02:25  FlyingZergling: ??? profit
02:25  suprlee: why tell people that if you're nicked as trumpisawesome
02:25  CzechsMix: Trump try my build

02:27  Nozdrum: he sould propably gg now ;)
02:27  FightingSpirit: Trump lost an scv, expect gg any second now
02:28  FlyingZergling: well you know for a fact he's not scouting now
02:28  juwil: "inconsistently"
02:28  FlyingZergling: or
02:28  FlyingZergling: he could move out
02:30  suprlee: put a supply at the back door ;>
02:30  suprlee: he'll dig in with roaches!
02:30  suprlee: oh nvm .p
02:31  Nozdrum: hope he will back up with tanks >_>
02:33  Acetyl: burrow vs. repair

02:35  suprlee: sounds like rhapsody :p
02:35  Nozdrum: no
02:36  CzechsMix: build a friggin missile turret!
02:36  GriffManstrong: zerg is on 9 bases
02:36  CzechsMix: why is it taking him this long?
02:36  LiquidJizz: just make marauders wtf
02:36  perryy: build a turret pleaz
02:36  lolzz: its gg
02:36  generisch: zerg should expand to trumps natural
02:36  generisch: just for the coolface
02:36  JQuik: why didnt he build a starport with a raven!?!?!
02:36  eAzy_: Roach rocks Thor's balls
02:37  FlyingZergling: uh burrowed roaches regen hp
02:37  CzechsMix: Roaches fast heal when burrowed
02:37  Acetyl: the roaches are like 2-2 or 2-3
02:37  CzechsMix: and oh yeah, they can move while burrowed...so you should build a turret!
02:37  trumpisawesome: zerg will eventually outmacro trump
02:37  Nozdrum: eventually^^?
02:37  lolzz: he already did
02:37  suprlee: if you're exping towards your opponent, wouldn't siege tanks be a lot better than thors
02:37  trumpisawesome: trump check the reply see where he expo'd
02:37  xtrop: no trump, that's the marine!
02:38  brandy: you dont seem to put much emphasis on upgrades.. why?
02:38  Nozdrum: why didnt you build a turret trump D: ?
02:38  SenkZ: Trump: try blue flame hellion vs Zerg as opening
02:38  FlyingZergling: thors can't beat you losing by 3 expos
02:38  sosoStarcraft: what's a good Trump drinking game I can play?
02:38  xtrop: supply block
02:38  Nozdrum: lol
02:38  Lanki: Trump engineering bay + turet would hav helped
02:38  generisch: sosoStarcraft: supply block
02:38  xtrop: was the classic one
02:38  Lanki: cuz u used too many scans one turret would have paid for itself
02:38  sosoStarcraft: ok, drinking every supply block
02:38  Acetyl: borring
02:39  SenkZ: true lanki
02:39  SenkZ: who knows rhapsody here?
02:39  syMptom: do the 4OC build :D
02:39  GriffManstrong: drinking every time he doesn't build a turret
02:39  generisch: 13 thor timing push, imho
02:39  Acetyl: I can't go bio because my ping on SEA averages 300
02:39  FlyingZergling: take a shot every minute past 3 he doesn't scout
02:39  Acetyl: Just cave to the pressure and go 5 marine 10 scv bunker rush
02:40  lolzz: its all about scout and desision
02:40  lolzz: decision*
02:40  FlyingZergling: ya really don't think in terms of "what he does counters me" because you've already lost like that
02:40  FlyingZergling: scout him out and say "ha ha what I do counters YOU"
02:41  SenkZ: why wall off vs protoss?
02:41  lolzz: good vs 4 gate rushes
02:41  Nozdrum: why not?
02:42  FightingSpirit: Zerg used to be Trump's best matchup
02:42  eAzy_: ???? TvT always been his best 
02:42  suprlee: it exposes supply depo's early in the game if you wall off
02:42  suprlee: and you lose income
02:42  lolzz: better than losing ur scv's
02:43  lolzz: normally u can hold off with scv repairing the depos
02:43  suprlee: well, you'll have to place your bunker behind, so if he goes robo he can hit your buildings from the ledge
02:43  suprlee: it's annoying I guess
02:43  Acetyl: I think Jinro showed us all last night that FE vs. 4 gate doesn't work too well
02:43  sosoStarcraft: void rays are really the only thing that makes walling off mildly scary
02:44  lolzz: XD mass marines melt through voidrays
02:44  FlyingZergling: mc made it look like fe vs protoss in general was a bad idea
02:44  sosoStarcraft: omg void rays
02:44  GriffManstrong: hes fucked
02:44  Nozdrum: 3gate stargate wtf xD ?
02:44  lolzz: LOL
02:44  GriffManstrong: LOLOLO
02:44  lolzz: nive FF

02:44  FlyingZergling: pick a void ray trump
02:44  lolzz: trmup dhould be ahead now
02:44  sosoStarcraft: I think toss A+moved
02:45  suprlee: that was some shitty void ray micro ;>
02:45  Acetyl: proxy SG?
02:45  lolzz: trump*
02:45  Nozdrum: there was... micro?
02:45  GriffManstrong: That pylon/sentry was slick imo
02:45  lolzz: yeah definitly
02:45  suprlee: pretty fancy
02:46  suprlee: just push with first ray and 5-6 zealots
02:46  suprlee: it rips through
02:46  Acetyl: there's no way he could have detection
02:47  Nozdrum: cannons?
02:47  Acetyl: mmm
02:47  lolzz: no stim ><
02:48  GriffManstrong: IF YOU HAD STIM 
02:48  suprlee: last time I watched this stream trump seemed a lot better
02:48  suprlee: did he stop playing?
02:48  Lanki: stupid protoss
02:48  Acetyl: Shit strat
02:48  Acetyl: plus his micro on all units was 1a
02:48  suprlee: banshee vs void ray
02:48  suprlee: take 1
02:49  ugs: just curious what are people runnign that is auto saving replays with a convermation waved file that plays after every game?
02:49  FightingSpirit: this is chrismtas music. nOoooo
02:49  shackes: grouping vikings with banshees really sux sometimes -_-
02:49  Victim: yeah, he stopped playing for cata beta
02:49  ugs: anyone know?
02:49  ShineDown: Hmmm cant get full screen ??? 
02:50  Victim: SC2gears has auto replay saving features

02:54  GriffManstrong: whoa
02:54  GriffManstrong: He's got a medivac already
02:54  Light__: against protoss
02:54  lolzz: marines are good vs anything when in a certain mass

02:59  Sheekthief: TRUMPETS
03:00  GriffManstrong: 4 ounces oof volda and 4 ouses of redbull is not the saem thing as 4 shots of liek aspresso and 4 beers
03:00  generisch: fucking turrets

03:00  lolzz: hmm trump u need to scout more
03:00  Light__: turrets
03:00  Light__: are better investment
03:00  Light__: because tvt is gas heavy
03:01  RuhRoh: Trump why no engie + turrets?
03:01  Lanki: No raven > turrets
03:01  Lanki: raven has PDD so you can offensively use them in the viking war later if need be
03:01  sosoStarcraft: trump, you're killing those of us who are drinking everytime you don't make a turret
03:01  Light__: but having one raven is always nice
03:01  Light__: yea
03:01  HypaSnipa: Lol.
03:01  Lanki: turrets only for defense
03:01  SenkZ: get both raven and turret
03:01  Lanki: raven u can use for defense or offense
03:01  SenkZ: he had 700 minerals
03:01  Lanki: both would be a waste of money
03:01  SenkZ: no
03:01  GriffManstrong: tramp if you dont build tureest iam going to dei
03:01  GriffManstrong: DIE
03:01  Lanki: yes

03:02  SenkZ: cuz you can u leave ur base without being scared losing ur base
03:02  Lanki: andyou need engineering bay for a turret too
03:02  sosoStarcraft: scouting is for pussies
03:02  Lanki: u can just leave some marines in ur base
03:02  Lanki: and if you have to use a scan

03:07  Light__: now youll have
03:07  Light__: tanks either unsieged 
03:07  Light__: move in with marauders
03:07  Light__: = rape
03:07  Light__: or tanks withotu support
03:07  Overload: that's what i usually do
03:07  Light__: it always works
03:07  Nozdrum: light just stop, its not trumps style
03:07  Light__: >_<
03:07  nosoup4u: a marine drop isnt his style?
03:08  nosoup4u: its like terran 101
03:08  nosoup4u: :P
03:08  xtrop: trump has never dropped much

03:09  Light__: and be like lawl at you!
03:09  nosoup4u: instead
03:10  Eldaflash: fast siege
03:10  neooffs: always leave the vikings over the cc
03:10  nosoup4u: i would assume
03:10  Light__: and then scan base to see turrets
03:10  Eldaflash: should be able to break through
03:10  nosoup4u: he's goin raven
03:10  nosoup4u: :o
03:10  neooffs: if you wanna be defensive you better scan a lot
03:11  art: what rating is trump these days?
03:11  neooffs: bronze
03:11  neooffs: lol sry
03:11  Nozdrum: grand master league
03:11  Nozdrum: 1
03:11  GriffManstrong: master bater more liek
03:11  Overload: 3rd scan is good to check for banshee
03:11  neooffs: this league is only on the pre-patch
03:12  LighT___: hmm
03:12  LighT___: I liked that contain
03:12  LighT___: that was interesting
03:12  nosoup4u: <.<!!
03:12  nosoup4u: landing vikings
03:12  Matt438: free viking
03:12  xtrop: it's a trap!
03:13  nosoup4u: ppl need to stop doing that
03:13  KingVietKong: This sounds like Sims music
03:13  KingVietKong: Should be picking out carpet not dropping pdd's
03:14  nosoup4u: wtf
03:15  nosoup4u: why is he not unsieging knowing he didnt have the air control :<
03:15  FightingSpirit: he is bad
03:15  KingVietKong: Same reason he landed 3 vikings to kill a single marine
03:15  Neith: supplies!!
03:15  nosoup4u: ya retorical question i guess
03:15  KingVietKong: I think I've only ever landed vikings effectively maybe twice
03:15  xtrop: why build supply depots when you can just kill off your army
03:16  godi_: pdd own
03:16  LighT___: no  YOU own
03:16  LighT___: >: (
03:16  nosoup4u: repair raven :oo
03:17  KingVietKong: Id like to see the maximum viking difference you can suffer with pdd available
03:17  nosoup4u: what do you mean by that? 
03:17  FightingSpirit: i like how trump actually repairs stuff. :D
03:17  KingVietKong: Ooo ballsy taking the middle expo
03:17  rowla: ouch
03:17  FightingSpirit: wow
03:17  GriffManstrong: oh god trump
03:17  GriffManstrong: why
03:17  xtrop: un-supply blocked
03:17  GriffManstrong: why trump
03:17  Victim: lol
03:17  Overload: lol
03:18  eAzy_: WHHHYYYY
03:18  KingVietKong: I mean like how fewer vikings you need if you have pdd, that would be an interesting test to run
03:18  godi_: why people never make like 2 banshee to snipe those tank
03:18  juwil: wow those marines died fast
03:18  KingVietKong: Because vikings annihalate banshees, it's possible but if there's a lot of viking play it's ineffective
03:18  nosoup4u: kamelot :o
03:18  LighT__: its ineffective
03:18  LighT__: all it takes is one turret
03:18  godi_: i mean, in a game like that
03:18  LighT__: to shut down
03:18  LighT__: shee sniping play
03:18  KingVietKong: And he already had the raven on field too
03:18  KingVietKong: Plus to get the banshee you nee dto sacrifice viking prodocutiong
03:19  eAzy_: why isnt any1 expanding to the other side of the map, just load up 5 SCVs
03:19  KingVietKong: Because he's got cajones
