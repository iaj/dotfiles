09:05  thesnowdog: Real estate agents. Are they all utter fsckwits? Are they born or made...hmm. Is it worth cutting off my nose to spite my face and beating mine to death.
09:06 * thesnowdog thinks it probably is.
09:10  John-Galt: You could compromise and beat her half to death?
09:11 * thesnowdog would never beat a lady
09:11  thesnowdog: I believe the weasel has balls
09:12  John-Galt: I think it's an honorific, like for boats and falcons.
09:12  John-Galt: Not that I'm suggesting that real estate agents are deserving of honor or anything.
09:13  thesnowdog: :)
09:41  tlonim: real estate is a scam
09:41  tlonim: look what happened in US because of that

10:27  Symmetry: just wondering, is there a static number of lines (for j/k/^u/^d scrolling) vertically shown on a page? Is there a way to find that? Or does it depend on the website
10:33  iaj: is someone up whos using the most recent version from mercurial + recent firefox 4?
11:26  christophe-marie: Do you guys have a shortcut to suscribe to a feed?
11:26  christophe-marie: I find myself toggling the adress bar all the time for clicking the damn rss icon...
11:27  John-Galt: :help :pageinfo
11:27  Utopiah: how can you actually open the lik once in :pa ?
11:28  Utopiah: (without using the mouse I mean)
11:28  John-Galt: ;o
11:28  John-Galt: But I use the mouse.
11:29  christophe-marie: nevermind, I found my way using emenu
11:29  christophe-marie: there's an entry in the bookmark menu to suscribe to feed
11:32  Utopiah: :command rss emenu Bookmarks.Subscribe to This Page.
11:41  iaj: should buffer! work in the most recent mercurial?
11:44  Symmetry: is there any way to use :command to let it be activated with a keyword? I want to bind :ys to :ytseek, but retain the number completion ability
11:44  John-Galt: Yes, but depending on your firefox version you need to run with -purgecaches
11:44  John-Galt: (unless you're using an XPI)
11:45  John-Galt: Symmetry: Probably. :js commands.get("ytseek").names.push("ys")
11:46  Symmetry: will that retain through sessions?
11:47  Symmetry: er, be retained
11:47  John-Galt: Of course not.
11:48  Symmetry: It doesn't seem to have worked anyway - I applied it in a youtube tab, tried, refreshed, and tried again
11:49  iaj: John-Galt: I tried /Applications/Minefield/.../firefox -purgecaches  but that didn't work out :(
11:50  John-Galt: What Firefox version?
11:50  iaj: John-Galt: the keybindings changed as well? eg instead of noremap key i need to do map -mode=... key -builtin <key>
11:50  iaj: John-Galt: minefield 4.0b8pre
11:50  iaj: built 7.dec.
11:51  John-Galt: Have you tried an xpi?
11:51  John-Galt: Oh, is it only :noremap that's broken? That might make sense...
11:51  iaj: John-Galt: nah noremap is broken as well
11:51  iaj: but when I type :buffer!<CR>
11:52  iaj: pentadactyl: TypeError: t.linkedBrowser.lastURI is null  < is what I get
11:52  iaj: and I didn't try an xpi yet - which xpi do you mean?
11:54  John-Galt: Any one. Shouldn't matter. As for the lastURI thing, that might be a bug, but I haven't had any such problems.
11:55  iaj: hmmm okay -_- dunno what's going wrong then.. still I switch buffers mainly with  b which is usually mapped to :buffer!  but can't use it anymore :(
11:55  iaj: no problems at all @4903
11:55  John-Galt: What, you're mapping it yourself?
11:56  iaj: entering :buffer! as well ain't working too :(
11:57  iaj: i got a  map b :b   i just reckon
12:00  John-Galt: But that mapping is builtin...
12:21  iaj: oh.. ok.. yeah well - ;) dunno where that one's coming from .. :buffer! ain't working for me no matter if I do -purgecaches or not
12:23  John-Galt: :echo array.nth
12:23  iaj: sec need to tech up to that version
12:25  iaj: http://pastebin.com/A1rkMbEr
12:27  John-Galt: Ok.
12:27  iaj: John-Galt: when I do a firefox --help  I don't see an option -purgecaches
12:28  John-Galt: No, you wouldn't. firefox -help is rarely useful.
12:31  iaj: http://pastebin.com/x7P9M841  that's my console output 
12:31  iaj: after running firefox with -purgecaches
12:56  Symmetry: oh wow! Just noticed something incredibly awesome about PD: when you go to Upload File forms, it doesn't open that horrible little dialog box, it lets me type in my autocompleting path/file
12:57  John-Galt: Yep.
12:58  iaj: ok so I went back to 4903 again :-)
12:59  Symmetry: I have been looking for anything that does that for literally years. Firefox back in the 1.5 days didn't pop open a dialog box, though it didn't autocomplete, and the fact that PD does that is incredible
13:03  iaj: Symmetry: I didn't come across such a page with an upload field - do you have an example for it? I wanna check it out :-)
13:10  Symmetry: iaj: imagebin.ca is one
13:11  Symmetry: also, John-Galt, in case you didn't know some types of overlay (like photobucket's when trying to log in via facebook, perhaps some others) mask the hints numbers but not the shading, so I have to use the mouse (or tab through, which is unpleasant)
13:13  iaj: Symmetry: Oh i have to select the field by hints.. else i get that dialog box thrown at me
13:13  iaj: but nice indeed
13:14  iaj: would be just nice if <c-d> would shown the possible completion possibilites in that mode
13:14  Symmetry: iaj: I don't use my mouse any more, I didn't even think to test it with that, but noted
13:15  Symmetry: <C-d>? That just scrolls down a predetermined amount for me
13:16  Symmetry: unless you don't mean ctrl-d
13:20  iaj: i mean c-d but I'm used from the shell (and vims ex mode as well) to show possible completion matches
13:20  iaj: Symmetry: which hintmode are you using?  or rather - which hintkeys?
13:21  Symmetry: f
13:21  iaj: oO  i mean.. numbers or have you a setting for 'hintkeys
13:22  Symmetry: ah, no, numbers...I think
13:22  iaj: thanks ;)
13:22  Symmetry: if it's what I think you're asking this should explain http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/5743/windowclippingm.png
13:23  iaj: yeah those are numbered hints :)
13:23  iaj: hmm is that the basic coloring of them?
13:23  Symmetry: yep
13:24  Symmetry: I changed the size though
13:24  Symmetry: I use a large resolution and sit a few feet back, so I couldn't see them at 10pt
13:24  iaj: which setting is that?
13:24  iaj: ah.. yeah sure :)
13:27  Symmetry: one sec, finding the setting
13:29  Symmetry: take a look at :h highlight, or do :highlight hint <tab complete for default value and modify>
13:38  iaj: there are default values - tab only gives me the list of the possible settings.. no?
13:38  iaj: oh i have to do :highlight hint<CR> to see the current values
13:38  iaj: thanks Symmetry  :)
13:38 * thesnowdog attempts to solve the great key mapping calamity
13:38  Symmetry: iaj: type in the following:
13:39 * thesnowdog really too tired to read through this...
13:39  Symmetry: :highlight hint <Tab>
13:39  Symmetry: with the space
13:39  Symmetry: it should bring up the default value, ready for editing
13:39  John-Galt: thesnowdog: According to someone above :noremap is broken but :map -b isn't. I'll figure it out if you don't, assuming :noremap turns out to fail for me, too.
13:40  iaj: Symmetry: strange for me it doesn't.. its bringing up all the css options... do you mean 'hint' or 'Hint' ?
13:40  iaj: guess 'Hint'
13:41  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Sure findMode() is broken now?  In as much as modes are now funky enhanced objects? i.e. the initial test should now be for typeof name == "object"?
13:41  thesnowdog: *surely
13:41 * thesnowdog close to fading away
13:42  thesnowdog: ...and the map() in addMapCommands now essentially ignores the second arg?  Unless I'm overlooking something obvious.
13:43  thesnowdog: obvious being magical
13:45 * thesnowdog rambling
13:45  John-Galt: Hm, yeah, that'd probably do it. And, yeah, I noticed that about the second arg.
13:45  John-Galt: It's now the default value for -modes. Not sure why I didn't kill the second arg. The whole thing is closed over that variable anyway, so the second arg is a bit silly.
13:47  John-Galt: It should be isinstance(name, Number), perhaps. Or !isString, even. I'll have to look at it later.
13:47  thesnowdog: Well I really am too tired to fix and check even a simple thing like that so I'll leave it to you or have a look in the morning. :)
13:48  John-Galt: Same here.
13:48  thesnowdog: stepnem: ^
15:38 --- reticulum.oftc.net sets modes [#pentadactyl +v CIA-8]
16:50  tlonim: are they keys fixed now ?
17:36 --- remi_ is now known as remi
20:56 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * a759128675968bc3c601fbe3276fe983d255d042 /common/ (content/mappings.js modules/util.jsm) Fix :noremap. (Probably) Fixes issue #168.
21:45 * John-Galt would very nearly kill for an egg sandwich right now...
22:15  John-Galt: Phillip Pullman is, I think, now one of my favorite authors of all time.
22:16 * John-Galt makes mince meat of the topic...
23:15  John-Galt: That's a rather busy issue tracker thread...
23:15  John-Galt: I daren't even read all of it.
23:32  thesnowdog: John-Galt: My thoughts exactly...
23:35  thesnowdog: What exciting thing is util.compileFormat going to do?
23:59  iaj: how comes sometimes I get a <hintkey>:<hintlabel> and sometimes not when hitting f?
