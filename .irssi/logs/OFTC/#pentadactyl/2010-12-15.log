00:15  John-Galt: Thank the gods.
03:34  John-Galt: It actually takes over a GB of memory just to link libxul. Amazing.
05:05 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 2760f5fe766b7475cf4b623909b01a74ea1b70ed /common/ (9 files in 3 dirs) Completion of certain chrome:, resource:, and about: URLs.
05:26  John-Galt: I think that perhaps whoever designed the mozilla-central tree is some sort of malevolent sadomasochist.
05:26  John-Galt: Whoever designed the test system even moreso.
05:26  John-Galt: *more so
05:54  John-Galt: Ugh.
06:47  tlonim: yeah, building from mozilla-central with libxul bloats memory..
06:48  tlonim: quite inefficient since I tend to use more of system libs than the bundled ones

11:15  John-Galt: stepnem: It might, but a) it's not going to happen any time soon, and b) he's a moron.
11:15  stepnem: Well, he's just a Chinese...
11:15  stepnem: :-))
11:15  John-Galt: And that excuses him for being a moron?
11:16  stepnem: It may at least partly explain why you got that impression.
11:16  John-Galt: It has nothing to do with it.
11:19  stepnem: He even deleted the introductory note! Take graffatcolmingov...
11:21 --- josue is now known as j0su3
12:01  John-Galt: True. He's a moron with a redeeming quality.

13:42  Chousuke: hmm, size-changing mouseover effects seem not to be a good idea for elements close together.
13:42  Chousuke: if I position my mouse between them, the effect flickers on and off rapidly because the size changes :P
13:53  mcbeth: I've seen lots of software do that before (including Word).  Definitely annoying
13:56  Chousuke: I think size-changing elements in general are a horrible idea though.
13:57  Chousuke: or at least if you do it, it should have a purpose instead of being just a fancy effect :P
14:14  mcbeth: I definitely agree. I did not intend for you to understand that Word is a pillar of good design, quite the contrary.  Emacs often uses different font sizes in its syntax hilighting to horribly distracting effect
14:15  stepnem: Interesting. I've never seen anything like that, and I'm a heavy Emacs user.
14:18  stepnem: The only crazy default syntax highlighting I remember was the Perl one, but even that didn't involve multiple font sizes as far as I recall. And anything like that doesn't even make much sense as default anyway, as it is also supposed to work in a terminal.
14:18  stepnem: Anyway, off-topic, and you're obviously just babbling.
14:19  mcbeth: sorry
14:20 * thesnowdog was unaware of a topic
14:21  mcbeth: Where are the caret mode key bindings documented?
14:22  thesnowdog: mcbeth: That is a good question with a poor answer
14:22  thesnowdog: ...they're not.
14:22  stepnem: Last time I looked, even the mode itself was not documented, let alone the key bindings.
14:22  thesnowdog: But they're often the same as TEXT_EDIT mode
14:23 * thesnowdog lobbied for it's removal
14:23  mcbeth: okay, I was looking for text selection and discovered v and y based on vi experience.  The document mentions 'i' to enter the mode
14:23  mcbeth: is there a better way to perform text selection then?
14:23  stepnem: We're waiting for John-Galt to autogenerate the docs :-P
14:23  thesnowdog: mcbeth: If you're brave you can look in editor.js
14:24  thesnowdog: Yes, use the mouse.  It won't hurt I promise.
14:25  thesnowdog: mcbeth: That said, some folks swear they're faster using CARET mode
14:26  mcbeth: I had found the mouse, but was looking more idiomatic method
14:26  mcbeth: I doubt I'm faster, although 'y' vs 'Y' gets me every time
14:27  thesnowdog: If you don't like 'em, switch 'em
14:28  mcbeth: yup, you have done a great job.  Between you guys and i3wm, I have a pretty consistent key binding environment most of the time
14:37  iaj: there is a TEXT_EDIT mode?  how do I reach it?
14:38  stepnem: iaj: :h text-edit
