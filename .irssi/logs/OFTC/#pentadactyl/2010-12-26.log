21:38  graffatcolmingov: Can I install the repo to two different profiles or only one at a time?
21:39  graffatcolmingov: If that didn't make sense, smack me.
21:40 * stepnem smacks graffatcolmingov
21:40  stepnem: graffatcolmingov: You just use the trick described on the SF page.
21:40  stepnem: You can insinuate as many profiles as you wish that way.
21:41  John-Galt: There's a trick destribed on the SF page?
21:41  stepnem: Well, you know what I mean, don't you.
21:41  stepnem: Using the text file pointing to the repo.
21:41  John-Galt: Not really... I know the tricks I use, I just don't know that they're documented. Except for the whole 'make install' bit.
21:41  John-Galt: Ok.
21:42  graffatcolmingov: So I can do it for several profiles then without an issue?
21:42  stepnem: Yes.
21:42  graffatcolmingov: Ok good.
21:43  John-Galt: I'm actually running three different versions of Pentadactyl on three different profiles out of the same repo at the moment... not that I can recommend it.
21:53  graffatcolmingov: crap how do I specify which profile?
21:53  John-Galt: firefox -help
21:54  graffatcolmingov: No I know -P for firefox, I meant for the Makefile
21:54  John-Galt: (in practice, usually the -P <name> flag, but sometimes the -profile <path> flag, or the -profilemenager flag if you're desperate)
21:54  John-Galt: Ah, in that case, make help, but in practice, make install PROFILE=<name>
21:54  graffatcolmingov: Ah
21:55  graffatcolmingov: Thanks
21:55  graffatcolmingov: Sorry I'm such a schmuck
22:00  John-Galt: Eh, happens.
23:46  John-Galt: Should I release the beta now, or are there bugs that should be fixed first?
23:47  John-Galt: I'd really like to decide on the <[ ... ]> syntax first, granted, but have to wait to ask Doug his opinion...
23:48 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 63c1a270dc0084255ac595f38c9c913351e2ee75 /common/ (5 files in 2 dirs) [bootstrap] Merge default.
