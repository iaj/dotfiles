00:02  John-Galt: Well, use a nightly, then.
01:41  anon33_: John-Galt: is the latest nightly crashing on you? i'm using the latest nightly of pent and firefox (minefield) and it keeps crashing on me
01:46  anon33_: it appears to be one of the addons...
01:48  heftig_: John-Galt: seems they got rid of the obligatory spring in the addon bar. you can now remove it using "customize"
01:57  John-Galt: anon33_: Minefield? Of course. That's why it's called Minefield. Don't use Minefield. Are you insane?
01:57  John-Galt: heftig_: Ok. I'll remove it on first run in the future, then.
01:58  John-Galt: Although I don't see it in the latest TraceMonkey nightly at all. I suppose they haven't merged in a while.
01:58 --- heftig_ is now known as heftig
01:59  heftig: yes, i'm using mozilla-central
02:00  John-Galt: Yep, there it is.
02:00  anon33_: well...
02:00  anon33_: mozilla-central 4.0b8pre is nicknamed minefield i thought
02:00  heftig: it is
02:01  anon33_: well that's what i'm using, it just says minefield on it
02:01  heftig: it's a minefield
02:02  John-Galt: anon33_: There's no reason as a user to use Minefield. The only reason I run it is so that I don't get bogged down with a landslide of brokenness when they release a beta.
02:04  anon33_: John-Galt: so what nightly do you suggest? the pentadactyl nightly?
02:04  John-Galt: Yes.
02:04  anon33_: oh well...that makes sense
02:18 --- peth_ is now known as peth
10:52  tlonim: thesnowdog: so they want to bring back Warne now :P
12:02  thesnowdog: tlonim: Yep, it's desperation unseen in living memory. ;-)  I hear AB is in the pipeline too for some middle order grit.
12:02 * thesnowdog was somewhat disgusted to notice the Harbour Bridge is lit up with a huge "
12:02  thesnowdog: O" when crossing it tonight.
12:04  tlonim: thesnowdog: AB == allan Border ? LOL
12:04  thesnowdog: Yep, Steve Waugh is busy saving India.  Or so I hear...
12:06  tlonim: Symonds is pretty good
12:06  tlonim: but due to his antics 
12:06  tlonim: he lost his place
12:06  thesnowdog: But he prefers to fish than attend team meetings so he's out.
12:07  thesnowdog: There's also talk of bringing Bret Lee back from Bollywood to knock 'em over. ;-)
12:08  tlonim: oh..yeah
12:08  tlonim: he was not in Ashes right
12:08  tlonim: lol
12:08  tlonim: he is not form 
12:08  tlonim: right ?
12:08  thesnowdog: He actually attended the last Test and was lurking around the nets...
12:08  tlonim: in form*
12:08  thesnowdog: Compared to our current hacks he may well be 'in form'.
12:12  thesnowdog: tlonim: I am in favour of a Warne return though, if only so we can pull him off the air. His talk show is appalling.
12:12  tlonim: lol
12:12  tlonim: yeah..i  heard about that
12:12  tlonim: on Sky right ?
12:12  tlonim: may be he can return as a coach
12:15  thesnowdog: On Channel Nine, a free to air commercial channel.  It might be getting a run on Sky in the UK and elsewhere but I hope not.
12:16  tlonim: as a coach he should do well
12:16  thesnowdog: To be honest, he's generally pretty thick but he does have a good 'cricket brain' so he could at least be selected as a specialist captain.  Which he should have been all along...
12:17  thesnowdog: Ponting is generally pretty thick and that is all.
12:24 * thesnowdog heads out into the driveway to practice his off-breaks in the hope of a call up in Sydney
17:54  zeltak: hmmm i think latest penta update broke my greader passthorugh option
17:54  zeltak: au LocationChange 'google\.com/reader'  -js modes.set(modes.PASS_THROUGH)
17:54  zeltak: was working in the last few weeks
18:41  zeltak: ok weirder..ive updated firefox-nightly and now penta is completly screwd...tab completion is acting weird
18:43  zeltak: example screenshot: http://paste.xinu.at/IylE/
18:43  zeltak: i type help and tab and this is the result..also the penta lower bar is all messed up
19:08  iaj: zeltak: use firefox.. not minefield-- are you?
19:08  iaj: I had the same problem
19:09  iaj: now using firefox/4.0b7
19:09  iaj: all smooth here :-)
19:09  zeltak: iaj: what distro your using?
19:10  iaj: osx10.6
19:10  zeltak: ahhh gotcha :)
19:10  zeltak: ill try yo switch thx

20:06  anon33_: John-Galt: do you plan to add any support to adding a command that pins tabs?
21:43  patrick8_: hi
21:43  patrick8_: what's the difference between the "regular" firefox nightly and the tracemonkey nightlies?
22:14  John-Galt: patrick8_: Nothing in particular. The TraceMonkey tree has the most recent JavaScript engine changes. They usually merge every week or so.
22:15  John-Galt: zeltak: For the love of god, don't use Minefield.
22:22  anon33_: hey John-Galt, did you take out -js buffer.followLink(doc.getElementById("")); ?
22:22  John-Galt: Take out?
22:24  John-Galt: Interesting... It's apparently possible to sue someone for blasphemy in Pakastan because they threw out your business card, if your name is Muhammad.
22:24  anon33_: John-Galt: well, doc is returning an error
22:25  John-Galt: Well, it's a string.
22:28  anon33_: hm, for some reason using document isntead of doc works
22:28  anon33_: as it probably should - anyways, using document.getElementById(":pt")) says the elem is null which is weird.
22:29  John-Galt: Not weird. document refers to the main document for the top-level window, not the content. You possibly want content.document
22:33  anon33_: well, this is using the buffer in focus right?
22:33  zeltak: ok John-Galt stoped using it (using b7 now) but the passthrogh on greader still isnt working
22:34  zeltak: been using minefiled for a while now bte but never had any issues up to today
22:36  John-Galt: anon33_: Yes.
22:37  John-Galt: zeltak: Donno. Should still work.
22:37  anon33_: js buffer.focusElement(content.document.getElementById(":pv")); returns TypeError: elem is null
22:38  anon33_: nevermind, that actually worked
22:38  anon33_: but i'm trying to focus on something where the elements id's are going to be constantly changing (gmail) - is it possible to focus on an element just by finding text? 
22:39  John-Galt: Yes.
22:39  zeltak: John-Galt: this is what i currently have:
22:39  zeltak:  au LocationChange 'google\.com/reader'  -js modes.set(modes.PASS_THROUGH)    
22:39  zeltak: is it the correct syntax?
22:40  John-Galt: Should be fine, yes.
22:40  anon33_: John-Galt: content.document.get... ?
22:40  zeltak: mmmm weird its not working here
22:40  John-Galt: anon33_: Yes.
22:40  John-Galt: zeltak: Works for me.
22:40  anon33_: John-Galt: i mean, what would i use to look for text?
22:41  zeltak: mmm do you want me to try anything or do you think its not a bug?
22:41  John-Galt: anon33_: Ah, sorry. Not entirely awake. Tou'd need to use an XPath. Can you be more specific?
22:42  anon33_: christ i hate xpath... um, the text contains the word "Tasks" in it - looking to focus on the google tasks popup in gmail
22:42  John-Galt: zeltak: Hard to say. I don't see why it shouldn't work, or why it should stop working. It still works fine for me. Why don't you just use 'passkeys'?
22:43  John-Galt: anon33_: Do you want the direct parent of the text node with the element containing Tasks?
22:44  anon33_: if it will get focus, sure
22:45  anon33_: zeltak: this is what i have for google reader, maybe it will help you: set passkeys+='google\.com/reader':jkvnpbumoaAXNOVPJK?gehtl<Return>
22:46  John-Galt: It might. util.evaluateXPath("//*[contains(./text(), 'Tasks')]").snapshotItem(0)
22:47  anon33_: so in total that's buffer.focusLink.util ... ?
22:48  John-Galt: No, buffer.focusLink(util...
22:48  zeltak: ok John-Galt ill try that now
22:51  zeltak: John-Galt: works like a charm :)
22:51  zeltak: thx John-Galt 
22:52  John-Galt: Sure, but I'm pretty sure that anon33_ gave you the incantation...
22:56  John-Galt: Grr! Why do they send me personal emails? Where do they find my address? It's not advertised...
22:57  zeltak: anyone signed up for the chrome cr-48 :)?
23:00  John-Galt: God no.
23:02  zeltak: heheh ..hey a free laptop :)
23:03  John-Galt: True, but in return you have to use web-based apps for everything you do, which I don't and have no desire to do.
23:07  zeltak: well im hoping that in case of the slight chance i do get it someone will hack it and i can run nix on it :)
23:07  John-Galt: Heh. Well, a) Chrome OS is Linux based, as I recall, and b) I don't think that's part of the deal.
23:09  zeltak: honestly i have no idea what the deal is it doesnt say anywhere..do the people who got it get to keep it? are you supposed to report back to google? if so and if i do get it ill send it back :)
23:10  zeltak: the web is full of people who already got it..seems like alot of people got it (they say they have like 60,000 units to give away)
23:10  John-Galt: Hm.
23:10  zeltak: im sure somene will hack it soon
23:10  John-Galt: Well, I'm all for free hardware.
23:10  zeltak: heheh thats my point :)
23:11  zeltak: the last thing ill do is use web apps as my mainOS and i think most users who get it will to :)
23:11  John-Galt: It definitely says that you need to provide regular feedbark.
23:11  zeltak: well in my registration they had a checkox asking if you want to or not
