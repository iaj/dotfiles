01:15  Chousuke: (just reading through the recent commits to see what's happening)
01:15  John-Galt: Heh. Why?
01:16  John-Galt: It's temporary, anyway. Modes are going to be real classes with instances in the future.
01:16  Chousuke: I'm not sure what it's supposed to do if it really is intended to be like htat :P
01:17  John-Galt: Ah. I'll be damned... I just re-read it...

01:23  Monkey: While we're going WTF.  mode.{disp,display,description} makes me go hmmm at first glance.
01:25  John-Galt: Yeah, they need to be cleaned up. The disp one, anyway. It's old and was an ugly hack to begin with.
01:25  John-Galt: Don't see the issue with description.
01:36  John-Galt: Oh, lovely, : now opens the command-line in insert mode?
01:36 * John-Galt wonders if that bug made the nightly.
01:38  Chousuke: not happening for me
01:38  Chousuke: or at least I think it isn't.

02:56  milant: hi. i just posted a q on the mail list regarding using bookmarklets located in the bookmarks bar w/ pentadactyl. and then i found the irc 1 minute after :P
02:57  milant: are there any examples or "best practices" for integrating pentadactyl w/ instapepr/delicious/etc. bookmarklets?
02:59  John-Galt: Not really. Just add bookmark keywords and open them.
03:03  milant: @john-galt ok. thnx
03:05  milant: so no way to set kybd bindings to the browser's bookmarklets?
03:06  John-Galt: :help :map

03:39  John-Galt: Nope.
03:42  milant: i JUST picked up vim and pentadactyl yesterday. so apologies for the supergenius questions. :)
03:42  John-Galt: Heh. No worries.
03:42  John-Galt: I've always hated <leader> at any rate, but they won't let me get rid of it.
03:42  milant: is the <Leader>/<leader> difference similar to how vim has it?
03:43  John-Galt: There's no difference in either case. Case is insignificant in key names.

05:01  John-Galt: O.o Are you reading the New York Post or something?

05:03  John-Galt: Almost as bad...
05:03  John-Galt: Worse on some counts...
05:03  thesnowdog: http://tinyurl.com/4zbe4fu
05:04  John-Galt: They're the ones who like to go on about how homeopathy is god's gift to humanity and vaccines cause autism, aren't they?
05:04  thesnowdog: ...you're so judgmental
05:04  thesnowdog: No idea but that's how I like to think of homeopathy.
05:05  thesnowdog: I'd never heard of the Huffington Post prior to this.
05:05  John-Galt: Well, it's hard not to be judgemental of people wo think that pure water is the most potent form of medial treatment available... and gets more powerful the more it's diluted.
05:05  thesnowdog: Heh, if it works for them.
05:06  John-Galt: Yeah, placebos have their uses.
05:06  John-Galt: And telling people that vaccines will give their kids autism? That's alright?
05:06  thesnowdog: A friend of mine who is a doctor goes off like a cracker every time it's mentioned.
05:07  John-Galt: Heh
05:07  thesnowdog: Well telling anyone anything is alright.
05:08  milant: q: is anyone using ffox in fullscreen mode? wondering what the intended display of the commandline and statusline are in fullscreen?
05:08  John-Galt: Whatever you set them to be.
05:09  milant: they disappear off the botttom of the screen for me in fullscreen (i'm on nightlies for both ffox and pentadactyl)
05:09  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Maybe. Nevertheless it's leading to epidemics or whooping cough and measles already.
05:09  John-Galt: Especially the former in infants, and especially in your country at that.
05:09  John-Galt: milant: You can turn them back on.
05:10  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Sure, that topic sets my sister of like a cracker. :)
05:11  thesnowdog: John-Galt: We like to be ahead of the game down here.  It's the Vitamin K shots...everyone knows it.
05:12  milant: john-galt: u mean w/ set go=cs?
05:13  John-Galt: thesnowdog: But surely a *vitamin* can't do any harm?
05:13  John-Galt: milant: +=
05:13  milant: in full screen the command-line is gone (it's there in non-fullscreen)
05:13  milant: ya +=, same thing
05:14  John-Galt: Not really...
05:14  John-Galt: The command-line is hidden by default anyway.
05:16  milant: no, i meant the same issue either way. command-line won't appear when i hit :
05:17  milant: seems to be blocked by the status bar. tho the status-bar displays "COMMAND LINE"
05:17  John-Galt: I think you want a C in there.
05:18  John-Galt: Hm. Interesting. No status bar either way...
05:18  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Well who's to say what it really is... And bleeding to death isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  When you're that young it's not as though you understand.
05:18  John-Galt: Stupid bloody moz-collapsed attribute. I thought I fixed that.
05:19  John-Galt: milant: :au fullscreen .* statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
05:19  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Whooping cough doesn't lead to bleeding to death, it leads to death by suffocation.
05:20  thesnowdog: Vitamin K ^
05:20  John-Galt: Aah.
05:20  John-Galt: :) I was confused for a minute...
05:23  milant: john-galt; thnx. but it gives the error "E216: no such group or event: fullscreen"
05:23  milant: tho i can still :set fullscreen
05:25  John-Galt: Fullscreen rather.
05:25  thesnowdog: John-Galt: FWIW, most of my family on both sides (the generation above me) had whooping cough.  I don't think they recommend it.
05:26  John-Galt: Heh
05:27 * John-Galt considers whether constructing HTML from strings should be a hanging offense. Especially when said strings are composed of fragments grabbed from wild Internet pages and injected into a document with chrome privileges...
05:29  milant: i get E492 not a pentadactyl command: statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
05:29  John-Galt: :au Fullscreen .* -js statusline.statusBar.removeAttribute("moz-collapsed")
05:29  milant: should i have that in my rc file?
05:29  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Shouldn't autocommands be case insensitive?
05:32  milant: ok. i had to throw it in my rc. then source my rc from ffox. seems to work now.

05:36  John-Galt: Keypress handling is too slow now.

05:39  milant: this gives an error of "invalid option" :noremap - zo
05:39  milant: yet "noremap + zo" works fine
05:39  milant: is - reserved in vim?
05:39  John-Galt: That's because - starts an option. You need to quote it.
05:41  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I guess so...
05:42  milant: ah, ok.

06:25  milant: what is the diff between "map <C-k> -ex open javascript:function....." and "map <C-k> :open javascript:function...."?
06:26  milant: also, should the javascript bookmarklets be opened with the -js option?
06:26  John-Galt: The former is much more efficient and reliable. The latter acts exactly as if you'd typed all of those keys.
06:27  John-Galt: Bookmarklets should be opened like any other bookmarks.
06:31  milant: ok. for debugging/feedback, is the best thing to just crank verbose=infinity? or 15...? :P

07:26  John-Galt: Probably after you complained about key bindings not working in the MOW like they used to and I "fixed" it...
07:34  thesnowdog: I don't actually know much about homeopathy.  I don't think it's ever come up in a conversation in my entire life except the aforementioned rants of my friend.

07:37  John-Galt: Then I found out what it was and I was dumbfounded...
07:37  John-Galt: _temp_: :h g;
07:37  _temp_: John-Galt: thanks, i'll see.
07:38  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Is Goldacre the bloke you mentioned who was sued for critizing chiropractors?
07:38  John-Galt: He was one of them. Simon Singh was the other. I think Goldacre might have been sued by homeopaths...
07:39  _temp_: John-Galt: thanks, i was used to vimperator's ;f :)
07:39  John-Galt: Ah, he got sued by some asshole who he criticized for selling vitamin pills to Africans as a cure for AIDS...
07:40  thesnowdog: Well it's better than raping white devils I suppose.
07:40  John-Galt: _temp_: Vimperator's ;F was a horrible idea. Someone sent a patch. I said we shouldn't accept it, but...
07:45  tlonim: so homeopathy is placebo based ?

07:46  John-Galt: homeopathy ≡ placebo
07:46  thesnowdog: tlonim: It's water based.
07:46  John-Galt: It's water.
07:46  thesnowdog: I think I'd always thought it was a seventies thing.  Along with crystals. *shrug*
07:47  John-Galt: :) There was one scientist who ruined his career by publishing a paper promoting the idea that water has memory (no-one could reproduce the results)...
07:47  John-Galt: Now :) This is precious...
07:47  John-Galt: He sells homeopathic remedies that work over the phone and Internet.
07:48  tlonim: hmm
07:48  thesnowdog: Oh, I recall that.
07:48  John-Galt: I almost felt bad for the guy before I found that out.
07:48  thesnowdog: Apparently it's all in the shaking after each dilution.  I understand now.
07:49  John-Galt: Yep. Witchcraft.
07:52  tlonim: hehe
07:52  tlonim: but you know for certain things placebo miraculously works 
07:53  tlonim: we think we are healthy, we will be .. :)
07:53  tlonim: but it won't work for serious ailments
07:53  tlonim: may be thats how homeopathy has gained traction
07:53  tlonim: I have seen it being used mainly for cold related stuff
07:56  John-Galt: Well, as it happens, a lot of "homeopathic" remedies have actual ingredients. Zicam, for instance, has zinc, which is why it caused people to lose their sense of smell. "Homeopathic" pink eye remedies have boric acid, which is why they actually work.
07:57  tlonim: i have seen homeopathic treatments being used in places where the side effects of normal medicines are too severe
07:58  tlonim: which again applies for cough cold related ones 
08:13  thesnowdog: Oprah considers here Aussie experience the most loving of her life. Awww
08:14  John-Galt: Hmm...
08:14  John-Galt: She has her own entire TV network now. Somewhat more dismaying to me than her opinion of Australia...
08:15  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You should come here -- we can love you too.
08:18  John-Galt: Heh. I think not. I've heard about the kind of rubbish you people call beer.
08:18 * thesnowdog thinks all beer is rubbish
08:19  John-Galt: See. Point proven.
08:21  iaj: got the error: attempt to execute mapping recursively - got j mapped to : nv j * -builtin 4j  - that's comin up when I keep pressing j
08:21  tlonim: iaj: nnoremap ?
08:22  John-Galt: Interesting. And: fuck, because I merged that change into the beta branch.
08:22  tlonim: oh..something broke ? 
08:22  John-Galt: Ah, we're good. It works as expected.
08:23  iaj: thanks for the nnoremap hint.
08:23  John-Galt: Don't be silly. That's what -builtin does.
08:27  iaj: Huh?
08:27  John-Galt: :map -builtin does the same thing as :noremap
08:28  tlonim: ah.yes.. builtin thing does same
08:37 * thesnowdog wonders if the intro page should contain a brief "Migrating from that other extension" section
08:37  John-Galt: Blech. I thought about adding a faq.
08:38  iaj: Hmm, I still got the recursively problem - oh well I'll just stick to C-f C-b

08:39  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Well I thought it would be more 'competitive' in the help.
08:39  iaj: tlonim: lawl
08:40  tlonim: i have heard of other folks tattooing equations on their hand/body and stuff
08:40  John-Galt: thesnowdog: But the FAQs *are* in the help...
08:40  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Oh, yeah.
08:40 * thesnowdog wonders what a "just before bed" implementation might break over night
08:40  John-Galt: tlonim: I think I saw that on The Loom. I'm not above copyint it...
08:41  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Probably quite a lot of stuff. Which means I'll have some time to fix it before the nightly comes out.
08:41  thesnowdog: John-Galt: When does the nightly go out for the record.
08:41 * thesnowdog could look he guesses
08:42  John-Galt: iaj: Oh, I didn't even realize that was what you pasted...
08:42  John-Galt: thesnowdog: 0:00UTC
08:42  iaj: John-Galt: i know - what a timing :D
08:43  iaj: You were 6 seconds before me :-(
08:44  thesnowdog: John-Galt: :)
08:48  thesnowdog: Hmmm, my console is telling me to "KILL, KILL, KILL!"...or is it just the voices again?
08:49  John-Galt: Oh. I thought I'd removed them...
08:50  thesnowdog: ...just trying to be amusing.
08:51  John-Galt: Yeah, they're amusing sometimes. But those usually aren't the times when they're shouting "KILL, KILL, KILL".
08:53  iaj: How could I map jj to <esc> in textareas?
08:53  iaj: or input fields in general :-)
08:53  John-Galt: Probably with :tmap jj <Esc>
08:55  iaj: Thanks John-Galt !   And another question would be, I know you don't like them, but is there a way to have quickmark opened in background tab?
08:55  John-Galt: :help 'activate'
08:57  iaj: mhhh ok... so Id need to switch modes every time...  Thanks
08:58 * John-Galt wonders why there's no gN...
08:58  thesnowdog: tstrycova
08:58  thesnowdog: Oops
08:59  John-Galt: 22:46  * thesnowdog finds cryp abbs cryp
09:00  iaj: John-Galt: heh... wondered too :)
09:01  thesnowdog: Well it was supposed to be :t strycova
09:01  thesnowdog: She's a tennis player.
09:02  thesnowdog: ...playing our Australian-again Dokic.
09:02  iaj: And playing soon.
09:03  thesnowdog: Hmmm, on court now and I need to buy some sausages for the BBQ first. My life is so very hard.
09:03  thesnowdog: Yay for pause.
09:40  iaj: Ohh you'r from australia - I wondered what time you gonna go for BBQ :D
09:58  CIA-6: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * bab280d85eebaa812a4dfdb668c1e6eea12d6e93 /common/ (7 files in 2 dirs) Add as-yet undocumented site-specific mapping hives, :map -group flag, and :mapgroup command.

09:59 * John-Galt seriously considers ditching CIA-6 for eris_prime...
10:01  iaj: John-Galt: hmmm cool! Thanks!
10:01  iaj: Could you gimme an example
10:04  John-Galt: Huh? It's *undocumented*...
10:04  John-Galt: Oh, bugger it.
10:04  John-Galt: :mapgroup google-docs docs.google.com
10:04  John-Galt: :map j -ex do-stuff
10:04  John-Galt: :mapgroup user
10:05  John-Galt: :map -group google-docs J -ex do-other-stuff
10:07  CIA-6: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 210eb812cacf7b906af94579b2f490aed6218b2e /common/content/mappings.js Add forgotten dequote call.
10:09  iaj: thanks man
10:09  iaj: so the docs.google.com is just the url or some kind of regexp?
10:13  John-Galt: If it starts with a ^ it's a regexp, otherwise it follows the same rules as stylesheet filters.
10:14  tlonim: is this the new key hive thing ?
10:21  John-Galt: Something to that effect.
10:23  iaj: mapgroup youtube ^http:\/\/www\.youtube\.(com|de)\/(watch|user) 
10:23  iaj: is that correct?
10:24  iaj: seems alike:)
10:27  John-Galt: You don't need to write \/. An ordinary / is good enough. But you need to quote it.
10:28  iaj: Ahhw.. ok.. thanks :)   could I map to an ex command pre-entered (not yet <CR>d) to the command line?
10:28  John-Galt: Huh?
10:29  iaj: -ex :fafa    would execute the :fafa already
10:30  iaj: I want to be on the command line with the line prefilled with something :D
10:30  John-Galt: So leave out the -ex.
10:34  iaj: How could I overwrite noremapped keys?
10:35  iaj: Hmmm my mapgroup is working globally on all pages
10:35  John-Galt: The same way as any other keys?
10:36  iaj: mapgroup youtube '^http:\\www\.youtube\.(com|de)\/(watch|user)'
10:36  iaj: . // srry
10:40  iaj: just www.youtube.com works.. mh well sufficient :)
10:43  John-Galt: Yeah, well, you'll just have to use :map -group for now.
10:44  iaj: Yup, fabulous job!
10:55  iaj: John-Galt: btw is there any way to trunchate long urls in the completion list?
10:56  John-Galt: Hm?
