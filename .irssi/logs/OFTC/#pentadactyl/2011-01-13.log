01:40  John-Galt: Someone got a cease and desist letter from the Facebook people for using the name FacePad for his extension.
01:41  John-Galt: Am I the only one who thinks lawyers should be taken out and shot, you know, for their own good?
01:44  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: they're operating for their own good though... you know, financially speaking
01:48 * John-Galt passes graffatcolmingov and irony pill.
02:16  John-Galt: Anyone feel like writing an add-on rejection message?
02:18  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: I was being sarcastic
02:18  John-Galt: Well, you weren't doing a very good job.

05:10  John-Galt: Weird... YouTube recommends I watch a video called "Understanding Teenage Girls". I can't imagine why anyone would even wish to attempt such a futile undertaking.
05:10 * John-Galt wonders if even teenage girls understand teenage girls and thinks not.

18:50  stepnem: Well, I don't remember what the answer is.
18:51  stepnem: John-Galt: Why have you also re-added ` to the local marks check?
18:51  John-Galt: Donno. It's supposed to be an alias for ', but I guess it's not.

18:56  heftig: John-Galt: 8ee051ecc520 (Add named groups) broke completion
18:57  John-Galt: Which completion?
18:58  heftig: :open completion, at least
18:58  John-Galt: Nope.
18:58  stepnem: Hm, there are some errors in the console, but everything seems to work here.
18:58  heftig: it only completes search keywords here, nothing else
18:58  John-Galt: Run with -purgecaches
19:00  stepnem: http://pastebin.com/f6KCpvi0
19:00  heftig: John-Galt: still broken
19:00  John-Galt: Ah, well, works for me.

19:02  heftig: that expected?
19:02  stepnem: That's the error I posted above.
19:03  John-Galt: When?
19:04  heftig: John-Galt: on hitting tab for completion
19:04  stepnem: John-Galt: Don't have to hit tab. Just 'o' is enough.
19:05  John-Galt: When did you post it, I mean?
19:05  stepnem: About 10 lines above ;-)

19:07  John-Galt: Weird.
19:07  John-Galt: Yeah, I get that too. Go figure.

19:16  John-Galt: People are too damned impatient, I swear.
19:16  heftig: sorry :)
19:17  stepnem: heftig: I think John-Galt was speaking about himself. ;-)
19:17  John-Galt: Both of us, for all the difference it makes.
19:25  tlonim: yeah. with pre10 i think dactyl didnt load at all.
19:26  tlonim: even slightly old snaps had issues
19:26  tlonim: i downgrade both firefox and dactyl 
19:26  tlonim: graded*
19:32  heftig: tlonim: which build are you using?
19:32  John-Galt: Donno. I'm on a nightly from yesterday, I think.
19:32  tlonim: heftig: i think it was one of your pkgbuild.com builds.. 
19:32  tlonim: so with latest ones it works ? may be i should try again
19:33  heftig: tlonim: nah, the newest build is the beta9-build
19:34  tlonim: heftig:  i think i used those
19:34  tlonim: building firefox is a pain when you have to build the xulrunner too :P
19:35  heftig: tlonim: dactyl nightly works with beta 9
19:35  tlonim: heftig: ok.. will check
19:36  heftig: tlonim: http://pkgbuild.com/dactyl
19:36  heftig: err
19:36  heftig: tlonim: http://pkgbuild.com/~heftig/dactyl
19:36  tlonim: i know the url..
19:36  John-Galt: You use a package for dactyl?
19:37  tlonim: heftig: i build from hg and do make -C with proxy addon thing
19:37  heftig: John-Galt: no, just the xpi
19:37  stepnem: O_o
19:51  John-Galt: Anyone care to provide me with a list of CSS keywords?
19:58  tlonim: so finally http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/01/13/1755240/Mozilla-To-Release-Firefox-4-Next-Month
20:00  John-Galt: Yeah, yeah. They've been saying that for ages now, though.
20:00  tlonim: they cleared all blockers i guess
20:00  John-Galt: Nope. I'm still subscribed to a few of them.
20:01  heftig: tlonim: 160 still remaining
20:01  heftig: took them 6 weeks to clear 100
20:01  tlonim: heftig: oh.. 
20:01  tlonim: 160 still ..hmm
20:01  tlonim: heftig: where do you see them ? 
20:01  tlonim: mozilla bugzilla ?
20:03  heftig: I guess
20:03  heftig: the number is from a mailing list announcement
20:03  tlonim: aha
20:04  John-Galt: Yeah, you can get a list of them from Bugzilla.
20:11  John-Galt: Oh, and 620486 is apparently about to be fixed. Finally.
20:13  heftig: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2.0:final
20:13  heftig: i think this is the list
20:15  tlonim: lot of gl bugs, is full gl rendering stable in linux ?
20:15  tlonim: last time I turned it on it froze browser
20:16  heftig: stable for me, but horribly slow
20:16  John-Galt: I didn't think they were even working on GL rendering for Linux.
20:16 * John-Galt wonders what's the point if it's horribly slow.
20:17  John-Galt: Isn't it meant to make rendering faster?
20:20  tlonim: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/09/hardware-acceleration/ 
20:20  tlonim: so on linux it uses xrender and opengl
20:20  tlonim: the xrender one is on by default
20:20  tlonim: but opengl one isnt..which is the buggy part
20:20 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 66a8cc01f669632258ad2b11dc9ca7997a633a13 /common/modules/ (styles.jsm template.jsm util.jsm) Add cheap CSS highlighting which is unfortunately far to slow to make any use of.
20:21  tlonim: and there is webgl too .. havent tested that much
20:22  heftig: they blacklisted all drivers except for the proprietary nvidia driver
20:22  tlonim: heftig: ah.yes..read that somewhere
20:22  tlonim: heftig: but you can overcome that blacklist with an environment variable
20:22  heftig: yes
20:22  heftig: works well enough fo google body
20:23  tlonim: heftig: what is the variable for full accel ? 
20:23  heftig: MOZ_ACCELERATED=1
20:24  tlonim: ah..got it .. layers.accelerate-all
20:24  tlonim: heftig: layers.accelerate-all has same effect as that MOZ_.. ?
20:24  heftig: maybe
20:25  tlonim: heftig: looks like it is 11
20:25  tlonim: MOZ_ACCELERATED=11
20:25  heftig: no, 1
20:25  tlonim: http://jagriffin.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/introducting-grafx-bot/ 
20:26  heftig: the code just checks for != 0
20:27  tlonim: ah.
20:27  tlonim: heftig: does firefox use cairo gl backend if present ?
20:27  heftig: nope
20:28  John-Galt: There is a Cairo version of Firefox, actually.
20:28  John-Galt: I'm fairly certain there is, anyway.
20:28  heftig: John-Galt: Firefox uses cairo by default
20:28  tlonim: by default firefox uses cairo-xlib backend
20:28  tlonim: but xcb backend too somehow if cairo has xcb
20:28  John-Galt: Hm... I'm fairly certain it uses GTK.
20:29  John-Galt: Yeah, appears to default to cairo-gtk2
20:29  tlonim: John-Galt: yeah..the cairo backend is referred to as cairo-gtk2 in mozconfig
20:29  tlonim: yes
