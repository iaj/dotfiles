00:27  iaj: someone up?
00:28  John-Galt: Nope
00:31  iaj: John-Galt: can you tell me whether theres a way to have hg repo linked to my extensions firefox profile folder?
00:32  iaj: for VIMP i had to create a textfile including the path to the repo
00:32  stepnem: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0lLUl1g-IY ;-)    
00:32  stepnem: iaj: it's the same with Dactyl
00:32  John-Galt: http://dactyl.sf.net/coding
00:33 * John-Galt almost wrote an auto-ban script for YouTube links after the bots yesterday...
00:34  iaj: stepnem: really?  i can just create a dactyl.org file in my extensions folder with the path?
00:34  iaj: I think I tried that and it didn't work out
00:35  stepnem: John-Galt: hm, I thought it was all some rar files
00:35  stepnem: iaj: see the link John-Galt posted
00:35  iaj: stepnem: Im looking at it... so I ahve to build the XPI?
00:36  stepnem: no you don't; it's the same as with Vimperator or any other similar extension
00:36  John-Galt: stepnem: Yeah, but I figured including YouTube links would be a safe addition.
00:36  iaj: I don't see the file into extensions folder entry there.. only the build XPI thing :/
00:37  stepnem: John-Galt: well, IMO any kind of such auto-banning sucks anyway
00:37  John-Galt: Nah, people can be unbanned, and YouTube links usually suck.
00:37  stepnem: it was no big deal compared to CIA spam after all ;-)
00:38  John-Galt: Eh, that's topical.
00:38  John-Galt: You can always /ignore it if you don't like it, anyway.
00:41  stepnem: well, I'm not going to be convinced auto-banning is a good idea; let's agree we disagree >_> (and I meant the occasional repeated avalanches, not normal commit notifications, obviously)
00:45  John-Galt: I was only kidding about YouTube anyway, but I was seriously considering banning anyone who mentions "psybnc" and a URL in the same message. Or anyone who posts a URL within about 2 seconds of joining.
00:46  John-Galt: But irssi's perl API is so atrocious that I just can't bring myself to do it.
00:48 * John-Galt goes back to sanding lead paint off of chair rails.
00:55  iaj: stepnem: I went to my Profile/extensions folder and created a file there... pentadactyl@dactyl.googlecode.com.xpi   with the contents ~/hg/dactyl/pentadactyl/   but its not working :(
00:56  Chousuke: don't use ~
00:56  stepnem: iaj: I'm not sure '~' works
00:56  iaj: it isn't ~  actually it is /Users/iaj/hg/dactyl/pentadactyl    i just shortcutted :)
00:57  stepnem: iaj: put a slash at the end
00:57  iaj: but still its not working :(   I don't need to fulfill the  'make -C pentadactyl xpi' path - correct?
00:57  iaj: stepnem: sec.
00:58  iaj: stepnem: I edit the file.. save.. but as soon as I reload firefox.. the file gets empty again
00:58  iaj: and no dactyl running within :\
00:59  stepnem: dunno; it might be a good idea to quit Firefox before editing the file
01:00  iaj: stepnem: i shouldn't have called the file (...).xpi :\
01:00  iaj: thanks for all your help guys
01:21  John-Galt: Well, if you call it *.xpi, Firefox treates it an an XPI, not as a proxy file.
01:22  John-Galt: At any rate, 'make install' generally does the job.
01:34  iaj: John-Galt: yeah I found out :) thanks
01:34  iaj: is it hard/possible to port vimp plugins to dactyl?
01:39  iaj: how would I be able to find out if it was called liberator.globalVariables in vimp, what it is like in dactyl?
01:40  stepnem: iaj: peruse the shiny new repository you cloned
01:41  iaj: stepnem: ok, and can you maybe tell me where I can obtain information about that 'option system' from dactyl?  is there some help on that one?
01:41  stepnem: iaj: I'm not sure what you mean
01:42  stepnem: iaj: there are :help pages and comments in the code
01:46  iaj: stepnem: im just crawling through the code, but which file is consisting of most of its source code??
01:48  stepnem: iaj: well, all of them mostly contain just source code; the names are generally quite straightforward -- if you're interested in options, options.js might be a good place to look at
01:55  iaj: stepnem: omg i didn't check the ../common folder :\
01:55  stepnem: heh
02:08  John-Galt: iaj: Just look at the official plugins. http://dactyl.sf.net/pentadactyl/plugins
02:12  iaj: John-Galt: hm, I can't make any use of those listed there... actually im looking for porting asdfghjkl.js and stella.js to be working in dactyl
02:12  John-Galt: I'm not saying to use them, I'm saying to look at the code.
02:12  iaj: John-Galt: oh you mean how those are implemented
02:19  John-Galt: Ugh. I just found out I'm having 4 more guests for Thanksgiving than I thought... That's two more main dishes and one more dessert to think up...
02:20  stepnem: Think up? Wouldn't just increasing quantity suffice?
02:20  John-Galt: No, I don't work that way.
02:21  stepnem: Ooohhh...!
02:21  John-Galt: Plus, you can't exactly fractionally increase the quantity of pies.
02:22 * stepnem wonders how many marriage proposals John-Galt gets per day
02:23  John-Galt: Heh. I'm not suited to long term relationships, even if I can cook.
02:24  iaj: :-)
02:33  John-Galt: Oh. My favorite brewery got a TV show...
02:33  John-Galt: I'd heard about it, but I had no idea it was Dogfish Head.
02:34  John-Galt: On the other hand, now I can't buy it anymore without looking trendy...
02:34  stepnem: LOL
02:38  iaj: can someone tell me if that's the correct way of adding options?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294854
02:39  iaj: because when I restart vimp and try  :verbose set asdfghjkl_default? theres nothing shown..
02:41  anon33_: Dogfish Head is on TV? really?
02:43  stepnem: iaj: looks fine and works for me
02:43  John-Galt: iaj: You want to use - rather than _. But otherwise it should work.
02:43  stepnem: (I hope you're really talking about Pentadactyl though)
02:44  John-Galt: Heh.
02:44  iaj: how an I print the output of asdfghjkl_default ( or rather - what does it have to show if its set to false ?)
02:45  John-Galt: anon33_: Yes. I was surprised too, especially since I had a glass of it in my hand when I found out.
02:45  John-Galt: iaj: :set asdfghjkl_default?
02:45  stepnem: iaj: it should show noasdfghjkl_default
02:46  iaj: thanks mates - what exactly is the purpose of the {} in there?
02:46  stepnem: you don't need it
02:46  stepnem: it's just for some more custom properties
02:46  iaj: if I drop it I get an error message.. I think
02:46  stepnem: you shouldn't
02:47  iaj: a syntax error - I had -_-
02:53  iaj: ok, tried to fix that plugin.. but somehow its not working as expected... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294862  someone knows why its not triggering the hints with numbers?
02:56 --- estragib is now known as Guest123
02:56 --- estragib_ is now known as estragib
03:11  John-Galt: iaj: Donno. Why don't you just use 'hintkeys'?
03:12  iaj: John-Galt: ohwell I like to use hintkeys with asdfjkl; but sometimes I feel of entering the hints name - faster if there are a lot of links :\
03:12  John-Galt: What does asdfhjkl.js do that 'hintkeys' doesn't?
03:12  iaj: John-Galt: when you press space you can enter hints label name.
03:13  John-Galt: You can already do that with \
03:13  iaj: can I remap that key to space?
03:13  John-Galt: Possibly.
03:13  John-Galt: But probably not without some hacks.
03:13  iaj: with \? uh... ? how do I enter that behaviour?
03:14  John-Galt: Well, you can if you set 'mapleader' to <Space>
03:14  iaj: just tried.. can you gimme an example?
03:14  John-Galt: And since 'mapleader' doesn't really serve any other purpose, you may as well.
03:14  iaj: ahhwhww.. thanks mate :)
03:15  John-Galt: Sure.
03:16  iaj: John-Galt: oh.. the only problem now.. if links get reduced, but there are still 2 left where you can choose from, you have to enter the fullname correct?
03:16  iaj: John-Galt: btw, do you use hintkeys - if y, what's your setting set to?
04:10  John-Galt: iaj: No, I just use numbers.
04:10  John-Galt: Anyway, you can press \ or <Space> or whatever you choose to toggle back, and you can also use <Tab> and <CR> to select.
06:06 * thesnowdog wonders if american bomb disposal robots are water proof
06:44  John-Galt: On the basis that that was probably facetious, I'm going to answer yes.
07:21  tlonim: when a tab is taking sometime to load, i cant switch the tab ... anyone experienced that ?
08:00  John-Galt: No.
08:02  John-Galt: There are times when I wish there were sleeping pills that didn't keep me awake.

08:28  John-Galt: :)
08:28 * John-Galt could do with 12 hours of sleep. I'll be lucky to get 6 all week.
08:29  John-Galt: But I'm going to have another go. Listening to Carl Sagan always seems to help, at least.

13:05  zhubosuiliu: where is focuscontent option in pentadactyl?
14:04  stepnem: zhubosuiliu: :h 'strictfocus
14:06  zhubosuiliu: stepnem, Thanks
14:17  remi: did anybody ever got this bug? Sometimes, all pentadactyl keyboard mappings (even :, <Esc> and <C-z>) gets disabled. the only way to get them working is to (gasp!) focus in any <input> or <textarea>. after that, all pentadactyl keys are working again.
14:18  remi: the thing is, I can't seem to figure out what I do just *before* everything stops working
14:19  stepnem: remi: http://code.google.com/p/dactyl/issues/detail?id=131
14:20  remi: oops, I thought I had searched for it
14:21  remi: anyway, I'll try to reproduce it, since it usually happens to me a few times per day
14:22  stepnem: remi: interesting; what version are you using?
14:22  remi: stepnem: latest version from the mercurial repo, on OSX
14:23  remi: Firefox 4.0b7
14:23  stepnem: It hasn't happened to me for a longish time, although it might as well be because I don't use the browser that much lately.

19:18  John-Galt: Has anyone else noticed that babies are fairly indiscriminant about where they puke?
19:19  j0su3: hi guys, i'm having some troubles with javascripts and pentadactyl, and i would like to know if the developers have made any changes in the javascript of Vimperator?
19:19  stepnem: John-Galt: of course; sounds like you haven't seen a lot of babies...
19:19  j0su3: some apps like GMail, Google Calendar and others that use a lot of javascript are affected
19:19  j0su3: *were affected
19:23  stepnem: j0su3: if what you mean is that some javascripty pages don't work as you'd like and you want to do something about it, :h 'strictfocus or :h 'passkeys might be of some interest
19:23  John-Galt: stepnem: Of course I have, I just don't normally have them in my house.
19:24  j0su3: stepnem, i tried passkeys it did not work very well
19:25  stepnem: John-Galt: yeah, s/seen/had a chance to observe for a prolonged period of time/ then...
19:25  j0su3: stepnem, i tried passkeys but it did not work very well
19:26  stepnem: j0su3: please try to be more specific
19:26  John-Galt: stepnem: I've done that, too. I'm just reaffirming my intention never to have any of my own.
19:26  stepnem: haha
19:26  j0su3: stepnem, ok i have litle problems using gmail and calendar
19:27  j0su3: and some big problems using fengoffice (http://www.fengoffice.com/web/)
19:28  j0su3: and http://www.mercadolivre.com.br/
19:28  j0su3: some sites that have javascript buttons or whatever
19:28  j0su3: don't work very well
19:29  j0su3: that mercadolivre is something like eBay
19:29  j0su3: and i could not use it with pentadactyl activated
19:30  stepnem: j0su3: what kind of problems?
19:30  j0su3: because the "buy button" did not appear in the interface
19:30  j0su3: some things like that
19:30  j0su3: my guess is some change in the way of treating javascript in firefox
19:31  j0su3: Vimperator does not have this kind of problem
19:31  j0su3: so, that's why i asked about that changes
19:31  stepnem: interesting
19:33  stepnem: I don't think Dactyl is supposed to be messing with content JavaScript; have you tried it with a clean profile, without other add-ons?
19:33  j0su3: yes
19:33  j0su3: and google chrome too
19:33  j0su3: stepnem, when i disable dactyl it works fine
19:33  j0su3: otherwise don 't
19:34  John-Galt: That would have nothing to do with Pentadactyl.
19:35  j0su3: humn...i really don't think so
19:36  j0su3: i use vimperator since 2009
19:36  John-Galt: We don't alter content pages at all.
19:37  John-Galt: You could try turning 'strictfocus' off, though.
19:37  j0su3: i started to use dactyl last week and then that problems started
19:38  j0su3: John-Galt, have you tried use dactyl with any app that uses ExtJS?

20:08  j0su3: humn...i will try that
20:10  haxley: hi
20:11  haxley: got a bug report but no google account and no intentions to create one
20:11  haxley: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.21362/abstract
20:12  haxley: take this page, enter foobar(or whatever) as username press tab to switch to the passwordfield and try entering  a password containing h,j,k  or l
20:13  haxley: (press hjkl will clear the password field and insert the pressed character)
20:13  stepnem: haxley: works for me
20:13  haxley: hmm ok
20:14  haxley: Mozilla Firefox 3.6.12, Copyright (c) 1998 - 2010 mozilla.org
20:14  haxley: Pentadactyl 1.0b3
20:15  haxley: for me its broken on virtually every page
20:15  haxley: works correct however if the field is selected manually
20:16  haxley: trying to disable the other plugins
20:16  haxley: nope
20:17  haxley: disabled everything besides pentadactyl
20:17  stepnem: right, the page is broken with 3.6.10 for me, too; I was testing with 4.0b7 first
20:18  haxley: i dont think its the fault of the page
20:18  haxley: (found the problem on some other page)
20:18  stepnem: I didn't mean to imply that ;-)
20:18  haxley: ok
20:18  haxley: sry
20:18  stepnem: thanks for the report
20:18  haxley: thanks for the quick fix i'd say
20:18  haxley: ^^
20:20  haxley: and some feature inspiration: 
20:20  stepnem: hm... 3.6.10 is pretty broken with Pentadactyl anyway it seems...
20:21  haxley: does anyone know dwb (http://bitbucket.org/portix/dwb/wiki/Home)?
20:21  haxley: i think they handle the download dialog in an awesome way
20:21  haxley: hmm guess its time to update^^
20:22  haxley: if your downloadings something, your asked where to save the file via the command line
20:22  haxley: which i would prefer over a new window
20:22  stepnem: (yeah, as you can see we don't really test that much with FF 3)
20:22  haxley: ^^
20:23  haxley: stepnem: is ff 4b allready stable enough?
20:24  stepnem: haxley: I don't know dwb, but I agree a CLI for downloading would be nice (same with :saveas); I think it will happen sooner or later
20:24  haxley: stepnem: awesome^^
20:24  stepnem: haxley: yeah, it's stable
20:31  haxley: stepnem: is ther some kind roadmap with upcoming festures?
20:32  stepnem: haxley: there's a TODO file in the repository
20:32  haxley: ah nice thx
20:32  stepnem: but it's not used that often...
20:33  haxley: ^^
20:42  stepnem: haxley: that's not to say the things listed in TODO (with a high priority) won't happen soon; some other features and refactorings are planned, too, also based on discussions here; right now it's mostly quick bug-fixes, main reason being AFAIK that the main developer is busy doing other things; feature suggestions are still welcome
20:42  haxley: nice
20:50  haxley: fuck
20:50  haxley: turned on all the plugins again
20:50  haxley: turned on vimperator, too
20:50  haxley: damn
20:51  haxley: not good
20:52  haxley: fuck
20:58  haxley: ok one can change the extension.ini in ones profile
20:59  haxley: and remove the vimperator extension

21:02  thesnowdog: fuck

21:02  thesnowdog: fuck
21:02  haxley: whats up?
21:02  thesnowdog: fuck
21:06  thesnowdog: haxley: You can just start with the -safemode flag and disable the extension whose name cannot be mentioned
21:07  haxley: hehe
21:07  haxley: that might have been easier indeed
21:12  John-Galt: Hm. Most of our nightly testers seem to use 3.6

22:50  stepnem: for the money, why not
22:50  stepnem: depends on the marital duties I'd have to perform
22:52  John-Galt: Eh, there are more important things than money. Perhaps if I were allowed a concubine...
