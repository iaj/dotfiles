02:03  John-Galt: Hm. The MIW is broken.
02:03  thesnowdog: Hm. The MOW is broken.
02:03  John-Galt: Is it?
02:03  thesnowdog: Presumably unknown MOW keys shouldn't fall through?
02:04  thesnowdog: i.e. you haven't intentionally changed its behaviour have you?
02:04  John-Galt: Donno. I had a hell of a time figuring out what that code was trying to do about unknown keys. But most of them were apparently supposed to close the MOW and then fall through. But I don't think I changed the behavior.
02:05  thesnowdog: Yeah, it's certainly changed.
02:06  John-Galt: Oh.
02:06  John-Galt: Apparently the Pentadactyl version of that script doesn't fuck up our help formatting any less than the Vimperator version.
02:07  thesnowdog: I'll look at it later I'm a bit frazzled.
02:07  John-Galt: Ok.
02:11  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I think I'm just talking rubbish so I'll shut up. *sigh*
02:13  John-Galt: Hm?
02:13  thesnowdog: Regarding the MOW.
02:13  John-Galt: Oh... ok.
02:14 * John-Galt is inclined to give this userstyle author a piece of his mind.
02:14  thesnowdog: I really don't hold up to lack of sleep at all anymore. It's clearly old age catching up with me.
02:14  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Only an inclination?
02:15  John-Galt: Aside from wrecking the formatting, he has the whole bloody thing in variable width fonts, including the code blocks and the default value blocks which rely on monospacing.
02:16  thesnowdog: Gays in the military?  But you'll be overrun by the Chinese tomorrow.  :(
02:16  John-Galt: We'll be overrun by the Chinese anyway.
02:17  thesnowdog: Oh, McCain opposed?
02:17  thesnowdog: Not if you nuke 'em first like our ex-PM requested.
02:18  thesnowdog: Err, politely suggested.

15:43 * John-Galt needs to add a FAQ about hidden search engines...
15:44  John-Galt: rogutes: Ah, thanks. That's what I get for reviving patches.
15:46  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 3363dbda501e5042bb4eb61c0f00a3bc8f363a1b /common/ (4 files in 2 dirs) Fix a typo in revision ae79abb4ff88.
16:29  rogutes: John-Galt: I keep hitting various problems with text finding (I second stepnem that 'finding' sounds strange here, but I am not a native speaker)
16:31  rogutes: E.g. ogoogle.com<CR>/go<CR><CR>Hn gives 'Pattern not found: go'
16:32  stepnem: rogutes: What's wrong with that?
16:33  rogutes: ...and sometimes I see 'finder.js: 302: TypeError: this.range is undefined' - not sure how to reproduce
16:33  rogutes: stepnem: with what? finding or 'pattern not found'?
16:33  stepnem: `n' searches for the next occurence of the last pattern
16:34  stepnem: ...which in this case is "go"
16:34  rogutes: stepnem: and n should stop working when navigating to another page?
16:34  stepnem: No.
16:35  stepnem: But "Pattern not found" shows that `n' works perfectly well.
16:35  rogutes: :) 
16:36  rogutes: Nope, it doesn't, because n is supposed to find the next match, and I see 'go' all over google.com, yet dactyl says 'not found'
16:37  stepnem: I see. That was the missing piece of the information...
16:37  stepnem: ;-)
16:37  rogutes: stepnem: I am slow at putting sentences together, so I wrote the vimish algorithm above to reproduce my problem...
16:39  stepnem: OK, I missed the double <CR>
16:39  rogutes: Yeah, I suppose algorithms are better left for computers :)
16:41  stepnem: Well, I can't reproduce the problem right now, but I think I did hit it in the past. And I did get the type error one just before moment.
16:43  stepnem: Hm... now teramako started porting dactyl fixes as well.
16:44  rogutes: The East didn't notice the fork?
16:44  stepnem: Well, obviously it did ;-)
16:48  rogutes: Here are the 2 /finding related errors I see most: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=P704wApU
16:52  rogutes: stepnem: Then the question of morality perhaps? I.e. they kept seeing Martin as the good guy?
16:54  stepnem: rogutes: I really have no idea what's going on in their heads.
16:54  stepnem: Only a very skewed notion of "morality" could keep anyone with Vimp as opposed to Penta as far as I can tell.
16:58  rogutes: I doubt that the community understood what was going on.
16:59  rogutes: One had to look at the commit history to understand that Martin only talks much, but most users come from addons@mozilla or the nightlies, neither of which carry the history.
17:00  stepnem: Sure, I thought you were talking about devs like teramako.
17:10  rogutes: Yeah, this doesn't really apply to the devs, sorry for the confusion {it must be some Japanese honor then...but I shut up}.

22:20 * thesnowdog receives a "Happy Holidays" card from the US...ugh!
22:20  thesnowdog: stepnem: You seem rather irked by this state of affairs.
22:22 * thesnowdog answers the door first thing in the morning to realise that the annoying tapping noise through the night was actually a stalker sleeping at the wrong door
22:22 * thesnowdog directs stalker to hot chick one door up - that girl is trouble
22:24 * thesnowdog is clearly a wannabe tweeter
22:25  thesnowdog: stepnem: KeySnail might be of some interest but I haven't investigated: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13118/
