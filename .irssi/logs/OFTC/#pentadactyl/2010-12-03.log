16:55  stepnem: Symmetry: there's not, and it sucks big time
17:06  stepnem: LOL, it only took Google Groups about a day to display my message posted through Gmane. How kind of them!
18:19  John-Galt: stepnem: It got caught by the spam filter.
18:19  John-Galt: I just got the spam report, so I s'pose someone else approved it.
18:19  stepnem: well, I'm not sure what difference that makes
18:20  John-Galt: Ok.
18:20  stepnem: I've had Gmane messages dropped by GG in the past, too.
18:21  stepnem: Now I've just set up my client to post to the ML address directly.
18:22  John-Galt: Probably because it's a common source of spam.
18:22  stepnem: Gmane? I seriously doubt that.
18:22  John-Galt: I don't.
18:24  stepnem: Well, I do. I've seen spam in multiple GG groups that I haven't seen in other Gmane groups, from which I tend conclude that the spam does not come through Gmane.
18:25  stepnem: I also don't see why spammers would go to the pain of Gmane authorization.
18:25  stepnem: s/to/through/
18:27  stepnem: Generally its spam from outside that gets to Gmane and is filtered there, not the other way round.
18:31  John-Galt: Possibly. At any rate gmane hasn't confirmed its sender address, which I'd imagine weighs heavily against it in the classifier.
18:33  stepnem: Why should it have to confirm the sender address? Can't anyone post to the list?
18:34  stepnem: Or do you mean asking the Gmande SMTP server if it knows the address?
18:35  stepnem: In any case, as I mentioned previously, I've only ever had this problem with Google Groups.
18:36  stepnem: (and have seen others reporting the same)
18:36  John-Galt: True, but non-members are also weighed against in the classifier.

21:00  thesnowdog: John-Galt: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591425
21:03  John-Galt: Interesting. I missed that one.
21:05  John-Galt: Hm. teramako's commented on it, too.
21:12  thesnowdog: Someone should follow that 'other' project.
21:12 * thesnowdog suffers the indignity
21:12  John-Galt: Not I.
21:12  thesnowdog: Well you were why stop?
21:13  John-Galt: No I wasn't, I checked the commit log once or twice in the weeks before I released dactyl.
21:14  thesnowdog: No, you pointed to Teramako's recent commit to prove he was with the 'others'.
21:15  John-Galt: Did I? When?
21:15  thesnowdog: ...among other things.
21:15  thesnowdog: When you were complaining about "not getting" why they were with 'them'.
21:15  John-Galt: Nope, I just have his twitter account piped through babelfish to my RSS reader. I scan that occasionally.
21:15 * thesnowdog thinks John-Galt is losing it
21:15  John-Galt: That's about as close to following Vimperator as I get.
21:17  thesnowdog: Well I wasn't following it and used to get all my updates here. I think it's silly not to so I will very loosely follow it.
21:17  thesnowdog: anekos and teramako fix bugs
21:17  thesnowdog: Of course, theres too much divergence now probably.
21:18  John-Galt: This is true. If you want to follow it, be my guest, but I don't have the temperment for it.
21:19  thesnowdog: Well it's a lot easier than following you. ;-)
21:22 --- josue is now known as j0su3
21:23  John-Galt: Well, at any rate, I'd prefer to avoid the influence. As far as I'm concerned, Vimperator and Pentadactyl are two different projects now, and I'd prefer not to keep them artificially similar.
21:23  John-Galt: But if someone spots a useful bug fix that I wouldn't have thought of, it'd be nice to know about it.
21:24  John-Galt: Damnit. Panorama is still completely fscked in my test profile no matter which Minefield I use.
21:26  thesnowdog: Of course, I wasn't planning on 'porting' features... :S
21:26  John-Galt: I'd just rather not know about them.
21:26  thesnowdog: On driving fatalities: "The most skilled are the most killed". :(
21:26  John-Galt: Ideas are insidious.
21:27  thesnowdog: I'll try and resist...
21:28 * thesnowdog spends more time talking about following Vimperator bug fixes than actually doing so

22:59  John-Galt: Why would we want to search the MOW?
23:00  stepnem: o_O
23:00  John-Galt: At any rate, MOW mode is currently one of those appalling hacks that I've sadly put off fixing until 1.0 is released. :(
23:01  stepnem: yeah, there are other problems with it anyway
23:02  John-Galt: Anyone feel like adding 'hintkeys' to the FAQ including :hi -a Hint text-transform: uppercase; ?
23:03  John-Galt: There was something else I was meaning to add, too... someone just asked it again.
23:03 +CIA-8: Doug Kearns <dougkearns@gmail.com> * 2b8ecc59716290b8dc9474dc8826c3908abefc26 / (common/content/options.js pentadactyl/TODO) Allow signed numeric values in :set!. (anekos)
23:04  thesnowdog: stepnem is my nominated FAQ man
23:04  stepnem: John-Galt: I'll see what I can do
23:04  John-Galt: It might have been 00:06 < John-Galt> :set! browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false
23:04  John-Galt: stepnem: Thanks.
23:06  stepnem: John-Galt: it's not so much about "thinking up" one's own as about the fact that typing the file name manually is a PITA; BTW with that commit I get desktop-menu.el.asc instead of desktop-menu.el for http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/desktop-menu.el
23:07  stepnem: (but it's a huge improvement anyway)
23:07  John-Galt: .asc? Hm.
23:08  John-Galt: I suppose .asc == .txt in some alternate universe or something.
23:11  stepnem: John-Galt: Do you have the hintkeys question somewhere for reference? I don't remember anyone actually asking that (the uppercase part).
23:11  John-Galt: Hold on.
23:11  stepnem: Or I guess I do, but not quite who and where.
23:13  John-Galt: 11:54 < aksr> John-Galt, is it possible, when you use letters as "hintkeys" , to make them "look" like big letters(ex. "A"), but to type "a" ?
23:13  John-Galt: There are others. Hold on.
23:14  John-Galt: 22:10 < anon33_> Would it be possible to have hintkeys display as capital letters on the home row but accept lower-case letters?
23:14  thesnowdog: John-Galt: It's early so I'm easily amused but I liked the last line in this: http://userstyles.org/styles/40707
23:14  thesnowdog: ...more beautiful indeed.
23:15  stepnem: John-Galt: thanks; I guess I'll have to actually try it to get what's really going on anyway.
23:16  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Heh.
23:16  John-Galt: I'm more than a little amused that they bothered to write a stylish stylesheet rather than just using :highlight.
23:17 * John-Galt wonders just what that stylesheet does, so loads it into :style...
23:18  stepnem: I don't see anything but the comment on that page. I must be missing something.
23:18  stepnem: ah, JavaScript
23:18  John-Galt: You have to enable JS and press show code.
23:18  John-Galt: Lame, yeah.
23:19  John-Galt: Oh, god. Not more beautiful.
23:19  John-Galt: At any rate, it breaks our formatting.
23:23 * John-Galt wonders what MS's reaction to the hiding of the ads will be.
23:27  thesnowdog: WTH are facemoods
23:28  John-Galt: ???
23:29  thesnowdog: Ugh, what has that got to do with Stylish. "The recommended way to install user styles is to use Stylish. Install Stylish with Facemoods for Firefox,"
23:29  thesnowdog: Facebook chat emoticons or something
23:29  John-Galt: I... see... No, I don't.
23:31 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 7733b9bf49538b7eb779358b73343aca7339e6ff / (4 files in 3 dirs) Fix :viu!.
23:31  John-Galt: I've been meaning to add some method of importing user stylesheets into :sty automatically.
23:31  John-Galt: Should really do that.
23:38  thesnowdog: Oh god, it's raining again. The rainiest spring and now summer on record on the driest continent on earth.
23:39 * thesnowdog waits for the Antarctica correction
23:39  John-Galt: Define dreary.
23:39  thesnowdog: So, what do we do, we lift water restrictions that have no real effect on peoples lives anyway because droughts are now a thing of the past. AHHHHH!
23:40  thesnowdog: Could be worse, could be -20 in Scotland I guess.
23:40 * John-Galt doesn't mind -20
23:41  thesnowdog: Not sure I've ever been -20 sans wind chill.  I think the coldest at our place was about -15
23:41  John-Galt: C or F?
23:42  thesnowdog: One nice aspect of the current conditions is that the Poms are whining about crossing the globe for English weather.
23:42  thesnowdog: C of course
23:43  thesnowdog: People still use F?
23:43  John-Galt: Yes. We still use feet, inches, teaspoons, etc even, in the US. The UK officially uses C, but people in practice only use C in when it's cold and F when it's hot.
23:44  John-Galt: Go figure.
23:45  thesnowdog: Sheesh, Philadelphia is cold.  I thought it was just for Rocky.
23:45  thesnowdog: ...according to Wiki
23:48  thesnowdog: Record Aus low is apparently -23 C on the day I was remembering in '94 but we're a bit lower than the measuring station at Charlottes Pass.
23:48 * thesnowdog is ashamed by that poor effort we must do better.
23:49  John-Galt: Heh.
23:53  thesnowdog: Hmm, the forcast is for rain on every day in December. Bizarre...
23:53  thesnowdog: Australians melt in the rain.
23:54  thesnowdog: The sicko factor has gone through the roof apparently.
23:54  thesnowdog: *sicky
23:55 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * d20ebb4420fc0af65dde69c32f077108d2c0d4e4 /common/content/options.js Do away with silly and troublesome regexp entirely from Doug's/anekos' last commit.
23:55  John-Galt: Heh... I was wondering about that before I read the correction.
23:56  thesnowdog: Does sicky or sickie translate?
23:56  John-Galt: Possibly...
23:57  thesnowdog: It's slang for a feigned illness induced day off work. 
23:58  John-Galt: Ah, yeah, in context, but I think we'd say 'playing hookie'.
23:59  John-Galt: I'm more like to say skiving off, but I think that's because I read british books.
