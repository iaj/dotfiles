02:16  Symmetry: Is anyone aware of an IRC client that works with keybindings, like vim/links/mutt/PD?
02:16  stepnem: Symmetry: Emacs
02:17  Symmetry: I'd rather not use emacs if possible...
02:17  stepnem: another masochist...
02:17  John-Galt: Symmetry: There's a Vim IRC client on vim.org
02:17 * stepnem throws up his hands
02:17  Symmetry: John-Galt: aha, awesome
02:17  Symmetry: stepnem: consider the IRC channel you're on
02:18  stepnem: well, Emacs is as pentadactyly as it gets, if you ask me
02:19  stepnem: it's not perfect, but I know nothing better (same with Pentadactyl, although that's not the point I was trying to making)
02:19  stepnem: s/making/make/
02:19  Symmetry: vim's much more pentadactyl than emacs, considering PD is a fork of vimperator
02:20  stepnem: Well, I'm not going to have that discussion. Each to their own.
02:20  John-Galt: It's not a fork.
02:20  John-Galt: Or, perhaps, they're both forks of what came before. One isn't a fork of the other.
02:20  Symmetry: Oh, I thought it was, my apologies
02:21  Symmetry: what came before? Are you referring to vim?
02:21  stepnem: Symmetry: well, it's described as fork on it's GC page AFAIK, so, no need to apologise ;-)
02:22  John-Galt: Well, the way I see it, the people who were working on Vimperator before are now working on Pentadactyl. The main force of the development has moved this way, so it seems silly to say Pentadactyl is a fork of Vimperator.
02:23  stepnem: (The way I see it, Pentadactyl is a natural continuation of Vimperator, unlike the current Vimperator.)
02:23  Symmetry: I've heard many things about current vimperator, most of them negative. What's wrong with it?
02:23  stepnem: Symmetry: why don't you try and see for yourself?
02:23  Symmetry: I have no earlier version to compare against
02:25  stepnem: Symmetry: Have you read the "Vimperator 3.0 and beyond" goals wiki page?
02:26  Symmetry: No, I'll take a look though
02:26  stepnem: (And I'm not sure you need to compare it to earlier versions. I tried Vimp about three times in last two months, one time it didn't work at all, and the other two times it looked pretty broken.)

14:03  iaj: Hmm I got a question - what may the problem be if hints are shown differently - like adapting to the page's layout on certain pages?
14:05  John-Galt: ?
14:06  addikt1ve: I don't get it iaj 
14:09  iaj: well on some pages f renders hints differenlty - than on others
14:10  addikt1ve: oh you mean, hints background etc. ?
14:10  addikt1ve: well I think it's not a bug it's a feature :)
14:10  iaj: mhhh :-S
14:16  John-Galt: I don't understand it. In the NY Times most recent book list they feature a book on Mahler, but the review they feature is mostly negative...
14:17  John-Galt: addikt1ve: No, it's a bug.
14:17  John-Galt: iaj: Which pages?
14:17  addikt1ve: *fail*
14:19  iaj: http://www.wer-kennt-wen.de/ for example John-Galt hints are displayed sooo large..  but I guess I could narrow it down with firebug
14:19  iaj: theres a * {   in the css which overwrites my hint's font-size setting
14:19  John-Galt: Are they? They look normal to me.
14:23  iaj: John-Galt: hmm must be some setting of mine then :\
14:23  iaj: John-Galt: is there a way to disable the ": checkbox_text" on Hints?
14:25  addikt1ve: yes they actually look bigger than normal to me
14:25  John-Galt: No.
14:35  iaj: John-Galt: do you use the basic theme - or some modications to the hints?
14:38  John-Galt: I don't change any styles, no.
14:42  stepnem: John-Galt: no preference
14:47  iaj: John-Galt: woah.. aren't those basic hints hardly readable?
14:48  John-Galt: No.
14:53  stepnem: A reproducible bug: on the :help pages, after going forward/backward in history, I have to reload the page to get it to display. 
14:53  stepnem: The page is blank and obviously in some kind of weird state, e.g. the right-click menu doesn't even pop up either.
14:54  iaj: John-Galt: well for me the fonts on www.wer-kennt.wen.de are bigger than usual - the hint fonts :(
14:54  stepnem: After some time, all keys stop working, so I have to close the tab with mouse.
14:55  John-Galt: stepnem: Yeah, I know. Well, not the blank part. Hadn't seen that.
14:56  iaj: John-Galt: we talked about the PASSTHROUGH issue yesterday - is there a way to have certain keys PASSTHROUGH'ed but some now?
14:56  iaj: s/now/not
14:57  stepnem: For me it's 100% reproducible (with +u NONE and all). If I don't reload the page in a few seconds, after going forward/backward, it remains blank and unresponsive.
14:58  stepnem: iaj: :h 'passkeys
14:59  iaj: Awesome thanks
14:59  stepnem: Clicking on the status/command line gets it back, though.
14:59  John-Galt: Yeah, that's not entirely surprising. The hack collapses the browser element while it's loading. There're probably some corner cases where it's never uncollapsed.
14:59  John-Galt: I suppose I should transfer the focus beforehand to fix the focus issues.
15:01  iaj: Woah.. 'passkeys is awesome.. thanks so much for that whole project!
15:02  John-Galt: I suppose I should just always uncollapse on LocationChange for the cases where it's collapsed but the page changes before PageLoad.
15:03  iaj: Ahhh another thing - can I somehow view the current source in 'editor setting?
15:03  stepnem: gF
15:09  iaj: ty!
15:19  iaj: I know a ;f setting from vimperator.. so in dactyl to get the same behaviour (being able to select multiple links) I'd have to g;b correct?
15:21  John-Galt: If you mean ;F, then yes.
15:21  John-Galt: Although it's not the same behavior because it's somewhat faster.
15:22  stepnem: Ugh, total lock-up at last, not even clicking anywhere helps. "TypeError: e is null, buffer.js l. 1158"
15:23  iaj: John-Galt: It really is :-)
15:23  iaj: John-Galt: yeah ;F forgive me
15:23  John-Galt: There is no 'e' on that line...
15:24  stepnem: http://pastebin.com/6Cje8nkN
15:25  stepnem: (actually FF keys did work then, just the Dactyl ones not)
15:26  John-Galt: Weird. There's still no 'e' on that line.
15:28  iaj: Hmm, is there any setting for turning off 'more information about hints'  - eg. just show numbers?
15:29  John-Galt: NO.
15:30  iaj: Thanks :-)
15:31  stepnem: set nohintscrap
15:31  John-Galt: No, if anything :set hintinputs=''
15:35  iaj: heh:)
15:35  stepnem: lulz; now dactyl keys again suddenly stopped working just in the middle of scrolling a help page using j
15:36  stepnem: That's a real mystery. One would say something must trigger that? The page already loaded and worked fine for a minute or so...
15:38  John-Galt: I think it's unrelated.
15:40  stepnem: Well related or not, it's as weird as it can get.
15:40 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 0aeff10e387d8668bc44b47a1c5faf201fa9882a /common/ (4 files in 2 dirs) Isolate hint nodes from page styles.
15:40  John-Galt: People have complained about it before. j on help pages. But it's never happened to me.
15:40  stepnem: Some cosmic radiation I guess.
15:41  stepnem: John-Galt: I happened to me on other pages, too.
15:43  stepnem: The thing is that it happens just like that, without anything remotly plausible as a trigger. Everything works, you just scroll a page you have loaded for some time, and suddenly you don't scroll a page.
15:47  stepnem: A real wizard, that John-Galt.
15:48  John-Galt: >:-|
16:42  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I'd be happy enought with :yank working like :time sure.
16:42 * thesnowdog confirms that expensive ear plugs were worth the outlay
16:43  thesnowdog: Perhaps even books on Mahler are simply impervious to bad reviews?
16:45  thesnowdog: John-Galt will always be my wizard.
16:48  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Perhaps, except that bad reviews don't generally serve as a good basis for recommendation. Especially when said review is published by the same rag as said recommendation.
17:08  peth: can i find out which profile fx is running? i'd like to set 'titlestring' accordingly and have my wm automatically apply a tag.
17:10  peth: or maybe there's a better way?
18:09  peth: never mind, found $PENTADACTYL_INIT :/
18:42  blueyed: Hi. Is it possible to use an option that was added by a plugin in your pentadactylrc file already?
18:42  blueyed: I think it's supposed to work, but says "unknown option"
18:43 * blueyed is just assuming it should work, but I do not know if it has regressed.
19:01  John-Galt: blueyed: :loadplugins
19:02  blueyed: John-Galt: do you mean I should add "loadplugins" to my rc, before using the option?
19:03  blueyed: at least it works. Thanks!
19:08  John-Galt: Yes.
