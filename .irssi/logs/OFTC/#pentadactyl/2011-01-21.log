19:21  stepnem: John-Galt, Monkey: Let's close issue 23. It makes no sense. The matches are already clickable and hintable where possible. You can't use hints and type an URL filter at the same time, understandably.

20:41  quesada: hi, is there a good solution for getting the j/k scroll as smooth as 'yet another smooth scroll'?
20:42  quesada: I tried https://github.com/vimpr/vimperator-plugins/blob/master/_smooziee.js but I don't see any difference

21:07  stepnem: John-Galt, Monkey: Let's close issue 269, too. I don't use sidebars, but I don't find the alternative :sidebar suggestions persuasive (the person didn't even notice :sbclose reading :h :sidebar).
21:07 +eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/269 ---, New, Enhancement, Medium, :sidebar! could open/close the sidebar
21:15  milant: stepnem: i saw the sidebar req earlier too, i remember i was looking for something similar at the time. it would seem easier to have a simple default :sidebar and :sidebar! boolean toggle
21:16  stepnem: !@#$$*)
21:24  milant: :P
21:24  milant: it felt like the natural thing to look for. i have a feeling it'll be a frequently made request.
21:26  milant: stepnem: :sidebar has no utility for me either, but it was one of the first things i grokked for in the beginning 
21:27  stepnem: milant: It's not like you can't define your own command in terms of :sidebar and :sbclose.
21:28  milant: stepnem: right. NOW i know. but in the beginning i wasn't familiar in terms of the vim conventions.
21:28  milant: stepnem: i'm indifferent really. just saying that u might get others making the same request.
21:28  stepnem: You should make yourself familiar before requesting features based on your unfamiliarity.
21:29  stepnem: As I said, the guy didn't even notice :sbclose at all.
21:29  milant: stepnem: ya, i didn't make it. :P
21:30  milant: stepnem: in general, if it FEELS like a boolean command, i think the default action should be :cmd and :cmd! with everything else optional whipped cream and cherries 
21:32  stepnem: Well, we can just make :sidebar! do the same as :sbclose.
21:32  stepnem: Wouldn't hurt I guess.
21:33  milant: stepnem: i had the same problem earlier today with the "Zoom Text Only" command where i had a hard time finding it because they were receiving values rather than being a straightfoward :set! zoomTextOnly that matched the menu state and functionality.
21:33  milant: stepnem: but in that case it's more a documentation issue. i couldn't find it in my search
21:34  stepnem: milant: What documentation issue? :h zoom
21:35  milant: stepnem: exactly. i associated that with "zoom in" and zoom out", and i was looking for "zoom text only" and its permutations
21:36  stepnem: Come on. The documentation specifically says "text zoom" as opposed to "full zoom"
21:37  milant: stepnem: like i said, in the ffox menu it's a boolean, yet in the docs it's a hybridized continuous value. but really, all that was needed was something beside the cmd that mentioned "zoom text only".
21:37  milant: stepnem: ya, it's obvious after. but i was skimming thru looking for the actual text,. not doing a close reading. it happens. :(
21:38  stepnem: I think what is needed is that you start thinking a bit about what you read instead of sticking to your assumptions about everything.
21:42  milant: stepnem: ha. no i'm just playing devil's advocate here, trying to show what it looks like from an outsider's perspective who isn't familiar with the internals all that much.
21:44  milant: stepnem: it's not a big deal, really. i'm just saying there's a couple small things that we could do to minimize the learning curve. you guys have been VERY helpful to me. and i'd like to repay it towards future users and minimize the main points of friction that i went thru. just sharing some insight, that's all.
22:25  stepnem: Ugh, that noscript plugin really gives people headaches, doesn't it... :-P
23:51  quesada: hmm... you are on hacker news : http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2127209
23:51  quesada: congrats
