01:23 * John-Galt needs a book.
01:39  Symmetry: Fiction or nonfiction?
01:56  John-Galt: Fiction. I have nonfiction.
01:59  Symmetry: I suggest Michael Moorcock's Elric saga
01:59  Symmetry: Assuming you read fantasy
02:00  Symmetry: I don't read a lot of fiction books that aren't fantasy/scifi, but one I have read recently and enjoyed was The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. not a great novel, but not bad, and certainly better than most of the trash out there
02:12 --- peth is now known as Guest659
02:12 --- peth_ is now known as peth
02:29  heftig: last books i read were the temeraire series
02:29  heftig: i enjoyed those
03:00  iaj: is there some easy way to reach (via commandline) the most recent added bookmarks somehow?
03:15  heftig: hmm, tab completion was broken by recent trunk, not sure what caused it

03:49  John-Galt: heftig: The tracemonkey devs caused it.
03:50  John-Galt: iaj: Not easily, no.
03:51  iaj: Hmm, ok, thanks once again.
05:48 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 6f53441948cdb9d8ffeaa8b9fad0e15426574f2b /common/content/buffer.js Fix issues with help rendering hack.
06:00  John-Galt: Hm. Just found out that some assholes made a sequel to Donnie Darko.
06:00  John-Galt: I really don't think that there's a harsh enough punishment for the makers of unplanned sequels.
07:01  tlonim: John-Galt: lol.. 
07:01  tlonim: but the sequel is not made by original people
07:02  tlonim: but it sucks a lot
07:13  realfiona: command complete in the nightly build version is broken?? 
07:18  John-Galt: realfiona: In Minefield it is, but Minefield is called Minefield for a reason.
09:42  addikt1ve: hi :)
09:42  addikt1ve: I'm looking for a delicious plugin for pentadactyl; the one I'm using is deprecated (uses liberator instead of dactyl) and doesn't allow me to provide tags
09:44  stepnem: addikt1ve: You can just use the Vimperator one by Nikolai Weibull
09:44  stepnem: s/liberator/dactyl/ and you're good to go
09:45  Symmetry: I managed to get everything working properly in b7, by the way, and even as heavily extended as I keep my firefox it's very, very fast
09:45  Symmetry: And that's impressive on my terrible P4 machine
09:45  addikt1ve: Symmetry: same here, but Atom N280
09:45  addikt1ve: stepnem: great, I'm doing that
09:46  John-Galt: Hm... I'm out of touch with Intel chip development.
09:47  addikt1ve: stepnem: mmh, what about tags?
09:47  Symmetry: N280 is two generations of netbooks' "standard" processor
09:47  stepnem: addikt1ve: it completes the tags suggested by Delicious
09:47  Symmetry: one generation ago it was N450, and currently N550/D525 are taking over
09:48  Symmetry: anyway I've tried to use vimp plugins that copy data to the clipboard - like URL shortening ones - and it says something about not being able to use the clipboard function. Is there a way to fix that with some code replacement?
09:48  stepnem: Symmetry: use dactyl.clibpoard{Read,Write}
09:48  addikt1ve: oh you just add tags in the commandline
09:48  addikt1ve: great
09:48  addikt1ve: \Å“/
09:48  addikt1ve: thanks
09:48  Symmetry: oh, what was it, vimperator.clipboard(Read,Write)?
09:49  stepnem: no, util.readFromClipboard or something
09:49  Symmetry: ah
09:50  Symmetry: mind if I pass you the URL to the plugin I'm wanting to use and you either pastebin the modified one or tell me exactly where to modify it? I'm completely inexperienced with this sort of thing and it frightens me
09:50  stepnem: you have to overcome your fear, you know ;-)
09:51 * stepnem just watched Donnie Darko ... Yankees are fatalistic crackpots
09:54  Symmetry: http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/attachmentText?id=262&aid=-8709123689944909220&name=goo_gl.js&token=c54d065eef7e68809c67b47bee0d1045 which bit exactly do I change to dactyl.clipboard(Read,Write) ?
09:55  stepnem: Symmetry: util.copyToClipboard
09:56  Symmetry: And do I also add the parentheses, replace parentheses, or leave that alone?
09:56  stepnem: leave them alone
09:57  Symmetry: hmm, it's not picking up the command as existing after :loadplugins
09:58  Symmetry: oh wait, I put it in the wrong folder
09:59  Symmetry: and it's still not picking it up
10:05  stepnem: Symmetry: wrap the "gg" inside square brackets
10:05  Symmetry: so :[gg] in the js file?
10:05 * John-Galt considers kicking stepnem for his slight on Donnie Darko
10:05  stepnem: Symmetry: nope, in the addUserCommands call
10:06  John-Galt: Although the scenes that bring up god make me twitch, I'll admit.
10:06  Symmetry: I don't know what that is
10:06  stepnem: John-Galt: good, let's move this channel to EFNet or somewhere more appropriate then ;-)
10:06  John-Galt: Hm. I don't think I could take the flashbacks. I haven't been on EFNet for at least 15 years.
10:07  stepnem: Symmetry: well, there is only one line that has "addUserCommands" and "gg", right?
10:08  Symmetry: ah, I was searching for commands, not command
10:08  tlonim: Donnie Darko is awesome
10:08  Symmetry: so "[gg]" or [gg]?
10:08  stepnem: Symmetry: sorry
10:08  tlonim: creepy to its fullest
10:08  stepnem: Symmetry: ["gg"]
10:08  tlonim: stepnem: which cut did you watch ?
10:08  tlonim: Director's Cut?
10:09  stepnem: tlonim: yep
10:09  tlonim: i see
10:09  Symmetry: "Not a pentadactyl command: gg" same as before
10:09  tlonim: in terms of Cuts the most fragmentation i hacve seen is for Blade Runner
10:09  tlonim: it has like 10-15 cuts
10:09  John-Galt: Plus it has Jena Malone, which is really enough on its own.
10:09  stepnem: Symmetry: works for me
10:09  Symmetry: hmm
10:09  tlonim: John-Galt: ++ 
10:09  tlonim: :)
10:10  Symmetry: mind pastebinning it so I can compare?
10:11  stepnem: Symmetry: http://pastebin.com/h3yEXY0u
10:11  addikt1ve: mmh
10:11  addikt1ve: how can I add a search engine?
10:11  addikt1ve: i.e. youtub
10:11  addikt1ve: e
10:11  stepnem: :h :bmark
10:11  stepnem: :dia searchengines
10:11  tlonim: music in DD is what i liked most
10:12  Symmetry: hmm, mine is the exact same, it's still not working though
10:12  John-Galt: addikt1ve: :h ;S or mycroft.com if you prefer.
10:12  Symmetry: it probably will after a fx restart, oh well
10:12  John-Galt: Or addons.mozilla.org, even.
10:13  John-Galt: Yeah, it has an unusually good soundtrack.
10:13  addikt1ve: you have to use an addon to add a search engine oO ?
10:13  stepnem: mycroft.com 0_0
10:14  Symmetry: oh dear :h loads a blank page after flashing a block of text
10:14  John-Galt: Oh, er, mycroft.mozdev.org
10:14  John-Galt: I always get that wrong.
10:14  John-Galt: :)
10:15  John-Galt: Symmetry: That's what you get for using Panorama.
10:15  Symmetry: Panorama?
10:15  John-Galt: Damn it, we need a FAQ bot.
10:15 * John-Galt writes a FAQ bot...
10:16  John-Galt: Symmetry: they call it "Tab Groups", and sometimes "Tab View" or "Tab Candy", but it's officially "Panorama" these days.
10:16  Symmetry: Oh, that
10:16  Symmetry: I don't even use it
10:16  Symmetry: is there a way to turn it off?
10:16  John-Galt: Well, activating it once breaks help pages for the session.
10:17  Symmetry: I don't think I have, but I might've accidentally
10:17  addikt1ve: \o/
10:17  Symmetry: while trying to do something more useful, perhaps
10:18  John-Galt: Probably. It's hard not to accidentally activate it occasionally. Especially if you turn methodjit on for chrome, which breaks things rather badly.
10:47  addikt1ve: mmh
10:47  addikt1ve: the delicious script keeps asking for my password
10:47  addikt1ve: :/
10:51  stepnem: addikt1ve: dunno; when I used it, it always only asked the first time in a session
10:51  addikt1ve: stepnem: mmh I may have restarted firefox, you're right
11:42  John-Galt: Blech. I have to write another release anouncement. I need to get myself a monkey to do these things for me.
11:43  addikt1ve: haha
12:03  thesnowdog: Donnie Darko is slightly less overrated than Mahler
12:16  Symmetry: I don't know that I'd agree with Mahler being overrated
12:16  Symmetry: assuming you speak of the composer
12:26  thesnowdog: Symmetry: you shall be very popular around here
12:26  Symmetry: Being sarcastic, or sincere?
12:28  thesnowdog: John-Galt often exits this channel to indulge in some Mahler
12:28  Symmetry: Ah
12:29  Symmetry: well, I'm a professional musician and professor, and Mahler's music was one of the things that drove me to choose this career
12:29  Symmetry: So yes, I do love Mahler.
12:46  thesnowdog: Interesting.  It's just never done much for me in the distant past - such is music.
12:46  thesnowdog: Symmetry: And Donnie Darko? ;-)
12:46  Symmetry: Not a fan, but I don't really like movies in general
12:50  Symmetry: the last one I can remember enjoying is The Last Unicorn, which is one of my favorite works of media ever
12:50  Symmetry: the book and movie
12:52  thesnowdog: I have a soft spot for that too I must admit but haven't thought of it in nearly 30 years. :)
12:53  Symmetry: I watch the movie every several months
12:56  thesnowdog: I think I saw it as a double with Raiders of the Lost Ark...an interesting mix.
12:56  Symmetry: I can't imagine that'd be anything but weird.
12:56  thesnowdog: Hmmm, tab numbers cause the "add tab" button to float around apparently.  I thought that was an old but fixed bug? :(
12:57  Symmetry: I saw Wizards (the Ralph Bakshi film) as a double feature with The Last Starfighter or something. I was bored immediately, but then when a halfling type person got a hole blown through his chest...well, suffice it to say 9-year-old Symmetry was intrigued
13:03  thesnowdog: Symmetry: Finally someone as old as myself around these parts.
13:04  Symmetry: Probably not quite as old, I went to a theater that showed old fantasy/scifi films together when I was young
13:04  Symmetry: I'm 31 as of this May
13:06 * thesnowdog thought he might be making baseless assumptions
13:07  Symmetry: oh, not baseless
13:07  Symmetry: perfectly reasonable
13:07 * thesnowdog was about 9 years old at the time of release of these
14:12  stepnem: Symmetry: What exactly do you teach? And what do you play?
18:02  iaj: is there any way to unfocus flash elements?
18:25  iaj: can I external communicate to firefox...  eg. to let firefox execute a javascript or something :D
21:51 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 5d35d7d582b7f55ec5aa7a6bd5cd534d92087db3 /common/content/hints.js Fix hint generating bug. Closes issue #178.
21:54 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 67750d834759a84cbe8cb24f8ca58cc5ed7bb0d5 /common/locale/en-US/styling.xml Update help pages for removal of Gradient highlight groups. Closes issue #177.
22:17  John-Galt: Ooh. They managed to make a mouse with two biological fathers...
22:18  John-Galt: I can't wait for all of the conservative ranting about the gay conspiracy to corrupt us all.
23:11  Symmetry: stepnem: I'm a professor of pregrad music theory and performance on a number of instruments and ensembles, and I play pretty much any instrument you can name. My principals are the violin and piano, though
23:47  anon33_: i don't know how to detect it at all, but lately the pentadactyl addon has just quit working for me on some windows
23:47  anon33_: using the 3rd beta with firefox 4.0b7
