14:14  stepnem: :'( HTMLCollection blech...
14:15  stepnem: Do we have some shorthand for Array.prototype.slice.call(), by any chance?
14:21  thesnowdog: stepnem: You can use the 'generics' version Array.slice(arrayish)
14:22  stepnem: thesnowdog: And how do I know what's arrayish enough to support that?
14:31  thesnowdog: stepnem: They just need to support numerical property indexes and a length property
14:32  stepnem: thesnowdog: thanks
14:54  thesnowdog: NP, I'm awaiting the super feature you must be adding.

15:16  thesnowdog: Sure, but he rode this one in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_fox_(cablecar) not this one: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/images/070918-flying-fox.jpg
15:19  John-Galt: Hm. But the second one is a bat, and the first one isn't even a mammal.
15:19  thesnowdog: I guess you call them zip-lines?
15:20  heftig: yes
15:20  John-Galt: Yeah, I was just about to say that. I've never heard them called flying foxes.
15:20  heftig: flying foxes are the toy ones found on playgrounds
15:21  thesnowdog: heftig: According to this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip-line "except in Australia and New Zealand". *shrug*
15:21  John-Galt: We still call them zip lines.
15:23 * thesnowdog wonders what John-Galt thought of Jackman before this incident
15:24  John-Galt: Not much, but an appearance on Opera is enough to lower my opinion of anyone.
15:24  John-Galt: Except perhaps Christopher Hitchens, who I think would be a rather entertaining guest.
15:24  John-Galt: Especially while he's dieing of cancer...
15:25  thesnowdog: Oh, he's sick? I hadn't heard.
15:25  John-Galt: Plus, what good is Hugh Jackman if he can't even ride a zip line properly? He's supposed to be a hard ass action hero.
15:26  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Probably mortally so, yes, not that it seems to slow him down any.
15:26  thesnowdog: Really, I always thought of him as a camp broadway star.
15:27  thesnowdog: Yes, doesn't sound good.
15:27  John-Galt: He managed to eviscerate Tony Blair in a debate even though he couldn't even stand for it. I still have to watch that. I'm saving it.
15:29  thesnowdog: This one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNxss3IQluQ
15:29  John-Galt: Yep.
15:40  thesnowdog: Well the host has just made the most absurd claim I've heard...ever. I hope the debate is better.
15:43  John-Galt: Well, as I understand it, Blair was as dull and insipid as usual, and Hitchens was as witty and scathing as usual. Hosts are always useless. I suppose now I'll have to stop putting off watching it.
15:43  John-Galt: Although it can wait 'til I wake up.
15:48 * thesnowdog thought you were supposed to be waking up about an hour ago...
15:49  John-Galt: Eh, my sleep cycles so rarely match up to solar cycles.
16:10  thesnowdog: Meh, it's a total *yawn* if you ask me.
