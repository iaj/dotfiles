21:36  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You only live once.
21:47 --- John-Galt is now known as Guest1515
21:47 --- John-Ga1t is now known as john-galt
21:47 --- john-galt is now known as John-Galt
21:47  John-Galt: thesnowdog: There are some crackpots who say different.
21:49  Chousuke: :)
21:49  Chousuke: too bad they won't be able to feel disappointment after they're dead.
21:49  Chousuke: that would be fun.
21:50  Chousuke: and kind of oxymoronic :P
21:50 * thesnowdog is frustrated by failed suicides
21:51  John-Galt: "It's a shame that there isn't a hell for him to go to" --Christopher Hitchens on Jerry Falwell
21:51  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Cries for attention. Such is life.
21:51  thesnowdog: I don't know, a bullet to the head is a risky cry for help
21:52  John-Galt: Hm. It's my understanding that such attempts usually don't fail.
21:52  John-Galt: Slit wrists, however, are apparently quite difficult to do properly.
21:54  thesnowdog: http://tinyurl.com/22ky76n
21:57  thesnowdog: Reminds me of the Judas Priest suicide pact.
21:57 * thesnowdog dates himself yet again
21:58  thesnowdog: Hopefully this women's parents won't sue the range or simlar
21:58  John-Galt: Wow... It's pretty pathetic when you fail to kill yourself with a bullet to the head.
21:59  Chousuke: the human body is suprisingly resilient sometimes
21:59  Chousuke: though you probably won't survive a gunshot wound to the head without *some* side-effects
22:02  John-Galt: Well, generally a bullet in the brain will do the trick. Especially at point blank range. Tissue nearby tends to be liquified.
22:05 * John-Galt really needs that coffee...
22:05  John-Galt: Soo much to do before next week.

22:14 * John-Galt notes that his immediate family includes a born-again Jesus freak who works at a Christian daycare center and listens to Christian pop and rock...
22:14  John-Galt: and a crackpot who always things the world is going to end in a few years, even though it continually fails to do so.
22:15  John-Galt: w00t. 4299   T  Nov 19 16:14  Mozilla Add-ons (  19) Mozilla Add-ons: Pentadactyl 1.0b3 reviewed by
22:15  John-Galt: Hm. I though we had a first run page?
22:16  thesnowdog: John-Galt: We certainly used to.
22:16  John-Galt: The code is still there. /me tests.
22:16  thesnowdog: grep firstrun is silent. :)
22:17  John-Galt:         const firstTime = "extensions." + config.name + ".firsttime";
22:17  John-Galt:         if (prefs.get(firstTime, true)) {
22:17  John-Galt:             util.timeout(function () {
22:17  John-Galt:                 dactyl.help();
22:17  John-Galt:                 prefs.set(firstTime, false);
22:17  John-Galt:             }, 1000);
22:17  John-Galt:         }
22:17  thesnowdog: Ah, my memory fails me yet again.
22:18  thesnowdog: Although firstrun would be a better name.
22:18  John-Galt: Probably. I didn't choose the name.
22:18  John-Galt: Yep, I get a first run page.
22:18  thesnowdog: Those reviewers...
22:18  John-Galt: Oh, and a bunch of warnings. Have to do something about that.
22:19  John-Galt: Actually, I think that the problem may be that it opens in the same tab. No good, that.
22:19  John-Galt: In fact, it should have been rejected on those grounds.
22:21  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I see you do have some marketing spirit lurking in those bones. Vimperator NextGen. :)
22:22  John-Galt: ร.รณ
22:24 * thesnowdog is ashamed of our Wiggles export
22:25  John-Galt: Wiggles?
22:29  John-Galt: Oh my...
22:30 +CIA-8: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * ae771cbc8db49eba9bcb9f9d01f1fc2d648a4fbc / (5 files in 3 dirs) Open the firstrun page in a new tab.
