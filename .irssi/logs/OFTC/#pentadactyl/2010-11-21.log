21:12  aksr: can i map a "minimize window", is there a function for it ?
21:28  John-Galt: I don't know. There's no such concept as minimized windows on my computer.
21:28  John-Galt: I could tell you what to do in X11, though...
21:30  John-Galt: aksr: Apparently there is. window.minimize()
21:34  aksr: John-Galt, i'm on xp
21:34  aksr: win xp
21:44  aksr: John-Galt, could you be more specific ?
21:45  John-Galt: :js window.minimize()
21:49  aksr: John-Galt, thank you..
22:01  aksr: John-Galt, is it possible to bind two js commands to same keybinding ?
22:01  aksr: noremap <A-m> :js window.maximize()<CR>
22:01  aksr: noremap <A-m> :js window.restore()<CR>
22:02  aksr: i want this two, on the same keybinding..
22:03  stepnem: aksr: you've made my day
22:03  aksr: stepnem, why ?
22:04  stepnem: aksr: just think about it -- if you bind a command to a key, then bind another to the same key, what happens?
22:05  aksr: it will you the first command..
22:05  stepnem: seems like you made John-Galt fall off the channel
22:05  aksr: use*
22:06  stepnem: aksr: no, the second binding will overwrite the first one
22:06  stepnem: aksr: but even if you have no idea whatsoever how things work, just think about it -- what would you like to happen with two different commands bound to the same key?
22:08  aksr: stepnem, when the window is maximized, i want it with keybinding to become "restore" window(smaller).., when windows is "restore"(smaller), i want to maximize
22:08  aksr: is there a way, for ff to knows when the window is maximized or small ?
22:09  aksr: and then to react properly with the same keybinding
22:09  aksr: am i more clear now ?
22:10  stepnem: yes
22:10  stepnem: (or rather, now you're making some sense ;-))
22:10  aksr: i was thinking this, in the first place
22:10  aksr: :)
22:11  stepnem: aksr: doesn't <F11> do what you want, by any chance?
22:11  aksr: stepnem, not the fullscreen
22:12  stepnem: OK; well, then you'll have to define a command that checks for the current state and changes it to what you want yourself
22:12  stepnem: as to how to do that, I don't know
22:12  aksr: :)
22:13  stepnem: (on my system there is no minimized window concept either)
22:13  aksr: which OS ?
22:13  stepnem: Linux
22:13  aksr: i also use linux(suse), but i started with winxp
22:14  stepnem: you'll have to do some research I guess; for example I see a window.STATE_MAXIMIZED property, perhaps you could check that and call minimize() or restore() depending on its value
22:15  stepnem: or maximize() or whatever
22:18  aksr: stepnem, maybe to make loop 
22:27  thesnowdog: aksr: :map <A-m> -js window.windowState == window.STATE_MAXIMIZED ? window.restore() : window.maximize()
22:28  thesnowdog: Might be what you're after assuming restore does what I assume it does.
22:28  thesnowdog: But, why aren't you using your window manager to manage the window?
22:29 * thesnowdog recommends his mother not ask questions on #pentadactyl
22:30  stepnem: Well, as long as they're not computer-related... ;-)
22:33 * aksr finds stepnem metaphor funny
22:33 * aksr finds thesnowdog metaphor, funny
22:34  stepnem: @_@
22:34  John-Galt: ?
22:34  stepnem: John-Galt: boy you missed a lot in the last 10 minutes!
22:34  John-Galt: Hm.
22:35  stepnem: actually it was more like half an hour...
22:35  aksr: thesnowdog, works
22:36  aksr: thesnowdog, thank you
22:40  thesnowdog: Poor Charlie.  A lifetime of waiting for the crown only to be denied by online polls in favour of the spawn of that hussy.
22:40  thesnowdog: aksr: Welcome
22:43 * John-Galt thinks it was better days when they used to lynch and behead royalty.
22:44  stepnem: o_O
22:45  John-Galt: Just saying. They don't serve any purpose.
22:46  stepnem: 〇_〇
22:48  John-Galt: Well, if they valued their heads, they could always abdicate.
22:49  John-Galt: Although, since they don't seem to have much need for them, at least any part aside from their mouths, I kind of doubt that they do.
23:01  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I'll see what I can arrange if you do the same for yours.
23:13  John-Galt: Eh, at least ours are elected.
23:14  thesnowdog: I was referring to Queen Oprah and her ilk.
23:14  John-Galt: Ah, well, at least she's not supported by taxes and has not official position in government.
23:15  John-Galt: Hell, your Queen dissolved Canada's parliment so they couldn't vote no confidence in their Prime Minister the other year.
23:15  John-Galt: s/not/no/
23:17  thesnowdog: You're complaining that she did some work now...
23:19  John-Galt: Eh, I've got issues with unelected dilettantes interfering in government.
23:19  John-Galt: If she did something useful, it might be a different story.
23:25 * John-Galt admittedly has issues with elected tilettantes interfering in government, too...
23:26  thesnowdog: Goes without saying...
23:42 * thesnowdog wonders aloud why he can't seem to finish reading questions before answering anymore...assumption such a nasty beast
