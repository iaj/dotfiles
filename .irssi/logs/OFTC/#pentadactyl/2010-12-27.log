09:19  stepnem: John-Galt: I've been getting this error: http://pastebin.com/kELP80Wt
09:19  stepnem: (on the bootstrapped branch)
09:20  stepnem: It also makes FF completely unusable afterwards, only mouse works.
14:56  John-Galt: stepnem: Weird. When does it happen?
14:57  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, as the backtrace shows: when I do :styletoggle -name Easy<CR>
14:57  stepnem: I have it mapped to a key.
14:57  John-Galt: Ah, sorry. Not awake yet.
14:57  stepnem: Same thing happens when I do :tabduplicate<CR>, also from a mapping, although doing the same manually seems to work fine.
14:58  John-Galt: Why don't you use :map -ex?
14:58  stepnem: Hysterical raisins.
14:59  stepnem: There was no -ex option at that time...
14:59  John-Galt: What do you have for 'go'?
14:59  stepnem: CrsnM
15:00  John-Galt: Nevermind, -silent is enough.
15:01  John-Galt: Weird that it completely seizes like that.
15:03  stepnem: Using -ex fixes the problem, yeah.
15:03  stepnem: s/fixes/avoids/
15:07  John-Galt: Ah, it gets stuck with events.feedingKeys = true.

15:45  tlonim: btw, on web pages with horizontal scrollbars in pre elements, how do you scroll it ?
15:46  stepnem: I guess it might be nice if :command also accepted an array instead of a function for the custom completion.
15:46  tlonim: you focus the frame and then zL zH ? 
15:46  tlonim: but that doesnt work
15:46  stepnem: I.e., for simple list completions having to define a function seems a bit of a PITA>
15:48  John-Galt: Why? It's two tokens. Although I do agree that an array would simplify validateCompleter's work.
15:48  John-Galt: tlonim: Can you point me to one?
15:49  tlonim: John-Galt: for example -- check the pre/code boxes here http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#applicative-functors.. 
15:49  tlonim: how do u scroll them without mouse
15:49  tlonim: or should i use a css hack to convert them to wrap or something 
15:49  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, the user wouldn't have to deal with the complexity of internal context representation for simple list completions; he would just supply [[arg1, desc1]...] directly.
15:49  John-Galt: What user?
15:49  stepnem: That's all you need in 99.9% of the cases anyway.
15:49  stepnem: The user that defines a command using :com
15:50  John-Galt: Ah. I didn't realize we were talking about :com (even though you clearly said we were...)
15:50  John-Galt: Yeah, I'll do that.
15:51  stepnem: \o/
15:51  tlonim: so how to scroll those inline scrollbars without mouse 
15:51  John-Galt: tlonim: I have no scrollbars there.
15:51  tlonim: John-Galt: well.. some have it..
15:52  John-Galt: Not for me, they don't.
15:52  tlonim: that was just an example
15:52  tlonim: there are many sites with suck boxes
15:52  tlonim: John-Galt: wait..i will post a screenshot then
15:53  tlonim: John-Galt: http://ompldr.org/vNnF1Yg
15:53  John-Galt: Scrolling works for me.
15:54  tlonim: John-Galt: horizontal ? 
15:54  tlonim: i mean how do you scroll only that element
15:54  John-Galt: l and h. Works as expected for me.
15:55  tlonim: hmm.. l and h will scroll inside the pre box ? how does it know not to scoll the whole page
15:55  John-Galt: The same way it knows for vertical scrolling elements.
15:56  tlonim: what if there are multiple such elements, how will i choose among them..
15:57  tlonim: s/i/it/
15:58  John-Galt: You have to either click them or use ;F
15:58  tlonim: actually i tried ;F ..not working i think
15:58  tlonim: lemme see again
15:58  John-Galt: Yeah, it doesn't know to check <pre>s. You'll have to add it to 'eht'
15:59  John-Galt: Crap, option default value completion seems broken.
15:59  tlonim: John-Galt: aha. cool.
15:59  John-Galt: Well, for 'eht' and 'ht' at least.
15:59  John-Galt: Ah, nevermind, it's because they're so long.
16:03  John-Galt: :rehash is so bloody awesome...
16:03 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 6b2e9401f9c07f8dadd5903be88de11c18ffa75e /common/content/ (commandline.js dactyl.js hints.js) Check <pre/> and <code/> elements in ;F.
16:05  stepnem: Hm... is there no way to have a -js :command definition span multiple lines?
16:06  John-Galt: Yes, there is. Just put \ at the beginning of the subsequent lines.
16:06  stepnem: Ah...! Vim...
16:06  John-Galt: You should perhaps be able to use a heredoc, but you can't, I don't think.
16:06  stepnem: Yeah, heredoc didn't work.
16:06  tlonim: yeah..heredoc didnt work for me either
16:06  tlonim: tried sometime back though
16:07  John-Galt: It only works for commands that specify it. You can do :js commands.get("map").hereDoc = true
16:08  stepnem: Thanks.
16:08  stepnem: Using :rehash hides my tab line.
16:09  John-Galt: Does it? Doesn't for me.
16:09  John-Galt: Must be something weird in your rc.
16:09  stepnem: Indeed.
16:09  tlonim: stepnem: you use buftabs for tabline or the firefox default one ?
16:09  stepnem: tlonim: The default one.
16:10  stepnem: Eh, not only that, I got the good ol' freeze, too.
16:18  John-Galt: Yeah, have to click. Still working on that.
16:18  John-Galt: But it has nothing to do with :rehash
16:18  John-Galt: Can you pastebin your rc?
16:18  stepnem: Well, if clicking fixed that, that'd be great, but it doesn't...
16:19  John-Galt: Really? Hm.

17:19  John-Galt: stepnem: Your rc gives me lots of this: chrome://dactyl/content/bookmarks.js: 451: TypeError: opts.title is null
17:19  John-Galt: I'm also sad to say that I've not got several dozen bookmarks I have to manually delete...
17:20  stepnem: Heh... never load anything without inspecting it first... yeah it sucks, but it's primarily FF bookmarks system that sucks.
17:20  stepnem: As to that error, I've never seen it myself. Interesting.
17:21  John-Galt: Doesn't leave a stack trace. :(
17:23  John-Galt: stepnem: What about your color scheme?
17:23  stepnem: John-Galt: You've seen it recently.
17:23  stepnem: Wanna me pastebin it again?
17:23  John-Galt: I know, but I don't have it on hand.
17:24  John-Galt: (incidentally, you can just do :colo darkness or :runt colors/darkness)
17:24  stepnem: Yeah, I know (the former probably wouldn't work with the .vimp extension now)
17:24  stepnem: http://pastebin.com/fBarh5fZ
17:24  stepnem: or the latter even
17:25  John-Galt: Well, you need the extenson with the latter.
17:26  John-Galt: Oh, look, no tabs...
17:26  John-Galt: And a crash...
17:26  stepnem: ^_^
17:27  John-Galt: And that bloody bug isn't fixed.
17:28  stepnem: John-Galt: How did you spot the the option.title thing?
17:28  stepnem: opts*
17:29  John-Galt: It filled the MOW.
17:29  stepnem: Oh, weird. Never happened to me.
17:29  John-Galt: Hm. Come to think of it, I don't get a tab line at all with your RC after a normal startup...
17:30  John-Galt: Sans colorscheme, anyway.
17:30  John-Galt: Nevermind. Session restore+stal=1...
17:32  John-Galt: :( :rehash always seems to crash Firefox with your rc.
17:33  stepnem: Try removing the ASCII art.
17:33  John-Galt: Heh. Not likely.
17:35  John-Galt: Might be the mozrepl bit.

18:57  John-Galt: stepnem: That might fix your bug.
20:29  tlonim: John-Galt: there seems to some bug with scrolling part mentioned earlier.. 
20:29  tlonim: now i am able to focus with ;F 
20:29  tlonim: but h,l dont scroll
20:29  tlonim: but insert mode correctly positions the cursor
20:30  John-Galt: ?
20:30  tlonim: John-Galt: the scrollbar thing
20:30  tlonim: h,l dont scroll 
20:30  tlonim: but if i focus with mouse
20:30  John-Galt: What do you mean about insert mode?
20:30  tlonim: and then use h,l it works
20:30  John-Galt: Caret mode?
20:30  tlonim: lol..yeah
20:31  tlonim: i mean caret mode
20:31  tlonim: so there is something with focus by ;F and mouse focus
20:31  tlonim: their end result is not identical
20:31  John-Galt: I see.
20:32  tlonim: yes.i confirm
20:32  tlonim: i have two such boxes
20:33  tlonim: one -- focus with mouse, then ;F and scroll works 
20:33  John-Galt: The problem is that for some reason the body gets set as the active element. I'll take care of it in a bit.
20:33  tlonim: other one doesnt work
20:33  tlonim: John-Galt: ok.. 
20:33  tlonim: i see.
20:33  tlonim: John-Galt: cool.thanks
20:40  stepnem: John-Galt: Still the same.
20:41  John-Galt: stepnem: The tab line thing?
20:41  stepnem: Yeah.
20:41  John-Galt: Ok. Well, it's be easier to fix if my browser didn't crash.
20:42  stepnem: Well, it's no biggie really, I have a key binding to toggle it anyway. The focus issues are way more annoying.
20:43  John-Galt: Indeed.
