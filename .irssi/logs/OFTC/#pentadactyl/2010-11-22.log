00:03  John-Galt: Possibly because people tend to ask the same stupid questions repeatedly?
00:04  John-Galt: Off to procure some hoppy agents of intoxication...
00:10  mib_8es0z7: hi, i would like to know if its possible, to put the statusline on the top. 
00:39  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Perhaps but I'm doing with it everyone - even interesting and intelligent folks.  Maybe the silly repetitive ones have simply broken me.
00:40 * thesnowdog never asks absurd questions, never ever
00:40  thesnowdog: Likewise, why didn't I notice that mib_8es0z7 had bailed before starting to type an answer.
00:40 * thesnowdog is just losing his mind obviously
00:41  stepnem: thesnowdog: you can answer anyway, I can search the logs next time someone asks it :-)
00:42  stepnem: (unless your answer was just "you have to mess with the XUL definitions" or something)
00:46  John-Galt: thesnowdog: I noticed it only just in time. You generally tend to expect them to stick around long enough to get an answer.
00:47  John-Galt: stepnem: My answer was: Possible, yes. Silly, yes.
00:49  stepnem: yeah, well "silly" is subjective; it sounds crazy to me as well, but...  each to their own
01:40  John-Galt: Awesome: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/76161
01:40  John-Galt: Doesn't get rid of the preview garbage, though...
01:56  John-Galt: Anyone else feel like getting rid of the iframes in the MOW and completion lists?
01:58  John-Galt: Oh, it just about worked. Nifty.
02:03  qotsa: I have a very weird issue. When I go to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Networkmanager#Configuration and then zoom in with zI I am not able to scroll down anymore with j, C-d and C-f. Scrolling up still works.
02:04  John-Galt: qotsa: :version ?
02:04  qotsa: 1.0b3
02:05  John-Galt: I need the whole output of :version please.
02:05  qotsa: When you remove the #Configuration anchor from the URL it works again.
02:05  John-Galt: Interesting.

02:05  qotsa: sorry
02:06  qotsa: I had this issue every once in a while on vimperator but could not reproduce it.
02:06  qotsa: With this wiki page I can.
02:07  John-Galt: I've only had Windows users report that problem. I've never been able to reproduce it, at any rate.
02:07  qotsa: So it does not happen for you with this site?
02:07  John-Galt: But I can with those instructions.
02:07  qotsa: ok
02:08  qotsa: At least I know that I'm not crazy now. :D
02:09  John-Galt: Heh
02:44  qotsa: bye

13:12 --- frakturfreak1 is now known as frakturfreak
15:01  remi: I want to create a custom command that would perform the mapping "gi" and then "CTRL-Z". how can I do that? I tried :command! docs gi^z
15:03  Chousuke: gi<C-z>
15:04  stepnem: remi: :h :normal
15:04  stepnem: :h key-notation
15:04  stepnem: (although I kind of doubt you really want a command, so... :h :map)
15:06  C2H5OH: hi
15:08  remi: stepnem: thanks! but I'm coming to the conclusion that using google docs with pentadactyl on a mac is a lot of work
15:09  stepnem: remi: you might also be interested in the new 'passkeys' option
15:10  stepnem: and 'strictfocus'
15:10  C2H5OH: how can I enable autocomplete only for the :buffer, :back and :forward commands?
15:11  stepnem: C2H5OH: :h 'autocomplete
15:12  C2H5OH: stepnem: sorry, I should be more specific
15:12  C2H5OH: I tried with :set autocomplete=/ex/buffer
15:12  C2H5OH: but that disables autocomplete entirely
15:18  stepnem: hm, yeah, looks like it's really broken
15:19  stepnem: ah!
15:19  C2H5OH: ?
15:19  C2H5OH: did you find anything?
15:23  stepnem: well, it seems to work for disabling specific contexts, but you want the opposite, which doesn't work; still seems broken to me, sorry
15:27  remi: stepnem: if I set my passkeys option to this: 'https://docs\.google\.com'
15:27  remi: in theory, any pentadactyl key should *not* be working in Google Docs
15:30  stepnem: remi: well, in 'passkeys' you're supposed to list specific keys you want to pass, as you see in the example; if you want to pass all keys, have a look at :h autocmd-examples
15:31  C2H5OH: stepnem: then I'll open a bug report
15:32  stepnem: C2H5OH: no need, you already reported it here ;-)
15:32  stepnem: thanks
15:33  stepnem: (of course if you want to be notified when it's fixed and won't stay here, you can open a bug report anyway)
15:34  remi: stepnem: thanks for the autocmd-examples bit, I was using an old version of the command to exclude google domains
15:35  stepnem: remi: let's hope it will do what you want
15:39  C2H5OH: stepnem: oh sorry, I already filled the report
15:40  stepnem: C2H5OH: OK, thanks
15:43  remi: stepnem: it looks like it's working. although I sometimes have to press <Esc> to get in pass-through mode
15:45  stepnem: great; the <Esc> is perhaps needed when you have to get out of a text field or some focused element, i.e. as usual?
16:56  John-Galt: The opposite does work, but you need to enable all contexts prior to /ex/buffer, too.
17:21  stepnem: John-Galt: what do you mean? If you enable /ex, all ex commands will auto-complete
17:40  anon33_: weird - should tabdo tabattach <win#> attach all tabs in that window to another?
17:58  John-Galt: stepnem: /ex/(buffer|back|forward),!/ex/.,.*
17:59  stepnem: John-Galt: heh, I see... crazy
18:00  John-Galt: Necessary. Sub-contexts are never called if their parents aren't called. It's the nature of the thing. It's also, as I recall, explained in :help
18:01  stepnem: yeah it is, that's why I thought it just wasn't possible (short of explicitly disabling all the other contexts); I didn't think about the solution above
18:02  John-Galt: Well, the other option is to use $ in the pattern. I.e., /ex/(buffer|back|forward),^(/|/ex/?)$
18:02  stepnem: honestly I still thing that improving the algorightm so that /ex/(buffer|back|forward) would just do the right thing would be better
18:02  stepnem: think*
18:02  John-Galt: Not really feasible.
18:03  John-Galt: Except by calling the whole tree and only providing the list for matching contexts, which I've considered doing, but has performance considerations.
18:07  C2H5OH: John-Galt: I can't make work your example either
18:07  C2H5OH: at least on Windows
18:07  C2H5OH: I'll try on Linux at home
18:07  stepnem: works for me
18:07  C2H5OH: I'm using 1.0b3
18:07  C2H5OH: should I upgrade to nightlies?
18:09  stepnem: there's just a minor glitch in that for the disabled contexts, "Options\nWaiting for Tab" is displayed even in contexts where it doesn't make sense
18:10  C2H5OH: well, I get that in any case
18:10  C2H5OH: maybe there is an issue with the windows firefox
18:10  C2H5OH: I'll reconnect later on
18:10  C2H5OH: or else add a comment in the issue
18:10  C2H5OH: gotta go
18:10  C2H5OH: see you later ;-)
18:20  iaj: j
18:21  iaj: oops sorry.
23:57  John-Galt: Bots...
