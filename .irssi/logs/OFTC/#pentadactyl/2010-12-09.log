00:02  thesnowdog: iaj: Because sometimes there's meaningful labels (real or deduced) and sometimes there's not.
00:03  iaj: thesnowdog: ah.. is there some way to turn that behaviour off?
00:06  thesnowdog: Not really, the 'label' provides the typeable hint text in such cases. It's a feature.  I assume you're using char hints?
00:08  Chousuke: I'd like to turn it off too
00:08  Chousuke: It's mostly annoying
00:09  Chousuke: I use charhints because half the time there's no ascii link text to narrow down the selection.
00:09  Chousuke: number hints are too english-biased :(
00:09  stepnem: Hm, I never even noticed that. Has it always been there?
00:09  Chousuke: and text-biased :P
00:40  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Oh, heh, did I commit that?
00:42  John-Galt: Chousuke: There's nothing wrong with being text biased. And there are reasons that the alt attribute is required. At any rate, yes, you can turn it off.
00:44  Chousuke: [C
00:44  Chousuke: oops
00:46  Chousuke: Yean, I just consider charhints superior :P
00:47  John-Galt: Well, that probably makes you inferior, but who knows.
00:47  Chousuke: Damn phone IRC is slow
00:47  stepnem: eh, why does keys return a generator, I want an array
00:47  John-Galt: Then use Object.keys
00:47  stepnem: great, thanks
00:48  Chousuke: or well , touchxceen typing is
00:58  John-Galt: You'd think that 3GB of RAM would be enough to link libxul without my machine thrashing itself into the ground. But, alas, no.
01:21 * John-Galt listens to Stephen Colbert interview Deepak Chopra and tries to decide whether to laugh or gag.
01:22  John-Galt: It certainly takes some balls to tell a TV host that he's a figment of your imagination.
01:26 * John-Galt is thinking that it would be better for the species if someone cut off said balls.
01:28  John-Galt: Although I'm not so sure of the logic of selling a book to figments of your imagination telling them that you're a figment of their imagination...
01:28  John-Galt: Hm.
01:33 * John-Galt wonders if this Agora flick is any good...
03:05  iaj: hmm I know theres nextpattern, but what if theres a button on the page with a <a id="____Previous"> or <a id="____Next"> theres no way to filter those too by using ]] [[ right?
03:10  stepnem: Let's allow - and _ in command names.
03:12  stepnem: (I see no reason not to allow anything but ! and numbers, but not allowing - is ridiculous)
03:13  iaj: nvm got it sorted:-)
03:15  stepnem: And it's broken as it is anyway -- it lets you define a command programmatically with an invalid name and only errors out when you then try to use it.
03:16  iaj: Hmm another question can I change somehow a fixedwith for the place for urls in :tabopen <tab> ?
03:16  John-Galt: stepnem: Don't we?
03:16  stepnem: John-Galt: nope [a-zA-Z]
03:17  John-Galt: Hm. Fluke.
03:17  John-Galt: Can someone respond to http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/167 please?
03:25  stepnem: John-Galt: Unfortunately that's one of those unparsable ones for me.
03:26  John-Galt: They want to skip the hint number '1' when there are 10 or more hints, '1' and '2' when there are 20 or more, and so on.
03:26  stepnem: BTW, did you by any chance change the GC project access setup or something? I'm getting 403 "You're not allowed to view contents of this project" when trying to get the issue comments feed.
03:26  John-Galt: it's insane and there's no way I'm doing it, but I don't know what to respond with other than, "you're insane"
03:26  stepnem: Oh, that's insane.
03:26  John-Galt: Erm, as far as I know I can't do any such thing.
03:27  stepnem: OK.
03:28  John-Galt: Seems to work for me, anyway.
03:28  stepnem: (it's actually "You are not allowed to view this project")
03:29  stepnem: yeah, I'm making some experiments, the problem is probably elsewhere
04:08  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Since you were curious: http://pastebin.com/NSCP42RY But I still think it's evil so I'm not sure I'm going to keep it.
04:19  stepnem: The feeds don't leave any trace of any attachements either. Google fail.
04:20  John-Galt: Yeah, that's irritating.
04:20  stepnem: John-Galt: They're not on the mailing list, either? A link, nothing?
04:21  John-Galt: A mention, but not a link.
04:21  John-Galt: Although, anyone with enough ambition could write a munger based on the issue API.
04:22  stepnem: How? I don't remember seeing anything like that.
04:22  stepnem: I do already have code to talk with the API, but the issue links don't seem to have any obvious relation to the issue.
04:22  John-Galt: Ok... :set editor='gvim -f %[+%L%] %F' perhaps... perhaps.
04:23  John-Galt: stepnem: Hm? How not?
04:23  stepnem: John-Galt: well, I mean the issue ID
04:23  John-Galt: They're part of the links, though...
04:23  stepnem: Doesn't look like that: http://dactyl.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=932453292320142456&name=Test.htm&token=121dca0cfb42ad2314b6193e2807329d
04:24  John-Galt: Oh, you mean the attachment links? Donno about them, but I don't see why it should matter either.
04:25  stepnem: Oh, you mean scraping the link from the web page?
04:25  stepnem: o_O
04:25  John-Galt: No, I mean scraping it from the issue API.
04:25  stepnem: How?
04:26  John-Galt: Donno. Perhaps it's not possible.
04:26  stepnem: I read the docs.
04:26  stepnem: Don't rememeber anything about attachments.
04:27  stepnem: Google fail.
04:27  stepnem: Comment by nomeata, Nov 27, 2009  I’m missing an API to access the attachements of a ticket, e.g. patches.
04:27  stepnem: ;-/
04:27  John-Galt: I see.
04:29  stepnem: (The next comment is "Feature requests for the API should go in our issue tracker: http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/list. They are not likely to be noticed on this page.")
04:29  stepnem: Har har.
04:29  John-Galt: Well, I suppose I'm not above scraping the HTML. Makes it trickier to get a login ticket, though.
04:30  John-Galt: Although I suppose you don't have to be.
04:30  stepnem: Yeah, you shouldn't. It's settable, though (that's why I asked earlier).
04:31 * John-Galt considers the wisdom of using formats for 'editor'... :(
04:31  John-Galt: I don't like it.
05:25  stepnem: Why is Object.keys not a method on Object instances? Object.keys(obj) is so awkward.
05:53  John-Galt: stepnem: Because then if someone set the keys property on the object everything would be fubar.
05:53  stepnem: John-Galt: well, that can be set about any similar properties, no?
05:53  John-Galt: Which is the same reason that you so often need to do Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj) rather than obj.hasOwnProperty
05:53  stepnem: s/set/said/
05:54  John-Galt: Of course it can. That doesn't make it a good idea.
05:54  stepnem: Hm, dunno. By this reasoning you can conclude that OO in general is not a good idea.
05:56  John-Galt: Not really. JS objects are just a mess. There's no such problem in Python because obj['foo'] ≢ obj.foo.
05:56  stepnem: It is (or would be) a property defined by the language standard, so if someone overrides it, they deserve to suffer.
05:57  stepnem: Hm, I don't see how that's related.
05:57  John-Galt: Not so, for a lot of reasons, including the fact that objects are very often used for arbitrary hash keys.
05:57  stepnem: Ah, hm...
06:53  John-Galt: They've managed to nearly ruin IMDB...
07:31  Symmetry: well, I've finally taken the final step and removed my bookmarks bar
07:31  Symmetry: ...maybe not the final step, that'd be removing the tab bar
07:39  Symmetry: say, does anyone know what the default size is, in pixels, of the PD status bar and command line?
07:54  NicDumZ: hello guys
07:55  NicDumZ: do you workaround "untrusted connection" dialogs from FF?
07:55  NicDumZ: or, is there is any trick already available to work with these pages from pentadactyl? :)
08:01  Symmetry: does hints mode not show the links?
08:02  NicDumZ: it does, but then it pops up a dialog
08:02  Symmetry: oh
08:02  NicDumZ: ;)
08:02  Symmetry: and tabbing through doesn't work with that?
08:03  NicDumZ: it would be nice if I could script something to handle this in the CmdLine
08:04  NicDumZ: sadly when that dialog is present, I dont have access to :echo to try to locate this window :)
08:07  NicDumZ: actually gF gives a nice JS source. maybe I can tamper with that.
09:11  John-Galt: Oh, people actually use the bookmarks bar?
09:14  John-Galt: NicDumZ: user_pref("browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert", true);
09:17  NicDumZ: John-Galt: nice, I had just scripted that in a plugin :p
09:18  NicDumZ: so now.. will try to call addException() directly.
09:18  NicDumZ: how can I access the JS context in the current page?
09:18  John-Galt: What do you mean?
09:19  John-Galt: You should be able to just use hints. At any rate, you possibly want content.addException()
09:20  NicDumZ: does not exist, it's hidden in some xul :)
09:20  John-Galt: Hm?
09:21  NicDumZ: function is defined in ./security/manager/pki/resources/content/certManager.js , will have to find a way to access it. but it's okay, i can look around.
09:22  John-Galt: Can you point me to a page with a bad certificate?
09:22  NicDumZ: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328721
09:31  John-Galt: Should be simple enough to do from scratch.
09:34  John-Galt: I'll consider adding a command.
10:03 * John-Galt doesn't think he likes this ginermail person.
10:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#pentadactyl +o FloodServ]
10:05  stepnem: heh
11:35  NicDumZ: John-Galt: something as ugly and hackish as http://en.pastebin.ca/2014599 works for me. I am dumbly chaining actions, tho...
11:45  NicDumZ: and I'll look into adding a specific highlight, something like StatusLineSecurityException to mark https websites that use security exceptions
13:46  addikt1ve: hi :)
13:46  addikt1ve: my pentadactyl is broken following fx4b7 update
13:47  addikt1ve: did it happen to you?
14:03  Chousuke: works for me.
14:03  Chousuke: though I'm not using a very recent nightly
14:03  Chousuke: which version are you using?
14:04  addikt1ve: latest nightly
14:04  addikt1ve: and beta something
14:04  addikt1ve: both failed
14:06  addikt1ve: what's strange is my .pentadactylrc seems cached somewhere
14:06  addikt1ve: since even when I move it, and reinstall pentadactyl, it stills looks like my colorscheme etc.
14:07  addikt1ve: may it be the source of my problem?
14:07  Chousuke: no idea.
14:08  addikt1ve: I guess I'll have to wait for a developper :p

14:09  addikt1ve: :d
14:09  addikt1ve: mmh
14:09  addikt1ve: wrong channel.
15:41  stepnem: addikt1ve: try starting FF with the -purgecaches option
15:41  addikt1ve: stepnem: thanks
15:41  stepnem: Although you seem to be saying that things broke after updating FF, not Pentadactyl, right?
15:42 --- josue is now known as j0su3
15:45  addikt1ve: stepnem: exactly
16:11  addikt1ve: doesn't work stepnem 
16:12  stepnem: addikt1ve: Have you tried with a clean profile?
16:14  addikt1ve: yes and it works stepnem 
16:14  addikt1ve: i would have been happy not to lost my profile...
16:15  stepnem: You can copy relevant data from the old one.
16:15  addikt1ve: sure.
16:16  stepnem: (Or try to find the actual problem. ;-))
16:16  addikt1ve: what's the file containing passwords?
16:23  addikt1ve: mmh
16:23  addikt1ve: I can't find how to change StatusLine font
16:43  addikt1ve: stepnem: any clue how to change statusbar font?
16:45  addikt1ve: and there's a piece of behaviour that changed
16:45  addikt1ve: now :open something doesn't search for "something" on google
16:46  addikt1ve: it says "Invalid URL" (in an infobox :s)
17:10  Chousuke: hm
17:10  Chousuke: that sounds like a bug I used to have
17:10  Chousuke: I don't remember what fixed it
17:10  Chousuke: :(
17:10  addikt1ve: seems like I used to have it too
17:10  addikt1ve: and same situation
17:10  addikt1ve: :d
18:13  pfox_: hoo boy, dactyl in beta 7 is squirrely
18:13  pfox_: sent me running back to firefox 3
18:13  addikt1ve: pfox_: looks like it apparently
18:13  addikt1ve: i'm pissed off now :d
18:13 * pfox_ shrugs
18:13  addikt1ve: I've been trying for 2 hours now...
18:13  pfox_: yeah, i just tried it on a lark this morning
18:13  addikt1ve: bof Fx 3.5 is soooo slow.
18:14  addikt1ve: I'd rather use chromium
18:14  pfox_: you could do a lot worse
18:14  pfox_: and the UX of dactyl in ff 3 makes it worth it
18:16  addikt1ve: yep
20:02  iaj: UX ?
20:02  iaj: :-)

21:10  John-Galt: pfox_: Have you tried a dactyl nightly? At least a half dozen people in here use b7.
21:10  John-Galt: (although I'm not one of them)
21:10  pfox_: yeah im on the nightlies right now
21:10  pfox_: in ff3
21:10  John-Galt: Why?
21:10  pfox_: when i switched to b7, it picked them up and ran with it
21:10  pfox_: why not?
21:12  John-Galt: Because it's slow and oddly enough less stable than the 4.0 betas (which have, among other things, process segregation for plugins).
21:12  pfox_: that is to say that, i installed b7, started it.. went through the "these plugins don't work" dialog (dactyl wasn't on that list) and, when the browser loaded.. it looked just like my ff3 UI
21:12  pfox_: well its pretty freakin' unstable
21:13  pfox_: i was having a lot of grief w/ weird rendering artifacts and buftabs wasn't working so great
21:13  pfox_: and buftabs is kind of a neccessity, if you hide the tab bar
21:14  pfox_: for me, anyways.
21:16  John-Galt: Most of the rendering bugs have been fixed, except for some weird issues with transparent context menus in some extensions.
21:16  John-Galt: And buftabs should work the same on 4b7 as 3.6.
21:24  pfox_: maybe i need to grab a newer version of buftabs
21:24  pfox_: but i was seeing behavior where 90% of the visible window wouldn't update on scrolling (there would be a thin strip at the top and bottom of the rendered html page that would update)
21:25  pfox_: and situations where the visible tab wouldn't change, despite doing gt, gT, etc
21:25  pfox_: my installed dactyl is 1.0b4pre
21:26  John-Galt: I've never seen such problems. Except for the tab one, when I had a tab enhancement add-on installed.
22:15  Symmetry: What're the vertical pixel size of the status bar and command line, if you know those offhand?
22:16  John-Galt: Varies from system to system.
22:16  Symmetry: Alright, I'll measure from a screenshot then
22:21  iaj_: when I got a :tabopen http://ofajwijef.someurl.com  is there an easy way to remove everything but the :tabopen ( e.g. the whole url that is ) ?
22:22  John-Galt: iaj_: Yes.
22:22  Symmetry: why not just escape and press t again?
22:24  iaj_: so nothing like C-U or something similar :)
22:24  iaj_: Symmetry: Yeah that's what I've been doing, just wanted to know whether there's a faster way
22:24  Symmetry: ah
22:25  John-Galt: iaj_: No, not unless you bind it. <C-a><S-Right><Right><C-k>
22:25  iaj_: John-Galt: ahh - thanks :)
23:38  Symmetry: is there a way to automatically execute a command once a certain page element has loaded or once the page has loaded?
23:38  Symmetry: or even to press a key (or use an extended command) then specify a buffer to execute the command on
23:38  John-Galt: :h :au
