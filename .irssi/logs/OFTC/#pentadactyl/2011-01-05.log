01:21 * John-Galt got the beer store girl's number.
01:21  John-Galt: And name. It's Heather.
01:21  John-Galt: I had to go back, though... :)
01:24 * John-Galt also got a 4 pack of Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA again. Good night.
01:42 * John-Galt is incidentally rueing deciding not to bring his water bottle with him... and probably a closet Twitterer like thesnowdog...
01:50  John-Galt: Is it just me, or is this thumbnail unsettlingly vulvic? http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/ajbcJiYhFKY/default.jpg
01:50  John-Galt: I keep deleting it from my YouTube recommendations. It keeps coming back.
01:50  John-Galt: (Despite the fact that I have, of course, watched the video)
01:50  graffatcolmingov: Not just you
01:51  John-Galt: Ok. I feel better now.
01:55  John-Galt: Ok. I added way too much pasta to my soup...
01:56  John-Galt: Didn't seem to be absorbing enough water after 10 minutes. I knew I should've waited longer.
01:58  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: I know you like removing extraneous... features... did :tabs ever cross your mind?
01:58  graffatcolmingov: It seems equivalent to B and :buffers
02:00  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: It's just an alias for :buffers. So is B. But we have been removing silly aliases, yes. I prefer to leave that kind of thing to thesnowdog, though.
02:00 * graffatcolmingov shrugs
02:01  John-Galt: Feel free to ask him, though.
02:05  John-Galt: Dude... http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/04/insanely-awesome-solar-eclipse-picture/
02:07  graffatcolmingov: That's pretty freaking awesome
02:07  zeltak: ok..third time i happend to me i guess its a bug :) once every few days ff goes back to normal and penta just disappears..only way to get it back is to uninstall and reinstall penta..no biggie but i thought id report this
02:07  graffatcolmingov: O_o?
02:08  zeltak: well wierd but true.
02:08  John-Galt: zeltak: Possibly an automatic update?
02:08  zeltak: hmmmm maybe..you mean of firefox or penta?
02:09  John-Galt: Firefox automatically updating Pentadactyl.
02:09  John-Galt: I'm not aware of any of the nightlies failing to re-apply, though, but it's possible.
02:09  zeltak: ahhh yeah could be..again its no big issue for me but just thought id raise that
02:10  peth: i had this too and got the impression it's connected to the beta feedback feature
02:11  John-Galt: I don't think so. But I've only tested XPI upgrades a few times. There may still be issues.
02:12  John-Galt: Mmm... Homemade chicken/turkey soup always reminds me of my grandmother.
02:13  graffatcolmingov: It happens to me with 4b8 when I update with an XPI and do :rehash but all I have to do is restart
02:13  John-Galt: Wait... Why would you update the XPI and then :rehash?
02:14  graffatcolmingov: Only did it once (today) because I wasn't sure if it was needed
02:15  John-Galt: It's not. An XPI upgrade should automatically rehash.
02:15  graffatcolmingov: Good to know
02:17  zeltak: John-Galt: i just made excellent soup the other night (chicken though) classic Austrian recipe for granny
02:17  zeltak: can beat chicken noodle soup when your sick/cold
02:17  zeltak: *cant
02:18  John-Galt: True. Sad day when you add too much pasta, though...
02:18  John-Galt: This is what I get for trying variation on a classic.
02:22  zeltak: hehehehe..i never deviate from old granny's classic :)
02:23  John-Galt: Oh, I do. It's mostly the same. Close enough that the taste and smell always remind me of her, but it's hard to get the kind of pasta she used around here, so I had to try something different.
02:25  zeltak: yup
02:29  oeuftete: so it looks like the editor temp file is now just pentadactyl.tmp now by default.  I had some .vimrc stuff set up to trigger ft detection based on host names which doesn't work any more.  What's the best way to feed site-specific info to the editor command now?  I looked at the macro-string stuff but didn't really see how to make it work
02:31  graffatcolmingov: zeltak: https://code.google.com/p/dactyl/issues/detail?id=235 
02:36  zeltak: graffatcolmingov: cool :) im working now and dark ice v2 :)
02:36  John-Galt: oeuftete: Ah, could be. The code responsible was rather magical and was moved to a different namespace recently. I'll rewrite it.
02:36  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: You can just say issue 235
02:36  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/235 ---, Plugin, Colorscheme, , Colorscheme: Simple Dark
02:37  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: didn't know that, but that's awesome
02:37 * John-Galt stole the idea from irc.mozilla.org's firebot...
02:37  oeuftete: John-Galt: ok, it would be wonderful (for me) if it magically went back to the way it was
02:38  John-Galt: It turns out to be surprisingly useful.
02:38  John-Galt: oeuftete: It'll be better than that. I'm going to add a proper extension as well.
02:39  John-Galt: Although only in some circumstances, obviously. Probably not generally for <C-i>. Definitely for gF, though.
02:39  oeuftete: also, it looks like something relatively recent (in the last few weeks) started causing the Tabloc extension to no longer work with Pentadactyl (3.6, Windows).  If you care (and it's fine by me if you don't), I can try to file a proper report
02:39  John-Galt: Within the last 2 days.
02:40  John-Galt: Proper reports are good.
02:40  oeuftete: ok, hopefully tomorrow from work
02:40  John-Galt: Thanks.
02:40  graffatcolmingov: zeltak: I hadn't made a 'dark' colorscheme in a while so I did my best to make it as dark as possible
02:41  John-Galt: Your penultimate color scheme was dark...
02:41  zeltak: looks good graffatcolmingov  ill try it out in a fe minutes :)
02:44  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: half and half... that's why it was odd
02:46  John-Galt: heh.
02:46  zeltak: btw i have to keep adjusting the buftabs colors to the theme..is there a way to make the colorscheme overide the buftabs colors?
02:46  John-Galt: Yes... By overriding the BufTabs colors...
02:47  zeltak: heheh..i guess i missed that one ill look into it :)
02:51  John-Galt: Bugger... I need to merge some fixes into the beta before it hits the top of the queue...
02:51 * John-Galt attempts to revert to his usual misanthropic self enough to get some work done.
02:54  raylu: what happened to hlsearch?
02:54  John-Galt: Oh, but this beer is so good...
02:54  John-Galt: raylu: 'hlfind'
02:54  John-Galt: (it's in NEWS)
02:55  raylu: ah. thanks
02:57 * John-Galt considers (oh, the horror) adding deprecated option aliases.
02:58  John-Galt: thesnowdog: ^ ?
03:02  John-Galt: Anyone know off hand which fixes need to be merged into the beta? I don't feel like digging. And I want to watch an episode of Firefly tonight.
03:04  raylu: also, if i'm on the ff4 beta, i should be using nightlies, right?
03:06  John-Galt: Not necessarily. Nightlies are often unstable (although the current one shouldn't be). b3 will work unless you want to use the external editor. b4.2 is out, but I need to release a b4.3 with a couple of small bug fixes from the latest nightlies.

03:26  jrib: hi, on hg5223 my status line has changed color from black with white text to grey with white text, how do I change it back? :)
03:30  John-Galt: jrib: Probably by fixing your color scheme.
03:30 * John-Galt wonders why when he googles Evengeline there are thousands of hits for Evangeline Lily and none for the song...
03:33  jrib: John-Galt: I've never changed the default colorscheme.  I thought this may be some sort of know bug since the white on gray (and white on white during input) is unreadable.  Let me try an empty rc file to see if it's caused by something in there
03:33  John-Galt: Ah. In that case, you probably need to run Firefox with the -purgecaches flag or just run :rehash
03:34  John-Galt: Unfortunately, the fastload cache doesn't get automatically flushed properly since we became restartless, it seems.
03:34  John-Galt: I need to file a bug with the Firefox people.
03:34  jrib: John-Galt: hmm, "firefox -purgecache" and ":rehash" don't seem to have any noticeable effect color-wise
03:35  John-Galt: -purgecaches -- plural.
03:35  John-Galt: What :version are you on?
03:35  jrib: hg5223 (is that sufficient)?
03:36  John-Galt: No. The output of :version
03:36  jrib: Pentadactyl hg5223 (created: 2011/01/05 00:00:17)
03:36  John-Galt: The second line?
03:37  jrib: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13
03:37  John-Galt: Hm. -purgecaches wouldn't help you there. You might need to remove *.mfasl from your profile dir.
03:38 * John-Galt is always amazed that people will run the bleeding edge of Pentadactyl but the last "stable" of Firefox...
03:38  jrib: I'm only running bleeding edge of pentadactyl because I asked about an issue with stable and was told it was too old here :)
03:39  John-Galt: Heh. I see... Well, you could have used a nightly rather than running straight from the repo. That causes automatic cache flushes.
03:40  jrib: hmm, I installed "Latest Pentadactyl Nightly
03:40  jrib:     " I think and then firefox bugs me once in a while to update
03:40  jrib: from http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/nightlies 
03:40  John-Galt: Ah. I misread your :version output, then. Sorry. Not sure why that'd happen, then. Installing the XPI on 3.6 works for me.
03:40  John-Galt: Are you sure you don't have a color scheme enabled?
03:41  jrib: I renamed .pentadactyl*, that should rule that out, right?
03:41  John-Galt: Not necessarilly. You can run Firefox with -pentadactyl '+u NONE' to rule it out, though.
03:41  jrib: oh
03:44  jrib: hmm, deleting ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/*.mfasl and starting firefox with « firefox -pentadactyl '+u NONE' » produces the same white on gray text.  Let me rename .mozilla and see what happens 
03:44  jrib: wait...
03:44  John-Galt: Weird. Yeah, you might need a new profile.
03:44  jrib: then I have to reinstall pentadactyl :(
03:45  jrib: yes, bar is black now...
03:46  jrib: maybe I'll try disabling some extensions
03:46  John-Galt: I think it's more likely profile corruption, unfortunately, but you could try that.
03:48  John-Galt: Anyway, I have an episode of Firefly to watch, so I may be a while responding.
03:50  jrib: John-Galt: thanks for your help!
03:51  zeltak: firefly is awesome :) its a crime against humanity it got canclled :(
03:53  jrib: John-Galt: figured it out.  I was using the Whitehart firefox theme.  Previously this didn't affect the color of the status bar but now it does
03:53  John-Galt: zeltak: I know! 14 episodes were just not enough. At least they made the movie.
03:53  John-Galt: I'll get around to reading the comics one of these days...
03:53  jrib: i saw the movie first then went and binged on the series for a week :)
03:54  John-Galt: jrib: Ah. I see.
03:54  John-Galt: jrib: Yeah, I did that too. Except that I binged on the series in 14 hours.
03:54  John-Galt: Anyway... → Firefly.
03:54  jrib: enjoy
03:58  zeltak: oooo firefly comics??? ooo torrenting in now with urge :)
04:39  John-Galt: :) ♥ River Tam. ♥ Firefly... ♥ Joss Whedon/Tim Minear
04:39  John-Galt: ... ♥ Beer store girl...
04:41  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: is awfully cheerful tonight, eh?
04:41  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Yeah, good beer, Firefly, and finally asking out the beer store girl... Lots of Yay.
04:43  graffatcolmingov: high five o/
04:43  John-Galt: :)
04:45  zeltak: :)
04:48  John-Galt: Plus... I'm pretty sure that two pints of Dogfish Head ≡ 6 units of alcohol.
05:41 * John-Galt really needs to get around to implementing :set easy ...

14:24  graffatcolmingov: is there an issue 237 posted?
14:24  graffatcolmingov: eris_prime's silence implies there isn't :(
14:31  graffatcolmingov: anyone else getting a 502 error when trying to get to the issues page?
15:59  bnbeckwith: Is there a way to make a dactyl plugin work on only certain pages?
16:24  anon33_: Just want to say that the latest minefield nightly (for linux x64) + pent nightly is smooth like butter :) But still no command for pinning tabs! :(
16:34  John-Galt: bnbeckwith: Possibly. What about it?
16:37  bnbeckwith: John-Galt: I'm trying to recreate a greasemonkey script I have for google reader.  But it only needs to work on google reader's site.
16:38  bnbeckwith: The greasemonkey code uses a key listener that I don't think I would want present on all pages.
16:40  John-Galt: bnbeckwith: Well, there are a lot of ways to do it. Autocommands can be easily filtered by site, for instance.
16:41  bnbeckwith: Sure, but as I understand it, those are just the commands to run, not whole plugins.
16:41  bnbeckwith: Or, am I missing a usage case?
16:42  John-Galt: Right. Plugins run once, at startup, but they can do their work whenever they choose.
16:43  bnbeckwith: So, I only want this one to install the keylistener on the google page.  How do I go about setting that up?
16:43  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: I think there is an issue 237 but Google's servers have been twitchy.
16:43  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/237 ---, New, Defect, Medium, Strictfocus is too strict at times
16:44  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: yeha it went through
16:44  graffatcolmingov: thesnowdog: already replied
16:45  John-Galt: bnbeckwith: Well, you could do it with something like :au DOMLoad '^http://www\.google\.com\/reader' -js doc.addEventListener("keypress", plugins.pluginName.listener, false)
16:45  heftig: seems :dialog print doesn't work anymore in minefield (PrintUtils is not defined)
16:45  John-Galt: Although, really, it'd probably be best to use autocommands.add directly from JavaScript
16:46  bnbeckwith: that sounds good -- then I can make sure that the right autocommands for my functionality get added.
16:47  bnbeckwith: I'll give that a try.  Thanks!
16:49  John-Galt: Sure.

17:18  graffatcolmingov: heh

18:34  stepnem: *sigh* A PDF reader with some kind of (book)marks and capable of reverse video or some other kind of colour customisation, anyone?
18:36  stepnem: (By "colour customisation" I mean _both_ the UI and the content)
18:39  stepnem: Why the hell does xpdf have no marks; otherwise it'd be fine.
18:41  John-Galt: Well, Okular.
18:41  John-Galt: Color customization, probably not. You can set the default page color, but changing colors of PDFs isn't as trivial as it is for HTML, by a long shot.
18:42  stepnem: Yeah, I know, but it's crucial for me.
18:42  John-Galt: It doesn't even seem feasible.
18:42  stepnem: At least a reverse video mode like xpdf does.
18:42  stepnem: I guess it must be feasible, as at least kpdf does it.
18:42  stepnem: But I'm not gonna install KDE just to view PDFs.
18:43  John-Galt: Yeah, RV is trivial enough. I've got 2 or 3 "Vim-like" PDF viewers... they might do those things, but I never use them...
18:44  stepnem: (kpdf does arbitraryish customisation IIRC)
18:45  stepnem: Last time I tried I wasn't able to find any other decent viewer that did that (rv at least).
18:45  John-Galt: Well, you could try apvlv or zathura. I know at least one of them has marks.
18:52  stepnem: Ha! Zathura does list "Invertable colors" now! Yay!
