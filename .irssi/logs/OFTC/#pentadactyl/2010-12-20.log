00:16  graffatcolmingov: stepnem: can you delete issue 196? 
00:42  thesnowdog: graffatcolmingov: Done
00:52  graffatcolmingov: thanks thesnowdog 
02:37  graffatcolmingov: fyi 197 and 195 are identical almost, but 197 has more details so you can merge it into 197

06:39  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * eccab84bf345ae1cc6f6b2d927657505b67fbbe5 /common/content/hints.js Don't try to delete elem.dactylHighlight in hints. Closes issue #195.
06:56  John-Galt: Wow... This is a complete ripoff of my Unfuck Google Code plugin, which I suppose would be fine, except that even the name is a ripoff.
06:56  John-Galt: https://github.com/mooz/keysnail/raw/master/plugins/unfuck-your-enemies.ks.js
06:58  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Perhaps it's more of a tribute.
06:59  John-Galt: Not likely.
07:00 * John-Galt has a hard time respeting people who can't even come up with their own bug fixes.
07:03  thesnowdog: Hmmm, snowing at home in the heart of summer.  Climate change, climate change.
07:03 * thesnowdog runs around hysterically
07:05  thesnowdog: Writing your own bug fix just for the sake of it if one is readily available seems odd.
07:06 * thesnowdog ponders how many ways to fix a bug
07:06  thesnowdog: ...pondering hurts.
07:07  John-Galt: Probably quite a lot, actually, and some are better and/or more interesting than others. Copying bug fixes from other people prevents code bases from diverging as they rightly should.
07:08  John-Galt: Barriers to gene transfer are the basis of evolution, so it goes.
07:10  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I think stepnem wants to know what you did to offend Asia. :P
07:10 * thesnowdog is sweet so couldn't have been him

10:09  John-Galt: Has anyone else noticed that svn is complete, utter, and total crap?
10:15  John-Galt: I don't think it would be so bad if it were just a little bit crap, but it really has no redeaming qualities at all, and yet quite a lot of utterly flabergasting idiotic misfeatures.
10:26  patrick85: "Subversion has been the most pointless project ever started... Subversion used to say, 'CVS done right.' With that slogan there is nowhere you can go. There is no way to do CVS right." ^^

11:22  oeuftete: I'm getting things like "Processing TabOpen event: TypeError: img is null" with the latest nightly when opening new tabs... known?
11:23  John-Galt: Yes. That's what you get for using 3.6...
11:23  oeuftete: Shame on me for using stable Firefox
11:24  John-Galt: That's an oxymoron.
11:24  John-Galt: At any rate, the 4.0 betas are more stable than 3.6 in a lot of ways, and a lot faster all over.
11:25  oeuftete: ok
11:25  John-Galt: But, then again, you're using dactyl nightlies...
11:25  John-Galt: At any rate, the bug's fixed. It'll be fine in tomorrow's nightly.
11:26  oeuftete: yes, I'll buy that using the older supported FF with a nightly-built extension, I am asking for things like this.  Good to know that it's fixed, and it's probably time to think about moving to 4.0

11:56  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Is buying beer every day a task you engage in simply to spend time with the beer sales girl?  It seems rather inefficient otherwise.
11:56  thesnowdog: Surely beer can be bought for the month at least.
11:57  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Not every day. I haven't bought any beer in two weeks now because I keep forgetting to go until it's too late.
11:58  John-Galt: And, at any rate, if I were that badly smitten, I'd just ask her out. Or get a job at the store or something.
11:58 * John-Galt is not the stalker type.
12:02  John-Galt: Hm. 4XSLT apparently sucks... When it's supposed to be processing the @href atribute it's instead processing the @style attribute...
12:02  John-Galt: Lame.
12:25  John-Galt: Anyone have a good (light background) Vim or \blasphemy{Emacs} color scheme that'd be good for help pages and MOW output?
13:53  John-Galt: Oh, my. The Daily Mail's actually printed something sensible.
14:01  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Do you not test on FF 3? I ask because I'm happy to give your commits a run on it if you can't be bothered at least while I'm not doing anything else useful. :)
14:04  John-Galt: thesnowdog: I do test on FF3, actually, but not often.
14:04  John-Galt: At least, I know that it broke tab numbers before people started complaining, but I didn't immediately realize that it broke things even for people with them turned off.
14:04  John-Galt: s/know/knew/
15:16  rogutes: John-Galt: "187: A bug in searching" happens pretty often here. Currently, I have a tab open which consistently says 'TypeError: this.range is undefined' on lines 397 and 534 of finder.js
15:18  John-Galt: Can you tell me how to reproduce it consistently? And with which :version ?
15:19  rogutes: Unfortuantely, I can't reproduce it 
15:19  rogutes: sometimes /finding just dies in a tab
15:20  rogutes: it's FF4.0b8 and Pentadactyl tip
15:22  John-Galt: Well, I've come across other errors. Never that one.
15:24  rogutes: hm... actually, I can reproduce it in a similar way to what I described yesterday
15:24  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 2a7ed43c1dd74df5808bda6336b7f0f59dab121c /common/ (content/dactyl.js modules/styles.jsm) Fix an odd :style completion bug.
15:24  rogutes: I just ran firefox -pentadactyl '+u NONE' (empty session)
15:25  John-Galt: Ah, peace: :sty -n google-no-preview http://www.google.com/search?* #vspb { display: none !important; }
15:25  John-Galt: rogutes: What did you describe yesterday?
15:26  rogutes: this: :o g<CR>/go<CR><CR>n
15:26  John-Galt: But I just fixed that.
15:27  rogutes: let's see...
15:28  rogutes: I'm pretty certain that this is the latest pentadactyl-hg
15:28  John-Galt: Well, it works for me.
15:29  rogutes: Well, unfortunately :)
15:34  rogutes: John-Galt: same with firefox-4.0b9pre nightly (except that on a clean profile, it would be :o google<CR>/go<CR><CR>n)
15:36  John-Galt: Works for me.
15:46  iaj: what did incsearch,hlsearch got replaced with?
15:46  rogutes: iaj: search -> find
15:46  John-Galt: incfind/hlfind, which is of course mentioned in NEWS.
15:47  iaj: i crawled through the logs :\
15:47  John-Galt: hg log -p pentadactyl/NEWS
15:49  iaj: Ahwww. thanks :< there it is
16:03 * John-Galt recons we ought to just not bind <Tab>

16:52  hiptobecubic: What on earth happened to the status bar UI in the latest few revisions?
16:52  John-Galt: Hm?
16:55  hiptobecubic: John-Galt, hold on, uploading screenshot
16:55  hiptobecubic: my uplink here is something on the order 10KB/s...
16:55  John-Galt: hiptobecubic: Don't bother. It's your colorscheme.
16:56  hiptobecubic: Pink with a different font is because I have a grey colorscheme?
16:56  hiptobecubic: Also, it only happens on Gmail so far. Most other pages are the usual white on black
16:57  hiptobecubic: the little borders around the icons on the right are pretty ugly and new also.
16:57  John-Galt: Pink, huh? Well, at any rate, yes, because it probably overrides the current value of StatusLine rather than appending to it, and since some values from dactyl.css were moved to StatusLine that means you wind up with the 'statusbar' appearence.
16:57  hiptobecubic: Is there a way to get the reasonable looking one back? Or am i stuck with this http://imgur.com/Ps0hi.png
16:58  John-Galt: Yes, just use :hi -a instead of :hi
16:59  hiptobecubic: John-Galt, i wasn't use :hi at all. Where is this used?
17:00  John-Galt: Are you using a colorscheme?
17:00  hiptobecubic: Not that i'm aware of?
17:00  hiptobecubic: I thought you meant my gtk theme
17:01  John-Galt: Can you post your .pentadactylrc?
17:01  John-Galt: And what's your :version ?
17:01  hiptobecubic: John-Galt, http://vpaste.net/e9U47
17:02  John-Galt: :version ?
17:03  hiptobecubic: [Command Line]: 1: ReferenceError: version is not defined
17:04  hiptobecubic: errr... guess that doesn't work anymore :)  hold on

17:04  John-Galt: There's something seriously wrong on your end, then.
17:04  hiptobecubic: ":yank version" gave me undefined. :version worked as you see it.
17:04  John-Galt: Well, yeah, you'd have to use :yank :version
17:05  John-Galt: Try hg4977
17:06  hiptobecubic: oh sorry. My fault :)
17:07  hiptobecubic: where is that?
17:07  hiptobecubic: i see nightlies on the googlecode page...
17:07  John-Galt: You have to run from the repo or build your own.
17:08  hiptobecubic: Cloning....

17:16  hiptobecubic: What are melo and telo dactyl?
17:16  John-Galt: Add-ons for Songbird and some prefix that you've apparently made up.
17:17  hiptobecubic: oh sorry, tele
17:17  hiptobecubic: ;)
17:17  John-Galt: In that case, an add-on for Thunderbird.
17:17  hiptobecubic: ah
17:20  hiptobecubic: John-Galt, 4977 fixes the ugly border around the icons, but gmail still looks strange. Blue instead of pink at least
17:22  John-Galt: Well, it's supposed to look blue. All SSL pages are. What does it normally look like?
17:27 --- thrope_ is now known as thrope
17:31  iaj: is the tab-key kinda bugged in current nightlies?
17:31  iaj: i can't tab over from one input field to another :)
17:31  John-Galt: Yes, but it's fixed.
17:32  iaj: really? when? I pulled 15 mins ago
17:33  John-Galt: Oh, interesting, unbinding <Tab> doesn't fix it...
17:34  John-Galt: We must do something else that breaks <Tab>, which is probably moveFocus was failing, anyway. I thought that was strange given that's how <Tab> is implimented.
17:34  iaj: :-) sorry for those bad news :(
17:35  John-Galt: Ah... StatusLine doesn't apply when StatusLineSecure is applied. I should have thought of that.
17:37  hiptobecubic: John-Galt, ah, perhaps it's usually blue, but the icons on the left are on blue as well, then. Not grey like the rest of the ui. The are part of the statusline afterall
17:38  John-Galt: Yeah, I need to make some changes.
17:52  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 93c7cddae66c87230643b8e2669e0697991727d7 /common/content/ (configbase.js statusline.js) Fix StatusLine highlighting.
17:58  oeuftete: should ":hi Search color: green" make the highlighted searches green (with hlfind on)?  It's doing nothing for me
17:59  John-Ga1t: Nope.
17:59  John-Ga1t: It actually should give an error. I'll have to fix that.
18:00  oeuftete: So how should I be restyling the found results?
18:00  John-Ga1t: You can't.
18:03 --- John-Ga1t is now known as John-Galt
18:11  oeuftete: ok, I was misled by the help on :hi
18:12  John-Galt: Is the group still listed? It should have been removed when we switched to using selections rather than DOM manipulation.
18:13  oeuftete: and I did move to FF 4.0b7 per discussion earlier, and my ~/_pentadactylrc doesn't seem to be read now, which I'm trying to figure out
18:13  oeuftete: yes, the Search group is listed
18:13  oeuftete: :version
18:13  oeuftete: Pentadactyl hg4966 (created: 2010/12/20 01:00:16) running on:

18:14  John-Galt: Ugh. Windows users. It's fixed in tip, at any rate.
18:19  oeuftete: the presence of Search in that list you mean?   And so, there is no mechanism currently to change the search result highlighting from its current magenta setting?
18:19  John-Galt: No, the rc loading bug.
18:19  oeuftete: oh ok, great
18:22  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 0fa4f4de84c86a961c633d50b8322e788ea511c1 /common/content/ (events.js modes.js) Fix <Tab>.
18:24  hiptobecubic: i assume CIA-9 is the update bot?
18:25  John-Galt: Yes.
