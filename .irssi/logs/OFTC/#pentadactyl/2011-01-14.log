16:36  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: that go+=n/N email is probably 3.6.x. I just tried out my go options with 3.6.12 and it bjorked the browser (rev 5299)
16:36  John-Galt: Oh, they're supposed to be disabled on 3.x.
16:36  John-Galt: Oh, nevermind, I re-enabled the binding, didn't I?
16:37  graffatcolmingov: Guess you did
16:37 * graffatcolmingov shrugs
16:37  graffatcolmingov: Hope that helps
17:15  tlonim: nszipwriter is used by addons right ?
17:17  John-Galt: Yes.
17:17  John-Galt: Although Firefox will probably crash if you try to use it from the command-line.
17:21  tlonim: ah..
17:22  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, firefox now provides the omnijar format for its chrome files ..tried that ?
17:22  tlonim: it supposedly makes startup fast
17:24  tlonim: also looks like firefox supports cairo-qt too as backend
17:28  John-Galt: tlonim: Yeah, omni jar is the default now.
17:29  graffatcolmingov: omni jar = firefox thing where app tabs usually are?
17:29  tlonim: graffatcolmingov: no..the packaging
17:30  graffatcolmingov: ah
17:30  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: No, all of the chrome files and JS components for the base are now in a single jar.
17:30  John-Galt: Also, extension XPIs are generally no longer unjarred, which is part of the same project.
17:32 * John-Galt needs to go walk for an hour or so...
17:32  graffatcolmingov: Enjoy
17:51  tlonim: John-Galt: getting http://sprunge.us/CWfJ error 
17:52  tlonim: i ran purgecaches too
17:52  tlonim: also seeing 
17:52  tlonim: "pentadactyl: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH) [nsILocalFile.initWithPath]"  nsresult: "0x80520001 (NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH)"  location: "JS frame :: resource://dactyl-424un3m61/storage.jsm :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 285"  data: no]"
17:53  graffatcolmingov: o__O?
17:54  tlonim: hmm.. reinstalling same addon seems to have fixed it
17:55  tlonim: i mean same addon without any updates.. i rebuilt firefox before, may be something changed wrt firefox handling
17:56  tlonim: no..wait. getting that error (the one in sprunge paste)
17:56  tlonim: also about unrecognized path
18:59  John-Galt: Eh. Weird.
19:00  John-Galt: Works for me.
19:03  tlonim: John-Galt: you are not getting those errors ?
19:06  John-Galt: Nope.
19:17  John-Galt: “Pat Robertson: Snow Is God's Way of Punishing Americans Planning To Drive To Do Something Gay”
19:18  John-Galt: I love Pat Robertson. Nothing like pure deadpan.
19:43  stepnem: Why do I always get the menu bar on start now? :-(
19:46  John-Galt: You don't?
19:46  stepnem: I do.
19:46  John-Galt: Interesting.
19:46  John-Galt: I don't.
19:46  John-Galt: I get a horrid "Minefield" button, though.
19:47  stepnem: Although it's not in go.
19:47  John-Galt: Yeah, I don't even get one in b8.
19:47  John-Galt: Tried '+u NONE' ?
19:47  stepnem: Yep. Same thing.
19:48  John-Galt: Ah. I get one in b7.
19:48  stepnem: Right, that's what I'm using.
19:48  John-Galt: Which I don't care about, because I'm not supporting b7 anymore.
19:48  stepnem: Great.
19:49  John-Galt: Supporting 3.x is enough hassle. Betas are meant to be short lived. Users know what they're getting into. We're at b9. I don't care about b7 anymore. I'd go insane trying to support b5 or b6.
19:50  stepnem: Sure. I understand that, sir.
19:50  John-Galt: Heh
