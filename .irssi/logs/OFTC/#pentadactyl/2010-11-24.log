00:01  thesnowdog: estragib: Well it's the only way to be sure I guess.
00:03  estragib: my thinking exactly
00:31  John-Galt: We have quite a stock of ICBMs over here, for what it's worth.
00:31  estragib: how do we get thew into orbit?
00:32  estragib: s/w/m
00:33  John-Galt: Rockets.
00:33  estragib: it's a plan then
03:02 --- estragib_ is now known as estragib
03:56  zeltak: evening guys. i have a question. when i press C-Z in for example greader and leave the tab for another when i go back the passthrough is gone. is there way to make passthrough 'stick' on a specific tab?
04:37  John-Galt: No, but you can use a LocationChange autocmd.
04:39  John-Galt: The institution of royalty in any form is an insult to the human race. --Mark Twain
04:56  thesnowdog: I'm going to have to go with stepnem on that one and say "yeah, real words of wisdom there"
04:56  stepnem: well, I like the one about school better ;-)
04:59  thesnowdog: stepnem: So meat overalls are some sort of national dress?
04:59 * John-Galt has completely lost the thread
05:00  stepnem: This one sounds like Twain had rather strange ideas about dignity of human race. I'm not sure the fact he missed both world wars is much of an extenuating circumstance...
05:01  John-Galt: You really should read more Mark Twain...
05:01  stepnem: thesnowdog: heh, meat overalls? What are you talking about?
05:01  thesnowdog: Personally I'd prefer to take my chances with the bear: http://tinyurl.com/266vns3
05:02  thesnowdog: stepnem: It's good to know your bubble is well sealed. :P
05:02  stepnem: ah, some contemporaria...?
05:04  John-Galt: As is mine. I only have a vague idea that someone called 'Lady Gaga' exists, and is probably some kind of singer. I'd never heard of this meat suit before.
05:05  stepnem: roast beefs :-)
05:06  stepnem: thesnowdog: you must be really bored, right?
05:06  thesnowdog: o_O
05:06  thesnowdog: No, but I'm not a social outcast so I here of the current water cooler topics.
05:06  thesnowdog: hear*
05:07  thesnowdog: ...not much I can do about it.  Don't hate me.
05:07  stepnem: BTW, the house I live in is going to be for sale, any takers?
05:07  John-Galt: You need to work on your leer, then.
05:07  thesnowdog: John-Galt: In my earlier years I was a master, but age brings understanding.
05:08  John-Galt: Understanding of cheezy pop culture? Don't want it.
05:12  thesnowdog: stepnem: Is the "house I live in" your parents?
05:12  thesnowdog: ...have to finally done away with them?
05:12  thesnowdog: s/to/you/
05:12  stepnem: thesnowdog: well as I said it's a bit more complicated; the actual details are still unclear to me, but they're going to sell it
05:13  thesnowdog: stepnem: I take it you don't converse with them either? ;-)
05:13  stepnem: allegedly the on-paper owner is my sister
05:14  stepnem: thesnowdog: it's only my mother and her partner who lived here; but yeah, conversation is not too developed in our family
05:16  thesnowdog: So where are you going to dwell?
05:16  stepnem: no idea
05:17  stepnem: there's still some time
05:17 * thesnowdog watches E
05:17  thesnowdog: You're not going to have to get a job are you? :(
05:18  stepnem: well, sooner or later I am
05:18  thesnowdog: I recommend taking to the National Park: http://www.galleryone.com/images/callep/callep_-_mountain_man_the.JPG
05:20  stepnem: best would be to get a nice job with a house, like a lighthouse watcher or something
05:20 * thesnowdog cracks up
05:20  stepnem: too bad we don't have any lighthouses here... I guess they're all computer-controlled these days anyway
05:23  thesnowdog: I recommend Bell Rock stepnem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchcape
05:25  stepnem: looks like fun; I'm not opposed to working abroad
06:39  thesnowdog: stepnem: What can you do?
06:41  thesnowdog: There's lots of jobs in mining over in WA.  :)
06:41  thesnowdog: Western Australia
06:42  stepnem: heh
06:43  thesnowdog: You could return straight to your quarters afterwards if you want to avoid the post work pub culture.
06:44  thesnowdog: ...might even be some tranlation work with those companies given they ship most of their product to China.
06:47  stepnem: yeah, well... it's hard to plan future when your biggest wish is ceasing to exist ;-)
06:47  stepnem: I guess I'll let my inertia handle that, as usual
06:48  thesnowdog: stepnem: You could easily cease to exist by marching into one of those said pubs 2 hours after knock off time and calling some miner's manliness into question.
06:48  stepnem: :-D
06:50  thesnowdog: And now the 30 miners in NZ have been declared lost the vacancies can only increase with the pay.
06:50  thesnowdog: Oh, good now the press are shoving a microphone into the face of a ranting/grieving father - all class as usual.
07:08  John-Galt: I'm not above calling into question the manliness of miners, but I'm secure enough in my manliness to cheat in a fight.
