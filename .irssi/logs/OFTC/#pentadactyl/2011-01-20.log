09:13  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I don't see why not
09:14  John-Galt: Yeah, yeah...
09:14  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Is sleep on the agenda?
09:14 * thesnowdog is not convinced John-Galt is one man
09:15  John-Galt: I can't sleep. It sucks.
09:16  thesnowdog: And yet you're still making some sense.
09:16  John-Galt: Not for long I'm not.
09:16  thesnowdog: Do some exercise other than typing...
09:17  John-Galt: Would probably help. Of course, it's 03:00 here...
09:19  thesnowdog: Well that's my favourite walking time. :)
09:22  John-Galt: Yeah, but you don't have a bunch of crotchety overzealous sheriffs.
09:23  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I don't even know what that means.  Are you an escaped slave in Alabama?
09:24  tlonim: i guess walking at 3:00 wont be safe too 
09:25  John-Galt: Heh. As far as they care, I am.
09:25  thesnowdog: tlonim: Well not with all the lynchers I guess.
09:26  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Sounds like Mars to me.
09:26  tlonim: heh
09:26 * thesnowdog reconsiders any plans to ride around america
09:26  tlonim: ride in bike ?
09:26  tlonim: harleys ..
09:27  thesnowdog: Yes, but I guess all the town Sheriffs will try and 'run me out of town' or something o_O
09:27  thesnowdog: tlonim: Definitely not. ;-)
09:31  John-Galt: Yeah, you could get away with a Harley around here... not with the kind of bikes you ride.
09:32  thesnowdog: tlonim: Although I might if I go to http://www.sturgismotorcyclerally.com/ out of respect.

09:33  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Basically you're saying the Top Gear episode where they were stoned was real. :)
09:33  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Oh gods yes. Never go to Alabama.
09:34  John-Galt: They stage a lot of crap on Top Gear, but not that.
09:36  John-Galt: Hell, if I said "Oh gods yes" in Alabama I'd probably be lynched.
09:37  John-Galt: The state legislature actually voted to put disclaimers on Bio textbooks that mentioned evolution a few years ago.
09:37  John-Galt: It was miraculously overturned in court, thank the gods...
09:41  sp3ctum: doesn't scepticism go well with the times
09:44 * John-Galt is starting to hallucinate...
09:45  John-Galt: sp3ctum: That depends on what you mean by 'scepticism'. If you mean like global warming and moon landing sceptics, well...
09:45  sp3ctum: true
09:46  a13ph: hardcore sceptics are sceptical even about scepticism
09:49  John-Galt: Ugh. You should really look into the history of the word skeptic. It doesn't mean what most people think it means.
09:50  John-Galt: Argh, bug 78414 generates so damned much noise.
09:51  a13ph: uh.. sure, thx. maybe it's cultural difference (english isn't  my first language)
09:53  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Someone's pulled their donations. Oh no!
09:53 * thesnowdog likes a good bug report where people are addressed as "Buddy"
09:54 * thesnowdog goes to call someone buddy in the IPC bug thread
09:55  John-Galt: Heh
09:59  sp3ctum: what a13ph said sound more like cynicism to me
10:21 * John-Galt makes some tea.
10:37  tlonim: 78414 is the flash key handling one right ?
10:37  thesnowdog: ...more caffeine
10:38  John-Galt: It's decaf.
10:38  thesnowdog: yes
10:38  tlonim: the Alabama Top Gear one was lol
10:38  thesnowdog: ugh
10:38  tlonim: "Nascars suck" 
10:38  John-Galt: bug 78414
10:38  John-Galt: "Man love rules"
10:38  John-Galt: eris_prime: bug 78414
10:38  John-Galt: I don't know what's up with her lately...
10:38  tlonim: the bug is open since 2001
10:38  thesnowdog: lack of sleep
10:38  tlonim: mozilla loves long bugs i guess
10:42  John-Galt: bug 78414
10:42  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bmo/78414 joshmoz, NEW, , --, Application shortcut keys (keyboard commands such as f11, ctrl+t, ctrl+r) fail to operate when plug-in (flash, acrobat, quicktime) has focus
10:42  John-Galt: There goes.
10:42  John-Galt: Path troubles.
10:44  thesnowdog: John-Galt: What commands does eris_prime understand?
10:45  thesnowdog: tlonim: I've long held a suspicion that the latter day Netscape project managers somehow still run the show.
10:45  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Depends on her mood apparently.
10:46  tlonim: thesnowdog: also may be that mozilla doesn't care much about keyboard only folks..
10:46  tlonim: most of their users may not be using shortcuts at all 
10:46  John-Galt: Although, overall: faq, plugin, nightly, xpi, nightlies, quote, kick, topic, mode, bug
10:46  tlonim: it seems google chrome has fixed it somehow
10:46  thesnowdog: Hmmm, Steve Tyler on Idol?  I guess we should expect that after the Armageddon song
10:46  tlonim: also it would be nice if adobe introduced a pass through key to flash 
10:46  tlonim: that would be awesome
10:47  tlonim: but i doubt they would
10:47  John-Galt: eris_prime: quote
10:47  John-Galt: See. Depends on her mood. :(
10:47  tlonim: is it a supybot ?
10:47  John-Galt: I ought to just rewrite her in Python.
10:50  John-Galt: Ah, right, I'd forgotten about that... Stupid bloody plumbing issues.
10:50  John-Galt: eris_prime: quote
10:50  eris_prime: John-Galt: Every one is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody. --Mark Twain
10:53  thesnowdog: eris_prime: quote
10:53  eris_prime: thesnowdog: The wireless telegraph is not difficult to understand. The ordinary telegraph is like a very long cat. You pull the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angeles. The wireless is the same, only without the cat. --Albert Einstein
10:54 * thesnowdog resists the urge to bang away at eris_prime
10:54  John-Galt: Heh
10:56  tlonim: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-78414-firefox-flash/index.html looks interesting .. but i think it does a xdotool on the firefox window 
10:58  John-Galt: It's garbage.
10:59  John-Galt: If you want something like that there's fix-focus.js.
10:59  John-Galt: It used to be possible without such hacks, but no more on 4.x. :(
10:59  tlonim: oh..that plugin works on firefox 4 ? 
11:00  tlonim: i think on my home firefox i have applied the last patch in 78414 bug
11:00  tlonim: works moderately i think
11:01  stepnem: John-Galt: Are these errors about missing catalogs ignorable? http://pastebin.com/mqbvYxyU
11:04  John-Galt: tlonim: It *only* works on Firefox 4.
11:04  tlonim: John-Galt: cool. will check
11:05  thesnowdog: John-Galt: /123 playing up for you?
11:05  John-Galt: stepnem: Interesting... I don't think they mean anything, but I'll look.
11:06  John-Galt: /123?
11:06  thesnowdog: Searching for digits
11:06  thesnowdog: Err, finding
11:06  John-Galt: Nah, works fine.
11:06  John-Galt: Until I hit <BS>...
11:07  tlonim: when using /<number>
11:07  tlonim: why does number not appear
11:07  tlonim: it shows up on RHS
11:07  John-Galt: Go away.
11:07  tlonim: it doesnt work 
11:07  tlonim: hmm
11:07  tlonim: let me try latest nightly
11:08  thesnowdog:  /123 return seems to enter an infinite loop of inserted "123" for me. :P
11:08  John-Galt: Yeah, once you hit a non-number key.
11:10  stepnem: Speaking about search, does search for anybody here work in text areas?
11:12  stepnem: E.g., I can't get the text in the Google search field highlighted or anything using /
11:12  thesnowdog: stepnem: I hope not.
11:12  thesnowdog: ...but I didn't disable it.
11:13  stepnem: "Hope"? You people are crazy. It used to work. :-(
11:14  thesnowdog: My understanding is that it was essentially considered a bug in FF anyway.
11:14  John-Galt: stepnem: It still bloody *does* work.
11:15  John-Galt: Except that it no longer moves the caret to the input field, because that would be stupid.
11:15  stepnem: John-Galt: Well it still blody doesn't for me.
11:15  thesnowdog: stepnem: I was just about to ask why I had become a plural...
11:15  John-Galt: No need to use that kind of language. This is a family friendly zone.
11:16  stepnem: thesnowdog: Because John-Galt seems to find it about as useful as you do.
11:16  thesnowdog: He does have taste.

11:24  stepnem: Well, better Chibi than Python, goes without saying.
11:38  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I can barely stay awake these last few weeks.

11:46  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/280 ---, Fixed, Defect, Medium, unable to search numeric
11:46  John-Galt: stepnem: Yeah, there's some hack for visual line mode.
11:47  stepnem: Well, it doesn't seem to work; the Caret one at least.
11:47  John-Galt: No, it's only for Text Edit mode.
11:48  stepnem: I see.
11:51  stepnem: In any case, 'v' in Visual line mode should switch to characterwise, not turn it off...
11:51  John-Galt: Probably.
11:51  stepnem: Not that I've ever used it, it just caught my eye when looking at Doug's last fix.
11:51  CIA-6: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 39d56cb7bd739e7e483a783301880b53b3a2c468 /common/content/dactyl.js Apply modules prototype magic earlier. Closes issue #281.

11:52  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/280 ---, Fixed, Defect, Medium, unable to search numeric
11:52  stepnem: Maybe, but that's what happens.
11:53  John-Galt: Grr. Text Edit mode is all fscked.
11:56  tlonim: you folks use text mode or external editor mode more ?
11:56  tlonim: i prefer the latter for long posts
11:56  stepnem: I generally try to avoid the kind of situation either of those is needed altogether ;-)
11:57  tlonim: stepnem: no web 2.0 fan :)? 
11:57  stepnem: Rrrright...
11:59  John-Galt: I use <C-i>
12:04 * Monkey uses <C-i> and has sporadically and unsuccessfully lobbied for the removal of Text Edit mode

12:07 * John-Galt has sporadically and unsuccessfully lobbied for the removal of <Leader>
12:11  tlonim: oh.. no i use <leader>
12:11  tlonim: it is the way for me to be compatible with some of my vim keys 
12:12 * John-Galt has half a mind to remove the damned thing out of spite.
12:12  Monkey: I'd prefer multiple defineable <leader>s
12:12  tlonim: but since i dont change modes that often in dactyl
12:13  tlonim: then i think i can use any key as prefix
12:13  John-Galt: Monkey: I agree that would be less stupid.
12:24  tlonim: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2120773 interesting
12:48  stepnem: Well, if you want multiple defineable <leader>s, why not just provide a way to define arbitrary user macros; probably using some reserved prefix or something.
12:50  stepnem: I guess the equivalence between <key> and <macro> notation is only an infortunate accident, though...?

17:29  stepnem: Guest933: Some people seem to have some success using the passkeys option (:h 'passkeys).
17:30  stepnem: In the latest Penta there are now also site-specific mappings, using :mapgroup etc. 
17:31  stepnem: (I have no experience with either of them myself.)

20:25  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, the undo failing was because of something else.. turns out sessionstore is tied to that somehow
20:26  John-Galt: anon33_: It's an automatic update bug. I've turned automatic updates off and most of the update bugs I know about are fixed, but there may still be more.
20:26  John-Galt: I can only test every few days, though, once I have a cache of nightlies to test with.
20:28  John-Galt: tlonim: Yeah, that's not surprising.
20:28  John-Galt: stepnem: Do you get review emails?
21:38  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, I got this one. Before that I only got one or two of some announcement letters from AMO or something like that.
21:40  John-Galt: stepnem: Weird. They must have fixed that bug, then.
21:41  John-Galt: Used to be only listed devs got emails. Which meant that add-ons with no listed devs had not idea what was going on with their reviews.
21:41  John-Galt: I never got a review email for Vimperator either.
21:41  stepnem: John-Galt: What bug? As far as I can see, this mail was explicitely addressed to all of us three.
21:41  stepnem: Hm.
21:42  stepnem: Ah, I see the announcements were, too.

22:30  milant: also, any way to modify the ❤ symbol for bookmarked pages, either a different color or different symbol altogether?
22:46  John-Galt: milant: No on both counts at the moment.
22:47  milant: john-galt: sounds like a good opportunity for me to hack the code then :). is this located in common? or pentadactyl folder?
22:48  John-Galt: common/content/statusline.js and common/modules/finder.jsm
22:48  milant: is anyone using an irc in ffox? does pentadactyl have integration with it?

22:54  milant: mibbit is built into the browser, so i'll try that out and see whether i make it to hell and back....
22:55  John-Galt: No it's not.
22:56  John-Galt: That reminds me of all those people a few years back who were up in arms that Windows had an obscene easter egg that was triggered by typing some cryptic command starting with "telnet" into the Run Command window.
22:57  milant: no? i mean pentadactyl works while it is open. hmmm, i'll take a look at it more then.
22:57  John-Galt: milant: It's just a web site.
22:57  John-Galt: It's like saying Gmail is built into the browser.
22:58  milant: john-gait: obscene? or obscure? :)
