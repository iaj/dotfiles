00:00  stepnem: ctruett: :h gi
00:28  stepnem: I want an Emacs written in a curried Scheme. PLEASE!
00:31  John-Galt: Well, that's a bit less stress, anyway.
00:37  stepnem: John-Galt: I noticed that search now seems to ignore text fields. Is that intentional? I wonder if that's what "Input boxes are not focused when matches are highlighted." in NEWS indicates; but it sucks, and the matches inside text areas are actually not even highlighted.
00:38  John-Galt: stepnem: No, I think that Firefox possibly broke the finder to ignore text boxes.
00:38  John-Galt: Although I've never seen the point of searching the contents of text boxes, personally.
00:39  John-Galt: stepnem: Oh, nevermind. It works as expected for me.
00:39  stepnem: It's occasionally useful even for just focusing the box, let alone cases with large text areas full of ... erm, text.
00:39  John-Galt: Although, come to think of it, it should update buffer.lastInputField so gi focuses the input field in question.
00:40  John-Galt: Yeah, might make more sense for text areas. Auto-focusing it is not an option. It makes n unexpectedly replace the selected text in text boxes rather than find the next occurance too often.
00:42  stepnem: Hm. Well I would expect that 'n' should take me there just like any other match, and then pressing <CR> would actually enter the field.
00:43  stepnem: In any case, now I don't even get the highlighting...
00:43  John-Galt: Don't see why you'd expect <CR> to do that. Anyway, like I said, it works for me.
00:43  John-Galt: Where doesn't it work for you?
00:43  stepnem: Well, just the same as pressing <CR> anywhere else.
00:44  stepnem: You have to press Enter to stay where you get to using n.
00:44  John-Galt: It doesn't do much of anything most other places.
00:44  stepnem: Seems like a pretty sense-making expectation to me.
00:45  stepnem: John-Galt: Anywhere.
00:45  John-Galt: Don't know what to say, then. Update Firefox, I guess.
00:45  stepnem: It just doesn't work in any text area I tried.

01:36  zeltak: evening all
01:55  John-Galt: Yay for hormones and pheromones. Things are so much easier in person.
01:58 * John-Galt could do with a run.
01:59  John-Galt: If only the bastard cops around here didn't think there was something unsavory about running after dark.
02:16  John-Galt: If you guys can get your hands on Sierra Nevada's Celebration IPA, I highly recommend it. Well, if you like hops.
02:16  John-Galt: Just don't drink it at refrigerator temperature.

02:26  John-Galt: Oh, praise the lord.

03:06  John-Galt: Wasn't there a bug I was supposed to be fixing earlier?
04:24  John-Galt: "Tide goes in, tide goes out. Never a miscommunication. *You* can't explain that."
05:09  thesnowdog:  John-Galt: I'm disturbed that I think I know that quote.
05:15  John-Galt: thesnowdog: You probably do. It was Papa Bear O'Reilly.
05:26  John-Galt: Hmm... Google seems to think that 'elite' is a form of 'elide' :(
05:29  thesnowdog: Ah, that's right. I recall the atheist bloke did a very poor job of addressing it too.
05:30  thesnowdog: John-Galt: So they're blaiming Palin and her military metaphors for Arizona now? Hmmm
05:30  John-Galt: He certainly looked at him funny. But it's apparently a claim he's made many, many times. To Dawkins once, even.
05:31  John-Galt: I didn't see the AA interview, though. Just Colbert's treatment of it, because I heard he had Neil DeGrasse Tyson on.
05:31  thesnowdog: Sure, sometimes a funny look is all I can muster too. :)
05:31  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Some people are. A lot of other people are getting pissy that some people are.
05:32  John-Galt: Doesn't make Palin any less of a loon. Or the fact that any schmuck can walk into a gun store and buy an automatic assault weapon in Arizona any less absurd.
05:33  John-Galt: Still, you've got to admit that Palin and her cohort have been using absurdly milatiristic language. And they did put out a map with a gun sight on the woman who got shot. Which probably has nothing at all to do with the shooting.
05:33  John-Galt: But people don't deal well with coincidences...
05:35  John-Galt: As much as I hate statistics, because I can't think of it as real maths, I really thing they should start beating it into kids' heads by kindergarten.
05:36  peth: in my personal opinion, that would make the world even more unbearable than it already is
05:38  John-Galt: What, people having a basic understanding of statistics, rather than being completely and utterly ignorant of the extremely high likelihood of extremely unlikely events happening very often?
05:41  peth: well, i'm a principles kind of guy. and the pseudo-scientific understanding of statistics that would amount to would stand in stark contrast to principles. everything seems to be numbers nowadays. i'm not saying statistics are bad, or wrong, or anything. just that they are not much use if the epistemological framework of those who try to understand them isn't, uh, fit
05:41  peth: i'll stop talking until i'm sobererer
05:46  John-Galt: I don't think the world would be better if there were more statisticians in it, but there's a difference between understanding the basic principles of a science and a pseudo-scientific understanding of it.
05:47  John-Galt: Heh. Although I can understand having to shut up until you're sober. :)
05:48  peth: well, so long as we're not more familiar that is and everything i say will weigh highly in my initial etc
05:48  peth: so, good night. :)
05:49  John-Galt: G'night.
05:50  John-Galt: I just realized the other night that an Incubus song makes reference to Uri Geller. In a positive sort of way. :(
05:50  John-Galt: I can never listen to Incubus again.
05:50  peth: isn't that the fork-bending guy?
05:50  John-Galt: Yep.
05:51  peth: well, nice trick that
05:51  John-Galt: It's a decent trick when you don't pretend it's otherwise.
05:52  John-Galt: I donno. If you put Uri Gellar next to images of nebulas, there's something wrong with you.
05:54  peth: he is kind of nebulous
05:54  peth: was?
05:55  John-Galt: Is. Sadly.
05:58  peth: i see six million people watched his 2004 "comeback" :/
05:58  peth: anyway, fuck him. irrelevant.
05:59  John-Galt: Yeah, I'm just upset that he ruined a decent band for me, is all.
06:01  John-Galt: Oh. I need to sleep. 'night.
06:01  peth: night!
06:34  tlonim: thesnowdog: some calamity in Brisbane you are seeing.. 
06:58  thesnowdog: John-Galt: "rhetoric... carries the weight of a lead bullet" o_O
06:58  thesnowdog: tlonim: Yes, with no end in sight...

08:52  iaj: someone happening to do TYPO3 editing in here?
08:52  iaj: :-D
09:41  stepnem: John-Galt: BTW, shouldn't 'map -b -m hints f F' and 'map -b -m hints F f' do what CJW wants? It appears to not work, though.
09:47  stepnem: Heh, I see I didn't scare GaussFrank away yesterday. So now we're being more specific: "Bug with j, k, CTRL-D", great.
09:53  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Is there some way to hook into that notification system so we could present them via our message system?  And what is the doorknocker system?

10:34  dr_spork: Hi, I'm having trouble getting Pentadactyl to work on Minefield 4beta9. 
10:34  dr_spork: I've tried everything I can think to do: disabling/reenabling it, deleting extensions.* from my profile folder
10:35  dr_spork: Strangely, the addons screen in Minefield says it's enabled, but nothing works and the UI hasn't changed
10:46  thesnowdog: dr_spork: Have you tried a fresh profile?
10:46  dr_spork: I'm not sure how to do that, exactly
10:46  dr_spork: How do you get a fresh profile?
10:47  dr_spork: (just by deleting the profile folder?)
10:52  thesnowdog: firefox -ProfileManager
10:53  dr_spork: Just tried it with a new profile. Still having the same problem
10:58  thesnowdog: Have you tried b8?  Minefield is just that...
11:00  dr_spork: Just tried it in b8 downloaded from Mozilla's website, and it works. Pity it doesn't work in Minefield from the Daily PPA, though. 
11:00  thesnowdog: I assume you'd have mentioned any console errors?
11:00  thesnowdog: Oh, sorry missed your reply.
11:01  thesnowdog: It might work tomorrow. :)  I've lost track. John-Galt monitors Minefield I don't have the stomach for it.
11:02 * thesnowdog has no idea what a Daily PPA is
11:02  thesnowdog: Oh, something Ubuntuey
11:04  dr_spork: Here are the messages I've been getting when I run it in a terminal: http://pastebin.com/iUnV6JQ2
11:05  thesnowdog: Minefield you mean?  Are you running Pentadactyl tip?
11:05  dr_spork: (I'd gotten Minefield from here btw: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa)
11:06  thesnowdog: Those should be fixed in tip.
11:07  dr_spork: Cool

13:38  aksr: in command mode
13:42  stepnem: aksr: :h :ca
13:57  aksr: stepnem: thank you, i already read this, but i used tab as completition key, not space
15:03  aksr: how to 'echo' Date() on status bar always ?

16:40  aksr: next "]]" isn't working in facebook(for example pictures), "]]" opens site at the bottom of the page "Careers"
16:41  John-Galt: Too bad.
16:41 * graffatcolmingov feigns surprise
16:42  aksr: John-Galt: :)
16:42  stepnem: Hm, I thought John-Galt has fixed that.
16:44  aksr: stepnem: I'm using ff3 and 1.0b4.3
16:44  John-Galt: Why would I have fixed it? ]] has always been a crap shoot.
16:45  aksr: I don't know, but it is (for me) very useful
16:45  John-Galt: Sure. It's a useful crap shoot.
16:46  graffatcolmingov: he
16:49  stepnem: John-Galt: http://pastebin.com/vUcUiA6G
16:49  stepnem: (5th Oct)
16:50  John-Galt: Yep. Never said I'd fixed it, though.
16:50  stepnem: I don't use FB, but this is kinda a famous bug already.
16:51 * John-Galt is all for frustrating Facebook users...
16:51  graffatcolmingov: heh
16:51  John-Galt: Fine. I'll do something about it. ;(
16:51  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: have you seen this? http://www.dvorak.org/blog/2011/01/10/pepsi-drank-the-koolaid/
16:52 * John-Galt is not a fan of Dvorak...
16:52  John-Galt: Well, Dvo≈ô√°k is alright...
16:53  stepnem: :-)
16:53  graffatcolmingov: heh
16:53  graffatcolmingov: Well just the video
16:55  aksr: John-Galt: Conkeror`s "]]" works fine in this case..
16:55  John-Galt: Hm. Well, on the one hand, I hate soda with a passion. On the other hand, anything that sends the Vatican into convulsions is alright by me.
16:55  John-Galt: aksr: Well, that's a bug on their part, then. They're missing a perfactly good opportunity to piss off Facebook users.
16:56  aksr: John-Galt: You don't have account on facebook ?
16:56  John-Galt: I do, I just don't use it.
17:05 * thesnowdog is all for sabotaging FB usage
17:05 * thesnowdog things it would be a nice easter egg
17:06  tlonim: or troll by creating a facebook pentadactyl page :D
17:06  thesnowdog: tlonim: Ugh, there's a Vimperator community on FB so I hear
17:07 * thesnowdog is not sure exactly what that means but...
17:08  tlonim: oh.. 
17:09 * John-Galt is afraid our next beta will never be approved. :(
17:10  John-Galt: Andrew's scared of directory names changing and refuses to "learn Mercurial" so he can look at the diff. Andreas probably still thinks it's a Jetpack add-on...
17:10  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: admin didn't realize how bullshit the othe rmod was?
17:10  John-Galt: I suppose Jorge might get around to it at some point.
17:11  stepnem: Mabbe the AMO peopler are bribed by MS. ;-)
17:11  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: No, I got the flag removed.
17:11  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Have you asked for it to be reviewed? Throw your new found hefty weight around even if it's just a figment of my imagination.
17:11  John-Galt: stepnem: Not likely. Although... I get to review Vimperator updates... :) Should be fun.
17:11  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Tried. They don't care.
17:12  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Really? I thought that would fall under conflict of interest? 
17:12  stepnem: John-Galt: I don't think so, you're still a dev.
17:12  stepnem: Yeah.
17:12  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Throw a tanty and threaten to resign your post.
17:12  John-Galt: stepnem: No, I'm not an "owner", so I get to review it.
17:12  John-Galt: Plus, I "unlisted" Doug and I.
17:13  stepnem: Heh, interesting.
17:13  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Heh. Tried that...
17:13  tlonim: so who is owner of this project ?
17:13  stepnem: I!
17:13  Rasi: chrome://dactyl/content/dactyl.js: 540: ReferenceError: namespaces is not defined

17:13  Rasi: how can i get rid of this error?
17:13  John-Galt: tlonim: I was talking about Vimperator.
17:14  John-Galt: Rasi: It's been fixed.
17:14  Rasi: ah
17:14  tlonim: John-Galt: ah.
17:30  graffatcolmingov: So now that the iPhone is coming to Verizon, I think I might have to change cell service providers... 
17:31  John-Galt: Why?
17:32  graffatcolmingov: It might be nice to be able to use my phone in NYC
17:32  John-Galt: I don't use an iPhone, and I'd never pay Verizon's prices.
17:33  graffatcolmingov: I don't either but Verizon has the best coverage where I live
17:35  thesnowdog: graffatcolmingov: You travel or you have coverage issues in NJ?
17:36  thesnowdog: "Where I live" would suggest the latter, sorry.
17:36  graffatcolmingov: I've good coverage in NJ, especially near my uni
17:37  graffatcolmingov: And when I have to go into the city, I have good coverage as well
17:37  graffatcolmingov: But I'm fairly certain that the number of iPhone users moving to Verizon, especially in my area of NJ is going to kill that coverage
17:38  thesnowdog: It's just I always hear from friends about these coverage issues in US cities which seems a bit odd to the outsider.
17:38 * thesnowdog hates to think someone makes Telstra look good
17:38  John-Galt: It seems odd to me, too. I've never had any problems with T-Mobile.
17:38  graffatcolmingov: heh
17:38  John-Galt: (yay for German companies not fucking things up...)
17:38  graffatcolmingov: and I haven't had any problems with Verizon so far
17:39  graffatcolmingov: I've friends who have AT&T (not having the iPhone) who have terrible service though
17:42  thesnowdog: Hmmm, my sister was apparently laughing to a colleague, while following a car in New Hampshire, about the number plate/surround that said "Live Free or Die!" until he said: "Err, look at all the cars".
17:42  thesnowdog: Sorry, it's late and amused me too.
17:43  John-Galt: :)
17:44  graffatcolmingov: heh
17:44  stepnem: graffatcolmingov: BTW, what's so bad about NJ as compared to other states?
17:44  graffatcolmingov: I always liked N. Carolina's "First In Flight" because my first thought is always that they're the first to run away
17:44  John-Galt: stepnem: Nothing much.
17:45  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, graffatcolmingov said something rather different the other day, so I'd like to hear more from him on that topic.
17:45  graffatcolmingov: Besides our demagogue for a governor, highest (or 2nd highest) taxes in the US and one of the states with the highest amount of debt?
17:45  stepnem: I see.
17:45  John-Galt: That's because Jerseyites like to complain about Jersey.
17:45  stepnem: Hehe.
17:46  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Yeah, you guys elected a horrible governer... A Republican governer of New Jersey... Who'd have thought?
17:46  graffatcolmingov: Well when you're paying $10k on a cape with less than 100sqft of a yard then, yeah, you like to complain
17:46  thesnowdog: They get to wear guns up in NH too apparently. Seems appropriate.
17:46  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: just a governor of New Jersey is bad enough
17:47  graffatcolmingov: brb
18:01 * John-Galt wonders why liberator.open shouldn't be broken...
18:02  stepnem: Well, there's still the liberator dactyl alias.

18:13 * John-Galt glares at CIA-9
18:13  thesnowdog: Heh, our families property name is mentioned in the bible.
18:13  thesnowdog: family's
18:14  thesnowdog: stepnem: Heeeeeeeeeeelp me.
18:14  John-Galt: O.o
18:15  thesnowdog: Well they were apparently pretty religious back in the 1840's, those settler types. 
18:20  tlonim: Well I dont think vatican considered anything to East other than Japan/China and to the West of 'new world' a void because world was flat according to them. So no place for Australia :D
18:20  thesnowdog: Ooh, the hill up the back is really the "hill of testimony" or "mound of witness"
18:20  thesnowdog: I must spend more time up there but it's a bit of a hike.
18:20  John-Galt: tlonim: The Bible was written considerably before the time of the Vatican.
18:21  John-Galt: Not so much compiled, but written.
18:21  tlonim: John-Galt: how do you know they didn't edit it :P
18:21  John-Galt: They did. Lots of people have edited it.
18:21  tlonim: is New World mentioned  in Bible ?
18:21  tlonim: aka North America
18:22  stepnem: tlonim: Have you ever received some kind of history education?
18:22  tlonim: well..when they initially wrote it I guess world only knew about Orient and Europe and whatever in between
18:22  tlonim: stepnem: I am kidding :D
18:22  John-Galt: tlonim: It's not.
18:23  John-Galt: Even the Vikings didn't know about the Americas until I think the 11th century.
18:23  thesnowdog: tlonim: In the Book of Mormon, yes. :)
18:23  John-Galt: Granted, the "natives" knew about it some 10-15,000 years before that...
18:23  tlonim: and I don't think the native Indians try to cross the Atlantic either
18:24  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Ugh. I forgot about the Mormons. I don't think that counts as the Bible though.
18:24  tlonim: John-Galt: hmm.. natives in quotes because apparently many came  from Russia across the Bering strait ?
18:24  thesnowdog: John-Galt: No. But it's fun.
18:24  John-Galt: tlonim: They *all* did.
18:24  tlonim: John-Galt: hmm.oh. 
18:24  John-Galt: Heh
18:24  tlonim: really ? all ?
18:25  John-Galt: Yes.
18:25  tlonim: So who was there in that region before that ?
18:25  John-Galt: No-one. :)
18:25  tlonim: barren ?
18:25  tlonim: mmm
18:25  John-Galt: We're not a terribly old species. We all migrated out of Africa.
18:26  tlonim: John-Galt: well..I haven't read history of US but weren't one or two tribes originally from US ? atleast I thought so..
18:26  thesnowdog: ...and what of the coke snorting pharoahs?
18:26  tlonim: was watching "Dancing with the Wolves" other day
18:26  tlonim: nice movie
18:26  tlonim: felt sorry for the poor Indians in the end :(
18:27  John-Galt: tlonim: There were quite a lot of tribes. There may have been multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge (I'm not sure about that, but I think the concensus is one), but that's the way they all came.
18:27  tlonim: ok
18:27  John-Galt: The ones we call "native", anyway.
18:29  tlonim: but i refuse to believe all humans came from one single place
18:29  tlonim: the question being why that place ?
18:29 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 69103475cf4998c371e4c00ee3039fd252079b4b /common/modules/base.jsm Fix base.jsm:deprecated with null filenames. Closes issue #261.
18:29  eris_prime: Bug http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/261 ---, Fixed, Defect, Medium, liberator.open is broken: base.jsm: 275: TypeError: frame.filename is null
18:29  John-Galt: Wth?
18:29  John-Galt: tlonim: You make me sad. :(
18:30  tlonim: why Africa for birth ? Also can't birth of human civilizations have take place simultaneously at many places ?
18:30  John-Galt: That place because it's where the adaptation of early homonins chanced to occur.
18:32  John-Galt: Incidentally, the Wth was directed at CIA-9...
18:32  tlonim: John-Galt: ok..don't know much anthropology, but I meant for primates in general (not just Homo sapiens)..
18:32  thesnowdog: tlonim: Refusing to believe something is not a good start. ;-)
18:32  tlonim: thesnowdog: hmm.. I believe 
18:33  tlonim: just curious
18:33 * stepnem considers refusing to believe anything to be an excellent start
18:33  John-Galt: tlonim: Because the adaptation of any species has to happen somewhere. Speciation tends to result from eddies in the gene pool. It can't take place over large distances.
18:34  tlonim: i see..
18:34  John-Galt: Although early human and pre-human species did migrate and later inter-breed.
18:35  tlonim: maybe I should read "origin of species" first.. anyone read that ?
18:35  John-Galt: Heh. Not necessarilly the best start. Good read, but a bit dated.
18:36  thesnowdog: stepnem: Refuse sounds like a rather final position to me but perhaps I should check a dictionary definition.
18:36  tlonim: it is interesting too see some works from former theologists/theological backgrounds -- Darwin, Nietzsche 
18:37  tlonim: so I think making kids over religious is a good start :>
18:37  John-Galt: Eh, Darwin didn't have much of a theological background. He was for a while doomed to go into the church, but he was saved before it was too late.
18:38  stepnem: thesnowdog: Well, sure. You either know something or you don't. I don't see the point of believing (although it might occasionally be useful if you really need to make decisions based on something you don't know).
18:38  tlonim: John-Galt: it seems he didnt publish his work/findings for 20 years or so for same reason
18:38  Chousuke: Religion, huh. To me it has never been much more than school trips to the church :P
18:38  John-Galt: Weird to know that he didn't even have an especially religious family, but preaching was considered a respectable profession for people who were otherwise useless back them.
18:38  John-Galt: Or even for people who weren't otherwise useless... How times change.
18:39  John-Galt: Chousuke: Hmm... School trips to the church over here would cause public outrage...
18:39  John-Galt: Among religious people because it was the wrong church, and secularists because it was a church at all.
18:39  tlonim: John-Galt: teaching evolution in schools is still controversial over there right ?
18:40  thesnowdog: stepnem: Ah, your issue was with "belief". Mine too until I looked it up "accept to be true" etc.
18:40  Chousuke: John-Galt: It only happened once or twice a year though.
18:40  Chousuke: I don't know how things are nowadays
18:40  John-Galt: tlonim: In some places. :(
18:41  John-Galt: Not where I grew up, thank the gods.
18:41  Chousuke: But in elementary school we had morning assembly and sometimes there was prayer. In retrospect that sounds pretty bad.
18:41  tlonim: well.. i was in a jesuit school. quite a religious environ
18:41  thesnowdog: It never came up here either.  I think you'd be laughed out of class/school/town.
18:41  tlonim: lots of prayers hmm
18:41  Chousuke: But I don't think anyone took it seriously.
18:41  stepnem: School trips to the church are good. Architecture, art etc.
18:41  Chousuke: even most of the so-called religious folk don't take religion seriously here in Finland :P
18:42  tlonim: stepnem: yeah
18:42  tlonim: nice art
18:42  John-Galt: tlonim: Well, at least the Jesuits teach evolution.
18:42  Chousuke: stepnem: well, it was mostly just attending mass :P
18:42  tlonim: or seeing people do stuff there is funny
18:42  stepnem: Chousuke: :-P
18:42  tlonim: John-Galt: yeah..that part is nice
18:42  John-Galt: stepnem: Blech, most churches have horrible architecture and art.
18:42 * thesnowdog had a fit when informed that god put a paper bag full of money under the minister's friends door when he was in desperate need and was banished to the library...forever.
18:42  tlonim: John-Galt: they keep it separate
18:42  John-Galt: Although we've visited a few for their historical value, I'll admit.
18:42  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, not in Europe. ;-)
18:43  John-Galt: Even in Europe.
18:43  thesnowdog: stepnem: Oooh, snap.
18:43  stepnem: I beg to differ.
18:43  tlonim: I have been to a church where they have kept 
18:43 * thesnowdog too
18:43  tlonim: St Xavier's body in open
18:43  tlonim: casket
18:43  tlonim: for people to see
18:44  tlonim: apparently when it fully shirnks or something world will end.. :)
18:44  Chousuke: :P
18:44  Chousuke: Humans are weird
18:44  John-Galt: Heh
18:45  Chousuke: believing things like that with such gusto
18:45  tlonim: many people want world to end.. what to do :P
18:45  tlonim: some actively try to ensure that and others are passive aboout it 
18:46  John-Galt: Some of those people have access to nuclear weapons... or are working on it.
18:46 * thesnowdog is looking forward to being the lone survivor of the apocalypse
18:46  Chousuke: They could just kill themselves though. From their POV that would be equivalent to the world ending 
18:46  Chousuke: The problem is that they want the world to end, but not themselves ;(
18:46  John-Galt: Apparently for some of them...
18:58  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You had to make me read that blog didn't you?
18:58  thesnowdog: Though a school mate of mine is probably making the same claim in the local rag this week I expect...
19:00  thesnowdog: "don't ask, don't tell" kills birds. I knew it.
19:01  tlonim: thesnowdog: lol.. link ?
19:02  tlonim: I read these bird deaths are common just that these are highlighted nowadays.
19:04  thesnowdog: tlonim: http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/is_god_blind_or_something.php
19:04  tlonim: oh.. scienceblogs .. nice 
19:04  tlonim: thesnowdog: part about queensland is also lol
19:05  thesnowdog: Yeah, I knew Ruddy was to blame.  I guess god likes China after all.
19:06  thesnowdog: I don't buy the Israel explanation.
19:18  John-Galt: thesnowdog: blog?
19:18  John-Galt: Ah, you found the quote, then. :)
19:35  stepnem: Shouldn't we have a function that just returns the current selection, instead of creating one out of thin air like buffer.getCurrentWord() does? Or perhaps gCW() should accept an argument to only return a selection if there is one?
19:36  thesnowdog: gCW is dodgy
19:36  John-Galt: Possibly. Although it's easy enough to get the current selection.
19:36  stepnem: thesnowdog: That's the word. ;-)
19:37  John-Galt: I agree that gCW is dodgy, though. I've never liked it...
19:38  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Do you lot _really_ want to execute Assange?
19:39  stepnem: So, that was it on topic for today... :-P
19:40  thesnowdog: stepnem: It was a valiant effort.
19:40  John-Galt: thesnowdog: "us lot" *really* want to execute just about everyone. :(
19:40  thesnowdog: ...poor Mrs Assange.
19:40  tlonim: assange is the new osama laden 
19:40  tlonim: they need some enemy for their war efforts
19:41 * John-Galt is somewhat more concerned with Manning, to be honest...
19:41  thesnowdog: But he has celebrity friends. Perhaps after Clooney has finished creating his new country he can save them both.
19:41  John-Galt: There's no case against Assange, as I understand it.
19:41  John-Galt: Heh. Clooney's alright.
19:41  tlonim: yeah..manning will get tortured
19:42  John-Galt: Shit actor, but an alright guy.
19:42  John-Galt: tlonim: Manning's already being tortured.
19:42  thesnowdog: Clooney is worse than Bono.
19:42  tlonim: yeah
19:42  tlonim: that too
19:42  tlonim: Bono lol 
19:42  tlonim: humanitarian celeb 
19:43  John-Galt: thesnowdog: *No-one* is worse than Bono. At least Clooney has some sense. And doesn't have all kinds of nebulous spiritual leanings.
19:43  John-Galt: That was probably a really bad mixed metaphor...
19:43  stepnem: http://www.cracked.com/article_17239_if-bono-was-superhero.html
19:43  John-Galt: Could do with some sleep.
19:43  tlonim: John-Galt: you are into power-sleep thing ?
19:44  thesnowdog: Well I'd certainly prefer to see Clooney's latest movie than listen to Bono's latest song.
19:44  John-Galt: Heh. Bonoman.
19:44  John-Galt: tlonim: power-dleep?
19:44  John-Galt: *sleep
19:44  John-Galt: thesnowdog: True, but that's not saying much.
19:44  thesnowdog: Short naps
19:44  John-Galt: No. I can't do naps. Like, at all.
19:45  tlonim: there is one more thing ..forgot the name
19:45  John-Galt: Even if I managed to fall asleep within an hour or two, I'd be groggy the rest of the day.
19:45  tlonim: where people sleep 1 hr every 4 hrs or so
19:45  tlonim: and thats it
19:45  John-Galt: Polyphasic
19:45  tlonim: aha
19:45  tlonim: yes
19:45  tlonim: John-Galt: you do that ?
19:45  John-Galt: Bucky Fuller had his own word for it...
19:45  John-Galt: tlonim: No. I can't do naps.
19:46  John-Galt: Dymaxion sleep? Something like that...
19:46 * John-Galt wikipedias it...
19:46  John-Galt: Ah, w00t, Dymaxion it was.
19:48  thesnowdog: Hmmm, no pets allowed at the Queensland evacuation centres. Ya right...
19:49  John-Galt: Don't you hate that? As if losing your home and belongings isn't bad enough, you have to leave your pets behind to probably starve and drown.
19:50  tlonim: so it is becoming like Katrina there ?
19:50  tlonim: a big domed hall for all people ..
19:50  Chousuke: I'm happy to live in Finland :P The worst we get here is frozen sidewalks
19:51  Chousuke: I wonder if it's even possible to have an earthquake in Finland that you can actually feel /:
19:51  John-Galt: Yeah, well, you're just below the arctic circle. Just wait until global warming catches up with you.
19:53  tlonim: Chousuke: polar bears invasion ? Russians ? Tsar Bomba II ? Angry Santa Claus (isn't SC supposed to be from Finland ?) Magnetic disturbances ?
19:53  stepnem: Oh, those Russians.
19:55  thesnowdog: tlonim: Not quite.  I don't like the chances of them telling a big burley Queenslander that he can't bring his cattle dog with him.  Anyway, they've been evacuating people with their dogs and cats via helicopter anyway.
19:55  John-Galt: I'm pretty sure that a large part of the legend is Norse rather than Finish...
19:57  tlonim: you mean Thor, Odin and all ?
19:58  thesnowdog: WTH is a Tsar Bomba II? 
19:58  thesnowdog: Oooh, boom!
19:59  Chousuke: tlonim: I don't think we have anything the russians want anymore, and polar bears fortunately live further north :P
19:59  thesnowdog: ...seems like a waste to drop one on Finland really.
20:00  tlonim: Chousuke: what about death metal invasion :>
20:01  Chousuke: What effect would that have? :P
20:01  John-Galt: Well, the legend is apparently derived in part from Thor's annual visit during the winter months.
20:01  John-Galt: At least, the names Donder und Blitzen from the poem are derived from the names of his chariot horses.
20:01  tlonim: Chousuke: head-banging Fins :P
20:02  tlonim: Finns*
20:03  Chousuke: an invasion by Iku-Turso would be the most awesome
20:03  stepnem: eris_prime: Why so silent all the time? It's really hard to believe you have nothing to contribute to such discussions.
20:04 * John-Galt likes his bots on the surly side.
20:15  tlonim: any anarchists here ? :P
20:16  John-Galt: Not likely.
20:17  tlonim: today I was reading a question whether true anarchy is an utopia 
20:18  John-Galt: You mean "a Utopia"?
20:19  tlonim: yeah..a utopia
20:19  tlonim: thought of correcting it earlier :)
20:20  John-Galt: It may be a necessary condition, but certainly not a sufficient one. Humans don't deal well with anarchy.
20:21  John-Galt: Nor Utopias...
20:22  tlonim: well.. one suggested that everyone in the society must be educated enough to comprehend it fully
20:23  John-Galt: Yeah, education isn't enough.
20:48  John-Galt: stepnem: chrome://dactyl/content/marks.js: 132: TypeError: slice is undefined
20:50  stepnem: Hm. That's inside that FIXME. I should have tested if slice is null I guess.
20:50  John-Galt: Oh, and now: Processing load event: TypeError: mark is undefined
20:50  remi: is anyone using the latest Pentadactyl builds with Firefox 4.0b8?
20:51  John-Galt: http://pastebin.com/LqYyFCqB
20:51  John-Galt: remi: Of course.
20:52  remi: nothing works for me with 4.0b8, I had to revert to an old build I had. It's like as if the addon is not installed.
20:52  remi: but it is :)
20:52  stepnem: John-Galt: That's hopefully just the consequence of the same error.
20:53  John-Galt: Probably.
20:54  stepnem: John-Galt: Are going to look at it now, or should I just fix it up for the time being?
20:55  stepnem: (It's the stupid part you said you were going to look into.)
20:57  John-Galt: Well, since I have to look over it anyway, I might as well just fix it.
21:01  thesnowdog: remi: Yes, lots of people.
21:07  John-Galt: remi: :version ?
21:08 * John-Galt tries the last nightly on b8 and it works fine...
21:08  stepnem: Um, now I look at it, what I've written is even more stupid than I thought. The `else' on l. 130 doesn't make any sense at all... Other than as a "visual indicator" :-/
21:09  John-Galt: Heh
21:10  stepnem: (But the only real point where it fails to do what I intended is still probably the missing test for slice being null.)
21:11  John-Galt: Oh, crap. I can't run from the repo anymore...

21:27  John-Galt: Like, I donno, maybe it's just me, but if I found myself doing stuff like this, http://pastebin.com/dggbq623 I'd wind up stuffing the names into an array, iterating over them, and defining them as identically named properties on an object.
21:27  John-Galt: Or just defining a _() function.
21:28  John-Galt: Oh, and I'd probably use some kind of sane indentation, too...

21:38  John-Galt: It's the only way to explain some of the weird indentation I come across.
22:03 * thesnowdog has decided that "assets" is the word that will produce spontaneous vomitting this year
22:03  stepnem: Assets!
22:04  thesnowdog: Damn it!
22:04  thesnowdog: The CES are sending "air assets" to rescue some stranded flood victims
22:04 * stepnem imagines thesnowdog trying to wipe off the vomit off his keyboard
22:06  stepnem: Hm, that random message editing...
22:07  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Don't you love corporate speak?
22:08  John-Galt: People are actually complaining about this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622321
22:09  John-Galt: Silly, really. :(
22:09  stepnem: You just have to appropriately leverage the assets.
22:09  John-Galt: Or, :)
22:10  John-Galt: Hm. My mother sent me one of these: http://skepticbros.com/placebo-bands/ Only it doesn't say placebo... and it links to a web site with those very demonstrations... only it apparently plays them straight.
22:11 * John-Galt wonders whether to send her the link back...
22:11 * John-Galt wonders whether she'd get the irony of the sales page...
22:13  peth: perfect opportunity for a life lesson if she's the person who can take it, i'd say
22:15  peth: amazingly, i know more than a handful of people i'm pretty sure would get angry at *me* for showing them
22:15  John-Galt: Ugh. She'll never learn. She seems to buy a new exercise machine every 8 months or so, none of which she's ever used. She even bought a book off of Kevin Tru... however it's spelled.
22:15  John-Galt: I told her he's banned from selling things on TV now and her eyes kind of glazed over.
22:15  peth: i've seen the glazing over. it frightens me. :/
22:16  John-Galt: Yep.
22:16  John-Galt: She's nothing to my father though... He thinks the world's going to end in 2012, among (many) other things...
22:17  John-Galt: He thought it was going to end in '02 or somewhere thereabouts, too... when that didn't happen he blamed government misinformation and revised his date.
22:17  stepnem: LOL
22:17  peth: religious or individual nuttiness?
22:18  John-Galt: Depends on how you define religious. He'd swear he's not religious. But he appals to the Universe and spends more hours with his Tarot cards than can be good for anyone.
22:19  peth: ok, i'd lump that in. spiritual then.
22:19  peth: sorry to hear anyways
22:20  peth: my mother is on the simple side too, i know how that can feel.
22:20  John-Galt: Eh, such is life. The man has a hell of an IQ on him, too -- or had. Shame, really.
22:41  ber_t: Hi
22:41  ber_t: is anyone else experiencing some "ReferenceError: JSMLoader is not defined" trouble
22:42  ber_t: I got it since revision 5261
22:43  John-Galt: On 3.x, yeah.
22:44  ber_t: Is there anything I can do to fix it?
22:44  John-Galt: Wait? Or upgrade to 4.x
22:44  John-Galt: Or downgrade Pentadactyl.
22:45  ber_t: But you're aware of it, so you gonna fix this, or should I file a bug report?
22:45  John-Galt: Yes, I'm going to fix it.
22:46  ber_t: Okay, thanks
