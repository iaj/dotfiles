15:29  tlonim: i am using source-css method for applying css to pages, what is the behavior defined when there are multiple moz-document sections in a file ?
15:29  tlonim: i mean from generic ones to most specific ones

16:16  Chousuke: Hmm, it seems the Firefox 32-bit slowness problem I was experiencing is pretty much solved.
16:16  Chousuke: turns out Firefox was trying to use opengl for hardware acceleration even though my graphics chip doesn't support it.
16:17  Chousuke: and so it was using the software renderer. Which apparently is fast enough in 64-bit mode but not in 32-bit mode.
16:19  Chousuke: Curiously, it seems that 64-bit firefox is somewhat faster when "accelerated" with OS X's  software OpenGL renderer than it is with its own software rendering code. :P
17:11  John-Galt: Not surprising, really.
17:12  John-Galt: tlonim: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/@-moz-document
17:26  tlonim: John-Galt: yeah. checked that...thing is i have one moz-document -- generic one and one only for one site(which should not have generic one).. ..thing is i cannot negate in the first one too
17:27  tlonim: so my question does the order in which different moz-documents are specified in the file make difference ?
17:28  John-Galt: The order matters, but not much. The ordinary rules for CSS precedence apply. http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html
17:29  tlonim: the generic one in my case is dark background one and the specific one is only for one site(for which dark one doesn't look good) ... 
17:29  tlonim: John-Galt: ok..
17:31  tlonim: i could use Stylish but i didnt want another addon just for this 
17:31  tlonim: also stylish stores all css in a database, i cant edit with vim etc.. and builtin editor sucks 
17:33  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, i am seeing a strange issue of not being able to use keybindings when a page is in initially stage of getting loaded
17:33  tlonim: to reproduce: new tab, load a page which can take sometime to load, during the white  loading background i cant use keys to change tab
17:34  stepnem: tlonim: there is a bug report for that
17:34  tlonim: but after page is partially rendered or so, i can use... not before that
17:34  tlonim: stepnem: oh.. is it ? 
17:34  tlonim: didnt know that
17:34  tlonim: let me check
17:35  tlonim: https://groups.google.com/group/dactyl-bugs/browse_thread/thread/8eb62e3eea2c1ee6 ok ..
17:37  tlonim: stepnem: thanks.. it is exactly the same issue 
17:37  tlonim: it gets quite irritating when the loading blocks keybindings :)
17:41  John-Galt: Stylish works exactly the same way as :source *.css and :style
17:42  tlonim: John-Galt: yeah..but my only issue with that was editing files.. it stores them in a sqlite database .. 
17:42  John-Galt: Really? It used to use RDF.
17:43  tlonim: oh..is it ? i checked profile folder 
17:43  tlonim: hmmm.. 
17:43  tlonim: may be i missed then
17:43  tlonim: John-Galt: you use Stylish ?
17:43  John-Galt: Not in ages, no. That's why I wrote the :style interface.
17:44  tlonim: ok
17:44  stepnem: I see both stylish.rdf and stylish.sqlite here, never checked the contents of the latter.
17:45  tlonim: i thought all go into the sqlite one
17:45  tlonim: but it would have been better if the styles were kept in a separate files
17:47  John-Galt: They might have switched to sqlite recently. RDF is monstrous.
17:48  tlonim: yeah.. i have seen firefox being one of the projects being a heavy user of RDG
17:48  tlonim: RDF*
17:48  tlonim: they use RDF even for simple ones 
17:56  tlonim: btw, is there a way ot introduce context when jumping to search results like in vim ?
17:56  tlonim: context of +- 5 lines for instance
17:57  tlonim: like scrolloff in vim
17:59  John-Galt: Nope. Not at the moment, anyway.
19:15  rogutes: Isn't it strange that ':map <Right> gt' doesn't work when a tab is almost loaded (even though gt by itself works)?
19:25  tlonim: rogutes: yeah..it is a bug it seems
19:25  tlonim: check the bug tracker
