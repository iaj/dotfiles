01:22  John-Galt: Oh, bugger, now I've got ‘Jolene’ stuck in my head.
01:23 * Monkey likes Jolene
01:23  Monkey: ...then again me is watching Stevie Nicks at Red Rocks
01:23  John-Galt: So do I, I have to admit, but I hate Dollie with a passion.
01:24 * Monkey is amused by his use of "me"
01:24  Monkey: ...small minds are easily amused so they say
01:24  John-Galt: Yeah, gave me pause, too.
01:31 * Monkey now has Edge of Seventeen stuck in his head for the day
01:34 * Monkey would like to eat that dove
01:36 * John-Galt generally recommends against the eating of doves.
01:36  John-Galt: You never know what kind of Holy Spirit you might catch.
01:38  John-Galt: Damn it. Now *I* have Edge of Seventeen stuck in my head.
01:43 * Monkey is black and therefore evil enough to resist the advances of any holy spirits
02:40 * John-Galt thinks that libgpod/gtkpod are pretty terrible and isn't sure why he wrote so much code to get them working with his iPod...
02:40  John-Galt: Except perhaps that there's nothing better that's immediately available...

03:05  John-Galt: Cephalopods are so awesome. I don't even understand the point of generas that don't even have chromatophores.
03:06  John-Galt: Er, genera. /me slinks away in shame.

03:12  graffatcolmingov: wrong channel
03:12  graffatcolmingov: heh
03:12  John-Galt: It would irritate him even more than the Barack Obama sign that I asked the proselytes to put on our lawn when I was living with him...
03:12  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: O.o

17:36  zeltak: yay...bookmark toolbar finally appears in ff4beta10/latst penta
17:37 * zeltak wonders if today is FINALLY the day he creates some kind of backup system thats sooooo long overdue
17:43 * John-Galt has been awake for over an hour and isn't remotely happy about it.
17:43  John-Galt: zeltak: It's always worked so long as it was enabled from the View menu.
17:44  John-Galt: Although I really can't see why anyone would possibly want to use it.
17:46  zeltak: what do you mean? it was coming up black before and i use it to open bookamrks and groups of bookmarks, also to bookmark to a specific folder
17:46  zeltak: *black not black
17:46  John-Galt: Yeah, but you never opened it from the View menu, apparently.
17:47  zeltak: i assigned a hotkey for :toolbartoggle Bookmarks Toolbar
17:47  zeltak: well at least it works now :) what i really lack in penta is the abiltiy to save a bookmark to a specific folder/subfolder
17:47  zeltak: still need the gui for that
17:49  John-Galt: So why on earth would you use the bookmarks toolbar? Just use the sidebar.
17:49  John-Galt: Or don't use folders.
17:50  zeltak: well i guess its old habits..really like that it sticks on top :)
17:50  John-Galt: Ugh. Useless waste of space.
17:50  zeltak: and i really need folders..i have hundreds of bookmarks which are devided into subjects..how on earth would you find them easly if there are all in one spcace
17:50  John-Galt: tags
17:51  zeltak: well i just bring it up (the toolbar) with F9 when i need it, doesnt waste any space
17:51  zeltak: mmmm but that means i have to tah like 1000 bookmarks now..lol..rather spend my valuable time reading the penta manuall ;-)
17:52  John-Galt: Huh?
17:52  zeltak: tags dont automagiccly appeaer right :)? if i wanna use tags and chuck everything in one folder ill need to tag my already existing bookmarks?
17:54  John-Galt: Yeah, that's easily done.
17:54  zeltak: really? do tell :)
17:54  John-Galt: Well, I'd script it. But you can use :em Bookmarks.Show All Bookmarks
17:54  John-Galt: It lets you tag whole groups of bookmarks at once.
17:55  zeltak: hmmm ok, ill look into it :)
17:55  zeltak: the other second major issue is as i said downloads..i really hate using the gui for that :)
17:56  John-Galt: Damn it. My command-line history is getting wiped on :rehash now. :(
17:57  John-Galt: zeltak: Well, the download manager interface is horribly designed. I have to write bloody SQL to deal with the same data as the current UI.
17:57  zeltak: yeah i can imagine its lots of boring work :)
17:58  zeltak: i tried installing donwloadthemall and flashgot to see if they have any kind of keyboard scheme but nada
17:58  John-Galt: What do either of those have to do with the download manager?
17:58  zeltak: well download them all is kinda a download manager?isnt it?
17:59  zeltak: it replaces the built in one as far as ai can tell
17:59  John-Galt: Not to my knowledge.
18:00  zeltak: mmm it calles itself a donwload manager but maybe its just a wrapper..dunno really
18:01  zeltak: just trying to find a solution to do F (open hints)-hint #-'a" (saves automaticlly to /home/user/a/)
18:16 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * f450c037e7e514b7068f3e30be4606ce6fd13b0d / (10 files in 3 dirs) Make buffer.URL a string again. Use buffer.uri and buffer.documentURI internally. Fix loading Object stores.
18:19  John-Galt: Well, that should fix people losing their quickmarks...
18:40  Chousuke: I wonder what happened in beta9 to make hint rendering behave like it does now :/ it's weird.
18:40  John-Galt: Works for me.
18:40  Chousuke: For me all hinted elements disappear for a quarter second or so before the hints are rendered.
18:40  Chousuke: and sometimes the title bar style goes crazy
18:41  Chousuke: flickering from unified gradient to non-unified
18:41  John-Galt: Weird. Try turning off their opacity.
18:41  Chousuke: hint opacity you mean?
18:41  John-Galt: Yeah.
18:42  Chousuke: hmm yeah I turned off the opacity and now it's fine.
18:43  Chousuke: too bad, I like the hint colours to be a bit transparent. Helps with images.
18:43  John-Galt: Shame.
18:44  Chousuke: I suppose I could file a bug report to mozilla but I'm not sure what the actual problem is :P
18:45  John-Galt: Yeah... might be worth a try anyway, though.
18:46  tlonim: John-Galt: for some reason undo is broken for me.. 4b10pre
18:46  John-Galt: Not for me.
18:46  tlonim: is the undo stack maintained by firefox or dactyl ?
18:46  tlonim: so i can do :js something to query it
18:46  tlonim: and see 
18:46  John-Galt: Firefox.
18:46  tlonim: you know how to query it ?
18:47  tlonim: i am seeing a undoCloseTab now
18:48  John-Galt: window.undoCloseTab
18:49  tlonim: did.. :js window.undoCloseTab() ..nothing happens.
18:49  tlonim: let me check console
18:49 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * d8d492ef31d771bcd65f0f89e9930520196e86ba /common/content/dactyl.js Don't use a sandbox for the command-line. I'm tired of "can't wrap XML objects" and random untoward crashes.
18:50  John-Galt: Well, then, you probably have one of those godawful tab extensions installed.
18:50  tlonim: oosp.. it requires index
18:50  tlonim: what index is that ? number of closed tabs to retrieve
18:51  John-Galt: No. The index into the list of recently closed tabs.
18:51  tlonim: yeah,, so index 0(or -1) is like the last tab closed ?
18:52  John-Galt: 0
18:52  Chousuke: Hmm, I suppose I should test with minefield first
18:52  John-Galt: Although leaving the index out should be fine.
18:52  John-Galt: Chousuke: That would be sensible...
18:53  tlonim: John-Galt: are you using latest nightly ? 
18:53  Chousuke: something to replicate this problem without pentadactyl would probably help too :P
18:53  tlonim: damn..something seems to be broken
18:53  John-Galt: Yesterday's nightly.
18:53  John-Galt: Chousuke: Yeah, they tend to require that...
18:54  Chousuke: probably something that just creates an opaque element over an existing one with javascrip would work
18:54  Chousuke: javascript*
18:54  John-Galt: You could just make a test case that injects a bunch of nodes with the same styling as hints into a document after a delay.
18:55 * John-Galt notes that hints are injected with display:none and then made visible later.
18:55  Chousuke: hmm.
18:56  tlonim: John-Galt: i did disable all addons except dactyl to no avail
18:57 * John-Galt wonders why people bitch about GM not being compatible with FF4 rather than just using Scriptish.
18:57  John-Galt: tlonim: Does undo from the tab context menu work?
18:57  Chousuke: oh good news. the problem goes away on minefield
18:57  tlonim: let me see that
18:57  Chousuke: for once it's this way around
18:58 * Chousuke wonders what broke now instead.
18:59  Chousuke: at least tab undoing works
18:59  tlonim: John-Galt: my tab bar context menu doesnt have that option
18:59  tlonim: you meant tab bar context menu right ?
18:59  Chousuke: right-click on a tab
19:00  tlonim: brb
19:01  tlonim: for me it is there
19:01  tlonim: but blurred out aka not possible to use
19:01  John-Galt: Well, there you go. Nothing in the undo history.
19:02  John-Galt: Incidentally, the ↓ to the right hand side of the tab bar is the undo menu.
19:04  tlonim: but i closed a few tabs ..so history should be there
19:04  John-Galt: Apparently not.
19:04  tlonim: hmm.. does history depend on something like orbit/dbus/fancy.. it was giving me some orbit error yesterday
19:05  John-Galt: Nope.
19:05  John-Galt: You could try #firefox, I suppose.
19:06  tlonim: ok
19:06  tlonim: let me try with new profile and see
19:07  John-Galt: That would make more sense. #firefox is completely useless.
19:07  tlonim: that channel is very idle
19:07  tlonim: like dead
19:07  tlonim: John-Galt: i  guess developers use a separate channel ?
19:07  tlonim: firefox dev i mean
19:07  John-Galt: Well, it's on irc.mozilla.org, obviously.
19:08  John-Galt: And there's probably an active one on Freenode, because it's Freenode...
19:08  tlonim: http://sprunge.us/EgHb 
19:08  tlonim: this is weird
19:08  tlonim: is libxul.so dlopened ?
19:09  John-Galt: Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
19:09  tlonim: nah..just asking
19:09  tlonim: since it says "not found?"
19:09  tlonim: i thought may be i broke something
19:10  John-Galt: It's dlopened by the rtld. It's not found because the run_mozilla script sets up your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it can be found.
19:10  tlonim: gotcha
19:10  tlonim: since there is libdl.so in ldd output that was a hint as well
19:11  John-Galt: Ugh. libdl. Linux. :(
19:11  John-Galt: tlonim: Yes, it dynamically loads quite a lot of other libraries. Even tries for some Gnome libs.
19:12  tlonim: in other nixes it is not so ? like BSD dont use libdl or similar ?
19:13  John-Galt: BSDs tend to have the functionality of libdl in libc.
19:16  tlonim: ok
19:19  tlonim: speaking of libcs, have you tried dietlibc ?
19:19  tlonim: i have heard some nice stuff about it
19:19  John-Galt: It's crap.
19:19  tlonim: oh
19:20  John-Galt: On the one hand, it's small. On the other hand, the code is horrible and it's only a partial implementation of most interfaces.
19:20  tlonim: but glibc can be intimdiating for many people because of its code size and legacy stuff in it
19:20  John-Galt: uClibc might be somewhat better, though I don't recall. If I were going for a small libc, though, I'd choose Plan 9's in a second.
19:21  John-Galt: glibc is horrendous. That's not even in question.
19:21  tlonim: oh.. plan9 also has one ? let me check
19:21  tlonim: still people do plan9 system development like core libraries ? 
19:22  John-Galt: Yes.
19:45 * John-Galt needs coffee.
19:55  Monkey: John-Galt: util.dump("what the fuck?"); intentional?
19:58  John-Galt: Oops?
19:59  Monkey: Grandma said it was rude.
19:59  John-Galt: Heh
20:00 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 5f2e7790aa8577402600b6ee742641883d70e5c5 /common/content/dactyl.js Remove unnecessarily gratuitous dump statement.
20:02 * John-Galt goes to make that coffee...
20:19  iaj: are there any plans on having a jumplist so you can use `` to jump back where you've been before
20:36  John-Galt: iaj: You already can, only it's spelled ''
20:36  iaj: John-Galt: omg :) thanks!

21:17  John-Galt: Does it? I got rid of mine ages ago.
21:49  iaj: do you guys even use the mouse when browsing?
21:50  John-Galt: Of course.
21:50  iaj: hm, what for?  :-)  i wonder if theres some hint opening firebug?
21:50  John-Galt: Because it's useful.
21:50  iaj: some possible for getting up the inspect thingie from firebug with hint
21:52  John-Galt: That can be done, yes.
21:55  iaj: Can you tell me how - or do you mean generally achieved?
21:57  John-Galt: With hints.addMode it can be done. Some method of window.Firebug (check what the "Inspect this" command on the context menu does) should do the work.
21:57  John-Galt: Finding a useful xpath would I expect be tricky.
21:57  John-Galt: In fact, you'd probably want a plugin which adds a new key binding and a whole set of hint modes of its own.
21:58  iaj: hmm ok... thanks for the information
22:00  John-Galt: Do I even need to comment on this? http://pastebin.com/7KaH7d66

22:15 * John-Galt wonders what code in io.js is based on Venkman, and why anyone would want to base any code on Venkman to begin with...
22:30  Monkey: John-Galt: The first version of that was generally a straight rip from Venkman. I doubt there's anything left.
22:32  John-Galt: Interesting...
22:39 * John-Galt thinks perhaps he shouldn't be so thoroughly disinclined to use XBL...
