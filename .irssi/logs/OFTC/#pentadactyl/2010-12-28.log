15:26  stepnem: Must be because of :dia addons etc.
16:04  John-Galt: Hmm... "In the 1970s, paedophilia was theorised as something fully in conformity with man and even with children," the Pope said.
16:04  John-Galt: I'm glad I wasn't around for the '70s...
16:04  stepnem: WHAT?
16:04  stepnem: Benedict strikes again?
16:10  John-Galt: Donno. I can kind of see his reasoning. If all those priests were doing it, it must have been right.
