00:30  iaj: Hmm, is the Textarea thingie working?
00:31  John-Galt: If you mean Text Edit mode, then yes.
00:35  iaj: Ahhh, nevermind yeah.. it is.. even tho dw isn't working for me
00:36 * John-Galt decides that there are no high rises or decent bridges in central Florida.
02:52 * John-Galt has beer. All is right with the world.

03:09 --- peth_ is now known as peth
03:57 * Monkey is reassured that 16 Australians are more significant than 500+ Brazilians
03:57  John-Galt: Huh?
04:46  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: btw, that email about 3.6 provides the same messages I received with go+=n/N in 3.6
05:08 * John-Galt has the unshakeable desire to implode.

12:06  tlonim: are the zoom percentages displayed in status correct ?
12:06  tlonim: sometimes i see some wildly high values
12:06  tlonim: like 900%
12:31  sp3ctum: http://www.norfolkwinters.com/vim-creep?c=1
13:46  zeltak: morning all :) 
13:47  zeltak: just thouth about something..would be cool to have a keybind to auto select the first google search result instead of F>number
14:08  Monkey: zeltek: I'm Feeling Lucky?
14:14  Monkey: sp3ctum: Ah, ViEmu. Those were the days...
15:59  tlonim: :run is failiing because of some strict mode restrictions
16:02  tlonim: io.jsm:420
16:15  graffatcolmingov: So I'm going to guess 4b8 will no longer be supported :P
16:17  tlonim: graffatcolmingov: why ?
16:18  tlonim: graffatcolmingov: is something like :run <external command> failing for you ?
16:19  tlonim: for default shell, it is failing because it is trying to 'cd' and failing

22:43 --- Channel #pentadactyl was synced in 3 seconds
22:43  Monkey: ...this channel is special
22:44  John-Galt: Yes.
22:51  John-Galt: Yay. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591425 is now critical. And probably won't be fixed.
22:52  Monkey: Yeah, thought the same.
22:55 * John-Galt thinks we should include an opt-in for one of those wonderful features of replacing random words on every page with links that try to sell you things.
22:56  stepnem: Hm, is that another of recent Firefox improvements?
22:57  John-Galt: Nope, but loads of add-ons include such wondrous features now. They just have to get you to opt in first.
23:01  John-Galt: Heh. It's not critical anymore. :)
23:02  Monkey: ffs
23:10  durka42: okay, so I installed firefox 4 beta, and the latest pentadactyl nightly, and even disabled extensions.checkCompatibility.4.0b, and I have no pentadactyl :(
23:11  John-Galt: Did you have a beta installed beforehand?
23:12  durka42: no, I had 3.6
23:13  John-Galt: I mean a Pentadactyl beta.
23:13  John-Galt: eris_prime: xpi hg5303
23:13  eris_prime: John-Galt :extadd http://dactyl.googlecode.com/files/pentadactyl-hg5303.xpi
23:13  John-Galt: Try that.
23:14  durka42: John-Galt: I can't :)
23:14  durka42: i can click the link though
23:15  John-Galt: You can certainly install the XPI...
23:19  John-Galt: Hm. Why does Mibbit say "Fixing bugs" ... "Applying a pinch of salt" at startup?
23:21  stepnem: daemon: Are you a good daemon, or a bad one?
23:21  daemon: Apparently one with someone else's handle...
23:23  daemon: Hmm... at least there's a pastebin button. Not all is wrong with the world I guess. Why is the input box proportionally spaced while the output is monospaced?
23:23  daemon: Oh, that's proportional too. Just a different font.
23:24  John-Galt: 16:32 < tlonim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZLQW2qr5Hs one of the best clips
23:24  daemon: Oh.
23:24  durka42: ok, chrome now so I stop signing off
23:24  durka42: I still can't get firefox 4.0b to activate pentadactyl
23:24  durka42: I started a new session
23:25  stepnem: durka42: Try the magic -purgecaches option.
23:28  stepnem: What's horrible are the spaces irssi puts inside the < nick> thing. I seem to recall there was an option to fix that, though.
23:29  John-Galt: I like them.
23:29  John-Galt: Anyway, yeah, there's a format string.
23:29  stepnem: Yeah, I've always thought you had strange taste.
23:30  stepnem: Something must have gone wrong.
23:30  John-Galt: I just like things to be aligned.
23:31  John-Galt: I thought he was 17:24 < durka42> ok, chrome now so I stop signing off
23:39  John-Galt: Heh. Apparently application.prefs.all is not lazily instantiated. Plays merry hell with JS completion.
