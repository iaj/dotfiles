00:07  John-Ga1t: Weird.
00:07 --- John-Ga1t is now known as John-Galt
01:45  John-Galt: Oh, good. Maybe this one will work properly.
01:49  heftig: interesting new :downloads
01:49  heftig: it seems the commands are only usable by clicking with the mouse?
01:50  John-Galt: Yes.
01:50  John-Galt: Or with hints.
01:51  heftig: hints don't seme to work, only hinting the filenames and the URLs
01:51  John-Galt: You have a point.
01:53  eris_prime: Use anchor tags for Buttons in :downloads rather than spans as the former are automatically hintable.
01:54  John-Galt: Apparently CIA-6 sucks too.
02:02  heftig: it seems online installation is broken, updating the XPI disables pentadactyl until a browser restart
02:03  John-Galt: Damn it.
02:04  heftig: got something in stderr, gonna pastebin
02:04  John-Galt: Don't bother. I see it.

02:28  winn: When using a command like :emenu , is there a way to list all of the options?
02:28  stepnem: winn: Not sure I understand. How does tab completion fail to satisfy your needs?
02:29  winn: stepnem: thanks, I guess I don't know what tab completion is.
02:29  stepnem: winn: Press Tab when the command line is open.
02:30  winn: stepnem: so  :emenu  and then hit tab?
02:30  stepnem: Whatever. Tab completion works for just about everything.
02:31  winn: stepnem: OK when I do that nothing pops up.
02:31  stepnem: Interesting.
02:32  stepnem: What exactly did you do?
02:33  winn: I type:  :emenu  and then hit tab
02:33  stepnem: winn: :yank :version
02:34  John-Galt: I suspect he probably has some strange settings from yore. Although 'autocomplete' is new and enabled by default, so...
02:34  John-Galt: But a 'wildmode' without list* in it would at least kill the menu on <Tab>.
02:35  winn: stepnem: Pentadactyl 1.0b4.3 (created: 2011/01/05 17:55:12) running on:
02:35  winn: stepnem: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20101231 Firefox-4.0/4.0b8
02:35  heftig: if complete=f broken?
02:35  stepnem: winn: What does :set wildmode say?
02:36  heftig: doesn't return any results here
02:36  heftig: s/if/is/
02:36  John-Galt: heftig: No, it's not, but it only turns on when the file starts with ./, ~/, or /
02:36  John-Galt: Because it's too damned slow.
02:36  winn: stepnem: wildmode=list:full
02:36  heftig: ah, okay, thanks :(
02:36  heftig: )
02:37  heftig: John-Galt: it's slow? didn't notice that
02:37  stepnem: winn: Hm... I'm out of my wit I guess. Could you perhaps pastebin your rc file?
02:37  winn: stepnem: It's just the default, haven't changed anything.
02:38  stepnem: I see. Do you see any errors in the console or :messages or something? Everything seems to work otherwise?
02:38  John-Galt: heftig: It is compared to the other completers. It slows :open autocompletion down considerably.
02:39  heftig: I just notice that the file completer seems to return results instantly, while the location completer takes a moment most of the time
02:39  winn: stepnem: yes
02:39  stepnem: winn: E.g., you do you get autocompletion when you open the command line? Such as after pressin `o'?
02:39  winn: stepnem: I mean no errors, everything seems to work
02:40  winn: stepnem: yes I get autocompletion.
02:40  stepnem: Heh. Are you sure you don't get any completion after :emenu?
02:42  winn: stepnem: I do get autocompletion in that when I start typing  :em  the enu appears in grey, etc. What I'm looking for is a list of the menu options.
02:43  stepnem: winn: You mean the actual menu items, like Bookmark etc., right?
02:43  winn: stepnem: Right like File-Open, etc.
02:44  stepnem: Well it should work, and does for me.
02:44  heftig: winn: the menu options should appear after typing a space after :emenu
02:45  winn: heftig: Ahhh, I knew I was missing something. Thanks!
02:45  heftig: x)
02:46  stepnem: ehrm... I wonder what "I type :emenu  and then hit tab" meant then... >_> 
02:47  winn: stepnem: right I put that extra space in, sorry.
02:47  John-Galt: heftig: That's because the location completions are async.
02:47  heftig: John-Galt: oh, I see
02:47  winn: Another question:  If a site has an RSS feed is there an easy way to get to it?
02:48  stepnem: winn: :h :pageinfo
02:49  heftig: John-Galt: time remaining in :downloads seems to fluctuate wildly between individual executions of :downloads
02:49  winn: stepnem: perfect, I missed that in the docs somehow.
02:49  winn: This is a great product btw. Thanks to all contributing.
02:49  John-Galt: heftig: Example?
02:50  heftig: 27 minutes vs. 1h 37m
02:50  heftig: 27minutes is correct
02:50  heftig: sometimes, at rando, it displays over an hour
02:50  John-Galt: Well, I don't do the calculations. Does the ordinary download manager behave similarly?
02:52  heftig: it displays "Unknown time remaining" sometimes, for a second
02:53  John-Galt: Ok. I'll look into it.
02:53  heftig: thanks
02:55  heftig: ah, also, minutes:seconds is missing the leading zero for the seconds :)
02:57  John-Galt: Hm. You have a point. We unfortunately don't have printf.
03:02  heftig: there's this: http://code.google.com/p/jsxt/source/browse/trunk/js/String.js#452
03:02  heftig: or this: http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/javascript-sprintf
03:03  John-Galt: I don't use external library code.
03:04  heftig: I don't advocate importing an entire library
03:04  heftig: anyway, maybe simply prefixing a 0 if seconds < 10 is best?
03:05  John-Galt: I don't use external library code at all. Expecially if it's not MIT licensed.
03:05  John-Galt: *Especially.
03:07  heftig: you already have formatSeconds, I see
03:07  heftig: should be rather trivial?
03:07  John-Galt: Yes.
03:11  heftig: also, javascript has no divmod? kinda sucks :/
03:12  John-Galt: It's just called div in C. Anyway, it's not surprising.
03:13  stepnem: heftig: JS has no integers ;-)
03:14  John-Galt: There's that, too. Although I think that Spidermonkey might have some hybrid scheme. I don't remember.
03:15  heftig: I assume it uses integers internally as much as it can
03:17  John-Galt: Don't assume. I'm not certain. Most JS engines use doubles everywhere. The semantics have to match the semantics of using doubles everywhere, in any case.
03:18  heftig: the spec says they have to act exactly like doubles?
03:18  John-Galt: Yes.
03:20  heftig: i see
03:22 --- frakturfreak_ is now known as frakturfreak
03:23  heftig: starting a new download opens the :downloads, but the new download is missing and it's a hard to close
03:23  John-Galt: Huh?
03:24  heftig: I start a new download. that automatically displays :downloads
03:24  heftig: however, the new download is missing from the list
03:24  heftig: also, i can't close the display by esc or return
03:24  heftig: switching to another tab closes it
03:24  John-Galt: No it doesn't. That would be horrible.
03:26  heftig: running :downloads normally puts pentadactyl into output-multiline mode
03:26  heftig: that's apparently terminated when i switch to another tab
03:27  heftig: the :downloads that is opened when starting a new download doesn't change the status bar to OUTPUT-MULTILINE
03:27  John-Galt: I don't know what you could possibly be doing that starting a new download runs :downloads, but it's most certainly *not* supposed to happen.
03:28  heftig: i follow a link that causes the download dialog to display
03:28  John-Galt: Although... come to think of it, if the observer for some reason wasn't cleaned up properly and you had some absurd setting like browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting=true, then the MOW might get opened when a new download starts.
03:28  heftig: i hit enter, it shows the output
03:29  stepnem: John-Galt: If I'm not mistaken, that "absurd setting" is the default.
03:30  heftig: John-Galt: it's false
03:30  heftig: stepnem: it is.
03:30  heftig: John-Galt: you're probably right. running :version, it now displays the version
03:31  stepnem: And I certainly expect the standard download window to pop up when I start a download, so I hope you didn't really broke it...
03:31  stepnem: break*
03:32  John-Galt: stepnem: It may be the default, but it's still absurd.
03:32  stepnem: Absurdity is subjective, as everything. I like it.
03:32  heftig: John-Galt: I believe users expect a display of download progress
03:33  John-Galt: In which case they can open the download manager when they're ready for it.
03:33  stepnem: Yeah, unless they want to do that always, and that's why the pref is there.
03:36  stepnem: I always only use a single fullscreen FF window, so having the dl manager open in another window and switching to it with a single WM shortcut is much more convenient than opening it manually, let alone using the new :downloads.
03:37  John-Galt: Well, no-one's stopping you from using it, I'm just saying you're an idiot is all.
03:38  stepnem: Thank you very much. Jesus loves you.
03:39  John-Galt: Jesus loves us all.

06:38  thesnowdog: Maintaining backward compatibility with alpha changes is nuts.
06:48  John-Galt: I think 'c' is a good choice for its current purpose. I don't think it's an especially good one for the one in question.
06:52  thesnowdog: Well I'd never even heard of 'c' I assumed you mentioned it since you were interested in matching Vim. 'd' is free, I think 'f' is too specific.
06:52  thesnowdog: Then again, in absolute terms these single char options are total crap anyway.
06:53  John-Galt: True. Perhaps we should just ditch them.
06:53  John-Galt: We should probably just ditch them. I can never remember what they mean.
06:55  thesnowdog: Nor can I. guioptions=b, C, r, s, c (default: bCrs) is almost meaningless to me.
06:57  thesnowdog: ...of course don't ask me to name their replacements. :)
06:57  John-Galt: Hmm... C=use a separate command-line, s=show status line, b=... no idea, r=right hand scrollbar
06:57  John-Galt: Ah, b=bottom scrollbar, then.

08:17  tlonim: they may object to that.. also Apple and Google  fight over iOs/Android will mean
08:17  tlonim: it will take sometime
08:19  tlonim: native webm support in linux is not good .. 
08:20  John-Galt: WebM has for all intents and purposes won already. Safari already has a minor market share everywhere but on the iPhone, and Google controls YouTube.
08:20  John-Galt: Supporting native YouTube video on portable devides is not exactly a trivial feature.

11:48  John-Galt: No way in hell.
11:49  tlonim: oh
11:52  stepnem: An option for the dialog vs prompt thing sounds good. As to replacing the character option values with something else, I don't think it would help with the current option system, really. The new values would either be ridiculously long or not much more telling than the characters.
11:58  stepnem: (On that note, 'fh' is still a number option.)
12:12  sp3ctum: is there a way to arrange :downloads by time instead of by file name?
12:12  sp3ctum: like how :dialog downloads does it

22:19  zeltak: kk thx :)
22:20  John-Galt: Apparently it's set -o vi in bash.
22:21  zeltak: im using zsh so ill try the above thx :)
22:48  Monkey: The whinging in #78414 is mildly amusing
22:49  John-Galt: I keep deleting the CCs on that one without reading them...
22:56  quesada: is there a setting to revert to the :open behaviour in vimperator? i.e. no tab completion, instead full first match completion, plus arrow keys
22:57  John-Galt: :set autocomplete=
22:58  quesada: hm,
22:58  quesada: but arrows do nothing then
22:59  John-Galt: What do you mean?
22:59  quesada: I hope I didn't screw up my config
22:59  quesada: I want to type : mai and get mail.google.com. then I press enter
22:59  quesada: no need for tab, nor options
23:00  quesada: or maybe it was mai<up><enter>
23:00  John-Galt: Yeah, it was probably that. Vimperator never had the former behavior.
23:01  quesada: ok, then :) how do I get that in pdactyl?
23:01  quesada: great name btw
23:01  John-Galt: It should just work.
23:02  quesada: nope, arrows do nothing
23:02 * John-Galt gets more complaints about the name than anything else...
23:02  John-Galt: quesada: :version ?
23:02  quesada: 1,0b2
23:02  John-Galt: You might have some mappings screwing with history, I suppose.
23:02  John-Galt: quesada: Oh, that's old. You need to upgrade... badly.
23:03  quesada: aha
23:03  Chousuke: John-Galt: When were you planning to release 1.0? After FF4?
23:04  John-Galt: Chousuke: That was the plan, since they keep adding bloody breaking changes to the beta line.
23:04  Chousuke: heh
23:05  John-Galt: Granted, so do I, but I don't have thousands of developers writing plugins for my code.
23:05  quesada: now I'm on 1.0b3, still arrows do nothing after set auc=
23:05  John-Galt: Actually, come to think of it, no I don't. I keep adding deprecation warnings...
23:06  John-Galt: quesada: You want 1.0b4.3. At any rate, you probably have some mapping issues.
23:07  quesada: now it works, thanks
23:08  John-Galt: What fixed it?
23:09  quesada: I guess history was reset
23:09  quesada: I typed the full url once, then pdactyl found it with the arrows the seocnd time
23:10  John-Galt: Heh. History isn't carried over from Vimperator unless you mv ~/.{vimperator,pentadactyl} if that's what you mean.
23:10  quesada: that was it
23:11  quesada: should I rename my vimperatorrc to pentadactylrc?
23:11  John-Galt: I suppose I should add that to the FAQ. I know there are a couple of migration guides on the interwebs.
23:11  John-Galt: quesada: It would probably a good start, but be prepared for some errors.
23:15  quesada: thanks John
23:15  quesada: one last thing. I have noremap <C-c> <C-v><C-c> and noremap <C-v> <C-v><C-v>
23:16  quesada: this is to emulate windows copy-paste. But it requires double keystrokes (ctrl-c twice). Is there a better way?
23:16  quesada: ie only one keystroke?
23:18  John-Galt: It's probably fixed in b5.
23:18  John-Galt: Or b4.3 even.
23:18  quesada: great! where do I get this? I thought I got the latest v... trice today :P
23:18  John-Galt: Where did you download from?
23:19  quesada: http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/index#sect-support
23:19  quesada: so b4.3 doesn't have it fixed
23:19  John-Galt: :extup Pentadactyl
23:20  quesada: not avail in FF 3.6.13
23:20  John-Galt: Ah, forgot about that.
23:20  quesada: should I get the nightly?
23:20  John-Galt: eris_prime: xpi 1.0b4.3
23:20  eris_prime: John-Galt :extadd http://dactyl.googlecode.com/files/pentadactyl-1.0b4.3.xpi
23:21  quesada: this is what I have? b4.3
23:21  John-Galt: :version
