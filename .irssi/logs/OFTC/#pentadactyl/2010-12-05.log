00:08  John-Galt: thesnowdog: If you want a free t-shirt: http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/02/firefox-4-tshirt/
00:08  John-Galt: I suppose you could desecrate it if you don't want to wear it, but any excuse to get Mozilla Inc to spend money on you, really...
00:16  thesnowdog: Heh, I think I can still get two. :)
00:16  John-Galt: Heh, I don't think it's one per add-on.
00:17  thesnowdog: Have you given up on add-on 'editing' yet or just gone quiet on the topic?
00:19  John-Galt: I've only done a couple this week, and I didn't have time last week. But the last review I started I just couldn't finish.
00:19  John-Galt: You have to see this thing. The toolbar, the preferences window, it's just plain insane. And it's guaranteed to be bug free!
00:20  John-Galt: I just had to disable another add-on that he was nominating.
00:20 * John-Galt makes screenshots.
00:21 * thesnowdog likes guaranteed software
00:21  John-Galt: Oh! I've just realized that it has a sidebar, too!
00:22  John-Galt: And a toolbar. And a statusbar icon, which has a menu identical to that in the context and Tools menus.
00:25  thesnowdog: You never know where you might be when you need the menu, makes sense.
00:26 * thesnowdog wonders if it's a good sign that he finds himself using zoom for the first time ever to read web pages.
00:27  stepnem: I've needed it lotsa times already; some pages are just broken.
00:28  thesnowdog: So I'm not getting old then? That's a relief...
00:30  John-Galt: http://maglione-k.users.sourceforge.net/is7/index.xhtml
00:31  John-Galt: I really need a script to rsync to my sf.net page. I always forget the proper incantation.
00:31  stepnem: hm, that looks a lot like the one you showed us the other day
00:32  stepnem: the one with the "Hello" button IIRC
00:32  John-Galt: It is, the difference being he finally included the whole thing.
00:32  John-Galt: And his other one was considerably worse.
00:34  John-Galt: Anyway, I'm not sure if I should reject it for just being such a bloody horribly confusing mess. I'll ask someone if it's still there on Monday.

12:46  Utopiah: hi #pentadactyl 
12:46  Utopiah: so... I know it's probably taboo but, since I had to recover from some FF crazyness I took the occasion to install Pentadactyl after saving up my Vimperator configuration files
12:47  Utopiah: so now Im wondering how I could load them back and if I actually should do so
12:53 * Utopiah is reading http://groups.google.com/group/pentadactyl/browse_thread/thread/e6b0aa2678b24d9e
12:57  thesnowdog: Utopiah: Hi.  In general that holds but probably less so over time...
12:58 * thesnowdog has honestly lost track of compatibility with the project whose name cannot be mentioned
13:03  Utopiah: yes I can imagine that's not your priority, yet I guess that's one of the first questions people think about when they consider switching
13:04 * Utopiah tries to rename his config files
13:08  Utopiah: (including the folder)
13:10  Utopiah: hmmm I guess my bindings with :js liberator() don't work anymore
13:12  thesnowdog: Utopiah: :echo liberator === dactyl
13:17  Utopiah: Error: util.copyToClipboard is not a function
13:17  Utopiah: Source File: [Command Line]
13:20  thesnowdog: Utopiah: Try the Yoda like clipboardWRite
13:21  thesnowdog: dactyl.clipboardWrite
13:22  Utopiah: (sidenote, the interface is now super responsive which seems great but since I have to learn it back, is a bit scary ;)
13:23  thesnowdog: That's all down to John-Galt 
13:23  thesnowdog: ...but there really aren't too many differences from a user perspective that should prove difficult - well not that I can recall. :)
13:24 * thesnowdog foolishly listens to some Mahler and forgets he's listening to anything
13:25  Utopiah: few regex on my config files should fix those problems
13:27  Utopiah: starting a http://fabien.benetou.fr/Tools/Vimperator#TransitionToPentadactyl
13:30  thesnowdog: Utopiah: That would be handy thanks.
13:32  Utopiah: it seems that I lost my quickmarks
13:34  Utopiah: I mean marks (whatever I do when I press gnW or goo)

13:39 --- Channel #pentadactyl was synced in 8 seconds
13:40  thesnowdog: Utopiah: Right the first time. Just add them again. Is there a .pentadactyl/info/{profile}/quickmarks file?
13:41  thesnowdog: ...and other evidence that the info/* files are being processed?
13:42  Utopiah: actually seems so, weird
13:43  Utopiah: local-marks has the current timestamp and gnW worked (just remapped it) but not goo which was a previous mapping
13:46  thesnowdog: gn/go work on quickmarks not local marks
13:46  Utopiah: btw when I start FF I have "E518: Unknown option: undefined"
13:48  Utopiah: ah yes, overwrote the quickmarks file and now it works, thanks!
13:51  Utopiah: it display that error in red and open the console following map | 2b/
13:51  Utopiah: map "\\" 1b/
13:52  Utopiah: maybe I should  map "|" 2b/ ?
13:58  Utopiah: ah, I think mkpentadactylrc! was actually important 
13:59  thesnowdog: :help :bar
14:00  Utopiah: no more error since I mkpentadactylrc and have the proper format
14:00  thesnowdog: Cool
14:00  Utopiah: guess Im pretty much all done now, Ill see by usage if there are other problems
14:05  Utopiah: out of curiosity, is there a way to lock tabs at a specific position and remove their name or should I re-install Tab Utilities?
14:08  thesnowdog: Only the App Tabs feature in FF 4
14:08  Utopiah: Im still on good old FF3.*
14:10  thesnowdog: I suppose we should add a :tablock command or similar...
14:11 * thesnowdog out of coffee so /me out
14:46  Utopiah: personal problem, I use autoscroll and since hint-links numbers are generated on display and not on DOM load, it changes all the time :/ is there a way to change that back to the old behavior?

17:27  John-Galt: Bastardly blue laws.
18:08  Utopiah: is quickhint raising any event I could catch in javascript?
20:00  stepnem:  I have a hard time coming up with a name for the utility function, and it's supposed to only be used on RegExps anyway.
20:02  stepnem: hm, that missed the interesting part -- I mean, RegExp.prototype.__defineGetter__("showableSource", function () this.source...))
20:03  stepnem: John-Galt:^
20:04  stepnem: and using that instead of source in the places where the output is supposed to be showed to the user
