00:05  Chousuke: iaj: If you're on OS X, I had some problems with b9. Fixed in minefield though.
00:06  iaj: Chousuke: I am actually - what problems?
00:11  John-Galt: Rendering glitches which don't have much to do with Pentadactyl.
00:27  iaj: rendering, of what?
00:28  John-Galt: Semi-opaque layers.
00:30  thesnowdog: Hmmm, no beta 4 announcement on dactyl.sf.net. :(
00:32  John-Galt: Well, I was waiting for AMO to approve it. I've just about written b4 off entirely.
00:46  Chousuke: iaj: you'll notice it if it happens :P
00:47  Chousuke: iaj: it's mostly just annoying
00:48  John-Galt: Didn't we have some horrible method for formatting byte counts?
00:48  John-Galt: Ah, there goes.
01:04  iaj: Chousuke: ok.. I'll see it sooner or later:)

01:15  thesnowdog: John-Galt: So what's the story?  Is the approval just on permanent hold or did that error provide a convenient excuse? :)
01:16  John-Galt: I think it was probably an excuse not to review it, to be honest. Anyway, b5's already in the queue.
01:16  John-Galt: b4.3's in the queue again for preliminary approval.
01:18  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I think you've said before you can just keep pushing the latest to that queue right? i.e. it might be b9 that they actually review?
01:22  John-Galt: Something like that. If you don't change the version number, you keep your place in the queue.

01:25  John-Galt: Donno. We've got over a thousand downloads from there already...
01:26  thesnowdog: ...we could be rebels without a cause.
01:26  John-Galt: Plus, I'm interested in taking users from that other project.
01:26  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Never let it be said you don't hold a grudge. ;-)
01:27  John-Galt: Heh. I just like to compete.
01:27  John-Galt: Well, I have a prototype MOW download manager.
01:27  thesnowdog: Oh, cool.
01:28  John-Galt: http://pastebin.com/JJyQC9r8
01:28  John-Galt: Still needs loads of work.
02:38  iaj: Hmm seems like I got something wrong... is there some way to move 3 tabs from the current one to the next, I mean some command with a <COUNT> prior? Tried gt,gT but those refer to the tabnumbers.
02:40  John-Galt: Nope.
02:40  John-Galt: Oh. Yes.
02:40  John-Galt: <C-n>/<C-p>
02:40  John-Galt: gT takes a relative count, though.
02:40  John-Galt: (this is all in :help, of course)
02:42  iaj: Hmm thanks man... but if I do a map < <C-p>  I can't use counts, unfort.
02:42  John-Galt: You can. You need to :map -count <lt> <count><C-p>
02:46  iaj: Hmmm.. sure?? I'm trying... I first tried <lt> but that acted strange.. so I came up with
02:46  iaj: map -count < -count <C-p>
02:46  John-Galt: That's completely wrong.
02:46  iaj: map -count <lt> -count <C-p>
02:46  iaj: didn't work :\
02:46  iaj: Omg.
02:46  iaj: sorry
02:47  John-Galt: :map -count <lt> <count><C-p>
02:47  iaj: its so late I read a -count at the end..
02:47  iaj: yeah.. I wondered already where the sense with that one is;)

09:06  heftig: tlonim: ^
09:06  tlonim: heftig: but for me undo does nothing
09:06  tlonim: opens nothing
09:07  heftig: then something else is broken
09:07  heftig: try a blank rofile
09:07  tlonim: ok
09:07  tlonim: should do that and check
09:08  Monkey: heftig: Thanks
09:09  tlonim: i wish they made panorama
09:09  tlonim: a compile time
09:09  tlonim: switch
09:09  tlonim: so that it can be disabled in builds and so on

09:11  heftig: so you can just opt not to use it

09:17  tlonim: anyone here tried building firefox with gstreamer ?
09:17  tlonim: the OSSv4 support of xulrunner is otherwise bad
09:17  tlonim: heftig: you use alsa or oss ?
09:27  heftig: alsa
09:28  tlonim: i made same changes as xulrunner-oss in my builds, but html5 audio is bad with it 
09:29  tlonim: i am not getting any sound with the gstreamer variant. come to think of it
09:30  tlonim: does gstreamer support webm ?
09:33  heftig: not yet AFAIK
09:36  tlonim: hm. may  be thats why

18:31  tlonim: John-Galt: i think according to what i read it may be

18:32  tlonim: did any variable change again in its type ?
18:54  Chousuke: John-Galt: Are you planning to allow full keyboard navigation of the new download manager?
18:55  Chousuke: it seems I can use hints on the downloads but that's not very useful since it just redownloads the thing :/
18:57  John-Galt: Possibly. Not a high priority.
18:57  John-Galt: You can use hints on the Filename portion, though.
18:57  Chousuke: being able to browse them with j/k and hitting keys to delete/stop/restart/whatever would be cool.
18:58  Chousuke: John-Galt: that's not very useful as it just redownloads the thing. :/
18:59  John-Galt: Would be cool for you. I don't especially care about it myself.
18:59  John-Galt: Chousuke: Hm. Well, it should give you an option to open it externally.
19:00  John-Galt: I might do something with one of the horrid helper services at some point, I guess. Maybe.
19:01  tlonim: Chousuke: i use hint based downloading
19:02  tlonim: Chousuke:  http://sprunge.us/FXBA is what I use
19:03  tlonim: since i use external downloaders like aria2c
19:03  Chousuke: tlonim: I'm talking about the new download list thingy in the nightlies
19:03  tlonim: Chousuke: oh.
19:04  tlonim: Chousuke: the :downloads ?
19:04  Chousuke: yeah
19:04  Chousuke: John-Galt: Maybe I'll even implement that stuff myself, if I can figure out how :P
19:04  tlonim: Chousuke: isnt that same as what download sidebar showed ?
19:08  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, getting "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIURI.port]" when I do close-tab on a new firefox instance
19:09  tlonim: i mean "delete current buffer" displays that message 
19:09  John-Galt: I don't think that's us.
19:10  tlonim: ok
19:41  John-Galt: Anyone feel like adding a 1-star review to this piece of garbage? https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/
19:44  tlonim: John-Galt: well. it is useful to override compatibility checks like the former nightly-tester addon.. or is there any other way to avoid the compatibility checks
19:45  John-Galt: :set! extensions.checkCompatibility.4.0b=false
19:46  tlonim: huh.. is that newly added ? the reason i installed that addon was only for that reason
19:46  John-Galt: No, it's been there for years now.
19:47  tlonim: John-Galt: then why was the nightly-tester addons there before ? or was this setting added after that addon was removed ?
19:48  tlonim: anyways.. removed that addon now :)
19:49  tlonim: one less addon is always better
19:50  John-Galt: Well, for one thing, it did other things, and for another, because it's a lot older than extensions.checkCompatibility.
19:52  tlonim: John-Galt: you are getting spammed by addon compatibility reports ? :D
19:52  John-Galt: Yes.
19:52  John-Galt: We all are.
19:53  tlonim: http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11/01/17/1737239/The-Ambiguity-of-Open-and-VP8-Vs-H264 this post has some mistake
19:54  tlonim: "Firefox, Opera and Google rely on their own media frameworks to decode video" only chromium does that I guess and firefox too atleast for sometime
19:54  tlonim: Firefox is going to use gstreamer atleast in future according to one bug
19:55  John-Galt: I think it's correct, actually.
19:56  tlonim: John-Galt: opera uses gstreamer ones
19:56  tlonim: chromium i am not sure
19:57  tlonim: in one of the comments it says
19:57  tlonim: "It's frustrating that only the OS-provided solutions (Safari and IE) are doing this right by handing it off to the OS. The notion that your browser needs to reimplement everything, including video rendering, is what leads to the bloatware we have today."
19:59  John-Galt: Hm. It might...
19:59  John-Galt: It might on Linux, anyway. It certainly doesn't elsewhere.
20:00  tlonim: ah..on others they may be using those DirectX stuff then
20:00  tlonim: but gstreamer is there for windows too i guess ?
20:00  John-Galt: You mean DirectShow and QuickTime?
20:01  John-Galt: Yes, there's a gstreamer for Windows, but it would be silly to require it to play media from something like Opera.
20:01 * John-Galt thinks DirectShow has been replaced, at that...
20:01  tlonim: John-Galt: yeah.. i mean the D3D apis and quicktime
20:02  tlonim: atleast the h264 on apple sites required quicktime
20:14  John-Galt: Why does Firefox always try to open downloads via wine?
20:18  tlonim: John-Galt: aha.. the wine app overwrites the mime database
20:18  tlonim: remove ~/.local/share/applications something
20:18  tlonim: John-Galt: OTOH it also reads ~/.mailcap which I have defined for all main types and that works 
20:19  John-Galt: Lame as all hell.
20:21  John-Galt: That's so fucking *stupid*.
20:21  tlonim: so i guess firefox reads mailcap first.. so it works out well for me 
20:22  tlonim: John-Galt: lol..
20:22  John-Galt: I think it uses some Gnome libarary if it can find it.
20:22  tlonim: how are you managing the mime handling on your system
20:22  tlonim: John-Galt: xdg-mime something i guess
20:22  John-Galt: Anyway, it doesn't seem to check .mailcap first for me, because I have image/png and I still got IE6 in wine.
20:23  John-Galt: Fuck if I know. I usually just launch things manually.
20:24  tlonim: John-Galt: remove the ~/.local/share/applications/* that should fix it
20:24  John-Galt: Yeah, I did.
20:24  tlonim: that directory is full of wine associations
20:24  tlonim: i think it is winecfg which creates them
20:24  tlonim: so packagers are not at fault here
20:25  John-Galt: Well, it doesn't launch wine anymore. Doesn't launch anything else either.
20:25  tlonim: John-Galt: aha. i think it uses xdg-open or gnome-open i think.. 
20:25  John-Galt: Oh, it launches gimp. NVM.
20:26  tlonim: John-Galt: we need a suckless app for global mime handling i guess :)
20:26  tlonim: there is a mimeo .. haven't tried that
20:27  John-Galt: No thanks.
20:27  tlonim: generally /etc/mime.types and mailcap suffice..but many apps ignore them
20:27  tlonim: John-Galt: where did you define the gimp association ? or was it automatic ?
20:28  John-Galt: It was automatic. :(
20:28  tlonim: the xdg mime thing is quite obscure..
20:30  John-Galt: The XDG everything is quite obscure. XDG is horrible.

21:44  John-Galt: Ugh.
21:45  John-Galt: Most of those keys don't work on my keyboard anyway. Half of them use some proprietary driver rather than key events.
21:46  tlonim: yeah..
21:46  tlonim: XF86Home also works
21:46  tlonim: goes to home page
21:47  John-Galt: So does gh. What's the point?

21:48  tlonim: nah..no poiny
21:48  tlonim: point*
21:48  tlonim: just stating that they have hardcoded those keybindings into firefox
21:48  tlonim: may be for windows users 
21:48  tlonim: where all those keys work
21:50  John-Galt: They don't all even work on Windows for me.
22:24  John-Galt: Damn it. Why do people send me messages on Facebook via email now?
22:25  Monkey: You mean they copy and paste them or is there  a cool "forward via email" feature?
22:25  Monkey: John-Galt: Clearly your friends just really want to stay in touch.
22:26  John-Galt: Er, wait, that came out completely wrong...
22:26  John-Galt: Damn it. Why do people send me messages on Facebook *instead of* via email now?
22:27  John-Galt: Although Facebook at least has the moderately good grace to forward them to my email account. Where I can't reply to them directly.
22:27  Monkey: Well that's because email is dead. I read it in the paper last week.
22:28  John-Galt: Nice to know. Having to go to crappy, slow, badly designed websites to reply to a message that I used to be able to reply to at a key press is a huge improvement, IMO.
22:29  Monkey: Why don't you just delete your account? I suspect you're a closet FB lover.
22:30  John-Galt: I probably should. But there are people I'll probably never be able to get in touch with again if I do. :(
22:30  Monkey: Sounds like a bonus.
22:33  John-Galt: For some of them... :)
