00:01  John-Galt: What's with all of the dups of issue 133? Is there some kind of recent trend or something? First issue 249, then 250, then 251? Wth?

13:30  iaj: lo there :)
13:30  iaj: can someone tell me where I can grab 4.0b7 of firefox - since b8 is fairly unstable for me as it seems :/ 
13:49 * thesnowdog wonders how he got through life without hearing The Osmonds "Crazy Horses" - tweet
14:03  thesnowdog: iaj: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/4.0b7/
14:04 * thesnowdog has Crazy Horses stuck in his head, oh sweet jesus
14:06  iaj: thesnowdog: thanks... :O
15:55 * John-Galt is somewhat disturbed that thesnowdog is mentioning The Osmonds...
15:56  John-Galt: stepnem: Ah! So that's what happened to my generated RC!
15:56  stepnem: Sounds likely, yeah.
15:57  John-Galt: Worst summary ever, indeed...
15:58  tlonim: any of you running mplayer in a slave mode ?
15:58  stepnem: tlonim: Yeah.
15:59  tlonim: stepnem: how do you detect end of play ?
15:59  tlonim: I mean if I need to callback 
15:59  tlonim: "is there a way to detect when a video has ended in slave mode -- currently I am checking the logs(can be error prone) or checking whether a mplayer window exists(won't work with fixed-vo)"
15:59  stepnem: I don't know. Never needed that. It just exits.
16:00  tlonim: I do queueing etc.. :)
16:01  stepnem: Well I do, too, but I have an Emacs music player to manage that part. ;-)
16:01  tlonim: hmm
16:01  tlonim: emacs music player 
16:01  tlonim: is it like mpd ?
16:01  tlonim: but can do both video and audio  
16:01  tlonim: mpd as in like ncmpcpp
16:01  stepnem: It's just a front end. You can also use it with mpd, yeah. I use mplayer.
16:02  stepnem: It abstracts over various music players.
16:02  tlonim: stepnem: can you use both with that ? based on whether audio or video I mean
16:02  stepnem: Yes.
16:02  tlonim: cool
16:02  tlonim: emacs is like a OS :P
16:02  stepnem: Yup.
16:04  tlonim: I liked org-mode in emacs .. nice feature.. but learning emacs for a vim user is another learning curve ..
16:05  stepnem: Maybe. I don't know what all that fuss about learning curves means. You just read the documentation and pick up things as you go.
16:05  tlonim: stepnem: emacs is your primary editor ?
16:06  stepnem: Yes.
16:06  stepnem: It's my primary everything, except web browsing ;-)
16:06  tlonim: I am too used modal editor..
16:06  tlonim: stepnem: the emacs-w3m is nice too ..isnt it
16:06  stepnem: Sure, I have an Emacs library for that.
16:07  stepnem: emacs-w3m is OK, but for some sites you need JS and similar crap.
16:08  tlonim: yeah..for those sites firefox :)
16:08  tlonim: 'M' in w3m opens it in primary browser
16:09  tlonim: another thing I liked about emacs is command line completion is better than vim's 
16:10  tlonim: stepnem: i wish there was something like mpd for mplayer ..with daemon and all
16:10  tlonim: so I can do nice stuff rather than hacky slave mode
16:11  stepnem: Why don't you just use mpd? It doesn't do video? 
16:11  tlonim: nope
16:12  tlonim: stepnem: it has a generic decoder thing which is again restricted since decoder has to give raw pcm only 
16:12  stepnem: You can use emacs --daemon ;-)
16:43  John-Galt: Ugh. Some editor flagged Pentadactyl for admin review "because it's a JetPack add-on now"
16:45  graffatcolmingov: o_O?
16:46  John-Galt: Yeah, that.
16:48  tlonim: admin of addons.mozilla ?
16:49  John-Galt: Something like that...
16:50  graffatcolmingov: Are the admin at least more intelligent that said editor?
16:50  John-Galt: Yes.
16:51  graffatcolmingov: Then they'll realize that editor is wasting their time and possibly remove his status?
16:52  John-Galt: I can probably get someone to fix it.

19:03  ChrisBuchholz: Hi guys. I am trying out pentadactyl, and was just going about bookmarking a page. I used :bmark, and the "statusbar" says the page is bookmarkede, but i cant find it in the bookmark dialog. Where is it bookmarked to?
19:04  stepnem: ChrisBuchholz: Unfiled Bookmarks I'd say
19:04  ChrisBuchholz: stepnem: do you mean unsorted bookmarks, or?
19:04  ChrisBuchholz: i dont see it there, though
19:05  ChrisBuchholz: stepnem: okay, i just bookmarked another page with the -title argument, and it showed up
19:06  ChrisBuchholz: thank you for the help
19:06  stepnem: ChrisBuchholz: So it's "Unsorted Bookmarks" these days?
19:06  John-Galt: Unfiled
19:06  ChrisBuchholz: stepnem: on my install, it is, anyways
19:07  stepnem: Depends on the locale I guess.
19:07  John-Galt: Oh. They did change it. Lame.

19:36  tlonim: is there something like hybrid folds in vim ?
19:37  John-Galt: O.o
19:37 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 6a8d60e97669e6b6b588591d942154dd0d9194db /common/content/dactyl.js Fix dactyl.initHelp.
19:44  stepnem: I somewhat corrected and consistood some of the marks code: http://pastebin.com/cY1viCZW The FIXME probably needs fixing, though. Otherwise it should be uncontroversial.
19:44  stepnem: The problem is that we persist URL marks (the upcase) ones, but they're no use after restart. So I just added a clause that opens them in a new tab.
19:45  tlonim: John-Galt: like synatx based folding but it should also recognise my own marker folds
19:46  John-Galt: stepnem: Looks alright for the most part (but I'm a bit distracted), but I don't see the point of turning the filter into a regex pattern. How is it better than what we currently do?
19:47  stepnem: John-Galt: Currently we don't really accept ranges in most of the commands, even though we do advertise that.
19:47  stepnem: e.g. :delmarks a-i
19:47  stepnem: That's kinda the main point of this patch.
19:47  stepnem: To accept ranges, also for the listing commands.

21:03  John-Galt: Bloody fucking Minefield broke :rehash.
21:30  stepnem: OK. This seems to work fine: http://pastebin.com/xcu9yUst
21:31  stepnem: One slight drawback is that because the validation is now all done in the utility function, a normal assertion error is shown instead of some EXXX.
21:35  John-Galt: That's fine.
21:40  stepnem: The thing with URL marks is that the `tab' property is null when serialised. I guess TRTTD would be after restart to try to find a tab matching the URL and jump to it, or else open it in a new tab (and update the tab property in the URL mark).
21:41  John-Galt: That's fine. It's checked for null.
21:41  stepnem: Well, it is, but nothing happens in that case. I simply added a clause to open the URL in a new tab.
21:42  stepnem: But that doesn't update the mark, so it will open the URL in yet another tab next time.
21:42  stepnem: s/nothing happens/error is signaled/
21:43  John-Galt: Ok.
21:56  John-Galt: stepnem: Feel free to commit it. I'll look over the urlmarks after session restore stuff more later. I've got too much in my current patch to look at it now.
21:56  stepnem: John-Galt: OK, thanks.
22:31  Rasi: hi
22:31  Rasi: quick question: is it possible to make use of the password manager in firefox, when the tabbar is hidden?
22:31  Rasi: or whatever bar makes the pop-up appear
22:32  John-Galt: I'd imagine so.
22:32  Rasi: well if no pop up appears how can i make it remember my pass? :P
22:32  John-Galt: It has nothing to do with the tab bar.
22:32  Rasi: i've read the popup is bound to one of the bars
22:32  Rasi: might be the addressbar
22:32  Rasi: not sure
22:32  John-Galt: No, it's not.
22:32  Rasi: in ff4
22:33  John-Galt: I know.
22:33  Rasi: hmm
22:33  Rasi: then i have no clue
22:33  Rasi: without penta it nicely asks me to store the password
22:34  John-Galt: Interesting...
22:34  Rasi: what was the command again to quickly show the awesomebar?
22:34  John-Galt: Awesomebar?
22:34  Rasi: well the addressbar
22:34  John-Galt: Probably :set go!=T
22:35  Rasi: yes
22:35  Rasi: works now
22:35  Rasi: but if i disable it, it doesnt
22:35  Rasi: the pop up is definately bound to the addressbar
22:36  Rasi: it even is connected to it visually
22:36  John-Galt: Ok. I didn't think they'd moved to the doorknocker system yet. Can you possibly send me a screenshot? I have the password manager disabled.
22:37  Rasi: sure...
22:38  Rasi: http://paste.xinu.at/kaDh/
22:39  Rasi: maybe i should start using something like keepassx
22:39  Rasi: :P
22:40  John-Galt: Weird. I get those horrible modal panels with the location bar hidden all the time.
22:40  John-Galt: I s'pose I'll have to drag the thing into the add-on bar, then.
22:42  John-Galt: Rasi: Try this :js statusline.statusBar.appendChild(document.getElementById("notification-popup-box"))
22:43  Rasi: yea
22:43  Rasi: working
22:43  Rasi: how can i make this permanent?
22:43  Rasi: set js statusline.statusBar.appendChild(document.getElementById("notification-popup-box")) ?
22:44  John-Galt: You can add it to your .pentadactylrc.
22:44  John-Galt: I suppose I'll have to do it automatically when the location bar is hidden.

23:21  ctruett: hello all
23:22  ctruett: I've just picked up Pentadactyl, but I'm having some trouble figuring out how to get to text fields using just the keyboard
23:22  ctruett: I've tried getting into them with hints, and with insert mode navigation, but on several sites it appears to ignore the text areas
23:22  ctruett: s/areas/ inputs boxes
23:23  ctruett: Anyone know how I can solve this?
