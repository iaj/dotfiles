23:06  graffatcolmingov: Quick question: Is there a way to get the system type (i.e. linux, windows) via a js command?
23:07  John-Galt: Yes.
23:08  graffatcolmingov: Care to share?
23:09  thesnowdog: graffatcolmingov: Go fishing in util.jsm
23:09  graffatcolmingov: Awesome, thanks thesnowdog 
23:11  John-Galt: Umm... Is it just me, or is :normal not so much :normal as :feedkeys?
23:11  John-Galt: Because I'm pretty sure it's :feedkeys
23:13  Chousuke: hmmh
23:13  Chousuke: why on earth is firefox not showing me my addons in the addons tab
23:13  Chousuke: they work just fine
23:13  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You just mean it should be renamed? THen yes, I've never much liked it.
23:14  John-Galt: thesnowdog: No, I mean that it should do what it purports to do.
23:14  John-Galt: Or at least, we should have a command that executes keys in whatever mode we want.
23:14  John-Galt: :map -m hints k -ex normal k should *not* cause an infinite loop.
23:16  thesnowdog: I'm a bit lost. Isn't it purporting to execute normal mode commands only?
23:16  John-Galt: Yes, but that's not what it does.
23:17  thesnowdog: Missed teh example as usual. Hmmm
23:20  thesnowdog: Seems to do the same in Vim doesn't it?
23:21  thesnowdog: Yep, another faithful reproduction of Vim behaviour.
23:21  John-Galt: It may well do...
23:21 * thesnowdog trys to recover his CPU
23:21  Chousuke: :-( what the hell does firefox think noscript is if not an addon
23:21  John-Galt: Heh
23:21  John-Galt: Chousuke: An add-on.
23:22  Chousuke: same thing
23:22  Chousuke: anyway, why does it tell me none of those are installed
23:22  Chousuke: yet I am using them
23:22  John-Galt: Donno. Maybe you have a search string? Works for me.
23:22  John-Galt: Plus, there's always :exts
23:23  Chousuke: that lists nothing as well
23:23  John-Galt: Hm. Guess you're fucked, then. Try a fresh profile.
23:23  Chousuke: gjkfjgkdjgksjfkljldjf
23:23  thesnowdog: No, dlajflajsdlfjdsa
23:24  Chousuke: I think I'll just poke a bit at the profile directory
23:24  Chousuke: that sometimes helps
