13:03  DarkDefender: Is there any nice font select option for the text generated by dactyl? Rigth now i have to hardcode it in the theme I'm using or change the default monospace font used by firefox.
13:05  iaj: DarkDefender: dunno... what's your setting looking like?
13:05  DarkDefender: in firefox or the theme?
13:07  DarkDefender: I'm just wondering if there is (or perhaps will be ;) ) an option for setting font and size for the text displayed by dactyl
13:08  DarkDefender: would be nice if there was an "set guifont" option like in gvim/vim
13:16  DarkDefender: That you you can easily change font and size to whatever you like. And still keep the default options for themes and/or firefox font settings
13:48  iaj: in the theme actually - the text that's created by dactyl that is
13:48  iaj: you got a line in your pentrc for that don't you?
13:48  iaj: DarkDefender^ 
13:50  DarkDefender: no, I change the font family in the theme file ATM
