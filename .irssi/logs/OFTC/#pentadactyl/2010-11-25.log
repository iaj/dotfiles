08:51  sp3ctum: anon33_: what do you mean by tree style tabs?
08:51  sp3ctum: i don't usually use the buffer menu, unless i have a lot of tabs open
09:21  tlonim: anon33_: that would be nice if someone does it 
09:21  tlonim: if there are a lot of tabs in the buftabs it can become cumbersome
11:00  John-Galt: Well, one pie in the oven... Only about 8 dishes to go...
11:01 * John-Galt wonders if he can get a couple of hours sleep before he has to start the turkey...
11:04  thesnowdog: anon33_: That's not the worst idea in the world at all. As to whether it should be a default feature or not I don't really have an opinion.
11:04  thesnowdog: We've been meaning to add a configurable statusline for a long time but haven't.  Presumably because none of us really miss it...
11:04  thesnowdog: As John-Galt won't be able to sleep anyway perhaps he'll implement it for you before the turkey calls.
11:05  John-Galt: Heh. I intend to try to sleep when the first pie and cornbread are done.
11:06  thesnowdog: anon33_: Implementing your particular request would be straight forward if you have some programming skills.  You could make yourself a plugin in the short term.
11:06 * thesnowdog watches the final episode of Luther
11:06 * thesnowdog wants a pet serial killer too
11:07  John-Galt: Wow. I'm too damned tired. I've made cornbread hundreds of times, and now I can't even think what to do...
11:07  John-Galt: Not goodness.
11:10  John-Galt: Screw it. I'll just start and I'm sure the rest will come to me.
11:11  thesnowdog: John-Galt must really love his sister
11:30  John-Galt: It's not for her. It's a holiday, and I'll be damned if I'm going to make a half-assed attempt at a meal when I'm serving a dozen people.
11:31  John-Galt: Two of whom, apparently, don't eat anything that's not boxed macaroni and cheese or microwaved hot dogs.
11:31  sp3ctum: ugh
11:49 * John-Galt hopes that the beer store is open tomorrow...
12:47  damnick: Hi, does pentadactyl works with the delicious addon? Because when i try to :open it suggest me only my local bookmarks and not my delicious bookmarks.
15:13  peth: is it normal that :bd switches to the buffer # i just deleted?
15:15  peth: (1.0b3 on 3.6.12)
15:17  stepnem: peth: well it always tries to select the tab to the right of the deleted one(s)
15:18  stepnem: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, though.
15:25  peth: ok, ok. that's what i meant. say i'm on buffer 10 and :bd 5. now i'm on buffer #5. i'm not used to that from vim.
15:26  peth: thanks (and that was supposed to be "oh, ok"
15:28  Chousuke: ghgh this firefox 32-bit slowness crap is annoying
15:29  Chousuke: it *doesn't* manifest in safe mode but *does* manifest with a clean profile
15:29  stepnem: peth: What does Vim do in that case? Doesn't change the selected buffer?
15:29  peth: iirc yes
15:29  stepnem: that would make more sense to me as well, yeah (but I never use :bd)
15:29  tlonim: Chousuke: only 32 bit ?
15:29  stepnem: (with an argument)
15:30  Chousuke: tlonim: yeah
15:30  Chousuke: tlonim: also tried disabling all plugins, no effect :/
15:34  stepnem: thesnowdog, John-Galt: shouldn't we make ':bd [arg]' just delete the tabs without changing the selected one?
15:34  Chousuke: Also there doesn't seem to be nightlies older than october for OS X so I can't find a version where it doesn't appear.
15:35  Chousuke: oh wait, there are tracemonkey builds
15:35  Chousuke: hmm
15:49 --- michael is now known as Guest466
15:49 --- Guest466 is now known as qotsa
16:11  stepnem: peth: IIUC this simple change should DTRT: http://pastebin.com/UvgV9VFz
16:17  peth: stepnem: oh nice! will i have to re-apply this, or does this go into the repo?
16:17  stepnem: peth: just apply it as a patch against the repository
16:17  zeltak:  /server add minbif
16:17  peth: alright, thanks!
16:18  zeltak: oops sorry
16:21  John-Galt: Well, I managed to get three hours of sleep or so...
16:25 * John-Galt could use some sleep.
16:26  DarkDefender: sleep(5);
16:27  DarkDefender: ;)
16:30  John-Galt: Tried sleep 5h; Didn't happen so much.
16:30  John-Galt: Coffee time.
16:32  John-Galt: CO-HOST: How would you handle a situation like the one that just developed in North Korea? [...]
16:33  John-Galt: Hm...
16:33  Chousuke: Hooray, managed to narrow the problem between 2010-09-29 and 2010-10-01. Now I just have to hope some Firefox dev figures out something magical :P
16:33  John-Galt: CO-HOST : How would you handle a situation like the one that just developed in North Korea? [...]
16:33  John-Galt: PALIN : But obviously, we've got to stand with our North Korean allies. We're bound to by treaty -
16:33  John-Galt: There we go. Stupid scripts.
16:34 * John-Galt wasn't aware that :bd switched buffers at all.
16:36  DarkDefender: North Korean _allies_ ?
16:37  DarkDefender: I wouldn't remotely call the north allies :P
16:37  John-Galt: Yeah, she's a bit special. I wish her luck in the primaries, though.
