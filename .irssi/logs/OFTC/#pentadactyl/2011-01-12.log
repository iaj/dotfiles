04:53  thesnowdog: "you can't set the bar this high"...really?
04:54  John-Galt: I know. And I thought I was cynical.
04:56  tlonim: John-Galt: which addon is it anyways
04:57  John-Galt: Donno. Some video downloader or something, I think. I reviewed that one a day or two ago.
04:58  John-Galt: Yeah. Video DownloadHelper (must be German...)
04:59  tlonim: there are many far too many video downloader addons actually.. and some of them even may be crapwares..
05:00  John-Galt: This is true. Most of them are crapware. We're not even allowed to accept new ones anymore.
05:01  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, if an addon has changed a firefox setting/theme, it is not a standard process to revert it when that addon is disabled/removed ?
05:02  tlonim: some addons I have used in past just left settings as is for me to figure out and revert back
05:03  tlonim: i think it was those tab addons with session features..
05:03  John-Galt: Yeah, add-ons aren't allowed to leave any residue.
05:04  tlonim: i think it is tabmix plus.. it does more than tab stuff :D
05:04  John-Galt: It's aweful.
05:04  tlonim: yeah
05:05  tlonim: after i removed it, both my session mgmt and tab stuff were in mess
05:07  tlonim: John-Galt: also, some addons like noscript store all thier site list(which can be really long) in prefs.js itself which clutters it further. Arent addons allowed a separate config store ?
05:09  John-Galt: Sure, they can use their own SQLite or RDF databases, if they want. NoScript should really probably use the permissions service.
05:22  Maahes: Um, since what I'm trying to do isn't working, I'm to take it that you cannot assign javascript to a qmark?
05:22  John-Galt: You can.

06:02  Maahes: John-Galt: I press it, and all I get is the "did not work" sound, I don't even have noscript installed yet
06:02  John-Galt: ‘"did not work" sound’?
06:03  John-Galt: :qmark x javascript:(function () { document.body.style.background="black"; })()
06:03  John-Galt: gox
06:03  John-Galt: Gives me a black background.
06:05  Maahes: John-Galt: that's gos (I set it to s) not :go s right? cause I just did gos and it actually did something this time, which is warn me that I was going to open 54 tabs, which is not what this javascript does
06:06  John-Galt: Right, just gos. However, I suspect that you've run into 'urlsep' silliness.
06:06  John-Galt: Best to just disable it, really. It's an aweful feature.
06:07  John-Galt: Although you must be using a fairly old Pentadactyl if the default value is still ","
06:07  Maahes: no it's \
06:07  Maahes: and |
06:07  Maahes: this javascript generates md5 hashes
06:08  John-Galt: Interesting. I thought it had to be separated by spaces.
06:08  Maahes: just doing :set urlseperator=      work?
06:08  John-Galt: Anyway, just disable it. It's horrible. Donno why you'd use a bookmarklet to generate an MD5 sum, though. There's nsICryptoHash available to native code.
06:08  John-Galt: Yes.
06:08  Maahes: John-Galt: it's my portable password generator
06:09  Maahes: works even on computers I don't have install rights to
06:09  John-Galt: Ok...
06:09  tlonim: John-Galt: the qmark  js can use chrome/gecko functions too right ?
06:09  John-Galt: tlonim: Of course not. It runs in the page context.
06:09  tlonim: John-Galt: ok
06:10  John-Galt: You could create a normal mapping or command which could, though.
06:10  Maahes: as long as the device can do javascript I create hard (and distinct, for each and every website) passwords for any site I visit, without having to remember any of them
06:10  Maahes: mostly its the distinct passwords that's useful
06:10  tlonim: Maahes: how do you reproduc/remembere them ? 
06:11  Maahes: tlonim: they're generated from the url and a masterpassword
06:12  Maahes: which is not stored.
06:12  Maahes: It's more secure, but not absolutely secure. It is however secure in the sense that its compabible with human nature and portable across devices.
06:13  tlonim: Maahes: interesting...
06:15  Maahes: I use supergenpass. from supergenpass.com. They have a bookmarklet you can install, and then a url you can use on mobile devices, to generate your passwords, client side javascript

I a have a global dark style that's interfering with it, and because stylish is a fucking stupid program I can't trouble shoot it.

09:36  stepnem: "no, stupid code is no reason for rejection", "you can't set the bar this hight"
09:36  stepnem: heh heh heh
09:36  stepnem: Ah, I see thesnowdog quoted the very same thing, haha.
09:40  stepnem: Maahes: Have you tried add !important to the rules?
09:40  stepnem: adding*
09:41  stepnem: BTW, if you consider Stylish a fucking stupid program, why don't you just use the :style command. 
09:42  Maahes: stepnem: I'm only now considering it stupid, it has worked fine in the past
09:42  Maahes: I however might be missing something, in css: /*  multiple lines of text */ comments out everything between it right?
09:47  stepnem: Yes.
10:35  stepnem: John-Galt: I now get "pentadactyl: load overlays <url>" message in the console for every web site I go to; is that intentional?
11:35  thesnowdog: Hmmm, is the ' mark broken? :( 
11:36  stepnem: thesnowdog: Did it ever work? That'd be surprising to me...
11:36  stepnem: I didn't see any code that would indicate that.
11:38  thesnowdog: Yeah, it worked.  I use it regularly.  It looks like John-Galt removed it during a refactoring. :( I'll fix it later.
11:39  stepnem: Well, then I think I'm at least partially responsible. I removed ' and " from the isLocalMark check, because I saw that actually only a-zA-Z were accepted. I guess I must have missed something in jumpToMark that made it work.
11:40  stepnem: Blech.
11:41  stepnem: I mean ' and `.
11:41  stepnem: thesnowdog: 9db7093e6dcc
11:43  stepnem: thesnowdog: I saw this: "dactyl.assert(/[a-zA-Z]/.test(mark),     "E191: Argument must be a letter or forward/backward quote"); ", which just didn't make any sense to me, and the '` marks didn't seem to work to me, so I assumed they just didn't.
11:43  stepnem: I guess some of the jumpTo convolution must have made it work somehow then...
11:46  stepnem: Same with 0-9 for URL marks. From what I could see 0-9 could only work for quickmarks.
11:50  thesnowdog: stepnem: It didn't work by the time you got to it 5246:b916bcc6fc84.  Although it all seems a bit like the ' mark apocalypse and I can't be arsed thinking about it right at the moment. :)
11:50  stepnem: Ah, I see.
11:50  thesnowdog: scrollTo used to set it.
14:28 * thesnowdog thinks we should really either commit to keeping teledactyl and melodactyl up to date or delete them (at least from the website) before they bit rot into oblivion -- it's a kinder death

15:41  John-Galt: Huh? The -m=hints part doesn't make sense.
15:41  stepnem: How so? For exchanging ;f and ;F?
15:42  stepnem: Isn't hints mode supposed to be in effect after pressing ;?

16:25  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Heh. Sorry. I have to look at more of it...
16:26  John-Galt: At least I didn't show you the one that tries to assign to var twiends-o-matic and didn't seem concerned that it didn't work at all before he submitted it.
16:26  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I think you should approve it as indictment of the AMO review system
16:27  John-Galt: Heh. No-one would care.
16:27  John-Galt: I prefer to reject things until I get yelled at for it.
16:27  thesnowdog: Who yells? The author or admin editors?
16:28  John-Galt: OMFG, the add-on builder is so fucked. If you tell it to use the namespace foo-addon, it obligingly generates code that assigns to the global variable foo-addon
16:28  stepnem: Both I'm sure. After seeing that IRC excerpt...
16:28  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Well, they don't yell. Yelling is more fun. But admins, yeay.
16:28  John-Galt: *yeah
16:29  John-Galt: The authors sometimes, too, although oddly they tend to thank me when I reject their add-ons...
16:30  tlonim: John-Galt: may be that is reverse psychology
16:30  tlonim: that you will accept it next time since they thanked you :)
16:30  John-Galt: And it generates code like this, which aside from being broken as mentioned, assigns properties to the global window rather than the namespace object: http://pastebin.com/B3MPQZ9t
16:31  John-Galt: I've lost count of how many add-ons I've rejected for that.
16:31  John-Galt: tlonim: Possibly, although if they think that, they're barking up the wrong tree.
16:31  tlonim: isn't there something like a common test suite for all addons ?
16:31  tlonim: John-Galt: hehe
16:32  John-Galt: Not so much. There's a validator. It's a horrible hack, though. Just runs a bunch of regexps against the thing.

18:36  thesnowdog: John-Galt: you're not suggesting you need to use that create_function though are you?
18:37  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Possibly, for preg_replace_callback. Although presumably there's some way to pass a function reference?

20:33  John-Galt: Speaking of going outside, it's a generally crappy day and I think I'm going to go for a walk as soon as I finish my soup.

20:47  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Good. You'd be happier to keep it that way.
20:48  DarkDefender: I can't get enough of the democrat republican flamewars on /new/ :P
20:48  John-Galt: Although, think Efnet without the good bits.
20:48  John-Galt: (does EfNet have good bits?)
20:49  tlonim: efnet is good for what types ? scene releases etc right ?
20:49  John-Galt: Who knows? That's what BitTorrent is for.
20:50  DarkDefender: well in most channels you'll get banned for passing the wrong args to the dlbot :P
20:50  DarkDefender: but i agree bittorrent is where it's at

21:00  John-Galt: Heh. That's people for you. What happened to good, old-fasioned, honest looting?
21:02  thesnowdog: Yeah, that's pretty much what the copper said. He seemed most offended by the justification. :)
21:02  John-Galt: :)
21:02  tlonim: are there high casualties ?
21:04  thesnowdog: tlonim: About a dozen with an ever decreasing number of missing people of about 50.  The press seem unable to hide there disappointment as people are located safe and well.
