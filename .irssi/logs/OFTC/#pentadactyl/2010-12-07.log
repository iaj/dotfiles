15:37  sp3ctum: i'm getting odd behaviour when ;s -saving iso images on osx
15:38  sp3ctum: the files are saved to ~/Downloads normally but they have an .iso.exe -extension
15:39  sp3ctum: i'm not sure if that is something firefox does on osx since i'm completely new at osx myself
15:45  sp3ctum: the files are iso files and they work though
15:45  Utopiah: if it's happening even without pentadactyl enabled, maybe asking in #firefox on mozilla network would be more efficient
15:47  sp3ctum: i haven't tested yet but will probably do so later
16:18  anon33_: :( is Kris not here?
18:09  iaj: hmmm is there any issue with invoking the :he ?
18:09  iaj: for me its returning an empty page
18:10  iaj: im getting the: chrome://dactyl/content/commands.js:618: TypeError: array.nth is not a function   error a lot...
18:28  awwaiid: Greetings!
18:30  iaj: lo there.
18:30  Utopiah: welcome
18:30  awwaiid: I am running the latest pentadactyl release, and just like the vimperator I was using before I have an issue -- I want to record a macro to refresh the current tab and then move to the next. which works. but then I want to execute it 5 times, and it only does it once.
18:31  awwaiid: keypresses: q a r ctrl-n q (to record the macro, then) 5 @ a
18:31  awwaiid: anyone else have this problem, or is it just me? :)
18:32  awwaiid: actually I take that back, in pentadactyl the macro doesn't do the ctrl-n (though I thought it did in vimperator)
18:38  iaj: someone around.. im having trouble I simply want to be <C-p> to act the same way <Up> does..
18:39  iaj: thus I got cnoremap <C-p> <Up> in my pentadactylrc. however its not working as it should
18:39  iaj: any help?
18:40  awwaiid: I just tried it and it works
18:40  awwaiid: in the browser, not in my config
18:41  awwaiid: (running v1b3)
18:43  iaj: yeah seems to be not loaded.. my .r
18:43  iaj: .rc .. but no errors at all on startup

18:45  iaj: :messages ain't working as well - gna
18:51  iaj: awwaiid: which minefield are you using?
18:54  iaj: hmmmmm it seems like my .rc gets sourced after all - without errors.. however I can't get map <   map > to run :(
18:58  iaj: omeone up using the latest HG + nightly FF?
19:37  peth: iaj: are your mappings in :cmap ?
19:38  peth: try map -modes=c <C-p> -builtin <Up>
19:38  iaj: i downgraded to 4902 now - its working there :(
19:38  iaj: peth: hmmm but :buffer! foobar
19:38  iaj: didn't work as well in the recent version
19:41  iaj: peth:  is :buffer working for you?
19:42  peth: no problems here
19:42  peth: but John-Galt mentioned something earlier
19:42  iaj: you are using most recent?  chrome://dactyl/content/tabs.js:435: TypeError: t.linkedBrowser.lastURI is null  is my error message
19:43  peth: see backlog around 3:50 UTC
19:43  peth: if you were there then?
19:44  peth: i'm not using latest
19:44  iaj: nah I wasn't :(
19:44  peth: hold on
19:44  iaj: peth: Oh.. its happening since 4903
19:44  iaj: it seems
19:44  iaj: >4903 even
19:47  peth: iaj: http://pastebin.com/EiwEBbYv <-- that's what i meant, don't know if that's what you meant, though :)
19:49  iaj: peth: thanks..well at least that issue is discussed - a bit there
