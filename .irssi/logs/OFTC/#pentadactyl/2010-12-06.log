00:43  stepnem: John-Galt: yeah, I thought maybe the overcomp^Wsophisticated module/classes system would provide some solution to have the cake and eat it too
00:52  John-Galt: stepnem: It might if you export the RegExp object from base.jsm
00:57  stepnem: John-Galt: Just add RegExp to base module exports and then add the getter in base.jsm as above? Or do I have to also actually define a RegExp class extending the builtin RegExp somehow?
00:58  John-Galt: The first one.
00:59  stepnem: hm, interesting

02:16  John-Galt: stepnem: It'll only work for RegExp objects created via the RegExp constructor, and not from the command line unless you do modules.RegExp.
02:17  John-Galt: The Sandbox object provides its own RegExp property that takes precedence.
02:17  stepnem: ah...
02:18  stepnem: Thanks!
02:18  John-Galt: Sure.
02:19 * John-Galt thinks he out to just ask the liquor store girl out so he can occasionally visit a different liquor store.
02:19  stepnem: :-)
02:48  stepnem: John-Galt: I'm probably an idiot, but with this http://pastebin.com/MW239sw2 I'm still getting errors about showableSource not being defined
02:49  stepnem: I thought that it would work, given that the pattern is created with Option.parseRegexp, which calls RegExp
02:54  John-Galt: Looks like more TraceMonkey bugginess to me.
02:57  stepnem: I guess I'll just go with util.regexpSource for the time being then... it's only those three places anyway.
03:05  John-Galt: Wow. Sam Adams Imperial Stout is really good. I can't believe I haven't tried it before.
03:05  John-Galt: And 9.2% ABV, too.
03:07  thesnowdog: Beer < MotoGP
03:07  John-Galt: Beer >> MotoGP
03:08 * John-Galt has occasionally considered starting a brew pub.
03:09  stepnem: Looks OK? http://pastebin.com/5MRYMwUq
03:10  John-Galt: Fine with me. thesnowdog ?
03:21  John-Galt: Well, I suppose that you can always commit it and wait for thesnowdog to decide he doesn't like the name and fix it.
03:23  stepnem: Yeah, I don't mind waiting a while either, there's no hurry with this.
03:31  John-Galt: Damn. I'm really regretting not asking her for her number now.
03:32 * John-Galt glances obliquely at the topic.
03:47  thesnowdog: stepnem: Sure, though it might be nice if we could aggregate these re enhancements like we do for array.
03:48  stepnem: thesnowdog: well, I wanted to provide a showableSource getter on RegExp, but it didn't work out
03:48 * thesnowdog wonders if #pentadactyl will turn into forum for discussing the pressures of life with "a girlfriend" like #vimperator
03:49  stepnem: (see the first paste above)
03:49  stepnem: (the second one in reverse order)
03:49  thesnowdog: John-Galt: The first time you say you can't code anymore because of some woman I'm out of here.
03:49  John-Galt: thesnowdog: No. And I'll personally kick anyone who tries to make it so.
03:49  John-Galt: Even if it's myself.
03:51  John-Galt: The problem of course being that beer that's 9.2% ABV tends to make one unduly reminiscent of the cute girl who was unusually smily when you bought it from her.
03:52  John-Galt: Smilie? Hm... Smiley?
03:52  stepnem: I guess making our own regexp similar to array would be an option, but given that this seems to be the first and only RegExp enhancement so far, it seems like an overkill.
03:52  thesnowdog: stepnem: there's an escape too I think and maybe others
03:53  John-Galt: Yep, there's makeRegexp, or something, too.
03:53  stepnem: util.regexp
03:53  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Ah yes, the "my girlfriend works at Starbucks" syndrome.
03:53  John-Galt: Er, just util.regexp, then.
03:53  thesnowdog: ..."she smiles at me every day"
03:53  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Coffee doesn't have the same effect as alcohol.
03:54 * thesnowdog was disturbed to see we still have a Starbucks in Sydney. I thought they'd all been nuked.
03:55  John-Galt: At any rate, there are different kinds of smiles, and most cashiers don't smile much. And this one didn't smile at the person in line before me.
03:55  John-Galt: Anyway, /me glares pointedly at the topic.
03:55  thesnowdog: The Athena was rather a disappointment.  Not how I'd choose to spend $100 mill... And all the girls were fully clad. :( 
03:56  John-Galt: Heh
03:56  John-Galt: I'm not a boat person.
03:56  thesnowdog: It was, stylistically, rather a tacky hodge podge of old and new.
03:57  thesnowdog: Yes, smiley I believe.

04:23  John-Galt: Mmm. Sierra Nevada Stout is rather good, too. Definitely more traditional than the Sam Adams, but still hoppier and more distinctive malt than crap like Guinness.
04:24  John-Galt: Hm. </pretentious-beer-snobbery>
04:25  John-Galt: Anyone have an opinion on http://dactyl.sf.net/bug/158 ?
04:27  stepnem: John-Galt: Well, didn't you say you were going to make mapping possible for Hint mode as a part of the modes refactoring? That would solve it -- anybody could do what they like.
04:27  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Not really, I don't use it that way... 
04:28 * thesnowdog is in selfish mode
04:28  John-Galt: Neither do I. My opinion is that hint mode shouldn't care about scrolling.
04:28  John-Galt: At any rate, I'd prefer not to do anything about it until I fix this horrible decreped mode hack rubbish.
04:29  John-Galt: (that sentence probably needed some commas, but, stout...)
04:29  John-Galt: stepnem: Yeah, probably.
04:29  stepnem: I don't see much point in scrolling while in Hint mode, either.
04:30  John-Galt: Well, the thing is that I made it possible to use hint mode with scrolling, so I'm ambivalent about key bindings.
04:30  stepnem: Well, key mapping should definitely work for all modes.
04:31  John-Galt: Yeah, there's no doubt about that.
04:31  stepnem: Which brings the scrolling issue with itself anyway... but I agree scrolling while hinting is pathological.
04:31  John-Galt: I think it's the g; hinting people who want such things.
04:32  stepnem: (as is any kind of autoscrolling IMO, but... there's no accounting for taste)
04:44  thesnowdog: ...so judgmental
05:03  zeltak: hya guys..wondering if you guys use thunderbird w the new mutt thing or use someting else?
05:03  stepnem: hm, insane -- the thing with j/k scrolling suddenly having stopped working just happened to me again
05:04  stepnem: zeltak: we use something else
05:04  zeltak: may i ask what?
05:04  stepnem: Don't let that stop you in maintaining Teledactyl ;-)
05:05  stepnem: I use Mutt and Gnus
05:05  zeltak: heheh i have zero coding knowledge unfortunantly other wise id be helping out with penta :)
05:05  zeltak: Gnus?
05:05  stepnem: an Emacs mail'n'news client
05:05  zeltak: ahh
05:06  zeltak: trying mutt in the last day or so but dunno cant get to open towards it after years of gmail
05:08  John-Galt: Gmail. Blech.
05:08  John-Galt: I could never stand Gmail. Especially in WYSIWYG mode.
05:08  Symm: I agree, I've always liked Thunderbird
05:08  Symm: before I knew about Tbird I used outlook, but tbird's so much better
05:10  John-Galt: Never used Outlook. Never liked it. I used Mozilla/Netscape Mail & News before Thunderbird, but haven't used any of them in years.
05:10  Symm: What do you use now?
05:10  John-Galt: mutt.
05:10  Symm: ah
05:10  Symm: I've thought of trying that
05:11  John-Galt: Well, I won't recommend it, but it's the most useable client for me at the moment.
05:11  zeltak: hheeh John-Galt you wont recommend it but your using it :)?
05:11  John-Galt: Sylpheed and Claws are alright if you want something lightweight and with a GUI, though.
05:11  John-Galt: zeltak: Well, it works for me, but it's far from perfect.
05:11  Symm: are both of those windows-compatible?
05:12  John-Galt: “All mail clients suck, mutt just sucks less”
05:12  John-Galt: Symm: Mutt, certainly not. Sylpheed/Claws, probably.
05:12  John-Galt: Althought mutt runs on cytwin.
05:12  zeltak: i thought you guys all used terdactyl 
05:12  John-Galt: *cygwin.
05:12  John-Galt: Nope. Why do you think muttator was always so poorly maintained?
05:13  zeltak: dunno im knew tovimperator/pentadactly 
05:14  stepnem: ...and typing, apparently :-P
05:14  John-Galt: Well, at any rate, muttator was Martin's project, which generally floundered due to him being, due to him "having a girlfirend" or something.
05:15  zeltak: heheh ok i get it :)
05:15  zeltak: i guess ill give mutt a shot..but yeah all email clients suck thats true
05:15  stepnem: Not only a girlfriend, but a job and all that; it's LIFE!
05:16  John-Galt: Yeah, well, I know devs with wives, full time jobs, and multiple children who still manage to devote time to their projects.
05:16  John-Galt: And, at any rate, it never seemed to cut into his time on IRC.
05:20 * John-Galt thinks that's perhaps a better excuse for working at Google than “free coffee”, at any rate.
05:21  stepnem: What is?
05:21  John-Galt: “20% time”
05:21  stepnem: Ah...
05:34  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I thought most companies just turned a blind eye to 50% time anyway...

09:52  thesnowdog: Where will they find the dinosaurs?
09:52  John-Galt: You watch *TV news*?!
09:53  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Apparently they'll use animatronic dinosaurs, but dinosaurs they will have.
09:53  John-Galt: They're batshit insane, that lot.
09:54  thesnowdog: John-Galt: I watch monumental amounts of TV in general. I especially like E...
09:54  thesnowdog: Americans are amusing.
09:55  John-Galt: Ugh.
09:56  thesnowdog: Oh look, it's Two and a half men...the night is young.
09:58  thesnowdog: Oh, I see they do mention dinosaurs. Of course they do.
10:01  John-Galt: Oh, my. If you can tolerate that show there's no hope for you.
10:04  thesnowdog: How would you know anything about it?
10:05  thesnowdog: I forgot, an american cornered me in the street yesterday to tell me he "knows what I've done, but Jesus will save me". Yep, yep, yep... Can't you keep 'em over there please?
10:08 * thesnowdog wonders why he always attracts the Christians, how evil can one person look
10:11  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Only if you keep yours over their. The guy who's building that park is from Australia.
10:12  thesnowdog: LOL
10:12  thesnowdog: Is he 'involved' or just an engineer?
10:13 * thesnowdog is somewhat ashamed to bust out the LOL
10:13 * thesnowdog learns that Noah only took juvenile dinosaurs on the ark to save space
10:13  John-Galt: He's the guy who runs the whole thing. Ken Ham
10:15  thesnowdog: Presumably he had to leave to find his kindred spirits.  My holy water mate is the braver man I think...
10:20  stepnem: you two should really run a TV show, I'm telling you
10:21  thesnowdog: Figures...he's a Queenslander. I tend not to consider them Australian. They're mostly fruit cakes but poor Ken must have been too much for even that lot. Poor chap.
10:22  thesnowdog: I'm up for it but John-Galt doesn't believe in TV.
10:22  stepnem: Although it's not bad as an IRC show either; I can't believe there're no scores of lurkers round here just to watch these discussions.
10:25  Utopiah: so I could catch the quickhint raised event in my greasemonkey script and stop the scrolling and thus have stable hint numbers
10:25 * thesnowdog wonders why Dale Bozzio doesn't sue the Gaga for...something.
10:26 * thesnowdog is rediscovering his New Wave years...
10:29  thesnowdog: Utopiah: Sounds like a lot of effort.  Does the GM script do the scrolling thang in the first place?
10:30  Utopiah: yes it does
10:31  Utopiah: and it already pauses when it encounter the mouse over a textarea
10:37  thesnowdog: Utopiah: Link? I'm trying to imagine in what context autoscrolling is useful but I probably just lack imagination.
10:37  Utopiah: well I use it on every page but wikis and videos
10:38  Utopiah: that's why it's important for me, it's pervasive
10:38  Utopiah: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/25207
10:38  thesnowdog: Thanks.
10:38 * thesnowdog -> Tv
10:39  John-Galt: Just weird. Weird.
10:40  John-Galt: Utopiah: No, you can't listen for it from a Greasemonkey script. It's only available to chrome code.
10:40  Utopiah: ah ok :/
10:48  John-Galt: Ugh. I've been meaning to go to sleep for hours and I almost started another book...
10:49  John-Galt: Oh no... I actually wrote "over their"... I really need sleep, then.
10:50  Utopiah: 1 last question 
10:50  Utopiah: in the doc there is on the left the key mapping and on the right the function name
10:50  Utopiah: but there is not javascript name like dactyl.sth()
10:50  Utopiah: where can I find those?
10:51  John-Galt: I don't understand what you mean at all.
10:51  stepnem: Utopiah: You have to search the source for where the key is defined.
10:52  stepnem: Dactyl is based on the Vim sucky model, so there is no one-to-one correspondence between keys and commands/functions.
10:52  stepnem: ...as in Emacs
10:52  Utopiah: ok, thanks
10:53  stepnem: the new :viusage! with links should help
10:54  stepnem: s/should/could/
11:00  John-Galt: That doesn't even make sense. There's never a one-to-one correspondence between key bindings and anything.
11:01  stepnem: In Emacs, keys are bound to commands. Commands are interactively callable functions.
11:02  stepnem: (same in Conkeror)
11:04  Utopiah: my point was that I want to rebind f to do sth then quickhint (thus what f normally does) again
11:05  Utopiah: sth like map f :js alert("f");<CR>|f
11:05  John-Galt: You can use :noremap for that.
11:05  stepnem: use noremap
11:11  thesnowdog: Utopiah: You can get at those 'anonymous' key 'command' functions if you want to with something like: mappings.get([modes.NORMAL], "j").action
11:14  John-Galt: Well, something more like modes.get(modes.NORMAL, "j").action
11:14  John-Galt: er, mappings.get
11:16  Utopiah: ah nice, thank you
11:32  thesnowdog: stepnem: I'm not so keen on the Vi commands 'model' either.

14:44  Guest249: ok, I upgraded to firefox 3.6 instead of 3.5, and it works now
15:29  thesnowdog: A friend's holiday snaps from his ride across America: http://tinyurl.com/28vqweq http://tinyurl.com/2dgoymt I really should do that soon these shots have me quite enthused.
15:31  thesnowdog: Hmmm, apparently he's already had his "Duel" moment too...
15:33  thesnowdog: This actually looks pretty tasty: http://tinyurl.com/2924qdj
15:33 * thesnowdog stops for a while...
16:18  thesnowdog: Hmm, crashes don't seem to ever offer me a "Restore Tabs" dialog anymore...
17:13  qwd: Hi, I just installed Pentadactyl. When I press t to open a new tag I get a list of keywords and typing doesn't show anything. What's up with that?
17:20  qwd: Same thing with w or if I press f I can't type anything, I can only input numbers to follow a link
17:41  Utopiah: hi qwd , you might wnat to follow the tutorial to get familiar to those commands started by keypresses
17:42  Utopiah: t url open a new tab with that url, w for a new window, f is the hit a hint mode to open links with the keyboard
17:43  Utopiah: so they might seem weird at first but once you get used to them you can't go back to FF default shortcuts
17:43  qwd: Utopiah: I've been using Vimperator for some time and I just read the quick introduction to see if there was anything different with Pentadactyls way of doing things. The problem is that after pressing t, w, or f I can't type any address, nothing appears. 
17:43  qwd: I just get the list of search keywords and can choose any by pressing tab, but that's it.
17:47  Utopiah: you can't do t test<CR>?
17:48  qwd: nope, I see ":test" but nothing appears when typing
17:48  sp3ctum: thesnowdog: nice sandwich :)
17:48  qwd: sorry, :tabopen :)
17:52  qwd: Aha! If I press t I get :tabopen and I can't type anything, but if I change window, for example by alt tabbing, and then go back to firefox I *can* type something there. I first need to switch AWAY from Firefox though
18:05  qwd: I think it may be related to the fact that as soon as I press for example t a list of stuff comes up, how can I make it so it only shows this when pressing tab? I did :set complete=b and now I don't get the list of search engines and keywords, just a list of my bookmarks.
18:12  Utopiah: I think :set complete=
18:12  qwd: I did :set autocomplete= to turn it off but that doesn't solve the problem that I need to switch to another window before being able to type something
18:12  qwd: same goes for :set complete=
18:22  qwd: apparently it's a bug https://groups.google.com/group/pentadactyl/browse_thread/thread/7c498282cde714ca :( guess I'll need to go back to vimperator and try pentadactyl when wheezy goes stable, in two years or so
19:15  John-Galt: Ugh. Debian users. qwd: It should work fine in the latest nightly.
19:44  qwd: John-Galt: ah, thanks, I thought it wouldn't be fixed after reading that Kris Maglione wrote "I've been meaning to raise minVersion to 3.6 anyway". I'll give the next Pentadactyl version a try.

23:22  John-Galt: And I hate those kinds of formatting strings, to be honest.
23:23  stepnem: Well, there's no other flexible way to do the same without some kind of interpolation, is there.
23:24  John-Galt: I think an 'elf' option would be sufficient for most circumstances.
23:24  stepnem: I.e. even with a separate option there would probably have to be some kind of formatting sequence.
23:25  stepnem: Hm, so columns are out of the question? ;-)
23:25  John-Galt: Possibly, but nothing like '%[+%L%] %f'
23:25  John-Galt: :(
23:26  John-Galt: I'll think about it.
23:26  stepnem: You must really enjoy Mutt if you like this kind of things ;-)
23:26  John-Galt: I hate mutt.
23:27  stepnem: I hate the humongous kind, too, but I really see nothing wrong with two/three simple formats for line and column (and filename).
