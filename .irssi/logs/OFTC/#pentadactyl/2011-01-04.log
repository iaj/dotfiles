17:06  John-Galt: I see...

17:12  thesnowdog: Am I seeing things or has my status bar just gone grey with black text...hmmm.
17:13  John-Galt: Possibly. Always or on some sites, and have you run with -purgecaches?
17:13  John-Galt: I'm fairly certain it's gray on some sites now, but, colorblind...

17:42  peetah_: booooouuuuuhhhh ! my status bar is now white on lightgrey whereas I set it to white on black in my colortheme (FF3.6)
17:42  peetah_: just to say that it's not very readable now :)
17:44  graffatcolmingov: -purgecaches
17:46  graffatcolmingov: if I put javascript in my pentarc and want to spread it over multiple lines, do I need \ for the newlines?
17:52  peetah_: graffatcolmingov: 'firefox -pentadactyl "-purgecaches"' or 'firefox -purgecaches', neither change anything
17:52  graffatcolmingov: peetah_: firefox -pentadactyl -purgecaches ?
17:53  peetah_: nope ! again this is for FF3.6
17:53  graffatcolmingov: I use both 3.6 and 4.0b8 and that works for me
17:54  graffatcolmingov: Then again I haven't pulled since the change he made for thesnowdog 
17:54  peetah_: i'll try with no plugins 
17:55  peetah_: much better
17:57  peetah_: spoke too fast
17:57  graffatcolmingov: What revision are you running?
17:57  peetah_: as soon as I load my colortheme, I have the white on whitegrey
17:57  peetah_: *lightgrey
17:57  graffatcolmingov: so your colorscheme is breaking something?
17:58  peetah_: tip
17:58  peetah_: well, it was not before the update
17:58  graffatcolmingov: your own colorscheme or one that I wrote?
17:59  peetah_: my own
18:00  graffatcolmingov: pastebin it?
18:01  peetah_: http://pastebin.com/HLNVWdrC
18:02  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: There's no -purgecaches on 3.x
18:02  Chousuke: hm, is the status bar now intentionally light grey? I liked it black :/
18:02  John-Galt: Chousuke: No, it's neither light gray nor intentionally so.
18:03  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: my mistake
18:03  Chousuke: hmm, well it's for me. it's not quite white, either.
18:03  John-Galt: Chousuke: Have you tried -purgecaches ? Or :rehash, which tends to have the same effect?
18:04  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: the issue is arising from either StatusLineSecure or StatusLineExtended
18:04  Chousuke: John-Galt: I did :rehash when I pulled latest hg and the colour changed to what it is now
18:05  John-Galt: peetah_: You need StatusLineNormal rather than StatusLine
18:06  Chousuke: oh duh, restarting firefox made it black
18:06  peetah_: John-Galt: thanks, that's much better
18:06  peetah_: so what is StatusLine for ?
18:07  John-Galt: The base stylings of the status bar. It's always applied.
18:07  Chousuke: the noscript button is still grey though. You said I could turn it black with CSS somehow but I have no idea how firefox's styling internally works so I don't know which selector I need. :/
18:07  John-Galt: Chousuke: Really? Should be fine now.
18:07  Chousuke: hm
18:07  Chousuke: I hope it's not something OS X specific
18:07  John-Galt: Not that I've tested it, mind you.
18:08  John-Galt: But the other add-on bar widgets are.
18:08  Chousuke: it seems it's still grey, even with -purgecaches
18:08  John-Galt: Gimme a minute to upgrade.
18:09 * John-Galt likes :extupdate ...
18:09  Chousuke: the ABP button is fine, so noscript must be doing something differently
18:09  John-Galt: Too bad NoScript isn't restartless.
18:09  John-Galt: Chousuke: ABP still uses the status bar, I think.
18:10  John-Galt: Chousuke: Ugh. The background is fine for me. It makes the status bar too ruddy big, though. New CSS is called for...
18:10  graffatcolmingov: ABP can use either the statusbar or the toolbar
18:10  graffatcolmingov: iirc
18:11  John-Galt: Chousuke: http://666kb.com/i/bptn0e6v9e3lkk987.png
18:11  Chousuke: hm :/
18:12  Chousuke: maybe noscript (or firefox) uses some other element for the button OS X 
18:12  Chousuke: +on
18:12  Chousuke: it looks like it has rounded corneres
18:12  Chousuke: -e
18:13  John-Galt: God, why the hell does the DOM inspector need that horrible drop-down for its box model tab? Why can't it just show you all of it at once?
18:13 * John-Galt considers diving into the XUL... to his chagrin.
18:14  John-Galt: Chousuke: Tried +u NONE ?
18:14  Chousuke: no difference
18:17  thesnowdog: Hmm, raunchy skits on the USS Enterprise? Never would have happened in Picard's day.  Well not outside the holodeck anyway...
18:19  John-Galt: Would have in Kirk's...
18:27  John-Galt: stepnem: WTH? I keep getting this from you: 12:18 [OFTC] CTCP ERRMSG reply from stepnem: ACTION is actually having ...
18:30  John-Galt: Ah, excellent, a DOM inspector with a bloody sane box model tab.
18:30  John-Galt: I s'pose I should submit a patch...
18:33  stepnem: John-Galt: Oh, sorry. I restarted my client and have had some amount of backlog sent to it automatically by ZNC...

18:58  Chousuke: hmm, that commit got rid of some padding but the colour remains :/
18:58  John-Galt: Well, like you said, it's a Mac issue. Poke it with the DOM inspector and fine out where the coloring's coming from and I'll fix it.
18:59  Chousuke: I have no idea how to use the DOM inspector. Am I supposed to find the element from amidst the hundreds?
19:00  Chousuke: it doesn't even have a search :(
19:02  Chousuke: ooh there's a select element by click thing
19:02  Chousuke: hmm
19:03  John-Galt: Yep. You can use :js inspectDOMElement(document.byid<Tab>("noscript<Tab> too
19:04  Chousuke: it says its class is "toolbarbutton-1 noscript-prt"
19:05  John-Galt: Yeah? And? I just want to know why it has a background color.
19:05  thesnowdog: Hmmm, just got a gray status bar again after a rehash - gone after a tab change. *shrug*
19:06  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Yeah, don't worry, that'll only happen once. Although I should have accounted for nullness... *fixes*

19:07  Chousuke: hmmhkhdkdfgjkgj how the hell am I supposed to find the proper stylesheet for that element
19:07 * Chousuke wants a search
19:08  John-Galt: Well, you can look at the computed style tab and keep looking at parent elements until you find one with an unsavory background color.
19:08  John-Galt: And when you do find it, look at the stylesheets tab to find out what's doing it.
19:10  Chousuke: ... and now dom inspector doesn't want to find me the damn element agains
19:10  Chousuke: -s
19:11  Chousuke: ah now it did. took three clicks, for some reason
19:11  Chousuke: hm, it has a background-image :(
19:11  Chousuke: -moz-linear-gradient
19:13  Chousuke: its parent is "toolbar" which doesn't have that style so I suppose I don't need to go any further
19:14  John-Galt: Oh, yeah, it does take multiple clicks because the button has some stupid mouseover handler rather than just waiting for you to click...
19:14 * John-Galt kicks Gorgio...
19:14  John-Galt: Chousuke: Really? Wtf... What class gives it that?
19:14  John-Galt: Can you post a screenshot?
19:14  Chousuke: some really long selector
19:14  John-Galt: (of the button and the inspector, preferably)
19:15  Chousuke: in chrome://browser/skin/browser.css
19:15  Chousuke: I suspect it's OS X specific
19:15  Chousuke: setting the property to none made it black but it still has a border
19:16  graffatcolmingov: Around the button you mean?
19:16  graffatcolmingov: s/button/icon
19:16  John-Galt: Chousuke: Screenshots would still help.
19:16  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: I think it may be the mysterious issue that was happening to me a few weeks ago
19:17  Chousuke: yeah now I made it work
19:18  Chousuke: just deleted all border styles and the background
19:18  Chousuke: hmm
19:19  Chousuke: the selector is:
19:19  Chousuke: .toolbarbutton-1:not([type="menu-button"]),
19:19  Chousuke: .toolbarbutton-1 > .toolbarbutton-menubutton-button,
19:19  Chousuke: .toolbarbutton-1 > .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker,
19:19  Chousuke: #restore-button 
19:19  graffatcolmingov: http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b16/___guitar/status_icons-1.png looks like that Chousuke ?
19:19  Chousuke: nope
19:19  Chousuke: lemme restart firefox so the style resets
19:20  John-Galt: Chousuke: Ok. I'll figure it out.
19:23  Chousuke: http://marisa.gensoukyou.net/ffx.png that's what the button looks like (in the bottom right). And what exactly do you need to see from the inspector?
19:23  John-Galt: Chousuke: The stylesheets tab with that style selected, please.
19:24  John-Galt: Oh, you've got a grippy... Weird.
19:25  John-Galt: Oh, you've got horizontal padding too. Wth.
19:25  Chousuke: there are a whole bunch of styles :/ doesn't really fit in a screenshot. 
19:26  John-Galt: Heh. You can resize the panel.
19:26  Chousuke: not enough :P
19:26  Chousuke: but I can go into the file and get you the CSS as text if that is what you need.
19:27  Chousuke: there's also another selector that has just a min-width: 28px in it
19:27  John-Galt: Yeah, that'd do it.
19:28  John-Galt: For the min-width one, too. That's a silly thing to have in the statusbar.
19:28  John-Galt: What's the space to the right of the ABP icon? That should go, too.
19:29  John-Galt: Oh... And that horrible text shadow.
19:30  Chousuke: hmm
19:31  Chousuke: the statusbar has padding it seems
19:31  Chousuke: 14 px of it.
19:31  John-Galt: Lame.
19:31  Chousuke: right padding, to be precise
19:32 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 9e2af4dd99160184af16d60a5d2bad52c94507c3 /common/modules/finder.jsm Fix finder bug.
19:33  Chousuke: what do you mean with text shadow? I'm not seeing it. Maybe I'm too used to shadows :P
19:33  John-Galt: Chousuke: You don't see the weird gray shadow below the status bar text?
19:34  John-Galt: It might be alright with a different font and background, but it just makes it look blurry there.
19:34  John-Galt: Chousuke: And can you get me that CSS? I'm having a hard time figuring out why the button should still be padded when I've already set it to 0.
19:35  Chousuke: http://marisa.gensoukyou.net/browser.css
19:35  John-Galt: Thanks.
19:35  Chousuke: John-Galt: I don't see any shadows. Maybe it's my antialiasing
19:36  John-Galt: Nope, it's a CSS text-shadow.
19:38  Chousuke: I can only find text-shadow: none :/
19:38  Chousuke: though it's not marked important
19:39  John-Galt: Chousuke: Better?
19:39 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 9e6a96b8f85c8c81cef67d44ab700c2d36aee219 /common/ (content/statusline.js modules/config.jsm) Hopefully fix some Add-on Bar button styling issues on OS-X.
19:39  John-Galt: Chousuke: I think it's probably inherited from the window, or something. That's what happens with certain Personas, apparently.
19:39  Chousuke: yeah looks good now
19:39  John-Galt: Chousuke: You should see a difference with something like :hi -a StatusLine text-shadow: none !important
19:40  John-Galt: Chousuke: Can you by chance post another screenshot?
19:41  Chousuke: I'm honestly not seeing a difference :/
19:42  John-Galt: Weird.
19:42  Chousuke: is the shadow so small I can't see it on my fullhd display or what?
19:43  John-Galt: It's possible, I suppose. Although it's quite obvious to me in the screenshot.
19:44  Chousuke: there's no difference after applying that highlight.
19:46  Chousuke: http://marisa.gensoukyou.net/default.png and http://marisa.gensoukyou.net/noshadow.png look identical to me.
19:47  Chousuke: if you're still seeing the shadow I think it's just OS X's font rendering
19:48  John-Galt: Yep, they are. But I'm fairly certain that that's not just font rendering. If it were it would be anti-aliased from white to black, but there's a distinctly gray tone to the fringes, and it's more pronounced towards the bottom.
19:48  John-Galt: Chousuke: Can you check the computed-style page of one of those elements in the DOM inspector and see if there's a text-shadow listed?
19:49  patrick85: I just updated Pentadactyl from the repo and getting this error message: http://pastebin.com/ZKTxqBsx
19:49  John-Galt: There might be some other font effect I'm not thinking of, though.
19:50  John-Galt: patrick85: Does Pentadactyl run?
19:50  Chousuke: oh there *is* a text shadow on it. I guess I was looking at the wrong thing at first.
19:50  patrick85: nope
19:50  John-Galt: Chousuke: I thought so... Wonder where it's coming from. Possibly the statusbarpanel...
19:51  Chousuke: hmm yeah statusbar has it
19:51  John-Galt: Crap. The OS-X nightlies come in DMGs...
19:51  Chousuke: it's a hfs filesystem, can't you mount them read-only?
19:52  John-Galt: Chousuke: Well, the :highlight should have blocked that. It's probably applied again to to a panel.
19:52  John-Galt: Chousuke: I can, but it takes some kind of magic. There's some user filesystem program that's required and I don't remember which.
19:53  patrick85: I can up a copy if you like
19:53  Chousuke: John-Galt: the statusbar selector has a text-shadow attribute in some file
19:54  John-Galt: Yeah, figured.
19:54  John-Galt: patrick85: Hm?
19:54  patrick85: OS X Nightly
19:54  patrick85: in zip/gzip
19:54  Chousuke: in global.css
19:55  Chousuke: John-Galt: can you fix it or do you need more info?
19:55  John-Galt: patrick85: Have you run with -purgecaches?
19:55  patrick85: yes
19:55  patrick85: twice
19:55  John-Galt: Weird. Might have to remove extensions.cache or something.
19:56  patrick85: this can be found where?
19:57  John-Galt: Crap. Fucking crap. My kernel got upgraded and now I don't have any loadable modules... ;(
19:57  John-Galt: patrick85: In your profile directory.
19:58 * John-Galt tries and fails to insmod one from his fancy new kernel version.
19:59  patrick85: I only have extensions.sqlite/log/rdf/ini but no .cache
20:04  patrick85: I deleted all extensions.* but still not working
20:05  graffatcolmingov: Anyone else having focus issues with 4b8?
20:15  patrick85: if I disable Pentadactyl and then enable it again it's working
20:15  patrick85: restarting Firefox though seems to break Pentadactyl again
20:16  patrick85: there's also this error: http://pastebin.com/GCq7xn9a
20:21  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Apparently.
20:22  John-Galt: patrick85: Oh, you're using an XPI? Could be fscked, I suppose.
20:22  patrick85: Yeah, I created an xpi from source
20:23  John-Galt: Oh. Weird. There's no 0103 nightly...
20:23  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: glad it isn't just me
20:23  patrick85: is there a way to fix that?
20:24  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: I've never seen it in b8. It's apparently not a problem in recent nightlies?
20:24  John-Galt: patrick85: Donno. Try a nightly. It works fine for me.
20:24  graffatcolmingov: Ok I'll try a nightly but it's not so frequent that I can't live with it
20:25  John-Galt: Maybe your awk is broken. Can you pastebin the contents of the chrome.manifest in your jar?
20:25  John-Galt: (you should be able to just open jar:file:///Users/patrick/Library/Application%20Support/Firefox/Profiles/ir8ndplt.default/extensions/pentadactyl@dactyl.googlecode.com.xpi!/chrome.manifest)
20:26  patrick85: http://pastebin.com/RwGu0vSE
20:27  patrick85: I just installed the latest nightly and there's still the same problem
20:27 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * b037bc0f8a5d67d559d1f3a6370d53f92beec6f5 /common/ (modules/config.jsm skin/dactyl.css) Hopefully fix text shadow in the status line on OS-X.
20:27  John-Galt: Weird. Should be fine. Try a new profile.
20:28  John-Galt: Also, what :version ?
20:28  Chousuke: John-Galt: The shadow looks like it's gone now.
20:28  John-Galt: Chousuke: Thanks.
20:29  patrick85: Pentadactyl hg5198 (created: 2011/01/04 00:00:14) running on:
20:29  patrick85: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b9pre) Gecko/20110104 Firefox/4.0b9pre
20:29  John-Galt: Yeah, you're going to have to try a new profile, then. It works fine for me.
20:30  Chousuke: John-Galt: hrm, there actually seems to be a hover style on the addon bar buttons too :( 
20:30  Chousuke: it doesn't look too bad though.
20:30  John-Galt: Yeah, I know. I only added the background override for :not(:hover)
20:32  patrick85: hm, it's working with a fresh profile…
20:33  John-Galt: Yep... not surprised.
20:59  stepnem: A pop quiz: Who is the author of the following utterance: "If people want hard to learn software so they can feel superior to non-geeks, then, but only then, the new vimperator might not be for them."?
21:13  graffatcolmingov: You stepnem ?
21:16  zeltak: is that a trick question :)?
21:18  thesnowdog: stepnem: I pulled an all-nighter and am incapable of understanding that sentence let alone attribute it...
21:19  thesnowdog: ...but I have my suspicions.
21:19  stepnem: Yes! thesnowdog wins!
21:22  Chousuke: hm
21:22  Chousuke: I wonder what has happened to my quickmarks
21:23  Chousuke: (not that I have very many of them)
21:23  thesnowdog: Hmmm, quickmarks - sound good in theory.
21:23  Chousuke: I like them
21:23  Chousuke: good for sites I frequent.
21:23  thesnowdog: Probably just me then, I never use them, not sure why.
21:24 * stepnem has never used any of marks vindyctyl provide{d,s}
21:24  stepnem: the
21:24  stepnem: kinds of
21:25  Chousuke: I don't use the page-specific marks either
21:25  thesnowdog: I use them all the time. :)
21:25  stepnem: But yeah, wiped out info directory, happened to us all...
21:25  Chousuke: it's happened to me twice within two days
21:25 * Chousuke suspects +u NONE 
21:26  stepnem: Unlikely.
21:26  stepnem: Hm... or not?
21:26  thesnowdog: I'm not sure I've ever had one of these corruped profiles etc that people so often talk of...
21:26  stepnem: Come to think of it.
21:26  thesnowdog: Either that or it's so cactus I don't notice anymore.
21:26  Chousuke: heh
21:29  thesnowdog: stepnem: That was some V 3.0 related comment I assume? What's happening with that?
21:29 * thesnowdog was going to follow it but well...
21:30  stepnem: thesnowdog: Well, the winners prize was supposed to be not having to read it in context...
21:30  thesnowdog: :)
21:31  graffatcolmingov: stepnem: anyone who ever used vimperator should have been able to pick up the context :P
21:34  patrick85: John-Galt: Thanks for your help, I migrated to a new profile and everything works now
21:35  thesnowdog: graffatcolmingov: I think he meant the prize was to be spared having to read the context. :)
21:36  graffatcolmingov: *facepalm*
22:48  John-Galt: thesnowdog: It took me three read-throughs to understand it.
22:49 * John-Galt never uses quickmarks either.
22:49 * thesnowdog learns that facebook is C++ generated by PHP? ...hmm, double hmm.
22:49  zeltak: i use them alot :)
22:49 * John-Galt uses page marks a lot...
22:49  zeltak: in fact id say its my #1 fav feature :)
22:49  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Huh? Those are two words that should never be used in their own sentences...
22:50  zeltak: LL
22:50  zeltak: that wsa my kid on the keyboard ^^
22:51  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Well so I'm told, I don't really want to investigate further.
22:51  zeltak: John-Galt:did u have a chance to check weather the bookmark bar issue is ff or penta?
22:51  John-Galt: Heh. Children should not be allowed near keyboards. My neices were so attracted to my glowing power button when I was at their house that I had to disable it.
22:51  John-Galt: zeltak: Nope. I'll get to it, though.
22:52  zeltak: heheh sounds like my son :)
22:52  zeltak: kk cool :)..but if i dont start letting my son fiddling with linux/penta/etc hell be drawn to the dark side of windows at shcool ;-0
22:53  thesnowdog: From FB: "The site is largely written in PHP though the engineering team developed a way to programmatically transform PHP source code into C++ to gain performance benefits."  Not quite what I was told.
22:53 * thesnowdog just visited FB o.O
22:54  John-Galt: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...
22:55  zeltak: btw graffatcolmingov your theme inspired me and im now in process of creating themes loosley based on it for penta+dmenu+mutt+vim+dzen2+subtle+ranger :)..a screen cast will follow once im finished..god and son willing during the weekend :)
23:31  graffatcolmingov: zeltak: which theme? :P oddity or simple
23:33  zeltak: graffatcolmingov: oddity..but its only loosley inspired by it :)
23:35  graffatcolmingov: No problem
23:41 * John-Galt is only an hour away from turkey soup... :)
23:41  John-Galt: But possibly too tired to enjoy it.
23:45  Chousuke: I'm getting a bit tired too. Accidentally typed "gut pull" and made myself laugh :P
