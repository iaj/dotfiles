01:29  iaj: John-Galt: may I ask - what guioptions do you use?
01:30  John-Galt: The defaults.
01:39  iaj: using tabeline?
01:39  John-Galt: Yes.
01:42  iaj: I just found out about that buftabs... that would make even more space in the main frame
01:42  graffatcolmingov: Does it even work?
01:43  iaj: For me it does.
01:43  iaj: just looks weird after startup ;)
01:43  John-Galt: Does it?
01:44  iaj: Yeah the bar looks strange when there's an empty window
01:44  John-Galt: I see...
01:45  iaj: For you, not?!
01:46  graffatcolmingov: ironically I tried it out today (the last version on the page) and it screwed up my StatusLine totally
01:46  graffatcolmingov: There were some missing parts from dactyl that must have been deleted or something
01:46  graffatcolmingov: It didn't work 100% right in the first place so I never used it really
01:48  John-Galt: iaj: Donno. I don't use it.
01:48  iaj: graffatcolmingov: ahw.. I see.. yeah you should have opened up a page I think
01:49  iaj: I just think the tabline looks way too gross
01:49  graffatcolmingov: iaj: I had pages opened
01:49  iaj: Really? Strange :(
01:50  graffatcolmingov: iaj I would generally agree but I've found kempelton to be a non-obtrusive theme which makes my tabs look nice enough
01:50  graffatcolmingov: iaj, yeah it's disappointing but it also blocks the current url which i like to know
01:50  John-Galt: I used to use MiniFox Flat along with my own styling in wmii.penta, but it started sucking with FF4.
01:51  iaj: what's kempelton? :-D 
01:51  John-Galt: A theme.
01:51  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: you use the default colorscheme for wmii?
01:51  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Of course.
01:51  iaj: graffatcolmingov: http://arvidaxelsson.se/kempelton/  that one?
01:51  graffatcolmingov: iaj Idk if it's out for ffx 4betas but it works for 3.6.12
01:52  graffatcolmingov: iaj possibly, i always get it through addons.mozilla
01:52  iaj: Waaahh Id never go back to 3.6 ;D 
01:52  John-Galt: Nor I.
01:52  graffatcolmingov: I never tried 4b so... I didn't have to worry about going back

01:53  graffatcolmingov: Also, given the unpopularity of my distro I'm not about to compile Any version of firefox from source.
01:54  iaj: graffatcolmingov: which distro is it?
01:55  graffatcolmingov: Slackware
01:57  John-Galt: Just grab a build. You don't even have to install them, just untar them and they tend to run.
01:57  John-Galt: Granted, they use their own versions of a bunch of libs you have on your system anyway, but...
01:59  graffatcolmingov: I might
02:00  graffatcolmingov: It'll be isolated from my 3.6.x profile yes?
02:02  John-Galt: If you want it to. There's the -P flag.
02:02  iaj: can I somehow simulate a mouseover effect only?
02:02  John-Galt: Hm?
02:02  graffatcolmingov: lol iaj that's one of the enhancements I suggested
02:03  graffatcolmingov: there's apparently a program for linux that will move your mouse via the commandline based upon the x,y coordinates you give it. I never bothered with it
02:04  John-Galt: There are dozens of them. One comes with wmii.
02:07  graffatcolmingov: which one is that John-Galt? (also the issue about stal=1 doesn't apply to 4b8 apparently)
02:07  John-Galt: I still haven't even figured out what you meant by that issue...
02:07  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: cmd/x11/wiwarp.c
02:08  John-Galt: Granted, it's dead simple: http://pastebin.com/zz9Gg6XN
02:09  graffatcolmingov: wrt that issue: in my pentadactylrc I have an autocmd set up which automattically opens a webpage in a new tab that. I have stal=1 set as well. When I start up firefox (3.6.12) stal=1 acts like stal=0
02:11  John-Galt: I'm pretty sure that doesn't make sense.
02:11  graffatcolmingov: Which is why it's an issue.
02:12  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: What's the :autocmd?
02:12  John-Galt: I mean, I'm not sure that's possible.
02:12  graffatcolmingov: autocmd Enter .* tabopen https://www.coglib.com/reader/tt-rss.php
02:13  John-Galt: Ok, *that* makes sense, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it's an autocmd.
02:15  graffatcolmingov: Is my autocmd wrong ?
02:16  John-Galt: No, but the tab opens at an inopportune time, I'd imagine.
02:16  John-Galt: For Firefox, mind, not us.
02:16  graffatcolmingov: I knew what you meant 
02:19  graffatcolmingov: It's bizarre but it doesn't seem to happen to 4b8
02:19  John-Galt: Hm. Come to think of it, for us, not for Firefox?
02:20  John-Galt: Not bizarre.
02:21  graffatcolmingov: Meh, I'll eliminate it, I can live without it I guess.
02:22  John-Galt: No, it's fixed, I just have to change branches to commit it, so I have to round off this changeset.
02:22  graffatcolmingov: Oh christ. Thanks.

03:00  iaj: John-Galt: are you editing all that files in vim?
03:00  iaj: I guess so :-D
03:03  John-Galt: Of course.
03:05  iaj: Do you use any plugins for doing so / being more efficiently?
03:06  John-Galt: Not really.

11:02  tlonim: John-Galt: now that i see it.. it may not be dactyl related.. http://blog.ndrix.com/2007/05/mutt-and-git-format-patch.html --> opening this freezes the browser 
11:02  tlonim: and no keybindings work either
11:03  tlonim: not related to hinting.. it is just the site which i opened with hint which then froze the browser
11:04  tlonim: John-Galt: and regarding revisions, i tested an old nightly like 20101221 .. still there 
11:05  John-Galt: That's not exactly old...
11:06  tlonim: hmm.. disabling greasemonkey is fixing it.. 
11:06  tlonim: let me check the scripts
11:07  John-Galt: You have Firebug enabled?
11:08  tlonim: yea.h.had..disabled it
11:08  tlonim: for debugging
11:08  tlonim: i thought may be that was the culprit
11:08  John-Galt: http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=3586
11:09  tlonim: this http://sprunge.us/fjPL -- is the only one enabled
11:09  tlonim: anything buggy about it ?
11:09  tlonim: and that happens only for a selected few sites
11:10  John-Galt: The script itself shouldn't matter. It's a Greasemonkey/Firebug bug.
11:11  tlonim: John-Galt: aha.. checked that issue..thanks
11:11  tlonim: but from Oct 28 ?
11:11  John-Galt: Yeah.
11:12  tlonim: i noticed it today..
11:12  tlonim: may be it triggers only for certain sites
11:12  John-Galt: It should trigger for any site with a user script.
11:13  tlonim: where are you applying this fix http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=3586#c25 
11:13  tlonim: to GM ?
11:14  John-Galt: Well, I use Scriptish.
11:14  John-Galt: But, no, to Firebug.
11:14  tlonim: i built from tip yesterday..may be they did some js changes which may have caused this 
11:14  tlonim: John-Galt: did they merge tracemonkey thing into tip ?
11:15  John-Galt: They do that all the time.
11:16  tlonim: John-Galt: nah.. you were earlier mentioning that merge and some incompatibilities right ?
11:17  John-Galt: When?
11:19  tlonim: "2010-12-23 10:31:09 John-Galt There's a change I've been meaning to make, anyway. The TraceMonkey people changed things so that properties on the content window last
11:19  tlonim:        | across page changes."
11:20  John-Galt: Yeah, but that's not a recent change.
11:21  tlonim: ah..because i built firefox after like 2 weeks..

11:57 * John-Galt likes this bootstrapped add-on business.
11:59  stepnem: John-Galt: So there were some improvements in that area? I remember seeing that blog post back in the day saying how ridiculously convoluted it was to transform a non-trivial add-on to a restartless one.

12:00  John-Galt: stepnem: Well, it's not as bad as he thought it was, apparently. Much less so if you don't need to use XUL overlays (which we don't, since I already needed to come up with a way to dynamically overlay windows).
12:00  John-Galt: And he was apparently completely wrong about not being able to add chrome packages dynamically. Which makes things *much* easier.
12:07  John-Galt: It does seem that the chrome.manifest is parsed anyway if you run directly from the extension dir...
12:08  John-Galt: Or possibly just in the case of Pentadactyl? Odd...
12:09  John-Galt: Ah, I see, the flag is only processed on install, not after restart... although bootstrap.js still runs.
12:23  iaj: is there something like the CTRL-F for editing the commandline in vi mode? :-)
12:23  iaj: morning and merry xmas every1 ;] btw
12:23  John-Galt: There's <C-i> for editing the command-line in Vim...
12:33  iaj: Hmmm... not working for me, but CTRL-F isn't either ... huh? :D
12:34  John-Galt: Does <C-i> work anywhere for you?
12:34  John-Galt: <C-f> isn't supposed to work.
12:41  iaj: John-Galt: in command mode, hitting c-f should bring the commandline buffer no?
12:41  John-Galt: No.
12:42  iaj: in : mode i mean ;)
12:42  John-Galt: I know, and the answer is: no.
12:42  iaj: in vim or in penta?
12:43  John-Galt: In Vim it should.
12:43  iaj: cos in vim you could do :he c_CTRL-f ..
12:43  iaj: ahhhhh
12:43  iaj: i thought you were talking about VIM :\
12:43  iaj: C-i is fine then :)
12:43  iaj: Thanks!
12:44  John-Galt: At some point c_<C-t> should probably be implemented, though.
12:46  iaj: Do you have set up any vim autocommands for *pentadactyl* stuff?
12:46  John-Galt: Huh?
12:47  iaj: in vim.. I mean... something like set filetype.. or on BufDelete.. to bring firefox to front again
12:48  John-Galt: Yuck. No.
12:48  iaj: :-D
13:43  tlonim: John-Galt: i am seeing a bug with keybinding
13:44  John-Galt: What bug?
13:44  tlonim: to reproduce, do something like :xave
13:44  tlonim: to give error
13:44  tlonim: then escape that prompt
13:44  tlonim: and after that key like <space> doesnt work
13:45  tlonim: i mean type any junk at prompt to give error, then escape it and then  few keybinds dont work
13:45  tlonim: to make it work i tried to switch tabs and back again
13:45  tlonim: after that it works
13:45  John-Galt: That's not a key binding issue, and at any rate, it's fixed.
13:46  tlonim: basically scroll keys fail i think
13:46  tlonim: John-Galt: fixed ? cool.. let me test.. when i ran firefox from commandline, i didnt give any error traces either
13:46  tlonim: let me test with latest hg 
13:48  tlonim: John-Galt: works now.. did you fix it sometime back ? because the one i pulled morning was the one failing

13:48  tlonim: aha.
