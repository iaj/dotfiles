00:12  John-Galt: It'd be nice if there were a version of mutt that weren't crap.
00:13  John-Galt: Or wasn't, even.
00:15  John-Galt: Someone should write one. Someone who isn't me.
00:39  rogutes: John-Galt: Any ideas how could half of libixp's .o files (in lib/libixp.a) end up being x86_64 and the other half i686 (host is x86_64, building in i686 chroot)? For example, http://dpaste.com/289614/plain
00:40  rogutes: I am pretty certain something is wrong with my config and wouldn't bother you, but both, libixp and wmii seem to be affected, whereas e.g. cdrtools is not
00:42  John-Galt: rogutes: No. Can you post your config.mk and the output of the build with noisycc=1 set?
00:50  rogutes: John-Galt: I didn't touch config.mk, so it is the same as tip@hg.suckless.org/libixp and the output looks ok: http://dpaste.com/289617/plain
00:51  rogutes: But file says that only srv_util.o and util.o in libixp.a are 32-bit - others are 64-bit
00:51  John-Galt: Weird. Did you make clean?
00:52  rogutes: Yes, just unpacked a new chroot, copied hg tip and ran this...
00:52  John-Galt: Strange. It works as expected for me...
00:58  John-Galt: This next commit is going to break for so many people, I think...
01:05  rogutes: Hm.. Just cloned a fresh copy of libixp and it built fine. I probably littered the local copy at some point in the past.
01:05  John-Galt: Oh, thank the gods that it didn't make it into the nightly...
01:05 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * d678604aa8d0bbe3f71c81cce99ac6ce5c542804 /common/ (6 files in 2 dirs) Allow mapping keys in HINT and other modes. Closes issue #10. Closes issue #158.
01:05  John-Galt: rogutes: Eh, happens. I'd blame GCC, myself.
01:08  rogutes: GCC is like magic (or rather a blacbox) to me - wouldn't know what to blame.
01:09  John-Galt: Black magic, yes.
01:09  rogutes: :)
01:36  anon33_: John-Galt: for some reason, on domains with passkeys enables - it then errors out where all keys are passed in some weird way. ':' no longer opens up the command line, etc.
01:38  John-Galt: anon33_: Yeah, apparently you need to quote the domain now, for some reason.
01:40  anon33_: could you give me an example of proper syntax? i currently have...
01:40  anon33_: set passkeys+='mail\.google\.com':c/jkhnl...<Tab><Return>
01:41  anon33_: with <Return> at the end of each of my passkeys lines
01:42  John-Galt: Hm. What :version ?
01:42  anon33_: the latest nightly
01:43  John-Galt: I'm not sure exactly what revision that is.
01:43  anon33_: here's my pentrc http://pastebin.com/bKvM4i44
01:43  John-Galt: Just need the :version ...
01:44  anon33_: sorry! 2010/12/22 hg4991
01:44  John-Galt: Thanks.
01:44  John-Galt: Yeah, that's yesterday's nightly.
01:45  anon33_: oh, was it just fixed?
01:45  John-Galt: At any rate, ask again when you've tried tomorrow's nightly. I just made massive changes to that code.
01:46  anon33_: hokay, i'm downloading the latest firefox beta so i'll do that simultaneously
01:46  anon33_: has it been committed? 
01:47  graffatcolmingov: Nightly will go up tonight around Midnight EDT
01:47  John-Galt: No, midnight UTC. Today's nightly is already out.
01:47  John-Galt: But it doesn't have the changes in question. Those come tomorrow.
01:47  anon33_: bummmmmerrrrrr
01:48  John-Galt: Well, feel free to grab it from the repo.
01:48  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: was it different a month or more ago?
01:49  anon33_: yeah, that's what i was wondering - if the changes had been committed so i could just checkout the code
01:49  graffatcolmingov: anon33_: yeah
01:50  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: No, it's always come out at midnight UTC.
01:51  graffatcolmingov: I must have been hallucinating months ago when I waited up for a nightly.
01:51  graffatcolmingov: That's when I caved and cloned the repo
01:51  John-Galt: Heh

01:54  remi: firefox 4.0b8 + pentadactyl straight from the hg repo is fast as hell
01:55  anon33_: i don't know if it's the fact that i reformatted my computer
01:55  anon33_: but everything is just freaking FAST
01:56  anon33_: are any of you guys using awesome WM by the way?
01:56  John-Galt: Anathema...
01:57  anon33_: what's that?
01:58  John-Galt: A word.
01:58  anon33_: alright.
02:10  anon33_:  is there a way to clone the repo using git?
02:10  John-Galt: Some people say there is.
02:11  anon33_: hey, the 12/23 nightly went up a little over an hour ago
02:12  anon33_: are the fixes you were talking about in the 12/24 nightly?
02:12  John-Galt: Yes.
02:12  anon33_: bummer..
02:23  anon33_: John-Galt: you aware on b8, scrolling to the top gives a horrifying visual bell?
02:24  John-Galt: It's always done.
02:24  anon33_: hmm...i still have set visualbell=false, but that doesn't change it
02:24  John-Galt: I think you mean :set novb
02:25  anon33_: there's some weird completion issues going on with the latest commit...
02:26  John-Galt: You really need to give me more than that.
02:34  anon33_: sorry! doing something like :set visualbell with autocompletion set does some weird modification to the generated completion, like changing it with each character typed

02:35  John-Galt: Interesting.
02:37  anon33_: i don't know how to quite explain it...
02:37  John-Galt: I can see it, you don't have to explain it.
02:38  John-Galt: :tabo doesn't work...

02:51  anon33_: there's also a bug, and i don't know if this had anything to do with the autocompletion issue, that makes hints dissapear after i hit the first number. for instance...
02:52  anon33_: i hit ';;' then '2', it doesn't autoselect the hint, and says undefined
02:53  anon33_: also - is :zo +25 supposed to zoom the text or all elements of the webpage?
02:54  John-Galt: 18:58 < John-Galt> This next commit is going to break for so many people, I think...
02:54  John-Galt: As for :zo, :help :zo
02:55  anon33_: ah, i misread something in there
02:55  anon33_: "ZI" was what i was looking for
02:56  anon33_: what will it break?
02:56  John-Galt: Any number of things. Hard to say, really, otherwise they wouldn't break.
02:57  anon33_: well, what's it fixing/implementing on the offset?

03:19 * John-Galt considers renaming StatusLineBroken to StatusLineB0rken
03:27  graffatcolmingov: lol
03:47  John-Galt: Bill Donohue is so funny. He's like a combination of walking coronary and Godwin's Law personified.
03:48  John-Galt: And he rants and raves when someone mentions that Hitler was a Catholic, and in good graces with the Pope, that he was an atheist...
03:48  John-Galt: He's good fun.
03:58  graffatcolmingov: Out of curiousity, how many people use their terminals in vi mode?
03:58  John-Galt: I do.
03:59  graffatcolmingov: I'm glad I'm not the only one. I've only recently converted my brother
04:05  iaj: I do as well.
04:05  iaj: May I ask what you guys are using for escaping?  Or rather what do you have mapped escape to?
04:06  graffatcolmingov: I use regular <Esc> ... Just what I've always been used to
04:07  graffatcolmingov: I always considered swapping CapsLock and Esc but I'm too used to where Esc is now
04:08 * John-Galt uses CapsLock
04:08  iaj: John-Galt: what about you?
04:08  iaj: dohage. :D
04:09  John-Galt: No, I mean, I use CapsLock as CapsLock
04:09  John-Galt: I use <Esc> and <C-[> as escape.
04:09  iaj: I had it bound to Capslock as well for some time .. . but I got CapsLock mapped to Control and doing CTRL-[, oh.. yeah.
04:09  iaj: Why do you use <esc> still? :)
04:10  John-Galt: Why not?
04:10  iaj: well... I'm just curious.. when you are using CTRL-[ that should be fairly easier to reach, no
04:11  iaj: s/$/?
04:11  John-Galt: No, <Esc> is fine.

04:15  John-Galt: It'd really be nice to have :bmarks -sort, except that we use that bloody bookmark cache for the results.
04:18  iaj: Are quickmarks bugged currently?  And is that history only viewable or browsable as well?
04:18  iaj: I tried gos but the g gets lost as soon as I hit o
04:21  John-Galt: Hm?

04:24  John-Galt: iaj: You'll probably want to disable autocomplete for history. In fact, I should make that the default. But I thought that bug was fixed...
04:25  iaj: Are quickmarks working for you?
04:25  iaj: John-Galt: i got set autocomplete=
04:25  iaj: in my rcfile
04:25  John-Galt: No, apparently arg mappings are broken.
04:26  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: cool feature for history
04:26  iaj: Ah... okay thanks!
04:28  John-Galt: Cheers.
04:28  John-Galt: Quickmarks...
04:28 * John-Galt never uses them.
04:28 * graffatcolmingov either
04:29  iaj: why not ? they are pretty handy :)
04:29  iaj: how do you navigate through often visited bookmarks?
04:29  John-Galt: :open is fine.
04:29  graffatcolmingov: I have a "home" page that has all my often visited pages
04:29  Symmetry: I use quickmarks rather than my bookmarks bar, which I previously considered indispensable
04:29  Symmetry: is that from an addon, graffatcolmingov
04:29  Symmetry: ?
04:29  John-Galt: I never used the bookmarks bar either. I've always hated it.
04:30  John-Galt: I've come across IE users with 6 toolbars who thought nothing of it...
04:30  Symmetry: I shrink all my toolbar bookmarks down to just a favicon, otherwise I'd have easily 6 row
04:30  Symmetry: s
04:31  Symmetry: but instead, I just use gn[X]
04:31  graffatcolmingov: Symmetry: it's an html file I keep in a git repo that I access via file:///$HOME/sandbox/homepg/index.html
04:31  Symmetry: or go[X]
04:31  Symmetry: graffatcolmingov: ah
04:31  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Why?
04:31  graffatcolmingov: Yeah. When I want to add/delete I just edit the html file.
04:32 * John-Galt just uses location completions...
04:32  Symmetry: also, update on that Requiem DVD-A rip: all but one of the (thirteen) files have been deleted from the server, so I cannot have them
04:32  Symmetry: I've asked the person to reupload, though
04:34  graffatcolmingov: With the exception of xmarks I know of no way to reliably sync bookmarks and I can keep the html file publicly accessible so I can access it from my friend's computers if need be
04:34  John-Galt: Heh... server? What is this, '99?
04:35  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Firefox has sync builtin.
04:35  graffatcolmingov: o_O? Since when?
04:36  Symmetry: Since 4.0
04:37  John-Galt: Since the early 4 betas, but it's an add-on for 3.x
04:38  graffatcolmingov: Didn't realize there was an add-on for 3.6.x.

05:50  Symmetry: I don't suppose anyone here knows if the bass channel on 5.1 FLAC has the same bandwidth as any other channel?
05:56  John-Galt: Yes.
05:56  John-Galt: Although it generally compresses better.
05:57  Symmetry: Any idea what the compression rate of DTS HD-MA is?
06:00  Symmetry: With 5.1 24/192 FLAC if that matters.
06:02  John-Galt: How can you have 24/192 FLAC?
06:02  John-Galt: At any rate, I think it usually averages about 58% compression, but better with more channels.
06:02  Symmetry: oh, forgive me, I misremembered, it's not ripped to FLAC, it's a straight ISO of blu-ray audio
06:31  anon33_: sorry this isn't too constructive John-Galt, but i downloaded from the latest commit and i'm still getting the same problem - although it doesn't seem to be passkeys domains specifically
06:36  anon33_: and the visualbell thing keeps getting reset for someodd reason
07:13  John-Galt: anon33_: Works for me.
07:13 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 1121d03f2c3aa8ce63cc9bd1c622f410d83d8c31 /common/content/options.js Fix minor regexpmap parsing bug.
07:14  anon33_: it's on and off..i'll see if i can replicate the behaviour
07:14  anon33_: but the visualbell thing definitely keeps getting reset
07:15  John-Galt: Don't think so.
07:15  anon33_: weird. hey - why might 'gg' stop working?
07:15  John-Galt: I don't think it would.
07:17  anon33_: it has =\ along with the stupid visual bell...
07:17  anon33_: no offense to the vb, its just annoying to see it come back on time and time again
07:17  John-Galt: Well, I suspect that your configuration has some hand in the matter.
07:18  anon33_: bummer, what do you think it might be? http://pastebin.com/bKvM4i44
07:18  anon33_: gg magically works again
07:20  John-Galt: Well, I'd guess the fact that you have 'set vb' in your config file...
07:22  anon33_: I have no idea how that got there.
07:30  Symmetry: I recall seeing a request somewhere for PD to add FoxSplit-like functionality. Was that ever addressed?
07:30  John-Galt: Not going to happen.
07:31  Symmetry: Alright
07:35  ecmuller: anyone awake?
07:36  John-Galt: Yes.
07:36  ecmuller: with version hg4991 on firefox 4.0b8 I can't get it to search google for unknown strings when opening tabs
07:37  ecmuller: I've checked google is the default search
07:37  ecmuller: also even typing 'google whatever'
07:37  John-Galt: http://dactyl.sf.net/pentadactyl/faq#faq-hidden-engines
07:38  ecmuller: hmmm...I'll take a look
07:40  Symmetry: Is it possible to use home row and number keys for hint mode?
07:40  Symmetry: I tried :se hintkeys=asdfjkl;0123456789
07:40  Symmetry: That only seems to use homerow
07:41  John-Galt: Works as expected for me.
07:42  ecmuller: John-Galt: that js string gives me a syntax error
07:42  ecmuller: the autocomplete is brilliant though
07:43  John-Galt: Can you paste it here? The JS string?
07:43  ecmuller: :js services.get(browserSearch).getEngines().forEach(function (e) e.hidden = false)
07:44  Symmetry: What's that supposed to do, out of curiousity?
07:45  ecmuller: unhide the search engines
07:45  Symmetry: What do you mean? how're they hidden currently?
07:45  ecmuller: they've always come up for me, I haven't noticed them hidden
07:46  John-Galt: ecmuller: You need quotes around the browserSearch bit.
07:46  John-Galt: I forgot, they're CSS generated by default, so they don't get copied.
07:46  ecmuller: I've got the quotes
07:46  ecmuller: they didn't paste
07:49  John-Galt: Well, in that case, there shouldn't be a syntax error.
07:50  John-Galt: Try this: js services.browserSearch.getEngines().forEach(function (engine) engine.hidden = false)
07:51  ecmuller: no syntax error, but it still says "the url is invalid and cannot be loaded"
07:51  ecmuller: if I use :open testing things
07:52  John-Galt: Do you have a search engine called google in :dia searchengines ?
07:52  ecmuller: yes
07:53  ecmuller: and the search engines show up when I initially type :open
07:53  John-Galt: Don't know what to say, then. :open google foo doesn't work either?
07:54  ecmuller: nope, same error
07:55  John-Galt: Well, then, there's something wrong with the search engine, or you've got a plugin doing something strange.
07:56  ecmuller: hmm
07:56  ecmuller: noscript maybe?
07:56  ecmuller: is there a domain I could add to the whitelist?
07:56  John-Galt: Not likely.
07:57  John-Galt: Hm... Hold on.
07:57  ecmuller: tabmixplus?
07:58  John-Galt: ecmuller: Are you sure you have an alias? Even after unhiding my search engines after they've just been wiped out, the aliases are gone.
07:59  ecmuller: if I type :open the list of search engines show up, if I start typing google it separates into two sections, the lone google search engine, and the previous searches I've done from the website
07:59  ecmuller: I assume that means the alias is there
08:00  ecmuller: the moment I hit space after typing 'google' though the search engine option vanishes
08:00  John-Galt: Yeah, but it's wrong. It generates the alias from the name since the actual alias is missing. But :open doesn't take that into account (which I'll fix)
08:00  ecmuller: I don't know if that's normal or not
08:01  ecmuller: is there a way to check the aliases somewhere?
08:01  John-Galt: Yes, :dia searchengines
08:01  ecmuller: oh....under the keyword column it's blank
08:02  John-Galt: Yep. Something's fscked in Firefox. I can't even add a keyword.
08:02  ecmuller: I can
08:02  ecmuller: oh sweet, that fixed it
08:03  ecmuller: thanks

08:08  John-Galt: The nice thing about automagically generated indexes is that now they cover plugins...
08:09  ecmuller: firefox plugins or pentadactyl plugins?
08:09  John-Galt: Pentadactyl. We don't deal with Firefox plugins.
08:10  ecmuller: I used vimperator for a long time, I can already see the differences between the two
08:10  ecmuller: it's pretty interesting
08:13  John-Galt: Well, that's nothing new, really. I made sure there were always significant differences between Vimperator releases.
08:17  ecmuller: anyway, thanks for the help, this extension really makes moving around the browser so much faster
08:17  ecmuller: goodnight
08:20 * John-Galt ← waspish prick, if that's not mixing metaphors...
08:34  Symmetry: Hey cool, fx just updated to b8 stable, b9 pre!

08:49  Symmetry: Hm, just updated to fx 4.0b8 and my addon bar is hidden after switching to the PD nightly.
08:50  Symmetry: Also, guioptions=n isn't showing up
08:51  John-Galt: Works for me.
08:51  Symmetry: Is there a command to reenable the addon bar manually?
08:52  John-Galt: Are you litterally setting guioptions=n ?
08:53  John-Galt: *literally
08:53  Symmetry: lbcnCM is my full string
08:53  John-Galt: You need an s in there.
08:54  Symmetry: Ah. That fixed it
08:54  Symmetry: The addon bar, anyway. tab numbers still aren't showing up
08:54  Symmetry: Oh, they're simply moved up and over the image, I couldn't see them at first
08:55  John-Galt: That shouldn't happen unless you have some strange highlighting. Or you use N instead of n.
08:55  Symmetry: I'm using Tree Style Tab - could that be the problem?
08:55  John-Galt: Yes, that's certainly the problem.
08:56  John-Galt: But tab numbers should have completely broken Tree Style Tab before a few days ago.
08:56  Symmetry: Damn. Well, N shows it on the far left, before the image - obviously not intended behavior, but it works
09:03  stepnem: Dammit, :style is still fucked. Has anybody else not noticed or what am I missing?
09:05  stepnem: It's obviously because I use -append, but the newer values totally replace the older ones.
09:06  John-Galt: stepnem: Yeah, I think I broke append. I realized it earlier when I was away.
09:07  John-Galt: It only works for styles that don't have a body.
09:07  John-Galt: (which is to say, I accidentally used the same function as for :highlight)

11:05  iaj: where can I obtain b8 stable?
11:05  iaj: morning btw:)
11:55  John-Galt: iaj: You might try asking your package manager for a copy.
12:33  stepnem: John-Galt: Given that we use Vim-style {mandatory} and [optional], I don't think so. 
12:34  John-Galt: stepnem: It clashes.
12:36  stepnem: hm... what about <? ?>
12:37  John-Galt: Ugh. No, it reminds me of PHP. I can't have people thinking we take after PHP of all things.
12:37  stepnem: Well, I don't even remember what exactly that means in PHP.
12:38  stepnem: You could just as well say we take it from XML; it would make about as little sense I guess.
12:38  stepnem: It's just the same characters.
13:07 --- josue is now known as j0su3
13:14  Symmetry: good lord
13:14  Symmetry: I've just spent the last three hours perfecting Rage Over A Lost Penny
13:14  Symmetry: and I think I have it perfect
13:15  Symmetry: but I hate that old bastard Beethoven right now
13:16  stepnem: I think you just need to get over yourself.
13:16  Symmetry: What?
16:03  tlonim: btw what is firefox necko component
17:32  John-Galt: tlonim: The networking library.
17:32  tlonim: John-Galt: is it core ?
17:32  tlonim: i mean essential ?
17:32  tlonim: i tried building without it 
17:32  tlonim: and it failed
17:33  John-Galt: Yes. It may be the most important component.
17:34  John-Galt: Facebook is so strange. I wind up with random Happy Birthday messages in my inbox from people I haven't spoken to in years.
17:35  tlonim: John-Galt: btw, what is ur mozconfig ? do u remove many default stuff ?
17:37  John-Galt: No, it's mostly defaults, except GnomeVFS, XPrint, and stripping are disabled.
17:39  tlonim: ah..
17:40 * John-Galt doesn't see the point of disabling things.
17:42  tlonim: if it makes stuff faster :)
17:43  John-Galt: No, it really doesn't. With the possible exception of safe browsing, which might be a slight problem on dialup while the database is downloading.
17:52 * John-Galt wonders if the restaurant is BYOB...
17:52  John-Galt: It'd be a good excuse to go to the beer store...
18:05  John-Galt: Oh, bugger, I have an addon-bar spring again.
18:07 +CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * 06cfdaf775d30d77b6561b23dd8283dc39f9a82a /common/content/mappings.js Add -modes argument to :unmap, :mapclear.
19:02  tlonim: btw is hlsearch removed ?
19:02  stepnem: tlonim: renamed to hlfind
19:03  tlonim: cool
19:03 * John-Galt points at NEWS...
19:04 * stepnem grabs popcorn and waits for the passkeys "sane syntax" proposals
19:04  John-Galt: Heh :)
19:19  tlonim: yeah..should have checked NEWS
19:29  tlonim: hmm getting
19:29  tlonim: chrome://dactyl/content/buffer.js: 386: TypeError: field.ownerDocument.defaultView
19:30  tlonim: is null
19:30  tlonim: or gi
19:30  tlonim: for*
19:30  John-Galt: Need a stack trace.
19:30  tlonim: hold on
19:30  John-Galt: Nevermind. I'll take care of it.
19:30  tlonim: http://sprunge.us/RLON
19:31  John-Galt: There's a change I've been meaning to make, anyway. The TraceMonkey people changed things so that properties on the content window last across page changes.
19:31  tlonim: wait..that paste is another issue
19:32  tlonim: or same
19:33  tlonim: some custom keys are not working too i think.. let me check

20:33  John-Galt: I just found out that JetPack add-ons all include *all* of JetPack. Even the parts that they don't use. Even the parts that every other JetPack add-on uses.
20:35  stepnem: Look, they brought the "I don't see the point of disabling things" philosophy to a new level. :-P
20:36  John-Galt: I'm reviewing an add-on that has 7700 lines of JetPack boilerplate for 37 lines of actual code.
20:36  John-Galt: Which, as it happens, coule be implimented with less than 10 lines of XUL overlay and a chrome.manifest
20:37  John-Galt: *could *implemented
20:51 * John-Galt suspects that Pentadactyl could probably be made restartless.
20:53  John-Galt: Fairly easily.
20:54 * John-Galt wonders whether Pentadactyl should be made restartless.
20:56  stepnem: Now the startup is fast enough that I don't particularly care, but I guess it's always better restartless than not, aliis paribus.
20:57  John-Galt: True. At any rate, it'd be a nice excuse to get rid of that damned overlay file.
20:58  John-Galt: Especially now that I have code in place for pure JS overlays.
20:58  John-Galt: And it'd be a good excuse to splice the DTDs into the help files so I could auto-generate them.
20:59  stepnem: Auto-generation FTW.

22:42 * John-Galt wonders what's the point of going out to eat if he can't have good beer...
22:49  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: why are you always reviewing firefox add-ons? Is that part of what you have to do as a developer?
