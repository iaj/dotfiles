10:38  procto: guess nightly it is...
10:47  tlonim: i am getting "chrome://dactyl/content/hints.js: 424: TypeError: invalid XML namespace dactyl" now
10:47  tlonim: hm

13:01  thesnowdog: tlonim: That is fixed - see #201.  You really should run tip. ;-)
13:03  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You'll pleased to know that the stalker has now been identified as a long lost friend with Paranoid Schizophrenia so I have to call the psych services if he turns up again rather than beat him to death.
13:03 * thesnowdog puts cricket bat back in closet
13:08  thesnowdog: John-Galt: You sure that FN interview wasn't a skit? o.O
13:43  tlonim: thesnowdog: ok..yeah..i do.. this was on  a different PC where i run nightly
14:07  thesnowdog: tlonim: Well while John-Galt does sometimes break things he tends to close the bug reports before most of us see them too. So it's always worth checking tip first.  Though it looks like the report and commit failed to shake hands in this case so it was easy to miss.
14:09  tlonim: ok
14:10  thesnowdog: tlonim: I only mention it because by lurking in here you declare yourself a hardcore cutting edge user who is on top of everything.
14:11 * thesnowdog can't keep up either...just quietly
14:12  tlonim: 'hardcore' yeah :)
14:12  tlonim: watching "The Most Hated Family in America" now
14:12  tlonim: it is lol
14:13  thesnowdog: Is that that the bunch of "God hates army fags" 'christians'?
14:13  tlonim: yes
14:13  thesnowdog: Yes, they are a bit special.
14:13  tlonim: i am not surprised but they sound too extreme
14:13  tlonim: a bit too extreme
14:14  thesnowdog: Even Fox News condems them. :)
14:14  tlonim: yeah
14:14  tlonim: that was the surprising part
14:14  thesnowdog: ...mostly for critizing the military though.
14:15  thesnowdog: *criticising - it's getting worse by the day
14:16  tlonim: thesnowdog: so it seems 4th test will have highest attendance 
14:16  thesnowdog: Yes, it's usually a big turnout in Melbourne anyway. The "Boxing Day Test" is a bit of an 'institution'.
14:17  thesnowdog: The Poms are accusing us of doctoring the pitch now. o.O
14:17  tlonim: yeah..Boxing Day
14:18  thesnowdog: How quickly they've lost their nerve and fallen back to a defeatest mentality.  Poor darlings.
14:18  tlonim: they tend to choke
14:18  tlonim: even SA chokes many a time 
14:20  thesnowdog: Though now Warnie has self-destructed again and thrown away Ms Hurley there spirits may be buoyed knowing he won't be coming back.
14:22  thesnowdog: Parkey suggested he needed to seek professional help tonight on the news, it was mildly amusing, given he's being interviewed by Warnie tomorrow.

16:50  John-Galt: thesnowdog: No skit, that's classic Fox News to a T.
16:51 * John-Galt like the Phelps family.
16:51  John-Galt: I think they probably do more for the cause of gay rights than anyone else in the country.
16:53  John-Galt: Wow, there's a log of op* words in that line...

18:16  stepnem: Heh. I did something similar (but much simpler) the other day when hacking up a dactylrc mode for Emacs...
18:17  John-Galt: Simpler?
18:18 * John-Galt is all for :mkelsyntax...
18:18  stepnem: Well, it can't get much simpler, true... I just defined a dactyl command that saves the relevant data to a file; then use that file from Elisp.
18:21  stepnem: (There is no such thing as syntax files in Emacs. The syntax highlighting is purely regexp-based and always put together with other mode-specific functionality.)
18:23 * John-Galt is well aware of that.
18:23  stepnem: mode â‰… filetype
18:39  CIA-9: Doug Kearns <dougkearns@gmail.com> * 9482263404d24e03a0b1d34245d9d8182f247ce2 /common/content/io.js Add missing syn-contained args to the :mksyntax generated file.
18:40  thesnowdog: John-Galt: Thanks for that.
18:41  thesnowdog: ...now my last pretence of contribution is dead.
18:58  John-Galt: Heh. Sorry. You can still iron out the kinks, since I don't know what they are.
18:58  John-Galt: Wow, what a crappy day...
19:00  thesnowdog: Weather, or your dog died?
19:02  John-Galt: Nope, just crappy. Possibly because I haven't eaten... or had coffee... and was up too late and possibly drank too much...
19:03 * John-Galt goes and tries not to feel suicidal for a while.
19:03  stepnem: 8-D
19:14  thesnowdog: Suicide is for sissies all the cool kids are ceasing to exist these days.
19:29  thesnowdog: John-Galt: What's the purpose of Option#realNames
19:31  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Ugh. Because we splice "no" onto the beginning of boolean option names and I didn't feel like coming up with a proper solution.
19:33  thesnowdog: Aha.
19:48  rogutes: A new one for me: 'Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMViewCSS.getComputedStyle]' (not reproducable).
19:50  John-Galt: rogutes: :yank String(util.errors) ?
19:51  rogutes: Or perhaps it is reproducable (pentadactyl keys do not work after (P)asting this): http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.11/Zend_Db/Adapter/Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Sqlite.html#methoddescribeTable
19:53  rogutes: Yes, I can reproduce it without any rc files: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6QR1iB1d
19:55  John-Galt: Hm. I hate native Exceptions. You don't get proper stack traces...
19:55  John-Galt: Ah, that does it. Thanks.
19:57  John-Galt: PHP... yuch.
19:58  John-Galt: Oh, interesting, a comment node has the caret. That almost never happens.
20:00  rogutes: The carret ends up here: <a name="methoddescribeTable" id="describeTable"><!-- --></a> ?
20:01  John-Galt: Yeah, apparently, but it shouldn't actually wind up in the comment element.
20:01  rogutes: FF bug?
20:02  John-Galt: Possibly, but we should of course handle it anyway.
20:02 * rogutes thought he will get sent upstream...
20:03  thesnowdog: rogutes: Follow the salmon
20:03  John-Galt: :)
20:06  rogutes: thesnowdog's remark has reminded me of a certain 'Salmon of Doubt' I was going to read 6 years ago...
20:10  thesnowdog: rogutes: A bit controversial if you ask me.  I'm not a fan of posthumous releases.  Especially of unfinished material.  It doesn't seem fair to mess with a legacy.
20:10  thesnowdog: ...then again he's not going to care I suppose.
20:13  thesnowdog: Hmmm, that's the third weird bug that the PHP api docs have exposed.  Not suprising...
20:14  rogutes: :)
20:14  John-Galt: Ah, I keep meaning to read it, but reading an unfinished hodgepodge that he never decided whether should be a Dirk Gentley or Hitchhiker story just seems a bit wrong.
20:14  rogutes: thesnowdog: no wonder, the pages they generate look kind of pre-war
20:15  John-Galt: Well, it's PHP, what do you expect?
20:15  rogutes: My PHP can translate thru tens of natural languages!
20:15  CIA-9: Kris Maglione <maglione.k@gmail.com> * abc4b68ecbc790f831c8806a5aa790248ba88a7e /common/ (content/buffer.js content/io.js modules/util.jsm) Deal with some Buffer.findScrollable corner cases.
20:16  John-Galt: Big deal, I know dozens of people who can do that.
20:18  rogutes: Exactly.
20:19  rogutes: And thanks for the fix.
20:23  rogutes: John-Galt: I think that the traces I posted regarding finding problems didn't contain this before: "Node cannot be used in a document other than the one in which it was created" (http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cdcdeKZT), did they? Does the first part of this one say anything useful: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cdcdeKZT ?

20:41 * John-Galt doesn't understand what people see on Colombian coffee.
20:54  John-Galt: Oh, Julie Benz is in Dexter? I just may have to watch it after all...
20:56  graffatcolmingov: I may have to agree
21:15 * thesnowdog thought she was most known for being in Dexter *shrug*
21:16  John-Galt: Well, you thought wrong. She's most known for being in Buffy and Angel.
21:16  thesnowdog: Perhaps to you.  For someone who doesn't like "TV" you sure seem to watch a lot.
21:17  graffatcolmingov: thesnowdog: quite frankly, TV sucks. There are few shows that don't suck. They could probably be counted on one hand if need be.
21:18  thesnowdog: I don't think Buffy and Angel are two of those 5 if you narrow it down to that.
21:18  John-Galt: I watch certain shows, but I certainly don't watch them on TV. Most shows aren't worth watching, though, and the ones that are usually get cancelled.
21:18  thesnowdog: 6 episodes of Buffy?
21:18  graffatcolmingov: Yeah I'm with John-Galt. I watch most TV series on DVD after the fact
21:18  thesnowdog: Of course, because if you watched them on TV they would somehow worse.
21:18  John-Galt: I'm pretty sure she was in more than 6 episodes, but she was an important character. More so in Angel.
21:19  thesnowdog: 20 of Angel apparently.
21:19  John-Galt: thesnowdog: They would. They would have commercials, for one thing.
21:19  John-Galt: Plus, TV screens are crap.
21:19  graffatcolmingov: lol
21:19  John-Galt: Even HD screens are crap compared to computer monitors.
21:20  graffatcolmingov: My computer monitor could be a small TV :3
21:20  thesnowdog: Weirdos
21:21 * graffatcolmingov shrugs
21:21  graffatcolmingov: Partially how I was raised. Also I refuse to pay for cable
21:21  John-Galt: Eh, mine's only 16", but that's fine with me. I'll take 720p at 96 dpi over 720p at 20-30dpi any day.
21:21  thesnowdog: Though I must confess to saving more and more series to the drive from cable for later viewing
21:22 * John-Galt refuses to pay for cable, too.
21:22  John-Galt: Too many channels with too little content, and on a schedule that's arbitrary and not mine.
21:22  John-Galt: Plus damned near $70/month if you want digital and something like $50 for standard. Utter bollocks.
21:23  thesnowdog: How do you acquire all these DVDs?
21:23  John-Galt: I don't acquire DVDs. I download my shows.
21:23  thesnowdog: It costs me about $200/month for internet that makes downloading remotely feasible.
21:23  thesnowdog: How much do they cost?
21:24  John-Galt: Although, buying series DVDs is a lot cheaper than paying for cable.
21:24  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Cost? I don't pay for them...
21:24  thesnowdog: Why not?
21:24  John-Galt: Because that would be moral and stuff.
21:24  thesnowdog: OK, so it's not exactly comparing like with like then is it?
21:25  John-Galt: Anyway, I could just get Hulu+ for all that and pay $10/month for as much TV as I wanted.
21:25  graffatcolmingov: Or you can abuse the public library system like I do
21:25  thesnowdog: It's probably something to do with how you were conditioned as graffatcolmingov said I guess.  I haven't seen a screen improvement that has had any impact on my viewing pleasure in 15 years.
21:25  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Like I said, I could buy series DVDs for all the shows that I care about for a lot less than $70/month. Or use Netflix, for that matter.
21:26  thesnowdog: I think they're about $25 a series here and I probably watch a lot more than you but I agree cable is a bit or a rort as is internet here especially.
21:26  graffatcolmingov: And if you're amoral like John-Galt (and me) you can copy DVDs with some ease so your schedule isn't constrained by the library
21:26  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: I've never had a public library with a collection of TV DVDs. They tend to stick to movies, and even then have a mix of classics, really bad pop releases, and other random horrible choices of the librarians.
21:27  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: I guess being up in the NE provides me with better librarians
21:27  graffatcolmingov: Plus there's a network of libraries in my county that I can "order" from
21:27  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Oh... They're more than that here. Usually at least $40/season, but some of them are as low as $25, for less popular shows.
21:27  John-Galt: And iTunes charges abou $1/episode, I believe.
21:27  thesnowdog: Well, as you've said, you obviously don't watch many. :)
21:28  graffatcolmingov: It then gets shipped to my local library and I pick it up. Admittedly ordering TV shows is a pain because some libraries put them together as one item and others split the DVD's however.
21:28  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Don't be absurd. I lived in Jersey and Pennsylvania for 23 years.
21:28  graffatcolmingov: I'm in Northern Jersey currently
21:28  John-Galt: Possibly more...
21:28  thesnowdog: UK crime drama + Showtime/HBO series alone would probably cover my cable bill if I were to actually buy them.
21:29  thesnowdog: To be honest I can't keep up with what I have saved anymore anyway.
21:29  thesnowdog: Perhaps I should just get with the kids.
21:29  graffatcolmingov: I also launder music from my libraries.
21:29  thesnowdog: graffatcolmingov: You are a disgrace.
21:29  graffatcolmingov: It's there and it's legal
21:29  John-Galt: Heh. I just use Bittorrent. A gift from the gods, that service.
21:29  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Not leagal to copy, just to listen to.
21:29  John-Galt: *legal
21:30  graffatcolmingov: I've got shit internet so downloading is not an option
21:30  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: when did I say I was copying? ;)
21:30  thesnowdog: What's 250GB/month cost there?
21:30  John-Galt: Well, you said 'launder', which I couldn't ascribe any meaning to, so I figured you probably meant copy.
21:31  John-Galt: thesnowdog: We don't have bandwidth limits.
21:31  graffatcolmingov: Something outrageous likely. I've got 1MB/sec down at any one second for something like $17 (w/o taxes)
21:31  John-Galt: Well, band*width* limits, yes, but no monthly data transfer limits.
21:32  thesnowdog: When did the "west" become so fuckign soft?  Apparently being stranded for a couple of days in London is equivalent to a few years in Bergin-Belsen for most folks. Pathetic...
21:33  thesnowdog: 1MB/s? You see that or they advertise it at that?
21:33  John-Galt: O.o
21:33  graffatcolmingov: thesnowdog: both
21:33  John-Galt: I supposedly have 40Mbps. But it never clocks above 16 on speed tests.
21:33  graffatcolmingov: Well I realistically see 900KB/s and change
21:33  thesnowdog: ...and that's "crap" you say?
21:34  graffatcolmingov: thesnowdog: not for normal purposes but when I download either of the 2 podcasts I listen to, my internet becomes shit.
21:34  John-Galt: QoS is your friend.
21:34  graffatcolmingov: Going to play a flash game? Don't expect to do much else on the internet in that time. Youtube vid? Nothing else for you.
21:34  graffatcolmingov: QoS?
21:35  John-Galt: It used to be mine until my ISP stuck me with this grubby ass modem/router combo that has state tables that fill up and leak buckets besides.
21:35  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: Google?
21:35  graffatcolmingov: Ah
21:36 * thesnowdog gets 16Kbps in Jindabyne and about 2Mbps in Sydney - that latter feels like lightning

21:50  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Yes, because we all know how accurate Wikipedia is on matters of opinion.
21:50 * John-Galt wonders what the chances are of catching the beer store girl on her cigarette break...
21:51 * thesnowdog wonders why John-Galt's sarcasm and irony radar is often so far off - or is it mine.
21:52  thesnowdog: ...more stalking.
21:52  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Have you ever considered that I'm probably self-consciously ironic?
21:53  thesnowdog: Clearly with the last part of my comment...or so I thought.
21:53  John-Galt: No stalking. Stalking would make it easy. I'd just wait around for her. Which is creepy, and dull besides, and therefore not something I'd do
21:54 * thesnowdog was curious what "catching" meant exactly
21:55  John-Galt: Heh. Australians... *shakes head*
21:55  thesnowdog: :)
21:55  graffatcolmingov: And here I thought John-Galt was going to stand on the roof with a fishing rod and tie cigarette's to the hook to catch her
21:55  John-Galt: :D
21:58  thesnowdog: John-Galt: This is turning into a saga almost as long as a friends "should I or shouldn't I ask the hot woman on the yellow Fireblade who parks next to me every day out" - that lasted about 18months before she stopped coming.
21:58  thesnowdog: ...I'd explain but who has the time.
21:58  graffatcolmingov: lol
22:02  John-Galt: thesnowdog: Heh. I wouldn't call it a saga. I only go to the store every two weeks or so. Anyway, it'd be easy if she weren't a clerk. I can't talk to people behind counters, and I can't ask people out who I don't know.
22:02  John-Galt: Waitresses are easier, and bumming a cigarette is really the best way to go...
22:03  thesnowdog: C'mon...
22:04  graffatcolmingov: I'm actually with John-Galt on this one thesnowdog. I only asked this one barista out from Starbucks (which I only started going to regularly because of her) after a month of stupid chit chat at the counter
22:06  thesnowdog: "barista Starbucks" - made me wake up the neighbours - funny on many levels. :)
22:07  thesnowdog: ...just as long as she wasn't your "girlfriend" during the chit chat phase. ;-)
22:08 * John-Galt wonders if such people really exist...
22:08  John-Galt: It reminds me of the Raisins episode of South Park...
22:10  graffatcolmingov: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/why-everyone-hates-new-net-neutrality-ruleseven-nn-supporters.ars
22:13  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: btw, what could be causing that odd behavior with the status icons on my colorscheme?
22:17  John-Galt: graffatcolmingov: You're probably clobbering the StatusLine style.
22:21  graffatcolmingov: Apparently adding a -a to the line makes it work...
22:21  John-Galt: True, but you should be using StatusLineNormal (and yes, you should try to keep to -a)
22:21  John-Galt: Awesome: http://www.onlyintheory.com/CT_LunarEclipse2010_1080p.jpg
22:22  graffatcolmingov: StatusLineNormal as opposed to? StatusLine? or Normal?
22:23  John-Galt: StatusLine
22:23  John-Galt: It's in :help ...
22:24  graffatcolmingov: Ok. Hadn't noticed there was a switch. I'll fix them both (oddity and the other one) up.
22:37  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: the other issue is Ghostery on the x86_64 machine. It screws up the StatusLine with the "box" around it. I'm not certain why but it's likely they don't care and I don't know how many other paranoids are out there using pentadactyl and ghostery simultaenously.
22:37  graffatcolmingov: I haven't tested the updated colorscheme on the i686 machine but disabling Ghostery makes the issue go away.
22:38  John-Galt: Hm? Screenshot?

22:43  graffatcolmingov: Also this is the fresh profile.
22:44  graffatcolmingov: The only thing I have on the i686 which I don't have on here is Tor Button but Ghostery acts bizarre with Vimperator/Pentadactyl anyway and only did so on the i686 machine for the longest
22:44  graffatcolmingov: *acted
23:00  zeltak: John-Galt: hya how are you? i just saw ff4 in arch updated to b8..is it safe or will penta go all mental again on me :)?
23:00  rogutes: zeltak: afraid to try?
23:01  zeltak: heheh well last time penta went all crazy and im addicted to oenta by now so im not taking the risk :-)
23:01  rogutes: zeltak: don't you know how to downgrade?
23:02  John-Galt: zeltak: b8 will probably work better than b7.

23:08  zeltak: notice half the bar is grey now
23:08  John-Galt: You want to limit the MOW height?

23:09  rogutes: zeltak: style -name killuicrap chrome://* #addon-bar toolbarspring { display:none; }
23:10  John-Galt: rogutes: We do that already.
23:10  John-Galt: Well, not the spring, because it's gone.
23:10  zeltak: rogutes: yeah issuing that command fixes it
23:10  John-Galt: At least, I don't have it in b9pre...
23:10  rogutes: John-Galt: yeah, they probably messed smth. up in b8
23:10  John-Galt: Hm... Have to do that by default, then.
23:11  zeltak: so should i go ff nightly or stick the above command in pentarc?
23:11  John-Galt: Just stick the command in your rc. Nightlies are generally a bad idea.
23:11  rogutes: zeltak: as far as i tested, a nightly won't be better
23:11  graffatcolmingov: John-Galt: thanks, I was hoping it could be done via CSS (use it on CmdOutput option in colorscheme)
23:11  zeltak: mmm so whats the solution ?
23:12  graffatcolmingov: 17:10.18  John-Galt:~$ Just stick the command in your rc. Nightlies are 
23:12  John-Galt: Erm, you don't want to use it on CmdOutput, I don't think. I'd do it to the MOW container.
23:13  zeltak: ok ill stick it in the rc then
23:13  rogutes: John-Galt: http://dpaste.com/289164
23:13 * rogutes wonders what one could do with a google.com cookie...
23:14  John-Galt: rogutes: Are you still getting that in tip?
23:14  rogutes: John-Galt: yes
23:14  John-Galt: Oh.
23:14  John-Galt: Interesting.
23:24  rogutes: John-Galt: I can't really see thru this finder.js :/ Is there a way to access the current RangeFinder object?
23:24  John-Galt: :echo finder.rangeFind
23:25  John-Galt: You should have seen the old finder.js, then. :)
23:25  rogutes: Was the old one yours?
23:25  John-Galt: Nope.
23:26  rogutes: Haven't got the energy now, but it could be interesting to compare some other time :)
23:29  John-Galt: Wasn't actually too bad, for the most part, except that it was broken. And it didn't have a RangeFind class, because it used the builtin (horrible) TypeAheadFind and a bunch of code from the findbar binding instead.
23:30  John-Galt: hg cat -r 1606 content/find.js <-- Before my time apparently.
23:30  John-Galt: And, later, less broken, more ugly, and still before RangeFind: hg cat -r 2427 liberator/content/find.js
23:32 * rogutes never knows where to put todo notes like this
23:32  John-Galt: Heh. Someone (zeltak?) was talking about such a program the other day...
23:35  thesnowdog: Some people like todo.sh
23:35  rogutes: thesnowdog: yeah, but I need a crond first...
23:35  rogutes: :)
23:35  John-Galt: Eh, I just use flat text.
23:35  thesnowdog: Err, todo.txt
23:35  John-Galt: rogutes: You don't have a crond?
23:36  rogutes: it went... away
23:36  thesnowdog: http://ginatrapani.github.com/todo.txt-cli/
23:36  John-Galt: Weird.
23:37  thesnowdog: Hmm, rememberthemilk is still around...
23:37  John-Galt: Eh, I just use echo, or occasionally ed. And "full blown text editor" sessions are cheap. I open and close terminals and Vim like I breathe.
23:37  thesnowdog: Oh, the pain of "launching a full blown text editor"
23:37  thesnowdog: Sorry, didn't read your comment first. :)
23:38  John-Galt: Heh. :)
23:39  rogutes: This "full blown text editor" launches even faster than `wmiir ls /tag|sed 's#/##; /^sel$/d'|wimenu|sed 's/^/view /'|wmiir write /ctl`...
23:40  rogutes: So todo.txt would be well enough... but I keep ending up without a crond installed for a year now...
23:40  John-Galt: I'm not sure I could uninstall crond if I tried...
23:41  John-Galt: Well, I could, but I suspect that my package manager would try to stop me.
23:41  John-Galt: I just hate to be pushed around by some fucking machine. --Ken Thompson
23:42  rogutes: John-Galt: nothing depends on crond and you said you were using Arch, and pacman has got no list of 'essential' packages...
23:43  John-Galt: It has a core set. But it is required: Required By    : backintime  logrotate
23:44  John-Galt: Hm. I've never used 'backintime'
23:44  rogutes: :D
23:46  John-Galt: Ugh. I'm having to review an add-on that provides horoscopes.
23:47  John-Galt: I wonder if I can refuse on non-religious grounds?
23:47  John-Galt: Oh, god, and it matches you agains your partner...
23:48  rogutes: Did something happen to gF? It opens an empty vim window.
23:49  John-Galt: What do you have for 'editor'?
23:49  rogutes: John-Galt: the default
23:49  rogutes: John-Galt: editor='gvim -f +<line> <file>'
23:49  John-Galt: Should work, then.
23:49  John-Galt: Doesn't, but should.
23:50  rogutes: Yeah, like finder.
23:50  John-Galt: And I know why...
23:50  John-Galt: Because I made it async, so the temp file gets removed before the editor can read it.
23:50  rogutes: :)
