13:50 --- Query: Starting query with DarkDefender on OFTC
13:50 iaj: lo
13:50 iaj: thare ;)
13:50 DarkDefender: lo
13:50 iaj: could i maybe try out your theme
13:51 iaj: the basic highlight of hints is just --- :(
13:51 DarkDefender: umm ok. But if you don'r have the font I use you'll have to clean it up. That's why I'm asking for a set command to do it instead :P
13:52 iaj: oh.. heh.. what font is it?
13:52 DarkDefender: Gohufont
13:52 iaj: btw is there a way to fasten up the ways hints are generated
13:52 iaj: heh, nice
13:52 iaj: just googled it.
13:53 DarkDefender: http://font.gohu.eu/
13:53 DarkDefender: ah ok
13:53 iaj: :-)
13:54 DarkDefender: http://pastebin.com/Av9QYfXE
13:54 DarkDefender: there you have the theme.
13:55 iaj: thanks man :)
13:55 iaj: sec
13:56 DarkDefender: it's a port from the vimperator theme. I just made some modifications so it works with dactyl
13:56 iaj: hmmm i see.. the font on the command line is too narrow tho:)
13:57 DarkDefender: It's still missing some of the more obscure theme options. Mostly the ones that error dialogs use.
13:57 iaj: hmm which font is specified for the commandline?
13:58 iaj: like the rhs / lh?
13:58 iaj: lhs?
13:58 DarkDefender: well everything is working there. I set the monospace font for firefox instead so I don't have to hack datycl more to change fonts.
13:59 iaj: which font and what to did you change?
13:59 DarkDefender: so the font options there is prob obsolete.
13:59 DarkDefender: rhs?
14:00 iaj: what font in firefox did you change :)
14:00 DarkDefender: :pref -> content -> advanced -> Western -> change monospace font
14:01 DarkDefender: this will change the font on webpages also FYI
14:01 iaj: ohh. ok :)
14:01 iaj: nah thats not waht i want
14:01 iaj: heh
14:03 DarkDefender: So you don't want to change the font for the whole gui or...
14:03 DarkDefender: ?

14:08 iaj: nahh not the whole gui
14:08 iaj: just for the command line there
14:08 iaj: well I need to get to the toilet at first
14:08 iaj: heh
14:08 iaj: brb
14:10 DarkDefender: well the cmdline is ":hi Cmdline ..."
14:10 DarkDefender: so just look at the theme file and you'll understand
14:12 iaj: hi CmdLine				font-family: gohufont !importamt; padding: 1px !important;
14:12 iaj: theres a mistake
14:12 iaj: with !importamt
14:12 iaj: isn't it :D
14:14 DarkDefender: gah ><
14:14 DarkDefender: spelling mistakes
14:15 iaj: in the completion menu.... i need to fix that as well
14:15 iaj: heh
14:17 iaj: oh you know how I could trunchate the string of an url at several chars?
14:19 DarkDefender: no, I'm no a dev. But if perhaps we should report it to the bugtracker. The text shouldn't overlap with the desc for urls :P
14:20 iaj: hehehe
14:20 iaj: ok :)
14:23 iaj: btw which ff are you using?
14:23 DarkDefender: 4.0b8pre
14:24 iaj: can you tell which tab you are currently viewing?
14:24 DarkDefender: yes, I use buftabs to do that.
14:24 DarkDefender: I've disabled the tabline so I need that to see :)
14:25 DarkDefender: http://code.google.com/p/dactyl/issues/detail?id=13
14:25 DarkDefender: if you want to use int
14:25 DarkDefender: just remember to use the latest one.
14:25 DarkDefender: :P
14:28 DarkDefender: then you can just use the number on the tab to go to it with "<number>gt"
14:30 DarkDefender: or if you use the new tabgroups you can bind a key to "<C-v><C-e>" and you can use it without the tabline
14:31 DarkDefender: and B to see all your tabs and <number>b to change to a "buffer" :)
14:37 iaj: hmm the last thing I don't get
14:37 iaj: the new tabgroups?
14:37 iaj: can you gimme a screenshot
14:38 iaj: of your firefox maybe?
14:38 DarkDefender: you can create groups by opening the tabgroup window with ctrl-v ctrl-e
14:38 iaj: hmm i don't have tabgroup enabled it seems:(
14:38 DarkDefender: you'll need firefox 4
14:38 iaj: ahhh
14:38 iaj: ⌘-E here
14:38 iaj: :-)
14:39 DarkDefender: ah mac :P
14:39 DarkDefender: didn't know they have different key bindings
14:39 iaj: hehe they do 
14:40 DarkDefender: anyways... Just drag a tab out of the "main" group to create an other group
14:40 iaj: drag - that means mouse
14:40 iaj: gnaaaaaaa
14:41 iaj: what exaclty is B doing?
14:41 DarkDefender: once you set the groups up all tabs opened in that group will stay there
14:41 iaj: oh simply listing the tabs?
14:41 DarkDefender: you can also give the groups names
14:41 DarkDefender: yes
14:41 DarkDefender: or buffers
14:42 DarkDefender: it has to do with how vim handels tabs/buffers
14:42 DarkDefender: everything you open in vim is "open" in buffers. Even if you don't see them
14:43 iaj: what's the advantage of buftabs
14:43 iaj: btw.. :)
14:43 iaj: just taking a look at them
14:43 iaj: yeah im using vim as well
14:43 DarkDefender: you don't need to have the firefox tabline
14:43 DarkDefender: so it will be like in vim :)
14:44 iaj: oh.. but how do I know which is curenlty selected
14:44 iaj: they all look similar to me
14:44 iaj: heh
14:44 DarkDefender: highlight BufTab font-weight: normal;
14:45 DarkDefender: *:
14:45 iaj: how do your guioptions look like
14:45 iaj: *: ?
14:46 iaj: ooh ok... its working... :)
14:46 DarkDefender: forgot ":" on highlight if you wanted to use it when running firefox
14:47 DarkDefender: set guioptions=scCM 
14:47 iaj: ahhh im adding it directly to the theme anyhow :D
14:48 DarkDefender: naw that one should be in your rc file
14:48 iaj: mhhh strange I still got my tabline
14:48 iaj: after having guioptions set like that
14:48 DarkDefender: yeah that's an other option
14:48 DarkDefender: set showtabline=0
14:49 DarkDefender: and if you want to see links in the commandline
14:49 DarkDefender: set showstatuslinks=command
14:49 iaj: ahhh yeahhhhhhhh
14:49 iaj: nice !
14:50 DarkDefender: :)
14:51 iaj: do you have your rc somewhere?
14:51 DarkDefender: no, but i can pastebin it
14:51 DarkDefender: it's now that big
14:53 DarkDefender: http://pastebin.com/yPNXy6MN
14:54 DarkDefender: you'll have to change some binding to the mac shortcuts if you want to use them
14:56 iaj: hehe
14:56 iaj: thanks ill take a look soon
14:56 iaj: but where did you place the...
14:56 iaj: hi BufTab				font-weight: normal;
14:56 DarkDefender: in the rc file
14:56 iaj: i tried inc olorscheme and it only gets sourced when I :colorscheme zenburn
14:57 iaj: and then at the bottom of my rc file
14:57 iaj: but i still need to do colorscheme zenburn
14:57 iaj: manually until it gets loaded
14:57 iaj: pretty strange :/
14:57 DarkDefender: you need "loadplugins" at the start for the rc file
14:58 DarkDefender: otherwise it doesn't load the plugins so that you can change the options for them
14:58 iaj: ahhww.. omg... where do you get your knowledge from
14:59 DarkDefender: I copy pasted a config file when I where using vimperator. I was well documented... XD
14:59 DarkDefender: *IT
14:59 iaj: heheh I see
14:59 iaj: thanks man :)
14:59 DarkDefender: np :)

15:05 iaj: i don't get that grouping of tabs yet
15:05 iaj: but alright heh
15:05 iaj: :)
15:06 DarkDefender: well it's mostly used so that you can "stuff away" tabs that you are no currently working with
15:07 iaj: when I put :he guioptions I don't see anything
15:07 DarkDefender: but as you said, it would be nice to have commands to create new groups etc
15:07 iaj: how do I group tabs?
15:07 DarkDefender: ?
15:07 iaj: well when I run it
15:07 iaj: there are 5 tabs... but nothing grouped so far
15:08 iaj: oh and I don't see any scrollbars at all anymore
15:08 DarkDefender: yeah that's the guioptions thing
15:08 DarkDefender: I don't use them so...
15:09 DarkDefender: you can write "set guioptions=" and it will show what options you have
15:09 DarkDefender: if you want to add them back or change some other thing
15:11 DarkDefender: anyhow. You create new groups by draging a tab outside the main group
15:11 DarkDefender: drag an otherone to that tab and the group will expand
15:11 DarkDefender: you can also name the groups
15:11 iaj: ahhh ok :)
15:12 iaj: im gonna try
15:12 iaj: one sec
15:13 iaj: Oh that's actually pretty nice
15:13 iaj: but not yet supported in dactyl to switch groups etc
15:13 iaj: correct?
15:13 DarkDefender: it is
15:13 iaj: how?
15:14 DarkDefender: just press shift+b and you'll see all buffer and what group they are in
15:14 iaj: but how do I switch to a certain group?
15:14 DarkDefender: then :b<number> or <number>b to change to that tab
15:14 iaj: oh how can I switch the font of the buffers that's coming on top when I press B
15:14 iaj: oh.. alright
15:14 DarkDefender: you change to that group that the tab is in when you change to it
15:15 DarkDefender: well I gave up with the font thing. That´s why I use the one in the prefs dialog :P
15:15 iaj: ok.. but I can't go according to the groups name yet
15:16 iaj: can I quickly search for something and if its a link.. go to it?
15:16 iaj: i tried /foo
15:16 iaj: but i can't <CR> then
15:16 iaj: :(
15:17 DarkDefender: f then write what you want
15:17 DarkDefender: it will try to match
15:19 DarkDefender: so f f will select all links with f in them
15:19 DarkDefender: and f fo all link with fo in them and so on
15:21 iaj: ahhh im using hintkeys
15:21 iaj: heh
15:21 iaj: :-)
15:21 iaj: that's odd then :\
15:21 iaj: f<space>part of it
15:21 iaj: space jkl
15:21 iaj: works :)
15:22 DarkDefender: naw no space is required
15:23 DarkDefender: i just did that to make clear that f was the keybinding
15:23 iaj: hehe.. yeah but I use the following
15:23 iaj: set hintkeys="fdjkasleior"
15:23 iaj: so those will follow hints
15:23 iaj: if I hit them after a
15:23 iaj: f
15:24 DarkDefender: oh, I see
15:25 iaj: :-)
15:25 iaj: but I set mapleader to space
15:25 iaj: and can toggle with space now
15:26 DarkDefender: I didn't know you chould do that :P
15:26 iaj: hah
15:26 iaj: at least you learned something from me now :)
15:26 DarkDefender: ^^
15:29 iaj: :p

15:45 DarkDefender: yeah, it's 15:45 over here :p
15:45 iaj: hehe
15:45 iaj: :-)
15:45 iaj: what did I want to ask .. damn
15:45 iaj: haha
15:47 iaj: using any other plugins for dactyl?
15:47 iaj: ahhh
15:47 iaj: when you edit the buftabs.js
15:47 iaj: is it getting syntax highlighted correctly by vim?
15:47 iaj: bcause for me it isn't :(
15:48 DarkDefender: well besides buftabs I only use the noscript plugin
15:48 iaj: hmm k :)
15:48 iaj: how do you toggle scripts?
15:48 DarkDefender: yeah it seems to highlight correctly for me in vim
15:48 iaj: really?
15:48 iaj: damn why doesn't it for me :(
15:49 iaj: neither in vim nor in macvim
15:49 DarkDefender: most of that stuff in automagicly setup in gentoo for me
15:50 DarkDefender: you have "syntax on" right?
15:52 DarkDefender: and filetype on
15:52 DarkDefender: but i think those should be on by default
15:53 iaj: yeaah... all other files are shown correctly
15:53 iaj: but that one is off
15:53 iaj: :\
