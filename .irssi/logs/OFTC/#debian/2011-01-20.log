20:09  iaj_: lo there im just installing debian on a virtual server which I mainly want to use for irssing.. but mb as well for hosting a website.. shall I chose Debian 5.0 - LAMP   or Debian 5.0 LAMP 64 bit
20:10  iaj_: Anyone able to lend me a hand - is it wise to chose 64 bit ?
20:11  bartm: iaj_, sure why not 64 bit
20:12  catsup: unless you think you might want to run some non-debian 32bit binaries, use 64bit
20:12  catsup: s/think you might/know you will/
20:13  bartm: and even then it's still possible to run 32 bit binaries in a chroot
20:15  iaj_: im mainly gonna run irssi,vim,screen
20:15  iaj_: that's about it :D
20:15  qwd: iaj_: doesn't matter. just pick one that makes you feel good.
20:15  iaj_: 64bit then:D
20:15  iaj_: sounds more futuristic.

20:25  iaj_: where do I have to enable ssh access for a newly created user?
20:25  bartm: iaj_, is sshd installed? then the newly created user should have access by default, I think
20:26  iaj_: i can root login.. but not with my new user
20:26  iaj_: did adduser user.. 
20:29  bartm: anything useful in /var/log/auth.log ?

20:33  lapfrog: lol nice nick
20:34  bartm: look, iaj_ is still moving a bit
20:34  lapfrog: yes, it's called digestion
20:34  bartm: lol
20:34  lapfrog: and it involves movement
20:37  iaj_: ãƒ„
20:37  retrospectacus: ghosts!
20:37 * retrospectacus runs away to #debian-offtopic
20:39  iaj_: haaha, im a tough one..   i'm used to gentoo mainly - is there an easy way to install irssi 0.8.13+ instead of the basic 0.8.12?s
20:39  bartm: iaj_, there's version 0.8.15-1~bpo50+1 at backports, if you're using lenny
20:40  retrospectacus: ,versions irssi
20:40  judd: Package irssi on i386 -- etch: 0.8.10-3; etch-backports: 0.8.12-7~bpo40+1; lenny: 0.8.12-7; lenny-backports: 0.8.15-1~bpo50+1; sid: 0.8.15-2; squeeze: 0.8.15-2

20:42  Xsodia: #backtrack-linux
20:42  adb: !backtrack
20:42  dpkg: BackTrack is not Debian and is not supported in #debian (ask me about <based on debian>).  Try http://www.backtrack-linux.org/ or #backtrack-linux on irc.freenode.net instead.  BackTrack is a Linux distribution based on <Ubuntu> Intrepid (as of BackTrack 4), previously <SLAX>.  Derived from merging two penetration-testing distributions: WHAX (formerly WHOPPIX) and Auditor Security Linux.

21:38  raph_ael: hi
21:40  raph_ael: i have some issues with network manager on sid with awesome wm, at boot, it works fine, but if there is an upgrade or if i need to restart networkmanager, it disconnects all the time
21:40  amphi: FWIW. wicd seems to work rather better, it seems
21:41  MeglaW: wicd <3
21:42  raph_ael: here's my paste http://paste.lisp.org/display/118854
21:42  raph_ael: amphi: maybe i should try yes
21:42  amphi: raph_ael: wicd has an attractive curses client too ;)
21:44  raph_ael: amphi: that's a very good point in fact :)
21:44  plon: There is a problem with the x-server:
21:44  plon: ...:~# Kwrite / etc / apt / sources.list
21:44  plon: kwrite: cannot connect to X server
21:44  plon: In addition, inhibits the environment. Once due to a double error KDE has blocked some (can not remember what (((() application X and everything was ok.
21:44  plon: Sorry for bad English
21:44 <-- debhelper has kicked plon from #debian (use http://paste.debian.net or /msg dpkg paste)
21:44  amphi: raph_ael: it is indeed
21:45  amphi: raph_ael: the gui thing has 'tray' support, I believe - I have no tray myself
21:45  raph_ael: amphi: thanks for helping, i'm installing it
21:46  raph_ael: i'm bored with windows like error message
21:47  amphi: "a device attached to the system is not functioning" - that sort of thing, you mean? ;)
