18:21 iaj: hi there

18:36 iaj: can you drop me a message once your back?
18:37 Chousuke: I'm here but I have to go to the shop soon
18:39 iaj: Oh can you maybe share two things with me.. your look-n-feel setting for hints, and where can I obtain charhints?
18:39 Chousuke: :help hintkeys
18:40 iaj: what's your 'hintkeys' setting?
18:40 Chousuke: and for hints I have: 
18:40 Chousuke: highlight Hint text-transform: uppercase; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: white !important; background-color: red !important; border-color: ButtonShadow; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; padding: 0px 1px 0px 1px;
18:40 Chousuke: highlight HintElem color: black; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5);
18:40 Chousuke: highlight HintActive color: black; background-color: rgba(136, 255, 0, 0.5);
18:40 Chousuke: in my RC file
18:40 Chousuke: highlight Hint text-transform: uppercase; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: white !important; background-color: red !important; border-color: ButtonShadow; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; padding: 0px 1px 0px 1px;
18:41 Chousuke: highlight HintElem color: black; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5);
18:41 Chousuke: oops
18:41 Chousuke: anyway, my hintkeys setting is "fdjkasleior"
18:41 Chousuke: you might want to add more keys, but I do fine with those
18:42 iaj: thanks a lot man - Im gonna check that out :)
18:42 Chousuke: (the default is set to a bunch of numbers so you get number hints)
18:42 iaj: the hint setting is FAR better than the default one
18:43 iaj: do you use the basic j,k to navigate up and down?
18:44 Chousuke: yeah
18:44 Chousuke: though I've mapped them so that it's 4 times faster
18:44 Chousuke: ie. :noremap j 4j
18:44 iaj: i tried with map only and it didn't work out :D
18:44 iaj: heh
18:44 Chousuke: and ditto for k
18:44 iaj: stupid me
18:46 iaj: can I remove that flashy blinking, when I reach top/end of a document?
18:46 iaj: (and hit j,k again?!)
18:46 iaj: :-)
18:47 iaj: sorry for bugging you
18:47 Chousuke: yeah it's the bell
18:48 Chousuke: ":js dactyl.beep = function () {}" in your RC file will take care of it
18:48 Chousuke: or you can make your own plugin to do it, like I do
18:48 iaj: woa... crazy... you don't happen to have your rc file shared somewhere do you?
18:48 Chousuke: (I think it's better than using the rc file)
18:48 Chousuke: I have nothing special in the rc file
18:49 iaj: oh.. so you have your own plugin?
18:49 Chousuke: well, a "plugin"
18:49 Chousuke: it
18:50 Chousuke: it's just a couple bits of javascript that dactyl loads automatically
18:50 Chousuke: because it's in the plugins folder
18:50 Chousuke: http://pastebin.com/ArS2GgKG like this (I dunno why the copyright notice is still there :D)
18:51 Chousuke: the other tweak prevents the last tab from being removed by d/D
18:51 Chousuke: (so that the window is not closed)
18:54 iaj: yeay.. thakns a lot for sharing:))
18:55 iaj: i can simply open a js file in the plugins folder put that stuff into it and its gonna work out right?
18:55 Chousuke: yep.
18:56 Chousuke: and any other javascript you want to run when dactyl starts up
18:56 Chousuke: it's a better place for javascript tweaks than the rc file IMO
18:56 iaj: cool!! do you make use of some other plugins
18:56 iaj: yeah
18:56 Chousuke: since the rc file can be overwritten
18:56 iaj: your right about that probably
18:56 Chousuke: I use noscript.js
18:56 Chousuke: for noscript integration
18:57 Chousuke: you can get it from the dactyl plugins page
18:58 iaj: ahhh thanks:)
18:59 iaj: So I only need to get stella to work with dactyl and I'm all set ;)
18:59 iaj: and maybe asdfhjkl  but I tried that one already :)
18:59 Chousuke: stella?
19:00 iaj: yeh the one that lets one control youtube
19:01 Chousuke: ah
19:02 iaj: seems like they changed the option system on dactyl

19:47 iaj: heh. you still round?
19:47 Chousuke: I just came back from the shop
19:48 iaj: what's your 'go' like?
19:48 iaj: :-)
19:48 Chousuke: bCrs
19:48 Chousuke: actually
19:48 Chousuke: I think I should remove s
19:49 Chousuke: oops
19:49 Chousuke: I mean r
19:49 iaj: ahh I missed s 
19:49 iaj: and I wondered why I never saw how much I was through the document :)
19:52 iaj: much better with +s :)

20:43 iaj: since your using dactyl - i guess you are using vim as well - correct :-)?
20:45 Chousuke: nope
20:46 iaj: really?
20:46 iaj: that's strange :)
20:46 iaj: heh

21:24 iaj: Btw.. do you know a lot about javascript?
21:25 Chousuke: nah
21:25 Chousuke: just bits and pieces
21:25 iaj: where did you get your knowledge from?
21:29 Chousuke: guessing :P
21:29 Chousuke: and reading vimp/dactyl sources
21:29 iaj: Thats sufficient :)?
21:30 iaj: is there a description of the dactyl apI?
21:30 iaj: api?
21:32 Chousuke: nah
