20:56 iaj: one question: you use vimp or pent?
20:58 iaj: is there some big adv from pent > vimp?
20:58 Chousuke: pentadactyl
20:58 iaj: i can't get my plugins to run properly :(
20:58 Chousuke: well, it's more actively developed :P
20:58 iaj: stella asdf...
20:58 iaj: i need to fix those 2 to run with pent
20:58 iaj: is that hard to do?
20:58 Chousuke: I only use the noscript plugin
20:58 Chousuke: no idea. You should probably ask on the channel.
20:58 iaj: oh and do you have any other colorscheme?
20:58 Chousuke: nah
20:59 Chousuke: just a few tweaks to the default
21:01 iaj: do you happen to know which ones?
21:01 iaj: replace liberator with something i guess :)
21:01 Chousuke: dactyl
21:01 Chousuke: but dactyl should have an alias for liberator
21:02 Chousuke: so try running the plugin and fixing the errors one by one
21:02 iaj: ahhh thanks
21:02 Chousuke: (well, errors and warnings)
21:02 iaj: you use a color scheme?
21:02 Chousuke: nah

21:49 iaj: but so you don't use hint mode pretty much do you?
21:50 Chousuke: ? I use hints all the time.
21:51 iaj: really so you can read that yellow dotty thingie am I right about that?
21:52 Chousuke: yellow dotty what? 
21:52 Chousuke: I don't read the links themselves most of the time, just the hint labels
21:52 Chousuke: which are red and white :P
21:58 iaj: red and white?? hmm, strange... if theres a lot of hints on the page i can't really figure them out and distinguish them..
21:58 Chousuke: ah, well, that
21:58 Chousuke: that's a problem sometimes
21:58 Chousuke: I use charhints. it helps
21:58 Chousuke: and I've slightly increased the hint label size
