02:57 iaj: hy mate, you up?
02:58 anekos: hi, i am down
02:58 iaj: what happened:(?
02:58 anekos: head ache
02:58 iaj: too much javascripting? :-)
02:58 anekos: lol, no
02:59 iaj: sorry Im just trying to adapt your asdfghjkl.js plugin to work with pentadactyl - I fixed the option settings - but it still doesn't want to trigger - I guess you happen to know why - correct??
03:00 anekos: I dont know... 
03:00 anekos: have you get any errors?
03:01 iaj: no errors at all :( i thought the modes.extended and modes.HINTS isn't set in pentadactyl maybe - but even after commenting those lines out its not triggering
03:01 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294863  that's my edited version
03:01 anekos: hmmmmm
03:03 anekos: I need to check the penta source codes for the fix, but I will not do so.
03:04 iaj: ok.. is there any particular place where I;d need to take a look?
03:05 anekos: maybe event.js
03:05 anekos: or hints.js ??
03:06 iaj: thanks :)
