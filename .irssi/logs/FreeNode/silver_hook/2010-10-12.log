14:59 silver_hook: Hey.
14:59 iaj: Did you get that prompt from that url working?
15:00 silver_hook: Not yet.
15:00 silver_hook: To be honest, I went for a nap just before :3
15:00 silver_hook: I hope I'll get something working today, but I'm not sure.
15:00 iaj: Hahah :-)
15:00 silver_hook: And you? Any progress?
15:00 iaj: Yeah... well
15:00 iaj: I'm at work
15:01 iaj: don't have any interest in working tho
15:01 iaj: So I'm spending time on my zsh prompt
15:01 iaj: ;p
15:01 silver_hook: Is/will it (be) publicly available somewhere?
15:02 silver_hook: BTW, this one also looks interesting: http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/
15:02 silver_hook: ...if nothing else because it defines PS3 and PS4 as well.
15:02 iaj: yeah i know that one... but I'm more interested in the VCS stuff
15:02 iaj: hmm no it ain't public yet.. its just... well.. experimental atm :)
15:03 silver_hook: Well, mine's not even experimental yet :P
15:03 silver_hook: BRB, food.
15:04 silver_hook: Did you see this yet?
15:04 silver_hook: http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
