00:31 mtvee: thats works much better than what i have been using
00:31 mtvee: let me fire up some nasty PHP or something here
00:31 iaj: heh its working?
00:32 iaj: well I think you need to make some adjustments if PHP.. but
00:32 iaj: in general... it uses C-p when keyword completion was invoked (eg. no dot or slash in the filename)
00:32 iaj: or omni completion (followed by C-N when menu is up) if omnifunc is set
00:32 iaj: and a dot is in... but I think php uses -> so I guess you need to add that 
00:33 iaj: hasphpthingie :)
00:33 mtvee: yeah, and ruby and all that other good stuff. you be around for a bit?
00:34 iaj: heheh.. yeah :-)
00:34 iaj: ruby is using -> as well?
00:34 mtvee: how do you like eclim btw?
00:34 iaj:     elseif curline =~ '.*\(\w\|[\])]\)\(\.\|::\|->\)\w*\%' . cnum . 'c' &&
00:34 iaj: stolen from supertab :D
00:35 iaj: ah.. well... I'm still getting into it
00:35 iaj: I don't like eclipse - too slow
00:35 iaj: And I want to achieve EVERYTHING in vim.
00:35 iaj: that's y I'm switching even if I'm less efficient (at first)
00:35 mtvee: haha, sounds like we are on the same path ;)
00:35 iaj: once you entered the vim way
00:35 iaj: you never switch back :)
00:35 iaj: did you try eclipse?
00:36 mtvee: yeah, i did java programming for about 6-7 years
00:36 iaj: Really? Woah...
00:36 iaj: nice.
00:36 mtvee: intellij mostly tho. eclipse is a terible thing to use
00:36 iaj: I was digging my way around of java.
00:36 iaj: Yeh.. heh.. i like Netbeans much better
00:37 mtvee: yeah, i havent tried that for a long time but i hear good things
00:37 iaj: but the good thing of Eclipse / Eclim is.. that when I'm at university and my prof. needs to do some stuff.. I can just fire up Eclipse :D
00:37 mtvee: i gave up java a few years ago
00:37 iaj: its blazinlgy fast.
00:37 iaj: Well compared to eclipse.
00:37 mtvee: until andoird showed up :) now im back
00:37 iaj: But I don't like java anyhow.
00:37 iaj: :-DD
00:37 iaj: Wanna learn Python & Ruby
00:37 iaj: Just don't have any time to spare atm.
00:37 mtvee: both excellent choices
00:38 mtvee: ruby, like vim, will change the way you think
00:38 iaj: really?
00:38 iaj: Which would you rate higher?
00:39 mtvee: well, depends on the job really
00:39 mtvee: each has strengths and weakness depeding on the project, you know?
00:40 iaj: hmm...
00:40 iaj: Yeah maybe. 
00:40 iaj: Damn :-D
00:40 iaj: Which is your favourite?
00:42 mtvee: hehe, it's really hard to say, i like them both a lot. i have been coding python a lot longer but ruby is very lispy and i have been coding lisp for a lot longer than that so it feel pretty comfortable too
00:44 mtvee: ruby is a lot of fun, python is rock solid and has a great library
00:46 iaj: hehehe
00:46 iaj: a lot of fun :D
00:47 mtvee: yeah, you can do some crazy stuff with ruby code

00:53 iaj: :-)
00:53 iaj: what purposes do you use ruby for?
00:54 mtvee: mostly system stuff, same with python
00:54 mtvee: but im a sysadmin so that makes some sense i think ;)
00:54 iaj: ahhh :-)
00:54 iaj: yeah, I think so
00:54 iaj: what does a sysadmin need android for :D
00:55 mtvee: hehe, ssh into my servers from the beach ;)
00:55 iaj: ;ppppppp
00:55 mtvee: im a programmer too, i dunno, prgrammer/sys admin
00:56 iaj: good combination
