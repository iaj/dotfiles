00:59  gordboy: jon_athon: you can diddle the ps output. ps -eo pid,gid,cmd
00:59  xangua: jon_athon: jum........
01:00  jon_athon: gordboy, thanks
01:01  gordboy: jon_athon: so to isolate a single process (by name) : ps -eo pid,gid,cmd | grep [c]ommand
01:01  Muzer: akiwiguy: kaltxì ;)
01:01  mbroeker: gordboy, ps -o pid,gid $(pidof xchat) :)
01:01  akiwiguy: kaltxì
01:01  jon_athon: ooo that's neat, I can do pid,gid,uid,cmd  :-)
01:01  akiwiguy: i see the accented i, pidgin must screw it up
01:02  Muzer: yeah, IIRC Pidgin only supports UTF-8 input
01:02  gordboy: mbroeker: yeah neat
01:02  lautriv: wolfric, probably if you tell us what the goal is
01:02  Muzer: xchat by default sends in ISO-8859-1 if possible; UTF-8 if not
01:02  Muzer: (also, Pidgin is a horrible IRC client)
01:02  akiwiguy: yes it is
01:02 * akiwiguy gets XChat
01:03  jon_athon: gordboy, thanks for the info, I am reading up on the linux kernel and how every process takes the UID and GID of the user it is running on behalf of... interesting stuff I always thought processes had their own set of IDs
01:03  xangua: you can set pidgin to use any codification you want Muzer akiwiguy
01:03  Giant81: xchat is descent
01:03 * akiwiguy looks in Pidgin settings
01:03  Giant81: irssi is good for cli
01:03  akiwiguy: Giant81: im on windows
01:03  Giant81: used to use bitchx
01:04  xangua: akiwiguy: advanced> codification> ISO 8859-1 > disable and enable your account
01:04  Muzer: xangua: IIRC it can't intelligently figure it out on a per-message basis, though
01:04  Giant81: ewww only descent irc clients on windows you have to pay for
01:04  Muzer: Giant81: nah, there are unofficial builds for Windows
01:04  Muzer: like YChat
01:04 * Giant81 goes googling
01:04  akiwiguy: yeah
01:04  akiwiguy: downloading YChat now
01:04  Giant81: I like mirc, with noname script
01:05  Muzer: apparently the Windows builds cost money because it's a giant arse pain for them to compile them
01:05  Muzer: can't say I blame them
01:05  akiwiguy: mirc sucks
01:05  Giant81: I think they ahve to purchase the SDK's to compile for windows
01:05  Muzer: :/
01:05  akiwiguy: couls use Cygwin
01:05  akiwiguy: thats free
01:06  Giant81: does xchat work with cygwin?
01:06  Giant81: I've used irssi
01:06  akiwiguy: you could compile it for  cygwin
01:06  mbroeker: i have used xchat on windows with gtk
01:06  Muzer: irssi sucks if you're on more than a few networks
01:06  akiwiguy: install gtk2 in cygwin and compile
01:06  akiwiguy: never used irssi
01:06  Muzer: although I keep thinking
01:06  Muzer: "I would love feature X in xchat"
01:07  Muzer: all the time
01:07  Muzer: it's so damn annoying
01:07  Muzer: I wish there was actually a GOOD IRC client
01:07  Giant81: irssi is good I think if you are a cli junky
01:07  Zharf: irsrsi
01:07  akiwiguy: write one then
01:07  Muzer: I am a CLI junky, but I've heard that irssi sucks for multiple networks
01:07  Giant81: I know enough about computers to know whwat I like and don't like, don't know enough yet to fix waht I don't like
01:08  Muzer: and I'm on about 10 networks, so yeah...
01:08  akiwiguy: I like my Xorg
01:08  robinetd: Muzer: It works fine.
01:08  Zharf: Muzer, don't listen to hearsay
01:08  Muzer: really?
01:08  robinetd: yarly
01:08  Zharf: yarly
01:08  Muzer: maybe I should put in the time to learn it then
01:08  akiwiguy: Muzer: what 10 networks?
01:08  Zharf: I'm on 5 networks on this irssi
01:08  Muzer: OFTC, Freenode, EFNet, my own server, Learn Na'vi, Gamesurge, WormNet, OperaNet
01:08  Muzer: so 8
01:08  Muzer: I have been on more in the past
01:09  akiwiguy: your own server?
01:09  Muzer: yes
01:09  Zharf: I have my own server (bitlbee) too :p
01:09  Muzer: just use it to talk with friends
01:09  Muzer: basically
01:09  Muzer: well, I say server
01:09  akiwiguy: i tried to set up an irc server once
01:09  akiwiguy: pain in the arse
01:09  Muzer: more like 10-year-old laptop sitting in the corner of the one with the fastest connection's house
01:09  akiwiguy: hah
01:09  Muzer: IRC servers are piss easy to set up
01:09  Muzer: this one was anyway
01:09  Muzer: (Undernet)
01:10  Muzer: 1) Install
01:10  Muzer: 2) Connect
01:10  Muzer: :P
01:10  Giant81: I wish I could get people using irc at work
01:10  akiwiguy: i tried 4 different servers, none of them would work
01:11  akiwiguy: i wish my school didnt block irc
01:11  Giant81: setup dev and IT channels
01:11  Giant81: get a freshell.org acccount, do port redirection
01:11  akiwiguy: they block ssh and telnet aswell
01:11  akiwiguy: bastards
01:12  Muzer: it's weird - I'm in sixth form now (the gap between compulsory education and uni in the UK), and the school I'm with also has some of the lessons in another school, like computing - yet the school that is computing-specialist (the one that I go to for computing) has a MUCH stricter and generally worse network setup than the main one (which, in comparison, I love the network setup of)
01:12  numberz: mibbit then or another web based service
01:12  Muzer: Install anyterm on your server
01:12  Muzer: works a bloody treat
01:12  Muzer: PHP ssh client
01:12  akiwiguy: they block mibbit and webchat.freenode.net
01:13  akiwiguy: yeah
01:13  Muzer: I'm actually amazed at how well it works
01:13  Muzer: I've yet to find a mainstream browser in which it fails - and I can access it absolutely anywhere
01:14  akiwiguy: yay xchat is downloaded
01:14  Muzer: and it works with everything, so you're not just limited to a CLI - proper CUIs will work too, like text editors or irssi
01:14  akiwiguy: cool
01:14  akiwiguy: damn
01:15  akiwiguy: anyterm requires a server side daemon
01:15  akiwiguy: im using shared hosting
01:15  Muzer: oh :(
01:15  sauvin: I can't get sound enabled on my netbook, at least, not yet, and I'm not sure I care. It's WAY too slow to play movies on anyway.
01:15  Muzer: install it on your box at home, then use it as a bridge
01:15  akiwiguy: my box isnt accessible from the web
01:15  Muzer: ah :(
01:15  lautriv: sauvin, specs ?
01:16  akiwiguy: could try and persuade by friend to install it on his asterisk box
01:16  sauvin: lautriv, it's an Acer Aspire thingie (presently busy grabbing updates) with an Atom.
01:17 * akiwiguy will be back soon, switching clients
01:18 --- rocketmaster is now known as vizzy
01:18  lautriv: sauvin, o use some PIII/1GHz to stream content via network and they do fine, yours will do also, tell me about graphics
01:19  sauvin: Can't right now. It's downloading updates, and at the moment, that seems to be all it can manage to do. It's pretty slow.
01:19  sauvin: It can keep up with my typing, so I'm not going to grouse.
01:19  sauvin: Actually...
01:20  sauvin: It's on the table way over there ------->  I just ssh'd into it.
01:20  akiwiguy: back
01:21  lautriv: sauvin, another time then, i'll go to bed CYA
01:21  sauvin: hee... gute nacht!
01:24  Muzer: out of interest... why does make xconfig seem to be so cumbersome?
01:25  Muzer: I sort of expected it to be more usable than the CUI version, but after trying it out, I hate it with a passion
01:26  Muzer: however, xconfig does have a search
01:26  Muzer: and it actually works sometimes
01:27 * akiwiguy needs a decent Windows video editor
01:27  windowshasyou: akiwiguy: so ask in #windows
01:28  akiwiguy: maybe...
01:28  Zharf: akiwiguy, adobe premier
01:28  Zharf: ;)
01:28  akiwiguy: I've got that sitting on my server
01:28  akiwiguy: but OMG that uses up shitloads of ram
01:29  windowshasyou: You expected a lite and decent app for windows?
01:30  Zharf: akiwiguy, any proper video editing will need a lot of memory...
01:30  akiwiguy: yeah
01:30  peturi: How can i fix this? http://alturl.com/45r7a
01:30  Zharf: windowshasyou, right back at you for linux
01:31  windowshasyou: Zharf: video editing wise, you got me.
01:31  akiwiguy: the installer whines at you if you have less than $GB of ram
01:31  akiwiguy: 4gb*
01:43 --- shadowm_laptop2 is now known as shadowm_laptop
01:44 --- AndrewMC` is now known as AndrewMC
01:46  MrElendig: Muzer: there is gconfig too
01:47  Apophasis: Newbie question, and I don't wan to start a religious debate, but as a beginner programmer, which programming language is all around better to learn-- Python or Perl?
01:48  MrElendig: Apophasis: imo python
01:48  Zharf: neither
01:48  MrElendig: didn't we have this discussion just the other day btw?
01:48  sauvin: MrElendig, you know better. This discussion will never end.
01:48  Apophasis: My first day here.
01:48  sauvin: Apophasis, on what basis would you decide which is better?
01:48  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: Just those two options?
01:48  MrElendig: Apophasis: C + python + scheme/lisp/haskell
01:49  sauvin: You don't want to inflict C, scheme, lisp or haskell on n00b s.
01:49  MrElendig: sauvin: shceme is easy >_>
01:49  Apophasis: sauvin& Psi-Jacl: Well, not just those two opotions... But those were the ones recommended to me.
01:50  Psi-Jack: Yeaah.. Using Gnome pure instead of Unity is SO much better.
01:50  sauvin: By whom and on what basis?
01:50  sauvin: Psi-Jack, Gnome blows.
01:50  MrElendig: and some basics in C can be nice to understand what's actually happening
01:50  Accelerator: My CloudLinux server seems to have some weird glitch.
01:50  Psi-Jack: sauvin: Agreed there too.
01:50  sauvin: MrElendig, I agree completely, but C isn't something I'd slam a newb face-first into.
01:50  Psi-Jack: sauvin: But, KDE on a netbook like this, not gonna be very useful
01:50  Apophasis: Learning for servers/networking.
01:50  Accelerator: Whenever I chown something, it removed the public read permissions.
01:51  Accelerator: removes*
01:51  sauvin: Apophasis, "for servers/networking"?
01:51  MrElendig: Accelerator: python is excelent for network/server/daemon/client stuff
01:51  Giant81: working through some stuff for my linux class
01:51  Giant81: the idea is to backup certain files on a system, then delete them after
01:51  MrElendig: has loads of good libs for that
01:51  sauvin: So does perl. :P
01:51  Giant81: I'm thinking find | cpio then  | to rm?
01:51  Apophasis: Perl and Python were both recommended to me as good languagse to learn for networking stuff.
01:52  Accelerator: I don't know if that has much to do with my bug, but thanks lol.
01:52  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: By whom? Idiots with wings?
01:52 --- Muzer is now known as MuzerAway
01:52  Giant81: but wouldn't the | from cpio just push the output from cpio to rm?
01:52  Apophasis: Uh, no. By a lot of people.
01:52  Accelerator: Is there a chmod flag to just give files public read permissions (not modifying there entire permissions)
01:52  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: As in, idiots with wings?
01:52  Giant81: chmod o+r file
01:53  Accelerator: chmod o+r didn't work.
01:53  sauvin: Perl and python are both excellent languages for network/server crap.
01:53  Giant81: what are the current permissions?
01:53  Accelerator: -rw-r--r--
01:53  Giant81: so that's 644
01:54  Giant81: it worked
01:54  Giant81: 0 is r
01:54  Apophasis: sauvin: Yes. This is what I've heard from everyone.
01:54  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: Cause, that makes very very little sense, "Good langauges to learn for networking stuff."
01:54  Accelerator: Oh, so it is, nevermind then.
01:54  Accelerator: Misread that
01:54  Giant81: owner is rw, group is r and everyone else is r
01:54  Accelerator: So why is this installation script giving me an internal server error then I wonder.
01:54  Apophasis: Psi-Jack: What do you mean? What are you implying?
01:55  Psi-Jack: sauvin: Okay, so with JUST gnome, and Compiz enabled, with auto-dimming, I'm getting a rough estimated 3 hours battery life.
01:55  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: I'm implying the statement: "Good languages to learn for networking stuff." has absolutely no sensical meaning whatsoever.
01:55  sauvin: I'm running KDE and no freaking wobblies.
01:55 --- Shaded is now known as mikaeI
01:56  Psi-Jack: sauvin: How much RAM your netbook have
01:56  Psi-Jack: ?
01:56  sauvin: Psi-Jack, I used a couple of perl modules to create a custom set of clients and servers between my laptops because at the time I didn't understand how passwordless ssh worked.
01:57  sauvin: Psi-Jack, looks like two gigs.
01:57  Psi-Jack: sauvin: Heh, I need to upgrade mine... IF I decide to keep it.
01:57 --- MuzerAway is now known as Muzer
01:57  Psi-Jack: I've got 1 GB
01:57 --- mikaeI is now known as Shaded
01:57  sauvin: yea, a single gig is going to be megaslow, even slower than it already is.
01:57  Psi-Jack: It's pretty fast though.
01:57  sauvin: Not fast enough to play movies on.
01:57  Psi-Jack: Sure it is.
01:57  Psi-Jack: I have already.
01:57  Apophasis: Psi-Jack: So are you going after my wording, or are you suggesting that programming languages ideal for networking?
01:58  Psi-Jack: Apophasis
01:58  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: Wording
01:58  Psi-Jack: Your statement makes 0 sense.
01:58  Accelerator: Here's a noob question. What does "d" stand for in permissions.
01:58  Psi-Jack: directory
01:58  sauvin: directory.
01:58  Psi-Jack: Ta-Da
01:58  Apophasis: Why was everyone else able to understand it?
01:58  Accelerator: So it just means it's a directory?
01:58  sauvin: Yup!
01:58  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: Nobody was. :p
01:58  Accelerator: Right then, hahah.
01:58  Accelerator: Thanks
01:59  Apophasis: <MrElendig> Apophasis: C + python + scheme/lisp/haskell; <MrElendig> Accelerator: python is excelent for network/server/daemon/client stuff
01:59  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: There is no "programming language" that is better or worse at networking stuff. Pretty much any powerful language can do it, and can do it well.
01:59  Apophasis: Ah.
01:59  Psi-Jack: And there is no language better or worse at doing so.
02:00  Accelerator: Well, a brief Google is suggesting mod_security could be causing it, not surprising.
02:00  sauvin: Psi-Jack, yea, but some *languages* are easier to learn.
02:01  Psi-Jack: Not really.
02:01  Apophasis: Psi: Right. But by "better" I mean overall best for learning as a newbie. Why are people recommending these ones? Is it because of convention?
02:01  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: It's because "better" questions are each one's own personal opinions, nothing more, nothing less.
02:02  Apophasis: I don't want to pick up a language that is going to make it difficult to relate to other ones.
02:02  Psi-Jack: Apophasis: It's going to.
02:02  sauvin: Psi-Jack, you're trying to tell me that C or C++ is every bit as easy to learn for somebody with minimal computer experience and zero coding experience?
02:03  Psi-Jack: Python is nothing like perl, perl is nothing like python. Neither are nothing like PHP or C
02:03  Psi-Jack: sauvin; People with minimal computer experience don't get into programming.
02:04  sauvin: Only an hour and a half to go to complete downloading updates.
02:05  Giant81: tar -cf /backup/backup.tar 'find / -size >100M -nouser' --remove-files  <-- would find all files over 100M with no user, back them up then delete them?
02:05  sauvin: I'm an idiot for doing that while watching movies over ssh anyway :sigh:
02:05  Accelerator: You have to have atleast some computer knowlege to become a decent programmar.
02:05  Accelerator: or you'll really be forced to learn one way or another.
02:07  sauvin: I didn't know a damn thing about computers when I started teaching myself BASIC.
02:08  Psi-Jack: sauvin: And you're also a freak. *ducks*
02:08  sauvin: In a way, I suppose I am, just on those grounds.
02:09  akiwiguy: ohai
02:09  sauvin: Used what I learned to automate XY table patterns for a pre-NC kind of manufacturing process, too.
02:14  jillsmitt: hello
02:14 * Psi-Jack is watching Dexter on his netbook, crisp, clear, smooth, and it's extrmely high quality video. ;)
02:21  andybiker: Hi, I need some bootloader help.
02:21 --- Muzer is now known as MuzerAway
02:22  b0nn: andybiker: just fire straight into the problem, if someone can help they will
02:22  vandemar: another grub victim?
02:22  andybiker: I copied my Mandriva onto a new larger hard disk using dd commands and tried the same with the bootloader
02:22 * Psi-Jack starts making grub of vandemar.
02:22  andybiker: when I start the drive, the screen fills with GRUB
02:22 * b0nn suggests that's already been done
02:23  vandemar: well first of all you don't want to dd a smaller drive onto a larger one
02:23  b0nn: second of all, does mandriva use UUIDs?
02:23  Psi-Jack: vandemar: Umm, excuse me?
02:23  Psi-Jack: That's actually perfectly plausible, to dd a smaller drive into a larger one.
02:24  andybiker: I tried using the live disk to re-establuish the grub without fail. Mandriva does use UUID, unfortunately unless you edit it out
02:24  vandemar: not really.  it assumes the partition table is going to be the same, which it generally won't be, and it assumes he wants all the same filesystem sizes, which also generally is not what you want
02:24  andybiker: without success!
02:24  Psi-Jack: vandemar: You resize /after/ the process, done correctly.
02:25  andybiker: My home is the primary directory
02:25  andybiker: sd*1
02:25  Psi-Jack: andybiker: Essentially the MBR is hosed, partially, but repairable. Boot off a rescue disk, mount and chroot into your new drive's partitions, and fix grub.
02:25  b0nn: and get the new UUIDs?
02:26  Psi-Jack: UUIDs aren;t changed by the process of dd.
02:26  Psi-Jack: They are copied /exactly/,
02:26  andybiker: can I use this system? the drive isn't mounted yet
02:26  b0nn: Psi-Jack: I'm not a fan of UUIDs, I prefer the good ole days where you just mapped to a device
02:26  andybiker: mandriva live takes about 5 mins to get going!
02:26  Psi-Jack: andybiker: You can. mount the partitions/volumes appropriately, bind mount /dev into the temporary root target's /dev, mount proc into the target, and chroot into it.
02:27  b0nn: Psi-Jack: therfore I refuse to learn how the work properly :)
02:27  Psi-Jack: Then use your distro's grub installation methods appropriately from cli, and grub will be fixed.
02:27  andybiker: I might need some help here. hang on...  making folders and mounting
02:27  Psi-Jack: Go go dd power go. :)
02:27  sirellyn: Anyone have problems with a mac mini detecting more than 4 GBs of ram w Ubuntu 10.04?
02:28  Psi-Jack: vandemar: Point of the story is, bad help is worse than backing off because you don't know any better. ;)
02:29  vandemar: Psi-Jack: there are limitations on the partition and filesystem resize process that I would assume someone who comes here asking for help moving a system between drives doesn't want to deal with
02:30  Psi-Jack: Hey, he obviously wants to know proper and good powerful procedures. ;)
02:30  vanity: I have tow machines "weak" and "powerful-server". weak has no GPU. I'm using "weak", I ssh into "powerful-server". I want to run an application (that opens up an OpenGL window) on "powerful-server". However, I don't want X-fowarding. I want the window to open up on "powerful-server" (my code reads back from the OpenGL buffers & saves the data). How do I do this?
02:30  vandemar: Psi-Jack: but if you want to walk him through fixing things when he reveals that his /home partition needs to expand to the whole disk, but is sandwiched between other partitions, go right ahead :)
02:30  Psi-Jack: GPU just means, Graphics Processing Unit, and yes, you do have those.
02:32  andybiker: I have changed the fstab to be aligned to /dev rather than UUIDs
02:33  andybiker: Psi-Jack, How do I do the binding and chrooting? I haven't chrooted since lfs and that is a bad example to follow!
02:34  Psi-Jack: andybiker: mount -o bind /dev /mnt/target/dev; mount -o proc /target/proc; chroot /mnt/target /bin/bash
02:34  andybiker: where target is the / partition?
02:35  Psi-Jack: Right
02:35  andybiker: Let's try ....
02:35  Psi-Jack: andybiker: basically your overlapping your existing /dev into the target's /dev so you have device nodes, and proc because, well, grub needs proc. ;)
02:36  Psi-Jack: Maybe it's mount -t proc /mnt/target/proc
02:37  andybiker: I need to add the partition to fstab...
02:37  Psi-Jack: You need to correct anything in the target's fstab, yes.
02:40  andybiker: [root@localhost andrew]# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/disk2/dev
02:40  andybiker: [root@localhost andrew]# mount -o proc /mnt/disk2/procmount: can't find /mnt/disk2/proc in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
02:41  andybiker: /mnt/disk2 = new disk /
02:41  Psi-Jack: andybiker: do mount -t proc instead
02:41  andybiker: yuck
02:42  Psi-Jack: Or we can just do mount -o bind /proc /mnt/disk2/proc
02:42  andybiker: That might be better
02:43  andybiker: I'm in chroot
02:44  Psi-Jack: Excelent.
02:44  fedorauser162: can anyone tell me in the heck my cd/dvd drive ALWAYS wants to close the second it is done opening? i hit eject and it opens then immediately snaps closed
02:44  Psi-Jack: Now you just need to grub-install from there, correctly.
02:44  Psi-Jack: Or similar, if your distro has specific tools to ease that up more.
02:45  andybiker: fyi, even though Mandriva use grub2, it still calls the grub config menu.lst
02:46  Psi-Jack: I dunno, I don't use Mandriva, and never will.
02:47  vandemar: fedorauser162: that must be your distro.  dvd drives don't automatically do that
02:47  fedorauser162: vandemar, :(
02:48  Psi-Jack: fedorauser162: Actually.
02:48  andybiker: rebooting and reassigning hard disk order. Thanks Psi-Jack and cross fingers!
02:49  Psi-Jack: fedorauser162: That could be related to your DVD drive's firmware. Most distros poll the activity of the drive so it can readilly provide a mountable target for automounting. Your drive may be taking that "poll" as, close and read now.
02:49  fedorauser162: Psi-Jack, any way to modify that?
02:49  fedorauser162: Psi-Jack, its like the olympics trying to grab the disc out
02:49  Psi-Jack: Firmware updates, MAYBE.
02:50  Psi-Jack: That is, for the optic drive itself, which may or may not be available.
02:50  fedorauser162: hmm
02:50  Psi-Jack: And this is just theory, but I have seen it too, despite vandemar's comment. ;)
02:50  vandemar: fedorauser162: there's a comment in ubuntu's forums that setting ev.cdrom.autoclose = 0 in /etc/sysctl.conf might help
02:51  Psi-Jack: Oooh, good find, maybe..
02:51  vandemar: which would be /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoclose
02:51  vandemar: I think they left out the 'd'
02:52  Psi-Jack: Easy way to find out with the sysctl tool.
02:52  fedorauser162: i dont have that line in my sysctl.cong
02:52  vandemar: right, add it
02:52  Psi-Jack: fedorauser162: You add it, not every definition is listed there. Trust me, there's hundreds or even thousands.
02:53  vandemar: then  `echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoclose` and see if it still happens
02:53  fedorauser162: done
02:53  Psi-Jack: Hmmm, I wonder how Linux Mint would be on this netbook.
02:54  Psi-Jack: I do like how Mint has their customization done, and the application menu is customized for mint with a searchlet.
02:54  fedorauser162: hey it stayedopen!
02:54  fedorauser162: lemme reboot and see if it sticks
02:55  vandemar: I suspect that's not the default because it might have some side effects, like not closing when you want it to, but I guess most people have no problem closing the tray manually
02:56  vandemar: you could check your dvd drive's manufacturer's website for new firmware
02:56 * Psi-Jack gets mint to try it out. heh
03:00  numberz: what's the easiest way of finding out what is using your disk space in linux? short of du -sh /path and considering naututils doesn't give folder sizes for everything instead just listed how many items in them instead?
03:00  Psi-Jack: There's actually a GUI tool for that, or two, for linux that visually displays it.
03:01  bagira: numberz, try df -h
03:01  numberz: bagira: yeah already tried that
03:01  Psi-Jack: kdirstat, is one.
03:01  Psi-Jack: Disk Usage Analyzer another.
03:02  MrElendig: numberz: ncdu ftw?
03:02  MrElendig: numberz: also xdiscusage
03:02  numberz: oh ncdu looks very nice thanks :)
03:02  Psi-Jack: Heh, cool, Philesight, web-based tool that does similar reports. ;)
03:02  vandemar: it's too bad slocate/mlocate doesn't store file sizes; it's the obvious candidate because most people already have it run nightly
03:02  MrElendig: xdiskusage*
03:03  vandemar: or does it?  I don't see a way to query it for large files
03:03  MrElendig: vandemar: mlocate doesn't
03:03  MrElendig: dunno about the other locate implimentations
03:03  MrElendig: there are like 10 of those >_>
03:05  tokam: how can I do a timestamp synchronisation of 2 servers?
03:05  vandemar: ntp?
03:05  BCMM: tokam: do you mean synchronise thier clocks?
03:05  tokam: yes
03:05  gordboy: numberz: du | sort -n, baobab, filelight
03:06  fedorauser162: vandemar, ok i rebooted and problem returned. if i rerun echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/autoclose the prob is fixed
03:06  BCMM: they both got 'net access?
03:06  BCMM: tokam: use ntp
03:06  tokam: I am reading here http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Kerberos-Infrastructure-HOWTO/time-sync.html
03:06  vandemar: fedorauser162: did you add dev.cdrom.autoclose = 0 to /etc/sysctl.conf ?
03:06  BCMM: it's very good
03:06  fedorauser162: vandemar, i did
03:07  vandemar: fedorauser162: did you add the first 'd'?
03:07  BCMM: tokam: woah, outdated
03:07  fedorauser162: vandemar, oh oops
03:07  fedorauser162: lol
03:07  BCMM: tokam: those docs suggest using cron to sync every so often
03:07  tokam: I think I need to do all this for setting up a slave dns server
03:07  tokam: with key
03:07  fedorauser162: vandemar, i did now lol
03:08  tokam: BCMM: how to do it in a secure way?
03:08  BCMM: tokam: i would've though a more normal approach would be running ntpd
03:08  BCMM: tokam: ntpd keeps running, constantly keeping the time accurate
03:08  andybiker: Hi again, how do I clear the bootloader on a hard disk?
03:08  BCMM: and it is very accurate indeed
03:09  andybiker: still getting GRUB pages
03:09  BCMM: tokam: you can configure some access stuff for ntpd
03:10  BCMM: tokam: like whether to also act as an ntp server, and which machines are allowed to connect if you do
03:10  MrElendig: andybiker: just tell your box to boot from the other disc that has the bootloader you want to use?
03:10  tokam: should I stop ntp?
03:10  BCMM: you can save some bandwidth and improve sync accuracy by using one machine as a server, if they're on the same LAN
03:11  tokam: is it dangerous to use ntp without configuring it all?
03:11  BCMM: tokam: as in, server 1 gets time from internet, server 2 gets time from server 1
03:11  BCMM: tokam: depends on your distro's default config file
03:12  BCMM: tokam: but the worst that could happen, assuming no bugs, would be someone using your machine to set their clock, and wasting some bandwidth
03:12  tokam: :D
03:12  BCMM: tokam: remember that ntp is a protocol, not a program
03:12  tokam: thats no problem
03:13  BCMM: the software i would use is ntpd
03:13  tokam: and how to sync server 2 now (server 1 has ntp started)
03:13  tokam: ntpd -4 [iphere] ?
03:14  BCMM: tokam: you probably want to let init scripts start ntpd for you
03:14  andybiker: Psi-Jack & others, would dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda/ bs=446 count=1 do the trick?
03:14  BCMM: tokam: are these servers on the same lan?
03:14  Psi-Jack: No
03:14  tokam: no different zones.
03:14  Psi-Jack: You have an additional / there.
03:15  BCMM: tokam: if they are on seperate internet connections, just sync them both from pool servers
03:15  andybiker: I found that in linuxquestions forum
03:15  Psi-Jack: heh, IRCing from the netbook, so please excuse my horrible typing.
03:15  Psi-Jack: andybiker, /dev/hda/ == bad
03:15  Psi-Jack: ending / == invalid
03:15  andybiker: of=/dev/sdb in my case
03:15  tokam: ok, not to waste bandwith ya?
03:15  Psi-Jack: andybiker, And what are you trying to do?
03:16  andybiker: empty the grub
03:16  BCMM: tokam: amongst other things
03:16  Psi-Jack: bs=446, count 1? Then, yes. That should clear the MBR without trashing partitions.
03:16  Psi-Jack: Course, it will be completely unbootable until you do something about it.
03:17  andybiker: so dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=446 count=1
03:17  BCMM: if you make even a tiny typo everything will blow up in your face
03:17  BCMM: just a heads up
03:17  Psi-Jack: BCMM, Exactly.
03:17  Psi-Jack: Hey, what's that ticking sound near you, BCMM?
03:18  BCMM: a hard disk, Psi-Jack.
03:18  tokam: is there a good server for german time?
03:18  syn-ack: time is time.
03:18  BCMM: tokam: use the europe ntp pool
03:18  andybiker: Now I can chroot in and replace it with  a clean slate
03:18  BCMM: tokam: syn-ack is right, time is time. unix boxen use gmt
03:18  syn-ack: yep
03:18  Psi-Jack: boxes. ;P
03:19  tokam: found some servers.
03:19  BCMM: tokam: (and correct to local time in userspace)
03:19  Psi-Jack: And more specfically, UTC
03:19  sauvin: Boxen.
03:19  Psi-Jack: s/n/s/
03:19  syn-ack: honestly, I don't think there would be a big deal as to which server you use since ntp accounts for jitter anyway
03:19  sauvin: Boxen is, in fact, a legitimate and accepted part of the perl community.
03:19  sauvin: So are Vaxen. :P
03:19  BCMM: allows different users to be in different time zones, also means file access times and the like are meaningful even in other countries
03:20  syn-ack: I use an internal server on my LAN though since I don
03:20  syn-ack: 't allow 123 out except for that machine
03:20  sauvin: syn-ack, I'd use UTC anyway.
03:20  andybiker: trying to reboot sdb again
03:20  BCMM: tokam: that said, it is best to use closer servers for lower latency, thus the ntp europe server pool
03:20  Psi-Jack: Well, netbook's CERTAINLY much easier to carry around than my laptop. heh
03:20  syn-ack: I use UTC only for my BIOS time.
03:20  tokam: do I need such a startup script? http://www.akadia.com/services/ntp_synchronize.html
03:21  BCMM: tokam: europe.pool.ntp.org
03:21  sauvin: Psi-Jack, like I said: fits in the coat pocket. I've been spending part of today re-discovering my only major beef with it: it's impossible to type on.
03:21  syn-ack: BCMM, seriously though, I don't think it makes much difference since, like I said, ntp account for jitter.,
03:21  BCMM: dns round-robbin, spreads the load over various european servers
03:21  syn-ack: that's just me though
03:21  tokam: hat about these ones? http://pastebin.com/ESyX4tg6
03:21  Psi-Jack: sauvin, heheh, yeaaaah, it's definitely different to type on.
03:21  BCMM: syn-ack: accounting for latency is easy, but how can you account for jitter?
03:21  sauvin: syn-ack, if I understand it properly, jitter correction is statistical in nature. Best to minimise it.
03:22  BCMM: tokam: doesn't your distro ship init scripts?
03:22  syn-ack: Hell, for that matter, my watch does too and it picks up the main US signal out of Colorado Springs
03:22  Psi-Jack: sauvin, But coat pocket, I could do, but since I ride a motocycle, my backpack'll do, just not NEARLY as clunky.
03:22  tokam: BCMM: for ntp yes but not for ntpd
03:22  syn-ack: BCMM, jitter, on the internet includes latency.
03:22  tokam: debian 5
03:22  Psi-Jack: Now, I wonder if Skype works well on here. heheh
03:23  sauvin: I got it in case I felt like running off to Mickey D for a bite while I'm thinking, but then stuffed it into a drawer because of its keyboard. I'm thinking I want to rethink that approach. :D It's a pretty cool little toy.
03:23  syn-ack: sauvin, that's a very valid point. I just use the nist pool anyway on my ntpd here.
03:23  BCMM: tokam: that's not a bad config. i'd use something more like this http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/europe
03:24  BCMM: syn-ack: i thought jitter was the unpredictable variation in latency?
03:24  Psi-Jack: sauvin: I really don't yet know what I plan for it all, but I know this, this jewel I can take with me more comfortably than my laptop, and use it.
03:24  tokam: ok
03:24  Psi-Jack: With my magnitude of servers at home, I like to have them easily reachable. ;)
03:25  syn-ack: BCMM, When it comes to signal latency over the air it is.
03:25  tokam: so how to sync now if I have the ntp.conf written?
03:26  tokam: I copied the init script form the link but the system time did not change :(
03:26  syn-ack: like when you're picking it over the WWWB signal...
03:26  BCMM: tokam: do you know what an init script is?
03:26  tokam: :D
03:26  tokam: /etc/init.d/scrtipt start
03:26  BCMM: well, you should have one for ntpd. use that to restart it
03:27  BCMM: do not run it manually other than for debugging
03:28  tokam: http://www.akadia.com/services/ntp_synchronize.html here in the middle of the page is something
03:28  zymurgyz: Yea, typing on a netbook is definitely "different"
03:28  zymurgyz: It's a pita!
03:29  zymurgyz: Psi-Jack, how did you get fast graphics?
03:29  BCMM: netbooks are always just slightly too small for your hands
03:29  Psi-Jack: It's an Intel.
03:30  Psi-Jack: Heck even Compiz works really well with it.
03:30  BCMM: i probably type about as fast on an n900 as on an eeepc...
03:30  Psi-Jack: mic input, on the other hand, isn't working at all it seems.
03:31  zymurgyz: I'm stuck at with Mesa GL, which blows.
03:31  tokam: if I type in ntpd my time displayed using date does not change
03:32  BCMM: tokam: you might have it configured to not make sudden changes
03:32  jon_athon: if I do ps -eo pid, gid, uid, cmd and it shows a GID and UID as 0,0 am I correct in thinking that it is a process running as root?
03:33  BCMM: you can tell it whether to fix large problems instantly, or fix them over time by slowing or speeding the clock

03:34  jon_athon: syn-ack, thanks... fin
03:34  syn-ack: zymurgyz, Are you the same one from #linuxhelp on undernet?
03:34  zymurgyz: syn-ack, I'm Sauvin.
03:36  syn-ack: jon_athon, It's actually a pun. one for the TCP/IP handshake and "cynic"
03:36  MrElendig: jimisrvrox: samba? nx? ssh + vlc?
03:36  tokam: I am so tired I must do this tomorrow
03:36  tokam: ty for help.
03:36  jon_athon: syn-ack, oh, I dunno what cynic is... but I am familiar with tcp/ip
03:36  tokam: gn8
03:37  jimisrvrox: ssh works fine..X initialization failed...tried it..
03:37  syn-ack:  jon_athon You don't what a cynic is?
03:37  jimisrvrox: I figure it would be easier just to troubleshoot the ssh since Im already able to ssh into the box
03:37  jon_athon: syn-ack, I know what A cynic is... like being cynical
03:38  syn-ack: right. so say my nick really quick.
03:38  jon_athon: syn-ack, I thought you were talking about something else though... everytime I think I have the world figure out I turn around and another hip-hop r/b or rap artist has turned a normal word into a name
03:38  zymurgyz: Which @#$@# netbook do you suppose I have...?
03:38  syn-ack: hah, I'm none of the above.
03:39  jon_athon: check
03:39  syn-ack: I've had this nick for well over a decade. ;)
03:39  jon_athon: ah, O.G.
03:40  jon_athon: how do I view a list of which GID are associated with what group?
03:41  BCMM: /etc/group
03:42  jon_athon: BCMM, thanks I just found it... I guess I should read further first...
03:43  Raydiation: why is performance so bad when i cp files onto my ssd?
03:43  Raydiation: from an hd
03:44  Sabat: This is a tad offtopic, but I figured maybe someone here would remember the word. old bios chips, like pre-386, had a clear window on the top that was usualyl covered by a sticker to keep is from the light., and were written by some kinda light machine or something. I'm trying to remember what those were called. it was like 'burn' or 'light' or something, not 'flash' like they are now.
03:45  extor: I see in my knoppix livecd bootup params that the live filesystem size is set at ramdisk_size=100000 and I was wondering how many megs that actually is and if the 100000 is megabits of ram or kilobits of ram or what? I was thinking of making it larger
03:45  extor: Sabat, EEPROM? reprogrammable flashroms?
03:45  Sabat: I just had to reset the bios on a pc, and in the middle of doing it I remembered those old chips, but the word is on the tip of my tongue but I am just not remembering...
03:46  Sabat: eeprom is static changable
03:47  Sabat: using electricity, these were like, written by light.
03:47  extor: erased by light not written by light
03:47  Sabat: that's why they had the clear window with the sticker over it
03:47  gordboy: extor: i think it's just eprom. they are erased by uv light iirc
03:47  extor: the sticker was just to prevent erasure
03:47  Sabat: ya
03:47  extor: gordboy, yeah I dont think they were ever written to by light, just erased by UV light
03:48  Sabat: ok, that must be it then
03:48  stinky: timur: you should have some messages in your error logs pertaining to what happens
03:48  stinky: mistell
03:49  Sabat: I thought there was a inckname like fire, light,burn, sun... some hot or bright or something kinda ward. could just be a brain fart tho
03:49  Sabat: oh well, ty anyways, I think eeprom might have been it.
03:50  gordboy: i hate to join the chorus of justin bieber detractors. but he simply isn't in the same league as true talent like valentina lisitsa
03:51  FriedTomato: whats the best way to port an existing WIN32 application to Linux? Just write it for XWindows?
03:52  gordboy: haha. good luck

03:52  stinky: <<
03:52  zymurgyz: @#$@%@#$@#
03:53  Hiro2: whats the command to whisper to someone in irc?
03:53  Obvious: FriedTomato, winelib would be easiest
03:53  zymurgyz: Hiro2, /msg
03:53  numberz: you mean /msg
03:53  Hiro2: awesome, thank you
03:53  BCMM: FriedTomato: depends on a lot of stuff, not least you definition of "best"
03:53  gordboy: FriedTomato: the only practical way is to take something like qt or gtk+ which exists in both worlds
03:53  Hiro2: "* /msg: insufficient parameters" ??
03:53  Obvious: and this ^^^ is best, but longest
03:54  FriedTomato: let me explain, i dont need anything but window creation and ogl creation
03:54  FriedTomato: so i dont need to use a gui toolkit
03:54  FriedTomato: all i need is a window, and a way to get input
03:54  Obvious: FriedTomato, libSDL?
03:54  FriedTomato: no i dont use that anymore
03:54  FriedTomato: should i just look how they do it you mean?
03:55  Obvious: i mean use libSDL
03:55  Obvious: why not?
03:55  FriedTomato: its not async threaded for input/video
03:55  FriedTomato: has bugs
03:55  gordboy: FriedTomato: you could do mesa gl in an x window. kinda like this - http://xspect3d.sourceforge.net/
03:55  FriedTomato: i just want to know the most compatible way to display a window i guess, and im assuming its just write some xwindows code
03:56  FriedTomato: and then create ogl context somehow
03:59  BCMM: FriedTomato: so your app uses opengl for pretty much everything?
04:00  BCMM: FriedTomato: no one writes x11 code themselves these days. the sdl library is probably the simplest way to get an ogl context
04:00  gordboy: oh yes they do
04:00 * zymurgyz is making a valiant effort to get accelerated graphics on his netbook but can't seem to quit hitting the goddamn touchpad! 
04:00  FriedTomato: it probably is the simplest i agree, but i cant use it anymore, so its out
04:00  vandemar: sdl or qt
04:01  BCMM: gordboy: i exagerate only slightly
04:01  gordboy: FriedTomato: the basic sheme for gl in an x window - http://paste.linuxassist.net/215495
04:01  FriedTomato: and yeah, there is no OS specific stuff in the win32 version, just everything in opengl

04:03  dspDrew: what command shows all my drives
04:03  ananke: dspDrew: lsscsi
04:03  dspDrew: what's the other one
04:03  ananke: you tell me
04:03  BCMM: dspDrew: do you need to know about ones that aren't currently mounted?
04:03  stinky: fdisk -l
04:03  gordboy: FriedTomato: er no, that is part of it tho
04:03  stinky: dspDrew: ^
04:03  dspDrew: someone gave me a different one earlier
04:03  BCMM: dspDrew: you could just do df -h
04:03  BCMM: or mount
04:04  dspDrew: that just shows volumes
04:04  ananke: dspDrew: what's wrong with 'lsscsi'?
04:04 * kehcho dice buenas noches a todos... nos vemos :)
04:04  ananke: what are 'volumes'?
04:04  dspDrew: cause I just wanted the exact command I used earlier
04:04  BCMM: dspDrew: was it lshw-based?
04:04  dspDrew: I don't know
04:04  stinky: ananke: it doesn't come pre-installed on a good deal of distros
04:04  BCMM: dspDrew: do you log irc?
04:04  dspDrew: nope
04:04  ananke: stinky: debian doesn't count
04:04  dspDrew: the command was 5 letters
04:04  dspDrew: I know that much
04:04  ananke: dspDrew: look through your ~/.bash_history
04:04  stinky: ananke: ?
04:04  dspDrew: I think it had a g in it
04:05  stinky: ananke: i don't use debian
04:05  ananke: stinky: what distros do not come with it?
04:05  dspDrew: I was on a live cd
04:05  stinky: ananke: arch linux for one
04:05  ananke: stinky: niche distro. moving on
04:05  BCMM: gentoo
04:05  BCMM: any distro that is minimal by default
04:06  dspDrew: lsscsi doesnt work on this live cd
04:06  ananke: yet another reason why gentoo loses points
04:06  dspDrew: I just need to see all my storage devices
04:06  ananke: dspDrew: define 'doesn't work'
04:06  dspDrew: it's not there
04:06  BCMM: am i correct in saying that arch also tries to ship with very little?
04:06  ananke: dspDrew: that's different from 'doesn't work'.
04:06  dspDrew: cool
04:07  BCMM: dspDrew: i would use lshw
04:07  gordboy: blkid may be what you need
04:07  ananke: 'my boat doesn't work'. what's wrong with it? 'ohh, it doesn't exist'
04:07  dspDrew: for me right now if it's not there it's not working for me
04:07  stinky: BCMM: it does, though I try to give a solution that would apply to any distro in most situations, and fdisk does
04:08 * yagoo thinks dspDrew has no problem. It's a test bot. 
04:08  dspDrew: anybody know of any other command that will list my storage devices
04:08  yagoo: I don't even think dspDrew is addressing anyone.
04:08  ananke: parsing through fdisk is such a pita. it's like using a hammer instead of a screwdriver
04:08  BCMM: didn't know fdisk could list disks, useful
04:08  gordboy: dspDrew: blkid
04:08  dspDrew: thank you tht was it
04:09  stinky: ananke: i disagree
04:09  gordboy: no g in that tho
04:09  dspDrew: yeah
04:09  FriedTomato: gordboy: you are a programmer?
04:09  ananke: stinky: you may disagree all you want, doesn't change the fact that parsing through fdisk's output is a pain
04:09  dspDrew: your right about that
04:09  gordboy: FriedTomato: yes i am. i wrote the code you were looking at
04:10  stinky: ananke: i don't think it is. you do know you can pipe through grep in linux right?
04:10  ananke: stinky: that's genius. now go grep me names of devices and their corresponding brands/models
04:10  gordboy: FriedTomato: where it gets hairy, is event processing and threads
04:11  gordboy: which is why most people use toolkits
04:11  Giant81: anyone else having problems getting to http://www.gnu.org?
04:11  ananke: stinky: it's similar to people trying to parse output of ls, instead of using tools which produce much better formatted output

04:12  sauvin: Looks like I'm going to be installing a newer Ubuntu on the netbook. Tried to fix graphics and it royally screwed something up.
04:12  sauvin: GRR.
04:12  Giant81: oh yes, ty ananke
04:12  BCMM: FriedTomato: sdl is said to be a pretty good choice for cross-platform opengl programming, though i haven't tried it myself
04:12  stinky: ananke: i need the brands/models why?
04:12  BCMM: it works on everything
04:13  stinky: ananke: he didn't say he needed them either
04:13  MrElendig: BCMM: it also have some really iritating bugs, and not that great performance
04:13  ananke: stinky: to match the storage devices
04:13  FriedTomato: bcmm: yeah its good for basic programs, dont get me wrong
04:13  BCMM: even an ipod classic...
04:13  stinky: blkid ?
04:13  ananke: stinky: sure, if you have a single drive, then it's not an issue. then again, if you have a single device, you have no need to 'find' it
04:14  BCMM: MrElendig: i'm curious, poor performance when doing what?
04:14  sauvin: Psi-Jack, did you say you had trouble with the netbook remix?
04:14  BCMM: surely it doesn't impose overhead on opengl operations?
04:14  b0nn: sauvin: I do, unity has disappeared
04:15  sauvin: Wtf is "unity"?
04:15  gordboy: oneness of being
04:15  FriedTomato: gordboy: you make money programming linux apps?
04:15  ananke: sauvin: http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2010/10/25/ubuntu-to-move-to-unity-as-default-desktop-for-11-04/
04:15  ananke: some new shell for gnome
04:16  sauvin: I'm a KDE man.
04:16  reisio: symlinks rule
04:16  gordboy: FriedTomato: not really, i fix and maintain machines. but it's a nice hobby, keeps the brain from emulsifying
04:16  reisio: sauvin: I knew once, the other day
04:16  b0nn: KDE is getting its version of unity too
04:16  reisio: oh right
04:16  reisio: sauvin: it's a theme/config for GNOME's next revision with the desktop things
04:16  FriedTomato: indeed
04:16  ananke: b0nn: do you happen to know its name?
04:16  seanjohn: im slightly confused as to raid on linux. Do we create partitions on the drives and then array the partitions or, like the raid I know, do we array all the disks and THEN create the partitions?
04:16  reisio: that Ubuntu made/is making
04:16  b0nn: ananke: not off the top
04:16  ananke: seanjohn: either.
04:17  BCMM: what is unity? a sorta netbook interface?

16:15  crocket: does anybody know if SATA2 supports hotswap even if SATA power cable doesn't seem to have staggered pins?
16:16  crocket: Without staggered pins on both power cable and device, the device could fry.

16:23  DLange: ask the provider
16:23  DLange: tokam: did you edit /etc/hostname ?
16:24  tokam: yes I did.
16:25  tokam: before the server restarted I had mail.bitskoweb.de as hostname now I am not sure what's my hostname, because the shell and logfiles display something else
16:25  DLange: if in doubt, trust hostname :-)
16:26  DLange: perhaps there is some scripted magic to your PS1 prompt or so. Try asking in your distribution's channel. Maybe a known issue.
16:26  tokam: ok thx
16:28  PingFloyd: crocket: you pretty much answered your own question
16:28  PingFloyd: I sure wouldn't risk hotswapping if all connection don't have staggered pins
16:28  crocket: PingFloyd : electrical shocks need to be prevented according to SATA1 specification, but I don't know about SATA2 and SATA3.
16:28  PingFloyd: afterall, that is what prevent possible frying
16:29  PingFloyd: staggered pins are pretty simple, they have the ground wireds make contact before anything else
16:29  PingFloyd: that makes sure if there is a differential in charge, there it is discharged
16:29  PingFloyd: I can't imagine other specs not needing it
16:30  PingFloyd: to truly be hot swap safe
16:30  PingFloyd: of course plenty of designs out there defeat hot swapping by designing hardware with staggered pins
16:30  PingFloyd: *without
16:31  PingFloyd: Personally, I think it is silly when they do that, even if you're not going to be hotswapping
16:35  PingFloyd: when standard supports hotplugging all it means is that it won't hang when you hot swap, doesn't really say anything about the specs of the hardware involved.  You can pretty much always assume you need to make sure all involved hardware supports hotplugging specs.
16:37  crocket: PingFloyd, how can I know SATA power cable has 2 staggered pins? "https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Hardware_issues" says "In fact, it is quite hard to find a hotplug-compatible SATA power receptacle. On the first sight, the difference is subtle"

16:43  ananke: paul424: why would you care about the 'out of the box'? most distros have tons of languages available in their repositories
16:43  PingFloyd: crocket: that you can go ahead and not worry about the power cable being hotplugging compliant and go ahead and hotplug it anyway?
16:43  windowshasyou: Bartzy: It cleans out stale junk and makes sure everything is as it should be.
16:43  crocket: PingFloyd, Do you know where to find hotswap-capable SATA power cable?
16:44  PingFloyd: you can do that if you want, but there is a reason for things like staggered pins

18:08  ggt: ananke:As I wrote I've tried that, but it won't give me full path either
18:09  ggt: ananke:just the path from current working directory
18:09  dwhite: Pinchiukas, you might try: cd /dev; ./MAKEDEV std
18:09  ananke: ggt: you're not asking for the right thing then. 'full path' is what find gives you, but it's relative. you want _absolute_ path
18:09  ggt: ananke:yes, exactly
18:10  ggt: ananke:is it possible?
18:10  Pinchiukas: dwhite: ok.
18:10  Pinchiukas: Bah, no MAKEDEV. This is a Slackware 9.0 install cd. :)
18:11  ananke: ggt: no clue
18:11  ananke: Pinchiukas: simply use /dev/zero

18:12  PingFloyd: overwriting with random crap is a waste of time
18:12  Pinchiukas: Is it?
18:12  PingFloyd: yes
18:12  PingFloyd: read Craig Wright's paper
18:12  dwhite: Pinchiukas, although that's going to take a very long time if you're trying to overwrite a drive, unless you have a fast entropy source.
18:13  ananke: just zero it out, and be done with it
18:13  Pinchiukas: Is generating random numbers a slow task? :/
18:13  ananke: Pinchiukas: yes, very much so
18:13  PingFloyd: Pinchiukas: http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/security-corner/the-great-drive-wiping-controversy-settled-at-last/
18:13  dwhite: Pinchiukas, see that manpage for urandom
18:13  Pinchiukas: Even slower than a hard drive is? :)
18:13  dwhite: 'see the'
18:13  ananke: Pinchiukas: much slower
18:13  Pinchiukas: Doesn't sound right. ;/
18:14  PingFloyd: anyway, long story short, Craig Wright proves that Gutman is a loon, like we all suspected, and that Gutman leaves out a very important variable in his research
18:14  ananke: Pinchiukas: seems you haven't done your research
18:14  dwhite: Pinchiukas, i'd expect it to take several weeks to overwrite a drive with /dev/urandom
18:14  ggt: hm, finding it very weird that there is not simple command to output absolute path of files. Why is that?
18:14  dwhite: Pinchiukas, /dev/random would be much faster.
18:15  Pinchiukas: dwhite: doesn't /dev/random take something as an entropy source or something?
18:15  PingFloyd: even if you use non-blocking rng like urandom, it will take forever, now if you use a more reliable blocking RNG, then it will take centuries
18:15  PingFloyd: not literally
18:15  dwhite: Pinchiukas, see the manpage
18:15  PingFloyd: but it will take a really really long time
18:15  Pinchiukas: Ok.
18:15  dwhite: i think i have /dev/random and /dev/urandom backwards
18:16  dwhite: urandom should be much quicker, but less 'random'
18:16  PingFloyd: yes
18:16  PingFloyd: urandom is non-blocking, but it sacrifices some entropy as a result
18:17  gordboy: PingFloyd: you can sometimes recover written-over stuff by varying the speed, direction and field strength of the heads. the idea is that some magnetic domains remain underneath the surface. this requires many, many passes and a shedload of correlating hardware, or a convenient supercomputer
18:17  PingFloyd: gordboy: yeah, and maybe if real lucky, will recover a whole byte of useful data
18:18  ananke: yet nobody is doing this on a commmercial scale
18:18  PingFloyd: the thing of it is, gutman didn't take into account the probability of recovering even a single useful byte
18:18  gordboy: no. it costs too much
18:18  ggt: ah welll
18:18  PingFloyd: and a single useful byte, is pretty useless anyway
18:18  PingFloyd: hey look at me! I recovered the letter A
18:19  ananke: gordboy: there hasn't been any record of anybody recovering significant amount of data
18:19  Pinchiukas: Good for you! :)
18:19  PingFloyd: anyway, don't take my word for it, read Craig Wright's paper and comments instead
18:19  gordboy: the answer was readlink -f, btw
18:20  gordboy: ananke: if you had a secret capability, would you tell anyone ?
18:21  gordboy: first rule of secret information gathering : never, ever divulge your sources or methods
18:21  Pinchiukas: The article talks about the numbers of passes, how about the data I write to the drive?
18:21  Pinchiukas: Are zeroes good enough?
18:22  ananke: gordboy: forget the conspiracy theories. such technology would be very profitable.
18:23  ananke: Pinchiukas: a single pass of zeros is going to suffice virtually anybody. beyond that, physical destruction of media is more effective
18:23  Pinchiukas: Define virtually anybody.
18:24  gordboy: ananke: very profitable indeed
18:26  gordboy: i think the line from the gutman article, says it all - By deliberately under-stating the requirements for media sanitization in publicly-available guides, intelligence agencies can preserve their information-gathering capabilities while at the same time protecting their own data using classified techniques
18:28  PingFloyd: just pull out your platters and cut them into ninja throwing stars.  Then its not a total loss.
18:28  gordboy: haha
18:29  PingFloyd: though it kind of brings a new level into forensics if you happen to kill someone with those throwing stars
18:30  PingFloyd: throwing stars with residual personal data might not be such a great idea afterall

18:31  phormUlate: anybody have a fix for alsa/oss ess 1371 and no sound?
18:31  phormUlate: I've tried every distro imaginable
18:32  gordboy: PingFloyd: see, i don't care one way or the other about the great data-wiping debate. there is absolutely nothing i need to erase. but i'm sure people have been working on this for a very long time. and their results aren't going to be published any time soon
18:33  PingFloyd: anyway, the thing about sitting on secrets is the big wildcard to the whole thing.  Wright brought up some pretty good points, but neither paper really takes into account agendas.

18:33  faustisch: how do I work around this?
18:33  PingFloyd: that's the big unknown about it all
18:34  faustisch: /etc/fstab is empty because it's a livecd iso image
18:34  PingFloyd: same thing with encryption
18:34  PingFloyd: there may be people who have discovered some holes but aren't sharing the info
18:35  Pinchiukas: gordboy: nothing you need to erase? You have no passwords on your drives?
18:35  rockhopper: Hi, Will this ssh tunel work.  ssh user@server -L lanip:8888:localhost:3128
18:36  PingFloyd: Pinchiukas: the bottom line, if you're worried about it, melt the platters
18:36  gordboy: Pinchiukas: none in plaintext
18:36  faustisch: rockhopper, ssh -oTCPKeepAlive=no -oServerAliveInterval=8 -p[port] -C -D [local_port] -l [userid] 64.16.193.80

18:38  Giant81: cut up floppies?
18:38  Giant81: why not just melt them
18:38  phormUlate: kidding, i knew.... just distracting myself from this evil case of bacterial conjuncivitis some jerkoff gave me
18:39  phormUlate: i can barely look at the screen
18:39  phormUlate: ugh
18:39  stuckey: hi all
18:39  PingFloyd: he hid a pair of scissors on himself, and when they showed him they floppy he left behind by accident, he grabbed it and cut it up real quick
18:39  nightcracker: I have a problem with SSH to ubuntu server, I try to CD to /home/tukui it say's "cd : can't cd to tukui"

18:40  phormUlate: ;)
18:40  PingFloyd: this was back in the 80s or so
18:40  nightcracker: @Giant81 it is a folder
18:40  phormUlate: so ram was uber expensive
18:40  Giant81: see anymore, they'd get your e-mail from your ISP
18:40  phormUlate: heh
18:41  nightcracker: @Giant81 it is a webserver, with virtual servers in it and tukui home folder is one of the public_html folders
18:41  phormUlate: not if you use say, tor
18:41  Giant81: if they can associate your account with you, it doesn't matter how you got your e-mail transfered, the ISP probably has a copy
18:42  phormUlate: proxy chains!
18:43  Giant81: lol might help them track your account to you, but if they have your laptop and know your account name
18:44  phormUlate: that is why I use a tin can with string to communicate my important secrets
18:45  PingFloyd: what if I bug your tin cans?

19:01  windowshasyou: PingFloyd: yeah.
19:01  sedulous: http://www.nero.com/enu/linux4.html
19:01  windowshasyou: 4.0.0.1 is the latest I know of
19:02  sedulous: it actually looks better than the windows version which is quite bloated and not the most stable nowadays, from what i've heard
19:03  CerebralPimp: who can assist resolving a java "NoClassDef" error
19:03  windowshasyou: sedulous: cheaper than the winblows version too... like 20 usd for linux version vs... what? 80 for the winblows?
19:03  sedulous: windowshasyou: it's on sale for $9.99 right now
19:04  windowshasyou: hmmm might have to buy a serial then
19:05  ilab_: What does Nero have that free software burning apps don't?
19:06  ilab_: It's just cheaper because they know ppl. using linux have quality free software alternatives unlike windoze
19:06  windowshasyou: ilab_: IMO, nothing really, but in an effort to help get corps interested in developing for linux, I occasionally buy stuff like that.

19:12  PingFloyd: The Apple world had the attitude that games didn't matter, but the PC world had tons.  Apple almost went under from that attitude.
19:13  sauvin: They didn't listen to people, in other words.
19:13  PingFloyd: sauvin: apple had its own cult
19:14  PingFloyd: sauvin: apple said games where evil and it's users said games were evil because apples said so.
19:14  ilab_: I'm not saying linux should be closed off. Just that you shoudn't ty to signifcicantly transofmr it into something its not. Windoze has a history of support and frameworks developed that make it superior for games (e.g. DirectX).
19:14  sauvin: Now, here's the nice thing about linux in its present state: if somebody tries to make a Game OS out of it, somebody else will revolt and say "FORK THIS!"
19:14  PingFloyd: then apple asks its users what they want.
19:14 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 127 seconds
19:14  Giant81: more game manufactures are starting to realize MAC's influence in the world now
19:14  PingFloyd: they say, "anything but games Papa Jobs"
19:14  Giant81: STEAM has a MAC client
19:14  Giant81: EVEonline has a MAC client
19:14  lautriv_: wut ?
19:14  Giant81: I suspect you'll start to see more and more MAC games
19:15  ananke: ilab_: you know, using such stupid terms as 'windoze' only takes away from your argument
19:15  sauvin: ilab_, actually, for quite a while, if you wanted productivity, you used Windows; if you wanted to play games, you kept a DOS machine around. It took a while for games developers to get into the Windows way of doing things, and it took Windows quite a while to meet them halfway.
19:15  dwhite: since we're on th topic of apple. is anyone aware of an iphone emulator for linux (for it's IMAP client)?
19:15  sauvin: Giant81, I also suspect we'll be seeing more Linux games.
19:15  PingFloyd: yeah, win 3.11 had hardly any games
19:16  PingFloyd: and it even took quite awhile before devs were releasing w95 games
19:16  sauvin: Oh, heh, PingFloyd, Windows 3.11 wasn't such a problem. Windows NT *was*.
19:16  PingFloyd: microsoft pretty much had to kill dos, like they did, to get games on windows
19:16  Giant81: sauvin, though I suspect that's more of a symptom of seeing more MAC games, as I'd suspect a port from MAC to linux to be easier than a port from windows to Linux
19:16  lautriv_: and directX is absolutely no reason but the broad masses was.
19:16  PingFloyd: sauvin: there wasn't but a handful of win 3.11 games though
19:16  PingFloyd: sauvin: they were all almost all dos games
19:17  PingFloyd: it wasn't even really until shortly before win98's release that we saw windows games
19:17  ilab_: All i'm saying is you should use the right tool for the job. Use windows when you want to play mainstrream games, and when you want to have access to free software and excellent programming tools use linux. It doesn'
19:17  sauvin: PingFloyd, but you could play DOS games on it, you simply had to give up using the machine for anything *else* while playing a game :D
19:17  Giant81: you didn't see alot of games shift to 'windows' games until 98SE/2000
19:17  PingFloyd: also, many of the "win95" games were actually dos games that were win95 friendly
19:17  thedonvaughn: isn't DirectX 11 coming to linux anyway?
19:17  Giant81: but like you said, they had to pretty much kill DOS to get it
19:18  sauvin: Not sure how I feel  about that... I actually liked DOS.
19:18  Pinchiukas: Can I write a CD from some distros install CD environment or does that require a shipload of software?
19:18  PingFloyd: sauvin: well yeah, but that's because win 3.11 was mostly just a dos shell and
19:18  Giant81: I've hard rumor that Ubuntu is claiming it will be a fully functional windows gaming platform by end of 2011
19:18  sauvin: PingFloyd, yup!
19:18  Giant81: s/hard/heard/
19:19  lautriv_: Pinchiukas, you need just a few packages  and those are mostly default.
19:19  PingFloyd: sauvin: I think they should've kept it that way and improved dos
19:19  SpiceMan: Giant81: don't pay attention to rumours about software claiming anything :p
19:19  Pinchiukas: lautriv_: which ones?
19:19  Giant81: SpiceMan, it was from my Linux professor, but yeah, as much as I'd love to see it, I don't think it will happen
19:20  sauvin: In retrospect, why? They'd have just wound up with a multiuser multitasking DOS with a graphical front end... O:)
19:20  lautriv_: Pinchiukas, cdrecord or it'S fork wodim and maye mkisofs, if you will doin a gui you may consider brasero fro gnome or k3b for kde.
19:20  Giant81: though I've heard of people getting better preformance on certain games like WoW under Ubuntu than widows
19:20  SpiceMan: Giant81: tell your professor that ubuntu is a distribution. ie: software. ie: doesn't speak.
19:20  sauvin: I can speak for brasero! Saved my butt last night!
19:20  lautriv_: Giant81, WoW is net-based and regarding this part win sucks always.
19:21  SpiceMan: PingFloyd: and there was no way to improve DOS
19:21  SpiceMan: hence they ditched it.
19:21  Pinchiukas: lautriv_: I don't think k3b is standard for install CDs. :)
19:21  sauvin: "no way to improve DOS"?
19:22  lautriv_: Giant81, depends on distro, like i said "most of"
19:22  lautriv_: Pinchiukas, , depends on distro, like i said "most of"
19:22  Giant81: lautriv_, so the difference in networking stacks between windows and linux make a difference in FPS more than having to run the graphics on Linux instead of windows?
19:22  lautriv_: Giant81, bad tabbing :-)
19:22  SpiceMan: sauvin: it was a piece of crap. the only way to "improve" it is write it from scratch (winnt? :p)
19:22  Pinchiukas: lautriv_: show me a distro that has k3b on its install CD. :)
19:22  Giant81: hehe, been there done that
19:22  SpiceMan: s/is/was/
19:23  ilab_: Pinchiukas: fedora does i think
19:23  lautriv_: Giant81, nah, the FPS may be the underlying structure but if you do net-related stuff linux is always faster.
19:23  Giant81: on the topic of cdrecord and k3b, any burning software for linux able to burn to multiple drives at once?
19:24  SpiceMan: Giant81: quakeliv has steadier FPS in linux than windows. then again ID software always was linux friendly
19:24  PingFloyd: SpiceMan: that's nonsense
19:24  lautriv_: Giant81, not at once but a bunch of in order.
19:24  Cap_J_L_Picard: M$ took a rather good networking stack and once they worked it over I expect they didn't want to use it again....
19:24  Cap_J_L_Picard: but the boss says they have to.
19:25  Giant81: quake was openGL though, DirectX games are the worry
19:25  Giant81: we need more OpenGL games, let DirectX die
19:25  SpiceMan: PingFloyd: pretty much any program could do anything it wanted with memory, interrupts, whatever. it was chaos.
19:25  Cap_J_L_Picard: DirectX is usefull for some things....
19:25  SpiceMan: PingFloyd: if you don't see that as a problem for an OS...
19:26  sauvin: SpiceMan, MS didn't rewrite DOS when they came up with NT-class Windows. The NT kernel was from a very different place.
19:26  Cap_J_L_Picard: Opengl was designed for single non realtime rendering, not the realtime rendering we have today.
19:26  Giant81: I've never have to program for it, so I cannot attest to it's usefulness, but it would be nice to have an API that worked on both linux and windows
19:26  SpiceMan: sauvin: I know, what I'm saying is that instead of rewriting DOS, making something new make more sense.
19:27  Cap_J_L_Picard: and the CAD application authors don't want to lose backwards compatibility so won't allow Nvidia and ATI to give it the good working over and update it needs.
19:27  Cap_J_L_Picard: Giant81: that is the bonus with opengl now.

19:34  Random832: no, he's saying SASL is a thing that actually exists, and it is. That's not the same as saying that the claim it will be required for freenode is true
19:34 @sauvin: Giant81, I believe you. The form and general content of the spam is something we've been seeing for months now, and is a major reason this channel now seems bound to requiring identification to services :\
19:34  intx: yet the topic of #freenode is, SSL is not mandatory to connect to freenode: http://blog.freenode.net/2010/11/be-safe-out-there/
19:34  dwhite: right, and i'd expect it to at least hit #cyrus, or other sasl based channels.
19:34  Cap_J_L_Picard: it would have been an obvious wall or wallop too in my client here.
19:34  mjbjr: Rdogg: choose better colors, it's not very readable
19:34  intx: SASL does actually exist
19:34  Cap_J_L_Picard: it's not mandatory but there is a bot claiming it is.
19:34  MrCoffee: Neither is SASL unless you connect through tor.
19:35  intx: but 13:28 < Cap_J_L_Picard> intx: it's christel and he/she is a freenode op.
19:35  Cap_J_L_Picard: but yes, it does exist, but only through tor.
19:35  intx: maybe i misunderstood?
19:35  Rdogg: mjbjr, like what
19:35 @sauvin: ATTENTION: YOU MAY CERTAINLY USE SASL TO CONNECT TO FREENODE IF YOU DESIRE. IT IS NOT MANDATORY.
19:35  Cap_J_L_Picard: intx: it's designed to imitate christel, on ove the freenode ops.
19:35  Random832: intx: or maybe he misunderstood
19:36  Cap_J_L_Picard: it looks like managed to get missed.
19:36  intx: yeah i think you're right Random832
19:36 @sauvin: Some of the nicks we see spewing this drivel are deliberately designed to resemble those of IRC ops :\
19:36  comawhite: it's those GNAA retards that does those bots, just a bunch of retarded losers with no lifes
19:36  mjbjr: Rdogg: maybe make the green brighter, or maybe make the bg color manilla
19:37  Cap_J_L_Picard: sauvin: why don't the block such attempts without the proper staff mask?
19:37 @sauvin: comawhite, yea, what the hell IS their deal?
19:37  comawhite: sauvin, it's a long story and a stupid one
19:37 @sauvin: Cap_J_L_Picard, why don't who block what, now?
19:37  Rdogg: mjbjr, refresh

19:37  Rdogg: :D
19:38  Cap_J_L_Picard: sauvin: the bots that try to imitate the ops nicks?
19:38  Random832: they'll just imitate it differently
19:38  Random832: you could go extra-conservatively and include 1, I, and L all in a single equivalence class
19:38  Random832: for nick collision
19:38  Cap_J_L_Picard: Random832: yeah, a little fuzzy matching...
19:39  Random832: but they'll just find another way
19:39  Rdogg: mjbjr, any more info i should add?
19:39 @sauvin: Cap_J_L_Picard, if I were to want to imitate Christel, I might log on with a nick like Christe1 or ChristeI.
19:39  Random832: i mean, are there really three o's in "rooolz" in the original nick?
19:40  PingFloyd: or Chr1st31
19:40 @sauvin: PingFloyd, yup, and "fuzzy matching" may wind up preventing too many legitimate users.
19:40  Giant81: Random832, yes
19:40  mjbjr: Rdogg: what's the 'Disk: ->' thingy hanging out there for?
19:41  Random832: you know
19:41  Giant81: Random832, or atleast i'm pretty sure
19:41  MrCoffee: There is.
19:41  Rdogg: mjbjr, what do you mean
19:41  Random832: imitating the IRC ops doesn't seem like it'd be very effective, since at least I have no idea who the IRC ops are - i mean, i see idoru in /kill messages but other than that
19:42  Giant81: hehe I didn't even realize Plazma was an op
19:42  lautriv_: Random832, and idouru is an anti-flood-bot.
19:42  Random832: see i didn't even know that
19:42  Random832: i'd bet the vast majority of users are ignorant as to who is or isn't an irc op
19:43  Cap_J_L_Picard: Random832: considering they act in the shadows most of the time, they should be.
19:44  mjbjr: Rdogg: using chromium the line 'Disk: ->' is to the right of the hd box, using firefox it's above the hd box... I was using chromium initially... in any case, I'd lose the '-->' part
19:44 @sauvin: Most users don't even know who the channel ops are; THEY're a sneaky bunch, too!
19:44  Rdogg: mjbjr, done

19:46  mjbjr: Rdogg: ok... so, why does chromium render it differently than ff?  could your code be better written so that there's no descrepancy between the two?
19:46  dwhite: from the slim documentation of freenode's SASL support, it seems to be pretty unrebust. I cannot find any claim of it using security layers, or supporting a sasl mechanim other than 'PLAIN', which transmits the password in the clear
19:47  dwhite: unrobust
19:47  [R]: dwhite: your supposed to use it over ssl
19:47  Rdogg: try now
19:47  nirad: Are theire any website where I can find Customer Reviews? On amazone there's only 1 comment. Need review for book Information Systems Development: Methods-in-Action
19:47  Random832: dwhite: you're sure PLAIN doesn't transmit it in the "clear" within an already encrypted session?
19:47  Rdogg: mjbjr, try now should be same in both
19:47  dwhite: [R], why. doesn't that default the purpose of using SASL?
19:47  mjbjr: Rdogg: much better
19:47  Yancho: hi. what is the cups apt=get install command pls? not anymore cupsys ?
19:47  Rdogg: mjbjr,  :D
19:47  [R]: dwhite: does it? theres a purpose? i thought its just so you could be authed to nickserv before you connect
19:47  danieldg: dwhite: SASL DH-BLOWFISH is actually less protected than SSL, so yes
19:47  [R]: dwhite: but it does support more than PLAIN
19:48  [R]: dwhite: look up the docs on the ircd... not freenode crap
19:48  Random832: wait... there's a way to auth to nickserv before you connect?
19:48  dwhite: The reason for sasl it is provides 1) a way to transmit a password without using an encrypted layer 2) Allows you to encrypt your session without SSL
19:48  Random832: why the heck doesn't RFC1459 PASS auth you to nickserv before connecting?
19:48  danieldg: dwhite: not true on (2)
19:48  Random832: [it lags so i end up in ##linux-overflow half the time]
19:48  MrCoffee: argos-void: I'm not sure what your intent is.  pkgtool works with packages; however, usbboot.img is not.
19:48  [R]: Random832: the pass does, but later than sasl does
19:48  Random832: that's dumb
19:48  [R]: Random832: with sasl, you wont connect UNTIL you're authed
19:48  dwhite: danieldg, sure it does. i can encrypt an imap session with SASL without ssl
19:48  Random832: why doesn't pass do the same thing?
19:49  danieldg: dwhite: IRC SASL does not
19:49  [R]: Random832: the PASS sends it after authentication wit hteh servert
19:49  dwhite: danieldg, than I need to be educated. What's the point?
19:49  [R]: i meant registration*
19:49  Random832: er, that's not how PASS works
19:49  [R]: Random832: sasl sends it during registration
19:49  mjbjr: Rdogg: can't really think of any thing else to add... except maybe... hd smart failure analysis info, which in the past has been deemed to not always be accurate, not sure how it's regarded these days
19:49  Random832: it has to be sent before at least one of NICK and USER, so it is by definition before/during registration
19:49  danieldg: dwhite: it only protects the password, doesn't protect it against MITM attacks
19:49  [R]: Random832: yes... but it does send ti to nickserv until after
19:49  danieldg: dwhite: otherwise, it's just an early PASS
19:49  Random832: why not?
19:50  [R]: Random832: ask the peopel who created the ircd
19:50  Rdogg: mjbjr, what command to check in linux?
19:50  danieldg: Random832: because the IRC registration process doesn't wait on services normally
19:50  dwhite: danieldg, so you're saying freenode sasl doen't not protect the password form MITM attack? I agree with that
19:50  mjbjr: Rdogg: see 'smartmontools'
19:50  danieldg: dwhite: yes, I'm saying that
19:50  Random832: danieldg: it should if i send a PASS
19:50  danieldg: Random832: it doesn't
19:50  dwhite: danieldg, how is that more secure than what I do today?
19:50  Random832: i mean, if it were an architectural limitation i could understand
19:50  Rdogg: mjbjr, k i installed it
19:50  danieldg: dwhite: it's not imo
19:50  Random832: but if SASL can do it why can't the normal one?
19:50  dwhite: k
19:51  [R]: Random832: theres a handshake procedure in the sasl commands
19:51  danieldg: Random832: it theoretically can
19:51  [R]: Random832: no such thing in irc
19:51  [R]: regular irc*
19:51  danieldg: it can, just nobody has done so in the ircds
19:51  MrPockets: what is the easiest way / protocol to impliment encryption for SMTP on Postfix?
19:52  MrPockets: SSL?, or is TLS less-involved for SMTP?
19:52  dwhite: MrPockets, easiest depends on your environment and your clients, but sasl/digest-md5 is probably easiest.
19:52  danieldg: TLS is SSL
19:53  mjbjr: Rdogg: also, you could add processor flags
19:53  Random832: danieldg: then why is TLS and SSL always two separate configuration options in clients?
19:53  thedonvaughn: MrPockets: TLS, and it's pretty easy to implement.  many tutorials online
19:54  danieldg: Random832: TLS is starting the SSL handshake a bit later than normal SSL does
19:54  danieldg: so you don't need a special SSL port
19:54  MrPockets: and if i'm trying to encrypt message data in "outgoing" (from the client, to the server) over SMTP, you'd impliment TLS in Postfix?

20:12  Random832: i think w3m has some CSS
20:13  Random832: [R]: how is it retarded? i mean, clearly it's reasonable for a console browser to support font color. how is the css 'color' property less reasonable for it to support than the <font color='blah'> tag?
20:13  [R]: lol
20:14  Random832: or text alignment, left right center justify - those have meaning in the console
20:14  Random832: list-style-type - 123 vs abc vs i ii iii
20:14  Random832: floating boxes with the css float property, and clear to control it
20:14  mjbjr: Rdogg: yeah, now do the whole thing in html5 using the 'canvas' to draw bars for the hd precentages    ;)
20:14  Random832: width even
20:15  Random832: though you'd have to figure out how many characters it is
20:15  nightwalk: Supposedly, firefox can be built to run on top of directfb rather than X. So yes, I guess you could say css is supported in a 'console' web browser :)
20:15  mjbjr: 'supposedly'
20:15  Rdogg: Lol
20:15  Random832: css actually has a media type "grid"
20:15  Rdogg: no need for html5

20:52  ananke: i'm fairly certain you have to use @gmail.com part
20:52  karthick87: PingFloyd: oke i will try that then
20:52  ilab_: fotange assuming you have a network card
20:52  ananke: karthick87: then you didn't follow the instructions
20:53  Mkman: Hey!
20:53  fotang: ilab: i can change my mac address :)
20:53  ananke: fotang: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
20:54  karthick87: ananke: SMTP settings for evolution is not there
20:54  ilab_: fotang: well you can't technically change your mac adddress. you can change the mac address on your OS layer, but if you use that argument then you can technically change any unique hardware identifier in how your OS presents it
20:54  ananke: karthick87: you just said you followed directions.
20:55  karthick87: ananke: Yes i followed the instructions which is given for thunderbird
20:55  sedulous: gravestone: i'm using Debian Testing on a laptop with 4500MHD graphics and it's been fine for many months
20:55  gravestone: Hm
20:55  PingFloyd: karthick87: yeah, but this is http://tuxicity.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/howto-set-up-gmail-in-evolution-gnomes-mail-client-and-organizer/
20:55  ananke: karthick87: all of those instructions say clearly to use @gmail.com address for smtp auth
20:56  fotang: ananke: we want to uniquely identify each PC that aome external personnel has taken out for field exercise
20:56  ananke: fotang: try this: dmidecode -s system-uuid
20:56  fotang: s/aome/some
20:56  gravestone: sedulous: thanks
20:56  ananke: fotang: additionally, dmidecode -s system-serial-number may be useful on machines from major vendors
20:57  fotang: ananke: that looks unique. thanx
20:57  fotang: ananke: that last one indeed gives the serial number of my thinkpad!
20:57  fotang: never knew that
20:58  fotang: wow
20:58  ananke: fotang: yeah, dell/hp/ibm/sony/etc - all of those can be used with that last option
20:58  ananke: fotang: overall, dmidecode is your friend :)
20:58  mattalexx: I have a linux box on my network that use as a web server. Usually, the domains of the development sites are something like "devsite.mattserver.com". Now, if I access that domain from anywhere outside of my network, it get routed to the server because I have set up port forwarding and all that. But when I access the site from within the network, I get the router config unless I put the specific domain in my hosts file. How can I chan
20:58  mattalexx: ge this?
20:59  [R]: mattalexx: its called NAT reflection
20:59  [R]: mattalexx: something you have to set up on the router
20:59  [R]: mattalexx: or if you have a dns server on your router, set it to resolve that to the internal ip
20:59  mattalexx: [R], I have "NAT State: Enabled/Disabled". Is that it?
21:00  [R]: mattalexx: no... tahts just nat
21:00  PingFloyd: karthick87: are you trying to use imap or pop3?
21:01  mattalexx: [R], Would it be called something else possibly?
21:01  [R]: mattalexx: if you have a consumer router... i dobut it has it
21:02  mattalexx: [R], http://i.imgur.com/sjpxS.png
21:03  [R]: yup
21:03  [R]: just like i said
21:03  [R]: [01:01:37] [R] mattalexx: if you have a consumer router... i dobut it has it
21:03  mattalexx: [R], I see. So I'm SOL?
21:03  mattalexx: hosts file forever?
21:03  [R]: get a decent router?
21:03  PingFloyd: what a terrible UI they give you
21:04  nightwalk: Or turn the current 'router' into a dumb media converter and use a linux system as a router ;)
21:04  nightwalk: Hmm...guess that qualifies as a more verbose form of 'get a decent router' though :/
21:06  nightwalk: Seriously though. I haven't found an embedded router yet that does the job well. They all have a tendency to flake out at the least opportune moments
21:07  [R]: my $20 piece of crap works just dandy... once i put real firmware on it
21:08  RDove: is there a lot of security risks in letting someone have a free shell account on your box?
21:08  [R]: RDove: of course
21:08  [R]: RDove: they can get root and own you
21:08  ananke: RDove: yes. rule of thumb: don't give away any accounts. ever.
21:09  nightwalk: [R]: By 'real firmware' you mean ddwrt or openwrt, right? Sorry, but my $20 piece of crap was still a $20 piece of crap with or without a different firmware :)
21:09  [R]: nightwalk: yeah... openwrt... i used to run dd though
21:09  [R]: nightwalk: if you plan on hosting 50 servers and having a milllion concurrnet connections
21:09  [R]: i could see how one would fail
21:09  RDove: what about free web hosting, enabling just an FTP with /sbin/nologin and a disk quota? is that pretty secure?
21:09  [R]: but if its just for a home
21:09  Wulf: RDove: ftp is not secure
21:09  [R]: RDove: ftp isn't secure... and they could STILL own you
21:09  sedulous: Wulf: why not?
21:10  Wulf: RDove: if you only serve static html files and similar, it might be okay
21:10  Wulf: sedulous: you can steal passwords and data connections. ftp sucks.
21:10  nightwalk: [R]: or have it doing ipvs....or having a decent sized routing table...or a decent amount of NAT connections.
21:11  verywiseman: i have application that need 8 processors , and i have 3 racks each of them have 2 , is it will be suitable to buy another one server with 2 cpu and run all of them as high-performance cluster (like beowulf cluster) rather than purchase 8 cores server?
21:11  [R]: nightwalk: ipvs?
21:11  ananke: RDove: what exactly are you trying to achieve?
21:11  nightwalk: You could argue the first two are somewhat advanced uses, but the last one is important to downloading torrents and such
21:11  [R]: verywiseman: well if you laready have the hardware...
21:11  [R]: nightwalk: i never have problems with torrents
21:12  RDove: ananke, i wanted to give out free web hosting to people
21:12  ananke: verywiseman: there is a big difference between need for multiple processors on a single machine, versus multiple machines
21:12  sedulous: Wulf: only if you allow unencrypted connections
21:12  ananke: RDove: word of advice, don't. there are plenty of such services already
21:13  nightwalk: [R]: yes. ipvs/lvs. Had openwrt (or was it ddwrt?) set up to handle some ipvs virtual services for me a few years ago. Predictably, it didn't work too well
21:13  ananke: verywiseman: does that software use threading/openmp, or mpi?
21:13  [R]: nightwalk: well that sounds advanced like you already said
21:14  RDove: anyone want to comment on proftpd vs vsftpd, which one you think is better?
21:14  ananke: RDove: both are good.
21:14  nightwalk: [R]: I've tried various generations of WRTs, netgears, etc. Only thing I've ever had that'd do torrents without freaking out every couple weeks or so was an Actiontec, and surprise, surprise...it's linux-based
21:14  verywiseman: ananke, i don't know
21:15  ananke: verywiseman: what's the name of that application?
21:15  [R]: nightwalk: weird... i've never had problems with torrents
21:15  [R]: nightwalk: and i've been using this router for years
21:15  verywiseman: ananke, any way thank you , i'll study these techs
21:15  verywiseman: ananke, also i don't know :), i don't care about app
21:16  ananke: verywiseman: uhmm, so when you said 'i have application that needs 8 processors', you were just making it up?
21:17  verywiseman: ananke, my company have this app , and we search about suitable solutions
21:17  nirad: What does zealots mean?
21:17  ananke: verywiseman: did your company make that app?
21:18  ananke: nirad: dictionary.com
21:21 --- denny_ is now known as denny
21:21  ananke: verywiseman: and how do you expect to search for a solution, if you don't even know the name of that application or what it uses?
21:21  ultralazer: a zealot is someone who is overpassionate and annoying in the way they interpret that which makes them passionate.
21:21  ultralazer: in case someone didn't know
21:21  bagira: most strange; xchat is identifying with nickserv after /joining channels, so i keep ending up in ##linux-overflow
21:21  nightwalk: verywiseman: might need to check into infiniband too. You'll probably need to use it as an interconnect if you expect a beowulf cluster to come anywhere near a single 8 core system, performance-wise
21:22  verywiseman: ananke, no,
21:22  ananke: looking into IB is jumping the gun, if you don't even know if your software can take advantage of separate machines
21:23  nightwalk: True, but that's for him/her to decide. Not me.
21:23  ananke: and investing in IB fabric + another 2 core machine is less than cost effective in comparison to simply getting an 8 core machine
21:24  nightwalk: Exactly so ;)
21:24  Rdogg: f**k yea got my dad to get me a new flash drive
21:25  nightwalk: Better to tell them that they might need ib, then let them go price things for themselves. They'll remember it better that way.
21:25  ananke: why not tell them they might altix uv?
21:27  nightwalk: Because *that* would be overkill :P
21:28  nightwalk: It's fair to assume you'd need ib if you're looking to make a HPC rather than HA cluster
21:28  kehcho: is it true that freenode will change the way to connect it?
21:29  ananke: IB is one of the many possible fabrics for HPC cluster. and all of that is jumping the gun on a problem that's not even clearly defined
21:29  nightwalk: Not fair to assume you'd need a supercomputer though
21:29  ananke: kehcho: no.
21:29  kehcho: ammm
21:29  kehcho: ok thanks
21:30  ananke: nightwalk: at this point you're assuming that he needs a cluster
21:30  nightwalk: ananke: Jumping the gun? Not really. Since this all seems to be theoretical at this point, I was simply giving the op something else to look into that may well become relevant
21:30  LinuxMafia: hi any good and strong video editor for flash videos?
21:31  lautriv_: LinuxMafia, flash is evil, nothing to edit.
21:32  nightwalk: ananke: no, the op said they were looking to make an HPC out of existing equipment rather than buying a new 8 core server. To get similar characteristics (though still probably inferior), they're likely to need ib
21:32  LinuxMafia: lautriv_, there should be something
21:32  ananke: nightwalk: and not myrinet, or 40GE? sending them on a wild goose chase is silly
21:33  nightwalk: The lesson I was trying to lead the op to was that their cheap route was more likely to be the expensive route in this case. There's a reason AMD & Intel keep producing chips with higher and higher core counts after all
21:34  verywiseman: nightwalk, ananke  now , what i need to meet app requirement is IB+2 core server ? any thing else?
21:34  Rdogg: guys
21:34  Rdogg: how do i use colors in bash?
21:35  ananke: verywiseman: based on the very limited requirement of '8 procs' you provided, the answer is: 'no'
21:35  nightwalk: verywiseman: you *may* need ib. Make sure you at least read my last message ;)
21:35  The_ManU_212: hi
21:35  ananke: verywiseman: what you should be doing is finding out details on what software you have, not what hardware you may need
21:36  lautriv_: nightwalk, i don't get the whole context but increasing core-count has other reasons than the expense of networking in clusters.
21:36  The_ManU_212: APC Back UPS ES 700, USV 700VA is this UPS compatible with linux (automatic shutdown/hibernate)?
21:36  nightwalk: verywiseman: since ananke seems hellbent on not letting me teach you my way, I'll just spell it out for you. HPC clusters will in all likelihood not get you to the price/performance point you want without investing a ton of money into it. Probably better to budget for an 8 core server if possible
21:37  ananke: i see no point in sending people down the wrong path, in sake of teaching them some kind of a 'lesson'
21:37  ananke: s/in/for the/
21:38  nightwalk: lautriv: no...the point was that higher core count allows one to do more on a single system, *without* the added expense of low latency interconnects. Same thing goes for CUDA & whatever Intel's is called
21:40  docmur: has anyone tried out that kernel patch that is spose to increae preformance by a ton
21:41  nightwalk: ananke: ah, but it isn't necessarily the 'wrong path'. Especially since verywiseman doesn't even seem to know exactly what s/he needs for sure
21:41  lautriv_: nightwalk, ok, then i should scroll back a hour before commenting :-)
21:41  verywiseman: nightwalk, i am he not she :)
21:42  ananke: nightwalk: then he may need uv100
21:42  bocaneri: verywiseman, gender on IRC is often masked, and for a reason :D
21:42  ananke: verywiseman: until you know the name of the software, safe assumption is that it requires SMP, and can't do MPI
21:42  verywiseman: nightwalk, ananke thank you , and i will get more info ,then i will back to you
21:43  nightwalk: ananke: anyway, I can accept that you don't like my teaching style. teaching styles are like a**holes after all. Everyone has their own, and almost no one likes anyone else's ;)
21:43  nightwalk: lautriv: welcome to my world :/
21:44  nightwalk: verywiseman: 's/he' is my way of being politically correct. It's not really any more fair to mistake a 'she' for a 'he' now, is it? :)
21:44  lautriv_: ananke, btw do you know similar boxen like the altix basing on opterons instead ?
21:44  ananke: lautriv_: nope. when it comes down to it, SGI has cornered that market
21:45  BarkingFish: Guys, I have a fairly urgent question.  I know it's possible to have a linux system fsck and repair a drive on reboot, before it mounts the system - I can't remember which command to use or how to do it, and I need it, urgently.
21:45  Rdogg: guys, how would i grep the disk usage percentage from df -h?
21:46 --- Muzer is now known as MuzerAway
21:46  lautriv_: BarkingFish, touch /forcefsck
21:46  ananke: BarkingFish: man page for 'shutdown' also shows you a switch
21:46  BarkingFish: My machine keeps crashing when it hits a particular sector on the disk, and I need to fsck it. The problem is it's the root partitiion that it's happening in :)
21:47  BarkingFish: cheers guys, I'll check both of those out now
21:47  nightwalk: lautriv_: No idea if they have such beasts in the wild yet, but I'd imagine a dual i7 system would be quite an experience ;)
21:47  BarkingFish: I gotta drop, it was this I was using last time when the disk died :)

21:48  Rdogg: not just 1
21:48  lautriv_: nightwalk, i prefer AMD for certain reasons.
21:48  sedulous: Rdogg: just the percentage wouldn't be very meaningful, no?
21:48  sedulous: (you probably need the mount point too)

22:04  Deafgoose_: hmm I c
22:04  bocaneri: Rdogg, can you mabe just get df output and chop it up in php itself?
22:05  Deafgoose_: so I should have to specify the location in the script I guess
22:05  Rdogg: with preg_match?
22:05  dwhite: Deafgoose_, if you can, yeah.
22:06  bocaneri: I don't know php from the dark side of the moon; I understand the code sorta kinda because the bash parts are clear enough and because the rest is similar to perl :\
22:06  Deafgoose_: alright dwhite I will try that, thanks for the tips
22:07  dwhite: Deafgoose_, and if your file is ending up in /root, it sounds like you're running the process under root's crontab. you might want to run it under the same user as your webserver to be safe.

22:38  Yahav: ananke: actually there are ways
22:38  ananke: Yahav: dd if=/dev/zero of=/somebigfile
22:38  nightwalk: /dev/urandom, and multiple runs is the only way to be sure
22:38  Yahav: its pretty much doesn't delete anything, just move them to some ulocated bytes
22:38  ananke: nightwalk: single wipe is sufficient
22:38 --- TomMan81 is now known as TomManAway
22:39  nightwalk: ananke: maybe...as long as you don't have g-men after you ;)
22:39  Yahav: ananke: i dont want to delete the whole paratition
22:39  marduk: yeah i would fill the fs with random bits
22:39  ananke: Yahav: then do what i told you
22:39  nightwalk: yahav: the dd command I sent is just something you use to fill a file on the mount with junk. it won't destroy *anything* but the deleted files if you do it write
22:39  ananke: nightwalk: that tired argument keeps being repeated, yet nobody has ever shown any proof of being able to recover any actual data.
22:39  Yahav: ananke:  the file already been deleted, thats the problem
22:40  nightwalk: err....right :/
22:40 --- centosian_ is now known as centosian
22:40  Yahav: nightwalk: ohhh
22:40  ananke: Yahav: and by filling up the remaining space on the filesystem you're wiping whatever was left
22:40  nightwalk: ananke: so disprove it yourself.
22:40  Yahav: so let me get this stright
22:40  nightwalk: where security is concerned, it's better to be safe than sorry
22:40  marduk: there was a link someone posted the other day
22:41  Yahav: if i would do: "dd if=/dev/zero of=/somebigfile"
22:41  ananke: nightwalk: i can just point to canonical papers from NIST
22:41  marduk: about somoene buying drives off of ebay and recovering deleted files and such
22:41  ananke: marduk: yes. and that data wasn't wiped.
22:41  Yahav: then nothing then the files i already deleted will be shreded?
22:42  marduk: huh?
22:42  nightwalk: yahav: /dev/zero would be faster, but /dev/urandom is a more secure 'if=' to use if you have the time & resources to dedicate to it
22:42  bocaneri: Finding lots of strange juicy porn, eh?
22:42  ananke: Yahav: you seem to be ignorning what you're told
22:42  marduk: oh nothing *but*?
22:42  lolcat: Yahav: Can't you just physicaly destroy the disk
22:43  Yahav: ananke: i'm sorry but can't keep focused, the channel is bloody over-active
22:43  marduk: lolcat: i think he wants the drive and the remaining files on it, just not the data from the deleted files
22:43  nightwalk: yahav: basically, if you use either /dev/zero or /dev/urandom, it's going to keep the average consumer from being able to get at the file contents. There are supposedly ways of recovering data that has only been zero'ed though.
22:43  Yahav: bocaneri: do you think i will even think of deleting my porn?!?! NO WAY
22:43  lolcat: marduk: If it really is confidential, I would destroy the disk and buy a new one.
22:44  marduk: lolcat: ok, but that's just not practical (or necessary)
22:44  bocaneri: Otherwise, just stash all your porn in encrypted directories :D
22:44  lolcat: marduk: If it is a disk with confidential information that people who shouldnt have acces to the information has access to, then it is necessary.
22:45  marduk: sigh
22:45  nightwalk: lolcat: many companies RMA disks that have confidential data on them. scary stuff, that :/
22:45  lolcat: RMA?
22:45  lolcat: I have nothing confidential on my disk, not even anything interessting
22:46  lolcat: And its encrypted, so i cant be bothered even to delete stuff
22:46  lolcat: Just add a new drive when it is full
22:46  Yahav: nightwalk:  ok i see
22:46  nightwalk: That's why it's important to encrypt data ahead of time. If it's encrypted, you at least have a reasonable expectation that no one on the other end of the RMA can decrypt it
22:46 * ananke has a stash of about 200 drives waiting to be destroyed
22:46  diegoviola: how do i make wget run in the bg, wget blah &?
22:47  bocaneri: I DO. All the interesting stuff is stored in an encrypted directory, encrypted before it went into that directory and is furthermore accessible only if you know how to use the commands I created for retrieving them or are very VERY good at decrypting source-filtered perl.
22:47  nightwalk: diegoviola: I usually do 'wget -o <log file> blah &'
22:47  lolcat: ananke: Can I have some?
22:48  diegoviola: thx
22:48  nightwalk: bocaneri: obfuscation is useless. better to just add another layer of encryption instead
22:48  ananke: lolcat: bring a wheelbarrel
22:49  lolcat: ananke: Where?
22:49  bocaneri: nightwalk, obfuscation is for the frustration. It's not real security, but dual encryption layers IS a factor.
22:49  Yahav: nightwalk: so the command is: "dd if=/dev/urandom" ? and this is complitly safe for the content in use right..
22:49  ananke: lolcat: it was a joke, if you missed it. those drives are due for destruction
22:49  lolcat: ananke: I have destroied a lot of disks recently
22:50  nightwalk: yahav: assuming the data was on your /home partition, you could do something like 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=~/random.file', then delete ~/random.file when the volume runs out of space
22:51  Yahav: ohhhh i see,
22:51  Yahav: then i will  create a file using  the whole space he can get
22:51 * kehcho say good night all... | buenas noches a todos :)
22:52  tmkd: hi, when i run make from terminal it works fine(use arm-none-eab-gcc) but when i build from eclipse make returns error 127
22:52  nightwalk: yahav: correct. if you specified 'count=' & optionally 'bs=', it'd limit the amount of data that'd be written. Without, dd just keeps writing until some condition (like 'out of space') forces it to stop
22:53  tmkd: it says that 'there is not arm-none-eabi-gcc'
22:53  tmkd: how to resolve this problem?
22:53  Yahav: nice
22:53  Yahav: that is actually pretty claver
22:53  tmkd: i have right PATH
22:53  nightwalk: tmkd: your $PATH is probably different inside of eclipse. specify the full path to the executable in the config
22:53 --- centosian_ is now known as centosian
22:53  tmkd: but how it is possible?
22:53  tmkd: nightwalk: eclipse has it own PATH?
22:54  nightwalk: tmkd: there are any number of things that could cause the executable to not be found. specifying the full path will solve 99% of them, though
22:55  nightwalk: You didn't give enough information to make anything other than generalizations, so that's the best answer you're going to get for what you've given
22:55  nightwalk: Garbage In, Garbage Out...
22:56  Yahav: nightwalk: is there any way this could harm my system?
22:56  tmkd: nightwalk: works:)
22:56  tmkd: nightwalk: thanks a lot
22:57  nightwalk: yahav: if you run it as root, and you do something bone-headed like overwriting an existing file that's used by the system. Otherwise, it's harmless. You don't even need to be root to do it, really
23:00  nightwalk: Some daemons may get upset if they can't write to their log files, but that's about it. if anything starts acting strange, restart it, or reboot the machine.
23:02  Yahav: so i could do this until drive out of space, then "shred output.file", repeat about 3 times...
23:02  Yahav: that would be good?
23:03 * marduk wonders what Yahav is trying to get rid of
23:03  Yahav: marduk: you would never guess
23:03  nightwalk: yahav: yes, I suppose you could shred the file instead of re-running the dd. didn't even think of that
23:04  Yahav: marduk: got a clue?!
23:04  marduk: huh?
23:05  nightwalk: I'm guessing it's the maps to where you hid the bodies
23:05  Yahav: LMAO, i said its a text documents
23:06  nightwalk: Fine, DIRECTIONS to where you hid the bodies ;)
23:06  Yahav: lol, you would never guess, because its pretty stupid actually
23:06  bocaneri: C'mon, share!
23:07 * nightwalk wishes they'd stop playing so many cop shows on tv :/
23:08  Yahav: lets just say my gf is a geek engineer, and she's taking my laptop for the weekend...
23:09  nightwalk: Hmm...pretty good reason to use a crypto volume ;)
23:09  [R]: and you dont want to her to find your porn
23:09  [R]: lol
23:10  Yahav: LOL i told you guys, no chance in hell i'm going to delete my porn
23:10  Yahav: gf or not
23:10  nightwalk: Not that it'd help you anyway. girlfriends can tell these things even in absence of proof ;)
23:10  Yahav: nightwalk: so true mate
23:10  nightwalk: Absence of proof is not proof of absence, after all
23:11  tensorpudding: this isn't a technical problem, this is a social one...
23:11  nightwalk: Ah, but it's a social problem that at least partially has a technical answer
23:12  Yahav: well, its pretty much started as a rat an mouse game, then she found some picures of my ex and me...
23:13  Yahav: and lets just say, me and my ex are closer then ever these days, and bloody pidgin logs could been recovered
23:13  tensorpudding: ah, infidelities, not porn
23:13  Yahav: (like she already did once)
23:14  tensorpudding: you could delete the offending pictures
23:14  Yahav: its bloody complicated, dont judge me
23:14  bocaneri: Sounds to me more like a question of social engineering than of computer science of any sort. A technological approach to your conundrum does not exist, not an effective one.
23:14  nightwalk: That's not even a social problem. It's a psychological one...and not even on his end
23:15  Aliv3: i installed ubuntu onto windows
23:15  bocaneri: Which end?
23:15  Aliv3: how do i run it
23:15  nightwalk: jealousy reflects a lack of confidence in oneself, and more often than not causes problems in the long term
23:15  bocaneri: Aliv3, describe the process by which you "install" ubuntu "onto windows".
23:15  OfficeSquatter: How do I close a port on a CentOS server?
23:16  OfficeSquatter: WHM/cPanel/allthatjazz
23:16  Aliv3: eh i deleted it
23:16  Yahav: OfficeSquatter: Oo - just close the proggram using it
23:16  Aliv3: hold up lemme reinstall
23:16  OfficeSquatter: I need the program open - it'
23:16  OfficeSquatter: It's memcache
23:16  OfficeSquatter: I just don't want it accessible from the outside
23:16  marduk: sigh
23:16  [R]: OfficeSquatter: DROP the port with iptables
23:16  Yahav: iptables
23:16  nightwalk: OfficeSquatter: iptables
23:16  OfficeSquatter: right on.  Thanks much!
23:16  Yahav: lol
23:16  marduk: OfficeSquatter: if you turned on firewalling by default it won't be open
23:16  Aliv3: oh good god hes singing
23:16  Aliv3: br
23:16  Aliv3: b
23:17  OfficeSquatter: Firewall Status: Enabled but in Test Mode - Don't forget to disable TESTING in the Firewall Configuration
23:17  OfficeSquatter: I think that might have had something to do with it
23:17  Yahav: nightwalk: i wouldn't say she jealouse for no reason, as i said, its complicated as hell
23:17  tensorpudding: If you had the suspicion that your partner was not faithful, and you had access to their computer, would you respect their privacy?
23:18  Yahav: tensorpudding: HELL NO
23:18  Yahav: OfficeSquatter: OfficeSquatter: we said iptable not "a lame extension to manage it from cpanel aka ConfigServer Security&Firewall"
23:19  OfficeSquatter: I'm aware - I was referring to the Firewall comment
23:19  nightwalk: yahav: oh, it's very simple. Either she's willing to put up with it, or she isn't. If not, she can always move on, provided she has the self-confidence to do such a thing
23:19  Aliv3: allright
23:19  Aliv3: i put in my ubuntu cd
23:19  Aliv3: it says demo and full install
23:19  Aliv3: install inside windows
23:19  Aliv3: and learn more
23:19  Aliv3: im pressing install inside windows
23:20  bocaneri: Sounds like wubi, about which I know not one damn thing.
23:20  nightwalk: yahav: Either way, now you know why the rest of us use LUKS, TrueCrypt, etc ;)
23:20  Aliv3: alright im installing
23:20  tensorpudding: Yahav: it sounds like you're the one with something to hide, though
23:20  nightwalk: Aliv3: you might have more luck in #ubuntu
23:20  defrysk: Aliv3, i believe after install ubuntu should appear somewhere in some windows menue
23:20  Aliv3: but i thought ubuntu==linux
23:21  defrysk: Aliv3, thats a trolls remark
23:21  [R]: Aliv3: ubuntu is a linux distribution
23:21  sedulous: linux is a part of ubuntu
23:21  anoob: i don't have sound at all: lspci -v http://pastebin.com/HLXgqrBi . lsmod: http://pastebin.com/qN4sUjB7
23:21  sedulous: ubuntu is a superset of linux
23:21  [R]: Aliv3: each distribution does things their own way... so if you need help with how a certain distribution does something... than you need to talk to them
23:21  tensorpudding: Aliv3: it's like Android
23:21  Aliv3: whats android
23:21  tensorpudding: okay, forget the analogy
23:21  Aliv3: oh u mean android os
23:21  tensorpudding: yes
23:21  nightwalk: lol
23:21  tensorpudding: the things that run on phones
23:22  Yahav: LOL
23:22  Aliv3: yeayea
23:22  Aliv3: ok
23:22  Aliv3: (4:20:48 PM) Aliv3: but i thought ubuntu==linux
23:22  Aliv3: (4:21:04 PM) defrysk: Aliv3, thats a trolls remark
23:22  Yahav: Aliv3: type:  \/join #ubunto
23:22  sedulous: #ubuntu
23:22  Aliv3: \/join #ubuntu
23:22  Yahav: damn
23:22  tensorpudding: there is an #ubuntu channel
23:23  tensorpudding: it's a better place to ask ubuntu questions
23:23  ultralazer: uh I can't mount old cd-roms anymore they're not compatible.
23:23  [R]: ultralazer: compatible wit hwhat?
23:23  ultralazer: nautilus i guess
23:23  [R]: ultralazer: that makes no sense
23:23  ultralazer: i know
23:23  Yahav: nightwalk: i always wanted to start using encrypted drives, but i couldn't figure out how do i set this up
23:23  [R]: ultralazer: yet you are saying it
23:24  tensorpudding: ubuntu makes encrypted home pretty simple
23:24  tensorpudding: with the terrible downside that it seems to prevent hibernate
23:25  nightwalk: yahav: What's so hard about 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/container bs=1M count=<size_in_megs> && losetup /dev/loop3 /path/to/container && cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/loop3 devmapper_name'?
23:26  Yahav: please tell me that you're kiddin so i wouldn't feel like a bloody idiot
23:26  nightwalk: yahav: That's for creating the volume. Mounting is just something like 'losetup /dev/loop3 /path/to/container && cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop3 devmapper_name'
23:27  nightwalk: yahav: it only seems complicated because I chained several commands together.
23:27  Yahav: ok:
23:28  nightwalk: Basically, losetup links a /dev/loopX file to a physical file on the filesystem so it can be used by block commands. If you use a real partition, you don't even have to go through the losetup bits
23:29  nightwalk: The 'cryptsetup luksFormat'/'cryptsetup luksOpen' bits are the most important bits.
23:29  nightwalk: Everything else is fluff
