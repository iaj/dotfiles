08:32  archeleus: lautriv: I don't have total control over the server to check its route tables
08:32  p3nguin: It does two things: Holds the hammer back while the trigger is still pulled, and released the hammer back onto the trigger when the trigger is reset.
08:32  lautriv: archeleus, is your local machine even equipped with an official address ?
08:32  syn-ack: mostly your double actions have sears
08:32  syn-ack: singles can, but don't have to have one
08:32  p3nguin: My new P250 is DAO.  I'm wanting to tear it apart tomorrow and see how it works.
08:33  archeleus: lautriv: I don't think so, not official anyway
08:33  syn-ack: I don't like DAO.
08:34  p3nguin: 5.5 - 6.5 lbs trigger every time
08:34  syn-ack: That's heavy.
08:34  p3nguin: for DAO?
08:34  lautriv: archeleus, then write down the path, loh out ssh and write scp server:/the/path /localdir
08:34  lautriv: *log
08:34  p3nguin: Doing research on different triggers, I found lots of DA triggers with 10 or 12 lbs.
08:34  syn-ack: After I got done doing my trigger job single is 2.5 lb and double is 3.5 so...
08:34  SiegeX: hmm, yea, im not a fan of DAO
08:34  archeleus: lautriv: will try
08:34  archeleus: brb
08:35  syn-ack: p3nguin, that's what mine was before I did my trigger job on my primary.
08:35 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 259 seconds
08:35  syn-ack: about 10 lb DA and SA was about 5
08:36  p3nguin: I'm no gunsmith, so I don't know what needs done to might it lighter.  Do you polish it and use good lube, or is there more to it?
08:36  syn-ack: There's more to it but that's just the beginning
08:36  SiegeX: ohh, i have the video for you on trigger jobs
08:36  syn-ack: polishing alone can go a long way, p3nguin
08:37  p3nguin: Since the trigger has to cock the hammer, I'm sure the springs need changed too.
08:37  syn-ack: and/or cut
08:37  SiegeX: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCF2u3K743A
08:37  dregan: hi Guys
08:37  syn-ack: I've cut about a ring and half off my wolff hammer and piston spring
08:37  SiegeX: good youtube channel for gun reviews and the like
08:38  p3nguin: If I can get replacements, I might consider cutting.
08:39  syn-ack: p3nguin, check out the Armorers Course that AGI has.
08:39  syn-ack: Frickin' good stuff, man
08:39  lautriv: p3nguin, syn-ack, SiegeX get a room then, this is not ##weapons_for_dumbass
08:39  Jared21: freebsd torrent just finished, almost time to try and set thiss up lo
08:39  Jared21: l
08:40  syn-ack: wow
08:44 * Tsunami burps
08:44  archeleus: lautriv: It worked, thank you
08:45 * sauvin breaks wind uncontrollably and continuously
08:45  lautriv: archeleus, this was just b/c your client initiated the connection.
08:45 --- Obvious_MkII is now known as Obvious
08:45  p3nguin: syn-ack: 7mm Remington Magnum or 7mm Remington Ultra Magnum, and why?
08:45  Zenox: Do I need the same hard drive models when running them software raid5 (mdadm)?
08:46  syn-ack: p3nguin, since I assume that was a request that we stop, I'm going to withhold comment in the channel. Feel free to /pm tho
08:46  lautriv: Zenox, at best but minimum same sized
08:46  archeleus: lautriv: So if I need the server to initiate a connection, I need to use dyndns or something?
08:46  p3nguin: Oh.  One moment.
08:47  lautriv: archeleus, i guess more your problem was that client is on a LAN with NAT, you have to tell your router to pass ssh there.
08:47  archeleus: yeah I'm on a lan with NAT
08:47  lautriv: archeleus, redirect post 22 to this machine then.
08:48  lautriv: *port
08:48  p3nguin: When using RAID level 5, your capacity will be the size of the smallest disk, times the number of disks, minus the size of the smallest disk.
08:48  archeleus: lautriv: kinda like a workplace, I'll just stick to myself initiating the connection
08:48  Zenox: lautriv: I have three 1TB disks, but wanted to buy a 2TB now (because of the small difference in price). Only going to use 1TB out of 2TB anyway right now, but for upgrading later it could come in handy. The thing I'm a bit worried about is that the new one is 7200RPM and the older ones are 5700RPM. You know if that matters?
08:49  lautriv: Zenox, it matters for the average performance but you can do so.
08:50  SpiceMan: NO RAID, NO LOOT
08:50  sauvin: Zenox, bear in mind that large drives seem to have quality control problems. Create a reliable backup strategy.
08:51  koala_man: I just set up btrfs with mirroring. it allows you to basically raid1 devices of various sizes, and add/remove disks at runtime
08:51  lautriv: koala_man, is there a fsck right now ?
08:51  Zenox: lautriv: So the average performance is the same as the 5700RPM ones or lower? Doesn't matter that much really, it's pretty fast anyway :) I used a hardware raid previously and then I had to use exactly the same models, but software raid seem different in that regard
08:51  koala_man: I think that's still pending
08:52  sauvin: On my play machine, I installed buntu 10.10 on ext4 to see if it's as reliable as people say.
08:52  lautriv: Zenox, it's altering, depending on what drive is actually accessed.
08:52  SpiceMan: you expect to try reliability with ubuntu 10.10 ?
08:52  sauvin: The fs should do OK, even if the OS doesn't.
08:52  SpiceMan: s/test/try/
08:53  lautriv: sauvin, don't put valuable data on this combo
08:53  sauvin: I DID say my "play" machine.
08:53  Zenox: sauvin: Yes I know. I have all the important stuff on online backup, but thanks for the hint. Raid is not a backup solution.
08:53  SpiceMan: err... s/try/test/ :p
08:53  sauvin: If THAT machine borks, I'll just swear and chuck something else on it.
08:53  sauvin: My main machine, the one I HAVE to have? Debian stable.
08:54  Zenox: lautriv: Ah, that seems logical. Thanks for explaining and helping out, going to get that 2TB now
09:00  Inst|Netbook: does anyone own synaptics clickpad here?
09:00  Inst|Netbook: does anyone own a copy of synaptics clickpad here?
09:02  Jared21: hey do i need to extract the freebsd.img in the flash drive or just leave it as is?
09:03  p3nguin: Maybe the FreeBSD channel would know, 'cause I sure don't.
09:06  syn-ack: Jared21, leave it like it is and dd it to the pendrive.
09:07  syn-ack: sauvin, wrt ext4: I've been using it since it was stable on the installer and haven't had any issues with it. The only time I did was when it was still in development.
09:08  sauvin: That's comforting :)
09:09  Jared21: syn-ack I downloaded it like it was, formatted my flash drive to fat-32 then copied it to the flash drive. i tried to boot from flash and it does but nothing happens just a black screen with a tex _ blinking
09:09  syn-ack: It really is pretty rock solid now.
09:09  syn-ack: Jared21, copied it or dd'd it?
09:09  syn-ack: Jared21, it needs to be written with dd.
09:10  Jared21: I downloaded it directly to my laptop hard drive, then copied/pasted the file to the flash drive. By dd you mean direct download
09:10  Jared21: ?
09:10  syn-ack: no
09:10  Jared21: you mean i need to write the image to the flash drive via command line?
09:10 * [R] thinks someone is way over his head with fbsd
09:11  syn-ack: Jared21, yes.
09:11  Jared21: alright i think i can do that, thanks for clarifying
09:12  syn-ack: Jared21, The documentation should tell you what you need to do
09:12  Jared21: ya i'm searchin for it now, should have gone there first pretty dumb not to
09:13  syn-ack: Jared21, dd does a block by block copy of the .img file to the usb drive. That's why it needs to be dd'd
09:13  Jared21: makes sense, also I just found the relevant documentation, awesome
09:18  syn-ack: Jared21, Think of dd as the UNIX version of RAWRITE
09:18  syn-ack: anyway, I'm gonna crash. later.
09:18  Jared21: thanks for the help
09:21  Jared21: what is the advantage of having a 64 bit operating system?
09:22  Zhwazi: unsigned integers greather than 4 billion
09:23  Zhwazi: greater*
09:23  Zhwazi: Including memory addresses
09:23  Zhwazi: 64-bit intel and AMD chips also have a few other upgrades like NX
09:24  Zhwazi: More registers, bigger registers
09:31  sauvin: I'm so far out of it nowadays... no damned idea what might be available for Windows or not. What the hell is "rawwrite"?
09:35  bl^ckh0le: is there any way to get the total time a process has been running, in hours, minutes, seconds?
09:35  bl^ckh0le: I do not want CPU time, I want total run time
09:35  bl^ckh0le: real time
09:36  N4ND: bl^ckh0le: you mean time (command)?
09:36  bl^ckh0le: no
09:36  bl^ckh0le: I mean look it up
09:36  bl^ckh0le: damnit, such info should be stored in the kernel
09:37  koala_man: bl^ckh0le: ps -o lstart -p pid
09:37  bl^ckh0le: thank you
09:38  bl^ckh0le: 89 minutes...damn this comp is slow
09:39  bl^ckh0le: I prefer bsdstart
09:40  bl^ckh0le: or even started
09:40  bl^ckh0le:  STARTED   PID CMD
09:40  bl^ckh0le: 20:49:39   300 make -f client.mk build
09:40  bl^ckh0le: it is now 21:41 :(
09:40  sveinse: Hello, is this a place to ask make(file) and/or bash questions?
09:41  bl^ckh0le: sure
09:41  bl^ckh0le: you can ask those here
09:42  sveinse: Bash question: How can I do recursive variable substitution, something like this:  VAR_a=foo  VAR_b=bar   SELECT=b    echo ${VAR_$SELECT}
09:43  cmnky: bash twists my head in 4 dimensions
09:44  SpiceMan: sveinse: use associative arrays.
09:44  sveinse: SpiceMan: thanks
09:44  bl^ckh0le: eval echo \$VAR_$Vb
09:45  bl^ckh0le: like that
09:45  bl^ckh0le: some people say eval is the root of all evil, but it is needed for that, afaik
09:46  SpiceMan: using variables' values as variables names is one of the ingredients in the recipe for armageddon
09:46  cmnky: SpiceMan, the exception being CAM memories in routers ? ;)
09:48  sauvin: In perl, eval is used to trap possible error conditions that could arrest the running process.
09:48  Jared21: what does "MEMDISK seems to have a fractional end cylinder" mean
09:48  bl^ckh0le: what the heck is a MEMDISK? some DOS shit?
09:48  Jared21: MEMDISK: Image seems to have a fractional end cylinder* I mean.
09:48  cmnky: what up sauvin ... long time no chat
09:48  SpiceMan: cmnky: no. armaggedon will be sparked by routers (?)
09:49  sauvin: It means MEMDISK seems not to end evenly on a cylinder boundary.
09:49  bl^ckh0le: armaggedon will be sparked by crackers warring with hackers
09:49  SpiceMan: it says so in the Quran, Bible, Torah. Charles Manson confirmed it and went crazy.
09:49  cmnky: SpiceMan, routers and flying drones ... aka skynet ... sure
09:49  bl^ckh0le: `lol
09:49  Jared21: Can re-writing the image to the boot medium correct that problem, sauvin?
09:49  bl^ckh0le: Charles Manson is a dumbass
09:49  Jared21: or is it even a problem
09:49  sauvin: No, armageddon will be sparked by strange women who walk down streets totally nude after busting out of storefront windows and have inflatable gagonzas.
09:50  bl^ckh0le: roflmao
09:50  sauvin: Jared21, no clue.
09:50  Jared21: alright, i'll just keep experimenting
09:51  cmnky: sauvin ... you not gonna say hello ? are the memories of late night arguments that horrible ?
09:51  sauvin: Oh, sorry. Eating pizza. What did we used to argue about?
09:51  sauvin: Oh, wait... I think I know who you are.
09:51  bl^ckh0le: why does it say ##linux-overflow in irssi?
09:52  sauvin: You're the guy who used to love Gentoo so much you spent three days building something I apt-getted in about two minutes?
09:52  bl^ckh0le: hahah
09:52  SpiceMan: nude routers and women with inflatable CAMs
09:52  bl^ckh0le: I'm building firefox 3.6.12 for an hour and 45 minutes
09:52  bl^ckh0le: xD
09:52  cmnky: sauvin ... um ... b*tch ;)
09:52  sauvin: cmnky, I won't say your full name in public if you are who I think you are.
09:53  sveinse: Can I repeat a recipe to multiple rules in make?
09:53  cmnky: cmonkey is my full name ;0
09:53  sauvin: You said it, not me :D Where you been?
09:54 --- bl^ckh0le is now known as unionfs
09:54 --- unionfs is now known as bl^ckh0le
09:54  sauvin: unionfs == black hole? It's THAT bad?
09:54  SpiceMan: sveinse: wait. you didn't say it was for make. associative arrays in bash started in version 4 (I think). if you rely on it systems with 3.X will fail.
09:54  bl^ckh0le: sauvin: I think so, yeah
09:54  SpiceMan: s/make/distributing/
09:54  cmnky: sauvin ... working, trying to prevent life from getting in the way of working, dieing from unknown illness ... the usual
09:54  sveinse: SpiceMan: I didn't. I'm working on both, so my prior was bash and my latter was make
09:55  sauvin: Illness?
09:55  bl^ckh0le: It hides crap, and if you use it for package management, you have to edit the package files from /pkg/$PKGNAME/etc/XX instead of /etc/<file from $PKGNAME> for it to work right
09:55  SpiceMan: ok
09:55  bl^ckh0le: fbcondecor is much better
09:55  cmnky: yeah ... thought i had worms ... but the doc gave me anti-worm medicine and i didn't see any monsters in the toilet
09:56  sauvin: So mortality is figurative at the moment rather than literal?
09:56  cmnky: doc gave me some anti-biotic as well, and it seems to be helping ... won't know until it plays out
09:57  cmnky: i dunno ... all those cigs i smoked could have given me pancreatic cancer or something i don't yet know about ... but given that im feeling better, im not betting on it being too serious
09:57  sauvin: (MmMMmm... Elizabeth Pena in Jacob's Ladder... she didn't have honkers, per se, but her beeplets certainly were yummy-looking...)
09:58  cmnky: i had a run in with a rat ... a/c buttheads didnt seal the duct work ... finally blew its head off with a .22 ... got sick shortly after, hence, the reason i thought i had worms
09:58  sauvin: Yea. Can't play too many games with rats. How did you dispose of it?
09:59  bl^ckh0le: pick it up by the tail?
09:59  sveinse: No one knows if you can reuse a recipe in make?
09:59  bl^ckh0le: sveinse: try ##workingser
09:59  bl^ckh0le: sveinse: try ##workingset
09:59  cmnky: soaked it with original formula lysol ... let it sit for 10-15 mins ... blasted it ... tripple plastic bagged it with gloves on ... lysoled the entire house/baseboards
09:59  sauvin: "recipe"?
09:59  sauvin: cmnky, yea, sounds like you took reasonable precautions.
10:00  sveinse: "recipe" is the make manual's definitions of the commands being executed after a rule
10:00  Robuster: i guess this is a pretty long shot, but does anyone know what hosting panel/http deamon that brings the default 404 message as "OOPS!....Page Error 404 has occurred" (sample: http://173.83.0.180/404 ) ?
10:00  bl^ckh0le: of course...
10:00  cmnky: wikipedia is a wonderful reference for dealing with such things ;)
10:00  sveinse: a: b \n \t some_recipe
10:00  Psi-Jack: Robuster: Nope. But that's pretty lame if you ask me.
10:01  bl^ckh0le: Robuster: try fetching HTTP headers
10:01  bl^ckh0le: or nmap probe it
10:01  bl^ckh0le: the latter could get you in trouble
10:01  Psi-Jack: bl^ckh0le: Ahem.
10:01  bl^ckh0le: what?
10:01  Psi-Jack: HTTP headers, okay. nmap probing?
10:01  sauvin: How do you use nmap to see if a particular port on another machine on the net is reachable?
10:01  bl^ckh0le: nmap probing is just OS detection
10:02  cmnky: does it use the pof library ?
10:02  Psi-Jack: nmap is a portscanner tool you use on systems you own, not others you don't.
10:02  sveinse: Point is, I have a rather long list of commands, but they only rely on $< and $@. And I need for another target as well. I hoped I didn't need to copy paste.  I could use canned recipes (define)
10:02  bl^ckh0le: sauvin: nmap -NP -p <port> <IP>
10:02  sauvin: Psi-Jack, I own the machine presently sitting in my bedroom. :P
10:02  bl^ckh0le: Psi-Jack: doesn't mean you can't use it on others you don't...
10:02  bl^ckh0le: like...friend's pcs
10:03  Psi-Jack: bl^ckh0le: It's /not/ supported here.
10:03  bl^ckh0le: if they ask you
10:03  cmnky: been trying to lock down security better myself
10:03  cmnky: soo many holes ... so little time
10:04  bl^ckh0le: use vulnerable linux so that you don't care that you have less security xD
10:04  cmnky: speaking of ... anyone know of a decent gis app for linux that does mapping w/ a C API i can add mapoints/layers with in real time ?
10:04  sauvin: Something like damn vulnerable linux would give people like cmnky screaming seizures.
10:05  bl^ckh0le: sauvin: excellent!
10:05  cmnky: i already don't like the name ... i probably won't look at it ;)
10:05  sauvin: cmnky, as I understand it, it's a teaching/testing distro, not actually meant for "real" use.
10:05  cmnky: im sure
10:05  bl^ckh0le: sauvin: does damn vulnerable linux have a vulnerable kernel as well?
10:06  sauvin: No clue. I don't even want it TOUCHING my ZIP code.
10:06  cmnky: if you had a spare box, and wanted to test your super-duper-hacker-harness v2 ... it's probably useful
10:06  bl^ckh0le: ZIP code?
10:07  sauvin: Other countries call it "postal code", but I'm stuck in the US.
10:07  cmnky: but i dont work for US cyber command ... so i've no real need for it
10:07  bl^ckh0le: damn Po
10:07  bl^ckh0le: you'll figure it out...eventually...
10:07  cmnky: and if i did work for US cyber command ... id just use any old federal box for testing ... as it prob has twice as many holes ;)
10:08  bl^ckh0le: opps...overtime
10:08  bl^ckh0le: 3$$70133
10:09  cmnky: i tried to go to the local "government supported" clinic to get a prescription ... and the a**hats 1) gave me the wrong address 2) gave me incorrect instructions for signing in and 3) argued with me when i tried to pay full price to avoid financial disclosure forms
10:10  cmnky: if obamacare stays in effect ... we're all doomed
10:10  bl^ckh0le: absolutely
10:10  cmnky: i walked out after waiting 2 hours
10:10  bl^ckh0le: cmnky: I bet you know what Po means
10:10  bl^ckh0le: spcs ar yu frnds
10:10  cmnky: pissed off ?
10:11  bl^ckh0le: no
10:11  cmnky: Pb is lead
10:11  bl^ckh0le: it's not an element
10:11  cmnky: isnt it ?
10:11  bl^ckh0le: I said Po, not Pb
10:11  cmnky: how many clues do i get before the 5th grader wins ?
10:11  bl^ckh0le: um...4
10:11  chris_osx: Polonium?
10:11  bl^ckh0le: no
10:12  bl^ckh0le: Pus
10:12  cmnky: if i were russian i would have guessed polonium
10:12  chris_osx: you mean if you were polish?
10:12  bl^ckh0le: PUS
10:12  cmnky: im stumped, i give up ... what is Po ?
10:12  bl^ckh0le: Pres O
10:13  cmnky: oh .. thats POTUS
10:13  opalepatrick: I updated to 2010.1 on Mandriva yesterday with x86_64 but after it updated a load of apps it refused to boot on reload stopping at initrd.img. I have tried rebuilding it by going back to the previous kernel but am getting 'No modules available for kernel' Any ideas?
10:13  Termana: bl^ckh0le, Pres O Dent BAMA
10:13  Termana: Foshizzle my nizzle
10:14  cmnky: opalepatrick ... make and install the missing modules ?
10:14  Psi-Jack: Alright guys. The language of this channel is in fact, English only.
10:14  bl^ckh0le: Termana: yes
10:14  cmnky: <--- doesn't know how mandriva works
10:14  bl^ckh0le: this is english
10:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [##linux +o Psi-Jack]
10:14 @Psi-Jack: I won't say it again.
10:15  Termana: That sounds a little racist to me, but whatever.
10:15  opalepatrick: cmnky: Sounds right, just going into unknown territory for me
10:15  cmnky: i hope im not in trouble again ... i just signed back onto freenode after a year or more of being off
10:15 @Psi-Jack: Termana: What's sounding racist?
10:15  CoolCoder: anyone help me to install control panel on VPS ubunto server.
10:15  CoolCoder: or some references
10:15  cmnky: opalepatrick ... yeah, initrd.img = initial ramdisk image
10:16 @Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: Ask a more specific question, or call your VPS provider for support you already pay for.
10:16  cmnky: opalepatrick ... distros typically put modules the kernel needs to boot in there ... so they are available before / gets mounted
10:16  Termana: Psi-Jack, Nothing it's fine, was just joking
10:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [##linux -o Psi-Jack]
10:16  bl^ckh0le: so...err...
10:17  bl^ckh0le: How long does xulrunner usually take to compile?
10:17  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: I am looking for something to learn myself
10:17  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: OKay. Well. You still haven't asked a specific question.
10:19  bl^ckh0le: it must take 14 or 15 standard build units...
10:19  bl^ckh0le: all because of "-O2 -march=pentium4m"...
10:21  sauvin: Mmm... Elizabeth Pena and those wonderful little jahoobies...
10:22  sauvin: Psi-Jack, what exactly did you find "not English"?
10:22  bl^ckh0le: crud... (((92+(60-49((*60)-39)/((20+6*60)*16.4)
10:23  Psi-Jack: sauvin: The whole jibberish they were doing earlier, which was actually seemingly partially racist as well.
10:23  sauvin: Did you find POTUS "gibberish"?
10:23  bl^ckh0le: crud... (((92+(60-49)+(60-39)/((20+6*60)*16.4)
10:23  bl^ckh0le: racist? no
10:24  sauvin: bl^ckh0le, what's "crud" about this expression?
10:24  bl^ckh0le: definitely not racist
10:24  bl^ckh0le: sauvin: it is the total percentage of time left until 16.4 build units have passed
10:24  sauvin: !!
10:24  sauvin: In milliseconds, I hope.
10:25  bl^ckh0le: this is it... (((92+(60-49))*60/((20+6*60)*16.4)
10:25  bl^ckh0le: no, in seconds
10:25  Agent001: what is the best linux distro besides ubuntu?
10:25  sauvin: Agent001, depends on what you call "best".
10:26  Agent001: I'm currently a Ubuntu user. but i need something more professional
10:26  mAniAk-_-: debian or archlinux maybe
10:26  Agent001: are you on it?
10:26  Agent001: i'll check out archlinux since that came up a lot
10:26  sauvin: "more professional"?
10:28  Psi-Jack: Agent001: www.distrowatch.com
10:29  cmnky: i think someone just ate tor's onion
10:29  Agent001: wow
10:30  Agent001: all those distros
10:30  Termana: Agent001, what kind of requirement is that? More professional as in... what?
10:30  Agent001: I thought there only exists a few, ubuntu, arch, fedora
10:30  sauvin: Yup, there are a few. What means "professional" in your idiolect?
10:30  Psi-Jack: Agent001: Hence why there's no POSSIBLE way to answer "best" questions.
10:30  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: I have a VPS server with root access. I am trying to install a control panel to manage server through a weblink. Is there any open source i can install my self? Can anyone provide some reference to do. Please not i have a Ubunto VPS server
10:31  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: sorry got DC
10:31  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: "Control Panel?" That's in Windows. ;P
10:31  sauvin: Either that or Webmin :D
10:31  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: whats there for Linux? Webmin is ok.
10:31  cmnky: CoolCoder, there are lots of "web based administration" packages ... each typically tailored for some specific app ... glue em all together with an index.html page
10:31  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: What exactly are you looking for?
10:32  Jared21: what is i386 vs i686
10:32  Psi-Jack: i386 and i686
10:32  Psi-Jack: Exactly that.
10:32  Jared21: what do they mean though
10:32  cmnky: Jared21, cpu families
10:33  Psi-Jack: Intel 386, Intel 486
10:33  Psi-Jack: Err, Intel 686
10:33  Jared21: ah ok
10:33  CoolCoder: As i have said i recently bought a VPS server. Nothing to control the server. my old server have a webmin access so as i can manage server things through that. Now in the new VPS Ubunto i  like install something like webmis so as i can control through a web URL
10:33  CoolCoder: :-(
10:33  Jared21: god damn me
10:33  cmnky: wikipedia:x86
10:33  Jared21: downloaded i386 and my processor is i686
10:33  Jared21: fuck
10:33  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: So, what's wrong with Webmin?
10:33  Psi-Jack: Jared21: Please do not use such language here.
10:33  CoolCoder: Nothing wrong. i love webmin
10:34  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: So, then, question answered. Webmin, anything else?
10:34  cmnky: Jared21, it'll still work ... just will run a little slower
10:34  Psi-Jack: cmnky: Not really.
10:34  sauvin: I've heard webmin is a huge gaping security hole, though. I tried it once and wasn't impressed.
10:34  CoolCoder: nothing. will come back after google
10:34  cmnky: Psi-Jack, why 'not really' ?
10:34  Psi-Jack: sauvin: It's pretty secure.
10:34  Psi-Jack: cmnky: Look at Debian, for example.
10:34  Psi-Jack: Everything's compiled for i386, and it runs fast.
10:35  cmnky: hence, "a little slower"
10:35  Psi-Jack: For 32-bit et all.
10:35  sauvin: Bear in mind cmnky is a Gentoo crusader :D
10:35  Psi-Jack: Yeah, an idiot if you ask me.
10:35  Termana: :p
10:35  Psi-Jack: Gentooian crusaders are the kind that assume too much and don't know.
10:35  cmnky: im not a 'gentoo' crusader ... i am, however, a performance junkie .... only related to gentoo via secondary associations
10:36  SolomonKull: Gentoo is for masochists.
10:36  Termana: heh
10:36  Termana: I think your out-numbered here cmnky
10:36  SolomonKull: Masochists with a lot of free time.
10:36  Termana: SolomonKull, that video was good that you linked me to yesterday
10:36  sauvin: Dunno... if I didn't have to work for a living, I might even have tried gentoo myself.
10:36  Termana: There are places where it cannot apply though
10:36  cmnky: termana ... it's alright ... for every monkey willing to go the extra mile ... there are 100 men who won't ;)
10:36  SolomonKull: Termana: I have no idea what video you're talking about.  Which one?
10:37  paszczus: Hello. I`m looking for DVB TV Tuner which is running fine on Linux, please tell me which one i should buy ;-) Thanks
10:37  Termana: SolomonKull, the one that talked about trying to sell the ecosystem rather than the software
10:37  cmnky: paszczus, a DVB "tuner" ... or a TV card that you watch tv with ?
10:40  cmnky: DVB = broadcasting ... opposite of reception
10:40  paszczus: cmnky: em, tv card
10:40  paszczus: cmnky: but i want to connect my satellite tv to it
10:40  cmnky: i have one of the happauge cards ... $30 used off ebay ... PVR-150/250/350 series ... it works
10:40  paszczus: and watch my sattelite programs on my computer
10:40  cmnky: doesn't do QAM tho
10:40  Jared21: amd64 will work for family for core 2 duo even though it's intel right?
10:40  sauvin: What's QAM?
10:40  cmnky: Jared21, maybe ... your mileage will vary
10:40  cmnky: sauvin ... isn't that what the new digital video junk is called ?
10:40  sauvin: No idea. I don't even have a TV or TV service.
10:40  Jared21: so freebsd has no release that's native for the core 2 duo processor?
10:40  Psi-Jack: Jared21: #freebsd
10:40  cmnky: or the extended HD cable stuff ... i dunno ... its the "new" tuner ... extent of my knowledge reached
10:41  paszczus: cmnky: i`m looking for a card with hardware encoding and digital, not analog
10:41  cmnky: Jared21, i686 is close to core 2 duo .... if it does have a core 2 duo specific flavor ... the difference will barely be measureable
10:41  cmnky: paszczus ... good luck ... when i went looking for a card with QAM / digital tuner ... about a year ago ... none of the drivers were marked as stable/production
10:42  cmnky: paszczus ... after researching it for "too long" ... i gave up and bought the used card
10:43  paszczus: cmnky: :)
10:43  cmnky: it does have hardware mpeg in it ... just not a QAM / digital tuner
10:43  paszczus: damn, that`s sad
10:43  sauvin: It's not surprising it takes the linux community a while to catch up to new hardware :\
10:44  cmnky: mplayer w/ vdpau decoders eats about 6-7% cpu on a Q6600 ... which i find really acceptable ... i just tune it to channel 3, and use an external cable box to change channels
10:44  cmnky: because the ivtv tuning command line is too kudgy to use for channel surfing
10:44  paszczus: cmnky: hmm, well, maybe i don`t need that QAM so much , cause i want to connect cable from satellite tuner to it
10:44  cmnky: er..kludgy
10:45  paszczus: so QAM is in digital tuner, tv card needs only to take a signal, right ?
10:45  cmnky: there you go ... analog channel 3
10:45  Psi-Jack: Bleh, there is one thing I'm still not presently liking about both Debian /and/ Ubuntu right now. heh
10:45  sauvin: What's that?
10:45  Psi-Jack: Their pacemaker cluster stack is horrible and unstabilized, to date.
10:45  cmnky: QAM is the new "digital tuner" ... Analog is the old CATV/VHF/UHF type tuner
10:46  cmnky: paszczus, like ... if you had the catv company extended cable package, and wanted to tune all those channels above 110-120 or so ... you'd need QAM
10:46  Psi-Jack: Heck, between Debian 5.0 and Ubuntu 10.04, just trying to find the right repositories to get dlm_controld.pcmk and ocfs2 stuff, is a pain in the arse.
10:47  cmnky: paszczus, OR ... do like me, use external tuner, to channel 3 ... and not worry about HD/Music/Used Car Review channels
10:47  paszczus: cmnky: ok, almost get it :) I want to use that tuner with my cable TV  AND satellite. I just want to see video on my linux using VLC
10:48  cmnky: paszczus, i also have some cheap video capture cards i use for CCTV .. but no sound, and no tuner on them ... BNC input from analog cameras
10:48  sauvin: Psi-Jack, what's your attitude towards distros like openSUSE?
10:48  Psi-Jack: sauvin: I'm actually using OpenSUSE 11.3 right now for my dual-NAS SAN cluster.
10:49  Psi-Jack: As well as my LDAP servers.
10:49  cmnky: paszczus, like i said ... a year ago ... my options were ... new card / new drivers / screw with unstability / hope it works for $100+ ... or used card .. ebay ... $30 ... works
10:49  paszczus: cmnky: http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices that`s nice
10:49  sedulous: SolomonKull: if it is ony for masochists with a lot of free time, how do you explain profitable companies that run it on thousands of servers?
10:49  cmnky: paszczus, no ... don't use USB for video ... that's asking for trouble
10:49  sedulous: s/ony/only/
10:50  Psi-Jack: sauvin: So, pretty good. I /HAD/ issues with opensuse as a server before, because of lack of maintaince needed in various packages that took 6 months to finally get attention on, but now that it's resolved, I'm happy again.
10:50  sedulous: cmnky: USB is fine for DVB-T
10:50  sauvin: I would suggest that maybe large companies can afford fast machines and knowledgeable people and have a driving need for minute gains in performance.
10:50  Psi-Jack: sauvin: As a virtual server... I hate it. They broke virt-manager with novell's wizardry which sucks.
10:51  sauvin: Hrm. Think I'll continue with my plan to chuck pcbsd on my other lappie.
10:51  sedulous: sauvin: Yes, which means Gentoo can make sense. Not everyone of its users is a hobbyist ricer.
10:51  Psi-Jack: Finally, as a desktop, OpenSUSE is still my all-time favorite desktop distro. ;)
10:51  cmnky: sedulous, if you say so ... USB hardware / drivers are buggy at high speed ... at least my hardware / kernels are
10:51  Psi-Jack: Linux Mint coming in second place.
10:51  sedulous: cmnky: i had good experiences with my USB DVB-T stick. not a fluke in years.
10:51  paszczus: sedulous: which model?
10:51  sauvin: I tried Mint. Can't talk about its technical merits, but I found its interface obnoxious.
10:51  SolomonKull: OpenSUSE does the best KDE desktop, followed by Mandriva.
10:52  Psi-Jack: sauvin: I love it's custom unique application launcher.
10:52  cmnky: you know ... i switched to gentoo because fedora sucked ... if there were a lighter / faster / better distro ... i might look at it ... have yet to see it, so i don't switch
10:52  Psi-Jack: SolomonKull: Mancrank? Are you serious? No way.
10:52  Psi-Jack: Fedora's KDE is far better than Mancrank's.
10:52  sedulous: paszczus: Wideview WT-220U chipset
10:52  SolomonKull: Psi-Jack: It was nice for the 15-20 minutes I used it.
10:52  paszczus: cmnky: use Sabayon :) it`s gentoo-based binary distro
10:52  sauvin: I switched from Fedora to Ubuntu because Fedora sucked. I switched from Ubuntu to Debian because I like Ubuntu sorta kinda but got fried out at it.
10:52  Psi-Jack: SolomonKull: Give it 24 hours, try using the configuration tools, and you will see how lousy it really is.
10:53  cmnky: sedulous ... perhaps your usb drivers / hardware isnt buggy ... my guess is it works better on laptops, with custom chipsets, than it does on commodity stuff
10:53  Psi-Jack: All you need is 24 hours to know how unreliable it is. :)
10:53  EdwardIII: i used ubuntu and liked it, but switched back to fedora because of the rpm toolchain
10:53  cmnky: paszczus, sure ... but its not gentoo ... its like ... bloated gentoo for people who don't want to compile isnt it ?
10:53  sauvin: Eww! RPM! Make it go away!
10:53  sedulous: cmnky: i'm just saying that USB 2.0 isn't necessarily bad. it's just a transport, fast enough for DVB-T. of course there might be buggy chipsets. i only know this one and it worked.
10:54  SolomonKull: Gentoo is pointless since modern hardware isnt slow as mud.  Gentoo's speed differences from other distros is so small its absolutly pointless to waste that much time on it, in my opinion.  Distros like Arch do a much better job at speed without the compile times.
10:54  paszczus: cmnky: sth like that. for me gentoo is for servers (got 25 servers on it) and sabayon or pld linux for desktop
10:54  sauvin: SolomonKull, you're right, but that kind of reasoning is also often used to rationalise bloat.
10:54  sedulous: I don't know a single Gentoo user personally who uses it for potential performance gains.
10:54  cmnky: sedulous, and buggy drivers, and buggy dbus/hal releases
10:54  EdwardIII: but if someone wants to recommend another distro which is superior and still has something like mock please do!
10:55  cmnky: sedulous, you do now
10:55  sedulous: SolomonKull: I know a company who would probably pay you a lot of money if you shared that knowledge and showed them how to replace their huge Gentoo server infrastructure with something much more profitable.
10:55  sedulous: cmnky: I don't know you personally :P
10:56  paszczus: sedulous: and could you told me which model is running on that chipset?
10:56  cmnky: sedulous .. my firewall / router box ... also runs 8 CCTV camera ports w/ motion detection ... gentoo lets me compile the libs w/ MMX SSE etc optimizations
10:56  SolomonKull: sedulous: Can you give me one good reason to use Gentoo?
10:56  cmnky: obviously you could do that with any other distro ... gentoo just makes it easy
10:56  SolomonKull: I dont care if companies use it, they also use Windows.
10:56  sedulous: paszczus: Freecom IIRC but it's not being sold anymore and worst of all, they sold different chipsets under the same name, so it's kind of hard to find this particular one
10:56  paszczus: SolomonKull: glsa.sh ;)
10:57  jelly: sedulous: making changes at infrastructure level is always expensive, no matter the start and end points
10:57  cmnky: SolomonKull, customization is its major selling point
10:57  sedulous: SolomonKull: customizing and rolling your own packages is very easy. they have good support for VCS-based packages, i.e. automatic checkout/updates and building from a VCS.
10:58  sedulous: the latter is something that some devs seem to like
10:58  SolomonKull: Does Gentoo even track dependancies when installing a package?
10:58  sauvin: It's been said that you can make any distro out of any other if you have the time or patience, but my understanding of distros like Gentoo is that you can make anything, and I DO mean *ANY* thing you want out of it that much more easily IF you have the time or patience.
10:58  sedulous: Okay, now you're a troll in my book, SolomonKull.
10:58  SolomonKull: sedulous: Does it?
10:58  cmnky: SolomonKull, yes ... with tools to automatically fix / remove unecessary dependencies
10:58  SolomonKull: cmnky: just liek any other distro, good.
10:59  jimbauwens: Hello
10:59  cmnky: SolomonKull, it also has "slots" .. in case you need 2 different versions of gtk+ or kde or whatever
10:59  jelly: sauvin: I can make anything out of Debian... if it makes sense to. ;-)
10:59  sauvin: cmnky, is gentoo's package management comparable to debian's dpkg?
10:59  paszczus: sedulous: damn, hard to find it for buying
10:59  cmnky: sauvin, i have no idea ... never used debian ... its apt right ?
10:59  SolomonKull: Gentoo is only good if you work as a dev.  You can use the "its compiling" excuse to your boos just so you can waste time on IRC.
10:59  jelly: it obviously is, else it wouldn't have survived
10:59  paszczus: sedulous: i need to find another one
11:00  jelly: SolomonKull: how many years have you spent admining Gentoo?
11:00  sedulous: paszczus: good luck. i'm not up to date about that.
11:00  sauvin: SolomonKull, have you ever actually even used gentoo?
11:00  paszczus: s/another/different/
11:00  cmnky: SolomonKull, you miss the point of gentoo
11:00  SolomonKull: People who praise Gentoo but have never used Debian are...well..missing out.
11:00  jimbauwens: I have setup a vpn server using pptpd, but when I connect to it using ubuntu, it fails. In /var/log/messages is see : IPCP: timeout sending Config-Requests . Anyone know what this might be?
11:00  sedulous: sauvin: I assume not.
11:00  jelly: people who talk about things they're not familiar with are... well... best ignored.
11:00  cmnky: SolomonKull, gentoo is like ... automated linux from scratch ... you get the box you want, without the fluff a committee decided to give you
11:01  SolomonKull: sauvin: yes, but not on my own machine.  My friend used to use it and I stayed at his place for a few weeks and was stuck on one of his computers the whole time.  I had free run of the box, but didnt do much since it took a damn 48hrs to install Gnome.
11:01  cmnky: no it doesnt
11:01  sauvin: So you didn't install or administer it, you were just a user.
11:01  SolomonKull: Past tense.  Learn to read.
11:01  sedulous: cmnky: which makes a lot of sense if you, for example, need to deploy 1000 identical customized setups. at that point, it can be less work to use a meta-distro like gentoo.
11:02  sedulous: (since you only have to maintain one master copy)
11:02  cmnky: SolomonKull, why would you compare a new gentoo install today, with your experience 10 years ago ? that isnt even relevant
11:02  SolomonKull: sauvin: Ive heard enough horror stories to know that the compile times for installing are crazy, like 8 hours or more.
11:02  EdwardIII: make world
11:02  SolomonKull: I watched somone compile Gentoo a few months ago, sloooow.
11:02  sedulous: i've _heard_ of "RPM hell" and yet don't spit out uninformed judgements about SUSE or RedHat.
11:02  Psi-Jack: Here's some fun for Gentoo.
11:03  sauvin: SolomonKull, since you don't speak from actual recent hands-on experience, your anti-Gentoo campaigning has very limited traction.
11:03  cmnky: if you want to rebuild your entire gentoo box ... make world ... go to sleep .. wake up and it'll be done
11:03  cmnky: and thats rebuilding *every* package ... which there is almost never a need to do
11:03  Psi-Jack: I worked for a company that was stupid and foolish enough to run Gentoo for ALL their Linux servers, routers, firewalls, etc, everything Linux was Gentoo.
11:03  EdwardIII: i prefer sudo yum update
11:03  sauvin: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade :)
11:04  Psi-Jack: Yet, no administrators, all "developers", that really didn't know how to truely administer not just Gentoo, but the servers that ran on them.
11:04  EdwardIII: apt > *
11:04  koala_man: Psi-Jack: haha, did they have one zealous sysadmin?
11:04  cmnky: if C compilers are scary black boxes to you ... don't get gentoo
11:04  Psi-Jack: koala_man: I became their ownly sysadmin for the time, yet they still called me a "developer"
11:04  seanjohn: you guys dont like suse linux?
11:04  SolomonKull: sauvin: my problems with Gentoo are still relevant.  Its slwo to compile, its not as performance boosting as the fanboys claim and is becoming irrelevant as hardware gets better.
11:05  cmnky: if you like apps that arent compiled to include 500 features you'll never use ... gentoo makes it easy to configure only what you want
11:05  Psi-Jack: seanjohn: Out of the blue you come in saying stuff like that... Why?
11:05  sedulous: seanjohn: who said that? i'm sure there are several content suse users in here
11:05  seanjohn: im asking?
11:05  sauvin: SolomonKull, your problems with gentoo are not relevant because your problems do not exist. They cannot exist until you have experience with it.
11:05  koala_man: SolomonKull: you're too hung up on the whole compilation aspect of gentoo
11:05  cmnky: koala_man, C scares him ... he's a perl monkey
11:05  seanjohn: I take it you like suse as well, Psi-Jack.
11:05  Psi-Jack: seanjohn: Kudos for completely blind thoughts. Sit down and listen, for a bit to catch up, or get on with things.
11:06  SolomonKull: koala_man: no, its not compiling, its TIME.  Its a waste of time when hardware isnt slow and old.
11:06  cmnky: "tell kitchen sink to do some voodo magic; END LOOP;"
11:06  seanjohn: nm so much for a conversation
11:06  SolomonKull: Anyone here use commercial Suse?
11:06  Psi-Jack: SolomonKull: I actually openly refuse to.
11:06  cmnky: if gentoo was useless ... it wouldn't exist
11:06  EdwardIII: ubuntu have got a lot of things right: particularly  installer and partitioning stuff
11:07  jelly: seanjohn: you've jumped into a middle of another heated conversation, and might have been read in that context even tho your line is completely unrelated
11:07  SolomonKull: Psi-Jack: elaborate.
11:07  seanjohn: SolomonKull: I only used free. I know Suse is one of the mainstreams, asside from redhat, that is preferred by google.
11:07  cmnky: if you want your linux like you get your windows ... in a giant pile, all at once, including the kitchen sink, don't pick gentoo
11:07  Psi-Jack: SolomonKull: If opensuse is a mark of the quality for well maintained packages, then SLES/SLED has got to be absolutely horrid, and Novell should've thought of that.
11:08  koala_man: SolomonKull: you're focusing too much on the time aspect of compilation of gentoo, then. it's really a great distro, it's not just debian with more scrolling crap
11:09  cmnky: waste time or waste resources ... its the age old tradeoff
11:09  EdwardIII: koala_man, that's what i'm interested in - aside from compilation, what does it bring to the game that redhat/debian doesn't?
11:09  SolomonKull: koala_man: if it does nothing that other distros can do, if not do better, then what use is it?  If I can do everything Gentoo can do, but without the compile times and headaches, why use Gentoo?
11:09  SolomonKull: If I was building a special box for kiosk or something then Gentoo might be a possibility.
11:09  cmnky: gentoo .. although most wouldn't think of it ... is actually very stable
11:09  SolomonKull: But that aside...
11:09  cmnky: new packages are "masked" until they are proven to be stable
11:10  Psi-Jack: cmnky: It's only as stable as the maintainer's abilities.
11:10  cmnky: security holes are "masked" so you can't install those versions, unless you "unmask" them and ask for the trouble specifically
11:10  koala_man: EdwardIII, SolomonKull: it has an excellent selection of updated packages. if you want the cvs version of freeciv or whatever, it'll handle that automatically. it will also let you choose dependencies, like if you want to run a multimedia server without X or add DeCSS support to all your relevant apps
11:10  cmnky: once you get used to dealing with "portage" which is gentoos package manager ... it's relatively painless
11:11  Psi-Jack: Which, for Gentoo, specifically, requires a LOT more knowledge, expertise, and elbow grease than the normal customs.
11:11  sauvin: I never hear anything about gentoo's stability. Given that I hear so much about OTHER distro's stability, usually in an unflattering light, maybe that says something.
11:11  SolomonKull: koala_man: you can do that with other distros. What makes Gentoo better than them?
11:11  cmnky: unless watching an app compile for a moment, causes you to freak out and drink more pepsi and cry to mom ... it's not a big deal
11:11  SolomonKull: Arch Linux is the Gentoo killer.
11:11  EdwardIII: koala_man, that does sound incredibly useful
11:11 * sauvin remembers "portage" from freebsd; it ain't dpkg, but it got the job done
11:11  EdwardIII: koala_man, i end up compiling a lot of stuff from source (perl, apache) which is then separate from package management
11:11  Psi-Jack: Actually, stock setup for Gentoo as a kvm server was attrociously unstable and prone to kernel panicks more than any other distro.
11:11  koala_man: SolomonKull: debian can't
11:12  sauvin: koala_man, debian can't what?
11:12  SolomonKull: Debian sure can.  Read the apt-get man page.
11:12  EdwardIII: SolomonKull, how can you do that with fedora?
11:12  cmnky: virtualbox runs flawlessly on my box
11:12  Psi-Jack: Source RPM's and rpmbuild
11:12  Jared21: i don't like gentoo because one of my friends who believes that it's "cool" to have only a console and never use a mouse for any reason
11:12  Jared21: uses gentoo
11:12  SolomonKull: EdwardIII: I never said *all* distros, I said *other*.  BIG difference.  Its best to not make assumptions and just read what I said instead.
11:13  cmnky: i have win7 in it ... seamless desktop integration ... to run a windows app i need
11:13  Jared21: (he could use a mouse obviously, he intentionally doesn't)
11:13  sauvin: virtualbox runs very very nicely on my laptop; debian stable host, Windows XP guest, runs heavy duty engineering software very nicely
11:13  cmnky: sauvin, i like virtualbox ... it just works
11:14  Jared21: what OS is virtualbox for?
11:14  Psi-Jack: virtualbox is okay for "desktop" virtualization, otherwise, it's crap.
11:14  sauvin: Jared21, that's a choice your friend made. X *is* available for gentot, and I presume all the crap I like in Debian is, too.
11:15  SolomonKull: Argh, I wish it would stop raining.
11:15  sauvin: As I understand it, VirtualBox will use almost any x86-based OS for a guest. Hosts? I think you're stuck with Windows, some of the BSDs, OS X and linux.
11:15  Jared21: I don't get him, he's better than me at this kind of stuff, but he thinks that it's more "programmer" and "elite" to not have a mouse. Thing is I program in c++ and java and I use a mouse.
11:15  cmnky: http://www.gentoo-portage.com/  <-- browse the package database to your hearts content
11:15  EdwardIII: SolomonKull, you're coming across quite defensively. i wasn't seeking to attack you, i'm just really interested as that's a problem i'm facing. i just thought it was a problem with all linux package management models
11:15  koala_man: SolomonKull: I must have read past that. how do I specify that debian should make all relevant apps support speex for example?
11:15  Jared21: For me the easier and simpler an operating system is the better, as long as it's also powerful
11:16  seanjohn: We have no ties in most other countries; so, xtables-addons and 'iptables -I INPUT 1-m geoip ! --source-country=US,GB,JA,MX,CA really helped our security logs to decrease. lol
11:16  seanjohn: sorry wrong channel
11:16  cmnky: koala_man, in gentoo ... edit /etc/make.conf ... add SPEEX to USE="" line ... done
11:16  koala_man: either that or 'ufed'
11:16  Psi-Jack: Wow, racist iptables rules. Sheash. ;)
11:16  SolomonKull: Psi-Jack: nations are not races.
11:17  sauvin: Jared21, be aware that different people have different priorities when using the word "simple". Arch is "simple", according to its adherents, and Debian *isn't* - but the point-and-click crowd would probably disagree.
11:17  Psi-Jack: SolomonKull: Then why does everyone in the world call them races?
11:17  cmnky: i installed ipset and banned all non US nations
11:17  cousin_mario: hello
11:17  cousin_mario: anyone using googleearth 6 beta?
11:17  cmnky: using the CIDR country networks list
11:17  seanjohn: Psi-Jack: you assume the rest of that is '-j DROP' YOu're right if you do but we're not racist. we are governmentally and locally contracted.
11:17  SolomonKull: Psi-Jack: They don;t.  They call races races.  They call nations nations.  Not everyone in the Canadian nation is the same race. Not everyone in the American nation is the same race.  This is pretty simple stuff, Psi-Jack...
11:18  seanjohn: we are of no  use to anyone outside of those countries because of FCC rules.
11:18  SolomonKull: Ethnicity =/= nationality =/= race
11:18  seanjohn: hint hint
11:18 * cousin_mario chimes in
11:18  SolomonKull: cousin_mario: not I.
11:18  cousin_mario: what has racism to do with iptables rules?
11:18  seanjohn: lol cousin_mario. Thanks
11:19  cmnky: iptables doesn't care what race you are
11:19  SolomonKull: cousin_mario: apparently Psi-Jack thinks country = race.
11:19  sauvin: But it CAN be made to care what country you're calling from :D
11:19  cmnky: it'll block your butt no matter your eye shape or skin color
11:19  seanjohn: its statelful and raceless
11:19  cmnky: sauvin, indeed ... reducing attack surface = good
11:20  cousin_mario: SolomonKull: one might have good reasons for keeping users from a certain country out of his network, regardless of what he/she thinks of them.
11:20  SolomonKull: cousin_mario: I know.
11:20  cmnky: i don't suppose any of the security gurus here are aware of an HTTPS proxy that will traceroute the connection before its made and confine the route to within country do you ?
11:20  Termana: Races? I hate those. Make my feet sore.
11:20  cmnky: im not aware if it exists, but im looking for a proxy that'll do it
11:21  jelly: cmnky: routes can change on the fly.
11:21  sauvin: Actually, I like races. When I used to have a TV, I'd turn to a channel with a nice, long auto race going on because the noise made it easier for me to get some nap time. I used to use baseball the same way.
11:22  cmnky: jelly, yes, they can ... just ask china telecom ... they are why i need it
11:22  cousin_mario: anyway, regarding google earth 6 beta: the package (force)created with the proper tool doesn't work and the installer fails
11:22  cousin_mario: anyone else wishing to give it a try elsewhere than ubuntu?
11:22  jelly: cmnky: I mean, the snapshot you take once may not be correct 5 minutes later
11:22  cmnky: it should scream loudly, preferrably in an authoritative female voice "China Telecom just hijacked BGP again ... disconnecting"
11:23  sauvin: What's BGP?
11:23  Psi-Jack: sauvin: Routing protocol.
11:23  jelly: sauvin: routing table exchange protocol that makes Internet work
11:23  cmnky: jelly .. thats okay ... checking every minute is better than never checking at all
11:23  jelly: cmnky: oh, alright
11:24  cmnky: jelly, HTTPS can be man in the middled during connection, but not so easily afterwards ... its just one more level of security
11:24  jelly: nod
11:25  cmnky: jelly, reduces the time window to a few seconds, as opposed to 24/7
11:26  cmnky: jelly, short of a dedicated leased line direct to destination ... it's about as good as it gets without a co-operating other party
11:27  cmnky: i can get the dedicated line ... but its $500 a month
11:27  Tsunami: cmnky: why do you need such a line?
11:27  cmnky: and i would bet, somewhere in the middle of that dedicated line ... are a bunch of IP packets ... so the telco might even mess that up
11:27  cmnky: Tsunami, connection to stock broker
11:31  functor: I have fetchmail and I want to fetch-and-store my emails in a format that I can easily backup but can be read by dovecot. i am currently using mbox, is there a better format (other than maildir)?
11:32  cmnky: jelly ... if the ip addresses were resolved via GEOIP it wouldnt matter if the address changed, so long as they were the same long/lattitude
11:32  cmnky: jelly, or a more relaxed rule would say something like "so long as the routes don't backtrack geographically, or leave the country"
11:34  cmnky: if a connection from atlanta to boston, suddenly got re-routed through mexico or china ... there would at least be a red flag
11:35  cmnky: functor ... mbox and maildir are the 2 standards i know of ... but im no mail expert
11:42  IanWizard: quick way to find the fs type of a file/partition?
11:42  Psi-Jack: man file
11:42  Psi-Jack: IanWizard: ^
11:42  Psi-Jack: And it's filesystem, neither file nor partition.
11:43  lesshaste: in okular, how do you add an annotation? I have exported it as a document archive but I just can't see the option to add an annotation
11:43  IanWizard: Psi-Jack: I don't see anything relevant in the  file man,  and I tried file earlier, all I got was "data"
11:44  Psi-Jack: Read the manpage further.
11:44  jargon-: i've got an HP ProCurve 2650 switch. i want each port to accept traffic only from one specific device. anybody have any ideas?
11:45  Psi-Jack: jargon-: ##networking
11:45  IanWizard: Psi-Jack: -s ?  is that what I'm supposed to find?
11:45  mAniAk-_-: port security with either sticky and max one or static one
11:45  mAniAk-_-: mac addresses that is
11:45  Psi-Jack: IanWizard: Ta-Da!
11:45  jargon-: Psi-Jack: u're sending me to the most unresponsive channel on freenode? :*-(
11:46  Psi-Jack: jargon-: No, I'm sending you to the channel where your question is on-topic as this has nothing to do with Linux, at all.
11:46  Psi-Jack: HP Procurve's don't use Linux.
11:46 * jargon- sighs
11:46  CoolCoder: How do i make a subdomain on ubuntu vps server?
11:46  lewellyn: Psi-Jack: not true. i saw one that nmap said ran linux! ;)
11:46  IanWizard: Psi-Jack: I used that and got "data", but I know it is a partition (it's an img of the partition from dd)
11:46  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: Call your VPS provider and ask.
11:47 * Psi-Jack beats lewellyn over the head and drags him to a cave to lock back up.
11:47  cmnky: jargon-, ebtables will filter raw ethernet packets ... which would work on your switch assuming each port had a linux box connected to it ;)
11:47  Psi-Jack: cmnky: YOu can take it to ##networking with him.
11:48  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: My question is to find the way to do myself. I know VPS provider can do everything which wont help to understand things. For your answer why i need to come here?
11:48  cmnky: Psi-Jack, i answered with a linux solution tho ;)
11:48 * Psi-Jack glares.
11:48  Psi-Jack: Suppose so, but completely against his own question. ;p
11:49  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: Well, obviously you don't know anything of what you're doing, and should probably start googling up correct terminology.
11:49  CoolCoder: :P
11:49  cmnky: Psi-Jack, but still informative to all the linux users in the channel ;)
11:50  cmnky: Psi-Jack, maybe he'll toss his switch and get a linux box with 4 quad port nics ;)
11:51  Psi-Jack: I doubt it.
11:51  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: Terminology :P .. IRC is for beginners ea? Experts will find solution by themself ;;) googled already
11:51  Psi-Jack: ProCurve's are awesome switches.
11:51  Psi-Jack: CoolCoder: IRC? Beginners? No, books and google are for beginners.
11:51  cmnky: and quad port nics are expensive
11:51  scp1: Beginners? Google? right
11:51  Psi-Jack: IRC is for somewhat at least reasonably educated people.
11:53  CoolCoder: Psi-Jack: Excuse. let me run bookstore get some books and google!! thanks
11:53  shadowmaster: 1/47
11:54  cmnky: <-- reading the online asterisk book he googled for
11:56  lolcat: Is there a way to make ssh reconnect if the connection is lost?
11:57  sauvin: lolcat, you looking for autossh?
11:58  loomsen: while :; do ssh user@host; done
11:58  lolcat: sauvin: I've never done it, but it seams like something that makes sence
12:00 * sauvin waits for autossh to finish installing so he can read its man page
12:01  sauvin: autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it
12:01  sauvin:      as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic.
12:01  sauvin: (from the man page)
12:01 * loomsen waits for some snow to finally start falling
12:02  sauvin: Too early in the year for snow to last.
12:02  opalepatrick: I am getting a red padlock next to an apache-modules update in Mandriva software update gui - is this a Mandriva peculiarity and why? It appears to install but remains there.
12:03  loomsen: sauvin: not over here :)
12:03  sauvin: Where's "over here"?
12:03  loomsen: sauvin: all over germany
12:03  sauvin: Ah.
12:04  sedulous: it didn't last in berlin yet :(
12:04  loomsen: we have like 5cms over here in hamburg
12:04  Xunie: What is suggested for measuring performance of subroutines, just clock_gettime()? If so, what clock will more likely give me the highest precision? (Note: I'd like to be POSIX compliant.)
12:04  loomsen: but the forecast predicted snow for the afternoon
12:04  sauvin: I would imagine you have more than a few cms in high Alpine passes now :D
12:04  sedulous: some snow would lighten up the slightly depressing gray mood of the city in the winter
12:05  loomsen: sedulous: i bet, i dont like berlin very much
12:05  lolcat: sauvin: That seams what I need. If my VPS goes down, I want it to reopen the cnnection.
12:05  sauvin: Xunie, you're developing something in BCPL? ISO Pascal? Algol? RPG-II? Dot Net?
12:06  lolcat: sauvin: Thanks
12:06  Xunie: sauvin, C++
12:06  cmnky: Xunie, gettimeofday() works for wall clock times, if you just want some rough estimate of elapsed time for a function you can iterate in a loop enough times to get an accurate amortized result
12:06 * sedulous only uses Intercal
12:06  Xunie: cmnky, I'd still like to be precise on the millisec though.
12:07  cmnky: Xunie, run it 1000 times, divide by 1000 ... you'll get millisecs ;)
12:07  sauvin: I don't know anything about C++, but believe that sub-millisecond timing is possible in languages like Perl by including Time::HiRes.
12:07  cmnky: Xunie, short of amortization tricks ... you might check out the kernel profiling stuff ... never looked into it myself
12:08  Xunie: sauvin, C++ is just bloated C.
12:08  sauvin: This much I already knew, but can't tell you how to use it :D
12:08  cmnky: Xunie, you might also be able to find a package to instrument a library ... so you can just run it and get a result, sort of like how gnu profiler works
12:09  sedulous: Do you know some kind of meta daemon software? It should be able to start and monitor processes, e.g. n * OpenVPN instances. Kind of like sysvinit but more versatile and with configuration options that are suitable for more than 1 copy of a daemon.
12:10  Diverdude: Does eps support anything else than vector graphics?
12:10  cmnky: sedulous, process watcher daemons exist ... don't know any names ottomh though
12:10  sedulous: cmnky: yeah, i figured that there _has_ to be something
12:11  sedulous: i vaguely recall one written by the author of qmail
12:11  cmnky: google linux "process watcher"
12:11  sauvin: start-stop-daemon (8) - start and stop system daemon programs
12:11  sedulous: but if it's anything like qmail, i don't want it :P
12:11  cmnky: the kernel also has hangcheck timer api
12:11  noisemaker: monit can do it
12:11  cmnky: not sure if it works on individual processes .. but i seem to recall it does
12:12  apsinvo: Hi - how can I find out the real path to the program if I have it's pid? ps aux is showing a 'fake' name
12:12  sedulous: thanks noisemaker & sauvin
12:12  Wulf: /proc/<pid>/exe
12:12  cmnky: apsinvo, you could try "man lsof"
12:13  apsinvo: Ty Wulf, cmnky
12:13  cmnky: i seem to recall, the process itself, does not know the true path to its binary
12:13  cmnky: it only gets the command line as args
12:18  cmnky: alright ... gotta get to bed before the sun comes up .. night all
12:21  lewellyn: Diverdude: while i don't see how this is linux-related, an eps can contain (almost) anything which can be represented by postscript.
12:21  Diverdude: lewellyn, also raster graphics?
12:21  lewellyn: Diverdude: google://postscript+raster
12:29  xpyman: it seems that gnome didn't get my current home variable), is there any way around this ?
12:29  xpyman: * I can't currently access my home directory defined on etc.passwd and I don't have root privileges. I was able to login and I'm currently using a tmp/home-xxx folder, but I'm not able to start firefox
12:30  bocaneri: xpyman, what distro are you using?
12:30  xpyman: bocaneri openSUSE
12:31  bocaneri: This, of course, is openSUSE 10.0?
12:31  Inst|Netbook: does anyone own a clickpad?
12:31  Inst|Netbook: does anyone know how a clickpad works?
12:31  xpyman: bocaneri I get an error like this: Could not create per-user gnome configuration directory `/export/home/my-username`, where /export/home/my-username is my "default" home folder
12:33  xpyman: bocaneri: hmmm, it's openSUSE 11.2
12:33  p0op-: I have a rhel server, which can copy to one host at 15mb/s but copy to another at only 70kb/s, both on the same vlan. Anybody know why this could be?
12:34  bocaneri: xpyman, are you certain you logged in as "my-username"?
12:35  bocaneri: p0op-, if you have rhel, do you not also have rhel support?
12:35  xpyman: bocaneri: yes. The source of the problem is that my home folder is located on a NFS server, but it's currently down
12:35  bocaneri: xpyman, and you said you can't edit /etc/passwd?
12:35  iomari: anyone know which package has libppl_c.so.4?
12:36  xpyman: bocaneri: Nope, no root privileges. The sysadmin is trying to solve this problem
12:36  bocaneri: Until your sysadmin fixes NFS because your home directory is on some remote machine, I fear you're boned.
12:37  bocaneri: iomari, you're using minix, right? Or OpenSolaris, one of the BSDs or maybe ReactOS?
12:37  xpyman: bocaneri: I was able to get to the desktop using a console login and exporting a home variable, but gnome is still trying to access my default home folder
12:38  iomari: bocaneri, nope, suse
12:38  iomari: bocaneri, trying to install gcc-ada
12:38  bocaneri: iomari, you may be better off asking that question in a suse channel.
12:38  iomari: bocaneri, ok, thanks
12:39  bocaneri: xpyman, you exported a HOME variable in a shell and then did the startx thing?
12:39  xpyman: bocaneri: yep
12:40  bocaneri: Too many things can go wrong with that; the standard libraries are full of get* things that bypass the shell :\
12:41  xpyman: bocaneri: Yeah, I imagined that. I tried solving this problem via gconftool, but there doesn't seem to be a home variable defined in there :/
12:41  Mion: iomari: suse has a file search thingy hidden on their pages somewhere
12:41  iomari: Mion, yes, im on it. thanks
12:44  n13z: ehlo
12:44  apsinvo: helo hi
12:47  xpyman: bocaneri: well, thanks for the help, I'll try to solve this issue, but I guess I'll just have to stick to konqueror for now... anyway, thanks, and bye !

13:52  blip-: hi all, a bit off topic but if anyone has info please share: I'm trying to make an *offline tool for my own use* that translates text using Google Translate.  I made a simple html/javascript page to use the G Translate API - there is one problem though... they need me to sign up for an API key and give a URL... I don't have a URL i'm just running it in my browser on my computer... what can I do ?   http://code.google.com/apis/loader/signup.html     thank
13:52  blip-: s
13:52  nicesj: commonly people said "applet" as a java application which is running on the browser, some part in a page.. hehe..
13:54  nicesj: blip- / if your machine is connected on the internet, just implement your own web server using private port..
13:54  nicesj: blip- / so generate a simple text page and give that page back to the google's translator.
13:55  nicesj: blip- / http://yourIP:yourPrivatePort/dummyTextFile
13:56  nicesj: blip- / if you give this URL back to the google, he(she) will try to access your server then feed your dummy page back to it.
13:56  nicesj: how about this?
13:57  nicesj: does it makes any sense?
13:57  blip-: nicesj, ah I see. In that sense I do have some domain names from work I can use... but will the software only run on that machine ?
13:57  nicesj: you don't need to get your own domain name,
13:57  blip-: nicesj, I mean will google require the html/javascript to run from that domain at each translation request
13:58  blip-: ye I guess I don't understand the purpose of them asking for a URL

14:31  rascal999: can i program a PIC using a VGA interface with the VGA port on a linux box?
14:32  gordboy: rascal999: almost certainly not. why do you ask ?
14:34  rascal999: i have a pcb w
14:34  rascal999: *i have a pcb with vga interface, i bought a usb to serial for it but it's not compatible
14:34  rascal999: i'm surprised you can't do that
14:35  gordboy: no offence, but you are a complete idiot. now kindly take your stupidity elsewhere
14:38  Angel-SL: hey um

14:41  mrcarrot: in debian i have problem with xdg creating two Desktop folders... one in english and one in swedish. the swedish one is ignored by kde
14:41  gordboy: Angel-SL: no, of course not
14:41  mrcarrot: and the english one is used regardless of what is in .config
14:42  gordboy: Angel-SL: you can't cd to a file
14:42  mrcarrot: the english desktop folder is also reappearing if i delete it

14:47  Fogger: If I am a long-term windows user who wishes to move to Linux, what distro would you recommend?
14:48  gjvc: fogger, fire up virtualbox and try a few for yourself.  fedora 14 is pretty good though, and might suit you :-)
14:48  ananke: Fogger: try a few. fedora, ubuntu, opensuse
14:48  lautriv: Fogger, basically you can use any distro, biggest difference is package-management. what will you do with the machine (office/server/etc)
14:49  SolomonKull: Linux Mint, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE are the most new-user friendly.
14:49  SolomonKull: In my opinion.
14:49  lautriv:  and 2 of them aren't save on your valueable data
14:49  Fogger: well, I'm scared I wont be able to play my games, ie Steam etc  but I am also  learning c++
14:50  p0op-: how do i load an alias dynamically in /etc/modprobe.conf on rhel?
14:50  p0op-: without rebooting
14:50  ananke: Fogger: then why even consider a 'move'? you can use both
14:51  Fogger: This virtualbox idea is great, I'll play with it & see where I go from there, thanks :)
14:52  gjvc: fogger, you'll have more fun playing with linux than most retail games :-D
14:52  Fogger: is VirtualBox the best method, or just the free method?
14:52  gjvc: fogger, yup, we use it at our local unix workshop for newbs
14:52  gjvc: free
14:56  gordboy: Fogger: virtualbox is very very good. i use it a lot, and have no hesitation in recommending it. whether oracle are a worthy/honourable company or not, is another matter
14:56  Fogger: gordboy: virtualbox it is, thanks.
14:57  Fogger: any company that remains opensource cant be that bad, can it? :D
15:00  Angel-SL: gordboy: oops, missed that.
15:00  Angel-SL: heheh
15:00  Angel-SL: anyway
15:00  Angel-SL: what's the best way to upsize an ext(2/3) partition on a headless remote server?
15:01  lautriv: Angel-SL, best way is always backup/recreate.
15:01  ananke: Angel-SL: and next time use lvm, rather than partitions :)
15:05  lautriv: or even better raid.
15:06  ananke: uhmm, what does raid have to do with his problem?
15:06  lautriv: ananke, he could hot-add instead use another layewr for badly planned jbod :-)
15:11  ananke: lautriv: that would still require resizing partitions
15:12  Fogger: why is 32bit Ubuntu recommended over 64?
15:12  ananke: Fogger: by whom?
15:12  Fieldy: i hadn't heard that it is
15:12  Fogger: ananke: official download page
15:12  Fogger: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
15:13  ananke: ohh, weird
15:13  Rotwang: hello
15:13  tyche: Fogger: Because most of the people downloading Ubuntu are n00bies to Linux and/or don't know whether or not they have 64 bit capability.
15:14  Rotwang: Is anyone aware of a gpl cad software for linux that supports .dwg files?
15:14  Fogger: 64bit still runs 32bit apps no problem then?
15:14 * Fieldy facepalms
15:15  lautriv: ananke, sure b/c the plan was false anyway. i referred this to "next time"
15:15  tyche: Rotwang: Nope.  .dxf is the closest you'll get, and with the way AutoCAD kept changing it, it's not really very useful.
15:17  Rotwang: tyche: ok, thanks
15:17  tyche: You're welcome

15:20  kneuts: so, I'm trying to find the definition for getpid() in the kernel source, but I can't seem to find it.

15:21  usr13: what does it mean when ping returns "Time to live exceeded"?
15:22  sllide: for a whole time i was thinking about a netcat app but client mode
15:22  sllide: it took me 2 hours to realize thats telnet
15:22  lautriv: usr13, you ran over more hops than TTL was set
15:30  Bartzy: is it possible to get the quarter of the year with date ? meaning 1.1-31.3 is quarter 1.. 1.4-31.6 is quarter 2...
15:30  apsinvo: i dont think so
15:31  apsinvo: Write a script
15:31  gordboy: june has 30 days btw
15:35  Mion: Bartzy: fairly easy to script
15:36  gordboy: kneuts: a very good way of dealing with source trees is id-utils. "mkid" makes a database, and "lid" searches it. you could always use grep -R or something too
15:36  jimbauwens: I have set up openvpn, but I cannot access the web through it. Has anyone here setup a vpn using openvpn? If so, maybe you could help me :)
15:37  Fieldy: jimbauwens: give #openvpn or the openvpn-users mailing list a try
15:38  jimbauwens: oh, great, they have a irc channel. Thanks :)
15:39  lautriv: jimbauwens, the vpn creates a virtual subnet via tun, to access the web you need a gateway on the other side.
15:41  jimbauwens: I tried forwarding eth1 to tun0, but didn't work. I'm now going to ask the openvpn guys for help. Thanks anyway
15:42  Fieldy: shrug, he didn't try what was suggested, i'm done
15:42  Fieldy: being as i have openvpn up and running in that way, what i said is how i figured it out.
15:43  jimbauwens: I don't mean to be rude...
15:44  jimbauwens: Or maybe i'm misunderstanding all you guys :)
15:45  apocn: Hello, I'm trying to have freeradius and isc-dhcp working together in order to dynamically associate different types of clients to different ip pools, has anyone worked with a similar setup?.
15:49  kneuts: gordboy: thanks for the tip, that's actually pretty darn useful.  I still can't seem to find the bloody definition.
15:49  kneuts: gordboy: all I've got is the prototype in syscalls.h
15:50  gordboy: Bartzy: case $(date +%m) in 1|2|3) echo first ; ;; 4|5|6) echo second ; ;; 7|8|9) echo third ; ;; 10|11|12) echo fourth ; ;; esac

15:57  rioch: I have a server setup with encrypted lvm. The problem is, this server is headless. Is there a way to remotely connect during the boot process in order to enter the password?
16:04  EdwardIII: rioch, i'd imagine without vnc/ssh you're going to need some kind of kvm hardware
16:05  rioch: I read something about a serial console, is that possible or does that require wires?
16:05  EdwardIII: i don't know a great deal about that but i imagine it required plugging into a serial port
16:06  EdwardIII: sorry, all imagination no hard facts!
16:07  apsinvo: rioch;
16:07  apsinvo: If it already has a line over the serial port, then yes, you could use that
16:09  rioch: apsinvo, a line over the what what?
16:09  rioch: :)
16:11  mAniAk-_-: rioch: youll need a terminal server of some sort which you can connect to remotely
16:12  Tjololo12: hey, I just tried to start vmware workstation and it said a module wasn't loaded. What is the command to load modules again?

16:18  Nibble: does a intellimouse explorer 3.0 work with linux?
16:24  EdwardIII: heh grawity... tmux troubles?
16:25  grawity: EdwardIII: It froze in a strange way. Whatever I typed, the screen would not update until I switched to another tmux window.
16:25  grawity: And there I was thinking "I should switch from screen" :/
16:25  EdwardIII: heh
16:25  EdwardIII: i'm installing tmux now, never used it before
16:27  crocket: With "hdparm -t /dev/vgserver/data", I get 126.72MB/sec read speed.
16:28  crocket: With "hdparm -t /dev/mapper/cryptdata", I get 26.21MB/sec read speed.
16:28  crocket: The default encryption of LUKS decreases read performance by a factor of about 4.83.
16:28  crocket: Do you guys think 26.21MB/s is acceptable?
16:28  Obvious: faster than flash thumbdrives, lol
16:28  lautriv: crocket, it's your time mot ours.
16:29  lautriv: *not
16:29  crocket: lautriv, anyway
16:29  Obvious: what was you going to store there?
16:29  crocket: lautriv, I wasn't trying to generalize my result.
16:29  sedulous: there are USB 2.0 flash thumbdrives that slightly exceed 26.21 MB/s :P
16:29  rioch: Are all filesystems at the same time during boot?
16:29  rioch: *mounted
16:30  lautriv: rioch, in order of fstab
16:30  EdwardIII: grawity, weeeell, tmux has a sensible default for the hardstatus
16:30  sedulous: crocket: take into account that the access time does not suffer as much by far
16:30  rioch: lautriv, and all of this is prior to the login prompt?
16:30  crocket: sedulous : what do you mean?
16:30  Obvious: rioch, yes
16:30  crocket: access time itself doesn't provide a reliable reference point.
16:31  lautriv: rioch, at least / and those set to auto and beeing present
16:31  sedulous: crocket: encryption affects the throughput of hard drives but only slightly the access time
16:31  crocket: sedulous, throughput is important
16:31  rioch: Obvious, so even if I only encrypt a couple of partitions, I'm still gonna get a prompt for the password?
16:31  crocket: sedulous, But thanks for the info
16:31  sedulous: i.e. if you use it on a system disk, the system won't feel 20% slower
16:31  grawity: EdwardIII: I think of it this way: "tmux can do a statusbar and Xterm title at the same time" (I use screen's "hardstatus" functionality to set the terminal window's titlebar)
16:32  sedulous: err, *as if it was running at 20% speed
16:32  EdwardIII: grawity, yeah, i like it!
16:32  lautriv: rioch, only if they mount fine and don't miss a possible fsck, otherwise you'll end in rescue
16:32  sveinse: I have a command returning "/dev/something   bla bla"  How can I use sed to remove the whitespace and the following bla bla?
16:33  crocket: hmm
16:33  SingAlong: how do i make linux show up as a disk drive when connected to another computer via usb?
16:33  crocket: According to "hdparm -t", LVM seems to increase throughput of HDDs.
16:33  crocket: LVM for the win
16:33  rioch: SingAlong, which os?
16:33  crocket: LVM increases throughput by 20~30MB/s
16:33  crocket: It's a serious increase
16:33  SingAlong: rioch: you mean the linux distro? or the os to which the linux comp is connected to?
16:33  ananke: SingAlong: first, you have to have special cable for that.
16:34  rioch: SingAlong, the os of the computer you are connected the usb drive to.
16:34  SingAlong: making the distro for a tablet. So the OS the user connects to could be anything.
16:35  rioch: SingAlong, then the solution could also be anything.
16:35  lautriv: sveinse, 's/^\([^ ]\+\).*/\1/'
16:35  SingAlong: rioch: oh. any pointers as to where i can find info about this?
16:35  rioch: SingAlong, yeah, you tried the Internet yet?
16:35  sveinse: lautriv: Thanks
16:36  SingAlong: rioch: yes sir.
16:36  rioch: SingAlong, I guess you're stuck then.
16:37  rioch: heh I think he misunderstood my initial question.
16:38  rioch: I wanted to know the tablet os. oops.
16:38  ananke: rioch: linux
16:38  ananke: he was making a linux distro to run on a tablet
16:38  rioch: ahhh then he needs to look at fstab and mount.
16:39  ananke: rioch: uhmm, you're still failing to see what he was trying to accomplish. he didn't want to mount things on it. he wanted to export its storage as usb mass storage
16:39  sveinse: In bash I have a variable returned from a command var=`some command`. It returns two values separated by space. How can I extract or index these values?
16:40  rioch: ananke, he wanted the tablet to BE the usb drive?
16:40  ananke: rioch: yes
16:40  rioch: ananke, well if the host os is linux, that's still mount/fstab
16:41  ananke: rioch: you're not grasping the concept at all. mount/fstab won't export anything
16:41  grawity: sveinse: I think this will be easiest: read -r foo bar <<< "$var"
16:41  rioch: ananke, mount/fstab on the system he's plugging the tablet into
16:41  grawity: sveinse: $foo will contain everything up to the first space
16:42  rioch: ananke, assuming the tablet hardware allows access to the drives through the usb cable
16:42  rioch: ananke, he could have a problem if the hardware doesn't support it
16:42  ananke: rioch: again, he's talking about enabling such functionality on the OS that runs on the tablet
16:42  grawity: sveinse: alternatively, ${var## *} and ${var%* }
16:43  rioch: ananke, interesting problem. How does android do it?
16:43  ananke: rioch: that was what he was trying to figure out
16:44  ananke: only block storage emulation i've worked with is related to network protocols: iscsi, aoe, fc over ip, etc
16:44  rioch: I imagine they have some sort of service, like NFS to do the export.
16:44  grawity: sveinse: here, bookmark those: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/ http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ
16:48  sveinse: grawity: Thanks

17:43  karthick87: reisio: Nautilus
17:43  grawity: lolcat: 1) Add more 'Listen' directives to sshd_config

17:44  grawity: Range of ports?
17:44  lolcat: yes
17:44  lolcat: 8000-10000
17:44  grawity: uh, that's ... how in the world would it be useful to listen on two thousand ports?
17:44  grawity: *Two* ports, I can understand.
17:45  lolcat: So I can ssh tunnel some to my vps without disturbing it
17:45  lolcat: Besides, my firewall blocks all ports, so they are all a waste
17:45  grawity: lolcat: wait, I don't understand. How is that related to SSH tunnels?
17:46  reisio: karthick87: hit F5
17:46  karthick87: reisio: Tried that
17:46  lolcat: grawity: I need to acces my server behind a firewall. To do that I need a ssh-tunnel, reverse something, so then I need to ssh -D 8000 (because I need port 22 to acces my vps, and it is busy).

18:00  karthick87: sedulous: Sorry i have no idea on using nmap.Can you help me
18:01  nightwalk: sveajobb: use mtr to rule out a network bottleneck
18:01  sveajobb: salparadise, how would I check that?  it started happening just right now btw
18:01  sedulous: karthick87: have you at least tried to read nmap's well-written manual?
18:01  salparadise: sveajobb: packet capture with tshark or tcpdump
18:01  [cannibalera]: someone has used? I am struggling to configure it as Centos identifies the modem as a CD-ROM
18:02  [cannibalera]: someone has used 3G modem in Linux? I am struggling to configure it as Centos identifies the modem as a CD-ROM
18:02  [cannibalera]: Ouvir

18:02  sedulous: [cannibalera]: possibly a hint in the right direction: http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/ -- some USB mobile broadband adapters act like 2 different USB devices
18:03  karthick87: sedulous: Yep i have tried this nmap --osscan-limit
18:03  sedulous: karthick87: try #nmap
18:04  sveajobb: salparadise, any pointers what I should look at. I get ALOT of connections and requests on port 80 (as I expected) but no kind of error messages
18:05  sveajobb: and these bastards "Neighbour table overflow." are alarming (from dmesg)
18:05  salparadise: sveajobb: yeah I think I had that before, is usually some arp related thing
18:06  sveajobb: salparadise, wow.. arp -an shows ALOT of addresses :) all on the same mac
18:06  compgenius999: hey guys, if i'm resizing an LVM logical volume, do I need to resize the filesystem on it first?
18:07  sveajobb: yeah.. I can see I have an idiotic netmask....
18:07  salparadise: sveajobb: sounds like is proxy arping
18:07  Fiver: compgenius999: if you're shrinking it
18:07  salparadise: are all the addresses on the same network?
18:08  sveajobb: salparadise, dont ask me why, but my netmask is 255.0.0.0 and all addresses are 83.*
18:08  salparadise: hmm, doesn't sound like good network design
18:09  sveajobb: no :) I'm about to change the netmask but I'm afraid that the default gw will drop out if I do that
18:11  catadoxas: is there any usefull screenrecording software for linux? as in capture the screen as a video?
18:11  sveajobb: I seriously don't get this.. I'm a slackware man myself so I must confess the debian configure files are not part of my nature but still.. if I have   iface eth0 inet static address ...... netmask ....  (... )   wouldn't that setup the correct netmask? why is my interface 255.0.0.0 atm
18:11  salparadise: sveajobb: meh, don't worry about it, clear all your arp entries
18:12  vendion: Is there a way to list all large files in a filesystem?  I need to figure out what is filling up my filesystem
18:12  marduk: vendion: what i usually do is du -max /filesystem | sort -nr ... or something like that
18:13  reisio: vendion: what DE?
18:13  EugenA: how can i find out, where should i apply the patch?
18:13  hektik: i have a question. im using proftpd. and i want to add users to my box, but i want them all to have access to the safe folder when using ftp
18:13  hektik: same*
18:13  EugenA: in the same dir with the patched file?
18:14  EugenA: does it matter?
18:14  sveajobb: salparadise, any way to clear entire table ant not specific entries?
18:14  reisio: EugenA: look at the patch, it should be obvious
18:14  vendion: reisio: No DE running in init 3 as it is a server
18:15  reisio: vendion: ah, yeah then du & sort
18:15  EugenA: reisio: i opened it, what should i look at?
18:15  salparadise: sveajobb: arp -an | perl -wlne 'print $1 if /\((.*)\)/' | xargs -i arp -d {}
18:16  EugenA: i see index: [filename]
18:17  sveajobb: salparadise, I'm afraid that didn't quite work. the list is full again. I need to fix the netmask
18:17  reisio: EugenA: --- ?
18:17  aljosa: i have a big folder (~75GB) filled with 1kb files and i need to delete folder or everything inside. rm -rf big_folder would take a long time and occupy cpu, any suggestions on howto remove big_folder fast?
18:17  EugenA: --- [filename]
18:18  vendion: marduk reisio: Thanks, running it now
18:18  JPT: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<device with folder>?
18:18  JPT: might be faster
18:18  hektik: i have a question. im using proftpd. and i want to add users to my box, but i want them all to have access to the safe folder when using ftp
18:19  toader: Hi, could anybody help me? when i use ssh myserver commnand, the ssh does execute .bashrc.
18:20  reisio: hektik: wasn't technically a question :D
18:21  reisio: toader: help you with what?
18:21  hektik: how can i make proftpd make users goto the same folder for ftp access?
18:21  reisio: EugenA: same dir, then
18:23  toader:  when i use ssh myserver "thecommand", the ssh does not execute .bashrc, could anybody help me?
18:23  aljosa: JPT: just testing, never used dd to delete file/folder. something like "dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/aljosa/tmp/fff/" should remove fff folder?
18:24  ^Rehan: toader: sshd installl ?
18:25  reisio: toader: what makes you think it should?
18:25  nightwalk: catadoxas: vnc2swf
18:26  aljosa: JPT:  is there some way i can use a folder for "of=" instead of device?
18:26  JPT: that was a troll advice
18:26  JPT: it'll probably wipe your hdd
18:26  reisio: catadoxas: recordmydesktop
18:26  JPT: rm -rf is the fastest i know
18:26  JPT: except you can run a hexeditor on your hdd and delete the inodes yourself ;)
18:27  _wired: hey guys, can anyone help me out with a sed regex to replace something like: value="???" (whereby ??? is any character not "). "???" is to be replaced into, say, "blah"
18:27  aljosa: JPT: 8-)
18:27  JPT: ^^
18:27  sveajobb: damn... my servers are having a hard time coping.. they are dying
18:29  zok: I've got a bit of a stupid situation here, maybe someone can offer some ideas
18:30  zok: I need to grep all the .php and .pl files (recursively) in a directory
18:30  zok: For a certain bit of text
18:30  zok: And output the file(s) that contain it
18:30  sveajobb: IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:30:48:8e:8d:da:00:24:c4:c0:b7:00:08:00 SRC=80.91.250.222 DST=83.140.28.14 LEN=56 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=250 ID=0 PROTO=ICMP TYPE=11 CODE=0 [SRC=83.140.28.14 DST=109.224.28.233 LEN=48 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=1 ID=15850 PROTO=TCP INCOMPLETE [8 bytes] ]
18:30  zok: Anyone know of a way to do that?
18:31  sveajobb: anyone knows what the "TCP INCOMPLETE [8 bytes]" part means? it looks disturbin
18:31  _wired: sveajobb: nothing to worry about, its just fragmented packets
18:31  karthick87: How to use grep command?
18:31  nightwalk: _wired: 's/value=".*"/value="replacement"/g'
18:32  sveajobb: _wired, well I am worrying because it's causing trouble on my servers.. I can't be sure that's the cause ofcourse but if I go to http://adoperator.com it loads everything just fine, but then it halts "trying to download the rest"
18:32  _wired: sveajobb: where are u getting that line from? a firewall? a router?
18:32  nightwalk: _wired: '.' matches any character, and the * after it tells it to match any number of characters up to the next "
18:32  lautriv: zok, grep -r foo /thefolder | cut -d ':' -f1
18:33  _wired: thanks nightwalk, trying to digest it now :P regex is messy. but with sed is WAY messier =/
18:33  sveajobb: _wired, from the actual server hosting the domain I mentioned above. It has some firewalling aswell, I log inproper packets
18:34  Tjololo12: karthick87: man grep
18:34  sveajobb: _wired, could you go to that domain please and check if it "hangs" for you? hopefully there is just something wrong with my local internet
18:34  nightwalk: _wired: like any other language, it just takes a little practice ;)
18:35  zok: lautriv: how do I make it ONLY do that for .php or .pl files?
18:35  karthick87: Tjololo12: For example i want to show my ip address using grep command..How do it?
18:35  zok: There's a bunch of giant .txt files that are making it take forever
18:35  _wired: nightwalk, uh ooh, i think your regex was set to "greedy" instead of "lazy". how do i change that?
18:35  lautriv: zok, punch a find before
18:35  _wired: nightwalk: i.e, take nearest " instead of furthest "
18:36  _wired: sveajobb: works perfectly fine
18:36  Tjololo12: karthick87: ifconfig | grep addr shows all your addresses, but without interfaces. You'll have to do some playing if you just want your IP.
18:36  sveajobb: _wired, thanks for that :) then it must be something wrong with my net then *phew*
18:36  _wired: :)
18:36  zok: lautriv: not quite sure how that works? Wouldn't I have to use xargs or something?
18:37  lautriv: zok, whitespaces in filenames ?
18:37  zok: Yeah
18:37  zok: So I'll probably have to use print0 also
18:37  zok: Bah
18:37  lautriv: zok, then use find -someoption -exec
18:37  nightwalk: _wired: works for what you described anaict. Were you wanting to replace a fixed-length string or something?
18:38  Tjololo12: _wired: his regex was set to "global", it took all "
18:38  zok: ooo
18:38  _wired: Tjololo12: yea, it went all the way to the last " in the whole line
18:38  _wired: say for example the line has, value1="asdasd", value2="asasddddd", value3="aaa"
18:38  _wired: i was trying to manipulate value2
18:38  Tjololo12: that's why I hate regex...One character makes a HUGE difference.
18:38  _wired: but it ate up value 3 too
18:39  Tjololo12: it should have replaced all 3 I should think.
18:39  nightwalk: _wired: that's why I specified the 'value=' bit
18:40  _wired: ohhhhh
18:40  _wired: nightwalk: my bad. i was sleepy
18:40  nightwalk: I use 's///g' where ever possible, because it picks up stupid mistakes that I'd otherwise have missed
18:40  _wired: i only edited one part of it
18:40  _wired: hahahahaha
18:40  _wired: your regex's perfectly right
18:40  nightwalk: It also forces me to be as exact as possible in my regexes ;)
18:42  _wired: uhh, is there a good site to learn about sed regex? or a good tool?
18:42  _wired: i currently use RegexBuddy for php/perl regex'es, but cant seem to do sed's regex'es
18:43  loomsen: regextrainer.net
18:45  nightwalk: _wired: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-0
18:45  _wired: thanks loomsen and nightwalk . reading thru em now :D
18:49  flo`: hi
18:49  _wired: sveajobb: it doesnt hang?
18:49  flo`: is there a linux-c-function that can do a wildcard-match on filenames?
18:50  flo`: or would i need to read the whole filenamelist and do the matching myself?
18:50  cmnky: flo`, man glob
18:50  flo`: thank you
18:50  sveajobb: _wired, it works for me now aswell. and after changing the servers netmask I don't get the Neigbour table full anymore. although I get "write timed out" in lighttpd, but that might be normal
18:51  _wired: nightwalk: hmmm on more testing if i feed in something like: boo="baa" gee="123" value="xxxx" apple="orange" boom="lol"
18:52  _wired: and i do:  's/value=".*"/value="replacement"/g'
18:52  _wired: it becomes
18:52  _wired: boo="baa" gee="123" value="replacement"
18:52  _wired: apple="orange" and boom="lol" is lost
18:53  sveajobb: _wired, in java you would do .*?" , should be something like that in sed aswell I guess
18:54  nightwalk: No, it *should* work as written, actually...
18:54  _wired: yea, likewise in php.. .*? lemme see if i can find the equivalent.. lol
18:54  nightwalk: It doesn't work here either, though.
18:54  nightwalk: More interestingly, this doesn't work either: 's/value=".*"\(.*\)/value="replacement"\1/g'
18:55  _wired: does sed accept .*?
18:55  _wired: including the question mark
18:55  _wired: lol
18:55  nightwalk: What distro & version of sed are you using, _wired?
18:55  _wired: GNU sed version 4.1.5
18:55  _wired: some XenServer distro :D
18:56  _wired: based on CentOs
18:56  lautriv: nightwalk, the first .* is too greedy and will end at $
18:56  nightwalk: lautriv: Shouldn't, since there's a " before EOL
18:56  loomsen: sed  's|value="[[:alnum:]]"|value="replacement"|g'
18:56  loomsen: like lautriv said
18:56  loomsen: .* will end at $
18:57  nightwalk: I have *never* seen it do that. There has to be more to this than that
18:57  _wired: whoa, this is getting more advanced.
18:57  _wired: lol
18:58  sveajobb: well perhaps you should just do
18:58  sveajobb: [^"]*"  ?
18:58  lautriv: nightwalk, to stop at the quote you may use [^"]\+
18:58  sveajobb: epic "smurf" :)
18:59  _wired: btw, sed  's|value="[[:alnum:]]"|value="replacement"|g' doesnt get anything replaced...
18:59  nightwalk: Strange... this works: 's/value=".*" /value="replacement" /g'
18:59  nightwalk: All I did was include the trailing space
19:00  loomsen: nightwalk: well now you're matching the space also
19:00  _wired: loomsen: i tried with -r and -ri
19:00  _wired: and without
19:00  _wired: i mean, i tried with -r and without -r
19:00  _wired: lol
19:00  sveajobb: try this? 's/value=".*"\([^"]*\)/value="replacement"\1/g'
19:01  loomsen: _wired: echo 'boo="baa" gee="123" value="xxxx" apple="orange" boom="lol"' | sed  's|value="[[:alnum:]]"|value="replacement"|g'
19:01  loomsen: _wired: this works for me
19:02  _wired: sveajobb: sed: -e expression #1, char 46: invalid reference \1 on `s' command's RHS
19:02  sveajobb: sorry I did a crazy copy paste from an earlier message there.
19:02  tydeas: Hello ppl i am trying to mount a partition and can not get it working .
19:02  nightwalk: loomsen: still seems strange to me. As does your use of :alphanum: in your example. That doesn't catch a *ton* of characters. Is that a common xml constraint or something?
19:02  loomsen: nightwalk: no i just took the example
19:03  tydeas: I know this is not the much information but in /dev i only have sda and when i try to mount -t ntfs /dev/sda /media/dmtrs70/ i get error
19:03  loomsen: nightwalk: i dont know what he's trying to match actually
19:03  _wired: root@xenserver-test56 xapi]# echo 'boo="baa" gee="123" value="xxxx" apple="orange" boom="lol"' | sed  's|value="[[:alnum:]]"|value="replacement"|g'
19:03  _wired: boo="baa" gee="123" value="xxxx" apple="orange" boom="lol"
19:03  lautriv: tydeas, sda is the whole drive, did you have no partition ?
19:04  tydeas: lautriv: that's the strange i have at least 2 partitions
19:04  zok: lautriv: I'm using this: find -name \*.pl -exec grep 'PAGE' {} \;
19:04  zok: How do I get it to print the filename also?
19:04  tydeas: one ntfs and one the linux i am running at the moment.
19:04  _wired: loomsen: could it be sed's version?
19:04  nightwalk: loomsen: well, that's why I use '.*'. It matches everything, so it works for all data sets which don't have specific character restrictions
19:04  zok: It just prints the found text
19:04  solars: whats the easiest way to use a hsdpa usb modem under linux without gnome/kde or ubuntu?
19:04  lautriv: zok, try this --> find /somedir -name *.php -o -name *.pl -print | xargs grep foo | cut -d ':' -f1
19:05  sveajobb: _wired,  value=("[^"]+")  that matchin works according to http://www.regextrainer.net/
19:05  everythingWorks: hey
19:05  everythingWorks: how can i check the current version of my linux?
19:05  loomsen: uname -r
19:06  tydeas: lautriv: how else can i check instead of ls /dev ?
19:06  everythingWorks: loomsen
19:06  everythingWorks: thats the kernel version
19:06  everythingWorks: but not the os version
19:06  _wired: sveajobb: yep! works now :D
19:06  loomsen: everythingWorks: linux is your kernel
19:06  loomsen: everythingWorks: thats what you asked for
19:06  everythingWorks: yeah....
19:06  everythingWorks: and now the os version? :D

19:09  sveajobb: tydeas, to view the partitions you can do cfdisk /dev/sda
19:09  sveajobb: nightwalk,  :D
19:10  loomsen: nightwalk: we learned that .* matches everything ^^

20:42  cmnky: CharminTheMoose, moose man
20:43  Nibble: the 200 line patch that increases desktop responsivity, what kernel version is it going to be in?
20:44  GNU\colossus: .38, presumably
20:44  GNU\colossus: you can mimick its effects with little effort though
20:44  tydeas: if in cfdisk alter the boot from a device to an other and write it .. will i lost data?
20:44  go|dfish: by using BFS!
20:45  cmnky: wtf tydeas
20:46  ElectRo`: *sad pandas* that 200 lines of magic will get more attention then bfs
20:47  cmnky: what i want to know is ... why wasn't it already optimal ... and who do we throw eggs at
20:48  go|dfish: because it wont scale on my 20,480 core NUMA

20:48  sybariten: signs and stuff, that contain text
20:48  Nibble: hmm
20:48  cmnky: so amdahl gets the eggs then ... right
20:49  Nibble: BFS vs the normal scheduler shows that BFS is slower than normal scheduler for most stuff (phoronix)
20:49  Nibble: including higher latencies
20:49  Nibble: is there any truth to do
20:49  cmnky: sybariten, ah ... so you want to overlay enticeing sexually explicit messages designed to stimulate a product purchase over top of video
20:49  go|dfish: phoronix is also known as moronix
20:50  cmnky: sybariten, imagemagick might do that ... gimp has scriptable plugins as well
20:50  cmnky: sybariten, and you could also record flash sessions if you wanted
20:50  tydeas: I cfdisk see all the proper partitions sda1,sda2,sda3... ls /dev/sd* return only /dev/sda ... blkid not showing the partition after chkdsk
20:51  cmnky: sybariten, or just use flash to begin with, which i believe most video billboards actually do
20:51  resixian: what is it that causes /dev/ttyS* to be created despite a computer having no serial ports?
20:51  grawity: resixian: With no actual ports, it might still have the controller chips
20:52  cmnky: sybariten, i did a test app for a billboard project, using an embedded firefox window running flash scripts ... worked as a proof of concept
20:52  grawity: resixian: (check BIOS settings, if it's x86)
20:52  resixian: grawity: i checked, dmesg | grep tty shows nothing
20:52  resixian: grawity: if there were then there should be something in dmesg showing a device triggering the creation
20:53 --- _pg__ is now known as _pg_

20:53  resixian: ^ find this on a laptop that has serial ports, but nothing on one without
20:54  resixian: nevertheless dev/ttyS0-3 are still created on both
20:54  grawity: I wonder if "udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyS0 --query=all" would help
20:54  grawity: It might be hardcoded to udev rules too.
20:54  grawity: Hm, no. Udevadm doesn't help.
20:54  resixian: udev works from the other way though
20:54  resixian: like udev responds to the kernel finding device events right?
20:54  grawity: Do /dev/ttyS* have the same timestamp as other /dev nodes?
20:55  resixian: yes

20:57  resixian: lautriv: card reader yes, but thats not a 8250 device
20:58  lautriv: resixian, ttyS must not be 8250 but still serial
20:59  resixian: lautriv: at any rate, if it were associated it would show in `dmesg | grep ttyS`
20:59  resixian: ?
20:59  lautriv: resixian, i'm not entirely shure at that point if it's no module
20:59  resixian: i think this tty0-3 is some historical artifact: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-HOWTO-11.html
21:00  lautriv: -h
21:00  resixian: lautriv: even 'tty' shows up in dmesg as 'console'
21:01  Kre10s: Where are the docs for getting gtk to use cairo to display an svg graphic?
21:01  lautriv: grawity, does udev re-create old static entries ?
21:01  resixian: could those be the 'persistent' rules?
21:02  lautriv: resixian, grep -r /etc/udev ?
21:02  pingfloyd: resixian: what problem are you having tty devices?
21:02  resixian: pingfloyd: i want the extraneous ttyS* to go away
21:03  grawity: resixian: rm /dev/ttyS*
21:03  resixian: lautriv: http://pastie.org/1336244
21:04  resixian: grawity: that only works if i *know* there is not really a serial port there
21:04  pingfloyd: resixian: I don't think you can, those are pretty fundimental to basic operation
21:06  pingfloyd: oh wait, nevermind you said ttyS
21:06  pingfloyd: I was thinking you meant ttyn
21:06  cmnky: what up pingfloyd ... ltns
21:06  pingfloyd: in other words, you want to get rid of extraneous serial device nodes
21:08  pingfloyd: you could opt to just disable your serial ports in the bios

21:24  cmnky: resixian, ive not messed with much serial port code in linux .. .but checking for DTR can't be all that resource consuming
21:25  resixian: cmnky: its a lot consuming when the alternative would be say, time.sleep(30)
21:25  grawity: guampa: uh, but "mm.mm" is decimal and "mm ss" is base 60 (60 seconds in minute), you can't just sed it.
21:25  cmnky: explain, briefly, what you want to happen
21:25  Al_nz1: guampa close - it needs to remove the space between the "S" and the "36"
21:26  guampa: shades: run "env", theres a SSH_CONNECTION variable
21:26  resixian: cmnky: me?
21:26  cmnky: yeah
21:26  cmnky: you want to talk to some device ... when it gets plugged in ?
21:26  guampa: Al_nz1: then sed 's/^S \(.*,\)E\(.*\)$/-\1\2/g'
21:26  guampa: (with a space after ^S)
21:26  resixian: cmnky: right. possible more than one of the same type of device
21:26 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 158 seconds
21:27  Al_nz1: guampa I just added a space after ^S but as pointed out still needs some maths on the mintes
21:27  shades: guampa: like SSH_CONNECTION=x.x.x.x someport x.x.x.x 22 ?
21:27  cmnky: okay ... so single server, multiple serial ports, multiple devices ... correct ?
21:27  resixian: cmnky: yep
21:27  guampa: shades: yup
21:27  guampa: Al_nz1: kinda math?
21:27  shades: so I am sshed in then?
21:27  cmnky: with auto device plugged in go detection ?
21:27  resixian: cmnky: but waste no cycles checking these phantom serial ports
21:27  guampa: shades: surely
21:28  cmnky: wasteing / not wasting cycles for detection, is dependent upon the linux kernel serial port code
21:28  cmnky: which im about to go look at
21:28  cmnky: if you have to poll every x seconds ... you'll waste some cycles .. and that'll be as good as you can get without rewriting the linux serial port code
21:28  shades: wait
21:28  hetii: Hello :)
21:28  shades: but if i just ssh into it initially ssh_connection still shows up in env
21:28  shades: ;(
21:29  cmnky: but it'll only be a few cycles ... and it wont be any big deal
21:29  shades: this is confusing, because even if i'm just sshhed in one level deep it'll show up when I type env and also leave putty if I type in exit
21:29  hetii: did some of you had knowlade about this product? http://www.keepalived.org/LVS-NAT-Keepalived-HOWTO.html ?
21:29  Al_nz1: guampa ie 36 46.165 becomes 36 46 09.9  (.165 x 60 = 9.9)
21:30  cmnky: resixian, http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Serial-Programming-HOWTO/x56.html#AEN110
21:30  cmnky: resixian, 2.3.4 ... "Waiting for Input from Multiple Sources"
21:30  argos-void: knows somebody something about a status bar for console? (like conky but in console)
21:30  hetii: there are wrote: The realserver must not be on both the internal and external network, they must be on separate segements/LANs/VLANs.
21:31  guampa: Al_nz1: ah ok
21:31  guampa: gimme a min
21:31  cmnky: resixian, appears to be possible, using select()/poll()/epoll() ... so you don't have to waste cycles
21:31  Al_nz1: guampa I thin k you dont need to worry about the leading 0 in "09.9
21:31  hetii: so main question is can i use Keepalived on two real machine and also on this same machines had my real server there the service will work ?
21:31  resixian: cmnky: not sure if thats exposed in python, thanks for the tip

21:47  cmnky: resixian, but as i said ... you should have a "list of devices to check"
21:47  f00bar80: resixian, sorry i mean to extract all timestamp log's text ?
21:48  cmnky: resixian, the core problem lies in the fact that serial devices dont necessarily signal their presence ... use of DTR pin is optional
21:48  resixian: f00bar80: that what would be in the script right? using some combination of grep, cut, tr commands
21:49 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 146 seconds
21:49  resixian: cmnky: yes, and probably also why i shoul dabandon this daemonized approach to finding them
21:49  cmnky: resixian, well, you can solve that with a custom cable, that connects DTR to ground or +5 ( can't remember which )
21:50  cmnky: then your devices cable, would indeed signal its presence
21:50  resixian: no, because most computers don't even have db9 connectors anymore
21:50  resixian: and many usb-serial only give 3-wire connection anyway
21:50  cmnky: damn dude ... you make it all impossible when its in fact quite doable ;)
21:50  resixian: heh..
21:50  cmnky: use a device list
21:51  resixian: that requires users that are not idiots
21:51  cmnky: charge them for support
21:51  cmnky: and make it hard on purpose
21:51  resixian: i do in fact have a device list, btw
21:51  nrltd: Hi
21:52  nrltd: How do i remove all .name dirs/files from my dir recursively?
21:52  resixian: though some usb-serial give the full pinout, those are more expensive and becoming more rare
21:52  cmnky: resixian, make the default config file ... check all the common possibilities
21:53  cmnky: have a "max devices" number ... certainly they'll know how many devices they own
21:53  cmnky: when that number of attached devices is reached ... stop checking the other ports and kill the threads
21:54  resixian: i think i'll just make them push a button, 'find devices' and then kill the threads after a short time
21:54  cmnky: should a device go away, start checking them all again
21:54  resixian: yeah
21:54  cmnky: there you go ... "auto detect devices and write config file"
21:55  cmnky: and people accuse me of sweating the details ... sheesh ;)
21:55  resixian: yeah. i am using the config file to try and 're-guess' during the next launch
21:55  Al_nz1: guampa: any luck? I think a second pass using awk might be easier?
21:55  resixian: this is definitely i rabbit hole i should get out of..
21:55  guampa: Al_nz1: almost have it,
21:55  guampa: putting all the pieces together
21:55 * resixian stops hijacking channel with needless distraction...
21:56  pingfloyd: resixian: the reason udev is bringing up those nodes is because they are there. While you may not have the actual physical port, it is still there in the electronics.
21:56  cmnky: just detect a connected device, and instruct user to edit config file
21:56  resixian: pingfloyd: like on the bus?
21:56  cmnky: and allow for use of multiple ports/devices
21:56  pingfloyd: yeah
21:56  Nibble: that wourd be coor
21:56  pingfloyd: it's ubiquitous with PC design
21:57  resixian: i was wondering that.. it doesnt seem like hw mfg would leave extraneous stuff aroudn though?
21:57  Nibble: Linux needs a proper handling of RFC152186 specified error codes
21:57  pingfloyd: resixian: those are usually in the chipset themselves these days
21:57  Nibble: could anyone take a look at that?
21:57  pingfloyd: so there isn't any point in trying to remove them
21:57  cmnky: resixian, why make 4 serial port ic's ... with 1-4 ports .. when you can cram it all into the south bridge and let them leave pins disconnected ?
21:57  resixian: pingfloyd: 'what' is in the chipset though? the address?
21:57  pingfloyd: they're there, as to whether the manu wants to make use of them, they simply either add the interface or don't
21:58  resixian: if the pins were disconnected, then the kernel wouldnt' detect them?
21:58  cmnky: resixian, no ... because the port exists ... it just isnt connected
21:59  pingfloyd: resixian: super I/O chip
21:59  cmnky: and as explained ... there is no standard method of detecting a serial device ... DTR pin use is optional
21:59  pingfloyd: and in turn, if I'm not mistaken, the super I/O was pretty much integrated into the southbridge ages ago
22:00  cmnky: yes ... its all jammed into a stock i/c
22:00  pingfloyd: yeah, that's what matter
22:00  pingfloyd: which ic isn't so important
22:00  pingfloyd: resixian: the point is, that it would be extra work to get rid of it logically
22:01  pingfloyd: so they just simply either omit the rest of the electronics or include them
22:01  cmnky:  cat /proc/tty/driver/serial .. should direct you to which devices to not bother checking, at the very least
22:01  pingfloyd: like the serial ports themselves
22:01  cmnky: serial port logic IC space is miniscule
22:02  pingfloyd: it's not the only legacy aspect that is ubiquitous though
22:03  jeffmoss: anybody here use rackspace intensive for your hosting?
22:03  cmnky: its not much more than a timer and a flip flop ... electronics wise
22:04  cmnky: at least on the send side
22:04  pingfloyd: yeah, that's just ic evolution in general
22:04  pingfloyd: one ic handles what multiple ICs did and so on
22:04  pingfloyd: sets of chips become chipsets
22:04  pingfloyd: sets of chipsets become newer chipsets
22:04  guampa: Al_nz1: http://pastie.org/1336443
22:04  nightwalk: Is anyone here running fedora 12 by any chance? Can you mount nfs shares via 'mount -o udp' or similar?
22:05  cmnky: resixian, if you are worried about it ... make your mystery device connect to an arduino and connect the arduino via usb ... problem solved ;)
22:05  guampa: Al_nz1: probably not the most optimum, but it works with your example
22:05  guampa: (optimal? whathever)
22:06  Fieldy: nightwalk: perhaps you mean -t udf?
22:06  disgrntld: what does it mean when a file has an asterisk behind it when doing an `ls`?
22:07  nightwalk: No, google. French military VICTORIES
22:08  nightwalk: Fieldy: I have *no* idea how you could mistake udf with nfs over udp :/
22:11  Al_nz1: guampa ok trying now

22:17  Al_nz1: guampa do I have to save that code ot a file and bash it?
22:17  guampa: Al_nz1: you can run it directly, just replace "inputfile" with your filename
22:18  guampa: Al_nz1: needs bash

22:19  Al_nz1: guampa will it accept > outputfile.txt added on end?
22:19  guampa: Al_nz1: sure
22:19  milan: i though "Oh, an 'Intel'. That's a strong brand. It must be good. They make CPU-s afterall."
22:20  milan: later on i found the driver is even supported in the kernel, and I was happy, until today
22:21  Al_nz1: guampa hmmm, the latitues are fine, the first set of digits, but its cutting off the last set of converted digits
22:21  nightwalk: milan: btw, #wireless would probably be a better venue for that particular question ;)
22:22  jelly-home: milan: there's a separate driver effort for AP, http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipw2200-ap/
22:22  milan: yeah, i know, that just doesn't work
22:22  guampa: Al_nz1: pastebin a few lines of input and output
22:22  milan: won't even compile
22:24  Al_nz1: http://pastie.org/1336507
22:25  nightwalk: milan: my guess is you're either, 1) you're grabbing unstable dev code, or 2) you're missing build dependencies. Nothing you can do about the former, but you might try reading through the documentation to make sure it isn't the latter
22:25  GreenJim: hi everybody
22:25  Al_nz1: guampa note the "," on input blank lines - but I dont think thats the culprit
22:26  GreenJim: Al_nz1>
22:26  guampa: Al_nz1: no, the code works line by line
22:26 * nightwalk chuckles at the thought of an AP backed by an intel wifi card
22:26  gordboy: nightwalk: that's what i thought too. but the compile most definitely doesn't work
22:26  JonMarkGo: How would I do a recursive diff of 2 directories so that it shows all file differences of all files in the directory and all subdirectories?
22:28  nightwalk: gordboy: well...can't say I'm surprised. Dunno about their newest batch of wifi cards, but I've heard some many complaints of unexplained losses of connectivity with the past few generations that I've lost count
22:28  milan: nightwalk: are you sure? I was under impression that the Makefile is broken, later i read that even if I fix it, it won't compile on newer kernels, and even if a manage to make it compile (some guy claims he did) is will crash randomly (the guy on the internet says so)
22:29  gordboy: milan: stop fretting the source and/or Makefile is broken
22:30  nightwalk: ...which is particularly annoying, since they blame me for problems they brought upon themselves by buying bargain basement laptops. Which side is malfunctioning, I wonder? The Cisco APs, or the el-cheapo intel wifi cards. Hmmm....
22:30  GreenJim: JonMarkGo: diff (GNU diffutils) 2.8.1 has a --recursive option; did you already try it ?
22:31  gordboy: i quite often do that myself, i.e. automatically assume that people are idiots :)
22:31  pingfloyd: nightwalk: who is "they" that blames you?
22:31  Al_nz1: guampa is there a way to debug or setp through these lines?
22:31  guampa: well, it has three parts
22:32  nightwalk: pingfloyd: clients, of course. Richie-rich scrooge types, mostly. That makes it all the more annoying :/
22:32  guampa: semicolon delimited
22:32  Al_nz1: guampa yeah I can just follow whats happening
22:32  Al_nz1: three seperate seds
22:32  gordboy: but the ugly truth is that most punters with "questions" are as thick as the proverbial pig manure
22:32  Al_nz1: one for each set of coords
22:32  Al_nz1: then one to throw it back togetyher
22:32  guampa: Al_nz1: for a simple debugging try omitting the last part,the one that puts together the output string
22:32  JonMarkGo: GreenJim: I was trying -r, but --recursive works..weird
22:33  guampa: and just place echo $a $b
22:33  guampa: Al_nz1: but this is getting a little #bash ish i think
22:33  Nibble: Debugging is twice as hard as actually writing the code, therefore, by definition you are not smart enough to debug code that you have written as clever as you can.
22:33  nightwalk: Of course, in defense of the bargain basement cruft, apple's extremely expensive devices fair no better when 802.1x is in play. That's just a case of a software stack being in dire need of being replaced with a better *nix, though ;)
22:33  JonMarkGo: GreenJim: How would I exclude a specific sub-directory?
22:34  Al_nz1: guampa can you see why its cutting off those digits?
22:35  pingfloyd: nightwalk: not all bargains are bad and not all expensive stuff is good.  People just need to do their homework
22:35  nightwalk: gordboy: and ~80% of the time, you'd be right. Most people *are* stupid/incompetent ;)
22:35  pingfloyd: there's plenty of overpriced garbage
22:35  Al_nz1: guampa you mean like http://pastie.org/1336539
22:35  Al_nz1: guampa woops - where do I put input file?
22:36  nightwalk: pingfloyd: well, in my case 'people' == 'clients' most of the time. They buy what they want even if I warn them ahead of time it's utter garbage. Then they expect me to make it work :/
22:36  pingfloyd: nightwalk: do you get paid by the hour?
22:36  GreenJim: JonMarkGo: -r and --recursive is the same option.  to exclude files, use --exclude=MOTIF
22:36  nightwalk: That might be fine...*if* I were McGuiver
22:37  nightwalk: pingfloyd: no. contract-based, mostly.
22:37  pingfloyd: client incompetence should be lining your pockets
22:37  nightwalk: pingfloyd: if I were dishonest, it might be

22:38  nightwalk: Just look what dishonesty did for gates and jobs
22:38  pingfloyd: it has to do with you getting paid for you time
22:38  pingfloyd: whether client listens or disregards advice, that is on them
22:39  tydeas: the disk is an ntfs
22:39  pingfloyd: just don't work for salary, so you don't get screwed out of the deal
22:39  nightwalk: pingfloyd: it's complicated. Just suffice it to say its in my best interests not to piss off my client base.
22:40  tydeas: what umask to use in fstab to get the partition be rwx from a certain or all users?
22:40  pingfloyd: piss them off how?  You give them your opinion.  They listen or don't.  You get paid by the hour either way.
22:40  pingfloyd: they take the bad approach, it means more job security for you
22:41  Al_nz1: with sed and pattern matching \(..*\) to me looks for .. anything?
22:41  nightwalk: Al_nz1: correct. as long as it's unanchored, anyway

22:42  nightwalk: pingfloyd: that might work...if I were paid hourly :/

22:42  Yanch0: hi. i am connecting a usb disk (from a freeview box) via usb - [165628.424174] usb 1-1.1.4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 8 -- but /dev/sda is not finding anything. trying fdisk -l and also df -h no luck .. anything else to see as what it is trying to be found pelase?
22:43  compgenius999: ugh, anyone know why my emesene won't log me in? it just sits there saying connecting, i've made sure there's no other emesene running, and i can log in fine from other clients
22:43  Al_nz1: nightwalk hmmm
22:44  nightwalk: Al_nz1: also note that the \(\) captures that 'anything', so you can reference it later via \1, \2,...\n
22:44  Al_nz1: nightwalk I cant see what it would match in "S 36 43.165,E174 36.992" ?
22:44  gordboy: Yanch0: blkid, as root, might help
22:45  gordboy: Yanch0: also dmesg or /var/log/messages
22:45  Yanch0: let me try gordboy
22:45  nightwalk: Al_nz1: depends what characters come before and after it. I don't know either without any context
22:45  Yanch0: gordboy, Bus 001 Device 008: ID 02ad:138c HUMAX Co., Ltd. PVR Mass Storage tthats lusb
22:45  Al_nz1: nightwalk the whole sed line is sed 's/^S.*\(\..*\),.*$/\1*60/' | bc
22:46  Yanch0: gordboy, but blkid shown nothing
22:46  pingfloyd: nightwalk: then you screwed yourself from the get go
22:46  Al_nz1: i can see \1*60 which makes sense. it should be grabbing .165*60 in my quote above
22:46  pingfloyd: that created a situation where it is a win win for the client no matter what they do
22:46  nightwalk: Al_nz1: It matches everything between the first . ('\.') and the next comma
22:47  Al_nz1: nightwalk I thought it was looking for .. anything tho?
22:47  pingfloyd: working salary on a contract is always a losing proposition
22:48  the_file: hi
22:48  the_file: does the linux kernel from kernel.org come with gnu utilities?.
22:48  nightwalk: pingfloyd: again, it's complicated. Being as it's contract work, the requirements are set down right at the beginning. Though as I said, with this client base I have to be careful, which usually means caving to relatively minor demands.
22:48  the_file: and are there flags to compile it for amd processors?.
22:49  nightwalk: Al_nz: .* by itself matches anything. .* between two anchor characters matches anything between those anchor characters
22:49  compgenius999: the_archit3ct, no it doesn't come with gnu utils, and also, you can choose what CPU to compile it for in make config or make menuconfig
22:49  pingfloyd: nightwalk: because it's salary, their bad decisions cost you instead of them
22:49  compgenius999: the_file*
22:50  the_file: compgenius999: were do I get gnu utils?.
22:50  Al_nz1: nightwalk: so * on its on is not a wild card? its only a wild card when preceeded by as per .* ?
22:51  nightwalk: Al_nz1: '.' means 'any character'. * means 'match as many characters as possible'. So, .* means 'match any character as many times as possible'
22:52  the_file: yes '.' mean any char one time
22:52  guampa: Al_nz1: back
22:53  nightwalk: Al_nz1: however, when you do something like 1.*2, that part of the expression only *starts* firing after it encounters a 1, and it continues only until it encounters a 2
22:53  Al_nz1: nightwalk: so \.  means just ., and then .* means any character as many times as possible?
22:54  Al_nz1: guampa: hey - just working through your code - getting my head around it
22:54  pingfloyd: Al_nz1: wildcards are different than regex
22:54  nightwalk: Al_nz1: I would strongly urge you to borrow a finite state automata or state machine book from the library, btw. It'll definitely help :)
22:54  guampa: Al_nz1: i see the only thing that doesn't seem to work is the last number right?
22:54  Al_nz1: guampa yea
22:54  pingfloyd: Al_nz1: * is a wildcard to the shell aka glob, but .* is a regular expression
22:54  guampa: thats $b
22:55  Al_nz1: guampa: I tried to demolish your code @ http://pastie.org/1336599
22:55  Al_nz1: but forgot input file
22:55  jelly-home: Al_nz1: * means "match 0 or more instances of whatever is immediately left of *"
22:55  guampa: don't demolish please :(
22:55  nightwalk: Al_nz1: yes. It's common for characters which otherwise have special meanings in the language to be 'escaped' via \ to represent the literal character
22:55  Al_nz1: guampa: I need to run but will leave logged in if you find the solution could you please pm it to me? :-)
22:55  jelly-home: Al_nz1: . means "any single character", similar to ? in a file glob (shell expansion)
22:55  Al_nz1: nightwalk: thanks - I understand it now
22:56  Al_nz1: jelly-home: ta got it now
22:56  Al_nz1: by guys
22:56  guampa: Al_nz1: no problem, btw your mod is ok, just have to add an "; done " at the end
22:56 * nightwalk wishes shells had used regex syntax for globbing :/
22:57  H3r0: can someone help me?I want to program in asm in linux how do I need to do this
22:57  H3r0: ?
22:57 * guampa agrees
22:57  nightwalk: H3r0: nasm
22:57  shades: I have two machines. One of these machines has an external address. Both machines have an internal address. I can reach the machine with the external address at http://x.x.x.x. The internal machine is also running something on httpd but since it doesn't have an outside facing address I need to do some portfoward business...
22:57  H3r0: nightwalk - and linker?
22:58  guampa: nightwalk: anyway bash has sorta regex in one of the parameter substitution expressions
22:58  guampa: but it's not the same
22:58  pingfloyd: doesn't really matter with the shell since you can pipe output
22:58  shades: so I should be able to ssh to the external address ssh root@internaladdress -L 6000:localhost:83 -L 6001:localhost:443 and then I should be able to reach that internal box with localhost:6000 ??
22:58  shades: I'm so close to figuring this out
22:58  shades: 8 /
22:58  nightwalk: H3r0: ld, i'd imagine
22:59  jelly-home: shades: what's on 83 on the remote machine? :-)
22:59  guampa: pingfloyd: imo there should be a straightforward way to use posix regex directly instead of the normal globbing syntax
22:59  H3r0: ok 10x
22:59  H3r0: CYa
22:59  shades: jelly-home: httpd, /i think/
22:59  jelly-home: shades: default's :80
22:59  shades: I know
22:59  shades: stuffs set up weird here
22:59  nightwalk: shades: you could also use '-D <port>' instead to create a SOCKS5 proxy
23:00  shades: I mean, I can ssh to the external box, and then ssh to the internal box from the external box with out a problem, the problem lies I need to fire up some sort of GUI thing in internet exploder to populate some information into there
23:00  shades: and I can't do this w/o all this nasty port forwarding business
23:01  acidchild: hello, does anyone know a console based SIP VoIP client? maybe something that is ncurses based? Thanks.
23:01  guampa: shades: i've had problems forwarding https
23:01  shades: I kind of get the concept but I'm not sure why it isn't working
23:02  nightwalk: shades: create an ssh connection using -D, then point your browser to '127.0.0.1:<port_you_chose>' as the SOCKS proxy, and you're effectively using the browser from the machine that has the external interface. That means you can access anything that system can.
23:02  shades: nightwalk: would you please be able to walk me through the exact syntax for that?
23:03  puff: What do people like for converting audio CDs to mp3s?
23:03  nightwalk: guampa: https *can't* be forwarded without causing the browser to complain about the certs
23:03  shades: from the external box: ssh root@internalip -D ?? 127.0.0.1:83/443/?
23:03  guampa: nightwalk: not to mention the web apps breaking all over
23:03  puff: Ideally I'd like something as automated as possible, so I can just stick a CD in my drive and ignore it, ahve the files all saved to my music directory, then come back and eject the CD, put in the next one, etc.
23:04  nightwalk: shades: 'ssh -D 8080 user@host', then set the SOCKS proxy in your browser to '127.0.0.1:8080'. That's it.
23:04  Yanch0: any idea about how to fix this error please? http://pastebin.com/VZ75aAdQ i tried to do apt-get libqt4-dev .. is it a broken package?
23:05  shades: lets see if this works
23:06  pingfloyd: Yanch0: what distro??
23:06  shades: nightwalk: and then I should just be able to hit http://localhost which is going to be the internal machine?
23:06  Yanch0: pingfloyd,  ubuntu 10.10
23:06  shades: or do I type in http://localhost:8080 ?
23:07  pingfloyd: Yanch0: what command did you type?
23:07  Yanch0: pingfloyd,  sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
23:07  shades: erg 8 / this is still not working
23:08  [CRT]: Yanch0: check out the 2'nd post: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/apt-get-dpkg-error-files-list-file-missing-final-newline-271118/
23:08  [CRT]: different package, but same concept
23:09  pingfloyd: can you pastebin the entire output?
23:10  nightwalk: shades: no. if you use -D, and set your browser to use 127.0.0.1:8080 as a proxy, *all* requests are as if they were coming from the remote server. So, for example, if you browser to http://whatismyipaddress.com/ it'll show you the external IP of the remote system

23:20  nightwalk: Dunno if there's a similar add-on for IE or not, but 'autssh/ssh -D'+Firefox's FoxyProxy makes for a nice ad-hoc set-and-forget browser proxying solution ;)
23:21 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 140 seconds
23:23  nightwalk: shades: Also, I guess I should explain a bit better. The -D switch tells the remote openssh server to also be SOCKS server. So, you should probably view 'ssh -D' as an SSLized SOCKS proxy connection rather than a 'tunnel'
23:23  TheSarge: I am trying to extract the contents of a DVD iso onto a thumbdrive to make a bootable drive, but when I try to extract the contents of the ISO I just get a readme talking about UDF?
23:23  shades: I need to read a detailed manual
23:23  shades: on this
23:23  shades: I finally 'figured it out' but I'm not exactly sure how it's working
23:24  shades: but I can verify that it /is/ working
23:24  shades: which is a start
23:24  TheSarge: Does anyone know what I need to do to extract the content of the DVD?
23:24  TheSarge: The DVD ISO worls fine.
23:24  TheSarge: works*
23:24  nightwalk: shades: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS
23:25  nightwalk: TheSarge: mount -o loop /path/to/your/image.iso /mnt/whatever && cp /mnt/whatever/* /destination/
23:26  TheSarge: nightwalk: When mounted it only shows the readme? But it is 3.0GB and I have used it to install a vm, so I know it works
23:26  nightwalk: Oops...*should* be 'cp -aR' rather than plain 'cp'...
23:27  nightwalk: TheSarge: Probably has a couple different types of volumes in it. Is it a Mac disc or something?
23:27  shades: nightwalk: thanks
23:27  TheSarge: nightwalk: Winblows
23:27  gravestone: Hello. Is there a way to remove the mail and bluetooth icons from the indicator applet in gnome-panel ?
23:28  nightwalk: gravestone: right-click+'remove from panel', maybe?
23:29  gravestone: nightwalk: Well no, the indicator contains the volume + battery level which I want to keep.
23:30  nightwalk: TheSarge: maybe try '-t iso9660' on the mount command and see if that does anything differently. Iirc, you can use dvdrecord/cdrecord to view the disc info, but the syntax escapes me atm
23:31  nightwalk: gravestone: dunno then. I wondered that myself, but it doesn't bother me enough to motivate me to look into it. I imagine if there's a way, you probably have to use the gconf editor or similar
23:31  Rabbitbunny: I think I'm using nice wrong.  'nice -n 19 randombin' will make that bin the last thing to get proc time, right?
23:31  nightwalk: rabbitbunny: -n 20
23:32  Rabbitbunny: nightwalk: hmm. than I'm doing something else wrong. Thanks
23:32  mutante: i see how people talked about adding "Load from db" and "Save to db" features to gnumeric back in 2003: http://osdir.com/ml/gnome.apps.gnumeric/2003-02/msg00020.html  but my current Debian squeeze version still does not have features like that. is there a way to hook it up to a MySQL backend? and if not, of all the output formats it offers (.gnumeric XML, CSV, .dif, XHTML,bla bla) what would you pick for MySQL import with the least parsing
23:34  gravestone: ok, thanks nightwalk.
23:38  sako: hey guys, what are the options for copying a file to another server in a shell script
23:38  guampa: netcat
23:40  sako: hmmm
23:41  sako: i was trying to use scp however, you can't pass the user/password in one command :/
23:41  mutante: sako: like:  scp -B -i <key> <file> <user>@<host>:/path/
23:42  mutante: -i to use keyfile instead of password and -B is batch mode
23:42  guampa: sako: use public key auth
23:43  guampa: you have -o ControlPath
23:45  guampa: sako, you can first make a ssh connection with -o ControlPath pathtosocket -o ControlMaster yes
23:45  sako: id have to get on the toehr server though right?
23:45  sako: and put in the key in authorized_keys
23:46  mutante: thats correct, you need to put the *public* key into authorized_keys on the remote side and use the *private* key with the -i option on your side
23:46  guampa: sako: yes, but using control sockets you don't need it. but it's better if you can use keys
23:56  lautriv: guampa, will you use this ssh connection often ?
23:57  guampa: lautriv: i was answering sako's question
23:57  lautriv: guampa, fauk in scroll :-)
23:57  guampa: lol
23:58  lautriv: guampa, but then, why not just creating a key for a certain user/machine and run this script with that user ?
23:59  guampa: lautriv: that's a correct approach too and i have used it, but it depends as you say on how often you'll run the script
23:59  guampa: for a cron'ed one, definitely
