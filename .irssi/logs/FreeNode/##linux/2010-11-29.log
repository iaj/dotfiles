08:25  squid0: but a live cd will not mount a partition as /
08:26  squid0: its own / sits in ram/on the cd
08:26  mAniAk-_-: so?
08:26  lautriv_: mount it /somewhere
08:26  dextro_: i dont know a whole lot about computers so could someone explain why i slowly lose ram? i have a (java) game server running and it uses a lot of ram every time i reboot it it seems `top` reports less and less free ram
08:26  squid0: oh ok, I understand
08:26  lautriv_: on the other hand, if fdisk -l is blank, you haven't loaded the neccessary drivers to do so.
08:26 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 128 seconds
08:26  dextro_: gets to the point where i have to reboot the machine because i dont have enough free ram to even boot it
08:27  dextro_: machine has 4gb ram is a fresh install and has NOTHING else on it
08:27  lautriv_: dextro_, if you use the most bloated and ugliest language, no wonder at all. java is greedy.
08:27  dextro_: but should ending the process not free the ram?
08:27  dextro_: even for gay java
08:28  lautriv_: dextro_, you'rs would be the first occurence.
08:28  dextro_: ?
08:29  squid0: why would I need to load drivers to mount these partitions?? they're already mounted and I'm reading them fine, but fdisk -l still reads blank
08:29  lautriv_: squid0, fdisk -l lists partitions, what will you mount if there are none ?
08:30  mAniAk-_-: squid0: sudo/root fdisk?
08:31  lautriv_: dextro_, resources are freed on demand but java is for lazy coders, they are not supposed to care that much.
08:34  squid0: I really don't know
08:34  dextro_: i just really wish i didnt have to reboot the MACHINE every couple days
08:34  dextro_: to free enough ram to boot the gameserver
08:34  lautriv_: squid0, type id and tell us the result
08:34  squid0: fdisk -l /dev/sdb3 says Cannot open /dev/sdb3
08:35  lautriv_: squid0, sdb3 is already partition of sdb
08:35  mAniAk-_-: squid0: are you root? or are you using sudo?
08:36  lautriv_: dextro_, you may activate an oom-killer or use cron to manually get rid of the bloat.
08:36  squid0: I'll try root
08:36  dwhite: dextro_, you may have a buggy version of java. have you considered upgrading to a newer version?
08:37  dwhite: dextro_, also, #java may have some suggestions.
08:38  lautriv_: squid0, changing system resources needs always privileges.
08:38  squid0: http://pastebin.com/5tavThxB
08:39  Psi-Jack: dextro_: For starters, what JDK are we talking, and what kind of specs on the system you're running it on?
08:39  squid0: oh, it also says Partition table entries are not in disk order
08:40  lautriv_: squid0, who on earth decided to partition this way ?
08:40  squid0: me
08:40  squid0: long story
08:41  squid0: but it's been booting just fine until last night when I installed the latest linux mint onto the 36G partition
08:41  lautriv_: squid0, make a backup and try again, you can't start on a extended partition.
08:41  Psi-Jack: Speaking of partitioning and long stories. Here's a good one: http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Certified-DBA.aspx
08:42  squid0: oh, of course the most worrying thing is it seems that the partitions are intact from before. they were not formatted, and linux mint was not installed on any of them
08:43  squid0: the installer never made any complaints; in fact it took some time to "copy files". but on boot, I did see an error message at the terminal that said that the disk found no package files
08:44  lautriv_: Psi-Jack, nice link
08:44  squid0: that is, the dvd disk
08:44  Psi-Jack: heh yeah.
08:45  Psi-Jack: How NOT to be a stupid fool. ;)
08:45  mrcarrot: the previous version of linux mint is also having problem with hd. a fully working and checked hd is appearing like it would work (hd led shining) and the system hangs...
08:45  dextro_: lautriv_ a oom-killer?
08:45  dextro_: dwhite i just installed jre from archlinux's pacman a couple weeks ago can't be _that_ old
08:46  mrcarrot: for me it looks like ubuntu and ubuntu based distros are just becoming more buggy for each release
08:46  dextro_: Psi-Jack, jre, xeon quad 2.8, 4gb ram
08:46  Psi-Jack: dextro_: Real informative. jre of WHAT version, what JVM?
08:46  dextro_: lol sorry
08:47  lautriv_: dextro_, there is a function called so it kills apps that tend to fulfill too much resources but usually on bad functionality.
08:47  dextro_: [mc@anubis server5]$ java -version
08:47  dextro_: java version "1.6.0_22"
08:47  dextro_: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04)
08:47  dextro_: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode)
08:47  Psi-Jack: Okay, so Sun Java.
08:47  squid0: lautriv_: so if I try again, and install the new linux mint to one of the (ext3) partitions, and tell the installer to install grub to a non-extended partition, that should work, right?
08:47  bocaneri: Nets went POOF!
08:48  squid0: where should I choose to install grub to (in the installer)?
08:48  Psi-Jack: dextro_: Well, the problem with that system is the 4 GB. Running Java anything needs RAM like no tomorrow.
08:48  dextro_: yeah system only uses about 500mb before i boot up the java gameserver
08:49  Psi-Jack: dextro_: But, there's also command-line options for the jvm to limit max mem
08:49  dextro_: -Xms
08:49  dextro_: i have been using them
08:49  dextro_: problem is each time it shuts down there is less ram avil
08:49  Psi-Jack: dextro_: What's your -Xms set to?
08:49  lautriv_: squid0, for a multiboot, use a small partition for /boot only, around 100M, then swap, then your first / after that maxe extended partitions. this way you get sdX1-3 and 5-rest.
08:49  dextro_: for no aparent reason
08:49  Psi-Jack: dextro_: And -Xmx?
08:49  lautriv_: s/maxe/make
08:49  dextro_: min ram is 1024 max is 2500
08:50  Psi-Jack: dextro_: This system have ECC memory?
08:50  dextro_: uh no idea
08:50  Psi-Jack: Is it server grade equipment?
08:50  dextro_: doubt it
08:50  dextro_: only $100 a month
08:50  Psi-Jack: You don't know?
08:51  Psi-Jack: I see.. So you're paying for a server you know nothing about, eh?
08:51  dextro_: i said i suck with computers in my first comment!
08:51  lautriv_: Psi-Jack, Xeon i'd guess it'S ecc
08:51  Psi-Jack: That doesn't improve things at all. ;)
08:51  Psi-Jack: lautriv_: Likely, but can't be sure. $100/mo is good enough for low-class server hardware.
08:52  Psi-Jack: dextro_: Distro?
08:53  dextro_: archlinux
08:53  Psi-Jack: For a server? Are you stupid?
08:53  dextro_: yes :D
08:53  Psi-Jack: Ugh.
08:53  Psi-Jack: I'm going to simply say this then.
08:53  [R]: lol
08:53 * dextro_ tenses up
08:53  Psi-Jack: Call your hosting provider, tell them the story, and tell them you suspect memory leaking issues possibly due to failing hardware.
08:54  squid0: thanks, lautriv_ and mAniAk-_-
08:55  dextro_: ok will do be back in a bit thanks a million for all the help so far :)
08:57  lautriv_: is rsync tuneable to multi-port ?
09:00  [R]: lautriv_: meaning?
09:00  lautriv_: [R], looks like my ISP sucks at winsize so i'll try to opens-up some bundles.
09:01  [R]: lautriv_: wtf?
09:01  lautriv_: [R], kinda bonding but not with lines but ports.
09:01  bocaneri: There's a command, I don't remember what it is, something like "inet list addr" to get the local IP...?
09:02  [R]: lautriv_: english... do you speak it
09:02  bocaneri: [R], lautriv's Englisch ist VIEL besser als mein Deutsch. Uff da!
09:02  [R]: bocaneri: ifconfig
09:03  SpiceMan: bocaneri: ip addr
09:03  lautriv_: bocaneri, addr list
09:03  Diverdude: Does anybody know if this guy: http://www.cetoncorp.com/products.php May be used in a linux machine somehow?
09:03  [R]: this is so unfair
09:03  [R]: people claim unbinding nouveau works for them
09:03  [R]: why doesn't it work for me :(
09:03  bocaneri: ifconfig ain't it...
09:03  bocaneri: addr ain't it...
09:03  [R]: Diverdude: i've heard there is drivers coming for it... but you can't watch anything not copy-freely
09:04  bocaneri: .... and ip addr spews tons of crap.
09:04 --- centosian_ is now known as centosian
09:04  John_Morgan: what should I do if kernel have no *snd-hda-intel* with a hd audio card?
09:04  [R]: Diverdude: i.e. if you dont already get it on QAM or over firewire... you're not gonna get it with that
09:04  Diverdude: [R], im not really sure what you mean? Get what over QAM or firewire?
09:05  [R]: Diverdude: the channels
09:05  Diverdude: [R], aha...now i get channels via DVB-C
09:05  [R]: thats a card for the US
09:05 * [R] shakes his head
09:06  mrcarrot: John_Morgan: two options: 1. compile a new kernel. 2. change distro
09:06  MTecknology: I feel like Firefox 4.0 is trying to become Google Chrome......
09:06  MTecknology: I don't like it one bit
09:06  Diverdude: [R], what?
09:07  [R]: Diverdude: it helps if you actaully READ
09:08  Diverdude: [R], sorry.... i didnt want to offend you
09:08  [R]: your inability to read isn't going to offend me
09:08 * bocaneri googles around and runs into tons of ADVERTISEMENTS... welcome to the future, folks, where googling that used to take seconds will now be a prime time TV viewing experience...
09:09  Diverdude: [R], im a bit new to this whole thing, so please be a bit patient
09:09  [R]: Diverdude: you're not gonna get very far if you can't even read
09:10  MTecknology: bocaneri: I'm getting to the point of looking for a new search engine - I love everything else they offer but as far as a search engine- they're becoming bing....
09:10  MTecknology: Bingle
09:12  bocaneri: It's not google doing it - it's the sites I'm visiting.
09:12  Diverdude: [R], im not really sure what i misread. You said "if you dont already get it on QAM or over firewire... you're not gonna get it with that", with "that" being channels...so i say i get my channels over the cable...where else should i get it from? Maybe im just beeing ignorant and stupid, but hey as i said i am a bit new to this.
09:12  [R]: Diverdude: you dont live in the US... the website CLEARLY says the card is for the US
09:13 * Lady_Aleena sets out cookies on the table for everyone.
09:13  stinky: bocaneri: welcome to adblock plus
09:13  stinky: now, what is your problem?
09:15  bocaneri: The fact that I didn't realise all that crap was there because this is a new install and I don't have all my accumulated crap on it yet.
09:15  lautriv_: Diverdude just punch a hauppauge in your machine and install mythtv.
09:21  zW: Hi fellow linux users.
09:21  Psi-Jack: Diverdude: [R] does have a point. The card is very specific that it only specifies US Digital Cable.
09:21  Psi-Jack: Hello, ungabunga.
09:22  zW: Does someone know what currently a good linux based scalable anti-spam solution is ?
09:22  [R]: spamassasin
09:22  Psi-Jack: zW: Like, spamassassin, rbl, and clamav?
09:22  zW: spamass is ok
09:22  zW: but not for 500.000 mailboxes :-)
09:22  Psi-Jack: Yes it is.
09:22  zW: clamd is scalable
09:22  zW: that is ok
09:22  zW: But spamass is to much recourses
09:23  zW: I was thinking about britemail
09:23  Psi-Jack: zW: And what do you think britemail uses?
09:23  zW: spamass ?
09:24  zW: Isn't there a less resource using system then spamass on the market somewhere ?
09:24  Psi-Jack: Oh, wait, Symantec, EWWWWWW! Get off my planet Symantec!
09:24  zW: No
09:24  zW: Symantec sucks
09:24  zW: I need better :)
09:24  Psi-Jack: zW: Do you want, works, or do you want fast?
09:24  Psi-Jack: Britemail == Symantec.
09:25  zW: brr
09:25  zW: no britemail then
09:25  zW: :)
09:25  zW: Any other suggestions
09:25  zW: What does barracuda use ?
09:25  Psi-Jack: What part of spamassassin don't you understand?
09:25  lautriv_: zW, i'm courious, wanna handle 500k mails and not give resources for it ?
09:26  Psi-Jack: That's 500k mailboxes. Wether in use or not.
09:30  zW: The thing is
09:30  zW: I wanne make recourses for it
09:30  zW: The question is
09:31  zW: Can spamassassin handle it ?
09:31  Psi-Jack: "make recourses"?
09:31  zW: I mean, I can't setup 100 spamass servers :)
09:32  ApplePieFromScra: over 9000!
09:33  lxsameer: hi does any one know a tool replacing OS X bless in linux ?
09:33  [R]: lxsameer: what is it?
09:34  Psi-Jack: lxsameer: Umm, to make a partition bootable?
09:34  lxsameer: [R]: http://www.unix.com/man-page/All/8/bless/
09:34  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: yeah
09:34  Psi-Jack: fdisk
09:34  [R]: lol
09:34  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: no bless do more that that
09:34  ApplePieFromScra: how much mail do you have that you would need 100 spam assassin servers?
09:34  Psi-Jack: lxsameer: So what? OS X is crazy too.
09:35  Psi-Jack: ApplePieFromScra: Give it up now while you still have hair.
09:35  Psi-Jack: Or, crust in your case.
09:35  ApplePieFromScra: lol, i shave my head
09:36  ApplePieFromScra: i was just going to say i bet 5-7 ecelerity servers could do as much mail processing as 100 spam assasin servers
09:36  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: with bless you can specify a boot directory
09:36  Psi-Jack: Uh huh. So what?
09:36  Psi-Jack: OS X also uses EFI and GPT.
09:37  Psi-Jack: Is there a complete replacement for bless in linux? No.
09:37  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: i see , i want to install refit in a hfs+ parition for booting linux
09:37  Psi-Jack: HFS+ is a filesystem format, not partition.
09:38  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: my bad
09:39  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: hmmmmmmmmmmm , ah my god, i hate my self, where was my brain when i bought mackbookpro
09:40  Psi-Jack: I'd buy a Mac myself.
09:40  Psi-Jack: But, it wouldn't be to put Linux on it.
09:41  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: can i bless refit from OSX installation disc?
09:41  Psi-Jack: lxsameer: #macosx
09:42  lxsameer: Psi-Jack: hmmmmmmmmmmmmm thanks any way
09:44  ApplePieFromScra: man, when are these hippies going to stop
09:44  ApplePieFromScra: wifi is killing trees now, apparently
09:46  lautriv_: ApplePieFromScra, not unlikely
09:49  yagoo: lxsameer, best to ask #refit if there's that channel.. there's a refit boot cd actually
09:49  lxsameer: yagoo: thanks
09:58  crocket: I obtained a DDR3 SO-DIMM RAM, today.
09:58  crocket: It doesn't fit in the socket perfectly such that it gets pulled when I pull it lightly.
09:58  crocket: It can't be pulled if it fits.
09:59  crocket: Does anybody know how to make it fit into the mainboard socket?
09:59  reisio: crocket: I only speak English
09:59  crocket: reisio : what the hell do you mean?
10:00  reisio: my sentiments exactly
10:00  crocket: reisio : I don't know what you refer to.
10:00  reisio: crocket: I don't know what _you_ refer to
10:00  reisio: can you rephrase?
10:00  crocket: reisio : I don't know if you are mocking me.
10:01  reisio: does it matter?
10:01  crocket: yes
10:01  crocket: reisio : You should tell me what you mean by "I only speak English".
10:02  crocket: Or it's just a meaningless sentence passing by.
10:02  reisio: we're past that
10:02  reisio: can you rephrase your problem?
10:03  crocket: reisio : My DDR3 SO-DIMM RAM doesn't fit in the RAM socket well.
10:03  crocket: It gets pulled very easily.
10:03  reisio: well?
10:03  reisio: does it fall out on its own?
10:03  crocket: reisio : No by gravitation, but a light pull would do.
10:04  reisio: so what's the problem?
10:04  manixor: How can I open the UI add new user, from console?
10:04  reisio: manixor: what distro?
10:04  mrcarrot: manixor: adduser :)
10:04  crocket: reisio : It can't be pulled easily when it's in the socket.
10:04  mrcarrot: manixor: as root, of course... or then sudo adduser
10:05  meznak: crocket: it's one of three things: you have the wrong ram, you installed it incorrectly, or your motherboard sucks (ram should lock in place)
10:05  reisio: crocket: you just said it's pulled too easy
10:05  reisio: or the stick was mishandled and now it doesn't fit as well
10:05  crocket: reisio : I'm saying what should be.
10:05  reisio: either way, unless it's falling out on its own, I don't see a problem
10:05  reisio: crocket: I should be rich and covered in women made out of blue nehi
10:05  reisio: but I'm not
10:05  crocket: reisio : There will be a problem later.
10:05  reisio: crocket: yes, there will be
10:05  reisio: there always is
10:06 * meznak golfclaps
10:06  reisio: but I doubt what you've described makes it any more likely
10:06  crocket: reisio : What if BIOS doesn't recognize the RAM this way?
10:06 * reisio kidnaps pizza delivery guy
10:06  reisio: crocket: that would be a problem
10:06  reisio: confucius say: there is no problem until there is
10:06  crocket: confucius is a dead guy
10:06  reisio: why don't you _find out_ if the computer recognizes it before you worry about it not being recognized
10:06  reisio: crocket: _is_ he? :p
10:07  crocket: reisio : He died thousands of years ago
10:07  reisio: crocket: prove it
10:07  crocket: reisio : read wikipedia article
10:08  reisio: good for you
10:08  crocket: reisio : He was born about the same time jesus christ was born.
10:09  crocket: He needs to rephrase his own terms
10:10  Rabenklaue: hi, I've just updated to 2.6.37-rc3 and got problems with my thermal info indicators - looks like there have been some changes in kernel taken place.
10:10 * mrcarrot makes a dd/gzip image of a 320Gb hd... boooring
10:10  Rabenklaue: What do I need to activate in order to get e.g. acpitool to show the temperature of my cpu again?
10:11  reisio: crocket: give or take 500 years? :p
10:11  reisio: mrcarrot: sofa king boring
10:11  manixor: reisio: mrcarrot I'm using: Scientific Linux -- Linux version 2.6.18-128.1.1.el5 (gcc version 4.1.2 20071124 (Red Hat 4.1.2-42)), and adduser not working
10:12  reisio: Rabenklaue: ...did your config change?
10:12  reisio: it shouldn't have, not markedly
10:12  reisio: manixor: the proper command is useradd
10:12  reisio: manixor: but did you say you wanted to use a GUI?
10:12  loomsen: manixor: you're pretty outdated
10:13  reisio: well, scientific linux has a specific purpose
10:13  reisio: not that it isn't unfortunate they chose Red Hat as a base, but still
10:13  manixor: reisio: loomsen This is what I need to use. Not working useradd to. I think I need to use system-config-user
10:13  manixor: But I don't have -X
10:13  reisio: manixor: are you root?
10:13  Rabenklaue: reisio: I only did make menuconfig and updated some parts in the driver section and not touched the acpi related sections.
10:13  manixor: reisio: Yes, I'm root
10:14  loomsen: manixor: read the manpage, useradd is the proper command
10:14  reisio: Rabenklaue: do you have a copy of your old config?
10:14  reisio: there may be a GUI, depending on what DE you're using, but you should be able to use useradd regardless
10:14  reisio: and may as well, it'll be faster and more versatile
10:15  Rabenklaue: From 2.6.36, yes I have and tried to compile it with this config, but did not change anything for me
10:15  reisio: Rabenklaue: okay how about this: why are you updating to .37 at all?
10:16 * bocaneri is still using .26 on his debian stable
10:16  reisio: yeah, I'm using .26 on your debian stable as well
10:17  loomsen: heh
10:18  Rabenklaue: reisio: For testing reasons - as there have been some major changes regarding the remove process of BKL I wanted to check whether there are some performance improvements.
10:18 * bocaneri succeeds  in writing a script that mounts each machine's home directory for $user on the local machines ~/net/user for *every* machine on the net
10:18  Vutral: i got a raid1 linux software raid and it is not going to boot
10:19  crocket: It's time to boot up the server computer
10:19  Vutral: i need assistance in fixing grub
10:19  bocaneri: Vutral, which grub, and what's the problem?
10:19  Vutral: 0.92
10:19  Vutral: i guess
10:20  spektom: Hi
10:20  Vutral: grub (GNU GRUB 0.97)
10:20  spektom: is there a way to specify alias containing dots in /etc/aliases ?
10:20  bocaneri: Vutral, OK, what's the problem?
10:20  Rabenklaue: from my config: CONFIG_ACPI_THERMAL=y and CONFIG_THERMAL=y
10:20  Vutral: i installed it
10:20  Vutral: manually
10:20  spektom: postfix says "unknown mail transport error" when sending to such an alias
10:20  reisio: Rabenklaue: well no offense, but maybe you should master kernel management and personal system hardware requirement debugging before you work on that other stuff
10:20  Vutral: and my the config file i found but which oviously was from (2006)
10:20  bocaneri: I'm not going to help anybody who can't write more than two words on a line.
10:21  reisio: Rabenklaue: AKA: use the stable kernel
10:21  Vutral: but it still not going to boot
10:21  Vutral: grub.conf was empty when i found the system not booten
10:21  Vutral: and aswell menu.lst
10:21  Vutral: i now fixed the menu.lst
10:21  Vutral: didnt boot
10:22  Vutral: stage1 isnt booting even i think ^^
10:22  scp1: reisio, http://www.linux.fm/ # for you babe
10:22  Vutral: i need a procedure to fix the grub installation without knowing how it was installed before
10:23  reisio: thanks hun
10:23  bocaneri: There isn't one because you have to tailor the menu.lst to your present layout.
10:23  reisio: ooh, crypto/zlib.c is my favorite track
10:23  Vutral: if the kernel would support kexec i did boot with it :D
10:23  Vutral: and fix it then
10:23  scp1: reisio, mine as well!
10:24  reisio: I might like the dubstep remix better, though
10:24  reisio: wow, I didn't realize espeak had such an antiquated voice :p
10:25  Vutral: reisio, festival rules
10:25  Vutral: you need mbrola
10:25  Vutral: only the standard voices are bad
10:25  Vutral: :D
10:26  reisio: shouldn't the standard ones be... good?
10:26  Vutral: they arent
10:26  Vutral: check mbrola
10:26  crocket: I can't boot my server.
10:26  crocket: Maybe it's the wrong ram.
10:27  reisio: heh http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKfrBV4WH8w
10:27  mrcarrot: crocket: i feel pity for you :(
10:28  crocket: mrcarrot, When somebody else put his RAM in my server, it booted fine.
10:28  crocket: Now with my RAM, it makes a farting sound and nothing.
10:34  Vutral: re
10:36  reisio: I don't know, this mbrola stuff doesn't sound very modern, either
10:36  Vutral: you need files
10:36  Vutral: for mbrola
10:36  Vutral: there was a artiicle in the linux magazine
10:36  Vutral: long time ago
10:36  Vutral: ^^
10:36  reisio: really, files?
10:36  reisio: I thought it would just appear
10:36  Vutral: yes files
10:36  Vutral: :D
10:37  Vutral: i really need to fix the booting problem
10:37  reisio: http://www2.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php checkout Audrey/UK
10:38  Vutral: maybe you should not focus on englisch voices
10:38  Vutral: ^^
10:38  Vutral: lol
10:38  Vutral: american
10:38  Vutral: ^^
10:38  Vutral: maybe
10:38  Vutral: you are strange btw
10:38  Vutral: you try to hear voices :P
10:38  Obvious: audrey sounds awful
10:38  Vutral: most people try to get rid of them
10:39  Vutral: lol
10:39  Obvious: awww hell, Charles/UK kicks ass
10:40  Obvious: he sounds like british colonial officer
10:40  bocaneri: Roit. That'll be quoit enoof o' that, then.
10:40  reisio: for some reason the UK voices are slightly better
10:41  reisio: Obvious: well compare them all
10:41  reisio: IMO Audrey sounds the best
10:41  Obvious: nope, even in the default text, f.e., she stresses "policIEs" and glugs on "below"
10:42  reisio: you're comparing it to a real person? :p
10:42  reisio: compare it to espeak :p
10:44  Obvious: why not festival?
10:46  Vutral: bla
10:46  Vutral: even with mbrola
10:46  Vutral: and the voicetools
10:46  Vutral: and festival
10:46  Vutral: you need to create the files yourself
10:46  Vutral: ^^
10:46  Vutral: you can model voices
10:46  reisio: that's what she said
10:46  Vutral: like you want
10:46  Vutral: its usually easier
10:47  Vutral: to write something which gives it a good sounding language
10:47  Vutral: wiriting policies als policees
10:47  Vutral: and so on
10:48  Vutral: festival only generates voice
10:48  Vutral: it cannot do natural language processing very well
10:48  Vutral: but as you see its easy for a human
10:48  Vutral: to set up the rules
10:48  Vutral: even thought we dont write down that rule set usually
10:48  reisio: as you can _see_
10:48  reisio: good one :p
10:48  Vutral: which is oviously a fault
10:49  Vutral: lol
10:49  Vutral: take more lsd ^^
10:49  Vutral: it makes you hear pictures and see sounds
10:49  Vutral: lol

11:06  __name__: hey
11:06  toader: hi, in the profile details of "top", what does it mean "cpu 99.9%ni"?
11:06  __name__: I have a Huawei E620 that works when using it after boot, but once I disconnect I have to reboot to reconnect.
11:06  __name__: Any suggestions?
11:08  reisio: __name__: luckily I have memorized what type of device every manufacturer/model number corresponds to
11:09  crocket: I fixed the problem
11:09  lautriv_: reisio,  :-)
11:09  crocket: I didn't put the RAM deep enough to lock it.
11:09  Psi-Jack: __name__: And what is this mysterious Huawei E620?
11:10  totesmuhgoats: reisio: what distro do you use btw?
11:10  __name__: mobile internet modem
11:10  SolomonKull: bleh, nmap is too slow
11:10  toader: Hi, could anybody help me dianoses if there is a CPU bound of running my program? thanks http://imagebin.ca/img/fTgbTg.png
11:10  reisio: totesmuhgoats: Dettu[Xx] of course! :p
11:10  reisio: totesmuhgoats: why do you ask?
11:11  totesmuhgoats: just curious cos i always see you in here
11:11  totesmuhgoats: never even heard of this distro before
11:11  reisio: totesmuhgoats: 'cause nobody uses it, not even me :p
11:11  reisio: toader: uhoh
11:11  reisio: python disco, very bad
11:12  toader: reisio: why very bad?
11:12  reisio: :p
11:12  SolomonKull: I wish I could commit myself to using a completly Libre system.
11:12  reisio: toader: it's actually a percentage, and why does it matter if it's high?
11:12  Psi-Jack: __name__: In looking at Huawei's site directly, I'm not seeing the E620, at all.
11:13 * lautriv_ renames crocket to mickey_mouse_job
11:13 * reisio is content using merely decoding and/or transcoding non-free to free
11:13  __name__: Psi-Jack: Maybe that's a european device?
11:13  toader: reisio: as it not very fast for my loading data
11:13  toader: reisio: i want to find the root reason
11:13  Psi-Jack: __name__: I did a specific model search for E620, no listings found.
11:13  reisio: toader: your python script?
11:13  reisio: toader: talk to #python
11:14  Psi-Jack: __name__: They do have an E 630, though,
11:14  reisio: e630, good blender, that
11:14  Termana: SolomonKull, why?
11:15  SolomonKull: Termana: Because.
11:15  lautriv_: Psi-Jack, i found lots of matches to E620 but it seems to be OEM for providers.
11:15  Termana: You wish you could commit yourself to a completely libre system so that programmers can starve?
11:15  bocaneri: When I was still working in an office, I was Windows-bound because the software required for that job was found on no other platform.
11:15  Termana: Just asking
11:16  Psi-Jack: lautriv_: Heh, well, that certainly doesn't do any good, then. Makes it even less likely to be well supported.
11:16 * crocket renames lautriv to handjob
11:16  crocket: ha
11:16  Psi-Jack: crocket: Behave.
11:16  crocket: sorry
11:16  Psi-Jack: This IS a family channel.
11:16  Termana: Psi-Jack, most of the time anyway
11:16  Psi-Jack: Termana: No. It is.
11:16  totesmuhgoats: reisio: oh i see, this is one of those distros that defeats the purpose of having a distro
11:16  SolomonKull: Termana: no, so that I can enjoy freedom.  If programmers cant make money coding, they should do something else.  Libre does not mean Free, either.  Learn the definition of these terms before you run your mouth at me.
11:17  reisio: bocaneri: I'd believe that it would've been hard/tedious to use other software, maybe
11:17  SolomonKull: Liberty =/= Free of cost
11:17  __name__: Psi-Jack: I doubt lspci is fooling me
11:17  Termana: SolomonKull, run my mouth? It was mere discussion
11:17  reisio: totesmuhgoats: maybe, never used it
11:17  totesmuhgoats: i have a laptop that has a few issues with acpi in linux, works in windows. should i just assume it won't work in freebsd either, or is it worth a shot?
11:17  totesmuhgoats: reisio: so what distro do you actually use?
11:17  SolomonKull: Termana: it was seemingly hostil towards my choice of using Free Software.
11:17  bocaneri: Reisio, no, packages like Soldworks and Solid Edge are not available for other platforms, or weren't when I was still in that field.
11:17  SolomonKull: hostile*
11:18  SolomonKull: Termana: what operating system do you use?
11:18  Termana: SolomonKull, where is the business model to sell GPL software (with no extras, just the software)?
11:18  Termana: SolomonKull, also, no not hostile, just thought provoking discussion
11:18  Psi-Jack: totesmuhgoats: For FreeBSD try #Freebsd, not ##linux. As for ACPI issues, new kernel patches and even newer kernel releases have fixes for related laptop ACPI issues you may be having.
11:18  Termana: SolomonKull, I have Linux, OS X and OpenBSD on separate machines
11:19  SolomonKull: Termana: There are no software companies, there are companies that sell services with their software.
11:19  SolomonKull: Termana: so you let programmers starve?  Why woudl you use Linux or BSD, coders are starving.
11:19  SolomonKull: !
11:19  reisio: bocaneri: I'm sure alternatives are, but then you'd have to convince your colleagues to tolerate them :p
11:19  Termana: SolomonKull, no, BSD licenses allow programmers to make money
11:19  SolomonKull: Termana: so does the GPL.
11:19  SolomonKull: Read it before you talk about it.
11:19  totesmuhgoats: Psi-Jack: yea, i was just asking hypothetically. ive tried the latest kernels i time and again
11:20  Termana: SolomonKull, I've read it fine
11:20  bocaneri: Colleagues, bosses, customers, vendors and tons of other people. Yeah, good luck with that.
11:20  Psi-Jack: __name__: Yeah, well, unless I can look up specs for it, I find it near impossible to give any help for it. Since it's an OEM product you might contact your provider and try to work it out with them and either get a replacement, or change of product that actually works with Linux.
11:20  bocaneri: And no, there are no alternatives for these packages even now.
11:20  reisio: totesmuhgoats: I use one of the 3.5 non-silly distros: Debian, Slackware, Gentoo(, Arch)
11:20  Termana: SolomonKull, you cannot make money on the software itself if it is GPL'ed.
11:20  SolomonKull: Termana: yes you can.
11:20  Termana: SolomonKull, I'm sorry maybe I'm not using the correct phrasing. You CAN - but you WONT
11:20  __name__: Psi-Jack: You do not get these products without contracts here.
11:20  SolomonKull: Termana: people do.
11:21  Termana: SolomonKull, when they sell exceptions.
11:21  totesmuhgoats: reisio: which one is only half non silly?
11:22  reisio: totesmuhgoats: I suspect Arch to be non-silly
11:22  reisio: but have less experience with it
11:22  Termana: SolomonKull, no one is making money on selling GPL software (just the software itself) and if they are, I would be glad for you to point me at it
11:22  reisio: it's basically non-derivative, which makes it a million times less silly than a lot of other distros
11:23  PingFloyd: Termana: there is nothing in gpl that says you can't sell for a fee
11:23  PingFloyd: I don't think you understand the gpl
11:23  Termana: PingFloyd, don't throw theory at me, I already said you could
11:24  Termana: But no one is because it isn't practical
11:24  Termana: If I sell a GPL piece of software to 10 people, I can guarantee one of those will take the source I must provide and provide a free version
11:25  Termana: Who will buy my version when you can get it free?
11:25  PingFloyd: Termana: gpl is this in a nutshell--a person can distribute software under it for whatever charge they want, they can make modifications to it too, sell their modification if they want, the heart of GPL is that you can't prevent anyone else from doing the same
11:25  crocket: Termana : You sell support, then.
11:25  Termana: PingFloyd, I understand the GPL
11:25  Termana: crocket, that doesn't work
11:25  Termana: crocket, are you going to sell support with your next major game title?
11:26  pucko_: gpl rules. preserves the right to tinker with stuff
11:26  crocket: Termana : game
11:26  Termana: crocket, you knew what I meant, that doesn't change anything
11:27  PingFloyd: in other words GPL works off fairness--it eliminates the ability to monopolize
11:27  crocket: Termana : It means I get it
11:27  SolomonKull: GPL allows you to write software and then provide a solid service on which to build yoru company.  You dont build a company on software alone, not one single company does except maybe microsoft but they even sell hardware.
11:27  SolomonKull: Red Hat or Novel are prime examples.
11:28  Termana: SolomonKull, Microsoft as well as the example I provided above - game companies
11:28  crocket: But the software has to be big enough to make support demand.
11:28  Termana: Other types of software are sold stand-alone as well
11:28  SolomonKull: Termana: most fo those games sell a service; eg, Servers, support forums, help lines etc.
11:28  Termana: PingFloyd, fairness? You can't buy food with fairness.
11:29  Termana: SolomonKull, you can't charge the same amount for that
11:29  PingFloyd: Termana: food is a consumable item
11:29  PingFloyd: software isn't a consumable item in any way
11:29  SolomonKull: Termana: you can charage whatever you want.
11:29  SolomonKull: ANYTHING.
11:29  PingFloyd: it isn't gone after you use it
11:29  Termana: SolomonKull, remember, the business not only has to pay it's programmers, but it also has to make a profit
11:30  crocket: hmm
11:30  SolomonKull: Termana: companies do it.  If you cannot do it, FIND ANOTHER JOB.
11:30  PingFloyd: food has more in common with fireworks than it does with software
11:30  Termana: SolomonKull, you can, but no one is silly enough to pay $160 for game "support"
11:30  crocket: Is redhat linux subject to GPL?
11:30  pucko_: I find it to be an easy choice, use gpl if you want to else don't.
11:30  Termana: PingFloyd, programmers make money, money buys food
11:30  reisio: no, but Red Hat's Linux is
11:31  SolomonKull: Termana: You *do* realize that artwork in the game does not have to be GPL and therefore you would have a unique product.
11:31  SolomonKull: Right?
11:31  SolomonKull: You know that, righht?
11:31  Termana: crocket, Red Hat contains pieces that are proprietary.
11:31  PingFloyd: Termana: anything has as much value as what everyone puts on it
11:31  PingFloyd: Termana: that's how those pieces of paper in your wallet  work
11:31  ApplePieFromScra: crocket is, same as rhel but no direct support
11:31  ApplePieFromScra: i mean, crocket, centos is
11:32  SolomonKull: Games using the GLP model do not have to give licience to the artwork in the game.  This is how you get a unique GPL game.
11:32  PingFloyd: the game resources can be under a completely different license
11:32  crocket: ApplePieFromScra, I thought you told I was subject to GPL.
11:32  SolomonKull: GPL businesses work in theory, you just cant be an idiot if you wish to succeed.
11:32  nazgjunk: Also, try having a game that's more than a remake of existing concepts ;)
11:33  PingFloyd: same thing with its manuals
11:33  SolomonKull: The music, voice work, art etc.  All non-GPL parts fo the game.
11:33 --- Abracad4br4 is now known as Abracadabra
11:33  crocket: Hmm
11:33  Termana: These seem like all great theories. But where is the actual people making money
11:33  crocket: Drivers can be licensed under GPL.
11:33  fisted: Termana: http://ht.ly/1ZZFL
11:33  SolomonKull: GPL businesses work in theory, you just cant be an idiot if you wish to succeed.
11:33 --- ApplePieFromScra is now known as SedZepplin
11:34  crocket: Intel makes opensource drivers.
11:34  SolomonKull: They do, indeed.
11:34  Termana: crocket, Intel sells chips
11:34  Termana: It's an addition to the software
11:34  Termana: The software is just the side dish
11:35  crocket: But I agree that GPL is not suitable for commercial business most of time.
11:35  SolomonKull: THERE ARE NO SOFTWARE-ONLY COMPANIES that are successful.
11:35 --- SedZepplin is now known as AwkingHeads
11:35  SolomonKull: Name one.
11:35  SolomonKull: Just one.
11:35  Termana: SolomonKull, Microsoft
11:35  SolomonKull: They sell hardware/
11:35  SolomonKull: Next?
11:35  reisio: GPL is an odd but not impossible choice for hustlers
11:35  fisted: they didnt sell HW all the time.
11:35  reisio: for companies providing an actual _service_, it's a perfect choice
11:35  SolomonKull: fisted: they do now.
11:35  fisted: SolomonKull: irrelevant since they had success before.
11:36  SolomonKull: fisted: 20+ years ago, before they put money into IBM.
11:36  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: again ga
11:36  TermanaDesire: Game companies
11:36  fisted: SolomonKull: still irrelevant^
11:36  AwkingHeads: none of these are as clever as pingfloyd
11:36  SolomonKull: They provide a service - tech support, forums, help call centers, voice chat networks etc.
11:36  bocaneri: The preponderance of MS' income, I believe, would be from software or services surrounding it.
11:36  fisted: agree game companies might be a better example
11:37  SolomonKull: They provide a service - tech support, forums, help call centers, voice chat networks etc.  ALL games on modern consoles come with this.
11:37  bocaneri: EDS (formerly Unigraphics) would also fit the "software-only" bill, as would also Autodesk.
11:37  SolomonKull: Find me a multip[layer FPS that does not have voice, a store *inside* the game etc.
11:37  bocaneri: There are others, I'm just too tired to think them up.
11:37  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: illumination software creation station
11:38  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: mIRC
11:38 --- AwkingHeads is now known as ApplePieFromScra
11:38  SolomonKull: TermanaDesire: Bryan sells Illumination.
11:38  reisio: if you include selling software in 'software' :p
11:38  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: that was a silly response i know who sells it
11:38  bocaneri: The point is, SolomonKull, unless you can tell me what Unigraphics even IS, you can't make a case with me that there are no software-only companies.
11:38  SolomonKull: Its a 2 man team, they do NOT make a living off of Illumination, or Radical Comics or any opther app they made.  Its a one app deal they dont live off of it.  Jesus.
11:39  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: bryan also agrees there is no business model with the gpl
11:39  SolomonKull: bocaneri: I said they exist, but are rare and you must not be an idiot if you wish to succeed with a software-only company.
11:40  fisted: SolomonKull: actually you said they didnt exist..
11:40  devendra: Please check the script http://pastebin.com/iNTVhcMD and tell me why the output is not line by line. When I fire the command directly in shell, it gives line by line output but using it through script gives mess.
11:40  SolomonKull: TermanaDesire: so?  He's not an authority on anything, he's a guy who sits in front of a camera for an hour a week.  Big deal.
11:40  SolomonKull: fisted: no, I demanded that you name at least one company that is software only,.
11:41  bocaneri: I've just named several, and I don't know a damn thing about the companies that make games.
11:41  fisted: SolomonKull: lol. if you cannot see the implications of that message.. okay.
11:41  reisio: who is talking about games...
11:41  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: remind me again what hardware microsoft maakea that runs windows?
11:41  bocaneri: hey, games are software too, you know!
11:41  TermanaDesire: Makes*
11:42  SolomonKull: TermanaDesire: I never claimed Microsoft made hardware that ran windows.  They do, however, make the Xbox, keyboards, mice and a shitload of other gadgets.
11:42  fisted: <     SolomonKull > THERE ARE NO SOFTWARE-ONLY COMPANIES that are successful.
11:42  fisted: btw
11:42  SolomonKull: "...that are successful."
11:42  fisted: stop struggeling
11:42  SolomonKull: Straw men fall easy, m'lady.
11:42  bocaneri: I've named several, and I don't know a damn thing about the companies that make games, which leads me to believe you hvae no idea what the field is like.
11:43  TermanaDesire: SolomonKull: dont be silly. Microsoft are not depending on "other gadgets" for their profit. They make money on windows and office
11:43  SolomonKull: TermanaDesire: the real money is Xbox, these days.
11:43  TermanaDesire: And not the support provided around those
11:43  fisted: and on selling their souls to the devil
11:45  __name__: Psi-Jack: I think lspci has fooled me
11:46 * bagira just realized that his distro is substandard :(
11:46  __name__: It's a E1550
11:46  __name__: *lsusb
11:47  bocaneri: Oh, bagira, don't tell me you're running ubuntu, too...
11:47  Psi-Jack: __name__: I don't see that at all, either.
11:47  bagira: bocaneri, no, lord no.  Slackware.
11:47  Psi-Jack: Not even recommendations.
11:47  bocaneri: I've actually heard people speak very highly of slack.
11:47  bagira: bocaneri, its good for just getting stuff to work.  if you need that.
11:48  loomsen: bocaneri: like, 10 years ago?
11:48  __name__: Psi-Jack: that one exists
11:48  bocaneri: Just a few days ago, in fact, by somebody who impresses me as being able to walk and chew gum at the same time.
11:48  bagira: bocaneri, its kind of....thrown together
11:49  Psi-Jack: __name__: Heh, all I get for that in non-English is cyrllic fonts I can't even come close to reading. ;)
11:49  bocaneri: If you want something that's build like a tank, you either need one of the bsd's or you need debian.
11:49  bagira: paths aren't paid very good attention to, the base packages aren't debugged, etc
11:49  bagira: yeah i LOVED freebsd
11:50  bagira: i just need proprietary ATI support
11:50  bocaneri: Buh bye fbsd :(
11:50  fedorauser162: anyone an idea why i keep getting this error when burning an iso?  http://pastebin.com/7hW9dHW7
11:50  bagira: freebsd was a dream until i bought a graphics card worth using
11:52  Psi-Jack: Yeah, and bubye Linux too, ATI == Bleh.
11:52  SolomonKull: You Windows fanboys...bleh.
11:52  SolomonKull: <oswar></oswar>
11:52  bocaneri: I can't tell you right now which of which I have, but I have both nvidia and ati machines and they're all running very nicely. My little netbook, though, is slower than frozen molasses.
11:53  bagira: meh?  I get --great-- ati support in linux.  it just took forever for ATI to make the driver.
11:53  bagira: the FOSS drivers, though, will be great when my card is 30 years old.
11:53  SolomonKull: Intel works.
11:53  bagira: though, once again, there's issues with the installation process on slackware because of path deviances.
11:54  bagira: driver installation^
11:54  SolomonKull: I always ask Slackware users, why Slackware?  What redeeming quality does it have that other, more popular distros offer?
11:54  mAniAk-_-: -use-the-force-luke=bufsize:4m <-- wat
11:55  bagira: SolomonKull, if you really want to know, because it's hard to screw up slackware.
11:55  bagira: i install ubuntu, i've ruined the system within the week.
11:55  crocket: SolomonKull, Slackware users appreciate manual configuration
11:56  bagira: ^ why it's hard to screw up
11:56  bocaneri: mAniAk-_-, I once wrote a QLB for a friend who wanted to include mouse actions with his QuickBasic programs, and the docs I wrote included terms like "mickeys". I included such terms because the documentation I had for the mouse drivers used such terms. Cracked my friend right up. Mickey Mouse, geddit?
11:56  mAniAk-_-: so basically slackware users are screwups
11:57  mAniAk-_-: bocaneri: xD
11:57  bagira: quite the contrary; we want to configure everything ourselves because developers for other distros are screwups
11:57  bagira: maintainers* *whiskey
12:00  bagira: mAniAk-_-, all that automagic shit for linux, it's almost always fragile.  one little hiccup and critical systems admnistration job is botched and all you have is more automagic tools to fix it with, and half the time those don't do what they're supposed to.
12:01  bagira: otherwise we'd all be using ubuntu linux.
12:01  bocaneri: The alternative is what happened to me just a handful of hours ago, mis-typed a single IP and found I couldn't sshfs any of my machines together. Took hours to find.
12:01  bagira: ha
12:02  bagira: well another reason i haven't switched is because i demand being able to add build options to my binary packages after creating them from a source build; i've been told you can do that in archlinux but not in centos or fedora
12:21  PingFloyd: lol, "the FOSS drivers, though, will be great when my card is 30 years old."
12:22  PingFloyd: Yeah, and Slackware is good, but it does feel like you've traveled back in time when you use it.
12:30  reisio: PingFloyd: nothing compared to using a BSD
12:31  PingFloyd: lol, aren't some of the BSDs still using XFree86?
12:31  SolomonKull: PC-BSD feels modern, on the surface.
12:32  PingFloyd: SolomonKull: until you bite into its old crusty core?
12:33  mrcarrot: i really like openbsd... but then i am maybe a bit oldish. at least it is more stable than the new and modern linuxes
12:34  mrcarrot: but it is not for everybody... different needs, different os
12:34  reisio: PingFloyd: they're still using vi
12:34  PingFloyd: It's not hard to be stable if you only care about supporting decade old hardware though
12:34  reisio: mmm, OpenBSD is loverly
12:36  mrcarrot: PingFloyd: that is trolling... they support very well new hardware too.
12:36  PingFloyd: reisio: what was it we were saying yesterday about the term troll?
12:41  mrcarrot: what i mean is that i am using both linux and openbsd, so i know that the hardware support is not as bad as you say. i bet you never tried any bsd recently. you even have to really search to find a 10+ year old equipment and all computers i have been trying openbsd on has been working well. even on a shiny new i7 computer at work
12:47  gordboy: does openbsd still have punched cards ?
12:48  hiptobecubic: PingFloyd, what's wrong with Slackware :D
12:48  mAniAk-_-: for ram yes gordboy
12:50  gordboy: i hear that timesharing on openbsd is mandatory. everyone has to take turns pedalling
12:57  crocket: hmm
12:57  crocket: Slackware64 13.1 USB bootimage has syslinux 3.84, and syslinux 3.84 can't boot up on my ATOM server.
12:58  crocket: oops]
12:59  mrcarrot: i am using plain 32-bit slackware to avoid problems :)
13:00  PingFloyd: 32-bit is the future!
13:04  heftig: is there software to convert an .ICM color profile to an .ICC one?
13:04  Vutral: can google search binary strings ?
13:05  Vutral: ^^
13:11  ne2k: just got and installed ubuntu maverick on a new PC. installed NTP to keep clock in sync but it keeps running fast, by a couple of minutes every hour. NTP never actually locks on to a server (no * in ntpq -p). I've never had this problem before. what can I do to debug it further?
13:22  jimbauwens: Hello, i want to setup a VPN server in a virtual machine. Does anyone know if there is already a ready availeble distro for that?
13:23  ne2k: jimbauwens: you could look for firewall/router type distros
13:23  Ykstort: where can i find information on how to report bugs to the kernel people? (mainline kernel causes X to crash where stable doesnt, something about MMIO aperture and then a segfault)
13:23  ne2k: jimbauwens: routeros from mikrotik is not free but is very good
13:24  jimbauwens: ok
13:24  ne2k: jimbauwens: there's monowall, which is BSD rather than linux
13:24  jimbauwens: I'll check it out
13:24  lautriv_: Ykstort, sure it is kernel-related, what errors, what distro ?
13:24  ne2k: jimbauwens: tbh, any small linux with openswan/openvpn packages ought to work
13:25  Ykstort: lautriv_, i figure it's kernel related because the only thing changed was the kernel
13:25  jimbauwens: ne2k, yes, i was thinking tinycore
13:25  Ykstort: kernel A runs X fine but X crashes on kernel B
13:26  Ykstort: kernel B is a release candidate so likely to be buggy
13:26  jimbauwens: ne2k, on the website of openvpn they have a vmware image
13:26  Ykstort: kernel A is the current stable kernel
13:26  lautriv_: Ykstort, that is not even close, the message itself counts
13:26  Ykstort: yeah i forget exactly what it is
13:26  yano: you can't generate public key pairs with the openssl command, correct?
13:27  lautriv_: Ykstort, my .37-rc3 runs fine, so what about your userland ?
13:27  Ykstort: first there's an error from X subsystem r128 graphics driver (EE) coudlnt allocate MMIO apperture and then X segfaults
13:27  ne2k: jimbauwens: you need to decide whether you want to run IPSec or OpenVPN or both
13:27  Ykstort: lautriv_, the bug is in the kernel but doesnt affect your userland probably
13:27  jimbauwens: ne2k, just openVPN would be ok
13:28  EdwardIII: hey, how can i use 'find' to return two different kinds of files, e.g. *.html and *.php?
13:28  Ykstort: lautriv_, it may be more complicated than that
13:28  EdwardIII: tried using regex but i don't think it was pcre, i couldn't go this|that
13:28  crocket: Please anybody help me deal with the error message "syslinux 3.84 3.84 cbios load error - boot error" that occurs when I boot slackware64 13.1 usb bootimage on my ATOM-cpu server.
13:28  lautriv_: Ykstort, i see only a bad alloc, are you even sure you configured proper and ACPI is well done ?
13:28  koala_man: EdwardIII: -name '*.php' -o -name '*.html'
13:28  EdwardIII: ah, thanks koala_man
13:29  Ykstort: i think so
13:29  EdwardIII: hrm also i just accidently hit a keyboard combo and now my left hand servers pane has disappeared, any idea how to get it back?
13:29  lautriv_: Ykstort, don't think, check it.
13:29  PingFloyd: Ykstort: that doesn't necessarily mean its the kernel.  There's a very close relationship between the kernel, X, and video driver
13:29  jimbauwens: ne2k, I think I will use the openVPN image.
13:29  EdwardIII: ah wait, it got seperated out into another window. i've somehow orphaned ##linux from the rest of x-chat
13:29  Ykstort: the kernel is the only thing that changed though
13:29  PingFloyd: Ykstort: change one of those 3 things and the other two may need to be updated
13:30  Ykstort: right
13:30  PingFloyd: Ykstort: what you want to do is a bit of testing to make sure it was the kernel upgrade that triggered the problems.  Then submit a bug report
13:30  Ykstort: my video driver is legacy :(
13:31  Ykstort: PingFloyd, k. name a test
13:31  PingFloyd: a bug report won't be of much use without some analysis and information
13:31  Ykstort: well thats what i came here to learn
13:31  PingFloyd: Ykstort: like try loading the old kernel again and see if it everything works like before
13:31  Ykstort: i knew i couldnt just tell them some basic story
13:31  Ykstort: ive already done that
13:33  Ykstort: alls working fine right now
13:33  Ykstort: on the other kernel
13:33  Ykstort: but on the one kernel
13:33  PingFloyd: Ykstort: ok, that's good
13:33  Ykstort: well ill check again
13:33  lautriv_: Ykstort, you know .37 has changed headers ?
13:33  PingFloyd: Ykstort: now try to look for relevant information in the log
13:33  PingFloyd: the idea is that the more pertinent information you can provide in your bug report the better
13:33  Ykstort: yeah
13:33  PingFloyd: if you're not sure, just make the bug report, I'm sure one of them will have some questions and ask you to check a few things
13:34  PingFloyd: is the problem with the distro kernel image? or the vanilla kernel?
13:34  Ykstort: i run vanilla
13:34  PingFloyd: then you want to submit to upstream
13:34  lautriv_: Ykstort, what toolchain ?
13:35  PingFloyd: Ykstort: this might be helpful http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
13:35  Ykstort: lautriv_, sorry i dont quite follow
13:35  Ykstort: i used make
13:35  Ykstort: is that what you mean?
13:35  lautriv_: Ykstort, which version of gcc and even some userland like udev count'S on kernel-versions.
13:36  PingFloyd: here's the key thing, which you did, "If it occurs repeatably try and
13:36  PingFloyd: describe how to recreate it. That is worth even more than the oops itself."
13:36  Ykstort: oh gcc of course, ive got 4.5.1-2
13:36  discozohan: Hello! Is there a way to see configuration command that i used while installing some software ? Mysql server, for example ?
13:36  PingFloyd: sounds like you covered that.  So that is good
13:37 * lautriv_ facepalms
13:37  Ykstort: i get my gcc from the good people of arch linux
13:38  PingFloyd: arch likes to throw in experimental crap
13:38  EdwardIII: people in here love arch with all their heart it seems
13:38  Ykstort: that's not helpful in this situation
13:41  Cap_J_L_Picard: arch is an experimenters distro so...
13:43  EdwardIII: is it?
13:44 * EdwardIII uses fedora for the rpm toolchain
13:44  peterius: hi, my sound stopped working recently and I've tried pretty much everything and still can't fix it
13:44  lautriv_: peterius, details ?
13:44  peterius: anyone know what is supposed to be in /proc/asound/card0/codec97 ...?
13:44  peterius: after many days and many hours, I got the headphone line jack sense mute button in alsamixer to make a noise, but then it stopped
13:45  peterius: I don't even think I changed anything
13:46  lautriv_: peterius, details ?
13:46  Cap_J_L_Picard: peterius: soundcard? kernel version? what exactly happened?
13:46  Cap_J_L_Picard: disto?
13:46  EdwardIII: i've got a file containing a list of files with spaces in the name - i want to run grep on each one. i tried using xargs but i get 'argument list too long'. this doesn't handle the spaces in the filenames properly: for f in `cat /tmp/output`; do grep scgi-bin "$f"; done;
13:46  EdwardIII: any tips?
13:47  peterius: well I can give you all the details in the world but if you don't know what I'm talking about with the codec file you probably can't help me
13:47  peterius: its gentoo, ac97 onboard it works fine with windows xp
13:47  peterius: kernel is 35, but I've tried others, it was definitely working before
13:47  peterius: alsa is 1.0.23, alsaconf doesn't work, alsactl init says "initializing using generic method"
13:47  Obvious: EdwardIII, try setting IFS="" before
13:47  Halabund: is there a way to display the time at the bash command propmt?
13:47  peterius: alsamixer is all maxed out
13:48  Halabund: so I know what time different commands were started at
13:48  Cap_J_L_Picard: peterius: seperately installed alsa libs, or kernel install?
13:48  peterius: separately
13:48  peterius: I assumed at first it was an alsalib kernel conflict but no one seemed to know anything about that
13:48  lautriv_: peterius, AC97 sits behind a chopset, did you load that modules and snd-core ?
13:48  lautriv_: *chip
13:48  EdwardIII: Obvious, bizarrely that produces 'argument list too long'
13:49  EdwardIII: Obvious, what does that do?
13:49  Obvious: EdwardIII, stops splitting lines into words
13:49  Cap_J_L_Picard: lautriv_: wouldn't get alsa-mixer if he didn't.
13:49  peterius: what chipset is that?  I've tried recompiling kernel numerous times with different drivers, in case it needed usb sound for some reason, the thing is, it did used to work before alsa 1.0.23 and moreover, I got that noise from the headphone jack sense
13:49  EdwardIII: ah, Obvious - but the problem is /tmp/output contains a lot of lines -- too many to include on the command line
13:49  Cap_J_L_Picard: peterius: depends on the motherboard.
13:49  Obvious: Halabund,  \t     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
13:49  lautriv_: Cap_J_L_Picard, for the core yes but not neccessary for the chip.
13:49  EdwardIII: Obvious, otherwise i could just grep <term> `cat /tmp/output`
13:50  EdwardIII: Obvious, or use xargs (which gets around the spaces-in-filenames problem)
13:50  peterius: that codec file in /proc has a bunch of 0s in it, so I wonder if that's the problem but I don't know what the file is
13:50  Halabund: Obvious, what is the name of the env var I need to change
13:50  Obvious: EdwardIII, IFS="" for ...
13:51  crocket: hmm
13:51  EdwardIII: Obvious, that produces 'too many args' error - unless that was meant for Halabund?
13:51  Obvious: EdwardIII, err. try IFS="\n" for f in `...
13:51 --- JonathanS is now known as JonathanD
13:52 --- Damianz is now known as Damian
13:52  lautriv_: peterius, paste lspci and lsusb
13:52  EdwardIII: that has weird results, Obvious - seems that characters before and after the \n have been chomped
13:53  Obvious: EdwardIII, also, xargs -a yourfile
13:53  peterius: lautriv_: do you know what that codec file is?
13:53  lautriv_: peterius, there are several, depending on your chipset.
13:53  EdwardIII: Obvious, that produces 'argument list too long'
13:54  EdwardIII: Obvious, that's why i stopped using xargs - i was using it before but it runs into that problem
13:54  peterius: lautriv_: what?  so what is it?  How do I alter it?
13:54  EdwardIII: although xargs -a is good to know, saves piping it through sed to remove the newlines in the case when the list isn't quite so long
13:55  Obvious: EdwardIII, and --max-args=
13:55  lautriv_: peterius, check lspci, ensure this module loads, some of them requiring an additional one b/c the codec behind ac97
13:55  EdwardIII: Obvious, but isn't the restriction being imposed by bash rather than xargs?
13:57  peterius: lautriv_: well Cap_J_L_Picard said I wouldn't get alsamixer if that was the issue, and like I said twice before, I got the headphone jack sense to make a noise in addition to having working sound before alsa 1.0.23 so pretty sure its just the configuration of alsa or the libs
13:57  koala_man: EdwardIII: argument list too long? that used to be imposed by the kernel, but since 2.6.30something it's been dramatically increased
13:58  EdwardIII: koala_man, i've got a \n seperated list of a load of files, i want to run 'grep' on each one
13:58  lautriv_: peterius, searching errors is done from ground up and not from top down.
13:58  EdwardIII: koala_man, if i try and loop with 'for' i get problems because some of the files have spaces in the name. if i use xargs i get 'arg. list too long'
13:59  koala_man: wtf? how are you using xargs to get that?
14:00  peterius: lautriv_: well even if that made sense, I've already checked that so... again, if you don't know much about that codec file, you probably can't help me
14:02  koala_man: EdwardIII: tr '\n' '\0' < file | xargs -0 grep foo
14:04  EdwardIII: hrm that does the trick, thanks koala_man
14:04  EdwardIII: koala_man, what is \0?
14:06  Diverdude: What command do i use to see processor specs?
14:06  EdwardIII: Diverdude, cat /proc/cpuinfo
14:07  Cap_J_L_Picard: EdwardIII: null character C escape sequence....
14:07  Diverdude: EdwardIII, and to see available memory?
14:08  Cap_J_L_Picard: EdwardIII: IIRC
14:08  EdwardIII: Diverdude, free -m (for megabytes)
14:09  EdwardIII: Cap_J_L_Picard, ah
14:18  terabit: hey guys i have an ext4 fs and i may have run into a situation where i might be requiring more than 32000 sub-directories in a single directory. does ext4 support unlimited sub-directories by default? and how can i find out if this feature is turned on ?
14:20 * jelly wonders what sort of a broken app might *require* such a directory structure
14:20  lautriv_: terabit, for i in{0..35000}; do mkdir -p /test/dir$i;done
14:21  terabit: jelly: not broken,mirroring a website.
14:22  jelly: well, you'd typically mirror the backend storage, which would be on a similar filesystem...
14:23  terabit: lautriv_: i'm already running the program i guess i will find out soon enough. i just thought i should ask if there was some sort of a command i don't know about that will tell me the fs parameters.
14:23  jelly: unless you're GETting it all
14:23  rethus: i have extract a big zip-file in the wrong folder.
14:23  rethus: is there a way to undo tall the createt ffiles ?
14:23  rethus: maybe with the actual day?
14:24  terabit: jelly: just certain type of data files. and it's not my website it's a public website that maybe going down.
14:25  jelly: "it wasn't a DDoS, said wikileaks sysadmin, it was just a bunch of people trying to download all of our site at the same time"
14:27  lautriv_: terabit, i removed all my ext4 for stability reasons but if you are in doubt, XFS can handle that amount.
14:27  rethus: i try find ./ -mtime 0 but didn't show the right files.
14:27  rethus: how can i use minutes for mtime?
14:27  rethus: instead of tdays
14:31  PingFloyd: -mmin
14:31  lautriv_: rethus, you can't it's always n*24h , ls -a | cut may help
14:31  rethus: lautriv_: mtime -0 show the wrong files
14:31  rethus: i'll show you
14:31  rethus: the folder http://pastebin.com/8TFbYabw
14:32  rethus: mtime-command: http://pastebin.com/mmpvh3eU
14:33  terabit: jelly: i wasn't talking about wikileaks but since you brought it up,i was trying to mirror that too and it turns out i've been accidentally mirroring twitter too in addition to wikileaks
14:33  rethus: all files wich are user root are newone
14:33  rethus: but i see thee problem now
14:34  lautriv_: rethus, it's -mtime 0 NOT mtime -0 and you may use mmin instead like PingFloyd also mentioned.
14:34  terabit: jelly:wikileaks have a far more organized directory structure
14:34  jelly: terabit: heh, don't read too much into my lame joke
14:35  rethus: i have used -mtime 0
14:35  rethus: and -mmin 0 doesn't output anything
14:35  PingFloyd: rethus: think about what you're telling it
14:39  rethus: but this may cause the file-creationdata is not set to the datetime where the zip is extractet.
14:39  PingFloyd: zero days have passed, zero minutes have passed.
14:39  PingFloyd: you've been in here longer than 59 seconds
14:39  rethus: i know, what the parameter means. see my pastebin... the files are extractet before 5 monutes, but the created-day is set to which is set in the zipfile themself
14:39  rethus: you know wht i mean
14:39  PingFloyd: stat one of the files and see what it shows for modified time
14:39  rethus: stat FAQ.txt
14:39  rethus: Modify: 2008-11-10 11:25:44.000000000 +0100
14:39  rethus: Change: 2010-11-29 14:22:45.000000000 +0100
14:40  rethus: so, "find ./ -mmin 20" should give me all ffiles wich older than 20 Minutes?
14:41  PingFloyd: between 20 and 21 minutes since last modified I think
14:41  extor: The MAC address of my RealTEK NIC just turned to all FFF. What do? http://oi55.tinypic.com/21liye1.jpg
14:42  rethus: PingFloyd: so, -mmin give me nothing back
14:42  terabit: extor: i think you can use macchanger to change it if you want but it shouldn't be all fff
14:42  PingFloyd: probably <21 and >=20 unless you specify otherwise
14:42  Psi-Jack: extor: Yep. Means it's not working.
14:42  extor: terabit, I'm thinking the hardware possibly fried? Cuz the whole box locked up and then when I rebooted the MAC was all FFS when it was trying to do a PXE boot as well
14:43  Psi-Jack: extor: Lemme guess, RTL-8169?
14:43  PingFloyd: probably just looks at the minutes field in other words
14:43  extor: Psi-Jack, yes RTL embedded, how did you know?
14:43  rethus: is there a way to delete all files where owner is "xy" ?
14:43  Psi-Jack: extor: Netgear or something else?
14:43  extor: Psi-Jack, and is there an RTL fix for this?
14:43  extor: Psi-Jack, you recommend I drop another NIC in there?
14:44  PingFloyd: in your find expression you can change that though
14:44  Psi-Jack: extor: I have the problem between two very similar Netgear GigaNICs, myself, but that's only when I do bonding.
14:44  terabit: extor: or kernel/module issue. maybe your kernel is corrupt somehow or is very outdated. what version is it?
14:45  extor: terabit, its the centos 5.5 latest Xen kernel
14:45  Psi-Jack: extor: Soon as I ripped out the secondary netgear, replacing it with a Trendnet, paired with the secondary Netgear, it... Seems fine.
14:45  extor: lemme see if rebooting it does much
14:45  Psi-Jack: But yeah, CentOS 5.5 is an older kernel..
14:45  Psi-Jack: extor: So, you will have issues with RTL-8169.
14:45  terabit: extor: why don't you unload /reload the driver
14:45  Psi-Jack: extor: There IS a patched kernel module for it, though in the elrepo repository.
14:46  extor: terabit, uhmmm cuz it had all FFFFFS before it went to the OS
14:46  extor: why is this a kernel issue? It's all FFFF when it's trying to PXE boot also
14:46  Psi-Jack: extor: It's a kernel module issue with that driver.
14:46  terabit: extor: didn't realize that. then maybe it's a hardware/firmware issue
14:46  extor: Psi....this happens before I even hit the operating system
14:47  Psi-Jack: extor: I know.
14:47  Psi-Jack: extor: elrepo has a patched rtl-8169 module.
14:47  Psi-Jack: May or may not fix it, though with the 2.6.18 kernel, but you can always try.
14:47  extor: well I cannot reach that cuz my network is down lawl
14:47  Psi-Jack: extor: Ever heard of sneakernet?
14:48  Fieldy: or gasp even a remotely recent kernel
14:48  Psi-Jack: Fieldy: CentOS == older kernel.
14:48  axle3d: am transferring large files over smb, any tool, that i can use to resume on network interruption (which keeps happening)
14:48  Psi-Jack: Get used to it. ;)
14:48  Fieldy: could very well have the issue resolved
14:48  extor: Psi-Jack, no what does sneakernet do?
14:48  Fieldy: axle3d: use rsync to transfer, mount the smb stuff with smbmount, treat it like a local directory. the rsync options -aPv will probably be best for you, but rad the man page.
14:50  Psi-Jack: extor: Back in the day, it's where you took a floppy, put stuff on it, used your sneakers to walk to the other computer, floppy in hand, and put it into the other computer.

14:50  Psi-Jack: extor: Okay, well, either it'll be a LOOOOOONG walk, or you'll have to get the datacenter guys to do it.
14:51  Psi-Jack: And if this is in a datacenter, you got jipped, man.
14:51  Psi-Jack: RTL-8169 isn't server-grade hardware.
14:52  extor: Its a desktop mobo that I put there myself
14:52  Psi-Jack: Then you fsck'd yourself and sent off a computer to be useless. :P

15:01  Dominian: remote kvm's aren't cheap
15:01  jelly: extor: well, it can be cheap in pricing, compared to buying decent server-level hardware with included remote mgt features, and cheap in featureset
15:01 * extor shrugs
15:05  Psi-Jack: Heck, you can get a DRAC for as much as you can get a KVMoIP.

15:12  lautriv_: jelly, the one inventing the abbreviations ;-)
15:12  jelly: extor: HP has iLO; Sun has ALOM; IBM has... can't remember.  They all do pretty much the same thing, KVM, power, booting (think .iso images) over IP.
15:12  extor: well my KVM is an external switch with SIP cables and the whole works. It's "l33t"
15:12  Vutral: ey
15:12  jelly: extor: my rule of thumb is, if you have to go over there, it's not l33t enough.
15:12  Vutral: can someone provide a statically linked lilo for amd64 please
15:12  PingFloyd: maybe instead of wasting that money on the KVM, you should have put it toward a decent NIC
15:12  extor: it's l33t when combined with my remote access PDU. Together we can battle anything
15:13 * lautriv_ remembers the time this channel had far above 1k users, now it's below 500 :-(
15:13  extor: PingFloyd, I have a decent NIC in there...but it's not hooked up. It's a broadcom
15:13  extor: I just asked the datacenter guy to go hook that NIC up to my switch
15:13  extor: So I'm going to be back in business pretty soon hopefully

15:14  jelly: mAniAk-_-: compared to a budget RTL chip? Sure
15:14  extor: mAniAk-_-, broadcom is used by tyan in their server boards
15:14  extor: Im sure others use it too such as supermicro
15:16  lautriv_: extor, but unfortunately the most on-board broadcoms are those not supporting jumbo-frames.
15:16  jelly: my HPs all have bcom chips with decent features (tcp offload; jumbo frames; dot1q)
15:16  Fieldy: you could always add in a card of your choosing
15:16  jelly: lautriv_: that might be true for supermicro boards
15:16  extor: lautriv_, my broadcom isa Gigabit NetXtreme and I'm sure it supports jumbo frames
15:16  extor: Fieldy, the broadcom was of my own choosing

15:19  draeath: Anyone got some lower level ext4 experience? Do you know if the superblock backups are in the same positions as with ext2 and ext3?
15:19  CodeNinja: is there a limit to how many logical partitions a drive can have? I have a 1.5TB drive, I split into 8, 50GB sections, 1 450, 1 100 and 2 250 partitions. sdb16 and 17 are not shown in /dev/ and when I try to mount them it says theres a bad superblock
15:19  lautriv_: extor, no jumbo.
15:19  jelly: 5706; 5708; 5709 -- all have 9k frame support
15:19  lautriv_: but not 5751
15:19  extor: jelly, and 5751 does not???

15:19  CodeNinja: draeath: GPT/EFI?
15:19  extor: ok so what's a decent NIC then?
15:19  extor: jelly, if you did then how would you check? Anything in Linux I can do?
15:19  Psi-Jack: Yeah, I have a BCM 5721 in my primary NAS server.

15:21  jelly: extor: well, in my case all the HP Proliant models that have them onboard state those features.  If I had to check, I'd look at the broadcom specs somewhere
15:22  CodeNinja: draeath: I assume the 63 would also apply to sata too yes?

With an MTU of 1500 bytes (MSS of 1460), TCP throughput will have an upper bound of about 6.5 Mbps! And no, that is not a window size limitation, but rather one based on TCP's ability to detect and recover from congestion (loss)....
15:29  PingFloyd: ...With 9000 byte frames, TCP throughput could reach about 40 Mbps. "

15:51  gdoteof: is there anything i can do to set up a sort of 'virtual network' environment?  i want to be able to run a beta of our production server as it's qualified domain name
15:52  gdoteof: we have been just setting it up at a subdomain like beta.oursite.com
15:52  gdoteof: but i'd like to be able to vnc somewhere and just have a www.oursite.com that is accessible only within that vnc
15:52  grawity: Technically, "www" is a subdomain too.
15:52  gdoteof: grawity: yeah
15:52  gdoteof: my point is that i want the beta version to act in every way like the real version
15:53  extor: gdoteof, virtual switch
15:53  grawity: You could edit /etc/hosts, for example, to point "oursite.com" and "www.oursite.com" to the test server
15:53  grawity: It will only affect your own box, though
15:53  Bartzy: Can I know if some file is in the kernel cache ?
15:53  gdoteof: grawity: that's not what i want.  I want the site itself to think of itself as 'www.domain.com'
15:53  Bartzy: or if the system just served the file from the kernel cache or from the disk ?
15:54  grawity: gdoteof: then just configure it to do so
15:54  grawity: gdoteof: but it won't be useful if you cannot reach it by typing that hostname
15:54  gdoteof: 'just configure it'
15:54  gdoteof: grawity: .. i don't think you understand my problem
15:55  grawity: I tend to suck at that, yes
15:55  gdoteof: like i said.  I want to have a whole virtual network that i can vnc into.  within that network I want a www.domain.com
15:55  gdoteof: but outsideof that network www.domain.com resolves to the 'real' site
15:55  gdoteof: pretty much, i want to emulate the production environment as much as possible
15:56  gdoteof: doens't have to be vnc.  i wouldn't mind tunneling port 80 through some other host or whatever
15:56  grawity: hm, so you want a network (I guess 'VPN', not 'VNC') in which "www.domain.com" resolves to the test site?
15:56  gdoteof: yes I guess that's what I want
15:58  grawity: I still don't understand why it has to be a whole separate network...
15:59  grawity: But, you could set up OpenVPN and a DNS server on some spare box
15:59  grawity: And make that DNS server resolve "www" to the test site.
15:59  gdoteof: maybe it doesn't.  the problem is that our production environment is a hodgepodge of hacks, some of which rely on the site being the fully qualified domain that it is
15:59  grawity: The end result is mostly the same that you would get by temporarily editing your own /etc/hosts, just in more steps
16:00  gdoteof: ie if you stick the same environment on beta.domain.com it breaks
16:00  gdoteof: but if you stick the environmetn on domain.com or www.domain.com it works
16:00  gdoteof: currently our beta site is just at beta.domain.com and the things that break are expected to break
16:00  gdoteof: does that make sense?
16:00  gdoteof: why editing my host file isn't sufficient?
16:01  grawity: not really :( I still think that if you 1) configured beta site to think it was "www.domain.com", and 2) configured your own computer to access beta site when you typed "www.domain.com" ...
16:04  grawity: eh, I give up
16:04  gdoteof: ok.  i think i need to research 'configure beta site to think it is not beta site'  thanks grawity

17:03  greg3000: hi,  I'm transferring my files from one remote virtual server to another, what command should I use to clear the old remote server from private data?
17:03  greg3000: would it just be a "rm / -rf" ?
17:05  katoen: hmm.. that will render the machine unusable, if rm would at all allow your to perform such an action.
17:05  katoen: why not deleting just the directory where your private data is stored
17:05  depesz: greg3000: if the data is really private - use some toold like secure-delete or wipe.
17:05  depesz: greg3000: if t's not really sensitive, then just mkfs the disk, and you're done.
17:05  greg3000: katoen: sure, I'm not 100% sure about where it all would be.. I know there's some in /etc.
17:06  greg3000: depesz: thanks for the tips, mkfs on the /dev/md1 perhaps?
17:07  greg3000: basically I didn't want to run a command that would cause the system to fail when it was 50% done.  it's sensitive data only by protocol because it belongs to a company
17:08  katoen: so this is a remote machine then? hmm. creating a new filesystem is an option, but it will not erase every bit on the disk. For that you could use the dd tool
17:09  greg3000: ok, so I'll "dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/md1" (assuming md1 is the device with sensitive data)
17:09  katoen: /dev/zero
17:09  greg3000: thanks :)
17:10  katoen: and, yes, that will overwrite the partition with zeros
17:11  greg3000: now it's just getting the courage to hit the execute button, lol

17:20  knittl: hi. how can i break a hardlink?
17:21 --- centosian_ is now known as centosian
17:22  katoen: unlink or rm will remove the link to the inode. If there are no hardlinks left, the content of the file is lost.
17:22  knittl: katoen: i want to turn a hardlink into a copy
17:22  katoen: you want to copy teh content of the file into another file
17:23  knittl: i guess cp file file will not work
17:23  katoen: cp file file2
17:23  knittl: i do: ln orig link
17:23  knittl: no i decide that link should be a copy
17:23  knittl: i don't know where orig is anymore (could be anywere)
17:23 * katoen scratches head
17:23  knittl: cp link copy && rm link; ?
17:24  katoen: ln will do that just, create a link to the actual inode. This means one copy of the actual data, and 2 pointers to it.
17:24  katoen: so if you want a copy of the content, you use "cp" and give it a new name (for you can't have the same name in any given directory)
17:24  knittl: katoen: um yes, i know that. how will that solve my problem?
17:25  knittl: so i have to use cp link copy && rm link; ?
17:25  katoen: there is no such concept of "original". Both names point to one inode
17:25  armence: Hello all. I just only now extracted an archive into the wrong subdir. Is there a way to delete all files and dirs that have been created in say the last 5 minutes
17:25  katoen: if you delete either of them, the one remaining is the "original" if that makes it easier to understand
17:26  knittl: katoen: yes, i only remove the link to the inode
17:26  katoen: knittl: first make a copy, so your data is secure
17:26  katoen: knittl: then remove one of the filenames you wish to remove the hardlink for
17:27  knittl: i think we are not talking about the same things
17:27  knittl: i have two files, pointing to the same inode (two hardlinks)
17:27  katoen: check
17:27  knittl: i now want to turn one hardlink into a copy
17:27  knittl: i want two files, pointing at two different inodes (with the same data though)
17:27  knittl: i want to files to be independent
17:29  knittl: * i want the two files x
17:29  katoen: so, let's say the 2nd hardlink is called 'orig_bak', you would do 'cp orig_bak new_file && rm orig_bak'
17:29  knittl: s/x/…/
17:29  knittl: katoen: what i said with `cp link copy && rm link;`
17:29  knittl: i thought there would be a command to 'break' a hardlink (and in turn create a copy of the data)
17:29  katoen: yes, i missed that bit, apologies.
17:29  knittl: under the same name
17:31  katoen: to my knowledge there's no way to 'convert' a hardlink into a new file. you copy and delete. Like you suggested yourself.
17:31  knittl: ok. thanks a lot
17:31  PingFloyd: just cp the file, then rm the old link
17:32  katoen: the wait is now for someone with greater knowledge to prove us wrong :-)

17:38  Chapoolin: I can't move a symlink to the Trash folder ... what's the problem?
17:38  knittl: permissions?
17:38  Chapoolin: knittl:: i'm root, link is root
17:39  knittl: hm. full filesystem?
17:40  knittl: read-only filesystem?
17:40  knittl: what's the error message?
17:41  Chapoolin: knittl:: hm, "rm -f " deleted it
17:42  Chapoolin: why do some symlinks have name "blah.Desktop"?
17:42  knittl: .Desktop files are usually 'gnome desktop icon links'
17:43  Chapoolin: knittl:: yes, Gnome here
17:43  knittl: those are gnome specific files, they are not symlinks
17:43  knittl: in fact they're files
17:43  knittl: * text files
17:44  Chapoolin: knittl:: but a 3rd party app put it there, "Second Life" specifically.
17:44  knittl: so? that's pretty much the same thing as a windows .lnk file on the desktop
17:45  jelly: they used to be Gnome, now they're freedesktop.org
17:45  Chapoolin: hm, i haven't dribbled Winders for years
17:46  reisio: oh is freedesktop doing the openoffice.org TLD-in-name nonsense, too? :p
17:47  PingFloyd: TLD-in-name?
17:47  jelly: nonsense?  What's in a name?
17:47  reisio: jelly: an enormous chuckle if they ever lose the domain
17:48  PingFloyd: oh
17:48  jelly: reisio: find something worthwhile to complain about, please
17:48  reisio: jelly: k
17:48  reisio: I can see messages from you
17:48  reisio: it hurts
17:48  jelly: /ignore can help
17:48  reisio: jelly: please make it so
17:48  jelly: no u
17:49  reisio: you're the one complaining about my complaining
17:49  reisio: it should really be you who ignores me
17:49  Chapoolin: PingFloyd:: TLD-in-name?
17:49  jelly: my irc client isn't smart enough to filter just the complaints
17:49 * robinetd hugs jelly.
17:49  PingFloyd: he meant using top level domain in the product name
17:49  jelly: reisio: and you still happen to provide content from time to time!
17:50  jelly: robinetd: thanks!
17:50  reisio: jelly: don't spread lies!
17:50  Chapoolin: PingFloyd:: oh.  got it  :)  thanks
17:50  robinetd: jelly: mutually beneficial. I'm using you as a mule.
17:50 * robinetd planted stolen goods on jelly's person.
17:50  PingFloyd: Chapoolin: I didn't know what he meant first either
17:50 * reisio planted stolen jellies on jelly's person
17:51  Chapoolin: PingFloyd:: so many acronyms it's all a blur to me ... lol :D
17:51  jelly: Chapoolin: "lol", eh? :-)
17:51  jelly: I see what you did there
17:52  Chapoolin: jelly:: ell oh ell ... :D
17:54  jelly: hopefully that 2nd Life client also has a make uninstall rule to clean its files out if one ever wants to remove it
17:56  _wired: hey guys, can someone help me out with a regex? i am trying to make a sed regex which replaces ('key_name' '??') with ('key_name' 'replaced-text-here') whereby ?? can be anything or nothing at all (i.e, just '' by itself)
17:56  _wired: i think capturing groups have to be used, right?
17:56  EdwardIII: hey, is there a virtualisation platform that runs on bare metal?
17:56  EdwardIII: something that's FOSS
17:56  _wired: EdwardIII: if you consider the free version of XenServer to be FOSS.... since the source code's floating around
17:57  EdwardIII: heh how about the F bit?
17:57 * EdwardIII looks it up
17:57  jelly: _wired: can your ?? it really be anything, including, say, a ) character?
17:57  _wired: it *is* free.
17:58  _wired: jelly: uh, its usually AZaz09. you know, standard upper/lower case and digits
17:58  _wired: however you type it in regex :P
17:58  jelly: _wired: but say, _not_ an ' or an )
17:58  _wired: but i reckon you'd search for the '
17:58  jelly: presumably
17:58  _wired: as the ending delimiter
17:58  _wired: yea, correct
17:59  jelly: so you can match for 0 or more occurences of "not single-quote" -->  [^']*
18:00  EdwardIII: actually now we have hyper-v is there any point in running a vm host baremetal?
18:01  _wired: when i did regex's in php, i'd do something like \(\'key_name\'\ \'.*?\') and then repeat the same thing for the replace part.. but i think its pretty dirty :P
18:01  _wired: plus i need it done in sed, sooo...
18:04  jelly: _wired: something like sed -r "s/(\\('key_name' ')[^')]*('\\))/\\1replaced-text-here\\2/g" (note unsightly escaping of single \ to \\)
18:04  rethus: if i connect to my server wia ssh, i see german umlauts as broken chars. how can i check, which Charset i have set actually on cmd, and how can i easyly change it on cli ? (debian lenny)
18:04  _wired: EdwardIII: hyper-v isnt exactly compatible with all OS'es
18:05  Chapoolin: jelly:: "rm -rf" got rid of second-life-install dir for me
18:05  Chapoolin: . . . gotta go.  Catch you all later. ...
18:07  boredboy: anybody here good with grub?  have a fresh debian install, but everytime I run update-grub it sets the wrong root entry.  root(hd1,0) instead of root(hd0,0).  /boot/grub/device.map only has one entry
18:07  _wired: jelly: sed -r? you mean -e?
18:08  reisio: boredboy: what makes you think it's wrong
18:08  boredboy: reisio: the system won't boot
18:08  jelly: _wired: no.
18:09  _wired: jelly: nvm i was using wrong sed on my mac :P using the right one on my linux box
18:09  boredboy: reisio: if I edit the line and change it to hd0,0 it is fine
18:09  _wired: the mac's sed was like wayyyy old
18:09  jelly: well, this is ##linux and I assume GNU sed
18:09  mrcarrot: boredboy: this drove me crasy with debian based distros... it is changing from the dpkg configuration database. it is like removing the purpose of having configuration files as they are overwritten by stupid settings from a database
18:10  Giant81: jelly, why so many \'s in your sed? I know you have to escape them, but I didn't see in any in _wired's original question
18:10  Giant81: just curious if I'm missing something
18:10  jelly: Giant81: it was either use "" and escape backslashes, or use the usual '' but have to escape all the single quotes
18:10  mrcarrot: boredboy: do a dpkg-reconfigure on the kernel... and the same on all the grub packages. one of those dpkg-reconfigure solved the problem for me
18:11  boredboy: mrcarrot: cheers.  I'll see if they help
18:15  Giant81: jelly, makes sense, I was looking at "replaces ('key_name' '??') with ('key_name' 'replaced-text-here')" not his second one about doing it in PHP, that must be where I got confused
18:16  internetishard: Hey, I have to write a paper on "interrupts" - Can you guys give me some topics and subtopics that I should try to include, and if possible some sources that talk a lot about them?
18:17  _wired: jelly: if i wanted to write the output back to the file, does sed have a flag for it? (cos "w" flag seems to only reflect the pattern matches).. or is doing it with: sed -r "s/(\\('key_name' ')[^')]*('\\))/\\1replaced-text-here\\2/g" lol.txt > lol.txt sufficient?
18:18  go|dfish: _wired: -i
18:18  go|dfish: _wired: shell redirection is set up before command execution, so blah lol.txt > lol.txt will "empty" lol.txt
18:19 --- hacked_ is now known as hacked
18:19  _wired: thanks go|dfish ! :D
18:19  _wired: ooops
18:19  _wired: i always thought > echoes the final output no matter what it is
18:20  _wired: or do i have to prefix it with &&
18:20  _wired: because && forces sequential running, right?
18:20  _wired: or am i confused :P
18:22  go|dfish: well, with: sed -r 's///' lol.txt > lol.txt, the > lol.txt part happens first, which will empty lol.txt, then the sed -r 's///' part happens, but lol.txt will already be empty
18:26  lautriv_: expirience with linux on Thinkpad T43 ?
18:27 * reisio headdesks
18:29  _wired: ah, thanks go|dfish
18:29 --- denny_ is now known as denny
18:29  _wired: learnt smt new today
18:29  _wired: :D
18:29  Ratrophy: lautriv_, yeah http://www.linux-laptop.net/ibm.html
18:38  Giant81: goldfish, yeah made that error working through my sed labs for my linux class
18:39  Giant81: sed -r 's///' < lol.txt > lol.txt would that work?  would it do < first then > so pull in the file, then empty it and place the results in it?
18:39  kylefox: Anyone know why I might be getting an error like this?  http://d.pr/LU9c  (the `gcc` command IS installed, I verified this)
18:40  Val_0: is there a way to know what command requires elevated privileges and what command doesn't?
18:42  ananke: Val_0: if it's in a directory named 'sbin', likely it requires those extra privileges
18:42  Val_0: thank you :D
18:42  Giant81: Val_0, run it and fine out?
18:43  Val_0: Giant81, it's "shutdown -h", can't really do that...
18:43  Giant81: I guess if it asks, it might also depend not just on if you can use the command but what the command does
18:43  Giant81: hehe, yeah you need to be admin to do that I'm pretty sure
18:44  logicwrath: Anyone ever use a quad opteron 870 tyan thunder server?  I was thinking about getting one.
18:44  Giant81: for example, find can be run as root or not, the difference is just how many folder it can search in
18:44  Giant81: logicwrath, build my own dual opteron tyan server at home
18:44  Val_0: i see... I am creating some documentation on powering down servers, and one of them is a linux box... so sudo is a must in this case
18:45  Giant81: dual 2.3Ghz quads, 16GB ECC, 4x 500gb SATA drives for storage, and 2x 250gb for OS
18:45  logicwrath: giant: i can get quad dc 2.0 opteron 870's with 16 GB memory for < $200
18:45  Giant81: Val_0, I suspect yes, unless you are logged into the machine as someone with elevated permissions already
18:45  logicwrath: but im not familiar with the tyan thunder chipsets
18:45  logicwrath: i also cant find any benchmarks
18:46  Val_0: thanks Giant81
18:46  Giant81: logicwrath, that I don't know, I built my whole server for about $600, paid $200 for the board alone and $75/each for the opterons
18:46  Zenth: Hey guys
18:46  logicwrath: giant: what board?
18:46  Giant81: everything was ued off ebay
18:47  Giant81: let me look
18:47  Zenth: How do I mount /dev/sda to install grub from a liveCD?
18:47 * mrcarrot is guessing Zenth is using ubuntu...
18:47  Fieldy: you don't need it mounted to install grub
18:48  Zenth: mrcarrot: not really, I use Fedora or openSUse
18:48  mrcarrot: cd /mnt
18:48  mrcarrot: mount -o bind /dev dev
18:48  Zenth: Fieldy: ok, thanks, I thought I did
18:48  mrcarrot: uh.. mistake
18:48  mrcarrot: mkdir dev
18:48  mrcarrot: mkdir sys
18:48  mrcarrot: mkdir proc
18:48  mrcarrot: mount -o bind /proc proc
18:48  mrcarrot: do the same for all those other folders
18:49  mrcarrot: i am tired.. you actually do not need to create those folders... just "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" first
18:49  mrcarrot: then chroot /mnt
18:51  extor: 5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   017   017   036    Pre-fail  Always   FAILING_NOW 3436

18:52  Giant81: logicwrath, http://www.tyan.com/product_SKU_spec.aspx?ProductType=MB&pid=541&SKU=600000041  <-- pretty sure that's my board
18:52  Giant81: though I did get the RAM for free
18:53  Giant81: I have the one without the SAS :( but hey for $200 for a dual socket tyan, I wasn't going to compain
18:53  karthick87: I have installed Drupal 6 using synaptic and it shows as installed in synaptic but NOT in my Ubuntu software center but it is nowhere to be found. Can anyone help?
18:53  logicwrath: giant: http://www.tyan.com/archive/products/html/thunderk8qspro.html <- i am looking at this one
18:56  Mkman: Hey!
18:58  logicwrath: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=350416119937#ht_2454wt_1139 - 3 min left if anyone wants it! go go
18:58  logicwrath: im going to pass
18:58  karthick87: how to reinstall removed repositories?
19:00  axle3d: i understand that hfsprogs is integrated into the latest linux kernels, but what about hfsutils? from its site it looks really outdated (last release 1998) or is there another defacto hfs utility?
19:00  cache_surplus: can someone help me with trbshting frames in ifconfig that are two high? what is the next step....
19:01  elb0w: Anyone know if logmein plans to support linux ever?
19:02  mAniAk-_-: no
19:03  elb0w: :( the pitfalls of linux
19:03  GNU\colossus: elb0w, so build your own?
19:04  GNU\colossus: it's trivially easy to do that, really.
19:04  elb0w: its not about recreating something
19:04  elb0w: its about standards
19:04  elb0w: its like metric vs units
19:04  scp1: elb0w, looks like... uh... openssh?
19:04  elb0w: yeah you can make tools for both, but its a pain
19:05  elb0w: what does ssh have to do with logmein?
19:05  scp1: Well, I assumed you talked about what first popped up on google.
19:05  elb0w: you know what happens when you assume right?
19:06  elb0w: nvm teamviewr looks like it does it all
19:06  Rickardo1: How do I set the compressionlevel with tar?
19:06  elb0w: and for the low cost of $719
19:06  elb0w: horray
19:09  kido: hi
19:10  krabador: hi people, i would to know if the newest wiimote, the wiimote plus, is working with cwiid/wiican too
