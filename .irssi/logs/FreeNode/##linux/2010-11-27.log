00:10  mastertheknife: it works?
00:11  KingGurke: nope
00:11  KingGurke: trying once more, hang on
00:11  mastertheknife: try using the default end sector that fdisk gives you (last sector)
00:11  KingGurke: ok
00:12  KingGurke: oh, i think i forgot to write
00:12  KingGurke: maybe
00:12  KingGurke: no, let me try defaults now
00:12 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 132 seconds
00:13  KingGurke: mastertheknife: should i worry about dos compatible mode?
00:13  KingGurke: yeah, no dice
00:14  mastertheknife: no, dos compatibility mode of fdisk tries to make new partitions on cylinder boundary, but this doesnt matter, hard drives use LBA addressing nowdays and not CHS
00:14  KingGurke: ok
00:14  mastertheknife: what error do you get? invalid partition ?
00:14  KingGurke: EXT3-fs (sdb1): error: can't find ext3 filesystem on dev sdb1.
00:15  mastertheknife: i give up
00:15  KingGurke: haha
00:15  KingGurke: well, thanks for your help
00:15  KingGurke: it was a valiant effort
00:15  mastertheknife: maybe there is a tool to convert bsdlabel to standard mbr, or maybe try to add bsdlabel support to your system like GNU\colusus said
00:15  KingGurke: well
00:16  mastertheknife: after your changes did you verify that fdisk -u -l shows start sector 63?
00:16  GNU\colossus: dude, just compile the kernel with BSD disklabel support, and you're done
00:16  KingGurke: zcat /proc/config.gz | grep BSD_DISKLABEL
00:16  KingGurke: CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL=y
00:16  GNU\colossus: there really is no need to fubar everything on that disk
00:16  KingGurke: /proc/config.gz is my kernel config, right?
00:16  GNU\colossus: yup.
00:16  KingGurke: it tells me BSD_DISKLABEL's compiled in
00:16  GNU\colossus: can the other Linux kernel you installed still read the volume?
00:16  KingGurke: yes
00:16  KingGurke: i keep rebooting back and forth
00:16  KingGurke: fedora has no problem
00:17  KingGurke: gentoo has the problem with it
00:18  GNU\colossus: KingGurke, grep for CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED
00:18  GNU\colossus: any results?
00:18  KingGurke: zcat /proc/config.gz | grep CONFIG_PARTITION
00:18  KingGurke: CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED=y
00:18  GNU\colossus: hm ok
00:19  GNU\colossus: I don't think there are any other requirements to properly support that kind of part. scheme
00:19  KingGurke: gdisk also tells me it's a bsd partition table
00:19  KingGurke: heh
00:19  GNU\colossus: so I can't put my finger on what's wrong.
00:19  mastertheknife: :S
00:20  GNU\colossus: KingGurke, have you considered booting your gentoo install with the fedora kernel? ;)
00:20  KingGurke: GNU\colossus: hmm
00:20  KingGurke: that's a possibility
00:20  KingGurke: let me see how i'm booting fedora right now
00:21  GNU\colossus: just the kernel image and initrd of course, you'd probably have to adapt your bootloader's config for that to work properly
00:21  mastertheknife: or finding a tool that converts bsd disk label to mbr
00:21  GNU\colossus: just make sure that you identify your gentoo / filesystem to the kernel image. gentoo doesn't need more than that to boot in general, as calling /sbin/init is done automatically anyways
00:22  KingGurke: yeah
00:22  GNU\colossus: if that works, and your partitions/filesystems are found, then the problem has to be your gentoo kernel
00:22  GNU\colossus: if not, then some userspace component might be at fault
00:23  KingGurke: hmm, ok
00:23  GNU\colossus: (although I seriously doubt that)
00:24  KingGurke: ok, rebooting
00:24  mastertheknife: Its kind of weird that running fdisk -u -l in fedora reports invalid partition table.. fdisk has no bsd disklabel support?
00:24  gordboy: GNU\colossus: i used to do that very thing. fedora make (or at least made) half-decent ready-rolled kernels
00:25  GNU\colossus: mastertheknife, that's probably the case
00:25  gordboy: "fedora. we take the pain out of gentoo"
00:26  GNU\colossus: ;P
00:26  GNU\colossus: I switched from Gentoo to Fedora - though I'm not as happy as I had hoped to be, actually.
00:26  mastertheknife: KingGurke: if i may ask.. how did you end up with bsd disk label instead of MBR? did fedora do it?
00:27  mastertheknife: I love gentoo and probably  wont switch anytime soon
00:27  GNU\colossus: (actually, my Gentoo installation was darn fine. I just got a new harddrive (SSD, actually) and succumbed to trying something new)
00:27 --- Muzer is now known as MuzerAway
00:27  GNU\colossus: mastertheknife, fedora creates plain old MBR MSDOS partitions
00:27  gordboy: nesting error at line 1
00:27  GNU\colossus: it even aligns the starting sectors in a way that doesn't harm SSDs and 4k sector sized drives :)
00:28  cocoloa: dwhite: hey, running "aptitude install tex-common" twice unblocked apt-get (though a lot of texlive packages are gone now, but i don't need them atm, though i will surely need some of them in the future, but i feel free to delay the problem for now), so thx for your help! was a great idea to use aptitude again!
00:28  gordboy: i put an ext2 on an 8G ssd. seems they die off quicker with journalling
00:28  dwhite: good deal
00:29  GNU\colossus: gordboy, that's probably true.
00:29  lautriv: gordboy, sure, limited write count, noatime is also a help.
00:29  GNU\colossus: gordboy, I'd still prefer ext4 without a journal
00:29  GNU\colossus: that way, you don't lose discard support
00:29  GNU\colossus: which is way more important than anything else, probably
00:30  gordboy: GNU\colossus: lautriv: yeah noatime, ext2 and elevator=noop
00:30  GNU\colossus: mkfs.ext4 -O ^has_journal ... <device>
00:31  gordboy: just packing in the ram, and forgetting about swap is an idea too
00:31  gordboy: yeah i did that very thing, to convert from ext3
00:31  GNU\colossus: then you haven't got an actual ext2 fs though. yours still support extents, for example.
00:33  gordboy: someone actually suggested putting doze 7 on it. hmmm. wouldn't fit, uses journalling, too slow. apart from that ...
00:34  GNU\colossus: btw, does xfs support discard yet?
00:34  RenatoSilva: how to get IP without parsing ifconfig output? something like $ip ppp0
00:35  GNU\colossus: RenatoSilva, for IPv4 only, check out http://johannes.truschnigg.info/code/ipof.pl.asc
00:35  Seven_Six_Two: when I am installing another linux beside ubuntu(sda1  /) do I put the boot loader on new linux (sda4 /) and modify ubuntu loader, or tell second linux to install boot loader on sda1?
00:35  GNU\colossus: (feel free to redistribute under GPLv3 or later ;p)
00:36  [R]: Seven_Six_Two: you can put the boot loader on the partition, and than ubuntu's grub will find it
00:37  Seven_Six_Two: [R], do I have to do anything to ubuntu's grub? I'm assuming by "partition" that you mean sda4, the new install's /
00:37  RenatoSilva: GNU\colossus: how to use it
00:37  [R]: Seven_Six_Two: update-grub will find it when its run
00:37  RenatoSilva: GNU\colossus: just calling doesn't show IP
00:38  GNU\colossus: [colo@zealot ~]$ ipof google.com
00:38  GNU\colossus: 66.102.13.103
00:38  gordboy: Seven_Six_Two: beware that you keep the two grubs in sync. if you change kernels or anything it can get a bit tiresome. or have one distro control the boot, but have to switch to it to update grub. nasty either way
00:38  GNU\colossus: my box begs to differ
00:38  RenatoSilva: GNU\colossus:  how to get IP without parsing ifconfig output? something like $ip ppp0
00:38  GNU\colossus: ah. lol. my bad.
00:39  Gorroth: anyone have a working 802.11g or (preferably) 802.11n USB device that can run in Master mode?
00:40  Gorroth: i have a TP-Link TL-WN821N (atherose ar9170usb based) card, but i can't get it in master mode :-/
00:40  metalfoo: That may mostly depend on the chipset, not that much on the bus
00:40  gordboy: Gorroth: one option to use ndiswrapper with xp driver. ugly but often works
00:41  Gorroth: metalfoo: yes, that's why i chose atheros, but this one doesn't work
00:41  metalfoo: gordboy: You especially won't get into master mode by using ndiswrapper
00:41  Gorroth: gordboy: yeah.  now, how do i use ndis in place of the linux kernel module?
00:42  Gorroth: maybe i can get a freebsd live cd working and can maybe test it from ther
00:42  Gorroth: there*
00:42  metalfoo: Gorroth: ndiswrapper is unable to put device into master mode, regardless which.
00:42  metalfoo: http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/WLAN See here for a nice overview about chipsets and master mode capabilities.
00:43  sedulous: RenatoSilva: "ip -4 addr" is the correct way to get the IPs
00:43  sedulous: (ifconfig only shows 1 address, not all assigned ones)
00:44  sedulous: RenatoSilva: ip -4 addr show dev ppp0
00:44  metalfoo: or "ip addr list" simply as that
00:44  RenatoSilva: sedulous: ip -4 addr needs to be parsed the same way
00:44  crocket: hi
00:44  RenatoSilva: sedulous: also what you mean one address
00:44  GNU\colossus: good night all
00:44  RenatoSilva: sedulous: and why that
00:44  crocket: The miniITX server computer I almost completed is heavier than I thought. It is made of aluminum.
00:44  sedulous: RenatoSilva: you can assign plenty addresses to a single interface
00:45  RenatoSilva: sedulous: why ifconfig won't display them all
00:45  sedulous: i don't know
00:45  sedulous: but it doesn't
00:45  gordboy: metalfoo: yes you are right. i just saw "tp-link" and ignored "master mode"
00:45  RenatoSilva: sedulous: I don't care anyway, I don't use more than one IP on my DSL connection
00:46  metalfoo: Because it is not the supposed to assign more than one interface that way. The correct way would be to create a subinterface, nonetheless you can add it by using raw level tools like ip too.
00:46  RenatoSilva: sedulous: anyway, ip -4 addr is still useless, parsing needed. I thought there is something like $ip interface=ppp0 number=1
00:47  RenatoSilva: sedulous: I just don't know how exactly
00:48  sedulous: RenatoSilva: i don't know a shorter way
00:48  RenatoSilva: sedulous: it's weird there's no way to print info for a named interface
00:49  RenatoSilva: sedulous: like ifconfig ppp0
00:51  sedulous: RenatoSilva: well there's "ip -4 addr show dev ppp0" but as you said, still 2 lines
00:51  lautriv: RenatoSilva, if i see that right, you will just see your external IP from dialin ?
00:52  RenatoSilva: sedulous: ip address show ppp0, but still needs parsing
00:52  RenatoSilva: lautriv: ?
00:53 --- MuzerAway is now known as Muzer
00:54  sedulous: RenatoSilva: is parsing so bad?
00:55  RenatoSilva: sedulous: no, it's amazing: alias pppip='ifconfig | grep -A 1 ppp | grep inet | sed -r "s/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/" | grep -v inet || echo unknown'
00:56  lautriv: RenatoSilva, curl tnx.nl/ip;echo
00:57  sedulous: RenatoSilva: ip addr show dev ppp0 |sed -rn 's/^\s+inet ([^ ]+).*/\1/p'
00:57  RenatoSilva: lautriv: need to install curl, what's curl and tnx.nl/ip exactly
00:58  lautriv: RenatoSilva, external feedback
00:59  RenatoSilva: lautriv: ?
00:59  RenatoSilva: sedulous: thanks but can't grok that line
00:59  lautriv: RenatoSilva, give it a try, not bad to have curl anyway.
01:00  RenatoSilva: sedulous: sed -rn is multiline, then replace space from beginning of string one or more times with inet then something which is not space (this time as literal) then anything with the group??? and /p ???
01:01  RenatoSilva: lautriv: even though it's shorter, it's more enigmatic to me and requires installing a new software for just printing an ip
01:01  KingGurke: e2fsck takes longer based on the total used size of a partition, not its total size, right?
01:01  RenatoSilva: lautriv: but thanks
01:02  sedulous: RenatoSilva: -r: extended regex, -n: quiet   /p: print only the match
01:02  metalfoo: No way to use curl though.
01:02  metalfoo: -way +need
01:02  metalfoo: echo "GET /ip HTTP/1.0\nHost:tnx.nl\n\n" | nc tnx.nl http
01:02  metalfoo:  works do, if you want to do it the hard way
01:02  metalfoo: -do +to
01:02  RenatoSilva: sedulous: why quiet? what should not say?
01:03  sedulous: RenatoSilva: searches for a line that matches: space followed by inet, (the word behind that), replaces everything with the (group) \1 and prints it
01:03  RenatoSilva: sedulous: without /p only the match is printed too
01:03  sedulous: RenatoSilva: no it isn't
01:03  RenatoSilva: sedulous: but it's working here????
01:03  sedulous: without /p the output is empty
01:04  sedulous: paste your exact line
01:04  RenatoSilva: sedulous: I pasted the exact line?
01:04  RenatoSilva: (21:55:22) RenatoSilva: sedulous: no, it's amazing: alias pppip='ifconfig | grep -A 1 ppp | grep inet | sed -r "s/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/" | grep -v inet || echo unknown'
01:04  sedulous: RenatoSilva: i'm curious how it is working for you
01:04  RenatoSilva: sedulous: try it and see
01:04  sedulous: ok, i thought you were using mine
01:05  sedulous: nevermind then
01:05  RenatoSilva: sedulous: it scans ifconfig for ppp IP, then return it. If not found, return 'unknown'
01:08  sedulous: RenatoSilva: i know
01:10  metalfoo: That command is amazingly bad.
01:11  metalfoo: Today's candidate for useless use of pipe award
01:11  RenatoSilva: sedulous: http://ideone.com/hnkDz
01:11  infinitux: how do I kill a process only if it's running by testing, and do nothing in the case that it is not?
01:11  lautriv: metalfoo, and grep but it's his machine :-)
01:12  RenatoSilva: metalfoo: incorrect
01:12  usman: hello everyone, I have some strange problem with doxygen. I configure the Doxyfile from the link http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-learningdoxygen/ and then run the doxygen, it generate the html site but its looks very simple and also no digarams in it.
01:12  usman: i have a 2 .c files and a header file
01:12  metalfoo: sedulous suggestion is much better, but as lautriv said: Its your machine.
01:12  infinitux: what would be the syntax of the bash command?
01:12  RenatoSilva: metalfoo: no it's not better
01:13  usman: doxygen Doxyfile
01:13  RenatoSilva: metalfoo: you don't understand what I want and what are the exact differences between the two versions
01:13  dwhite: lautriv, are you trying to kill a process by PID, or name? why do you want to do a test first?
01:14  metalfoo: infinisoft: test && kill, e.g. use grep to find your process on the process list and kill it if that command succeeds by using the && operator
01:14  lautriv: dwhite, i won't et all :P
01:14  dwhite: yeah, typo sorry
01:15  RenatoSilva: sedulous: that's the best I could get for clean output
01:15  ifdef42: my brain finally found "tail -f" in its archives, so now i don't have to ask the embarrassing question i came here for. whew!
01:16  RenatoSilva: sedulous: $pppip; pppdown; pppdown; pppup; pppup; ppprestart (test case)
01:17  RenatoSilva: sedulous: actually I can avoid one pipe replacing "ifconfig | grep -A 1 ppp0" with "ifconfig ppp0 2>&1"
01:18  usman: yes guys anyone know about the doxygen documentation
01:23  lautriv: RenatoSilva, you can avoid all grep
01:25  RenatoSilva: lautriv: I can fly too
01:25 * Psi-Jack puts a jetpack on RenatoSilva.
01:25  lautriv: RenatoSilva, and you can fail
01:25 * RenatoSilva here we go
01:28  lautriv: n8 dudes
01:29  RenatoSilva: sedulous: ifconfig ppp0 |sed -rn 's/^.*anet end.: (\S+).*/\1/p'
01:30  RenatoSilva: sedulous: problem is that if none, then I want unknown, the only way I'm thinking of is something after that  like | grep ^. || echo unknown
01:30  RenatoSilva: sedulous: s/anet/inet
01:42  RenatoSilva: am I connected?
01:46  Gorroth: anyone here know of anything like a mifi but without 3g?  i.e. a battery-powered access point that can be plugged into, say, a computer as the uplink, and that computer can do the routing to something like a 3g modem or something
01:47  paul424: why blkid does not compute the /dev/sda ? while /dev/sda3 is ok ?
01:48  paul424: why blkid does not compute the /dev/sda ? while /dev/sda3 is ok ?
01:52  Lijnk: /dev/sda is the entire drive located at sda, so it won't have a partition attached to it
01:53  Lijnk: it won't be a partition in itself I mean. It is split up into partitions like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc.

16:55  industrial: I installed some packages (zeromq, mongrel2) from source into /usr/local with no additional configure/make path options. I do not know which files on my disk are where and from which packages. I concerely feel that I have no control over the files and I want to remove them but I don't know which files. How do I find out?
16:55  industrial: This is why I cling to package managers usually. I hate having files 'loose' on my disk :(
16:56  industrial: but then every piece of software advises you to build from source and not to use the package manager as they are usually out of date ..
16:56  industrial: cincerely*
16:56  gordboy: industrial: you don't find out, except by carefully reading thru all the makefiles. if you are lucky, some of them will have uninstall targets for "make"
16:57  industrial: gordboy: so other people just leave the files there forever? they dont care?
16:57  GNU\colossus: that's also why you use checkinstall to do such stuff
16:57  gordboy: industrial: every piece of software does *not* advise you anything of the sort. just use your package manager, unless you have a VERY good reason
16:58  industrial: gordboy: specific make options, latest versions, bugfixes
16:58  gordboy: bollocks
16:58  industrial: I've run into many many many problems with outdated package manager versions
16:58  industrial: and usually I install stuff to ~/Applications/<appname>
16:58  gordboy: i'm sure you're a real expert
16:58  industrial: but then I have to juggle with paths
16:59  industrial: but then at least its easily removable
16:59  gordboy: listen industrial, you seem to know sod all about package management. i've given you what i consider to be good advice, if you are not interested, fine
16:59  robinetd: gordboy: You made him cry! :(
17:00  gordboy: osx idiot has left the building
17:00  industrial: ubuntu and archlinux
17:00  industrial: btw
17:00  robinetd: industrial: archlinux has ABS and pacman, ubuntu has apt.
17:01  industrial: gordboy: and I came in here asking for how make installs usually work and if they can be uninstalled easily again, not to be directed to 'use the package manager luke'.
17:01  robinetd: Read the makefile then.
17:01  industrial: i did, no make uninstall.
17:01  robinetd: Okay then. What's your question?
17:01  robinetd: Kid has problems. :o
17:06  chomwitt: is rt2x00.serialmonkey.com closed or sth ?
17:07  robinetd: chomwitt: Is that what I think it is?
17:08  gordboy: it's a driver for ralink wifi
17:08  chomwitt: robinetd: is a site of a gpl driver for wifi chipset
17:08  gordboy: looks like the site is down tho
17:09  robinetd: Interesting. I figured it'd be an unsavory place, given the domain name. Sorry for jumping the gun :>
17:10  SkunkyFone: there are in-kernel drivers for ralink, both staging and experimental
17:11  sedulous: robinetd: maybe it's related to ralink's recent open source efforts and it became redundant?
17:11  chomwitt: i experienced severy regression in my wifi connection after upgrading to ubuntu 10.04 in my brothers pc.
17:11  sedulous: (idk, i only have intel & realtek wifi adapters)
17:12  gordboy: chomwitt: i take it he has ralink rt2x00 chipset. you could always try ndiswrapper
17:13  chomwitt: gordboy: yes RT2561
17:17  bobng: I need some help with taring some directories. How can I tar all files and folders in a directory, with some exclusions?
17:17  bobng: I want to tar up /var/www/trunk, excluding /var/www/trunk/assets
17:19  gordboy: chomwitt: if you want to try ndiswrapper route, install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils-1.9, then get hold of windows xp driver for chipset (from ralink site)
17:21  gordboy: chomwitt: you also have to unload and blacklist kernel rt driver (use lsmod to get the name), and add ndiswrapper to /etc/modules
17:23  gordboy: mileage varies with ndiswrapper but it often does the trick

17:30  IVIarcell: hey guys, I was hoping for some help. I am looking for a joystick that is supported by linux (e.g. ubuntu)
17:32  IVIarcell: couldn't find any concrete information so far
17:32  reisio: IVIarcell: look for one that isn't
17:33  cheater00: i have a logitech gamepad (clone of playstation gamepad) and it works well, no special drivers.
17:33  cheater00: it's called "logitech dual action"
17:34  IVIarcell: ok, so there might be a good chance that any one would work?
17:34  ^Rehan: any one tell me how to add friends in chatzilla ?
17:34  cheater00: no idea
17:34  cheater00: but probably
17:34  sedulous: most USB joysticks and gamepads just work unless they're special in a way
17:34  cheater00: i think all HID joysticks (meaning, all joysticks) will be supported by linux.
17:34  sedulous: i got some cheap-o dual analog gamepads and they just work
17:34  sedulous: yeah, what cheater00 says
17:34  Blockcold: hello which is bootable file in linux ?
17:35  IVIarcell: how do I calibrate them? I found something about "jscalibrator".
17:35  sedulous: IVIarcell: the chance that a random USB joystick won't work is rather small
17:35  sedulous: you don't need to calibrate modern joysticks anymore
17:35  MrElendig: Blockcold: ?
17:36  IVIarcell: are you sure? I had to calibrate my gamepad with windos
17:37  reisio: http://www.chproducts.com/ best joysticks
17:37  IVIarcell: cool
17:37  reisio: wish they still made the older model

17:38  cheater00: i'm very fond of logi joysticks myself
17:38  cheater00: had a few now
17:38  Blockcold: MrElendig: i wnat to no bootable file in linux ?
17:38  PingFloyd: besides, dealing with the files installed is only a tip of the iceburg of the mess.  Then there is the dependencies.
17:38  reisio: pish!
17:38  MrElendig: Blockcold: ?
17:38  reisio: cheater00: and what other brand joysticks have you ever used?
17:38  MrElendig: Blockcold: you are not making any sense
17:38  cheater00: none.
17:39  reisio: cheater00: big surprise :p
17:39  MrElendig: Blockcold: what exactly is the problem?
17:39  Blockcold: ohhh this is in my interview question
17:39  cheater00: yeah, reisio trolling again is no surprise.
17:39  reisio: by far one of the more interesting reasons to call someone a troll :p
17:39  PingFloyd: some people never learn that there is a reason for why developers went to great lengths to devise packaging systems.
17:39  sedulous: make install, not war
17:39  Blockcold: ok grub is a bootable file ?
17:40  Blockcold: or vmlinuz ?
17:40  IVIarcell: hmm, CH joysticks are not cheap
17:40  reisio: Blockcold: what's the question?
17:40  reisio: IVIarcell: how much?
17:40 --- lautriv|eat is now known as lautriv
17:40  lautriv: heyda :-)
17:40  IVIarcell: $122.95
17:40  reisio: flightstick pro is probably the cheapest
17:40  IVIarcell: yes, it's $74.95
17:40  reisio: I'd get one of the older models like the one I linked, though :)
17:40  Blockcold: ahhhh i am going mad the question is which is bootable file in Linux a interviwer ask me :(
17:41  reisio: Blockcold: "which is bootable file in Linux?" ?
17:41  MrElendig: Blockcold: there is no "bootable file"
17:41  Blockcold: :O
17:41  IVIarcell: I would say it's the kernel...
17:41  MrElendig: Blockcold: during boot, the bootloader loads the kernel binary and then executes it
17:41  reisio: pretty odd way to phrase it, though
17:42  reisio: and truly a useless question
17:42  PingFloyd: it's a bad question
17:42  MrElendig: but the kernel binary is not something special, it's just another binary file
17:42  PingFloyd: obviously written by someone that thinks they have an answer, but they're really just as lost
17:42  Blockcold: reisio: yes my mind get stucked :( stupid interviewer XD
17:43  reisio: you should've made fun of them
17:43  lautriv: Blockcold, interview for an admin job ?
17:43  PingFloyd: a better question would be, "What is the boot process of the average distro"
17:43 --- GentooGeoff is now known as zoite
17:43  Blockcold: lautriv: for desktop engineer job :(
17:43  IVIarcell: are there other stores where one can buy joysticks? don't mention amazon please
17:43  reisio: PingFloyd: it's hard to imagine that knowledge being particularly telling, either
17:43  PingFloyd: I hate test questions where you have to put  a wrong answer to pass
17:44  reisio: unless the job were for a bootloader developer...
17:44  reisio: PingFloyd: the worst
17:44  lautriv: even the, nobody mentioned explicit x86
17:44  lautriv: s/the/then
17:45  PingFloyd: reisio: yeah, it is kind of a pointless question to begin with
17:45  gordboy: IVIarcell: i bought a cheap genius joystick, works fine both lin & win
17:45  reisio: "How do you spell 'Mandriva'?"
17:45  Stava: gordboy, are you there? :o i got the network connection working, by doing ifup eth0 192.168.1.103, however it still doesnt connect to the network automatically on boot. Do you know how i can automate this?
17:45  reisio: "so sorry, you're not qualified for this position!"
17:45  PingFloyd: exactly
17:46  PingFloyd: or asking, "Who invented the linux OS?"
17:46  reisio: heh
17:46 --- speekix is now known as speekix_dinner
17:46  gordboy: Stava: sounds like the router is set for static internal lan ip. you can either change it to do dhcp, or give a /etc/network/interfaces with static info in it
17:47  reisio: or what nationality the inventor/s are
17:47  PingFloyd: what if I put GNU for the answer?
17:47  PingFloyd: it would at least be less incorrect than what they probably have as the "right answer".
17:48  reisio: and less of a total waste of time than regurgitating decades of history
17:48  Stava: gordboy, yeah actually the router is setup that way. Would this be correct configuration? http://pastie.org/1328224
17:49  gordboy: Stava: my static interfaces file (edit to taste) - http://paste.linuxassist.net/215494
17:49  Stava: gordboy, great, thanks!
17:50  gordboy: Stava: the lines to change are the address & gateway
17:51  Stava: yeah
17:51  extor: Is it a hell of a lot easier to install centos over iSCSI than over nfs when you have a diskless station?
17:52  extor: cuz knoppix can sort of act like a thin client over nfs...it doesn't bother with iSCSI
17:53  Stava: gordboy, Still doesnt connect on reboot :(
17:54  gordboy: Stava: what gateway did you give ?
17:54  gordboy: Stava: and did you actually edit /etc/network/interfaces and not a copy ...
17:54  Stava: i did not modify it, since the computers ip address is 192.168.1.103, the gateway should be 192.168.1.1?
17:55  PingFloyd: Stava: usually
17:55  gordboy: it could be anything, actually 192.168.1.254 is common too
17:55  Stava: well i access the routers web interface on 192.168.1.1, so i guess its safe to assume its that? :o
17:55  PingFloyd: but you really need to check
17:56  PingFloyd: yeah, then it is even more likely
17:56  IVIarcell: ok guys, thanks for your help!
17:57  Blockcold: what is fault-tolerance in RAID ?
17:57  reisio: Blockcold: wtf was this job even for? :p
17:57  PingFloyd: Stava: or just use dhcp
17:57  ronghail: what can I tunnel through an ssh tunnel so that I get another interface I can route to?
17:58  IVIarcell: Blockcold: the amount of disks that can fail without losing any data
17:58  Blockcold: reisio: he ask me these questions :( sorry don't think i am trolling :(
17:58  Blockcold: so RAID0 is better than RAID5 ?
17:58  ikonia: Blockcold: you are a Redhat RHCE - or so you say
17:58  ikonia: this should be easy
17:59  PingFloyd: no
17:59  PingFloyd: raid0 is the worst fault tolerance
17:59  reisio: Blockcold: you're not trolling, I just think you're probably wasting your time
17:59  ikonia: PingFloyd: this guys is a known troll
17:59  ikonia: he claims his a RedHat RHCE
17:59  ikonia: yet he's asking this level of question
17:59  PingFloyd: raid0 has less fault tolerance than no raid at all
18:00  edman007: ronghail, ssh -L/-R lets you tunnel ports through, and -D puts a socks server up on the remote end and gives you the port to it on the local end...if you really need an interface then VPN without ssh is probably a better choice (unless you can't get VPN, in which case I think you can just put a tun device on an ssh forward)
18:00  Blockcold: :O i am not trolling here ok i leave this channel i ahve lots of work
18:00  edman007: Blockcold, define "better"
18:00  ikonia: I bet you are busy as a RHCE
18:00  edman007: RAID0 doesn't satisfy the definition of raid
18:00  PingFloyd: ikonia: or proof that certifications really are worthless from a knowledge standpoint
18:01  ronghail: the vpn I can use sucks.  I want to make my own
18:01  ikonia: PingFloyd: the RHCE is a valuable exam, the practical test alone would mean you know this level of stuff
18:01  ronghail: I need to do windows stuff so fowarding individual ports is a pain
18:01  Blockcold: ikonia: yes i am RHCE but no knowledge :(
18:01  ^Rehan: please any one tell me best book or traning link of RHCE
18:01  ikonia: Blockcold: you are a liar
18:02  ikonia: ^Rehan: books are bad for the RHCE due to the practical test which pulls on experience
18:02  PingFloyd: ikonia: I wouldn't know about RHCE, but that is kind of the problem with exams in general
18:02  ^Rehan: Blockcold: are you certified RHCE
18:02  edman007: ronghail, what do you want to do with it, tsocks/ssh -D is in general just so much easier than setting up a real VPN or anything like it over ssh, but does about 90% of what you want
18:02  Stava: gordboy, PingFloyd: I need to do ifdown eth0 and ifup eth0 192.168.1.103 to get online, this is my interfaces file as well as ifconfig output http://pastie.org/1328244
18:02  PingFloyd: ikonia: more focus on memorization than understanding
18:02  Blockcold: ^Rehan: yes ..
18:02  ronghail: windows shares, perforce, rdp
18:02  ikonia: PingFloyd: not the RHCE
18:02  ikonia: ^Rehan: he's not
18:03  ^Rehan: Blockcold: but How's is pass rhce exam /
18:03  edman007: ronghail, tsocks will load some libs into any app you want and make it use a socks server, and ssh will give you a socks server, so that combo will basically proxy anything you want over ssh (not the same as just tunneling, but almost as good)
18:03  Blockcold: ^Rehan: its in my server server1.example.com/papper.htm
18:03  ^Rehan: ikonia: i igree your Answer but 1st must knowledge
18:04  Blockcold: i have pass that examination with that papper
18:04  ^Rehan: Blockcold: its not a live server ?
18:04  edman007: ronghail, most of that should be doable with tsocks and ssh, i recommend you just try that, I don't know about the windows shares (because if you are mounting them at the kernel level it won't work, the kernel needs an interface to route the traffic to)
18:04 * lautriv facepalms
18:05  Blockcold: first question is my password is not define change password via shell :P
18:05  ^Rehan: Blockcold: oh very bad idea but i know RHCE in hole world best certification but you can get ................. why Blockcold
18:05  ikonia: Blockcold: RHCE has a practical exam
18:06  ikonia: Blockcold: you are telling lies
18:06  Blockcold: ^Rehan: its so easy if you have similar question which match the pattern of the exam
18:06  ronghail: edman007:  thanks for your help
18:06  ikonia: you are not an RHCE and the level of questions are not "how do you reset a password"
18:06  ^Rehan: Blockcold: no no i'm not igree your answar
18:07  Blockcold: the pattern is same in whole exam
18:07  ikonia: it's not
18:07  ikonia: it's a practical exam
18:07  Blockcold: wait i'll prove you
18:07  ikonia: the fact that he is saying this is lies
18:07  ^Rehan: Blockcold: your are not RHCE certificate if rhce Certificate can you send me your ID NUm /
18:07  lautriv: ^Rehan, ikonia just stop feeding the troll.
18:07  ronghail: is ikonia a LFS dev?  that name sounds familiar
18:07  ikonia: ronghail: yes, I am
18:08  ronghail: cool
18:08  ikonia: lautriv: not happy with him miss-leading someone
18:08  ^Rehan: ikonia: ok whats your actives ?
18:08  ikonia: ^Rehan: my what ?
18:08  ^Rehan: ikonia: sorry for my bad English
18:09  ikonia: no problem
18:09  ^Rehan: in daily life !
18:09  ^Rehan: and about Linux knowledge ?
18:09  ikonia: I work with Linux
18:09  ^Rehan: in which O/S
18:09  lautriv: ikonia, i know and disagree such behaviour but such ppl stoping faster if they get no further attraction.
18:09  ikonia: I use most of the common ones
18:10  ikonia: lautriv: it's a fair point
18:10  ^Rehan: ikonia: cool

18:16  ikonia: Blockcold: what test centre did you take the exam at
18:16  reisio: I'd agree its at least worth being able to pass
18:17  PingFloyd: that sounds likes rather practical testing
18:17  Blockcold: reisio: nope
18:17  ikonia: PingFloyd: it is, it's a practical test, quite tough
18:17  ^Rehan: i my knowledge i have search best book of rhce in this http://www.amazon.com/Certified-Technician-Engineer-Administrators-Reference/dp/1615844309#reader_1615844309
18:17  ikonia: the senario driven stuff ranges quite a lot
18:17  reisio: Blockcold: you can't invalidate my opinion, that'd be unpossible :p
18:17  PingFloyd: ikonia: not so bad if you know what to expect before hand
18:18  PingFloyd: ikonia: then you know to do the scenarios a few times first
18:18  ^Rehan: any one intersing in RHCE please red the above book
18:18  ikonia: PingFloyd: yes, as long as you know your stuff in general its straight forward (still taxing at times)

18:20  PingFloyd: ikonia: even if you know your stuff, not everyone has perfect memory
18:20  reisio: people without perfect memory are lame
18:20  ikonia: I don't believe you can cheat the RHCE without a certain standard of knowledge built in
18:20  PingFloyd: ikonia: that's why references and docs were invented
18:20  ^Rehan: ikonia: send me PM ?
18:20  Blockcold: reisio: RHCE exam only this imap,samba,ftp,httpd,selinux,password changing,RAid Or LVM,sharing a dirctory :P

18:23  ikonia: Blockcold: where did you take your practical exam
18:23  PingFloyd: also, photographic memory and understanding how things work are two different things as well.
18:23  Blockcold: at my institute which you know
18:23  ikonia: Blockcold: I don't know
18:23  ikonia: which one
18:24  Blockcold: ikonia: you are wasting your time on me go you have lots of work
18:24  reisio: PingFloyd: which would you prefer more, though? :)
18:24  ikonia: Blockcold: which institute
18:24  PingFloyd: reisio: someone with good understanding and skill
18:25  reisio: PingFloyd: no I mean personally
18:25  Blockcold: UPTECH xD
18:25  reisio: given that remembering things makes it easy to learn things
18:25  PingFloyd: reisio: same way
18:25  reisio: I only hire Ken Thompson, personally
18:25  PingFloyd: reisio: because I've known people with great memories that are terrible
18:26  reisio: PingFloyd: terrible at what?
18:26  PingFloyd: reisio: terrible in their field
18:26  reisio: they probably really have crap memories :p
18:26  ikonia: Blockcold: uptech is not a certified exam centre for Red Hat
18:26  PingFloyd: they don't understand how things work, they just remember which buttons to press
18:27  reisio: sounds like a product of a broken education system
18:27  PingFloyd: that's because the education system emphasizing being able to memorize useless facts
18:27  reisio: passing tests
18:27  Blockcold: ikonia: but i done my RHCE at that institute :P
18:27  PingFloyd: yep, passing tests
18:27  ikonia: Blockcold: then you lie as that is not a valid test centre
18:27  PingFloyd: education is so little about learning, it's not even funny
18:28  PingFloyd: it's about listening to someone lecture in class and memorizing the drivel
18:28  GNU\colossus: education quite often isn't funny at all, actually.

18:29  PingFloyd: it's a very passive learning approach
18:29  Blockcold: PingFloyd: its all about pactice
18:29  Blockcold: daily do a same questions
18:29  jmbc_vamos_rafa: it is funny when you start to know more than teachers and they still refuse to admit
18:29  PingFloyd: only one that is active is the instructor, and they wonder why people fall asleep in class

18:31  lautriv: i'll slepp a few minutes, may someone send me a beep if the troll is vanished ? :-)
18:31  reisio: so... someone pretending to have taken the RHCE is a troll?
18:31  reisio: didn't we have posers before we had trolls?
18:31  lautriv: reiso, no but perpetually repeating is.
18:32  reisio: no it isn't...
