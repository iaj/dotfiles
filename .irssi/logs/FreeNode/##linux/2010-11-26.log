00:01  Cmdr_W_T_Riker: so i took over my desktop with vnc, then i intended to suspend my laptop (fn-f1), but instead the desktop went to sleep :/
00:01  sauvin: Did it snore or drool?
00:02  Fieldy: heh oops
00:02  Cmdr_W_T_Riker: very funny, sauvin :-)
00:02  jelly-home: if you have a water-resistant Toughbook, can it sleep with the fishes?
00:02 * jelly-home hides
00:02  JoeHazzers: i am seriously not in the mood to make a bash script that cuts up a URL, writes to cookies.txt, and then wgets the url
00:03  a1fa: does anyone know what happened with xshipwars?
00:04  loomsen: JoeHazzers: why not
00:05  JoeHazzers: how would i cut up a url, say http://sub.domain.tld/whatever/something.ext?e=alphanumeric&f=alphanumeric
00:05  Psi-Jack: Hmmm
00:05  Psi-Jack: And the difference between suspend and sleep is?
00:06  JoeHazzers: where i overwrite a line in cookies.txt with everything after the ?
00:06  JoeHazzers: and wget the full url
00:09  Alumin: Psi-Jack: I think the difference is that sleep writes the contents of RAM to disk and shuts down
00:09  Alumin: the OS is expected to recognize and reload the memory image at boot time
00:10  Alumin: suspend just does stuff like park the hard disk to aggressively minimize power consumption...with sleep/hibernate you actually have no power consumption
00:10  loomsen: JoeHazzers: foo="http://sub.domain.tld/whatever/something.ext?e=alphanumeric&f=alphanumeric"; sed 's/^.*[?]//' <<<"$foo" >> coockies.txt; wget "$foo"
00:11  Psi-Jack: Alumin: Isn't that called Hibernate? Not sleep?
00:11  JoeHazzers: loomsen: please can you explain after the first semocolon?
00:11  Alumin: I thought sleep and hibernate were the same thing...if not then clearly I don't know what I'm talking about
00:11  Psi-Jack: Nope.
00:12  Psi-Jack: Sleep = Suspend, Hibernate = Hibernate
00:12  JoeHazzers: hibernate writes the ram to disk, then shuts down, moving it back to ram on boot
00:12  JoeHazzers: iirc
00:12  Psi-Jack: Sleep/Suspend uses STR (Store to Ram), or the other mode, I forget off the top of my head, and hibernate flushes to the hard drive and completely powers off.
00:12  Alumin: oh ok so it's sleep and suspend that are synonyms, not hibernate and suspend
00:12  Psi-Jack: Bingo
00:12  JoeHazzers: hibernate is when linux bungs up it's ass for winter and sleeps
00:13  Psi-Jack: So, as I said, Cmdr_W_T_Riker, what's the difference? heh
00:13  Alumin: next laptop I buy I'm gonna make sure the hardware and OS support hibernate
00:13  loomsen: JoeHazzers: sed substitutes everything(.*) from the start (^) to the first ?, this is done from reading the variable foo(<<<"$foo") and the result is redirected to coockies.txt(>>coockies.txt); then wget get the full url (wget "$foo)
00:13  Alumin: oh speaking of which, one thing I always wanted to ask
00:13  Alumin: when it hibernates, does it need a special partition or does it just find free space somewhere?
00:14  Psi-Jack: Alumin: It uses swap, in linux.
00:14  Alumin: (or does it need unpartitioned space)
00:14  Psi-Jack: So, you need as much swap as physical ram.
00:14  Alumin: oh ok
00:14  Psi-Jack: Plus whatever else is swapped.
00:14  Alumin: what about the stuff you already had in swap at ... yeah. :)
00:14  JoeHazzers: loomsen: ah, that makes perfect sense. one more question. can i get sed to substitute that into a specific line
00:14  dodddummy: HEY! finally and answer to 'how much swap do i need?"
00:14  [steeve]: hello
00:14  Psi-Jack: dodddummy: You never asked.
00:14  [steeve]: I've created a pam module which call a function in an other .c file but the call to this function always fail. do you know why ? (PS : the function works in a normal program)
00:14  loomsen: JoeHazzers: what do you mean by that
00:15 --- toagac_ is now known as DarkToagac
00:15  Alumin: dodddummy: my answer to that is "zero"...unless you need to hibernate of course
00:15  Alumin: or if you're rrrrrreally cheap on RAM
00:15  JoeHazzers: loomsen: i have ".domain.com    TRUE    /    FALSE    2147385600	bgsecuredir e=alphanumeric&f=alphanumeric" in the cookies.txt, how would i replace that with the new content?
00:16  dodddummy: guess the joke nature of that question didn't come across
00:16  Alumin: I've been running various versions of KDE 4 (nothing earlier than 4.2.2, though) for quite a long time now on 2GB RAM with no swap, haven't run out of memory yet
00:16  dodddummy: or of that statemnt
00:16  loomsen: JoeHazzers: new content as in just the last column?
00:16  Alumin: heh
00:16  Alumin: wait, it's not still "2x RAM"?  :P
00:17  JoeHazzers: loomsen: as in i want that e=...&f=... replaced with the new values
00:17  pfred1: I can run fluxbox on 32MB of RAm
00:17  loomsen: JoeHazzers: which new values please
00:17  Alumin: Psi-Jack: do you know if it's possible to tell the hibernation routing to use "file xyz" for the memory dump (so I don't have to start using swap if I want to be able to hibernate)?
00:18  JoeHazzers: loomsen: when you get rid of everything before the ? with sed, you are left with e=whatever&f=whatever
00:18  JoeHazzers: i want to replace the content in cookies.txt with the one from sed
00:18  Psi-Jack: Alumin: No idea. I only know what I know based on other conversations here. I don't actually use Linux on my laptop.
00:18  Alumin: GASP  :P
00:18  [steeve]: no PAM expert here ?
00:18  Alumin: ok cool, when the time comes I'll look into it further
00:22  loomsen: JoeHazzers: bar=".domain.com    TRUE    /    FALSE    2147385600 bgsecuredir e=alphanumeric&f=alphanumeric"; sed -r 's@(.*)\s(e=.*)$@\1 HELLO JOE@' <<<$bar
00:23  Freddy2: so must i have a local dns server in order to get a response from "dig" (dns client) if i'm trying to resolve a name i've previously manually added to /etc/hosts? i mean, i add -> "1.2.3.4  fake.name" (no quotes) and i get no response with dig fake.name
00:23  JoeHazzers: loomsen: what's with the hello joe?
00:24  loomsen: JoeHazzers: it should just show how it works
00:24  Alumin: Freddy2: dig is specifically a DNS test tool, it doesn't consult /etc/hosts
00:24  loomsen: so you can make up the rest yourself :)
00:24  JoeHazzers: ah
00:24  Alumin: Freddy2: if you want to see what the whole "resolver infrastructure" is getting for a hostname, try ping
00:25  JoeHazzers: loomsen: i can see where this is going
00:25  JoeHazzers: thank you very much for your help, it's much appreciated.
00:25  Alumin: I actually did try to figure out a way to do that (see what the resolver gets) without actually having to send a packet out, but I don't think I ever managed it
00:26  loomsen: JoeHazzers: yw
00:26  Freddy2: in fact i'm having this problem in subclipse (javaHL engine), which works fine by using the ip address when i try to connect to a SVN repo, but fails with the fake name :/
00:26  Freddy2: i think it's the same situation than using dig directly
00:28  Alumin: that's odd
00:28  JoeHazzers: loomsen: if i put it this way... i get the new e=&f= from the first sed on the url, then, i want to replace the ".domain.com    TRUE    /    FALSE    2147385600 bgsecuredir e=alphanumeric&f=alphanumeric" e and f values, basically the result from the first sed
00:28  Alumin: presumably that means it's not using the OS resolver routines
00:28  JoeHazzers: is that what you thought i meant?
00:28  shafire: hi
00:28  shafire: how can i add a static ip to dhcp?
00:28  Alumin: Freddy2: if that is in fact the case, you may be stuck with running a DNS server if you want the name resolution
00:29  Alumin: shafire: configure dhcpd to recognize the machine's MAC address and assign the same IP every time
00:29 --- n3mo is now known as n3mo`movie
00:29  jelly-home: Alumin: fwiw, instead of ping, getent hosts foo
00:29  loomsen: JoeHazzers: yes kinda
00:29  shafire: Alumin: i have two ips
00:29  Alumin: orly
00:29  shafire: the first is okay, the second never assigned
00:30  JoeHazzers: i might have just made this much simpler
00:30  JoeHazzers: it is always line 2 of the file
00:30  JoeHazzers: so i'd just want to replace everything on line 2
00:30  Freddy2: Alumin: the network management doesn't depend on me.. the goal was having a fake naming scheme for my eclipse projects, making easier a possible change of ip at the repo
00:31  Freddy2: in windows it's easy by adding this entry to the hosts file, it works fine, and i expected to be the same in linux
00:31  Alumin: jelly-home: hey, thanks :)
00:32  Freddy2: sure, it works with get-ent XD
00:32  Freddy2: *getent
00:32  loomsen: JoeHazzers: sed '2s/foo/bar/'
00:33  Fallen77: lautriv, do you happen to be here?
00:34  loomsen: Fallen77: he told me i should tell you he's not
00:34  Diverdude: will this card http://pchdtv.com/ run on ubuntu?
00:34  Fallen77: loomsen, makes sense
00:35  loomsen: Fallen77: [23:05] <lautriv> dieser FAllen 77 auf ##linux braucht zu lange, ich geh ins bett. wär nett wenn ihm jemand bescheid sagen könnte.
00:35  Freddy2: well, i'll give it a try tomorrow
00:35  loomsen: Fallen77: google translate :)
00:35  JoeHazzers: loomsen: how would i send the output of sed to a parameter?
00:36  tensorpudding: a parameter?
00:36  loomsen: ma thought exactly
00:36  Fallen77: loomsen, ok, thanks ^^
00:36  loomsen: my*
00:36  JoeHazzers: sorry, it's late
00:36  JoeHazzers: :S
00:36  _r00t-: hello everybody...i have a problem with my new hdd... i copied ( cp -a ) from the old disk250gb hdd  (ext4) partition to the new one 1.5tb hdd ext4 partition ....now both disks have the same data but on the new partition files are taking 17gb more
00:36  tensorpudding: you mean like what xargs does?
00:36  _r00t-: what's wrong ?
00:36  JoeHazzers: i meant a variable
00:36  tensorpudding: oh
00:36  _r00t-: tune2fs -l  /dev/.... on both partitions are the same
00:36  tensorpudding: foo=`sed ...` maybe
00:37  _r00t-: same inode size ...
00:37  _r00t-: :/
00:37  loomsen: $() instead of ``
00:37  dark3lf: Hello, do you know if a world map program exist in command line ?
00:38  loomsen: nice question
00:39  JoeHazzers: i am a bit of a noob in this area, but how would i set a variable with the $ and parentheses?
00:39  metalfoo: I am wondering whether someone ever thought to port Google Earth to aalib.
00:40  share: Does somebody know how to extract subtitles from a Bluray disc?
00:40  share: *Bluray disc which is not encrypted
00:41 --- MuzerAway is now known as Muzer
00:41  dark3lf: loomsen: yeah, I am looking for something like a digital map in ascii or any kind of advanced map in command line, text-only
00:42  loomsen: JoeHazzers: foo="$(echo hello $(whoami))"; echo $foo
00:42  JoeHazzers: got it
00:42  loomsen: dark3lf: please let me know if you find one :)
00:43  dark3lf: ok
00:43  share: hm seems that i need to use Windows software on a Linux machine to do what i want
00:44  rbarraud: anyone here able to point me to kernel device-drivers-specific IRC channel please?
00:44  loomsen: share: never did it cause i think dics are medieval ^^ but ffmpeg or mplayer will most likely provide the capabilities
00:44  DLange: dark3lf: what do you want to do with it? If only overlaying some data/notifications, http://www.codeismylife.com/ascii_world_map/17491.html and some scripting may help
00:45  share: loomsen: dics?
00:45  loomsen: discs*
00:45  share: loomsen: ok i mean image
00:45  share: is a virtual disc
00:45  loomsen: mount -o loop image.iso /some/where
00:45  share: yes it's mounted already
00:46  metalfoo: dark3lf: Well, you can imagine that it is quite pointless to display images with high detail grades in ASCII, right? That's probably the reason why noone ever thought about to do that. But as said, there is aalib, try your best ;)
00:47  loomsen: share: http://code.google.com/p/swiss-army-knife/wiki/LinuxShell
00:48  loomsen: share: look at that maybe, ffmpeg will most likely also be able to do it... i really don't know anything about bluray
00:49  share: loomsen: ok tks
00:51  rbarraud: bluray -> ASCII art, eh? ... and I thought Snoopy calendars were kewl :)
00:52  share: ?
00:53  metalfoo: rbarraud: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/images/screenshots/aa-03.png
00:57  loomsen: metalfoo: franka potente?
00:58  metalfoo: loomsen: Don't know? Chances are. The resolution isn't that high actually. ;)  I wanted to point out, that it _is_ possible to watch BluRay movies in ASCII
00:58  ananke: and for color, try cacalib instead
00:59  Supergirl: Mmmm, homemade bisuits!
00:59  Supergirl: From a book, not a can! :)
00:59  Supergirl: Made 'em myself!
01:01  juanmabcirc: this business is binary
01:02  marduk: werd
01:11  Jam3s2002: why does control flow elude me so?
01:12  juanmabcirc: cause you are out of flow control
01:12  Jam3s2002: rofl
01:12  Jam3s2002: I mean, I just don't understand it
01:13  marduk: it's the new hotness
01:13  Jam3s2002: I mean, I semi-understand it in bash scripting
01:13  Jam3s2002: but I can't seem to apply it to other languages
01:14 --- sanchaz is now known as sanchaz-away
01:14  marduk: :|
01:14  marduk: i always thought bash would be the most difficult
01:14  Jam3s2002: it doesn't help that the python documentation is centered around math applications
01:14  Jam3s2002: shell scripting works just about the same as working the command line
01:14  loomsen: i thought its focus was on indentation
01:15  marduk: because bash is so retarded
01:15  marduk: i mean
01:15  juanmabcirc: sure...
01:15  marduk: flaky
01:15  marduk: like pie
01:16  gordboy: surely maths is the key to computing
01:16  loomsen: dont bash bash
01:16  marduk: nah
01:16  marduk: no i like bashes
01:16  marduk: just not bash "programming"
01:17  gordboy: if you can't understand basic mathematical ideas, then computing will forever be a distant mirage
01:17  loomsen: damn childhood memories, i still associate bash with wrestling - wcw bash at the beach :D
01:17  Jam3s2002: I understand shell scripting... in fact, I wrote the program that I'm trying to port to python as a shell script
01:18  Jam3s2002: gordboy, negative, people who aren't mathematically inclined can use computers just the same, and even learn to program very practical applications
01:18  marduk: try perl then
01:18  marduk: (omg i can't believe i just said that)
01:18  Jam3s2002: I just need to use basic
01:18  gordboy: Jam3s2002: if you say so
01:18  juanmabcirc: one line executes after another line, like you read left to right
01:18  loomsen: Jam3s2002: i disagree and completely agree with gordboy
01:19  share: Why gnome keeps showing these mount points http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/1479/mnt.png if they are already unmounted? (only if I restart it goes away)
01:19  share: help
01:19  loomsen: restart? as in, restart the computer?
01:20  juanmabcirc: fuzzy fun loomsen?
01:20  share: loomsen: yes
01:20  Jam3s2002: loomsen, gordboy: what math is used in an application written in a higher-level scripting language to fetch a few files from a server?
01:20  marduk: oh wow
01:20  marduk: many
01:20  share: loomsen: sometimes it goes away if i mount the image again and unmount otherwise even logout and login doesnt solve the problem
01:21  gordboy: Jam3s2002: idempotency, projection and closure, to name but 3
01:21  marduk: Jam3s2002: what specifically are you not understanding? and did you try drawing a flow chart (or whatever kids are doing these days)?
01:21  juanmabcirc: Jam3s2002: one in with the filenames are solutions to equations (0.0)
01:22  marduk: oops
01:22  marduk: i think i confused users
01:22  Mish-: If I'm having issue with a (bad) filesystem driver (segmentation fault) after mounting and unmounting, yet it works after reboot... Is there any way to "clean" the memory it (or the kernel) are using.. rmmod (even -f) doesn't work.
01:22  marduk: no, nm
01:22  juanmabcirc: really?
01:22  Jam3s2002: marduk, yeah, I've got flow charts... actually, I've got a lot. my real issue is that I can't understand the structure of the language. I'm not really much of a programmer to begin with
01:23  marduk: Jam3s2002: are you asking for help?
01:23  Jam3s2002: nah, just venting
01:23  marduk: ic
01:23  marduk: so it's ok to ignore then :D
01:23  pcard: does anywhere know the earlier point of logging in that PATH gets set at? I notice if I login as root, the beginning of PATH is contains /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:, else it contains /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:
01:23  pcard: the weird thing is, /etc/profile is only setting the sbin's at the beginning
01:24  fixxxermet: I am trying to setup a ssh chroot and am having trouble with bash.
01:24  pcard: if the   if [ `id -u` = 0 ]; then    condition is met
01:24  pcard: any anyone know where or what is adding the bin's and how it is adding the bin's after each sbin
01:24  fixxxermet: I keep getting /bin/bash: no such file or directory.
01:24  Jam3s2002: marduk, it is indeed, but if anyone knows of python tutorials that don't use math applications as examples, I'd like to know
01:25  Jam3s2002: fixxxermet, you haven't installed bash
01:25  Jam3s2002: or you don't have permissions
01:25  Jam3s2002: have you tried sudo?
01:25  marduk: Jam3s2002: i do agree with most though that programing is math.. some classes even teach it as an extension of math
01:25  marduk: Jam3s2002: but i think the official python tutorial doesn't use math examples
01:25  gordboy: pcard: /etc/environment is often implicated in such matters
01:25  marduk: uness it's like basic math
01:25  fixxxermet: Jam3s2002: bash is definitely installed and logging in as any user but the chroot'ed user works
01:25  marduk: you do know basic math right?
01:25  fixxxermet: again, this is via ssh
01:25  Jam3s2002: marduk, all of the applications function as calculators...
01:25 --- Muzer is now known as MuzerAway
01:25  pcard: gordboy: I don't have that file
01:26  Jam3s2002: marduk, and I do know math, but for me, it is difficult to read the examples
01:26  marduk: well
01:26  marduk: since you are not asking for help
01:26  marduk: i dont' think i can help you lol
01:27  gordboy: pcard: grep -Rl PATH /etc, will return all (global) references to PATH
01:27  Jam3s2002: marduk, I'll figure it out eventually. I prefer to sit on a problem until I can work it out in my head... I seem to learn better that way
01:27  pcard: gordboy: I wish to find out how it is being set the way it is. /etc/profile only prepends the sbin's, which means they should be consequitive, but something else is adding the bin's _after_ each sbin in the beginning of PATH
01:27  pcard: gordboy: I've already grpped /etc
01:27  marduk: ok if sitting on your head helps...
01:28  gordboy: *consecutive
01:28  pcard: oops, thank
01:28  pcard: s
01:28  juanmabcirc: Jam3s2002: control flow is more related to logic
01:29  marduk: yeah
01:29  marduk: but logic is math.. simple math though.. (if you dont' think about it too much)
01:29  loomsen: heh
01:30  loomsen: first thought is always correct
01:31  marduk: you can draw pictures though
01:31  juanmabcirc: Jam3s2002: the flow keywords of the language like: for, while, if, ... put you in of flow control
01:31  marduk: like flow charts and k-maps
01:31  gordboy: the basic problem here seems to be what i call the "proud ignorance of the newsreader"
01:31 --- JmZ is now known as JmZ_
01:32  Jam3s2002: I know all of this... its python's flow control that is throwing me. for some reason it just doesn't work out in my brain.... its more of a learning issue than anything
01:32  juanmabcirc: gordboy: in contrast with the one from the newswriter
01:32  Jam3s2002: I've got charts of what I want the application to do, I'm just not the best programmer
01:32  gordboy: how many times have we heard "i was never any good at maths", as though that were a _positive_ quality ?
01:33  loomsen: lol
01:33  loomsen: really?
01:33  Jam3s2002: I know some math
01:33  juanmabcirc: gordboy: well, you are human, not a chip )
01:33  Jam3s2002: I know some programming
01:33  Jam3s2002: but I don't know some python
01:33  Jam3s2002: but I will
01:33  gordboy: "here's jack, with the weather"
01:33  Jam3s2002: as soon as I can find some really simple documentation on it
01:33  loomsen: rofl
01:34  Umeaboy: I haven't really been following what you're discussing, but I have a different point of view when it comes to learn people math.
01:34  juanmabcirc: say!
01:34  gordboy: pray divulse, squire
01:35  marduk: http://www.sthurlow.com/python/lesson02/
01:35  JoeHazzers: how can i essentially grep a webpage?
01:35  marduk: it has maths though
01:35  marduk: like 1+1
01:36  gordboy: marduk: in my country we make a (necessary) distinction between arithmetic and maths
01:36  juanmabcirc: JoeHazzers: type "curl -s wegpage" and see
01:36  marduk: ok
01:36  JoeHazzers: juanmabcirc: and how do you only return the found (red) text with grep?
01:37  gordboy: i accept that some boundaries are synthetic. like "is dsp maths, statistics or engineering ?"
01:38  juanmabcirc: Joe: man grep, exact match, -o -w or something (i always re-man it)
01:38  JoeHazzers: oh, it's return match
01:38  JoeHazzers: makes sense i guess
01:38  JoeHazzers: thanks, i had PuTTY closed
01:38  JoeHazzers: :x
01:39  juanmabcirc: ok
01:39  marduk: maybe that's not such a good tutorial
01:39  Umeaboy: Well........if you take one pile of dirt.
01:39  juanmabcirc: the python.org one is veery simple
01:40  marduk: but... i don't think there will be many (any) to satisfy your requirement
01:40  Umeaboy: Place it on top of another pile of dirt. How many piles do you get?
01:40  Umeaboy: Nothing in between to seperate them.
01:40  Umeaboy: You get ONE.
01:40  juanmabcirc: the point is some dirts have common properties
01:41  Umeaboy: Take one fertile man, one fertile woman. Let them make love. In nine months............... what do you get out of it?
01:41  Umeaboy: THREE humans.
01:41  Umeaboy: Not two.
01:41  juanmabcirc: ouch, a hole in the budget
01:41  Umeaboy: 1 + 1 doesn't always equal 2.
01:41  marduk: court costs
01:41  gordboy: Umeaboy: yes, nice. just as "half a pile of dirt" or "half a piece of chalk" is nonsense. but the clue is in the word pile. to me that is singular. i.e. not more and not less than one
01:42  juanmabcirc: lol, (thinking about the triplets)
01:42  marduk: :S
01:42  Umeaboy: How can you say a half-filled glass is ONE glass when it's half-filled?
01:43  Iron_Chef: howdy all
01:43  Umeaboy: When you poor something into the glass, you fill the glass to the edge.
01:43  Umeaboy: Right?
01:43  Iron_Chef: is there a way to force a process into D state?
01:43  marduk: pour
01:43  juanmabcirc: Umeaboy: i can say it's both
01:43  Iron_Chef: I want to test a monitoring script
01:43  Umeaboy: juanmabcirc: How?
01:43  Umeaboy: Collaborate.
01:44  juanmabcirc: and i am with your point
01:46  Umeaboy: Today.......... the school doesn't explain to you that you CAN count like I DID, 'cause that's "WRONG".
01:46  Umeaboy: How's that wrong?
01:47  Umeaboy: MY way of counting is much more simpler.
01:47  juanmabcirc: he he, ha ha
01:47  juanmabcirc: want a mic?
01:47  Umeaboy: juanmabcirc: Uuuuuuuuuuuuhm. NO.
01:48  juanmabcirc: lol
01:49  juanmabcirc: what i don't like are people that first shows you the wrong way, then if they have time shows you the good way to solve something
01:49  juanmabcirc: i specially like that "if they have time"
01:51  infinitux: xfce4 always reverts me to a wallpaper I don't want.
01:51  gordboy: Iron_Chef: i take it you mean from within the process. you could issue a "read" that will never complete
01:51  infinitux: How come it's doing this?
01:52  juanmabcirc: infinituxus: you are not storing session (?)
01:52  marduk: i just started playing with xfce
01:52  Iron_Chef: gordboy: mmm, I don't really want to write a test process, I was hoping there was something nasty I could do to a happily running process to stun it
01:52  infinitux: each time I reboot, I'm forced to open the wallpaper settings and reconfigure it to the one I want. Also I always have to move the volume up to max.
01:52  infinitux: juanmabcirc: I'm storing it. programs and stuff remember to open.
01:52  infinitux: Just those settings are annoying.
01:54  gordboy: Iron_Chef: not sure if that is (easily) possible. most process states are self-inflicted
01:55  juanmabcirc: infinitux: for the volume i think alsactl (websearch) can save it, the wallpaper some #xfce channel would know the details
01:55  jlebar: I just created a btrfs partition mounted it and ran |chown jlebar mount-point| and |chgrp jlebar mount-point|, but now my regular user account still doesn't have permission to modify the partition.  What am I missing?
01:57  infinitux: i'll do that. thanks juanmabcirc
01:57  juanmabcirc: no problem!
01:58  marduk: jlebar: do you mean partition or filesystem? they are not the same things (and have seperate permissions)?
01:58  jlebar: marduk, I'm...not sure.  I chown'ed the directory I'd given to mount as the mount point.
01:58  juanmabcirc: that's interesting jlebar, because i mix a lot mount point rights, and mounted filesystem rights
01:59  jlebar: juanmabcirc, if I make a directory inside the mount point and chown that, it works.
01:59  marduk: jlebar: i think what you're saying is, you changed the directory that you are mounting over, but you did not change the permission of the mount itself.. those are sperate also
01:59  marduk: seperate*
01:59  jlebar: marduk, okay, I believe that.
01:59  juanmabcirc: yeah, that could be marduk!
02:00  Umeaboy: Stupid HAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
02:00  Umeaboy: I wish HAL whould just go away!!!!!
02:00 * juanmabcirc is storing "rights of the mount itself" into non volatile
02:01  Umeaboy: Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
02:02  Umeaboy: When changing the mount-point of my DVD-player from /media/cdrom to /media/DVD-player & then mount the DVD manually when HAL has mounted the device my issue seems to disappear.
02:03  Umeaboy: Weird.
02:03  Umeaboy: How can I reproduce the bug again?
02:03  Umeaboy: I saw a message that the disc couldn't be mounted before I changed the mounting-point.
02:03  Umeaboy: Any ideas anyone?
02:04  juanmabcirc: .o(stupid hal is not reproducing bug)
02:04  marduk: well
02:04  marduk: usually we ask the person with the problem for the reproducer.. not the other way around
02:05  juanmabcirc: ,o(how to solve?, how to solve?)
02:05  Umeaboy: I'm reporting this error to QA, but I still need the info I saw.
02:05  Umeaboy: Do I have to look in the entire dmesg to see that?
02:07  juanmabcirc: i miss some info related to "when changing the mount-point of my DVD-player from /media/cdrom to /media/DVD-player" bug is not reproduced
02:07  juanmabcirc: and "mounted manually"
02:09  Umeaboy: How rude of the firewall to add output into messages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
02:09  juanmabcirc: that's could be a different .o(stupid-)hal scene
02:10  Umeaboy: juanmabcirc: I thought changing the mountpoint to something else whould enable my device to become mounted.
02:11  juanmabcirc: i mean the "mounted manually", perhaps bug is in automount
02:12  juanmabcirc: as to reproduce to report QA, do not change mount default point
02:12  marduk: omg
02:13  marduk: i just now realized i passed the wrong parameter to (long running) script
02:13  marduk: now i must run it again :(
02:13  juanmabcirc: nice, are you in your os ram?
02:13  juanmabcirc: he
02:17  marduk: :S
02:24  rbarraud: bluray ASCII lolz - thanks for that :)
02:24  rbarraud: now we just need some 300Mbps VT100
02:25  rbarraud: 's with 1920x1080 character screen modifications :)
02:25  rbarraud: BTW does it work in real-time?
02:29  rbarraud: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/images/screenshots/cvidix-02.jpg
02:29  rbarraud: lolz -- that wouldn't be distracting at all, eh? ;-)
02:30  FreezingCold: How do I run ZNC as nobody?
02:30  juanmabcirc: mppf
02:30  metalfoo: rbarraud: It does, sure. aalib does the ASCII output and mplayer has a video output driver to use it.
02:31  metalfoo: That is, you really can watch your BluRays in ASCII.
02:32  juanmabcirc: but after the lolz, y0u are n0t g0ing t0 see it.
02:32  FreezingCold: How do I run ZNC as nobody?
02:32  Umeaboy: juanmadcirc: This is all output of the time before I changed the mountpoint to after I did it I manually mounted the DVD: http://umeaboy.pastebin.com/vHegrdc1
02:33  Umeaboy: juanmabcirc: ^^
02:33  faustisch: hi, I want to route my linux machine's connection through an ssh tunnel. please give me some hints
02:34  FreezingCold: How do I run ZNC as nobody?  I get -ash: sudo: not found when I run sudo -u nobody znc
02:34  Umeaboy: That's a HAL-problem, right?
02:35  rbarraud: faustisch: RTFM? HTH ;-)
02:35  faustisch: faustisch, shall somehow configure OpenVPN to route through the SSH tunnel?
02:35  faustisch: rbarraud, oh yes :D it's in the man page, thank you

02:36  faustisch: rbarraud, good my Safari Bookshelf will be expired on Nov 30
02:36  rbarraud: faustisch:
02:37  juanmabcirc: Umeaboy: i see kernel i/o errors which usually means bad disk
02:38  rbarraud: faustisch: Safari renewal time then :) ... wish I could afford it
02:39  Umeaboy: juanmabcirc: Right. I'll try a new disc that I haven't played yet.
02:39  Umeaboy: A case that I haven't opened.
02:40  faustisch: rbarraud, I can't afford it either, it was a birthday gift from my dad; living in Iran... amazon won't ship to here, it sucks you know, freaking medieval mus;
02:40  faustisch: muslims
02:41  rbarraud: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7881?page=0,1
02:42  faustisch: rbarraud, what's worse... I need the ssh tunnel to apt-get update Ubuntu, Ubuntu has blocked Iran-based IPs
02:42  rbarraud: wow
02:42  rbarraud: nasteh
02:42  faustisch: yeah goll dang nasty
02:42 * faustisch is ashamed of being an Iranian
02:43  metalfoo: faustisch: See it positive. It could be worse.
02:43  rbarraud: dont blame yourself for hundreds of years of history (and tyranny) faustisch
02:43  juanmabcirc: man, i hate that split articles! (is the article good, read all links, pfff)
02:43  klemax: which php handler is more secure?
02:43  sauvin: Merely hundreds?
02:44  metalfoo: Like being ... North Korean citizen.
02:44  rbarraud: well since ~680AD anyway
02:44  rbarraud: ...or on a South Korean Island near the North
02:45  rbarraud: OT! OT! stopping now
02:45  metalfoo: heh
02:45  faustisch: metalfoo, we will overthrow the tyrant theocracy, the victory is close
02:45  faustisch: ;)
02:45  rbarraud: faustisch: i hope you
02:45  rbarraud: are righ
02:45  rbarraud: right*
02:46  Umeaboy: HAL mounts the device, not the disc, right?
02:46  Umeaboy: Or am I wrong?
02:47  metalfoo: faustisch: Just go on and continue to build nuclear power plants. As soon as as Palin is US president, our dear US friends will help you to get rid of Ahmadinejad
02:49 --- indrorafk is now known as indrora

02:53  bagira: i have found it almost impossible to get a button map of all the buttons on this madcatz xbox 360 usb gamepad; is there a way to just have the system tell me the name of the button?
02:53  bagira: instead of mapping it out as 'x, y, a, b' on the backend, they do 'button 1,2,3,4' so you have no idea which button you're programming when you're playing a game
02:56  juanmabcirc: bagira: while not exit do: for all buttons: print button state line; done
02:56  juanmabcirc: and press'hem
02:57  rbarraud: how many buttons are there?
02:58  juanmabcirc: he, nice q, you could just print the pressed
02:58  rbarraud: annotate a photo shot with the button numbers reported - then write a conversion table
02:59  rbarraud: i.e. push 'em and observe what they are called
02:59  rbarraud: i am about to solve something similar on embedded H/W :)
03:00  rbarraud: gotta focus on getting audio going now though
03:00  juanmabcirc: what would be the developers thinking for not to add this table (??)
03:01  juanmabcirc: yeah, you know it, button 3 see your gamepa.. (err)
03:01  WIIman: happy thanksgiving all
03:01  rbarraud: WIIman: U 2 :)

03:01  WIIman: ty
03:02  juanmabcirc: it's the festive school day in here, he he!
03:03  rbarraud: maybe M$ lawyers threatened a copyright lawsuit if they called out the 'copyrighted' names for the buttons ... :(
03:03 --- WIIman is now known as twinkie_addict
03:03  rbarraud: where u juanmabcirc ?
03:04  rbarraud: actually not much celebrating down here since Pike River mine explosions :(
03:04  rbarraud: very sad
03:04  twinkie_addict: yeh sad
03:04  juanmabcirc: rbarraud: sshh, be quiet, do not give that ideas
03:04  juanmabcirc: Spain, Europe
03:04  juanmabcirc: you?
03:05  rbarraud: not that long after a similar number of Chilean miners were rescued... using some NZ technology... an explosion is a whole othr ballgame though :(
03:05  twinkie_addict: in us but i follow things
03:05  rbarraud: juanmabcirc: New Zealand
03:05  Mish-: What can I use to decompile a .ko file?
03:06  rbarraud: twinkie_addict: 100 points for knowing anything non-US :) well done... you have escaped the evil clutches of Murdochdom
03:06  twinkie_addict: lol ty i like to stay non ignorant of the world around me
03:06  rbarraud: if its not stripped i think it's a normal ELF format - so objdump -s should do it?
03:07  rbarraud: there are people who go out of their way to characterize (U.S.) Americans as ignorant and boorish ... I'm not buying it
03:08  rbarraud: without having spent some time there, I think it's very unfair to gauge
03:08  Umeaboy: Can't reprocude my problem even with a brand new DVD.
03:08  Umeaboy: reproduce
03:08  rbarraud: i think of myself as basically American in mindset
03:08  Umeaboy: I just opened the case.
03:09  twinkie_addict: there are some us people that descust me they think there better than any one else in the world , dont get me wrong i love my contry but i hate closed minded arogance and ignorance
03:09  Mish-: What can I use to decompile a .ko file?
03:09  rbarraud: since there's only 1/100th of the stuff happening here, our typical news tends to be more outward-looking :)
03:10  marduk: disgust
03:10  rbarraud: Mish objdump
03:10  rbarraud: Mish-: objdump
03:10  twinkie_addict: lol never claimed i could splell or type lol
03:10  rbarraud: if its not stripped you should see symbols
03:11  rbarraud: yeah splelling FTW :)
03:11  rbarraud: twinkie_addict: i think you can blame bad media for a lot of it
03:12  twinkie_addict: yeh
03:12  rbarraud: foreign interference (Murdoch)...
03:13  juanmabcirc: that's good to hear from usa
03:14  crocket: Does anybody use zfs here?
03:14  crocket: Is zfs stable or fast enough on linux?
03:15  marduk: haven't bothered with it
03:16  crocket: zfs supports easy backup using zfs snapshot.
03:16  jelly-home: crocket: it's very, very new if you're talking about the kernel module version.  As such, noone can really tell if it's stable.
03:16  crocket: jelly-home, how about zfs-fuse?
03:16  jelly-home: crocket: that's a nice proof of concept.
03:17  crocket: jelly-home, What's a nice proof of concept?
03:17  jelly-home: zfs-fuse is.
03:17  marduk: i haven't deemed my backups complicated enough to consider switching filesystems over
03:18  jelly-home: crocket: are you coming from a Solaris background? If you require zfs, I'd probably suggest staying there for at least 12 months
03:18  crocket: jelly-home, I'm using FreeBSD and slackware.
03:18  crocket: Since FreeBSD doesn't support 802.11n yet, I'm going to use slackware for my home server.
03:19  crocket: FreeBSD is known to support zfs natively although I don't know about performance on FreeBSD.
03:19  crocket: jelly-home, Is zfs-fuse or fuse-in-kernel not stable yet?
03:20  crocket: jelly-home, I was searching for a way to secure my hard drives. I didn't use zfs before.
03:21  jelly-home: crocket: I'd use a more conservative approach, something like a raid6 or raid5+hot spare with a well known filesystem.
03:21  crocket: Hmm zfs supports native nfs4 acls
03:22  crocket: jelly-home : Does ext4 support NFS4 ACLs?
03:22  jelly-home: crocket: nfs4 (in Linux especially) is too new for me to consider as well <g>
03:22  crocket: hmm
03:23  jelly-home: how/why are you using nfs4?
03:23  crocket: jelly-home, nfs4 is known to have more security features than nfs3.
03:23  jelly-home: are you using any of those?  Which ones?
03:24  marduk: jelly-home: i actually felt the opposite about nfs4 (when i was using it)
03:24  crocket: I currently use nfs3 due to ease of use on a private network.
03:24  crocket: On a global network, nfs3 is a hell
03:24  crocket: You don't know what hosts from the global network would try to connect.
03:24  jelly-home: nah, it's to be used over a secure channel
03:24  rbarraud: crocket: what's so special about 802.11n that it needs special OS support?
03:25  jelly-home: rbarraud: drivers?
03:25  crocket: rbarraud, FreeBSD doesn't support 802.11n
03:25  jelly-home: someone has to write them?
03:25  crocket: Once FreeBSD 802.11n support is established, 802.11n drivers can be written
03:25  crocket: FreeBSD really is an old operating system.
03:26  tensorpudding: it's got a lot of new fancy things in it though
03:26  crocket: tensorpudding, FreeBSD?
03:26  tensorpudding: yeah
03:27  crocket: What network file system and native file system do you choose for a home server?
03:27  tensorpudding: i use zfs currently
03:28  tensorpudding: but i don't run any network filesystems
03:29  kj4: ssh
03:29  tarikk: does v4l-info work for all cameras?
03:29  marduk: most of my file sharing needs seem to be taken care of by daap, upnp, or good ol' fashioned rsync
03:29  crocket: rsync
03:30  tensorpudding: i use unison
03:30  marduk: tarikk: all cameras are not supported.. so the easy answer is "no"
03:30  crocket: rsync will make your life harder if you want to use it to share files.
03:30  marduk: tarikk: but given that.. i've never seen a camera driver not use v4l[2]
03:31  tarikk: i just need to extract some hardware camera specs
03:31  crocket: tensorpudding, how does zfs work on linux?
03:31  tarikk: v4l-info the most detailed one.. how do i find out its color model?
03:31  tarikk: is*
03:32  tarikk: oh dw found it i think
03:37  rbarraud: crocket: what's to stop you using an ext '11n access point ? oh - are you wanting to run it on a lappie?
03:38  crocket: rbarraud, I wanted to use FreeBSD for a home server, but it's not possible since FreeBSD doesn't support 802.11n yet.
03:38  crocket: it could be after 2 years or next year.

03:40  Nullslash: -_-
03:45  rbarraud: crocket: AFAIK you should be able to use an 802.11n WiFi access point over Ethernet? ... i.e. since there is no actual '11n in the machine, it won't need drivers for it so you should be 'sweet as' as we say down here :)
03:45  rbarraud: well not me, lotsa others though :)
03:51  tensorpudding: crocket: i'm using zfs on freebsd
03:51  tensorpudding: i've not tried zfs-fuse, but my friend did, a few years ago, with some bad results
03:52  sauvin: It may have improved a bit since...
03:52  tensorpudding: yeah, that's possible
04:01  crocket: tensorpudding, In 2009, FreeBSD zfs was reported to have degrading performance issue with increasing uptime.
04:01  crocket: The performance decrease was about 1/5~10th.
04:02  crocket: Does it have no performance decrease now?
04:05  tensorpudding: never heard of that
04:06  tensorpudding: i've not experienced it
04:06  tensorpudding: but my server is not put under load
04:06  tensorpudding: it's mostly used for backups
04:06  tensorpudding: for my laptop
04:07  sauvin: Google it. It still exists but it may only be under certain conditions.
04:09  yagoo: anyone here using debian on a kernel >=2.6.36 ?
04:11  crocket: god
04:11  yagoo: crocket, atheist here.

04:15  yagoo: crocket, there is no knowledge in religion. I believe in engineering and science.
04:16  marduk: (sigh)
04:16  crocket: yagoo : It's a phrase spoken when I feel overwhelmed
04:16  crocket: like oh my god!!!
04:16  yagoo: crocket, you. not me.
04:16  yagoo: you don't speak for the channel.
04:16  crocket: yagoo : I speak for myself
04:17  yagoo: spaghetti monster.
04:17  yagoo: "!"
04:17  juanmabcirc: ha ha ha!
04:17  crocket: yagoo : you believe in science and I believe in me.
04:17  crocket: he
04:17  yagoo: and I believe in spaghetti monsters.
04:18  tensorpudding: way to derail the conversation
04:18  stwange: I'm having a strange issue. I've got a server (restored from another) that's refusing to boot. It gets into grub, tries to boot for a second or two, then just reboots. I've tried two kernels and single user, nothing works - what typically causes this?
04:18  sauvin: I believe I'll have some more turkey.
04:18  juanmabcirc: god is not anothers god, is yours
04:18  crocket: tensorpudding, Is zfs suitable for an operating system partiton?
04:19  crocket: "To include ZFS in the Linux kernel it would have to be cleanly reimplemented, and patents may hamper this."
04:20  crocket: "Another solution to this problem was to port ZFS to Linux's FUSE system so the filesystem runs in userspace instead, where it is not considered a derived work of the kernel."
04:20  sauvin: This implies to me that for the moment, since there'll be no modules for zfs, you can't boot linux from a zfs partition.
04:21  crocket: sauvin : tensorpudding uses zfs on FreeBSD.
04:21  sauvin: Which is why I specified linux, not knowing exactly what you were asking.
04:22  crocket: I'm not going to use zfs on my server anyway
04:23  crocket: The server will have linux
04:23  crocket: hmm
04:23  crocket: ext4 + RAID1 + rsnapshot?
04:23  sauvin: What are you looking for in an fs?
04:23  crocket: protection from hardware failure and bad sectors
04:23  crocket: and enough performance
04:24  crocket: RAID1 can protect me from immediate failure of one drive and backup protects me from failure of both drives.
04:27  sauvin: How will you be using this computer?
04:29  crocket: file server, irc bouncer, a wireless gateway, a web server, an ssh server, and etc.
04:30  crocket: It's the center of my home.
04:31  crocket: i don't know if I can make a backup of a partition on which an operating system is running.
04:31  crocket: The content of it changes gradually, and I can't make a backup of a fixed partition
04:34  crocket: sauvin : I'd solve this issue by installing two operating systems on two partitions. How would you solve this issue?
04:34  sauvin: Not sure; I'm a very casual user. I might look into a copy-on-write kind of fs.
04:35  sauvin: Thing to look at is this: how much do you really want to back up? All I ever back up before doing a re-install are /etc, /var and /home.
04:39  crocket: once a week or once every two weeks?
04:40  crocket: sauvin : Isn't RAID1 copy-on-write?
04:40  sauvin: For me, it's when I'm about to do a re-install. I tend to save stuff on external drives anyway.
04:40  sauvin: Don't know. I'm not the guy to ask about RAID.
04:41  marduk: raid1 is more overwrite-on-write
04:41  ananke: crocket: no, it's not.

05:03  xeon-enouf: crocket: raid1 won't protect you against FS corruption,(and other things that fail to come to mind atm)
05:04  xeon-enouf: oh, ...accidental rm commands ;-)
05:05  faustisch: how do I undo the following command?
05:05  faustisch: sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 127.0.0.1:7070
05:05  faustisch: will a restart suffice?
05:06  crocket: xeon-enouf, raid1 protects me against failure of one drive.
05:06  crocket: xeon-enouf, how do you protect against fs corruption?

09:17  marduk: people here seem to make mass generalizations that they can wipe their own asses with
09:17  knubbze: it's the typical mainstream-anti-mainstream borderline personalities emerging; the people who wanted to be `cool and hip and anti-mainstream ^___^' went for linux, now that lots of people use linux, they of course have an inner drive
09:17  knubbze: that makes them try to be anti-mainstream within the mainstream linux community again
09:18  sauvin: I didn't. I stated personal experience. If you want to take that as an ass-wiping generalisation, perhaps your reading comprehension needs work.
09:18  Jam3s2002: I'm not bashing ubuntu because it is "cool" or "uncool" and i'm not trashing it because I think I'm better or different than anyone. From my own hands-on experience, it is unstable and I don't like the way it does things, and I would prefer to not have to use it when I don't have to
09:18  lautriv: knubbze, no, i test it from time to time and if you see  a shiny gui-installer which is unable to get your hardware or it complains about 165 badblock on brand-new hdd's that's a reason.
09:18  grumpyrj: a lot of people try ubuntu then change to something else. Would you blame the negative PR ubu gets or actual opinion that it is not as good as others? I'm sure some go back too though.
09:18  knubbze: well, then say that
09:18 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 122 seconds
09:18  marduk: ok but your personal experience is just that.
09:19  marduk: so leave yours to yourself and let others have their own
09:19  knubbze: as I said, I don't use ubuntu; so I don't comment on how stable it actually might or might not be
09:19  knubbze: however if you say something, you should add that it is your personal opinion and not act as if you're the guru of linux distros and give a generalized statement which seems to be valid for everybody
09:19  knubbze: saying `ubuntu {rocks,rules,sucks,is shit}'
09:20  tiny: Ubuntu sucks
09:20  tiny: :D
09:20  Supergirl: Ubuntu sucks.
09:20  knubbze: I am -> offended <- and -> perplexed <- by these here statements
09:20  sauvin: Perplexed? :D
09:20  Supergirl: Perturbed?
09:20  knubbze: Perplexed? :D
09:20  Supergirl: Befuddled?
09:20  lautriv: knubbze, whenever you will google anything linux-related, you will see ubu-related bugs in the top 10.
09:21  sauvin: Probably more like simply "vexed".
09:21  Supergirl: Or appalled?
09:21  Jam3s2002: I'm going to quote myself here, so that it does go on the record that I made it known that it is my opinion
09:21  Jam3s2002: "Jam3s2002> I use it at work, but I've had enough issues with it that I don't trust it"
09:21  knubbze: lautriv: that just means that a lot of people use it
09:21  lautriv: knubbze, and there is a bug for anything in it :P
09:21  sauvin: Supergirl, do you get the impression sometimes that lots of folks have no idea what "set theory" might mean? :D
09:21  knubbze: that just means a lot of people find and fix bugs
09:22  Supergirl: And just because so many people use it, does that mean it is the best? The bar by which other distributions are measured? Does that technically make it the "Windows" of the Linux community?
09:22  Jam3s2002: nah, its the mac of the linux community
09:22  sauvin: Eek!
09:22  tiny: exacttly Supergirl, ubuntu is the "windows" of linux
09:22  knubbze: that's like saying it's the dick of the vagina community
09:22  knubbze: completely unrelated
09:22  tiny: super description
09:22  Jam3s2002: I swear to god that ubuntu isn't the windows
09:23  Jam3s2002: redhat is
09:23  tiny: haha
09:23  Supergirl: knubbze: Now wait a second, how does Ubuntu stand out from the rest of the Linux distributions? Does it do something so radically different that it suddenly sticks out like a dick?
09:24  knubbze: it was lucky, it became popular
09:24  Jam3s2002: they used to ship cds in cases of up to a thousand
09:24  Jam3s2002: for postage
09:24  sauvin: He may have been referring to ubuntu being "engorged"...
09:24 * sauvin hides
09:24  psycho_oreos: free too
09:24  Supergirl: knubbze: If you want to use an accurate analogy, why not call it the "well used" vagina of the vagina community?
09:24  Supergirl: aka: loose
09:24  Jam3s2002: the village prostitute
09:24  Supergirl: Bingo.
09:24  Jam3s2002: for a few, ubuntu has been a gateway distro
09:24  knubbze: what's wrong with Windows
09:25  marduk: sigh
09:25  sauvin: It was for me. I used to be a Fedora man before I tried ubuntu. From there I moved on to debian.
09:25  Jam3s2002: there's nothing wrong with anybody's operating system, they're all broken
09:25  Supergirl: Until they begin feeling so encumbered by the distribution itself that they try something better.
09:25  knubbze: brb wiping OpenBSD off my server and installing Windows Server 2003
09:25  psycho_oreos: there's a lot of `well used vagina' distros floating around
09:25  tiny: knubbze: noooooo!
09:26  tiny: a sinner!
09:26  sauvin: tiny, relax. He'll be in therapy in no time.
09:26 * tiny points at knubbze 
09:26  Jam3s2002: at least he'll get some kind of easy-to-use active directory support
09:26  knubbze: active directory is fun
09:26  Jam3s2002: with group policy!
09:26  knubbze: .NET is quite fun too
09:26 * lautriv facepalms
09:26  Jam3s2002: not as fun as python
09:27  knubbze: python is the loose vagina of the perl community
09:28  Jam3s2002: if you want a real freaking distro, grab a kernel, gcc, and whatever other utilities you can find, compile them all from source 5 times, manually write some intermediary code, install bash somehow, and then relize that you forgot wget, and for the time being you'ev got no way to obtain it, and then you'll understand why distros are important
09:28  Jam3s2002: <- I want some of what I'm smoking
09:29  knubbze: wget (1) is overrated
09:29  knubbze: wget (1) is the loose vagina of the netcat community
09:29  KB1JWQ: Can we drop that analogy now please?
09:30  Muimi: ohhhh
09:30  Muimi: I'm in.
09:30  knubbze: let's all just grab a kernel, a compiler and build a default userland
09:31  Muimi: Could you guys tell me if it's possible for me to install ubuntu on a mini cd and then after the installation completes go ahead and install desktop edition?
09:31  knubbze: why would that not be possible?
09:31  [R]: Muimi: you can't install to a read only medium to turn around and install more stuff onto said read only medium
09:32  knubbze: are all mini cds RO?
09:32  Muimi: What kind of answer do you guys want? :-/
09:32  Muimi: I meant to say 'can i easily' do that.
09:32  knubbze: Muimi: you are trying to install ubuntu on a writable disk (?)
09:33  Muimi: Yes.
09:33  knubbze: okay, and once you installed ubuntu on that medium, you want to install it again - only this time, to your HDD?
09:34  knubbze: if the answer to both these questions was yes; then yes it is possible
09:34  r4_: if i have calcurse launched in daemon mode...do i need to start it a particular way? i keep getting this... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/296158/
09:34  Muimi: Okay.  What command do I need to do from inside the CLI that I see after the mini install... so that I can have desktop edition...?
09:34  r4_: im starting it via ~/.xinitrc
09:34  knubbze: r4_: it says that there is already another calcurse daemon running
09:34  Muimi: or is that an option I get inside the mini cd?
09:34  Muimi: instal
09:34  Muimi: B/c with that info I can get out of everyone's hair and just do this thing.
09:34  r4_: knubbze: yeah i understand that...i launched it when i logged in
09:35  knubbze: r4_: then where is the problem
09:35  r4_: cant get the program to start
09:35  knubbze: Muimi: you are probably looking for debootstrap (8) or something similar, try the ubuntu channel mate
09:35  r4_: thats what happens when  i  try to
09:35  knubbze: r4_: are you sure it is not already running?
09:35  Muimi: Okay, I'm in ubuntu.
09:35  knubbze: Muimi: good on you; now ask there
09:36  Muimi: Okay, I did that several times.  You're here.  You should know about that...
09:36  Muimi: I trid to come here first, not second.
09:36  knubbze: what exactly are you even talking about
09:37  Muimi: #ubuntu on freenode is like #math on freenode.
09:37  knubbze: #ubuntu on freenode is like the loose vagina of freenode
09:37  Muimi: It's kind of a bad idea to send people there.
09:37  r4_: knubbze: looks like there is 2 instances of it running...im going to try something
09:37  r4_: brb
09:37  knubbze: now please describe what you are trying to do, in a comprehensible way
09:37  Muimi: I answer questions there....  Just to give you an idea.
09:37  knubbze: So you did: (a) install ubuntu on a CD, (b) <- fill in
09:38  Muimi: I'm burning a mini cd.  Turning my comptuer off.  Putting the cd in.  Installing ubuntu for dual boot.  I want to then get desktop edition, 10.10 of ubuntu 64bit
09:38  Muimi: I don't know if burning a cd is installing it or what.  When you said writeable disk, I honestly thought you meant hard disk.
09:38  knubbze: why do you not download the desktop edition then?
09:38  Muimi: Because my CD is 700 mb
09:38  [R]: Muimi: the livecd fits on regular cds
09:38  Muimi: The file isn't going to fit.
09:38  [R]: hence the name live CD
09:39  knubbze: you should use aptitude (8) and apt-cache (8) to install any package you want
09:39  Muimi: InfraRecorder won't burn the CD b/c the size.
09:39  sauvin: wtf is "infrarecorder"?
09:39  Lijnk: I did a recent username switch and whenever the terminal is turned on when logged in, the start up directory is '/home' rather than '~/'. The same thing happens when I enter my file manager.
09:39  lautriv: sauvin, probably nero for the poor on win :-)
09:39  Muimi: That's what Ubuntu.com says to use in their 'burn the cd and install ubuntu' tutorial.
09:40  [R]: Lijnk: what is a "username switch"
09:40  Lijnk: usermod -l
09:40  knubbze: Muimi: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
09:41  knubbze: the normal 64bit 10.10 disk is 644mB
09:41  [R]: Lijnk: did you do what the man page said?
09:41  knubbze: it fits on your CD, i dont get your problem
09:41  lautriv: knubbze, now you see why the ubu is popular :P
09:41  Lijnk: yes
09:41  knubbze: oh please, some years ago some people came into this channel
09:41  knubbze: and asked the exact same question
09:42  knubbze: only SuSE related
09:42  Muimi: knubbze, that doesn't work.
09:42  knubbze: why does that not work you mentally impoverished knave?
09:42  knubbze: you keep saying that you burned something on a CD; i cannot see a problem with burning another image on another CD
09:42  Muimi: As I explained: it doesn't fit onto the CD.
09:42  knubbze: you said your CD is 700mB
09:42  Muimi: Okay, listen...
09:42  Lijnk: What's odd is $HOME is set properly and when I use cd, it redirects to the proper place.
09:42  knubbze: 644mB is clearly smaller than 700mB
09:43  Muimi: This time read the whole thing...
09:43  Muimi: I burned a mini cd...
09:43  knubbze: good on ya mate
09:43  Muimi: 15 mb
09:43  knubbze: so?
09:43  Muimi: Not the one that doesn't fit on a CD.
09:43  knubbze: WHAT
09:43  knubbze: 09:38:05 < Muimi> Because my CD is 700 mb
09:43  Muimi: Now, I'm trying to install via that and then install desktop edition from the mini OS.
09:44  knubbze: then just go on and bloody DO that
09:44  grumpyrj: lol
09:44  knubbze: Muimi: I told you, read the manpages for aptitude (8) and apt-cache (8) also sources.list (5)
09:44  knubbze: and any other manpage you can find
09:44  knubbze: install the X-server, and some window manager and then you have a `DESKTOP EDITION' (sic) whatever that is supposed to be
09:45  Muimi: Thanks for the help.
09:45  Supergirl: exit
09:45  Supergirl: exit
09:45  knubbze: you are very much welcome
09:45  Muimi: Alright.  Glad to know someone knoweldgeable and experienced is trying to give me e info.
09:46  knubbze: seriously though, if you tell me that 09:38:05 < Muimi> Because my CD is 700 mb
09:46  knubbze: and then try to convince me that your 644mB ISO won't fit on it
09:46  knubbze: then you're clearly trolling
09:46  Muimi: I'm not trying to convince you.
09:46  lautriv: knubbze, that was the iso while a mini-cd holds just 225M
09:46  knubbze: he should have said `ISO' then
09:46  Muimi: You summarizing me trying to push buttons and whatever...
09:47  knubbze: Muimi: the way I see, you probably shouldn't try and push any buttons whatsoever
09:47  opalepatrick: I just want to filter out rows from a very big csv file where the value > 0 _ I am thinking gawk or awk but cant find a decent resource to do that quickly. Any ideas?
09:47  knubbze: opalepatrick: yeah, man 1 awk
09:47  Muimi: Do you have to talk to everybody?
09:47  knubbze: Muimi: yes,
09:48  knubbze: opalepatrick: you probably want the -F option in order to split fields by the CSV seperator (probably `;') in your case
09:48  lautriv: Muimi, with a debian netinst, you were already done :-)
09:49  Muimi: True, asuming I have a network.
09:49  karthee: opalepatrick: #awk
09:49 --- Termana_ is now known as Termana
09:49  Muimi: I could also install within whatever OS I'm in, assuming I don't want to boot into the OS.
09:49  opalepatrick: thanks karthee didnt realise there was one of those :-)
09:49  Muimi: Damnit... This harddrive is going to corrupt.  I'm locking up.
09:50  knubbze: Muimi: here's a suggestion: in your installed mini-os, download the desktop edition - mount the iso
09:50  knubbze: and install from there
09:50  knubbze: to complicate things further, you can try booting from a ramdisk, and afterwards use qemu (8) or some other emulator to mount the ISO
09:50  knubbze: then vnc into the qemu environment and install
09:51  sauvin: From the foks at Nike: "Just bloody DO it!"
09:51  Muimi: Why don't people play with themselves in the corner instead of right in front of me?
09:51  reisio: Muimi: agreed
09:51  lautriv: Muimi, some are bored
09:51  Muimi: have a good one.
09:51  Muimi: I gotta see why my harddrive is dying. :(
09:51  knubbze: Muimi: why do you attempt to do things that you know nothing about, and then - rather than googling or reading the manpages I gave you, squirt your lack-of-knowledge semen all over this place
09:52  Muimi: knubbze... shut up.
09:52  knubbze: no,
09:52  Muimi: Join #linuxasshole
09:52  knubbze: no,
09:52  lautriv: Muimi, side-effect of ubu, choose a proper distro then :-)
09:52  Muimi: No hard feelings.  Have a good night.
09:52  knubbze: yes,
09:52  sauvin: Muimi, knubbze, you both need to cool it.
09:52  grumpyrj: jeez guys, cut it out. You both look like children right now
09:52  knubbze: same
09:52  Muimi: Yeah well, choose a proper distro and then someone else tells you to choose a proper distro when you do that, too....

09:55  knubbze: Gryllida: make your terminal writable
09:55  sauvin: I can't remember how I installed Ubuntu, honestly. I think I fired up a LiveCD, tried it for a little while, and then found an "install me!" button.
09:55  knubbze: see chmod (1), etc.
09:55  Gryllida: sauvin: yup.
09:56  grumpyrj: Gryllida: that may also happen if you have used su to be come the user before trying to run screen
09:56  grumpyrj: *become
09:57  Gryllida: knubbze: '/dev/pts# chmod a+w 0' didn't help
09:57  knubbze: in that case he can also use chmod (1) to make the terminal writable though, can't he?
09:57  Gryllida: grumpyrj: Indeed I did.
09:57  Gryllida: "you have used su to be come the user before trying to run screen" -- right.
09:57  grumpyrj: try sshing straight in as the user and it will work.
09:57  knubbze: Gryllida: try login (1) instead of su (1)

10:11  bagira: it's starting to give me weird superstitions that i'd get with windows, like, "if i hold my lighter up at a 20 degree angle while leaning in and viewing this flash vid, firefox wont crash"
10:12  hektik: I got a nub question. I type who and it says 4 users and only shows me logged in
10:12  bagira: it's keeping me from using major services because it crashes often during important parts of sessions
10:12  bagira: it just isn't what i expect from firefox anymore.
10:12  grumpyrj: hektik: try who -a
10:12  kish: what you are about to witness is opera http://img839.imageshack.us/content_round.php?page=done&l=img839/834/screenshot1pl.png
10:13  kish: the stuff on the left are the tabs
10:13  kish: shown in a sidebar, as it should be on all browsers that dont intend to suck
10:13  kish: that is the magic of opera
10:13  hektik: grumpyrj: so im assuming if somone is running something in the background or screen it will say they are active user?
10:14  grumpyrj: yeah
10:14  Inferus: hektik: some apps run as their own user
10:14  hektik: k lol, thx
10:14  hektik: so the -a shows everything considered as a user being active then
10:14  Inferus: its so you can give application specific security rights
10:14  grumpyrj: -a is all
10:14  hektik: well -a just means active or all?
10:14  hektik: k
10:14  Inferus: unlike windows, linux is actually clever
10:14  Inferus: you don't want everything running as you
10:14  Inferus: esp if you have elevated priviledges
10:15  hektik: yea
10:15  grumpyrj: Inferus: please don't anthropomorphism OSes, they hate it when you do that
10:15  grumpyrj: anthropomorphise
10:15  grumpyrj: ah, crap
10:15  hektik: lol
10:15  Inferus: hmm?
10:15  bagira: kish, that screenshot is so small i cant tell whats going on in it.
10:15  hektik: your thesaraus program isnt working?
10:15  badcloud: kish: you're starting to rub off on me, I'm gonna give opera another try
10:15  Inferus: grumpyrj: that makes no sense
10:16  grumpyrj: linux is not clever. clever is something a person is.
10:16  kish: bagira, i had to resize it.
10:17  kish: with all the tabs visible you would ccertainly figure out who i really am
10:17  kish: damn, the text on those tabs can still be read
10:17  bagira: kish, i often question the intelligence of people I meet on IRC.
10:18  grumpyrj: yes, everyone body sucks except me. the usual thing.
10:18  grumpyrj: wow, I am a crazy sort of dyslexic tonight
10:18  DLange: everyone sucks on your body but you? Try Yoga :)
10:19 * bagira opens up a chiropractic clinic on DLange's advice
10:19  kish: yoga would break your weakened spines
10:19 * bagira pays DLange a comission
10:20  kish: so powertop breaks my usb dongled wifi
10:20 * bagira opens up a divorce-made-easy practice along the trend of thought
10:20  Inferus: grumpyrj: correct, but linux being clever is not necessarily personification, merely stating that it is cleverly developed
10:21  grumpyrj: yeah, that is reasonable.
10:21  bagira: Inferus, but...but..that didn't leave any witty self-flattering interjections at your expense!
10:21  Inferus: correct ;-)
10:21  grumpyrj: still, if you asked a windows user they would say linux is mental and the way windows is designed is clever cause they don't have to type things
10:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [##linux +o eir]
10:22 --- eir sets modes [##linux -bo *!*@hosted.by.xin.lu eir]
10:22  bagira: most windows users i know openly hate windows but dont know linux exists
10:22  grumpyrj: a lot of people would say macs are clever
10:22  grumpyrj: true
10:22  bagira: most macs users who used to be linux and windows users say they're never coming back.  most of them don't.
10:22  kish: the big screen macbook pros are hideous
10:22  lautriv: grumpyrj, they was , before apple moved to intel.
10:23  grumpyrj: heh
10:23  reisio: kish: how so?
10:23  reisio: bagira: apple whipped
10:23  kish: just look at the bezel on that keyboard
10:23  kish: apple is a junk company
10:23  kish: issuing secret code to bsd kernels
10:23  grumpyrj: I guess the statement "unlike windows, linux is actually clever" just seems a little fanboi to me.
10:23  bagira: reisio, thats nice.  can i borrow 4500 dollars so i can /part ##linux? :D
10:23  grumpyrj: Not that I disagree :-)
10:24  reisio: bagira: :p
10:24  reisio: kish: well the keyboard is awful, but
10:24  reisio: kish: you mentioned the computer
10:24  bagira: what
10:24  kish: i hear apple server administrators arent even told about the contents of security updates
10:24  reisio: which I think is merely silly expensive
10:24  bagira: apple keyboards are fantastic
10:24  reisio: bagira: no they aren't, don't be childish
10:24  bagira: what
10:24  grumpyrj: lol
10:25  reisio: a whole generation of people are going to get carpal tunnel from Apple's design moves
10:25  bagira: well that's not cool.
10:25  reisio: mark my words
10:25  reisio: in a couple years, people will be reeling over the chiclet style Apple keyboards
10:25  bagira: ive always lusted for an apple keyboard, i just think they feel better.
10:25  reisio: well your brain is broken
10:25  grumpyrj: heh
10:26  reisio: the only worse keyboard is a knockoff of them
10:26  bagira: yeah the knockoffs are terrible
10:26  bagira: have to mash in the keys and stuff
10:26  reisio: they're terrible _because_ they take Apple's design _further_
10:26  bagira: or uhm
10:26  reisio: instead of crap it's super crap
10:26  bagira: because they use inferior parts with crappy engineers who just made the outside look the same.
10:27  reisio: no because they make the keys even flatter
10:27  reisio: and the travel distance even shorter
10:27  darkferret9: hello
10:27  reisio: 'lo
10:27  darkferret9: this may seem a bit odd, but...
10:27  kish: everything about apple is shrouded in secrecy
10:27  reisio: shrouded in cardigans
10:27  bagira: well, the elephant is in the room, I may as well say it.  We're all going to get carpal tunnel.  Everyone in here.  All of us.
10:27  darkferret9: how do you do PHP shell command injection for a wargaming website?
10:28  reisio: not me
10:28  reisio: I'm invulnerable
10:28  reisio: plus I don't use crappy keyboards (for the most part)
10:28  bagira: darkferret9, by learning how php scripting is done first, then learning how ajax works, then studying how the already existing various injection methods were discovered, and then replicating.
10:29  darkferret9: err...how the heck do you even learn the first one?
10:29  bagira: darkferret9, by googling.
10:29  bagira: darkferret9, but first, how old are you?
10:29  darkferret9: 17
10:29  sedulous: darkferret9: there are like, dead trees pressed into sheets, with letters on them, bound to "books"
10:30  grumpyrj: save the trees for heaven's sake.
10:30  darkferret9: lol...papers with letters on them, bound into a book
10:30  darkferret9: bagira: why do you ask?
10:30  bagira: darkferret9, abandon your career as a hacker.  they don't exist, anymore.  the ones that do aren't cool anymore.  and, if you did become good at it, you'd eventually realize that you weren't really 'hacking' you were just running someone else's script.
10:30  sedulous: i've heard they have dead trees thingies about PHP too ;)
10:30  darkferret9: bagira: hell no
10:31  bagira: darkferret9, now, a hacker is someone who edits httpd.conf to tweak their apache installation.
10:31  darkferret9: damnit!
10:31  darkferret9: NOOOOOOOO!
10:31  darkferret9: I want to be cool!
10:31  sedulous: PHP is not a good language to learn programming with
10:32  bagira: good.  then stop asking how to 'be a leet haxxor' in IRC channels and study something that actually ends in a tangible skill.
10:32  darkferret9: err...like what?
10:32  archeleus: C++
10:32  darkferret9: C, Java?
10:32  darkferret9: hell no
10:32  sedulous: LISP, start with LISP.
10:32  sedulous: or Haskell.
10:32  bagira: darkferret9, databases design concepts are a good start.  branch from there.
10:32  darkferret9: no C++, at least not from the start
10:32  darkferret9: bagira: why?
10:32  grumpyrj: hacking or cracking can be a good way to learn. do whatever interestes you to learn. but beware the dark side of cracking
10:32  archeleus: darkferret9: why no C++?
10:32  bagira: darkferret9, because it's a SKILL
10:32  darkferret9: I thought people learned a programming language first
10:33  darkferret9: bagira: a programming language is a skill
10:33  mintux: I have problem with file system in ext4 partition I have 14 gig free but only 4 gig available but in fat I have 32 gig free I have 32gig available why ?  http://up.iranblog.com/Files0/f703f3d304234eae9445.png
10:33  bagira: darkferret9, no, a programming language is an angry prison.
10:33  darkferret9: grrr...
10:33  darkferret9: why?
10:34  bagira: If I told you, "they" would "remove" me.
10:34  darkferret9: people in CS courses learn programming along with algorithm development techniques, and they learn how algorithms work
10:34  kish: i often wonder myself about the intelligence of irc people
10:34  darkferret9: bagira: just tell me in a private message
10:34  sedulous: archeleus: C++ is unnecessarily complex for beginners and they'll spend more time learning the language instead of concepts, data structures and algorithms. The syntax of LISP/Scheme however can be described on 1-2 pages and it's all about algorithms from that point on.
10:34  darkferret9: ohh...really sedulous ?
10:34  darkferret9: which one, LISP or Scheme?
10:35  sedulous: Scheme
10:35  sedulous: it's a modern LISP dialect
10:35  kish: all coding is too complicated
10:35  darkferret9: why, exactly?
10:35  tiny: mintux: man mkfs.ext3 ( -m reserved-blocks-percentage )
10:35  kish: programming is best done inside a gui with your mouse
10:35  grumpyrj: kish: huh?
10:35  grumpyrj: oh god no
10:35  sedulous: darkferret9: because Scheme lets you focus on logic & concepts instead of syntax
10:35  darkferret9: tiny: can't you change it with a tune2fs?
10:35  homie: not true not true
10:35  homie: all oversimplified
10:35  sedulous: compared to C++ at least
10:36  tiny: darkferret9: yes
10:36  archeleus: I know Scheme
10:36  bagira: darkferret9, nah i dont really care that much.  but really, i'd start with C and move on to C++ if you were REALLY SERIOUS; if not, I'd learn PERL, PHP, MySQL etc; but you probably really would be better off learning systems administration, some database design, learn your office apps, take some public speaking courses, get your EE stuff figured out, and beef your math skills up.
10:36  archeleus: good for learning concepts
10:36  archeleus: but weird syntax
10:36  archeleus: really really weird
10:36  sedulous: it's as elegant is it could get
10:37  kish: what if the logic in scheme is too complicated
10:37  bagira: also ignore anything related to LISP, SCHEME, PASCAL, or FORTRAN
10:37  kish: i hate syntax
10:37  darkferret9: bagira: heheh...why?
10:37  kish: and all those symbols you have to memorize
10:37  bagira: darkferret9, because 10 years from now, everyone else will.
10:37  darkferret9: bagira: not enough api libraries?
10:37  kish: and im pretty good at languages, spoken ones
10:37  grumpyrj: kish you must be joking right?
10:37  archeleus: after using quite a lot of  languages I must say that I still prefer C
10:38  kish: ½joking
10:38  sedulous: What's the point of learning about pointers, object orientation, polymorphism, etc.. when you haven't even grasped recursion and lambdas properly yet?
10:38  darkferret9: iterative while and for loops can be converted into recursive functions, I know that much
10:39  koala_man: I have a bridge configured on two interfaces. what do I have to do to get packets from one interface to be sent on the other?
10:39  bagira: darkferret9, well i guess pascal could be an exception, it's way outdated but it really is a good language to learn the basics on.
10:39  archeleus: scheme is the best for recursion and lambdas
10:39  kish: scheme could have a simpler syntax...
10:39  lautriv: koala_man, how is the bridge set up ?
10:39  sedulous: alternatively to the rather mathematical scheme, I'd recommend starting at a low level like C or Assembler. just don't start with a scripting language or a "modern" OO language like C#, Java or C++, imho.
10:40  bagira: yeah but
10:40  kish: sedulous, what happens if you do
10:40  bagira: who wants to be a programmer?
10:40  grumpyrj: even if you don't do it for a job it's still bloody handy
10:40  grumpyrj: who wants to just blindly follow what other people do for them.
10:40  kish: is there a syntax suited for tiny keyboards with lots of shift work
10:41  mordocai: bagira: Well, i'm going /away so I can't discuss, but I want to be a programmer :P. Going to school for it now.
10:41  archeleus: Scheme : if you want to be a computer scientist
10:41  koala_man: lautriv: brctl addbr br0; brctl addif eth0; brctl addif wlan0; dhclient br0
10:41  bagira: the only people who want to be programmers are non-programmers or very very rich successful programmers, and even alot of the latter still wouldn't if they went back.
10:41  koala_man: lautriv: it now has an ip, and can ping boxes on both sides. but the sides can't ping each other
10:42  grumpyrj: bollocks.
10:42  grumpyrj: 'scuse
10:42  grumpyrj: bagira: you're either dim or trolling now
10:42  bagira: what
10:42  bagira: dude.
10:42  mastertheknife: sedulous: Indeed, C is a good starting point and can accomplish most programming tasks easily
10:42  bagira: C/C++ rots your brain out.  Ask anyone who HAS to use it for their job.
10:43  bagira: It makes you crazy.
10:43  kish: yeah the kernel guys are nuts
10:43  grumpyrj: clearly you've worked with it a while then :-/
10:43  bagira: it even screws up your spoken and written language
10:44  archeleus: ^ amen
10:44  koala_man: haha what? since when could C accomplish anything easily
10:44  lautriv: koala_man, 99% of wlans can't bridge because the implementation, if your's is able to do so, set the IP to the interfaces instead the br0 b/c bridge acts on MAC .
10:44  mastertheknife: koala_man: small\medium size projects
10:44  sedulous: mastertheknife: Either C / ASM or a functional language are good starts, imho
10:44  mastertheknife: with bigger projects, OOP definitely has its plac
10:44  kish: what about a binary language
10:45  metbsd: i prefer ascii language, easier to read
10:45  koala_man: lautriv: oh, damn.
10:45  mastertheknife: well its just like with life.. every tool for its job, lol
10:45  sedulous: mastertheknife: yeah but OOP is superfluous for beginners. they don't have huge projects yet.
10:45  kish: knife work
10:45  bagira: i'd much rather be the guy walking into the dimly lit office full of neurotic C programmers and pouring cold water on them and telling them to make me more money.
10:45  kish: the question is rather, what is a good first project
10:45  lautriv: koala_man, will you create some AP/router ?
10:46  kish: certainly not the examples you see online
10:46  AssociateX: beep beep
10:46  Rickardo1: I am using keys to connect to my server,  in ~/.ssh/ i got id_rsa.pub that contain the key.. but if I want more keys to different servers?
10:47  darkferret9: it is time for me to recompile my kernel and a whole hell of a lot of xorg crap
10:47  koala_man: lautriv: I have two boxes with gig-e between them, and one wlan device. I'd like them both to use it, and I wanted them both to be on the same network with the rest of my devices
10:47  darkferret9: I am so pissed
10:47  mastertheknife: sedulous: exactly! and OOP can actually complicate things, such as linkage or replacing the program's libraries. with C, a library is not binary compatible anymore if a symbol is missing or function parameters changed, etc, but with OOP even the smallest change in the classes (function virtuals, etc) can break the compatibility between the library and the program
10:47  darkferret9: something is broken
10:47  darkferret9: I'll brb...
10:48  koala_man: mastertheknife: you mean "but with C++". this is not a feature inherent in OOP
10:49  mastertheknife: yes, i used C++ for this one example how OOP can actually complicate things
10:49  sedulous: mastertheknife: it's painful to see how some CS courses start with Java nowadays. they're just learning what variables, functions, call by reference/value is, arrays, simple algorithms, .... classes are completely unnecessary fluff there
10:49  lautriv: koala_man, iirc only atheros is capable to bridge, otherwise you could setup the wlan with iptables masquerade.
10:50  sedulous: OO has it's place after you're confident with either functional or imperative programming
10:50  koala_man: blerk, masquerade
10:50  bagira: sedulous, thats because the previous generation of CS majors were part of that big boom, and everyone rushed through thinking they had stuff figured out, and got half the credentials they really needed.  now we're paying for it.
10:51  bagira: who do you think is teaching them and designing these curriculums?
10:51  mastertheknife: sedulous: yeah, instead of teaching C and explaining a little what happens behind the scenes, they just teach you java and teach you how wonderful OOP is
10:51  grumpyrj: although I'm not a java fan, it's not a bad place to start really.
10:52  reisio: grumpyrj: shut yo mouth!
10:52  grumpyrj: anyone serious will get past the high level stuff and do it for real.
10:52  grumpyrj: heh
10:53  archeleus: I feel like quiting the moment I have to type "System.out.printf"
10:53  sedulous: mastertheknife: yeah and then you start to wonder how these references work... "what's a pointer?"
10:53  koala_man: people who code OOP well will in 90% of cases write better software than people who don't but can tell you how stack frames are laid out
10:53  bagira: sedulous, in two generations of cs majors that will no longer be in the terminology
10:54  reisio: grumpyrj: ...which would make all their time spent on Java™ a waste
10:54  grumpyrj: not really, it's not a bad place to learn some basic concepts
10:54  archeleus: Depends on what you want to do in the end I guess
10:54  archeleus: Raw speed: C
10:54  grumpyrj: You wouldn't want to all that far past "hello world" though :-)
10:54  archeleus: Socket programming etc: Python/other similar
10:55  archeleus: OOP: C++/Java
10:55  grumpyrj: microcontrollers: C
10:55  sedulous: bagira: who's going to write the next generation compilers then? :(
10:56  sedulous: koala_man: people who code OOP wouldn't be able to do so without someone who knows how stack frames are laid out and writes compilers or virtual machines tho :P
10:56  bagira: sedulous, a small group of lonely men at an elite college that will become the source of all microcomputing knowledge.
10:56  sedulous: also, one doesn't exclude the other
10:56  mastertheknife: I think CS should focus on what it is, computer science, and teach C including a little about whats happening behind scenes, for example, whats a stack, explaining whats program's virtual address space, the heap, etc
10:57  archeleus: If you are going to focus _only_ on computer science (as in complexity etc) then you gotta do scheme
10:57  koala_man: sedulous: well, no. and people who can write compilers or virtual machines wouldn't be able to do so without someone refining silicon. but of course that doesn't make miners the ultimate compsci people
10:57  sedulous: good point, koala_man ,)
10:57  bagira: scheme is something i just rinsed out with a gallon or so of water and had to pull on the rubber thing on the back to get to go down.
10:58  Diverdude: Does anybody know a good tuner card which supports at least following specifications. Dual Tuner (More of couse is better), Supports DVB-C/DVB-T, MPEG 2 and 4, and runs under linux?
10:58  sedulous: koala_man: my only opinion was that OOP isn't necessarily a good _start_, not that it's bad generally, far from it
10:59  sedulous: also bad OO programmers are just as numerous as bad low level coders
10:59  koala_man: much more numerous
11:00  lautriv: Diverdude, have a look at hauppauge
11:00  koala_man: or, well. depends what you mean by low level coders. there are those who write C in java, using arrays instead of collections and such
11:04  lautriv: koala_man, already tested the IP change ?
11:05  koala_man: lautriv: I should set the same ip on each of the interfaces and remove it from br0, and because there's a bridge between them, it'll magically work?
11:08  SixThreeOh: What a partition puts its self into read only because of some error (presumably hdd damage), and syslog/dmesg don't show the incident (mount also shows it as still rw), is there anywhere else that I might be able to find more info on the error?
11:09  lautriv: koala_man, no, from the standpoint of your transport, the IP is the "target", if you e.g. give eth0 10.0.0.2 and wlan 10.0.0.3 you have a defined route, where your other side of the wlan can talk to as "gateway" .
11:09  tiny: koala_man: why do you need to bridging in the first place?
11:09  tiny: -to
11:09  tiny: solve it in layer 3
11:10  tiny: and make sure you turn on ip forwarding
11:11  koala_man: I guess I could. will that work well with dhcp?
11:11  tiny: I don't see why not
11:12  SixThreeOh: The partition is /var, so I guess that means I wont have any logs.... is there some other way to probe the mount point to find a more specific error than that it is read only?
11:13  lautriv: koala_man, ,tiny nah, there is one problem then, dhcp is broadcasting  and he won't get through the machine without a global forward.
11:14  lautriv: koala_man, with your first bridge, was you able to ping behind the machine with both interfaces ?
11:15  koala_man: eh?
11:16  lautriv: koala_man, like that --> eth0+wlan0 is on br0.....could you ping the machine or router behind eth0 from the wlan side ?
11:17  koala_man: the topology is A--B--C. B could ping A and C, but A could not ping C
11:19  lautriv: koala_man, test if you can do so if you dhcp on eth0 && wlan0 instead br0
11:19  koala_man: there is no dhcp server on eth0, only on wlan0
11:19  bagira: lautriv, he'll have to call flynn, his user.
11:20  lautriv: koala_man, yes but eth0 is on the bridge, thus the MAC is glued
11:20  bagira: haha.  sorry.  im way too tired to be on IRC.  night folks.
11:21  Miesco: Is there any way to sort the list you get from du
11:21  Miesco: I tried: du | sort, but no
11:21  koala_man: lautriv: it's not getting a response
11:22  Cmdr_W_T_Riker: Miesco: try du | sort -n
11:22  lautriv: koala_man, this is not because your logic but the problem on bridges on wlan, need to NAT/forward then.
11:23  koala_man: damn
11:23  koala_man: well, thanks
11:24  lautriv: anytime
11:27  _abc_: So anyone here who can explain ALSA bindings?
11:27  pietia: is it possible to set ssh public key per address not only per domain ?
11:28  pietia: i mean , in ~/.ssh/config
11:30  bagira: pietia, you can tell ssh to use a keyfile in the command
11:31  extor: This is odd. I typed "mii-tool -F" and it gave me the syntax for 10mbit and 100mbit but 1000mbit was missing.
11:31  bagira: extor, is support for your 1000mbit built into your kernel?
11:32  extor: bagira, I have centos 5.5 so I would hope so!
11:32  lautriv: extor, mii is deprecated and unusual for 1000Tx
11:33  tiny: lautriv: let me get this .... You have a box with wlan and wired interface connected to another box with wired interface like this [ W, E ] ---- [ E ]  and W interface get's its IP from DHCP. Why can't W be default gw?
11:33  extor: lautriv, so how on earth would I negotiate a gbit connection then?
11:33 * extor decides to hit google
11:35  lautriv: tiny, there is nothing wrong with this, maybe you misunderstood me somehow ?
11:35  tiny: maybe :)
11:35  lautriv: tiny, do you refer to koalas prob ?
11:35  tiny: yes
11:37  lautriv: tiny, his problem was simply, dhcp is on W while the same E was bridged to W but most wlan can't brifge by implementation and so he failed to glue them together.
11:38  tiny: lautriv: yes and I understand that. I also asked why stick it in bridge in the first place. I'm guessing he needs to "see" stuff over W interface.
11:39  pietia: bagira, i cant. cruisecontrol uses ~/.ssh/config
11:39  tiny: If he can't set E1, E2, E3 to be on the same network segment then he should set E1 as default gw for E network and place routes on box1 so traffic goes trough W
11:40  bagira: then stop using cruisecontrol
11:40  tiny: *on the same net segment as W (dhcp)
11:41  lautriv: tiny, he would be on the same subnet with both instead translate.
11:42  bagira: why don't you just have W as a separate interface and have a proxy server listen at it's IP, have the wired network use it as a proxy?
11:43  lautriv: extor, sorry for delay, recent distros are supposed to have ethtool instead.
11:45  extor: So it does. And ethtool is a bit intimidating, approximately 5 times larger syntax for one.
11:45  lautriv: bagira, because the overhead.
11:46  bagira: would that really be an issue on a one-person network?
11:46  bagira: bottleneck is still at the modem.
11:47  tiny: I would solve it like this: GW box has two subnets W, E and IP forwarding turned on with W being default gw  [W, E1] ----- [E Subnet]  E subnet has E1 as default gw.
11:47  tiny: lautriv, koala_man ^
11:47  lautriv: bagira, a.) who said there is only one b.) never waste resources if you can avoid it
11:48  lautriv: tiny, this is what is said formerly and seems to be neccessary.
11:48  tiny: lautriv: yes but there's no masquerading needed, just proper routing
11:51  lautriv: tiny, you won't get a gateway within the same subnet.
12:00  RenatoSilva: why is it when I have umask 0077 some process creates files with some other mask?
12:02  RenatoSilva: RenatoSilva: because the process is running under another user
12:02  lautriv: huh ?
12:05  guampa: talk about split personality
12:05  kwork: lol
12:15  n8w: hey
12:19  n8w: how can i prevent having to do the followin every time i switch to different user: export DISPLAY=:0.0  ,  export $(dbus-launch)??
12:19  guampa: n8w: put those lines in you .profile
12:19  n8w: guampa:  ok,thx i will look at it...
12:19  karthick87: What is the difference between initrd and initramfs?
12:19  PingFloyd: initramfs pretty much replaced initrd
12:21  dalela: Hi
12:22  dalela: I have a project which is stored local on my computer (I develop local), and when I'm ready I sync this dir with my server, log into the server and move the uploaded to the path where the webserver can access it and at least - reload the webserver
12:22  dalela: Someone told me it is better to use a subversion system for this
12:23  dalela: How should I realise this now? Should I create a repository on my server and upload to and from it ? If yes, how can I do this from an existing directory?
12:24  koala_man: karthick87: initrd was block device based, initramfs is file based
12:25  karthick87: koala_man: Pls explain me little bit more
12:26  Cmdr_W_T_Riker: karthick87: what does pls mean
12:27  koala_man: karthick87: with initrd, you created a file system image. with initramfs, you create an archive with the files which the kernel extracts to a tmpfs
12:29  karthick87: koala_man: thank you :)
12:32  karthick87: koala_man: What abt the disk size?
12:33  koala_man: karthick87: what about what?
12:34  karthick87: koala_man: I mean the disk created by initrd.
12:35  koala_man: the initrd will most likely be bigger, but I don't know by how much
12:38  karthick87: koala_man: I heard that  Initrd requires at least one file system driver be compiled into the kernel..Is it so?
12:40  koala_man: karthick87: yes
12:41  karthick87: hmm oje
12:41  karthick87: * oke
12:43  _abc_: what magic does one use to make applications see the virtual devices defined in ~/.asoundrc ?
12:43  Harold_parker: what the cunt?
12:43  Harold_parker: http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/06/21/1928220/VLC-11-Forced-To-Drop-Shoutcast-Due-To-AOL-Anti-OSS-Provision?from=rss
12:43  _abc_: I can use them fine from the cli but things like xmms do not honor them
12:43  Harold_parker: god damn aol at again
12:44  Harold_parker: apparently this is old news but i don't care i'm still mad
12:44  karthick87: Will the deleted browser history be stored in File-system?
12:50  rindolf: Hi all. How can I run x86-64 VirtualBox guests on Mandriva 2010.1? I have virtualbox-3.2.10-1mdv2010.1 and when I try to boot a CD of Mandriva 2010.1 x86-64 I'm getting a "This machine is 32-bit" error at the start.
12:51  reisio: rindolf: what processor?
12:51  rindolf: reisio: x86-64 .
12:51  reisio: rindolf: specifically
12:51  rindolf: reisio: model name      : Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU       T4300  @ 2.10GHz
12:52  reisio: you'll have to use vmware or qemu
12:52  rindolf: reisio: hmmm... why?
12:52  reisio: VirtualBox needs a processor with virtualization support for what you want
12:53  reisio: so does kvm
12:53  reisio: I wouldn't bother with vmware or qemu, though, just use a 32-bit version
12:53  rindolf: reisio: 32-bit version?
12:54  rindolf: I'm trying to test something on Cooker x64.
12:54  reisio: test what?
12:54  rindolf: So I need an x64 guest.
12:54  rindolf: reisio: a bug.
12:54  rindolf: reisio: in Cooker.
12:54  reisio: well, you can repartition and do a physical install
12:54  reisio: or use vmware
12:55  reisio: or use qemu
12:55  rindolf: OK.
12:55  reisio: I guess technically you could also do a fany partition-in-a-file... inside one of your existing filesystems, too
12:56  rindolf: reisio: like chroot?
12:57  hariom: I want to see the cron log file to note if my application is performing anything wrong. I see that my application runs under the cron job defined but the desired outcome is not generated (i.e. updating data in a file). When I run same command, I can see the desired outcome. How to setup cron log or if exists, where to find one? I don't see it in /var/logs.
12:57  hariom: I am on ubuntu 10.04
12:57  reisio: rindolf: not sure, doubt it
12:58  reisio: hariom: what's the command?
12:59  PingFloyd: rindolf: you need a cpu with vt-x or amdv extension in order to run a 64-bit guest on virtualbox
13:00  rindolf: PingFloyd: sucks.
13:00  rindolf: Why don't I need these funny extensions with VirtualBox on i386?
13:05  _abc_: I am going insane over ALSA
13:06  _abc_: how do i make other devices recognize virtual devices created in ~/.asoundrc
13:06  _abc_: they can only see hw devices
13:06  _abc_: mplayer works with the virtuals fine
13:07  hariom: reisio: Executing a python script. /usr/bin/python /home/hariom/scripts/python1.py
13:07  sedulous: _abc_: have you tried turning it off and on again?
13:07  hariom: reisio: How can I see the log output? If the script throws any error, I want to see that
13:08  sedulous: _abc_: (i'm kidding, sorry :P)
13:08  rindolf: reisio: thanks.
13:08  _abc_: sedulous: you mean rebooting it >:~
13:09 * _abc_ thwaps sedulous with a giant windows XP box
13:09  sedulous: _abc_: it works for windows admins!
13:09  sedulous: hehe
13:09  _abc_: does it help to put the ~/.asoundrc in a more central location? like /etc/alsa/... ?
13:10  reisio: hariom: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html
13:10  sedulous: _abc_: either ~/.asoundrc or /etc/asound.conf (consistency FTW)
13:10  SkunkyFone: _abc_: some programs don't know how to talk to anything but the hw devices....
13:10  _abc_: sedulous: I know but has anyone done this?
13:11  sedulous: _abc_: well, I use a system-wide /etc/asound.conf with a "virtual" dmix device
13:11  _abc_: SkunkyFone: alsa devices are not 'hw' at all
13:11  _abc_: sedulous: ah so you can just add stuff there?
13:11  _abc_: sedulous: do you also have a sequencer channel in there?
13:11  _abc_: I don't know how to route midi output
13:11  sedulous: _abc_: my /etc/asound.conf: http://paste.debian.net/100807/
13:11  sedulous: no, just 1 PCM dmix
13:11  _abc_: thx
13:12  sedulous: works for me
13:12  _abc_: oh the hint is important. My stuff does not accept that
13:12  _abc_: what version are you on?
13:12  _abc_: i mean the hint section
13:12  _abc_: sedulous: what version?
13:12  sedulous: _abc_: kernel 2.6.37-rc3, alsa "1.0.23+dfsg-2" (debian)
13:12  sedulous: if you mean that
13:13  _abc_: yes
13:13  _abc_: thanks
13:13  _abc_: I need to get the new libs I think
13:13  _abc_: This may cause breakage
13:13  PingFloyd: I'm surprised you have to even mess with asound.conf to get dmix working these days
13:14  _abc_: I'm not about dmix, I wanted to dupe the output into 2 sound cards
13:14  PingFloyd: for most hardware, you don't have to do that in more recent versions of alsa
13:14  _abc_: I succeeded but I seem to need a new version so the virtual device shows as an option
13:14  _abc_: I can't use the hint { ... } part
13:14  hariom: reisio: I didn't get what do you want to say by this?
13:15  hariom: reisio: I see that the script remove some content from the file. Saves it but doesn't add in it. Where as if I run the command from commandline, I can see data getting added into the file.
13:15  sedulous: PingFloyd: yeah, i was surprised to but it fixed my pulseaudio issue
13:15  sedulous: *too
13:16  sedulous: for whatever reason
13:16  _abc_: Some docs refer to ALSA as 'job security' for whoever wrote it
13:16  _abc_: I tend to agree
13:17  sveajobb: Hi guys. Modifying flash-banners in linux? any pointers.. all I want to do is change _root.clickTag to _root.clicktag in the actionscript
13:17  PingFloyd: sedulous: that's pretty common when you introduce a sound server like that
13:18  PingFloyd: sedulous: it's usually less trouble to either do mixing with alsa, or the sound server instead of trying to get mixing working in both
13:18  sedulous: PingFloyd: i wish every mainboard & notebook would just have emu10k1 onboard sound
13:18  sedulous: you can throw anything at that, even OSS3, and it plays
13:18  PingFloyd: sedulous: that's kind of the name of the game with sound in linux though--different projects having their own ideas
13:19  sedulous: yeah
13:19  PingFloyd: sedulous: here's a pretty good article that explains the dilemma http://www.tuxradar.com/content/how-it-works-linux-audio-explained
13:20  hariom: How to setup cron log file? I am on ubuntu 10.04
13:20  PingFloyd: if all the sound related project would at least get on the same page, we wouldn't have these problems
13:22  PingFloyd: the problem is you have some overlap on what handles what
13:41  lautriv: *wave*
13:42  _abc_: can someone tell me in what alsa version the hint { show on; name "foo"; } appeared?
13:42  _abc_: can someone tell me in what alsa version the 'hint { show on; name "foo"; }' appeared?
13:42  _abc_: I mean the syntax for that
13:42  _abc_: Mine does not like that
13:43  lautriv: _abc_, where is it supposed to appear ?
13:44  _abc_: lautriv: in alsa.conf or asoundrc, in any section
13:44  _abc_: lautriv: it basically exports that definition as a top level device
13:44  gordboy: _abc_: maybe ask in #alsa. but i've never gotten any sense out of them for many, many years ...
13:44  _abc_: lautriv: search here for 'hint' http://alsa.opensrc.org/.asoundrc
13:49  tobi1canobe: ow come my cdrom /dev/hda is 600, when 50-udev says SUBSYSTEM=="block",             GROUP="disk", MODE="0640" ?
13:50  badcloud: is there a lightweight flash plugin like flvideoreplacer-extension.blogspot.com for opera?
13:52  karthick87: Can anyone explain me the steps from the start to the loading and reading of initramfs?
13:53  gordboy: tobi1canobe: maybe you have another rule somewhere that countermands that
13:54  tobi1canobe: counterminds ?
13:54  tobi1canobe: nevermind I get it
13:54  n13z_: karthick87: take a look to wikipedia article about initrd
13:55  tobi1canobe: gordboy, the only other in /etc/udev/rules.d with 600 is the first one in 50-tules  (default): KERNEL=="*", OWNER="root" GROUP="root", MODE="0600"
13:59  gordboy: tobi1canobe: i thought optical drive entries in /dev were owned by group cdrom anyways
14:00  tobi1canobe: ugh now this is funny: hda is owned by antadm
14:00  tobi1canobe: some random luser
14:00  gordboy: you have made a mess of things by the looks of it
14:00  tobi1canobe: aha, maybe consolekit
14:01  tobi1canobe: gordboy, I be he is logged in at the console !
14:01  tobi1canobe: antadm   :0           2010-11-03 10:25
14:01  tobi1canobe: that's it
14:01  tobi1canobe: has been for a month too!
14:02  mrcarrot: tobi1canobe: what distro are you using?
14:02  karthick87: What is the minimum size of the LAMP server?
14:02  tobi1canobe: mrcarrot, centos
14:03  tobi1canobe: mrcarrot, no actually this one is official redhat. rhap actually
14:03  tobi1canobe: some people like to pay :)
14:03  jimbauwens: Can anyone try this : open firefox and enter a url like this longheader:// were longheader is a word longer than 215 character. On my computer compiz crashes. Could anyone try and see if it works with you?
14:03  jimbauwens: If compiz crashe
14:03  jimbauwens: crashes*
14:05  mrcarrot: karthick87: is the size really an issue? i mean, you can get almost any linux distro and any bsd installed without X... but they still tend to be quite big. if you install some custom stuff you have more difficult with support
14:06  karthick87: mrcarrot: I installed LAMP+OpenSSH. It is about 1.1GB,can I reduce the total size of the server?
14:06  mrcarrot: karthick87: what distro?
14:06  karthick87: ubuntu
14:07  mrcarrot: karthick87: ubuntu installes a lot of stuff that it is considering to belong to the base... by taking away manually packages you get it down more...
14:07  mrcarrot: karthick87: but do you really have to little space left on your hd?
14:08  karthick87: yes i have
14:09  jimbauwens: Can't you install apache/mysql/php in tinycore linux?
14:09  jimbauwens: I think its in the repos
14:09  jimbauwens: *I think*
14:10  wito: So, I work in a small IT company, we work mostly with web stuff.
14:11  wito: But a couple of our coders insist on never configuring their text editors correctly; so some of our source repos are rife with files full of tabs, missing newlines at the end, trailing whitespace, etc.
14:11  wito: Does anyone know of a tool that'll find files with these problems so I can portion out a heap for git blame?
14:12  mrcarrot: karthick87: i have been getting slackware to fit on a 256Mb usb stick... i bet it can be done with ubuntu too. just a lot of time to do a such thing
14:12  mrcarrot: oh, it was 128... now i remember
14:12  mrcarrot: 128Mb
14:12  jimbauwens: no, 128k :p
14:12  marduk: wito: get one of the coders to write one
14:12  karthick87: mrcarrot: Wov :)
14:12  mrcarrot: it was a few years ago...
14:13  karthick87: mrcarrot: How you reduced the size?
14:13  mrcarrot: i have many times been making custom distros out of slackware... i carefully select exactly the packages i need, then from them i remove stuff that is not needed for this application
14:13  mrcarrot: like documentation, headers and a lot of other stuff
14:14  mrcarrot: but like that you get a "broken" distro and if something is not working you are on your own
14:15  karthick87: hmmm
14:15  jimbauwens: karthick87, http://bitnami.org/stack/lampstack
14:15  marduk: i do that with gentoo but they're virtual appliances
14:16  marduk: basically like ubuntu jeos
14:16  wito: marduk: Know of anything a little more ready-made?
14:17  jimbauwens: karthick87, lampstack+tinycore linux = winner
14:17  marduk: wito: no
14:17  wito: Ok, well
14:17  wito: thanks anyway
14:17  marduk: you could probably script something or right a sed/awk script or something
14:18  wito: yeah; just wanted to know if something existed before pouring a couple of hours into it.
14:18  marduk: it's like 2 minutes
14:18  badcloud: is there a lightweight flash plugin like flvideoreplacer-extension.blogspot.com for opera? sorry for repost, bad connection
14:18  marduk: open file, seek to end. read last byte
14:19  crocket: The components of my server computer were delivered today.
14:19  crocket: I tried to assemble it, but something broke because of weakness. I have to get a replacement for that part tomorrow.
14:19  crocket: I don't know if they will give the replacement for free.
14:20  _abc_: can someone look in their alsa configs for a section called hint { } ?
14:20  _abc_: I'm trying to understand what supports it and what does not
14:21  wito: marduk: I'll think of something.
14:21  wito: Thanks again
14:23  comawhite: wow Novell goes bye bye
14:24  SkunkyFone: comawhite: a few days late.
14:24  comawhite: i know
14:27  karthick87: mrcarrot: can i remove some unnecessary library's
14:28  mrcarrot: karthick87: sure, as long as you know what you do...
14:29  mrcarrot: karthick87: you need to check what program depends on them... and if you need those programs. if you have a library in ubuntu, it is because of a dependency
14:39  karthick87: mrcarrot: Thanks a lot :)
14:40  tobi1canobe: found it: /etc/security/console.perms.d

14:51  Psi-Jack: Epic Mega Split
14:53  Mikoman: quick question. How is the hardware raid controller checking the health of the array? it does some internal test or during the reading operation?
14:58  Psi-Jack: Mikoman: For example, SATA RAID controlers talk to SMART, also it knows what's being writen, and what's failing by that, too.
14:58  Mikoman: realy? no one can answer my question?
14:58  Mikoman: ah ty

15:12  sedulous: kernel.org is down
15:12 * sedulous is a sad panda
15:12  gordboy: http://www.kernel.org/ works for me
15:13  FieldySnuts: works here. try http://www2.kernel.org/
15:13  mastertheknife: sedulous: not here
15:13 --- FieldySnuts is now known as Fieldy
15:13  sedulous: oh. i got no route from here. other servers work tho.
15:13  gordboy: sedulous: are you sure you typed in the right url ?
15:13  gordboy: :)
15:13  sedulous: yes, and i did a traceroute
15:14  RenatoSilva: how to grep next matching line? i.e. grep -A 1 regex | grep something_in_A_1
15:14  gordboy: is there any display on the monitor ?
15:14  Fieldy: -A 2
15:15  RenatoSilva: Fieldy: you misunderstood
15:16  ManDay: Does anyone own a LOGITECH FORCE 3D PRO Joystick?
15:17  jellow: I'm using rtorrent+screen on a vps , However i can't access many of the main trackers , How can i check if they have been blocked?
15:18  marduk: sigh
15:18  Psi-Jack: Sigh, is right.
15:19  jellow: is a sigh really needed?
15:19  marduk: no. it's optional
15:19  Fieldy: if the trackers use tcp in any way, use tcptraceroute against them, you may be able to see how far the connection gets
15:19  Fieldy: otherwise, no idea
15:19  Fieldy: many commercial cable providers block them however
15:20  Psi-Jack: I question people running torrents on a VPS.
15:20  Fieldy: warez kiddies! nevar!
15:20  marduk: some hosting companies block that stuff.. liability and all
15:23  sedulous: got a route to kernel.org again
15:23  sedulous: it seems didn't get past 10gigabitethernet1-2.core1.chi1.he.net earlier
15:24  ManDay: Does anyone own a LOGITECH FORCE 3D PRO Joystick?
15:24  Psi-Jack: ManDay: You've already asked that.
15:24  mreh: why does vi place a newline at the end of my file
15:25  ManDay: Psi-Jack: sorry, have a short memory
15:25  Psi-Jack: mreh: It doesn't. You do.
15:25  mreh: when I cat a line onto is it places it there
15:25  ManDay: (so does irc)
15:25  ManDay: ;p
15:25  Psi-Jack: ManDay: I have an itchy trigger finger, too.
15:25  mreh: Psi-Jack, are you sure?
15:25  ManDay: Psi-Jack: then take it of your trigger.
15:26  Psi-Jack: mreh: Yep
15:27  mreh: Psi-Jack: what makes you so sure?
15:27  mreh: sure it isn't cat?
15:27  mreh: or appending it
15:27  mreh: experiment time
15:28  Psi-Jack: vi doesn't add anything extra. nano does, vi doesn't.
15:28  Fieldy: die die die nano
15:28  Psi-Jack: Inserting nano probes into Fieldy..... Success.. You are now, assimilated!
15:29  Fieldy: :/
15:29  mreh: nano is for the weak, I use vi
15:32  iman: how can i connect to ipod in linux? there are any application like itunes?
15:33  Fieldy: not that i know of

15:33  ManDay: fieldy, you have a minute?
15:34  ManDay: badcloud: flash cant be replaced
15:34  ManDay: flash = flash != lightweight
15:34  Psi-Jack: It really can't. :)
15:34  ManDay: badcloud: what do you need flash for?
15:34  ManDay: if its about videos you can always watch them without flash
15:34  ManDay: (almost always)
15:34  badcloud: ManDay: I mean something like this http://flvideoreplacer-extension.blogspot.com/
15:34  ManDay: ( = often )
15:35  jellow: iman: try gtkpod
15:35  ManDay: badcloud: so actually you are looking for an flv player replacement
15:35  ManDay: not flash per se
15:35  badcloud: yup
15:35  badcloud: my bad on the wording
15:36  ManDay: watch out, Psi-Jack has an itchy finger :p
15:36 --- weltall2 is now known as weltall
15:36  ManDay: badcloud: i think it should be possbile through a userjs
15:36  badcloud: seems like the generic plugin consumes quite a lot of cpu
15:37  Psi-Jack: flv == Flash Video
15:37  ManDay: Psi-Jack: its just a codec, no?
15:37  ManDay: (developed FOR flash)
15:37  badcloud: Psi-Jack: I though the flash part was the player
15:37  Psi-Jack: ManDay: No, it's flash.
15:37  ManDay: Psi-Jack: either way mplayer can play it
15:37  Psi-Jack: flash is the "codec"
15:38  ManDay: Psi-Jack: mplayer can play flv files but not flash - hence i say flash != flv
15:38  ManDay: flv € flash
15:38  kainus: hey people!!! sorry for bother with rare question... but i need to know if is possible thought a ssh connection execute a command for another session (more specify: the X session on that machine).
15:38  iman: jellow, it's not worked - do you more ?
15:38  koala_man: flv euro flash?
15:38  ManDay: kainus: yes
15:38  ManDay: koala_man: ELEMENT of
15:38  gordboy: koala_man: is an element of
15:39  ManDay: you have a poor imagination ;p
15:39  gordboy: but yeah, it looked like euro sign to me as well
15:39  ManDay: well it was one
15:39  ManDay: until i had found the right UTF-8 everyone would have forgotten what the context was
15:40  kainus: ManDay> please give mi a tip to look it on internet... im really lost about how to make the search :S
15:40  gordboy: is flash a set, group, ring or field ? i think we should be told
15:40  ManDay: kainus: ask #xorg - generally x is not build to have commands from outside itssession. you need to fake tha authz to the X session and adress the right DISPLAY
15:41  koala_man: /completion elementof ∈
15:41  ManDay: koala_man: is there a key combo for that?
15:41  kainus: ManDay> thanks man... i will continue my quest for that path! (?)
15:41  koala_man: if you run that in irssi, you can use elementof<tab>
15:41  ManDay: hm
15:41  ManDay: ty
15:42  ManDay: but is there a key shortcut for it, too?
15:42  koala_man: dunno
15:42 * ManDay stares at koala_man
15:42  ManDay: :P
15:42  ManDay: k
15:42  koala_man: you could check the multikey map
15:42  gordboy: U+2208
15:42  Mkman: Hey!
15:43  ManDay: oh being there already, is there a UNIVERSAL way to insert an UTF-8 of arbitrary code in Xorg?
15:43  ManDay: on a gmern keyboard ich can type łĸđð
15:43  ManDay: with Alt Gt+...
15:43  ManDay: but its not a generic way
15:43  ManDay: and most of the times i foget which UTF8 sits where
15:43  ManDay: *german
15:44  marduk: XCompose
15:44  ManDay: is that a dish?
15:44 * ManDay googles
15:44  marduk: man XCompose
15:44  ManDay:  man XCompose
15:45  ManDay: fopen: No such file or directory
15:45  ManDay: Cannot open man page /usr/share/man/man/Compose.5.bz2
15:45  ManDay: No manual entry for XCompose
15:45  ManDay: ^ thats something new, lol
15:45  gordboy: marduk: i'm just wondering if you _can_ compose that letter
15:46  marduk: whic letter?
15:47  gordboy: the unicode "element of" letter. U+2208
15:47  sedulous: ManDay: unless you have it on the keyboard, you will have to re-assign a key to serve as the compose key
15:48  sedulous: for example the right "context menu" key
15:48  marduk: oh
15:48  gordboy: not all letters are capable of being "composed". in fact i'd say the percentage is pretty low ...
15:48  marduk: i don't think i can with my defaults, but i can create one
15:49  sedulous: other than that you can define your own modifier combinations, for example on my systems "AltGr c" yields ☕
15:49  sedulous: (with Xmodmap)
15:49  marduk: you can create a custom ~/.XCompose
15:50  marduk: but i think you have to restart x for the changes maybe
15:50  vlrk: can any body tell me what " -fPIC  " in terms of Makefile or compiling ?
15:50  gordboy: vlrk: position independent code, for shared libs
15:51  vlrk: one my build fails with message like
15:51  vlrk: " /usr/bin/ld: .libs/extutil.o: relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against `xgeExtRegister' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
15:51  vlrk: "
15:51  vlrk: gordboy: thx
15:53  vlrk: where should i exactly keep that ..! i.e while compiling the .c file ..? can any body help in this regard
15:53  gordboy: vlrk: is it c source ?
15:53  gordboy: for c it is CFLAGS iirc. for assembler ASFLAGS
15:54  vlrk: i pasted my error log here http://pastebin.ca/2002944
15:55  vlrk: may be this gives more info on the problem iam facing
15:55  gordboy: no, it doesn't
15:55  gordboy: just add -fPIC to the CFLAGS
15:55  gordboy: ... in the Makefile
15:58  RenatoSilva: how to know if sed succeed?
15:59  karthee: echo "$?"
15:59  karthee: should be 0
15:59  karthee: RenatoSilva: are you using any pipes ?
15:59  RenatoSilva: karthee: I want something better than ifconfig | grep ppp -A 1 | grep inet | sed -r 's/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/'
16:00  RenatoSilva: karthee: that'll get the ppp ip
16:01  RenatoSilva: karthee: but if for some reason it can't match and get the group, I want something like "error" not the entire line
16:01  karthee: RenatoSilva:   val=$(ifconfig | grep ppp -A 1 | grep inet | sed -r 's/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/); if [ "$val" == "" ]; then  echo "error occured"
16:02  gordboy: vlrk: are you using a Makefile (and the make command), or are you just using gcc at the command line ?
16:02  ManDay: sedulous: do you think a generic compose key is possible - or at least one that can cover more chars - like the ALT+NB1234 on windows?
16:03  RenatoSilva: karthee: thanks but do you have anything clearer?
16:03  karthee: RenatoSilva: PIPESTATUS[0] will tell you ifconfig failed  or not... PIPESTATUS[1] will tell you if grep ppp -A 1 failed or not  and so on .
16:03  gordboy: the basic problem with extended unicode letters is that not all fonts support all possible letters
16:03  MrElendig: RenatoSilva: /sys and /proc
16:03  MrElendig: RenatoSilva: much better than parsing ifconfig
16:04  RenatoSilva: MrElendig: how exactly
16:05  RenatoSilva: karthee: how PIPESTATUS[0] is related to what you said before
16:06  karthee:  command1 | command2 | command3 ....   pipestatus[0] will give you the status code of command1 and  pipestatus[1] will give for command2 and so on .. if status code is not 0 then it means the command failed ..
16:13  RenatoSilva: karthee: your example doesn't work
16:13  karthee: RenatoSilva: ?
16:14  RenatoSilva: ??
16:14 * Fieldy gives karthee the tooth pulling pliars
16:14  RenatoSilva: (13:01:53) karthee: RenatoSilva:   val=$(ifconfig | grep ppp -A 1 | grep inet | sed -r 's/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/); if [ "$val" == "" ]; then  echo "error occured"
16:16  RenatoSilva: you missed fi but even that doesn't fix it
16:18  ecolitan: I'm having trouble setting up a raid5 with mdadm, it only creates a degraded array: http://pastebin.com/rRvqgMfA
16:20  Psi-Jack: ecolitan: Are all the partitions being provided the same size?
16:21  Psi-Jack: Or, rather, all the drives?
16:21  ecolitan: Psi-Jack: no, one is slightly smaller, which should mean that some space will be wasted on the other two drives
16:22  gordboy: heh. i just found another way to enter unicode chars. with ctrl-shift-u, then keeping ctrl-shift down, entering the hex unicode number on the numeric keypad
16:22  Psi-Jack: ecolitan: In raid5, all points should be the /same/ size.
16:22  Psi-Jack: ecolitan: You see that error where mdadm: largest drive (/dev/sdc) exceed size (156290816K) by more than 1% ?
16:23  gordboy: there's no place like Ω
16:23  ecolitan: Psi-Jack: i'm aware of that /should/ ... but it should still work, I just lose the difference in space
16:25  ecolitan: Used Dev Size : 156290816 - goes down to the size of the smallest element
16:28  RenatoSilva: karthee: $ alias ip='v=`ifconfig ppp0 | grep inet | sed -r "s/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/" | grep "^[0-9]"`; test "$v" = "" && v="unknown"; echo "$v"'
16:32  RenatoSilva: karthee: $ alias ip='ifconfig ppp0 | grep inet | sed -r "s/^.*inet end.: (.*) P-a-P.*$/\1/" | grep -v inet || echo unkown'
16:32  RenatoSilva: * unknown
16:34  RenatoSilva: in your example I accidentally replaced = with -eq
16:36  mino: hi :)
16:37  bluj: hi!
16:38  mino: does somebody know a good workarround to get a sort of login shell with bash? I want a window on my desktop where you need to type in username and password to get console access
16:39  marduk: mino: why not lock your screen?
16:40  marduk: mino: there are ways but of course there are ways around them ;)
16:40  mino: marduk: this is kiosk computer... the user is totally restricted to use specific programs
16:41  mino: marduk: and the use of a terminal should be allowed but only if he enters username and password
16:41  marduk: wait.. what do you mean by "console access"?
16:41  mino: wait... i think i have an idea :D... start ssh with username@localhost
16:42  mino: console access = terminal window on the desktop
16:42  _abc_: wo finde ich einen alsa guru?
16:42  marduk: that's not a console
16:42  mino: marduk: in the terminal is a console running
16:42  marduk: mino: if you are using gnome they have ways you can lock down stuff
16:42  mino: marduk: like bash/sh/zsh and so on
16:43  mino: marduk: there ways to lockdown stuff are very poor... i use fluxbox atm with autologin and edited menues
16:43  _abc_: erm where do I find an alsa guru
16:43  marduk: mino: ok.. your terminology is kinda confusing me
16:46  marduk: X runs in a console, xterm is a terminal (emulator) that runs under X. bash is a shell that runs in a terminal (emulator) (but not necessarily)
16:47  KU0N: hello folks
16:51  suzu: hi
16:51  marduk: you can also call screen and have it lock by default
16:51  mbruins: does this http://debian.pastebin.com/L28iDWCw mean im only allowed to acces ssh from root and they blocked adding another user with a dirty hack?
16:52  micols: mbruins: no
16:52  micols: adduser <username>
16:52  PingFloyd: how dependable does it need to be locking them out of a shell without logging in?
16:52  mbruins: micols: im sorry
16:52  mbruins: and thanks
16:53  mino: marduk: okay, so with that terminology i want a terminal(emulator) with login prompt or a shell with login prompt...
16:53  PingFloyd: sound like you're talking about shell
16:54  marduk: mino: you cold use the ssh approach as you said but i would use screen
16:54  marduk: also has the advantage of all the other screen advantages
16:54  mino: marduk: the ssh approach doesnt work
16:54  PingFloyd: generally the concern is user access as apposed to shell access, if they have physical access
16:55  mino: marduk: konsole -e "ssh user@localhost" is abortable and so the user has access
16:55  micols: mino: you can use screen to lock your window , ctrl+a+x to lock, also you can use ratpoison wm to get fullscreen xterms (like ttys just higher resolution)
16:55  marduk: abortable?
16:55  micols: and combine it with unclutter to get rid of the mouse completely
16:55  mino: hmm guys i think you dont get it
16:56  mino: i have a desktop session with fluxbox running
16:56  micols: also you can use xscreensaver to autolock your screen after x minutes
16:56  Psi-Jack: mino: Or rather, it sounds like what you're trying to do, is a little ridiculous.
16:56  mino: and there should be the possibility to open a terminal emulator with a login prompt otherwise you cant access the terminal
16:56  Psi-Jack: cause, I still have not figured out at all, exactly what you're really trying to do.
16:56  marduk: wait you are running full kde?
16:56  mino: no
16:56  mino: fluxbox
16:56 --- MuzerAway is now known as Muzer
16:56  marduk: but you just said konsole
16:56  mino: kde is only my terminal emulator atm
16:57  Psi-Jack: mino: You're already logged in, that's the whole thing right there!
16:57  Psi-Jack: You're ALREADY LOGGED IN.
16:57  marduk: kde is a your terminal emulator?!
16:57  marduk: fucking huge terminal emulator
16:57  Psi-Jack: marduk: Language policy, please advise it.
16:57  mino: i know
16:57  marduk: sigh
16:57  mino: Psi-Jack why? The user is automatically logged in via gdm
16:58  marduk: gdm?!
16:58  Psi-Jack: mino: As in, logged in, already.
16:58  marduk: (this is going from bad to worse)
16:58  mino: he dont know the password of the machine ... and in fluxbox is opening only
16:58  Psi-Jack: mino: What's the point of an already logged in user to be prompted to login again?
16:59  mino: This user should have desktop link to a terminal emulator but only if he gain the access by authenticating to a normal user on this machine
16:59  marduk: so.. you are using gdm to log into fluxbox so you can run konsole and ask you for a password?
16:59  Psi-Jack: mino: Sounds like you're doing /everything/ backwards.
16:59  mino: marduk: not only console ... there is also a small music player who runs default...
17:00  Psi-Jack: mino: Linux != Windows, you don't have already logged in users logging into another user.
17:00 * marduk closes his ears
17:00  PingFloyd: well that changes everything! a music player
17:00  _spm_Draget: Is there a dummy-x or something that I can use for apps that create a gui, but I want to run them only on the console?
17:00  marduk: er... eyes
17:00  mino: this is a public accessible machine
17:00  mino: students come there to listen to music
17:01  Psi-Jack: sigh
17:01  marduk: try screen then
17:01  marduk: but the whole idea seems kinda...
17:01  mino: i wanted a possibility to get console access for certain users
17:01  marduk: nm
17:01 * Psi-Jack stops trying.
17:02  CodeNinja: :|
17:02  CodeNinja: my drive is still fscking itself
17:02  mino: marduk if invoke a terminal (emulator) and run a screen it... the user can abort the screen and access the console without login
17:02 * marduk stops crying
17:02  marduk: mino: how?
17:02  sybariten: do you often find yourselves "investigating" a lot of scripts, and their connections/dependancies to other scripts?
17:02  Psi-Jack: CTRL+C
17:03  mino: pressing CTRL A + D
17:03  mino: or exit
17:03  mino: or whatever
17:03  marduk: but if you -e screen then contrl-c just closes the terminal
17:03  marduk: (i'm speaking for xterm i don't know konsole)
17:03  Psi-Jack: mino: Change the bindings in screen and disable detaching.
17:03  mino: marduk okay i will try it with xterm
17:03  mino: hopefully it works :P
17:04  Psi-Jack: Also, write a script that calls screen, when it's done, exit.
17:04  marduk: ctrl a + d closes screen which closes your terminal
17:04  mino: Psi-Jack but i cant change the behaviour of "exit"
17:04  Psi-Jack: mino: Use that script to call screen.
17:04  mino: hmm
17:04  Psi-Jack: Ta-Da
17:04  mino: i will try :P stay tuned... thanks for your patience and help already
17:04  Psi-Jack: Horrible logic, but, yeah. Whatever.
17:06  marduk: still there are ways around it
17:06  Psi-Jack: Which, there will always be, with such attrocious methods.
17:06  PingFloyd: I think the whole thing is kind of pissing in the wind
17:06  marduk: but if you are running kde, gdm, fluxbox and whatever else there are probably many ways around it
17:07  PingFloyd: just take the designed approach--make sure their access as a user is limited instead
17:08  mbruins: hi i just got a vps but everytime i run a command i get http://debian.pastebin.com/UpGkMR4a the command this works but i there away i can fix this error and i dont mean make it disapear but just fix the system? im not sure where to google on
17:08  mbruins: s/this/still/
17:08  mbruins: s/i/is/
17:08  mbruins: sorry i typ with alot of lag atm
17:09  Psi-Jack: mbruins: Have you contacted your VPS service provider about this issue?
17:10  mino: marduk, Psi-Jack, PingFloyd: this is not a security feature... it should only stop the most obvious options of damaging the machine...
17:10  Psi-Jack: mino: What are you doing, logging X in as root through gdm autologin?
17:10  mino: okay great -e really exits the terminal emulator when the command exits
17:10  marduk: mino i would just have rc.local or inittab or whatver run X with the *one* program you need to run... if anyone needs administrative access they can ctr-alt-f1 and log in through the console.. as a different user and don't even give the kiosk user a shell
17:10  mbruins: Psi-Jack: not really, i actually rented this box because i would like to learn more about debian and perhaps help so i would like to fix it myself but im not sure where to start
17:11  Psi-Jack: mbruins: You should contact the VPS support for issues related to their problems, which if you just got this out of the box, it's their problem.
17:11  Psi-Jack: Afterall, that's what you're paying for,.
17:11  mbruins: Psi-Jack: hm actually i think youre right
17:11  mino: crtl-alt-f* keys are disabled already
17:11  mbruins: im gonna contact them now
17:13  DLange: mbruins: dpkg-reconfigure locales
17:13  mino: i use now in .fluxbox/menu a command that starts a terminal emulator with -e screen and this screen session starts ssh username@localhost
17:15  mino: really funky
17:15  mbruins: DLange: thats it??
17:15  marduk: mino: you can just have screen lock instead of ssh
17:15  mbruins: DLange: thanks alot
17:15  DLange: mbruins: probably (on Debian and Ubuntu)
17:15  mbruins: so what the most normal and basic english standard there is?
17:15  mino: marduk: okay great idea
