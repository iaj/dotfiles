08:30  nightwalk: flamethrower
08:30  Psi-Jack-: d1b: What user are you logged in as trying to do kill -9 pid?
08:30  d1b: Psi-Jack-: did it as root ^ ^
08:31  sauvin: with (garlic, oak_stave, mallet, holy_water); do extirpate pid; end;
08:31 * nightwalk is disappointed more linux games don't have flamethrowers in them, btw
08:31  Psi-Jack-: ps aux | grep pidnumber (where pidnumber is the actual number of the pid)
08:31  panik: bahahaha @ sauvin
08:31  mosno: megana, well?
08:31  megana: command tab
08:31  d1b: Psi-Jack-: it is nautilus...
08:31  Psi-Jack-: ps aux | grep pidnumber (where pidnumber is the actual number of the pid)
08:31  megana: I told you o_O
08:31  d1b: i know this ^ ^
08:32  mosno: megana, command tab switches applications. it does not restore a minimized window
08:32  Psi-Jack-: d1b: So SHOW ME!
08:32  panik: the output
08:32  megana: you gotta hold option
08:32 --- Channel ##linux was synced in 117 seconds
08:32  d1b: 2875  0.0  4.2 1051376 160092 ?      D    Nov23   2:12 nautilus
08:33  lautriv|afk: d1b, maybe a network mount around ?
08:33  megana: did you get it mosno?
08:33  d1b: lautriv|afk: not any more
08:33  d1b: and i still can't kill it
08:33  axle3d: #ettercap
08:33  mosno: megana, so say  i have Application A open. It has 1 visible window and 2 minimised windows. I then switch to Application B with command-tab. Are you saying that if I then press command-option-tab, then the window manager switches to Application A and restores all minimised windows of the app?
08:33  faLUCE: hi. I have a capture card which is mapped as /dev/video0 . I can access it, but not with two programs at the same time. how can I solve?
08:33  lautriv|afk: d1b, but while nautilus was open
08:34  d1b: ....
08:34  Psi-Jack-: d1b: If you're not going to follow instructions, I'm not going to continue trying to help you.
08:34  megana: I dunno mosno, just that minimized stuff comes back when you hold option
08:35  nightwalk: faLUCE: probably should explain what you're trying to do a little more
08:35  mosno: megana, i'll play with it tonight and let you know
08:35  megana: :P okay
08:35  d1b: Psi-Jack-: what?
08:36  Psi-Jack-: d1b: If you're not going to follow instructions, I'm not going to continue trying to help you.
08:36  d1b: erh... i pasted it ...
08:36  Psi-Jack-: That was not the output as I requested.
08:36  d1b: what?
08:36  d1b: you asked for ps aux |grep it
08:36  faLUCE: nightwalk: I need to access this capture card (which uses v4l2) through two different programs. when I open the video with one program it's all ok, but I can't access it with another program simoultaneously....
08:36  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Right, and that's not what you provided.
08:37  d1b: bob 2875  0.0  4.2 1051376 160092 ?      D    Nov23   2:12 nautilus
08:37  Supergirl: That looks like a 'ps aux | grep nautilus' to me.
08:37  d1b: it isn't
08:37  d1b: that is ps aux |grep pid
08:37  Psi-Jack-: That's better. :)
08:38  Psi-Jack-: So, nautilus is in an uninteruptible sleep.
08:38  nightwalk: faLUCE: I'm not sure you *can*. At least, not without using a single program as an arbiter. It's kind of like how alsa/oss was in the old days
08:38  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Is this nautilus the parent process of nautilus, or are there others with that processname?
08:39  nightwalk: faLUCE: if this is for accessing something like a webcam, the answer is going to be different than for, say, a dvb card. So again, what are you trying to do?
08:39  d1b: the parent is my gnome-session - there are no other nautilus
08:39  Psi-Jack-: Well, it's neither dead, nor a zombie, but for some reason it's in an uninterruptible sleep and that's why the kill isn't working.
08:40  d1b: Psi-Jack-: can i bring it out of that state?
08:40  faLUCE: nightwalk: I have a video capture card with a single input ... I need to capture the video and then make two different encodings of it, with two different programs
08:41  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Not really no. It would likely be simpler to kill gnome and restart it all. As-in logging out and back in again, since this has been running for DAYS, it might have some memory leaks going on.
08:41  d1b: Psi-Jack-: erh?
08:41  d1b: shouldn't kill -9 not be blockable or handled by the pid and so it gets killed?
08:41  d1b: or because it is uninterruptible sleep - the scheduler will not kill it?
08:42  Psi-Jack-: What does Uninteruptible mean to you?
08:42  d1b: nothing when the process is my user and root says die
08:42  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Root != god
08:42  Supergirl: killall -15 nautilus?
08:42  nightwalk: faLUCE: I can think of at least a few ways of doing that which don't require concurrent access to the device. However, since you said that's what you want to do, I'll suggest you look into ffmpeg as a transcoding server or vlc
08:43  faLUCE: nightwalk: I need to make a proxy applicatiion in user space which duplicates streams
08:43  Psi-Jack-: The only way to kill an uninteruptible process in sleep is to kill it's parent. What is it's parent? gnome-session.
08:43  Psi-Jack-: If that fails, reboot.
08:43  d1b: no matter im compiling a new kernel.
08:43  d1b: reboot will be soon ^ ^
08:43  Psi-Jack-: Which could be the reason it's in a D state to begin with.
08:44  Psi-Jack-: Compiling, Lots of I/O operations going on.
08:44  Psi-Jack-: What a concept. ;)
08:44  d1b: Psi-Jack-: this isn't the case ;)
08:44  Psi-Jack-: You just said you wer compiling a new kernel.
08:44  Psi-Jack-: Is this true or incorrect?
08:45  lautriv|afk: Psi-Jack, are you serious ? that's kinda wintendo-bahaviour not linux-like.
08:45  Psi-Jack-: lautriv|afk: I'm completely serious.
08:45  lautriv|afk: Psi-Jack, check you hardware then :P
08:45  nightwalk: faLUCE: http://www.ilovemyjournal.com/?action=view_entry&eid=3840 <---basic ffmpeg command you need
08:46  Psi-Jack-: You don't kill uninteruptable sleeping processes. To even consider forcibly removing it by some obscure means could cause the kernel to be left in a VERY unstable state and not be worth keeping running.
08:46  megana: its thanksgiving in NYC :D
08:46  sauvin: In Chicago, too.
08:46  nightwalk: faLUCE: to have it transcode to a second stream, you'd tack on another output file name and whatever other options are required to get it transcoded just right
08:47  lwizardl: hi
08:47  d1b: Psi-Jack-: not yet
08:49  faLUCE: nightwalk: in which way?
08:49  lwizardl: is there a way using grub to make it so that you can program a button combo to launch an application ? like f12 boots X
08:50  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Just for curiousity, please do: ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm | grep 2875
08:51  karthick87: By mistake when cleaning up , i have deleted a file from my Desktop.I badly need that file,is it possible to recover the file?
08:51  d1b: 2875  2875 TS       -   0  19   1  0.0 D    blkdev_get     nautilus
08:52  Psi-Jack-: d1b: So, it locked up reading something, basically.
08:52  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Some kind of optical or removable device perhaps?
08:53  grumpyrj: karthick87: no backups?
08:53  sauvin: karthick87, how exactly did you delete it?
08:53  d1b: Psi-Jack-: usb.
08:53  Psi-Jack-: d1b: And did you just suddenly remove the USB before properly unmounting it?
08:54  lautriv: :-)
08:54  sgtyork: I'm looking for an application to be a 'video gallery menu' to manage the viewing of various videos I have on my hard drive.   (firing of VLC or something to play the video).  I want to have a simple user menu to select the video to watch.  Is there something out there like this?
08:54  karthick87: sauvin: that was on open office document..Deleted by pressing SHIFT+DELETE
08:54  sgtyork: I sort of envisioned setting up my 'video database' in an xml file or something.
08:54  d1b: Psi-Jack-: not really. seems to be due to giving it to a kvm guest, trying to use it and ejecting it
08:54  grumpyrj: karthick87: how important? if it's really important you could possibly get it back from a dd image of the drive
08:55  sauvin: karthick87, it *may* be in some kind of trash thingie on your desktop.
08:55  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Have you tried plugging the USB device back in, and seenig if it recovers?
08:55  grumpyrj: but the sooner you do that the better, as in NOW otheriwse that space may be overwritten
08:55  d1b: Psi-Jack-: yes
08:55  Psi-Jack-: No go, eh?
08:55  karthick87: grumpyrj: Thats really important
08:55  d1b: my kernel should be done very soon, so this is not really a concern
08:55  karthick87: sauvin: I have seen the trash, no files were there.
08:56  grumpyrj: reboot from a live CD NOW and dd the drive to some other drive or computer.
08:56  Psi-Jack-: d1b: Well, now you know a close area of what the root cause of the lockup occured. ;)
08:56  grumpyrj: The longer you wait here the higher the chance you will ose it
08:56  d1b: Psi-Jack-: oh i know this ^ ^
08:56  d1b: i wanted a solution, not to understand the cause ;)
08:56  Psi-Jack-: No, you might've assumed before. ;)
08:56  karthick87: grumpyrj: dd image?how
08:56  Psi-Jack-: Now, you actually /know/ ;-)
08:56  d1b: Psi-Jack-: oh i know
08:57  d1b: ^ ^
08:57  karthick87: grumpyrj: what i want to do exactly after booting from live cd
08:57  grumpyrj: karthick87: do you have anothr computer you can irc from. you need to stop using your system NOW
08:57  Psi-Jack-: d1b: But yeah, solution == kill parent, if that doesn't kill it, well, yeah.. Nothing will.
08:57  d1b: ok.
08:57  grumpyrj: NOOOOWWWWWW
08:57  d1b: i just found it weird.
08:58  karthick87: grumpyrj: Yeah i have,wait a min
08:58  Psi-Jack-: Yeah, Status "D" is like Dead, but not really Dead
08:58  d1b: ok
08:58  Psi-Jack-: Hopefully don't see that often, but when it happends, it's annoying as hell.
08:58  karthick87: grumpyrj: brb
08:58  grumpyrj: shut down that pc now
08:58  Psi-Jack-: D is almost as bad as Zombies. ;)
08:58 * sauvin notes that D processes seem to be common around Halloween...
08:58  Psi-Jack-: Except that Zombies get autocleaned after a bit.
08:59  sauvin: When did zombies start getting autocleaned? I've not seen a zombie in quite a while, and they used to drive me NUTS.
08:59  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: So take your Windows slappery somewhere else. ;)
09:00  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: I fart in your general direction. :)
09:00 * sauvin counterfarts with extreme prejudice
09:01  lautriv: Psi-Jack, heh you're in ##linux if your opinion is the opposite, go there and ask for an op :P
09:01  evanton: he is an op himself
09:01  evanton: so he could fart without suffering the consequences
09:01 * Psi-Jack- widens an eye.
09:01  totem: Psi-Jack, do you ubuntu too?
09:01  karthick87: grumpyrj: there?
09:02  Psi-Jack-: totem: For servers, sure. Maybe netbooks even.
09:02  ShapeShifter499: hi
09:02  grumpyrj: karthick87: yep. is that other machine powered off now?
09:02  sauvin: I have jaunty installed on a netbook but not sure how I feel about it.
09:02  totem: Psi-Jack, oh nice
09:02  karthick87: grumpyrj: booting that using a live cd
09:03  karthick87: grumpyrj: pm?
09:03  ShapeShifter499: I need your guys opinion, I have an opportunity to get a new portable device, I have an 300-350 $ dollar limit, and this device must be able to do a ton of things fast and must have a camera (built-in or add on)
09:03  ShapeShifter499: what do you guys think?
09:04  grumpyrj: karthick87:  ok. so obvious background. when you delete a file the space is free to be used by another file. It could happen at any time after it is deleted, hence the urgency. The data itself hopefully won't be overwritten so you can now search that partition to find you missing file
09:04  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: So, how would you go about killing a process that's in an Uninteruptible sleep state?
09:04 * Psi-Jack- grabs some popcorn and watches.
09:04  grumpyrj: karthick87: however it could be anywhere on the drive. It will start at the beginning of a block and go for some unknown length.
09:05  grumpyrj: karthick87: do you know roughly how big the file was?
09:05  karthick87: grumpyrj: yup it was nearly 8 MB
09:05  grumpyrj: there are some tools for recovering files that will id the file but you can do it manually.
09:06  grumpyrj: eeeww 8MB. it may well be fragmented but hopefully not. what file system?
09:06  grumpyrj: if it's fragmented it will be much more difficult to put together
09:06  karthick87: ext3 i guess how to check the file system?
09:06  grumpyrj: you'll probably be able to get the text back. is the text the most important stuff or images inside the document?
09:06  Psi-Jack-: e2fsck
09:07  Psi-Jack-: karthick87: You cannot check a filesystem while mounted, so unmount it first.
09:07  grumpyrj: wait. don't do that
09:07  grumpyrj: he doesn't want to check it, just know what type it is. WE DO NOT WANT TO CHECK IT FOR ERRORS
09:07  Psi-Jack-: Oh, well, file /dev/blah
09:07  karthick87: grumpyrj: I need that complete doc atleast all the texts..Images are not much important
09:08  grumpyrj: karthick87: ok, well if it's important you will be able to get the text back anyway
09:08  grumpyrj: it will take a while though. is it _really_ important?
09:08  Psi-Jack-: Or rather, file -s /dev/node
09:09  grumpyrj: you can't replace it and repeat a few hours work to restore it?
09:09  karthick87: yup thats really important :(
09:09  grumpyrj: it's that important and you don't have backups?!
09:09  mrcarrot: photorec can do the work for you... boot a live cd with photorec and tell it only to recover files of the type your document was.... i takes a while
09:09  lautriv: Psi-Jack, i told about this part :
09:09  lautriv: <Psi-Jack-> Which could be the reason it's in a D state to begin with.
09:09  lautriv:  Compiling, Lots of I/O operations going on.
09:09  grumpyrj: don't do anything yet
09:09  Psi-Jack-: grumpyrj: Of course it's extremely important not to have backups of extremely important stuff.
09:09  grumpyrj: before you meddle with anything you need to tak an image of the drive
09:10  lautriv: Psi-Jack, and some i/o does not freeze a filemanager
09:10  grumpyrj: if you screw something up you can restore that and try again
09:10  karthick87: grumpyrj: do i want to run file -s /dev/node ???
09:10  grumpyrj: then you can try any tools out you like
09:10  grumpyrj: yeah, taht'll be safe
09:10  jelly-hme: backups are for wimps!
09:10  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: I'm waiting for me to tell me how you'd kill a process that's in an Uninteruptible sleep state, replay past conversation.
09:10  Supergirl: Klingons do NOT make backups!
09:11  mrcarrot: photorec is harmless... so try photorec first. from a live-cd with a usb hd connected
09:11  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: Ironic though, what caused nautilus to go into this state was READING A BLOCK DEVICE. Which guess what, is I/O
09:11  grumpyrj: the _first_ thing to do is always take an image. always.
09:11  karthick87: grumpyrj: I am not sure which node it is..Can i see that now?
09:12  grumpyrj: don't worry about what fs it is, I was just curious about the risk of fragmentation. it is not important
09:12  grumpyrj: you need to get an image of the partition then you are safe to do anything else
09:12  lautriv: Psi-Jack, IF i had to, i would kill the parent, depending on the context BUT what i told you was about your claim the kernel-compile could be the reason.
09:14  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: Heh. Really depends, on how reliable, or unreliable the overal hardware is.
09:15  Psi-Jack-: An unreliable system, compiling causes a lot of stress to, especially on systems running something like Gentoo, where you compile /everything/. :)
09:16  krang: Can anyone explain to me why this simple pattern won't match?  echo "Tooltip('0'" | grep "Tooltip..[0-9]+"
09:16  Psi-Jack-: And yes, I have seen systems that compiling, causes lots of stuff to melt down and cry after hours of constant compiling. Not even close to top-grade hardware, in fact, pretty cheap budget crap that wasn't worth much.
09:16  mrcarrot: grumpyrj: i do not agree... i rescue files almost daily, latest today. if you do not boot the system, then you are not risking to get it overwritten. to save the whole partition takes a lot of space, that is only good to do if you suspect that the hd might be broken
09:16  krang: If I lose the '+', it does
09:16  lautriv: Psi-Jack, if nautilus becomes D, there is either a badblock from a half-death drive or a stale NFS and not just some I/O
09:17  mrcarrot: grumpyrj: photorec is not restoring the partition that it is searching on, it is working straight on an umounted dev searching it for files, that is why a live-cd is good to use together with an usb-hd
09:17  mrcarrot: grumpyrj: it will only save to other partitions than the one it is searching on
09:18  mordy: how do i make a shared library from a bunch of static libraries?
09:18  Psi-Jack-: mordy: You don't.
09:18  mordy: or is that not possible
09:18  Psi-Jack-: You compile them as shared libraries.
09:18  mordy: i don't see why not
09:18  mordy: no, i want all the static libraries to be one big library that functions as a shared blob
09:19  mordy: purely to save memory
09:19 * Psi-Jack- widens an eye.
09:19  Psi-Jack-: That's absurd thought. Shared libraries DO save memory over static libraries.
09:20  mordy: i know, but i want to selectively choose what's static and what's shared
09:20  mrcarrot: it really has to be a very common library to save some memory
09:20  mordy: or if it's a static binary that's being run in multiple instances
09:20  mordy: and i'm using static merely for the sake of convenience
09:20  mordy: eliminating the need for dependencies being installed all across
09:21  mordy: but it would be nice if i could roll on all the static libraries into something like libfoodep.so
09:21  vandemar: how would an app know if the required version of some function is available?
09:21  mordy: i dont' see why it *wouldn't* be possible.. i could be wrong though
09:21  Psi-Jack-: Anyone seen where I left my electric cluebat?
09:22  vandemar: your new library blob would have to have per-function versioning information
09:22  Psi-Jack-: Or maybe even my knock-some-sense-into-them bat?
09:22  mordy: vandemar: that wouldn't be an issue here.. as the content in the shared library wouldn't be changing
09:24  mrcarrot: mordy: are you making your own distro?
09:24  mordy: no
09:24  Psi-Jack-: LOL
09:24  Psi-Jack-: No, mordy's just off-his-gord crazy. ;)
09:25  vandemar: mordy: so if there's a vulnerability in zlib, how do you upgrade it without changing the library megablob?
09:26 * jelly-hme wonders just how exactly do shared libraries save ram over static ones
09:26  mordy: vandemar: now you're arguing over the merits of having a static library altogether which isn't what i want to get into
09:26  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: They're loaded, once, into memory, and shared with anything else needing it.
09:26  mrcarrot: jelly-hme: a shared one is only loaded ones even if 1000 programs are using it... a static is included in the binary for all those 1000 programs
09:26  mordy: i'm not a vendor that's distributing something to users
09:26  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: where does it say that?
09:26  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: That's why shared objects even exist!
09:26  mordy: i just need to maintain a single binary over multiple platforms, multiple different platforms
09:26  Psi-Jack-: Why ELF was born.
09:27  vandemar: mordy: you just said the library wouldn't change
09:27  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: I thought they existed to save on disk space, not ram.
09:27  Psi-Jack-: Why a.out is something so few people even know what it is anymore.
09:27  mordy: vandemar: i mean that the program and the library will be distributed together
09:27  jelly-hme: also, maintainability.
09:27  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: It's all of the above.
09:27  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: do you have an actual reference for "memory pages for shared libs are shared"?
09:28  sauvin: it's a penguin's dll
09:28  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: You seriously don't know this, and want to argue about it? LOL
09:28  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: I seriously would like to see a reference.
09:29  vandemar: mordy: but it would still be versioned, right?  so basically what you want is similar to how it works right now, except eliminating any file naming issues for libraries... one repository with all the needed versions of all libraries for all apps?
09:30  mordy: vandemar: right now i'm just using a 30MB binary
09:30  vandemar: mordy: let's suppose, though, that app A is compiled against glibc 2.12.1, and app B is compiled against 2.11.  You want the central library repository to have both 2.11 and 2.12.1, even though the 2.11 app will run just fine on a system with only 2.12.1?
09:31  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computing%29
09:31  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: This applies to Windows DLL's /and/ Linux/Unix DSOs.
09:31  vandemar: mordy: that would be better than static libraries, I suppose, but only slightly.
09:33  mordy: ok.. apparently the object files need to be compiled with -fpic :(
09:34  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: this explains concepts.  It also mentions "Programs can accomplish RAM sharing by using position independent code".  Nowhere it says all the distros actually do that.
09:34  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: Okay. www.kernel.org, start digging.
09:35  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: so you don't have a reference, sad.
09:35  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: I just know.
09:35  RingtailedFox: hiya, guys... how do i export the results of ls -l -r to a text file?  (can i even do ls -l recursively on subdirectories?)
09:35  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: heh
09:35  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: I was there the days when we were all screaming in horror over the a.out to ELF conversion process.
09:36  mrcarrot: jelly-hme: if you really want to verify, compile a simple program statically and check the ram usage when you start up 1000 instances of it... and compare with a dynamic one
09:36  mrcarrot: Psi-Jack-: end of the 90's :)
09:37  mrcarrot: i had not internet but i noticed the transision...
09:37  Psi-Jack-: End of? Are you kidding?
09:38  mrcarrot: i think some distros still used a.out at that time...
09:38  Psi-Jack-: 1994, man. Not even the middle of the 90's. ;)
09:38  RingtailedFox: if what i want to do can't be done, that's alright
09:38  sauvin: I remember having to dig around for a.out capability on the version of linux I'd chucked onto my computer just for giggles somewhere in '97.
09:38  sauvin: I don't remember which linux that was, but it'd already gone ELF.
09:38  mrcarrot: i bought linux cds from store at that time, so they might have been even older... 1997/1998 i tried the first time linux and then it was a.out
09:41  Ragnar: good morning
09:41  mrcarrot: the very first linux i tried was a really old linux around 97-98 that my boss gave me as it had gotten so old
09:41  Gorroth: i tried linux in 2000.  i failed.
09:41  Ragnar: has any of you tried setting up q-in-q in linux?
09:41  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: I have a vague notion this shared-ram thing is a misunderstanding of two meanings for "shared" in shared library, but I don't have a reference either.
09:41  mordy: jelly-hme: http://pastebin.com/P777Cnb4
09:41  Gorroth: i failed a few times actually
09:42  Gorroth: eventually, i read the FreeBSD handbook and got that working
09:42  mrcarrot: so it might have been from around the middle of the 90's... i believe you are right that it is the middle of the 90's Psi-Jack-
09:42  evanton: Gorroth: you failed it on purpose? o_O
09:42  Gorroth: no
09:43  jelly-hme: mordy: ok...? shared: 240K isn't much, considering the libc parts only are ~5MB
09:45  Ragnar: 802.1QinQ
09:45  mordy: jelly-hme: well, first of all it's quite fuzzy, in addition, pmap only shows how much memory has been accessed
09:46  RingtailedFox: is the appropriate syntax "ls -l; for f in subfolder/* subfolder2/*; do echo ln -s "$f" "${f##*/}"; done"?
09:46  mordy: so the only thing you can say is that 240k of shared code was accessed
09:47  mordy: so your *real* savings with shared libraries is only by a factor of 240k
09:47  mordy: since the kernel will only ever 'use' memory that was actually accessed
09:49  mordy: then again, those are new processes..
09:49  __name__: good day
09:49  __name__: can i tell thunderbird to request confirmation when sending to a certain address?
09:50  Psi-Jack-: jelly-hme: Do you know the difference between RSZ, and VSZ?
09:51  mrcarrot: __name__: that is probably the most hated feature in outlook*.. honestly i have never looked for it in thunderbird as most people hate this
09:51  grumpyrj: !ping
09:51  sauvin: !plop
09:51  grumpyrj: thanks
09:51  jave: hello
09:51  grumpyrj: just checking my lag
09:52  Psi-Jack-: grumpyrj: !ping doesn't work. :p
09:52  jave: I would like to be able to reset my laptop keyboard controller. any hints?
09:52  Psi-Jack-: Just ping users you are actively communicating with, or you know are around. Simpler, more efficient.
09:52  mrcarrot: jave: reboot?
09:52  jave: yes that works but is inneficient
09:53  Psi-Jack-: No, it's not inefficient.
09:53  Psi-Jack-: Oh, wait.
09:53  Psi-Jack-: jave: "reset" your laptop keyboard controller?
09:53  jave: yes
09:53  mrcarrot: faster than to wait for a solution here...
09:53  jave: I need to do it sort of frequently
09:54  Psi-Jack-: jave: Umm..
09:54  Psi-Jack-: Sounds like you have hardware problems then.
09:54  jave: yes
09:54  Psi-Jack-: Major ones.
09:54  Psi-Jack-: Like, time to toss the laptop and replace.
09:54  jave: I do. I'm trying to work around them
09:54  jave: its a nice laptop otherwise
09:54  Psi-Jack-: Like, you can't just reset broken hardware.
09:55  jave: susend/resume also works. its not unknown for the kbd ctroller to be flaky in laptops. the kernel driver takes special measures for a lot of models
09:55  jave: just not for mine
09:56  archeleus: Hmm
09:56  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: conceptual one, sure.  I don't think I even worked out what really counted as RSZ
09:58 * Psi-Jack- grins.
09:58  Psi-Jack-: Sounds like you should.
09:58 * archeleus is bored
09:58  mordy: grrr...
09:58  Psi-Jack-: archeleus: #defocus
09:59  mordy: i know this should be possible with the libraries i'm using but i just can't figure out the right flags for ld
09:59  archeleus: Psi-Jack: later
09:59  mordy: i don't have an input file per se
10:00  digitalstimulus: hello, any raid / mdadm gurus around?
10:00  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Ask, not ask to ask.
10:01  sauvin: I use RAID during the summer when ants invade... does that count?
10:01  Psi-Jack-: sauvin: Only if it's RAID-6.
10:02  sauvin: Think it's more like RAID_Splutter
10:02  Psi-Jack-: sauvin: And that people follow you as a leader as a result of your use of this RAID.
10:02  Psi-Jack-: sauvin: And you deny that you are any sort of leader figure as well.
10:02  digitalstimulus: I am curious why /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf would generate a config with 2 different UUID's for /dev/md0, blkid shows only one of the generated UUID's
10:03  sauvin: The only thing I ever lead is a greyish green cloud of noxious gas.
10:04  digitalstimulus: mkconf seems to be defining 2 separate arrays for the same device but 2 different UUIDs
10:04 * Psi-Jack- widens an eye. /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf?
10:04  digitalstimulus: errm, maybe ubuntu specific
10:04  Psi-Jack-: Definitely not part of mdadm specifically.
10:05  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: dpkg -S /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf
10:06 --- sauvin is now known as bocaneri
10:07  RingtailedFox: i'm trying to figure out how to get ls -l to export its results to a file (like say, files.lst), but to do it for all subdirectories, as well
10:07  jelly-hme: Psi-Jack-: part of debian package mdadm as well
10:07  digitalstimulus: well, that question is more secondary.  The main problem I am having is *sometimes* my raid box drops to a busybox shell in initramfs witha 'device or resource busy'
10:08  bocaneri: RingtailedFox, wouldn't that be something like ls -lr > file ?
10:08  lautriv: RingtailedFox, ls -lR >somefile
10:08  koala_man: RingtailedFox: ls -lR
10:08  RingtailedFox: mmkay, let me see if that works
10:09  digitalstimulus: I read about people having problems with mdadm, so I checked configs and came across the 2 array declarations in mdadm.conf
10:09  RingtailedFox: thanks
10:09  jelly-hme: digitalstimulus: if you're unlucky, one of your devices might have _two_ mdadm signatures.  It can happen because different MD metadata versions are placed at diferent places on the device
10:09 * lautriv has no probs with mdadm
10:09  mrcarrot: speaking about debian and raid... i have real horrorstory or then i just did not know how to do it in debian
10:09  RingtailedFox: that worked. thanks
10:10  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: "drops?"
10:10  digitalstimulus: jelly, that makes sense, these drives have survived a few rebuilds
10:10  mrcarrot: i had to install debian on a piece of hardware that had fakeraid... everything went well until i tried to pull out on hd
10:10  digitalstimulus: i am typing on an N810 thumbpad, forgive my lack of words
10:11  mrcarrot: debian had no dmraid -R to rebuild the raid !!! i went the mdadm raid way instead
10:11  kish: my gateway shows this 10:09:29.136240 IP 10.0.0.3.34671 > zrh1-ns02.monzoon.net.domain: 2040+ AAAA? news.ch. (25)
10:11  kish: oops
10:11  Gorroth: digitalstimulus: i sometimes IRC on an n900
10:11  lautriv: mrcarrot, the fake-way is crap at all
10:12  mrcarrot: but the customer wanted it...
10:12  kish: well, it shows that when it's meant to route packets over a vpn tunnel. the gw ip is 10.0.0.2  and it acccesses a vpn in switzerland but its meant to route the lan over the vpn and not over the local internet connection
10:12  mrcarrot: lautriv: anyway, what is the point of debian to provide dmraid without any way to rebuild?
10:12  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Okay. I'm not having issues with your speed, or lack of words, except, details are necessary when asking for help on something. We're blind, you're not (hoepfully), so, what do you mean by "drops" into a busybox shell?
10:12  digitalstimulus: jelly, maybe if I rebuild in the future I'll do a full wipe
10:15  lautriv: mrcarrot, in this case you have to tell your bios-routines anyway, it is NOT part of the kernel or userland to do so b/c you can't really see what the routines will do.
10:15  Psi-Jack-: Doing a dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd?# bs=1024 count = 10000; should be more than sufficient to wipe any basic headers from drives.
10:15  mrcarrot: lautriv: this fake raid controller wants it done by a program in the operating system... it is not having support to rebuild
10:15  digitalstimulus: psi-, When booting it will stop with a UUID 'device or resource busy' and (initramfs) prompt in a busy box shell
10:16  mordy: grrr.. there is a way to do this, but meh
10:16  lautriv: mrcarrot, one reason more to avoid it. even a cheap SiL raid has this functionality.
10:16  mrcarrot: lautriv: still i have difficult to forgive debian for this thing, when other distros have this option
10:17  lautriv: mrcarrot, the fake way is nothing else a resistent bios-extension, i see no reason to support it in any way.
10:17  digitalstimulus: xchat autocomplete nick fail...no 'tab' key on N810
10:17  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Okay. Gotcha, so during boot up it goes into a emergency mode, gotcha. Where's this raid filesystem mounted normally?
10:18  mrcarrot: lautriv: then they should have been leaving out the dmraid package from the repositories...
10:18  rethus: got this:
10:18  rethus: gpg: WARNUNG: Unsicheres Besitzverhältnis der Konfigurationsdatei `/home/suther/.gnupg/gpg.conf'
10:18  rethus: buit the file is ony r for owner
10:18  Psi-Jack-: rethus: Can you translate that to English?
10:18  rethus: means readable for suther
10:18  mrcarrot: lautriv: or a big warning when you install it... good for me that i tested to pull out one hd
10:18  digitalstimulus: psi, /RAID5
10:18  kish: iptables quandry http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7uYebqAb
10:18  jelly-hme: digitalstimulus: rtfm mdadm(8), see --zero-superblock in Misc mode
10:19  rethus: Yes... unsecure permission for gpg.conf
10:19  kish: i should have asked in #iptables damnit
10:19  bocaneri: What is  Besitzverhältnis ?
10:19  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: /RAID5 isn't a mount point, nomally.
10:20  rethus: Besitzerverhältnis = aignment to owner
10:20  rethus: asignment
10:20  bocaneri: Mmkay.
10:20  rethus: may the problem, that i start the script as root?
10:20  digitalstimulus: custom mount point, mounted in fstab by /dev/md0's UUID
10:20  rethus: but gpg.conf is owned by "suther"
10:21  cablop: is to format my USB as ntfs a bad idea?
10:21  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: And what do you normally do in the recovery mode to get it back to normal?
10:21  digitalstimulus: reboot :)
10:21  Psi-Jack-: cablop: This relates to Linux how?
10:21  bocaneri: cablop, maybe not to Stephen King in a particularly nasty novel of some kind.
10:21  digitalstimulus: it's intermittent
10:21  cablop: i need to hold a file of 6 GB insie it, and fat does not support that file size, but i wonder if ntfs format would render my USB unmountable at some time after an error or sth...
10:22  lautriv: rethus, it needs 0600 (rw)
10:22  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Try changing your mount to use the /dev/md0 directly, or give if a filesystem label and use that, LABEL=blah
10:22  rethus: it was rw before,,, but same message
10:22  Psi-Jack-: Instead of going by UUID, see if it's just failing to lookup the UUID in time for the actual mount.
10:22  cablop: welll it is related cause i don't know if it is easier nowadays to fsck a ntfs filesystem under linux
10:22  rethus: so i think maybe the problem is i run the script which use gpg as root, but the file gpg.conf is owned by suther
10:22  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Also, non-critical mount, perhaps set the pass to 0, instead of 1
10:24  Gorroth: unf!  repackaged nokia's stupid flasher thing that supposedly only works on i386 (according to their control file) to work on amd64
10:24  Gorroth: well, the binary always worked, but i had to cut open the package, add the extra architecture, and repackage it
10:24  cablop: welll it is related cause i don't know if it is easier nowadays to fsck a ntfs filesystem under linux, Psi-Jack
10:24  digitalstimulus: it actually was using /dev/md0 in fstab but just changed to UUID.  rebooted a couple times successfully
10:24  Psi-Jack-: cablop: Umm, it is?
10:24 * Psi-Jack- checks fsck.ntfs, and doesn't see it. 
10:24  Psi-Jack-: Interesting where you pulled this out of your arse.
10:24  digitalstimulus: do you mean set pass to 1 instead of 0?
10:24  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: No.
10:25  cablop: well i tested and fsck.ntfs is not in my distro
10:25  Psi-Jack-: I said change pass to 0, INSTEAD of 1, or 2
10:25  mrcarrot: ntfs is still best checked from a windows computer!
10:25  Psi-Jack-: cablop: So, again. How is this Linux related?
10:26  digitalstimulus: ah, I thought pass went the other way, I had set it to 1, root is set to 0
10:26  mrcarrot: this i know for sure as i have had many broken windows systems from my customers to fix
10:26  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: root SHOUDL ALWAYS be 1.
10:26  cablop: is related because i need to know if ntfs is well supported by linux
10:26  Psi-Jack-: 1 means, first order, primary, 2 secondary, 0 don't bother checking
10:26  digitalstimulus: it defaulted to 0
10:27  digitalstimulus: ubuntu 10.04, let me double check
10:27  Psi-Jack-: digitalstimulus: Debian and Ubuntu both default / to 1 for pass. Every time.
10:28  cablop: ok, then let me retry the question
10:28  Psi-Jack-: Remember, pass is the sixth field of the fstab. The second number at the end.
10:28  digitalstimulus: yes, I see that now.  I must have missed a column when I looked before
10:29 * Psi-Jack- nods.
10:29  cablop: if you were using a ntfs filesystem when some sort of system failure arise, you cannot mount that ntfs with ease in linux, cause those errors are common in usb devices then i guess it is not that easy to mount that device in linux
10:29  scorp007: how do i troubleshoot my network setup? I'm running ubuntu in a VM (Sun VirtualBox) thru NAT.
10:29  scorp007: what should I look for?
10:29  cablop: well, that happened in the past... dunno nowadays
10:30  scorp007: e.g. it can't resolve any dns's
10:30  lautriv: cablop, there is ntfsfix, you may provide a link to fsck.ntfs
10:30  Psi-Jack-: cablop: ntfs-3g from fuser will not recommend mounting an improperly unmounted ntfs filesystem because it cannot check it for consistancy before working with it.
10:31 --- TDNet is now known as TDNet|Mac
10:31  Psi-Jack-: It CAN still mount it, but you may just damage it further.
10:31  cablop: mmm
10:31  cablop: i see
10:31  Psi-Jack-: And even though ntfsfix is there, I wouldn't trust it for anything.
10:32  Psi-Jack-: And certainly don't dare link that to fsck.ntfs, unless it's 100% compatible with fsck command-line argument syntax.
10:32  cablop: any other idea to hold a 6 GB file in that usb and be able to use the usb from linux and win?
10:32 * lautriv rolls over the floor
10:32  cablop: yes Psi-Jacki was tempted but i didn linked
10:33  kish: someone ! http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7uYebqAb
10:33  Psi-Jack-: ntfsfix is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems. ntfsfix is NOT a Linux version of chkdsk. It only repairs some fundamental NTFS inconsistencies, resets the NTFS journal file and schedules an NTFS consistency check for the first boot into Windows.
10:33 * Psi-Jack- beats lautriv with a cluebat. ;)
10:34  Psi-Jack-: kish: That appears... Blank
10:34  digitalstimulus: cablop, why not use ext3 and i forget the name of the ext driver for windows, but it exists
10:34  lautriv: Psi-Jack, c'mon you don't even know ntfsfix before i mentioned it :P
10:34  Psi-Jack-: Windows cannot reliably use ext3, so that results in exactly the same issue as NTFS
10:35  Psi-Jack-: Irony eh?
10:35  cablop: nope, i can cause i can;t install the usb driver in all places i go
10:35  cablop: *can't
10:35  Psi-Jack-: cablop: So, in other words..
10:35  Psi-Jack-: You need a filesystem that primarily Windows can read, but also Linux.
10:35  Psi-Jack-: Which, mind you.
10:35  digitalstimulus: is it possible to break up the file and use fat?
10:35  Psi-Jack-: Windows only has FAT, and NTFS, so, there's your options.
10:36  Psi-Jack-: Of course it's /possible/.
10:36  Psi-Jack-: But it's not convenient, of course. ;)
10:36  cablop: no way
10:36  cablop: it is an encrypted container
10:36  lautriv: with some porn-video :P
10:37  cablop: nope
10:37  cablop: HAHAHA
10:37  Psi-Jack-: Which can be broken up and re-put-back-together.
10:37  Psi-Jack-: Just not with convenience. :p
10:37  cablop: nope, some work stuff and passwords we can't risk to lose at any place
10:37  digitalstimulus: I use truecrypt in a similar fashion, but keep file size within convenient limits
10:37  Psi-Jack-: So you put this on a thumb drive?
10:38  Psi-Jack-: And you dont' want to risk losing it?
10:38  Psi-Jack-: That's kinda dumbfounding by itself.
10:38  digitalstimulus: washing machine's revenge
10:38  __name__: maybe he meant disclosing
10:38  cablop: my old setup is, i carry two usb, plug one with the decrypter, and plug the other and read... willing to move to just one usb, to carry the decrypter and open the container
10:38  cablop: i mean not losing the information, not the device
10:38  Psi-Jack-: cablop: And how big is the actual CONTENTS of said encryption container?
10:39  cablop: if the device is lost it doesn't matter as long as information was not easy to read by a third party
10:39  Psi-Jack-: cablop: Same story, same respons, dumbfounding, to loosing the information and/or device. :p
10:39  cablop: contents above 4 gb
10:39 * Psi-Jack- widens an eye.
10:39  cablop: awww
10:40  digitalstimulus: largest single file > 4 GB?
10:40  Psi-Jack-: That's a pretty large piece of data for just passwords.
10:40  cablop: i mean if somebody stole it to read our passwords he can't because he needs to unencrypt the unit
10:40  Psi-Jack-: I mean, seriously, 4GB of passwords?
10:40  cablop: not only passwords... i said also work stuff
10:40  __name__: Psi-Jack-: depends on the strength and amount of passwords
10:41  cablop: documents, logs and so on
10:41  Psi-Jack-: cablop: Heh, well, make two, or three encryption containers and store them all on the same device.
10:41  __name__: if it is a lot of strong gpg or ssh keys..
10:41  cablop: some accounting information and related
10:41  EdwardIII: 'work' stuff - definitely talking about porno
10:41  cablop: LOL
10:42  Psi-Jack-: At just under 2GB each.
10:42  cablop: if it was porno i just solve it with a tar and password xD
10:42  Psi-Jack-: Or!
10:42  Psi-Jack-: Get a device that already encrypts it for you. Like.. What is it... Iron Key?
10:42  lautriv: cablop, anything else could split
10:44  cablop: nah not iron key
10:44  digitalstimulus: multiple files would be my suggestion too, maybe find a way to organize?  one for 4GB password file, one for 4GB of HD 'video content', another for documents?
10:44  cablop: the idea is to have a cheap method for it
10:44  cablop: and already using open source software
10:45  Psi-Jack-: Why not Iron Key?
10:45  Psi-Jack-: They have exacty what you need.
10:45  archeleus: Iron Key looks sexy
10:45  Psi-Jack-: For carrying passwords, ACCOUNTING data, etc etc etc.. All the stuff you mentioned, you should stop beings tupid and get real stuff.
10:45  cablop: let me check it
10:45  lautriv: cablop, will you tell us this is a DB about 6G ?
10:46  cablop: noooo
10:46  cablop: lol
10:46  lautriv: then you can split
10:46  archeleus: Talking about security
10:46  knubbze: build a device that engraves the binary data into a layer of mold, store in a cool area that prevents mold from growing further
10:46  cablop: ok, i use truecrypt, so i just mount a container as another disk
10:46  knubbze: if device gets stolen, mold will grow and render the data unusable
10:46  archeleus: Are SSH connections blockable?
10:47  mrcarrot: archeleus: of course they are...
10:47  lautriv: archeleus, in what sense ?
10:47  cablop: it has inside some software to run in windows, like a custom firefox, some accounting software a password manager, a portable openoffice, an application with nothes and a folder with many many work things, like some database backups
10:47  mrcarrot: archeleus: any decent firewall can block them
10:47  knubbze: any decent?
10:47  archeleus: Well I was reading about the great firewall (chinese) and people easily bypass 'em via tunnels
10:48  archeleus: So if they're anal about censorship, why allow?
10:48  knubbze: if a firewall/packet filter wasn't able to filter anything on any port it wouldn't even qualify as one
10:48  rosco: someone already tested xcat for cluster administration ? I've seen very few results on google.
10:48  digitalstimulus: cablop, is it necessary to encrypt the openoffice and other applications?
10:49  cablop: firefox and thunderbird for sure, they tend to store many information, like forms data or passwords or emails
10:51  digitalstimulus: my thinking is convenience and security don't go well together.  look at the airports in the US...
10:51  cablop: yes...
10:51  mrcarrot: cablop: i really wonder why at all you need carry around a such amount of data? even if it is encrypted, it is best to leave it at the office.
10:51  knubbze: firewalls can't be used for censorship anyway; IPs blocked? -> use tunnels; payload-specific blocks? -> use SSL; SSL blocked? -> have fun getting your CC# stolen during transactions
10:51  knubbze: so if china really wants censorship; they must cut themselves off from the internet and establish a chinternet
10:52  jelly: knubbze: it's already done.
10:52  cablop: the simpliest setup was to encrypt the whole usb, but to carry two usb... then not easy, to split the contaner just brings me baclk to the old setup but ""virtualized, hehe
10:52  knubbze: china is establishing a national WAN?
10:52  archeleus: knubbze: I think china is like a huge intranet anyway
10:52  cablop: awww
10:52  cablop: China just ask the isp providers to block some websites
10:53  knubbze: yeah that's what I thought
10:53  cablop: and test those isp from time to time
10:53  cablop: it is theeasiest way to censorship
10:53  cablop: you ask the isp to do the hard job, if they don't you revoke their licenses
10:53  knubbze: how can ISPs even technically ``block'' a website
10:54  cablop: blocking its ips?
10:54  knubbze: hi@ tunnels
10:54  knubbze: also have fun when IPv6 becomes really widespread
10:54  archeleus: Tunnels are great
10:54  mrcarrot: i am using tunnels a lot.. really nice things
10:54  mrcarrot: ssh tunnels
10:54  knubbze: one website might be accessible via literally thousands of different IPs in different subnets
10:55  cablop: well, this is a problem of the isp provider
10:55  cablop: as said before, is the easiest way to censorship, :P
10:55  knubbze: yeah I can't see how an ISP could effectively establish a website-specific blocking policy
10:55  digitalstimulus: bah, I used ssh to reboot my RAID5 server and I have a feeling that it's in initramfs busy box shell again...
10:55  knubbze: at least with a blacklist approach
10:55  mrcarrot: knubbze: easily done... block the access to outside dns. let not allowed pages be directed to a warning site instead. nobody really surfs by ip, they do it by names
10:55  cablop: or just ban the website url from the dns servers... and so on
10:56  digitalstimulus: this server is just being annoying
10:56  knubbze: well, in that case some gureilla chinese would just establish their own DNS servers
10:56  cablop: well, afaik you can suf with no problem in hongkong
10:57  cablop: yes they can... it is just not legal
10:57  knubbze: imho the only semi-efficient way to block websites is to refuse routing to ANY non-chinese IPs, etc. and then establish a whitelist of allowed IPs
10:57  cablop: but for the majority it is a simple solution for a country as big as china is
10:58  cablop: they do via blacklist
10:58  cablop: and laws
10:58  knubbze: yeah, as I said, blacklists won't do much; maybe the majority is pacified but somebody who really desperately WANTS this info
10:58  knubbze: is going to get it
10:58  cablop: google works there, but can't provide some results in a search
10:59  cablop: myspace has its own version, and so on
10:59  knubbze: that's just the coöperations coöperating
10:59  digitalstimulus: I don't want to zero the superblock, I lack the storage to rebuild the array if something goes bad :(
11:00  cablop: well, the fat with smaller containers inside seems to be the way to go
11:01  knubbze: i just googled on google.cn for `mao tse tung kills people for fun'; it yielded 17k results
11:01  knubbze: on google.com it yielded 4.39 million
11:02  cablop: in myspace for china you cannot post a thing if certain words are in your post
11:02  cablop: like dalai or lama or tiananmen...
11:02  Psi-Jack-: And this is important to ##linux why?
11:02  knubbze: cablop: lol
11:03  knubbze: curiously enough googling `dalai lama' on .cn yields 12M results, on .com it yields 7M
11:03  cablop: well cause linux is fredom xD
11:03  cablop: well go and see how much of those results came from the news
11:03  cablop: and then guess who manages the news
11:03  cablop: :P
11:03  archeleus: never knew china was against dalai lama
11:03  cablop: anywat
11:03  cablop: this is OT
11:03  Psi-Jack-: China's business is China's business.
11:04  cablop: but knubbze just as a sidenote, the most common word in maccain website was obama... xD
11:04  knubbze: lol
11:04  knubbze: lol, dalailama has a fking twitter account?
11:05  cablop: i knews those mantras in my email were from the real one!!! sigh i didn't resent them xD
11:05  archeleus: heh even kim jong II has a website now
11:06  cablop: well, just tested
11:06  knubbze: By developing a sense of concern for others' well-being, then no matter what others' attitudes are, you can keep inner peace.
11:06  knubbze: 2:48 AM Nov 20th via web
11:06  knubbze: true words
11:06  cablop: plugged the usb in ntfs, started to copy an mp3, unplugged while busy
11:06  cablop: replugged and see that the linux mounted it... no trace of the mp3...
11:08  cablop: so i bet an eror like power source error, or unpluging the usb without umounting the container just will give me more headaches..
11:10  Psi-Jack-: Two words: Iron Key
11:11  cablop: yes
11:11  cablop: it seems to be the solution
11:11  cablop: if it works with linux
11:12  lautriv: cablop, removing any drive without flush is always a bad idea regardless of the kind of device.
11:13  cablop: yep, but one thing is to corrupt a file, and another to corrupt all your stuff xD
11:14  lautriv: cablop, maybe you should have some linux on the stick and use a decent FS :D
11:16  cablop: hehe
11:16  cablop: mmm
11:16  cablop: that brings me to another question
11:17  cablop: are there some firefox and thunderbird portable versions for linux?
11:17  cablop: defining pottable as software that runs on the stick leaving no trace in the host computer
11:18  vinleod: cablop: you could probably get something like that by building them staticly
11:18  lautriv: cablop, if you run from stick, what should leave a trace ?
11:19  EugenA: do you know any software for linux for transliteration?
11:20  cablop: in windows some programs leave things on the registry, temp folder or creating stuff in the users directory
11:20  cablop: in linux some aps by default create hidden folders in home
11:20  cablop: like .mozilla
11:21  lautriv: cablop, /home/someone/.mozilla has to be on the stick
11:22  cablop: o.O how in the stick?
11:22  lautriv: either boot linux from there or virtualize one
11:23  cablop: ah
11:23  cablop: this is not like the definition
11:23  Gorroth: installing the android SDK
11:23  supe: How do I combine an .acc and a .h264 extracted from a MKV into an AVI?
11:23  Gorroth: i bet this little netbook is gonna have lots of "fun" trying to run eclipse and the simulator
11:23  cablop: for example, the firefox portable version just run from inside the usb, using a profile in the usb, when you turn off the firefox unplug the usb and plug in another computer it continues using the same profile on usb
11:24  cablop: you don't need to turn off any other computer OS, not modify it, and you don't leave your info elsewhere
11:24  cablop: this is the purpose
11:24  kish_: im installing openbsd
11:24  supe: #openBSD
11:24  supe: :P
11:24  kish_: hopefully kernel updates will be much less frequent
11:25  kish_: i had a 30 day uptime on my ubuntu box until the battery ran out
11:25  lautriv: Gorroth, 300M for an empty window an 5 minutes to find it's own ass on 127.0.0.1 doesn't count as "fun"
11:25  kish_: then i also updates the kernel
11:25  kish_: wait, i jhavent updates the kernel
11:25  kish_: need to reboot for that
11:26  kish_: maybe i should ksplice
11:27  Gorroth: lautriv: hmm, i think that is precisely what "fun" means (with quotes)
11:27  cablop: Psi-Jack you can check truecrypt and see a cheaper alternative to Iron Key
11:28  lautriv: Gorroth, place this thingie in a fridge while unsing eclipse :D
11:29  Gorroth: lautriv: don't worry; i'll be keeping it away from my genitals :)
11:29  Psi-Jack-: cablop: Cheap isn't in question here.
11:29  Psi-Jack-: Sensative material, and portability, is.
11:29  Gorroth: the TSA, on the other hand, i'm not so sure about.  i wonder if they'd get really suspicious if i sent my netbook through the scanner and it was really hot
11:29  kish_: what does the tsa do with your laptop behind closed doors
11:30  Psi-Jack-: Gorroth: Careful now, they'll feel you up for that one!
11:30  Psi-Jack-: Full cavity search, even.
11:31  Gorroth: i can only hope
11:31  Psi-Jack-: Personally, on that topic: I'm completely pissed with what the TSA is doing.
11:31  Gorroth: when they start giving out cavity searches, i'm going to start heading to the airport without a boarding pass, just for the free rub downs
11:31  Gorroth: kish_: i don't even wanna know
11:32  kish_: my netbook should be wrapped safely inside a towel coated with tinfoil
11:32  kish_: let them see through that
11:33  cablop: tinfoil?
11:33  kish_: its what people wrap their heads with
11:34  cablop: ah
11:34  lautriv: at least ppl like kish_
11:34  Gorroth: kish_: careful there.  that's bomb making material!
11:34  Gorroth: at least, that's what they'll say
11:35  cablop: mmm i hate this pulseaudio thing
11:36  Psi-Jack-: PulseAudio is the epidomy of bad audio in Linux right now.
11:37  lautriv: i doubt any decent distro uses it.
11:37  Gorroth: wtf is PulseAudio (i use OS X most of the time)
11:37  kish_: it makes music sound worse?
11:37  kish_: should i put a drop rule before or after amasquerade rule
11:38  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: OpenSUSE (can), Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.
11:38  lautriv: Psi-Jack not per default on debian.
11:38  Psi-Jack-: lautriv: Look at Debian 6.
11:39  lautriv: Psi-Jack i AM on 6
11:39  Psi-Jack-: No you're not, it's not out yet. ;)
11:40  lautriv: Psi-Jack the stamp v6 and it's own keys are out since about 3 month.
11:40  kish_: geepeegee key?
11:42  sinthetek: i just notcied that on my router it lists 'ubuntu' as a dhcp client
11:45  lautriv: sinthetek, was this a question ?
11:45  sinthetek: just curious why this is, /etc/hostname reflects the name i set for it, network manager shouldn't be using dhcp and my current ip is the one i set to be static
11:45  sinthetek: (which is also well below the dhcp server 'start range')
11:45  sinthetek: so, if the system isn't using dhcp, where is the router getting this 'ubuntu' hostname?
11:45  lautriv: sinthetek, same subnet, did an arp. you'll find the MAC of your NIC.
11:46  sinthetek: not really a problem, just seems a bit anomalous so i was curious
11:46  lautriv: sinthetek, or you have a long lease from initial install
11:46  sinthetek: hmm... so my arp responses are indicating the hostname is ubuntu? that makes sense
11:47  JohnnyL: How does one build Theron under Linux? I'm having trouble linking the boost threads lib. I tried .so and .a... Do I need to compile the boost threads somehow to a .lib?
11:48  Zharf: do I need X server on a server to run X programs through ssh/x-forwarding on it or can it utilize local X server?
11:48  Zharf: or is there a minimal set of things I need to install without the actual server...
11:48  lautriv: JohnnyL, probably just a forhotten link-path ?
11:49  lautriv: *gotten
11:49  mrcarrot: Zharf: no, but the xlibs you need
11:49  Zharf: ok
11:49  mrcarrot: Zharf: and those will be installed as dependency in most distros
11:50  JohnnyL: Lautriv: no I include it specifically in the makefile (the makefile wasen't created by me)... I set the include and lib dirs properly.. but just can't get the boost threads linked in.
11:50  Zharf: dependency for what though :)
11:50  mrcarrot: for firefox or whatever you install on the server
11:50  JohnnyL: Zharf: the dependency on boost threads.
11:52  Skyscraper: does anyone know an very small terminal based linux server... i need only basics + networking+perl ... should save energy!!
11:52  Skyscraper: for Atom N270
11:53  Skyscraper: +LAMP
11:53  lautriv: Skyscraper, any without desktop
11:53  karthee: Skyscraper:  any distribution install the 'minimal' version ..
11:54  lolcat: How can I check if there are any open incoming ports?
11:54  nicola_pav: how can i run multiple exec in find
11:54  nicola_pav: i want to convert files and delete the original in find
11:54  karthee: nicola_pav: -exec command1 -exec command2 -exec command3 ..
11:54  lautriv: lolcat, open in the sense of relatet or listening or unblocked ?
11:55  karthee: lolcat: netstat -lnp
11:55  lolcat: lautriv: Unblocked
11:56  lautriv: lolcat, look at karthee or nmap yourself
11:56  lolcat: nmap -l 193.157.234.15 ?
11:56  nicola_pav: karthee: all syntax?
11:57  nicola_pav: karthee: found it
11:57  nicola_pav: thanks
11:57  karthee: np
11:57  loomsen: nicola_pav: i use to pipe it to a while loop or something if it gets more complex: find . -type f | while read i; do something with $i; done
11:58  nicola_pav: loomsen: this is safer u think?
11:58  JohnnyL: what do programmer's use for c++ multicore capable apps?
11:58  karthee: loomsen:  instead you can use -c bash  ...
11:58  loomsen: karthee: oh nice
11:59  karthee: loomsen: isnt it better to avoid loop when you can do it on the fly .
11:59  loomsen: karthee: didnt think about that, i agree
11:59  karthee: :-)
11:59  lolcat: nmap, can it tell all open ports, or just the ones with a server runing?
12:00  karthee: lolcat: if the server is not running then whats the point in checking if its open or not ?
12:01  lolcat: karthee: I need to know what port to run the server on
12:03  lolcat: No poin in running a server nobody will see
12:03  lautriv: lolcat, you should choose a port matching IANA rules or is this some custom thingie ?
12:03  lolcat: IANA rules?
12:03  lolcat: It is a university, I have no idea if any ports are open.
12:04  lautriv: lolcat, then don't nmap but ask the admin.
12:04  karthee: lolcat: check your firewall .. if the port is open or not ..
12:05  lolcat: lautriv: Sounds logic
12:06  kish: http://pastebin.com/Rp79yqGZ
12:06  kish: whats wrong with that
12:06  karthick87: I want to have more than one user logged on at the same time, on the same computer.Each user should have a full GUI X session...Any idea??
12:06  rosco: lolcat: and you expose yourself to being blacklisted for the nmap.
12:06  kish: iptables btw
12:06  lolcat: rosco: Blacklisted from what?
12:06  lolcat: I am using a vps to nmap
12:07  kish: who be getting nmapped
12:07  lolcat: My computer
12:07  koala_man: karthick87: with their own monitor/keyboard?
12:07  karthick87: koala_man: yep
12:07  lolcat: I think I am running to x sessions
12:07  rosco: lolcat: I mean some servers detects that they are scanned and automatically put the source address in a blacklist.
12:08  koala_man: karthick87: it's known as multiseat. try googling "multiseat X"
12:08  crocket: Hmm
12:08  lolcat: rosco: I hope my ubuntu dont
12:08  Kingsy: how are programs managed in linux if you want them to boot on startup? is there a file that handles it?
12:08  karthee: karthick87: use the ssh's X forwarding capability ..
12:09  nicola_pav: when i run lame test.wav
12:09  lolcat: Kingsy: Daemons
12:09  nicola_pav: i will get test.wav.mp3
12:09  nicola_pav: i want to get only test.mp3
12:09  mrcarrot: Kingsy: do you mean for your own log in or for the whole system?
12:09  nicola_pav: how can i do that?
12:09  loomsen: Kingsy: google: "linux runlevels" and "linux init system"
12:09  crocket: RAID 1 is Mirroring without parity or striping. Does this fact make RAID1 not very much more stable than no RAID?
12:09  Kingsy: mrcarrot - for both I guess
12:09  rosco: kingsy: Services are stored in /etc/init.d of some sort, depending on the distribution
12:10  mrcarrot: Kingsy: services or "real programs"
12:10  karthee: Kingsy:  chkconfig 'servicename'
12:10  koala_man: crocket: with raid1, each of the two disks can die with no loss of data
12:11  karthick87: karthee: can you explain me?
12:11  crocket: koala_man, nothing more?
12:11  rosco: kingsy: When it comes to graphical interface, it's all dependant of the environemnt you choose. You should mention your distribution.
12:11  Kingsy: yea I know you can start an app with /etc/init.d/APPNAME start  but I don't wanna have to do that everytime I boot
12:11  loomsen: Kingsy: chkconfig foo on
12:11  koala_man: crocket: well, no. that's the maximum redundancy you can have with two disks.
12:11  Kingsy: rosco - yea I was looking to understand it through the console
12:11  karthee: ssh -X 'machineYouWantToShare' ....    if you want to start firefox   do ./firefox ...
12:11  crocket: koala_man, How about three disks?
12:11  ecolitan: I have a XEN virtual machine, with its disk mounted via nfs. Just how dangerous is it to export the nfs share with async? The performance is so much better with async
12:12  eviltoaster: How do i measure trunk speed?
12:12  rosco: kingsy: the boot procedure is heavily dependant on your distribution.
12:12  koala_man: crocket: that's not generally possible
12:13  Kingsy: rosco - ah ok ..
12:13  crocket: koala_man, Are RAID 2-6 more stable than RAID1?
12:13  eviltoaster: How do i measure trunk speed? does balance-rr give me 4gb or only 1gb but load balancing?
12:13  crocket: They employ parity
12:14  lautriv: crocket, RAID is about redundancy, not stability
12:14  rosco: TBH, I've never had stability problem on RAID1.
12:14  crocket: lautriv : What can I employ for stability?
12:15  crocket: redundancy is not enough
12:15  koala_man: crocket: you don't need parity when you have mirroring. for the case of two disks, parity and mirroring is pretty much the same thing
12:15  lautriv: crocket, do some HA
12:15  vandemar: crocket: redundant san with multipath?
12:15  crocket: HA?
12:15  koala_man: high availability
12:16  lautriv: crocket, HighAvilability or in other words raid for machines
12:16  vandemar: crocket: what are you actually trying to do?  you're asking a bunch of strange questions and not understanding the answers
12:16  cousin_mario: hello
12:16  cousin_mario: http://pastebin.com/pTWSY45n <- serial remains 01 in the generated certificate, what is it I'm doing 'rong?
12:16  crocket: I want to build a file server that serves data for my computers.
12:16  crocket: It can't lose data since it will contain my most important data.
12:16  vandemar: crocket: budget?
12:16  crocket: I already bought it
12:16  crocket: I'm waiting for delivery
12:17  rosco: crocket: check drbd in google
12:17  crocket: I bought 2 2TB hard drives with low power consumption
12:17  crocket: The case is miniITX
12:17  crocket: It was difficult to find a miniITX case that can house 2 hard drives.
12:17  vandemar: you have 2 TB of "most important" data?
12:18  rosco: crocket: first thing, you should have bought more disks than just 2, where are the spares ?
12:18  karthick87: koala_man: wat abt gdmflexiserver?
12:18  crocket: "DRBD® refers to block devices designed as a building block to form high availability (HA) clusters."
12:18  crocket: rosco : 3?
12:19  crocket: vandemar, redundant san with multipath?
12:19  karthee: karthick87: install vnc
12:19  rosco: crocket: 3 = 2 + 1 spare for live reconstruction, but you must also have 1 in stock in case of emergency -> 4
12:19  koollman: crocket: if you don't want to lose data, make backups.
12:19  vandemar: crocket: accept the fact that there's a small chance the box will blow up, use raid 1, and back up any critical data to a usb flash drive
12:19  koollman: raid helps to mitigates disk failures
12:19  koollman: but there are many other ways to lose data
12:19  eviltoaster: How do i measure trunk speed? does balance-rr give me 4gb throughput or only 1gb and load balancing?
12:20  crocket: vandemar : a usb flash drive is not large enough to house hundreds of gigabytes.
12:20  rosco: crocket: but with miniITX, live reconstruction by spare drive is gone, so just install a light linux distro with raid1 and monitoring and you will be ready to go. Do you have many IO ?
12:20  crocket: To house 3~4 hard drives, I need to buy a middle tower case.
12:20  vandemar: crocket: if you have hundreds of gigabytes of critical data, you need a better solution than a ghetto atx box with two commodity disks
12:20  crocket: rosco : I don't have much IO.
12:21  gordboy: vandemar: i bet it's vital nucleotide sequencing data for the human genome project. and he wants some advice about backup
12:22  crocket: I never experienced a disk failure except when I repeatedly took out a usb flash drive without unmounting it or safely removing it.
12:22  crocket: I was not alert about it
12:22  crocket: But it could happen in the next 10 years.
12:22  crocket: I've played with PCs only for 12 years
12:23  rosco: in a mini-ITX, heat is your enemy. As well as weak power supply.
12:23  crocket: rosco : heat and power are dealt with.
12:23  koollman: crocket: and backups ?
12:23  crocket: I'm not very confident with backups since RAID1 has a possibility of failing.
12:23  koollman: crocket: raid isn't backups
12:24  crocket: RAID1 seems to be single backup.
12:24  JohnnyL: koala_man: do you watch Ugly Americans?
12:24  koollman: crocket: backup : a copy of your data, not stored at the same place as the data. And that you can restore if you lose the data
12:24  crocket: ok
12:24  nicola_pav: anyone familiar with lame?
12:24  mrcarrot: crocket: i would not use 1Tb disks... they are failing more often than a bit smaller when the byte density is so high..
12:24  koollman: crocket: you have raid1, you remove all your files, you lost your data. you get some filesystem corruption, you lost your data. your hardware burns, you lost your data...
12:25  koollman: :)
12:25  nicola_pav: i need help in the naming
12:25  koollman: mrcarrot: it's less and less true.
12:25  crocket: mrcarrot, I use 2TB.
12:25  gordboy: nicola_pav: ask your question
12:25  crocket: I heard 2TB drives were more stable than 1TB drives.
12:25  gordboy: oh man
12:25  nicola_pav: gordboy: when i run: lame test.wav
12:25  nicola_pav: it will generate a file named test.wav.mp3
12:25  nicola_pav: i just want test.mp3
12:26  vandemar: rosco: if it's absolute critical data, get two external 2-disk enclosures, get two more disks, and use raid-1 over all four.  that way you can lose 3 disks or one entire enclosure.  but it still won't help if north korea nukes your house
12:26  crocket: koollman : how do you back up?
12:26  gordboy: nicola_pav: name the output file too. just like it says in the man page - lame test.wav test.mp3
12:26  karthick87: how to install gdm flexiserver?
12:27  rosco: vandemar: with 4 disks, and 2 enclosure, I would go with rsnapshot directly.
12:27  crocket: vandemar : nothing can stop bullets.
12:27  nicola_pav: i am doing this in a script file
12:27  nicola_pav: in a for loop
12:27  koollman: crocket: make a copy (or more) of your files, on some other system. another file server, for example, or some online storage, or tapes, or something
12:27  mrcarrot: there is very likely that i am going to end up making a file server for backup purpose for a customer. it will probably run openbsd :)
12:27  crocket: koollman : just another drive that I connect to the server occasionally?
12:27  mrcarrot: s/there/is
12:27  gordboy: nicola_pav: so use shell parameter expansion
12:28  koollman: crocket: that's one solution, yes
12:28  koollman: probably one of the cheapest ones
12:28  vandemar: crocket: if you don't need up-to-the-second integrity, just back up to a third disk once a day or week and keep that off-site.
12:28  crocket: vandemar : That seems fair enough.
12:28  rosco: survey: who thinks Crocket is building a pr0n host ?
12:29  crocket: what?
12:29  zjblabs: How can I do a recursive directory listing and see what subdirectory each filesystem object is in?
12:29  badcloud: rosco: hahahaha
12:29  crocket: I didn't tell about porn
12:29  nicola_pav: gordboy can u explain mor?
12:29  karthee: zjblabs: find -type f  .. or ls -R
12:30  gordboy: nicola_pav: for f in *.wav ; do lame "$f" "${f%.*}.mp3" ; done
12:30  Kingsy: ok different question, if I wanted to change from a dynamic to a static IP address how would I go about that?
12:30  vandemar: Kingsy: depends on your distro
12:30  Kingsy: ah.. np
12:30  marduk: hi
12:30  vandemar: Kingsy: generally in modern gui distros there will be a gui configuration thingy for networking
12:31  gordboy: nicola_pav: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Parameters#Parameter_Expansion
12:31  crocket: I wouldn't pay 650usd to safely guard porns.
12:31  marduk: :S
12:32  nicola_pav: gordboy: thanks a lot
12:32  crocket: It's a significant amount of money for poor people like me.
12:32  nicola_pav: i am reading now
12:32  vandemar: for 650 you could have gotten an external sata enclosure
12:32  vandemar: plus more than 2 disks
12:32  gordboy: crocket: are you the sysadmin for hotmail by any chance ?
12:32  mrcarrot: crocket: i once saw a very intersting script for backuping stuff... with it you could go back in history. for each time it made backup it created the folder structure and made hard links from the last backup for those files that had not changed. then it rsynced those that had changed.
12:32  crocket: no
12:32  crocket: gordboy : no
12:32  vandemar: mine is 6TB raid-6 (5-disk) and cost about that
12:33  marduk: for 650 you could have gotten the real thing
12:33  zjblabs: Thanks karthee
12:33  rosco: mrcarrot: rsnapshot
12:33  gordboy: crocket: funny. cos you are every bit as dumb
12:33  crocket: I was going to use rsnapshot.
12:33  nicesj: Hello
12:33  crocket: gordboy : what?
12:33  nicesj: What is the mean of '+' in the 'gtk+'?
12:33  nicesj: Why the gtk project added '+' sign on its name?
12:34  scorp007: probably the C++ binding.
12:34  scorp007: vs the regular C one.
12:34  Zharf: nope
12:34  marduk: no
12:34  gordboy: nicesj: it just means "a bit more, but not as ridiculous as c++, compared to c"
12:34  Zharf: c++ bindings is gtkmm
12:35  marduk: it was more like a newer version of gtk.. anyway stupid name
12:35  gordboy: nicesj: in other words, it is just a shorthand way of saying : look ! we made it better
12:35  mrcarrot: yeah, rsnapshot does the same as that script :)
12:35  marduk: but i guess tey're stuck with it now
12:36  marduk: yeah and the reason why gtkmm is called gtkmm because gtk+++ would have been even dumber
12:37  gordboy: maybe you should bracket those + for clarity ...
12:37  nicesj: Someone comes to me to ask it... now I can send him away from me ... haha
12:38  nicesj: Thanks ;)
12:38  mrcarrot: crocket: will you use nfs on the backup-server?
12:38  crocket: mrcarrot, nfs or CIFS
12:38  crocket: I currently use NFS to share my desktop data with my laptop.
12:38  mrcarrot: with nfs you get at least filepermissions in your backup
12:39  crocket: NFS is difficult to manage.
12:39  crocket: I have to make a list of permitted hosts.
12:39  crocket: If I don't have a domain name, I would have to change the content of /etc/exports whenever I get a new IP.
12:40  Psi-Jack-: NFS is easy, it's fault tolerant NFS that's next to impossible to maintain because of it's purely bad approaches to doing so.
12:40  crocket: And when I get a domain name, ssh attackers easily find me and annoy me.
12:40  kish: any reason why these iptbles should block the intended tunneling http://pastebin.com/Rp79yqGZ
12:40  crocket: It's a dilemma.
12:40  karthee: crocket: instead you can add it in /etc/hosts and change it in /etc/hosts if ip changes ..
12:40  mrcarrot: crocket: or then you have a router for your home :)
12:40  nicesj: how about use the '/etc/hosts' file to maintain you IP as a private dns?
12:40  vandemar: crocket: why would you use dynamic global ips for nfs connections?
12:40  koollman: crocket: use a vpn, make the laptop part of your 'local network'
12:41  crocket: koollman, That's a way
12:41  gordboy: they should invent a plug-n-play nfs. and while they are at it, make it fast enough for daily use
12:41  crocket: vandemar, I don't want to pay for a static IP.
12:41  Psi-Jack-: gordboy: NFSv4 is fast.
12:41  vandemar: crocket: use private IPs
12:41  nicesj: crocket / if you decide to use the 'vpn', you can use samba too
12:41  koollman: crocket: it will also avoid having your data going over the internet unencrypted :)
12:41  crocket: Is samba available only in a private network?
12:41  nicesj: I think, samba is better safe one than nfs
12:42  kish: crocket, dont listen to these jealous pricks!
12:42  nicesj: crocket / sometimes, ISP blocking the SAMBA port
12:42  Psi-Jack-: VPN is the way to go, actually.
12:42  nicesj: Because of the worm...
12:42  nicesj: So I uses VPN to make a connection of samba..
12:42  kish: how do you uses vpn
12:42  Psi-Jack-: Which makes EVERYTHING TRAVEL THROUGH THE VPN TUNNEL, hence, so, nicesj's suggestive hints completely invalid.
12:43  nicesj: openvpn I uses
12:43  Psi-Jack-: Oh nevermind. ;)
12:43  rosco: make it simple, use ssh and rsync. Or directly an rsync server.
12:43  nicesj: psi-jack- / Nope, not the everything.
12:43  crocket: samba didn't work out of private networks in my experience.
12:43  Psi-Jack-: nicesj: Everytyhing.
12:43  kish: Im also trying to get vpn working again http://pastebin.com/Rp79yqGZ
12:43  gordboy: Psi-Jack: i remember the bad old days of nfs. it was quicker to burn a cd and walk. but, yeah vpn sounds like the best plan so far
12:43  nicesj: psi-jack- / If we enable the vpn, we will get 2 interfaces
12:43  nicesj: psi-jack- / and 2 IPs
12:43  koollman: gordboy: nfs isn't slow.
12:43  Psi-Jack-: nicesj: If you tell openvpn to push the new route through, /everything/ goes through it.
12:43  functor: I am trying to pipe grep and then count how many instances of a word per grep line, what program do I use for the count bit?
12:43  koollman: gordboy: not on any modern network anyway
12:44  crocket: VPN via ssh?
12:44  Psi-Jack-: crocket: Die
12:44  kish: nc was slower than rsync for fiel tranfers
12:44  nicesj: psi-jack- / yean, but you already mentioend, 'If you tell openvpn to push the new route through...'
12:44  koollman: gordboy: sure, if you have nfs over 56k lossy link, you shouldn't expect much. But on a gigabit network, it's usually fast enough
12:44  nicesj: psi-jack- / so if you didn't do it, it will not.
12:44  Psi-Jack-: Right. :)
12:44  nicesj: But,. To use VPN, we have to get some performance lossy.
12:45  crocket: some performance loss entails VPN?
12:45  nicesj: transfer rate
12:45  koollman: well, you have to encapsulate the packets. you get a bit less bandwidth. and you have to encrypt them, so you need a bit more cpu
12:45  nicesj: because VPN will capsulate normal packet with some encryption information.
12:46  nicesj: so every packet which are passed through the VPN, should be de-capsulated...
12:46 --- kish is now known as nothingworks
12:46  nicesj: it will take more time to get original data...
12:46  crocket: To be in a private network means to link server and other computers with a router or to make the server a router.
12:46  marduk: :S
12:46  crocket: Do you guys like running a computer as a router?
12:47  gordboy: crocket: so you don't work for the human genome project. nor hotmail. so that vital data must be the new tsa pat-down regulations ?
12:47  nicesj: crocket / basically, every PC will do routing
12:47  crocket: nicesj : ok
12:47  crocket: gordboy : it's for my personal purpose
12:48  crocket: I just have a tendency to protect my properties.
12:48  marduk: :S
12:48  rosco: I see no reason to use anything else than ssh. Every for remote deskktop you can use NX which rely only on ssh. And for file backup you have rsync. I have to test sshfs for file server, but I guess you can have a decent solution only with ssh.
12:49  rosco: (typo, time to take a break...)
12:49  nicesj: sshfs is a good one to share files ;)
12:49  crocket: nicesj : Is it reasonable to make the server a gateway?
12:49  EdwardIII: hmm bit of an odd issue here
12:49  EdwardIII: hey, i just had an sshfs question!
12:49  mrcarrot: rosco: i use ssh for most things... but to backup a big share of files, ssh is a bit slow
12:49  nicesj: crocket / if you want gathering packets to analyze them.
12:50  crocket: nicesj : I'm sick of my old router.
12:50  aditya: hey, can someone tell me where can I get the current status about the functions and structures about network programming on Linux? Which are obsolete and which are the new 'standard'
12:50  nicesj: crocket / 'honeynet' is an example of it
12:50  EdwardIII: i want to do rsync backups onto an sshfs share - but the sshfs share doesn't preserve ownership (it changes the ownership for all files to whatever is specified at mount time)
12:50  lautriv: crocket, is this server between different subnets ?
12:50  crocket: lautriv : What do you mean?
12:50  crocket: lautriv : Does it have two IPs?
12:50  lautriv: crocket, how much networks are in the server reflected ?
12:51  crocket: lautriv : localhost, internet connection, and a private network.
12:51  crocket: oops
12:51  crocket: s/localhost/loopback network/
12:51  marduk: EdwardIII: you have to mount it as root and pass the.. preserve permission option or whatever it's called
12:52  lautriv: crocket, and the internet-site is direct connected ?
12:52  lautriv: *side
12:52  crocket: lautriv : the hardwares for my server is being delivered.
12:52  gordboy: lautriv: you were right the first time
12:52  crocket: Currently my router is directly connectec to the internet.
12:53  crocket: *connected
12:53  lautriv: crocket, let me ask another way......is this server direct attached to an official IP where the others must connect to?
12:53  crocket: I plan to do so.
12:53  EdwardIII: marduk, that's the option i can't find
12:54  lautriv: crocket, then and only then it makes sense to make it a gateway.
12:54  crocket: My server may replace my router.
12:54  crocket: I haven't decided yet.
12:54  marduk: EdwardIII: btb why are you using rsync over sshfs when you can just rsync over ssh
12:54  crocket: I could buy a new 802.11n router or I just use the server as a gateway.
12:55  vandemar: rt-n16 is good
12:55  EdwardIII: marduk, kind of a long story - it's a backup from cpanel that has built-in packaging tools
12:55  nicesj: building router using your server will make you happy
12:55  vandemar: I'm thinking about getting one to replace my aging wrt54
12:55  crocket: But to save money, I just use the server as a gateway.
12:55  EdwardIII: marduk, and it doesn't support that, so i'm trying to work around
12:56  marduk: EdwardIII: i don't know what cpanel is
12:56  crocket: nicesj : how so?
12:56  marduk: anyway nm
12:56  EdwardIII: marduk, ultimately it's because i'm using a 3rd party backup tool
12:57  marduk: EdwardIII: don't remember that option. it's been a while since i used sshfs and i never used sshfs as root, actually i don't recomend using ssh[fs] as root
12:58  EdwardIII: marduk, one of my objectives is to preserve ownership - and i think the only way of doing that is as root
12:58  kaushal: hi
12:58  kaushal: is there a way to retain only the last 2 GB of a catalina.out of the total size of 44 GB ?
12:58  rosco: marduk: root is the only way to write a file as someone else than yourself (unless I'm missing something)
12:58  marduk: rosco: yeah, i was refering to the ssh part
12:59  rosco: (to edward in fact.... I really need this break)
12:59  gordboy: marduk: cpanel is used by hosting companies. like bluehost
12:59  EdwardIII: rosco, sure - that's why i'm pretty sure it has to be root at both ends
12:59  marduk: ic
13:00  nicesj: crocket / prepare two more ethernet cards,. and find some info about 'bridge server'
13:00  marduk: kaushal: man tail
13:00  lautriv: kaushal, what kind of data is that ?
13:00  marduk: java crap
13:01  kaushal: lautriv: is it possible using dd command
13:02  lautriv: kaushal, again.........what kind of data is that ?
13:02  marduk: lautriv: text
13:02  kaushal: its text
13:02  marduk: i gave an answer but i guess it wasn't good enough
13:02  lautriv: kaushal, then just tail
13:03  kaushal: lautriv: will be quite slow isnt it
13:04  marduk: kaushal: have yoiu actually tried it?
13:04  lautriv: kaushal, sure, but if one produces 44 G text he has either time or big machines, dd may truncate it if not pure asccii
13:04  kaushal: marduk: any examples
13:05  marduk: kaushal: examples of performance?
13:05  kaushal: examples of dd
13:05  marduk: no
13:05  marduk: anyway i said to use tail
13:05  kaushal: marduk: ok
13:06  marduk: you're already wasting time asking the same question
13:06  kaushal: ok
13:08  nothingw1rks: i really really hate linux
13:08  marduk: me too
13:08  marduk: but hate myself even more, that's why i hang out on ##linux
13:08  lautriv: nothingw1rks, was it too smart for you ?
13:08  jelly: marduk: good work so far!
13:09  nothingw1rks: it was too stupid forme lautriv
13:09  nothingw1rks: i.e. iptables
13:09  nothingw1rks: is a pos
13:10  lautriv: nothingw1rks, what exactly won't work and what distro ?
13:10  nothingw1rks: THIS wont work http://pastebin.com/Rp79yqGZ
13:12  lautriv: nothingw1rks, how ist tun9 attached and what would you get ?
13:12  nothingw1rks: tun9 is the vpn tunnel
13:13  nothingw1rks: i should get forwarded over tun9 when  that rule hits
13:13  toader: Hi, how to close a port?  http://dpaste.com/279816/
13:13  nothingw1rks: eth0 10.0.0.3 accesses google.com and he get's eth0 <--> tun9
13:13  nothingw1rks: butno
13:14  nothingw1rks: the drop rule seems to interfere with it
13:14  nothingw1rks: if i remove the drop rules it works
13:14  nothingw1rks: i have another setup that looks just like that only it works over the 192.168.x.x net and it goes over tun10 <--> tun9
13:15  nothingw1rks: the problem may lie with eth0 being blocked
13:15  nothingw1rks: it doesnt want to take the tun9 route it just gets dropped at eth0
13:15  lautriv: nothingw1rks, why don't you just put the gateway for 10.0.0.3 on the target of the vpn ?
13:15  nothingw1rks: the gateway is 10.0.0.2
13:16  nothingw1rks: those lines are just lan clients who want access to the web over the vpn
13:16  jelly: nothingw1rks: there's a an #iptables channel and a #netfilter channel if you think you have a nontrivial issue
13:16  marduk: seems like a weird way to do vpn
13:16  lautriv: really, looks like
13:17  lautriv: nothingw1rks, you would say 10.0.0.2 is on the other side of the vpn ?
13:17  nothingw1rks: no, 10.0.0.2 runs a lot of vpn tunnels and is the gateway
13:17  nothingw1rks: but 10.0.0.2 also connects to a vpn server as a client        itself
13:18  lautriv: nothingw1rks, and what interface is dedicated to this IP ?
13:18  nothingw1rks: so i need 10.0.0.3+'to hit 10.0.0.2 and then 10.0.0.2 hits the vpn
13:18  nothingw1rks: and it goes in circles after that
13:18  nothingw1rks: lautriv, well, the 10.0.0.0 is on eth0
13:18  SingAlong: is there any window manager lighter than lxde? (i dont need wallpapers etc) i just want to be able to run firefox.
13:19  SingAlong: no wallpapers, no panels, etc
13:19  andip: toader: find out what's listening on that port, and stop it
13:19  nothingw1rks: openbox or fluxbox or windowmaker or that haskell thing
13:19  lautriv: nothingw1rks, you know 10.0.0.0 represents the whole network, in this case a class  A ?
13:19  kwork: SiegeX, pure xorg without windowmaanger?
13:19  SingAlong: nothingw1rks: xmonad (the haskell thing you were referring to)
13:19  nothingw1rks: yes singalong  thats the one
13:19  marduk: SingAlong: i'm guessing by the DE part that lxde is a desktop environment and not just a window manager, so i'd say any window manager is lighter than a desktop environment
13:20  nothingw1rks: lautriv, yes thats why i singled out the ip addresses in the table
13:20  SingAlong: is there a way to find out the amount of ram being used by the system? (just want to know which one's lighter)
13:21  lautriv: nothingw1rks, you can't attach 10.0.0.0 to a single interface without interference.
13:21  SingAlong: marduk: oh! didnt know that window managers can come without a desktop environment. was under the assumption that window managers come on top of desktop environments
13:21  nothingw1rks: lautriv, 10.0.0.0 isnt attached; select ip addresses are
13:22  nothingw1rks: lautriv, and as i said above: if i remove the DROP lines then the whole thing works
13:22  marduk: SingAlong: window managers existed long before so-called desktop environments came to exist
13:22  lautriv: nothingw1rks, i can't follow you, makes no sense.
13:22  nothingw1rks: but i need the DROP lines in case the other vpn goes down so that
13:22  nothingw1rks: lautriv, yeah i suck at explaining these things
13:22  nothingw1rks: but you know what, iptables sucks more
13:24  lautriv: nothingw1rks, they don't. your IPtables were confused like your explanation :D
13:24  nothingw1rks: you should see how i code
13:24  nothingw1rks: at least the compiler always understands me ;)
13:26  nothingw1rks: i lie. i dont know how to code
13:26  nothingw1rks: syntax too confusing
13:26  lautriv: nothingw1rks, make a plan, paste it.
13:33  nicofs: My netbook has an integrated SIM-Modem. I need software to make phone calls (not VoIP). Any Ideas?
13:34 --- JmZ_ is now known as JmZ
13:49  nothingw1rks: nicofs, is it ubuntu?
13:56  b1nd3r: hey folks. I'm having an strange issue with my box. After fixing the date/time in the BIOS my linux stays about 3min trying to boot the system, after that fist boot it never took 3minutes again, anyidea of what can be?
13:57  nothingworks: does this work 10.0.0.3/24
13:57  nothingworks: will iptables actually exclude 10.0.0.1-2 from the rule
13:57  crocket: The motherboard being delivered doesn't support SATA RAID
13:57  crocket: Can I apply software RAID?
13:57  Psi-Jack: That's okay, onboard RAID sucks anyway, it's always fakeraid.
13:58  crocket: Or do I need a RAID hardware?
13:58  Psi-Jack: Of course you can do soft-raid, that's why it's called soft-raid, it's software managed.
13:58  Psi-Jack: It's not as fast, but it's raid.
13:58  crocket: hmm
13:58  crocket: Psi-Jack, There is a problem with software raid
13:59  crocket: RAID1 requires two drives have the same data.
13:59  Psi-Jack: crocket: I use soft-raid on my secondary storage server.
13:59  crocket: If RAID1 is done via operating systems, the second drive wouldn't have the same content as the first initially.
13:59  crocket: The first drive contains the OS.
13:59  Psi-Jack: crocket: It woul once it's synced.
13:59  crocket: hmm
13:59  crocket: didn't know
14:00  crocket: I'd have to expect initial syncing time.
14:00  Psi-Jack: You setup partitions you want exactly identicle in size on two drives, and use that to raid.
14:00  Psi-Jack: I would not advise putting / on soft-raid.
14:00  Psi-Jack: It /can/ be done, but I do not advise it.
14:00  shirtless: anyone wanna compare epeens? I mean, screenshots?
14:00  crocket: Psi-Jack, what happens with / on soft-raid?
14:01  Psi-Jack: shirtless: No.
14:01  shirtless: Psi-Jack, buzzkill
14:01  Psi-Jack: Get drink elsewhere. :p
14:01  Psi-Jack: drunk&
14:01  shirtless: lol, I'm not drinking anything until new years. I have a bet with a guy that I can't do 100 pushups by then
14:01  Psi-Jack: crocket: If the raid fails to initialize during init, it will not boot. Simple as that. heh
14:01  crocket: Oh
14:02  njbair: Hey, I'm wondering if there exists a set of conventions on how to format Linux tutorials. i.e. - when to use monospace, italic, bold, etc.
14:02  crocket: Psi-Jack, Is the probability of RAID failure more than low?
14:02  shirtless: if there is one, it would probably be on tldp.org
14:03  Psi-Jack: What I usually like to do is setup a 200 MB /boot, 40 GB LVM partition, and the rest raid on a 2-drive setup, mirror those onto the secondary drive, in the LVM, make your /, swap, and setup the LVM to mirror to the secondary drive's LVM, then you have mirrored /, and snapshot-capability with lvm.
14:04  Psi-Jack: Oh, and the / being only 16 GB, swap being 4GB, leaving 20 GB for the LVM snapshot.
14:04  crocket: "Hardware implementations also typically support hot swapping, allowing failed drives to be replaced while the system is running."
14:04  crocket: it's cool
14:04  crocket: how swapping
14:04  Psi-Jack: For the swap's you'd have two swap's of 4GB each, and the linux kernel will automagically stripe between the active swap space on both drives on it's own.
14:05  crocket: Psi-Jack, That's an explanation for RAID
14:05  crocket: from wikipedia
14:05  Psi-Jack: It's not just raid. :p
14:08  crocket: Psi-Jack, meaning it needs 8G RAM?
14:10 * Psi-Jack sighs.
14:11  Psi-Jack: Obviously, crocket, you're just not listening to me much at all, are you?
14:11  robinetd: Psi-Jack: Does anyone?
14:11  robinetd: BAZINGA!
14:12  nothingworks: is there a pastebin that doesnt suck
14:12  Psi-Jack: Yes, actually. :p
14:12  nothingworks: wait. nevermind
14:12  Psi-Jack: nothingworks: See topic.
14:12  nothingworks: pastie
14:12  grawity: nothingworks: sprunge.us, and Pastie
14:13  crocket: Psi-Jack, It's difficult to devote my full attention to any one in IRC especially when I switch between IRC and firefox.
14:14  Psi-Jack: crocket: Good, then please stop wasting people's time.
14:15  crocket: Psi-Jack, Can you say that you usually devote your  full attention on IRC?
14:16  Psi-Jack: crocket: I can say, when I'm helping, or asking for help, I will devote my primary attention to the people I'm talking with.
14:16  crocket: Psi-Jack, I just noticed that I missed two of your previous sentences while I was reading about RAID on wikipedia.
14:16  shirtless: Psi-Jack, lighten up eh
14:16  shirtless: it's a holiday ffs
14:16  nothingworks: then why am i working
14:16  Psi-Jack: shirtless: Point? It's a day.
14:17  Psi-Jack: Not everyone's on holiday.
14:17  m1h0: i just joined
14:17  grawity: Hi m1h0.
14:17  shirtless: Psi-Jack, it's not about that, you totally are just being abrasive. you shot me down when i asked to share a screenshot, and now you're torturing this guy for no reason
14:17  Psi-Jack: There's a whole world out there, and only one part of it's celebrating some holiday called Thanksgiving.
14:17  shirtless: I don't care who you are, be nice, please
14:17  m1h0: hey what's up
14:17  Psi-Jack: shirtless: You asked to share epeens.
14:18  shirtless: No, I said "epeens, I mean, screenshots"
14:18  shirtless: it was HUMOR
14:18  m1h0: lol
14:18  Psi-Jack: It's called, inappropriate.
14:18  Psi-Jack: Now, get a shirt.
14:18  shirtless: It's not nearly as inappropriate as your rude attitude.
14:18  m1h0: creepens
14:19  crocket: Psi-Jack, After reading your sentences after mine, it made sense.
14:19  shirtless: With that said... screenshots anyone?
14:20  m1h0: what ?
14:20  robinetd: no thanks.
14:20  lautriv: shirtless, imagebin.ca
14:20  shirtless: why does opera not do any image site correctly
14:21 * shirtless tries a different browser
14:21  crocket: Psi-Jack, You answered about 45 seconds after I asked a question, which is enough time to make me think you were away. So I diverted my attention from IRC. fair?
14:21  robinetd: Because opera is fail.
14:21  Psi-Jack: Perhaps because Opera, as we all know, sucks.
14:21 * robinetd high-fives Psi-Jack.
14:21  m1h0: wth
14:21  shirtless: I tried it because of an advertisement
14:21  Psi-Jack: Epic fail
14:21  shirtless: I had used it like a long time ago and didn't like it. I was giving it another chance
14:21  robinetd: I haven't seen an ad since I started using adblock plus. :D
14:21  lautriv: shirtless, you obey advertisements ?
14:21  Psi-Jack: Congratulations, You've WON!
14:21  m1h0: .
14:21  Psi-Jack: Said the annoying smiley face!
14:22  shirtless: lautriv, advertisements are a way of letting people know about your product.. If it's free, is there any harm?
14:22  shirtless: I'm not opposed to adverts like some of the commies that use linux
14:22  lautriv: shirtless, yes it is munsta-annoying.
14:22  gordboy: opera is latin for "works". and it reminds me of micro$oft works. jack of all trades, master of none
14:22  robinetd: shirtless: It isn't free.
14:22  shirtless: I like adverts, as long as they're not for diet pills
14:22  shirtless: or porn
14:22  nothingworks: that's insane
14:24  shirtless: guys, if you say a billboard for Gentoo Linux on the freeway you'd all be giddy, dont' fool yourselves
14:24  nothingworks: adverts are a crime against humanity
14:24  robinetd: This isn't the freeway.
14:24  m1h0: why the guys from nasa use linux ?
14:24  mrcarrot: long time ago, i was an opera user... it crashed all the time. then somebody started to develop phoenix and i switched
14:24  shirtless: robinetd, that doesn't make any sense
14:24  robinetd: And gentoo likely wouldn't do something flashy and ugly that causes me to have seizures.
14:24  raven737: Hi... i have some events in dmesg (link down on all interfaces) for which i want to know the exact time. I though i could simply take the "rtc_cmos setting system clock" timestamp and add the event time and then convert it to a readable format. but if i try that i get a date/time that is 3 days (28th) ahead... wtf?
14:24  lautriv: m1h0, because they need rock-solid clusters
14:24  robinetd: shirtless: Go troll someone else.
14:24  m1h0: true
14:24  shirtless: I'm not trolling.
14:25  m1h0: lautriv
14:25  shirtless: stop taking my alleged 'bait'
14:25  robinetd: shirtless: deal, start enjoying your implied ignore.
14:25  shirtless: oh no :(
14:25  shirtless: lautriv, imagebin.ca is a blank page
14:26  lautriv: raven737, is there a chance your machine is up since a longer time ?
14:26  m1h0: omg
14:26  m1h0: :S
14:26  shirtless: Is there a more casual linux channel ,like ##linux-chat or something
14:27  Psi-Jack: shirtless: /msg alis help
14:27  raven737: lautriv: well i mean the rtc_cmos line was part of the dmesg bootlog (@2.1 seconds)... so how could that be?
14:27  gordboy: raven737: you are ignoring the fraction of a second when the cmos is set, and then converting the elapsed seconds and adding to the start time ?
14:27  shirtless: Psi-Jack, thanks
14:27  grawity: raven737: how is that time useful anyway?
14:28  gordboy: grawity: [    0.455873] rtc_cmos 00:04: setting system clock to 2010-11-23 17:31:17 UTC (1290533477)
14:28  grawity: raven737: hint: you can read the current RTC value with `hwclock -r`
14:29  gordboy: grawity: he wants the date and time when certain events in dmesg happened
14:29  grawity: ah, right.
14:29  grawity: My 'dmesg' on Arch does not log time offsets for some reason
14:30  grawity: However, there's a human-readable timestamp in /var/log/messages
14:30  m1h0: i have a mb , the cmos is not working properly i wonder why it is
14:30  crocket: hmm
14:30  m1h0: the bios resets to defaults after a change applied
14:30  crocket: I value my data, but using 6GB to secure 2GB sounds expensive.
14:30  raven737: grawity: thanks for the help, the var log messages was what i was looking for! :)
14:31  crocket: 2 2TB disks for RAID1, and 1 2TB disk for backup.
14:31  grawity: m1h0: try changing CMOS battery.
14:31  m1h0: with a blank black screen
14:31  m1h0: i've tryed
14:31  m1h0: not working
14:31  m1h0: i think the cmos chip is gone
14:32  m1h0: but how to check for sure ?
14:32  Fieldy: probably a better question for ##hardware
14:33  m1h0: oh thanks
14:33  m1h0: ~
14:33  m1h0: !
14:33  crocket: I think (2 2TB for RAID1) + (1 2TB for backup) is not very different from (1 2TB) + (1 2TB for backup). How do you guys think?
14:33 --- archeleus is now known as archeleus|away
14:33  nothingworks: i think i rather not backup that way
14:33  crocket: In the point of view of storage security, a backup seems enough.
14:35  robinetd: crocket: Then you have to worry about sudden drive failure and not having an up-to-date backup.
14:35  gordboy: crocket: in the point of view of high availability, especially for a server, raid1 or raid10 is a very good idea
14:35  crocket: raid10?
14:35  EdwardIII: hrm i'm trying to setup a machine to join 2 subnets. i've added a POSTROUTING snat rule to iptables, installed bind, checked it was accessible externally, but the client i plugin on a different subnet can't seem to access the net?
14:35  Fieldy: ideally you have one backup and another backup which is kept offline (not connected to any power source or cables) when not being backed up to. this second one you also keep somewhere else, geographic separation.
14:35  Fieldy: if a fire or tornado or something takes out everything, hopefully you still have the second one.
14:35  crocket: robinetd, Can you detect any drive failure in case of RAID1?
14:35  EdwardIII: this is the rule i used: iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <external interface> -j SNAT --to <external interface's IP address>
14:35  crocket: If the secondary drive is functional even with the primary gone wrong, I wouldn't notice a problem in RAID1 configuration.
14:36  RenatoSilva: is there a way to ./configure and $make in Linux but targeted at Windows? That is, generate a dll from within Linux?
14:36  robinetd: crocket: ... If one drive fails, you have in mirrored on another drive up to the second it failed.
14:36  crocket: Fieldy : In the case of tornado, I wouldn't survive.
14:36 --- archeleus|away is now known as archeleus
14:36  gordboy: RenatoSilva: not without a set of compatible headers
14:36  crocket: I keep the drives in my residential house.
14:37  crocket: robinetd, I have in mirrored?
14:37  crocket: Is it a typo?
14:37  lautriv: m1h0, you may explain in more detail.
14:38  crocket: robinetd, Do we have a way to notice a failure of a drive in RAID1 configuration?
14:38  crocket: I mean automatically.
14:38  robinetd: crocket: Yeah, they start clicking and die.
14:38  crocket: hmm
14:38 --- JmZ is now known as JmZ_
14:38  crocket: robinetd : Do they die without making clicking sound?
14:39  robinetd: Yes, but then they let out wonderful magic smoke.
14:39  crocket: ha
14:39  crocket: smoke
14:39  crocket: robinetd, Is there any software way?
14:39  robinetd: crocket: SMART logs
14:39  crocket: hmm
14:39  crocket: SMART
14:39  crocket: ok
14:40  iulhk: hi all
14:40  crocket: robinetd, I wouldn't wait until the computer burns.
14:40  iulhk: how to check xvfb installed version in debian ? as well ho to check xvfb logs or prompt ?
14:41  crocket: robinetd, I would put SMART log in my home folder periodically with crontab.
14:41  robinetd: crocket: ... okay..
14:41  crocket: robinetd, Do you actually use 3 drives to secure 1 drive?
14:42  robinetd: Why would I?
14:42  crocket: robinetd, Because you recommended me to do so.
14:42  robinetd: No, I didn't.
14:42  RenatoSilva: gordboy: ok
14:42  crocket: robinetd, ok you didn't exactly recommend it
14:42  crocket: robinetd, why do you secure your data?
14:43  crocket: ops
14:43  crocket: oops
14:43  crocket: s/why/how/
14:43  robinetd: Securing it in what way? Encryption?
14:43  crocket: no
14:44  crocket: hardware failure or bad sectors
14:44  gordboy: robinetd: i think he means redundancy
14:44  gordboy: more than one copy
14:44  crocket: how do you secure you data from hardware failure or bad sectors?
14:44  EdwardIII: ah it was a problem with my bind perms - now i'm cooking!
14:44  robinetd: A large portion of my data is stuff I can easily get back just by redownloading it. The small amount of personal data I keep is backed up to an off-site host.
14:45  crocket: robinetd, do you pay for hosting?
14:45  gordboy: EdwardIII: is it snowing down there yet. beautiful sunny day here in edinburgh
14:45  crocket: or do you own it?
14:45  robinetd: crocket: pay for it.
14:45  crocket: ok
14:45  EdwardIII: however... will broadcast traffic pass between networks with this rule? iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j SNAT --to 172.16.1.61
14:45  EdwardIII: gordboy, bit of hail settled this morning but nothing serious. my phone told me it was snowing in edinburgh!
14:46  crocket: robinetd, I appreciate your advices.
14:46  robinetd: crocket: Most people do.
14:46  EdwardIII: robinetd, i appreciate your nickname
14:47  robinetd: EdwardIII: Most people read it wrong.
14:47  EdwardIII: ah, 'robin-etd'?
14:48  robinetd: robinet-d.
14:48  robinetd: Last name, first initial.
14:48  robinetd: People often ask me why I would want to rob inetd, or if I'm a faucet daemon.
14:48  robinetd: Makes me sad. :(
14:49  EdwardIII: i thought it was deliberate! i read it as robinet-d
14:50 * robinetd hugs EdwardIII.
14:50  crocket: I hope the reliability of hard drives rises up to the point where I don't need RAID at least.
14:50  lautriv: crocket, the opposite is the case, earlier drives were more solid.
14:50  EdwardIII: crocket, surely that will never be the case?
14:50  crocket: hmm
14:51  crocket: lautriv, that's sad
14:51  crocket: how about SSD?
14:51  nothingworks: ssd is overpriced and sucks
14:51  nothingworks: stay with mechanical
14:51  crocket: ok
14:51  EdwardIII: how about SSD for scratch/swap and mech for storage?
14:51  crocket: SSD is fast and seems good for storing operating system.
14:51  nothingworks: hard to do on a netbook but ill look into it
14:51  EdwardIII: actually i guess ram is so cheap now you should use ram for scratch/swap
14:52  lautriv: crocket, reason is the price you won't pay. i remember times where 80G was at $1200 but those are alive today.
14:52  crocket: lautriv : 32GB SSD is about 100~120usd. It's affordable for some people.
14:52  crocket: 32GB seems enough for an operating system if you don't build packages on slackware or FreeBSD.
14:53  lautriv: crocket, you know flash has a limited write-count ?
14:53  crocket: yes
14:53  crocket: 100 thounsand times
14:53  crocket: It's enough to sustain for 3~5 years?
14:53  lautriv: 32G can't even hold my audio-library :P
14:54  crocket: lautriv : 32G isn't for storage but is for an OS.
14:54  crocket: Plus
14:54  crocket: It's silent
14:54  crocket: When an SSD is put into a miniITX case with ATOM mainboard. The computer would be completely silent.
14:54  mrcarrot: hard disks are that silent nowdays that i can not hear them
14:55  lautriv: crocket, but you got 2x2G instead ?
14:55  crocket: mrcarrot, normal ones do I agree.
14:55  crocket: lautriv, I want to use it as NAS.
14:55  crocket: lautriv, hard drives if made right don't make annoying noises.
14:55  mrcarrot: i have built a atom miniITX with passive cooling and i added one 2.5" hd there... i had to put my ear against the case to hear it
14:56  crocket: But badly made hard drives would be loud
14:56  crocket: A refund or a replacement is neccesary in this case
14:56  crocket: I've seen a lot of people complaning about hard drive noise on the internet.
14:57  crocket: I'm afraid I join them any time.
14:58  crocket: lautriv, If a flash memory has a limited write-count, it means I have to change RAMs every 3~5 years?
14:58  Humanoid: When using CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL, is there a way I can see the list of included firmware in the running kernel?  Like maybe through /proc or /sys?
14:58  lautriv: crocket, FLASJ != RAM
14:59  lautriv: s/J/H
14:59  siriusnova: Can anyone reccomend me a good modern console (text based) mail client that isnt pine
14:59  blsecres: siriusnova: mutt
14:59  siriusnova: ive been using pine for the past 10 years, I think i need to switch
14:59  lautriv: Humanoid, dmesg reither
14:59  Carko23: Does anyone have an idea why would I get "ERROR: phase2 negotiation failed due to phase1 expired" with racoon - phase1 negotiation is successful and ISAKMP-SA gets established?
14:59  crocket: Do usb flash drives use the same material as SSD?
14:59  blsecres: siriusnova: I've been using mutt for the past 10 years, haven't found anything else that compares
14:59  karthee: yes .. they are magnetic devies ..
15:00  lautriv: crocket, close to
15:00 --- triplerhu_ is now known as triplerhu
15:00 --- triplerhu is now known as TripleRhu
15:00  Humanoid: lautriv: I don't see any list in dmesg
15:00  lautriv: Humanoid, no list, just a sucessful load
15:00  m1h0: hah
15:01  m1h0: okey !
15:01  Humanoid: I already have an unsuccessful load in my dmesg, that's why I'm looking for the list.
15:01  sedulous: crocket: some new usb 3.0 flash drives have outdated SSD controllers inside of them, + a SATA <-> USB bridge
15:01  lautriv: karthee, magnetic ?
15:01  blsecres: RAM is essentially a bunch of capacitors that must be constantly charged, flash is just a giant EEPROM
15:01  m1h0: sedulous, really ?
15:01  sedulous: crocket: so they're basically SSDs with a USB interface
15:01  sedulous: m1h0: yes
15:01  crocket: EEPROM!!!
15:01  m1h0: sedulous: i have not used usb 3.0 yet
15:01  Humanoid: the firmware is supposed to already be included in the kernel, so I'm looking to see a list to make sure it's there.
15:02  sedulous: m1h0: i'm too lazy to look it up atm but some new USB sticks are basically small SSDs
15:02  sedulous: old jmicron controllers and stuff
15:02  crocket: Isn't EEPROM used in cartridges for old game consoles?
15:02  lautriv: Humanoid, you know recent kernels dropped a bunch of firmware due to licensing problems? what kerne/distro ?
15:03  lautriv: crocket, no and it'S far OT
15:03  m1h0: sedulous: i am not familiar with ssd0
15:04  m1h0: it feels like a rock
15:04  m1h0: anyway
15:04  Humanoid: vanilla 2.6.35.7, I compiled it myself, the firmware gets put into /lib/firmware when I do make modules_install, so I suspect it should be included within the kernel itself too.
15:05  crocket: Are 2.6.35.7 firmware compatible with linux 2.6.35.4?
15:05  crocket: or 2.6.34.x?
15:05  Humanoid: But yet whenever I modprobe radeon.ko, it fails to load it, even though it should be included within the kernel with CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
15:05  lautriv: Humanoid, if that were the case, you won't need /lib/firmware
15:06  Humanoid: lautriv: Yeah, I shouldn't need /lib/firmware, since it's supposed to be included in the kernel, but it still fails to load it.
15:06  m1h0: lol
15:06  lautriv: Humanoid, because the firmware for a radeon is non-free.
15:06  sedulous: m1h0: okay, I looked it up. for example the "A-Data Nobility N005" USB 3.0 stick (16 GB capacity) uses an old SATA NAND-Flash controller that could be found in the first cheap SSDs, plus a SATA<->USB 3.0 bridge. apparently that's cheaper than buying/designing a pure USB 3.0 NAND flash controller
15:06  Humanoid: So I was wondering if /sys or /proc have a directory or file that lists the included firmware blobs, so I can double check that it's indeed included.
15:07  m1h0: i am still thinking how to escape the ANSI C language limitations and compatibility in linux
15:07  m1h0: you think about device drivers
15:07  m1h0: heh
15:07  sedulous: ("JMicron JMF601" controller)
15:07  m1h0: check up the driver
15:07  m1h0: you should be able to modify it
15:07  Humanoid: lautriv: So it fails to find the firmware because it's non-free???
15:07  m1h0: heh !
15:07  m1h0: theoretically speaking
15:08  lautriv: Humanoid, there is another package for non-free firmware
15:08  m1h0: linux non-free stuff sux
15:08  m1h0: for real
15:08  sedulous: depending on where you draw the line, it's very hard to run a purely free system
15:09  Humanoid: Lautriv: the firmware in question is not in another package, it's included in the 2.6.35.7 packages I got from kernel.org
15:09  m1h0: i guess that is true
15:09  sedulous: (x86 microcode, BIOS, and stuff)
15:09  m1h0: depends on what you use it
15:09  m1h0: you running apple or something you need a paid support or something
15:10  lautriv: Humanoid, if that is the case, you should be fine.
15:10  sedulous: m1h0: no, i meant non-free software like your average BIOS or the microcode on x86 CPUs
15:10  Humanoid: It's in the firmware directory in the root of the kernel source, it gets installed with "make modules_install".
15:10  Humanoid: But I am not fine, which is why I am here.
15:10  m1h0: oh i have a bios chip running wild
15:10  sedulous: there are free BIOS replacements but not many and possibly not for the very latest mainboards / architectures
15:11  m1h0: i guess it is more like hardware issue
15:11  sedulous: BIOS is software. it runs on the CPU.
15:11  m1h0: you see the bios chip is bit old
15:11  m1h0: oh , so my cpu is giving those errors
15:11  sedulous: i don't know what you are talking about, m1h0
15:12  m1h0: i have mb  , old one. - it does not allow any changes in the bios after a 2 years of overclock of 10% +
15:13  m1h0: so the thing that i seek to fix is the cpu ?
15:13  m1h0: no i don't think so
15:13  lautriv: Humanoid, you may paste your dmesg
15:14  m1h0: well you asked me anyway

15:17  sedulous: m1h0: when I was talking about the CPU, i was referring to "<m1h0> linux non-free stuff sux" -- the BIOS is usually non-free, as is the CPU's microcode
15:17  Humanoid: It's also in the <kernelsource>/firmware/radeon directory.
15:17  Humanoid: It was in the kernel source's firmware directory when I compiled the kernel with CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
15:18  lautriv: m1h0, some beeps ?
15:18  Humanoid: My understanding is that it's supposed to be inside the compiled kernel, so I don't need it in my filesystem.
15:20  unfancy: when i bootup linux.. i have to unplug and reattach my usb-hd before it shows up at the fancy guy or in /dev :(
15:21  unfancy: that makes me sad
15:21  Humanoid: When I compile the kernel I see "  IHEX    firmware/radeon/RS780_pfp.bin" so I know it's aware of the firmware and building it.
15:21  lautriv: Humanoid, but you have to meet all dependencies, most of them pushing via I2C or SMB, maybe D1W.........is all compiled in ?
15:23  Humanoid: modprobe takes care of loading all dependencies.
15:23  Humanoid: For example i2c_core.ko which is needed by radeon.ko is automatically loaded.
15:24  Humanoid: The dmesg log clearly shows that uploading the firmware to the hardware is NOT the problem.  It's finding the firmware file itself which is the problem, which shouldn't be since it's supposed to be included in the kernel thanks to CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
15:24  lautriv: Humanoid, when there is a radeon.ko, why will you have the firmware build-in anyway ?
15:24  BCMM_: if you want to use KMS, radeon drivers must be built in, not modular
15:25  Humanoid: lautriv: Because I can
15:25  Humanoid: BCMM_: KMS is off at the moment, modeset=0 (which is the default)
15:26  Humanoid: BCMM_: No wait, sorry.
15:26  Humanoid: BCMM_: I used modeset=1.
15:26  Humanoid: BCMM_: When I didn't use modeset=1, it didn't try loading the firmware so it was fine.
15:27  Humanoid: It's when I do "modprobe radeon modeset=1" that's when it tries to load the firmware and fails.
15:27  Humanoid: BCMM_: Are you saying that because I compiled it as a module, that's it's not able to find the firmware?
15:28  Humanoid: So if I build radeon.ko into the kernel and not as a module, it will find the firmware?
15:29  BCMM_: Humanoid: no, i'm asking if you're trying to use kms
15:29  Humanoid: BCMM_: I used modeset=1, so yes.
15:31  Humanoid: BCMM_: [   45.578891] [drm] radeon kernel modesetting enabled. <-- because I loaded radeon.ko with modeset=1.
15:32  Tapke: ok. here's the situacion. I have postfix that is configured with virtual boxes and auth is done via ldap on AD. The mailboxes are on abc.com domain, and virtuals are on abc.xyz.com. How should I make aliases? I want to redirect temporary from user1@abc.com to user2@abc.com. No mater where I put aliases, user2 doesn't get messages of user1. If I remove user1 email adress from AD and leave only alias, the message bounces with "user not found".
15:33  Tapke: Help!
15:33  Psi-Jack: Tapke: Have you tried #postfix?
15:33  Tapke: ?
15:33  Tapke: oh
15:33  Tapke: ok. i will
15:34  Humanoid: I have just tried loading another module that needs firmware, which is supposed to be included in the kernel, and it too fails to load.
15:34  lautriv: Tapke, wrong channel for AD.
15:34  cong06: after I 'umount -l /media/disk' is there any way to check to make sure that it's unmounted? other than remounting and unmounting again?
15:34  Humanoid: So the problem is with CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL in general, not specific to radeon.
15:35  Tapke: lautriv, I suppose this is for postfix conf not AD :-)
15:35  lautriv: Tapke, rather LDAP which is part of your AD
15:36  [CRT]: cong06: df -h and/or mount should show you what is mounted
15:36  Tapke: i just need a redirection of all emails of user1 to user2
15:36  Tapke: that is for ALIASES
15:36  Tapke: that seem to ignore my conf :/
15:36  grawity: Make sure $alias_maps in your 'conf' is actually set to the right path
15:36  cong06: [CRT] after you 'umount -l' the device can still be written/read from, while unmounted. It doesn't show up in 'df'.
15:37  BCMM_: Humanoid: well, if you want kms to work, you need radeon built in, since it needs to load before root is mounted
15:37  Humanoid: BCMM_: Well, radeon is not the problem, since I get the same problem with another module.
15:37  Humanoid: BCMM_: The problem is with CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL
15:38  Tapke: grawity, alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
15:38  [CRT]: cong06: umount -l is not a valid option (at least not with my umount) .. if df doesn't show your mounted disk(s) then they are not mounted
15:38  cong06: from the man page: "  -l     Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore.  (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)"
15:39  cong06: and that's not captial i but lowercase L incase you have sans-serif like me.
15:39  Humanoid: request_firmware() is supposed to find the firmware without having to call out to userspace.
15:40  dv_: hi
15:40  [CRT]: cong06: what distro? i just looked over my mount man page and evidently -l is for adding 'labels' ... nothing about a lazy umount
15:40  dv_: i have to be root to bind to a UDP port. what is the reason for this?
15:40  dv_: is binding to UDP a security concern?
15:41  lautriv: Humanoid, paste your .config
15:41  Humanoid: lautriv: where?
15:41  grawity: dv_: No, it isn't. I think you instead hit the "low ports" restriction: 1-1024, both TCP and UDP, are reserved to root.
15:41  dv_: oh.
15:42  dv_: even port 80?
15:42  lautriv: Humanoid, any pastebin
15:42  grawity: dv_: if 80 is between 1 and 1024, yes.
15:42  dv_: hm. port 80 is one of the most popular ones. so webservers have to run as root
15:42  dv_: better use jails then :)
15:42  grawity: dv_: no, they don't *run* as root.
15:42  dv_: but yes, i am using port 514
15:43  dv_: i'm listening to syslog udp packets
15:43  sedulous: they usually do most of the work in a lesser privileged child process, dv_
15:43  grawity: dv_: Apache and other httpds start as root, bind to ports, read SSL keys, then permanently drop to their own users.
15:43  grawity: dv_: setreuid()
15:43  dv_: ah ok
15:43  grawity: s/users/user accounts/
15:43  dv_: yes i remember now.
15:44  dv_: iirc, it is strongly recommended to make use of setreuid() in daemons etc. unless root is absolutely necessary
15:44  djoef: Hi, I am working on a remote machine (eg logged in as "user") via ssh. Someone else started a program on this machine (under my account) and I would like to see the output of that terminal screen, is this possible ?
15:44  dv_: that is, i think this is what was said in the unix courses i attended long ago.. anyway, thanks for the infos
15:45  Humanoid: lautriv: http://pastebin.ca/2001998
15:46  [CRT]: djoef: screen session? if so, you can do screen -x to follow whats on that screen
15:46  grawity: djoef: Depends. Is it running on a tty or pty? Inside a tmux/screen or not? Previous output or only future one?
15:46  ananke: djoef: if they didn't use such tool like 'screen', then it's not going to be easy
15:46 * [CRT] should really give tmux a try after hearing good things about it
15:47  lautriv: Humanoid, still waiting for load, seems a bit lazy......
15:47  djoef: ok, they just started this terminal using the graphical UI.. so it will not be a screen session.. only future output would be great.
15:48  djoef: In other words, If I ask them to start a terminal, then use screen, and from there start this command (which needs the UI to run unfortunately) I would be able to grab this window through screen -r from here (with the remote connection through ssh)
15:48  lautriv: Humanoid, line # 810 ?
15:48  grawity: djoef: It's best to use screen or tmux, yes
15:48  djoef: with window I mean terminal window
15:49  lautriv: Humanoid, and line # 813 of course
15:49  windowshasyou: whoa http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148413
15:50  Humanoid: Laurenceb_: 810 m, yes, it's already loaded as firmware_class.ko
15:50  Humanoid: lautriv:
15:51  Humanoid: lautriv: #813 = "firmware", that's the default that comes with the kernel, I didn't change it, so it's supposed to refer to the firmware subdir within the root of the kernel source tree.
15:51  siriusnova: Herm
15:52  siriusnova: anyone here use mutt with two different gmail accounts
15:52  siriusnova: any idea how to set that up?
15:53  lautriv: Humanoid, mine is blank and it points  to "extra" firmware, only needed if not shipped.
15:53  Humanoid: lautriv: what's blank?
15:54  lautriv: Humanoid, =""
15:54  Humanoid: lautriv: ???=""
15:54  lautriv: Humanoid, CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE=""           because it's not "extra"
15:55  Humanoid: I added a firmware in CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE, because it was not included with the kernel source.
15:55  Humanoid: That's irrelevent.
15:56  lautriv: <Humanoid> lautriv: #813 = "firmware", that's the default that comes with the kernel, I didn't change it    WHAT NOW ? and is that loader-module up before ?
15:57  Humanoid: It finds the firmware in the "firmware" directory, so that is not a problem.
15:57  cong06: anyone else know anything about lazy unmount? http://aplawrence.com/Linux/lazy-unmount.html
15:58  windowshasyou: cong06: only that it is occasionally useful.
15:59  Humanoid: Sorry, #813 "firmware" wasn't the default, I set it to that.  But it's still irrelevent.
15:59  Humanoid: It only affects where to look for firmware during compilation, not while the kernel is running.
15:59  Humanoid: And it finds all the firmware during compilation just find as proven by the "make" output.
16:00  Humanoid: s/find/fine/
16:03  marduk: that would change "finds" to "fines"
16:04  Humanoid: I think I found the problem.  In the makefiles, I see there are two lists: $(fw-shipped-y) and $(fw-shipped-m), does anybody know how I can output the values of each of these?
16:04  cong06: ok. it seems that if you wanna check if lazy unmount succeeded, you can run "iostat /dev/sda" for example...
16:04  grawity: marduk: < > are often implied in IRCre
16:05  Humanoid: According to firmware/Makefile only $fw-shipped-y) get included into the kernel, not anything from $(fw-shipped-m)
16:05  marduk: still same effect
16:07  EdwardIII: hrm in wireshark i can see packets from my machine going to the broadcast address but not vice versa. is this normal?
16:07  EdwardIII: i'm plugged into a switch
16:08  grawity: EdwardIII: packets generally are *not* sent with broadcast address as the source.
16:08  grawity: EdwardIII: so replies have the replying machine's address.
16:08  mAniAk-_-: are the other machines sending broadcasts?
16:09  EdwardIII: grawity, hrm, how can i modify stuff like NETBIOS flying around the network?
16:09  EdwardIII: not modify, monitor!
16:09  EdwardIII: i should point out i'm on a vmware guest, i don't know if that will affect things
16:10  grawity: EdwardIII: if it's being broadcast by other machines... it *should* reach you (dunno about VMware)
16:10  grawity: But not all NetBIOS packets are broadcast
16:10  grawity: Only the name service, afaik.
16:10  EdwardIII: hrm
16:10  EdwardIII: basically i'm trying to create something like a vlan here
16:10  EdwardIII: and i just wanted to check the segregated subnet isn't exchanging broadcast data with the main subnet
16:11  EdwardIII: which i don't think it should be
16:14  Humanoid: lautriv: Thanks for you help, but I found the source of the problem.
16:30  karthick87: how to automount flash drive?
16:31  mAniAk-_-: install ubuntu
16:31  lautriv: karthick87, plugin and wait a few seconds
16:31  m1h0: ubuntu
16:31  m1h0: ask your local operator
16:31  karthick87: lautin: done
16:31  karthick87: lautriv: done
16:31  lautriv: mAniAk-_-, m1h0 ubu-crap never invented auto-mount so what ?
16:32  m1h0: auto mount is present
16:32  m1h0: you think it is crap , but it is not a crap for sure
16:32  lautriv: karthick87, then do a fdisk -l
16:32  m1h0: maybe a little
16:32  m1h0: .
16:33  karthick87: lautriv: done
16:33  lautriv: karthick87, result ?
16:33  mAniAk-_-: lautriv: so? 'it just works' there
16:33  lautriv: m1h0, |<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->| so little :P
16:34  lautriv: mAniAk-_-, and ho is this related to "how do i automount" ?
16:34  karthick87: lautriv: http://paste.ubuntu.com/536342/
16:36  lautriv: karthick87, the last line shows you this sdb1 (4g), df tells you the mountpoint probably under /mnt or /media
16:36  mAniAk-_-: lautriv: and how is who invented what related to this
16:36  indietrash: ddrescue output "rescued", is this 100% safe/good data?
16:37  lautriv: mAniAk-_-, BECAUSE THE INITIAL QUESTION WAS : <karthick87> how to automount flash drive?
16:37  mAniAk-_-: lautriv: but why does it matter who invented automount?
16:38  lautriv: mAniAk-_-, you don't get it, don't you ? if one asking this way, "install ubu" is simply a dumb answer.
16:39  EdwardIII: in case anyone's interested it does look like being inside the VM is stopping me from seeing the broadcast data in wireshark, weirdly
16:39  EdwardIII: probably due to natting or ip bridging or however it's utilising the host adapter
16:40  karthick87: lautriv: see this http://paste.ubuntu.com/536343/
16:40  m1h0: like a black hole
16:41  m1h0: it is expanding
16:41  invaderzim: need help with iwconfig, cant connect to wep wifi or even no auth wifi router...
16:42  Skunky: invaderzim: why not?
16:42  alex88: hi guys, i've a marvell sata-6 controller that's not recognized by ubuntu and fedora.. how can i check if the newer kernel has the driver for it?
16:42  karthick87: invaderzim: type iwscan
16:42  invaderzim: iwlist scan works
16:42  lautriv: karthick87, do you have ntfs-3g installed ?
16:42  mAniAk-_-: lautriv: what i get is that the inventor is unrelated to any of this
16:42  m1h0: fedora regognizes
16:42  invaderzim: but iwconfig eth0 essid "name" does nothing
16:42  invaderzim: I mean, when I type iwconfig to check, ESSID reads ""
16:42  alex88: m1h0, was that to me?
16:42  invaderzim: it doesnt associate to the network
16:43  alex88: m1h0, or it was just an english correction? :)
16:43  m1h0: i guess so
16:43  m1h0: speak up dude
16:43  m1h0: what is you problemo
16:43  m1h0: heh
16:43  lautriv: mAniAk-_-, ubuntu is unrelated, nothing else.
16:43  karthick87: lautriv: see i have installed
16:44  m1h0: bah
16:44  karthick87: lautriv: yes i have installed
16:44  m1h0: not a space science again
16:44  m1h0: !
16:44  alex88: m1h0, well.. i've tried to boot and installer can't see hdd.. also if i set hdd in raid,ide,ahci mode in bios
16:44  invaderzim: Skunky: ?
16:44  m1h0: i have trruble writting
16:45  m1h0: can touy repeat that
16:45  m1h0: wyh
16:45  m1h0: .
16:45  mAniAk-_-: lautriv: well no
16:46  bluj: alex88, you can build your own kernel..
16:46  Skunky: invaderzim: eth0 is your wireless, not wired?  try using the AP instead of the essid....
16:46  alex88: bluj, to test if it works? no way to see if it's implemented by id of the hardware?
16:47  karthick87: lautriv: ??
16:47  invaderzim: Skunky: sorry its eth1... you mean the mac address of the ap?
16:47  m1h0: surpass Linus Torwalds and build your own kernel
16:47  bluj: bluj, well in building your kernel you get to choose the support its built with... i'm just assuming that the kernel has support.
16:47  bluj: alex88, oops.. ^^
16:47  m1h0: i mean it is written in C
16:47  lautriv: karthick87, sorry was afk........what's the state ?
16:48  Skunky: invaderzim: instead of essid blah, use ap a:b:c:d:e or whatever the mac of the AP is
16:48  karthick87: lautriv: brb
16:48  alex88: bluj, but i need to make a custom iso of a distribution cause i can't get a os to install
16:48  bluj: alex88, you dont have to fully build it.. you can acquire the source and 'make menuconfig' and just search to see that support is in fact available.. then, you can either look for a different repo kernel that might have support.. or you can build it yourself
16:48  alex88: bluj, ok got it ..thank you
16:49  bluj: alex88, yes.. well, youre probably in for some work no matter which avenue you go ;)
16:49  m1h0: ffs i don't know C
16:49  alex88: i know :)
16:49  invaderzim: Skunky: i think i tried that already... anyway i'll try again, any other ideas?
16:49  m1h0: really
16:49  m1h0: tell me hello
16:49  m1h0: in C
16:49  m1h0: !]
16:50  m1h0: i might be a little offf
16:50  Skunky: invaderzim: if it's got a wep key, set it on the same line as trying to set essid or ap.  or try setting all 3, essid ap and key on the same command line... and make sure you're not trying to connect to an ap that's not strong enough to actually talk to...
16:50  m1h0: like a main F
16:51  invaderzim: Skunky: ok will try thank you

17:05  Psi-Jack: Hmmm, heck, with opensuse, you can setup a dual-redundant master/slave replication authentication server with TLS enabled, plus auto-registration with iSLP for near fully automated setup for all clients, in about 15 minutes.
17:05  Psi-Jack: Err, replication authentication LDAP server. ;)
17:10  EdwardIII: pff no biggie
17:10  EdwardIII: my distro shoots lasers from its eyes
17:13  supe: EdwardIII: My distro shoots lasers from its sharks
17:13  EdwardIII: my distro is chuck norris
17:14  supe: My distro had chuck norris for breakfast
17:14  EdwardIII: my distro has smooth fullscreen flash playing
