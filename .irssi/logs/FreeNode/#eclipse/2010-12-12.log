03:35  iaj: hi there!
03:35  iaj: someone up?  Ive got a project that's using another project in order to get its job done -- I saw a mate of mine who was able to disable all the warnings/errors that the first project may consist of -- can someone tell me how I can do that?
05:11  markovchain: I have the netbook version of ubuntu 10.04. if I type  sudo apt-get install eclipse which version of eclipse will i get?
06:03  SwordCoder: I have a complaint/suggestion for improving eclipse.
06:07  SwordCoder: trying to figure out which download to use is confusing.  The existing docs (such as http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/compare-packages) are unhelpful.  They require you to know too much about what non-obviously named packages contribute to an eclipse installation.
08:16 --- ronr_away is now known as ronr_
08:50  ZeuPiark: hello
08:53  ronr_: are you certain?
08:58  ronr_: thought so.
09:15  pen: hey
09:15  pen: I am using Google's window builder pro to build ui
09:15  pen: and I create a SWT template project and added something to the window
09:15  pen: the preview works perfectly
09:16  pen: but when I tried to run it gave me errors
09:16  pen: and I deduce it must be some missing library didn't get added to the classpath
09:16  pen: and it looks like eclipse swt is not added
09:16  pen: althought it should've been added when I created the project
09:16  pen: anyone know how to add this library?
09:41  ronr_: pen: I wouldn't be surprised it take a while to get an answer to your question... not the best time to ask :)
09:41  pen: anyway, I solved it. the persist container is misleading
09:42  ronr_: glad to have helped ;)
09:42  pen: I just added back to reference library and it worked
09:42  pen: I have no idea why the template does that
09:42  pen: so stupid
09:42  pen: also
09:42  pen: I wonder
09:42  pen: so
09:42  pen: I am using google's window builder pro
09:42  pen: and I import the swt library
09:42  pen: it also comes with the source
09:43  pen: how do I make eclipse to use the source to generate javadoc? so I have autocompletion?
09:45  ronr_: what does javadoc have to do with autocompletion?
09:48  pen: ronr_: well, sorry I mean autocomplete and also javadoc
09:48  pen: right now I don't have either
09:50  ronr_: pen: okay. you can attach the sources to the jar in order to see the sources (and whatever javadoc is attached to them)
09:50  ronr_: pen: as for the auto-complete, what kind of auto-complete is missing?
09:50  pen: ronr_: what do you mean by that? I have two jars one is binary one is source
09:51  pen: ronr_: I don't know why even System.out.println doesn't have autocomplete now
09:51  pen: :(
09:52  ronr_: pen: let's solve it one by one. not sure I can, since I'm not an expert, but perhaps something will work.
09:52  ronr_: pen: when you go to the java build path of the project, what do you have in the libraries tab?
09:58  pen: hey
09:58  pen: oh
09:58  pen: lots
09:58  ronr_: is the jre there?
09:58  pen: yes
09:58  pen: of course
10:01  ronr_: hmm, I'm not sure why the content assist doesn't work for you.
10:03  pen: like
10:03  ronr_: it doesn't work for anything?
10:03  pen: I type System
10:03  pen: it doesn't show anything
10:03  pen: it used to though
10:03  pen: or System.
10:03  pen: now it just show nothing
10:03  ronr_: err, you don't click ctrl+space?
10:03  pen: I did click that
10:03  pen: of course
10:04  ronr_: if you type "System." and ctrl+space, you get nothing?
10:05  pen: yea
10:06  ronr_: though for System.out.println you'd want to use the sysout ctrl+space shortcut.
10:06  ronr_: but I have no idea why it doesn't work.
10:07  ronr_: unless it doesn't recognize it as a java class.
10:07  ronr_: that could be it.
10:08  pen: hmm
10:08  pen: but it compiles and runs
10:08  pen: doesn't make sense at all
10:09  ronr_: that's true
10:09  ronr_: I suppose you already tried restarting eclipse :)
10:10  ronr_: do you have several projects? does it work in some and not in others?
10:11  pen: hmm
10:11  pen: yea
10:11  pen: let me try wiht other projecs
10:12  pen: hmm
10:12  pen: doesn't seems to work anymore
10:12  pen: :(
10:13  ronr_: ok, go into window->preferences
10:13  pen: ok
10:13  ronr_: general->keys
10:14  ronr_: in the filter, type "content"
10:14  ronr_: for the content assist, is the binding still ctrl+space?
10:15  pen: hmm, does it say ctrl+space directly? i'm on a mac actaully so it might appear differently
10:15  pen: yea
10:15  pen: it is ctrl+space
10:15  pen: for content assist
10:16  ronr_: that could be the problem though
10:16  ronr_: that you're on mac
10:16  pen: but I just tried that
10:16  pen: it is actually ctrl+space
10:16  ronr_: mac is evil
10:16  ronr_: :p
10:16  pen: lol
10:16  ronr_: I thought macs don't have a ctrl key
10:16  pen: mac has one
10:17  ronr_: isn't it a command key or something of that sort?
10:17  pen: it worked before but doesn't now so weird althought it still show the dialog screen
10:17  pen: or the overlay
10:17  pen: whatever
10:17  pen: but it says no default proposal
10:17  ronr_: wait, what?
10:17  pen: something liek that
10:17  ronr_: and if you ctrl+space again?
10:17  pen: yea, no default proposal
10:17  ronr_: and again?
10:18  pen: I mean when I type something then hit that
10:18  pen: like System.
10:18  pen: it just say no default proposals
10:18  pen: but it used to be automatically
10:18  ronr_: what used to be automatically?
10:19  ZeuPiark: bye
10:19  pen: what the hell
10:20  pen: now I checked java type and java proposals thingy and now it seems to work again.
10:20  pen: wonder why they are unchecked in the first place
10:20  ronr_: you checked it where?
10:21  ronr_: okay, let's do the source attachment now.
10:21  ronr_: in the package explorer, go to the jar you want to attach sources to
10:21  pen: in side preference
10:21  pen: inside
10:21  pen: ok
10:21  ronr_: go to its properties
10:22  ronr_: the first option will be java source attachment. just point to the jar with the sources, and viola.
10:22  pen: ok
10:22  pen: wait
10:22  pen: hold on
10:23  pen: I already have a source.jar for the jar I want
10:23  ronr_: then?
10:23  pen: do I still need to do that attachment?
10:23  pen: or there is other way?
10:23  pen: so
10:23  pen: I have the org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx
10:23  pen: and also the source jar
10:23  pen: both jars are in the classpath
10:23  ronr_: you don't need the source jar in the classpath
10:24  ronr_: it's meaningless
10:24  pen: ok
10:24  pen: so I should go into the swt property and then select that source.jar?
10:25  ronr_: go to the jar you want to attach the sources to, and attach its source jar to it.
10:25  pen: hm
10:25  pen: oh nice
10:26  pen: seems like autocomplete works for swt too now
10:26  pen: thanks
10:26  ronr_: np
10:26  pen: coo
10:26  pen: cool
10:26  pen: also
10:26  pen: I wonder if you develop python in eclipse?
10:26  pen: do you use pydev?
10:26  ronr_: nope
10:27  pen: ok just curious
10:27  pen: since the autocomplete in pydev is horrible
10:27  pen: :P
10:27  ronr_: don't know anything about that

If you have errors or logs to show, see ~pastebin. If you have screenshots to share, see ~imagebin. If you need to describe your problem, please provide some ~info about your setup. Please be patient when waiting for a response. Thank you and enjoy your stay.
17:42  alxFradiani: is there a way on eclipse to collapse blocks between large if{} ?
17:47  rcjsuen: alxFradiani: If you mean Java, not by default no
17:48  alxFradiani: ok. well i'm trying to do it with the shortcut keys
17:48  alxFradiani: what about CDT
17:48  rcjsuen: I don't do C, no comment.
18:38  armence: Hello. I am trying to import standard java packages such as java.io.Files. But I am getting an error in Eclipse: The import java.io cannot be resolved. What might be the problem
18:46  rcjsuen: armence: Does it work in a new workspace?
18:47  armence: rcjsuen, You mean a new project? Yes. This is actually a project I imported.
18:48  rcjsuen: No, I meant a new workspace, but I guess that's not important if it works in a new project.
18:53  armence: rcjsuen, Any idea?
19:01  rcjsuen: You could try comparing the two projects' .classpath and .project files I suppose.
19:01  rcjsuen: or maybe clean your projects
19:01  rcjsuen: close/reopen them/eclipse
19:03  RenatoSilva: armence: maybe check your installed JREs in Window > Preferences
19:03  RenatoSilva: armence: for example, the project may use some specific JRE which is not listed there
19:04  RenatoSilva: armence: in this case, it should be listed in the problem list
19:20  Patabugen:  Does anyone know if it's possible to disable syntax highlighting? I've got Helios Service Release 1.
19:26  RenatoSilva: use notepad
19:27  DemoOn: hi, can some1 help me with eclipse php development toolkit installation? Because, when I press "I accept terms of license agreements " I can't press Next, that button keeps staying like I woul'd have pressed
19:28  rcjsuen: Patabugen: I guess if you changed your colours to all be black. Though I'm not sure why would want to do this.
19:28  Patabugen: I want to because the defaults are awful (for a dark theme) and I'm finding it very laborous to change
19:30  RenatoSilva: so you're trying to create a dark theme?
19:31  Patabugen: No, I'm trying to use one. I have little interest in having to make it
19:31  Patabugen: I'm coming from Netbeans where it's really easy to download/share themes
19:31  DemoOn: can some1 help me? Is there a way i am doing something complitely wrong?
19:31  Patabugen: Demon what Operating system are you using?
19:32  DemoOn: linux ubuntu
19:32  Patabugen: Have you a link to the file you downloaded?

21:09  heiko: i have a problem that i don't know how to google about: some of my ScrolledComposite scroll "very slowly". i can drag the scrollbar and everything is fine. but if i click the little arrows for scrolling up or down, the increments of scrolling are very small. i'd like to change those increments, i suppose. where do i look? would appreciate any pointers.
21:12  rcjsuen: you could try configuring the scroll bars themselves there might be something ther
21:12  heiko: right. hmm, i wonder why they behave in what feels like a "non-standard" way, it seems like they move pixel-by-pixel.
21:13  heiko: found the ScrollBar class, thanks
21:15  heiko: ow. the pageincrement behavior i was wondering about seems to be a longstanding bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=39934

21:54  tidbit: I've even tried the manual way of ctrl+shift+space, nothing pops up
22:06  nitind: Have you properly set up a PHP Project?
22:07  tidbit: well, i loaded my php file and setup the .exe and .ini file.
22:09  tidbit: it also shows all my custom functions in the Outliner.
22:31  Daikoku: hey there. i am new to eclipse. is it possible to work on a remote server directly via SFTP? I did not find a function for that
22:35  nitind: ~tell Daikoku about tm
22:35  Arbalest: Daikoku: Check out Eclipse's Target Management project - http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/
22:43  Daikoku: nitind: thank you very much! i downloaded the Rse-stuff. Can i just replace the folder in "features"?
22:44  Daikoku: because most of the folders like "org.eclipse.rse ..." already exist
22:49  rcjsuen: What do you mean "replace"
22:49  rcjsuen: I really wouldn't manually try to modify the features/ and plugins/ folder (or their contents) unless I knew what I was doing.
