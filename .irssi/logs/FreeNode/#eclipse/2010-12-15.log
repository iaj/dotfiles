01:01  myusuf3: hi guys
01:01  myusuf3: i have question about updatesites
01:10  myusuf3: how come only some of the create the archive file that you can point to and install
01:16  myusuf3: rcjsuen, hi
01:20  Mkop: I got an error trying to load the compare editor for a PHP file tracked in Mercurial. when reporting the bug, which product should I list it under?
01:22  rcjsuen: myusuf3: hi
01:22  rcjsuen: Mkop: what does your error look like
01:22  Mkop: oh, I found platform in the dropdown.
01:22  rcjsuen: do you have the trace from the logs?
01:22  Mkop: Message: Unable to create editor ID org.eclipse.compare.CompareEditor: An unexpected exception was thrown.
01:22  Mkop: yes
01:22  Mkop: unexpected exception = NPE
01:23  nitind: You might want to ~pastebin the full stack trace.
01:23  Arbalest: Please paste the relevant information onto a pastebin. The submission will generate a URL which you can then copy/paste back into the channel - http://www.pastebin.ca/ - http://pastebin.com/ - http://pastebin.org - http://ideone.com/
01:23  RenatoSilva: don't forget pastie.org
01:24  Mkop: should I do that rather than posting on bugzilla?
01:24  RenatoSilva: Mkop: window > view > error log, clean it, do it, see it
01:24  rcjsuen: Mkop: maybe someone here knows something about your problem already
01:24  Mkop: RenatoSilva: I did that already a few times.
01:24  rcjsuen: doesn't hurt to share
01:24  nitind: Why else bring it up?
01:25  Mkop: in a minute I'll post a bugzilla link
01:25  RenatoSilva: Mkop: why don't you paste the complete log then
01:25  MaxPrt: are there any good plugins for code folding / code collapse
01:25  RenatoSilva: Mkop: "compoent xyz raised a NPE" is not so helpful
01:27  nitind: MaxPrt: Unless that's the *only* thing you want an editor to do, you might want to check to see if the editor you already have supports that feature as well.
01:27  MaxPrt: nitind: im just using the standard eclipse editor?
01:28  RenatoSilva: MaxPrt: to edit what kind of file
01:28  MaxPrt: RenatoSilva: C++
01:28  MaxPrt: RenatoSilva: sorry, C
01:28  RenatoSilva: MaxPrt: is the code being highlighted? iirc CDT editor does that
01:28  nitind: MaxPrt: Eclipse is the framework.  It has lots of different editors inside of it.  Checl the C editor's preferences to see if that's just something you have to turn on.
01:29  nitind: For example, it used to be there, but off by default, in the XML Editor.
01:29  RenatoSilva: MaxPrt: if it's not being highlighted, then maybe you're opening the c file with default text editor, not the one contributed by CDT
01:30  nitind: Assuming CDT is installed.
01:30  RenatoSilva: indeed
01:30 * RenatoSilva doesn't know any other C/C++ plugin
01:30  MaxPrt: of you're right, it does
01:30  MaxPrt: now how would I use it (ie. collapse code)?
01:31  RenatoSilva: you who, about what, does what
01:31  nitind: Look for the indicators in the vertical ruler (the one on the left).
01:32  MaxPrt: ah i see, i had to restar eclipse to get the minuses and plusses to show up
01:32  MaxPrt: thanks
01:32  MaxPrt: on that note, is there any way to specify massive blocks to collapse?
01:33  Mkop: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=332594
01:34  Mkop: although, it may be a duplicate of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=326194 - I need to read the comments there closely
01:35  nitind: MaxPrt: You might have just needed to close and reopen that one editor.
01:36  nitind: You *really* don't want people to see your stack trace, do you?
01:36  MaxPrt: nitind: ??
01:36  Mkop: nitind: I posted the stack trace!
01:37  nitind: Just missed it.  Oh, PHP.  Again.
01:39  rcjsuen: Mkop: Yes, it's a dupe
01:40  Mkop: rcjsuen: should I go ahead and mark it as dupe and close it?
01:40  rcjsuen: Mkop: Yes, please, thank you.
01:40  rcjsuen: The problem only occurs with php files, correcft?
01:41  Mkop: as far as I can tell, correct.
01:41  Mkop: let me double check
01:41  rcjsuen: then yes it's most certainly a dupe
01:42  Mkop: yep. compare works on a non-PHP file but not on another PHP file
01:46  Mkop: what's the difference between RESOLVED and CLOSED?
01:48  RenatoSilva: Mkop: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/page.cgi?id=fields.html#status
01:49  rcjsuen: most projects I've encountered at Eclipse.org don't really distinguish a difference between RESOLVED or CLOSED

11:13  progre55: hi guys. using eclipse 3.5.2 on a 64bit ubuntu machine with java version "1.6.0_22". Right after starting eclipse, when I click on the "Project Explorer" button, eclipse freezes and doesnt respond to anything. Any ways to analyze this? or are there any know bugs?
11:14  progre55: known* )
11:36  csaba: progre55: you should have an error log in your workspace directory
11:41  progre55: csaba: oh thanks, let me see what it complains about..
11:43  csaba: workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.ui.workbench
11:44  progre55: csaba: I have it under workspace/.metadata/ and a file called .log
11:44  progre55: and it's some NPE
11:44  csaba: do you have something under workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.ui.workbench ?
11:44  progre55: let me see
11:44  csaba: there should be a file called log
11:44  csaba: not .log, just log
11:45  progre55: nope, there are just a couple of .xml files under ~/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/
11:45  csaba: then everything is ok :)
11:45  csaba: I don't know, try eclipse -debug
11:46  progre55: but anyways, in that .log file, I have an NPE, and it has something to do with the SVN plugins
11:47  csaba: if it helps you, great... but usually the log file on my computer is where I told you... maybe search the whole .metadata directory, maybe there are more log files
11:48  progre55: well, I tried googling, and it seems to be similar to this bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=299333
11:49  csaba: try removing subclipse?
11:49  csaba: or download a clean eclipse somewhere else and see if it runs
11:50  csaba: or maybe your workspace doesn't actually freeze, you just need to wait 5 min for subclipse to figure out it can't connect to some repository
11:50  progre55: csaba: thanks, I'll try that now
11:51  ronr_: progre55: can you pastebin the log?
11:51  progre55: csaba: yeah might be, let me just wait until it gets a connection timeout error
11:51  progre55: ronr_: sec
11:52  ronr_: yeah, I had problems with the maven plugin 'freezing' my eclipse.
11:52  csaba: but that's normal for m2eclipse :)
11:52  ronr_: yes, but I hate it.
11:52  ronr_: it freezes my eclipse all the time.
11:53  ronr_: hmpf.
11:53  progre55: ronr_: here is the error http://pastie.org/1378932
11:53  csaba: you should try running the gwt plugin in your maven project from eclipse... it takes all your cpu cores for several minutes and there's no way to stop it :D
11:54  ronr_: no, thanks ;)
11:54  progre55: hmm.. just paid attention to the date.. and it seems to be an old error or smth =)
11:54  csaba: run a fresh eclipse
11:54  ronr_: hehe
11:57  progre55: well, let me try it with a fresh eclipse
11:57  progre55: thanks for the attention guys, appreciate
11:58  ronr_: progre55: umm, dude, it's not for free. you gotta pay.
11:58  ronr_: progre55: lemme give you the paypal link.
11:58  ronr_: :p
11:58  progre55: ronr_: sure )
11:59  progre55: ronr_: and just in case, tell me how much you currently have on your account.. so that I dont waste my time just to get your 10 bucks ))
12:00  ronr_: progre55: I have nothing ;)
12:00  progre55: well, then I might even transfer you a buck out of pity =))
12:01  ronr_: hehe :p
12:01  ronr_: don't need your stinkin pitty ;)
12:01  progre55: :D
12:03  Elirips: Hello all. Can someone recommend me some books for an experienced java-programmer, that would like to get into Java EE with Eclipse and Apache Tomcat? No ideas of servlets, webapps, jsp, etc.
12:05  progre55: ronr_: anyways, I mean it, thanks for the help =) from the bottom of my heart ;)
12:06  ronr_: progre55: I've done absolutely nothing, but sure ;)
12:06  progre55: oh
12:06  progre55: csaba: thanks for the help =)
12:06  progre55: :D
12:06  ronr_: much better ;)
12:08  Elirips: And has anyone an idea about this eclipse nullpointer-exception: http://pastebin.com/Z39YbSxU ? It occurs, when I try to create a sample test-client using the wizard 'new webservice client'. My WSDL includes some complex types that can't be handlet, at the end it tells me that 'some methods have been omitted', but then it crashes with the exception above
12:39  csaba: what Listener should I use for a List, to detect when another item has been selected?
12:39  csaba: selectionlistener doesn't work...
12:41  rcjsuen: that's hard for me to believe
12:42  csaba: hmm now it started working :)

16:00  lu_: hey, every time i save, clean or otherwise change an android project i get the message: 'An internal error occurred during: "Refreshing external folders"'. I googled but I didn't find a way to fix this that worked. What causes this?
16:01  rcjsuen: Did you check in Bugzilla?
16:02  lu_: yes, there was a thread and they said it was fixed. that was 2008 or something. when i create a new project the error doesn't show up. the error comes when i have a project for a while. and as you can imagine it's REALLY annoying :)
16:02  csaba: I have my custom nature and launcher, and I've created my custom perspective... so how to add the Run button to the perspective which would run/create my custom launch configurations?
16:02  csaba: I thought that I need to create a LauncherShortcut... but that didn't do anything, there's still no Run button in my perspective
16:02  rcjsuen: the launch hsortcuts
16:02  rcjsuen: are for the context menus
16:03  rcjsuen: lu_: A thread, you mean a bug open?
16:03  lu_: it was closed
16:03  csaba: you mean in the "Run as" menu? It still doesn't show there...
16:04  rcjsuen: lu_: I take that to mean "yes, there was a bug open on the topic".
16:04  WolfDogDesigns: Hey all. where do i get a list of the software sites for the install bit in help? got a new eclipse install on win7 and the sites list is empty, need CDT
16:04  lu_: but i'm checking agin as of now
16:04  rcjsuen: csaba: No, context menu == secondary-click menu (right-click menu)
16:04  csaba: ok so how to add the run button?
16:04  rcjsuen: csaba: You mean the toolbar?
16:05  csaba: and the Run menu
16:05  rcjsuen: WolfDogDesigns: See FAQ in channel topic.
16:05  rcjsuen: <csaba> you mean in the "Run as" menu? It still doesn't show there...
16:05  rcjsuen: Do you mean the 'Run' menu is not there?
16:05  rcjsuen: Or the 'Run' menu is "empty"?
16:05  csaba: it has "External tools" and nothing else
16:06  WolfDogDesigns: rcjsuen: cheers, now checking
16:06  rcjsuen: for the toolbar case I'm pretty sure you need the debug/run action sets available
16:06  rcjsuen: you could declare that in your perspective i suppose
16:06  rcjsuen: look at how other ppl implement their perspective factories
16:06  rcjsuen: (like jdt)
16:06  csaba: ok
16:13  csaba: awesome, I just needed to add the LAUNCH_ACTION_SET
16:13  csaba: so how to add a Run As... item?
16:14  csaba: when a project has maven nature, it gets stuff like Run As... "maven build", maven package...
16:14  csaba: I want the same thing when a project has my custom nature
16:16  ronr_: java is going to kill me.
16:16  csaba: the coffee?
16:16  ronr_: the language
16:16  csaba: indonesian?
16:16  ronr_: and I'm going to kill you ;)
16:17  csaba: I might be your boss
16:17  ronr_: hmm, no.
16:17  csaba: please report to my office
16:18  csaba: you can also pack your things while you're at it
16:18  csaba: merry christmas
16:18  ronr_: seriously, though, I'm trying to do something that's absolutely impossible in java.
16:18  ronr_: hmpf.
16:18  csaba: what?
16:18  nitind: ronr_: cryptic much?
16:18  ronr_: csaba: you see, just now you gave away that you're not my boss by greeting me merry christmas ;)
16:18  ronr_: nitind: yes.
16:18  ronr_: :)
16:19  ronr_: I need to be able to either copy a whole object when I pass it to a different class, or be able to track the changes done to it when multiple classes change it (and see only the relevant changes in the relevant class).
16:20  nitind: You can clone() it...probably.  But usually tracking changes is done by the object letting others subscribe to those changes.  You know, how O-O is supposed to work.
16:21  ronr_: nope, clone()ing won't do. clone() on an ArrayList is not a proper solution, for example.
16:21  ronr_: that's just it, I need to be able to see the changes on object I didn't write.
16:22  ronr_: or copy them.
16:22  ronr_: imagine I pass an immutable object, and I need to make changes to it.
16:23  ronr_: ah, the silence :)
16:23  nitind: I'm not sure you're using encapsulation right, then.
16:24  ronr_: that may be because I'm not encapsulating anything.
16:24  rcjsuen: immutable...make changes...does not compute @_@
16:24  nitind: Are you a C programmar being forced to use Java?
16:25  ronr_: No.
16:25  ronr_: rcjsuen: of course. that's why I need to make a copy of it.
16:27  rcjsuen: If I make new Shells, and only ever use setVisible(false) but never dispose(), I suppose I would be leaking handles, correct?
16:27  nitind: rcjsuen: I should think so.
16:27  rcjsuen: just noticed some weird code
16:27  rcjsuen: it has dispose()
16:28  rcjsuen: on SWT.ESC keys and such, or enter (selection on list)
16:28  rcjsuen: but if the shell is deactivated it just goes setVisible(false0
16:28  nitind: ronr_: Any chance you can update this object in some way so that it can clone itself with the desired changes?
16:28  rcjsuen: but looking at the code a new dlg is created every time so it's not even reusing the "last" one
16:29  nitind: Bummer.
16:29  ronr_: nitind: not sure I follow your logic.
16:29  rcjsuen: yes it's definitely leaking (as confirmed by my primitive listeners and print statements) :o
16:29  nitind: ronr_: The immutable object's class would usually have a means to create a new instance with the properties you want.
16:34  ronr_: nitind: you're right, but it's a bit of a problem. we're trying to find a general solution for the problem, and there just isn't one.
16:34  ronr_: the problem surrounds the fact that I can't force objects to be immutable
16:34  ronr_: and I can't control jdk objects
16:35  ronr_: I don't even have to have objects immutable. I just need to make sure that if someone tries to change them, they end up getting a new copy of the object rather than changing the original copy.
16:35  ronr_: I have several classes looking at the same object, and I can't have a change in one class affect the other classes.
16:36  ronr_: and those classes in turn push the modified objects forward to other classes.
16:36  ronr_: I'm getting a headache.
16:44  ronr_: well, found a possible solution.
16:44  ronr_: not excited about it, but it's a solution.
16:45  WolfDogDesigns: Hey all. Ive unzipped and run a new install on Win7, do you need to link it up to C++ compilers etc? Cause in CDT I dont get any project settings like linker and include paths etc. Also no Debug/Release configurations
16:56  nitind: WolfDogDesigns: Are they C/C++ Projects?
16:57  WolfDogDesigns: nitind: Yup, s'a C++ projects
16:57  WolfDogDesigns: also, is there no installer version? Only a portable one in a zip?
16:58  sam[cOe]: Hi
16:59  sam[cOe]: Do you know process to execute a command in Eclipse on selected text ?  (like pep8)
17:01  nitind: WolfDogDesigns: That's all that Eclipse.org ever provides.  You might try Googleing for Wascana.
17:01  nitind: pep8?
17:08  WolfDogDesigns: nitind: hmm, fair enough, thas the installer, but on the zip verison, any idea about all the missing configuration bits?
17:08  nitind: WolfDogDesigns: nope
17:09  WolfDogDesigns: k, thanks anyway
17:19  rcjsuen: sam[cOe]: presumably your handler would retrieve the selection, then act on it in some fashion
17:20  sam[cOe]: nitind, pep8 (to check quality of python code)
17:21  sam[cOe]: rcjsuen, ?
17:25  rcjsuen: sam[cOe]: I thought you were writing a plug-in.
17:26  rcjsuen: you can use an external tool launch configuration to run something on a specified file anyway
17:26  sam[cOe]: rcjsuen, no solution for the moment ? even if it's complicated ?
17:26  WolfDogDesigns: has anyone had much luck getting CDT cimpiling with the VS compiler?
17:27  sam[cOe]: rcjsuen, http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/09/writing-pep8-aware-python-code-komodo
17:28  sam[cOe]: rcjsuen, ok it's not on selected text .. but it's so cool
17:35  gregor3005: hi, sry that i ask the following question but i found no solution and maybe its a noob question
17:36  gregor3005: how can i query a hsqldb for an id with the searchparam    like '%1%'
17:36  gregor3005: so that i get all ids like: 1, 10,11, ... 21, 31, ...
17:36  nitind: This might not be the best channel for that question.
17:36  gregor3005: i found "cast (id as string)" but it doesn't work
17:36  gregor3005: nitind: i know but these said in the first line
17:37  gregor3005: i asked it here because some people work with eclipse and java and sometimes with databases that uses sql-syntax
