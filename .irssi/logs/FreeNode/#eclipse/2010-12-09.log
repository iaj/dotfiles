23:02  iaj: lo there - what's the best way to set a workspace permanent? eg. remove the references to an old one?
23:08  rcjsuen: "Permanent"?
23:15  nitind: iaj: Check the Workspace preference page.  There should be an option to stop prompting.  Alternately, use the -data switch from the command line.

23:52  b2ag: 59 is the ascii-code for ";"
23:53  b2ag: no ideas? no one using dsf here reading this?
23:53  zanberdo: I'm all for 'RTFM' but it's usually helpful if the 'FM' actually has useful information.  It's okay though, as I've found through other resources that Eclipse uses whatever tooltip background color is defined by the OS and doesn't provide a means to change it just within Eclipse. Seems a bit short-sighted IMHO, but it is what it is.
23:55  rcjsuen: zanberdo: The FAQ entry's workaround didn't work out for you?
23:55  rcjsuen: altho i suppose that workaround would be for changing the OS colours, which doesn't satisfy your needs
23:57  zanberdo: I could not find any reference to my issue in the FAQ, but in my case I simply changed the OS tooltip background color, so it's fine. Just frustrating when Eclipse seems to have nearly every aspect of the color scheme configurable save this. No worries, don't want to bitch. problem solved.
