23:21  iaj: lo there :-)
23:21  iaj: where can I find a setting that updated files are getting reloaded automatically?
23:21  briandealwis: iaj: Preferences > Workspace > Refresh automatically
23:22  iaj: thats counting for open text editor windows as well?
23:22  iaj: thanks so far :-)
23:22  briandealwis: Eclipse may prompt you, IIRC
23:23  iaj: so I can't put that off?
23:23  rcjsuen: I don't think it applies for opened text editors.
23:23  iaj: since Im using VIM to change my files
23:23  iaj: oh.. thanks :D
23:23  briandealwis: iaj: File > Close All before using VIM
23:24  iaj: briandealwis: actually I'm using eclim in headed mode - so I use both at the same time...
23:24  iaj: vim for editing, and eclipse for debugging and stuff
