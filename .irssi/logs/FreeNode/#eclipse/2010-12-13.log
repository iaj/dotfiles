11:40  dada|2: Hello
11:41  dada|2: My JavaDoc completion is disabled in Eclipse, it worked... and it stopped to work for an unknow reason... Can someone help me ?
11:42  dada|2: In fact it works on Java classes, but not on ActionScript classes
11:46  Symbi0nt: can I close a project from outside eclipse?
11:46  Symbi0nt: So that when Eclipse starts the projects is not opend and parsed
12:16  csaba: Symbi0nt: probably, analyze the workspace directory
12:41  Symbi0nt: $this->mClick->getCollection()->addFieldToFilter('createat', $dateDelta)->addFilter('click_affiliate', $affiliate_id)->addFilter('click_type', 1)->count(); Wie kann cih bei so einer Anfrage den SQL Query sehen.
12:41  Symbi0nt: wriong channel sorry
12:41  ronr_: you don't say..
12:55  csaba: when I press F5 in eclipse, there's a little "busy
12:55  csaba: " pointer showing up
12:55  csaba: how to do that?
12:57  Aleph_One: does egit/jgit support self signed certificates somehow? I'm using latest nightly build of EGit and get a certification error message back.
12:58  Aleph_One: perhaps a sslVerify=false flag?
13:24  UrsoBranco: hi ppl, where can I find some links to the osgi.console.encoding and which encodings it support? I've googled a bit and couldn't find a list of encodings :(
13:27  briandealwis: UrsoBranco: I think it supposed anything supported by file.encoding: http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html
13:28  briandealwis: UrsoBranco: UTSL: http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/incubator/security/codescans/viewcvs.php?projectName=org.eclipse.osgi&packageName=org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core&fileName=FrameworkConsole.java&sourceFolder=/console/src/&repositoryRoot=Eclipse_Project&linenumber=123
13:28  briandealwis: It just passes the value to an InputStreamReader
13:32  ronr_: Aleph_One: if you manage to get egit working, I'd appreciate help ;)
13:32  rcjsuen: csaba: there are various apis that offer that
13:32  rcjsuen: a) change the cursor directly, b) use BusyIndicator, c) use IProgressService, and probably other options
13:32  csaba: I probably need the BusyIndicator
13:33  Aleph_One: ronr_: you mean with the ssl verify stuff? yes would be nice, cant find any info at the project pages either..
13:33  Aleph_One: probably set up the projects when i get home and have a look in the code
13:34  ronr_: Aleph_One: trying to get it to work against github with no luck :-/
13:34  Aleph_One: ronr_: what's your error message?
13:34  Aleph_One: do you use cygwin?
13:34  ronr_: on linux? no :p
13:35  Aleph_One: hehe ok
13:35  ronr_: I don't remember the error message, let me check again.

13:40 --- Channel #eclipse was synced in 124 seconds
13:41  ronr_: Aleph_One: sec, sorry, distracted by someone
13:42  UrsoBranco: briandealwis: thanks a lot
13:47  ronr_: Aleph_One: out of curiosity, what's up with your nick?
13:52  Aleph_One: ronr_: nothing really.. just been like that for a while so
13:52  ronr_: Aleph_One: just surprised by the Aleph part :)
13:52  Aleph_One: why?
13:53  ronr_: just not commonly used by non-Hebrew speakers.
13:53  ronr_: or insane mathematicians.
13:54  Aleph_One: i have heard the math ting before.. hopefully i'm not insane though
13:56  ronr_: Aleph Zero, Aleph One and so on are measures of infinity.
13:56  ronr_: and so on..
13:57  ronr_: hmpf, I think I've uninstalled egit.. need to re-install it.
13:57  UrsoBranco: ronr_: what happens if two Aleph's are added ? :P
13:58  Aleph_One: the universe will probably explode :P
13:58  ronr_: UrsoBranco: I'm not really a mathematician, so I can't say.
13:58  UrsoBranco: LOL
13:58  UrsoBranco: ronr_: it was supposed to be a joke :D, Aleph_One got it :D
13:59  ronr_: I may be too thick for that.
13:59  ronr_: crap, I started the wrong eclipse instance.
14:00  Aleph_One: ronr_: you can try performing a git clone from command line, just to see if the auth thing works
14:00  Aleph_One: it will prompt you for the password
14:00  ronr_: Aleph_One: from command line everything works.
14:00  Aleph_One: ah ok!
14:01  ronr_: Aleph is also the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
14:01  Aleph_One: wonder if it is a basic/digest thingie
14:01  ronr_: basic/digest?
14:02  Aleph_One: the authentication EGit uses is probably using "Basic Authentication" or "Digest Authentication"
14:02  Aleph_One: and hopefully github is using the same
14:02  Aleph_One: i am using Basic on my server
14:02  ronr_: ah, no.. github uses ssl.
14:03  Aleph_One: yes, but that is only for the transport part, not authentication
14:03  ronr_: not sure about the authentication. there's a certificate exchange, but I'm not sure if it's for encryption, authentication or both.
14:03  ronr_: I really hate security.
14:04  ronr_: it's important and all, but I just want it to work.
14:04  Aleph_One: read githubs FAQ
14:04  Aleph_One: there must be some info about it
14:04  ronr_: they mock eclipse users.
14:04  ronr_: I've spent hours on it.
14:04  ronr_: and the egit mailing list wasn't helpful, unfortunately.
14:04  Aleph_One: ronr_: are you using the nighly build of EGit?
14:04  ronr_: oh well, maybe I just won't use it at all.
14:05  Aleph_One: The 0.9 version does not support authentication
14:05  ronr_: I've tried both the latest stable and the nightly.
14:12  monochrome: can anyone point me to the developer's guide of WTP? Been looking for it .. the link in the website is broken
14:15  nitind: Which link is that?
14:17  nitind: monochrome: I think you have to look at the titles in http://help.eclipse.org/helios/ directly. The WST/JST designation's not used any more for that sort of thing.
14:18  monochrome: nitind, the developer's guide isn't there .. only the user's guide ..
14:19  csaba: in plugin.xml I wrote a new <command> and a <handler> for it... I wrote the AbstractHandler class... then I want to execute it from java code like this:
14:19  monochrome: nitind, i was referring to this link -> http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.wst.doc.isv/html/plugin_descriptions_WST/wst.html
14:19  csaba: service = getSite().getService(IHandlerService.class);
14:19  monochrome: which is on http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/documentation/
14:19  csaba: service.executeCommand("the.command.id")
14:19  csaba: but I get a "command not found" error
14:20  csaba: what did I do wrong?
14:20  nitind: csaba: If you've ever launched that runtime workspace before, check that the configuration area is being cleared (it's a separate option from clearing the workspace) on the launcher's Configuration tab.
14:21  csaba: ah ok, it did execute
14:21  csaba: there was a nullpointerexception in the handler
14:21  nitind: monochrome: A lot of that seems to be under the Reference sections of the User Guides.
14:22  monochrome: nitind, checking ...
14:28  csaba: if I have an AbstractHandler, then what is the best way to deliver an object to it? For example, let's say I want to service.executeCommand("command.id", myObj)
14:29  paulweb515: csaba: programmatically?
14:29  csaba: yes
14:30  csaba: I see that in the AbstractHandler, I get an event object.. which has a parameters Map, which contains strings
14:30  csaba: but I want to send objects, not strings
14:30  paulweb515: csaba: just a sec (I just shut down my eclipse :-)
14:30  csaba: cool :)
14:35  paulweb515: csaba: here's one way:  IEvaluationContext ctx = hs.getCurrentState();  ctx.addVariable("org.example.myObj", myObj); hs.executeCommandInContext(parmCmd, null, ctx);
14:35  csaba: ok and what is hs?
14:35  csaba: ah, the service
14:35  paulweb515: csaba: it might be sufficient to add the variable and then call hs.executeCommand("id", null)
14:36  paulweb515: IHandlerService
14:36  csaba: ok so on the other side, in the abstracthandler, how to get the object from the context?
14:36  rcjsuen: use HandlerUtil to get the variable from the event
14:37  csaba: ah cool!
14:37  monochrome: still no luck in finding the developer's guide for WTP
14:37  monochrome: :D
14:37  paulweb515: org.eclipse.ui.handlers.HandlerUtil.getVariable(Object, String)
14:37  csaba: thanks both of you you're awesome! :)
14:45  ronr_: Aleph_One: it worked!!!!!
14:45  ronr_: Aleph_One: I think.
14:46  ronr_: maybe not.
14:46  ronr_: hmpf.
14:49  ronr_: Well, it doesn't give me an error message but I think I'm doing something wrong.
14:57  Aleph_One: ronr_: check your .log perhaps there is something interesting
14:58  ronr_: Aleph_One: I really think it's a matter of knowing how to use it. I'm very new to the whole git world.
14:59  Aleph_One: i haven't used egit before, but perhaps there is something that it relies on having a .project file in the repo.
15:11  ronr_: Aleph_One: don't think so, not sure about the whole pulling, fetching, pushing, cloning, committing stuff.
15:14  paulweb515: ronr_: what version of EGit are you using?  I've been using the latest nightly builds, always.  Although they're planning to "release" 0.10 this week
15:18  DarkOpz: Is this channel appropriate for RCP question or is there a specific channel for that?
15:20  rcjsuen: DarkOpz: Ask here or on the ~fourms
15:20  DarkOpz: ok I'll just put it out there. Been trying to read up on disabling plugins based on permissions I setup inside the RCP application. Anyone have luck with that? It seems that isnt possible right now in 3.4
15:21  Aleph_One: paulweb515: do you know if there is a similar way to handle self signed certificates in EGit/JGit as in git (http.sslverify or GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY)
15:21  DarkOpz: I was thinking I might be able to overright the Jar loaders of the plugins and have the plugins either encrypted or do a simple fail inside the Jar loaders if the permissions are incorrect.
15:21  DarkOpz: wow overwrite, its too cold here.
15:21  paulweb515: Aleph_One: my connections go through the same code as the CVS ssh code, AFAIK
15:22  Aleph_One: ok
15:22  paulweb515: Aleph_One: or do you mean for using git with HTTPS ?
15:22  Aleph_One: for using HTTPS
15:22  paulweb515: ah, I'm using SSH
15:22  Aleph_One: i want to give the smart-http a try
15:22  paulweb515: Aleph_One: you might have to ask on the egit mailing list.  They just implemented HTTPS support recently
15:22  Aleph_One: ok
15:23  Aleph_One: i know that it's possible to import the certificates key but that is a bit messy compared to how other tools normally handled self signed certs
15:24  DarkOpz: You're trying to create and import a self-signed CA into your system so you don't need to use the standard CA's to authenticate your certificates?
15:24  DarkOpz: Just jumped in on this conversation so I apologize if I am off base.
15:25  Aleph_One: DarkOpz: since i use a self signed certificate on my server, i want clients to say that it's ok to connect to that server anyway.
15:26  Aleph_One: when using subclipse fx i think a question pops up the first time, so the user may choose to trust the connection or not.
15:27  Aleph_One: I want to avoid the extra steps to manually import the cert into the jvms keystore
15:27  DarkOpz: You need to import that self-signed CA into your local machines pkstore.
15:27  DarkOpz: ah ok
15:28  Aleph_One: git support http.sslverify, i want similar option for EGit :)
15:29  DarkOpz: I believe you can override the authentication process and just validate the certificates yourself if it uses Java JCA
15:29  Aleph_One: DarkOpz: i can probably start hacking the JGit stuff, but i don't wanna go there yet if that is what you mean?
15:31  DarkOpz: While I havent had to do this specifically I've done similar things before. If JGit uses JCA for it's crypto you can create your own provider that adapts existing providers but always passes authentication. This might help, http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/HowToImplAProvider.html#Step1
15:31  DarkOpz: I wouldnt expect JGit would want you to do it this way though, I imagine there is an easier way.
15:33  Aleph_One: DarkOpz: ok, i have written some stuff about it as well, but i wanted to figure out if it was possible to make it work by plain configuration first
15:33  Aleph_One: seems not
15:34  DarkOpz: Seems like it would be a great expansion to JGit to allow it to act like SSH, where you are allowed to import server certificates if the user says they trust them.
15:35  Aleph_One: for HTTPS its just a matter of setting up the communication i guess, not handling the actual authentication
15:35  Aleph_One: gotta go now, thanks for the tips anyway!
15:36  Aleph_One: (user authentication that is and not machine auth)
15:37  DarkOpz: Anyone use Eclipse JAAS to disable/block plugins from loading?
15:40  ronr_: paulweb515: I updated to the latest nightly earlier and it seems much better. had  lots of problems with it before.
15:40  ronr_: paulweb515: unfortunately, while not I don't get an authentication error, I don't know how to make it actually work.
15:49  javahorn: hi
15:49  javahorn: how to convert java project into eclipse plugin project?
15:52  DarkOpz: It depends on what you are trying to do. You can create a new project using the Plugin Development project type, then copy over your source code into the new project. Or you can JAR your existing project files, and set them as a dependency in a new plugin project. At the very least you need a new project of the plugin type.
15:53  paulweb515: javahorn: right click on the project, there should be a Configure submenu
15:57  javahorn: Thanks DarkOpz
15:59  javahorn: paulweb515: it does not create plugin.xml
16:00  javahorn: though it creates MANIFEST
16:00  paulweb515: javahorn: adding an extension will create the plugin.xml
16:01  DarkOpz: There are issues if the project isnt' already a plugin "type". Eclipse won't know to load the specific plugin editors. If the project was already a plugin type, then yes adding an extension will create a plugin.xml.
16:06  javahorn: paulweb515: singleton
16:06  javahorn: true value indicates what?
16:07  javahorn: there was error and added that , gone!
16:07  paulweb515: javahorn: any eclipse plugin that provides extensions or extension points is marked as a singleton.  That means only one version of it installed in the platform at a time
16:09  javahorn: ok thanks paulweb515
16:11  samuell: join #eclipse-dev
16:13  samuell: Hi, I want to include the Remote System Explorer (RSE) as a plugin in an Eclipse RCP application (and make other plugins that does things via RSE) ... but I can't really find how to get started ...
