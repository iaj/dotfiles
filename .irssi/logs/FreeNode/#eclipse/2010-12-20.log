00:32  RedEyess: when using Eclipse 3.6.1 under Linux
00:32  trauler: sillence people
00:32  RedEyess: I get the following error when deploying a static web project
00:32  RedEyess: Error copying file index.php: No such file or directory
00:32  trauler: RedEyess:  ??? to me?
00:32  RedEyess: to a server
00:32  RedEyess: silence?
00:32  trauler: php under eclipse
00:32  RedEyess: why?
00:32 --- Channel #eclipse was synced in 133 seconds
00:32  RedEyess: trauler: yes
00:33  trauler: I never used php under eclip[se... only c++ )) and java
00:33  RedEyess: ok
00:33  trauler: php with notepad++
00:33  RedEyess: but it could be an html file too
00:33  RedEyess: yep
00:33  RedEyess: or vim
00:33  RedEyess: but i am trying out eclipse
00:33  RedEyess: and under Linux
00:34  RedEyess: i can run the application fine under the root user
00:34  RedEyess: i have given the http doc root permissions to my regular user
00:34  RedEyess: i mean i can deploy fine under root but NOT as a regular user
00:35  RedEyess: i am guessing that eclipse is copying the files to somewhere else first before deploying to my http doc root
00:37  RedEyess: NetBeans is able to deploy properly
00:37  RedEyess: will be back

10:21  _kud: I've a little problem with egit
10:21  _kud: when i go to history, as i'm french, i use some é è etc
10:21  _kud: but egit seems to dislike it, charset problem
10:21  _kud: any idea? i'm on macos
10:22  z4z4: _kud: what do you see instead?
10:22  z4z4: "e" or some rubbish?
10:22  _kud: Sacr√©
10:23  _kud: :)
10:23  _kud: i thought i was in utf-8 and maybe egit is in iso-8859-1
10:23  _kud: my projects are in utf-8
10:23  z4z4: what about your team mates on different OSes? what do they see?
10:23  _kud: I work alone, hehe ;)
10:24  z4z4: have you checked if there is a bug for that against EGit?
10:24  _kud: nope, gotta check
10:26  z4z4: it looks like a bug to me, if there is none filed already. I would open a new one
10:26  _kud: yep
10:26  ronr_: could it be a git repository configuration though?
10:27  z4z4: _kus is that a local repo?
10:27  ronr_: try checking if you get the same problem from command line
10:27  _kud: yeah it is z4z4
10:27  _kud: okay
10:28  _kud: no problem via terminal
10:29  _kud: it's a egit/eclipse problem
10:29  z4z4: good point, you could also try cloning a repo from github.com and see what happens
10:29  _kud: yeah
10:30  ronr_: well, if it's on github, I imagine that when you look at things over at github, everything looks fine?
10:31  ronr_: _kud: I can check it over in my egit if you explain me what to do. I can use non-english characters as well.
10:31  _kud: alreet
10:31  _kud: just use character like é à è
10:31  _kud: in your commit comment
10:32  _kud: and go to history tab to see the comment
10:32  ronr_: ok, let me check.
10:32  _kud: by the way, do you have any idea on windows how not to use master password
10:33  _kud: it asks me everytime the password, I don't want it, i'd like to keep ftp passwords without having to type the master password
10:33  ronr_: no, not sure about that.
10:34  _kud: I don't have this feature on my macos
10:34  _kud: same version of eclipse though
10:36  ronr_: _kud: I see Hebrew in the history tab with no problem...
10:36  ronr_: and that's definitely not ISO-8859-1 ;)
10:36  _kud: alreet
10:36  _kud: weird
10:36  _kud: are you on macos?
10:37  ronr_: of course not
10:37  ronr_: I have to go for a few.. sorry. hope you work it out :)
10:39  _kud: http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/8713/capturedcran20101220103.png
10:39  _kud: no problem, cheers anyway!
10:50  wink: hello, anyone got a pointer regarding opening a file with AbstractTextEditor and then the editor for the wrong language is being opened?
11:06  xerox1: hi, i am having an issue with saving after editing conflicts with svn-plugin; isn't it possible to save the changes made to the local file?
11:21  mh82: hey there, can anyone help me out with BORT
11:21  mh82: BIRT Designer 2.5.1

11:39  timing: how can I trigger a directory refresh after I run an external command ?
11:40  timing: o lol, refresh resources upon completio :-)
12:43  LabMonkey: I don't know how
12:43  LabMonkey: but somehow I've broken my WTP
12:43  LabMonkey: if I try to create a new project, there's no Web section
12:44  LabMonkey: only General, CVS, Java, and Examples
13:02  sherbieny: anyone knows sphinx4
13:02  sherbieny: anyone knows sphinx4
13:02  sherbieny: anyone knows sphinx4
13:02  sherbieny: anyone knows sphinx4
13:24  ronr_: _kud: did you manage to solve the problem?
13:25  _kud: not yet, i've submitted a bug on bugzilla, ronr_
13:25  sherbieny: anyone knows how to test sphinx4 performance
13:25  ronr_: _kud: you think it's macos specific?
13:25  _kud: yep
13:25  _kud: for sho!
13:26  ronr_: _kud: there's a simple solution to that, you know....
13:26  _kud: using command lines?
13:26  _kud: :D
13:26  ronr_: using a real os ;)
13:26  _kud: ahha
13:26  _kud: which one?
13:26  _kud: And macos uses unix
13:27  ronr_: anything that's not manufactured by apple.
13:27  ronr_: ;)
13:27  _kud: + i'm at work, i cant choose my os
13:27  _kud: i dislike apple you know :)
13:27  ronr_: I thought you work alone
13:27  _kud: yeah I do
13:27  _kud: i'm in a small web agency
13:27  _kud: and i work alone on my projects
13:27  _kud: :D
13:27  ronr_: hehe
13:27  ronr_: well, screw your bosses then :)
13:27  _kud: ahah should I
13:28  ronr_: well, you shouldn't.. if you want to keep your job ;)
13:28  _kud: that's right dude :)
13:28  _kud: anyway command lines work perfectly
13:28  _kud: it's an egit problem
13:28  ronr_: it's odd that it'd be a macos specific bug though
13:28  _kud: i've asked to a friend who loves apple and uses egit too
13:28  _kud: i'll have an answer soon
13:29  sherbieny: i need to open something like HelloWorld and start saying the sentences and get some results like error report
13:30  ronr_: _kud: btw, in the little preview thingie in the history tab (or whatever it is) do you also not see the french characters?
13:30  _kud: yep
13:30  _kud: all the history window is bugged as hel
13:30  _kud: l
13:30  ronr_: could it be that you can't type? :P
13:31  _kud: han!
13:31  _kud: bastard
13:31  _kud: ;)
13:31  ronr_: try adding שקר כלשהו to the comment, and see what you get as a result.
13:31  _kud: yeah
13:31  ronr_: hebrew would look a lot more distincitve.
13:33  _kud: i've commit but see nothing in history
13:33  ronr_: well, hebrew has a tendency to be invisible.
13:33  ronr_: :p
13:33  ronr_: I imagine that if you type it in a file, you don't have a problem seeing it (within eclipse)...
13:35  ronr_: I say, run a VM on your macos, install linux, and work on it there :)
13:40  csaba: I would like to create a launcher that opens an IOConsole, where it would start a shell command, the user would use that, and after a while stop it
13:40  csaba: the problem I'm having is, that I cannot open the console
13:40  csaba: I need to get the active page of the active window from the current workspace
13:40  csaba: and for some reason, that is null
13:41  csaba: but if I try to do workspace.getwindows()[0] then that will work, except I'll get some SWT Thread exception...
13:41  csaba: so, simply, how to open a Console from a launcher and have a Process read/write to it?
13:43  ronr_: quite simple.
13:45  csaba: uh, well how? I reused the code from a wizard, where I could open a console window without any problems
13:45  csaba: but here, I have the problem with this activeWindow and activePage
13:46  ronr_: umm, I have no idea :p
13:46  ronr_: eclipse programming always seemed way too complicated to me :)
13:47  ronr_: rcjsuen!
13:47  csaba: ah he knows everything
13:47  ronr_: maybe he's a she?
13:48  csaba: maybe she's a he
13:48  ronr_: mayhaps.
13:48  rcjsuen: if you're not on the UI thread, getAWW() and getAP() returns null
13:48  csaba: so how to be in the UI thread?
13:49  rcjsuen: ~uithread
13:49  Arbalest: Getting "Invalid thread access" errors? See here - http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#uithread
13:49  rcjsuen: Use an (a)syncExec
13:49  rcjsuen: UIJob
13:49  rcjsuen: WorkbenchJob
13:50  csaba: hmm but I don't think that I have access to Display... since this is a LauncherDelegate, which is supposed to be non-ui... I think this is the main problem here
13:50  rcjsuen: ask the workbench for one
13:50  csaba: ah ok
13:51  csaba: wb.getDisplay()
13:51  csaba: cool thanks
13:52  sherbieny: anyone knows about sphinx
13:53  ronr_: sherbieny: why ask here? this is not the "sphinx channel".
13:53  sherbieny: there is no one replying on cmusphinx
13:54  sherbieny: I figured someone here knows about it
13:55  sherbieny: ronr_: do you know sphinx4?
13:59  ronr_: why would anyone know about it here? you can join #cassandra, ask there, and it'll be just as odd.
14:01  sherbieny: ronr_: I figured it is integrated into eclipse so maybe someone here used it
14:02  ronr_: huh.
14:02  sherbieny: right, so anyone here knows sphinx4
14:03  csaba: haha my console worx!
14:19  ronr_: csaba: what kind of application are you building?
14:20  csaba: a development environment
14:20  ronr_: for...?
14:34  csaba: nuclear power plants

14:49  serard: hello
14:50  serard: does eGit manage sub-git ? I have a project git-managed and it contains sub-folders which are themselves clones of other projects
15:03  jf_: i have got a question about extending and integrating birt is here the right place to ask?
15:04 --- petr is now known as Guest96572
15:06 --- Guest96572 is now known as trauler
15:08  rcjsuen: jf_: You'll probably have better luck in the forums.
15:08  jf_: i already tried them :-P
15:11  csaba: what's birt?
15:14  aeurielesn: !birt
15:14  Arbalest: Looking for help with Eclipse BIRT (http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/)? Try asking on the ~newsgroup or surf around BIRT Exchange (http://www.birt-exchange.com/be/home/).
15:15  javahorn: hi
15:15  javahorn: java.lang.RuntimeException: Application "com.xxx.yyy." could not be found in the registry. The applications available are: org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner, org.eclipse.equinox.app.error.
15:15  javahorn: what can be reason?
15:15  aeurielesn: check your run configuration, nothing else.
15:16  aeurielesn: (or product export configuration)
15:20  javahorn: aeurielesn: where is this pec?
15:21  javahorn: i ran configurations, added required plugins, it works now
15:21  javahorn: but where is the latter?
15:22  aeurielesn: in case you have a *.product you were missing something in your plugins/features/dependencies to be exported
15:23  aeurielesn: but i supossed checking your run configuration would suffix
15:23  aeurielesn: it seems i was right
15:52 --- csaba2 is now known as csaba
16:05  csaba: if I have an IRunnablewithProgress, then how to run it? From a wizard, I could do getContainer().run(...) but now I'm in an ILaunchconfigurationDelegate which doesn't have this...
16:05  Steve973: is this the right place to ask questions about certain eclipse plugins?
16:05  csaba: which one?
16:05  Steve973: eclipse-cs
16:06  sasori: question: how to install java/jdk/jre in windows 64bit ? ,,, i downloaded eclipse for php 64bit version and it won't run XD
16:06  csaba: you'd probably get an answer quicker if you asked on their mailing list...
16:06  Steve973: well I'll try here, and if someone doesn't have the answer, I'll try your suggestion
16:06  csaba: sasori: download jdk 1.6 for windows 64bit...
16:07  Steve973: it's telling me that my log4j.properties file doesn't end with a newline, and it clearly does.  any way to figure out why this is happening?
16:07  csaba: sure, I'm just saying, this place is pretty quiet...
16:07  sasori: csaba: i downloaded the latest jdk from oracle, i installed  it properly
16:07  sasori: how bout the environment variables ? how to set that up in 64bit ?
16:07  csaba: sasori: open a console and type javac -version
16:08  csaba: what do you see?
16:08  sasori: csaba: after typing that, i saw javac 1.6.0_23
16:08  csaba: ok so it won't run... how?
16:09  sasori: 1 sec..lemme click my eclipse
16:10  sasori: am getting this error pop up that says "Failed to load the JNI shared library 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin\..\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll".  that's the exact message
16:10  sasori: i haven't had any problem like this before :|
16:10  rcjsuen: csaba: Why do you have an IRWP in your ILCD
16:11  rcjsuen: sasori: There should be more than just one line
16:11  csaba: rcjsuen: I try to launch the application, but then I find out it's not built yet... so I want to run the builder first, with a progressMonitor
16:13  csaba: this is still happening inside the Display.asyncExec() method...
16:13  rcjsuen: isn't building before launching a preference
16:14  csaba: uhh... I don't actually have a builder... I just need to run an external command, that is all, and when it's finished, the app is built... I saw what the builder code looks like and decided to try and skip it
16:14  sasori: csaba:  , rcjsuen  any idea why am i getting this error also ? http://i51.tinypic.com/j9tuok.jpg
16:14  csaba: so it doesn't actually build in a classic sense
16:15  csaba: sasori: I think you might have more than 1 java installed
16:15  rcjsuen: http://help.eclipse.org/helios/nftopic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/debug/core/model/ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2.html#buildForLaunch%28org.eclipse.debug.core.ILaunchConfiguration,%20java.lang.String,%20org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor%29
16:15  rcjsuen: but it sounds like it doesn't apply for you
16:15  csaba: sasori: try uninstalling all javas you have on your comp and then install one from scratch
16:16  csaba: I actually have a checkbox (which I made) that says "build before run", this is optional for the user... but it would do the same thing as that method I guess....
16:16  rcjsuen: whoops, just realized you were using javac
16:16  sasori: am running windows 7 64bit, I checked the 'Java' directory under program files, i can see jdk1.6.0.23 and jre6 folders, those are different from each other correct ?
16:17  rcjsuen: anyway, yes, i would unintall/resinstall if i were you
16:17  csaba: the problem is, just how to run an external command now? I mean, with a progressmonitor
16:18  csaba: I just want this: IRunnableWithProgress op = ...; getcontainer.run(op, true, true);
16:18  csaba: the problem is, I don't have the getcontainer() part...
16:19  rcjsuen: look for other implementations then
16:23  csaba: maybe I can make a new command and then do the implementation in the handler... that worked before I guess...
16:24  rcjsuen: and where would youget an IRunnableContext in your handler?
16:25  aeurielesn: how to differentiate when the shell is disposed through clicking the close button or by calling shell.dispose() ? does DisposeEvent contains information to handle this?
16:25  rcjsuen: aeurielesn: Hint, there's another event for the X button
16:33  _kud: what's the key for commenting a block in eclipse?
16:33  _kud: on macos
16:36  csaba: ctrl-shift-c
16:38  rcjsuen: aeurielesn: It's SWT.Close, if you haven't figured it out yet.
16:44  _kud: I get a list of commands csaba
16:44  _kud: but no "comment these lines"
16:44  csaba: then you're not using eclipse
16:45  rcjsuen: _kud: What are you programming i
16:45  ronr_: _kud: try ctrl+/
16:45  _kud: I've too many plugins I think
16:45  _kud: I'm on Mac OS, I've got Aptana, Zen Coding, Eclipse Classic
16:45  _kud: Sometimes I've some binds conflicts
16:46  _kud: i'm programming in php on aptana editor (as plugin, not standalone)
16:47 * ronr_ sighs
16:47  ronr_: people should stop using php.
16:47  _kud: I use python and ruby at home dude
16:47  _kud: I have to eat you know ;)
16:47  _kud: I use symfony and it's really correct
16:47  _kud: but ain't my problem her
16:47  _kud: e
16:48  ronr_: did you try the ctrl+/?
16:48  _kud: yep
16:49  _kud: i know this bind, it works at home with my windows
16:49  _kud: but on macos, it erases the lines and does ":"
16:49  _kud: ;)
16:49  ronr_: screw your macos.
16:49  ronr_: seriously.
16:49  _kud: Ahah ;)
16:49  _kud: I'd love too
16:50  ronr_: try ctrl+shift+L and look for the shortcut.
16:50  _kud: alreet
