16:06  vwegert: This might be a dumb question, but how do I access the progress monitor of a WizardDialog from within the wizard page?
16:06  vwegert: ronr_: Yes
16:23 --- kriggs_ is now known as kriggs
16:28  vwegert: Can I somehow tell Eclipse to report an error whenever I use String.isEmpty()?
16:31  ronr_: because String.isEmpty() is bad?
16:31  vwegert: ronr_: because it doesn't exist in Java 5
16:32  ronr_: then set the compiler compliance of the project to java 5
16:33  vwegert: It is
16:33  RenatoSilva: I don't believe you
16:33  ronr_: apparently, it's not
16:34  vwegert: Or rather, J2SE-1.5
16:34  ronr_: nope, it's not.
16:34 * vwegert shrugs
16:35  ronr_: shrug all you want, you're the one with the problem :)
16:36  vwegert: Yep, but I dont' have to bother with people who don't believe things I clearly see.
16:36  ronr_: it's obvious you see it, but you may be looking at the wrong place.
16:38  jongw: Execution Environments
16:39  jongw: I wrote a blog about it: http://industrial-tsi-wim.blogspot.com/2009/10/eclipse-api-tools-execution.html
16:39  ronr_: jongw: is that like the place people get killed?
16:39  jongw: only bad people
16:39  jongw: and smart asses
16:40  jongw: vwegert: got it?
16:41  vwegert: jongw: Yep
16:45  vwegert: jongw: Works perfectly, thanks!
16:47  jongw: vwegert: you're welcome
16:48  jongw: ronr: Yes, you can import/export preferences
16:49  jongw: ronr: File/Export/General/Preferences
17:08  RenatoSilva: ronr_, jongw ?
17:08  jongw: yes?
17:08  RenatoSilva: ?
17:09  RenatoSilva: he said compliance was set to J2SE-1.5
17:09  RenatoSilva: that sounds like an EE not compiler compliance
17:09  jongw: ronr_: File/Export/General/Preferences
17:10  RenatoSilva: then you show a blog entry about EEs
17:10  RenatoSilva: then he's happy
17:10  RenatoSilva: this si crazy
17:10  RenatoSilva: * this is crazy
17:11  jongw: RenatoSilva: compliance level does not help in his case
17:11  RenatoSilva: jongw: duh!!! true, my bad
17:12 * RenatoSilva is not drunk
17:18  ronr_: RenatoSilva ?
17:19  RenatoSilva: ronr_: ^^^
17:19  ronr_: you want me to read back? hmpf.
17:20  ronr_: RenatoSilva: ok, no idea what just happened here.
17:21  RenatoSilva: ronr_: nevermind ronr_
17:21  ronr_: yes! nm me!
17:21  RenatoSilva: ronr_: missing methods is not a compiler but jre issue
17:21  RenatoSilva: ronr_: I should have believe him
17:23  ronr_: RenatoSilva: why? he wants an error on complication. that's got nothing to do with the jre.
17:33  danimoth: hi, I'm trying to compiling eclipse from source
17:33  danimoth: I have a problem in symlinkDeps target
17:34  danimoth: build.xml:345: Could not find suitable system JAR for org.apache.commons.el_1.0.0.v200806031608.jar.  Tried:  /usr/share/java/commons-el.jar
17:34  danimoth: but I have installed in /usr/share/java/commons-el.jar the jar from apache project
17:35  ronr_: did you check the file permissions?
17:36  danimoth: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 110K Dec 19 17:20 /usr/share/java/commons-el.jar
17:36  RenatoSilva: ronr_: it does have to do with the jre not compiler
17:36  RenatoSilva: ronr_: iirc there hasn't been any language changes in java 6
17:37  RenatoSilva: ronr_: his problem was to give an error for a method he knows to not be present in Java 5
17:38  ronr_: ronr_: it's not present in Java 5 nor 6 nor 4 nor any other?
17:38  RenatoSilva: ronr_: a missing method is not a compiler error, it's a lib error, the method doesn't exist in the lib. For that happening, he should use Java 5 JRE not higher as he was doing
17:38  danimoth: me ?
17:38  ronr_: danimoth: well, hell if I know.
17:38  ronr_: err.. no.. that was to RenatoSilva.
17:39  RenatoSilva: ronr_: but he wanted an error, which suggests it wasn't giving an error, which suggests whatever runtime he was using, that method existed there
17:39  RenatoSilva: ronr_: what was the method? I forgot and cleared the screen
17:40  ronr_: RenatoSilva: so fine, he had the wrong JRE in his Java Build Path. There. You were right, I was wrong. Happy now? :)
17:40  danimoth: I'm using the openjdk
17:40  danimoth: what is the list of dependencies of eclipse?
17:40  ronr_: String.isEmpty()
17:42  ronr_: RenatoSilva: so that was added in Java 6 (hah! a language change b/w 5 and 6)
17:42  ronr_: vwegert: that could be your problem though.
17:44  RenatoSilva: ronr_: I'm not really disputing, just trying to clarify things :) See, Java 6 has included that method: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#isEmpty%28%29
17:44  ronr_: RenatoSilva: I know. that's what I just said.
17:44  ronr_: :p
17:46  vwegert: ronr_: just to reiterate: 16:31:30 < vwegert> ronr_: because it doesn't exist in Java 5
17:46  RenatoSilva: danimoth: why do you want to build "eclipse"?
17:47  ronr_: vwegert: right. but did you manage to get the problem solved?
17:47  danimoth: because on my architecture (powerpc) there isn't a build
17:47  danimoth: I'm using archlinuxPPC
17:47  vwegert: I'd say the Eclipse Java compiler itself uses the RT it was launched with itself as a baseline unless specified otherwise
17:47  vwegert: ronr_: 16:45:48 < vwegert> jongw: Works perfectly, thanks!
17:48  ronr_: vwegert: ah, sorry, missed it. and regarding the baseline, I'm fairly certain it can be set in the preferences.
17:48  ronr_: or if it's a maven project, via the maven configuration.
17:49  RenatoSilva: vwegert: the project uses default workspace runtime, except if overriding. I guess you just changed default runtime right
17:50  danimoth: ronr_, if I could get eclipse on my dist, it will be good :)
17:50  RenatoSilva: danimoth: what dist
17:50  ronr_: danimoth: switch dist
17:50  RenatoSilva: archlinuxPPC?
17:50  ronr_: who uses PPC anymore?!
17:51 * RenatoSilva doesn't even know what's that
17:51  ronr_: PowerPC?
17:51  RenatoSilva: danimoth: have you tried the default linux 32-bit  build?
17:51  RenatoSilva: ronr_: ah ok
17:52  RenatoSilva: ronr_: didn't grok
17:52  ronr_: grok?
17:52  RenatoSilva: ronr_: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/grok
17:53  ronr_: danke
17:53  RenatoSilva: ronr_: I didn't see what PPC means at a glance
17:53  ronr_: seriously though, who uses PPC nowadays? :p
17:53  RenatoSilva: was it abandoned by the Macs?
17:54  RenatoSilva: danimoth: have you tried the default linux 32-bit  build?
17:54  vwegert: RenatoSilva: Negative. Workspace default, project compliance setting and PDE EE were all set to 1.5
17:55  RenatoSilva: vwegert: where were == before you fixed the problem?
17:55  ronr_: RenatoSilva: I doubt it'd work.
17:55  RenatoSilva: ronr_: well, go to download page, it doesn't mention distros, and architecture in not in the file name
17:55  vwegert: RenatoSilva: No change - they were already set to the same values
17:56  ronr_: RenatoSilva: doesn't mean anything though :)
17:56  RenatoSilva: vwegert: you have lost me
17:56  RenatoSilva: ronr_: I'd give it a try
17:56  ronr_: RenatoSilva: well, I'm not the one to try ;)
17:57  RenatoSilva: ronr_: does eclipse have native stuff in it?
17:57  vwegert: RenatoSilva: Workspace default 1.5, project compliance 1.5, PDE EE set to 1.5, but Eclipse still didn't complain about String.isEmpty(). I had to enable API analysis as described by jongw
17:57  ronr_: vwegert: is the JRE5 the checking installed JRE under the "Installed JREs" option in the preferences?
17:57  ronr_: checking = checked
17:57  ronr_: RenatoSilva: I imagine so.. swt.
17:58  ronr_: could be wrong.
17:58  RenatoSilva: ronr_: I think it's just JNI
17:59  ronr_: RenatoSilva: well, I don't care enough, and I'm not sure danimoth cares that much either :p
18:00  RenatoSilva: ronr_: :P
18:00  vwegert: ronr_: Yes
18:00  ronr_: vwegert: and under that, in the Execution Enviroment, when you pick J2SE-1.5, what do you see on the right side?
18:00  RenatoSilva: vwegert: API analysis? Sounds crazy, I'd read that entry again but I'm obsessed with /clearing the screen
18:01  RenatoSilva: vwegert: anyway you fixed it :)
18:01  Moopz: Hey. I'm trying to make my first Jar file, but whenever I try and export it as a Runnable Jar file, I get Resource out of sync. Why is this?
18:01  ronr_: because it's out of sync.
18:01  Moopz: ...
18:01  ronr_: no idea. just saying.
18:02  ronr_: try Project->Clean and then export again. maybe it'll work.
18:02  RenatoSilva: Moopz: what eclipse shows is out of sync with the filesystem
18:02  RenatoSilva: Moopz: just press F5 in the project folder

18:13  RenatoSilva: Moopz: fix the warnings, they are warnings
18:13 --- Channel #eclipse was synced in 124 seconds
18:13  RenatoSilva: Moopz: launch configuration is a configuration to launch something, like a Java pp
18:13  Moopz: Already did
18:13  RenatoSilva: Moopz: *app
18:14  trauler: hi
18:14  Moopz: Was merely an unused import though
18:14  RenatoSilva: Moopz: for creating a runnable jar, you need for some reason to select a launch configuration, it was implemented that way
18:14  trauler: "TERM environment variable not set."  - what is this?
18:15  RenatoSilva: Moopz: ok not so problematic  unused imports, but check your warnings. It's annoying to work on a projects with hundreds or thousands of warnings. It's professional if you make the problems view show nothing
18:16  RenatoSilva: trauler: that env var is not set
18:16  Moopz: True :)
18:16  trauler: AND WHAT?
18:16  trauler: how to set it    and what for is it?>
18:16  trauler: I do not use IT
18:17  RenatoSilva: trauler: not sure what's IT, AND WHAT == no idea, you didn't provide any context, what you are doing exactly, and what would you expect to be done exactly
18:17  RenatoSilva: Moopz: *on a project
18:18  trauler: Guys!   I startde small project and I do not use TERM flag
18:19  trauler: and there are no errors.... nowhere.  Just string in results   red string "TERM environment variable not set."
18:19 * RenatoSilva gives up
18:20  danimoth: there isn't howto on how build things from 0?
18:21  trauler: So... you do not know answer... ok   question 2
18:22  danimoth: trauler, it isn't related to your question, sorry
18:22  trauler: When I created new class..... I see 2 files  MyClass.cpp  and MyClass.h !!!  Why .h?  Why not .hpp  ?
18:22  danimoth: it was general thing: there is an eclipse-build-from-source howto?
18:23  trauler: I must rename is manualy?
18:24  RenatoSilva: danimoth: eclipse is mostly a Java app
18:24  RenatoSilva: danimoth: the architecture under which it runs is the JVM
18:24  trauler: CPP supported here too
18:24  trauler: Eclipse CDT
18:24  danimoth: but the binary which I get from eclipse.org/download is for linux x86 only
18:25  danimoth: no ppc version
18:25  RenatoSilva: danimoth: except if for some reason they put required native stuff there
18:25  RenatoSilva: danimoth: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR1/eclipse-jee-helios-SR1-linux-gtk.tar.gz
18:26  RenatoSilva: danimoth: it's not there in the link itself, how do you know it's a x86 only build?
18:27  danimoth: what is?
18:27  Moopz: How do I include images in my Jar file?
18:28  danimoth: the only thing I know is that I downloaded eclipse classic, and eclipse was a bin for x86
18:28  trauler: Where can I set TERM environment variable?
18:29  RenatoSilva: Moopz: that's a problem with the runnable jar I have passed too
18:29  RenatoSilva: Moopz: I don't recall how I fixed that :(
18:30  Moopz: I have included the folder it is in, as a source folder, but if I do that, then the path it needs to find it is fucked.
18:30  RenatoSilva: Moopz: I think with the regular JAR generation you can embed the required JARs
18:31  RenatoSilva: Moopz: the path used by the app? then change it. Or use the other option to embed the required jars
18:31  RenatoSilva: Moopz: do you need other jars at all? you said it was your first jar?
18:32  Moopz: It's my first jar I create. Never needed it before
18:32  RenatoSilva: danimoth: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#ubuntupowerpc

18:34  TobiasF: SUP BRO :@
18:34  danimoth: (3.6.x)
18:34  TobiasF: Whops.
18:34  TobiasF: Sorry.
18:36  RenatoSilva: danimoth: can you show me the link
18:36  danimoth: I lost it.. but was on the eclipse wiki
18:36  danimoth: I think I miss some deps
18:38  RenatoSilva: danimoth: go get it :P
18:40  trauler: Guys  ,   Why when I type several letters Eclipse do not give me list off all wards that I can write???
18:42  danimoth: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Eclipse_Build
18:42  danimoth: . Eclipse-build is verified to work on x86, x86_64 and ppc architectures
19:22  jongw: trauler: ctrl+space
19:29  trauler: when I compile project I see OLD version!  that work!  but I want to comiple NEW!   When I chenge something in main file then I see all errors... errors from all units.  But If I compile project fine thaen next comiletion do not show errors from units!  I think that when main file comiled fine (and was not chenged) then Eclipse do not recompile all project!
19:30  trauler: How to try to recomile project when I change not main file?
19:31  trauler: Now I put error in main file and run!  and after that I delete error from main file and then eclips show me all erorrs    in another files
19:42  haxmeister: hello I'm having difficulty getting eclipse install to function proper.. is anyone able to help?
19:45  rkrul: do you have a specific problem haxmeister?
19:47  haxmeister: yes
19:47  haxmeister: let me relaunch it
19:47  haxmeister: on the opening screen "welcome to eclipse" clicking on any of the icons causes the application to become unresponsive
19:50  rkrul: are there .log files in your eclipse directory?
19:50  rkrul: or eclipse/configuration
19:52  haxmeister: gosh I'm not even sure where to look
19:52  rkrul: your eclipse directory (where you unzipped it to) has a subfolder called "configuration"
19:53  rkrul: if something went wrong there might be a .log file where we can find out what it was
19:53  haxmeister: ok I didn't unzip.. I used my distros repository to pull it in
19:53  haxmeister: I'm digging now hang on
19:54  rkrul: /opt/eclipse/configuration probably
20:00  haxmeister: ok found configuration folder
20:01  haxmeister: only actual file there is config.ini
20:01  haxmeister: and 5 folders
20:05  danimoth: wow, I installed all dependencies of eclipse, now I could compile
20:05  danimoth: but I get: [javac] /home/danimoth/archlinuxppc/svn/eclipse/trunk/src/eclipse-build-0.6.1/build/eclipse-3.6.0-src/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.registry/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/adapter/AdapterFactoryProxy.java:14: package org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime does not exist
20:05  danimoth: I doesn't have eclipse, so how I could get org.eclipse.* ?
20:05  danimoth: don't
20:20  RenatoSilva: danimoth: I'd $grep -r 'org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime' eclipse
20:20  RenatoSilva: danimoth: then try to put the right match in the classpath
20:22  danimoth: I see for example
20:22  danimoth: ./build/eclipse-3.6.0-src/plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/runtime/Product.java
20:22  danimoth: I need to add to the classpath build/eclipse-3.6.0-src/plugins/
20:22  danimoth: ?
20:23  VladGh: can someone help me with the following error in egit plugin? An internal error occurred during: "Checking out refs/heads/master".   java.lang.NullPointerException
20:25  RenatoSilva: danimoth: I'm not sure on your specific issue, I'm just saying generically that if a class doesn't find a package, it's because it can't find it! Then I'd make it find it, adding the location to the classpath
20:25  danimoth: it's strange, this is a thing which must ant to take care of
20:25  danimoth: :/
20:26  RenatoSilva: danimoth: not sure but maybe ant expects a different dir structure, it seems you downloaded directly from repos, you didn't get a source release
20:27  danimoth: what a pain :/
20:27  RenatoSilva: danimoth: not sure if you're following the instructions you have exactly
20:27  danimoth: I downloaded this: 3.6.x_Helios/eclipse-3.6.0-src.tar.bz2"
20:27  danimoth: and eclipse-build-0.6.1.tar.bz2"
20:27  danimoth: then
20:27  RenatoSilva: danimoth: yeah man it's a pain, iirc I had a lot of trouble when trying to patch it
20:28  danimoth: tar xzvf eclipse-build-*.bz2
20:28  danimoth: then cd eclipse-build-..
20:28  danimoth: then cp ../eclipse-3.6.0-src.tar.bz2 .
20:28  RenatoSilva: is this described in a guide?
20:28  danimoth: then ant
20:28  danimoth: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Eclipse_Build
20:29  RenatoSilva: irc is relatively immediate, maybe you want to try the forums
