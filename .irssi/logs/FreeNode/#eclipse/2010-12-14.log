12:03  snoy_ms: ahhrg. Anyone knows how to set the achitecture to build? I need to build for I386. (C++)
12:04  snoy_ms: i get this warning -> xy file was built for i386 which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)
12:04  snoy_ms: or do i have to set this within the Linker ?
12:08  snoy_ms: Within xcode i can just change to I386, but i want to use Eclipse and not xcode
12:10  ronr_: hmm, never knew people actually use eclipse for C++.
12:12  snoy_ms: i just need to know where to say "eclipse, please use i386"...
12:12  ronr_: isn't there anything in the project properties?
12:14  ronr_: rcjsuen: when was the last time you used eclipse for C++ programming?
12:14  rcjsuen: Never.
12:14  rcjsuen: That's when.
12:14  ronr_: That's what I thought.
12:19  rcjsuen: Skyec: I think you should ask on the SWT ~forums tho personally I've never had this need
12:21  ronr_: rcjsuen: how do you see the channel history without being on? you look at an online log?
12:21  rcjsuen: yes
12:21  rcjsuen: http://echelog.matzon.dk/logs/browse/eclipse
12:23  ronr_: ok, scared me there a little.
12:23  nlg: While using the "Implement methods" in Helios: 20100917-0705
12:24  nlg: I cant seem to click "Next", while trying to generate implementations for my c++ methods
12:24  nlg: Is this a known bug or am I doing crazy things?
12:25  rcjsuen: check in ~bugzilla
12:25  nlg: rcjsuen: will do
12:26  ronr_: aah.. the broken tilda.
12:29  rcjsuen: nlg: Does your 'Next' button work in other wizards/dialogs?
12:30  nlg: rcjsuen: yes
12:31  nlg: Tested it in another project, that works.
12:31  nlg: I guess the stubs cant be generated because the project cant be built or something
12:32  nlg: or maybe it cant find the source file or whatever

13:25  rcjsuen: did you try putting your jar in eclipse/dropins/ directly?
13:52  csaba: I had to delete my ~/.eclipse directory, after that it worked fine
13:52  ronr_: okay, the egit plugin is going to kill me. I'm certain of it.
13:53  csaba: looks like the first time I copied my plugins into the dropins directory incorrectly, and after that, even though I've fixed it, it wouldn't want to acknowledge it
13:53  csaba: I've tried changing workspaces, doing eclipse -clean, deleting the directory from the dropins directory, it kept on saying the same error
13:54  csaba: then in the end I've deleted the .eclipse directory and then it worked fine, the plugin started to work...
14:09  mah01: It may sound stupid, but if we have our p2 repository on https, will Eclipse have any troubles with updating from it?
14:25  paulweb515: mah01: I don't believe so, but a little test should confirm it :-)
14:26  ronr_: it worked!!!
14:26  ronr_: it finally worked!!!
14:26  ronr_: WOOP!
14:39  ronr_: Aleph_One: got it to work!
14:39  Elephantman: hi :) I'm using Helios with kubuntu, and Compare seems not to work. I get a java.lang.NullPointerException error. Any clue on how to solve this ?
14:39  rcjsuen: check your log file
14:40  Elephantman: rcjsuen: where would I find that ?
14:40  rcjsuen: in your workspace
14:40  rcjsuen: or just open up your 'Error Log' view (if you have it)
14:44  Elephantman: rcjsuen: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/304723/
14:45  rcjsuen: see bugzilla
14:47  aaron11: Hi Im not seeing the blue arrows that you get in the outline view. I want to make Linear view the parent of a button (developing for Android) but the arrows are not therre
14:49  rcjsuen: Blue arrows?
14:49  aaron11: yeah
14:49  juank_prada: Hi guys, Im wondering if it is possible to migrate from NetBeans to Eclipse. The projects use a maven script, but migrating using the Maven plugin in Eclipse ends in a project with a weird folder/file structure. Also, the project is from a CVS repository
14:49  aaron11: im new to eclipse and more over android developing
14:50  aaron11: so please be uhh newbie-bearing :-)
14:50  aaron11: I see it on one guys video but im not seeing on my outline view
14:53  rcjsuen: aaron11: Maybe some screenshots will help explain what you are talking about.
14:53  rcjsuen: Though I don't do Android myself.
14:57  LabWorkey: "DLTK indexing in progress" has been running for 18 hours.
14:59  knighthawk: I'm trying to sync my environment with my co-workers. We're all on different OSes (Fedora, Ubuntu, Win7, XP, OSX) so we seem to be getting different default plugins. Anyone know which plugin offers Code Style? we're all running 3.6 but our Win7 guy didn't seem to get that option.
14:59  aaron11: rcjsuen, Uhh... I dont see any in google images
14:59  rcjsuen: aaron11: What do you mean?

15:15  heiko: i'm wondering how i could individually "disable" TableViewer rows visually (and practially) - greyed out and uneditable, or something. would appreciate pointers.
15:15 --- Channel #eclipse was synced in 122 seconds
15:18  Rayaken: heiko: ain't that a job for the label provider?
15:18  Rayaken: heiko: uneditable? are you using inline editing?
15:19  aaron11: rcjsuen, Ok I wuz out to dinner but heres mine http://imagebin.org/127868
15:20  heiko: Rayaken: i'll read up on label provider. i think i'm doing inline editing, but am not sure about that term. the data is edited straight in the fields of the table.
15:20  aaron11: rcjsuen, heres his http://imagebin.org/127869
15:20  Rayaken: heiko: http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/03/10/tip-styling-label-providers/
15:21  aaron11: rcjsuen, any idea at what those are
15:21  aaron11: I dont have any icon
15:21  rcjsuen: That doesn't seem like a problem with Eclipse itself.
15:22  rcjsuen: Feels like your application's structure doesn't match whatever the tutorial has. Perhaps some steps weren't outlined in full.
15:22  aaron11: rcjsuen, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-hNlTD1H0
15:22  heiko: Rayaken: thanks, will read and think
15:23  rcjsuen: I don't do Android development.
15:23  aaron11: dang! how do i make LinearView into a parent for buttonCount
16:09  RToto: hola, alguien? necesito ayuda con BIRT para eclipse
16:09  RToto: alguien lo ha usado por ac√°?
16:45  juank_prada: RToto, tal vez si preguntas en ingles obtengas alguna respuesta
16:45  RToto: ok, sorry my language
16:57  nitind: LabWorkey: DLTK isn't the entirety of Eclipse.  You might want to file a bug about that problem, or ask about it in a related forum.  ~forum
17:02  Mahi: Is there any plugin for eclipse to decompile the code???
17:03  rcjsuen: No results on Google?
17:04  Mahi: Didn't try there...
17:07  Aleph_One: Mahi: have a look at JD-Eclipse
17:08  Aleph_One: nice if you are debugging through some code
17:08  Mahi: yeah thanks....just found over there.....
17:08  Mahi: For that purpose I needed...
17:12  Mahi: Aleph one more query.......May I go for it?
17:12  nitind: Not like anyone can stop you.
17:12  xbb: after I build eclipse product welcome screen looks different on Linux, seems like style sheet is missing. On windows I get expected blue circles background. Any ideas why this happens? Screenshot: http://imgur.com/l4SV4.png
17:14  Mahi: Which freenode channel we can use for Java???I am new here
17:14  xbb: Mahi: ##java
17:14  Mahi: It's saying read documentation....and no members are there
17:15  Mahi: xbb: @ ##java
17:16  xbb: Mahi: /join ##java you need to register your nick though
17:16  Mahi: I don't know how to do that...Can you suggest please

17:23  gabriel9: hi all, i installed eclipse and set up some software sites. And i installed Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse. But there is no Java EE. I have also installed whole branch Web, XML, and Java EE Development. But no good.
17:23  gabriel9: any advice
17:24  nitind: gabriel9: Check with the OEP documentation and support.
17:29  nitind: gabriel9: Maybe you can elaborate on what "no Java EE" means?
17:29  gabriel9: no Java ee perspective
17:32 --- antiguru_ is now known as antiguru
17:38 --- antiguru is now known as test_antiguru
17:38 --- test_antiguru is now known as antiguru
17:57  gabriel9: i have checked whole documentation and do everything what they said.
17:57  gabriel9: no good
17:58  gabriel9: oh man this GNU/Linux is gone cost me my hair :/
17:59  rcjsuen: gabriel9: Where is your Eclipse installed
18:00  rcjsuen: Which Eclipse did you download, what is its name
18:01  gabriel9: Eclipse 3.6.1-1 http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/eclipse/
18:01  gabriel9: and i install it with package manager
18:01  rcjsuen: Did you try getting it from Eclipse.org?
18:03  gabriel9: nop
18:03  gabriel9: everything worked fine with all rest software
18:03  gabriel9: from my distro
18:05  rcjsuen: Do you see the installed plug-ins in the about dialog?
18:06 --- johnstorey is now known as johnstorey_afk
18:08  gabriel9: i'm so sorry. But i just realize that i run eclipse like user
18:08  mart: mmm... this helios compositeContent.jar - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/compositeContent.jar - it says <child location='http://download.eclipse.org/technology/epp/packages/helios/'/> .... shouldn't that point to the actual p2 repository at /technology/epp/packages/helios/SR1?
18:09  gabriel9: and it needs to install plugins in filesystem, but it can't and it install it in my home directory, but that is not good idea
18:09  mart: gabriel9: I've found by far the easiest way to work is just to download from download.eclipse.org.
18:10  gabriel9: yes, you are right. And there is always way to build my own package :)
18:10  mart: gabriel9: using the eclipse-distributed tar files seems much simpler to me.
18:11  mart: admittedly, the installation itself isn't as convenient.
18:12  gabriel9: no offense, but netbeans is far simplier
18:14  gabriel9: i shall try to make some packages for it, and if i have time i shall write wiki for my distro
18:14  gabriel9: for eclipse i mean, when i set it up. :)
18:16  VladGh: short question: In Eclipse Helios I have a remote project (through ssh) and I want to add a new project (from CVS) checked out into the existing remote project. But I get the following error: http://pastebin.com/dL4SDmp6. What am I doing wrong?
18:30  khekhe: evening
18:31  khekhe: there was another eclipse channel and i thought wow 1500 users until i realized it was some warez channel
18:31  khekhe: so i have a basic question anyone not idling?
18:31  rcjsuen: Just ask your question. If someone knows the answer they will respond. Simple as that.
18:32  khekhe: ok I have some android projects in a workspace
18:34  khekhe: they use different versions of the android.jar and when I debug one project it jumps to the source that is attached to the jar in the other project
18:34  khekhe: why could that be
18:37  khekhe: when i hit F3 on getScrollX() in one project that has an android.jar under "referenced libraries" eclipse jumps to the .class file in the android.jar of the other project.
18:38  khekhe: which is under "Android 2.2" not "Referenced libraries". i think it has something to do with global classpath settings?

21:52  myusuf3: i have a handler
21:52  myusuf3: that i need to enable or disable

22:56  ftc: is there a way to get the output of an expression while debugging java in eclipse similar to how you can just type 'p foo()' in gdb?
22:57  nitind: You might need to better explain what "p foo()" does.  If you're stepping, try selecting the expression and choose "Display" from the context menu,
22:58  dw87: nitind: it calls foo() and displays the output
22:58  tromey: in gdb, "p" is "print" and it accepts expressions in the current source language
