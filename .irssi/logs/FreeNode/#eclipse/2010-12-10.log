00:45  b2ag_: i have the same problem, described above, with indigo and tm 3.3
00:47  zanberdo: running eclipse helios on ubuntu 10.04 (I think I may have said 10.10 before but that was wrong).  I'm using java 1.5 and have downloaded the appropriate doc file from Oracle but I can't fathom how I'm to incorporate it into Eclipse. Can someone point me in the right direction. Mind you, what you get from Oracle is a zip file with many other folders and files, not a binary executable as most sites reference.
00:47 * zanberdo is new to Eclipse, so be gentle! :)
00:47  javahorn: nitind: you know any part listener example?
00:56  rcjsuen: zanberdo: That should be in the documentation if you want to attach your javadoc. Though I usually just use a JDK which includes the sources and that just gets taken care of.
00:57  rcjsuen: javahorn: What do you need an example for
00:57  zanberdo: I thought I had, but eclipse warns me that there are no javadocs installed. I'm looking into installing jdt (?) from inside Eclipse. not sure if that's the right approach... I just want/need the docs (of course)...
00:57  rcjsuen: if you can make java projects
00:57  rcjsuen: you alrdy have JDT
00:57  javahorn: rcjsuen: i am confused as Tab GUI comes with its own listening mechanism
00:58  javahorn: and donot know where to add for part listener
00:58  javahorn: i did not find any example
00:59  rcjsuen: if you add your own SWT TabFolder
00:59  zanberdo: I was reading about the jdt from the FAQ for the channel. I'm one of those who has jumped into the middle of this. Typically I use a different IDE, but as the contractor used Eclipse to develop, I want to continue to use it for my modifications.
00:59  rcjsuen: then use the SelectionListener
00:59  rcjsuen: yes the way the FAQ mentions is the JDK way
01:00  zanberdo: unfortunately there is no sun-java5-docs package for ubuntu 10.04 (nor a sun-java6-docs either).  And as I said, the ZIP file I got from Oracle is not a self-installing binary but all the files in a folder /doc
01:01  zanberdo: so, one last question: is this something I can install via the eclipse installer, or have I got to figure out how to manage it for my particular situation?
01:03  rcjsuen: No. You don't install JRE javadocs from within Eclipse.
01:04  javahorn: rcjsuen: http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/SWT-JFace-Eclipse/TabFolderExample.htm
01:04  javahorn: is good start?
01:05  javahorn: tabFolder.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {       public void widgetSelected(org.eclipse.swt.events.SelectionEvent event) {         System.out.println(tabFolder.getSelection()[0].getText() + " selected");       }
01:05  javahorn: at this place
01:05  zanberdo: ok, that answers that. Do I have to configure Eclipse to find the docs folder though? I would think it would be in the preferences, but....
01:05  javahorn: i should call , for color legend mechanism
01:05  rcjsuen: yes, you configure javadoc locations in your preferences, check the documentation
01:06  javahorn: rcjsuen: color legend is to appear in the view part(static)
01:12  zanberdo: okay, sorry to be so lame, but in the documentation I've found it starts by saying 'In Eclipse's package explorer right-click' but like some lame-ass noob, I have no idea where to find the package explorer in which to right-click!
01:12  zanberdo: btw, I do have a project open, so of course I have the project explorer...
01:12  rcjsuen: zanberdo: This is what you want http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-add_new_jre.htm
01:13  rcjsuen: except you "Edit" not "Add" I suppose
01:14  zanberdo: thanks rcjsuen I will check that out now
01:14  rcjsuen: javahorn: yes, you want to update your legend based on which view has been selected (or which tab, whatever you're doing)
01:14  rcjsuen: zanberdo: the one you found is if you had some 3rd-party jar and you wanted to put the javadoc for the jar
01:15  zanberdo: got it. I've seen this screen before, but didn't know what to do from here. the doc you've linked to looks like it might help. thanks again.
01:16 --- discodan_ is now known as discodan
01:16  javahorn: rcjsuen: thanks . makes sense now. so selectionlistener and part listener, i am rendering color legend in view part, of the two , which way the differ or why one is more suited?
01:20  zanberdo: hmm... still stumped. when I edit the existing JRE in an attempt to add the folder with the javadoc files the only option I have is add external jar - and the interface wants me to supply each and every jar file (I presume)... I hate being a noob

01:35  rcjsuen: zanberdo: what do you mean, that dialog has other buttons
01:37  zanberdo: all greyed out. but that's ok, I found where in the project I can set the path to the javadocs, so I think I'm good to go. It just appears that there are some objects this contractor has used that either aren't apart of the standard java compliment (i.e. not in javadocs) or the docs I have don't include help for them.  However, the bulk of the code now does have docs, so that's a start
01:38  rcjsuen: zanberdo: they're greyed as-is because it's dependent on selection
01:38  rcjsuen: if you select something in the tree the button's enablement state updates as applicable
01:40  zanberdo: I see what you mean. I have to select each of the JRE system libs then specify the javadoc location. ok.
01:41  rcjsuen: i guess you're good-to-go anyway
01:41  zanberdo: I think in this case, the javadoc path for the project might suffice, but I can already see one limitation to that approach: only one path provided per project. with the JRE def I can specify for each JRE defined.

03:09  rcjsuen: No.
03:30  Tniffoc: rcjsuen, not even a way to register it with the system in a plugin?
03:31  rcjsuen: Not sure myslef.

07:07  Thomas`-: Hey guys-  Wondering if someone could help me out with a problem -  recentley my Eclipse Helios froze and forced me to end process through task manager.  When I try to run it, it seems to freeze on the splash at "Loading Workbench...".  Would anyone be able to help with this?
07:14  Thomas`-: The Problem Event Name Is: "AppHangB1"
07:17  Thomas`-: My guess is the workbench file got corrupted as I just made a new one and it loads fine.  So question should perhaps be How could a repair an Eclipse Workbench
07:24  Thomas`-: Figured it out finally.. please disregard

10:57  topriddy: hello
10:57 --- discodan_ is now known as discodan
10:59  topriddy: got a question as regards creating global libraries/pointers in eclipse...under netbeans i can group several jars together and then give it a name(library) which i can easily then add to each project I work with. Plus i dont understand why I have to add libraries/jars to web-inf folder in eclipse and also again to the java build path. Under netbeans i do this just in ONE place.
