00:01  gartral: can anyone point me to a precompiled version of eclipse for x86 linux? my package manager is completly borked
00:08  aeurielesn: ~tell gartral about linux-install
00:08  Arbalest: gartral: Trying to install Eclipse on Linux? http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#How_do_I_install_Eclipse_on_Linux.3F
00:09  aeurielesn: gartral: uhm, that guide is pretty old, just go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and grab it
00:17  gartral: aeurielesn: is it precompiled?
00:17 * gartral hates his dialup-speed "3g"
00:18  aeurielesn: gartral: yup. just download, untar and run
00:19  gartral: dumb-question: what's helios?
00:21  aeurielesn: gartral: the codename for the 3.6.x version
00:27  fabio: hello, anyone knows how to completely remove eclipse from my ubuntu
00:27  fabio: ?
00:30  rcjsuen: I think that would probably depend on how you installed it.
00:30  gartral: fabio: how was it installed?
00:31  gartral: fabio: if you installed it with apt, or another package manager, open a terminal and run: sudo apt-get purge eclipse
00:31  gartral: fabio: if you downloaded it from the website: delete the folder you extracted it too
00:32  gartral: aeurielesn: really? then why is it you have both 3.6.1 and Helios in the topic? ;p
00:33  aeurielesn: rcjsuen: ^
00:33  aeurielesn: actually, i dunno :)
00:35  rcjsuen: I suppose for completeness's sake.
00:35  rcjsuen: Helios is just the name of the simultaneous release. Not every project participating is at 3.6.1.
00:35  gartral: rcjsuen: 'nother dumb one: what's the difference?
00:35  gartral: o
00:41  rcjsuen: cdt for example
00:41  rcjsuen: is at 7.0.1 now i think
00:41  rcjsuen: and some is like 0.x.y
00:55  RenatoSilva: is it possible to download jface separately?
00:56  gartral: my peak bandwidth is 73.3 kb/s >.<

01:45  raveon: if I have this build script generated by Eclipse at http://pastey.net/142009 how do i run it from the command line to generate the .jar?
01:45  raveon: i need to setup an automatic checkout/build
02:21  raveon: how come the eclipse Ant build file doesn't create a target for jar?
02:25  gartral: CRAP
02:26  gartral: why the hell dont your mirrors support resuming a paused download?!?!
02:26  gartral: now i have to wait another 2 freaking hours to start coding >.<
02:47  gartral: well?
02:48  FauxFaux: Uh, all the mirrors support download resuming.
03:04  paulweb515_: raveon: you would run it with eclipse -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -buildfile /path/to/your/ant.xml
03:05  paulweb515_: rcjsuen: you could "mirror" jface out of the repo, if you don't want to download the platform runtime (the smallest zip that has jface in it)
03:06  rcjsuen: Well I suppose it's technically feasible.
04:31  gartral: no.. you mirrors do not support resuming interupted downloads. this is twice my connection has failed and twice ive had to restart a 3 hour long wait.
04:36  gartral: i keep getting "resume failed".. so
04:59  gartral: eclipse won't open. it just dies. no error

05:11  gartral: how do i tell eclipse to use a different JVM? the one i think it's trying to use is busted
05:12  gartral:  A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:

05:23  NoobFukaire: set JAVA_HOME
05:23  gartral: NoobFukaire: ... how?
05:23  NoobFukaire: set JAVA_HOME
05:24  gartral: where, how... i'm a complete noob with eclipse
05:24  NoobFukaire: gartral: http://tinyurl.com/36mn2wy
05:24  NoobFukaire: this is a linux user thing, not really java or eclipse related at all
05:24  NoobFukaire: ah I totally screwed that up
05:25  gartral: NoobFukaire: not tinylink me, my firewalls are set to block direct forwarding
05:26  NoobFukaire: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=set+JAVA_HOME+linux
05:26  gartral: lmgtfy is a direct link, my firewalls are blocking that
05:26  NoobFukaire: alright well, you get the idea right
05:27  gartral: isn't
05:30  gartral: NoobFukaire: my PATH is set to a locked state, i can't edit it. is there a setting IN the eclipse files i can edit to change it so that eclipse uses the sun-java-6.0 in my /home?
05:30  NoobFukaire: PATH is a different env variable
05:30  NoobFukaire: with eclipse I believe you can specify a vm as well
05:30  NoobFukaire: but I haven't done it
05:31  gartral: x.x
05:35  Flaw:  specify a vm as well
05:35  Flaw: 06:30 < NoobFukaire> but I haven't done it
05:35  Flaw: 06:31 < gartral> x.x
05:35  Flaw: fak
05:36  Flaw: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM
05:36  Flaw: was what I meant to paste
05:44  gartral: Flaw: thank you!
