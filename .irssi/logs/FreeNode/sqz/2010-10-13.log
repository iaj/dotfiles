15:02 sqz: doing fine man, actually..too fne
15:02 sqz: should get some work done :)
15:04 sqz: how are you?
15:05 iaj: im fine thanks
15:05 iaj: :-)
15:05 iaj: I've got a question since you are the PHP man.... heh... I want to write a php script which exports a mysql query to a  file, like CSV or HTML..
15:06 iaj: is that possible, or rather - do you have any knowledge in that area?
15:07 sqz: with exporting you mean 'displaying the output of an executed sql query result' ?
15:08 iaj: hmm yeah... like getting the fields into a file... like select name,forename,lastname,ortofliving
15:08 iaj: and then that would make a csv file..... with name forename lastname ortofliving into a csv/html file
15:09 sqz: you mean just the fields (columnnames) or the values of all the records in that table
15:09 iaj: first row the columnnaes, and then all the records that fulfill the where clause.
15:09 iaj: columnnames , sorry
15:09 sqz: http://hu.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-db-query.php
15:10 iaj: yeah.. I got the query working already :)
15:10 iaj: The problem is the 'exporting'
15:15 sqz: try this: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/tpl.class.phps
15:15 sqz: with this simple template class, you can build up a html in simple way which gives you overview
15:15 sqz: it will help to keep you html & php seperated
15:16 sqz: the 'M' and 'V' (from MVC) in this case
15:16 sqz: basically it just lets you use textfiles in which keywords like %myvar% are replaced with values in php
15:18 iaj: hmmm... woa... I don't get it so far... 
15:18 iaj: php and html seperated?
15:18 sqz: just look at the example in the codeheader
15:19 sqz: that will explain much more better :)
15:20 iaj: hmmm... alright. so I can create a html file with that one?
15:20 iaj: eg. its output is a html file
15:20 iaj: or I can get me a html
15:21 sqz: well basically you could use the .tpl files not only for html, you could also generate xml or text etc
15:21 sqz: the tpl files are just 'template' files in where you can place variables (which are replaced with whatever values you want in php, by using 'assign')
15:22 sqz: for generating html, xml its the best method
15:22 iaj: ahhhhhhhhh
15:22 sqz: for generating a csv, you could also try http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php
15:22 iaj: Oh... yeah I get it now.. but.. .hmmm.
15:22 iaj: What if the number of markers to be replaced
15:22 iaj: is not a fixed number
15:22 sqz: markers?
15:22 iaj: Now I get it.. using a tmpl file and replace its %MARKERS%
15:23 sqz: yes
15:23 iaj: the %stuff%... variables
15:23 iaj: you call it
15:23 iaj: sorry im used to typo3
15:23 iaj: called Markers there
15:23 sqz: aah :)
15:23 sqz: template engines (and the one in typo3) are just bascically 'search-replace' engines of textfiles
15:24 iaj: Hmm, yeah.. its actually a quite nice system
15:24 iaj: imho
15:24 iaj: if just I were the one who invented FaceBook
15:24 iaj: :p
15:24 sqz: hehe
15:24 sqz: hmmm gotta go man
15:24 sqz: bbl
15:25 iaj: heh,np !
15:25 iaj: thanks man!
15:26 iaj: tty later
