13:50 iaj: You still up?
13:53 sqz: yes
13:53 sqz: (but not always since I'm at work also)
13:53 sqz: :)
13:53 iaj: when I open up files with vim *
13:53 iaj: I can go through the list with :n
13:53 iaj: but how can I close one and go to the next?
13:54 iaj: if it shouldn't appear in the bufferlist
13:54 sqz: thats really a #vim question, I don't use the bufferlist anymore
13:54 sqz: I use :ntab :sp (filename) :vsp (filename)
13:55 sqz: and NERDTree (its a filemanager which sits on your leftside of the screen
13:55 sqz: from there I just open and close files
13:55 iaj: ntab?! :D~
13:55 sqz: (like eclipse/zend etc)
13:56 sqz: :tabn
13:57 iaj: Ohhh
13:57 iaj: you use tabs?
13:57 iaj: Screw you :)
13:57 iaj: You happen to use the Manpageview plugin?
13:59 sqz: hehe
13:59 sqz: hmmm not really
14:00 sqz: hehe yeah I guess some ppl don't like the tab-feature
14:01 sqz: well..its just a feature nothing more :)
14:01 iaj: ;-)
14:01 iaj: yeah.... I was strongly adviced to only stick to buffers :-)
14:02 sqz: yeah well I must say its not bad to follow advices from peeps in #vim
14:02 sqz: there are really skillfull vimmers in there
14:05 iaj: i'd like to see a screencast of a real pro in vim
14:05 sqz: same here!
14:05 sqz: funny you say that
14:06 sqz: I'm busy building a site for that purpose: www.playterm.org
14:06 sqz: because from some perspective it does not make sense IRC'ing/talking about vim/cmdline stuff
14:06 sqz: its far more better to actually see it
14:08 iaj: yeah nice.. I'm gonna throw a look at that one soon
14:08 iaj: I really would like to see some pro in action :)
