13:30 --- Query: Starting query with sqz on FreeNode
13:30 iaj: lo there
13:30 iaj: can I ask you a little question
13:30 iaj: :-D
13:31 sqz: ofcoarse! :)
13:34 iaj: You just said you are doing php in VIM right?
13:34 sqz: yes a lot
13:34 iaj: how do you test your php stuff?
13:35 sqz: well thats an interesting topic
13:36 sqz: I tried 'PHPUNIT'-style (code), and I tried 'Selenium' (browserside)
13:36 sqz: and all of them were a pain in the ass, it still did not prevent me from getting calls like 'hey its not working now!'
13:37 sqz: sow basically, then I started what I'm using now: custom errorhandling and custom assertions
13:37 sqz: so..whenever an error is triggered, or an assertion fails, it sends an email to me
13:38 sqz: assertions like: if( _assert( is_object($foo), "object foo is not an object! maybe permissinproblem?") ){   }
13:38 sqz: so then I already get the solution in my mailbox, and I fix it before the client notices
13:38 sqz: that is how I do it nowadays, and it pays off better then putting time into PHPunit or Selenium (for me)
13:39 sqz: and how about you?
13:44 sqz: (btw. since I code with assertions, already I rarely have 'voodoo' bugs, since I already killed it while developing)
13:44 iaj: hmmm, I'm just getting started with php
13:44 iaj: sec phone
13:45 sqz: ok
13:46 sqz: first computer language experience?

13:59 iaj: Nah not really I was doing some java/c/qbasic already.. haha... but its been a while
13:59 iaj: I need to code in java for college - but I think VIM is not very suited for hat
13:59 iaj: that*
13:59 iaj: unfortunaltely

14:05 sqz: iaj: no unless you customize it
14:05 sqz: but that takes a bit of time to get into also, so I agree
14:05 sqz: I code actionscript,flex,c,c++,haxe & php with vim
14:06 iaj: hm yeah it's quite a challenge actually
14:06 iaj: But I'm giving it a shot
14:06 iaj: just for getting more into vimming
14:06 iaj: don't wanna learn x different IDEs
14:06 sqz: in my .vimrc configuration file, I put a line which searches for a local .vimrc (in my projectdir)
14:07 iaj: can you share your vimrc?
14:07 sqz: and in the .vimrc in my projectdir, I bind keys like F1 to 'javac Main.java' etc :)
14:07 sqz: ofcoarse
14:07 sqz: but first I gotta eat my bacon&eggs, (Just made an egg) hehe
14:07 sqz: bbl
14:12 sqz: are you on linux or win?
14:15 iaj: yeah sure
14:15 iaj: Im at work currently
14:15 iaj: sorry not that much time :-) heh
14:15 iaj: Im on NEITHER linux
14:15 iaj: nor win
14:15 iaj: OSX!! :-D
14:15 sqz: aah ok :)

14:24 sqz: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/vim-custom-ide-per-project.zip
14:25 sqz: I made a small example for you: vimrc <- this is the main configuration file (you can merge it with yours)
14:26 sqz: if you go into the directory 'myproject' and run vim..then it will also read .vimrc in the local directory
14:26 sqz: so..then if you press F1, you see all the mappings (which you can edit in (local).vimrc )
14:26 sqz: by doing so, for every c/c++/java/flex/actionscript/php-project you can have an unique streamlined custom IDE
14:27 sqz: for me it works really great, I automated all the stuff which I normally would do in the console xxxx times :)

16:08 iaj: Oh that looks pretty interesting
16:08 iaj: actually yeah.. amazing
16:08 iaj: but
16:08 iaj: couldn't you do all those bindings with autocommands as well?
16:08 iaj: eg filetype depending?

16:24 sqz: ofcoarse! basically what you've just said made me stay with vim forever
16:25 sqz: I've had many IDE's, all with very dependent project configuration files
16:25 sqz: but with vim I can customize stuff however I want, and can use it in every project
16:26 sqz: learning vim really pays off for every project, its just like linux, its not trendrelated like many newskool IDE-editors
16:30 iaj: Hmmm yeah
16:30 iaj: theres a VI plugin for netbeans and ecilpse
16:31 iaj: but both aren't really the same as vim
16:31 sqz: ah ok, netbeans and eclipse are cool..used to use them (also Zend Studio)
16:31 iaj: Hmmm... can I do java coding efficiently in VIM?
16:31 iaj: Not really right?
16:31 sqz: but at somepoint I could not accept the fact that an texteditor was so CPU-heavy.
16:32 iaj: Because no way for debugging etc, as I'd have in an IDE
16:32 sqz: what do you mean with efficiently coding?
16:33 sqz: well the whole idea with vim is that you install plugins, so you start with a minimal editor, and you carefully choose what to install
16:33 sqz: you first go to www.vim.org, and pick your plugins
16:33 iaj: well the same efficienty as I'd have in netbeans / eclipise
16:33 iaj: eclipse*
16:33 iaj: yeah.. I know.. well
16:33 sqz: here I see: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1213
16:33 sqz: really don't know what that is
16:34 sqz: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Java   <- javacoders tips for vim
16:34 iaj: hmmm well I always heard that java is not a language you could code in VIM pretty well
16:35 sqz: hmmm I think you can code every language with vim very well, its just that there are a lot of people out there who think vim is very minimalistic
16:35 sqz: (because they just downloaded it and did not install any plugins)
16:35 iaj: Yeah, ofc.. you could pimp it with plugins
16:35 iaj: but would you reach ALL the functions that you got with an IDE
16:35 iaj: like debugging and stuff
16:35 iaj: breakpoints
16:36 sqz: ofcoarse! let me explain you..
16:36 sqz: they say "eclipse is wonderfull for debugging flash, vim doesn't have this"
16:37 sqz: well thats bullshit, because every SDK (like JDK) comes with a debugger tool..mostly a binary called 'jdb' or something
16:37 sqz: for flash its called 'fdb', you can call it in your terminal window (eclipse does this in the background)
16:38 sqz: inside this debugger program, you can set breakpoints whatever you want, and for every debugger is a vimplugin available (almost)
16:39 sqz: but ofcoarse if you want the 'all-in-one' package, then eclipse is a good choice
16:39 sqz: however if you want for speed and ergonomy (use only what you need) you should go for vim
16:40 sqz: yeah..'jdb' thats it..thats the java debugger which eclipse uses on the background : http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jdb.html
16:40 sqz: when I code programs, and need a debugger, I just run it in the console
16:41 sqz: but ofcoarse, you must use your own way of doing things..if console stuff is a bit too uncomfortable then forget what I said
16:41 iaj: hmmm thanks... 
16:41 iaj: nah I love the console
16:41 iaj: its amazing
16:41 iaj: I want to completely.. well ... live there
16:42 sqz: hehe same here :)
16:43 sqz: cool thing with vim on OSX/linux is that you can automate everything, for example releasing sourcecode & documentation
16:43 iaj: hmm, how do you mean?
16:43 iaj: or rather what do you mean
16:43 sqz: for some projects, when I press F3 in vim..it compiles the documentation, strips out the comments, compresses the sources, and puts it into one zip
16:44 iaj: really? can you pastebin the command in there?
16:44 sqz: ..well just do something like this :
16:44 sqz: (in your local .vimrc)
16:46 sqz: noremap <F3> :!sed -e (regex) && doxygen yourproject doc && zip -r release.zip doc src
16:46 sqz: (you need to work out the console cmd's first seperately on the console, tocheck if they work)
16:46 sqz: but thats basically the idea of automating multiple commands by one keystroke..or..you could write your own shellscript and call it
16:46 iaj: heh
16:47 iaj: alright.. yeah... that's pretty nice actually :-)
16:47 sqz: noremap <F3> :!yourshellscript
16:47 iaj: Yeah.. heh... can you pastebin a file for your python editing for example?
16:48 sqz: hmmm I dont edit python or have any bindings for it
16:48 sqz: however I could give you my .vimrc (its big, don't be afraid)
16:48 iaj: heh
16:48 iaj: yeah would be cool :-)
16:48 iaj: I love exploring those
16:49 sqz: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/vimrc
16:49 sqz: in this version, I can switch thru seveveral keyboard mappings by pressing ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8
16:50 iaj: Woah.. that seems nice :D
16:50 sqz: also in this case, when I press ,6 (then I select loading the local .vimrc)
16:50 iaj: why don't u use that VCS plugin?
16:50 sqz: VCS?
16:51 iaj: Theres a plugin for all the svn stuff
16:51 iaj: Iirc... lotsa ppl use it
16:52 sqz: well I use svn mostly on the commandline, since I need to be carefull when commiting stuff
16:53 sqz: also I make use of svn hooks (so if I commit to the repos, it will also ftp it to a site etc)
16:53 sqz: you have an url?
16:54 iaj: sec
16:54 iaj: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90
16:54 iaj: this one
16:54 iaj: I think ONCE one knows how to use svn and stuff
16:54 iaj: its just fine :D
16:57 iaj: My goal tonight consists of making me a java-friendly VIM :-D
16:59 sqz: if I were you I should combine tips from the following url with your own efforts so far: http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=13751
17:00 sqz: I think once you have pimped your .vimrc file to your needings, you are able to pimp vim for whatever project
17:03 sqz: (btw. be sure to always backup your .vimrc, this one will stay with you for the rest of your life!) :P
17:05 iaj: yeah... how do you make those backups?
17:06 sqz: just send yourself an email with .vimrc as attachement :)
17:07 iaj: lol that's weird :D
17:07 iaj: I should just github it ;)
17:08 sqz: hehehe...hmmm this vcscommand is nice..but I use exactly the same stuff already
17:08 iaj: btw is there any way to coloirze an echo?
17:08 iaj: in php?
17:08 iaj: Yeah :-)
17:08 sqz: iaj ls -la
17:08 sqz: sorry :)
17:08 iaj: :-D
17:08 iaj: ls -la !
17:08 iaj: la !
17:09 sqz: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/sutra.color.php <- colors 
17:09 sqz: hehe
17:09 sqz: also are you familiar with running console cmds within vim?
17:10 sqz: like :!date  or :!tree or :!ls or :!svn stat ?
17:10 sqz: its really great running external commands like that, then you don't need a extra terminal, keep things very compact
17:11 iaj: hm yeah kind of... where are the messages directed to?
17:11 iaj: :messages?
17:11 iaj: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/sutra.color.php
17:11 iaj: nothing popping up mate :D
17:12 sqz: no you immediately see the output in your console..but if you do !!ls then the output gets inserted as text
17:12 sqz: ah wait
17:12 sqz: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/sutra.color.phps
17:12 sqz: apache wanted to execute it :)
17:14 iaj: hmmm and how do I use it?
17:15 iaj: thanks so far :-)
17:15 iaj: when combined with echo or something...
17:15 iaj: I need to source that php file in my other php file first
17:15 iaj: I guess and then can make use of those functions?
17:17 sqz: yes, if its in the same dir do : <? include_once( dirname(__FILE__)."/sutra.color.php" ); $c = new Console_Color(); ?>
17:18 sqz: and then print colored stuff like <? echo $c->convert("%YI'm yello!%nI'm normal again"); ?>
17:19 sqz: anyways, you are welcome, lot of other people helped me so I help you
17:19 sqz: at your service!@
17:19 iaj: hmm if its within the <?php I can drop the <? part
17:19 iaj: right?
17:19 iaj: yeah tahnks a lot :)
17:19 iaj: I'll surely do that
17:19 iaj: are you online a lot?
17:20 sqz: well almost everyday I use vim on my server, and I run my irclient on this server
17:20 sqz: so yes..
17:20 iaj: I don't get any colors :(
17:21 iaj: include_once( dirname(__FILE__)."/sutra.color.php" ); $c = new Console_Color();
17:21 iaj: got that right after my <?php
17:21 iaj: echo $c->convert("%YI'm yello!%nI'm normal again");
17:21 iaj: print $c;
17:21 iaj: and that ..but the echo should already print it.. doesn't it?
17:21 sqz: the echo should print it
17:21 sqz: are you testing in the console?
17:21 iaj: well its a .php script
17:22 iaj: and I run it from the console
17:22 iaj: yea
17:22 iaj: the iTerm
17:22 iaj: in my case
17:22 sqz: do you see any output at all?
17:22 iaj: not from that one.. no :\
17:23 sqz: thats strange.. and if you do a normal echo? like echo "hello!"; ?
17:23 iaj: thats working
17:23 iaj: just not the convert stuff:\
17:23 iaj: but no error message as well
17:23 iaj: sec ill pastebin
17:23 sqz: ok
17:24 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/274018
17:24 iaj: ignore the lower functions
17:25 sqz: ah wait..
17:25 sqz: delete the $c = new Console_Color
17:26 sqz: and the echo $c->convert
17:27 iaj: huh?
17:27 sqz: try running: echo Console_Color::convert("%C test test %n");
17:27 iaj: delete?
17:27 sqz: just delete every line I told you, except the include
17:27 sqz: then run the above command
17:28 iaj: Yeah that one is working :-)
17:28 iaj: thanks
17:28 iaj: wheres that sutra.color from?
17:29 sqz: some console app I made, but its ripped from phpclasses.org I thnk
17:30 iaj: echo "[ ✔ ] Die e-Mail Adresse " . Console_Color::convert(%G $line %n) . " wurde erfolgreich aus galal!aprica_000096/vid_kunde abgemeldet." . "\n";
17:30 iaj: what's wrong about that one ?
17:30 iaj: if $line is a string 
17:30 iaj: oh
17:30 iaj: "%G " $line "%n" 
17:34 iaj: Yeah its working :-)
17:34 iaj: awesome
17:34 iaj: heh
