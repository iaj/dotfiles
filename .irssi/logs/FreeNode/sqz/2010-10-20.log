11:43 sqz: Hey man
11:43 sqz: yes sure, how are you mate
11:43 iaj: im fine thanks - what about you?
11:43 iaj: :-)
11:43 iaj: Had a question about php but unfort. I solved it already
11:44 iaj: OH.. sec.. . wait...
11:47 iaj: How do you manage, that, with those startup registers for PHP files?
11:48 sqz: I'm great man
11:49 sqz: http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/php_registers.vim
11:50 sqz: you can source it manually by typeing :source php_registers.vim (or paste it into your vimrc)
11:50 sqz: with @p you execute register p
11:51 sqz: (which does the vardump(print)) thing)
11:52 iaj: hmmm that won't work becuase when itg ets pasted the ^D stuff gets disordered I think :(
11:52 iaj: let @l = "i\";klK4:s/\"//g
11:52 iaj: K4:s/;//g
11:52 iaj: i_log( \"\\krK4yK4a \" . pK4a );^kd"
11:52 iaj: shouldn't look like that right :( ? can you mb zip it and upload it?
11:53 sqz: cant you just type 'wget http://kn0r.dev.mannetje.org/temp/php_registers.vim' in your terminal?
11:53 iaj: sec
11:54 iaj: hmmm it ain't working that way as well
11:54 iaj: let @a = "i_assert( ,"")[D[D[D[D[D";
11:54 iaj: that isn't in your mappings I thnk
11:54 iaj: think
11:56 sqz: ?
11:56 sqz: did you do the wget thingie?
11:56 sqz: there are special charachters in the php_register.vim file which prevent copy/pasting by mouseselection..
11:56 iaj: yep
11:56 iaj: I did it via wget
11:57 sqz: therefore in vim to test it..you should do :source php_register.vim
11:57 sqz: and then do @p to test it
11:58 sqz: it should work if you start vim in the directory where this file is located
11:59 sqz: and if you want to add it to your vimrc, just do :!!/path/to/php_register.vim
12:02 sqz: but if it does not work forget it..
12:02 sqz: then can also do it like this:
12:03 sqz: set your cursor on a var..hit ESC..then hit qa (you will see 'recording' at the bottom of the screen)
12:04 sqz: then do all kinds of stuff ..insert characters...move cursor...and when you are finished..hit ESC and then q
12:04 sqz: (then you have recorded a 'movie' into a register 'a')
12:04 sqz: so next time when your cursor is on a variable..just hit @a and it will perform exactly the same actions
12:06 sqz: so in short: ESC q a (dostuff) q       <---- records into 'a'
12:06 sqz: so in short: ESC q a (dostuff) ESC q      <---- records into 'a'   (correction)
12:07 sqz: @q                                  <---- performs recoring 'a'
12:07 sqz: @a                                  <---- performs recording 'a' (correction)
12:07 sqz: hmmm have to drink more coffee
12:07 sqz: :)

12:13 iaj: what is the !! pattern?
12:13 iaj: I never herad of it
12:13 iaj: heard*
12:14 sqz: well if you are entering text and you hit ESC!!ls  it will 'paste' the output of the command ls in your document
12:14 sqz: :!!ls does the same
12:14 iaj: oooh.. now I see. :)
12:14 sqz: so you can also do :!!cat /etc/passwd  to 'paste' a file in your document
12:17 iaj: I sourced the file.. and now if I hit @t for example what SHOULD happen?
12:17 sqz: @p
12:17 sqz: just try it
12:18 iaj: _popup( "\" ) " . \" )  " );
12:18 iaj: is printed on my current line
12:18 sqz: yes..well thats function I use a lot in my framewrk
12:18 iaj: is var_dump supposed to create D D D D lines above?
12:19 iaj: D
12:19 iaj: D
12:19 iaj: D
12:19 iaj: D
12:19 iaj: die( var_dump(   ) ); ) )$fkalsdjlk
12:19 iaj: is the output of @t
12:19 sqz: hmm..could you please stop pasting special characters? :)
12:19 iaj: on a line containing $fkalsdjkl
12:19 sqz: my screen is flashing an beeping all the time :)
12:19 iaj: lol :D... oh
12:19 iaj: that's for terminal specific?
12:20 sqz: ow wait
12:20 sqz: same here..mostly I use @t if I wanted to write die( var_dump( ) );
12:20 sqz: so..when I want to output a variable, then I hit @t and type the variable
12:21 sqz: it works very fast because ou can immediately start typing the variable within the ( )
12:21 sqz: I have other registers for actionscript who work more sophisticated on vars etc
12:22 sqz: but the bottomline is..you can record stuff into these registers yourself (I explained you above)
12:22 sqz: q
12:22 sqz: hmmm gotta go back to work
12:22 sqz: bbl
12:25 iaj: woah
12:25 iaj: ok
12:25 iaj: working like a charm in terminal
12:25 iaj: its just those terminal sequences that drive my macvim crazy
12:25 iaj: hahah
