00:39  rphillips: i have added support for vcsinfo to my `oh-my-zsh` fork. just a fyi.
00:39  rphillips: http://github.com/rphillips/oh-my-zsh
00:40  rphillips: legacy 'git' plugin support should be intact, but the plugin should be disabled within ~/.zshrc
00:48  anon33_: I don't really understand what the following function does - http://pastie.org/1234001 
00:48  anon33_: Would anyone mind helping explain it to me?
01:01  teratorn: anon33_: it lets you type "cd ..." or "cd ...." etc
01:03  anon33_: ah, okay - i was getting confused at the x$* - i'm guessing that's a reference to $1?
01:05  teratorn: anon33_: it expands to the set of all positional parameters, like $@
01:05  anon33_: thanks :)
01:06  teratorn: anon33_: it's odd how it's written... and I have a better solution for this problem, also
01:08  teratorn: anon33_: http://fpaste.org/sxVZ/
01:11  teratorn: anon33_: btw the "x" in that code is just that, the literal string "x", used as an ordinal value... but I don't really think it's necessary, "[[ $@ == ... ]]" would work just as well
01:11  teratorn: s/ordinal/sentinal/

04:11  sir_lewk: is there any reason that `vim` and ``which vim`` would two seperate binaries?
04:12  sir_lewk: the first runs /usr/bin/vim (incorrect) and the second runs ~/bin/vim (correct)
04:12  sir_lewk: the first entry in my PATH is ~/bin
04:13  sir_lewk: *would run two...
04:16  thrig: sir_lewk: when was PATH set? Before or after restarting each shell?
04:18  sir_lewk: before I guess, I've opened up new xterms several times after my path export in my ~/.zshrc
04:18  sir_lewk: in my zshrc: export PATH="~/bin/:$PATH:$TIGCC/bin"
04:19  thrig: what happens if you replace ~/ with $HOME/ ?
04:19  sir_lewk: ah, that seems to do it
04:20  sir_lewk: interesting

12:13  iaj: hmm, is there something wrong about that syntax?     printf ${red} "$line";
12:14  iaj: if local red= is defined above?
12:15  Mikachu: what do you want to do?
12:15  Mikachu: much syntax is valid but makes no sense at all :)
12:38  nimred: are there any syntax error in this :
12:38  nimred: if [[ ${BAT_PERC} -lt 10 ]] || [[ ${BAT_PERC} -eq 10 ]] ; then
12:38  nimred: where
12:38  nimred: BAT_PERC=`acpi -b|awk '{print $4}'|sed -e s/%,//`
12:54  Mikachu: nimred: if you have a problem, just say what the problem is
12:55  nimred: /home/nimred/scripts/run-dzen2: line 168: [[: 100%: syntax error: operand expected (error token is "%")
12:55  Mikachu: then yes, you can't have a % in a -lt comparison
12:56  nimred: Mikachu that is why i use sed
12:57  Mikachu: btw, you're using bash, not zsh
12:57  nimred: oops
12:57  nimred: /bin/sh
12:57  Mikachu: but you only remove %, not %
12:59  nimred: !? not sure i follow you
12:59  nimred: i remove % and ,
12:59  Mikachu: think again
13:02  Mikachu: s/%,// removes only "%,", it doesn't remove "%"
13:05  nimred: Mikachu isn't "sed -e s/%,//" the same as "sed -e s/%//|sed -e s/,//" ?
13:05  Mikachu: no
13:06  nimred: ah can you explain me Mikachu
13:06  Mikachu: you want me to explain to you how a regex works? just go read a guide
13:09  nimred: ok cool :)
13:09  Mikachu: in the meantime, maybe you want sed 's/[%,]//'
13:09  Mikachu: or simply tr -d %,
13:13  nimred: Mikachu yes looks like better :)
13:32  romen: Hi! I was just wondering if anyone could point me toward openssl completion for zsh
13:33  Mikachu: if there isn't one in zsh, it is very unlikely there is one at all
13:33  Mikachu: no reason to not include it
13:34  romen: how difficult is it to grab the bash-completion bits for openssl and port them to zsh?
13:34  Mikachu: zsh can supposedly use bash completion scripts directly
13:35  Mikachu: autoload -U bashcompinit; bashcompinit; then just run the bash thing
13:35  Mikachu: haven't tried it
13:35  romen: I'll try it right now xD thanks Mikachu
13:37  romen: are bashcompinit and compinit mutually exclusive or I can use them both?
13:37  Mikachu: i would guess bashcompinit depends on compinit
13:42  romen: Mikachu: I have "autoload -U bashcompinit && bashcompinit", and I do have a /etc/bash_compeltion.d/openssl file, but then if I <tab> after openssl in the prompt it tries only file completion.  Can you help me?
13:43  Mikachu: did you run the file?
13:43  Mikachu: /etc/bash_completion.d/openssl
13:44  romen: it is not executable
13:44  romen: is there a way to tell zsh to load it as a bashcomp file?
13:44  Mikachu: source it
13:45  romen: /etc/bash_completion.d/openssl:3: command not found: have
13:45  romen: (I have already issued bashcompinit)
13:45  romen: .-(~)------------------------------------------------------------(romen@Hermes)-
13:45  romen: `--> source /etc/bash_completion
13:45  romen: /etc/bash_completion:59: command not found: shopt
13:45  romen: /etc/bash_completion:245: parse error near `]]'
13:45  Mikachu: well, like i said i haven't tried it so i don't know any more
13:46  romen: ok, thanks anyway Mikachu, you've already been very helpful!!
13:46  Mikachu: it's possible that it still needs some porting, i guess
13:46  Mikachu: bashcompinit won't magically make zsh understand bash specific syntax, only the bash specific completion builtins
13:49  romen: found: http://zshwiki.org/home/convert/bash
13:49  romen: it seems to address the problems I've been experiencing
13:49  romen: I just need to define some function and alias to correctly source bash code xD
13:50  romen: thanks again Mikachu!!!
13:53  ft: sombody (not me) should do a proper openssl completion for zsh.
13:58  romen: anyway I can confirm that following those instructions I can succesfully source the bash openssl completion and it seems to work fine
13:59  romen: errata corrige: not completely fine, get some errors during completion from time to time :(
14:00  romen: ft, I'm definitely a newby with zsh so it's not in my power to work on a native zsh completion for openssl :(
14:01  ft: yeah, that wouldn't be a beginner's project. :)
14:01  romen: do you happen to know any good documentation to learn how to properly write zsh completion files? (the manpage of zsh about the completion system does not seem to be intended for zsh beginners, weel at least not for me xD)
14:05  ft: romen: /topic -> wikifaq
14:07  Mikachu: the bash completion doesn't have any descriptions for options, so it doesn't seem that useful
14:09  Mikachu: it seems the only way to list help for a command is to give an invalid argument.. weird design
14:52  iaj: is it possible using command-c to switch between modes in vimmode in zsh?
14:53  asyd: just write a widget?
14:55  Valodim: iaj: bindkey jj vi-cmd-mode-samepos
14:55  Valodim: iaj: try that. it's awesome :)
14:55  Valodim: whoops, the samepos is a widget of mine. minus the -samepos should work.
14:56  iaj: Valodim: hmm yeah I was using jj up until now - the problem is - since I need to do some java coding now which I do in netbeans with jVi plugin - theres no option for using jj :(
14:57  iaj: samepos? oh so it doesn't move to the left when you exit modes?
14:57  Valodim: yeah
14:57  Valodim: that was kinda annoying
14:57  iaj: escape, D ... yeah.. you always had to hD there
15:01  iaj: can I even rebind the "^C" to go to vi-cmd-mode?
15:02  Valodim: no idea
15:10 * ft uses ^d to switch to cmd mode.

22:02  tlonim: btw, why does zsh open a socket -- ll /proc/$$/fd -- shows 6 pointing to a socket
22:03  Mikachu: not here
22:04  thrig: probably the zsh/net/socket module, you doing something with that?
22:04  tlonim: nope..:)
22:04  tlonim: but i am running it inside tmux
22:04  tlonim: yes..
22:04  tlonim: it is tmux related
22:04  Mikachu: funny that ztcp and zsocket don't have completions
22:05  tlonim: but there is a 10 -> /dev/pts/2 
22:05  tlonim: what is 10 open for ?

23:19  isarl: Hi all!  Why might colours in my zsh session not be working properly?
23:20  isarl: To clarify, if I do (for example) "ls --color=auot", I get coloured output.
23:20  isarl: If I don't include the color option, no colour.  I have colours in bash, in the same terminal emulator (gnome-terminal).
23:21  Mikachu: you have an alias for ls in bash
23:21  isarl: Would all my aliases be listed in ~/.bash_aliases?  Because that file has no alias for ls.
23:21  isarl: Also, my prompt should be coloured (it's not, but bash's is).
23:22 --- mren is now known as mren|off
23:22  isarl: Allow me to clarify: it's configured to be coloured, but isn't displaying any.
23:23  Yorokobi: isarl, you need to create an alias for ls in ~/.zshrc to include --color=auto; chances are, it works in bash by default because of a setting in /etc/bashrc
23:24  isarl: Yorokobi: It's not just ls, is what I'm saying.  ls is symptomatic of other issues.
23:24  Yorokobi: As for the prompt, are you autoloading colors? (in .zshrc again: autoload colors && colors)
23:25  isarl: Yorokobi: I have a line which reads, "autoload colors zsh/terminfo"
23:26  isarl: Yorokobi: Ack, I've solved it.  I found another place where it called colors depending on the result of [[ "${terminfo[colors]}" -ge 8 ]]
23:27  isarl: Yorokobi: That was commented out.  Now it is not.  :)  Thank you!
23:27  isarl: Yorokobi: Although it would seem I'll now have to define that alias for ls to force colors...
23:27  Yorokobi: Yep
23:29  isarl: I can define aliases using the "alias" command, and they'll be persistent across sessions?
23:31  variable: isarl, no
23:31  variable: you need to place them into an initialization script
23:31  variable: ie .zshrc 
23:31  isarl: OK, thanks.  I'll do that. =)
