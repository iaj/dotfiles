11:40  Hail_Spacecake: I'm trying to set the color for my prompt
11:41  Hail_Spacecake: I do PS1='%{\e[1;31m%} rest of prompt' but that just displays a literal \e[1;31
11:44  Mikachu: you need $'' at least for the \e
13:32 --- RichiH is now known as RichiH_marriage
16:42  Valodim: there a way to glob dead symlinks?
16:43  Mikachu: yes
16:43  Mikachu: either *(@-) or *(-@)
16:43  Mikachu: i forget
16:44  Mikachu: the latter then
16:44  Mikachu: the opposite is *(@^-@) fwiw, ie only working symlinks
16:46  Valodim: huh. I tried that and it didn't work.. let me give it another shot
16:46  Valodim: ah. works. hah, I did it the other way around :)
16:52  Mikachu: you can also do this
16:52  Mikachu: function brokensym() {
16:52  Mikachu:   [[ -L $REPLY && ! -e `zstat +link $REPLY` ]]
16:52  Mikachu: }
16:52  Mikachu: *(+brokensym)
16:52  Mikachu: but it's slower ;)
16:54  Mikachu: (i didn't know about -@ then obviously
16:54  Valodim: Mikachu: that's what came to mind but I tried to avoid. thanks =)
16:58  tlonim: what is the way to emulate readlink in zsh ?
16:58  tlonim: to get dest
16:59  Valodim: you mean follow the symlink of a given filename?
17:00 --- Yorokobi_ is now known as Yorokobi
17:01  Mikachu: i'm pretty sure if you look six lines above your question, you'll figure it out
17:02  Valodim: remember you can put globbing qualifiers on filenames with no wildcards, too
17:02  Mikachu: you don't really need globbing qualifiers at all
17:03  Mikachu: just do zstat +link asymlink
17:03  tlonim: yeah.. meant following it
17:03  tlonim: should checkout zstat
17:04  Valodim: Mikachu: I find asymlink(-) quite elegant, too :)
17:04  tlonim: zsh is like an ocean(atleast for me) :)
17:04  tlonim: so learning everyday 
17:06  Mikachu: Valodim: well, that only works with an explicit name, and still shows you things that aren't symlinks
17:06  Mikachu: Valodim: and doesn't substitute the target
17:07  Valodim: why only with an explicit name?
17:07  Mikachu: because regularfile(-) still returns regularfile
17:07  iaj: zstat - what do I need to get that command?
17:08  Valodim: oh, - only extends globbing to symlinks but doesn't actually resolve them..
17:08  Valodim: hum. I thought it did
17:08  Valodim: regularfile(:A)
17:08  Valodim: that's what I had in mind :)
17:09  Mikachu: yeah but that also makes the path absolute i think
17:09  Valodim: yeah it does
17:13  Mikachu: http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/810672cc5e23424d724e2dc9e1baf5ed.txt that's useful sometimes
17:43  iaj: can someone point me on how to get zstat to work
17:44  Mikachu: iaj: zmodload zsh/stat
17:44  iaj: thanks :)

21:06  peder2tm: Is there an option in zsh to make it delete only the last part of a path when i press ^w, which would make it similar to vim :)
21:07  peder2tm: so if you have typed in /var/cache/pacman and press ^w, only pacman will be deleted

22:59  paradigm: ezzieyguywuf: you can stop zsh from correcting a line by prepending it with "NOCORRECT".  You can use aliases to do this for a specific command, eg: alias mkdir="nocorrect mkdir"
22:59  paradigm: not exactly what you want, but the closest solution I am aware of
