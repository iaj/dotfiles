06:22  foucist_: hi guys, my right, down, left arrow keys are completely non-functional, i need to map some substitutes
06:22  foucist_: any ideas how i can do that?
06:23  foucist_: not having much luck with bindkey, maybe doing it wrong
06:23  foucist_: any way to make alt-a act like the left arrow key?
06:26  cpr420: bindkey '^[a' backward-char  ??
06:28  foucist_: cpr420: that doesn't seem to do anything, is that for alt-a?  ctrl-a goes to beginning of line by default
06:28  cpr420: yeah, it worked for me
