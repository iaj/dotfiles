22:09  shadeslayer: hi, i was going through https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes and want the colors to come out exactly as in the sporty_256 themes, but currently it shows only white
22:10  shadeslayer: screenshot : http://imagebin.ca/view/eF7o_0v.html
22:12 --- f8l is now known as l8f
22:12  shadeslayer: ah wait... i added export TERM=xterm-256color and it works 
22:12  shadeslayer: thanks anyways :P
22:22  shadeslayer: bah... forgot to ask this, how do i get sysinfo like CPU temp, CPU speed, ram usage etc in zsh>
22:38  picgla1: shadeslayer: you might want to check the byobu initialization files for the code they use to do this.
22:40  shadeslayer: hmm
22:41  ft: some of that information probably heavily depends on the underlying OS, too.
22:46  shadeslayer: ok this is epic
22:46  shadeslayer: i made byobu use zsh
22:46  shadeslayer: as simple as that :P
22:50  shadeslayer: thanks guys :D
23:15  rudi_s: shadeslayer: Btw. You should never set TERM manually in a shell configuration file. It causes problems and setting TERM is the terminal emulator's job. 
23:16  shadeslayer: rudi_s: ok... then how do i fix it?
23:16  rudi_s: shadeslayer: Fix your terminal emulator to set it correctly.
23:17  shadeslayer: no idea how to do that
23:17  rudi_s: shadeslayer: Learn it ;-) What terminal emulator are you using?
23:17  shadeslayer: konsole
23:18  rudi_s: Okay. Check its settings if it can set the TERM variable somewhere, then set it there. I guess it tries to emulate xterm .. 
23:19  shadeslayer: i cant seem to find anything in the konsole settings
23:19  rudi_s: shadeslayer: Check the man page .. if there's nothing, switch to a better terminal emulator ;-)
23:19  shadeslayer: i think i can set it with konsole -p 
23:20  shadeslayer:   -p <property=value>       Change the value of a profile property.
23:20  rudi_s: shadeslayer: You can set that in .Xdefaults as well, just check the man page which option you need.
23:20  rudi_s: *I think, I've never used konsole.
23:21  shadeslayer: theres no man page for konsole ^_^
23:21  rudi_s: Wrong terminal emulator then ...
23:21  shadeslayer: haha :P
