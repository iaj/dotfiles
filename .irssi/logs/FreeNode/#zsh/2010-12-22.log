10:31  Dynetrekk: hi! confused recent bash convert: what happened to shell history?
10:38  et: Dynetrekk: man zshoptions | less -p History
10:39  Dynetrekk: ah okay. I found this, which seems to be thorough: http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2003/msg00335.html
10:39  et: man zshparam | less -p HISTFILE also
10:39  Dynetrekk: et: which, I suppose, can be set with export HISTFILE=... ?
10:43  et: if you don't do something fishy, you don't need to export it, just set it
10:47  Dynetrekk: aha, I've noticed, but I forgot temporarily. for some reason.

18:10  tux0: is there an up-to-date comparison of bash and zsh?

19:08  accel: this is kidna dangerous
19:08  accel: how do I nuke a directory named "~" ?
19:09  accel: i.e. I was doing make INSTALL=~/local
19:09  accel: but instead of expanding the ~, make ended up creating a local directory named "~"
19:09  ft: rm -Rf './~'
19:09  accel: the ./ makes me feel better
19:09  ft: the '' should too.
19:10  ft: zsh's completion will help you too.
19:10  accel: one day, i will use this as an interview question
19:10  ft: heh. :)
19:10  accel: if they nuke ~; they don't get hired

22:03  tweefari: Hi. Have any of you seen http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2031110
22:04 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 91 seconds
22:04  ft: no.
22:04  ft: why?
22:05  tweefari: ft, talks about ZSH.
22:05  tweefari: both in the comments and original story
22:07  ft: He quotes this from the fish site "Configurability is the root of all evil". I can't tell you how wrong I think that is. When I first read it on fish's site, I stopped looking at the shell. there's nowhere you can go from there.
22:08  ft: If the guy thinks that's right, there's not much value in looking what else he has to say. because again, there's nowhere you can go from there.
22:10  tweefari: ft, I think he is arguing for 'sane defaults'.
22:10  thrig: sane for who?
22:10  tweefari: thrig, for the average user.
22:10  thrig: define the average user?
22:10  tweefari: There is more to that article that configuration though.
22:11  tweefari: thrig, that's the $64,000 question, which would require a survey, I suppose.
22:11  ft: if this is about hoping for zsh changing default.
22:11  ft: defaults.
22:11  ft: that's not going to happen.
22:12  ft: Because something that most people miss. and that's not pissing off long time users. And zsh has a long history of taking that very seriously.
22:15  ft: one thing more about the posting: no, you don't need to use escape sequences to get a red prompt for the root user.
22:16  ft: It's a rant nothing more. And I'm not impressed.

23:03  webflo: what's the difference between ~/.zshrc and ~/.zshrc.local?
23:03  ft: one is a standard zsh file, the other is not.
23:03  ft: are you using grml?
23:07  webflo: no i have writte a autocomplet plugin. whats the best way to load this plugin? in zshrc or zshrc.local?
23:08  webflo: i want to wirte a readme file with some basic install instructions ...
23:10  ft: zsh does *not* load zshrc.local
23:10  ft: Unless an existing setup file *load* that file.
23:10  ft: loads.
23:11  ft: grml's zshrc does.
23:11  ft: if you've written a completion function, you don't need to load it at all.
23:11  ft: if installed in a proper location, compinit will pick it up.
23:12  webflo: ok whats the proper location? i thought this gist is mandatory https://gist.github.com/752054
23:13  tweefari: What's GRML I'm hearing about? Is it similar to oh-my-zsh?
23:13  ft: grml is a live cd. It ships an elaborate setup for zsh.
23:14  thrig: Gruesomely Reconfigured, My Lord!
23:14  ft: webflo: a "proper location" is somewhere in fpath.
23:15  tweefari: Oh, ok. I like my oh-my-zsh.
23:15  webflo: tweefari: yes oh-my-zsh is awesome.
23:15  ft: compinit loads compsys. if the user wants compsys (most do) they'll have a compsys run in their setup already.
