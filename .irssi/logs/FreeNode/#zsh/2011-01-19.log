00:12  djweezy: why would zsh have tab completion on one computer for installing stuff but not another. they are using the same ~/.zshrc

09:22  hyperair: hi. is there a way i can customize how zsh invokes the pager when i use '< filename'?
09:23  ft: $READNULLCMD
09:25  hyperair: eh?
09:25  hyperair: aha
09:25  hyperair: thanks
09:29 --- buntfalke is now known as Guest57421
09:29  hyperair: hmm it doesn't seem to work =(
09:34  ft: it surely works here.
09:50  iaj: Hmm I want to copy a dir to another place but take the symlinks as real files...
09:50  iaj: because I want to upload them to my ssh connection afterwards
09:50  Mikachu: cp -L if it's gnu cp
09:51  iaj: Mikachu: thanks for the fast response..
09:51  iaj: 3 seconds.. wow you should go to "who becomes millionaire" or what its english expression is called :D
09:51  Mikachu: it wouldn't really have been more convenient for me to delay the reply ;)
09:52  iaj: :-D

11:40  martin__: hey
11:41  martin__: how can i write a zsh program that lets me do things like ./file command - the right term to search man pages would be enough
11:42  jelly: Hi, does zsh have something like a substring history search?  I'd like to do something like history-search-backward and -forward, but for it to work with a match anywhere inside the line, not just the beginning
11:43  asyd: history-incremental-search-backward ? (control-r with bindkey -e)
11:45  jelly: that's acceptable, thanks
11:49  ptl: when you do ctrl-R, is there any way to specifiy only lines that begin with something? maybe using ^ ?
11:50  ft: did you try it?
12:16  jelly: ptl: use Esc p for that
12:16  jelly: start writing the line, then Esc p (assuming bindkey -e)
12:16  ptl: hmm
12:16  ft: fwiw... using ^ in C-r actually works.
12:17  ptl: both ways work

12:17  ptl: I'm dumb, I thought of ^ but never tried it
12:17  ptl: thanks, people.
12:17  ft: That's why I asked if he tried.
12:17  ptl: sorry, ft
12:17  ft: np.
12:17  ptl: I was watching "Linux Action Show" and got distracted

13:19  iaj: which file would I have to edit when Im logging in to a machine over ssh and want to perform a command just after the zsh shell is up?
13:19  iaj: screen in that case
13:26  iaj: ok nevermind solved it with a variable
13:29  Nyoxi: do you actualy need the shell? isn't 'ssh machine screen' good enough?
13:37  iaj: I want it all to come up automatically:)
