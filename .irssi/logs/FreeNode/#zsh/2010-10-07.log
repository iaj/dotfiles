11:22  tlonim: $#test[(f)@] doesnt work.. how do i obtain length of a newline separated array -- length being number of lines 
11:24  Laynef: tlonim: I think you have to use (f) to create the array, then $#test prints the number of lines
11:24  Laynef: how do you create the test array ?
11:24  tlonim: test=`ll`
11:24  Laynef: ll = ls -l ?
11:25  tlonim: if i do $test[(f)1] etc it works
11:25  tlonim: yes
11:25  Laynef: tlonim: in pure zsh : test=( ${(f)"$(ls -l)"} )
11:26  Laynef: and then print $#test
11:26  Laynef: each entry is a line
11:26  tlonim: ok..
11:27  tlonim: let me try that
11:28  tlonim: Laynef: that works.. 
11:30  tlonim: Laynef: btw, to loop thru each entry test in this case --  how do i do that -- like foreach in perl
11:31  Laynef: for i in $test[1,-1]; do ...
11:32  tlonim: it splits by word here
11:32  tlonim: again i will have to use (f) ?
11:32  Laynef: do you protect $i with double-quotes ?
11:33  tlonim: for x in $test[1,-1];do echo "$x";read;done 
11:33  tlonim: with or without quotes it is not 
11:35  tlonim: ok..to make it shorter , how do i loop thru each entry of say..ls -l and print.. --can this be done in one line 
11:37  Laynef: you can do something like : for x in ${(f)"$(ls -l)"}; do echo $i; done
11:37  Laynef: it works with standard configuration ("zsh -f")
12:00  Laynef: tlonim: does it work ?
12:21  efphe: hello
12:21  efphe: do you know why, when I type `..` and i press TAB, the slash is not automatically pushed in?
12:22  tlonim: Laynef: yeah..it worked ..thanks
12:34  iaj: where can I get information about that (f) part/
12:35  iaj: s,/,?,
12:35  ft: man zshexpn
12:36  ft: I've also written a lengthy page in our wiki about all sorts of expansion flags.
12:38  ft: <http://zshwiki.org/home/scripting/paramflags>
12:39  ft: used to be a german blog post: http://www.bewatermyfriend.org/posts/2006/06-28.22-28-50-tooltime.html
12:47  iaj: ft, cheers!

13:37  myrkraverk: Hmm, can I use the zshism typeset -T CLASSPATH classpath; classpath=( /path/*.jar ) in a make file somehow?
16:16  trym: in bash you can iterate over a space separated list (e.g. from $(ls somedir/)). How do I do that in zsh?
16:17  Yorokobi: The same way
