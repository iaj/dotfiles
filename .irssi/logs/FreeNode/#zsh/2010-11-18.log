14:26  peth: is it possible to implement my own prompt for a zle widget/does anyone know if i can find an example somewhere?
14:47  teratorn: peth: what does that even mean? a prompt for a widget?
14:49  peth: teratorn: i'd like to activate a widget that gives me a prompt below the command line. i want to enter an s// expression there.
14:51  peth: or maybe any arbitray command that the current buffer gets piped to and its output read back into the buffer
14:51  teratorn: I imagine that would be a lot easier
14:52  peth: i thought i'd read something about it and saw that the incremental history search gives you a prompt, so i kind of hoped it wasn't that bad :)
14:55  teratorn: function pipe-buffer () { BUFFER=$(echo -n $BUFFER | command) }; zle -N pipe-buffer
14:55  teratorn: then something like, bindkey -M emacs '<key>' pipe-buffer
14:56  peth: oh, sorry for the misunderstanding. the point is i want to define the command on the fly.
14:57  peth: i know how to do the buffer editing and all. i just don't have any idea how to prompt for the command in parallel
15:00  teratorn: maybe you could just do it by convention... PIPECOMMAND=foo
15:01  teratorn: but I suppose there is a way to read some stuff interactively from inside your widget
15:02  peth: i'll try to find that. the PIPECMD=foo should work, but i'd probably be faster if i just edit-command-lined it then. thanks in any case!
16:55  Yorokobi: What's the zsh way of listing all files over a certain size? I ran across it somewhere on accident and now can't find it. Thanks in advance.
17:11  ft: Yorokobi: *(L...), see the `refcard' from topic.
17:11  ft: (think: length)
17:15  Yorokobi: Thanks
17:46  Mikachu: Yorokobi: *(<tab> is your friend
17:47  Yorokobi: It seems zsh 4.2.1 on Solaris 10 doesn't like it or it isn't actually using recursion despite my use of 'ls -R'
17:47  Yorokobi: Yes, I made sure extended_glob was enabled
