05:10  xinming: In prompt, How do we get the full cwd rather than cwd name?
05:10  Mikachu: %/ instead of %~
05:11  xinming: Ok, thanks
05:11  xinming: Mikachu: but I also hope the $HOME directory show as ~ :-)
05:11  Mikachu: um?
05:12  xinming: Eg, if I am in   /home/xinming  which is my home directory,  It display   ~
05:12  xinming: If I am in other directory which is /usr/local, then, it displays the full path.
05:13  xinming: %/ display the full path always
05:13  Mikachu: you want ~ for $HOME but not ~user for the home of another user?
05:34  xinming: Mikachu: Nope, ~ for $HOME, But full path when I in another path.
05:34  xinming: For now, If I use %/ in PROMPT
05:34  xinming: If I was in $HOME directory, It still display full path.
05:35  Mikachu: %~ mostly shows full paths, unless you named a directory
05:36  xinming: hmm, Oh, sorry, I was wrong.
05:37  xinming: Hmm,  Seems wrong, it'll display the last part of the directory name.
05:37  xinming: I'm wrong. >_<
05:39  xinming: %1~ show the last part.
05:39  xinming: sorry to disturbe

10:20  accel: Suppose I have an hierarchy: ~/foo.c ~/foo/apple.c ~/foo/orange.c ~/foo/bar/test.c <-- I want a command z, such that "z fo<tab>" complets to "z foo.c", "z foo/o<TAB>" completes to "z foo/orange.c", and "z foo/<TAB>" shows "apple.c, orange.c, bar/" <-- How can I do this?

14:49  BrandLeeJones: it's not an specific zsh question, but i'm using it: after exit man, the current view of the manpage disapears and i see the screen before viewing the manpage. goole search tells me to use rxvt instead of xterm. but i'm not sure of any sideaffects. has anyone similar problems and a solution to configure xterm to keep the manpage after exit man?
14:50  fow: What are you actually using to view man pages? less?
14:50  BrandLeeJones: man xyz
14:51  strull: echo $PAGER
14:51  strull: quick solution might be man xzy|cat
14:51  BrandLeeJones: echo $PAGER returns an empty line
14:52  BrandLeeJones: man xyz | more  -> works
14:55  BrandLeeJones: setting PAGER to more, solves the problem. THANKS :-)
14:55  fow: if you're using GNU less, try the -X option. I'm not sure if other lesses support it. export LESS="$LESS -X"; man xyz
14:57  strull: there is also MANPAGER
14:57  BrandLeeJones: @fow: i tried this before an it doesn't work. the osx implementation of less has no -X switch
14:58  fow: ah
14:58  strull: one more reason to stay away from apple :)
14:58  BrandLeeJones: @strull: thanks
14:59  strull: np
15:48  damex: hi, i'v interested in getting zsh eating lower memory. how did i can do that ? now its eating 130mb~ or more per instance and here is my zshrc http://paste.pocoo.org/show/318872 
16:14  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: my osx less has -X or --no-init, from the man page
16:16  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: it also says that it is gnu less, on the bottom. oh well, might still not work exactly like linux less
16:19  BrandLeeJones: @member:identifier:dynetrekk: ok, you are right ;-). in the SYNOPSIS the -X switch isn't shown and the -X switch down't solve my problem. 
16:19  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: right. but, it says that it's gnu less, no less ;)
16:19  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: what was your problem btw?
16:21  BrandLeeJones: @Dynetrekk: after exit man, the current viewed manpage disapeared. i want to keep them on screen. i solve the problem by setting $MANPAGER=more
16:21  BrandLeeJones: instead of less
16:22  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: aha... this is a setting of less, I believe. more is a terrible pager compared to less. you can't even go backwards IIRC
16:22  Dynetrekk: I would recommend doing someting else than using more
16:24  BrandLeeJones: Dynetrekk: i'm able to scroll forward an back with the arrow keys
16:25  BrandLeeJones: Dynetrekk: until now i haven't recognized a difference
16:25  BrandLeeJones: Dynetrekk: except the exit behaviour
16:36  Dynetrekk: BrandLeeJones: oh, it works now? good for more
16:36  Dynetrekk: doesn't work for me
16:37  Dynetrekk: wtf, 'man more' gives me the man page of less
16:51  BrandLeeJones: member:Dynetrekk: 'man more' --> manpage of less, me too
16:51  Dynetrekk: weird shit.
16:51  Dynetrekk: the osx more seems to be a reincarnation of less
17:00  BrandLeeJones: Dynetrekk: this may explain the issue: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/more/Attic/main.c?hideattic=0
17:01  Dynetrekk: less becomes more, and more is no more. great commit comment :)
17:01  Dynetrekk: more is crap, so fine by me
17:01  Dynetrekk: hey good for you, then you can use more as man pager ;)
17:02  lucs: Hi.
17:03  lucs: I'm trying to figure out a way to get functionality similar to 'preexec', but for after a command executes; I'd like a 'postexec', but that appears not to exist.
17:03  lucs: And ideas how I could accomplish this?
17:03  fow: lucs, precmd?
17:04  lucs: Hmm... I'll read the docs now...
17:04  lucs: Heh. Makes a lot of sense. I'll try it out and see if I get the result I need.
17:09  lucs: fow: Yep, that's what I needed.
17:09  lucs: Thanks!
17:10  lucs: I spent about an hour googling for 'post' this and 'post' that, I was looking at the problem in the wrong way, eh.
17:10  ahmed-tux: hi zsh
17:10  ahmed-tux: thanks a lot zsh 
19:20  pierron: Hi,
19:23  pierron: I recently had issues with the whole completion of zsh.   I've investigated and found that "_main_complete" was not defined.  I've look at the installed packaged and on the 812 files which are in share/zsh/4.3.10/functions/, only 238 are loaded.
19:25  thrig: never seen that problem. How did you configure completion?
19:26  pierron: I don't changed it since this issue happend.  I don't think this is directly related to the completion.
19:26  pierron: I did not changed it before.
19:27  pierron: It happend also on currently running instances of zsh.
19:27  damex: q
19:28  pierron: cat * > /dev/null does not reports unreadable files.
19:30  pierron: the problem suddently happend with zsh-4.3.10, but a previous installed version (4.3.9) seems to work.
19:31  ft: the completion issue you mean?
19:31  pierron: yes.
19:32  ft: rm ~/.zcompdump
19:32  ft: restart zsh.
19:33  pierron: that's did it ;)
19:33  pierron: Thanks.
19:34  ft: question 14 of /topic -> wikifaq also suggests trying that. :)
19:34  ft: in #zsh, /topic is worth a read.
19:35  ft: (Just for next time, in case nobody is around)
19:36  ft: need to catch a bus. bbl.
20:54  loupe: is there any way to systematically modify every command?
20:54  loupe: i'd like to wrap everything in a 'time' and a 'script'
21:39  csexton: Is there any reason to not alias git to 'noglob git'? I want to be able to use HEAD^, but didn't know if disabling globbing for all git commands would be bad

22:47  Arrowmaster: csexton: you can disable nomatch
22:49  thrig: always handy when you have pyromaniacs on staff
22:51  csexton: interesting, when I unset nomatch it shows up in `setopt` as "nonomatch"
22:56  csexton: Arrowmaster: that does work for git and the HEAD^ issue, thanks
22:56  Mikachu: csexton: simply use HEAD~ instead and you'll have no problems
22:57  csexton: Mikachu: Ahh, I had been using HEAD~1 -- but was annoyed with the massive typing overhead. HEAD~ solves that.
22:58  Mikachu: also suggest git symbolic-ref h HEAD
