02:41  pattern: i have two files in the current directory:  "INSTALL" and "install-sh"
02:41  pattern: when i type: less ins
02:41  pattern: and hit TAB, i see "insTALL"
02:42  pattern: and i have to either type another character to disambiguate it and hit tab again, or hit tab two or more times to choose one of the files
02:43  Nomexous: Maybe you have a matcher-list zstyle in your config?
02:43  pattern: is there any way that the first time i hit tab, zsh will just automatically select one of them?
02:44  pattern: hmm... yep.. looks like it
02:44  Nomexous: Removing that matcher-list zstyle will get rid of case-insensitve completion.
02:45  pattern: i do want case-insensitive completion
02:45  pattern: i just don't want the mixed-case that zsh gives me when i hit tab
02:45  pattern: i just want to type "ins" followed by tab and have zsh automatically select the first file ("INSTALL", in this case)
02:45  pattern: rather than the mixed-case "insTALL"
02:46  Mikachu: that would be annoying if you also had a file instrument.txt or so
02:46  Mikachu: you would be unable to type more letters to disambiguate that
02:46  Mikachu: because it already filled in tall
02:46  pattern: hmm
02:48  pattern: maybe i don't want that after all, then... :)
02:50  pattern: the thing is that in the case of the two files being "INSTALL" and "install-sh", typing "ins" followed by TAB could simply complete the first and beep (to indicate the completion is ambiguous)
02:50  pattern: in the case when there's also a file "instrument.txt" along with the others, and i type "ins" followed by TAB, zsh could just beep
02:52  pattern: i basically want the exact same behavior as it has now.. except for the mixed case
02:52  pattern: the mixed case does add a visual indication that there's ambiguity.. but that could be accomplished just as well using the case of the first match instead
02:52  pattern: along with a beep

16:11  steven_t: hey guys
16:12  steven_t: i tried to get completion working on zsh (4.3.9 or 4.3.10) but when i try to press tab, the thing i typed is then repeated
16:12  steven_t: so like when i type "git[tab]" i see "git git" and when i backspace as much as i can, my prompt then looks like "$ git " instead of just "$ " like it should be..
16:12  steven_t: have any of you run into this? i tried googling it but dont even know what to call it
16:14  fow: steven_t, /topic -> wikifaq -> #8
16:17  steven_t: way good news
16:17  steven_t: fow == yay
16:29  steven_t: thanks bro
16:41  imc: hello, i'm quite new to zsh, i installed the "oh-my-zsh" thingie. Now i've set the RPROMPT (showing battery status) but with RPROMPT set the cursor go the the far left (not at the end of PROMPT). using urxvt
16:42  imc: (faulty program showing battery, nevermind)
