13:51  c3l: teratorn: no, no multi-line prompt
13:51  c3l: I see whats causing my problem with the confirmation for for example rm. its the colorization for stderr as showin here http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Zsh#Colorize_STDERR . why is this causing issues? and how can I colorize the stderr without any problems? (my confirmation for eg. rm is not shown at all, but it does respond to my y/n)
13:52  Mikachu: that is a pretty hacky thing to do and probably won't work most of the time
13:53  teratorn: fitting that it's on a gentoo wiki, then!
13:54  Mikachu: ;u
13:54  c3l: oh, how sad. there isnt any other way to achieve this then? I liked it for the things it worked for 
14:00  teratorn: c3l: anything is possible!
14:07  c3l: any idea how? ;)

23:30  iaj: hey mates
23:31  iaj: dunno if someone can help - but I'll just shoot I guess - the path completion in zsh is awesome - so since I guess there are quite some vimmers here - is there a way to achieve that behaviour in vim?
23:59  croque-monsieur: Is there anyone with a ~/.zshrc with viM bindings?
