09:52  Maahes: I forgot the zsh syntax for setting your term environment, someone know it?
09:54  mqt: you mean the $TERM env variable?
09:54  Maahes: eh, I think its only path that differs from bash, regardless, I forgots it
09:54  Maahes: mqt: yes
09:54  mqt: export TERM=....
09:54  Maahes: thanks
10:33  aiju: how to get the special keys (like cursor keys) working with urxvt?
10:37  nimred: which way to make redirecting output to a file and overwrite if file exists ?
10:37  asyd: >|
10:40  slashbeast: aiju: you had to make own binds
10:40  nimred: asyd: ah cool :)
10:40  slashbeast: aiju: like bindkey "[press control-V, press up arrow" command
10:41  aiju: christ, can't you just read termcap?
10:41  slashbeast: or use tput
10:41  slashbeast: http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/packages/zsh/zshrc?rev=1.13 check this.
10:48  aiju: all this terminal stuff makes me feel like i'm using a ASR-33â€¦
10:48  slashbeast: yeah keybinds sucks but I configured my few years ago and forgot about i
10:48  slashbeast: it
10:49  aiju: perhaps i should just use 9term + rc lol
10:51  slashbeast: I can send you my config with binds for urxvt if you like.
10:51  aiju: thanks, not necessary
