19:10  philips: Why does the first example print out xterm but the second works as expected? Maybe I am reading the docs on the || test operator wrong? http://gist.github.com/617928
19:13  Mikachu: err
19:13  Mikachu: TERM is xterm
19:13  Mikachu: so it's not one of foobar123* or rxvt
19:13  Mikachu: therefore it's not printed
19:16  philips: Mikachu: but in the first example it _is_ printed...
19:17  Mikachu: oh sorry, i thought you wrote you expected the second to print it
19:17  philips: Mikachu: It is all related to this fwiw: http://github.com/philips/oh-my-zsh/commit/aab235f6121a93b81a425d522a0c7f2aaac946bd
19:18  philips: Mikachu: And the manual on conditional expressions for zsh would lead me to believe it should work " exp1 || exp2     true if either exp1 or exp2 is true.
19:18  philips: "
19:19  Mikachu: it seems to only break for =~
19:19  Mikachu: also, havinig the = first and then the =~ still works
19:20  Mikachu: % if [[ 1 =~ 0 || 0 = 1 ]]; then echo yes; fi
19:20  Mikachu: yes
19:20  Mikachu: moving the ~ to the second one doesn't succeed
19:20  Mikachu: also fun
19:20  Mikachu: % if [[ 1 =~ 1 && 1 = 1 ]]; then echo yes; fi
19:21  Mikachu: doesn't succeed
19:21  Mikachu: seems weird, but after =~, && and || reverse meaning?
19:21  Mikachu: no that's not it
19:21  Mikachu: heh
19:22  Mikachu: Something Weird is definitely going on with the =~ operator though
19:22  philips: Mikachu: ok, I am new to zsh and didn't know if I was missing something obvious
19:22  Mikachu: not obvious to me why it should break only in this circumstance
19:22  Mikachu: i can mail the list and ask
19:24  philips: Mikachu: which list? I am flailing around trying to find the source control and devel mailing list for zsh now ;)
19:25  Mikachu: http://www.zsh.org/mla/
19:25  Mikachu: do you want to be mentioned in the mail, ccd?
19:27  philips: Mikachu: sure, brandon@ifup.org, thanks :)
19:27  philips: I will subscribe in the meantime. zsh-workers I am guessing?
19:27  Mikachu: yeah

20:22  sshc: How do I test whether the string $VAR is empty?
20:24  sshc: zsh seems to expect integer comparison for 'if [ "$VAR" -ne "" ]; then'
20:25  sshc: Ah, !=
20:29  Yorokobi: or -z or -n
