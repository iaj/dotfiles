02:23  checkers: help. I set GLOBAL_RCS but /etc/zlogout is still getting run when I exit my login shell
02:25  checkers: here's what I see:
02:25  checkers: % unset GLOBAL_RCS 
02:25  checkers: % echo $?
02:25  checkers: 1
02:25  checkers: % set -x
02:25  checkers: % 
02:25  checkers: +/etc/zlogout:7> clear
02:25  fow: GLOBAL_RCS is an option, not a parameter (you meant unsetopt not unset)
02:27  checkers: d'oh, ta
02:28  checkers: also, is there some way to find the location of the system zlogout file? I've seen it in three places:[/usr/local]/etc/[zsh/]zlogout

03:18  brianx: i think ^L is bound to zle clear-screen. i'm binding ^L to a function that tries to set $?=0 and then calls zle clear-screen. but i can never seem to reset the exit status.
03:27  brianx: it's as if $? is saved before the widget is called and restored after.
04:19  hpt: hi, I want to complete in history by esc-/, but seems it doesn't work. 
04:32  thrig: what ever do you mean by "doesn't work"? what did you try? what happened?
05:32  hpt: thrig: I typed a 'bind', which I issued a 'bindkey' command before, and then press 'alt-/' ,nothing happened.

10:21  teratorn: tlonim: what is <> supposed to be?
10:23  Mikachu: tlonim: [[ condition1 || condition2 && condition3 ]]
10:24  tlonim: i meant how associativity is considered
10:24  tlonim: <> is some zsh statement
10:24  teratorn: tlonim: well OK, do it just the way you typed it....
10:24  teratorn: tlonim: explain how that is now what you want :)
10:24  tlonim: Mikachu: i meant the && is for the first conidtion
10:24  tlonim: like a ternary operator
10:25  tlonim: ah..that is a better way to put it
10:25  Mikachu: well, you can run what you wrote, but it's not a ternary operator
10:25  Mikachu: if <>1 succeeds, <>2 will also run
10:25  tlonim: [[ condition to test ]] && statement1 || statement2  where && anad || both consider first condition
10:26  tlonim: Mikachu: so without if;then i cant do with ^ alone right ?
10:26  teratorn: hmm
10:26  Mikachu: you want "if"
10:26  tlonim: i know :)
10:26  tlonim: i meant without if
10:26  Mikachu: there is no other way
10:26  teratorn: yeah
10:26  tlonim: like C ternary operator
10:26  Mikachu: well, no other shorter way
10:26  Mikachu: you can of course come up with much more convoluted ways to do it that don't use if
10:26  tlonim: ok
10:27  teratorn: [[ cond ]] && expr; [[ cond ]] || expr
10:27  teratorn: but thats lame
