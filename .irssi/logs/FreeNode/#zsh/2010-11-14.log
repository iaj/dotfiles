20:17  bottiger: I have a bash-script which rsyncs som data from a remote server to the local computer. The script is started by root, but I want it to run as my local user because root doesn't have the ssh-keys to login to the server. I tried putting "su username" in the top of the script but without any luck
20:18  bottiger: zsh-script of cource, but I do't know if there's any difference in this case :)
20:19  Valodim: if [[ $USER == "root" ]]; then sudo $0
20:19  Valodim: er, needs -u localhost at the sudo
20:20  bottiger: Valodim: what do you mean by -u localhost?
20:21  Valodim: mh. I wanted to type -u localuser
20:21  Valodim: got distracted by some guy sitting next to me :P
20:24  bottiger: Valodim: and does $0 mean the rest of the script?
20:25  bottiger: sudo -u only seems to run a command as the local user
20:25  Valodim: yes it does, and $0 refers to the script itself
20:26  bottiger: Valodim: ahh - okay
20:26  bottiger: thank you very much then
