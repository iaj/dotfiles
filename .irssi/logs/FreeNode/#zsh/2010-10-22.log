00:00  derdon: resixian: extended globbing
00:00  derdon: resixian: use ~ to exclude certain patterns
00:21  resixian: derdon: ty for the pointer, i don't see where to add that for a specific command?
00:22  derdon: resixian: I don't either, sorry
00:22  derdon: resixian: you mean to do it automatically when typing 'git add version.*<TAB>'?
00:23  derdon: sounds too tricky for me
00:23  derdon: (or "to me"?)
00:23  resixian: yeah, if its simple i would try it, because deleting all the extras can be a pain:
00:23  resixian: git ci version.c version.h version.lst version.o
00:24  resixian: ^ from there i'd have to back up over version.lst an dversion.o
00:24  resixian: it seemed to me zsh is very smart about completion though. 
00:25  fow: version.[ch] or version.(*~o~lst) or version.(c|h) or ... depending on what exactly it is you want to accomplish
00:25  fow: All of these are documented in man zshexpn
00:26  Mikachu: i think if you add *.o to your ignore file in git, the completer won't complete them (but it might if you type a * and use an expander)
00:27  resixian: i have *.o in gitignore, but i do use the <filename>.*<TAB> 
00:28  resixian: Mikachu: you have solved my problem, i need to stop using '*' so much

14:56  Bucciarati: hi
14:56  Mikachu: hello
14:56  Bucciarati: why does ". .zshrc" search all across $PATH but not in the current directory ?
14:57  Mikachu: that's what source is for
14:57  Mikachu:        source file [ arg ... ]
14:57  Mikachu:               Same  as `.', except that the current directory is always searched and
14:57  Mikachu:               is always searched first, before directories in $path.
14:57  Mikachu: you can use . ./.zshrc of course
15:02  Bucciarati: right, it is documented  :)  thanks Mikachu
