00:59  whiteinge: the very-ridiculous waaaay-outside-the-scope of vcs_info is that the vcs_info framework is perfect for detecting when you cd into a virtualenv directory (a self-contained Python environment).

01:00  whiteinge: almost definitely probably not worth discussing, but I wanted to anyway. :P

02:14  aaronf0: how do you set zsh to ignore case when completing? maybe i'm using the wrong terminology, because google isn't helping.

02:22 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 84 seconds
02:23  estragib: also compinstall should offer something like it
02:25  aaronf0: yea, i've set one of my boxes up with it, but i can't figure out which one and/or how i did it. :P
02:25  teratorn: I would like a binding that prints the context string as if completion where attempted at the current cursor position
02:26  estragib: aaronf0: http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showpost.php?s=0416507fedfeeabb021ec8a8dadfb4fb&p=31604&postcount=5
02:34  aaronf0: estragib: that got it working, thanks.
02:35  estragib: np
02:36  aaronf0: don't suppose you would know why zsh inserts a ~ on my laptop when i hit delete?
02:37  thrig: that's probably not due to ZSH
02:37  aaronf0: works fine on my server, so its definitely my fault.
02:37  aaronf0: thrig: probably not, but it was working properly under bash.
02:37  thrig: what is the Terminal being used? what is TERM set to? etc.
02:39  aaronf0: thrig: Terminal.app, xterm-color
02:39  aaronf0: thrig: i'm pretty sure this is osx being stupid.
02:40  teratorn: ah, there is already one built in: ^Xh
02:45  thrig: aaronf0: I don't have that problem on OS X. You've probably done something to the Terminal.app config.
02:46  aaronf0: probably.
02:48  aaronf0: thrig: do you use the built in zsh, or you compile your own?
02:50  thrig: builtin
03:00  aaronf0: thrig: ^[[3~ was what i needed to bind
03:01  aaronf0: thrig: it looks like settings>keyboard> has it set correctly though :P
03:14  Bucciarati: hi, when I press tab, I want "complete as much as possible, and if hitting a directory, go on completing as much as possible"
03:16  Bucciarati: I'm trying various incantations of auto_list, auto_param_slash, ... to no avail
03:17  Bucciarati: the closest I got is defining a new zle widget, that goes like:  zle expand-or-complete-prefix; if [[ "${BUFFER[-1]}" == / ]] ; then zle expand-or-complete-prefix ; fi

14:49  anon33_: how do I expand the current path? ie - i'd like to say "ln -fs <full path to pwd> ..."
14:52  et: $(pwd)
14:53  anon33_: thanks :D
14:54  ft: also $PWD
15:27  et: *sigh*
15:27  et: is there a way to "exec zsh" in a .bashrc so i don't break scp?
15:29  ft: [ "$PS1" != '' ] && exec zsh?
15:29 * ft guesses.
15:35  et: seems to work. how does it work?
15:36  et: just before i did a if tty>/dev/null; then exec zsh; fi ... are there differences?
15:46  ft: AFAIK, bash only sets $PS1 if it's an interactive shell.
15:50  et: seems that way, thanks (at least http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/bashref/IsthisShellInteractive.html says the same)
15:59  kamcio2603: ft: you're there?
16:01  ft: kamcio2603: more or less.
16:01  kamcio2603: ok
16:02  kamcio2603: ft: do you know how to do in zsh dynamic completion system?
16:04  ft: didn't we have this conversation before? :)
16:05  kamcio2603: maybe
16:05  kamcio2603: but i still dont know how to do
16:06  ft: My reply at the time was "what would that be?".
16:06  ft: Then you wanted to show me your bash completion thing.
16:06  ft: And I said, I never used bash.
16:07  kamcio2603: yes
16:07  ft: (irc logging++)
16:07  kamcio2603: my ~/irclogs => 43MB
16:07  ft: 566M    .irclogs
16:08  kamcio2603: program completion => makes return to stdout : one two three four
16:08  kamcio2603: program completion one => ..... zsh bash dash sh tclsh
16:08  kamcio2603: etc..
16:09  kamcio2603: all must be based on my software
16:10  silas: Hi all.
16:10  kamcio2603: ft: do you know what i expected?
16:12  ft: no, I don't know what your goal is.
16:12  kamcio2603: when i type "program " then zsh make completion and print all available completions
16:12  silas: Completion question:  where is the documentation of the $words array?  What is the best manner to get an argument for an option?  E.g.:  I'm typing `command -a A -b <TAB>` -> When I hit tab on the -b argument, I need to get the argument passed for -a.  What is the best way to make that from an autocomplete function?
16:17  kamcio2603: silas: you're doing dynamic completion (completion based on your software) ?
16:17  silas: kamcio2603: no, I'm modifying the _man completion.
16:18  silas: kamcio2603: _man completion sets a default MANPATH if it is not set already.  I just want to get the argument passed by -M and add it to MANPATH :-)
16:19  ft: kamcio2603: If you want to have completion based on a command's output, then yes. That's possible. Many *many* existing completions do that already.
16:19  ft: like _aptitude.
16:19  ft: or _tmux.
16:23  kamcio2603: ok,i check it
16:28  Yorokobi: Has anyone updated _git to support git-submodule?
16:29  kamcio2603: ft: "bashcompinit" in zsh completion what this file doing?
16:29  kamcio2603: its a converter from bash to zsh completer?
16:30  ft: Yorokobi: check cvs. :)
16:30  Yorokobi: w00t
16:31  ft: kamcio2603: it defines a few functions to support some bash completion idioms.
16:31  ft: kamcio2603: if zsh groaks the rest of the completion's syntax it *may* be able to use them.
16:31  ft: It's not a converter.
16:32  kamcio2603: ah
16:32  Yorokobi: groak or grok?
16:33  kamcio2603: ft: in _aptitude completion is as "static"
16:33  kamcio2603: _arguments -C \
16:33  kamcio2603: .... 
16:33  kamcio2603: ;<
16:33  ft: grok.
16:34  ft: _arguments can call all sorts of code. Including external commands.
16:35  ft: It can be used for "static" completions (although, in zsh, not even _files is really static).
16:36  ft: You'll have to understand how zsh completion works before you'll be able to write anything non-trivial for it.
16:37  Yorokobi: Bummer, CVS/git #HEAD version of _git doesn't have support for git-submodule ... might have to add it myself. :)
16:38  ft: Yorokobi: don't forget to send a patch afterwards! :)
16:39  Yorokobi: If I can get it to work, I shan't forget.

I just added PATH to my .zprofile in order to get sourced by my MacVim - which it does because :echo $PATH gives me a correct path in MacVim... however :!which ctags  gives me /usr/bin/ctags  but should be ~/bin/ctags (because ~/bin/ comes first in $PATH) - any idea/
