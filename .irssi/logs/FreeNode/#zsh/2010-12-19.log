17:40  jballanc: Does anyone know how I might make all command output that exceeds the current screen height open in less?
17:49 * strull would be very surprised if this is even possible
17:49  Mikachu: it would produce very weird results with interactive programs
17:50  strull: this too
17:50  Mikachu: you could just pipe everything to less -FRX

18:18  jballanc: Hmm...that could work
19:05  variable: Is there some way I could make ctrl+x == "disown" ?
19:05  variable: ie - instead of hitting ctrl+z and then disown
19:06  Mikachu: you can make ctrl-x do what ctrl-z does
19:07  Mikachu: but then ctrl-z wouldn't
19:09  variable: Mikachu, no - ctrl z just suspends it
19:09  variable: I want it equal to suspend + disown
19:09  variable: and I want ctrl+z to work as normal
19:09  Mikachu: then no, you can't
19:10  variable: alright
19:43  variable: is there a better way to do this http://pastebin.com/KJNB40m3 ?
19:44  thrig: sshd often sets certain ENV variables for child processes
19:44  variable: thrig, any pointers as to which ones?  SSH_TTY ?
19:45  thrig: ssh someserver 'set > what-is-set-via-ssh'; set > what-isnt; diff what-*
19:46  variable: oh - right :-)
19:46  thrig: or read the sshd sources, that's also educational
19:47  thrig: SSH_CLIENT is what I'm using for something, but I set that up years ago
19:48  variable: thrig, alright
19:49  variable: SSH_TTY looks good
19:51  variable: thrig,       [[ -n "$SSH_TTY" ]] appears to work
