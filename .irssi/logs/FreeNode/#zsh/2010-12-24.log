00:05  teratorn: berniyh: I don't understand your first question
00:06  teratorn: berniyh: as for the second you should be able to bind the key so long as zsh "sees" it
00:06  teratorn: berniyh: at a zsh prompt hit Ctrl+v
00:06  teratorn: then press the key
00:06  teratorn: do you see anything?
00:07  iaj: ft: are you up.. im just looking at the file concerning the vibinds that you pasted earlier - can you tell me what exactly you are doing w/ it?
00:11 --- f8l is now known as f|l
00:23  pattern: what's the idiomatic way to do something like the following in zsh?
00:23  pattern: for i in $(cat foo)
00:23  pattern: do
00:23  pattern:   bar $i
00:23  pattern: done
00:23  thrig: while read i; do bar $i; done < foo
00:23  pattern: thank you
00:25  Nomexous: Doesn't read do by lines?
00:26  Nomexous: $(cat foo) would do by whitespace.
00:35  pattern: i'd like to read by lines anyway
00:38  thrig: (echo but; echo -n beware) | while read l; do echo $l; done
00:43 --- mren is now known as mren|off
00:54  iaj: while read i; do bar $i; done < foo      would that be the same as cat foo | while read i; do bar $i; done    ?

01:03  fow: effectively, yes

04:52  accel: is there a way I can config zsh so that typign in "cd" brings me back to ~/blahblah/ rather than ~/ ?
04:53  eikenberry: Changing $HOME works. Probably not ideal though.
04:54 --- peth_ is now known as peth
04:54  eikenberry: Seems like a function could do it.
04:55  ft: function cd () { if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then builtin cd ~/blah; return; fi; builtin cd "$@"; }
04:56 * eikenberry nods. Yeah. Like that.
05:01  accel: ft eikenberry : nice, thanks!
05:43  variable: is it possible to remove a valid command from the completions list?
05:44  variable: accel, curious - why do you want to do that?
05:44  accel: do what?
05:44  variable: <accel> is there a way I can config zsh so that typign in "cd" brings me back to ~/blahblah/ rather than ~/ ?
05:45  accel: I spend most of my time in ~/blahblah rather than in !/

09:12  berniyh: teratorn: if I for example try `print FOO=dir1(:a)` and press TAB, nothing happens, but I would like to expand the path of dir1 to the absolute path
09:12  berniyh: it seems to work if there is no cmd in front
09:13  berniyh: regarding the second question, pressing the key shows nothing
09:16  berniyh: it's defined as #define XK_Undo                          0xff65
09:24  teratorn: well you have to rig it somehow so that pressing that key sends an escape sequence to the shell
09:24  teratorn: then you can bind that
09:24  teratorn: but i've got no clue how you do that

11:10  rudi_s: nimred: | tr -d ' ' ?
11:21  nimred: rudi_s: and to delete newline character ?
11:25  nimred: | tr -d '\n' doesn't work
11:28  rudi_s: nimred: It should, and works fine for me.
11:28  rudi_s: Maybe you also need \r: tr -d ' \n\r'
12:05  nimred: big shit in god's ass
14:30  whitedragon: Hey folks. Whats a good way to disable history for zsh session? I would like to be able to type in: "nohist<CR>" and the history is disabled for that session.
14:39  asyd: whitedragon: there is an option (iirc) to ignore a command in history by prefixing it by a space
14:39  asyd: but don't be ashamed to watch porn ;p
14:39  asyd: whitedragon: HIST_IGNORE_SPACE

15:15  trhodes: it would also be nice, (with HIST_IGNORE_SPACE) once you prefix a command with a space, have the next line default to a space prefix
15:18  whitedragon: trhodes: Yeah, that would be nice, too.
