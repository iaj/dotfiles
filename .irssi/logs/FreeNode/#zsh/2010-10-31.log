22:52  jajmon: hello good sirs! i need to write a script that renames a bunch of files. i want to insert a string in each filename (or search/replace a string, whatever is simplest) i'm a total noob writing shell script but i think i can manage if i just get pointed in the right direction
22:53  Nomexous: Could you be more specific? zsh provides zmv, which might fit your needs perfectly.
22:54  Nomexous: It won't really help you learn zsh, but it might be convenient.
23:06  jajmon: i want to put "bar" in  "foobar" so it becomes "foobarbar"
23:06  jajmon: for all files in a directory
23:13  fow: zmv -n 'foobar' 'foobarbar'
23:13  fow: (-n is dry-run
23:13  fow: )
23:16  jajmon: do you know if zmv comes with mac osx?
23:17  jajmon: its not in my path..
23:18  jajmon: ive got a /usr/share/zsh/4.3.9/functions/zmv
23:18  estragib: you'll have to autoload it first
23:19  mhi^: Hey. Short question: zsh won't complete through directories if I want to run a certain program. Like.. "vlc dir1/dir2/blubb.avi". (I have "compctl -g '*.avi' vlc" in my zshrc.)
23:20  jajmon: estragib, thanks just found out :) google is your friend
23:22  Mikachu: mhi^: try (instead) compdef '_files -g "*.avi"' vlc
23:23  mhi^: Mikachu: just found zshcompctl and the -f flag. :) Is there a fundamental difference between compdef and compctl?
23:23  mhi^: I remember reading something about "old system" and "new system".
23:24  mhi^: And one was significantly faster.
23:26  mhi^: Nevermind, also explained by the manpage. compctl is old and I'll have a look at zshcompsys now.
23:28  Mikachu: old and new here is a bit misleading, the new one is almost 10 years old too by now
23:29  mhi^: Hah.
23:30  mhi^: Oh, another thing which comes to mind: At work my zsh expands "man signa[tab]" to "man 2 signal", here it only completes to "man signal". How do I get the former behaviour?
23:31  jajmon: fow, thanks alot!
23:31  jajmon: had no idea zmv existed, really nice!
