08:23 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 85 seconds
08:29  tlonim: to add to that, i would like to know how to get status/poll completion of a coproc 
13:15  tlonim: can zsh be made to remember completion history ? and sort by which ones were chose before 
13:21  ft: tlonim: I guess you need to write that one. :)
16:02  teratorn: has anyone set up ssh connection caching when completing files on remote hosts over ssh?
16:03  teratorn: basically I just want the first connect to hang around for a minute or so
16:03  asyd: hmm it's not provided by _ssh afaik so you probably need to code it yourself
16:03  teratorn: so it can be used for future completions
16:03  teratorn: yes, was hoping someone already did it
16:06  Mikachu: openssh has a master/slave mode
16:06  Mikachu: where if you have a connection open to somewhere, other sessions will use the same connection
16:07  Mikachu: you'll still have to make that master connection manually though
16:07  Mikachu: Host *
16:07  Mikachu: controlmaster auto
16:07  Mikachu: controlpath ~/ssh-%r@%h:%p
16:09  Mikachu: hm, there's a new option since i looked into this last, ControlPersist, look at that too in man ssh_config
16:09  Mikachu: if you set it to 300 or so i guess it will hang around for five minutes after the last tabcomplete
16:10  Yorokobi: The Control* options are handy
16:11  Mikachu: i guess something like 30 is probably enough
17:23  WoodsDog: does zsh set the umask specifically anywhere?  my bash users have on umask, my zsh users have a different
17:27  rudi_s: WoodsDog: Check the /etc files. But normally zsh won't change it.
