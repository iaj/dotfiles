09:37  haxley: hi everyone
09:38  haxley: I got some problems with the completion
09:38  haxley: theres some alias inst="sudo aptitude install"
09:39  haxley: now completion works for sudo aptitude install<TAB>
09:39  haxley: but not for inst<TAB>
09:39  haxley: setopt MULTIOS SHARE_HISTORY autocd extendedglob COMPLETE_ALIASES glob bareglobqual nullglob rcexpandparam extendedglob
09:39  haxley: thus aliases should be completed.
09:40  ft: man zshoptions | less -p'COMP.*ALIAS'
09:42  haxley: thx
09:42  haxley: thats kind of fucking stupid
09:42  haxley: -_-
09:42  haxley: sry should have done that too
10:34  iaj: is there a wise guide on how to create a .zsh configuration that can be run on multiple machines? 
10:37  mkae: iaj: I use my zshrc on multiple mashines. I use zkb for the different keyboard-settings and include a .zsh-$(hostname) for host specific settings
10:39  iaj: mkae: so only .zshrc + a zsh-host only those 2 files?
10:39  iaj: mkae: are you able to post your .rc?
10:40  mkae: yes, just 2 files. the .zshrc is everywhere the same... Host specific things (named directories, aliases...) are in the .zsh-hostname file.
10:40  mkae: i post it... one minute...
10:41  iaj: looking forward to it mkae :)
10:46  mkae: iaj: i only posted the head of the file: http://pastebin.com/BX3Tmu35 But it contains all you need. 
10:47  mkae: the "recognise keys"-section deals with different keycodes on different mashines.
10:48  mkae: hope that helps...
10:49  iaj: yay, mkae 1000x!!
10:49  iaj: export HOME=${HOME:-/home/mkae}  besides that one... or are you only using $HOME on your main machine
10:51  mkae: this means that HOME is set to /home/mkae if it is not already set. But AFAIK HOME is set by the zsh to your real homedirectory by default
10:51  mkae: I have different usernames on the mashines and HOME is always set correct
10:53  iaj: Ahh okay, good :)

16:11  FabTG: hi everyone, i have tried a tar cjvf test.tar.bz2 $(echo $(find . -name "*test*"))
16:11  FabTG: but if there is a file with space in its name
16:12  FabTG: this raise an error
16:13  FabTG: is there a way to add somme "" to perform the action i'd like?
16:13  thrig: usually one switches to find -print0
16:14  Patplu: FabTG: use tar cjvf test.tar.bz2 **/*test*
16:14  Patplu: instead of find
16:15  FabTG: Patplu: well in fact the exact find command i didn't write uses the -mtime option
16:17  FabTG: so **/*test* is not enough
16:17  Patplu: tar cjvf test.tar.bz2 ${(f)"$(find . -name '*test*')"} 
16:17  Patplu: and you can add your find options
16:18  thrig: and hope there are never enough files to break things
16:21  blueyed: FabTG: you can use something along **/*test*(m-5) to list only the files changed in the last 5 days, too.
16:36  FabTG: blueyed: zsh is wonderful ;)
16:37  FabTG: blueyed: blueyed in wich part of the help files did you find that?
16:38  FabTG: Patplu: what is (f) ?
16:42  Patplu: FabTG: f flag converts the output of find to an array
16:43  FabTG: is this a feature from zsh or from the command find?
16:43  Patplu: it's a zshism
16:45  ft: But just line by line. if a filename contained a newline character, that wouldn't work. I known that's unlikely. I'm just saying.
16:46  Patplu: you're right
16:46  thrig: ... and, again, if there are slightly too many files found. *KABOOM*

18:00  Mikachu: blueyed: sorry, didn't read everything
18:29  yacoob: Hmm.
18:29  yacoob: How do I make a while read ... loop reading from a process substitute?
18:30  yacoob: while read p ...; done <( other; list ) doesn't seem to be working
18:30  thrig: (other; list) | while ...
18:31  yacoob: yeah, that's what I gathered - is there a way to use <(...) here?
18:31  thrig: I fail to see why you would need that
18:32  yacoob: too lazy to move large chunks of command line around :)
18:33  ft: you're almost right. while read line; do print -- --$line--; done < <(echo Hello World;)
18:34  yacoob: ah
18:34  ft: <(...) is something you can read from. but you need to tell the shell to read from it.
18:34  yacoob: yeah - when I did 'echo <(...)' it turned obvious
