06:05  Maahes: what's wrong with this line in my .zshrc? zsh complains about the ) but isn't it properly encapsulated? zstyle ':completion:*:corrections' format "- %d - (errors %e)")"
06:16  teratorn: what is with the extra )" at the end?
06:16  teratorn: Maahes: ?
06:19  Maahes: teratorn: oh, damn, yeah I'm tired
06:29  Maahes: is there any way to get zsh to accomplish what fish does for mount? fish autocompletes whatever's in fstab as arguments for mount. the current zsh setup I have lists hosts and mountpoints (the former works, the latter just shows the folders in my home dir)
07:20  Maahes: would anyone mind taking a look at my .zshrc, and see if you can tell me why my aliases aren't working? I get no error from the .zshrc http://pastebin.com/jiXmMzFh

09:00  Maahes: fow: they don't work. as in: if I do ~>ll I get file or program not found
09:02  fow: where ~> is your prompt? What does type ll say? What does just "alias" output? Are you sure you zshrc is being sourced?
09:05  asyd: hello there, any one ever use zle -C to define a new completion widget?
09:07  asyd: I want to write a funciton which returns elements, and use this function for a script completion. However, I have two questions: how I Know which completion widget I should use in zle _C
09:30  Maahes: fow: yes I'm sure it is sourced because my completion works. ll returns: command not found. alias returns: which-command=whence
09:32  fow: Maahes, apparently those lines in your zshrc aren't being sourced. See if zsh -x outputs any information about why this is

14:34  peth: someone recently mentioned fixing mpc completion on here, but i don't have it in my scrollback any more. i remember mpc play <tab> working, but now i only get track titles w/o numbers, so mpc play doesn't know what to do. is that person here/does anyone have a solution or pointer for me?
14:34  Mikachu: he just posted on the mailing list
14:35  Mikachu: http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2010/msg00835.html
14:35  peth: thanks!
14:35  Mikachu: the doctor saves the day
14:35  asyd: hey Mikachu are you aware about zle -C ? ;p
14:35  Mikachu: asyd: n
14:36  Mikachu: i have some in my zshrc but i think they're all stolen from the mailing list
15:54  cYmen: Suppose I have a folder with music. All the files are labelled "Artist - Album - Track". How do I get a list of the albums I have?
15:54  asyd: \o/
15:56  Mikachu: echo *(e,'REPLY=${${(s:-:)REPLY}[2]')|sort -u
15:56  Mikachu: (didn't try)
15:56  Mikachu: oops, missed the terminating , before the )
15:58  cYmen: It's amazing how each and every time I wonder if you're yanking my chain.
16:00  cYmen: Mikachu: It almost worked.
16:00  cYmen: It output everything in one line though so sort -u didn't do anything. :)
16:01  Mikachu: oh sorry, print -l of course
16:02  cYmen: Wouldn't it be easier to do this with some ## matching or whatever?
16:02  cYmen: I seriously have to look into this syntax you're using all the time. It seems enormously powerful.
16:02  Mikachu: e::?
16:02  Mikachu: it basically lets you do arbitrary code
16:02  cYmen: Yeah. I read up on that once but have already forgotten all about it.
16:03  cYmen: It's sort of an implicit loop, right?
16:03  Mikachu: the downside is that it can get slow for large sets if you have external commands in there
16:03  Mikachu: yeah
16:03  cYmen: A map one might even call it.
16:03  Mikachu: also, if you return false the file isn't inserted in the result, so it has two uses

22:44  glphvgacs_: ok, i can get out of isearch and into vi (not vicmd) by setting bindkey -v 
22:45  glphvgacs_: now bindkey -a (according to man zshall) should do the trick.
22:45  glphvgacs_: but i doesn't 
22:45  glphvgacs_: *it
22:47  glphvgacs_: in fact bindkey -a sets the emacs mode as default when escaping isearch
22:47  Mikachu: are you sure you're not confusing viins with emacs?
22:48  glphvgacs_: i might, in fact you're right. i'm confsuding viin and emacs
22:48  glphvgacs_: but still why binkey -a doesn't work?
22:49  glphvgacs_: Mikachu: you're quite right. first escp i'm in viins and the second one i'm in vicmd.
22:52  glphvgacs_: which kinda makes more sense, since vicmd is only beneficial if i want to scroll back in the history buffer with j k. which shouldn't be needed since i haven't found the command i want with isearch.
