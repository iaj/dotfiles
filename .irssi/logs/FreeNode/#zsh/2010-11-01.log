13:34  yacoob: Aquamacs bundled color-theme. It's easy to use it separately, it's a bit non-trivial to use it in a byte-compiled form :)
13:34  yacoob: ghraaaa. Wrong window.

23:29  efphe_: hello
23:30  efphe_: do you know why if i type ..<TAB> the slash is not added?
23:30  efphe_:  ..<TAB> => ../
23:30  efphe_: that's what I would like to have
23:30  Mikachu: zstyle ':completion:*' special-dirs ..
23:30  Mikachu: add that to your .zshrc
23:30  efphe_: ok
23:30  efphe_: trying
23:31  efphe_: yes! it works
23:31  efphe_: Mikachu, thank you
23:31  Mikachu: yw
23:31  efphe_: Mikachu, let me ask for another question
23:32  efphe_: by typing the beginning of a directory name (inside `pwd`) I can `tab inside it`
23:32  efphe_: however, I noticed that the <TAB> is adding some "global" directoris
23:32  efphe_: also if these dirs are not in `pwd`
23:33  efphe_: do you know what I enabled to do that?
23:33  efphe_: I would like to remove the "global" dir completion
23:34  fow: Why are you quoting "global"? Do you mean cdpath directories?
23:34  efphe_: yes I think yes
23:35  efphe_: I mean TAB pretends to complete dirs name by finding dirs on some global path
