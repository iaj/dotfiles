09:30  frosch: Hi! 
09:33  frosch: I unintentionally deleted my .zshrc on one of my machines two minutes ago. :-( As you might guess: I have no backup of that file.  But I have a shell open in which Zsh has loaded everything from my .zshrc file.  Is it possible to 'restore' my .zshrc configuration out from this shell somehow?
09:50  ft: frosch: zsh ships a script called `reporter', which may be able to help you. It's in the `Util' subdirectory of the distribution.

09:51  ft: it will likely not reproduce everything your setup did, it'll be better than nothing.
09:52  ft: (the top of the script file contains usage information)
09:53  frosch: h thx

22:01  Dynetrekk: hi, I've heard nice things, and I'm thinking of switching bash -> zsh. is there a decent tutorial / comparison you'd recommend?
22:24  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: Check the zsh wiki (/topic) and you can find many zshrc files. The website also has some documentation but it's a little outdated.
22:24  Dynetrekk: thanks. can I reuse / source / ln -s my old .bash_profile files?
22:25  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: It depends. Simple aliases will continue to work, as will functions. But all configuration options are different.
22:25  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: what do you mean by "configuration options"? I think I have mostly exports, aliases and export PATHs
22:26  Dynetrekk: and a function or 3
22:26  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: That should work fine.
22:26  rudi_s: I meant bash configuration settings.
22:26  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: I am not sure if I ever used them?
22:27  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: Hehe, me neither before i switched to zsh. I don't even know how they work in bash, maybe setopt or something like this.
22:27  rudi_s: But in this case you can move everythin to ~/.zshrc.
22:27  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: then only thinkg I can think of, is that I tried to set "vim mode" in bash
22:27  Dynetrekk: was never too happy with that
22:27  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: It works in zsh as well (I really like it, but YMMV).
22:27  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: I'll start out by sourcing the file I tink
22:28  rudi_s: Yeah, just try it, zsh will tell you if something goes wrong.
22:28  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: I'll give the zsh version a go. I _really_ like vim itself, so there's no reason I shouldn't like it!!
22:28  rudi_s: ;-)
22:28  rudi_s: You can even map jj to esc (if you like that) and display current mode in your prompt.
22:28  Mikachu: (note that it is vi mode, not vim mode)
22:28  Dynetrekk: rudi_s: oh, current mode might be nice. even though it would steal a line
22:29  Dynetrekk: Mikachu: right, but it should work like the basic vi editing...
22:30  Dynetrekk: does it make to put simply this into my .zshenv file? ". .bash_profile"
22:30  rudi_s: Dynetrekk: No need for a complete line, it's just a symbol.
22:30  rudi_s: .zshrc
22:30  Mikachu: yeah, but by default it has such annoyances as not letting you backspace past the point you entered insert mode
22:30  Dynetrekk: ah okay...
22:30  Dynetrekk: why not .zshenv? 
22:30  rudi_s: . ~/.bash_profile should work, yes.
22:31  rudi_s: Hm, depends on your settings. PATH and similar ones should go into ~/.zshenv, the settings for interative use into ~/.zshrc
22:31  Mikachu: don't put PATH in .zshenv!
22:32  Dynetrekk: I'm confused :P which one of you is right?
22:32  Dynetrekk: I only had a .bash_profile for bash, and happy with that
22:32  rudi_s: Mikachu: Why not?
22:33  Mikachu: because it will override the environment
22:33  Mikachu: you want to set path once when you log in in .zprofile or something
22:34  rudi_s: Mikachu: Ah, okay. Didn't know that, thanks.
22:34  Dynetrekk: btw, what should I use, zprofile or zshrc?
22:34  Mikachu: zprofile is only used for login shells
22:35  Dynetrekk: so that's the one I want , I suppose
22:37  Mikachu: you want to define aliases and whatnot in .zshrc though, since they don't propagate through the environment
22:38  ft: use zshrc unless you know you want another file. /topic -> wikifaq, question 2 lists all of them.
22:40  Dynetrekk: ft: thanks. sanest advice so far :P I don't understand the wikifaq entirely
23:03  anon33_: could anyone help me zsh'ify this script i'm trying to write? i'm looking to get all symlinks, follow their destination and copy those files
23:04  anon33_: http://pastebin.com/cA9ETjbQ
23:09  Dynetrekk: eh, someone mentioned I could show the vi mode (normal/insert etc)? how do I accomplish this?
23:10  fow: Dynetrekk, Google "ft vi mode zsh"
