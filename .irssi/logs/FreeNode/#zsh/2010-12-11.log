01:09  iaj: hi there - is there any easy way to complete to the most recent file in  a director
01:09  Mikachu: yes
01:10  Mikachu: bindkey something _most_recent_file
01:18  mmc: when doing  "dput" (apt-related) I would like to complete on "*_source.changes" files. How to do it?
01:19  mmc: for now  even *amd64.changes  are offered.
02:00  iaj: Mikachu: thanks
02:02  iaj: just trying something out - can someone tell me what's missing here?  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/303370
02:05  Mikachu: a problem description and expected result
02:08  iaj: well 'ba 1' on command line should switch to a specific folder
02:08 * FauxFaux high-fives Mikachu.
02:08  iaj: 'ba 2' to another.
02:08  Mikachu: and it doesn't?
02:08  iaj: no :(
02:08  Mikachu: right
02:08  Mikachu: it doesn't
02:08  Mikachu: because a script is a separate process
02:08  Mikachu: the current directory is a property of a process
02:08  Mikachu: you can make it an autoloadable function instead
02:09  Mikachu: or just a function in your .zshrc if you don't want to bother with autoloading stuff
02:09  iaj: Mikachu: the problem is I had it as an function in my .zshrc
02:09  iaj: But I wanted it to work in VIM as well... to :!ba 1
02:09  iaj: and thought of a bash script :\
02:09  FauxFaux: Why do I think you can make cd work in scripts?
02:10  Mikachu: iaj: no way to do that
02:10  Mikachu: :! is always a subshell
02:11  Mikachu: FauxFaux: it of course works in the script, but once you exit it is no more
02:11  iaj: Mikachu: ok... got it... then ill just take it to my rc again
02:11  FauxFaux: Indeed.
02:11  iaj: and make a separate thing in VIM

07:58  atpa8a: hello
07:59  atpa8a: on ubuntu whenever i use the history keys (up/down arrows) it puts the cursor at the beginning of the line... how can i change that to the end of the line?
08:06  ft: atpa8a: bindkey -e
08:06  ft: also /topic -> wikifaq
08:07  atpa8a: hmm
08:07  atpa8a: that's emacs bindings
08:07  atpa8a: right?
08:08  atpa8a: i use vi bindings but in most distros if i do up/down arrors the cursor stays at the end of the line
08:08  atpa8a: in ubuntu it jumps in the beginning of the line
08:09  atpa8a: and i would like to correct that
08:13  atpa8a: it's rather annoying

13:32  peth: atpa8a: bind your preferred widgets
18:00  atpa8a: hello
18:00  atpa8a: whenever i use up/down arrows to scroll history ubuntu puts the cursor in the *beginning* of the line
18:01  peth: as ft told you, http://zshwiki.org/home/docs/wikifaq #11
18:02  atpa8a: cool thanks
18:02  atpa8a: must've missed it
18:04  atpa8a: hmm
18:05  atpa8a: the bindkey -M recepie didn't fix it...
18:06  atpa8a: but if i switch to emacs mode it works properly...
18:12  peth: bindkey -M vicmd binds the key for the vicmd keymap, bindkey -v viins for viins
18:13  peth: so, depending on where you want to change the function of your arrows, apply accordingly
18:15  atpa8a: bindkey -v viins "${terminfo[kcuu1]}" up-line-or-history;      ~
18:15  atpa8a: bindkey: even number of arguments required
18:16  atpa8a: hmm
18:16  peth: the ~ stands for the rest?
18:16  atpa8a: nah
18:17  atpa8a: it's just the prompt i use
18:17  peth: ah
18:17  atpa8a: you can ignore it
18:17  peth: will do
18:17  atpa8a: i think i found it in the global zshrc...
18:18  fow: atpa8a, bindkey -M viins
18:20  peth: huh. where did my -v come from.
18:21  atpa8a: "^[[A" vi-up-line-or-history
18:21  atpa8a: "^[[B" vi-down-line-or-history
18:22  peth: atpa8a: did you get that? i erroneously gave you bindkey -v viins, it should be bindkey -M viins
18:23  atpa8a: peth: yes
18:24  atpa8a: hmm
18:24  atpa8a: bb soon
18:32  fove48: hello people
18:34  fove48: My english is not very good, and this is the first time I try to use it :D
18:34  Mikachu: good luck :)
18:35  fove48: (that's why I write slowly) then I have some problems whith .zshrc
18:35  fove48: (for information I speak frensh)
18:35  fove48: tanks Mikachu 
18:36  fove48: this my precmd function http://pastebin.com/2W8GSy5n you can see that I put into i a preexec () function
18:37  fove48: to send title to the window,
18:37  fove48: but when a writhe some name of program in the shell he apeard tree times on the window's title
18:38  fove48: for exemple of window's title I can have "ls desktop ls desktop ls desktop"
18:40  fove48: yet, I have right ls desktop just one time
18:40  fove48: do you have any ideo about this dysfunction, please ?
18:41  Mikachu: you can't put preexec inside precmd
18:41  Mikachu: or at least, it will do weird things
18:43  fove48: ok, I will put I outside precmd,
18:44  fove48: oh great ! that's work !
18:45  fove48: tanks Mikachu 
18:54  fove48: if you allow a have an other problem, whith this part of .zshrc http://pastebin.com/eppKqvHw (it is someting complicated :D). I whoud like to color the username of all users in green, exept root how have to be colored in red. it work when I open a terminal emulator whith a normal user, he correctly colerd he name in red...
18:57  fove48: but when I resiter myself as root, it retains the green of the normal users, and he don't tunrns into red befor I right "source .zshrc
18:57  fove48: "
18:57  Yorokobi: if [[ $UID == 0 ]] ; then PROMPT='root prompt'; else PROMPT='user prompt'
18:58  Mikachu: i think the problem is you have another .zshrc in ~root/ ?
18:58  fove48: yes a have another one in /root
18:59  fove48: but when I modifie ~/.zshrc and I register myself as root, the prompt of root look like what I modifie in ~/.zshrc
19:00  fove48: s/modifie/modified/
19:03  fove48: I am realy mad... when I copi my ~/.zshrc to /root/.zshrc all work correctly
19:04  fove48: It took me one day to note this
19:07  fove48: now I am reely hapy of my .zshrc tank you Mikachu and Yorokobi 
20:06 --- mreng is now known as mren
21:16  atpa8a: hello again
21:19  atpa8a: so... i try that solution from the FAQ and it doesn't solve anything
21:25  atpa8a: hmm
21:25  atpa8a: found one solution :P do bindkey -d before doing bindkey -v
21:26  Mikachu: atpa8a: your problem is that ubuntu explicitly binds vi-up-line-or-history to your up key in /etc/zsh/zshrc, it is not mainline zsh configuration to do that
21:26  atpa8a: Mikachu: yeah... figured that...
21:27  atpa8a: should i just comment those out in /etc/zsh/zshrc?..
21:27  Mikachu: or bindkey -d
21:27  Mikachu: h)
21:27  Mikachu: :)*
21:28  atpa8a: yeah :P
21:28  Mikachu: or setopt noglobalrcs in .zshenv
21:28  atpa8a: hmm
21:29  atpa8a: wondering which one is more portable... i nfs mount that home directory between multiple distros
21:29  Mikachu: both should probably work for this case, the latter is more general
21:29  atpa8a: the setopt one?
21:30  Mikachu: yeah
21:34  atpa8a: cool
21:34  atpa8a: i'll take a note for now...
21:34  atpa8a: don't want to quit the current shell
21:34  atpa8a: bindkey -d works for now
21:34  atpa8a: thank you much
