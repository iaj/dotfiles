14:30  Ceelvain: hi
14:31  Mikachu: hello
14:31  Ceelvain: Is there an option that would make my cursor on the beginning of the line when pressing up or down ?
14:31  Mikachu: yes
14:32  Mikachu: not an option as such, but you can rebind your up/down key to another widget
14:32  Ceelvain: i didn't activated it, but I think this is a new ubuntu default.
14:32  Mikachu: vi-up-line-or-history i think (and -down-)
14:32  Mikachu: if you have it this way now and don't want it, you probably are in vi mode, put bindkey -e in your .zshrc
14:33  Ceelvain: I actually want vi mode.
14:33  Mikachu: bindkey -v then?
14:34  Ceelvain: On my own laptop I activated vi mode, and don't have this issue.
14:35  Ceelvain: and wtf with vi mode ? vim has never behaved like this.
14:37  Mikachu: i don't know what "this issue" and "like this" is
14:38  Ceelvain: putting my cursor in he begining of the line when pressing up or down arrow key.
14:38  Mikachu: do you want it or not want it?
14:38  Ceelvain: I don't want it.
14:39  Mikachu: then bind your up/down keys to up-line-or-history and down-*
14:43  Ceelvain: hum... yes, there's some binding in /etc/zsh/zshrc
14:43  Ceelvain: I think this is the source of the new behavior.
14:45  Mikachu: probably your distributions fault then ;)
14:45  Mikachu: zsh very rarely changes default behaviour in my experience
14:46  Ceelvain: I really really need to delete ubuntu soon.
14:47  Ceelvain: I've neved had so much problems.
14:49  Ceelvain: where do I find things like "kcuu1" for "up" key ?
14:52  efaistos: hey is there a way when you type "ls fo*" to have it extended like this "ls foo football" currently it just takes the first one when you hit [TAB] and cycles on both files ... 
14:54  Mikachu: yes
14:54  Ceelvain: efaistos: it works for me.
14:55  z00d: for me too.
14:55  z00d: efaistos: type <tab>
14:55  efaistos: weird :/
14:55  Mikachu: that part of zsh is infinitely configurable
14:55  Mikachu: if you just want to expand a pattern to all matches, try ^X*
14:55  efaistos: i guess so ... but cant find the right option 
14:55  Mikachu: (not ^X^*)
14:56  efaistos: found it ... had an option i just removed ... 
14:56  efaistos: sorry for the noise :)
14:56  z00d: for info, what's that option ?
14:57  Mikachu: there's at least 2 options, one zstyle, and the fact that you can bind several different widgets to the tab key :)
15:02  efaistos: z00d: I removed the part of my zshrc and cant remember exactly :-(
15:02  efaistos: have to check the man 
15:06  z00d: ok.thx.
15:28  Ceelvain: bindkey "$terminfo[cuu1]" up-line-or-history
15:28  Ceelvain: What's wrong with that ?
15:28  Ceelvain: it doesn't work

21:51  felipec: ft: right, I didn't see that
21:51  Mikachu: ah

23:45  hyperair: hello. is there printf "%'d" equivalent functionality on zsh? it seems present in bash, but not zsh
23:48  thrig: what does printf "%'d" do in bash?
23:52  hyperair: thrig: thousands separator
23:53  hyperair: printf "%'d" 1234 --> 1,234
23:54  Mikachu: does it print 1,2345 in a japanese locale? :P
23:56  thrig: hyperair: seems a GNUism, don't see anything relevant in ZSH or on OpenBSD
23:57  hyperair: Mikachu: i'm not sure, why don't you try?
23:57  Mikachu: hilariously, gnu printf doesn't support it
23:58  Mikachu: it didn't
23:58  hyperair: thrig: interestingly the manpage of zshparams says that it supports it.
23:58  hyperair: sorry i mean it mentions LC_NUMERIC
23:59  hyperair: and thousands separator
