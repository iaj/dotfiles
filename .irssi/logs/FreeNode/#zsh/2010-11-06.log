04:16  Alumin: I think I may have just inadvertently created a zsh convert
04:17  Alumin: I came in here to tell the story because I thought y'all would get a kick out of it
04:19  Alumin: so a friend of mine and I were sitting on the couch discussing some changes I was making to a file in a git project directory
04:19  Alumin: so blah blah blah, type type type, code code code etc
04:20  Alumin: I save the file, go back to the shell, and type "git add <tab>" and (as most of you will already know to expect) zsh automatically completed just the file that had the unstaged changes
04:22  Alumin: and my friend kinda joked "hmm that was a coincidence that it happened to pick that file first, it's nowhere near the first one in alphabetical order"...I wasn't even thinking because I've just gotten so used to zsh's power, so I went "oh uh, yeah it only completes files that have unstaged changes when you hit tab after 'git add'"
04:23  Alumin: his jaw dropped and after about 5 seconds of silence he just said "that is sorcery."
04:26  Alumin: you heard it here first, people...bash is good, but zsh is SORCERY!
