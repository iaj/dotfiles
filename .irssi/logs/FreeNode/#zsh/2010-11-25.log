08:33  Mosu: hey. is there a way to combine emacs-forward-word/emacs-backward-word with bash-style word matching? if i'm at the end of e.g. "something_with_underscores" and press emacs-backward-word i'd like the cursor to be at the "u" of "underscores", not at the "s" (this works nicely with the normal backward-word and "select-word-style bash")
08:41  Mosu: or alternatively make forward-word go to the end of the current word instead of the beginning of the next one

10:31  Dieterbe: Hail_Spacecake: it's with 'set'
10:31  Dieterbe: like 'set <optionname>'
10:31  Dieterbe: or set no<optionname>
10:31  ft: setopt, actually.
10:32  ft: set -o may work too.
10:32  Dieterbe: hmm that's iteresting. i've put just 'set' in my script and it seems to work
10:44  ft: It may seem like it, but I'm fairly sure it doesn't work with just "set". Set has POSIX behaviour, too, which doesn't have a lot to do with options.
10:48  Dieterbe: ah yes, it's set -o
11:08  Dieterbe: meh.  i have a hard time binding home/insert/delete/insert
11:09  Dieterbe: i tried bindkey '\e[1' beginning-of-history
11:09  Dieterbe: "\e[1"
11:09  Dieterbe: and some blog post referred to "${key['Home']}", but $key seems empty for me
11:45  tlonim: Dieterbe: check zkbd zsh module
11:51  Dieterbe: ugh
11:52  Dieterbe: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html no mention of zkbd?
11:53  Dieterbe: no mention in man zshmodules either
11:54  Dieterbe: weird because i do have a file /usr/share/zsh/4.3.10/functions/Misc/zkbd
11:54  ft: it's not a module.
11:54  ft: it's a function.
11:55  ft: man zshcontrib
11:55  Dieterbe: thanks
11:59  Dieterbe: ugh, i am supposed to disable all the keyboard shortcuts in my WM or something before running the zkbd wizard?
11:59  Dieterbe: i mean it asks me to type alt-x which is bound in my WM
12:00  Dieterbe: i hope it's only *-x, i can disable 1 binding for now..
12:14  Dieterbe: allright.
12:14  Dieterbe: works nicely
12:14  Dieterbe: thanks
13:54  iaj: can I have a whole folders symlinks replaced with its originals?
13:54  Dieterbe: yes, you can easily script that
13:54  iaj: really?
13:54  iaj: how would that look like :)
13:56  Dieterbe: for i in *; do check if symlink, get location, rm link, mv location $i; done
13:56  iaj: oh, ok.. so now I would only need to know the explicit commands :)
13:56  iaj: thanks!
13:59  tlonim: iaj: use readlink for link stuff
14:55  cYmen: bapt: How is your irc stuff coming?
15:19  bapt: cYmen: too much work to code it currently :)
15:40  netron: Hello! When i hit "mplayer <tab>" it shows stuff like "gopher://" "vcd://" and so on. How to disable that? I only want the completion of files for mplayer
15:43  cYmen: netron: Hm..it would probably be easiest do define your own completion instead of changing the existing stuff.
15:43  netron: but i like all that other mplayer completion stuff of parameters and settings
15:44  cYmen: Well, edit the file then and make it work. :)
15:44  cYmen: should be in /usr/share/zsh/$version/functions or something
15:45  cYmen: called _mplayer
15:45  cYmen: There is a compadd -S line that you could just try removing but I have never written any completion files so I don't know if that will work. ;)
15:45  netron: yes, i found it. but before i use my try&error method of editing this file, i asked here :)
15:46  cYmen: Yeah, I don't know either.
15:46  ft: zstyle ':completion:*:*:mplayer:*' tag-order files
15:46  ft: or something like that.
15:46  cYmen: Explanation? :)
15:47  ft: look at the tag-order style documentation in zshcompsys(1).
15:47  cYmen: Oh, yeah I used that for ssh.
15:48  cYmen: w4m
15:49  netron: ah, i managed to comment out the two lines in the file to achieve it :)
15:51  netron: next question: is it possible to run this guided setup again you get when a new user starts zsh for the first time?
15:51  AB3JU: netron: or you could just use that zstyle one-liner :P
15:51  AB3JU: that way it doesn't get overwritten when you upgrade
15:52  netron: does not work :/
15:53  AB3JU: works fine for me
15:55  netron: ah, okay. thought that command writes something to the config. It does work fine, sorry
15:55  netron: will add that to my config then
