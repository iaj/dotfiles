16:31  Jafet: That's the terminal's job, not zsh's.
16:32  ezzieyguywuf: hrm, or tmux's
16:32  Mikachu: Jafet: no it's not
16:32  Jafet: But I don't know any terminal that does it.
16:33  Jafet: Well, zsh can scroll just the prompt horizontally
16:33  Jafet: In theory, that is
16:33  ezzieyguywuf: Jafet: that's what I'm asking for
16:33  ezzieyguywuf: I want it to still wrap output
16:34  Mikachu: scrolling horizontally seems less useful
16:34  ezzieyguywuf: for the prompt? not to me.
16:35  ft: there are quite some shells that do that, actually.
16:35  ft: I think I've seen bash do it.
16:35  ft: And I know, mksh does it by default.
16:36  ft: Never wanted it, though. So I don't know how to make zsh do it.
16:37  Jafet: What, there's no keypress-at-the-prompt hook?!
16:37  ezzieyguywuf: well, at least I know its possible, which technically is what I was asking :-P
16:38  Mikachu: Jafet: what would you want to do at every keypress?
16:39  Jafet: If out of space, scroll the prompt manually with hardcoded ansi sequences or something

17:35  jackinloadup: hey guys, quick question. How can I change my starting directory
17:36  Mikachu: change it before starting zsh
17:37  mutable: Hello. When I set option HIST_IGNORE_SPACE, the last command beginning with space still shows in history unless I type another command. Is there any workaround?
17:38  jackinloadup: @Mikachu I use zsh as my staring shell so I can't do it before, unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean
17:40  Jafet: Change it in your zprofile
17:42  jackinloadup: Jafet:  I will try that
17:42  mutable: oh, I've just read description of that option, so it's intentonal, please don't reply to me
17:47  jackinloadup: Jafet: thanks that did solve my problem
17:47  Jafet: I suspect changing your starting directory is a good way to make yourself new problems
17:49  jackinloadup: Jafet: do you think it might not read your home settings?
17:49  jackinloadup: i simply placed 'cd /www/
17:50  jackinloadup: in to that file and it worked and my preferences are all still good even in vim. i will keep an eye out though
17:50  Jafet: I don't know. If rm -r or something gets run in the wrong directory for whatever reason, that's your worry
17:51  jackinloadup: eek ok
17:54  jackinloadup: another question i have is that when i log in to my server with ssh the zsh prompt colors and styling go away. I am using Phil!'s ZSH prompt (http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/)
17:55  ianp: $TERM 
17:56  Jafet: Phil wrote that prompt rather nicely. It checks terminfo for colours and styling characters, and only uses them if they're there. Only if they're there.
17:56  jackinloadup: xterm-color just like my desktop
17:56  jackinloadup: the profiles are the same... in fact they i versioned them in git so my prefs were the same
17:57  jackinloadup: ah i see
17:58  jackinloadup: so i should dig through that profile and his if statements 
18:26  naeg: hello
18:27  naeg: may someone please help me with a completion script? I get "_arguments:comparguments:312: invalid argument:" when trying to complete in some cases
18:27  naeg: http://pastebin.com/StY3EYe8
18:28  naeg: it's for packer, a pacman wrapper for AUR (Arch Linux)

18:47  d-rock: I've tried setting up some custom hooks: http://pastebin.com/PVeGFUQt but no love
18:47  peth: d-rock: you can bind those widgets yourself. look for vi-backward-blank-word in zshzle
18:47  peth: or similar
18:48 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 115 seconds
18:49  d-rock: Ah
18:49  d-rock: Thanks
18:49  d-rock: I've been reading through the zsh manual but it's a bit, well, large :P
18:49  peth: isn't it :D
18:50  d-rock: Can I bind that widget directly? As in, bindkey "^w" vi-backward-blank-word ?
18:50  peth: should work, yes
18:50  d-rock: Cool, let me try that out
18:54  d-rock: Hmmm
18:54  d-rock: OK, that moves me back to the character after the blank, but I'm looking for a kill
18:55  d-rock: Let me dig in the bindings page in the manual
18:56  peth: it's all in there. and if you need more than all, you can write your widgets ;)
18:56  peth: *your own
18:56  d-rock: Yeah
18:56  d-rock: I tried, but it didn't seem to care about me using a local WORDCHARS
18:57  d-rock: Check my pastebin
18:57  HandyGandy: Looking for one-liner: looking for all the files in a directory that are owned by me and want to chown  X.Y .
18:58  Jafet: find(1)
18:59  thrig: ... or get funky with ZSH extended globs `man zshiforgetwhat`
19:00  Jafet: Yeah, sorry, that should have been implied by asking the question here
19:00  peth: d-rock: you're inverting the meaning of WORDCHARS. it isn't NONWORDCHARS.
19:00  d-rock: Argh
19:00  d-rock: OK
19:00  d-rock: I've read examples that set WORDCHARS to things like "*?_-[]~=&;!#$%^(){}<>"
19:00  d-rock: Which makes it look like that's where I should be putting it
19:01  Jafet: You were probably reading perl golfers' rc files
19:01  d-rock: Hmmm. Nope, that doesn't have any effect
19:02  d-rock: And, FWIW, "echo $WORDCHARS" gives me a blank line
19:02  d-rock: there isn't a NONWORDCHARS set in my normal env
19:04  d-rock: I'm just confusing myself :(
19:06  peth: d-rock: does "autoload -U select-word-style; select-word-style bash" do anything for you?
19:06  d-rock: Let me try
19:06  d-rock: That should go in my RC, right?
19:06  peth: can try it from cmdline first
19:07  d-rock: Nope
19:07  d-rock: If I type "ls -la /home/software", and then hit Ctl-W, it only deletes to the "/" after home
19:08  d-rock: In bash, it deletes to the space after "-la"
19:08  peth: ok, you could add / to you WORDCHARS if that's what you want.
19:08  thrig: or set select-word-style bash or something
19:08  peth: uh
19:09  d-rock: Yeah, that didn't work.
19:09  d-rock: Let me try adding "/" to WORDCHARS
19:10  d-rock: Bingo
19:11  peth: weird that select-word-style didn't work, but hey
19:11  peth: maybe some ohmy weirdness
19:11  d-rock: Very likely
19:11  d-rock: Well
19:11  d-rock: Hmmm
19:11  d-rock: Darnit
19:12  d-rock: Still won't work on quoted paths :(
19:12  d-rock: I'm going to have to dig around a bit
19:13  Mikachu: select-word-style s should fix that
19:15  d-rock: Should fix quoting? It doesn't :(
19:15  blueyed: There was some widget to edit an environment variable using the $EDITOR or zle IIRC. How's that called/triggered by default? (I want to edit LS_COLORS)
19:17  d-rock: Sorry, I just tested again with bash and inside a quoted string it only deletes to whitespace
19:17  d-rock: So that is the same
19:17  d-rock: Actually, looking at select-word-style, I should be able to use "whitespace" for what I want
19:17  Mikachu: /foo/bar\ baz/wamm and ^w here deletes wamm, then bar\ baz/ and then foo/ for me
19:17  d-rock: Mikachu: yeah, what I want with ^W is delete to whitespace
19:18  d-rock: I can delete to delimiter with alt-backspace
19:18  Mikachu: seems weird to treat '\ ' specially
19:18  Mikachu: of course unquoted whitespace is not skipped for me
19:18  peth: blueyed: vared edits in zle
19:18  d-rock: Yeah, I had that wrong, bash doesn't do it either for quoted whitespace
19:20  blueyed: peth: thanks
19:20  blueyed: d-rock: "select-word-style shell" might do that, see "man zshall"
19:21  d-rock: I tried that and it didn't
19:21  d-rock: But that's OK
19:21  d-rock: I was imagining something I never had in Bash, either ;)
19:22 --- mren|off is now known as mren
19:23  Mikachu: http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/fae5a25bb9efacb6c21573828d89a71c.txt is how it behaves for me
19:25  peth: however did you manage that? it stops at "\ " for me too
19:25  blueyed: d-rock: it works for me.. ctrl-w on 'echo 1\ 2_' deletes the whole argument, when using "autoload -U select-word-style; select-word-style shell"
19:25  d-rock: For me: http://pastebin.com/VJrtjRci
19:26  d-rock: I would love a hybrid of the two
19:27  peth: oh, never mind. it does for me too when i bindkey -e
19:27  d-rock: I want ^W to delete back to the last unquoted space
19:27  Mikachu: then don't change WORDCHARS and use select-word-style shell
19:27  d-rock: Yeah, that doesn't work
19:28  Mikachu: it really should
19:28  Mikachu: what's your ^w bound to?
19:28  d-rock: I believe you, really :)
19:28  d-rock: Here's what I'm working on: http://pastebin.com/2JxSQshA
19:29  d-rock: I would like "normal" word select most of the time
19:29  Mikachu: err
19:29  Mikachu: you're using .backward-kill-word so you're overriding the functions that select-word-style sets up
19:30  d-rock: But ^W I want to delete all the way back to the last unquoted space
19:30  Mikachu: maybe
19:30  d-rock: OK
19:30  d-rock: I'm a total newb with zsh, so this probably isn't the only thing I'm screwing royally ;)
19:30  Mikachu: well, just remove the dots
19:30  d-rock: OK
19:30  Mikachu: or add -match
19:31  d-rock: I'll take any recommendations for streamlining this
19:31  Mikachu: no that wouldn't work, they're functions, not widgets
19:31  Mikachu: just remove the dots :P
19:31  d-rock: OK
19:31  d-rock: Let me remove the dots
19:32  d-rock: AWESOME
19:36  d-rock: Well, one very minor issue. The "bash" word style doesn't seem to want to delete quoted spaces now
19:36  d-rock: Everything else works great
19:36  Mikachu: dunno about that, never used bash :P
19:37  d-rock: Yeah, not a huge deal
19:37  d-rock: The main thing was being able to move and kill space-delimited
19:38  d-rock: Thanks so much!
19:38  Mikachu: yw
20:00  ezzieyguywuf: I'm using zsh in vi mode. earlier today, someone helped me set it up such that it defaults to command-mode and forces me to enter insert mode. At first I liked it, but not so much. What I realyl want is for it to go ahead and default to insert mode, but if I Esc into command-mode, I want it to stay there until I re-enter insert mode. Once I'm in insert mode, it should once again stay there until I Esc back out to command mode. any idea how I ca
21:37  anon33_: how do i set grep to be have the -inr option included each time it's run? something like -setopt but I don't quite remember...
21:47  rudi_s: anon33_: alias? alias grep='grep -inr'
