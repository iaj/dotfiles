14:37  anon33_: is there a way to pipe anything that outputs more than screen length to a pager (LESS) without having to append | less?
14:56  csgeek: I'm trying to make a really simple alias.. that basically when I type    myCD <dir>  it actually does a cd $dir/$dir-ext   I was trying to use $0 or $1 but I don't think that's right.  Any suggestions?
15:17  Mikachu: csgeek: you want a function
15:20  csgeek: Mikachu: thanks.. that did it.
