01:18  thrig: ezzieyguywuf: or you could just put . in the path, but that's usually a horrible idea
01:20  ezzieyguywuf: thrig: hrm, never thought about that. but it does sound like a bad idea.
01:20  ezzieyguywuf: but essentially it is what I want.
01:20  ezzieyguywuf: maybe I should rethink this :-p
01:31  teratorn_: ezzieyguywuf: just type ./<TAB>
01:31  teratorn_: it isn't that difficult :)

06:33  aefjt: Hi. Is it possible to run a function to generate the shell prompt?
06:35  aefjt: (Run for every prompt; not just once)
06:35  Nomexous: Yes.
06:36  Nomexous: precmd()
06:36  Nomexous: For more info search for "precmd" in zshmisc(1).
06:37  aefjt: Oh, I seem to have confused precmd with preexec.
06:40  aefjt: How does precmd interact with PROMPT, though? (And the environmental PS1)
06:40  aefjt: I'm looking at a script whch defines both, and I'm not sure how to follow it
06:41  Nomexous: You'll need to do all the PROMPT manipulation in precmd yourself.
06:41  Nomexous: And PROMPT == PS1.
06:41  Nomexous: They're aliased to each other.
06:44  aefjt: I see, so precmd should update PROMPT (or PS1).
06:44  aefjt: Thanks.

09:48  iaj: hm how could I find out what $1 $@ do refer to? trying to look into zshexpn - parameter expansion but that's only covering variables, no/
09:50  fow: iaj, man zshall | less -p 'POSITIONAL PARAMETERS'
09:51  iaj: hmm why isn't that in zshexpn :<  thanks fow!

11:34  ft: deitarion: thanks, removed ti.
11:34  ft: it even.
11:56  deitarion: Is there a way to get arrow-key navigation in completion similar to what Vim's wildmenu option offers?
11:56  ft: yes.
11:57  ft: try the completion setup in /topic -> wiki -> compsys quickstart
11:57  ft: http://zshwiki.org/home/examples/compquickstart
11:59  deitarion: Doesn't seem to differ from what I've already got. I don't want just tab cycling. I also want to be able to use the arrow keys to navigate the filesystem. (Left/Right to cycle through completions, Up/Down to Ascend/Descend)
12:00  deitarion: ...though, given what the page says, I suspect that may be something to do with my keybindings.
12:01 * deitarion goes to try to re-discover the flag to launch a new zsh without sourcing rcfiles.
12:02  Jafet: There is a "real-menu" option, which I can probably only ever find again if I run the newuser script again
12:03  Jafet: Sounds inferior to just typing the next character, though
12:03  deitarion: Jafet: I have a lot of files which can't be typed on my keyboard. (eg. Japanese songs with Kanji filenames)
12:05  deitarion: (X11 blows up if you try to enable too many different types of enhanced input at once. I'm still trying to figure out why my switch to LXDE messed up having RightCtrl = Compose, level3_shift = RightAlt, and the remaps for my G1-G15 keys active at the same time.
12:05  deitarion: )
12:05  Jafet: I tend to tab and use the cut buffer for that
12:06  deitarion: I don't know a way to do that simply and comfortably.
12:06  iaj: whats if [ -z "$1" ] doing?
12:07  Jafet: .oO( write your own tab completion that can translate from romaji )
12:08  deitarion: Jafet: Too much work and it's bad enough that Vim and my non-console apps often have conflicting keybindings to work into my muscle memory somehow.
12:08  deitarion: Besides, I don't READ Kanji, so having Romanji-to-Kanji completion would be useless.
12:09 * Mikachu already has a script like that for irssi
12:10  Mikachu: 凄いでしょう
12:10  deitarion: As silly as it sounds, I tend to keep track of my Japanese-titled files by a mixture of line length, vague "pattern of squiggles" familiarity recognition, and something sort of analogous to how, if you stare at a block of text long enough, your brain starts to find significance in the patterns made by the density and alignments of spaces between words.
12:11  Jafet: Learning languages by osmosis is common enough
12:11  deitarion: ...though, primarily, I just remember files by things like the pattern of alternations between Kanji and Kana.
12:12  Jafet: I rename my foreign language music to include a transliteration, and some LTR marks where necessary (some programs really mess up bidi text)
12:13  deitarion: Jafet: I plan to (maybe), but I have higher-priority things to do first.

14:00  yacoob: Jafet, why not simply romanize the filenames?
14:00 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 204 seconds
14:02  Jafet: Usual romanization procedures are highly non-invertible for some languages.
14:02  Jafet: I don't know about japanese, but mandarin is a prime example.
14:02  yacoob: why would you care, if it's only the filenames?
14:02  Jafet: Because zsh can't tab-complete on vorbis tags yet.
14:02  yacoob: it's the content that matters, right? The filenames act as keys to the data, so it'd make sense to make them parsable by the user...
14:03  Jafet: Filenames are data. Or do you still use an ms-dos file system?
14:05  yacoob: Jafet, in the context of "bunch of files with song lyrics", the filenames are just keys to the data
14:05  yacoob: if you know the song/album name, you most likely know how to pronounce it -> faster to find romaji filename
14:05  yacoob: if it's kanji, it's harder
14:05  yacoob: or am I missing anything here? :)
14:08  Jafet: The filenames also contain data. I arbitrarily decide to preserve the data.
14:08  yacoob: your call :)
14:09  Jafet: I rarely address individual music files in zsh, anyway; recurse indiscriminately and -print0 anything of interest
14:11  Mikachu: what are you doing with find when you have zsh??
14:12  Jafet: Listing files in a directory subtree matching some criteria??
14:14  Mikachu: i see!!
