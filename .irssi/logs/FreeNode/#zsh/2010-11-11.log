11:03  zaarg: how do i turn off this infuriating spell check in zsh?
11:03  zaarg: the did i mean? prompt
11:05  ft: turn off the correct and correctall options.
11:05  ft: or rather, don't turn in *on* in the 1st place.
11:05  ft: that option is not on per default.
11:06  zaarg: it's on by default in debian seemingly?
11:06  zaarg: i tried going through the config a few times but haven't managed to disable it completely
11:08  ft: no, debian doesn't enable it either. (at least not last time I checked)
11:09  zaarg: ah, well maybe oh-my-zsh does somewhere...
11:09  zaarg: thanks anyway
11:11  Mikachu: what a surprise
11:11  zaarg: i grepped for correct and sorted out the offending line and now all is good and right
11:11  ft: right, maybe it's the 5 lines from debian. *or* the gazillion of lines with obscure settings from that oh my thing. :)
12:13  tlonim: how to disable zsh mail checking ?
12:14  tlonim: export MAILCHECK=0 ?
12:18  Mikachu: it's off by default
12:23  tlonim: Mikachu: hmm.. i am getting "You have new mail"  from few days at login 
12:23  Mikachu: echo $options[mailwarning]
12:24  tlonim: off
12:24  tlonim: why is there a mailwarn and a mailwarning 
12:25  Mikachu: it's the same option
12:25  Mikachu: well, in that case you probably have a check in the login script i guess?
12:27  tlonim: yeah.. will check login script.
13:05  jensnorr: Is it possible to make zsh stop offering corrections again and again? I run into this mainly with git. Like git push mybranch, and it wants to correct "mybranch"
13:08  ft: jensnorr: are you using ohmyzsh by any chance?
13:08  jensnorr: ft: yes
13:08  ft: heh. :)
13:08  ft: setopt nocorrect nocorrectall
13:09  jensnorr: ft: Will that turn of correction altogheter?
13:09  ft: yes.
13:09  ft: setopt nocorrectall
13:09  ft: if you like command name correction.
13:10  jensnorr: ft: Ok. Thanks... I'm quite new to zsh. Is this something in ohmyzsh or in standard zsh?
13:11  ft: jensnorr: it's a zsh feature that's disabled by default.
13:11  ft: that ohmy thing just turns it on.
13:12  jensnorr: ft: Another question... Autocompletion with directory names... Is it possible to make it suggest only directories that are relevant?
13:12  ft: (and people come here to complain - which I don't blame you guys for. I blame the oh my people for using such weird settings.)
13:12  jensnorr: ft: Ok thanks!
13:12  ft: jensnorr: what's a "relevant directory" to you?
13:13  jensnorr: ft: For instance. if i type "cd n<tab>" it will suggest "nobody" but there isn't a "nobody" directory there
13:13  ft: heh.
13:13  ft: Stop using oh-my-zsh. :-)
13:13  ft: setopt nocdablevars
13:14  jensnorr: ft: :-) That thought has occured to me...
13:15  ft: we wanted to start a `#burntbyohmyzsh' channel at one point. :)
13:16  jensnorr: ft: Thanks! I don't understand why one would like it to suggest changing directory to something thats not in the path
13:16  ft: well, there is the $cdpath parameter for that purpose entirely. :)
13:16  ft: but I don't use it either.
15:41  csgeek: probably a silly question.. but how do I make it so my prompt is broken up into multiple lines.  I just want something like \n to be interpreted 
15:41  Mikachu: PS1="
15:41  Mikachu: "
15:42  ft: or PS1="foo"$'\n'"bar"
15:42  Mikachu: or () { local n=$'\n'; PS1="foo${n}bar" }
15:44  estragib: i tried to do write a wrapper that sends a bell when a command has finished (so my term can set the urgency hint). i tried the following, but it fails on shell constructs etc: function _notify { local cmd=$1; shift; $==cmd $==~*; echo \\a; }; alias notify="noglob _notify" # what's the Right Way to do this?
15:46  Mikachu: um
15:46  tlonim: what is $== btw 
15:46  tlonim: is it a special variable
15:47  Mikachu: why do you want to write the echo on the start of the line instead of at the end?
15:47  Mikachu: whatever; echo \\a
15:48  estragib: oh god. i'll brb after shooting myself in the foot some more. thanks, mikachu.
15:49  csgeek: thanks all
15:50  Mikachu: ft: did you see nikolai started poking at _git?
15:52  ft: Mikachu: um, nothing concrete. just a notice of intent, IIRC.
16:11  estragib: tlonim: sorry, was called for lunch. afaict, the == turns off word splitting. i don't even know if it makes sense here as i clumsily "adapted" the func from ft's extglob precommand
16:12  ft: my what? :)
16:13  estragib: you did a precommand alias to temporarily turn on extglobbing somewhere. at least i think it was you :)
16:15  estragib: oh no, that was bart schaefer
