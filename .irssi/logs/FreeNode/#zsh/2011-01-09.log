18:52  nicoulaj: In a completion function, is it possible to use _values together with _path_files ? I have an option that takes a comma separated list of paths as value
18:52  nicoulaj: I can't find any example of this
19:42  AopicieR: hi; when I do a "su foouser" or log in remotely via ssh, zsh will change the title of my xterm to "user@host: directory" which is nice; when I log out again the title will however stay like that; any hints on how I can have the title reset when logging out?
20:11  peth: zsh doesn't do that by itself afaik. it must be in the configuration of the user you're su'ing to. you can either reset the xterm title in their .zlogout, set an own in your precmd/preexec, or remove the xterm title setting from their conf.
20:16  peth: AopicieR: ^^
20:18  AopicieR: oh, you are so right, I only now realize that it only happens when the user I'm su'ing or ssh'ing to uses the bash and yeah, there in the .bashrc I find the corresponding lines
20:18  AopicieR: I always thought is was some fault of the ZSH to not reset the title
20:19  AopicieR: thanks for the response and sorry for bothering
20:19  peth: no problem at all
