06:26  bunder: any idea why /etc/zsh/zprofile wouldn't be read?
06:27  bunder: permissions look fine, but nothing in there gets run when i run zsh
07:00  iaj: when I got a symlink.. how can I easily navigate to its folder?
07:02  Mikachu: it's a symlink to a file?
07:02  Mikachu: if you have a recent zsh you can cd thesymlink(:A:h)
07:11  iaj: Mikachu: yeah that does the job! thanks!

09:13  skavez: hello -- is there on option that makes zsh check $PATH for new scripts/binaries? sometimes i'll write a new script for ~/bin, but then I'll need to do `eval zsh` to update $PATH.

09:16  teratorn: skavez: rehash
09:30  skavez: teratorn: thanks -- found <http://zshwiki.org/home/examples/compsys/general> (last FAQ) and it seems to work well
10:04  tlonim: how do i combine file pattern matching and sort specifier --  *.pdf(/On[1]) doesnt work..
10:22  Mikachu: you have a pdf file that's a directory/
10:41  Mikachu: tlonim: ^
10:42  tlonim: Mikachu: yeah..saw that ..works now
10:43  Mikachu: okay
10:50  tlonim: how do i get glob expansion in variable assignment ? 
10:50  tlonim: ex: x=*eng*  
10:51  tlonim: currently i do x=$(print ...) 
10:52  Mikachu: x=( *eng* )
10:53  tlonim: without array assignment it wont work ? i also tried *eng*.(srt|sub)(om[1]) since it is single element
11:00  Mikachu: there's an option for it, but generally you want to use an array
11:01  ft: doesn't the option create arrays, too?
11:01  Mikachu: glob_assign, but i don't recommend it
11:01  Mikachu: % test=cit*
11:01  Mikachu: % echo ${(t)test}
11:01  Mikachu: scalar
11:01  Mikachu: % echo $test
11:01  Mikachu: citat
11:02  ft: if there are multiple hits, you end up with a scalar, too?
11:02  Mikachu: no, then it's an array
11:02  Mikachu: but that is probably even more useless, because then you can't just do [1] to get the first file... because if it's a scalar you just get the first character
11:02  ft: okay, thanks. Must have misremembered it, then.
11:03  Mikachu: well, you could check (t) but talk about roundabout

13:07  Mikachu: frigg, another redraw bug with wide chars...
13:27  ft: Mikachu: wide chars, as in "more than one byte" or wide, as in "more than one character cell in a terminal"?
13:27  Mikachu: the latter
13:28  Mikachu: it happens when you enter five or more doublewidth characters, go back to the start of the line, enter singlewidth characters until the line is full (just before it wraps)
13:28  Mikachu: instead of nothing happening, the whole line is cleared
13:28  Mikachu: BUT
13:28  Mikachu: this only happens if TERM=rxvt-unicode
13:28  Mikachu: BUT
13:28  Mikachu: it doesn't matter if you're using xterm or urxvt
13:30  Mikachu: the funny thing is i just opened a terminal and did just that, thinking "i wonder if this will break something"
13:34  m314: Hi, when I type 'git [tab]' to get completions, I get "fatal: error processing config file(s)" but zsh otherwise completes as it should. Any idea what could be causing this?
13:36  XTaran: m314: .gitconfig may be broken
13:36  ft: yes.
13:36  ft: since git completion calls git, you get...
13:36  ft: too slow.
13:36  XTaran: ft: :)
13:37 * XTaran had that case just recently. A twice defined alias in .gitconfig caused that. :)
13:39  m314: Oh, cool :)
13:39  m314: Thanks guys!
13:42  Tasser: XTaran, hehe ;-)
14:11  iaj: where can I get help on for loops and [[ ]] conditionals?
14:18  blueyed_: iaj: try "man test" for "[["
14:18  blueyed_: also "man zshall" should have everything.. ;)
14:18 --- blueyed_ is now known as blueyed
14:20  ft: I doubt "man test" will say much about `[['. Since test is really `['.
14:25  iaj: `expression` is the same as $(expression) correct?
14:25  ft: not really the *same*.
14:26  ft: but very very similar.
14:26  iaj: shall I stick to `` or $()?
14:26  ft: personally, I prefer $(). Unless I know a script is going to run in a non-POSIX bourne shell. Like /bin/sh on opensolaris.

14:34  blueyed: is there something like "last x chars" of a string? (I am using ${var:e} now for the extension, but wondered). $var[-3,-1] ?!
14:34  Mikachu: yes
14:59  variable: is there some way for me to get the equivalent of renice -n 10 %% ?
14:59  variable: ie - the last background task get's reniced?
15:03  Mikachu: any reason you can't just use nice in the first place? :)
15:04  Mikachu: otherwise, $! is the last backgrounded job

15:13  Mikachu: renice -n 10 ${${jobstates[%%]##*:}%%\=*}
15:13  Mikachu: the %% inside the [] is the job specification

19:36  sanmarcos: echo "asdasd !"
19:36  sanmarcos: dquote?
19:37  sanmarcos: how can I stop that, I always want a literal !
19:37  ft: do you use banghist at all?
19:37  sanmarcos: how do I check?
19:37  ft: if you need to check, you probably don't. :)
19:37  ft: setopt nobanghist
19:38  sanmarcos: but I do want to do !!
19:38  sanmarcos: to execute previousc ommands
19:38  ft: then, it's more complicated.
19:38  ft: echo 'foo !'
19:39  ft: is your weapon of choice then.
19:41  sanmarcos: ok
19:41  sanmarcos: bash supports "foo !"
19:41  sanmarcos: actually it does not
19:41  sanmarcos: I am using ZSH because I want an updated shell but OS X wont update bash anymore because of the GPLv3
19:42  ft: Even if it did, it's a completely different shell and bang hist is not a POSIX feature. so, basically, both shells may do whatever they'd like wrt banghist. :)
19:44  yuki_satoshi: I have a quick question: what is zsh doing when I try to use (1,2)(3,4) as the argument to a program and it says "no matches found"?
19:45  ft: it tried to find a file in the current directory, which matches that glob. :)
19:46  yuki_satoshi: I would ask what that glob expands to, but I'm already struggling a regexp in Perl just to process that argument, so I think I better not :D
19:48  ft: It would match a file called "1,23,4".
19:48  ft: () does grouping. But there's only one element in each group.
19:49  ft: you could do (1|2)(3|4) to match 13, 14, 23 or 24.
19:49  yuki_satoshi: Oh, I see
19:50  ft: beware, () at the end can do *lot's* of other stuff.
19:51  ft: *.foo(.) for example would match all *regular* *files* matching *.foo.
19:51  ft: Not directories, sockets, fifos or other types of files.
19:51  ft: (all of this is zsh specific).
19:52  yuki_satoshi: Cool
19:52  yuki_satoshi: I can easily see how I'd need such a feature and never find out about that lol
19:52  ft: (and might depend on the `extended_glob' option being set - I forgot where it starts)
