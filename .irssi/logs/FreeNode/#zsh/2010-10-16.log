11:50 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 70 seconds
12:53  sanjoyd: ZSH does not seem to source ~/.zshrc when loaded using tmux. Any clues what might be wrong / what I should check up?
12:54  Mikachu: sure it's starting zsh? ;)
12:54  sanjoyd: Yup. In fact, I checked, /etc/zsh/zshrc is being sourced.
12:55  sanjoyd: My current hack is to manually source ~/.zshrc from /etc/zsh/zshrc; which is quite ugly.
13:00  estragib: sanjoyd: i've had similar issues with guake and screen. you could make sure the shell started is explititly a login shell
13:00  Mikachu: .zshrc is always sourced, login shell only affects whether .zprofile is sourced
13:02  sanjoyd: This is actually quite absurd. I've not had this issue with screen. Let's see what the guys at #tmux have to say.
13:02  estragib: in which case i'll be ashamed in that corner over there
13:03  Mikachu: .zshrc isn't sourced if the shell isn't interactive
13:23  ft: sanjoyd: print $ZSH_VERSION
13:24  mika: sanjoyd: does set  -g default-command "exec /bin/zsh" inside .tmux.conf help?
13:24  sanjoyd: ft: 4.3.10.
13:24  sanjoyd: mika: let me check.
13:24  ft: (that requires the tmux server to be restarted, fwiw)
13:25  ft: (and since sanjoyd said his /etc/zsh/zshrc *is* sourced, I doubt it'll help.)
13:25  ft: sanjoyd: what OS/Vendor?
13:25  mika: oh right, wrong assumption from me, i just though of the lack of invocation of zsh when using vzctl enter $OPENVZ_CONTAINER
13:26  sanjoyd: ft: Debian, unstable.
13:26  ft: sanjoyd: could you use the zsh-beta package instead?
13:26  ft: (that one has the source_trace option)
13:27  Mikachu: you can emulate sourcetrace with some grepping
13:27  ft: but it's so much easier. :)
13:27  ft: esp when you don't know all the places in which to grep. :)
13:28  Mikachu: zsh -lo xtrace |& grep -a '^+' | cut -f1 -d: | sort -u
13:28  ft: huh. clever. :)
13:28  Mikachu: you need to 'exit' too
13:29  mika: Mikachu: nice
13:29  ft: I still need to push the few features I'm responsible for. :)
13:29  ft: Don't obsolete me!11! :-)
13:29  Mikachu: hehe
13:30  Mikachu: sourcetrace is probably better than that hack
13:30  ft: phew. :)
15:00  dropdrive: sanjoyd: Did you figure out your tmux/zsh problem?
16:09  iaj: hi there.
16:09  iaj: is there someway to complete to a -1 directory?
16:10  Mikachu: ~-1
16:16  iaj: Mikachu: thanks
