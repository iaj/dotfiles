01:39  mqt: how do I bind control+/ with bindkey?
01:41  Valodim: mqt: bindkey ctrl+/ action
01:42  fow: control+/ sends ^_ here, so...
01:43  mqt: bindkey '^/' doesn't work
01:43  mqt: neither does ^_
01:44  mqt: apparently it doesn't send anything

09:22  frosch: Hi, I'm using Gnome Terminal and zsh and zsh behaves like setopt vi is set (but according to my .zshrc it isn't) 
09:23  frosch: if I'm firing up xterm then zsh behaves as expected
09:23  frosch: Has somebody here ever heard of something like this?
09:28  fow: frosch, zsh looks at EDITOR and VISUAL to see if either start with "vi". If either does, then zsh uses vi keybindings. Just add bindkey -e to your zshrc and all will be well
09:29  frosch: Is it possible to configure zsh so that it opens text files (source files) with vim without typing vim filename? For example right now it automatically opens less if I type in /usr/share/python/debian_defaults.
09:29  frosch: fow: thanks! that explains everything
09:29  fow: you're welcome
10:06  peth: fow: nit: it's enough if vi is in there somewhere, doesn't need to start with it
10:06  fow: oh
10:06  peth: VISUAL=emacs-vi will give you vi keys
10:28  Arrowmaster: just override it with bindkey -e
10:28  ft: yep, but it's documented like that, too, IIRC.
10:31  peth: yrc
12:39  vincent_wang: does anyone know how to disable the terminal title in zsh ? 
12:41  Arrowmaster: xterm title? zsh doesnt do that on its own, you must have something in your startup scripts that does it

15:10  asyd: :)
15:10  KU0N: and you?
15:10  asyd: it's supposed to be the same.. but..
15:11  KU0N: to get user input, and letting the user use line editing (arrows...), bash has read -e, but can't find how to have this to work under zsh.

21:41  belak: How can I fix my keys, Home, Delete, End and the like in zsh?
21:41  belak: Right now they just insert a ~
21:46  cirwin: http://zshwiki.org/home/zle/bindkeys
21:46  belak: Thank-you
21:48  belak: How come ${terminfo[khome]}
21:48  belak: doesn't contain anything?
21:49  cirwin: no idea â€” you can find out what the escape sequence for the key actually is by using ctrl+v <key>
21:50  cirwin: for me ctrl+v <home> prints out ^[OH
21:51  belak: For me it's ^[[7~
21:51  belak: I'd rather not set them manually.. :/
21:52  belak: Ah
21:52  belak: Wrong terminfo

22:08 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 82 seconds
22:09  belak: Ah
22:10  belak: It's strange but it works without the (V)
22:10  Mikachu: ?
22:10  Mikachu: what works?
22:10  belak: The example
22:10  Mikachu: i have no idea what the example is
22:10  belak: http://zshwiki.org/home/zle/bindkeys
22:10  belak: Under reading terminfo[]
22:11  Mikachu: it's only a problem when you want to print it to the terminal
22:11  belak: Ah, because it uses the actual binding? The (V) is essentially a ^V for the variable?
22:12  Mikachu: (V) just makes unprintable chars printable
22:12  belak: Ah, ok
22:12  Mikachu: bindkey can handle both raw keys and ascii mangled representations
22:12  Mikachu: it would be pretty hard to use it if you had to give it raw escape bytes
22:14  belak: Thanks
22:14  Mikachu: np

22:22  fow: belak, zstyle ':completion:*:*:sudo:*' command-path ...
22:24  belak: Does that replace the command path, or just add to it?
22:24  fow: I believe it replaces it
22:24  Mikachu: you can use zstyle -e :whatever: 'shell code here'
22:24  fow: I use this http://dpaste.com/327051/
22:24  Mikachu: for example, '$path /sbin /usr/sbin', would be relevant here
22:25  fow: that...is a lot simpler than mine
22:25  cirwin: how do I find out what state the completion is in when I've typed "git commit --fixup="?
22:25  Mikachu: haven't tested, but i imagine it would work
22:25  Mikachu: i don't have sudo myself
22:25  Mikachu: cirwin: _complete_help
22:26  belak: Nice
22:26  belak: I just su'd to root and copied the path
22:26  cirwin: thank you Mikachu :)
22:28  cirwin: it still doesn't have enough information for me to customize the completion just then though

23:56  cirwin: I'd guess you can just pipe it? ssh user@site.org 'mysqldump  -u user --password="secret" mybd' | mysql  
23:57  thrig: or first write it to a file, confirm mysqldump didn't exit strange or something, perhaps any verifications steps, then have some other process act on the file as necessary
23:59  aleray: I tried to pipe it to mysql but it didn't seemed to work
