09:58  henrikbjorn: how do you make light colors ?
10:16  henrikbjorn: okay vcs_info absolutely rocks but how do i get it to auto update my prompt when cd'ing directories ?
10:18  Valodim: it's usually called in pre_cmd
10:23  henrikbjorn: function pre_cmd() vcs_info 'prompt'  ?
10:23  henrikbjorn: is there anything i need to enable or something like it ?
11:08  ft: precmd, no _.
11:10  ft: henrikbjorn: <http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=zsh/zsh;a=blob_plain;f=Misc/vcs_info-examples;h=bc10a2179ff64b04a4f02539691b7f63065e9b9e;hb=HEAD>
11:11  henrikbjorn: dosent work
11:12  ft: yeah. I can't work with such a description. at all.
11:19  henrikbjorn: i added the precmd function to my zshrc and restarted my terminal
11:19  henrikbjorn: and cd to a git repository
11:19  asyd: hmm, is there an equivalent to pattern{n,m} in zsh expansion?
11:19  henrikbjorn: and it dosent show the information but if i source zshrc in the git dir it does subst the vcs info
11:20  asyd: guess I want to match 4 chars, do I need to use "????"
11:22  ft: asyd: yes, you can. but there's {n,m} type of match in recent versions, too. But I forgot what it was.
11:23  ft: henrikbjorn: look at the link I gave you.
11:23  asyd: "yes, you can" can use ???? or specify a number in a different way than {n,m} ? ;p
11:24  ft: if you know it's four, ???? works.
11:25  asyd: yeah ok. But I need to match 32 ;p
11:25  ft: asyd: man zshexpn | less -p cN,M
11:26  asyd: hmm
11:27  asyd: pff
11:27  asyd: var=toto ; echo ${var%?(#c2)}
11:27  asyd: thanks
13:38  silver_hook: I'm trying to make my own prompt, but the online documentation seems to give too little information, while reading packaged prompts it looks quite complicated :\
13:38  silver_hook: ...is there an useful HOWTO somewhere?
13:41  silver_hook: I'll try this for now: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/
13:41  silver_hook: But I'm open to any suggestions ...
13:44  derdon: where is the directory stack located? in a file?
13:45  asyd: in $dirstack
13:46  derdon: asyd: hm. how can I reset it?
13:47  asyd: dunno
13:47  derdon: k
13:47  asyd: since it's seem to read only
13:47  asyd: restart a new zsh session? :P
13:48  derdon: asyd: thanks :D
13:56  silver_hook: OK, noob question: I'm RTFM-ing and searching the web and it seems making your own prompt can take quite a few lines of code. Can I do that outside '~/.zshrc' and import that file or is there a better way?
13:57  silver_hook: Same question for custom auto-completions and environment scripts.
13:58  asyd: source <file>
14:00  silver_hook: asyd: Are there any conventions on how to name or store them?
14:00  asyd: I don't think so. I know "lot" of people use .zsh/<file> 
14:01  asyd: in my case, all my zsh files are in .zsh, even zshrc, where ~/.zshrc is a symlink to ~/.zsh/zshrc
14:01  silver_hook: Hey, that's an idea! :D
14:01  silver_hook: Thanks! :D
14:01  asyd: this way you can easily have the whole .zsh in a SCM
14:01  silver_hook: Was wondering about that as well.
14:01  silver_hook: Although I don't know who'd be intereted in reading my Zsh settings :P
14:02  silver_hook: But for personal use, it's an awesome idea!
14:09  iaj: is there any difference whether to use PS1= or PROMPT= ?
14:10  unmatrix: hi - is there a way to define a shortcut which write "for x in | ; do | ; done" to the command-line and set the curser to "|" and after another shortcut move the cursor to the 2. "|" ?
14:15  silver_hook: iaj: Just wanted to ask the same but according to 'man zshparm' they're the same and $PROMPT2 equals $PS1, and so on.
14:25  silver_hook: asyd: You do the same for '~/.zlogin' etc.?
14:26  iaj: silver_hook: thanks man
14:27  silver_hook: iaj: Sure! Read that manpage to see what PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 do â€” I'll try to pimp them all out :3
14:38  iaj: silver_hook: haha.. :-)
14:38  iaj: did you get the git_ and hg prompt info running?
14:40  derdon: I did not :(
14:40  derdon: so I will write my own solution and learn some things at the same time :)
14:42  ft: derdon: <http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=zsh/zsh;a=blob_plain;f=Misc/vcs_info-examples;h=bc10a2179ff64b04a4f02539691b7f63065e9b9e;hb=HEAD>
14:43  ft: Not that I want to keep you from writing your own, but - trust me - it takes a shit load of time to come up with something decent. :)
14:43  derdon: ft: I should read the end of it, right?
14:44  ft: actually, the beginning.
14:44  derdon: oh
14:44  ft: better yet, all of it. :)
14:44  derdon: ft: but the beginning will probably not help me
14:44  derdon: ft: do you know my problem?
14:44  ft: vcs_info is also fully documented including a quick start guide in zshcontrib(1).
14:44  ft: derdon: no. :)
14:45  derdon: ft: FAIL
14:45  ft: derdon: I just read git and hg prompt info and ran with it. :)
14:45  derdon: ft: the function file cannot be found here although I've got 4.3.10 installed yesterday
14:46  ft: derdon: that's odd. what OS/vendor?
14:46  derdon: ft: Mac OS 10.5
14:47  derdon: I installed it via homebrew, an inoffical package manager for mac
14:47  ft: ls -la ${^fpath}/vcs_info(N)
14:49  derdon: ft: doesn't output anything useful
14:49  ft: derdon: print -l $fpath
14:49  ft: paste that somewhere.
14:50  derdon: /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
14:50  derdon: /usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions
14:50  ft: with 4.3.10 installed?
14:50  ft: doesn't that strike you as odd?
14:50  derdon: uhm, I see :S
14:50  ft: do you set that variable somewhere in your setup?
14:51  derdon: no
14:51  derdon: Mac OS has zsh installed per default. but the version number 4.3.4 was too old for me, so I installed a newer one
14:51  derdon: and now it's time for cleaning up. thanks for your help ft!
14:52  ft: print $ZSH_VERSION
14:52  derdon: 4.3.4 :/
14:52  ft: your terminal starts the wrong zsh binary, I suppose.
14:52  derdon: zsh --version
14:52  derdon: zsh 4.3.10 (i386-apple-darwin9.8.0)
14:53  derdon: I think setting PATH wasn't enough
14:53  ft: print =zsh
14:53  derdon: /usr/local/bin/zsh
14:53  ft: point your terminal to that binary.
14:53  derdon: the system zsh (the older one) is in /bin/zsh
14:54  derdon: ah!
14:54  derdon: got it
14:54  ft: MAC people around? :-)
14:54  derdon: \o/
14:55 * derdon dances
14:55  derdon: ft: vcs_info works now =)
14:56  ft: heh, good good. :)
14:59  silver_hook: iaj: The Git bit half-way, I'm still struggling with basics. It's my first major Zsh pimping.
15:43  derdon: aaargh, don't colorful prompt :o
15:43  derdon: *don't get
16:10  derdon: PS1="%~%(1v.%F{green}%1v%f.)%# "
16:10  derdon: how can I make the "%~" appear in magenta?
16:10  derdon: I don't understand the way of coloring there. (copied from a website)
16:12  ft: %F{magenta}%~%f
16:14  derdon: ft: thanks!
16:38  derdon: [[ `whoami` == 'root' ]] && print '#' || print '%'
16:38  derdon: this works fine
16:38  derdon: print [[ `whoami` == 'root' ]] && '#' || '%'
16:38  derdon: but this does not. error message: "zsh: = not found"
16:39  ft: that's not how shells work. :-)
16:39  derdon: neither does this: foo=[[ `whoami` == 'root' ]] && '#' || '%'
16:39  derdon: with the same error message
16:40  derdon: how can I assign the value '#' or '%' respectively to a variable?
16:41  Mikachu: foo=${(%):-%#}
16:41  derdon: ugh, this looks rather obfuscated to me!
16:42  derdon: like a creative emoticon
16:43  derdon: Mikachu: may you explain it, please?
16:43  Mikachu: hehe
16:43  Mikachu: (%) means to expand prompt sequences
16:43  Mikachu: :- means to use a literal text for the expansion, not the name of a parameter
16:43  Mikachu: %# is the prompt code for a % or # if you're user or root
16:44  derdon: thank you, now I understand it. :)
16:45  Mikachu: as for your question, if you want to assign the output of a command, you need to use $(command)
16:45  derdon: or the backticks
16:45  Mikachu: so it would be foo=$( [[ `whoami` == root ]] && echo '#' || echo '%' )
16:45  Mikachu: yeah they don't nest and you already used those :)
16:45  derdon: right
16:46  ft: but they do nest. you just need to be carefully quoting them accordingly.
16:46  Mikachu: they don't directly nest
16:46  ft: I agree that $(...) is much more pleasant, though.
