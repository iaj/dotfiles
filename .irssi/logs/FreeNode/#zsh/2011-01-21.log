20:12  Cadynum: hey, im wondering if there is a way to have a global zsh config file. i tried /etc/zshrc but it didnt do anything
20:13  ft: strings =zsh | grep zshrc
20:13  thrig: man zshall -> STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES -> first paragraph
20:14  Cadynum: ah, /etc/zsh/zshrc
20:14  Cadynum: i did consult man
20:14  Cadynum: it said /etc/zshrc
20:14  thrig: smack whoever didn't fix the documentation when they mess with the path
20:14  thrig: (or send a patch, or bug report, or flowers)
20:15  Cadynum: since this is the internet i think some good smacking would be appropriate
20:15  Cadynum: /etc/zsh/zshrc did work
20:16  Cadynum: though it still wants me to touch .zshrc to get rid of that message :/
20:16  ft: yes, yes it wants.
20:17  Cadynum: is there some clean way to disable it?
20:17  Cadynum: while not creating the file
20:18  ft: you'd have to disable the zsh/newuser module.
20:22  Cadynum: ft, can that be done without recompiling?
20:25  ft: remove the module from your module path.
20:27  Cadynum: thanks!
20:28  Cadynum: i actually have another, unrelated problem: i would like to disable PATH cache
20:29  Cadynum: if i put a new file in PATH zsh doesnt complete for it
20:29  ft: hash -r
20:29  Cadynum: i have to use rehash first which is a bit annoying

21:48  TheBrayn: hi
22:07  Tuju: how can i find 0xc3 from files with zsh/grep in shell? 
22:28  ianp: dont think that's a zsh question
22:29  ianp: did you try \xC3  or something like that
22:29  ianp: you could also just open in emacs hex editor
22:30  ianp: or use "od"
22:35  Tuju: well, i found the problem thou
22:36  Tuju: it was weird..... running make over nfs caused python to complain for such character.
22:36  Tuju: when i run it on server, everything is fine.
22:37  Tuju: gotta go now, thanks 
22:52  ianp: np
22:57  TheBrayn: how can I move or copy every file in a folder but one?
22:58  thrig: grep -v and suitable shell code or a suitable glob that excludes that one file
22:58  TheBrayn: hm ok
22:59  Mikachu: TheBrayn: cp ^thefile /somewhere
23:02  TheBrayn: ok thats even better :)
23:18  ianp: what's ^thefile mean
