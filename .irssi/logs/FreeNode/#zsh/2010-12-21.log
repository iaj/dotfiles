11:06  Dynetrekk: this disables ctrl-r recursive history search, which is a horrible thing to lose
11:07  ft: it doesn't. unless you're setting `zle_ins_more_like_emacs' to "no".
11:07  Dynetrekk: ft: oh really? because ctrl-r doesn't give me anything right now.
11:08  Dynetrekk: I have zle_ins_more_like_emacs='yes'
11:08  ft: that's because you don't have zrcbindkey, which is a wrapper function around bindkey from my setup. it's in there only by accident.
11:08  ft: give me a minute, I'll fix it up.
11:09  Dynetrekk: ok, thanks :-) it's looking sweet otherwise, although it iwll take some getting used to

12:51  ft: Dynetrekk: does that 2nd paste work for you?
13:20  Dynetrekk: ft: let me check, I was off to lunch...
13:24  Dynetrekk: ft:  seems to be OK so far - I only tested it on something really simple
13:25  ft: good good.

15:54  imc: Pistos: looks like regexp to me
15:55  imc:  more likely '.*\.(ext1|ext2|ext3)'
15:58  Dynetrekk: when I type things like ls *.png and <tab>, zsh inserts the actual filenames. very annoying when you have 100+ files! how do you turn this off, and make it work like bash's defaults?
15:59  imc: Dynetrekk: `ls *.png [tab]` does it?
15:59  imc: (i.e. space after *.png and only then tab)
16:00  Dynetrekk: imc: do you want me to run that in zsh and see what happens? if I type that, thats what happens
16:00  Dynetrekk: with the space, of course not
16:00  Dynetrekk: (I think that's an 'of course'?)
16:01  imc: i don't know... i borrowed this config and modified slightly, i'm far away from being a zsh expert
16:01  imc: just discovered one thing:
16:01  Dynetrekk: ok, no problem
16:01  imc: ls *TAB-ESC-u
16:01  imc: (in vi-mode)
16:01  imc: esc -> command mode, u -> undo
16:01  imc: and it's back to '*'
16:02  imc: :)
16:02  Dynetrekk: haha, great.. vi ftw :P
16:02  imc: eheh
16:34  variable: is there an easy way of creating a long repeating string similar to perl's X operator ?
16:36  variable: meh jot -b a -s '' # works 
16:39  imc: variable: repeat $n; command
16:39  imc: probably something better exists
16:41  variable: repeat 20; echo -n foo works
17:01  Mikachu: ${(l:3*5::foo:):-}
18:11  unixnuub: hmm, strange problem, i'm looking to do something a little similar to lisp's macros 
18:11  unixnuub: ie prevent expansion of a term until execution 
18:12  unixnuub: alias howmanybits="noglob if [[ $( sed -n '/flags/{/lm/q0};$q1' /proc/cpuinfo ) -eq 0 ]] ; then echo '64' ; else ; echo '32' ; fi"
18:12  unixnuub: but check this out ... 
18:12  unixnuub: which howmanybits 
18:12  unixnuub: howmanybits: aliased to noglob if [[  -eq 0 ]] ; then echo '64' ; else ; echo '32' ; fi
18:13  unixnuub: anyway apart from writing it as a function to stop that from being expanded? 
18:14  Mikachu: can you say what it is meant to actually do?
18:14  Mikachu: unixnuub: oh i see, you failed to quote it properly
18:14  Mikachu: $ still expands inside double quotes, use single quotes
18:20  thrig: or you could do less in the alias, more in a standalone testable script
18:24  unixnuub: yep, putting it in a function is easy but I'm trying to make really short one liners for my local Linux group.
18:25  unixnuub: no matter what I do I can't seem to get the quoting correct 
18:25  unixnuub: so it is a good learning experience
18:31  unixnuub: if [[ $(sed -n '/flags/{/lm/q0};$q1' /proc/cpuinfo) -eq 0 ]] ; then echo 64; else echo 32; fi 
18:31  unixnuub: that works absolutely fine 
18:31  unixnuub: it's just getting it into an alias
18:32  unixnuub: I was thinking I could do something like this alias howmanybits=`if [[ $(sed -n '/flags/{/lm/q0};$q1' /proc/cpuinfo) -eq 0 ]] ; then echo 64; else echo 32; fi` or something and have it evaluated just once but no luck
18:38  Mikachu: echo ${${"$(</proc/cpuinfo)":s/* lm */64/}:gs/#%(^(64))/32}
18:39  Mikachu: isn't that a lot more fun?
18:39  Mikachu: (the g isn't needed)
18:40  mika: :)

20:06  webflo: whats the best way to split an string into array?
20:07  Mikachu: array=( ${(s,:,)string} )
20:07  Mikachu: : being the separator
20:07  webflo: ok. i have new line
20:07  webflo: its \n ?
20:07  Mikachu: ${(f)string} then
20:07  Mikachu: (f) is shorthand for (ps:\n:)
20:13  webflo: thank you. whats the good guide to start with zsh scripting? never coded sh/bash or other shell stuff
20:13  Mikachu: no idea, i haven't started with zsh scripting in a long time :P
20:15  fow: I think I started with the little scripting guide on linuxcommand.org. It's bash centric, but the basic ideas do apply to zsh. I think I also perused the bash scripting guides from TLDP
