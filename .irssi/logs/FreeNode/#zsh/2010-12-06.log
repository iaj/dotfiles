00:11  qotsa: Is there a standard way to determine if I logged in via SSH or if I'm working locally? E.g. to use different prompt for remote and local hosts.
00:11  Mikachu: check $SSH_ something
00:13  qotsa: oh, how did I overlook that. thanks.

03:04  anon33_: i'd like to set a wildcard to ignore all those prefixes with 1, so in my case, files that have <song name>\ 1.mp3
03:04  anon33_: is there a way to do that? such as {-1} or something?
03:09  peth: ~ with setopt extended_glob
03:09  peth: as in ls *~1*
03:18  anon33_: I kinda feel like aliasing rm to mv ~/.local/share/Trash ... dumb?
03:21  peth: dangerous
03:21  peth: it will form your habit and make you second-guess
03:21  anon33_: Yeah, but the lack of undo for rm freaks me out a bit.
03:22  peth: you'll eventually rely on it when it's not there and start wondering if it's there every time you do rm. :)
03:23  peth: treat rm with respect is the way i chose after mulling over this
03:23  peth: same with mv
03:23  anon33_: i wish there was a way to make a pop up message after using rm
03:23  anon33_: mv isn't as permanent as rm since it still exists
03:24  peth: but you'll easily overwrite what was there before
03:28  peth: you can always use -i to make sure

16:42  danielsh: running '. .zshrc' yields '.: no such file or directory: .zshrc'
16:42  danielsh: but 'source .zshrc' works fine, as does '. ./.zshrc'
16:43  danielsh: can I make '. .zshrc' source that file?
16:43  Mikachu: alias .=source
16:44  Mikachu: or add . to $path, but that is highly unrecommended
16:44  Mikachu:        source file [ arg ... ]
16:44  Mikachu:               Same  as `.', except that the current directory is always searched and
16:44  Mikachu:               is always searched first, before directories in $path.
16:44  Mikachu: loading a file from the current dir is pretty much the only purpose source has for existing
16:46  danielsh: I'll use the alias
16:46 * danielsh (I assumed there was an option I could set, but...)
16:46  danielsh: Mikachu: thanks :)
16:47  Mikachu: why not just use source?
16:47  Mikachu: note that you can setopt pathdirs to make . ./.zshrc not work ;)
16:48  danielsh: because it's more typing
16:48  danielsh: here . ./.zshrc works even with pathdirs set
16:48 * danielsh (and I don't have . in $PATH)
16:49  Mikachu: ah, Commands explicitly beginning with `/', `./' or `../'  are  not  subject to the path search.
16:49  Mikachu: it just affects stuff like foo/.zshrc, which is usually started from ./

21:15  SolarisBoy: im thinking my zle is not loading properly as the return from 'zle` is 1.. however not sure why its not able to load not getting errors, anyone familiar with this enabling zle?
21:16  teratorn: SolarisBoy: that's normal
21:16  SolarisBoy: o =) cool
21:16  teratorn: SolarisBoy: just typing 'zle' doesn't actually do anything
21:17  teratorn: so the 1 is presumably to let you know that you are an idiot
21:17  SolarisBoy: oh
21:19  Mikachu: teratorn: you almost made me choke on my tea
21:19  Mikachu: i was drinking water though, not tea
21:21  SolarisBoy: i guess i misread the man page =(
21:21  SolarisBoy: 'With no options and no arguments, only the return status will be set.  It is zero if ZLE is currently active and widgets could be invoked  using  this  builtin command  and  non-zero otherwise.  Note that even if non-zero status is returned, zle may still be active as part of the completion system; this does not allow direct calls to ZLE widgets.'
21:21  SolarisBoy: reason i did zle no args =>
21:21  Mikachu: SolarisBoy: that's for when running it in a widget i guess
21:22  Mikachu: so a function can know if it's being called interactively or from a widget
21:22  SolarisBoy: k
21:22  Mikachu: so you can do if zle; then widget stuff; else other stuff; fi
21:22  SolarisBoy: got it
21:35 --- sjl_ is now known as sjl
21:57 * SolarisBoy has question about zshcalsys
22:00  SolarisBoy: actually is it possible someone let me know what keys this function is bound to? "^[[F" end-of-line
22:01  thrig: probably "end" (run `cat -v` and then fiddle with the arrow and similar keys until you find it)
22:02  SolarisBoy: thanks
22:03  SolarisBoy: oh wow cool
22:03  SolarisBoy: thanks thrig

23:33  blueyed: I want to make a not-in-array lookup.. is this the way to do it? "if ! $array[(r)$key] ; then"
23:36  Mikachu: no
23:37  Mikachu: 'if' takes a command, a variable isn't a command (usually)
23:39 --- sjl_ is now known as sjl
23:47  blueyed: ok, what about "if [[ $array[(r)$key] != "" ]]" then?
23:48  Mikachu: it might work
23:48  blueyed: yes, but it feels rather long.. I've thought there must be some shorter way to do this.
23:49  Mikachu: (( $array[(I)$key] )) is slightly shorter?
23:49  blueyed: yes. something like that, thanks.
