17:49  djweezy_: hi, for f in *.TiVo; do tivodecode -m 5599689987 -o ./done/$f.mpeg $f; done when i run that the tivodecode program tells me there is a probablem with the input
17:49  djweezy_: can i not use $f multiple times in the command?
17:49 --- djweezy_ is now known as djweezy
17:50  fow: djweezy, you can
17:50  djweezy: fow: any idea why that command wouldnt be working then? it wants the output then input filenames
17:51  fow: no idea
17:52  ft: well, what problem does it tell you there is?
17:53  djweezy: The file names specified for the output file or the tivo file may be -, which
17:53  djweezy: means stdout or stdin respectively
17:55  ft: That's the error message you're getting!?
17:57  djweezy: yeah
17:57  djweezy: i think i see the problem
17:57  djweezy: the filesnames have spaces in them
17:57  djweezy: thats the error i get when the filesnames arent properly excaped
17:57  ft: shouldn't be an issue in zsh, unless you're setting the sh_word_split option.
17:58  ft: by escaped, you mean quoted, right?
17:58  djweezy: or with \
17:58  ft: [[ -o sh_word_split ]] && echo yay || echo nay
17:59  djweezy: nay
17:59  ft: and you're running that stuff from the command line?
17:59  djweezy: correct
18:00  ft: and you're 100% sure that's the correct way to call tivodecode?
18:00  djweezy: tivodecode -m 5599689987 -o done/America\'s\ Test\ Kitchen\ From\ Cook\'s\ Illustrated\ -\ roasted\ turkey\ and\ pumpkin\ pie.mpeg America\'s\ Test\ Kitchen\ From\ Cook\'s\ Illustrated\ -\ roasted\ turkey\ and\ pumpkin\ pie.TiVo
18:00  djweezy: works fine
18:01  ft: is tivodecode pissed when an outfile is called *.TiVo.mpeg?
18:01  djweezy: i'll check in a second but i doubt it
18:02  ft: set -x; for f in *.TiVo; do : -m 5599689987 -o ./done/$f.mpeg $f; done; set +x
18:02  ft: run that and pastebin the output somewhere.
18:04  djweezy: http://paste.weezy.us/p/684
18:06  ft: are you sure that's zsh?
18:06  djweezy: you mean am i in a zsh prompt?
18:06  ft: ...well, it must be if the [[ -o ... ]] above worked.
18:06  ft: yes.
18:06  ft: print $ZSH_VERSION
18:07  djweezy: uh oh
18:07  djweezy: i think im in bash
18:07  ft: heh. :)
18:07  ft: "./done/$f.mpeg" "$f"
18:07  ft: then
18:08  djweezy: wow
18:08  djweezy: i feel like an idiot
18:09  fow: Apparently [[ -o ... ]] does the same in bash as in zsh, but bash doesn't say anything for a non-existant option
18:09  djweezy: my command from when i first came in here works fine now that in zsh
18:09  djweezy: rtorrent@thor ~ $ chsh 
18:09  djweezy: Changing the login shell for rtorrent
18:09  djweezy: Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default Login Shell [/bin/zsh]:
18:09  djweezy: weird
18:10  ft: yeah, that's why fow couldn't find a problem with that command. :)
18:10  djweezy: maybe this is a really old screen session before i upgraded this server to zsh

23:08  checkers: hey, whenever I run 'sudo -s', once I exit the session I can't go back into the history of the elevated session, because I don't use share_hist (and dont want to)
23:09 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 89 seconds
23:09  checkers: what I was thinking of doing was aliasing sudo so that the histfile changes, and then after the sudo command completes, loading that new histfile into my current history and the main histfile
23:09  checkers: but since sudo cleans your environment I can't pass through a different HISTFILE var
23:10  thrig: or just not export the history settings, and then using custom history settings for the user being sudo'ed to
23:10  checkers: anyone have an idea about how to Do What I Want?
23:10  checkers: you mean putting in place a root .zshrc?
23:10  thrig: in which case you might also want 'sudo -H -s' or appropriate sudoers configuration
23:11  checkers: I don't want to modify the files outside my own HOME, these are multiuser systems
23:12  checkers: I gues instead of using an environment variable I could use a file
23:13  checkers: if I create .hist.$$ before executing sudo, I can check for that in my zshrc (using the ppid) and write history to it if it exists
23:13  checkers: after sudo executes I can `fc -RI .hist.$$ ; fc -WI` or something
23:15 --- mren is now known as mren|off
23:18  thrig: seems complicated and troublesome if a networked home directory were involved
23:25  checkers: luckily not, but all you need to do then is include the hostname too, right?
23:28  checkers: hmm, the only problem with 'fc -R' to read the temporary history file is that the files are not interleaved in chronological order
23:29  checkers: eg, I use inc_hist_append, so if I have another shell open while the first is doing stuff in sudo -s, when I update my main history file it's not in strict chronological order
23:58  checkers: hmm, doesn't seem to work as I hoped
