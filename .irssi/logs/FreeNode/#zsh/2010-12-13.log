08:51  hpt: how to let zsh running like bash wit 'set -x'?
08:54  kenyon: hpt: set -x works with zsh too
08:56  hpt: kenyon: but it confuses me. how to make it shows more clearly?
08:56  hpt: kenyon: I mean the outputs confuse me ...
08:56  kenyon: I don't know that there is a solution to that, other than try to understand it.
08:57  kenyon: it is debugging output, after all.

10:03  teratorn: hpt: k, and it returns 0 when not run in a pipe?
10:04  hpt: teratorn: I am going to use 'tail -n10' in place of 'head -n10'
10:04  hpt: teratorn: yes, pipe broken, 128+13
10:58  david00: Hi all, after a recent upgrade of my local system I get the error "/etc/zsh/zshrc:12: unknown parameter: terminfo" when I ssh into my server that runs ubuntu lucid.
10:58  david00: Various things are broken there such as completion, ^L to clear, etc.
10:59  ft: TERM empty? or set to `dumb'?
11:00  david00: ft: I thought the problem might be TERM.  It's set to 'rxvt-unicode-256color'
11:00  david00: I use urxvt locally and it was probably upgraded
11:01  david00: Not sure what it was using before, but xterm works so that seems to confirm it
11:01  ft: does "infocmp rxvt-unicode-256color" return something sensible?
11:03  david00: infocmp: couldn't open terminfo file /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode-256color.
11:03  david00: That's pretty definitive then... now how to get this definition on my ubuntu servers?  :/
11:03  ft: *shrug*
11:04  ft: #ubuntu? :)
11:04  david00: cheers ft :)
11:22  bmaland: i'm trying to loop over the lines in a file with "for i in `cat tmp`", but it doesnt work with spaces in filenames. suggestions?
11:23  ft: while IFS= read -r line; do ...; done < file.txt
11:25  bmaland: it works, thanks a lot

16:16  bas: hey folks, why is it that i get a 'no such file or directory /home/bas/bla' if i run: ssh root@foobar 'echo $(cat $HOME/bla)' ?
16:16  dropdrive: So I use Alt-. to scroll through the last arg of previous commands.  Is there a way to scroll through the second-to-last arg?
16:17  dropdrive: bas: Because $HOME is substituted at the very beginning, maybe.
16:17  Mikachu: dropdrive: yes
16:17  Mikachu: autoload -U copy-earlier-word
16:17  Mikachu: zle -N copy-earlier-word
16:17  Mikachu: bindkey "^[,"  copy-earlier-word #autoloaded
16:17  Mikachu: for example
16:17  Mikachu: (you don't need the comment)
16:20  dropdrive: Mikachu: Awesome, thanks!
16:21  Mikachu: actually
16:21  Mikachu: you can use alt-2 alt-. to get the second last too
16:25  fow: bas, /p
16:25  fow: er
16:26  fow: bas, I don't have any problems doing similar commands (though the single quotes are important)
16:28  bas: hmm that's funny, maybe it's a setting i'm using. i'll play around a bit. thx anyway
