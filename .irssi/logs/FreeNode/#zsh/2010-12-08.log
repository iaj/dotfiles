00:39  spicey: Being a fan of cdpath, i decided that don't like it messing with "cd", so i make a cdd function, essentially CDPATH=... cd $1. sadly this way I lose all the tab-completion, and it gets much too cumbersome to use. Is there a reasonable way to cast some cd-autocompletion-magic to it without too much hassle?
00:53  rew_: hi, how do i exclude a pattern when globbing? i'd like to do smth like "ls **/^(INCOMPLETE)*.mp3(.)", matching all mp3 files without "INCOMPLETE" in their filename.
00:53  rew_: and my example doesn't work, btw
00:55  peth: rew_: ls **/*.mp3(.)~*INCOMPLETE* should work with extglob set
00:55  peth: that's patternyouwant~patternyoudontwant
00:56  peth: and you probably don't need the (.) when you have .mp3 in your pattern already
00:57  rew_: uhm, thank you, but it gives me "zsh: no matches found: **/*.mp3(.)~*INCOMPLETE*"
00:58  rew_: extendenglob is set
00:58  peth: oh, the (.) doesn't work there
00:58  peth: append it
01:02  rew_: mmh, it seems to work, but doesn't...  *trying*
01:03  rew_: it does :) i got confused. thank you! :)
01:03  peth: yw :)
01:05  Mikachu: glob qualifiers always go at the end
01:05  Mikachu: x~y(.)
01:14  rew_: is there an more elegant way doing smth like "if [[ -f **/*.mp3~*INCOMPLETE*(.) ]]; then ls **/*.mp3~*INCOMPLETE*(.); fi"? i just don't want zsh to complain/stop if there is no match.
01:16  rew_: it tried "{} always { ls **/*.mp3~*INCOMPLETE*(.) }", but it doesn't work and it gives me the feeling that i don't really know what i'm doing.
01:16  thrig: rew_: setopt NULL_GLOB or N to set that option specific to the pattern
01:18  rew_: wow, thats dangerous, thank you, i didn't know nullglob.
01:19  Mikachu: by or N he means do *(.N) in your pattern
01:19  Mikachu: note though that ls with no arguments will list the current directory
01:23  rew_: thank you guys, very interesting

02:00  rew_: uhm, well, bad habit, i guess. in this case it'll run as a cronjob and i don't want to send it's err output to 2>/dev/null because it could silence something important, maybe. and i don't want cron to mail me when there were no files. i'm not really a programmer, so i guess it's just bad habit (and me, not really knowing what i do)

02:55  checkers: except on some systems that file is in vim71, or 70, or in /usr/local/share
02:56  checkers: how can I specify a list of locations to check for the file's existence, and use the first one as the target for the alias?
02:57 --- Channel #zsh was synced in 120 seconds
03:04  thrig: checkers: I'd probably use a symlink as appropriate on each different platform
03:07  checkers: not all these systems I have root on
03:09  thrig: how does not having root prevent symlinks from being created?
03:09  checkers: I don't understand your suggestion
03:10  thrig: can only root run 'ln' on these systems?
03:10  checkers: I don't understand how creating a symlink gets around the problem of needing to find where the source file exists
03:11  thrig: it pushes the problem to some script, instead of every time a new interactive shell is spawned

10:27  Mikachu: _2x2l: i guess ls /foo !!:*
10:31  _2x2l: Mikachu: ah hmm. alright. also, is there a way to reference the most recent string returned to STDOUT?
10:32  Mikachu: no
10:35  _2x2l: dang so im stuck using xargs or something eh?
10:40  Mikachu: well, no?
10:40  Mikachu: but only the terminal keeps printed text
10:40  Mikachu: and it has no idea about what's input and output
12:32  tlonim: is there a thing like ${x:?..} but which can execute a command/function instead of echoing ?
14:32  mamooth: hi there
14:33  mamooth: is someone aware of some zsh scripting framework/toolbox?
16:23  KarlHungus: i have a zshrc configuration that i use on freebsd primarily. when i use it on ubuntu 10.04 with zsh 4.3.10 it behaves differently. specifically, when i hit the up-arrow to retrieve the previous command the ubuntu version places the cursor at the beginning of the line, instead of the end. what could be causing this?
16:24  Yorokobi: ubuntu is using vi mode rather than emacs by default
16:24  KarlHungus: Yorokobi: i use vi mode as well
16:24  KarlHungus: i can paste the config if it helps
16:27  KarlHungus: http://pastebin.com/J7pR8zsb
16:51  fow: KarlHungus, IIRC Ubuntu places something in the global zshrc that does something with the up key. look there
16:58  KarlHungus: fow: well, i'll be damned. it sure does
16:58  KarlHungus: thats kind of aggravating =)
17:06  KarlHungus: silly ubuntu, always trying to do more than it should
17:06  ft: Not their fault entirely.
17:07  ft: They are using the debian package. And that's what is doing this.
17:07  KarlHungus: silly linux, always trying to do more than it should
17:07  KarlHungus: ;)
17:07  ft: But it has been like this for years and nobody ever complained to Clint. And now it's pretty unlikely to be changed.
17:11  KarlHungus: thats ok. i can just set this up myself in my local conf
17:12 * KarlHungus doesn't like package maintainers overriding defaults for me though
17:17  ft: all global shell config files suck as soon as your own is non-trivial. :)
17:17  Mikachu: can you just stick setopt noglobalrcs in .zshenv?
17:17  ft: yes.
17:18  Mikachu: but i guess /etc/zshenv will still be read first
17:18  ft: yes. :)
17:18  ft: There's no stopping that.
17:18  KarlHungus: i might as well define the keybinding i like anyhow, in case i check out my $home on some other funky linux distro
17:18  ft: IIRC even "zsh -f" reads the global zshenv... ...though I'm not too sure about that right now.
17:18  tlonim: theree is no /etc/zshenv in the zsh package here ..so good 
17:19  ft: /etc/zsh/zshenv for debian
17:19  Mikachu: well, you can ldpreload stuff :P
17:19  tlonim: not even that
17:43  nicoulaj: any Maven + zsh users here ?
18:26  felipec: hmm, the zsh git completion sucks
18:28  ft: I've said it before, I'll say it again. complaining here will not help. Tell -workers.
18:29  Yorokobi: I've noticed some work on _git in HEAD over the past couple of weeks.
18:29  ft: you did?
18:30  Yorokobi: Yep. 
18:30 * ft pulls
18:30  Yorokobi: There is some introductory work for git submodule, none of the submodule commands are available yet
18:31  ft: yeah, but there's nothing that would address any of the problems people keep complaining about.

20:30  jackdempsey: hey all, can anyone point me to a setting that i can use to tell zsh to not need another line to evaluate args like !$
20:31  jackdempsey: i have one zsh env where it works, and this new one needs another line/return hit to substitute the value, then i can run it
20:31  jackdempsey: if that makes sense, any tips would be appreciated
20:35  Mikachu: setopt nohistverify
20:35  Mikachu: or remove the line that presumably sets it
20:37  jackdempsey: thanks, will try that!
20:40  jackdempsey: sweet, perfect. that was getting mighty annoying....
21:26  ne0futur: hi all
21:26  Mikachu: hi
21:27  ne0futur: I m trying zsh , what is the charater to make a comment in zsh ? its not # and i cant find it in the man zsh or the zsh faq
21:27  Mikachu: it is #, but you can only use comments interactively if you setopt interactive_comments
21:27  Mikachu: in scripts they always work
21:28  ne0futur: it works ! thanks !
21:29  Mikachu: np     !
