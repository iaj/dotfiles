00:47  h00k: So, I'm pretty new to zsh, occasionally it opens to / and after 'cd' it changes to ~, I tried setting HOME=/home/anthony and restarting my session, but no lucj. Any protips ;) ?
00:47  h00k: s/lucj/luck/
00:49  thrig: what is the home directory set for the account in the password database?
00:49  Mikachu: zsh starts in the current working directory
00:50  h00k: My line is: anthony:x:1000:1000:Anthony Hook,,,:/home/anthony:/usr/bin/zsh
00:51  h00k: so, it appears to be /home/anthony
00:51  Mikachu: if you do "cd /tmp; zsh", you'll still be in /tmp
00:52  h00k: right-o. If I open a new gnome-terminal (that's the terminal I use), it opens zsh to /. Running 'cd' will put my pwd into my ~
00:53  Mikachu: then either gnome-terminal is weird, or whatever is launching gnome-terminal is in /
00:53  h00k: so, I guess why sometimes is it using / and sometimes ~
00:53  Mikachu: ls -l /proc/$(pidof gnome-panel)/cwd maybe
00:53  Mikachu: substitute whatever launcher you're using
00:54  h00k: launching it through gnome-do gives me ~ consistenly
00:54  h00k: lrwxrwxrwx 1 anthony anthony 0 2010-11-15 17:54 /proc/1861/cwd -> /home/anthony
00:54  Mikachu: well, check on something that puts you in / ;)
00:54  h00k: the keyboard shortcut I have (ctrl+alt+t) opens it to /, sounds like that's the issue
00:55  Mikachu: what handles keyboard shortcuts?
00:56  h00k: hmm, trying to figure that out what it's called.
00:57  h00k: gnome-keyboard-properties
00:58  h00k: so, it's probably not a zsh issue
00:59  h00k: they're both just launching 'gnome-terminal,' as far as I can understand
01:02  Mikachu: what's the cwd of the keyboard thing?
01:04  h00k: I am not able to find it, with or without it running
01:05  h00k: I'm an idiot, I lied, it's  launching 'gnome-terminal,' as far as I can understand
01:05  h00k: waitaminut
01:05  h00k: gnome-keybinding-properties
01:06  h00k: I don't see that, either
01:10  h00k: It also opens properly in 'docky' (to ~)
01:11  h00k: so, I'll dig into the gnome-keybinding-properties deal, somehow.

06:05  h00k: So, I figured it out, I'm just launching 'gnome-terminal --working-directory /home/anthony' from the Gnome Keyboard Shortcut application. All is well.

12:17  Cope: Is there an 'on-the-fly' way to chnage themes? I tried just expoerting the variable && exec zsh

14:19  tsdh: Cope: What's a theme?  Do you mean the prompts?
14:20  tsdh: If so, "prompt -p" gives a preview of all themes, and "prompt -s <theme>" activates a theme by its name.
14:53  cirwin: How do I ask zsh to autocomplete filenames after =s in any unknown arguments?
14:56  Mikachu: setopt magicequalsubst
14:58  virusys: hello
14:58  cirwin: hrm.. maybe it's just the rake completion overriding that
15:00  virusys: does anyone know how I can get emacs-style word delete (M-D) for zsh? I already have emacs set as my editing mode but holding M-D doesn't delete words in the same way as they do in emacs (delimited by / for file paths for example)
15:00  asyd: virusys: WORDCHARS in zshwiki
15:01  asyd: in the wikifaq
15:01  virusys: cool
15:01  virusys: asyd: thanks
15:09  anon33_: i find myself appending &! to commands pretty often - is there an alternative solution that allows for one-off commands with the autocompletion of a shell (on linux)?
15:20  tlonim: is there a way i can use chpwd profile for git repo dirs
15:25  tlonim: zstyle ':chpwd:profiles:../$PWD:t/.git(|/|/*)' profile git  --- doesnt work 
15:27  Mikachu: no idea what you're talking about
15:27  Mikachu: there's no "profiles" at all in zshall
15:30  tlonim: Mikachu: yeah.. :).. i was checking the grml chpwd profiles thing
15:31  tlonim: where based on cwd, different things can be done

16:00  tlonim: ok
16:00  tlonim: anyways found another way.. 
16:01  tlonim: btw, i am using  git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree to check whether pwd is under git vcs control
16:01  tlonim: is there a lighter way ?
16:08  Mikachu: you could check for (../)#.git
16:09  tlonim: Mikachu: yean..but the catch there is several levels inside the work tree
16:10  Mikachu: yes? that's why i wrote (../)#
16:11  tlonim: ah..sorry. didnt see '#'
16:13  tlonim: works.. let me check if that will be faster 
16:13  Mikachu: well, it should be since it doesn't fork
16:14  tlonim: true..
16:16  tlonim: quick question -- [[ -d '(../)#.git'  ]] doesnt work but test -d (../)#.git works... something wrong here ?
16:17  Valodim: you don't want ' there
16:17  Valodim: stuff inside ' doesn't get globbed
16:17  tlonim: but if i remove ' 
16:17  tlonim: it gives error
16:17  Valodim: right, because usually a null-evaluated pattern is an error
16:17  Valodim: you need to add N modifier, i think
16:18  tlonim: actually i used " earlier.. i gave ' by mistake.. 
16:18  tlonim: Valodim: ok.. let me see
16:18  tlonim: Valodim: actually it is a parser error
16:18  Valodim: if you use N modifier, a globbing pattern will evaluate to empty without giving an error. I dunno what -d thinks about no arguments at all though
16:18  tlonim: zsh: parse error near `('
16:19  Valodim: what's your line?
16:19  tlonim: [[ -d (../)#.git  ]] 
16:19  tlonim: thats it
16:20  Valodim: oh
16:20  Valodim: do you have setopt extendedglob in your script?
16:20  Mikachu: you can't do globbing in [[ ]] still
16:20  tlonim: that line i tried in interactive mode
16:20  paradigm: anon33_: look into "setopt nocheckjobs"
16:20  Valodim: in that case, what Mikachu said :)
16:21  tlonim: Mikachu: is the [[ in zsh builtin, otherwise for test i will end up forking anyway 
16:21  Mikachu: you want something like [ (../)#.git(N) ] probably
16:21  Mikachu: tlonim: both [[ and [ and test are builtin
16:21  Mikachu: or rather, [[ isn't a builtin, it's a syntax
16:21  tlonim: Mikachu: aha.. yeah. test is also builtin :)
16:21  tlonim: thought it was a separate thing
16:21  Mikachu: so it's parsed before globbing
16:22  Mikachu: so you can do things like [[ $variable = *foo* ]] to do text matching with wildcards
16:22  tlonim: Mikachu: ok.. [ (../)#.git(N) ]  works
16:22  Mikachu: usually it's not a good idea to do that, but neither ../ or .git starts with a - so it's safe
16:23  tlonim: or i think I will just do test -d <pattern> :)
16:23  Mikachu: the fun thing about [ of course is that [ -n (../)#.git(N) ] is always true, because when the glob doesn't match, you get just [ -n ] which is true ;)
16:23  Mikachu: if you use -d you will stat the dir twice, which is pointless ;)
16:23  tlonim: ah.. no -d 
16:24  Mikachu: and test foo is 100% equivalent to [ foo ] afaik
16:24  tlonim: ok
16:31  anon33_: paradigm: i don't think that's necessarily what i want, well, will it execute all programs in the background or just not warn me?
