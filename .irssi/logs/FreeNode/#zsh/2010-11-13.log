12:35  jure_: if I run the same command line more than once, the next line immediately after the one before, it gets stored into history the amount of times it was executed. how do I tell zsh to store it only once?
12:36  Mikachu: setopt histignoredups
12:37  jure_: thank you, Mikachu :)

15:34  lineinthesand: Is it possible to get a completion mechanism for ?
15:34  lineinthesand: sorry
15:34  lineinthesand: zypper
15:35  lineinthesand: I.e. completion of the name of new packages to install when I don't know the exact name.
15:39  Mikachu: what is zypper?
15:39  lineinthesand: Mikachu, it's a package management tool like apt-get (opensuse)
15:41  Mikachu: i found http://blog.homac.de/2010/03/29/z-shell-zsh-completion-for-osc-and-zypper.html but i don't see a download link anywhere...
15:41  lineinthesand: I remember having auto-completion of packages available for install in Mandriva linux, but I don't know which mechanism it used (and if it was in zsh or bash).
15:42  lineinthesand: Mikachu, yes, I found that too. But it's not exactly what I want to accomplish.
15:43  Mikachu: it looks exactly like what you want
15:43  Mikachu: only problem is that it's not downloadable :)
15:44  Mikachu: hm, looks like opensuse includes it in its zsh package
15:44  lineinthesand: Some guy who made me aware of zsh in the first place told me that it was possible to autocomplete package names available in the configured repositories (although somewhat slow).
15:44  lineinthesand: But I don't remember which distribution that was (I think it was gentoo).
15:44  Mikachu: well, the gentoo completion is very fast
15:45  Mikachu: since it's basically just a glob expansion
15:45  Mikachu: i found the completion he talks about, and it doesn't seem like it has any code to handle package names
15:46  lineinthesand: I see.
15:46  lineinthesand: But this /is/ possible with zsh, right?
15:46  Mikachu: should be pretty easy to make a completer, but i don't know how to list packages
15:46  Mikachu: sure
15:46  Mikachu: https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file?file=_zypper&package=zsh&project=shells it would be something like that, but slightly less bad
15:47  lineinthesand: OK. Well, I've bought a book about zsh, maybe I'll help me doing it...
15:47  Mikachu: doesn't look like he knows any zsh scripting at all :)
15:47  lineinthesand: Mikachu, well it's kind of complex from what I've read already.
15:48  Mikachu: yeah, but generally there's no need to use sed in completion code
15:48  Mikachu: all i'm saying is that it's not the best example to look at, apart from being for the actual program you want
15:50  Mikachu: i didn't really mean any offense to holger, now that i read what i wrote i see it's not the most polite phrasing ;)
15:50  lineinthesand: I'm going to look at that code...
15:51  Mikachu: the completer for apt-* is not pretty
15:51  Valodim: anyone know a smooth way to get something like "second last field" functionality from cut?
15:52  Mikachu: Valodim: ${${(s:<delimiter>:)parameter}[2]}
15:52  Mikachu: err, -2
15:52  Valodim: thank you mr. wizard :)
15:52  Mikachu: i like (s::)
15:53  Valodim: I can see why
15:53  Mikachu: i think there's a way to specify the splitter for $= too
15:53  Mikachu: but it doesn't really buy you anything
15:56  Mikachu: ah no i was confused, i was thinking of (w) but that uses (s::) to set the delimiter too
16:09  Mikachu: ft: i found a fun yodl issue i think, i can't figure it out
16:09  Mikachu: ft: /Force string arguments, the three lines after the [[ ]] example are unindented for some reason
16:11  Mikachu: ft: it's not to do with the parens inside the example, if i replace the contents with text it's still the same, if i put a newline after, it "fixes" it, but then there's a newline in the output
16:12  Mikachu: ft: the Ipswich example seems to use the exact same construct and doesn't have the problem

17:02  lineinthesand: How can I prevent zsh from offering ../ upon hitting tab while I'm changing to a dir which has no subdirs?
17:05  Mikachu: it doesn't by default
17:31  peth: whoa. vi-repeat-change repeats an included accept-line too.
17:31  peth: glad i found out with something harmless.
