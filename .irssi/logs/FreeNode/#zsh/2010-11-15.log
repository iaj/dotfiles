00:44  p_j: hi - i know i can bind up-line-or-search and up-line-or-down -- and I have to my up and down arrow keys, and it work fine.  Is there a way to tweak that option?  To work more like vim?  Let's say, I have two commands in my history:  "ls -al foo" and "ls -b bar" -- if I type in "ls -a" and press up, it should try and complete only that line with that option.  At the moment, it's not doing that.
00:44  Mikachu: up-line-or-down is a first for me
00:45  p_j: s/up-line-or-down/down-line-or-search/
00:49  teratorn: I just prefer to use this:
00:49  teratorn: bindkey -M emacs '^[p' history-beginning-search-backward
00:49  teratorn: bindkey -M emacs '^[n' history-beginning-search-forward
00:49  p_j: yes, which still doesn't do what i'd like.  i too use those bindings.
00:50  teratorn: oh
01:30  p_j: what ever happened to caphuso?  he was a complete prick but there used to be some good docs from him
01:54  Maahes: from the prompt, how do you reference functions defined in .zshrc?
02:00  peth: what. they're supposed to be just there.
02:04  teratorn: p_j: not every channel can stay like ##c forever
02:04  p_j: Phew :)
02:25  myrkraverk: teratorn:: What's ##c like?
02:26  myrkraverk: Maahes:: You can use preexec() and friends I guess.
02:27  myrkraverk: Or, if you just mean calling them, that's what you do.
02:53  p_j: but now ive fvwm problems with zsh - somehting eats my bindings. i know nothing about fvwm tho

04:01  werdnativ: Hi, I want to write a function that checks if a particular tool is installed. If yes then use it, else use a default tool.
04:01  werdnativ: Running the lookup directly each time is slow. What's the recommended way to cache it? Save a file in /tmp? export an env variable? Something else?
04:05  teratorn: werdnativ: what sort of checking?
04:05  teratorn: alias mytool='foo'; [[ -n $commands[bar] ]] && alias mytool='bar'

04:17  werdnativ: teratorn: https://gist.github.com/raw/676376/8fd8bf127c4bb42766766719991d88f716737709/man
04:19  werdnativ: basically I'd like to know if there's a better way to cache that lookup instead of running it every time I run `man`
04:26  teratorn: werdnativ: btw you can use -z instead of ! -n
04:27  werdnativ: ok, thanks.
04:28  teratorn: werdnativ: so hmm, could you just skip calling lsregister if USE_BWANA is non-zero?
04:28  werdnativ: yes. will that persist between calls to the function?
04:29  werdnativ: (I need to read up on variable scope in shell scripts)
04:29  teratorn: yep... since you haven't done 'local USE_BWANA' it is a global env var
04:29  eikenberry: werdnativ. Using 'type' should be faster, though not a cache.
04:29  teratorn: not exported.. so subshells/procs wont' get it
04:29  eikenberry: type was recommended the last time this came up on the mailing list.
04:30  werdnativ: oh, ok.
04:30  werdnativ: type?
04:30  eikenberry: type [command]
04:30  teratorn: alias for whence -v
04:30 * werdnativ looks it up
04:30 * eikenberry nods.
04:31  eikenberry: zshbuiltins
04:32  teratorn: is there any easy way to locate the source code for arbitrary built-ins?
04:36  werdnativ: not sure I understand how `whence` would help me. I guess that was meant for the alias example above?
04:40  eikenberry: It was in reference to the "I want to write a function that checks if a particular tool is installed" question.
