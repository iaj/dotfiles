07:27  peth: MJBrune: bindkey <key> backward-char
07:28  MJBrune: what key is the del key? del?
07:28  peth: that's not that easy. for a quick and dirty solution, find out by first hitting ctrl-v, then the del key
07:29  MJBrune: peth: i get ^[[3~   
07:30  peth: yes, you could just bind that. it may not work in other terms though
07:31  MJBrune: i get zsh: bad pattern: ^[[3~
07:31  peth: enclose in quotes. bindkey '^[[3~' backward-char
07:31  MJBrune: ooh ok
07:32  peth: for the more correct solution, see http://zshwiki.org/home/zle/bindkeys
07:32  MJBrune: peth: backward-char doesn't delete it, its just like pushing arrow left
07:32  peth: oh, hold on :)
07:34  peth: backward-delete-char should be it
07:34  MJBrune: no thats like the backspace key, im talking about the key under insert and home
07:35  MJBrune: which i wish my home and end key would go to the beginning and end of the command line as well :)
07:35  peth: god damn, it's too late. delete-char ?
07:36  peth: you can look those up in man zshzle | less -p STANDARD
07:36  MJBrune: thats it
07:36  MJBrune: ahh oh
07:37  MJBrune: do these keys perm bind or do i have to add this to my .zshrc?
07:37  peth: the latter
07:37  MJBrune: ahh ty
07:38  peth: np. be aware this will get a little more complicated when you want your zshrc to apply for different terms
07:39  peth: s/will/can
07:40  MJBrune: peth: your talking about not using zsh? as a shell?
07:40  peth: the terminal emulator program the shell is running in. like xterm or gnome-terminal.
07:41  MJBrune: oh
07:41  Nomexous: Try the $terminfo solution instead.
07:41  Nomexous: That should be portable to systems that support the terminfo database
07:41  MJBrune: Nomexous: ok
07:43  MJBrune: Nomexous: doesn't seem to work for Terminal
07:44  MJBrune: maybe it does and im not waiting enough time for it to take effect (like a log out)
07:45  MJBrune: yeah it works nvm
07:48  peth: \o/
07:49  MJBrune: lol
07:49  peth: have fun and good night :)
07:50  MJBrune: rt night

10:18  idl0r: hey guys, looks like i found a bug... "echo ${foo:0:}" causes a segfault here with 4.3.11
10:19  idl0r: can anybody confirm?
10:19  Mikachu: yep
10:37  Mikachu: idl0r: i've sent a fix to the mailing list
10:37  idl0r: Mikachu: cool, thanks :)
10:45  blueyed: Fatih`: "~<tab>" completes to all user home dirs and "special" dirs (e.g. via "hash -d l=/var/log"), that you may have defined.
10:47  Fatih`: blueyed, I didn't defined anything, it is possible to limit it only to users home dir ? For example root should be expand to /root, bu in for user it should expand to /home/usernamde

11:56  blueyed: Why does "." abort bck-i-search (Ctrl-R)?
11:57  blueyed: does not happen with "--no-rcs"..
12:05  blueyed: This happens because of rationalise-dot: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=W3gj0gsd (from grml IIRC)
12:07  Mikachu: bindkey -M isearch . self-insert
12:07  Mikachu: isearch aborts on any custom widget, even if it just wraps insert
12:08  blueyed: Thank you very much, Mikachu!
12:09  Mikachu: http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/1131e2dc88b2d920c12f8e218f011faa.txt is what i have btw
12:10  Mikachu: it got too annoying typing git log origin/master... for example :)
12:12  blueyed: I see. I will use yours, too.
12:23  unixnuub: hi there , I want to use bindkey to bind (for example) f5 to /usr/bin/firefox 
12:23  unixnuub: but can't see how it can be done 
12:23  unixnuub: (despite much reading, i don't think it can be done)
12:24  unixnuub: is it possible to somehow call a user defined function using bindkey or aliases ?
12:26  Mikachu: of course
12:26  Mikachu: zle -N foo; foo() { firefox >& /dev/null &| }; bindkey '~^{s_-)' foo
12:28  unixnuub: mikachu, you are very beautiful 
12:28  Mikachu: lol
12:28  unixnuub: hey dude, were you involved in fsniper 
12:28  Mikachu: no
12:29  unixnuub: ah, my error. 
12:29  unixnuub: check it out, handy inotify based app, good for a build system
12:47  unixnuub: ok man, I know adobe sucks, but i need to work with it to earn my crust
12:47  unixnuub: here's part of my zsh flashbuilder ide
12:47  unixnuub: zle -N foo; foo() { /usr/bin/chromium-browser $(noglob find -name *.swf -print -quit) >& /dev/null &| }; bindkey '^[[24~' foo
12:47  unixnuub: so in an directory (of my maven build) i press f12 and up pops the artefact 
12:47  unixnuub: thanks man
12:49  Mikachu: why wouldn't you just use **/*.swf instead of that whole $(find blabla) thing?
12:50 --- mren|off is now known as mren
12:51  unixnuub: I only want the first one, and I suspect the zsh globbing is a little slower than find, I could be wrong though 
12:51  Mikachu: it might be for very large directories, but otherwise that would be outweighed by the fork
12:51  Mikachu: **/*.swf([1]) is the first match
12:53  unixnuub: OK smaller is better, I likes it!

16:30  Will|: neater to make sure it's not already in there first, as I use the .zshrc on a few systems
16:30  Mikachu: neater to just add it, then typeset -U path

18:21  hellnest: hai, i've got a problem when customizing PROMPT. It can't display RPROMPT even i already configure it. DO i miss something?
18:23  hellnest: here's my zshrc for refference, maybe someone can help me. http://pastebin.com/g3b4bBQS
18:31  hellnest: hai, i've got a problem when customizing PROMPT. It can't display RPROMPT even i already configure it. DO i miss something?
18:33  peth: hellnest: short test says it's working here
18:33  hellnest: you try to use my config?
18:34  hellnest: can it related to my Xdefaults config?
18:34  peth: just the RPROMPT assignment
18:34  peth: don't really think so
18:34  peth: at least the [] should be visible
18:34  hellnest: do you mind to share your rc and xdef to pastebin just for my comparison
18:34  hellnest: yeah that's why, it's quite strange
18:35  peth: did you try to put that in the normal PROMPT for testing?
18:36  hellnest: PROMPT is working, but all themes or "prompt" themes that using RPROMPT isn't working
18:36  peth: oh, wait you use promptinit. maybe that's overriding your own assignments. i'm not familiar with that.
18:36  hellnest: hmm
18:36  hellnest: so i must disabled it?
18:36  fow: It shouldn't since the prompt function isn't used anywhere, but you should just get rid of that part entirely since it's not doing anything
18:37  peth: try to comment out everything prompt-related, and see if RPROMPT works then.
18:37  hellnest: try it now
18:37  peth: if yes, you can uncomment one by one 
18:38  hellnest: nah not working :)
18:38  hellnest: i disabled all including the zstyle also
18:39  hellnest: i was trying to use oh-my-zshell config from github just testing to see if it works or not. But still nill
18:39  hellnest: is it my terminal related issue?
18:40  peth: does the same prompt string work with the left-aligned prompt?
18:40  hellnest: i guess not, just installed xterm but still not working
18:41  hellnest: i guess the string isn't the problem.. Trying to replace it with other between L and R but still doesn't work
18:42  peth: i'm overasked then, without further research. sorry. best wait for one of the magicians to appear.
18:43  peth: or hope someone answers your post on the arch forums ;)
18:43  hellnest: lol you read my post too :P
18:44  peth: i tried a quick search and it came up first :)
18:44  hellnest: because i guess it's a rare issue :P hahaha
18:44  hellnest: before posting i'm digging the info from google but nothing related with my problem
