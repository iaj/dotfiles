01:13  Valodim: hum. how do I get the lines of some output into an array?
01:14  Valodim: I was thinking something like ${(f)$(stuff)}
01:14  Valodim: but since $(stuff) returns the words as array already, that won't work..
01:15  fow: ${(f)"$(stuff)"}
01:17  Valodim: I tried that as well and it didn't work for some reason.. was slightly different though, I'll give it a shot
01:17  Valodim: thanks
01:17  fow: you're welcome
01:27  Valodim: geez it still won't work properly
01:27  Valodim: I have it like this now: info=${(f)"$(~/tvdesc.py ${match[1]} ${match[2]} ${match[3]})"}
01:27  Valodim: and print -l $info prints out two lines with the proper info
01:27  Valodim: however, ${info[2]} gives me the second character of the first line
01:28  fow: info=( ${(f)...} )
01:29  Valodim: finally!
01:29  Valodim: thank you, again
01:30  fow: you're welcome :)
