14:48  ebzzry: peth: Thanks!
14:52  peth: kamcio2603: well, it reads like all you need to do is autoload bashcompinit and run it
14:52  kamcio2603: peth: only autoload?
14:52  kamcio2603: i try it 
15:14  peth: kamcio2603: i'm just playing around with it and can't get it to work either. it loads the bash completions ok, but complains about missing _get_cword and _split_longopt
15:14  kamcio2603: peth: it works ;)
15:14  peth: oh, nice! more luck than me it seems :D
15:15  kamcio2603: for my software it works great

17:28  SpookyET: Hi.
17:33  SpookyET: I'm trying to sort by version. Tried git tag | sort -n -k1,4 -t.  Unfortunately, I get http://paste2.org/p/1114973 which is not the desired effect.  I don't have sort -V.
17:49  peth: SpookyET: you could git tag | sort -t. -k1,2 -n -k3 or similar
17:50  peth: that worked for me just now
17:51  SpookyET: peth: Why didn't i think of trying more than one -k 
17:51  SpookyET: peth: Thank you
17:51  peth: np :)
