21:14  anon33_: say I just issued a command "dropbox puburl [FILE] | xcilp -sel clip" and was going to issue that same command, but with a different file
21:14  anon33_: is there a shorthand way of replacing that option without having to scroll through the last command and replace the path? 
21:16  Mikachu: well, if you know you're going to do that, the easiest way is to stand at the [FILE] and press alt-a (accept-and-hold) rather than pressing enter
21:18  anon33_: Mikachu: what does that effectively do?
21:19  anon33_: Mikachu: Ah, I see. Is there a way to delete to the next command? I know I can use CTRL-W to delete back a word...

21:32  anon33_: Mikachu: Nah,alt-f is bound to the menu's.. i'm really looking to improve how i move about the command line
21:33  Mikachu: well, barring brokenness in your terminal emulator, alt-f is forward one word in zsh
21:34  anon33_: It's basic convention in the OS that Alt+[first letter] activates the menu.
21:35  tlonim: can something like slicing be used in zsh for lhs ?
21:35  Mikachu: it's pretty stupid to steal the alt-key in a terminal emulator
21:35  tlonim: as in python 
21:35  Mikachu: tlonim: something like what for what?
21:35  tlonim: a,b,c,d = array slice
21:36  Mikachu: probably not
21:36  tlonim: Mikachu: in my script i want $1 $2 ... assigned to $a $b  etc
21:36  tlonim: i can do it one per line
21:36  tlonim: but is there a simpler way ?
21:37  Mikachu: don't think so
21:37  tlonim: ok
21:37  peth: anon33_: you may like what ^X^V can do for you
21:40  anon33_: peth: doesn't seem to do anything..
21:41  peth: anon33: agreed, it doesn't look like much. try F| after that. or f| if your cursor is at the beginning of the line
21:42  anon33_: peth: ah - puts me in vim mode
21:43  peth: :)
21:43  peth: i will get you back to emacs iirc
21:43  anon33_: i'm wondering whether or not i would rather have this all the time.. I use vim for everything
21:43  peth: uh, "i" will get you etc
21:43  anon33_: well, I know that -_-
21:44  anon33_: i mean a way in which i didn't have to press ^X^V to enter vim mode, it was just the default
21:44  peth: no, what i meant is "i" will not put you in the normal vi ins mode, but back into your normal mappings
21:45  peth: you can use vi bindings by default. either have you EDITOR env variable contain "vi", or set explicitly with bindkey -v
21:45  anon33_: peth: oh, sorry - i misunderstood. 
21:45  peth: you'll want to customize those, though. vanilla vi bindings are a little tedious, at least imo
21:46  peth: yeah, i expressed that rather poorly
21:46  anon33_: why do you say that? 
21:47  peth: i mean i probably could have been clearer about the whole "i" thing up there. it seems today is not communication day
21:47 * Mikachu is listening to Jim's Big Ego - Little Miss Communication (0:04 / 3:50) 
21:48  anon33_: No, I meant the vanilla vi bindings you mentioned
21:49  peth: well, you'll be staying in zsh's viins much more than in vi/vim's insert mode, so you'll probably want to beef up the ins bindings a little
21:49  peth: i know i did :)
21:50  anon33_: Could you link to a sample of code so I could get an idea of what you're talking about? Would it also be possible to get some sort of indicator that you've entered/left vim-mode/insert-mode?
21:53  peth: i'm currently fiddling with mine, but there's a ton of those on the web, some simple, some complicated.
21:54  peth: i used to do the mode indication with cursor color, which wasn't so clever on hindsight, so i'm rectifying it
21:54  anon33_: ah, okay. that seems to actually be pretty clever..
21:56  peth: i thought so at first, but it doesn't go well with gnu screen at all. :/
21:56  Mikachu: i use cursor color for overwrite mode :P
21:56  peth: because you're changing the cursor color on the term, it stays the same when you switch screen windows as zsh doesn't know about that
21:57  anon33_: Mikachu: ah, i see
21:57  Mikachu: right, screen should keep track of cursor color in each child :)
21:57  peth: :D
21:59 --- f8ld is now known as f8l
22:01  peth: while we're at, does anything speak against %S..%s'ing the %# prompt part? something i overlooked like i did with screen?
22:05  peth: i know. it's perfect! ;)
22:06  anon33_: i don't quite understand..
22:09  peth: %S and %s are prompt escapes that turn the terminal's standout mode on and off.
