04:30  myrkraverk: I am trying to set my umask to 0077 when I do ssh <command>
04:30  myrkraverk: I've tried putting it in ~/.zshrc, ~/.zlogin and ~/.zprofile and no luck yet.
04:30  myrkraverk: Is there anything else I can try?
04:31  thrig: why do you need to set the umask for ssh?
04:32  livinglifeback: is there a command to list supported prompt colors for zsh?
04:32  myrkraverk: It's my perforce account, I do stuff such as create checkpoints from ssh (though I could technically do that from the client instead).
04:32  myrkraverk: livinglifeback% Isn't that specific to your terminal instead?
04:34  thrig: myrkraverk: why not write a perforce wrapper that sets the appropriate settings then execs perforce?
04:34  myrkraverk: thrig% I guess I could do that.  I'm just wondering if this can be done at all.
04:35  livinglifeback: myrkraverk i think to an extent, all my terminals show red blue green in promts %{$fg[color]%}
04:35  livinglifeback: but ican't find a full list
04:35  teratorn: get a list of keys in that array
04:35  thrig: sure, there's ~/.zshenv, but I'd use a perforce wrapper to avoid a custom umask from breaking other things
04:35  myrkraverk: thrig% Since this account is only meant to run perforce and nothing else, I do not foresee a problem.
04:38  livinglifeback: teratornteraton was that directed toward me, and if so how do i get the keys for the array?
04:39  teratorn: echo ${(k)color}
04:40  livinglifeback: thank you
04:43  myrkraverk: Done with pam-umask ;-)
04:44  myrkraverk: Though I'd have preferred if it would have worked per user...
04:44  thrig: yes, it's called ~/.zshenv.
04:45  myrkraverk: ;-D
04:45  myrkraverk: Ok, I'll try that next ;)
04:46  myrkraverk: Yup ;)

10:56  tlonim: on zsh on freebsd, when i do autoload -U colors and colors i get error..but zsh version is pretty new zsh 4.3.4
10:57  tlonim: weird..
10:58  bapt: tlonim: I'm on freebsd et autoload -U colors && colors works here
10:58  tlonim: yeah..something is broken here i think
10:59  tlonim: bapt: on freebsd, all zsh related stuff will be under /usr/local/share/zsh right ?
10:59  bapt: pkg_info -L zsh\*
10:59  bapt: but yes to answer :)
11:01  tlonim: pkg_info: can't find package 'zsh*' installed or in a file! 
11:01  tlonim: but zsh is installed.. 
11:01  bapt: hum 
11:01  bapt: how did you installed zsh
11:02  tlonim: it is production server... not sure 
11:02  bapt: pkg_info | grep zsh
11:04  tlonim: bapt: looks like it is broken..thanks 
11:22  tlonim: does zsh have a rcfile option to specify other files ?
11:23  bapt: tlonim: yes it does
11:23  tlonim: --rcfile ? 
11:23  tlonim: i couldnt find it 
11:29  tlonim: there doesnt seem to be any IMO

12:43  emias: tlonim: If you set the environment variable $ZDOTDIR to some directory path, Zsh will read the user-specific configuration files from that directory instead of $HOME.
12:44  tlonim: emias: ah.. i cant set them to a file ? .. i have two files .zshrc and .zshrc.minimal ..on older servers i want to source latter 
12:46  tlonim: i will see a way to use $ZDOTDIR .. thanks
12:50  emias: tlonim: There's no way to source a file named .zshrc.minimal other than doing it yourself ("(( OLD_SERVER )) && . $HOME/.zshrc.minimal && return" or whatever).
12:51  tlonim: i dont want to source that file in addition, only that file ..
12:52  emias: tlonim: Yes, but you could put a line such as the one I suggested at the top of your .zshrc or whatever ...
12:52  tlonim: hmm.. yeah.that should work

13:12  hook_: Well, my prompt is going on nicely, but I'm still at odds when to use '%{$fg[blue]%}' and when '%F{blue}'...
13:12  hook_: Also do I need to initiate '%{$reset_color%}' after any part I want coloured?
13:24  mhi^: Hey, is it possible to do something like [[ $1 == $2 == $3 ]] or do I have to go for [[ $1 == $2 && $1 == $3 ]]?
13:25 --- hook_ is now known as silver_hook
13:27  silver_hook: (silver_hook == hook_) I mean I see many examples use the shorter '%F' way, but at least on zshwiki.org it says in PROMPT the right way is the longer one enclosed in '%{' and '%}'.
15:58  mAniAk-_-: what might the combo alt+left/right arrows be called in zsh/bindkeys?
16:13  estragib: mAniAk-_-: it doesn't work like that. what escape sequence will result from you pressing alt+left/right depends on your term. use a literal ^V followed by Alt+Left/Right to find out.
