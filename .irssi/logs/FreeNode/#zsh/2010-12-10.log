00:18  jdstroy: Anyone else wanna take a shot at it?  I can't get job control working in zsh.
00:34  esc: anyone got completion for eyed3? couldn;t find anything with google.
00:34  Mikachu: does eyed3 --help list options in gnu style?
00:34  Mikachu: if so, compdef _gnu_generic eyed3
00:35  esc: whats should have happend if it worked?
00:39  esc: nevermind, i am incredibly impressed
00:39  esc: :)
00:40  esc: i mean... thats really heavy
00:40  esc: Mikachu: i guess i put that in my .zshrc eh?
00:43  esc: Mikachu: :)
00:43  esc: oh... my... thats just wonderful! thanks so much!
00:48  Mikachu: esc: yeah it basically runs --help and parses the output
00:48  Mikachu: so be careful about using it for commands where giving --help does something harmful
00:56  esc: though its only a start, for some options i would of course want it to complete in a certain way
00:57  Mikachu: right, it isn't magic
00:58  Mikachu: usually, if it isn't distributed with zsh, it doesn't exist
01:36  gjvc: hi.  how can one set the colors of the completion prompts?  (by that i mean for example the text 'local directory:' when I type 'cd <TAB>')
01:42  Mikachu: zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format "%F{green}%d%f"
01:43  Mikachu: zstyle ':completion:*:warnings' format '%B%F{9}---- no match for: %d%f%b'
01:43  Mikachu: zstyle ':completion:*:corrections' format '%B---- %d %F{11}(errors: %e)%f%b'
01:43  Mikachu: zstyle ':completion:*:messages' format '%B%U---- %d%u%b'
01:43  Mikachu: %d is the actual text that is written
01:46  peth: is there a way to have process completion for eg. kill not replace my partial string with the first matching pid immediately?
01:46  Mikachu: but with what?
01:46  peth: leave my partial string, show me the matches
01:46  Mikachu: try ctrl-d
01:47  Mikachu: ah, that doesn't work :)
01:48  peth: just tried it with vi and emacs bindings to be sure :)
01:53  Mikachu: it does work generally, but with kill it still replaces the partial word
01:54  peth: oh, right! i defined a few zstyles. zsh -df is more like what i want
01:55  ij: Is it possible to have fish-like coloring?
01:55  Mikachu: possible, yes, feasible, no
01:57  peth: hrm. zsh -df doesn't do what i want at all. it just happened to filename complete .xsession which i was trying to kill :|
01:58  Mikachu: because you didn't compinit
01:59  peth: true. now it doesn't match strings at all and still goes by pid.
01:59  peth: i'll try to massage the styles some
01:59  peth: thanks!

18:41  variable: I'm trying to play with vcs_info -> it works in the command line - but when I move it to a function in .zshrc it fails to do anything
18:42  variable: meh - sorry - stupid mistake - I echoed the wrong variable
18:43  ft: heh. :)
18:44  variable: I tried to use _lastmsg instead of the exact _0_ 
18:46  ft: yeah, _lastmsg is a function. :)
18:47  variable: zsh: command not found: vcs_info_printsys
18:47  variable: :-\
18:49  variable: ah -> I need to call vcs_info first
18:50  ft: yes.
19:00  variable: ft, I can't figure out how to get the branch for hg. I have     zstyle ':vcs_info:*' get-revision "true"
19:00  variable: zstyle ':vcs_info:*' branch-format "%b:%r"
19:00  variable: but I still don't see it
19:28  ft: variable: it's in the _0_ variable, too if the matching format includes the branch percent code.
19:33  opk_: The intention is that you run vcs_info from precmd. That way the info remains up-to-date.
19:35  ft: True. If you're actually using it in a script you need to run the function in order to get updated information.
