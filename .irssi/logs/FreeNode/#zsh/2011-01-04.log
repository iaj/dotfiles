12:23  zk: i don't understand why foo="foo\nbar\nbaz"; echo $foo[(f)1] does not work
12:23  zk: if i set foo to like, foo=`/bin/ls` or something the subscript works fine
12:25  zk: but when i create strings by hand it doesn't seem to work
12:25  zk: none of the subscript flags seem to do anything
12:25  zk: actually i guess they do
12:27  zk: i guess if i do ws:\n: it works
12:28  zk: (f) is shorthand for wps:\n:, shouldn't \n be a non-printable character?
12:29  ft: foo="foo\nbar" does not include an actual '\n'. it contains a '\' and a 'n'.
12:29  zk: how can i include an actual \n
12:30  zk: when i echo it, it prints fine, so i'm a bit confused
12:30  ft: foo="foo"$'\n'"bar"
12:30  ft: echo does stuff behind your back.
12:31  zk: ok thanks for clearing that up!
12:31  ft: foo="foo\nbar"; printf '%s\n' "$foo"

16:03  iratik: I'm very new to ZSH. In switching from bash i've noticed the spelling correction and differences in tab autocomplete. As far as benefits, i haven't noticed much else. As far as problems, I noticed that it seems like when going up a command (To the last command executed) that I end up at the beginning of the line instead of the end. One thing that has been really frustrating though is that somehow when editing commands it seems like i keep accidenta
16:03  Mikachu: iratik: bindkey -e
16:04  iratik: bindkey?
17:48  rudi_s: iratik: Add the command to your .zshrc, man zshzle for more information about bindkey.
17:48  rudi_s: Btw. your message was cut off after "i keep accidenta".
18:14  pielgrzym: hi
18:15  pielgrzym: I'm a zsh user for a couple of years and it's first serious problem I came accross: in a xen domU based on CentOS 5.5 I've enabled utf etc. and can *display* polish characters, but not *write* them. In bash everything is fine. I tried using default zsh config - the same - garbage instead of special chars
18:15  pielgrzym: help ;)
18:17  ft: print $ZSH_VERSION
18:17  pielgrzym: 4.2.6
18:17  ft: upgrade
18:18  pielgrzym: ft: well, it's rhel-based os, upgrade isn't exactly the easiest way ;) no way to solve this?
18:18  ft: nope. 4.2.x doesn't have support for multibyte encodings.
18:18  pielgrzym: whoa
18:19  pielgrzym: it's more serious than I thought :/ how could red hat folks missed that *doh*
18:19  pielgrzym: ft: thanks for that info :)
18:20  pielgrzym: ft: which earliest version has support for multibyte encodings?
18:21  ft: that required a *major* rewrite of zsh's internals. I can't point you to a definite version.
18:21  pielgrzym: ft: ok :) thanks :)
18:21  ft: 4.3.10 and 4.3.11 are pretty stable though.
18:22  pielgrzym: ft: yeah, the problem is - I'd like some maintained versions so security fixes would be backported :/
18:22  ft: 4.3.11 was planned to become 4.4.0 unless something comes up in the near future.
18:22  ft: doesn't redhat maintain more recent packages?
18:23  iratik: K.. after finguring out the bindkey stuff .. I feel as though I've been enlightened. I'm in love with ZLE and the fact that it lets me use vim key bindings to edit the current command.  Just a few catches..  I can't seem to get it to search forward and reverse by using "/" like i do in vim. I also can't seem to do search and replace on the current command like i'm used to .. tips?
18:24  pielgrzym: ft: it seems that they forgot about this one :/
18:24  ft: odd.
18:25  pielgrzym: yup
18:25  pielgrzym: nonetheless thanks for help - I'll try to update :)
18:31  iratik: Okay .. how about this. In bash, after setting the bash line editor to use vim commands, in command mode you can hit "v" and open up the current line in vim for editing. Equivalent for zsh?
18:35  thrig: bindkey v edit-command-line or somesuch
18:35  danielsh: I don't know, but fc edits the previous line
18:37  danielsh: No such widget `edit-command-line'
18:38  danielsh: ^^^ loaded compinit and compinstall, what am I missing?
18:40  peth: havo to autoload that one too
18:40  peth: s/o/e
18:42  peth: autoload -U edit-command-line; zle -N edit-command-line etc
18:44  danielsh: nice
18:45  danielsh: peth: works, thanks
18:45  danielsh: oddly when I leave $EDITOR it drops the insertion point to the end of the line, not to where I was, but that's an issue with the edit-c-l widget I suppose
18:48  peth: you could probably customize that if you remember and restore the cursor pos, but...
18:53  danielsh: ... but it's easier to just call it again and open $EDITOR

19:07  Nezmer: hi, with bash, I do something like (f=$# ; cd ${!f}). How can I do this with zsh?
19:11  thrig: what does that do?
19:12  Nezmer: thrig: never mind. I got it. cding to the last argument. eval cd $"$#" works
19:14  anon33_: how do i send a process to the background so that I can close the terminal without killing it?
19:14  Nezmer: anon33_: process&!
19:14  thrig: bg; disown  or that
19:23  anon33_: thanks :)
19:28  nicoulaj: Is there a way to force saving the current ZLE buffer to history ?
19:28  nicoulaj: I'd like to make a widget to have the command savec to history when doing a CTRL-C.
19:29  nicoulaj: Ho, I see there's a thread about this on mailing-list
19:31  thrig: nicoulaj: or something like bindkey ... push-line-or-edit perhaps

22:33  webflo: whats the best way to create optional arguments in autocompletion? this is my command: 'drush @foo subcommand' @foo should be optional. like standard unix options (-h or --help). these options are not visible by default only after typing a hyphen
22:34  Mikachu: reimplement _arguments i guess
22:34  Mikachu: unless it has an option for the option character, it probably does
22:35  webflo: Mikachu: but i have these normal options too
22:35  Mikachu: i don't know what happens if you call _arguments twice
22:53  webflo: Mikachu: maybe it is possible as optional first level argument?
23:00  nicoulaj: I don't get the difference between _wanted and _requested
