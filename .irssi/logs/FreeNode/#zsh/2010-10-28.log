12:11  mrchrisadams: hi guys, I've switched to using zsh shell, and I'm having trouble using ack to search for strings that include square braces. What's the recommended way to handle escapes searches these days?
12:11  mrchrisadams: i.e. I want call: ack features[heartbeat]
12:12  mrchrisadams: is noglob !! the cleanest way?
12:12  Mikachu: er, just quote them
12:12  Mikachu: "foo[bar" or foo\[bar
12:13  ft: alias ack='noglob ack'
12:14  mrchrisadams: that's what I thought, but that was returning no results
12:15  mrchrisadams: I was calling noglob ack features[heartbeat]
12:15  ft: noglob echo foo[bar]
12:15  ft: works for me.
12:16  mrchrisadams: okay so the issue is my ack syntax or ackrc file
12:16  mrchrisadams: thanks chaps

21:50  mklappstuhl: hey i'm having problems displaying umlauts ... i can enter them and they get displayed correctly but when i to 'and' there is an umlaut i always get the regular character (a,u,o) and a space after it
21:54  anxiolytic: When I do cat /dev/null > file.txt it says file exists. How do I force this to overwrite?
22:08  mklappstuhl: anyone an idea?

23:40  mklappstuhl: hey again
23:40  mklappstuhl: does anybody remember my question and has an idea?
23:42  Yorokobi: mklappstuhl, it is probably a terminal problem rather than a shell problem
23:43  mklappstuhl: Yorokobi: apparently this is a problem since i removed .oh-my-szh 
23:45  Yorokobi: I have never looked at omzsh. One solution is to specify a compose key either through your DE or via 'setxkbmap -option -option compose:<somekey>' (ie, ralt -- right alt)
23:46  Yorokobi: Then use the compose key with the two char combo to create the special char you want
