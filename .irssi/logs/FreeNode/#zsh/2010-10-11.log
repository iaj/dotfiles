09:51  hpt: hi
09:52  hpt: a='6apples'
09:52  hpt: [[ $a =~ '[0-9]+' && $a == $MATCH ]] && echo oh
09:53  hpt: +zsh:208> a=6apples
09:53  hpt: +zsh:208> [[ $a -regex-match '[0-9]+' && ! 6apples == 6 ]]
09:53  hpt: +zsh:208> echo oh
09:53  hpt: oh
09:53  hpt: why zsh add a '!' after '&&' here?
10:35  henrikbjorn: it does the exact same thing on ubuntu
10:37  henrikbjorn: ohh its the colors modules fault
10:38  henrikbjorn: or the prompt
10:43  henrikbjorn: export PROMPT="$fg[cyan]%}%m%b%{$reset_color%}: %~ $ " doesnt this look right ?
10:44  ft: a %{ is missing, at least.
10:44  ft: and don't export PROMPT.
10:48  henrikbjorn: ft: where is it missing and should i just set it then (remove the export part)
10:51  henrikbjorn: awesome that fixed it!!! >D
10:53  ft: good. :)
11:12  iaj: whats the difference between prompt= and export prompt= ?
11:28  ft: one is a shell parameter, the other an environment variable.
11:29  ft: There's no point in putting something into the environment, that external programs don't need.
11:29  ft: and no external program needs zsh's prompt definition.
11:37  iaj: Ahhh, thanks ft - making sense now !
12:11  henrikbjorn: ft: PS1 is only to support bash configurations?
12:13  ft: henrikbjorn: hm?
12:14  henrikbjorn: i just noticed that PS1 is supported as PROMPT is
12:15  ft: yes, they are the same value.
12:15  ft: but that doesn't have anything to do with bash. the syntaxes are completely different.
12:24  henrikbjorn: okay
12:25  henrikbjorn: what does LC_COLORS do ?
12:25  ft: LC_? Are you sure you don't mean LS_?
13:12  henrikbjorn: yeah LS
