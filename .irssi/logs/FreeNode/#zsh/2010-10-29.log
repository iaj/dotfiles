00:23  mklappstuhl: Yorokobi: it shows me für "Übung": "U\314\210bung"
00:23  Yorokobi: it?
00:24  mklappstuhl: git status für example
00:24  mklappstuhl: ls only shows a space after U -> "U bung"
00:24  Yorokobi: ah, you're expecting 'o' but getting 'ü'
00:25  mklappstuhl: no i expect ü 
00:25  mklappstuhl: could this be a problem of a prompt i use?! (adam2 – default)
00:32  mklappstuhl: and in terminal settings encoding is set to utf-8
01:21  mklappstuhl: okay as i found out it definitly has something to do with the prompt … 
01:24  mklappstuhl: however i cant explain why since there shouldnt be any relation between the prompt and unicode support or?

08:36  mklappstuhl: I asked that yesterday and I still didnt find a solution... example: if I tab-complete a path and there is an ä in it i always get 'a<0308>' instead of the ä ... 
08:37  Mikachu: mklappstuhl: setopt combining
08:37  Mikachu: mklappstuhl: setopt combiningchars
08:41  mklappstuhl: Mikachu: now I get 'a' instead of 'ä' but this is already an improvement
08:52  mklappstuhl: any ideas how i could get an 'ä'?
08:53  mklappstuhl: git status also show me strange this: 'a\314\210' 
08:54  mklappstuhl: my terminal is set to utf-8 and this is the only setting (i know about) which could affect this
08:57  teratorn: mklappstuhl: are you sure those bytes combine to produce ä? can you save the bytes to a file and view them with some tool (an editor?) that does it correctly?
08:57  Mikachu: 308 is combining diaeresis
08:58  Mikachu: \314\210 is the octal representation, 308 being hexadecimal
08:58  Mikachu: 308 also being the code point and the other being the utf8 bytes
09:02  mklappstuhl: in ls I do get umlauts but with a space after each one
09:03  mklappstuhl: no matter how the directory/file was created
09:04  Mikachu: you're using osx/hfs and your terminal doesn't support combining chars
09:04 --- insomnia1alt is now known as insomniaSalt
09:04  Mikachu: which is sort of a bad combination since hfs enforces nfd normalization
09:10 --- wuehlmau1 is now known as wuehlmaus
09:13  mklappstuhl: Mikachu: it worked without any problems a long time...
09:18  wuehlmaus: hi, all
09:18  wuehlmaus: is there something about that new command line coloring feature of zsh in the wiki?
09:18  wuehlmaus: i want to learn it :)
09:19  wuehlmaus: must be very late add for zsh
09:22  Mikachu: you mean zle_highlight and region_highlight ?
09:22  Mikachu: they're fairly well documented in the man page
09:23  wuehlmaus: Mikachu: feh showed me some weeks ago
09:23  wuehlmaus: i did not learn new zsh features for a long time :)
09:23  wuehlmaus: thanks for the names
09:24  Mikachu: i occasionally get confused and forget the gh in high :)
09:25  wuehlmaus: haha
09:25  wuehlmaus: yes, happens
09:34  mklappstuhl: Mikachu: isn't there any proper way to get this working? 
09:35  Mikachu: sure, use a proper terminal that supports combining characters
09:57  Tasser: is there a fancy way to execute a commado mutltiple times with a different ENV var?
10:02 --- insomnia1alt is now known as insomniaSalt
10:08  rudi_s: Tasser: for x in whatever; do A= B= C= program; done? Maybe including env
10:08  Tasser: hmm
10:09  Mikachu: for ENV in value1 value2; do program; done ? :)
10:09  Mikachu: just export ENV first
10:10  Tasser: for env in val1 val2 val3; do export ENV=$env; program; done
10:10  Mikachu: export ENV; <what i wrote>
10:10  Tasser: hmm
10:10  Mikachu: once a variable is exported, it stays exported, regardless of how you assign to it
10:10  Tasser: oh oke
10:11  Mikachu: % export test42; for test42 in hello there; do env; done|grep test42
10:11  Mikachu: test42=hello
10:11  Mikachu: test42=there
10:11  Tasser: oh oke
10:11  Tasser: nice to know.
