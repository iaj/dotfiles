13:50  tdn: I have a script that waits a random amount of seconds and then executes a command: sleep $(($RANDOM % 1000)) && foo. Now I would like to echo the amount of seconds before sleeping.
13:50  tdn: So that I will have an idea of how many seconds I have to wait.
13:50  tdn: How to do this?
13:50  Mikachu: a=$b
13:51  tdn: I tried X=$(($RANDOM % 1000)) echo $X && sleep $X but that does not work. $X is empty.
13:52  tdn: What am I doing wrong?
13:52  tdn: 'a=2 echo $a' outputs empty line.
13:54  strull: tdn: I think the $a is expanded before it is assigned to
13:54  tdn: How do I solve that?
13:55  Mikachu: a=$b
13:55  Mikachu: echo $a
13:55  tdn: Mikachu, I would like to do it on one line. Is that not possible?
13:55  tdn: Maybe with ; between?
13:55  Mikachu: why?
13:55  tdn: Mikachu, because it must be given to another program that uses it. And this program accepts only one line.
13:56  Mikachu: sounds like you're not giving the whole story, you said it was a script earlier
13:56  tdn: I can change the program to accept several lines, but that is non-trivial at this point.
13:56  tdn: Mikachu, yeah, I am not. Because it is a rather long story. :)
13:56  Mikachu: okay, good luck with that then ;)
13:58  tdn: Can it not be done on one line then?
