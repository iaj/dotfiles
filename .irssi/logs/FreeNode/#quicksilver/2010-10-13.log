11:18  redii: greetings
11:19  oksushi: hi redii
11:19  redii: with QS, what's the best way to find apps that due to their spelling are not being matched during app launching?
11:19  redii: can't quote it...etc
11:19  redii: hi oksushi
11:20  oksushi: can you give an example?
11:20  redii: sure...that was pretty unclear
11:21  redii: an app named "think"....can't launch with qs because it picks up (getting example)...
11:21  redii: picks up "dthink" which is another app
11:22  redii: want /^think$/
11:22  oksushi: you can 'assign abbreviation' or wait until the ranker ranks the requested app higher
11:23  redii: ok...
11:23  redii: i'll check the docs for that
11:24  redii: the ranker was my prob as "think" is a better match than "dthink" in this case, clearly
11:24  redii: was perplexed
11:35  redii: oksushi: hmm
11:35  oksushi: no good?
11:35  redii: i see how to assign a trigger to it
11:36  redii: don't want to mac it any diff than just typing enuff to be unique
11:36  oksushi: in the first pane, select the application, second pane, type 'assign abbreviation'
11:36  oksushi: then type the letters you would like to use to retrieve the app, hit return
11:39  redii: sorry dude...in what top-level "tab" do i pick "application from the first pane in
11:43  redii: oh
11:43  redii: got it
11:43  redii: stacked panes...
11:44  oksushi: :)
11:44  redii: thanks oksushi
11:44  oksushi: no probs
