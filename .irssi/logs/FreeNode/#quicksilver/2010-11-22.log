20:03  jeffschuler: Quicksilver is no longer providing me the top-level folders of catalog items -- neither from the User nor Custom catalog groups...
20:03  jeffschuler: if I type one of those items in the Quicksilver search panel, I see the "... (Catalog)" entry, but not the actual filesystem directory as an option.
20:04  jeffschuler: none of those items has the "Omit source item" checkbox clicked
20:06  jeffschuler: if I remove and re-add these directories from the Custom catalog section, I continue to have the same issue with them.
20:07  jeffschuler: if i add new items, though, I don't seem to have this issue with them.
20:07  jeffschuler: any ideas as to how I might've lost those, or retrieve them?
20:13  jeffschuler: The folders that show up in Quicksilver searches as "... (Catalog)" only, are also listed in the catalog as "... (Catalog)" -- like "Downloads (Catalog)", "Documents (Catalog)", "Desktop (Catalog)"...
20:14  jeffschuler: I can't access (open a finder window to) any of these items through Quicksilver now -- I can only go to their catalog entries...
20:52  jeffschuler: anyone?
