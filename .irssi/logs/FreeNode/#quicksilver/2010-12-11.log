17:46  _ulises: hello all
17:47  _ulises: newbie here (of course) and I'm trying to call a custom python script from QS however I'd like to pass arguments to it
17:47  _ulises: so far I've been able to do so like: . -> script foo bar baz <TAB> "Run in terminal"
17:47  _ulises: but I'd like to reduce the number of keypresses by just being able to type "script foo bar baz" <RET> and be done with it
17:48  _ulises: google hasn't been my friend and I'm currently searching the mailing list with no luck
17:48  _ulises: any advice?
17:50  _ulises: (hopefully the solution won't be "learn applescript and port your script")
18:16  iaj: _ulises: still up?
18:17  _ulises: still up :)
18:17  iaj: http://pastebin.com/venrHR8t
18:17  iaj: what about that?
18:18  _ulises: ah! ideally I'd be able to say "awesome, thanks!"
18:18  _ulises: however my use case is ... weird it seems
18:19  iaj: you'd still ahve to enter qs in text mode enter 3 arguments tab over and well, id just set a certain key to run [P]ython script
18:19  iaj: dang :\
18:19  _ulises: my python script sends me email to my gmail account
18:19  _ulises: which I use to send me notes to self
18:19  _ulises: so, in a terminal I do: $ note remember to call Joe and talk about the stuff found in http://www.example.com/
18:19  _ulises: and I'd like to do that from QS
18:20  _ulises: it's a sort of poor man's remember the milk really
18:24  _ulises: incidentally, what's the difference between "run in shell" and "run in terminal"?
18:36  iaj: dunno what the difference is :\
18:36  iaj: note is your python script?
18:36  _ulises: yes
18:36  iaj: why don't you simply. http://pastebin.com/tLxMPKwS
18:36  iaj: ?
18:37  _ulises: well, because I don't know any AS :)
18:37  iaj: hhe.. ok... me neither - but imho its needed for customizing quicksilver to ones needs
18:37  iaj: even though I really would like to write custom plugins for quicksilver in any other language
18:38  _ulises: incidentally, I find it interesting that I may be the first person to need this?
18:38  _ulises: I mean, surely launching a custom script with custom parameters isn't such an unreasonable thing to do?
18:42  _ulises: any idea of where I could find the QS logs?
18:47  iaj: hmm dunno in Console maybe?
18:48  iaj: I think there have been ppl who need this actually
18:48  _ulises: sorry, I'm still new to OS X :)
18:48  iaj: I'd just like to have a trigger to boost it up... and JUST have to enter the text
18:48  _ulises: that'd be nice
18:58  _ulises: right, so with the right combination of options I can now type "note this is just a test" and it will go directly into text mode (since there's no match) and the first option will be "run in shell"
18:59  _ulises: apparently the difference between run in shell and run in terminal is that the latter opens a new terminal, runs the thing and remains open for output inspection while the former runs the thing under /bin/sh
18:59  _ulises: my problem now is that /bin/sh doesn't find note :/
18:59  _ulises: despite me having all the paths set correctly (obviously not since it's not working)
19:00  iaj: hmmm
19:01  iaj: hows it look like? your script..? and wheres note placed?
19:01  _ulises: interestingly enough 'ls -l' does work
19:01  _ulises: note is in /Users/ulises/bin/
19:01  _ulises: and ln -s to /usr/local/bin
19:01  _ulises: the script looks ok, with full paths for the python interpreter, etc.
19:01  iaj: shouldnt matter I thnk.. did you try the /usr/local/bin on?
19:01  iaj: s/on/one
19:03  _ulises: yes, it does seem to work
19:03  _ulises: unless /usr/local/bin is not in the default set of paths
19:07  _ulises: ho-hum, ln -s to /usr/bin seems to do the trick
19:09  _ulises: anyhoo, thanks for your help chaps, that seemed to do the trick for me
19:13  iaj: ok ;-) glad to be of help.
