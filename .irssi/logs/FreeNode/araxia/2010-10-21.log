21:29 --- Query: Starting query with Araxia on FreeNode
21:29 iaj: hey Araxia 
21:29 iaj: are you around somewhat?
21:29 iaj: I could need a helping hand in applescript
21:30 Araxia: yeah. finally got irc going on my laptop again.
21:30 iaj: Congratulations
21:30 Araxia: what's up?
21:30 iaj: when your in germany
21:30 iaj: give me a call
21:30 iaj: we need to celebrate
21:30 iaj: :D
21:30 Araxia: heh
21:30 iaj: see I got the following fragment
21:30 iaj: http://pastebin.com/BiGDp1Qi
21:31 iaj: BUT... what if the query list only contains one element
21:31 iaj: then the is not null part is wrong
21:31 iaj: well its wrong anyway :)
21:31 iaj: I want to check whether theres a second element in theQueryList or not..
21:32 iaj: theQuerylist is "foo bar" for example
21:32 iaj: or! "foo" only
21:32 Araxia: okay. let me have a look.
21:32 iaj: thanks buddy
21:32 iaj: :))
21:33 iaj: Oh btw have you ever had any path issues with MacVim?   And were you the one using PeepOpen?
21:33 Araxia: no path issues here. haven't looked at peepopen. not too keen on paying for a vim plugin.
21:37 iaj: hmm okay.. strange :\
21:38 Araxia: so what do you want "theToPart" to be if item 2 doesn't exist?

21:47 iaj: hmmm just nothing :-)
21:47 iaj: theres just an exception thrown
21:47 iaj: the way it is right now
21:49 Araxia: i updated the pastebin.
21:49 Araxia: just added some error handling.
21:50 iaj: ?! huh
21:50 iaj: not visible for me
21:50 iaj: http://pastebin.com/BiGDp1Qi
21:50 iaj: ?!
21:51 Araxia: http://pastebin.com/UwqAug6W
21:52 Araxia: hrm. that's pretty lame. no link to the modification from the original.
21:52 iaj: hmpf -_- pastebin :\
21:52 iaj: I shall use pastie instead
21:52 iaj: just got that quicksilver script :D
21:54 iaj: Yeah its working :-)
21:54 iaj: try -_- on error.. should have thought about that
21:54 Araxia: which quicksilver script?
21:55 iaj: ahw sorry
21:55 iaj: I ment that pastebin Plugin
21:55 iaj: Its not in /Actiosn
21:55 iaj: ./Actions
21:56 Araxia: strange that for all the syntax definitions pastey.net supports, applescript is not one of them.
21:58 iaj: mhh yeah.. where and how do you usually paste to?
21:59 Araxia: i usually use the paster.vim script configured for pastey.net
21:59 iaj: oh so you usually paste stuff from vim only
21:59 Araxia: yeah. i do just about anything that i'd want to paste in vim anyway. :-)
22:00 iaj: hmm yeah
22:01 iaj: Im just about to figure out how to efficiently write code in java with VIM
22:01 iaj: without a GUI
22:01 Araxia: it may take some work and some patience.
22:01 iaj: im just curious whether theres a way to have ctags work to follow CLASS+TAG
22:01 iaj: foo.bar()
22:01 iaj: abc.bar()
22:01 iaj: when I go to that bar
22:02 iaj: and hit CTRL-]  its not following correctly
22:03 Araxia: yeah, that's where you really miss the static analysis capabilities of an ide.
22:06 iaj: so theres no way to fix that?
22:06 iaj: Means i would have to go to the class
22:06 iaj: another way is there any way to jump to certain functions WITHIN the class I'm looking at?
22:06 Araxia: yeah. there are a whole range of different jump commands.
22:07 iaj: taglist is only for SEVERAL files correct?
22:07 iaj: eg to jump to definitions in other classe
22:07 iaj: s
22:07 Araxia: it can work within a single file, too.
22:08 iaj: yeah but I'd have to run ctags over and over then I think
22:08 iaj: btw do you have your vimrc and vimfiles up somewhere?
22:08 Araxia: have you read through :help tagsrch.txt
22:08 iaj: rambo3 on tv here
22:08 iaj: yeah !:)
22:09 Araxia: yeah, i think the general strategy there is to automatically rererun ctags on a file whenever it changes.
22:09 Araxia: http://bitbucket.org/araxia/araxia-mac-os-x-tools/src/tip/vim/
22:10 Araxia: only my .vimrc at the moment.
22:10 iaj: hmmm ok... that's a way to go yeah... :-)
22:11 iaj: which languages do you code ?
22:11 Araxia: and there is probably quite a lot of existing stuff out there that does at least some of what you're after.
22:12 Araxia: i've mostly done java at work. shell scripts. occasionally applescript. lately objective-c and python.
22:12 iaj: which colorscheme are you using in MacVim  -_-
22:12 iaj: yeah
22:12 Araxia: and vimscript. :-)
22:12 iaj: I just need to configure it properly
22:12 iaj: I just found out about eclim
22:13 Araxia: i use a modified version of a colorscheme called kellys.
22:14 Araxia: eclim is a tall mountain to climb. never quite got there, myself. seems like it might be the way to go if you really want to do java in vim, though.
22:18 iaj: hmm yeah... it really is... I don't find the real help up until now... but since its offering all the eclipse functions...
22:19 iaj: It must be the choice :-D
22:19 iaj: netbeans with jvi is good as well... but I try to stick to vim at first
22:19 iaj: I would like to LIVE in vim actually hah
22:20 Araxia: i found the biggest hurdle with eclim to be that i had to decide which eclim functions to bind to which keys, and having to develop my own strategy for that keymapping.
22:20 iaj: heh yeah I need to first figure out WHICH of the eclim Functions I need
22:20 Araxia: if it had some good default keybindings, that would go a long way towards making it more accessible.
22:20 iaj: yeah
22:21 iaj: im using CTRL-SPACE for completition so far only from eclim
22:21 iaj: do you know whether theres a way to have classnames highlighted
22:21 iaj: or function/method names?
22:22 Araxia: again, without static analysis, vim's regex method of identifying syntax tokens isn't sufficient for that level of precision.
22:23 iaj: oh... alright :\
22:23 iaj: PITY
22:23 iaj: but it could cooperate with eclim to know whether its a class name or not
22:23 iaj: :p
22:23 Araxia: yeah, that's definitely one of the nicer features of an ide.
22:23 Araxia: it might be able to. i'm not sure offhand how it would, but i wouldn't rule it out as impossible.
22:26 iaj: heh.. Im just crawling through its documentation
22:26 iaj: would be nice if it did.
22:26 iaj: btw you were using <C-c> to exit vimmode
22:26 iaj: everywhere, weren't u?
22:26 Araxia: well, in vim at least.
22:29 iaj: hm ok... are you using zsh
22:29 iaj: because you will have a problem there
22:29 iaj: haha
22:29 Araxia: not yet.
22:30 Araxia: well, you could remap it i'm sure.
22:31 iaj: hmmmmm its kinda weird to do , according to the zshgurus
22:31 iaj: well Im trying to get used to CTRL-[ now
22:31 Araxia: probably a good idea.
22:31 iaj: jj is a pity as well
22:31 iaj: CTRL-[ will be faster after a while
22:31 iaj: btw you should stick to IRSSI
22:31 iaj: theres a vim mode now :)
22:31 Araxia: i just like the idea of being able to use one hand, for some reason.
22:32 iaj: hmm yeh
22:32 Araxia: i like having a dedicated irc app. i've always got an irssi session going on my server, though.
22:36 iaj: hm - ye i thought that way as well but VIM just convinced me
22:36 iaj: heh

22:42 Araxia: ubiqvim has reduced my urge for a "vimmed-out" irc app.
22:43 iaj: what have you bound it too?
22:44 Araxia: not sure what you mean. how do i activate it? Tap right-command key is the one i use most.
22:44 iaj: heh... I use that one as well
22:47 iaj: dw and stuff ain't working right?
22:48 Araxia: yeah. text-objects are nearly impossible given the mechanism for implementing commands.
22:48 Araxia: and motions, and ranges, and....
22:48 Araxia: it's definitely not an ideal environment for developing a full-fledged vim emulation layer.
22:49 iaj: hm yeah but I guess it was never supposed to be 
22:49 iaj: :-)
22:49 Araxia: yeah. it's quite a hack indeed.
22:49 iaj: hehe :)
22:50 iaj: you are using that thing a lot
22:50 iaj: to focus the menubar correct?
22:50 iaj: i think ctrl-shift ;
22:50 iaj: is what you mapped it ot
22:51 Araxia: yeah. been trying out Cmd-Opt-/ lately, though.
22:51 Araxia: er, Cmd-Shift-/
22:51 iaj: k
22:52 iaj: ohh.. ok
22:52 iaj: I just found myself trying to get to the open recent tab
22:52 iaj: in File'
22:52 Araxia: Cmd-Shift-/, type part of the menu item name, hit Right-command to activate ubiqvim, use jk to navigate the menu.
22:53 iaj: when I enter O.... i can't just make it to get to the Open Recent menuitem
22:53 iaj: hm
22:53 iaj: alright lemme check :)
22:53 Araxia: hrm. i guess the Cmd-Shift-/ doesn't work so well with sub-menus.
22:53 iaj: what binding is that ⌘-shift-/
22:54 Araxia: or maybe it does…it lists all of the submenu items right there!
22:54 iaj: in keyboard prefpane?
22:54 Araxia: i think it's help or help search.
22:54 iaj: since I rebound ⌘ shift /   already ha
22:55 Araxia: heh
22:55 Araxia: Application shortcuts -> show help menu
22:56 iaj: Ahww. aight. thanks :)
22:57 iaj: Do you know whether I could make CTRL-[ to act as Escape on all Mac Applications?
22:57 Araxia: with kr4mb, you could. not sure otherwise.
22:58 iaj: but it ain't in there already
22:58 iaj: correct?
22:58 Araxia: yeah, it's not there yet.
22:58 Araxia: i've got it on my todo list for the next submission of ubiqvim, though.
22:58 iaj: heh, Yay :-)
22:59 iaj: oh my new way is to fire up vims help menu stuff.. then enter 'recent' and then tap right command and go through that list
22:59 iaj: heh
23:00 iaj: or I just insert the name directly
23:00 iaj: pretty awesome
23:00 Araxia: cool
23:00 iaj: but its not working on firefox :(
23:01 Araxia: ah, yeah. firefox is evil that way...
23:01 Araxia: but there is a workaround.
23:01 iaj: rally?
23:01 iaj: How to?
23:01 Araxia: you can define mappings with vimperator and use the :emenu command.
23:02 Araxia: here's an example of what i did to enable Cmd-M to activate the Zoom menu:
23:02 Araxia: map <M-m> :emenu Window.Zoom<CR>
23:02 Araxia: imap <M-m> <Esc>:emenu Window.Zoom<CR>
23:03 Araxia: i just put those lines in my .vimperatorcc file.
23:03 Araxia: i've also got: imap <C-c> <Esc>
23:03 Araxia: :-)
23:03 iaj: heh
23:03 iaj: yeah thanks :)
23:05 iaj: which vimp colorscheme are you sticking to?
23:05 iaj: I just set ,m to <Esc>:emenu 
23:05 iaj: so I can enter my stuff then
23:06 Araxia: hadn't even looked into vimperator colorschemes at all yet.
23:06 iaj: heh
23:06 iaj: i see :)
23:06 Araxia: not a bad idea, though. the default one has too much mauve for my tastes.
23:06 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/278594
23:07 iaj: try that one
23:07 iaj: called myzenburn
23:07 iaj: its nice imho
23:10 iaj: autocmd Filetype java inoremap <C-Space> 
23:10 iaj: but why ain't that working :\
23:12 Araxia: what are you mapping it to?
23:13 iaj: Ok its wokring now I HAD TO RELOAD the buffer
23:13 iaj: ^X^U
23:13 iaj: The completion from eclim
23:13 Araxia: gotta go eat. back later.
23:13 iaj: do you happen to use supertab?
23:13 iaj: ohh
23:13 iaj: ok
23:13 iaj: enjoy mate:-)
23:13 iaj: laters.
