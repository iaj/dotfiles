18:41 --- Query: Starting query with Araxia on FreeNode
18:41 iaj: hey mate
18:42 iaj: you up?:)
18:42 iaj: long time no c ;)
18:44 Araxia: hey. yeah. started a new job. been pretty time-consuming.
18:44 iaj: hahah.. as the starting always is :)
18:44 iaj: but you fine I hope?
18:45 Araxia: yeah. doing pretty well. new job involves learning ruby and rails, both of which are new to me. fun stuff.
18:45 iaj: wwwwoww... id love to do ruby and rails
18:45 iaj: or python :)
18:47 Araxia: ruby is really a pretty incredible language.
18:48 iaj: :-)
18:48 iaj: i wanted to ask, you use iTerm or Terminal?

19:50 Araxia: i tried iterm for a while, but now i'm back to terminal. not sure i could tell you why. maybe just because my hard drive died and when i set up again terminal was already there.
19:51 iaj: hah.. ok.. and screen I guess?
19:51 Araxia: oh, yeah. i don't use a commandline without first opening a screen session. :-)
19:52 Araxia: i recently added vcs information to my bash prompt. it's been pretty helpful. shows me which vcs, the current branch, and how many dirty files.
19:53 iaj: heh.. yeah I got that too :)
19:53 iaj: how do you scroll in your terminal?
19:54 Araxia: i've also got a pretty nice setup with synergy at work. i've got my personal laptop next to my work laptop and i can hit a hotkey to switch from one to the other, with a nice growl notification indicating which machine i'm on.
19:55 Araxia: put up a short video of using it: http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/araxia
19:57 iaj: do i need to reg there?
19:57 iaj: :-)
19:57 iaj: im gonna throw a look... but how do you scroll in terminal when screen is running?
19:57 Araxia: no. it's just a micoblog site.
19:57 Araxia: s/mico/micro
19:58 iaj: http://www.tumblr.com/login
19:58 iaj: its sending me there :)
19:58 Araxia: <C-a><Esc> to enter copy mode, then the usual vim coarse navigation commands: search, <C-f>, <C-b>
19:58 Araxia: hrm. one sec.
19:59 Araxia: ah, here: http://araxia.tumblr.com/
19:59 iaj: why do I need to specify an url there?
19:59 iaj: haha
19:59 iaj: ok :)
19:59 iaj: you do use the real escape key?
19:59 Araxia: the other link was for editing
19:59 Araxia: actually, i guess <C-a>[ works, too. that's what i use.
19:59 Araxia: not *positive* that wasn't a customization i made at the moment, though.
20:00 iaj: I don't get it.. what exactly is that doing??
20:00 Araxia: mastering screen's copy mode is extremely useful.
20:01 iaj: i mean theres only one screen isn't there?
20:01 iaj: hotkey from one to another.. on... external keyboard or what?
20:01 Araxia: yeah, you can't see the other screen. i guess that takes away some of it.
20:01 iaj: but external keyboard it is?
20:02 iaj: can you share the vim colorscheme :)
20:02 Araxia: basically, when your keystrokes and cursor commands are going to a remote machine via synergy, you see that notification indicating where your typing is going to go.
20:03 iaj: I think I'd need to see it in action :)
20:03 iaj: so you got 2 laptops placed next to each other
20:03 Araxia: so you don't start typing thinking that it's going to go where you're *looking*.
20:03 Araxia: yeah.
20:03 iaj: and control them over one keyboard
20:03 Araxia: yeah.
20:03 Araxia: hit a hotkey and input is switched from one laptop to the other.
20:04 Araxia: it's like a virtual kvm.
20:04 Araxia: if you ever use multiple machines at the same time, it's pretty awesome.
20:08 iaj: mhh yeah... I took a note :)
20:08 iaj: Hmmm do you use divyy? I just watched the screencast
20:08 iaj: looks good
20:09 Araxia: yeah. i broke down and paid for it. been very, very happy with it.
20:10 iaj: heh... Im using a tool but sometimes its breaking :(
20:10 Araxia: yeah, i was using applescripts, but they were slow and unreliable.
20:11 iaj: any else new... well apps :)
20:12 Araxia: i've been playing around with the voiceover utility. that could be super-powerful configured the right way.
20:12 Araxia: i really need to write up my explorations of that. it's not very easy to describe briefly how to set it up to demonstrate some of its cool features.
20:13 iaj: hmm have you set up some hotkeys with divvvy?
20:14 Araxia: yeah. full screen window, half-size left, half-size right, quarter size in each position.
20:15 Araxia: and each of these will alternate between the laptop display and the external display.
20:15 iaj: wow ... good thinking:)
20:15 iaj: what hotkey did you assign to those?
20:17 Araxia: <D-C-q>, <D-C-w>, <D-C-e>, <D-C-[1-4]>
20:17 Araxia: i recently discovered the :gui command in vim, to pop open a file i'm editing in the console in macvim.
20:19 iaj: hmm one can assign global shortcuts to those?
20:19 iaj: individually?
20:19 Araxia: yeah.
20:20 iaj: i thought its just working out to invoke, nad then hit another key
20:20 Araxia: you can use it that way, too. i tried that at first.
20:20 Araxia: prefer the globals right now.
20:20 iaj: k im gonna config it :)
20:21 iaj: the growl style is awesome as well
20:21 Araxia: it's minorly tedious to configure initially, but worth it.
20:21 Araxia: yeah, i love that one.
20:21 Araxia: do you know about the mono growl style?
20:21 Araxia: also very nice: http://fixedgear.ca/
20:22 iaj: ahhhhhhh
20:22 iaj: where do I put those styles?
20:23 Araxia: just double-click them and they'll install themselves.
20:24 iaj: hmmm a bit too big for my 13" mbp :)
20:25 Araxia: heh
20:25 Araxia: got another one for you, then....
20:25 iaj: :-)
20:26 Araxia: try b-gamma: https://github.com/kreeger/b-greek
20:28 iaj: sec :)
20:30 iaj: ahh that one is nice heh
20:30 iaj: you tha growl man!
20:30 Araxia: i just scoured the net for growl styles just last week. :-)
20:31 Araxia: the official growl styles page hasn't been updated in ages.
20:31 iaj: hhheh yeah
20:31 iaj: so true
20:31 iaj: daaaaaamn
20:31 iaj: no more free keys
20:31 iaj: hahah
20:34 Araxia: heh. yeah. that's definitely a problem.
20:38 iaj: ok i think ill use... shift,ctrl+RETURN
20:38 iaj: to invoke
20:38 iaj: and then h for left l for right and so on ;)
20:38 iaj: quicksilver is eating all my keys
20:38 iaj: haha
20:38 iaj: have huge problems in photoshop
