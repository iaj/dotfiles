20:47 --- Query: Starting query with shabble on FreeNode
20:47 iaj: lo ther
20:47 iaj: :-
20:47 iaj: :-)
20:47 iaj: you up?
20:48 shabble: yrah
20:48 iaj: I've just a little well - kind of off question- which key do you use for escaping in either irssi, vim ?!
20:49 shabble: usually C-c
20:49 shabble: but sometimes esc
20:49 iaj: so in VIM you use C-c as well?
20:49 shabble: yeah
20:49 shabble: esc is a bit of a reach on this keyboard
20:50 iaj: hmm yeah - im just trying to figure out whether to use jj or <esc> or <C-c> or even <C-[>
20:50 shabble: I have capslock bound to control, which makes it a bit easier on the fingers
20:51 iaj: yeah.. same here :) i had it mapped to escape - but since Im using screen I tend to hit CTRL a lot :)
20:52 iaj: oh no.. now I know why I didn't use C-c
20:52 iaj: you don't use a shell a lot I guess, do you?
20:52 shabble: yeah, a fair bit
20:53 shabble: you have to know which terms not to do it in, certainly :)
20:53 shabble: or do you mean !bash from vim?
20:53 iaj: well because I use zsh shell with vibindings... and I had a problem with <c-c> there
20:53 iaj: nahh zsh shell mate:)
20:53 shabble: aah
20:54 shabble: one day I'll get roudn to some zshing
20:54 shabble: it's been on my list for at least the last year :)
20:56 iaj: ahh.. heh.. yeah... well I do most of my stuff on shell
20:56 iaj: and ... zsh is just the best that ever occured
20:57 shabble: yeah, I've hit the limits of bash in some directions, and I keep meaning to get zsh going
20:57 shabble: but it'll take a lot of learning and setup to get it to how my shell is now
20:57 iaj: but what bindings do you use in bash?
20:57 shabble: emacsy ones
20:58 iaj: oh.. yeah.. that might be.. you should take a look at -   from bash to zsh
20:58 iaj: great book imo
20:58 shabble: never really liked the readline vi mode
20:58 iaj: heh.. yeah.. well... its a little bit a pain at first
20:58 iaj: but I got used to it :)
20:59 iaj: the more places I use vi the faster I get.. that's what I'm thinking.
20:59 iaj: but since I can't use <c-c> in zsh shell I need to stick to <c-[> i guess
20:59 shabble: yeah, although the jj idea does intrigue me
21:00 shabble: since it is fairly unlikely as a normal string you'd t ype
21:00 iaj: yeah but jj is kind of slow... i think c-[ is faster over time
21:01 iaj: dunno actually :\
21:01 iaj: have there been any improvements to vim_mode the last few weeks?
21:02 shabble: mostly a couple of bugfixes, haven't seen rudi_s in a while,a nd I've been busy and a bit of ill
21:02 iaj: oh, hope your fine again - yeah rudi has a lot to do with college I guess
21:03 shabble: yeah
21:03 iaj: and his internet provider seems to piss him off a little bit :)
21:03 shabble: hehe, yep
21:03 iaj: :-)
21:04 shabble: I think the big stuff like :imap needs a fairly big change to the input processing structure, so it's going to take a bit of time
21:04 shabble: but there's some little stuff I keep meaning to fix, like history searching with / ?
21:04 iaj: mhh yeah ... your updating the dev branch?
21:04 iaj: or master?
21:05 shabble: I mostly just commit straight to master
21:05 shabble: because I'm lazy
21:05 iaj: hahahah.. ok :)
21:05 shabble: but in future, will be using dev and pushing only working things to master
21:05 shabble: I need to get round to fixing/checking a few things so we can tag a 1.0 release
21:06 iaj: that's the common way of doing eh?
21:06 iaj: yup.. guess simon will be back soon as well
21:06 shabble: hopefully
21:06 iaj: is perl a nice language?
21:06 shabble: I think the most 'typical' way of working is to start a feature branch based off dev, then merge it back in when done for testing, then merge to master when it's ready for public
21:07 shabble: I think so
21:07 shabble: but many people disagree :)
21:07 iaj: so that master is never bug affected - yeah makes sense
21:07 iaj: well "never" that is.
21:07 shabble: yeah
21:07 shabble: but bugfixes go straight to master, which is all I've been doing recently
21:08 iaj: once I got some spare time I think I will throw a look into perl as well.
21:08 iaj: perl/javascript/python/php .. the list is just never ending :\
21:12 iaj: when you switch buffers in irssi-vim
21:12 iaj: how do you do?
21:12 iaj: <c-c>:b<partofbuffername> ?
