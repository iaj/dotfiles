12:53 iaj: lo there shabble
12:54 iaj: can I ask you a quickie - is it possible to map ,b to :b<space>  in command mode?
12:55 shabble: um, I'm not sure :)
12:55 shabble: what happens when you try?
12:56 iaj: 12:56:15  vim_mode: Error in ex-mode command buffer
12:56 shabble: oh, ok
12:56 shabble: let me take a look
12:57 iaj: heh... thought you'd know it of the hook - sorry about that
12:57 shabble: rudi did all the mapping stuff, and I never did quite understand it :)
12:57 shabble: good time to learn though!
12:57 shabble: you might have to bear with me for a little while, and test a few screwred releases tho :D
12:58 iaj: hehehe... well not a problem... ill bear with it... already sooo got used to the vi here
12:58 iaj: unbelievable, heh

13:05 shabble: hmm, what should :b<spc> do?
13:05 shabble: it doesn't seem to actually do anything atm
13:06 shabble: as far as I can tell, the fallback if it's not a digit is to search for matching channels
13:06 iaj: it shall just print that
13:06 iaj: so that I can enter a buffer
13:06 shabble: oh, I see
13:06 iaj: it should replace :b<space> keypresses only
13:06 iaj: heh
13:07 shabble: crap, not sure if that works at all :P
13:07 iaj: hehe.. not a problem - i was just curious :)
13:07 iaj: gonna get used to CTRL-[ : b  buffername as well
13:08 shabble: let me have another looka t map, see if there's a way to do that
13:08 shabble: it seems useful, anyway
13:09 iaj: what do you mean?  what seems useful?
13:10 shabble: to be able to map partial commands, and have them inserted into the ex buffer
13:10 shabble: so you can finish them off and hit enter
13:10 iaj: ahh.. i see now
13:10 iaj: yeah:)
13:10 iaj: ofc :-D its my idea after all

13:35 shabble: can you pull from master, and try that?
13:35 shabble: syntax is :map ,b #:b<space>
13:35 shabble: the # is important
13:35 iaj: wee you are pretty faste mate
13:35 iaj: n1 ! ill check it out in a sec
13:40 iaj: k loaded
13:40 iaj: sec
13:40 iaj: awesome
13:40 iaj: its working :)
13:40 iaj: iwhere is the rc file stored btw?
13:40 shabble: ace
13:41 iaj: and how do I save to the rc file?
13:41 iaj: heh :D
13:41 shabble: can you check that other bindings ie: normal ones, aren't affected?
13:41 shabble: eeeer
13:41 iaj: hmm i don't have any bindings :)
13:41 shabble: ~/.irssi/vim_mode_rc I think
13:41 shabble: vim_moderc
13:42 iaj: hmm how do I create such an rc?
13:42 iaj: i don't have it yet
13:42 iaj: was manually making my maps.. haah
13:42 shabble: :mkv should do it
13:42 iaj: im not restarting irssi that often anyhow.. but .. just in case
13:43 iaj: hmm its creating my old mapping :map ,b :b
13:44 iaj: hmmm ok seems to be correct displayed that way?
13:44 shabble: #hmm?
13:46 shabble: ah yeah, it fails on loading again
13:46 shabble: hmmm
13:46 shabble: time to invesitgate
13:46 iaj: it fails on loading again?
13:46 iaj: wtf :)
13:47 shabble: it's already expanded when it's saved, so it loses the special info that makes in insert rather than just tyr to be called
13:47 shabble: I'll hve to fix that
13:47 shabble: but first, some git jiggery-pokery to fix stuff
13:47 iaj: git jiggery-pokery hahahah
13:47 iaj: lmao
