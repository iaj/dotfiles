00:00  ragecryx: uhm hi im a newbie, recently started learning java and I wanted to ask this: in c++ its common to put class definition to a .h or .hpp file and method definitions in a seperate .cpp file, in java we put all the code inside the class definition? or there is something similar?
00:01  pfn: it's all in a single .java
00:02  ojacobson: ragecryx: you do that in C and C++ because there's no way to infer linkage points from a compiled object file.
00:02  svm_invictvs: ragecryx: No.  Java is fundamentally different in its implementation.  Without getting into a huge discussion abou thow both languages are architected...simply put it's just how Java is.
00:02  ojacobson: In Java that's not true, so there's no need for a separate file containing all your symbols.
00:02  ragecryx: i see thanks a lot guys
00:02  andern: if all i want is a dynamic sized array with add/remove-possibility, is there a class that is preferred over arraylist?
00:02 @cheeser: nope
00:02  andern: nvm, i don't even need remove
00:03  andern: all i need is dynamic size and add
00:03  svm_invictvs: ArrayDeque?
00:03  svm_invictvs: ...maybe?
00:03  ojacobson: ArrayList is fine
00:03  ojacobson: O(1) insert at the right-hand end (amortized).
00:03  ojacobson: Self-sizing.
00:04  ojacobson: Good cache locality for iteration.
00:04  andern: k, i just feel like i use it too much sometimes
00:04  andern: :-)
00:04  svm_invictvs: ~linkedlist
00:04  javabot: svm_invictvs, linkedlist is almost always slower than ArrayList/ArrayDeque. It might be best to use ArrayList/ArrayDeque to start. But if you have an actual performance problem, you can compare the two for your specific case. Otherwise, just use ArrayList.
00:05  converge: hi, whats a specialized class.. ?
00:05  svm_invictvs: converge: IN what context?
00:05  andern: svm_invictvs: ok thanks
00:05  svm_invictvs: andern: Yeah, there's a fact for that.
00:05  andern: ~arraylist
00:05  javabot: andern, I have no idea what arraylist is.
00:06  svm_invictvs: ~javadoc ArrayList
00:06  javabot: svm_invictvs: http://is.gd/3DLBr [JDK: java.util.ArrayList]
00:06  converge: svm_invictvs: dont know.. im just trying to understand what it is..
00:06  svm_invictvs: ~javadoc LinkedList
00:06  javabot: svm_invictvs: http://is.gd/3zPzr [JDK: java.util.LinkedList]
00:06  svm_invictvs: ^^
00:06  svm_invictvs: andern: ^^, rather
00:07  andern: svm_invictvs: yeah, i just wanted to check if it had any more tips on using arraylists other than what was mentioned in ~linkedlist
00:08  SJr: I have a bunch of Event Objects, and I was going to simply put in a Map<Class, Set<Listener>>, to map specific Event Types to specific Listeners, but I think that Subtypes will break with this, i.e. if someone subtypes one event, it will not catch/match the subtypes.
00:08  SJr: What is the best way to do this?
00:08  tgodar: converge: in C++ that might be in reference to template specialization, I think they just mean a class 'specific to a need' though
00:08  ojacobson: ~events
00:08  javabot: ojacobson, events is http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html
00:08  ojacobson: ~event listeners
00:08  javabot: ojacobson, I have no idea what event listeners is.
00:08  ojacobson: hm
00:09  ojacobson: ~event dispatching
00:09  javabot: ojacobson, event dispatching is Generally done with FooListener which implements a fooOccured method which takes a FooEvent. Classes then take a FooListener, adding it to an internal set, then that class calls fooOccured() on each FooListener, or see http://alchemy.grimoire.ca/m2/sites/ca.grimoire/event-dispatching/
00:09  ojacobson: ^ that's the one.
00:09  ojacobson: I wrote some glue for handling this. You should have a look at how it's built, or just use it (it's in central)
00:10  SJr: thank you
00:10  nafri: hello, I've written a program which connects and sends commands to telnet server... but when i try to recieve data i don't receive anything
00:11  nafri: I'm using  bufferedReader.readLine() to read data from telnet server
00:11  nafri: any idea?

00:19  converge: tgodar: in java specialization could be inheritance ?
00:20 --- Channel ##java was synced in 128 seconds
00:21  tgodar: converge: perhaps.  without context hard to say - and as established I know nothing about Java ;)
00:23  svm_invictvs: converge:Yes, that's one use.
00:27  SJr: What Exception should I throw if a method isn't implemented yet? UnsupportedOperationException?
00:28  cbeust: Sjr, about your class/listener question earlier, take a look at this:  http://beust.com/weblog/2010/07/26/local-message-bus/
00:29  Sniffy: could just make your own
00:30  svm_invictvs: SJr: That's a good one.
00:31  svm_invictvs: SJr: Or have your own NotImplementedException extends UnsupportedOperationException
00:31  SJr: Hmmmmm thanks
00:31  Sniffy: yeah
00:31  Sniffy: i'd do that
00:31  svm_invictvs: SJr: I think, though, that UnSupportedOperationException conveys to the user of the code accurately enough that, for whatever reason, that operation isn't supported.   a message in the logs would probably help.
00:31  SJr: null is not an instanceof anything right?
00:32  svm_invictvs: throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Not yet implemented.");
00:32  svm_invictvs: SJr: Correct.
00:32  svm_invictvs: SJr: if (null instanceof Foo) will always be false, if the compiler even allows for that.
00:32  Sniffy: is NULL an object?
00:32 @jottinger: you mean "null?"
00:32 @jottinger: and it's a reference, if you mean "null" and not "NULL"
00:32  svm_invictvs: Sniffy: null, and no it's not
00:33  SJr: My Java's rusty haven't worked on it, with a year, just checking to make sure
00:33  sproingie: ~tias
00:33  javabot: Try it and see. You learn much more by experimentation than by asking without having even tried.
00:33  Sniffy: is there a difference?
00:33 @jottinger: Sniffy: you mean, has java become case-insensitive since you used it last?
00:33  Sniffy: hardly specific to java
00:33  SJr: in PHP null is case insensitive.
00:34 @jottinger: sure, which makes the question even funnier
00:34  sproingie: yes, because php is fucking retarded
00:34  svm_invictvs: Sniffy: "NULL" isn't anything in Java.
00:35  Sniffy: being a bit anal i think
00:35  Sniffy: and i said NULL because i've been coding in occam for ages
00:35  Sniffy: so a habbit now
00:35  svm_invictvs: Sniffy: No, we're not.  NULL and null are different in Java.
00:35  svm_invictvs: Sniffy: I see.
00:35  sproingie: it must be trollsday
00:35 @jottinger: it's frakkin' idiot month.
00:35  jfarrell: hey guys, i need some advice
00:35 * _lennart is now away: afk
00:35  Sniffy: what's the difference?
00:35 @jottinger: and I can't begin to tell you how annoying it is
00:36  jfarrell: i am working on a project with a former colleague in Eclipse
00:36 --- _lennart is now known as _lennart^afk
00:36 @jottinger: Sniffy: between what and what
00:36  sproingie: _lennart^afk: get rid of your god damned away message
00:36  jfarrell: but he is running Windows I am running Unix, what is the best way, in Eclipse, to maintain our JAR files?
00:36  Sniffy: should fine something better to do with your time then maybe
00:36 @jottinger: jfarrell: just use eclipse.
00:36  Sniffy: find*
00:36  svm_invictvs: jfarrell: mavn
00:36  svm_invictvs: jfarrell: maven?
00:36  svm_invictvs: rather
00:36 @jottinger: and sure, use maven
00:36 <-- joed has kicked _lennart^afk from ##java (can you remove your away stuff, thanks.)
00:36  jfarrell: svm_invictvs: not sure what that means
00:36  sproingie: yay
00:36  svm_invictvs: jfarrell: maven is a tool that manages your dependencies.
00:37  svm_invictvs: javabot: ANd your build environment
00:37  javabot: svm_invictvs, I have no idea what ANd your build environment is.
00:37  sproingie: ~maven
00:37  javabot: sproingie, maven is is a software project management and comprehension tool, found at http://maven.apache.org/ . It can construct, build, install, and document your project. Generally loved by its adherents for being comprehensive and able to locate dependencies by name rather than file, and hated by everyone else for being overcomplicated and underarchetyped. See #maven on irc.codehaus.org
00:37 @jottinger: damn it, how the hell can I watch this piece d'crap run if the network doesn't update!!!11!
00:37  svm_invictvs: jottinger: Get pissed.
00:37  sproingie: you want to maintain a library of jars, it's hard to beat maven
00:37  svm_invictvs: jottinger: It helps.
00:37 * jottinger fumes, not very happy at all
00:38 @jottinger: svm_invictvs: in this case, it doesn't, because what happens is cisco just ignores me
00:38  svm_invictvs: Yay.  My code only fails 300 unit tests.
00:38  sproingie: get pissed as in mad, or pissed as in drunk?
00:38  sproingie: the latter helps but only if you're so smashed you don't care
00:38  svm_invictvs: sproingie: Get pissed as in mad.
00:38  svm_invictvs: sproingie: It's called irony.
00:39  sproingie: i recomment "objet d'merde"
00:40  svm_invictvs: heh
00:40  sproingie: as a name for something.  i wold probably stay away from a drink named that.
00:40  svm_invictvs: piece of shit?
00:40  svm_invictvs: jottinger: What's happening?
00:41  javaPythonSnake: if Color has pink or magenta, purple should be included.. That is just my opinion, granted nobody asked :).
00:42 * cbeust approves `objet'd'merde`
00:42  svm_invictvs: javaPythonSnake: Howabout just a large enum of every possible color?
00:43  javaPythonSnake: Yes.... heh
00:43  SJr: Why do I recall there is a way to make methods local, like instead of having to call Math.rand() all the time, there is a way to make a rand() call
00:43  cbeust: SJr: static imports
00:43  SJr: Ah that's it
00:43  sproingie: ~static import
00:43  javabot: sproingie, static import is http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html
00:44  sproingie: yay my random factoid poking actually worked
00:44  ShadowHntr: hey where does jre normally storm it's runtime classes
00:44  sproingie: rt.jar
00:44  ShadowHntr: path wise
00:44  javaPythonSnake: I remember that was all over the exam for some reason as well as an alarming number of assertion questions.. Figured assertions are a thing of the past.
00:45  sproingie: wherever/java/is/lib/rt.jar probably
00:45  sproingie: use the file find feature on your os
00:45  svm_invictvs: Is there a way to get maven to keep going despite failed unit tests?
00:45  pantsman: yes
00:45  pantsman: ... I forget how. There's an option for it.
00:46  svm_invictvs: I see.
00:46  pantsman: googling for "maven ignore test failures" is how I'd proceed.
00:46  svm_invictvs: yeah, I want to go through all the tests that failed so I can go in anc change them :-/
00:46  sproingie: javabot: asserts are hardly obsolete and should be used with wild abandon
00:46  javabot: sproingie, I have no idea what asserts are hardly obsolete and should be used with wild abandon is.
00:46  sproingie: doh
00:47  sproingie: ^javapythonsnake
00:47  pantsman: asserts are great if you want to to design by contract
00:47  javaPythonSnake: JUnit.
00:47  sproingie: that's essentially what they're for.  you use asserts on invariants, stuff that must always hold or the program's broken
00:48  sproingie: not for anything that could just be exceptional
00:49  pantsman: JUnit does not replace any need for assert, if that's what you meant, javaPythonSnake
00:49  sproingie: they make for good documentation too
00:51  javaPythonSnake: I mean that's not entiely true, but ok.. My only come back would be, I'm lazy and if I forget I have assertions, could throw assertion errors. << all I got.. :)
00:51  cbeust: javaPythonSnake meant TestNG
00:51 @joed: Heh
00:52  sproingie: if you start throwing assertion errors, it means you broke something internally or forgot to update your assertions
00:52  sproingie: asserts don't even get checked unless you use the -ea flag
00:52  ahhughes: paulweb515, jottinger - following things up from a few hrs ago on low level class generation... this is not generating a class but it will work. The "annotation processing too" APT should be able to do what I need it todo :)
00:52  sproingie: ohhhh right testng uses assert
00:53  cbeust: sproingie: it's more that TestNG is so much better :)
00:53  javaPythonSnake: I don't know..I guess they're used if you use them
00:53  sproingie: cbeust: not that you're biased or anything :)
00:53  sproingie: cbeust: but i agree
00:53  cbeust: I am a model of objectivity
00:53  sproingie: i am a model of functionality
00:54  gridbag: i deploy context free content.
00:54 @joed: Like svm.
00:55  pantsman: objectivity-oriented programming
00:56  javaPythonSnake: Just used an assertion.
00:57  pantsman: are you asserting that you just asserted?
00:57  javaPythonSnake: hahahahaha
00:59  SJr: Is there a getGUID already in java somewhere that will generate a unique random integer, once and only once, that is thread safe?
00:59  tnzr: is there any way to get HashMap.keySet() to return a SortedSet instead of just a Set?  Or a way to sort a Set? :)
01:00  SJr: Um, isn't that what a TreeMap is for?
01:00  SJr: well not really I suppose.
01:00  tnzr: i dont know, is it?
01:00  tnzr: heh
01:00  tnzr: (for the record I really dont know, I wasnt being sarcastic)
01:00  nafri: hello i'm trying to make a telnet client... i can connect to telnet server on port 23...  and I'm using DataInputStream to read the response from server
01:00  nafri: but I'm getting wierd chars
01:01  sproingie: ~~sJr javadoc UUID
01:01  javabot: sJr: http://is.gd/4VW3P [JDK: java.util.UUID]
01:01  nafri: what should i use to get/read the data from telnet server?
01:01  cythrawll: nafri, those chars are part of the telnet protocol
01:01  cythrawll: pretty sure
01:01  cythrawll: telnet is not as raw as most people tend to believe
01:01  javaPythonSnake: Make sure you don't want duplicates. :)
01:01  cythrawll: read the rfc
01:02  SJr: thanks
01:03  nafri: cythrawll: rfc?
01:03  javaPythonSnake: I've been trying to put a vertical label on a JPanel for 3 hours.
01:03  sproingie: nafri: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc854.html
01:03  gridbag: nafri: telnet is a hairy protocol. download the linux telnet.c client source and take a look at the state machine. it sends across user, environment variables, ttymode, etc.
01:04 @joed: http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/telnet-rfc.html
01:04  sproingie: telnet at its heart is actually a very simple protocol and you don't have to implement all the option negotiation
01:05  sproingie: you do at least have to be aware of the basic sequences and be prepared to ignore them
01:05  Fanook: javaPythonSnake: vertical in what way?
01:06  sproingie: see if you can lay your hands on an open source java mud client.  those should speak telnet quite ably.
01:06  nafri: sproingie: yea but right now I'm just trying to connect to telnet server, when client connect to server it sends back some response to client right...
01:07  javaPythonSnake: from top to bottom, but characters keep their position... Ex:
01:07  javaPythonSnake: 1
01:07  javaPythonSnake: 2
01:07  sproingie: nafri: servers normally shouldn't initiate option negotiation unbidden, but they often do
01:07  nafri: sproingie: and I'm just trying to read that response... I can see that respone on server as i've isntall packet capture there
01:07  sproingie: nafri: you really should read the RFC, it will tell you how it all works
01:07  sproingie: it's not long
01:09  javaPythonSnake: Fanook: I managed to flip the JLabel vertically, but not the individual characters.. #8 being infinity.
01:10  sproingie: nafri: lots of stuff like synch is never ever used anymore, so dont get tied up in it.  the basic idea is if you see \xff in the telnet stream, the next byte is a command, and will determine what you do next
01:11  nafri: sprongie: yea i got you but the thing is i can't receive anything from server.... I can see  server sending commands like (Command: Do Terminal Type).. but i don't receive (can't read) on my application
01:12  nafri: i've also using sniffers at both end to check and I've used default telnet client to see the messaging
01:12  sproingie: nafri: couldn't tell you.  i'd work from an existing telnet client and test against its behavior
01:13  nafri: sproingie: thats what i'm trying to do... should i use DataInputStream to read the data? or is there some other way too?
01:13  sproingie: nafri: doesnt seem like much reason to use DataInputStream over a raw InputStream
01:14  Fanook: javaPythonSnake: you pretty much have to create your own JLabel subclass. See the following for an example of implementation http://en.allexperts.com/q/Java-1046/2010/6/Move-JLabel-angle-1.htm
01:14  sproingie: nafri: telnet is strictly byte-oriented, so DataInputStream doesn't really do much for you
01:14  SJr: What's the best way to resolve a circular dependency?
01:15  ojacobson: SJr: A <--> B can always be turned into A --> C <-- B + A --> B
01:15  SJr: One of the classes is essentially a singleton, except if the application 'restarts' (not fully restarts).
01:15  javaPythonSnake: F....man. Thanks.
01:15  SJr: What is class C?
01:15  SJr: do you have a link with perhaps more detail?
01:15  ojacobson: Something to hold the bits of A that both A and B need to reach
01:16  ojacobson: The basic idea is that a cycle indicates that one of the classes is doing too many things and should be split into two or more classes

01:21  gridbag: SJr : whats the best way to reference a singleton?
01:21  svm_invictvs: gigasoft: Use dependency injection and put it in the singleton scope :P
01:21  svm_invictvs: gridbag: ^^
01:22  antlong: hello, looking at this issue, does anyone have an idea as to what the problem could be. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=931
01:22  gigasoft: svm_invictvs, ?!
01:23  svm_invictvs: ~singleton
01:23  javabot: In most cases singletons should be avoided, they often make non-trivial programs clunky and difficult to maintain.  If you really are considering using a singleton, you should first read http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/co-single.html and http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184401625 before doing so to ensure using a singleton is absolutely, positively necessary.
01:24  svm_invictvs: gigasoft: Those two articles cover it quite well.
01:25  gridbag: gigasoft, I agree.

01:49  SJr: i.e. instead of foo = foo && bar, can I do, foo &&= bar?
01:49  bradg0620: Yes, you can do that
01:49  bradg0620: &=
01:53  javaPythonSnake: You can do that?
01:53  SJr: The Java tutorial lists a &= operator but offers no description
01:54  SJr: I wonder if it's bitwise or not, or whether that matters
01:54  javaPythonSnake: 1 &= 3  are you sure that's not   0011 & 0001
01:54  javaPythonSnake: yeah
01:54  javaPythonSnake: could have just said that lol
01:54  SJr: I was doing it for boolean flags, in a loop.
01:56  javaPythonSnake: mmm. Ask Fanook. Although, if you can do that, it's confusing to read, so don't do it.
01:56  Fanook: ~operators
01:56  javabot: Fanook, operators is http://java.sun.com/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html
01:57  javaPythonSnake: you're right.
01:57  javaPythonSnake: well kind of .
01:58  ojacobson: SJr: & and | are non-short-circuiting AND and OR operators (respectively) for booleans.
01:59  andern: this might be a dumb question, but should you initialize a variable before you use it in the condition of a for/while-loop, or is for (int i = 0; i < methodThatSucksMemory(); i++) totally fine?
01:59  javajon: having trouble with regexp ... can someone please explain why <[pP].*?>(.*?)</[pP]> doesn't match html <p> tags that wrap lines?
01:59  ojacobson: javajon: above and beyond the fact that HTML is not in the class of regular languages, you mean?
01:59  ojacobson: Regular expressions cannot correctly parse HTML.
02:00  javaPythonSnake: You should probably initialize any variable before you use it.
02:00  ioexception: ~htmlparser
02:00  javabot: ioexception, html parsing is best accomplished with one of - NekoHTML @ http://sf.net/projects/nekohtml - HTML Parser @ http://htmlparser.sf.net/ - TagSoup @ http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/ - JTidy @ http://jtidy.sf.net
02:00  ojacobson: andern: There's no magic here. Your method will be called every iteration. If that matters, write your code so that that doesn't happen.
02:00  javajon: ojacobson: i know, i'm just trying to do something thats quick and dirty for content of <p> tags.  If i have: <p ...>...\r\n</p>, that expression won't match it

02:02  javaPythonSnake: 1 &= someNumber is  the bitwise operator.
02:02  nafri: how can i encode a char to ASCII?
02:02  javaPythonSnake: ?
02:03  javaPythonSnake: Not sure of your point
02:03  Fanook: nafri: what makes you think you need to encode it?
02:04  nafri: Fanook: what do u mean?
02:05  Fanook: anything that's a valid ascii char is a valid unicode char with the same numeric value
02:06  ojacobson: Fanook: as a point of style I'd still use the character encoding tools to handle that
02:06  javaPythonSnake: System.out.println((int)'A'); :)
02:06  ojacobson: javaPythonSnake: definitely not.
02:06  ojacobson: nafri: You usually encode whole Strings (or CharBuffer objects).
02:07  ojacobson: You can do that a few ways: String.getBytes(nameOfEncoding), CharSet.encode(), a few others
02:07  Fanook: ojacobson: fair enough. that would at least guarantee you're not trying to encode non-ascii stuff by accident
02:08  ojacobson: Fanook: The "obvious" naive implementation does the wrong thing for code points > 127, too, and it's not obvious by inspection that that's true unless you've implemented it before
02:08  Fanook: stupid sign extension....
02:09  RenatoSilva: this is crazy but has anyone ever compiled bash?
02:10  javajon: ojacobson:  so, setting the DOTALL flag does what i "want", except it includes alot of junk.... what approach do you recommend to simply capture all TEXT-ONLY in <p> tags?  tagsoup/etc. ?
02:10  LtHummus: RenatoSilva: I'm sure someone somewhere has compiled bash at some point.
02:11  javaPythonSnake: Actually my solution would work fine provided you only had one character to cast :))
02:11  javaPythonSnake: Goes to make sure.
02:16  mshaw: RenatoSilva: no, nobody ever has compiled bash
02:16  mshaw: what are you thinking?
02:16  mshaw: it was designed from ground up to be source only
02:16  mshaw: never to be compiled
02:16  mshaw: by anyone
02:16  mshaw: ever
02:23  nafri: ojacobson: i'm trying to read bytes from socket and convert it into string and use ASCII encoding
02:23  ojacobson: You usually decode whole messages at a time
02:24  ojacobson: (whole byte[]s)
02:24  SJr: can anyone think of an instance when your hashCode() should return a constant value?
02:25  Fanook: when you're demonstrating how not to write a hashcode() method
02:25  SJr: I was actually thinking that for NullObjects, it makes sense.
02:26  javaPythonSnake: getBytes(ASCII).. but UTF-8 and ASCII are congruent as he said above.  16bits char
02:26  nafri: ojacobson: int x = stdIn.read(b);
02:27  Fanook: SJr: which makes me question why you would have multiple instances of NullObject
02:27  nafri: String value = new String(b);
02:27  nafri: ojacobson: now i've string
02:27  ojacobson: But under an encoding you don't know about
02:27  ojacobson: pass the name of the encoding, too
02:27  nafri: ojacobson: now i want to use encoding on that strign
02:27  ojacobson: (The system default encoding is almost NEVER 'US-ASCII')
02:27  ojacobson: it's already decoded
02:27  ojacobson: you're too late
02:28  ojacobson: do it when you create the string
02:28  ojacobson: The String constructors that accept a byte[] all decode the byte[] at that point.
02:28  javajon:  ojacobson:  so, setting the DOTALL flag does what i "want", except it includes alot of junk.... what approach do you recommend to simply capture all TEXT-ONLY in <p> tags?  tagsoup/etc. ?
02:28  ojacobson: javajon: any HTML parser; ones that spit out a DOM mean you can use XPath or something like it to find the elements you're interested in, which is nice
02:30  nafri: ojacobson: can please assit me how can i do that... String value = new String(b); this is how i converting byte array to string
02:30  javaPythonSnake: Woah.. Did you know ctrl Shift arrow takes windows across screens. ..
02:30  ojacobson: nafri: Have a look at the javadocs for String.
02:30  ojacobson: Particularly at the list of constructors.
02:34  SJr: Fanook, wouldn't I want to ensure hashCode always returned the same thing, if equals always return true, if the type matches, regardless of whether or not it's a singleton?
02:35  nafri: ojacobson: thanks... another thing is i'm trying to code a telnet client... whenever i connect to server i get this data -> ÿýÿý ÿý#ÿý'
02:35  nafri: ojacobson: i don't know how to decode it
02:35  ojacobson: What sequence of bytes is it?
02:36  nafri: ojacobson: i'm using read()  of DataInputStream to read it
02:36  RenatoSilva: nafri: don't guess, find out
02:36  ojacobson: What sequence of bytes is it?
02:37  nafri: ojacobson: ummm i don't know... what do you mean by that?
02:37  Fanook: SJr: I believe that's the equals/hashcode contract, but why create the extra objects?
02:37  ojacobson: Somewhere at the bottom of your pile of code, there is a sequence of bytes coming in off of the socket's input stream.
02:37  ojacobson: What bytes are producing the output you don't understand?
02:37  RenatoSilva: nafri: he wants the actual bytes sent by the server
02:37  ojacobson: You can find out by printing them out (hex-encoding them may help) or by using something like wireshark to read them before your app sees them
02:38  nafri: ojacobson: yes i'm using wireshark at server to get the data it's -> Command: Do Terminal Type
02:38  ojacobson: There you go, then.
02:38  ojacobson: It's not characters at all.
02:38  nafri: and 3-4 more commands  liek this
02:39  ojacobson: Don't bother trying to look at it as characters. It's part of the telnet control protocol.
02:39  nafri: ojacobson: what should i do then? :) i'm stuck
02:39  ojacobson: Respond appropriately per the Telnet RFC.
02:41  nafri: ojacobson: yes I'm reading that too and they have mentioned command codes in that... but the thing is if 'm not getting actual command then how can i respond back
02:41  ojacobson: That *is* the command.
02:42  ojacobson: You weren't expecting the commands to be strings you can read, were you? That's not what the RFC says.
02:43  mshaw: wait what, computers have commands that you can't read
02:43  mshaw: that's dumb
02:43  mshaw: you know who else's commands we couldn't read?
02:43  mshaw: the nazis
02:43  ojacobson: Realistically, a telnet client should never do any encoding or decoding at all
02:44  ojacobson: bytes 0..254 should be echoed out to stdout as-is and the IAC sequences should be handled invisibly
02:44  ojacobson: (except for the sequence IAC IAC, which should result in byte 255 being output)
02:44  alpha^: I'm writing an app that depends on several 3rd party libs. Is it possible to JAR up all the 3rd party JARs including my app's JAR into one deliverable JAR?
02:44  mshaw: need i mention hitler's involvement in this conspiracy
02:44  ojacobson: similarly, bytes from stdin should be passed straight on to the socket, except for byte FF, which should be doubled (so that it appears as IAC IAC to the remote peer)
02:44  nafri: ojacobson: yea but code is like numbers Code = 35, Code - 42 etc
02:45  ojacobson: nafri: no, it's bytes with those values
02:45  mshaw: wait, wat, bytes aren't numbers?
02:45  ojacobson: or rather bytes with the same representations as those values, since you're going to get a bit kneecapped by sign issues if you try to work with those numbers directly
02:46  javaPythonSnake: alpha you can decompress any jar right?
02:47  mshaw: ~jarjar
02:47  javabot: jarjar is yet another utility to repackage jars and embed them within your distribution. For more information see http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/
02:47  mshaw: there's a better one that someone will spank me with soon enough
02:47  ojacobson: alpha^: possible, but not really very wise
02:48  ojacobson: if you want a "one file" download hand out a JNLP file and let web start download the rest of the JARs
02:48  nafri: ojacobson: even when i try to readByte() i get output like this -> -1 -3 24 -1 -3 32 -1 -3 35... i don't see command codes :(
02:49  alpha^: ojacobson, I don't want to depend on a web download. But I also don't want to specify each JAR in the -cp when I execute my app
02:49  ojacobson: nafri: the RFC was written assuming wire octets would be interpreted as unsigned bytes
02:49  ojacobson: Java uses signed bytes
02:49  ojacobson: what matters is the representation, not the numeric value
02:49  ojacobson: the octet 1111 1111 is represented as 255 in the RFC and as -1 in Java
02:49  ojacobson: alpha^: So put a Class-Path: in your JAR's manifest listing the other JARs it depends on
02:50  ojacobson: then java -jar (or double-clicking on the JAR) will do the right thing
02:50  alpha^: ojacobson, Ah interesting. I'll check that out. Thanks
02:50  lduros: Hi, I'm trying to install tomcat6 to work as target runtime with eclipse on ubuntu 10.10 AMD64 -- does anybody know of a tutorial to set this up? Using tomcat6 library packages won't work with eclipse
02:51  mshaw: doubts
02:52  aTypical: Hello, java people!!
02:52  javaPythonSnake: I can guarantee one thing iduros, if you fire up eclipse with tomcat and pull up Mr.Firefox = unexpected results :p
02:52  mshaw: more doubts
02:53  javaPythonSnake: My attempt at making a java joke..... sorry
02:53  lduros: javaPythonSnake: so what do you advise?
02:53  mshaw: he advises you disregard his previous statements and resort to logic
02:54  lduros: mshaw: I've read threads with many different ways to get it to work but it all seems to fail for me
02:54  javaPythonSnake: heh.
02:54  lduros: mshaw: it's the first time i'm trying to set this up though
02:54  mshaw: that's so weird
02:54  mshaw: how exactly is it failing?
02:55  lduros: Well, if I install tomcat6 with the package manager, then it says some jar are missing when i point to the /usr/share/tomact6 directory, but when using firefox it works well after starting the server
02:55  javaPythonSnake: do an update.
02:55  mshaw: what is 'it'
02:55  mshaw: javaPythonSnake: shhh
02:55  lduros: mshaw: http://localhost:8080 works
02:55  javaPythonSnake: hmph
02:55  ojacobson: javaPythonSnake: it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt
02:56  mshaw: and what jars does it complain it's missing?
02:56  javaPythonSnake: Lol.
02:56  lduros: let me check again
02:56  mshaw: also, what is 'it'?
02:56  ojacobson: Why would you want to use a system-wide installation of a container for development?
02:57  ojacobson: Download tomcat, tell eclipse where you unzipped it, when you get bored, delete the directory and pretend it never happened
02:57  lduros: ojacobson: but then do I have to tweak settings manually?
02:58 * mshaw blinks
02:58  lduros: ojacobson: it's the first time i'm installing tomcat so just trying to get to the point and do some beginner familiarization with the code
02:58  ojacobson: And you're involving Eclipse... why?
02:58  mshaw: is it your first time using java?
02:58  ojacobson: That's a huge extra wall of complexity over "start tomcat"
02:58  ojacobson: Run through the Tomcat readme and get some basic examples up and running by hand before you start trying to get your IDE to play with it
02:59  lduros: ojacobson: it's part of the tutorial
02:59  javaPythonSnake: heh !
02:59  ojacobson: Not the Tomcat one, surely
02:59  mshaw: what is 'the tutorial'
02:59  lduros: a video
02:59  mshaw: so some random 3rd party 'tutorial'
02:59  lduros: ojacobson: i'll go through the tomcat readme
02:59  lduros: mshaw: yeh
03:00  mshaw: that isn't affiliated with any of the technologies it tutorializes
03:00  mshaw: and could be out of date
03:00  javaPythonSnake: I hate eclipse more everyday
03:00  mshaw: that's a good call
03:00  mshaw: eclipse blows
03:00  lduros: well basically it shows how to do it on windows, which is a little more straightforward, i've got this link which tries to solve the issue on ubuntu in many ways: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/447289/problem-creating-a-tomcat-6-server-in-eclipse-form-ubuntu
03:01  mshaw: if you're trying to learn java
03:01  lduros: javaPythonSnake: eclipse makes me love vim
03:01  mshaw: starting with java ee is ill advised
03:01  tjsnell: using eclipse is ill advised
03:01  lduros: tjsnell mshaw: using java is ill advised?
03:01  mshaw: basically everything you're doing is ill advised
03:01  nafri: ojacobson: yea i got it... according to RFC there are code against each command like 24 for Command: Do Terminal Type,  35 for Command: Do Terminal Speed and so on
03:01  mshaw: lduros: sure, if you want to distill to that point
03:02  tjsnell: lduros: I didn't say that
03:02  lduros: mshaw: basically everything you're doing is ill advised >> thanks
03:02  javaPythonSnake: good old text editor.
03:02  lduros: ;-)
03:02  mshaw: lduros: oh, sorry, you made a mistake, i guess you should give up
03:02  nafri: ojacobson: and i'm getting this pattern too but it sends   (-1 -3) between each code ->   -1 -3 24 -1 -3 32 -1 -3 35
03:02  nafri: ojacobson: i don't know what is that
03:02  mshaw: alternatively, we should just tell you didn't make a mistake and tell you how your fanny is special and like no other newbie's fanny we've seen
03:02  ojacobson: nafri: do you understand the difference between a number and the bits that represent it?
03:02  nafri: ojacobson: but anyways i'll figure it out
03:03  lduros: ah well, anyway, thanks for your help
03:03  nafri: ojacobson: not really
03:03  mshaw: lduros: okay, good luck!
03:03  ojacobson: nafri: then you are going to have a very hard time with this.
03:03  ojacobson: That's probably worth learning.
03:04  ojacobson: There are tons of articles about binary representations out there. The important detail is that all of Java's integral primitives (except char) use 2's complement
03:04  nafri: ojacobson: what should i look into?
03:04  javaPythonSnake: Hacker's Delight is a good one..
03:05  mshaw: i crown you king of relevant advice
03:08  nafri: ojacobson: i know what binary representation is but i don't know what you are trying to say here... as 24 32 35 are exact command codes mentioned in RFC of telnet
03:09  ojacobson: I'm telling you that you are seeing command codes that are mentioned in the RFC
03:09  ojacobson: but the representation has changed
03:09  ojacobson: the RFC uses unsigned numbers to represent octets
03:09  ojacobson: java uses signed numbers to represent octets
03:09  ojacobson: therefore the numbers the RFC uses won't always be the same numbers Java would use
03:11  javaPythonSnake: It's like he likes to teach, but waits for victims.
03:12  javaPythonSnake: flip the bits and add one..  :) ..... here it comes  ..
03:12  mshaw: or, understand

03:34  Dragonai: What is wrong with this code?
03:34  Dragonai: http://pastebin.com/VTRbzP0X
03:34  Dragonai: I'm on 1.5 hours of sleep so I'm having trouble figuring it out
03:35  Fanook: the conditions of your for loop look...confused at the very least
03:35  Dragonai: Yeah haha
03:35  Dragonai: I'm sorry for that mess. I'm extremely exhausted
03:35  Dragonai: But I need to get this done
03:35  Dragonai: Tips on fixing?
03:36  Dragonai: I'm new to for loops as well
03:36  Fanook: initialize i to 0 and see what happens
03:36  Fanook: ~loops
03:36  javabot: Fanook, loops is http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html
03:36  Fanook: also read that if possible
03:36  tjsnell: Dragonai: go get some sleep!
03:36  Dragonai: Haha
03:37  tjsnell: my tip is don't procrastinate then expect us to bail you out
03:37  Dragonai: I would but I need to finish this and one more method before I do
03:37  guidj0s: Dragonai: first off, I would recommend that you follow the policy of "returning as soon as possible", to keep the nesting level to a minimum.
03:37  Dragonai: I was assigned this today
03:37  Dragonai: Haha
03:37  Dragonai: Reading the link, one sec
03:38  guidj0s: Dragonai: if (num < 0) { return ""; } // proceed with the instructions to process the string normally, because num > 0
03:39  Dragonai: Yeah I notice the return should've replaced S.o.p haha
03:39  Dragonai: One sec
03:42  c00kiemon5ter: so, how do I go about implementing an 'equals' method ?
03:42 @cheeser: ~equals
03:42  javabot: cheeser, equals is http://leepoint.net/notes-java/data/expressions/22compareobjects.html
03:42  cbeust_: Or let your IDE of choice generate it for you
03:42 * cheeser nods.
03:42 @cheeser: apache commons has helper methods, too.
03:44  robbyoconnor: whoa cbeust_...
03:44  bshacklett: Is it possible to have an Entity Manager find multiple objects without using a query? Similar to em.Find(...)
03:45  mshaw: surprise, that uses a query
03:45  Dragonai: Updated code, still not working and this time I can't find the problem http://pastebin.com/ngY9StN0
03:45  bshacklett: It's an implicit query, though, right?
03:45 @cheeser: bshacklett: no
03:47  bshacklett: Thanks.
03:49  Fanook: Dragonai: define "not working"
03:49  guidj0s: Dragonai: you're still not making an early-enough return and that's making your code horrendous.
03:50 --- cheeser sets modes [##java -b mek||malloc!*@*]
03:50  Fanook: if he does it right, there's no reason to have any if blocks
03:50  Dragonai: Ah
03:50  cbeust_: Yes robbyoconnor ?
03:50  robbyoconnor: nothing -- just didn't expect to see you here.
03:51  robbyoconnor: (follow the blogosphere)
03:51  cbeust_: Nobody expects the... ah well whatever
03:51  guidj0s: Fanook: one "if" test is necessary.
03:51  guidj0s: no "else"s though.
03:51  guidj0s: Dragonai: do you know what "return" does?
03:51  Dragonai: Yeah
03:51  Fanook: guidj0s: no, there's no reason to have any ifs in that method
03:52  guidj0s: Fanook: how do you treat the case when num is less than 0?
03:52  Fanook: the same as any other case
03:53  guidj0s: Fanook: 	if (num < 0) { return ""; }
03:53  Dragonai: I have that there.
03:53  Dragonai: Hmm
03:53  guidj0s: Dragonai: no, you don't.
03:53  Fanook: right, it's unnecessary
03:53  Dragonai: Hmm
03:54  Dragonai: I have it after the if(num > 0)
03:54  Dragonai: one sec
03:54  guidj0s: Dragonai: ...
03:54  Dragonai: I'm sorry guid.
03:55  guidj0s: do you know what "return" does?
03:55  Dragonai: I'm just so screwed up right now
03:55  Dragonai: Under normal circumstances, yes.
03:55  Dragonai: Apparently I don't at the moment
03:55  Dragonai: :<
03:55  ojacobson: Dragonai: you realize 'return' indicates that your method exits, right?
03:55  ojacobson: Returning inside a loop means the loop will only run once (at most) and only up to the return, absent any other conditions
03:55  guidj0s: Dragonai: 8 hours, that's how much sleep you need after every 16-hour period.
03:55  Dragonai: Ah, damn!
03:56  Dragonai: I had no idea
03:56  ojacobson: You don't need any 'if's in this method.
03:56  Fanook: finally! someone else who speaks sense!
03:56  ojacobson: You need a String variable to store the intermediate state and a loop from zero up to num, and a single return at the end of the method.
03:56  ojacobson: The rest is up to you.
03:57  ojacobson: (Actually, there are better ways to do it than a String variable, but that's the easiest one to write. It's also really slow for large values of num, but your prof can tell you more.)
03:58  ojacobson: Fanook: actually, I suppose you could do this with 'if' if you had no loop constructs...
03:58  Dragonai: Alright, I think i comprehend that now, haha, restarting the code.
03:58  Fanook: ojacobson: yes, but why would you bring recursion into this?
03:59  ojacobson: I wasn't going to *say* it!
03:59  ojacobson: Also, I hear a rumour that Java may get language-mandated TCO soon
04:00  bshacklett: Tail Call Optimization?
04:00  Fanook: interesting
04:02  Dragonai: HOLY CRAP I DID IT
04:02  Dragonai: I love you guys, thanks to you I understand for loops now
04:02  Dragonai: http://pastebin.com/e1HWpRCa
04:02  Dragonai: :)
04:03  javaPythonSnake: on to forEach
04:03  Dragonai: Indeed
04:03  Dragonai: Dunno when that'll be, but for now I'll revel in this success
04:03  Dragonai: One more method and I'm off to bed
04:04  javaPythonSnake: You can declare you initial var (counter) within loop header
04:04  Adola: Hello!
04:04  ojacobson: You realize num - (num - 1) is a really complicated way to say '1', right?
04:05  ojacobson: for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) // would be a more conventional way to write that loop
04:05  ojacobson: No magic algebra, no off-by-one bugs
04:05  javaPythonSnake: Wos
04:05  javaPythonSnake: wow*
04:05  Dragonai: Haha yeah
04:05  Dragonai: Whatever.
04:05  Dragonai: I'll fix that
04:05  Dragonai: Thanks
04:05  Adola: Hello everyone.  I posted in 'Dream.in.Code' earlier, but no-one has helped yet, so I thought I'd take a more direct approach.  Can anyone help me with Recursively multiplying matrices?  (It's a homework assignment, and I'm having a really hard time with it)
04:05  bshacklett: Also, take care to use meaningful identifiers.
04:05  Adola: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/197293-recursively-multiply-matricies/page__p__1153144__fromsearch__1&#entry1153144
04:05  Adola: (That's the link to my post...)
04:06  bshacklett: "what" isn't very meaningful :-\
04:06  Dragonai: true
04:06  Dragonai: I typically name my variables variations of "dude" to mess with my teacher
04:06  javaPythonSnake: heh
04:06  bshacklett: Wow...
04:07  ojacobson: Your first real job is going to be a shock, then
04:07  Dragonai: I don't do it for conventional programs.
04:07  ojacobson: build good habits now, while it's easy
04:07  Dragonai: Haha
04:07  Dragonai: One of my last programs had dude, dudebro, dudebroseph, dudebrosephalopod, dudebrosephalopodacity
04:07  ojacobson: The point of stupid exercises is to make it easy to do them well
04:07  Dragonai: That's true
04:08  Dragonai: I'll typically give my variables indicative names, stupid names like those are just a pain to type out anyway
04:08  bshacklett: Try to write your code so that your grandmother could figure it out given enough time.
04:08  Dragonai: Hah
04:08  javaPythonSnake: kinda funny, but not funny enough to continue to write dudebrosephalopodacity more than once :p
04:08  Dragonai: exactly
04:08 * Adola shuffles. 
04:09  bshacklett: Got to give you some points for that, though. It made me smile :)
04:09  Dragonai: Haha
04:12  Adola: So...
04:12  Adola: Anyone not too busy ^.^

04:19  Dragonai: Hmm
04:19  Dragonai: How would I "do it right"?
04:20  Fanook: javaPythonSnake: if you do the looping correctly, you can guarantee you never output a comma without something after it
04:20 * Dragonai looks at code
04:20  javaPythonSnake: I don't know what Fanook has up his sleeve. He's a crafty bastard, but..... Now I'm thinking Fanook has some hack and I have to think further :p stand by
04:21 --- Channel ##java was synced in 123 seconds
04:21  racines: Question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047323/per-pixel-collision-using-getrgb-of-a-bufferedimage-java2d-api
04:21  Fanook: nothing crafty, just intelligent usage of a for loop
04:22  javaPythonSnake: I was thinking while not last number
04:22  robbyoconnor: Fanook is good -- i'll give hm that
04:22  Fanook: that's the other way to do it
04:22  Dragonai: Fanook IS a badass.
04:23  Dragonai: We haven't learned while yet, and when we haven't learned something she doesn't want us using it
04:23  Dragonai: So
04:23  Dragonai: yeah
04:23  Dragonai: >.>
04:23  Dragonai: I just nested an if in the for
04:23  Dragonai: stand by
04:24  javaPythonSnake: now I"m slightly curious, not enough to really think about it, but slightly.. :)
04:25  Dragonai: Same haha
04:25  Dragonai: Wtf?
04:25  javaPythonSnake: Ok, I'll code it out see if Fanook does the same thing.
04:26  racines: Question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047323/per-pixel-collision-using-getrgb-of-a-bufferedimage-java2d-api No one has answered it there so I thought I'd come here and see if you guys know how to do it
04:26  javaPythonSnake: My range printer will have a chat client attached to it.
04:26  racines: It's about per-pixel collisions using getRGB(x,y)
04:26  Dragonai: Not compiling because this isn't a statement? String final = "[";
04:27  javaPythonSnake: final is a keyword
04:27  Dragonai: ohhhh
04:27  Dragonai: Dudebro isn't a keyword
04:27 * Dragonai edits
04:28  echosystm: hi guys, ive got a bit of a curly problem i need some help with
04:28  javaPythonSnake: wonder's what a curly problem is.
04:28  echosystm: my system has "Devices" and each device has a "Port"
04:28  Dragonai: lol
04:28  racines: So does anyone know how to solve my per-pixel-collision problem?
04:28  echosystm: every time either a device or a port changes, that change needs to be logged
04:29  Dragonai: Wtf, I hear the Adult Swim music
04:29  javaPythonSnake: video game?
04:29  Dragonai: And my 5 year old sister is watching TB
04:29  Dragonai: TV*
04:29  Dragonai: Crap
04:29  racines: Yes python, it is a video game
04:29  Dragonai: Brb, turning that off haha
04:29  racines: It's a platformer, read the link again: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047323/per-pixel-collision-using-getrgb-of-a-bufferedimage-java2d-api
04:29  echosystm: how might this be modelled in objects that can be persisted to SQL over JPA ?
04:29  racines: But that is not part of the problem, the problem is per-pixel collisions
04:30  javaPythonSnake: hey Dragonai what is the quick trick w/netbeans for s.out.print?
04:30  javaPythonSnake: stout?
04:30  echosystm: rebuilding the relationships between the DeviceLog and the PortLog is tricky
04:31  echosystm: from what i can tell, one method would be to use an intermediate table, associating one device log to certain port logs
04:31  echosystm: alternatively, i could scrap an intermediate table entirely and just use the dates to reconstruct the association
04:32  echosystm: but that would take some temporal functions on the database that i doubt JPA would like
04:32  javaPythonSnake: nobody knows.. ?
04:32  racines: PythonSnake, I'm wondering the same thing about MY question >_>
04:32  javaPythonSnake: looks at your question .
04:33  echosystm: http://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&source=hp&biw=840&bih=842&q=netbeans+System.out.println+shortcut&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=bee3fae64f2e33ca
04:33  Dragonai: I'm getting a "return types do not match" when I try to return the final string
04:33  echosystm: javaPythonSnake: see above
04:33  racines: Dragonai, realise that "final" is a keyword and may not be used as a variable.
04:33  Dragonai: I changed it to dudebro
04:33  echosystm: also, #netbeans is not #java
04:33  javaPythonSnake: I would use a bitmask to weed out the pixs you're looking for
04:34  Dragonai: There's something else wrong here, i weeded out the keywords
04:34  racines: There isn't an easy way to implement a bitmask in Java 2D it seems
04:34  racines: So I'm having to use the getRGB() function
04:34  Dragonai: Oh wait, I think I got it
04:35  Dragonai: Nope
04:35  javaPythonSnake: I don't know enought about that kind of thing to be of any real help to you, but I think that's the approach I would take.
04:35  Dragonai: Still nothing
04:36  xPhilosx: if a daemon thread "A" spawns thread B and I set A = null, will that kill thread B?
04:36 @cheeser: ~tias
04:36  javabot: Try it and see. You learn much more by experimentation than by asking without having even tried.
04:36  Dragonai: ~return
04:36  javabot: Don't press return until you've finished typing your question, it's annoying to see multiple lines for one question, and hard to follow.
04:36  javaPythonSnake: Why is System.out.print(""); an error in netbeans
04:36  racines: That would depend on what the error is
04:37  javaPythonSnake: very true.
04:37  racines: NullPointer Exception I'm assuming?
04:37  Dragonai: http://pastebin.com/f0HjHZHd
04:37  javaPythonSnake: no....
04:38  javaPythonSnake: Netbeans just sucks.
04:38  Dragonai: I'm getting this: Error: The parameters and/or return type you have declared for your method printRange do not match those specified in the problem statement.
04:38 * Dragonai sighs
04:39  javaPythonSnake: mmm.
04:39  Fanook: Dragonai: where does it say that method should return anything?
04:39  Xinux: Resources for learning java?
04:40  Fanook: ~first cup
04:40  javabot: A friendly web page to get you started with Java programming: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/
04:40  racines: Xinux, google
04:40  Fanook: ~bibles
04:40  javabot: Get these: 1) Sun Java Tutorial (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial)  2) Bruce Eckel's "Thinking in Java" (http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ) (Get the 3rd edition, the 4th is only freely available up to chapter 7.)
04:40  Dragonai: I've tried print
04:40  javaPythonSnake: pretty close.
04:40  Xinux: racines: Does google give opinions? Don't assume I haven't googled it.
04:40  Fanook: Dragonai: System.out.print
04:40  Dragonai: I tried it
04:40  whaley: ~bibles
04:40  javabot: Get these: 1) Sun Java Tutorial (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial)  2) Bruce Eckel's "Thinking in Java" (http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ) (Get the 3rd edition, the 4th is only freely available up to chapter 7.)
04:40  Xinux: Fanook: Thank you
04:40  Dragonai: Eh I'll try again, one sec
04:40  whaley: Xinux: ^
04:41  Xinux: whaley: Yes, thank you :)
04:41  racines: Xinux there is no way in hell google did not help you find simple Java tutorials
04:41  whaley: i'm not a fan of eckel's book, personally.  but others like it
04:41  javaPythonSnake: Oracles sight has become increasingly more convoluted
04:41  Fanook: whaley: I'm kinda surprised that factoid still tells people to get the horribly out-of-date free version
04:41  Xinux: racines: Oh it did :P
04:41  Dragonai: Yep, nothing
04:42  Dragonai: Now it tells me my method has to return a value
04:42  Fanook: Dragonai: again, why did you define your method to return a String?
04:42  javaPythonSnake: I don't see a main method .
04:42  racines: It must return a string
04:42  whaley: Fanook: I don't know that it matters as I'm sure Eckel is still devoting pages to stupid shit like teaching the overriding of finalize()
04:42  Dragonai: The other method I wrote was similar and did that
04:43  Fanook: Dragonai: yes, but READ the requirements. That method had to return a string. This method just prints
04:43  javaPythonSnake: access modifier-->  public return type -->  String      method name-->printRange  (parameters)  { }
04:43  Dragonai: But when I replace it with s.o.p nothing happens
04:43  javaPythonSnake: disreguard that lol
04:43  Dragonai: lol
04:44  Fanook: no, javaPythonSnake's got the right idea
04:44  racines: Dragonai, just a hint for your second for loop, you need to have the condition be:  for(i = first; i <= second; i--)
04:44  Fanook: your method is defined to return a String. The requirements do not specify that
04:44  javaPythonSnake: yeah but looking at is confusing.
04:44  racines: change it to this: for(i = first; i >= second; i--)
04:44  Dragonai: Oh yeah
04:44  Dragonai: My bad
04:44  Fanook: racines: what if they pass the args in the opposite order?
04:45  guidj0s: Fanook: absolute value.
04:45  Fanook: guidj0s: congrats, you just failed. Check the sample output.
04:46  Dragonai: Still nothing
04:46  guidj0s: Fanook: what did I fail?
04:46  Dragonai: What the heck is wrong :<
04:46  Fanook: Dragonai: pastebin your latest attempt
04:47  Dragonai: http://pastebin.com/PPGHXiKU
04:47  Fanook: Dragonai: again, the error tells you your method has the wrong return type. Change It.
04:48  Dragonai: What should it return?
04:48  Dragonai: I've tried return and s.o.p
04:48  Dragonai: to no avail
04:48  javaPythonSnake: what does that mean
04:48  javaPythonSnake: ohh.
04:48  Fanook: s.o.p has nothing to do with the return type of your method
04:48  javaPythonSnake: print is not a return
04:48  Dragonai: yeah
04:48  javaPythonSnake: just b/c it's printing to screen hehe
04:48  Fanook: if a method shouldn't return anything, define the method as returning void
04:49  javaPythonSnake: What does the caller of your method receive back from the method .
04:49  xPhilosx: cheeser, thanks for making me do that
04:50 @cheeser: all better?
04:50  Dragonai: Okay, I changed it to void
04:50  Dragonai: and removed all returns
04:50  Dragonai: the return*
04:51  Dragonai: one sec
04:51  cbeust_: Dragonai: try to do it with one for loop, more fun thisway
04:51  Dragonai: I just want to fix this and sleep
04:51  Dragonai: Time for fun later
04:51  Dragonai: :P
04:52  Dragonai: http://i.imgur.com/kQieq.png
04:52  Dragonai: I'm sitting here wtf'ing at this
04:52  racines: Dragonai, http://pastebin.com/MPayLcms
04:53  racines: I've best fit it to your needs. Look over and see how I did it.
04:53  racines: Also try doing what cbeust suggested and use one for loop.
04:53  Dragonai: Hmm
04:54  javaPythonSnake: your test here.. Are you numbers suppose to run through that range ? so  if  (11, 19)  >> 11,  12, 13....19?
04:54  cbeust_: Only do one for loop if you want an A though
04:55  racines: Mhm
04:55  Fanook: or a very confused TA
04:55  Dragonai: Haha
04:55  Dragonai: I'll stick with two for now
04:55  Dragonai: And yes, it needs to run that range
04:56  javaPythonSnake: why does test one fail?
04:56  racines: Dragonai did you get it working?
04:56  Dragonai: Exactly!
04:56  javaPythonSnake: are you suppose to go from 7- 2
04:56  javaPythonSnake: ?
04:56  Dragonai: racines, it's outputting everything correctly but I see a red < under each output
04:57  Dragonai: Look at the image
04:57  Dragonai: http://i.imgur.com/kQieq.png
04:57  racines: I have no idea what that is
04:57  javaPythonSnake: what are the < >
04:57  racines: What am I looking at here>?
04:57  Dragonai: I really should turn off that TV, otherwise my sister will be cussing out her kindergarten class tomorrow, brb
04:57  Fanook: what's with the lcl in all your output?
04:57  javaPythonSnake: did you code them in?
04:57  Fanook: or 1c1, or whatever that is
04:58  xPhilosx: cheeser, yeah, I was able to learn a bit more by actually running it, thanks
04:58  Fanook: oh wait, that's diff
04:58  racines: Dragonai you posted that link before I gave my solution
04:58  racines: Use the solution I posted and post it again
04:58  javaPythonSnake: why do these fail?
04:59  javaPythonSnake: give me the directions donkey
04:59  Fanook: Dragonai: your program isn't outputting anything. Why is that?
05:00  Dragonai: One sec
05:00  javaPythonSnake: Don't name a class Main
05:00  racines: It's just a test case
05:00  Fanook: naw, that's fine. It's an incredibly poor naming choice, but perfectly legal
05:01  javaPythonSnake: I don't know.. I mean I'd call that a bad habbit... I know some IDE's do it.
05:01  Dragonai: Testing racines' program
05:01  Dragonai: one se
05:01  Dragonai: sec*
05:01  racines: Does anyone think they can solve my per-pixel solution? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047323/per-pixel-collision-using-getrgb-of-a-bufferedimage-java2d-api
05:02  Dragonai: I forgot to mention I'm doing stuff on Practice-It and it doesn't accept full classes
05:02  Dragonai: "You submitted a complete class. Most of Practice-It's problems ask you to submit only a method, NOT an entire class/program. Remove the class header and submit only the method or code that was asked for."
05:02  racines: Then do that......?
05:02  Dragonai: I am
05:02  racines: The method is right there
05:03  Dragonai: I know
05:03  javaPythonSnake: wow they pointed you for that
05:03  Dragonai: I isolated it and am recompiling
05:03  Dragonai: Haha
05:03  Dragonai: Yep, same error I got.
05:03  Dragonai: Return types do not match.
05:03  Dragonai: expected return type: void
05:03  Dragonai: your return type was: class java.lang.String
05:03  Dragonai: :(
05:03  racines: I have no idea what this Practice-It thing is
05:03  Fanook: a way to avoid paying for TAs
05:03  racines: But it is indeed doing what it's supposed to
05:04  racines: It's definitly printing the range.
05:04  javaPythonSnake: concatenation is expensive :) .... StringBuilder no worries.
05:04  racines: definitely*
05:04  Dragonai: I am fully aware that both of our methods should output correctly
05:04  racines: I have no idea what: "Practice-It" is
05:04  Dragonai: Know what? I give up. I'll take this to her tomorrow and point it out, she's an understanding person and will help me fix it
05:04  Dragonai: Thanks for all your efforts
05:05  racines: Theres nothing wrong with the code.
05:05  Dragonai: Practice-It: http://webster.cs.washington.edu:8080/practiceit/
05:05  Dragonai: It's pretty sweet for this kind of stuff
05:05  Dragonai: I owe you all something, hold on
05:05  racines: lol
05:08  javaPythonSnake:  thiis present taking a long time. Better be good.
05:09  javaPythonSnake: Fanook: gotta minute?
05:09  Fanook: i suppose
05:10  racines: Oh good then you can help me with my problem :)
05:10  racines: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4047323/per-pixel-collision-using-getrgb-of-a-bufferedimage-java2d-api
05:10  Fanook: oh noes! it was a trap!
05:10  javaPythonSnake: best described with a screen shot....
05:10  Dragonai: http://drop.io/jrcl4k5
05:10  Dragonai: pass is "concatenation" without quotes
05:10  Dragonai: a demo of a track I'm working on
05:10  Dragonai: good night all o/
05:11  Dragonai: The tentative plan for that track is a boss battle track for a friend's game
05:12  Dragonai: Anyway, see you all later
05:12  javaPythonSnake: Fanook:  screenshot upload?
05:12  Dragonai: Feel free to drop me a memo if you want to give constructive criticism
05:12  javaPythonSnake: url
05:12  javaPythonSnake: YOU SCK
05:12  javaPythonSnake: :p
05:13  Fanook: racines: getRGB returns an int containing the ARGB value of the pixel. Mask out the part you care about and check it
05:13  javaPythonSnake: Thats' what I said.
05:13  javaPythonSnake: Hey Fanook: do you know where I can upload a screen shot?
05:13  cbeust_: imgur.com
05:18  javaPythonSnake: Fanook: http://imgur.com/D3Ngz.png
05:19  javaPythonSnake: so if I do this.
05:19  javaPythonSnake: ...
05:20  Fanook: GridLayout
05:21  javaPythonSnake: used it .
05:21  mshaw: javaPythonSnake: my dying mother loved gnu chess
05:21  mshaw: how come?
05:21  javaPythonSnake: just a min.. Preparing my 7 hour battle lol.
05:22  mshaw: mom might not have that kind of time
05:22  mshaw: i just want to make her happy
05:24  javaPythonSnake: sorry...getting there.
05:25  javaPythonSnake: http://imgur.com/Y8R2D.png
05:26  mshaw: should mum choose black or white
05:27  mshaw: where does the advantage lie
05:27  javaPythonSnake: to be brief I guess the quetion is: I'm using borderlayout     4 panels(N S E W)  + board(center).... But unless manually maximize, get the half board..
05:28  javaPythonSnake: I'll fool around w/it.. mshaw, I have no idea what you're talking about.
05:28  Fanook: i'd have to see the code responsible for building the board
05:29  mshaw: i just want mum to be happy
05:30  cbeust_: White is an advantage
05:30  javaPythonSnake: It's pretty ugly right now, I was wondering maybe I was missing something about how borderLayout works ..
05:30  Fanook: it's possible. More likely you've just screwed up your build order and/or panel placement
05:32  javaPythonSnake: build order.... Ok... never really learned swing properly..
05:47 --- Maro__ is now known as Maro|Away
05:49  xPhilosx: is there a built in process/ preferred way for expanding array[][] to make room for more data, because the only way I can think of is O(n^2), using 2 for loops.
05:54  Fanook: no. Arrays are fixed-size. Try using Lists instead
06:01  xPhilosx: Fanook, of course arrays are a fixed size, but you can expand an array by creating a temp array and then copying the array and making a new array with a larger size
06:01  xPhilosx: I am fairly sure that ArrayList may do something similar, as it increases size by 50%ish
06:02  Fanook: that's not expanding an array, that's replacing it with a larger one. using Lists shoves that mess out of sight
06:02  xPhilosx: ah, ok
06:05  xPhilosx: Fanook, can you have a "multidimensional" list though, like array[][] can?
06:05  xPhilosx: Fanook, thats the basic reason why I'm not just using ArrayList
06:05  mshaw: no ways a list could contain a list bro
06:05  Fanook: no, you'd have a List<List<Foo>>, but you really don't have a multidimensional array either
06:06  neuro_sys: do you think every method in a project should have a description comment?
06:06  xPhilosx: Fanook, true, an array of arrays
06:07  xPhilosx: mshaw, too bad, that would save me the time of creating a custom array object
06:11  javaPythonSnake: Fanook: If adding component to a frame, internal in this case. If using BorderLayout and I add a component to the West, will adding a component to the center cause the two components to snuggle?
06:13  poseidon: I have to unsorted arrays.  What would be the best way to see if they contain the same amount of the same objects (even if they are in different orders)?
06:14  guidj0s: poseidon: your classmate was here earlier.
06:14  javaPythonSnake: Didn't you ask this yesterday
06:14  ojacobson: poseidon: weird. Someone else was in here earlier asking the exact same thing. You may want to check the ~logs.
06:15  poseidon: Sorry, I asked that.  I was told to put both into a map, then test the maps.  However, I must implement the algorithm myself
06:15  guidj0s: and you've been told to do it in java?
06:15  javaPythonSnake: put the array elements into a map
06:15  poseidon: guidj0s: Yes
06:16  javaPythonSnake: Just create two index and iterate over one while check with the other... so one stops the other goes.. the other goes the other stops..
06:16  xPhilosx: poseidon, what school do you attend?
06:16  javaPythonSnake: That is probably what your teacher is looking for you to do.
06:16  ojacobson: poseidon: #11929 First ask yourself `How would I do this without a computer?'  Then have the computer do it the same way.
06:17  javaPythonSnake: You could use sugar packets as each bucket :)
06:18  Planck_: If the objects are all unequal, dumping them into a Set and testing for set equality would work.  Otherwise it requires more than 1 simple line.
06:19  ojacobson: Planck_: not so
06:19  ojacobson: that would cause [a, b, b] and [a, b] to compare equal, which he doesn't want (" if they contain the same amount of the same objects")
06:20  Planck_: Sorry, I miswrote.  If the array entries are all unequal.
06:20  guidj0s: poseidon: sounds like someone's trying to teach you introduction to computer sciences using Java.
06:20  javaPythonSnake: Oh that's is why you said map
06:20  poseidon: guidj0s: yes.  Is there something wrong with that?
06:21  Planck_: It would also fail for [a, b, c] if b.equals(c)
06:22  poseidon: there will be cases where b.equals(c) returns true.
06:22  xPhilosx: very weird: int size = array.length[0] + Math.round(array.length[0] / 2) works but int size = array.length[0] + Math.round(array.length[0] * .5) does not.  Math.round returns an int, so its interesting to see that it requires a cast to (int) simply because you use .5.  Not really a question, just a statement of interest.
06:22  ojacobson: Planck_: if [a, b, c] and [a, b, b] can be distinguished but b.equals(c), your program has a bug
06:22  ojacobson: the point of equals is generally that equal objects should be interchangeable without modifying the semantics of the program as a whole
06:22  guidj0s: poseidon: that is controversial, but my opinion is that yes, familiarity with something closer to machine language would be a better choice for such a course.
06:22  javaPythonSnake: .        no nothing wrong.. But I"m thinking this is the intro to searching and sorting and ridding of duplicates by set is probably not what they're looking for.
06:23  ojacobson: (That's a very fuzzy guideline, obviously)
06:23  Planck_: ojacobson: Ah, I misinterpreted your statement.  I thought by [a, b, b] you meant that there was an object b referenced twice in the the array.  No worries though, I think we both understand where the problems will be :)
06:23  guidj0s: poseidon: basically because the higher a language's level, the more abstract it is, and the less you have to actually understand what is going on behind the english-mnemonical instructions you write.
06:23  ojacobson: xPhilosx: The difference has to do with the widening promotions used, which in turn affect *which* overload of Math.round gets used
06:24  ojacobson: also, if 'array' is a variable of an array type, array.length[0] is nonsensical
06:24  xPhilosx: meh, array[0].length
06:24  xPhilosx: type-o
06:24  ojacobson: xPhilosx: a.length / 2 is an expression whose type is int
06:25  ojacobson: which will be widened to float for the call to Math.round (which is completely spurious; there's nothing to round, as the result is an integer anyways)
06:25  xPhilosx: ahh
06:25  ojacobson: whereas 0.5 is a double, which means a.length * 0.5 is a double, which means you get the double overload of Math.round
06:25  xPhilosx: a decimal implies double or float
06:25  ojacobson: double.
06:25  ojacobson: If you want a float, you have to say so.
06:25  xPhilosx: ojacobson, okay
06:26  ojacobson: 0.5f is a float. 0.5 is a double.
06:26  xPhilosx: ojacobson, that makes more sense now.  Its interesting to learn about the inner workings of Java.  I suppose in the long wrong it will help you code more efficiently and correctly.
06:33  bitreader: Hi, I'm having this weird problem. I'm creating an array of objects, and whenever I try to initialize one of the variables of any of the objects, I'm getting a java.lang.NullPointerException. Yet, I don't have enough experience to know how to deal with this exception. Could anyone give me some help to be able to handle this out?
06:33  bitreader: Thanks in advance.
06:33  mshaw: don't store null values in your array
06:34  guidj0s: bitreader: did you call the constructor for the elements the variables of which you're trying to initialize?
06:34  mshaw: NPE means you're calling a method on something that's null
06:34  mshaw: figure out what
06:34  mshaw: and don't do it
06:34  bitreader: Well I'm not. At least not deliberately. I think the null values are being pointed to by the variables in the array automaticly when java  creates the objects.
06:34  Planck_: bitreader: using "new MyObject[100]" creates an array of 100 *references* to MyObject, which are all initially null.
06:34  javaPythonSnake: sorry ary  about that poseidon. didn't mean to paste all that.
06:34  mshaw: bitreader: java doesn't 'create the object'
06:35  ojacobson: new expressions always create exactly one object (plus any work done in that object's constructor)
06:35  ojacobson: in the case of new Foo[], the 'one object' is the array itself
06:45  javaPythonSnake: ojacobson: familiar with layouts? Swing components?
06:46  freeone3000: The Swing components in the JDK do only create themselves.
06:46  freeone3000: It's generally recognized as safe to create Swing components off the JDK, even.
06:47  javaPythonSnake: What?
06:48  freeone3000: Err, off the EDT.
06:56  RedXIII: How can I list what exception types a method can throw?
06:57  pfn: throws E1, E2, E3, etc.
06:57  RedXIII: er. rephrase. How can I list what exception types a method throws **
06:58  pfn: in what?
06:58  RedXIII: rephrase try#3. I have a library I load packages from. There was no inclusive docs. How can I find out what exceptions a particular method can throw?
06:58  javaPythonSnake: Are you asking how to catch multiple exceptions with one method?
06:58  pfn: RedXIII, javap
06:58  RedXIII: ah
06:59  javaPythonSnake: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/
07:00  deebo: checked exceptions are told, if theyre unchecked, you have to go through the code if there is no proper documentation
07:06  Xinux: Slix`: Hola :)
07:06  Slix`: Hi.
07:07  RedXIII: =/ I think I'm doing it wrong.
07:07  RedXIII: I navigated a windows command prompt to the location where a lib is located and ran (for example) "javap org.apache.ibatis.session"
07:07  RedXIII: It says it couldn't find anything.
07:09  Slix`: RedXIII: I know you.
07:09  javaPythonSnake: some exceptions are checked exceptions, meaning you must catch them or a compilation error will occur. Other such errors, like a null pointer exception are not checked.
07:10  RedXIII: Slix`: That's slightly disturbing?
07:10  RedXIII: javaPythonSnake: Is it normal that javap would not output anything at all?
07:11  javaPythonSnake: I have got to get rid of this wireless mouse..
07:11  javaPythonSnake: I trying to disassemble a class file?
07:12  javaPythonSnake: I don't know what you're trying to do. Print ?
07:12  RedXIII: trying to disassemble a jar file
07:12  RedXIII: to locate what exceptions it throws
07:13  javaPythonSnake: exceptions a jar file throws?
07:13  RedXIII: well, a specific class
07:13  RedXIII: I have some library that doesn't supply docs (or at least I can't find it), and I want to find out what exceptions it throws
07:14  javaPythonSnake: I"m looking at the commands.
07:16  selckin: RedXIII: did you include the -classpath or is it not a jar?
07:17  RedXIII: selckin: Its a .jar, and I tried with and without -classpath
07:18  javaPythonSnake: javap -c Test1
07:18  RedXIII: o-o?
07:18  RedXIII: for example
07:18  RedXIII: E:\Libraries>javap org.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSessionFactory
07:18  RedXIII: ERROR:Could not find org.apache.ibatis.session.SqlSessionFactory
07:19  RedXIII: yields ^
07:19  RedXIII: just testing using iBatis.
07:19  noisewaterphd: RedXIII: just catch Exception, and then print it. that way you can move on with life, and down the road you will have your answer
07:20  javaPythonSnake: Good idea
07:20  RedXIII: I thought it was bad practice to just use Exception
07:20  selckin: it is
07:20  javaPythonSnake: Depends
07:20  javaPythonSnake: Not always a bad practice
07:20  selckin: RedXIII: so 8 lines of you saying you ignored my suggestion of -classpath the.jar ?
07:21  RedXIII: -[ 01:17.29 ]- -( RedXIII ): selckin: Its a .jar, and I tried with and without -classpath
07:21  javaPythonSnake: http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javap.html
07:21  RedXIII: -[ 01:17.29 ]- -( RedXIII ): selckin: Its a .jar, and I tried with and without -classpath
07:21  selckin: and then you copy pasted the wrong command
07:22  selckin: as evidence that it still doesn't work
07:22  selckin: so bye.
07:22  RedXIII: I didn't think it was necessary to paste every command variation I attempted at
07:23  selckin: i say you need a classpath so you show one without to see if it's correct, smart
07:23  RedXIII: without and with display the same error as above
07:24  RedXIII: assuming that the classpath directory is valid and the class loaded is also valid
07:24  RedXIII: I guess I'll just catch exception. Bad practice can take another one for the team.
07:24  selckin: see that sentance is probbaly wrong
07:24  selckin: since you point it to a jar not a directory
07:26  RedXIII: I had also tried pointing it to the .jar file I was loading from, again, same result.
07:26  javaPythonSnake: Its not always a bad practice.
07:26  selckin: well nobody can help you with vagueness, so i'm off
07:27  javaPythonSnake: me?
07:27  javaPythonSnake: gn
07:28  xPhilosx: does anyone know the search algorithm that ArrayList uses?  I'd implement binary, but my array isn't sorted.
07:29  javaPythonSnake: binary
07:31  freeone3000: xPhilosx: Linear.
07:32  xPhilosx: ah, ok
07:32  xPhilosx: thakns
07:32  xPhilosx: *thanks even
07:32  javaPythonSnake: in Arrays class?
07:36  freeone3000: Binary search isn't valid for unsorted data.
07:36  javaPythonSnake: gp
07:40  xPhilosx: perhaps ill just use a hash map
07:46  bitreader: Could anyone provide with a link that explains the use of tokens like these: \n, \b, \x... and so on and so forth.
07:47  bitreader: Haven't been able to find any on google. (fail)
07:47  Planck_: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html
07:49  Planck_: If you're planning to learn Java, you will want a copy of the Java Language Specification.
07:58  amitz: overkill?
08:03  exobyte: is the Map.Entry set method thread-safe?  you'd think it isn't, but the code in AbstractMap.SimpleEntry code is V result = value; value = object; return result;
08:04  exobyte: it's like it would be if the value were volatile
08:05  amitz: pure guessing but i thought thread safeness depends on the implementing classes? in term of collection?
08:06  exobyte: amitz: Yes, but HashMap doesn't implement its own Map.Entry, it uses AbstractMap's SimpleEntry
08:06  exobyte: or not...
08:06  exobyte: actually, I don't think *it* even knows

08:44  iksik: hello
08:44  iksik: is any one using software from atlassian mabe ?
08:46  dangertools: ~anyone
08:46  javabot: Chances are someone has, so why not just ask your question and save some time?  If someone knows and wants/has time to help, perhaps he/she will.
08:48  iksik: uhm ;]
08:49  AMcBain: and, to qualify:
08:49  AMcBain: ~tech support
08:49  javabot: Hello, ##java is not a technical support channel for your Java apps or virtual machines, it is a development enthusiast channel which prefers to receive questions and discussion on the topic of programming with the Java language.  Please consider seeking help with the vendor of your software if you can't figure out how to use it.
08:49  Planck_: Maybe that *was* the question?  Some weird form of market research.
08:49  AMcBain: Doesn't make it any more on topic ;)
08:49  Planck_: True
08:50  Planck_: "How would I write a Java program to poll IRC users about use of some company's product" might be more on topic.
08:51  iksik: well it's a combination of spring (?) + tomcat, i'm not java developer, but the problem is, to set it up with custom suburi - /crowd is by default, and i want to make it works under /dev/crowd - with no luck... and as far as i readed on google ( or atlassian docs ), the thing is to properly setup a web server - don't know ;/ should i ask on #tomcat?
08:52  soa2ii: Hej, I program with MySQL. Now I just created a netbeans project and everything runs fine. But how do I deploy this application later? As a jar-File of course but what do I have to do with the mysql.jar?
08:52  deebo: its a commercial product
08:52  deebo: if you didnt buy support.. well
08:52  deebo: go buy support
08:52  iksik: deebo, support for tomcat? or what? o.O
08:53  deebo: whatever atlassian software you are using
08:53  iksik: uhm, then ie. #tomcat have no idea about context path base urls? it depends only on app?
08:54  AMcBain: soa2ii, you need to inclulde all external JARs your program needs on the class-path.
08:54  iksik: as far as i can see, spring can manage only urls AFTER base path - nothing more, then it's not related with application
08:54  AMcBain: soa2ii, For most purposes, this can be set in the manifest for the JAR file, using a relative path to some place outside that JAR.
08:55  AMcBain: This means it must be bundled with your application or the users would otherwise have to have a copy.
08:55  freeone3000: iksik: context-root is set by your application container.
08:55  xPhilosx: are both E and Object generic or is E the only generic one?
08:55  soa2ii: AMcBain: Ah, okej. Can I specify this classpath via Commandline too?
08:55  AMcBain: soa2ii, There are programs to mangle your JAR and do JARs within JARs if you want only a single distribution JAR.
08:55  freeone3000: xPhilosx: Depends on how they're declared. java.lang.Object isn't generic, no.
08:55  iksik: freeone3000, uhm
08:55  AMcBain: soa2ii, sure!
08:55  freeone3000: soa2ii: Yes, but it's mutually exclusive with -jar
08:55  soa2ii: great
08:55  xPhilosx: freeone3000, thanks
08:55  AMcBain: soa2ii, -cp , but do note that if you supply a classpath in the JAR's manifest, -cp wins.
08:56  AMcBain: if you also*
08:56  soa2ii: AMcBain: I would just have to enter the mysql.jar
08:56  freeone3000: AMcBain: Other way around. If -jar is supplied, -cp is ignored.
08:56  soa2ii: Ah, okej.
08:57  AMcBain: freeone3000, er, yeah, wait? no ... erk.
08:57  AMcBain: I haven't really used -cp with -jar in a while, you can tell :P
08:57  AMcBain: I prefer the manifest.
08:57  AMcBain: soa2ii, if you do want to do -cp, you can do "java -cp yourjar.jar;mysql.jar package.to.main.class..."
08:57  soa2ii: The Problem: I'm not sure if you're allowed to bundle the mysql.jar with you app and I'm no sure eithere where the client will have it ...
08:58  soa2ii: AMcBain: Ah, that's fine too.
08:58  AMcBain: Do note that the ";" is for Windows, ":" is for *NIX
08:58  AMcBain: as path separators.
08:58  soa2ii: : then ;)
08:58  soa2ii: Yeah
08:59  AMcBain: A shell file or a JNLP file can be used as a launcher at this point if you wish so you don't have to go to the command line to get this.
08:59  soa2ii: okej, then I'll propably create some kind of svn hook to checkput and build the app
08:59  freeone3000: soa2ii: That's based on the license. It's GPL, so sure, as long as your application is also GPL.
08:59  soa2ii: I would have to check this with my chef.
08:59  freeone3000: Well, I mean, as long as you're fine with releasing the source code of your application in perpetuity...
08:59  freeone3000: For no charge...
09:00  soa2ii: That's not in my decision
09:00  AMcBain: so are you the souchef, then?
09:00  AMcBain: (sp)
09:00  freeone3000: *sous chef.
09:01  AMcBain: I knew I probably forgot a letter :P
09:01  soa2ii: sous chef?
09:01  freeone3000: An assistant to a chef.
09:01  soa2ii: lol, nope :P
09:01  soa2ii: I just have to fix what others did horribly wrong :P
09:02  freeone3000: The word you were trying to say is spelled "chief", but we usually have "boss" or "manager" instead.
09:02  soa2ii: chief, yeah :P
09:02  soa2ii: then boss ;)
09:03  sayyestolife: I have a (subclassed) JComponent which contains a JTextField and another (subclassed) JComponent. The issue is that I'd like to have the (secondly mentioned) subclass to be outside the normal swing hierarchy.

09:04  sayyestolife: Because I'd like to have it to be able to paint over all other components
09:04  freeone3000: Why wouldn't a component be able to paint over other components?
09:04  AMcBain: You mean like Jackson Pollock?
09:05  sayyestolife: freeone3000, it's kind of hard to explain. I'll draw a picture..

09:09  sayyestolife: AMcBain, yea

09:10  sayyestolife: hmm, but the thing is that I have a JComponent containing the TextField and my special component
09:11  sayyestolife: (and I'd like to keep it that way)
09:11  sayyestolife: and also my special component is dependent on the position the jtextfield
09:11  freeone3000: You could use the AWT z-order bug to your advantage.
09:11  sayyestolife: :o
09:11  staar2: hello
09:11  freeone3000: AWT heavyweight components are always painted on top of Swing components.
09:12  sayyestolife: okay?
09:13  freeone3000: So if you make the thing you want to be on top an AWT component instead of a Swing component, it'll paint on top.
09:13  staar2: what would be best object for storing the lap times ? long ?
09:18  Planck_: What precision and range do you need?
09:20  sayyestolife: freeone3000, it works, but isn't really that nice is it? :/
09:22  freeone3000: sayyestolife: No, the proper way to do it would be a JLayeredPane.
09:22  sayyestolife: hmm, but will that paint over ANY other gui component?
09:23  freeone3000: Any lightweight component, yes.
09:24  Wizard: hi

09:47 @pr3d4t0r: mxmueller: If you want to get it from Oracle, though, you can't.  They require you to pass the interactive web form for the TOS.
09:47 @pr3d4t0r: mxmueller: I never installed from apt-get either (I prefer installing binaries from Oracle) and they might have a Y/N prompt somewhere in there too for installation.

10:04  term_: I was wondering if this is a decent way to open/close files
10:04  freeone3000: term_: Nope.
10:04  sktrdie: <%="Boom"%> works, but <% System.out.println("BOOM"); %> doesn't
10:04  term_: can you tell me what's wrong with it?
10:04  sktrdie: why?
10:04  freeone3000: ~resource management
10:04  javabot: proper resource management is easy to get right - see http://dmlloyd.blogspot.com/2008/07/proper-resource-management.html for more information. Or, even better, just use Project Lombok (projectlombok.org); then @Cleanup FileOutputStream fos = ....; is all you need. Type ~lombok for more info.
10:05  term_: I mean if I'm forced to use the scanner clas
10:05  freeone3000: sktrdie: Because the output stream for Tomcat isn't System.out.
10:05  freeone3000: term_: Works the same. See above.
10:06  freeone3000: term_: Basically, there's nothing enforcing that the file *is* closed. A finally { } block, however, is always run.
10:06  sktrdie: freeone3000: which is output in tomcat then?
10:07  freeone3000: sktrdie: HttpServletResponse.getOutput(), which is shortened to "out" in JSPs.
10:08  sktrdie:   out("Hello"); ?
10:08  freeone3000: <% out.println("Hello"); %>
10:09  freeone3000: Though remember that, unless you set Content-Type, it's assumed to be HTML, and thus, newlines are ignored.
10:09  sktrdie: freeone3000: thanks
10:09  KeiKurono: morning
10:10  sktrdie: freeone3000: since you're here, do you know of a way to deploy .war files to my tomcat to see the changes without restarting?
10:11  freeone3000: There should be a "redeploy" command. On glassfish, it's "asadmin redeploy App", which takes only half the time of a server restart.
10:12  sktrdie: freeone3000: ok, 1 last note. I have a bug where apparently this file isn't being included... how would you debug this?
10:12  sktrdie: it's not outputting any errors
10:12  term_: freeone, because file.close() by itself doesn't puke if the file didn't actually close?
10:14  freeone3000: term_: That's not the point. The point is that you can possibly open a file without closing it.
10:14 --- Cain` is now known as Cain
10:14  freeone3000: term_: Even if doFileStuff() worked as intended, what happens if they give an "open" call without a matched "close"?
10:16  term_: well, I wouldn't?
10:16  term_: It's not intended for anyone else.
10:17  freeone3000: Right. *you* could possibly open a file without closing it.
10:17  infi: defensive programming and sanity checking for yourself (e.g. in 6 months when you want to change this code) is almost as important as sanity checking for others.
10:17  freeone3000: Which is why we have that nice resource management pattern up there, which is a lot harder to mess up, and Lombok. Though Lombok's more invasive, and I haven't yet tried it with OpenJDK.
10:18  term_: try/finally seems simple enough
10:18  term_: I mainly came here becausee that code gives compile errors
10:19  term_: namely cannot find symbol
10:19  infi: you mistyped the method name.
10:19  freeone3000: Nope. Lexical scoping strikes again.
10:20  infi: but more important, listen to freeone3000: you're basically saying "I don't want to write a robust class."
10:20  freeone3000: Basically, when you close a code block (with '}'), variables declared in that code block are not visible outside of that block.
10:21  term_: so I can't create a scanner object from another method?
10:21  term_: (inside main for instance)
10:22  term_: static scanner inFile ... didn't work
10:22  term_: so
10:22  freeone3000: You can, you just have to pass the variable around.
10:22  tjololo: If I have an objact that I write to an bytestream and then make a copy by reading the bytestream. Is the object serilizable?
10:22  freeone3000: ~scope
10:22  javabot: "A variable's scope is the region of a program within which the variable can be referred to by its simple name" - http://bioportal.weizmann.ac.il/course/prog2/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/scope.html  Also see http://mindprod.com/jgloss/scope.html
10:22  term_: I'm very lost
10:23  freeone3000: tjololo: If you're using ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, you hope so. If you're using something like JAXB or XStream, it matters less.
10:23  tjololo: I'm using this as a test: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-serialtest.html
10:24  tjololo: but yes I'm using Object Input/Output Stream
10:24  freeone3000: Well, that's *one* way to test. The other way is simply to check if it implements Serializable.
10:25  sayyestolife: Err. Isn't it possible to have a JFrame and then add a JWindow to that frame?
10:25  tjololo: well I know my objects do, but that is no guarantee..
10:25  freeone3000: sayyestolife: No, because JFrame and JWindow are top-level components.
10:25  freeone3000: tjololo: You can do a runtime typecheck with 'instanceof'.
10:25  sayyestolife: I see. Thank you!
10:26  freeone3000: tjololo: However, ObjectOutputStream already performs this check, so you're best off just writing the objects.
10:26  tjololo: Im testing that the values inside the copyed object is equal to the original...
10:26  freeone3000: ..Why would you test that?
10:27  freeone3000: Essentially, that's a test of Java serialization.
10:27  tjololo: I just wanted to make sure that there was no crazy java magic going on
10:28  freeone3000: The serialization *is* the crazy java magic.
10:28  tjololo: hehe
10:28  tjololo: so if there is no IOException thrown then the object should be serilizable, right?
10:29  freeone3000: NotSerializableException is reserved for this case, but it's a subclass of IOException, so yes.
10:31  tjololo: so the baboon at work witch is saying that he is loosing his sso session because my code is not serilizable have to look for a new explanation?
10:32  freeone3000: If your code implements serializable.
10:32  freeone3000: He probably loses his SSO session due to more mundane means, such as timeout.
10:32  tjololo: it does and the object from my code cast no error while going throug the stream...
10:33  term_: ok just one more question then I will stop bothering ;p
10:33  term_: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=43502
10:33  term_: This works when line 19 is commented out
10:33  tjololo: brb going for a walk, might kick someones teeth in but hey, it's friday he might be lucky!
10:33  freeone3000: Right. Because it doesn't attempt to access an item not defined in that scope.
10:33  freeone3000: Where is inFile defined?
10:34  term_: right, in the if block
10:34  term_: so, can I make infile public somehow?
10:34  freeone3000: What?
10:35  freeone3000: Are you trying to make Java have functional scoping?
10:35  freeone3000: Just move it outside of the if statement.
10:35  term_: you're saying the else block can't do anything with infile because it's defined in the if block, right?
10:35  freeone3000: Right.
10:35  term_: ok but I only want to define it when "open" is passed in
10:35  freeone3000: Okay, so what do you want to call "close()" on when the variable isn't defined?
10:37  term_: I understand, the spec says to use methods to do everything.
10:37  term_: I'm going to go to sleep
10:37  term_: thanks very much for your help.
10:38  term_: otherwise I would just create the scanner object in main do my stuff and close it in main as well
10:39  term_: I thought since open comes first it is getting defined so it will still be around to call close on it
10:39  term_: this is poor logic?
10:40  f3ew: Is there a stat(2) equivalent in Java?
10:40  term_: or is the compile error because java is saying if close passed first there would be no infile to close?
10:41  freeone3000: term_: The problem is that there's no variable to call close() *on*.
10:41  FauxFaux: f3ew: And what is that, exactly?
10:41  FauxFaux: Oh, stat.  Utter reading fail.  f3ew: The "File" class has a few methods on.
10:42  freeone3000: term_: Reference definition is not the same as object creation.
10:42  term_: So what you're saying is from main I can never do anything with infile because it only lives in that if block
10:43  term_: the way it's written currently
10:43  freeone3000: Right.
10:43  freeone3000: However, functions can return objects.
10:43  term_: I see.
10:46  f3ew: FauxFaux File.stat() doesn't appear to exist
10:47  freeone3000: No, but getSize() does.
10:47  freeone3000: *length(), rather.
10:47  soa2ii: What's wrong with this command: java -cp /path/to/lib.jar /path/to/Class [args] : it says: could not find MainClass
10:47  FauxFaux: soa2ii: It wants the name of the class, not the path to it.
10:48  soa2ii: FauxFaux: But it is deep in some package structure
10:48  FauxFaux: Yeah.  com.package.of.MainClass.
10:48  soa2ii: Ah, with dots ...
10:48  soa2ii: wait
10:50  soa2ii: FauxFaux: Hm. What's wrong with: java -cp /usr/share/jdbc-mysql/lib/jdbc-mysql.jar de.tudortmund.cs.ls7.davizimporter.Main /opt/home/alebrahim/cronjob_data/
10:50  soa2ii: ?
10:51  freeone3000: soa2ii: Your class isn't in jdbc-mysql.jar
10:52  soa2ii: freeone3000: No, it's not
10:52  soa2ii: It's in de/ ...
10:52  soa2ii: So I have to add this to the classpath as well?
10:52  freeone3000: soa2ii: Your classpath doesn't include .
10:52  soa2ii: Ah :)
10:52  Ron_: hello, any commonly used/recommended/well known sql parser in java? I don't need anything complex, mostly just to identify where the variables are and change their values.
10:52  freeone3000: Packages need to be directories relative to the classpath.
10:53  soa2ii: Now it works :)
10:53  soa2ii: Thanks
10:53  Ron_: oops :)
10:56  Planck_: I don't know anything about SQL parsers in Java beyond what Google reveals.
10:56  Planck_: E.g. that Derby obviously has one, and there's an antlr grammar, etc
10:57  Ron_: I came across the antlr thing, but I'm not entirely sure how to use it.
10:57  Ron_: there are a few parsers out there, but it's difficult to say which is better and which has a stable user base

14:05  nikre: jottinger, i'll see the result of this but would it suffice that i add the hashmap entries to a treemap?
14:08  SDave: is it still considered a good idea to use JDBC, where there are ORMs and EJBs available?
14:10  mapreduce: Yes.
14:10  nikre: I wrote "Treemap<String,Integer> tm = new TreeMap<String,Integer>(oldHashMap);" but when I traverse the treemap with an iterator, the output is sorted according to keys. How can i have the output sorted according to values?
14:11  nikre: custom iterator?
14:11  mapreduce: nikre: Swap the key and value around.
14:11  nikre: not one to one
14:11 @jottinger: nikre: well, the ENTRIES?
14:11  nikre: hmm, that would work actually
14:11  mapreduce: TreeMap<Integer, List<String>>

14:17  nikre: mapreduce, the hashmap is <String,Integer>
14:17 @jottinger: nikre: think about it. mapreduce and I both gave you simple solutions. You're spending more time thinking about it than it would take to code something.

14:23 @jottinger: right, and?
14:23  sktrdie: however the struts.jar is in the classpath
14:23  sktrdie: so i'm not sure why it's not finding it :(
14:24 @jottinger: maybe it's not finding a dependency. Or maybe - just maybe - you're setting classpath explicitly and expecting a servlet container to use the shell's classpath.
14:25  sktrdie: i'm using java -cp ~/etc/etc execjar
14:25 @jottinger: right. That sounds so much like you're not running a servlet container.
14:25  sktrdie: hrm, but this exec.jar should be standalone i believe
14:25 @jottinger: really?
14:25 @jottinger: Why?
14:26  sktrdie: it just executes some things
14:26 @jottinger: uh huh
14:26  sktrdie: ?
14:26 * mshaw blinks
14:26 * sktrdie is confused
14:26 @jottinger: sktrdie: look, did you write this?
14:27  mshaw: how comes you need a web framework to run a standalone, non-web application
14:27  sktrdie: jottinger: i did not in fact
14:27  mapreduce: mshaw: It's not a standalone non-web application.  See 'servlet' in the name.
14:27 @jottinger: who did?
14:27  sktrdie: the developers can't help me, they use eclipse with a tons of plugins and they say it works for them (and excpect to not write any documentation)
14:27  mshaw: mapreduce: 09:27 < sktrdie> hrm, but this exec.jar should be standalone i believe
14:28 @jottinger: sktrdie: then yes, they can help you, because that's their freaking job.
14:28  mshaw: mapreduce: 09:28 < sktrdie> it just executes some things
14:28  mapreduce: mshaw: Let's go with the more reliable evidence, namely, the name.
14:28  sktrdie: what?
14:28  mapreduce: Feck, all I want to do is use the motorway, why do I need a car?
14:28  mshaw: the name is 'exec.jar'
14:28  sktrdie: it's not really, but go ahead.
14:28  mapreduce: mshaw: No, the name of the main class.
14:29 @jottinger: sktrdie: "developers." Their job is... what? to deliver something that doesn't run?
14:29 @jottinger: I want THAT job. I could do that all day. In my sleep.
14:29  sktrdie: jottinger: it runs they say
14:29 @jottinger: not if you can't run it.
14:29  sktrdie: with their development environment.
14:29  sktrdie: (eclipse etc, which i hate)
14:29 @jottinger: again: not if you can't run it.
14:33 @jottinger: sktrdie: the bottom line: your developers, whoever and whatever they are, are ripping you off.
14:34 @jottinger: If they're students, then they fail. (If you're their teacher, YOU fail. Please stop.)
14:34  mshaw: pls fail2fail
14:35  sktrdie: jottinger: but they developed the thing and are ok with themselves
14:36  nikre: mapreduce, writing a custom comparator class ended up to be the easiest. thx
14:36 @jottinger: sktrdie: they still suck.
14:36  mapreduce: sktrdie: Usually people develop stuff to be used by others.
14:36  mapreduce: Not always.
14:37  mapreduce: If they're developing it to be used by you, and you're not going to be writing code, then they need to make sure it works for users.
14:38  sktrdie: i'm a developer as well
14:38 @jottinger: then YOU fail.
14:38  sktrdie: (not java)
14:38 @jottinger: jeezly crow. Why are you morons using java if you don't know anything about java?
14:39  sktrdie: what makes you thing that they don't know how to write Java?
14:39  sktrdie: the lack of documentation?
14:39 @jottinger: let's see.
14:39 @jottinger: "They don't know how to tell me to run it outside of eclipse."
14:39 @jottinger: (paraphrased.)
14:40  mapreduce: Even I know how to tell him to run it outside of eclipse.
14:41 @jottinger: yeah, rocket surgery it ain't.
14:41  sktrdie: so writing things in Eclipse makes you a moron?
14:41  mshaw: no, writing software that somehow has a dependency on your IDE to run makes you a moron.
14:41  sktrdie: exactly
14:41 @tjsnell: eclipse is the ide of choice for morons
14:41  sktrdie: that's what i think, and they're all like... you'll use an ide as well
14:42  HerrBlume: tjsnell: isn't that emacs?
14:42 @tjsnell: that's not and ide
14:42  HerrBlume: some think it is
14:42 @jottinger: plus, using emacs usually means you're unable to, like, exit the editor if you're a moron
14:42 @tjsnell: some think the earth is flat
14:42 @jottinger: sktrdie: hahaha
14:42  neumaennl: tjsnell: so what IDE do you use?
14:43 @jottinger: sktrdie: please stop, it's too early
14:43 @tjsnell: ~idea
14:43  javabot: tjsnell, idea is an open source Java IDE that has free and non-free versions. The commercial edition has been held in very high regard by most professional Java coders who aren't invested professionally in other IDEs. See http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
14:43  mapreduce: jottinger: I don't understand, why would you exit emacs?
14:43 @jottinger: mapreduce: :)
14:44 --- sanchaz is now known as sanchaz-away

14:44  neumaennl: mapreduce: I don't understand, why would you start emacs?
14:44  mapreduce: neumaennl: I don't remember why I started it.

14:45  HerrBlume: and intellij is very userfriendly
14:46  HerrBlume: slime, anyone?
14:46 --- shz-away is now known as sanchaz2
14:46  mapreduce: I've already eaten, thanks.
14:46 @jottinger: tjsnell: our channel's broken. Time to fix it yet?
14:46 @tjsnell: it's beyond repair
14:47  mapreduce: slime is a nice environment.  I especially like the idea of stopping when an exception happens so that the developer can have a poke around and find a way to continue.
14:47  mshaw: i bought some new pants
14:48  HerrBlume: mapreduce: but no refactoring stuff...
14:48  simion314: hi, i want to do some cleanup when the application crashes, i am using a socket and i am  geting some exception, after the app crashes i have to reboot to be able to open again the port
14:48 * mshaw giggles
14:48  mshaw: wat
14:48  simion314: i use threads also
14:48  HerrBlume: simion314: close the socket in the finally block
14:49  mshaw: why does the application crash because you got an exception, and why is it 'some exception' instead of 'SomeSpecificException'
14:49  mapreduce: simion314: If a program exits and you are not on a broken OS, the resources should be returned automatically.
14:50  simion314: HerrBlume: but where i put the try catch, i can't put it around main() , and i want to clean the code after any possible cause of rashing, maybe i will create a bug later
14:50  mshaw: wait, what
14:51  mapreduce: I hate it when my code rashes.
14:51  mapreduce: simion314: It sounds like you've already created your quota of bugs.
14:51  mshaw: simion314: why not write code that doesn't crash
14:51  sktrdie: I have this Main.class file. I try to run it using java org.sgrp.singer.Main, and get a  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sgrp.singer.Main
14:51  sktrdie: what's the issue
14:51  mshaw: java can't find the class org.sgrp.singer.Main
14:51  simion314: mapreduce: in .net i had to use a event or overide some method that is runed awhen the app crashes, nothing of that in hava?
14:52  mshaw: sktrdie: because it's not on the classpath
14:52  HerrBlume: simion314: do you debug in and ide
14:52  sktrdie: mshaw: it is :/ it's the one i'm executing
14:52  mshaw: no, it isn't
14:52  sktrdie: why not
14:52  mshaw: why do you think, why not?
14:52  sktrdie: becuase Main.class is the file i'm executing and it contains a class Main{
14:53  HerrBlume: simion314: are you sure the jvm exited?
14:53  mapreduce: simion314: It's not necessary, because the OS cleans up resources after the app exits, whether it crashes or not.
14:53  simion314: i use an IDE, then my ap crashes, i find the bug , i fix it, then i can't start it again because it sees that port open ,and i have to reboot
14:53  sktrdie: mshaw: and i'm setting -cp .
14:53  mapreduce: simion314: What IDE is this?
14:53  HerrBlume: simion314: maybe have an running debug session running
14:53  simion314: eclipse, is it possible that only one thread crashes and the main method runs  still?
14:54  Kneta_: is there a way in java to truncate numbers easily? Lets say I have a number 0.23499340834 and I only want 8 decimalnumbers?
14:54  mapreduce: DecimalFormat
14:54  Kneta_: thanks
14:54  mapreduce: simion314: What makes you think it's crashed?
14:54  simion314: i wanted to know how to handle any unexpected exceptions, it could happen to anyone and you could log them in afile and the user culd send them to you
14:54  HerrBlume: simion314: maybe some thread should set to daemon?
14:55  simion314: mapreduce: i see the stacktrace in te eclipse console
14:55  mapreduce: simion314: That's an exception, not a crash.
14:55  mapreduce: simion314: What are the 1st and 2nd lines that Eclipse shows you?
14:56 @jottinger: sktrdie: the real problem is that you're clueless and should learn java, as should your developers.
14:56  mapreduce: (or the whole lot into a pastebin)
14:56  sktrdie: jottinger: why not help me? Main.class was generated from Main.java which has public class Main {...so why does it throw java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError ?
14:56  simion314: mapreduce: i fixed the bug already, i wanted to now how to do it for the next possible one
14:57 @jottinger: sktrdie: because... it... can't... find... a... class.
14:57 @jottinger: "It says it can't find a class, why is that?" hmm.
14:57  simion314: i think i will put the enire main contents in a try catch , and put the run() in the thread in a try catch, i will read more about threads and exceptions
14:57  sktrdie: but it's defined in Main.java... did the compiler remove it?
14:58 @jottinger: sktrdie: which class did it say it couldn't find?
14:58  simion314: i can't se the app in the task manager to kill it so i assumed it was crashed
14:58  HerrBlume: simion314: and close the socket in the finally block
14:58  mapreduce: simion314: Look in the Processes tab.
14:58  sktrdie: jottinger: org/sgrp/singer/Main
14:58  mapreduce: simion314: Generally you can't ahead-of-time prevent every possible exception, so just look at the output and fix each as you see it.
14:58 @jottinger: it said it couldn't find org/sgrp/singer/Main? Literally?
14:59  sktrdie: jottinger: Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sgrp.singer.Main
14:59 @jottinger: heh
14:59  sktrdie: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/sgrp/singer/Main
14:59  mapreduce: simion314: Do not place things in a try..catch just to swallow unknown problems.
14:59 @jottinger: sounds like a classpath error! Which would be caused by someone not knowing java at all!
14:59  mapreduce: Otherwise you'll swallow useful information leading to more visible problems.
14:59  sktrdie: jottinger: i have tried everything! i've added -cp .
14:59  sktrdie: what is there that I should know?
15:00  mapreduce: The square root of 4096.
15:00 @jottinger: you may have added to the classpath, but you don't know what the classpath is.
15:00  simion314: mapreduce: then i should search a way to run code when my app crashes, it could work great on my pc and crash on other user pc, so a log file could be important
15:01  simion314: i have done such a thing when i was using .net
15:01  mapreduce: simion314: Now you're talking.
15:01  sktrdie: jottinger: i do know what it is... what makes you think i do not?
15:01  mapreduce: simion314: You can make System.out go to a file, for example.
15:01  mapreduce: And System.err.
15:01 @jottinger: the fact that you're asking the question.
15:02  sktrdie: jottinger: wouldn't it be easier to tell me the solution (if you know how to fix this issue)
15:02  mapreduce: simion314: Either within your program (System.setErr) or outside it (java -jar yourprogram.jar >out 2>err
15:02  mapreduce: )
15:02 @jottinger: sktrdie: sure. But far less fun for me.
15:02  sktrdie: i hate you! :(
15:02 @jottinger: I don't get any remuneration of any kind from helping a moron who thinks he knows it all.
15:02 @jottinger: ~be jottinger
15:02  javabot: Darn you to the potholes of heck!
15:03  mapreduce: I don't know about heck, but Appleton Thorn has a lot of potholes.
15:03 @jottinger: besides, if I help you past this trivial, anyone-who-learns-java-knows-this problem, all you'll do is run into it again, because you won't learn.
15:03  sktrdie: then can you help me learn it?
15:03  sktrdie: send me a reference
15:03 @jottinger: ~classpath
15:03  javabot: The classpath tells Java or the compiler in which jar files and folders to look for classes and resources. Use the -cp/-classpath run-time options to specify the classpath (does NOT work with -jar!). Also see http://is.gd/j4gM [sun.com] for more info.

15:04  sktrdie: already know that, i suppoe
15:04 @jottinger: sktrdie: hint: the classpath tells it where to START looking for resources.
15:04 @jottinger: Really?
15:04 @jottinger: Yet you ask why it says "can't find foo.bar.Baz..." verrrrrrry interesting.
15:04  Kneta_: I'm trying to use DecimalFormat to truncate numbers with lots of decimals. I would like the truncation to basically "cut" the number after 8 decimals. But if I use new DecimalFormat("0.00000000") it rounds the last number :/ So for example 0.12346789 becomes 0.12345679 rahter than 0.12345678. Anyone how I can come around this problem?
15:04  mapreduce: Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) is the world.s most complete, open and integrated business software and hardware systems company.
15:04  mapreduce: Aww, they're so modest.
15:04  sktrdie: ah jee
15:04  sktrdie: hrm
15:04  sktrdie: fuck ok maybe i know
15:05  sktrdie: i gotta give it the org/ location?
15:05 @jottinger: let me guess: you put the directory that had Main.class in the classpath and not the directory that held org?
15:05 @jottinger: sktrdie: hmm, I wonder
15:05  mapreduce: sktrdie: If you point it at org/ it will look in org/org/foo/Bar if you try to use org.foo.Bar
15:05  mapreduce: (notice the double org)
15:06  sktrdie: ok, thanks
15:06  sktrdie: :/
15:07 @jottinger: gee, if only you understood the classpath... one of the most basic java concepts.
15:07  sktrdie: ok, but what about jars :D
15:07 @jottinger: gee, if only you understood the classpath... one of the most basic java concepts.
15:10  amitz: jottinger: perhaps we need to think out a short but powerful analogy to explain classpath.
15:10  amitz: so many classpath related questions -_-
15:12 @jottinger: or maybe we need to have a url that explains the classpath concisely, for morons.
15:13  mshaw: we should write some kind of java 'tutorial' that you could read to learn about it
15:13 @jottinger: hmm
15:14  Haegin: hi, do java File object support moving from one nfs share to another?
15:15  Agbeladem: Hi everybody, I'm having an external issue
15:15  Agbeladem: Let's say I have a main package, let's call it pack
15:15  Agbeladem: On the same folder that pack, I'll put a folder called resources which contains images and files
15:16  Agbeladem: what's the best way to access theses resources from the classes of pack ?
15:16  mshaw: assuming whatever folder pack and resources is in is on the classpath
15:16  mshaw: through the classloader
15:17  Agbeladem: okay but what if I intend to put the entire pack package in a .jar later
15:17  Agbeladem: and I want the resources to remain external
15:17  topriddy: hi...
15:18  mshaw: Agbeladem: then you have exactly the same options available to you
15:18  mshaw: read them as files, with relative or qualified paths
15:18  mshaw: or load them from a classloader
15:18  topriddy: i got a question as regards parsing xml or json results generated by another app...I would have to definitely study results and create a TemplateClass to use to marshal and unmarshal objects?
15:19  Agbeladem: mshaw: but will the relative paths work inside a JAR ? Considering the resources aren't in the JAR
15:19  mshaw: they aren't relative to the jar
15:19  mshaw: they're relative to a working directory
15:19  mshaw: just like everywhere else
15:20  Agbeladem: see, that's the point, if I make an installer of my application or anything, how and where do I specify the user's working directory ?
15:20  ojacobson: You don't.
15:20  ojacobson: The user does.
15:21  Agbeladem: I don't get that, what will the new InputStream() or anything look like ? I get I won't be using getClass().getResource(), so I'll be using the ClassLoader
15:21  mshaw: Agbeladem: this problem is not java-centric
15:21  Agbeladem: well there aren't jar in any other languages, are they ?
15:21  mshaw: getClass().getResource() IS using the classloader
15:22  Agbeladem: oh
15:22  topriddy: jottinger: hi
15:22  mshaw: and the jar has nothing to do with this
15:22  Haegin: argh, apparently file.renameTo(File dest) doesn't work accross multiple partitions. Fail.
15:22  Agbeladem: so.. how will I call the working directory inside the getResource method ?
15:22  ojacobson: Haegin: of course it doesn't.
15:22  mshaw: the working directory is irrelevant if you're loading files with the classloader
15:22  mapreduce: Agbeladem: You don't.  Working directories are unrelated to resources.
15:22  Haegin: ojacobson: of course? why of course?
15:22  mapreduce: Working directories are related to files, not resources.
15:23  Agbeladem: hmm, well I have file resources
15:23  mapreduce: Jar contents are not files.
15:23  ojacobson: Rename is explicitly documented as only working within a single filesystem. Further, renameTo usually maps to the OS's underlying rename tools, which guarantee atomicity -- provided the source and target are in the same FS.
15:23  ojacobson: To "move" a file to another FS is considerably more complex than moving a file within the same FS.
15:23  Haegin: ojacobson: also is there a way to move files across partitions in java without using Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("mv"...);
15:23  mapreduce: Otherwise we'd call them directories instead of jars.
15:23  Agbeladem: mapreduce: true, but my resources are external to the jar so they ARE files, right ?
15:23  mshaw: Agbeladem: correct, but alternatively they could be resources
15:23  ojacobson: Haegin: mv does different things when you mv a file between FSes than when it mv's a file within the same fs.
15:24  topriddy: rephrasing question: do i have to necessarily  create TemplateClass to conform to a json or xml...
15:24  mshaw: if that directoy is on the classpath
15:24  Agbeladem: Yes but I want to keep them outside
15:24 * mshaw sighs
15:24  Haegin: ojacobson: yeah, I was expecting Java to do the same sort of things
15:24  ojacobson: mv within the same fs is link(f, new_path); unlink(old_path);
15:24  ojacobson: Nope.
15:24  Agbeladem: mshaw: hmm
15:24  ojacobson: That call pattern is exactly what renameTo does.
15:24  mshaw: Agbeladem: you have two options
15:24  mapreduce: Agbeladem: If they're loaded via Class.getResource they're resources, and Class.getResource only looks within the jars and directories mentioned on the classpath.
15:24  mshaw: they haven't changed
15:24  ojacobson: (And *all* that it does, for predictability. It's not a user-facing API.)
15:24  mapreduce: If they're loaded by, say, new FileInputStream(name) they're files.
15:24  Agbeladem: I see
15:25  Haegin: so I'm going to have to call mv then? darn. I probably shouldn't have even used java for this it seems.
15:25  ojacobson: Well, or do what mv does
15:25  ojacobson: when moving between FSes, copy the file.
15:25  ojacobson: Then delete the original.
15:25  Agbeladem: however, if I call getClass().getResource(), it's basically from the class' directory that I'm accessing it right ? So how could the path be absolute ?
15:25  mshaw: Agbeladem: CLASSPATH
15:25  mshaw: learn it
15:25  mshaw: ~~ Agbeladem classpath
15:25  tomeo: Hi
15:25  javabot: Agbeladem, The classpath tells Java or the compiler in which jar files and folders to look for classes and resources. Use the -cp/-classpath run-time options to specify the classpath (does NOT work with -jar!). Also see http://is.gd/j4gM [sun.com] for more info. If you're on windows see: http://is.gd/9qq26 [sun.com].
15:25  Agbeladem: haha well..
15:26  Agbeladem: I thought that getResource() of Class was always relative to the class, I'm sorry
15:26  mapreduce: Agbeladem: If your class is, say, foo.bar.Baz, then Baz.class.getResource("blah.txt") will look for foo/bar/blah.txt
15:26  mapreduce: Agbeladem: If your class is, say, foo.bar.Baz, then Baz.class.getResource("/blah.txt") will look for /blah.txt
15:26  Haegin: ojacobson: is that using FileReaders and FileWriters?
15:26  mapreduce: where / is the roots of your classpath, not your filesystem.
15:26  ojacobson: No, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream or FileChannels
15:26  Agbeladem: now I get you ! thanks mapreduce
15:27  tomeo: Im looking for a data type that will suit well for random access of the data, but doesnt store the data in like an array which would have a lot of blank spaces. Any suggestions?
15:27  Haegin: ojacobson: ok, thanks
15:27  mapreduce: ojacobson: What were we talking about yesterday?
15:27  Agbeladem: What if they are different folders in the classpath ? It'll look at them one by one ?
15:27  mapreduce: I was going to reply this morning but you were gone.
15:27  mapreduce: Ah, int foo()[]{..}
15:29  Agbeladem: is that right ?
15:29  retif: i have problems with concurrency. i have a singleton with ArrayList<MyOjb> property and two methods: addObj and boolean isThereObjByParam(param). i have a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException in isThereObjByParam on for statement, i have googled and there are few solutions: use locks or use synchronized statement or use Vector collection type, what are you advice me to use?
15:29  mapreduce: Agbeladem: It will search all classpath entries, yes.
15:29  Agbeladem: and take the first one that has a matching resource with this path, right ?
15:30  mapreduce: retif: CopyOnWriteArrayList or a defensive copy.
15:30  mapreduce: retif: Does this happen every time?
15:30  _W_: retif, solution: don't make it a singleton
15:31  _W_: but yes, if it's still concurrently accessed, what mapreduce said
15:31  retif: mapreduce: exeption thrown from time to time
15:31  Agbeladem: Okay anyway, thanks a bunch maproduce, ojacobson and mshaw
15:32  HerrBlume: who needs singeltons anyway
15:35  Agbeladem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern I guess a lot of people considering the work done on that field
15:37  Agbeladem: okay thanks again people, have a nice day
15:37  KeiKurono: i do, i need singletons
15:38  mshaw: doubts
15:40 @cheeser: another day of singleton discussions coming up ?
15:40  mshaw: hope not
15:40 @cheeser: me, too.
15:41  mshaw: the summary is: singletons are often abused and rarely 'needed', if you use them, they shouldn't carry state and oh by the way, java doesn't support singletons
15:41  mshaw: should cover it
15:42 @cheeser: now when you say java doesn't support singletons...
15:42  retif: haha, sorry
15:44  retif: defensive copy means cloning ArrayList before iterating it?
15:46  nmx: well, if static weren't so BROKEN, singletons would be just fine
15:46 @cheeser: before returning it from a method or exposing it outside the owning object
15:46 * nmx ducks
15:46 @jottinger: guys, http://www.enigmastation.com/?p=508 - please review. (It's an entry trying to explain classpath for moro^Widio^Wdumbas^@newbies.)
15:46 * cheeser kicks nmx in the ball.
15:46 @jottinger: nmx: hahahaha
15:46  nmx: ow
15:47 @cheeser: jottinger: tl:dr
15:47 @cheeser: 8^)=
15:47 @cheeser: or tl;dr for you windows users
15:47  Agbeladem: mapreduce: I'm having a problem with that solution ; I'm trying to create a new file, using the / notation for the root of the classpath uuuh, and of course I have a FileNotFoundException
15:48  Agbeladem: that's the whole point of creating one : it's not there !
15:49  nmx: jottinger: seems pretty clear but your last paragraph is a good point - i would start showing it to people who are confused about the classpath and see if it works :P
15:50 @jottinger: nmx: the idea is to create a workable addition to the classpath factoid in javabot
15:50  nmx: yeah, seems reasonable
15:52  srounet: Hi
15:52  Agbeladem: Anybody ?
15:53  srounet: I have a BufferedImage and i want to send-it ( POST Method ) to an URL. Is there an easy-way to do that ?
15:54  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Yeah, you don't create or modify resources at runtime.  You want files instead.
15:54  amitz: hmm why do people ask question about classpath in the first case? *brainstorming*
15:54  mapreduce: FileOutputStream and friends.
15:55  Agbeladem: mapreduce: okay then
15:55  Agbeladem: so I use relative path, right ?
15:55  Agbeladem: I'm confused
15:55  mapreduce: Imagine your program gets installed to C:\Program Files\Mierda 1.0
15:56  Agbeladem: lol
15:56 @jottinger: amitz: because they're morons
15:56  mapreduce: If you write this file to C:\Program Files\Mierda 1.0\config.ini then your program won't work in Windows Vista or 7.
15:56  Agbeladem: mapreduce: so how do I access the working directory, I mean the root of the classpath from my jar
15:56  Agbeladem: to create files
15:56  mapreduce: You're still thinking classpath and file are somehow related.
15:57  Agbeladem: well
15:57  Agbeladem: I'm learning, right ? :p
15:57  mapreduce: Agbeladem: If it's installed to /usr/local/caca and your user has read-only access to that, trying to write to /usr/local/caca/foo.ini will fail.
15:57  amitz: jottinger: no seriously, perhaps it's an important key to make a simpler explanation?
15:57  Agbeladem: Sure
15:57  Agbeladem: I sure hope so :p poor user
15:57  mapreduce: Agbeladem: So to avoid this pretty silly form of failure, it should be pretty obvious that you don't want to write to your installation directory.
15:58  Agbeladem: well, the resources will be there obviously
15:58  mshaw: my inner child is amused by the scatalogy
15:58  mshaw: fyi
15:58  Agbeladem: and I want data in these resources
15:58  mapreduce: Other than on Windows, System.getProperty("user.home") + File.separator + ".shit" will be a reasonable place to write files.
15:58  Agbeladem: yes
15:58  Agbeladem: but I'm in need of a cross platform solution
15:59  mapreduce: Windows prefers you to use System.getenv("appdata") + Fle.separator + "Poop"
15:59  mapreduce: Did you see "Other than" in my previous sentence?
15:59  Agbeladem: so System.getenv("appdata") is the good solution for that ?
15:59  mapreduce: On Windows, yes.
15:59 * mshaw throws a merde out there
16:00 @jottinger: amitz: How do I make what i said simpler?
16:00  Agbeladem: mshaw:  I'm basically French
16:00 @jottinger: Agbeladem: I think we guessed.
16:00  Agbeladem: you guys rock lol
16:00  Agbeladem: mapreduce: but you didn't put any "Other than" so what, I have a different version for each OS ?
16:01  amitz: jottinger: All resources/classes are located relative to a "root", always. "Classpath" basically tells java where the root is. So a class located in package foo.bar, will be located in "classpath"+foo/bar in file system?
16:01  mshaw: but there can be many roots
16:01  mapreduce: Agbeladem: I'm sorry, I have explained it as much as I'm going to now.  Perhaps someone else will take over if you are still struggling.
16:01  nmx: isn't there some fancy Preferences API in java 6 for dealing with that stuff?
16:01  javaPythonSnake: Iol class path..
16:01  retif: is this code thread safe? http://pastebin.com/4WaEmxHj
16:02  amitz: mshaw: hmm good point.
16:02  Agbeladem: mapreduce: what you say is I'll use getenv("appdata") on windows and getProperty("user.home") elsewhere?
16:02  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Yes.
16:02  Agbeladem: so I do need different versions for each OS right ?
16:02  mapreduce: You don't need to distribute different binaries for each OS, if that's your question.
16:03  mshaw: or an if statement
16:03  mapreduce: An if statement will do.
16:03  Agbeladem: oh
16:03  Agbeladem: is that a System method too ?
16:03  mapreduce: Yes.  System.if(youBelieveThis, turnOff(theComputer));
16:05 * nmx blinks
16:06  Agbeladem: can I have a non-sarcastic answer please ? :p
16:06  nmx: Agbeladem: if you don't know what an if statement is, you need to go back to a basic java tutorial.
16:06  Agbeladem: lol
16:06  nmx: Agbeladem: i am not trying to be insulting, but that is a fact
16:07  Agbeladem: I know what an if statement is, that doesn't mean I know how to ask the system what OS it is based on
16:07  mshaw: it's a System property
16:07  mshaw: os.name i think
16:07  mapreduce: Agbeladem: You could do getenv and if it comes back with nothing, use System.getProperty("user.home").
16:08  retif: mapreduce: can you please take a look http://pastebin.com/GTW2pTVs is this code thread safe?
16:08  Agbeladem: okay
16:09  mapreduce: There's no threading involved, so yes.
16:12  retif: mapreduce: :), threading involved outside this object, i have a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException while calling isIpAllowed method
16:13  hmmmm: hi guys, i am trying to call a method that takes (E, java.lang.Object) and I am passing to it (java.lang.Object, nulltype)
16:13  hmmmm: how would i convert the java.lang.Object to an E?
16:13  mapreduce: retif: I don't know how to tell whether mutable data is threadsafe without being able to analyse its use.
16:13  mapreduce: Immutable data is easy.
16:14  hmmmm: anybody?
16:14  mapreduce: For example, a CopyOnWriteArrayList is not threadsafe if your threads assume it stays the same size.
16:14  soa2ii: Can someone with java + mysql experience please have a look at this code? http://pastebin.com/DKGS0VSX just 100 lines but it's damn slow and I'm not sure if I have to tune my code, mysql or both.
16:14  mapreduce: if (!list.isEmpty()) stuffThatCrashesOnEmptyLists(list)
16:15  javaPythonSnake: do you know how to use && ?
16:15  mshaw: soa2ii: pls2b not making more sql injection prone code
16:15  amitz: soa2ii: no way to magically know, you need profiler.
16:16  mshaw: i'm guessing the 4 nested loops might have something to do with it being slow
16:16  javaPythonSnake: my hint at &&
16:16  javaPythonSnake: short circuit.
16:16  soa2ii: mshaw: Well it's basically just 4 lists needed to go through. but they're in ram and don't do much stuff ...
16:17  Agbeladem: mapreduce: if I want to reuse this data later as a resource, I will put the appdata folder in the classpath, right ?
16:17  mshaw: soa2ii: 4 lists of what size?
16:17  soa2ii: mshaw: what do you mean with sql injection prone code?
16:17  soa2ii: mshaw: depends on the parsed xml file. But not that huge.
16:18  mshaw: i mean stop interpolating string values into sql strings
16:18  soa2ii: the xml parsing and so on is done very quick ... the mysql stuff is the slow part
16:18  mshaw: use placeholders
16:18  retif: mapreduce: they are not assume that, theads just iterate and call a method on every item from the list
16:18  soa2ii: mshaw: You mean precompiled statesments?
16:18  mshaw: yes
16:19  mshaw: jesus murders a child whenever someone writes code that doesn't use parameterized queries
16:19  soa2ii: :P
16:19  mshaw: with a rusty straight razor
16:19  KeiKurono: that jesus..
16:19  javaPythonSnake: prepared?
16:19  soa2ii: mshaw: So I would have to do how many statemsnt?
16:19  soa2ii: I'm not used to them
16:20  mshaw: soa2ii: exactly the same as you do now
16:20  soa2ii: Hm, okej.
16:20  hmmmm: can anybody help me?
16:20  hmmmm: i'm sure this is an obvious question
16:20  Agbeladem: hmmmm: don't ask to ask
16:20  hmmmm: i asked...
16:20  Agbeladem: just go on with ti
16:20  Agbeladem: it*
16:20  hmmmm: <hmmmm> hi guys, i am trying to call a method that takes (E, java.lang.Object) and I am passing to it (java.lang.Object, nulltype)
16:20  hmmmm: <hmmmm> how would i convert the java.lang.Object to an E?
16:21  mshaw: ~Agbeladem++
16:21  javabot: agbeladem has a karma level of 0, mshaw
16:21  hmmmm: <hmmmm> anybody?
16:21  Agbeladem: there isn't a conversion
16:21  Agbeladem: but you can sure cast
16:21  hmmmm: how would i cast
16:21  Agbeladem: (E)object
16:21  hmmmm: (<E>typehere)?
16:21  hmmmm: (E)
16:21  soa2ii: mshaw: Well, fine. I think the problem might be the MySQL DB then or do you see problems in my code? The huge list is just the last loop (maybe around 1000 entries) the others are just around 5 i think
16:21  hmmmm: what's the difference between <E> and (E)
16:21 @jottinger: amitz: the thing about your statement is that the "root" is actually a list of roots
16:21  Agbeladem: <> refer to genericity
16:22  Agbeladem: I'm sorry, &lt and &gt aren't working by me xD
16:22  Agbeladem: (E) is casting
16:22  javaPythonSnake: generic
16:22  Agbeladem: the other thing you wrote is generic
16:22  Agbeladem: if you don't know what genericity is, then you probably shouldn't use them
16:23  hmmmm: yea
16:23  hmmmm: so I'd have to know the underlying type in order to do it 'safely'
16:23  hmmmm: the problem is I don't
16:23  Agbeladem: how come you don't ?
16:23  mapreduce: Agbeladem: No, you'll read it as a file.
16:23  hmmmm: I am using a class from a precompiled .jar
16:23  hmmmm: no documentation
16:24  Agbeladem: mapreduce: I guess that's okay
16:24  Agbeladem: hmmmm: use reflexivity
16:24  amitz: jottinger: yeah, someone pointed that out -_-
16:24  hmmmm: dunno what that is
16:24  javaPythonSnake: Why can't you use generics, if you're not an expert at them?
16:24 @jottinger: javaPythonSnake: because you'll do it wrong, you moron.
16:25  javaPythonSnake: so I should learn how to be perfect prior to ever using them?
16:25  Agbeladem: hmmmm: java.reflect.*
16:25  javaPythonSnake: you're an idiot
16:25 @jottinger: no.
16:25  hmmmm: okay, thanks
16:25  mshaw: soa2ii: the inner loop executes at least 125000 times according to you. which means it makes 500000 queries against the database and 1250000 inserts.
16:25  mshaw: 125000 rather
16:25  whaley: web scale.
16:25 @jottinger: Sure, I'm an idiot. And I don't think I know generics perfectly. But if you're clueless, they're nothing more than a rope you use to hang yourself. And when you do, you'll whine to us.
16:25  Agbeladem: mapreduce: one last question though, if I want to make an installer, if has to create all my data either in ~/.program/ or in getenv("appdata")/, right ?
16:25  mshaw: soa2ii: so you're wondering why it's... slow?
16:26 @jottinger: and I don't want to be whined to.
16:26  soa2ii: mshaw: Yeah, but my server just has a query per second rate from around 100
16:26 @jottinger: heh
16:26  Agbeladem: hmmmm: there's also that "instanceof" command, but it REALLY is bad, man
16:26  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Generally, installers get given privileges.
16:26 @joed: Why is that really bad?
16:26  Agbeladem: instanceof ? Because it breaks polymorphism
16:26  amitz: soa2ii: for what it worth, prepared statement can "save" query on the database, it may surprisingly increase your speed
16:26  mshaw: soa2ii: maybe you should reconsider your design
16:27  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Do catch blocks break polymorphism?
16:27 @jottinger: instanceof is a statement, not a command.
16:27  amitz: soa2ii: or save something.
16:27  Agbeladem: =)
16:27  Agbeladem: true, it's an operator
16:27  mapreduce: I try not to make my installers require privileges, so that non-admin users can shove stuff in their home directories.
16:27  mshaw: probably all of that querying can be combined into one
16:27  mapreduce: Agbeladem: izpack is good if you are creating an installer.
16:27  Agbeladem: yes I heard that
16:27  mapreduce: launch4j in combination with it is nice too.
16:27  javaPythonSnake: us?
16:27  Agbeladem: mapreduce: so will izpack ask me where to create the application data folder ?
16:27  Agbeladem: when I create the installer I mean
16:28 @jottinger: javaPythonSnake: "the channel." i.e., the people you annoy when you whine about how you screwed up and it's clearly java's fault.
16:28  whaley: everyone, please ignore jottinger if he seems cranky this morning.  he is probably upset that christain ponder used lube on his hands last night
16:28  amitz: soa2ii: and some databases have the concept of bulk insert. It's way faster.
16:28  javaPythonSnake: heh
16:28 @jottinger: whaley: bwaha! I didn't even know FSU PLAYED until this morning
16:28  whaley: jottinger: :(
16:28  mapreduce: Agbeladem: No, as it's generally the running app that creates data files.
16:28  soa2ii: I'll switch to prepared statement first ... then I'll reconsider my design
16:28  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Also consider that at install time not all the users may exist.
16:28  Agbeladem: aarg this is killing me xD
16:29  whaley: jottinger: the silver lining for me is that now maybe florida fans will shutup about Ponder like they should have shutup about Tebow in regards to getting picked by FL NFL teams </offtopic>
16:29  Agbeladem: So I basically put all the data in the jar
16:29  Agbeladem: and extract them at the first runtime ?
16:29 @jottinger: FSU fans haven't been oozing over ponder THAT much - esp after OU
16:29  amitz: soa2ii: the design change will be the most significant improvement from all. You should select ALL, then find the relevant objects locally from your dataset. And that bulk insert.
16:29 @jottinger: one of the things about being the football messiah is that you have to, like, save people from stuff, not get plastered when you face yoru first good defense of the year
16:30  soa2ii: amitz: I thought so. I'm just fixing old code here ... let's reconsider design then.
16:30  amitz: s/objects/rows/
16:31 @jottinger: whaley: Ponder's heisman candidacy: "Wow, 47-10 or so! In a game against OU! WOW! Oh, wait, FSU had the 10?"
16:33  Agbeladem: mapreduce: So I basically put all the default data in the jar and extract them at the first runtime ?
16:34  amitz: soa2ii: umm.. I may be too nosy here but in older java version (not sure now), ResultSet was linked to PreparedStatement. So if you destroy the PS, the RS will be gone. It's a somewhat unexpected behavior, cost my company many mandays -_-
16:35  soa2ii: amitz: Well where would this affect my code?
16:36  amitz: soa2ii: If you use ResultSet class, in case you plan to go ahead refactor your code.
16:36  mapreduce: Agbeladem: Sounds reasonable to me.
16:36  soa2ii: amitz: I'm using ResultSet right now
16:37  javaPythonSnake: I love searching for things using chromes URL box, it makes me feel like I'm totally out of control.

20:03  term_: What data type is a filehandle? If I want to pass a filehandle to a method what data type do I declare?
20:03  sbalmos: term_: A filehandle is an OS-level detail, and generally doesn't have anything to do with Java.
20:03 @jottinger: how are you getting filehandles in the first place?
20:04  sbalmos: jottinger: A book!
20:04  term_: Sorry I should have said scanner object
20:04 * jottinger snickers
20:04  sbalmos: o_o
20:04  sbalmos: File handle... Scanner... yeah, they're similar!
20:04 @jottinger: sorry, I'm laughing at myself, you just caught me badly offguard
20:04 @jottinger: "I have this car... no, I meant to say this hammer."
20:04 --- Channel ##java was synced in 139 seconds
20:05 @jottinger: well, if it's a Scanner, perhaps you should pass it around as a Scanner.
20:05 @jottinger: Just a thought.
20:05  karega: how can I create a java.util.Set using JSTL?
20:05  term_: Scanner inFile = new Scanner(new FileReader(filename));
20:05  term_: lol
20:05  term_: yeah
20:06 @jottinger: karega: you really shouldn't
20:06  term_: I'm very new to java (obviously) and I guess I'm just used to parameters always being primitive data types
20:06  term_: so thank you obviously it's of type Scanner
20:07 @jottinger: It wasn't obvious you were new to java, we have people who claim to be experts but don't understand very basic things
20:07  term_: glad I made you all laugh ;p
20:07  nmx: term_: what language have you used that only allows primitive types to be passed as parameters?
20:07 @jottinger: nmx: C!
20:07  nmx: uhm
20:07  karega: jottinger, I know but there is no way to do it?  or even just create an array?
20:08 @jottinger: karega: I dunno, as soon as you ask the question you should be saying "Oh, I know, this isn't what JSTL is for, this idea is loaded with fail"
20:08  karega: yeah
20:08 @jottinger: ... followed by pursuit of an idea that is NOT loaded with fail
20:09  term_: nmx: You can read "I'm just used to.." as "In my early CS1 learning material"
20:10  karega: jottinger, you have any ideas?
20:10  nmx: term_: ah.
20:10  karega: I am using a JSON TLD and I can't use any scriptlet code inside of the tags
20:10  karega: breaks the schema I guess
20:18  untwisted: I have an array of type Method[] and would like to essentially serialize the list, send it over a network, and then call the methods on the other end. I can do the serializiation, but how would I go about calling the methods on the other end (I'm new to java reflection)
20:18 @jottinger: untwisted: ... oh lord
20:18 @jottinger: untwisted: how are you going to call the methods without an instance to call them WITH?
20:19  svm_invictvs: Given this. http://mysticpaste.com/view/3372 What's the easiset way to write a unit test to show there's a race condition?
20:19  untwisted: jottinger: I instantiate a new object on the other end first
20:19 @jottinger: right, right. And what kind of object is it?
20:19  sbalmos: jottinger: Screw CORBA, to hell with RMI, and damn SOAP to hell!
20:19  marens: hehe
20:19  svm_invictvs: Have a few threads hit that function and then have each one validate that subsequent calls return the same object, right?
20:20  untwisted: jottinger: its a configuration object, it just stores some configuration options.  Unfortunately its not serializable or I'd just send that over the network
20:20  untwisted: jottinger: so to get around it I built a wrapper class that takes the method names and parameters as a key / value pair, sends em across the network, and now I want to instantiate the object and call the methods on it
20:21 @jottinger: untwisted: this sounds like a very very strange design
20:21  sbalmos: jottinger: Kinda sounds like XML-RPC. ;)
20:22  untwisted: jottinger: Yaaaah, its not my optimal solution, but I can't modify the other code, I have to build on top of it :|
20:22  multi_io: well, it's not *remote* procedure calls
20:22 @tjsnell: RESTeasy
20:23 * svm_invictvs headdesk
20:23  svm_invictvs: I hate how when I point out a glaring race condition, I get, "Well, it doesnt' braek in the unit tests."
20:23  untwisted: svm_invictvs: :-/
20:24  untwisted: So is there any way to make my method calls on the other end, or do I need to try a new design? :P
20:24  sbalmos: svm_invictvs: That's like my production defect report I got a day after I put something in production, because the data I send to some other system is incomplete for the downstream system that gets fed by that other system... and no one thinks of doing a full end-to-end test
