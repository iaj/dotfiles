21:34  ambro718: Hi. When I try to commit, I get "svn: resource out of date; try updating" because some file was changed on the server. How do I commit my local version?
21:35  ambro718: I want to "run over" the conflicting change with the file as I have it.
21:38  IcePic: when running "svn up" to update, you could try   --accept ARG             : specify automatic conflict resolution action
21:39  IcePic:                             ('postpone', 'base', 'mine-conflict',
21:39  IcePic:                              'theirs-conflict', 'mine-full', 'theirs-full',
21:39  IcePic: and set "mine-full"
21:39  IcePic:                              'edit', 'launch')
21:39  IcePic: (text from 'svn help update')
21:43  sacho: ambro718: you have to update first. it's a safeguard on svn commit.
21:44  ambro718: yes but I don't want update to mess up my files. So I solved by exporing everything, updating, and copyng the export over it

23:08  madsj: hi; I get this error message:
23:08  madsj: svn: Aborting commit: '/xbar/nas2/home4/s06/s062126/kurser/02249/project/src/02249/src/tsp' remains in conflict
23:09 --- fpk^off is now known as fpk
23:09  madsj: the directory tsp does not exist, so how do I get rid of the error message?
23:12  madsj: http://pastebin.com/3M1VsFp9
23:19  Aardwolf: Hi, I'm trying to use rapidsvn on Linux, but I see nothing. Everything is just empty. I start the program from within a svn directory though. How can I see the actual files and see a visual diff between the current files and the base?

23:31  tokam: Is it usual that you do not commit the project directly to svn?
23:31  tokam: that it is stored in a subfolder at the server?
23:31  tokam: like trunk e.g.
23:39  imMute: tokam1: uh, what?
23:41  tokam1: my subversion plugin commited my projekt to https://myserver.net/projektname/
23:42  imMute: tokam1: okay?
23:42  tokam1: is this the way to do it? or is https://myserver.net/ more likely
23:42  imMute: tokam1: depends on how your server is setup

23:44  imMute: tokam1: if it worked, it worked.  if it didn't, what error message did you get?
23:44  tokam1: it works, but I write a bash script to do sth with svn servers.
23:45  tokam1: But I think anyway I can not expect from a client to submit to the default dir.
23:49  imMute: tokam1: you're not making much sense.
23:49  tokam1: :D I do =)
23:50  tokam1: just asked myself if it is normal to commit a project in it's own subfolder (if you share it the 1st time) is not it called commit?
23:51  imMute: babelfish really sucks sometimes.
