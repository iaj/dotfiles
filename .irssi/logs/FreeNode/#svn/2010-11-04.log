09:27  l_r: what is the best client with guy working on win and unix and able to handle many repositories at the same time, and STABLE?
09:27  l_r: *GUI
09:27  IcePic: "handle" ?
09:27  l_r: use as client
09:28  IcePic: remember their names?
09:28  l_r: what names
09:28  IcePic: "many repositories"
09:29  IcePic: I dont get what "handle many repos" means. To me it sounds like "how do I make a user handle lots of directories on the USB stick"
09:29  l_r: IcePic, more like browsing, and allowing to use svn add,del,diff,status,log etc..
09:29  l_r: on a single window maybe
09:29  l_r: maybe also admin stuff like copying repos, etc..
09:30  IcePic: copying repos is serverside operations so it would not be something a client gui normally would focus on
09:30  l_r: ok, what about the rest
09:30  IcePic: for win, using tortoisesvn makes it simple and pretty.
09:31  l_r: does it work on unix?
09:32  l_r: IcePic, another question i have not been answered yesterday
09:32  IcePic: l_r: no, but there are lots of ways to work with svn on unices which more depend on how you work (cmd line for cmd line fans, built-in in eclipse for those developing in that IDE and so on)
09:32  IcePic: wayita: clients?
09:32  wayita: IcePic: windows: tortoisesvn, ankhsvn (visual studio .net) | cross platform: workbench, svn-up, subclipse (eclipse), supervision, subcommander, rapidsvn, jsvn, psvn.el, esvn, qsvn, eric3, kdesvn | OSX: scplugin, SvnX | *nix: KDevelop | If you're learning svn, it's easier for us to help you if you _don't_ use a GUI.
09:32  l_r: basically the book gives the example: svnadmin --create REPOSITORY. this will create a new directory with all the default stuff inside. But what should I do if i want to create a new repository starting from pre-defined layout of directories (without importing the from the svn client command)?
09:33  IcePic: you can still create it (empty), make a checkout (of the empty repo) in your existing structure, add the lot and then commit it
09:33  IcePic: but using svn import would do most of that work for you
09:33  IcePic: the end result will not differ
09:34  l_r: IcePic, that is ok, from the client. but isnt there a way from the admin tool?
09:34  l_r: on the server side basically
09:34  IcePic: for most serious setups, the server and the (many) clients arent the same, so getting to know how to work svn with 1+ meter between the two isnt wasted knowledge
09:35  l_r: of course..
09:35  IcePic: and if doing "svnadmin create REPO ; svn import <dir> <repo>" is too much work, then make a script
09:36  l_r: another question: is webdav stable for production use?
09:36  IcePic: You seem very focused to take a whole day asking how to save 12 seconds you do once in a repo lifetime.
09:36  IcePic: l_r: yes, serving svn over http has been done for many years.
11:13  l_r: is there a demo of webdav somewhere?
11:13  l_r: wayita, what's the best tool you have mentioned
12:17  IcePic: l_r: wayita is a bot that hands out FAQs
12:17  IcePic: l_r: and there is no single "best" for all values of good.
12:19  IcePic: if you run the GNOME environment, "best" will not necessarily be an app made to integrate with KDE. Speed, cost, number-of-features, simplicity, documentation and userbase also weigh in on what is considered "best" at any given situation
12:20  l_r: i think i ll go with the http interface from svn itself, although i would have also liked a standalone version for production use. but external opensource clients do not convince me enough
12:22  IcePic: I dont get what you refer to as "a standalone version", but svn can serve data in 5-6 different ways, whereas only http/https needs apache, in the normal setup most people use.
12:23  l_r: standalone as in not requiring a web server
12:24  l_r: accesing the repository via file:///
12:24  l_r: (or even svn daemon)
12:27  IcePic: I though "not needing apache" fell into the "the http interface from svn itself" category, which made it hard for me to understand what the difference between "from svn itself" and "a standalone version"
12:27  IcePic: ..was
12:29  Dr4g: I'm trying "svnadmin load repo < repo.dump"
12:29  Dr4g: i get this message
12:29  Dr4g: svnadmin: File already exists: filesystem '/my/repo/web_course_builder/db', transaction '9-1', path '.htaccess'
12:30  Dr4g: nevermind
12:30  Dr4g: made a $var typo
12:31  l_r: IcePic, webdav is the module providing the http user interface to daemon/repository/backend right? it requires a midd-end like apache. I would have liked a "standalone" client with GUI accessing the repository via FSFS, thus not requiring apache in the middle
12:34  l_r: but those kind of  clients external to the svn project do not convince me for production use from mostly dumb people
12:36  l_r: so i think we'll be compelled to use the http interface which is maintained in svn to have some level of stability
12:38  l_r: anyway that "tortoisvn" which integrates svn in the explorer seems interesting from a  functionality point of view
12:38  l_r: is it stable?
12:43  Dr4g: I just created a blank repo, i just tried a checkout of it and i get "Repository removed permanently: "repo url"; please relocate
12:43  Dr4g: I can browse to the repo in my browser just fine.
12:48  IcePic: l_r: I think the serf library that comes with svn can be a webdav server also.
13:04  l_r: really?
13:05  l_r: interesting
13:21  IcePic: seems like it was "only" a client side webdav library to replace the neon lib used normally by svn
13:21  IcePic: 8-/
14:34  dsdeiz: hm, how would i resolve a "local missing, incoming edit upon merge" message?
14:46  dsdeiz: doing just svn resolve --accept working didn't seem to go well :(

16:15  Ben5: hello svn
16:16  Ben5: what's good way to restart svn without restarting a system
16:16  lov: Hi, I've got a question. The directory setup on my repo was done strangely (and imo incorrectly), and I'd like to rectify it. The layout is /, /Project1, /Project2, /branch, /tags. I'd like to move Project1 and Project2 under a new directory, called trunk. It looks like I want to use svn move, but will this end up destroying my ability to look through changes made previous to this point?
16:18  IcePic: lov: no it will not
16:18  IcePic: if you use svn rename/mv it will most definately retain history for you
16:20  infid: why do i have a file named svn-commit.tmp showing up in my working copy?
16:20  lov: IcePic: excellent
16:27 @jeremyw: infid: Probably left over from a commit you canceled or that was rejected.
16:27 @jeremyw: It holds your commit message in it so you don't have to retype.
16:29  Altreus: What's the svn command to clean out all files not in RC?
16:30 @jeremyw: RC?
16:30  Altreus: revision control ...
16:30  Altreus: There's a perl script here to do it but I work at a stupid company so that won't work
16:31  Altreus: hm it might just ...
16:31  lov: svn find, grep the unversioned files...
16:31  larrys: the corect term is working copy.
16:31  lov: s/find/status/
16:31  Altreus: lov: I'm using TortoiseSVN due to aforementioned idiocy
16:31  lov: check for modifications, sort by modification type.
16:31  lov: select everything in the "unversioned" category :)
16:31  Altreus: -_- ok
16:31  lov: *del*
16:31  Altreus: gotcha
16:32  lov: of course, that's PROBABLY asking for trouble, when you delete a file that it turns out you needed, but that's on you :>
16:34  Altreus: The directory is defined as the place where if you put something you needed you're an idiot
16:35 @jeremyw: svn st | grep "\\?" | xargs -0 rm -fR
16:36 @jeremyw: But, you probably want to do this more smart than that.
16:36  Altreus: probably not
16:36  Altreus: :)
16:37  Altreus: It's definitely a do-not-VC directory
16:37 @jeremyw: What's the point of this again?  I mean, I understand your question but why?
16:37  larrys: and sounds like you have some canidites for svn:ignore if you delete this often.
16:37 @jeremyw: Yup.
16:37  Altreus: I am doing
16:37  Altreus: But, they're still on the disk
16:37  Altreus: I'm cleaning up the data generated by test runs and things
16:38  Altreus: specifically, images that were uploaded by buggy scripts
16:38  larrys: sounds like it should be part of your build process, like for maven, mvn clean.
16:38  larrys: or make distclean
16:38  Altreus: haha as if we have a build process
16:39 @jeremyw: Altreus: That definitely sounds like it's a good svn:ignore candidate, although your script should also clean up after itself.
16:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#svn +o DannyB]
16:39  larrys: and instead of deleting unversioned files, you can delete all svn:ignored patterns in your working copy.
16:40  Altreus: larrys: oh, with an svn command
16:40  Altreus: ?
16:41  larrys: No
16:41  larrys: Something you script up.
16:41  Altreus: ok
16:41  Altreus: I painstakingly added ignore to all the stupid subdirectories that should have been done properly in the first place so I can do that in future :)
16:42  Altreus: ta for the pointers
16:49 @peterS: jeremyw: so with your svn status | grep | xargs thing, first off, xargs -0 won't work very well in a pipeline with grep (:  second, you'll want svn status --no-ignore
17:21 @jeremyw: peterS: It was untested, although I thought that since svn:ignore wasn't involved, --no-ignore wasn't necessary then but I think it's a good pattern.  ;)
17:23 @jeremyw: Yeah...the -0 doesn't work.
17:23 @jeremyw: Good catch.
17:41 --- kthomas_vh is now known as kthomas
17:50 @peterS: jeremyw: well, the best solution is still svn-clean from contrib/client-side.  I use svn-clean at least 5 times a day, at work
17:50 @peterS: (it is almost a substitute for a working 'make clean' target!)
