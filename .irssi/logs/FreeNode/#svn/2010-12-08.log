23:46  iaj: lo there :)  what would be the way to bring a whole folder that's on a svn repo to its latest online status - dropping all modifications I made?
23:54  Drakfyre: Hello everyone
23:56  Drakfyre: I have an SVN server and a Web server set up on a machine that has a dynamic IP address.  I currently have a VERY simple homebrew dynamic dns system that uses PHP to update my ip address to a server I have on Bluehostand and redirect a web browser to my home machine on the dynamic ip address.
23:57  Drakfyre: Is there any way to set up a redirect like this that will work on an SVN client?  Setting it up to redirect in the same way gives me some error about an OPTIONS request failing, likely due to SVN being a different protocol than HTTP
