09:00  madsj: hi; how do I fix this conflict:
09:00  madsj: svn: Aborting commit: '/xbar/nas2/home4/s06/s062126/kurser/02249/project/src/02249/src/tsp' remains in conflict
09:00  madsj: I wish to override the tsp-folder, and don't want to keep it
09:01  madsj: http://pastebin.com/3M1VsFp9 and I've read the svnbook (section where this particular conflict is described)
09:02  madsj: and as I read it, there would be a dialogue, but there isn't

12:34  nvictor: i have a question peepol
12:35  nvictor: i have been working in a folder that is not a working copy
12:35  nvictor: now i want to add all the files from that folder to a new folder i just created in my working repo
12:35  nvictor: i tried svn cp c:\lab\sb pdfe2 <--- sb is the folder
12:36  nvictor: now i get
12:36  nvictor: svn: 'c:\lab\sb' is not a working copy >:(
12:37  IcePic: svn cp will only work with versioned stuff, so you need to get the files inside a WC and svn add them there.
12:37  nvictor: i see
12:38  nvictor: a shell copy then
12:38  nvictor: thanks
12:39  IcePic: but it is right to use "svn cp" whenever possible, so dont kick that habit
12:44  nvictor: IcePic: duly noted.

14:59  Flawless: Hi folks. I have a development branch (/branches/devel) that was forked from /trunk a while ago. Now I would like /trunk to be a copy of /branches/devel, so I can continue development in that
15:00  Flawless: what's the best way to proceed? svn rm /trunk ; svn cp /branches/devel /trunk ?
15:00  Flawless: will that allow me to update a checkout that contains /trunk, or will it complain that the top-level dir is gone?
15:14  sbs: hi
15:14  sbs: is it possible to revert a single file at a given revision if several where committed at that revision?
15:15  sbs: is this possible from tortoise, does this require command line ?

18:39  Whiskey: yeh
18:39  Whiskey: but them inside the svn
18:39  Whiskey: not logical on my computer right
18:39  sacho: where do you think your working copy is, in space?
18:39  Whiskey: no
18:39  Whiskey: don´t make fun of me
18:40  Whiskey: i will have it saved as logical files when i updated it
18:40  sacho: look into svn export, hooks, maybe one of them would match what you're asking, because I can't really tell what it is
18:40  Whiskey: ffs
18:40  Whiskey: in svn
18:40  Whiskey: its in side the svn
18:40  Whiskey: the only way to open it are whit checkout
18:40  Whiskey: right
18:40  Whiskey: if you don´t have a working directory :)
18:40 --- Channel #svn was synced in 120 seconds
18:41  sacho: or svn export.
18:41  Whiskey: but
18:41  Whiskey: can svn export be used everytime you updated it automatic by a config
18:41  Whiskey: or whatever way to make that work
18:42  Whiskey: or does it need to be manualy everytime
18:43  sacho: Whiskey: there is a concept for svn repositories called "hooks", which are executed every time several specific operations are carried out on the repository
18:44  Whiskey: hate this
18:44  Whiskey: are so new into svn :/
18:46  ebresie: sacho: Can I rename a file to an already existing filename?  Does it keep the history?
18:47  Whiskey: dosen´t find mutch about it :/
18:47  ebresie: sacho: Actually based on svn-book page 106-107, it may not be real possible either.  Has svn changed with improvements here?
18:48  sacho: the svn book has an up-to-date version, so if you're reading that, I doubt
18:48  ebresie: I essentially have the "integer.c" to "whole.c" use case here.
18:49  Whiskey: are you sure we talk about same thing
18:49  Whiskey: when i do a commit i want it to be saved in svn and lets say C:/program/project/ccc.cpp
18:49  Whiskey: or updated
18:49  Whiskey: everytime i upated the files
18:59  Whiskey: sacho: you still there?
19:01  sacho: nope
19:01  Whiskey: hehe
19:01  Whiskey: svn export does what im was after
19:01  Whiskey: know im just after to run it after every commit and i fixed what i asked for if that possible

19:33  Renter: ebresie: yes, if you rename the history for the file will be kept
19:35  Whiskey: no one around
19:35  Whiskey: i don´t get post-commit to work
19:41  Renter: ?
19:41  Renter: I'm around
19:42  Renter: what's the problem?
19:57  Whiskey: i can´t do svn export
19:57  Whiskey: in the post-commit.bat file
19:57  Whiskey: its says something like culdent open the archive
19:59  Whiskey: try to do
19:59  Whiskey: http://pastebin.com/9XhepvDP
20:00  Whiskey: http://pastebin.com/yE9BBPgS
20:00  Whiskey: any help wuld be nice :)
20:01  ebresie: Renter:What if you rename (1B) to a name that already exists (1A)?  Will it "overwrite" the file (new 1A)and retain history for both files (1A and 1B history kept with 1A)?
20:03  Renter: unknown paste id?
20:03  Renter: yyyeah, you don't want to do that
20:04  Renter: look into svnmirror for mirroring
20:05  Renter: you can overwrite files, yes
20:06  Renter: after that the new file's history will be from the copied file
20:06  Renter: you can track with --stop-on-copy
20:07  Renter: the old file's history will be available with -r <revision_where_file_existed>
