13:03  l_r: does a svn dump also dump hooks?
13:04  sacho: probably not
13:08  l_r: can i dump from windows and load the dumped repository in unix?

21:41  SeanInSeattle: Hey all.  What are the rules about naming files for post or pre commit hooks?  Is there a comprehensive svn hook tutorial that someone can point me to?
21:44  SeanInSeattle: Hey all.  Can someone point me to a good tutorial on writing subversion hooks?
21:55  larrys: SeanInSeattle: I used the svnbook to help me... and google...
21:55  SeanInSeattle: larrys:   I searched before, but didn't find much.  And now i"m looking at little closer at the svn book hosted online at red bean something-or-other... and that's giving me some more details.  Thanks.
22:02  SeanInSeattle: Should I implement a start-commit or pre-commit hook?  Which event is better for running unit tests and failing checkin if they fail the test suite?
22:06  larrys: You realize that will cause commits to take a while and potentiolly cause other problems (of course, that depends on how long the compile/tests take to run), etc...
22:06  larrys: and start-commit happens before stuff is sent to the server.
22:06 @peterS: anyway, start-commit does not have access to the commit data, so, yeah, not a lot of testing gonna happen there
22:07  larrys: I use something like Hudson to run builds, sure it does not reject the commit, but it is a bit more sane... and you could put in logic in Hudson or some other CI tool to revert the commit.
22:35  larrys: SeanInSeattle: In case you missed it: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn?date=2010-11-05#l361
22:36  SeanInSeattle: larrys:  Yeah, thanks for that.  I got dropped, and was having connectivity issues.

23:32  tuga3d: say i have a branch(not local) i've already made some commits, but the changes i made in my local copy are from trunk. What is the best way to copy the trunk to my branch?
23:40 @peterS: tuga3d: your wording is a bit unclear.  what do you mean "the changes i made in my local copy are from trunk"?
23:41 @peterS: tuga3d: the local working copy, is it for trunk or for the branch?  ('svn info' will tell)
23:42  tuga3d: peterS: is for branch, but i want to copy the trunk to the branch, bacause i want to delete my older modifications
23:42 @peterS: tuga3d: oh - so - you want to delete the branch and re-branch?  without any of the changes that are in the branch now?
23:42  tuga3d: peterS: yep :)
23:43  tuga3d: what is the best way to do that?
23:44 @peterS: tuga3d: well.  you can go one of two ways.  one is to delete and recreate the branch.  this means if you have any working copies of the branch, you'll need to 'svn switch ^/branches/branchname' to get them to "hop over" the delete + recreate, after you've done it
23:44 @peterS: tuga3d: second way is to just make the branch identical to current trunk
23:45  tuga3d: peterS: thnks! how do i do the second one?
23:46  ronny: hi
23:46 @peterS: one moment (on the phone)
23:46  tuga3d: peterS: ok
23:49  ronny: is there any way to get log in ascending order fast?
23:49  ronny: if i start one svn just completely hangs
23:51 @peterS: ronny: you mean like: svn log -r0:HEAD
23:51  ronny: yes
23:51 @peterS: tuga3d: the second way is a 2-URL merge, basically.  you want to merge the "difference between branchname and trunk" into branchname.  this effectively makes branchname equivalent to trunk, without a delete / recopy
23:51  ronny: i intend to use it from the api, but the ordering hangup makes it rather problematid, would like to avoid repeated calls to chunks of the history
23:52 @peterS: tuga3d: so, in a branch working copy:  'svn merge ^/branches/branchname ^/trunk .'
23:53  tuga3d: peterS: thnks so much, i'll try that
23:53 @peterS: tuga3d: the order seems a bit strange but if you think about it it makes sense.  (start with B, add diff-between-B-and-A, you basically get A)
23:53  tuga3d: yep, that makes sense
23:54 @peterS: ronny: I don't know what you mean 'completely hangs', I do 'svn log -r1:HEAD' often enough and it seems to perform about as fast as any other 'svn log'
23:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#svn +o DannyB]
23:55  ronny: peterS: i run it on a local 70k rev repo and it hangs for seconds before giving output, while imeadely giving output when running it in descending order
23:56  ronny: not creating any cpu load tho, but the disk gets awfully busy
23:56 @peterS: ronny: ah, presumably because it has to trace the current directory back to see where it came from and which revisions affected it.  it can't trace the _other_ direction (the direction you actually want) because of how it follows history that moves around with 'svn cp' and 'svn mv'
23:57  ronny: ouch
23:57 @peterS: in other words if you're in branches/foo, it doesn't have a terribly efficient way to find where-did-'branches/foo'-begin-and-what-was-it-called-at-the-time, it has to trace backward
23:58  ronny: i suppose there is no wayto cache it
23:58  ronny: or ignore it
23:58 @peterS: there is in fact a 'node origins' cache in some repository versions.  I'm trying to remember the details.
23:58  ronny: i really need the log of the history of a base dir
