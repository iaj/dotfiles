00:00  ronny: hmm, ok, its really fast on the repo root, and really slow in a subdir
00:00  ronny: i think for my purposes i can have some filtering
00:00 @peterS: *nod*.  at the root it doesn't have to find the origin or do any filtering
00:00 @peterS: it's possible that the root case has been optimized
00:00  ronny: no way yo turn off orgin finding?
00:01 @peterS: well, it has to find the origin of your current directory.  i.e., what revision it came from and what it was named
00:01 @peterS: no way to get around that other than to pretend the branch has always been there, with its current filename, and every revision affected it
00:02  ronny: i got a multi project repo and want the history of a single base for trunk/branches/...
00:04 @peterS: ronny: there is a svn-populate-node-origins-index tool distributed in the source tarball under tools/server-side/.  I am not too clear on exactly what it populates or where, but if you run that on your repository it ... might help
00:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#svn +o kfogel]
00:07  ronny: peterS: seems an order of magnitude faster now, still pretty slow compared to modern vcs's tho
00:07 @peterS: ronny: faster with a hot cache in general, or faster after you ran svn-node-origins-index on it?
00:08 @peterS: errr svn-populate-node-origins-index
00:08  ronny: faster after the svn-populate-node-origins-index
00:08 @peterS: *nod*.  good to know that actually helped.  it was sort of a guess on my part.
01:00  tuxx_: hey guys

01:00  tuxx_: doesnt work
01:06 --- fpk is now known as fpk^off
01:10  davetoo: is it possible to mirror only a subset of a repo?  A certain revision range and a subset of the namespace tree?
01:12  l_r: of course
01:15  davetoo: ok, part II: how? :)
01:16  davetoo: kewords, manual URL, etc
01:16  davetoo: i.e. just point me in the right direction and I'll go STFW some more
01:41  l_r: davetoo, see the manual, mirroring , and svnadmin dumpfilter
01:50  davetoo: dumpfilter, ok, thanks
