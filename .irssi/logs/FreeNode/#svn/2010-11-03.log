12:30  oelewapperke: I seem to have screwed up my repository
12:30  oelewapperke: there is no trunk/ folder
12:31  oelewapperke: and I can't seem to create branches
12:31  oelewapperke: (using eclipse)

12:52  IcePic: oelewapperke: that report seems a bit vague.
12:52  IcePic: oelewapperke: test with another client and "svn ls protocol://server/path/repo" and see if trunk is there or not. Or "svn log" the last days and see if anyone committed a delete of it recently.
12:53  IcePic: OR, eclipse might have lost its grip of reality and you just need to fix that.
12:53  IcePic: given "something doesnt seem to work", its impossible to tell
15:29  rdg: thanks sacho
15:48  mst: is it possible to stack LDAP and htaccess based mod_dav_svn auth?
15:48  mst: hmm ... AuthBasicProvider is apache, maybe this isn't svn-specific
16:09  infid: is it a bad idea to run 'svn update' if my working copy isn't clean (free off local modifications)?
16:14  larrys: infid: you will most likely have to run svn update before you commit anyway...
16:23  infid: so if i run svn up and get a conflict its only preventable either by me working on a branch or by having told the other person i'm already working on that file?
16:23  larrys: working on a branch will require to resolve that conflict when you merge... have you read the svn book?
16:24  infid: a lot of it not all
16:25  infid: actually the more i read it the more confused i get because i was reading it yesterday and it was saying to make sure to have a 'clean' working copy that's why i'm asking
16:26  infid: i think it was in the 'svn switch' section that it said that
16:26  infid: and it said svn switch is like svn update
16:34 @peterS: yeah, both 'switch' and 'update' will try to merge your local changes with the incoming changes.  if there's a conflict, you have to resolve it.  but as larrys said, you'd have to anyway if you were working in two different branches and then tried to merge between them.
16:34  infid: ok, thanks for clearing that up
16:34 @peterS: so the only way to avoid merge conflicts entirely is to make sure you're never working in parallel with someone else who may be working in the same areas
16:34 @peterS: otherwise, in general, multiple branches are just a way to _delay_ the work of merging and conflict resolution, not _prevent_ it
16:35 @peterS: it can also be said that if you work in the same branch (typically 'trunk'), you should update often, so that when conflicts happen, the thing you're working on that caused the conflict is still fresh in your mind and easy to resolve
16:36 @peterS: in my experience, resolving conflicts sooner is almost always easier than later
16:37 @peterS: or, in buzzword terms, continuous integration is easier than waterfall, when it comes to conflict resolution (:
18:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#svn +o DannyB]
18:14  jMCg: I have an svn:external defintion of a directory, containing a number of files, and I'd like to convert it (back) into a local directory, since I need edits that are specific to my use-case only.
