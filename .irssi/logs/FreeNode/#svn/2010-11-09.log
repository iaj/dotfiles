09:17  Whiskey: ???
09:47  Whiskey: stupid subversion
09:48  IcePic: programs are stupid, they do what we tell them to, not what we want them to do.
09:49  Whiskey: i donÂ´t get svn export to work in a batch file
09:49  Whiskey: it just gives me errors
09:50  Whiskey: svn export "file:///c:/Program%20Files%20%28x86%29/Apache%20Software%20Foundation/Apache2.2/subversion/repositories/prebot" C:/Test --force
09:50  Whiskey: but it works good from the run or from normal cmd
09:50  Whiskey: but not on a batch file
09:51  IcePic: then the batch file parser doesnt work like the interactive cmd.
09:51  Whiskey: how to slove that
09:52  IcePic: I also think that posting the particular error would be a waste. I mean, if the error was "svn: No such command" then you would know that the batch file has another environment than you do when typing manually and you need to supply the full path to svn.exe
09:52  IcePic: but since we are not allowed to see the error, its impossible to tell.
09:55  Whiskey: well
09:55  Whiskey: i have try to most stuff it says
09:55  Whiskey: "svn: Unable to open an ra_local session to URL
09:55  Whiskey: svn: Unable to open repository 'file:///development/hdk/hendrickdekeyser.nl/trunk'
09:55  Whiskey: not my dir but same error
09:58  IcePic: sorry, I'm out of here. I have no time for playing secret games of "I wont show you my error". Hope you find someone else to play 20 questions with you.
09:58  Whiskey: well
09:58  Whiskey: i show you what the error was?
10:01  Whiskey: lol
10:01  Whiskey: almost got it

10:02  wayita: sacho: undo is done using 'svn merge' or 'svn copy': http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo
10:05  Whiskey: u git ut working
10:05  Whiskey: i got it working
10:05  Whiskey: but how to run it from post-commit

13:24  [eXception]: hi
13:25  [eXception]: when I merge a branch into the trunk, how can I do this without adding merge-properties?
13:25  [eXception]: I only want the structural text-changes
13:27  [eXception]: should I delete recursively svn:mergeinfo?

15:32  ultramage: Hi, are good usage rules for svn:externals documented somewhere?
15:32 --- Channel #svn was synced in 123 seconds
15:33  ultramage: for svk, I noticed that it does not handle svn:externals; using symlinks is a good workaround, but it's not immediately obvious what should be symlinked where
15:34  ultramage: so I thought of writing a shell script that would crawl the repository, looking for svn:externals props, and doing something - maybe writing a .txt file listing the externals, or maybe even doing the symlinking automagically
15:35  ultramage: I wonder if it's possible to achieve compatibility this way... for example, setting svn:ignore on those dirs that are to be pulled via svn:externals
