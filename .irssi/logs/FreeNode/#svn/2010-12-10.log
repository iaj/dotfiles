15:42 --- Channel #svn was synced in 1 seconds
15:43  iaj: lo there... when Im on a svn-directory and there are files that are not tracked   git status lists them all preceded by a ?   any way I can totally not show those?
15:52 @danielsh: wrong channel?

16:00  saml: svn status shows M foo/bar.txt          but   svn diff foo/bar.txt  shows nothing because my diff-cmd     is  some script that does /usr/bin/diff -w "$6" "$7"     ..   can I use my script when svn status reports modification?
16:00  saml: Basically, I want foo/bar.txt  to not have M status when I invoke `svn status`
16:28  iaj: danielsh: sorry I ment svn status
16:39  rhl: Is there a way to make svn automatically email us when there are new commits?
16:40 @danielsh: iaj: --quiet
16:41  IcePic: rhl: there are numerous post-commit scripts that send emails from the svn server when someone commits.
16:41  IcePic: I even think the svn distribution comes with at least one, if not more
16:42  rhl: IcePic, cool so my sys-admin should be able to find it?
16:43  rhl: well, you can't know the answer to that
16:43  rhl: lol
16:44  iaj: Hmmm I just created a file ignore.txt  with the contents .classpath (should refer to a file) in it.. however after propset and using that file git status still shows me the file as MODIFIED
16:49  joel: might want to try #git?
17:13  dknight: when I am trying to commit from a folder I used to commit regularly, I am getting a message asking me password for 'default' login for GNOME-keyring. I am unable to understand why GNOME-keyring is being queried.
17:14 @peterS: dknight: because apparently you're running the gnome-keyring daemon.  or the svn auth storage plugin thinks you are.
17:15 @danielsh: ... and svn wants to store your password encrypted in the keyring rather than in a plaintext file on disk.
17:15  dknight: peterS: well the config file has gnome-keyring part commented out
17:15 @peterS: dknight: if you don't want to use gnome-keyring, you can override the auth storage backend config in ~/.subversion/config, look for 'password-stores = ', uncomment it, and edit it
17:15 @peterS: dknight: yeah, commented out means use default list, which includes gnome-keyring
17:15  dknight: peterS: okay
17:16 @peterS: anyway yeah, it's for your protection (tm).  as danielsh says, gnome-keyring at least encrypts your stuff, whereas plain svn can't.
17:17  dknight: peterS: okay keep that in mind
17:23  dknight: peterS, danielsh: thank you
18:12  silveira_neto: I have a simple question. I did a update like this "svn update -r 568 folder" so that folder come to be like it was in the revision 568 (diferente files, subfolders etc). Now I want to commit this folder, but when I try to svn commit it is like there is no modification. How can I force the remote version of this folder (now at 590) to be like the version 568?

18:15  wayita: silveira_neto: undo is done using 'svn merge' or 'svn copy': http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo
18:15  IcePic: that is how you make HEAD look like revision X
