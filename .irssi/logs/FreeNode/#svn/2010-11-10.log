10:37  Whiskey: where do you config where to save the repos?`
10:47  Hyperi: With what ?
10:47  Hyperi: mkdir /svnroot
10:47  Hyperi: svnadmin create /svnroot
10:48  Hyperi: Or if you want multi-repositories, you do mkdir /svnroot/my_project
10:48  Hyperi: then svnadmin create /svnroot/my_proejct
10:48  Hyperi: And you make /svnroot/ as SVNParentPath
10:49  Hyperi: Whiskey: Is that what you were looking for? :>
10:50  Whiskey: dunno
10:50  Whiskey: i just wanne know how it knows where the svn root is
10:50  Whiskey: and how to set it
10:52  Hyperi: What knows what ?
10:52  Hyperi: Apache ?
10:53  Whiskey: not sure i try see if it works

11:37  dgtlmoon: does svn copy (im using it to make a new tag) literally copy the files on the filesystem?
11:37  dgtlmoon: its a very very large project *5gb of code)
11:42  Whiskey: damn
11:42  spetrea: can I make a request to the subversion server so that it gives me a diff between 2 specific revisions ?
11:53 @peterS: spetrea: svn diff --help
11:54 @peterS: what you want is two URLs with @NNNN suffixes
11:58  Hyperi: dgtlmoon: I tried that with TortoiseSVN and it failed, dropped some files
11:58  dgtlmoon: Hyperi, works ok from command line
11:58  dgtlmoon: so, im thinking, i have a tagged checkout in /var/www/mysite/TheSVNCode, can i just "svn update -rNEW_TAG" on that checked out code?
11:59  dgtlmoon: like, how do i switch running code (say for a website) to a different tag?

12:11  dgtlmoon: peterS, literally with the carrot?
12:11  dgtlmoon: cool, that makes sense
12:12 --- Channel #svn was synced in 136 seconds
12:12 @peterS: (well, 'caret' not 'carrot') - yes, ^/ is an abbreviation for the URL corresponding to the root of the current repository
12:12  dgtlmoon: so i do like, svn checkout https://svn.server.org/myproject/tags/MYTAG ?
12:13  dgtlmoon: and then svn switch.. ?
12:13  dgtlmoon: mv MYTAG httpdocs
12:13  dgtlmoon: cd httpdocs
12:13 @peterS: well
12:13  dgtlmoon: svn switch ^/tags/newtag
12:14  dgtlmoon: peterS, hmm im not sure if i am making sense
12:14 @peterS: first off, if you know the tag you want before you start, just check that out to begin with
12:14  dgtlmoon: yes but basically the problem is, i have some running code i want to update to the latest tag
12:14 @peterS: second, no need to 'mv MYTAG httpdocs', you can just add 'httpdocs' to the end of your svn checkout command
12:14  dgtlmoon: for example a website with a heap of PHP
12:14  dgtlmoon: aahuh
12:14  dgtlmoon: ok
12:15 @peterS: but to switch between tags, yes, 'svn switch ^/tags/foobar' is short for 'svn switch https://svn.server.org/myproject/tags/foobar'
12:15 @peterS: assuming https://svn.server.org/myproject is the root of the repository
12:15  dgtlmoon: yes
12:16  dgtlmoon: peterS, could i svn switch -rHEAD ?
12:17 @peterS: dgtlmoon: tags and revisions, in svn, are two completely different concepts
12:17  dgtlmoon: peterS, does svn copy literally copy the files?
12:17 @peterS: so yes you can specify -rHEAD in a switch, but that doesn't have anything to do with which branch or tag you're switching to - just means you're getting the newest piece of whatever branch you pick
12:18  dgtlmoon: ok, well im thinking of just managing what code the site is running with tags
12:18  dgtlmoon: as its just a heap of PHP and images
12:18  dgtlmoon: i can tell the developers to commit a new tag of the code when they are happy and tested and then i will just svn switch the production code on the webserver
12:19  dgtlmoon: what do you think of my scheme?
12:19  IcePic: switching to a tag to get to a known state is a fine idea. If you dont ever commit to the tag, it will never matter which rev of the repo there is, the tag will stay the same regardless.
12:19  IcePic: dgtlmoon: so yes, that is a fine idea.
12:19  dgtlmoon: yes the plan is just commit to the tag once (to create the tag)
12:20  dgtlmoon: and every /tag/new_tag must have all of the code 'svn copy' into it right?
12:22  IcePic: right.
12:29  IcePic: do mind that tags and branches in svn are very cheap, like softlinks in file systems, so its fast and easy to create lots of tags for all points in history you want to mark
13:27  Skaag: Hello there the nice people of #svn :-)
13:30  IcePic: can't be me, I'm a whiney old stiff svn guy. =)
13:31  Renter: you're not stiff, you're platonically challenged
13:32  IcePic: you're not stiff <- thats what she said!
13:38  ghufran: hi. i need some help with recovering a file. i deleted it accidentally and now cant recover it. svn st says its deleted. but i havent committed it. svn up doesnot appear to work
13:40  ghufran: nevermind. fixed it.
13:43  Renter: IcePic: yes, yes she did
13:44  Whiskey: hmm
13:44  Whiskey: when a svn is commited
13:44  Whiskey: or no
13:44  Whiskey: can you export an svn to ftp?
13:45  Renter: svnmirror
13:45  Renter: again
13:46  Whiskey: svn mirror?
13:48  Whiskey: btw
13:48  Whiskey: i have in my a dosent matter
13:48  Whiskey: i have like this
13:50  Whiskey: C:\Program Files\WinRar\rar.exe" a -r -ep1 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\www\project\project-svn-%date%.zip" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Project\"
13:50  Whiskey: in my hook/post-commit
13:50  Whiskey: are it anyway to get it to zip like this
13:50  Whiskey: C:\Program Files\WinRar\rar.exe" a -r -ep1 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\www\project\project-svn-%rev%.zip" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Project\"
13:51  Whiskey: to get it to zip all revisions
13:52  Whiskey: but have no clue how to get revision number in to the post-commit
14:17  Renter: er, don't you get it as parameter?
14:18  Renter: set rev=%2
14:21  Whiskey: yeh
14:22  Whiskey: i found that out :)
14:22  Whiskey: tested that yesterday but of some reason i dident got it to work
14:22  doxick: i have just installed subversion and for some reason i can access it through the web address but when i use tortoisesvn to do a full checkout i get an access forbidden. anybody knows how to fix that ?

14:35  sbs: hi
14:36  sbs: I have mistakenly commited a change in a branch, inseatd of the trunk. Is there an "easy way" to get a patch of this commit to apply it where it should have been in the first place?
14:53  Whiskey: hmm
14:53  Whiskey: is it possible to setup commit rules?
14:53  Whiskey: like if i will every commit to be like
14:53  Whiskey: Fixed: $massage ($id) can i set it to just approval that one?
14:54  sbs: that's what hooks are for. Yo ucan set a pre-commit hook to check the message and reject if it is not properly formatted
14:55  Whiskey: can you give me an exampel
14:55  Whiskey: or where i can read about it
14:55  sbs: google for svn empty message commit
14:55  sbs: there are plenty of samples for that
14:55  sbs: you'll have to adapt the rule to check your message format
14:56  sbs: the scripting language will depend on your server's platform
14:56  Whiskey: looks complicated
14:57  TomyLobo: hi
14:57  TomyLobo: which windows command line client do you recommend?
14:57  TomyLobo: something without background tasks etc
15:00  Whiskey: the exampel dosent work
15:03  sbs: the principle is simple you use svnlook to grab the commit log message then "parse" that message an see if it fit your rule
15:03  sbs: the exit code of your script tells svn to commit or rollback the transaction
15:08  Whiskey: yeh but do like
15:08  Whiskey: Fixed: $massage (number)
15:08  Whiskey: seeems relly complicated to do
15:08  Whiskey: i don´t understand a shit of the exampels :(
15:42  doxick: when using an svn client i get "svn: access to '/~svn/repository/!svn/vcc/default' forbidden" while i can access the repository through the web, anybody has an idea of what could be going wrong ?

17:07  abstrakt: ok so I'm reading svn help cp
17:07  abstrakt: and it says
17:07  abstrakt: usage: copy SRC[@REV]... DST
17:08  abstrakt: if I used, for example svn copy file:///repo@1329 would that copy everything from revision 0 through revision 1329?
17:08  abstrakt: or what happens there?
17:08  abstrakt: it copies that branch, as it is in that state?
17:13  IcePic: abstrakt: it notes that the destination has the same ancestry as the source, but when you change it later, it will store "this is like repo@1329 with these four lines added to file X and remove file Y"
17:14 --- sno_ is now known as sno
17:15  BBonifield: Ok admittedly, this is probably a server config issue, not svn, but i'm still stumped.  i have a variety of different clients, all updating from the same source repo.  i try to run "sudo -u apache -H svn list https://domain.com/repos/myrepo".  One client will auth just fine, while the other gives me the "Error validating server certificate" error.  the thing is, though, i can hit 'p' to accept
17:15  BBonifield: the certificantly permanently, but yet, it's never remembered.
17:16  abstrakt: IcePic: hmm, I'm sorry but that doesn't quite make sense to me, I don't follow, what's what?
17:16  abstrakt: IcePic: oh wait, ok I think I get what you're saying now
17:17  IcePic: abstrakt: so yes, a svn copy will "freeze" the state as of repo@1329, though you could develop on that branch also
17:18  abstrakt: IcePic: ok, just checking that I don't need to provide something like REV@23:1497 or whatever
17:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#svn +o kfogel]
17:18  abstrakt: IcePic: I guess it makes sense though, it'll just freeze the state of that revision, so obviously that revision will have all the changes made prior to it, so there's no need to explicitly include previous revision numbers
17:19  IcePic: abstrakt: but also, the copy will keep the ancestry so you can follow the shared history from either point
17:19  abstrakt: IcePic: yup, ok got it thanks
17:22  BBonifield: Bottom line, it seems like SVN is either looking in the wrong place for previous cert auths or it isn't storing them.  I'm relatively certain it's because of the '-H' flag i'm sending with sudo, but that's necessary since apache isn't a true user with it's own svn config

21:12  svnnoob: do I have to set eol:style property on the svn server?  Or can I set it on my local checkout and all files checked out into the directory will be that eol:style?
21:13  larrys: you don't set svn:eol-style on the directory, you set it on the files. And you should commit that property change back to the repo.
21:14  svnnoob: aaah ok
21:14  svnnoob: well what if i want to set it on all *.php files inside the directory
21:14  larrys: see http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.auto
21:15  svnnoob: svn propset eol:style native -r /dir/?
21:15  larrys: but yes, you would need to set it on each file, and then if you have auto-props setup on the client(s), then you will get it for free with new files.
