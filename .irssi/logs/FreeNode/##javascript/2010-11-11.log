11:21  iaj: lo there
11:21 --- Channel ##javascript was synced in 2 seconds
11:23  iaj: how would I have a download dialog window for a pdf file - for now its offering a download window on my mac, but on my windows machine (firefox) its opening the pdf file in the same window and viewing it.
11:23  gls\Fr4NgUs: thx
11:25  bob2423: np
11:25  stride: iaj: does your server send a Content-Disposition header for the file?
11:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: ok
11:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: bob
11:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: latast question
11:26  gls\Fr4NgUs: i want set value of slider to 1
11:26  gls\Fr4NgUs: because the value =0 at start page
11:26 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
11:26  philk__: is it possible to override window.navigator.userAgent from script?
11:27  bob2423: gls\Fr4NgUs: what start page?
11:28  iaj: stride: I don't know.. how can I find out :D
11:28  gls\Fr4NgUs: ok
11:28  gls\Fr4NgUs: no
11:28  gls\Fr4NgUs: i want
11:29  gls\Fr4NgUs: the start value of slider is 1
11:29  bob2423: gls\Fr4NgUs: it is starting at 1
11:33  iaj: stride: I added a line to my .htaccess AddType application/octet-stream .pdf
11:33  iaj: but its still opening the file within the same window
11:34  stride: iaj: google for "force download pdf files apache" and hit the I feel lucky button
11:34  stride: iaj: if that one doesn't help, I guess your browser wont change its behaviour
11:35  Evelynn: Does JS support "iif": (condition) ? true : false
11:35  stride: Evelynn: yep
11:35  Evelynn: stride: ty
11:36  iaj: stride: the example one there - then it will start automatically popping up the download dialog as soon as one opens the page.. doesn't it?
11:37  saschagehlich: huh, when I do new Date("Wed Feb 11 08:21:48 +0000 2009") in Chrome it creates a new Date object. In IE it is NaN? Why is that and how can I convert it to a Date object?
11:37  stride: iaj: as soon as one navigates to the pdf file
11:37  Teratogen: how do I detect an onRightClick on a button?
11:37  iaj: stride: so I just have to insert that php sheet to my page and adjust the readfile part?
11:39  stride: iaj: http://www.thingy-ma-jig.co.uk/blog/06-08-2007/force-a-pdf-to-download you configure your apache to send those headers
11:44  ddilinger: i'm failing at something here ... in the firebug console why does '( 555'.replace(/^[0-9]/, '') return '( 555' instead of stripping non-numbers?
11:45  iaj: stride: thanks.. can you guide me where I can find the apache config file where I have to input that?
11:47  stride: iaj: that depends on your system, usually somewhere in /etc/httpd/* or /etc/apache2/*
11:55  drey-: ddilinger: if you're still wondering, the ^ outside of the collection looks for strings beginning with a digit, move the ^ inside to use it as not a digit, you'll also want to add a g after the last / to make it global
12:11  rue: (That is, ^ in the regexp means the beginning of the line whereas [^] is the negative version of [])\
12:12  jankoprowski: Hi
12:12  jankoprowski: I'm wondering
12:12  jankoprowski: Is there any official JavaScript reference?
12:17  yak[work]: jankoprowski: MDC can be considered as such
12:18  jankoprowski: yak[work]: Thanks
12:18  ddilinger: yea, i would refer to mdc as well
12:18  jankoprowski: I hear that Adobe had some pretty good Python similar ECMA proposition
12:18  jankoprowski: But Microsfot doesn't agree
12:18  jankoprowski: Is it true?
12:19  yak[work]: Considering Microsoft doesn't usually agree to anything "open" or "standardized"... :P.
12:20  jankoprowski: I'm dreaming about JavaScript more Python similar
12:20  jankoprowski: Or something
12:20  yak[work]: Why. Javascript is awesome as it is. Bar crossbrowser issues that is.
12:20  jankoprowski: The biggest Pain in the ass is really poor build in Objects
12:20  ddilinger: ooh, always more wheels to reinvent :)
12:21  Sorella: jankoprowski: you mean http://www.skulpt.org/ ? ;3
12:21  jankoprowski: First time in my live heard about this
12:21  jankoprowski: Is it something what is "usable"
12:22  Sorella: I like javascript as a language tho. It's pretty neat, except the prototypal inheritance implementation is still meh.
12:22  jankoprowski: Sorella: It is acceptable after extending by something
12:23  jankoprowski: Sorella: e.g. ExtJS, Underscore or anything else what add sens to use build in objects
12:23  philk__: how do I get the correct UTC date using new Date()? It seems to be 1 hour off now
12:23  Thomas`-: hey guys -  could anyone help me make a recursive timeout function.  i can post the code i have that doesn't work
12:23  Sorella: I'd like it to be more like x = {__proto__: {a: 1, b: 2}}, but it's not standard .-.
12:24  Sorella: Thomas`-: why recursive?
12:24  Sorella: `doesn't work @ Thomas`-
12:24  jsBot: Thomas`-: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
12:24  rue: jankoprowski: You could try coffeescript
12:25  jankoprowski: rue: I will notice this
12:25  Thomas`-: var tm; function fn() { tm = setTimeout("fn()", 1500); } fn();
12:25  rue: Though I suppose it is slightly more Ruby-like than Python-like
12:25  Thomas`-: something like this: firefox tells me fn() is not defined
12:25  Thomas`-: Sorella, for a slideshow
12:25  jankoprowski: Is skuplt compiling to JavaScript?
12:26  jankoprowski: Or this is Python syntax implemented on the to of JavaScript?
12:26  Thomas`-: Sorella  do you know of another way i could do it ?
12:27  FGRibreau: Thomas: why don't you do:
12:27  FGRibreau: var fn = function(){
12:27  FGRibreau: setTimeout(function(){
12:27  FGRibreau:   fn();
12:27  FGRibreau: }, 1500);
12:27  FGRibreau: }
12:27  FGRibreau:    
12:27  FGRibreau: fn();
12:27  temp01: setTimeout(fn, 1500);
12:28  FGRibreau: temp01 +1
12:28  Thomas`-: thanks i'll try
12:35  Juandev: hi
12:36  Juandev: I am less than begginer in JavaScript and right now, I am having one script in MediaWiki to import stylesheets for every single page
12:38  v_y: can i detect changes to the current urls #hash tag?
12:38  Juandev: it is something like importStylesheet("MediaWiki:Page/"+wgPageName+".css"); which for page Dog imports the stylesheet from MediaWiki:Page/Dog.css
12:38  v_y: some window event or something
12:38  FGRibreau: v_y: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
12:38  Juandev: Would it be possible to write a script which would import one stylesheet for e.g. twenty pages?
12:39  henrikkok: Juandev: like a counter og twenty specific pages?
12:40  henrikkok: like a section
12:41  Juandev: well, if you wanna style 20 pages using a same styl, it losts the sence each time to multiply your stylesheet 20 times
12:41  Juandev: henrikkok: but yes, 20 specific pages
12:44  henrikkok: Juandev: if you are using server side scripts (php, asp etc.) you could just include the script there. But if you only have frontend code - you could look at the url and use the document.write('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />');
12:44  henrikkok: wrap it in an if-statement
12:45 * Juandev looks what is counter og
12:54  henrikkok: Juandev: you could use the window.location.hash and just append the hash to the url you would like to use the specific stylesheet
12:55  henrikkok: if ('#special' === window.location.hash) { document.write('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />'); }
12:55  Juandev: difficult
12:56  henrikkok: pretty simple
12:56  henrikkok: yourpage.com/index.html does not load the stylesheet but yourpage.com/index.html#special
12:56  henrikkok: does
12:56 * Juandev look deeper
12:57  Juandev: henrikkok: and how that script identife the page?
12:57  henrikkok: by looking at the hash
12:58  henrikkok: you change #special to whatever you want
12:58  bob2423: henrikkok: whats the difference between ('#special' === window.location.hash) and (window.location.hash == '#special')
12:58  FernandoBasso: I have "var my_var;" then an "if (my_var) { alert('Variable defined'); } doesn't get executed. Is this correct?
12:58  FernandoBasso: Neither if I have "var my_var = '';
13:00  henrikkok: bob2423: the result will be the same. But it's bad practice to use the "==" identifier.
13:00  henrikkok: because javascript has some funky quirks.
13:02  Juandev: henrikkok: so it could be than if ('dog, cat, Wikipedia:About us' === window.location.hash) { document.write('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="MediaWiki:WebPages/style.css" />'); } ?
13:02  bob2423: ok ty
13:03  henrikkok: Juandev: that would not work - you can not make a comma seperated list. I don't know the specific limitations in the .hash property - but i'm pretty sure its one word and _-
13:06  Juandev: henrikkok: so how I connect more names of pages? or I cannot do that in that script? e.g. #dog.#cat.#Wikipedia:About us
13:07  henrikkok: FernandoBasso: the is one of the quirks with javascript - you could set my_var to true or something. Or use this: if (typeof my_var === 'undefined')
13:08  FernandoBasso: What is the correct way to call: "var my_var;" and "var my_var = ''; (and empty string) ?
13:09  FernandoBasso: (empty, null, undefined, false) What is the correct ?
13:09  henrikkok: Juandev:  you could it by adding the or (||) like ('#dog' === window.location.href) || ('#cat' === window.location.href)… but that it not very pretty i would recommend you to look at arrays and check if the hash exists in the array.
13:09  henrikkok: var my_var; is equal to undefined
13:09  yak[work]: Juandev: Array.indexOf, like ['page1', 'page2', 'page3'].indexOf('page1') != -1   Be sure to implement that function for the browsers that don't support it though.
13:10  Juandev: ok thx
13:10  FernandoBasso: The DOM inspector simply says that var my_var = '' is "".
13:11  yak[work]: FernandoBasso: JS doesn't doe strict value types, so initializeing a var with an emty string is fine for all cases.
13:11  yak[work]: *do
13:11  henrikkok: FernandoBasso: try to alert it and you'll see.
13:11  FernandoBasso: What is the difference between initializing a var with = '' or = true ?
13:11  FernandoBasso: Would the "effect" be the same?
13:12  ddilinger: not really, the value of the variable is different
13:13  FernandoBasso: Alerting my_var; my_var = ''; and my_var = true; helps.
13:14  FernandoBasso: Three different resutls. Indeed.
13:14  Teratogen: how do I detect an onRightClick on a button?
13:14  ddilinger: FernandoBasso: in the code you pasted above you were trying to test if a variable is defined or not, the thing is javascript doesn't really have that
13:14  FernandoBasso: ddilinger: Okay. Thanks.
13:15  RiaGuy: Can you recommend the most advanced IDE for JavaScript editing and debugging?
13:15  Teratogen: vim
13:15  ddilinger: vim +1
13:15  FernandoBasso: vim +1
13:16  FernandoBasso: Aptana is fine, but I can't stand the text editor, though.
13:16  RiaGuy: anything more convinient than Visual Studio 2010?
13:16  Hishi_wrk: Hello ppl. if i have 3 input fields, 3 depends on the value in field 2 and 2 depends on the value of field 1. How should i make it so the changes to input field 1 gets reflected in field 3?
13:16  Teratogen: vim + firefox
13:17  ddilinger: i like chrome's debugger, but firefox is nice too :)
13:17  FernandoBasso: I'm still learning to use firebug. I'm failing. :(
13:18  RiaGuy: are you guys on unix?
13:18  FernandoBasso: I run arch linux and ubuntu.
13:19  ddilinger: i'm on linux as well, but you dont need linux for vim
13:19  FernandoBasso: I wonder if that MDC JavaScript Reference has a pdf for download.
13:20  FernandoBasso: ddilinger: Do you agree that vim "fits" better on linux than it does on windows?
13:20  ddilinger: FernandoBasso: i wouldn't know
13:21  FernandoBasso: I can't find some things in MDC js reference. In php.net it is so easy.
13:21  ddilinger: FernandoBasso: i mean, for the average windows user(my mother) vim is useless, but for a programmer with a keen eye twords reducing repetition and using their programming ability not only in the code but to write the code, i think it should work as well on both
13:22  RiaGuy: did you ever tried Visual Studio 2010?
13:22  FernandoBasso: I have a friend who was forced to work on windows, and some regexps that work for me, don't for him. Like: :%s:^\s*\zs\(.\):\l\1:
13:24  FernandoBasso: He needed to change all first chars from lower to upper case. Some of them had white spaces and tabs in front of. Works here, and don't for him.
13:24  FernandoBasso: RiaGuy: I don't have windows installed.
13:24  FernandoBasso: I have on VirtualBox, to tell the truth.
13:27  FernandoBasso: RiaGuy: vim, snipMate.vim, autoclose.vim do most of what I need.
13:27  Teratogen: Fernando, uhm, shouldn't matter if it is windows or not
13:27  Teratogen: what matters is the browser
13:28  FernandoBasso: Teratogen: Yeah. The browser is critical.
13:28  Teratogen: so why did you mention windows?
13:28  Teratogen: windows is an operating system
13:28  ddilinger: other was asking about MSVS2010
13:29  FernandoBasso: I only said that that regex that work here, didn't work on vim running on a windows machine. I don't now why.
13:29  Teratogen: oh
13:29  FernandoBasso: Or perhaps my friend mistyped it, or somehting.
13:29  Teratogen: ooooooooooh regex in VIM
13:30  fruitwerks: two of my worst enemies lol
13:30  FernandoBasso: fruitwerks: Why?
13:31  fruitwerks: half the time I can't even get out vim after accedentally starting it somewhow, and regex is like trying to read braile to me
13:32  FernandoBasso: fruitwerks: Yeah. I agree that both are not intuitive. Nothing that can't be learned, though.
13:33  FernandoBasso: I find learning the IDEs features to be difficult.
13:33  FernandoBasso: I don't understand how their text editor works. I allays mess the code.
13:34  fruitwerks: I'm a nano guy... so far kdevelop works for coding.. not the best - or smart, but I dig it
13:34  bohl: i have a function(str){jQuery("#foo").click(function(){alert(str)}).focus(function(){alert(str)})}; as you see the "same" function is bound to 2 events, but this function needs to be anonymous so var "str" is available. is there a way to refactor this, so that i don't have to write alert(str) twice?
13:34 * FireFly <3 kate
13:34  fruitwerks: I tried all the big IDE's just overkill or unstable or clunky
13:35 * fruitwerks has never tried kate actually
13:35  Teratogen: how do I find the largest integer that javascript can have?
13:35  Teratogen: not the largest number
13:35  Teratogen: just the largest integer
13:35  Teratogen: fruitwerks, emacs
13:35  bohl: Teratogen: there's no int in jscript
13:36  Teratogen: bohl, it is floats all the way down?
13:36  bohl: Teratogen: double
13:36  Teratogen: so, 64 bits?
13:36  FireFly: bohl, function(str) {var f = function() {alert(str)}; jQuery("#foo").click(f).focus(f)}} ?
13:37  Teratogen: double is 64 bit floats right?
13:37  bohl: FireFly: darn, looks like i forgot that "var".. again :(
13:37  FireFly: Teratogen, yep
13:37  Teratogen: so I wonder what the biggest floating point integer is without losing any "accuracy"
13:37  FireFly: tectonic, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision for the standard
13:37  FireFly: 2^53 IIRC
13:38  FireFly: Hmm
13:38  FireFly: 2^52*
13:39  FireFly: js> var i = Math.pow(2, 52), j = i-1; i == j
13:39  gbot2: FireFly: false
13:39  FireFly: js> var i = Math.pow(2, 53), j = i-1; i == j
13:39  gbot2: FireFly: false
13:39  FireFly: js> var i = Math.pow(2, 54), j = i-1; i == j
13:39  gbot2: FireFly: true
13:40  Teratogen: so 2^53
13:40  FireFly: Apparently
13:41  Teratogen: js> var i = Math.pow(2, 53), j = i+1; i == j
13:41  gbot2: Teratogen: true
13:41  Teratogen: hmmmmmmmm
13:41  FireFly: js> var i = Math.pow(2, -43), j = i-1; i == j
13:41  gbot2: FireFly: false
13:41  FireFly: js> var i = Math.pow(2, -53), j = i-1; i == j
13:41  gbot2: FireFly: false
13:45  Teratogen: too bad javascript doesn't allow _ in numbers
13:45  Teratogen: so that you can group them
13:45  Teratogen: e.g.
13:45  Teratogen: 12_345_678
13:45  Teratogen: group digits
13:45  FireFly: I think that's a suggested change for ES5
13:48  Maxdamantus: Group?
13:48  Maxdamantus: Just for formatting?
13:48  FireFly: Simply syntactic sugar to make it easier to read long number literals
13:48  ddilinger: Maxdamantus: make them more readable in source code
13:49  FireFly: Yeah
13:49 * Maxdamantus has a language where _ negates the number constant.
13:49  FireFly: I think J does that
13:52  burntout: ello
13:52  burntout: whats wrong with this?
13:52  burntout: document.getElementById(id).style.background-color="#ffd3bb";
13:52  FireFly: that you're trying to subtract undefined from the background property
13:52  FireFly: try backgroundColor
13:52  burntout: ah
13:52  Maxdamantus: - produces not an lvalue.
13:55  burntout: wonderfull!
13:55  burntout: mucho thanks:)
13:56  davidw: if I do var i; function a() { .... print value of i ... }; and then change i, a() will print the new value.  Is there a way to copy the *current* value of i so that it remains that in a() ?
13:56  FireFly: You have to store it in a temporary variable
13:57  FireFly: var j = i; ...print value of i
13:57  FireFly: err
13:57  FireFly: of j*
13:57  Maxdamantus: I don't think that's what he's asking.
13:58  FireFly: Hm
13:58  Maxdamantus: davidw: return the function from a closure that you pass i into
13:59  Maxdamantus: eg: var a = (function(i){ return function(){ .... print value of i ... }; })(i);
13:59  Maxdamantus: Maybe function a on the inner-most one, to be more similar.
14:00  Maxdamantus: Actually, that would be less similar.
14:04  davidw: Maxdamantus, that does the trick nicely - thankyou!

14:24  tuxnani: hi anyone to help me?
14:24  loxs: Now, you will probably call me stupid (and Python too), but why the hell doesn't   'some string' * 20   work in JS?
14:25  Maxdamantus: It does. It yields the value NaN
14:25  loxs: well, I wouldn't call that "work" :)
14:25  Maxdamantus: I would.
14:26  Maxdamantus: What do you expect it to do?
14:26  loxs: in python  'a' * 2    returns 'aa'
14:26  Maxdamantus: What would "42" * 4 do?
14:26  loxs: '424242'
14:26  loxs: *for times, not 3
14:26  drey-: 42424242
14:26  Maxdamantus: js> "42" * 4
14:26  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 168
14:27  loxs: uhm, yeah, weak typing, damn
14:27  Maxdamantus: Not weak.
14:27  Maxdamantus: Duck typing.
14:27  loxs: I really prefer when I tell it that '42' is a string, that it treats it as a string :)
14:28  mainiak: Hi
14:29  mainiak: I am having strange error in FF - that when i have <applet> pair directly in <body>, then JS document.applets[0].func() works, but when "I push tag deeper", then it doesn't
14:29  mainiak: any clue?
14:30  Maxdamantus: js> [42]*4
14:30  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 168
14:30  Maxdamantus: js> [42,123]*4
14:30  gbot2: Maxdamantus: NaN
14:31 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:35 --- Tprice is now known as tprice
14:37  _sudo: regardless of duck typing, javascript it weakly typed.
14:37  poppiez: hi, I'm thinking of using Explorer Canvas to do some pageflipping. however, before I get started I'd like to know if any of you have any insight to how IE6 and IE7 will perform when doing the flipping? if it's too poor, I won't bother starting
14:37  Maxdamantus: Indeed, but the duck-ness is why "42"*4 == 168
14:37  Maxdamantus: and why [42]*4 is too.
14:38  Maxdamantus: js> ({toString: function() 42}) + 4
14:38  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 46
14:40  _sudo: I would argue "42"*4 is an example of weak typing since it is doing type conversion.
14:40  Maxdamantus: Define "conversion" in Javascript terms.
14:41  Maxdamantus: imo JS is a bad example of a weakly-typed language.
14:41  Maxdamantus: I would say most of the things like that are the cause of duck-typing, not weak.
14:42  Maxdamantus: An example of why it's weakly typed is that it doesn't care what type of values you add to an object.
14:42  _sudo: Duck typing is a form of dynamic typing, which has nothing to do with type conversion.
14:42  Maxdamantus: But most of the operators involve internal methods called "ToString" or something.
14:42  loxs: Maxdamantus, it's really sick  10 + "123"  is "10123" but 10 * "123" is 1230.
14:44  Maxdamantus: Or what type of values you pass to a function.
14:44  Maxdamantus: in Haskell, which is strongly typed, you can add an instance for String * Number
14:45  Maxdamantus: and you'll be able to define what happens when you apply the * operator to a string and a number.
14:45  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
14:46  tuxnani: please someone help me out
14:47  _sudo: which, if you implemented to do a type conversion and return an integer, it would be as if you are adding weak typing :P
14:47  Maxdamantus: That's not weak typing.
14:47  _sudo: but it would act like it
14:48  _sudo: so it may as well be
14:48  Maxdamantus: Perhaps.
14:48  Maxdamantus: But the * operator in JS is defined for every type
14:48  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
14:48  tuxnani: please someone help me out
14:48  Maxdamantus: since it requires the ToString internal method to be called for an operand which is not a number.
14:48  Maxdamantus: or instanceof Number
14:49  _sudo: its doing a type conversion under the hood with no warning/error/etc.  That is weak typing.  Perhaps it is also an example of duck typing, but it is definitely weak.
14:50  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
14:50  tuxnani: please someone help me out
14:50  Maxdamantus: Yes, but the reason why "abcd" * 42 is NaN is to do with duck, not weak.
14:50  Maxdamantus: Weak is the reason why you can pass any type to any operator.
14:51  buscon: Hi, I'm looking for a very simple javascript image gallery
14:52  buscon: there are plenty on the net, and most of them are too much for what I need
14:52  Maxdamantus: You can pass any type to any operator in Python too afaik
14:52  vsrinath: is it possible to crop particular color from image using javascript?
14:52  Maxdamantus: it won't stop you at parse/compile time.
14:52  buscon: I want simply a button to go to next or previous image
14:52  _sudo: v8: parseInt('abcd')
14:52  v8bot: _sudo: NaN
14:52  buscon: that's the onlye requirement
14:52  buscon: *only
14:53  _sudo: Nan * 42 is NaN.  Weak typing
14:53  vsrinath: I know it is possible for particular portion cropping is there, but is
14:53  vsrinath: there a way to crop specific color?
14:53  _sudo: its doing a parseint on abcd
14:53  Maxdamantus: What's that got to do with weak typing?
14:53  _sudo: type conversion
14:53  Maxdamantus: weak/strong has to do with compile-time interception of type-related errors.
14:53  _sudo: to get the first nan it does a parseInt
14:54  Maxdamantus: js> typeof NaN
14:54  gbot2: Maxdamantus: "number"
14:55  _sudo: the string 'abcd' gets converted to NaN which you pointed out is a number
14:55  vsrinath: _sudo: http://www.jibbering.com/faq/notes/type-conversion/
14:55  Maxdamantus: _sudo: yes, via the ToNumber internal function.
14:55  Maxdamantus: _sudo: Python is weakly typed too.
14:55  _sudo: and type conversion with no warning/error is weakly typed
14:56  vsrinath: <_sudo>: http://www.jibbering.com/faq/notes/type-conversion/
14:56  Maxdamantus: It doesn't show the signs of duck typing that JS does.
14:56  Maxdamantus: "42" looks like a number
14:56  Maxdamantus: it sounds like a number
14:56  Maxdamantus: therefore, it is a number.
14:56  KucukMubasir: why does my browser send a request for checking the expire date of every resource, when I refresh the page; but not when I re-type the name of the site to address bar and enter?
14:56  Maxdamantus: Based on what I've seen of Python so far, it treats "42" strictly as a string.
14:56  KucukMubasir: and press enter*
14:56  Maxdamantus: and using a string input to the * operator does not try to interpret it as a number.
14:57  KucukMubasir: .js print typeof "42"
14:57  KucukMubasir: .js write "bla"
14:57  KucukMubasir: >js write "panpa"
14:57  KucukMubasir: js write "peh"
14:57  KucukMubasir: .j print ""
14:57  KucukMubasir: where is the bot?
14:57  Maxdamantus: What's he doing?
14:58  _sudo: v8: typeof "42"
14:58  v8bot: _sudo: "string"
14:58  Maxdamantus: js> print("")
14:58  gbot2: Maxdamantus:
14:58  _sudo: it walks and talks like a string if you ask me
14:58  Maxdamantus: _sudo: when you use it for *
14:58  tuxnani: (\d{3})\D*(\d{3})\D*(\d{4})\D*(\d*)$, does this reg exp work?
14:58  KucukMubasir: js> print typeof("42")
14:58  gbot2: KucukMubasir: Error: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement:  print typeof("42")  ......^
14:58  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
14:58  Maxdamantus: _sudo: duck typing has to do with the behaviours of the operators.
14:58  tuxnani: please someone help me out
14:58  Maxdamantus: weak typing has to do with what happens regarding type checking at compile time.
14:58  KucukMubasir: js> print( typeof "42")
14:58  gbot2: KucukMubasir: Error: SyntaxError: illegal character:  print( typeof "42")  .......^
14:58  KucukMubasir: oeh
14:59  KucukMubasir: js> print( typeof("42"))
14:59  gbot2: KucukMubasir: Error: SyntaxError: illegal character:  print( typeof("42"))  .......^
14:59  KucukMubasir: I give up
14:59  Maxdamantus: The fact that JS treats "42" in a multiplication as 42 is to do with duck typing, not weak typing.
14:59  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
14:59  Maxdamantus: Do you understand?
14:59  tuxnani: please someone help me out
14:59  Maxdamantus: The fact that it doesn't throw an error at compile time is to do with weak typing.
15:00  KucukMubasir: js>alert("d")
15:00  KucukMubasir: js>write("d")
15:00  KucukMubasir: js>print("d")

15:01  gbot2: KucukMubasir: Error: ReferenceError: write is not defined
15:01  _sudo: duck typing has to do with type inference.  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck simply means, if it can do the operation, do it.  It doesn't mean "this string has a number in it so convert it to an integer"
15:02  Maxdamantus: If by inference you mean the characteristic of some static type systems (like Haskell), I disagree.
15:03  _sudo: I am not very familiar with haskell so I can't really respond to that.
15:03  Maxdamantus: What do you know of type inference?
15:03  l4rk: what do i not know
15:04  _sudo: if I say fred = 42 It sees 42 is an int and fred becomes type int
15:04  Maxdamantus: That's basically the opposite of it.
15:05  Maxdamantus: If you say fred = 42, it sees that fred is an int so the expression 42 becomes an int.
15:05  Maxdamantus: (Assuming that fred is an int)
15:05  _sudo: I am talking about creating a variable
15:05  Maxdamantus: (Which should've been inferred/defined beforehand)
15:06  Maxdamantus: Yes.
15:06  _sudo: if fred is an int and you try to set it to a string and fred becomes a string that is weakly typed
15:06  Maxdamantus: Then that's not type inference.
15:07  _sudo: I know
15:07  _sudo: I agree with your example, but in my example I was talking about the declaration, not when fred has a type
15:07  Maxdamantus: Mk.
15:08  _sudo: well sorta 42 doesn't become an int
15:08  _sudo: 42 is already an int
15:08  _sudo: it infers that it is approriate to set
15:09  Maxdamantus: Hm.
15:10  Maxdamantus: In Haskell, if you have (42 * 42 :: Integer), the expression 42*42, has to be an Integer
15:10  Maxdamantus: and for 42*42 to be an Integer, 42 must be an Integer, and 42 must be an Integer.
15:11  Maxdamantus: If you were to change Integer to Float, everything must be a Float.
15:11  Maxdamantus: (Because you can't normally multiply a Float by an Integer)
15:12  Maxdamantus: So the type of each subexpression 42 is inferred by the type expected by the enclosing expression.
15:12  Maxdamantus: and it only really makes sense in static type systems.
15:13 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
15:13  Juandev: why the string doesnt understand to – ?
15:13  _sudo: Strongly typed and Dynamically typed are not mutually exclusive.
15:13  Juandev: its ndash
15:13  Maxdamantus: I know.
15:14  Teratogen: too bad javascript doesn't handle complex numbers
15:14  KucukMubasir: why does my browser send a request for checking the expire date of every resource, when I refresh the page; but not when I re-type the name of the site to address bar and enter?
15:16  Juandev: are there any prohibited characters for strings? which might have been interpret somhow?
15:17  Maxdamantus: js> undefined.foo
15:17  gbot2: Maxdamantus: Error: TypeError: undefined has no properties
15:17  Maxdamantus: js> (42).foo
15:17  gbot2: Maxdamantus: undefined
15:17  _sudo: I think our argument rests on our definitions of weak typing.  I think wikipedia describes my position well. "One of the more common definitions states that weakly typed programming languages are those that support either implicit type conversion (nearly all languages support at least one implicit type conversion), ad-hoc polymorphism (also known as overloading) or both"
15:18  Maxdamantus: No, because the reaction * has to strings that look like numbers is to do with duck typing.
15:18  Maxdamantus: The fact that it's possible may have something to do with weak typing.
15:18  stride: *yawn* someone is wrong on the internet
15:18  dew: KucukMubasir: cos that's what refreshing a page does..
15:18  Maxdamantus: Though I think more to do with dynamic typing.
15:19  KucukMubasir: dew, why is it different than the event when I type the address of the site to address bar?
15:19  _sudo: implicit type conversion is weak typing. "42" * 4 is doing an implicit type conversion.  I Would call that a perfect example of weak typing.
15:19  Maxdamantus: Since it does call ToNumber, as defined in the standard.
15:19  Maxdamantus: How is it implicit?
15:19  dew: it just is, refreshing the page sends fresh requests for all the resources. It's never been the same thing as clicking a link to the page
15:20  _sudo: you dont have to say parseInt("42") * 4
15:20  Maxdamantus: parseInt("42")*4 would be somewhat implicit imo
15:20  Maxdamantus: Oh, sorry.
15:20  _sudo: the conversion is implied
15:20  Maxdamantus: explicit
15:20  Maxdamantus: The conversion is done by the * operator though.
15:20  Maxdamantus: And it's not really a conversion
15:21  Maxdamantus: It applies the internal ToNumber function to both inputs.
15:21  yonk: Hi people, i'm searching a javascript optimizer from barcelona to work about 30 days as a freelance in the office. Interesteds please query me. Inmediate incorporation. Thank you!
15:21  _sudo: Regardless of how it is done, the conversion is implied.  The definition for weak typing revolves around implicit conversion.
15:21  Maxdamantus: Which does lots of magic to make something that has type "number"
15:21  Maxdamantus: That magic might have to do with duck typing
15:22  stride: you have a string literal that is converted and used as integer internally, how is that not an implicit conversion?
15:22  Maxdamantus: eg, if it finds a string that looks like a number.
15:22  Maxdamantus: You can't just "convert" values in JS.
15:22  Maxdamantus: It's done via an operator, because they cause some internal function to be performed, or by a method, like toString
15:23  stride: so? the conversion takes place in the interpreter, that's why it's implicit

15:28  aidan_: I want to load about 800 tiny images into the dom. I want to do this with a loading screen (e.g. showing each new image as it is loaded on top of the previous one)
15:28  aidan_: Anyone have any ideas?
15:30  bradleymeck: use img.onload
15:32  tuxnani: i have this kind of regular expressions : http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/phone_numbers.html
15:32  tuxnani: please someone help me out
15:32  tuxnani: (\d{3})\D*(\d{3})\D*(\d{4})\D*(\d*)$, does this reg exp work?
15:32  aidan_: bradleymeck: so I write <img src=foo onload="..."> into the dom, that would work?
15:32  marcot: l4rk: Is there any?  Do you have some link that explain the details?
15:32  bradleymeck: take it to #regex,but on glance yes
15:32  l4rk: marcot: the only difference is that you can do "'" and '"'
15:33  KucukMubasir: thanks dew; I didn't know that.
15:33  marcot: l4rk: Ok, thanks.  That's what I thought.
15:33  bradleymeck: aidan_ you could do it in the dom, but i would think taking it out into a generic loader script would be more apt for reuse
15:36  _sudo: 800 tiny images?
15:37  _sudo: loading those individually would take alot of connections
15:37  _sudo: just load it as a sprite as one image

15:49  ablomen: remove the quotes
15:49  quantum: ablomen, okay, thanks
15:49  _sudo: not to menntion appenChild is not a method

15:51  quantum: _sudo: Do you know the solution?
15:51  quantum: or just flooding?
15:52  _sudo: lol if you want to call that flooding I am simply saying state your problem.  How can a person debug your code if you don't say WHY it doesn't work or WHAT it is supposed to do.
15:53  quantum: _sudo: allright
15:54  quantum: _sudo: Please if you know an solution to problem, help, otherwise please stop advicing
15:55  l4rk: quantum: learn to ask questions
15:55  aidan_: _sudo: external source
15:56  aidan_: bradleymeck: .. how do I catch the onload for something not in the dom?
15:56  quantum: l4rk: sorry?
15:56  _sudo: as a matter of fact I do know your solution quantum.  I just want you to ask properly
15:56  _sudo: ablomen basically spelled your problem out for you
15:56  aidan_: I want to load about 800 tiny images into the dom. I want to do this with a loading screen (e.g. showing each new image as it is loaded on top of the previous one). Anyone have any ideas?
15:56  l4rk: oh now you're just being a douche _sudo

15:57  quantum: _sudo: Well I posted the link
15:57  EvanR-work: stop flooding, all of you
15:57  l4rk: w
15:57  l4rk: h
15:57  l4rk: y
15:58  _sudo: Well he told me to "stop advicing".  Im not being a macho ircer.  He just expects people to cater to him and tell them what to do.
15:58  l4rk: yeah that's annoying
15:59  l4rk: i hate when i'm told to stop advicing
15:59  l4rk: w/e that means
15:59  quantum: l4rk: sorry?
15:59  quantum: l4rk: I was talking to _sudo
15:59  l4rk: quantum: then why'd you pm me?
15:59  yak[work]: aidan_: honestly you should have one sprite and not six million tiny images. but if you insist, make an array of all the links, init a counter at 0, pick the first link, create the Image object, register the onLoad callback for it and assign it that link. Inside the callback, increment the counter and do basically the same - create a new image object, give it the onLoad, assign it the next link
16:00  EvanR-work: this is like three stooges
16:00  _sudo: The issues are "appenChild" and and where you are calling appendChild you are using apostrophes when you shouldnt be.
16:00  l4rk: which one are u
16:00  quantum: l4rk: allright, thank you
16:00  EvanR-work: shemp
16:01  _sudo: but I think it is a reasonable expectation for someone to state their problem rather than say "It doesn't work"
16:02  quantum: _sudo: I tried that code, I just asked what's wrong
16:02  quantum: please see my first text
16:02  quantum: you can see
16:03  quantum: please tell me when I wrote why it doesn't work?
16:04  yak[work]: quantum: That is too broad of a question that provides us with no facts to work with at all. The only answer you can usually expect from asking "what's wrong" is "Let me guess, it doesn't work". What you should be doing is telling us what's wrong yourself - because, you know, you've just ran that code and it didn't to what yo uexpected - and asking us how to fix it.
16:05  _sudo: You have three problems with that code.  I stated them 5 minutes ago.
16:05  _sudo: If it doesn not work beyond that you need to specify why
16:05  quantum: quotes? I have already removed
16:05  _sudo: did you fix appenChild?
16:06  quantum: appendChild?
16:06  quantum: okay okay
16:06  quantum: saw
16:06  quantum: d missed
16:06  l4rk: ...
16:07  yak[work]: And that's why reading everything in a response to your question is important.
16:07  quantum: yak[work], right
16:11  quantum: to create a text node we have to use double quotes?
16:13  Teratogen: too bad javascript doesn't handle complex numbers
16:16  EvanR-work: like many other expressive data structures that js cant handle, you can encode them into arrays and objects
16:17  Guest47442: Where could i find a recursive function that extracts all combinaison (couple, triplet, n-uplet) of an array of string ? many thanks for helping.
16:17  EvanR-work: you mean without duplicates
16:17  Guest47442: yes
16:17  aidan_: yak[work]: it's from an external source
16:17  Guest47442: or i'll modify it to ignore duplicates
16:17  EvanR-work: you cant logically have duplicates
16:18  aidan_: yak[work]: will look at this Image object idea, thanks
16:18  EvanR-work: since its not defined what the biggest ntuplet would be
16:18  EvanR-work: Guest47442: so without duplicates the biggest one would be the same size as the array
16:18  Guest47442: in my case the biggest ntuplet would be 4
16:19  iDope: Hello, I am very new to Javascript and I would like to have a few conceptual questions answered. First off, Is it possible for a script loaded at abc.com to do a web request to xyz.com and display the results in the abc.com page? Secondly can these results be actually sent to abc.com?
16:19  EvanR-work: er... just 4 because 4 or is that the size of the input array
16:19  _sudo: aidan_: Why are you loading 800 images from another site?  Do they change?  You could download them yourself and make them a sprite if you don't have access to the images.
16:19  Guest47442: size of array would be 5
16:19  _sudo: and load the sprite from your server
16:19  EvanR-work: so in general you want the biggest to be n-1 where n is the size of the input?
16:19  _sudo: (probably copyright infringement though) ;)
16:20  Guest47442: right
16:20  aidan_: _sudo: yes they change, are load distirbuted on different servers, etc. I know what spriting is, doesn't apply here :)
16:20  EvanR-work: ok so take this task in pieces and solve the n-1 case, the n-2 case, etc until you get to 1 which is just the original array
16:20  mytoz_: iDope: only with JSONP or using something serverside to fetch those things
16:20  mytoz_: iDope: maybe there's something in HTML 5, but I wouldn't lean on it if there is
16:21  Guest47442: im looking for a function that reveive an array of strings and returns all the combinaison of doubles, triplets, quadruplet.
16:21  EvanR-work: that is very specific
16:21  EvanR-work: you need to write it yourself, and im trying to help you
16:21  iDope: mytoz_ so the answer to the first question at least is yes.
16:22  _sudo: aidan_: alright, just wanted to make sure you thought out your options before creating that many connections
16:22  aidan_: thanks :)
16:22  Guest47442: i wrote a function that returns all couples for an any sized array
16:22  EvanR-work: that is, the cartesian product
16:22  Guest47442: but i'm pretty sure there is a way to make it recurive so it returns triplets and quadruplets too.
16:23 --- fahadysf is now known as iDope
16:23  Guest47442: right cartesian product, that is where i get lost.
16:23  EvanR-work: Guest47442: first drop the requirement that its only 2 3 and 4, then drop the requirement of array of strings, its array of anything really
16:23  EvanR-work: and you want all ntuples
16:24  EvanR-work: once you solve that, you can just do that for n-1 n-2 n-3... 1
16:25  EvanR-work: so concentrating on give all ntuple combinations of an array
16:25  EvanR-work: the function is
16:27  EvanR-work: function(n, a, accum){
16:27  EvanR-work: n will decrease on each recursive call until its 0, in which case accum is the answer
16:27  EvanR-work: a is the original array
16:28  EvanR-work: where you will take choices
16:28  Guest47442: interesting
16:29  EvanR-work: when n is not zero, you must replicate each entry in accum, append each choice in a, then pass accum recursively with n-1
16:29  Guest47442: i have a full trace of what it should do on a paper, but can't make a pattern that works everytime
16:29  EvanR-work: to start the recursive pass the appropriate n, and accum starts as a
16:29  EvanR-work: recursion*
16:32  Guest47442: so accum is initialized with the a if it exist
16:32  EvanR-work: if it exists?
16:32  Guest47442: a is where my data are, right ?
16:32  EvanR-work: yeah, why would it not exist
16:32  Guest47442: then if not empty
16:33  EvanR-work: the algorithm should work on an empty input
16:33  Guest47442: i initialize the accum
16:33  EvanR-work: the answer will be empty
16:33  Guest47442: ok
16:33  EvanR-work: without having to check
16:33  Guest47442: should i split in some way the a to make recursion on it, that is where i get confused
16:34  EvanR-work: no the a is static for a given evaluation
16:34  gkatsev: woot, recursion and accumulators.
16:34  gkatsev: I wish js had tail-call optimization
16:35  EvanR-work: well a given implementation of js might have that
16:36  gkatsev: well, none have it currently.
16:36  Maggi: hello
16:36  gkatsev: They should just write it into the spec
16:36  EvanR-work: because that magically makes it appear in implementations xD
16:36  EvanR-work: its like js prototype
16:37  gkatsev: EvanR-work: no, it doesnt but it means that it is more likely to get implemented by everyone. Firefox, for example, has yield and lets but no one else has them, and let would be really useful. If let was in the spec, it would be much more likely to migrate to other implementations, no?
16:38  EvanR-work: doesnt work with css!
16:38  EvanR-work: "what is a standard really"
16:38  gkatsev: Ecmascript, lol
16:39  EvanR-work: no i mean what makes a standard a standard
16:39  EvanR-work: in general
16:39  gkatsev: ah
16:40  gkatsev: having some guy declare it a standard. Like crockford did for json?
16:40  bradleymeck: 1. Documentation 2. Community 3. Aggressive behavior towards others?
16:40  EvanR-work: lol
16:41  Guest47442: EvanR-work, so if my size is n=4 i would call the function for n-1(triplet), the for n-2(couple)
16:41  Sorella: 4. Waiting for Microsoft to implement the opposite thing.
16:42  EvanR-work: Guest47442: yes, use it for each ntuple family you want
16:42  gkatsev: Sorella: no, it should be 4. MS rewriting it in .Net with a weird name loosely based on the original.
16:42  gkatsev: s/rewriting/implementing/
16:43  bradleymeck: ah .net, how large can a library become
16:43  Guest47442: so i take each couple and the try all combinaison adding in more 'string' and collect every triplet it makes
16:43  EvanR-work: so big it needs its own runtime environment and text editor
16:44  gkatsev: IDE
16:44  _sudo: I actually read something along the lines of w3c saying ie9 will be most compliant browser
16:44  EvanR-work: Guest47442: string has nothing to do with it
16:44  Guest47442: just an example
16:44  Guest47442: i understand i have to make abstraction of the type
16:44  bradleymeck: _sudo in raw html right now yes, in other aspects no
16:45  EvanR-work: in your accumulator you may have all pairs, so to get all triples you copy each pair N times and append each element of a
16:45  gkatsev: _sudo: it has to do with their html5 test that they released. It actually is only a small fraction of html5 and while IE9 does come on top in that test it really doesn't mean anything.
16:45  EvanR-work: an exponential process
16:46  gkatsev: in fact, they updated their test page with a red box saying the tests are incomplete and can change everyday and it doesn't really mean anything until they finalize their 20000 tests.
16:46  _sudo: yeah I know there were some issues with it.  I just wanted to throw that out there :P
16:47  gkatsev: well, the w3c did not say that ie9 is most compliant.
16:47  Guest47442: thank you evanr-work, very helpful, i'll concentrate on my paper and find the answer, i feel it coming lol
16:47  gkatsev: functionalProgramming++
16:47  jsBot: gkatsev gave a beer to functionalProgramming. functionalProgramming now has 1 beer.
16:48  _sudo: well I was digging it out of my memory and slipped a bit I guess.  I said it more for the reaction than for any factual value.
16:48  gkatsev: :P
16:49  yak[work]: http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2010/11/02/html5
16:50  Sorella: has Microsoft added actual css transform support to ie9 yet?
16:50  Sorella: last time I tried it they had only built the parser, so it was a noop
16:51  Maggi: IE is the only browser I know of that has support for Ruby Annotation :p
16:51  gkatsev: Sorella: no
16:51  _sudo: ie has had matrix transforms since ie5! taske that!
16:51  _sudo: they may not be readable in the least bit, but you can angle text!
16:52  Sorella: IE's matrixes are wierd
16:52  _sudo: horrible actually
16:52  _sudo: lol
16:52  _sudo: but no other broser could do transforms till recently ;)
16:54  _sudo: I am just giving you guys a hard time.  I hate IE too.
16:54  _sudo: I am very happy that ie9 supports border-radius though
16:54  gkatsev: I am happy that IE9 doesn't suck anymore.
16:54  _sudo: they so copied chrome
16:55  gkatsev: how so?
16:55  _sudo: minimalist ui
16:55  gkatsev: ah, I guess.
16:55  Sorella: all browsers now have minimalist ui
16:55  gkatsev: They were kind of going there with IE8 but yeah.
16:55  Sorella: even furryfox
16:55  EvanR-work: both copied my fltk2 custom browser
16:55  EvanR-work: on that aspect
16:55  gkatsev: http://www.myextralife.com/comic/literal/
16:55  EvanR-work: i hate gui
16:55  _sudo: use lynx
16:55  gkatsev: EvanR-work: lynx? w3m?
16:55  Sorella: lynx is pretty cool :3
16:56  _sudo: I prefer terminal.  I am in my terminal right now
16:56  gkatsev: lynx doesn't support rtl text :/
16:56  _sudo: I chat with irssi
16:56  gkatsev: irssi ftw
16:56  _sudo: its great
16:56  gkatsev: I have irssi inside of screen on a server
16:57  _sudo: I love terminal apps
16:57  _sudo: do all my svn command line
16:57  gkatsev: my uptime now is almost 92 days
16:57  Sorella: lynx -dump
16:57  gkatsev: _sudo: finch?
16:57  Sorella: svn eh?
16:57  EvanR-work: gkatsev: they dont have graphics
16:57  _sudo: gkatsev: european swallow?
16:58  gkatsev: EvanR-work: w3m has images
16:58  _sudo: gkatsev: What is finch?
16:58  gkatsev: _sudo: finch is the terminal gui implementation of pidgin using the libpurple lib
16:59  _sudo: gkatsev: I will have to look into that.  That is pretty sweet
16:59  _sudo: I have been using kopete
16:59  gkatsev: the other one is pork (which a friend of mine works on) which is an irssi-type implementation of an IM client.
16:59  gkatsev: I prefer finch though
16:59  EvanR-work: _sudo: kopete randomly deleted my buddy list once...
16:59  gkatsev: lol
17:00  _sudo: lol
17:00  gkatsev: never used kopete
17:00 * Sorella neither
17:00  _sudo: I love the meta contacts though
17:00  gkatsev: also, I stopped liking KDE once I stopped using knoppix
17:00  EvanR-work: uh huh
17:00  gkatsev: meta contacts?
17:00  Sorella: gkatsev: what do you use now?
17:00  EvanR-work: you always have a degree of uncertainty that the guy writing your programs knew what he was doing, sometimes you have concrete evidence he didnt
17:00  _sudo: I can combine skype / yahoo / aim accounts under one name
17:00  gkatsev: gmail chat/pidgin
17:01  gkatsev: I may return back to finch now
17:01  gkatsev: idk
17:01 --- _Blorb is now known as Blorb
17:01  Sorella: oh, I meant desktop manager
17:01  gkatsev: ah, windows :/
17:01  _sudo: I was doing all my programming in VIM until I found komodo
17:01  Sorella: whoa
17:01  gkatsev: I do all my programming in komodo
17:01  Sorella: I feel bad for you .-.
17:01  _sudo: vim is great
17:02  _sudo: but komodo works very well for my needs
17:02  gkatsev: Sorella: well, windows 7 is actually not that bad. I also have an ubuntu VM running.
17:02  gkatsev: Sorella: the reason I am using win7 is because I like to game every so often and also because linux does not support my monitor layout AND compositing at the same time.
17:02  gkatsev: (23" in landscape and 24" in portrait)
17:03  Sorella: hm, I only play on my console, and boot windows when I want to play eroges
17:03  Sorella: but programming on windows is just too painful
17:04  _sudo: I prefer to do my composting separately.  I don't like vegatibles decomposing on my monitor.
17:04  gkatsev: Sorella: I dont have any consoles. Never have, actually.
17:04  gkatsev: _sudo: ...
17:05  EvanR-work: gkatsev: you could probably get it to work with the right combination of magic xorg.conf words not advertised by nvidia
17:05  NoiseEee: i just picked up my first console, a ps3
17:05  NoiseEee: mostly because its just a crazy awesome network device
17:05  EvanR-work: and ubuntu failed to pick those words
17:05  EvanR-work: i dont blame them
17:05  gkatsev: Sorella: I dont program in windows, I program in ubuntu. Before my VM, I ran portable ubuntu. But it doesn't like node.js, so I switched to VM. Which I can now ssh to from anywhere in the world due to dyndns
17:06  gkatsev: EvanR-work: I tried and it kind of works but it is still messy.
17:06  EvanR-work: i find you can get it perfect
17:06  EvanR-work: just nvidia are idiots
17:06  gkatsev: also, win7 actually works well with dual monitors because it has the aero snap feature which gives you commands for moving windows between monitors with a keyboard shortcut.
17:07  gkatsev: EvanR-work: ati drivers are worse.
17:07  EvanR-work: i have no doubt
17:07  EvanR-work: when your graphics are in the handles of two mega cathedral operations, you have no choice but to worship at one of them
17:07  EvanR-work: in the hands*
17:08  EvanR-work: we need open graphics
17:09  gkatsev: the reason why I currently have an nvidia graphics card: I got an ATI 5770, a nice low end high powered graphics card that supports dx11. It was dropped from their ubuntu drivers when I got it. On windows, whenever I tried to change monitor resolution, i.e. launching a game with a different default resolution, it crashed my machine. The next driver release was the following month. Possible it would not be fixed. Unlikely it would be re-added to 
17:09  big_ham: hey ... I have a DisplayBanner js on my company's site as a banner randomizer. Trying to add <a> link with rel=lightbox and while the <a> link works, the rel tag isn't working. Why would that be?
17:10  EvanR-work: gkatsev: your crap client truncated your message and didnt tell you
17:10  _sudo: I have two dual 25s on kubuntu and it works great
17:10  gkatsev: EvanR-work: irssi....
17:10  gkatsev: EvanR-work: where did it get cut off?
17:10  EvanR-work: our crap client
17:11  EvanR-work: of the future
17:11  _sudo: lol
17:11  EvanR-work: gkatsev: unlikely it would be re-added to
17:11  _sudo: don't be dissin irssi
17:11  gkatsev:  to linux drivers. Returned it and got nvidia geforce 275
17:11  EvanR-work: maybe you have to set freenodes limit in some config
17:11  Sorella: gkatsev: I see. You should get a console tho, most awesome games are console-only.
17:12  gkatsev: Sorella: I HATE playing FPS on console. Also, I dont have the money.
17:12  _sudo: farmville is not console only!
17:12 * gkatsev is a college student
17:12  gkatsev: I am already paying for my own cellphone and stuff.
17:12 * Sorella doesn't like FPSs
17:13  gkatsev: FPSs are fun. Assuming you have a keyboard and mouse.
17:13  EvanR-work: farmville is an fps now?
17:13  gkatsev: haha
17:13 * gkatsev stays away from farmville like the plague.
17:13  _sudo: In some countries.
17:13  NoiseEee: i kinda stick to sports and car racing
17:13  gkatsev: s/the plague/zombies/
17:14  gkatsev: RPGs are fun.
17:14  _sudo: nerd.
17:14  _sudo: :P
17:14 * Sorella only plays jRPGs, eroges and survival horrors
17:14  gkatsev: games like assassin's creed and prince of persia are fun
17:14  EvanR-work: resident evil was awesome
17:14  _sudo: console based rpgs!
17:14  _sudo: as in terminal based!
17:14  gkatsev: yes, RE is great
17:14  NoiseEee: i just don't have the time for many games :(
17:14  gkatsev: _sudo: zork?
17:14  NoiseEee: games that don't involve a 3 year old anyhow
17:14  Sorella: _sudo: IFs?
17:15  EvanR-work: you, jill, the master of unlocking, ...
17:15  Sorella: I didn't like much RE. Now Fatal Frame, that was awesome.
17:15  _sudo: lol I actually dont play games
17:15  Sorella: RE was too much about shooting zombies omg
17:15  gkatsev: in COD Black Ops, you can play zork in the game console. There is even an achievement for that
17:15  _sudo: but if I did..... they would be in terminal...
17:15  EvanR-work: zork isnt strictly an 'RPG' since you dont level up ;)
17:15  gkatsev: lol
17:15  EvanR-work: like zelda
17:15  gkatsev: fine, nethack?
17:16  Sorella: zork is interactive fiction, actually
17:16  _sudo: are there any mmorpg terminal based games
17:16  big_ham: hey ... I have a DisplayBanner js on my company's site as a banner randomizer. Trying to add <a> link with rel=lightbox and while the <a> link works, the rel tag isn't working. Why would that be?
17:16  _sudo: that would be cool
17:16  EvanR-work: _sudo: haha.
17:16  Sorella: _sudo: IRC?
17:16  EvanR-work: MUD MUSH MUCK MOO
17:16  EvanR-work: etc
17:16  EvanR-work: i.e. the inspiration for everquest
17:16 * _sudo strikes sorella for 50 damage
17:17  gkatsev: I've played d&d in IRC for a bit, actually.
17:17 * Sorella dies
17:17  EvanR-work: _sudo: exactly
17:17  gkatsev: we had a dice bot and everything
17:17  gkatsev: Sorella: _sudo has to roll first.

17:18  _sudo: gkatsev: who do you think you are? the game master???
17:18  Sorella: big_ham: I don't follow. What exactly isn't working?
17:18  gkatsev: _sudo: yes.

17:18  big_ham: Sorella, the lightbox (it's actually shadowbox) tag

17:20  gkatsev: Sorella: yeah, REP. would be cool if it was a REPL per IRC user, though.
17:20  Sorella: well, PMs work like REPL :3
17:21  Sorella: tho, it isn't public
17:21  gkatsev: oh, they do?
17:21  big_ham: Sorella: I only changed one link inside the js to try and launch the shadowbox, thus the difference between the 4 images

17:23  iaj: lo there - anyone got a example of how I can uncheck radiobuttons via javascript?
17:23  aidan_: How can I check if a key exists in an array?
17:23  gkatsev: aidan_: you mean a value?
17:23  aidan_: no, a key
17:23  Sorella: aidan_: "key" in object
17:23  aidan_: if (foo[1])
17:24  Sorella: v8> o = {"foo": "bar"}; ["foo" in o, "bar" in o]
17:24  v8bot: Sorella: [true, false]
17:24  gkatsev: that would return the value that foo has stored in 1
17:24  repxl: hello
17:24  repxl: can someone give me a js loader ? example first will load content then it wait 2 secounds then it load navigation ... ?
17:24  coder7of9: i am submitting the content of an html textarea via a post to a java server. when teh server gets it all the new lines are gone. how tio i persist the new lines?
17:24  Sorella: also, that would return false if the value was falsy. Like "", undefined, 0, null
17:25  gkatsev: repxl: make one. Not hard.

17:26  gkatsev: in an array, easiest way is (arr.length>key)
17:26  aidan_: ah
17:26  Sorella: quantum: no, it's a property of the global object.
17:26  Sorella: and a function.
17:27  gkatsev: aidan_: whether the value of arr[key] is undefined or not is another matter.

17:38  repxl: hmm how make timeout on a div tag. that it show after 2 secounds
17:39  Maggi: `js ref setTimeout @ repxl
17:39  Sorella: repxl: div tags have no concept of ``timeout". You want to create a timer that shows a div after too seconds, and someone linked you to window.setTimeout before.
17:39  Sorella: two, even
17:39  Maggi: ..
17:39  Sorella: `ref js setTimeout @ repxl
17:39  v8bot: repxl: window.setTimeout - MDC - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
17:40  repxl: Sorella i see it  but i really dont know how use it
17:40  Sorella: it's inverted, for some weird reason
17:40  repxl: please can you no fast show me  and fast emxaple in pastebin idk exmaple make div tag appear after 1 sec plz
17:40  Sorella: setTimeout( callback-function, miliseconds-to-wait ) -> unique_id_for_this_timer
17:40  riven: repxl: yeah, too bad they didn't include any examples on that page
17:40  riven: OH WAIT
17:40  NoiseEee: repxl: yeah, we can do work for you for free of course.  and what riven said
17:41  Maggi: repxl: 50 USD
17:41  repxl: come on it,s not hard you said . plz its fast for you you know
17:41  Maggi: ;p

17:42  carlocci: Sorella, ref js makes more sense to me, but I think originally it was because it conflicted with jsbot's syntax

17:45  todd: disregard.. my screen was scrolled up like 2 days
17:46  repxl: who will be so good and can show me a little example for free ? :/ come on where are the old good times. ?
17:46  EvanR-work: sometimes you get people willing to pay for answers
17:46  Sorella: repxl: we have showed you so many examples already, sweetie
17:47  EvanR-work: this guy is offering you to do it for free
17:47  EvanR-work: hah
17:47  Maggi: NoiseEee: you can connect a PS 3 to media servers and stream stuff
17:47  repxl: Sorella i see the example but its using text messages like i press on someting and it appear and there are many idk what use
17:47  todd: There is also a ps3 media server app written in Java that works pretty well.
17:47  Sorella: repxl: you're really better off asking here: http://dis.4chan.org/prog/
17:47  Sorella: these guys are great with examples :3
17:48  todd: I would recommend hard wiring for HD content though.
17:48  NoiseEee: Maggi: yeah that's pretty much why I got it... all my recorded TV shows, movies, stuff I D/L, youtube, etc...
17:48  NoiseEee: todd: yeah i do that for the most part, on HD that isn't xvid
17:48  todd: I have yet to watch a bluray. I'm such a slacker.

17:52  armence: Hello all
17:52  gkatsev: oh, didn't think `ref mdc would work, nice.
17:52  armence: Is there a way to do unit testing is javascript?
17:53 @Phrogz: armence: There is no unit testing built into the language, but quite a few unit testing libraries exist. So yes.
17:53  _sudo: I cant stay away from this place
17:53  _sudo: its a drug
17:53 @Phrogz: _sudo: IRC in general is bad for you.
17:53 @Phrogz: (And me.)
17:53  Maggi: `g javascript unit testing @ armence
17:53  gbot2: armence: JsUnit - http://www.jsunit.net/
17:53  _sudo: I spent most of the morning on here
17:53  _sudo: and now I am back
17:53  armence: Phrogz, What would be one which is generally accepted to be "good" and to also well known and documented?
17:53  Sorella: repxl: setTimeout(get div("id") -> show(), 2e3)
17:53  bradleymeck: jasmine, jsunit, if you are running them in node or some repl there are more
17:54  gkatsev: there is also qunit, right?
17:54  gkatsev: there is a plethora of javascript unit testing frameworks
17:54  repxl: http://pastebin.com/QJ9EqYQh
17:54  buubot: repxl:  The 36 line paste QJ9EqYQh has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/870  .
17:55  armence: Maggi, Thanks. More specifically, I'm not really looking to test "browser" code but more the stuff underneath the browser code. Is JsUnit still the thing to do?
17:55 @Phrogz: armence: I don't happen to use one, so I don't know. I think a bit of googling here will serve you well (unless someone else can comment on unit testing libraries).
17:55  Sorella: `eloquent @ repxl
17:55  jsBot: repxl: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
17:56 @Phrogz: repxl: You seem to be making progress. What's your question now?
17:56  Sorella: armence: there's Jasmine. It's pretty good.
17:56  armence: Sorella, I'll look into it. Thanks
17:56  Maggi: armence: no idea, it was just the first entry from google
17:57  Maggi: armence: never had the need to unit test JS
17:57 * Phrogz isn't a big fan of BDD; smells too much like AppleScript 'syntax'.
17:57  jimi_: How can I make a href links in an ifame open in the parent window, and not the iframe? using like target=_parent?
17:57 @Phrogz: I personally like simple assertions.
17:57  repxl: Phrogz click on my pastebin edit it and share it it,s my question . ty
17:58  repxl: just show me how and i will know it.
17:58  repxl: becuase my example set no timeout
17:58 @Phrogz: repxl: That isn't a question. What are you trying to do, and what isn't working?
17:59 * Sorella haven't AppleScript. But, yeah, the syntax of Jasmine is a bit too much. I'd love if javascript'd have some delicious `assert` operators :3
17:59  gkatsev: Sorella: you accidentally the whole word.
17:59  repxl: Phrogz im trying to make that div id="header" will show after 2 secounds .
17:59  gkatsev: Sorella: node.js has an assert module.
17:59  Sorella: I always accidentally something :3
18:00  bradleymeck: sorella whats so bad about assert as a function
18:00  Sorella: oh, cool. I haven't checked node.js yet.
18:00  Sorella: bradleymeck: it's not an operator :3
18:01  Twey: Urgh
18:01  bradleymeck: obv operators are superior *mumbling laugh*
18:01  gkatsev: Sorella: you should. It is great. You dont actually even need to use it for server programming. You can just write scripts in it and stuff. It has unix socket support and file IO support and a bunch of cool stuff.
18:01  Twey: Yeah, 'cause *more* magic second-class citizens is just what JS needs >.>
18:02  bradleymeck: if someone finished a java integration layer for it, you could merge rhino code and it, which would be nice
18:02  repxl: Phrogz you,r here ? will you help me ?
18:03  armence: It looks like both jsUnit and Jasmine require one to use a web browser... Aren't there some javascript unit testing frameworks that would instead use a standalone engine?
18:03  Sorella: gkatsev: I've upgraded it to a build from source yesterday and plan to use it on a personal project, alongside with APE.
18:03  Sorella: armence: Jasmine isn't tied to the browser. You can even test it from inside a ruby app if you want.
18:04  Sorella: not that I'm into slow as fuck ruby
18:04  bradleymeck: vows, expresso run in node.js, not exactly the same, im sure someone has something for rhino and env.js but dont know it
18:04  Sorella: armence: you mean a stand-alone program that doesn't requires a JS interpreter?
18:04  armence: Sorella, Thanks...
18:05  armence: Sorella, Well, I mean a JS Interpreter is of course necessary... I mean, how else could you run javascript code?
18:05  Sorella: I meant an external JS interpreter :3
18:06  Sorella: but I don't see the point in that. You can just make a bash/python/whatever script and ./tests on the command line
18:06 @Phrogz: repxl: Step 1) Make it hidden. Step 2) Kick off a setTimeout. Step 3) In that timeout, find the div. Step 4) In that timeout, once you have found the div, make it visible.
18:07 @Phrogz: repxl: Which of those steps do you have trouble with?
18:07  armence: Sorella, Well, really what I meant is: not using a browser so I don't have to be running this in a gui environment and it can be done unattended...
18:08  iaj: hmm.. how do I check an radiobutton whether its checked or not?
18:09  repxl: Phrogz :( all of them i just understand the text but im not able to write it in js :( im rly new to js im just need this set timeout system i will know it then i no need more from js just this . please you dont have some time to write it in my pastebin ? :( i will be so happy really . i know you will not make it but it will be nice if yes :/
18:09 @Phrogz: iaj: Step 1) Find the radio button. Step 2) Ask for its .checked property.
18:10 @Phrogz: repxl: To make something hidden, set its CSS 'display' property to 'none'. You can do this either via JS (myObject.style.display='none') or via stylesheet (#mydivid { display:none }).
18:10  iaj: Phrogz: thanks.. so it works exactly the same as a checkbox field?
18:10 @Phrogz: iaj: Yes; but note that you will have more than one radio button with the same name attribute.
18:11 @Phrogz: repxl: To use setTimeout, you can     function foo(){ ... };    setTimeout( foo, 2000 ) // 2 seconds later.
18:11 @Phrogz: repxl: To find an object, as I linked to you, give it an id attribute and then use   var mydiv = document.getElementById('jim');
18:11  aidan_: How can I get the HTML out of an Image() object?
18:12 @Phrogz: aidan_: What is the HTML in an Image() object?
18:12 @Phrogz: repxl: To make the div visible again, set its CSS display property to 'block'.
18:12  aidan_: I need something like "<li>" + Image() + "</li>"
18:12 @Phrogz: aidan_: <li><img src="..."></li>  ?
18:12  aidan_: Phrogz: but I've got a var im = Image()
18:13  ylluminate: Phrogz, you're cool.  always have been a phan :)
18:13 @Phrogz: aidan_: a) why? b) so? :)
18:14  aidan_: Phrogz: so I make the HTML myself?
18:14 @Phrogz: aidan_: If you're using JS to preload images, then the image will be in the browser's cache; creating another image element with the same src will load correctly.
18:14  aidan_: okay
18:14 @Phrogz: aidan_: Well, you could see if the browsers you care to support happen to implement .outerHTML
18:15 @Phrogz: And thus "<li>"+im.outerHTML+"</li>";
18:21  repxl: loook http://pastebin.com/NMB4R5hw    what im missing it no work but i really dont know what im missing
18:21  buubot: repxl:  The 29 line paste NMB4R5hw has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/871  .
18:23 @Phrogz: repxl: What do you meay by "no work"? Do you have your JavaScript console open? Do you see errors?
18:23  EvanR-work: hes unemployed
18:23 @Phrogz: lol
18:23 @Phrogz: repxl: It looks like what you're missing is anything to actually invoke your functions.
18:24 @Phrogz: You've said "When I ask you to showMagicDiv, this is what you should do" but you never actually say "GO! Do it!"
18:24  kkaefer: is there a way to use the new operator with variable arguments (like Function.prototype.call/apply)?
18:24  repxl: Phrogz hmm so where and how write go do it ?
18:24 @Phrogz: repxl: When do you want it to happen? When the user presses a button?
18:25  repxl: Phrogz when the page load
18:25  repxl: at the beggin
18:25 @Phrogz: repxl: Then for simplicity, use CSS to hide your div, not JS. And then...
18:26 @Phrogz: function showMagicDiv(){ document.getEl....display = 'block' };  setTimeout( showMagicDiv, 2000 ) // Note, no parentheses!
18:27 @Phrogz: kkaefer: I remember looking into this once, but I don't remember the answer.
18:28  kkaefer: you probably could do some trickery like this:
18:28  kkaefer: var obj = {};
18:28  kkaefer: obj.__proto__ = ParentObject.prototype
18:28  repxl: phrogz http://pastebin.com/kWqJYFMH
18:28  buubot: repxl:  The 30 line paste kWqJYFMH has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/872  .
18:28  repxl: no work
18:28  kkaefer: ParentObject.call(obj, ...);
18:31 @Phrogz: js> function Foo(){ for (var i=0;i<arguments.length;++i) this["prop"+i]=arguments[i] }; var f = new Foo; f.constructor.apply( f, [1,2,3] ); f.prop1
18:31  gbot2: Phrogz: 2
18:31 @Phrogz: kkaefer: Let's see if that works with arrays.
18:31 @Phrogz: js> var a = new Array; a.constructor.apply( a, [1,2,3] ); [ a, new Array(1,2,3) ]
18:31  gbot2: Phrogz: [[],[1,2,3]]
18:32 @Phrogz: Nope.
18:32 @Phrogz: kkaefer: Is that good enough for you?
18:32  kkaefer: why would I want to use that with the array object?
18:32  iateadonut: what ctrl-keys are not used as hotkeys in both explorer and firefox
18:33  kkaefer: the problem is that when calling the constructor function without parameters, it may still do something, albeit without any values
18:33 @Phrogz: kkaefer: I don't know, but I'm assuming the same problem holds for other intrinsics. But if you just want to do it yourself...
18:33  Sorella: kkaefer: I did a function that creates a bare object and calls the constructor in it.
18:33 @Phrogz: kkaefer: True; if you have control over the constructor, you could ensure that re-calling it overwrites the do-nothing setup.
18:33  Sorella: v8> function Foo(a){ a.do_stuff() }; error = new Foo;
18:33  v8bot: Sorella: TypeError: Cannot call method 'do_stuff' of undefined
18:34  Sorella: kkaefer: https://gist.github.com/663335
18:34  EvanR-work: iateadonut: sounds like dangerous territory
18:35  EvanR-work: but almost any gui endeavour is
18:35 @Phrogz: repxl: You need to think about what you're writing. You have lines at the top of your script that should be deleted.
18:35  EvanR-work: that involves end users
18:35  Sorella: I'm not sure there's another way of doing it tho
18:35 @Phrogz: Further, when I said "note, no parentheses" I meant     setTimeout( showMagicDiv, 2000 )   instead of     setTimeout(  showMagicDiv(), 2000 )
18:36 @Phrogz: kkaefer: This is relevant: http://www.ozoneasylum.com/30593
18:38  kkaefer: https://gist.github.com/672868
18:38  kkaefer: Sorella: ^^
18:39  Sorella: kkaefer: __proto__ is non-standard tho. Does IE implement it?
18:40  kkaefer: I don't care about the client-side
18:40  Sorella: oh
18:40  kkaefer: but yeah, you probably can't use that in a client-side setting
18:40  Sorella: you should use Object.getPrototypeObject then, tho
18:40  kkaefer: why?
18:40  Sorella: if it is implemented
18:41  Sorella: kkaefer: __proto__ is deprecated and non-standard
18:42  repxl: Phrogz so ? what i have to do ?
18:42  kkaefer: deprecated by whom?
18:42  felixjet: should i use window.location.href to redirect user to another page? or its a crappy solution?
18:43  Sorella: kkaefer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto
18:43  Sorella: Object.getPrototypeOf is preferred
18:44  repxl: what is my problem i trying make on load the page that div will load 2 secounds later http://pastebin.com/kWqJYFMH
18:44  buubot: repxl:  The 30 line paste kWqJYFMH has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/873  .
18:44  kkaefer: Sorella: there doesn't seem to be a way to /set/ the __proto__ of an object, though
18:45  Sorella: v8> x = {}; Object.getPrototypeOf(x).z = 3; x.z
18:45  v8bot: Sorella: 3
18:46  Sorella: but yeah, not sure how'd you go with setting it to another object tho
18:48  kkaefer: instanceof would also break
18:48  kkaefer: anyway
18:49  bradleymeck: does .constructor not work right in IE
18:49 @Phrogz: repxl: Delete lines 7-10. Put 'setTimeout' on a new line from line 15. Put parens around your arguments for that timeout. Think for yourself.
18:50 @Phrogz: repxl: And as I told you earlier, use CSS to hide your div initially.
18:51  bradleymeck: Phrogz, getting a little fiesty? Seems .constructor is always the Object function in IE :/
18:52 @Phrogz: bradleymeck: Apparently so (the fiesty). I know nothing about IE and .constructor, but that seems...unlikely.
18:52  bradleymeck: just testing in the console, so idk
18:52  repxl: phr0z
18:52  repxl: like this http://pastebin.com/u6LSxHH2
18:52  buubot: repxl:  The 28 line paste u6LSxHH2 has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/874  .
18:53  repxl: phrogz
18:54 @Phrogz: bradleymeck: javascript:function Foo(){}; var f=new Foo; alert(f.constructor); void(0); // IE
18:55 @Phrogz: repxl: Why would you move the setTimeout call into a different script block? That's not necessary. But you're still not trying to hide the div via a stylesheet.
18:55 @Phrogz: (Unless style.css is doing that for you.)
18:55  Twey: IE doesn't have .constructor AFAIK.  void 0 (void is an operator and as such doesn't require brackets) after an alert is not necessary: alert() already returns undefined.
18:56  Twey: The variable is unnecessary, of course.  I presume there was some reason behind that.
18:56 @Phrogz: repxl: Further, line 10 is clearly wrong. I'm surprised that you didn't realize when I wrote document.getEl....display = 'block'  that I meant "I'm too lazy to write stuff in this .... section in the middle, but clearly you can see that it should be the same as you already have."
18:56  Twey: javascript: alert((new (function() { })).constructor);
18:57  Twey: Hm, maybe IE8 has .constructor?  Does anyone know if we'll ever get .__proto__ there?
18:57  aidan_: can I do new Image().src or something, how can I create a new image and set the source in one pop?
18:57  TomsB: I have flashsocket app. User can connect to server, receive messages, but can't send them (it's sending them, but server never receives). Is this the right IRC where to ask this?
18:58 @Phrogz: Twey: This shows how infrequently I use javascript: syntax; apparently I haven't used it in 10 years or longer, when void(0) was the accepted ending to ensure the page didn't get overwritten :p
18:58 @Phrogz: aidan_: var im; (im=new Image).src='...';
18:58  Twey: Phrogz: Hehe, it's not really necessary; you just need to make sure the expression returns undefined
18:58 @Phrogz: Twey: I had thought so, but put it in for simplicity :)
18:59  Twey: Phrogz: A less noisy way would be to stick ‘void’ *before* the expression.  I guess the trailing void(0) is because people forgot to.
18:59 @Phrogz: (Of my own typing and testing.)
18:59  Twey: aidan_: You'd be best with a helper function
19:00  Twey: `pave
19:00  jsBot: pave: Set a property at arbitrary depth, creating higher properties as necessary: http://js.isite.net.au/snippets/pave
19:00  Twey: aidan_: This one will do it, though that's not its original purpose
19:00 @Phrogz: !!
19:00  Twey: pave(new Image(), "src", "your_source.jpeg")
19:01  Twey: More generally, you'd probably want to use an extend() function to set multiple properties at once
19:01  Twey: `extend
19:01  Twey: Hmph, do we not have a function in the bot for that?
19:01 @Phrogz: for (var i=0,src="foo.jpg bar.jpg".split(' '),len=src.length;i<len;++i){ (new Image).src=src[i] };
19:02 @Phrogz: If you don't need the references. :)
19:02  Twey: Object.extend = function(o1, o2) { for (var x in o2) if (o2.hasOwnProperty(x)) o1[x] = o2[x]; return o1; };
19:03  Twey: *shudder* Bracketless ‘new’ calls
19:04  Twey: Oh, actually
19:04  Twey: IIRC, the argument to new Image() is the source anyway
19:04  aidan_: neat Phrogz
19:04  Twey: So you can do new Image("your_source.jpeg")
19:04 @Phrogz: lol :)
19:04 @Phrogz: Well, maybe not lol, but: "Nice one, Twey."
19:04  aidan_: no nice Twey
19:04  aidan_: er, nice Twey
19:05  aidan_: not sure what the no was.
19:05  Twey: I'm not sure that that works; I'm trying to find some reliable docs on it
19:05  Twey: `js ref Image
19:06  Avi`: why in the world am I getting a parse error on this? http://pastebin.com/SCBXntYB
19:06  buubot: Avi`:  The 13 line paste SCBXntYB has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/875  .
19:06  Twey:     Your search query Image contains characters which need to be escaped. See this FAQ for more information.
19:06  Twey: What?
19:06  NoiseEee: Avi`: uh, line 12?
19:06  aidan_: can I get the name of a function inside the function?
19:06  Avi`: whats wrong with line 12?
19:07  NoiseEee: take another look Avi`
19:07  Avi`: arguments.callee?
19:07  bradleymeck: aidan_ if you have a reference, just use .name
19:07  NoiseEee: Avi`: you didn't paste anything with arguments.callee?
19:07  bradleymeck: dont use callee, please name functions, for stack traces sake
19:08  Avi`: NoiseEee: I was answering aidan_
19:08  Twey: Ah, no, the Web suggests that the arguments are width and height
19:08  Avi`: although I think I just saw it was deprecated ;p
19:08  Avi`: NoiseEee: mother fucker
19:08  eisd: Twey: It's `ref js <search> for MDC or `ref dom <search> for the DOM website. `js ref is jsBot which doesn't actually perform a search
19:08  Avi`: how did JSLint not catch that
19:09  bradleymeck: v8: function foo(){};function bar(){};bar.prototype = new foo();x = new bar();[x,x.__proto__==bar.prototype,x.constructor,bar == foo] // why is x.constructor == foo and not bar?
19:09  v8bot: bradleymeck: [{}, true, function foo(){}, false]
19:09  aidan_: I have var myfunc = function () { ... can I get the name here? ... }
19:09  Avi`: aidan_: why not just say var myFunc = function SomeName() { use.name to get the name} ?
19:09  bradleymeck: var myfunc function myfuncname () { myfuncname.name }
19:10  Avi`: (which is what bradleymeck was asking be done)
19:10  Twey: aidan_: Depending on the intent of your question, use extend() to set various properties on an object without losing the original reference or a loop like Phrogz' to preload a bunch of images (or the forEach method, in newer browsers: "foo.jpg;bar.jpg".split(";").forEach(function(src, o) { o = new Image(); o.src = src; return o; }))
19:10  Twey: eisd: Ah, thanks
19:10  aidan_: Avi`: ".name" gives me the name?
19:10  Avi`: NoiseEee: thanks =/ I'm stupid.
19:10  Twey: `ref js Image
19:10  v8bot: Twey: image - MDC - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/image
19:10  eisd: Twey: np :)
19:10  Twey: Case-insensitive, I see.  Ych.
19:11  eisd: `ref js HTMLImageElement
19:11  v8bot: eisd: HTMLImageElement - MDC - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLImageElement
19:11  Twey: That's not what I'm looking for
19:11  NoiseEee: Avi`: np, sometimes another set of eyes are the key
19:11  eisd: Twey: Ah, I figured you didn't want the XUL search result though
19:11  Twey: I want the Image object constructor
19:11  Twey: Apparently, ‘image’ needs to be escaped in the Mozilla search bar o.@
19:12  repxl: fu ck it
19:12  repxl: !
19:12  Avi`: aidan_: sorry the only answer I know is arguments.callee.name
19:12  Avi`: and bradleymeck frowned at me for suggesting that
19:12  Avi`: so someone else will have to answer
19:12  repxl: my code http://pastebin.com/u6LSxHH2        i have the header div HIDDEN display none and its not working
19:12  buubot: repxl:  The 28 line paste u6LSxHH2 has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/876  .
19:12 * Phrogz goes with .toString() and regex
19:13 @Phrogz: js> (function foo(){}).toString().match( /function (\w+)/ )
19:13  gbot2: Phrogz: ["function foo","foo"]
19:13  NoiseEee: repxl: line 10 there seems like you're missing some text and stuff
19:13  repxl: NoiseEee okey can you write me what add and what remove please ? my nervers going out here. sorry for that
19:13  Avi`: repxl: your showHeader doesn't look like a complete function call
19:14  Avi`: repxl: ...
19:14  Avi`: you kind of already wrote it dude
19:14  Avi`: in line 8
19:14  repxl: Avi can you give me an exmaple please ? im really noob some ppl need more help
19:14 @Phrogz: repxl: Is refusing to think for himself/herself, refusing to learn any JS, and copy/pasting whatever he is told almost directly.
19:14  Avi`: repxl: this is what happens when you copy/paste  code snippets from other people.
19:14  Avi`: repxl: the  code you need is already in the  code you pasted.
19:15  Avi`: so if you wrote it the first time, you can write it the second time. because its the same thing
19:15  repxl: Phrogz i just need this one and im stop with js . just time 1 div lol
19:15  NoiseEee: repxl: do your own work. compare your two functions, figure out what the big differences are
19:15  NoiseEee: repxl: again, you've confused this channel for people that a) do work for free  b) give a crap about your deadlines
19:16  repxl: NoiseEee its 3 lines maximum and its so hard for you to write it ?
19:16  NoiseEee: repxl: how hard is it for YOU to write it?
19:16  Avi`: repxl: 3 lines max, so hard for you to understand it? =)
19:16  repxl: NoiseEee i will not go with js in my life. i want just this . and nothing more
19:16  NoiseEee: repxl: sounds like a plan
19:17  repxl: NoiseEee y i just need the one system and im totaly leaving js becuase im in a other direction .
19:17  NoiseEee: repxl: again, congratulations on your plan
19:18  Gregor: I <3 this channel so much :P
19:18  repxl: NoiseEee i dont know what you mean with plan but really i need help with this
19:18  joeytwiddle: repxl: your hideHeaderDiv function looks good.  but showHeaderDiv looks like you fell asleep on  your Delete key
19:19  repxl: joeytwiddle okey usefull message i see some ppl know how to write to newbies . okey can you say me what is wrong in my showheaderdiv ?
19:19  joeytwiddle: it's not enough like hideHeaderDiv
19:20 @Phrogz: Hint: getElementdisplay is not a valid method of document.
19:21  joeytwiddle: yes.  you need to make your showHeaderDiv function look more like your hideHeaderDiv function
19:21  repxl: ppl this makes me just crazy .
19:21  repxl: hint :
19:21  repxl: i ty for the hint but for me it,s nothing say
19:21  repxl: you know im noob in this methods. and all this names in js .
19:21  joeytwiddle: basically those two functions should be almost identical.  the only difference you want is the "block" or "display" parts
19:22  repxl: hmmmm
19:22 @Phrogz: repxl: Alright, here you go:       <style type="text/css">#yourdivid { display:none }</style><script type="text/javascript">setTimeout( function(){ document.getElementById('yourdivid').style.display = 'block' }, 2000 )</script>
19:22 @Phrogz: repxl: Now go away.
19:23  repxl: Phrogz if its work you will see me never :D  w8
19:23 @Phrogz: If it doesn't work, I will see you never, because I've had enough of your noise in here.
19:24  Sorella: Phrogz: you HELPED him? D:
19:24  NoiseEee: lol
19:24 @Phrogz: Sorella: I helped him semi-patiently for over an hour earlier. At some point it gets to be too much.
19:24  NoiseEee: sometimes you gotta kill a person to get rid of them
19:24  NoiseEee: or something like that
19:24 @Phrogz: Or something like that.
19:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [##javascript +o Phrogz]
19:25  Sorella: I really can't stand much people who won't think for theirselves. I admire your patience ;3
19:25 <-- Phrogz has kicked repxl from ##javascript (Be gone, mmkay?)
19:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [##javascript -o Phrogz]
19:26 * Phrogz feels so bad for no justifiable reason.
19:26  Phrogz: Time to go play ultimate in several inches (and rising) of snow.
19:26  eisd: Sunny over here
19:26  NoiseEee: snow, kriste, where is that Phrogz?
19:26  repxl: wow
19:26  repxl: ty very mutch
19:27  Phrogz: NoiseEee: Boulder, CO
19:27  repxl: Phrogz Thanks very mutch its working
19:27  Phrogz: repxl: ur wlecome annow plz gooo wy.
19:28  repxl: Bye have fun with js . its nice but im noob

19:41  mr_daniel: I just found two libraries which ease the use of WebGL: sylvester and glUtil.js http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/
19:41  mr_daniel: well, I don't know of there is an official site for glUtil.js, but I just go one with my question:
19:43  mr_daniel: This is the source code of sylvester and I think the library does something very wrong: http://dev.chrisbaldelomar.com/ttu/sylvester.js
19:43  mr_daniel: why is a 'eval(...)' at the top of the library?
19:43  mr_daniel: I always thought and read in numerous blog posts, that eval is *very* bad
19:46  Sorella: mr_daniel: it isn't. Now `eval` used for the purposes it wasn't designed is *very* bad.
19:47  eisd: Because it's compressed code, and eval isn't necessarily bad -- it's the same thing as just running regular JS code; it just depends on how you use it, and you can execute arbitrary code with the javascript: pseudo-protocol, a console, etc. anyway
19:47  chani_: Hi all, does anybody have chrome ?
19:48  NoiseEee: lots of people
19:48  Pilate: eval is not necessarily  for compressed code, it is necessarily bad, and it is not the same as running regular js code
19:48  buubot: Pilate: ERROR: syntax error at (eval 32) line 1, near "is not "
19:48  gkatsev: lol, buubot
19:48  eisd: Pilate: eval is being used for the compressed code in question
19:48  eisd: Pilate: And there are still uses for eval
19:49  chani_: i am trying to pass google chrome challenge ... its easy but i get a something wrong ... chromedevtools.appspot.com
19:49  chani_: on last q, when i must get secretpass from console i get only error Failed to load resourse: the server responded with status 404
19:49  Sorella: Pilate: YMMV
19:53  gls\Fr4NgUs:  I would like the value input_duree be multiplied by the value of text_prix
19:53  gls\Fr4NgUs:  http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/21/
19:53  Avi`: Phrogz: hah, you have to draw a line somewhere. I had to jump into a meeting, I was about to just write the code for him so he'd hush =)
19:53  mr_daniel: I don't get it eisd. Why is it necessary to use eval when I have compressed code?
19:53  mr_daniel: in my opinion, compressed code use transformations to make code shorter
19:53  eisd: Because that's the way Dean Edward's packer works, but not all compressors use eval
19:54  eisd: mr_daniel: If you want the uncompressed code, just replace "eval" with "console.log"
19:54  mr_daniel: and that's the point: what is benefit of handling compressed code eval ?
19:54  eisd: mr_daniel: eval isn't necessarily evil.  Don't take what people say on blogs for granted.  For example, json2.js uses eval.  Should we ostracize json2.js?
19:54  mr_daniel: auto uncompression?
19:56  mr_daniel: I think I first need to read some pages about Dean Edward's packer
19:56  Pilate: that is the only valid use eisd
19:56  mr_daniel: for now: thanks for information eisd
19:59  djmccormick:  /join #social
19:59  Sorella: mr_daniel: eval lets you use compress your code with compression algorithms, like zip/stuff and unpack it at runtime.
20:00  Sorella: basically, it get rid of all those bytes you waste by declaring functions, return statements and stuff.
20:01  Sorella: Pilate: eval can be used to implement compilers on top of javascript, fast VMs, and stuff like that.
20:03  gls\Fr4NgUs:  http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/21/ i Want * input value duree * prix
20:04  gls\Fr4NgUs: Pls
