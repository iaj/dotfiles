08:42  reisi: eboyjr: through profiling in chrome it shows me 100% (program) -- could this mean that it has jit'd the javascript 100% or does the profiling always work?
08:45  eboyjr: reisi: Where do you see 100%?
08:46  eboyjr: But I have never used profiling before
08:46  reisi: eboyjr: when i profile in chrome simply clicking an element (the same operation hangs firefox for 2-5 seconds) a few times
08:47  eboyjr: Go to Scripts and set a breakpoint at the beginning of your onclick function
08:47  eboyjr: then step through one-by-one
08:49  eboyjr: I recommend the one with the arrow pointing downward into the dot, unless it is on a line with an external library call then use the one with the arrow going over the dot

10:35  eboyjr: OpenPopup = function(attr) { Goto(blah); }
10:36  taylanub: thanks, i'll try that

10:59  eboyjr: WHat's the best way to cast a custom object to a string? Should I call tostring directly or do ""+object
11:05  cojack: hello
11:08  eboyjr: Looks like object.toString() is faster
11:08  eboyjr: faster than ""+object
11:10  cojack: I gues if you call ""+object method .toString() is called anyway
11:12  cojack: eboyjr: how do you create object?
11:13  eboyjr: cojack: var myObj = {}; is the simple way
11:14  eboyjr: v8> var mine = {toString: function() { return 'foobar'; }}; ""+mine;
11:14  v8bot: eboyjr: "foobar"
11:15  cojack: literal notation
11:17  cojack: eboyjr: but if you haven't toString it'll return a object ;>
11:18  molgrew: what?
11:20  cojack: \s\haven't\don't have
11:22  eboyjr: v8> var mine = {}; ""+mine; //nope
11:22  v8bot: eboyjr: "[object Object]"
11:22  cojack: eboyjr: ;p
11:22  eboyjr: v8> var mine = {}; [""+mine, mine.toString()];
11:22  v8bot: eboyjr: ["[object Object]", "[object Object]"]
11:23  cojack: eboyjr: as you can see you can overload .toString method

12:01  Funcod: hi, i have 2 lines:
12:01  Funcod:           var cbn = docForm.elements[formElem.name]
12:01  Funcod:           if ((cbn.length > 1)&&(cbn[0] !== formElem))
12:01  Funcod: id like to know what will happen on the second line if cbn isn't an array?
12:02  Funcod: (checkboxes)
12:02  Funcod: the console isn't returning anything
12:03  molgrew: should it?
12:03  Funcod: well there's one element
12:03  Funcod: at least
12:04  Funcod: i mean should i use something like isarray?
12:04  molgrew: ok, so cbn could be just that one element, checkboxes don't have a length, so cbn.length = undefined, and undefined > 1 = false, you never enter the body of the if
12:05  Funcod: yes but the rest of the code contie?
12:05  Funcod: continue
12:05  molgrew: yes
12:05  Funcod: why does the console doesn't return undefined?
12:05  molgrew: why should it?
12:05  Funcod: -does
12:07  Funcod: well it returns value of variables and arrays
12:08  Funcod: so i thought id see NAN or undefined in the console too
12:09  molgrew: maybe you should show some code
12:09  molgrew: and explain some more
12:11  Funcod: well formElem is eitheir part of checkbox with the same name
12:11  Funcod: or a single checkbox
12:12  molgrew: maybe
12:12  molgrew: what does that mean?
12:13  Funcod: docForm.elements[formElem.name] is an input
12:13  Funcod: of type checkbox
12:14  Funcod: if there's only one input
12:14  Funcod: it's not an array
12:14  molgrew: and that automatically means "the console", whatever that acutally means, should output anything?
12:14  Funcod: and i should change something in my code to handle single checkbox
12:14  Funcod: right?
12:15  Funcod: ...sorry can't explain better
12:16  Funcod: i guess im fine if it's undefined
12:18  Funcod: i wasn't really keen on using isarray cause it's recent

12:26  lifechamp: how to query html to find specific tags?
12:26  eboyjr: jquery
12:26  lifechamp: what specifically there?
12:26  eboyjr: The $() selector function
12:26  Funcod: lol
12:27  eboyjr: Or document.getElementsByTagName('element') returns an array of all the elements with that tag name
12:27  eboyjr: im lazy so i just say jquery
12:27  Funcod: yeah :)
12:27  lifechamp: thx will try. using this: http://jquery.com/
12:27  lifechamp: err, this: http://jquery.hohli.com/, for php
12:29  Funcod: how to make the firebug console to return 'undefined' when something is undefined?
12:29  Funcod: instead of doing = 'undefined'
12:30  eboyjr: Why?
12:30  cojack: Funcod: instanceof
12:30  Funcod: yeah forgot about that
12:30  Funcod: thx :)
12:30  eboyjr: instanceof undefined?
12:31  eboyjr: I don't think so
12:31  eboyjr: v8> undefined instanceof undefined
12:31  v8bot: eboyjr: TypeError: Expecting a function in instanceof check, but got undefined
12:31  cojack: or == 'undefined'
12:31  molgrew: Funcod: you don't have to do anything
12:31  eboyjr: yeah i was about to say
12:31  Funcod: ?
12:31  cojack: v8> a == 'undefined'
12:31  v8bot: cojack: ReferenceError: a is not defined
12:31  Funcod: if it doesn't return anything

12:32  eboyjr: cojack: typeof a == "undefined"

12:32  molgrew: Funcod: you are typing directly in the console?
12:32  Funcod: ok lemme check my version
12:32  Funcod: no

12:33  vvv35103: hi, how can i create associative array in js? something like arr=['vvv': 'cccc']; but with correct syntax?
12:33  kaitocracy: vvv35103: everything in javascript is associative array
12:33  Funcod: firebug 1.5.4
12:33  Funcod: is that too old?
12:33  kaitocracy: vvv35103: {a: 'something', b: 'something else' }
12:33  vvv35103: that's an object, kaitocracy
12:33  vvv35103: not array
12:34  kaitocracy: vvv35103: read ^^^ everything in javascript is associative array
12:34  molgrew: vvv35103: there is no such thing as associative arrays in js
12:34  molgrew: Funcod: I thought you were using the log function, you'd have to hack firebug to make it do what you want
12:34  Funcod: oh
12:35  Funcod: but if a line doesn't return anything
12:35  Funcod: it's not automatically undefined
12:35  Funcod: it could be something else?
12:35  molgrew: no, it's undefined
12:36  Funcod: so NAN and NULL are returned in the console?
12:36  molgrew: yes
12:37  Funcod: if that's the case molgrew i wonder why firebug doesn't the fact that it's undefined (makes sense to me)
12:37  Funcod: -the fact + show

12:38  d_mitar: what is the order of bubbling? topmost to bottom-most el?
12:39  d_mitar: or parent to child
12:39  Funcod: depends
12:39  Funcod: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
12:40  Reecieboy: <div id='here'>&nbsp;</div> would document.location('#here') do the job so it takes u down to the id.
12:40  molgrew: bubbling is always in 1 direction, from the target upwards through the ancestors
12:41  molgrew: Reecieboy: no
12:41  d_mitar: ta
12:42  Reecieboy: how would i go about achieving this. like if the password doesnt match.. i need it to scroll up to the password so they can easily notice the error message
12:42  d_mitar: heh. don't ever .stop() events when you don't have to. makes work on things like heatmapping / click logging very hard :)
12:42  d_mitar: when you rely on the event to bubble
12:42  d_mitar: :)
12:47  Funcod: is there an advantage of using ajax over ahah if i want to use POST on a form?
12:49  d_mitar: using ajax is super cool and leaves management feeling as if they are utilising a sufficient amount of buzzword technologies to appear hip
12:50  Funcod: that's what i thought
12:51  kaitocracy: what is ahah?
12:51  Funcod: unless i wanna do dom manipulation and xpath stuff
12:51  Funcod: im fine with ahah
12:51  kaitocracy: ??? what is ahah?
12:51  Funcod: ahah = async http mmmh lemme remember

12:53  eboyjr: im gonna make my own protocol called boohoo
12:54  kaitocracy: that is idiotic, XMLHttpRequest will return whatever text your web server tells it to return
12:54  kaitocracy: there is no need for another acronym
12:54  kaitocracy: especially one as asinine sounding as ahah, which for the record management would definitely NOT be impressed with
12:54  d_mitar: somebody should make one called banana so that you can use it with APE

12:55  kaitocracy: "Oh wow that looks very web 2.0; insert some buzzwords... AJAX"
12:55  kaitocracy: "Actually that is ahah"
12:55  eboyjr: it should be ajaj (spanish way of laughing, but also asynchronous javascript and json)
12:55  kaitocracy: "wtf?"
12:55  Funcod: JSON = JASON
12:55  Funcod: greece love
12:56  d_mitar: 's ok till they come to you and ask you to explain yourself why you're not using jquery and put forward we should be using it because nnnn uses it and they make millions
12:57  kaitocracy: oh god I hate jQuery
12:57  Funcod: +1
12:57  kaitocracy: I don't understand why the shittest techs always become the most popular
12:57  kaitocracy: Java, PHP, etc.
12:57  Funcod: like my library though
12:57  kaitocracy: I'm rewriting our entire application in PHP from Rails
12:58  d_mitar: seriously, i am being asked to consider refactoring over 20k lines of js code from mootools to jquery so the company is less dependent on me being there
12:58  Funcod: lame.
12:59  eboyjr: d_mitar: don't they pay you to be there?
12:59  d_mitar: something about me messing up the exit strategy
12:59  d_mitar: :/
12:59  kaitocracy: does anyone here use ExtJS?
12:59  d_mitar: what if i leave though? they will have a bit more difficulty finding a dev with mootools whereas everyone puts jquery on their CV just to be safe
13:00  d_mitar: even if they don't know what $ means
13:00  kaitocracy: oh and speaking of things that are idiotic: cappuccino
13:00  eboyjr: hehe
13:00  kaitocracy: objective C added things like object orientation and multiple dispatch etc. to C
13:00  kaitocracy: javascript ALREADY HAS THAT
13:01  eboyjr: They were just some mac guys who couldn't get away from it

13:36  Adriaan: hi, how can I define an object's variable from a variable
13:36  Adriaan: say: var name = 'abcefg'; i want object.abcdefg = 'something';
13:36  eboyjr: Adriaan: You can't define anything from a variable
13:36  Maxdamantus: object[name] = "something"
13:36  eboyjr: Adriaan: object[name] = 'something'
13:36  Adriaan: ah, :)
13:36  Adriaan: thanks!
13:47  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: I've given up on making the C parser in C, I'm going to do it in Javascript
13:47  eboyjr: I already coded the js output functions http://eboyjr.ath.cx:8080/testing/ctojs/jssrc/jscode/
13:47  Maxdamantus: Sounds reasonable.
13:49  Maxdamantus: It's not meant to be a proper implementation of C, is it?
13:50  eboyjr: Why shouldn't it be? I would like it to be. I've defined a bunch of header macros to make it more compatibile with js
13:52  Maxdamantus: C-specific aspects usually take place in things like malloc, pointer to struct conversions, conversion to unsigned char*, union, ..
13:54  eboyjr: I will apply flags to each C object being translated that say that it will be cast to certain things. If a structure pointers is cast to another structure points, I set a flag saying that it needs to be translated differently since a simple JS object for a struct won't do
13:56  Maxdamantus: ((struct { int foo; } *)&((struct { int bar; double baz; }){ 42, 84.0 }))->foo
13:58  eboyjr: Well..
13:58  Maxdamantus: Hm.
13:58  eboyjr: Once I figure out that is doing...
13:59  eboyjr: It probably evaluates to 42
13:59  Maxdamantus: It does.
14:01  eboyjr: A compiler can figure that out :)
14:01  eboyjr: gcc does http://eboyjr.ath.cx:8080/testing/ctoasm/
14:02  Maxdamantus: Yeah, but if it wasn't just a compound literal.
14:02  eboyjr: Okay so first we have a structure { int 42, double 84.0 }
14:03  eboyjr: We put that in the js virtual ram and get its 'address' (index)
14:03  Maxdamantus: Yeah, I guess that might make sense in your model.
14:03  Maxdamantus: But what is sizeof(struct { int bar; double baz; })?
14:04  eboyjr: But if we don't need to use the vram, that I will try not to for readability :)
14:04  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: 2 haha
14:04  eboyjr: CHAR_BIT is 16
14:05 * Maxdamantus was thinking about all this a while ago, can't remember what I thought. :(
14:05  eboyjr: yeah, same here actually
14:05  eboyjr: I could be extremely strict in that case
14:06  Maxdamantus: Something I couldn't find an absolute answer to is whether every object must be able to be represented as a series of bits.
14:06  eboyjr: and create a function to do floating point operations on a string of chars (bytes)
14:07  eboyjr: According to the standard, I don't think so
14:07  eboyjr: Since you can't guarantee what those bits will be
14:07  eboyjr: except in the case of char and '0'-'9'
14:07  eboyjr: which javascript can support
14:07  Maxdamantus: No, you can't guarantee *what* they will be on any given implementation.
14:07  Maxdamantus: (at least)
14:08  eboyjr: I would say, as soon as the bits are read, change the method of reading it
14:09  Sembiance: morning :)
14:09  Maxdamantus: But there's things like memcmp, which require the ability to compare every byte by doing something like: unsigned char *a1 = &anything1, *a2 = &anything2; a1[0] == a2[0] .. etc
14:10  Maxdamantus: or even, a1[0] - a2[0] == 0
14:11  eboyjr: Thank god its a std library function
14:11  eboyjr: I can implement it in javascript so I don't have to follow spec so i can do whatever the hell i want to do
14:11  Maxdamantus: (It should return an integer of the same sign as the first a1[x] - a2[x] for x where a1[x] - a2[x])
14:12  Maxdamantus: No, but it needs to be able to be implemented that way.
14:12  eboyjr: Nuh uh
14:12  eboyjr: I don't think so
14:12  eboyjr: You can't implemente va_args in C
14:12  eboyjr: va_start, etc
14:12  Maxdamantus: No, that's part of the language.
14:13  eboyjr: So I just use javascript's handy dandy function argument list
14:13  eboyjr: memcmp is also part of the language
14:13  Maxdamantus: There are other library functions you can't necessarily implement in C though, but that doesn't mean memcmp can't be implemented.
14:13  Maxdamantus: memcmp is part of the library.
14:14  eboyjr: How is va_args() part of the language while memcmp part of the library?
14:14  Maxdamantus: Because it involves interaction with types.
14:15  eboyjr: oh va_start is a macro
14:16  eboyjr: I'll figure it out once I get there I guess.
14:16  Maxdamantus: Mm, but it'll need to reduce to some sort of language hack.
14:17  Maxdamantus: It needs to consider for example that char is promoted to int (or maybe something else, dunno), so it can't just be a sizeof-based macro.
14:18  Maxdamantus: Hm, maybe it can be implemented.
14:18 --- d_mitar is now known as coda^
14:18  Maxdamantus: nvm, it could figure out the type stuff, but it can't simply *grab* the arguments from somewhere.
14:20  Maxdamantus: Since you could have something like: #define va_arg(a, b) __va_arg(a, #b)
14:21  Maxdamantus: Hm, rather, va_arg(a, b) (*((b)*)__va_arg(a, #b))
14:23  eboyjr: I'm allowed to do #define va_arg(a, b) __asm__("JSCOmpilerThing.va_arg(" a ", " #b "))
14:23  Maxdamantus: Sure. You'd probably want #a too btw
14:24  eboyjr: Ah yeah
14:25  eboyjr: __asm__("alert(\"I am C code :)\");"); that will be fun
14:31  eboyjr: Js is weird.. I can put labels before any statement. if, while, break, continue, throw, delete, try, var, ; but I can't do anything with it unless its on a loop
14:31  Maxdamantus: JS is weird. It tries inserting semicolons on certain errors.

14:45  Sorella: except it doesn't have cute lambdas

15:44  callen: Shwaiil: if you add inputs and at some point after that, submit the form, those inputs will be included if the HTML is correct. That's just how it works.

16:48  Maxdamantus: /disconnect
16:49  Maxdamantus: Should learn how to empty irssi's throttle buffer.
16:51 --- Wamanuz6 is now known as MrOpposite
17:00  Gaius: Maxdamantus: thx for links. cya
17:05  Shwaiil: Q: Whats the function to lowercase a string ? lets say var x = 'SOME TEXT'; string.toLowerCase( x ) ? Tks for looking
17:06  Pilate: you couldnt google that question?
17:07  Shwaiil: Pilate, while doing it, I allways ask too
17:07 --- Guest63840 is now known as jfalvarez
17:07  Shwaiil: also test stuff that I keep finding
17:07  Shwaiil: I dont know whats wrong with that
17:08  Shwaiil: thanks for looking anyway
17:08  Pilate: the fact that it takes two seconds to find via searching is whats wrong with it
17:08  molgrew: you should bookmark some kind of language reference, then you can look yourself
17:08  Shwaiil: for js I dont know a good ref page
17:09  SolarBoom: `js ref @ Shwaiil
17:09  jsBot: Shwaiil: js ref: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript , http://devedge-temp.mozilla.org/central/javascript/index_en.html , http://phrogz.net/ObjJob/ , JScript@MSDN: http://tinyurl.com/9pk3l , www.crockford.com/javascript/
17:10  Shwaiil: SolarBoom, tks
17:10  SolarBoom: np
17:11  SolarBoom: also google js
17:11  Sorella: googling JS would probably give him W3Schools JS ref, which is totally not a good ref page
17:12  gkatsev: I always add mdc to my searches
17:12  SolarBoom: okay, thasnk for attention
17:17  zomg: While w3schools may be wrong in places I must say that it's actually been right for when I ever had used it
17:17  zomg: So I dunno :P
17:20  Gregor: zomg: It tends to be "right" in the "the code runs" sense, but wrong in the "the code uses standards instead of weird IE extensions that have been adopted by other browsers poorly for compatibility" sense.
17:20  zomg: Can you give some example where it does that?
17:21  Gregor: zomg: First page I clicked on :P. On the JS guidelines page it recommends breaking up strings with backslashes, which is not standard ECMAScript.
17:22  zomg: but works =)
17:23  Pilate: thats what he said
17:23  Gregor: Bleh, on this page it uses double-equals for a nullcheck, that's gross ...
17:23  Gregor: Oh good, it uses with; admittedly that's totally standards-compliant, but that's just bad in general :P
17:24  zomg: :D
17:24  Sorella: I use double equals for null checks, when I also want to test for undefined
17:24  zomg: I use double equals unless I specifically need a precise check
17:24  KU0N: hello
17:24  Pilate: so as you can see, w3s has had a negative effect on your practices
17:25  zomg: Yes, it's clearly a bad idea to use less code to do more
17:25  KU0N: I was wondering if anybody knew a good book to begin javascript, in japanese. Aimed at someone with no programming expertise.
17:25  Pilate: its clearly a better idea to argue things you dont understand than admit you're wrong
17:25  Sorella: zomg ≣ you just defined jQuery :3
17:25  KU0N: I googled for a while, but maybe some of you has an idea.
17:25  zomg: Sorella: which I don't particularily like ;)
17:26 * Sorella doesn't like jQuery either
17:26  Gregor: KU0N: In Japanese ... yikes, not likely to get anybody who knows, but you could idle a bit and see if you get lucky.
17:26  Gregor: Oh for cripes sake it uses document.forms. DOCUMENT DOT FRIGGIN' FORMS
17:26  zomg: KU0N: might be a good idea to find one in english then see if there's a translation
17:26  molgrew: what's wrong with document.forms?
17:26  KU0N: yea, that too
17:27  Gregor: molgrew: Surely you jest? It's just an indexed array of the forms ... if the page isn't EXACTLY how you expect it to be (like, ohhh, an ad has decided to stick a form in for shits and giggles), then you never know which form is which without doing inspection, which would be much easier with a real function like getElementById.
17:28  Gregor: Or, for that matter, somebody's using GreaseMonkey and has their own form in there.
17:28  molgrew: give it a name?
17:28  Sorella: KU0N ≣ can't you read one in english? I think there's a translation of a Dmitri's article to japanese, but well, it's just an introductory article. And I'm not sure how it stands on the `for people with no programming expertise` thing. You'd get much more books in japanese for Ruby, certainly.
17:28  Gregor: molgrew: Yes ... and with a name, document.forms is useless.
17:29  Gregor: molgrew: Then you just use document.getElementById
17:29  KU0N: Sorella: not for me. Yea, maybe I should look into ruby.
17:29  molgrew: but with a name getElementById is useless?
17:30  KU0N: put an id on it, load jquery, use $('#myForm') and enjoy life
17:30  Gregor: molgrew: I assumed you meant an ID :P
17:30  Gregor: http://w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_form_elements <-- surely this is a joke.
17:30  Gregor: That is FLAT-OUT WRONG.
17:31  Gregor: Oy, I can't read that page any more X_X
17:32  Sorella: document.write <3
17:32  KU0N: molgrew: if you really wanna put a name on your form, load jquery, do $('form[name=myForm]') and enjoy life all the same.
17:33  gkatsev: lol, that's painful
17:33  Sorella: ugh, jQuery
17:33  gkatsev: Sorella: it does have its uses.
17:33  Sorella: I'd rather use Prototype
17:33 * Sorella flees
17:34  gkatsev: that works too
17:34  KU0N: yea
17:34  gkatsev: probably.
17:34  KU0N: use what fits you.
17:34  KU0N: But molgrew, put id on your elements if you need to reference them.
17:35  gkatsev: In Soviet Russia you fit in lib.
17:35  Sorella: ehe
17:35  gkatsev: http://www.instantrimshot.com
17:36  Gregor: Sorella: I wasn't even complaining about document.write, which very-occasionally has legit uses. <bleh>.elements to get all the input fields of a form? That's ... that's misleading and wrong. It is not an effective way to accomplish what they claim it does ... it's just ... bad.
17:36  Sorella: I'm out of DOM lib options for the project I'm working on. Prototype extends native objects, which is nice when you know what code you're executing (which is not the case here), Fuse.js fixes that but has no documentation whatsoever, jQuery is wierd and bloated, all other libs I know of are also bloated.
17:36  Gregor: s/wierd/wired/
17:37  Gregor: jQuery is suspended by a system of ropes and pullies.
17:37  Gregor: And apparently that's spelled "pulleys" :P
17:37  gkatsev: isn't Prototype just as bloated as jQuery?
17:38  Gregor: gkatsev: When you spread the bloat around all the native objects, it doesn't LOOK as bloated because there's no singular bloated interface.
17:38  Sorella: yeah, but I'd actually use the additional bloat Prototype provides.
17:38  gkatsev: lol
17:38  Sorella: I'd like just a plain and simple DOM lib tho, that just takes care of sanitizing DOM manipulation and nothing else...
17:38  js_: can people just stop caring about "bloat", i hate that word in this sense
17:39  js_: Sorella: i wanted that too, then i started building applications
17:39  FireFly: <gkatsev> In Soviet Russia you fit in lib.
17:39  FireFly: I DO fit in a library
17:39  gkatsev: lol
17:39  FireFly: They're usually not that small
17:39  Sorella: lol
17:39  KU0N: in most the app I've done I've been happy with jquery
17:40  gkatsev: FireFly: I never said it made any sense...
17:40  FireFly: :3
17:40  FireFly: rue
17:40  FireFly: with a t
17:40  KU0N: now I work on a sproutcore app
17:40  KU0N: layout pain, I wanna kill myself
17:40  TheSheep: In Soviet Russia the bugs report you...
17:45  stew-a: if i include a javascript file from another domain, is it the cookies from my site that get sent, or the cookies from the other domain?
17:45  vettels: Could anyone help me out please?
17:46  GarethAdams|Work: stew-a: the cookies from your domain will only be sent with requests to your domain, cookies from the other domain will only be sent in requests to the other domain
17:46  Sorella: vettels ≣ no :<
17:46  Sorella: `help @ vettels
17:46  jsBot: vettels: help: Paste the Javascript (only the portions relevant to your problem) in a pastebin (see `paste), and tell us what you expected, what else you tried and what actually happened. You might also consider reading: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/05/05/why_we_wont_help_you/
17:47  vettels: Okay then.  Well I'm a real novice, and I've posted my code here http://pastie.org/1332730
17:47  vettels: Is that ok?
17:48  vettels: You should be able to tell what I want it to do, and also that it doesn't work =S
17:50  stew-a: GarethAdams|Work: thanks, i thoght i remembered reading something wierd about cross domain cookies and how they were bad, although it might have been a case of 'include script from another domain to steal data about authenticated user from that domain'
17:51  GarethAdams|Work: stew-a: browser protection is set up not to allow you access to data loaded from other domains
17:52  vettels: Would anyone mind taking a look at http://pastie.org/1332730 for me please?
17:53  vettels: `help
17:53  jsBot: help: Paste the Javascript (only the portions relevant to your problem) in a pastebin (see `paste), and tell us what you expected, what else you tried and what actually happened. You might also consider reading: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/05/05/why_we_wont_help_you/
17:57  k1ng: anyone got COD: black ops for pc?
17:57 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
17:58 * Sorella doesn't like COD or FPS-ish games
18:02  punkoff: Hello. I need to draw a complex node graph (>1000 nodes connected with each other). Can javascript canvas handle that or I need to go for Flash or pre-rendered image?
18:02  withanx: I have an HTML response coming back from an AJAX request that I'd like to display in a modal window, the problem is that it's a full HTML page.  Can ayone think of a good way to display this content?  Is it possible to display an iframe with content from a string?
18:04  Sorella: punkoff ≣ yeah, canvas can handle that.
18:05  Sorella: punkoff ≣ not sure what would be the performance for making changes in the graph in real time, but just rendering to the graph is okay. At any case, if you need to update the graph frequently, you could perform the computation asynchronously (so you don't block the UI thread) or in the background using webWorkers.
18:17  punkoff: Sorella, canvas works just fine, thanks
18:19 --- hacked_ is now known as hacked
18:23  Avi`: I cannot believe twice in one day I wished for a switch case statement that could handle multiple cases
18:23  Avi`: yet I didn't want to turn it into an if/else bracket. something must be wrong with me
18:24  LakWork_: 'wished for'?
18:24  Gregor: Avi`: ... surely you jest.
18:24  Avi`: like case 'a' 'b' :
18:24  Avi`: please tell me you can't do that
18:24  Gregor: js> switch (3) { case 1: case 3: /* it's 1 or 3! */ break; default: /* it's not! */ }
18:24  LakWork_: you cannot
18:24  gbot2: Gregor: undefined
18:25  Gregor: js> var res = ""; switch (3) { case 1: case 3: res = "it's 1 or 3!"; break; default: res = "it's not!" } res
18:25  gbot2: Gregor: "it's 1 or 3!"
18:25  Avi`: oh you just let the case cascade down
18:25  LakWork_: ya you can stack cases but they aren't mutually inclusive
18:25  LakWork_: i.e. 1 OR 3 not 1 AND 3
18:25  Avi`: yeah, i ended up re-writing the object before i pass it into the switch
18:25  Gregor: And doesn't make sense for case statements, they're equality comparisons X_X
18:25  Avi`: so if its 1 or 3, make it just one of them =)
18:25  Gregor: Is this value both 1 and 3? If so, the universe is imploding; otherwise, happiness.
18:26  Avi`: e.g. var x = 1; if x= 1; x=3, switch(x) case: x
18:26  LakWork_: lol
18:26  Avi`: =)
18:26  Avi`: <--- hacker
18:26  LakWork_: that code is lulzy
18:26  Avi`: i mean, im not assigning X
18:26  Avi`: x is either one thing or another. i just make it into the other thing if its one of them so i only have 1 case
18:26 * Avi` shrugs
18:26  Avi`: i should cascade the case =)
18:27  Gregor: I can't even begin to decipher what that code is supposed to do or mean.
18:27  Avi`: lol, im sorry it was not really expressive
18:27  Avi`: basically, iphones and ipods identify as different devices
18:28  Avi`: but the apps that run on them are the exact same
18:28  Avi`: hence no need to write different code
18:28  Avi`: so if you are switching on ipad, iphone and ipod, you really only want to switch on ipad & iphone || ipod
18:28  Gregor: Basically, Firefox and Chrome identify as different browsers.
18:28  Gregor: But the code that runs ont hem are the exact same.
18:29  Gregor: Hence no need to write different code.
18:29  Avi`: sure, but if you are switching on browser
18:29  Avi`: you'd get a special case for firefox, and chrome
18:29  Avi`: so i just turn firefox, into chrome
18:29  Avi`: =p
18:30  sshakir: What is "Prototyping against the Object object"? Can someone give me an example of this?
18:30  Gregor: Also, basically the iPhone and iPad are the same device, minus features of course.
18:30  Pilum: sshakir: Bad practice is what it is.
18:30  Pilum: `eloquent @ sshakir
18:30  jsBot: sshakir: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
18:31  Pilum: Specifically chapter 8 if you want to skip ahead.
18:36  sshakir: pilum: thank you...glanced over chapter...guess I need to learn exactly what prototyping is first
18:39  Sorella: Pilum ≣ but Object.prototype.crashYerForIn sounds like fun .-.
18:40  Gregor: `prototypes @ sshakir
18:40  gbot2: sshakir: JavaScript is a prototype-based object oriented programming language. What this means is that rather than having a differentiated concept of a "class" that stores the behavior and set of properties of the associated objects, objects simply inherit their behavior from other objects, called prototypes. See section eight of http://eloquentjavascript.net/ for more information.
18:49  jeremyw: Great link...I just read up on prototype-based stuff yesterday but that book seems like a great read.
18:49  Sorella: tbh, I don't like JavaScript's implementation of prototypal based inheritance. All the more after reading about how Lua handles it.
18:50  TheSheep: Sorella: sure, bash js, everybody does it
18:50  Sorella: I'm not bashing JS
18:50  TheSheep: Sorella: how long did it have until it went to production again?
18:51  Sorella: I just don't like the thing about [[Prototype]] only being set by a constructor, after being explicitly instantiated .-.
18:52  TheSheep: ah, I suppose that's to force people to use that ridiculous new operator
18:52  Sorella: you can circumvent the new operator all over your code by auto-instantiating the object in the constructor, and returning that instance
18:53  Sorella: doesn't work with Date though
18:53  Sorella: unless you rewrite it...
18:53  TheSheep: lipstick on a pig
18:55  Sorella: Object.create isn't that bad tho
18:55  TheSheep: hm...
18:55  TheSheep: He started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995, working on JavaScript...
18:55  TheSheep: LiveScript was the official name for the language when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995.
18:56  TheSheep: design and implement a language in 5 months
18:56  TheSheep: also, I've heard that they actually change the syntax from lisp-ish to more c-ish midway...
18:57  Sorella: having a lisp-ish syntax would be pretty interesting
18:57  TheSheep: lisp has no syntax, it's just a parse tree...
18:57  Sorella: sure the language design was rushed and all, but still...
18:58  Sorella: the minimalism of lisp is what makes it so powerful
18:58  Sorella: (and the macro system...)
18:58  TheSheep: I hate metaprogramming
18:58  Sorella: ehe
18:58  TheSheep: it's how you make programs that outsmart you
19:02  Sorella: naw
19:02  Sorella: they already do
19:02  Sorella: except when dialogue is involved...
19:02  TheSheep: I meant bugs that outsmart you
19:05  sshakir: thanks Gregor
19:07  Avi`: Gregor: thats not technically true from a programming standpoint
19:07  Avi`: Gregor: for example, iPads have popovers, and iphones/ipod touches do not
19:07  Avi`: they have modal dialogs
19:07  punkoff: Another problem: it seems that Canvas doesn't support overflow:auto
19:08  Avi`: which, from a programming standpoint, means in the ipad can see a lot more when a popover is invoked, but in a modal you see nothing but the menu on the iphone
19:08  Avi`: and the objects are totally different objects
19:08  Avi`: which again, really matters from a programming standpoint
19:10  Avi`: Gregor: anyway, when writing code for both, atleast with automation code, its different enough to fork the code
19:10  JuJuBee: Im looking to protect a form so a user gets an alert if they try to navigate away from a page if they made changes and did not submit...
