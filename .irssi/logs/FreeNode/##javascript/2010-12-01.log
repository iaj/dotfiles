00:00  iaj: gkatsev: you around?
00:01  js_: what is it that hits performance the most, a very big dom tree, or manipulating the tree a lot (adding/removing nodes)?
00:01  SamuraiDio: EvanR-work, actually, what i need is to change something like ÁÀÂÃ to A
00:01  iaj: gkatsev, may I ask are you using fb1.7 and ff4.0?  - and if so is the completion system on the console window on firebug working?
00:02  EvanR-work: SamuraiDio: i figured that. well find a unicode processing lib
00:02  AZ2: js_: wouldn't that be specific to the browser? like FF is ok with some things that chrome does super fast and IE dies on, and vice versa
00:03  Sorella: js_ ≣ neither. The big performance issue with the DOOM are the reflows. Opera has an article about it.
00:03  Sorella: of course, manipulating the DOOM tree triggers a shitload of reflows...
00:10  js_: Sorella: thanks, i'll try to search it
00:11  js_: Sorella: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/efficient-javascript/?page=all this one?
00:11  js_: seems like good reading anyhow
00:11  AZ2: ok, so i made the modification to the code and tried a few variations as well as taking a piece outside of the rest of the code. Again, I can't get a stupid class on image to alert the div and I'm sure I'm making a stupid easily fixed mistake, but I have literally spent about 6 hours on it so I'd be very grateful for help http://www.archmageempires.com/game/map2.php
00:12  Sorella: js_ ≣ yes. The `repain and reflow` part of the DOM page.
00:20  peeps[lappy]: AZ2, what part of that cod are we supposed to be looking at?

00:38  Lurzino: I need a little help on my little weird issue: I have a site on http://www.vacanze-viaggi.eu, when clicking on "Chi siamo" it should be expected a substitution of div with the help of $(".square").replaceWith(divblock); but it doesn't do that; indeed locally on my usb pen with XAMPP it works... why?
00:38  Lurzino: thanks in advance to all!! :))
00:54  jwl: how do you check that an array is empty?
00:54  EvanR: length == 0
00:55  jwl: thanks
00:55  EvanR: function empty(a){ return a.length == 0; }

03:27  ExorcistToGo: I started learning JavaScript last week and have read a considerable amount/ Is there any good resource on how to use timers correctly for multiple animations occuring at once while maintaining brower responsiveness?
03:27  themiddleman: css3 :)
03:27  fruitwerks: lol
03:29  Wes-: ExorcistToGo:  understand the event model (reactor pattern) thoroughly - that is the key
03:34  ExorcistToGo: Wes-: Is this a pattern that some of the Libraries use to wrap stuff into, like JQuery and Dojo?
03:34  Wes-: No, it's a programming pattern. Wikipedia et al know more
03:43 --- TheNetuno is now known as Guest13492
03:45  ExorcistToGo: Wes-: Any ideas about where I might be able to look at client side JavaScript code that uses the reactor patern?
03:45  Wes-: ExorcistToGo: The *browser* is the reactor
03:45  Wes-: so any client side code does
03:45  jwl: how do I check that an variable is an object literal?
03:46  Wes-: jwl: you don't
03:46  fatbrain: heh
03:46  jwl: you mean variable value is an object literal and not the variable?
03:47  ExorcistToGo: Wes-: Is this similar at all to an Event Aggregator pattern?
03:49  Wes-: ExorcistToGo: Not really. Okay. Here is the zen of it all.  The browser runs in a loop.  It looks at a list of crap to do.  It pulls each thing off the list and does it in turn.  You put things on the list with events (timeout is an event, so is a mouse click).  That's it.
03:49  Wes-: Nothing will interrupt your code
03:49  Wes-: so if you write a long loop, you lose interactivity
03:49  ExorcistToGo: light turns on
03:49  ExorcistToGo: thanks
03:50  Gregor: Wes-: "Nothing will interrupt your code" isn't quite true, as long-running events will usually be killed by the browser (in the case of FF, on Chrome IIRC it'll just happily let that tab be frozen as punishment for being stupid)
03:50  Gregor: But yes, I'm being pedantic :P
03:50  AZ2: noob to JS question: you don't have a separate event handler, you have to loop through events? e.g. not a true event system but a polling system only?
03:50  Wes-: gregor: True, but in 10th grade science, we tell students F=ma and it allows them to solve problems ;)
03:51  Wes-: az2: define "true event system"
03:51  ExorcistToGo: F = d(mv)/dt
03:51  ExorcistToGo: heh
03:51  Wes-: ExorcistToGo: einstein
03:52  AZ2: Well if you want to get really really accurate, NASA has a hardware solution that when something requests hardware, it gets it immediately - no polling of hardware IRQ, no cycling through I/O. Everything else is a gradient of that.
03:53  Nanobot: Wes-: What does Full Metal Alchemist have to do with this?
03:53  ExorcistToGo: Newton was bothered that there were gravitational and Iinertial mass were different things but seemed to be always equal. Anyway, it is interesting.
03:53  Wes-: oh yeah
03:53  Wes-: I was thinking of length/time dialation
03:53  Gregor: AZ2: Exactly how events propagate from hardware to the OS to the browser to JavaScript is entirely implementation-defined, the only common aspect is that it's non-preemptive.
03:54  iateadonut: i've got a strange problem: i'm using two arrays to pass a function (jg.drawPolygon(arrayhl01, arrayhl02)) and when i make the arrays as so: arrayhl01 = new Array(161,283,277,219); - the script has no problem and draws the polygon as it should, but when i use a script to split a comma separated element and then push it into the variables, the script draws a much different polygon, even though both arrays display the same when di
03:54  Nanobot: Here's all I know about Newton: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyI3IL46yq4
03:54  AZ2: so it is more like python's coroutines and less like erlang
03:55  Gregor: iateadonut: When you string.split, each element is a string. Perhaps your display method is sensitive to the distinction between string elements and numeric elements. e.g. "5" + 5 is 55, but 5 + 5 is of course 10.
03:55  AZ2: or a python only example, more like the default socket code, and less like Twisted
03:55 --- qhoxie_ is now known as qhoxie
03:56  iateadonut: ah... how do i find out if it is numeric or string, and how would i change one to the other?
03:57  Gregor: js> var x = "5.5"; var y = parseInt(x, 10); var z = Number(x); [x, typeof(x), y, typeof(y), z, typeof(z)] // iateadonut
03:57  gbot2: Gregor: ["5.5","string",5,"number",5.5,"number"]
03:58  Wes-: az2: It's not all like co-routines
03:58  Wes-: co-routines have multiple stacks active simultaneously
03:58  Wes-: It's more like   while(1) { do(this); do(that); }
03:59  Wes-: this and that never run at the same time, and unwind their stacks in between
03:59  NexT||eVo: hi here can help me with simple ajax script-module for joomla?
04:00  iateadonut: is there something simpler like "alert(arrayhl01[0].whatkindofelement);" ?
04:00  AZ2: Wes-: wow that is horrible :/ so events are just variables waiting to get polled?
04:00  iateadonut: oh... sorry.
04:01  Maxdamantus: AZ2: they're not really variables.
04:01  Maxdamantus: It's not horrible, it's logical.
04:01  Maxdamantus: You don't need a complex threading system.
04:01  NexT||eVo: my eng lang skills low but, on my site momot-guitars.com i have Poll module with ajax anywhere he works perfect, but in article he not showing... http://www.momot-guitars.com/ru/articles/ here he works but in any article from this category not..
04:01  Gregor: <Gregor> AZ2: Exactly how events propagate from hardware to the OS to the browser to JavaScript is entirely implementation-defined, the only common aspect is that it's non-preemptive.
04:01  iateadonut: you were right; string and a number.
04:02  Gregor: iateadonut: Of course I was right *ha ha ha*
04:02  NexT||eVo: its only one bug with this module and i dont know that i need to do.. for fix that
04:02  Maxdamantus: while(1) { next = nextScheduled(); sleep(next); next.do(); }
04:02  Maxdamantus: while(1) { next = nextScheduled(); sleep(next.timeUntil()); next.do(); }
04:02  AZ2: Maxdamantus: 5 years I would have completely agreed with you, but with the push toward Cloud apps, we're basically using JS on the front end to add responsiveness
04:02  ExorcistToGo: In theory you could use a special exec function that would automatically make execution almost atomic, is this right?
04:02  NexT||eVo: iateadonut, can help?
04:03  Maxdamantus: AZ2: you shouldn't need threads for responsive UIs.
04:03  iateadonut: what?
04:04  Maxdamantus: Maybe one thread per UI (page) - that should be far enough.
04:04  Gregor: In time, as cores outnumber activities and JS becomes a more general-purpose language, JS WILL need to adapt and have true threading of some kind.
04:04  NexT||eVo: iateadonut, what, what?
04:04  iateadonut: script works now... also curious, i'm using setInterval twice, one with a 1200 and one with 1000 to make a blinking effect - there's a better way to do that, right?
04:05  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: Fascinating observation.
04:05  Maxdamantus: No, we'll just be able to use more pages simultaneously.
04:06  Gregor: Gregor: "As cores outnumber activities"
04:06  Gregor: Erm
04:06  Maxdamantus: The processing capabilities of each core will still increase.
04:06  Gregor: <Gregor> That :P
04:06  Gregor: Maxdamantus: Not much.
04:06  AZ2: Gregor: I agree, especially since we're looking at more Push technology like Comet, we're asking for events, people button mash. With the cores growing, everything needs to be multithreaded, and there will be people who just sit and run 1-2 cloud apps... and cloud apps mean JS
04:07  Gregor: Maxdamantus: If current trends continue, we will have systems with hundreds of cores barely more powerful than our current cores. And CS as it stands is wildly unsuited to do that.
04:07  AZ2: Maxd: they are not going to increase much at all, every addition of cores slows down the clock speed drastically and when they get back to the original clock speed, they add more cores and start over
04:07  Gregor: AZ2: That's true, but that's a problem for the entire field, not just JS.
04:07  Gregor: AZ2: Computer Scientists do not know how to do threads right.
04:08  AZ2: i think eventually we'll just obfuscate to MPI2 (but let's call it MPI3) and then use ASIC for common tasks - and browsers are not going to have "many common tasks" that can be done well in ASIC
04:09  NexT||eVo: so Nobody can't help me?
04:10  Gregor: NexT||eVo: Nobody knows Joomla. Maybe ask on Joomla's channel, not here.
04:11  AZ2: NexT||eVo: generally it is better to ask specific questions and not requests for help. If someone knows the answer, they can provide it - but only if they know the question and not just the topic
04:11  Gregor: AZ2: Message-passing doesn't scale, processors are too fast and their communication channels are too slow. Unless we can fix that much faster than we get more cores, we're still screwed :)
04:11  NexT||eVo: Gregor  Its not joomla only specific.. i think its JS
04:12  iateadonut: anyone happen to answer the blinking question?
04:12  AZ2: Gregor: well CELL with its bidirectional arbitrary bitwidth communication between 8 cores is pretty solid I think. Your argument holds water vs Athlon, and has a great deal of merit vs Intel
04:12  NexT||eVo: AZ2 y i know but im at an impasse
04:12  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: The last project I worked on was a cluster that did vehicle route optimization. There are some problems were a cut set function can be used to divide the problem into approximately equal parts. Anyway, it is an interesting area.
04:12  AZ2: NexT||eVo: so ask the question!
04:12  Gregor: iateadonut: Honestly that's probably what I would do, although it does seem kind of gross :)
04:13  NexT||eVo: AZ2 my question is "Where my problem?" and its bad =(
04:13  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: do you think most problems could be subdivided in the same way that problems are shown to be NP complete?
04:13  AZ2: I think your problem is communication.
04:14  NexT||eVo: AZ2 I dont have ideas what wrong with my script.
04:14  Maxdamantus: Message passing can just look like message passing.
04:14  Maxdamantus: Doesn't really have to be message passing.
04:14  Gregor: AZ2: Even with a system that can do communication well, then it just raises to a human problem (we're stupid but we KINDA get single-threaded programming :P ) ... maybe human problems are solvable though ^^
04:15  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: That is practically how they are subdivided, otherwise would not know if they are approximately equal subdivisions - as far as computability.
04:15  NexT||eVo: AZ2 so im here and ask for help
04:15  ExorcistToGo: That is an off the cuff answer.
04:15  Maxdamantus: (eg, if you passed around a reference just like a Javascript object, which's referencee is a set of references, everything is lazy, and it doesn't involve copying a load of data at one time)
04:16  ExorcistToGo: There is a function in the cut set fuction algorithm that is able to estimate computation time.
04:17  AZ2: well i'd like to write an AI debugger, and have it look up common solutions to common problems. Everything is implementation specific though, so it will be a hard AI and just Computational Intelligence. The same sort of system would be directly applicable to the much more difficult process of converting loops into work units. .Net has done some work on making it easier to designate "thread this"

04:17  AZ2: NexT||eVo: selecting between my choice of responses, I'm going to be less rude and simply block you.
04:19  NexT||eVo: AZ2 not need, i leave now
04:19  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: doing a lot of different clusters, I found that sometimes we were I/O bound disk, L2 cache bound, processor bound, cpu bound. Segmenting off CPU tasks by MIPS works in one way but not in another
04:19  ExorcistToGo: Anyway what happens is it looks for a complete set that fits into the resources available, if you have 1024 processors avail it will try to divide it into that many equal problems or less, in some cases dividing the problem up more leads to more time, etc. So it is a slightly tricky problem, but nothing that can't be solved with a little hard work.
04:20  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: were your work units of arbitrary or fixed size?
04:21  ExorcistToGo: AZ2 - fixed duration
04:21  ExorcistToGo: within some interval
04:21  iateadonut: i did it like this instead:  swi=1;
04:21  iateadonut: setInterval("if (swi == 1) { jg.setColor('yellow'); jg.fillPolygon(arrayhl01, arrayhl02); jg.setStroke(3); jg.setColor('red'); jg.drawPolygon(arrayhl01, arrayhl02); jg.paint(); swi=0; } else { jg.clear(); swi=1; }",1000);
04:22 --- mauke_ is now known as mauke
04:22  ExorcistToGo: AZ2 - It has been around 3 years now since I was involved with that. But it is an interesting area.
04:23  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: As far these optimizations are concerned they are almost all some sort of locality of reference concern.
04:23  AZ2: do you think having tasks with known duration is a small subset or a large subset of computing?
04:23  ExorcistToGo: You can factor that in for the different resources.
04:24  AZ2: right, using ramdisks and unix socket to file instead of tcp sockets were two common optimizations i did
04:24  ExorcistToGo: Good question.
04:24  AZ2: another was replace cat3 with cat6. 20% speed improvement, $15
04:25  Maxdamantus: iateadonut: jsyk, you can pass a function to setInterval, usually much nicer than a long string of code.
04:25  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: Using SSD helps alot.
04:25  Wes-: Gregor we shared-nothing DOM worker threads. That is the concurrency model of the future (on the web)
04:26  Maxdamantus: DOM should be reasonably simply to thread, for the sake of efficiency.
04:27  iateadonut: yeah, but i have to define the function based on other variables.
04:27  Maxdamantus: (It wouldn't affect the programmer)
04:27  iateadonut: thanks.
04:27  AZ2: any off the cuff answer regarding known duration tasks? I'm very curious and you studied this a lot more than i have
04:27  Gregor: Wes-: Have fun communicating by serialization and deserialization, that'll be performant on non-embarrassingly-parallel problems.
04:27  AZ2: Gregor: serialize/unserialize we can ASIC
04:28  Wes-: gregor: for starters, DOM worker threads do not require (de)serialization, and shared-nothing + message passing *IS* the future of the web
04:28  Gregor: Typing with a cat sleeping on my left arm is difficult :)
04:29  Wes-: Gregor: http://www.aminutewithbrendan.com/pages/20101108
04:29  Gregor: Wes-: (De)serialization is in the message passing, not the worker threads.
04:29  Wes-: Gregor: There are other ways to pass messages than (de)serialization
04:30  Gregor: Wes-: Sure, but by restricting sharing they're always going to be less powerful than passing arbitrary objects back and forth, so there will always be a disconnect between worker code and communication.
04:30  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: I tend to believe there is an upper bound of how long something takes in most application domains.
04:30  AZ2: erlang does message passing sexy
04:30  Wes-: Gregor: Did you click on the link?
04:31  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: In fact 99.99999999.... % of them.
04:31  Gregor: Wes-: I've heard it (or rather, read the transcript)
04:31  Wes-: Gregor: And you dismiss brendan's expierience out of hand?
04:31  Wes-: (I've generally found him to be extremely on-point, smart, and well-rounded)
04:32  Gregor: Wes-: So have I, but people have proven time and time again that we as a field are NOT prepared for concurrency. Period. I don't care how much experience you have, we won't be there for at least a decade, and we need to make more mistakes first (and hopefully learn from them :P )
04:32  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: That is of course meant as sort of a joke. But that is all I really know, is that there are expectations for problem solutions times that control this.
04:33  AZ2: i'm speaking from my experience with other languages, but isn't serialization simply a way to transport a blob of data like objects with structure intact? can't the same code be written safely passing only the necessary information?
04:33  Wes-: gregor: I think we already learned the lessons from POSIX threads: they suck, we need a better model
04:33  NuLLBiT: Can I redirect the parent window from within an inline frame (cross-domain)
04:33  Gregor: Wes-: Yes, we do need a better model. We haven't found one yet, and we're going to try a number of really shitty ones before we find one that works.
04:34  Wes-: Gregor: Sure - but are you actually arguing that we need to revisit promiscuous threads, and this time on the web? Because that's what it sounded like.
04:34  Gregor: Wes-: Good LORD no.
04:34  Gregor: Wes-: I'm just being obscenely pessimistic is all!
04:34  Wes-: Oh, okay.
04:34  Wes-: I don't have a problem with pessimism
04:35  Wes-: I have a problem with "please give us C++ threads in Javascript"
04:35  Gregor: Basically my stance on parallelism is this: We're totally screwed. We are completely, and totally screwed. Computing in general is going to crash and burn, and then we will recover.
04:35  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: I suppose if you have 98% of your work done within 5% of median, that you could just say "this is my execution time but there are exceptions" and that doesn't hurt parallelization, just increases communication or you manage your work list better
04:35  Gregor: Wes-: Yeah, that would be REALLY bad X-D
04:35  Maxdamantus: AZ2: it's the process of converting an arbitrary object into a sequence of scalar values that represent the object's contents.
04:35  Wes-: Gregor: FWIW - I haven't seen any great leaps in parallelism ... ever .. and I've been computing for a LONG time
04:35  ExorcistToGo: Pessimism is good. It creates more reliable systems.
04:35  ExorcistToGo: :)
04:36  Gregor: Wes-: That's just it; until now, we haven't been forced to. If trends continue (and we can only pray that they don't), we WILL be forced to.
04:36  Wes-: Gregor: The task switcher for the BASIC interpreter in the C64 that was published in Compute!s Gazette .. around 1986? ... is really not any different than what we have to this day
04:36  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: Exactly
04:37  AZ2: Maxdamantus: that's the process, the mechanics can be optimized depending on the data structures involved (mixed type lists/arrays vs uniform data type, etc) but at the high level, aren't you simply saying "make all of this data more portable" rather than "here is the exact data necessary" ??
04:37  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: Most of the cluster optimization software is concerned about effectively sharing the cluster resource itself, not creating responsive systems.
04:38  Maxdamantus: Sure, I guess.
04:38  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: This is changing.
04:38  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: I haven't used any high level stuff in years so I'm sure it changed a ton. haha we replied same point
04:39  AZ2: didn't Linux just get a new scheduler that improved performance drastically Wes?
04:39  Wes-: AZ2: it's still not as good as the one solaris has been shipping for a decade
04:40  Wes-: I'm talking about changes to the state of the art
04:40  Wes-: not incremental increases in implementations
04:40  Wes-: obviously my 2GHz mac performs better than my 1MHz commodore 64
04:40  AZ2: i'd love a good GNU Solaris on U-SPARC
04:40  Wes-: But it doesn't perform *differently*
04:40  ExorcistToGo: So has v8 been used for distributed computing directly in Chrome?
04:40  Wes-: AZ2: Solaris 10 + Blastwave will get you 99% of the way there
04:40  iateadonut: commodore was 1MHz?
04:41  Wes-: iateadonut: C64 was. C128 was 2MHz
04:42  ExorcistToGo: I should have asked this. Has V8 been used in distributed computing?
04:42  alcuadrado: ExorcistToGo, yes
04:42  AZ2: well the thing i couldn't stand at all was the override directory that broke. I couldn't stand the package management even under solaris 8 and i had to support SunOS 2.5 to Solaris 8. I liked the Gnome adoption, they finally admitted how terrible they were doing. What I want is basically debian with a solaris kernel
04:43  alcuadrado: it was even used for that in chrome itself
04:43  ExorcistToGo: amazing
04:43  alcuadrado: I think it was for an entry to nodeknockout
04:43  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: I'm still thinking about your points
04:44  Wes-: AZ2: OpenSolaris was getting there, some other OpenSolaris distros had ~ that goal. Belenix, maybe?
04:45  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: What is interesting is how computer systems are designed themselves. Do you know about DSP systolic arrays?
04:46  AZ2: ExorcistToGo: no i don't, i never did any signals processing but I did read about reversible computing and tried a few things
04:47  AZ2: I also relearnd processor architecture every 6-9 months
04:47  AZ2: if we could do branch prediction shared between processors, that would be sexy
04:48  AZ2: then you just group your data by similarity and run it that way...
04:50  AZ2: i also looked hard at putting the number field sieve (stage2) on the Cell processors... that was a serious topic :)
04:54  AZ2: Hmmm I think the pentultimate clustering software (which will eventually be a desktop app as well) will break up jobs based on how they are resource bound, try to utilize all segregated parts of the computer at once (like scsi prefetch during idle), determine when approximations are permitted, share only relevant pieces of data (not leaving it up to the programmer), optimize via CODA and other ASIC automatically, and share time be
04:54  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: Image processing and solving PDEs is really a small subset of the computing done on the desktop :)
04:55  AZ2: CODA is being used to crack WIFI passwords.
04:55  ExorcistToGo: Yeah but WIFI passwords are an easy crack.
04:56  ExorcistToGo: heh
04:56  ExorcistToGo: I have nothing to do with that area, and stay far far away.
04:56  AZ2: WEP no point in doing CODA. WPA, CODA. WPA2 ... you like beating yourself against crypto? it will be easier to attack the driver...
04:56  m0: beh I spend all this time trying to figure out if I can read variables defined by the webpage content script, and just realized it is not allowed due to security. Night time wasted :(
04:57  AZ2: m0: umm
04:58  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: I am looking forward to the first large scale quantum computer made using Two-Photon 3D microfabrication techniques.
04:59  AZ2: do you think they will go beyond Shor's algo?
05:00  AZ2: the Shor's on niobium is pretty cool, but the real question is if we can do better than sorting phone books and do an NP hard problem in quantum computing

05:22 --- qhoxie_ is now known as qhoxie
05:30  ExorcistToGo: AZ2: I don't think Quantum Computing will provide the magic bullet here. It is just an upgrade, but it is a significant upgrade. For example an old physics problem was to calculate the Fermi temperature of say copper, it was for all practical purposes transcomputable until renormalization group theory could be applied to the problem.
05:30  ExorcistToGo: Better example would be Fe, sorry. Heh
05:35  AZ2: well i think that QC is a magic bullet for hard math if they can do NP hard problems, and that's the next algorithm after Shor
05:54  Lurzino: Hello everyone!!! :-)))))) I need a little help on my little weird issue: I have a site on http://www.vacanze-viaggi.eu, when clicking on "Chi siamo" it should be expected a substitution of div with the help of $(".square").replaceWith(divblock); but it doesn't do that; indeed locally on my usb pen with XAMPP it works... why?
05:58  DanInMass: well you appears to be getting 4 not found errors on some gif as well
05:58  Lurzino: I mean, that link is <li><a href="" id="about">Chi siamo</a></li> which is managed from a js file that contains: $("#about").click(function() { divblock = '<h2><br>Chi siamo</h2>....'; $(".square").replaceWith(divblock); }
06:01  Lurzino: any suggest?
06:02  Lurzino: maybe that menu item shouldn't be an <a href> to use div substitution ?
06:05  DanInMass: I couldnt find any div with a class of .square in your html is it added at some point wiht javascript?
06:05  DanInMass: Oh also your getting 2 javascript syntax errors on page load
06:06  Lurzino: hold on DanInMass...
06:08  Lurzino: hmmm maybe myEl = document.getElementById('square'); should be with # ?
06:09  gkatsev: no
06:09  gkatsev: no #
06:09  Lurzino: ok
06:14  DanInMass: Lurzino. I do not see in your code where there is any element in your html with a class, name or id of square. by your example of $(".square").replaceWith(divblock) I would assume its an element with a class of "square
06:14  Lurzino: DanInMass... I right corrected .square removing the .
06:14  Lurzino: it's a div with id="square"
06:14  DanInMass: unless im missing something your first need an element with a class of .square somewhere on your page before yu can replace it with anything
06:15  DanInMass: ok then it should be #square in that example
06:15  Lurzino: <div id="square"><p class="square">
06:16  DanInMass: also, jsut ot be clear, are you sure you want to basically remove the entire div #square and replace it wiht an H@ element?
06:16  DanInMass: H element
06:17  Silviyius: I need help to tie my shoes is this the right room :P
06:17  DanInMass: heh.. no
06:17  jeremyw: Loop, swoop and pull.
06:17  DanInMass: there was a fella in #css earlier that had never used ic before.. that was fun
06:17  DanInMass: irc
06:17  Silviyius: lol
06:17 * jeremyw was just typing "What is ic?"
06:18  Silviyius: he meant irc
06:18  Silviyius: typo
06:18  Silviyius: i think
06:18  Silviyius: haha
06:18  jeremyw: I know that now but I was confused already and was ready to figure out what I had been missing out on.
06:19  Lurzino: DanInMass, no not an entire DIV but the internal paragraph
06:19  DanInMass: lurzino.. i still dont see any instance of a div wiht an id of square my freind
06:19  Lurzino: I changed .square with .squareblock
06:19  DanInMass: ok so you are targeting a div wiht a class of squareblock?
06:20  Lurzino: no, it's a <div id="square"> <p class="squareblock"> ..... </p></div>
06:21  Lurzino: if you refresh the page clearing cache and showing source you'll find squareblock....
06:23  DanInMass: Lurzino. If you look at the html code inbetween<body and </body> there is no <p class="squareblock">  - fols am i missing something
06:23  DanInMass: folks
06:23  Lurzino: ah... it's still in header part
06:24  zowtar: guys, I was an user of Highslide to zoom my website photos, but now I'm using a new php framework (cakephp), and it's not working anymore, the question is: anyone knows a similar js code that works in cakephp?
06:24  Lurzino: but the header part starts after body
06:24 --- emma is now known as em
06:26  DanInMass: I just copied all of your code and searched it twice. no squareblock
06:27  Lurzino: hmmm I have FF open with source window and finding I see squareblock
06:27  cyberjorge: hi, how do I call this.. http://pastebin.com/bsWbZdkw when the page opens?
06:28  buubot: cyberjorge:  The 1 line paste bsWbZdkw has been copied to http://nopaste.snit.ch/26331  .
06:28  DanInMass: in your javascript code, yes. but not in the body of your HTML
06:29  Lurzino: DanInMass...did you cleared the cache?
06:29  DanInMass: yup
06:29  Lurzino: weird... I right now tried also with IE6
06:29  Pilum: cyberjorge: Showing the PHP code is pointless. Show us the output (that the browser sees).
06:29  Lurzino: and I see squareblock in html code
06:30  DanInMass: ok there we go
06:30  cyberjorge: Pilum: this is the page.. http://justiceforlifelinedirector.com/results.php
06:31  cyberjorge: Pilum: the "Last" button should activate/click when the page loads.
06:32  Pilum: So not a button after all, but a link.
06:32  Lurzino: but the weird thing is when I click on "Chi siamo" menu, it doesnt' replace the block but reloads the page...
06:32  DanInMass: it relaods the page becuase thats the url assigned to the a link
06:32  Lurzino: maybe that menuitem shouldn't have an a href?
06:32  Pilum: You'll have to obtain its reference and call .click() on it then.
06:32  cyberjorge: if that's the correct term, yes
06:33  DanInMass: ive tried loading your viaggivacanze.js and every time it .. well kind of look like one big blob, and you have commenete dout alot of the code with //
06:33  DanInMass: so its possible your desired click function is being ignored completely
06:33  DanInMass: commented out alot of the code
06:33  Pilum: Via document.links possibly, or element.getElementsByTagName I reckon, and then find the right link.
06:33  DanInMass: sorry
06:34  cyberjorge: i'm very sorry Pilum but do you have a link where I can follow an example?
06:34  DanInMass: Lurzino, when you put // in a line of javascript your telling it to ignore the rest of the text in that line, so maybe thats whats happening
06:35  Pilum: I'm afraid not. And now I really need to go lest I get late for work.
06:35  Pilum: `dom ref getElementsByTagName
06:35  jsBot: dom ref getElementsByTagName: See: document.getElementsByTagName, element.getElementsByTagName
06:35  Pilum: `dom ref element.getElementsByTagName
06:35  jsBot: dom ref element.getElementsByTagName: Returns a list of elements with the given tag name. (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:document.getElementsByTagName & http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:element.getElementsByTagName)
06:35  Pilum: ^ docs
06:35 * Pilum is gone.
06:35  cyberjorge: I can use this, thanks Pilum
06:35  Lurzino: ok DanInMass
06:35  Lurzino: Lemme try to remove completely those //
06:36  DanInMass: also
06:36  DanInMass: do you have firebug installed in firefox/
06:37  Lurzino: ah ok... now it works
06:37  Lurzino: thanks dabear
06:37  Lurzino: ops, DanInMass
06:37  DanInMass: awesome
06:37  Lurzino: didn't know // would ignore all the rest... I thought // would just ignore only that line
06:37  Lurzino: as like as it's a comment line
06:38  Lurzino: ah!
06:38  DanInMass: yeah
06:38  Lurzino: now I understand why
06:38  DanInMass: do you have firebug installed lurzino?
06:38  Lurzino: looking on browser the code of viaggivacanze.js it appears all as only one long line... you're right... and I'm a dumb hehe
06:39  Lurzino: anyway no I don't have firebug installed
06:39  Lurzino: I might go install it
06:39  Lurzino: right now
06:39  Lurzino: :)
06:39  DanInMass: that should be the next thing you do today
06:39  Lurzino: I'm doing it right now ;)
06:40  DanInMass: i would advise you install it, look in the error panel and fix the 2 syntax errors that are showing and run the code through a javascript beautifier to organize it
06:40  DanInMass: then remove anything your not actually using now that thigns are working
06:41  Lurzino: ok :)
06:41  Lurzino: javascript beautifier?
06:42  DanInMass: http://www.javascriptbeautifier.com/  cmon man :)
06:42  Lurzino: ah didn't know that :) thanks DanInMass
06:42  DanInMass: once you fix you syntax errors paste your js code in there and hit beautify
06:42  DanInMass: it will make it much easier to read
06:43  DanInMass: what are you using to edit your javascript?
06:43  crescendo: O great javascript masters, is there any way to access the actual <html> tag as a DOM element and/or modify its styles /after/ pageload?
06:43 * Lurzino hands hot chocolate cup to DanInMass to thank him for the help :-)
06:43  Lurzino: DanInMass..... notepad++
06:43  DanInMass: does it have a syntax highlighting plugin installed?
06:44  Lurzino: hmmm I don't think... I just use the editor :)
06:44  AZ2: i use scite for everything
06:45  DanInMass: I like edit pad pro. or lite
06:45  AZ2: C, AS3, Python, JS, HTML, PHP... works on every OS
06:45  preaction: crescendo: why do you need to? isn't body good enough?
06:45  alishah: Hi I am including an external javascript file in my web page. Is there any way i can get the absolute path to that external script file using javascript?
06:45  DanInMass: the I like the colors they use for highlighting ;)
06:46  DanInMass: green is for comments. most of your code was green lurzino ;)
06:46  crescendo: preaction, sadly not.  We need to be overflow-y: hidden until a certain event happens on the page (after which we're overflow-y: scroll;)
06:46  AZ2: editpad pro looks great for docking stuff, but it doesn't support code collapsing, no way i could use it
06:47  preaction: crescendo: document.documentElement maybe?
06:47  DanInMass: I rarely work on anything large myself.
06:48  DanInMass: when I do it's usuaully in DW and i jsut use editpad to help point out the kinks when i royally screw up the syntax
06:48  AZ2: well even on small stuff, I'm addicted to looking at <style> i'm tweaking at the same time I'm looking at what i'm tweaking
06:48  crescendo: preaction, amazing. Via the console, that's appearing to work. You rock.
06:50  Lurzino: ok DanInMass then I'll get the plugin for notepad++ :)
06:50  Lurzino: thanks again man :)
06:50  AZ2: i'll be working on lists, i tell scite that it's a python document, all of the lists become collapsable
06:51  AZ2: i wish it did syntax highlighting of all functions from all the languages i'm coding in, but it does a lot
06:59  bl^ckh0le: hello
06:59  bl^ckh0le: how do you get and set a hidden tag named "to" inside of a tag named "action"?
06:59  bl^ckh0le: HTML tag, btw
07:01  Lurzino: gotta go... thanks again DanInMass and hope you appreciated my virtual chocolate cup (since it's cold season) for the help ;-)
07:02  Cork: bl^ckh0le: as far as i know, there isn't any members to the action field
07:02  bl^ckh0le: gah
07:02  Cork: what is it your trying to do?
07:03  bl^ckh0le: <form action="/missions/basic/5/level5.php" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="to" value="webmaster@hulla-balloo.com" />

07:04  bl^ckh0le: field
07:04  bl^ckh0le: that is all
07:04  Cork: bl^ckh0le: what is this field your talking about?
07:04  Cork: bl^ckh0le: do you have a html example?
07:05  Cork: or js or what ever
07:05  bl^ckh0le: Cork: that is the HTML example
07:05  bl^ckh0le: form action=...
07:06  Cork: bl^ckh0le: oh sorry, i missed that line
07:06  bl^ckh0le: it is an HTML form
07:07  Cork: bl^ckh0le: if getElementById('my-form').to.value = 'new value';
07:08  Cork: (thought you talked about an attribute on the form ^^''
07:08  Cork: )
07:09  bl^ckh0le: Cork: JS Error: undefined
07:09  ideea: use jquery :<
07:09  bl^ckh0le: nooo....
07:09  bl^ckh0le: I need that to work on any page
07:10  Disorganized: hey people, does anyone know of an example countdown timer that includes milliseconds? I found a clock that includes milliseconds, but can't seem to find a countdown with it.
07:10  ideea: $("myform").attr("name","new_value");
07:10  Cork: ideea: its an input field not an attr
07:11  Cork: bl^ckh0le: looks like to is reserved on the form element

I need to javascript option to prompt for a password, while the page is loading,  there are some that work on dom complete, but that is rather late.  "prompt" does it the best, but since MS disabled that feature in IE, it has rendered it useless.. anyone have a good option for a pw prompt
09:28  cojack: xavierk: maybe you look for apache .htaccess auth?
09:29  xavierk: it isn't file/folder based, it is all virtual
09:30  cojack: ie disabled prompt?
09:30  cojack: can't be
09:30  xavierk: well, requires the user to modify their security settings to allow it
09:30  cojack: wich one of the ie?
09:30  xavierk: been that way since ie7
09:30  cojack: wait a second

10:03  sasori: question: how to make a page redirect once the "ok" button is clicked from the simple alert box e.g "Thanks for joining"  ?
10:04  xavierk: sasori:        if ( confirm(msg) ) {
10:04  mushkin: does this reg exp find acronyms only? /[A-Z]{3}/i
10:05  xavierk: sasori, nvm
10:05  sasori: argh..please continue :|
10:05  sasori: let's say for example i ahve this alert("thanks for joining");
10:05  xavierk: sasori, confirm, is a confirm dialog
10:06  sasori: what about that (msg)  ?
10:06  sasori: is that a variable ? i didn't set any variable at all
10:06  Flannel: mushkin: three letter acronyms, yeah.
10:06  xavierk: var msg = "Are you sure you want to delete this?";
10:06  mushkin: flannel, its picking up every 3 letters
10:06  mushkin: lowercase or not
10:06  Flannel: mushkin: right.  It picks up every three letters in a row, regardless of case.
10:07  sasori: what if it's just a plain alert box and not a confirm box , is there anyway to redirect after clicking the lone "ok" button inside that pop up alert box ?
10:07  mushkin: I need capital only
10:07  Flannel: mushkin: remove the 'i' at the end
10:08  xavierk: sasori, just put the redirect on the next line
10:08  xavierk: it'll redirect automatically after they press ok
10:08  sasori: code snippet please ...(sorry noob here )
10:11  xavierk: sasori: alert("thank you"); documents.location = "bla.html";
10:11  sasori: ok thanks :) +rep for ya
10:13  ruby_on_tails: hi
10:14  ruby_on_tails: i have a php script and as it runs i want some JS to trigger, like there are 4 checks, after each check some JS should trigger how can i do this ?
10:17  vovvawork: ruby_on_tails: then you have to make php print the JS code...
10:17  ruby_on_tails: hmm
10:18  ruby_on_tails: if i have a php script that takes 20 seconds to load completely and 4 js code are echoed at 5 seconds interval will they work ?

10:37  TheSheep: ispirto: parsing html with regular expressions will get you nowhere
10:38  ispirto: TheSheep, what do you mean
10:41  TheSheep: ispirto: html is context-free, regular expressions are regular, they are too weak to parse html
10:41  ispirto: TheSheep, i know, but this particular html code won't change ever, and i'll use my script for opera
10:42  ispirto: there is a ad code with that metarefresh, i want to bypass it
10:42  TheSheep: they always say that
10:49  ispirto: document.getElementById('metaredirect').content.replace('9;url=', '');
10:49  ispirto: this worked actually

11:52  js_: if i post to an iframe, how can i determine that the post is finished? tried onload and onreadystatechanged, but they don't seem to work

11:52  blip-:  is there any hope they will create one soon, main reason I can't use javascript is because I need to read a text from the client side and send that to be transliterated

12:19  MrNibbles: hey guys, anyone about?
12:19  MrNibbles: trying to do something really simple, and its not working out how i have invisioned it
12:19  MrNibbles: https://gist.github.com/6564873c86212ef316bf
12:19  MrNibbles: setting up a little event object
12:20  MrNibbles: which tries to access properties on every call that relate to the current time
12:20  MrNibbles: and calls the function within if that object exists

12:26  fruight: hi, i'm coding a little simulation-game and i need some help with the overall architecture. i had it roughly working as a big anonymous function, but i read a bit into js oop and i decided to refactor it as a big constructor. i managed to do that, but the main loop was done using window.setTimeout(loop,1000/fps); and if i do that now (loop is in the prototype of my constructor) it fails, cause it calls it with this=window instea
12:26  MrNibbles: molgrew: second link contains a better example
12:27  fruight: i even tried keeping a reference to the object and passing it to the loop with (window.setTimeout(function(){loop(me)},1000/fps) so it would get sent through a closure, but even that fails and i dont really understand why

12:32  MrNibbles: because its set correctly in the code im running, timer is used for a lot more than just event triggering

12:35  MrNibbles: :(
12:35  MrNibbles: must be something else in the codebase
12:35  MrNibbles: ... i should really test these things
12:37  MrNibbles: thought my event triggering was quite a neat idea though ;)
12:37  MrNibbles: beats checking through an array each loop
12:41  fruight: could somebody please take a look at this snippet and suggest a better way to implement the loop? http://pastie.org/1338024
12:43  fruight: 'this' is always confusing me...
12:43  MrNibbles: fruight:  you can use window.setInterval to achieve the same as both of those loops combined
12:43  MrNibbles: in fact, you dont even need window as it is implied
12:44  fruight: MrNibbles: my problem is, that i cant reach the local variables of foo from inside loop
12:44  fruight: in start() it works because i call it as "foo.start()", but loop() gets called by the timeout, so 'this' is window instead of 'foo'
12:45 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
12:45  MrNibbles: you can use either .call() or .apply() to change 'this'
12:45  MrNibbles: but i would suggest using setTimeout
12:46  MrNibbles: and refactoring that code
12:47  MrNibbles: setInterval sorry
12:49  fruight: this is what i refactored it into :P before it was just an anonymous function, like "(loop=function(){setTimeout(loop,1000/fps)/*stuff*/})()" but i wanted to make it a bit more semantic :P

14:30  cheney: i am looking for a fast server side JavaScript interpreter that can take a file/function reference as input and return output to the command line
14:31  cheney: i know rhino does this but I am hoping for something more modern based on V8 or tracemonkey
14:31  cheney: what would be a good solution?
14:32  cheney: i am not looking for craziness like a web server, database, network traffic relay, or any other craziness
14:32  cheney: i just need something that interprets JS on a command line
14:32  Sorella: cheney ≣ Node.js is a framework for web servers on top of v8
14:32  Sorella: rhino is slow as fuck
14:33  cheney: I have node.js installed right now and I don't think its what I need
14:33  Sorella: you can download Node.js and use it from the command line, without spawning a server: node tests.js
14:33  cheney: its like a web server in a box rather than a function interpreter
14:33  Sorella: (which is what I use to run test cases)
14:34  Sorella: No, you can use it without the server part
14:34  cheney: ah ok
14:34  cheney: it could be that I am just too stupid to get how to execute node for my needs
14:35  cheney: would I put my function into the tests.js file
14:35  Sorella: you just run `node` and give the javascript files you want to execute as CLI arguments.
14:36  Sorella: node test.js //would execute test.js using v8 shell
14:36  cheney: what if i want to execute a named function with the same name as the containing file
14:36  cheney: would I just run     node ./prettydiff.js
14:37  gz0_: Im trying to dynamically create object properties... http://pastie.org/1338252 can someone help me out
14:38  Sorella: cheney ≣ I don't think you can specify an arbitrary function in the file. It will execute the entire file, you just have to call your function from that file.
14:39  cheney: gz0_: why must someNames be a property of dynamic?
14:40  cheney: gz0_: you need to define someNames as a property of dynamic, such as         var dynamic = {someNames:""};
14:41  cheney: Sorella: then how would I pass arguments, and some other method of input, into the executing file?
14:43  gz0_: cheney: I needed dynamic[someNames[i]] instead of dynamic.someNames[i], someone in jquery pointed that out and it worked
14:43  cheney: gz0_: also, use http://prettydiff.com/?pastebin to submit to pastebin, because then your stuff is auto-beautified
14:43  gz0_: cheney: good advice will do
14:43  gz0_: cheney: also thx for the reply, i see what your saying, that would work too cool
14:44  cheney: you just need to instantiate the property name and then you can assign to it

16:10  morrissey: i have some simple issues with jscript
16:10  morrissey: i want to validate this
16:10  morrissey: http://www.opweb.gr/index.php?view=register
16:14  morrissey: is this correct ?
16:18  joo: morrissey, JScript is not exactly the same as Javascript
16:18  joo: JScript is a shell scripting language by Microsoft
16:18  morrissey: sorry i was just make it in short
16:18  joo: Say "JS" instead
16:18  morrissey: im talking about javascript
16:19  elb0w: JScript is microsofts version of javascript for IE no?
16:19  morrissey: http://pastebin.com/HEqXFVdE
16:19  elb0w: yeah it is
16:19  buubot: morrissey:  The 1 line paste HEqXFVdE has been copied to http://nopaste.snit.ch/26364  .
16:19  pigdude: elb0w: yep
16:19  joo: elb0w, well the JScript I know has several limitations which aren't present in IE
16:19  pigdude: joo: what IE uses is still JScript, you can see in the debugger
16:20  pigdude: joo: it uses that term
16:20  joo: Hmm...
16:20  joo: Well perhaps there are different versions of JScript
16:20  pigdude: joo: let me put it  this way: MS is only distributing one ecma script engine, realistically
16:20  elb0w: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript
16:20  pigdude: joo: if it is restricted in an env is another matter
16:21  joo: Oh, I see.
16:21  joo: Well, my misconception then.
16:21  pigdude: granted i'm no expert on this
16:21  pigdude: but that has been my impression
16:21  elb0w: no you are correct
16:22  elb0w: The book I read pretty much said what you did
16:22  pigdude: which book?
16:22  elb0w: some javascript + ajax book
16:23  joo: morrissey, I'm not sure what the issue is.
16:23  elb0w: it was a crash course
16:23  morrissey: 1 miniute to paste the js
16:23  pigdude: elb0w: SAMS teach yourself in 2 shits
16:23  joo: If you expect me to look through your whole code to find bugs, I'm not going to do that.
16:23  elb0w: lol
16:23  morrissey: no
16:23  joo: But is there a specific problem?
16:23  morrissey: there is
16:23  elb0w: I didnt really need it, my main problem was the differences between the browsers
16:23  elb0w: but now I write pretty much mainly jquery
16:23  elb0w: and they handle most of that
16:24  elb0w: only issue ive had was with embeded flash objects getting destroyed in some browsers with display:none

16:31  gkatsev: when I was using SML, it was great
16:31  FireFly: superlinux, I think there's a scrollTo method for element objects
16:31  gkatsev: and was pretty sweet in Scala as well
16:31  superlinux: mmmm

16:31  superlinux: i'll check that
16:31  v8bot: gkatsev: window.scrollTo - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.scrollTo
16:32  FireFly: I just noticed a piece of code where I do (roughly) if (a == 0) { return b == 0 ? foo : bar } else if (a == 1) {return b == 0 ? baz : blah}
16:32  superlinux: gkatsev, is't compatible with I.E?
16:32  FireFly: Would've been awesome to simply pattern match all four cases
16:33  gkatsev: FireFly: haha, yeah, pattern matching ftw
16:35  gkatsev: superlinux: there is also scrollIntoView which is on the element itself

16:38  atxq: and what if setTimeout is set to different times on each one?
16:38  atxq: for now 1 sec. would be fine, but I want to set it up so that if I need that flexibility, that it is implemented already
16:39  gkatsev: then you want 2 setTimeouts
16:40  atxq: will two functions with different setTimeout be possible than?
16:41  gkatsev: setTimeout(foo, 500); setTimeout(bar, 1000);

17:04  granden: Hi
17:05  gkatsev: frio80: :)
17:05  granden: Is it possible to give a parameter to a .js file? To set a variable in the javascript file?
17:05  granden: I got a index number I want to be able to change, when loading the js file.
17:05  Pilum: Not really.
17:05  granden: But dunno how to do that.
17:05  Pilum: JS files are loaded to become part of the document's JS. It doesn't exist as a seperate entity.
17:06  Pilum: If you want to set parameters you'll need to handle it via some serverside scripting.
17:06  gkatsev: unless you wrap it in a huge function and modulerize it.
17:06  granden: Pilum: Okej, so if I got for example index.php and gallery.js
17:06  granden: and in index.php have a <script> js-code goes here to set i to 3</script>
17:06  granden: and later loads the js file
17:06  granden: with script
17:06  granden: the js-script could use that variable?
17:07  Pilum: gkatsev: It'd still be part of the page's JS "block" :-)
17:07  Munter: granden: yes
17:07  granden: Cool, thanks, then I think I know how to solve it.
17:07  gkatsev: Pilum: yes, but you could new that module and pass it some variables or w/e.
17:15  superlinux: gkatsev, I used the methods. they are scrolling. but not scrolling in where the view has to be in the center of the window
17:16  superlinux: i used the scrollIntoView
17:17  gkatsev: it's scrolling it to the top of the window?
17:23  granden: Another question, if I got <script> code goes here </script> Could I use server-side scripting inside the <script>-tags. Like <script>js-code goes <?php $_GET["index"]; ?> here and continues on</script>
17:23  granden: ?
17:24  NoiseEee: granden: if you're asking if you can set variables using PHP the same way you set any dynamic content with PHP, the answer is yet
17:24  kicken: You can use server-side stuff anywhere
17:24  NoiseEee: yes
17:24  gkatsev: you can use server-side scripting whereever you want
17:24  kicken: but it won't be affected by JS conditions
17:24  kicken: eg, onclick
17:24  gkatsev: no, because they are all set before the js is executed
17:25  granden: I want to set a js-variable using php
17:25  rationalOgre: Greetings, folks. Learning about JavaScript via Crockford.com wending my way through http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html I come across a term I've not seen previously. In the section labeled "Constructor" about 3/4 of the way down the page, final sentence "The constructed object will contain a secret prototype link field, which contains a reference to the constructor's prototype member." What's a "link field"
17:25  rationalOgre: ?
17:25  rationalOgre: Googling thus far has turned up nothing.
17:25  Munter: rationalOgre: Sound like a simple property
17:26  rationalOgre: Munter: That's what I was thinking but was not certain of. Thank you for your input. :)
17:26  Munter: At least that is pretty much the way you can manipulate with it. Nothing secret or special there
17:26  gkatsev: `eloquent @ rationalOgre // is slightly better a learning js from
17:26  jsBot: rationalOgre: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
17:27  Munter: That book is not worth half of what Crockfords talsk are
17:28  Cryp71c: I have 4 inputs that I'm adding together to form a sum, but when I do parseInt() + parseInt() + parseInt() + parseint() if I put in a value for all 4 (say I do 1,2,3,4) I get the sum (10) but if I put in (5) and skip the others (leaving them blank), I get 5000 (5 + 0 + 0 + 0)

17:29  Maxdamantus: Cryp71c: that shouldn't happen for parseint.
17:29  istevenmon: Munter: so how would be the approach ?
17:29  Munter: gkatsev: rationalOgre didn't sound like a beginner to me
17:29  Cryp71c: Maxdamantus, I'm using jquery, but only to get the values of the fields, which shouldn't be impacting the scenario, should it?
17:30  rationalOgre: gkatsev: Well, I'm not exactly a beginner. I'm fairly well versed in Python. And once upon a time I used to work in JS/ASP. *shudder*
17:30  Cryp71c: Maxdamantus, intval($('#order_phs_num').val())+intval($('#order_phr_num').val())+intval($('#order_wfa_num').val())+intval($('#order_phep_num').val())
17:30  rationalOgre: I just wanted a better understanding of things.
17:30  Maxdamantus: intval?
17:30  Cryp71c: er,wait. Nvm. I have leftovers from an old funtion I was messing with
17:30  Cryp71c: I didn't change them on all 4 onkeyup actions.
17:30  Cryp71c: nvm
17:30  gkatsev: by beginner I mean specifically js beginner, but a total beginner in programming as well also fits
17:31 * rationalOgre still has nightmares about JS/ASP...
17:32  Munter: Noone having experience with any other programming language should have to waste time reading programming for beginners, this time with javascript and using all the stupid things like alert and innerHTML. And OO? Who cares...
17:32  gkatsev: lol
17:32  Maxdamantus: Depends what other programming languages they know.
17:33  Munter: True. If they 'know' php I would recommend them to start all over
17:33  rationalOgre: Munter: hahaha
17:33  Munter: I still consider that a script library more than a programming language though
17:33  Maxdamantus: Or if they only did Fortran at university.

17:37  Munter: If I knew I would probably have started my own business ;)
17:37  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Business Plan Faieries. Notoriously difficult to catch...
17:37  rationalOgre: *faeries
17:38  Maxdamantus: færies?
17:38  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Something like that. :)
17:39  frio80: Off topic but who is in #javascript?  Is that for jsmentors only or something? :)
17:39  gkatsev: #javascript? does that exist?
17:39  frio80: It says 'invite only'
17:40  gkatsev: on freenode?
17:40  Maxdamantus: If it did, it'd probably be owned by Mozilla.
17:40  frio80: gkatsev: yes
17:40  gkatsev: oh, hm...
17:40  Maxdamantus: Mozilla has their own network though, so they don't use this too much.
17:40  kicken: It used to just forward here I thought
17:40  Maxdamantus: It will forward there, probably.
17:41  gkatsev: It used to forward here because of how freenode works, but if #freenode exists as a channel, it wont
17:42  Maxdamantus: Actually, dunno if Mozilla would be able to get #javascript
17:42  rationalOgre: ah, I understand "link field" now. He's using Field in the OO sense. (data encapsulated within an object/class)
17:42  Maxdamantus: Seeing as it's usually now used to refer to all implementations of ECMAScript, rather than just Mozilla's implementation.
17:42  istevenmon: can i use obj.style.height = heightmax + 'px'; obj.style.overflow-x: hidden; obj.style.overflow-y:auto; ?
17:43  Maxdamantus: That's an invalid lable name.
17:43  Maxdamantus: obj.style.overflow-x
17:43  Munter: rationalOgre: Yup. In Js terminology it would just be an object property. The only thing special about it is that the engine uses that property for something
17:44  Maxdamantus: js> obj.style.overflow-x: hidden;
17:44  gbot2: Maxdamantus: Error: SyntaxError: invalid label:  obj.style.overflow-x: hidden;  ...................^
17:44  istevenmon: Maxdamantus: i want to show the scroller in the Y axis
17:44  rationalOgre: Munter: Got it. :)
17:44  frio80: Maybe David Mark sits all alone in #javascript
17:44  Maxdamantus: It'll translate as a JS property to overflowX
17:45  rationalOgre: Munter: Reading this page has actually been very enlightening. When I finally grokked that every object is just a collection of name:value pairs a lightbulb went on.
17:45 * rationalOgre is slow sometimes...
17:46  gkatsev: rationalOgre: yeah, very similar to python dictionaries.
17:46  istevenmon: Maxdamantus: could explain it with an example please?
17:46  rationalOgre: gkatsev: Indeed.
17:46  Maxdamantus: obj.style.overflowX = "hidden";
17:47  istevenmon: thanks
17:48  istevenmon: js> obj.style.marginTop = '10px';
17:48  gbot2: istevenmon: Error: ReferenceError: obj is not defined
17:48  asdfqwer: OT, but did google remove CSS/HTML edits features from google/docs?
17:48  thansen: I've got an onKeyPress event defined for an input box that only allows numbers (and decimal)
17:48  Maxdamantus: This Crockford survey of Javascript is quite awkward.
17:49  Maxdamantus: "Everything else is variations on the object type."
17:49  Maxdamantus: "Escapement is done with the \ character,"
17:49 * Maxdamantus wiktionary's escapement.
17:49  frio80: istevenmon: You know, you can just do: obj.style.cssText = 'overflow-x:hidden;overfloy-y:auto'
17:49  thansen: now I'm trying to add the ability to accept a negative sign as the first char..how can detect that the inputted value *would be* the first character?
17:49  istevenmon: frio80: didnt know that thanks a lot
17:49  Maxdamantus: Heh, yeah, that does make sense, but that's a noun.
17:50  NoiseEee: thansen: that kind of thing is just really annoying about 99% of the time.  adjust/alter/flag the bad data after the focus on the field is gone, not on keypresses
17:51  Maxdamantus: Actually, that does make sense, nvm.
17:51  thansen: I don't really want to do that since the values input will be manipulated added etc on change already
17:51  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: :)
17:51  Maxdamantus: I'm not so sure about the other thing though.
17:51  Maxdamantus: Everything else is a variation of the object type.
17:52  Maxdamantus: I think it might be an AmE thing actually.
17:52  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: AmE?
17:52  Maxdamantus: American English.
17:52  Maxdamantus: They have funny uses of "is".
17:52  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: such as?
17:52  NoiseEee: thansen: then you're going to have to adjust your function to get the value of the text field and find out where the - is really
17:52  Maxdamantus: "Everything else is variations on the object type."
17:53  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Ah, never heard it referred to as AmE before. learn tons of new things every day. :)
17:53  thansen: NoiseEee: but the value doesn't yet have the - in there...that's my issue :(
17:55  thansen: the code I have checks to see if the field.value.length ==0 then it allows it
17:55  NoiseEee: thansen: then keyup, not keypress
17:55  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Can be restated as "All other values are variations of the Object type."
17:55  rationalOgre: If my understanding is accurate.
17:55  Maxdamantus: 05:51:49 < Maxdamantus> Everything else is a variation of the object type.
17:55  thansen: the issue that I'm hitting now is when it gets focused and someone just starts typing
17:55  thansen: NoiseEee: ok, I'll look at key up
17:56  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: that doesn't seem right. Everything is singular so is is correct but variations shouldn't be plural.
17:56  thansen: thanks
17:56  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Right. I guess I'm struggling to understand what you are pointing out when saying "I'm not so sure about the other thing though."
17:56  Maxdamantus: gkatsev: yeah, that's what I meant.
17:56  Maxdamantus: Trying to find it on Wikipedia.
17:56  Maxdamantus: grepping for "is" isn't helpful :(
17:56  soulknife: hey when i hover over some text i would like a smaller window to appear with clickable hyperlinks, so anchors
17:57  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: so that sentence is wrong
17:57  Maxdamantus: Oh.
17:57  soulknife: how does one go about that?
17:57  Maxdamantus: But I'm sure I've heard something about use of "is" like that in AmE.
17:58  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: it should be something like 'everything else is a variation of the object type' to be fully gramatically correct.
17:58  Maxdamantus: Yep, exactly what I said.
17:58  Maxdamantus: I know I have seen some difference with "is" before though.
17:59  Maxdamantus: It was mentioned in some Larry Wall presentation I watched (on YT) about Perl 5 .. or 6.. whatever's the latest one.
17:59  SolarBoom: hey
18:00  Wizek: What is the easyest way to delete variable objects based off a string? Like, I have a string: "foo-baz-bar", that means, I want to delete obj.foo.baz.bar .
18:00  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: oh, ok, i see. I only saw your quote "11:52:41 < Maxdamantus> "Everything else is variations on the object type.""
18:01  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: so, no, it isn't an American thing. It's just wrong. The difference between American and British is pants=trousers and cigarettes=fags and color=colour. Grammar wise, should be pretty much the same.
18:01  Maxdamantus: No, there's quite a bit of grammatical difference too.
18:02  Maxdamantus: "Perl6 is many languages, or if you're British, Perl6 are many languages" O_o
18:03  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=define:is < final definition on that page. Is that what you are referring to?
18:03  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: ok, I see. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_differences#Grammar
18:04  Maxdamantus: Interesting about the "just" thing.
18:04  Maxdamantus: I often use "just" like that.
18:04  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: In BrE the noun depends on what it is made up of, in AmE it depends on whether the noun itself is plural or singular
18:04  Maxdamantus: Wait, maybe in the first example, "Cable broadband just got faster".
18:04  Maxdamantus: But not in the other examples, that just seems weird.
18:05  Maxdamantus: But there are two nouns, one is plural, the other is.. possibly singular.
18:05  Maxdamantus: "many languages", "perl 6"
18:05  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: however, it is not incorrect to use 'The Clash are a well-known band' in AmE. Since it is still just English. English is one of the most hacked-together language outthere
18:06  Maxdamantus: I'd use "is" there.
18:06  Maxdamantus: Hm, that's just strange.
18:06  Maxdamantus: Can you apply that logic to anything that's made up of atoms?
18:07  gkatsev: Maxdamantus: yeah, because even though the Clash is a band made up of several people, it feels more correct to refer to the whole thing as an atom, right?
18:07  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Only if you're a radical skeptic. :D
18:07  gkatsev: anyway, lunch.
18:07  gkatsev: brb
18:08  Maxdamantus: rationalOgre are a person.
18:08  granden: Anyone used the facebook sharer.php function to share webpages made in jquery/javascript?
18:08  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Hehe
18:08  granden: Would need some help how to set an icon for it
18:09  Manifesto: is there a site to show (possibly) all the quirks between browsers?
18:09  Maxdamantus: Perl 6 sounds singular though. Perhaps it's meant to be "Perl 6 is a lot of languages"
18:09  Manifesto: besides quirksmode
18:14  Symmetre: anyone know how to get gmt in javascript.  not the local computer's time gmt offset, but actual GMT
18:14  Maxdamantus: No one uses GMT anymore.
18:15  Symmetre: what do they use?
18:15  Maxdamantus: Actually, maybe some people do, in specific cases.
18:15  Maxdamantus: UTC.
18:15  kicken: GMT and UTC are the same
18:15  Symmetre: yeah they are
18:15  Maxdamantus: No they're not.
18:15  kicken: just different names
18:15  Symmetre: well i need a standard reference time
18:16  Maxdamantus: UTC updates leap seconds as they happen.
18:16  Maxdamantus: GMT afaik waits a year or so.
18:16  Symmetre: how do i get a standard time into javascript
18:16  rationalOgre: http://geography.about.com/od/timeandtimezones/a/gmtutc.htm
18:16  Maxdamantus: I think UTC has two slots in a year for potential leapseconds
18:16  Maxdamantus: and then GMT adjusts to UTC some time.
18:17  rationalOgre: Symmetre: call out to a UTC service?
18:19  kicken: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toUTCString
18:19  rationalOgre: Symmetre: You know JS' Date() works with UTC, right?
18:19  Maxdamantus: Yeah imo if you want the date reasonably accurately, use a service.
18:19  Maxdamantus: You can't trust the user's clock.
18:19  Symmetre: ok taht converts the local comptuers time to UTC.  i need UTC regardless of local computer's time
18:19  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: True.
18:20  rationalOgre: Symmetre: then you need a trusted third party. Use a service.
18:20  kicken: Symmetre, utc time is the same regardless of timezone
18:20  rationalOgre: kicken: Yes, but not the same regardless of users computer settings.
18:20  rationalOgre: if I set my clock to 5pm, sure Date() will accurately convert that to UTC
18:21  Symmetre: right rationalOgre, but i dont want YOUR clocks date in UTC
18:21  Symmetre: i want UTC
18:21  rationalOgre: Symmetre: And like I've said several times now. You are going to need a service for that.
18:22  Symmetre: ok so to use a service in javascript, do I need to tie that into code behind or anything else or can a service be used in javascript solely with javascript?
18:23  Maxdamantus: Symmetre: if you're using PHP on the server, and you trust that the server's time is right, <?php echo microtime(true); ?>
18:23  Maxdamantus: iirc
18:23  Maxdamantus: I think microtime gets UTC.
18:23  rationalOgre: You can consume a service solely with JavaScript. Depends on the API the service is using.
18:23  Maxdamantus: 1291224223.07
18:24  Maxdamantus: Meh, that's seconds.
18:24  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Yeah but you can coerce that into a Date(), no?
18:24  kicken: *1000
18:24  Maxdamantus: Yes.
18:24  granden: Ok, is there any way, I mean really any way even if its ugly as hell, to manipulate the <meta> tags with javascript?
18:24 --- fels is now known as fel
18:24  Maxdamantus: granden: no. Why would you?
18:25  rationalOgre: granden: You would have to use some server side tech for that.
18:25  granden: Maxdamantus: Because the facebook page, http://facebook.com/sharer.php reads the meta tag to determine which image to use for icon preview on the facebook wall.
18:26  granden: And my image gallery is in jquery
18:26  kicken: I'm sure their sharer.php script isn't going to execute javascript code.
18:26  Maxdamantus: You want to dynamically change the icon preview?
18:26  Maxdamantus: You won't be able to do that.
18:26  Maxdamantus: Wall posts are static.
18:27  granden: nono, not to change it dynamicly all the time like that.
18:27  granden: I got a Share on facebook- button.
18:27  granden: And it grabs an image
18:27  granden: from the webpage
18:27  granden: specified in the meta-tags
18:27  granden: And when I change image in the jquery-gallery, i would like to change to the new picture
18:27  granden: to use for the share on facebook button
18:27  Maxdamantus: and does Facebook actually run the Javascript?
18:28  kicken: granden, do they use a local JS include to get the image, or does their php script request the page and parse it?
18:28  kicken: if the latter, you can't do anything about it.  If the former, you may be able to do something with document.getElementsByTagName()
18:29  granden: I dont know, on both Maxdamantus ond kickens questions :)
18:29  Maxdamantus: granden: it won't run the JS.
18:30  granden: Guess it wont be possible then :(
18:30  granden: To bad they dont have any parmeter for the icon preview, just url and title. :(
18:31  Maxdamantus: Do you have the sharer in an iframe or something?
18:31  granden: No, not right now.
18:32  Maxdamantus: So where does the user see the share button?
18:32  granden: Its directly on the webpage. But you gave me an idea.
18:32  granden: I will try that.
18:32  Maxdamantus: How is it on the webpage?
18:32  Maxdamantus: Oh, you mean it's a share link that opens the sharer?
18:32  granden: When clicking the button it should open a pop-up, in that ppup I could then set a specific meta-tag.
18:33  granden: Maxdamantous yes
18:33  Maxdamantus: and you pass the URL something like /sharer.php?url=http://...
18:33  granden: Using PHP I should be ale to set a meta-tag right?
18:33  Maxdamantus: Yes, you can echo it.
18:33  granden: Ah, I think I got a solution then. Thanks fur the help.
18:34  Maxdamantus: Presumably you'd also want the shared link to jump to the image the sharer was on when they hit "Share"
18:34  rationalOgre: granden: Apparenly you can access meta tags through JQuery
18:34  granden: Yes, I got that solved.
18:35  Maxdamantus: Mk.
18:35  granden: rationalOgre: But can I change them?
18:35  granden: Thats what I need
18:35  Maxdamantus: rationalOgre: it won't help though, Facebook's not running JS.
18:35  granden: not just access them.
18:35  granden: doh
18:35  Maxdamantus: Why would you want to change meta tags anyway?
18:36  Maxdamantus: (as in, why does jQuery have that functionality)
18:36  Maxdamantus: Oh, you said access, not change.
18:36  rationalOgre: Maxdamantus: Because what happens is facebook traces back to where the share link was clicked and reads the meta tags to set certain parameters.
18:37  kicken: I'm sure you could change them, same as you can change any node.  I agree it seems pointless though
18:37  rationalOgre: But yeah, that's still not gonna work.
18:37  Maxdamantus: kicken: you can't change any node.
18:37  Maxdamantus: kicken: you can't change the <title> element for example.
18:37  Maxdamantus: or <head>
18:37  Maxdamantus: or most other head-specific elements.
18:37  Maxdamantus: I think you can't change any element under <head> no matter the type.
18:38 --- Liquide is now known as L|Away
18:38  Rufus: Greetings. Is there a way to have java call for an external php file with onclick event? Something like onclik='execute(file.php);' ? I don't need the output of the file. It's only used to set session variables.
18:38  Maxdamantus: It's usually useless, which is why, and also, the head element represents everything that a header represents, it's not just your <head> HTML converted to a node.
18:39  Maxdamantus: Rufus: Java? Javascript?
18:39  Rufus: Maxdamantus javascript, sorry
18:39  Maxdamantus: Rufus: ajax, or hidden iframe.
18:39  Maxdamantus: (imo, ajax would be better)
18:40  Rufus: Maxdamantus any referances on that please?
18:40  Maxdamantus: `mdc xmlhttprequest
18:40  Maxdamantus: Meh.
18:40  Maxdamantus: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest
18:41  Rufus: I'll go read. thanks Maxdamantus
18:41  Maxdamantus: There's also a "using" link there, but, hmm..
18:41  Maxdamantus: MDC has craploads of wiki errors atm.
18:42  kicken: Maxdamantus, http://www.aoeex.com/test.html changes the title just fine.  your not restricted to only changing <body> elements.
18:42  Altreus: halps. I'm doing a C-style for loop, but without let, I can't make the index variable local to the block. How can I create a closure inside the body of the loop that, when run as a callback, remembers the value of i as it was when the closure was created? Currently, when it runs, i == 4, the max. index of the array.
18:42  Maxdamantus: kicken: only on your browser.
18:43  Maxdamantus: and maybe som others.
18:43  Maxdamantus: You can't directly modify a <title> element.
18:43  rationalOgre: Worked in Chrome.
18:43  Maxdamantus: That's why there's a provided document.title
18:43  kicken: seems to work in everything except IE
18:44  weedar: If I change the position of elements with Javascript after the page is loaded, will that change be visible if I print the page or will that only print the page as it was when first rendered?
18:44  Maxdamantus: I remember a few weeks ago someone tried to show me something similar with your same argument, and it simply failed in my Chromium build.
18:44  Maxdamantus: (throwing a "read only" error)
18:44  kicken: I have scripts that append elements to <head> too.
18:44  Maxdamantus: Maybe it randomly picks whether it's modifiable or not.
18:45  Maxdamantus: Perhaps for optimisation's sake.
18:45  TheSheep: Altreus: js only creates namespaces in functions, not inside loops
18:45  Maxdamantus: kicken: you can't do that either.
18:45  kicken: sure you can
18:45  Maxdamantus: kicken: it's perfectly valid to append scripts to body.
18:45  Maxdamantus: You can not modify the head.
18:45  kicken: yes you can
18:45  Maxdamantus: Check the DOM level 2.
18:45  Altreus: TheSheep: I know. But is there an answer to my problem?
18:46  Altreus: I need to remember what i is somehow
18:46  Altreus: hmm I could call a function with i. That would have its own scope
18:46  Altreus: oh!
18:46  TheSheep: Altreus: pass it as an argument to a function that returns the closure
18:46  Altreus: for(...) { (function(idx){})(i) }
18:46  Altreus: like this!
18:46  Altreus: good problem-bearing, guys
18:46  Altreus: :)
18:47  kicken: Maxdamantus, DOM doesn't say anything about what can and can't be modified, afaik.
18:47  Maxdamantus: It does.
18:47  Maxdamantus: Sec, will find it.
