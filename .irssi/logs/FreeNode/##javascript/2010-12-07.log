00:18  joo: jrabbit, no, but you can make one
00:18  joo: js> String.prototype.format = function (a) { return this.replace(/%(\d)/g, function (b, c) { return a[c]; }) }; "%0 is %1 and %2".format(["winter","cold","unforgiving"])
00:18  gbot2: joo: "winter is cold and unforgiving"
00:18  jrabbit: joo: hm
00:18  jrabbit: joo: is that thesimplest way though
00:19  joo: Or better yet!
00:19  jrabbit: should I jsut make it project + "filename.dat" ?
00:19  joo: js> String.prototype.format = function () { var a = arguments; return this.replace(/%(\d)/g, function (b, c) { return a[c]; }) }; "%0 is %1 and %2".format(["winter","cold","unforgiving"])
00:19  gbot2: joo: "winter,cold,unforgiving is undefined and undefined"
00:19  joo: err
00:19  joo: js> String.prototype.format = function () { var a = arguments; return this.replace(/%(\d)/g, function (b, c) { return a[c]; }) }; "%0 is %1 and %2".format("winter","cold","unforgiving")
00:19  gbot2: joo: "winter is cold and unforgiving"
00:20  joo: But yes, using the concatenation operator is a viable alternative
00:20  jrabbit: i.e. I want to progamtically generate 'erc32-O2pD-ranges-1.dat'
00:21  jrabbit: will 'erc32'  + '-O2pD-ranges-1.dat' act the way I expect?
00:21  jrabbit: or do I need to declare it as a variable
00:21  joo: That depends what you expect
00:21  joo: js> 'erc32' + '-O2pD-ranges-1.dat'
00:21  gbot2: joo: "erc32-O2pD-ranges-1.dat"
00:23  jrabbit: ok I can put that inside a funcrion?
00:23  joo: jrabbit, in what way?
00:24  joo: just putting function () { 'erc32' + '-O2pD-ranges-1.dat' } won't do anything

00:38  sipher: So window.top.postMessage doesn't seem to work and I have no idea why. Calling it from an iframe and trying to handle the event on the containing page. No errors are thrown, it just doesn't work.
00:38  Pilate: are they on the same domain?
00:38  sipher: Yes but really it shouldn't matter
00:39  sipher: That's the whole point of postMessage
00:41  sipher: http://statusbarn.com/tests/gs/test.html <-- a test
00:42  Jjurach: 1: (function(){ var foo = "foo1"; window.alert(foo); })();
00:42  Jjurach: 2: if (true) { var foo = "foo2"; window.alert(foo); }
00:42  peeps[lappy]: `doesn't work @ sipher
00:42  jsBot: sipher: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
00:42  Jjurach: i don't want a global foo.  why would i favor #1 over #2?
00:43  peeps[lappy]: oh, no errors thrown, hmm
00:43  Jjurach: and jslint.com complains that my #1 refers to "Global foo"
00:45  peeps[lappy]: nm, i'm tired.  time to go home
00:46  sipher: So yeah, it also doesn't work in Chrome so I'm doing something wrong.. but my example is so simple that I have no idea what
00:49  Jjurach: is postMessage() specific to firefox?
00:49  sipher: no
00:49  sipher: It's an HTML 5 method supported by Firefox, Chrome, webkit, Opera
00:49  sipher: and IE*
00:50 --- MonsterKiller is now known as monsterkiller
00:50  sipher: It's for cross-domain/window messaging
00:53  Jjurach: http://robertnyman.com/2010/03/18/postmessage-in-html5-to-send-messages-between-windows-and-iframes/ is much more verbose than what you have..  i'm pretty new to javascript and don't have much to say this topic.
00:55  Jjurach: that demo is from containing to iframe, not vice versa.  also, there might be an document-ready issue.   maybe the top frame isn't ready before the iframe posts its message.
00:55  Jjurach: maybe put the postMessage in a timeout handler
00:55  sipher: They're just adding security checks. I left mine intentionally simple for debugging
00:56  sipher: Jjurach: There's no reason it shouldn't work from the iframe out.. but I adjusted my test to work the other way since all examples show that method. Still not working. I'm thinking a document-ready issue too maybe.
00:56  sipher: but it should be throwing an error IMO
00:57  sipher: if that's the case
00:57  Jjurach: in a pubsub model, pub shouldn't care if there isn't a sub yet.
00:57  sipher: Ah. That's true.
00:58  Jjurach: sipher: is (window.top === document) ?
00:58  Jjurach: document !== window
00:59  sipher: Nope. It's a window
00:59  sipher: window.top "Returns a reference to the topmost window in the window hierarchy. "
01:00  Jjurach: a listener on document will catch events raised on window?  does window have a document or does document have a window?
01:02  Jjurach: maybe you should window.addEventListener(..)  instead of document.~ ?
01:03  sipher: I took the listener code directly from MDC
01:03  sipher: so apparently yes, the message event is dispatched to the document
01:04  sipher: NO
01:04  sipher: WAIT
01:04  sipher: OMG
01:04  sipher: WORKS!
01:04  Jjurach: i thought you said you didn't have a problem on a mdc-related browser?
01:04  sipher: I love you

12:28  TheSheep: alaing: how would I know that?

12:47  pen: but sometimes they are inside a iframe
12:47  alaing: and hide it
12:47  alaing: ou maybe be able to search for iframes and then search of swf
12:47  pen: and flashblock just listen to DOMContentLoaded and DOMNodeInserted and only search for embed and object they are able to block even iframes
12:47  pen: alaing: how?
12:48  pen: iframe is iframe, the url might not always ends up with .swf
12:49  alaing: you can search for iframe by $('iframe').length if greater than 0 then iframes exists
12:49 --- Channel ##javascript was synced in 147 seconds
12:49  pen: alaing: but not all iframes contain flash
12:50  alaing: I know I'm just checking on the #jquery to see if you can search within the iframe
12:50  alaing: apparently you can search an iframe if its local
12:51  pen: usually flash in iframe is not
12:54  alaing: hmmmm
12:54  alaing: object ones are easy
12:54  pen: yea
12:55  pen: that's why DOMNodeInserted is useful I guess
12:55  alaing: should maybe try ask on #jquery
13:20  muckymouse: Hi, I'm trying to right a program in javascript  that reads an XML file of cars for sale. a form is then displayed and you have to enter a price range, the program is meant to show all cars in the XML file within the price range entered.. thats where I'm having problems..is there an operator for range in javascript? i've tried '| |' but it just displays the entire contents of the XML file
13:31  FernandoBasso: I got li1 by its id. Now, I dow, var li2 = li1.nextSibling; li2.style.color = 'Somecolor' and it says li2.style is undefined. Any ideas?
13:31  FernandoBasso: s/dow/do/
13:33  Maxdamantus: muckymouse: you can use both < and > operators to check a range.
13:33  aro: is there a good way to generate a unique id with JS
13:33  FernandoBasso: firebug says li2 is <TextNode textContent="\n ">
13:33  Maxdamantus: js> var x = 42; x > 10 && x < 50;
13:33  gbot2: Maxdamantus: true
13:33  Maxdamantus: aro: id for what?
13:34  muckymouse: as in number1 < > number2
13:34  muckymouse: ?
13:34  aro: just for a DOM element
13:34  aro: it would be temporary
13:34  Maxdamantus: muckymouse: like I just used it.
13:34  aro: just so i can bind to it
13:34  Maxdamantus: aro: why do you need an ID for that?
13:34  Maxdamantus: If you're assigning IDs from JS, you're doing it wrong imo
13:34  aro: because i need to bind to it with another function
13:35  Maxdamantus: aro: if you're setting the ID, then presumably you have the element.
13:35  Maxdamantus: What do you mean by "bind"?
13:36  aro: sigh nevermind
13:38  Maxdamantus: aro: perhaps you don't realise that document.getElementById("foo") is an object value, which can be used and passed around just like other values?
13:40  aro: i do realise that
13:41  aro: thats not what i am doing though
13:41  Maxdamantus: Then why do you need to assign an element you've already referenced an ID?
13:50  glontu: hi
13:50 --- lonatix is now known as csmrfx
13:51  glontu: is there a way to call a function if i determine it's name programatically ? like ... funcName = something['this']+somethingelse['that']
13:51  glontu: and then call funcName(param1,param2) ?
13:51  glontu: like php call_user_func_array
13:52  Maxdamantus: Yes.
13:52  glontu: great
13:52  Maxdamantus: But you shouldn't need to.
13:52  glontu: small example ?
13:52  glontu: why ?
13:52  Maxdamantus: PHP has that because of its previous design failures regarding function values.
13:52  glontu: ok so i have some 4-5 functions
13:53  glontu: and another main function that is supposed to call one of them according to the params it receives
13:53  Maxdamantus: If it's defined in the global scope, you can use the global object (window) to reference it as a property.
13:53  Maxdamantus: Otherwise you could use a direct call to eval to resolve the name in the current scope.
13:54  Maxdamantus: (But you shouldn't need to do either)
13:54  glontu: so ... got a better ideea ?
13:54  Maxdamantus: glontu: in JS functions are values, which you can pass around.
13:55  Maxdamantus: js> function foo(a){ print(a); } function bar(f){ f("baz"); } bar(foo);
13:55  gbot2: Maxdamantus: baz
13:55  glontu: Maxdamantus: this is my setup http://pastebin.com/D2RKiHXx
13:56  Maxdamantus: What's the source of data?
13:56  glontu: some json
13:56  glontu: from ajax
13:56  Maxdamantus: Okay, well it looks like you shouldn't need to pollute the global scope with your functions like that.
13:56  Maxdamantus: As I said, functions are values, objects map strings to values.
13:57  glontu: ok, i guess i can put them in $.fn. as i've seen somewhere
13:57  glontu: but how to call one of them to parse a json branch
13:57  Maxdamantus: So you might want to do somthing like: var handlers = { BhBulletin: function(value){ alert(value); } };
13:57  glontu: if the json has a branch named BhBulletin i want to call BhBulletinHandler on that branch
13:58  Maxdamantus: Then in your loop you'll just call handlers[dataHandler]("test");
13:58  glontu: oh ... and then ... handlers['name'](param1,param2) ?
13:58  Maxdamantus: Yes.
13:58  glontu: great
13:58  glontu: thanks
13:58  Maxdamantus: np
13:59  Maxdamantus: imo it's good in JS to keep all scopes minimal, especially teh global one.

15:18  rupert88: How much of facebook is javascript?
15:19  coda^: 17%
15:19  rupert88: I assumed facebook would fall apart without javascript enabled but it seems fine still
15:19  TheSheep: 17.2%
15:19  coda^: :>
15:19  rupert88: i mean the ability to move content around dynamically on the page
15:19  rupert88: how is that done without js?
15:20  TheSheep: coda^: did you know that 17 is the most random number?
15:22  coda^: heh, no but it's hardly difficult to believe :)
15:22  coda^: facebook must have picked it for a reason
15:22  rupert88: lol, ah for some reason when i ticked no javascript in chrome it ignored me
15:23  rupert88: in firefox certain things just dont work
15:23  coda^: you can only do progressive enhancement so much
15:23  coda^: and then there's minimal requirements
15:26  coda^: the most random two-digit number is 37, When groups of people are polled to pick a .random number between 1 and 100., the most commonly chosen number is 37.
15:27  coda^: whereas 17 is the least random number :)
15:27  coda^: if you believe http://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/~inky/jargon/html/R/random-numbers.html
15:27  FireFly: But within certain groups I think 42 would be a common random two-digit number
15:28  FireFly: Jargon file :D
15:28  coda^: if they read certain books then sure :)
15:31  pen: how do I set the width and height of one element to be the same as the other element?
15:32  FireFly: If possible, try to use CSS for it. Otherwise, it's possible to retrieve the rendered size of a given element, but you'd have to do some trickery for IE compability

15:38  Izhido: burn your hands. deeply. with an iron. and never touch a computer / network again. EVER.
15:40  brainsoft: me?
15:42  coda^: i am not sure if click events on iframes can bubble in a way that lets you capture the click brainsoft
15:42  coda^: tbh your best bet is to use the api of analytics
15:42  coda^: and reconcile on second visit
15:42  EvanR-work: in any case you cant quickly ajax something *before* the page switches to the sponsors webpage
15:43  EvanR-work: not sanely
15:43  coda^: any tampering with the flow of adverts and click throughs may also result in losing the account
15:44  AdvoWork: just looked on firebugs pagespeed and it states i can make my pages load faster if i compress my js files, into gzip? how would I go about doing this, and is it really worth doing?
15:44  EvanR-work: by compress most people mean remove whitespace and rename variables
15:44  Izhido: isn't that what opera does?
15:44  coda^: yes and apache does it for you if supported, you need to set some filters in htaccess
15:45  EvanR-work: but user agents / web servers do real compression if both sides support it. which totally trumps 'minification'
15:45  coda^: AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript
15:45  ablomen: AdvoWork, its a serverside question really, you can either let your serverside programming language handle the compression or your server software
15:45  coda^: <Files *.js>
15:45  coda^: SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
15:45  coda^: </Files>
15:45  coda^: in my .htaccess
15:45  coda^: works fine
15:46  EvanR-work: coda^: you do this instead of minification?
15:46  coda^: it will depend on your web server install but in terms of benefits, its like compressing a file.
15:46  coda^: say mootools from 66k is actually 24 in transit
15:47  coda^: minifying can squeeze out more
15:47  coda^: but it also reduces the compression rate
15:47  EvanR-work: i havent tried it, but im thinking its not worth it
15:48  coda^: depends. must faster for clients. much less bandwith use
15:48  AdvoWork: coda^, so that would in theory make things load faster?
15:48  EvanR-work: on the other hand some people claim that the proportion of user agents who cant inflate is high
15:48  coda^: yes
15:48  coda^: its a win win
15:48  AdvoWork: where would I set that filter then?
15:48  coda^: no downside to it cept for some small cpu overhead
15:48  coda^: in your .htaccess
15:48  EvanR-work: inflate deflate has insignificant cpu overhead
15:48  coda^: esp when cached after
15:49  coda^: and you don't care about deflate thats clientside
15:49  EvanR-work: you mean inflate
15:49  coda^: and the client has p[lenty of time to deflate while the ui thread deals with assets waterfall
15:49  coda^: er yes
15:49  coda^: :)
15:49  EvanR-work: zlib ftw
15:50  EvanR-work: who do these lzma clowns think they are
15:50  AdvoWork: is there a way i can test this before/after?
15:50  coda^: pagespeed
15:50  coda^: and yslow
15:50  coda^: let you see the benefits
15:50  coda^: they show you for each asset the before and after
15:50  coda^: if supported
15:51  coda^: just profile a site that does this
15:51  coda^: eg
15:51  coda^: on our server
15:51  AdvoWork: are there any potential problems in doing this?
15:51  domsz: if i add the meta tag "apple-mobile-web-app-capable" my web page will no longer show the navigation bar, when it is added to the iphone's home screen - which is good. question: can i somehow figure out IF my web app was started from the home screen?
15:52  coda^: js 67.1K 21.0K js/mootools-1.2.5-core-yc.js 2010/12/9152 "6807f32c-10652-490eb924bd440"
15:52  domsz: i need to know this, so i can adjust my UI to the few more pixels that i then have
15:52  coda^: no problems. if the client does not support it
15:52  coda^: the server sends the normal version
15:52  ablomen: AdvoWork, pages loading so fast your brain explodes!
15:52  coda^: and clients support it since ie 3
15:53  ablomen: i have not noticed any problems with any browser/os thus far
15:53  coda^: heh, prolly even lynx supports it :)
15:53  coda^: for documents anyway
15:53  AdvoWork: does this have to go in htaccess?
15:53  coda^: or httpd.conf
15:54  coda^: for php compression, no you can control the document produced via directives
15:54  coda^: for css and js, htaccess
15:54  AdvoWork: ok, so: if i edit httpd.conf add that in(as above) then sudo /etc/init.d apache restart ? jobs a goodun?
15:54  coda^: you can enable zlib compression for php via htaccess also
15:55  Jjurach: am i missing something, or is  if (true) { var foo; ... }  just as good as  (function(){ var foo; ... })();   in terms of not polluting the global namespace?
15:55  ablomen: Jjurach, you are missing something, javascript does not have a different scope for if/while/etc loops
15:55  coda^: AdvoWork i would say, safer to do in htaccess but yeah, it ought to be fine. if you break your conf through and your server stops working i am not fixing it :)
15:56  coda^: Jjurach no block scope in js
15:56  Jjurach: excellent. that's good to know. thanks
15:56  coda^: it hoists vars
15:57  Intel_iX: vars are indeed saved at function level. try the function call if you want to save them like that.
15:57  Intel_iX: Also, blocks don't need an if statement if I recall correctly.
15:58  Jjurach: i think they do
15:58  EvanR-work: or a let
15:58  Jjurach: i was playing on jslint.com or something similar and had problems without if (true(
15:59  coda^: Jjurach it is because it hoists
15:59  AdvoWork: coda^, just tried that, hasnt really made any noticable difference :(
15:59  Jjurach: i think without the conditional, it looks like an object initializer
16:00  coda^: basically if you have
16:00  Jjurach: coda^: you convinced me.  i appreciate the insight
16:01  coda^: if (typeof foo something) { var foo = bar; ... } this actually goes var foo; if (typeof foo something) { foo = bar; }
16:01  Intel_iX: I notice a lot of people using for loops, when i-- works a lot better.
16:01  Intel_iX: It's a lot faster in terms of speed.
16:01  coda^: which means foo will never be undefined at the if point
16:01  AdvoWork: coda^, so if no noticable change, does that mean its either not working or?
16:01  coda^: AdvoWork you check pagespeed
16:01  coda^: or yslow
16:01  coda^: and see if it has detected the compression
16:02  coda^: eg in yslow, profile, then go components, then js
16:02  coda^: 3rd column is gzip size
16:02  coda^: it will be empty if it failed
16:04  AdvoWork: coda^, pagespeed shows: Compressing http://....file.js could save 269.2KiB (91% reduction).  so i assume thats a no?
16:06  {aaron}: hi, i'm trying to get some context into a callback, but it doesn't appear to be working: http://pastebin.com/1Zu7d62c
16:07  {aaron}: the caller's 'content' var is not altered after the call
16:07  coda^: probably not.
16:07  coda^: unless it has it cached
16:08  AdvoWork: coda^, just installed yslow, the JS section you refer to has stuff in, so that means its working?
16:09  coda^: yeah probably so.
16:09  coda^: it will give you
16:09  coda^: file -> size -> gzipped size
16:09  coda^: if you have gzipped size then you're fine
16:09  coda^: anyway, yslow > pagespeed
16:09  coda^: :)
16:10  coda^: Jjurach: http://wtfjs.com/2010/02/15/hoisting is fun :)
16:11  AdvoWork: coda^, on components, under js, the gzip column is empty for all files
16:11  coda^: then it has failed
16:11  coda^: read up
16:11  coda^: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#gzip
16:11  coda^: several ways of enabling it
16:12  coda^: and check if mod_gzip is installed
16:12  coda^: or mod_deflate
16:12  {aaron}: (ah i think it's because strings are immutable)
16:16  coda^: {aaron}: what are you trying to do?
16:17  coda^: maybe has content as a argument and wont alter it
16:19  coda^: http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8NpB/
16:20  {aaron}: coda^, yeah, it's the assignment that is the problem
16:20  {aaron}: using a mutable structure like array works
16:22  coda^: really? shouldn't do in the model you had
16:22  coda^: i would have thought
16:23  {aaron}: well, content[1] = "im changing this" ... ec.
16:23  {aaron}: etc.
16:28  petisnnake: hi im losing my mind. if i clearly have an image with id="axaj", how is it possible that document.getElementById('ajax') returns null ?
16:30  Narcissus: petisnnake: because axaj != ajax :eyebrows:
16:31  petisnnake: that's just a typo
16:31  petisnnake: nvm it must be some sort of idiot typo in my code aswell
16:34  petisnnake: Why on earth If i have an img with id="ajax" that is display: hidden via css, and in js I write document.getElementById('ajax').display = 'block'; doesnt show the image?
16:34  petisnnake: i dont get any console errors
16:35  gkatsev: because of how objects work
16:35  gkatsev: you want .style.display
16:35  gkatsev: js> var o = {}; o.display = 'block'; o;
16:35  gbot2: gkatsev: {display:"block"}
16:36  petisnnake: jesus thanks so much

16:40  pratz_: hey guys what is the best way to debug javascript ??
16:40  gkatsev: `console
16:40  gbot2: ##javascript is not your debugging console. For Firefox: Use Firebug <http://www.getfirebug.com/> and the error console; For Chrome: Use the built-in Chrome Developer Tools; For IE: Use Debug Bar <http://www.debugbar.com/>; For Safari: Use the Safari Dev Tools <http://developer.apple.com/technologies/safari/developer-tools.html>; Opera: Use DragonFly <http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/>

17:05  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: #jquery
17:05  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, it's raw js
17:06  EvanR-work: is there any semantic difference between undefined and null?
17:06  EvanR-work: or is it just a historical fixture
17:06  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, its called jQueWy, not jQuery, lol
17:06  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: it's still some random 3rd party code you want us to debug
17:06  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, all the code you see is mine
17:07  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: ah ok 1s
17:07  s0l1dsnak3123: thanks pigdude :)
17:07  gkatsev: EvanR-work: usually, you set something to null if you need to set it explicitly, while undefined is usually set implicitly, or so, i've seen it used.
17:07  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: well the error seemed to be  on the event bind
17:07  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: as it points to 141
17:07  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, that's what I figured, but I'm not sure why its failing
17:08  EvanR-work: gkatsev: im setting something 'to null' but wondered why im not using undefined
17:08 --- [1]pallet is now known as pallet[1]
17:09  gkatsev: EvanR-work: undefined can be defined. So, either set something to void 0 or null to make sure.
17:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: there is a GET 'undefined'
17:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: so check that
17:09  drey: jQuewy.data(); ?
17:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I think that is the issue
17:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: actually two GETs to 'undefined'
17:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: those respond w/ html which jacks up the js engine
17:09  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, i'll check that. drey, i reckon it might be to do with that too
17:09  EvanR-work: gkatsev: make sure of what?
17:10  gkatsev: EvanR-work: that you are using a pure value and not a defined undefined.
17:10  pigdude: EvanR-work: use 'delete'
17:10  pigdude: EvanR-work: this is the proper way to undefine a var
17:10  EvanR-work: its not a var
17:10  pigdude: EvanR-work: and a property
17:11  pigdude: EvanR-work: to unbind a reference to a value, so to speak
17:11  gkatsev: pigdude: delete is only on object's properties.
17:11  pigdude: EvanR-work: I'm sure the spec states it better
17:11  EvanR-work: its not imperative code, and im not trying to unbind anything
17:11  EvanR-work: im trying to denote a null value
17:11  pigdude: gkatsev: ah you're right, I guess I don't use it on vars...hm
17:12  EvanR-work: and theres no vars
17:12  pigdude: EvanR-work: then use null
17:12  EvanR-work: this is function parameters
17:12  EvanR-work: any reason?
17:12  pigdude: EvanR-work: maybe you should paste your code
17:12  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, I have the header on http://jquewy.com/dev/ set to "text/javascript". I've removed the redundant part of the url where the undefined error was being generated
17:12  gkatsev: EvanR-work: void 0 gurantees undefined in non-ES5 js.

17:12  EvanR-work: whats bike shedding

17:12  pigdude: EvanR-work: nit picking code for superficial details
17:13  EvanR-work: well im not the one who designed js, im not to blame for superficial and redundant
17:13  pigdude: EvanR-work: nevermind, just please paste your code
17:13  gkatsev: we dont need the code.
17:13  gkatsev: The question was whether there is a point to null
17:13  EvanR-work: inputC(null, type, name, value)
17:14  pigdude: EvanR-work: add if (src) in addScript
17:14  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: ^^
17:14  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: so that an undefined src is not fetched
17:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I expect your parsing of the arg string is producing two undefined script values
17:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: which your lib attempts to fetch
17:15  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, agreed
17:15  s0l1dsnak3123: it then takes the jsonp to find the url, then inserts them in the head
17:15  pigdude: k
17:16  pigdude: gkatsev: please don't say "we don't need the code", say "I don't need the code"
17:16  pigdude: gkatsev: I would very much like to see the code

17:17  EvanR-work: yes
17:17  EvanR-work: why not?
17:17  pigdude: EvanR-work: inputC is undefined
17:17  pigdude: EvanR-work: null is a reserved word
17:17  EvanR-work: ok but not because of the null
17:17  pigdude: EvanR-work: in other words, please paste your code

17:17  gbot2: EvanR-work: Error: ReferenceError: max is not defined
17:17  gkatsev: pigdude: to answer the question the code is not needed. It may help the specific case but unneeded.
17:17  pigdude: `paste @ EvanR-work
17:17  jsBot: EvanR-work: paste: Paste links, not code: http://erxz.com/pb/   http://pastebin.parentnode.org/   http://www.webdevout.net/test

17:18  pigdude: gkatsev: and possibly advise on a better approach
17:18  EvanR-work: function inputC(cl, type, name, value){ return tagA('input', removeNull({'class': cl, 'type': type, 'name': name, 'value': value})); }
17:18  pigdude: js> Math.max(null) // EvanR-work
17:18  gbot2: pigdude: 0
17:19  pigdude: EvanR-work: vals coerced to Number
17:19  EvanR-work: yes
17:19  EvanR-work: so null is not invalid
17:19  pigdude: js> [Number(null), +null] // EvanR-work
17:19  gbot2: pigdude: [0,0]
17:19  EvanR-work: im not doing arithmetic on null, lets stop that
17:19  pigdude: EvanR-work: what is "remove null"?
17:19  pigdude: EvanR-work: er removeNull
17:20  EvanR-work: gives an object with null properties removed
17:20  pigdude: EvanR-work: please don't paste your function definition like that...use a pastebin
17:20  pigdude: EvanR-work: this isn't difficult
17:21  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, putting console.log(lib_file); straight after line 28 gives nothing, could that be the problem?
17:21  EvanR-work: http://codepad.org/5RxmGHHZ
17:21  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: it's pretty clear you have unintended requests to 'undefined'
17:21  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: that is the glaring issue
17:21  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: eliminate those
17:21  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: by not requesting undefined, by checking if (src)
17:22  EvanR-work: you can replace null with undefined in all this, i was just wondering why anyone would choose either
17:23  EvanR-work: or why theres two values
17:23  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, if you mean the resulting script tags, then I'll add a check for them and stop them being added :)
17:26  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, I've now added an if() to make sure jquewy doesn't pass through undefined scripts, so now I get an exception: http://dev.johnhamelink.com/jquery/jquewy/ Is this what you were looking for?
17:28  gkatsev: EvanR-work: null is supposed to be for when you want to explicitly set a value to an empty one while undefined is a default empty value. Null is also a read-only object always (i believe) while undefined is read-only only starting with ES5
17:28  EvanR-work: gkatsev: interesting
17:29  EvanR-work: reminds me of 'what is nil really' in lisp ;)
17:29  gkatsev: heh
17:29  EvanR-work: is the standard way
17:29  EvanR-work: to test for null === null?

17:30  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: well of course, that is an exception you throw :^)
17:30  gkatsev: yes
17:30  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I don't see why you throw it
17:31  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: should this really be an error that can halt execution?
17:31  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: when it is your poor string parsing or other logic that is producing undefined values from valid input?
17:31  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, it means that the jsonp hasn't loaded as far as i can tell
17:31  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, is there a way for me to wait until the jsonp has loaded before doing anything further?
17:33  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, when I say "hasn't loaded", I mean "hasn't loaded at the time of execution"
17:35  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: the exception you are throwing makes no sense
17:35  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: at all
17:35  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: the message is misleading, false
17:36  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, to be honest i only wanted it there to check to see that was the problem
17:36  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: the argument 'src' should be a string, based on usage I see here
17:36  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: if (src) { /* do everything */ }
17:37  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: obviously nothing should happen if src is empty

17:37  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I've offered all the help I can
17:38  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I cannot impart common sense
17:39  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, do you know why src is undefined? I believe it's because my jsonp has not loaded at the time of execution. I'm not sure how to implement a way to wait until it becomes a variable. This was my original questino
17:39  s0l1dsnak3123: *question
17:40  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: or maybe it's error-prone stuff like 						lib = lib_file[arg[i].toLowerCase()];
17:40  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: with no checks after
17:40  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: pretty obvious where your undefineds come from
17:40  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: and are you sure you wrote this script?
17:40  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, please don't insult me like that
17:40  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: because you seem to not understand how your own addScript function works
17:41  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: it accepts a src url
17:41  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: not source code

17:47  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, it's basically a loader for libraries, designed to be used for quick prototyping of js ideas in your head. The backend handles all sorts of cool stuff such as CDN management, hotlinking prevention, dynamic compression, etc

17:49  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, the backend is complete, I'm now trying to get the js up to par with the backend
17:49  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: what about that one bridge you were telling me about? still available?
17:50  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, sorry what do you mean by bridge?

17:53  pigdude: yea, I wouldn't even be saying this is a product around IRC to be honest s0l1dsnak3123
17:53  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, my code was working until I revamped the backend. This is in heavy development, and I've not started marketing...
17:53  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I'm a little less inclined to help for that reason
17:53  Wes: The Tacoma Narrows bridge is a type of CDN
17:53  EvanR-work: well thats because pigdude hates freedom
17:53  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: your issue has _nothing_ to do with the backend
17:53  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: it is a basic basic JS issue

17:54  s0l1dsnak3123: I've not started marketing, its no where need a product stage...
17:54  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined
17:55  EvanR-work: but in this case you need to find the source of the unexpected undefined value
17:55  pigdude: js> String(undefined) // s0l1dsnak3123
17:55  gbot2: pigdude: "undefined"
17:55  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, thanks for some productive information
17:55  Wes: js> (function(a,b,c) { return c; })()
17:55  gbot2: Wes: undefined
17:55  Wes: s0l1dsnak3123: ^^^^
17:55  EvanR-work: s0l1dsnak3123: are you being sarcastic?
17:55  s0l1dsnak3123: no im not
17:55  pigdude: EvanR-work: no he is very confused
17:55  s0l1dsnak3123: it is literally the most productive thing anyone has said so far
17:56  pigdude: EvanR-work: he mistook my specific patches etc as non-productive
17:56  EvanR-work: gkatsev: so basically undefined could be seen as an error? and null as not an error
17:56  EvanR-work: like in this case
17:56  EvanR-work: with s0l1dsnak3123
17:56  pigdude: EvanR-work: his script is GETing 'undefined'
17:56  EvanR-work: url = undefined
17:56  EvanR-work: ?
17:56  pigdude: EvanR-work: it is so obvious it is making my head hurt, and I really must go now
17:56  pigdude: EvanR-work: yes
17:56  EvanR-work: k
17:56  pigdude: EvanR-work: he is acccessing undefiend array indices
17:56  EvanR-work: that wont work ;)
17:57  pigdude: EvanR-work: I said wrap addScript body in simple if (src) {
17:57  pigdude: EvanR-work: and he won't do it
17:57  pigdude: EvanR-work: instead he did if (!src) { throw 'misleading message'; }
17:57  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, I did do it.
17:57  remonvv: Hi guys. Should this work? : javascript hosted on one.domain.com makes a request to one.domain.com that sets a cookie for the domain ".domain.com". Now Javascript on one.domain.com makes a request to two.domain.com but the cookie is not added.
17:57  EvanR-work: i would just fix the message
17:57  pigdude: it shouldn't be an exception
17:57  gkatsev: EvanR-work: yes. Only time you should ever get null in js is if someone explicitly set it.
17:57  pigdude: because it is not an error caused by the user
17:57  EvanR-work: i would consider in an exception
17:57  pigdude: but internally to the lib
17:58  EvanR-work: or error
17:58  pigdude: no
17:58  pigdude: it is defensive coding, because he has to defend against his own internal code
17:58  EvanR-work: the user could pass in undefined right?
17:58  pigdude: npo
17:58  pigdude: *no
17:58  EvanR-work: oh
17:58  pigdude: EvanR-work: read through latest.js
17:58  EvanR-work: i tried
17:58  pigdude: hehe
17:58  s0l1dsnak3123: for god's sake, can you please accept the following so we can move forward in a productive manner:
17:58  s0l1dsnak3123: 1] I know this is nothing to do with the syntax of the jsonp
17:59  s0l1dsnak3123: 2] I have done everything pigdude has recommended
17:59  EvanR-work: gkatsev: ah
17:59  Wes: remonvv: should be able to get that to work, double-check the cookie spec, you might need to specify "domain.com" instead of ".domain.com"
17:59  gkatsev: EvanR-work: as far as I know, at least.
17:59  s0l1dsnak3123: 3] I know its an undefined variable, but I want to make it NOT be an undefined variable
17:59  EvanR-work: gkatsev: cool idea, make the implementation throw an error if any expression evaluates to undefined ;)
17:59  Wes: remonvv: also make sure you don't have funny extra things set on your cookie, like a wierd path, or secure flag
17:59  remonvv: I tried both Wes
17:59  gkatsev: EvanR-work: heh
18:00  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I believe the following is causing your unhandled exception
18:00  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: 					document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);
18:00  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: you wrap in try, but again, uncaught exception in the engine
18:00  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: assign el and if (el) {
18:00  EvanR-work: s0l1dsnak3123: do you want a default value ?
18:00  Wes: remonvv: if you were my developer, I'd be telling you to break out the packet sniffer and minimized test cases now. :)
18:00  s0l1dsnak3123: EvamR-work no I don't
18:00  EvanR-work: ok then pass in not undefined
18:00  EvanR-work: easier said than done i know
18:00  EvanR-work: in js
18:01  remonvv: I'm a proxy for a dev next to me that refuses to install an IRC client :p
18:01  remonvv: And he's already sniffing
18:01  remonvv: The cookie is set and visible but it's not picked up by the second request.
18:02  remonvv: so not present in the request headers, basically
18:02  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, what you just said does not solve the problem at all
18:02  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, all it does is make the code skip over the undefined values
18:02  Wes: remonvv: If it's not present in the request headers, then it wasn't set in a way that allows the browser to send it
18:02  remonvv: That seems to be the case
18:02  Wes: remonvv: and please tell me you are not testing with IE or safari, as both have obnoxious corner cases
18:02  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, I don't want these values to be undefined, because they shouldn't be undefined
18:02  EvanR-work: s0l1dsnak3123: often a 'strategy' for js code, often stupid
18:03  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I have a local copy of this and I am working on it
18:03  remonvv: no we're validating with Chrome and FF
18:03  Wes: remonvv: Wierd - can't think of any reason why that wouldn't work for you.  Time to break out the minimized test case along with the packet sniffer!
18:03  remonvv: the cookie is set as "domain.com" so it should be cross subdomain compliant
18:03  remonvv: Indeed, oh well.
18:03  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, thank you
18:03  remonvv: Thanks.
18:05  s0l1dsnak3123: EvenR-work, I appreciate that, but I now have security against the scripts returning undefined as pigdude said I should do a long time ago. What to do next is to get it to return something other than undefined
18:05  EvanR-work: you have a problem with returning undefined now?
18:06  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, no what I'm trying to tell you is that undefined shouldn't be there in the first place
18:06  EvanR-work: be where?
18:06  s0l1dsnak3123: it should have a value when it loads the json
18:06  s0l1dsnak3123: in addScript
18:06  EvanR-work: in the arguments?
18:07  s0l1dsnak3123: undefined is being passed into the arguments
18:07  s0l1dsnak3123: so that src becomes undefined
18:07  EvanR-work: ok so find what is using addScript
18:07  s0l1dsnak3123: jQuewy.addScript(lib.url);
18:07  s0l1dsnak3123: as I've been saying
18:07  s0l1dsnak3123: lib refers to the jsonP
18:07  EvanR-work: where does lib come from
18:08  s0l1dsnak3123: which can only be undefined when its not loaded
18:08  s0l1dsnak3123: as I've been trying to say for the past 30+ mins
18:08  EvanR-work: well not in general
18:08  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: chrome produces a more informative error message
18:08  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'data' of object function (){
18:08  EvanR-work: there would be an error somewhere else if lib was undefined
18:08  s0l1dsnak3123: hmm
18:08  EvanR-work: your problem that lib does not have property url
18:08  EvanR-work: or does and its value is undefined
18:08  EvanR-work: which is less likely
18:09  s0l1dsnak3123: yes, because its wrapped around if(lib){}
18:09  EvanR-work: so what is producing the malformed lib
18:09  s0l1dsnak3123: my php
18:09  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: be sure that your dev url has finished loading before using the data property, I imagine
18:09  EvanR-work: ding ding ding
18:10  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, what did i ask you about 15 mins ago?
18:10  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, you think it's my php and not my js?
18:10  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: you tell me
18:10  EvanR-work: you just said lib is put there by php
18:10  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, no sorry - a missunderstanding
18:11  EvanR-work: whats producing the malformed lib structure?
18:11  s0l1dsnak3123: lib comes from lib_file which is the jsonp
18:11  s0l1dsnak3123: the jsonP comes from the php
18:11  EvanR-work: still sounds like php
18:11  s0l1dsnak3123: the php does not directly touch the page at all
18:11  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, I see
18:11  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: simple wrap if (jQuery.data) { in your main fixes this
18:12  EvanR-work: so its a premature execution thing?
18:12  pigdude: and I'm not even going to correct a typo that your lib encourages
18:12  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, you can see the jsonp here: http://jquewy.com/dev/?1291739752652
18:12  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, I think so
18:12  s0l1dsnak3123: I've been trying to say that for a while now
18:12  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: I get no exception if I check if (jWhatever.data)
18:12  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: at L28
18:13  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: and if I must say:
18:14  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: breaking up dependent scripts in this way is sorta counterintuitive
18:14  EvanR-work: s0l1dsnak3123: this link makes no sense to me, i dont even see identifiers we were discussing earlier, like lib_file and jsonP
18:14  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, that's because jquewy.data = "jQuery()"
18:14  s0l1dsnak3123: when you console.log
18:14  s0l1dsnak3123: (this is wrong)
18:14  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: your onload should first get the script that provides the data property
18:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: which should have a callback that makes your main function available
18:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: as it craps itself if that is not around
18:15  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work - check line 28, the jsonp is not a value
18:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: and really, why are you breaking this up?
18:15  EvanR-work: not that i said its a value, but what is it?
18:15  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, because it will dynamically generate
18:15  s0l1dsnak3123: the scripts available
18:15  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: why not burn it into the main script then?
18:16  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: you're just creating an extra http req for no reason
18:16  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: no clear reason
18:16  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, because its supposed to be downloaded locally and ran
18:16  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: you should sell tires
18:16  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work its a javascript file that contains a function which returns an object with libraries and their files
18:17  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, you should try not to be so patronising, please
18:17 * pigdude will not patronize w/ answers
18:17  EvanR-work: why is it called jsonp ?
18:17  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, that's fine
18:17  pigdude: s0l1dsnak3123: well yea because I already showed you how to fix your script, of course it is
18:18  s0l1dsnak3123: pigdude, its fine for you not to give me answers
18:18  TheSheep: EvanR-work: json with padding
18:18  s0l1dsnak3123: evanR-work, it needs to be jsonp to work cross-domain
18:21  EvanR-work: this is cool, so i can use "jsonp" to put a script from my server on facebook walls, visitors will get my js, and be able to ajax to my server
18:22  EvanR-work: upload their facebook session ID to me ;)
18:22  s0l1dsnak3123: EvanR-work, actually yes
18:22  s0l1dsnak3123: :P
18:29  Maxdamantus: What? Under FBJS?
18:29  Qci: what is faster/memory efficient (function(){}) or function.prototype ?
18:29 * Maxdamantus tries disabling the Facebook proxy option.
18:29  Qci: is there a different?
18:30  l4rk: Qci: what are you even talking about
18:30 --- beppu_ is now known as beppu
18:32  Maxdamantus: I think he means simply returning an object with some functions, or returning an object with a prototype with those functions.
18:32  l4rk: lol that was not clear at all
18:33  Maxdamantus: I'd guess the prototype method would probably be slightly more memory efficient, for functions that use many variables.
18:33  Qci: i note sure what are the right lingu for (function(){})
18:33  Maxdamantus: or perhaps even if you have many variables in scope.
18:33  Qci: not*
18:34  Maxdamantus: (as is the case in Spidermonkey 1.7)
18:34  Maxdamantus: (I think)
18:35  Qci: i think its faster as well, just want to be sure. prototype is good for memory
18:35  Qci: sorry for the english
18:35  Maxdamantus: In an optimal strict-mode only implementation, there shouldn't really be any difference.
18:36  Maxdamantus: Unless the functions perhaps reference many variables from the outer scope.
18:36  Maxdamantus: Well, using the model I'm thinking of anyway.
18:37  Maxdamantus: Actually, it wouldn't be bad in Spidermonkey.
18:38  Maxdamantus: Because apparently Spidermonkey binds levels of scope to functions.
18:38  Maxdamantus: (rather than binding individual variables - which would be better for GC, but worse for direct calls to eval)
18:39  Qci: here is a nice articale but its not answring the question http://www.packtpub.com/article/using-prototype-property-in-javascript
18:40  Qci: how do you call (function(){}) style?
18:40 * Maxdamantus doesn't really know too much about prototype stuff.. never used it.
18:40  Maxdamantus: Function expression?
18:40  Maxdamantus: js> void function(){ print("foo"); }();
18:40  gbot2: Maxdamantus: foo
18:40  Qci: so if i google function expression i will get this
18:40  Maxdamantus: Hehe, lose the last () and it's valid C.
18:41  Maxdamantus: When people refer to the "prototype chain", they refer transitively to the object's prototype?
18:43  Rockfang: hi all
18:43  Pilum: Lo
18:44  Qci: http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
18:47  Maxdamantus: "If a function foo(){} is part of, say, assignment expression, it is considered a function expression"
18:47  Maxdamantus: If it's part of any expression.
18:47  Maxdamantus: ie, it's not possible for it to be a statement.
18:47  Maxdamantus: Hm, same goes for {}
18:48  Rockfang: Does anyone know, with regards to the code at the following link, why the 2nd sentence disappears so quickly after being displayed? http://pastebin.com/TS00snh8
18:48  Maxdamantus: (but both's contexts are determined only on the first token)
18:48  Maxdamantus: Oh, it say sthat.
18:50  Rockfang: i don't get any errors in FF's error console.
18:50  Maxdamantus: Rockfang: does it happen to refresh the page?
18:50 * Maxdamantus forgot what to return from on* to cancel.
18:50  Pilum: false
18:50  Maxdamantus: undefined == false?
18:50  Pilum: And he doesn't, so it will.
18:51  Rockfang: i think it refreshes the page
18:51  Pilum: Eh?
18:51  kicken: Maxdamantus, not w/ respect to events
18:51  Pilum: What does undefined have to do with anything?
18:51  Maxdamantus: Will it cancel the submission on return undefined?
18:51  Pilum: Of course it won't.
18:51  Maxdamantus: Right, so it's doing teh submission.
18:51  Pilum: Indeed it is.
18:51  Maxdamantus: Yeah, you said that.
18:53  Rockfang: so i have to return false to stop the refreshing?
18:53  Maxdamantus: To stop it submitting, yeah.
18:53  Rockfang: i still want the user to be able to submit their words
18:53  Maxdamantus: Submit to where?
18:54  Rockfang: the function that displays the generated sentences
18:54  Rockfang: loadIt
18:55  Maxdamantus: Then yes, it will be "submitted" to that.
18:55  Maxdamantus: Submission in the context of HTML usually involves sending a request to the server in response to the user filling out a form.
18:55  Rockfang: ok.
18:56  Rockfang: im not sure what i have to change though to get the 2nd sentence to stop disappearing though.  sorry if i missed it.
18:57  kicken: Rockfang, you need your loadIt function to return false;
18:58  kicken: or change your onsubmit code to return false;
18:58  Rockfang: gotcha
18:58  Maxdamantus: You're just overwriting the content you just wrote with innerHTML
18:58  Rockfang: that i understand :)
18:58  kicken: onsubmit="loadIt(...); return false;" would work
18:58  Maxdamantus: document.getElementById('story').innerHTML = 'The '+noun1+' '+adverb+' '+verb+' on the '+noun2+'.';
18:58  Maxdamantus: document.getElementById('story').innerHTML = 'It is rare that a '+noun2+' will '+adverb+' '+verb+' a '+noun1+'.';
18:59  Maxdamantus: Oh, there's an alert there.
18:59  Rockfang: indeed
18:59  Rockfang: that was intentional
18:59  Maxdamantus: It's likely that it's not going to re-render the page from DOM until that function returns.
19:00  Maxdamantus: Does the first sentence appear as teh alert shows?
19:00  Rockfang: one moment
19:00  kicken: in my experience, blocking things like alert/confirm will usually allow the browser a chance to update the page.
19:01  Maxdamantus: Mm.. Perhaps.
19:01  Rockfang: Maxdamantus..yes..to your question
19:01  Maxdamantus: (Blocking things shouldn't exist)
19:01  Rockfang: ty both for the help.
19:01  Maxdamantus: Except maybe alert, which should be disabled in non-debug mode.
19:10 * ziyadb needs help with homework
19:13  ziyadb: http://pastebin.com/iF61b88U
19:13  ziyadb: take a look while I try to solve it myself.
19:17  ziyadb: joo my homework! I'm struggling
19:18  joo: What is it?
19:19  ziyadb: well I am trying to whatever my n00b skills can, meanwhile check it out http://pastebin.com/iF61b88U
19:20  gkatsev: ziyadb: have you read eloquent yet?
19:21  joo: >_<
19:21  joo: That exercise has nothing to do with what JS would really be used for
19:21  joo: Written by some intellectual in an ivory tower, no doubt
19:21  ziyadb: gkatsev haven't, no.
19:21  joo: ziyadb, well it depends what kind of inheritance model you're expected to use
19:22  joo: There would be a number of ways to implement that
19:22  ziyadb: its all noob stuff
19:22  ziyadb: something called "this"
19:22  joo: ...
19:22  joo: Well, of course you're going to use that
19:22  ziyadb: fail, I know.
19:22  joo: But I'm talking about slightly more subtle differences
19:23  ziyadb: here's an example on a similar? case, http://pastebin.com/arkt4DQQ
19:24  gkatsev: ziyadb: eloquent will teach you a lot about js.
19:25  ziyadb: gkatsev what sucks is, I'm a cisco guy and hate programming/scripting. I am doing this against my will.
19:25 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
19:25  ziyadb: but I guess it would be a good read. I'll look it up.
19:28  joo: ziyadb, here's something to start you off
19:28  joo: You should get the basic idea from that
19:28  joo: http://pastie.org/1356309
19:29  joo: Of course the "good programming style that helps readability part" probably means you should add comments
19:30  gkatsev: woot, js 1.8.5 gets Object.freeze! now, if only it had a built-in way to do deep-copy
19:32  l4rk: gkatsev: or unfreeze
19:32  l4rk: lol
19:34  pigdude: gkatsev: a deep copy fn is pretty easy to write
19:34  gkatsev: they do have unfreeze, lol
19:34  pigdude: gkatsev: write a merge fn, then copy = merge({}, o)
19:34  pigdude: gkatsev: as deep merge is actually what you have to write
19:34  gkatsev: pigdude: it is, but would've been nice if it was built-in because they could've uber-optimized it and what not.
19:34  pigdude: gkatsev: oh, definitely
19:35  pigdude: gkatsev: I just never trust the browser vendors :^D
19:35  gkatsev: lol
19:35  gkatsev: paranoid much?
19:35  pigdude: gkatsev: but maybe in a few years this'll be a thing of the past
19:35  pigdude: oh I don't mean I wouldn't use a built-in function
19:35  pigdude: I mean for the foreseeable future, this is something I have to define for many browsers
19:36  gkatsev: yeah
19:36  gkatsev: I currently use jquery as that is what is being used on the project
19:36  gkatsev: and I'm doing stuff like $.extend(true, {}, obj1, obj2) and $.extend(true, [], arr)
19:37  chmode: var	apppendTo = (item == 0)	? 'tab-'+tabid+'-itemtype-'+i :	'submenu-'+tabid+'-'+item;
19:37  chmode: is that valid?
19:38  gkatsev: why mixing tabs and spaces? but otherwise, looks valid.
19:38  gkatsev: chmode: try jslint.com
19:40  chmode: Error:

20:01  gkatsev: `document.write @ ziyadb_ // for future reference.
20:01  jsBot: ziyadb_: document.write: document.wrong. Please use something more modern and less prone to doing confusing things. Have a look at `html2dom and use that to turn the HTML you wish to output into modern DOM calls.
20:01  gkatsev: and other than having the html attrs in quotes, that looks fine
20:02  joo: dateLibrary.js...
20:02  joo: Can you post that too?
20:03  joo: Really you should use parseInt()
20:03  ziyadb_: give me a sec
20:03  joo: As none of those should be floating point numbers

20:04  ziyadb_: yep, I tried it out and it works, just wanted to make sure the correct functions and stuff like that are used.
20:04  joo: Oh god
20:04  ziyadb_: so I should replace all parsefloats with parseint?
20:04  joo: Whoever wrote that must have been more used to some other language than JS
20:04  joo: probably VB or something
20:04  joo: ziyadb_, yes.
20:05  ziyadb_: excellent. as of now it is fully functional, let me do that.
20:05  Gregor: Actually, only the first, fourth, fifth and sixth are ways of doing string->int, the rest are string->float.
20:05  joo: ziyadb_: *appears to be fully functional
20:05  gkatsev: Gregor: well, they are string->int as well.
20:06  joo: Other than that, yes, that seems fine.
20:06  Gregor: gkatsev: Only as the degenerate case :P
20:06  gkatsev: Gregor: good enough for me. :D
20:07  ziyadb_: joo just did and it is fully functional, awesome!
20:08  ziyadb_: now back to struggling with the accounting one.
20:11  dgEAPerez: hello... I'm still fighting with this: I´m creating a ul dinamically, inserting it into a div, then, when I "collapse" that div (modifying its height) the UL is still visible. The div height is changed, and in the DOM and HTML (via firebug) the UL is inside the div.. any help?
20:12  Gregor: dgEAPerez: Ask #css about the "overflow" property
20:12  dgEAPerez: tried with that, gregor... it doesn´t work
20:13  Gregor: OK, lesse some code.
20:13  dgEAPerez: for some reason, the ul is as it inside the div, but it "floats". If I do it in plain html, it works fine :S

22:21  inimino: carlocci ⋱ I'll send you the paypal address and once we get your sign-up fee we can start you on the paperwork.
22:21  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ It wasn't before.
22:22  gkatsev: weird
22:22  inimino: if Woosta is ever around you can ask him
22:22  inimino: or we can just switch to gbot2 eventually
22:22  gkatsev: yeah
22:23  gkatsev: but like for `console jsbot spits stuff out as well. And the url is using : which is even older than the old mdc right before it became mdn
22:23  inimino: I imported most of the jsBot into gbot2, it's just disabled so we don't spam the channel with duplicates.
22:24  inimino: s/the jsBot/the jsBot database/
22:24  gkatsev: ok
22:24  inimino: I actually just skimmed it from the logs
22:24  gkatsev: perhaps we should just kick jsbot and enable it?
22:25  gkatsev: or change jsBots char from ` to something else?
22:25  inimino: we also have `ref js, and `ref mdc now in gbot2, instead of the old MDC stuff in jsBot
22:25  f209: hi guys quick question, i have an exposed flash function in my flash document that i'm trying to reference with document.getElementById('FlashObject').functionName();
22:25  f209: this works great in IE
22:25  f209: and safari
22:25  f209: but not on chrome
22:25  f209: anyone know why?
22:25  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ well, I'd like to find out what some other people think before doing that.  Woosta is on occassionally, so someone should try to ask him, since jsBot is his bot.
22:25  gkatsev: inimino: yeah, the only thing that `js ref is better in jsbot over `ref js in gbot2 is that it gives the snippet about the command.
22:25  Gregor: `eval @ Gregor
22:25  jsBot: Gregor: eval: eval() is evil from both performance and design perspectives.  If eval() is the answer, chances are you're asking the wrong question (although there are a very few cases where it's useful) -- read http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/01/53329.aspx .  See `==== for an
22:25  jsBot: ..alternative.
22:26  youdontmeanmuch|: wooohoo https://chrome.google.com/webstore
22:26  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ Oh, yeah, that.
22:26  gkatsev: but the links are completely broken, so, there is no point
22:26  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ For that we'd need to spider MDC and add the snippet to the database, that's what jsBot had.
22:27  inimino: yeah, working links beat a nice summarry
22:27  inimino: summary, even
22:27  inimino: it would be nice if MDC had set up redirection
22:27  diamonds: geez is that closure bit considered a hack? onclick=function(v){ return function(){ alert(v);} }(foo)
22:27  diamonds: it certainly reads like one :/
22:27  gkatsev: inimino: yeah, I hate that MDC just goes to their front page as well when a page fails
22:28  inimino: diamonds ⋱ It's not at all a hack, but it might be bad style to write in on one line like that, depending on your taste.
22:28  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ Or a 404.
22:28  Gregor: diamonds: One of the benefits and disadvantages of JavaScript is that it has few, but powerful features. As a result, some things at the fringe of what it can (or was "meant") to do will end up using those features in unusual ways. Still better than stuffing an arseload of features into the language.
22:28 --- r0bby is now known as r0bby_
22:28 --- r0bby_ is now known as robbyoconnor
22:28  gkatsev: closure is awesome. It is also just a feature of functional languages with nested functions.
22:29  inimino: I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the fringe.
22:29  Gregor: I'm not saying that closures /in general/ are fringe.
22:29  diamonds: inimino: autorun this:(on click run this:( return a function that does what I need this parent to do))
22:29  diamonds: ^^just seems kinda wonky
22:29  Gregor: I'm saying that this particular example is sort of fringy (you're essentially using a closure to preserve a particular value of a loop index)
22:29  gkatsev: also, why is debugger; not advertised anywhere?
22:29  Gregor: gkatsev: Because it doesn't do shit on most implementations? :P
22:29  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ It's not really a lovely language feature.
22:30  gkatsev: works great in firebug, lol
22:30  jamesdotnet: diamonds: I think what you're doing is more-or-less called currying
22:30  diamonds: `currying
22:31  inimino: "debugger;" is a hack; real debuggers have breakpoints
22:31  inimino: diamonds ⋱ Read the first article in `closures
22:31  diamonds: inimino: tx
22:31  gkatsev: inimino: yeah, but I edit my js in vim and debug in firebug debugger; looks like the only way to enable a breakpoint in vim in a certain place
22:32  inimino: I'd say using closures as you're doing there, to capture local state, is one of the defining language features, not really an edge case.
22:32  gkatsev: It may be a hack but it is a very useful hack.
22:32  gkatsev: Can you even have a language with nested functions that does not have closures? Won't it break completely?
22:32  diamonds: inimino: yah.  Seems funny to autorun a function that returns a function that does what I'm trying to do.  Not a hack of course, but like I said, It reads funny :p
22:33  gkatsev: Oh, I guess you'd have to disable first class functions then
22:33  inimino: diamonds ⋱ I'd probably use a named function to construct the event handler if you think that doesn't read well.
22:33  diamonds: inimino: ok good Idea
22:33  diamonds: ty!
22:34  inimino: it can be declared locally, and at the end of the enclosing function
22:34  inimino: `ref mdc functions
22:34  v8bot: inimino: Function - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function
22:34  jamesdotnet: gkatsev: I believe C and C++ (maybe only some dialects) have nested functions without closure
22:34  Gregor: inimino: But here it's being used to /replicate/ transient local state, not just capture local state (which is just the definition of a closure)
22:34  gkatsev: jamesdotnet: only in GCC, but you cannot pass the nested functions to other places
22:35  gkatsev: jamesdotnet: aka, not first class functions.
22:35  f209: anyone experience an issue where swfobject does not work in chrome
22:35  inimino: C does not have nested functions.
22:35  inimino: right, except as an extension
22:36  inimino: Gregor ⋱ Well, it's necessary to add a closure to prevent the feature (of access to the local scope) from interfering with what's desired.

22:51  diamonds: wat
22:51  diamonds: ironmagma: solved
22:51  diamonds: thank you
22:51  ironmagma: why you using document.links when you're using jquery?
22:52  ironmagma: $("a") does the same thing
22:52  diamonds: ironmagma: well I wasn't using jquery for that
22:52  diamonds: I did have jquery loaded...
22:53  diamonds: anyway would that have fixed my closure issue?
22:53  ironmagma: I think it would make your loop more concise
22:53  inimino: jQuery has nothing to do with your closure issue.
22:53  ironmagma: $("a").each()
22:54  ironmagma: instead of the for loop
22:54  ironmagma: dunno what closure issue you speak of

22:57  pigdude: yea because the *monkey stuff out of mozilla was going so slowly
22:57  pigdude: amazing what google has accomplished
22:57  inimino: slowly?
22:58  pigdude: inimino: relatively speaking, and I am referring to development
22:58  inimino: http://www.arewefastyet.com/
22:58  inimino: It's been going pretty damn fast if you ask me.
22:58  pigdude: inimino: I don't think many would debate that google has had a huge impact on js engine dev since v8 came out
22:59  inimino: pigdude ⋱ Sure.
22:59  pigdude: I'm not saying the mozilla guys aren't working hard too :^)
22:59  pigdude: google has greater resources
22:59  pigdude: s/greater/more
22:59  inimino: yes
22:59  ironmagma: inimino: why do you use ⋱ instead of just a colon?
22:59  pigdude: ironmagma: to thwart us
22:59  gkatsev: ironmagma: because he can
22:59  ironmagma: inimino: isn't that a pain to type? :P
23:00  pigdude: prolly a client setting
23:00  gkatsev: tab completion ftw
23:00  inimino: yep
23:00  pigdude: inimino: which client? I couldn't track it down in xhcat (and of course not in limechat)
23:00  inimino: weechat
23:00  peeps[lappy]: pigdude, it's in xchat
23:00  pigdude: thanks, I'll have to try that out
23:01  gkatsev: weechat not irssi?
23:01  inimino: yes
23:01  pigdude: peeps[lappy]: some things are so well-hidden :^)
23:01  gkatsev: inimino: any particular reason?
23:01  pigdude: peeps[lappy]: particularly in that aoo
23:01  pigdude: *app
23:01  inimino: gkatsev ⋱ no, not really
23:01  peeps[lappy]: settings -> preferences -> input box -> nick completion
23:06  peeps[lappy]: i've been kinda wanting to switch to weechat, but i'm too accustomed to xchat.
23:08  ironmagma: http://www.trillian.im/ I like the huge form elements.
23:09  gkatsev: irssi ftw
23:09  _sudo: I <3 irssi
23:11  EvanR-work: no irssi is terrible!
23:11  EvanR-work: i cant even figure out how to exit from it! (tm)
23:11  gkatsev: you're terrible
23:11  gkatsev: /quit
23:11  EvanR-work: im joking
23:11  gdoteof: what is the proper way to check document.getElementByID('..');  to make sure it does not return null before invoking something on that element?\
23:12  preaction: var elem = document.getelementById('...'); if ( elem ) { ... }
23:12  gdoteof: thats ugly
23:12  preaction: why
23:12  gdoteof: cus elem isn't being used
23:12  gdoteof: or i guess it could be
23:13  EvanR-work: gkatsev: thats way too complex! i had to hard reboot
23:13  blu3sy: Ari-Ugwu need to open distant file ?
23:13  ironmagma: var elem; if((elem = document.getElementById('…')) !== null) { blah }
23:13  gkatsev: gdoteof: elem is used in that if.
23:13  gdoteof: i guess i could just do if(document.getelementById(..))
23:13  gdoteof: ok that makes sense
23:13  inimino: ...?
23:13  ironmagma: gdoteof: then you waste time getting the element twice
23:14  preaction: gdoteof: so you'd rather type out document.getElementById twice?
23:14  inimino: If it isn't being used, it's rare that you would need to test for it.
23:14  gdoteof: ok ok you guys are right. but what if i am not using elem in there
23:14  peeps[lappy]: then you don't need to test for it
23:14  inimino: then that's fine
23:15  gdoteof: peeps[lappy]: not true necessarily.  i might need to see if its there to dosomething in some other element
23:15  peeps[lappy]: thats ugly
23:15  ironmagma: your lack of punctuation is ugly
23:16  gdoteof: well i am using the assignment
23:17 * ecto says hi
23:17  blu3sy: hiw can i get a distant file using javascript please?
23:18  inimino: "distant"?
23:18  peeps[lappy]: i think he means remote
23:18  ironmagma: (1) connect to satellite (2) send xhr
23:18  EvanR-work: if voyager can do it, so can you
23:21  blu3sy: inimino yes
23:21  inimino: ...
23:21  blu3sy: remote same meaning
23:21  inimino: blu3sy ⋱ What does "distant" mean?
23:21  inimino: What does "remote" mean?
23:21  peeps[lappy]: not on his own server presumably
23:21 --- dgathright_ is now known as dgathright
23:21  blu3sy: peeps that it
23:21  peeps[lappy]: as opposed to a local file
23:21  blu3sy: any one to help?
23:21  gkatsev: `xhr
23:21  jsBot: xhr: http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XMLHttpRequest , http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html , www.jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html , www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/
23:21  vacuoustruth: ironmagma:lol
23:22  NoiseEee: <a href='http://othersite/otherfile'>get the remote file!</a>
23:23  _sudo: bye
23:24  ecto: sudo lol
23:42 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
23:50  echosystm: any websocket/comet guns here?
23:50  echosystm: i need some advice on how to best write some software where all clients are completely synchronized
23:51  echosystm: ie. if one client has failed to receive some updates, then it should not be able to make changes to the database
23:53  echosystm: but in the same token, i dont want the clients to receive updates they aren't interested in, because it would use an insane amount of bandwidth
