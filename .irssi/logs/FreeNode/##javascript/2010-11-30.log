09:10  alcuadrado: zomg, interesting book
09:11  alcuadrado: I have just bought the "java version" by Beck
09:11  zomg: Yep, seems pretty interesting even though I'm already somewhat familiar with TDD in JS
09:11  zomg: Quick skim reveals it had a small chapter about TDD in Node.js apps too
09:12  alcuadrado: oh, so it must be a very recent book
09:13  zomg: Yeah it is perhaps month or two old tops :)

10:31  petisnnake: How can I check if a node is an unordered list element?
10:32  cojack: unordered?
10:33  cojack: everythink is ordrered, in some way
10:33  TheSheep: tagName
10:33  TheSheep: of the parent node
10:34  petisnnake: thanks TheSheep
10:34  cojack: TheSheep: what those mean unordered?
10:36  Maxdamantus: Took me a while, but I think he means <ul>
10:40 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
10:54  cojack: Maxdamantus: and how li in ul can be unsorted? ;p
10:54  cojack: unordered *
10:55  Maxdamantus: afaik, "ul" stands for "unordered list"
10:58 * cojack give up, don't understand
10:59  Maxdamantus: document.createElement("ul") is a ul element.
10:59  Maxdamantus: document.createElement("ul") is an unordered list element.
11:06  sac: cojack, unordered in ul only means that there is no reason why the list items are in the order that they are in. ol means that the items are in that order for a reason
11:07  sac: reasoning may vary
11:08  sac: for example <ul class="contestants"><li>cojack</li><li>sac</li></ul> vs. <ol class="winners"><li>sac</li><li>cojack</li></ol>
11:25  carlossotelo_: hello maybe a offtic
11:25  carlossotelo_: I have a tinymce editot....
11:25  carlossotelo_: well
11:25  carlossotelo_: two tinycme editor
11:25  carlossotelo_: and one button
11:26  carlossotelo_: clicking on button, content of first editor must be paste on the second.. are there a way.... thanks
11:40  dr_traktor: Can I force JS to call a function with variable passing instead of reference passing?
11:42  dr_traktor: I'm trying to create content dependent onclick functionality but by the time I click the referenced variable doesn't exist anymore. I need to convert its content to string and pass that as a string.
11:43  Maxdamantus: What do you mean by the variable not existing?
11:43  dr_traktor: It's content is changed at least.
11:43  Maxdamantus: Unless the "variable" refers to a property of an object (global, or with with) it can't not exist .
11:45  olivvv_: Hi, to test if a given element is in the dom, do I have to check recursively until i find window ?
11:45  Cork: olivvv_: if an element exist or a parent?
11:46  Maxdamantus: dr_traktor: Javascript only has value passing.
11:46  dr_traktor: Okay, there are a bunch of elements with unique ids generated by a simple rule with JS. How would you display the name of that id in an onclick event?
11:46  Maxdamantus: dr_traktor: The value of an object just happens to be a reference-like thing.
11:46  dr_traktor: Maxdamantus: thanks for clearing that.
11:46  dr_traktor: Still it behaves like a reference.
11:47  Maxdamantus: this.id?
11:48  dr_traktor: Maxdamantus: that works.
11:48  Maxdamantus: Are you sure this is to do with object passing?
11:48  Maxdamantus: Maybe it's to do with the funny static scoping.
11:49  dr_traktor: I was thinking about using the same handler function with different arguments per object.
11:49 * Maxdamantus learnt `let` is meant to be introduced after ES5
11:49  dr_traktor: That would have been cooler.
11:49  Maxdamantus: Maybe if you could show some example code, I'm not sure what you mean.
11:50  olivvv_: Cork:if it exists in the dom
11:51  jamesdotnet: olivvv_: You can narrow it down but generally if it doesn't have a name/id/class then you're stuck traversing the dom
11:51  Cork: olivvv_: document.findElementById or document.findElementByName
11:51  Maxdamantus: I'd imagine there'd be a better way to test that.
11:51  olivvv_: Cork: I have the element, but no idea if it has a class or an id
11:52  Maxdamantus: If not, you could try .clientWidth > 0
11:52  Maxdamantus: assuming it's not hidden
11:52  Maxdamantus: (and isn't all clipped away)
11:52  olivvv_: Maxdamantus:interesting
11:53  olivvv_: Maxdamantus:looks great, because I want to make sure that the element is available, so it has to be not hidden as well
11:53  Cork: (oops meant getELement not find :x)
11:53  olivvv_: I ll try that after lunch, thanks a lot
11:59  dr_traktor: Maxdamantus: Well I wrote some code just now but it's jquery so I might be off topic here. I also getting sort of an answer in #jquery.
11:59  dr_traktor: An answer like "it can't be done".
11:59 * Maxdamantus doesn't really know jQuery anyway.
12:03  _Reecieboy: elseif or else if
12:05  Maxdamantus: afaik elseif is invalid.
12:05  Maxdamantus: else if makes perfect sense.
12:05  Maxdamantus: It's just a `if` inside an `else`
12:06  Maxdamantus: elseif introduces another one of those silly infinite-length set of clauses.
12:06  Maxdamantus: Like catch.
12:08  _Reecieboy: got ya -> http://pastebin.com/kegRHMhb cant figure out why that returns false on passwordCheck, view -> http://208.86.154.112/~projekt/#
12:08  buubot: _Reecieboy:  The 62 line paste kegRHMhb has been copied to   .
12:08  _Reecieboy: (the 2nd function is it being called)
12:10  Maxdamantus: _Reecieboy: because it's not inside the `else` clause as you seem to think.
12:10  Maxdamantus: else { alert("here"); } success = false;
12:10  Maxdamantus: So it's going to be false regardless.
12:11  _Reecieboy: O.O im not seeing what ur seeing.
12:12  Maxdamantus: `else alert("here");` is always the same as `else { alert("here"); }`
12:13  _Reecieboy: oh shit i didnt encapsulate it
12:14  coda^: firebug 1.6 seems ok - first time in a while for a new release that does not break horridly

12:15  Segaja: sadly 1.7alpha does not work that well on FF4
12:15  Segaja: yet :)

13:02  binni: Is it possible to code a canvas arc() that does the same and is as fast as the canvas arc? And is there any way to see the underlying code of canvas arc?
13:09  Sorella: binni ≣ it is possible to code a canvas arc() that does the same thing as the native one, but making it as fast would probably be tricky (JITed code over some layers vs Native one). W3C probably has some pointers on the implementation of `arc', but I don't think you can get the native code for the various implementations, unless they are open-source, in which case you just have to find the engine's source and look at it.
13:11  binni: Sorella: any idea how much slower it would be without any trickery?
13:12 --- mauke_ is now known as mauke
13:14  temoto: Hello. What's the proper way to set form.enctype in IE?
13:15  temoto: form.enctype = ... doesn't work, obviously
13:22  Sorella: binni ≣ that would depend a lot on your implementation and the JavaScript engine running it. I think it could be reasonable fast in Nitro, v8 and probably JM and Carakan too. Not sure how Chakra stands out here. Bezier curves should make it pretty fast, I guess?
13:22  Sorella: temoto ≣ maybe form.setAttribute("enctype", "text/plain")?
13:22  binni: Sorella: alrighty, thanks. :)
13:22  Sorella: where `form` is a reference to the actual form element.
13:33  temoto: Sorella, thanks, i guess setting attribute works, but it doesn't send data in proper way.
13:34  temoto: I'm settings enctype to multipart/form-data just before form.submit

13:44  jgeerdes: littlegirl: You'll have to do something like document.getElementById('MYDIV').getElementsByTagName('a') and then loop through the resulting element array
13:45  littlegirl: jgeerdes: Thanks, although I tried doing something like that, but must not have the syntax correct.

14:49  NuLLBiT: Is it possible to access the DOM of an iframe from the main HTML?
14:53  frio80: NuLLBiT: Only if the iframe is in the same domain as the "main HTML"
14:53  NuLLBiT: Its in different domain
14:54  NuLLBiT: frio80, so is it possible to generate click event on a link in iframe?
14:55  frio80: NuLLBiT: Do you ahve control over both pages, "main HTML" and iframe?
14:55  NuLLBiT: no, I have control over only the main HTML page
14:55  Maxdamantus: NuLLBiT: then no, it's not.
14:56  frio80: NuLLBiT: There's not much you can do.  You can't access content from different domains.
14:57  NuLLBiT: frio80, so why doesn't paypal show a button with cost in an iframe and confirm transaction as soon as I press the button instead of having to redirect to paypal page?
14:58  NuLLBiT: frio80, is there a security concern if they do it like that
14:58  Maxdamantus: NuLLBiT: yes, phishing.
14:58  Maxdamantus: (Sort of)
14:58  TheSheep: NuLLBiT: yes, you could display your own web page in there then, looking like the paypal one
14:58  Maxdamantus: ^
14:58  Maxdamantus: iframes tend not to have URL bars.
14:59  Maxdamantus: and most users probably don't know where to find the actual URL of an iframe.
14:59  Maxdamantus: But everyone's always being told these days to look at the URL when you log in to something.
14:59  frio80: NuLLBiT: Not sure I completely understand the question.  Hope these other guys answered it for you
15:00  NuLLBiT: TheSheep, what if they allow to set a background for the user's paypal page. So its impossible for the website to make it look like their paypal?
15:00  Maxdamantus: He was saying that you must be able to interact with an iframe, because paypal doesn't let you add an iframe for their site on your site.
15:01  Maxdamantus: It could be a scam site which is meant to look like a game that lets you exchange money.
15:02  NuLLBiT: Maxdamantus, I didn't get that
15:04  Wizek: How do I check wheter an Object is empty?
15:04  Maxdamantus: Fake money.
15:04  frio80: Maxdamantus: Gotcha.  Usually, Paypal just takes you to their domain to make payments.  I'd be suspicious if it didn't work like that (unless you're using the API which lets you integrate directly on your site)
15:04  Maxdamantus: Imagine it's sort of like an online monopoly.
15:05  Maxdamantus: Hm, that might be difficult.
15:05  Maxdamantus: Unless you can find a way to make the banker secretly take your real money before you play.
15:05  Maxdamantus: (and add it to the stacks of fake money)
15:06  NuLLBiT: What if paypal allowed users to choose a custom background image for their paypal page and then showed this image along with the price in an iframe on the seller's webpage. You can then know for sure that, the iframe is coming from paypal since it has the background image you set on paypal.com settings.
15:06  NuLLBiT: That way user experience can be improved?
15:13  AnthonyCat: Hi, I want to write some code that parses a date string. I want it to return a time period though. For example, "Jan 1, 2010" would be a range holding that day. Whereas "Jan 1, 2010 8:00pm" would return a range that starts at Jan 1, 2010 8:00pm and ends at Jan 1, 2010 8:01pm. How can I do this?
15:14  frio80: NuLLBiT: Paypal allows you to integrate their services directly into your website.  You dont have to use the iframe solution.
15:14  frio80: i think its called Website Payments Pro or PayFlow Pro
15:14  NuLLBiT: frio80, and the user is not redirected to the paypal page?
15:15  frio80: Correct

15:19  Wizek: frio80: :D but thanks for the warning
15:20  frio80: Wizek: I wish I had your job!  You get to use all the cool aspects of the language.
15:21  frio80: NuLLBiT:  So, you want them to use their Paypal account on your site w/o leaving?  Is that the request?
15:21  NuLLBiT: frio80, exactly!
15:24  frio80: NuLLBiT: Gotcha.  Yeah, dont think you can do that one.  People use Paypal to avoid entering information directly into the site.  Whenever I've implemented, using Paypal always takes you off the site
15:24  iaj: lo there
15:25  NuLLBiT: yeah, I know that but if paypal implements the above idea I mentioned won't it be really useful for users?
15:25  iaj: I got a problem - document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0] is undefined  - that's what I get :\ shouldn't that work on all pages?
15:26  frio80: NuLLBiT: So, how would Paypal alert your 'main HTML' page that the request was successful and you should be brought to the 'Thank You'
15:27  frio80: NuLLBiT: Sorry, hit enter to fast.  I mean, there's not way for Paypal to communicate with yoru page to say 'Hey, I'm done.  Let's move the user to the Thank You page now'
15:27  NuLLBiT: Thats what I came to ask here
15:28  frio80: NuLLBiT: It all makes sense now... :)

16:32  Teycho: again, no. it's very situational. some solutions may work well for your situation, others may be horrible
16:32  Teycho: or the opposite for another situation
16:32  Teycho: And since you've given no details...

17:26  davetarmac: yeah
17:26  Sorella: davetarmac ≣ there doesn't seem to be anything wrong javascript-wise. But we dunno what the function does, how it expects the parameters to be passed and important stuff like that. I suggest you looking at the documentation of that script, asking on the forums/mailing lists (if any) or the script's author directly.
17:26  djmccorm1ck: i need to do some local debugging on some pages and i'm getting cross domain restrictions on my dev machine through chrome and firefox. with firefox i see i'd need the server to send special headers (not possible for me) or to use greasemonkey scripts. is there any known solution to bypassing this for debugging only for firefox, chrome, or safari without modifying headers or using something like greasemonkey?
17:28  Sorella: djmccorm1ck ≣ in Chrome you can run it using --allow-file-access-from-files (or something like that, you'll probably have to look at the source code), I think you can toggle the Furryfox policies in the about:config
17:28  Sorella: otherwise, you could set a quick local server using Node.js/lighttpd/something
17:29  davetarmac: ok, thanks for the help
17:29  davetarmac: it did look right to me too - but my js is very limited
17:29  djmccorm1ck: Sorella: thank you, that gives me somewhere to start searching. i don't think a local server will be possible unless it's just a proxy of some kind since it's a whole REST api i'm integrating.

18:21  Pilum: Lo.
18:23  coder7of9: i would like some advice on an issue i am encountering. to implement page by page navigation through a form i am updating a div with html received via an ajax call. immediately after the update a call is made to execute the onclick handler of the first element in a specified div. the issue is that the innerHTML is correct however a call to the onclick handler returns the onclick handler for a field in teh previous page which is now suppose to have bee
18:23  coder7of9: is thsi a known issue?
18:24  NoiseEee: there is no 'previous page'
18:24  NoiseEee: if you're on the same page, its the same page.  the handlers are all still there.
18:24  coder7of9: the html which existed before the ajax update
18:24  NoiseEee: it doesnt matter
18:24  js_: is it possible to make a file upload field look any way i want? so i can just click my custom icon to get the file browse window
18:24  NoiseEee: its the same script. the handlers are there in memory just waitin'
18:25  Pilum: It's still not a distinct page. :-)
18:25  NoiseEee: js_: google
18:25  js_: NoiseEee: been doing it for a while
18:25  NoiseEee: js_: either way the answer would have nothing to do with JS.  try #css.
18:26  js_: NoiseEee: cool, thanks
18:26  Gregor: js_: For what it's worth, it's not. Browsers are very careful to make file upload boxes look very clearly distinct so that users can't be fooled into accidentally uploading files.
18:26  coder7of9: so despite doing a targetDiv.innerHTML=ajaxHTML the now replaced fields persist?
18:26  NoiseEee: coder7of9: they do in memory.  you need to remove the event observers on elements that no longer exist.
18:27  coder7of9: if the events are created inline, <input... onclick...> this would be a task?
18:27  NoiseEee: yeah that would be a great reason not to use inline scripting.
18:28  coder7of9: ok you offered some valuable insight
18:28  coder7of9: thank you

18:55  Sorella: yeah, null is an object
18:55  Pilum: So? That's not something you delete. You null it.
18:55  Wes: Pilum: Why?
18:56  Pilum: Because it's not truly a property, it's an event.
18:56  Sorella: oh, you're talking specifically about nulling the onload...
18:56  Wes: Pilum: No, it's a property on a host object which is invoked as a function when an event occurs
18:57  EvanR-work: what are js properties, *really* ? ;)
18:57  EvanR-work: discuss
18:57  Pilum: More like a pointer to a function.
18:58  Wes: EvanR-work: The more interesting question is "what is a method"

18:58  NoiseEee: is a rose a rose if it wasnt read or some shit like that?

19:01  Avi`: and before yo uexit the method you want to make sure you popSetting()
19:01  Avi`: but if you are returning from say, 7 different paths, you have to call popSetting() before each return
19:01  Avi`: is there some way you could setup something so whenever the scope of the calling method ended
19:01  Avi`: popSetting() would get called?

19:02  TheSheep: Avi`: you could wrap your scope in a function that does it...
19:02  Wes: EvanR-work: Which API?
19:02  Avi`: TheSheep: yeah but that feels crazy
19:02  Avi`: to wrap the whole function up in another function just to pop it
19:03  Avi`: well, i mean, that doesn't seem like a good thing to expose righht in your code
19:03  Wes: Avi`: finally clause of a try block maybe?
19:03  Avi`: could do try/catch/finally (popSetting)
19:03  TheSheep: Avi`: but that's what the computer would do anyways, right?
19:06  Avi`: TheSheep: basically like this, like function() { pushTimeout(); function() { all my code }; popTimeout() } ?

20:47  petisnnake: carlocci: any hints?
20:47  gkatsev: gbot2: string->int = v8: [parseInt('1', 10), Number('1'), +'1', ~~'1', '1'>>0, '1'|0, 1*'1'] // each item in the list is a way of doing string->int conversions

20:51  carlocci: I wouldn't suggest binary operators to convert to int
20:52  gkatsev: whoa, why did I not know of firerainbow? http://firerainbow.binaryage.com/
20:52  carlocci: because of the 32 bit limitation and because it's not `string->int tricks
20:54  Sorella: well, int's are supposed to be 32 bits...
20:55  gkatsev: more often than not, you don't need ints larger than 32bits
20:55  gkatsev: you being the collective you
20:55 * Sorella prefers +'001' at any rate. Safe and sweet.
20:55  Sorella: unless you're using an addition just before it...
20:56  carlocci: Sorella, what?
20:56  Sorella: v8> 1+ +'001';
20:56  v8bot: Sorella: 2
20:56  Sorella: v8> 2+ +'101';

20:56  gbot2: gkatsev: [1.2345566777532124e+42,0]
20:57  Sorella: or do unary + has precedence over addition operations?
20:58  carlocci: yes
20:58  carlocci: unary +/- take the precedence
20:58  gkatsev: problem is if you forget the extra +
20:58  Sorella: I see
20:58  gkatsev: js> 2+ '101'
20:58  gbot2: gkatsev: "2101"
20:58  gkatsev: unary ops usually bind tighter than other ops
20:59  petisnnake: how can I check if a proprieties tagName == null, without getting a console error if it's not? if(e.tagName == null) obviously doesnt work because if e is null the exception will occur
21:00  gkatsev: e && e.tagName == null
21:00  petisnnake: im so idiotic today, thanks!
21:00  gkatsev: :)
21:00  gkatsev: technically, you can do just e && !e.tagName
21:00  gkatsev: assuming tagName wont be 0
21:01  gkatsev: js> !''
21:01  gbot2: gkatsev: true
21:01  gkatsev: or an empty string
21:05  carlocci: or undefined?
21:07  Sorella: == null is basically (x === null || x === undefined)

22:59  jsBot: gz0: eval: eval() is evil from both performance and design perspectives.  If eval() is the answer, chances are you're asking the wrong question (although there are a very few cases where it's useful) -- read http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/01/53329.aspx .

23:33  Sorella: `minimal @ WebNickel
23:33  gbot2: WebNickel: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
23:33  blip-: Sorella, ah ok, I'd have to learn it though, i'm kind of in a hurry to finish this today.  I'm more familiar with Java, C, Python and PHP.  which do you recommend from these ?
23:33  Sorella: blip- ≣ go for Python. It has nice stdlibs for that.
23:34  Sorella: you could do it in Java if you're confortable writing it too, since there's also a lib for that.
23:34 * Sorella shrugs
23:35  gkatsev: ugh, stupid windows :(
23:36  gkatsev: python dictionaries are almost JSON
23:36  blip-: Sorella, ok I'll go for Java since I'm on windows right now and can't be bothered to boot to Linux :)
23:36  gkatsev: python works on windows, blip-
23:37  blip-: ye but it feels wrong to set it up on windows somehow :)
23:37  blip-: Out of place or such
23:37  Sorella: why? D:
23:37  EvanR-work: python dictionary, string, 'list', numbers, and bools could represent a json
23:37  EvanR-work: and None
23:37  Sorella: python has a JSON library, methinks
23:37  gkatsev: it does
23:38  blip-: hmm
23:38  gkatsev: i believe it converts the JSON into python dicts
23:38  gkatsev: there is a JSON .parse & .stringify for python
23:38  EvanR-work: hopefully converts this json "\"json\"" into a string
23:38  gjvc: i'm using jquery to make rest queries
23:38  gjvc: json.dumps( object ) and object = json.loads( string )
23:39  Sorella: working with JSON in Genie is wierd.
23:39  gkatsev: `jquery @ gjvc
23:39  jsBot: gjvc: jquery: For help with jquery, try: #jquery
23:39  Sorella: since it's basically the JSON from glib-c .-.
23:40  EvanR-work: glib? or g-libc
23:41  Sorella: glib
23:42  blip-: alright then, I will read more about JSON then look into this Python abilities.  thanks for the help everyone :)
23:42  Sorella: EvanR-work ≣ http://valadoc.org/json-glib-1.0/index.html ← this one
23:42  gkatsev: json.org, at least 4 python implementations
23:43 * EvanR-work goes outside and slaps a 'also: JSON' sign on the channel 
23:43  maushu: JSON will set you free!
23:43  gkatsev: EvanR-work: is there a #json channel?
23:43  Sorella: also, glib functions are so freaking Java-like .-.
23:43  blip-: gkatsev, thanks
23:43  EvanR-work: Sorella: uhg, c++-like C ;)
23:44  Sorella: I haven't done C++ yet
23:44  EvanR-work: i think its even worse
23:46  EvanR-work: oh this is vala
23:47 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:47  gkatsev: I guess i'll have to stick to no unicode
23:48  EvanR-work: uhg it does reference counting
23:48  gkatsev: :(
23:48  EvanR-work: gkatsev: what os, client, DE?
23:48  gkatsev: windows, KiTTY
23:48  EvanR-work: oh
23:48  EvanR-work: that explains it
23:48  gkatsev: I have fonts that support unicode
23:48  gkatsev: but they are all ugly as shit
23:48  EvanR-work: im sure you do
23:49  EvanR-work: try inserting your unicode support service pack CD-ROM from microsoft
23:49  gkatsev: and I installed dejavu sans mono, but it doesn't support all of unicode either
23:49  gkatsev: EvanR-work: should be installed.
23:49  EvanR-work: nothing supports 'all unicode'
23:49  gkatsev: by all unicode, i mean, the chars from above
23:49  EvanR-work: you *should* be using a collection of fonts that provide nice glyphs for each language you are interested in
23:49  EvanR-work: i dont know if windows supports that kind of mix and match rendering through
23:49  EvanR-work: though
23:49  gkatsev: unfortunately, KiTTY/PuTTY doesn't provide that functionality
23:50  gkatsev: yeah
23:50  EvanR-work: like fontconfig does on linux
23:50  Sorella: gkatsev ≣ have you tried the Ubuntu font?
23:50  Sorella: or doesn't it have support for unicode?
23:51  gkatsev: I have tried the ubuntu font, but I have tried dejavu
23:51  Sorella: EvanR-work ≣ yeah, objects work by reference counting. Although you can use Structs directly, so you get to manage memory yourself.
23:51  SamuraiDio: hi, do someone know a way to remove accents from string with a single regex?
23:51  EvanR-work: Sorella: i certainly dont want to manage the memory myself
23:52  EvanR-work: but i also dont see a problem with cyclic data
23:53  Sorella: EvanR-work ≣ well, if you need to create lots of objects within a short period of time, you would have to use Structs, since GObjects take quite awhile to allocate.
23:53  Sorella: EvanR-work ≣ you can use weak references for cyclic data.
23:53  Sorella: so it doesn't counts towards the refcount
23:53  gjvc: gkatsev, thankyou; already aware :-)
23:53  EvanR-work: thats trash
23:54  EvanR-work: the expensive allocate thing
23:54  EvanR-work: SamuraiDio: you can remove apostrophes easily. unicode regex char classes are not supported
23:55  EvanR-work: any real unicode processing is not provided by default and you need a library
23:55  Sorella: I think there's a lightweight implementation of the GObjects, used by GStream or something. But the ones in GLib are pretty bloated.
23:56  AZ2: i can't make these four lines of code work (4 lines includes curly braces) http://pastebin.com/UpRnHmZP
23:57  AZ2: it is just a simple div that alerts the embedded id
23:57  Sorella: AZ2 ≣ you have to quote the selector string
23:58  AZ2: $(".sq").click(function() {  so that should work
