13:17  Tricks: is there a return keyword?
13:17  Tricks: or anything like that?
13:19  ronnie_vd_c: Tricks: depends on what module you use for Ajax.request (i thought this was not standard js)

13:20  Tricks: i think I'm using prototype
13:20  ronnie_vd_c: for my projects, i use jQuery as a js framework. There is is very easy
13:20  ronnie_vd_c: prototype... ill have a look at the documentation
13:20  Tricks: ronnie_vd_c, ok I'll use jquery then :) there's alot more info on jquery and everybody seems to rave about it :)
