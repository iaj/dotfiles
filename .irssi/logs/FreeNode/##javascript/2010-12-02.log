16:41  compaq: anyone know how to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/69Y3t/ cause what it does is not what is intended.
16:41  paxcoder: if i set .className to something, shouldn't whatever is in that class override everything else for that element?

16:53 --- fg-- is now known as fg-
16:54  fg-: if i have data as {id: '551'} and i want to do something like for (param in data) { } how can i use the param to get the id? would be something like data.<param>
16:56  molgrew: data[param]
16:56  fg-: i didn't know i could do that
16:56  fg-: let me check
16:56  Teycho: you're trying to get 'id' from '551' ?
16:56  fg-: yes, to get data.id
16:57  gkatsev: fg-: objects in js can be accessed either via dot notation or bracket (array) notation.
16:57  fg-: but i was trying to create a generic function
16:58  paxcoder: molgrew, yeah, i don't get it.
16:59  fg-: thanks a lot molgrew, Teycho, gkatsev
16:59  fg-: works perfect
16:59  paxcoder: all i know is it doesn't work
17:01  molgrew: what rules are involved?
17:04  paxcoder: molgrew, parent is of class .odd li:nth-child(odd){}, and child's className gets set onmouseover  to .focus {}. Each of the mentioned sets a background-color, but for odd children, the former takes precedence.
17:04  paxcoder: *the effect is that only even children get background changed by the focus class.
17:06  paxcoder: molgrew, i can change it setting .odd li:hover to what focus is (probably will), but that won't make me any smarter
17:10  kicken: paxcoder, you could probably add ! important to the .focus class and it'd work.  :hover seems like the way to go though.
17:11  molgrew: well, according to the calculation algorithm, the ".odd li:nth-child(odd)" selector is more specific than ".focus"
17:11  AnthonyCat: Say I have <div id="a"><div id="b"></div></div>. When I click b, I want alert(b), when I click a, i want alert("a"), but when I click b, i get alert("a") and alert("b"). How can I fix this to just get b in this case?
17:11  paxcoder: kicken, wow, thanks for the tip! i learned something.
17:11  kicken: .odd li:nth-child has a specifity of 0012 if I calculate right.  .focus is 0010
17:11  paxcoder: molgrew, thanks. it's... .odd ;-)
17:13  eMyller: AnthonyCat: stop the event propagation.
17:13  AnthonyCat: eMyller: how?
17:13  gkatsev: return false
17:13  eMyller: .stopPropagation.
17:14  eMyller: `events @ AnthonyCat
17:14  jsBot: AnthonyCat: events: http://onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/chapter4.html   www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_events.html   www.quirksmode.org/js/events_tradmod.html
17:14  gkatsev: or event.stopPropagation
17:14  MrNibbles: evening gents
17:14  eMyller: gkatsev: why 'return false'?
17:14  eMyller: it works for inline/old style events only.
17:14  gkatsev: eMyller: that stops the propagation of the event, at least it should, as far as I know.
17:15  eMyller: not for event listeners -- i'm assuming AnthonyCat will do us the favor to use them
17:15  AnthonyCat: I'm using addEventListener
17:15  eMyller: great start.
17:15  AnthonyCat: it only does it once now, but It does the outer event first
17:16  AnthonyCat: I want to get the inner event
17:17  gkatsev: eMyller: old/inline like el.onclick = function(){}?
17:17  kicken: AnthonyCat, check the event's target and make sure it's the element you want.  if it's not, ignore it
17:17  Luis450: help
17:18  eMyller: gkatsev: yes.
17:18  AnthonyCat: kicken: ok, my example was too simple. There are other things in the div. But this should work somehow.
17:18  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: the point stands.  query the event to find out the element it happened on; if its something you care about, fire a handler
17:18  eMyller: AnthonyCat: can you handle the event object? test your target
17:19  AnthonyCat: eMyller: I get the target
17:19  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: in face, taken to the next level, this is called 'event delegation' and by using this method, you can have minimal (single?) event listeners in memory, and you determine the callback by querying the event
17:19  NoiseEee: s/in face/in fact
17:19  Luis450: im a senior manager working with several firms on mobile JS for iPad, iPhone and other mobile devices. Does anyone know of resources that can help with the development?
17:19  NoiseEee: no need to put a listener on everything in the div; just put a single one on the div, and query the event.
17:20  AnthonyCat: NoiseEee: good idea
17:20  AnthonyCat: so could I just take my target, and keep doing .parentNode until I get what i want?
17:20  NoiseEee: Luis450: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript http://eloquentjavascript.net/
17:21  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: more the reverse.  google about "event delegation"
17:21  gkatsev: eMyller: and it only works for those? ok, good to know. Thanks.
17:21  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: when you add an event listener, the 'event' object holds the DOM element it fired on
17:21  AnthonyCat: NoiseEee: you are talking about the target?
17:22  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: yes
17:22  NoiseEee: AnthonyCat: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/06/30/event-delegation-in-javascript/
17:23  Luis450: Thanks
17:25  bLiNdRaGe: quick question, I'm looking over my senior exam topics, and this is really bland, which google doesn't like
17:25  bLiNdRaGe: all it says is: "Using type adds in Javascript"
17:25  bLiNdRaGe: does that mean creating types in javascript?
17:26  dwarder: i want to split text into an array, separator must be new line sign, how can i do this? what sign to use?
17:27  dwarder: \n ?
17:27  dwarder: $^ ?
17:27  gkatsev: dwarder: str.split('\n'); it also accepts regex if you wish
17:27  eMyller: dwarder: what kind of new line is it?
17:28  dwarder: eMyller: source is textarea, when user hits enter
17:28  eMyller: \n, then.
17:28  AnthonyCat: ok, I seem to be getting closer. It still fires the event more than once
17:29  AnthonyCat: ah, I got it, thanks :)
17:29  dwarder: does unique array function exist? i.e. remove all non unique items?
17:30  kicken: dwarder, not as part of core javascript I don't think.  Possibly in a library if your using one.
17:30  gkatsev: not without an external lib or a custom prototype addition
17:30  dwarder: gkatsev: eMyller: thanks
17:30  dwarder: kicken: i use jquery
17:30  dwarder: kicken: well i'm learning
17:31  dwarder: let me query api of jquery
17:31  kicken: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
17:31  gkatsev: dwarder: learn pure js, jquery is just to make your life easier with the DOM and ajax and some other stuff.
17:31  gkatsev: don't become a jquery programmer. Best to be a javascript programmer who knows jquery very well.
17:31  Funcod: anyone could help me pinpoint what's not asynchrone in a piece of code?
17:31  Funcod: re
17:32  dwarder: gkatsev: what book do you suggest, i've almost read manning jquery in action book, and i think i have lack of knowledge in some areas of js
17:32  gkatsev: dwarder: how new are you to js?
17:32  bLiNdRaGe: anyone got an idea of what that question means?
17:32  eMyller: +1 to gkatsev.
17:32  gkatsev: `eloquent @ dwarder // might be a good place to start
17:32  jsBot: dwarder: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
17:33  kicken: I found the definitive guide by o'rielly to be good.
17:33  gkatsev: dwarder: after that Javascript: The Good Parts is good by Douglas Crockford and he has a series of talks on yahoo/youtube that are great
17:33  eMyller: Funcod: async is anything that doesn't wait for other code nor makes other code wait for it. "run in parallel".
17:33  Funcod: yeah i know
17:33  dwarder: gkatsev: i've written not hard stuff, i'm a php programmer, usualy i find something and modify it
17:33  Funcod: i just need another pair of eyes to be sure
17:34  eMyller: gkatsev, dwarder: and when you're full of js, let me present a better dom tool than jquery. :)
17:34  kicken: Funcod, pastebin some code
17:34  eMyller: "full" as "good"
17:34  gkatsev: dwarder: yeah, I recommend eloquent then, afterwards, JS:TGP and the definitive guide and other more advanced books
17:34  gkatsev: eMyller: such as?
17:35  dwarder: gkatsev: now that i see such cool things like jquery and nod.js i have more motivation
17:35  gkatsev: dwarder: node.js is pretty awesome.
17:35  gkatsev: I am rewriting my personal website in node
17:35  eMyller: gkatsev: i'm developing a dom helper library.
17:35  dwarder: thank you all
17:35  eMyller: in fact i already wrote it; am just preparing a new version, written from scratch.
17:35  gkatsev: eMyller: ah, heh. gl

17:37  eMyller: latest 2.x is pretty stable.
17:37  gkatsev: ah, yeah, I remember you linked it in here before at some point :)
17:37  FireFly|n900: gkatsev, btw, seems SpiderMonkey does in fact allow some.. well, pattern matching
17:38  gkatsev: FireFly|n900: does it? well, I mean [a,b] = [1,2,3] is pattern matching
17:38  eazyigz: node.js has so many frameworks now, I don't have a need to use Django anymore
17:38  FireFly|n900: js> function foo([a, {bar: b}]) a+b; foo([4, {bar: 5}])

17:38  FireFly|n900: I'd say it does
17:38  FireFly|n900: Works in Rhino as well, so it can't be too new
17:39  gkatsev: eazyigz: there are even django-like frameworks for node :)

18:27  Guest2010: I have to include lightbox2 on a page that already has jquery included, but now there occurs a conflict between jquery and prototype, how can I fix this problem?   the real problem is that I cannot overwrite jquery because I haven't got the permission
18:27  bnjmn: iganapolsky: is it a specific java web library?
18:27  iganapolsky: Struts
18:27  bnjmn: Struts...ok thanks. just curious
18:28  Guest2010: any ideas?
18:28  bnjmn: do Struts users typically prefer a certain DB like MySQL?
18:28  peeps[lappy]: Guest2010, jQuery.noConflict()
18:29  iganapolsky: I used struts with oracle and db2
18:29  MaxMeents_: need some ideas on why url="http://www.visoogle.com/"  is valid but not url="http://www.visoogle.com/_ajax/Movies/883/1999/Fight Club-1999-MPAA-R.html"  I'm adding twitter buttons dynamically next to all my movies
18:29  Guest2010: yes I've read that already but I can only include this jquery.noConflict()  but I cannot overwrite the function names in jquery.js
18:29  iganapolsky: bnjmn: It is essentially java's jdbc
18:30  bnjmn: yeah so anything that works with jdbc
18:30  iganapolsky: Yup
18:30  bnjmn: thanks dude
18:30  iganapolsky: No prob
18:30  peeps[lappy]: Guest2010, you mean you can't overwrite the code that calls the jquery?  or you can't overwrite the jquery library itself?
18:30  Guest2010: yes
18:31  MaxMeents_: if I type paste that second url in the top of my browser, it will go to that page and redirect back to visoogle becasue thats what that page is supposed to do but any ideas why it isn't a valid url if I can visit it through my browser?
18:31  peeps[lappy]: Guest15399, yes to which
18:31  Guest2010: the jqzery library itself
18:31  Guest2010: sorry: jquery
18:31  peeps[lappy]: you don't have to overwrite the library
18:31  peeps[lappy]: only change the code that calls the library
18:32  alaing: I'm trying to create a "log" function.  I'm console loging for browser that can use console.log which works perfectly but for IE I would like to use alert. I know alert would be a problem if I alert the object. WHats the best way to alert what the developer passes in to the log function, basically alert an object
18:32  NoiseEee: IE has a console.
18:32  NoiseEee: developers should be using it, not alert()
18:33  Guest2010: this is the problem, I cannot change the include of the library because it is an Desktop CMS which only allows me to change the content in between body-Tags
18:33  alaing: peeps[lappy]: you can overwrite it with a different version if you want to
18:33  peeps[lappy]: YOU DON"T HAVE TO CHANGE THE GODDAMN INCLUDE
18:33  NoiseEee: Guest2010: you've been suggested to use jQuery.noConflict()
18:33  alaing: how do you access ie console. you cant use console.log
18:33  NoiseEee: alaing: it has to be open
18:33  NoiseEee: alaing: ie8 only
18:34  alaing: grrr we still stuck in the ice age with ie6 and 7
18:34  Guest2010: yes but noConflict doesn't work
18:34  NoiseEee: alaing: we i'll grab IEDebugBar and JScompanion for those; i think then certainly "console" is valid
18:34  alaing: Guest2010: I've overwriten jqueyr versions before without any problem maybe you should ask in #jquery
18:34  NoiseEee: alaing: long story short, no real nice way of alert'ing objects obviously :)

18:35  NoiseEee: http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/CompanionJS/HomePage
18:35  Guest2010: this line is correct?   <script> jQuery.noConflict(); </script>
18:36  alaing: grrr with our IT secruity and department no chance of getting those installed
18:36  alaing: Guest2010: no
18:36  Guest2010: but?
18:36  alaing: Guest2010: var yourJQ= jQuery.noConflict();
18:36  alaing: then use yourJQ where ever yout like
18:37  NoiseEee: alaing: well then the long way... if(!console) {  //further code if thing.typeof=='object' making a nice string to alert }
18:37  Guest2010: do I have to write for "yourJQ" a special name or is it unimportant which one to take?
18:38  alaing: NoiseEee: I'm using jquery to detect IE. So typeof!='object' alert my string is what i should use
18:39  alaing: Guest2010: you can name it whatever you like it just placing jquery into that variable
18:39  NoiseEee: alaing: right, i was saying that you could then iterate over the object if you needed to, to make a nicely formatted string to alert to IE
18:40  alaing: NoiseEee: how can i make it a nicely formatted string.
18:40  alaing: I so love console.log
18:41  pigdude: alaing: I like how chrome shits itself if you try and treat it like a function object
18:41  pigdude: alaing: then I get to write lots of function() { console.log(arguments); }
18:41  NoiseEee: alaing: for(var x in obj) { if(obj.hasOwnProperty(x)) { str = str + x + ':'+obj[x]+'\n' } } kind of thing
18:41  Guest2010: okay, but now there is a script that I also cannot change below my lightbox-script  and this other script uses Juery and includes it at this position of the soureccode
18:41  Guest2010: and it still doesn't work
18:42  NoiseEee: Guest2010: why cant you just pick a jquery lightbox
18:42  pigdude: I thought jquery  is supposed to be a "safe" lib
18:42  pigdude: not augmenting natives and such
18:42  pigdude: how would its inclusion affect a standalone lightbox script?
18:43  Guest2010: can I modify lightbox2 to use jquery with it (replacing prototype)?
18:43  NoiseEee: the lightbox depends on prototype

19:18  fruitwerks: ok have a looky.. http://pics.boasbysatyra.com/access/fish.php clicking on the filename should copy the link and start meking a list below the pics - all is good, but the hover over the filenames is not consistent, sometimes I can't even click on some

19:18  Sorella: ehe, pattern matching awesomeness :3
19:19  gkatsev: if only it worked on v8 as well :(
19:20  gkatsev: fruitwerks: fishies. Also, clicking on a filename does nothing for me.
19:20  Sorella: you can at least use (function(a, b, c){ return a + b + c })(c=3,b=2,a=1); on v8 with getters/setters
19:21  Sorella: though it would be a getter/setter on the global object, so it could get pretty dangerous

19:30  gkatsev: v8: var åäö = 42; åäö

19:31  Sorella: Assuming Conkeror uses SpiderMonkey, it works on SM
19:31  gkatsev: fruitwerks: can only click on first 3
19:31  FireFly: dioek, as safe as keeping them external
19:31  FireFly: They share global scope in any case
19:31  gkatsev: Sorella: yeah, it pretty much has to use spidermonkey, I dont think they wanted to bother to hook it up with v8
19:32  Sorella: well, SpiderMonkey has lots of cool extensions, like let, yield and stuff
19:32  dioek: FireFly: Thanks!
19:32  FireFly: Wait, what engine was gbot2 using?
19:32  Sorella: gbot2: version
19:32  gkatsev: spidermonkey

19:33  FireFly: Hm, 'kay
19:34  FireFly: <Sorella> you can at least use (function(a, b, c){ return a + b + c })(c=3,b=2,a=1); on v8 with getters/setters
19:34  FireFly: <Sorella> though it would be a getter/setter on the global object, so it could get pretty dangerous
19:34  FireFly: Hrm
19:35  FireFly: Wouldn't one need to create a setter for every possible variable name?
19:35  Sorella: yep
19:35  FireFly: s/need/have/
19:35  FireFly: Blarg
19:35  Sorella: you'd have to define them before you use
19:35  FireFly: Would be a pretty neat hack to implement "named variables" though :P
19:35  Sorella: you can always use macros :3
19:35  Sorella: but yeah, it would be a pretty addition to js

19:52  antlong: hello, im using a firefox extension called firepath, and i noticed that the contents of a panel are not selectable with the cursor, you have to right click the element to copy it to your clipboard. i would like to change that. is there a function in this code that is preventing this functionality from happening? http://dpaste.de/fpG3/
19:53  antlong: line 887 is where copy is set in the context menu. i dont see anything that would indicate highlighting text with the mouse is disabled though
20:02  m0: klkdsadkasdasdsdsd14444

20:03  antlong: line 152 and 156 looks like the problem, but im not sure
20:10  Rockfang: hi all
20:10  Pilum: Lo
20:12  Rockfang: Might someone possibly know why the code at the following link is not displaying the submitted words but isnstead displaying "[object HTMLInputElement]" instead? http://pastebin.com/AGtaWS7m
20:13  Pilum: Because your referencing is awful.

20:13  jsBot: Rockfang: forms: Accessing form elements via JavaScript: Don't use document.formName.elementName. Use document.forms['formName'].elements['elementName'] or getElementById() or getElementsByName() instead.
20:13  Rockfang: hm
20:13  antlong: what do i need to change in this piece of code to allow leftClick to highlight the text you mousedown on and drag over? http://dpaste.de/ARhN/
20:13  Rockfang: i'm missing the .values
20:13  erichynds: is there a list of bot factoids somewhere?
20:14  pigdude: `factoids
20:14  pigdude: erichynds: I'm afraid not
20:15  Pilum: Rockfang: Yes. And your referencing is horrible.
20:15  erichynds: bummer
20:15  pigdude: erichynds: I'm sure there is, I was being facetious
20:15  Rockfang: ok.  i will attempt to do better.  im new at this.
20:15  Pilum: Rockfang: There's no guarantee it'll work even if you do add the .value to those.
20:16  Pilum: Rockfang: Using the elements collection, as suggested above, will be the most convenient approach.

20:20  antlong: its pure js, it shouldnt matter. youre not fighting the man by not helping.
20:20  pigdude: antlong: the construct we see here is not any direct way to listen on DOM events
20:20  pigdude: antlong: so we assume it is some additional layer
20:21  pigdude: antlong: and because you haven't pasted it, we assume it is third-party

20:28  enRaged: is there a way to set innerHTML to a webpage url?
20:28  NoiseEee: no
20:28  NoiseEee: but you can use an iframe
20:28 --- alaing_away is now known as alaing
20:28  enRaged: what about using ajax or something?
20:29  enRaged: right now i use ajax to see if a certain time in my databse > currenttime
20:29  enRaged: then i want to set the div display to block instead of hidden and display content of a dynamic page...
20:29  NoiseEee: enRaged: you can use your backend to fetch the contents, but you're markup would be insanely invalid and cause problems (two <body> tags for example)
20:30  enRaged: well can i dynamically set the iframe url somehow with javacript?
20:30  NoiseEee: of course
20:30  enRaged: can you point me to a tutorial or tell me how?
20:31  NoiseEee: google "change iframe location javascript"
20:31  enRaged: so basically ill pu the iframe in a div and set the div to block then set the iframe url, probably in the other order though
20:31  NoiseEee: document.getElementById('myIframeID').src = 'http://disney.ca/';
20:31  enRaged: thx noise

21:22  peeps[lappy]: uh, then how would you ever mouseout
21:22  NoiseEee: "info box location"?
21:22  NoiseEee: are you talking about a tooltip that follows your mouse?
21:22  outer_space: i never want the info box to do any events
21:22  outer_space: ya tooltip sounds better
21:23  peeps[lappy]: outer_space, record the mouse position when your box is created.  then on mousemove, update the box location with the difference between the inital x,y and the current mouse x/y
21:23  peeps[lappy]: use the mousex/y relative to page.  libraries like jquery make this easy
21:23  outer_space: ty, i'll have to look into the mousemove event

21:59  NoiseEee: rupert88: if the data's coming across, the user gets to access it.
21:59  frodenius: you want the user to not control if something is loaded?

21:59  rupert88: is that possible?

22:00  NoiseEee: i guess
22:00  NoiseEee: maybe you can give a 'key' to unencrypt it when the server says "ok"
