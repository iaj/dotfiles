08:32  examancr: any idea why this code doesn't successfully delete all rows?
08:32 --- Channel ##javascript was synced in 114 seconds
08:32  examancr: https://gist.github.com/715034
08:32  examancr: I'm iterating through all the rows in a table and trying to do deleteRows() on each one, but rows always seem to remain
08:32  examancr: is there a better way to do this?
08:33  Khisanth: examancr: go from bottom to top instead
08:34  Khisanth: or switch to while
08:34  inimino: or use a while ... yes
08:37  examancr: like while(tbody.rows.length > 0) { /* delete last row here */ } ??
08:38  wkmanire: Howdy folks.
08:41  examancr: while(tbody.rows.length>0){ tbody.deleteRow(0); } ... that seems to work grat
08:41  examancr: *great
08:41  examancr: thanks
09:04  wkmanire: Is it bad to name variables declared in a constructor function with prepended underscores?
09:05  wkmanire: jsLint doesn't seem to like that.
09:09 * wkmanire wonders why everyone wouldn't want to be writing an exciting javascript apt on a friday evening/saturday morning.
09:09  wkmanire: app*
09:10  joo: wkmanire, the only argument against it would be that such names tend to be used by implementers to add reserved identifiers
09:11  joo: However those tend to use two underscores on either end
09:11  joo: Like __proto__
09:11  wkmanire: joo: I was just about to say that.
09:11  wkmanire: joo: I think its just another of Mr. Crockford's preferences.
09:11  wkmanire: Like 4 space indentation.
09:11  joo: Yes.
09:12  joo: he likes to force his preferences onto other people.
09:12  wkmanire: He he he, I was chuckling when jsLint toled me my indentation was erroneous.
09:12  wkmanire: told*
09:12  wkmanire: I prefer "2 spaces" worth of "tab" if that makes sense.
09:13  joo: 3 spaces is enough IMO
09:13  wkmanire: Sure, when I work by myself I use spaces.
09:14  joo: But I tend to use 4 for compatibility with editors
09:14  wkmanire: On the job I use tabs so that people can adjust it to whatever they want.
09:15  wkmanire: I really dislike how religious tabs vs spaces is, although I must admit I haven't really ready very deeply into the issue.
09:15  wkmanire: Seems simple enough to me anyway.

09:33  JenniferB2: Hi, is there a way to get the function name in all browsers ? function abc () {}; abc.name == true; // works in FF but doesn't seem to be working in IE
09:34  wkmanire: JenniferB2: I don't think there is a straightforward way to do that.
09:35  wkmanire: I bet you can find some canned code somewhere that will do it though... get a function name via a function reference.
09:37  JenniferB2: i've tried to find some online.. but with no luck
09:37  wkmanire: hmm, the functions I'm seeing all do string manipulation.
09:37  wkmanire: But what if the function is native, or anonymous.
09:37  wkmanire: That might cause problems I think.
09:38  wkmanire: Why do you need to do that anyway?
09:40  binni: I have a date object that I don't know beforehand what is going to be, example: Wed Nov 24 2010 09:30:00 GMT+0000 (GMT), I want to get the same date object but always with time 00:00:00, how?
09:41  wkmanire: binni: Is the date coming in as a GMT string?
09:43  binni: wkmanire: what do you mean? It's not a string but  a Date object, and I think GMT is always in it
09:44  wkmanire: binni: Thats what I meant. I misunderstood you.
09:45  wkmanire: binni: How are you initializing the Date object?
09:45  Cork: binni: mydate.setHoures(0);mydate.setMinutes(0);mydate.setSeconds(0);
09:45  Cork: s/Houres/Hours/
09:46  binni: Cork: worked!
09:46  wkmanire: Cork: Thanks. He he he, I can be hard-headed sometimes.

10:09  purefusion: is there a JavaScript event for something like the visibility of an element?
10:09  purefusion: for example, whether it's in the window, or overflowing a container element
10:09  purefusion: whether or not*
10:10  joeytwiddle: no there's no event for that
10:10  joeytwiddle: you'd need to compare the bounding rectangles i guess
10:11  joeytwiddle: but it's hard to find the real top-left corner of a deep element without using jquery
10:11  purefusion: jquery is fine, actually
10:11  joeytwiddle: jquery has $.offset() i think
10:11  purefusion: now, I presume you'd have to use setTimeout to monitor something like that?
10:11  joeytwiddle: then you can check .clientWidth and .clientHeight
10:12  joeytwiddle: to monitor, yes a timeout is probably best
10:12  purefusion: how processor intensive would that be?
10:12  joeytwiddle: there are events like DOMNodeModified you could bind to
10:12  joeytwiddle: but i don't know if they fire on CSS changes
10:12  archeleus: js newbie here, does anyone know an easy way to parse comma seperated values?
10:12  archeleus: JSON maybe
10:12  joeytwiddle: purefusion: depends how long your timeout is
10:12  wkmanire: archeleus: Use the split function.
10:13  joeytwiddle: v8> "a,b,c".split(",")
10:13  v8bot: joeytwiddle: ["a", "b", "c"]
10:15  joeytwiddle: v8> "a,b,c".split(",")[1]
10:15  v8bot: joeytwiddle: "b"
10:15  archeleus: Thanks, how do I pass in the JSON file/
10:15  archeleus: *?
10:15  joeytwiddle: to parse JSON data, use JSON.parse(str) or whatever it is
10:15  archeleus: thanks again, will try it now
10:16  RiaGuy: Which naming style do you use for global namespaces ? ALLCAPS or CamelCase?
10:17  wkmanire: RiaGuy: I've seen YUI, and I've seen jQuery, and I've seen $.
10:17  wkmanire: I don't think there is a "way" to do that.
10:18  RiaGuy: Stoyan Stefanov for example recommends ALLCAPS
10:18  RiaGuy: I personally like CamelCase more..
10:18  wkmanire: Me too.
10:19  archeleus: Is a JSON file the best way to pass information to a script?
10:19  archeleus: I'm talking about stuff like passing
10:19  archeleus: coordinates of google maps
10:19  archeleus: for markers
10:19  archeleus: etc
10:20  wkmanire: acheleus: Is the data static?
10:20  wkmanire: As in, are you going to have a file published to the server that just contains JSON? Or are you going to return data from a webservice of some sort?
10:20  archeleus: well as of now yes, but I want my users to be able to supply in data after I'm done with the first part
10:20  archeleus: File published
10:21  wkmanire: JSON isn't a file format so much as an expression of data using Javascript syntax.
10:21  ablomen: RiaGuy, for me, CamelCase is constructors, ALLCAPS is "packages/modules" and the rest is all small letter first and after that camelcase
10:21  wkmanire: archeleus: Its a combination of object and array literals.
10:22  wkmanire: archeleus: If the data is that static, you can just put the JSON literal in your script, or in another script file which is included in the pages that require it.
10:22  archeleus: wkmanire: Yes, i'm passing data in the form <latitude, longitude>
10:22  archeleus: wkmanire: So whenever I want a new coordinate added I can just use PHP to append to the script?
10:24 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
10:24  wkmanire: It depends on what you're trying to do.
10:24  wkmanire: Data structures are very natural... easy to represent in Javascript. You can do practically anything you want.
10:24  archeleus: I'm trying to lay out markers on a map using google maps api 3.0
10:24  archeleus: So I guess JSON is indeed the right format for this
10:24  strauss91: Hi guys
10:24  wkmanire: What is the process? User enters data into a form and posts, you then interperate that, produce JSON and write it back to the page where it is picked up and handed off to the google api?
10:25  strauss91: Does anything look wrong with the following line of JS? delbutton.onclick = new Function(deleteRows(tableID, rowCounter));
10:25  wkmanire: strauss91: What is Function?
10:26  strauss91: just a name to cast the method deleteRows as you cannot directly reference a method using element.onClick
10:26  archeleus: wkmanire: I have a text file with the points
10:26  archeleus: wkmanire: So user doesn't do anything
10:26  archeleus: wkmanire: For now
10:26  archeleus: wkmanire: Later, I'll have a form that allows them to add points
10:27  wkmanire: I see.
10:28  wkmanire: strauss91: there is no casting taking place there. the result of executing deleteRows(tableId, rowCounter) is being passed to a constructor function named Function.
10:28  strauss91: Thats what I meant :/
10:28  strauss91: Sorry lol XD
10:29  wkmanire: onClick is probably a typo, onclick is what you need.
10:29  strauss91: Ok let me try that
10:29  strauss91: thanks
10:29  strauss91: No change
10:29  wkmanire: archeleus: You probably have the right idea, learn more about what JSON is though.
10:30  strauss91: Basically what is happening is that instead of deleting the row in question, it deletes the row with the table header in
10:30  wkmanire: strauss91: when delbutton is clicked you want to execute deleteRows and pass in tableID and rowCounter, correct?
10:30  strauss91: Correct
10:30  archeleus: Doing. Need to get this together in like 6 hours
10:30  RiaGuy: Starting new app.. is it how it gonna be look like? http://pastebin.com/8i5m9eQx any issues so far, coding style ok?
10:30  buubot: RiaGuy:  The 24 line paste 8i5m9eQx has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/1155  .
10:31  wkmanire: strauss91: you are assigning the result of executing delRows with tableID and rowCounter being whatever they are in the current context at that time.
10:32  wkmanire: strauss91: with that statement you are not telling delbutton to execute deleteRows when it is clicked.
10:32  strauss91: Oh I see....
10:32  strauss91: So in order to execute delRows when the button is pressed what should I do?
10:33  wkmanire: May I see your code?
10:33  strauss91: Sure
10:33  strauss91: Any part in particular?
10:34  wkmanire: strauss91: I'd like to see the html for the page and the entire javascript if possible.
10:34  strauss91: Ok!

10:35  strauss91: HTML for the table body
10:35  wkmanire: looking
10:37  wkmanire: strauss91: You have some different options available.
10:37  strauss91: Ok
10:37  strauss91: What would you recommend?
10:38  wkmanire: Well, since all of your functions are in the global scope, this might work...
10:38  wkmanire: delbutton.setAttribute('onclick', 'deleteRows(' + tableID + ',' + rowCounter.toString() + ')');
10:38  wkmanire: I think thats going to be inline what how you want this to work.
10:38  strauss91: Cheers! Will give that a go now!
10:39  wkmanire: strauss91: Be careful about using javascript as if it were C or C++, or even PHP. It will bite you if you do.
10:39 * wkmanire smiles.
10:39  wkmanire: Just some friendly advice.
10:40  wkmanire: strauss91: I made a typo, you need to wrap tableID in double quotes.
10:40  wkmanire: ..."' + tableID + '",' ....
10:41  phenner: TypeError: Cannot call method deleteRow with value null
10:42  wkmanire: phenner === strauss91?
10:42  phenner: Ah oops! Yep
10:42  phenner: sorry
10:43  wkmanire: he he he
10:44  wkmanire: phenner: That means at some point tableID or rowCounter is null most likely.
10:45  phenner: It would seem so
10:45  wkmanire: wait, no.
10:45  wkmanire: deleteRow is a different function.
10:45  wkmanire: phenner: table is an HTMLElement if document.getElementById succeeds.
10:45  phenner: Correct
10:45  wkmanire: phenner: Unless you attached the method deleteRow to it, it won't have it.
10:46  phenner: That is essentially what I am trying to achieve
10:46  wkmanire: phenner: You have table.deleteRow(rowId). deleteRow is a function in the global scope and not a meember of table.
10:47  molgrew: wkmanire: but it is
10:47  phenner: Yes. However I had assumed that the code "table.deleteRow(rowID) would do the deleting rows on the table in question
10:47  wkmanire: molgrew: it is?
10:47  molgrew: it is
10:48  wkmanire: I must be missing something :)  Care to explain?
10:48  molgrew: table elements have a deleteRow method
10:49  wkmanire: ahh.... I wasn't aware.
10:49  phenner: but the question still remains
10:49  phenner: why is either tableID or rowID null?
10:50  wkmanire: phenner: Just a moment, I want to get all of my ducks in a row before I offer up an explanation.
10:51  phenner: Haha, sorry just thinking out loud!
10:51 * wkmanire intended the pun.
10:51  wkmanire: phenner: look here http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_table_deleterow.asp
10:52  phenner: Ah ok slightly different to mine
10:52  phenner: Shall I replace my function with that and see how it goes?
10:53  wkmanire: Was that the original intent? Where you trying to avoid using the deleteRow method you wrote?
10:53  FernandoBasso: Why doesn't this 'return false' seem to work? It doesn't stop the current browser tab from following the link. --> http://pastebin.com/A4SiegCv

10:54  RiaGuy: Do you know any good samples of great JavaScript architecture?
10:54  wkmanire: RiaGuy: node.js might qualify.
10:54  phenner: I am not sure really... i just got a bit confused with it all. Let me try that code and see what happens
10:55  wkmanire: phenner: What is this project for? I'm just curious.
10:56 --- riven` is now known as riven
10:56  RiaGuy: wkmanire node.js isn't fully implemented with JavaScript..
10:56  RiaGuy: i guess it's written in C
10:57  phenner_: Still complaining about this null business
10:57  wkmanire: RiaGuy: Some C some javascript, only when the author needed to grant access to the hardware.
10:57  molgrew: FernandoBasso: you need to call preventDefault on the event object in the DOM2 (addEventListener) event model to do that
10:58  RiaGuy: I am looking for an example of JavaScript library similar to YUI
10:58  phenner_: However the HTML for the new row when created is: <input type="button" style="text-align: center; width: 25px; " value="-" onclick="deleteRows(dataTable,row2)">
10:58  RiaGuy: Implemented with good architecture
10:58  FernandoBasso: molgrew: Oh. Okay. I haven't learned that yet. Thanks for pointing me to the right direction.
10:58 --- Guest41558 is now known as davidw
10:59  wkmanire: phenner_: I think you missed it when I corrected a typo I had made, tableId and rowId need to be quoted since they are strings.
10:59  phenner_: Ah ok let me try that. Thanks!
10:59  phenner_: Where do I quote them?
10:59  wkmanire: phenner_: What is this project for?
11:00  phenner_: A product order system
11:02  phenner_: Now it says cannot read property parentNode of undefined
11:03  wkmanire: phenner_: There is a lot of potential for problems in that script. If you want we can take this script on to piratepad and work through it together.
11:04  phenner_: That would be great!..... but! What is piratepad ?! ;)
11:04  wkmanire: phenner_: Its a web application that allows concurrent editing of a text buffer.
11:04  phenner_: Ah ok.
11:04  phenner_: Cool how do we get onto it?
11:04  wkmanire: I'll set up a link, just a moment.
11:05  phenner_: Great thanks!
11:05  FernandoBasso: molgrew: Okay. I pass the 'event' argument, and do event.preventDefault(); Thanks a lot.

11:08  Styles: Hey I  know this is such a noob questin, but why does javascript have to come at the end of a file?
11:08  Styles: Why can't you place the <script> in the header
11:09  wkmanire: Styles: To be terse, its because the browser does things asyncronously.
11:09  Styles: I assumed so, but thank you for the clarity.
11:09  wkmanire: Styles: If you want to work with the DOM you have to wait for it to be loaded.
11:09  FernandoBasso: Styles: Because you javascript will try to deal with nodes that are not yet ready in the DOM>
11:09  Styles: So I'm assuming once again that if you include a file, it's loaded after the initial page, thus happening later? after the nodes arel oaded.
11:10  FernandoBasso:  No.
11:11  FernandoBasso: As soon as the browser sees an <script src='...'> it will first download and execute that.
11:12  FernandoBasso: And when the browser executes that javascript, many DOM elements do not exist yet.
11:12  FernandoBasso: (I'm learning this myself)
11:13  FernandoBasso: Styles: Basically, you can wrap your code into a function, and call it with window.onload = myFunction();
11:13  FernandoBasso: I think this is the most basic way to do that.
11:14  FernandoBasso: And the experienced people here, fell free to correct me if I am wrong.
11:15  Styles: Yeah I decided to build some fun with js today
11:15  Styles: I'm not really a front end dev, but I want to learn so this is my attempt haha
11:16  Styles: The syntax is for sure odd, but meh non the less not that hard just time consuming until you remember a lot of the functions.
11:16  FernandoBasso: Styles: I found this part of the JavaScript the most complex one. Understanding how to Wait for the DOM to be ready.
11:16  wkmanire: Styles: Javascript gets more fascinating the deeper you go. Especially if you are an object oriented type of programmer.
11:17  molgrew: it probably should be window.onload = myFunction; unless myFunction is a factory, and you also have the onload attribute of the body element, which is very basic too
11:17  Styles: wkmanire: yeah I'm an OOP myself.
11:17  wkmanire: wkmanire: I'm absolutely hooked. It makes .Net feel clumsy and awkward.
11:17  Styles: I find t his annoying to use tbh
11:18  Styles: How can you compare .NET to JavaScript?
11:18  FernandoBasso: I found the first steps in JavaScript are not that difficult. The problems always happen because of the state of the DOM when the script tries to exectue.
11:18  wkmanire: styles*
11:18  wkmanire: he he he
11:18 * wkmanire shouldn't talk to himself.
11:18  Styles: It's like comparing a car to a shoe
11:18  Styles: They are just different.
11:19  Styles: What are some fun drills or examples I can make ?
11:19  wkmanire: Styles: I'm comparing them in their expressiveness.
11:19  wkmanire: going to be afk a few.
11:19  wkmanire: brb
11:19  Styles: ah
11:19  Styles: www.20thingsilearned.com is what actually got me hooked
11:19  Styles: The way they designed that site, is amazing.
11:19  Styles: Go Google Chrome team!
11:20  amcsi: is there a good way to debug ajax-linked javascript code? firebug shows the errors as if they were in the file that eval-ed the code, and says the error line is at the line number of the eval added to the line number of where the error really is in the external file. This is bad, because it's hard to find the line where the error happened, and also, I don't know which external js file it happened in. Is there a good way to debug?
11:21  TheSheep: amcsi: I guess that's one advantage of a <script> tag injection
11:22  amcsi: I see
11:22  FernandoBasso: Styles: Amazing!
11:22  TheSheep: amcsi: perhaps you could write the code to console before you eval() it

12:56  Fratyr: Hello! Anyone has a good/proper regex to strip comments from javascript files?
12:58  zomg: Have you considered using one of the javascript minifiers available?
13:00  TheSheep: Fratyr: I know this may be a shock for you, but javascript has a context-free syntax which cannot possibly be parsed with regular expressions alone
13:01  TheSheep: Fratyr: in short, such regex cannot exist
13:01  Fratyr: I'll parse It in php.
13:01  Fratyr: javascript file is a string for me. all I need is to strip //lines and /* code blocks */
13:02  TheSheep: Fratyr: how about "// code blocks in strings" ?
13:02 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:02  TheSheep: Fratyr: and a thousand of other corner cases
13:02  TheSheep: "/* comment blocks in strings"
13:02  TheSheep: whatever
13:02  Fratyr: yeah that can be a problem :)
13:03  TheSheep: you need a full parser
13:03  TheSheep: minifiers do that and more
13:03  TheSheep: some have some settings that control what to strip
13:05  d_mitar: Fratyr: why not use something like jsmin / yui and get it to strip comments for you then use jsbeautify
13:05  Fratyr: It can be done on the fly?
13:06  d_mitar: with things like mod_pagespeed yes
13:11  Jemt: Hello guys. I need to override an OnClick event handler on an object. Can I do this ?  obj.onclick = function() { obj.onclick; alert('This is the new code'); }
13:12  Jemt: Unfortunately I wouldn't expect this to work. So how do I include the old code in the new handler ?
13:12  cheney: Jemt: why would you do that?
13:12  d_mitar: to stack up events
13:12  d_mitar: :/
13:12  Jemt: cheney: I'm extending the functionality of an existing object
13:12  Jemt: d_mitar: Exactly
13:12  Jemt: BRB
13:13  cheney: Jemt: dont do that
13:13  TheSheep: Jemt: you can save the old handler
13:13  d_mitar: you realy ought to use addEventListener ish
13:13  d_mitar: methods instead
13:14  cheney: jemt call a named function that resides in an external file, otherwise you are wasting your users time and making it look like you have no idea what you are doing
13:15  Jemt: Thanks for the suggestions. The object is not my own (it's an input field from a GUI framework), which has the onclick attribute set. So attaching an event is the way to do it ?
13:18  zomg: Jemt: you probably should read the documentation of your GUI framework
13:18  Jemt: zomg: I appriciate your suggestions, but really, this is the way to do it. The framework is buggy, so this is a work around
13:19  Jemt: (suggested by the developers of the framework)
13:21  zomg: Sounds like you might want to use something else ;)
13:21  Jemt: Telerik RadControls is buggy as hell, but probably one of the better frameworks
13:22  Jemt: After all, this framework is almost as complex as a space shuttle :)
13:23  Jemt: Attaching the handler using attachEvent worked. Thanks guys
13:23  Jemt: (I know it's not cross platform :))

13:38  garymc: or what the correct terminology is?
13:39  TheSheep: no, not really, but if you want something hidden, you should remove it from the page being sent before it is sent, not with js
13:39  TheSheep: becsue users can easily disable js and still see it

15:40  voodootikigod: returns false
15:40  voodootikigod: (if cancel)

15:42  voodootikigod: <a href='/url' onclick='return confirm("remove?");'>Delete</a>
15:44  markpollard: so i can get result in php ?
15:44  hrnt: why do you want to receive the result in php?
15:44  hrnt: if the user clicks cancel, why do you want to know?
15:44  voodootikigod: it wont fire if they hit cancel
15:44  markpollard: so i can remove the item using php mysql
15:44  voodootikigod: it only fires on cofirmation
15:45  Maxdamantus: Are you aware of when all of the PHP code is typically executed in relation to the JS?

16:16  Maxdamantus: Do you want to shift every element down?
16:16  Maxdamantus: or do you not care about order?
16:17  Maxdamantus: (every one after the "c" you remove)
16:17  Wes-: AnthonyCat: Array.prototype.splice
16:17  Maxdamantus: Mmm.. That could work, nvm.
16:18  Wes-: sure, locate "c" however (he didn't say how it's special, maybe indexOf), then use splice to remove it from the array
16:18  Wes-: oh, warning, no indexOf in IE without adding it yourself
16:18 * Wes- spits toward Redmond
16:18  AnthonyCat: lol, IE sucks
16:19  AnthonyCat: so I would just do Array.prototype=function (){...(indexOf)...}
16:19  AnthonyCat: Array.prototype.indexOf oops
16:20  Wes-: AnthonyCat: There is an indexOf implementation on MDC
16:20  AnthonyCat: thanks
16:20  Wes-: Or you can use Narwhal's ES5 patch-ups to get a bunch more
16:21  AnthonyCat: what if i've already loaded jquery, does that have indexOf?
16:21  Pilum: `js ref array indexOf
16:21  Pilum: `array indexOf
16:21  jsBot: array indexOf: indexOf is only supported in JS1.6+ .. so you can optionally add it as a prototype to earlier versions:  if(![].indexOf) Array.prototype.indexOf = function(needle){ for(var i=0; i<this.length; i++) if(this[i] == needle) return i; return -1 }

17:01  mordof: i'm gonna guess that it doesn't like document.cookie = <random string in form of cookie data>
17:02  mordof: hmm..
17:02  mordof: mads-, cookie data can't contain whitespaces
17:02  mads-: Doh

17:03  mads-: mordof: thanks!
17:04 * mordof ndos
17:04  mordof: nods**
17:06  mordof: mads-, i personally store all dates as timestamps, easier to work with imo
17:07  mordof: whenever they need to be displayed, that's when i format them for human viewing
17:07  mads-: How will the browser then know how long to keep them?
17:07  mads-: I want the cookie to stay on the client as long as possible
17:07  molgrew: the expires attribute is fine, don't worry about it
17:09  mordof: "to ensure that the string does not contain any commas, semicolons, or whitespace (which are disallowed in cookie values)." that doesn't apply to the expires value then molgrew?
17:09  molgrew: where's the rest of the quote?
17:09  mordof: "The cookie value string can use encodeURIComponent() to ensure that the string does not contain any commas, semicolons, or whitespace (which are disallowed in cookie values)."
17:09  molgrew: "The cookie value string"
17:10  mordof: key=value pairs, i thought that just meant it applied to every pair value
17:10  mordof: don't get me wrong, i've never worked with cookies - i'm just confused here, lol
17:11  mads-: Thanks for your input, guys
17:11  mads-: I have to go now, though. But I think I know where the problem is now
