09:39  karika200: I have this JS function: http://pastebin.com/UcUfnjzY
09:39  buubot: karika200:  The 20 line paste UcUfnjzY has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/888  .
09:39  iaj: I've got a request - is there some way to be able when I click on a radiobutton, check with javascript if its already selected and if it is.. uncheck it???
09:40  karika200: but when I put an alert instead of the return, it writes out the correct answer, but if I try to write out the return value I get undefined... why?
09:44  henrikkok: iaj: you should use checkboxes for that. but i think that you can set checked="false"
09:45  joeytwiddle: hemanth: might not be possible.  someone was asking about that earlier this week.  they found that XHR redirected automatically for them.  have you been able to inspect the response headers at all?
09:45  joeytwiddle: you can view them in Chrome or with Firebug i think
09:46  enoj: Could anyone care to take a quick look at this page and try to see why the pixenate.js file doesn't load with IE7? http://developer.idekor.no/produkter/plakat/ditt-bilde-pa-plakat.html - the pixenate.js file is here: http://developer.idekor.no/js/allkopi/pixenate.js - this file contains an alert() at the top which is never executed in IE7. Alert shows in other browsers
09:46  hemanth: joeytwiddle, i'm sure about the location have the redirected url, but not able to fetch it
09:47  joeytwiddle: damn
09:49  joeytwiddle: but is that header in the first response, or the final response?
09:49  joeytwiddle: enoj: perhaps you need DOS-style newlines
09:50 --- threeb is now known as babbos
09:50  hemanth: joeytwiddle, luckily its just a single redirection, so first is the final for me in this case
09:51  enoj: joeytwiddle: what header? I don't understand
09:53  joeytwiddle: *sigh*
09:54  joeytwiddle: <joeytwiddle> enoj: perhaps you need DOS-style newlines
09:55  joeytwiddle: header discussion was not for you
09:55  enoj: doh, sorry.
09:55  joeytwiddle: np lol
09:56  sbaader: js ref
09:57  hemanth: joeytwiddle, what would your suggestion be to get the first redirection?
09:57  enoj: joeytwiddle: is that a common IE7 issue, Javascript file needs DOE-style newlines in order to parse properly ?
09:58  joeytwiddle: enoj, hemanth: sorry i don't know more
09:58  joeytwiddle: just trying to help with some guessing ;)
09:58  hemanth: joeytwiddle, np, will keep trying :)
09:59  sbaader: hi.. is there a good way to determine the offset of a DOM Range w respect to a toplevel DOM element? I need the offset of the caret w regard to a content-editable div..
10:00  joeytwiddle: <sipher>        after googling a bit it seems AJAX doesn't play nice with 302 redirects at all. ;(
10:00  joeytwiddle: that's as far as the other guy got
10:02  joeytwiddle: sbaader: do you mean offset in pixels?
10:04  sbaader: nope, the cursor position. I have an editable div with other divs and text nodes in it, an I need the absolute position w regard to the containing div. but rnages only go back to the latest div in the text
10:05  sbaader: *mages = ranges
10:08  joeytwiddle: the number of chars away from the start?
10:08  sbaader: joeytwiddle: yup!
10:09  joeytwiddle: could you just add what the range says, to the charsize of all preceding divs?
10:09  joeytwiddle: might require a fiddly walk through the DOM
10:10  sbaader: sounds useful..
10:10  joeytwiddle: might be worth drawing a tree on paper and practicing ;)
10:11  joeytwiddle: i think when you go to a previousNode or parentNode.previousNode, you'll need to follow as many lastChild's as possible
10:11  sbaader: so I would traverse from the 'mother' node until I find the node that the range starts with, and sum all lengths, right?
10:11  joeytwiddle: that's what i was thinking yes
10:11  sbaader: I'll give that a try - thanks!
10:11  joeytwiddle: oh, well, keep going until you hit your "containing div"
10:11  joeytwiddle: good luck ^^
10:12  sbaader: :)

12:02  Juandev: ohi
12:03  philk_: is it possible to extend the Number class so that one could call 1024.megabytes ?
12:05  Sorella: philk_: you can add it to the Number.prototype. But that can lead to problems if another library wants to implement a different version of `Number.megabytes`.
12:06  Sorella: It's not much of a problem if you know what code'll be running on your site tho.
12:06  philk_: Sorella: ah ok, cool. Cause coming from ruby on rails I really miss such functions :)
12:06  Sorella: v8> Number.prototype.megabytes = function(){ return this / 1024 / 1024 }; 1024.megabytes()
12:06  v8bot: Sorella: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
12:06  luneff: hm. nice idea, actually
12:07  philk_: hmmm not working?
12:07  Sorella: v8> Number.prototype.megabytes = function(){ return this / 1024 / 1024 }; (1024).megabytes()
12:07  v8bot: Sorella: 0.0009765625
12:08  philk_: in ruby we also have 10.times(function(index) {})
12:08  luneff: in firefox we have "missing ; before statement" :)
12:08  philk_: Sorella: hmm that does not look good (1024)... I think thats a constructor call?
12:09  luneff: oh. parens rule
12:09  Sorella: that's because number.something is usually a float :3
12:09  luneff: ok, ok :P
12:09  Sorella: so, if you do 10.times the interpreter will choke on `t` not being a digit
12:10  Sorella: so you wrap it in parenthesis to get a number object that you can access properties of
12:11  luneff: got it 2 minutes ago, thanks :))
12:11  luneff: its a cool way for us to spell distances -- (10000).distance() --> 10 km :)
12:13  philk_: yeah ok
12:13  philk_: cool
12:13  philk_: (10).days.from.now we can write in Rails :)
12:14  philk_: luneff: better even (10000).km -> 10
12:14  gls\Fr4NgUs:  Hello all, I have a problem http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/ Because for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
12:14  philk_: or for the only country that is still not using the metric system (10000).miles
12:15  luneff: its just that (10005).distance() should yield 10 km 5 m
12:16  Sorella: philk_: the only thing you should think twice before extending is the Object prototype tho, because all objects share it so the risk of collisions with another thing is far greater.
12:17  philk_: Sorella: well, I know what I am including in my app, so this is ok
12:17  Sorella: :3
12:18  RiaGuy: How to get YouTube ID from the URL to a YouTube video with JS RegExp ? Somthing like var id = /someregex/(url); ?
12:18  philk_: luneff: well (10005).km() => 10.005
12:18  Sorella: that's the best part of prototypal inheritance.
12:18  luneff: we could have both distance and km :)
12:19  philk_: luneff: sure, but then you would have to describe in the docs, what distance actually returns
12:19  Sorella: RiaGuy: you could try #regex for #regex specific questions. But it would be var id = url.match(/regex/)
12:19  Sorella: it returns an array of matches.
12:19  philk_: luneff: the whole idea is to be desriptive on its own
12:19  luneff: hm. also it is possible to do (10000).m() and (10000).km() and return different objects ;)
12:19  luneff: i.e. provide measurement units :)
12:20  philk_: of course... and you could also have (10000).in('km') end other developers could extend Number.prototype.in further with new units
12:20  luneff: pity there is no operators overload in js :-D
12:20  Sorella: luneff: there is.
12:21  philk_: Sorella: there is?
12:21  Sorella: you just have to use javascript as a meta-language.
12:21  gls\Fr4NgUs: pls someone can help me
12:21  Sorella: philk_: basically, you could implement it by rewriting a function in run-time.
12:21  luneff: idea is to have (10000).in('m') + (10000).in('km') -> 10010.in('km')
12:21  Sorella: https://github.com/spencertipping/caterwaul ~ does something along these lines
12:23  luneff: hm
12:27  Sorella: basically, you'd rewrite x + y to sum(x, y). And this `sum` function would see if the first operator has a `__sum__` method and call that if true, otherwise do the generic x + y operation.
12:28  luneff: that's lispy. it is cool but redefining "+" would allow brains to turn off when writing the code :)
12:29  luneff: anyways i might use these ideas in the project :)
12:29  luneff: so thanks ;)
12:30  RiaGuy: Sorella, ok, thanks
12:30  Juandev: I am wondering that IE doesnt understand such script:  if ( [ 'Page1', 'Page2', 'Page3', 'Page4' ].indexOf(wgPageName) != -1 ) importStylesheet("MediaWiki:PageGroups/GroupName.css");
12:31  luneff: what is importStylesheet? :)
12:31  luneff: perhaps you need document.createNode with node being stylesheet )
12:32  Juandev: luneff: well, FF understand that and perform the script correctly

12:34  Juandev: is performed by IE correctly
12:34  luneff: what is the error message then?
12:35  Juandev: luneff: no error message, just the IE browser is not importing the style
12:35  luneff: is DOM modified after the script?

13:22  philk_: A server expects a time in the xsd:dateTime notation... which is UTC time. How do I convert/format a JS Date object into such time expression?
13:27 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:28  Sorella: philk_: you'll probably have to concatenate the Date's properties yourself. I'm not familiar with that notation.
13:29  philk_: Sorella: looks like this "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ms+0000"
13:31  Sorella: philk_: JavaScript has no builtin routine for date formatting. But you can do with the properties and some padding. Or a date library. Do the displayed date need to be in UTC?
13:31  philk_: Sorella: I am just not sure about the timezone offset
13:31  philk_: Sorella: yes the server expects UTC dates
13:33  Sorella: You can use this function to convert: function getUTCDate(date){ return new Date(~~(date - date.getTimezoneOffset() * 60)); }
13:34  Sorella: TimezoneOffset returns the offset in minutes, if I'm not mistaken

14:11  ablomen: hemanth, try looking in the rhino docs
14:12  hemanth: ablomen, readUrl is confined to rhino only ? me trying to do a simple JavaScript
14:13  ablomen: hemanth, it's going to depend on what env you are running it in, there is no way to load stuff in "simple javacript", or not one that is implemented "everywhere" anyway
14:14  hemanth: ablomen, in my terminal in rhino> readUrl() works fine as you mentioned, but i need to get the response headers from a url, what must i do ? XMLHttpRequest??
14:14  ablomen: hemanth, like i said, check the documentation, i only use rhino for the "js" command in my terminal, never used it to do anything useful
14:15  hemanth: ablomen, kool ok :)

14:51  ablomen: big_ham, they can still cause unexpected problems though
14:51  big_ham: (I use firebug extensively, but only for CSS)
14:51  ablomen: enable the console tab
14:52  ablomen: it will show you errors, line numbers, you can use console.log(variable) to see debug info etc

15:04  big_ham: when I inspect the link in firefox, it shows the rel= tag, but it's not launching in a shadowbox ?
15:09  ablomen: big_ham, i think shadowbox binds the events on load
15:10  ablomen: so if you add something after it is loaded, it does not have the right event handlers, you will have to bind it manually or re-initialize shadowbox after you added the dynamic stuff

15:17  _sudo: meh.  I don't pirate software.  It would be a bit ironic since I am a software developer.
15:29  big_ham: _sudo, I hear ya ... I buy lots of software for my iPad, Android phone, desktop computer, etc
15:29  big_ham: Photoshop is so friggin expensive ...
15:30  big_ham: (not that I'm justified)
15:30  big_ham: so, ablomen? I kinda found what I need, but it's saying:
15:30  big_ham: set up all anchor elements with a "movie" class to work with Shadowbox
15:31  big_ham: does that mean <a class="movie" rel="shadowbox" href="link"></a>
15:31  big_ham: ?
15:39  KucukMubasir: what is the cache size in browsers for each component? 4kb, right?
15:40  jinx__: how can I go about detecting whether or not I'm in the frame called preload?
15:44 --- amigojapan_ is now known as amigojapan
15:48  EvanR-work: jinx__: why would you need that?
15:51  jinx__: EvanR-work, I'm preloading the next page on a website
15:51  jinx__: basically I want to check the name of the iframe
15:51  EvanR-work: oh, iframe
15:52  jinx__: if it equals preload then the javascript doesn't execute
15:52  jinx__: so it doesn't loop
15:52  EvanR-work: this sounds pretty bad
15:52  EvanR-work: why would it loop
15:53  jinx__: well the next page has the same code
15:53  jinx__: for the page after that
15:53  jinx__: but I don't want it to start loading recursively
15:54  EvanR-work: maybe you should use ajax instead
15:54  EvanR-work: then you only load javascript once and the css once etc
15:55  EvanR-work: and you can preload each page rather than every other page
15:55  jinx__: yah, I thought about that
15:55  jinx__: but I couldn't find any good examples
15:55  diamonds: how can I target an element in an iframe if the same ID exists outside of the iframe?
15:55  EvanR-work: parent.framename.foo
15:55  diamonds: #foo on page I want #foo in iframe
15:55  diamonds: EvanR-work: ok thank you
15:56  diamonds: will try
15:56  EvanR-work: parent.framename.document.findById...
15:56  diamonds: document.framename?
15:56  EvanR-work: no?
15:56  diamonds: ok?
15:56  diamonds: :)
15:56  diamonds: thank you?
15:56  EvanR-work: i dont understand why you said that
15:57  diamonds: EvanR-work: because I'm not to knowledgable about the reserved terms in js and when to use them
15:57  diamonds: I bought js the good parts, I'll read it soon.  sry for the basic question!
15:57  EvanR-work: they arent reserved terms
15:57  diamonds: oh I guess what I mean is to you literally mean the string "parent" or are you using that as a placeholder?
15:58  EvanR-work: literally parent
15:58  diamonds: EvanR-work: ok ty
15:58  EvanR-work: framename is the placeholder
15:59  JeffJassky: Hey, guys. I'm really awful with regular expressions. I'm trying to make an expression that will match a forward slash if it is the first or last character of a string. for example /path/to/dir/ would match the first and last /.
15:59  diamonds: EvanR-work: framename... that's not the ID I take it
15:59  EvanR-work: no its name of the frame
15:59  EvanR-work: document.getElementById(theId)
15:59  diamonds: the iframe i'm trying to target doesn't have a name attrib set
15:59  diamonds: ok thanks
16:00  EvanR-work: well, if its the only iframe
16:00  EvanR-work: get element by tag name
16:00  EvanR-work: hrm
16:01  EvanR-work: hopefully you have a sane js developer tools console to try stuff in
16:01  EvanR-work: firebug
16:01  diamonds: EvanR-work: yeah that's what I'm doing
16:02  jinx__:   if (top.location != preload) {
16:02  jinx__: EvanR-work, would something like that work?
16:02  EvanR-work: whats preload?
16:02  jinx__: the iframe name
16:03  EvanR-work: its a string?
16:03  EvanR-work: do top.location.toString() in your console to see what it says
16:03  EvanR-work: its not a framename for me
16:05  EvanR-work: jinx__: funny, top window and parent all seem to be the same thing
16:06  EvanR-work: if you use a variable that is not declared as a var, it defaults to window.foo
16:06  EvanR-work: so i would say use window, not top, and not parent
16:07  EvanR-work: and not nothing, since you can declare variables later which messes up your code
16:20  diamonds: EvanR-work: found this: var myIFrame = document.getElementById('iframe_lyrics');
16:20  diamonds: var content = myIFrame.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML;
16:20  diamonds: like what you were saying more or less
16:20  diamonds: ty

16:32  Gregor: inimino: Should probably add semicolons to your elision-count test to avoid conflating elision with correctly-implemented semicolon insertion.
