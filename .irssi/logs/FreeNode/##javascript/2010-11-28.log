01:05  linusoleander_: Is for a closure ?
01:05  linusoleander_: Like a function
01:05  Maxdamantus: no.
01:05  gkatsev: no blockscope
01:06  linusoleander_: OKey, thanks!
01:09  linusoleander_: How is it with functions, if I just use mySuperFunk function(){}, is it then global?
01:09  Maxdamantus: If it's on the global scope.
01:09  gkatsev: only functions create new scope in js
01:10  Pilum: More like an error if you write it like that.
01:10  linusoleander_: Okey, what is prefetred, to use
01:10  linusoleander_: var myFunk = function(){}
01:10  linusoleander_: or the other one I posted?
01:10  Maxdamantus: It's a global if that code appears in the lexically global scope.
01:12  Pilum: function mySuperFunc() {}
01:14  l4rk: linusoleander_: preferred? they aren't identical
01:14  l4rk: http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
01:15  Maxdamantus: js> eval("4+5"); function eval(a){ return a; }
01:15  gbot2: Maxdamantus: "4+5"
01:15  Maxdamantus: js> eval("4+5"); var eval = function(a){ return a; }
01:15  gbot2: Maxdamantus: Error: TypeError: eval is not a function
01:16  Maxdamantus: Meh.
01:16  Maxdamantus: Oh, oops.
01:16  gkatsev: lol
01:16  Maxdamantus: js> var e = eval("4+5"); var eval = function(a){ return a; }; e;
01:16  gbot2: Maxdamantus: Error: TypeError: eval is not a function
01:16  Maxdamantus: What?
01:17  gkatsev: it has to do with code hoisting
01:17  Maxdamantus: Are you allowed to declare a variable after you use it?
01:17  gkatsev: s/code/var/
01:17  gkatsev: you can declare a var after usage; however, you will not get the value of it.
01:17  gkatsev: `ref mdc hoisting
01:17  v8bot: gkatsev: Scope Cheatsheet - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Scope_Cheatsheet
01:19  Maxdamantus: lol
01:19  gkatsev: function statements get hoisted along with value
01:19 * Maxdamantus never uses var anywhere but on the global scope, or at the top of a function.
01:19  gkatsev: which is why it is recommended to declare all vars at the top of a function
01:25  Maxdamantus: gkatsev: so what were you saying before regarding the global object, and `this`?
01:26  gkatsev: what /was/ I saying?
01:26  Maxdamantus: 12:44:03 < gkatsev> (function(){ return (function(){ return this;})();}() should return the context of the first function
01:30  gkatsev: js> this ==  (function(){ return (function(){ return this;})();}()
01:30  gbot2: gkatsev: Error: SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical:  this ==  (function(){ return (function(){ return this;})();}()  .............................................................^
01:30  Auv5: Pastebin is your friend?
01:30  Auv5: Oh, nvm :P
01:30  Maxdamantus:  js> this ==  (function(){ return (function(){ return this;})();})()
01:30  Maxdamantus: js> this ==  (function(){ return (function(){ return this;})();})()
01:30  gbot2: Maxdamantus: true
01:30  gkatsev: oh, yeah, forgot a paren
01:33  kicken: js> function t(){ this.m=function(){ return (function(){ return this; })(); } }; var x=new t(); this==x.m();
01:33  gbot2: kicken: true

01:44  dAnjou: hey, is document width always the same as window width? (or am i totally wrong here?)
01:45  Maxdamantus: No.
01:45  dAnjou: Maxdamantus: what could be the difference?
01:45  Maxdamantus: If the body is thinner than the document.
01:45  Maxdamantus: What do you mean by document width exactly, and window width?
01:46  v8bot: gkatsev: true
01:46  dAnjou: the objects in the dom tree
01:46  gkatsev: v8: 'foo'
01:46  v8bot: gkatsev: "foo"
01:47  Pilum: Window width will almost always be wider than the document's width on account of the UI.
01:47  Maxdamantus: Mmm, that too.
01:47  Pilum: Assuming you didn't somehow design it so you have horizontal scrollbars (which is bad).
01:48  dAnjou: Pilum: but i tested window and document width and height and both values were the same in google chrome
01:48  Pilum: And how did you obtain those values?
01:49  dAnjou: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/296859/
01:49  dAnjou: jquery
01:49  Maxdamantus: How does jQuery get them?
01:50  Pilum: My question exactly.
01:50  dAnjou: hmm, don't know .. will test it with plain js
01:52  Maxdamantus: Try document.body.style.width = "5px";
01:54  dabear: jquery uses currentStyle (ie) and getComputedStyle elsewhere
02:02  dAnjou: hmm, seems to be a pretty messed up thing
02:02  dAnjou: what should i use to get the width of the current viewport?
02:03  dAnjou: i mean just the website, not the brower stuff around
02:03  Maxdamantus: Why would you want to?
02:05  Maxdamantus: I'd say usually the applications that want to know that would have zero padding on body, and try and ensure the size of body is greater or equal to the size of the viewport.
02:05  Maxdamantus: Then you can use document.body.clientWidth
02:06  Pilum: Totally pointless to use JS for that anyway. It's trivial to design for it using CSS.
02:06  dAnjou: hmm, don't know if i got your point
02:07  Maxdamantus: Why do you actually want to know?
02:07  dAnjou: i need it, to move an element out of the visible area
02:07  dAnjou: using jquery
02:07  Maxdamantus: So they can still scroll to it?
02:07  dAnjou: no
02:07  Maxdamantus: So why not just make it hidden?
02:07  gkatsev: display: none, visibility: false or something like that
02:07  Maxdamantus: display: none
02:08  Maxdamantus: Meh.
02:08  dAnjou: i want to animate it
02:08  Maxdamantus: While it's hidden?
02:08  gkatsev: you can animate using css
02:08  Maxdamantus: Oh, animate it in?
02:08  Maxdamantus: Yeah, CSS, position: absolute
02:08 --- perlite_ is now known as perlite
02:08  Maxdamantus: Then change left/right depending on which way you want it to fly in.
02:09  dAnjou: ok, let's start over again .. and be concrete
02:09  dAnjou: i want to "fly out" a DIV
02:10  dAnjou: and i don't want to move it to -3000px, cause this is not elegant
02:11  dAnjou: and i can't do it with only CSS, because i want to have control over it
02:13  dAnjou: and that's why i need to know the dimensions of the visible area
02:14  dAnjou: hello?
02:14  gkatsev: window.innerWidth window.innerHeight
02:14  gkatsev: assuming you are not on IE, I think IE has different stuff
02:16  dAnjou: gkatsev: and i can't take document.width?
02:16  dAnjou: what's the difference?
02:17  fruitwerks: IE sucks
02:18  gkatsev: dAnjou: they are not the same thing. window.inneWidth/innerHeight will give you the size of the viewport. document will give you something else
02:18  gkatsev: depending on whether you have scrollbars and stuff
02:19  dAnjou: hmm
02:20  gkatsev: though, it's possible that the only difference is scrollbars, i'm not terrible sure.
02:20  gkatsev: terribly
02:25  dAnjou: i don't care about scrollbare, cause they will almost never be hundreds of pixels broad
02:25  gkatsev: `ref mdc document.width
02:25  v8bot: gkatsev: document.width - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.width
02:25  gkatsev: dAnjou: do you care about IE support?
02:26  gkatsev: `ref mdc window.innerWidth
02:26  v8bot: gkatsev: window.innerWidth - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.innerWidth
02:27  houdini: How can I set focus event on body in iframe in designMode? Actually I need event when user set cursor in iframe
02:30  dAnjou: gkatsev: i care about w3c compliance
02:32  dAnjou: and unfortunatly both are not part of any w3c specification or standard
02:33  dAnjou: but i will use jquery with the window object
02:33  dAnjou: seems to be the best choice
02:38  Maxdamantus: dAnjou: then set the body to no padding, 100% width/height.
02:38  Maxdamantus: and use document.body.client{Width,Height}
02:40  dAnjou: had almost the same idea by using a 100% div inside body
02:42 --- joo is now known as joo|afk
02:48  Carlitos__: hi all
03:01  ExorcistToGo: Why is && referred to as the guard operator?
03:01 --- joo|afk is now known as joo
03:03  Carlitos__: is  this possible  to use  1 combo list and 2 input  for dates ?  I am using  3  combos list  here  http://pastebin.com/h2mhcj32,  how  can I  change  this thanks
03:03  buubot: Carlitos__:  The 59 line paste h2mhcj32 has been copied to http://nopaste.snit.ch/26212  .
03:07  hwk2|1: how can i include other js file from a single js file?
03:08  preaction: hwk2|1: add a <script> tag to the current document
03:08  hwk2|1: well got 5 of those. i want only one which includes all of them
03:08  hwk2|1: is it possible?
03:09  hwk2|1: <script src="base.js"></script>
03:09  preaction: of course. create a file that creates the script tags in the document. or use a preprocessor to merge the files and maybe even minify them, or just concat them yourself
03:09  hwk2|1: and that base.js would have include script1.js; include script2.js
03:09 --- peshalto_ is now known as peshalto
03:09  preaction: there's no such thing as "include"
03:10  preaction: why not do what YUI 3's loader does, which is add <script> tags to the document
03:10  hwk2|1: bleah
03:10  hwk2|1: inside dom?
03:10  preaction: or use a server-side language to concatenate files, or contcatenate them yourself
03:10  preaction: three choices, that's it. three possible choices. choose one.
03:11  hwk2|1: too complicated. ill stick to simpliest one
03:11  hwk2|1: script for each file
03:11  Carlitos__: is this possible  to get a  value  like a  date, ComboIdctaValue = ComboIdcta.options[ComboIdcta.selectedIndex].value  , because I use  a drop-down list any help to  change this ?
03:11  preaction: Carlitos__: new Date( ComboIdctaValue )
03:12  Carlitos__: but I want to change date like 2010-01-22 for  example I have  a input
03:13  ExorcistToGo: I just read Eloquent Javascript, there is a good section on that Chapter 9: Modularity
03:13  ExorcistToGo: http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter9.html
03:16  systemfault: Harmony looks nice... sucks that we won't get to use it before 2050...
03:17  fatbrain: Harmony?
03:17  hwk2|1: jquery help here?
03:17  systemfault: The codename of the  next version of javascript
03:17  systemfault: fatbrain: http://brendaneich.com/
03:17  fatbrain: ok
03:17  systemfault: See his last blog post.
03:18  ExorcistToGo: systemfault: What was the war about that caused this?
03:18  systemfault: v8bot: odds = [i for (i in range(20)) if (i % 2)]
03:18  v8bot: systemfault: Use v8: <code> to evaluate code or "`v commands" for a list of v8bot commands.
03:19  systemfault: v8:[i for (i in range(20)) if (i % 2)]
03:19  v8bot: systemfault: SyntaxError: Unexpected token for
03:20  systemfault: hwk2|1: I didn't check but.. you could check if there's a jquery channel on freenode.
03:21  systemfault: Yea.... with 600 users.
03:22  cheney: how can I use javascript to retrieve post data, I am already aware I will need a server side JS interpreter to execute the JS
03:24  ExorcistToGo: Russell said what "died" with the announcement of the Harmony effort was not Adobe's attempt to "own" a specification. "What died was an assumption that the Web can evolve without implementations being out in front of the spec. ( This statement is pretty well ... critical of what worked in the past IMHO )
03:25  systemfault: Well.. let's be honest, what good thing came out from the w3c? :P
03:25  systemfault: There's.... none.
03:25  systemfault: CSS sucks, html sucks.
03:26  systemfault: Javascript sucks less.. but it's because it wasn't made by the w3c
03:26  systemfault: afaik.
03:26  Carlitos__: hi  all
03:26  Carlitos__: is  this  correct ?
03:26  Carlitos__: ComboYear = document.getElementById("year")
03:26  cheney: systemfault: XML rocks
03:26  Carlitos__: 	ComboYearValue = ComboYear.options[selIndex].text;
03:26  systemfault: svg... it was invented.. like 15 years ago and it's still a dead technology
03:26  systemfault: cheney: XML is a joke.
03:27  systemfault: cheney: They managed to make a mess from something as simple as xml.
03:27  cheney: systemfault: how so?
03:27  systemfault: xpath... xslt.. etc.
03:27  cheney: systemfault: xpath kicks ass
03:27  cheney: systemfault: xml xchema kicks more ass
03:27 * systemfault pukes.
03:28  systemfault: Even JSON despite having no schema sucks far less than xml imho.
03:28  cheney: I am guessing you have not written many original markup languages then
03:28  ExorcistToGo: systemfault: I love xpath and xquery. :)  Well do I .... trying to see a better way to do things here.
03:28  systemfault: I'm not a fan of markup languages :)
03:28  cheney: json does not serve the same purpose as xml, which leads me to believe you do not understand xml as well you think you do
03:29  systemfault: XML does more than JSON.
03:29  cheney: systemfault: you are probably not a fan of markup languages because you have not been exposed to many
03:29  systemfault: In fact, I think it does too much.
03:29  Carlitos__: is  this correct ?
03:30  ExorcistToGo: systemfault: You would really love XAML then!
03:30  cheney: Carlitos__: you want .value instead of .text
03:30 * ExorcistToGo goes on record as hating XAML.
03:30  systemfault: cheney: I was avoiding the web like plague before finding a job as a web developper...
03:30  systemfault: XAML is actually a "good idea"
03:30  systemfault: Splitting GUI and code is a nice thing.
03:31  Carlitos__: ok
03:31  maushu__: I hate xml though.
03:31  cheney: at any rate i wrote an original markup language that is capable of being reduced to raw data and has result in a patent application
03:31  maushu__: With the fury of one thousand suns.
03:32  cheney: as a result I love xml schema, because of what you can do with it from an analytical and application perspective
03:32  cheney: good luck trying to reduce html to relational data with any amount of consistency
03:32  maushu__: cheney, have you tried json?
03:33  cheney: maushu__: what does json have to do with xml
03:33  maushu__: Both can be used in similar ways.
03:33  systemfault: cheney: XML can do everything JSON do
03:33  maushu__: But XML is more verbose.
03:33  Carlitos__: pls what's wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/WpFZQ2Hh
03:33  buubot: Carlitos__:  The 26 line paste WpFZQ2Hh has been copied to   .
03:33  cheney: json is an extensibly tiered key/value pair and nothing more
03:34  Carlitos__: I can not make it work properly
03:34  maushu__: cheney, it's also recursive and can have arrays.
03:34  Carlitos__: sorry for  my english
03:34  cheney: json != xml
03:34  cheney: the two have nothing in common
03:34  fatbrain: they are both langauges :P
03:34  fatbrain: well played fatbrain... well played...
03:34  cheney: when people attempt to make any such comparison they are exposing their ignorance
03:34  ExorcistToGo: The idea that XML is just some sort of verbose S-Expression is something I cringe at everytime I hear it. Have not heard it yet here.
03:35  cheney: maushu__: arrays are key/value pairs as well with the index being a positive integer opposed to a string
03:35  maushu__: The difference is that json doesn't name the nodes.
03:36  cheney: maushu__: actually, JSON does name the nodes if you assign a child object/array as a value to a key in an object literal
03:37  maushu__: Wouldn't work for xml structure.
03:37  ExorcistToGo: Does JSON have a way to represent nulls? ( I have not used JSON ) Just curious.
03:37  cheney: maushu__: why not?
03:37  Carlitos__: sorry this is my  code but no idea  where can I fix it ?   http://pastebin.com/Lk7UQeM4
03:37  buubot: Carlitos__:  The 27 line paste Lk7UQeM4 has been copied to   .
03:37  maushu__: ExorcistToGo, http://www.json.org/
03:38  maushu__: Check the value section.
03:38  cheney: ExorcistToGo: no, JSON is only capable of representing string and number data types
03:38  cheney: and undefined if you count that as a third type
03:38  maushu__: cheney, actually, it can use strings, numbers, true, false, nulls, arrays, and objects.
03:39  maushu__: The type "object" allows recursion.
03:39  ExorcistToGo: I see it in the spec. value can be string, number, object, array, true, faslt or yes even null.
03:40  cheney: maushu__: at any rate JSON is only data, and xml is not
03:40  Carlitos__: no idea :D
03:40  cheney: apples and oranges
03:41  Carlitos__: how  to fix it :)
03:41  maushu__: json can also be metadata.
03:41  cheney: how do you define a meta data structure in JSON apart from data values?
03:41  systemfault: XML does way more than JSON.
03:41  systemfault: It does TOO MUCH.
03:42  maushu__: cheney, the way you want. There are no standards about it.
03:42  systemfault: Oh.. And it's also weirdly hard to parse.
03:42  cheney: maushu__: that is not a rational answer to a technical question
03:42  systemfault: How would you store binary data with JSON?
03:43  maushu__: BSON.
03:43  systemfault: I know it can be done with XML
03:43  maushu__: It can also be done the same way as xml.
03:43  maushu__: But better use BSON.
03:43  Carlitos__: thanks cheney
03:47  ExorcistToGo: systemfault: Can you give me an example of the category of stuff in XML you think is too much? ( This does interest me) I realize this is a javascript channel though
03:49  ExorcistToGo: Maybe they left too much of SGML in it? That sort of thing?
03:49  systemfault: ExorcistToGo: Bah... You need tons of tools + languages to use it
03:49  systemfault: XSL/XSLT/XPath/XQuery/XPointer/XLink...
03:49  cheney: naw, xml displays in the browser
03:49  systemfault: And probably other that I missed.
03:50  cheney: and most foundational xml languages work in most browsers
03:50  ExorcistToGo: systemfault: perhaps the way boundaries are defined between seperations of concern is the issue?
03:54  ExorcistToGo: I myself do not think that XPath really should be a part of a standard. It is crazy that it is. I can only imagine the wars that there were over it.
03:54  cheney: why? xpath absolutely rules
03:55  cheney: it is so much faster and more specific than DOM methods and the craziness used in CSS
03:55  ExorcistToGo: I agree that xpath rules. Just don't like the idea of a query language standard having to be specified as part of a data exchange specification.
03:55  mauke: xpath sucks less than css selectors, that's about it
03:56  ExorcistToGo: The sad thing is that xpath may be the best part of XML :)
03:56  cheney: naw, i still put my money on schema
03:59  ExorcistToGo: then again xpath injection is a problem also :/
04:05  ExorcistToGo: Is there any JavaScript framework that implments something like xpath to do selector functions?

14:56  philsturgeon: hi guys . i have a fairly confusing problem introduced to some stable code when I converted it over from procedural to OOP javascript. the method causing problems is here http://d.pr/KNPj
14:57  philsturgeon: it can all be seen in action here http://travlrapp.com/philsturgeon/bristol-london-2010 you'll notice the console.debug running and outputting null on page load. more errors if you click "Bristol"
14:57  philsturgeon: im basically failing to get the variable info set from the callback and assigned to this.places[place.id]['info']
15:03  sonu: Hello
15:03  sonu: I am getting this error
15:03  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: have you declared info?
15:04  Maxdamantus: Because if not, it'll be using the "info" property of the global object
15:04  sonu: I am using mootools slider
15:04  sonu: but getting addEvent error
15:04  sonu: error is window.addEvent is not a function
15:04  sonu: any idea?
15:04  Maxdamantus: which means if you've got multiple instances of this object, they're sharing the same `info` variable, and you do have `info = null;` at the top.
15:05  molgrew: sonu: you haven't defined addEvent in the right place
15:05  Pilum: sonu: You don't have addEvent declared at that point.
15:06  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: yeah im setting info = null, then i want to get the value from the callback, but of course im only defining the callback there not actually running it
15:06  philsturgeon: i know its badly coupled code, but i dont know a better way to try and do it
15:06  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: but you're not declaring it afaics
15:06  Maxdamantus: (Looking at that paste, I haven't bothered to look at the page yet)
15:07  axscode: is there a way that i can disable the page for not to be clickable untill the page is totally loaded
15:07  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: the paste covers it
15:07  philsturgeon: in the paste i was assigning it to a global array, but that was litteral so i could just call the array
15:07  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: again, if you've got two instances of whatever `this` is meant to be, they're sharing the same `info` variable.
15:07  philsturgeon: now im having to use this to talk to the global properties, but ofc in a callback this becomes a refference to the callback
15:08  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: i dont thin i have two refferences of it
15:08  Maxdamantus: The paste doesn't cover it, because I can't see where info is declared.
15:08  philsturgeon: info is not a property of the class
15:08  Maxdamantus: Meh, I'll look at the page.
15:08  Pilum: `classes @ philsturgeon
15:08  jsBot: philsturgeon: classes: There are *no* 'classes' in Javascript.  Javascript uses prototypical OO: objects are constructed directly, based on other objects, without a blueprint.  Thinking of constructor functions as classes is *wrong,* and will confuse you in the long term.
15:08  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: http://travlrapp.com/javascripts/trip.js?1290948540
15:09  philsturgeon: Pilate: cool, im not using constructors
15:09  Maxdamantus: Yeah, you're not declaring info
15:09  philsturgeon: i'll admit that im a PHP guy trying this in a PHP way but i think i just about get the OO approach. im just crap with callbacks :)
15:09  Pilum: Yes you are heh,
15:09  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: info is not meant to be a global property
15:09  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: then declare it.
15:10  Pilum: You still need to declare it
15:10  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: if you don't declare it, it becomes a global property.
15:10  philsturgeon: var info = null?
15:10  Maxdamantus: Sure.
15:10  philsturgeon: stil null, because the callback is not called at this point
15:11  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: where is place declared?
15:11  philsturgeon: in the callback i have info = trip.map.info(marker, contentString) which i was hoping would grab it, but callbacks dont do that. i need to define the callback and assign the value of trip.map.info(marker, contentString) somewhere global
15:11  philsturgeon: it used to be trip.places[id].info = trip.map.info(marker, contentString) in the callback, which put the value in a global property
15:12  philsturgeon: but i cant get to the global property in the callback as this becomes a refference to the callback
15:12  sonu: Pilum, how can I do this?
15:12  Maxdamantus: Oh, place is a parameter of theu function.
15:12  philsturgeon: and even though im doing var trip = this to READ the trip properties, i cant write to it
15:13  philsturgeon: i miss references :)
15:13  sonu: I am using this line : window.addEvent('domready', function(){
15:13  Pilum: sonu: That line calls it. But it needs to be *defined* somewhere.
15:13  philsturgeon: i know this is al probablt overcomplicating matters, but this will be JS heavy and i'll be repeating a LOT of code if i try it with simple procedural code
15:13  sonu: Pilum , how and where can I define that?
15:14  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: I'm not sure what your objective is with the way you've written set_info
15:14  sonu: sorry, I am bit new for Javascript?
15:14  sonu: :(
15:14  Pilum: Very new apparently.
15:14  sonu: yup
15:14  Maxdamantus: You declare and set info to null, then you set this.places[place.id]["info"] to null
15:14  Pilum: `eloquent @ sonu
15:14  jsBot: sonu: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
15:14  sonu: can you guide me for first time?
15:14  Pilum: Learn.
15:14  Maxdamantus: Then you return a function that sets info, pointlessly.
15:14  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: yeah, thats where its falling over heh
15:14  Pilum: As for addEvent, I don't know whether mootools defines that or not.
15:15  sonu: Pilum, they don't otherwise I don't have that error in firebug
15:15  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: maybe you meant to assign to trip.places[place.id].info inside the function, not info?
15:15  philsturgeon: this line: info = trip.map.info(marker, contentString) is the problem. it needs to create a callback, and i need to assign the actual object to a global array so i can refference it later
15:15  Maxdamantus: trip.places[place.id].info = trip.map.info(marker, contentString);
15:15  philsturgeon: yes, but then it is only available once the callback is called
15:15  Pilum: That depends on whether you include it properly. :-<9
15:15  Pilum: :-)
15:15  philsturgeon: i need it available from when the callback is defined
15:16  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: note that the code inside the callback function is not executed until after the code at the end of the set_info function.
15:16  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: besides, this.places[place.id]['info'] = trip.map.info(marker, contentString) would not worl
15:16  philsturgeon: this is the callback, not the "class"
15:16  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: I said trip.places..
15:16  philsturgeon: trip.places would modify the copy of the class
15:16  philsturgeon: it wont write anything
15:17  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: copy of what?
15:17  Pilum: Again, philsturgeon, don't think in terms of classes when you're writing JS.
15:17  sonu: hmm
15:17  Pilum: No wonder you're being confused if you do that.
15:17  philsturgeon: var trip = this is used to read properties and methods
15:17  sonu: which part i need to read for it
15:17  philsturgeon: but, i cant change anything in trip and have it affect "this"
15:17  Pilum: sonu: All of it. From beginning to end.
15:17  philsturgeon: because it is just a copy
15:17  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: it will affect `this`
15:17  Maxdamantus: Because they're the same object.
15:18  Maxdamantus: An object's value does not represent the entire object.
15:18  Maxdamantus: It's probably easiest to think of an object's value as a reference to a set of key-value pairs.
15:18  philsturgeon: ahh right
15:18  Maxdamantus: So when you do `trip = this` you're just copying a reference. They both point to the same set of key-value pairs.
15:19  philsturgeon: well thats progress, just getting "this.open_info is null" now >.<
15:19  philsturgeon: so out of my depth its not even funny!
15:22  Maxdamantus: philsturgeon: in show_place?
15:23 * Maxdamantus can't see where show_place is called.
15:24  Maxdamantus: Ah, trip.show_place($(this).closest('tr').attr('id').replace(/place-/, ''))
15:24  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: yeah show_place will have that error. i am outputting the place = this.places[id] and .info property is missing
15:24  philsturgeon: and its called from outside
15:24  philsturgeon: yeah :)
15:24 --- qFxo is now known as qFox
15:25  philsturgeon: its confusing as hell. i need to create callbacks for all the actions and i need all the data available for reference from outside and by other functions

15:26  philsturgeon: Maxdamantus: in show_info. it is the currently open object

15:48  philsturgeon: before i was seeing null, now im just not getting it called, ever
15:48  Maxdamantus: You said the error was that this.open_info was null iirc
15:48  philsturgeon: on load it should set all of them. none of them contain the info key
15:50  philsturgeon: that seems to be another issue. im lost in this spaghetti code >.<
15:50  philsturgeon: seems like that might be error #2, but error #1 is that i never set the info key properly in that array

16:03  Pilum: For finding out if it's in the string, yes. Wouldn't tell you if it's at the end of the string.
16:03  molgrew: lastIndexOf is better
16:03  Pilum: Strictly speaking anyway. Nor would lastIndexOf.
16:04  Pilum: You could run some comparisons but, as I said, that'd be more work than a regexp test.

17:13  Spektrum: hello
17:15  Spektrum: When I try to change the inner html of a node with a cyrillic text I'm getting question marks instead of proper characters. Is there any way to fix that?
17:17  joelennon: Have you set the correct character set for your HTML document?
17:18  webben: Spektrum: Got a http://sscce.org/ ?
17:23  Spektrum: joelennon: do you mean a "<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js" charset="utf-8"></script>"?
17:23  Spektrum: if so, yes
17:24  joelennon: What about the HTML document itself? Do you have a <meta charset="utf-8"> or equivalent tag in there? Remember that any changes you make using innerHTML are applied to the DOM, which will take the character set of the HTML document, not the <script> block.
17:26  Spektrum: when i open script in a browser all cyrillic strings are displayed incorrectly
17:26  Spektrum: http://searchandwatch.appspot.com/script.js
17:30  joelennon: That's because your browser is set to use a Latin encoding. Try change your browser's text encoding setting to Cyrillic and it should look right. It should work fine if you use that script in a UTF-8 HTML document.
17:31  joelennon: If it doesn't you could set your HTML document to use a cyrillic character set.
18:11  swine__: hey, how can i populate a pulldown menu without using an onchange event ?

18:58  molgrew: what do you mean?
18:59  swine__: i want javascript to populate a pulldown within a webpage
18:59  swine__: so i stuck in an empty image within the gif
18:59  swine__: er within the div
18:59  swine__: and attached an onLoad handler
18:59  swine__: how do i pass the onload handler a reference to the pulldown menu that's contained within the div ?
19:01  molgrew: you can't, you have to get one inside it
19:01  swine__: so how do i generate an event for the menu ?
19:02  swine__: i want it populated before anything happens
19:02  swine__: the only thing i could find was 'onclick'
19:02  swine__: but you have to click the thing first
19:02  swine__: which kind of sucks
19:02  molgrew: could you explain in some more detail what you mean now?
19:03  swine__: i would like to populate a pulldown menu from javascrip
19:03  swine__: t
19:03  swine__: that's pretty clear isn't it ?
19:03  Pilate: why not populate it when the document is done loading
19:03  molgrew: pulldown menu = select? yes, so much is clear
19:03  swine__: Pilate, that's fine. i just don't understand how to pass in a reference to the pulldown to a js function
19:04  swine__: unless i'm actually in the pulldown itself
19:04  swine__: i don't understand how to reference the pulldown. it's probably a really basic question
19:05  Pilate: the easiest way of getting it is adding an id, and refrencing via getElementById
19:05  molgrew: just to be clear, you do mean a select element?

19:19  molgrew: I mean "everything", or at least "enough", not just bits and pieces of the html+code+goal
19:20  swine__: molgrew, it looks like getElementsByName may do it
19:20  swine__: but it returns a linked list
19:20  swine__: i don't understand how to manipulate this stuff in js
19:21  webben: swine__: "can't names be shared across multiple elements". They can.
19:21  swine__: so how do i use this function
19:21  swine__: grrrr
19:22  swine__: webben, can i call getElementById first
19:22  webben: swine__: You can combine the many DOM traversing functions and properties to walk and filter the DOM however you like.
19:23  swine__: webben, i don't understand how to deal with linked lists in javascript
19:23  swine__: let's say i call getElementsByName
19:23  webben: swine__: Without knowing the particular constraints of your particular DOM, suggesting the optimal way to query the DOM is fairly futile.
19:23  swine__: how do i traverse this data ?
19:23  webben: swine__: Learn how to deal with arrays in JS.
19:23  swine__: webben, well the select lives within a div
19:23  swine__: webben, it's an array or a linked list ?
19:23  webben: swine__: (It's not an actual array, but it behaves similarly.)
19:23  swine__: the documentation implies that it's a linked list
19:24  webben: swine__: Which documentation?
19:24  swine__: the link you sent me
19:24  webben: swine__: The HTML5 link?
19:25  swine__: webben, whatever documentation link you sent me
19:25  swine__: it says it's a NodeList
19:25  swine__: that sounds like some kind of linked list to me
19:25  webben: swine__: Well, it's a NodeList. I don't think calling it a linked list helps.
19:25  swine__: wtf is a NodeList ?
19:25  webben: I suspect it's not an accurate name for it.
19:25  swine__: that's some kind of data structure isn't it ?
19:25  webben: swine__: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#ID-536297177
19:26  webben: swine__: You can iterate through them using a normal JS for loop.
19:26  webben: swine__: Note the point about it being "live".
19:27  webben: swine__: E.g. if you delete a node from the DOM, the NodeList can change and so the node at given index in the nodelist can be different.
19:28  webben: swine__: I don't think it's correct to call a NodeList a linked list, since individual items don't have a pointer to the next item in the list (in general).
19:28  webben: swine__: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/NodeList is a nice writeup
19:29  swine__: it should be item 0 in this case ...
19:29  swine__: so i wouldn't even need to loop
19:30  webben: Can't answer that without knowing your DOM and how it varies, but your statements are not implausible.

20:24  systemfault: Perhaps a scope problem...
20:25  FireFly|n900: swine__, correct scope?
20:25  swine__: FireFly, it's in the same document
20:25  FireFly|n900: yes?
20:25  swine__: FireFly, the javascript stuff is at the top of the page
20:25  FireFly|n900: each function is a different scope
20:25  swine__: FireFly, it was working before too
20:25  eboyjr: paste your code
20:25  eboyjr: `code
20:25  gbot2: Show some code.  Code examples should be complete (sufficient to show the problem) and minimal (as short as possible while remaining complete).
20:25  swine__: FireFly, i don't undersstand what happened
20:25  FireFly|n900: I'm no magician either
20:25  swine__: eboyjr, there is a lot of code to paste
20:26  swine__: but i'm callin git like this:
20:26  swine__: <select name=wavelength onchange="changeList(this)">
20:26  eboyjr: wait
20:26  eboyjr: `pastebin
20:26  FireFly|n900: Mhm
20:26  swine__: eboyjr, pastebin what ? there's way too much code to pastebin the whole thing
20:26  eboyjr: Go to pastie.org and paste all of it there
20:26  FireFly|n900: And it's defined like how?
20:26  carlocci: `minimal @ swine__
20:26  gbot2: swine__: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
20:26  swine__: <script language="javascript">
20:26  swine__: function changeList( box ) {
20:26  swine__:  
20:26  swine__: etc
20:26  eboyjr: swine__: Do it anyway :p What about a URL?
20:27  swine__: if i could make a minimal test case i would understand the problem
20:27  webben: swine__: Exactly!
20:27  swine__: the code was working 10 minutes ago
20:27  webben: And that's why one should make a minimal test case.
20:27  FireFly|n900: Well, what did you do?
20:27  swine__: i didn't do anything that in my understanding would break anything
20:27  swine__: i don't get it
20:28  eboyjr: hrm well too bad
20:28  FireFly|n900: ctrl+z?
20:28  eboyjr: !next
20:28  swine__: FireFly|n900, what could possibly cause this error ?
20:28  FireFly|n900: Go on from a working copy, one thing at a time?
20:28  webben: swine__: Revert your changes. Make each individual change until you produce the error.
20:28  swine__: FireFly, how could the function not be in scope
20:28  james13433: eboyjr I did that but got "that is not defined" do I have to pass it in ?
20:28  FireFly|n900: That it isn't defined
20:28  swine__: this doesn't make SENSE
20:28  FireFly|n900: is all I could imagine
20:28  carlocci: script language="javascript" ?
20:29  eboyjr: not sure
20:29  swine__: carlocci, what's wrong with that ?
20:29  FireFly|n900: swine__, it could be deletes
20:29  FireFly|n900: d*
20:29  FireFly|n900: global scope == window == this in global scope
20:30  swine__: FireFly|n900, this isn't helping
20:30  swine__: FireFly|n900, it should be globally scopted
20:30  swine__: FireFly|n900, why is it giving me this stupid error ?
20:31  FireFly|n900: Take it easy
20:31  carlocci: <script type="text/javascript">
20:31  FireFly|n900: I can't really guess your code
20:31  swine__: carlocci, i already changed it. doesn't matter
20:31  olasol: how I can know how are ordered the elements, I mean, know to wich place the elements where moved from his original positions in something like this http://pastebin.com/uq1AL7xD
20:31  buubot: olasol:  The 9 line paste uq1AL7xD has been copied to   .
20:31  FireFly|n900: The only tip I can give you is to ctrl+z back and go on slowly from a working copy
20:31  carlocci: What do you expect?
20:31  carlocci: that we guess your problem?
20:32  swine__: FireFly|n900, i'm not asking you to guess my code. i'm asking someone to explain is how it can be anything but global ?
20:32  swine__: it's the first things after <body>
20:32  webben: swine__: Speculating wildly is a waste of time.
20:32  FireFly|n900: I told you it could be deleted
20:32  swine__: isn't this going to be  f*cking global ?
20:32  FireFly|n900: I told you it could be deleted
20:32  swine__: FireFly|n900, deleted ?
20:32  swine__: FireFly|n900, what does that mean /
20:32  webben: swine__: Maybe you have an error, maybe you overwrite the function variable, maybe you've actually defined it inside another scope.
20:33  swine__: webben, it's only defined in one place
20:33  webben: swine__: Try removing everything after the <script> in question, then calling the function.
20:33  FireFly|n900: js> var foo = 42; delete this.foo: foo // swine__
20:33  gbot2: FireFly|n900: Error: SyntaxError: invalid label:  var foo = 42; delete this.foo: foo // swine__  ..........................^
20:33  systemfault: Anyway.. that kind of onClick handler sucks.
20:33  james13433: eboyjr if I pass that in it messes us this "this.readAttribute is not a function"
20:33  swine__: webben, why would i do that. it's definitey going to be undefined if i do that
20:34  webben: swine__: After the script that defines it I mean, not just after the opening tag.
20:34  swine__: webben, what are you suggesting that i do ?
20:35  webben: swine__: <!doctype html><title></title><body><script>your script here</script><script>try to call the function here</script>
20:35  webben: you might need more for a minimal test, but I can't see your code and I ain't clairvoyant.
20:35  swine__: ok, i'll try

20:41  apeiros: what's the canonical way to check whether an object is an Array? `obj instanceof Array`, `obj.constructor == Array` or even something else?
20:41  swine__: it was an extra curly bracket
20:41  swine__: holy f*ck
20:48  noobie25: if i have multiple scripts,   i'm unclear how i can access variables/functions "across the different scripts.   i posted a sample:  http://pastie.org/1330526
20:52  james13433: if I have both $('image').writeAttribute("src",src); 	and	         that.scale(1); will the first always complete before running the second line?
20:52  kicken: noobie25, script tags aren't isolated.  You can think of them as just one giant script tag.
20:53  noobie25: kicken: so i should be able to access all variables from above right?
20:53  kicken: yes
20:53  carlocci: no
20:54  noobie25: kicken: do i have to declare a function before using it...or just append them at the end still works fine?
20:55  kicken: It's good pratice to declare it before using it.  I dont think it's necessarily required.
20:55  carlocci: after the first script is run, the identifier a refer to the function object, the same happens with the second script
20:55  Pilum: Sometimes it is required.
20:55  noobie25: kicken: i thin i had ran into a situation where i cannot access a variable....it should work....... let me post a pastie.
20:55  carlocci: also you can't access b from the first script
20:56  kicken: noobie25, in your particular example, what carlocci said is true.  you can't have a function and a variable of the same name, they conflict.
20:56  carlocci: because the interpreter doesn't even know that the second script exists, let alone what's inside it
20:57  noobie25: thanks carlocci and kicken...

22:11  draginx: Why does my .length report a different length than PHP's strlen() function?
22:12  eboyjr: Because the string is different

22:16  Guest8698: I have a script that updates the src of an image, I need to wait till the new images is loaded before running some more code, how would I do that?
22:16  draginx: eboyjr: how can I make them the same?
22:16  eboyjr: draginx: I don't know why they are different...
22:16  eboyjr: `code
22:16  gbot2: Show some code.  Code examples should be complete (sufficient to show the problem) and minimal (as short as possible while remaining complete).
22:16  eboyjr: Guest8698: img.src = "blah"; img.onload = function() { blah(); this.onload = null; }
22:17  draginx: eboyjr: http://pastie.org/private/junnf0jtndjxlcdzxdnjdg
22:17  Guest8698: "that.imageEl.onload is not a function" thats what I thought but got that error for some reason
22:18  eboyjr: You don't call onload()
22:19  Guest8698: ahh ok I see now thanks eboyjr
22:19  eboyjr: draginx: you absolutely NEED to use json_encode() to pass PHP variables to Javascript, always.
22:19  draginx: eboyjr: I'm not passing json data..
22:19  draginx: just simply an integer
22:21  eboyjr: draginx: Still, use json_encode... what if it is undefined? You will get var blah = ;
22:21  draginx: it will *never* be undefined
22:21  draginx: the code is right
22:21  draginx: the functions calculate differently
22:21  draginx: im trying to figure out exactly *where*
22:22  eboyjr: One is mb_strlen and one is strlen
22:23  eboyjr: What does h() do?
22:23  draginx: Right mb_strlen is only when dealing with utf8- i utf8_decode
22:23  draginx: h = htmlspecialchars
22:23  draginx: but im not using h to calculate >< only to present data
22:24  draginx: http://www.lettercount.com/ when I copy + paste the var_dump of $sql->data[1] I get "301" rather than "308"
22:25  Guest8698: eboyjr you made my life much easier twice today - so thank you very much.
22:25  eboyjr: You want htmlentities() instead for that
22:25  eboyjr: twice? np
22:25  eboyjr: youre welcome
22:25  draginx: eboyjr: that doesnt solve the current problem that i'm dealing with though
22:25  Guest8698: boyjr - yer before you told me to add this as a var ethat
22:26  eboyjr: draginx: What is and contents of $sql->data[1]
22:26  eboyjr: ah
22:26  draginx: eboyjr: string(308) "Never really had a problem with this before but ... Your message may only be up to 4,000 characters long. Would be good to have a character counter next to the "Post New Thread" button just so we can know we aren't going over the max characters. Spent ages cutting down my post and ended up giving up."
22:26  eboyjr: s/and/the/ what am i thinking
22:26  draginx: as u can see PHP says 308 but JS everywhere says 301 with that
22:26  eboyjr: draginx: I recommend not calculating the length in PHP, just javascript
22:27  draginx: hmm so then I'd have to do a calculate onload meh
22:27  draginx: but then i need to process the data in PHP after I post
22:27  eboyjr: Just do var data = (<?php echo json_encode($sql->data[1]); ?>);
22:28  eboyjr: Will be much simpler
22:28  draginx: which would give me innacurate results *sighs* why cant they just play nicely? is that *really* to hard to ask
22:28  eboyjr: You already have $() in jquery for that
22:28  draginx: hmm
22:28  draginx: i dont see how this fixes my problem but ill give it a shot
22:28  kicken: draginx, if I copy/paste that into both JS and PHP I get 301 from both
22:29  draginx: kicken: theres two newlines in there… ugh
22:29  eboyjr: so 303
22:29  eboyjr: weird
22:29  eboyjr: This is a PHP issue
22:29  Dantman: draginx, do you think you have any multibyte characters in there?
22:29  draginx:   var data = ("Never really had a problem with this before but ... \r\n\r\nYour message may only be up to 4,000 characters long.\r\n\r\nWould be good to have a character counter next to the \"Post New Thread\" button just so we can know we aren't going over the max characters. Spent ages cutting down my post and ended up giving up.");
22:29  draginx: just newlines
22:29  draginx: I got #php telling me its a #js issue and #js telling me its a #php issue lol
22:30  eboyjr: Ohhh \r is your problem
22:30  eboyjr: Its a js issue
22:30  Dantman: It's probably more of a difference in correct functionality issue... or whitespace not being transfered
22:30  draginx: :P ok when I encode it in JSON it works fine
22:30  eboyjr: More specifically a browser issue
22:30  draginx: Dantman: it's trimmed
22:30  eboyjr: I bet it would work in Opera
22:31  draginx: eboyjr: it works with the JSON data
22:31  Dantman: draginx, I meant by the \r\n
22:31  eboyjr: Yes because json properly encodes \r\n
22:31  eboyjr: Always use json_encode
22:32  Dantman: You may want to be wary about multibyte characters too
22:32  draginx: eboyjr: ok so…. when I'm doing the keyup() function what should I use?
22:32  draginx: and does ]r]n count is 4 chars or just 1?
22:32  eboyjr: Almost better to just use javascript and never use things like <input value="<?php echo htmlentities($d, ENT_QUOTES, "utf-8"); ?>" />
22:32  eboyjr: \r\n is 2
22:32  draginx: hmmm for both php and js?
22:32  eboyjr: Yes
22:34  draginx: eboyjr: new problem http://pastie.org/private/x3pi1jdf3ohbdc6slqo3q both initially get the correct data
22:34  draginx: but then when I do the .leyup() it does the math wrong O_o
22:35  draginx: it gets "308" and when I do keyup it gets "305"
22:35  eboyjr: $("#message").keyup(function() { $("#chars_left").text(format(6000-$(this).val().length)) });
22:35  draginx: im assuming it has to do with the \r\n issue again would I have to parse the .val() into json again?
22:35  eboyjr: Don't regex out the value of #chars_left
22:35  draginx: im not
22:35  draginx: its a new pastie
22:36  daedhel: i'm having a problem with a particular script, autoheght.js . My problem must be fairly simple. I tansfered a site from a server to another, and the script stopped working. here is the adress:
22:36  daedhel: http://cdcsherbrooke.org/blogue.html
22:36  daedhel: the script uses jquery
22:36  Pilate: thats because the addresses in the source are relative, not absolute
22:36  daedhel: http://www.lost-in-code.com/programming/jquery-auto-iframe-height/
22:37  daedhel: Pilate, I "sed"ed all the sources to the new adress
22:37  Pilate: well wheres the new address
22:38  eboyjr: draginx: http://pastie.org/private/qxtbqy7yrh60yjgoaxmpfa
22:38  eboyjr: .keyup() is the way to trigger keyup() right?
22:38  daedhel: Pilate, if you look at the source and try to load the scripts adresses, you will see that the new adresses work
22:39  draginx: eboyjr: wow that worked O_o ok thanks :)
22:39  draginx: yup
22:39  eboyjr: Great :)
22:39  draginx: u got a PP addy? buy you  abeer
22:39  eboyjr: no need, it was too small of help
22:39  draginx: thanks :) appreciate it
22:39  eboyjr: mhm.

22:51  apeiros: sorry to ask again, but I didn't get an answer 2h ago...
22:51  apeiros: what's the canonical way to check whether an object is an Array? `obj instanceof Array`, `obj.constructor == Array` or even something else?
22:52  eboyjr: v8> typeof []
22:52  v8bot: eboyjr: "object"
22:52  eboyjr: not that ;)
22:53  apeiros: yeees, with typeof you'd even confuse it with null :-p
22:53  eboyjr: isntanceof is probably the way to go.
22:53  apeiros: js> typeof(null)
22:53  gbot2: apeiros: "object"
22:53  kicken: I use instanceof
22:53  eboyjr: typeof null
22:53  eboyjr: Why would you need to check if an object is an array?
22:53  Alex3000: instanceof return Array?
22:53  apeiros: eboyjr, because the behaviour is entirely different eboyjr
22:54  Guest8698: is there a problem with ie and .onload ?
22:54  apeiros: with a non-null, non-array object I iterate using for(property in object) and test for own property
22:54  eboyjr: arrays don't do* anything, apeiros
22:54  apeiros: eboyjr, why do you ask if you don't want to listen (read) the whole answer? :)
22:55  apeiros: anyway, rest of the answer: with arrays, I use length and iterate with for(i=0; i<len; i++), no further checks.
22:56  apeiros: it's for the implementation of a hashmap that accepts arbitrary objects as key, not just strings.
22:56  eboyjr: Ah I just think you should haven to check... you should know ahead-of-time whether something is an array or object, but that's just me
22:56  Alex3000: [] instanceof Array == true
22:57  apeiros: eboyjr, for the common case I concur. one should normalize the input.
22:57  eboyjr: v8> var a = []; a.foo = 'bar'; a.push(3); a.push(4); a;
22:57  v8bot: eboyjr: [3, 4]
22:57  eboyjr: v8> var a = []; a.foo = 'bar'; a.push(3); a.push(4); a.foo
22:57  v8bot: eboyjr: "bar"
22:58  apeiros: hrm, good point.

22:58  Alex3000:  	
22:58  Alex3000: 0

23:30  daedhel: kicken, do you have an intuition on what it would mean?
23:30  kicken: the permission denied error?
23:30  daedhel: yes
23:32  daedhel: kicken, it works if you use www.cdcsherbrooke.org but not if you use cdcsherbrooke.org
