15:21  aklt: Hi, anyone familiar with the vows framework?  I get "Cannot call method match of undefined" when an assertion fails.
15:25  joeytwiddle: yes frio80, what you said about setTimeout sounds right.  the browser *must* wait for running JS to finish, because JS is single-threaded
15:31 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
15:37  frio80: joeytwiddle: Right, so if I use setTimeout and load a.js, b.js and c.js, it will wait until it runs an script entire script before settimeout executes.  (Assuming the delay is small enough to pre-empty code in a, b and c)
15:38  joeytwiddle: yep
15:38  frio80: joeytwiddle: thanks

16:18  SomeRandom: Hello, I am having trouble in IE killing a Flash SWF movie, that is being loaded into a Modal Window. I don't think the problem lies in the Modal Window. But basically I have a close button which I have tried to send a call back on closing
16:19  SomeRandom: to kill the Flash, via the swfobject remove function, but its just not working.
16:19  SomeRandom: The sounds keeps playing in the background after I kill the flash movie.
16:20  SomeRandom: Anyone have any suggestions on how to complete kill the flash movie?
16:20  SomeRandom: It's working fine in FF, Chrome etc... just not in IE.

16:25  developerhealey: strstr = strstr.replace(/[A-Z]/g," $0")        I am trying to replace the Capitalize letter with a space and a capitalized letter found... but does $0 suppose to bring the result into the replace?
16:26  ace_me: how to remove the attribute style for a element ?
16:26  ace_me: entirely
16:28  wyled: ace_me, removeAttribute
16:28  developerhealey: i know jquery does it with .removeAttr
16:28  wyled: elm = document.getElementById('elmId'); elm.removeAttribute('style');
16:30  g105b: wyled: what browser support does removeAttribute have?
16:30  wyled: it is in DOM1 spec
16:31  ace_me: it work thx
16:31  wyled: there is also removeAttributeNS
16:31  wyled: http://reference.sitepoint.com/javascript/Element/removeAttributeNS
16:33  wyled: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-6D6AC0F9
16:33  DonkeyCongo: I want my script to remember whether a block was expanded/collapsed between visits. Will I have to use cookies for this?
16:34  g105b: Why would you use jQuery's .removeAttr over native JavaScript's .removeAttribute?
16:34  systemfault: Because why would he mix regular DOM calls with jQuery?
16:34  systemfault: Consistency isn't a bad thing, afaik
16:35  wyled: this isn't a jquery channel
16:35  tbranyen: jquery isn't javascript duh
16:35  systemfault: This isn't a DOM channel either afaik
16:35  tbranyen: its java
16:35  tbranyen: go to #java
16:35  systemfault: Is it a DOM channel?
16:36  wyled: it is related to the DOM obviously
16:36  systemfault: wyled: JQuery is related to javascript.
16:36  systemfault: So are the thousands of other libraries.
16:36  wyled: the question wasn't about jquery, wtf are you arguing with me for?
16:36  wyled: jesus
16:37  tbranyen: wow what a bitch
16:37  tbranyen: can't handle words
16:37  systemfault: Because it's my right as a member of the Freenode community to give my opinion.
16:37  pigdude: systemfault: yea but DOM is generally considered on topic
16:38  systemfault: pigdude: I know, just playing with words since it's what he was doing :)
16:38  pigdude: ah
16:38 * pigdude frowns at jQuery
16:38  systemfault: pigdude: It's a bit like Boost questions are accepted in ##C++
16:38  systemfault: (If you know about that)
16:38  pigdude: eh i just do C
16:39  systemfault: <3
16:39  pigdude: but yea i won't field jQ questions
16:40  g105b: Hi I fell over the other day and grazed my knee, can I fix it with jQuery?
16:40  DonkeyCongo: I want my script to remember whether a block was expanded/collapsed on last visit. Will I have to use cookies for this?
16:40  systemfault: DonkeyCongo: That the easiest way to do it imho
16:40  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: yes, or "HTML5" persistence like localstorage
16:40  g105b: DonkeyCongo: That would probably be the best option.
16:41  DonkeyCongo: Wont the cookie get sent to the server with every HTTP request?
16:42 --- names is now known as drey
16:42  g105b: DonkeyCongo: yes it will.
16:43  g105b: DonkeyCongo: but I assume that you will only be storing 1 byte of information, so is that a problem?
16:43  pigdude: you can also use hash value
16:43  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: ^
16:43  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: you can store state in hash
16:43  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: this can be nice because they can send a link that has the same ui state
16:44  g105b: pigdude: DonkeyCongo: hash value is much better than storing cookies for state changes, good call.
16:44  pigdude: g105b: im still waking up :^)
16:44  DonkeyCongo: Hash value?
16:44  DonkeyCongo: In the url?
16:44  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: url#something:other
16:44  g105b: DonkeyCongo: window.location.hash = "open";
16:44  DonkeyCongo: That wont work between session, though?
16:45  DonkeyCongo: sessions*
16:45  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: oh, you want this to span pages
16:45  DonkeyCongo: ye =/
16:45  g105b: DonkeyCongo: if you went back to the same url, it would.
16:45  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: in that case passing hash value might seem cumbersome, it is your call
16:45  pigdude: DonkeyCongo: in that case i'd use cookie
16:45  DonkeyCongo: I'll probably be forced, Im just not happy about it =/
16:45  g105b: DonkeyCongo: using location.hash means your browser's back button would still work (click back to undo the change, etc.)
16:46  DonkeyCongo: ye, I use it already. But it wont work here =/
16:46  pigdude: assuming the ui change is that sort of event
16:46  pigdude: that you step through
16:46  pigdude: otherwise history isn't a big benefit
16:46  pigdude: it sounds more like a preference
16:48  g105b: DonkeyCongo: if you are having lots of settings to save across sessions, use a session cookie. An integer ID that identifies the user to the server, and all the actual settings are then stored on the server.
16:48  DonkeyCongo: Just taking a look at localstorage. Seems like it's supported in most browsers.
16:48  Plazma: so.. as far as free documentation and 'places to get started' go.. i keep hearing mixed reactions about w3schools
16:48  DonkeyCongo: g105b: It's just this one
16:49  g105b: DonkeyCongo: then I think simple cookie manipulation is fine
16:49  g105b: and the best option in your situation
16:50  DonkeyCongo: g105b: You dont like localStorage?
16:50  g105b: DonkeyCongo: I love it, but it is only supported in HTML5 compliant browsers
16:51  DonkeyCongo: Isnt that most browser?
