00:00  GoSox: oh it is inclusive because i'm matching the opposite
00:00  GoSox: i think i'm good
00:00  ironmagma: GoSox: test it with stuff beginning with zero
00:00  GoSox: still fails
00:01  GoSox: meaning, it passes appropriately
00:02  GoSox: i can't find anything to break this zip code check
00:11  GoSox: i think the javascript to check this form is bigger than the form itself
00:14  GoSox: are newlines ok to use in the middle of if statements
00:18  jamesdotnet:  /\d{1,5}/
00:19  paxcoder: hello. i just came here again to say I HATE JAVASCRIPT
00:19  GoSox: paxcoder: i do too
00:19  GoSox: but there is nothing else that does what it does
00:19  GoSox: so i suffer and use it
00:19  paxcoder: I hate it more than CSS. In CSS you can say: there's no this while it should be, this works some other way.
00:20  paxcoder: But in JS, I do everything right, and then it just WONT WORK
00:20  GoSox: that's a tough one, deciding which i hate more, JS or CSS
00:20  GoSox: i'm tempted to say i hate CSS more but its close
00:20  paxcoder: JS is the most indeterministic (so to say) language i have ever used and i used about a dozen.
00:21  GoSox: but i'm a fan of multi-columned, variable-width layouts soooo CSS and myself do not get along
00:21  GoSox: you know i was thinking
00:21  paxcoder: Gokee2, i do. i myself grew up on tables.
00:21  paxcoder: but this is a JS rant.
00:21  GoSox: theres no reason why a web browser couldn't have a very verbose javascript mode
00:21  jamesdotnet: CSS doesn't prevent you from using tables. That's just a religious thing.
00:21  GoSox: something that gave errors as detailed as php errors
00:22  paxcoder: jamesdotnet, i think it's got something with search engine indexing. so i heared...
00:22  jamesdotnet: bah, search engines can figure out where your menus are
00:22  paxcoder: GoSox, it's not that. it simply won't do what it's told
00:22  GoSox: jamesdotnet: i know. on my current project, i gave up on my efforts to stop using tables, and started using them all over again. i realized that what i was trying to do was recreate every single behavoir of table, with css and divs. and this was stupid
00:22  Gregor: *hyuk*
00:23  GoSox: started using them all over, again
00:23 * Gregor can't decide if he just relishes in other peoples' pain, or it's failure at JS in particular that entertains him so.
00:25  paxcoder: Just for the record (the log), I'm talking about offsetTop property, and also another thing that might not strictly be JS' fault.
00:26  paxcoder: Gregor, if you want i'll show you. I bet you'll be just as stumped as i am.
00:26  jamesdotnet: That one is DOM's fail :)
00:26  paxcoder: jamesdotnet, the first or do you guess for the second one?
00:26  Gregor: paxcoder: Fine, pastebin some code
00:26  paxcoder: jamesdotnet, it's hard to draw the line
00:27  jamesdotnet: Well pretty much anything you do with document elements is DOM
00:27  paxcoder: Gregor, i have it all inline in one file (and no that does not determine my value as a JS programmer), so i can upload that, and let you download it. no server-side. it's a proof of concept (some proof...).
00:28  Gregor: OK, I am not preventing you from doing that :P
00:28  paxcoder: jamesdotnet, all JS does is that. I don't expect its math functions to fail.
00:28  Gregor: js> 0.1 + 0.2
00:28  gbot2: Gregor: 0.30000000000000004
00:28  paxcoder: XD
00:29  jamesdotnet: That's IEEE754's fault :)
00:29  Gregor: jamesdotnet: Yeah, but it was a wonderful context ;)
00:29  paxcoder: Gregor, I doubt that you'd have the patience, but here's the thing: http://arka.foi.hr/~lmarcetic/zoomable_sets.html
00:30  FIQ: js> false
00:30  gbot2: FIQ: false
00:30  FIQ: `js false
00:30  FIQ: ok
00:30  paxcoder: Gregor, as you might've noticed, dragging functionality fails.
00:31  paxcoder: It's unpredictable
00:31  paxcoder: i have some theories, but the fail is consistent across browsers (well, two kits: webkit and netscape's), so i'm naturally on the edge.
00:32  GoSox: heres one thing I like about javascript. You don't have to worry about your code being the most optimized code possible. Half a second won't make a difference on the user's browser. But add half a second to php execution and it will add up on the server very quickly
00:33  Gregor: paxcoder: It appears to drag the workspace around, and also zoom/scale it such that the right and bottom doesn't change. What is it supposed to do?
00:33  Pilum: Thinking like that will get you into trouble soon enough.
00:33  Gregor: paxcoder: Oh, I see
00:33  paxcoder: you can ignore zooming. that's understandable. what's with the dragging darnit?
00:33  Pilum: There's plenty of browser operations which will make the browser sluggish as hell if you don't optimize.
00:34  paxcoder: Gregor, it used to be workspace size was 100% and no border. however this fails too
00:35  paxcoder: Pilum, are you talking to me?
00:35  Pilum: No, to Gregor.
00:36  Gregor: Pilum: Uhhh ... why were you saying that to me then?
00:36  paxcoder: Pilate, you mean GoSox
00:36  Pilum: Apologies, GoSox, yes.
00:36  paxcoder: who's gone btw, so that's why you called otu Gregor. To the code fellows please.
00:36  Gregor: Pilum: I wrote a friggin' MIPS simulator in JavaScript, I know all about not writing sluggish JS code :P
00:37  paxcoder: if you want a walkthrough, i'm perfectly willing to go into any detail
00:37  paxcoder: because i've lost all hope on fixing it myself
00:37  paxcoder: there might be some obscure DOM knowledge that i'm unaware of in your heads, and that is my last hope.
00:40  Gregor: paxcoder: Your problem is that parseInt parses integers of any of various types, and you're specifically giving it octal ints by prepending a 0.
00:40  paxcoder: O.O
00:40  paxcoder: no friggin kidding, really?
00:40  Gregor: paxcoder: You need to do your type-conversion more reliably and earlier, you're storing ints and then recasting them to ints defensively, instead you should be assuring that you've always converted them in the first place.
00:40  paxcoder: stupid dynamic typing
00:40  paxcoder: ;-)
00:41  Gregor: Now you may bask in my almost unending brilliance :P
00:41  paxcoder: haha XD
00:41  paxcoder: wait, i'll test it out, tell you how it went
00:41  paxcoder: what does your brilliance suggest where i should convert it?
00:42  Gregor: The quickest thing to test would be to use the second argument to parseInt (the radix) and give it the value 10; that's just to verify what I'm saying though.
00:42  paxcoder: line 63 at the call perhaps?
00:42  Gregor: You should do the parseInt part (with pre/a-ppending 0 and radix=10) when you first set workspaceXY in mousedown
00:42  Gregor: paxcoder: As per mouseXY, as far as I can tell it never holds anything but an integer anyway, so there's no need to ever do conversions over it.
00:43  paxcoder: you mean without preppending?
00:44  Gregor: You will need to do something there, as the first time 'round the string will be empty. You could:
00:44  Gregor:  * Use getComputedStyle to assure you always have a value.
00:44  Gregor:  * Prepend something to assure that an empty string won't cause problems, or
00:44  Gregor:  * Use the ever-popular recursive offsetParent function.
00:45  Gregor: I would go for the second in this case, for simplicity.
00:45  Gregor: Just that if you do prepend a 0, you have to use the parseInt radix option to make sure it doesn't cause troubles.
00:45  paxcoder: there's a getComputedStyle? won't that return px's?
00:45  Gregor: paxcoder: Yes ... px's is what you want, isn't it?
00:46  Gregor: In this case it's probably overcomplicated since you're really not doing anything very complicated with the parent styles *shrugs*
00:46  paxcoder: yes. but i asked for that yesterday.
00:46  Gregor: `ref mdc getcomputedstyle @ paxcoder
00:46  v8bot: paxcoder: window.getComputedStyle - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.getComputedStyle
00:47  paxcoder: Gregor, you are the man, man.
00:47  Gregor: Note that .left will not /always/ be in px with getComputedStyle, since all that really does is walk up through parent stylesheets, so it could be %, px, anything.
00:47  paxcoder: it works now.
00:47  paxcoder: also i'm completely impressed by the speed at which you were able to comprehend my code. Is JS all you ever do?XD
00:48  paxcoder: Gregor, oh. then that's not what i asked for yesterday. That thing can't be done I guess.
00:48  paxcoder: in any case, thanks for this.
00:48  Gregor: paxcoder: I'm a PhD researcher currently focusing on trying to decipher why particular patterns of hideous things are done in JS eval strings, so deciphering JS code is, in fact, pretty much what I do :P
00:49  Gregor: paxcoder: If you want the left and top as px in all cases, then you want the infamous recursive offsetParent function ... can probably find some version of it by googling for "javascript offsetleft offsettop offsetparent"
00:49  paxcoder: cool. that's one research i fully support ;-)
00:51  paxcoder: Gregor, i don't think that would guarantee px's
00:51  paxcoder: (different formulas for different browsers, given different default font sizes etc9
00:51  peeps[work]: is encodeURI supported by crappy browsers (ie IE)?
00:51  Gregor: paxcoder: offsetLeft is always in terms of px relative to the offsetParent.
00:51  paxcoder: Gregor, were you here yesterday when i was lamenting about not being able to get a correct offsetTop?
00:52  Gregor: paxcoder: Apparently not? :P
00:52  Gregor: paxcoder: I'm always logged in, that rarely means I'm paying attention.
00:52  paxcoder: *recursivelly. i needed absolute position of a li
00:52  paxcoder: now i'm thinking it could be that for some strange reason i've got stuff in things other than pixels.
00:53  paxcoder: real possibility. my li's were em sized.
00:53  Gregor: paxcoder: li's are sometimes ... weird in where browsers consider them to be, but you should still be able to get something in pixels, it just may not be super-obvious where it considers the top-left of the li to be.
00:54  paxcoder: will try that again some times.
00:55 --- em is now known as emma
00:57  paxcoder: Gregor: seems i'll have to see if tops and lefts i get are defined. because obviously appending a 0 won't work when they're negative...
00:57  paxcoder: *i'll compare them to ''
00:57  Gregor: paxcoder: Heh, good point X-D. Probably clearer anyway.
00:57  Gregor: peeps[work]: IIRC (was trying to verify, but can't), encodeURI actually started in IE.
00:57  Gregor: peeps[work]: Even if not, it's certainly been around since the IE5 era.
00:58 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
00:58  paxcoder: yeah, all better now

01:02  peeps[work]: Gregor, ah, good. thanks

01:05  jsilver: how do i pop a lightbox of an HTML page in jquery ... all lightbox libraries seem to want to show movies or images
01:11  llrcombs: you'd really need something like Google's preview imager for that
01:12 --- emma is now known as em
01:16 --- paxcoder is now known as px
01:16  px: em, ;-)
01:17 --- px is now known as paxcoder
01:21  peeps[work]: has anyone added a google map to a site before?  i'm having an issue where it appears to be inheriting the css, and covering the map with my background color or something
01:25  llrcombs: I sure have
01:25  llrcombs: and I've always wished there was some CSS property to force nothing to inherit
01:30  peeps[work]: llrcombs, what did you end up doing?
01:31  llrcombs: well, the issue I'm (still) having is in a Safari extension
01:31 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
01:31  llrcombs: so whenever I encounter an issue due to overriding CSS stuff (either inherited or from the page's CSS), I just override it with "auto" or whatever value I'd like, then add !important
01:32  Gokee2: paxcoder, Tables are evil!

13:28  temhawk: hi. what is the difference between "function foo() { //bar }" and "foo = function() { //bar };" ?
13:29  Pilum: The first declares a function, the second assigns an anonymous function to a variable.
13:29  temhawk: but it's practically the same isn't it?
13:29  Pilum: The main implication is that the you won't be able to call the latter until after its definition.
13:30  temhawk: as in "new foo();" right?
13:30  Pilum: No.
13:31  temhawk: but i thought i can just run "foo();" for both cases

13:43  Tasser: I've got a file with each line a json hash now just add a , at the end of each line to make an array of it?
13:45  TheSheep: what is a json hash?
13:52  Pilum: Imaginary JSON Concept of the Weekend.
13:54  Pilum: It's probably coined by someone who thinks of JSON in terms of JS objects, or who think that JS object === JSON, and who's observed that JS objects are some sort of hash.
13:55  TheSheep: like in a hash table?
13:55 * Pilum nods.
13:55  TheSheep: isn't the hash just a number usually?
13:56  Pilum: Hash in this context being more or less synonymous to dictionary or associative array. It's how they're generally implemented in the engine.
13:56  Pilum: Tasser: JSON is strings.
13:57  TheSheep: also, I'd think it's dependent on the size of memory allocated for the object, and maybe some platform details, so I see no sense it saving it
13:57  Pilum: Plain text if you will.

14:34  _Absolut: Before calling, I certified that $tmpCP is correct, echoing it. In JS, I have the function ->   function CLVerifyZipCode(PL) { alert(PL); }

14:36  RusAlex: how can i do that ?
14:36  RusAlex: im new in javascript =)
14:38  RusAlex: can anyone help me ?
14:39  temhawk: _Absolut: what is the value of $tmpCP?

14:41  RusAlex: temhawk
14:41  RusAlex: thanks
14:41  temhawk: np
14:42  temhawk: _Absolut: what is the string?
14:43  temhawk: _Absolut: nevermind. you need quotation marks around the string when you call the function.
14:43  _Absolut:  temhawk: Is
14:43  _Absolut: 01,ALAVA,945,#02,ALBACETE,967,#03,ALICANTE,96,#04,ALMERIA,950,#05,AVILA,920,#06,BADAJOZ,924,##
14:43  temhawk: instead of CLVerifyZipCode(<? echo $tmpCP; ?>) do CLVerifyZipCode("<? echo $tmpCP; ?>")
14:44  _Absolut: temhawk: quotation marks like ????????
14:44  _Absolut: Ah
14:44  _Absolut: Thank's
14:44  Pilum: I fail to see the point of using document.getElementById when document.forms is so much shorter, and equally or more efficient (depending on implementation).
14:44  temhawk: otherwise the browser thinks it's a variable, and one which doesn't exist of course
14:44  temhawk: np

19:02  peeps[lappy]: or, for percentage 100 / 75
19:02  peeps[lappy]: * 100
19:03  peeps[lappy]: it's just the inverse
19:03  trave: ah, thanks

19:06  cscott: have never used pastebin before, can you find post by name (cscott)?
19:06  keith27: hm so how would you test if a string contains @
19:06  cscott: I don't see an obvious way to grab a URL to the post
19:07  peeps[lappy]: no, when you post, it should give you a link, you paste that in here

19:08  peeps[lappy]: keith27, @ is not a special character in a regex, so just put it in there

19:11  keith27: sorry i am not totally getting this yet :/ what about for @ and .
19:11  peeps[lappy]: . is a special character
19:11  keith27: oh i see
19:12  peeps[lappy]: but not when used in brackets
19:12  keith27: js> /^[@.]+$/.test('foo@barcom')

19:17  keith27: peeps[lappy]: how do you test if it contains those characters but not only those characters?
19:17  cscott: peeps[lappy],  thanks.. I'd pretty much figured that out now. :-)  Does that cast the value as a string (x)?  What's  the best way to extract the value?
19:19  peeps[lappy]: cscott, only use for...in to loop over an object's properties, not arrays.  just do a regular for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { array[i]... }

19:35  vettels: can anyone help me please?
19:36  EvanR: is there such a thing as a proper email validator
19:36  quest88: is there a way to get the key,value when cycling through an array?
19:36  EvanR: theres local policy which shouldnt be hard, but to validate whether an address goes somewhere the only way is to send one
19:36  quest88: similar to php's foreach($list as $key => $value)?
19:37  vettels: could someone look at this please: http://pastie.org/1349890
19:37  EvanR: quest88: arrays dont have key values, its nominally numeric indexes
19:37  EvanR: you probably mean iterate through object properties for some reason
19:37  EvanR: for that, use a for..in loop
19:37  quest88: EvanR, you can use: array['key'] = value; though, right?
19:38  EvanR: for(k in obj){ ...obj[k]... }
19:38  carlocci: php--
19:38  jsBot: carlocci took a beer from php. php now owes 12 beers.
19:38  EvanR: quest88: not array. object
19:38  peeps[lappy]: EvanR, well, proper in that it at least checks for a valid top level domain, checks for bad characters, etc.
19:38  EvanR: peeps[lappy]: no real point in checking for 'bad' characters, no one cares about the standards anyway
19:39  EvanR: it just depends on the purpose, to satisfy a local policy, or to check whether its a 'real' email attached to an account
19:39  EvanR: both have no much to do with standards
19:39  peeps[lappy]: vettels, you have to ask a question, for us to help you
19:40  vettels: ok, thank you...here goes...
19:40  vettels: i have this script: http://pastie.org/1349890
19:40  vettels: which works fine
19:40  vettels: but i want to be able to add more spans
19:40  vettels: does that make sense?
19:41  Ond: Why would you get the innerHTML twice?
19:42  vettels: well that's kind of what i want to do do i guess...
19:42  vettels: so be able to have multiple <span id="output">, with different number in
19:42  Ond: The condition of the if statement will always be true then
19:42  Ond: Ah, ok
19:43  Ond: But you can't have multiple IDs can you
19:43  Ond: You'll need a class
19:43  vettels: my js isn't quite up to doing that yet, but i figured it's probably fairly simple for someone who know's what they're doing....
19:43  vettels: how do you mean?
19:44  Ond: I always took "id" to mean that it is unique to each element.
19:44  vettels: so you can't have two of the same id?
19:44  peeps[lappy]: correct
19:44  peeps[lappy]: it's invalid html
19:44  vettels: ok, so how else could i do this?
19:45  vettels: without writing a separate function for each id?
19:45  Ond: You assign them all the same class.
19:46  Ond: And loop through the array that document.getElementsByClassName(classname); returns
19:46  Ond: But, your if/else statement is nonsensical.
19:46  vettels: okay, i'll have a go at that then
19:46  Ond: So you should just multiply the innerHTML of each element by five, without the if/else.
19:47  Ond: Will you be comparing two unique elements?
19:47  Ond: Their innerHTML, I mean.
19:47  vettels: no
19:47  vettels: they're totally separate
19:47  Ond: ...
19:47  Ond: Then you WILL be comparing two unique elements.
19:47  Ond: Make unique ID's for them.
19:48  Ond: Then your if/else might make sense.
19:48  vettels: i'll go and have a go at that then, and come back if i come across problems :)
19:49  vettels: thanks for your help
19:49  Ond: No problem

19:50  peeps[lappy]: that's why i let jquery handle all my cross browser bullshit
19:50  quest88: EvanR, If array['key'] = value is really an object, and not an array, is hash = { name: 'quest88', id: '01' }; also an object?
19:51  EvanR: quest88: there are two data structures in js, not one like in php
19:51  quest88: right
19:51  EvanR: neither of them are like the one in php
19:51  quest88: but they both represent objects?
19:51  quest88: ..both data structures I mentioned*
19:51  EvanR: for sane practical purposes just think of one as arrays (sequence of elements) and one as objects (set of named properties)
19:52  EvanR: dont lose your mind in a psychadelic journey to find out what arrays 'really are'
19:52  quest88: lol
19:52  quest88: sounds good to me then
19:52  quest88: thanks
19:55  EvanR: [1,2,3] vs {a: 1, b:2, c:3}
19:55  EvanR: getElementByClassName interesting, well, guess you gotta write it yourself or use a library like jquery
19:57  Pilum: Or simply target modern browsers heh.
19:59  EvanR: which browsers support it?
20:00  fatbrain: all "important" ones? :D
20:01  Pilum: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html#t11
20:04  EvanR: is it html5?
20:04  Pilum: Yes.

20:17  peeps[lappy]: i'm trying to add a google map with the maps js api to an iframe, and control it from the top frame.  but i'm just getting js errors from the google scripts.  anyone know if this is possible, or have an example for this?
20:17  TheSheep: peeps[lappy]: are they in the same domain?
20:18  peeps[lappy]: yes
20:18  peeps[lappy]: i'm using this include for the api: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
20:19  peeps[lappy]: i had it working, without the iframe, but the css styles from my page were being inherited on the map and making it render all wrong
20:20  peeps[lappy]: that's why i'm trying the iframe, unless there is a better way.  i really don't want to edit the css though, since i didn't write it to begin with, and it affects all the pages on the site
20:21  peeps[lappy]: in the top frame, i try to instantiate:  var map = new google.maps.Map(map_frame.document.getElementById("map_canvas"), options);
20:22  Pilum: The better way is to stop being a lazy bum and adjust the CSS as required, for the map's elements.
20:22  vettels: how do i get the values out of document.getElementsByName()?
20:22  vettels: instead of just [object HTMLSpanElement]?
20:22  Pilum: vettels: What values?
20:22  Pilum: Spans don't have values.
20:22  vettels: the values that i put in the spans
20:23  vettels: <span name="output">100</span>
20:23  vettels: i want to get 100 out
20:23  Pilum: innerText | textContent then.
20:23  vettels: sorry, could you give me an example of that please- never come across that before
20:24  peeps[lappy]: Pilum, there is a rule like #pageContainer div { ... } in the css.  so any div descendants in the page get this applied.  i don't know how to change that without breaking the style acrosss the site
20:24  vettels: something like: document.getElementsByName(name).innerText ?
20:24  keith27: peeps[lappy]: could you just append all the css to be #site_container #whatever (instead of just #whatever), and have the map_canvas outside of the site container?
20:24  Pilum: peeps[lappy]: You don't change that. You write additional styles to overrule that for the elements in question.
20:25  Pilum: vettels: getElementsByName returns a node list, so no.
20:26  Pilum: vettels: objRef.textContent for most browsers and objRef.innerText for IE.
20:26  vettels: ah ok, i got it
20:26  vettels: thanks :)

21:07  Gorkyman: explain whats wrong with nice snow effect? if I found one that is minimalistic and take zero cpu
21:07  yorick: kkombarji: redirecting the xmlhttprequest will not redirect your page
21:07  yorick: Gorkyman: nothing
21:08  kkombarji: yorick: I have the redirect command in my php script
21:08  yorick: the problem is that those do not exist
21:08  yorick: kkombarji: and it will redirect your request
21:08  kkombarji: yorick: it should, but it isnt doing so
21:08  yorick: kkombarji: it probably is
21:08  yorick: kkombarji: redirecting request != changing page url
21:09  kkombarji: yorick: basically all i want js to do is process the user input. If the input is valid then it passes it onto php so php can do the redirect. If the input isn't valid, it outputs an error to screen.
21:09  yorick: kkombarji: why do you want the php then
21:10  kkombarji: yorick: because I'm familiar with php and not too familiar with js :p
21:10  yorick: kkombarji: using window.location will work
21:10  yorick: kkombarji: using form POST will also work
21:11  yorick: you can't change page url using only xmlhttprequest
21:11  kkombarji: yorick: thanks it worked

23:11  wkmanire: Do you know if jquery even handles document ready inside of iframes?

23:13  wkmanire: Well, I've done that already sort of.
23:13  wkmanire: I have the server put some script in the response that attempts to call a function in the host document.
23:14  wkmanire: But the problem is, that the iframe is getting its own scope.
23:14  wkmanire: So it can't see the javascripts that already exist in the host document.
23:14  wkmanire: So using a jquery event wrapper isn't really going to help in this case I think.
23:14  ironmagma: why can't the server just put the code there?
23:14  wkmanire: Thats what its attempting to do already. But like I said, its not in the same scope so it can't see the javascript in the host document.
23:15  wkmanire: This seems like it would be a common problem, I'm sure there is a "standard" solution somewhere.
23:15  ironmagma: so the server responds with a page, and the page includes an onload attribute?

23:15  ironmagma: in the page's body tag?
23:17  wkmanire: ironmagma: http://pastebin.com/TiJjQnSG
23:17  wkmanire: The code is in vb.net but you should be able to see what the response will look like.
23:17  wkmanire: It tries to call rfs2.admin.UploadFrame.framePosted and pass it a result.
23:18  clint326: can anyone help a js newbie with a question?
23:18  ironmagma: clint326: probably.
23:18  clint326: i'm trying to fill an html5 canvas with random dots, wait a second, clear it, and repeat
23:18  ironmagma: wkmanire: and that only gets run once?
23:19  clint326: i can fill the canvas and clear it
23:19  wkmanire: ironmagma: correct.
23:19  clint326: but my one second delay keeps failing
23:19  clint326: is there any good way to delay or wait one second (does not need to be exact)
23:19  wkmanire: clint326: there are two ways to time events, you can use a timeout or an interval.
23:20  wkmanire: clint326: the w3schools website has good documentation on the functions for that.
23:20  Pilum: `w3schools
23:20  jsBot: w3schools: Errors, omissions, deceit.  They are NOT (despite their name) related to the W3C. Their code contains deprecated code, bad methodologies, IE-centric code and mistakes. Stop reading/pointing to them!
23:20  clint326: i was using var t = setTimeOut({}, 1000);
23:21  clint326: which didn't seem to work
23:21  wkmanire: {} is undefined.
23:21  clint326: ah, ha
23:21  ironmagma: clint: it's setTimeout, which will fire once.
23:21  Pilum: setTimeout takes a function. And {} is not undefined, it's an empty object literal.
23:21  wkmanire: js> {}
23:21  gbot2: wkmanire: undefined
23:21  clint326: is there a noop funciton
23:21  wkmanire: js> {};
23:21  gbot2: wkmanire: undefined
23:22  ironmagma: js> {,};
23:22  gbot2: ironmagma: Error: SyntaxError: syntax error:  {,};  .^
23:22  ironmagma: js> new Object();
23:22  gbot2: ironmagma: {}
23:22 * wkmanire went through this a week ago or so.
23:22  Pilum: What I meant is, it's only declared, it's not got anything yet.
23:22  wkmanire: Without at least one label a javascript parser can't know if {} is a block, or an object literal.
23:22  ironmagma: wkmanire: well, that's not really an onload function. you're saying that code embedded in the iframe only gets run once?
23:23  Pilum: In any case, it's not what setTimeout expects.
23:23  wkmanire: irognmagma: its going to get run after each successful post.
23:23  peeps[lappy]: anyone recommend a place to get some loading spinner gifs
23:23  clint326: irognmaga, it seems it only runs once
23:23  ironmagma: wkmanire: but it doesn't work as set up
23:23  wkmanire: ironmagma: That callback is supposed to wipe form and replace it with the basic empty form again.
23:23  wkmanire: ironmagma: But that function is not in scope inside of the iframe so it doesn't work.
23:23  Sorella: wkmanire ≣ of course the parser knows whether {} is an statement block or an object literal. It all depends on the context.
23:24  ironmagma: it might be that it doesn't know what rfs2 is the second time around?
23:24  clint326: for future reference is there a way to post code to an IRC channel -- or should I post it elsewhere and provide a link?
23:24  ironmagma: try top.rfs2
23:24  factor: Anyone work with Qooxdoo here? I am trying to get it to not overwrite my backgroud of my html or my web page, just want to inline a div.
23:24  wkmanire: Sorella: prove it :D
23:24  Pilum: js> {} instanceof Object
23:24  gbot2: Pilum: Error: SyntaxError: syntax error:  {} instanceof Object  ...^
23:24  Sorella: v8> var x = {} // you can't have statement blocks here, so it goes with object literals
23:24  v8bot: Sorella: undefined
23:24  ironmagma: js> x={}
23:24  gbot2: ironmagma: {}
23:25  ironmagma: js> var x = {}
23:25  gbot2: ironmagma: undefined
23:25  wkmanire: Sorella: ah, I stand corrected.
23:25  ironmagma: js> x = {}
23:25  gbot2: ironmagma: {}
23:25  ironmagma: ...what.
23:25  clint326: Thanks all, if I need more help I'll be back
23:25  Sorella: v8> {var x = 1;} // statement block, because object literals can't have statements
23:25  v8bot: Sorella: undefined
23:25  Pilum: js> typeof {}
23:25  gbot2: Pilum: "object"
23:25  Sorella: ironmagma ≣ var doesn't returns a value...
23:26  ironmagma: ah, didn't know that
23:26  peeps[lappy]: js> var x = {};  x;
23:26  gbot2: peeps[lappy]: {}
23:26  wkmanire: These little intricacies always get me... but I'm getting better at this. he he
23:27  Sorella: basically, statement blocks are taken as precedence when they appear at the beggining of the statement. Then it will fallback to object literals if it can't parse it. In expressions, the only thing it expects is an object literal, so...
23:27  ironmagma: wkmanire: try top.rfs2
23:27  ironmagma: or parent.rfs2
23:27  peeps[lappy]: wkmanire, the devil is in the details
23:27  wkmanire: Sorella: I see, that makes sense.
23:27  wkmanire: ironmagma: What is top?
23:28  Sorella: v8> {x: 1}; // actually a statement, because `x` is taken to be a label
23:28  v8bot: Sorella: 1
23:28  Pilum: Outermost window, in a frame context.
23:28  Pilum: A better question is, what is rfs2?
23:28  ironmagma: wkmanire: it refers to the top-level window. that is, parent.parent.parent(.parent, etc.) until you can't go any higher in the hierarchy
23:29  Sorella: v8> {x: 1, y: 2} // error, you can't have commas in your statement blocks like this
23:29  v8bot: Sorella: SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
23:29  ironmagma: wkmanire: in this case, the same as parent. semantically, just using parent is better.
23:29  wkmanire: Pilum: An object literal defined in the iframe's parent's scope.
23:29  Sorella: v8> {"x": 1} // now this is an object literal...
23:29  v8bot: Sorella: SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
23:29  Sorella: hm... or it should be?
23:29  Sorella: v8> ({x: 1})
23:29  v8bot: Sorella: {"x": 1}
23:30  Sorella: yeah, forget what I said, object literals can't be the beggining of a statement.
23:30  ironmagma: no reason for them to be anywyas
23:30  ironmagma: anyways*
23:30  wkmanire: Is parent a reserved word/member of Object or is it a member of HTMLElement or some other native type?
23:31  peeps[lappy]: parent is a property of the window object
23:31  Pilum: It doesn't belong with JS, it belongs with the DOM.
23:31  ironmagma: wkmanire: I think it's just part of the DOM, like document
23:31  darkredandyellow: omg = new String('wtf'); omg instanceof String // -> true
23:31  darkredandyellow: 'wtf' instanceof String // -> true
23:31  wkmanire: ironmagma: rfs2 isn't part of the DOM.
23:31  darkredandyellow: why?
23:31  peeps[lappy]: `js ref window.parent
23:31  Pilum: `dom ref parent
23:31  jsBot: dom ref parent: Returns a reference to the parent of the current window or subframe. (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.parent)
23:31  darkredandyellow: uhm, sorry, omg = new String('wtf'); omg instanceof String // -> false
23:31  ironmagma: wkmanire: but it's part of your main document (containing the iframe), no?
23:32  wkmanire: irognmagma: Its a "namespace" not part of any DOM.
23:32  ironmagma: wkmanire: I'm aware.
23:32  Pilum: wkmanire: Objects can be referenced heh.
23:33  wkmanire: I'm going to give it a try, just a sec. If that works then I have  me some re-learning to do.
23:33  ironmagma: wkmanire: if you've got some code declaring variable x = 3, in an iframe, you can access that via window.frames[0].x
23:33  Pilum: Any object is a property of the "root" window object.
23:33  Pilum: Or a descendant thereof.
23:33  ironmagma: wkmanire: similarly, you can access parent.x from the iframe, to access variable x defined in the parent.
23:33  Sorella: v8> [new String("foo") instanceof String, "foo" instanceof String] // true, false, y'mean? darkredandyellow
23:33  v8bot: Sorella: [true, false]
23:33  Pilum: And via the window object reference, you can reference any native or custom object of said window (provided you've got access).
23:34  ironmagma: v8> window
23:34  v8bot: ironmagma: ReferenceError: window is not defined
23:34  ironmagma: v8> this
23:34  v8bot: ironmagma: {}
23:34  ironmagma: v8> self
23:34  v8bot: ironmagma: ReferenceError: self is not defined
23:34  Pilum: self is part of the DOM too.
23:34  Sorella: darkredandyellow ≣ at any rate, it's because instanceof only works on Objects, and "foo" is a primitive. Instanceof is basically x.constructor === y
23:34  wkmanire: Ok, back in a flash. Going to see if that will work for me.
23:34  ironmagma: any difference in self vs. window?
23:35  wkmanire: ha ha ha
23:35  wkmanire: I'll be damned.
23:35  Pilum: self references the current window.
23:35  Sorella: darkredandyellow ≣ also, instanceof will fail for cross-frame testing, because the objects won't be the same, so you should avoid using it if you need cross-frame stuff. Use Object.prototype.toString.call(object-to-test) instead.
23:35 * Pilum wonders...
23:35  Pilum: `dom ref self
23:35  jsBot: dom ref self: Returns an object reference to the window object. (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.self)
23:35  wkmanire: Not only does it work, but I've made a bunch of big mistakes all over the place using "parent" as a member of heirarchical structures.
23:35  ironmagma: `dom ref window
23:36  wkmanire: I never realized it was reserved even on my own objects.
23:36  Sorella: Pilum ≣ js nor v8 have DOOMs
23:36  Sorella: jseval window
23:36  ironmagma: `dom ref self
23:36  jsBot: dom ref self: Returns an object reference to the window object. (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.self)
23:36  Pilum: Pardon?
23:36  ironmagma: `dom ref window
23:36  Sorella: and buubot ain't around
23:36  darkredandyellow: Sorella, I see - so : new String("foo") is NOT the same as "foo", cause in the first case JS gives back a "real" object whereas in the second one a primitive?
23:36  ironmagma: maybe window isn't part of the specified DOM or something?
23:37  Sorella: darkredandyellow ≣ yes. You shouldn't use new for any primitive tho.
23:37  Pilum: Sorella: I haven't been trying to access anything DOM in either. :-)
23:37  ironmagma: meh, no. looks like self is a property of window
23:37  ironmagma: which sounds kind of pointless
23:37  wkmanire: Pilum, ironmagma: I need to understand this completely because I've been doing a ton of javascript work. Is there a book or a website I should check out to get the details on this built in heirarchy?
23:37  Sorella: v8> new Number(1) == new Number(1)
23:37  v8bot: Sorella: false
23:38  Pilum: wkmanire: I generally use MDC.
23:38  darkredandyellow: Sorella, then what should I use instead? just the "foo" instead of "new String...."?
23:38  Sorella: the w3c specs on the DOM model are a pretty good start, wkmanire
23:38  ironmagma: wkmanire: not that I know of (maybe JavaScript: The Definitive Guide?). it's not really that complex; window refers to the current window, top refers to as high as you can get, parent refers to one-level-up
23:38  Sorella: darkredandyellow ≣ yes. Avoid `new` like the plague.
23:38  Sorella: for primitives, at least
23:38  wkmanire: I'm just surprised that I can get this far and write this much code and not see this concept anywhere before.
23:39  darkredandyellow: Sorella, I understand (at least I think I do). Thanks a lot for the explanation.
23:39  peeps[lappy]: isn't there some creative commons site with a bunch of images that you can browse? i can't find it.  the search on creative commons site just give google results that suck
23:39  Sorella: use "foo" instead of new String("foo"), 1 instead of new Number(1), [] instead of new Array(), {} instead of new Object()
23:39  ironmagma: wkmanire: it's probably good that you haven't seen it, means we're moving away from frames.
23:39  wkmanire: ironmagma: I've never used them. The only reason I'm using it here is because I want to post files to the server without posting the whole page.
23:40  wkmanire: ironmagma: as far as I know you can't send files via XHR.
23:41  ironmagma: yeah, I don't think you can either
23:42  wkmanire: Well, once again this channel proves to be an invaluable resource. Thanks guys.
23:43  miamiseb: I've got a pretty frustrating problem that is difficult for me to reproduce on it's own. I'm almost sure it related to being done in asp.net but...basically, I have a setTimeout that even if I set it to 100000000, will execute the alert immediately.
23:43  ironmagma: wkmanire: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596000480 if you need to know your stuff
23:44  wkmanire: ironmagma: I'll check it out. I read javascript: the good parts and stopped there.
23:44  ironmagma: miamiseb: pastebin?
23:44  wkmanire: ironmagma: I figured I could weasel my way through the DOM on my own.
23:44  wkmanire: irognmagma: turned out I was wrong.
23:44  miamiseb: http://pastebin.com/zFiFrr6n
23:44  ironmagma: wkmanire: the book I mentioned is actually the only book the author of JSTGP recommends :P
23:45  ironmagma: miamiseb: take out the ()
23:45  wkmanire: miamiseb: You're calling your function immediately by placing the parens on it.
23:45  ironmagma: window.setTimeout(redir,5000);
23:45  miamiseb: seriously?
23:45  wkmanire: Yep
23:45  miamiseb: because I've been working on this for about an hour.
23:45 * miamiseb dies.
23:45  wkmanire: he he he
23:46  miamiseb: wow. Yup.
23:46 * miamiseb puts on newb hat and sits in the corner.
23:46  miamiseb: Thanks.
23:47  wkmanire: window.setTimeout(firststep(),10000); means in 10000 milliseconds try to execute the return value of executing firststep right now.
23:52  Pilum: Yes.
23:53  Pilum: Functions can return functions. :-)
23:53  FernandoBasso: What is the name of the += operator?
23:53  FernandoBasso: Like num += 1;
23:54  wkmanire: ? plus-equals?
23:54  wkmanire: Like when read out-loud?
23:55  Pilum: Falls into the category of assignment operators.
23:56  FernandoBasso: Or is it "the plus shorthanded operator" :D
23:56  miamiseb: it's just one of the binary operators, it's primarily an assignment operator (=)
23:57  miamiseb: Wiki says wkmanire is correct. And we all know wiki is always right.
23:57  miamiseb: Many of the operators containing multi-character sequences are given "names" built from the operator name of each character. For example, += and -= are often called plus equal(s) and minus equal(s), instead of the more verbose "assignment by addition" and "assignment by subtraction".
23:58 * wkmanire chuckles.
23:59  FernandoBasso: wkmanire: Wins the prize. miamiseb Please, give him the prize. :)
23:59  FernandoBasso: wkmanire: It will be deposited in your account tomorrow morning.
23:59  miamiseb: I would but...
