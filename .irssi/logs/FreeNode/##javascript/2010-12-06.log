00:05  joobie: guys i have a string which is like "1,4,3,5".. is there a good way of converting this to an array? so I can refer to '1' as [0], '4' as [1] and so forth?
00:05  quest88: yes
00:06  wkmanire: js> '1,2,3,5'.split(',')
00:06  quest88: youstring.split(',')
00:06  gbot2: wkmanire: ["1","2","3","5"]
00:06  joobie: temp.split(',');
00:06  joobie: i tried that
00:06  luneff: :)
00:06  joobie: but then if i do temp[1] it is ","
00:07  quest88: no
00:07  joobie: it's like each character is coming through as its own array element
00:07  quest88: temp = temp.split(',')
00:07  quest88: split returns an array
00:07  quest88: you need something to hold it
00:07  joobie: do i need to do var temp = []; first?
00:07  quest88: no
00:07  wkmanire: joobie: Would you mind pastebin'ing the code?
00:07  quest88: var something = temp.split(',')
00:07  joobie: ahh ok ill try
00:08  joobie: that worked thanks :)
00:08  quest88: no problem
00:09  joobie: ive got this complex code im trying to do (Well complex for me at least).. i'll be abck in about 15 mins :P want to try get this working so i can show a demo to see how i can improve on it
00:09  joobie: i know it's just messy as - just not sure how to clean it.. cheers :)

00:36  krambiorix: lol ironmagma
00:36  ironmagma: metropolis: I don't think so. maybe you should start a library
00:36  wkmanire: randomOfAmber: Take a look at rhino or node.js I think those might be able to help you.
00:36  krambiorix: so ironmagma found nothing?
00:37 --- Channel ##javascript was synced in 143 seconds
00:38  randomOfAmber: wkmanire: ok, I'll do that
00:38  peeps[lappy]: randomOfAmber, are you talking about client side javascript?  the only way to "call" servide side code from the client side is with another request (ajax)
00:39  ironmagma: krambiorix: it actually works for me. what browser are you using?
00:39  krambiorix: ironmagma, FF
00:39  ironmagma: version, OS?
00:39  ironmagma: are you certain the problem is in that code?
00:40  krambiorix: ironmagma, FF3 on Ubuntu
00:40  ironmagma: e.g. are you certain that the document is ready when the function is called, and explain why you need parent.
00:40  krambiorix: ironmagma, yeah
00:40  wkmanire: joobie: Anyway, on your algorithm. Its clean with appropriate comments. You could take a stab at ironmagma's suggestion, but honestly if it ain't broke why fix it?
00:40  krambiorix: ironmagma, i use tinybox and that tinybox opens another one
00:41  wkmanire: joobie: I can't imagine thats taking more than 1ms to run.
00:41  _Absolut: Hi, does anybodyknows What's wrong on it?
00:41  _Absolut: var cstr = " ";
00:41  _Absolut: var cstrlen = cstr.length;
00:41  ironmagma: krambiorix: both on the same domain?
00:41  krambiorix: ironmagma, yup
00:41  wkmanire: js> var cstr = " "; var cstrlen = cstr.length; cstrlen;
00:41  gbot2: wkmanire: 1
00:41  wkmanire: _Absolut: whats the problem exactly?
00:42  _Absolut: wkmanire: Says undefined
00:42  ironmagma: krambiorix: checked the js console?
00:42  roughnecks: hi
00:42  wkmanire: _Absolut: What is undefined?
00:42  _Absolut: wkmanire: cstrlen
00:42  krambiorix: ironmagma, yup, nothing
00:43  wkmanire: _Absolut: I put your code into the IRC javascript evaluator and it returned a length of 1.
00:43  wkmanire: _Absolut: the problem must be somewhere else in your code.
00:43  ironmagma: krambiorix: check the values of all assigned variables, see if anything looks weird.
00:44  krambiorix: ironmagma, tbody.rows.count  is undefined
00:44  _Absolut: wkmanire: OK, thanks. Maybe the browser is tierd :)
00:44  roughnecks: i'd like to ask if somebody can check 2 scripts for me and see if there is something wrong with one of the, which does not work and i dont' know why: http://pastebin.com/WFEVRhXR  http://pastebin.com/3w3m8ZnT
00:44  wkmanire: _Absolut: he he he, could be.
00:44  roughnecks: thanks
00:44  ironmagma: krambiorix: well, I can't help you with that since you never posted that code
00:45  krambiorix: ironmagma, i did
00:45  krambiorix: ow ok
00:45  wkmanire: roughnecks: Are you asking us to be a human diff utility?
00:45 * wkmanire smiles.
00:46  roughnecks: :D I've no idea of what it's wrong
00:46  roughnecks: the only thing i kmow is that one of them is broken
00:46  wkmanire: roughnecks: How do you know that?
00:47  roughnecks: they are part of a chess webclient
00:47  roughnecks: with one version the function works, the other fails
00:47  wkmanire: Which one works?
00:47  _Absolut: wkmanire:Where can I find the IRC javascript evaluator?
00:47  roughnecks: wait
00:47  wkmanire: _Absolut: type js > expression
00:48  wkmanire: js> var greeting="Hello World!"; greeting;
00:48  gbot2: wkmanire: "Hello World!"
00:48  roughnecks: this one works: http://pastebin.com/WFEVRhXR
00:48  ironmagma: roughnecks: it's pretty impossible to help you when it's unknown what the scripts are supposed to do, what's wrong with them, and what the functions called do.
00:48  _Absolut: js>var cstr;
00:48 * wkmanire sighs.
00:49  _Absolut: var cstrlen = cstr.length;
00:49  wkmanire: ironmagma: Thank you.
00:49  roughnecks: heheh, i see, but dont know how to help you further to help me :)
00:49  wkmanire: roughnecks: Don't know any javascript?
00:49  roughnecks: nope
00:50  ironmagma: roughnecks: so why are you trying to fix someone else's code?
00:50  wkmanire: I'll be back in a few.
00:50  roughnecks: i've asked for help to them, but noone replies to me
00:51  roughnecks: they don't have a bug tracking system either
00:51  roughnecks: so i wanted to fix this things

01:12  wkmanire: Areks: What happened?
01:12  Areks: error and stop script
01:14  wkmanire: Areks: Just a sec, I'm reading your code.
01:15  miamiseb: Thanks for the help all. Have a good afternoon.
01:16  wkmanire: Areks: So you want to extend jQuery to insert a label  like this $("#myDiv").CheckBoxNew(myClass) and give it the css classname myclass?
01:16  Areks: yes
01:17  wkmanire: var newCheckbox = $('<label class="'+ItemClass+'" for="'+$(this).attr("id")+'">&nbsp;</label>') is going to return a label HTMLElement I believe.
01:17  wkmanire: But later on in the code you try to call jQuery functions from the HTMLElement.
01:18  wkmanire: the label itself will not get all of the jQuery methods attached to it.
01:18  Areks: wkmanire: no, it return jquery object
01:18  wkmanire: So anywhere you use the label you need to wrap it in a $().
01:18  Areks: because it wort in firefox
01:18  wkmanire: Areks: Let me verify that, hold on.
01:19  peeps[lappy]: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
01:19  peeps[lappy]: it does return jquery object
01:21  wkmanire: peeps[lappy] is right.
01:22  wkmanire: It returns an array that contains the newly created element.
01:24  wkmanire: and instanceof jQuery on the returned object returns true.
01:25  Areks: it should work
01:26  Areks: if i write  $(newCheckbox).css('margin') it works, but if i want to get background it return erorr
01:26  wkmanire: Yep, the css function returns undefined in IE 8.
01:26  wkmanire: But it works in chrome.
01:26  wkmanire: Exact same code.
01:27  wkmanire: Doesn't matter if I use backgroundPosition or background-position.
01:27  Areks: wkmanire: and firefox and safary and opera
01:27  wkmanire: Areks: I'll try IE 7 compatibility mode.
01:27  Areks: fucking ie
01:27  Areks: (
01:27  wkmanire: Same.
01:27  wkmanire: Doesn't work.
01:28  wkmanire: Areks: Did you look in the jQuery bug tracker?
01:28  Areks: wkmanire: no
01:28  peeps[lappy]: also, there's a #jquery channel
01:28  Areks: i think i should look in ie bug tracker )))
01:29  wkmanire: Areks: Sure, but jQuery is supposed to wrap these things, and like it or not IE is still the most used browser.
01:29  wkmanire: Areks: It shouldn't be returning undefined here I think.
01:30  Areks: yes it return undefined
01:30  peeps[lappy]: there's no way to get a path relative to your js file is there?
01:34  wkmanire: See you all later.

02:22  RichardLynch: Given that I'm a plug-in in an iframe in a much larger application, and I'd like to "extend" window.onload, maintaining whatever is already in there, if anything, and working on as many semi-modern browsers as possible, what do I do?...  I've googled a bit, but got mostly confused by the answers...  I'm a back-end PHP guy, really...
02:24  factor: Anyone use Qooxdoo in here?
02:26  dnyy: l4rk: was a question, hah
02:26  dnyy: would've been rude as an accusation, didn't mean it like that though
02:26  RichardLynch: Is this better:  http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/onloads/  or have the browser wars gotten to the point where there's a reliable way to attach another event to window.onload
02:28  l4rk: RichardLynch: you can use addEventListener but you won't be supporting ie 8 and below
02:28  l4rk: there really aren't wars, just IE not supporting that function
02:28  l4rk: if you want IE just add a check for addEvent
02:28  l4rk: errrr attachEvent
02:31  RichardLynch: Errrr.  Is there an IE9 already???
02:31  RichardLynch: LOL
02:32  RichardLynch: If I have to check and run different code for IE, then I might as well use addLoadEvent.  Seems cleaner than custom code for each browser.

02:53  Xenc: how do i get the keys
02:53  ironmagma: first off..
02:53  ironmagma: you want to use object.hasOwnProperty(i)
02:53  ironmagma: to make sure the key isn't inherited somehow

02:53  l4rk: if you're in a fun browser

03:14  Xenc: its a manually crafted obj every time but it wouldn't hurt to have

03:54  Brown3218: @guest88 like this?

05:18  joobie: guys i have two arrays, one main one called feedData.feed and the other called JSONobject['feedData']['feed'] .. If i want to access part of the existing array for example i call "feedData.feed[0].itemId" or of the temporary array I call "JSONojbect['feedData']['feed'][0].itemId" .. how can i merge the temp array into the main, without overwriting the main??
05:18  joobie: i want to join the array in at the same level on the main array
05:19  joobie: ie. join it at the feed part
05:19  ironmagma: go one by one and append the elements of the second array to the end of the first array
05:19  joobie: isnt there a merge type way to do it?
05:19  ironmagma: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
05:20  joobie: .. without jquery :P
05:20  ironmagma: nope
05:20  gkatsev: you can concat 2 arrays
05:20  joobie: ahh k
05:20  joobie: how so gkatsev, without query?:P
05:20  gkatsev: `ref mdc array.concat
05:20  v8bot: gkatsev: concat - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat
05:20  joobie: thanks
05:20  aurilliance: Anyone able to answer my q? ^^
05:21  gkatsev: aurilliance: yes
05:21  aurilliance: gkatsev: yes it is always the same?
05:21  gkatsev: aurilliance: assuming the variable isn't likely to be 0
05:21  ironmagma: note that that creates a third array so you should delete the old arrays if they're no longer needed
05:21  aurilliance: gkatsev: good catch.
05:21  aurilliance: thanks
05:21  gkatsev: aurilliance: np
05:24  joobie: gkatsev, would feedData.feed.concat(JSONobject.feedData.feed); do ?
05:24  joobie: i seem to be merging this incorrectly
05:24  joobie: feedData.feed[index] is what i want to increment, on the index
05:25  gkatsev: joobie: as ironmagma mentioned, concat returns a new array. so, you'd need to do var newArray = feedData.feed.concat(JSONobject.feedData.feed);
05:25  gkatsev: joobie: or you could save it back to feedData.feed
05:30  joobie: ahh
05:30  joobie: thanks gkatsev
05:30  joobie: feedData.feed = feedData.feed.concat(JSONobject.feedData.feed);
05:30  joobie: like this ya?
05:32  gkatsev: yep
05:34  joobie: hmmm.. i think it's working - but might have a bug in the code elsewhere.. checking
05:34  joobie: getting some weird behaviour
05:37  joobie: gkatsev, is ther a simple way to dump out an array structure in JS?
05:37  joobie: i use print_r($array) in php and it dumps the whole structure
05:38  joobie: would make this debugging a heap easier
05:38  quest88: joobie, http://www.openjs.com/scripts/others/dump_function_php_print_r.php
05:38  quest88: I use this often
05:38  gkatsev: console.log or console.dir
05:46  joobie: thanks
05:48  joobie: hehe
05:48  joobie: quest88, have you tried that on a BIG ASS array?
05:48  joobie: i never knew alert boxes could have a scroll effect as they populate :P
05:48  quest88: joobie, nope, no too big
05:48  joobie: cheers tho - exactly what i was after
05:48  quest88: lol
05:48  quest88: good
05:48 * doc|home considers the implementation of an ass array
05:49  Gregor: doc|home: Is that an array of asses, or an array, the storage format of which is an ass?
05:49  doc|home: Gregor: either way, happy times!
05:50  Gregor: Agreed.
06:02  owen1: x = {main: ['left', 'right']}  how to find the first key and first value of that key?  (main is just an example)
06:04  owen1: in ruby i would do x.keys.first and x.values.first
06:06  ironmagma: javascript would slaughter your ruby code
06:07  ironmagma: owen1: there's not really a "first value"
06:09  owen1: every object only have 1 key and 1 value?
06:10  ironmagma: then it's not the first value, it's the only value
06:10  owen1: yeah..
06:10  ironmagma: hold on a second

06:13  ironmagma: owen1: put this somewhere in your code(preferably before) http://pastebin.com/15fMwNsw
06:13  ironmagma: owen1: then use x.keys()
06:14  owen1: ironmagma: looking into it. thanks!

06:21  Maxdamantus: There's no necessary order to for(.. in ..) afaik

06:22  Maxdamantus: eg, keep your own array of keys as you append properties to the object.
06:23  eMyller: and try code at your local console first. :P
06:24  ironmagma: yeah, sorry :P
06:24  ironmagma: owen1: http://pastebin.com/ickmggXi

06:27  gbot2: Maxdamantus: "hello"
06:28  ironmagma: woah, didn't know js had that syntax
06:28  Maxdamantus: It's not ECMAScript.
06:28  Maxdamantus: Just JS, 1.7 I think.
06:28  Gregor: Read: Just Mozilla
06:29  Maxdamantus: JS is Mozilla's.
06:29  ironmagma: is Mozilla formerly netscape or something?
06:29  Maxdamantus: Not really.
06:29  Gregor: Maxdamantus: The name "JavaScript" is officially Mozilla's, yes. JavaScript is not, by any reasonable definition, Mozilla's.
06:29  Maxdamantus: I think Breden Eich started Mozilla after Netscape died or something
06:30  Maxdamantus: Mmm.. The name is usually misused.
06:30  Cork: Maxdamantus: no, mozilla is based from the opensourced version of netscape
06:30  Gregor: Maxdamantus: Mozilla was an internal project name of Netscape all along. When Netscape went apeshit, Brendan et al forked and founded the Mozilla foundation.
06:30  Cork: Maxdamantus: they derived it from the main company
06:30  Maxdamantus: They should allow script="text/ecmascript"
06:31  Maxdamantus: Ah, I meant the companies, not the products.
06:31  Maxdamantus: Mozilla Foundation, Netscape Communications or whatever.. Gregor seems to know more anyway.
06:31  Gregor: Gregor knows all :P
06:32  Gregor: It's hilarious that Brown3218 came in just in time to see me being a jackass.
06:32  Maxdamantus: Heh.
06:33  ironmagma: still annoys me that navigator.appName returns Netscape on firefox
06:34  owen1: i try to convert a recursive method i wrote in ruby that takes an array and turn it into html - http://pastebin.com/SPNz3DkE
06:34  Gregor: ironmagma: navigator.appName is pretty much a bad joke nowadays :P
06:34  sacho: at least it returns mozilla on ie
06:34  owen1: ironmagma: i run your code in the console and i get no such method - keys
06:35  owen1: ironmagma: can i use Maxdamantus's way?
06:35  owen1: or is it not supported?
06:35  Maxdamantus: owen1: don't count on it working in any browsers other than Firefox 3.7+
06:35  owen1: Maxdamantus: oh. ok
06:35  Maxdamantus: (Not sure about that version number)
06:36  owen1: i'll try ironmagma way again.
06:36  Maxdamantus: Wait, if it's 1.7 it should've worked for like a year.
06:36  Brown3218: I need some help with a script I'm working on in a google spreadsheet
06:37  Brown3218: Does anyone have a minute to look at it?
06:37  owen1: ironmagma: works!
06:37  Maxdamantus: owen1: do you care about order?
06:38  owen1: Maxdamantus: i am not sure i am doing the right thing. can u look at my code and tell me if my algorithem is correct? http://pastebin.com/SPNz3DkE
06:39  Maxdamantus: Is this Ruby?
06:39  Maxdamantus: Looks like Python I think, but without the colons.
06:39  owen1: i turn ['help', 'account'] to <ul><li>help</li><li>account</li></ul>
06:39  owen1: ruby
06:39  owen1: pretty, ah (-:
06:40  Maxdamantus: JS doesn't really have something like [ 'help', 'accout', feed: ['top', main: ['left', 'right'] ] ]
06:40  owen1: yeah, it's ruby's syntax
06:40  owen1: feed: [] is an object
06:40  owen1: ["help",{"account":["navigation"]},{"feed":["nav","main"]}]
06:41  Maxdamantus: Ah.
06:41  owen1: this is what my webservice return to the client. it's json
06:41  owen1: i need to turn it into nested html list
06:42  owen1: i am looping on each element,
06:42  owen1: if it's a string i just add <li>element</li>
06:42  Maxdamantus: I'm not really familiar with this language or HTML generation system.
06:42  owen1: if it's not a string i call the same method on the first value
06:43  owen1: so it's a simple recursion. i am not sure if i do the correct thing, when i take the first value of the object
06:44  owen1: i guess it's fine since each object can only have 1 key. still thinking..
06:45  inimino: owen1 ⋱ Try #ruby
06:45  owen1: inimino: i am doing it in js
06:45  Maxdamantus: I'm concerned about the apparent assumption of order.
06:45  inimino: owen1 ⋱ Where's the JavaScript?
06:45  inimino: I only see Ruby here.
06:46  owen1: inimino: oh. i am in the middle of rerwite. a few more minutes..

09:52  ironmagma: grayatrox:
09:52  ironmagma: grayatrox:

10:59  ironmagma: wonder why that is. it seems to have the exact same functionality
11:00  FireFly|n900: parseInt with one argument checks for octal and other stuff as well, though
11:00  FireFly|n900: Try comparing against parseInt(foo, 10) perhaps
11:00  ironmagma: this is true

11:06  Sorella: ironmagma ≣ ~~ is a double bitwise not, and unlike parseInt (which also should be avoided for strict string->int conversions) it'll only work with 32 bits. You can look it as basically int32(-(x + 1))

13:40  irfaN: var hede = function() {};
13:40  irfaN: is this should be work ?
13:40  Cork: no it won't
13:41  Cork: your declaring hede after your refering to it
13:41  irfaN: okay, soo..
13:41  irfaN: var a = hede; var hede = function() {};
13:41  irfaN: $(document).bind('click', a);
13:41  Cork: nope
13:42  irfaN: i cant define method name with string ?
13:42  Cork: var hede = function() {}; var a = hede; $(docuemnt)...
13:42  irfaN: yes! you right..
13:42  Cork: or you need to use function hede() {}
13:45  irfaN: but i was parse "hede" from html element.. this means it is coming dynamically from dom.. is this possible ?
13:45  molgrew: what exactly?
13:45  Cork: irfaN: you would have to do the bind after the html is added
13:46  Cork: else the function doesn't exist
13:47  irfaN: Cork, http://pastebin.com/UrPe58fm
13:48  irfaN: i want use function name dynamically.. if body id defined about, i want be call about function
13:48  Cork: wtf...
13:48  irfaN: it is impossible ?
13:49  Cork: your trying to run a string as a function,..
13:49  Cork: does this function even exist?
13:49  irfaN: no, you right..
13:49  irfaN: but i defined in the bottom
13:50  Cork: if the function is a global function you can do something like .bind(event, window[callback]);
13:51  Cork: else it won't work
13:51  irfaN: if html like that <body id="about"> i wanto trigger "about.myproject" event and handle with the about function..
13:51  irfaN: its bad idea ?
13:52  Cork: do you have an about function?
13:52  Cork: deflared?
13:52  Cork: *declared
13:52  irfaN: yes, you can see in the bottom
13:53  irfaN: http://pastebin.com/UrPe58fm
13:53  Cork: where is that declared?
13:53  Cork: in the same function doing the red of the actions?

13:54  Cork: irfaN: yes, but your code doesn't have any context
13:54  Cork: where is this code run?
13:54  irfaN: i was write but its not work with the code
13:54  irfaN: http://pastebin.com/jUbLhs55
13:55  Cork: irfaN: you need to give me context for the code, i can't tell what will work or not from that code
13:56  irfaN: i use the code with <body id="about"> html page.. okay, i preparing for test..
14:05  irfaN: Cork, http://irfandurmus.com/test/

15:28  dgEAPerez: in paste in i publish the "relevant" code :$
15:29  paxcoder: dgEAPerez, .offsetWidth returns a string. You must parseInt to get a number. However, this number will be in those units (em, px, pt, %) that you have specified its width in.
15:29  preaction: babbos: why do you need this?
15:30  dgEAPerez: "default"

15:31  paxcoder: molgrew, i can test it, but yeah. pretty sure.
15:31  molgrew: test it please
15:31  paxcoder: dgEAPerez, that is, if you haven't set it to be anything previously, it will be an empty string.

16:20  Arcifer: Greetings, i'm having troubles refreshing my whole page using a javascript, (When i push a form button, i run a function, and after that function us finished i want the page to refresh) . Something is really fishy
16:20  Arcifer: I'm not sure if it has to do with me having some php code aswell, definetly annoying though
16:20  Wes: Hmm, looks like it made into HTML5: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Element.scrollIntoView
16:20  molgrew: Wes: it'll be in html5 and is a de-facto one at the moment
16:21  Brown3218: Here is a link to what I'm working on: https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AnVTJLrKrQo_dFk3RXVqdEF1U2gxeFY3NC1qOTRiV3c&hl=en&authkey=CNTxjoUB
16:21  Wes: google docs spreadsheets allow you to manipulate cells with javascript? neat!
16:22  Brown3218: Yes. They have a a javascript editor
16:22  Brown3218: Its pretty cool what I have so far. I'm just stuck. Do you have a minute to look at it?
16:23  Wes: Brown3218: Maybe. I'm decaffeinated ATM, so no thinking skills, lol
16:23  molgrew: Arcifer: you would need to explain and describe some more
16:23  Wes: Brown3218: what are you trying to do?
16:23  Arcifer: molgrew if you want i can pastie the code
16:23  Brown3218: Is that you in there right now?
16:23  Brown3218: There is a chat in there
16:24  Wes: Yes, but I like IRC
16:25  Brown3218: ok
16:25  Brown3218: Well you see, this is an inventory list
16:25  Brown3218: If you go to the sheet "November"
16:26  Brown3218: I'm trying to make it so when I order a stock item, it updates the inventory
16:27  Brown3218: So it will search column C for the part number and add how many i've ordered
16:27  Arcifer: molgrew: http://pastie.org/1352320 , When i press a form button, i want the whole page to reload, as you see, i added window.location, but it seems to refresh everything except what i want refreshed (i want the div with- or the list that the php code generates, to refresh)
16:27  Arcifer: or the whole page, thats fine too
16:27  Brown3218: the script can be found in Tools>Script>script editor
16:28  Wes: Brown3218: scripts is greyed out, probably only you can see them
16:28  Brown3218: oh, i forgot. Can i share the doc with your account and then you can see it
16:28  Wes: Brown3218: Are you having a problem with javascript (the language), or are you having trouble with the google docs API?
16:28  Brown3218: Javascript
16:28  Wes: Pastebin the script - just like any other JS problem :)
16:29  Brown3218: http://pastebin.com/FEcLsFpT
16:30  Brown3218: I don't really have the script i need started. The one i just pasted is similar but does something different
16:31  Wes: Brown3218: Reminds me of doing VBScript in Excel a bajillion years ago
16:31  Wes: Brown3218: So, what's your question?
16:31  molgrew: Arcifer: well, there's a problem in lines 109 and 110, execution of function OnSubmitForm stops before 110
16:32  Brown3218: Well. In Sheet "November" I need it so when column E has the word "Stock" it searches for the part # in column C and then updates the quantity from column B
16:32  Brown3218: I'm just not sure how to do that
16:32  Arcifer: molgrew it still didnt matter that i put the reload a few places higher up, i tried to move it around, and write different versions of it, but all of it displayed the same result, it refreshes, but the menu stays the same
16:33  molgrew: Arcifer: what menu?
16:33  Wes: Brown3218: did you write the script you just pasted? Do you understand the APIs you're using?  (Do you have a programming background?)_
16:33  molgrew: and should it actually change?
16:34  Brown3218: Wes, I had significant help. I'm new to this and learning a bit as I go.
16:34  Arcifer: molgrew, as you can see in the sourcecode, i use php to parse an xml feed, and make the result (TITLE) into menu entries,
16:34  _sudo: amuse me peasants
16:34  molgrew: I don't know php, sorry
16:34  Arcifer: molgrew, you dont have to know php. its the javascript i need help with
16:34  Arcifer: i need the mainpage to reload properly
16:35  molgrew: to achieve what? that the "menu" changes?
16:35  Arcifer: aye
16:35  Wes: Brown3218: Okay, so what you need isn't really javascript help per se, it's programming 101.   Take the sentence you just posted ("I need it so that..") -- break up each clause in the sentence to a concise description, translate to code and go
16:35  molgrew: why should that work?
16:35  Arcifer: I could tell you briefly what the purpose of the page is
16:36  Wes: Brown3218: i.e. "search"  can be broken up into  "compare each element for value" - then "each" gives you a clue that you want to iterate over the list, i.e. with a loop
16:36  Wes: Brown3218: The very first thing you should do, though, is understand each and every word in that original script
16:36  Wes: Brown3218: Feel free to ask questions like "Why is parseInt() used here?"   "What is NaN?"  etc
16:36  Brown3218: ok
16:37  Brown3218: I have been avoiding that, because it's a lot of work, but you are correct.
16:37  Arcifer: Its for reviewing wiki articles,  the menu shows all articles that are not reviewed, and when you press the button called "Godkänd", the first submit button, it sends an API query making the article flagged as OK, that means that the article no longer should be on the menu list, therfore it should be removed by refreshing the menu, and making space for one more aticle
16:37  Arcifer: article*
16:37  Wes: Yep.  There's only two choices here -- either somebody does the work for you, or you understand what you're doing.  And I (like most here) don't mind teaching how to fish, but I'll be damned if I'll cook for ya. :)
16:38  Brown3218: From what i've seen. When it says "var" what follows after that is a nickname or shortcut throughout that script?
16:39  _sudo: lol
16:39  Brown3218: So if i write Var parts =gfdgfdgfdgfdgfdg. Then everytime i write "parts" it thinks its gfdgdgdfgdgfdg
16:39  Wes: Brown3218: Wow! You are right at the beginning.  (Somebody here post a link to that JS tutorial site?)
16:39  _sudo: not even JS.  He doesn't know what a variable is
16:39  Wes: Brown3218:   var X = Y;    -- assigns a variable (like in algebra) named X which refers to the value of the expression Y
16:40  Brown3218: That is what i was thinking, but you say it much more beautifully
16:40  Wes: _sudo: Everybody has to start somewhere, but he is certainly learning to swim by jumping off the dock.
16:40  Brown3218: Do you reccomend a specific tutorial?
16:42  Arcifer: Can anyone please explain why i cant refresh the whole page properly when i press the submit buttons? func OnSubmitForm() http://pastie.org/1352320
16:43  Wes: Brown3218: I'm googling -- haven't had to look a CS101-type resources in a long while

16:48  Wes: Brown3218: Since you're using Google Apps, everywhere you see things like "The browser DOM" in the abstract, just think in your head "The Google Apps Environemnt"
16:48  Brown3218: ok
16:49  Brown3218: Is API the specific version of it?
16:49  Wes: Brown3218: Normally JS exists in the browser, so all texts will talk about the browser as the sort of "universe"; you are in a different universe but using the same syntax and concepts
16:50  Wes: Brown3218: API -- "application programming interface" -- the functions you use to communicate with the Google Apps spreadsheet (like SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet())
16:50  Brown3218: Got it
16:50  Brown3218: And those are specific to the application
16:51  Wes: Brown3218: Right. The API for the web browser is called "the DOM", "document object module"; all the examples you will see will use that, but you'll be using the google stuff instead
16:53  Wes: FWIW, JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan is a good introductory book; there is a chapter called "Core JavaScript" which just talks about the stuff in JavaScript itself, divorced from any APIs that are browser (or wherever) specific
16:55  Brown3218: This will give me a good start

17:11  Wes: pigdude: That is a pretty serious WTF.  I bet that guy calls radio stations and complains when they play "Imagine"  by John Lennon
17:11  big_ham: need some js code to allow an image ti scroll with the user. image starts straddling the "fold", but as user scrolls down, I want it to stick to the top of the viewport
17:11  Wes: Aikar: Sure - Node's just done a good job of attracting more users than anybody else
17:12  Aikar: Wes: what other projects are therE? i know of rhino but i havent heard anything on it really
17:12  paxcoder: dgEAPerez, here.
17:12  pigdude: Wes: hehe yea CLJ is a fun place :^D
17:13  Wes: Aikar: Rhino's just an engine.   There is GPSEE (mine), APE, Flusspferd, RingoJS, WhiteBeam, GLUEScript, Narwhal, v8cgi, and a bunch more I'm sure have slipped my mind
17:13  Aikar: err Ringo is what i meant sorry
17:13  dgEAPerez: thanks... perhaps your partner is very bussy... could you give me a hand? :$
17:13  Wes: "just an engine" - i.e. implements only JavaScript, although the extra object Java.Packages is pretty damned powerful
17:13  dgEAPerez: with this stuff about width of my "div hell" :S
17:16  Wes: pigdude: Geez, just scanning CLJ, it seems more like a place to pick up STDs and stolen watches than JavaScript tips
17:17  rmah: CLJ?
17:17  Wes: comp.lang.javascript
17:17  Aikar: ive heard bad things about CLJ about some famous troll there
17:17  rmah: ah c.l.j
17:17  rmah: haven't used USENET in years and years
17:18  Wes: me neither. I am waiting for October 1993. ;)
17:19  Aikar: i think usenets primarily down to being used for file sharing now lol. and devs using google groups
17:22 --- monsterkiller is now known as MonsterKiller
17:27 * Maxdamantus is also slowly making an irssi module for JS (Spidermonkey) scripts.
17:28  Aikar: that would be nice, perl can diaf
17:28  Aikar: i started a PHP based irc bot (phpib.com) but now i dont want to finish it as id rather do it in js now lol
17:30  Gregor: *clapclap*
17:31  gkatsev: there's already a js ircbot by gf3, though, I guess another one or two wouldn't hurt
17:32  gkatsev: Usenet is great for file sharing, though, lol
17:33  Aikar: i meant design a bot like eggdrop designed to be shared, modules, user management etc. that gf3 bot looks very 'specific'
17:34  gf3: Jerk is meant to be an easy lib to make bots, quickly
17:34  Aikar: ah
17:34  Aikar: so its 2 parts
17:34  Aikar: i just saw the jerk part
17:35  gf3: Aikar: I wrote IRC-js, which is a general purpose IRC library
17:35  gkatsev: there is also protobot which is a functional bot over it
17:35  gf3: Aikar: and Jerk, which is a simple bot lib
17:35  gf3: Aikar: if you want to build something more powerful, you might want to build it on top of: https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js
17:35  gkatsev: gf3: how come `Jerk' btw?
17:36  gf3: gkatsev: it's a play on JIRC, sounds like Jerk
17:36  Aikar: yeah i dont plan on doing it any time soon. im trying to start a serious project i need to focus on. creating a game and writing the server in node
17:36  gkatsev: gf3: ah, ok, lol
17:36  gkatsev: node ftw!
17:37  Aikar: been doing alot of planning/designing/researching, i think i got a baseline layed out now ready to really start working on it
17:38  Aikar: with mongodb for db, json based DB, js client, js server lol.... javascript ftw :3
17:38  gkatsev: BSON, really, but yeah
17:38  Aikar: well the way you interact with it in your code is still json :P but yeah sent as bson
17:39  dgEAPerez: hello.. it´s there a way to know the width of a div created on the fly?
17:39  Aikar: i just got the node-msgpack library compiled for node 0.3.1 going to make use of that as they report some big speed advantages over json parse/stringify
17:42  _sudo: is mongoDb web scale?
17:42  Aikar: it might just be!
17:42  Aikar: i hear its not as fast as the /dev/null db though
17:42  _sudo: dev null is web scale?
17:43  [1]pallet: can someone look as some JS and help me ;) http://pastebin.com/QU0FNczF
17:43  gkatsev: `help @ [1]pallet
17:43  jsBot: [1]pallet: help: Paste the Javascript (only the portions relevant to your problem) in a pastebin (see `paste), and tell us what you expected, what else you tried and what actually happened. You might also consider reading: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/05/05/why_we_wont_help_you/
17:43  [1]pallet: it's a piece of validation and it's checking for mm/dd/yyyy I need to be dd/mm/yyyy but I'm out of my depth
17:45  gkatsev: I must say, I don't understand how it validates.
17:46  EvanR-work: how do you differentiate dd/mm from mm/dd??
17:46  gkatsev: oh, nvm I get it
17:46  EvanR-work: doesnt sound entire validatable
17:46  EvanR-work: entirely
17:46  gkatsev: EvanR-work: it seems ok on second look
17:46  gkatsev: [1]pallet: you want to compare RegExp.$1 to d.getDate and RegExp.$2 to d.getMonth
17:47  pigdude: Wes: if you are serious about JS dev, I suggest you read CLF
17:47  pigdude: Wes: *CLJ
17:48  pigdude: Wes: and use topic list to clear out spam
17:48  gkatsev: pigdude: what newsreader do you use? and how do you get rid of spam?
17:48  pigdude: Wes: there is not a better place to get an authoritative answer
17:48  pigdude: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.javascript/topics works fine for me
17:48  pigdude: and search
17:48  pigdude: gkatsev: I just browse
17:49  gkatsev: pigdude: ok
17:49  Wes: pigdude: I have been known to consult the spec when I want an authoritative answer. ;)
17:49  pigdude: Wes: some things happen outside of the ecma spec :^D
17:49  Wes: pigdude: That's true - iteration order being a fine example
17:49  pigdude: Wes: also they are absurdly familiar w/ the spec, multiple versions at that
17:50  pigdude: Wes: the only annoying thing is David Mark hyping up his stupid library
17:50  gkatsev: I just ask inimino :)
17:50  l4rk: daviiiiiiidd marrrrrk
17:50  pigdude: hehehe
17:50  pigdude: I see I am not the only one
17:56  orentanay: I have a small script that creates a set of all the A tags, then cycles through them to add an onclick event to each. The problem is that I need to ad an extra conditional to exclude the additional event assignment having specific html text. Here is my code http://pastebin.com/4aEFHqUh any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
17:58  Maxdamantus: Just add /* to the start of that code, then */ to the end.
17:59  pigdude: orentanay: if (s.indexOf(substr) != -1) { // ...
18:01  Maxdamantus: orentanay: if(domainLinks[i].firstChild.nodeType == 3 && domainLinks[i].firstChild.nodeValue == "..")
18:02  orentanay: pigdude, so s would be my links html text from my link, and substr would be the text I'm looing to match? and if so, how would you best suggest I get the value for s? thanks.
18:02 * Maxdamantus isn't sure about that nodeType being standard or anything though.
18:02  molgrew: become sure
18:03  pigdude: molgrew: sounds like a marketing line :^)
18:03  Maxdamantus: It's part of DOM level 1 apparently.
18:12  orentanay: if domainLinks[i].href gives me the href of a link of the object, what will give me it's html text the A tag is wrapped around? thanks.
18:13  Pilum: innerText | textContent
18:16  orentanay: cool, thanks Pilum

18:21  dgEAPerez: hello again... I´m creating div's on the fly inside another div (created on the fly too) but for some reason the "offsetWidth "stucks" in a value which isn´t the widest.. any help?
18:30  paxcoder: dgEAPerez, i don't understand what you mean by "widest"
18:32  dgEAPerez: paxcoder: thanks...I'va an array with elements to be "items" of a menu. texts.. In a loop for each element I create "div's", then as the texts are different in tis lenghts I expect for div´s of differente width... one of them would be the longest
18:33  dgEAPerez: for some reason, I've just a value which isnt´the logest width, ie: 94, when I know for this case must be 105...
18:33  dgEAPerez: I´m reading the property offsetWith
18:34  dgEAPerez: offsetWidth, sorry
18:34  paxcoder: dgEAPerez, did you learn how to use jsfiddler yet?
18:34  dgEAPerez: to use that I´ll have to "cut off " all the code, put a DB on some place and then "run php/js" code togheter :S
18:35  Pilate: no you wouldnt, just use whatever your current php is outputting
18:36  dgEAPerez: in other words, I know my case is "simple", just as creat a "div" object, assign a text to it and "read" the width of this div ...
18:36  dgEAPerez: (while I´ll try to do what you suggest :))
18:39  dgEAPerez: I pasted the html code and javascript in jsfiddle ... HOw I proceed now?
18:40  Pilum: You paste the resulting link here.
18:40  dgEAPerez: http://www.jsfiddle.net/x8PB7/
18:41  dgEAPerez: there is the code.. just the "relevant"...
18:42  Pilate: that is impressively bad
18:42  binni: I can execute a function like this: f1(1, 2), is it possible to pass it a "a = [1,2]" array like this f1(a) and get the same results or do I need to do f1(a[0], a[1])?
18:42  dgEAPerez: nobody born knowing :$
18:43  Pilate: binni: f1.apply(this,a)
18:43  binni: Pilate: thanks!
18:46  dgEAPerez: Pilate... inside an "if" is the original code I pretend to use... but I´m steping back to the code which works fine... sorry if my code isn´t OOP or "state of art" I´ve no time to be "perfect"... I just need to get this working to calm my boss :S
18:48  Pilate: have you considered using css
18:48  dgEAPerez: I can´t.. the "itmes" comes from a DB and never has the same width
18:48  dgEAPerez: items*
18:49  Pilate: i mean for the full page of manual styling
18:50  dgEAPerez: Aaaaaaah!... sorry.. yes.. but no right now.. when the "draft" is OK then I go to CSS
18:50  dgEAPerez: I´m using Yii, Php, CSS. HTML and JS.. all in my hand
18:51  dgEAPerez: so.. I know there is a lot of things to do
18:51  Pilate: oDivMnu.id = "menu_" + RutaNivel; oDivMnu = document.getElementById("menu_"+RutaNivel);
18:51  Pilate: sigh
18:52  dgEAPerez: Do you know?.. I was surprised when you ask for "offsetWidth" and it hasn´t a value until you assign to a objecto of the DOM
18:52  dgEAPerez: so, y append then get, then I get the value...
18:53  Teycho: why is that surprising?  if an object is not part of the structure of the DOM, then .offsetWidth is not only irrelevent, but it can't exist
18:53  dgEAPerez: so.. I need to assign it then I know the value ;)
18:54  Teycho: The value only exists after it's part of the dom

19:25  babbos: how do i convert a string to a native object? e.g. 'myobject.run' --> myobject.run ?
19:26  TheSheep: babbos: window['myobject']['run']
19:26  TheSheep: babbos: if it's global
19:27  babbos: so i have to split it...
19:27  babbos: nice
19:27  TheSheep: babbos: why not use an object from the beginning?
19:27  babbos: has to be interpreted from a textfield...
19:27  babbos: for debuging on a specific device
19:28  babbos: how would i go about since it's dynamic... maybe 2 levels down or 5 levels down... e.g. a.b.c.d.e
19:29  dbrock: is it possible to catch two-dimensional scrolling, like with Apple’s Magic Mouse?
19:29  gkatsev: there is eval but:
19:29  gkatsev: `evil
19:29  gkatsev: `eval
19:29  jsBot: eval: eval() is evil from both performance and design perspectives.  If eval() is the answer, chances are you're asking the wrong question (although there are a very few cases where it's useful) -- read http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/01/53329.aspx .  See `==== for an alternative.
19:34  peeps[lappy]: dbrock, the onscroll event should fire for both horizontal and vertical scrolling
19:35  dbrock: peeps[lappy]: and then how do you distinguish?
19:36  peeps[lappy]: you check the scrollTop and scrollLeft properties
19:39  dgEAPerez: thanksfor your time guys.. see you later :)
19:41  Gregor: `====
19:41  jsBot: ====: yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]
19:41  Gregor: ^^^ Why is this under "===="?
19:42  peeps[lappy]: `.
19:43  peeps[lappy]: dunno
19:43  gkatsev: `fubar
19:44  babbos: still, no solution to multiple / dynamic levels for objects but eval() ...
19:45  peeps[lappy]: babbos, what is wrong with splitting the string, and looping over the array?
19:45  Brown3218: what is this email address? String.Format("{0}{0}@gmail.com", "kobi")
19:45  Brown3218: String.Format("{0}{0}@gmail.com", "kobi")
19:46  babbos: will mess it up with assignments...
19:46  babbos: or not... if i use var on each loop it'll be ok...
19:46  gkatsev: deep copy the array before using it?
19:46  Brown3218: anyone?
19:47  babbos: ?!
19:47  gkatsev: babbos: kobikobi@gmail

20:17  FireFly: Sorella, have you done anything with your function preprocessor thingy yet?
20:18  Sorella: FireFly ≣ function preprocessor?
20:18  FireFly: Erm
20:18  FireFly: Preprocessing certain patterns of javascript inside functions, generating a new function from then
20:18  FireFly: them*
20:19  code30: I have a javascript that is not loading.  I can navigate to the SRC file and I can see the javascript being loaded into firebug, but it doesn't display the text as it should.  http://www.thedarkexileguild.com   The javascript is loaded in the greeetings block in the center with the following entry: <SCRIPT language="JavaScript" SRC="http://forums.thedarkexileguild.com/countdown.php?timezone=America/Los_Angeles&countto=2010-12-07 
20:19  FireFly: Like the thing that used $[foo] or something for special stuff
20:20  wkmanire: Is <?=$diff?> supposed to be some server side script?
20:20  FireFly: Looks like PHP
20:20  wkmanire: code30: Sorry, that question was aimed at you.
20:21  Pilum: code30: The language attribute was deprecated ages ago heh. Wherever your learned that is severely outdated.
20:21  code30: wkmanire, yes the javascript loads the php file that contains the actual javascript and such.  here is a working demo of the code:  http://www.minisitegallery.com/2020/
20:21  code30: Pilum, I haven't wrote new javascript in probabally 10 years
20:22  code30: Pilum, that script isn't even mine.  I just found it and tried to modify the timer
20:22  Sorella: FireFly ≣ hm, not yet. I'm not sure I was going to do a function preprocessor though, I was wondering about including some argument preprocessing/sanitization on the one I'm planning for a framework though, but haven't started writing yet because I've spent the last days trying to configure a Puppy distro to my likings.
20:22  wkmanire: code30: Take a look at this http://bit.ly/gNqDNG
20:22  FireFly: Ah, 'kay
20:22  wkmanire: Thats the same javascript except that text has been expanded to a number.
20:23  Pilum: code30: That doesn't prevent you from adjusting the HTML code to match the standards heh.
20:23  _sudo: Perform a jig for me Sorella.  I require entertainment.
20:23  wkmanire: _sudo: http://xkcd.com/149/
20:23  wkmanire: :D
20:24  _sudo: heh.  Yeah I get that alot.
20:25  FireFly: http://uni.xkcd.com/ slightly more relevant to the channel :3
20:25  wkmanire: Its one of my personal favs.
20:25  code30: wkmaire, yes that did work.  Which goes to pilum being write about the standard.  I am very much out of the loop on javscript changes.
20:25  wkmanire: ha ha ha ha. good one.
20:25  code30: lol right not write
20:26  code30: so tired
20:26  Pilum: code30: I'm not referring to javascript changes. I'm referring to the 11 year old HTML standard heh.
20:27  wkmanire: After this message, I'll be right back.

20:31  wkmanire: I'm back
20:36  Wes: whew
20:37 * ziyadb has javascript homework
20:37  code30: Pilum/wkmanire other then manually calculating the countdown do either of you have a way to correct it so that it calculates the way it was supposed to/
20:38  b1lly: when i json_encode($array) in php; how do I call the variable it in jscript?
20:38  Pilum: jscript is Microsoft's dialect of ECMAScript.
20:38  gkatsev: you want to JSON.parse it, but IE doesn't have a JSON parser, so, include json.org/json2.js
20:38  Pilum: As for parsing JSON, use JSON.parse as gkatsev said.
20:39  b1lly: and than what would the variable name be in javascript to all tho
20:39  gkatsev: whatever you want it to be?
20:40  gkatsev: var someVariableIMadeUp = JSON.parse(theJSONString);
20:42  b1lly: i get that but, when I encode it, how do I retrieve the string to parse... so if i do $blah = json_encode($array); var test = json.parse($blah) ; but blah is php    // im trying to convert a php array to json and use it in jscript
20:43  gkatsev: presumably, you'd have an XHR/AJAX request to get the json string.
20:43  b1lly: oh
20:43  LoneStar99: howdy, folks does anyone see anything wrong with this code --> http://pastebin.com/cwvED2TR
20:43  b1lly: I thought there was an easier way
20:43  LoneStar99: thanks in advance
20:43  wkmanire: LoneStar99: Please be more specific.
20:43  gkatsev: Unless you are writing the js in php, in which case, I don't think you'd need to bother with the json encoding even or something
20:43  wkmanire: code30: Are you just trying to put together a count down?
20:44  gkatsev: b1lly: I don't really know php. Also, XHR is pretty easy, especially if you use jquery for the ajax.
20:44  code30: countdown with timezone control.  I want the countdown to end at the same time for all visitors
20:44  LoneStar99: wkmanire:  i am wondering in order for it to work properly does it have to be in a function?
20:44  code30: wkmanire ^^
20:44  wkmanire: LoneStar99: Nope, you don't need a function.
20:45  wkmanire: LoneStar99: You can test your Regex as regexpal.com
20:45  LoneStar99: wkmanire: nothing seems to happen, does the syntax look correct?
20:45  wkmanire: code30: I see, just a sec. I need to do something real quick. I'll be right back.
20:45  frio801: Can someone take a look at this and tell me why my 'change' event in IE won't fire.  http://pastebin.com/u4Lzb9f6
20:45  yorick: LoneStar99: your email regex is broken
20:46  gkatsev: email regex *is* broken.
20:46  yorick: ^
20:46  NoiseEee: don't bother regexing
20:46  NoiseEee: if you're REALLY serious, have your backend make a delivery attempt
20:46  NoiseEee: either way f-em
20:46  LoneStar99: yorick:  the actuall regex it self?
20:46  code30: wkmanire, thanks.  BTW, this is the entire countdown.php script being called http://pastebin.com/wZp5K34V
20:46  NoiseEee: LoneStar99: the email spec is beyond your regex capabilities :)
20:47  LoneStar99: NoiseEee:  yeah it is...
20:47  NoiseEee: LoneStar99: its beyond just about everyone's.
20:47  yorick: http://code.google.com/p/php-email-address-validation/ <-- this is ISO-compatible email validation
20:48  yorick: http://code.google.com/p/php-email-address-validation/source/browse/trunk/EmailAddressValidator.php <-- just port this to js
20:48  LoneStar99: yorick: i am trying to avoid php for the email validator
20:48  wkmanire: code30: Looking
20:48  yorick: LoneStar99: port that to JS
20:48  yorick: LoneStar99: and how about circumventing it then
20:48 --- frio801 is now known as frio80
20:49  NoiseEee: yeah LoneStar99, if you're half-serious about email validation your backend needs to do it anyways
20:49  gkatsev: have to use server-side validation for true validation
20:49  NoiseEee: but truly, the best way is an attempted delivery to the mailbox
20:49  EvanR-work: yet again were back to the email address 'validation'
20:49  yorick: NoiseEee: that could fail on sinkhole smtp servers
20:49  EvanR-work: why bother
20:49  wkmanire: code30: I can see how it is supposed to work. Take a look at aline 127. You need to debug that and find out why $diff isn't being expanded.
20:50  wkmanire: line*
20:50  LoneStar99: noiseEee: ok will scratch javascript, i have php regex code that should work
20:50  yorick: LoneStar99: email is beyond regex
20:50  yorick: also for php
20:50  yorick: LoneStar99: http://code.google.com/p/php-email-address-validation/source/browse/trunk/EmailAddressValidator.php <-- use this...
20:50  code30: wkmanire, that I can do easier then I can debug the javascript part.  In theory if that worked would the javascript part work?
20:50  Sorella: everything is beyond php...
20:51  EvanR-work: yes
20:51  yorick: Sorella: heh
20:51  wkmanire: code30: I believe so, but I can't guarantee it.
20:51  gkatsev: even php is beyond php.
20:51  code30: thx.
20:51  EvanR-work: todays thing that is beyond php, here, is adequately handling errors in a certain framework
20:51  _sudo: you silly nooblets.  Everyone know you should do all your validation client side
20:51  EvanR-work: and transactions
20:51  LoneStar99: yeah, will use my php code
20:52  LoneStar99: thanks folks!
20:52  gkatsev: nah, all ecommerce sites should do client-side validation. That would be awesome.
20:52  _sudo: I concur.
20:52  yorick: LoneStar99: !!! not yours
20:52  NoiseEee: <input type='hidden' name='total' value='500.00' />
20:52  yorick: LoneStar99: it's broken
20:52  yorick: LoneStar99: use the one I linked
20:53  EvanR-work: lol
20:53  NoiseEee: remember the days when sites actually fucking DID THAT
20:53  gkatsev: nope
20:53  NoiseEee: I do.
20:53 * yorick is getting email addresses with spaces in it and then complain if they do not pass the validation
20:53  yorick: hah!
20:53 * gkatsev is young
20:53  peeps[lappy]: pepperidge farms remembers
20:53  Sorella: oh god
20:53  gkatsev: I'm only 21 and only got internets at home like 10 years ago
20:54  NoiseEee: funny peeps
20:54  gkatsev: and only knew about the internet like 15 years ago
20:54  _sudo: 21? you are a youngin'
20:54  EvanR-work: local policy would easily not allow spaces, for delivery to real emails, no point in validating anyway, just use the damned raw input and see what happens
20:54  EvanR-work: s/would/could/
20:54  ggt: Hi, are there some kind of cookies that don't appear in document.cookie?
20:54  frio801: Can someone take a look at this code and tell me if you can attach events in this fashion in IE?   http://pastebin.com/u4Lzb9f6
20:54  Wes: 15 years ago I was teaching people how to install trumpet winsock and launch netscape
20:55  NoiseEee: woohoo wes
20:55  NoiseEee: don't forget the good ol' JPG plugin
20:55  NoiseEee: so you can see things
20:55  gkatsev: we should just all go back to gopher://
20:55  _sudo: when I was 21 I used to have to walk 5 miles to school.  In a snowstorm.  Being chased by rabid dogs.
20:55  Wes: Downloading interleaved JPGs was always fun
20:55  Wes: "I wonder what it's gonna be!"
20:55  wkmanire: Ultimately if you're doing an e-mail-to-validate and the user doesn`t respond you'll know the address is incorrect one way or another.
20:55  code30: wkmanire, one more question do you know if <?=$diff?>; is required.  Does javascript need that format to call variables?
20:55  yorick: "-- yorick --"@my.name <-- I wonder how many sites will have this pass
20:55  NoiseEee: code30: that is php.
20:55  wkmanire: code30: That isn't javascript. You're generating a javascript with the php interpreter.
20:56  peeps[lappy]: `php
20:56  jsBot: php: You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
20:56  Wes: "HTML JavaScript"
20:56  EvanR-work: php !== js
20:56  Wes: every time I read that I get sad
20:56  code30: if i converted the php part to create variables like this:  var month = '12';  and did the content type as text/javascript would that work or do I need to do it in a .js file
20:57  EvanR-work: Wes: phjp, hypertext javascript preprocessor
20:57  wkmanire: code30: You`re going to need to get that diff variable expanded one way or another.
20:57  EvanR-work: you could make a case that it could do other things, but not before you make a case that it can even do those things
20:57  wkmanire: code30: You really aught to take this to a channel for PHP.
20:58  code30: the php side isn't my problem as much as the javascript part is.  I am not sure how javascript looks for variables.
20:58  yorick: code30: then show us JS code
20:58  elb0w: code30, what?
20:58  NoiseEee: code30: either the variables are set or they're not.
20:58  elb0w: What do you mean looks for variables lol
20:59  ggt: Why doesn't the cookie named "NID" appear in document.cookie on google.com (when doing javascript:alert(document.cookie); . According to cookie information in firefox extension  "web developer" tool that cookie should exist?) Any ideas?
20:59  MikeD_: does selectobject.value = "foo"  force the select to display the object with the first value of "foo" - or is that too ambiguous and I have to find and select the option myself?
20:59  yorick: ggt: subdomain
20:59  wkmanire: I'm going AFK. Back later.
21:00  ggt: yorick:how can we see that?
21:00  yorick: ggt: just a guess
21:00  EvanR-work: MikeD_: set the selected option to selected
21:01  frio801: In IE, can you call the apply method on document.attachEvent and pass in the element along with the arguments.  Something like document.attachEvent.apply( element, args );?  This works in FF.
21:01  ggt: yorick:the "host" and "path" info is same as other cookie that appear in document.cookie
21:01  ggt: yorick:why doesn't document.cookie show this cookie?
21:01  yorick: ggt: then no idea, sorry
21:01  MikeD_: EvanR - is there a simple way to find the option I want to select or do i have to iterate the options and compare values?
21:02  yorick: frio801: why not?
21:02  yorick: frio801: oh wait...not guaranteed to work
21:02  yorick: frio801: might be a different implementation on DocumentElement than on HTMLElement
21:02  yorick: frio801: why would you even want this
21:03  ggt: Are there other ways to list cookies used on a site without using document.cookie?
21:03  frio801: yorick: Just playing around with this: http://pastebin.com/0HKErFsp
21:04  orentanay: in this situation: .indexOf("Click here if you've forgotten your password") should I be escaping the ' in "you've" like so "you\'ve" ? thanks.
21:05  frio801: I wanted to try to write my own code to abstract attaching events and I noticed that the apply method doesn't function as I hoped.  Wanted to see if anyone can shed light on this.
21:05  yorick: frio801: ew
21:05  Sorella: orentanay ≣ no
21:05  EvanR-work: MikeD_: well, do you mean 'the first' one with that value?
21:05  yorick: frio801: is that supposed to be enterprise(c)(r) ready(tm) OOP crap?
21:05  dmsuperman: How can I define a function within a closure that is accessible outside that closure? I want it to be at the same level as the rest of the page so I can just access it like "funcName()"
21:05  frio801: frio801: No. That's me trying to learn crap.
21:06 --- perlite_ is now known as perlite
21:06  frio801: yorick: That's me trying to learn crap.
21:06  dmsuperman: However if I define it like this: (function($){ function funcName(){alert('f');} })(jQuery);  funcName only works inside the closure
21:06  yorick: frio801: a single if would work just as fine
21:06  orentanay: thanks Sorella, I was asking b/c ie6 seems to not be returning False when the situation should be returning True. Are there any known issues w/ using innerText w/ ie6? thanks.
21:07  frio801: yorick: Yes but that's not interesting.
21:07  yorick: frio801: this is not something you will ever want
21:07  Sorella: I don't think IE would have a problem with innerText. It's an MS property after all...
21:07  EvanR-work: MikeD_: for loops can encode anything, but youd do well to use functions to represent standard tasks so you dont go insane. in this case, function find(list, test){ //return the first thing that passes the test or else throw an error }
21:07  orentanay: ok, thanks.
21:07  dmsuperman: Ah, the top level is document. I need to use this: (function($){ document.funcName = function(){alert('f');} })(jQuery);
21:07  dmsuperman: Oh thanks dmsuperman
21:07  dmsuperman: No problem dmsuperman
21:08  dmsuperman: See you later dmsuperman!
21:08  EvanR-work: MikeD_: to avoid writing a lambda each time test is just 'equal to something' you can write a function eq(what){ return function(x){ return x == what; } }
21:08  yorick: frio801: to be safe, you would use getMethod: function(element) { return element.attachEvent }
21:08  EvanR-work: find(list, eq(value));
21:09  EvanR-work: or instead of ==, .value ==
21:09  frio801: yorick: ok, maybe I'm trying to make it more complicated than necessary
21:11  EvanR-work: MikeD_: someone may have suggested this already, but jquery has a search language built into it
21:11  frio801: yorick: I thought it would be an interesting test to try to write something myself to learn.  I will just look at some library code.  I assume it is not implemented this way

21:31  delac: this ( http://paste.ubuntu.com/540415/ ) piece of javascript seems to work in Opera but not in Firefox. What am I  doing wrong?
21:32  delac: the img-tag will show up in source of the page, but nothing is rendered to the page
21:32  NoiseEee: then you have a bad path to the image?
21:32  NoiseEee: that should be fine
21:33  delac: it works in Opera
21:33  delac: so it's not bad path
21:33  NoiseEee: oh right
21:33  NoiseEee: well
21:33  NoiseEee: opera is probably for some reason rendering an "image" element
21:33  NoiseEee: whereas FF is properly waiting to render a "img" element
21:34  delac: the difference?
21:34  Respected_sir: hello java masters

21:35  delac: well, there IS a difference :)
21:35  Respected_sir: I read that javascript can be used to make the webpage appear at the middle of the browser. Is that true?
21:35  delac: NoiseEee: thanks!
21:36  Pilum: Respected_sir: Java masters are found over in #java - and centering a webpage is better done in CSS.
21:36  Brown3218: Anyone?
21:37  yorick: Respected_sir: !!!
21:37  yorick: `java
21:37  gbot2: As the /topic says, this channel is *not* about Java.  Try #java
21:38  yorick: delac: the image element does not exist
21:39  peeps[lappy]: Brown3218, i don't know, did you check the API docs?
21:40  delac: yorick: both Firefox and Opera will happily create the "img" tag using createElement("image"). However only Opera will actually show the image on page.

21:57  Pilate: oh youre just one of those people who think others on irc give a shit about what device youre on
21:57  peeps[lappy]: Pilate, i don't care if you give a shit, but i can't use peepsalot, cause my desktop is still logged in
21:59  peeps[lappy]: i'm one of those people that leaves his desktop logged in to irc 24/7
21:59  Pilate: theres this sweet 80s tech called a bouncer or something that lets you use the same name and channels on any client

22:04  Brown3218: Any help anyone??? http://pastebin.com/XuBJqmX7
22:05  Pilate: its not valid bartz, theres characters that should be escaped that arent
22:05  peeps[lappy]: Bartzy|work, http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html
22:05  peeps[lappy]: read the section "Metacharacters Inside Character Classes"
22:06  Bartzy|work: Pilate: which ones ?
22:06  Bartzy|work: oh peeps thanks
22:06  peeps[lappy]: you don't have to escape any of those chars
22:06  Wes: Brown3218: You're going to have a tough time finding help of the direct nature you want -- it's as though you logged into #english and asked for help showing that The Whale was a metaphor for the wrath of God on sinners
22:06  Bartzy|work: OK so only the hyphen right ?
22:06  Bartzy|work: I think I need to escape the last one, the hyphen ?
22:06  peeps[lappy]: oh, yeah i missed that
22:07  Wes: Brown3218: i.e. even though the answer is in language of the topic, answering it really isn't, and is a much more complicated venture that requires comprehension, rather than syntatical or even semantic advice
22:07  Brown3218: Wes, isn't the placement of those 2 lines of code more a javascript thing than a google api thing?
22:07  Pilate: peeps: and () has to be escaped, but im sure youre the pro
22:08  peeps[lappy]: Pilate, not inside a character class
22:08  Wes: Brown3218: No - placement of code within an algorithm requires an understanding of the context, not the language that the algorithm is expressed in
22:08  Brown3218: ok
22:09  Wes: Brown3218: Not trying to be a downer, trying to help you understand what you don't understand.  Like I said this morning, you're learning to swim by jumping off the dock. Nothing wrong with that, but it means that your first swim is going to be a hell of a chore.

22:46  Wes: SUP, nvictor, my MAN
22:46  nvictor: if your content is dynamically generated with javascript, is there a possibility that google won't index the page?
22:47  joo: Wes, did you seriously think numbers were passed by reference?
22:47  Wes: joo: no
22:47  _sudo: nothing is passed by reference.
22:47  Sorella: nvictor ≣ if you do it on the client side, and if all the content is generated using javascript, instead of relying on actual links and static content, yes, Google won't index it.
22:47  Wes: joo: I was demonstrating that ++n could be rewritten with a closure
22:48  joo: Ah.
22:48  Wes: joo: in the stupidest way imaginable ;)
22:48  nvictor: Sorella: wow
22:48  Wes: But, doing so shows, I think, that ++n has tennant correspondence in JS
22:48  joo: Well, it could also be done like (n++, n-1) like I said
22:48  Wes: Although I'd have to pop open a book to check if upvarring is cheating
22:48  _sudo: spiders don't even run JS do they?
22:48  joo: Also I think you mean n++
22:49  Wes: joo: That has a semantic difference, although, it's unobservable, so I guess it doesn't matter much
22:49  joo: Wes, a semantic difference? Which?
22:49  ironmagma: var n=50;  x = [n++, n][0];
22:49  ironmagma: er, no :P
22:49  Wes: joo: You're revaluating the operand, rather than returning the previously stored value
22:50  Wes: And yeah, you're right about n++, jeez, long day or what
22:50  joo: Hmm
22:50  joo: I suppose
22:50  ironmagma: js> var n=50; x = [n, n=n+1][0];

22:55  systemfault: js> delete undefined;
22:55  gbot2: systemfault: false
22:55  Wes: systemfault: probably depends on your engine ATM, but older JS engines certainly allow it to be assigned a defined value
22:55  gkatsev: delete is only for object's properties
22:55  Wes: gkatsev: Yes

22:56  systemfault: Wes: It must makes debugging sessions even more fun!
22:56  Wes: systemfault: This is why I never write "a = undefined" and always write "a = void 0"  (or whatever)
22:56  gkatsev: Wes: now if only they get rid of the no var == global thing.
22:57  gkatsev: I just do a; or a = null;
22:57  Wes: gkatsev: That comes with ES5 strict mode
22:57  _sudo: TheSheep: lol chillax man.  I was just joining the gbot fun.
22:57  gkatsev: Wes: var == global?
22:57  gkatsev: !==
22:57  Wes: gkatsev: no, no-var == global
22:57  gkatsev: er, !var !== global
22:57  gkatsev: ok
22:57  Wes: gkatsev: using an undeclared var in strict code is an error
22:58  gkatsev: brendan eich warns against using strict mode
22:58  ironmagma: is there some way to define both a function like String.toLowerCase(blah); and blah.toLowerCase() at the same time?
22:58  gkatsev: well, it's more of he says use it with caution
22:58  TheSheep: gkatsev: why?
22:58  peeps[lappy]: ergh, don't feel like workin today
22:58  joo: peeps[lappy], start a fire
22:58  gkatsev: TheSheep: because if you concatinate several files, it may break how you do things because 'use strict' only works if it at the very top of the code.
22:58  joo: in your workplace
22:58  peeps[lappy]: hehe
22:59  joo: gkatsev, damn, that never occured to me
22:59  gkatsev: http://www.aminutewithbrendan.com/pages/20100913
22:59  EvanR-work: only you can prevent office fires
22:59  joo: That will break entire workflows!
22:59  gkatsev: joo: that is why brendan eich is the man.
23:00  TheSheep: gkatsev: but strict mode code will work in non-strict environment just fine
23:00  systemfault: Isn't crockford the man these days?
23:00  gkatsev: TheSheep: not exactly.
23:00  EvanR-work: ._.
23:00  Pilate: that would imply crockford was ever not the man
23:00  TheSheep: Pilate: I assume he was once the kid
23:01  EvanR-work: crockford, master chief of javascript, man i sure wish i had THAT title...
23:01  TheSheep: Pilate: and before that, the baby
23:01  gkatsev: crockford isn't as much of a man as eich is.
23:01  systemfault: EvanR-work: Just play World of Warcraft, you'll get a lot of titles.
23:01  EvanR-work: lol
23:01  joo: lol

23:29  gbot2: joo: "http://google.com/search"
23:29  Segaja: peeps[lappy]: for all browsers (>= IE7, >= FF2, and so on) and for all elements ?
23:29  joo: Figaroo: like that.
23:30  joo: Figaroo: however that will also remove a hash reference
23:30  Segaja: background-color is .style.backgroundColor? class="foo" is .class = "foo" ?
23:30  Figaroo: removing the hash is okay.
23:30  Figaroo: Thanks a lot joo. :)
23:30  Figaroo: I really need to practice regex
23:31  Figaroo: do I need to do /\?.*$/g ?
23:31  Figaroo: g for global?
23:31  peeps[lappy]: no, there is only one place it will match
23:31  Figaroo: cool.
23:32  Figaroo: What happens if there is two question marks?
23:32  Figaroo: A question mark in the hash let's say
23:32  joo: Figaroo.. oh, good point
23:33  joo: But it should choose the first one actually
23:33  joo: Does JS have a greedy modifier?
23:33  peeps[lappy]: pretty sure that would be invalid url, it should be escaped.  but the greediness and the $ should still cover that case
23:33  Figaroo: greediness?
23:33  joo: greediness = taking as much as possible
23:33  Figaroo: Oh
23:34  Figaroo: Some regex engines aren't greeding I assume?
23:34  joo: in terms of a regexp, it would take as my characters as possible when you put .*
23:34  peter2: i'm having some script errors in IE6 and i'm wonder if there is a validator tool that i can paste my url into to be checked
23:34  preaction: regexp are greedy unless told otherwise
23:34  peeps[lappy]: js> "http://google.com/search?q=how+to+kill+yourself&aq=f&aqi=&gs_rfai=#lkjflkj???lkjlkj".replace(/\?.*$/,"")
23:34  gbot2: peeps[lappy]: "http://google.com/search"
23:34  Figaroo: how do you tell them otherwise?
23:34  preaction: but if you need to change the greediness, your regexp will become inefficient and there's probably a better way to do it
23:34  joo: Figaroo with the lazy modifier, ?
23:34  joo: js> "http://google.com/search?q=how+to+kill+yourself&aq=f&aqi=&gs_rfai=#lkjflkj???lkjlkj".replace(/\?.*?/,"")
23:34  gbot2: joo: "http://google.com/searchq=how+to+kill+yourself&aq=f&aqi=&gs_rfai=#lkjflkj???lkjlkj"
23:35  joo: In that case it only takes the first char
23:35  Segaja: peeps[lappy]: ?
23:35  joo: But if you put $ at the end it would have to take all of them
23:35  peeps[lappy]: Segaja, probably
23:35  Figaroo: I thought ? was {0,n}
23:35  preaction: ? is {0,1}
23:36  Segaja: peeps[lappy]: hm..
23:36  preaction: but after another repeater changes the match to non-greedy
23:36  peeps[lappy]: Segaja, i don't know of any case where it makes a difference.  but it's possible some dumb browser has a problem with one or the other
23:36  Segaja: peeps[lappy]: afaik IE only understands .className
23:36  peeps[lappy]: maybe for some specific attribute, i doublt it though
23:37  Segaja: but i don't know if this is true or for which version
23:37  Figaroo: preaction, oh right I see.
23:38  Figaroo: so *? is like {0,}{0,1} which is like saying one or none of {0,}... That's confusing.
23:38  jwl: should I write "function(args)" or "function (args)"
23:38  jwl: i tend to choose the latter cause function is a keyword and keywords usually stand alone
23:40  FireFly: Figaroo, huh?
23:41  FireFly: the ? in *? is simply making the kleene star (*) lazy
23:41  FireFly: which means it'll try to "eat as little as possible" instead of "eat as much as possible"
23:41  FireFly: It's totally separate from the standalone ? in a regex
23:42  FireFly: which means "zero or one"
23:43  Figaroo: FireFly, I see. Thanks for making that clear. :P
23:43  FireFly: You're welcome :3
23:44  FireFly: http://www.regular-expressions.info/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex probably holds all you need to know 'bout regexes
23:44  FireFly: wikipedia keeping it more brief
23:46  Segaja: does every method call gets the event parameter?
23:46  Figaroo: Hows about http://regexpal.com?
23:46  peeps[lappy]: Segaja, IE uses window.event, which is not really a parameter
23:46  peeps[lappy]: but that would be available from any method
23:47  Segaja: ok
23:47  Segaja: and FF?
23:47  peeps[lappy]: ff passes in the event object as the first parameter to an event handler
23:47  b1lly: does this json object var look right http://pastebin.com/aNZbECyf i basically wanna be able to do orders.orderid[1].email
23:47  peeps[lappy]: you can name the parameter whatever you want in your funcion defitons
23:48  Segaja: so if i have menu_item.onMouseOver = xmenu.pullDown; than xmenu.pullDown() gets as first parmeter the event object, right?
23:52  peeps[lappy]: `events
23:52  jsBot: events: http://onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/chapter4.html   www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_events.html   www.quirksmode.org/js/events_tradmod.html
