00:10  themiddleman: so you really cant use prototypes and closures at the same time huh
00:31  svm_invictvs: WHy does the Chrome debugger look suspiciously like Xcode:?
00:31  Wes-: themiddleman: why not?
00:32  svm_invictvs: I suppose that's a better answer than, 'Because you touch yourself at night.'
00:33  themiddleman: Wes-: I guess what I mean is crockford style prototypal inheritence
00:33  Wes-: themiddleman: I try not to pay too much attention to crock :)
00:33  Wes-: themiddleman: I also don't believe in deep object hierarchies
00:36  Wes-: Wow, Opera sure is slower than everybody at DOM script-tag injection
00:36 * Wes- wonders why
00:41  oki-: hello, i have a question. element.addEventListener('click',update) overwrites itself when added multiple times. however element.addEventListener('click',function(){update(event)}) does not overwrite itself, even if i pass the same anonymous function each time. is this correct or a bug in chrome?
00:42  merAk: hello
00:42  merAk: I need help
00:43  merAk: I need help !
00:44  preaction: I need help too!
00:44  preaction: `ask
00:44  jsBot: ask: Ask your question directly, you don't need to ask permission to ask a question!  See also: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
00:44  merAk: var podloga1= document.backgroundImage = "url(poz1.jpg)"; May you help me with this? I want to name var podloga1 which will have reference to the object in css file
00:44  merAk: how to do that?
00:45  preaction: you can't. CSS and JS are completely separate
00:45  preaction: you can set CSS properties with JS, but you cannot use JS inside of CSS
00:45  merAk: thats what I want preaction
00:45  merAk: so I have css file
00:46  merAk: var podloga1="poz1.jpg" this is variable in JS file
00:46  merAk: http://pastebin.com/fSB5GjVV
00:46  buubot: merAk:  The 34 line paste fSB5GjVV has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/1135  .
00:46  merAk: I have CSS file in it and JS file
00:47  merAk: I want to have background image that will not repeat
00:47  merAk: I do not know how to do that in JS
00:47  merAk: May you help me?
00:47  preaction: `enter @ merAk
00:47  merAk: ?
00:48  preaction: merAk: don't use "Enter" as punctuation. type your entire message, use periods to seperate sentences. type complete thoughts
00:48  merAk: OK.
00:49  merAk: I really need that image be all over the web screen.
00:49  preaction: merAk: you can set CSS properties through element.style. So like: document.body.style.backgroundImage = "myimage.jpg". the other CSS property you want is probably "backgroundRepeat". note how "-" is removed from the JS version and replaced with camelCase
00:51  merAk: NO!
00:51  merAk: I want my picture not to be repearable when I call it from the JS. And also, how would I set variable in JS that will be called on CSS properties?
00:52  preaction: what is "repearable"? i have no idea what you want
00:53  merAk: Look, I do not want my image repeat on the web screen. I do not know how to do that in JS, may you help me?
00:53  preaction: you set the backgroundRepeat CSS property using JS
00:53  ilias: hey all
00:54  themiddleman: ilias: hi!
00:54  merAk: ok, I have already set it
00:54  merAk: Now, how to call my CSS property for the variables in JS?
00:55  preaction: merAk: i told you. perhaps you need to find a JS tutorial about how variables can be used in the place of literals?
00:56  ilias: I have a JS OOP question.. I have a subclass of an Array. On Firefox Array.filter( this, callback ); works fine but not on Safari. I am trying to use Array.prototype.filter( callback, this ) but it is not working at all on either browser. Anyone have a clue about this?
00:57  preaction: uh... you mean Array.filter.call( this, callback ); and Array.prototype.filter.call( this, callback ); right?
00:58  ilias: no I have never used .call
00:58  ilias: and for some reason Array.filter( this, callback ) works in that order (and only that order)
00:59  ilias: trying it with .call right now...
00:59  preaction: call() is what you want, or apply, depending on how your arguments are arranged
01:00  ilias: hmm brilliant, it works
01:00  ilias: js oop is such a mess. thanks for the tip
01:00  dguttman: What's the best way to set a value of an attribute of an object at an arbitrary depth, using an array as an input? Example of an obviously ugly/naive way of doing it: http://pastie.org/1321559
01:00  preaction: ilias: why do you need to do things this way? why can't you "myobj.filter(callback)"?
01:01  preaction: dguttman: uhm... use a loop and a variable scoped outside the loop
01:01  FireFly|n900: ilias, I think JS OOP (aka prototypal OOP) is much more beautiful than classical OOP
01:01  ilias: preaction: I should have specified I am overriding the method and want to call the superclass method from within it
01:02  FireFly|n900: First of all, there are no classes
01:02  FireFly|n900: Also, it's perfectly possible to call a function from another prototype
01:03  ilias: hmm well I am still learning the ropes. there very well may be some advantages
01:03  FireFly|n900: You can do Foo.prototype.bar.call(this, x, y)
01:03  FireFly|n900: Heh
01:03  FireFly|n900: If you haven't checked it out, eloquentjavascript is a great introduction to JS
01:03  FireFly|n900: `eloquent
01:03  jsBot: eloquent: Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter.  http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
01:03  FireFly|n900: Also
01:03  FireFly|n900: `classes
01:03  jsBot: classes: There are *no* 'classes' in Javascript.  Javascript uses prototypical OO: objects are constructed directly, based on other objects, without a blueprint.  Thinking of constructor functions as classes is *wrong,* and will confuse you in the long term.
01:04  FireFly|n900: Anyway, I'm off to bed
01:04  FireFly|n900: Have fun with JS, ilias
01:04  ilias: great, good to know, good night
01:05  csmrfx: You *can* implement class system with JS
01:05  csmrfx: but... why would you want to!
01:05  dguttman: preaction: i think i know what you're saying... I'll take a shot
01:05  FireFly|n900: Yeah
01:06  FireFly|n900: Joose is pretty cool.. does classes, interfaces, traits, mixins, and something else
01:06  FireFly|n900: Not that I *know* all those inheritance paradigms, but.. yeah
01:06  csmrfx: why you need classes with mixins?
01:06  preaction: roles, method modifiers, attributes
01:06  csmrfx: durr
01:07  preaction: Joose is Perl's Moose ported to JS
01:07  FireFly|n900: Ah, yeah
01:07  locsmif: Hi all. When a JavaScript does i = new Image(); and then does i.src = url ... does this mean the image is loaded, but does not show up in the DOM source?
01:07  FireFly|n900: csmrfx, 'cause it's nice to be able to choose?
01:07  csmrfx: well, some things, the simple ones, just work better, easier, faster?
01:07  FireFly|n900: locsmif, yep, you'd need to add it to the DOM
01:07  FireFly|n900: If you want it to show
01:08  preaction: locsmif: the image will be downloaded, yes, but there is no HTMLElement added to the DOM
01:08  FireFly|n900: I'm apparently bad at sleeping
01:08  FireFly|n900: bleh
01:08  FireFly|n900: Stop being interesting, ##js
01:08  locsmif: FireFly|n900, great, so I'm analyzing this ad script, and apparently it's passing stuff in a GET request with query parameters to a php script that returns a beacon image...
01:08  csmrfx: Have you spotted a "slideshow" thingie anywhere that would display images, videos or embed's on a page?
01:09  locsmif: FireFly|n900, pretty sneaky ...
01:09  csmrfx: Or even "harvest" these media types from a target url and display em with coolness?
01:09  FireFly|n900: locsmif, heh..
01:09  locsmif: Learning this shit makes me terrified of ad scripts...
01:10  csmrfx: Im thinkin' I'm going to make a 'slide-show' plugin that shows images, youtube videos, whatnot, unless there already is something like that
01:10  locsmif: But, I guess XHR is equally invisible in DOM unless you do something with it
01:10  csmrfx: locsmif: noscript is peace
01:11  merAk: I have tried this one, preaction, document.write('body {background-image: url('+podloga+'); background-repeat: no-repeat;}') ! But now I get an error.
01:11  merAk: Can I use CSS inside document.write(...) ?
01:11  fatbrain: `document.write
01:11  jsBot: document.write: document.wrong. Please use something more modern and less prone to doing confusing things. Have a look at `html2dom and use that to turn the HTML you wish to output into modern DOM calls.
01:11  preaction: merAk: why are you not doing it how i told you to?
01:12  merAk: Because, I do not get it what you told me
01:13  locsmif: csmrfx, absolutely.. it's just that some newspaper sites now have photo slideshows that are initiated by a flash object that must be loaded first, and the flash object displays what can only be described as an obnoxious TV ad... ;-)
01:14  merAk: I know it would be much easier to get it document.write('<BODY BACKGROUND="'+podloga+'>') But I need no-repeat attribute.
01:14  merAk: and that I can't find in HTML
01:14  locsmif: Of course, the flash object is stored on a path that contains *ad*, so ABP cuts it off, leaving with the choice to either view the ad and the slideshow or neither, LOL
01:14  merAk: actually I want that image spreads across entire web page.
01:15  dario: arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrg
01:15  merAk: Come on!
01:15  dario: :(
01:15  csmrfx: Yeah also timing the display of embeds will be interesting
01:15  csmrfx: But maybe it can be mined somehow for youtube at least
01:15  locsmif: That said, the slideshow can be 'stolen' with a GreaseMonkey script that scans the XML with the slides and the links in it, so maybe I'll get to writing a GM script one of these days, as a means to still get the full experience without the harassment. Ha ha.
01:16  dario: im trying to change an img src with JS on click but it goes back to the original every time
01:16  dario: !!
01:16  locsmif: FireFly|n900, preaction, thanks a mil for the reply
01:20  joeytwiddle: merAk: document.body.style.css_property = css_value;
01:21  dario: does someone want to ... MEND my broken wings? :(
01:21  dario: it's such a simple issue, im sure, but i can't see it. im blind and not logically inclined.
01:22  joeytwiddle: merAk: except instead of background-image= you must do .style.backgroundImage=
01:23  joeytwiddle: dario: pastebin us the broken code
01:24  dario: joeytwiddle, weeeee. one sec
01:26  dario: http://www.pastebin.ca/2000486        unfortunately, all of the code is tied together otherwise it's hard to make sense... the problem at the moment is that link at the bottom <a href=
01:26  buubot: dario:  The 97 line paste 2000486 has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/1136  .
01:26  dario: cos it's supposed to call the function to replace the source of the image
01:27  dario: and it does, but for like half a sec then returns to original state!
01:27  cheney: dario: what is your error messaging?
01:29  cheney: also, dario, you only need one var keyword for all those variables at the top of your script where each variable can be separated by a comma and the last variable is terminated with a semicolon
01:30  dario: ohhh, ok. i can tidy that up then. :)
01:31  dario: just says.. syntax error in line 6
01:32  dario: ugh... all this cos i think making my own image gallery is better than downloading something i dont really like
01:32  cheney: hummmm, pastebin's externally facing API appears to be broken right now
01:32  dario: yeah, i got bad gateway when i went into pastebin.com
01:34  cheney: dario: is it a JavaScript error in something Chrome shell or Firebug or is it a PHP error?
01:36  dario: cheney: no errors actually
01:36  dario: those were old errors
01:37  dario: when i click then link it changes the image for a second and then goes back to original
01:39  cheney: some minor areas for improvement are to never use document.write.  It is inefficient.

01:56  dguttman: preaction: http://pastie.org/1321668 is how I would up doing it
01:57  preaction: dguttman: looks a lot better than the first thing you had. though the names of the vars don't make sense out of context
01:58  dguttman: preaction: that they don't, but figured you'd be curious how it turned out
02:03  dshap: hey, can anyone read this?  i'm on an airplane any though that the IRC port might be blocked or something
02:03  dario: can js arrays handle strings to identify them? like ARRAY[MAN]=John; ARRAY[WOMAN]=Jane
02:03  Pilate: thats called an object
02:04  dario: dshap: you're on an aeroplane on irc?
02:04  dshap: dario: yea, free wi-fi on this Delta flight, sponsored by Google
02:05  dario: you're on the internet... while sitting on a chair, in the sky... flying at hundreds of KM per hour... and you're complaning about ports being blocked?
02:05  dario: :p
02:05  dario: you should be like "THIS IS A MIRACLE!!!!!!!"
02:05  dshap: dario: i'm not complaining about anything, i just didn't see any chats immediately after i logged into the channel so i wanted to confirm that it's working.  and it is.  i am happy.  i also have a javascript-related question that i will ask in the near future
02:06  dario: i was trying to make a joke, yo!
02:06  dario: :D
02:06  dshap: dario: i will complain if my macbook pro doesn't last the 6+ hours that apple says it can last on a full charge though
02:06  dario: so Pilate, that means that objects can handle that?
02:06  dshap: dario: and it's definitely not going to last that lol, i can already tell
02:07  dario: they never do... i put mine on inverted colours. like ctrl+option+command+8
02:07  dario: cos it needs less battery to create black
02:07  dario: + low brightness
02:09  dario: how can i get the key of an object?
02:09  Wes-: dshap: did you go through the naked scanner?
02:09  dshap: Wes-: no haha i was not selected for that
02:10  Wes-: dario: I suspect the battery to create black vs. white is practically unmeasureable - but brightness is a big deal
02:13  joeytwiddle: dario: to loop through the keys/properties of an object, do for (var key in obj) {
02:14  Teratogen: how do I get the javascript version?
02:14  joeytwiddle: you can also check obj.hasOwnProperty(key) i think to avoid inherited properties
02:15  dario: actually, i found another way around it grabbing the key off the php object
02:15  Teratogen: if I go to an airport to fly and I am asked to be patted down I am going to say "no don't worry about that" and take all of my clothes off.
02:15  Teratogen: I will be an instant celebrity!
02:15  dario: so i solved the most complicated stuff... now the simplest thing
02:16  dario: if i do onClick and change the src of an image it only changes for a fraction of a second
02:16  dario: if i do onmouseover it changes permanently...
02:16  dario: question: what's up with that??! how do i use click to change the pic permanent
02:19  dshap: if you guys are going to asynchronously load data from a server script and then display it on the page, do you generally prefer to load raw data into JS objects and generate the HTML client-side, or do you generate the HTML server-side and simply render what you load?
02:19 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
02:19  csmrfx: yes
02:19  dario: yikes, dshap... you have real questions.. i just want to make my lil picture gallery work! but onClick doesn't work
02:20  dshap: what do you mean it doesn't work
02:20  csmrfx: dario just go jQuery
02:20  dshap: yea i was going to say - i never don't use jQuery these days
02:20  dshap: for all of my javascripty needs
02:20  dshap: dario: was there something wrong with my question?
02:21  dario: :|
02:25  dario: <a href="" onClick="nextpix(whichpic++);"> that calls a function that changes the src of a picture. but the picture goes back to the original picture after half a sec. Almost like im just using onmousedown. Why would that be? how cna i mage it permanent?
02:27  dshap: dario: do u have an example we can see
02:30  Pilate: use events, not inline js, itll save you a bunch of hassle
02:33  cheney: JSLint advises against the use of HTML events, why would that be?
02:34  cheney: i am under the impression that HTML events are better for accessibility than surprise interactions from script initialized onload
02:36  themiddleman: cheney: why would they be better for accessibility?
02:37  cheney: because then a screen reader can prompt the user of an impending event execution prior to the execution of that event
02:38  themiddleman: no screen reader does this
02:38  themiddleman: not popular anyway
02:38  cheney: screen readers can certainly read HTML tag attributes
02:38  themiddleman: it sees a link ans assumes when it clicks it something interesting will happen
02:39  cheney: right, but what about a div or any other element that does not have a naturally embedded click interaction
02:39  themiddleman: they arent focusable and putting a click handler on them will break accessibility
02:40  themiddleman: unless theres is an alternate way of doing that action
02:40  cheney: actually, each element is focusable in a text reader
02:41  cheney: a text reader moves up and down a page
02:41  cheney: typically the elements that allow special navigation in this regard to text readers are heading elements: h1 - h6
02:42  themiddleman: but accessibility is not just screen readers, it is also people without a mouse
02:42  cheney: correct, and people with mobility disorders
02:43  themiddleman: so dont use click handlers on unfocusable elements unless you have another way to do that action
02:44  themiddleman: as for inline handlers I dont think they help anyone
02:44  cheney: so what is wrong with an onclick to a div that impacts a div further down the page?
02:45  themiddleman: you cant tab to it and press enter
02:46  cheney: themiddleman: only if using only a keyboard and only a standard browser
02:47  themiddleman: uh huh
02:47  dario: dshap: http://darioayalaphoto.com/new/
02:47  dario: the next/previous buttons only work if it's on mouseover
02:48  dario: if i put on click, they don't work. it changes pic then immediately changes back to original
02:49  cheney: i would rather tend to the needs of the vision impaired even if in conflict to users who fear the use of a mouse without need for some sort of assistive application
02:50  themiddleman: why not just tend to both

03:03  themiddleman: default
03:06  examancer: I'm using prototype. usually I do $("someElement").innerHTML="new content"; and it always works. However, now I have a <tbody> and I'm trying to inject rows using $("tbodyId").innerHTML = "<tr><td>some stuff</td></tr>"; ... this works in all browsers except IE, where I get an "unspecified" error
03:06  examancer: any ideas? is there a different/better/more-correct way to inject rows into a <tbody>?
03:12  joo: examancer, perhaps #prototype
03:13  examancer: I asked there. Waiting on response. Might try to do it without the prototype shorthand.
03:13  examancer: $() is just shorthand for Document.getElementById()
03:19  Maxdamantus: examancer: no.
03:19  examancer: ?
03:19  Maxdamantus: Calling $() implies that $ is a function.
03:19  csmrfx: dario yes you are, unless you use jQuery, or really get much better at understanding JS
03:19  Maxdamantus: $ is just an identifier, that may or may not have been defined, and it can be defined by the programmer.
03:20  Maxdamantus: js> function $(x){ return x * 2; } $(42)
03:20  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 84
03:20  examancer: right, $() in the example above is a function that I use merely as a shorthand for Document.getElementById()
03:20  examancer: having it named $ is arbitrary and can be changed, and technically the prototype function which defaults to that name does a little more than getElementById() does
03:20  Maxdamantus: Oh.
03:22  examancer: i think i need to use the insertRow() method on the <tbody> element. the question is then how do I clear out the table? right now I take a JSON dataset and rebuild the table every time. I need to empty the table out before re-inserting rows
03:22  Maxdamantus: Hmm..
03:22  examancer: just replacing the innerHTML doesn't work in IE
03:23  Maxdamantus: Can you modify it using DOM, not innerHTML?
03:24  Maxdamantus: (innerHTML is not standardised at all until HTML5, so might have odd behaviours in different browsers)
03:24  examancer: i can, using insertRow()... now I need a simple way to remove all existing rows first
03:25  examancer: hmmm... i can just create a new tbody maybe and replace it
03:26  examancer: didn't realize innerHTML was HTML5... I've been using it for years
03:27  Maxdamantus: It was added to HTML5 because people have been using it for years.
03:27  examancer: lol
03:27  examancer: that makes ense
03:27  examancer: *sense
03:28 * Maxdamantus disagrees.
03:29  examancer: I never felt comfortable using innerHTML really. definitely a hack. just easier for me then using proper DOM
03:29  examancer: javascript isn't my strength
03:30  Maxdamantus: I wonder if you've got many XSS exploits on your sites.
03:31  examancer: i know one of my sites is vulnerable to XSS but no one uses it :-P
03:32  Maxdamantus: There's .deleteRow btw
03:32  examancer: the one people actually use is partially vulnerable, but I do some cleansing server side and even if malicious script got through it would only be visible to users who logged in with the same username/password as the attacker, which doesn't make sense
03:33  examancer: yeah, i was just hoping i didn't have to do a for loop and cleans the table first
03:33  examancer: *clense
03:33  Maxdamantus: You can make a function that does the for loop for you.
03:34  examancer: i'm just being lazy :-P wanted to get away with changing as little code as possible to fix the bug
03:38  tprice: hey i wanted to know what the best way to do prototype is. tke a look at this and let me know(comments in code) https://gist.github.com/712997
03:39  Maxdamantus: I'm not sure if you can do it like the latter.
03:40  Maxdamantus: Anyway, no need for the wrapping function: boo.prototype = { uoo: function.., too: functon.. }
03:41  Maxdamantus: (But I'm not sure if you can assign the Function.prototype property.
03:41  Maxdamantus: )
03:42  tprice: would it not come up as __proto__?
03:42  Maxdamantus: __proto__ is non-standard.
03:42  tprice: can you highjack prototype? like to toString?
03:42  Maxdamantus: What do you mean?
03:43  Maxdamantus: Hm, yeah, it looks like it can be assigned.
03:43  tprice: when i do boo.prototype = {}
03:44  tprice: oh wait would that not be prototype for boo
03:44  Maxdamantus: What's that got to do with toString?
03:45  tprice: you see i dont trully undersdtand but prototype boo.prototype = {} would only affect boo and not for the method toString
03:45  tprice: i think
03:46  Maxdamantus: ...
03:46  Maxdamantus: Method toString of what?
03:49  tprice: maybe toString is a back example to pick but if i did boo.prototype = {} it would over die all methods on boo
03:50  tprice: why would i want to use prototype is it faster?
03:54  jkatana: http://jsfiddle.net/8Tgct/1/
03:54  jkatana: I'm more or less trying to avoid the constructor syntax.. is it possible?
03:57  tprice: i like that Object.create
03:58  jkatana: tprice: I prefer it to making a function an object, which still doesn't work in my mind
03:58  jkatana: the array thing is screwing me up though
04:10  Maxdamantus: jkatana: .kills will refer to the same array for every object that has its prototype wizard.
04:11  jkatana: Maxdamantus yeah, I got that much, but I don't understand why
04:11  jkatana: or why spells doesn't work the same way
04:11  Maxdamantus: spells does work the same way.
04:11  Maxdamantus: spells is a string though, so it's immutable, so it's irrelevant.
04:12  jkatana: is there anyway to achieve what I'm trying to do?
04:12  jkatana: basically turn the object literal into the same thing as new wizard();
04:12  jkatana: without a constructor
04:12  Maxdamantus: When you do `voldemort.spell = ..`, you're not modifying anything except voldemort
04:13  Maxdamantus: When you do `voldemort.kills.push(..)`, you're modifying voldemort.kills which is wizard.kills
04:13  jkatana: is there anyway to just modify voldemort.kills?
04:13  Maxdamantus: Consider: var a, b; a = []; b = a;
04:14  Maxdamantus: You are just modifying voldemort.kills, you just seem to be unsure what that means.
04:14  Maxdamantus: Use a constructor function to create a .kills property for each object.
04:14  Maxdamantus: afk
04:17  trifler: Hello, I want to try learn som basic javascript and I though I would start with hiding and showing an element. But I can't figure out how to create a function that doesn't take a specific id to show/hide. This is what I have thus far http://pastie.org/1321862. Any ideas?
04:18  jkatana: trifler: you're attempting to use #jquery I think
04:19  freedrull: can i modify the text of a textfield in a form with an id but no name? document.getElementById(myform).mytextfield.value += 'hello'; doesnt seem to work
04:19  jkatana: you're probably better off learning basic javascript first, then work on animations based off a js framework
04:19  trifler: jkatana: Well yes I use a jquery/ajax thingy for the actual hiding showing. It's the argument that gets passed to the function and later "extracted" Im wondering about.
04:20  freedrull: all the examples ive gotten to work, use a form with a name, and use the name to access it
04:20  jkatana: your code should call foo, but you shouldn't have your JS in your html like that
04:20  jkatana: it should be seperated
04:20  jkatana: separated*
04:20  trifler: jkatana: The text below //script file is in a seprate file.
04:21  trifler: so is the text above it.
04:21  jkatana: I know, I mean 'onclick' is bad to have in html
04:21  jkatana: for jquery at least, in your js you should define the click handler with $('#id').click(function() { });
04:23  csmrfx: I say, use jQuery first while watching as many Crockford and JS videos as possible
04:23  csmrfx: ^trifler
04:24  csmrfx: once the syntax & broader concepts are clear, dig into the lisp side of JS
04:27  Maxdamantus: csmrfx: how long until the syntax is clear?
04:27  Maxdamantus: imo videos aren't a good way to learn languages.
04:27  Maxdamantus: or at least programming languages.

04:34  BlehTM2: Is a Scripting.FileSystemObject usually created once at the beginning of the code, or do you remake it for every task and have the scope be limited to a function?
04:34  armence: Hello all. What is the XML DOM equivalent of innerHTML?
04:44  Maxdamantus: armence: there is none.
04:44  Maxdamantus: armence: innerHTML isn't part of DOM.
04:45  armence: Woot!
04:45  Maxdamantus: and I think HTML5 says that innerHTML need not be implemented for XML documents
04:45  Maxdamantus: not sure though
04:46  Maxdamantus: In the case of XML documents, will throw an INVALID_STATE_ERR if the Document cannot be serialized to XML, and a SYNTAX_ERR if the given string is not well-formed.
04:47  Maxdamantus: Hm. "cannot be serialized to XML"
04:50  csmrfx: Maxdamantus: depends on the learning person
04:51  csmrfx: Maxdamantus: your opinion is not relevant. Videos are an excellent way to participate on a lecture you'd otherwise never be able to see (Say, Mr Crockford's).
04:51  Maxdamantus: Maybe, if you practise what's discussed aswell.
04:52  Maxdamantus: Usually you'll have assignments that go along with the lectures, which is where most of the actual learning should come from.
04:52  Maxdamantus: Lectures are a way of expressing ideas.

07:09  Arimil: what would be an easy way to pull http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xrU5BxaPWo out of this url?
07:09  Arimil: the url may have other variables behind it, I would also like to keep them intact
07:10  Arimil: for example http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567?fs=1
07:10  Arimil: I would like fs=1 to remain
07:11  Arimil: I've been trying to use regexp to pull everything after the first = sign but I can't seem to figure it out :\
07:12  pigdude: Gregor: these were my thoughts exactly
07:14  pigdude: Arimil: what are you trying to find in what?
07:14  gkatsev: js> "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567?fs=1".split('?').slice(1);
07:14  gbot2: gkatsev: ["v=1234567","fs=1"]
07:14  gkatsev: Arimil: ^
07:14  Arimil: 0.o
07:14  Arimil: thanks
07:18  Arimil: :\ only problem is, I don't need v= but don't tell me I think I can figure it out
07:18  joo: The URL wouldn't look like that though..
07:18  joo: It would be ?v=23432432&fs=1 pr ?v=23432432;fs=1
07:18  joo: *or
07:19  joo: And there may be other details I've missed, so it's best to look up the spec for URL
07:19  gkatsev: js> "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1".split('?')[1].split('&');
07:19  gbot2: gkatsev: ["v=1234567","fs=1"]
07:19  gkatsev: joo: yes, should be like that
07:20  joo: "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1".split('?')[1].split(/[&:]/)
07:20  joo: rather
07:20  joo: I suppose you could get away with the assuption that ; wouldn't be used
07:20  joo: But why risk it?
07:20  joo: Oh that should be a ;
07:20  joo: not a :
07:20  gkatsev: yeah, I guess
07:21  gkatsev: &|; saves one char :P
07:21  gkatsev: js> "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1;foo=bar".split('?')[1].split(/&|;/);
07:21  gbot2: gkatsev: ["v=1234567","fs=1","foo=bar"]
07:22  joo: Heh. Yes.
07:22  joo: I somehow thought that [&;] would be more efficient, but that's probably unfounded
07:22  Arimil: Youtube embed parameters don't work in the url anyway :p
07:23  Arimil: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xrU5BxaPWo&fs=0&autoplay=0 changes nothing
07:23  joo: So it's best to parse it with complete knowledge of the URL format, producing a map from names to values
07:23  joo: And then get the parameters you want
07:24  Arimil: however I'm trying to make an easy way for people to embed the video and some of the people on our forums are dumb so I would like it to work if they simply copy-paste the url
07:24  Arimil: but for the more advanced users I wouldn't like to remove any functionaly of the embed parameters
07:24  Arimil: however your right ? was bad & is better
07:25  joo: Well then after modifying the parameters, reconstruct the URL
07:25  Arimil: yeah the embed works like http://www.youtube.com/v/7xrU5BxaPWo?autoplay=1
07:25  Arimil: so I need to split the video id and then everything after the ? into two different variables
07:26  Arimil: or well, that's not the url they will use
07:26  Arimil: so split the video id and everything after the &
07:34  Arimil: hm, doing
07:34  Arimil: js> "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('=', 1)
07:34  gbot2: Arimil: ["http://youtube.com/watch?v"]
07:34  Arimil: shouldn't it have two variables in the array?
07:34  Arimil: the other containing 1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1
07:34  gkatsev: remove the limit
07:35  gkatsev: js> "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('=')
07:35  gbot2: gkatsev: ["http://youtube.com/watch?v","1234567&fs","1&autoplay","1"]
07:35  Arimil: then it splits fs= etc
07:35  Arimil: which I don't want split
07:35  gkatsev: what exactly do you want? the id and the vars?
07:35  Arimil: yeah
07:35  gkatsev: is this the format?  "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1"
07:36  Arimil: I want 1234567 and &fs=1&autoplay=1
07:36  Arimil: yup
07:37  gkatsev: js>  "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('?')[1]
07:37  gbot2: gkatsev: "v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1"
07:37  gkatsev: js>  "http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('?')[1].split('&')

07:38  gkatsev: js>  var a ="http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('?')[1].split('&'); a[0] = a[0].split('=')[1]; a;
07:38  gbot2: gkatsev: ["1234567","fs=1","autoplay=1"]
07:38  Arimil: :\ I don't want the vars split though
07:39  Arimil: ["1234567", "&fs=1&autoplay=1"]
07:39  Arimil: is desired result
07:40  gkatsev: js>  var a ="http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('?')[1].split('&'); var b = []; b[0] = a[0].split('=')[1]; b[1] = a[1]+'&'+a[2]
07:40  gbot2: gkatsev: "fs=1&autoplay=1"
07:40  gkatsev: js>  var a ="http://youtube.com/watch?v=1234567&fs=1&autoplay=1".split('?')[1].split('&'); var b = []; b[0] = a[0].split('=')[1]; b[1] = a[1]+'&'+a[2]; b
07:40  gbot2: gkatsev: ["1234567","fs=1&autoplay=1"]
07:40  Arimil: wow lol
07:40  Arimil: thanks, that was a pain
07:40  gkatsev: does it really matter if the vars are together or not?
07:40  gkatsev: i'm sure there are better ways.
07:41  gkatsev: I know there are libs to do this as well
07:41  Arimil: it's easiest for me if they are together so I can just include one variable for the vars
07:41  Arimil: I'll throw up an example of what I'm doing if you want
07:41  gkatsev: why not just keep in an array? or turn it into an object?
07:42  Arimil: second
07:43  Arimil: http://jsfiddle.net/Nbzqb/
07:44  Arimil: if (/youtube/i.test("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xrU5BxaPWo"))
07:44  Arimil: will be replaced with their url
07:44  Arimil: so if I split that into the id, and the vars I can just add them to the embed

07:46  Arimil: hm wouldn't indexOf not change anything though? thats still a function call lol
07:47  Arimil: unless regexp counts as a function?
07:47  gkatsev: no, the .test is a function
07:47  pigdude: v8: String.prototype.isYoutube = function() { return this.toLowerCase().indexOf('youtube') > -1; }; 'www.youtube.com'.isYoutube();
07:47  v8bot: pigdude: true
07:47  Arimil: and .indexOf isn't?
07:47  pigdude: Arimil: there ya go :^D
07:48  gkatsev: lol
07:48  pigdude: that is BEST PRACTICE
07:48  gkatsev: what? modifying the global string prototype?
07:48  pigdude: Arimil: please do not take this seriously
07:48  pigdude: Arimil: this is for entertainment purposes only
07:48  Arimil: lol

07:51  pigdude: gkatsev: do not touch Object.prototype
07:51  gkatsev: lol, just because you can :P
07:51  pigdude: gkatsev: and an instanceof check is stupid
07:51  pigdude: gkatsev: why do that when you can just augment the prototype
07:51  gkatsev: yeah, probably uneeded
07:51  Arimil: gkatsev: :\ your code won't work
07:51  gkatsev: which code?

07:51  gbot2: Arimil: ["1234567","fs=1&autoplay=1"]
07:52  Arimil: if there was a third var, it wouldn't work
07:52  gkatsev: add a & before the second one/
07:52  gkatsev: ?
07:53  Arimil: everything after & there could be 0 of them, there could be 9 of them
07:54  gkatsev: ah, yes

09:02  zomg: teslan: you could have your buddy add a page on his site which has nothing but an iframe to your page
09:02  zomg: then it won't show it's on your page, but I fail to see the reason you'd need to do that for any legitimate purpose
09:06  teslan: zomg, because i created a youtube player that plays a playlist from couchdb, which he maintains but i do not want to have to keep installing my site on his and actually possibly other such sites ... so, can i wrap an iframe around an href ?
09:06  teslan: my player*
09:06  zomg: <iframe src="http://www.whatever.com"></iframe>
09:07  teslan: cool and thanks a million
09:07  zomg: np
09:08  Tasser: what's out there to format some one-line JS code?
09:08  teslan: now that you have commented about not seeing a ligit reason, is there perhaps a better approach to alll of this ... what if some day i end up with dozens of piddly little sites that want to do the same thing ... is iframe an ideal way of "embedding" my player or is there a better approach but one in which the actual player.swf file reside on my server for both deployment and security reasons
09:08  teslan: a right reason*
09:11  zomg: teslan: well if it's a swf, the object/embed tag you use can actually be linked from the other server
09:11  zomg: just look at how youtube does it for example
09:15  HackeMate: hello
09:16  HackeMate: i have a page running a cgi, i use document.ready to show in a div what the cgi returns, the cgi restarts a service in the local machine so it gets freezy for a few seconds
09:16  HackeMate: i wanted to know if there is an alternative than .ready to see what happen
09:16  HackeMate: like .loading or something like that
09:18  teslan: zomg, i think you are right , so i need to look at all of the cross site implications as that is what i tried first and all i got was a blank blak player ... in the meanwhile, i am in editor of his page and it has that <a href=http ... <img src ...other stuf ...></a> ... how do i implent 'iframe' into that ?
09:20  teslan: now that i learned adobe flex, i should learn darn html and stop hoping it will go by
09:23  teslan: oh my lord ... instead of my player.swf opening in it's own iframe page, i have it opening in place of the image on which one is to click to get to the iframed page ... come on guys, help out this ooooooold school noob ;)
09:24  zomg: You should probably change the link the <a> is pointing to a new page which has the iframe in it
09:25  teslan: i replace <a with <iframe then /a with /frame and got this ;)
09:27  teslan: ah let me see if i got it conceptually ... instead of tryin to tell <a that href needs to bee opened up in its own iframe, i should have it go to a separate html page and which would have nothing in it, except the iframe
09:30  zomg: At least it sounds like you want it to still have the link to the player, so that would probably be what you should do
09:30  zomg: Although I must say it has very little to do with javascript
09:30  zomg: =)
09:34 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
09:38  teslan: zomg: i apologize it's just that i have been coming here for js answers and this was my first hml forey, so no more, i will look for an html irc ... thanks a million for your help ... regarding the player there is heeps of cross domain issues that youtube enforces ... thanks again

13:30  amcsi: if variable "xml" doesn't have a property called "query", then why does this evaluate to false in ie? var xmlExt = xml.query ? xml : Ext.get(xml);
13:30  Cork: try xml.query == undefined
13:32  spetrea: cojack: thanks, in the meantime I also found out how
13:35  amcsi: this is very bad. I'm using if(object.property) almost everywhere. IE seriously does the exact opposite?
13:36  ivan`_: what does typeof xml.query say?
13:36  ivan`_: IE sometimes uses object proxies
13:41  amcsi: alert says: undefined
13:42  Cork: amcsi: undefined doesn't always evaluate to false
13:42  Cork: at least thats my findings
13:42  Cork: so explicitly checking key == undefined
13:42  Cork: is alot saifer
13:42  Cork: or if you care for it to allow null key === undefined

13:46  Cork: else you should add it a sap
13:46  krambiorix: Cork, i added it, but still
13:47  amcsi: I heard typeof(varName == "undefined") is better, cuz undefined is a global var

15:47  Hishi[Revo]: frimend are you talking about using Javascript from an external file? ifso you can use <script src="Url to external js file" type="text/javascript"></script
15:48  Hishi[Revo]: ops forgot the > at the end of script
15:50  ironmagma: Is there a way to somehow get javascript's internal representation of a variable (so you can know what you're doing before you start doing bitwise functions on it)?
15:50  ivan`_: no
15:52  Elvanor: I am loading scripts by dynamically creatinh <script> elements, and it seems to me the browser (at least FF) forces the load of these scripts in the order they were created
15:52  Elvanor: Even if the code from the second script is returned first by the server
15:53  ivan`_: of course
15:54  ivan`_: if you want other behavior, see <script defer and/or <script async
15:54  Elvanor: ivan`_: thx
15:54  Elvanor: But these are HTML 5 right?
15:54  ivan`_: yes
15:54  ivan`_: you want scripts to be executed out of order as soon as possible?
15:54  Elvanor: OK so in HTML 4 I am stuck with a request queue. I really needed to know that :)
15:55  Elvanor: ivan`_: yes
15:55  Elvanor: in certain cases
15:55  ivan`_: I guess you can pull them with XHR
15:55  Elvanor: Because those scripts are actually the results of server calls
15:55  todd: defer works as far back as ie6
15:55  Elvanor: so the server can take a long time for some of them, and some will be quick
15:55  Elvanor: ivan`_: XHR ?
15:56  todd: as a matter of fact it's a fix for a certain ie6 bug where if you try to modify the dom prior to the closing tag of an element loading ie6 fails to load the page at all
15:56  Elvanor: todd: this also works in other browsers?
15:56  ivan`_: XMLHttpRequest, but I guess if you're doing JSONP you don't want that
15:56  todd: To my knowledge yes.
15:56  Elvanor: ivan`_: yeah I cant use that
15:56  ironmagma: Why is ~1 = −2? why isn't 1 stored as "00000001"?
15:56  todd: <script defer="defer"
15:56  ivan`_: does defer do what he wants?
15:56  ivan`_: ironmagma: every number is an IEEE double, bit operators truncate to 32-bit
15:57  Maxdamantus: ironmagma: because it's two's complement.
15:57  Elvanor: ivan`_: Not sure, but I will have to have a look
15:57  todd: Well I've only used it in the context of an ie6 bug (working for a newspaper company sucks), but IIRC it defers loading the JS until the page is completely loaded.
15:57  todd: So obviously document.write is out.
15:57  todd: But seems like he could make it do what he wants.
15:57  ironmagma: ivan`_: where should I look to read about how doubles are represented internally?
15:58  Maxdamantus: ironmagma: the standard. They are IEE-754 doubles.
15:58  Maxdamantus: ECMAScript
15:58  ivan`_: http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/
15:59  Maxdamantus: Well, technically they only need to operate like IEE-754 doubles do.
15:59  Maxdamantus: There's no implication on how they're actually represented.
15:59  Maxdamantus: Bleh, IEEE*
16:01  Maxdamantus: js> ~0
16:01  gbot2: Maxdamantus: -1
16:01  Maxdamantus: js> ~(-0)
16:01  gbot2: Maxdamantus: -1
16:01  Maxdamantus: ironmagma: the bitwise operations assume two's complement 32bit integers, afaik
16:03  Maxdamantus: So 1 is stored as 0..01, so ~1 is ~1..10, which is 2^32-2-2^32
16:03  Maxdamantus: = 2^32-2^32-2 = -2
16:04  Maxdamantus: Er, 2^32-1-1-2^32 might be more clear.
16:05  Maxdamantus: Because all 1s would be 2^32-1, take another 1 for the 0 at the end
16:05  Maxdamantus: Then subtract 2^32 because the first bit is 1
16:05  Maxdamantus: (The two's complement bit)

17:05  ivan`_: Closure Library can mix colors
17:05  Phrogz: Munter: OK. At first I'm just going for a one-off of screen mode only, but my intent is to implement it as context.blend( context, modeString ) with a switch, so shouldn't be bad.
17:11  Phrogz: function drawBar(x, y, b, barLeft, barRight, offset, fillStyleCallback, axisx, axisy, c, horizontal, lineWidth)

17:14  Phrogz: I'll have to see how it handles alpha, as that is key to my needs.
17:14  darkfrog: I was under the impression that a div set to absolute position didn't get flowed with regular content?  I'm experiencing trouble with a div that I'm attempting to absolute position, but it's appearing after the rest of the content on the page.
17:15  Phrogz: darkfrog: If you don't specify a top/left, absolutely-positioned elements use the current flowed value.
17:15  Phrogz: But they don't interrupt the flow.
17:15  darkfrog: ah, perhaps that's the problem. :)
17:15  darkfrog: Phrogz: thanks...I'll give that a try
17:18  Phrogz: Hrm...Pixastic is both way more than I need, but also more limited (doesn't allow blending a small canvas onto an offset in a larger one). Back to work I go.
17:18  FireFly: Heh
17:19  FireFly: Phrogz, maybe you're interested in this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial/Compositing
17:20  Phrogz: FireFly: A good url, but no: I need "Photoshop"-style blend modes like Screen and Dodge.
17:22  FireFly: "lighter" is like PS "addition" though (or so I think; haven't checked the source of PS... :P)
17:22  FireFly: Other than the compositing modes, I think you have to do it manually
17:22  FireFly: e.g. by directly manipulating the Imagedata
17:23  Phrogz: Yup; well omw now.

17:29  Cryp71c: In firefox, when I access "document['someID']" where someID is the id of a swf object on the DOM, I get an object, correct?
17:30  Phrogz: Cryp71c: Don't rely on ugly DOM 0 stuff like that; go with document.getElementById()
17:30  Pilum: Cryp71c: For accessing IDs, use document.getElementById always
17:32  phenner: Hi guys. This may be the wrong place to ask about this but everywhere else seems either dead or closed!
17:32  Pilum: That's no excuse to go off-topic, phenner.
17:32  phenner: Well I am using JS!
17:32  Pilum: Let's hear it then.
17:32  phenner: Its AJAX really
17:33  phenner: That ok?
17:33 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
17:33  Pilum: Just ask already
17:33  phenner: ok!
17:33  phenner: Please see: http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/php-coding-help/ajax-product-selection-and-row-adddelete/
17:33  phenner: That is my project/problem
17:33  jullin: anyone?
17:36  Pilum: phenner: Some hint about where things stop would be nice.
17:36  Pilum: `doesn't work
17:36  jsBot: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
17:36  phenner: Ok sorry
17:36  phenner: Basically
17:37  phenner: The dropdown list using AJAX works fine and populates the table as you can see in the screenshots
17:37  jullin: Pilum. this was for me?
17:37  phenner: The problem I am having is with the add/delete rows business
17:37  Pilum: jullin: No. I don't do IE-only code.
17:37  jullin: in firefox it works
17:37  jullin: in ie it's not
17:37  phenner: At the moment, the system deletes all rows and not just specific ones
17:37  Pilum: Doesn't work in my firefox.
17:38  jullin: well im my full code it does. (the documenet selection) I left only the part for ie
17:38  phenner: And adding rows wise, the system is adding rows using JS and thus i reckon there will be problems when it comes to submitting the form
17:40  jullin: because only in ie i have problem
17:40  Pilum: phenner: So, not a JS problem after all then, considering your JS only deals with the ajax requet itself, and doesn't really do anything with the returned data.
17:40  phenner: Well it is.... because I do not get how I am supposed to get it to delete specific rows... :/?
17:41  Cryp71c: Phrogz, does getElementByID work for SWFs in IE 6?
17:42  Cryp71c: Pilum, or you ^
17:42  Pilum: Cryp71c: No. But getElementById should.
17:43  Cryp71c: Pilum, right, well that's what I'm trying, but I get an error popu for the script, let me paste in the details.
17:43  Pilum: phenner: Why not just pass the row reference to the function then instead of the table's ID?
17:43  Pilum: Or, possibly in addition to.
17:44  phenner: Pilum: Ok. Let me try that first. Thanks!
17:44  Cryp71c: Pilum, "Object does not support this property or method"
17:44  Phrogz: Cryp71c: Did you really get the capitalization correct?
17:45  Cryp71c: gah! ByID!
17:45  Cryp71c: Curses.
17:45  Phrogz: That's what Pilum was trying to tell you :p
17:46  Phrogz: WTF, Safari.   In dev tools, $('mycanvas').getContext('2d').getImageData(180,180,180,180).data; // Try to actually view the array of data, and Safari consumes 1GB of RAM and becomes non-responsive.
17:47  Pilum: GG
17:47  Phrogz: Perhaps Chrome will fare better.
17:48  gkatsev: Phrogz: what OS are you using?
17:49  Phrogz: gkatsev: OS X.
17:49  gkatsev: ok
17:49  MrNibbles: guys im having a bloody nightmare over here
17:50  Phrogz: Well, Chrome has only consumed 200MB so far, but it's been 100% CPU for over a minute, with just 100x100 sample.
17:50  Phrogz: Bah.
17:50  gkatsev: if I'll get rid of the blood, will that help?
17:50  MrNibbles: i need to disable keyboard scrolling in firefox -> this code works for everything else
17:50  MrNibbles: https://gist.github.com/9b834de5a93bf42f6e75
17:51  MrNibbles: any ideas why this wouldnt work for FF?
17:51  MrNibbles: i think ive literally tried everything
17:51  Pilate: #jquery
17:51  Cryp71c: Pilum, Phrogz, thanks. I fear for the number of people out there building libraries and whatnot using document[...] instead of getElementById. I've had a major script which works with a massive implementation of Open Flash Charts 2 which hasn't been working in IE, but hadn't turned up in my testing.
17:51  MrNibbles: i originally wrorte it without jquery
17:52  Cryp71c: all because the developer who wrote OFC2 used document[]
17:52  MrNibbles: thought perhaps the event handling code in jquery would help out, biut itdoesnt
17:52  NoiseEee: MrNibbles: is FF not returning the same keyCode as the others?
17:52  ivan`_: tried keypress? seen http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html ?
17:52  Pilum: Never heard of OFC2 before heh. And apparently he's an ignorant twit.
17:52  Cryp71c: er, I fear for the number of people out there building libraries and whatnot with such poor fundamental javascript knowledge*
17:52  NoiseEee: keycode is the only cross-browser one iirc, ivan`_
17:52  MrNibbles: NoiseEee: keycodes are the same
17:52  phenner: Pilum: Thanks. Now when trying to add a new row I get this: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'className' of null addRowrows.js:8 (anonymous function)neworder.php:328 onclick
17:52  Cryp71c: Pilum, what's scary is that its mostly written in PHP, but uses javascript in some special parts to post image-versions of the flash graphs back to the server.
17:53  Cryp71c: Its a great php graph library, but clearly his javascript knowledge is fundamental, to say the least.
17:56  Pilum: More like fundamentally flawed.
17:56  phenner: @Pilum Scrap that. It now deletes the default row when trying to add one because I added this code: delbutton.onClick = deleteRow(tableID, 'row'+rowCount);
17:56  NoiseEee: hey, MDC was redesigned / respons quicker??
17:56  Cryp71c: Pilum, apparenly he didn't some testing too. There was some limited logic that looked for 'Microsoft' in something, and if it found it, used "window[divID]", else "document[divID]"
17:56  MrNibbles: ivan`_: thanks, unfortunately that hasnt really helped :(
17:56  NoiseEee: no idea really MrNibbles, is the doctype html5?
17:56  MrNibbles: yep
17:56  MrNibbles: ooh
17:56  MrNibbles: actually
17:56  MrNibbles: not always
17:56  MrNibbles: its for a bookmarklet :S
17:56  MrNibbles: in my test page it is
17:56  MrNibbles: although im not sure why that would make a difference?
17:56  NoiseEee: MrNibbles: ahh, no idea about bookmarklets really sorry.  id check maybe if html5 reacts differently than others though
17:57  MrNibbles: i dont think that would change the event handling
17:58  MrNibbles: returning false from keydown/release works in all other browsers
18:00  MrNibbles: why firefox whyyyy
18:00  MrNibbles: you used to be so awesome
18:00  MrNibbles: now you are this generations ie6
18:00 * MrNibbles removes the firefox sticker from his laptop
18:00  MrNibbles: ... ok perhaps a bit too overdramatised
18:00  MrNibbles: ... ill just go moan in #firefox
18:08  Sorella: MrNibbles ≣ what exactly doesn't work on FF? What's the expected behaviour and what do you get instead?
18:08 --- cheney is now known as austincheney
18:08  Sorella: buubot: doesn't work @ MrNibbles
18:08  buubot: Sorella: doesn't work is Look buddy, doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it making faces at you? Does it want more money? Is it sleeping with your girlfriend? Please be specific!
18:13  Cryp71c: When you do a window.open() which directs DIRECTLY to a file (say, pdf) in firefox / chrome it works perfectly, but in IE you see a window pop up and then immediately close. I've found that the reason the pdf doesn't open is because that window that's popping up is actually giving you a "Internet Explorer has blocked a download from occuring" toolbar thing, that you can click on to override.
18:14  Cryp71c: But since the window closes so quickly, obviously you don't have an opportunity to allow the download. Is there any work around for this (either to prevent the window from closing automatically, or to sidestep the download protection stuff?)
18:16  atxq: I have a .js file that would generate a calander, but now the script stopped working for some reason.
18:16  ivan`_: Cryp71c: I don't know, but open a page that redirects to the pdf?
18:16  phenner: Hi Guys! Can anoyone tell me why this might be being kicked back as tableID is not defined when tableID is sent to the method that this code is inside: delbutton.onclick = new Function("deleteRows(tableID, rowCounter)");
18:17  ivan`_: Cryp71c: are you sure it's because of the default block, and not no-cache issues or related?
18:17  Sorella: buubot: doesn't work @ atxq
18:17  buubot: Sorella: doesn't work is Look buddy, doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it making faces at you? Does it want more money? Is it sleeping with your girlfriend? Please be specific!
18:18  jshriver: greetings
18:18  Sorella: buu
18:18  jshriver: how could I create the equivalent of char variable[40][40] in javascript?
18:18  ivan`_: an array of arrays
18:18  atxq: what is the best way that I can fix the script?
18:18  jshriver: aye
18:19  Sorella: jshriver ≣ with an Array of Arrays
18:19  MrNibbles: Sorella: http://jsfiddle.net/ua8zt/
18:19  atxq: is there a program that I can use to scan for js errors
18:19  NoiseEee: atxq: probably by starting with the errors
18:19  jshriver: but each element needs only be a char since I'm only storing on off values
18:19  MrNibbles: i think i have worked it out actually
18:19  MrNibbles: looks like firefox binds its scroll handlers to onkeypress
18:19  NoiseEee: atxq: what browser? what erros are you getting now?
18:19  MrNibbles: not keydown/keyup
18:19  NoiseEee: MrNibbles: thanks for passing on the solution
18:19  jshriver: I'm very new to javascript.
18:20  atxq: I am on ff; I get no errors. just a blank page. was working fine before
18:20  atxq: should install firebug?
18:20  NoiseEee: atxq: errors in firebug console?   yes, you should.  is it JUST js or maybe backend errors?
18:20  Sorella: `doesn't work @ atxq
18:20  jsBot: atxq: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
18:20  atxq: I get a blank page
18:21  Kafetist: opera has built in debug tools, doesn't it?
18:21  atxq: must be some kind of punctuation that is misplaced or something, but I searched and did not find anything
18:21  atxq: let me give firebug a try here
18:22  Sorella: saying you get a blank page is still pretty much pointless
18:22  Sorella: `help @ atxq
18:22  jsBot: atxq: help: Paste the Javascript (only the portions relevant to your problem) in a pastebin (see `paste), and tell us what you expected, what else you tried and what actually happened. You might also consider reading: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/05/05/why_we_wont_help_you/

18:23  Sorella: yulaughingatme.jpg :<
18:23  jrails: Can a function ever act like an attribute ... for example ....... I have an object that needs a particular attribute (such as title) defined, but I would rather define title as a function and not an attribute
18:23  NoiseEee: i dont understand
18:24  atxq: what is the link to the pastebin?
18:24  Sorella: `paste
18:24  jsBot: paste: Paste links, not code: http://erxz.com/pb/   http://pastebin.parentnode.org/   http://www.webdevout.net/test
18:24  jrails: Similar to ruby, where I can say myObject.title .... but it really runs myObject.title()
18:24  ElGoorf: what sort of function would you like the title attribute to do?
18:24  mads-: codepad.org is also good
18:25  Sorella: jrails ≣ a getter? Sure, but it's not implemented in all engines yet
18:25  Sorella: I prefer sprunge.us, it's delicious :3
18:25  isaqual: any good way to parse xml ?
18:25  Sorella: isaqual ≣ why are you using xml with javascript?
18:25  NoiseEee: boo Sorella
18:26  jrails: when an attribute is missing, does javascript call any sort of missing_attribute method on the object.  So for example, if it did I could hook into that method and do stuff
18:26  atxq: http://pastebin.parentnode.org/103787
18:26  Sorella: jrails ≣ __noSuchMethod__, but again, it's not implemented in all engines (and I'm not sure if it's standard or not)
18:26  jrails: So for example ... do myObject.foo trigger a call to myObject.missing_attribute('foo')
18:27  isaqual: Sorella: Because API we use doesn't support anything else.
18:27  jrails: Sorella, thanks.. I will look into __noSuchMethod__
18:27  Sorella: isaqual ≣ can't you use JSON on your API? It'd really help you out a lot.
18:27  isaqual: Sorella: I know but only xml is supported :(
18:28  atxq: I have spend lots of time alreay trying to find the problem, but with no success. I am thinking it is some issue with punctuation
18:28  isaqual: Sorella: and javascript and xml support is something like != I think
18:28  NoiseEee: isaqual: of course you can parse XML with JS, its a bit of a pain but there should be about 1,000,000 examples on  the google
18:29  Sorella: isaqual ≣ I'm not sure how'd you go about XML parsing in JavaScript. Perhaps you can use the DOM Api to parse it somehow, but I'm only taking assumptions here.
18:29  jrails: I'm using Titanium Appcelerator's javascript which is interpreted into native iPhone widgets.  Not sure how flexible the API is.
18:29  atxq: not seeing an error.problem in firefug
18:29  Sorella: Otherwise you can search for a lib to do that.
18:29  NoiseEee: isaqual: i take it you're talking about an XML response via XHR or something?
18:29  gkatsev: treat the XML as a tree. That's the easiest
18:29  jrails: Oh just realized you were talking to someone else.... thanks for th ehelp
18:29  isaqual: NoiseEee: I have found allmost all those solutions, but I just thought if there is THE solution :)
18:30  gkatsev: isaqual: *the* solution is whatever solutino you choose to go with, really.
18:30  isaqual: Sorella: I have done it with Jquery before. the best solution I know
18:30  Sorella: gkatsev ≣ does Node.js has something like libxml2?
18:30  NoiseEee: isaqual: just be sure its cross browser. if you like jquery's methods, then go for it.
18:30  isaqual: gkatsev: youre right , I'm just prograstinating or something like that
18:31  Sorella: procrastinating?
18:31 * Sorella does that all the time...
18:31  isaqual: thats is the word
18:32  gkatsev: Sorella: I think they are working on porting e4x, actually. But there may be other xml libs as well
18:32  isaqual: NoiseEee: I think Jqeury have good combatibility .
18:33  NoiseEee: isaqual: it certainly should
18:33  Sorella: hm, I dislike xml too much at any rate.
18:33  gkatsev: Sorella: does this help? https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules#parsers
18:33  isaqual: xml is so old skool
18:33  gkatsev: 9 modules
18:33  gkatsev: and yes, one of them is libxml2
18:33  ivan`_: if __repr__ returns a string, what would you call a __repr method that pushes to an Array?
18:34  ivan`_: naming is hard
18:34  isaqual: :D
18:34  Sorella: ivan`_ ≣ this is not Python...
18:34  gkatsev: sure isn't.
18:35  Sorella: but internal method names in JavaScript are now mixed with Python convention and Java convention.
18:35  gkatsev: 2 even are libxml2
18:35  Sorella: and that looks hella wierd
18:35  ivan`_: hey, Mozilla started it in their 1.5+ series
18:35  Sorella: >trollopjs ~ love this module's name
18:36  gkatsev: lol
18:36  Sorella: ivan`_ ≣ not sure tho. Perhaps __addToRepr__?
18:36  Sorella: that is giant to type though
18:36  gkatsev: only trollops I approve off are from the mythadventures series, such as Tanda
18:36  ivan`_: Sorella: thanks, good idea
18:37  ivan`_: it's __reprToPieces__ right now, which sucks
18:37  ivan`_: maybe __pushRepr__
18:38  gkatsev: why not just have normal names?
18:38  Sorella: yeah. If you take out the underscores you'll have four characters less to type and 4 bytes less on the dist file :3
18:38  NoiseEee: normal is so 1994
18:38  gkatsev: 1994 is the new black
18:39  Sorella: that's why pink is the awesome thing nowadays
18:40  NoiseEee: you rebel.
18:42  mordof: got a friend looking to start the basics of javascript, what's a good tutorial to start him on?
18:42  Sorella: `eloquent @ mordof
