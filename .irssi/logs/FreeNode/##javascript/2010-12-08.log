00:24  xp_prg: how do I copy a cell in a table to another cell in that table, do I have to use createNode?
00:24  xp_prg: or am I limited to only copying certain attributes?
00:26  Pilate: theres a cloneNode, idk about support
00:26  xp_prg: does javasciprt support for each etc... ?

00:42  adeel: Hishi[Revo], i'm having trouble figuring out 'best practices' in file/function layout for my js code, and was wondering if anyone had links/tips they could share to help shed light on this issue...most of the books/tutorials i'm reading never cover this topic
00:53  bampersand: anyone have experience with combining java and javascript? i know they are totally different technologies, basically im wanting to peek inside the applet as such but id have to use java reflection, but i dont know how to do this by using javascript, im sure itll be possible and ive been told it can be just there may be securty issues that block me..yeah need someone with vast experience for help.
00:54  bampersand: (yes and i just noticed the topic "not java", but seriously i need help to even start)
00:55  inimino: bampersand ⋱ You might try #java.  I'm happy to regard applets as obsolete.
00:55 * Pilum too.
00:55  bampersand: yeah i know theyre obsolete, but i cant help it, its not my applet.
00:55  bampersand: and er, i cant go to java.
00:56  Pilum: Why not?
00:56  bampersand: they have a no aplet polciy
00:56  Pilum: Heh.
00:56  Pilum: Sensible of them.
00:56  bampersand: true.
00:56  inimino: MDC does have some pages on the topic.
00:56  inimino: `ref mdc liveconnect
00:56  v8bot: inimino: LiveConnect - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/LiveConnect
00:56  bampersand: but eh, i wouldnt mind this project because all the other alike programs are pascal or pure java.
00:57  inimino: that's not exactly it but if you poke around from there you might find some relevant documentation
00:58  bampersand: cheers
00:58  bampersand: iirc last time i tried live connect it didnt work properly
00:58  bampersand: i may have done it wrong.
01:04  bampersand: cheers for the liveconnect link, this could work..

02:16  barrymcgee: hey.. I was wondering if someone can help me out with a scope issue? http://logical.pastebin.com/xWgW1QRT - I need the var globVideoID to be available outside the function feedLoaded()
02:17  Pilate: it should be available as it is
02:21  barrymcgee: if I 	console.log(window.globVideoID); outside the function it returns '(an empty string)'
02:21  Pilate: is it ever actually getting set with data?

02:33  DX^: Can someone please explain the difference to me of event capturing and event bubbling?
02:33  DX^: I read about it, but I got confused as all hell
02:34  DX^: here's my problem, I added a listener to a resize event on a div to give me the new width and pass it off, but it's giving me the old width before the resize
02:34  DX^: so I think it's in the bubbling phase, is that right?
02:34  DX^: I need to make it in the capture phase of the parent?
02:36  grayatrox: I need some help with a javascript slider. I have written a demo page showing the problem along with more info -->http://grayatrox.info/
02:40  vacuoustruth: DX: capturing is rarely used. you probably want bubbling.
02:43  vacuoustruth: DX: ie supports events for resize events for elements, but none of the other broswers do. for them the resize event fires when the the browser window is resized
02:46  DX^: vacuoustruth: I'm using Qooxdoo
02:46  DX^: which has a resize listener
02:46  DX^: because its a UI
02:47  DX^: the thing is, it's firing before it changes the width in the style and driving me kind of nuts
02:49  vacuoustruth: DX: i'm not familiar with that lib, but there should be a reference to the element in the resize handler. It should be changed at that point, unless there's an onbeforeresize or something weird.

03:02  vacuoustruth: DX: here's the code for the resize handler http://qooxdoo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qooxdoo/trunk/qooxdoo/framework/source/class/qx/event/handler/ElementResize.js?revision=24273&view=markup
03:03  vacuoustruth: DX: it looks like it stores the initial width and height when registering the event. then checks for new width and height on a timer. if i'm reading this correctly, it should have the new width and height.
03:03  vacuoustruth: DX: timer = an interval
03:05  vacuoustruth: DX: it calls a method fireNonBubblingEvent. the third param is an array whose first and third indices are the new width and height respectively.
03:06  vacuoustruth: DX: so i'm guessing in your handler you need to get the third param and check those indices
03:10  vacuoustruth: DX: thought you should just be able to pull the new values off the element itself, that array is useful because it contains the old values from the last timer reading (or whatever)

09:36  Pe3k: hello, I cant understand this regexp (?:0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\.(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])\.(?:19|20\d{2})    ...it is supposed to be test for correct date, but those ?: couples at beginning each parenthesis are strange for me ...
09:36  Pe3k: any idea?
09:36  Pilate: why in the world would you ask here
09:37  Pe3k: Pilate: sorry
