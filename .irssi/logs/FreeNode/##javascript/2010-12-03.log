13:10 --- Channel ##javascript was synced in 146 seconds
13:12  SolarBoom: farhad2010: What do you mena by saying change the javascript?
13:12  farhad2010: i want to by pass validation of a webpage by changing javascript files
13:13  farhad2010: SolarBoom:i want to by pass validation of a webpage by changing javascript files
13:15  SolarBoom: farhad2010: Please more specific why you want to change javascript files? you can change file on server side
13:16  farhad2010: SolarBoom:the site is not mine
13:17  SolarBoom: farhad2010: as I said files can be changed by server side
13:17  farhad2010: SolarBoom:how?
13:18  SolarBoom: farhad2010: this channel is not for discussing server side langs
13:19  farhad2010: SolarBoom:javascript is client side and i want to change javascript!
13:19  SolarBoom: farhad2010: impossible
13:19  Sorella: farhad2010 ≣ javascript is not client side >_>
13:21  SolarBoom: farhad2010: btw saying "I want to change javascript" is ilogical
13:22  Sorella: farhad2010 ≣ I doubt you can bypass a site's validation on the client side anyways, unless the site has some pretty shitty security hole you can exploit. All validations are usually take on the server side, and the client side only gets a snapshot of the current state, changing it won't get you anything.
13:23  farhad2010: Sorella:i know that but i want to bypass clientside
13:24  Sorella: >i know I can't do it but I still want to do it
13:24  Sorella: oh, good lord
13:26  fatbrain: (maybe he wants to test the serverside, *BOOM!*)

14:46  LachlanH: Hi guys. I'm trying to make a div display underneath another div when I mouse over it (i.e. a popup menu). The problem I'm having is positioning it correctly. I need it to display directly below. Does anybody have suggestions about achieving this?
14:47  TheSheep: position:absolute and putting it insde original div
14:47  TheSheep: with position:relative on it
14:51  kkaefer: is there a method that returns *all* properties names (not only "own" properties or enumerable properties)?
14:51  kkaefer: with for...in, I get all enumerable properties
14:51  TheSheep: kkaefer: 'enumerable'?
14:52  kkaefer: you can declare properties as non-enumerable
14:52  Sorella: for .. in only gets enumerable properties afaik
14:52  kkaefer: Sorella: that's what I said
14:52  Sorella: oh
14:52  kkaefer: and with getOwnPropertyNames, I can get all *own* properties of the object
14:53  kkaefer: but I also want to find out non-enumerable non-own properties
14:53 * Sorella checks the spec...
14:53  kkaefer: do I have to recurse through all prototypes with getPrototypeOf?
14:54  kkaefer: or is there an easier way?
14:56  Sorella: yeah, don't see any method that returns all properties of an object in the prototype
14:58  kkaefer: var properties = []; do { properties.push.apply(properties, Object.getOwnPropertyNames)); } while (obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj));
14:58  kkaefer: something like that maybe
15:01  Sorella: yep, you have to call Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj) though
15:03  Sorella: also, I'd rather use a while .. do, than do .. while in this case, just in case someone pass an undefined object, and cache the Object.* calls too
15:04  Sorella: or you can just cast everything to Object...
15:26  eKyNoX: Hi
15:27  Ond: HEy
15:37  Ibis: Can someone help me with a "webpage" resizing script? A website is horizontally divided into 3 parts. (Actually, a fix body height size script).        What it would do is get the height of the entire table size, get height of the "header & foot", then subtract the header & foot size from the "table" and add the results to the "body", as it's a "fix body size" script.
15:38  Ibis: I did this, but this script only spewed out errors. :/       var rtable = document.getElementById('table').offsetHeight;var rhead = document.getElementById('t-head').offsetHeight;var rfoot = document.getElementById('t-foot').offsetHeight;document.getElementById('t-body').style.height = ((rtable - rhead) - rfoot)+'px';
15:40  Ibis: Script works fine, but I just dont like seeing JS errors on my IE browsers.
15:47  timtoady_: :)
15:49  _sudo: :/
15:51  _sudo: test
15:53  kaylee_work: :| so IE is throwing an error.... but I don't know what's calling it.... suggestions on tracking it back?
15:55  _sudo: eh.. ie is anoying to debug
15:55  kaylee_work: indeed
15:56  _sudo: well if you are completely lost you can use ie's debugger.
15:56  kaylee_work: in Chrome I'm seeing "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'dispatchEvent'
15:57  Ibis: I hate I.E. But so many of my darn friends still uses that crap to the point I have to make it work. -.-
15:57  _sudo: so its not an ie only issue?
15:58  kaylee_work: well the problem _I_ have is I'm writing new stuff for the content of the page.... but the menu and various wrap around stuff is pre-existing... and sometimes crap... and I have no control over it
15:58  kaylee_work: so sometimes the errors are in the framework
15:58  _sudo: what framework
15:59  kaylee_work: MY stuff is functioning properly, and firefox and chrome don't show the error unless I've got the developer tools open
15:59  kaylee_work: it's custom
16:01  _sudo: well if there is an error with firrebug open there is also an error with it closed.  What triggers the event, a button click?
16:01  kaylee_work: so when I tell IE to open it's craptastic debugger... it takes me to a line in prototype that says "element.fireEvent(event.eventType, event);"
16:01  _sudo: I meant what triggers the error
16:02  kaylee_work: page load
16:02  kaylee_work: oh, I mean only ie actually pops up and shoves an error message in your face
16:02  kaylee_work: I know it's still going to be there
16:03  _sudo: oh so you are using the prototype framework?
16:03  kaylee_work: but if the page works, and the end user doesn't get it shoved in their face... I wouldn't care very much
16:03  kaylee_work: something is... don't remember if mine is or not
16:03  kaylee_work: better check that
16:03  kaylee_work: the specific function that the debugger is taking me to... I don't see it referenced in my stuff
16:03  kaylee_work: so what I need help with is tracking back what called it
16:04  _sudo: well the errors will sometimes have a stack in firebug
16:05  kaylee_work: hum... better look again... maybe I missed that
16:06  kaylee_work: hum ... I don't see it on page load in firefox
16:06  kaylee_work: oh wait, it is
16:10  kaylee_work: ok... found where firebug shows the line in the script.... and I see in the right side where it says "stack" ... and it's empty
16:11  _sudo: does the error have a + next to it with more information in the console
16:13  kaylee_work: yup
16:14  kaylee_work: one sec

16:16  pigdude: anyone know of a standalone lib that implements onhashchange portably?
16:16  pigdude: for instance, Ext.History does this but clearly depends on ExtJS
16:16  pigdude: (using polling for old browsers)
16:17  zeroooooo: I have two plugins in my wordpress blog which use js collapse expand, but they conflicting on the sidebard. What do I do? Both plugins are rendering an collapse/expand button on top of each other
16:18  pigdude: if not I will write one, but I was having trouble finding this
16:18  pigdude: zeroooooo: no clue. paste your code
16:18  pigdude: zeroooooo: or a link if it is a live site and you are unsure about the code
16:18  _sudo: kaylee_work: hmmmmm.  I'm not sure what to tell you besides walk through your page load with a debugger.  I can't really give you any more advice without code.
16:18  kaylee_work: thanks!
16:18  kaylee_work: I'll see what else I can find
16:19  pigdude: _sudo: Function.prototype.toSource() :^)
16:19  pigdude: _sudo: of course he can provide code
16:20  _sudo: pigdude: I doubt the error is from prototype
16:20  _sudo: I work with Ext all day and it constantly complains about errors in Exts source when the error is just a result of something I wrote
16:21  _sudo: oh function.prototype
16:21  _sudo: when I was saying prototype I was referring to the framework
16:22  zeroooooo: http://pastebin.com/6T20dGRN
16:23  _sudo: pigdude: BTW, I don't know of anything like Ext.History (since I use Ext I haven't looked) but the source for it is available if you wanted to rework it into something non Ext http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/source/History.html#cls-Ext.History
16:25  pigdude: _sudo: sure, that would be my next step because I usu don't create something like this from scratch
16:25  pigdude: _sudo: i.e. see what others do first
16:25  pigdude: _sudo: oh what I was saying earlier is that he could get source code easily if he wanted to
16:25  pigdude: _sudo: unless it were deliberately obfuscated
16:25  pigdude: _sudo: I often use toSource() for this, although if I have a question about code, I usu. have it in my editor so not a concern
16:26  _sudo: yeah, no need to reinvent the wheel.  I figured I would just give you a link to its code to make it easier if you do need to write your own
16:26  NoiseEee: friggin' thanks _sudo
16:26  _sudo: NoiseEee: ?
16:27  NoiseEee: thats a nice resource
16:27  NoiseEee: i really like ben_alman's bbq for that kind of thing
16:27  NoiseEee: but thats another great resource
16:28  NoiseEee: cross-browser history/application state used to be the bane of my existence
16:28  _sudo: lol I wasn't saying rewrite it.  Noone was suggesting anything so I mentioned the code was available if he had to.
16:29  _sudo: perhaps you should have spoken up sooner ;)
16:29  drubies: anyone here use jasmine for unite testing?
16:29  Ibis: I.E doesn't seem to like this script, spitting out errors: var rtable = document.getElementById('table').offsetHeight;var rhead = document.getElementById('t-head').offsetHeight;var rfoot = document.getElementById('t-foot').offsetHeight;document.getElementById('t-body').style.height = ((rtable - rhead) - rfoot)+'px';
16:29  drubies: unit*
16:29  pigdude: NoiseEee: haha, why the bane?
16:29  pigdude: NoiseEee: I found it rather simple
16:29  NoiseEee: pigdude: just very hard to solve for a while. lots of non-cross-browser solutions
16:30  pigdude: NoiseEee: maybe for very very old browsers
16:30  pigdude: NoiseEee: but I never had trouble targeting ie6
16:30  NoiseEee: i inevitable found things broke. oh well
16:31  Ibis: It works, but I don't why I.E bothers me about it, the point of this script is so that it will "Get full table size", then get head & footer size.      THEN subtract head&footer size from TABLE and add it to the "body". So basically, this is my "fix the body size script", as it's made for a website divided into three parts (head, body foot).
16:33  Ibis: NoiseEee: I like the BBQ script too, the only thing I dislike is that the script doesn't load "NEW" content in case the page changes. I would like have to revisit the website to see the changes.
16:36  pigdude: NoiseEee: what sort of things?
16:36  pigdude: NoiseEee: maybe I was lucky but it was always pretty reliable
16:36  pigdude: NoiseEee: the tough thing was actually dealing w/ the change event properly, which really required a decent js app framework
16:36  pigdude: NoiseEee: so as to have some notion of routing
16:37  pigdude: NoiseEee: so I had to hack some thing together
16:37  shauntain_mobile: hey guys... i am reading a book at one point there is a line that says --- return (+num < 10 ? "0" : "") + num;  ---- what is the purpose of that first +num?
16:38  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: it will make a string a number
16:38  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: same as Number(s)
16:38  shauntain_mobile: but it javascript is losely typed then whats the point?
16:38  pigdude: v8: [1, -1, '2'].map(function(x) { return -x; }); // shauntain_mobile
16:39  v8bot: pigdude: [-1, 1, -2]
16:39  pigdude: er
16:39  pigdude: v8: [1, -1, '2'].map(function(x) { return +x; }); // shauntain_mobile
16:39  v8bot: pigdude: [1, -1, 2]
16:39  pigdude: that one
16:39  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: there are times where you have to force it to be a number, I don't know why I cannot think of a good example right now
16:39  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: the ambiguity can be a problem though
16:39  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: so you will cast like that
16:40  shauntain_mobile: pigdude:is it common practice to do this whenever there is a user input that is a number?
16:40  _sudo: '100' + 5
16:40  pigdude: v8: [+'1' + +'2', '1' + '2'] // shauntain_mobile
16:40  v8bot: pigdude: [3, "12"]
16:40  pigdude: shauntain_mobile: this is why it can be very important to be precise about this
16:41  shauntain_mobile: pigdude: thanks for you help
16:41  shauntain_mobile: pigdude: greatly appreciated
16:41  _sudo: I prefer parseInt I dont think a simple + is very readable
16:42  Gregor: parseInt parses an INT :P
16:42  Gregor: If you want a number and readability, Number(x) is the way to go.
16:42  pigdude: I prefer Number(o)
16:42  pigdude: yep
16:42  pigdude: maps to what I'm used to, like int(o) or (int) $o
16:42  pigdude: (int) o etc
16:42  _sudo: good point.  I wasn't thinking about non integers.
16:43  pigdude: +o just is odd to me
16:43  pigdude: but good for saving space if that matters
16:43  _sudo: readability is 100X more important than writability
16:43  pigdude: _sudo: well I'm thinking of js1k and similar golf
16:48  _sudo: well you can always do minification.  No it wont turn a parseInt into a + but it cuts it down quite a bit.
16:48  _sudo: it meaning the code
16:50  amh345: hi guys, im trying to setup some UJS in my app..  throwing an error on   callRemote: function ()  my js pastie is here http://pastebin.com/GTpF62Xm   i cant figure out if this is a straight JS error or a #jquery issue...   im finding little info on it.
16:51  drubies: different question: with no DOM, how do you include or require another javascript file?
16:51  drubies: .. very basic i know
16:51 --- Ibis is now known as Ibis-hates-ie
16:53  pigdude: drubies: ajax
16:53  _sudo: with no DOM?  How did you lose that? :P
16:53  pigdude: drubies: eval responsetext
16:53  pigdude: drubies: but I doubt you have xhr w/o dom
16:54  Sorella: drubies ≣ why no DOM? Which envinronment are you running your javascript in? Which engine? Give us more details.
16:54  drubies: i'm using jasmine for unit testing
16:54  drubies: which by default has no DOM
16:54  pigdude: drubies: if you are using a server-side implementation, at the very least you can use system calls to get your responsetext
16:55  pigdude: drubies: if there is no http lib
16:55  drubies: it's driven through ruby, which reads a yaml file for SRC files to load, and requires all in batch
16:55  pigdude: drubies: so where is the js engine?
16:55  drubies: it requires *all* of the individual scripts for my app sidewide
16:55  Sorella: drubies ≣ but what's running Jasmine? You need a javascript engine to run it all
16:55  drubies: it runs through selenium
16:55  pigdude: drubies: so you can access XUL stuff?
16:55  drubies: i just want to load scripts independently for each spec
16:56  pigdude: drubies: I don't know too much about selenium, but good luck
16:56  drubies: i'm not familiar w/ XUL stuff? I've been manipulating the DOM for like a year and am only now coring down deeper into JS
16:57  pigdude: drubies: XUL is the framework used to write Selenium
16:58  pigdude: drubies: Komodo IDE uses it, and some other software
16:58  pigdude: drubies: it was developed by Mozilla, I believe. its main deployment is in firefox
16:58  Sorella: Take a look at the selenium docs to see if they provide a nice way of loading files/scripts.
16:58  pigdude: drubies: all firefox extensions use XUL
16:59  drubies: nice, both good things to be searching on thanks
16:59  gkatsev2: selenium has an addScript function

17:22  todd: if there are any frozen processes under screen kill them and then try to reattach
17:22  todd: if that doesn't work you'll have to kill screen
17:23  gkatsev: how do I know what's frozen?
17:23  _sudo: Sorella: If I was root, why would I be doing a sudo?

17:25  NoiseEee: how do you do?
17:25  todd: make me a sammich.
17:25  todd: no?
17:25  todd: sudo make me a sammich.
17:25  todd: best shirt ever
17:25  _sudo: ok
17:29  gkatsev: todd: thanks fixed it. Killed a screen -rd that I guess was hanging up screen.
17:29  todd: sweet
17:29  todd: I love me some htop
17:29  gkatsev_: though, I had to kill that whole session
17:30  gkatsev_: i didn't even know about tree view until you told me
17:30  todd: if you don't have htop you can use PS

17:33  _sudo: I thought you said 90
17:33  gkatsev: I was estimating
17:33  todd: fivebean merged with another company requiring my VPS to be moved to a new data center
17:33  gkatsev: guess I was off
17:33  todd: sicne then they've rebooted the host twice
17:34  NoiseEee: sucks
17:34  todd: jerks
17:34  NoiseEee: thats why you pay the extra $10 for decent VPS hosting :P
17:34  NoiseEee: j/k
17:34  NoiseEee: kinda
17:34  todd: fivebean was awesome prior to merging
17:34  todd: I had linode for a while.
17:34  NoiseEee: i'm on slicehost ATM
17:34  gkatsev: prmgr is probably the cheapest VPS hosting available
17:34  _sudo: wish I had a VPS
17:34  NoiseEee: yeah, i go for reliable over cheap.
17:35  gkatsev: NoiseEee: prmgr is supposed to be very good/reliable as well, but I haven't use any so far.
17:35  todd: I use my VPS for everything so reliability is key.
17:35  NoiseEee: and in rackspace's data centers, i like slicehost is a++++
17:35  gkatsev: though, I will get one once I get my new site up in node eventually.
17:35  todd: It's my SSH tunnel, IRC, IM, e-mail..
17:36  todd: oh dev.. forgot that
17:36  todd: now that I work here I don't do much personal dev anymore.
17:36  gkatsev: lol

17:39  gkatsev: hehe, the pricing scheme on prgmr is very easy to understand. 4/mo + 1/mo for every 64MB RAM
17:39  _sudo: gah! *pukes
17:40  TheSheep: lastent: yes, but it's a very bad idea most of the time
17:40  NoiseEee: even just http://articles.slicehost.com/ is a crazy awesome resource
17:40  gkatsev: lastent: it is called eval, however, you are strongly discouraged to do so.
17:40  _sudo: dont say it!
17:40  _sudo: gah
17:40  lastent: TheSheep, gkatsev why is it a bad Idea?
17:41  gkatsev: `eval
17:41  jsBot: eval: eval() is evil from both performance and design perspectives.  If eval() is the answer, chances are you're asking the wrong question (although there are a very few cases where it's useful) -- read http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/11/01/53329.aspx .  See `==== for an alternative.
17:41  systemfault: `====
17:41  jsBot: ====: yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]
17:41  _sudo: When I see eval, I think the coder is incompetant.
17:41  TheSheep: lastent: metaprogramming is hard to understand, the resulting code may be easily insecure if any part of the string comes form user input and it can lead to memory leaks, becasue eval makes the current frame stay in themory as a closure
17:41  systemfault: So far, I never seen a legit use for it.
17:42  gkatsev: Gregor: show us a legitimate use for eval.
17:42  _sudo: translating json to an object
17:43  FireFly: Is there a way to remove an event listener from an element without having access to the event function supplied?
17:43  lastent: TheSheep, I have a function with an ajax request inside, so I want to pass some actions as parameter of the function, so this actions are executed after the request success, do you think there is a better way?
17:43  NoiseEee: _sudo: most browsers can do that now
17:43  Sorella: systemfault ≣ compiling, creating a VM in JavaScript that makes a good use of Trace Trees/JIT, meta-programming and stuff like that does good use of eval
17:44  NoiseEee: var jsObj = JSON.parse(jsonString)
17:45  _sudo: well all it is doing is an eval.  I didn't realize there was a native command for it though
17:46  carlocci: FireFly, if you haven't got some reference to what you want to remove, how will you know you are removing the right handler?
17:46  TheSheep: lastent: you can pass functins around
17:46  TheSheep: lastent: they don't have to be strngs
17:46  Sorella: _sudo ≣ JSON doesn't `eval` .-.
17:47  todd: ugh disqus
17:47  FireFly: carlocci, in this case I want to remove all attached events of a given type
17:47  FireFly: But yes, I see what you mean
17:47  lastent: TheSheep, and what do I do after passing the function, how do I execute it?
17:47  Sorella: todd ≣ what's wrong with disqus?
17:47  Ibyss: What's with the '≣'?
17:47  gkatsev: Sorella: it's disqusting.
17:47  gkatsev: jk
17:47  Sorella: FireFly ≣ you can create an abstract layer that handles the events for you, so you can later remove all of them by a simple for-iteration
17:47  todd: Sorella: all of the little nit picky things that my markets find that don't work.
17:47  FireFly: At least it uses OpenID, that's nice
17:48  shiftingcontrol: how can i auto submit the form after n minute,i know can use setTimeout('func()',n),i want javascript to click submit or submit the form after n minutes.
17:48  todd: for instance this morning I got a ticket about the like/dislike... I go to a news story, "53 likes", I click dislike, "22 likes", refresh, "53 likes".
17:48  todd: Also if I click dislike it adds it to my activity log as a like.
17:48  FireFly: Sorella, I would, if I wasn't altering an existing webpage (writing a userjs)
17:49  FireFly: s/userjs/userscript/
17:49  Sorella: shiftingcontrol ≣ 1) you don't need to click `submit` to submit a form, just use form.submit(), where `form` is a reference to your form. 2) You can't really create events on most browsers.
17:49  todd: and all the 100's of other emails that I've received and forwarded off to their VIP support.
17:49  carlocci: FireFly, unfortunately setting/getting event handlers is poorly implemented
17:49  FireFly: Hmm
17:49  _sudo: Sorella: NoiseEee: My apologies, I should research things before I assume
17:49  Sorella: you could augment the HTMLElement.prototype...?
17:49  TheSheep: lastent: by adding () after the variable name, normally
17:49  shiftingcontrol: Sorella:thank you ,but i am creating quiz app ,when timer expires it should submit
17:49  FireFly: Oh, right, that could work
17:50  lastent: TheSheep, I'll try
17:50  FireFly: Thanks for the tip, Sorella
17:50  Sorella: shiftingcontrol ≣ [14:49] <Sorella> shiftingcontrol ≣ 1) you don't need to click `submit` to submit a form, just use form.submit(), where `form` is a reference to your form.
17:50  NoiseEee: _sudo: ahh no worries!!
17:50  Sorella: `form`.submit() will submit your form. No need to click a button.
17:50  carlocci: userscript in greasemonkey are run onDOMContentLoaded
17:51  Sorella: baw, my mouse died
17:51  carlocci: FireFly, you can remove all events using cloneNode and substituting the node
17:51  shiftingcontrol: Sorella:fine
17:53  shiftingcontrol: Sorella:after form.submit() i used <?php print_r($_POST);?>it didnot output anything
17:55  Sorella: shiftingcontrol ≣ are you using `POST` as the form sending method? Is `form` an actual reference to your form element?
17:56  shiftingcontrol: Sorella:i m using php for submitting to server by post method
18:00  shiftingcontrol: Sorella:i got the code fixed i added <form id='quiz'> and changed code to document.forms['quiz'].submit and evaluated $_POST variable
18:03  Pilate: dont use document.forms now
18:15  PeterNL: Does anyone know how I can see if an server is actually online while executing an xmlhttprequest?

18:20  fjsdhfisdfihsdaf: hi
18:21  Ibyss: hi.
18:22  fjsdhfisdfihsdaf: is there any way to perform a command which is a string? like this: "document.writeln("hi");

18:23  fjsdhfisdfihsdaf: PeterNL: :)
18:23  PeterNL: :)

18:24  _sudo: we just had an eval discussion 10 minutes ago... again?
18:25  fjsdhfisdfihsdaf: thanks!!!
18:25  PeterNL: Don't use eval unless you really have to. If you think you ahve to, then think again. I've never used it...
18:25  PeterNL: Oh, he left :|
18:25  _sudo: only time I have used it is to dynamically load scripts
18:26  PeterNL: But I was playing with an xhr... It get's an readyState=2, but the server really is not running.
18:27  [1]pallet: anyone here use Vanadium?
18:28  PeterNL: Chromium Vadadium? I have as set of wrenches made of it...

19:03  Ibyss: I even applied  semicolons, which I would of done anyway.
19:03  Ibyss: Being a PHP coder and not JS coder.
19:03  PeterNL: Ibyss: I know the feeling :)
19:08  Sorella: fjsdhfisdfihsdaf ≣ no, JavaScript is single-threaded and thus can only EVER perform ONE INSTRUCTION AT A TIME. However, since the thread running the javascript is also shared with the UI (and thus the browser can only run JS or update de UI at any given time), some people are lead to think that they can update two DOM elements at the same time, when in fact the browser just didn't had the time to update the screen yet.
19:08  fjsdhfisdfihsdaf: Sorella: thanks :)
19:09  Sorella: fjsdhfisdfihsdaf ≣ as a better explanation you can try `setTimeout(function(){ alert("hello") }, 500); setTimeout(function(){ alert("world") }, 500)`

19:40  Sbioko: how to read object's methods?
19:40  Sbioko: file = e.dataTransfer.getData("application/x-vnd.adobe.air.file-list");
19:40  Sbioko: I need to get file's object methods
19:41  gkatsev: iterate over its prototype? or console.dir it in firebug or something
19:43  Sbioko: gkatsev: Adobe AIR
19:43  Sbioko: gkatsev: I set up drag and drop handlers
19:44  Sbioko: gkatsev: I need to get dropped file's path
19:44  Sbioko: gkatsev: those piece of code returns File object
19:44  Sbioko: gkatsev: but as I understood it is not native AIR objec
19:44  Sbioko: object
19:45  gkatsev: don't you want #actionscript or w/e then?
19:45  Sbioko: gkatsev: no, I code in HTML/CSS/Javascript
19:45  Sbioko: gkatsev: it is possible in AIR
19:45  gkatsev: ok
19:45  Sbioko: any suggestions?
19:45  Sbioko: plz help
19:46  gkatsev: look at the API docs?
19:46  Sbioko: yes
19:46  FireFly: That or iterating over the properties
19:46  Sbioko: I'll try
19:46  Sbioko: now
19:46  gkatsev: but you should still then have tools for doing something like console.log
19:46  Sbioko: air.trace
19:46  gkatsev: FireFly: yep, which was my first suggestion :)
19:47 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away

19:51  Sbioko: NoiseEee: nope
19:51  NoiseEee: Sbioko: yeah, well, thats a terrible line of JS there
19:52  NoiseEee: so you've got file and property, and then use use air and prop
19:52  Sbioko: NoiseEee: didn't understand
19:52  Sbioko: NoiseEee: I need to get all properties of an object
19:52  Sbioko: NoiseEee: could you please provide some code?
19:52  NoiseEee: then reference the damn object
19:52  preaction: Sbioko: what is "prop" in your code?
19:52  NoiseEee: http://forums.adobe.com/community/air/development
19:52  Sbioko: preaction: mistake, air.trace(property)
19:53  Sbioko: NoiseEee: most of topics are about Actionscript dev
19:53  preaction: and this is AS dev. not JS dev. perhaps you want ##actionscript?
19:53  Sbioko: preaction: JS dev
19:53  Sbioko: preaction: AIR allows both
19:54  Sbioko: javascript and actionscript
19:54  gkatsev: Sbioko: they might know more about what AIR exposes to js for objects and stuff
19:54  NoiseEee: Sbioko: i guarantee there are developer docs somewhere
19:54  Sbioko: NoiseEee: ofc
19:54  NoiseEee: nobody here really knows much about AIR afaik
19:55  Sbioko: NoiseEee: file is not a native AIR object I think
19:55  Sbioko: because it does not have all those native properties
19:55  Sbioko: that are in docs
19:57  Sbioko: thanks alll
20:05  Avi`: i wish i could store the first value in an if statement
20:05  Avi`: i guess i could before the if
20:05  gkatsev: a huge pet peeve of mine: JSON objects. That is all.
20:05  Avi`: is there some way to like.. get the args of an if statement, from within the if() itself?
20:05  TheSheep: Avi`: no
20:06  Avi`: basically I often find myself wishing I could compare the left most statement against SEVERAL values
20:06  Avi`: like if( x >1 && 2 && 3)
20:06  TheSheep: Avi`: switch?
20:06  gkatsev: isn't that a switch?
20:06  Avi`: thats a contrived example of course
20:06  gkatsev: though, I guess a switch only works with equality and not inequality
20:07  Avi`: yeah, i'd like it to be just basically
20:07  Avi`: compare the left most statement against several of these
20:07  TheSheep: gkatsev: in pascal it works with any operator :)
20:07  Avi`: without having to say if( x >3 && x > 2 && x > 1)
20:07  gkatsev: TheSheep: in scala and SML and similar you can do pattern matching awesomeness.
20:08  TheSheep: gkatsev: evil
20:08  gkatsev: TheSheep: pattern matching is AMAZING.
20:08  TheSheep: gkatsev: example?
20:09  gkatsev: function fact(0) return 1 | fact(n) return n * fact(n-1)
20:09  gkatsev: the cannonical example
20:10  gkatsev: furryfox provides some simple pattern matching as well

20:13 --- Users 463 nicks [0 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 463 normal]
20:13  gkatsev: another example of pattern matching
20:14  gkatsev: in fact in SML and scala it is cooler because you can match lists with the first item and everything else
20:14  gkatsev: so x::xs = List(1,2,3,4) will set x to 1 and xs to List(2,3,4)
20:15  gkatsev: TheSheep: pattern matching takes a bit of getting used to, but once you use it for a bit, you realize how amazing it is.

20:17  gkatsev: NoiseEee: no
20:17  flex_lamp: Have not seen FB do that
20:17  NoiseEee: feck
20:17  Avi`: well, I ended up using a switch
20:18  Avi`: I don't know if its more legible than if(x == "hi" || x == "yo" || x == "sup")
20:18  Avi`: but, it'll have to do
20:18  TheSheep: gkatsev: that's not pattern matching, that's just unpacking on assignment, it doesn't do any matching
20:19  gkatsev: TheSheep: js has only very simple pattern matching.
20:19  TheSheep: gkatsev: it has too much magic already
20:19  gkatsev: and by js I mean furryfox only

20:20  queso: I am creating a search feature and I want it to highlight the parts of the results that match the search terms (like what Facebook does).  Could someone help me write the code to do this?  Is it perhaps simple to do using regex methods?  For example, the search terms "joh do" (entered by user) would match "John Doe" (returned by server) and result in "<b>Joh</b>n <b>Doe</b>".
20:44  ecto: hi
20:54  pigdude: queso: typically this sort of thing is handled earlier on
20:55  pigdude: queso: for instance, sphinx search's build excerpts call can optionally inject markup around hits
20:55  pigdude: queso: you could probably get your text, stripped down, by accessing elements' innerHTML
20:55  pigdude: queso: recursively
20:59  queso: pigdude: good point
21:00  Inpetto: Hi all. A lot of public apis have ip based limits, and many applications resort to doing clientside api calls. However is it not a good idea to do a hybrid, that is use the client to handle api calls of bulk data and then send it to the server for processing, thereby not violating any usage limits?
21:01  ecto: Inpetto: depends on the situation

21:05  Inpetto: ecto: okay, well lets use a giant like twitter as an example. they impose usage limits. lets say theres a site that gathers retweets or hash tags of various tweets  depending on what the user queries. so i guess in that setup, a user enters a query and then raw unprocessed data is  then loaded from the json api of twitter... which is then sent to the server to be processed and to give something back to the user (lets say tables
21:05  aro: its ie 8
21:05  felixjet: if i have var a = "whatever"; and i want to match using a.match();

21:14  FireFly: Hrm
21:14  FireFly: JS regex doesn't have lookbehind, does it?
21:14  gkatsev: no
21:14  pigdude: FireFly: but it's easy enough to spoof
21:14  gkatsev: only lookahead
21:14  FireFly: pigdude, true
21:14  gkatsev: which is what ?= is
21:14  FireFly: Yep
21:14  pigdude: v8: 'abc'.replace(/a(.)(?=c)/, '$1')
21:14  v8bot: pigdude: "bc"
21:15  pigdude: FireFly: ^^
21:15  gkatsev: pigdude: though, why the nested lookahead?
21:15  pigdude: gkatsev: it was a yo dawg joke
21:15  pigdude: gkatsev: "I heard you like zero-width assertions"
21:15  FireFly: He put a lookahead in your lookahead
21:15  pigdude: and a zero width assertion in the zero width assertion in the zero width assertion (\b is one too)
21:16  pigdude: that is what my sad mind was shooting for :^)

21:27  orentanay: I'm working on a site that has some JS I don't have access to, but I can add extra js code. I'm trying to remove the click event that was applied to an A tag like so domainLinks[i].onclick = function() {this.href = pageTracker._getLinkerUrl(this.href);}
21:28  gkatsev: you should be able to remove all onclick events if you want
21:29  orentanay: gkatsev, what code can I use to remove the click event? thanks.
21:30  gkatsev: domainLinks[i] = function(){}; may or may not work.
21:30  Bar_: Hi, printing question: I want a button that when clicked, it will show the print dialog, but only for a specific image on the page.. is that possible ?
21:30  aro: is there a size limit to javascript variables/
21:31  gkatsev: aro: ints in js can only go up to 2^53
21:32  p3lim: I've made an "infinitescroll" script for my blog, though every post entry with an audio file that gets loaded with AJAX gets a flash bug of some sort, it won't show the content, just says that Flash 9 is required
21:32  p3lim: any of you know how to fix that?
21:32  Tempus2: does anyone know if http://pastebin.com/Tcw9ESka works with Safari and Chrome?
21:33  aro: its not an int
21:33  aro: its a string var
21:34  aro: and its about 155k in size
21:34  skamikaze: Tempus2: test it?
21:34  skamikaze: :)
21:35  p3lim: here is my script for reference: https://github.com/p3lim/endless/raw/master/endless.js
21:36  Tempus2: I guess I need to install Safari and Chrome anyway. Can't go here everytime heh
21:37  aro: http://pastebin.com/YkA6Bc3t
21:37  aro: thats my JSON
21:37  aro: can that be stored in a string var in JS?
21:37  NoiseEee: uh, yes
21:37 --- Bar_ is now known as Bartzy|work
21:38  gkatsev: aro: 2^20 chars seems to be like a good starting off point for the limit, also, different browsers have different actual limits
21:38  aro: so this is roughly 600k
21:38  NoiseEee: aro: why would you need that much data at once
21:39  aro: because its for some dynamic menus on the page
21:39  NoiseEee: sounds like you either need pagination of some sort, or to load the data that you need
21:39  aro: but unfortunately they are sending us a huge dump of data
21:39  aro: via a web service
21:39  gkatsev: why do you have a 150K string?
21:39  aro: did you read what i just said
21:39  gkatsev: ah, ok, missed it.
21:40  aro: yeah
21:41  Tempus2: What is IRSeek anyway? It said #javascript would soon be logged.
21:42  todd: IRC indexer
21:42  gkatsev: a service to logging channels or something
21:42  gkatsev: `paste
21:42  jsBot: paste: Paste links, not code: http://erxz.com/pb/   http://pastebin.parentnode.org/   http://www.webdevout.net/test
21:42  Tempus2: Anyway, chrome didn't support my script. That sucks. I doubt Safari would be any better
21:42  gkatsev: if we don't like pastebin why is it in the topic?
21:44  Tempus2: I use Pastebin because it supports Linden Scripting hightlighting
21:45  pigdude: Tempus2: what is that?
21:46  Tempus2: Scripted Objects in SecondLife
21:46  pigdude: ah
21:46  pigdude: I don't use pastebin because it has crap all over the page
21:46  pigdude: paste.pocoo.org ftw
21:46  Tempus2: Chrome and Safari JavaScript = sigh
21:46  pigdude: and I have a private lodgeit instance too
21:47  Tempus2: Doesn't Chrome and Safari use webkit?
21:47  NoiseEee: yes
21:47  gkatsev: I use gkatsev.pastebin.com, but I have adblock, so, I don't really see the crap and also new pastebin is kind of nice as well
21:47  Tempus2: DOes this affect the JavaScript?
21:47  NoiseEee: Tempus2: does what affect the javascript?
21:47  Tempus2: webkit
21:47  paxcoder: do you people know how to capture wheel up/wheel down events?
21:48  Tempus2: I am not sure what webkit involves
21:48  NoiseEee: i dont know what that means
21:48  NoiseEee: chrome and safari have great JS support if thats your question
21:48  pigdude: gkatsev: pastebin is not open source?
21:48  gkatsev: Tempus2: webkit is the DOM rendering engine
21:48  pigdude: gkatsev: you can't run your own pastebin?
21:48  Tempus2: Doesn't have anything to do with JavaScript then
21:49  gkatsev: pigdude: yeah, I guess. Well, when I get my own VPS i'll just roll my own/use someone else's to have it on my own domain and stuff
21:49  pigdude: paxcoder: this is interesting http://adomas.org/javascript-mouse-wheel/
21:49  gkatsev: Tempus2: safari uses javascriptcore and chrome uses v8 as the js engines
21:49  pigdude: gkatsev: I don't know whether it is open source or not
21:49  gkatsev: pigdude: I dont think so
21:49  pigdude: gkatsev: I was just curious if you knew
21:49  pigdude: ah
21:49  paxcoder: pigdude, thanks, dude
21:50  gkatsev: pigdude: oh, maybe you can
21:50  Tempus2: Anyone know if there's a method to test supported protocols with JavaScript for Chrome and Safari?
21:50  gkatsev: you can/you would to eventually.
21:51  gkatsev: Tempus2: there is has.js and yepnope.js that tell you which js features are available
21:51  Tempus2: where are those?
21:51  Tempus2: google.com?
21:52  gkatsev: google for them
21:52  Tempus2: Well, it wouldn't be so much use since I wouldn't even know what approach to use really

21:53  aro: anyone seen that error before?
21:53  Tempus2: Yes aro
21:53  Tempus2: means your syntax is wrong
21:53  aro: hmm
21:53  aro: the json validates on jsonlint
21:54  Tempus2: Missing a semi-colon or some string is incomplete etc..
21:54  aro: http://jsfiddle.net/M9tw6/4/
21:54  Tempus2: Just make sure you have all the paranteses, quotes and semicolons etc
21:54  gkatsev: Tempus2: there isn't always one solution.
21:54  Tempus2: Not always
21:54  Tempus2: I said when there is only one :)
21:55  Tempus2: although I forget you don't actually need semi-colons in javascript
21:55  Tempus2: I always put them in lol
21:55  Gregor: Perhaps the only thing that all JS style guides agree on is not to elide semicolons.
21:56  Tempus2: elide? What does that word mean?
21:56  Gregor: Leave out
21:56  Tempus2: So what you're saying is, make semi-colons?
21:57  rocket: hello..anyone know of a good javascript pattern or jquery plugin to  load content only when it comes into/get close to the window when vertically scrolling?
21:57  Gregor: What I'm saying is that about the only thing all JS style guides agree on is that you should include semicolons.
21:57  Tempus2: I am for semi-colons. Makes statements so much easier to identify
21:57  Tempus2: Espesially with all the short-cuts you can do in conditionals
21:58  gkatsev: rocket: what kind of content?
21:58  Tempus2: And I program so many other languages that must have semi-colons, it just falls natural to end a statement with a semi-colon
21:58  Sorella: Gregor ≣ I've really stopped including semicolons everywhere for aesthetic reasons. They're fugly and reduce readability for me
21:59  gkatsev: js does have ASI but if you don't know it by heart, it will fail
22:00  Tempus2: ASI?
22:00  Sorella: Automatic Semicolon Insertion
22:00  Tempus2: Ah :)
22:00  Tempus2: I knew that it did, just didn't know what it was called
22:01  Sorella: you should know them even if you're going to use semicolons
22:01  Tempus2: Know where the semi-colons go?
22:02  Tempus2: They go at the end of every statement heh
22:02  gkatsev: Sorella: right but if you use semicolons at the end of each line in js it is as important to know the ASI rules
22:02  Sorella: know how JavaScript decides whether it should add semicolons to an statement or not. And no, they don't go at the end of every statement...
22:02  elb0w: if a checkbox fires an onclick event when it hits that function how to I test to see if it was checked?
22:02  gkatsev: http://asi.qfox.nl/
22:03  elb0w: actually nvm
22:03  Sorella: I got 36 or something in that tests...
22:03  Tempus2: shouldn't you use onchange elb0w?
22:03  gkatsev: I never completed it
22:03  Sorella: I wonder if someone got 100% on it .-.
22:04  Haxicar: help
22:04  elb0w: Tempus2, yeah I suppose
22:04  Sorella: Haxicar ≣ no u

22:09  gkatsev: lol, yep

22:09  Haxicar: Can someone tell me what to do here? http://jsbin.com/ipupu3
22:09  Sorella: except you still need the braces noise
22:09  EvanR-wo1k: wouldnt a semi colon after all function expressions cause syntax error
22:10  Tempus2: define function expression

22:10  Sorella: what's that phrase even...? D:
22:10  EvanR-wo1k: Tempus2: no, thats a statement which uses a function call
22:10  gkatsev: Tempus2: a function expressions is something that is not a fnuction statement.
22:10  Sorella: but yeah, you posted the link here :3
22:10  Tempus2: Ah function expression :)
22:11  gkatsev: var foo = function(){} is a function expression.
22:11  Tempus2: I figured after he posted his evaluation
22:11  gkatsev: Sorella: lol, that was supposed to be friend's
22:11  EvanR-wo1k: thats a var declaration with no semi, using a function expression
22:11  Tempus2: That syntax is hard
22:11  yorick: gkatsev: I mean var assignments
22:11  yorick: (and declaration)
22:12  KenBW2: Can i use .push() to create a new named node to an array?
22:12  KenBW2: rather than just incrementing the [7]
22:12  gkatsev: KenBW2: named node on an array? what?
22:12  yorick: heh, 36/41 second time
22:12  gkatsev: KenBW2: you probably want just a regular js object
22:12  yorick: KenBW2: named node?
22:12  gkatsev: `====
22:12  jsBot: ====: yourObject.foobar is just another way of saying yourObject['foobar']. So of course if varName = 'foobar', then it's also the same as yourObject[varName]
22:13  Sorella: KenBW2 ≣ you should be aware that JavaScript has no associative arrays though...
22:13  Haxicar: Doing someArray.push({ key : value }); results in an array with "key" as the literal instead of being interpolated. Anyone tell me how to fix that?
22:13  yorick: KenBW2: arrays ARE regular js objects (with length getter/setter)
22:13 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
22:13  yorick: eh... gkatsev
22:13  KenBW2: well i have an array already, im trying to add a new node in in the form array["nodeName"], rather than array[7]
22:13  gkatsev: Haxicar: you are doing it wrong.
22:14  yorick: KenBW2: and why would you want to do that with push
22:14  gkatsev: KenBW2: you are doing it wrong
22:14  EvanR-wo1k: Haxicar: arrays dont have 'keys', they just used indexes
22:14  Sorella: KenBW2 ≣ you can't. JavaScript has no associative arrays.
22:14  gkatsev: Sorella: well, you can, but it's not right.
22:14  KenBW2: maybe i need to use a different method?
22:14  gkatsev: KenBW2: use javascript objects
22:14  yorick: EvanR-wo1k: other way aound...arrays don't have indexes, they just use keys
22:14  Haxicar: EvanR-wo1k, i want to push objects onto an array but the objects have "key" as their key instead of whatever key variable was filled with
22:14  EvanR-wo1k: screw array objects
22:15  gkatsev: EvanR-wo1k: arrays are objects internally.
22:15  Sorella: why use arrays when you have yield?
22:15  KenBW2: gkatsev: is that my only option?
22:15  EvanR-wo1k: Haxicar: o[x.k] = x
22:15  gkatsev: KenBW2: is that a bad thing?
22:15  EvanR-wo1k: gkatsev: sure they are
22:15  EvanR-wo1k: internally inside what
22:15  gkatsev: inside of js
22:16  EvanR-wo1k: what are arrays really makes no sense
22:16  Haxicar: EvanR-wo1k, I know I can do var obj = {}, obj[key] = value; someArray.push(obj), but that's ugly..can I do it in one expression?
22:16  EvanR-wo1k: so consider them to be exactly as you see them
22:16  gkatsev: Sorella: lol, yield. Only in furryfox
22:16  Sorella: :3
22:16  yorick: EvanR-wo1k: arrays are standard js objects, with a length getter/setter
22:16  EvanR-wo1k: Haxicar: yes, by defining a function to do that
22:17  gkatsev: yorick: they have a bit more magic to them than just getter/setter length
22:17  EvanR-wo1k: yorick: so its not internally at all, thats the language definition
22:17  EvanR-wo1k: not the implementation
22:17  yorick: gkatsev: like what?
22:17  gkatsev: the prototype functions?
22:17  gkatsev: slice, splice reverse etc
22:17  Sorella: well, length setter + numeric-index setter?
22:17  Sorella: numeric property*
22:17  yorick: gkatsev: you can argue those are plain js objects :P
22:18  gkatsev: yes, they can be applied on an object that you added a length property as well as getters/setters.
22:18  gkatsev: hence why it works on arguments array-like object
22:18  EvanR-wo1k: Haxicar: the push semantics imply something that does not exist, some sort of ordering of key value pairs. its not like php. an object is a set of named properties
22:18  EvanR-wo1k: not a sequence of named properties
22:19  Sorella: and sets have no guarantee of order
22:19  Sorella: you could get 1, 10, 2, 3, ... on a loop
22:19  Haxicar: EvanR-wo1k, well I guess var key = "foo"; var value = "bar"; var obj = { key : value }; doesn't work either right?
22:20  gkatsev: Haxicar: you'd want var obj = {}; obj[key] = value;
22:20  Haxicar: gkatsev, just sad I can't have an anonymous object (or whatever)
22:21  gkatsev: ?
22:21  Haxicar: gkatsev, someArray.push({ key : value }); vs defining a named object and pushing it onto the array
22:21  l4rk: Haxicar: that makes no sense
22:22  l4rk: if you push your named object it loses the name...
22:22  l4rk: you're passing the value
22:22  Haxicar: l4rk, i don't want a name... i want to do someArray.push({ key : value }); but then the object has literla "key"  as the key instead of the value of key
22:23  gkatsev: yeah, you can't do that
22:23  gkatsev: there is also no $_ here
22:23  gkatsev: :P
22:23 * Haxicar wants sigils
22:23  l4rk: oh wells
22:23  Haxicar: well at least i know there's no way. thanks guys.

22:27  ecto: k :)
22:27  elb0w: sort of a funny question, can I pass a function to another function?
22:27  JoelMcCracken: hey guys, is there a decent way get a  backtrace on a javascript error?
22:28  elb0w: I guess I would have to create a reference for it?
22:28  gkatsev: elb0w: sure, they are first class citizens
22:28  elb0w: and pass that
22:28  JoelMcCracken: elb0w: yes, you can
22:28  elb0w: cool
22:28  elb0w: never done that
22:28  elb0w: :)
22:28  gkatsev: elb0w: you just need to have a reference to it. See the hoisting rules of how/when you can refer to functions
22:28  elb0w: yeah

22:29  elb0w: yeah its all I use lately
22:29  JoelMcCracken: yeah though, backtrace on error?
22:29  JoelMcCracken: actually, is there a way to get a backtrace at all?
22:30  JoelMcCracken: or, access the stack?
22:31  GuySoft: ‎hey people, i am trying to get a callback function to call itself, but its not working, might anyone know how to solve this?
22:32  Wes: Maybe you forgot a semi-colon in line 7?
22:32  gkatsev: GuySoft: arguments.callee()
22:33  Avi`: some way to wrap javascript onto another line?
22:33  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, http://nopaste.dk/p2681
22:33  Avi`: lemme google it hold on
22:33  GuySoft: ‎whats callee??
22:33  gkatsev: Avi`: \ at the end of the line
22:33  gkatsev: GuySoft: the function you are in
22:33  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, im not sure what function i am in, because its a callback :-/
22:34  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, did you see the pastebin?
22:34  gkatsev: yeah, arguments.callee doesn't care about the sames
22:34  gkatsev: it refers to the function it is in
22:34  gkatsev: GuySoft: yes, but
22:34  gkatsev: `doesn't work
22:34  jsBot: doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
22:34  GuySoft: ‎so just stick there arguments.callee(container.value);
22:35  gkatsev: that should work but yours should also work
22:35  gkatsev: also, your word and rest are being declared globally since they are not declared with var
22:35  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, no, because its not in the scope
22:36  GuySoft: ‎rest is global, that should be ok,
22:36  gkatsev: GuySoft: oh, you want to recurse onto the function(result){...} rather than loadTranslation?
22:36  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, i want to recourse in to loadTranslation
22:36  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, i can explain the it from the top, it might help
22:36  nelabs: hi, is there javascript exercises on the web with solutions?
22:37  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, google has a service that does transliteration. but the API is an asymetric call, and it translates only one word at a time
22:37  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, so i wanted to make it recourse in to each new transliteration per-word

22:40  gkatsev: Xenc: best way of finding an object in an array is to loop through the array. If you know the array is sorted somehow, you can do a binary search or something
22:41  NoiseEee: otherwise just myJSON['myObj']['objProperty']
22:41  nelabs: thx gkatsev
22:41  Xenc: alright, thank you gkatsev
22:41  Xenc: NoiseEee: The problem there is there's no named link
22:41  Xenc: they're just object[i]
22:41  Xenc: object[i]['the_property_i_know'];
22:41  Avi`: gkatsev: that gave me a parse error
22:42  Avi`: if( blah == X || \
22:42  Avi`:  yo == "something" || \
22:42  Avi`: etc
22:43  gkatsev: Avi`: oh, you don't need the \ there.
22:43  joobie: guys this is my array http://pastebin.com/sKtbgT6L and this is my alert that im getting back "feedData.feed is undefined" alert('w00t' + feedData.feed[0].feedId); .. can anyone see what im doing wrong??
22:43  gkatsev: Avi`: it isn't python.
22:43  GuySoft: ‎hehe
22:43  Avi`: gkatsev: err.. I see, so the \ is only if i want t split a line on a non operating character
22:44  Avi`: like if( blah == "adff\
22:44  Avi`: asdf"
22:44  gkatsev: Avi`: or like a string or something yes
22:44  Avi`: i see, thanks
22:44  GuySoft: ‎i started this script in python, but then google blocked me because of multiple automated call, i infact it all working in python
22:45  joobie: GuySoft, you developing a google app for the online site?
22:45  GuySoft: ‎joobie, kida
22:45  GuySoft: ‎kinda*
22:45  joobie: how so?
22:45  GuySoft: ‎i am trying to mash too of their APIs together
22:45  joobie: ahh
22:45  joobie: what cha developing - if it aint top secret
22:46  GuySoft: .. and each time i manage to get it work, i find their API is obscure
22:49  GuySoft: ‎gkatsev, any idea what i could do - and if not, at least why its not working?
22:50  joobie: guys im doing alert('w00t' + feedData.feed[0].feedId); and getting back "feedData.feed is undefined" .. not sure how to reference the feedId properly in http://pastebin.com/sKtbgT6L .. any help appreciated
22:52  Tempus2: feedData.feed[0].feedId.value
22:53  Tempus2: I didn't look at your script, but I assume it has a value since you want to combine it with a string
22:53  Kai`: joobie: I was able to print feedData.feed[0].feedId with no problem
22:54  Kai`: Tempus2: its an object literal, feed is an array with one object
22:57  joobie: Kai`, ahh.. i see the problem, im using http://pastebin.com/xQ8iEvsQ which is overwriting feedData.. if i alert before that, it does work as you said
22:57  joobie: .. how can i extend the feedData array with that, raher than overwrite
22:58  joobie: ?
22:58  Tempus2: Yes it works for me too
22:58  Tempus2: It returned the value 3
22:59  unixSnob: how can I convert this url in to a normal one?  => https://application.capitalone.com/icoreapp/jsp/canadaCard/content/creditCardDisclosure.jsp
22:59  unixSnob: this javascript really gets on my nerves
22:59  unixSnob: I want to know the url that that leads to
22:59  unixSnob: my browser somehow decodes it, but wget cannot handle it
22:59  joobie: ya I think it definitely works, but later in the code i do http://pastebin.com/xQ8iEvsQ which is overwriting the feedData array.. instead i just wanted to "expand" the array, not overwrite
22:59  joobie: need help to do this :P
22:59  Kai`: joobie: feedData.feed.push({...}} too add another object to the array or feedData.feed[0].propertyname = vlaue
22:59  Kai`: brb
23:00  joobie: thanks Kai`
23:01 * GuySoft curses google's API and its asynchronous inferno
23:03  unixSnob: is javascript intended to prevent scraping?
23:03  joobie: Kai`I did feedData.push({.. }); and it said 'feedData.push is not a function' ?
23:03  Tempus2: prevent scraping?
23:03  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: No
23:04  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: JSON can be scraped fairly easily, for example.
23:04  Tempus2: what is scraping?
23:05  unixSnob: Tempus2: harvesting.. aka data mining
23:05  Tempus2: ah
23:05  unixSnob: Tempus2: I want to grab the html from a site, but can't because the links end in jsp
23:05  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Usually data is presented in a datagrid of somekind eventually, there are a few parsers avaliable for this. JavaScript just facilitates this, eventually it has to be some sort of visible HTML.
23:06  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: sounds like I need some kind of api or particular language
23:06  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: my program is simply written in bash, and uses wget
23:06  Tempus2: a server-side tool would do that easily
23:07  gkatsev: node.js ftw
23:07  Kinbote: hey anyone know of any good client-side js web scraper libs?
23:08  unixSnob: sometimes I can do a 'view source' and see what the real URL is, but at the moment i'm on a site that hides it pretty well
23:08  Tempus2: You mean the urls have to be evaluated?
23:08  gkatsev: see samy.pl and then hit view source
23:09  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: I use Agility Pack to do the parseing and then do xpath queries into the structure to grab the data, you can usually isolate the grid section of the page than iterate through the selected nodes to stuff data into your data object.
23:09  Tempus2: are you on client-side or server though?
23:10  joobie: guys http://pastebin.com/NAbNmCDk is returning "feedData.push is not a function" ? Any ideas why??
23:10  ExorcistToGo: I use TidyHTML to clean it up beforehand.
23:10  ExorcistToGo: This is just one way to do it.
23:11  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: There are all sorts of ways to do this sort of stuff.
23:11  unixSnob: Tempus2: i'm a client, just using wget, and a shell script
23:12  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: i've already coded a parser in bash, so all i need is a way to get urls.  what you're talking about seems quite complicated
23:13  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: There is an html parser for python.
23:13  joobie: unixSnob, call wget
23:13  joobie: if you are using bash for this
23:13  unixSnob: well it's not the html parsing that's stopping me... it's getting the real URL to get the data from
23:13  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Gotcha.
23:14  unixSnob: joobie: that doesn't work on URLs ending in jsp
23:14  joobie: isnt jsp serverside?
23:14  unixSnob: this just gives me some javascript => wget -O - 'https://application.capitalone.com/icoreapp/jsp/canadaCard/content/creditCardDisclosure.jsp'
23:15  Kai`: joobie: re: you weren't pushing on the array, feed[0] is an array -- feedData.feed[0].push
23:15  leonL: I've made a little script work, but I don't know why it works :)
23:15  Tempus2: lol
23:15  joobie: Kai`, I want this to be feedDatat.constraints, rather than overwrite feedData.feed
23:16  joobie: they are two different logical containers
23:16  Kai`: lemme look at link again
23:16  leonL: I have an AJAX call that inserts a new OPTION element inside a SELECT drop down
23:16  joobie: http://pastebin.com/NAbNmCDk
23:16  joobie: thanks :)
23:16  joobie: unixSnob, wget will work
23:17  Kai`: joobie: you can only call push on an array
23:17  Kai`: joobie: you can simple do feedData.constraints = ...
23:17  Kai`: s/simple/simply
23:17  leonL: if I have a nodelist of all the OPTION elements it doesn't take the new one into consideration unless I wrap the call to it in a setTimeout
23:17  joobie: ahhhh
23:17  leonL: what's that about?
23:17  joobie: i think that is my prob Kai` because before i was doing feedData = { constraints ..
23:18  Kai`: :D
23:18  joobie: which was overwriting
23:18  Tempus2: a "nodelist" as in the form of an array?
23:18  joobie: sec ill try - thanks :)
23:18  leonL: Tempus2: yes
23:18  Kai`: leonL: its not a live list
23:18  joobie: bingo
23:19  joobie: thanks Kai
23:19  Kai`: np
23:19  Tempus2: well if you use the array, you must make sure the option is added to this nodelist as well as excisting in the DOM
23:19  leonL: then how come I can use it to grab the new element if I do it after a timeout (and a 1 milisec timeout at that).
23:19  unixSnob: joobie: sure, once I have the URL it will work, but wget does not know how to execute javascript, and get the real URL
23:20  Kai`: leonL: how are you creating the list of nodes?
23:20  unixSnob: joobie: wget just spits out javascript, literally.
23:20  leonL: anyway, the nodelist is not essential to the question, I notice the same problem however I try to grab the new element (getElementById etc.)
23:20  joobie: wget just pulls down the website src
23:20  Tempus2: leonL, there's too little information to actually see your problem
23:20  unixSnob: joobie: right, but it won't get you the url
23:21  joobie: i dont know what you mean by get you the url
23:21  unixSnob: joobie: run wget -O - 'https://application.capitalone.com/icoreapp/jsp/canadaCard/content/creditCardDisclosure.jsp'
23:21  Kai`: leonL: if you are creating new DOM elements on the fly, you already have a reference to them -- why are you searching for them again?
23:21  unixSnob: joobie: you'll see what I mean when you run that
23:21  joobie: when you goto that page, there is no redirect happening
23:21  joobie: i dont have wget locally
23:21  Tempus2: the webpage he queries return javascript that needs to be evaluated in order to make the proper link, joobie
23:22  Kai`: I prob just don't understand what exactly is going on @ leonL
23:22  joobie: but i go to that page, with javascript enabled, and it doesnt redirect me via JS
23:22  Tempus2: no but the link is generated by javascript
23:23  leonL: perhaps I was off the mark when I said 'little' script; I can appreciate this is hard to see.
23:23  Tempus2: It isn't a redirect, it's a link
23:23  Kai`: curl https://application.capitalone.com/icoreapp/jsp/canadaCard/content/creditCardDisclosure.jsp
23:23  leonL: thanks anyway
23:23  unixSnob: capitalone.ca actually has several credit cards with different terms, but they all use the link https://application.capitalone.com/icoreapp/jsp/canadaCard/content/creditCardDisclosure.jsp
23:23  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: https://www.capitalone.ca/scripts/https-canada/null.js?Log=1&AppName=ICORE&Referrer=unreferred&PageName=creditCardDisclosure&PreviousPage=undefined&Sol=undefined&TestCell=undefined&SellPage=undefined&Vendor=ISWG&CreditAppId=undefined&CountryCode=CA
23:23  joobie: .. so just pull the src down with wget
23:24  joobie: and rationalize the JS within the src via code
23:24  Kai`: unixSnob: its a jsp file -- you only see what the backend decides to show you
23:24  nvictor: hey
23:25  Kai`: leonL: you're creating new elements and then you want to keep track of them?
23:25  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: i think you're on to something.. but that's just a blank page to me
23:26  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Same here, but it is what happens befind the scenes.
23:26  ExorcistToGo: behind that is
23:26  unixSnob: Kai`: is the backend keeping track of which card i last looked at, and showing the applicable page?
23:27  Kai`: unixSnob: it can if its keeping track of your session
23:27  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: i suspect it might be a matter if discovering the parameters in that URL you posted
23:28  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: how do I find out what was in the "undefined" parameters?
23:28  Tempus2: look at the script?
23:29  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Use something like TamperData and you can see all the requests that happen.
23:30  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: hmm.. not sure what that is, but I have tcpdump.. that might work
23:30  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: you mean packet sniffing, right?
23:31  unixSnob: Tempus2: when I view source, the attributes are also undefined
23:31  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Mozilla with Firebug and TamperData is what I use.
23:31  Tempus2: Yes I see, I tried
23:31  ExorcistToGo: and a few other tools
23:31  Tempus2: sounded more like acutal requests than package sniffing :P
23:32  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: TamperData is an add on for Mozilla.
23:32  Tempus2: although the requests are packages too
23:32  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: thanks, i'll check it out
23:32  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: It does not show everything that happens, but it is 99.9% of what one needs
23:33  ExorcistToGo: It gives you the details of all http and https requests.
23:33  ExorcistToGo: That happen when you go to that jsp page
23:33  Tempus2: Sounds cool
23:34  Tempus2: It would be useful for debug on my own page I think
23:34  unixSnob: tamperdata needs a late version of firefox
23:34  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Correct
23:37  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: I use Firebug, TamperData, and an assortment of profiler tools all the time. Firebug gives you some visibility into what is going on usually.
23:37  Tempus2: TamperData rocks mate
23:37  Tempus2: Thanks!
23:37  Tempus2: Great for debugging
23:37  Tempus2: And cleaning..!
23:39  Tempus2: what is Host=safebrowsing-cache.google.com ??
23:39  ExorcistToGo: :)
23:39  Tempus2: It does requests even if I don't have google.com in any of tabs
23:40  ExorcistToGo: Tempus: You find out all sorts of stuff using these tools. Heh
23:40  ExorcistToGo: Have fun.
23:40  Tempus2: Oo
23:41  unixSnob: just got it installed on a vm with a more current firefox... looks like a great tool
23:41  ExorcistToGo:  8  down vote accepted
23:41  ExorcistToGo: 	
23:41  ExorcistToGo: Safe Browsing is a service from Google that helps fighting the spam and phishing sites by blocking them in the browser.
23:41  ExorcistToGo: When you go to a site, it's checked by Google. If it's returned as problematic, you get a warning in the browser.
23:41  ExorcistToGo: Sorry for the spammy post
23:42  Tempus2: ah so FF does this intentionally?
23:42  Tempus2: Thanks... I was starting to worry
23:42  Tempus2: going communicating with FF without google being any of the pages kind of set me out
23:42  Tempus2: google communicating*
23:43  ExorcistToGo: Tempus2: It will be interesting to see everything that happens on pages.
23:43  ExorcistToGo: For awhile at least.
23:43  Tempus2: Well it already told me about a few flaws I have on my page
23:43  Tempus2: First one was a missing favicon.ico
23:44  Tempus2: Simple but I didn't know heh
23:45  unixSnob: wow.. so google knows where all their users visit, even if it was not clicked from a google search... scary.  I would rather not have googles "protection"
23:46  ExorcistToGo: Tempus2: You can configure the Connection Settings in Firefix to change that.
23:46  ExorcistToGo: I believe if it is set to No Proxy it will not use that.
23:47  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: There are hidden features in Firefox :)
23:49  unixSnob: ExorcistToGo: i'm a bit surprized.. I figured it's opensource, so it's under close watch, particularly as popular as it is
23:52  ExorcistToGo: unixSnob: Small correction, you can turn it off in security tab, I have it turned off because it interfers with my analysis of a site.
23:52  Gregor: ...
23:52  Gregor: That's not a hidden feature at all.
23:52  Gregor: It was in fact quite greatly advertised and lauded when it first came out.
23:53  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: I agree. I did not mean to imply anything underhanded. Lots of folks are still surprised by this though.
23:53  unixSnob: it's a good feature, but my concern is adding to the monolithic data pile at google, inc.
23:53  unixSnob: does one company have to know everything?
23:53  Gregor: unixSnob: LOVE THE GOOGLE. THE GOOGLE IS HERE TO PROTECT YOU. GIVE YOUR DATA AND SOUL TO THE GOOGLE. THE GOOGLE WILL PROTECT US.
23:54  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: I love it personally.
23:54  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: Do No Evil!
23:55 --- blackwhite_ is now known as blackwhite
23:56  Tempus2: The google is here to make money
23:56  Tempus2: Belive otherwise and fail
23:57  ExorcistToGo: Microsoft needs to add Google's safe browing to IE :)
23:57  MikeD_: what's the recommended best way to add an option to the top of a select list?
23:57  carlocci: it's the only corporation that deserves the money it makes
23:57  carlocci: and it's the only corporation whose marketing I bought into
23:58  carlocci: sadly
23:59  ExorcistToGo: Gregor: What do you know about Points-to analysis for javascript and Binary Decision Diagrams. I am looking at the source code for V8 to see if can use parts of the code to help construct BDD analysis of JavaScript.
