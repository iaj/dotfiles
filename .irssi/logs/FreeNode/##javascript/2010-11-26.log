00:24  Wes-: does anybody out there have a good minifier written IN javascript?
00:26  joeytwiddle: dshap: can't you attack onload event to a new Image()?  i usually do document.createElement("img") just because that's how i create all other elements
00:28  yonixxx: sorry for very trival question, i'm looking for a nice free repo of javascript.
00:33 --- riven` is now known as riven
00:36  Wes-: repo?
00:36  yonixxx: repository... all what i found on google is crap
00:38  naiad: when assigning event handlers inside an object, is it bad practice to set a refernce of the object to say var self = this;, and then when assigning the event handler using handlerMethod.apply() with self ?
00:40  Wes-: yonixxx: ..... the repository for the javascript engine in firefox can be found at http://hg.mozilla.org/tracemonkey, in the js/src directory
00:40  Wes-: what exactly are you trying to do?
00:41  yonixxx: i'm looking for a very simple text ticker and to display the date on an html page.
00:41  Wes-: naiad: questions - is it clear? is it ambiguous? does it entrain extra objects?
00:41  Wes-: naiad: If yes, no, no then IMHO is it is fine
00:41  Wes-: yonixxx: OH
00:42  Wes-: yonixxx: Can't help you there, but google probably can :)
00:43  yonixxx: Wes- well...it should, but so far i have visited something like 30 websites... 404, not "really" free, etc... I thought i'll find this is 3 clicks. :)
00:44  Wes-: yonixxx: <script>document.write(new Date())</script> ?
00:45 * Wes- is not a fancy GUI guy
00:45  j82: anyone know of any good xss/html filtering library implemented in javascript?
00:45  yonixxx: if it works it is good for me :) i don;t know javascript
00:46  Wes-: yonixxx: Obviously I didn't test that, but if you stick it in an HTML document, it should print the user's computer's time right there on the page
00:48  yonixxx: hey it works great as simply as it is ! :D... heu... i guess it will be something more complicated to set the format so it shows just "Friday 26 November 2010" :)
00:51  Wes-: yonixxx: Yes - you could write a short javascript program to do that
00:51  Wes-: yonixxx: instead of document.write(new Date()) you could do something like
00:51  Wes-: var now = new Date();
00:52  Wes-: document.write('the date is ' + now.getThis + ", " + now.getThat + "etc")
00:52  Wes-: yonixxx: you can read all about what you can with the date object at
00:52  Wes-: `js ref Date
00:52  jsBot: js ref Date: Date object: Creates Date instances which let you work with dates and times. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date
00:52  yonixxx: tks, searching google with "var d=new Date();" is already getting better results
00:57  andru: anyone will to help a new user with a small problem I just can't eem to get my head around?
01:11  KeyboardWarrior: Slightly offtopic, but should I do this? http://usercloud.signapdf.com/site/landingpage.php
01:11  KeyboardWarrior: I'm currently making a jquery plugin for it
01:14  scutum: quick question, here at http://www.farilist.com/USA.inc.php I would like it so all other states will disappear after the user clicks of the state
01:15  scutum: here is the function when the user clicks
01:16  scutum:   $('#menu li a').click(
01:16  scutum:       function() {
01:16  scutum:         $(this).next().slideToggle('normal');	
01:16  scutum: 			  }
01:16  KeyboardWarrior: yay jquery
01:16  scutum: :D
01:17  scutum: here is what I thought
01:17  scutum: $(this).parent().siblings().find('li').fadeOut();
01:17  scutum: but wont do it
01:19  scutum: not sure what Im doing wrong :(
01:19  KeyboardWarrior: try #jquery
01:20  scutum: ok
01:48  lifechamp: can javascript know in which script file it is operating? or only the url, or what?
01:48  lifechamp: err. nvm.. it's client side, client doesn't know which php script served it up right
01:49  lifechamp: even if there was an htaccess redirect from url to php processing, doesn't mean anything to the js, right?
01:49  lifechamp: (so i'm safe putting up adsense on my redirected pages?)
01:52  randomOfAmber: if I wanted to use a dictionary (for tagging words with their parts of speech) in javascript, what would I use?
01:52  GeO`: hi
01:52  GeO`: what is Javascript parse error, unexpected: RPAREN ?
01:52  randomOfAmber: is there a javacsript solution? or would I be better off running something through a server (php or something), then just making ajax calls to it?
01:53  preaction: GeO`: sounds like your parser expected something but got a right parenthesis
01:53  GeO`: ah it stands for right parenthesis...
01:53  GeO`: Ill search for it
01:56  GeO`: found it, thx
02:18  quiak: Quick question, did anyone here lose internet connection within the last 15 minutes?
02:20  quiak: Ok well I'll take that as a no.
02:25  Wes-: ...unless we ALL did and you're the first one back!
02:36  Baxnie: how can i use sockets with js?
02:41  KeyboardWarrior: Yes!
02:41  KeyboardWarrior: Baxnie: Websockets :)
02:42  Baxnie: KeyboardWarrior: i was looking at it
02:42  Baxnie: but i dont want to use WS protocol ;/
02:42  KeyboardWarrior: It won't work in current browsers quite yet though
02:42  Baxnie: i want no protocol, just send bytes
02:42  Baxnie: works with chrome
02:43  Baxnie: the thing is, i want to connect to any server, not only those who are expecting connections from WebSocket
02:45  Baxnie: KeyboardWarrior: for an easy understanding, i'd like to connect to WoW for example.
02:45  Baxnie: is it possible with websockets?
02:47  KeyboardWarrior: dunno
02:47  KeyboardWarrior: Anyone know?
02:48  Baxnie: KeyboardWarrior: something i cant understand is why they give high level coding options and dont give low ;/
02:49  KeyboardWarrior: Baxnie: For security.
02:50  Baxnie: ye, but its quita strange, a browser that can't connect using sockets properly ;/
02:50  KeyboardWarrior: Baxnie, I'm making this: http://usercloud.signapdf.com/site/landingpage.php
02:51  Baxnie: seems cool =]
02:52  KeyboardWarrior: Baxnie: There was an exploit a while back where someone was able to POST data to port 6667 on Freenode well enough to get into a channel and flood
02:52  KeyboardWarrior: Anyone that clicked got insta-klined
02:52  Baxnie: =p
02:55  Baxnie: KeyboardWarrior: u might be interested
02:55  Baxnie: In addition to the new Web Sockets API, there is also a new protocol (the "web socket protocol") that the browser uses to communicate with servers. The protocol is not raw TCP because it needs to provide the browser's "same-origin" security model. It's also not HTTP because web socket traffic differers from HTTP's request-response model.
02:55  KeyboardWarrior: Yeah, it's going to be a boon for web apps :)
02:56  Baxnie: KeyboardWarrior: canvas and websockets
02:56  Baxnie: lovely
03:00  wkmanire: Howdy folks.

03:11  RiaGuy: How to find out a cellspacing/cellpadding values of a <table>?
03:12  KeyboardWarrior: RiaGuy: Get the attribute?
03:13  RiaGuy: table.cellPadding, table.cellSpacing return an empty string
03:14  RiaGuy: they are not explicitely defined, attrubutes are not set
03:14  j82: anyone know what's the best way to clean raw html from arbitrary pages using javascript? library/function recommendations?
03:15  j82: (like removing script tags xss attacks etc..)
03:15  wkmanire: RiaGuy: shouldn't it be table.getAttribute('cellpadding') etc...?
03:16  RiaGuy: table.getAttribute('cellpadding') returns null
03:16  wkmanire: RiaGuy: Does the table have a cellpadding attribute defined?
03:16  RiaGuy: it doesn't
03:16  wkmanire: :)
03:16  wkmanire: What are you trying to do?
03:17  RiaGuy: calculate the height of a row (<tr>)
03:17  preaction: RiaGuy: why not clientHeight?
03:18  RiaGuy: with this row height i can set height on a container (tr height & tr count)
03:18  RiaGuy: and allow users to scroll the container even if not all tr rows has been inserted yet
03:27  jm2: Hi
03:28  jm2: hi, I am trying to write a callback function,      $('#blah').click(function() { alert(this.pollId); } ) <--- I would like to use the this.pollId from the scope of this line
03:28  jm2: how can I do so?
03:36  systemfault: var that = this;  $('#blah').click(function() { alert(that.pollId); } )
03:38  jm2: oh
03:38  jm2: thanks
03:38  systemfault: You're welcome
03:40  jm2: :) perfect
03:43  lonimurar: is it possible to validly (xhtml 1.1) use <script> elements in <body>?
03:44  lonimurar: validator complains about '>' and '&', for example
03:52  Aleoss: loni: Because < should be &lt; and > should be &gt; and & should be &amp;
03:52  Aleoss: loni: You can put JS in the body.
03:53  Aleoss: loni: I recommend you put all JS into a .JS file and <script> link it with the src attribute.
04:05  lonimurar: Aleoss: but I can't do that in the body, can I?
04:10  Seus: why is it that 'this' on an onclick event on a div tag, refers to the window rather than the div tag itself?
04:13  KeyboardWarrior: Seus: Because you're trying to do this in IE?
04:13  Seus: FF
04:13  Seus: i know that if i call the onclick function as function(this) it works ok
04:14  Seus: but find it odd that if i just want a function without any params, and call the function with onclick it doesn't access that object with 'this' it access' the window
04:15  KeyboardWarrior: Seus, right. You have to pass this from onclick or it won't work
04:16  Seus: i guess i'm too used to programming in Java
04:16  KeyboardWarrior: :D
04:17  joo: But this is a Java channel
04:17  joo: it's obviously about scripting in Java
04:17  joo: "Java Script"
04:18  Seus: javascript != java
04:18  joo: Seus, how much would you bet?
04:18  Seus: i know enough to know that it isn't java
04:18 --- ben_alman_ is now known as ben_alman
04:18  joo: hmm but can you ever truly know something?
04:19  Seus: yes i can
04:19  joo: Give me an example
04:20  Seus: easy
04:20  Seus: Java allows overloading methods
04:20  Seus: Javascript does not
04:20  Seus: done
04:20  Seus: yes you can write some special class to mimic it
04:20  Seus: but it's not built into it
04:21  joo: You haven't proved that you truly know that
04:21  joo: You just stated it
04:21  Seus: do you know what overloading is?
04:22  Seus: because if so, you wouldn't be asking for examples
04:22  Seus: here i'll help you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading
04:24 * joo is still waiting for a logical proof of how that knowledge is undeniable
04:25  systemfault: joo: He's right, get lost... troll
04:25  systemfault: You can only emulate it with the "arguments" pseudo-array
04:26  Seus: thank you systemfault
04:27  Seus: shoulda brought my troll spray tonight
04:27  joo: systemfault, are you sure I'm trolling? Because you sound kind of uncertain.
04:27  joo: If I were a troll you should just ignore me, and not continue arguing.
04:27  systemfault: Why?
04:28  joo: Because to argue with a troll is pointless.
04:29  joo: Unless you're also a troll.
04:29  joo: In which case, let there be wine and merriment.
04:32  j0hng4lt: does it make sense to use javascript as a general-purpose embedded scripting language (i.e. like Lua)?
04:32  systemfault: j0hng4lt: Yes, sure, v8 ftw
04:32  systemfault: j0hng4lt: It will probably become more common in the next few years
04:35  j0hng4lt: j0hng4lt: I'm not sure as to which engine I'll end up using. I'm using C#, so I have to choose between Jint (an interpreter), IronJS (a DLR compiler) and Javascript.NET (V8 wrapped in managed C++)
04:36  j0hng4lt: but it's too early in the game for me to make that decision. For what I'm doing scriptability is more of a nice-to-have
04:36  systemfault: Of those 3, I only know V8
04:40  j0hng4lt: systemfault: JavaScript would play the same role in the app as VBA in Excel (i.e. to allow  advanced developer-users to add a bit of functionality without modifying the app)
04:49  lonimurar: is it possible to validly (xhtml 1.1) use <script> elements in <body>?
04:49  lonimurar: validator complains about '>' and '&', for example
05:05  themiddleman: lonimurar: 1. dont use inline scripts (recommended) 2. ignore it 2. wrap in CDATA tags
05:05  themiddleman: `g cdata tags

05:06 --- wasabist_ is now known as wasabist
05:06  themiddleman: inline scripts?  I hardly ever use them
05:07  lonimurar: like jquery stuff
05:07  themiddleman: just put it all in 1 js file and link it at the bottom of the body
05:08  lonimurar: oh you can do that?
05:08  lonimurar: I thought you can only use src in the <head>
05:08  themiddleman: oh yeah!
05:09  themiddleman: no
05:09  lonimurar: neat
05:09  lonimurar: why at the bottom of the body?
05:09  themiddleman: its best to put scripts at the bottom of the body since they block html from rendering
05:09  themiddleman: but keep css in the head

10:23  j82: is there a cross-browser'ish method of calling a java jar from javascript?
10:26  cthmpsys: is it possible to for example. I have 2 users browsing a javascript page with a table connected to a sql server and user 1 updates the table then user 2 see the updated table without refreshing the page. and have like a mutex and an event handling this?
10:27  j82: cthmpsys: you might use ajax or JSONP to call to your server from the running javascript in the page every 5 seconds or so
10:27  j82: and check if something has changed, then send the delta
10:28  cthmpsys: thanks for the answear, but is that the only way? it doesn't seem safe. if they change at the same time etc..
10:29  j82: hm, if they change at the same time, it's no biggie, because you're just sending the changes
10:29  cthmpsys: or if the are modifying the same table, I want the table to get "locked" when a user is modifying it
10:29  j82: hm
10:29  cthmpsys: j82: but if the move the same row or something like that
10:30  cthmpsys: *they
10:30  j82: what I would do, is implement some state-detection code server side
10:31  cthmpsys: sounds like a good idea, but can you go into details a bit more?
10:31  j82: for example, if one user sends a command to change x to y, but x is not where this user thought it was initially on their client cause they hadn't updated yet.. then you send back an error message+update state of their table; and say in the error message they need to try their change to the table or whatever it may be again
10:32  cthmpsys: j82:  can javascript do this?
10:32  j82: so when it fails, two things happen, they get an updated state, and secondly they get the error message that they need to try again, because server-side it was detected that something was out of place when trying to insert the change they just tried
10:33  cthmpsys: or mysql?
10:33  j82: javascript can facilitate communication and updating the table client-side (in the web page running on the user's browser), then you need to program the server to work with the client
10:34  cthmpsys: maybe the simplest solution is to use a update every second, thanks for the help j82
10:35  dobalina: anyone know how to track IP clicks on people clicking on google adsense ads ? (considering google adsense is purely a piece of javascript code and everything hosted by google web sserverss)
10:35  cthmpsys: like you said in your first answear
10:35  j82: sure np (but you definitely don't want a 1 second update scheme, it taxes the server too much; most people get away with 1 minute updates; even gmail etc..)
10:36  cthmpsys: yeah but it's like 10 people that will update the tables simultaneously so I don't think the server load will be to much
10:37  wabznasm: cthmpsys: i've come in halfway through this, but long-polling any good here? Comet?
10:37  cthmpsys: if there just was simple mutex and event solution to this....
10:38  j82: na mutex is if you're running under the same kernel, or a distributed system designed to handle mutex's explicitly
10:38  cthmpsys: wabznasm: the problem is that I only can access the database on the server
10:38  j82: you're dealing with old-fashioned REST calls
10:39  cthmpsys: j82: yeah I know, I meant something simular.
10:40  cthmpsys: I still think I am going to have to take care of a lot of error handling
10:42  j82: if it were me, the main thing that I'd make sure to code properly, is making sure that when a client sends an update to the table, that update is accompanied with what they think they're updating, and where they think they're updating it
10:42  j82: and then you could add the changes they're making to a log, including what person did the updating
10:42  j82: similar to google docs
10:42  j82: (when collaboratively editing)
10:43  j82: (so if stuff doesn't match you throw back the error)
10:43  cthmpsys: sounds like a good idea
10:44  cthmpsys: thanks for all the help, I appreciate it!
10:44  j82: sure np
10:53  cthmpsys: j82: maybe I can have a sql table for looking the main tables, so I always check that value when I try to modify it on client side

11:57  clu3: hi all, I have a js object from a .swf file, called red5phone, can i list all of its methods using js? I know from sample code that it has red5phone.dial(number), but i'm trying to look for a hangup function
11:59  Cork: clu3: console.log(red5phone) then inspect it in your debug toolbar
11:59  Cork: (firebug, or the console from chrome, opera and so on)
12:00  clu3: Cork, thanks, when console.log, it just gives the embed HTML element
12:01  clu3: <embed id="red5phone" align="middle" height="262" width="266" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" name="red5phone" bgcolor="#869ca7" quality="high" src="red5phone.swf">
12:01  Cork: clu3: then its not a js object, but a dom element
12:01  clu3: Cork, the red5phone object is gotten from a .swf file. I'm not familiar with js + flash interaction
12:01  Cork: click the element and check if its listed there
12:01  Cork: (in the console tab)
12:02  clu3: Cork, yep, it's there . The thing is in js , there's a call red5phone.dial(a number) and it already works. I can activate a call through js already
12:03  Cork: clue: i meant if you inspect the dom element you should be abot to find function members
12:03  Cork: abot==able
12:03  phao: Hi. Which is a good website with resources about javascript, mainly current implementations for use outside web?
12:04  clu3: Cordk, it's an embedded flash, how do i inspect it? i can only see HTML from firebug
12:04  clu3: Cork, ^^
12:05  Cork: clu3: as i said, do consol.log on the element, then in the console click the output, you should end up on the dom tab with a list of its members
12:11  BW^-: did you guys every hear of such a thing as problems with changing the expiry date of a cookie?
12:12  preaction: no, is that anything like people who ask their real question up front?
12:15  clu3: Cork, when i switch to DOM tab, it seems to list all the methods for Window object, rather than that specific red5phone object
12:19  Cork: clu3: did you click the <embed id="red5phone" align="middle"... output in the console?
12:19  clu3: Cork, yep
12:19  BW^-: preaction: :) i have exactly this question, debugging, strange.
12:19  Cork: clu3: wierd...
12:19  clu3: Cork, seems like it does not recognize the methods/properties in the DOM tab, for that obj
12:19  preaction: BW^-: no, your real question is: "I'm trying to do <code> to set expiration of a cookie, but <something happens>. Here's the URL to my test case: <url here>"
12:20  SolarBoom: how to check style.left is not contains any value?
12:20  preaction: if ( !style.left )
12:20  preaction: `false
12:20  jsBot: false: Things that evaluate to false in JS: null, undefined, boolean-false, zero (when it's a number -- the string '0' is true), empty string, NaN
12:21  SolarBoom: or if (parsenInt(style.left === "NaN")), hm?
12:21  preaction: probably not
12:21  SolarBoom: logically it must work, but it doesn't work
12:22  SolarBoom: because parseInt(style.left) => NaN
12:22 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
12:23  preaction: no, not logically. if you want to know if it's NaN, use isNaN
12:24  SolarBoom: preaction: okay, I'll try it, thanks! :)
12:24  preaction: SolarBoom: or you could use what I said in the first place.
12:26  SolarBoom: very good, finally I solved my problem, it worrrksss! ;-)

12:44  eboyjr: Is it slow to search through the prototype chain for an object property?
12:44  eboyjr: How is it usually implemented?
12:45  TheSheep: eboyjr: there are many tricky optimizations, different engines do it differently, for example v8 caches a lot of the info as pseudo-classes
12:46  erry: Can i find how far from the start of the page an elem is if it doesn't have a style.top?
12:47  TheSheep: erry: yes, there are the offsets that give you real position
12:48  erry: oofsetTop ?
12:48  erry: and offsetLeft?
12:48  erry: off*
12:48  TheSheep: I think so, I can't remember off the top of my head, also jQuery has some wrapping functons for it
12:49  eboyjr: TheSheep: That's good I'm glad v8 is smart about it
12:49  TheSheep: I think different browsers have different of those properties and also calculate them differently

But this don't work with this dynamic calendar: dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex7/jasoncalendar.htm - So, how can I set variable alias to data[main][c_valid] this?  This calendar input don't handle the data[main][c_valid] variable format. What is the solution? Thanks.  If I use it...
12:54  VakaVaka: ...with examplevar , not data[main][c_valid] it works also.

13:10  wecing: hello everyone. how could i remove a image which has no id?
13:11  eMyller: wecing: by which criteria could you find this image?
13:11  SolarBoom: How to continuously use setTimeout()?
13:12  eMyller: SolarBoom: use setInterval or use a callback that calls itself with a setTimeout within..
13:13  SolarBoom: eMyller: callback? how to use it?
13:13  eMyller: SolarBoom: callback = function
13:13  eMyller: `mdc @ SolarBoom
13:13  jsBot: SolarBoom: mdc: Mozilla Developer Center: http://developer.mozilla.org/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript
13:13  eMyller: read more info there ;)
13:13  SolarBoom: okay
13:13  SolarBoom: this resoursce so big ;-)
13:14  wecing: eMyller: unfortunately, that's exactly the problem. see this: http://code.bulix.org/ztais4-78866
13:16  wecing: eMyller: however, document.getElementsByTagName('img') may work, but i don't like this way because the website may change.
13:17  eboyjr: Use an id
13:17  eboyjr: Oh..
13:17  wecing: no id...
13:17  SolarBoom: Whoaa! I can't stop it. It running. Hey stop please! :-D
13:17  eboyjr: Why cant you put one?
13:18  wecing: eboyjr: because that's not my own website.
13:18  eMyller: wecing: you can find elements by any criteria
13:18  eboyjr: wecing: Oh okay, you can loop through getElementsByTagName('img') and check the src attribute?
13:18  wecing: eboyjr: the image is annoying, so i tried to use javascript to remove it.
13:18  eMyller: why don't you use the href/src attribute to filter out?
13:18  eboyjr: What's unique about this image you want to remove?
13:19  eMyller: like what eboyjr said.
13:19  eMyller: SolarBoom: big and really useful.
13:19  SolarBoom: EMyller: Yea
13:20  wecing: nothing unique... but the image link.
13:20  eMyller: use it, then.
13:21  wecing: eMyller: but... how? I mean, which function should i use to find it?
13:22  eMyller: wecing: do what eboyjr said
13:22  eMyller: loop - filter
13:22  VakaVaka: eMyller: thanks, I will check it.
13:23  eMyller: VakaVaka: let me know if you want the sources, i don't have them published in a package.
13:23  wecing: eMyller: ahh... i'm new to javascript, so... I will use google. thanks.
13:23  eMyller: wecing: use google to find a solution based on what we said?
13:24  wecing: eMyller: what filter is, and how to use it.

13:25  VakaVaka: eMyller: I no need new calendar actually, just need to make javascript alias data[main][c_valid] to normal variable. So, how can I set variable alias to data[main][c_valid] this?
13:25  eMyller: for (var all = document.getElementsByTagName('img'), l = all.length, i = 0; i < l; i++) if (all[i].src.indexOf("foo bar") !== -1) { ...
13:25  eMyller: wecing: pick one. :P
13:26  wecing: eboyjr: you so cute... but try to use code.bulix.org next time, lol~
13:26  eboyjr: mine has a syntax error though
13:26  wecing: eMyller: thanks~
13:26  Maxdamantus: eboyjr's one is going to replace all image sources.
13:26  wecing: eboyjr: i will fix it~
13:26  eboyjr: wecing: whats that? and why am i cute?
13:26  eboyjr: lol
13:26  Maxdamantus: But it'll also hide them all.
13:26  SolarBoom: eMyller: How to stop setInterval() at any value?
13:26  wecing: lol
13:27  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: Yeah the = heh
13:27  eMyller: SolarBoom: clearInterval. it's on MDC.
13:28  eboyjr: SolarBoom: I have a habit to never use setInterval... only setTimeout.
13:28  Maxdamantus: I think setInterval is non-standard.
13:28  Maxdamantus: Which makes you wonder how it's implemented.
13:28  Maxdamantus: Will it lock up the browser if the interval is too low, and your computation takes too long?
13:29  SolarBoom: eboyjr: how you're using setTimeout() continuously?
13:29  eboyjr: SolarBoom: I call the function recursively inside the setTimeout function
13:29  eboyjr: actually..
13:29  Maxdamantus: eboyjr: why do you do that?
13:29  SolarBoom: eboyjr: How, can you please write?
13:30  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: So it will perform better on slow machines, and it wont lock up
13:30  eboyjr: SolarBoom: yes hold on
13:30  Maxdamantus: eboyjr: you mean you pass it to setTimeout?
13:30  Maxdamantus: (Rather than calling it recursively)
13:31  eboyjr: var dothis = function() { alert("hey"); setTimeout(dothis, 300); }; dothis();
13:31  eboyjr: or
13:31  eboyjr: (function() { alert("hey"); setTimeout(aruments.callee, 300); })();
13:32  eboyjr: When you use setTimeout, it pauses execution of the other scripts while it is being run
13:32  eboyjr: So it simulates threading
13:32  Maxdamantus: Pauses?
13:32  eboyjr: Halts
13:33  Maxdamantus: There's only one context ever running at a time on a page.
13:34  eboyjr: Yeah that's why it has to stop the other context
13:34  Maxdamantus: (Disregarding web workers - I dunno about them)
13:34  Maxdamantus: It doesn't stop the other context.
13:34  Maxdamantus: It just doesn't run until no contexts are running.
13:34  eboyjr: Put an infinite loop in a setTimeout and see
13:34 * eboyjr tries
13:35  Maxdamantus: It'll just lock up the page and nothing else will run.
13:35  Maxdamantus: It doesn't run two pieces of code in parallel.
13:36  eboyjr: holy crap it crashed my window manager
13:36  SolarBoom: eboyjr: and how to stop it?
13:36  SolarBoom: eboyjr: It has locked my browser, I have to kill firefox.exe
13:36  eboyjr: SolarBoom: Set a variable iWantThisStopped = true; then inside dothis, if( !iWantThisStopped ) setTimeout(arguments.callee, 300);
13:37  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: That's what I mean by locking the page
13:37  eboyjr: the page and the scripts run in the same process
13:37  Maxdamantus: The page is locked because the one context is busy.
13:38  SolarBoom: eboyjr: if I wanna do it 5 times?
13:38  Maxdamantus: It doesn't stop any context to make way for the new function being called.
13:38  Maxdamantus: Everything's just serial.
13:39  eboyjr: SolarBoom: Outside: numTimes = 5; Inside: if( numTimes ) settimeout();
13:39  eboyjr: make that numTimes-- or --numTimes, whichever is the right way
13:39  Seus: is it possible for javascript to watch for particular events on say a div tag without explicitly putting an event attribute on the div tag?
13:39  Maxdamantus: Postfix
13:39  eboyjr: Seus: addEventListener
13:40  SolarBoom: eboyjr: I'm so confused
13:40  SolarBoom: :-(
13:40 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:41  eboyjr: SolarBoom: You decrement numTimes until it reaches 0, then you don't call the timeout anymore
13:41  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: My terminology is all wrong :p
13:41  Maxdamantus: Actually, it'd probably be prefix
13:42  eboyjr: v8> var ret = 0; var i = 5; while( i-- ) { ret++; } ret;
13:42  v8bot: eboyjr: 5
13:42  SolarBoom: eboyjr: I can't see decrement
13:43  eboyjr: v8> var ret = 0; var i = 5; while( --i ) { ret++; } ret;
13:43  v8bot: eboyjr: 4
13:43  eboyjr: SolarBoom: You can't see it?
13:43  eboyjr: v8> /* SolarBoom */ var i = 7; i++; i;
13:43  v8bot: eboyjr: 8
13:43  eboyjr: Do you see what happened?
13:43  Maxdamantus: js> var i = 5, o = 0; function foo(){ o++; if(--i) foo(); } foo()
13:43  gbot2: Maxdamantus: undefined
13:43  Maxdamantus: js> var i = 5, o = 0; function foo(){ o++; if(--i) foo(); } foo(); o

13:44  SolarBoom: eboyjr: if (numTimes) setTimout
13:44  SolarBoom: ^
13:44  eboyjr: SolarBoom: My mistake
13:44  eboyjr: if (--numTimes) setTimeout
13:44  eboyjr: Maxdamantus: Thanks
13:46  SolarBoom: eboyjr: I have to think of it more detailed
13:46  SolarBoom: eboyjr: Thanks!

13:50  eboyjr: eni23: What do they do exactly?
13:50  SolarBoom: eboyjr: Why we are checking this by if ?
13:52  eboyjr: eni23: fill_start: var i = 0; while( len-- ) { this[i++] = val; }
13:53  eboyjr: SolarBoom: Because we only want to call the timeout when (if) numTimes is greater than 0
13:54  SolarBoom: eboyjr: and inside function we are decrementing it, hm?
13:54  eboyjr: SolarBoom: yes exactly
13:55  eboyjr: eni23: fill_end: var i = this.length; while( len-- ) this[--i] = val; }

14:16  SolarBoom: all the siteTimout() in a function being ran at the same time, right?
14:18  Maxdamantus: No. It's all serial.
14:18  SolarBoom: I use for block, all of them being ran at the same time
14:19  Maxdamantus: What?
14:19  SolarBoom: for(var i = 1; i<5; i++) {setTimeout();}
14:20  Maxdamantus: It's meant to take two arguments.
14:20  SolarBoom: how?
14:21  Maxdamantus: How what?
14:21  SolarBoom: why two arguments?
14:21  eboyjr: You cant use a for block
14:22  SolarBoom: eboyjr: I use ;-)
14:22  Maxdamantus: The function/code and the timeout value.
14:22  eboyjr: SolarBoom: You have to use if
14:22  Maxdamantus: SolarBoom: think of setTimeout() as programming a schedule.
14:22  eboyjr: if only runs it one time, but the setTimeout makes it call itself again, and then run the if again
14:23  Sorella: SolarBoom ≣ JavaScript can only run one instruction at any given time -- it's single threaded.
14:23  eboyjr: after some time of course
14:23  Maxdamantus: One person is performing all the tasks, that one person can't do more than one task at once.
14:23  Sorella: (well, web workers aside)
14:23  Maxdamantus: So setTimeout(1000, foo) just says "do foo() in 1000 ms"
14:23  Maxdamantus: Then setTimeout returns instantly.
14:23  SolarBoom: if we write it 5 times?
14:24  Maxdamantus: It'll return instantly, 5 times.
14:24  SolarBoom: it does them at the same time?
14:24  Maxdamantus: No, it does not do them at the same time.
14:24  Maxdamantus: There's only one context. One person, to perform the tasks.
14:25  SolarBoom: but, I try it, it does all the setTimout(0)s at the same time
14:25  Maxdamantus: It doesn't. You're mistaken.
14:25  SingAlong: hi all
14:25  Maxdamantus: What makes you think it does them "at the same time"?
14:26  Maxdamantus: It does one task after the other.
14:26  SingAlong: I pass an object to a function and it gets enclosed as an object. is this normal?
14:26  SingAlong: oh sorry. confused question
14:26  Sorella: SolarBoom ≣ JavaScript is single threaded. It can only EVER performe one instruction at a time.
14:27  Sorella: SolarBoom ≣ google Asynchronous Programming to understand how it actually works.
14:27  SingAlong: I pass an object to a function and it gets enclosed into an array. is this normal? i do func({'one':1}) and when inside the function i get [{'one':1}] (array with one object)
14:28  Maxdamantus: Normal as in it's not weird?
14:28  SingAlong: Maxdamantus: ya
14:28  Maxdamantus: Or normal as in what most functions happen to do?
14:28  Sorella: SingAlong ≣ it depends on the function. Certainly your object will not be enclosed in an array out of the blue, so I assume the function is doing that at a given place.
14:28  Sorella: protip: read about what the function do, or its source code, and you'll see what's actually going on
14:29  SingAlong: Sorella: let me post it on jsfiddle and show you

14:33  SingAlong: nah that was my problem.
14:33  Maxdamantus: SolarBoom: yes?
14:33  d_mitar: deferred tasks so they are non-blocking. but remove the "" in the set timeout so it does not need to eval it
14:33  d_mitar: :)
14:36  Sorella: SolarBoom ≣ JavaScript also shares the thread used to render the screen. So it can only either update the screen or run javascript at any given time. Thus, it gives you the impression that it moved 5 pixels at once, when in truth it just couldn't render at that time because the engine still had javascript to run.
14:37  tjololo: hi, I have a function that is doing somthing easy as parsing an string to int, but somtimes it its an string starting with 0 and ending with 0. this will cause the parseInt() function to belive that the string is an octal value. do I have to "wash" the string or is there another way?
14:37  d_mitar: Maxdamantus you should look at frameworks that allow you to create chains for animation control
14:37  d_mitar: i know mootools does it
14:38  Maxdamantus: I can imagine how they might work, don't really need to look it up.
14:38  molgrew: tjololo: parseInt can take an additional argument
14:38  Sorella: tjololo ≣ any number starting to 0 in javascript is taken to be an octal notated number (or base 8). Just enforce the base 10 when you parse it, or use a typecast.
14:38  Sorella: `string->int
14:38  gbot2: v8: [parseInt('1', 10), Number('1'), +'1', ~~'1', '1'>>0, '1'|0, 1*'1']

14:39  Sorella: oh, you mean the number
14:39  Sorella: if you want float, you'd use parseFloat...

14:51  poucet: Hello people, I have a rather noob question.  If I put a <script> inside of a <div> how do I refer to the <div>?
14:51  cojack: you can not
14:52  poucet: damn
14:52  poucet: ok
14:52  cojack: why put script inside of <div>
14:52  poucet: cojack: so I don't have to constantrly refer to the div container by name
14:53  poucet: but ok, you answered my question, I've got another way to do this, thanks :)
14:53  cojack: no problem dude
14:53  Sorella: poucet ≣ you still have to get the div by ID or whatever. And yes, you can refer to the div.
14:55  poucet: Sorella: yes, but the current setup looked like
14:55 --- execute is now known as shesek
14:56  SingAlong: how do i check if a variable is an array or an object? (meaning plain [] array or a {} )? using typeof on both says "object"
14:56  poucet: <div id="sometab-container"><div id="graph1"></div> <script>RenderGraphTo('graph1') ...
14:56  Maxdamantus: I don't think you can, unless you delay the referencing of it.
14:56  cojack: SingAlong: instanceof
14:56  poucet: but I can do away with all the stupid 'graph1's by simply refeerring to the container
14:56  cojack: poucet: how do you get reference to this div/
14:56  cojack: ?
14:57  Sorella: poucet ≣ the actual javascript isn't tied to the DOM.
14:57  Maxdamantus: poucet: you should do that after .onload
14:57  poucet: cojack: I'll just refer to 'sometab-container' and have some JS to add the specific graph div's before calling the code that needs the inner dive name
14:57  poucet: and generate graph-names on the fly
14:58  poucet: Maxdamantus: thanks, good tip
14:58  Sorella: poucet ≣ oh, I see. You can just get the container div and grep for the childs that match any arbitrary condition you set. Then render to those childs.
14:59  Sorella: also, you don't really need to wait for onload. You just have to wait until those divs are available on the DOM tree (putting the script right after it will do)
14:59  poucet: Sorella: each graph has it's own paramters, which leads to duplication of the graph-id names

16:13  Maxdamantus: linusc: maybe the readyState doesn't change.
16:13  Reecieboy: igor_111 btw onreadystatechange 1 2 3 is the ones where you display your pic.
16:13  linusc: Reecieboy version?
16:13  Reecieboy: 3.1.12
16:13  Reecieboy: uhh
16:13  Reecieboy: 3.6.12
16:13  linusc: Max: it works in ie and latest firefox
16:14  linusc: ok. i only have the problem when i try with version 3.0.6
16:14  Maxdamantus: Maybe you're doing something else wrong.
16:14  Maxdamantus: Can you show a test case where it fails?
16:14  Reecieboy: ^
16:15  linusc: max: it always fails but only in firefox 3.0.6
16:15  linusc: in 3.6.10 and i ie it always works.
16:16  Maxdamantus: Always fails, some example code?
16:16  Reecieboy: or site.
16:16  linusc: xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function {...
16:17  molgrew: more
16:17  Maxdamantus: Well that's obviously not going to do much.
16:17  Maxdamantus: You're not even defining xmlhttp
16:17  linusc: lol
16:18  Maxdamantus: Also, that fragment of code is invalid syntax, unless used in a string literal or comment.
16:19  linusc: http://pastebin.com/4RFzRanj
16:19  buubot: linusc:  The 58 line paste 4RFzRanj has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/1005  .
16:20  Maxdamantus: The problem is probably not with onreadystatechange
16:20  linusc: pastebin: pastebin.com/4RFzRanj

16:20  Maxdamantus: iirc that version of Firefox would crap out when you use undeclared variables, which you do with xmlhttp
16:20  Sorella: ugh
16:20  linusc: how do i paste url?
16:20  linusc: buubot is on my ass
16:20  buubot: linusc: Couldn't match input.
16:21  linusc: the buubot is on my ass
16:21  Sorella: linusc ≣ you have to be at least consistent with your own coding style...
16:21  linusc: now i dont follow
16:22  Maxdamantus: linusc: try adding: `var xmlhttp;` to the top of your change_main_content function.
16:22  Maxdamantus: Oh wait, you need to declare it in the global scope.
16:23  Maxdamantus: Add `var xmlhttp;` to the top of your script.
16:23  Maxdamantus: Also add `var index;` to the top of change_select
16:24  Maxdamantus: and `var url_argument;` to the top of autoexec
16:25  Sorella: linusc ≣ have you tried moving the onreadystatechange before `xmlhttp.send`?
16:26 * Maxdamantus reckons it'd be extremely odd if that made a difference.
16:26  linusc: sorella: yeah.
16:26  Maxdamantus: I remember getting errors from sites that used undeclared variables, in I think that Firefox version.
16:26  Sorella: linusc ≣ I was referring to how sometimes you put spaces between operators, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you use spaces inside the function parameters, sometimes you don't.
16:27  Sorella: and yeah, sometimes you declare your variables, sometimes you don't.
16:27  Sorella: it just wierds me out .-.
16:27  Maxdamantus: linusc: hang on, what's this? window.onload = new function() { onload();};
16:27  Maxdamantus: new function()
16:27  Maxdamantus: Hm.
16:28  molgrew: mystical incantation
16:28  Sorella: lol
16:28  Maxdamantus: js> new function(){ }
16:28  gbot2: Maxdamantus: {}
16:28  Pilum: new function? Tch.
16:28  Maxdamantus: O_o
16:28  Sorella: it's intantiating an object
16:28  Maxdamantus: js> new function(){ this.foo = "bar"; }
16:28  gbot2: Maxdamantus: {foo:"bar"}
16:28  Maxdamantus: Mmm.. Silly new keyword.
16:28  Maxdamantus: It should force the requirement of the parameter list.
16:28  linusc: none of these changes work.
16:28 * Sorella also hates `new`
16:29  Maxdamantus: Yay \o/
16:29  Sorella: v8> new function(){ return function(){ } }
16:29  v8bot: Sorella: function (){ }
16:29  Maxdamantus: Hm.
16:29  Maxdamantus: v8> new function foo(){ return function bar(){ } }
16:29  v8bot: Maxdamantus: function bar(){ }
16:29  Maxdamantus: Odd.
16:30  Maxdamantus: v8> new (function foo(){ return function bar(){ } })()
16:30  v8bot: Maxdamantus: function bar(){ }
16:30  alosol: Hi there, why an iterator like for(col in columns) being columns an Array with length = 6, will iterate more than 6 times, and starting from the "extra elements" get garbage like "each" ando other code things?
16:30  Sorella: anytime you return a function, it won't get instantiated :3
16:30  Maxdamantus: Why does it do that?
16:30  Sorella: it's awesome
16:30  Maxdamantus: Heh. That does seem very silly.
16:30  Sorella: I dunno why it does that, but it allows you to instantiate things without using the `new` keyword
16:30  molgrew: alosol: you don't have an array
16:31  alosol: in the script console, debugging it says when I over it
16:31  Sorella: alosol ≣ for .. in iterates over the properties of an object. It's not an array iterator
16:31  alosol: Array __proto__: Array
16:31  Sorella: v8> Array.prototype.foo = "bar"; var rv = []; for (var prop in [1,2,3,4]) { rv.push(prop) }; rv
16:31  v8bot: Sorella: ["0", "1", "2", "3", "foo"]
16:32  alosol: so if I want only iterate over the elements
16:32  alosol: ?
16:32  molgrew: then you have an array and someone added methods to the prototype
16:32  Sorella: for iterating over the numeric properties of an array, you have to use for(prefix;condition;step)
16:32  alosol: I see, thx
16:32  alosol: that clears the thing, I guess
16:32  Sorella: `for in
16:33  Sorella: wasn't there a trigger for that?
16:34  Sorella: alosol ≣ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in#Description
16:36  molgrew: there's for/in and js ref for..in according to the jsBot search
16:36  Maxdamantus: js> Array.prototype.foo = "bar"; var rv = []; for (var prop in [1,2,3,4]) { rv.push(prop) }; rv
16:36  gbot2: Maxdamantus: ["0","1","2","3","foo"]
16:37  Sorella: someone seems to have screwed up with the MDC docs.
16:37  pc-world: I have the following JS code for declaring a JSON object: http://pastebin.com/guYBE9Hh - How can I make the condition, so that if it's false, no element is added (and no empty one too)? Is this possible without doing the condition outside the declaration of the variable?
16:37  buubot: pc-world:  The 4 line paste guYBE9Hh has been copied to http://erxz.com/pb/1007  .
16:37  Sorella: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Iterators_and_Generators
16:37  Maxdamantus: js> Array.prototype.foo = "bar"; [x for(x in [1,2,3,4])]
16:37  gbot2: Maxdamantus: ["0","1","2","3","foo"]
16:37  pc-world: lol, fast bot
16:38  Sorella: or maybe it's just me...
16:38  Maxdamantus: Hm, I think it has something like that as an example on MDC
16:38  Maxdamantus: js> Array.prototype.foo = "bar"; [x for each(x in [1,2,3,4])]
16:38  gbot2: Maxdamantus: [1,2,3,4,"bar"]
16:39  cojack: how that it works...
16:39  Sorella: so for each is evil too?
16:39  SethX: yes
16:39  SethX: it doesnt exist on IE
16:40  Maxdamantus: Hm, maybe it doesn't.
16:40  Sorella: pc-world ≣ you have to move it outside the object declaration.
16:41  Maxdamantus: WOAH!?@#
16:41  Maxdamantus: js> var foo, bar; [foo, bar] = [4, 5]; foo + bar;
16:41  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 9
16:41  Maxdamantus: >_<
16:41  molgrew: SethX: not only there
16:42  Sorella: delicious new syntax is delicious :3
16:42  Maxdamantus: js> var foo, bar, baz; [foo, [bar, baz]] = [4, [5, 6]]; foo + bar + baz;
16:42  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 15
16:42  Maxdamantus: Awesome.
16:42  pc-world: thanks - it's difficult to get the indeces outside the object declaration, but I'll try
16:42  Maxdamantus: js> var [foo, [bar, baz]] = [4, [5, 6]]; foo + bar + baz;
16:42  gbot2: Maxdamantus: 15
16:42  Maxdamantus: Crazy :\
16:43  Maxdamantus: Spidermonkey is by far the funnest JS engine.
16:44  Sorella: they're bringing a lot of things from Python to JS
16:45  Maxdamantus: Python is weird.
16:45  Sorella: yield generators, array comprehensions, destructuring assignments and stuff. And the funny internal property names that don't go along well with the rest of the API :D
16:45  Maxdamantus: Some bits imply that the language is highly-imperative.
16:45  Sorella: it is
16:45  Maxdamantus: Then you have those for compound expressions
16:46  linusc: ok. solved it. needed to add a null arg to xmlhttp.send. thank for the help
16:46  Sorella: the thing Python actually lacks to be awesome are real lambdas.
16:46  Maxdamantus: What's unreal about the ones they have now?
16:48  Sorella: they only accept a single expression.
16:48 --- joo|college is now known as joo
16:48  Maxdamantus: Isn't that what a true lambda is?
16:49  temoto: Sorella, that is pretty close to definition of function. Which is what lambda is a syntax for.
16:49  Sorella: Maxdamantus ≣ python lambdas: http://codepad.org/x3E2fTpI
16:50  Sorella: well, yeah, but sometimes you want anonymous functions that can have more than one expression
16:50  Sorella: like when you're connecting events in Gtk+
16:50  Maxdamantus: s = lambda(a): lambda(b): lambda(c): a(b)(c(b))
16:50  Maxdamantus: Maybe that's meant to be k
16:50 * Maxdamantus forgot
16:51  Maxdamantus: er
16:51  Maxdamantus: a(b)(c(b)) was meant to be a(b(c))(c) I think
16:51  Sorella: it just doesn't make sense to define a named function just to connect to an event...
16:51  w3gi: ok i try it in IE and i dont get any error
16:52  w3gi: a click on an button dont have any effect
16:52  Sorella: Dance gavin, dance
16:52  Maxdamantus: s = lambda(a): lambda(b): lambda(c): a(b)(b(c))
16:52  Maxdamantus: There we go.
16:53 --- nV is now known as nVee
16:53  Sorella: what's that?
16:53  Maxdamantus: The S combinator.
16:53  Maxdamantus: Also, k = lambda(a): lambda(_): a
16:54  Maxdamantus: Oh, bleh
16:54  Maxdamantus: s = lambda(a): lambda(b): lambda(c): a(c)(b(c))
16:55  w3gi: http://nopaste.info/bd38f366d1.html ... i call the function so: onclick="elementeEinblenden(10, 'Zusatzleistungen ausklappen ... ');"
16:56  Sorella: >The user was too lazy to give a description （　≖‿≖）
16:57  Sorella: w3gi ≣ what's that trying to accomplish? What do you get instead?
16:57  w3gi: nothing... i click in IE for the button and nothing happend
16:58  w3gi: no error no nothing
16:59 --- joo is now known as joo|sleep
16:59  w3gi: but if someone like you can try it here: http://at.powerdruck-europe.com/index.php?site=bestellung&kat=10160&prod=1560002&prodgr=15601&pap=130REMATT_700_0_350BDG_700_CUV_0_A4PLUS_0_REMATT_0_0_4UMSCHLAG_RDH_HOCH&aufl=1200
17:00  w3gi: sorry i am no win user ... i never use windows
17:01  w3gi: firebug under linux dont tell me any errors and firefox under linux work the same
17:02  w3gi: firefox under windows i mean
17:02  w3gi: Sorella, that help you? i dont know how to explain it different
17:08  qFox: woohoo
17:09  qFox: squashed last bugs of my inline frameset hack :p i think all js1k demo's are working properly again now
17:09  Wes-: yay!
17:09  qFox: it turns out tabs can be significant in js :p but they arent in urls
17:09  qFox: so i had to escape them as well
17:09  Wes-: Bet you wish they hadn't taken div.src away from us! :D
17:09  qFox: div.src wouldnt have saved me
17:10  qFox: its all about adding a nav header without altering the dom of the original demo
17:11  w3gi: ok the buttintext change but nothing get showed...
17:11  w3gi: so it seems as the script dont change the css properties
17:11  qFox: anyways. js1k #2:xmas now officially announced. show me the goodies :D http://js1k.com/2010-xmas/
17:15  w3gi: does someone have any idea?
17:15  qFox: w3gi> my idea is that you really need to do something about url rewriting. ugh.
17:15  qFox: but if you get no error, maybe that's because nothing happens.
17:15  w3gi: the button text get changed
17:16  w3gi: i see now... but it seems as the line elemente[i].style.display = 'table-row'; dont have any effect
17:16  w3gi: or he dont run the loop for (i = 0; i < elemente.length; i++) {
