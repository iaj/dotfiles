09:32 iaj: http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=3   that's what I wanted to post ;)
09:32 oksushi: not helping with a table layout, sorry
09:32 oksushi: only css :)
09:32 iaj: I want there to be a space between the border-top and border-bototm
09:32 oksushi: it's 2011! not 1995!
09:32 iaj: the table layout in the middle is what im forced to by typo 3 :)
09:32 oksushi: use a better cms
09:33 iaj: on the righthand side theres no tables.. its just a css thingie
09:33 oksushi: div.ruler_before_and_after {padding: 1em 0;}
09:33 iaj: DIV.ruler_before_and_after > * { margin: 7px 0; }  that's what I've been trying but instead of > i'd rather want to use the first child and the last..
09:33 iaj: ahhhhh
09:34 iaj: ok, that was dumb
09:34 iaj: thanks so much
09:34 oksushi: np
09:34 oksushi: can i recommend Textpattern
09:35 oksushi: much better than Typo3
09:35 oksushi: I know you can appreciate good software :)
09:36 iaj: Textpattern... i never heard of that one... but Im UNFORTUNATELY forced to set up typo3 here

10:28 iaj: hmmm thanks.. however.. I don't get it.. why is the right side.. the Service Telefon using padding: 0 9px;  it only should go for the .block-inner classes... and that one doesn't have one...
10:28 iaj: its confusing me=)
10:32 iaj: shouldnt div.block-inner.box only select all divs with block-inner AND .box class set?
10:33 oksushi: yes
10:33 iaj: ohh i think I get it...
10:34 iaj: div.block-inner h1, p, a { padding: 0 9px; }
10:34 iaj: that one is selecting all p and a tags.. correct?
10:34 oksushi: yes
10:34 iaj: do I have to write all the div. stuff down again?
10:34 oksushi: yes. #css has links for you to read
