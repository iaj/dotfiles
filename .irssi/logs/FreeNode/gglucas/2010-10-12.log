12:24 GGLucas: Hello.
12:26 iaj: Hi there - I hope I'm not disturbing
12:26 iaj: But since I saw you as a vimp/vi guy on my git repos...
12:27 iaj: I'd like you to ask what adblock/flashblock plugins you are using in vimperator
12:27 GGLucas: Just adblock+. I wasn't aware that vimperator needed special ones?
12:27 iaj: Hmm alright, so abdblock + is sufficient?
12:27 GGLucas: I don't usually visit sites that use flash, so I don't really need flashblock.
12:28 GGLucas: For me, yeah.
12:28 iaj: Which List did you subscribe to?
12:28 GGLucas: EasyList
12:29 GGLucas: I've never really needed to look at that extensively, I usually just install adblock, choose the top list and all the ads disappear.
12:29 GGLucas: Highly convenient.

12:47 iaj: Ehhw.. Thanks a lot! I'll take a look at that.... Which other plugins beside that are you using in Firefox, can you tell me ?!
12:47 GGLucas: I use Firebug for web development, greasemonkey to run a couple of userscripts and It's All Text to edit textareas in vim.
12:48 GGLucas: Other than that most of my stuff comes from vimperator plugins.

14:47 GGLucas: Most of mine are site-specific, they give extra keybindings and make it generally easier to use with the keyboard only.
14:49 iaj: Got some examples?
14:49 GGLucas: Sure.
14:50 GGLucas: Stuff like http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/60578 and http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/50856
14:53 iaj: Oh ok... :-) that's nice... is some stuff like that exisiting for goolesearches or youtube as well
