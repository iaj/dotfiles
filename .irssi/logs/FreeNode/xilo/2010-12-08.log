16:53 --- Query: Starting query with xilo on FreeNode
16:53 iaj: hey
16:53 iaj: may I bug you for a second?
16:53 xilo: sure
16:54 iaj: that plugin you just mentioned... what exactly is it doing, im reading its page on vim.org... but can you gimme an example?
16:54 xilo: supertab?
16:54 xilo: or neocomplcache
16:54 iaj: ohhh... you use SUPERTAB and... neocomplcache?
16:55 xilo: yes
16:55 iaj: can you paste me your .vimrc settings for those plugins? im going to check the combination out:)
16:56 xilo: http://pastie.org/1359201
16:56 xilo: there's my .vimrc
16:57 iaj: thanks
16:57 iaj: one sec :)
17:00 iaj: mhh im just sourcing it at the bottom of my .vimrc
17:01 iaj: hmmm did I miss something.. <tab> is inserting tabs now?
17:01 xilo: yeah
17:01 xilo: er
17:01 xilo: <tab> is tab key
17:01 xilo: i guess depending on where it's used in mappings it will
17:02 iaj: Ahw... ok... can  you gimme a good example
17:02 iaj: I see now its showing up stuff from time to time
17:02 xilo: like open your .vimrc file in it
17:02 xilo: can type
17:02 xilo: set <tab key>
17:04 iaj: set<space> tabkey?
17:04 iaj: that's inserting a tab key for me :)_
17:05 xilo: uh
17:05 xilo: try typing the first 3 letters of a parameter you can set
17:05 xilo: then tab
17:09 iaj: hmmm ok i see...  that's nice
17:09 xilo: aye

17:31 iaj: Hmmmm so it always pops up stuff when one inserted 3 characters
17:31 xilo: correct
17:31 xilo: you can change it
17:31 xilo: to however many characters
17:32 iaj: hmmm... yeah... Im mainly simply trying to find a way to be able to use completion BUT not completing if theres more that 1 match... just competing to the longest common string and then being able to simply keep on typing and reduce the completion choices
17:33 xilo: that's what it does
17:33 iaj: yeah but it does that
17:33 iaj: automatically
17:33 iaj: I don't want to have choices shown up automatically
17:33 xilo: you would need to change the keybindings
17:33 xilo: and stuff
17:34 iaj: like what do you mean?
17:36 xilo: you can turn on neocomplcache_disable_auto_complete
17:38 iaj: oohh.. nice :)
17:39 iaj: so you are happy with it?
17:39 xilo: mostly
17:39 xilo: there's 2 things that piss me off:
17:40 xilo: 1) i need to figure out how to not search #include files from /usr/local because it makes C/C++ completion SLOW
17:40 xilo: 2) suptertab+neocomplcache+snipmate don't work well together
17:40 iaj: ohhh yeh... a snippet system is using tab as well i guess :\
17:41 xilo: other than those 2 issues i like it
17:42 iaj: hmm seems to mess around with fuzzy
17:42 iaj: :\
17:42 xilo: what's fuzzy do
17:46 iaj: ahhh well uqickly open files
17:46 iaj: mostly
17:49 xilo: ah
17:53 iaj: hmmm yeah
17:53 iaj: the completition in programming stuff is slow I guess
17:54 xilo: for c/c++ it is
17:54 xilo: what were you trying it in
17:54 iaj: java /eclim
17:55 xilo: oh
17:55 xilo: haven't tried java

18:02 iaj: heh :-)
18:05 xilo: think i might just turn off supertab instead
18:09 iaj: mh yeh... well I think I may get used to C-n C-p and C-space for omni compl
18:09 iaj: like in eclipse
18:09 xilo: lol
18:10 iaj: autocmd Filetype java noremap <buffer> <C-]> :JavaSearchContext<cr>
18:10 iaj: the first good choice :D
18:16 xilo: is autocomplpop faster?
18:16 iaj: i didn't try that one
18:16 iaj: because it would annoy me to see it all the time
18:19 xilo: lol
18:20 iaj: :\

18:47 iaj: mhh really curious - so you aren't using eclim atm?
18:47 xilo: no
18:47 xilo: vim 7.3 didn't like it

19:09 iaj: heh
19:09 iaj: yeh im using 7.3 actually :)
19:09 iaj: oohhwell hm
19:10 iaj: i got a question: is there some way to just show the completion list which then gets smaller as you type?  (not selecting the first match automatically)
19:11 xilo: you'd need to open the popup window
19:11 xilo: how i have it setup it automatically does it
19:11 xilo: but i just have auto popup
19:11 iaj: so you suggest me to use neocompl?
19:12 xilo: if you want lol
19:13 iaj: imap <expr><TAB> neocomplcache#sources#snippets_complete#expandable() ? "\<Plug>(neocomplcache_snippets_expand)" : pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<TAB>" 
19:14 iaj: isn't that actually overwriting supertabs stuff?
19:14 iaj: inoremap <expr><TAB>  pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<TAB>" 
19:14 iaj: and that one as well :D
19:15 xilo: no clue lol
19:15 xilo: i removed those
19:15 xilo: recently
