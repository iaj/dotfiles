16:15 iaj: Hmmm lo there :)
16:15 grawity: Hi. 	  				 	 	 	   	 	  	   		  	 
16:15 iaj: Thanks for adapting the growl script
16:15 iaj: its working so far.. just for the case where I've got notifcations turned off
16:15 iaj: I get that annoying message
16:16 iaj:           2010-12-20 16:16:06.256 growlnotify[33734:903] could not find local GrowlApplicationBridgePathway, falling back to NSDNC
16:19 grawity: Does growlnotify have some sort of "quiet" mode that would cause it to fail silently?
16:22 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307410
16:23 iaj: doesn't look like it
16:23 iaj: :(
16:23 grawity: Hmm
16:24 grawity: You could make a wrapper script - also named 'growlnotify' - that would run the real program with the "2>/dev/null" spell
16:24 grawity: tbh, I'm not sure whether it's better for the notifier script to fail quietly or not.

16:43 iaj: hmmm yeah
16:44 iaj: no clue either
16:44 iaj: but yeah.. that one sounds like a solution to me :)
16:44 iaj: or call the call growlnotify_noerror and call that from your notify_send.pl
