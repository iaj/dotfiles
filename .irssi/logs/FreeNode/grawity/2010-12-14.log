13:31 --- Query: Starting query with grawity on FreeNode
13:31 iaj: heya ;)
13:31 iaj: 13:31:40  Not enough arguments for Irssi::Script::notify_send::send_growl at /Users/iaj/.irssi/scripts/notify_send.pl line 232, near "$rawmsg)"
13:32 grawity: I just fixed that; git pull
13:32 grawity: Also, /set notify_targets growl
13:33 iaj: ok.. at least it loaded :)
13:33 iaj: how could I check?
13:34 grawity: Receive a message.
13:34 iaj: 13:34:07  Could not notify growl: Growl support requires Mac::Growl
13:34 iaj: mhh I thought I installed that
13:34 grawity: try `perl -MMac::Growl -e1`
13:35 grawity: Or /script exec use Mac::Growl;
13:35 grawity: If it complains, you didn't install it completely...
13:35 grawity: If it works fine, I messed somethign up.
13:35 iaj: Warning: Cannot install Growl::Mac, don't know what it is.
13:35 iaj: and the other command you gave me is throwing up errors
13:35 iaj: gna
13:35 grawity: It's Mac::Growl, not Growl::Mac.
13:36 iaj: yeah I invoked  cpan Mac::Growl
13:36 iaj: but that message came up.. with install Growl::Mac
13:37 grawity: Just run 'cpan'
13:37 grawity: And run "install Mac::Growl" from inside.
13:39 iaj: http://pastebin.com/3ZRUJNh0
13:41 grawity: hm, didn't it ask you to install Mac::Glue or something?
13:42 iaj: Nope :(
13:42 iaj: I tried to install that manually
13:42 iaj: but failed
13:43 iaj: I don't like the :: pl packages
13:44 grawity: Hmm
13:44 grawity: 'install Mac::Glue'?
13:45 iaj: tried that
13:47 grawity: ...Does OS X come with a "growlnotify" program?
13:48 iaj: http://pastebin.com/HPN0RW7X
13:48 iaj: yeah.. its called growlnotify
13:52 grawity: I made the script run growlnotify if Mac::Growl is not available.
13:52 grawity: Might work.
