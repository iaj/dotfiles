12:38 --- Query: Starting query with MetaCosm on FreeNode
12:38 iaj: hey there... you got a second?  I got a little question - but non-vim related.
12:38 iaj: :-D
12:38 MetaCosm: shoot.
12:38 iaj: i see most of you guys use remote hosting for your irc sessions - and I'm currentyl trying to find a good one
12:39 iaj: do you have any recommendations?
12:39 iaj: + i luv fuzzy as well... I just found out I need to disable mrucmd mode to have 'foldopen' = search to be working.
12:42 MetaCosm: Well, if you are willing to spend a couple bucks a month, I gotta say a brand new product called IRCCloud is slick as hell
12:42 MetaCosm: outside of that, any unix shell and a bouncer will work
12:43 iaj: Mhh,, yeah I know... huh.. IrcCloud? that's not https://irccloud.com/ that one is iT?
12:43 iaj: s/iT/it.
12:43 MetaCosm: it is
12:44 MetaCosm: I was in the beta
12:44 MetaCosm: really insanely slick, keeps you always connected
12:45 MetaCosm: ohh, still beta
12:45 iaj: Mhhh, but this one is browser based?
12:45 iaj: Yeh.
12:45 MetaCosm: yeah, it is browser based
12:46 iaj: wa.. this is absolutely not what I'm looking for :)
12:46 iaj: I want to keep on using my irssi :)
12:46 MetaCosm: then any bouncer will work
12:46 iaj: so you don't have recommendations? mhh ok
12:47 MetaCosm: too many to really make a recommendation
12:47 iaj: mb name some good ones :)
12:47 iaj: where are you at?
12:47 MetaCosm: What does that have to do with anything? 
12:47 MetaCosm: BNC is the orig.
12:48 iaj: Nothing - sorry for asking...
12:48 iaj: :-)
12:48 iaj: Thanks!
12:48 iaj: It would be wise to chose a server in my country - because of the lower ping, right?
12:49 MetaCosm: well, doesn't matter that much. 
12:49 MetaCosm: IRC isn't latency dependant
