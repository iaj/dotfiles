17:21  peth: vim_mode internally thinks that \x7F is BS. while most terms do have the backspace key mapped to send 7F, some (eg. mine :)) send true BS (\x08) instead of DEL (\x7F). it would be nice if vim_mode handled both.
17:22  peth: this surfaces in ex mode and cmd mode. ins mode handles this fine, i suppose because that's normal irssi line editing.
