20:13 @shabble: peth: cheers, I'll look into it when I have time
20:14 @shabble: should / can a window be active if you're not connected to a server?
20:17  peth: shabble: i encountered that when my isp did the daily chicanery disconnect
20:19  peth: so i had a few windows open, some of which still had activity in it. because reconnecting took longer than usual, i decided to read up...
20:20 @shabble: ah, ok.
20:20  peth: the :snext thing does happen on a new, still unconnected, irssi. i guess it's just cosmetics as no one in their right mind would switch servers when he isn't connected to any
20:21 @shabble: yeah, but we should probably just have a check that does nothing silently, rather than warning
20:22  peth: wouldn't be a alarming when it does happen, i agree :)
20:22  peth: *be as
20:26  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 62b5a3f (1 files in 1 dirs): vim_mode: fix :snext/prev generating warnings when not connected - http://bit.ly/daPlGG
20:30  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 43addba (1 files in 1 dirs): vim_mode: mapped Irssi commands only use $server context if it is available. ... - http://bit.ly/9XQP0p
20:30 @shabble: peth: right, that should be those things fixed, I hope.
20:30  peth: quick as ever :)
20:30  peth: i'll give it whirl
20:30 @shabble: only very brief testing, so let me know if they still happen/anything else explodes :)
20:31  peth: will do. thanks!
