21:39  rudi_s: shabble: Great work ;-) I haven't tested it yet but the git commits look good.
21:54  shabble: rudi_s: np. give it a try, it's been tested a bit already ;)
21:54  rudi_s: That's great ;-)
21:58  rudi_s: shabble: Wow, that really looks great.
21:59  rudi_s: But I get a little draw problem: "[ [Page: 1/3 0%]" when I scroll up from "[Page: 3/3 100%]"
22:00  rudi_s: And I don't get a 2/3 in this case.
22:01  rudi_s: I have "[Page: 3/3 100%]", then I press alt-p, then I get "[ [Page: 1/3 0%]", then alt-p again and I get "[ [Page: 1/3 0%]" again.
22:01  rudi_s: And an option to customize the output (maybe printf-like) would be great ;-)
22:03  shabble: rudi_s: yeah, hyou can edit it for now ;)
