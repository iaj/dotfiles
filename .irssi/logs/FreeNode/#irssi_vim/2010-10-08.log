02:28  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: dev commits b2bec66...8f84f6e - http://bit.ly/cmHEL1
02:28 @rudi_s: shabble: Just added :map, if you have time, please test it (everybody else is invited too of course).
02:29 @rudi_s: The maps are not persistent, that's the next step.
02:29 @shabble: ok, I'll have a look
02:29 @rudi_s: Thanks.
02:30 @shabble: also I seem to have some weird conflicts on the dev branch, despite not editing it :/
02:31 @rudi_s: :-/
02:31  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: dev Simon Ruderich * 95cd31d (1 files in 1 dirs): vim_mode: Fix :map on a placeholder mapping. ... - http://bit.ly/b4DX9t
02:32 @rudi_s: I've did some renaming, maybe that's causing it.
02:32 @shabble: seems to be the prompt_replace, which it didn't think was added
02:32 @shabble: and now claims it's added twice during a merge
02:34 @rudi_s: Hm, that's really weird.

14:45 @rudi_s: I added :map and support for a vim_moderc file yesterday. If anybody has time, testing it would be great. Thanks.
14:46 @rudi_s: (Documentation is at the beginning of vim_mode.pl as usual.)
16:23  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: dev Simon Ruderich * c717146 (1 files in 1 dirs): vim_mode: $map->{char} is always in <> notation. ...
16:23  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: dev Simon Ruderich * 0997134 (1 files in 1 dirs): vim_mode: Add debug print when calling an ex-command.

16:26  estragib: rudi_s: mapping works great for me so far. am i correct in assuming one can only map existing commands?
16:27 @rudi_s: estragib: Great. Yes, when scripting support is added, you can also map custom functions.
16:27 @rudi_s: Is this limitation a problem?
16:28  estragib: no problem really. just thinking about semi-macros like map gX iINSERT TEXT<ESC>
16:28  estragib: not sure if i'd even use that
16:29 @rudi_s: estragib: Hm, yeah, sounds a little difficult to do properly, but I'll add it to the todo list.
16:30  estragib: i'm really not sure as to its usefulness, it just presented itself when i was in testing mode :p
16:31 @rudi_s: ;-) Yeah. It would be nice to have, I'll think about it.
16:31 @rudi_s: Thanks for testing.
16:31  estragib: ok, harvest: 1) hitting control chars (incl. tab) in ex mode puts them in the ex prompt or does weird stuff, for example with <C-D> [should filter or, wishlist fantasy, offer completion and editing]
16:31  estragib: 2) 2) deleting backward d0 has the same behavior as y0 did, ie. it does delete the cursor char when it shouldn't
16:32  estragib: 3) <C-E> and <C-Y> should do what <C-U> and <C-D> do atm, ie. scroll by line. <C-U> and <C-D> scroll half a screen by default in vim.
16:32  estragib: 4) backspacing over the : in ex mode should exit ex mode
16:32  estragib: that's it for today :)
16:33 @rudi_s: estragib: Wow, quite a list. Thanks for reporting.
16:38  estragib: well, it's not for totally altruistic motives ;) i really love this thing.
16:39 @rudi_s: ;-) Hehe. I'm glad to hear that.
16:45  estragib: wishlist: it would be nice if :ls somehow indicated current and alternate buffer
16:46  estragib: (maybe activity too?)
16:46 @rudi_s: estragib: Good idea.
16:46 @rudi_s: Hm, I'm not sure how do check for activity.
16:46 @rudi_s: shabble: Any idea? ^
16:47 @rudi_s: estragib: But the problem is, at the moment :ls just calls /window list, to change that we'll have to get the data manually, adding it to the todo list.
16:48  estragib: i'm just mentioning these as i notice them. i'm very aware you have to draw the bloatline somewhere :)
16:49 @rudi_s: Yeah, but I like your suggestions and will add them sooner or later. We are only at 2.5K lines, there ist still room for more ;-)
16:50  estragib: yay :)
16:53  estragib: you may have already answered this above (i'm not sure what you meant by custom functions): what would be the way to map irssi /functions in vim_mode? like if i wanted to map <C-L> to /clear?
16:54 @rudi_s: estragib: With custom functions I meant functions added by a vim_mode script (which doesn't work yet, but will be added soon), so you can extend vim_mode through custom functions (like switch to words or whatever).
16:54 @rudi_s: estragib: Not possible yet, but I'll add it too, thanks for suggesting.
16:57  estragib: another wishlist: a :so counterpart would be nice. i'm mapping happily along and would like to be able to write my changes to the vim_moderc as /save does for irssi.
16:59 @rudi_s: estragib: Hm, I'm not sure if we should add that, it's not in Vim (and we might add more stuff to vim_moderc in the future and then rewriting mappings will be difficult).
16:59 @rudi_s: :map lists all custom maps
17:00  estragib: :mkvimrc, but i agree it's probably not worth it
17:00 @rudi_s: estragib: Nice, didn't know about that command.
17:00  estragib: copy and pasting :map output should work fine, though
17:01 @rudi_s: But I'm not sure if it's necessary. If you really like it, I'll add it though.
17:01  estragib: no, really. please do what you think is best.
17:01 @rudi_s: Ok, I'll add it to my todo list, should be easy to add and it might be useful.
17:08  estragib: oh, i can't map \<something> either
17:09 @rudi_s: estragib: Hm, just noticed that, no idea why at the moment.
17:10  estragib: hehe, definitely something to do with escaping. \\ prints \
17:10 @rudi_s: Yeah, looks like it.
