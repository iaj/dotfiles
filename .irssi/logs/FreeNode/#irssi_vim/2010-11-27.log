16:58  anon33_: hello - i've typed /load vim_mode.pl (it's located in ~/.irssi/scripts) and it says that it's been loaded, yet irssi continues to function as "normal"
16:58  anon33_: i was wondering what might have gone wrong in this?
17:00  peth: anon33_: you've typed "/script load vim_mode.pl" or "/load vim_mode.pl"?
17:00  anon33_: script load
17:01  peth: you used to have to add the sb items yourself, don't know if that's still the case
17:01  rudi_s: anon33_: Check the installation instructions at the top of vim_mode.pl
17:01  peth: does pressing <ESC> do anything?
17:01  rudi_s: But even if you've setup nothing, pressing esc should get you into normal mode.
17:02  anon33_: pressing <esc> does get me into normal mode :)
17:02  rudi_s: Type something. Press <esc> and try to move with h l.
17:02  anon33_: sorry for not RTFM :(
17:02  rudi_s: ;-) no problem
17:02  rudi_s: Please tell us if/how we can improve the documentation.
17:02  anon33_: so to change between windows, it's B[n]? i'm getting adjusted to <C-N>/<C-P>
17:03  anon33_: what would be ~fantastic~ would be a indicator on the (statusline? - that thing at the bottom) about which mode I'm in
17:04  rudi_s: anon33_: Check the documentation ;-)
17:04  rudi_s: There's a statusbar item which you can use.
17:05  anon33_: rudi_s: I suck
17:05  rudi_s: anon33_: You can change windows with :b number/partial-name/etc. (the doc at the beginning should mentation that).
17:05  rudi_s: documentation = beginning of vim_mode.pl
17:06  rudi_s: In insert mode your bindings should continue to work as usual. In command mode you can rebind them.
17:06  rudi_s: :map <C-P> :bprev
17:06  rudi_s: :map <C->N :bnext
17:06  rudi_s: Should work for command mode.
17:07  rudi_s: To make that permanent add those two lines to ~/.irssi/vim_moderc (create it).
17:07  rudi_s: If you find any bugs, please let us know.
17:07  anon33_: of course
17:07  anon33_: i found out about this through the reddit posting
17:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi_vim +o rudi_s]
17:08  anon33_: I use awesome and pentadactyl, irssi was one of the big holes missing vim bindings
17:08 --- rudi_s has changed the topic to: Irssi Vim Mode 1.0 Released! https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/vim_mode_1.0/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl | Documentation at the beginning of vim_mode.pl and at http://www.guckes.net/irssi/vim_mode.additions.txt (a little outdated, but also a good vim introduction).
17:09 @rudi_s: anon33_: Yeah, that's what we thought as well. ;-)
17:09 --- rudi_s sets modes [#irssi_vim -o rudi_s]
17:10  rudi_s: And after a few days of hacking we got vim_mode.pl :-) (the features you see now took a little longer ..)
17:10  anon33_: that script is looooooooooooong
17:12  rudi_s: ... yeah, ~3k lines and there are still some features missing (real :imap support for example). But at the moment we don't have much time for irssi_vim.pl :-/
17:13  anon33_: bummer! i was curious about support only for normal mode, but it's better than nothing
17:14  anon33_: so anything custom (including /statusbar window add vim_mode) would go into vim_moderc?
17:14  rudi_s: anon33_: ? What do you mean?
17:15  rudi_s: (with "bummer! i was curious about ..")
17:15  anon33_: how keybindings (and mappings) only exist for normal mode, yet everything previously configured in irssi exists in insert mode - ie, it's not a complete refactoring of irssi
17:15  rudi_s: anon33_: No. Only vim_mode.pl commands. /statusbar window add vim_mode is a normal irssi command. So you just type in irssi and run /save to save your changes.
17:16  rudi_s: anon33_: Yeah, that's still a problem. It was the simplest solution and as most vim commands are in normal mode only it should work fine most of the time.
17:16  anon33_: rudi_s: it works great :D
17:17  rudi_s: If you like to use jj to exit insert mode that works, and Ctrl-R in insert mode as well (to insert a register).
17:17  rudi_s: :-)
17:17  anon33_: i should get used to jj, but i've been using <C-[> for months
17:17  rudi_s: Better :imap support with vim-like timeout settings is planned, but before that we'll have to do some refactoring.
17:18  anon33_: sidenote - where in my .irssi/config would i add "/statusbar window add vim_mode / add vim_windows"?
17:18  rudi_s: anon33_: It's not enabled by default, check the documentation how to enable it if you want to give it a try. I'm using it since a few years and it works great for me. <C-[> with Capslock as Ctrl works fine too though.
17:18  rudi_s: anon33_: Not in your .irssi/config. Just in irssi.
17:19  anon33_: so there's no way to autoload that?
17:19  rudi_s: /statusbar window add ..
17:19  rudi_s: anon33_: Autoload? Once you run it once and use /save it'll stay.
17:20  anon33_: oh, alright.
17:20  anon33_: i've been using irssi for about 2 months now
17:21  rudi_s: irssi is great ;-)
