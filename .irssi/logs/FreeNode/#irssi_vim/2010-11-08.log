00:07  estragib: pasting a line in cmd mode leaves the cursor in an invalid position after the line. hitting space then moves the cursor one pos to the left.
00:47  rudi_s: estragib: Thanks, added to TODO list (I hope I'll have some time to fix it soon).

20:44  tmr: Known issue with uberprompt? "Use of uninitialized value $pos in string ne at /home/users/jake/.irssi/scripts/uberprompt.pl line 273.", "Use of uninitialized value $prompt_data_pos in string eq at /home/users/jake/.irssi/scripts/uberprompt.pl line 313." and same on line 337...
20:44  rudi_s: shabble: ^
20:44  shabble: I'll check it out
20:44  rudi_s: tmr: shabble is the uberprompt expert, I hope he knows more.
20:45  shabble: tmr: whilst using it with vim_mode?
20:45  shabble: any particular triggering conditions?
20:45  tmr: shabble, yeah. When trying to use ex mode.
20:46  tmr: Going in to ex mode and trying to write anything will trigger those errors.
20:46  shabble: ok, i can see how it might happen, I'll add some additional checks
20:46  shabble: are you running the latest version?
20:47  shabble: I really need some way to make the version number auto-update with git
20:47  tmr: Just curlet out master version.
20:47  rudi_s: shabble: IMHO not a good idea. That's what a RVS like Git is for.

20:48  rudi_s: estragib: That was easy to fix (I hope), please check the dev branch.
20:48  rudi_s: And I only pushed one commit ..
20:49  estragib: right, that did it
20:49  rudi_s: estragib: Perfect, thanks for the report.
20:49  tmr: shabble, don't know if it's relevant but I used prompt_info before and just tried out uberprompt for the first time.
20:51  shabble: tmr: ah, yes. That is probably the reason
20:51  shabble: when you register a signal with irssi, you cannot change the arguments to it thereafter
20:51  shabble: and the API (signal arguments) for uberprompt changed a little bit
20:51  shabble: sadly, the only way to fix is to restart :/
20:51  tmr: Oh noes.. Do you mean.. NOOOO!
20:52  rudi_s: tmr: I know the feeling killed my irssi uptime as well ;-)
20:52  tmr: Damn, I really really need to setup bouncer between irssi and ssl servers.
20:54  shabble: I'll have anotehr search for a signal_unregister or other trickery
20:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: tab-complete Tom Feist * e810321 (0 files in 0 dirs): test_harness: added a stubbed C irssi module for eventual signal capture/injection
20:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: tab-complete Tom Feist * 997c0d1 (1 files in 1 dirs): test_harness: cleaned up makefile, added note to de-OSXify it later
20:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: tab-complete Tom Feist * 622ac22 (1 files in 1 dirs): fix for prompt_ifno users upgrading to uberprompt without restart (hopefully)
20:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: tab-complete commits 0000000...622ac22 - http://bit.ly/blUmhi
20:58  estragib: does the last bit.ly url resolve funny for anyone else?
20:59  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * cd581c0 (1 files in 1 dirs): fix for prompt_ifno users upgrading to uberprompt without restart (hopefully) - http://bit.ly/9FI8lo
20:59  rudi_s: I get "That page doesn't exist!", not sure if that's an elinks problem though.
21:00  shabble: tmr: you could try that version of uberprompt
21:00  rudi_s: shabble: Please merge dev.
21:00  shabble: sorry about the spam, I keep getting my git branches confused :)
21:00  shabble: rudi_s: sure
21:00  rudi_s: shabble: Thanks.
21:00  tmr: shabble, dev?
21:01  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * bc218fc (1 files in 1 dirs): Merge remote branch 'origin/dev' - http://bit.ly/bgFrEf
21:01  shabble: tmr: should be in master
21:01  shabble: check line ~271 for "    $pos = 'UP_INNER' unless defined $pos;
21:02  tmr: Oh lookie, no more errors :)
21:07  tmr: Ehm.. Do the urls in /topic need updating or is github just acting up again?
21:07  shabble: seems to work for me
21:07  shabble: which ones?
21:08  tmr: http://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/dev/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl
21:08  tmr: Gives me 301.
21:08  shabble: seems fine
21:08  shabble: oh, wait
21:09  shabble: github went all https recently
21:09  shabble: ls
21:09  shabble: oops
21:09  tmr: Ah yeah, https works.
21:09  rudi_s: I'll fix the topic.
21:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi_vim +o shabble]
21:10 --- shabble sets modes [#irssi_vim +o rudi_s]
21:10 --- rudi_s has changed the topic to: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/master/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl | http://www.guckes.net/irssi/vim_mode.additions.txt | Dev version, please test: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/dev/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl
21:10 @shabble: I was going to :s/// it, and then realised I don't have it working on this irssi :(
21:10 @rudi_s: :-/ .. Ah, didn't think of that .. still too used to "normal" irssi.
21:11 @rudi_s: shabble: Time to fix that, load vim_mode ;-)
21:11 @shabble: hehe
21:11 @shabble: yep, will do
21:11 @rudi_s: :-)
21:11 --- rudi_s sets modes [#irssi_vim -o rudi_s]
21:11 @shabble: I might make a little fix to disable esc, since I use it for all sorts of normal stuff
21:11 @shabble: so only c-c and jj work for switching modes
21:12  rudi_s: Hm. As option?
21:12 @shabble: I'm pondering that
21:12 @shabble: I thin it might be worthwhile
21:12 @shabble: since it can be pretty invasive, with the timeout
21:12  rudi_s: Yeah, that's true.
21:17  tmr: shabble, uberprompt working fine without restart after I figured out how to configure it, thanks!
21:17 @shabble: excellent
