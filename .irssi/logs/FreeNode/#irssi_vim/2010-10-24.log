14:39  shabble: rudi_s: welcome back!
14:39  shabble: i've been a bit busy too
14:39  rudi_s: :-)
14:39  shabble: maybe we need to trim the todo list a bit, and realease a proper first version before we bioth get bogged down with other work
14:39  rudi_s: I know the feeling ;-)
14:40  rudi_s: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
14:41  rudi_s: I think the current dev is quite stable and well documented. After some more testing and if no big bugs are found, we could release it.
14:41  rudi_s: (And ignore the TODO for now, then later add them.)
14:46  shabble: sounds good
14:46  shabble: I"ll install it on my main irssi and start giving it a bit of a workout
14:46  shabble: shall we aim to release next friday/sat
