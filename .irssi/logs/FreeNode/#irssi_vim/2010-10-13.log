13:30 @shabble: iaj: hi, I found a few bugs in teh uberprompt/hist search, if you want to try again
13:31  iaj: shabble: ahh.. cool
13:31  iaj: thanks, I will give it a shot
13:31 @shabble: (bear in mind that I have no idea if it'll work side by side with vim mode, probably not)
13:31  iaj: hmm, you aren't using vim mode?
13:32  iaj: 13:31:58  Use of uninitialized value in string eq at /Users/iaj/.irssi/scripts/uberprompt.pl line 289.
13:33  iaj: http://pastebin.com/82RLxGM5
13:33  iaj: comes from rl_history_search
13:35 @shabble: fixed
13:35  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 8edb0c6 (1 files in 1 dirs): fixed undef bug in uberprompt - http://bit.ly/bA4cvw
13:35 @shabble: you'll need both new uberprompt & new rl_history_search
13:36  iaj: hmm Im using both of m... the ones from master branch
13:37  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 3eb58a8 (1 files in 1 dirs): removed a defined-or which needs perl 5.10 - http://bit.ly/cRIOqL
13:37  iaj: Hmm.. still got the problem when I /script load uberprompt
13:37 @shabble: I guess you're using perl 5.8 or so?
13:38  iaj: 5.8.9
13:38  iaj: why, do I need something more recent?
13:38 @shabble: nah, I just fixed the thing that needed it
13:38 @shabble: should be ok now
13:38  iaj: 13:38:46  Use of uninitialized value in string eq at /Users/iaj/.irssi/scripts/uberprompt.pl line 289.i
13:39  iaj: and line 266 same story
13:40 @shabble: the only way I can see that happening is if you're using an older version of rl_history
13:41 @shabble: can you find hte code (for rl_hist) and search for a line that contains 'signal_emit'?
13:41 @shabble: should be around line 136
13:48  iaj: I can't even load rl_history_search
13:48 @shabble: why not?
13:48  iaj: oh
13:48  iaj: maybe now
13:49  iaj: Oh both loaded..
13:49  iaj: same problem...
13:49  iaj: sec I'll do the search
13:49  iaj: wth... trying to open it and my vim crashes :\
13:49 @shabble: ?!
13:51  iaj: line 129 it is
13:51  iaj: the signal_emit
13:51  iaj: and 134
13:51  iaj: ls
13:51  iaj: ops.
13:52  iaj: the use of uninitialized value appears as soon as I load uberprompt and go to : mode
13:52 @shabble: oh, right
13:52 @shabble: vim_mode isn't using uberprompt yet
13:52 @shabble: that'll be why
13:53  iaj: ohhh.. ok..  I thought it was specifially for vim_mode
13:53 @shabble: well, it sort of is
13:53 @shabble: but I haven't updated vim_mode to use it yet :)
13:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * fb9f56c (1 files in 1 dirs): Merge remote branch 'origin/dev'
13:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * ee9ce3d (1 files in 1 dirs): switched vim_mode to using uberprompt
13:56  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master commits 3eb58a8...ee9ce3d - http://bit.ly/b2xeCb
13:56 @shabble: have now
14:00  iaj: sweet.
14:00  iaj: lemme try
14:00  iaj: (tbh I don't really know what uberprompt is doing SO FAR)
14:02  iaj: still the same problem
14:06  iaj: :-(
14:12  iaj: what exactly is uberprompt for? just for rl_history_search, shabble ?
14:17 @shabble: iaj: it's a general purpose utility script for doing stuff with your prompt that you wouldn't normally be able to do
14:17 @shabble: so far history_search, scrolled_reminder and vim_mode use it
14:18  iaj: shabble: Ahh.. alright... I still get that odd message line 289, 266 uninitizialed value of string eq
14:18 @shabble: ok
14:18 @shabble: when looking at those signal_emit lines, is there an argument like 'UP_INNER' there?
14:18 @shabble: that's about teh only thing I can think that would cause those things ot be undef
14:18  iaj: where should I look... rl_history_search?
14:18 @shabble: yeah
14:19  iaj: even if I don't load up rl_history_search
14:19  iaj: I get those errors by uberprompt.pl
14:19 @shabble: you running vim_mode?
14:19  iaj: k
14:19  iaj: yeah
14:19 @shabble: oh, crap
14:19 @shabble: I think I know why
14:19  iaj: Oh.. sec.. Im not getting them ATM
14:19 @shabble: do/did you have prompt_info loaded?
14:19  iaj: with only uberprompt
14:19  iaj: yeah.
14:19  iaj: Shouldn't I/
14:19 @shabble: you need to make sure that's not loading
14:20 @shabble: and then restart irssi :/
14:20  iaj: weee...
14:20  iaj: ok... sec
14:20  iaj: i won't need it anymore right?
14:20 @shabble: nope
14:20 @shabble: uberprompt is a complete replacement
14:20  iaj: kk
14:20  iaj: sec
14:21  iaj: so I won't need to change my statusbars in config file, correct?
14:22 @shabble: correct
14:24  iaj: sec ill restart

14:26  iaj: so uberprompt.pl is loaded now.
14:27 --- Channel #irssi_vim was synced in 95 seconds
14:27 @shabble: ok
14:28  iaj: what did you set your prompt to?
14:29 @shabble: the default is '[$*$uber] ' iirc
14:29 @shabble: you can change it with /set uberprompt_format
14:33  iaj: hmm I don't see the prompt :D
14:33  iaj: Oh
14:34  iaj: Seems to be working onw
14:34  iaj: now...
14:34  iaj: However the rl_history_search does nothing
14:35  iaj: got ^R bound to command history_search_start  so hitting CTRL-R should invoke something - shouldn't it?
14:35 @shabble: yes
14:35 @shabble: try typing stuff after C-r?
14:35  estragib: maybe a problem with ctrl-r register insert from vim_mode?
14:36  iaj: I need to wait a bit after C-r
14:36  iaj: that's why.
14:36  iaj: hmm I don't see the prompt :D
14:36  iaj: Ah... ok.. works :-)
14:36 @shabble: yeah, like I say, it's not currently designed to work concurrently with vim_mode
14:36 @shabble: it's a totally different script I wrote a while ago
14:36  iaj: how do I cancel the search and edit the history thing?
14:37 @shabble: C-g
14:37  iaj: C-g aborts everything no?
14:37  iaj: I want to have the line here to edit some stuff of it.
14:37 @shabble: C-e
14:38 @shabble: or tab should also work
14:39  iaj: thanks shabble - working like a charm now
14:39 @shabble: np
14:40  iaj: just that delay after hitting <C-R> is a bit 'to get used to
14:40 @shabble: eventually it'll end up in vim_mode with /?n etc
14:40 @shabble: I'm not sure why there should be a delay
14:40 @shabble: oh, it's hte imap thing from vim_mode
14:40  iaj: no clue - got nothing else bound... ahh.. yeah
14:40 @shabble: yeah, you'll have to live with that for anow
14:40  iaj: your right :)
