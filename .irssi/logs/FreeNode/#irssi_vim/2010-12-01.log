13:31  shabble: what
13:31  shabble: that shouldn't be on master
13:31 * shabble sighs
13:38  shabble: rudi_s: just chatting with iaj about the idea of having a 'partial ex mapping'
13:38  shabble: which, when invoked, inserts the $rhs into the ex buffer, and allows you to finish your command and apply with enter.
13:38  shabble: rather than needing to be a full command which is directly executed
13:39  shabble: atm, I've made a quick hack that involves ':map xx #:buffer<space>' to do it
13:39  shabble: with the # denoting that it's a partial/insert mapping
13:40  shabble: any thoughts on how to do it better? Not sure if we can detect at mapping time if the rhs is a complete command or not, so I think we need a way of distinguishing it, which is what the # is for.
