17:36  peth: shabble: following the conversation in #irssi, i just tried adding $tag to uberprompt_format out of curiosity. changing the server with ^X (either mode) doesn't update the prompt.
18:04 @shabble: hmm, that's an interesting problem
18:34 @shabble: it doesn't actually redraw if you put $tag in your normal prompt, either, until you Ctrl-L
18:34 @shabble: I'm trying to think of a nice way to support all the various expoandos, all of which have different refresh conditions
