18:59  estragib: wishlist: display own partial mappings in showcmd sb item, too
19:05 @rudi_s: estragib: Example please.
19:06  estragib: :map gt :bnext => g => sb item is empty, would help if it showed "Command (g)" like for "builtins"
19:07  estragib: so i know i'm in the middle of entering something
19:08 @rudi_s: estragib: Good idea.
19:13 @rudi_s: estragib: Btw. is the "always start in cmd mode" setting working?
19:13  estragib: perfectly
19:13 @rudi_s: Great ;-)
19:14  estragib: agreed :)
19:15 @rudi_s: :-)
