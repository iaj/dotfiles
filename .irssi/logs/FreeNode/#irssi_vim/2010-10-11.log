12:31 @shabble: rudi_s: hmm, maybe it's not too bad. I prefer the nash/anon sub approach, but there is some value in making it appear like a normal perl script, I guess.
12:31 @shabble: harder to introspect though (so things will have to register their functions, rather than being able to see hte keys of the hash)

21:34 @rudi_s: shabble: Yeah, that's true, but as the scripts will be quite small, i think that's a rather small problem. But please decide what is best, I'm happy with any working script solution ;-)
21:35 @rudi_s: (Btw. sorry for the late answer and in case I don't answer soon - my ISP is having some problems with the connection ...)
21:35 @rudi_s: shabble: Great.
21:45 @shabble: rudi_s: no probs
21:46 @shabble: also, what autocmds do we want to support?
21:48 @shabble: and, for a script function to be :map'able, do we require them to load the script manually (maybe in their conf), or do something based on filename?
21:48 @shabble: I haven't decided about either yet, so your input would be helpful :)
22:03  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 0759c5a (1 files in 1 dirs): modified rl_history_search to use uberprompt, and added INSTALL section to ... - http://bit.ly/bmiw3O
22:11  virssi-bot: irssi-scripts: master Tom Feist * 365fa46 (1 files in 1 dirs): history search now uses colour to indicate matches/no-matches - http://bit.ly/bVHz2w
22:29  iaj: Hey there!
22:29  iaj: How do I invoke that rl_history_search?
22:31 @shabble: see the comments at the top of the file
22:32 @shabble: bind something to history_search_start
