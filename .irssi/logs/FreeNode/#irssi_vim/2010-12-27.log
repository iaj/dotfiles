23:18  ArseneRe1: Where can I find the uberprompt script? A google search only leads me back to shabble's github, but I don't see it. :(
23:20  ArseneRe1: Ah, nevermind, there's a link in the script itself.
23:22  ArseneRe1: Sweet. This is so awesome. I just switched to irssi last month and this was brought me to 90% satisfication.
23:24  rudi_s: ArseneRe1: Great to hear :-) I'm glad you like it.
23:25  rudi_s: If you find any bugs, please tell us (development is a little slow at the moment .. but most things should work).
23:26  ArseneRe1: I'll be sure to. I use this work and for play.
23:26  rudi_s: ;-)
