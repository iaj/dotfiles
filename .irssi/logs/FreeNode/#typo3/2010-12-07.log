13:19  fabianfabian: I've almost narrowed it down, it has something to do with isFrontendEditingActive() in class.t3lib_tsfebeuserauth.php
13:21  fabianfabian: forcing it to return true fixes the problem

13:52  HardPhuck: that's strange
13:53  HardPhuck: domain.com/eng/page/subpage/index.html works
13:53  HardPhuck: domain.com/eng/page/index.html works too
13:53  HardPhuck: domain.com/eng/index.html gives me 404
13:53  HardPhuck: wtf?
13:54  HardPhuck: although it should give me the root page of english
14:04  Friberg: Hi there! I have an Typo3 installation (4.0.2) that I have to move to another server. The files are about 160 MB and the database is about 20 MB. Is it just to export and import database and move the files or do I have to fix something else?
14:05  Friberg: I've noticed that my images does not show up as they should, but that might be because the new server doesnt have ImageMagick. I've requested this to be installed.
14:16  MarcelT3: hi Friberg as you might now there´s TYPO3 4.4.4 out -- you should upgrade as soon as (-:
14:18  MarcelT3: essentially this is it: move db + typo3conf/uploads/fileadmin directories (and the sources, which could be downloaded as well)
14:20  Friberg: I might upgrade, that depends on what the client says, im just helping :) Anyways.. Move db, no problem, and the three directories.. No problem.. What do you mean with "and the sources"? 
14:25  MarcelT3: sources ^= t3lib typo3 dirs and index.php 
14:26  Friberg: Ok.. then the problem might just be the ImageMagick installation :) Thanks :)
14:27  Meri: Hi there !
14:29  RasmusF: Hi guys. Can you tell me where in the BE I change the ID so that my pages for the new website actualle point to the correct website (domain)
14:29  Friberg: Another thing, i just tested the new typo3 on my own server, but with the standardinstallation and preinstalled packages, i cant see anything on the acctual page.. In typo3 installation i see alot of text and stuff, but when i view the page, as it should be, i get nothing.. Any idea here? :) 
14:30  RasmusF: I have added the domain in typo3conf/localconf.php ($RootPID)
14:30  Meri: Question : is that possible to hide a FCE on a condition based on a Link which is the visitility status of a page ?
14:30  Meri: (sorry of my english :S )
14:36  Meri: this is for internal link status
14:37  MarcelT3: RasmusF: get ext:phpmyadmin and change the id of your soon to be page to the wanted value, and then go to all children pages of that page and change their pid values to the new id...
14:38  MarcelT3: RasmusF: afterwards be sure to update the reference index ;)
14:38  MarcelT3: Friberg: in cases of white screen, the first thing i do: check php and apache error logs
14:40  Friberg: MarcelT3: I do get some html in the "view source" of the page im trying to view, just that my text does not show up.. Anyhow.. i tried to create a new page, not i get "No TypoScript template found!" :)
14:42  MarcelT3: Friberg: so only the content is missing but head and body are rendered for good?
14:42  Friberg: MarcelT3: I guess so, yes.
14:42  Friberg: This might just be me, not knowing of how to administer Typo3 :)
14:42  MarcelT3: is TemplaVoila involved somehow?
14:43  RasmusF: MarcelT3: I will give it a try. Thanx
14:44  Friberg: No idea, i have the "TYPO3 Introduction Package" 
14:44  MarcelT3: didn´t take a look for the introduction package yet but as it seems most people go along with it with ease
14:45  Friberg: Yea.. My first installation here, just wanted to check it out :) 
14:52  hemant: hi
14:56  hemant: any one there....need help
15:02  hemant: my question is how to customize the order of main modules in left module panel???
15:05  hemant: I have created a main module named "global site admin" and want to place it just after web module
15:05  Friberg: MarcelT3: I'm getting "No ImageMagick install available" in the old installation, according to the serveradmin, it is installed in /usr/bin/ , it there anyway to make typo3 understand that it does exist?
15:05  MarcelT3: Friberg: did you go to the "install tool" ? found in the admin module
15:06  MarcelT3: ImageMagick Paths are tested within the install tool and there´s a function called something like...
15:07  MarcelT3: image processing where you can test all imagemagick related functions
15:07  Friberg: Yea, i cant test any of them.. but i think i see why now.. gotta check php.ini.. :P
15:10  hemant: t3lib_extMgm::addModule('txglobalsiteadminM1', '', 'after:web', t3lib_extMgm::extPath($_EXTKEY) . 'mod1/');   not working.................
15:12  pharno: someone expirienced with kp_tv_cont_slide?
15:12  hemant: according to it my module should be place after web module but nothing happening...... is there any way to place back-end module after web module
15:29  Friberg: MarcelT3: Two things.. One, Safe_mode is on globaly but turned of for my site localy, this should work, right? Secondly, ImageMagick just says "No ImageMagick install available", it just searches in /usr/local/php/bin and not /usr/bin where it is. When i write in the path, it finds it. Then i write localconf file, and next time i refresh site, its still not there.
15:29  Friberg: Any idea?
15:45  Meri: in the Typoscript of a FCE is that possible to detect if a page is hidden ?
15:53  lindbergh: hallo
15:54  lindbergh: anyone had issues with sIFR, mootools, jquery
15:54  lindbergh: I am using rgtabs and kiwi_accordion
15:54  lindbergh: and after that I am unable to see sifr output
16:02  ivaldi: hm - i should report extbase bugs to the typo3 mailing list and bugtracker - should i? (or the flow3?)
16:13  dokma: Hi guyz. I've managed to backport newer XDebug to Debian stable. It brings the ability to generate source traces with ?XDEBUG_TRACE=1. It's very handy to me. You can read more here: http://bugs.xdebug.org/view.php?id=517
16:19  Paragon40: Hello Everyone. Could some please give some advice on how to fix the following.. When a google search is submitted the returned data overflows the container. how do I keep it within the border? Please see http://www.findmestuntscooters.co.uk 
16:25  Paragon40: Hello Everyone. Could some please give some advice on how to fix the following.. When a google search is submitted the returned data overflows the container (div). how do I keep it within the border? I can submit a url where the problem can be seen more clearly!
16:25  Paragon40: Opps repeated last message ... sorry
16:26  PiMB: change your html so it takes the content into consideration
16:28  Paragon40: Hello PiMB I am using the Quicksite framework where would I need to change it so that the frame surounds the results?
16:31  resno: i was reading about typoscript and that i was a declarative use of php. can anyone show an example?
16:36  MarcelT3: Friberg: put the path to IM into the localconf.php manually  for a test... check the execute rights for the image magick scripts!
16:38  MarcelT3: Paragon40: are you saying the content overflows the div border visually?
16:38  MarcelT3: i think this better off for #css -> div { overflow: hidden; } something like that
16:44  Paragon40: MarcelT3: thanks for your reply. yes it the search responce content from google overflows the two pane module which is part of the Quicksite framework. Strangley enough when using a three pane module the content is displayed with in it that is to say the border of the module exstends around the received content.
16:46  MarcelT3: never heard about that Quicksite, so... but i sounds like a problem solvable by a nifty line of css
16:50  Paragon40: MarcelT3: I stand corrected it also overflows with the three pane module. I think your right about the CSS the google search i am employing is the "Google custom search results" typo3 plugin.
17:07  MarcelT3: re
17:11  Friberg: MarcelT3: hi again :) I did put the path to im @ localconf.php , $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['GFX']["im_path"] = '/usr/bin/';  , still doesnt work thou.. i get this in the installation tool: ImageMagick enabled: 1 , ImageMagick path: /usr/bin/ () , ImageMagic path/LZW: /usr/bin/ () 
17:11  Friberg: it cant find the imagemagick version that is.. :\
17:11  MarcelT3: where does your im version reside?
17:12  Friberg: Normaly the script would find the version and put it inside () 
17:18  MarcelT3: i mean, where on your server does the im in question reside?
17:19  MarcelT3: another thing is to switch over to GraphicsMagick which is recommendet, i think.
17:19  Friberg:  /usr/bin/
17:19  MarcelT3: so you seem to have an execute permissions problem right?
17:24  Friberg: ye, it seems so.. :) 
17:28  Friberg: MarcelT3: Btw, if i go to basic configuration, write /usr/bin/ @ search för ImageMagick then it finds convert, composite and identify version 6.2.5 
17:29  Friberg: But when i go back to "4. Image Processing" it still says "Test skipped" "Use of ImageMagick has been disabled in the configuration."
17:29  Friberg: Exactly how should my imagemagick lines look like? in the localconf.php ?
17:30  MarcelT3: well if the basic settings find IM correctly, have a look at "All Configuration" where the use of IM could be set to 0
17:31  MarcelT3: just to remember: you should upgrade the whole system asap i only can talk for install tools after 4.3
17:38  Friberg: MarcelT3: ok. I just tried doing something like shell_exec and system for convert, and it works, i do get the version.. so.. :) 
17:47  Friberg: lol, i made it work.. i think.. 
17:51  Friberg: i was screwing around with class.tx_install.php and changed some stuff about safe_mode, the server has safe_mode, but locally turned off for my site, this doesnt seem to work for typo3. 
17:51  Friberg: anyhow, now i got ImageMagick path/LZW: /usr/bin/ (6.2.5)
17:52  Friberg: thou ImageMagick path: /usr/bin () without / and then it gets broken again
17:53  kevke: Hy ppl, I moved my t3 install to a new server. I think I did a thorough job. 1st I copied the Filesystem, 2nd created a database 3rd poppulated the database with the previous dump from the old site. Now I somehow only get a white page. Any ideas please, I am desperate
17:54  kevke: j #android
17:56  kevke: sorry this what not intended
18:01  resno: kevke: are all the paths correct?
18:02  kevke: I suppose so
18:03  kevke: well I hope so, I must say
18:06  resno: im just reaching for what i think it could be that or htaccess file problem
18:06  kevke: Maybe I should try inserting the database by hand. 
18:13  kevke: I do not feel offended btw resno, I would ask the same
18:14  resno: kevke: i know very little about t3, so im going to the usual things. that would stop it from working.
18:16  kevke: alright pal
18:20  kevke: I suppose its a permissions thing *google* permissions, move, typo3 *google*
18:23  infojunky: in page view, what denotes a branch in the tree to being expanded when the next branch up is expanded?  so if I have  cnd / 1 /  archive  for a tree, ,
18:23  infojunky: archive will show up expanded if I expand cnd
18:30  infojunky: or to make it more complicated,  under cnd/  I have paths 1-10 , which all have archive paths under them and years (ex. cnd/4/archive/2004 ). yet only  cnd/7  and cnd/9 will fully expand out in page view to the full listing ( cnd/7/archive/2004 )
18:36  kevke: It still is a mystery
18:37  infojunky: ?!?
18:39  kevke: As I stated above, I am triing to safe a site, which is somewhat faulty and can't get it to run on the new server
19:24  MarcelT3: kevke: white site stil?
19:25  kevke: ya
19:25  MarcelT3: kevke: check out the error logs for apache and even more promising: php
19:25  kevke: cheking
19:25 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
19:26  MarcelT3: if you have NO content in your frontend that´s nine of ten times just php throwing some fatal error and suppressing the output in frontend
19:32  kevke: hmm: [Tue Dec 07 18:54:14 2010] [notice] mod_fcgid: process 9095 going graceful shutdown, sending SIGTERM
19:33  kevke: Those errors are not correlating to typo3
19:34  MarcelT3: well, at least you told us that you´re useing php in fast-cgi mode :D
19:35  MarcelT3: maybe you ran into permissions problems? i´d guess you have stuff like suexec active...
19:36  kevke: yeah
19:36  kevke: it came along with the naked install
19:37  kevke: Is there a "permission denied" log somewhere?
19:43  kevke: Can't find a permission error anywhere
