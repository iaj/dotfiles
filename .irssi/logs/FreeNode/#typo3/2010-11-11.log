12:33  iaj: lo there .. i got a task to solve... its about POWERMAIL plugin used on -USE ContentElement FROM PAGE- .. when I try to reuse powermail forms on different sides by that choice.. checkboxes aren't getting submitted
12:33  iaj: did anyone occur that problem, or mb know a solution?
12:33  iaj: we got like 20 employees and I don't wanna have to have 20 different powermail forms with the same content?
12:50  saedelaere: hi
12:51  saedelaere: can i change permissions in fileadmin for folders so other backend users can't rename, move or delete them? 
12:52  saedelaere: I want to do this only for some folders. not for all of them.
12:55  Denyerek: not sure the filelist module supports permissions like that, but I could be very wrong.
12:59  CaptainChaos: hi :) how can i set that when a user creates a page, this page automatically is owned by a given group?
13:00  CaptainChaos: or better, if a member of a group creates a page, that page is owned by that group?
13:01  escapedcat: CaptainChaos: TCEMAIN.permissions.groupid = groupid
13:02  CaptainChaos: set this in the groups tsconfig?
13:03  koen: @_Mhoram_: sorry, had a phonecall
13:03  koen: If made a page with the plain HTML in it (see http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/testpage/)
13:04  koen: On this page you see the image. That same image is supposed to be in the right column on http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/ueber-uns/management/
13:05  _Mhoram_: So you are putting the image in the right column, can you try and put the image in a different area?
13:06  koen: Hi, that does not matter, because images on other pages are also not working any more. The only images that keep on working are the images on the homepage
13:07  saedelaere: Denyerek, yes i fear the the filelist module does not support this. the problem is there are some super editors that have access to most parts in fileadmin/ if one if these users renames a folder that is part of another filemount this filemount is screwed. 
13:08  saedelaere: only thing i could is to reomve permissions for folder operations
13:09  saedelaere: for all backend users. but then it is also no longer possible to create new folders which can be very handy because of clarity
13:09  saedelaere: sigh
13:11  _Mhoram_: Are you using Templavoila koen?
13:11  koen: @_Mhoram_: I
13:11  koen: @_Mhoram_: No not for this site. We are using automaketemplate
13:11  _Mhoram_: ah
13:11  _Mhoram_: I don't really use that method 
13:12  _Mhoram_: I would assume it's something in the typoscript, do you have different ts setup code for the home page and for the other pages?
13:12  koen: No we do not use that anymore also, but the content gets replaced in the HTML template using typoscript lib.content < styles.content.getRight
13:13  koen: No we use the same setup code for all pages
13:15  koen: and now I have cleared the cache in typo3 and the image is back again
13:16  _Mhoram_: Has it happened  before? or is it fixed?
13:16  koen: Could the order of including of templates also matter
13:17  koen: It is a problem that is there for already 6 weeks and we are almost out of options for the fix
13:17  _Mhoram_: Possibly, as I said though I'm not familiar with the non TV way of doing things
13:17  _Mhoram_: Have you tried sytematically removing bits of typoscript to see if it changes anything, this is what I do If i can't narrow down the problem.
13:18  _Mhoram_: Also have you tried disabling all extensions one by one and testing to see if it's fixed each time
13:18  _Mhoram_: The strangest problems can be caused by seemingly trivial extensions
13:18  koen: Maybe there is another thing. We are running 4 different sites on that typo3 install (teleforwarding.de, teleforwarding.es, teleforwarding.com and teleforwarding.nl and teleforewarding.co.uk). They are all using the same image base
13:19  koen: @_Mhoram_: I would like to do that, but we cannot reproduce the problem in our testserver and changing the production environment is not something we can do.
13:19  _Mhoram_: Oh I see, how frustrating
13:20  _Mhoram_: If the codes exactly the same, it could be a server setting
13:20  koen: We are also using sendCacheHeaders=1
13:21  koen: Maybe I should disable that way of caching
13:21  _Mhoram_: Try anything at this stage
13:21  koen: :)
13:21  _Mhoram_: If you have a network tech who knows his stuff ask about the different settings on the live server and what might be the problem
13:24  koen: We have been talking for hours with our hostings provider and we did find some things that were not correct (live user rights on filesystem etc). But all our other sites are also running at their servers and there we have no problem at all.
13:26  aterriblechaos: koen: quite shure that this has nothing to do with the provider, also when calling your page with ?no_cache=1 the images are working, it has to be a TYPO3 configuration problem
13:27  koen: @aterriblechaos: if I do http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/ueber-uns/management/?no_cache=1 the image is working and if I do http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/ueber-uns/management/ the image is not working
13:27  koen: So caching problem after all
13:28  koen: But what can I be doing wrong then
13:30  MindSpark: hi, can someone tell me if there's a way to find out if there are unused images in the upload dir ?
13:31  MindSpark: also is it possible to check if a certain page is referenced anywhere ? so let's say before I move it, I can see that ?
13:32  aterriblechaos: koen: hm, now for me http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/ueber-uns/management/ works too ...  i've seen you disabled sending the cache headers, lets lookt if that was your problem
13:33  koen: ls
13:33  aterriblechaos: koen: btw ... disable directory listing on public servers  ( http://www.htmlite.com/HTA011.php )
13:35  PiMB: @ koen, still not working mate?
13:35  koen: thanx for the top. We disables directory listing
13:36  koen: @PiMB, no, but we have disabled cache headers now. Actually when images where nog showing, addung ?no_cache=1 did show the images (thanks to aterriblechaos)
13:37  PiMB: a okay
13:37  PiMB: but still the problem resides
13:37  PiMB: and it's still a strange problem
13:37  koen: So maybe that has been the problem all together (still puzzeled why we do not see that behavior on other sites)
13:37  aterriblechaos: has to do with cache headers .. koen: you sayed that the image where working for some time after clearing the cache?
13:38  koen: Yes
13:38  aterriblechaos: maybe 2 hours (your cache timeout, sorry)
13:38  aterriblechaos: ?
13:39  koen: Yes it looks like it, but as we have not been monitoring the whole day, we are not sure that it was always after the cache period
13:41  koen: Should you then not use SendCacheheaders in a typical Typo3 environment?
13:42  koen: @MindSpark: Do a DB check on Database relations and you should get a list of diles with no reference
13:42  aterriblechaos: sendcacheheaders should not harm, imho its cache_period .. but seems like a bug, you should never have empty image blocks
13:43  koen: Oke,
13:43  koen: we will keep our fingers crossed for the following hours and see if the images are staying. If this helps, I would like to thank you all in advance !!
13:44  _Mhoram_: Good luck
13:44  koen: thnkx
13:46  MindSpark: koen, can you hint me to how to do that ?
13:55  koen: @MinsSpark: sign in to typo3 backend with an admin user. Under Admin Tools you have an DB check option. There you can select "Database relations" from the dropdown
14:14  MindSpark: koen, perfect ! thanks
14:14  koen: no problem :)
14:23  koen: ls
14:38  lindbergh: hello chan
14:39  lindbergh: anyone will to help with advice....related to extension programming?
14:44  lindbergh: I want to have backend ability to insert from backend food product information
14:44  lindbergh: short description
14:45  lindbergh: I want to add db tables which will have product id, product category/typ product short info, ingredients info
14:45  lindbergh: and I want somehow to populate that tables from the backend (not using phpmyadmin extension or something similar)
14:46  aterriblechaos: lindbergh: extension kickstarter helps with that
14:46  lindbergh: I want to have few input fields: product name, product description, and for category I want to have ability to select n out of m options
14:46  lindbergh: multi select
14:46  lindbergh: aterriblechaos: I know for kickstarter....
14:47  lindbergh: what I wanted to ask
14:47  lindbergh: is 
14:47  lindbergh: anyone have advice
14:47  lindbergh: how to make this....few steps explanation
14:47  lindbergh: I guess I need to make "Backend Module" extension
14:47  lindbergh: right?
14:48  DNukem: Is there an extension similar to file_explorer, but maintained at the current time and available for typo version >4.4? I need to give Users the ability to up and download files in a comfortable way.
14:48  lindbergh: DNukem: try DAM
14:49  lindbergh: anyone?
14:53  DNukem: lindbergh This would be a frontend plugin, if get your idead right. You want to create Datasets in the tables through the backend, and present it then in way to the website visitors?
14:53  lindbergh: exactly
14:53  lindbergh: if visitor click on some products
14:53  DNukem: FE Plugin.
14:54  lindbergh: in the link I will have product id as get param
14:54  DNukem: And get information from your table? Details and stuff?
14:54  lindbergh: and regarding that id 
14:54  lindbergh: I want to present different values in some page content element in the template I already prepared
14:55  lindbergh: so FE plugin is idea?
14:55  lindbergh: but
14:56  lindbergh: how I will make multiselect option
14:56  lindbergh: ie. I want to select 3 out of 6 categories
14:57  DNukem: There is an old wiki, which sometimes proofs worthy if asking elementary things (at least for me, who is up to ext programming only 6 months so far) http://wiki.typo3.org/Extension_Development,_using_Flexforms.
14:58  DNukem: Or http://wiki.typo3.org/Extension_Developers_Guide and http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/doc_core_api/4.3.0/view/toc/0/   the core api docu of course
14:59  DNukem: lindbergh, I'll guess you have to hand over a list of categories you want to display, and then code something to select it proper.
15:27  ndee: can it be, that gifbuilder still just uses 256 colors? I added the gdlib_png = 1 but the colors are still in 256
15:39  ndee: how can I create an image with rounded corners? Is this only possible trough GIFBUILDER or can I also use some native convert commands?
16:02  aterriblechaos: ndee: you need to set png_truecolor too,i would make roundet corners with gifbuilder but there are also javascript solutions like http://jquery.malsup.com/corner/
16:02  ndee: aterriblechaos, ah, gonna try that truecolor trick, thanks for the hint .)
16:21  ries: Anybody know google a bit? on the custom results page I need to remove the advertisements
16:32  aterriblechaos: ries: isnt that removed when you pay the 100$/year ?  http://www.google.com/cse/manage/create
16:35  Denyerek: ndee - GIF is only 256 colour
16:35  Denyerek: not sure about gifbuilder, I've used it to generate JPGs before
16:36  Denyerek: As for rounded corners, if they're going over a solid background I have some TS for that I nicked from Typo3Wizard
16:36  Denyerek: if you want to make them transparent, though, I'm not so sure.
16:36  Denyerek: Ries : The ads come out in a predictable format, you could use CSS or JS to hide them.
16:37  Denyerek: Though that's likely a direct violation of their TOS
16:54  ries: aterriblechaos: I have no clue... I usually don't do google
16:54  ries: will read it and thanks for the link
16:57  _Mhoram_: Yes the ads are removed when you pay for it
16:57  _Mhoram_: Its a sliding scale of cost
16:58  _Mhoram_: starts pretty cheap, the lowest level is capped at returning 1000 search results or 100,000 page impressions I think but the numbers are probably wrong
16:59  _Mhoram_: I had to get this info from a Google tech support guy because  I thought the sliding cost depended on the amount of pages of your website Google had indexed
17:03  ries: _Mhoram_: cock.... why do they have to make things so complicated
17:04 --- Prot0 is now known as Prot0|off
17:05  _Mhoram_: yeah, I don't really know. But unless you have a fairly big website the lowest cost option will do I'd say. We moved a client to Google search from the Indexed search extension because it was killing our server
17:05  _Mhoram_: The index tables were so big it was chugging along 
17:09  ries: _Mhoram_: these people have 25000 news entries in there system, for me big would be 1million pages?
17:09  ries: But I have no idea what google things about that
17:11  _Mhoram_: Well the first limit is the 1000 results, that just means you get a maximum of 1000 results (10 pages). That should be plenty but the next level up still doesnt cost a lot of money
17:11  _Mhoram_: However for such a big site if the search used a lot it might reach the page impression cap 
17:11  ries: I think we would be fine with 1000 results...
17:12  _Mhoram_: So they should be aware that an additional cost will occur if that happens
17:12  _Mhoram_: I think :)
17:12  ries: I am trying to see on the google website, but there is no mentioned on any limits, and also not a phone number I can call for assistence
17:12  _Mhoram_: They don't do phone support
17:12  _Mhoram_: I was so annoyed I just signed up for one, once you pay you get access to decent support
17:13  ries: it's like paying to get into the supprtmarked just to see what they sell, right?
17:13  _Mhoram_: kind of, yes
17:13  _Mhoram_: here's a link to my support request on the help forum
17:14  _Mhoram_: http://www.google.nr/support/forum/p/customsearch/thread?tid=1ef426dd40a7115a&hl=en
17:14  _Mhoram_: So try there if you want, but it might take a while to get an answer
17:16  ries: _Mhoram_: this is helpfull to : http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/customsearch/thread?tid=499cfb02b538960c&hl=en
17:19  _Mhoram_: It is interesting, I think that Google do indeed price like the last reply suggested now
17:36  ries: _Mhoram_: seems like that CSE has a lot of limitations unless you open your wallet
17:36  hagus: As Joomla is a basically a blogging system, adding a succession of new short articles (really just paragraphs) causes automatic pagination, so that new pages are created as articles flow in.   Does the blogging extension in Typo3 have an auto-pagination facility?
17:36  ries: I am trying to pursue my client to use Solr
17:36  ries: hagus: if it's the one based on tt_news, then yes... tt_news by itself has pagination of articles or lists of blog entries
17:36  hagus: ah - ok ty ries :)
17:38  _Mhoram_: I haven't looked into Solr, I just had to find a quick alternative to Indexed search t ostop the server from exploding. If I can squeeze in some research time I'll look at that
17:39  hagus: I am in the VERY early stages of moving from a Joomla-based site (inherited) to a Typo3 one.  However, as the Typo3 one is still being used, I am exploring what bits that I can transfer that would be easier to handle with Typo3.  I am very familiar with using tt_news - and wish I had thought of it before I asked the question :-)
17:45  ndee: anyone did a RSS feed with tt_news? http://www.rainer-grundel.de/wissensdb/typo3/module/artikel/article/rssxml_newsfeeds_erstellen.html <-- that's the guide I'm following but my page doesn't generate XML but a normal LIST view :/
17:46  ries: hagus: so, what are you doing with Doomla then??? :D
17:47  ries: ndee: I did, it sucks
17:47  ries: I had to patch tt_news even to support some features I needed
17:47  ndee: ries: hehe, if you say it, it's true :D 
17:47  ndee: damn :/
17:47  ndee: well, I hope I still can get it running somehow
17:48  Denyerek: hey ries, you there? 
17:51  ndee: which CODE do I have to select in the dropdown?
17:52  ries: Denyerek: yes I am
17:58  hagus: ries - I am Communications Convener (unpaid part-time post) of the Presbytery of Glasgow.  Shortly before I took over in that role, which includes much more than website, they had already picked and set up a Joomla site.  However, I am increasingly cheesed off with it and want to gradually move over to Typo3.  The presbytery has 140 or so ministers, similar number of elders, and retired folk and other bring the total around the 400 mark.  Currently
17:58  hagus: only the 140 or so are 'users' and have email addresses to which their accounts are linked.   I am looking at how to migrate from Joomla to Typo3 but my skill-set is such that I will have to do that over a period of months as I copy stuff and start again. 
17:59  hagus: One of our people has decided he wants to have tips on mission and wants five sections with various tidbits of information being added to each one from time to time.
18:00  ries: hagus: well, keep hanging out in this room for sure... there are a lot of knowledgeable people including me hehehehe
18:01  ries: hagus: in terms of security and shielding of part of sites to different people, TYPO3 will do very well
18:01  hagus: I am currently showing him how to do this in Joomla but I have already started a complementary (typo3 based) site, which I am hoping he will choose to use instead.
18:01  ries: make sure you set it up using templavoila... give you a lot of flexebility
18:01  hagus: I use Webempowered Church customisation of typo3
18:03  hagus: http://presbyteryofglasgow.org.uk is the Joomla site and http://webempoweredchurch.org is where I get my typo3 from - it is templavoila-based - and has connections with Busy Noggin. 
18:04  ries: I think WEC uses TV to... good WEC is very powerwull
18:06  hagus: For my own church website, http://cardonaldparishchurch.org/main/ I appreciate the benefit of what WEC has done.  Before WEC,  I struggled to get Typo3 going out of the box.
18:08  ries: hagus: typo3 is a Bi*** to get running out of the box for newbiews
18:09  hagus: Yeah - it is.  However, once set up, the logical structure of the backend makes it so easy to find everything.
18:10  hagus: It is more intuitive to me than any other CMS that I have tried.
18:17  ries: hagus: I totally agree
18:19  hagus: Do you use typo3 professionally or as a hobbyist or a mixture of both?
18:21  hagus: I am a hobbyist - I use typo3 for fun but also to benefit the church.
18:22  hagus: I also plowter with php and ruby and muck about with stuff like symfony and doctrine etc.
18:23  hagus: However, my knowledge level is not very high on any of these.
18:23  hagus: Normally, I learn enough to get my by.
18:24  hagus: Sometimes, by the time I return to an issue, I have forgotten what I learned or programming has progressed beyond what I used to know :)
18:24 * hagus is old
18:27  ries: hagus: I am using TYPO3 profesionally, I am a freelance software engineer and TYPO3 is one of the things that makes money for me
18:32  hagus: If I were not a church minister, I think I would have opted to have been doing something in the programming line - however my wife tells me that I would be too slow to be of any use commerically lol
18:34  hagus: However, I have always had a fascination with logic and maths and sequencing etc.  So OOP has an appeal for me but I still think in a sequential kind of way - so my grasp of it is shaky but it works - mostly.
18:34  ries: hagus: hahah... can I (and she...) conclude that you are fast enough to be a church minister??
18:34  ries: hagus: with sequential you mean procedural?
18:35  hagus: I tend to be involved in several projects at the same time but most of them - I try to ensure - do not have a time limit.  
18:35  hagus: yes, ries - I mean procedural
18:36  ries: hagus: both of there ad and dis-advantages...
18:37  ries: The dis-advantage of OOP is that, specially in teh PHP world a class use used as a bucked of functions, it' snot pure OOP.
18:37  ries: OOP is very difficult and needs a specific mindset..
18:37  ries: The advantage of OOP is that it's very powerfull once you get the hang of it
18:38  hagus: I tend to use a mixture but when I do ruby rails - then I kind of get pushed into a particular direction.  Sometimes I wish I had started off with Ruby - have been using PHP - which is more forgiving - for too long to change.
18:38  ries: hagus: Well, using OOP doesn't force you to do this or that in a specific way...
18:39  ries: I don't do Ruby... I do Java, PHP and C++
18:39  hagus: No but it does force you into thinking in a particular way.
18:39  ries: yes, that's true.
18:39  hagus: Or invite you to do so at any rate.
18:40  hagus: Java is different from Javascript, am I right?
18:40  ries: hagus: yes, a lot different
18:41  ries: only the part 'java' is the same I think :D
18:43  hagus: Maybe, when I retire - I might take up Java or C++ to see what I have been missing :)
18:44  ries: hagus: like you said, PHP is like McDonalds, you go there because it's easy and cheap food.... but bad for your health
18:45  ries: Java and c++ are like good restaurants, it just takes a while to appreciate good food
18:48  hagus: Interesting comparison.
18:48  hagus: I like it.
19:12  Avalarion: Hey ho, does some one know a way to link to the current viewed tt_news single?
19:19  teppi|work: Avalarion, http://privatepaste.com/5701763807
19:23  Avalarion: teppi|work: That does not solve anything O.o http://privatepaste.com/baf3082363 That's what I tried, but it does not work either...
19:24  teppi|work: Avalarion, of course Avalarion i did'nt wanted to spoonfeed you ;)
19:24  teppi|work: but i see you found a similiar way
19:26  Avalarion: teppi|work: *G* I tried it... But with my way, where is my error? I cannot see it...
19:26  teppi|work: Avalarion, additionalParams.cObject.10 = TEXT .. adn so on?
19:27  teppi|work: COA is a Content Object Array ..
19:28  Avalarion: mom, lost myself in TS
19:29  Avalarion: I could delete this line I think...
19:31  Avalarion: quite interesting
19:31  teppi|work: Avalarion, http://privatepaste.com/63679e167e
19:31  teppi|work: something like this i think
19:31  teppi|work: dunno
19:34  teppi|work: ah there is a pipe-symbol missing in the wrap
19:34  teppi|work: typolink.additionalParams.wrap = &tx_ttnews[tt_news]=|
19:35  Avalarion: no it works! My most Problem was that I did not overwrite my pageMark -.-
19:36  teppi|work: :p
19:48  Avalarion: teppi|work: Do you have a minute or two for another problem?
19:48  teppi|work: jup
19:49  Avalarion: http://privatepaste.com/3d07e1c7d8
19:49  Avalarion: trying to do:
19:49  Avalarion: 1. Line: Set my Header to the News Title
19:49  Avalarion: 2. Line: get Keywords of the news and set it to the meta
19:50  Avalarion: I have to think different... Its the same problem I think
19:51  teppi|work: http://www.tomalo-blog.de/
19:51  teppi|work: the code there looks a little bit different
19:51  teppi|work: maybe try this
20:00  Avalarion: -.- My Keywords now are: DB:tt_news:9:keywords trying next...
