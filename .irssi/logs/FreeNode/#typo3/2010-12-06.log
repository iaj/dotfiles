09:34  ndee: is it somehow possible that the sviewpointer in tt_news starts at 1 and not at 0?
09:36  Silke: Morning :-) I'd like to make a page and its menu item accessible when a custom variable in the frontend session is set. Is there a way to do this?

12:06  daReaper: i use "   prepend.value.case = lower" to cast a string to lowercase. Is there a similar function to remove all non-alpha characters from a string?
12:10  PiMB: amilionthingstod, you don't need to, but I do it for some people :) it's just my code

14:23  saedelaere: hi
14:23  saedelaere: i imported some pages from an pld typo3 
14:23  saedelaere: s/pld old
14:24  saedelaere: there we had two languages Default (german) and english
14:25  saedelaere: in our new Typo3 it is Default (german) and English (capitalised)
14:25  saedelaere: after the import the dropdown menu in "Make new translation of this page" shows English and english. 
14:26  saedelaere: i suppose this is not good. I searched through all of my template files but there the only Lang is English.
14:29  saedelaere: How do I get rid of this lowercased written english? Hopefully I did not overwrite something important
14:31  saedelaere: Ahh website Language. Got it. puuh
15:08  ndee: does it make sense to use innodb for a large tt_news table?
15:10  danielawaranie: config.locale_all: list of allowed values? Please send me a link.
15:11  danielawaranie: i know the "TYPO3 list" is different from the "Language Tag Defintition" (ISO) in some cases, but today i do not find the page/list via google - please help

15:33  sorenmalling: Hi, can some one tell me why the override doesn't "override" the default value - the "headerimage" field is a input field with a string http://pastie.org/1352206
15:34  sorenmalling: tca for the field is pasted here: http://pastie.org/1352211
16:17  aterriblechaos: sorenmalling: override should work in your example .. i think you need to add the path to the file to override
16:19  sorenmalling: aterriblechaos: The thing is that the client should be able to change the image from the field in page properties. But, for a test i tried to replace "field = " with "data = fileadmin/files/topbilleder/top-box-hands.png" which is a existing image and also tried with "value= fileadmin/files/topbilleder/top-box-hands.png" but no luck . I think my override is wrong and I'll need to get back to tsref :)
16:24  sorenmalling: aterriblechaos: Wuhu, got it working!
16:24  sorenmalling: used "data = page:FIELDNAME" instead
16:25  Fruchthoernschen: grml
16:25  Fruchthoernschen: << has upgrade to TYPO3 4.4.4 to get an faster backend ;) and also upgrade templavoila and what's that for an AMAZING effect ;) now I must search the pencil 
16:26  aterriblechaos: sorenmalling: ok, you are probably using templavoila ;)
16:26  sorenmalling: Indeed :)
16:26  Fruchthoernschen: hmm knows someone if there is an Config-Option/setting where I can disable this effect? 
16:47 --- boonkerz_ is now known as boonkerz
16:52  Denyerek: search the penicl?
16:52  Denyerek: Fruchthoernschen: I have no idea what you're talking about :(
17:00  Fruchthoernschen: Denyerek, it was only a small joke about the new effect from templavoila. the pencil is the icon for edit an Content Element. Now I must first wait till the Content-Element Icon Bar is displayed and then I can move my mouse to the right position to click on the pencil to edit it. 
17:03 --- boonkerz_ is now known as boonkerz
17:10  Denyerek: Ahhh
17:10  Denyerek: because the icons only show when you're hovering in the element.
17:10  Denyerek: yes, yes I understand now :)
17:10  Denyerek: I had noticed that too, but I guess force of habit sends my mouse to the right place already :)
17:11  Fruchthoernschen: hehe yes ;) hmpf I don't know what the devs have thinked with this feature ;)
17:11  Fruchthoernschen: I think I should write them 
17:13  Fruchthoernschen: my backend looks like an eventing in the Christmas market. Everywhere (where my mouse/me is) it starts to flash/blink^^
17:26  foertel: heyho you guys
17:30  kevke: Hey ppl, As some of you know, I have issues with dropped entities. did anyone have related bugs and how did you fix them? My cause of action is a bit radical, and so I search for further ideas. 
17:41  Denyerek: Fruchthoernschen: I think I agree. there is a lot of flickering in a backend with many FCEs, it almost looks broken.
17:45  Fruchthoernschen: yeah ;) good to hear, thath I'm not complete alone ;)
17:56  foertel: mh anyone experiencing heavy performance issues with the new workspaces in 4.5?
17:56  foertel: when inside a workspace everything gets terribly slow and chrome/safari/firefox4 take up to 100% cpu for like 10 seconds
17:56  Celt: hi, why i can't login in BE with midori browser, "Your browser version looks incompatible with this TYPO3 version! " ? not tested ?
17:56  foertel: seems something is wrong with the JS
17:58  Celt: or is it a question of religion ?
17:58  foertel: o_O
17:58  foertel: think it does not matter who you pray to ;)
17:59  Celt: :)
18:00  foertel: what's technical possible will work most likely
18:40  Orange_dwarf: Hello all
18:43  Orange_dwarf: Can I hit you with a question: I'm using th_specialelements. I've set up cHash, but the cache_pages-table is filling with INT_SCRIPT-references. This results in missing entries for indexed_search. Can anyone give some advise?
18:44  Fruchthoernschen: hmm
18:44  Fruchthoernschen: Orange_dwarf, wait I will see what th_specialelements is
18:46  Fruchthoernschen: hmm
