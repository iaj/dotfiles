14:49  MateMK4: soee: thanks :)
14:50  MateMK4: do you maybe know.. is it a problem to setup real url a bit later, when the pages are already made?
14:50  MateMK4: does it change anything? except for the obvious fact, that urls are nice :)
14:50  soee: no its not a big problem
14:51  soee: basicly you just have to install extension enable it in page config
14:52  MateMK4: nice :)
15:02  soee: MateMK4: and what about tt_news translations ?
15:03  MateMK4: soee: I don't use tt_news 
15:04  MateMK4: do you maybe know about the preview icons for the FCEs

15:10  Fruchthoernschen: Hey ho
15:11  Fruchthoernschen: Does someone know How to disable the HoverEffect of Templavoila for the Content Elements? I don't like to wait till I can click on the edit/remove/hide â€¦ Icons/Functions for the content Elements. It's so o annoying. 
15:12  soee: no idea tbh but its a good question :)
15:12  Fruchthoernschen: hmpf damn
15:13  Fruchthoernschen: I want to know what the boys and girl from Templavoila have thinked as they have implemented this "feature". 
15:13  Fruchthoernschen: ;)
15:13  HardPhuck: i don't think it's TV
15:14  HardPhuck: the same happens on sites without TV (i think)
15:14  Fruchthoernschen: Looks a bit like, ohh look here, I have discovered an javascript framework and their funny features ;)
15:15  Fruchthoernschen: hmm I think it is from Templavoila, but hmm must check it could be that I search on the wrong place. 
15:15  Fruchthoernschen: but I hate this effect ;)
15:19  snoy_ms: Fruchthoernschen: the tv team try to get the same look&feel like normal typo3. This hover effect is a default one.
15:20  snoy_ms: Fruchthoernschen: did you check version 4.5 without tv ?
15:23  Fruchthoernschen: hm not yet, I must check it out 
15:23  Kevke: I think I need some insight. I copied a t3 installlation to a new server. so far everything is working fine, however realspeaking url is not working properly. Instead of domain.com/news/rigth i get domain.com/21545/ the number 21545 corresponds to domain.com/index.php?id=21545 Has anyone seen this issue before?
15:24  HardPhuck: you copied an existing installation?
15:24  Kevke: yes
15:25  HardPhuck: then i think your .htaccess file is missing on the new server
15:25  Kevke: checking
15:26  Kevke: htaccess is present
15:27  HardPhuck: and you have the same realurl settings and files?
15:27  Kevke: I suppose so
15:28  HardPhuck: did you move the site?
15:28  Fruchthoernschen: snoy_ms looks like TYPO3 4.4.4 changes, I read have found the quickstart tutorial with screenshots and there is also the same behavor to see.. hmm okay good to know, search on an different place
15:29  Kevke: completelly
15:30  HardPhuck: same apache config?
15:30  Kevke: I don't think so actually
15:31  soee: whats the best way to localize tt_news ?
15:31  soee: is there any way without creating aditional sysfolders ?
15:32  Kevke: where do I find the corresponding configuration file for apache?
15:33  HardPhuck: depends on the server
15:34  HardPhuck: usually /etc/apache/
15:34  HardPhuck: or /etc/apache2/
15:37  Kevke: What is it, I shall look for?
15:57  cooperbear: Hi guys. I have a HMENU/TMENU that I generate. And I'd like the menu to -not- generate items in the menu that have not been translated in the menu. How do I do this?
15:58  soee: bye bye
16:06  cooperbear: I've set config.sys_language_overlay = hideNonTranslated, but that doesn't seem to work on its own?
16:18  cooperbear: Ah, solved. Needed the following line in localconf.php :) $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['hidePagesIfNotTranslatedByDefault'] = 1;
16:26 --- boonkerz_ is now known as boonkerz
16:46 --- nej_ is now known as nej
16:50  daeli: hi there, i want to output a menu and want to append a slash corresponding to the position of the current item
16:50  daeli: you know - the 5th entry gets 5 slashes appended
16:50  daeli: is there a way to do this?
