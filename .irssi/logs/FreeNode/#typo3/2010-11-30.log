09:08  dc: hello fellow t3ers ^^
09:09  dc: i have a problem with calendar base and wondered if anyone has / had the same problem
09:11  dc: the setup is as follows: users in general storage, calendar storage as sub-dir, calendar plugin set up on page(s) with startingpoint 'general storage', infinitely recursive
09:13  dc: how it should be: the user can log in the frontend, switch to the calendar page, and add an event
09:18  dc: ... the back-button on the mouse should be disabled for this site... -.- .. anyways....
09:18  dc: how it should be: user logs in, switches to cal page, adds event
09:18  dc: how it is: user logs in, switches to cal page, green '+' symbol show up, url seems to be right (http://domain.tld/index.php?id=80&no_cache=1&tx_cal_controller[gettime]=0700&tx_cal_controller[getdate]=20101102&tx_cal_controller[lastview]=view-month%7Cpage_id-80%7C%7Cview-list%7Cpage_id-80%7C%7Cview-month%7Cpage_id-80&tx_cal_controller[view]=create_event)
09:18  dc: but when 'create_event' template is called, 'view_month' template is shown.. :|
09:18  dc: any ideas?
09:30  kevke: Trying desperately to resolve a huge problem: An extension only produces html output.  It did not do this before, just started to. Is there a simple way to troubleshoot this?
09:31  Celt: утра
09:44  soee: kevke, maybe u have change some extension settings, anyway what extension ?
09:47  kevke: a custom article ext. however, it just stoped working. It worked for almost 4 month
09:54  soee: kevke, no updates or anything like that ?
09:55  kevke: nothing
09:57  kevke: I have just seen, that if I make a new CE, it is rendered correctly and shown right
10:01  kevke: Do you have a logical explanation for all CEs of one certain ext are suddenly broken and if you make a new CE of this particular extension it is rendered correctly?
10:05  mgotta: hallo in die runde
10:07  dc: hello mgotta - i think this channel is all english, damit dich auch jeder versteht ;)
10:07  mgotta: ;) didnt had my first coffee... its too early
10:08  dc: ^^
10:10  kevke: I would not kümmer mich about Denglish oder even Deutsch
10:10  kevke: Morgen anyway
10:14  aterriblechaos: good morning #typo3
10:18  dc: Extension: cal (Calendar Base); 'Create Event' is not working - month view is displayed instead -> has anyone had this problem before? *stuck*
10:35  soee: never used cal :)
10:40  mgotta: i'm using calendar... 
10:44  dc: @mgotta i suppose you use the same ext as i am.. "Name: Calendar Base; Ext-Key: cal; Version: 1.3.3"
10:50  soee: what was the TS code to add page title as atagparam to typolink ?
10:51  mgotta: @dc ext key is calendar .... its i thing an extended version of the cal
10:57  dc: @mgotta - checked it in the rep -> totally different ext ;)
10:58  mgotta: @dc not the best one though... have to use it because a customer is using it since years and has a lot of dates in the database... no chance to change that
11:01 --- Serpiente_ is now known as Serpiente
11:01  kevke: I hope noone would mind, if I repeat my initial question: Since yesterday, our site, or much more one particular extension acts weird. Instead of proper text, html syntax is rendered. This problem occurs within two separate installations (both same typo3/template/extensions) If a new ce is created, it is shown how it is supposed to be (without html coding) Please help me out with this one
11:02  marcuslind: Hi guys. I a client of mine created a lot of references from one pagecontent, but when she update the original pagecontent the references dont update. Why is this?
11:02  dc: @mgotta .. i noticed.. last update in 2005 .. the cal ext is currently still in development..
11:03  mgotta: @dc i know ;)
11:03  mgotta: @dc its a lot of tweaking... 
11:03  dc: @kevke have you looked through the typo3.net forum yet?
11:05  kevke: yes, not found anything useful, but if you have an idea where to look for, shoot!
11:05  kevke: In this matter, look here http://www.proserion.com/index.php?id=1561
11:13  aterriblechaos: kevke: how do this records look in the database? i mean, compare the working one with the not working
11:14  soee: marcuslind, are you sure there are references not copies ?
11:14  marcuslind: soee: Yes. but could it be the cache?
11:14  marcuslind: Is references cached?
11:15  marcuslind: so that if I update the original, I need to clear the cache? That's not good for the editors of the site who dont have access to "clear cache". 
11:15  marcuslind: or does the cache clear auto after like 10min or so?
11:15  soee: marcuslind, why dont u give editors option to clear chache ?
11:15  soee: *cache
11:16  marcuslind: How do I do that? I cant find it in the list when editing the user permissions
11:17  soee: u can add option i user TS
11:17  soee: *in
11:20  soee: marcuslind, go BE user settings
11:20  soee: and open tab Options
11:20  soee: in TS secion paste: options.clearCache.all = 1
11:21  soee: user ewill get option to clear full chache
11:21  marcuslind: soee: OK sweet. but still I would like to know. Do cache clear automaticly after a while?
11:23  mgotta: Q: How can I set a specific field of a extension table to be seen in the list view? I know how to set this for each user through the backend, but is there a way to set this for all users globally?
11:30  saedelaere: hi
11:30  dc: @kevke - you said its only within elements of a custom extension? - can you post a short excerpt from the TS which renders the element?
11:32  kevke: I could pastebin the whole thing from scratch, since I dunno how the content is rendered (the ext. is not mine)
11:35  dc: @kevke, ok, do that ;)
11:40  kevke: This is how it has rendered the content into: http://pastebin.com/zEkgkfXK This was clear text before
11:42  randomresult: hi there 
11:42  escapedcat: hi
11:42  kevke: aerrr... it used to be a green line
11:47  saedelaere: our server randomly crashes. swap rans out of space.
11:48  saedelaere: we have this kind of errors in the log
11:48  saedelaere: http://pastebin.com/FAkcWaxd
11:48  saedelaere: could this be related?
11:48  saedelaere: or what does this error mean
11:48  saedelaere: ?
11:53  saedelaere: line 6008 in the mentioned file in the error log looks like this:
11:53  saedelaere: if (file_exists(rawurldecode($splitLinkParam[0])) || $isLocalFile)	{
11:55  JPT: open_basedir is a php setting which restricts the access to folders outside of your directory tree
11:55  JPT: you can disable or alter it in the php.ini
11:56  JPT: OR you can try to find the code that calls file_exists() on "../" and alter it
11:56  JPT: it might be in $splitLinkParam[0]
11:59  mgotta: Q: Is there an issue with label_alt and label_alt_force
11:59  mgotta: ?
11:59  saedelaere: this is line 6007: $splitLinkParam = explode('?', $link_param);
12:03  saedelaere: I'm no php expert. but is this a serious error? I mean we see this error quite often. 
12:04  dc: @kevke - i meant te typoscript setup of the extension, or the part where the extension renders the content element, not the CE itself..
12:05  kevke: oki
12:15  kevke: where do I find this @dc
12:15  kevke: is it either in the backend, or is it in the extension folder?
12:17  soee: ahta are you looking for ?
12:34  kotelette: I got a question about using links in textfields in a frontendplugin
12:34  kotelette: If I type something like '<a href="http://www.google.de">TestLink</a>' in the frontend all HTML chars get escaped
12:34  kotelette: Is there any way to prevent this?
12:37  kevke: @dc and all others: http://pastebin.com/v6PVpVVi
13:07  kevke: anyone an idea about this?
13:17  kraftb: hello !
13:17  kraftb: I have a question regarding powermail ...
13:17  kraftb: I use the "date2cal" extension to show a datetime field in the FE. in a powermail form.
13:18  kraftb: It works fine when I choose a value from the calendar.
13:18  kraftb: but when I type in some (invalid) value, and leave the input box, it does not get corrected to a valid date/time like in the TYPO3 BE.
13:22  kraftb: is there some solution for this?
13:22  dc: @kevke - sorry about the late response - i was having lunch ^^
13:22  kevke: np
13:22  dc: @kevke - you can find the TypoScript Setup under the Module 'Template'
13:22  kevke: yes
13:22  dc: either on the main page or on a subpage (ext: template) should be the setup ts for the extension
13:27  kevke: http://pastebin.com/SZha6gg8 I posted both constants and setup, separated by #
13:32  randomresult: hi there... is there a [global] with which i can see wether a user is logged in in the backend? 
13:32  BenjaminS: [loginUser = *]
13:32  BenjaminS: ah, in the backend
13:32  BenjaminS: :P
13:33  randomresult: jupp backend
13:33  randomresult: i dont know what to search for... 
13:34  kevke: Within your admin block
13:34  kevke: users
13:34  randomresult: [globalVar = TSFE : beUserLogin> 0] 
13:34  randomresult: maybe this... with 1 in the end
13:35  kevke: hoops, read first talk later , excuse me :-)
13:48  ViLco: hello. I've opened "guest_submit.inc" from tt_guest ext, which is also referred in TS by example. I just wanted to understand how could i make something like.
13:49  ViLco: here i found $this object. What it is? Where could i read about it? And is there some kind of documentation about PHP classes, which may be usefull in srcipts?
13:54  dc: @kevke - sorry but after looking through your template i noticed that there is no TS setup for the extension - so the error must be within the .php file you postet earlier... i'm not that great at php though, so i cant really help you out on that one. :(
13:54  kevke: thc anyway
13:55  dc: (unless this wasnt the only template record.. which i dont think is the case, since the other ext setup is also in there)
13:55  dc: but you can see by clicking on the root (earh-ball symbol) using the template module.. then you will see a list of all template recs used throughout the site..
14:28  kevke: So the setup can be either within the ts or the php?
14:33  kggle_: hi. any idea how to reorder the "what is searched for" in indexed_search. it seems to be hardcoded in the sysext or i can edit it in the template? thanks
14:37  kevke: doesn't that google thingy do that ootb?
14:37  kevke: Hello Osna
14:37  snoy_ms: kevke: ?
14:40  kevke: read you are studiing in Osna
14:41  snoy_ms: kevke: yeah :-) (Vorlesung)....zzZZZz
14:41  snoy_ms: hha
14:41  kevke: I know i know
14:41  kevke: topic?
14:41  snoy_ms: C4D
14:41  kevke: that old hat :-)
14:42  snoy_ms: kevke: have to do animation....not my topic
14:42  kevke: but? checking out fields? Have fun.
14:48  kevke: Just out of curiosity: @cd an all: How can something produce a failure in one second and do everything right in another, while the Error in the first second is permanent?
14:51  kevke: permanent=remains
14:51  kevke: unless it is overwritten
14:56  dc: i dont quite get what you mean ^^.. but i've had the same problem before.. it was a js.. and sometimes it worked in IE8, sometimes it didnt... - in the end it turned out that it was a bit-transfer error when the site was moved from one server to the other... o.O
15:06  MarcelT3: hey everybody
15:07  MarcelT3: is there a function that checks for double local links/anchors? i got pages where #6276 appears twice
15:08  MarcelT3: #c6276
15:25  HardPhuck: bah direct mail doesn't have unscubscribe options
15:29  PiMB: it does so
15:32  HardPhuck: not without additional extension
15:46  flipmoe: hi, is it possible to sort records in the be with sortby or default_sortby? extension was created with extbase.
15:53  [mel]: hi there
15:53  [mel]: is there a search extension that provides relevance feedback?
16:02  dc: @me - indexed_search_engine has a relevance info (in percentage) in their default templates.
16:09  [mel]: dc: hows that info generated?
16:15  [mel]: im looking for a user generated ranking here
16:34  mourique: hello everbody
16:37  mourique: i have a question concerning the felogin extension. Is anybody here to help me?
16:41  dc: mel: - ok.. guess thats not supported by that ext...
16:46  [mel]: solr seems to be able to do that
16:47  zed_devil: hi all
16:50  zed_devil: has anybody got the rlmp_language_detection runing with Portugese and Brazil Portugese?
16:50  zed_devil: there ist also a problem with en and en_US
16:58  dc: im out, take care everyone, and i hope t3 todo's go smoothly 4 everyone ;)
17:59  saedelaere: hi
17:59  saedelaere: i have some code than can be added to localconf.php or to a ext_localconf.php
17:59  saedelaere: can i simply create a new directory in typo3conf/ext/
18:00  saedelaere: and inside a ext_localconf.php
18:00  saedelaere: will this file be parsed automatically?
18:01  saedelaere: no, does not seem to work
18:02  saedelaere: so where do I have to put a ext_localconf.php 
18:02  saedelaere: that it will be parsed?
18:09  kaputtmacher: ext_localcon.php should exist within each directory within typo3conf/ext/
18:09  kaputtmacher: example tt_news: typo3conf/ext/tt_news/ext_localconf.php
18:10  kaputtmacher: if you try to adjust the behaviour of an extension
18:10  kaputtmacher: otherwise try typo3conf/ext_localconf.php
18:18  saedelaere: strange, I created a file typo3conf/ext_localconf.php
18:18  saedelaere: with this content
18:19  saedelaere: http://pastebin.com/B4V2kuGS
18:19  saedelaere: when i write the same code in typo3conf/localconf.php it works
18:20  saedelaere: i don't want to have this code in localconf.php
18:22  JPT: put it into ...typo3conf/ext/your_extension/ext_localconf.php and it should be fine
18:22  JPT: maybe you'll need to clear the configuration cache
18:22  JPT: (you should install the extension, too)
18:23  saedelaere: in fact it is not an extension. I just created a new class that returns the real name of the current backend user. so there is nothing to install yet. all I have is the file class.methoden_parserFuncs.php
18:24  saedelaere: and I wanted to let typo3 know of the new function eith an ext_localconf.php and not within localconf.php
18:25  saedelaere: but I will try /typo3conf/ext/your_extension/ext_localconf.php
18:28  saedelaere: no, not working
18:33  Paragon40: Hello Everyone I could really do with some help! I have installed index search plugin and have added to the root of my site but when viewing INFO it show as not indexed?
18:40  saedelaere: so I will have to use localconf.php until I find out how to parse a ext_localconf.php in /typo3conf or any subdirectory
18:52  saedelaere: JPT, kaputtmacher any other suggestions?
18:52  saedelaere: would be nice to have this in a ext_localconf.php
18:54  kaputtmacher: the point is typo3conf/class.methoden_parserFuncs.php:&tx_methoden_parserFuncs->user1 <- looks to me as if you should create an extension via kickstarter and move your tx_methoden_parserFuncs class into it
18:54  kaputtmacher: kickstarter would create an ext_localconf.php file for you
18:54  kaputtmacher: and so on...
18:55  saedelaere: ok than i will read about kickstarter
18:55  saedelaere: s/than/then
18:56  kaputtmacher: create a testextenion and check the folder wehich is created by the kickstarter
18:56  kaputtmacher: within typo3conf/ext/
19:01  Paragon40: Does anyone have any ideas with regards to the indexing question I posted earlier? I have followed the instruction but to no avail?
