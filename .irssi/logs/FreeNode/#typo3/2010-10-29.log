00:34  codeKandis: hey there. having a problem with TS while appending a css depending by site title.
00:38  codeKandis: http://pastie.org/1256735
00:39  codeKandis: i don't know how to glue a string, especially with the title of the site. I know it's not the best solution while the subsites can be the same stylesheet. It's for test and learning only.

08:38  funkytown: Any hints on following? I got a site with multiple languages and one BE user for each language. Now users can't create new content elements in their own language when there's no translation for the default language. Users would need access to the default language to create the element there first and then translate it to their languages. But that's exactly what the customer does *not* want. A 
08:38  funkytown: user of a secondary language should be able to create as many elements as he wants to.

09:35  schu: hello - can anyone point me in the right direction for this problem: i need a TMENU where pairs of two elements  are wrapped in <UL></UL>, but i can't get it to work with allwrap and optionsplit
09:58  aterriblechaos: schu: i would open <ul> and close </ul> with optionSplit, you just need to add a </ul> after generating the menu if register:count_HMENU_MENUOBJ % 2 is not 0
09:59  schu: aterriblechaos: thanks - i tried that but i found a script stub that does exactly what i need (with a few minor modifications) ;)

10:25  tomitzel: Does someone know if there are hooks implemented in DAM, I couldn't find any. I want to make it so that after editing a record when the Save button is pressed to make some changes to the file, any ideas how I could do it without hooks?
10:29  funkytown: foertel: Great, "thanks"!
10:40  foertel: *g*

11:05  egbert_: hi all
11:06  egbert_: I've a question about CoolURI. When I go to the main domain (like www.examle.com, Typo3 doesn't render my page correctly. When I go to www.example.com/home.html, it does
11:06  egbert_: The page that is displayed to me when I go to www.example.com looks like a very old page
11:07  egbert_: However, I've deleted the cache of both CoolURI and Typo3 completely
11:08  foertel: most likely some css pathing is wrong
11:08  foertel: even "looks like a very old page" is not that a detailed problem description :D
11:09  maholtz|WORK: a way better than "does not work" SCNR
11:10  foertel: or "something is wrong"
11:11  maholtz|WORK: yep, i love that detailed descriptions:)
11:11  foertel: the calls i like the most are: "I didn't do anything but it just broke."
11:11  foertel: ya yaa !
11:12  foertel: "And now it does not work anymore … "
11:13  maholtz|WORK: :)
11:13  maholtz|WORK: @egbert: www.example.com/index.php?id=#root pid#&no_cache=1 does that looks better?
11:14  foertel: thank god i'm a a coder and do not have to care for customer calls 
11:14  foertel: *g*
11:19  egbert_: @maholtz|WORK When I go to http://www.up-great.nl/home.html, my page is rendered by Typo3 correctly
11:19  egbert_: When I go to http://www-up-great.nl It is not rendered correctly
11:20  egbert_: http://www.up-great.nl/index.php is also rendered correctly
11:20  maholtz|WORK: @egbert_: ^^ index.php?id=#id of your root page'
11:20  egbert_: It looks like Typo3 doesn't render the canonical root in the richt way
11:20  maholtz|WORK: nope
11:20  foertel: egbert_: both looks good for me
11:21  egbert_: index.php?id=2 in my case is directly translated to http://www.up-great.nl/home.html
11:21  foertel: mh … for me it's both the same
11:21  maholtz|WORK: for me too
11:21  maholtz|WORK: so, everything is fine, clear your browser cache?
11:21  foertel: *g*
11:21  egbert_: The site you're visiting now is a static / non-typo page
11:22  foertel: ah … ok … so you're trying to show us an error by directing us to a static page where the error does not occur?
11:22  foertel: I'm confused ;)
11:22  egbert_: haha
11:22  maholtz|WORK: me too
11:22  egbert_: I've made a copy of the static page on www.up-great.nl on a different server
11:23  maholtz|WORK: and that static page is old and you wonder why it does not get updated?
11:23  egbert_: So in order to see the right page (meaning the one built with Typo3) you add this line to your host file: www.up-great.nl 95.211.9.31
11:23  foertel: erm … no
11:23  foertel: ;-)
11:23  foertel: I'm out … 
11:24  maholtz|WORK: as i said before: me too
11:25  egbert_: Let me rephrase my question: Why is there a difference between www.example.com and www.example.com/index.php?id=2
11:25  foertel: it is not
11:25  maholtz|WORK: perhaps you put an static index.html there?
11:26  maholtz|WORK: or www.example.com is not id=2 but id=whatever
11:26  egbert_: @maholtz|WORK: Oh.... I feel like an idiot.. You were right. I think I shoudn't work on projects until 4 in the morning...
11:26  egbert_: sorry to waste your time
11:27  maholtz|WORK: lol
11:27  maholtz|WORK: nope, you need to get to bet earlier
11:27  foertel: *g*
11:27  maholtz|WORK: or, well at least sleep enough
11:27  maholtz|WORK: btw.: np:)
11:29  egbert_: Thanks again! I'm embarrassed and will now quickly change my name on freenode ;-)
11:30  maholtz|WORK: :)
11:30  egbert_: have a nice day!
11:30  maholtz|WORK: @egbert_ : your welcome:)
11:30  FloLeBlanc: hi all
11:31  FloLeBlanc: happy friday everyone
11:31  maholtz|WORK: @egbert_ : there is a pretty nice book "the pragmatical programmer"
11:33  maholtz|WORK: there is one statement like "the kernel is not wrong". everytime i think something is wrong, which should have been recognized by a thousend others, i know i overlooked something, because "the kernel is usually not wrong" :)
11:34  maholtz|WORK: hello FloLeBlanc
11:36  egbert_: @maholtz|WORK: Yeah... I should read that one...
11:36  maholtz|WORK: gave me some very good pointers
11:38  foertel: maholtz|WORK: you've read getting real?
11:38  maholtz|WORK: nope, sounds i should?
11:38  foertel: don't know me neither … not yet
11:38  foertel: it's written bei 37signals

11:49  FloLeBlanc: hehe
11:51  foertel: maholtz|WORK: trying to become :)
11:51  foertel: "the software developer's career handbook"
11:52  FloLeBlanc: rule 1: take the most stupid concept you can ever think of rule 2: it has to be a concept without any chance of legal revenues rule 3: find someone who sponsors it rule 4: be facebook or youtube :)
11:53  foertel: *g*
11:53  foertel: it's not "the software developer's guide to get rich"
11:53  foertel: :-O
11:53  foertel: :-P
11:53  FloLeBlanc: oh sorry
11:53  FloLeBlanc: got that wrong :)
11:53  maholtz|WORK: lol

20:06  lilalinux: links to moo and meh shouldn't include the linkvar
