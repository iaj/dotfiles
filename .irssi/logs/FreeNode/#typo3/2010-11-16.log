08:56 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 2 seconds
08:56  iaj: any way to speed up a typo site? or is it server based when sites need ages for showing up?
09:00  snoy_ms: iaj: could be the server. Shared Hoster ? Check if you disable cache.
09:00  snoy_ms: iaj: many sites? you use tt_news?
09:01  iaj: snoy_ms: many sites yeah, but no tt_news..
09:01  iaj: many powermail forms can't be causing it, correct?
09:01  snoy_ms: iaj: could be everything.....
09:02  snoy_ms: iaj: typical things are missconf. cache
09:02  snoy_ms: i think
09:03  snoy_ms: iaj: is it a big site?
09:10  iaj: missconf. cache.. how can I check that?
09:11  iaj: snoy_ms: hmm not really I think
09:11  iaj: you could check on http://www.marcgalal.com - its just damn slow sometimes... where typo-editing ain't fun anymore
09:11  snoy_ms: iaj: sometimes people disable cache when bulding the website
09:12  snoy_ms: iaj: slow?
09:12  snoy_ms: ok this page seems to be slow http://www.marcgalal.com/abendseminar_nls.php
09:13  snoy_ms: but the rest is fast (for me)
09:14  iaj: then it is our ISP that makes it seem so slow?
09:14  iaj: thanks for checking... hmm
09:14  iaj: oh.atm its astonishing fast - but that's not the basic behaviour
09:14  iaj: ;-)
09:14  snoy_ms: iaj: ok i see
09:15  snoy_ms: iaj: this page is slow.... http://www.marcgalal.com/current.php
09:15  snoy_ms: ok forum
09:15  iaj: that site ain't used anyhow :)
09:17  snoy_ms: iaj: if you have still problems, check the db querys if you can. needs some console admin
09:18  snoy_ms: have to leave....cu
09:24  iaj: thanks for your efforts
09:31  aterriblechaos: hm somebody knows how to add classes for tables and tds in rtehtmlarea? i tried http://www.pc-erfahrung.de/nebenrubriken/typo3/typo3-css-klassenfrtabelle.html but that did not work
09:40  Denyerek: Mornin all
09:40  Denyerek: chaos: Are you able to add them but they get removed on save?
09:40  Denyerek: or can you not add them at all?
09:40  aterriblechaos: not able to add them, i cant see them at all
09:41  aterriblechaos: i just have my normal paragraph and  character classes, no where my table classes
09:44  aterriblechaos: is there a special place where i can select them or should they appear in character/paragraph settings ?
09:47 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
10:15  Denyerek: I always thought that you could right click and set the properties directly on the table
10:15  Denyerek: taht is, with the default RTE
10:38  aterriblechaos: hm ok, i think this is because i have a outdated RTE .. v. 1.8.12, cant even update the rte ( its a TYPO3 4.3.8 ) .. does somebody know if its save to copy the rte from a 4.4.x ?
10:50  Denyerek: Ouch
10:50  Denyerek: that seems like a can of worms
10:52  sorenmalling: aterriblechaos: Have a look at http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/rtehtmlarea/1.4.4/view/4/4/
10:52  sorenmalling: and look at the setting disableAlignmentFieldsetInTableOperations
11:37  HardPhuck: can i display a list of clickable categories in single view
11:38  HardPhuck: for tt_news
11:39  HardPhuck: if i put in the template ###NEWS_CATEGORY### i get the categories, but those are just listed, not links
11:39  HardPhuck: which i need
11:57  aterriblechaos: ok got it working, thanks for your help .. had disabled block style which is needet for setting table classes *shame on me*
12:08  Denyerek: HP, isn't there a template tag for making something a link in tt_news
12:31  HardPhuck: Den, it is but it just outputs the word not a link
12:41  HardPhuck: Done
12:42  HardPhuck: plugin.tt_news.catTextMode = 2
