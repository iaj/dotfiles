14:21  iaj: hi there
14:21 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 7 seconds
14:24  typomax: soee: BE
14:25  soee: typomax: did u set in localconf to force utf-8 in BE ?
14:25  typomax: yes
14:26  soee: and all texts are without proper signs wven with english version ?
14:26  iaj: i have a little task to achieve i want to create a content element on a page that looks like the following: first it starts with 2 images aligned next to each other with a little space in between, and each of the images got a headline and a little text underneath them (only taking the space of the width of the iamge) and below there should be another text element, but this one should take the whole space there is
14:26  typomax: $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['forceCharset'] = 'utf-8';	//  Modified or inserted by TYPO3 Install Tool.
14:26  iaj: dunno if that's quite understandable :D
14:27  typomax: english is ok
14:27  typomax: chinese arabic russian are wrong
14:28  typomax: before the update everything was working fine
14:29  iaj: http://www.marcgalal.com/task.gif  that's what Im trying to get on my website - how would you guys accomplish this?
14:31  soee: typomax: what update ?
14:32  soee: iaj in those 2 columns you have simple text+image or is it news or something ?
14:32  HardPhuck: iaj: HTML, CSS and FCE :)
14:33  iaj: soee: simple text + image
14:33  typomax: typo3 4.3.2 to 4.4.6
14:33  iaj: HardPhuck: FCE?  i heard about that.. but this one needs TEMPLAVOILA.. doesn't it?
14:33  soee: iaj: than read what HardPhuck wrote
14:33  Millie: hello everybody
14:33  HardPhuck: yes
14:33  iaj: I don't have any clue about templavoila
14:33  iaj: :-(
14:34  HardPhuck: you better start learning then :)
14:34  soee: iaj: start using it
14:34  Millie: it would be nice if somebody here would like to help me..?
14:34  soee: :D
14:34  Millie: can I ask you a question?
14:34  aterriblechaos: iaj: for such a simple task i would use kb_nescefe
14:36  soee: Millie: hehe remember: dont ask to ask just ask -.o
14:36  Millie: is it possible to create an url like www.millie.com/test without realurl? I mean to define your own url and then link to a typo3 site?
14:37  Millie: we have problems with real url but like to send a link to somebody that looks better then the long standard link
14:37  Millie: can you understand my question?
14:39  HardPhuck: Millie: yes with apache mod_rewrite
14:39  soee: i think you can do this using  htaccess
14:39  soee: yes mod_rewrite
14:47  iaj: aterriblechaos: gonna try nwo :)
14:47  iaj: HardPhuck: is there any good manual for getting the hang of templatevoila and FCE?
14:47  Millie: aha ok thanks
14:47  sibbit: Hello, I've set up my typo3 on my apache, everything went smooth but when I log in to backend it redirects me to blank page and apache log reads error 500
14:49  HardPhuck: iaj yes: https://www.packtpub.com/typo3-create-and-modify-templates-with-typoscript-and-templavoila/book
14:49  MateMK4: typomax: do you force utf-8 in php.ini
14:50  typomax: yesssss
14:55  typomax: MateMK4: do you mean deafult_charset = "utf-8" ?
14:56  sibbit: any clues why i get empty page on backend when i log in?
14:57  typomax: .......... and with version 4.4.5 and 4.4.6  the BE using IE is very slow............
14:59  freejoy: HardPhuck: the gallery you showed me yesterday doesn't seem to work with ie8
14:59  HardPhuck: really?
15:00  freejoy: yup, both in my and my friends computer, the thumbnails just loaded forever
15:00  sibbit: buh... got it working... Had to change configuration to display all errors and then got clue how to fix it :)
15:00  freejoy: worked well with chrome, tho
15:00  MateMK4: typomax: yes
15:01  freejoy: and i tried ie8 32 and 64bit
15:01  iaj: aterriblechaos: hmm, i should be able to select that NESTED thing, from the TYPE configuration once I just added it to my extensions
15:01  iaj: successfully
15:01  HardPhuck: freejoy: thanx, must be javscript loader then
15:02  freejoy: HardPhuck: np. actually, the extension I'm looking for should look in the end somethink like this: http://oat.ee/rannapaargu3/
15:02  iaj: aterriblechaos: nevermind, i had to switch to (PAGE VIEW)
15:04  HardPhuck: freejoy could be done with jQeury
15:04  typomax: MateMK4 if I edit the BE content and save the result is fine
15:05  typomax: MateMK4  it seems that has been changed the way to read the data from db
15:05  freejoy: HardPhuck: jQuery?
15:05  freejoy: that same gallery you showed?
15:05  MateMK4: typomax: in that case... I have no experience :(
15:06  HardPhuck: free joy most galleries can have html templates modified
15:06  cervera: hello everyone
15:06  typomax: well thank you up to now   :-)
15:06  HardPhuck: it's presentational thing, has nothing to do with TYPO3
15:06  MateMK4: you should probaly go through the database and correct it... somehow
15:06  cervera: anyone knows how towork with datamints user registration plugin?
15:07  freejoy: at least 2 years ago) pagebrowser seperated from gallery itself and pagebrowser customization was.. limited :/
15:08  cervera: its a real beautiful plugin but its not clear ho to create country selector fields
15:08  HardPhuck: freejoy: do you want your solution to be dynamic (list pages on the same url) or static so when you cliick next you get to a new page
15:09  m4rtijn: hi
15:09  freejoy: hardphuck: i was saying that i am aware of html templating but at least 2 years ago most extensions didn't let to customize the pagebrowser part as much
15:09  freejoy: HardPhuck: dynamic would look nicer, but static works too
15:10  HardPhuck: freejoy, doesn't really matter because you can always get away with css absolute positioning
15:10  freejoy: hmm
15:15  HardPhuck: so pretty much any gallery with prev/next links (and an element with id or class around them) should do
15:15  HardPhuck: i use chgallery because it allows customers to upload folders of images and works out of the box
15:21  m4rtijn: if a data field from a plugin is type stdWrap.. i should be able to set it like this.. 
15:21  m4rtijn: plugin.tx_chgallery_pi1.gallery {
15:21  m4rtijn:   description = TEXT
15:21  m4rtijn:   description.value = bla
15:21  m4rtijn: }
15:21  freejoy: hmm, i think i've used chgallery in the past.. at least the name sounds familiar :P
15:22  m4rtijn: it rocks..
15:22  m4rtijn: just need some custom description though..
15:24  No5251: hi. i'm struggling with RTE ... got 4 in one templavoila template and need to remove the p-tag in only one of them. any hint?
15:24  m4rtijn: HardPhuck: ?
15:25  HardPhuck: yes?
15:25  m4rtijn: should me code work?
15:25  m4rtijn: my*
15:25  HardPhuck: no
15:28  m4rtijn: HardPhuck: but plugin.tx_chgallery_pi1.gallery.description = bla doesnt work either..
15:29  HardPhuck: m4rtijn: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/chgallery/2.5.2/view/1/4/
15:29  m4rtijn: yes
15:29  HardPhuck: here is a list of options that can come into plugin.tx_chgallery_pi1. array
15:30  m4rtijn: HardPhuck: i know
15:30  m4rtijn: description is one of them
15:30  m4rtijn: and its of type stdwrap
15:31  HardPhuck: yes, but that is how the description is presented not the description itself
15:31  m4rtijn: I need to add longdesc="somestuff" ..
15:32  m4rtijn: so I though adding it to the description would do the job.. butI cant even get 'bla' in there..
15:32  HardPhuck: descriptions in chgallery come in a info.txt file located in the same dir as images
15:33  m4rtijn: ah, thats whats meant there..
15:33  HardPhuck: you don't edit descriptions in typoscript templates
15:34  m4rtijn: i just need to get this generated::   <img src="lll"   longdesc="bla">...</img>
15:34  m4rtijn: would you know how to get the longdesc inserted there via typoscript?
15:37  HardPhuck: probably yes
15:38  HardPhuck: but not at the moment i'm @ work
15:38  m4rtijn: k
15:39  smeringe: is it safe to truncate Tx_Realurl_uniqalias right off? I got one wich exploded (almost litteraly) to >22 million rowrs..
15:40  HardPhuck: smeringe: backup the DB and try :)
15:40  HardPhuck: normally it should be fine because most data in realurl tables is just cache
15:40  smeringe: yeah. my thought
15:40  smeringe: HardPhuck: he. thnx.. :) I tried to backup it via phpmyadmin. it timed out.. 
15:40  smeringe: I'll contact the server admins for safety
15:45  smeringe: It was safe truncating it. *puh*. :P
15:48  HardPhuck: :)
15:48  m4rtijn: HardPhuck: got it.. 
15:48  m4rtijn: plugin.tx_chgallery_pi1.gallery.image.longdescURL.data = TSFE:lastImageInfo|origFile
15:55  typomax: anybody has the new typo3 version ?    (4.4.5 or more)
16:12  snoy_ms: typomax: please just ask your question....
16:13  snoy_ms: typomax: just ask, and if its important add the typo3 version

16:33  ivaldi: hm, how to display a text from rte in extbase/fluid ? {foo.bar} -> the content is html-encoded (htmlspecialchars()) ?
16:34  snoy_ms: iaj: 
16:34  snoy_ms: 
16:34  snoy_ms: ups
16:34  snoy_ms: ivaldi: use the viewhelper
16:36  snoy_ms: ivaldi: for example you use fluid as template engine in typo3 directly (typo3 4.5) its the same. Just use <f:format.html>{myContent}<f:format.html>
16:37  snoy_ms: ivaldi: i hope this fix your problem
16:37  cervera: hello everyone..
16:37  ivaldi: works fine - thanl you snoy_ms 
16:37  ivaldi: -l+k
16:48  Trilobite_: hi all, ... picking up where I left last friday.... is it possible to write image files received via a webservice into typo3  in an extension so that it handles them as usual (with caching and hashed filename etc)? Thought I'd try my luck again today, since I'm still rather clueless as how to accomplish that... 
16:50  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: ohh, still searching? Its quit difficult i think. I just found this for webservices http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-extbase_webservices
16:51  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: and the last thing i know was to use an action controller with own view as image recource for an image viewhelper
16:51  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: sounds really crazy but i think this can work..
16:53  Trilobite_: snoy_ms: thanks- i think i'll give it a try... i'll look into writing the view helper, got a really nice book on my desk :-)
16:57  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: You take a controller, build your own view (without templates). This view gives you an encoded image back. Just assign this image to the imageviehelper.
16:57  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: maybe this works. Don't know...just an idea
17:00  Trilobite_: snoy_ms: you mean just an action with no corresponding view?
17:01  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: yes
17:01  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: write your own view (the picture output)
17:03  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: example for an own view -> http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-socialplugins/repository/show/trunk/Classes
17:03  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: i mean http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-socialplugins/repository/show/trunk/Classes/View/LikeButton
17:06  snoy_ms: Trilobite_: extbase checks for a template file. If it doesn't exist it checks for a view Class
17:08  DNukem: Hello typo3 junkies, i thought there was an coding guideline to the naming of class attributes of <div>'s and other elements, if i create html or templates within my own extension.
17:08  DNukem: I cant find anything, someone can provide right keywords or link?
17:23  naag: snoy_ms: i figured out what the problem with http://pastie.org/1445009 was
17:24  naag: snoy_ms: @param integer $quantity causes a parameter type validation to run, even if @dontvalidate $quantity is set
17:24  naag: snoy_ms: this runs filter_var() with FILTER_VALIDATE_INT which doesn't accept null or empty string
17:25  naag: snoy_ms: so @dontvalidate only turns off model validation and @validate directives, but not @param type checks
17:26  naag: snoy_ms: so now i've set the type to string, which works ;-(
17:33  snoy_ms: naag: ohh the type checks....yes
17:34  naag: snoy_ms: sebastian just told me that i should set it to mixed ;-)
17:35  snoy_ms: naag: now i remeber some old mailinglist entrys about that. ahhhrrg
17:35  naag: snoy_ms: funny, i had the same feeling ;-)
17:39  iaj: hm is it possible to, somehow, enable to add <hr/> tags to a CE via the RTE?

17:57  iaj: ok seems like I got it.. its RTE.default.showbuttons.. .but how can I just add a single item to the list?  tried ...showbuttons := addToList(line)  but that's not working:(
18:21  MateMK4: iaj: AFAIK it is possible
18:21  MateMK4: I've been reading some articles on this subject a few days ago, it's a task I'll need to do tomorrow
18:23  MateMK4: try these:
18:23  MateMK4: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/rtehtmlarea/1.4.4/view/5/1/
18:26  MateMK4: http://www.van-tomas.de/blog/how-to-enable-custom-tags-in-typo3-rte/index.html this is on adding tags

18:28  MateMK4: http://www.andre-spannig.com/2010/12/typo3-custom-css-styling-and-classes-in-rte-htmlarea/
18:28  MateMK4: I'll save these for later for myself :)
18:36  Trilobite_: can I pass parameters to controller->action options in the switchableControllerActions select in an extension's configuration flexform?
18:39  iaj: MateMK4: thanks :)
18:40  MateMK4: iaj: If those are of any help, post back what you've used, or paste it somewhere and let me know :)
18:52  Andycas: what would be appropiate way to give write permissions to some directorys for typo3 backend? chmod 775 and chown http?
18:53  Andycas: or is that considered shit/unsecure
18:58  iaj: hmmmm how can I fix the ruler before thing - I tried it but it doesn't want to work :(
19:13  soee: what was the difference between tmp. and lib. ?
19:22  iaj: its adding csc-frame-rulerBefore but it doesn't actually use the <hr /> tag
19:25  HardPhuck: soee http://www.typo3forum.net/forum/typo3-4-x-fragen-probleme/31592-lib-temp.html
19:39  soee: by default i have header from 1-5, hidden etc, how can i add my own, graphical header to the list ?
19:40  pgampe: Andycas: depends on your server config
19:40  Andycas: its better than chmod 777 i presume :)
19:41  pgampe: Andycas: yes ... best would be 700 or even less
19:41  pgampe: Andycas: on a good setup, you can set the owner to the user the webserver runs and just do 700
19:42  Andycas: great :)
19:44  pgampe: Andycas: text/pictures 640, .htaccess 640, perl/php 600, folders 710 is a good try
19:44  Andycas: thanks, I'll remember these

21:30  snoy_ms: Andycas: sorry some homework
21:31  Andycas: snoy_ms, np
21:31  snoy_ms: Andycas: so, here iam :-)
21:32  Andycas: snoy_ms, to be honest this typoscript seems a little daunting at first.. But I am required to use this cms so I intend to keep working on it. So far I know basics about the backend
21:33  snoy_ms: Andycas: You can use the normal/basic way to add templates via typoscript.
21:33  snoy_ms: Andycas: and there are some extensions for mapping
21:34  snoy_ms: Andycas: the big difference is..
21:35  snoy_ms: Andycas: With some of them you have to add markers like ###my_marker### within the html template, so that typo3 can replace them.
21:36  Andycas: Hmm, okay. many cmses use these meta tags to identify where to put content / different elements
21:36  snoy_ms: Andycas: some of them uses id's and classes. like <div id="hereitgoes">...</div> to add/map content
21:37  snoy_ms: Andycas: and the newest one for example is templavoila. It uses the DOM.
21:37  Andycas: I've been using cmses like modx and joomla - in there I could create template and have it up and running in 5 minutes. But its 2nd day for me in typo3 and I still have no clear starting point :P
21:37  Andycas: is this guide outdated? http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_templselect/0.1.0/view/1/3/
21:39  snoy_ms: Andycas: don't be afraid of the templating. In the end you have much more possibilities and i think you will 'love them'
21:40  Andycas: lets hope so :)
21:41  snoy_ms: Whats would you prefere? You add some markers to you template and link them via typoscript. Or do you want to use just the html file and map via mous
21:42  Andycas: mapping by hand ofcourse
21:43  Andycas: by that I mean, adding markers :)
21:44  snoy_ms: I would prefere mapping without markes. Because you don't have to touch your template
21:45  snoy_ms: you can build up your template and just map the div where the content goes, or were the menu has to go
21:46  snoy_ms: Your sure to go the ###marker### way ?
21:47  snoy_ms: Andycas: i just want to be sure that you get the difference at the beginning.
21:48  Andycas: snoy_ms, yes, I think I will prefer marker way because I will have full control
21:49  snoy_ms: Andycas: ahh ok, you have exactly the same control! And the same possibilities!
21:49  Andycas: Ok, then I'll take whatever is easier and faster to do :)
21:51  snoy_ms: Andycas: do you have any typo3 book ?
21:51  Andycas: snoy_ms, nope
21:53  snoy_ms: Andycas: i don't want to discourage you to use something special. But maybe you have to good choises.
21:54  snoy_ms: Andycas: you use "Templa Voila" or  "Template Auto-parser"
21:56  snoy_ms: Andycas: both are popular. I would prefere "Templa Voila", but thats your choice
21:57  Andycas: snoy_ms, I knew about templa voila before but it didn't seem to make my life any easier... I'm still in search of a good documentation for tvoila
21:59  snoy_ms: Andycas: there are alot of good tutorials out there
22:00  snoy_ms: Andycas: german ?
22:00  Andycas: snoy_ms, english only, sorry
22:00  snoy_ms: Andycas: no problem, had some german tut here
22:01  snoy_ms: Andycas: but the first thing you have to do is. Install the newest typo3 version and the newest templavoila extension
22:01  Andycas: Done :)
22:01  Andycas: I have them seperate actually
22:01  snoy_ms: go to fileadmin and check if you have the "templates" folder
22:02  Andycas: I installed templavoila pack from busy noggin
22:02  snoy_ms: Whats busy noggin ?
22:02  Andycas: http://templavoila.busynoggin.com/
22:03  Andycas: prebuilt typo3+templavoila
22:04  snoy_ms: ahh, ok. It brings you a complete example template
22:04  snoy_ms: ?
22:04  Andycas: yes
22:07  snoy_ms: Andycas: the problem with this is, you get alot of new stuff with one installation. 
22:07  snoy_ms: I think its better to do a small simple hello world with templavoila is much easier
22:08  snoy_ms: Andycas: just to understand how it works. Later on you can handel it maybe with such a framework
22:09  Andycas: hmm
22:10  snoy_ms: Andycas: believe me. Its realy simple to use templavoila
22:11  snoy_ms: You should really do a simple "hello world". Then you get how it works
22:11  HardPhuck: Andycas: or buy the book
22:11  HardPhuck: https://www.packtpub.com/typo3-create-and-modify-templates-with-typoscript-and-templavoila/book
22:12  HardPhuck: and you'll learn TemplaVoila in a few days
22:12  Andycas: yeah I stumbled upon that book already
22:14  HardPhuck: well, you can't miss with it, i've read it last week (after working with TV for about two years now) and there was still new stuff to learn
22:44  soee: is there any extensions that extends tt_nows with option to mark some news and than display only those marked ?
22:45  MateMK4: Andycas: may I present you my way into typo3: first installing it with reading some guides....
22:45  MateMK4: well... I just had a nice reply prepared here :P
22:45  MateMK4: anyhow... for the typo3 alone, I've gone through http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_templselect/0.1.0/view/ and http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_ftb1/1.0.1/view/toc/0/
22:56  HardPhuck: soee: yes, it's called categories
22:57  HardPhuck: and they are built in so you don't need additional extensions
22:58  soee: well yes it can be done that way, but it would be much easier for my client to just check some box like "news on front" :) 
22:58  HardPhuck: well make a category named 'star' and he only has to click on it
23:01  HardPhuck: i usually make a video for the not-so-smart clients :)
23:04  HardPhuck: anyway bedtime 4 me... night
