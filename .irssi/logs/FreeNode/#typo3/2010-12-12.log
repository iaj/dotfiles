14:49  iaj: lo there... I'm on a hetzner site and got www.domain.com to work - I added a 'root' of the type starting point there - and made it visible... but nothing is shown when I open the page (still the stuff - site is coming up which is standard by the webhoster) shouldn't there be some errors at least
14:51  iaj: ../typo3 to work it should say after the hetzner part.
15:05  iaj: ahh alright- i had to kill the index.htm from the server or type index.php - clever{

18:06  Cyroq: I'm having problmens with RTE. I can't get the text centered with the RTE tool, and when I manually type <p align="center"> Typo3 doesn't save it. Using <h2 align="center"> does work, strangely enough.

20:26  Cyroq: Well, I do see it appear in the source but the alignment is still standard to the left
20:29  Cyroq: Could it be a problem with css configuration in typo3?
20:30  soee: Cyroq: because you have to include default TRE css or copy it content into your primary css file
20:30  soee: *RTE
20:30  soee: *its
20:31  Cyroq: Ah ok, where can I find the default css?
20:31  soee: i might be wrong, have no time to chek it now, but you can find it here: typo3/sysext/rtehtmlarea/res/contentcss/default.css
20:32  Cyroq: Ok thanks! I'll try to include it
20:35  Cyroq: Amazing, it works!
20:36  Cyroq: Thanks alot
