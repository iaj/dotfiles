08:40  pharno: morning
08:53  maholtz|WORK: morning
08:59  soee: any idea why <br/> tag is inside paragraph when my content is rendered?
09:02  HardPhuck: in content added with RTE?
09:05  pharno: soee: why should it not be?
09:07  soee: pharno, because if i have header than new line and paragraph, the <br> inside paragraph makes extra space between geader and paragraph with text
09:10  soee: just to be cleat my paragraphs got margin bottom 10px by default and so do headers (15px if im correct)
09:10  soee: so 15+10  =25 px space :/
09:27  soee: brb
09:51  pharno: well, I know I asked this on friday, but why is my whole page apearing twice?
10:11  HardPhuck: twice? as in source?
10:12  pharno: HardPhuck: http://pharno.web11.wmc.ch/index.php
10:13  HardPhuck: templavoila?
10:13  pharno: yep
10:14  pharno: y?
10:14  HardPhuck: hmm
10:14  pharno: do you need my setup?
10:15  HardPhuck: sure
10:15  HardPhuck: maybe you have duplicate calls to userFunc
10:15  HardPhuck: not sure though
10:15  pharno: hm
10:15  pharno: its written one time in there
10:16  pharno: http://nopaste.info/915de68e0f.html
10:16  HardPhuck: move bottom three lines to the top
10:17  pharno: well, I took them completly out, and it works
10:17  pharno: still move up?
10:18  HardPhuck: yes
10:19  pharno: well, its apearing twice again
10:19  pharno: Ive includeded templavoila in "include statics from template"(or somethin)
10:20  HardPhuck: then yeah, remove it
10:20  HardPhuck: if it works then it's okay
10:20  pharno: remove which?
10:20  pharno: in setup?
10:20  HardPhuck: yes
10:20  HardPhuck: those that you took out before
10:20  danielawaranie: @lolli: are you here?
10:20  pharno: good, thanks :)

10:22  HardPhuck: always http://pastie.org/1331890
10:22  HardPhuck: those lines should be the first in your TS project when using TV
10:22  HardPhuck: always
10:22 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
10:23  pharno: but only if you dont include templavoila in "include statics"

10:39  aterriblechaos: good morning #typo3
10:41  pharno: morning
10:49  danielawaranie: ups my irc client went offline
10:49  danielawaranie: if somebode respond to me: please repeat
10:51  pharno: noone did...
10:53  HardPhuck: pharno where did you find templavoila in 'include static'
10:54  pharno: db_ttv
10:54  HardPhuck: ?
10:54  HardPhuck: where is that
10:56  pharno: template -> root template -> edit whole template record -> includes -> Include static (from extensions): templates for templavoila
10:59  HardPhuck: strange, i never had that
10:59  HardPhuck: must be your TV installation
11:09  HardPhuck: crap if i add tt_news list to my homepage and newscalendar, the list becomes empty when i browse through calendar
11:09  HardPhuck: ?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=0&tx_ttnews[month]=12&tx_ttnews[year]=2010
11:09  HardPhuck: this gets in the URL and i think the plugin is reading it although it shouldnt
11:10  danielawaranie: lt_basetag was removed from extension repository, can someone provide me a download link (for my study, ignoring the security risk)
11:19  HardPhuck: nvm i switched from list to latest
11:42  saedelaere: hi
11:42  pharno: morning
11:43  saedelaere: can anyone tell me in which table typo3 stores file links? i imported some pages, but the linked files have to go to a different place in fileadmin 
11:43  saedelaere: changing in the database might be easier than doing this for each link manually
11:44  saedelaere: but there are so many tables :Z
11:45  pharno: I guess in the content table
11:46  pharno: there should be a field for the flexform settings
11:47  saedelaere: flexform settings?
11:51  teppi|work: saedelaere, pages
11:51  escapedcat: hi
11:52  teppi|work: but if you use dam it mitght be more complicated
11:52  saedelaere: dam?
11:52  saedelaere: hui, sounds complicated
12:03  soee: hmm, how can configure login box not to redirect user anywhere after login (stay on the same page)
12:07  dannN: Hi, is there an extension, which is sharing a new added tt_news to twitter and facebook ?
12:19  soee: can somebody tell me what does this mean: Gültig bis
12:19  e_: valid until
12:20  soee: e_, thank you
12:22  e_: yw
12:23  soee: e_, Kartenprüfnummer is this a card code ?
12:27  dannN: soee: yes
12:27  dannN: kartenprüfnummer = validation code
12:27  soee: dannN, ok thank you
12:27  dannN: you're welcome
12:51  Paragon40: Hello All... How does one remove a copied skin from typo3 when using the Quicksite framework?
12:54  pharno: anyone an idea why accordionmenu spews many css errors?
12:55  pharno: ... because it adds ";height;height;height;height" to every div, that hasnt already a style=""...
13:12  Paragon40: Ive worked it out... :-)
13:19  HardPhuck: hmm my indexed search is not indexing anything ...
13:19  HardPhuck: always empty results
13:20  MateMK4: hi :)
13:22  maholtz|WORK: @HardPhuck: perhaps there is an extension which disables the whole cache
13:22  MateMK4: is it possible to change the element preset of the element in the datastructure with templavoila, after the element has been made and mapped
13:23  HardPhuck: hmm i'll check it out
13:23  MateMK4: maholtz|WORK, HardPhuck:[SYS][useCachingFramework] = 0 maybe?
13:23  HardPhuck: it's a huge page so it'll take time
13:23  HardPhuck: this is TYPO3 4.2
13:24  MateMK4: just an idea.. since I know, that the parameter exists :P
13:24  MateMK4: oh... not there in 4.3?
13:24  MateMK4: 4.2*
13:24  HardPhuck: useCachingFramework wasn't available in 4.2 AFAIL
13:24  HardPhuck: AFAIK that is :)
13:24  MateMK4: didn't know that
13:25  MateMK4: so since it is used in new versions, it causes problems to newbies like me :)
13:28  MateMK4: anyone masters templavoila here? :)
13:30  maholtz|WORK: @MateMK4: should not have an effect
13:30  PiMB: does anybody really do?
13:33  HardPhuck: maholtz|WORK: just found the indexing tables are full of stuff but i get no results back so i guess it's something with output
13:40  Paragon40: Would some please be kind enough to tell me how I can change the SiteLogo within the typo3 Quicksite framework. I can see a file called skin_constants that has siteLogo = {$templavoila_framework.skinPath}css/images/masthead_title.gif but I am unable to see were this can be changed from within the backend! The Quicksite documentation mentions to change it in template / site constants but I am...
13:40  Paragon40: ...unable to see anything that pertains to the above!
13:41  maholtz|WORK: @Paragon40: where did you get that quicksite framework?
13:41  maholtz|WORK: well, where would i get :)
13:42  Paragon40: maholtz|WORK: http://templavoila.busynoggin.com/
13:44  maholtz|WORK: @Paragon40: you should be able to change it, if you use the Template-Modul
13:44  maholtz|WORK: there is an TypoScript Object Browser, where you can see what is set
13:45  maholtz|WORK: go to the page where your main template is defined
13:45  maholtz|WORK: and change the constants - in the tree, click on them
13:47  Paragon40: maholtz|WORK: Thanks Buddy Ive found it under header / IMG_RESOURCE/file  :-)
13:49  HardPhuck: how do i find the page by it's ID in a HUGE page tree
13:51  maholtz|WORK: @HardPhuck: there is a search in the top right
13:51  maholtz|WORK: pages:123
13:51  maholtz|WORK: tt_content:1234
13:51  maholtz|WORK: should work
13:51  maholtz|WORK: or just the id
13:51  HardPhuck: thanx
13:56  pharno: im having some troubles with typoscript
13:56  pharno: I have a TMENU, and I want the submenus other wraped, than the main menu
13:57  pharno: http://nopaste.info/d749bf19b2.html
13:59  aterriblechaos: pharno: set 2.wrap ..  sample at http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/menus/text-menu.html
14:03  pharno: thanks :)
14:19  HardPhuck: when i visit a page it's not indexed ... strange
14:19  HardPhuck: all the configuration seems correct
14:23  maholtz|WORK: @HardPhuck: use an different browser where you are not logged in
14:23  maholtz|WORK: as admin
14:24  maholtz|WORK: if you are logged in as admin, the page is not cached and the indexed_search cannot index that page
14:24  HardPhuck: ah, lemme check
14:44  HardPhuck: how can i delete all indexes
14:47  danielawaranie: How to add stdWrap support to an existing typoscript property?
14:52  aterriblechaos: danielawaranie: for example http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/cool-stuff-typoscript/typoscript-objekte-mit-stdwrap-erweitern.html
14:55  danielawaranie: but this is only a wrapper, means within my userFunc i create other objects... but i want to extend the config.baseURL to be able to accept more than just a string - how to do that?
14:56  danielawaranie: e.g. to use:
14:56  danielawaranie: config.baseURL = USER_INT
14:56  danielawaranie: config.baseURL.userFunc = myclass->myfunction
14:56  danielawaranie: instead of just use it as it is:
14:56  danielawaranie: config.baseURL = http://www.mydomain.com
15:14  danielawaranie: i get timesouts to news.netfielders.de: is there another free newsserver for typo3 "mailing lists" available?
15:17  sorenmalling: lists.typo3.org :)
15:19  danielawaranie: @sorenmalling: but i want to use a newsreader not a mail client - no newsserver available?
15:19  sorenmalling: That is the url for the news reader
15:19  sorenmalling: Just use news:// for protocol
15:19  sorenmalling: news://lists.typo3.org
15:21  danielawaranie: ok, thanks, i did not know that

16:24  dec__: when im changing my compatibility version from 3.8 to 4.4 and i check "show queries" performed, it never shows me the queries... i'd like to see them, any idea?
16:24  aterriblechaos: danielawaranie: http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=7937 .. seems not so simple to change config.baseURL, you need to use a workaround .. you could use config.disableAllHeaderCode = 1 and create all the header code by hand.. or you use typoscript conditions like suggested in the bugtracker
16:31 --- boonkerz__ is now known as boonkerz
16:35  danielawaranie: @terriblechaos: thanks for the link. as stated there the patch is not working (because the base tag should not be cached), 
16:35  danielawaranie: typoscript conditions: sure, one way to do it (but not the best)
16:36  danielawaranie: i do not understand, why Michael Stucki is saying "introducing stdWrap for config.* properties is currently not possible  because of the way how "config" and page-specific config-objects like  "page.config" are merged." - i can not beleve that (the post is now more than 2 years old)
16:42  aterriblechaos: danielawaranie: http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=9212 problem seems to stay, they are not goint to touch the way config.* is processed
16:48  danielawaranie: next try: the external program that creates typo3 domain records should create as external typoscript file (new "typoscript condition list") each time a typo3 domain record is created/modified/deleted - and then clear the cache programmatically, too
16:48  danielawaranie: bad thing
16:49  danielawaranie: but should solve my problem

17:58  MarcRichter: Hi There, could someone please tell me when exactly TYPO3 re-caches a page? I'm currently having the problem that a page becomes re-generated though neither the hash, nor the content in the filed "HTML" is changing.
18:12  teppi|work: MarcRichter, an existing cache-entry of a page will only be regenerated if the cache entry expires (Field: Cache expires) or you manually delete the FE-Cache for this page or the whole pagetree
18:12  teppi|work: of course there are other ways .. but these two are the default options .. I think
18:19  MarcRichter: teppi|work: Thank you
18:43  kaktuspalme: i got a strange problem, I installed direct_mail_subscription in typo3 4.4 i can add it to pages, but i don't see it in the extension manager
18:53  kaktuspalme: I'm searching for a plugin which is something like a contactform but not the same, i have some pages, every page has a product on it, if the user is interested in a product there should be a form where a user can say, I'm interested, does anyone know a plugin
18:53  kaktuspalme: ?
18:54  Paragon40: Hello All! Has anyone else had the following issue? When selecting Text w/image and the position of "in text, left the text behaves as "Besides text"? Any ideas it also occurs for In text right! 
18:55  kaktuspalme: Paragon40: I think that has something to do with css
18:55  kaktuspalme: Paragon40: i would check that first
18:56  Paragon40: I should mention that I am using the Quicksite framework.
18:59  Paragon40: Thanks kaktuspalme ...
