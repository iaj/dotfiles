08:51  iaj: morning dudes :)
08:51  iaj: is ther any way to directly access a certain CE - like an entry of a powermail form which needs to be updated once per week :\ ?
08:52  iaj: id of the page is 2815 - the CE id would be 326
08:57  iaj: and another thing is there some way to extend shortcuts in typo :S?
09:00  _ramo: hi
09:00  iaj: heya
09:06  maholtz|WORK: morning
09:07  aterriblechaos: good morning
09:15  ndee: morning :)
09:16  aterriblechaos: iaj: you could use the "User>Task Center, Actions" (ext key: sys_action , default not installed)
09:19  ndee: if's and typoscript are really a miracle :D
09:20  ndee: can I use the if for all properties?
09:20  iaj: morning:)
09:21  aterriblechaos: ndee: only on stdWrap or type if ..
09:21  ndee: oh ok
09:22  ndee: is there a way to find out, if something has a stdWrap?
09:22  aterriblechaos: yes, tsref :)
09:22  ndee: but it's from the tt_news plugin
09:22  ndee: ah
09:22  iaj: aterriblechaos: in that taskcenter I only got the possibilty to Export Presets..
09:23  iaj: nvm :\ installing
09:24  randomresult: good morning
09:25  aterriblechaos: ndee: so tt_news manual should help!
09:25  ndee: http://pastie.org/1286509 <-- would something like this work? is the syntax correct on the last line?
09:25  randomresult: someone ever worked with workspaces
09:26  aterriblechaos: iaj: just install sys_action and create a new action record on the "world" icon (uid=0)
09:26  aterriblechaos: ndee: Ã¤hm .. no!
09:26  ndee: think I found the problem
09:26  ndee: :D
09:26  ndee: aterriblechaos, I know, I would need a condition too
09:27  ndee: but
09:27  aterriblechaos: ndee: yes, stdWrap.if.value=something stdWrap.if.equals.value=blah or whatever ...
09:29  ndee: ok, so stdWrap.if is kinda like a wrapper? I think I have an idea .D
09:30  ndee: http://pastie.org/1286522 <-- that's what I got so far, now, I want to make if "TRUE", if the plugin.tt_news.code equals "LIST2"
09:31  aterriblechaos: you have to look how to get plugin.tt_news.code an than use the if.value if.euqals example ..
09:31  ndee: ah
09:31  ndee: yeh$
09:31  ndee: I can also try a TS in the plugin itself actually
09:33  ndee: TS in the plugin works like a charm
09:33  ndee: thanks :D
09:41  iaj: aterriblechaos: THANKS So much -that will help me soo much :-)))
09:46  aterriblechaos: np, you are welcome
09:49  maholtz|WORK: @ndee: i do not know what you want to define, but IMHO you can define image dimensions for singel-view, list-view and latest-view seperatly
09:56  ndee: maholtz|WORK, the thing is, I need even more views for tt_news :) but it works now :)
10:00  Guschtel: hi, i have a problem with my google sitemap in typo3. all urls contain the domain twice, i.e. http://www.example.com/typo3/http://www.example.com/typo3/path/to/page.html
10:01  Guschtel: does anyone know what could cause this?
10:02  ndee: Guschtel, to me, it looks like a set base href + absolute links
10:06  koen: Hi all
10:13  randomresult: ok - im working with workspaces... and if i use the 3column preview window... i see no changes... 
10:13  randomresult: what to do?

10:26  raki: good morning!
10:27  koen: Hi, we have a really weird problem with images in a site. They keep disappearing (normal text/images). If you clean the cache the images are back.
10:27  koen: We have tried to change all possible settings, but we have no clue anymore
10:28  koen: Can anybody help me please
10:28  raki: does anybody know why my selected records in a flexform listbox (multi select) are not shown in the backend form? select options are generated by a user function (called via itemsprocfunc)
10:29  ndee: http://pastie.org/1286609 <-- should this TS if work? because it doesn't :/
10:29  ndee: that whole block is in a plugin.tt_news.displayList bracket.
10:29  raki: (but they are stored. I looked them up in the DB.)
10:39  ndee: http://pastie.org/1286630 <-- shouldn't this set the file.maxW, file.width and file.height to different values?
11:04  snoy_ms: koen: don't understand the problem. Are the images disappeard or back ?
11:07  Prot0: koen: did you change anything on the server level, any extensions installed recently. TYPO3 core upgrades?
11:09  randomresult: i hate workspaces 
11:16  maholtz|WORK: @aljoscha: you cant, alias is unique and there is another page with alias "leue"

11:31  maholtz|WORK: @aljoscha: you should not need an alias if you have realurl enabled
11:42  Guschtel: ndee: it seems i'm not able to change this... i have no idea why the sitemap includes the hostname twice. on all other pages all the links are fine
11:45  koen: @Prot0: we have latest version of typo3 (4.4.2) running. No core updates. We didi make our own custom plugin
11:46  aterriblechaos: koen: i would try to trace the problem down ... are the files deleted in typo3temp? is the cache table incomplete? etc
11:47  koen: @maholtzlWORK: Does special typoscript explain why images are disappearing after a period time and that they are back after cache clear?
11:48  koen: @aterriblechaos: No, typo3temp is still filled with all the images. At first we had a rights issue, but that one is solved a long time ago
11:49  aterriblechaos: koen: are the image in the html source still present ?
11:50  aterriblechaos: if yes, try to call them directly with the browser
11:55  maholtz|WORK: @koen: in combination with caching: yes
11:57  HardPhuck: that's strange, i'm trying to update 4.3 to 4.4 and iget blank screen, when i check error logs it seems it's still trying to read from the 4.3 src?
11:57  zed_devil: hi all
11:57  HardPhuck: is there some cache i'm unaware of
11:57  HardPhuck: i've deleted the typo3temp files
11:59  zed_devil: i just tried to set up a workspace in my 4.4.4; everthing ist working but the previe allways shows the same as the "live" mode; i tried the same settings in another web and it works fine, what could be the problem

20:56  kklasing: Hi all
21:01  kklasing: Goodevening all
21:01  PiMB: evening
21:02  kklasing: Hi PiMB
21:02  kklasing: I was wondering if somebody can help me with a reallty weird problem.
21:02  kklasing: in typo3
21:03  kklasing: We have multiple Typo3 sites running and all but one run fine.
21:04  kklasing: The problem we face (and we are banging ourheads against the wall on this one) is that images in normal images or text width images fields are disappearing from the site after a period of time
21:05  kklasing: When we clear the cache the images are back again, but that is not a permanent solution
21:05  kklasing: We are running typo3 4.4.2
21:05  PiMB: :)
21:05  kklasing: Can anyone help me on this one
21:05  PiMB: may I suggest to check how much HD room there is available for the website?
21:05  PiMB: Sounds a bit like a quota exided and the temp's are no longer able to be rendered/stored
21:06  kklasing: Moment
21:06  kklasing: let me check
21:13  kklasing: We have 5GB of disk space available and are now using 499M
21:13  kklasing: should be enough :)
21:13  PiMB: for the specific site right?
21:13  kklasing: yep
21:13  kklasing: this is the space we have at our provider
21:15  PiMB: should be sufficient then ;)
21:15  PiMB: do you have a link?
21:15  PiMB: and the problem ATM?
21:15  kklasing: www.teleforwarding.de
21:15  tokam: hi will the latest typo3 version work with PHP Version 4.4.9? :D 
21:15  PiMB: nope
21:15  jjulian: does anyone know how to get the content of the first subpage with typoscript?
21:15  PiMB: it won't
21:15  tokam: which version is required?

21:22  Guschtel: <div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap csc-textpic-single-image"></div> <- no image
21:22  kklasing: What is strange is that the disk usage is now staying at 499M, so maybe PiMB you are right and it is a storage problem and the quota on the server is not set according to the specs of the contract
21:23  kklasing: @Guschtel, yes that's what I get all the time.
21:23  kklasing: Let me clean the cache now and you should be able to see the images
21:23  kklasing: Hang on
21:24  Guschtel: mmh works
21:24  PiMB: Do images that first appeared suddenly dissappear?
21:24  kklasing: And now you should see the images
21:24 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 147 seconds
21:24  Guschtel: def. a problem with storage in your tmp dir
21:24  Guschtel: is typo3temp a link to some global temp dir?
21:25  Guschtel: that gets cleaned by a cron job or so?
21:25  kklasing: Nope
21:25  kklasing: just a normal dir within the typo3 setup
21:26  kklasing: But my disk usage keeps on beeing 499M
21:26  kklasing: Should that not change when you clean the cache?
21:26  PiMB: could be
21:26  kklasing: Or is that only cleaning the cache tables in the database
21:26  PiMB: could you try to create a file in the fileadmin?
21:27  PiMB: clear cache is only DB
21:27  kklasing: Let me upload a file to the fileadmin
21:29  kklasing: I've just uploaded http://www.teleforwarding.de/fileadmin/A-5728-3 zilver.jpg
21:29  kklasing: Now disk usage is 500M, so that is growing
21:30  Guschtel: hm different question. how do you make one content field span three rows?
21:31  kklasing: @Guschtel, it is not one content field. It are custom tt_content items with typoscript rendering
21:31  kklasing: But the problem is also in normal images as on the page http://www.teleforwarding.de/de/ueber-uns/kernkompetenzen/
21:32  Guschtel: image is there ;)
21:32  kklasing: yep
21:32  PiMB: and the problem dissapears after clearing the cache via the lightning bolt in the top right corner?
21:33  kklasing: Yep
21:34  PiMB: then it's not a size problem
21:34  PiMB: not a HD problem at least
21:34  kklasing: oke
21:34  PiMB: cause clearcache is only DB related
21:34  Guschtel: quota on the db size?
21:35  PiMB: doesn't make sense for it to remove <img /> tags from otherwise normal page :)
21:35  kklasing: Let me see if I can check if there is a quota on the db
21:36  kklasing: There is no mention on the db quota. 
21:36  jjulian: can somebody tell me an a page where i can find something about CONTENT object to get the FIRST subpage of the current page
21:36  kklasing: @PiMB, no it does not make sense at all. 
21:37  PiMB: true that
21:37  kklasing: We where thinking of an ImageMagick problem that the images are destroyed if to many users are requesting them
21:37  PiMB: what you could do is if you find a page without images check what the html is inside the DB
21:37  PiMB: might be a problem in saving cache file or something
21:37  kklasing: Bu in all the scenario's, when we are missing images, the images on the homepage are always there. They don't get lost
21:38  PiMB: damn, gotta run. Or ill miss my 'train
21:38  PiMB: is the homepage 'no_cache' ?
21:38  kklasing: @PiMB, thanks for your help
21:38  PiMB: but is the homepage nocache?
21:39  kklasing: no
21:39  PiMB: well, I think you've got a real mistery on your hands
21:39  kklasing: lol
21:39  PiMB: maybe try scooby doo?
21:39  PiMB: sorry mate, don't know why he does it.
21:40  PiMB: I'll try to think of something.
21:40  kklasing: thnx
21:40  PiMB: I'll be around here usually during the day (9-17h GMT +1)
21:40  PiMB: so if you need help, see you then
21:40  PiMB: later
21:40  kklasing: later
21:49  kklasing: @Guschtel could the cache_period be an issue in this problem
21:50  kklasing: I just found out that I had a config.cache_period of 7200 and a page.config.cache_period of 3600
21:50  Guschtel: try changing it :)
21:50  kklasing: Yes I did
21:51  kklasing: but to you knowladge, could this be a problem?
21:51  Guschtel: no idea
21:51  kklasing: okay
