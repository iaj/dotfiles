21:45  iaj: hi there
21:45  iaj: how can I embedd a favicon to the urlbar.. !?
21:54  Thasmo: iaj, just copy a file called favicon.ico into the web-root of your website.
21:54  Thasmo: douglasb_, you can use this: http://www.phlogi.net/t3/tsp/
21:57  iaj: Thasmo: wheres my webroot?! /fileadmin?
22:00  Thasmo: iaj, no - where the index.php is - that's the root probably.
22:01  iaj: Thasmo: thanks! working )))
22:07  douglasb_: looks like the paste service hung when I submitted it...
22:15  douglasb_: here we go. found a pastebin to use: http://pastebin.ca/1969334
22:17  Thasmo: douglasb_, and the marker ###FILEPATH### is located in fileadmin/pyramis_public/pyramis-news.html?
22:20  douglasb_: one is in pyramis-news.html and it works. the next is in subparts.ACC_CONTACT_SELECTED
22:20  douglasb_: its subparts.ACC_CONTACT_SELECTED that is not parsing
22:20  douglasb_: wondering if it's possible to make that parse or not
22:23  Thasmo: douglasb_, so the file 'acc-contact-us-selected.html' has marks which don't parse? thats what you mean?
22:23  douglasb_: yes
22:25  douglasb_: i don't know if typo3 can parse a file that is being included or if there is different syntax to let it know to parse the marks in the subpart FILE
22:26  Thasmo: douglasb_, then you need to include another TEMPLATE object like this: http://pastebin.ca/1969341
22:28  douglasb_: ah! that is IT exactly. that is too damn cool. works like a charm.
22:28  douglasb_: thasmo++
22:32  Thasmo: np
22:32  Thasmo: :>
22:33  douglasb_: now, i got the first part of the example from a book. is the use of "temp" objects common practice? why not just do page.maintemplate = TEMPLATE rather than the temp.maintemplate = TEMPLATE?
22:33  douglasb_: i'm not seeing the benefit clearly 
22:34  douglasb_: http://pastebin.ca/1969348
22:35  Thasmo: douglasb_, I try to avoid calling them "temp" or "tmp" or "test" or anything similar - but I also use some kind of "global" storage and then assign them wheere I need them.
22:35  Thasmo: douglasb_, didn't I send you my Website-Dummy kit or wasn't that you?
22:38  douglasb_: yes, that was me....I have been fiddling with the little site I had going when you sent me that. i'm going to get that open in the next day or two
22:40  Thasmo: k k
22:55  Thasmo: Does anybody know how to configure my IDE to use Subversion? It's asking for a subversion command line executeable, but I'm not sure where to get that.
23:04  douglasb_: ah, global sound much better than temp. i assume you could create a ts template with globals then include them somehow where and when you need, just like the HTML example you just helped me with
23:07  Thasmo: douglasb_, usually I stick all my stuff inside a global object called "application". FOr example inside "application.template" all my typoscript-generated content is stored and then where I need it I just do e.g. page.marks.CONTENT < application.template.content
23:08  Thasmo: or whatever you need: application.template.header, application.template.footer, application.template.copyright, application.template.mainmenu
23:47  SargoDarya: yo chan :D
