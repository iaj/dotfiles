08:40  iaj: morning guys
08:40  iaj: is there some way to change the order of header and picture in TEXT WITH PICTURE ce ?
08:41  HardPhuck: yes there is
08:42  HardPhuck: ah header,.. sorry no
08:42  HardPhuck: well,.. maybe it could be done but haven't tried it yet
08:45  aputtu: iaj: you can have several elements on a page (for example picture element, then text element)
08:46  iaj: HardPhuck, aputtu thanks... well ill just use a TEXT W/ PIC and don't use the original header then
08:46  iaj: I'm just trying to make the easy as easy to maintain as possible.
08:58  iaj: Hmm, I'm trying to use Firefox 4.0B8 to do typo3 editing, but its crashing a lot.. and rather slow compared to chrome - which browser do you guys use?
09:00 --- Users 57 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 56 normal]
09:03  HardPhuck: Chrome
09:10  sorenmalling: Firefox and Chrome with no crashing issues in either of them
09:19  aputtu: Hi, instead of uploading larger files (~1MB or more) in BE I get a browser dialog asking whether to open/save tce_file.php - but upload is not saved. (Smaller files gives no such problem.)

09:36  MateMK4: Good day! :) (rainy in fact... :p )
09:37  MateMK4: a quick Q: how to add space into TS? e.g. 10 = TEXT  10.value = space.space
09:37  MateMK4: " . " and ' . ' doesn't work
09:37  soee: morning :)
09:37  MateMK4: &nbsp;
09:37  MateMK4: morning :)
09:37  MateMK4: >	a quick Q: how to add space into TS? e.g. 10 = TEXT 10.value = space.space
09:38  soee: MateMK4: as u said: &nbsp;
09:38  MateMK4: soee: then i get &nbsp; on the page
09:39  MateMK4: what I want to do...
09:39  MateMK4: http://hektor.fe.uni-lj.si:81/index.php?id=44
09:39  soee: well than your content is passed trough htmlspecialchars or smth
09:39  MateMK4: at the bottom of the page "Ime Highlighta"
09:40  MateMK4: there are spacers between items %20.%20
09:40  MateMK4: they are elements in FCE in TV
09:40  MateMK4: they are plain text
09:41  MateMK4: because I don't know, how to insert <span> . </span> otherwisež
09:41  soee: MateMK4: check in FCE settings if you have htmlSpecialChars (HSC) option checked
09:42  MateMK4: aahh... 
09:42  MateMK4: this option has to be unchecked
09:43  MateMK4: you were right, i was wrong :D thanks :)
09:44  soee: :)
09:49  MateMK4: there is yet another thing :)
09:50  MateMK4: I have: <div>something</div><div>some more</div>
09:51  MateMK4: I want all this to be a section container, so imap frist div range to second
09:51  MateMK4: but this includes tags
09:51  MateMK4: and I need them
09:52  MateMK4: like: <div>my dinamic elements</div>
10:06  MateMK4: Some more people have joined, I'll repost my question:
10:06  MateMK4: I have: <div>something</div><div>some more</div>
10:06  MateMK4: I want all this to be a section container, so I map frist div range to second
10:06  MateMK4: the problem is, that this kind of mapping includes <div> tags, which should not be replaced.
10:06  MateMK4: I want this to be like: <div>my dinamic elements</div>
10:12  MateMK4: I have "faked" it :)

10:58  ivaldi: snoy_ms , in extbase you can define a object->table mapping per TScode - is it possible to define a mapping of a object property? (database name foo -> object property-name bar)
11:00  MateMK4: I've placed this RTE.default.proc {
11:00  MateMK4:   allowTags (a, b, i, u, sub, sup, ul, li)
11:00  MateMK4: }
11:00  MateMK4: in Root Page TSconfig... but seems to have no effect
11:00  MateMK4: any ideas?
11:08  HardPhuck: yes the version without proc is missing
11:08  HardPhuck: :)
11:09  HardPhuck: google the typo3.net forum for examples

11:23  iaj: hmmm i want csc-header to be margin-topped by 1.2em but only if its not the first element of the page... any way to do that?
11:27  snoy_ms: ivaldi: hey there. I think you should map objects. (but i think you don't need to map all attributes)
11:27  aterriblechaos: iaj: there is csc-firstHeader and csc-header, just set the css rules
11:30  iaj: aterriblechaos: thanks :))
11:31  iaj: may it be its called csc-header-n1 tho?
11:31 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
11:31  iaj: another thing, can I somehow enable to add custom classes to a div?
11:32  iaj: e.g. a simple textelement CE but to add a 'myownclass' to it?
11:36  aterriblechaos: iaj: yes, you could use the layout field for that .. http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/cool-stuff-typoscript/using-the-layout-field-in-tt-content-and-pages.html
11:36  snoy_ms: ivaldi: for example you just want to save the birthday of a person and persist it to tt_address. Then you should add a small Person Model with the Attribute Birthday. You can still map this to tt_adress for example, without adding any other attributes to the model!
11:36  aterriblechaos: csc-header-n1 could it be to, just look at the source luke! ;)
11:36  soee: how can i remove more link at the end of subheader text in tt_news list view ?
11:37  sibbing: hello, im messing around with typoscript... how do I seperate menu from header div in here: http://pastebin.com/GgU1H0Gj

11:37  iaj: aterriblechaos: hmm ok.. so theres no other way.. ihave so many layouts defined already :)
11:38  aterriblechaos: iaj: there is  section_frames too .. but you are right, if you have a lot of layouts it becomes a mess
11:39  soee: thank you aterriblechaos 
11:40 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
11:41  sibbing: can someone help?
11:43  soee: sibbing: what do you mean by separate ?
11:44  sibbing: soee: so that i can have menu div outside header div, seperately
11:44  sibbing: I need to float content next to menu, but I can't do it when it is inside header block
11:44  soee: sibbing: put menu in other lib
11:46  sibbing: soee: I don't understand... I can't even get text to display that is seperately from header, like here (last 3 lines):  http://pastebin.com/u6ugreCf
11:48  soee: sibbing:  10 = TEXT is in some lib ?

11:50  sibbing: soee: Im editing templavoila template btw
11:50  snoy_ms: sibbing: Your using this busy noggin framework ?
11:51  sibbing: snoy_ms: yes
11:52  sibbing: If I want to put something outside COA, what should I do?
11:53  sibbing: It shows up when its inside COA header brackets, but when it is outside it doesn't show up...
11:55  snoy_ms: sibbing: i think the header is mapped in any way to the template file.
11:55  snoy_ms: sibbing: never used that framework
11:57  snoy_ms: sibbing: if you want to add new 'objects', or separate them, you need some mapping within the template. Else Typo3 doesn't know where to place it.
11:58  snoy_ms: sibbing: did you use templavoila without this framework before ?
11:59  sibbing: snoy_ms: no
12:01  snoy_ms: sibbing: its really difficult to help with such alot predefined configs.
12:01 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
12:05  sibbing: snoy_ms: :(
12:06  snoy_ms: sibbing: mhh, what can you do....
12:07  snoy_ms: sibbing: Can't you better use an own template with templavoila ? Without using a framework....
12:08  snoy_ms: sibbing: It seems to be a great framework, but you need to understand how Templavoila <-> Typoscript works.
12:10 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
12:10  snoy_ms: sibbing: I don't think that it helps if i say: "add some new mapping use it like soee says with for example lib.myDiv"

12:17  HardPhuck: what is freshTS?
12:17 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
12:20  ivaldi: sorry, i was in a meeting ;) - snoy_ms , the problem is, there a 2 objects, 1 from pages and one from my own tx_... table
12:20  ivaldi: in pages the cell-name (tx_...._image) differs from the name in the tx-table (image) - but i'd like to use the same getter - (okay - i can add the property tx_..._image + setter and getter and return the other property in the getImage(), but a mapping would be nicer ;)
12:27  snoy_ms: ivaldi: you have to objects. One is mapped from pages (a page object) and one selfmade with its own table ?
12:28  snoy_ms: to = two
12:29  ivaldi: yes
12:29  ivaldi: and both have the same parent-class

12:32  kaputtmacher: hi all
12:32  kaputtmacher: any clue why rtehtmlarea is entityfying my <cite> tags ?!
12:34  ivaldi: it's complicated - to complicated to explain
12:34  ivaldi: easy solution - if its possible to map a database-cell to an other property-name - i will use it, if not - i write a secound getter/setter (but i would prefer the first solution)
12:35  HardPhuck: kaputtmacher: because they are not allowed by default
12:35 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
12:36  kaputtmacher: that's why i modiefied the default setting and extended it to make cite work
12:36  kaputtmacher: but it doesn't
12:36  kaputtmacher: but i found something interesting in the mailinglist
12:42  ivaldi: (i assume that a propetry mapping isn't possible - so i'll use the redundant setter/getter ;)
12:44  snoy_ms: ivaldi: I don't know how you map pages , but you can specify the property name for the tx_blabla_image cell i tink
12:46  kaputtmacher: HardPhuck: solved…
12:46  kaputtmacher: lib.parseFunc.allowTags mistake....
12:47  snoy_ms: ivaldi: maybe i missunderstood the problem, but when you map a page object, you can set the property name for the cell.
12:47  snoy_ms: ivaldi: just check out the snippeds http://typo3.sfroemken.de/typo3-tutorials/extensions/fluid/extbase-framework-konfiguration.html
12:48  snoy_ms: ivaldi: the mapping part where it maps the cells to a property
12:49  ivaldi: thank you - exactly what i wanted - i'll try it
12:49  snoy_ms: ivaldi: but thats not only a property mapping. You still need an Object i think. But it can be an Object with just one Property ;-)
12:50  ivaldi: i just want ro rename the property
12:51  snoy_ms: ivaldi: try it
12:57  ivaldi: hm, doesn't work - nevermind, i write another/move the current getter/setters - thank you snoy_ms

13:31 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
13:32  neoneye: with TYPO3 4.4.2... what should be prototype version be?  I have 1.6.0.3 installed
13:32  neoneye: but the latest is prototype 1.7
13:33  neoneye: or should I try with prototype 1.6.1
13:36  No5251: neoneye: ExtJS
13:36  neoneye: does htmlarea use extjs?
13:37  neoneye: I have found out that defer() isn't working for me for some reason
13:37  neoneye: e.g HTMLArea.initEditor.defer(150, null, [editorNumber]);  doesn't work
13:37  neoneye: but window.setTimeout(function() { HTMLArea.initEditor(editorNumber); }, 150); works
13:38  neoneye: so htmlarea will not init
13:38  neoneye: I wonder if I can upgrade prototype
13:38  neoneye: or extjs.. if thats where the defer() is defined
13:39  No5251: neoneye: did you cleand up your browser cache?

14:23  iaj: surrounded by.... on the FE... I mean
14:25  Axcy: Is it possible to have typo3 give all a image links a specific class?
14:25  Axcy: I'm having a bit of trouble as a costumer wants all links to have a dotted underline, this makes image links also have it :/
14:29  sorenmalling: Axcy: Use css to avoid the decoration img a { SOMETHING }
14:30  HardPhuck: iaj: yes it's possible
14:31  HardPhuck: iaj: open typo3/sysext/css_styled_content/static/setup.txt
14:31  HardPhuck: and look at the line 470
14:32  HardPhuck: to check how css style content wraps the content
14:32  HardPhuck: then override that behaviour in your own TS template
14:32  Axcy: sorenmalling: That's not a solution unfortunately, as the dotted underline is on the a:link and not on the image itself
14:33  Axcy: The problem arises when I've got images which are links, but the a:link has no class
14:33  Axcy: So atm. half the pictures on the site have a dotted line below them :/
14:35  HardPhuck: Axcy: you can add a class to all links even those with images
14:35  HardPhuck: so add a class="noborder" (or something) to all your links with images
14:37  Axcy: HardPhuck: How so?
14:37  HardPhuck: where are those imageS?
14:37  HardPhuck: in content?
14:37  Axcy: Yes, in the content put in via the RTE
14:37  HardPhuck: via RTE?  crap :)
14:38  Axcy: Unfortunately >< 
14:38  Axcy: .csc-textpic-image, .csc-textpic-firstcol, .csc-textpic-imagewrap, .no-link-border a:link{text-decoration:none;border-bottom:none;} <- That really isn't a viable solution :(
14:39  Axcy: So was wondering if there was any way to make all image links have a specific class :/
14:39  Axcy: Cuz atm. some image links have no class, which means they have the dotted border
14:39  iaj: HardPhuck: line 445 is the one for text element isn't it?
14:40  HardPhuck: tt_content.image = COA this line and everything inside
14:40  iaj:  HardPhuck but Im just considering text elements - isn't that one you mention for TEXT + Picture CEs?
14:41  HardPhuck: iaj then yes 445
14:42  Axcy: HardPhuck: Any other good idea's? ;)
14:42  iaj: HardPhuck: ok... mhhh so that's where I need to adjust something... is it hard to surround the body?   tt_content.text.20 that's where I need changes I guess
14:43  HardPhuck: Axcy: yes, I think it can be done with lib.parseFunc
14:43  HardPhuck: or lib.parseFunc_RTE
14:44  HardPhuck: lib.parseFunc_RTE.nonTypoTagStdWrap.encapsLines.addAttributes.IMG.class = noborder
14:44  HardPhuck: try this ^^
14:44  Axcy: Where do I add this? My main TS template?
14:44  HardPhuck: iaj, just don't modify the file, override it in your TS templates
14:44  HardPhuck: Axcy yes
14:45  Axcy: HardPhuck: This wont remove it from existing images will it? 
14:46  iaj: HardPhuck: yeah.. I know.. Im just trying to figure it out :)
14:48  HardPhuck: Axcy hmm wait
14:48  HardPhuck: that won't work
14:48  Axcy: HardPhuck: Doesn't seem to work :( 
14:48  Axcy: Ah ok
14:48  HardPhuck: you need class on the link not image
14:48  Axcy: True
14:49  HardPhuck: then you'll need to check htmlarea docs on how to add classes to anchor
14:49  HardPhuck: and manually add them
14:49  HardPhuck: for those that have images
14:49  Axcy: I just checked, seems the biggest problems are from the Typo3 "Text /w image"
14:49  HardPhuck: or fix it with jQuery :)

16:39  sorenmalling: initCH: inside the <typoscript> part of your datastructure :=)
16:40  snoy_ms: initCH: Or just within the fce element as usual. (Access for Group XY.... ) If that is your approach
16:47  tribunus: hi all- today for something different... (i'm writing my first extbase extension) and was wondering if it is possible to switch tabs in the backend config for the plugin according to the value set in a select box?
16:48  tribunus: my colleague swears he saw this somewhere in an extension, but can't remeber the name
16:48  initCH: sorenmalling, conditions didnt work in typoscript in fce's
16:49  initCH: but this worked if.isTrue.data = TSFE:fe_user|user|username -> sorenmalling
16:49  initCH: but know id like to use "wrap = <span>| asdf</span>" but typo3 crashed cause the < 
16:50  sorenmalling: initCH: Thanks for that information :) 
16:50  initCH: np sorenmalling
16:50  initCH: u know how wrapping html tags is possible?

16:53  sorenmalling: I love learning new stuff :) and help with what I got :)
16:54  cervera: HardPhuck are you there?
16:54  cervera: anyone knows a website where i can copy and paste typoscript code?
16:56  cervera: i mean: i got a TS menu that doesn't work and would like to show it to anyone can help me out..
16:58  snoy_ms: tribunus: Do you mean tabs via TCA ?
16:59  tribunus: snoy_ms: hi there, yes- i have a select already implemented and would like to make further config options accessible through tabs
17:00  snoy_ms: tribunus: This is nothing special about extbase. Its just some TCA magic.
17:01  tribunus: oh ok, i see
17:01  snoy_ms: tribunus: you don't want to build your own backend module, or?
17:03  snoy_ms: tribunus: german, but you can read the snipped http://www.typo3-snippets.de/snippets/extension-programmierung/tca-felder-in-tabs-anordnen.html
17:04  snoy_ms: tribunus: '--div-- ' does the magic for you.

17:09  tribunus: ... but how would i write this in xml, because i have a flexform.xml
17:11  sorenmalling: Anyone working with pageRenderer and Fluid templates? I would like to use addCssFile inside initializeView but can't really find it possible
17:12  snoy_ms: tribunus: http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Extension_Development,_using_Flexforms
17:13  snoy_ms: tribunus: search for tabs / <sheets>
17:15 --- nej_ is now known as nej
17:16  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: what you mean with pageRenderer + fluid ?
17:16  sorenmalling: I would like to use pageRenderer from $GLOBALS['TSFE'] to add a css file from my extension to the final output
17:17  tribunus: snoy_ms: thx- i'll do some reading now... 
17:17  tribunus: :-)
17:18  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: i saw something like this...mhh. Within the controller they get TSFE and include the files....but i could be wrong
17:18  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: I would like to avoid using the setup.txt that I am now :)
17:20  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: i know what you mean....mhh
17:21  sorenmalling: :)
17:22  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: most extensions uses ts header stuff. Maybe i find something...
17:23  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: maybe you get it witin the controller "$this->cObj = $GLOBALS['TSFE']->cObj;"
17:24  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: I can get to the pageRenderer with $GLOBALS['TSFE']->getPageRenderer() - but if I use the addCssFile inside the pageRenderer object, my files are never added to the final HTML output
17:24  sorenmalling: The question is, if it's to late, the moment I can fetch the pageRenderer
17:25  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: mhh, there was a bugreport or discussion about that i think
17:25  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: your right i think it was a problem "when" it happens.
17:29  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: Even Jochen did it in his extension "sjr_offers" within the setup.txt
17:32  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: he did it some time ago with pageRenderer, but i think he changed it into setup.txt
17:39  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: maybe this works. Within the controller / initializeAction() you do a "$this->response->addAdditionalHeaderData('<!-- HEADER DATA -->');"
17:42  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: It sure did! :) I like this solution much more than the setup.txt way :)
17:42  sorenmalling: Thanks a ton!
17:42  snoy_ms: no ;-)
17:42  snoy_ms: np
17:43  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: i don't know what happens with cached and noncached controllers. But you will find out :-)
17:43  sorenmalling: Haha, that the next big question ;)
17:48  sorenmalling: Yeah, now I can clean up my setup.txt file :D
17:49  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: http://www.typo3-unleashed.net/typo3apidocs/latest/d2/d9a/classTx__Extbase__MVC__Web__Response.html#a079553d83f766f65d53809f43384c2fa
17:49  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: should be open the method info within the web_response class
17:50  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: just to have this complete
17:51  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: http://snippets.typo3.org/c/278/
17:51  sorenmalling: This is what i did :)
17:52  sorenmalling: and I will make a wrapJsFile aswell 
17:52  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: Iam wondering, because Jochen wrote this response class but didn't use this method.
17:52  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: I think it's different from developer to developer what you like :)
17:53  snoy_ms: your're right
18:10  tribunus: snoy_ms: okay, i created some tabs- now, is it possible to hide them according to what i select in a drop-down?
18:11  tribunus: i also have <onChange>reload</onChange>
18:12  snoy_ms: Within TCA i did this already, but not in flexform. Maybe someone else know that ?
18:15  snoy_ms: tribunus: maybe here? http://www.t3node.com/blog/dynamic-forms-and-types-with-typo3-flexforms/
18:31 --- tribunus_ is now known as tribunus
18:32  tribunus: mhm... maybe i should do this in tca after all... flexform seems more complicated?
18:33  tribunus: <TCEforms>
18:33  tribunus:                     <sheetTitle>myTitle</sheetTitle>
18:33  tribunus:                     <displayCond>FIELD:switchableControllerActions:=:myvalue</displayCond>
18:33  tribunus:                 </TCEforms>
18:33  tribunus: doesn't seem to work...
18:34  tribunus: or maybe the accessor is wrong?
18:36  cervera: Thank you Snoy.. 
18:36  ries: Crap.. I missed 1-11-11 11:11:11 :s
18:36  cervera: Snoy http://www.phlogi.net/t3/tsp/ does not work. What was the other link? İ lost the conversation..

19:14  cervera: The second level does not sho up
19:30  tribunus: i have a plugin backend with two tabs configured- i would like to display different fields on the second, depending on what is selected in the switchableControllerActions drop-down in the first. my accessor in the <displayCond> does not work anymore on the second sheet, though- any ideas?
19:31  tribunus: i already tried appending the name of the first sheet to the accessor- no luck
19:35  tribunus: nevermind... i guess the sheets cannot communicate with each other
19:35  iaj: hmm is there some way to tell a certain CONTENT ELEMENT to use a different header than h1 for its header field?? I want to be able to choose in layout field for example...? is there some way to do so ?

19:59  soee: guys when you are configuring RTE are you using classes assigned do tags or freeclassess also ?
21:20  iaj: where do I need to go to change the layout (h1, h2...) titles in the RTE?
21:21  iaj: and another thing... where can I adjust the functions/display names of .. the other.. hmm dunno what its called layout from rte.. the one where one can originally chose between border yellow and so on ?
21:27  cervera: http://pastebin.com/fD0appWk
21:27  cervera: please can anyone help?
21:33  Andycas: I used templavoila mapping wizard to map my design to typoscript. After the initial wizard finishes, my root template says "[ INVALID VALUE ("1") ]" and the pages are plain html
21:44  cervera: hello
21:45  cervera: anyone can give me some tips on a TS menu?
22:04 @ries: cervera: I got the extension so I can setup a paste system on the server that also hosts the logs of this channel :)
22:10  iaj: is someone up??? i don't know what's going wrong... doing the following.. have a template with following contentshttp://pastebin.com/EcLFTnpR
22:11  iaj: but whatever Layout I chose.. nothing happens :(
22:14 @ries: iaj: it looks good, you are sure the files are coorect?
22:15  iaj: they are.. do I miss something?
22:15  iaj: the labels don't make any difference.. do they?
22:16  iaj: its in the ts setup.. that's correct?
22:16 @ries: iaj: I have never used this type of templating, I use TV mainly... but it looks good...
22:16 @ries: I assume you have layout 1 selected aswell?
22:21  iaj: hmmm I was trying to use it on a ext template
22:22  HardPhuck: ries: you makin another pastebin? :)
22:22 @ries: HardPhuck: same pasteban extension... different server
22:23  HardPhuck: I assume you didn't do the direct mail job? :)
22:25  HardPhuck: ries: i started to learn java, finally
22:25 @ries: HardPhuck: good boy!!!
22:26  HardPhuck: hehe
22:26 @ries: HardPhuck: I am not sure actually... I didn't got a formal reply
22:26  HardPhuck: finally someone that gives me a pat on the back for that
22:26  HardPhuck: :)
22:26 @ries: HardPhuck: I might be doing a lot of java pretty soon again, looking forward to it
22:26 @ries: doing aso a lot of c++ nowdays... also good fun
22:29  HardPhuck: well, I did only PHP last few years so i need to get my head around different approaches and terminology
22:30  HardPhuck: we hava a java devel at the job. he's doing some Alfresco extensions and gave me the "inspiration" :)
22:31  Andycas: When I have mapped a rough template with templavoila, how do I save it to another dir for backup? Right now the files are in typo temp dir i think?
22:32 @ries: HardPhuck: Ahh Alfresco... I never really used that, I know it's not a easy system because of documentation... same as Lifray I believe
22:32 @ries: Andycas: they shouldn't be in teh temp dir... at least I ususally map from fileamdin
22:32  HardPhuck: well there aren't many java CMSs out there
22:32  HardPhuck: so i think i'll give liferay a shot
22:33  Andycas: ries, ok, there are files in templates, but where are the typoscript and stuff like that?
22:34 @ries: HardPhuck: you might want to give pulse a try...
22:34  HardPhuck: url?
22:34 @ries: Andycas: typoscript is not created by templavoila, just a bit in the XML
22:34 @ries: HardPhuck: http://pulse.torweg.org/site/Pulsar/en_US.CMS.displayCMS.13./pulse---the-java-web-application-framework
22:35  Andycas: I can see data structure xml in backend, but where is that located?
22:35  Andycas: Basically I want to take my half mapped template and work in another server
22:35  HardPhuck: thanx
22:35 @ries: Andycas: that is stored in the database
22:35 @ries: Andycas: you can just copy teh filesystem and DB
22:36  Andycas: umm... damn :)
22:51  cervera: Andycas: Use phpadmin to export the database into a gzipped file and upload on the new server. Then simple transfer the entire site folder to the new servers www folder .
22:51  Andycas: thanks cervera :)
