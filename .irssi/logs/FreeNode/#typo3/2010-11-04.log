09:24  typo3NeedHelp: hi everyone
09:25  typo3NeedHelp: i'm having troubles with typo3 in 4.4.4 version: right after the update the "List" function under Web option in the backend doesn't work anymore
09:26  PiMB: did you clear all cache
09:27  PiMB: and did everything the upgrade wizard said?
09:27  PiMB: with db compare etc.
09:29  typo3NeedHelp: with db compare it listed some tables and fiels to remove, but i'm not sure what to do "remove fields -really-"...
09:31  typo3NeedHelp: the "introduction" part says "up to date", and then there's a list of options like "installSystemExtensions"... i'm not a typo3 user, so i don't know what will happen after each modification... what are the risks etc...
09:31  PiMB: risks are your website stops working, but that won't happen so quick
09:32  PiMB: http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Upgrade
09:32  PiMB: try this for help
09:32  typo3NeedHelp: thanks PiMB
09:32  PiMB: np
09:36  typo3NeedHelp: typo3 keeps sayingthat "databases should be updated"
09:37  typo3NeedHelp: two remaining fields can't be removed -renamed with zzz prefix-
09:38  typo3NeedHelp: help my typo3 website stopped working
09:39  PiMB: relax
09:40  typo3NeedHelp: when i click on anay option uder web, there's no list that appear
09:40  PiMB: okay, but is there an error, or just no list that appears?
09:40  typo3NeedHelp: and a direct connection to the site returns "Reason: Segment "francais" was not a keyword for a postVarSet as expected!"
09:41  PiMB: okay
09:41  PiMB: that's a realurl error
09:41  PiMB: 2 different things
09:41  PiMB: first things first
09:41  PiMB: which version did you upgrade from?
09:41  Denyerek: Mornin
09:41  typo3NeedHelp: 4.2.11 --> 4.2.15 --> 4.3 --> 4.4.4
09:41  PiMB: in steps
09:41  PiMB: okay
09:42  PiMB: and did you check the backend after each upgrade?
09:42  typo3NeedHelp: yes
09:42  PiMB: alright
09:42  PiMB: and the list was visible every time?
09:42  typo3NeedHelp: yes
09:42  PiMB: alright
09:42  PiMB: and when you click list now, you get the searchbox and a grey BG, but no list right?
09:43  typo3NeedHelp: yes
09:43  PiMB: alright
09:43  PiMB: what you need to do now is a database reference check
09:43  PiMB: go to the admin option DB check in submenu admin tools
09:43  typo3NeedHelp: done
09:44  PiMB: use the dropdown to select 'manage reference index'
09:44  PiMB: and click, update now
09:44  typo3NeedHelp: done
09:44  typo3NeedHelp: ok
09:44  PiMB: be patient
09:44  PiMB: after that
09:44  PiMB: log out and log in again
09:44  typo3NeedHelp: there's two options "check the reference" and "update the reference"
09:45  typo3NeedHelp: there's two options "check reference index" and "update reference index" *
09:45  typo3NeedHelp: do i need to click both?
09:47  Denyerek: typo3NeedHelp: yOUR REALURL CONFIG IS BEnt. Ooops, caps.
09:48  PiMB: no
09:48  Denyerek: No list appearing on the tree, though, that's not so good.
09:48  PiMB: update now, like I said
09:48  PiMB: you could do check, but that only gives you stats about what he needs to do and will do after clicking update
09:48  PiMB: so no real use for that
09:48  typo3NeedHelp: there's no "update now" option
09:48  PiMB: well go for update the reference then
09:49  typo3NeedHelp: ok i try
09:51  typo3NeedHelp: done
09:51  PiMB: log out and in again
09:51  typo3NeedHelp: done
09:52  PiMB: well?
09:52  typo3NeedHelp: no list
09:53  typo3NeedHelp: every options under webshows the same empty list, except the List option that redirects to a 404 page
09:53  escapedcat: mornin'
09:53  typo3NeedHelp: good morning escapedcat
09:54  typo3NeedHelp: PiMB : but i can see my pages in the access option's 2nd column
09:55 --- Winston_S is now known as WinstonS
09:58  typo3NeedHelp: PiMB: what can i do now?
10:02  PiMB: sorry mate, had to help a colleague
10:02  PiMB: well, not sure about that
10:02  PiMB: i have seen it before, but usually reference checks and DB compares do the trick
10:02  PiMB: server up for the task?
10:03  PiMB: like php 5.2 etc.
10:03  typo3NeedHelp: is there a page where i can see that?
10:04  dec__: anyone got a basic example for showing simple text using gifbuilder?
10:04  dec__: typoscript
10:04  PiMB: http://wiki.typo3.org/GIFBUILDER
10:04  iaj: hey there.. PiMB you had that COA solution yesterday
10:04  snoy_ms: dec__: http://www.typo3.net/tsref/gifbuilder/text/
10:05  PiMB: @iaj, yeah
10:05  iaj: http://pastebin.com/sMdqLfdA  that's what it was... can I wrap that thing up with <div> ... ?
10:05  PiMB: @ typo3NeedHelp php info or the server
10:05  dec__: cheers
10:05  iaj: either with value.wrap or value.cObject.wrap?
10:07 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
10:07  typo3NeedHelp: PiMB: It suddenly beagn to work--'
10:07  typo3NeedHelp: PiMB: thank you very very very much, the listing is now visible
10:07  aterriblechaos: iaj: i would use http://pastebin.com/NmG7cbjZ
10:08  typo3NeedHelp: but the "list" option under web doesn't work --'
10:10  PiMB: doesn't work? kinda vague
10:10  PiMB: iaj, I guess
10:10  PiMB: or may even with 10.wrap = <div>|
10:10  PiMB: 20.wrap = |</div>
10:10  typo3NeedHelp: PiMB: "Connection closed by remote server" says Opera
10:11  PiMB: aterriblechaos, does that work?
10:11  PiMB: can you insert 2 data elements into one?
10:11  aterriblechaos: PiMB: untested, but should work because of insertData and value, also dataWrap=... works
10:11  PiMB: well, maybe problem with connecting to DB or something @ typo3NeedHelp
10:11  PiMB: true that
10:11  PiMB: better then
10:11  PiMB: it was late yesterday :)
10:11  aterriblechaos: :)
10:11  iaj: aterriblechaos: hm yeah.. can I have a input field with value="{TSFE|fe_user|sesData|powermail_3641|uid288}{TSFE|fe_user|sesData|powermail...}" ?
10:12  iaj: so there should only be one entry filled in?
10:12  aterriblechaos: iaj: yes, just change the snippet i posted 
10:12  iaj: PiMB: aterriblechaos thanks :)
10:12  iaj: s/:/,
10:13 * Denyerek traps the cat
10:13  aterriblechaos: if both are setted you will have a double value
10:13  PiMB: but that's not possible, because it's different forms.
10:13  PiMB: make sure you set the empty session for powermail then!
10:14  PiMB: brb
10:14  iaj: aterriblechaos: hm... that's not possible I guess - and how would I set the empy session :)?
10:15  aterriblechaos: so what do you want to do if both  are set?
10:16  aterriblechaos: i think powermail has a setting for clearing the session
10:16  PiMB: iaj, I believe it's a powermail costant setting
10:17  iaj: aterriblechaos: hmmm.. ain't I right that this powermail thingie is user dependant? eg.. the 2 forms are on 2 different pages
10:18  PiMB: yes that's true
10:18  iaj: and this form im creating is refered to from both of those sites.
10:18  PiMB: but the session is set per user as well
10:18  iaj: and the site shouldn't be accessable on its own
10:18  iaj: oh.. so if the user fills out form1. then form2 
10:18  iaj: there could be problems
10:18  PiMB: yep
10:19  PiMB: that's why you need the empty session, then on submit session is cleared
10:19  iaj: ooh.. i see.. :-) thanks!
10:19  PiMB: np
10:21  typo3NeedHelp: @PiMB: do you think "Delete temp_CACHED* files" can solve my problem?
10:22  PiMB: you can try at least
10:22  PiMB: and empty the typ3temp folder of all files while you're at it

10:59  daKmoR: hey
11:00  daKmoR: I have a question about direct_mail and sr_email_subscribe... is there any posibility to create a one click delete link inside a newsletter?
11:03  dec__: can anyone tell me what's wrong with this? http://pastebin.ca/1981481
11:03  dec__: i'm just trying to echo simple text
11:04  iaj: hi there another thing - are there some vimmers around in here maybe?   I found a syntax file for typoscript but no file for indenting :\
11:05  maholtz|WORK: morning
11:07  dec__: lo
11:09  typo3NeedHelp: @PiMB: "Reason: Segment <insert a page name here> was not a keyword for a postVarSet as expected!" this error appears on many DE and RO pages... what can i do?
11:16  MindSpark: hi, why do I have a fileadmin and a upload dir ?
11:16  MindSpark: and why can't I include files from the upload directory using the fileadmin ?
11:29  typo3NeedHelp: please, need some help :S
11:31  maholtz|WORK: @typo3NeedHelp: sounds as you do not have filled in many page-names? where do you have <insert a page name here> check why it is not filled with an page name
11:32  typo3NeedHelp: no, it is filled with a pagename, i wrote this because it appears everywhere one my dutch part of the site
11:35  typo3NeedHelp: ok i think i found how to solve this problem, but my List option stillnot fixed :S
11:35  PiMB: the page segment is a realurl error
11:35  PiMB: and sorry for the slow response, I'm at work and have meetings from time to time mate
11:36  typo3NeedHelp: @PiMB: no problem, your work is more important, i can wait ;|
11:37  typo3NeedHelp: i can't use parenthesis, but it is a smile, note a neutral face
11:40  maholtz|WORK: is it possible to set default values in irre elements?
11:41  aterriblechaos: maholtz|WORK: should work by setting tca defaults
11:42  maholtz|WORK: i would like to put tt_content into irre, so that defaults would influence the normal elements too i think?
11:43  aterriblechaos: yes i think so
11:46  maholtz|WORK: hm.. could be a solution
11:46  maholtz|WORK: if you create an record, you will usually select the column
11:46  maholtz|WORK: thanks for the pointer
11:58  sorenmalling: Anyone here used the viewhelper cObj with lib.stdheader to make a graphic header?
12:02  escapedcat: sorenmalling: for creating graphical headers in fluid?
12:02  sorenmalling: escapedcat: Yep, but i found a way
12:02  sorenmalling: <f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath="lib.stdheader" data="{header : material.title}"/>
12:02  escapedcat: sorenmalling: ah ok. just did that last week :)
12:02  sorenmalling: escapedcat: Same solution? :)
12:03  escapedcat: sorenmalling: yepp
12:03  sorenmalling: Great, I'm glad to hear :)
12:04  escapedcat: sorenmalling: some of those three different approaches
12:04  escapedcat: i mean "one"
12:20  titii: Hello frieds
12:56  titii: I am using templavoila, and I have one Page-Content element mapped... I want to use PIDinRootline condition in one page root with Typoscript. I dont know what snippet can I use, without TV it was styles.content.get < plugin... Please help :)
12:56  titii: Is it possible?
12:57  titii: How in TV can I set with Typoscript content element, or COA, and so on..
13:00  aterriblechaos: titii: you need to map it as typoscript path, than you can change this part in typscript setup
13:01  titii: aterriblechaos: ok, but how to list with Typoscipt the content elements?
13:01  daKmoR: I have a question about direct_mail and sr_email_subscribe... is there any posibility to create a one click delete link inside a newsletter?
13:01  iaj: aterriblechaos: i just tried it but the {TSFE part is inserted directly to my insert field... http://pastebin.com/aW60chUn   that's what I put in my template
13:01  iaj: ^ PiMB as well.
13:02  aterriblechaos: iaj: use TEXT and not HTML
13:03  iaj: aterriblechaos: thanks!
13:03  aterriblechaos: titii: why cant you insert the plugin on the page as normal content? would be much simpler
13:04  iaj: aterriblechaos: ITS WORKING :)
13:04  iaj: thaaaaaanks :)
13:05  titii: aterriblechaos: Yea but I have one page as a Shop and in here are the subpages as a categories, and a client dont want to insert the plugin element into every page
13:07  aterriblechaos: titii: i would map element after or before your content and add there a typscript object path .. but im not expirenced with tv, im shure there is a better solution
13:08  titii: aterriblechaos: thanks, now im going to do this right this way :) I cant find also the better solution... ok thanks

17:37  PiMB: typoscript template that is.
17:37  PiMB: ?
