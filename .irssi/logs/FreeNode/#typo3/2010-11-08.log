08:19  mustache: hi. how can i add a ttf font file to typo3 page?
08:20  mustache: so i could use that font with css)
08:20  groendraakie: ah fontsquirrel
08:21  groendraakie: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator
08:21  groendraakie: generates a webfont from the ttf and creates examples css and html pages
08:22  mustache: h_fontsquirrel? it's an extension?
08:22  groendraakie: nope, a website
08:22  groendraakie: it's actually typo3-unrelated. It's html-css
08:23  mustache: oh, okay.. tried it.. looks nice :)
08:23  mustache: thanks :)
08:24  groendraakie: your welcome :)
08:33  mustache: works like a charm >) I am really thankful
08:34  groendraakie: I know, I use it extensively. I hate using images for headers and the such
08:34  mustache: me too
08:35  mustache: but i didn't know how to use custom fonts up to this point
08:35  groendraakie: so GIFBUILDER is nice, but I don't use it for text
08:36  groendraakie: ah. That's the nice thing about having html-wizards for colleagues
08:37  mustache: :)
08:42  PiMB: GIFBUILDER actually really nice with that.
08:43  _ramo: hi
08:43  PiMB: problem with those fonts replacers is mainly that you need flash and/or javascript
08:43  PiMB: GIFBUILDER doesn't
08:43  groendraakie: sorry, but css doesn't either in proper browsers
08:43  PiMB: ?
08:44  groendraakie: @font-face in css
08:44  PiMB: yeah alright
08:44  groendraakie: no javascript, no flash, just modern css 
08:44  PiMB: but that's not (yet) properly supported by all major browsers
08:44  groendraakie: works in IE7> firefox, chrome, etc
08:44  PiMB: so, I agree, but it's not there yet
08:44  groendraakie: IE6 is not a proper browser, Microsift says so themselves :)
08:45  PiMB: still agree, but ever tried to convince a big client of that statement?
08:46  BenjaminS: morning
08:50  PiMB: Hi
09:20  dokma: maholtz|WORK, ries, Denyerec: guys do you know how I can render a TS object from PHP. In particular I would like something like: renderTS('plugin.tx_mhbranchenbuch_pi1');
09:20  Denyerec: OUch.
09:20  Denyerec: (ANd hello Dok :D)
09:21  Denyerec: I know where you could look, but it might be scary.
09:21  Denyerec: In TemplaVoila when you map something as a Typoscript Object PAth
09:21  Denyerec: that obviously gets rendered by *something*
09:22  Denyerec: If you could find in the source where that takes place, it might give some clue.
09:22  Denyerec: Beyond that, I'm sadly useless to you :(
09:22  Denyerec: brb
09:24  maholtz|WORK: @dokma: $this->cObj->cObjGetSingle($conf['renderMe'], $conf['renderMe.']);
09:24  maholtz|WORK: renderMe < plugin.tx_mhbranchenbuch_pi1
09:24  maholtz|WORK: keep caching in mind
09:25  maholtz|WORK: perhaps you should set renderMe = USER_INT
09:26  Denyerec: maholtz to the rescue :D
09:42  dokma: maholtz|WORK: I found that exact solution
09:45  mg_: hello
09:46  mg_: is there an extension for typo3 (and/or the snowflake blog extension) to tweet on a new post, even if it is sceduled for a time in the future? so tweet and post should be posted on the same time
09:49  dokma: hey Denyerec! I'm getting calls on the phone all the time...
09:49  dokma: I'm getting a bit of heat
09:49  dokma: Denyerek ;)
09:49  Denyerek: hey Dok
09:49  dokma: It's a bit of a pressure to finish this
09:49  dokma: so I must focus but I'll get back here!
09:50  dokma: are you ok man?
09:54  dokma: maholtz|WORK: I've got another issue. I'm trying to do insert rgsmoothgalley into mh_branchenbuch (company directory) so the problem is that $this->conf array contains only setup for mh_branchenbuch and now I need a way to load plugin.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1 from PHP
09:55  sorenmalling: dokma: Merge the configuration in to a part of the mh_branchebuch typoscript ? plugin.tx_brachenbuch_pi1.something < plugin.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1
09:56  dokma: yes that is one option... but I found this: $GLOBALS['TSFE']->tmpl->setup
09:56  dokma: it contains the entire TS setup
09:56  sorenmalling: and is heavy!
09:57  dokma: so I just fetch: $GLOBALS['TSFE']->tmpl->setup['plugin.']['tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1.']
09:57  sorenmalling: yes
09:57  dokma: sorenmalling: it seems to me it's better to use the existing setup rather than to copy stuff around and make it even heavier?
09:57  maholtz|WORK: @dokma: plugin.tx_youplugin_pi1.mhbranchenbuch < plugin.mh_banchenbuch
09:58  maholtz|WORK: and plugin.tx_yourplugin_pi1.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1 < plugin.tx_rgsmooth... ?
09:58  dokma: maholtz|WORK: or maybee better a <=
09:58  maholtz|WORK: depends on
09:58 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
09:58  maholtz|WORK: if you make a copy, you can change the config, just for your plugin
09:58  dokma: ahhh.... yes it makes sense
09:59  maholtz|WORK: if you use  $GLOBALS['TSFE']->tmpl->setup['plugin.']['tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1.'] directly
09:59  dokma: maholtz|WORK: thanks ... that's exactly what I've been looking for
09:59  maholtz|WORK: you cannt do something like
09:59  maholtz|WORK: tmp < plugin.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1
09:59  maholtz|WORK: plugin.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1 = COA
09:59  maholtz|WORK: plugin.tx_rgsmoothgallery_pi1.10 < tmp
10:00  dokma: I'm not getting these last 3 lines

10:10  Denyerek: hey dokma, I'm doing OK I guess. Very tired most of the time :)  How are you getting on ?
10:24  ndee: is it possible to get the absolut site url in an extension?
10:38  ndee: anyone using the google custom search on their site?
10:47  elmargol: Is there a typo3 extensions that allows me to drag upload images zu my typo3 site?
10:47  elmargol: to my typo3 site
10:48  elmargol: like attachements in gmail maybe?
10:56  kraftb: hi !
10:58  Denyerek: Hey Kraft
11:05  floxx: hi there...anyone tried the prev_article/next_article links for tt_news single view (new implemented since 3.0.0) with articles of type "link to internal page"?
11:06  floxx: if next article is of type internal page, it though links to the detail view and not to the linked page - for that it outputs "no news_id given"
11:07  floxx: it's my fault or a bug?
11:16  jbaptiste_j: Greetings, recently there is a new variable that appears at the end of some of the URLs of my Typo3 site it goes as such ?L=0  It looks like somehow the site is behaving like it has an option for multilinguism except tha tI never intendedly design it that wa and it fucks up some of my procedures for monitoring new contents. Is there a way for me to quickly find the source for this unwanted...
11:16  jbaptiste_j: ...variable ?
11:30  sorenmalling: elmargol: Try http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/ameos_dragndropupload/current/
11:30  sorenmalling: jbaptiste_j: Is it from results of indexed_search? 
11:32  jbaptiste_j: actuallt I use Website watcher to monitor the changes on the website, it is this which gives me results with L=0 Only search i i'm using inthis site is the one that comes with tt_news 
11:40  groendraakie: I'm having trouble with the tinyRTE-plugin. When it is installed, I'm logged out when I try to save a text-content element
11:40  groendraakie: Actually, it puts a separate be_typo_user cookie
11:41  groendraakie: Anyone have this problem?
11:44  jbaptiste_j: but sorenmalling what you said makes sense because this extra variable only appeared after I added a tt-news module wih list and search
11:45  sorenmalling: jbaptiste_j: I've had the issue with indexed_search appending a &L=0 to my links in search result. Dunno if tt_news search does the same
11:46  groendraakie: Anyone using TinyRTE?
11:46  jbaptiste_j: mybe I should remove the "use sub categories" in the plugin ?

12:49  DNukem: Hello everybody, i've got a "ext_tables_static+adt.sql" question. I am trying to INSERT INTO in this file, but target is not a static table created in this file. Instead its an standard table defined in ext_tables.sql. I am trying to add "sample" or quiete standard content into a table on installation to start off with. Nothing is added to the table, what am i doing wrong?
12:59  _ramo: hi
13:00  _ramo: are there any typo3 extensions for user tracking ?
13:00  PiMB: http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/loginusertrack/current/
13:02  _ramo: PiMB: may be something like, heatmaps, or how long was a user on a site, etc.
13:04  Winston_S: _ramo: maybe have a look at this one: http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/ke_stats/current/ . it works pretty good for me.
13:08  _ramo: thank you
14:48  Dr4g0n: Hello
14:51  Dr4g0n: i have a little question about the introduction package, on the bottem are licenses termes, they link to -> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/ch/deed.en_GB
14:53  Dr4g0n: whats mean with this termes? totaly unusefull for webdeveloper? or only a bug?
14:57  ries: anybody ever seen queries like this : SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tx_templavoila_datastructure WHERE pid IN (16,248,.....,242,0)  AND tx_templavoila_datastructure.deleted=0   AND (uid LIKE '%no_cache%' OR title LIKE '%no_cache%' OR dataprot LIKE '%no_cache%');
14:59  ries: Dr4g0n: it is just a notification on how you can use the templates  and graphics
15:00  Dr4g0n: its not allowed to edit the template and use it as a new "commercial" template ?
15:09  ries: Dr4g0n: sure it is, that's why it's creative commons
15:09  ries: it states: You are free to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work
15:09  ries: Ahhh crap
15:10  ries: No indeed
15:10  ries: you are right, you are not allowed to use it commercially
15:10  ries: That's odd.....
15:10  ries: Dr4g0n: where did you download this package? I want to raise teh question on the mailing list
15:11  ries: because according to this license you are not even allowed to change the TS to play around because it states 'You may not alter, transform, or build upon this work.'
15:11  Dr4g0n: yes, i think, typo3 is free and open source.... this is against the typo3 principles
15:11  Dr4g0n: yes
15:11  ries: Dr4g0n: absolutely agree, that's why I want to start the discussion
15:11  Dr4g0n: but typo3 say, its for the first steps with typo and make the start easy
15:12  ries: Dr4g0n: yup! so these two items conflict with eachother
15:12  Dr4g0n: ries: you are a normal user or a moderator or something like that? 
15:13  ries: Dr4g0n: both I guess
15:13  ries: I can moderate the channel
15:13  ries: but I am by no means official TYPO3, part of core or what so ever
15:14  ries: just using typo3 for a very long time
15:14  Dr4g0n: aahh
15:15  Dr4g0n: that was in the normal download form sourcefroge... version 4.4
15:15  Dr4g0n: introductionpackage-4.4.4.zip
15:18  Denyerek: hey ries
15:21  ries: Hey Denyerek 
15:21  ries: Dr4g0n: I send a mail to typo3-english

20:30  saedelaere: is it possible to define the standard workspace for a backend user??
20:31  saedelaere: currently they all start with the [LIVE Workspace], would like to change that.
20:38  saedelaere: can a user publish content without having access to the LIVE workspace. Seems not to be possible. User is member and reviewer.
20:46  dokma: Fruchthoernschen: intincscript is another was of saying USERINT object... they are non cacheable and rendered after the pagetitle so I was unable to override pagetite
20:46  dokma: I ended up rendering the plugin as USER object and now it works
21:14  Fruchthoernschen: hehe lol okay 
21:14  Fruchthoernschen: never read/heard about the writing "intincscript"
