08:19  soee: any idea why be editor adds paragraphs and br when enter key is pressed ?
08:43  Guschtel: soee: both?
08:43  Guschtel: should only add paragraphs
08:43  Guschtel: Shift+Enter adds a <br />
08:45  soee: Gu yeah both, end if i remove br maualy, when content is (in RTE <h2>text</h2><p>text</p>) iv got -> <h2>text</h2><p><br /></p><p>text</p>
08:45  soee: :<
08:45  soee: *content i s rendered
08:45  soee: and i have no idea where did that <p><br /></p> came from

08:52  HardPhuck: morning
09:11  soee: kingdom for answer :/
09:28  iaj: lo there
09:29  iaj: maybe someone got an idea.. we want to create something like a private area.. where some particular users (with user/pass) got access to and files can get shared... (or only viewed, respectively) - is there any way to achieve that goal with typo - elseway I'd just stick to dropbox and generate a howto install/use guide for the users ( like 20 max )
09:39  pharno: iaj: well, it would be possible, but Id stick to dropbox
09:39  pharno: because people like drag and drop
09:39  iaj: pharno: yeah.. thought so - so dropbox might be the best choice here...
09:39  pharno: and because its in the explorer 
09:39  iaj: i hope they are intelligent enough for installing it :PP
10:19  aterriblechaos: good morning #typo3
10:21  pharno: morning
10:22  pharno: someone an idea why clamd is eating 98-99.99% cpu?

10:41  neoneye: within typoscript.. how do I expand a some raw html containing a typolink... so that the typolink becomes an <a> tag ? 
10:41  neoneye: the raw html is extracted from tt_content
10:42  escapedcat: hi
10:43  neoneye: I have gazed through the class.tslib_content.php, but cannot see any obvious way to do it
10:47  neoneye: I guess I can expand it via $this->cObj->CONTENT within php
10:48  CoreTex: hi @all
10:49  CoreTex: I try to install phoenix today, but I alway get Failed opening required 'PHPUnit/Autoload.php'
10:50  CoreTex: but PHPUnit via debian package oder via pear doesn't have a Autoload.php
10:50  CoreTex: has anybody a tip for me ?
11:05  aterriblechaos: CoreTex: what version of PHPUnit you are using? 
11:06  CoreTex: I tried both
11:06  CoreTex: PHPUnit  1.3.2 (stable)  1.3.2 Regression testing framework for unit tests.
11:06  CoreTex: PHPUnit2 2.3.6 (stable)  2.3.6 Regression testing framework for unit tests.
11:07  aterriblechaos: neoneye: if you really need to parse typolinks in a html element you have to use parseFunc in typoscript
11:07  aterriblechaos: CoreTex: you need at least 3.4 ..
11:09  CoreTex: is this version in pear beta ?
11:10  aterriblechaos: i think so .. just follow the install tutorial of phpunit: http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html
11:13  neoneye: aterriblechaos: thank you.. will check it out asap
11:22  kevke: Since yesterday, our typo3 install acts weird. We have a custom extension for articles. It worked for (give or take) 4 Month like a charm, but now all content by this particular extension is given out in HTML. How likely is it, that this is a retarded programing mistake? Btw, the extension uses RTE. And does anyone have a clue, how to make it tick again?
11:23  kevke: So... sorry, it is not the install, it's the ext
11:24  kevke: and btw: If I make a new CE with this ext, it works like it is supposed to.
11:24  aterriblechaos: kevke: as i sayd yesterday, you should compare the db content of the working and the non working articles .. hard to say what caused your problem
11:26  kevke: hmm, now, i get it, I think... I should check pma and find out where the difference btwn the working and the non working articles are
11:26  kevke: How do I find them, by text or by uid?
11:26  aterriblechaos: yes, thats what i would do .. just search them by uid
11:30  neoneye: aterriblechaos: thank you thank you thank you.. parseFunc works!!! 
11:30  CoreTex: aterriblechaos: thx it works ;-)
11:31  CoreTex: but now i get 500 Internal Server Error PDOException
11:34  aterriblechaos: CoreTex: and what message? probably missing some db driver or something
11:35  CoreTex: Uncaught exception. could not find driver in line 89 of /var/www/typo3_dev5/Packages/Framework/FLOW3/Classes/Persistence/Backend/GenericPdo/Backend.php.
11:37  aterriblechaos: CoreTex: make shure that php_pdo is installed, i think you need php_pdo_sqlite too
12:18  kevke: aterriblechaos, found out more, which makes me think even more something strange is going on. the RTE does not process html at all. it just puts everything out in plain text, which should have been rendered. I did not notice this at first, since I just added text without formating it. If I boldify text, it just keeps the text like it is. Assuming I would add a table (a table table, not a typo3 table) I get "table width=559 border=0 cellp
12:18  kevke: adding=7 cellspacing=0 height=71 lt;col..." So it might be related to a rte post within the forum, which I will check out now
12:22  iaj: lo there - is there some way to encrypt an url somehow? (eg. not just the basic index.php?id= stuff..) but staying on the same domain?
12:28  kevke: what do you mean exactly, something like domain.tld/68a&(a ?

12:51  soee: how can i get rid of empty paragraphs ?
13:14  soee: ok this is strange, i removed my RTE config
13:14  soee: and if i add Text xontent element there are default settings in RTE
13:15  soee: but editor in tt_products has my settings all the time
13:15  Nugae: hi everyone. its posible to insert movie like avi or swf to rte (record from tx_dam extension) and how to do it? :)
13:15  soee: any idea what can be wrong ?
13:19  HardPhuck: Nugae, maybe by inserting code directly, otherwise no
13:21  HardPhuck: swf that is, avi can't be just added to any web page
13:21  Nugae: any others solutions? i must add button similar to "insert image"
13:21  HardPhuck: yes, define FCE for templavoila
13:22  Nugae: it`s must be integreated with rte

14:05  HardPhuck: can i add additional attributes to body tag from another TV field?
14:05  HardPhuck: i have a field named field_background
14:08  dec__: i've got a very specific templavoila issue.. when i export my TemplaVoila folder as XML, I lose mapping from all the DS except 1.. when I export it as t3d, it seems to work fine.. however it is essential that I export it as XML (long story but take my word for it)... is there any known issues with the XML export?
14:13  jananne: when i've been mapping with TV en looking back in my HTML, TV changes the HTML code. E.g. <table><tr><td>Hello World!</td></tr></table> to <table><tr><td>Hello World!</td></table></table>. So in this example it's replacing the </tr>. I didn't map anything nearby this table. Anyone formiliar with this problem?
14:17  jananne: see: http://beta.dehaanmedia.nl/csbbreukers.nl/index.php?id=home <-- i just uploaded the template and mapped a couple things, didn't do nothing else.
14:18  jananne: look @ the footer.
14:26  ndee: hey there, anyone got experience with nc_staticfilecache? We have a problem: We have the LIST and SINGLE view on the same page. We don't want to cache our Single-View since we have comments on them (plugin.tt_news = USER_INT if a page has the tt_news[tt_news] GET-var set). Now, the problem is: sometimes, it still caches the page detail view and I can't find a pattern why it does it like that.
14:30  ndee: nc_staticfilecache sometimes caches the detail view and I need to deactivate that somehow
14:36  jananne: everybody is inactive :o
14:36  jananne: and i can't help ya (a)
14:37  FloLeBlanc: hi all
14:38  FloLeBlanc: did someone ever experience a complete="true" tag in his/her images? (typo3 4.4) - where does that come from?
14:47  soee: any idea why i  heva some extra <br /> in my content that is enterd in RTE ?
14:47  soee: extra when is rendered on FE
14:50  jananne: soee: try entering breaks with SHIFT+ENTER :)
14:51  soee: jananne, thats not it in RTE i have only one header and one paragraph (HTML source) but when the content is rendered i have some <br /> :/
14:54  Nugae: hi. how to integrate tx_dam with rte, a want to insert swf movie into rte content, something like "insert image button". its possible?
14:54  soee: argh this is how it looks like now: http://tinypic.com/r/20s8zv4/7
14:55  soee: the problem lies here: <p><h2>tekst</h2><br /></p>
14:55  soee: this is how rendered content source looks like, but in the editro there is only header
14:58  soee: is i set h2 tag into external blocks (lib.parseFunc_RTE.externalBlocks = h2) content looks like: <h2>tekst</h2><p><br /></p>
14:58  soee: and i nned to get rid of this <p><br /></p>
15:01  Nugae: its possible to use indexed_search with new caching_framework? or you suggest other search?
15:01  iaj: someone can tell me how I could have a long cryptic url for a specific page in my typo pagetree - but with www.mydomain. at the beginning?
15:07  aterriblechaos: iaj: you could enter a long cryptic alias
15:07  iaj: aterriblechaos: aaaaaaaaaah tahnks!
15:07  iaj: that's so golden
15:10  HardPhuck: can i completely prevent typo3 from adding body tag?
15:12  aterriblechaos: HardPhuck: i think you can just unset it in setup .. page.bodyTag >
15:13  HardPhuck: nope
15:13  HardPhuck: doesn't remove it
15:18  aterriblechaos: seems that you need a bodyTag or bodyTagCObject .. you could set bodyTag=< and add your own body with body class=""> ..
15:20  HardPhuck: the problem is that i mapped the body the "outer" way so i can access it's property
15:20  HardPhuck: which means i now have two body tags
15:21  kevke: Regarding html code in frontent with a particular extension: I found out, that if I use the built-in txt extension, the html is rendered correctly. And if the third-party kind of extension is used, it prompts html-code. The question is, how can I make this ext tick again. I know this sounds like me going to the doctor complaining about my wife's upset stomach,but maybe someone has a little insight, where to look for
15:21  soee: HardPhuck, u can replace it with &nbsp; or somthing else than
15:21  aterriblechaos: HardPhuck yes ... still possible, just wrap it with body> instead of <body>
15:22  HardPhuck: soee i still have two </body> tags at the end if i do that
15:23  aterriblechaos: HardPhuck: why dont you set page.bodyTag=<body , and in your ds you wrap the mapped body part with | id=".."> 
15:24  HardPhuck: because the attribute is bgcolor which needs to be filled in a custom templavoila field for each page
15:25  aterriblechaos: what speaks again .dataWrap=| bgcolor="{field:mybgcolor}"> in ds ?
15:25  MarcelT3: lo
15:26  HardPhuck: hmm so i do inner wrap to leave the body out and add this to some field
15:27  aterriblechaos: yes .. you should also be able to add it to the typscript part of the mapped body, but im by no means a tv pro
15:28  HardPhuck: hmm i doubt i can change body tag from inside DS
15:29  HardPhuck: let me try
15:29  aterriblechaos: not change, just add the needet tag and close it .. in typoscript you set page.bodyTag=<body , without closing the tag
15:30  aterriblechaos: else i think you have to use some extension that gets the content of a tv field and set it in typoscript setup
15:31  HardPhuck: yeah i think i'll do that
16:02  HardPhuck: ok done. installed an extension
16:17  kevke: Regarding the html and rte issue, please check this out. Maybe you can get a little mor insight, ehrre my problem is! Thank you
16:17  kevke: http://pastebin.com/Q5Er8cbN
16:19  dokma: kevke I don't get what is the exact problem....
16:26  kevke: repeated: Since yesterday, our typo3 install acts weird. We have a custom extension for articles.

16:32  PiMB: @kevke, a url? maybe output gives a clue
16:32  kevke: aye
16:33  kevke: http://www.proserion.com/information/about-trade-fairs/fairs-2011/cologne-koeln/january-2011/imm-cologne/
16:34  PiMB: it just deletes all your < and >
16:34  kevke: As you see, before the rte kicks in, all is fine. Headlines are correct.
16:34  kevke: Is there a simple way to fix this
16:35  PiMB: not sure what is wron
16:35  PiMB: and you say nothing has changed?
16:35  kevke: nope
16:35  PiMB: no extensions upgrades or anything
16:35  kevke: no
16:35  kevke: all that was done, was not related to the particular extension. 
16:36  soee: not extension but maybe related to RTE - somme changes
16:37  kevke: another already existing CE of another extension (which does not use rte) was changed.
16:37  kevke: by changed I mean the content, not the extension itself
16:39  soee: kevke, and if u edit this content all is fine ?
16:39  kevke: unfortunately not
16:39  soee: in RTE i mean
16:40  kevke: me too
16:40  soee: so check in database how the content looks like
16:40  soee: if < > were strip from DB content than its a big problem
16:45  kevke: It looks bad: http://pastebin.com/MkyYgV0C
16:48  soee: well the content is passed through htmlentities or smth
16:48  kevke: That would lead to the following question: What lead to this problem, how do I get rid of it.
16:49  soee: does the new content u add looks the same ?
16:50  kevke: yepp
16:50  soee: and new content is also displayed with html tags ?
16:50  soee: well tags without  < >
16:51  kevke: yes, but only this particular extension. A text ce is fine
16:51  soee: give me extension name
16:51  kevke: its a custom one
16:52  kevke: not in ter
16:52  kevke: I could export the ext
16:52  soee: ok, show me pls maybe i can help than
16:56  snoy_ms: kevke: done a core update? Is it an extbase extension ?
16:57  snoy_ms: kevke: just saw such effects when using templavoila and fluid...
16:58  kevke: not using tv
16:58  kevke: fluit not sure
16:59  kevke: http://www.proserion.com/T3X_rw_article-0_0_0-z-201012011654.t3x
17:01  kevke: btw all installed exts here: http://pastebin.com/yTwanSQN (sorry for the mass)
17:01  snoy_ms: kevke: its an pi1 stile extension. no fluid used
17:01  kevke: thx
17:02  kevke: was not sure, but thought of it
17:02  kevke: I am not a programmer, more then basic skills and I start running away
17:04  snoy_ms: The behavior is strange.
17:04  snoy_ms: kevke: check also DB
17:07  soee: kevke, http://www.mail-archive.com/typo3-english@lists.netfielders.de/msg16359.html
17:08  soee: hers the start of the thread http://www.mail-archive.com/typo3-english@lists.netfielders.de/msg16212.html
17:13  kevke: where exactly and what for? I did uid lookups which are not promising (or seeing  this thread, is it? I did not thought about, that this could actually be code, but gibberish hogwash) )
17:14  kevke: soee, you made my day, i could kiss you, if this works (have not applied yet, I most certainly will kiss you twice)
17:16  soee: before any changes, modification do backup 
17:22  pharno: n8 guys
17:26  kevke: backing up database as we speak (100MB and counting)
17:28  soee: db 100 mb ?
17:28  PiMB: 100 mB?
17:28  soee: empty cache_extension table
17:28  PiMB: how big are your cache_* tables?
17:28  PiMB: you can empty those
17:28  MarcelT3: cache_* and index_* could recalculated anyway -- do you guys include dem in backups?
17:29  PiMB: index_ depends
17:29  PiMB: cache usually not really
17:30  MarcelT3: it appears that the sys_log grows fastest, it could be excluded from "backups for development purposes"
17:30  PiMB: also yes
17:31  kevke: hmm
17:31  kevke: stopped at 301 mb
17:31  MarcelT3: backed up at command line?
17:31  soee: compressed ot not ? :D
17:32  kevke: via pma
17:32  MarcelT3: or did the backup php-script reach the timeout
17:32  kevke: not compressed
17:32  MarcelT3: hope all your data is in the file!
17:33  MarcelT3: pma often reaches the maximum time for execution and just stops sending data, better check twice
17:33  kevke: hmm, the ttl *ping* lets do this by hand again
17:33  kevke: has anyone a how to somewhere, last time was 5 yrs ago
17:34  MarcelT3: mysqldump -h :D
17:34  aterriblechaos: mysqldump -u username -p mydatabase>backupfile.sql
17:39  MarcelT3: does somebody know about an integrity check for files in TYPO3 (fileadmin/* uploads/*) like it exists for db entries (sys_refindex) without using dam ?
17:41  kevke: running
17:43  kevke: done
17:44  kevke: was consistent with the download via pma, but to say a german phrase attention is the mother of the porcelain box.
17:45  MarcelT3: hehe
17:49  zorzar: hey, what's the easiest way to add a reference to a frontend user to a extbase model?
17:52  snoy_ms: zorzar: inherit the frontend user model
17:52  kevke: oh by the way, where does the t3lib_div::array2xml live?
17:53  zorzar: snoy_ms: i'd like to have it as a atribute
17:54  snoy_ms: zorzar: http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-mvc/repository/entry/extbase/trunk/Classes/Domain/Model/FrontendUser.php
17:54  snoy_ms: zorzar: normaly a model extends the frontenduser class
17:55  snoy_ms: kevke: here http://typo3.org/fileadmin/typo3api-4.0.0/d6/d99/class_8t3lib__div_8php-source.html
17:56  snoy_ms: kevke: within the t3lib/class.t3lib_div.php
17:57  zorzar: snoy_ms: i don't want to implement a new frontend user, that inherits from FrondendUser, but want to assign a frontenduser to a model
17:58  snoy_ms: zorzar: If you assing a frontend user as attribute you need a type for that
17:58  zorzar: snoy_ms: yeah and i have to implement my own type for that?
18:00  snoy_ms: zorzar: How do you want to get a fronend user and assing it to you model?
18:00  snoy_ms: zorzar: i never used it, but i think you need a fronend model
18:00  zorzar: snoy_ms: ok thought, it might be a builtin type
18:04  snoy_ms: zorzar: Tx_Extbase_Domain_Model_FrontendUser
18:04  snoy_ms: zorzar: but that doesn't looks nice. Extbase comes with this type (model) and its repository
18:05  zorzar: ok
18:05  snoy_ms: zorzar: just build your own and extends it with Tx_Extbase_Domain_Model_FrontendUser
18:05  zorzar: snoy_ms: alright, i'll look into that
18:06  snoy_ms: zorzar: also check out Tx_Extbase_Domain_Model_FrontendUserGroup
18:06  snoy_ms: if you need that
18:06  zorzar: snoy_ms: i have to edit the tca end ext_tables myself, right?
18:06  zorzar: snoy_ms: no just need users, but thanks
18:07  snoy_ms: yes, there is that extension builder for extbase. But i didn't use it.
18:07  zorzar: snoy_ms: do you mean the kickstarter?
18:08  snoy_ms: zorzar: yes
18:10  zorzar: snoy_ms: ok yeah that builds a good base, but as far as i know you can't change extensions with it
18:10  snoy_ms: zorzar: only one time, after that it rewrites eveyrthing :-(
18:11  zorzar: yeah
18:12  snoy_ms: zorzar: you can use typoscript to configure special mapping, too. For example a person model mapped to a tt_adress entry.
18:12  snoy_ms: zorzar: but try to use ready to go magic out of extbase like the frontenduser
18:19  snoy_ms: zorzar: check how easy that is http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-mvc/repository/entry/blog_example/trunk/Classes/Domain/Model/Administrator.php
18:20  snoy_ms: zorzar: don't forget to map the fe user on your model -> http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-mvc/repository/entry/blog_example/trunk/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.txt
18:21  snoy_ms: zorzar: line 9 to 20 ( i don't know if this up to date). They changed alot in last month
18:24  snoy_ms: zorzar: or here http://books.google.de/books?id=qihZuW_rk5oC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=extensions+mit+extbase+frontenduser&source=bl&ots=SL7MDD-KG_&sig=jcIUvDjCLdEFOdxrGlcxQQFymGE&hl=de&ei=sIL2TO_rOYXtOaKY-agI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mapping&f=false

18:27  iaj: i got a question - does someone know how I can change the FROM adress which the sender of the form receives?
18:27  snoy_ms: zorzar: last thing! you see alot of mapping stuff. That because they used "single table inherence"
18:27  snoy_ms: zorzar: normaly you don't need such alot mappings in your ts.
18:28  snoy_ms: zorzar: for example if you use a table for every model. They used just one and a recordTpe filed. Soooo have fun ;-)
