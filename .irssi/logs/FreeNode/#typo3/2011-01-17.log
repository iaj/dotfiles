00:04  SuperBear: Can someone please tell me how I can locate the TypoScript so that I can edit: "page.config.tx_m1_google_analytics"
00:10  SuperBear: Guess everyone is sleeping. 
00:10 --- SuperBear is now known as SuperBear-zzz
00:10  SuperBear-zzz: Welcome ries!
00:11  SuperBear-zzz: Is anyone talking?
00:15  Denyerec: It's sleepytime in Europe
00:15  Denyerec: So I guess most people are zzz
00:20  SuperBear-zzz: Its 6:20pm EST in the USA
00:20 --- SuperBear-zzz is now known as SuperBear
00:21  SuperBear: Are you familiar with TypoScript Denyerec?  I'm trying to find out where I can edit "page.config.tx_m1_google_analytics"  I installed the Google Analytics extension and cannot seem to locate where TypoScript will allow me to make the changes to fully implement it into my site.
00:22  ries: hey SuperBear 
00:22  Denyerec: you'll need to edit the site TS template
00:22  ries: hey Denyerec , how are you doing?
00:22  Denyerec: click the root page of the site in the page tree, then click the "template" module on the left site
00:22  Denyerec: Hey Ries!
00:22  Denyerec: I'm OK
00:22  Denyerec: Bit fed up with work making silly decisions, but otherwise OK.
00:23  Provito: Hey Denyerec
00:23  Denyerec: Hey Provito :)
00:24 * Denyerec really should be in bed
00:24  Denyerec: BUT, I am quickly processing some pictures from my GF's poledancing club
00:24  Denyerec: Sooo, it's a tough call.
00:24  Provito: I've got a 5 minute window before a scheduled 23:30 maintenace
00:24  Denyerec: And you're on IRC? :D
00:24  Provito: ooo link please :)
00:24  Denyerec: I guess you must love the pressure ;)
00:25  Provito: hah no pressure, backups are being undertaken at 23:30 I'll flip the site into maintenance mode with my ip whitelisted and begin the upgrade
00:25  Provito: 30 minutes window tops
00:29  SuperBear: Denyerec, was not able to locate that option
00:29  Denyerec: You have a list of things on the left side of the admin page, correct?
00:29  Denyerec: Page, Info, etc ?
00:31  SuperBear: I am using Typo3 4.4.4.  On the far left of the backend, I see Page, View, List, Info, Access, Functions, Template, News Admin, templaVoila, recycler, mm_forum, Site Config (all listed on WEB).  I also have FILE, USER TOOLS, ADMIN TOOLS and HELP
00:32  SuperBear: My instructions say:  "All configuration parameters for this extension should be in your template TypoScript, inside the page.config.tx_m1_google_analytics container. Please see the option descriptions below."
00:34  SuperBear: My problem is, I do not know how to locate the "TyopScript" to make the changes to "page.config.tx_m1_google_analytics" to make Google Analytics work.
00:37  Denyerec: yeah
00:37  Denyerec: I'm trying to explain
00:37  Denyerec: You see where it says "Template" on the left ?
00:37  Denyerec: Click that.
00:39  SuperBear: Ok
00:47  Denyerec: Find it now ?
00:47  Denyerec: You need to click on either TS Constants or TS Setup
00:47  Denyerec: depending on where the plugin says you should put the configurationm
00:47  Denyerec: I am sorry I can't help more specifically I am in a bit of a hurry :(
00:47  LayneObserdia: setup i think, couse he wrote page.tx_extkey_pluginname

10:41  iaj: hello there:)
10:41  iaj: if I only got ftp access to a server.. how would I typically install typo there?
10:46  Denyerek: iaj - I don't think that's possible...
10:46  Denyerek: Well
10:47  Denyerek: you can do it if you know what you're doing, as you have to put things in different folders so that you can work around not having symlinks.
10:48  ws_anders: avast ye, me hearties
10:48  ws_anders: any experts on the inner workings of IRRE in flexforms present? :)
10:49  ws_anders: specifically, I keep getting an "Wrong configuration in table tt_content"-error, and I have no idea why
10:50  ws_anders: I'll just sit here and keep bugging you until someone knows something. ;)
11:16  iaj: Shall I first install typo and then reload the database?
11:23  iaj: I get the error: 'TYPO3 Fatal Error: Extension key "lang" was NOT loaded!' :(
11:46  influenzjaaa: Hello. Im trying to create an online-shop with bank-link payment method. Can somebody recommend any tutorials how to create the handleScript for tt_products?
11:47  influenzjaaa: or is it too much to ask someone to show me this handleScript for example?
12:25  HardPhuck: influenzjaaa: too much :)
12:26  influenzjaaa: well, darn :(
12:31  Denyerek: that's gonna be pretty involved.
12:31  Denyerek: I'm sure if you dangled some $$ you'd get a response though.
12:39  HardPhuck: I agree

19:00 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 0 seconds
19:00  iaj: hey there... plz can someone help me.. typo is running from time to time, but then I get a 'The current username, password or host was not accepted when the connection to the database was attempted to be established!' error... 
19:00  iaj: takes half an hour.. and its working again, what's up there/
19:01  aterriblechaos: iaj: sounds like there issues with the mysql server .. try to increase max clients for the mysql server 
19:01  MarcelT3: iaj: if you can, check the logs of the mysql
19:02  aterriblechaos: Cervera: i dont know, but usually you can use jQuery.noConflict to avoid problems
19:02  iaj: aterriblechaos: where would I increase those?
19:02  iaj: on the konsole for the domain?
19:03  aterriblechaos: yes
19:03  iaj: but this one isn't a typo problem, right?
19:03  iaj: its only a database one.
19:04  aterriblechaos: to be shure you need to check the logs, but the error message points to a db problem
19:06  iaj: its working flawlessly in general.. but then.. i get the errors
19:06  iaj: can I do anything with phpMyAdim?
19:06  iaj: Admin*
19:06  MarcelT3: iaj do you have root access to the server(s) youÂ´re workin on?
19:08  iaj: MarcelT3: nah its just a normal user thing from domainfactory
19:08  iaj: why u asking?
19:09  aterriblechaos: iaj: i dont think that you can do anything with phpmyadmin, its a serve setting
19:09  MarcelT3: if you had root access you could have checked the logs. your problem sounds typical to shared hosting exceeding the number of connections to the mysql.
19:09  iaj: http://pastebin.com/Sjew7F2U
19:09  iaj: hmm, yeah I thought so.
19:12  soee: hi
19:12  iaj: may it be that there are some problems with the database.. eg. that its wrongly set up?!  
19:12  MarcelT3: iaj: not if you have times where it works correct
19:13  Cervera: aterriblechaos : i try it already... where to place this function?
19:15  iaj: MarcelT3: I thought so :\ so a database connection problem
19:16  MarcelT3: yeah, well, have you searched for support at df ?
19:17  soee: hmm, igf i have a custom TS for page title, how can i put it in the very top of the head section ?
19:18  MarcelT3: the only thing that could be made in the localconf is to change to non persistent connection but i think this is not considerable
19:22  MarcelT3: iaj: have you enabled [SYS][sqlDebug] in the localconf? afk
19:27  aterriblechaos: Cervera: you need to make shure that the used accordion works with noconflict.. you set it after including the jquery lib
19:33  iaj: MarcelT3: no :(
19:33  iaj: Im using connect instead of pconnect now - lets see where we get.
19:47  Cervera: thank you aterriblechaos
20:07  Badenser: Hi all. We are currently (still) using the latest 4.2 Typo3 and moved the whole installation to a new box. Since then we have some problem with our pages: The output contains sometimes visible html code (<br /> is replaced by &lt;br /&gt;). After saving the page or cleaning the cache it works again. But after a day or so, the problem appears again. Any ideas ... ?
20:22  anyhow: i
20:22  anyhow: hi
20:22  anyhow: can anyone recommend my a nice ext where a nightclub could register their events?
20:23  anyhow: and events should end up in fe
20:27  anyhow: i am thinking of tt_news
20:28  anyhow: but perhaps there are something better

23:41  speart: How do I refresh an extension once i've changed the files?
23:41  speart: Mine still shows the old results
23:41  speart: but clearing cache doesn't do it

23:57  LayneObserdia: speart: I think you don't have to "refresh" it. clear your browser cache, typo3 cache and perhaps some other caches if you have them. or reinstall the extension. But I don't think that you will need to do this.
23:57  speart: LayneObserdia: weird because i see the code changed on the server, but the same stuff shows up when i access it
23:59  LayneObserdia: speart: The first thing I try in this situation is a die("test"); (in the extension code) to see if there issn't a "bug" in the code, and the changes take place.
