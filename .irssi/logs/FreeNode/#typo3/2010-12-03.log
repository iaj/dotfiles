13:16  FloLeBlanc: which document type does one take for mobile phones?
13:17  FloLeBlanc: I tried : <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.2//EN" "http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-mobile12.dtd">
13:17  FloLeBlanc: , but there's no chance to validate that :)
13:26  anteatersa: anyone know if it's possible to use typoscript conditions inside templavoila
13:26  anteatersa: i.e.. I have setup a checkbox field how do I reference that in a condition?
13:27  FloLeBlanc: you mean if someone checked that box or not?
13:29  anteatersa: yes, checkbox in the same templavoila DS
13:32  anteatersa: in normal template I would use:   [globalVar = {$myCheckbox} = 1]
13:36  FloLeBlanc: sorry no clue
13:49  anteatersa: thanks anyway, will use a mapped attribute instead
13:50  anteatersa: I tihnk templavoila is genius but just so badly documented
13:54  Serpiente: whole typo3 is badly documented
13:55  FloLeBlanc: you are free to write better ones - it's open source :)
13:56  FloLeBlanc: as for the beginning mtb and ftb are not bad in my opinion
13:58  Serpiente: FloLeBlanc: just no time.
13:59  PiMB: guys
13:59  PiMB: I have a problem with tt_products and static_info_tables_de
13:59  PiMB: they don't work ;)
14:00  PiMB: I get the drop down in english, and not in german
14:06  PiMB: anybody?
14:07  anteatersa: PiMB: frontend or backend?
14:07  PiMB: frontend
14:07  PiMB: dropdown of country selector
14:07  PiMB: is displayed in english
14:12  anteatersa: is it a multi language site?
14:13  anteatersa: have you set default language i.e. config.language = de
14:14 --- adamcasto is now known as acasto
14:41  PiMB: all did that yeah
14:41  PiMB: and set the config of static tables also to DE
14:41  PiMB: etd.
14:43  Serpiente: checked the language of the user? it might differ from the default language after you changed the default language
15:11  HardPhuck: can i set that footerData comes before includeJSFooter_
15:12  PiMB: Serpiente, yeah I did
15:12  PiMB: the rest of the form is displayed in german
15:12  HardPhuck: because i cant load google hosted jquery with includeJSFooter
15:53  deiga: does anybody have instructions on how to install typo3 with tomcat?
16:05  xaver: hi
16:05  xaver: i have a problem
16:06  xaver: by a update from 4.x to 4.4.4 i add a picture element but cant select cols....
16:29  FloLeBlanc: cya all
17:02  freund: I am using pi_getPageLink in my php extension and want to link to a page with type=2. Providing "type" in the urlParameters doesn't work when using real-url. Does anybody have an idea how to do?
18:36  Guschtel: is there a way to restrict certain pages to a specific IP-Range?
18:36  Guschtel: (without using typoscript, if possible)
18:36  dokma: Guschtel: which methods do you accept?
18:37  Guschtel: extensions or so
18:38  dokma: don't know any
18:38  Guschtel: optimal would be a field (or several) in the backend properties of the page, to specify an ip-range
18:38  dokma: why do you need this?
18:38  Guschtel: to restrict pages to an ip range?
18:39  dokma: why do you need that?
18:39  Guschtel: needs to be accessible only within companies ip ranges
18:39  dokma: what's wrong with a login access only?
18:39  Guschtel: the login
18:41  dokma: how about automatic fe login by ip?
18:41  Guschtel: that would be the last option
18:41  dokma: that one is available
18:42  Guschtel: how?
18:42  dokma: cc_iplogin_be
18:43  dokma: cc_iplogin_fe
19:45  HardPhuck: can i show contents of html file if some condition is met in typoscript?
19:46  dokma: I believe you should be able to do that
19:47  dokma: at least you can call a plugin from ts under some condition
19:47  dokma: that plugin could then read the file and output it
19:47  dokma: 15 minutes of work with kickstarter if no other way is available
19:56  HardPhuck: yeah but i don't wanna write a plugin just to discover it can be done out of the box

In the old we used gif images for e-mail, internal- and external links. on the new page there are no images for any type of link. anyone an idea how to get rid of all this icons in the text. I don't want to do this manually for hundred of links
