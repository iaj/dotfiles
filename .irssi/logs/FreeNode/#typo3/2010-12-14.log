14:34  Nugae: hi. how to integrate free_cap with extbase extension?
14:35  hawkeye78_: i am looking for an extension maybe you can help me...exists a record browser for the backend so i have the chance to browse in some tables of the typo3-DB
14:36  hawkeye78_: because i have create a extension by the kickstarter extension and my boss don't like the backend gui for the administration of the data
14:37  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: the list view does nothing then show you database data. Everything else would be phpmyadmin
14:37  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: or you have to build something for the frontend to add data
14:38  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: i think there isn't something easier than the list view
14:38  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: ohh, maybe do it with ->
14:38  hawkeye78_: snoy_ms, no it should work in the backend, maybe i should explain our situation at the moment we have 3 Tables, one for the statt member one for publications and one which connect both
14:39  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: User Task Center ? This could be something for Users
14:39  hawkeye78_: and my boss don't like the way to edit the publications in the list view for example he would like to have 2 coloums like title and year
14:39  jananne: hello, i want tt_news items ordering specified by the BE-user. so when the BE-user puts a surten news-item at the top, this item wil be displayed in the top when showing the news. so not specified by date or so, but just what he puts on top. is there some extensions or so for this?

15:29  hawkeye78_: i have a little question can i create a task with a sql-query? and if the answer is yes, how? because in the task center i only can export the data
15:29  hawkeye78_: or i am just blind?
15:35  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: ?
15:36  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: you add  new task's on root via listview (type = sql)
15:36  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: thats it...
15:37  hawkeye78_: than i am completly blind
15:38  hawkeye78_: i am on the list view and create a new page, and after this?
15:39  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: go to the root (world)
15:39  hawkeye78_: ok
15:42  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: add new (Task (German: Befehl)
15:42  hawkeye78_: i am
15:42  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: then change the type like you need it...
15:42  hawkeye78_: is the Typo3 Icon = world?
15:42  hawkeye78_: because i didn't see a option to add a task
15:42  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: yes, where you also add users
15:42  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: not the root-page, just the root
15:43  hawkeye78_: :(
15:44  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: did you install the sysextensions? taskcenter ?
15:45  hawkeye78_: taskcenter yes
15:46  hawkeye78_: here is something call sys_note
15:46  hawkeye78_: this one?
15:49  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: typo3 version ?
15:50  hawkeye78_: 4.4.2
15:54  HardPhuck: strange, when im logged out of a site i get blank screen and localconf not found! error
15:54  HardPhuck: but if i log in the BE the FE works fine
15:54  HardPhuck: wtf
15:54  soee: any idea why i cant set sender name in powermail ? when mail is sent to sender as author there is "powermail" :<
15:54  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: ok, in 4.4.x its different...have to find it
15:54  hawkeye78_: ok, for one long moment i was thinking i just to stupid to find the right entry
15:56  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: install the sysext "sys_action"
15:56  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: it isn't installed out of the box..
15:56  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: after that, you can add "actions" to the root
15:57  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: after you add a new action, go to user -> tasks and try to use that
15:58  hawkeye78_: ok i will try
15:58  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: i testet it just some second ago with a 4.4.4, works for me
15:58  hawkeye78_: maybe i am relly to stupid to use it, who know it?
15:59  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: by the way, update your typo3 core...lol
15:59  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: nooo, you just have to know it.
15:59  hawkeye78_: its just the test environment
15:59  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: i also needed a day to find it.....
16:00  hawkeye78_: i find it *yeah
16:00  hawkeye78_: and it works :)
16:00  hawkeye78_: thank you so much :)
16:00  snoy_ms: no problem. There are some nice types, like new record and and and..
16:01  hawkeye78_: but i have one last question
16:01 --- dkords is now known as truedat101
16:01  hawkeye78_: how can i define the sql statement?
16:01  hawkeye78_: there is just a field for title and description
16:01  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: maybe the "new record" is better?
16:02  hawkeye78_: it's the same
16:02  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: never used the sql thing
16:02  snoy_ms: scroll down
16:02  snoy_ms: when you changed to new record
16:03  hawkeye78_: there is nothing to scroll :)
16:03  snoy_ms: type=new record
16:03  snoy_ms: Titel, Description, Groupe.....and scroll down
16:03  hawkeye78_: ah!
16:03  hawkeye78_: my mistace
16:03  snoy_ms: ahhh
16:03  hawkeye78_: sorry
16:04  snoy_ms: but sql query you have to check the docs
16:05  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: alot of admins used that to give other admins a kind of backend-user-controll
16:05  hawkeye78_: ok, i think i didn't need it because i only need a better list of one table
16:05  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: Maybe a Useradmin
16:05  hawkeye78_: and there is a option of list table
16:06  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: in the end you they have to work with typo3. Most of the people are to lazy to learn new stuff.
16:07  snoy_ms: and the typical excuse is "its to complicate"
16:07  hawkeye78_: i have no problems to learn something new, but something i am thing i am just to stupid to use the knowledge on the right way
16:07  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: no, i mean your boss
16:08  snoy_ms: you told me that he thinks the list view isn't nice enough....thats what i meant ;-)
16:08  hawkeye78_: if i say here what i am thinking about my boss i need a new job
16:09  snoy_ms: that why i can it....muahhrr
16:09  hawkeye78_: lol
16:09  hawkeye78_: good point
16:09  snoy_ms: just a joke
16:10  hawkeye78_: but you are right
16:10  snoy_ms: i hope you can use the taskcenter. I think there is no alternative.
16:11  hawkeye78_: i hope too, because its my last working day for this year
16:11  hawkeye78_: and i hate it, to start with the same problem in the new year
16:22  hawkeye78_: snoy_ms, for a sql query as a task you have to create the sql statement under DB check -> full search -> advanced search
16:24  snoy_ms: hawkeye78_: ahh, ok
