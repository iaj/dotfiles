00:28  pascalj: Denyerec: yeah, hooks work. so does windows, nuclear power, dictatorships, child labor and SMTP  ;-)
00:28  Denyerec: Surprised not to see capitalism on that list...
00:28  Denyerec: :)
00:28  Denyerec: I'm not advanced enough to need more than hooks I guess.
00:29  pascalj: heh, thought of that, too
00:29  Denyerec: Do you have a link to a concise explaination of the pattern ?
00:29  Denyerec: (A good explaination)
00:29  pascalj: but honestly: storing a file path and a classname in a global array...?! that can't be it
00:29  pascalj: yeah: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern
00:30  pascalj: there are several refinements: http://stevenblack.com/HooksAndAnchorsDesignPattern.html

11:15  ivaldi: i need someone that knows how workspaces work - if i add a new record in a workspace, it works fine (only is in the worlspace), but if i delete a record in the workspace, it is gone in the live-workspace, too !?
11:16  ivaldi: i would exepct no change in the live-workspace!
11:16  sorenmalling: is there a register : SOMETHING, which contains the data for current tt_content element? or in what way can I retreive these data, when .current = 1 doesn't return the tt_content data?
11:18  sorenmalling: ivaldi: I can't help you with the workspace issue, but if you don't get any response here, try the dedicated workspace maillist: http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-team-workspace
11:19  ivaldi: thx,i have already add the list to my news-reader ;)
11:20  ivaldi: +ed
11:21  sorenmalling: :D
12:16  kraftb: hello ...
12:17  Serpiente: hello
12:31  Denyerek: Hai!
12:36  sorenmalling: is there a register : SOMETHING, which contains the data for current tt_content element? or in what way can I retreive these data, when .current = 1 doesn't return the tt_content data?
12:37  HardPhuck: what do you want to achieve
12:38  sorenmalling: Get the header of the current tt_content element, i need it inside the calendar base plugin

13:53  FloLeBlanc: hi all
14:22  neoneye: is there a guide how to upgrade from 4.1.2 to 4.1.15?
14:22  neoneye: (I want to upgrade it to 4.3.x)
14:23  neoneye: is the procedure like this: unzip the typo3_src and change the typo3_src link to point at it
14:24  HardPhuck: yes
14:24  neoneye: the go into the installtool and apply updates
14:24  HardPhuck: http://wiki.typo3.org/Upgrade
14:25  neoneye: it only describes how to upgrade between major and minor versions... not patch upgrades
14:25  neoneye: or am I missing something?
14:26  neoneye: the guide is pretty good though
14:26  HardPhuck: if you need patch then just point typo3_src to new source and that's it
14:27  neoneye: oha
14:27  neoneye: that's surprisingly nice
14:27  neoneye: great
14:43  Denyerek: new quickstart tutorials are great.
14:45  drowouw: hi people
14:46  drowouw: concerning extension DAM,.. can anyone tell me when the table tx_dam_mm_ref is filled?
15:04  pharno: someone an Idea why the timestamp is showing up?
15:04  pharno: only happens in ruski
15:08  pharno: *unix-timestamp *russian
15:14  sorenmalling: pharno: What timestamp? Where?
15:18  pharno: sorenmalling: http://dirk-naumann.wmcweb03.wmc.ch/uebersicht/
15:18  pharno: look at the time right
15:18  pharno: now klick on the russian flag
15:19  pharno: and look at the time again
15:19  sorenmalling: Maybe something about the way your format it for the certain language?
15:20  MyGoddess: pharno, wath is your typoscript strftime / date format?
15:25  pharno: well, I havent written something for german, so I guess it should be formated? or am I wrong?
15:27  Conic: hi all, is someone here already working with extBase?
15:27  dokma: Hey guyz, I had to disable caching completely on www.magnuscash.com in order to get the login box in the uper left to behave correctly. Has anyone seens an article or something that explains how to mix this properly with caching???
15:28  sorenmalling: dokma: You can set the login plugin as USER_INT to avoid caching, then you don't have to disable cache on the whole page
15:28  sorenmalling: Conic: yes
15:28  dokma: Denyerek, HardPhuck, kraftb, LordLamer, maholtz|WORK, Provito, ries, sorenmalling, void : ^^^^^^
15:29  sorenmalling: dokma: ^^^^^^^^^:)
15:29  sorenmalling: :) 
15:29  dokma: sorenmalling: hmmm... isn't felogin user_int already??
15:29  Conic: was that the answer to me? ^^
15:30  sorenmalling: Conic: The "yes" answer was :)
15:31  Conic: is extbase already able to handle backend extensions?
15:31  Conic: or extensions that also include new backend modules
15:32  sorenmalling: In theory yes :) there are some viewhelpers to help you with the output and if you take a look at EXT:workspaces it's built upon extbase 
15:32  Conic: because it sounded to me like focusing only on fe extensions yet
15:32  Conic: but then i was wrong, that's good ,)
15:34  Conic: so extbase is not in some kind of beta status anymore and i don't have to be scared of things i can't do with it yet?
15:35  sorenmalling: There will be limits when you reach something that extbase is not ment to do or isn't implemented yet, but I take as a good sign that a sysext like workspaces is built upon extbase
15:35  sorenmalling: and at work we are using extbase in production mode
15:36  Conic: how do i happen to know what extbase is NOT for? ^^
15:36  Conic: i have the book "Zukunftssichere Typo3 Extensions mit Extbase & Fluid" in front of me and it doesn't say something about that afaik
15:40  sorenmalling: Conic: It's for almost everything :) (data in and out of TYPO3) in general, it's hard to say when you will hit a limit, because that depends on the work you are going to perform
15:52  kraftb: dokma: I would give the following a try
15:53  kraftb: create a page called login or so, and set the action="" attribute of the login box to this page.
15:53  kraftb: then generate a <input type="hidden" ...> field in the loginbox which contains the URL of the currently viewed page (+ any additional parameters)
15:53  HardPhuck: dokma are you using the felogin from sysext?
15:54  dokma: HardPhuck: yeah... felogin
15:54  kraftb: the login page is responsible for doing the login and should be non-cached, and should finally redirect to the page you came from
15:54  kraftb: I am not completly sure ...
15:54  dokma: kraftb: that sounds good
15:54  kraftb: but it is possible the login get's recognized in any case ... even without such a special setup
15:55  kraftb: you can always log-in a TYPO3 FE by adding the parameters &user=&pass=&pid=&logintype=login to the URL
15:55  kraftb: try if this works while having caching disabled (just to see the URL is correct), and when you are sure it works try to reenable caching
15:57  kraftb: hmm ... strange kind of website you are doing ... this magnuscash
15:57  kraftb: sounds like some kind of pyramide system
15:58  HardPhuck: and the background image is copyrighted :)
16:03  kraftb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme
16:03  kraftb: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneeballsystem
16:06  kraftb: but this is the one I know: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Kings_Club
16:06  kraftb: (in german) ... my mother invested in them in about '91 or '92 and lost quite a few thousand schilling/euros
16:09  MyGoddess: pharno, what is generating the date?
16:10  kraftb: Hello ... I have a question - probably related to TYPO§: How can I generate money?
16:10  kraftb: :) :)
16:10  kraftb: §=3
16:12  randomresult: kraftb: well send me 5000 Euros and invite 10 others to do so too... 
16:12  randomresult: then u will get tonns of euros next week 
16:12  randomresult: for sure 
16:13  kraftb: .dataWrap = {field:moenyToRandomresult}*10
16:13  kraftb: .prioriCalc = intval
16:13  kraftb: ?
16:14  randomresult: now enter ur bankaccount and i send u my western union ID
16:14  kotelette: Hi! Could anyone help me how to change the path of the fe_typo_user cookie to "/"
16:14  kotelette: it's always set to the subdirectory on my installation :-(
16:17  Idar: Hi,How can I get THE typolink object to generate htmlSpecialChars from title? MY title is called "Disclaimer & Privacy", but i want it to generate the "&amp;" 
16:18  Idar: lib.footer.30 = TEXT   lib.footer.30.wrap = |  lib.footer.30.typolink { parameter = 217  ATagParams=rel="nofollow" }
16:20  Idar: lib.footer.30.htmlSpecialChars = 1 , lib.footer.30.stdWrap.htmlSpecialChars = 1, lib.footer.30.wrap.htmlSpecialChars = 1, lib.footer.30.stdWrap.wrap.htmlSpecialChars = 1, lib.footer.30.typolink.htmlSpecialChars = 1, lib.footer.30.typolink.stdWrap.htmlSpecialChars = 1 doesn't work
16:21  MyGoddess: Idar, the typolink function is loading the title automatically because there is no content.
16:22  MyGoddess: You must explicitly load it with data = page:title in order to process it before adding the typolink.
16:45  ThomasMW: hi all
16:45  ThomasMW: does anyone here has experience with CHC_Forum?
16:45  ThomasMW: *have
16:53  pharno: If I have a website with multiple languages. What about the impressum?
16:54  pharno: Do I have to write one for each language?
