09:32  _ramo: HardPhuck: is there any ressource where this is described with an example?
09:33  HardPhuck: yes, the book i've told you about
09:33 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 111 seconds
09:37  sorenmalling: _ramo: I guess HardPhuck is referring to the great book "TYPO3 Extension Development" by Dmitry?! You should buy that book anyway, it's a great help in extension development!
09:37  sorenmalling: Ingo Renner wrote a article about adding a new plugin to your extension, find it here: http://www.ingo-renner.com/index.php?id=20
09:38  _ramo: sorenmalling: yes, he refers exactly to that book
09:38  _ramo: thank you for the link!
09:38  sorenmalling: Where as that article only covers that single subject, the book covers alot of different areas and makes it clear how you can integrate all the setting and functions in to your own extension
09:38  iaj: morning
09:39  iaj: is there any way to be able to select a text in the RTE and assign <div class="foo> </div> arround it by using the block style or something?
09:40  iaj: I just can't seem to get that to work.. took me 3 hrs yesterday... :(
09:42  soee: guys can i display 2 LIST views of tt_news on the same page?
09:42  HardPhuck: soee yes you can
09:42  HardPhuck: as many as you want
09:43  soee: HardPhuck: now i have "no news in this list" message on the second one that is placed in side panel, in single view it works
09:43  HardPhuck: it means you didn't configure the plugin properly
09:44  HardPhuck: or you don't have any news where it's trying to fetch them from
09:45  iaj: no one uses that important flags or whatever?
09:45  HardPhuck: iaj did you check htmlarea documentation?
09:45  soee: HardPhuck: but its the same content element on all subpages, and it works everywhere except the page wit second list view :/
09:47  iaj: HardPhuck: oh..yeah.. I did.... well and I searched google - tried different approachs
09:47  HardPhuck: iaj: try typo3.net forum
09:47  iaj: afaik, its only the allowTags...in RTE.default.proc ..  and allowedClasses
09:47  iaj: HardPhuck: did you ever manage to set it up?
09:48  HardPhuck: divs no, because divs don't belong in content :)
09:49  iaj: can you use another TAG as kinda, well a box surrounding the stuff? that you can give a height?
09:53  iaj: HardPhuck: you had it working on 4.4.5 as well
09:53  HardPhuck: iaj, you can add class important for example (built in)
09:54  HardPhuck: and you can then style that span
09:54  HardPhuck: that would be the easiest and fastest way
09:57  Denyerek: Mornin all
09:57  sorenmalling: Morning Denyerek 
09:58  HardPhuck: hey Den
10:00  iaj: HardPhuck: yeah well, when I add the important span to.. and then... save... the <SPAN> goes away
10:00  iaj: it just isn't saved, whatever I try :\
10:00  HardPhuck: iaj open the folder typo3/sysext/rtehtmlarea/res/
10:01  HardPhuck: and see how RTE is configured
10:02  tsajuk: iaj: does your <SPAN> have attributes? SPANs without attributes are removed by default
10:02  iaj: hmmm... HardPhuck any particular?? thought it was proc/
10:02  iaj: tsajuk: yeah.. the important class tags are removed as well
10:02  HardPhuck: pageTSconfig in folder 'typical' might be a good start
10:03  HardPhuck: do you have an up-to-date version of htmlarea
10:03  HardPhuck: and T3 in general?
10:03  iaj: 4.4.5 T3... and so I think htmlarea as well
10:05  HardPhuck: ok should work then
10:05  Denyerek: Typo 4.5 looks pretty special
10:05  HardPhuck: Denyerek: how so
10:05  soee: HardPhuck: heh i didnt set excludeAlreadyDisplayedNews=0 and thats why second list wans empty -.-
10:05  Denyerek: The usability changes and speedups to the backend mainly
10:06  Denyerek: Be nice to work with the new tree and uploader
10:09 --- Nirvan_ is now known as Nirvan
10:09  tsajuk: iaJ: you will need to allow your userdefined classes that you use in your SPAN tag. It seems that your classes are not in the allowed classes list and therefore deleted. Then ths SPAN tag is deleted as the class attribute is empty  :D 
10:18  soee: is it possible to pun into tt_news template current date ?
10:18  soee: *put
10:18  iaj: tsajuk: hmmmm... i tried that again... w8 a sec.
10:33  iaj: ... my root PageTS Config: http://pastebin.com/eCqbh2ge
10:34  iaj: proc.allowedClasses defined... allowTags contains span....  its driving me mad :O
10:47  MateMK4: Hm... I would like to have a final html like: <a href="index.php?id=5">Menu_item</a>.
10:47  MateMK4: Is it possible to achieve this with TV, by only one click to the appropriate menu item. E.g. like link field, just that it would also insert the Menu_item text between the a tags?
10:47  tsajuk: iaj: where do the SPAN tags disappear: in the input field or in the database? which class names are you using?  --- But wait: you didn't specify the "RTE.default.contentCSS" file. add your user css classes ther and it should be o.k.
10:57  iaj: hmmm after saving they disappear, tsajuk im gonna try the contentCSS - but isn't that just for the RTE display??

11:04 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
11:10  iaj: btw which browser/version is most recommendable for typo3 editing?
11:13  No5251: iaj: the BE should work with every modern browser
11:14  _ramo: where is the entry-point of an extension/plugin? for example an frontendplugin. is there a entry point per definition or does this depent of the plugin type?
11:14  soee: any idea why translations doesnt work for powermail? all forms are using default language but not the one that is set for page
11:17  tsajuk: iaj: Chrome/Canary is very good  due to high JS speed but you still have to use Opera to use htmlareaRTE  :( . Don't like FF as it eats up all your RAM immediately - even if you have 12 GB
11:18  iaj: when is the new firefox js engine about to come out/
11:18  iaj: :-)
11:20  DerSchreiner: iaj: if you use Opera, you might want to check your Javascript settings to allow capturing right clicks
11:22  iaj: DerSchreiner: I don't like opera that much, I prefer Chrome...
11:22  iaj: htmlareRTE... huh.. which part actually is that one describing??
11:22  iaj: htmlareaRTE..
11:24  No5251: soee: powermail element is translated?
11:26  soee: No5251: im saying about texts from locallang file, there is polish version wich is my default page language but all the texts are displayed in english
11:27  neoneye: how much memory is require($BACK_PATH.'init.php'); supposed to take up?  I'm experiencing memory growth of ~21 Mbytes.. can this be true?
11:32  No5251: soee: t3 with templavoila?
11:32  fr34k: hey guys... can I get access on a marker with ts?
11:32  soee: No5251: yes
11:40  iaj: tsajuk: hmmm i tried... the default.contentCSS only refers to the current RTE view? when I save all gets lost.. and I needed dynamiccss to install
11:47  iaj: and another thing I think I asked here before.. someone using VIM for TYPO editing
11:50  HardPhuck: yes
11:51  iaj: HardPhuck: hm, do you have a working indent script? 
11:52  HardPhuck: no i use =
11:52  HardPhuck: usually works
11:53  iaj: so you got no specific typo syntax/indent files?
11:53  HardPhuck: what files?
11:54  iaj: well.. in order to have typoscript syntax highlighting :)
11:54  HardPhuck: i don't edit typoscript with VIM
11:55  iaj: ooohhhh.... :s
11:55  iaj: ok
12:05  Denyerek: Hmm
12:05  Denyerek: weird
12:05  Denyerek: I have a site where the homepage takes 60 seconds to load.
12:05  Denyerek: Every time.
12:05  Denyerek: analysing the net panel in FFox, there's a 1ms request
12:05  Denyerek: then a 60s wait
12:05  Denyerek: then a 32m response
12:06  Denyerek: Anyone got the faintest idea where to start looking for the cause?
12:06  Denyerek: It's 60s on multiple machines too
12:09  HardPhuck: the machine is out of ram and php then has to write to disk
12:11  soee: ;o
12:11  soee: ;o
12:11  Denyerek: very, very possible
12:12  Denyerek: What would be the most bulletproof way to verify this?
12:12  Denyerek: (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS)
12:12  HardPhuck: can you log in via ssh?
12:12  Denyerek: Yep
12:13  HardPhuck: free -m
12:14  Denyerek: Will pastecode results whilst page is reloading
12:14  HardPhuck: check how much Mem is free and how much Swap is used
12:14  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/jake0ZKn
12:14  HardPhuck: lol
12:14  HardPhuck: 245MB ram total?
12:14  HardPhuck: generous
12:14  Denyerek: Cloud machine ;)
12:15  Denyerek: Only provisioned the minimum to begin with
12:15  Denyerek: But the free numbers don't indicate a lot of swapping / memory use ?
12:15  HardPhuck: how can you expect it work with apache plus all the modules plus mysql
12:15  HardPhuck: no wonder
12:15  HardPhuck: here's your problem
12:15  Denyerek: when I look at "top", apache appears briefly, then vanishes for 60 seconds, then appears briefly again.
12:16  Denyerek: Surely 256mb RAM is enough to serve a single static site?
12:16  HardPhuck: is it a typo3 site?
12:16  Denyerek: How on earth did people manage 10 years ago I wonder... :)
12:16  Denyerek: Not yet... :)
12:16  HardPhuck: html only?
12:17  Denyerek: With some basic reads from a DB
12:17  Denyerek: IE, reading a single content field kinda thing.
12:17  Denyerek: nothing complex at all.
12:17  HardPhuck: then your apache is misconfigured
12:17  Denyerek: and what's weird is the 60 seconds.
12:17  Denyerek: always *exactly* 60 seconds on any page
12:17  Denyerek: 1ms request, 60s delay, 30-80ms response
12:18  Denyerek: I'll try in #apache, but if they're anything like the nasty people in #php I'll be back soon with a sore ear :(
12:21  HardPhuck: Denyerek: just google how to optimize apache
12:21  HardPhuck: and with 245RAM you might wanna add 2 workers tops
12:21  HardPhuck: 40-60MB per worker
12:22  HardPhuck: bbs lunch time
12:29  iaj: weird... I just cannot get that additonal classes to work
12:38  soee: argh next problem, i have checkbox mandatory field in my powermail form but even if its checked on the validation page there is error that this field must be filled, any idea how can i fix this ?
12:55  ivaldi: is it possible to use frontend editing with workspaces in typo3 4.4.x ?
12:58  MateMK4: Is there a way to simpy verify all the elements in the TV after the template file has been changed? Or do I have to go through each one of 9 FCEs?
13:01  MarcelT3: lo
13:03  No5251: has somebody experience with typo3 at jiffybox?
13:18  HardPhuck: Denyerek: if you have a small site I can host it for you
13:33  soee: if i insert image with link inside thxn template for powermail this tags are stripped it seams, any idea where can i turn it off ?
13:46 --- _ramo1 is now known as _ramo
13:47  sorenmalling: Anyone here tried out "Translation handling" in the new extension manager?
14:31  WrYBiT: back
14:40 --- nej_ is now known as nej
14:44 --- pschriner is now known as _DerSchreiner
14:53  iaj: did someone manage to add custom classes by using the RTE to a currently edited p tag by adding a   span class="..." to it AND have it saved?
15:00  soee: imm trying to use jfmulticontent but when i insert plugin on my page i have this error in console: jQuery("#jfmulticontent_c38").accordion is not a function 
15:01  soee: any idea how solve it ?
15:02  sorenmalling: soee: Did you include the jquery javascript library?
15:02  soee: yup
15:03  sorenmalling: And you got a dom with id jfmulticontent_c38??
15:03  soee: ah sorry, i didnt include Accordion in js lib
15:03  soee: it works now
15:08  Denyerek: If a directory is listed as :    root:www-data rwxrwxr-x
15:09  Denyerek: If I specify g+s on it, will all files within be created in the www-data group ?
15:09  Denyerek: I'm not quite sure I get the "sticky" flag :/
15:33  iaj: whats the best way to outsorce the PAGETS config from the rootpage?
15:35  iaj: outsource* sorry
15:39  MarcelT3: try <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE: fileadmin/templates/ts/pagets.txt"> it works for setup/constants it may work for pageTS, too
15:40  iaj: Omy.. using dynamiccss.. its showing me them classes in the RTE... I chose them.. it renders correctly.. (with p class="foobar")... and then when I hit save
15:40  iaj: it gets lost
15:40  iaj: Why oh Why.......
15:41  iaj: that rteHTMLareaentry - what am I missing :(
15:41  iaj: MarcelT3: thanks... ill try :)
15:50  iaj: MarcelT3: worked.. thanks :)
15:51  MarcelT3: np, i´ll save it for a project where i´d want to outsource that as well.
15:52  iaj: easier texting now.. that damn problem.... ;(
16:02  iaj: ...solved :-))
16:51  iaj: hmm where can I specify the title of H1 H2 H3 in RTE dropdown list?
16:51  iaj: oh and someone know what's wrong about using: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/320046
16:58  iaj: Oh - and sorry for bugging but what would be the best 'blogging' solution for a TYPO based site?
17:12  chatzilla: hi
17:12  chatzilla: is it possible to leave out the a-tag in a TMenu?
17:12  chatzilla: and use the url otherwise
17:15  ries: chatzilla: can you give an example of that, eg what are you trying to do with that URL
17:16  chatzilla: well, actually i want the submenu to be inside the <a>-tag, like this: http://pastebin.com/s1BXkEG8
17:16  chatzilla: i know this is very dirty code
17:16  chatzilla: but i need it so that it works in internet explorer 6
17:17  chatzilla: the thing inside the table is the submenu
17:17  chatzilla: the way it is now, the a tag wraps the "Menüpunkt 1" thing and the table is below that
17:17  chatzilla: but i need the a tag to wrap the whole thing
17:24  chatzilla: did you understand what i mean and just don't know how to do it, or am i not making any sense? :D
17:26  snoy_ms: iaj: some people are using the timtab extension. But i would prefere wordpress for blogging
17:29  ries: chatzilla: I don't support IE6
17:29  ries: and that HTML you are showing is horribly...
17:29  chatzilla: i don't do as well normally, but my boss told me to :-/
17:29  chatzilla: but i think i found a way with donotlinkit
17:29  ries: chatzilla: tell him to go home and re.consider
17:29  ries: and yo are not allowed to put block level elements in inline elements anyways
17:31  iaj: snoy_ms: is that wordpress easy to install on the server?
17:33  Sebastian2: can someone help me and tell me how to do bugsearching when you only get a white page?
17:33  snoy_ms: iaj: its realy easy, if you use default config (php/mysql). There are also alot of templates out there....
17:34  iaj: snoy_ms: hmm so first of all I'd need root access to my server.. correct?
17:34  Sebastian2: I created a extension that extends simulatestatic with multilanguagesupport. It hooks on the normal extension and changes functions. it worked till I found that I need to take care of the settings for shortcuts too. so I  changed a bit and want to test.
17:35  snoy_ms: iaj: wordpress is an own 'web app'. You have to check out wordpress.org
17:35  snoy_ms: iaj: you need some ftp and mysql access
17:35  Sebastian2: but now the page only loads for maybe 60 seconds and then I get a clean white page. no errors or somewhat. I dont know why that is. In mysql there arent queries so its not hanging there. I simply cant find the error...
17:36  snoy_ms: Sebastian2: only white page? Maybe you should enable errors in php.ini
17:36  Sebastian2: I thought maybe there happens a redirect after all erros were painted... so I went into original sysext and commented out the redirect. clear cache but no effect...
17:37  Sebastian2: snoy_ms: yes only a white page. errors should be enabled with ini_set('display_errors','On');
17:37  snoy_ms: Sebastian2: yes
17:39  Sebastian2: Im sitting here and testing whats the problem but whithout a clue it seems to be impossible... I think it is timing out... but I dont see why that should be. I created some extra queries but when I look in process list in mysql there are no running queries. That shouldnt be the problem...
17:59  iaj: hmmmm someone knows how to change the titles for h1,h2,h3 in RTEhtmlarea ? :\
18:28  ries: Anybody knows a good plugin for Chrome to real-time edit CSS
18:31  chatzilla: with datawrap in a tmenu i can insert the link title with {field:title}, the id with {field:id}, etc.; How  can I insert the URL?
19:04  iaj: hmm I'm adding a span class="foobar" too a bit of text.. however.. when I save.. its not saved :( what am I missing?
19:06 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
19:27  iaj: nobody ever crossed that problem:)
20:19  iaj: my p classes are saved perfectly, why oh why does it drop the p.span class="foo"  span tags completely.. plz.. this drives me mad
