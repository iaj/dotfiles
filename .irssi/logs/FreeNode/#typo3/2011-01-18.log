00:00  speart: LayneObserdia: i guess i could try something like that. It's not coming up blank or with errors, it's just not changing from what it was before...
00:02  LayneObserdia: speart: Hm, sry no idea. But you can try to clear the cache only for the specific page (the lower blizzard when you're on the page in the be.) Or try CTRL+SHIFT+R in Firefox or Google Chrome when you're on the fe-page. That can help.
00:03  speart: LayneObserdia: But the real thing is that there isn't some special way to "refresh" an extension?
00:04  LayneObserdia: speart: If there is a way. I don't know it. The only way I know to refresh an extension is to reinstall it.
00:04  speart: LayneObserdia: ok fair enough, ill poke at it
00:09  LayneObserdia: speart: Did it help?
00:09  speart: LayneObserdia: no unfortunately it didn't

The files do not need to be imported, just downloaded from a secure area for each user. Are there any docs or modules I should check out?

11:45  iaj: hmm, one shouldn't use an external database (on another server) when running a typo3 site, I suppose?
11:45  MarcelT3: iaj:  why not?
11:46  Allah_Waleoo: yes I get only those which i have selected from table list but i need only those which are not hidden record
11:46  Allah_Waleoo: this csv generate both hidden=1 and hidden=0
11:48  MarcelT3: iaj: the more interesting question is how to secure the communication between db server and web server :]
11:54  iaj: MarcelT3: it seems soo slow :(
11:55  MarcelT3: i know that issue. are you sure it´s the line between db<->web ?
11:59  iaj: MarcelT3: dunno, mb its because we only pay 2$ for the webhosting package
11:59  iaj: we upgraded now..
11:59  iaj: 20$... lets see
12:01  _ramo: hm, that's strange. i've created an extension as an frontend plugin, and integrated it in a single page. now i can only read the header of the extension, but not the default content that's generated fromt he kickstarter in the *_pi1.php file. (the text "this is a few paragraphs:...")
12:01  _ramo: any hints what's going wrong here?
12:02  ndee: anyone knows how I can wrap the whole "SINGLE_RECORDINSERT" part in tt_news?
12:05  aterriblechaos: ndee: is that for insert records? than just use tt_news.stdWrap.wrap=blah|
12:07  ndee: aterriblechaos, jup. Sweet, gonna try it, thanks a lot! :)
12:08  _ramo: aterriblechaos: any ideas what's going wrong in my case?
12:08  ndee: aterriblechaos, hm, the problem is, I selected multiple records and it does the wrap for every article I've selected.
12:10  aterriblechaos: ndee: use a coa, http://pastebin.com/fEcWTumU
12:11  aterriblechaos: _ramo: i dont know ... check if the ext. is included the right way ( allowed in FE, available ts configuration)
12:12  soee: ok, can i do twice override on some value?
12:13  aterriblechaos: soee: why not? override.field=firstfield // secondfield
12:14  ndee: aterriblechaos, hm, it still shows it for every element.
12:14  _ramo: aterriblechaos: i don't know how. i just create the extension with kickstarter, create a new page, and add a plugin... i thought the default content-text from kickstarter should be shown then on the page
12:15  aterriblechaos: ndee: hmm .. i looked into my code, i did a little hack : http://pastebin.com/8jsDvhLa
12:16  soee: aterriblechaos: thank you :D page finished -.-
12:16  aterriblechaos: _ramo: make shure that the extion typoscript is includet!
12:16  aterriblechaos: soee: you own me a beer! xD
12:16  _ramo: aterriblechaos: where to do that?
12:17  soee: np :D just call me when you are in Poland :)
12:17  ndee: aterriblechaos, thanks for the link. I gonna think about it some more :)
12:19  _ramo: okay, now i can see it... but don't ask why
12:19  _ramo: i just switched from one plugin to another and back... now it works...
12:27  _ramo: aterriblechaos: if i do  a $newClass = t3lib_div::makeInstance('tx_globitsto_pi1'); in the class.tx_myext_pi1.php and reload the page, my page leave completely blank this is the code.... http://privatepaste.com/62e21ce56a/afhz3jh45wg the extension i need resided in typo3conf/ext/naw_single_signon/pi1/class.tx........ 
12:27  _ramo: do i need a require_once ?
12:31  Cervera: hello typofans
12:31  aterriblechaos: _ramo: i would try a require_once, yes .. you should check your error.log for hints
12:32  _ramo: aterriblechaos: so a require_once to an aboslute path or relative path? relative to what?
12:37  Cervera: finally got to edit these languageKeys in the locallang.xml, are the country index codes the same used in the backend?
12:38  Cervera: sorry this was a dumb question
12:45  HardPhuck: don't edit locallang files
12:58  Cervera: HardPhuck: Why not? Anyway i found an extension that handles these files
12:59  soee: arg why does wrap doesnt work for TEXT in TV TS ?
12:59  Cervera: HardPhuck: How do i translate the extensions labels then?
13:02  HardPhuck: Cervera in TS because locallang files get overwritten when you update an extension
13:03  Cervera: aaah
13:03  HardPhuck: I have a strange problem... i have domain.com but then i click any link in the menu i get redirected to domain.com0 (notice the 0) and i get 404
13:03  HardPhuck: on all links
13:04  Cervera: HardPhuck: How do ı do that in TS?
13:05  Cervera: HardPhuck: you could try to de-install all extensions one by one until you find the buggy one that appends that 0 to the end of the link
13:06  ndee: anyone knows if there is a separate extension for selecting single tt_news records? the template_single_recordinsert is not great since it takes over the same settings from the normal single-view :/
13:06  HardPhuck: Cervera: tx_plugin_pi1._LOCAL_LANG.de { more = Mehr }
13:07  HardPhuck: for example
13:07  ndee: HardPhuck, do you have the domain record multiple times?
13:08  HardPhuck: no, just checked
13:08  _ramo: if i define a new function in my plugin, do i have to register this function elsewhere?
13:09  HardPhuck: and I have default realURL configuration
13:09  HardPhuck: and if i turn realurl off and enable simulatestaticdocuments i get the same error
13:09  ndee: check directly in the DB if there is another domain record?
13:09  Cervera: HardPhuck: i was just thinking at realurl 
13:09  HardPhuck: ndee: no duplicates
13:09  ndee: HardPhuck, cleared cache?
13:10  Cervera: htaccess rewrite typos?
13:10  HardPhuck: yup, truncated tables
13:14  HardPhuck: Cervera: nah, but i suspect it has something to do with .htaccess
13:17 --- Allah_Waleoo__ is now known as Allah_Waleoo
13:20  HardPhuck: found it
13:20  ndee: what was it?
13:20  HardPhuck: rm typo3conf/temp_CACHED_*
13:20  ndee: :D
13:21  HardPhuck: exit
13:21  HardPhuck: ah
13:25  Azrael_-: ok, creating templates for typo3 is far more difficult compared to joomla....
13:27  soee: huh?
13:27  Cervera: Azrael: thats not true... Templavoila' make templating a breeze
13:28  soee: true, all you have to do is to create simple html + css template -.-
13:28  HardPhuck: it really is more difficult. That's why TYPO3 is an enterprise system, while joomla is garage system
13:45  Azrael_-: HardPhuck: i know, i just didn't expect such a big jump in the needed effort for a template
13:45  Azrael_-: Cervera: thx, i'll have a look into it
13:49  soee: can find solution for my problem: 2 tt_news LISTs on the same page, all works fine until i use pagebrowser and switch to next page on the first list - then the second list is empty
13:49  soee: any idea why?
13:49  soee: *cant
13:50  anteatersa: soee, this is becuase tt_news uses variables in the url to change pages, so when you click next on one it is showing the next page for the other news list as well.... but the other news list doesn't have enough articles
13:51  evilness: guys is there by any chance possibility to make default unchecked box "hidden" when adding a news?
13:51  soee: ok but is there any solution for it ?
13:52  anteatersa: not really, I had the same problem on one of my sites and I used ajax to pull the next page of articles and update
13:53  anteatersa: you can see my solution here: http://www.hbf.co.uk/Media-Centre-Home-Builders-Federation-047fea6
13:53  HardPhuck: soee: maybe there is some ignore setting in tt_news TSref
13:54  soee: anteatersa: it was custom code ?
13:54  MarcelT3: evilness yes you can put this line into the pageTS: TCAdefaults.tt_news.hidden = 0
13:54  soee: HardPhuck: yea ill try to find it
13:54  anteatersa: soee: yes
13:55  soee: anyway maybe LATEST will help here ?
13:55  soee: does LATEST uses the pagebrowser settings ?
13:55  anteatersa: soee: yes
13:58  soee: anteatersa: did you created some smal extension to display news using ajax ?
14:00  anteatersa: no, just wrapped each news box in a div e.g.: <div id="13181" class="content_wrapper"> 
14:01  anteatersa: then using jquery, I grab the next page of results and update, look in my js for a function "ajaxNews"
14:02  anteatersa: then attach ajaxNews function to ttnews-browsebox: $('.tx-ttnews-browsebox a').click(ajaxNews); 
14:09  soee: hmm can i unset some variable using TS?
14:23  soee: anteatersa: it works without ajax 
14:24  soee: anteatersa: LIST + LATEST on the same page works fne
14:34  HardPhuck: guys, i need a suggetsion
14:34  HardPhuck: I have some really old TYPO3 sites
14:34  HardPhuck: they are not dinamic any more :)
14:34  HardPhuck: is there a way i could generate html files for whole tree structure
14:34  HardPhuck: so i could remove T3 out of the equation? :)
14:35  HardPhuck: and the site would still work
14:36  Cervera: HardPhuck: you can spider it with a url grabbing program...
14:36  Cervera: HardPhuck:that will save locally html files only
14:36  MarcelT3: HardPhuck: how about nc_staticfilecache or a cache like varnish? (overkill maybe, but would work)
14:37  MarcelT3: yes, or wget
14:37  soee: is it good practice to split TS code int 2-3 or even 4 templates (1 main template and 3 additional )?
14:37  HardPhuck: yes
14:38  HardPhuck: i create a sysfolder named TS folder, and put several sysfolders in: Page, Config, Navigation, Library, Plugins
14:38  soee: ;o
14:38  MarcelT3: soee: if you manage to rule your whole page with *only* four templates, you´re quite cool :)
14:39  soee: tbh i have 2 templates only
14:39  Azrael_-: one template should be enough :) (for small pages)
14:39  soee: 1 main and second libs
14:39  HardPhuck: and then i put my page object into one sysfolder, my config in another, menus in navigaion and so on ...
14:39  MarcelT3: soee: i guess the page is smaller and newer.
14:39  soee: well i can show you :)
14:40  HardPhuck: separating them makes it easier to debug and update
14:40 --- _ramo1 is now known as _ramo
14:41  MarcelT3: small projects don´t need that many templates imho. but if it grows in functionality you´d better go ways like HardPhuck suggests for maintainability
14:44  soee: well in main template i have page configuration TS + extensions cfgs and in the second one temp. or lib. objects

15:41  iaj_: is someone familiar with powermail??  after I created 5 textfields in a formfield- and add more - it just won't show them on the FE... hwo comes?
15:47  marcuslind: Hi guys, I'm using rgsmoothgallery and I'm having some problems with it. I got a page with a flash-banner. When I open a gallery using rgsmoothgallery my Flashbanner disepears. 
15:48  marcuslind: Either the flash stop showing, or somehow rgsmoothgallery change a z-index somehow on my whole site
15:48  marcuslind: but my site is not position: relative; so I doubt it.
15:52  soee: hmm what do i have to set to allow be user to be able to edit FCE content ?
15:54  _ramo: i don't understand the following scenario: i've installed an extension. this extension calculates a validation time:  like this: http://privatepaste.com/5349e4de82/sfd23fwfwef and retrieve information from the flexform xml file. if i embed this plugin directly into a blank page, and want to playout the time, i get the current time + 1800 seconds and this is the correct result.
15:55  _ramo: if i create a new extension, and include the class from the above extension into the new one, i get only the current time   without the additional 1800 seconds as a result
15:56  _ramo: but why? in the new extension i just do a $newClass->main($content, $conf)
15:57  _ramo: so i invoke the same main function.... $content is empty, and in $conf there are just information about the userFunc
15:59  iaj_: Gnaaa, why won't powermail letme add more stuff to my page :(
15:59  CoreTex_: hi, have anybody a good howto link for me? I'm looking for "Howto extend an extension / overriding an function" or something like this
16:04  iaj_: When I add a new element on Powermail now, [REF] is not set all the time...
16:05  iaj_: Which mailform plugin can you guys recommen?
16:05  _ramo: any ideas for my above issue?
16:22  sorenmalling: _ramo: Does the 1800 come from the $conf array?
16:25  _ramo: sorenmalling: no, the $conf array just has the line with the userFunc->main
16:25  sorenmalling: So the 1800 is hardcoded in the class?
16:25  _ramo: the 1800 are only defined in tthe flexform.xml
16:26  sorenmalling: Arh okay. Did you try to debug the getting of the data? Is it "saved" in a scope of the class?
16:27  _ramo: no i didn't debug it.... i just printed the same line, but accessed it from two pages.... one give the time() +1800 (correct) and the other page returns just time() without 1800.... both invoke the same method, and so the same print_r
16:28  sorenmalling: _ramo: But from this: $newClass->main($content, $conf) it looks like your are invoking it inside som other extension
16:30  _ramo: sorenmalling: yes that's right. and this causes the wrong result at the end. if i access the extension directly, i got the right result. if i access this "external" extension from the new created extesion via $newClass .... i got just the time() without the 1800 seconds...
16:43  sorenmalling: _ramo: Try to debug $this->cObj->data['pi_flexform'], because it don't think you get the flexform values as you expect, as you are starting one plugin (with one "name/extkey/pluginname") inside a nother, with a different identification against the cObj

19:17  _ramo1: what exactly are flexforms in typo3?
19:18  tom_: _ramo1: They allow you to customize the form fields presented in the backend
19:19  _ramo1: tom_: do you have an example... i'm more developing in frontends, less in backends ;)
19:20  tom_: there is something in the wiki: http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/Extension_Development,_using_Flexforms
19:20  tom_: Also in Dimitri's book there is a chapter about flexforms. 
19:20  _ramo1: tom_: ah okay... i'm on page 116 in his book
19:20  tom_: I think - it's been a while :-)
19:21  _ramo1: :)
19:21  _ramo1: thank you anyway!

19:22  _ramo1: how can i identify myself against the cObj?
19:31  _ramo1: ah, tom_ so flexform are forms in forms, something like: a plugin has three configuration tabulators, and each can modify the plugin in it's way and update/save the configuration

20:44  LayneObserdia: depending on the doktypes value you can create different links, external or intern
20:47  conic: ok i'm having a look at it, thanks ;)

21:30  tom_: well, when it comes especially to blogging they have a point, and that's becoming more and more of an issue. I'm just working on project where I integrated a wp blog next to the T3 website.
21:30  tom_: And that was after I tried to convince the customer of t3blog. He at the end wanted to do the updates from his iPhone and I had to throw the towel with T3.
21:31  conic: publishing with an iphone is not what T3 team meant by "enterprise level" :D
21:32  LayneObserdia: There is still an app for tt_news ;) http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/typo3/id328061434?mt=8
21:35  tom_: LayneObserdia: Yeah - I saw the introduction. But the client was already on t3blog and to build an iPhone app for that was too expensive.
21:36  tom_: the advantage with the WP api is that there are applications on several platforms - I have Chocok on Linux for example that allows you to blog remotely on wp. 
21:43  XTREM: hi all
21:44  XTREM: somebody speak spanish?
21:44  LayneObserdia: XTREM: hello
21:44  LayneObserdia: XTREM: not me sry
21:44  XTREM: uhm
21:44  XTREM: I will try speak poor english 
21:46  XTREM: I've started to use Typo3
21:47  XTREM: I am a programmer but do not control any of typo3 TypoScript
21:47  XTREM: well
21:48  XTREM: I can insert php in a block with page_php_content
21:49  XTREM: but, I want to insert php in footer 
21:49  LayneObserdia: I think you do better by using typoscript
21:49  tom_: XTREM: what do you want to do in your footer with php?
21:49  XTREM: well
21:50  XTREM: I use simple dom html
21:51  XTREM: I load a page with simpledom and work on it
21:51  LayneObserdia: we use "extensiontemplates" typoscript templates, extending the typoscript template, using two lines to insert the phpfile: http://wiki.typo3.org/TSref/PHP_SCRIPT
21:52  XTREM: don't work this web
21:52  XTREM: :\
21:53  tom_: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://wiki.typo3.org/TSref/PHP_SCRIPT
21:53  tom_: still cached.
21:53  XTREM: thank
21:53  LayneObserdia: this way, you have to store your output in the variable $content. like ob_start(); $content = ob_get_clean();
21:54  XTREM: I don't understand that I see, wait
21:54  tom_: but chances are that you are better off using typoscript unless you really want to do something very specific. check out http://www.typo3wizard.com/ maybe you find something which suits you
21:55  tom_: XTREM are you getting remote html with simpledom for your footer? Then it probably would make sense I guess.
21:56  XTREM: uhm
21:56  XTREM: i getting index.php?id=123
21:56  XTREM: from typo3
21:57  XTREM: my English is poor and there is little documentation in Spanish
21:58  tom_: u have a link?
21:59  XTREM: for now, with Jquery I "get"a php file that calls
22:00  XTREM: a typo3index.php?id=123 and make ajax in footer
22:01  XTREM: but, I think that isn't correct
22:01  XTREM: i won't do ajax in footer
22:01  XTREM: in typoscript object browser
22:02  XTREM: have a footer = html
22:02  XTREM: footer.20 =<div id="footer">
22:03  tom_: that doesn't make sense. footer.20 doesn't exist yet. you woudl have to declare a footer=COA; footer.20 = TEXT; footer.20.value = this or that
22:03  XTREM: yes
22:04  XTREM: i have this code, 
22:04  XTREM: footer > footer = COA footer {    9 = TEXT    9.value =<div id="footer"> }
22:05  LayneObserdia: 10 = PHP_SCRIPT
22:05  LayneObserdia: 10.file = fileadmin/php/yourscript.php
22:05  XTREM: LayneObserdia
22:05  XTREM: where?
22:05  LayneObserdia: behind the line 9.value
22:06  LayneObserdia: and replace fileadmin/.. with the path to your php script
22:06  LayneObserdia: I think you will get the content of the variable $content in your script, right behind the <div id="footer"> in the frontend
22:08  XTREM: but, not into <div footer?
22:08  LayneObserdia: where do you have the closing </div> tag?
22:09  XTREM: jajaja 
22:09  XTREM: i don't know
22:10  XTREM: yes
22:10  XTREM: i know
22:10  XTREM: postCodeFooter
22:10  XTREM: well one sec
22:14  XTREM: for moment don't work
22:15  LayneObserdia: did you put the output in the $content variable?
22:17  XTREM: I only put this code in typoscript object browser
22:18  LayneObserdia: and adjusted the path to your script?
22:18  XTREM: uhm
22:18  XTREM: yes
22:18  LayneObserdia: fileadmin/php/... has be the path inclusive the filename to your php script
22:18  XTREM: fileadmin/php/pie.php
22:18  LayneObserdia: okay. and in your php script you have some output?
22:19  XTREM: no
22:19  XTREM: XD
22:19  LayneObserdia: xD what are you doing in the php script?
22:19  XTREM: but if put localhots/simple/pie.php
22:19  XTREM: i see output
22:20  LayneObserdia: na you have to copy your file to the location
22:20  XTREM: but if i put simple/pie.php in typoscript object browser
22:20  XTREM: LayneObserdia
22:20  XTREM: I copy with ftp
22:20  XTREM: the file
22:21  LayneObserdia: yeah you have to "store" the output from your php script in a variable called $content. I think typo3 will print out her content
22:21  XTREM: to fileadmin/php
22:21  LayneObserdia: best practice in my opinion is one ob_start(); at the beginning of your script and a $content = ob_get_clean();  at the end of your script
22:21  XTREM: uhm, I don't understan
22:22  LayneObserdia: you don'T get any output from the script, if you include it with the typoscript code
22:23  LayneObserdia: write $content = "hello world"; in your script and I hope you will the hello world where you wrote the typoscript code
22:23  XTREM: uhm
22:23  XTREM: wait
22:24  XTREM: I do a pie.php with <? $content= "hello world" ?> in fileadmin/php/
22:25  LayneObserdia: okay.
22:25  XTREM: fileadmin/php/pie.php
22:25  XTREM: don't show
22:26  LayneObserdia: try ctrl+shift+r in your browser when youre looking at the frontpage (in google chrome or firefox this will clear the cache for this page)
22:28  XTREM: if I put echo "hola";
22:28  XTREM: work
22:28  XTREM: well
22:29  XTREM: the file works
22:29  XTREM: but don't appears
22:29  XTREM: in web
22:29  XTREM: only have echo "Hola"
22:32  XTREM: LayneObserdia any idea?
22:32  LayneObserdia: I'm trying on my own one moment
22:32  XTREM: footer {   9 = TEXT;    9.value =<div id="footer"> ;	10 = PHP_SCRIPT;	10.file = simple/pie2.php; }
22:32  XTREM: ok
22:33  XTREM: thank you
22:36  XTREM: works?
22:38  XTREM: LayneObserdia ?
22:41  LayneObserdia: ok i don't get any problem
22:42  LayneObserdia: one moment
22:42  LayneObserdia: that's my pie.php http://dev.layne-obserdia.de/demo/pie.txt
22:44  LayneObserdia: in the same file you can now see my typoscript code
22:44  LayneObserdia: that will display test2 not test where you display the "lib.footer"
22:45  LayneObserdia: for testing i pasted this typoscript in a "introduction package" environment in the typoscript template "page" on page "page_configuration"
22:45  LayneObserdia: to override the default footer
23:04  LayneObserdia: XTREM still works fine for me
23:05  XTREM: hi
23:05  XTREM: sorry
23:05  XTREM: I dinner
23:06  XTREM: I was having dinner
23:06  LayneObserdia: XTREM np
23:06  XTREM: ok, I read
23:06  saedelaere: hi
23:07  saedelaere: anyone an idea how I could define that tt_address should use a replacement image if no image was defined in the persons data record
23:08  XTREM: don't work for me
23:09  LayneObserdia: XTREM you have the right paths? does any other typoscript work? like 10 = TEXT 10.value = test
23:10  XTREM: I don't have lib
23:10  XTREM: only footer
23:10  XTREM: header etc
23:10  LayneObserdia: XTREM yeah you have to change it for your configuration. that was an example from the introduction package
23:14  XTREM: YEAH!!!
23:14  XTREM: works
23:14  XTREM: fuck
23:14  LayneObserdia: nice =)
23:14  LayneObserdia: :D
23:14  XTREM: Muchisimas Gracias
23:14  XTREM: te debo una
23:15  XTREM: Muchisimas Gracias  te debo una
23:16  XTREM: Thank you so much I owe you
23:16  LayneObserdia: cool down^^
23:16  XTREM: I don't understand typo3 for now
23:16  XTREM: I edit .ts file
23:17  XTREM: and  i update from typoscript object browser
23:17  XTREM: Now, I see that in setup
23:17  XTREM: i have duplicated lines, one for each update, i think
23:19  LayneObserdia: you have .ts files? that's nice, but you can include them using a typoscript command in the setup and constants textarea
23:20  XTREM: joder, is better
23:20  LayneObserdia: <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE:fileadmin/typoscript.ts">
23:20  XTREM: then, setup and constants overwrite
23:20  XTREM: ?
23:20  LayneObserdia: change the path and paste it in your setup or constant
23:20  XTREM: I have other problem
23:21  XTREM: know appears test2
23:21  XTREM: but I change this
23:21  XTREM: I've changed 
23:22  XTREM: Why remains test2?
23:22  LayneObserdia: the output is cached
23:22  LayneObserdia: try ctrl+shift+r in google chrome or firefox whe nyo usee the frontpage
23:22  XTREM: no...
23:22  LayneObserdia: or change PHP_SCRIPT to PHP_SCRIPT_INT, then the output will not be cached
23:24  XTREM: yeah!
23:25  XTREM: LayneObserdia, since when you use typo3?
23:28  LayneObserdia: sine nearly 1 year. I'm a student in a web agency
23:28  XTREM: me too
23:28  LayneObserdia: but I'm programming with php and js, not rally typoscript...
