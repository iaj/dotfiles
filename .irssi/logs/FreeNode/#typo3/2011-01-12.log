08:26  iaj: which Extension is my best chose?
08:28  HardPhuck: you can do teasers with typosciprt
08:28  HardPhuck: typoscript
08:45  derape_: Hey there! Is it possible to use Typo3 globals like $GLOBALS['TSFE'] in a single php file? What do I have to include?
08:59  malte_: hi .. is there a possibility to outsource the dynamic javascript code in typo3
08:59  malte_: i use a gmenu
09:34  malte_: hi .. is there a possibility to outsource the dynamic javascript code in typo3
09:34  malte_: gmenu
09:35  iaj: HardPhuck: teasers with typoscript... like how?  got an example for me :)
09:35  iaj: and which news ext. do you recommen?
09:35  malte_: tt_news
09:39  HardPhuck: tt_news, yes
09:39  HardPhuck: http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-english/2005-September/013116.html   (google can be your friend)
09:40  malte_: any ideas about my javascript problem ?
09:41  HardPhuck: malte_: yes you can include your own javascript
09:42  malte_: its dynamic generated javascript
09:42  malte_: out of typo3
09:42  zorzar_: hey, somebody with a 4.0.1 installation asked me for help.  the switched servers and since then they can't upload files using new record/image.  the files are uploaded but the generated img tag in the html looks like this: <img src="" width="" height="" border="0" alt="" /> file is uploaded to uploads and if i try to access it using it's url i get it
09:44  malte_: everything right with the user/group rights ?
09:44  malte_: user:www-data or sth
09:45  HardPhuck: malte_: how is it generated?
09:45  malte_: gmenu
09:46  HardPhuck: can't help you then, never used GMENU
09:46  malte_: and mouseover
09:46  malte_: damn it
09:46  HardPhuck: is should be forbidden anyway
09:46  HardPhuck: :)
09:46  malte_: you only use text links?
09:46  HardPhuck: of course. GMENUs are no-no
09:47  malte_: some people want to have links in other font-faces than Arial/Verdana/Times and so on..
09:47  HardPhuck: they used to be cool 5+ years ago, today they are not necessary
09:47  malte_: sure
09:47  HardPhuck: malte yes, there are better alternatives than GMENU
09:47  malte_: how do you handle it? webfonts?
09:47  HardPhuck: cufon
09:47  malte_: nerver heard
09:47  HardPhuck: http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/
09:48  malte_: yes, i googled it

10:11  iaj: hmmm can someone tell me how I could check if a certain tt_content column is set to an image, in my case its neither the left,normal,right - i want to look if theres an image (type: image) embedded in that border column, and if it is.. take it and use it for my page.10.marks.HEADER.10.file -_-
10:12  iaj: else use the setting that is currently set on page.10.marks.HEADER.10.file (HEADER is a COA element in my case)
10:13  mambotech: anyone help with this one http://www.seton-tuning.co.uk/ please
10:24  maholtz|WORK: @iaj: you can use CONTENT with select.andWhere = (CType= image OR CType = textpic)   something like that (check syntax)
10:25  maholtz|WORK: @mambotech: uninstall extension cron_cssstyledimgtext - you do not need it anymore, it is in css_styled_content now (system extension)
10:25  maholtz|WORK: bbl
10:29  iaj: maholtz|WORK hm thanks.. the porblem for me is how I would tell typoscript to overwrite if theres something in there.. else.. just leave it
10:30  mambotech: hmm! what would cause this  Call to undefined function imagecreate() in /www/typo3_src-4.3.2/t3lib/class.t3lib_stdgraphic.php on line 3013, referer: http://www.seton-tuning.co.uk/typo3/sysext/viewpage/view/frameset.php?id=5

11:50  iaj: sorenmalling: thanks :-) 
11:53  sorenmalling: np :)
11:54  iaj: sorenmalling: mhh do I have to create a different news folder for the singleview page?
11:55  iaj: or do I just use the same?
11:55  iaj: because I get the error - nosinglePid 
11:56  iaj: defined there ^^
12:12  iaj: one has to specify on the single page where the single page is?  weird.. k its working now.
12:28  iaj: is there any way to configure TT_NEWS to have 4 elements where I can insert different textes?
12:40  HardPhuck: different textes?
12:47  bayer: i guess that in typo3 backend user passwords are stored as a hash (or similarly) and there's no way to look up the password for a user who forgot it, right?
12:48  DBunkerd: @bayer: right
12:49  bayer: ok, thx DBunkerd, just wanted to make sure... :)
13:13  zorzar_: somebody with a 4.0.1 installation asked me for help.  the switched servers and since then they can't upload files using new record/image.  the files are uploaded but the generated img tag in the html looks like this: <img src="" width="" height="" border="0" alt="" /> file is uploaded to uploads and if i try to access it using it's url i get it
13:13  sorenmalling: zorzar_: Any paths to imagemagick that have changed?
13:14  zorzar_: sorenmalling: ah good point... where is the path specified in typo3's config?
13:15  sorenmalling: You can find all the image processing settings inside the Install Tool
13:15  sorenmalling: "All Configuration"
13:19  zorzar_: sorenmalling: thx
13:19  sorenmalling: np :)
13:21  zorzar_: hmmm i can't login to the install tool
13:21  zorzar_: the hash the install tool shows me and the one in localconf.php match...
13:21  zorzar_: is this a known bug?
13:22  sorenmalling: Well the fact that you are still running 4.0.1 is more a bug :)
13:22  zorzar_: sorenmalling: yeah i know ;)
13:23  zorzar_: sorenmalling: it's a legacy system that obviously needs to be updated
13:24  sorenmalling: zorzar_: Try delete the temp_ files in typo3conf and try to login again
13:24  sorenmalling: And clear the cache and saved cookies from your browser
13:26  zorzar_: sorenmalling: hmmm didn't help
13:27  zorzar_: ahhh ther was another instalTool hash
13:30  zorzar_: sorenmalling: yeah it was imagemagick. thanks!

13:35  Nirvan: By mistake I clicked "Clear all" and data from Templavoila is gone..Even I relogin without save.. Is there any possibilities to bring back my data in Templavoila
13:40  sorenmalling: Nirvan: What "clear all" are you talking about?
13:40  Nirvan: In Templavoila..
13:41  sorenmalling: Where..
13:42  sorenmalling: TemplaVoila consists of two modules with a lot of functions
13:45  derape: Hey, is it possible to use Typo's GLOBAL variables in external PHP files? What do I need to include?
13:46  Nirvan: @sorenmalling: I have created a "Main Template" in Templavoila and below there is "Clear all"
13:46  soee: hi
13:46  sorenmalling: Nirvan: Okay, in the mapping process? 
13:47  Nirvan: Yes..
13:47  sorenmalling: If you haven't saved it, it doesn't exists other than in the "ram", you might be lucky that you can click the "back" button in your browser and it will turn up. but don't expect it, sorry
13:48  Nirvan: OH..
14:06  soee: guys take a look: http://pastebin.com/ERQH9ABu - this is how i set header type for my title filed in FCE, any  idea how can i assign some class to header if some checkbox in my FCE is checked ?
14:13  sorenmalling: soee: Can't you use if.isTrue.field 
14:14  soee: where exactly? the problem is that im using wrap to wrap text with headers tags, now this tags have to have some class depending of other field value
14:18  sorenmalling: soee: override.wrap = YOUR_WRAP override.if.isTrue.field = YOUR_FIELD
14:18  sorenmalling: soee: maybe that would work, untested!
14:19  soee: yeah ill try, do you have any idea what LOAD)REGISTER is for in T3 ?
14:19  soee: *LOAD_REGISTER
14:20  sorenmalling: soee: A way to move values between object, IIRC but have never really used it
14:23  chatzilla: hi
14:25  chatzilla: i have a HMENU and i need the submenu to be inside the <a> tag of the first level
14:25  chatzilla: is that possible?
14:26  chatzilla: like this: http://pastebin.com/t4zTM1hA
14:29  soee: chatzilla: i think you have to use wrap for the firstlevel
14:33  chatzilla: soee: i don't know what you mean exactly
14:43  soee: sorenmalling: it worked with override but instead wrap i had to use stdWrap.outerWrap.override
14:43  soee: with wrap the content was removed, dont know why
14:44  sorenmalling: Great :) well, great that you got it working, not that your content was removed :)
14:46  Phlunk3: lo, can anyone tell me if its possible to enable a HR button in the HTMLarea RTE? if not, then how can I add <hr> to the list of allowed tags?
14:49  No5251: Phlunk3: !google "typo3 rte hr" => showButtons := addToList(line)
14:49  Phlunk3: ahh line, was trying hr, got line already, damn :S
14:50  Phlunk3: must be a problem loading the tsconfig from install system, thx. 
14:54  chatzilla: can really nobody help me? i'm despairin
16:09  soee: can i vreate belayout for FCe the same way as for page template ?
16:09  soee: *create
16:35  iaj: hmmm
16:35  iaj: can someone help me with a tt_news issue...http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=24  how could I get rid of the [mehr] here?
17:11  tom_: iaj, you have to change the ts setup for your language - for french that would be  plugin.tt_news._LOCAL_LANG.fr.more = plus d'info
17:14  _ramo: hi
17:15  _ramo: does it make sense, to create a frontend plugin, which should represent an iframe, and the src attribute of this iframe is set by another extension?
17:21  Serpiente: _ramo: why should you do this? you can insert iframes actually directly on content pages
17:23  _ramo: Serpiente: this task of the exntesion should not only be the insertion of the iframe into the page... it should do some more things on the frontend later on
17:23  Serpiente: you are the only one who can decide wether it's useful or not
17:23  _ramo: e.g. playout of some other systems etc.
17:24  _ramo: okay, so the next question would be, how do i invoke another extension-method from a newly created one :)
17:25  soee: anyone who knows sf_books extension?
17:26  _ramo: Serpiente: so i defined the new extension as a content-extension. is that correct for my purpose referring to the iframe intent?
17:27  Serpiente: as long as I do not know whats the whole plan of that I cant help you out
17:27  _ramo: how should i explain :) 
17:28  _ramo: one task of that extension should be to integrate an iframe into a page. that iframe should retrieve the value for its source attribute from another extension
17:29  _ramo: okay, let this be the first task!
17:29  _ramo: the first and only one
17:54  Denyerek: Anyone here any good with Apache?
17:54  Denyerek: Having a real headache with VirtualHost :/
17:55  kitsunet: well, lets give it a try
17:58  Denyerek: Ok kitsunet
17:58  Denyerek: I'm having trouble with <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
17:58  Denyerek: I'll pate my config
17:58  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/LRDS5j8u
17:59  Denyerek: Then my main config:
18:01  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/NB63Si32
18:01  Denyerek: And the problem I get is this:
18:01  Denyerek: [warn] VirtualHost 212.64.151.87:443 overlaps with VirtualHost 212.64.151.87:443, the first has precedence, perhaps you need a NameVirtualHost directive
18:03  Denyerek: ries perhaps ?
18:04  kitsunet: is the config included in the order you posted it
18:04 @ries: Denyerek: you need to have a name virtualhost directive
18:05  kitsunet: he has one in the first pastebin, that is why I ask for the order
18:05  Denyerek: yes kitsunet
18:05  Denyerek: ports.conf goes in first
18:05  Denyerek: then everything in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
18:06 @ries: NameVirtualHost 212.64.151.87:443
18:07  Denyerek: Ries see here:
18:07  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/LRDS5j8u
18:07  Denyerek: line 5
18:08  Denyerek: The var is defined in /etc/apache2/envvars  
18:10 @ries: Denyerek: what file are you looking at??
18:10  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/LRDS5j8u   <-- ports.conf
18:11  Denyerek: http://pastebin.com/NB63Si32  <-- domain.conf
18:11 @ries: I have never seen you could use {$APACHE_SERVER_IP_1} as a variable within a config
18:11 @ries: I see it's possible, you have mod_env enabled to?
18:12  Denyerek: Hmm
18:12  Denyerek: It seems like my env-var doesn't work properly
18:12  Denyerek: It works within the vhost configs
18:13  Denyerek: but I have to hard-code the IP into ports.conf
18:13  kitsunet: but then it works?
18:14  Denyerek: Just checking
18:16  Denyerek: Well
18:16  Denyerek: it reboots apache without errors
18:16  Denyerek: but I can't connect
18:16  kitsunet: every ip hardcoded?
18:16  Denyerek: Oh, yes I can
18:17  Denyerek: Except...
18:17  Denyerek: weird
18:17  Denyerek: I don't see my index.html
18:17  Denyerek: I get offered to download a .part file
18:18  Denyerek: My PHP isn't running...
18:18  Denyerek: or at least ins't processing

19:05  fruchthoernschen: ries:  Do you know an good way to figure out which files my TYPO3 (database/row) does still need? I have a big /uploads/ folder, where are many many files inside which can be removed, but I must first save / lock the files which still needed. 
19:06 @ries: fruchthoernschen: I think there is a table in typo3 that tries to track teh files, but this can be turned off aswell
19:06  fruchthoernschen: oh, I think I have found an extensions: "http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/kb_cleanfiles/current/ ( kb_cleanfiles ), Cleans upload folders from unused files". 
19:06 @ries: further, there are some DB cleanup extensions... I never tried them msyelf though
19:07  fruchthoernschen: hmm okay, yes that was what I thinked, that typo3 will try to track every file hit. 
19:08  fruchthoernschen: thansk ries ;)
19:08  fruchthoernschen: I think the KB clean Files sounds nice. ;) 
19:14 @ries: be carefull still
19:14 @ries: Tracking will only happen if teh file is processed by the TYPO3 API's
19:14 @ries: some extension behave badly andthe file will not be tracked, but still be used
19:18  fruchthoernschen: hehe ;) 
19:19  fruchthoernschen: that's an good point, to check if I had used everytime the TYPO3 api's
