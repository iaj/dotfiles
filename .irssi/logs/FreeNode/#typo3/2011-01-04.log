11:39  bayer: hi there, i'm looking for a way to debug the following problem: we set up a varnish cache and put it in front of our typo3-server. logging in in BE works fine, but as soon as i open the site (FE), or click on the "view" module, i get logged out from typo3. i can use a second browser to view the FE without getting logged out. can i debug the reason for being logged out?
11:40  bayer: the varnish cache is configured like this: cookies are striped off, BE is deliverd uncached
11:48  ivaldi: bayer - how do the http headers look like ? ( i would say, that the FE removes the cookies?)
11:49  bayer: ivaldi, no, FE doesnt remove them, because there are google analytics cookies i simply remove all of them in varnish
11:50  Denyerek: HardPhuck: was your christmas nice?
11:50  bayer: do you want to see an example header?
11:51  ivaldi: yes - one of the varnish page

11:58  ivaldi: the be-cookie is already missing (in this request)
12:00 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 106 seconds
12:01  ivaldi: anyway - you should look for something like "be_typo_user=..." (cookie) and if it is changed or deleted 
12:02  bayer: ok
12:11  soee: if im using listStartId for LIST view in tt_news  pagebrowser generates navigation with items that shouldnt be there, any ide how can i fix this ?
