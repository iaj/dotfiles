09:43  naga: ha ha ha
09:43  naga: ok
09:43  naga: no problem! i have installed flashslideshow extension and implemented successfully
09:44  naga: apearing on frontend is fine but problem with resolution ( pressing ctl+ and ctl-)
09:45  naga:  flash image gallery is not streching on changing resolution by ctl+ or ctl- ( happening for html layout)
09:45  naga: can some one help on this?
09:46  naga: please
09:47  pharno: I need your help:
09:47  pharno: PHP Warning: filemtime() [function.filemtime]: stat failed for /home/brokerdev.web13.wmc.ch/public_html/typo3conf/ext/t3skin_improved/stylesheets/stylesheet.css" /><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../typo3conf/ext/chloginskin/res/login1.css in /home/brokerdev.web13.wmc.ch/public_html/t3lib/class.t3lib_compressor.php line 181
09:47  pharno: file permissions are checked, can access the file via opera
09:47  pharno: wb
09:47  fruchthoernschen: naga:  I think that is normal. because that is an browser zoom, the flash Application must have an support for zooming. 
09:48  fruchthoernschen: hmm pharno sounds like an coding issue or so. not like an permissing issue. 
09:49  pharno: well, one can lead to the other...
09:49  pharno: maybe I should mention that I just made an update from 4.3.3 to 4.4.6
09:49  pharno: database is updated an checked
09:50  naga: fruchthoernschen: its normal , i can see text scale property in extension but it shoud be dropdown
09:50  naga: flash files also expand with basic html ,which is happening everywhere 
09:50  naga: including youtube
09:51  naga: i dont know what to do
09:51  naga: can some one help me?
09:51  fruchthoernschen: pharno:  can be that the ext. for better backend skin/s are obsolved because since TYPO3 4.4 there is an new Skinning Api and so.
09:51  fruchthoernschen: if someone can help, he will write ;)
09:52  fruchthoernschen: give us a bit of time to answer.
09:52  naga: ok
09:53  fruchthoernschen: hmm I think if you want to zoom into your flash gallery, then there must be an function as an Button for example for zooming in/out. the Function of the Short-Keys which belongs to the browser doesn't zoom all media-types like flash, or the flash tool has an condition for this, but I think most haven't this featuree
09:54  fruchthoernschen: hmm 
09:54  fruchthoernschen: wait
09:54  fruchthoernschen: I think I have again not realy understand the problem. 
09:54  naga: its not zooming
09:54  naga: can u visit this site http://p133871.typo3server.info
09:55  fruchthoernschen: is the Problem that the normal text in the flash is zooming and the other types inside the flash like images are not zooming and so it doesn't look well?
09:55  naga: see on pressing ctl+
09:55  fruchthoernschen: mittwald ;)
09:55  danielawaranie: hi all
09:55  naga: layout expands but not the flash which remains same width 
09:55 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
09:55  danielawaranie: extbase: how to validate form fields that are not part of a domain model?
09:57  naga: fruchthoernschen : u got the problem?
09:58  iaj: fruchthoernschen: ahhhhh yaeh... sorry I didn't think about that :)
09:58  fruchthoernschen: naga:  yeah yeah ;) that was what I mean.
09:58  fruchthoernschen: naga:  but a bit of google, I found this: http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showthread.php3?t=224812
09:59  fruchthoernschen: it is possible but the flash Appliation must support or better said, handel this case 
09:59  fruchthoernschen: iaj: okay, I'm everytime happy if I can help. But what have I done? 
10:00  fruchthoernschen: extbase is not my knowledge ;)
10:01  fruchthoernschen: naga:  here is more about the topic: http://aralbalkan.com/745 http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/scaling_flash_movies_to_match 
10:03  naga: first thread is not going to help
10:03  naga: checking second one
10:03  fruchthoernschen: hehe iaj I understand ;)
10:03  naga: even second one
10:04  naga: fruchthoernschen : to support zooming what i need is scale property to that extension
10:04  fruchthoernschen: naga:  I think you mist write the developer of the ext. He can fix it or if you have the flash application and the flash application source code then you can fix it 
10:04  naga: he has provided scale property but in text
10:05  fruchthoernschen: can be, I'm not an flash expert. But I think the way which I have explained is right. It can be that you can solve it also with an bit of javascript. 
10:05  naga: how do i mention that, it should be drop down 
10:05  naga: this can be solved mentioning scale value
10:06  naga: fruchthoernschen : u know any other module provides same functionality , having banner with dynamic text fade in / out
10:07  fruchthoernschen: hmm done it with javascript?
10:07  naga: any one with image banners with dynamic text on all images of banner
10:07  fruchthoernschen: yes, check again your link. Should possible with javascript
10:08  fruchthoernschen: if there is no special font needed
10:11  fruchthoernschen: naga:  check the jQuery UI Framework out, http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/ 
10:13  fruchthoernschen: in the dropdown box on http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/ you can select "Shake" and you get an shake effect, so you must only combine two effects. and have the same what the flash does in javascript. should work.
10:14  naga: fruchthoernschen : i dont understand what u trying to say
10:14  naga: u want me to crreate new banner extn
10:14  fruchthoernschen: yes;)
10:14  naga: oh 
10:15  danielawaranie: hi: where do i find extbase developers (chat)?
10:15  naga: i am new bee to typo3
10:15  naga: not that much knowledge on typo
10:15  naga: flash banner provides everyhting than this zooming effect
10:15  fruchthoernschen: hmm 
10:15  naga: i usually work on magento
10:16  fruchthoernschen: hmm write an mail to the developer I think he will help
10:16  naga: yup
10:16  naga: that will be good idea
10:16  fruchthoernschen: hehe ;) the second one which writes "yup" in an english talk ;)
10:16  fruchthoernschen: .. for this day
10:17  naga: hhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaa

10:47  smichaelsen: but lang is en
10:49  danslo: smichaelsen: I wasn´t planning on talking german (I´m dutch)... just looking for a kind german that can give me a decent translation of the sentence ´...und jeder irgendwie´ :P
10:50  smichaelsen: und jeder irgendwie => and somehow anybody
10:50  smichaelsen: not quite a complete sentence, but that's what it means
10:50  danslo: smichaelsen: I got that far with google translate, but it doesnt make much sense to me... how would you place that into context?
10:52  smichaelsen: @danslo I can not really think of a good contect. Which context do you have it from?
10:52  smichaelsen: Hm, need to get used to irc commands again
10:55  danslo: smichaelsen: just a translation that says ´ und jeder irgendwie´ .. oh well, I will just translate it to make sense :P thanks
10:56  smichaelsen: und => and, jeder => anybody/everyone, irgendwie => somehow.. I can not tell you any better translation
10:56  smichaelsen: np
11:06  bartbogdan: Hi All
11:06  bartbogdan: Does anyone have any experience with spontaneous frontend logouts?
11:07  bartbogdan: When a user logs in he the login seems to have succeeded at first
11:07  bartbogdan: but navigating to any other page logs him out again
11:07  bartbogdan: even doing an ajax call
11:08  bartbogdan: ip locking is set to 0
11:09  smeringe: hi. anyone here who has experience in using varnish with typo3?  (http://www.varnish-cache.org/)
11:10  danslo: bartbogdan: this is a long shot, but are you perhaps using multiple domains? I had a similar issue like that once (cookie not stored across different domains doh) - otherwise I have no idea
11:16  bartbogdan: danslo: No, I know that issue
11:16  bartbogdan: danslo: in this case it is a single domain
11:17  bartbogdan: danslo: however, I'm having typo3 do a redirect from the wwwless domain to www.
11:22  danslo: bartbogdan: that could be an issue, I also have had (backend!) login issues on non-www URL (probably due to baseURL or something)
12:05  bartbogdan: Hee Mhogerheijde
12:05  mhogerheijde: Hey bartbogdan
12:05  bartbogdan: Gezellig hier hoor
12:05  mhogerheijde: Ja toch!
12:11  naga: fruchthoernschen:
12:11  naga: u there?
12:12  naga: what is Title     Indexed Search Engine?
12:12  naga: is this default one with typo?
12:12  naga: or different extn?
12:25  cervera: good mornıng everyone
12:26  cervera: anyone has experience in setting up air_filemanager extension?
13:30  Azrael_-: hi
13:41  Azrael_-: i to create a new website using typo3. everything can be solved quite easily with static content but i want to display a countrylist. if you open it you get a list of companies for this country. does anybody know a plugin for this?
13:59  chatzilla: hi
13:59  chatzilla: i need some help with a typoscript menu: http://pastebin.com/u77ZeZ2q
13:59  chatzilla: the linkWrap in the first thing does not seem to work
14:00  chatzilla: because i do not find any <!--[if IE 7]> in the resulting source code
14:00  chatzilla: what am i missing?
14:00  chatzilla: i've been despairing on this for almost a day now
14:01  anteatersa: are there any good tutorials / documentation for tt_products specifically how implement your own handlescript?
14:04  anteatersa: anyone ever read this book: https://www.packtpub.com/design-build-feature-rich-online-store-using-typo3-4-2-e-commerce/book
14:04  anteatersa: any good?
14:19  MarcelT3_: Azrael_-: u could create that without a plugin but only using one form and some typoscript. you put the country selector in the form and put a typoscript condition on the resulting get variable
14:22  MarcelT3_: chatzilla: i cannot help you at a quick shot but are you trying to use a tablebased menu for IE6 and an ul based menu for IE7 ? if so, you could just create a condition like [browser = msie]&&[version < 7] to overwrite the ul menu for the older ie...
14:23  chatzilla: yes, that's what i'm trying to do. now the problem is that GMENU doesn't have linkWrap
14:23  chatzilla: i'm trying a GIFBUILDER approach
14:24  MarcelT3_: hmm, i still would create the ordinary (good) menu with UL LI and only for nasty browsers overwrite the temp.menu object with tables and else.
14:27  Azrael_-: MarcelT3_: sounds interesting. just started with typo3 and i have to admit: the volume of options makes me erratic
14:27  MarcelT3_: Azrael_-: you´ll love it =D
14:28  Azrael_-: used mostly joomla till now. any good tutorial on how to use typo3 4.4?
14:29  MarcelT3_: when it comes to documentations for beginners... hmm i don´t know of so much tutorials. mostly in book form. but to help you with your countryselector:
14:29  Azrael_-: atm i dunno where to start
14:29  Azrael_-: countryselector isn't a priority yet. first need to get a basic understanding of typo3 before starting scripting
14:29  MarcelT3_: [globalVar = GP:country=nl] <--- would filter for the Get/Post Variable country to be nl
14:30  Azrael_-: hope you won't get mad too soon as long as i bug you all in here with noobie-questions :)
14:30  MarcelT3_: this might be good for you: http://wiki.typo3.org/Getting_started
14:30  Azrael_-: already reading
15:01  pduersteler: hm.. i need to change something in a foreign page. there is a 3-liner -> http://pastie.org/1460018  but i'm not sure where it is loading the images 
15:03  MarcelT3_: you can search for the use of "lib.image" in the setup by using the magnifying glass icon in the upper right of the backend. just search for "lib.image"
15:03  pduersteler: ok
15:03  pduersteler: it points the template and the templavoila template where it is defined
15:04  pduersteler: i know that they are defined there. but i need to know to where it points. id 8 doesn't give me a hint at all :-/
15:07  MarcelT3_: well, it kinda sounds like tt_content:8
15:07  MarcelT3_: what appears if you search for "tt_content:8" ?
15:10  pduersteler: mmmh
15:10  pduersteler: nifty
15:10  pduersteler: someone put a plugin in a sysfolder 
15:10  pduersteler: to get random pics from a folder -.-
15:13  MarcelT3_: ^^
15:13  pduersteler: thank you ;)
15:13  MarcelT3_: welcome
15:14  Rapp: hi everybody
15:14  Rapp: what's the variable $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['encryptionKey'] for?
15:15  MarcelT3_: Rapp: it´s the "salt" to encrypt some stuff
15:16  MarcelT3_: just hit "generate" in the basic tab of the install tool and clear all the caches if you don´t like the current salt ;)
15:18  Rapp: ok
15:39  wsanders: hey people
15:39  wsanders: I'm trying to set up a flexform using IRRE to add new entries
15:39  wsanders: and each time I click the "new entry"-link, I get a "Wrong configuration in table tt_content" error
15:40  wsanders: I've been through just about everything now, and I have no idea what's wrong
15:40  wsanders: does anyone have any idea what I could be doing wrong?
15:41  wsanders: to specify, I just need to relate to a single table, and if I change "type" to "select", I get a nice list of the entries currently in the table for the current page
15:42  wsanders: and I've allowed the table-records to be created on both pages and through records
