17:13  iaj: lo there guys
17:14  VonGodric: 4.5?
17:14  iaj: ive got a question, for now Im using the following : http://pastebin.com/CJMjwV2J
17:15  PiMB: alright
17:15  iaj: however I want to set the value.data  according to whether there is some data in the TSFE:fe_user|sesData|powermail_3641|uid288   - OR if theres data in TSFE:fe_user|sesData|powermail_3642|uid290
17:15  maholtz|WORK: @VonGodric: 4.5. is not released, so better use 4.4.3 f.e. http://sourceforge.net/projects/typo3/files/TYPO3%20Introduction%20Package/introductionpackage-4.4.3.zip/download
17:15  iaj: how could I achieve such a - 'switch-case' ?
17:15  maholtz|WORK: (i did not checked, if the files are in there)
17:15  VonGodric: ok. cool
17:16  PiMB: iaj, do you know the actual value that should be there, or is it open input?
17:17  iaj: PiMB: nah.. well its a page im getting directed to through powermail (from 3 various sites)
17:17  iaj: so I don't want to build 3 extra sites.. only one with a check which fields got filled in
17:17  iaj: various/ different sites... 
17:18  PiMB: so, you're redirecting from a different site to your powermail form
17:19  PiMB: and want to check what is filled in?
17:19  maholtz|WORK: @VonGodric: i tried 4.4.2 which has no files in fileadmin either. i wonder if i am totally wrong with that...?
17:19  iaj: the other site is a powermail form (the previous one)
17:20  VonGodric: I don't know. I am installing the 4.4.3 now
17:20  iaj: and on the page im sitting on with the check - theres another powermail form - i just want the fields to be filled with the stuff the user entered on the form before
17:20  VonGodric: lets see if this will work
17:20  iaj: you get me PiMB ?
17:21  maholtz|WORK: hm.. i think i am wrong and they should be copied if you install the introduction package...
17:21  maholtz|WORK: perhaps you had some permission problems before?
17:21  iaj: either uid288 from powermail_3641 OR uid290 from powermail_3642 got filled in the page where the user was before.
17:21  PiMB: @iaj, yeah i do
17:21  iaj: now I want to do a switch case - which one -_-
17:22  PiMB: alright, and you have 1 field in the new form which should be filled with either?
17:22  iaj: yeah.
17:22  VonGodric: maholtz|WORK: this is fresh blank install. Using the default installer. blank once again http://batman.coandcouk.com/stuff/typo3/
17:22  iaj: I got that field working already - but only from one page so far - so now I need a distinguishiation (is that word exist.?)
17:24  PiMB: not sure, sure looks nice though :)
17:24  PiMB: isn't it possible to fill the form with both fields?
17:25  PiMB: cause one of them is empty, it will always look like it's filled with the proper data
17:25  iaj: mhh well i guess it gets overwritten to nuffing
17:25  iaj: if I use 3642 as second argument
17:26  PiMB: not if you combine it to 1 data
17:26  iaj: can you gimme an example?
17:26  iaj: pleazzzzze :)
17:27  PiMB: hehe, working on something quick
17:27  PiMB: No idea if it's going to work
17:28  PiMB: http://pastebin.com/sMdqLfdA
17:28  PiMB: something like that?
17:28  PiMB: not sure though if the value has a cObject possibility
17:30  iaj: heh... thansk man im gonna try it out tomorrow
17:30  iaj: and let you know:)
17:30  PiMB: good
