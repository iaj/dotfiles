09:21  pharno: is there somewhere a dev channel with more than 1 user?
09:21  GroenDraakie: mostly this is quite crowded :)
09:22  pharno: #typo3-dev?
09:22  PiMB: pharno, just a sec mate
09:22  PiMB: it's early
09:23  PiMB: most dev's get in around 9-10 in the morning gmt+1
09:23  pharno: well, depends where you are...
09:23  pharno: gtm+1? 9.23?
09:23  GroenDraakie: yup
09:24  GroenDraakie: here at the office only 4 of the 25 people are present now...
09:24  pharno: well okay
09:24  pharno: Ill wait then I guess...
09:25  PiMB: well, if you've got a question someone here might be able to help?
09:25  GroenDraakie: depends on what you're looking for of course
09:26  pharno: well, I have an extension with 2 frontend plugins. They have the same config, but only one does show up
09:26  pharno: well, name is different of course
09:29  pharno: seems like noone's got a clue, right?
09:33  PiMB: mate, it's 4 minutes ago
09:33  PiMB: gotta have some patience..
09:33  PiMB: a lot of people here are working at the same time
09:33  PiMB: how are you trying to load your plugins?
09:36  pharno: you mean new page content? thats wher I expected it to show up
09:39  pharno: hm, seems like the kickstarter doesnt update ext_localconf.php and ext_tables.php

10:15  pharno: good morning
10:21  Prot0: morning
10:21  aterriblechaos: good morning
10:23  funkytown: Is there something like "showNewsWithoutDefaultTranslation = 1" (tt_news) for content elements, too?
10:33  unmatrix: i know there is a setting to change the behavior of the transplation-framework - but what was the name again?
10:36  snoy_ms: Hey all. Someone has a good example (website) with using tt_news and categories? Need it for showing a usecase
10:38  snoy_ms: I want to use tt_news for "events". In this case i have to use categories. Just need a working example to show it......
10:39  FloLeBlanc: hi all
10:39  snoy_ms: hey
10:41  FloLeBlanc: how's life
10:41  snoy_ms: fine :-)
10:41  snoy_ms: no one? Just need an example to show this feature. (tt_news and using Kategories)
10:41  FloLeBlanc: is anyone in here certified actually? (just curious)
10:42  unmatrix: (got it - sys_language_mode)
10:42  funkytown: unmatrix: Got that, changed to "strict" - the problem about that: A secondary translation still needs a specific content element to be available in the default language
10:44  unmatrix: i need "content_fallback" ;)
10:44  funkytown: Which means that if there's not translated content, typo3 will show the content in the default language. But that's bad for my needs..
10:45  unmatrix: :/
10:45  funkytown: The main problem anyway is that a user can't create elements in a secondary language. He would need access to the default language to create the element in the default language first - but that's exactly what the customer does *not* want. Spanish user > only access to spanish content, etc
10:46  funkytown: Any hints about that? Normal behavior?
10:47  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: how do you mean? there are lots of sites online that use tt_news with categories .. for example http://www.suedtirolnews.it/
10:47  unmatrix: i think you can restric the access of the default-language to read-only
10:48  unmatrix: oh - i misunderstood  your problem - don't know
10:48  funkytown: unmatrix: That would be kinda interesting. But still: If the spanish user wants to create a new element in spanish, he would need the content be available in default language before :/
10:50  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: I just need an example like yours to show how Categories could be used. Politik, Leute, Lokal..... Are they working with Categories and Relations ?
10:50  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: seems so
10:50  FloLeBlanc: snoy_ms: didn't see your post - what do you need?
10:50  FloLeBlanc: a finished example of categories?
10:51  snoy_ms: FloLeBlanc: yes, just a usecase. aterriblechaos sent me this http://www.suedtirolnews.it/
10:51  FloLeBlanc: well that is a good example, there are categories :)
10:51  snoy_ms: and relations :-)
10:52  snoy_ms: its easier to show an example as explain it to customers
10:53  FloLeBlanc: :)
10:53  FloLeBlanc: if you need a split example: http://www.billardcafe.at/infos/geschichte-billard/ (we have 2 "trees") of news, one for tourney players (pink) one general news (yellow)
10:54  snoy_ms: FloLeBlanc: my plan is to use it for "events". Just simple events..
10:54  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: yes they are catories, relations are not used in this project, the related news list is done by searching for news  with similar keywords
10:55  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: ahh, ok thx :-)
10:56  snoy_ms: FloLeBlanc: thx, too.
11:01  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: Do you know if they export articles in any way for print? For example pdf or csv.
11:02  FloLeBlanc: snoy_ms: yw
11:02  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: no, they dont export in any way
11:02  aterriblechaos: (for print, only rss)
11:03  aterriblechaos: t3n.de made a publishing system for there website and the actual print magazine iirc. but still closed source
11:07  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: iam in search of such a system to clean up the process between web and print
11:08  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: there is also a small diplom work, but it never finished
11:08  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: tt_content -> xml,xls,xlst -> indesign
11:09  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: now i got it.... "cross media puplishing". 
11:09  sorenmalling: snoy_ms: We have done some work where data has been processed to a xml file and them imported to indesign
11:10  sorenmalling: Don't make it harder than it is :)
11:10  sorenmalling: 
11:10  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: does it work for you ?
11:10  maholtz|WORK: @sorenmalling: do you need special tools for indesign?
11:10  sorenmalling: Yes, we simply make a XML file (dynamicly) and in indesign you are able to map xml data (by giving it a url) to places in the document
11:10  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: i mean, did your processes get smaller in the end
11:10  sorenmalling: No, no special tools needed
11:11  sorenmalling: Our client used to write the whole indesign document manually and copy/paste data, so we made a lot easier process for them :)
11:11  tf: is http://t3paste.org working???
11:11  snoy_ms: maholtz|WORK: you can even link images with xml in indesign (as far as i know)
11:12  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: http://www.typo3-talk.net/index.php?id=34&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=19&tx_ttnews[backPid]=3&cHash=eefdbd8891 looks good, he published 3 extensions for indesign export
11:12  sorenmalling: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/indesign.html
11:12  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: sound realy cool. And i think its even perfect for small mailings where only content change
11:13  sorenmalling: We found it really cool ourself, we haven't worked with it before so were a bit sceptic, but we found it really easy and straight forward
11:14  snoy_ms: sorenmalling: i also think that cross-media is an upcoming topic.
11:14  maholtz|WORK: @sorenmalling: but you need to put the content by hand into the indesing document? It is not possible to do that autmatically? So the amount of content could change?
11:15  sorenmalling: maholtz|WORK: I have only been a small part of the indesign work, but you map your xml properties to your indesign document and it automaticly insert the data
11:16  snoy_ms: maholtz|WORK: yeah, as far as i know. You get the xml tree within indesign. Then you can go though this tree and drag the content into the indesign document
11:16  sorenmalling: maholtz|WORK: Try look at the link i senty
11:16  sorenmalling: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/04/indesign.html
11:16  maholtz|WORK: i do :)
11:16  sorenmalling: :)
11:16  sorenmalling: It got some screenshots too ;)
11:17  maholtz|WORK: @snoy_ms: not "can" drag the content but "have to"
11:17  snoy_ms: maholtz|WORK: yes...haha
11:19  snoy_ms: small example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDqHX6KHb0
11:19  Saco: repositery down?
11:19  Saco: *Repository
11:20  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: he never finished the ext, or ?
11:22  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: afaik he finished, they are on forge
11:22  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: wow, cool. Didn't saw that :-)
11:23  Saco: Anyone know if the repository is down?
11:24  teppi|work: Saco, do you mean TER ?
11:25  FloLeBlanc: still having the #1203699034: A cache with identifier "cache_hash" does not exist Problem with mm_forum - any ideas?
11:25  teppi|work: its not down for me
11:25  Winston_S: Saco, define "repository". i just was able to download a t3x from TER
11:27  funkytown: Any hints on following? I got a site with multiple languages and one BE user for each language. Now users can't create new content elements in their own language when there's no translation for the default language. Users would need access to the default language to create the element there first and then translate it to their languages. But that's exactly what the customer does *not* want. A 
11:27  funkytown: user of a secondary language should be able to create as many elements as he wants to.
11:27  aterriblechaos: snoy_ms: http://forge.typo3.org/users/3863 here is Timo Schmidt on forge, the 3 Projects he is maintaining relate to the xml export
11:28  snoy_ms: aterriblechaos: i checked the video. Nice solution.
11:29  aterriblechaos: funkytown: i dont know the exact keyword, but you need to play with config.sys_language_* ( see tsref )
11:29  funkytown: aterriblechaos: sys_language_mode = strict maybe? That's something different :/
11:30  aterriblechaos: "strict - The system will report an error if the requested translation does not exist. " if thats ok for you ;)
11:31  funkytown: aterriblechaos: Like I said, that's unfortunately something different. That's the frontend translation behavior :(

14:09  GroenDraakie: About the headers:
14:09  GroenDraakie: ah no... first: content
14:10  GroenDraakie: click "Page(tv)" and then Homepage
14:10  adnc: tuxx, is this site done with templa-voila?
14:10  GroenDraakie: adnc: yup
14:10  tuxx: adnc: ye
14:10  adnc: cool
14:10  GroenDraakie: The content isn't linked
14:10  adnc: i'm working with markers and wondering if tv would be easier
14:10  GroenDraakie: tuxx: click non-used elements
14:11  GroenDraakie: adnc: I like Templavoila better: less text editor, more flexibility
14:11  GroenDraakie: tuxx: link these elements somewhere in the Content blocks
14:11  adnc: on a standardinstallation there is no tv
14:11  tuxx: um....
14:12  GroenDraakie: adnc: true. Import it via the extension manager
14:12  tuxx: how do you "link" them?
14:12  tuxx: sry for being so ignorant
14:12  Chiz: What type of extension can be in Typo3?
14:12  tuxx: ive never used typo3
14:12  GroenDraakie: tuxx: first icon is create reference
14:12  GroenDraakie: after that, you can paste them
14:13  GroenDraakie: tuxx: np. Everyone has to start somewhere. Yust tell me if I'm not clear :)
14:13  tuxx: brilliant :D
14:13  tuxx: GroenDraakie: your the best
14:13  tuxx: thanks so much
14:13  GroenDraakie: :D
14:13  GroenDraakie: tuxx: you still want h5 instead of h1?
14:13  tuxx: GroenDraakie: i dont know
14:13  tuxx: wtf that is
14:14  GroenDraakie: ah no, that's adnc ;)
14:14  GroenDraakie: sorry for the confusion
14:14  GroenDraakie: adnc: have you found a solution?
14:15  tuxx: GroenDraakie: btw
14:15  tuxx: typo3 must reside in the same directory as the homepage?
14:15  tuxx: that feels kind of weird
14:15  GroenDraakie: yes, or you point your apache to the right place
14:15  tuxx: should i just add a .htpasswd?
14:16  tuxx: in the typo3 directory
14:16  GroenDraakie: the admin has a password
14:16  tuxx: yea i know
14:16  tuxx: well ok
14:16  GroenDraakie: I've never needed a separate password. I think i would go crazy if Apache asked for a password and then typo3 did that again
14:17  tuxx: hehe ok
14:17  tuxx: i dont trust php shit
14:17  tuxx: my last server got compromised through roundcube webmail 
14:17  GroenDraakie: hmmm, then what do you trust ?
14:17  influenzjaaa: Hey. How to add a clicktag to swf flash file via Pagecontent > Type: Multimedia > Parameters?
14:17  adnc: GroenDraakie, i don't know if I should starting with tv. actually all i want for the moment ist that the header of a content i had in the sidebar (getRight) is going to be <h5> wraped (layout 5) as default instead of <h1>
14:17  tuxx: i trust apache more than opensource php shit
14:17  GroenDraakie: ah ok... roundcube security issue?
14:17  tuxx: yea
14:17  GroenDraakie: apache is open source, as is php
14:18  tuxx: ofcourse it is
14:18  tuxx: but it is audited FAR more
14:18  tuxx: than some random opensource php project such as typo3
14:19  GroenDraakie: but typo3 has been here for some time now. I don't think it's severely flawed
14:19  tuxx: ok
14:19  Prot0: TYPO3 isnt exactly a random open source project
14:19  GroenDraakie: You always can harden your php install (safe mode and the such)
14:19  PiMB: wow mate, a random open source projecT?
14:19  tuxx: yea i guess im just being paranoid
14:19  tuxx: it will be fine
14:19  PiMB: have you ever dugg into the setup of TYPO3 and the teams behind it?
14:24  GroenDraakie: adnc: that's not tv or marker-stuff
14:24  tuxx: GroenDraakie: i hated typo3
14:24  GroenDraakie: adnc: that's typoscript setup stuff
14:24  tuxx: until a few minutes ago
14:25  GroenDraakie: tuxx: glad to be of service :) You'll hate it some more when doing interresting stuff, but as far as I have seen, in the end it always delivers
14:26  adnc: GroenDraakie, do you know how to do it with typoscript?
14:26  PiMB: 'TYPO3 is a mountain to climb, but the view is spectacular'
14:26  GroenDraakie: I'm looking into it now.
14:26  adnc: thanks
14:26  tuxx: i sometimes feel it is very little responsive
14:26  GroenDraakie: adnc: it has to do with lib.stdheader
14:26  tuxx: i click edit
14:26  tuxx: and wait 15 secs
14:27  tuxx: for something to happen.. kinda annoying
14:28  GroenDraakie: adnc: what kind of content element are you using?
14:28  adnc: GroenDraakie, how can i find this out. i use text with image
14:28  GroenDraakie: ah ok... textpic
14:30  aterriblechaos: you should be able to set defaultheader type with a register
14:30  tuxx: hey guys.. when editing the content of my page
14:30  aterriblechaos: uhm. google knows it best: http://www.acqal.com/blog/a/article/set-a-default-header-type-for-templavoila-content-elements/
14:30  GroenDraakie: aterriblechaos: true, but not only for the right column
14:30  tuxx: how do i save my modifications?? i see no save button 
14:30  adnc: GroenDraakie, exact
14:30  tuxx: page -> site -> edit entry 
14:30  tuxx: how do you save these changes?
14:31  GroenDraakie: tuxx: floppy-icon in top
14:31  aterriblechaos: y.. thats done by setting the register and after doing a restore_register
14:31  GroenDraakie:  14:30            tuxx   page -> site -> edit entry 
14:31  tuxx: ohhh
14:31  GroenDraakie: sorry, wrong button :)
14:31  tuxx: hehe
14:31  GroenDraakie: aterriblechaos: that's also a way of course.
14:32  GroenDraakie: I was thinking of using the tt_content.textpic.10.something to change the tag
14:32  GroenDraakie: only thing is: with markers you have a position-value, with templavoila you don't
14:33  GroenDraakie: so I cannot reproduce the exact code here
14:33  aterriblechaos: would not do that... when you use the registerit is more flexible because it works for every content element
14:33  aterriblechaos: also when setting the register you dont care about the position value
14:33  GroenDraakie: true. If you need that :)
14:33  adnc: mh
14:34  aterriblechaos: imho the approcah on acqal.com is really flexible and good, works with templavoila and all other templating methods
14:34  GroenDraakie: I think the problem is that you DO care about the position value. Al adnc stated: he wants to have the headers in the right column to be h5 instead of h1
14:35  aterriblechaos: yes, exactly that is done in the example
14:35  aterriblechaos: 1. step load_register and set it to the new default type, 2. step display it, 3. step restore the register to its original value ..
14:36  GroenDraakie: aterriblechaos: ah: it uses a typo3-custom object inside of a container... OK, I like
14:37  GroenDraakie: adnc: what aterriblechaos said :D
14:38  adnc: but how do i load register?
14:39  GroenDraakie: adnc: the only thing I don't know now is how to use this code sample in a marker layout...
14:39  GroenDraakie: maybe aterriblechaos can point it out for you
14:40  adnc: aterriblechaos, that would be really nice
14:40  aterriblechaos: moment ill pastebin
14:42  aterriblechaos: http://pastebin.com/vd7BvqTp
14:42  tuxx: GroenDraakie: do you use typo3 profesionally...
14:42  aterriblechaos: forgot the load_register ... http://pastebin.com/Gc8NfsfN
14:43  adnc: aterriblechaos, thank you very much. i'll try that now
14:46  tuxx: is typo3 > joomla?
14:49  adnc: aterriblechaos, yess, thank you
14:49  adnc: GroenDraakie, thank you aswell

15:18  funkytown: Any hints on following? I got a site with multiple languages and one BE user for each language. Now users can't create new content elements in their own language when there's no translation for the default language. Users would need access to the default language to create the element there first and then translate it to their languages. But that's exactly what the customer does *not* want. A 
15:18  funkytown: user of a secondary language should be able to create as many elements as he wants to.
15:20  tuxx: grndrkie|AFK: buddy? :D
15:20  tuxx: grndrkie|AFK: i think i dont like my template :D
15:20  PiMB: I've seen the behaviour before yeah
15:20  PiMB: @ funkytown
15:20  PiMB: not sure what the solution is or if there even is one.
15:20  tuxx: grndrkie|AFK: can i simply remove it and import a new one? or will i screw things up?
15:20  PiMB: I know this is
15:21  PiMB: ''normal' behaviour for T3
15:21  funkytown: PiMB: Now this sucks.
15:22  aterriblechaos: there is a way around.. if your backend user are able to create the elements you just need to adjust the language mode and overlay in typoscript config. if your be user cant create the elements its problably a setting in your templavoila ds
15:28  funkytown: I checked the language options in my ds there. Seems to be okay
15:29  funkytown: and in my root page's TSConfig I added mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.translationParadigm = free
15:31  aterriblechaos: still you are not able to create a element on the translated page ?
15:31  aterriblechaos: i dont have a templavoila instalation to check this out, i dont use templavoila a lot
15:36  funkytown: aterriblechaos: Yeah, still not able to
15:38  aterriblechaos: funkytown: according to mailinglist you need this settings in your page ds http://pastebin.com/EwhbVSL0
15:40  funkytown: aterriblechaos: Tried that too, ain't working for me :/
15:42  aterriblechaos: hm. it is something related to templavoila, im quite shure that this behaviour can be configured in ds
15:45  funkytown: I've been reading tutorials, hints, forum threads, mailinglist entries etc for the last 4 hours and nothing worked to far.
15:47  aterriblechaos: if you know german i would just follow http://www.typo3-media.com/blog/article/mehrsprachigkeit-und-templavoila.html 
15:48  funkytown: Did that - not working ;)
15:50  aterriblechaos: ok than i cant help you, i usually dont use templavoila. Last time it worked for me changing the ds
15:51  adnc: aterriblechaos, is it possible to add a small margin to the bottom of that <h5> or even a class so I could manage the margin stuff in the css file?
15:53  aterriblechaos: adnc: yes, but using a css selector is way simpler ... .class_of_your_right_content h5{margin:..;}
15:54  adnc: aterriblechaos, where do I add this?
15:54  aterriblechaos: in your css file
15:54  adnc: ahh I see
15:54  adnc: you do suggest to manipulate the h5 in my styles file?
15:54  adnc: sure, why not ;) thanks
15:54  aterriblechaos: yes thats what i do normally
15:55  aterriblechaos: sometimes it is way simpler to do changes in css than in typoscript
15:56  adnc: aterriblechaos, I would also like to have an image inserted into a marker field. maybe out of the resources secton of the page. could you point me to a documentation or a codesnipped?
15:57  aterriblechaos: adnc: http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/general-config/image-from-media-field.html
15:57  adnc: thank you
15:58  adnc: aterriblechaos, and how do I handle different sizes of those images? can t3 resize them?=
15:59  aterriblechaos: yes, just adjust file.width and file.height
15:59  adnc: cool
15:59  adnc: those are the sizes t3 will create the images , nice
16:00 * Bejjan heats up his amplifier
16:00  adnc: aterriblechaos, can i have inside this definition a class wrapped?
16:00  Bejjan: neighbours playing music so loud my chair is shaking
16:01  adnc: since I format the images and position them with my own class
16:01  aterriblechaos: yes, you should check tsref image (http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/references/doc_core_tsref/4.1.0/view/8/6/), params=class="myclass"
16:03  adnc: thanks
16:17  adnc: aterriblechaos, http://pastebin.com/Eg6tCfAL I did both but it doesnt add my class named screen to it, do you see any mistakes?
16:19  aterriblechaos: its TITELBILD.params=class.. , you need to set it on the IMAGE
16:22  adnc: it works wth TITELBILD.params=altText="SomeAlt Text" but not with TITELBILD.params=class="screen"
