10:57  iaj: lo there
10:57  iaj: how can I force typo to recreate the images that are usually stored in /uploads ??
10:58  biesior: iaj: you can't, they are just uploaded there...
10:59  biesior: iaj: they should be deleted automatically while deleting the record which contains 'em
10:59  iaj: biesior: i just exchanged an image but it won't get updated on frontend :\
11:00  biesior: should it be resized by IM? or it displays in original size?
11:01  iaj: biesior: its inserted in a text element .. and I kept its original size.
11:03  biesior: laj: click with the RMB on the image in FE and tell me what's its path exactly 
11:03  iaj: ooh ... thanks its working now... dunno what was wrong - seems to be a browser issue
11:06  pgampe: iaj: caching maybe ;)
11:06  iaj: pgampe: seems alike :\
11:06  iaj: even tho I tend to use SHIFT_R on my firefox every time
11:10  biesior: laj: RPM on image, then 'Show the image' (or something) and then try to hardrefresh... optionaly open in other browser and check if there also old image is used
11:19  iaj: ahh.. thanks that's a good way to check :)
11:19  iaj: ^ biesior 
11:21  soee: whats the best extension to use with tt_news as comments module ?
11:23  johnsonb: hello, does anyone know how to permanently redirect the old url of a page to the new RealUrl generated typo3 urls?
11:23  aterriblechaos: soee: i use comments, works fine ..
11:23  johnsonb: ap_arecht_uestd.htm -> /page/
11:23  johnsonb: i found the redirect section in realurl but there i have to set the realurl path of the page instead of the page id
11:24  johnsonb: when i do that i have to check the redirects very often eg. when the page got renamed
11:26  soee: aterriblechaos: yeah but its a bit to old i think, last version april 09
11:29  biesior: soee: so what? It's Dmitry's ext, which is mean that it will be working for a long time yet, BTW I also think it's best option now
11:35  HardPhuck: i agree
11:35  HardPhuck: and comments are not exactly rocket science so it's not a problem if not updated every month :)
11:37  iaj: i got a task to achieve.... i need to put a jquery fragment on a page.. well a h3 tag that should slidetoggle that is (with the h3 text and the text below the h3 that should toggle up and down)... and to make it easy to add that thing (entering the header and the text) for redacteurs
11:37  iaj: i hope that's understandable somehow ;-)
11:37  soee: HardPhuck: is there option to display total comments for single post in listview ?
11:38  HardPhuck: i don't know, didn't use it for quite some time
11:38  HardPhuck: what does the doc say?
11:39  biesior: soee: look to the manual ;> page no. 8
11:40  soee: yeah i see it now :)
11:41  soee: iaj maybe vreate fce if you are using TV
11:41  iaj: soee: im not using TemplaVoila - if that is what TV stands for.
11:41  iaj: fce is what tho?:)
11:41  HardPhuck: flexible content element
11:41  soee: flexible content element
11:41  soee: :]
11:42  pgampe: iaj: have a look into extension list
11:43  pgampe: iaj: e.g. jfmulticontent
11:44  iaj: soee: is there any documentation about that flexible content element? :-)
11:44  HardPhuck: yes
11:44  HardPhuck: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_ftb1/1.0.1/view/
11:44  HardPhuck: a bit old but still valid
11:47  soee: iaj: ypu can also watch some simple tutotrial here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqj0smQjJ3U
11:47  soee: *you
11:47  biesior: iaj: FCE it's TemplaVoila's part IMHO, if you aren't gonna switch to TV it will be much better option to create own extension with only one small FE plugin, containing two fields - header and content (in flexform), the editor just could put it on the column, fill and that's all
11:50  iaj: biesior: yeh I thought that's the way I got to chose however I never created an extension so far.. so I'd have to create one from scratch... biesior do you have an example of anything like that
11:50  iaj: soee: HardPhuck: thanks... gonna take a look now
11:53  biesior: iaj: get the SVN version of the kickstarter - (repo version is little bit TOO old) - https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Extensions/kickstarter/trunk/ first you will have to set some key, and later  you will create new ext in click-by-click way 
12:05 --- soee_ is now known as soee
12:23 --- dokma is now known as dokmatmp
12:35  tmpdkm: .
12:36 --- tmpdkm is now known as dokma
12:45  HardPhuck: dokma, you finished the scam site? :)
12:45  dokma: nope... it's a biggy
12:45  dokma: few more weeks of work left
12:45  dokma: what you doin?
12:46  HardPhuck: @work, implementing mm_forum in some site
13:13  HardPhuck: damn, can't create a special menu of topics
13:20  HardPhuck: oh well, typoscript to the rescue! :)
13:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#typo3 +o ries]
14:00  soee: can i set somehow tt_new sto display news latest 5 recorder and on the other page records from 5..x ?
14:01  HardPhuck: yes
14:03  soee: HardPhuck: can you tell me how exactly ?
14:06  HardPhuck: http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/De:TSref/RECORDS
14:06  HardPhuck: define a content (type plugin) on a page, set what you need to set then dispalay it on other page like described in the link above
14:27  iaj: one question - when I want to upgrade typo 4.1 to the most recent version - could I just export the current TYPO tree.. (in order something goes wrong) and then... mh.. is there a simple way to upgrade?
14:28  HardPhuck: there is
14:28  HardPhuck: make a dump of the database and files
14:28  HardPhuck: compress it and save it somewhere
14:28  HardPhuck: then remove typo3_src
14:29  HardPhuck: and make a symlink to 4.2
14:29  HardPhuck: install tool -> upgrade wizard
14:29  HardPhuck: then remove symlink to 4.2 and create one to 4.3 ,... rinse and repeat
14:29  HardPhuck: at the end, update extensions in ext manager
14:29  iaj: HardPhuck: how can i make a dump of the database when I don't have access to the mysql command on the commandline when SSH'd ?
14:30  HardPhuck: you don't?
14:30  iaj: nope :(
14:30  HardPhuck: ask admin to make a dump for you then
14:30  HardPhuck: you could export it with phpmyadmin as well
14:35  biesior: iaj: create new empty DB and use phpMyAdmin to save the backup copy
14:37  iaj: I tried exporting with phpmyadmin but I get a 'cant find file export.php'
14:38  iaj: and I don't have any privileges to create a new database:(
14:38  Bejjan: iaj: there is one more way , _IF_ you are allowed to run mysql command via exec/system you can make a phpscript to generate the dump
14:38  HardPhuck: iaj: get yourself a new hosting provider then :)
14:38  biesior: can you execute system() or exec()?
14:39  biesior: ach Bejjan was first ;)
14:39  iaj: Bejjan: yeah I could do that I think.
14:42  biesior: iaj: HardPhuck is right - there's a millions of providers who allows you to do much more with account which you are paying for, SSH improves TYPO3 development veeery much...
14:46  soee: if i instert CATMENU on my page i have list of categories and a header in this menu like "Select category" - can i somehow get rid of it?
14:46  soee: *tt_news
14:46  HardPhuck: yes, edit the template
14:46  iaj: biesior: yeh... can you guys recommen some good hosting systems?
14:46  iaj: espc. fast?
14:46  HardPhuck: i use hetzner.de
14:47  iaj: with that typo3 install tool?
14:47  iaj: i used that once.. but without ssh access.
14:47  biesior: I'm using hetzner as well (via local sub-provider)
14:48  soee: HardPhuck: are you sure that there is template for catmenu ?
14:50  HardPhuck: no
14:52  HardPhuck: http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/tt_news/current/info/pi%252Fstatic%252Fts_new%252Fsetup.txt/
14:52  HardPhuck: search for catmenu to see the default settings
14:52  HardPhuck: then override them
14:56  iaj: ok so im gonna chose hetzner as well :-) soon..
15:05  HardPhuck: ograje-komar.si <- this one is on hetzner
15:06  HardPhuck: but i have a dedi, not vps
15:07  biesior: HardPhuck: does they allow SSH access on shared accounts?
15:07  soee: HardPhuck: what gallery did you used on this page ?
15:07  HardPhuck: soee: chgallery and prettyPhoto
15:07  HardPhuck: biesior: i don't think they have shared hosting (not sure though)
15:08  fruchthoernschen: ries: Have you use eclipse for TYPO3 developing?
15:11  soee: HardPhuck: chgallery works with ajax ?
15:11  HardPhuck: ajax? there is no ajax here
15:11  ironm: Hi Serpiente and SargoDarya 
15:11  Serpiente: hey
15:11  Serpiente: long time no see
15:12  ironm: Guys - I need a recommandation for a custommers reference list (a kind of photo-gallery but with some additional fields for text)- thanks in advance for any hints ;)
15:13  HardPhuck: templavoila ;)
15:13  ironm: hi harrd
15:13  HardPhuck: hey
15:13  ironm: hi HardPhuck  .. TV .. not really ;)
15:13  HardPhuck: why not?
15:14  HardPhuck: you can define custom fields and image alongside
15:14  ironm: there are some gallery like solutions... 
15:14  HardPhuck: you could use chgallery which allows you to append info.txt file inside the folder and displays contents of that folder in FE
15:15  HardPhuck: but i'm not sure if html is allowed
15:16  ironm: thanks for your hint HardPhuck :)
15:16  HardPhuck: sure
15:16  HardPhuck: how many images per reference are they expecting?
15:31  ironm: HardPhuck, one main picture and few sub-pictures (if you follow more ... )
15:31  HardPhuck: then tt_news is flexible enough as well methinks
15:32  ironm: hmm ... methinks?
15:33  HardPhuck: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=methinks
15:33  HardPhuck: :)
15:33  ironm: merci HardPhuck :)
15:33  HardPhuck: np :)
15:37  iaj: is it worth getting the hang of TV?
15:37  iaj: all the additional stuff is possible with custom extensions as well, isn't it?
15:37  HardPhuck: yes, TV is a life saver
15:37  HardPhuck: the swiss knife of templating
15:39  HardPhuck: why use custom extensions when you can have one extension doing all the work?
15:39 * HardPhuck finds it funny that some developers use extensions for trivial stuff like adding google analytics and lighboxes
15:39  biesior: HardPhuck: because FCE can not do everything ? ;)
15:40  HardPhuck: well yes, but in my experience it can be used as a proper solution in 90% of presentational problems
15:41  cervera: Hello evryone
15:42  cervera: Anyone knows how to add a class to an IMAGE object in TS?
15:43  HardPhuck: params?
15:43  HardPhuck: 10 = IMAGE
15:43  HardPhuck: 10.params = class="cl"
15:44  ndee: hey gang, would you recommend encrypting per default a site?
15:44  HardPhuck: encrypting what?
15:44  ndee: HardPhuck, https per default
15:44  ndee: for the whole site
15:45  HardPhuck: of course not
15:45  cervera: Thank you HardPhuck!
15:45  ndee: why "of course" not?
15:45  HardPhuck: because it's processor intensive
15:45  ndee: you can buy cars on that website
15:45  ndee: ah
15:45  HardPhuck: and it's usually not worth securing the information
15:46  ndee: as soon as they are logged in, everything is encrypted anyway, so I was wondering if it would make sense to encrypt everything per default
15:46  ndee: do you know how much of a performance hit it is?
15:46  HardPhuck: if the traffic is heavy then it may slow your server alot
15:47  ndee: http://serverfault.com/questions/43692/how-much-of-a-performance-hit-for-https-vs-http-for-apache <-- jup, looks like it :D
15:48  HardPhuck: now you know why 'of course not' :)
15:48  ndee: :D
15:58  HardPhuck: job done for me, going home :)
15:58  HardPhuck: later
16:02  derAui: Hallo, ich habe vor, auf einer Typo3 Seite meinen dynamischen Inhalt in extensions auszulagern. Dafür würde ich gerne den extension kickstarter verwenden. Allerdings sind dort die Standardausgaben unschön im php der main klasse eingebettet, deshalb habe ich die smarty extension installiert. Kennt jemand eine Seite, auf der erklärt wird, wie man eine extension mit smarty baut? oder gibt es einen noch besseren Weg, über den ich bisher
16:03  derAui: oh sorry
16:03  derAui: english :/
16:04  biesior: derAui: did you try 'smarty' extension ?
16:05  biesior: it's documented
16:05  derAui: in the smarty extension documentation?
16:05  biesior: As far as I remeber... isn't it?
16:05  derAui: i'll have a look. thanks
16:06  biesior: there're samples for PHP code, as also for smarty templates
16:30  iaj: is there a nice manual for getting the hang of TV?
16:38 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
16:45  derAui: Hi. i've got me the smarty_demo installed, (smarty is already there), but if i try to get it running, he says that smarty isn't found under the install path EXT:smarty/Smarty-<some version>. But it is stored in the filesystem under typo3conf/ext/smarty and the path in the configuration (if i go to extension manager -> install extension -> Smarty templating engine), is set to EXT:smarty/Smarty. 
16:45  derAui: and he still doesnt find it
16:46  derAui: is that wrong oder is there maybe another way do change this path that overwrites my settings?
16:58  snoy_ms: derAui: When you use Extbase as startpoint you get fluid as template engine. I think thats a better way to start
16:58  derAui: thanks, i've got it. you have to explicitely set a checkbox that you have the right path.
16:59  derAui: snoy_ms: thanks, but i already have some experience in web development with smarty... and why break with old habits
