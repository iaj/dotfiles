06:19  FloLeBlanc: gooooooood morning typo3
07:48  FloLeBlanc: wow this extbase_kickstarter is really cool
08:20  HardPhuck: FloLeBlanc: you're early today :)
08:21  FloLeBlanc: HardPhuck: I'm here sice 06:19 - fell asleep by accident yesterday at 23:00 ;)
08:21  HardPhuck: lol
08:21  FloLeBlanc: And I'm intrigued by extbase/fluid and the extbase_kickstarter... this seems like very good work
08:21  FloLeBlanc: currently trying to get a mini-plugin up and running
08:22  HardPhuck: you're having fun... i'm doing the grunt work atm... moving some old typo3 sites from the old server and upgrading them to latest versions, and converting the databases to utf8
08:24  FloLeBlanc: HardPhuck: feeling sorry for you :(
08:25  FloLeBlanc: I'm glad I can sneak my personal sneak peak at extbase extensions in as a "required mini plugin for our webpage" :)
08:25  HardPhuck: :)
08:25  HardPhuck: i'll get there :)
08:25  HardPhuck: i even had to update some sites from 3.8.1 to 4.4.5 :)
08:25  FloLeBlanc: on the other hand I don't know how many people apart from IT guys actually enjoy digging and learning things the hard way hehe
08:25  HardPhuck: nightmare
08:26  FloLeBlanc: what we call "I have fun developing fluid extensions" would be the hell for some other ppl
08:26  FloLeBlanc: oh yeah 3.8.1 to 4.4.5... brrr... no sr_feuser_register I hope for you?
08:28  HardPhuck: no :) i think sr_feuser_register didn't even exist when those sites were made lol
08:29  FloLeBlanc: it did
08:29  FloLeBlanc: I used it back then
08:30  HardPhuck: okay, then i'm lucky, none had it, mostly presentatinal websites :)
08:30  FloLeBlanc: and I HAD to take it with me to 4.4.5 :) (with a custom extension for sms confirmation to confirm your registration that is)
08:30  FloLeBlanc: what really drove me mad is that they just changed all hooks in a minor version update
08:30  FloLeBlanc: *rips out his last hair*
08:31  FloLeBlanc: I wonder what will happen when phoenix gets released
08:31  FloLeBlanc: does anyone know if it will still support the old extensions?
08:31  FloLeBlanc: or will receive 4.X major support for upcoming years?
08:33  FloLeBlanc: hi PiMB
08:34  FloLeBlanc: bye pimb
08:58  HardPhuck: lol
08:59  HardPhuck: FloLeBlanc: phoenix will support old extensions only if those are build with extbase/fluid
09:00  FloLeBlanc: HardPhuck: urgs
09:01  FloLeBlanc: well.. understandable but.... urgs :)
09:01  HardPhuck: 4.6 is coming with a long term support
09:01  HardPhuck: so you'll be able to use old extensions with that for quite some time
09:02  FloLeBlanc: whew, glad to hear

09:42  FloLeBlanc: soee: never experienced that
09:43  FloLeBlanc: perhaps some relations that would involve joins on the database side?
09:43  soee: FloLeBlanc: its not the first time i have this problem, and i think its related to extensions fields only
09:44  FloLeBlanc: I could imagine some scenario with fe_users & tt_address that could cause problems. I had those with the BE forms because of the joins the user display involves
09:44  soee: now i cant select some a lot o fields related with t3blog
09:45  soee: im using only t3blog/templavoila/realurl extra extensions :)
09:51  soee: FloLeBlanc: whats the best way/solution to create multilanguage page?
09:52  FloLeBlanc: there are some tutorials on that. I'd go for creating an additional language in your root node and then add translations for the content elements
10:00  FloLeBlanc: Someone in who knows how to create extensions with extbase?
10:05  soee: FloLeBlanc: im lokking @ some tutorial @ mulilanguage, but i have one question if i want to have 2 languages - polish and english do i have to create them both or there is already one by default created ?
10:06  FloLeBlanc: as I understand there is the default language which you set to some language (f.e.: polish) and then you add english but I may be wrong never implemented 2 languages myself yet
10:08  soee: yeah, so do i thats why im asking :)
10:12  MateMK4: soee: interesting topic, I'll have to do the same thing... let me know, if you figure out something interesting
10:13  soee: MateMK4: @ multilanguage ?
10:39  MateMK4: soee: have you read this?
10:39  MateMK4: http://typo3.org/documentation/tips-tricks/multi-language-sites-in-typo3/
10:56  soee: MateMK4: im doing this using: http://www.training-typo3.com/2008/12/15/typo3-multi-language/ and http://dmitry-dulepov.com/article/creating-multilanguage-sites-with-templavoila.html
11:00  MateMK4: soee thanks :)
11:07  MateMK4: thanks indeed, I was just figuring out how to get everything together.. and: This little tutorial explains it allâ€¦ what to put in typoscript, how to handle realurl and how you can get a language selector on each page. this is exactly what I need :)
11:11  zorzar_: hey, hey, can anybody help me getting single table inheritance in extbase?
11:11  FloLeBlanc: zorzar: I'm sitting here trying to RUN my extension at least so unfortunately.. not me :)
11:11  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: hehe
11:13  FloLeBlanc: zorzar: do you work with the extbase_kickstarter?
11:14  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: i used it to model my first models
11:15  FloLeBlanc: I'm a bit puzzled on how to integrate the plugin. the tutorial tells me to edit ext_tables.php and ext_localconf.php, but in ext_tables the kickstarter already did put in a bunch of things not mentioned in the manual :)
11:15  FloLeBlanc: I thought in "ext_tables.php" the line: t3lib_extMgm::addStaticFile($_EXTKEY, 'Configuration/TypoScript', 'Outlet Feature Listing'); adds my plugin, but the tutorial tells me to add Tx_Extbase_Utility_Extension::registerPlugin(...)
11:16  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: registerPlugin does register a plugin, which can be part of an extension
11:18  FloLeBlanc: sorry I'm puzzled, how do I get the extension created with the extbase_kickstarter installed then when register/configure plugin is not the issue
11:20  FloLeBlanc: the tutorial just tells me to "install the extension" but it isn't listed in my ext_manager, do I have to add it by hand?
11:20  FloLeBlanc: zorzar_: nevermind... fatal exception in User intelligence
11:27  Denyerek: soee
11:27  Denyerek: I just finished doing one of those.
11:27  Denyerek: It was only a simple English/Spanish site tho
11:27  soee: Denyerek: so you added only 1 extra languge ?
11:28  Denyerek: jup
11:29  soee: Denyerek: so if i want Poloish (default)/English i have to create only english and than configure both via TS ?
11:29  Denyerek: Yep
11:30  Denyerek: I used RealURL to vary the language based on the domain
11:30  Denyerek: so mySite.co.uk is English and mySite.es  is spanish
11:30  Denyerek: Just followed the two posts on Dmitry's blog and it worked out OK
11:31  soee: ok nice, i will use only one domain
11:32  soee: Denyerek: an let me ask - you are working on TV ?
11:40  Denyerek: Jep
11:46  FloLeBlanc: wow.. denyerek can be seen working on TV? which channel?
11:48  Denyerek: ;)
11:49  Denyerek: It's subscription only I'm afraid Flo ;)
11:49  FloLeBlanc: damn.. how much?
11:49  Denyerek: As much as you've got ;)
11:49  FloLeBlanc: all 67 cent?
11:49 * Denyerek wiggles suggestively
11:49  Denyerek: That'll do.
11:49  Denyerek: And let's not have anyone accuse me of being cheap
11:49  FloLeBlanc: but that's my whole lunch money
11:55  FloLeBlanc: zorzar_: can you please tell me how this works: I set relations in the extension kickstarter (like fridge and food in the example) but the only way I can add "food" to a "fridge" is by creating new food each time, I'd like to create 10 "foods" that I can put in one or more of the fridges
12:05  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: you can model both 1:1 and 1:n relations, what you want is a 1:n relation
12:06  FloLeBlanc: zorzar_: I did already model it like that in the kickstarter, the main problem I have is if I have an 1:n relation (one fridge can contain multiple goods) I do not want to recreate the food for each fridge (f.e.: 2 fridges can contain bananas)
12:06  FloLeBlanc: the list module however only offers me to "create" new goods when editing a fridge
12:07  FloLeBlanc: or would I have to create a  new action for that ("assign") myself?
12:07  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: yeah i think you need your own action
12:08  FloLeBlanc: zorzar_:thank you
12:08  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: or you make the 1:n relation a n:m with a helper table and add a count to that helper table
12:08  zorzar_: FloLeBlanc: I'm not sure what you want to model in the end
12:10  FloLeBlanc: the fridge example: I want to have 10 goods (bananas, oranges, apples, etc.) and multiple fridges. each fridge (1, 2, 3) should be able to have some of the goods in it
12:10  FloLeBlanc: currently I have "fridge" with 1:n and "food" (both with list, edit and create actions)

12:36  yogg: If I try to generate an pdf I get "PHP : Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated in ..."    thats beacause of the fact that php5 gives now back all objects as reference by default
12:37  yogg: is there new version or a patch for "pdf_generator2" out there?
12:38  yogg: pdf_creator2  does things like this:
12:38  yogg: $field =& new PDFFieldSelect..    but it should be doen now this way:  $field = new PDFFieldSelect...
12:42  soee: never used pdf_generator2 :/
12:48  No5251: yogg: it's an E_STRICT message, add E_DEPRECATED to your error levels
12:49  zorzar_: hmmm i try to add some javascript to my backendmodule using $this->response->addAdditionalHeaders() but it isn't available in the backend
13:14  soee_: need some answer @ TV
13:14  soee_: is is possible to create template grid in the BE exactly the same as my theme has ?
13:15  soee_: this grid = template object
13:18  HardPhuck: soee_: yes
13:19  Denyerek: In TV?
13:19  Denyerek: Yes
13:19  Denyerek: you can define some simple HTML Table layout as part of your DS
13:19  HardPhuck: and complex too :)
13:19  soee_: Denyerek: how exactly ?
13:20 * Denyerek is allergic to complex
13:20  Denyerek: You edit the template record and look for uhm

13:22  HardPhuck: ah okay, my bad then

21:15  soee: yeah, but i have to implement blog for a client :)
21:16  soee: and as i see this one is most popular 
21:19  ries: soee: that's not the one based on tt_news, right?
21:19  soee: ries: no this one is "special" its not created like other extensions :/
21:20  ries: I have tried it myself, it works but found it very hard to customize it because of the gazillions lines of typoscript
21:20  soee: yeah, thats the problem
21:21  ries: if your client is flexible, I would ask him if it's ok to install Wordpress, some clients don't care.. others do..
21:21  ries: but Wordpress rocks in comparison to TYPO3
21:21  soee: yes i know but he wants blog inside website
21:23  HardPhuck: a full blog?
21:23  HardPhuck: with tracbacks and pingbacks

21:39  mightyrox: hello
21:40  soee: yo
21:40  mightyrox: IÂ´ve got a problem with t3 and gd2 .. IÂ´ve installed a new liveserver with debian lenny, php5, libgd2, imagemagick, etc .. but t3 says: GD library is too old. Version 2.0.1 or later is required, and 2.0.28 is strongly recommended. dpkg -l |grep gd2 says: 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-3+lenny1 .. what can I do? .. 
21:44  HardPhuck: remove libgd2
21:44  HardPhuck: and install gd as php extension
21:45  mightyrox: mh ok.. I`ll try that
21:45  HardPhuck: apt-get install php5-gd
21:47  mightyrox: but, if I say apt-get install php5-gd . libgd2-xpm will be installed automaticly too
21:47  HardPhuck:  so? :)
21:48  mightyrox: mh.. I give it a try :)
21:49  mightyrox: same problem
21:51  ries: mightyrox: you do need php5-gd for sure, as far as I know, php5-gd is linked to libgd2
21:51  mightyrox: yes and both are installed .. php5-gd, php5-imagick, libgd2-xpm
21:52  mightyrox: and libgd-tools
21:52  HardPhuck: i have zend server ce on my lenny
21:52  HardPhuck: works fine
21:52  ries: your command for checking teh version only applies to libgd2 though
21:52  HardPhuck: and comes with everythin but the database
21:53  ries: mightyrox: do you have libgd2-xpm installed?
21:53  mightyrox: yes
21:54  mightyrox: every graphics works find except png .. it seems that that gd2 version doesnÂ´t support png format
21:56  ries: do you have libpng12-0 installed?
21:57  mightyrox: I have libpng3 version installed
21:59  ries: can yo try to install libpng12-0 ?
21:59  mightyrox: ok
21:59  ries: I didn't had libpng3 installed at all..
21:59  mightyrox: libpng12-0 is already the newest version.
22:02  ries: Hmmm
22:03  soee: mightyrox: whats wrong with png on your site ?
22:05  HardPhuck: mightyrox: when you get tired of wasting time over finding why it doesn't work, try Zend Server CE :)
22:07  mightyrox: itÂ´s curious .. I have png files in the template that works fine, and I have some extensions which uses php imagick magic stuff but doesn`t show the returning png .. maybe it`s more a problem of the extension than by the installed lib versions...
22:08  mightyrox: HardPhuck: I do not have the time to install a Zend Server ;-) .. this must work today ;-)
22:08  HardPhuck: it's a matter of minutes :)
22:08  HardPhuck: you install it with apt-get
22:09  HardPhuck: comes with preconfigured php, apache ...
22:09  mightyrox: mh .. 
22:09  HardPhuck: and if you want good mysql replacement, try percona server (which is also installed with apt-get)
22:10  HardPhuck: (and it is fully compatible with mysql, only it works faster)
22:10  ries: HardPhuck: why would anybody try Zend Server CE if I may ask....I am not familiar with that product
22:10  mightyrox: ok .. I need more time ;-)
22:11  HardPhuck: ries, because it's the most reliable source of latest php versions, which are not included in debian stable yet
22:12  HardPhuck: and it has php preconfigured with common extensions one would need
22:12  ries: HardPhuck: ic... so it's not a vendor locking, you can always move away again?
22:12  HardPhuck: ries yes
22:12  ries: HardPhuck: I don't have percona in apt though...
22:13  HardPhuck: yeah you need to go to their website to include their repo
22:13  HardPhuck: http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/repositories:apt
22:13  mightyrox: will that zend server replace my current configuration?
22:14  HardPhuck: mightyrox: yes, you might want to back it up
22:14  HardPhuck: ries, I've installed lighttpd in front of apache (as reverse proxy) to serve static files
22:14  ries: HardPhuck: percona is interesting... finally somebody that realizes that MySQL is just dip-shit-slow
22:14  ries: and does something about that
22:15  HardPhuck: yea, and the team behind it have some members that were original mysql designers
22:16  HardPhuck: mysqlperformanceblog.com is theirs
22:16  mightyrox: what do you think about maria-db ? 
22:16  ries: mightyrox: nothing...
22:16  ries: just a kid on the block
22:19  HardPhuck: kobilje.si this site is on the server with percona
22:19  HardPhuck: serves pretty fast, at least here :)
22:22  ries: HardPhuck: thanks for the pointers... always good to know
22:23  HardPhuck: sure no problem :)
22:23  ries: I never used MySQL for heavy stuff, so I cannot really tell
22:23  ries: but if it's a easly replacement, why not...
22:23  ries: at least I don't have to say I am using MySQL anymore :D
22:23  mightyrox: we use mysql for heavy stuff and it works fine ;-)
22:23  HardPhuck: yeah :)
22:24  HardPhuck: it really was easy to install,.. added the repo, apt-get install... and even preserved my old databases and everything
22:26  HardPhuck: but i have yet to do any proper benchmarking on it :)
22:26  ries: mightyrox: I always had issues with subqueries and joining many tables.... mayor issue is that it cannot use bitmap indexes
22:26  HardPhuck: ries, then try mongoDV
22:27  HardPhuck: mongoDB
