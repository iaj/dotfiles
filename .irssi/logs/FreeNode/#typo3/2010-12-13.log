10:27  MarcelT3_: while this might be slighty offtopic it concers mostly my #TYPO3 channel experience >> how do you suppress join/leaving messages in a channel w/o conference mode?
10:27  HardPhuck: depends on your client

10:28  MarcelT3: well, chatzilla doesn t seem to have something like this
10:28  MarcelT3: what do you use i.e.?
10:32  javivf: morning
10:32  danslo: mornin! 
10:33  danslo: can I somehow output the SQL query generated by a CONTENT block? Im trying to debug something 
10:35  HardPhuck: MarcelT3: http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus
10:35  HardPhuck: danslo open admin panel in FE
10:35  HardPhuck: you can see queries there
10:37  MarcelT3: thx for the info HardPhuck 
10:37  HardPhuck: np
10:45  danslo: HardPhuck: interestingly, I cannot find the query there
10:45  HardPhuck: it should be there
10:45  MarcelT3: danslo: try setting [SYS][sqlDebug] = 1
10:46  MarcelT3: in localconf.php resp. in the install tool > all config
10:46  danslo: MarcelT3: where would it write the sql logs to?
10:47  MarcelT3: if your ip matches the developer ip it will spam your frontend full with sql explanations
10:47  danslo: MarcelT3: the things is, I have as bunch of SQL queries... just not the one from my TS plugin
10:47  danslo: thing*
10:48  MarcelT3: well, i only know how to get all sql statements. so you already see sql debug output in your browser?
10:49  danslo: MarcelT3: yep
10:50  MarcelT3: and in your extension you use the T3 functions for db queries? <- if so, then i bet your queries are not executed at all
10:50  HardPhuck: make a syntax error in the query :D
10:51  HardPhuck: it's usually a fast way of debugigng :)
10:51  danslo: HardPhuck: I do that with pibase plugins, but does it work for TS? (CONTENT element with select statement)
10:52  HardPhuck: not sure, try a table name of nonexistant table
10:55  danslo: doesn really seem to work for TS
10:56  HardPhuck: i guess it supresses errors
11:15  randomresult: good morning 
11:17  randomresult: anyone around? 
11:17  randomresult: i want to create the following menue: http://pastebin.com/RSDEgZ28
11:17  randomresult: any ideas on how? 
11:19  HardPhuck: yes, start by makind a textmenu first
11:19  HardPhuck: then replace text with images using CSS
11:20  randomresult: hmmm... does not work... i need the images where i posted it
11:20  randomresult: want to make a jquery menu 
11:21  randomresult: well aktually placing an image into the first container... should be easy... but two? 
11:22  randomresult: @HardPhuck : http://pastebin.com/7tCZSSvc
11:22  randomresult: found this 
11:22  HardPhuck: never used gifbuilder
11:22  HardPhuck: it's a bad idea imho
11:23  randomresult: well.. i dont need that gmenu... if it is possible to place the image within a TMENU
11:24  randomresult: aktually the images
11:26  HardPhuck: it is
11:29  randomresult: just a sec
11:31  andylockran: hey guys - trying to enable user-registration upon purchase for tt_products - is this a template change, or typoscript?
11:32  randomresult: HardPhuck: u could show me how?
11:32  randomresult: i mean the images placed in the resources of the page
11:34  HardPhuck: http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/menus/tabsmenu-tmenu-sample.html
11:36  randomresult: well they use defined images (constants)
11:38  HardPhuck: http://www.mcuniverse.com/archive/TMENU-with-before-Image.1372.0.html
11:39  HardPhuck: i don't have exact example
11:39  HardPhuck: i think you have get it out of these examples
11:39  HardPhuck: have = can
11:40  randomresult: see privat message
11:52  andylockran: for future refrence, front end users reg is as easy as setting the PIDusersFolder and setting createUsers = 1 on the template constants of the root shop page.
12:20  daReaper: hi
12:20  daReaper: i added a listbox for my plugin as described on "http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/doc_core_api/4.1.0/view/4/1/#id4054841", but when I try to save it, it says the column doesn't exist. How do i get typo3 to create the column?

12:59  alice|wl: hello, I return some html in main() of my extension. For some reasons I get empty bold tags in the result. Any idea why and how to get rid of them? 
13:01  Avalarion: how to you return them to what and how do you print them?
13:03  Avalarion: I want to use 2 different PageTrees in one Typo3. So i said, that both "root"'s are root and added "Domain" Items like "www.page.tld" and "page.tld" for both roots. But I am not able to get the second one... Anyone an Idea?
13:04  alice|wl: the extensions is called as templa voila content element
13:05  Avalarion: then I am not able to help you, never used templa voila, sorry.
13:05  Avalarion: I solved my problem.
13:05  alice|wl: Avalarion: you dont need the root pages to be root pages :)
13:06  Avalarion: That was what I did. And I changed the Order they have got.
13:06  Avalarion: have had
13:06  Avalarion: -.- bad english
13:13  alice|wl: hmm, its empty lines that get replace with <b></b>
13:13  sorenmalling: Anyone here knows in what part of tsconfig to set "tt_content_showHidden" ? mod.something, setup.override ?
13:15  mourique: Hey y'all
13:15  mourique: i want tt_address to show a default image in FE if no image is selected. How is that possible?
13:21  alice|wl: :/ no, i was wrong ... removing empty lines did not help
13:30  smeringe: mourique: check plugin.tt_news.displayList.image.noImage_stdWrap (http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/tt_news/3.0.1/view/1/4/ - see under News Images)
13:32  smeringe: sorenmalling: are you thinking of the TCEDefaults.tt_content.xxx = yyy ?
13:33  sorenmalling: No, it was in mod.txtemplavoilaM1...... that the settings needed to be defined - found it with "Admin tools" -> "Configuration"
13:34  smeringe: ah, k.
13:34  sorenmalling: smeringe: After I defined it manually, I was able to search for it in the configuration array

14:19  MarcelT3: do you guys know of a clean way to take client´s cookie content into typoscript conditions?
14:20  PiMB: probably via your own php file exception?
14:21  MarcelT3: propably there´s no way round the userfunc condition... 
14:30  MarcelT3: or is there? --> [globalString = HTTP_COOKIE_VARS | authinitread = 1] :-)
15:05  hawkeye78_: hello
15:06  hawkeye78_: i have a little question about extensions
15:06  hawkeye78_: can output more than one field in a list in the backend
15:07  PiMB: what do you mean?
15:08  hawkeye78_: ok, maybe i should start at the beginning, i have create an extensions with 3 tables, one for personal information like firstname, surname, eMail etc.
15:08  hawkeye78_: and one for publications with the fields title, year etc.
15:09  ivaldi: hm, is there something like "deleteTree" but without deleting the current page (just all subpages and tt_content records (but no templates))
15:09  hawkeye78_: now can every staff member create a dataset with the name, eMail and which publications he has
15:09  hawkeye78_: but at the moment in the list in the backend the only can select the publications by the name
15:10  hawkeye78_: but i would fill the list with the title AND the year
15:10  hawkeye78_: did i have any chance to do this?
15:10  hawkeye78_: i have already look at the tca,php but i found nothing what fits
15:14  ivaldi: hawkeye78_ you can use "label_alt"
15:14  MarcelT3: ivaldi: dirty but quick > sql DELETE FROM pages, tt_content WHERE pid = {pageID of your page that should not be deleted} and after that you go lowlevel cleaner delete orphan files :D
15:15  hawkeye78_: ivaldi, thanks i will take a look
15:16  ivaldi: ;) @ MarcelT3 - okay, so i'll select all subpages and call a "deleteTree"-cmd on each one ;)
15:16  MarcelT3: more likely, yes :)
15:17 * MarcelT3 was assuming a page with 100+ children ^^
15:18  ivaldi: right, but i have to regard workspaces -> use the api ;)
15:19  MarcelT3: better do so
15:41  Denyerek: HardPhuck: Why stop at 4.1? :D
15:41  HardPhuck: old extensions
15:41  HardPhuck: custom ones
15:41  HardPhuck: will break installation if i upgrade further
15:57  douglasb: i have a templavoila question...what "Element Preset" do I choose for use with "AT", an attribute in the mapping setting dropdown?
16:17  ndee: anyone knows an extension which offers an obfuscated download of files for tt_news? For example, that hotlinking is not possible.
16:23  MarcelT3: maybe the good old EXT:naw_securedl fits for your problem
16:42  ndee: guess i have to play around a little bit :D
