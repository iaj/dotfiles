16:46  kggle_: is there a posibility to check a value after that its submitted ( default mailform plugin typo3 ), thanks
16:51  evilness: konkurs 2010 i/9.1.1/a/10 link wiecej
16:51  evilness: sorry;)
16:53  snoy_ms: kggle_: maybe this (Special evaluation)? http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/references/doc_core_tsref/4.1.0/view/8/20/#id3658875
16:54  kggle_: no, this is done with the js check
16:54  kggle_: im currently writing a dynamic captcha extension
16:55  kggle_: but i have also to check for a input after submit (because of no js)
16:55  kggle_: this sucks! :)
16:57  snoy_ms: kggle_: mhh, in 4.5 it will be completly done with the new mail class
16:58  kggle_: snoy_ms, what do you mean with "completly done" ?
16:59  snoy_ms: kggle_: mhh, good question.... I just want to say (as far as i know) that 4.5 will use the new classes within t3lib/mail.
16:59  kggle_: ok.
16:59  snoy_ms: kggle_: if you write an extension, maybe this is importend to know
16:59  kggle_: thanks, i wil have a look ;)
17:00  snoy_ms: https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/trunk/t3lib/mail/
17:00  kggle_: but this is very annoying, i wanted to write a captcha that is compatible with almost every top mailform pluings :/
17:00  kggle_: and the default is making me cry :/
17:01  snoy_ms: kggle_: Maybe its just the way how it sends the mails. It could be still the same way to hook into this...
17:01  snoy_ms: kggle_: don't know, just want to mention this
17:01  kggle_: ok, i will check the docs, thanks!

19:30  iaj: is is sufficent to save fileadmin/ uploads/ and typo3conf    and its database if I want to move my typo3 stuff to another domain?
19:36  MyGoddess: iaj, well, if you put the same source or juste minor revision difference, it should be ok. But check anyway.
20:41  derape: Hey, is there a way to put TSFE parameters in a PHP_SCRIPT file in typo-script? Tried "myParameter = TSFE:foo" but the Parameter isn't passed, I just get "TESFE:foo" as string
20:42  derape: "foo" is ofc a real parameter
