11:15  Olf_: hello
11:16  Denyerek: morgen
11:16  Olf_: a question about FCE's n templavoila, what do you guys think, is it somehow possible to hide FCE header field for BE user and/or make it filled with preset value and non editable?
12:06  SargoDarya_: Yo guys, short question. I have an extension with records and the records have usergroups assigned. Is there a convenient Typo3 method to check if a given FE User has access to that record?
12:08  Denyerek: Olf_ I think there's a new option in the latest TV about whether or not to include the header.
12:09  Denyerek: Check the settings in the extension manager.
12:09  Denyerek: Hiding the field I think would be a case of hiding it in the TCE but I have no real idea.
12:16  SargoDarya_: alright found it. It was $this->cObj->enableFields();
12:39  EmilioTucci: Hi all
12:39  EmilioTucci: anyway to stop google indexing folders into my fileadmin directory?
12:40  EmilioTucci: Useres are posting CVs that are stored there in PDF format, so they are indexed and show up in google search, which is dangerouts
12:40  EmilioTucci: any clue?
12:40  EmilioTucci: robot.txt maybe?
12:42  pgampe: or htaccess + nas_securedl or whatever the extension is called
12:42  EmilioTucci: will robot.txt work?
12:42  EmilioTucci: in  my root folder or just into the fileadmin folder?
12:44  pgampe: in the root folder... if will work for google, but not for bad guys
12:44  pgampe: it must be example.org/robots.txt
12:44  pgampe: use google webmaster tools, they help a lot ;)
12:44  EmilioTucci: I did it
12:44  EmilioTucci: User-agent: *
12:44  EmilioTucci: Disallow: /fileadmin/cvs
12:44  EmilioTucci: Not sure if this will suffice
12:46  pgampe: should
12:49  danslo2: I would definitely use htaccess over robots in this case...
12:50  pgampe: Extension: naw_securedl is a must (!)
13:46  soee: hi
13:47  soee: guys is it possible to generate inside extension image with rounded corners ?
13:48  pgampe: I would use CSS3 ;) but you could use TYPO3's image generation feature to add corner images to each image
13:48  pgampe: should be possible with pure TS, but PHP might be easier
14:44  saedelaere: hi
14:45  saedelaere: i deactivated all kind of pagecontent elements for a sysfolder. 
14:45  saedelaere: when the user selects New pagecontent the list is empty but he can still click on "Select position:"
14:46  saedelaere: then a new pagecontent will be added and he can choose between textbox and record. how can I prevent this?
14:48  saedelaere: itried
14:48  saedelaere: mod.SHARED.colPos_list = ""
14:48  saedelaere: but still "normal" is displayed
14:48  saedelaere: best thing would be to remove this "Select position:" completely inside this folder, but I don't know how.
14:55  pgampe: AFAIK you can't
15:12  saedelaere: pgampe, ok thank you!
15:46  pgampe: Well, I searched once, but I did not find a solution either :(
16:03  ndee: hey ladies
16:04  ndee: question: as far as I can see, it's not possible to set permissions on a db-field for FE-Users. How would you guys do that?
16:23  af_: how can I write an external http link in a item of bullet lits?
16:28  pgampe: use RTE
16:28  pgampe: or custem TS rendering
