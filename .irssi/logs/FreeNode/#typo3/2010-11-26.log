15:26  iaj: does someone know of a plugin for mail forms that supports something a fashion of double-opt in?
15:27  pharno: can someone tell me why my page is showing up twice?
15:27  pharno: http://pharno.web11.wmc.ch/index.php?id=8
15:27  pharno: this happens since I changed my typoscript
15:27  pharno: http://nopaste.info/098082c8ba.html
15:34  pharno: noone?
15:40  sorenmalling: pharno: Check if you got two page objects with typeNum = 0 in your object browser
15:40  eduardo: pharno: are you using templavoila or just pure typoscript?
15:40  pharno: im using templavoila
15:41  pharno: sorenmalling: second
15:41  pharno: hm

15:53  GaiusOctavius: I want to change an existing typo3 installation. In this installation the headlines get rendered as image, is this an extention or a core feature?
15:53  GaiusOctavius: And where can I find it?
15:55  pharno: [Fri Nov 26 15:50:10 2010] [crit] [client 192.168.100.254] (13)Permission denied: /home/pharno/public_html/typo3conf/ext/t3mootools/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable, referer: http://pharno.web11.wmc.ch/typo3/backend.php
15:55  pharno: I get this all the time...
15:55  pharno: the folder is readable...
15:55  sorenmalling: it doesn't say a thing about folder :) 
15:55  pharno: the folder and all its content *
15:56  sorenmalling: Did you google the error message? It's related to server setup and htaccess and not typo3
15:56  pharno: yeah, I've googled it
15:57  pharno: all tuts/fixes/whatever tell me something about permissions...
15:57  pharno: but the file doesnt even exist
15:57  pharno: when I create it, it is ignored
16:03  pharno: hm
16:03  pharno: chmod 777 solved the problem...
16:15  Xilent: pharno: doh :)
16:15  danielawaranie: hi all
16:15  pharno: Xilent: ?
16:15  pharno: hi danielawaranie
16:16  danielawaranie: is that not possible:
16:16  danielawaranie: config.baseURL=USER_INT
16:16  danielawaranie: config.baseURL.includeLibs=fileadmin/user_getSubdomainBaseUrl.php
16:16  danielawaranie: config.baseURL.userFunc=user_getSubdomainBaseUrl->main
16:16  danielawaranie: ?
16:17  iaj: lo there :)
16:18  iaj: anyone can recommen me a nice german server for hosting my new typo3 site?
16:19  FloLeBlanc: iaj: sorry don't know one - mine is in austria but doesn't generally offer t3 hosting :)
16:19  iaj: FloLeBlanc: hmmm yeah... well I have a customer at "1und1" and am pretty disappointed - not even shell access.
16:19  iaj: so I need a good find now :)
16:20  FloLeBlanc: iaj: yeah.. I checked that one out for a customer once and wasn't very impressed
16:21  iaj: it s*** actually 
16:21  iaj: php version is sooo outdated and stuff..
16:21  iaj: well any suggestions?
16:21  danielawaranie: my typoscript above is located at a static file "myTs.txt" and will be included in the typoscript record at the main page of my website, is that a problem?
16:22  pharno: iaj: if you give me 3 weeks, I can host you :)
16:22  pharno: 1und1 I heard is not typo3 compatible
16:25  iaj: pharno: not really no :\\  what's happening in 3 weeks?
16:26  pharno: iaj: well, then I have tested my server^^
16:26  pharno: currently im waiting for dns entry/domain
16:27  pharno: aber du h√§ttest deutschen support, und shell zugriff :)
16:28  pharno: is it possible that the rgaccordion script is broken?
16:28  pharno: it adds to every DOM element style=";height;height;height
16:28  pharno: to EVERY
16:30  pharno: hm
16:30  pharno: maybe I shout write page.includeCSS.file7 and not age.includeCSS.file7 ...
16:39  e_: goddamn, i can't find how to disable the baseurl
16:39  pharno: e_: why should you want that?
16:41  GaiusOctavius: how can I render the menue as image? I already wrote the typoscriot explanation, but still confused :-/
16:41  GaiusOctavius: What is the first assignment? TMENU.text = IMAGE ?
16:43  e_: pharno: reverse proxies?
16:43  e_: pharno: with <base> it's getting increasingly hard to integrate typo3 behind reverse proxies..
16:43  e_: i want to get rid of the <base> tag
16:44  pharno: ah, didnt know
16:50  GaiusOctavius: please, I really try to understand it, but I don't get it. Can anyone help me?
16:51  pharno: no, sry
16:51  danielawaranie: die() in userFunc not called, but why?
16:51  danielawaranie: includeLibs.something=fileadmin/user_getSubdomainBaseUrl.php
16:51  danielawaranie: config.baseURL=USER_INT
16:51  danielawaranie: config.baseURL.userFunc=user_mytestfunction
16:52  danielawaranie: the function "user_mytestfunction()" is not a method of a class it is standalone.
16:52  danielawaranie: why is the die() not stopping the html output?
