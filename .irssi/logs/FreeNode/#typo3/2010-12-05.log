12:22  dec___: how do i allow the <code> tag in the ttnews rte?
12:24  MindSpark: hi, is there any way I can add css to a certain page ?
12:25  MindSpark: as far as I understood, I can somehow do that using tsconfig ?
12:42  Guschtel: dec___: why would you do that?
12:42  dec___: im using a syntax highlight extension
12:42  dec___: it works fine in regular content elements, but doesn't work in ttnews
12:42  dec___: it shows <code></code> in the frontend, through htmlspecialchars
12:42  dec___: so I'm guessing I need to allow the class to ttnews, but I can't find how :(
12:42  Guschtel: set allowTags accordingly
12:42  Guschtel: RTE.default.proc.allowTags
12:43  dec___: yep it's in there
12:43  dec___: hence why it's working for normal content elements
12:43  dec___: but i dunno how to set it for ttnews seperaretly
12:43  Guschtel: for tt_news set plugin.tt_news.general_stdWrap.parseFunc.allowTags
12:44  Guschtel: MindSpark: you could add an extension template to that page
12:44  dec___:  plugin.tt_news.general_stdWrap.parseFunc.allowTags := addToList(code) like this i'm guessing
12:44  Guschtel: plugin.tt_news.general_stdWrap.parseFunc.allowTags = foo,bar,baz
12:45  Olf_: morning
12:45  dec___: doesn't work =/ ive tried that before
12:45  Guschtel: ur doing it wrong ;)
12:46  Olf_: what's up?
12:46  dec___: when i look in the object browser it's fine though
12:46  dec___: Olf: trying to allow the tag <code> in ttnews elements, works fine in regular text elements
12:46  dec___: tried plugin.tt_news.general_stdWrap.parseFunc.allowTags = code  but doesn't work =/
12:47  Guschtel: http://pastebin.com/zi5TAQbb should work
12:47  Guschtel: you have to adjust it for the different displays
12:48  Olf_: mhm looks reasonable Gus
12:48  Guschtel: dec___: look at the *displaySingle* vs. *general_stdWrap*
12:48  Guschtel: Olf_: Gus[tab]
12:48  dec___: ok, cheers
12:51  Bejjan: "and trust me, that coal is filthy!" ;>
12:53  dec___: allowing the tag like that worked, but it doesnt substitute the <code> stuff with the plugin stuf... should i use something like this
12:53  dec___: plugin.tt_news.displaySingle.content_stdWrap.parseFunc < RTE.default.proc
12:59  dec___: plugin.tt_news.displaySingle.content_stdWrap.parseFunc < lib.parseFunc_RTE worked ;) 
13:03  Guschtel: remember, just for single display
13:07  dec___: yep

14:13  Conic: does someone in here have some knowledge about mailformplus?
14:14  Guschtel: just ask
14:14  Conic: i need to add elements to the form by something like FCEs, which are aditable in the Page module
14:15  Guschtel: instead of typoscript you mean?
14:15  Conic: yes
14:15  Conic: the editor needs to add/remove "catalogues", which are a checkbox each
14:15  Guschtel: i have no idea, sorry

14:15  Conic: hm
14:16  Conic: is there any way to handly mailformplus flexible?
14:16  Conic: *handle
14:35  MindSpark: Guschtel, is there any way I can just write the css in the tsconfig ?
14:39  Guschtel: don't know
14:39  Guschtel: what would be the usecase for this?
14:41  Guschtel: hm, you can actually
14:41  Guschtel: page.headerData.5 = TEXT
14:41  Guschtel: page.headerData.5.value (
14:41  Guschtel: <style type="text/css">
14:41  Guschtel: ...
14:41  Guschtel: </style> 
14:41  Guschtel: }
