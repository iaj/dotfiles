08:36  douglasb: where is it supposed to be?
08:37  groendraakie: what is supposed to be weher?
08:37  groendraakie: where...
08:37  groendraakie: the link icon or your template file?
08:37  douglasb: i made a DS called "Ham Cheese"
08:37  douglasb: i don't see it in the folder tree
08:37  douglasb: after i clicked the link icon
08:38  groendraakie: no, you shouldn't
08:38 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 124 seconds
08:38  groendraakie: you should see temp[late.html somewhere
08:38  groendraakie: the DS is not a file
08:38  douglasb: back up one step then
08:39  groendraakie: You don't do anything for BElayout Template File
08:39  douglasb: i'm on the "crete new templavoila template...." form
08:39  groendraakie: ok
08:39  groendraakie: give it a name (same name, with [template] appended)
08:39  douglasb: you said click file reference link icon
08:39  groendraakie: so Ham Cheese [template]
08:39  douglasb: exactly
08:39  douglasb: Ham Cheese [template]
08:39  douglasb: in Title
08:40  groendraakie: then you click file-reference:, the link icon
08:40  douglasb: then i clicked link on far right of file reference
08:40  douglasb: yes
08:40  douglasb: got a pop up
08:40  groendraakie: you get your filelist-folder view
08:40  groendraakie: find yout template.html-file there
08:40  douglasb: yes
08:40  douglasb: OH, the file i was trying to work on??
08:40  groendraakie: (sorry for the typing, it's early here)
08:40  groendraakie: yup, thataone
08:40  douglasb: and it's late here :)
08:41  douglasb: deerrrrr
08:41  douglasb: got it
08:41  douglasb: i'm on east coast USA
08:41  douglasb: 2:45am :)
08:41  groendraakie: select your Data structure in the dropdown
08:41  douglasb: done
08:41  groendraakie: ah ok (that's late...)
08:41  groendraakie: save,close
08:41  groendraakie: Netherlands 8:41
08:42  groendraakie: (not that early,just caffeine-deficiency ;))
08:42  douglasb: you have coffee, you should be all set :)
08:42  douglasb: lol
08:42  groendraakie: ok.
08:42  groendraakie: now go to WEB > Templavoila
08:42  groendraakie: anything in there?
08:42  douglasb: it says "step 4"
08:43  groendraakie: still the wizard I'm afraid...
08:43  douglasb: should the wizard not even be there?
08:43  groendraakie: I never used the wizard..
08:43  groendraakie: ok, back to the list view
08:44  douglasb: i see the TO and DS
08:44  groendraakie: in list or templavoila view?
08:44  douglasb: list
08:44  groendraakie: ok. click the to-icon
08:45  groendraakie: then you shouls see 'templavoila!'
08:45  douglasb: YES
08:45  douglasb: on bottom of list
08:45  groendraakie: click it,
08:45  groendraakie: and click Modify DS/TO
08:45  groendraakie: ignore any warning and click 'save'
08:45  douglasb: i got a warning
08:45  douglasb: k
08:45  groendraakie: :D
08:46  douglasb: i hit save
08:46  groendraakie: now you're on the point where you can begin mapping according to the tutorial
08:46  douglasb: did we just create a blank ds and to?
08:47  groendraakie: yup
08:47  douglasb: this is backwards from the tutorial, right?
08:47  groendraakie: eeehm, yes :)
08:47  groendraakie: actually, it is doing what the file>filelist thingy does by hand
08:48  douglasb: if i go to file view, the template i chose still doesn't have the TV
08:48  douglasb: let me reload backend
08:48  groendraakie: it shouldn't be necessary, but I don't know why it doesn't work in your install so...
08:49  douglasb: yes, reloaded, cleared cache, etc. no TV icon on that file in fileview
08:49  groendraakie: very strange. And in templavoila-view, in the 'template files'-tab, it mentions the file?
08:50  douglasb: if i go to web > tv and click storage folder, i still see step 4:...
08:51  groendraakie: maybe just let the wizard finish, if there's no button that says 'cancel'
08:51  douglasb: i just clicked cancel on the tv wizard
08:51  groendraakie: hmmm
08:51  groendraakie: and?
08:51  douglasb: i see my template in there now :)
08:52  groendraakie: yay :)
08:52  douglasb: on templates tab in tv view of storage folder
08:53  groendraakie: So I hope you can work with it now (start with 'update mapping, change DS/TO and go from there)
08:53  douglasb: wow. thanks so much.
08:53  douglasb: i'm going to save this thread :)
08:55  groendraakie: :D
08:55  douglasb: do you know off hand is there is a better TV-focused tutorial than the outdated one on the main site?
08:56  douglasb: i bought 4 typo3 books from packt, have read all over the place, and am still kind of clueless as where to start digging in, for TV sites, not the markers way
08:56  groendraakie: afaik there isn't. It's still valid, but the images are outdated :)
08:57  douglasb: so how do people learn typo3 primarily? nice people on IRC? :)
08:58  groendraakie: hahaha, I took the way you took: modern and futuristic template building. TV just qorked for me :S
09:01  kamal_bohara: Hello
09:02  douglasb: thanks so much, groendraakie
09:02  kamal_bohara: i have no idea how to add the extension for add/edit/delete data in backend module
09:05  kamal_bohara: could anybody help me regarding this?
09:05  _ramo: hi
09:05  groendraakie: douglasb: your welcome (i've got coffee now, yay)
09:05  douglasb: starbucks french roast here, aftet I get up :) thx again...

09:19  kamal_bohara: anybody have the idea about backend module extesions ?
09:25  aterriblechaos: kamal_bohara: thats done by TCA, you should create a extension with the kickstarter  to get a working skelleton
09:34  Frosty: *Sigh* I'ma prepared to get flamed for this, but a cursory search of Typo3 wiki could help me solve this problem
09:34  Frosty: I am helping a client install a Typo3 site that was already in existence to a new webserver (vitual host)
09:34  Frosty: his pages will now always load Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in /u/a/adam.volcov/affluenture/typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/index_ts.php on line 344
09:36  Frosty: I'm convinced that this is to do with the version incompatibility between our virtualhost and the Typo3, but I can't find a list of supported versions, nor how to upgrade the hosting
09:36  aterriblechaos: Frosty: sounds like you have a old php version (<5.1)
09:37  Frosty: Quite likely. Is there a way I can modify the Typo3 content to allow for an older version of the server?
09:37  aterriblechaos: http://typo3.org/about/system-requirements/ err needs php 5.2
09:37  aterriblechaos: you could use a typo3 <4.2 ... but i would not do that
09:38  aterriblechaos: if you want to use typo3, meet the system requirements, its simple
09:40  Frosty: Yeah, the hosting that this client has picked is running 4.4
09:41  Frosty: it's consequently free - but neverthe less.
09:41  Frosty: Thanks aterriblechaos
09:41  Frosty: Good to know people still help noobs in a pinch :)
09:42 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
09:59  iaj: im curious, i don't have the space to backup the current typo version - which is 4.1.1 on my server - should I just give it a go or stick with the old version?
10:08  Nugae: hi. its possible to use extbase classes in BE extension? can You give some examples, please
10:09  kamal_bohara: aterriblechaos : Thanks so much
10:10  kamal_bohara: but how can we interact with DB tables
10:10  kamal_bohara: i want to create a new extenshion for add/edit/delete category 
10:10  ndee: anyone remembers, howto create a notification in the backend, in a green box?
10:10  marcuslind: A client that used another developer for their site has a problem with maxwidth on their images. Trying to publish an image that's 352px wide in a 370px <div> but it's locked to maximum 300px. I've looked through the template and the constants. Couldnt find anything locked on 300px.
10:10  ndee: I remember that I read a news entry on typo3.org but I can't find it anymore :/
10:10  marcuslind: What could cause this?
10:12  aterriblechaos: ndee: did you check constants? if site is done in templavoila you need to check the ds too
10:12  aterriblechaos: err not ndee... was for marcuslind
10:12  ndee: :D
10:13  aterriblechaos: ndee: http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/core/article/43-treasure-trove-flash-messages/
10:14  ndee: aterriblechaos, exactly, thanks :D
10:14  aterriblechaos: kamal_bohara: you can do that with the kickstarter, just try it out and read some tutorials online ..-
10:14 --- MyGoddessClone is now known as MyGoddess
10:14  ndee: aterriblechaos, do you know if I can use those flash messages in an evaluateFieldValue function?
10:15  aterriblechaos: should work there, but i did never tried that
10:15  marcuslind: aterriblechaos: You I did check both the Template Setup and the Template Constants.
10:15  marcuslind: What did you mean by checking the Datastructure?
10:15  ndee: AWESOME
10:15  ndee: I love it :D
10:15  ndee: it works as expected :)
10:16  aterriblechaos: marcuslind: in templavoila you can set default values for columns, its saved in ds
10:18  marcuslind: aterriblechaos: Im looking through it now. What line should I be looking for?
10:18  marcuslind: Like <maxwidth>300</maxwidth>?
10:18  aterriblechaos: load_register and setting maxwidth, file.maxW or something ..
10:19  aterriblechaos: its in the 10=RECORDS/WHATEVER part
10:19  marcuslind: in the DS XML?
10:20  marcuslind: then no
10:20  marcuslind: there's nothing there.
10:20  marcuslind: weird.
10:31  kamal_bohara: aterriblechaos : ok Thanks a lot
10:35  aterriblechaos: marcuslind: try to change constants (constant editor, styles.content.imgtext.maxW and  styles.content.imgtext.maxWInText). default is 600px, but for text with image its 50% (300px)
10:38  ndee: anyone knows how I can change the encoding of a page from utf8 to something exotic? :D
10:39  ndee: metaCharset to the rescue
10:47  teppi|work: ndee, at first i think you'll have to transform the database contents via iconv to the new charset ..
10:48  ndee: teppi|work, the thing is, an external partner "scans" the webpage and needs that encoding so, it's up to them to do that :D
10:48  ndee: but thanks for the hint!
10:48  teppi|work: lol?
10:49  ndee: teppi|work, it's complicated.
10:49  teppi|work: k
10:52  teppi|work: ndee, if they are trying to do that with typo3 maybe have a look into this class http://www.typo3-unleashed.net/typo3apidocs/typo3api_4.4.2/html/db/db1/classt3lib__cs.html .. worked for me .. 
10:53  bing: Bonjourno!
10:53  ndee: teppi|work, do you know how to iconv the whole output of a page?
10:53  teppi|work: ndee, maybe use wget and iconv in combination?
10:54  ndee: teppi|work, ah ok, no config.convert_output_iconv = utf8_to_iso8859-2? :D
10:55  bing: I hope this is a simple setting:   Does anyone know why my javascript allert box (EREG in mailform) displays my html incorrect for instant a space is %20
10:56  teppi|work: bing, the content seems to be url_encoded
10:57  _ramo: is there an kickstarter extension which works with php 5.3.3 without deprecated errors?
10:57  bing: teppi|work its the default mailform used that option for ages
10:58  bing: teppi|work on an older version of typo3 it seems to work fine. any way i can disable that url_encoded
11:00  teppi|work: bing, sry never heard of this problem .. have you looked for this issue in the bugtracker?
11:01  bing: that the point, dont really know what to look for, how do they call this way of displaying ?
11:01  teppi|work: validation mail form
11:01  teppi|work: ?
11:01  teppi|work: something like this
11:01  teppi|work: _ramo, if the latest release throws these errors .. I don't think so
11:03  bing: teppi|work http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=3527 that does look a little like mine
11:04  teppi|work: http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=9148

11:49  Gianni: yes, moment
11:50  bing: PM me
12:00  Denyerek: Gianni it sounds like you have to set up the site's template.
12:00  Denyerek: As I think the default template will simply say "Hello world"
12:02  randomresult: anyone around? 
12:03  randomresult: im having trouble importing an t3d file... all my contentelements are in "non used elements" now... TV lost all relations... and i dont know why

12:47  sorenmalling: Anyone here with luck using TCEFORM.tt_content.imagecols = 1? So it doesn't have a standard of "2" in the amount of columns?
12:51  aterriblechaos: sorenmalling: isnt it TCAdefaults.tt_content.imagecols = 1 ?
12:52  sorenmalling: Nope, it doesn't work . for some reason it doesn't "overrule" the "default" value in the tca
13:02  aterriblechaos: strange, TCAdefaults.tt_content.imagecols = 5  works for me for text with image but not for images only

13:25  bing: Cant find why ! :

13:25  bing: cracking my head basicly al morning over it
13:28  sorenmalling: bing: do you have a link?
13:30  sorenmalling: bing: What does the content in your database look like for the form? Does it contain the "%20"  asswell
13:33  _ramo: what could be the problem, if i created a extension with the kickstarter, and afterwards want to download that extension from the backend, but nothing happens when i click on the download "button", just a grey area in the backend....
13:37  sorenmalling: _ramo: Any output to your PHP error log?

15:51  snoy_ms: _ramo: it comes from the  tslib_pibase class
15:51  snoy_ms: _ramo: http://doc-typo3.ameos.com/4.1.0/class_8tslib__pibase_8php-source.html
15:53  _ramo: snoy_ms: thank you for the information... are there more classes to use while developing an extension?
15:53  snoy_ms: _ramo: your class inherents from the pibase class. Thats why you can use that
15:54  _ramo: snoy_ms: yes, i understood this.... i guess i'm search for the API of typo3 that i can use while developing my own extensions :)
15:54  _ramo: for example http://api.typo3.org/typo3v4/current/html/annotated.html snoy_ms
15:54  snoy_ms: _ramo: https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/branches/TYPO3_4-4/t3lib/class.t3lib_div.php
15:55  snoy_ms: _ramo: or https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/branches/TYPO3_4-4/t3lib/class.t3lib_db.php
15:55  snoy_ms: _ramo: just examples...
15:55  _ramo: snoy_ms: yeah, thank you... i searched for the API 
15:56  snoy_ms: _ramo: i thought you mean the public functions
15:57  snoy_ms: _ramo: http://typo3.org/documentation/api/

16:22  dec__: does typo3 use imagemagick or gdlib for resizing images using typoscript?
16:26  douglasb: hi: i'm following the futuristic template tutorial and I'm stuck at this step: "For TemplaVoila you should make sure to enable the Page Template Selector in the update screen:"
16:26 --- boonkerz_ is now known as boonkerz
16:26  douglasb: i don't see that on the TV extension page
16:26  Denyerek: that *might* be for old versions of TV
16:27  Denyerek: In fact I am pretty sure it is, but you best check with someone else.
16:28  douglasb: thx denyerek. i'll post to the mail list and see if someone knows. there is no way to tell if that is going to derail my completion of the tutorial!
16:28  douglasb: there are 3 other options on the TV ext page. one sounds similar...
16:31  Denyerek: Some tutorials are dangerously out of date.
16:31  Denyerek: I suspect that might be one of them.
16:32  Denyerek: The thing is, they are very long documents, and re-writing them takes a lot of time.
16:33  douglasb: yes, it sure seems to be the case! the screenshots are def from old versions
16:33 --- pschriner is now known as DerSchreiner
16:33  douglasb: even the HTML examples use tables for layout
16:35  groendraakie: douglasb: it's the second option in Category BASIC
16:35  groendraakie: sorry, no, it isn't
16:36  douglasb: right now, nothing is checked
16:36  groendraakie: just read wrong. 
16:36  douglasb: 3 options
16:36  groendraakie: just leave it that way, it should work according to th etutorial, only with nicer looking screens ;)
16:36  groendraakie: press update. You should do that
16:36  douglasb: :)
16:37  douglasb: hmmm. i hit update. i don't know if I hit a check box by mistake, but this is now checked: "Enable data structure selection [enable.selectDataStructure]"
16:38  douglasb: should that be checked or no?
16:38  groendraakie: not necessarily. Just uncheck it and press update
16:38  douglasb: i'm on a different machine and location from that last time we spoke a few hours ago :)
16:38  groendraakie: :D
16:39  groendraakie: so actually you had a very short night
16:39  douglasb: per usual :)
16:39  douglasb: it's updated, no boxes checked. i'll see if i can keep moving through the tutorial now...
16:40  groendraakie: I surely hope so. It's strange the TV-menu option wasn't there

16:52  Soso: Hi
16:53  Soso: Today I have another question
16:54  Soso: on a multilingual website, how to translate the site title? (website title in template)
16:58  _ramo: if i develop my own extension, and want e.g. connect to the typo3 database can i use methods from typo3 
17:00  aterriblechaos: Soso: leave it empty and translate the prefix in typoscript, http://www.typo3wizard.com/en/snippets/general-config/customize-pagetitle.html
17:03  aterriblechaos: _ramo: yes, there are functions for accessing the database ($GLOBALS["TYPO3_DB"]) .... http://www.freedomson.com/uploads/media/typo3-dev-cheat-sheet.pdf is a good overview
17:04  _ramo: aterriblechaos: thank you
17:15  douglasb: hi  - i'm following along the futuristic template tutorial and am stuck (again). the tutorial says "Just edit the page header of “Root page”:"
17:16  douglasb: yet  on the "extended" tab while in edit mode on the page, i only see "Use Template Design:"
17:17  douglasb: i don't see where to select the DS for the page on this tab, like in the screen shot.
17:20  douglasb: when I go back to Page > Root Page, there are no icons on the "Root Page" bar allowing me to add content.
