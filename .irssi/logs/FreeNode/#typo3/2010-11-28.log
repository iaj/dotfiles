15:44  cwr: quick question i'm importing content into a new typo3 installation from an old one. problem is i have a new structure in fileadmin and all files need to be moved to be moved to a new location.
15:44  cwr: this means all of my links in the pages i imported are dead
15:44 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 136 seconds
15:44  cwr: is there an easy way to handle this?
15:45  cwr: I mean instead of changing each link manually
15:49  cwr: or can I somehow search and replace on all pages for a string like "/downloads/foo/bar/baz" and replace it something else? 
15:49  cwr: oh and of course with wildcards

19:56  swenzel: are some german users here who can help me with login/logout stuff?
19:59  swenzel: well, actually one of my friends needs some help :/
20:01  swenzel: he is not used to irc so i am asking for him... he needs some plugin for users to log out but he can only find a plugin for them to log in
20:06  swenzel: oh come on guys... you cant tell me that you're all idle
20:13  mauimauer: anyone know what could trigger typo3 to translate only the menu but keeping the default lang's content (event if a translated version exists), template setup ts: http://pastebin.com/9Yu8wDw5
20:18  mauimauer: i really can't see why it shows the default content, as typo3 seems to pick up that the desired lang should be en (because the lang menu is correctly updated, as are the real_url's)
22:57  malte``: hey..when i use the gifbuilder to build images with text and own fonts, is usually upload my fonts to my webserver.. but how can i protect them, that nobody can download them (because they didnt have rights to use them)
23:25  SargoDarya: malte`` htaccess?
23:26  malte``: sure, u r right
23:26  Guschtel: malte``: place them outside the document root
23:26  SargoDarya: I'll appreciate a sargodarya++ :>
23:26  Guschtel: SargoDarya: htaccess won't help
23:26  SargoDarya: why?
23:26  Guschtel: could still be served via a script
23:26  SargoDarya: deny from all Oo?
23:27  malte``: outside i a nice idea too
23:27  malte``: *is
23:27  malte``: thanks
23:27  SargoDarya: could still be served by a script
23:27  Guschtel: sure :)
23:27  Guschtel: if server config is broken
23:27  SargoDarya: You can always serve things with scripts. .htaccess is as far as I know the simplest thing
23:28  Guschtel: no, placing outside the docroot is even simpler :)
23:28  SargoDarya: just make a fonts directory in fileadmin and put an .htaccess with deny from all into it
23:28  SargoDarya: bam, you can manage it from the backend and it's not accessable in the frontend
23:28  Guschtel: usually i have a structure like: docroot/ data/ and within data/ you can place whatever you want
23:29  SargoDarya: However, I'm going to bed guys, have fun.
23:29  SargoDarya: Guschtel++
23:29  Guschtel: but thats just convenience
23:29  Guschtel: SargoDarya++
23:29  Guschtel: ;-)
23:29  SargoDarya: Thanks ;)
