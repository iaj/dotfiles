09:27  iaj: lo guys
09:27 --- Channel #typo3 was synced in 3 seconds
09:27  iaj: which browser is best for typo3 development
09:28  maholtz|WORK: @iaj: firefox + firebug extension
09:29  maholtz|WORK: @ndee: do not know
09:30  ndee: the problem is, the declaration is somehow on the 2nd line but it's only allowed on the first line :/
09:31  maholtz|WORK: so, you have an newline before?
09:31  ndee: yes, but I don't know from where it's coming
09:31  maholtz|WORK: so fix that, instead removing xml prologue :)
09:31  ndee: I have config.disableAllHeaderCode = 1
09:31  iaj: maholtz|WORK: which firefox?? :)
09:31  maholtz|WORK: usually there is a php-file which starts with an newline, instead an <?php
09:32  maholtz|WORK: @iaj: the red one? SCNR are there more than one firefox?
09:32  ndee: maholtz|WORK, so I have to edit tt_news core you think? :D
09:32  maholtz|WORK: check that files, but i guess there is an different extension which hooks into the rendering which has an newline at the start or the end
09:33  maholtz|WORK: hm.. its difficult to debug
09:33  ndee: it's a real real pita
09:33  maholtz|WORK: and your website does not have it?
09:34  ndee: maholtz|WORK, it does too
09:34  maholtz|WORK: ok, so dont blame tt_news
09:34  maholtz|WORK: check the dynamic tempfiles in typo3conf/ perhaps you have there an unneded newline too.. (just guessing)
09:35  maholtz|WORK: or deactivate each not standard extension...
09:35  maholtz|WORK: (well, tt_news 3.0.1 or above, not 3.0.0 right?)
09:35  ndee: tt_news 3.0.1
09:36  ndee: nah, I didn't want to blame tt_news :) I gonna fiddle around some more
09:37  iaj: maholtz|WORK: i ment ff 3.6 or ff4.0 nightly :)
09:38  ndee: maholtz|WORK, http://www.pastie.org/1292095 <-- that's my Setup for that page, I clear all constants & setup, and I include the tt_news settings & tt_news xml settings.
09:38  Denyerek: GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MOOOOOOORNING TYPONAAAAAAAAAM
09:38  ndee: :D
09:39 * Denyerek listens to the sound of distant webservers exploding
09:40  deiga: Hey, does anyone know, how typo links templates to pages?
09:40  deiga: I've been scouring the database, but can't find any obvious link, which would reference the existing tempaltes
09:40  deiga: *templates
09:41  Denyerek: I think it's inferred from the heirarchy ?
09:42  Denyerek: EG if you give the top page a template record, all the child pages accept it too
09:42  Denyerek: unless you introduce an extension template at a lower level to override it
09:42  deiga: honestly, that woul suck monkey balls
09:43  deiga: *would
09:43  Denyerek: It's never caused me an issue
09:43  Denyerek: but then I build with TemplateVoila
09:43  deiga: I'm trying to make a system that would export a single page, with all templates which are currently installed
09:44  Denyerek: so I can set the page structure on a per-page basis if I choose
09:44  Denyerek: Just right click and hit "Export"
09:44  Denyerek: it'll find all the related records
09:44  deiga: yeah I have templavoila too
09:44  maholtz|WORK: @iaj: if you think you can sepearate between ff4.0 and TYPO3 Bugs, chose ff4.0 otherwise i would prefer stable
09:44  Denyerek: you're aware of the T3X export functiojn ?
09:44  maholtz|WORK: Godmorning Sir @Denyerek, Sir!
09:45 * Denyerek waves
09:45  deiga: Denyerek: aware, yes. Haven't studied it though
09:45  maholtz|WORK: @ndee: well, it is not an typoscript issue, but an php-file issue
09:45  Denyerek: deiga: is the export function not what you want, then? 
09:45  ndee: maholtz|WORK, ok, and that could be anywhere. I gonna try it without the xml prologue then :/
09:46  deiga: not sure you understood me. Let's say my system has 10 templates. I create a page, which I need to assign to one of the templates. Then I'd like to export the page, so that it exports it 10 times, once for and with each template
09:47  maholtz|WORK: @ndee: just disable one extension after another and check if it helps (well, or just copy the list of extensions, i can guess which you should try;)
09:48  ndee: maholtz|WORK, the problem is, we're using tons of extensions. But if I clear all the setup and constants and include no template, shouldn't that give me a totally clean page?
09:50  maholtz|WORK: yep, but it will not be, if an extension is not written properly
09:50  maholtz|WORK: because the extensions are include
09:50  maholtz|WORK: so did you try to have a look at the cached files? did that give you a hint?
09:56  Denyerek: AHHHH deiga
09:57  Denyerek: Ok yes you are correct, I did not understand you.
09:57  Denyerek: Do you mean TV DS/TO templates or do you mean Typoscript templates?
09:57  Denyerek: I can imagine it being possible with the TV style
09:57  Denyerek: not sure about TS though
10:04  deiga: umm, I think I mean TV styles. Not sure what all those are :P
10:04  Denyerek: OK so when you create a TV template and map things a certain way
10:05  Denyerek: You want to make 10 different "styles"
10:05  Denyerek: I still don't know how you'd do it, but I thought i'd try and at least figure out what you wanted to do
10:05  Denyerek: :)
10:07  deiga: I don't think that just 10 different styles covers it. Styles don't add content (or shouldn't). What I basically need is 10 different templates
10:28  tt_productsuser: hallo
10:31  tt_productsuser: hello, does some of you know something about tt_products?
10:31  maholtz|WORK: just try to use an different extension
10:32  tt_productsuser: wich one
10:32  maholtz|WORK: if you need really an shop, try commerce
10:33  tt_productsuser: that shold be better?
10:33  tt_productsuser: no shop  extension there to integrate in typo3
10:34  tt_productsuser: thanks for that - i will try it
10:38  maholtz|WORK: well, depends on what you need
10:38  aterriblechaos: :( TYPO3 4.5: ... the backend is faster than before, but because of the new loading indicator it feels much slower than old versions because you cant start working before everything is load .....
10:38  maholtz|WORK: imho you can integrate magento & co, but i have no experience with that. we usually are using only shops as product listing or add ons, not really for shops
10:39  maholtz|WORK: imho commerce is a good shop solution
10:39  tt_productsuser: just 20 ok
10:39  tt_productsuser: ok
10:42  tt_productsuser: nice day - thanks
10:46  Conic: g'mornin...
10:47  Conic: i want to set ts constants in a usergroup, is that possible?
10:48  aterriblechaos: Conic: i dont think so ... but you can use typoscript conditions to set them depending on the usergroup
10:49  Conic: yep
10:50  Conic: but that makes the code very complex to understand
10:50  Conic: aktually i do it this way now
10:50  Conic: but i would be happy if i could overwrite these constants in the usergroup
10:52  aterriblechaos: Conic: you could use external includes to clean it up .. http://pastebin.com/PZ4v9mga
10:56  Denyerek: maholtz, you'd rate Commerce above tt_products?
11:00  maholtz|WORK: i would rate doing it by hand above tt_products
11:00  teppi|work: lol
11:00  maholtz|WORK: i just used it for two pretty simple task for internal shops, but the design didnt expect to look like tt_products want to. ohne of the shops only needed to send a mail - i did it with typoscript and powermail. it is much more flexible.
11:02  maholtz|WORK: but i am biased - i do not know if the author changes his behaivor, but in past he changed code without changing version number of tt_products
11:02  maholtz|WORK: so 2.4.2 behaves different - depending on when you had installed it
11:03  Conic: aterriblechaos: yes, that would be an idea
11:03  aterriblechaos: i did a shop in commerce, never again ...
11:06  maholtz|WORK: @aterriblechaos: well, i did not say, that commerce is perfect, but in comparison with tt_products i recommand commerce
11:07  maholtz|WORK: i do not know, if there is a nice shop extension between commerce and tt_products
11:14 --- Conic is now known as Conic-afk
11:16  Denyerek: The question is, then, how come no-one has made a decent typo shop!
11:16  Denyerek: the most common request I get from clients is to be able to sell things through their site.
11:16  Denyerek: and the lack of a sane shop module is really painful.
11:17  Denyerek: perhaps the latest version of tt_products isn't so bad... The manual seemed to be OK, but then that's only a tiny part of the story.
11:17  maholtz|WORK: ever tried gsa_shop?
11:17  maholtz|WORK: there are some typo3 shop systems
11:17  maholtz|WORK: i did kirschenshop.de with commerce and it just works, so
11:18  maholtz|WORK: imho commerce is ok for that (well, you need to use that backend modul)
11:19  maholtz|WORK: well, and that was three years ago
11:22  Denyerek: it might well have improved significantly.
11:22  Denyerek: (Or stayed the same)
11:22  Denyerek: (Or bloated itself to death)
11:22  maholtz|WORK: lol, yep that could be
11:23  Denyerek: Hmm
11:23  Denyerek: last update 2009
11:23  Denyerek: manual says "Still in beta"
11:23  Denyerek: doesn't fill me with much confidence
11:25 --- Conic-afk is now known as Conic
11:30  lindbergh: hello list
11:31  lindbergh: I have short question
11:31  lindbergh: if I have two sites
11:32  lindbergh: site A and site B
11:32  lindbergh: if I want to use page templates form site B in site A and vice versa...do I need to make any configurations or it is simple copy paste.
11:33  lindbergh: automake template approach
11:37  Denyerek: I guess that depends on the complexity of the templates.
11:37  Denyerek: EG if one hook into HTML that doesn't exist on the other.

15:30  s-andersen: I just moved a TYPO3 installation from one server to another. However, the new server has PHP 5.3, and TYPO3 throws a lot of deprecation errors. Is there any way I can configure TYPO3 to stop doing that?
15:31  dec__: my typo3 installation automatically adds loads of javascript and css (inline)
15:31  dec__: how can i remove this?
15:32  dec__: it looks like this 
15:32  dec__: http://pastebin.com/ygwyJtiA
15:32  dec__: it's messing up my source code
15:32  CaptainChaos: hi. i have an admin user but cant edit usergroups anymore, since i cleared the user settings table via install tool, since there was a new tsconfig for a usergroup i am not even in... its typo3 4.3.3. any help?
15:35  CaptainChaos: the icons next to the groups are gone, and nothing happens when choosing "edit" in the right-click-menu
15:40  CaptainChaos: got it. dumb thing, extended view wasnt set. sorry :D
15:41  maholtz|WORK: @dec__: thats css_styled_content default style, you can disable it in typoscript, but you need to define that on your own then
15:42  maholtz|WORK: plugin.tx_cssstyledcontent._CSS_DEFAULT_STYLE >
15:42  maholtz|WORK: remove that style if you really need too
15:47  ThomasW: Hi guys
15:47  ThomasW: I need some help with WT_GALLERY 3.0
15:47  ThomasW: anyone care to help me?
15:48  ThomasW: hello?
15:50  ThomasW: hello?
15:53  maholtz|WORK: @ThomasW: hi
15:53  maholtz|WORK: it needs sometimes some more time
15:53  maholtz|WORK: crap
15:53  ries: maholtz|WORK: inpatient people...
15:53  maholtz|WORK: ok, 6 minutes for such an simple question is to much
15:53  maholtz|WORK: yep
15:56  ThomasW: hi all
15:56  ThomasW: I need some help with wt_gallery 3.0
15:56  ThomasW: anyone care to help?
15:56  maholtz|WORK: @ThomasW: we read that
15:57  maholtz|WORK: keep in mind, the most are at work
15:57  ThomasW: ah ok
15:57  maholtz|WORK: so it takes time to answer
15:57  ThomasW: thanks
15:57  maholtz|WORK: and you did not yet explained what the problem is
15:57  maholtz|WORK: i never used wt_gallery, but perhaps i can help you anyway
15:57  maholtz|WORK: and i will - if i have time :)
15:57  maholtz|WORK: btw: welcome:)
15:58  maholtz|WORK: sometimes its worth to ask the question again after a few hours
16:01  ThomasW: ah okay
16:01  ThomasW: I will to that :)
16:02  ThomasW: the problem with wt_gallery is: I have no idea how it works
16:02  ThomasW: so I need some who works or has worked with wt_gallery
16:02  maholtz|WORK: the manual does not help?
16:02  ThomasW: No it only explains what you can do with it
16:02  ThomasW: but actually setting up a image gallery is not explained
16:02  ThomasW: funny eenough
16:03  maholtz|WORK: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/wt_gallery/3.1.7/view/1/3/ and http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/wt_gallery/3.1.7/view/1/4/ does not help?
16:06  ThomasW: let's see
16:06  ThomasW: no it only explains the configuration
16:07  ThomasW: but not how to create the folders etc
16:26  maholtz|WORK: @ThomasW: "Pic Folder: Please select the path to the picture folder like fileadmin/path/."
16:31  ThomasW: Yes that I understood
16:31  ThomasW: but you also have to create folders in the page tree or something
16:31  ThomasW: otherwise you get errors on the page that you havent selected a valid directory
16:49  CaptainChaos: is there a possibility to replace the rte-link-icon by an ascii-code?
