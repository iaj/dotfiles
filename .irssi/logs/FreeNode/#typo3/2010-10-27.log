13:40  unmatrix: is there an equivalent for "foo .= bar" in typoscript?
13:43  unmatrix: nevermind
13:50  Chiz: ok
13:50  Chiz: guys
13:50  Chiz: I'll ask in other way
13:50  Chiz: I have my menu as DIVs
13:51  Chiz: How can I change text in each menu item?
13:51  Chiz: I'm not using <ul></ul> or <ol></ol>
13:52  Chiz: First level, second, third, all made by <DIV></DIV>
13:52  Chiz: I want insert numbering in front of every menu item
13:52  Chiz: Can I do this by some extension?
14:16  maholtz|WORK: @unmatrix: sill there? try :=appendString()
14:16  maholtz|WORK: or := prependString(string)
14:21  unmatrix: thx
14:22  unmatrix: i have a bigger problem now - how to get the right subtitle of a page if L != 0 -> DB:pages:... didn't work an RECORDS didn't work, too
14:28  Bejjan: could someone do a whois on bejjan.net and tell me what nameservers are listed ?
14:32  unmatrix: ns[1-4].loopia.se
14:32  Bejjan: thanks
14:32  Bejjan: things are like they should
14:32  Bejjan: old dns provider failed to update their dns server so i just redelegated it to another dns provide

14:54  GroenDraakie: does anyone use jvb_gallerific?
15:06  marcuslind: I'm using cURL in a typo3 extension that I've developed. It works fine on two servers but on one of our client server it just result in a blank, white page without PHP errors. Could it have something to do with the server-settings?
15:06  HendrixSthlm: Does anyone here have any experience with indexed search for a large number of pages? (~10 000)
15:07  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind > I had a similar problem recently which was related to the use of SSL. Are you using SSL?
15:07  marcuslind: HendrixSthlm:  nope
15:08  marcuslind: It's just a normal cURL where I send a variable
15:08  marcuslind: to a IP
15:08  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind: Are you sure that curl is present on the third server? Have you checked using phpinfo or similar?
15:10  marcuslind: HendrixSthlm: How dO I check that in the phpinfo?
15:10  marcuslind: I'm looking at the phpinfo now
15:10  marcuslind: what should I be looking for
15:11  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind: Just do a simple search in the page for curl
15:11  marcuslind: ye that doesnt exist 
15:11  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind: Well that's your problem then.
15:11  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind: Your client needs to install curl on their server.
15:12  marcuslind: OK i thought cURL was standard on PHP
15:13  HendrixSthlm: marcuslind: I'm not sure whether it's standard or not, but it is not uncommon to encounter server without it.

15:47  maholtz|WORK: @HendrixSthlm: use stopwords with indexed_search
15:47  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK: stopwords?
15:47  maholtz|WORK: you can decrease table sizes
15:48  maholtz|WORK: sorry, in german: http://blog.martinholtz.de/blog-post/2009/10/03/indexed-search-performance-probleme/
15:48  HendrixSthlm: I think I can work it out.
15:49  maholtz|WORK: in info modul you get an overview about the indexed pages
15:49  maholtz|WORK: if you click on the title, you will get more informations
15:50  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK:Okey. Thanks a lot for the pointers!
15:50  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK: I was thinking of moving the index_rel and index_word tables to a MEMORY table in MySQL.
15:51  maholtz|WORK: well, i think the stopword thing can only help a bit
15:51  maholtz|WORK: and indexed_search will not find any word you defined as stopword
15:51  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK: I'll read your blogpost and give it a think
15:52  maholtz|WORK: which could become difficult in a multilanguage environment
15:52  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK: We only use English and Swedish so we should be fine.
15:53  maholtz|WORK: one important pointer: you can only see the stopwords, which are on the page you are looking at - so imho you can only see all stopwords if you use phpmyadmin
15:54  ries: HendrixSthlm: if you have that much pages, I would highly suggest to look at the solr extension
16:04  HendrixSthlm: maholtz|WORK: I have now gotten ridden of a lot of stopwords. Gonna take 7,8,9,0 via myadmin
16:05  HendrixSthlm: ries: Yeah, maybe we will look at it. But it would be nice to get indexed search to run decently meanwhile.
16:06  ries: HendrixSthlm: if you want you can run a test with Solr and use my Solr Server, so you can see what it is and how it works

16:48 --- boonkerz_ is now known as boonkerz
16:56  tuxx__: hey guys?
16:57  GroenDraakie: wazzup?
17:05  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: hey man.. im having trouble with typo3
17:05  tuxx__: im completely new to it.. and just installed it a few hours ago
17:05  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: the installation was a bitch .. but it seems to be configured now :)
17:06  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i imported a .t3d template.. and it shows nicely in typo3 and is editable
17:06  HendrixSthlm: tuxx___: Tough situation Typo3 can be quite unpleasant before you get to know it.
17:06  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: however... i cant seem to publish the site
17:06  GroenDraakie: publish the site?
17:06  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: well i mean.. make it visible
17:06  GroenDraakie: you dont see anything in th efront-end?
17:06  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: dont i have to publish it somehow?
17:06  GroenDraakie: nope. 
17:07  GroenDraakie: you can look at the back-end. That's mostly www.website.some/typo3
17:07  GroenDraakie: and the fromt-end is www.website.some
17:07  GroenDraakie: front, not fromt
17:07  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: http://sd05.seedplace.eu/cms/typo3/index.php
17:07  tuxx__: user: admin
17:07  tuxx__: passwd: guest
17:07  tuxx__: mind taking a quick look?
17:07  GroenDraakie: ah, empty :)
17:07  tuxx__: im completely at a loss here
17:08  tuxx__: i actually dont even know how to reach the "frontend"
17:08  tuxx__: is it just exported to /var/www ?
17:08  GroenDraakie: It expects the templavoila-extension
17:08  ries: tuxx__: typo3 doesn't export, everything runs from teh CMS
17:09  tuxx__: ries: are the files generated upon request?
17:09  GroenDraakie: tuxx__ yes
17:09  tuxx__: ries: or does typo3 dump the .htmls somewhere?
17:09  ries: tuxx__: not by default...
17:09  ries: tuxx__: Nope, it runs from teh CMS... PHP outputs the generated content
17:09  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: ries is right
17:10  GroenDraakie: tuxx: the site doesn't show anything because templavoila is missing, and the templavoila-template
17:10  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: wtf is that :)
17:10  tuxx__: must i kill myself now?
17:10  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: go to extension manager
17:10  tuxx__: yea i tried adding it earlier
17:10  tuxx__: cuz i read somehting but it asked me to update or osmething
17:10  GroenDraakie: ah, what went wrong
17:10  tuxx__: i dont know really
17:11  GroenDraakie: ok: go to ext-manager and in the top of the page, choose "import extensions"
17:11  GroenDraakie: type templavoila in the input field an press look-up
17:11  ries: tuxx__: GroenDraakie is right, TV is missing
17:12  tuxx__: yes i did that
17:12  tuxx__: then misc -> and the arrow on the first one
17:12  tuxx__: then it asked me to update or something
17:12  GroenDraakie: yes, you should do that
17:12  tuxx__: and after that the arrow disappeared
17:12  GroenDraakie: mom. I'll do it
17:13  GroenDraakie: It asks for the static_info_tables extension. It needs that. I'm importing it now
17:13  tuxx__: thanks mate :)
17:14  GroenDraakie: no prob
17:14  GroenDraakie: the extension is in now. All you need now is to configure templavoils...
17:15  tuxx__: thats "all" aye?
17:15  tuxx__: piece of cake :)
17:15  GroenDraakie: Upload a html page somewhere in the fileadmin (templates-directory is standard I believe
17:15  tuxx__: im going to google on what the hell templavoila is :)
17:15  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i downloaded some free template
17:15  GroenDraakie: wait a minute... search for futuristic template building in the typo3.org documentation section
17:15  GroenDraakie: tuxx: where did you find it?
17:16  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: some dubious website on google
17:16  tuxx__: there was a free and a commercial version of it
17:16  tuxx__: i took the free
17:16  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/tt_news/3.0.1/view/1/4/#id2506939
17:16  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: do you still have the link?
17:16  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: sry man.. can you slow down a bit :)
17:16  tuxx__: im getting too much info :)
17:16  tuxx__: let me check for the link
17:17  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_ftb1/current/
17:17  GroenDraakie: the last link is the right one...
17:17  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: http://www.typo3coder.com/free-typo3-templates/page/1/
17:17  tuxx__: i took one of those :)
17:18  tuxx__: i dont know which anymore :)
17:18  tuxx__: download link was: http://www.typo3coder.com/free-typo3-templates/action/download/template/hanging/free/1/
17:19  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: nice link.. thanks!
17:19  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: TemplaVoila ERROR:
17:19  tuxx__: Couldn't find a Data Structure set for table/row "pages:6".
17:19  tuxx__: Please select a Data Structure and Template Object first.
17:19  GroenDraakie: tuxx__:Ah, I see. There's a fileadmin/template folder. That folder should be uploaded to your web-server
17:20  GroenDraakie: and there's a readme.txt that gives you the exact order of actions to perform...
17:21  GroenDraakie: first install Templavoila, then import the t3d :) (but installing templavoila is not trivial)
17:21  tuxx__: lol
17:22  tuxx__: isnt cms supposed to make life easier rather than harder? :)
17:22  GroenDraakie: yes it should be, and when you know typo3 it is. It has a bit of a learning curve
17:23  tuxx__: suicide is always optional
17:24  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: is templavoila installed now?
17:24  GroenDraakie: tuxx__ yup
17:26  tuxx__: ok thanks
17:27  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i imported the content of the fileadmin/ dir to the fileadmin dir on the server
17:27  tuxx__: must i reimport the t3d?
17:29  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: im still getting templavoila errors :(
17:29  tuxx__: "Couldn't find a Data Structure set for table/row "pages:6".
17:29  GroenDraakie: yes, I expect that
17:29  GroenDraakie: eehm...
17:30  GroenDraakie: hmmm...
17:30  tuxx__: and i cant start the templavoila wizard
17:30  tuxx__: The template directory is empty or could not be found. Please, create it before starting this wizard.
17:31  GroenDraakie: moment... I think it should be possible to import everything again. I'll try
17:36  tuxx__: what the hell why isnt templavoila pre-installed if its so essential?
17:36  GroenDraakie: something is happening now
17:36  tuxx__: ah yes
17:36  tuxx__: i see something too
17:36  tuxx__: sort of...
17:36  GroenDraakie: :) Missing images and stuff
17:36  tuxx__: hah
17:36  tuxx__: whats the difference between
17:36  tuxx__: draft and live workspace?
17:37  GroenDraakie: draft is what you can view. Live what the rest of the world sees
17:37  tuxx__: oh
17:37  tuxx__: the rest of the world
17:37  tuxx__: seems to see templavoila errors
17:37  tuxx__: :)
17:39  GroenDraakie: not anymore. I'm now working in live mode
17:40  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: true
17:40  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: problem is.. i have no idea what you did and will never be able to reproduce it :)
17:41  GroenDraakie: true :)
17:41  GroenDraakie: I'll have to say: i'm patching in an ugly way.
17:41  GroenDraakie: The best thing to do IMO is:
17:41  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: make your own template?
17:41  GroenDraakie: 1 clear the database
17:42  GroenDraakie: 2 create a clean install of typo3
17:42  tuxx__: omg...!
17:42  GroenDraakie: 3 install the static_info_tables extension
17:42  GroenDraakie: 4 install the templavoila extension (and press update at each extension)
17:42  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i found 0 decent guides to installing typo3 actually
17:43  GroenDraakie: 5 upload the template files
17:43  GroenDraakie: and finally: import the t3d
17:43  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i'm going to cry :(
17:43  GroenDraakie: tuxx__ actually it can be quite simple
17:43  tuxx__: basically ur telling me to restart :D
17:43  tuxx__: GroenDraakie: i blieve it will not be so hard the second time around
17:43  tuxx__: i had some stupid "localconf.php is not found!" error
17:44  tuxx__: then i had to comment the die() in the install.php then i had to relink some .js scripts
17:44  tuxx__: and the wierd dummy dir
17:44  tuxx__: was the most confusing
17:44  GroenDraakie: where are you running it? your own server or some hosted platform?
17:44  tuxx__: ubuntu
17:44  GroenDraakie: Ah ok. You have root-privileges?
17:44  tuxx__: yes ofcourse
17:44  GroenDraakie: ok :)
17:44  tuxx__: it was storing the info in /var/lib/typo3-dummy/typo3conf/
17:45  tuxx__: why the hell=
17:45  tuxx__: ?
17:45  tuxx__: geez
17:45  tuxx__: ok i'm going to remove it 
17:45  GroenDraakie: so: extract the dummy dir somewhere, and the typo3-src somewhere near it
17:45  tuxx__: and restart
17:45  tuxx__: well i installed via apt-get
17:45  tuxx__: it installed to standard paths
17:45  GroenDraakie: Ah ok. I don't do that (on ubuntu and debian)
17:45  tuxx__: ok get it from svn?
17:45  GroenDraakie: nope

17:47  GroenDraakie: yup, that's the stable
17:47  tuxx__: downloading
17:47  GroenDraakie: tuxx__: I'm sorry, I have to go. Follow the instructions from the download site. That should work.

18:19  ries: then they will link 'automaticly'

18:46  tuxx__: i think it was an old version
18:46  tuxx__: now i am using the tar ball
18:47  tuxx__: this doenst make sense ::/
18:48  ries: tuxx__: I usually download the tarbal, both the source and the dummy 
18:48  ries: so, tehy are symlinked now?
18:48  tuxx__: well yes
18:48  tuxx__: i have them both in /var/www

18:58  tuxx__: :)
18:58  tuxx__: because from the previous login
