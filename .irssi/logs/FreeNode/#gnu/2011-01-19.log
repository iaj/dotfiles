11:01  iaj: how could I kill all proccesses that do something like /bin/bash (foo1|foo2|foo3)
11:02  AimHere: kill `pgrep <regex>`
11:02  Pegasus-Rider: If you don't use BASH as your shell, just pkill bash :-)
11:02  AimHere: But be careful with the regex
11:02  AimHere: Especially if you DO use bash as your shell ;)
11:03  AimHere: man pgrep
11:04  iaj: heh.. thanks guys!
11:04  iaj: Nah im using zsh... so pkill bash will do the job for now:D
11:38  iaj: Hmmm another thing, can I somehow launch ssh without accessing the .zshrc ?
11:38  iaj: eg use a different shell?
12:34  iaj: AimHere: I don't have grep :(
12:35  iaj: pgrep*
12:35  iaj: How could I kill all processes that have a fnotify in them?
12:35  AimHere: pkill will do if you have that instead
12:36  iaj: AimHere: don't have as well - this is MAC OSX :D
12:36  Pegasus-Rider: killall?
12:36  AimHere: Well this is #gnu, what on earth did you expect?
12:37  Pegasus-Rider: Try killall anyway, it might help
12:37  AimHere: You could try some monstrosity in bash using for and ps and cut and grep
