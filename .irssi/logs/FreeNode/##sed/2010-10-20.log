16:54  evelyette: hi, I have this example: echo "<pre> testing the test|   </pre>|" | sed -e 's/<\/pre>//g'
16:54  evelyette: but I want to delete all the empty characters before the </pre> too .. how can I do that ?
16:55  gnubien: evelyette: delete all lines that begin with "<pre> "
16:55  gnubien: ?
16:55  evelyette: no
16:56  evelyette: delete all the empty spaced before </pre>
16:56  cthuluh: 's,[ TAB]*</pre>,,g'
16:56  evelyette: input is: "<pre> testing the test|   </pre>|"
16:56  evelyette: output should be: "<pre> testing the test||"
16:56  evelyette: cthuluh, it works, thansk :)
16:56  evelyette: what does the TAB stand for ?
16:58  cthuluh: hehe. an actual TAB character. you can type it with C-v TAB, at your bash prompt
16:58  cthuluh: it does _not_ mean "a space, an A, a B or a C". if you actually typed that, it worked by chance
16:58  evelyette: aha
16:59  evelyette: what if I want a SPACE, TAB and NEWLINE
16:59  evelyette: [ TAB\n] ?
16:59  cthuluh: sed works line-wise, it means you can't match a newline easily
16:59  evelyette: aha ok
17:00  evelyette: ah I just run the script and everything works :)
17:00  evelyette: thank you
17:00  cthuluh: yw
17:03  cthuluh: evelyette: if by chance you want to know how you could match a newline, this is an example: sed ': label; $!{ N; b label; }; s/\n/moo/g' file
17:04  evelyette: cthuluh, I think it's too complicated for now ... but if I'll every really need it, I'll ask you
17:04  evelyette: thanks
