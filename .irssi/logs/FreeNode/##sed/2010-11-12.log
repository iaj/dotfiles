01:14  ilab: what is the length of lines that sed begins to have trouble with?  I'm working with files that have up to 16K of data per line
01:24  cthuluh: from the posix specs: "Some of the commands use a hold space to save all or part of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. The pattern and hold spaces will each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes. "
01:27  MTecknology: sed -i 's/,\n/, /g' *  <-- am I doing something wrong there?
01:27  MTecknology: I want to convert all ,<newline> to ,<space>
01:30  MTecknology: If I open the file in vim and do :%s/,\n/, /g it works fine...
01:43 --- ghoti_ is now known as ghoti
02:07  cthuluh: MTecknology: sed will never match a newline, since it doesn't (by default) store newlines
02:08  cthuluh: one way to do it would be: sed ': loop; $!{ N; b loop; }; s/,\n/, /g;'
02:09  MTecknology: oh!
02:10  MTecknology: that makes a crap ton of sense
02:10  MTecknology: thanks :)
02:11  geirha: sed '/,$/{N;s/\
02:11  geirha: /}'
02:11  geirha: err, irc ate a /
02:11  geirha: sed '/,$/{N;s/\
02:11  geirha: / /}'
02:12  geirha: nvm. That won't handle consequtive lines anyway.
02:15  cthuluh: sed ': loop; /,$/ { N; s/,\n/, /; b loop; }' <- should
02:15  MTecknology: wow
02:16  MTecknology: spiffy stuff :)
02:18  cthuluh: though it could be a problem if the last line ends with a ',', and you want to replace it
