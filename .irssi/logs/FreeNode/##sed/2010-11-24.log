00:58  jophish: Hi all!
00:59  jophish: I'm trying to extract text from some files between two tags
00:59  jophish: the opening tag is <td><pre class="lyrics-table">
00:59  jophish: and the closing tag is </pre>
00:59  jophish: at the moment I have this:  sed -i -e '1,/^<td><pre class="lyrics-table">/!{ /^</pre>/,/^<td><pre class="lyrics-table">/!d; }'
01:03  jophish: This seems to be doing the opposite of what I wanted
01:17  jophish: All done

11:03  arctanx: I fear I'm missing something simple but I cannot find it, search through examples though I do... given multi-line input on stdin, can I get sed to return every match of a particular regex, rather than the whole pattern space?
11:04  arctanx: at the moment I'm using perl -e with a while(<>) to go through each line, find matches and then print out the results. but that's not very shell-like
11:05  arctanx: I think sed's my best bet but I can't figure out how to directly print out only a regexp match, or alternatively how to substitute the entire line with a backreference to some part in the middle
11:06  arctanx: I've also read the (sparse) man page and likely looking pages in the info manual and nothing's jumping out at me
11:19  supe: hi
11:19  supe: I'm looking for a tool to search multiple ppt presentations for a certain phrase. Will sed suffice?
11:25  arctanx: supe: assuming that text is stored as plain text in ppt (it may or may not, I don't know), grep 'phrase' *.ppt may be more appropriate for you
