17:21  evelyette: hi
17:21  evelyette: I need some help
17:21  evelyette: I'm reading through the sed tutorial
17:22  evelyette: and I don't understand the patters ...
17:22  evelyette: why use this: <example.txt sed '/^a/ s/[a-z]*//'
17:22  evelyette: if I can use this: <example.txt sed 's/^a[a-z]*//'
17:22  evelyette: which does the same ?
17:24  jwillia3: they don't do the same thing
17:25  jwillia3: the first finds a line that begins with a and does s/[a-z]*//
17:26  evelyette: hm, so the patters are actually like grep ... they first get the lines that match the pattern and then do a substitution ?
17:26  jwillia3: oh, sorry, you're right, didn't read
17:27  jwillia3: evelyette, there is a difference, though, ^a does not subsitute the first 'a'.
17:27  jwillia3: crap, it does. don't mind me, i should just go back to bed.
17:27  evelyette: :)
17:35  waldner: if "a" is a multiple character string, or if using [b-z], then the two are quite different
18:33  evelyette: hi
18:33  evelyette: is it possible to put commands in curly braces in a single line ?
18:33  evelyette: something like: <example.txt sed '/Start/,/End/ {s/Start// s/End//}'
18:38  evelyette: yup, it can be done, by puttin ; in the middle ...
18:38  evelyette: :)
19:05  evelyette: hi
19:05  evelyette: I'm trying to figure out what <exe.txt sed '{N;p}' does
19:05  evelyette: in exe.txt I have 5 lines like this: [1,2,3,4,5]
19:06  evelyette: the p tells me: 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 5
19:06  evelyette: but P: 1 1 2 3 3 4 5
19:06  evelyette: ok, first 1 is read, and then 2 after that
19:06  evelyette: the we print it ... I get that
19:07  evelyette: but what about them ... isn't 1 discarded, 2 is kept and 3 read in ?
19:32  waldner: read what N does
19:34  evelyette: it does this:
19:34  evelyette: read in the next line, but append line character along with the input line itself to the pattern space (don't print or empty the pattern space) - [add the next line to the work buffer]
19:36  evelyette: waldner, ?
19:41  evelyette: ah I get it
