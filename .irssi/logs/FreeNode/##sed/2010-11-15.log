00:21  StFS: Hi. I don't get this... I'm trying to compress whitespaces in a file with 's/[ \t]+/ /g' but it isn't working!? Is this some newbie pitfall that I'm unaware of?
00:32  geirha: That's a extended regular expression. sed uses basic regular expressions
00:33  Riviera: StFS: maybe 's/[[:blank:]]\{2,\}/ /g'
00:34  StFS: Riviera: that works... thanks!
00:35  StFS: Riviera: but what is the deal with the other thing... I just tried 's/[[:space:]]+/ /g' and that doesn't work either... however, 's/[[:space:]]*/ /g' puts a single space in between each character _and_ compresses multiple whitespaces to one
00:36  Riviera: StFS: as geirha said: + is a feature that sed does not support.
00:36  StFS: ahh... didn't notice his reply
00:36  Riviera: :)
00:36  jwillia3: StFS, * matches ANY number of spaces, including zero.
00:36  geirha: StFS: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html#tag_09_03
00:37  StFS: jwillia3: yeah... I knew that so I was expecting this... just didn't know that '+' wasn't supported
00:37  geirha: Also, some implementations may treat \t as a tab, others may treat it as \ and t
00:38  StFS: geirha: thanks
00:48  paissad: guys, i would like to insert "Disallow: /" and a newline after each pattern of "^User-Agent:" in the file robots.txt
00:48  paissad: 1st of all,  i did this -> sed -i".bak" "aDisallow: /" robots.txt
00:49  paissad: that inserts "Disallow: /" every 2 lines ^^
00:52  paissad: sed -i".bak" "/^User-Agent:/aDisallow: /" robots.txt
00:56  paissad: but i don't know how to insert the newline directly after "Disallow: /"
00:56  paissad: sed -i".bak" -e "/^User-Agent:/aDisallow: /" -e /^Disallow:/a robots.txt
00:56  paissad: but that does not work
01:13  paissad: hmm, i'm progressing ^^, here is what i did
01:13  paissad: sed  -e "/^User-Agent:/aDisallow: /\n" robots.txt
01:13  paissad: but i don't understand the reason why it does not match all patterns
01:14  paissad: help please
01:14  paissad: here is the output http://dpaste.com/275291/
01:14  paissad: thanks in advance
01:15  paissad: at line 319, there isn't changes anylonger
01:19  Riviera: paissad: Please explain what you want to do
01:19  paissad: Riviera, i want to insert "Disallow: /" and a newline after each pattern "^User-Agent:"
01:20  paissad: Riviera, the matter is that from line 319 to the end of the text, there are no changes ^^
01:20  Riviera: paissad: on the next lines, the lines following each "User-Agent:" line, right?
01:20  paissad: yes,
01:21  Riviera: sed '/^User-Agent:/a\
01:21  Riviera: Disallow: /'
01:21  Riviera: err.
01:21  Riviera: Disallow: '
01:21  Riviera: :)
01:21  Riviera: Ah, NO :D
01:21  Riviera: the first was correct, hell :)
01:21  paissad: :)
01:21  Riviera: sed '/^User-Agent:/a\
01:21  Riviera: Disallow: /'
01:21  Riviera: If you want to have a newline after the Disallow: /, then it's like this:
01:22  Riviera: sed '/^User-Agent:/a\
01:22  Riviera: Disallow: /\
01:22  Riviera: '
01:22  paissad: ok, and what's wrong with this ? -> sed  -e "/^User-Agent:/aDisallow: /\n" robots.txt
01:23  Riviera: I don't know, using the a command like that is GNU-specific and I have no clue how that is supposed to work, especially in combination with "\n"
01:24  Riviera: If you use sed from bash, ksh or zsh, you can write my version of the command in a single line like that:
01:24  Riviera: oh, hehe :)
01:24  Riviera: it's quite obvious why your command does not work from line 319.
01:24  Riviera: You search for
01:24  Riviera: User-Agent
01:25  Riviera: your file contains (from line 319)
01:25  Riviera: User-agent
01:25  Riviera: :)
01:25  Riviera: The agent's a looks different ;)
01:25  Riviera: So:
01:26  Riviera: sed $'/^User-[Aa]gent:/a\\\nDisallow: \\\n'
01:30  paissad: oh sorry, i did not see the a instead of A , indeed, it's obvious !!
01:30  paissad: at line 319
01:30  Riviera: :)
01:30  paissad: so my command worked !
01:31  paissad: yours too of course
01:31  Riviera: yes, yours was correct :)
01:34  paissad: sed -i".bak" -e "s/User-agent/User-Agent/" -e "/^User-Agent:/aDisallow: /\n" robots.txt
01:35  paissad: done, thanks
01:38  Riviera: :)

21:33  omes: how do i make a regex in sed where it return everything before a certain combination of characters?
21:34  The-Compiler: sed 's/chars.*//'
21:34  omes: Lots of text here Start text: this is the beginning, and this is the end! end here! more text
21:34  omes: i want it to return everything from "Start text:" to "end here!"
21:34  The-Compiler: 4# echo 'one two three four five six seven' | sed 's/four.*//'
21:34  shbot: The-Compiler: one two three
21:35  omes: this may be repated multiple times throughout the whole text
21:35  The-Compiler: hmm, then it's getting tricky.
21:35  omes: i want it to return each one using global
21:35  omes: yes, i couldn't do ^ based on multiple chars :(
21:35  The-Compiler: how exactly would the real input look like?
21:35  omes: [^] i mean
21:36  omes: you're just gonna start yelling at me.. :P
21:36  omes: It's html
21:36  The-Compiler: actually I parsed HTMLs with sed as well
21:36  The-Compiler: but there are really ways which are way more simple.
21:36  omes: i want it to parse everything between <p> and </p> i have the regex for that, just need it to return everything between them
21:37  omes: basically i want to know how i can use [^<char here>] with multiple chars in a sequence
21:37  taylanub: which is impossible, from what i know
21:37  omes: where <char here> are the chars you don't want it to match
21:38  omes: taylanub: yeah, i don't know the regex syntax of sed too well :(
21:38  omes: it's doable in perl and php though
21:38  omes: so i just wanted to try my luck here :)
21:38  taylanub: it's Basic Regular Expressions, omes. but implementations support more than that
21:39  taylanub: e.g. using \|, \?, \+ are nonstandard
21:39  taylanub: you might have a "man 7 regex" manpage
21:39  omes: yeah, i'm using ? for it in php
