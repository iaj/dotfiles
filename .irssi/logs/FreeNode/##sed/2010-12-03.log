21:42  waldner: nice GNU sed bug
21:42  waldner: 4# echo 'a^c' | sed -e 's/\x5e/b/'
21:42  shbot: waldner: ba^c
21:44  geirha: heh
21:45  geirha: 4# echo 'a^c' | sed -e 's/\^/b/'
21:45  shbot: geirha: abc
21:45  geirha: 4# echo 'a^c' | sed -e 's/\\\x5e/b/'
21:45  shbot: geirha: a^c
21:45  geirha: Hm. Confusing.
21:47  gniourf_gniourf: 4# echo 'a^c' | sed -e $'s/\\\x5e/b/'
21:47  shbot: gniourf_gniourf: abc
21:47  gniourf_gniourf: \o/
21:51  geirha: sh# echo 'a^c' | sed -e $'s/\\\x5e/b/'
21:51  shbot: geirha: a^c
21:51  geirha: :P
21:53  gniourf_gniourf: of course
22:24  vardomescro: hi all. where would I go to learn why sed -e "/^-/s|$| $plaf|" works? in particular, the pipes and the s command in the middle?
22:26  waldner: why shouldn't it work?
22:26  waldner: you can use any character for s
22:27  waldner: s/foo/bar/ or s|foo|bar| are the same
22:27  vardomescro: it works quite well, i just don't know why :D
22:27  waldner: the assumption there is that $plaf doesn't contain pipes itself
22:27  waldner: and doesn't contain other characters that are special to sed like & or \
22:28  vardomescro: oic. ty.
22:29  waldner: np
