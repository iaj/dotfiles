15:32  CyberCr33p: how can I add a string a the end of a line that starts with a specific word?
15:32  jwillia3:  /^word/s/$/string/
15:33  CyberCr33p: thanks

16:17  CyberCr33p: what does sed /g means ?
16:17  CyberCr33p: is for add text ?
16:18  jwillia3: ...is /g supposed to be an argument?
16:18  jwillia3: or do you mean s///g
16:19  CyberCr33p:  "/^${email}/s/$/,${emailforwarding}/g"
16:19  CyberCr33p: I use this
16:20  CyberCr33p: ${email} and ${emailforwarding} are variables which contain two e-mails
16:20  jwillia3: so s///g
16:20  CyberCr33p: yes it works
16:20  CyberCr33p: thanks
16:20  jwillia3: g means replace multiple times on the line
16:20  CyberCr33p: wait
16:20  CyberCr33p: I just want to add ,user@gmail.com
16:21  CyberCr33p: at the end of the line
16:21  CyberCr33p: the line is:
16:21  jwillia3: stop
16:21  CyberCr33p: user@domain.com user@gmail.com
16:21  CyberCr33p: ok
16:21  jwillia3: CyberCr33p, g does nothing on that line, you cannot match $ twice
16:22  CyberCr33p: so what is better to have there?
16:22  jwillia3: nothing.
16:22  CyberCr33p: or nothing ?
16:22  CyberCr33p: ok
16:22  CyberCr33p: thanks
