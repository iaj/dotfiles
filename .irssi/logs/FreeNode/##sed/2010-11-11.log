04:52  LeeRock: How can I remove all leading and trailing whitespace from a file?
04:56  mmckinst: LeeRock: http://www.pement.org/sed/sed1line.txt
04:56  mmckinst: sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//'
04:59  LeeRock: that doesn't work
05:01  LeeRock: that does it for each line.
05:01  LeeRock: I have white before a paragraph starts and after it ends.
05:36  ds_shadof: i have string, need to grep some part of it
06:17  transue: Anyone know how to do a search and replace but replace with newlines in sed?
06:22  jwillia3: s/XXX/\n/
06:35  transue: jwillia3: That didn't work for me, it just does n
06:36  transue: jwillia3: E.g. echo "1-2-3-4-5" | sed 's/-/\n/g' results in 1n2n3n4n5
06:38  jwillia3: transue, hit enter where you see \n
06:38  transue: jwillia3: I tried that too : (
06:39  jwillia3: never knew sed was sensitive to lines, actually.
06:39  jwillia3: if the pattern is only one character, use tr.
06:40  jwillia3: transue, what sed are you using?
06:41  transue: Not sure... but I'm using SunOS 5.10... I know I hate it too
06:41  transue: It's for a class, I normally use GNU/Linux and I normally don't get on IRC asking people to do my homework...
06:41  transue: jwillia3: This is but one line from a larger program.
06:43  jwillia3: transue, put \ before the newline
06:44  transue: jwillia3: okay
06:45  transue: jwillia3: sweet jesus it worked!  Now how can I put that in a script?
06:45  jwillia3: transue, the same way
06:46  transue: jwillia3: Ugh, I was afraid you were going to say that... it's so ugly mixed in with my perfectly tabbed commands else where...

16:31  TripMine: I was asked to replace the all occurences of - in the output of of (ls -lR) to an "r" for some reason $[-] is not picking it up correctly
16:40  gnubien: TripMine: echo "-rw-r----- 1 cm325a02 cm325a 0 Sep 20 14:56 almonds" |sed '/^-/s/-//'  #prints: rw-r----- 1 cm325a02 cm325a 0 Sep 20 14:56 almonds
16:43  TripMine: gnubien, Thanks for jogging my memory. I transposed the $ for the ^
16:43  gnubien: TripMine sure, have fun
17:21  dniz0r: good afternoon all,..  i was hoping someone could help me with this expression,..  i am trying to capture and parse all ips from a DNS zone file,.. the  line looks like  www.domain.com  A   12.12.11.11   ,.. so im jus ttrying to get the 12.12.11.11    ,.. what im using is 'sed -n 's/[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}/1/''      im trying to use 1 as a back refernce  but its just replace all ips with the 1
17:22  guther: dniz0r: \1
17:25  dniz0r: i tried tha
17:25  dniz0r: tand got :sed: 1: "s/[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{ ...": \1 not defined in the RE"
17:26  guther: put braces round ur ip
17:26  guther: s/\([0-9].....\)
17:44  guther: dniz0r: if ur sed supports extended regex (-r) u might shorten it up to: sed -r 's|^[^0-9]*([0-9]{1,3}(.[0-9]{1,3}){3}).*|\1|'
