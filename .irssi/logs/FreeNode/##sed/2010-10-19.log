06:56  jwillia3: awknsed, use sed 's/src=/\nsrc=/'
06:57  jwillia3: awknsed, actually sed 's/src=/\nsrc=/g'
06:57  jwillia3: sed -n 's/.*src="\(.*-upload-.*\)".*/\1/p'
06:58  jwillia3: will print each url that matches
06:58  awknsed: ok will try
07:00  awknsed: When I do this I get all the text after the URL too somehow
07:01  awknsed: I would need the text contained in the bracket in the file1 printed in file2 on separate line
07:01  jwillia3: what?
07:02  awknsed: I downloaded the source code of http://blogue.virtu-oz.com/ in a file called file1
07:03  awknsed: I'm trying to extract the .png URL in a file called file2
07:04  jwillia3: ...
07:04  awknsed: but only *.png the file located in the *upload/2010/10/ URLs
07:05  jwillia3: you're not making sense.
07:05  awknsed: I wish my english was better.
07:06  jwillia3: what is file2? a list of URLs?
07:07  awknsed: file2 must contain the output
07:07  awknsed: a list of URLs, yes.
07:08  awknsed: with all URL contained in file1 that point to a src"" containing the upload keyword
07:08  jwillia3: so you're trying to print all the urls like upload/2010/10/*.png ?
07:08  awknsed: exactly!!
07:09  jwillia3: ok
07:11  jwillia3: sed 's/src=/\nsrc=/g' file1 | sed -n 's:.*href="\(upload/2010/10/.*[.]png\)".*:\1:" >file2
07:13  awknsed: hrm, it's not generating an outfile but brings me into a prompt
07:14  TheBonsai: into a PS2
07:14  TheBonsai: unbalanced quotes
07:14  awknsed: do I need to add a ' after 1 ?
07:15  jwillia3: the last " should be a '
07:16  awknsed: file2 is empty
07:22  awknsed: :/
07:22  jwillia3: hold on
07:26  jwillia3: sed 's/src=/\nsrc=/g' file1 | sed -n 's:.*src="\([^"]*uploads/2010/10/[^"]*[.]png\)".*:\1:p'>file2
07:27  awknsed: wow
07:27  awknsed: worked :)
07:27  awknsed: Thanks a lot jwillia3
07:28  awknsed: It's -really- appreciated
07:28  jwillia3: np.
07:28  awknsed: I never would have found it myself
07:29  awknsed: :):)

10:45  iaj: does sed able to do the vim's v command?   and I got a line in my vim which looks like that,     %s/^From\(.*\n\)\{6}.*ausgetragen\_.\{-}eMail.*: \(.*\)/someRandomString!\2\r/g
10:45  iaj: can I convert that into SED?

12:17  cousteau`work: will `sed -i.old` create a backup even if there's no match?
12:17  cousteau`work: this is, if the original file isn't modified?
12:23  faLUCE: hi, how can I remove all the files in /my/dir with a name that contains "mystring" ?
12:24  cousteau`work: I'd use find
12:25  cousteau`work: find /my/dir -name '*mystring*' -delete   or   find /my/dir -name '*mystring*' -exec rm '{}' +   (keep in mind that '*mystring*' is a glob and not a regex)
12:39  geirha: Or just  rm /my/dir/*mystring*
12:40  faLUCE: thanks all

16:37  wieshka: hey folks - how i can quickly convert negatvie decimal number (-9) to +9 (with sign)
16:37  wieshka: so basicly, if decimal number is -9 it should be converted as +9, and for example +7 as -7
16:46  e-DIO-t: sed -e 's/-/+/' ?
16:47  e-DIO-t: ah .....no sorry, missing the other part :P
16:47  gnubien: wieshka: echo "-9 +9 +7 -7" |sed 's/+[0-9]\+/-&/g' |sed 's/-[0-9]\+/+&/g' |sed 's/-+/-/g' |sed 's/+-/+/g' #prints +9 -9 -7 +7
16:48  jetole_: Hey guys. Is there a way to match more then one word in a s/// expression like how with perl I can do (car|boat|train) to match either car, boat or train?
16:48  gnubien: jetole_: car\|boat\|train

19:04  patricktomkin: how can I change "mail 14400 IN A 192.168.1.101" to "mail	14400	IN	CNAME domain.com"
19:04  patricktomkin: domain.com is a variable
19:05  jwillia3: patricktomkin, you just want to change A 192.168.1.101 to CNAME domain.com?
19:06  patricktomkin: yes
19:06  patricktomkin: but there will spaces or tabs
19:06  jwillia3: where, between A and 1?
19:07  patricktomkin: yes. there could be uneven spaces
19:08  jwillia3: sed "s/A 192[.]168[.]1[.]101/CNAME $YOURVARIABLE/"

19:21  patricktomkin: thanks jwillia3
19:22  jwillia3: np
19:27  patricktomkin: doesn't variation of space affect sed scripts ?
19:28  jwillia3: oh, sorry, i completely forgot about that!
19:28  jwillia3: sed "s/A[ \t][ \t]*192[.]168[.]1[.]101/CNAME $YOURVARIABLE/"
19:50  patricktomkin: Thank you very much. Worked without brackets though
19:51  jwillia3: brackets?
19:51  jwillia3: the quotes you mean?
20:18  patricktomkin: [ ]
20:19  jwillia3: technically yes because . means accept any character
20:55  albacker: how do i pass <([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)\b[^>]*>(.*?)</\1>  (remove html tags) to sed ?
20:55  albacker: cat file.html | sed s/<([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)\b[^>]*>(.*?)</\1> //
20:56  albacker: didn't work.
20:56  jwillia3: use quotes.
20:57  albacker: didn't work neither
20:57  waldner: .*? isn't sed either
20:57  waldner: and \b, though gnu sed may like it
20:57  waldner: and escape brackets
20:58  waldner: and escape the / in the code
20:59  albacker: ok, so this should work right ? sed s/"<\([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*\)\b[^>]*>(.*)<\/\1>"/\2/
20:59  waldner: nope
21:00  waldner: unless you really have literal ( and ) in the tag
21:00  waldner: as the content
21:00  waldner: so you want \(.*\)
21:00  waldner: but that is greedy and will most likely match too much
21:01  albacker: im sure i have 2 tags per line.
21:01  albacker: opening and closing tags.
21:01  waldner: in that case it may work
21:01  waldner: if each line is <foo>something</foo> only
21:02  albacker: yes,
21:02  albacker: well A-Z im replacing that by .*
21:02  albacker: and i have to add an extra \ before \2 otherwise it just shows 2.. hmm
21:03  waldner: you still haven't quoting right
21:03  waldner: just put the whole thing in single quotes and forget it
21:03  albacker: sed s/"<\(.*\)\b[^>]*>\(.*\)<\/\1>"/\\2/
21:03  albacker: ah ok
21:03  albacker: :) thanks
21:04  waldner: the 's/..../.../' part

21:42  Synthead: is there a way to have sed handle a line-delineated stream of text as one "line"?
21:45  waldner: you have to slurp it in memory
21:45  Synthead: how would I do that?
21:45  waldner: sed ':a;$!{N;ba;}; ...here it's a single line...'
21:53  Synthead: hmm
21:53  Synthead: also, can I use sed against varibles, or am I stuck doing echo | sed ?
21:54  waldner: do you want to use sed on the contents of a variable, or you want to use a variabe in a sed script?
21:54  waldner: for the first, either echo | sed or sed <<<"$variable" (for shells that support it)
21:55  Synthead: waldner: contents of a varible
21:55  Synthead: waldner: ooh, nice shortcut
21:55  waldner: ^^
21:55  Synthead: # echo hello world
21:55  Synthead: 4# echo hello world
21:55  shbot: Synthead: hello world
21:55  waldner: or you can use a here-document but it's longer
21:56  Synthead: 4# a=12345; sed 's/5//' <<"$a"
21:56  shbot: Synthead: Missing terminating quote, bracket or keyword
21:56  Synthead: 4# a=12345; sed 's/5//' <<<"$a"
21:56  shbot: Synthead: 1234
21:56  Synthead: :)
21:56  Synthead: why three < ?
21:57  waldner: because two is for here documents
21:57  waldner: and one is for normal redirection
21:57  Synthead: ah, that's right
21:57  Synthead: ohhhhh
21:57  Synthead: so I'm creating a here document with "$a" in this case and sending the output to sed, much like piping it via echo
21:58  waldner: it's called a here string, I think
21:58  waldner: it's different from here documents
21:58  Synthead: I seeee, very nice!
21:58  waldner: man bash has all the details (or what shell you us)
21:58  waldner: *use
21:58  Synthead: I improve my scripting syntax everytime I hop on these channels :)
21:58  Synthead: thank you so much
21:58  waldner: np
22:01  Synthead: 4# echo -n "oh also I heard that "; echo -n `echo "this type of syntax "`; echo -n "has been deprecated in favor of "; echo -n "$(echo "this type")"; echo -n ", am I right?"
22:01  shbot: Synthead: oh also I heard that this type of syntaxhas been deprecated in favor of this type, am I right?
22:02  waldner: it's not officially deprecated, but the latter has some advantages that usually make it preferrable
22:03  waldner: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
22:25  jetole_: Does anyone know how I can make a character repeat x number of times in sed?
22:40  waldner: 4# echo a | sed '/a\{10\}/!{s/^/a/;b;}'
22:40  shbot: waldner: aa
22:40  waldner: ah right
22:40  waldner: 4# echo a | sed ':a;/a\{10\}/!{s/^/a/;ba;}'
22:40  shbot: waldner: aaaaaaaaaa
22:43  waldner: 4# echo a | sed ':a;/.\{20\}/!{s/^./&/;ba;}'
22:43  shbot: waldner: no output within the time limit
22:43  waldner: 4# echo a | sed ':a;/.\{20\}/!{s/^./&&/;ba;}'
22:43  shbot: waldner: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
