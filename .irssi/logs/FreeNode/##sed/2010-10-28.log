00:00  mooneyj: I removed the quotes from the filenames, aswell as changing the separator and it works
00:19 --- galaxywatcher_ is now known as galaxywatcher
03:19  dangerous77: Anyone know how I could go about getting rid of lines 3, 4, 5 from http://pastebin.com/sSuz1r7a ... basically I want the first column to be unique ... it is sorted by the first column, and within that, by the second column (time and date)
03:19  dangerous77: I know sed has multiline stuff, if I could match the lines which have a "matching" line above, then I could put some text into that line that I could then pipe to grep -v
03:22  mgriffin: i dont know how to do it in sed but with mysql it would be trivial, you didnt specify which record to keep in cases of a duplicate however
03:25  dangerous77: I actually grokked that from an apache log not from a database
03:25  dangerous77: I could also just make a perl / php / python script to do it too
03:25  dangerous77: just when I realise I don't know how to do something, it bugs me
03:25  dangerous77: mostly I just use sed / awk / grep for this kind of thing should be able to do it :)
03:55  guther: dangerous77: how'bout uniq?
03:59  guther: ..or if it has to sed, this might work: 'h;:b;$b;N;/^\(......\).*\1/{g;bb;};$b;P;D'
04:01  guther: or: 'h;:b;$b;N;/^\([^ ]\).*\1/{g;bb;};$b;P;D' <= to make the 1st field uniqe.
04:06  palhmbs: I have a little problem I'm working out... --- http://pastebin.com/2AMVNzs8
04:06  palhmbs: I want to wget a certain image from a website based on a timestamp comparison
04:17  guther: hmm - in case of -gt u could do DESIREDLINE=$(($(sed -n "/$DATA2READ/=" /tmp/finalpics.txt)-1))
04:18  tengulre: how to using sed print lines 1000 to 2000 in file a?
04:25  virus_found: tengulre: sed -n '1000,2000p' a
04:25  virus_found: But I reckon, there are simplier ways.
04:34  mgriffin: tengulre: probably you want something like sed -n '1000,2000p;2001q' file
04:37  tengulre: I want to print lines 1000 to 2000 in file a , then output file b and append line seq no. how to do?
04:41  tengulre: the file b like:    1, TEXTA
04:41  tengulre:                                2, TEXTB
04:41  tengulre:                              3,TXT
04:41  tengulre: and so on.
06:06  gpled: this worked, but put an extra space on the next line
06:06  gpled: sed -e "s/\./\.\\n/g" book4.txt >book5.txt
06:07  gpled: hmm, wait, think i know why

14:12  virus_found: How do I get a text between () ? Could be either one lined, or multilined.
14:13  virus_found: (text) or (text end-of-line text end-of-line text ...)
14:13  virus_found: I, ineed, have no problems with onelined.)
14:18 * virus_found always sucks, when it comes to creating rules for more than one line.
14:22  waldner: how many (...) things do you have in your input?
14:22  waldner: are they nested?
14:25 --- sitaktif is now known as sitaktif__
14:29 --- sitaktif_ is now known as sitaktif
14:29  virus_found: waldner: I'll just show you a few examples.
14:31 --- sitaktif__ is now known as sitaktif_
14:32  virus_found: waldner: http://sprunge.us/ATVg
14:33  waldner: is either of those the complete input to sed?
14:33  virus_found: waldner: yes.
14:34  waldner: then you can just do sed ':a;$!{n;ba;};s/.*(//;s/).*//' assuming no other brackets appear elsewhere
14:34  virus_found: Sorry :( I'm not correct.
14:34  waldner: paste a real input then
14:34  virus_found: There are other brackets in the input, but they are on other lines.
14:35  waldner: you need only those following makedepend then?
14:35  virus_found: Ye)
14:35  virus_found: s
14:35  waldner: sed ':a;$!{n;ba;};s/.*makedepend *(//;s/).*//' may still work
14:35  virus_found: waldner:  http://sprunge.us/IHCS
14:35  virus_found: :)
14:36  waldner: right
14:36  waldner: makedepends above, not makedepend
14:36  waldner: but except that it should work
14:36  virus_found: Oh thank you generously.
14:37  waldner: seems it doesn't work on your sample
14:38  virus_found: waldner: Ehm, but it won't work. Tried with that input, I gave a link to.
14:38  waldner: let me see
14:38  waldner: uep
14:38  waldner: yes, it's N;a; not n;a;
14:38  virus_found: waldner: but also the first link is applicable.
14:38  waldner: change that and it works
14:38  virus_found: Ok.
14:38  waldner: er, n;ba;
14:38  virus_found: N;ba?
14:38  waldner: argh
14:38  waldner: N;ba;
14:38  virus_found: :)
14:38  waldner: yes
14:39 --- andrey1 is now known as krizz
14:39  waldner: still, something tells me that even that isn't really what you want as final output
14:39  virus_found: -_- yes
14:39  virus_found: Won't work.
14:40  waldner: so what do you wont as output?
14:40  waldner: *want
14:40 * waldner kicks the keyboard
14:40  virus_found: 'boost' 'sane' 'perl-archive-zip' 'zip' 'unzip' 'xulrunner' 'unixodbc' 'hsqldb-java'
14:40  virus_found:              'apache-ant' 'gperf' 'poppler' 'kdelibs' 'gconf' 'openjdk6' 'cppunit'
14:40  virus_found:      'beanshell'  'vigra' 'libldap' 'lucene' 'libmythes' 'junit' 'libwpg' 'imagemagick'
14:40  virus_found:      # for additional ooo-build features
14:40  virus_found:      'mesa>=7.5' 'gstreamer0.10-base>=0.10.26'  'mono>=2.6.1'
14:41  waldner: that's exactly what I get
14:41  virus_found: Oh, sorry for flood:)
14:41  virus_found: Really?
14:41  virus_found: Hm.
14:41  waldner: yes
14:41  waldner:  sed ':a;$!{N;ba;};s/.*makedepends=*(//;s/).*//'
14:41  waldner: actually, the star is useless so maybe sed ':a;$!{N;ba;};s/.*makedepends *= *(//;s/).*//'
14:42  waldner: depends on whether there can be spaces around the =
14:42  virus_found: Nope, it can't be.
14:42  virus_found: Then sed ':a;$!{N;ba;};s/.*makedepends=(//;s/).*//' ?
14:43  waldner: yes
14:43  waldner: (mine allowed for no spaces either, but nevermind)
14:43  virus_found: Btw, "makedepends" is always on the first position of the line. Maybe ^ somewhere?
14:43  waldner: no, because that's a multiline thing
14:43  virus_found: Ah, I see.
14:43  waldner: so perhaps \nmakedepends
14:44  waldner: unless it's the very first line in the file, in which case that will fail
14:44  virus_found: I see.
14:44  waldner: if there are no chances for false matches, I'd just leave it alone
14:44  virus_found: Thank you so very much, waldner! :)
14:44  waldner: yw
14:44  virus_found: I could write the thing myself.
14:44  virus_found: couldn't!
14:52  waldner: gnu sed has a switch to make ^ match in multiline IIRC
14:53  waldner: so that'd become sed ':a;$!{N;ba;};s/.*^makedepends=(//m;s/).*//' (untested)
14:54  waldner: doesn't seem to be working
14:54  virus_found: waldner: I'm glad with \n ;)
14:55  waldner: cool

21:57  chasep_work: is there any way to do a replacement where Abc would be replaced with Xyz, and abc with xyz, and ABC with XYZ?
22:11  ka1ser: just those specific patterns or basically transforming any a to x, A to X, b to y, B to Y, c to z, C to Z?
22:12  ka1ser: in the second case, sed 'y/abcABC/xyzXYZ/' might work
22:13  ka1ser: for first case I think you need specifically call three commands
23:30  redcsc: sup
