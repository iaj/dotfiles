10:40  araujo: hello guys
10:40  araujo: if I want to test for a line that contains only one specific word and the rest of the line are whitespace chars , how can it be done?
10:48  waldner: test for /^[[:blank:]]*word[[:blank:]]*$/ maybe
11:00  araujo: thanks waldner , that seems to make it
11:00  araujo: waldner, do you know a nice tutorial to go through some of these "obscures" sed options?
11:00  araujo: :P

17:54  evenflow: hey, how do i tell sed to replace lines where the first word is bla but there is a space before it, ^bla wont work
17:55  waldner: /^ bla/
17:56  evenflow: will that take any amount of space before bla?
17:57  evenflow: ok i need to provide the correct amount of spaces
17:57  evenflow: thanks
17:58  waldner: to allow variable amount, use /^ *bla/ or /^  *bla/
17:58  waldner: (0 or more and one or more)
17:58  TheBonsai: consider using [[:space:]]\{1,\}, if applicable
17:58  waldner: yes that's better as it also catches tabs
17:58  waldner: [[:blank:]] probably rather than [[:space:]] though
18:00  evenflow: great, thanks.
18:00  TheBonsai: ah, [:space:] contains the vertical stuff

22:45  vbmanu: hi allo
22:45  vbmanu: all
22:46  vbmanu: i need to replay #HOHOME="~/.hattrickorganizer" with HOHOME="~/.hattrickorganizer". What is the command?
22:54  dualbus: vbmanu, what do you mean by replay
22:55  FernandoBasso: vbmanu: This:  sed 's/^#HOHOME/HOHOME/' file.txt ?
22:56  dualbus: echo  '#HOHOME="~/.hattrickorganizer"' | sed 's/^#//'
22:57  FernandoBasso: Much better and clever! :)
22:58  vbmanu: i resolved with sed 's/^#HOHOME=\"~\/.hattrickorganizer\"/HOHOME=\"~\/.hattrickorganizer\"/'
23:01  dualbus: vbmanu, you can use other chars instead of /, like  sed -r 's:^#(HOHOME="~/.hattrickorganizer"):\1:'
