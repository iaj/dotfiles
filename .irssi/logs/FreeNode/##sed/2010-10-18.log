01:28  virus_found: Hello. How do I move a line, that contains "cr", down (so it becomes a line number n+1), and the line below it - up (n-1). Simply put, exchange them.
01:30  virus_found: line line crrrr line line      becomes      line line line crrrr line

01:32  geirha: There's probably a better way to do this, but: sed -n '/cr/{h;n;p;x;p;t}; /cr/!p'
01:34  Parabola: i dont have a question, i just have to say, its amazing how complex this app is, so much so that theres a channel devoted to it
01:34  virus_found: It worked, thanks aa lot.
01:35  virus_found: geirha: quite a mighty command here...
01:36  geirha: Once you run ''man sed'' and see what all those one-letter commands does, you'll probably see what it does.
01:36  Parabola: did you reference anything when you wrote that?
01:36  Parabola: or was that from memory
01:37  geirha: memory. There aren't that many commands to remember.
01:37  Parabola: fair enough, i've been reading about regex and sed for a good chunk of today :)
01:37  Parabola: my brain hurts a bit
01:39  geirha: But looking at the man-page now, I see the 't' should've been a 'b'
01:40  virus_found: geirha: it works even without t
01:40  virus_found: and b
01:40  geirha: Ah, right
01:42  virus_found: I just wonder, what that part does in the end    /cr/!p         man doesn't even contain "!"s
01:43  geirha: It negates
01:43  geirha: /cr/p  if line mathces /cr/, print it.  /cr/!p  if the line does NOT match /cr/, print it
01:44  virus_found: I see. I thought about negating another thing in the first time.
01:44  virus_found: Thanks a lot.
01:45  geirha: sed -n '/cr/{x;n;p;x;p;b};p'
01:45  geirha: There, now the b makes a difference.
01:46  geirha: Maybe h and g make more sense. sed -n '/cr/{h;n;p;g;p;b};p'
01:47  virus_found: It's too difficult for my mind. What's the prefered command of those three?
01:48  geirha: I dunno, I'm not that good with sed :P. I'd go for the latter, though they should all do the same.
01:49  virus_found: Ok.
01:51  geirha: if line matches /cr/, (h) copy it to hold space, (n) read next line to pattern space, (p) print pattern space, (g) copy hold space back to pattern space, (p) print pattern space, (b) skip the rest; do the next line of input
01:55  virus_found: Thanks for clarification. I'm playing with all those command letters in a test printf input. The best way to learn and memorize :)

07:43  kaushal: hi
07:44  kaushal: I have the first line ^@^@^@^@^@^@Processing ContactImport at 01-10-2010 02-50-27 in around 200 files
07:45  kaushal: is there a way to delete ^@ in all the 200 files ?
07:50  jwillia3: ^@ is NUL bytes, so no.
07:50  jwillia3: maybe tr can do it for you
07:52  kaushal: jwillia3: any example ?
07:53  jwillia3: tr -d\0
07:54  kaushal: ok
07:55  kaushal: jwillia3: so tr -d\0 file ?
07:55  jwillia3: kaushal, no, have you /tried/ looking at man tr or google?
08:00  kaushal: jwillia3: I tried
08:01  kaushal: cat file | tr -d\0 > newfile
08:02  jwillia3: tr -d \0 <src >dst
08:05  kaushal: jwillia3: it did not worked
08:05  kaushal: still i have the same characted ^@ in the newfile
08:05  jwillia3: kaushal, use cat to find out if ^@ is really two characters or NUL
08:06  kaushal: not sure i understand that
08:08  jwillia3: try sed 's/\^@//g'
08:08  kaushal: ok
08:12  kaushal: i did sed 's/\^@//g' file > newfile
08:12  kaushal: it still has the same characters ^@
08:13  jwillia3: kaushal, http://dpaste.org
08:14  jwillia3: kaushal, http://dpaste.com
08:15  kaushal: jwillia3: do you want me to pastebin the content of the file ?
08:15  jwillia3: yes, kaushal
08:15  kaushal: ok

08:37  phil_in_london: http://pastebin.com/0jL20zMx   I'm trying to extract just the Subject out of that file, can anyone lend a hand?
08:38  jwillia3: phil_in_london, sed -n 's/^Subject: //p'
12:18  Guest99466: http://pastebin.org/287095
12:18  Guest99466: i need to cut out the content out of this file
12:18  Guest99466: a html file
12:18  Guest99466: how do I realize this with sed?
12:19  Guest99466: I thought about something like "search for pattern (e.g. <body>) strip out everything above pattern, search for next pattern (e.g. </body>) and strip the following line after that pattern til end of the file

19:11  metalx2000: Hello, I know that  --   sed "/string/d" file.txt   --  will delete any line from file.txt that contains "string", how can I get it to delete only the fist line it find with that string instead of all of them?

19:51  benny99: hi, is there a filter option for sed, so I do not replace certain words, but print only certain words ?
20:26  hemanth: which the best way to quote and comma each line of a file?
20:26  hemanth: that is each line must be quoted and at the each end of line a comma must be added
20:33  jwillia3: s/.*/"&",/
20:38  hemanth: thanks :)
