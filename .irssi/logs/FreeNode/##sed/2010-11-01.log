05:20  gnychis: how can i replace all CR with LF using sed?  I have tried "sed 's/\r/\n/g' output" but that doesn't seem to work... this works to remove the CR though using tr:  "cat output | tr -d "\r \n""
05:35  jwillia3: gnychis, why must you use sed?
07:36  fluter: hi buddies, is there any way to pass parameters to sed script?
07:55  jwillia3: fluter, no, sed doesn't have variables. use the shell's substitution.
07:56  fluter: jwillia3: thanks, I know now, but why cannot sed have variables?
07:57  jwillia3: fluter, because it has no use for them.
07:57  fluter: jwillia3: no use? parameter subsititution is not using?
07:57  jwillia3: fluter, that is what the shell is for.
07:58  fluter: jwillia3: yes, so I mean sed can have this feature too, then we dont need shell for sed parameters
07:58  jwillia3: why does sed need variables when you can say sed "s/x/$REPL/" ?
07:58  jwillia3: fluter, or they could not duplicate features they don't need to.
07:59  fluter: ok, hence sed script is restricted,
07:59  jwillia3: if that's what helps you sleep at night.
08:01  fluter: no, so we cant write pure sed script if it need parameters
08:01  fluter: we need shell script to wrap it up,
08:02  jwillia3: variables don't vary in sed, so there's no reason for them to be IN sed. Use whatever you're invoking sed with to do the substitution.

09:23  Zeu5: hi there, i am trying to use sed to replace all occurences of a line in my php file over at the server. i used the following http://gist.github.com/657818 but it did not work. please advise.
09:31  Zeu5: its okie i fixed it. thanks
09:35  fluter: how to seperate the sed commands? there are more than one s command
09:36  jwillia3: fluter, ;
09:36  geirha: or -e cmd1 -e cmd2
09:36  fluter: yeah, ; works, thanks
09:39  fluter: jwillia3: shell variables are not expanded in sed script?
09:39  jwillia3: no, shell variables are expanded in the shell.
09:39  fluter: s/\[\[nic\]\]/$NIC/g
09:39  geirha: 4# echo 's/$HOME/foo/' "s/$HOME/foo/"
09:39  shbot: geirha: s/$HOME/foo/ s//root/foo/
09:40  fluter: so how to use $NIC in this place
09:40  geirha: Heh, bad choice of variable ^^
09:40  geirha: the shell does not do any expansion inside '' quotes
09:41  fluter: geirha: I see, so quote sed script with " " is the right to do :)
09:41  geirha: fluter: Yes, and of course make sure the variable doesn't contain any characters special to sed
09:42  geirha: and if it does, escape where needed.
09:42  fluter: geirha: yes, I will take care, thx
09:42  geirha: The $HOME var contained / in my example above, so that would've failed.
09:43  fluter: so "s/\$HOME/foo/" would works
09:45  geirha: That would avoid $HOME from being expanded by the shell
09:46  geirha: You could do "s,$HOME,foo," if you can be certain the var may not contain ,
10:02  kaushal: hi
10:02  kaushal: I have a file which contains around 5 lacs line, I need only the last 1 lac line ?
10:03  kaushal: Any clue ?

18:38  OEXPL: Hello #sed. I want to replace something in a file. so I use sed -e 's/search/replace/g' . But I want to replace "search" with the content of a file. How do I do that? I can't use a simple shell/environment variable because they are not escaped. Does anyone now how I can do it?
18:51  irc2samus: OEXPL just an idea but what about: sed "s/search/$(sed 's/[\/\\]/\\&/g' yourfile)/g"
18:51  irc2samus: not sure how it'll handle the newlines
18:52  irc2samus: I gues it'll be fine since it's quoted
18:52  OEXPL: thx
