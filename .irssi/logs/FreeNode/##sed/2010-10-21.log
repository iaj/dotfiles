20:54  chasep_work: I know how to delete all blank lines at the start of a file, but I want to delete all blank lines and any blanks at the begining of the first non blank line. This is what I've got: sed '1,/./ s/[ \t]//;/./,$!d' IT ALMOST works, except that if the line after the first non blank line also has leading blanks, it will delete ONE of them.
