21:37  blakkheim: hi could someone help me with a bit of text manipulation
21:37  mtdewcmu: sure
21:38  blakkheim: i've got a file that's 159 lines long. i want to search for string "blahblah" on each line, then print that along with the following 15 characters
21:45  mtdewcmu: so you only want to print "blahblah" followed by 15 characters, and nothing else?
21:45  blakkheim: yes, for each line
21:45  mtdewcmu: ignoring lines that don't contain "blahblah"?
21:46  blakkheim: they all do
21:46  mtdewcmu: ok
21:47  mtdewcmu: this should work: sed 's/\(blahblah.\{15\}\).*/\1/'
21:48  blakkheim: and if blahblah has special characters?
21:48  blakkheim: an URL, in my case
21:48  mtdewcmu: if you want to eliminate any prefix, sed 's/.*\(blahblah.\{15\}\).*/\1/'
21:49  mtdewcmu: I don't think any url characters need escaping
21:49  mtdewcmu: except forward slash
21:49  mtdewcmu: \/
21:51  mtdewcmu: try it and let me know what problems you run into
21:51  blakkheim: hmm, it seems to have cut it down a little but there's still extra stuff i don't need
21:51  mtdewcmu: extra stuff where?
21:51  blakkheim: let me try something real quick, i appreciate your help so far
21:52  mtdewcmu: k
21:55  blakkheim: alright, i'm good now, just needed a little changes
21:55  blakkheim: thanks again for your time, saved me a lot of trouble
21:55  mtdewcmu: sweet
21:55  mtdewcmu: np
