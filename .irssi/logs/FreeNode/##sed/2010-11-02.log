15:27  lunaphyte_: hi.  given a file like this - http://dpaste.com/269123/ - how can i truncate (to store as a bash var) the file after the last comment?
15:28  lunaphyte_: something along the lines of "truncate the data after the last line to start with #'?
15:55  waldner: not nice: sed ':a;$!{N;ba;};s/\(.*#[^#\n]*\)\n.*/\1/'
15:55  waldner: needs gnu sed also
15:56  waldner: also sed ':a;/^\([^#][^#\n]*\)\+$/{$d;N;ba;}'
15:57  waldner: s/\\+/*/
16:00  waldner: they both probalby fail in a number of cases though
16:01  lunaphyte_: thanks.
16:02  lunaphyte_: i might be unnecessarily overcomplicating this.  i've got this: sed -n '/^[^#]/,$p'
16:02  lunaphyte_: which works just fine, except it leaves the last blank line preceding the key  value pairs.
16:03  lunaphyte_: but really, i can probably live with that.
17:31  waldner: yes, because [^#] does not match an empty line
