15:08  soroush: cat t.xml | sed 'N;d' only holds the last line! why? N should append. I can't understand the difference between n and N
15:09  Riviera: soroush: sed 'N;d' either outputs the last line or no line at all,
15:09  Riviera: soroush: the former for input that consists of odd numbers of line, the latter for input of even numbers.
15:10  Riviera: 4# printf %s\\n {1..10} | sed 'N;d'
15:10  shbot: Riviera: no output
15:10  Riviera: 4# printf %s\\n {1..9} | sed 'N;d'
15:10  shbot: Riviera: 9
15:10  Riviera: 4# printf %s\\n {1..8} | sed 'N;d'
15:10  shbot: Riviera: no output
15:10  Riviera: 4# printf %s\\n {1..7} | sed 'N;d'
15:10  shbot: Riviera: 7
15:11  Riviera: soroush: n is completely different to N.
15:11  Riviera: soroush: But, well, what do you want ##sed to do for you?
15:11  Riviera: soroush: To explain n and N?
15:11  Riviera: soroush: To solve a problem that is related to 'N;d'?

17:11  Riviera: soroush: and, why did you fail? :)
17:13  soroush: because I didn't know N works only on odd lines
17:13  soroush: :) thanks Riviera I got it
17:14  waldner: it doesn't work only on odd lines
17:14  waldner: it depends on where you use it
17:17  Riviera: soroush: wait a second :)
17:19  soroush: I think my mistake was deleting odd lines so the next line would be again an odd line
17:32  Riviera: no no :)
17:35  Riviera: soroush: N does not only work on odd lines.
