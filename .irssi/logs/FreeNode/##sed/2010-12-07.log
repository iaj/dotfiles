17:01  shane4ubuntu: sed -e 's/^2 //g' file   isn't removing the a line that starts with 2     What did I do wrong?
17:02  shane4ubuntu: my file contains many lines that have 2   and 3   and then other numbers that end with a period, I want to remove only the lines that contain 2 and 3 with no period.
17:07  shane4ubuntu: ohh, nevermind, there isn't a space after the 2 or 3!
17:46  samfisher: hi
17:47  samfisher: how could i use sed to take each word containing the $ from a file and list them in a single new file file
17:49  gnubien: samfisher: might be possible, wait...
17:51  LjL: this expression i need to make confuses me because of sed and bash escaping. i need to replace every instance of any character except \, followed by ', into \'
17:51  LjL: (in other words, i need to escape all unescaped 's)
17:52  samfisher: gnubien: i'll wait, thank you.
17:55  cthuluh: LjL: 's/\([^\\]\)'\''/\1\\'\''/g' # not very well tested
17:56  cthuluh: samfisher: awk might be more friendly for this task
17:59  LjL: thanks
18:00  waldner: LjL: sed "s/\\\\'/\x1/g;s/'/\\\\'/g;s/\x1/\\\\'/g" untested
18:13  gnubien: samfisher: echo "1 2 0\$3 4 5 6 \$777 8 9 10 11" |sed 's/ /\n/g' |sed -n '/\$/p'  #prints only the words with a $ in them
18:15  LjL: for something more complicated... now i need to replace every insteance of %x (where x is any character) in a line with $n%x, where n is an ascending digit that counts the number of times that was found in the line
18:16  LjL: like, "blah blah %s blah blah %d" becomes "blah blah $1%s blah blah $2%d"
18:27  samfisher: gnubien: thank you so much
18:27  gnubien: samfisher sure, have fun
18:28  samfisher: gnubien: if i want to apply that command to an entire folder i'll have to : for i in file do 'the command' > file.txt?
18:29  gnubien: samfisher: sed 's/ /\n/g' filename |sed -n '/\$/p' >> newfile
18:31  iaj: gnubien: one question.. filename in that case could be replaced by * for all files in the folder correct? or rather *(.)
18:32  gnubien: iaj: usually, yea
18:33  gnubien: iaj: got weird filenames with spaces or other no alphanumeric char's in them?
18:36  iaj: nah that was just a basic question, heh:-)
18:36  iaj: if sed is taking multiple files as an argument...
18:38  samfisher: gnubien: thank you again
18:38  gnubien: samfisher: sure, have fun ;)
20:00  krisfremen: hmm
20:01  krisfremen: if i do something like sed '/something/!d'
20:01  krisfremen: can i also get the line number that it was on?
20:01  krisfremen: and how would i do that?
20:12  guther: krisfremen: '/sth/!d;='
20:13  krisfremen: ohh, =
20:14  krisfremen: thanks  guther
20:18  guther: yw :)

22:44  cocox: is there a irc chatlog?
22:44  cocox: for this channel?
22:46  yitz_: Not publicly that I know of. But many people here got private logs
22:49  Riviera: cocox: if there is, it would not really be according to freenode guidelines.
23:47  tm512: ok, this might not be the best place for the question but I suppose people here will know: how do I properly echo something that contains an !
23:47  tm512: echo "!" doesnt work
23:47  tm512: echo "\!" prints out \!
23:47  cthuluh: '!'
23:47  cthuluh: ask #bash
23:48  tm512: yeah, thanks
23:53  virus_found: or \!
23:53  Riviera: tm512: set +H
23:54  Riviera: tm512: as another option :)
23:54  guther: 4# echo !
23:54  Riviera: tm512: /msg greybot !!
23:54  shbot: guther: !
23:54  Riviera: funny how /msg greybot ! does not work.
23:57  tm512: so far I got echo ':tm512!tm512@localhost PRIVMSG #main :.uptime' | cut -d : -f 2 | sed -e 's/[:!]/ /g' -e 's/  / /g' -e 's/^ //g'
23:57  tm512: prints tm512 tm512@localhost PRIVMSG #main
23:58  tm512: making a new function that gets those as arguments called "get_privmsg"
