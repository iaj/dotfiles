14:44  user01: hi is there a way if I have a statement repeated "T=1" several times in a text file, to keep the first occurence, replace the second with T=1+1, T=1+2, T=1+3 . . . T=1+i?
14:45  gnubien: maybe
14:45  user01: gnubien: is this more of an awk question?
14:46  gnubien: user01: not sure awk can do it either
14:46  user01: ok
17:57  iwkse: hi, how's possible to duplicate the behavior of grep -o with sed? i'm trying sed -n 's/PATTERN/&/p' but it prints whole the line
18:03  mmckinst: how about
18:03  mmckinst: echo 'foobarbaz' | sed -e 's/[^oz]//g'
18:04  mmckinst: assuming you want only the characters 'o' and 'z' it removes everything that isn't them
18:05  iwkse: mmckinst: it wouldn't work because i need to extract a version number after a word, using a subcontext
18:06  iwkse: i have something like that, bla Version 5.21 bla
18:07  iwkse: i was doing like sed -n 's/Version \([0-9]\.[0-9]+\)/\1/p'
