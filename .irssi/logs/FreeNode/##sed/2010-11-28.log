01:24  Luiji99: I tried running `sed -e 's,/* vim: set sts=2 sw=2 et: */,/* vim: set ts=8 sts=2 sw=2 noet:,' *.h *.c`, but it only printed the contents of all the files I inputted.
01:24  Luiji99: What'd I do wrong?
01:26  jwillia3: Luiji99, sed is a stream editor not a file editor. it doesn't write to your files since it doesn't require any files it outputs to stdout.
01:26  jwillia3: ...nice.

20:35  kingsley: How would you replace lines in one file with the contents of a second file when their first fields match?

22:02  Riviera: kingsley: I probably would rather use awk or join or something else, but most certainly not sed
