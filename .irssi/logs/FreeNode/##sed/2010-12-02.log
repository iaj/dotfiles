18:55  codehotter: hi, I want to double up the \ character whenever it appears inside quotes " ... " but not affect it if it is not inside quotes
18:55  codehotter: can I do this with sed?
19:34 --- imgrey is now known as imgrey_
20:22  jsz`: 4# var='\\test'; [[ $var =~ '\\' ]] && echo "${var/\\/\\\\\\}"
20:22  shbot: jsz`: \\\\test

20:28  geirha: codehotter: Sounds like an odd thing to do, why do you need that?
20:31  jsz`: 4# sed '/\".*[\].*\"/ s/\\/\\\\/g' <<< 'This "\is" a "te\st" for "codehotter\".'
20:31  shbot: jsz`: This "\\is" a "te\\st" for "codehotter\\".
20:41  jsz`: 4# sed -n '/".*[\].*\"/p' <<< 'This "\is" a "te\st" \for "codehotter\".'
20:41  shbot: jsz`: This "\is" a "te\st" \for "codehotter\".
20:41  biberao: hi
20:44  jsz`: hi o/
20:57  jsz`: it works on multiple lines, not one...
21:00  biberao: besides that gnu sed manual
21:00  biberao: you advise anything else?
21:02  jsz`: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
21:02  biberao: thanks
