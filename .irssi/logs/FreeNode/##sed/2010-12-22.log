14:56  mjf: Hi. How do I join lines by first word? Ex.: "A B\nB C\nC D\nA C\nB D\nC E" -> "A B C\nB C D\nC D E"
14:57  mjf: I saw somewhere example how to do it but can not find it again. :(
14:57  geirha: man join
14:57  mjf: wtf? there is really such a command? great. :) thanks
15:06  mjf: Hi again. I was too fast. I do not see the point of using join(1) on single stream.
15:07  mjf: I got one stream containing lines I need to join by the first word. It is assumed that the stream is already sorted by the first word.
15:10  geirha: awk '{k=$1;$1=""; a[k]=a[k] $0} END { for (k in a) print k,a[k] }'
15:11  geirha: I don't know how to do it with sed.
15:28  mjf: geirha: that's ok, the awk works
15:28  mjf: thanks
19:36  albacker: how do i filter all urls from a file?
19:36  yitz_: Google for URL regex and you'll get about 40 different approaches
19:37  albacker: thanks
19:38  albacker: i know how to match a URL with regex, i just dont see how to rip the URLS from a file.
19:38  grop: albacker, grep -o http://.* # or whatever regexâ€¦
19:40  albacker: thanks
19:40  albacker: -o was what iwas missing :)
19:41  yitz_: Assuming one per line, you could do: 's/.*regex// ; s/regex.*// ; p'
19:41  yitz_: But the GNU grep -o is nifty
20:35  pyoor: Is there anyway to do something similar to grep -o in sed?
20:35  pyoor: nvm, I asked too soon.
