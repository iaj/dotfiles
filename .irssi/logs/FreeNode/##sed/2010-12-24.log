06:21  variable: is there is a way to get the same effect of sed without a /s -- but with the *last* character instead of the first without piping thru reverse and back?
06:21  variable: *without a /g

07:10  probonono: variable, can you be a bit clearer? Perhaps give an example.
07:10  variable: probonono, echo aaa| sed something  | aab
07:11  variable: instead of echo aaa | sed s/a/b/ | baa
07:11 --- yitz__ is now known as yitz_
07:12  probonono: variable, perhaps:  sed 's/a$/b/'
07:12  variable: probonono,  "aab" --> "abb" as well
07:13  variable: I want exactly the same semantics as sed without the /g modifier - but I want it to change the last occurrence instead of the first
07:22  probonono: variable, possibly:  sed 's/\(.*\)a/\1b/'
07:34  variable: probonono, I think that will work for a simple change
07:34  variable: but not for something more complicated - i was hoping for something like "/l" for last or whatever
07:36  variable: probonono, it looks like I would have to grep -c and use /N with the result
07:37 * variable has to leave
