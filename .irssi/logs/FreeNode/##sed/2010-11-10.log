12:49  lnxnt: how do I remove 6 chars in front of every line in a textfile?
12:50  lnxnt: sed 's///g' file
12:52  lnxnt: sed 's/^******//g' file
12:56  lnxnt: sed 's/^......//g' file  works ^^
13:21  paissad: guys, i have a file containing this line
13:21  paissad: RPM_BUILD_ROOT=""
13:21  paissad: i would like to have
13:21  paissad: PKG="/foo/bar" (knowing that PKG=/foo/bar"
13:22  paissad: i did
13:22  paissad: sed -i".bak" -e "s/^RPM_BUILD_ROOT=\"\"/PKG=\"$PKG\"/"
13:23  paissad: but i have this error
13:23  paissad: sed: -e expression #1, char 28: unknown option to `s'
13:24  cthuluh: do you know set -x?
13:24  paissad: trace
13:24  cthuluh: then use it and see what command sed is told to execute
13:26  paissad: cthuluh, ahhhh the / in the path ^^
13:26  paissad: i forgot, .. damn it !
13:27  paissad: cthuluh, thanks
13:28  paissad: another question: .. is there a tip of having some char separator for sed so that we avoid "automatically" to have such errors
13:28  paissad: it seems that i have seen something like that in the past, but not really sure ..
13:29  cthuluh: you can use ~ any character separator, within a 's' command
13:29  geirha: \x01 one of the safer ones.
13:30  cthuluh: I think there was a trick to use a NUL byte, hmmmm
13:30  paissad: geirha, yes i did not ask my question correctly  ... i just wanted to know the safer ways to choose separators !
13:31  geirha: GNU sed might handle NULs, it'll certainly not be portable.

16:44  chasep_work: is there a way to do a relative line number?   sed /pattern/,<next7lines>d for example?
16:52  guther: chasep_work: foo=$(sed '/pattern/=' foo.bar);bar=$(($foo+7));sed -n "$foo,$bar p" foo.bar
16:52  chasep_work: guther: thanks
16:53  guther: but not without shell - you can count on and with sed..but believe me, you don't want to
16:53  guther: yw
16:55  chasep_work: guther: yea, I'm trying to get rid of a block of code from a bunch of files... block ends with } <newlines and tabs> }; I can get it to delete all but the last curly brace, or delete the entire rest of the file...but not just up to and including the last }.
16:55  chasep_work: guther: I found another way to do it
16:56  chasep_work: go the first method, replacing with a unique word not in the files, then run a 2nd pass to go from thta word to the remaining }

21:55  chasep_work: how can I grab (or hold) a subpattern?
21:56  jwillia3: h/H
21:58  chasep_work: yea, but if the line is "function func_name", how can I get just func_name part for use on the next line? /function (.*)/ h;n;\i g'
22:01  jwillia3: printf "abcdef\nq" | sed '/abcdef/ {h; s/.*\(bcd\).*/\1/; x}; /q/{x}'
22:18  chasep_work: http://pastie.org/1288190  that ended up working for what I was trying to do
