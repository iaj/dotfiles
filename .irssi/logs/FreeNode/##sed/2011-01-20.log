17:28  hasan: I wanto to substitute the third comma in a line with sed. how do I realize this?
17:29  rapid: s/,/x/3
17:30  hasan: thanks
17:30  hasan: and how do I cut the rest off?
17:30  hasan: which comes after the third comma
17:31  hasan: like: "foo1,foo2,foo3,BAAAAR" -> "foo1,foo2,foo3"
17:32  hasan: notice, that after the third comma, it is cut
17:32  e36freak: 4# sed 's/\([^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*\),.*/\1/' <<<"foo,bar,baz,blah"
17:32  shbot: e36freak: foo,bar,baz
17:32  e36freak: slightly uglier
17:37  hasan: omg
17:37  hasan: this is easier -> echo foo1,foo2,foo3,acsnoacnoianc,acooacis | sed 's/,/*/3;s/*.*$/ /g'
17:38  e36freak: ...sure
17:38  e36freak: assuming you know 100% that there will never be a "*" in any field
17:42  e36freak: or just
17:43  e36freak: 4# IFS=, read -r a b c _ <<<"foo,bar,baz,some,other,stuff"; printf "%s,%s,%s" "$a" "$b" "$c"
17:43  shbot: e36freak: foo,bar,baz
17:43  e36freak: then you have each in a variable
17:44  e36freak: 4# TIMEFORMAT="real: %E"; time IFS=, read -r a b c _ <<<"foo,bar,baz,some,other,stuff"; printf "%s,%s,%s" "$a" "$b" "$c"
17:44  shbot: e36freak: real: 0.007
17:44  shbot: e36freak: foo,bar,baz
17:44  e36freak: 4# TIMEFORMAT="real: %E"; time sed 's/\([^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*\),.*/\1/' <<<"foo,bar,baz,blah"
17:44  shbot: e36freak: foo,bar,baz
17:44  shbot: e36freak: real: 0.041
17:53  hasan: e36freak: ur crazy my friend.
17:53  e36freak: wat?
17:53  hasan: thank you for sharing this knowledge
