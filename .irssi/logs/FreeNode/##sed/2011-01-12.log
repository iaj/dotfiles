07:01  probonono: hotwings, if you do need to use single-quote delimiters around your command then you can do something like:  sed -n 's/a'"'"'/b/'

23:57  rxMokka: how can I chain together instances of "-e s///" instructions so that the second one, only gets text output by the first? It seems that currently my second "-e s///" is processing the original incoming stream
23:57  vkues: What you want is the default.
23:58  vkues: # sed -e 's/^/M/' -e 's/^/rx/' <<< okka
23:58  vkues: 4# sed -e 's/^/M/' -e 's/^/rx/' <<< okka
23:58  cthuluh: rxMokka: look for the t and T commands
23:58  shbot: vkues: no output within the time limit
23:58  vkues: 4# sed -e 's/^/M/' -e 's/^/rx/' <<< okka
23:58  shbot: vkues: rxMokka
23:58  rxMokka: hmmm, perhaps I should also mention that I'm using -n to get only lines matching my first -e substitution
23:59  vkues: rxMokka: Your wording suggests a misunderstanding in what -n does.
23:59  cthuluh: using -n only means that auto-printing is turned off
23:59  cthuluh: it doesn't mean that the second -e isn't executed
23:59  rxMokka: does -n not affect flow of the stream? only output?
