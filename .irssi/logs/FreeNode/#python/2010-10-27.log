13:16  Alberth: slots help :)     In my automata code (with states, and edges to other states) I can have around a 1e6 states before the machine runs out of memory
13:16  lvh: Alberth: Sure
13:16  lvh: Alberth: But I really think you should make it break without slots before resorting to slots
13:17  Alberth: it did

13:21  lvh: fliebel: Of what?
13:21  fliebel: lvh: Pixels
13:21  lvh: fliebel: Onto what?

13:23  fliebel: lvh: Thanks :)
13:29  vokoda: someone recommend the best python book for someone with some programming experience looking to write server software - i don't mind if its online/hardcopy
13:29  shylent: maybe you should just start with twisted tutorials / krondoblog
13:29  Yhg1s: after docs.python.org/tut, probably.
13:30  mwizard: lvh: not embedded, but more memory hassle == less performance
13:30  shylent: oh, I've read it as 'some programming experience' with python
13:30  shylent: as in 'some python programming experience'
13:30  vokoda: nah javascript
13:30  vokoda: i'm using tornado at the moment
13:30  vokoda: i'm looking more for a general book
13:31  lvh: mwizard: That's a dangerous generalization when not backed up with measurements.
13:32  lvh: vokoda: Yeah, you want the krondoblog posts
13:32  lvh: vokoda: What sort of JS experience? node, or frontend web dev?
13:33  shylent: it would've been interesting to do twisted *after* node.js and not the other way round
13:33  vokoda: lvh: frontend stuff, really very simple
13:33  lvh: shylent: Why's that
13:34  mwizard: lvh: ok, isn't that obvious that managing N items of 1024 bytes per item is faster than managing N items of 4096 bytes per items by approx 4 times if algirithm is unchanged?
13:34  mwizard: *per item
13:34  lvh: vokoda: Yeah, then you want the krondoblog posts
13:34  lvh: mwizard: Not at all.
13:34  lvh: mwizard: Why would it be?
13:34  Yhg1s: mwizard: __slots__ aren't a simple memory savings.
13:34  Yhg1s: they also have downsides.
13:34  shylent: lvh: well, for me twisted is the first ever experience in event-based programming so naturally I compare everything to it and the other way round
13:35  mwizard: Yhg1s: if you are talking about restricting in object dynamics - i'm aware of that
13:35  Yhg1s: mwizard: no.
13:35  mwizard: what more?
13:35  Yhg1s: mwizard: I'm talking about Python having to do *much more work* to get an attribute that is a slot.
13:35  lvh: Caching is based on the premise that using more memory doesn't mean everything goes slower.
13:35  mwizard: hm
13:35  lvh: __slots__ is a fairly analogous reasoning: smaller != faster.
13:35  vokoda: isn't the krondo stuff a bit twisted-centric, i've heard some not so good things about twisted in a production environment
13:36  shylent: :O
13:36  mwizard: i'm starting to remember that __slots__ is implemented by spawning descriptors for each mentioned field...
13:36  lvh: vokoda: Like what?
13:36  shylent: what kind of things?
13:36  lvh: vokoda: Also, let me guess: you heard it from the Tornado people? :-)
13:36  vokoda: twisted.web is supposed to be really confusing
13:36  vokoda: lvh: probably :P
13:37  ruxpin: I have a weird problem with py26. I fork at some point in the code and thus have 2 processes. I need to shutdown it properly with both "kill -15" and ctrl-c at the console, and I bind the SIGTERM to a method in the __init__ of a daemon class called from __main__. Forking is done in another class. However, ctrl-c is sent to the child process and "kill -15 <main pid>" does not do anything but "kill -15 <child pid>" works as expected
13:37  lvh: vokoda: Person X thinks software Y they do not understand is more confusing than software Z they wrote themselves -- news at 11
13:37  lvh: vokoda: You can use all of Tornado's HTTP bits on Twisted, this is called Cyclone.
13:37  ruxpin: everything should be killed from the main process, so I was wondering if I have a problem in my code or is this a bug/feature in py26?
13:38  Yhg1s: ruxpin: which process gets ^C delivered when you have multiple processes attached to the terminal is tricky. You can usually not really know.
13:38  ruxpin: Yhg1s: it is always the child process. the problem is that I may have more than 1 child process
13:38  Yhg1s: ruxpin: SIGTERM delivered to a specific process should work, though, if the process isn't blocking the signal.
13:38  lvh: vokoda: In return, you get a non-terrible, portable, tested event loop that isn't written by people who don't understand ENODATA, EINTR and EAGAIN, does async DNS and SSL (and not faking it through stunnel), and supports external reactors.
13:38  eggy_: ^C is send to all the processes in the foreground process group
13:38  lvh: vokoda: Oh, and a *massive* amount of existing code that has nothing to do with web dev.
13:39  ruxpin: eggy_: can I put the child process into the background with python? btw, I am using Thread
13:39  eggy_: (which is the process started by the shell and any of its children that do not detach or form a new process group)
13:39  ruxpin: my processes are threading too
13:39  Yhg1s: ruxpin: oh, well, then.
13:39  lvh: s/external/third-party/, eg glib, qt,...
13:39  Yhg1s: ruxpin: threads and signals don't mix.
13:39  ruxpin: Yhg1s: oh :o
13:39  lvh: ruxpin: On POSIX, threads + signals == undefined behavior.
13:39  eggy_: ruxpin: yes, you make it a daemon: you do this by forking twice and calling os.setsid
13:39  lvh: Which usually means "broken".
13:40  mwizard: threads + forks == even more chaos
13:40  ruxpin: it works like it should, except shutdown is handled by killing "wrong" pid
13:40  eggy_: The behaviour is not undefined, it's just that you don't know to which thread a signal is delivered (unless you use signal masks (which python doesn't))
13:40  Yhg1s: eggy_: it's undefined by POSIX. different platforms implement different behaviour.
13:40  lvh: Well, I guess it would be okay in a language where 'thread' doesn't actually mean 'thread'
13:40  lvh: eggy_: Under POSIX, it most definitely is.
13:41  lvh: eggy_: (undefined)
13:41  ruxpin: well, it behaves the same on OSX and linux
13:41  Yhg1s: and some platforms don't document any specific behaviour.
13:41  lvh: ruxpin: Occasionally!
13:41  vokoda: lvh: you've convinced me to take another look. i think i was partly put off by the invented terminology, 'the reactor' seems to be a pretentious label for something pretty standard, the documentation seemed over complicated. both of those points are superficial i suppose
13:41  ruxpin: fortunately I don't use signals for anything else than terminating, but this is good to know
13:41  Yhg1s: ruxpin: does the main process also use threads?
13:42  lvh: vokoda: Twisted did not invent the term Reactor
13:42  eggy_: Yhg1s: lvh what about pthread_sigmask?
13:42  lvh: vokoda: Reactor is a standard term for a pattern, and is defined in the GOF book.
13:42  ruxpin: Yhg1s: main proc does not thread but the children do
13:43  lvh: vokoda: "event loop" would have been a more or less equivalent term for all existing implementations, but I don't see why you would mandate that
13:43  shylent: vokoda: IMO, once you start solving (or trying to solve) real problems with twisted, it all starts making sense
13:43  Yhg1s: ruxpin: then sending SIGTERM to the main process should still work
13:43  lvh: vokoda: People often say bad things about the docs, but I haven't received any real, clear definitions of problems
13:43  shylent: 3
13:43  lvh: vokoda: It would be nice if we knew what you thought sucked about said docs. Because then we could fix it.
13:44  Yhg1s: eggy_: I don't remember. threads and processes are such a mess that I tend to forget all the details as soon as I figure them out again.
13:44  lvh: vokoda: If you are looking for an introduction to async programming, the twisted docs aren't it, the krondoblog posts are.
13:44  vokoda: shylent lvh: i'm going to give it try, this krondoblog stuff looks very good
13:44  vokoda: lvh: thanks
13:45  eggy_: Yhg1s: signals and processes (and process groups) are pretty well defined. About the threads, I'm not so sure it's undefined. I think you just cannot know to which thread a signal is delivered unless you take measures
13:47  lvh: eggy_: This makes my brain hurt. I remember there are at least two gotchas with sigmask
13:47  wagnerflo: on python 2.5/2.6 pressing Ctrl-C during the prompt of the getpass.getpass function doesn't raise a KeyboardInterrupt... anything I can do to make it raise one?
13:47  lvh: eggy_: But at first glance sigmasking all but one of your threads to not accept any signals ought to work.
13:47  Yhg1s: wagnerflo: on which platform?
13:47  eggy_: lvh: yes, exactly
13:48  eggy_: lvh: some programs dedicate one thread to signal handling and have the full set of signals masked in others
13:48  lvh: eggy_: If you want I can mail my ex colleague at the asylum
13:48  eggy_: lvh: of course, unblockable signals are still delivered to any thread
13:48  wagnerflo: Yhg1s: linux
13:48  ruxpin: Yhg1s, lvh, eggy_ : thanks, I'll check out setsid. I had problems earlier with wrong threads getting the signal, but I think I fixed it already
13:49  eggy_: lvh: sure, if he can tell about the problems, I'll be glad to hear them
13:49  eggy_: ruxpin: look at the deamon recipe from activestate
13:49  lvh: also, twistd
13:49  Yhg1s: wagnerflo: then the only thing you can do is not use getpass.getpass(). It explicitly disables ^C (and ^\ and ^Z)
13:49  ruxpin: at least I know now I'm approaching the valley of dragons
13:49  eggy_: ruxpin: this one: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/278731-creating-a-daemon-the-python-way/
13:50  eggy_: There's also start-stop-daemon. And there is twistd
13:50  ruxpin: exactly, I have a daemon that should control 1+ child procs
13:50  lvh: ruxpin: That's okay, just create a twisted.application.service.Application and then use twistd on it
13:50  Yhg1s: wagnerflo: if you really want this you could copy the code from getpass.getpass and remove the clearing of termios.ISIG.
13:50  lvh: ruxpin: Interesting, I'm writing practically the same thing
13:50  lvh: ruxpin: Except I'm limiting it to *one* child process. Why does yours do many?
13:51  ruxpin: lvh: currently in production it only has one child, but originally it was meant to handle 2
13:51  ruxpin: lvh: the processes are services
13:51  wagnerflo: Yhg1s: I see... ah... actually it raises one in python 2.5 but not in 2.6...
13:52  Yhg1s: wagnerflo: yep, looks like it changed in 2.6.
13:52  ruxpin: lvh: each process has a client thread and server thread that operate between backend and a public api
13:53  lvh: ruxpin: Okay, but I still don't see why
13:53  lvh: ruxpin: Or what the client thread does or what the server thread does
13:54  ruxpin: lvh: client listens to messages from backend and does an rpc request and returns the response to backend
13:55  lvh: ruxpin: Great! all of that sounds like socket IO
13:55  ruxpin: lvh: server listens for rpc requests, sends the message to backend and returns possible response to rpc
13:55  hetii: Hello
13:55  ruxpin: lvh: so I was thinking that handling them in different threads was reasonable
13:55  lvh: ruxpin: Yeah, I strongly disagree with that
13:55  hetii: please check that:
13:56  hetii: http://pastebin.ca/1974595
13:56  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282175/ (repasted for hetii)
13:56  ruxpin: lvh: and the daemon will start out the rpc server/client proc, and I had code for soap server/client too
13:56  hetii: why i got invalid token ?
13:56  Yhg1s: hetii: remove the leading zeroes.
13:56  Yhg1s: hetii: a number with a leading zero (and not '0x') is an octal number. base-8. it can't contain 8 or 9, and it's not the number you want it to be.
13:57  hetii: but why ? on the first example i dont need to remove it
13:57  Yhg1s: on the first example the result isn't actually the number you want. Print it out and you'll see.
14:00  mapreduce: Is there anything like an inline if or C's ?: operator?
14:00  bob2: foo if cond else bar
14:00  bob2: consider if a nromal if statement is clearer tho
14:02  mapreduce: I have "None" if parameter == None else str(parameter)
14:02  mapreduce: Is there a better way of writing that?
14:02  Yhg1s: mapreduce: str(parameter) would do the exact same thing.
14:02  mapreduce: str(parameter) complained about None.
14:02  Yhg1s: then you replaced str() with something else.
14:02  jorrit: mapreduce, str(None) returns "None"
14:02  Yhg1s: >>> str(None)
14:02  mapreduce: Ok, standalone that works, I'll try again.
14:02  Yhg1s: 'None'
14:02  tasslehoff: after upgrading python from 2.6 to 2.7 on my Ubuntu, is there a way I can get all the packages I installed in 2.6 to be known in 2.7?
14:03  bob2: tasslehoff: installing them again
14:03  Yhg1s: tasslehoff: install them for 2.7.
14:03  bob2: if you mean 'i installed 2.7 using the ubuntu packages', that is alreay done
14:03  mapreduce: It seems I made a different mistake then, thanks.
14:03  tpratt: i love nested conditional expressions so much
14:04  bob2: clarity is for suckas
14:04  eto: hello
14:04  mapreduce: I like nesting.
14:04  tasslehoff: bob2: ah. actually a colleague that installed from source, but I told him about the packages now :)
14:04  eto: is there some xml-vtd for python?
14:05  kn100: Is there a recommended way to use ffmpeg with python?
14:07  kn100: I know i could probably just use os.popen('ffmpeg..whatever')
14:07  kn100: but is there a more elegant way of doing it ?
14:07  tpratt: kn100: subprocess module
14:08  tr3x: i don't think that's what he was asking..
14:08  kn100: yeah subprocess will garner similar results, but that's not the question
14:08  hemanth: how to check to split() was successful ? len(string.split(":")) > 1 is it?
14:08  kn100: I'm wondering if there's some library
14:08  kn100: or something that doesn't rely on opening a process in that way
14:09  tpratt: rather than os.popen, otherwise google to see if there are python bindings
14:09  kn100: hmnn http://code.google.com/p/wffmpeg/
14:09  kn100: looks interesting
14:10  farciarz84: could someone give me a good reason/example why I shouldn't do type checking but go EAFP try/except?
14:12  bob2: farciarz84: because it is pointless extra effort
14:12  bob2: hemanth: I guess that's ok, but with more context there might be a simpler way
14:14  hemanth: bob2, me too looking out for better ways
14:14  Yhg1s: farciarz84: because passing different types that behave the same way is common practice, and your pointless extra work would break those uses.
14:17  Yhg1s: farciarz84: of course, just trying something and catching the exception is usually also not the way to go. Just *using* the object and *not* catching the exception is.
14:18  dbu_: what is a platform-independent way to get an empty port?
14:19  farciarz84: Yhg1s: and then you got a crashed app without any notice?
14:19  jpic: hi all, is it possible for the logging module to use micro seconds?
14:19  Yhg1s: farciarz84: no, you get a very clear report about which type wasn't what it was supposed tobe, and which function passed it where.
14:20  Yhg1s: dbu_: bind it to ('', 0)
14:20  Yhg1s: (or a specific address, as long as the port is 0.)
14:20  dbu_: Yhg1s: does that work in windows?
14:20  Yhg1s: dbu_: after that you can call the getsockname method to get the port it bound to.
14:20  Yhg1s: it should, yes.
14:20  dbu_: ok, thanks! :)
14:22  farciarz84: Yhg1s: can't imagine your way i.e. web form validation when the exception should be catched and adeqate message display for user
14:22  Yhg1s: farciarz84: you seem to think an object's *type* should vary based on input. It most assuredly should not.
14:22  Yhg1s: farciarz84: an object's type is part of program logic. an object's *value* can vary based on input, though.
14:23  Yhg1s: forms, for example, contain bytes. Taking input and turning it into, say, an integer is something quite different from what you described, and using try/except there is fine.
14:23  Yhg1s: but a typecheck wouldn't help you with that, anyway.
14:24  farciarz84: sure I'd go try/except
14:25  eMyller: Why should i never use relative imports? I can't find any reference about shy it's evil.
14:25  Yhg1s: eMyller: they have no value over absolute imports, and they work in a few cases less.
14:26  Yhg1s: there is a usecase for explicit relative imports, but it's rather rare. Implicit relative imports should be avoided because it isn't clear which module you intended to import.
14:27  eMyller: okay, thanks.
14:30  neumaennl: EyePulp: reading your nickname produces quite undelightful images in my brain :P
14:31  EyePulp: Aww, it's warm and fuzzy - it'll grow on you. =)
14:35  Insayne: how can i again get only the first 5 letters from a string?
14:36  Yhg1s: Insayne: s[:5]
14:36  EyePulp: Insayne:   foo = some_string[:5]
14:36  EyePulp: too slow =(
14:38  Insayne: ah, right, sorry :P
14:38  Insayne: thanks!
14:48  xro: hi. i need a advice about python and ocr... i get 6 string that form some chars and i have to recognize it --> http://dpaste.com/265029/... heave you an idea about how to do it?
14:50  Wild_Cat: xro: are the character shapes unique?
14:50  Wild_Cat: that is, is each capital T always going to look the same?
14:50  xro: <Wild_Cat>, yes all letters will be always the same. But i could get 6 letters a-z A-Z 0-9...
14:51  Taos: Morning all
14:51  Wild_Cat: xro: if that's the case, you can try to split the strings into individual letter shapes (look for columns of whitespace), and the bruteforce the shapes.
14:52  simplechat: hey guys, basically i've got a smallish problem with python. I've got a series of gaps that i need to insterspace in a list, and i need all the ways that those gaps could be placed within this list
14:52  dbu_: xro: make a parser that reads left to right, and can split on columns, then you'll be well on your way
14:52  xro: <Wild_Cat>, seems to be complicate... no simpler way?
14:53  Wild_Cat: xro: it's not complicated. Once you have each individual letter, which is very easy, compare it to each of the known letter shapes you have stored somewhere in your program.
14:54  xro: <Wild_Cat>, i thougth about save in a pnj file then run an OCR.... So i have to creat all the letter by myself....
14:54  Wild_Cat: xro: PNG -> OCR is far more complicated if you ask me.
14:57  Kylarr: simplechat would you mind giving an example?
15:01  simplechat: Kylarr, say i have one gap and [1,2] then it could be [Gap, 1, 2], [1, gap, 2] and [1,2, gap]
15:01  Kylarr: What about two gaps with [1, 2]?
15:02  simplechat: [Gap, gap, 1, 2], [Gap, 1, gap, 2], ....
15:02  simplechat: etc
15:02  Kylarr: Okay I see.
15:02  Taos: I love sqlalchemy
15:02  simplechat: so i'm thinking something like itertools.permutation
15:03  flupke: what is the complexity of set.intersection ?
15:03  Yhg1s: flupke: O(n)
15:03  Yhg1s: well, with n of the first set. I don't think it picks the shortest set.
15:04  flupke: thanks Yhg1s (any reason why they say "?" on the wiki ?)
15:04  Yhg1s: oh, no, it does. So, O(n) where n is the size of the shortest set.
15:04  Yhg1s: no idea.
15:04  Yhg1s: (I don't know which wikipage you mean.)
15:04  flupke: this one: http://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
15:05  Yhg1s: I should say 'average-case O(n)'.
15:07 * babloo says GE to all
15:07  atxq: I am loping through a for statement and I want to update the variable name to end with name+i. how can I do this?
15:07  Yhg1s: atxq: you want to change a string a variable refers to, or change the variable itself?
15:08  Wild_Cat: atxq: "name = name + i" ?
15:08  atxq: change the variable itself
15:08  Yhg1s: atxq: you cannot.
15:08  babloo: friends  a  basic question wants a wise answer please how to start with python
15:08  babloo: ?
15:08  Yhg1s: variables are themselves not variable. Use a list instead.
15:08  Yhg1s: babloo: read a tutorial.
15:08  Wild_Cat: atxq: alternately, "name += i"?
15:08  Yhg1s: babloo: which tutorial to read depends on personal preference and prior knowledge.
15:09  babloo: Yhg1s: I know C and a little bit of c++ and want to go with security domain
15:09  Trashlord: heh
15:10  Trashlord: If you truly knew another programming language, you wouldn't even need to ask that question
15:10  Yhg1s: babloo: I'm not sure what 'security domain' means. docs.python.org/tut may be the tutorial you want.
15:10  atxq: for i in range(5): name+i How can I end up with name0,name1,name2,name3,name4?
15:10  mapreduce: I have def Send(self, other stuff): \n def Actual(e): some code here \n return Actual
15:11  mapreduce: Is there a better way of writing that?  E.g., in Scala I'd write def Send(self, other stuff)(e) and calling Send(self, other stuff) would return a function that takes e.
15:11  Trashlord: atxq: wild guess would be variable_for_name + i
15:12  aboudreault: hi, is overloading a function supported in a class?
15:12  Isvara: aboudreault: What would you even overload it on?
15:13  atxq: so no easy way to get name0,name1,name2,name3,name4,etc.?
15:13  bahamas: atxq: use a dictionary instead
15:13  aboudreault: Isvara, number or parameter type.
15:13  aboudreault: of*
15:13  Isvara: aboudreault: Parameters don't have types in Python
15:13  Yhg1s: atxq: you cannot.
15:13  Yhg1s: atxq: use a list instead.
15:13  aboudreault: they have... using cython :/
15:13  atxq: a dictionary? trying to avoid to have to define each variable before the loop
15:14  Yhg1s: aboudreault: no, it isn't.
15:14  aboudreault: cython: this is my first function: def Merge(self, double x, double y), and the other one: def Merge(self, OGREnvelope other):
15:14  aboudreault: wonder how I should do that.
15:15  aboudreault: well.. I suppose it's not the right place to ask.
15:15  Yhg1s: aboudreault: the usual way you do it in Python: have two different methods.
15:15  aboudreault: Yhg1s, kk
15:15  atxq: I need to create a unique name to reference the object afterwards. so I should create an empty dict/list first, then append each item
15:17  Yhg1s: atxq: you can't *have* different variables for each iteration through the loop. Variables are part of your program logic, not your data. If you want to keep references to the objects in the loop around, use a container, like a list or a dict.
15:17  Yhg1s: you only need one container for all the objects.
15:17  atxq: so I would need two loops to be able to use the data; one to append the dict, the other to return the data? is there another easier way?
15:17  Yhg1s: atxq: I'm not sure why you think you need a loop to return the data.
15:17  Yhg1s: just return the container.
15:17  Yhg1s: (you can only return one thing, anyway.)
15:18  Insayne: hrm, this is odd: I got a string that is iso-8859-1, i decode it as such - however, i wish to convert it to UTF-8, how would I go about doing that? I tried: string.decode('iso-8859-1').encode('UTF-8') however that doesnt seem to work?
15:18  Yhg1s: Insayne: what doesn't work about it?
15:18  Yhg1s: because that's how you do it.
15:18  atxq: using for  wx.ListCtrl,wx.Menu,wx.Toolbar
15:18  Insayne: at least, when i try to insert it into an SQL db, i get this: ProgrammingError: You must not use 8-bit bytestrings unless you use a text_factory that can interpret 8-bit bytestrings (like text_factory = str). It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings.
15:18  Insayne: and i wonder, wtf are 8-bit bytestrings
15:19  Yhg1s: Insayne: unicode isn't UTF-8. Your DB-API module is telling you to use unicode instead of UTF-8 bytestrings.
15:19  Insayne: oh
15:19  Yhg1s: Insayne: bytestrings are 'str'. unicode is 'unicode'. str.decode() gives you unicode. unicode.encode() gives you bytestrings.
15:19  Insayne: aha, im confused
15:19  Insayne: lol
15:19  Insayne: so that means i need to convert it to unicode first?
15:20  Juhaz: you already have (the decode part), but then spoil it and convert it back from unicode to bytestring
15:20  Juhaz: +you
15:20  Insayne: oh
15:20  Yhg1s: Insayne: just don't encode it back into UTF-8.
15:20  Insayne: well, thats what I have issues with though - the sorting is messed up in SQL due to it
15:21  Insayne: and i thought by going unicode/UTF-8, it would fix it
15:21  Yhg1s: Insayne: unicode and UTF-8 are two entirely different things.
15:21  Insayne: ah, I thought it was the same
15:21  Yhg1s: yes, unfortunately too many people think so.
15:21  Insayne: well, how could i get the iso-8859-1 into unicode?
15:22  Yhg1s: you already have it.
15:22  Insayne: .encode("unicode") ?
15:22  Insayne: oh
15:22  Yhg1s: no.
15:22  Yhg1s: 's.decode()' gives you unicode.
15:22  Insayne: ah alright
15:22  Yhg1s: we already mentioned this a couple fo times. Just omit the encoding.
15:22  Insayne: yes, but when I do that - my issue that SQL can't sort properly remains
15:23  shylent: what sql db? mysql?
15:23  Yhg1s: then unicode won't solve the issue.
15:23  shylent: maybe you have your collations messed up?
15:23  Insayne: sqlite3 in python
15:23  Yhg1s: how are you sorting what, what order are you expecting and what order are you getting?
15:23  Insayne: my collation is "TEXT"
15:23  Insayne: SELECT * FROM siddb ORDER BY title DESC LIMIT 5000
15:24  Insayne: im expecing special chars , then numbers, then alphabet a-z
15:24  Insayne: from it
15:24  Insayne: i get them mixed up
15:24  Yhg1s: well, then your expectations are wrong.
15:24  Insayne: ah
15:24  Yhg1s: unicode defines how characters are sorted, and that's not how.
15:25  Insayne: alright
15:25  Insayne: sooo, how would I change it to work as I said?
15:25  shylent: hmm, what do you mean, 'TEXT' collation? afaik, sqlite only has binary collation by default
15:25  Yhg1s: Insayne: define your own ordering scheme.
15:26  Insayne: hrm, i will soon just make a tuple out of it
15:26  Insayne: heh
15:26  Insayne: sort(mytuple) prolly will do it right
15:26  Insayne: :(
15:26  Yhg1s: if the tuple contains unicode, Python will also sort them according to the unicode rules.
15:26  Yhg1s: usually, anyway.
15:26  Insayne: oh my
15:26  Insayne: can i convert unicode into something else, to get the ordering i described?
15:27  Yhg1s: You could encode it back into iso-8859-1, if that orders the way you want.
15:27  Insayne: well, im gonna verify SQL is screwing up now to be 100% sure
15:27  Insayne: :)
15:28 --- MrElendig is now known as Mion
15:29  Juhaz: you define "special characters" as anything that isn't 0-9a-Z?
15:31  atxq: is there a way to loop through a list, then generate a variable with the value of the list item? ex. item = List[i]
15:31  Insayne: Juhaz, yes
15:32  Insayne: hrm, looking at this, i cant even print to console anymore when it has special chars
15:32  Juhaz: I'd be pretty pissed if I cared about sorting and a database thought the last letter in Finnish alphabet (ö) goes before a.
15:32  sig^: because some people still haven't got UTF-8  /:
15:32 --- AaronMT_ is now known as AaronMT
15:32  Insayne: Juhaz, thats exactly what happens for me
15:32  Insayne: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xda' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
15:33  Insayne: how do I get rid of that?
15:33  Insayne: ah, nvm, encoded to UTF8, it works :P
15:34  Kylarr: simplechat is this what you want? http://bpaste.net/show/10398/
15:34  atxq: so I want to create a valiable for each list item and assign the item value to the vaiable created
15:34  atxq: possible?
15:34  simplechat: thanks Kylarr :)
15:35  Insayne: why can I not store UTF-8 into an SQL database?
15:35  simplechat: Kylarr, why is there redundancy in the output?
15:35  Kylarr: Where?
15:35  Juhaz: Insayne, because text column is supposed to represent characters, not bytes
15:37  Insayne: i see
15:37  Insayne: well, let me show you the sorting i get

15:37  thyko: Insayne: blob
15:37  Insayne: look, this is what I get from: SELECT * FROM siddb ORDER BY title DESC
15:38  bahamas: atxq: what's wrong with simply using the list and accessing items from it when you need them?
15:38  Insayne: (i capture when the first letter of the title is different from the previous one, and then display it)
15:39  atxq: because the list items need to be references in the loop as unique ids to create objects
15:40  Insayne: anyone got an idea about my sorting issue?
15:41  atxq: bahamas: you understand my situation now?
15:41  Blacklance34: good morning
15:42  Blacklance34: Is there a format in which I have to follow when asking a question here in #python? minus don't be a idiot and beg for help?
15:42  Insayne: Blacklance34, yes - attach donations
15:42  Insayne: :P
15:42  Blacklance34: haha
15:43  teratorn: Blacklance34: paste CC info
15:43  atxq: I want to create a series of objects based on the length of a list, and I want to do it using a for loop to simplify my code
15:43  Blacklance34: I wish I was made of money my friend, unfortunately students don't get squat lol
15:43  xro: hi, what should i use to read an keybord entry from the console... I mean execute some code then ask something, the user answer with the keyboard then continue the code.... (like scanf in C)
15:44  thyko: xro: raw_input()
15:44  Blacklance34: CC info? sorry I am a little new so please explain CC?
15:44  atxq: this requires unique ids for each list item, so I want to increment a variable then use it as a unique id to create the object
15:44  xro: thyko>, thanks
15:44  teratorn: Blacklance34: credit card
15:45  teratorn: don't forget the little number on the back
15:45  Kylarr: atxq, what about making a list and then appending to it on each iteration?
15:45  Blacklance34: haha. at least python programmers have a sense of humour. I asked for help related to doing chroot jails in #ubuntu oh boy.
15:45  Blacklance34: that was a mistake.
15:46  atxq: i am going to try using two lists, but not sure if that would work either. was hoping that python has a simple way of doing this
15:46  teratorn: atxq: why do you need two lists?
15:46  smbitsh: BLacklance: Your first mistake is that you are using ubuntu
15:46  smbitsh: Switch to slackware.
15:46  Blacklance34: :O?
15:46  smbitsh: Quickly.
15:46  Juhaz: Insayne, got to admit I don't quite understand the reasoning for the position of the generic currency symbol, but the letters seem to be ordered just right.
15:46  thyko: smbitsh: slack youuuu meeeen
15:46  Blacklance34: ehh... just following the program requirements smbitsh
15:46  smbitsh: slack!
15:47  smbitsh: Oh boy....
15:47  thyko: smbitsh: it really iiis the sh*t
15:47  atxq: one to hold my object data and the other to hold the unique variable to create the object in my loop statement
15:47  smbitsh: No further comment.
15:47  Blacklance34: haha.
15:47  smbitsh: Indeedy it is thyko
15:47  smbitsh: ubuntu blows chunks
15:47  Blacklance34: anyways let me get started on my question here
15:47  pr100: maybe when we're done with distro wars we could move onto editor wars? :)
15:47  smbitsh: You will learn *alot* more about GNU/Linux with slackware than you can ever hope to with crapbuntu
15:47  smbitsh: And everything *works* the way it should.
15:48  Isvara: smbitsh: This isn't the place for distro wars.
15:48  Kylarr: atxq, maybe you want a dict that maps the unique ID to the object.
15:48  Isvara: Everyone has their preference.
15:48  smbitsh: Youre right Isv
15:48  bahamas: atxq: the alternative would be your_dict['name%d' % id] = object in a loop
15:48  shylent: smbitsh: well, doesn't beat windows 7 anyway
15:48  smbitsh: I was just trying to save Blacklance from a lot of grief.
15:49  Blacklance34: I believe you smbitsh, but one step at a time. I am very new to linux in general and I just need to get through the semester first! haha
15:49  Blacklance34: ok so I pasted my code to the fpaste link as asked
15:49  teratorn: you really shouldn't believe him
15:49  Blacklance34: now, I am having a few issues with my code
15:49  Blacklance34: what it is suppose to do
15:49  atxq: one dict can be equivilant to two lists
15:50  smbitsh: My exprience with the slackware channel has been very good.  They seem to have a similar sense of humor like the python and django channels
15:50  atxq: your solution is more simplier
15:50  smbitsh: Ok, thats enough out of me.
15:50  bahamas: Blacklance34: you forgot to paste the link here
15:50  Blacklance34: http://fpaste.org/w2ks/
15:50  atxq: not sure if it would work in my case though; I am going to try it
15:51  Blacklance34: I apologize how messy my coding is, and it is all over the place.
15:51  atxq: thanks Kylarr, bahamas
15:51  Blacklance34: I have been trying to debug for about 3 or 4 days now
15:51  Blacklance34: to explain what it is suppose to do.
15:51  thyko: pr100: you're not going to start saying there is any other but vim are you?
15:51  Blacklance34: ./a1.py [source_ip] dest_ip filename
15:51  smbitsh: Blacklance, if you can get youtube on your machine you should watch Alex Martinelli's Painless python videos.
15:52  smbitsh: They are quite helpful.
15:52  smbitsh: I'm not trying to dissuade you from asking questions here though.
15:52  Blacklance34: I can get youtube running.
15:52  shylent: Blacklance34: so, whats the problem with it? crappy parsing? did you consider using IPy ?
15:52  Blacklance34: my problem is simply I had it working before
15:52  Blacklance34: it did what it was suppose to do
15:53 --- AaronMT_ is now known as AaronMT
15:53  smbitsh: When you have free time, he's quite good.
15:53  Blacklance34: but the professor wanted it in better formatting or I would not receive marks for it
15:53  shylent: Blacklance34: are you allowed to use external libraries? what you are doing is solved in, like, 2 method calls in IPy
15:54  Blacklance34: from another file?
15:54  Blacklance34: no
15:54  Blacklance34: just simply working with what I understand
15:54  Blacklance34: + my ip checkers regex is wrong
15:54  Blacklance34: it suppose to allow
15:54  shylent: can you also use OptionParser (or argparse) for option processing?
15:54  Blacklance34: 172 172.168 172.168.2
15:54  Blacklance34: etc etc
15:55  shylent: I can't make sense of your argument processing code :(
15:55  bahamas: Blacklance34: some general advice: imports go at the top (re, sys, os are modules not functions); keep your lines shorter; use 4 spaces for indentation
15:55  shylent: maybe its just the end of the day for me and I am being slow
15:55  Blacklance34: ok.
15:56  Blacklance34: again my apologies for this horribly written code
15:56  Blacklance34: this is my first year working with python and really any real scripting in general
15:56  bahamas: and i second shylent's question about using optparse. it's in the standard library
15:57  Blacklance34: if you would like bahamas, I can post the requirements of the assignment
15:57  Blacklance34: ok soo look into optparse?
15:57  shylent: yeah, please do :/
15:57  shylent: for your own sanity
15:59  elpargo: argparse will be even better it's an external dep and buildin 2.7_
15:59  elpargo: +
16:00  shylent: elpargo: well,  he said he cant use external libs so :/
16:00  Blacklance34: my assignment asks me to only use what has been taught within class
16:00 * shylent is very very glad, that such things are over for him
16:01  _twitch: anyone here from brazil?
16:01  Blacklance34: anything other then that would be considered plagiarism unless I can prove I understood python before hand, in my opinion his rules are stupid but he marks me.
16:01  Blacklance34: so I follow suit
16:01  bahamas: Blacklance34: tell the prof that he mentioned optparse in passing and that you looked it up and used it :)
16:01  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: I'm not sure it's really fair to ask for help here then :)
16:02 --- ysiadferreiras is now known as ysiad

16:02  Blacklance34: example
16:03  Blacklance34: your problem is in your ipcheck fix your regex
16:03  Blacklance34: I will comply, and figure it out on my own
16:04  michelem: hello folks
16:04  michelem: is there a way to append a "." to a string (to make a domain an FQDN) without a conditional?
16:04  Blacklance34: minus syntax and not understanding it
16:05  Blacklance34: I can only think that my problem is within my for loops where it checks the dictionary for each new occurrence of a destination ip and displays all connected source Ips
16:06  jorrit: michelem, s += '.'
16:06  Blacklance34: everything worked fine before I attempted to change the way output was displayed
16:07  michelem: jorrit: sorry, I meant add only if it's not there already
16:07  shylent: michelem: foo.rstrip('.') + '.'
16:07  michelem: coolya, thx
16:07  shylent: its obviously foo = ...
16:08  Blacklance34: so here is what the prof wants to see
16:08  pr100: but... that's just push the test into rstrip, not sure why that really is better

16:09  figure002: hello. i have an application which consists of multiple modules, and i need time's sleep() function in some modules. should i use 'import time' and use time.sleep() or is it better to do 'from time import sleep'?
16:09  Blacklance34: not a problem sorry about that
16:09  jorrit: figure002, I think that's a matter of taste.
16:09  nvictor: hey python
16:10  figure002: jorrit: ok, so there's no significant difference in performance?
16:10  pr100: figure002: doesn't really matter, but in big systems it's normally better to use the fully qualified names everywhere, makes it clear what you're using and avoids nameclashes
16:10  nvictor: anyone has ever implemented confidence interval using python?
16:10  jorrit: figure002, performance? What has that to do with this?
16:10  Blacklance34: so where within my code is the conflict?
16:10  banisterfiend: hi, if i have a python class that inherits from two classes, and both those classes define a 'hello' method, which method gets precedence?
16:10  lilalinux: http://pastebin.com/k0heGJC4
16:10  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282220/ (repasted for lilalinux)
16:10  lilalinux: can someone explain line 6 to me?
16:11  figure002: jorrit: by using 'import time' i somehow get the feeling that it's loading all methods from time, instead of just time, which might slow it down a little.
16:11  jorrit: lilalinux, it multiplies -1 with itself.
16:11  figure002: pr100: thanks for the explanation
16:11  Miff: hey there, how can i parallell loop over two objects with variable length iterator return values? doing for a,b in zip(c,d) cuts d short of one value if its return is a dict of 4 in length and c is 3 in length
16:11  lilalinux: jorrit: will it return a new object with all it's members multiplied by 1.0?
16:11  banisterfiend: can someone answer?
16:11  jorrit: lilalinux, depends on the rest of the class which you didn't paste.
16:12  Yhg1s: Miff: sounds like you want itertools.izip_longest instead.
16:12  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: the first one in the method resolution order.
16:12  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: which is approximately depth-first, left to right.
16:12  banisterfiend: Yhg1s: but what determines the mro
16:12  banisterfiend: ok
16:12  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: for new-style classes, the C3 algorithm determines the MRO.
16:12  Miff: Yhg1s: thanks
16:12  lilalinux: jorrit: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282221/
16:12  lilalinux: does that help?
16:13  jorrit: lilalinux, yes, it will basically call __mull__
16:13  lilalinux: oh, i see
16:13  banisterfiend: Yhg1s: but assuming im using new-style classes and inherit C1, and C2 into my class (and those classes dont have superclassse) then which method gets precedence?
16:14  lilalinux: it uses the overloaded function
16:14  lilalinux: jorrit: thank you

16:14  nvictor: ah come on infobob
16:14  banisterfiend: nvictor: excuse me? what kind of language is 'demonstrature'
16:14  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: in instances of that class, C1 takes precedence. In instances of subclasses, either could take precedence. You should read up on the C3 algorithm if you worry. Or, www.python.org/2.2.3/descrintro.html
16:14  nvictor: pastebin has improved
16:14  Vizard: hello all, how can I add a P3P header via Python-CGI ?
16:14  jorrit: nvictor, STILL has ads.
16:14  nvictor: banisterfiend: that was a joke
16:14  Yhg1s: Vizard: what is a 'P3P header'?
16:14  nvictor: jorrit: ok
16:15  banisterfiend: nvictor: :)
16:15  nvictor: banisterfiend: demo if you like
16:15  Vizard: Yhg1s, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P
16:16  banisterfiend: nvictor: so inheriting from (B, A)  is almost equivalent to inheriting from B which in turn inherits from A ?
16:16  nvictor: no not really
16:16  nvictor: dash: what was that secret method again to get mro resolution?
16:16  banisterfiend: nvictor: your example seems to indicate that
16:17  Matisse_: hi
16:17  Yhg1s: Vizard: well, do you want to include it in the HTTP header or the HTML head? (The latter is easier.)
16:17  nvictor: yes but you see that after inheriting from A, it did not print 'hello' but ' world!'
16:17  Matisse_: is there a command to get a filename out of a whole path+filename ?
16:17  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: for a class C, which inherits from (B, A), which in turn inherit just from object, the method resolution order will be the same as for a class C that inherits from B that inherits from A that inherits from object.
16:18  Vizard: Yhg1s, i dont know if IE would accept the easy method, i would like to add in the http header
16:18  kurol: Matisse_: basename
16:18  Yhg1s: Vizard: then you need to find out what the HTTP header is and how it should look, and then you can just emit it alongside Content-Type in your CGI program.
16:18  pr100: Matisse_: http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html
16:18  Matisse_: thx
16:18  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: however, for subclasses from C involving other subclasses of A or B this may not be the case.
16:19  nvictor: banisterfiend: got it
16:19  nvictor: banisterfiend: import inspect and try inspect.getmro(Class) and you will have the method resolution order
16:19  Yhg1s: banisterfiend: see the URL I gave you for a long explanation.
16:20  Vizard: Yhg1s, the header is like this "P3P" = 'CP="IDC DSP COR ADM .. etc"' can I make this like that? => print "P3P: bla bla"; print "Content-Type: text/html" ?
16:21  Yhg1s: Vizard: sure.
16:21  Vizard: ok thank you :)
16:25  nvictor: banisterfiend: all ok now? :)
16:27  Blacklance34: ok
16:28  Blacklance34: looks like I figured out what the main problem is
16:28  Blacklance34: well what could be
16:28  Blacklance34: it is either the way I set up my dictionaries or the defined functions at the beginning
16:29  smbitsh: Test
16:29  smbitsh: Heh,
16:29  Miff: how i return a copy of an object from within the source object?
16:29  Miff: just return self ?
16:30  Yhg1s: Miff: that would return the same object.
16:30  Blacklance34: smbitsh: I tested it, to see if it even enters the loop using a print statement, and it does not.
16:30  Yhg1s: if you want to return a copy, you have to make a copy.
16:30  Miff: thats what i thought
16:30  Blacklance34: I am not sure why
16:30  Miff: Yhg1s: how do i do that? with self.__class__.__name__ ?
16:31  Miff: and __repr__ ?
16:31  Yhg1s: Miff: the name doesn't seem relevant?
16:31  Yhg1s: Miff: what are you trying to copy?
16:31  smbitsh: Blacklance34: That channel test
16:31  smbitsh: Not for you specifically.  But I appreciate you thinking of me.
16:31  Miff: im doing arithmetic overloading, where i add one object to another, and the recieving object should create a new object where the values of both are added together
16:32  smbitsh: I was in ubunty  and I tried to send a message and it said 'cannot send message to channel'
16:32  Blacklance34: http://fpaste.org/r89I/
16:32  Blacklance34: so there are the changes I made
16:32  Yhg1s: Miff: so create a new object. The usual way to do that is to instantiate the class you want.
16:32  Blacklance34: I just removed all of the formatting and checking
16:32  Blacklance34: just to see if I could run the loop
16:32  Blacklance34: it gives the print statements but stops before the loop
16:33  Miff: Yhg1s: yes, thats what i want, but im not sure how to sawn a new instance without specifying the class name statically
16:33  Yhg1s: Miff: well, how do you know what class to instantiate?
16:34  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: which prints do you see?
16:34  Blacklance34: file: netdump
16:34  Blacklance34: that is it.
16:34  Blacklance34: which means it does not make it to the loop
16:34  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: no, it means the loop doesn't execute.
16:34  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: dest_list2 is empty. Go ahead and print it before the loop.
16:34  Blacklance34: ok
16:34  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: now add print statements to what *makes* dest_list2, to see what it does there.
16:35  Yhg1s: keep doing that until you see where it's doing something other than you expect it to do.
16:36  Blacklance34: oh wow, it isn't populating the list at all
16:36  Yhg1s: that is obvious, yes, otherwise it would have entered the body of the loop at least once.
16:40  Blacklance34: the question is why is the list not populating with the my arguements?
16:40  Blacklance34: is it because it does not know where to look?
16:40  Blacklance34: or is it because it doesn't know what to look for?
16:40  smbitsh: Blacklance34:  Question, what machine did you install ubuntu on?  Was it a personal machine?  Or one provided by your university?
16:41  Yhg1s: Blacklance34: I would suggest it's because you're passing an empty list as the 'filt_list' argument to filt_sorc, so line 59 is an empty loop. it never gets executed.
16:42  Blacklance34: smbitsh: its on a portable HD, that goes into a drive bay
16:42  smbitsh: I C.
16:43  bahamas: Blacklance34: you commented line 69 so dest_list is empty
16:44  Blacklance34: ...
16:44  Blacklance34: HERP
16:44  Blacklance34: I just facepalmed.
16:45  Blacklance34: how did I not see that
16:46  al_admeld: Blacklance34: heh
16:48  locojay: hi  i m trying to build jcc on (Darwin locojaymp.home 10.4.2 Darwin Kernel Version 10.4.2: Tue Jul 27 21:17:17 PDT 2010; root:xnu-1504.7.60~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64)    i get jni.h not found but the gcc command (gcc-4.2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -Os -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DENABLE_DTRACE -arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64 -dynamiclib -D_jcc_lib -DJCC_VER="2.6"

16:49  VladDrac: how's that related to python?
16:50  locojay: in order to build pylucene you first nedd jcc
16:52  al_admeld: locojay: download the java development kit, then try again
16:57  locojay: thnks
16:57  xro: hi, is it possible to modify a pnj image structure in python? i mean modify the pixel value...
17:00  jwhisnant: xro - assume you mean pn format, yes - you can use PIL to do that
17:01  xro: <jwhisnant> pn?  a PNG file...
17:02  jwhisnant: xro: sorry, typo, it supports png and a number of other file formats as well
17:02  xro: jwhisnant, ok thanks... i'll try it!
17:05  jwhisnant: xro: and you will probably want to use list(im.getdata()) ; where im = Image.open(infile) ...
17:06  Brend: What!
17:06  xro: <jwhisnant>, in fact i have to decrypt an image... i get 3 images... one with the data is encrypted with the 2 others... a visual vigenere encryption
17:06  Brend: You totally don't want to convert the whole image to a Python list of pixels.
17:06  Brend: There are methods to alter individual pixels, and for larger jobs there's a method to get a numpy array.

17:11  C_Kode: Hi, what is the proper way to compare items in two different dicts?  They can have the same key or item, just not both key and item
17:11  C_Kode: if dict1 in dict2 doesn't seem to work
17:13  Trashlord: dict1 == dict2?
17:13  C_Kode: Thats a lot of nasty looping heh.  But I suppose that is the only way to do it
17:14  takeshita_kenji: Hello everyone.  I'm having trouble with subprocess on Windows.
17:14  C_Kode: Actually, that didn't work.
17:14  Trashlord: or you just do something like
17:14  al_admeld: C_Kode: duh lol
17:14  Trashlord: for i,x in dict1,dict2
17:14  Trashlord: something of that sort
17:15  confluency: C_Kode: what exactly are you trying to do?
17:15  takeshita_kenji: For testing purposes, I need a cross-platform way to start a collection of Python processes (networking), then cause all of them to get KeyboardInterrupt signals.
17:15  C_Kode: confluency: I have two dicts.  I want to make sure that there are no matching key/values.  The values can be dupes and the keys can be dupes, but not key/value dupes
17:16  VladDrac: makes sets out of the items and check the intersection
17:16  takeshita_kenji: I tried using .terminate() on the Popen objects, but that doesn't work very well.  Instead of getting KeyboardInterrupt, they get an error (Errno 10054) saying that the existing connection was focibly closed.
17:16  tastefullvenom: an application i want to use needs oauth2 installed ... i downloaded it but do not know how to install it.  can someone give me a hand pls?
17:16  VladDrac: set(dict1.iteritems()) & set(dict2.iteritems()) basically
17:16  takeshita_kenji: It works just fine on Linux and Mac OS X as expected.  How do I get the launched processes to raise KeyboardInterrupt without manually doing so?
17:17  takeshita_kenji: This is just with the basic sockets layer.  No HTTP or anything.
17:18  pr100: VladDrac: if he justs want to test for duplicate keys don't we want set(d1) & set(d2)  ?
17:18  confluency: It's not just duplicate keys.
17:18  al_admeld: C_Kode: if a.items() == b.items() to check if key and value are the same in both
17:18  VladDrac: pr100, I understand he wants to test duplicate key,value pairs
17:18  pr100: ah yeah
17:18  confluency: C_Kode: why are you doing this?
17:18  C_Kode: al_admeld: Thats what I just started trying
17:19  al_admeld: C_Kode: are you checking for all items being the same, or individual pairs
17:19  VladDrac: that will fail for {'a':1, 'b':2} and {'a':2, 'b':2}
17:19  VladDrac: or I'm misunderstandig the problem
17:19  al_admeld: VladDrac: no it wont
17:19  C_Kode: confluency: It's a JBoss cluster restarting script.  You have master nodes and web nodes.  I don't want duplicates in both lists.  Masters must start first.  If you restart tehm as web, then they are no longer master nodes
17:20  C_Kode: al_admeld: pairs
17:20  takeshita_kenji: So is it possible to use something in subprocess to get another Python process to get a KeyboardInterrupt on Windows?
17:20  confluency: C_Kode: so what you actually want is to remove key:value pairs in the second list which are also in the first list?
17:20  al_admeld: C_Kode: https://gist.github.com/dda0c2be09a5e3e56a90
17:21  Brend: C_Kode,
17:21  Brend: >>> set({'foo': 'bar', 'one': 'ding'}.items()) & set({'one': 'bar', 'foo': 'bar'}.items())
17:21  Brend: set([('foo', 'bar')])
17:21  C_Kode: confluency: Exactly
17:21  VladDrac: brend: that's what I said :)
17:21  Brend: Oh!
17:21  Brend: I didn't read back ;)
17:22  simplechat: hey guys, is there any nice way to deduplicate lists of lists
17:22  simplechat: ?
17:22  C_Kode: It's basically error checking so whoever creates the config file doesn't screw up the cluster
17:22  al_admeld: C_Kode: see the paste
17:22  smbitsh: Wait.
17:22  smbitsh: That didnt come out right.
17:22  C_Kode: al_admeld: looking
17:22  takeshita_kenji: simplechat: Do you want copy.copy or copy.deepcopy?
17:22  smbitsh: Anyway, I have a stupid question.
17:23  smbitsh: Is return the only method that can be used to return a value from a method or class?
17:23  simplechat: takeshita_kenji, nah, i'm producing a bunch of psudoarrays and need to dedupicate them
17:23  simplechat: the current array classes don't support the operations i need
17:23  takeshita_kenji: Oh, deduplicate.
17:23  simplechat: yeah
17:23  takeshita_kenji: Use sets?
17:23  al_admeld: smbitsh: yes
17:24  simplechat: throws
17:24  simplechat: TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
17:24  smbitsh: Good enough.  Thank you.
17:24  VladDrac: C_Kode, do my/brend suggestion work for you?
17:24  VladDrac: it's more fun not being ignored while helping, ususally
17:24  al_admeld: VladDrac: youre asking for a bit much ;)
17:24  takeshita_kenji: Try turning the list into a tuple first.
17:25  takeshita_kenji: The sublists too.
17:25  simplechat: how would i do that?
17:25  takeshita_kenji: tuple([1, 2, 3, 4]) => (1, 2, 3, 4)
17:25  simplechat: kk
17:25  simplechat: any nice way to do that recursively?
17:26  simplechat: becuase i can't use tuples
17:26  simplechat: i need to be adding rows/cols to it
17:26  erb: which editor / IDE would you prefer on a netbook? I would use netbeans, but I am afraid it would eat my atom processor and 1GB ram
17:26  al_admeld: erb: try aptana
17:26  takeshita_kenji: So what are the duplicates?
17:26  nvictor: erb: why use an IDE?
17:26  confluency: erb: do you have a current favourite editor?
17:27  takeshita_kenji: Is it a tree of varying depth?
17:27  takeshita_kenji: Or is it a list of lists?
17:28  al_admeld: simplechat: what exactly are you trying to accomplish
17:28  erb: confluency, if I have to pick one, its gedit, but i would prefer an IDE with auto-completion, like netbeans
17:28  simplechat: al_admeld, i'm trying to implement a DP 2d sequence alignment algorithm
17:28  al_admeld: erb: http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors
17:29  al_admeld: simplechat: english sir
17:29  simplechat: al_admeld, basically i'm having to add columns and rows into arrays many many times
17:30  takeshita_kenji: Why is Windows such a headache?
17:30  simplechat: and add gaps into arrays
17:30  simplechat: its just plain nasty
17:30  simplechat: :(
17:30  al_admeld: simplechat: youre using numpy?
17:30  smbitsh: simplechat: you cant use a dictionary?
17:30  smbitsh: Or did someone ask that already
17:31  erb: nvictor, why not use an IDE if you have a chance?
17:31  nvictor: erb: well sounds like you don't have a chance do you?
17:31  nvictor: netbooks are low on resource
17:31  smbitsh: 'unhashable list' sounds like youre trying to use a dictionary.
17:31  smbitsh: If I'm not mistaken.
17:31  al_admeld: simplechat: in summary, dict(your_array) or use numpy
17:32  warz: hi all. with a list, there's the "if 1 in [1,2,3]" syntax, but is there a way to check if a property value exists in a list of dictionaries? like is there a pythonic way for checking to see if [{'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}, {'foo': 3, 'bar': 4}] contains a dictionary where 'foo' == 1 ?
17:32  simplechat: al_admeld, had a look at numpy and i couldn't easily add columns/rows to arrays
17:32  simplechat: and you can't use a dictionary in this way, iirc
17:32  nvictor: erb: and honestly IDEs are made for big screens...
17:32  al_admeld: warz: dict.items() for k, v.  dict.keys() or dict.values()
17:33  al_admeld: warz: for x in dict.keys(): if x in some_thing_else:
17:33  warz: ah nice, ok
17:33  al_admeld: warz: also, help(dict)
17:33  takeshita_kenji: Still not liking Windows.
17:33  pr100: what's wrong with ed? :)
17:34  takeshita_kenji: .terminate() doesn't raise KeyboardError and there's no fork().
17:34  takeshita_kenji: Argh.
17:35  al_admeld: takeshita_kenji: use the signal module
17:35  guibou: in python-opengl, did anyone tried (and success) to use an offset != 0 in glVertexAttribPointer ? with VBOs ? I have an exception.
17:38  takeshita_kenji: al_admeld: According to the documentation, .send_signal(SIGTERM) just calls .terminate() in subprocess.
17:39  al_admeld: ok takeshita_kenji, https://gist.github.com/40f5ddfe33fe29cd0702 try that
17:42  eoss: Can anyone here give me advice on how to parse this. http://fpaste.org/WNPe/
17:42  eoss: I would like to get rid of the numbers in the beginning and split the news article from the author
17:43  eoss: should i use regex or are common methods good enough for this jo
17:43  eoss: job
17:43  tastefullvenom: can someone help me install oauth2 pls
17:43  eoss: if i need regex i will need to learn regex
17:44  Yhg1s: eoss: looks like 'number, rest = s.(None, 1); source, article = s.split('-', 1)'
17:44  pr100: depends on how much you know about the general form of the entries... from the look of it the number come before a '.' and the author/articles split can be done on the first '-'
17:45  Yhg1s: eoss: eh, 's.split(None, 1)' instead of 's.(None, 1)'
17:45  Yhg1s: and you may want to use ' - ' instead of '-' for the second split.
17:46  eoss: ok thank you
17:49  tastefullvenom: am i in the wrong room to ask for help?
17:50  dash: ask :)
17:50  tastefullvenom: Dash: thanks
17:50  reeniginEesreveR: i wanna use python to stream a video from one machine over network to another and display over there ... whats the easiest solution?
17:50  tastefullvenom: dash: i need to get and install oauth2
17:50  dash: reeniginEesreveR: probably flumotion
17:51  Yhg1s: tastefullvenom: so what's the question?
17:51  reeniginEesreveR: dash, gstreamer?
17:51  tastefullvenom: dash:  is there an official place where to get oauth?
17:51  dash: reeniginEesreveR: it uses gstreamer, yes
17:51  fliebel: How can I extend a generator? I need them to support + - * and /
17:51  pr100: tastefullvenom: google it?
17:51  Yhg1s: tastefullvenom: the python oauth2 module, or just anything that implements the oauth2 protocol?
17:52  Yhg1s: fliebel: you cannot. implement an iterable class that does what you want instead.
17:52  Yhg1s: fliebel: or, usually better, don't try to add operator overloading to things that don't really make sense.
17:52  tastefullvenom: pYhgis: i need the python oauth2 module
17:52  reeniginEesreveR: dash, im looking for a bare minimal example ... for learning purpose only
17:52  takeshita_kenji: It looks like .wait() returns before a subprocess exits on Windows
17:52  takeshita_kenji: .
17:52  fliebel: Yhg1s: I'm implementing unit generators in Python, so it does make sense.
17:53  Blacklance34: back again
17:53  Yhg1s: tastefullvenom: then google can point you to it.
17:53  Yhg1s: fliebel: I'm not convinced, but that's ok, I don't need to be.
17:53  Atlantic777: I have to make a list of up to ten objects but I must have ability to add object to the list, and to add more lists. :D I'm starting with python so I don't know what would be the best way to solve this. So, again. I add objects to the list, when I reach ten, I open new list.
17:54  fliebel: Yhg1s: So where do I get a lazy iterable class I can use?
17:54  dash: reeniginEesreveR: Why do you want to learn from a "bare minimal example" instead of an actual program that works?
17:54  takeshita_kenji: So...how do I wait for a process on Windows if .wait() and .communicate() return prematurely?
17:54  dash: fliebel: what's a "unit generator"?
17:54  dash: Atlantic777: which part of that is hard?
17:54  Yhg1s: fliebel: you write it.
17:55  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: it sounds like you're not really waiting for the right process. Is the process you starting spawning more processes? Are you involving the shell?
17:55  Atlantic777: dash, I'm trying to make I class page and notebook, but I can't append a page to the notebook.
17:55  reeniginEesreveR: dash, the same reason why they teach 2+2=4 instead of "(4/2) * 10 - 6 * 3" when starting with mathematics
17:55  reeniginEesreveR: :)
17:55  dash: reeniginEesreveR: this isn't mathematics
17:56  fliebel: dash: Basically something that spits a list of floats that renders to a waveform. They are used in digital syhtesis. So I'd implment that as a generator, but I need to do calcualtions on them. eg combine 2 sine waves.
17:56  dash: reeniginEesreveR: what is your goal?
17:56  takeshita_kenji: I'm spawning several processes, all with an associated Popen object.
17:56  takeshita_kenji: I'm calling .wait() on all of the Popen objects.
17:56  reeniginEesreveR: dash, i am just curious as to how it is done
17:56  dash: fliebel: hm, i would imagine numpy is more suitable for that. why a generator?
17:56  takeshita_kenji: It returns immediately, but leaves all of the child processes runnnig.
17:56  takeshita_kenji: *running
17:56  dash: reeniginEesreveR: why?
17:56  Atlantic777: fliebel, try the numpy
17:56  dash: Atlantic777: why can't you?
17:56  fliebel: dash: because I don't know NumPy.
17:57  dash: fliebel: it's easy to figure out :)
17:57  fliebel: I will check it out.
17:57  reeniginEesreveR: due to my nature of curiosity
17:57  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: sounds like the process you started is done, but it spawned one or more processes that are still running.
17:57  takeshita_kenji: Nope.
17:58  takeshita_kenji: I wrote the Python code for the other processes.
17:58  takeshita_kenji: .wait() works perfectly fine on Mac OS X and Linux.
17:58  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: and yet that's the only explanation for the description you give.
17:58  tastefullvenom: Yhgis:  i had already downloaded the module which i found through google and i go this when i tried to install it htttp://pastebin.com/2P9BLZcw ..... cant understand why it gives error.  can you pls give it a look
17:58  takeshita_kenji: It doesn't work on Windows.
17:58  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282268/ (repasted for tastefullvenom)
17:58  dash: reeniginEesreveR: then read flumotion.
17:58  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: do you have a reproducable example?
17:58  takeshita_kenji: Yes.
17:58  tastefullvenom: Yhgis:  sorry this the correct link http://pastebin.com/2P9BLZcw
17:58  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282269/ (repasted for tastefullvenom)
17:59  Yhg1s: tastefullvenom: it depends on httplib2, which is a third-party package, but setuptools (which oauth2 apparently uses) can't find it to install it for you. Install httplib2 first.
17:59  Atlantic777: dash, here's the code http://pastebin.com/4mkxeLmu
17:59  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282270/ (repasted for Atlantic777)
18:01  dash: Atlantic777: ok, what about it?
18:01  takeshita_kenji: http://pastebin.com/HUwhhtYv
18:01  infobob: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282273/ (repasted for takeshita_kenji)
18:01  tpratt: Atlantic777: I wouldn't set attributes to mutable objects at the class level like that.
18:01  dash: yeah that's not real happy
18:01  takeshita_kenji: The thing is, once it blocks after reaching the end of the code, hitting ctrl+c in Windows causes all of the child processes to exit cleanly as expected.
18:02  Atlantic777: Umm I'm lost. :D Ok, how can I append an array into another array? That's the problem.
18:03  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: and do you see the same behaviour if you make it execute just, say 'python -c "import time; time.sleep(300)" ?
18:03  takeshita_kenji: It looks like it is waiting for the first processed I spawned at the beginning, but not the others.
18:04  dash: Atlantic777: by "array" do you mean "list"? :)
18:04  dash: Atlantic777: lists are objects like anything else, you can put them in lists.
18:04  takeshita_kenji: Nope.
18:04  Isvara: Atlantic777: list1.extend(list2)
18:04  takeshita_kenji: It looks like problems like this are known: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100624/python-on-windows-how-to-wait-for-multiple-child-processes
18:05  Isvara: Atlantic777: (If I understood your question correctly.)
18:05  dash: Isvara: that's not the same thing, though.
18:05  JodaZ: python, threads, a good idea ?
18:05  nosklo: JodaZ: yes, no, maybe?
18:05  dash: JodaZ: python, yes. Threads, not so much.
18:05  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: well, you're not waiting for multiple processes. you're just waiting for one, as far as I can tell, namely the gtest one.
18:05  takeshita_kenji: Look after the finally:
18:06  JodaZ: dash, what kinda threads does python have ?
18:06  takeshita_kenji: Waiting for gtest works.  Waiting for the servlets doesn't.
18:06  takeshita_kenji: In fact, it looks like the server doesn't even get the CTRL_C_EVENT.
18:06  fliebel: dash: I looked at numpy. So far it looks like a bunch of nested lists to me. It also doesn't mention iterating. Can I just extend their array thing and add and __iter__ method?
18:06  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: the servlets list is empty. you never append anything to it.
18:06  dash: fliebel: the point of numpy is that many times you can _avoid_ iteration :)
18:06  takeshita_kenji: Argh, thanks for catching that.
18:06  dash: JodaZ: it just uses the OS's thred library
18:07  dash: JodaZ: what do you want to do?
18:07  fliebel: dash: numpy doesn't give you infinite lists, does it?
18:07  dash: fliebel: no, of course not
18:07  JodaZ: spawn some threads, dash ^^
18:07  dash: JodaZ: that's a how not a what
18:07  dash: JodaZ: what do you want to do?
18:07  nosklo: JodaZ: in order to do what?
18:08  takeshita_kenji: Okay, now we're to a different problem.
18:08  fliebel: dash: So is it still useful if I want to have infinite lists generated on the fly?
18:08  JodaZ: to download some files in parallel to memory and flush them out to disk after parsing
18:08  takeshita_kenji: It waits for the servlets after sending CTRL_C_EVENT, but the servlets never exit.
18:08  dash: fliebel: generated from what?
18:08  takeshita_kenji: Shouldn't they be raising KeyboardInterrupt?
18:08  dash: JodaZ: use twisted.web.client for that
18:08  dash: JodaZ: no need for threads
18:08  pr100: fliebel: in python lists are finite...
18:09  JodaZ: dash, custom protocool
18:09  dash: or write a program that downloads one file, and run it several times.
18:09  fliebel: pr100: Not if you use generators.
18:09  dash: JodaZ: oh, even better. twisted is the best choice for implementing custom protocols
18:09  dash: fliebel: generators aren't lists though
18:09  pr100: then it's not a list - in the python sense
18:09  catlee: hello
18:09  dash: fliebel: anyway here's a thing: http://web.mit.edu/6.02/www/s2009/dsptools/index.html
18:09  catlee: I'm getting a really weird error in my code
18:09  takeshita_kenji: Using .terminate() causes socket problems.  The processes catch KeyboardInterrupt and do a clean shutdown.
18:09  JodaZ: dash, hmm, that might be a good approach, but since i need to do multiple downloads and turn them all to one file it might be not that good an idea
18:09  catlee: I'm basically doing 'for k in d.keys(): del d[k]'
18:10  catlee: and every once in a while I get a KeyError
18:10  dash: JodaZ: i'd write a protocol implementation with twisted then.
18:10  JodaZ: dash, also, twisted is nice for servers, but clients, meh...
18:10  fliebel: dash: generated from… anything. Or from thin air, like a sine wave.
18:10  dash: catlee: let me guess, you're using python 3
18:10  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: depends on whether the event ever arrives at the Python code, and whether the python code handles that properly.
18:10  dash: JodaZ: what's the difference? :)
18:10  howlymowly: hi poeple.. short simple question:  what's the quickest way to make a list of datetime-objects? I just want a list of days in datetime forma between two specific dates
18:10  dash: JodaZ: there's basically a single like of code different between clients and servers
18:10  takeshita_kenji: I don't think the event ever arrives.
18:11  dash: fliebel: "generated from anything" doesn't make much sense. :)
18:11  JodaZ: dash, in servers the different client connections need to be separated, in a client the different connections to the server usually work as one
18:11  takeshita_kenji: Even with appending to the list, it still works under non-Windows.
18:11  dash: JodaZ: i could just as easily say the opposite ;)
18:12  takeshita_kenji: I also tried reverting to .terminate() instead of .send_signal(CTRL_C_EVENT), and with the fix both methods behave the same way.
18:12  takeshita_kenji: It really seems like a Windows-specific idiosyncrasy.
18:13  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: are the servlets doing anythign that might be blocking the event? Does it work if you make them do nothing but wait indefinitely, for example?
18:13  catlee: dash: nope, 2.6
18:13  takeshita_kenji: Nope.  They just do a sleep(300) repeatedly, waiting for a KeyboardInterrupt.
18:14  catlee: dash: so, 'k in d' is False, but 'k in d.keys()' is True
18:14  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: and using p.terminate() instead doesn't work?
18:14  catlee: dash: k is a bound method
18:14  Yhg1s: (I couldn't parse your earlier comment ont he subject.)
18:14  takeshita_kenji: Correct.
18:15  pr100: fliebel: you want to have e.g. a generator x yielding 1,2,3,..; another y, yielding 6,7,8 and implement something that allows you to write  x+y that yields 7,9,11,... ?
18:15  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: peculiar.
18:15  fliebel: pr100: Exactly!
18:15  al_admeld: takeshita_kenji: ctrl+Q is windows, make sure youre account for that
18:16  Yhg1s: fliebel: '(a+b for a, b in itertools.izip(x, y))' then.
18:16  StaticShock: is there any equivalent to list.remove that doesn't throw an exception if the element is missing?
18:16  takeshita_kenji: Q+
18:16  takeshita_kenji: *Q?
18:16  JodaZ: dash, hmm, as i want to keep a bit of data blobs in memory and maybe shuffle it arround a bit, how do i do mutable datablobs ?
18:16  StaticShock: i just want to make sure that some element is absent, so it doesn't matter to me if it's present or absent at the time of removal
18:16  RootLUG: Hi, is there something like wx.html.HtmlWindow which I can use with wx.Notebook (like wx.Panel)?  need to render some simple HTML in Notebook Page.
18:16  fliebel: Yhg1s: I'll chew on that. And my diner. See you later!
18:16  Yhg1s: StaticShock: nope, not really.
18:16  StaticShock: damn
18:16  al_admeld: takeshita_kenji: ctl + Q is quit on windows
18:16  StaticShock: alright
18:17  Yhg1s: al_admeld: throwing out random and pointless comments again?
18:17  Yhg1s: al_admeld: please stop doing so.
18:17  takeshita_kenji: I'm pretty sure that doesn't apply to the DOS window.
18:17  takeshita_kenji: That's why there's CTRL_C_EVENT.
18:17  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: since the problem is with p.terminate()/p.send_signal(), how about cutting out the seemingly unnecessary gtest execution, and just starting a process and terminating it. Does that work?
18:18  al_admeld: takeshita_kenji: cntl + c is copy.
18:18  sly007: Hi, I'm using old style classes, should I call SuperClass.__init__(self) or SuperClass.__init__() in my __init__ method?
18:19  ssbr: sly007: only the former will work, and it's the correct thing to do. Unless, of course, you have no reason to use old-style classes, in which case the correct thing is new-style classes and super()
18:19  Yhg1s: sly007: the former. the latter does not work.
18:19  takeshita_kenji: al_admeld: You are incorrect in this case.  The DOS prompt uses ctrl+c for killing processes just like Unix shells.  ctrl+q is for GUIs only.
18:20  howlymowly: the easiest way to create a list of das in datetime format i came up with, is: [d1+datetime.timedelta(i) for i in xrange((d2-d1).days) ] is there anything easier, as I have to manually type this interactivly?
18:20  warz: hrm. i have a certain function that is looping over objects and appending data from them to a global list of this data from all objects. but, the data being appended to the global list is also a list - it's a list of dictionaries. so i'm ending up with a list of lists of dictionaries. is there a way to "explode" that internal list into individual dictionaries so i can have just a list of dictionaries instead of a list of lists of dicts
18:21  takeshita_kenji: Yhg1s: Without the gtest execution, it does pretty much the same thing.
18:21  takeshita_kenji: Just waits until I manually enter ctrl+c.
18:21  ssbr: warz: use the extend method instead, perhaps
18:21  Brend: warz: Maybe you should be extending your global list at each step, instead of appending a sub-list
18:21  Brend: (Or, flatten it afterwards)
18:22  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: which Python version are you using?
18:22  takeshita_kenji: 2.7.
18:22  Yhg1s: let's see if I can reproduce it.
18:23  takeshita_kenji: Each of the servlets and the server have a separate thread, but it's killed in the KeyboardInterrupt except block.  The KeyboardInterrupt except block isn't even reached; it contains a print statement before anything else, but nothing is printed.

18:46  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: so *something* in the servlet is preventing the event from arriving or the process from actually being terminated.
18:46  takeshita_kenji: But it's still strange that it works perfectly well on non-Windows.
18:47  Yhg1s: takeshita_kenji: nah, process and signal semantics are entirely different on non-windows platforms.
18:47  ssbr: takeshita_kenji: other OSes are better about killing processes.
18:47  Yhg1s: I would say 'more sensible', but that's my POSIX bias.
18:47  ssbr: Yhg1s: you'd be entirely correct. There are some circumstances in windows where you cannot kill a process at all. THat isn't sensible. :(

18:55  dash: lemiffe: classes don't have filenames.
18:55  lemiffe: say in PHP we sometimes do classname.class.php to note it is specifically a class
18:55  lemiffe: is there anything similar in Python?

18:55  offbyone:

18:55  lemiffe: Yes I know dash
18:55  offbyone: od.items() has k3, k2, k1 in order
18:55  offbyone: WTF?
18:56  lemiffe: What I mean is a filename to indicate it contains a class
18:56  shylent: offbyone: well, those are keyword arguments, right?
18:56  dash: offbyone: guess what! keyword args aren't ordered
18:56  offbyone: Gah

18:56  offbyone: Shit.

18:56  offbyone: That... makes sense, but christ, what an unintuitive result :)
18:56  lemiffe: dash: OK, thanks, I was just wondering.
18:56  dash: lemiffe: a python module can any number of classes in it
18:57  lemiffe: yes I know that :)
18:57  dash: offbyone: get a better intuition ;D
18:57  offbyone: Funny bit; that tidbit is the highlight that google shows for the ordereddict search.
18:57  lemiffe: I was just wondering if there was a standard nomenclature  or something
18:57  offbyone: dash: I contend that my intuition works pretty well.
18:57  offbyone: Might even be worth making keyword arg ordering a feature in an upcoming python version?
18:57  offbyone: It could probably be patched in...
18:57  ssbr: That'd be an excellent idea, in my books.
18:57  dash: offbyone: Hmm
18:58  ssbr: We do have OrderedDicts now.
18:58  dash: offbyone: i might use that idea :)
18:58  ssbr: (but that'd mean taking OrderedDict outside of the collections module?)
18:58  offbyone: I'm half tempted to see if I can get my feet wet in python development just to try it.
18:58  offbyone: Yeah, it's a natural consequence.
18:58  erb: any of you are coding python for android?

18:59  mr0t: i might be out of my league in asking this but here goes: if I want to create x variables named 'string' + x (where x is counter in while loop), can I do that in python (3.1), and if so how? (my textbook doesnt have an answer)
18:59  offbyone: mr0t: What are you trying to accomplish with that?
18:59  shylent: mr0t: you use a container for that
18:59  erb: dash, oww really?
18:59  shylent: like, a dict
18:59  offbyone: I'd recommend a dict

19:00  shylent: but.. :P
19:00  shylent: typing in* whatever
19:00  mr0t: trying to take info from a file and yeah, i figured i'd use a dict to store the info, before sorting
19:02  ssbr: I dunno why everyone is saying dict.
19:02  lemiffe: As a standard, should we place function comments above the function declaration, or inside of it? (i.e. """this class does this""")
19:03  jsemar: mr0t, you could use an object, like class Foo(object)pass   and then f = Foo(); setattr(f, 'string%s' % x, somevalue)
19:03  ssbr: if you want var0, var1, var2, var3, the usual transformation is to a list: var[0], var[1], var[2], var[3]
19:03  ssbr: lemiffe: those aren't comments, they're strings, and they only work directly below the def/class line.
19:04  ssbr: (or at the very top of a module)
19:04  ssbr: they're called docstrings
19:04  lemiffe: yep, that's what I mean, I forgot the real name, thanks ssbr
19:05  mr0t: ssbr, jsemar: thanks, I think I can tackle this now.
19:05  jsemar: mr0t if you really wanna go off the deep end (the whole premise is unpythonic), you can do locals()['string%s' %x] = somevalue
19:06  shylent: woah
19:06  dash: jsemar: don't tell people to do terrible things.
19:06  jsemar: i know right
19:06  ssbr: jsemar: that doesn't even work.

19:06  jsemar: work
19:07  ssbr: jsemar: you can't create new local variables at run-time.
19:07  ssbr: Unless your "locals" are global.

19:07  dash: ssbr: whether it works is hardly relevant
19:07  offbyone: Hm. Okay, I'll see if I can figure it out from other places.
19:07  offbyone: Thanks!
19:07  ssbr: Do it in a function, why don't you?
19:07  dash: jsemar: this is never a good idea
19:07  dash: ssbr: don't be terrible.
19:07  jsemar: oh i totally agree
19:07  ssbr: Yeah, it's also an idea straight from the mind of incompetent satan-worshippers
19:07  ssbr: But it doesn't even work.
19:08  jsemar: ok you are right, it doesnt work inside function scope
19:08  jsemar: mostly i was being glib
19:08  dash: jsemar: don't
19:09  ssbr: Don't be glib about code.
19:09  jsemar: i said 'if you really wanna go off the deep end'
19:09  dash: jsemar: yes. don't.
19:09  ssbr: Right. Don't.
19:09  jsemar: notice my first answer was much more reasonable
19:10  dash: jsemar: well, it was still bad
19:10  dash: jsemar: given that he should just use a list instead.
19:10  ssbr: I am of the opinion that your second answer was better.
19:10  jsemar: lol
19:10  ssbr: Because while it seems more awful, it doesn't work.
19:10  ssbr: Better to give up on evil entirely, than successfully do a small evil thing. :(
19:11  Isvara: Is it just my imagination, or have at least three people asked about creating variables at runtime just this morning?
19:11  jsemar: see, list doesn't answer his question eitehr
19:11  ssbr: jsemar: It does what he wants.
19:11  ssbr: What he wants is impossible.
19:11  ssbr: (i.e. to create variables at runtime)
19:11  ssbr: Errgh, used the wrong words
19:11  ssbr: what he *asked for* is impossible.
19:11  jsemar: i agree
19:12  ssbr: What he wants, is achievable, through different means -- like a list.
19:12  sente: if i have a list of lists, how can i create a new list of lists, adding 0's or None's to the end of each sublist if the given sublist is shorter than the length of the longest sublist?
19:12  ssbr: jsemar: so suggest something that does what people want, but is not evil
19:12  dash: sente: a loop :)
19:12  ssbr: rather than something that does what people want, but is evil.
19:12  sente: dash: :) i didn't know if there was a more clever, less reinventing-the-wheel type way
19:12  ssbr: eh, two loops.
19:13  ssbr: or one loop and max with key=len
19:15  sente: what if i had a list of iterables, and i want a new list of iterables each one returning None if that iterator is exhausted as long as other atleast one of the iterables still yields elements?
19:15  jsemar: sente: the only answer is to write the code for you
19:15  jsemar: its like a 4 line loop, just write it
19:16  dash: sente: there's an itertools thing for that, IIRC
19:16  dash: in 2.6 and later
19:16  dash: izip_longest
19:16  sente: dash: thanks
19:17  sente: jsemar: it seemed more indepth than just a 4-liner to me, but i'm also somewhat inexperienced in this type of thing

19:34  dash: comhero: the latter changes L1.
19:34  comhero: oh right
19:34  comhero: thanks
19:34  dash: (and returns None)
19:34  ThomK: Exception is raised by request.session dictionary.
19:36  dash: ThomK: call .get() instead of indexing then
19:36  shylent: django has specific functionality for that
19:36  shylent: like the login_requred decorator
19:36  shylent: so that you don't have to do this stuff yourself
19:37  shylent: perhaps you should read up on django.contrib.auth, there's lots of 'batteries' in there

19:43  neataroni: gooooood morning
19:43  dash: really, how can you tell
19:44  neataroni: i am having a dickens of a time trying to get libxml2 and libxslt installed via macports
19:44  dash: yeah osx is unpleasant
19:45  arkanes_: installing libxml is easy with homebrew!
19:45  arkanes_: (macports is bad)
19:46  dash: heh.
19:46  arkanes_: although on second though I might be telling a lie, I think I built lxml using the system libxml
19:47  neataroni: man, i had people telling me i HAD to use macports last night
19:47  neataroni: it looks like it should rock
19:47  dash: arkanes_: he's building scrapy which uses the libxml2 python wrapper, not lxml
19:47  neataroni: but for some reason i cant find where its putting libxml2 and stuff
19:47  arkanes_: dash: oh dear
19:47  dash: yeah.
19:47  arkanes_: neataroni: just one of the many problems with macports
