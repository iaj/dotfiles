16:51  hemanth: magcius, but so far, bash along with them, has helped me to do think quicker than any!
16:51  magcius: sabalaba, http://bpaste.net/show/10019/
16:51  magcius: hemanth, start from scratch
16:52  magcius: hemanth, bash isn't really a language
16:52  magcius: it has some language-like features that people rarely use (arrays)
16:52  hemanth: magcius, i'm doing py from 2 years now, doing pygtk and pyqt recently
16:52 --- Channel #python was synced in 76 seconds
16:52  magcius: hemanth, ok
16:52  magcius: hemanth, there's nothing wrong with using bash
16:52  hemanth: magcius, bash4 has array!
16:52  magcius: hemanth, yes, I know
16:52  magcius: a lot of people don't use them though
16:53  magcius: or know about them
16:53  magcius: hemanth, also, bash has had arrays far longer than from version 4
16:53  hemanth: magcius, :) associative that too, but most of the bash hacker are not happy with array introduction :)
16:53  magcius: I don't give a shit.
16:53  hemanth: magcius, OOP in bash :D
16:53  magcius: I don't care.
16:53  magcius: bash is a glue tool
16:54  magcius: It wouldn't make sense to do anything other than strings and arrays
16:54  magcius: Arrays were introduced because it was hard to use strings with spaces and command parsing and all that
16:54  hemanth: let be glue tool so what, it gets things done faster and easier
16:54  magcius: Sure.
16:54  magcius: I never negated that.
16:54  magcius: I use bash all the time, even still
16:55  magcius: But that doesn't defeat the fact that you need something like cp or grep or curl to get things done
16:55  magcius: If you could do anything of use in regular bash without executing commands, I'd be amazed.
16:55  hemanth: yes, but i feel that is the advantage
16:56  magcius: SUre.
16:56  magcius: Anyway, this isn't about python
16:57  hemanth: magcius, i just felt cos of this nature of bash the one liners that can be done, is hard to beat by other languages
16:57  magcius: hemanth, take it to #python-offtopic
16:58  hemanth: sure :)
17:00  b52: magcius: wouldnt it be a good idea to return a deferred for command_list_end to see when hes done with all commands?
