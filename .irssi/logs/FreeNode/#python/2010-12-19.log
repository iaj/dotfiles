02:03  KirkMcDonald: jeff2: No, that is incorrect.
02:04  KirkMcDonald: jeff2: Pass it the module object, not the contents of the file.
02:04  scummos: KirkMcDonald: mmh, looks like i need to assemble that range information myself :(
02:04 --- Channel #python was synced in 127 seconds
02:05  jeff2: KirkMcDonald: so it is not possible to disassemble given the file contents?
02:06  altin: Sergio965, Ya I did this before but its showing the lines that are suposed to be shown just when you pres no
02:06  jeff2: KirkMcDonald: also it seems "import hello" executes the top-level code, and dis.dis(hello) doesn't disassemble it :(
02:06  KirkMcDonald: jeff2: It disassembles all of the functions within the module.
02:07  Sergio965: altin: Move the lines where you need them to. Check out the 'if' and 'else' statements.
02:07  jeff2: KirkMcDonald: any idea how to disassemble the code not in a module? for example if I had a script hello.py with nothing but: print "Hello World"
02:10  jeff2: KirkMcDonald: nevermind, found I need to use the 'marshal' module
02:10  scummos: hm, a regular expression hack can't be the solution here :(
02:13  scummos: i could make every foo.bar.baz a foo.bar(0).baz(0) before parsing, then i'd get the range information -- this is... stupid
02:15  Sember: http://paste2.org/p/1149881 how can I best translate this php into a python script?
02:16  Sember: I want to parse data from a .txt file like ( variable = the data we want )
02:16  scummos: Sember: f = open('test.txt'); for line in f: etc
02:16  Sember: what about the parsing?
02:16  scummos: well, use functions like .split() etc
02:17  Sember: http://paste2.org/p/1149893 the data we want to parse
02:18  Sember: the structure is consistent like that, first, string = then data

14:47  lvh: BrianE: It's a work in progress. Probably a year or two left or so.
14:48  cousteau: nosklo, so in __cinit__ I can only call creation arguments and cdef'd attributes of self, but not any method or Python attribute, right?
14:48  lvh: BrianE: (IIRC, BDFL's words: we're halfway in a 5 year plan, or something like that.)
14:48  lvh: matrix: Again, that depends if it's supposed to work on 2.x or 3.x.
14:48  BrianE: Aah
14:49  tpratt: matrix, there's still one raw_input() call in there.
14:49 --- Channel #python was synced in 127 seconds
14:49  tpratt: matrix, assuming that's the problem.  If you're getting an error, also post the error.
14:51  matrix:     soru = raw_input()
14:51  matrix: NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
14:51  BrianE: matrix: Try `soru = int( input() )`
14:51  bahamas: matrix: use input(). raw_input doesn't exist in python 3
14:51  BrianE: Then `if soru == 1`, etc, instead of == "1"
14:53  qwerty1793: hi, when using multiprocessing, is there a way to determine how far through a map I am? For example http://paste.pocoo.org/show/306912/
14:54  bahamas: nosklo: apparently my problem comes from a bug in oursql
14:54  kerio: qwerty1793: i gets passed to some_big_function
14:54  matrix: soru = int( input() )
14:54  matrix: this not work
14:54  matrix: i press 1 but
14:54  matrix: not work
14:55  qwerty1793: kerio: but max_num doesn't
14:55  tpratt: matrix, 'not work' is meaningless.  paste the error messages if you want help.
14:55  kerio: so pass that too
14:55  cousteau: 2.x's input() would be equivalent to 3.x's eval(input())
14:55  qwerty1793: kerio: how do i pass more than 1 variable?
14:56  kerio: qwerty1793: hmm... some combination of itertools.izip and itertools.repeat
14:57  tpratt: matrix, also, you have to press 'enter' after you press '1' -- just checking :)
14:58  qwerty1793: kerio: ok, how about if it works through a list instead of a range? i.e. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/306923/
14:58  kerio: qwerty1793: is this a quiz? enumerate()
15:01  qwerty1793: kerio: awesome thanks, that's just what i was looking for
15:04  cnf: how can i check the name of a classes parent?
15:04  cnf: or check if a class is a child of a certain class?
15:06  thevishy: tree   = etree.parse(StringIO(broken_html), parser)
15:07  thevishy: is says StringIO not defined , while I thought its something inbuilt
15:07  FransWillem: Would anyone be able to point me to a quick reference/introduction to python from a C++, Java, or Javascript programmer ?
15:08  kerio: FransWillem: docs.python.org/tut

15:33  BrianE: EG: current_contract => ContractOne, ContractTwo => subclass of ContractOne, check_contract => "ContractTwo"?
15:34  thevishy: i need a good pythoin distribution that can help manage modules better - what are the options , the default Python(IDLE) is not going a good job
15:34  cnf: no, they are ALL subclasses
15:34  kerio: also is there a way to get arbitrary negative numbers in slices?
15:34  maximveksler: Anyone?
15:34  bahamas: thevishy: i don't know what you mean by python distribution, but you should use the python shell, not IDLE

15:35  varnie: hi. i use my relative path for specifying directory with resources for my program. it works well. but it gets broken after i installed my program with setup.py install. what should i check firstly to fix this wrong behaviour?
15:35 --- Channel #python was synced in 127 seconds
15:35  cnf: BrianE: it's a LOT of code, i would not know what to paste
15:35  genjix: varnie: use os.path
15:35  genjix: http://pastebin.com/88xYWYu4
15:35  infobob: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/700/ (repasted for genjix)
15:35  cnf: hmm, maybe i can make a mock up
15:35  genjix: anyone can tell me what's wrong with my syntax for class methods?
15:35  BrianE: cnf: Just the code where you need to check / verify / etc, with relevant comments as to what variables are
15:35  thevishy: bahamas : i am having trouble installing modules
15:35  kerio: genjix: classmethods have cls as their first argument
15:35  varnie: yes, my resources_path looks smth like: os.path.join("impl","resources")
15:36  genjix: thanks kerio
15:36  genjix: varnie: http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html
15:36  varnie: thanks, i have to check it out
15:36  kerio: if you don't want that, you should use a staticmethod
15:36  tpratt: cnf, would zope.interface be of anyhelp?
15:36  kerio: but if your method is not related to the class or the instance, why isn't it a function?
15:36  cnf: BrianE: i don't have any code to check that yet, because i can't figure it out atm ^^;
15:36  genjix: kerio: i'm using the class as a namespace
15:36  thevishy: bahamas: which do u use ? default python or maybe something like active state
15:36  cnf: also, http://paste.pound-python.org/ is just a blank page for me
15:36  kerio: genjix: use a dict
15:37  genjix: a dict... why?
15:37  BrianE: cnf: Well... write a paste of what variables you have, what they are, any relevant class headers, etc
15:37  cnf: tpratt: i have no idea, i don't know zope
15:37  bahamas: maximveksler: where is servicegeoip? in /root/install/deploy?
15:37  BrianE: I'm not really getting the situation you're describing
15:37  bahamas: thevishy: what trouble are you having with installing modules?
15:38  maximveksler: Yes.
15:39  kunguz: I found the answer for my question as follows: a.subs(x,5) , thanks anyway
15:39  thevishy: bahamas: http://pastebin.com/G2VdyMpV
15:39  infobob: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/701/ (repasted for thevishy)
15:39  bahamas: cnf: maybe you should try to create a minimal example of your hierarchy. it would be easier to understand what you want to check
15:39  tpratt: cnf, look into it.  it sounds kind of like your using inheritance as interfaces.  That may not be the case, but zope.interface might help.
15:39  varnie: hmm.. and which func from os should i use?
15:40  thevishy: bahamas: effbot shows the module here also http://effbot.org/zone/element-tidylib.htm
15:40  maximveksler: bahamas: I guess I'm missing some init or something to make python understand servicegeoip is a packge and deploy.py is a module?
15:40  bahamas: thevishy: that looks like a problem with the connection. have you tried again? alternatively, you can try using pip instead: pip install your_package
15:40  thevishy: or perhaps can u tell me a method to install it , I would follow that - I am new to Python hence module etc not sure
15:40  varnie: genjix, i cannot fix my issue still
15:40  cnf: tpratt: i'm not writing a web app, though
15:40  bahamas: maximveksler: well, there should be a __init__.py, yes
15:40  thevishy: pip ? how do I install pip
15:41  genjix: varnie: look on ggogle for tutorials on using os path
15:41  maximveksler: in servicegeoip ?
15:41  varnie: genjix, i just don't get an idea of using it. what should i achieve ?
15:41  maximveksler: Can it be empty?
15:41  bahamas: maximveksler: yes
15:41  bahamas: to both
15:41  varnie: should i resolve its absolute path and use it, or what
15:42  maximveksler: bahamas: I'll go try it. thanks.
15:42  bahamas: thevishy: the package manager found the link. it's just that a network problem occurred. try again
15:43  genjix: varnie: maybe setup.py installs it into non-relative paths
15:43  genjix: like on linux /usr/bin /usr/share/myapp .etc
15:43  thevishy: bahamas : http://paste.pocoo.org/show/306938/
15:43  thevishy: No local packages or download links found for elementtidy
15:43  thevishy: Best match: None
15:43  genjix: idk, i have no experience in this issue. sorry
15:43  bahamas: thevishy: to install pip, do easy_install pip
15:44  tpratt: cnf, zope.interface is just a module, it doesn't have anything to do with web apps.
15:44  varnie: my "start" script installed into /usr/local/bin and all the other subscripts and that resources installed into /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
15:44  maximveksler: bahamas: that works great, thanks but now I have a different problem...
15:44  thevishy: ok easy_install is something thats 3rd party ?
15:44  tpratt: cnf, a lot of projects use zope.interface (Twisted, for one) that don't use anything else from zope.
15:44  bahamas: thevishy: you already have it. you just used it to try to install the previous package
15:45  thevishy: bahama : No distributions at all found for elementtidy
15:45  maximveksler: I was planning on calling a function I define in the "main" python install_upstart_script() yet it can't find it when I call the deploy() function
15:45  maximveksler: Why is that so?
15:45  cnf: tpratt: i still don't know what it does, though
15:46  bahamas: cnf: it formally defines interfaces
15:46  tpratt: cnf, Oh.  I see.  In that case I suggest giving up.
15:46  cnf: yes, very constructive
15:47  thevishy: pip install result :  No distributions at all found for elementtidy
15:47  thevishy: bahamas ^
15:47  bahamas: thevishy: then download the archive and install it manually with python setup.py install
15:48  daemonkeeper: Is there a way to emulate Perl's redo operation in Python?  That is to run the current block within a loop again without evaluating the condition again?
15:49  bahamas: maximveksler: is install_upstart_script() defined in the deploy module?
15:49  cnf: BrianE:  it's pseudo code ish, but it's something like that http://pastie.textmate.org/1389877
15:50  maximveksler: bahamas: No, in the main "module"
15:50  maximveksler: I would like to access it from the deploy module.

16:03  lvh: qwerty1793: Ideally, things in a map should have as few side effects as possible, and when they do, they shouldn't affect the smae things
16:03  lvh: qwerty1793: (That'd be mutating global state, which is usually bad)
16:03  PhilipPhilip: So if something is NOT(True and False) then it is true because something "true AND false" must be false, but because it is NOT this, it is therefore true?  Holy mother, this screwing my head.
16:03  bahamas: maximveksler: btw, why aren't you putting install_upstart_script in deploy? then, you can use it in deploy and also in main because you import deploy in main
16:03  lvh: qwerty1793: Communicate results to the parent, let it do all the talking
16:03  qwerty1793: lvh: how do i do that?
16:03  lvh: PhilipPhilip: Right.
16:03  PhilipPhilip: thanks lvh - i'm slowly but surely getting it
16:03  lvh: qwerty1793: Well, I use ampoule, which makes it easy.
16:03  lvh: qwerty1793: No idea how you do it with mp.Pool.map, though
16:03  BrianE: lvh: Is there a way to get an instance's parent?
16:03  lvh: I can wager a guess: mp has synchronized data structures such as queues
16:03  maximveksler: bahamas: because I will have several deploy.py functions (for each application) and I don't want to duplicate the install_upstart_script() code...
16:03  lvh: Push a message into that queue instead of to sys.stdout
16:03  lvh: BrianE: What does that even mean
16:03  bahamas: cnf: you either map each class to a string or use __name__ and __bases__, but maybe someone has a better idea
16:03  maximveksler: Suggestions, please?
16:03  BrianE: Sorry
16:03  BrianE: lvh: http://pastie.textmate.org/1389877
16:03  BrianE: I meant "the name of the parent class of a class instance"
16:04  bahamas: maximveksler: then put it in a separate module and import it in the other modules
16:04  BrianE: lvh: Lines 40-43 are pseudo-code
16:05  bahamas: lvh: he has an instance and he wants to get the parent of the instance's class
16:05  lvh: BrianE: Why are you doing that? Python is a duck typed language, you're typically not supposed to care about what position objects have in an inheritance lattice
16:05 --- Channel #python was synced in 240 seconds
16:05  BrianE: And other_type on line 39 is "CTOther", not CTOther
16:05  maximveksler: bahamas: but it's a module for just 1 function, which is only interesting to my purposes (during installtion) ?
16:05  lvh: Okay, in that case "parent" is still ambiguous since Python supports MI
16:05  maximveksler: bahamas: Is this recommendaed ?\
16:05  BrianE: lvh: It's for cnf - he's using objects ... in fact, that's the problem
16:05  thevishy: bahamas: I am trying some other module now -> http://countergram.com/open-source/pytidylib/docs/index.html , but please see the error I am getting after trying to import the module ( I installed with PIP ) - the error is File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\tidylib\__init__.py", line 71, in <module>     raise OSError("Could not load libtidy using any of these names: %s" % (",".join(LIB_NAMES)))
16:06  BrianE: cnf: Don't use objects and classes to check something that isn't to do with objects and classes
16:06  bahamas: lvh: well, since the question is formulated like that, i'm assuming it's just one parent
16:06  lvh: bahamas: Since the question is formulated like that, I'm assuming it's an XY problem
16:06  cnf: meh
16:06  BrianE: cnf: CTBasic and CTOther derive from NetworkOne, NetworkTwo, etc
16:06  lvh: Why isn't there a classattr that says what network it belongs to
16:06  BrianE: In that case, give NetworkOne and NetworkTwo an ID of sorts, eg...
16:06  bahamas: lvh: that's also possible
16:07  BrianE: Give NetworkOne and NetworkTwo a class attribute, say, "network_id = 1", "network_id = 2"
16:07  cnf: hmm
16:07  BrianE: Then compare that - NOT the classes / objects
16:07  lvh: It's fine that your *implementation* provides that interface through subclassing -- but please don't enforce that every implementation must do that
16:07  cnf: that's actually not such a bad idea, at that
16:08  cnf: can i access those attributes without having an instance of the class?
16:08  BrianE: cnf: Yes
16:08  cnf: cool
16:08  bahamas: maximveksler: sorry, i can't picture the structure of your package, but since you're talking about deploying, there are some tools out there that do this. fabric is one IIRC
16:08  lvh: cnf: Yes. Classattrs can be accessed both from instances (if there's no shadowing instanceattr) and the class.
16:09  cnf: lvh: nice. and i can access them if the name of the class is in a variable?
16:09  varnie: should setup.py update sys.path ?
16:09  cnf: var = ClassName\nvar.attribute ?
16:09  BrianE: lvh: He gets "CTBasic" from a SOAP interface somewhere, and has an instance of CTBasic
16:09  lvh: cnf: Why do you have the name of a class in a variable
16:09 --- mm11zzzzzzzzzzzz is now known as mackmoron11
16:09  kerio: lvh: that's what i asked!
16:10  lvh: cnf: var = ClassName is not having the name of the class in the variable, it's having the *class* in the variable
16:10  cnf: lvh: i don't _want_ it like that, i _get_ it like that from SOAP
16:10  lvh: var = ClassName.__class__.__name__
16:10 --- signpost is now known as mozy
16:10  lvh: Oh, you actually have a string
16:10  cnf: yes
16:10  lvh: cnf: Right, in that case you want a dispatch dict.
16:10  PhilipPhilip: Why is something that is "true and false" false? Why does the falseness override the truth?
16:10  cnf: sorry?
16:10  kerio: PhilipPhilip: wait, what
16:10  BrianE: cnf: {'CTBasic': CTBasic, 'CTOther': CTOther}
16:10  bahamas: PhilipPhilip: you just answered that earlier
16:11  lvh: classesYouSupport = [A, ..., Z]; dispatch = dict((c.__name__, c) for c in classesYouSupport)
16:11  tpratt: now we're back to where we are an hour ago
16:11  bahamas: PhilipPhilip: True and False yield False
16:11  lvh: PhilipPhilip: Because there's "and" in between.
16:11  PhilipPhilip: Oh yes.
16:11  cnf: BrianE: but i can't do that, because i can't make an instance of these classes without aditional info
16:11  cnf: which i do not have at that point in the process
16:11  lvh: PhilipPhilip: It is not true that *AND* condition one *AND* condition two are satisfied.
16:11  PhilipPhilip: because somethinc an't be true and false.. right, sorru i'm getting confused here.
16:12  cnf: lvh: what i said to BrianE
16:12  kerio: hey lvh, do you want to see how i butchered python again?
16:12  lvh: kerio: no
16:12  kerio: lvh: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/702/
16:12  lvh: cnf: I don't understand. What I described does not involve instances of classes.
16:12  lvh: cnf: You want to map a name of a class to a class, right?
16:13  cnf: classesYouSupport = [A, ..., Z] < A through Z being the classes, no?
16:13  BrianE: Yes
16:13  thevishy: can anyone tell me why I am not able to load a module despite installing it ? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/306966/
16:14  lvh: cnf: Right.
16:14  BrianE: thevishy: You can load the module "tidylib" perfectly well
16:14  cnf: i am probably misunderstanding something here, but if i do var = ClassName, i make an instance of ClassName, don't I?
16:14  PhilipPhilip: OK, last question on the topic because I don't want to annoy people, but why if something is true OR false, then it's true?
16:14  BrianE: It just spits out an error because the (C) library "libtidy" isn't installed
16:15  BrianE: tidylib is presumably a wrapper around libtidy, and so can't function without it
16:15  kerio: PhilipPhilip: you keep using that word, i do not thing it means what you think it means
16:15  thevishy: I see , so what option do I have to have something that native to Python ?
16:15  kerio: *think
16:15  tpratt: cnf, no you've made var a reference to a class object
16:15  lvh: cnf: No.
16:15  BrianE: Use your distro's package manager to (or manually) install libtidy, then it should work properly
16:15  bahamas: PhilipPhilip: True or False yields True
16:15  tpratt: cnf, var = Class() makes an instance.
16:15  cnf: hmm
16:15  lvh: cnf: o = C(*a, **kw) instantiates.
16:15  lvh: v = C just makes v the same thing as C.
16:15  cnf: ok...
16:15  lvh: I think you misunderstand how Python works: names are just names, they point to objects -- there's nothing special about a name.
16:15  BrianE: Wait
16:15  BrianE: Sorry, that's running on Windows
16:16  lvh: You can pass around modules, functions, classes... as names that have nothing to do with the original name of the thing.
16:16  lvh: Many things don't even have names -- consider lambda's, numbers...
16:16  thevishy: BrianE : libtidy is a C header , so does pip install work ?
16:17  thevishy: Yes , I run on windows - hence cannot use distro manager - I either have to look for a module that works on native python
16:17  BrianE: tidylib was installed presumably with pip, and it didn't bring libtidy with it
16:18  kerio: lvh: my code is both an argument for the removal of apply() from the builtins, and for the introduction of obj foo: as a declaration of custom objects
16:19  thevishy: Yes BrianE I installed using pip - does C headers get installed using pip ?
16:19  BrianE: thevishy: No, it expects the headers to already be installed on the system
16:20  thevishy: Right
16:20  cnf: lvh: i'm gonna mull this over a bit ^^;
16:20  tpratt: it's looking for the library (dll on windows I guess) not a header file.  you'd only need a header file for compiling.
16:21  ardian: Do you have to know Python for Django ?
16:21  thevishy: i got a work around using Lxml atleast for now
16:21  bahamas: ardian: yes
16:21  taljurf: guys, what is the most recommended way to learn python? books or online?
16:22  bahamas: taljurf: online books
16:22  tpratt: ardian, not if you're just installing a django app, but to write one, yes.
16:22  taljurf: lol
16:22  ardian: ok
16:22  kerio: taljurf: no
16:22  ardian: thanks
16:22  ardian: what's the best book for python ?
16:22  kerio: ardian: do you know how to program?
16:22  bahamas: taljurf: it depends on what you like, but there are some good available books online
16:22  kerio: if you do, read the official tutorial
16:22  kerio: otherwise, learnpythonthehardway or thinkpython
16:23  taljurf: oh
16:23  ardian: kerio, no what about books that cost $$ ?
16:23  taljurf: i think i'll go with the official thing
16:23  varnie: is it OK to distribute own resources files along with python module using setup.py?
16:23  kerio: ardian: they're not worth the said $$
16:23  bahamas: taljurf: if you have programming experience, use the tutorial, yes
16:23  ardian: aha cool
16:23  taljurf: bahamas: a bit of c++
16:23  lvh: ardian: It's hard to give advice without understanding constraints. Why do you want books that cost $$?
16:24  kerio: lvh: because more money = better than
16:24  taljurf: is it actually easier than c++ ?
16:24  bahamas: taljurf: yes
16:24  kerio: taljurf: yes - and it's also way better
16:24  ardian: Maybe books that cost have a better sense to understand the language
16:24  kerio: because it makes sense at least
16:24  bahamas: ardian: not necessarily
16:25  taljurf: ok, 1 last question, why is it so popular, especially on linux platforms
16:25  taljurf: ?
16:25  kerio: taljurf: because it's better
16:26  taljurf: kerio: u mean as outputs?
16:26  kerio: no, i mean as a language
16:26  bahamas: taljurf: syntax is clean. it's really fast to program in python. it has a lot of libraries, etc.
16:26  kerio: way better than pretty much any sensible alternative, has a very clean, easy syntax, has an object model that makes sense and has easy C bindings
16:26  taljurf: oh, that makes sense
16:27  taljurf: because even i didn't read anything about python, i sometimes find it very easy to modify py files, if i need
16:28  salat: hey... on linux i use cython to convert python code into c code. then i use distutils to build the c file. what i get is a module.so file. can i use distutils on windows the same way? meaning i get a module.dll file which acts like a python module?
16:28  thevishy: clean_html(urlfetch) returns the output I desire but how do I store it to a variable ?
16:28  taljurf: thx guys 4 the help
16:28  bahamas: thevishy: output = clean_html(urlfetch) ?
16:29  thevishy: bahamas : ok , yes it works

16:37  PhilipPhilip: what happens if I don't indent under an if statement - will it run that code regardless if the statement is true or false?
16:37  tpratt: PhilipPhilip: If there's nothing indented, then its a syntax error,
16:38  PhilipPhilip: Ah ok! thanks tpratt
16:38  tpratt: (or nothing after the colon on the same line)
16:39  PhilipPhilip: Ah yes, "IndentationError: expected an indented block"
16:44  thevishy: what does this definition mean : cleaner = Cleaner(page_structure=False, links=False
16:44  thevishy: I imported a module called cleaner and this definition is not making much sense to me
16:44  thevishy: Cleaner module to be precie
16:45  thevishy: coming from mainly C++ bg , this doesnt make sense to me
16:45  tpratt: call Cleaner, with some named args, assign whatever it returns to cleaner
16:45  tpratt: assuming there's a ) somewhere
16:45  thevishy: yes there is
16:47  thevishy: and cleaner is an object too
16:47  tpratt: by convention, it looks like Cleaner is a class.
16:48  thevishy: something like initializing an object

17:48  magicblaze007: for some reason, when i execute python from my cygwin bash shell, it hangs...i've to force it to close. Any ideas what might be wrong?
17:48  black_13: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/705/ why am getting TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
17:48  black_13: i have the same code in a 'main' file and it works correctly
17:49  Minty: it's hard to explain :|. I have a logic problem. I need to run several nested loops
17:49  magcius: black_13, first, type(mod) does nothing, remove it
17:49  Minty: the issue is i don't know how many layers / how many nested loops there are
17:50  thevishy: does the attributes available depend on the data structure of the variable ?
17:50  magcius: black_13, second, you're using "dir" in a couple places, one as a variable, the other as a function. Guess what Python can't do :)
17:50  magcius: thevishy, "attributes available"?
17:50  thevishy: functions available - i.e
17:50  black_13: duh'
17:50  magcius: Minty, http://docs.python.org/library/itertools might help you
17:50  black_13: crud i just notice
17:51  magcius: black_13, there's a couple other things wrong with that code as well
17:51  black_13: lay it on me
17:51  magcius: black_13, first, put a try: except: around __import__ -- there's no reason you couldn't come across a broken module
17:52  black_13: totally i was about to do that
17:52  magcius: black_13, second, don't do what you're doing because it might not be right.
17:52  black_13: how is that
17:52  magcius: black_13, use zope.interface
17:52  magcius: I've got things in my modules that I don't want you to use. Ever.
17:52  black_13: isnt zope a web project
17:53  magcius: black_13, no, it's a brand.
17:54  magcius: black_13, there's lots of things called "Zope" that have nothing to do with the Zope server or anything web related
17:54  black_13: i see
17:54  magcius: the "Zope Foundation" was trying to be an Apache-like-thing but for Python instead of Java
17:55  black_13: i want to make a plug-in system for electronic devices
17:55  magcius: but their web server got in the way
17:55  black_13: ah
17:55  black_13: did not know
17:55  magcius: just like "Apache" is mainly a web server, and not a full Java system
17:55  magcius: (apache's httpd is not even written using Java)
17:55  black_13: i have lots of similar electronic devices i communicate to via pyvisaa
17:55  magcius: black_13, zope.interface is useful for creating interfaces
17:56  magcius: you can query for "all of the things that implement things"
17:56  magcius: black_13, see: http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/02/explaining-why-interfaces-are-great.html
18:00  black_13: i will look it up

18:16  thevishy: how do I install libtidy which is a C module ?
18:16  magcius: thevishy, depends on your OS
18:16  thevishy: Windows XP
18:16  thevishy: I dont think I have C in this system
18:16  magcius: thevishy, do you have a C compiler?
18:16  thevishy: No  , C is available actually
18:16  thevishy: C is not available .
18:16  magcius: thevishy, so install one
18:17  magcius: distutils likes MSVC++
18:17  thevishy: right , besides something like HTML Tidy - does it have native Python library ?
18:18  thevishy: Can I install Visual C++ 2010 Express edition ?
18:21  bob2: if you're trying to build a python module, you need the correct version of that
18:27  Minty: I want to do this: http://pastebin.com/PnUbqwGd
18:27  infobob: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/706/ (repasted for Minty)
18:28  bob2: meh
18:28  bob2: itertools.product
18:28  varnie: hi all
18:29  bob2: no idea what the text is about
18:29  Minty: that's what i want do which is easy enough
18:29  Minty: the trouble is, i won't know how many layers of iteration i need
18:29  Minty: i.e, in that case, there are 3 layers because there are 3 blank items
18:29  Minty: but the function may be handed 6 blank items on run time, so how an earth would i go about that?
18:29  bob2: wah
18:30  bob2: this sounds a lot like homework
18:30  bob2: but nonetheless, itertools.product
18:30  Minty: no it absolutely does not lmao
18:30  bob2: + a bit of lateral thinking about the length of the silly list you got passed
18:31  Minty: well, i obviously told you that for simplicity
18:31  bob2: told me what
18:31  Minty: the function doesn't actually return that list but it uses it which is all you need to no
18:31  Minty: no point me complicating it by stating exactly what it does, i need that list that i've said needs to be ouputted
18:31  bob2: uh-huh
18:31  bob2: yeah, you're right
18:32  bob2: your interpretation of the problem you can't solve is plenty sufficient
18:32  Minty: sarcastic much
18:32  bob2: a bit
18:32  Minty: itertools.product looks good
18:32  bob2: perhaps just explain the real problem?
18:32 --- PhilipPhilip is now known as PythonBoy
18:32  Minty: bob2, it's very similar... i need that list
18:32  Minty: i can do the bit "after" i have that list
18:32  bob2: I'm sure it is similar
18:32  Minty: the bit i need help with is getting that list and therefore, that IS the problem
18:32  Minty: similar is a bad word - my bad. it's the foundation of what i need
18:33  Minty: and it is the foundation that i needed help with, not the next bit
18:33  bob2: but this is fairly frustrating way to ask for help
18:33  bob2: ok
18:33  Minty: not at all
18:33  Minty: people need help with problems, not stuff they are capable of doing after they've overcome the problems
18:33  Minty: no?
18:33  Minty: but thank you. itertools.product looks good
18:33  Minty: i'd be interested to see the source code behind that function aswell
18:34  bob2: you're welcome to look at it
18:34  papna: Minty: It's written in C, but there's a pure Python implementation in the documentation.
18:34  bob2: but I would disagree, I'd much rather someone explained heir real problem and asked for help with a subset than asked their interpretation of a subset of the problem
18:34  bob2: which inevitably leads to confusion
18:35  Minty: bob2 - ok
18:35  Minty: you pass my function, *letters - of hangman
18:35  Minty: for example, func("c", "", "", "", "o", "t") - that would be carrot
18:35  Minty: it then finds all possible combinations of that word and returns possible words by comparing to a file of hangman words
18:36  Minty: but function won't know untill run time how many different blank letters there are
18:37  eerne: could anyone give me any hints to create a standalone app using py2app ? i've got some build errors in MachO.py this python and py2app that comes with osx 10.6
18:40  kerio: Minty: can the words contain spaces?
18:40  Minty: bob2: i've done it - thanks for your help, i'm loooking forward to looking at the source code behind that function! that is seriously usefull
18:40  Minty: but i'm getting a stupid error that i can't understand?
18:41  Minty: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307028/
18:41  thevishy: How can I install -> http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree
18:41  thevishy: I am using Python 2.7
18:41  bob2: thevishy: python comes with elementtree
18:41  Minty: how is that an UnboundLocalError when words is globally defined?
18:41  thevishy: I need elementtidy bob2
18:41  bob2: thevishy: if you say so
18:42  papna: Minty: When you do "foo =" inside a function, that makes foo a local for that *whole function*
18:42  bob2: Minty: get_random_word uses it as both a local and a global
18:42  thevishy: is that possible ?
18:42  bob2: Minty: assign to it before reading from it
18:42  Minty: huh?
18:42  bob2: Minty: read the function again
18:42  Minty: it is assigned before it is read
18:42  thevishy: sorry bob2 : I need this - > http://effbot.org/zone/element-tidylib.htm
18:43  bob2: Minty: no it is not
18:43  papna: Minty: You do "words = filter(lambda word: len(word) == length, words)
18:43  tpratt: Minty: read papna's message
18:43  papna: Minty: That means "words" is local.
18:43  papna: Minty: However, you do "for...in enumerate(words):" *before* that, so you haven't yet assigned that local variable.
18:43  Minty: yes but the error is here: for index, item in enumerate(words):
18:43  thevishy: bob2 : I need to install a tree builder module called elementtidy that works on Elementtree
18:43  Minty: the error is way before that
18:43  bob2: thevishy: ok
18:44  Minty: oh wait, this is run time
18:44  bob2: Minty: because the local variable words is not defined
18:44  Minty: because i assign it, that is added as a local variable in a look up table at compile time right?
18:44  papna: Minty: In Python, everything interesting happens at runtime.
18:44  papna: Minty: When you call that function, it executes that line.
18:44  Minty: which is whey the error at run time is deceptive (to me) right?
18:44  papna: Minty: Words is a local variable
18:44  papna: Minty: *words
18:44  papna: Minty: So when it looks it up, it finds you haven't done "words =" in that function yet.
18:45  thevishy: I downloaded the source from http://effbot.org/media/downloads/elementtidy-1.0-20050212.zip , how do I go about installing this ?
18:45  Minty: yes but it's defined globally
18:45  Minty: so how can it not exist?
18:45  papna: Minty: Because, in that funcion, words *IS* a local variable.
18:45  papna: Minty: For the whole function.
18:45  kerio: you assign to "words"
18:45  papna: Minty: PERIOD.
18:45  papna: Minty: That's how Python works.
18:45  kerio: you want it to be global, stick a "global words" at the beginning of the function
18:45  kerio: but really
18:45  kerio: find a better way
18:46  papna: Minty: If you don't want to change the global "words", http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307029/
18:47  papna: Minty: If you DO want to, revise your code to use a class rather than a global.
18:48  Minty: thanks
18:48  Minty: is my understanding now correct: when that function is compiled, it sees words and therefore, that label will be added to the look-up-table for that function is a LOCAL variable to that function and therefore, at run-time, when words is called, it ignores the global because the label is stored as local, not global ?
18:52  thevishy: how do I know what VC version or C version is required for a particular Module
18:52  thevishy: it is a wrapper module basically
18:53  Minty: Easiest code to convert ["c", "", "", "", "o", "t"] and ("a", "r", "r") into ["c", "a", "r", "r", "o", "t"] ?
18:53  Minty: sry being lazy :P
18:59  kurol: ["c", "", "", "", "o", "t"][1:4] = ("a", "r", "r") works for me
18:59  Minty: ffs another error that i can't make sense of :(
18:59  Minty: kurol: i won't know the indexes
18:59  Minty: i'll have a list with a certain number of blanks in certain places
19:00  Minty: and combinations to fit those blanks (won't necessarily be next to each other) but i managed it in an easy-ish wy
19:00  Minty: way
19:00  kerio: kurol: ARRRRRRRRRR
19:00  Minty: letters_copy[letters_copy.index("")] = letter
19:00  Minty: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
19:00  Minty: think is.... letters_copy is a list, not a tuple
19:00  Minty: so i dno what it's on about
19:01  Minty: well it is a tuple obviously, but not sure why
19:01  thevishy: How can I install the ewquired C version anyone ?
19:01  thevishy: also how does Python understand that I have installed one - Windows XP is the OS
19:03  teratorn: say *what*?
19:03  tpratt: required?
19:03  Minty: papna: where can i find the python implemented version of itertools?
19:03  teratorn: thevishy: you're trying to compile something? a python package?
19:05  thevishy: I am trying to load this module called elementtidy , but it needs some c libraries installed
19:05  teratorn: thevishy: what is the exact error?
19:05  teratorn: paste.pocoo.org
19:05  thevishy: If I am trying to instll the module using python setup.py install I get - > error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat
19:06  thevishy: I googled and found that it coule be because of vc missing , but what VC do I install ?
19:08  teratorn: thevishy: so you're trying to install a python package that contains C extensions
19:08  teratorn: thevishy: possibly this: http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP
19:08  teratorn: thevishy: or you might have luck with mingw32
19:08  Minty: .readlines() returns items with "\n" on the end
19:08  NelleV: mingw32 is better in my experience
19:08  Minty: is there an easy way to remove those than iterating through every element of the list and stripping it?
19:08  teratorn: the former is probably easier to make *just work* as distutils ought to automagically locate the vcvarsall.bat and you will be good to go
19:09  teratorn: I'm not sure what the concerns are about building C extensions with a different compiler than the one used to build Python... (?)
19:10  bob2: Minty: don't use .readlines
19:10  Minty: what would you do?
19:10  teratorn: NelleV: how do you go about setting that up?
19:10  thevishy: ming32 would Help I think
19:10  bob2: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307041/
19:10  cnf: bob2: don't tell people not to do something
19:11  bob2: cnf: siryessir
19:11  cnf: well, not without offering an alternative :P
19:11  bob2: OK
19:11  bob2: OVER
19:11  teratorn: cnf: out job in #python is basically to tell people what not to do all day long
19:11  Minty: he offered an alternative...
19:11  teratorn: s/out/our/
19:11  Minty: bob2: isn't that basically what readlines does...
19:11  bob2: Minty: no
19:11  bob2: .readlines() is only useful if you need a list of the lines
19:11  bob2: which is rarely needed
19:12  kerio: cnf: the alternative is reading the python tutorial
19:12  Minty: bob2 rofl
19:12  bob2: does the tutorial cover iterating over files?
19:12  cnf: kerio: lame
19:12  bob2: Minty: mind the rules
19:12  Minty: that is exactly what i need! just without the \n
19:12  bob2: Minty: and I'm not sure how that is funny
19:12  Minty: cus that's what i said
19:13  bob2: I'm not sure where you mentioned your requirements
19:13  Minty: fair enough
19:13  Minty: cheers for help
19:13  brian: That guy wasn't very sharp.
19:19  Minty: does anyone know where i can find the python implementation of itertools? i can't find it anywhere and am seriously interested to look at the code for it!
19:20  bob2: http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html
19:21  thevishy: i installed ming32 but still get the error - do I have to do some additional configs
19:21  teratorn: Minty: it's a "built in" module
19:22  teratorn: Minty: meaning its written in C in some corner of the Python code somewhere
19:22  Minty: yes but there has been a python implementation
19:22  bob2: however the docs have python implementations of most of it
19:22  Minty: hence why i asked where i can find the python implementation of it
19:22  bob2: hence papna and i linking to it
19:22  lvh: Minty: It usally provides equivalents in Python in the docs
19:22  Minty: oh, i didn't see the link?
19:23  Minty: lvh: of the source code? really?
19:23  bob2: for itertools, yes
19:23  Minty: bob2, on the docs
19:23  Minty: where is the source code? looking at it now and cannot se.
19:23  Minty: see
19:24  bob2: then look again
19:24  Minty: ty
19:31  marel: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307057/ Why am I getting this error ?
19:31  kerio: because ints are not iterable
19:31  kerio: it says that right there
19:32  marel: what does that mean?
19:33  bob2: it means yo ucan't iterate over ints
19:33  kerio: it's not a sequence, a container, or a generator yielding multiple values
19:33  bob2: if you meant to iterate over a range of numbers, you might want xrange
19:33  kerio: it's a number
19:33  bob2: but in this case you don't
19:34  marel: how can i fix this ?
19:34  kerio: what is x?
19:34  bob2: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307061/
19:35  marel: x is a string
19:35  lukoko: How to assert with unittest that type is correct? I try http://paste.pound-python.org/show/707/ but that does not work.
19:35  bob2: lukoko: normally you don't, but isinstance()
19:36  bob2: lukoko: btw your classes should usually be ne style
19:36  bob2: er new style
19:37  lukoko: what is new style?
19:37  bob2: inherit from object instead of nothing
19:37  varnie: class Foo(object):
19:38  lvh: __metaclass__ = type ftw.
19:40  kerio: lvh: wait, what
19:43  lukoko: One more question about unittest: Is there such an assertion "assertTrue"?
19:43  bob2: sure
19:43  lukoko: Or should i use built-in assert?
19:43  marel: How do I remove \n's from a multi-line string ?
19:43  bob2: no
19:43  bob2: marel: .replace
19:44  bob2: but depending on what you're doing, there might be a simpler solution
19:44  bob2: (assert_, failUnless)
19:45  lvh: kerio: ?
19:45  lvh: kerio: What do you think that does.
19:45  lvh: kerio: Do you understand  what a __metaclass__ in module namespace does
19:45  marel: bob2, I basically have multi line string like '''2234\n234234...23423''' and I want a string without \n's, like '2234234234..23423'..
19:46  lvh: marel: I already gave you a way to do that.
19:46  kerio: lvh: hmm... every class becomes a new-style class?
19:46  kerio: cool
19:46  lvh: marel: You told me that what you wanted was [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]
19:47  lvh: marel: In which case: [int(c) for c in s if c.isdigit()]
19:47  marel: lvh, yeah I thought that was what I wanted too, but I need just a string without \n's, not a list
19:47  lvh: marel: Why one and not the other?
19:48  lvh: marel: Why are you doing this anyway? What's the end goal?
19:49  marel: lvh, well basically I'm doing euler problem 13(http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=13) and I want to get a sum all 150 digit numbers in that multiline string..
19:53  lvh: marel: Then why would you want to remove newlines? Sounds much more like you want str(sum(map(int, s.split())))[10:]
19:54  marel: lvh, I have figured out a way how to get that sum if I have a single line string, without \n's. What does that command do ?
19:54  Zilly: What would be the best way to add source code to an object and edit that files source within python?  Would it be to just attach whatever code you want to the object and then inspect it to get the source and rewrite the source file?
20:01  varnie: marel, it do exactly what you want to achieve.
20:02  balaa: how can i use range and left pad zero's to every number less than 10
20:03  balaa: ie instead of [1,2,3] i would like[01,02,03]
20:03  bahamas: balaa: you'd have to turn them into strings
20:03  bahamas: why do you want that?
20:04  balaa: im trying to write a list comprehension to get all objects created for each day of the month
20:04  balaa: [ len(StorePurchase.objects.filter(created__contains='2010-12-'+str(x))) for x in range(1,20)]
20:06  balaa: but a datetime objects str is 12-12-01 <- has a zero for all days before the 10th
20:06  bob2: 'string formatting'
20:06  bob2: also you might like the calendar module
20:07  balaa: bob2: thanks
20:07  black_13: how do i dynamically load a class __import__
20:09  bahamas: balaa: ['2010-12-%s' % str(i).zfill(2) for i in xrange(20)] is one way to do it
20:09  AbortedF: balaa: "2010-12-%02d" % str(x) should work
20:10  balaa: thanks guys
20:10  AbortedF: bahamas: touche :)
20:10  bahamas: AbortedF: %d requires a number
20:11  AbortedF: whoops. Good point. remove the str() part :)
20:11  bahamas: for some reason, it didn't work the first time i tried it. balaa use AbortedF's solutions. it's clearer

20:45  18VABX585: hi guys
20:45  18VABX585: i want to get the absolute value squared of a list of numbers using map
20:46  18VABX585: i can do sq = map(abs, list)
20:46  18VABX585: but that only gives me the absolute value
20:46  18VABX585: can i also square them in the same map command?
20:46  hopthrisC: sq = map(abs, list)**2 ?
20:47  18VABX585: sq = map(pow(abs,2), list)?
20:47  18VABX585: or with lambda
20:47  hopthrisC: what's the absolute value of a list of numbers anyway, and why do you want it squared and ot the numbers in the list
20:47  hopthrisC: also, don't use map, use a list comprehension
20:48  kerio: 18VABX585: the square root of what
20:48  kerio: you have a list of numbers and you want...?
20:48  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: sq = map(pow(abs,2), list) can't ever work
20:48  18VABX585: hopthrisC: for physical reasons. its a list of complex numbers
20:48  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: what i meant was: you probably had your question completely wrong
20:48  18VABX585: hopthrisC: why list comprehension? whats wrong with mapping a lambda function?
20:49  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: it's considered less elegant nowadays
20:49  18VABX585: hopthrisC: so whats the elegant way of writing it?
20:49  18VABX585: btw a**2 doesnt work if a is a list
20:49  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: first, what do you really want?
20:49  An_Ony_Moose: What would be the easiest way to write midi files in python? I've googled and found quite a lot of libraries but they mostly seem to be a bit complex to use and aren't very well documented.
20:49  kerio: math.sqrt(abs(x)) for x in your_list
20:50  18VABX585: no, pow(sqrt(abs(x),2)) for x in list
20:50  hopthrisC: kerio: squared, not square root
20:50  18VABX585: hopthrisC, kerio thanks!
20:50  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: sq = [abs(i)**2 for i in list]
20:50  kerio: wait, what
20:51  papna: hopthrisC: i ** 2
20:51  hopthrisC: papna: huh?
20:51  papna: pantsman: Or abs(i) ** 0.5 or something.
20:51  hopthrisC: 18VABX585: next time mention that the numbers are complex, because the abs() makes no sense, otherwise
20:51  18VABX585: hopthrisC: sorry, my bad!
21:02  An_Ony_Moose: does anyone know a well-documented python module that can create midi files?

21:21  lvh: An_Ony_Moose: Didn't say it was pretty.
21:21  kerio: Fuco: not to mention a good middle language!
21:21  Fuco: and he might enjoy this
21:21  Fuco: hehe
21:21  Fuco: well I was thinking about java as well, but there's a bit too much boilerplate to start
21:21  kerio: not to mention it's a crappy language
21:21  Fuco: and explaining it in therms "just do this because it's so" is quite wrong approach I think
21:22  kerio: if your father is into math you could also try haskell
21:22  lvh: Fuco: Math is full of it.
21:22  Fuco: yea, I was thinking about haskell too
21:22  lvh: (Double entendres and intentional ambiguous antecedents, yay!)
21:22  Fuco: but it's not so trivial to write something useful with it
21:22  kerio: although python has scipy/numpy/mpl
21:22  lvh: Math is pretty impossibly wide nowadays
21:23  An_Ony_Moose: lvh: oh well, thanks :P

21:30  kerio: lvh: what about struct.pack
21:30  kerio: if he needs a number in bytes form, he probably wants some form of struct

21:33  kerio: q is a 64-bit int

21:36  black_13: how do you determine if a type is a class type?
21:36  lvh: Basically make sure that you couldn't be on EFNET without someone noticing.
21:36  lvh: black_13: Why do you need to
21:37  lvh: black_13: Python is a duck typed language, you typically do not care about the position of any object's type in a particular inheritance lattice.
21:37  cnf: also lvh shout i mention from now on i don't know what i'm talking about? ^6;
21:37  papna: black_13: You don't.
21:37  black_13: i am dynamically loading a module and the pulling everything out of module and then using that class
21:37  _habnabit: black_13, what does that even mean
21:37  black_13: i get ducktypeing
21:37  cnf: should*
21:38  _habnabit: black_13, make your module have an attribute that contains all of the classes that are relevant.
21:38  black_13: i want to load a module/class at run time and use it duckishly
21:38  kerio: black_13: that's not duck typing, that's ridiculous
21:38  kerio: if you want a plugin system there are plenty already
21:38  lvh: black_13: Okay, so why do you need to check if something is a class?
21:38  _habnabit: black_13, no need to try to scrape all of the classes out of the module.
21:38  kerio: *good* plugin systems
21:40  papna: black_13: Rather than typechecking, have the thing have a specific name, or call a function with the objects you want to register, or do it by inheritance or interface implementation.
21:40  black_13: _habnabit, and i just wanted to know just to know
21:40  _habnabit: black_13, it's not a useful thing to know.

21:50  Eblis: hi
21:50  Eblis: i have 2 integer numbers, the integer part and the decimal part of a floating number, how do i convert it to a float ?
21:51  _habnabit: +
21:51  VooDooNOFX: add em together
21:51  Eblis: aha
21:51  VooDooNOFX: 2 + .443 = float
21:51  Eblis: the decimal is still expressed as an integer ?
21:51  VooDooNOFX: though, to be clear, you don't have 2 integers
21:52  Eblis: so if i have 200.99, integer = 200, decimal == 99
21:52  _habnabit: Eblis, where do those numbers come from?
21:52  Eblis: regex parsing from a text
21:52  _habnabit: ...
21:52  Eblis: -1799,<sup class="money-decimal">99</sup> Lei\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t
21:52  VooDooNOFX: if you have, say, int1 = 200, and int2 = 99, then the math is a littl different
21:52  Eblis: like this
21:52  _habnabit: Eblis, why don't you tokenize a float as one token in... aaaaaaaa
21:53  _habnabit: Eblis, don't use regexps on HTML.
21:53  VooDooNOFX: beautifulsoup could parse that really easily
21:53  VooDooNOFX: but, to make that a -1799.99 again, it's easy

22:08  _habnabit: bahamas, I still haven't been able to reproduce it.

22:12  bahamas: _habnabit: i'm not restricted to mysql, so i think i will do that
22:12  HavokDelta6: Tanner - heard of Regex?
22:12  tanner: HavokDelta6: yes, which is what this is for
22:12  HavokDelta6: Tanner - i could give you a crash course if you like
22:12  _habnabit: bahamas, yaaaaay

22:14  _habnabit: HavokDelta6, 'use it' ?
22:14  HavokDelta6: on windows, its double click a .py file. on ubuntu - its not
22:14  _habnabit: tanner, why are you /generating/ regexps, anyway?

22:17  Godslastering: I'm having trouble calling threading.Thread(target=self.somefunc).start()... it is telling me that the instance of this class has no attribute myfunc, but it does have a function named that
22:17 --- mikemac is now known as crazymykl
22:17  _habnabit: Godslastering, python is trying to stop you from using threading, obviously. It's rarely a good idea.
22:18  Godslastering: _habnabit: ok well its a simple client-server, the communication is automated, but i'd like to provide a way to, during debug, have the user provide a string to send
22:18  Godslastering: _habnabit: so i'm starting a thread to listen on the side, sending whatever is entered, while the main loop keeps running
22:18  _habnabit: Godslastering, what part of that requires threads?
22:19  Godslastering: _habnabit: how can i keep it from pausing waiting for input?
22:19  _habnabit: Godslastering, well, tell your mainloop to wait for input.
22:19  _habnabit: Godslastering, it won't block the mainloop, but it'll poll to see if there's any.
22:19  Godslastering: _habnabit: and how would this be done?
22:20  _habnabit: Godslastering, well, depends on your mainloop.
22:20  VooDooNOFX: to automagically round each element within an array?
22:20  Godslastering: _habnabit: i'm currently using twisted's SSLFactory setup and the "main loop" is the dataReceived function
22:21  HavokDelta6: i've sorted tanner out now, its good
22:21  _habnabit: HavokDelta6, please don't take questions off-channel.
22:21  _habnabit: HavokDelta6, keep it on-channel.
22:21  _habnabit: Godslastering, and you're trying to use stdio, right?
22:22  Godslastering: _habnabit: i was not with threading, no. should i be?
22:22  HavokDelta6: so when one compiles python, what happens to it then? i mean, how do i set it as the default program, where does it install to.
22:22  _habnabit: HavokDelta6, it installs wherever you told it to install.
22:22  HavokDelta6: which is?
22:22  HavokDelta6: make install....is hardly suggestive.
22:22  _habnabit: Godslastering, okay, for starters, threading is not necessary here. Twisted alleviates that.
22:23  Godslastering: _habnabit: ok, i was unaware that Twisted made this situation simpler, so how should i proceed
22:23  _habnabit: Godslastering, I'm unclear on what problem you're having; at first, it seemed like you were trying to read from stdio, but now you're saying no.

22:25  Godslastering: _habnabit: threading-ly i was using raw_input, but i guess i can use stio, yes (its technically through the system's stio anyways)
22:25  _habnabit: Godslastering, raw_input reads from stdio.
22:25  armence: HavokDelta6, Put it in your PATH
22:25  HavokDelta6: Rajko, len(array thing)
22:26  HavokDelta6: armence, my what?
22:26  Godslastering: HavokDelta6:
22:26  _habnabit: Godslastering, anyway, twisted.internet.stdio
22:26  Godslastering: woops
22:26  _habnabit: Godslastering, that's all you need.
22:26  Pwnna: is there a message box class, or something similar to it in python that shows a message box without all the libraries and stuff?
22:26  cmouse: i'm getting strange error when I try to recode some cp1251 text into unicode
22:26  cmouse: but i get the error on print phase
22:26  armence: HavokDelta6, I assume you're on a *nix box. Is that correct?
22:26  Rajko: HavokDelta6, does indexing start at 0 or 1
22:26  _habnabit: Pwnna, no.
22:26  HavokDelta6: Rajko, at 0
22:26  Pwnna: damnit
22:26  Pwnna: =\
22:26  cmouse: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character u'\u0410' in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
22:27  _habnabit: 13:25:19 < _habnabit> Rajko, docs.python.org/tut
22:27  HavokDelta6: Rajko, len(thing) = 0 means thing is empty, its not lua :P
22:27  cmouse: any ideas how to fix this?
22:27  lvh: Pwnna: If you want that, you want urwid.
22:27  _habnabit: Rajko, these are very basic questions covered in any tutorial.
22:27  HavokDelta6: armence, yes
22:27  lvh: Pwnna: You should probably get rid of your fear of libraries. It's counterproductive.
22:27  Rajko: _habnabit, im just hacking a script quick, dont need a tutorial
22:27  armence: HavokDelta6, type: echo $PATH
22:27  _habnabit: cmouse, unicode isn't an encoding.
22:27  cmouse: _habnabit: ah
22:27  _habnabit: Rajko, apparently you do, if you're asking questions like this.
22:27  Pwnna: lvh: the tool i'm creating only need to display a msg box upon success or failure
22:27  Pwnna: lvh: all configurations are from file.
22:28  Pwnna: all logging are to file
22:28  Scorchin: anyone know of any decent Python codebreaking libs?
22:28  _habnabit: cmouse, anyway, the error is pretty clear.
22:28  cmouse: _habnabit: well, i am doing var = unicode(tag[2:32],"cp1251") and then print var, and the print fails
22:28  Pwnna: oh well
22:28  Godslastering: _habnabit: and how is this initiated, by "protocol" i can pass it the Factory, or what? :S
22:28  _habnabit: cmouse, yeah, don't use the two-argument form of unicode.
22:28  Pwnna: anyone familiar with the win32 registry and context menu?
22:28  _habnabit: cmouse, `var = tag[2:32].decode('cp1251')`
22:29  Pwnna: explorer context menu*
22:29  cmouse: _habnabit: hm
22:29  _habnabit: cmouse, and when you try to print it, python tries to use your terminal's encoding.
22:29  _habnabit: cmouse, which, apparently, can't encode all of the code points in the string.
22:29  cmouse: _habnabit: ok.. that's probably the problem
22:29  armence: HavokDelta6, All of these directories are places where your shell will search for commands you type. So for instance, if you make your program "foo" executable and put it in one of those paths, typing "foo" on the cli will execute that command
22:29  cmouse: have to figure out how to get utf8 terminal on windows, then
22:30  _habnabit: Godslastering, you just instantiate a StandardIO object with a Protocol object as the first argument.
22:30  _habnabit: Godslastering, then you get any input from stdin as dataReceived.
22:30  HavokDelta6: armence, so foo.py with the premissions of being executionable means that foo in the CLI will call it?
22:30  armence: no, foo.py will call it
22:35  HavokDelta6: i'm just about to do make install on python, where will it install do - how can i find it on the filesystem
22:36  _habnabit: Depends on what you put into ./configure
22:36  HavokDelta6: is that a file?
22:36  matrix: i need a library like msdn
22:36  matrix: does python have it ?
22:36  _habnabit: HavokDelta6, you... ran it.
22:36  _habnabit: matrix, what does taht mean
22:37  matrix: do you know msdn library
22:37  _habnabit: Yes.
22:38  kerio: HavokDelta6: why are you installing it from the tarball
22:38  kerio: don't you have a package manager
22:39  HavokDelta6: kerio, gotta learn at some point
22:39  _habnabit: You do?
22:40  HavokDelta6: that config file....doesnt seem to contain an absolute file reference.
22:40  HavokDelta6: where might i find it?
22:40  _habnabit: :T
22:40  HavokDelta6: infact why isn't it defined by an argument
22:41  _habnabit: Surprise! It is. That's what I've been talking about the whole time.
22:43  cmouse: uhm
22:43  cmouse: why do i receive IOError errno=13 after print? =)
22:43  cmouse: it is the last line in the code
22:43  _habnabit: Who knows?
22:43  cmouse: i don't
22:43  _habnabit: Also, errnos don't mean anything.
22:44  cmouse: it says 'Permission denied'
22:45  cmouse: print u'{0}'.format(value) causes IOError
22:45  chkdsk: Question. I want to store a list of users and points. How can I store them easily, and search through them to get the right record in a decent amount of time? (The list could well grow into the hundreds)
22:45  _habnabit: chkdsk, sqlite3
22:46  chkdsk: I've never used sqlite3, does it require installation on the host machine?
22:46  lvh: chkdsk: No.
22:46  _habnabit: No.
22:46  lvh: chkdsk: It's a library that puts a database into a file. All you need is the library.
22:47  chkdsk: Is it a native python library?
22:47  lvh: chkdsk: The bindings are mostly Python, SQLite itself is implemented in C.
22:48  chkdsk: I mean, is it included by default?
22:48  lvh: chkdsk: If you care about that, your deployment/distribution/installation system is outdated or nonexistent.
22:49  lvh: chkdsk: (It is, but that _really_ shouldn't matter.)
22:49  chkdsk: It matters because we're going to be testing on multiple platforms, and not all libraries outside the built-ins are available on multiple platforms.
22:49  magicblaze007: if i'm writing two modules that have a lot of import's that are the same, is there a way not to repeat this code?
22:49  aberceanu: papna_: is this what you meant by mormon porn --> http://www.examiner.com/trendy-living-in-national/bubbles-turn-innocent-pictures-into-mormon-porn
22:49  _habnabit: matrix, no.
22:49 * _habnabit kicks irssi.
22:49  _habnabit: magicblaze007, no.
22:49  lvh: chkdsk: I test on multiple platforms, too!
22:50  lvh: chkdsk: It is extremely unlikely that you can find a platform SQLite doesn't run on.
22:50  magicblaze007: _habnabit: I'm using clonedigger and it complains about import copying...Should I worry about it? Is there a way to tell clonedigger to not report import copies?
22:50  lvh: chkdsk: It's a builtin module, but like so many builtin modules, it can be turned off. That's why you shouldn't care.
22:50  _habnabit: magicblaze007, I have no idea what that is.
22:51  magicblaze007: _habnabit: a tool to find code duplication ...
22:51  _habnabit: magicblaze007, sounds like it has no concept of code semantics.
22:52  lvh: chkdsk: I can understand why the language would matter, but I don't understand why what's built in and what's not would matter.
22:52  lvh: chkdsk: If it can't be made to work as a third party thing, it can't be made to work as a builtin module either: they're just installed into a different spot, but they're otherwise identical.
22:53  cmouse: *sigh*
22:53  magicblaze007: _habnabit: but it sounds a bit wierd to cut and paste the same import statements in every module ... especially if they have a common parent...like myproject.module.prog* should at least be able to import common things with prog*...
22:53  cmouse: that IOError is a bug that others have had too
22:53  cmouse: it's related to some really strange stuff
22:53  magicblaze007: or maybe I'm dreaming in C code still? Not sure why python doesnt allow this...
22:53  lvh: chkdsk: In fact: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlite/ . That's exactly the same module (but typically a more recent version).
22:53  _habnabit: magicblaze007, you're forgetting the zen of python.
22:54  magicblaze007: Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! ?
22:54  _habnabit: magicblaze007, explicit is better than implicit.
22:54  lvh: magicblaze007: Explicit...
22:54  lvh: _habnabit: :(
22:55  magicblaze007: :) Thanks

23:05  marel: How do I remove element [i] from a list L ?
23:06  _habnabit: list.remove
23:09  kerio: _habnabit: what?
23:09  kerio: del L[i]
23:09  magicblaze007: marel: del L[i]
23:09  _habnabit: Not L.remove([i]) ?
23:09  kerio: i assume i is the index
23:10  marel: Yes, i is the index.
23:10  magicblaze007: _habnabit: L.remove(i) removes element with value i, right?
23:10  kerio: you could also do L.remove(L[i]) but it's probably redundant - and it will fail if there are more occurrences of L[i] in the list

23:14  bobng: Hello. A while ago I found an awesome library called "Axiom", which was part of a project called "Divmod". It was a wrapper of Sqlite and looked pretty neat
23:15  bobng: The site has been down for a couple of days now, and when i used it it had not been updated for a while (supported up to 2.4)
23:15  bobng: Is anyone here involved with the project?
23:15  _habnabit: Divmod is the guys who did twisted.
23:16  bobng: Hmm, well I wouldn't mind putting the code up on a google code project, after making it support python 2.5
23:17  bobng: wouldn't take much, the only issue was it using pysqlite or some other 3rd party library instead of sqlite3
23:18  magicblaze007: bobng: what is divmod for?
23:18  marel: Is there any easy way to generate a list of integers from a to b ?
23:18  bobng: marel: range(x,y)
23:18  kerio: wait, what
23:19  bobng: magicblaze007: No idea, the site is down and I haven't seen it in a while. It was a few loosely related projects I think
23:19 * forrestv can't remember the last time he used range (as opposed to xrange)
23:19  magicblaze007: ah k
23:19  bobng: Oh, it seems to be complementary libraries for twisted magicblaze007
23:19  marel: bobng, if I'm using range(x,y) I still have to write a for loop, isn't there an easier way ?
23:20  kerio: marel: ooh, python 3?
23:20  bobng: why would you need to marel?
23:20  kerio: list(range(x, y))
23:20  kerio: and you don't need a for loop
23:20  kerio: you need to iterate over it
23:20  kerio: the easiest way is with a for loop, yeah
23:20  marel: kerio, 2.6
23:20  marel: well okay
23:20  bobng: I don't think you do need to on 2.6
23:21  bobng: I might be wrong, but I think there is still a difference between range and xrange on 2.6
23:21  kerio: yup
23:21  forrestv: bobng, the channel for that is #twisted-web
23:21  kerio: range() on python2 returns a list
23:21  forrestv: err, #twisted.web
23:22  bobng: well then marel range(x) creates a list of integers, no need for a loop
