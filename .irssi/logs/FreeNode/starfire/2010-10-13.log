23:06 --- Query: Starting query with Starfire on FreeNode
23:06 iaj: hey there
23:06 iaj: you around?
23:08 Starfire: Yeah.
23:10 iaj: I got a question...
23:10 iaj: java.lang.RuntimeException: Required setting 'org.eclim.java.run.mainclass' has not been set.
23:10 iaj: Can you maybe tell me what I need to do for that?
23:11 Starfire: I don't know, I've only used CDT (Eclipse for C/C++).
23:11 iaj: Hmmm alirhgt.. is the Keybinding for completition C-X C-U as well?
23:12 Starfire: Yes, although I've rebound it to C-N
23:12 iaj: Omg.. I got to hit :Java % :D
23:12 iaj: Im so stupid.
23:13 iaj: Hmmm what does that keybinding looklike?
23:13 Starfire: inoremap <C-N> ^X^U
23:14 Starfire: But you need to input ^X^U like ctrl-v, ctrl-x, ctrl-v, ctrl-u
23:14 Starfire: So vim inserts literal control characters.
23:16 iaj: Ahww thanks your right :)
23:17 Starfire: I also rebound normal mode K to do :CSearchContext, I suspect there's a similar command for Java.
23:19 iaj: What's that one doing?
23:20 iaj: Oh....
23:20 iaj: Its just sooooo awesome
23:22 Starfire: Instant jump to symbol.
23:22 Starfire: Or rather "slow, but handy jump to symbol" :)
23:22 iaj: to symbol - what does that mean?
23:22 iaj: Got an example for it?
23:23 Starfire: Place cursor over a type (like boost::scoped_ptr), press K, eclim opens the source code for that type in a split window.
23:23 Starfire: In Java, there's probably something that you can use to jump to class or method source code.
23:24 iaj: Really such stuff is working?
23:24 iaj: Amazing.
23:26 Starfire: Check eclim documentation.
23:27 Starfire: Off to sleep now, bye!
23:30 iaj: Heh
23:30 iaj: Yeah I will do !
23:30 iaj: Thanks !
