11:59 --- Query: Starting query with biesior on FreeNode
11:59 iaj: heyhey:)
11:59 iaj: thanks for the hlep
12:00 biesior: you're welcome ;]
12:00 iaj: checked it out..  where do I have to place that /kickstarter folder now.. typo3ext/ ?
12:01 biesior: yes, and after that you need to login into BE, and install the extension via Extension manager
12:01 biesior: ech
12:01 biesior: sorry typo3conf/ext/ of course
12:03 iaj: alright, thanks :)
12:03 iaj: is it difficult?
12:03 biesior: and make sure that's NOT placed in trunk subdirectory
12:03 iaj: just grabbed it and now uploading via ftp to typo3conf/ext
12:04 biesior: you will waste some time for starting with kickstarter on the other hand - small plugins are sometimes the best option for advanced tasks...
12:05 biesior: after some days you will create such things in 5 minutes (it's still faster then learning and rebuilding working site for TV)
12:06 biesior: there's excelent ebook from Dmitry Dulepov conerned on ext dev basics: TYPO3 extension development
12:06 biesior: and it helped me not a once
12:08 iaj: uuuhh thanks :) sorry just had a lot of work going on
12:08 iaj: yeah, i find myself in a state where i could just need a small extension to get set up :\
12:09 biesior: remember one thing: kickstarter IS NOT an editor - if you'll change something in kickstarter and will save the whole output - whole your manual code will gone! beware!
12:09 iaj: ahhh that's nice to know as well
12:09 iaj: do you have a link to that ebook from Dmitry Dulepov?
12:10 biesior: ok, I've to back to work, good luck :) think about the book :)
12:13 iaj: thaaaanks

13:37 iaj: you still around?
13:39 biesior: hej
13:41 iaj: http://www.amazon.de/Typo3-Extension-Development-Dmitry-Dulepov/dp/1847192122/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books-intl-de&qid=1293539729&sr=8-2
13:41 iaj: is that it?
13:41 iaj: :-)
13:42 biesior: I don't understand German, is that paper book or ebook ?
13:42 biesior: (yes that's the title I was talking about)
13:42 iaj: paper book
13:43 iaj: i just mean is it the book you ment :)
13:43 iaj: https://www.packtpub.com/typo3-extension-development/book
13:43 iaj: oO
13:43 biesior: IMHO it makes no sense to buy paper book - it's better to buy eBook (it's much cheaper) and print it youself, what's more you can copy-paste text from PDF into your IDE 
13:46 biesior: :) by default this is price for multiformat (paper+pdf) - however you can buy PDF only for € 19.59 - and imho that's good price for this knowledge
13:50 iaj: hmm yeh... alright I just ordered it... lets see how many days it takes until it gets here
13:50 biesior: paper?

13:59 iaj: naah, pdf
13:59 iaj: you are right
13:59 iaj: I couldn't copy paste it then
13:59 iaj: which IDE do you use anyway?
13:59 iaj: =)

14:05 biesior: a propos paper vs. pdf -> pdf is cheaper, you can copy-paste and what's most important you can download it right now after purchasing (and at last you can also print it on the paper after all)
14:06 biesior: currently I'm testing phpStorm 
14:06 biesior: and netbeans (which is free and very nice)
14:10 iaj: oh i could've sworn i got a vimmer in front of me here:)
14:10 iaj: yeah, i like netbeans as well
14:10 iaj: never heard of phpstorm
14:13 biesior: bleh - I don't like plain text "IDE's" I love auto-completing, API scanning, etc, etc... - just when yousing advanced staff I haven't to care about syntax...
14:13 biesior: phpstorm is new soft, it's paid, however very nice, imho much nicer then NB (which I like too)
14:14 iaj: haha... well yeah but you can set up VIM soooo to work into one's hands
14:14 iaj: even autocompletion

14:40 iaj: ;-)
14:40 iaj: do you have an example for an export php script?  or shoould I make one from scrath
14:40 iaj: scratch
14:43 biesior: I saw some examples in typo3 source... first test if you can execute a system(); function for your PHP script
14:45 biesior: for an example send some zip via FTP to your server and try to decompress it with:
14:45 biesior: <?php system('unzip mypack.zip');

15:00 biesior: ( i was pinged out :/)
15:01 iaj: huh... alright
15:01 iaj: gimem a sec
15:01 iaj: im gonna try :)
15:01 iaj: thanks ツ
15:05 biesior: there are examples of backing up from command line at the beginning, use them in your PHP's system(); - remember to give the password in your script to DB as it won't ask you via browser's window
15:10 iaj: 14:45:30  biesior: <?php system('unzip mypack.zip');
15:10 iaj: 15:00:21  biesior: typo3/sysext/lowlevel/HOWTO_clean_up_TYPO3_installations.txt
15:10 iaj: 15:00:42  biesior: ( i was pinged out :/)
15:10 iaj: hmmm
15:10 iaj: ahw.
15:11 biesior: ??
15:12 iaj: should it cry if the file doesn't exist?
15:13 biesior: which file ? HOWTO ?
15:13 iaj: Archive: foo.zip 
15:13 iaj: that's what I see...
15:14 iaj: but it didn't unzip my file
15:14 iaj: :[
15:14 biesior: so probably system() is not allowed :/ really think about changing the provider
