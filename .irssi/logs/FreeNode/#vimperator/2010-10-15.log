12:31  Segaja: now and than :)
12:31  Segaja: how can we help you?
12:34  dpb: gamefreak264: he's here even now, idle though.
12:34  gamefreak264: I don't need any help, I was just curious
12:34  gamefreak264: not at the moment, anyway
12:35  gamefreak264: I didn't get the impression that the Vimperator team was very active these days

18:43  maxauthority: anekos: yeah
18:43  anekos: ひ
18:43  anekos: ooops
18:43  anekos: hi
18:43  maxauthority: :)
18:43  maxauthority: hi
18:44  anekos: I want to make the organization on github for plugin repository.
18:44  Segaja: maxauthority: i hope todays nightly of FF fixes the problem
18:44  Segaja: if not someone hast to look at the code again
18:44  anekos: Can I name "vimperator" to the organization?
18:46  anekos: I want not to commit to coderepos, so I need other repository.
18:47  maxauthority: anekos: we can do it, but if you want, we can make a plugins/ directory on vimperator-labs google code
18:47  anekos: hmmmmmm
18:49  anekos: it's in vimp's soruce code repository?
18:50  anekos: (and I want to use git, google should supports git...)
18:52  maxauthority: yeah, in vimp's source repository, would be cool to have plugins there. especially since i think some seldom used features should be plugins anyway
18:52  maxauthority: but yeah, it's just mercurial iirc :(
18:52  maxauthority: murosai_: maybe a bug?
18:53  maxauthority: anekos: if you do it on gitub, i'd still recommend to name it vimperator-plugins
18:53  maxauthority: to not a) confuse people and b) if we move vimperator sometime there (not likely), the name is still free
18:53  anekos: for oranization name? (not repository name)
18:54  anekos: ah, got it > confuse
18:54  anekos: ok, I will not use "vimperator" for name
18:55  anekos: if I use github, I want to add other repos. so "vimperator-plugins" is not good.
18:55  anekos: e.g. code-snippets
19:12  maxauthority: vimperator-extras?
19:13  maxauthority: or non vimperator-related code-snippets?
19:13  anekos: no, it's vimp related snippets
19:14  anekos: I add other committers easy.
19:14  anekos: s/add/want to add/
19:18  anekos: if plugin repos is in vimperator repository, it makes higher threshold.
19:18  anekos: IMO.
19:25  maxauthority: well, i could give you admin rights i guess, but it's really up to you, github is also ok
19:27  anekos: maxauthority: ok. when I will decide, I'll tell you. thanks.
19:28  maxauthority1: well, i could give you admin rights i guess, but it's really up to you, github is also ok
19:28  maxauthority1: anyway, gotta go
19:28  maxauthority1: cu
19:28  anekos: cu :D
19:28  Segaja: maxauthority: you don't want to look at the tab issue, right?
19:29  blueyed: Is util.copyToClipboard a FF function being dropped/moved in FF4?
