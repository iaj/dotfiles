00:03  maxauthority2: :) are you a software consultant or something like that?
00:04  Dark_Ebola: worse ... I'm a system developper who administer a scientific grid of clusters
00:07  maxauthority2: oh :)
00:07  maxauthority2: cool, although not my type of thing. Those damn pcs should just work, without any administration :)
00:08  Dark_Ebola: they would, without users breaking them :P
00:08  maxauthority2: anyway, i am tired, need to get some sleep. good night and patches for vimperator welcome, since you are a developer :)
00:08  maxauthority2: yeah, damn users
00:08  Dark_Ebola: good night :)
00:57  aksr: how to complete search sequence on google, from the list above ?

14:27  Segaja: in line 7 or so you see "use strict";
14:27  Segaja: remove it or add // at the beginning of th eline
14:27  Segaja: then restart firefox
14:28  Segaja: that is a temporary fix. i will look into it more closely next week
14:28  aksr: :)
14:28  Segaja: i added some "use strict" statements in my last patches, but i guess some of them broke some functions
14:29  aksr: Segaja, are you pro ?

19:06  maxauthority3: ok, i think the completion list itself has the final styling now. Anyone interested please check out the latest trunk version, type :open <tab><tab>,... and tell me your impressions
19:07  maxauthority3: the : prompt still needs to be styled, maybe even replaced with a nice ">" "graphic" (or otherwise better design)
19:10  maxauthority3: http://f.666kb.com/i/bnrmosolry7ucotjh.png
19:10  maxauthority3: probably i should get rid off the ~ lines though
