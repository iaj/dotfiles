21:32  Segaja: maxauthority and gkatsev: FF4 has just landed the menubutton on linux and it has problems with vimp
21:58 --- reactor is now known as reactor|off
22:01  maxauthority: Segaja: saw that they landed it, but sad it has problems :(
22:01  maxauthority: which kind of problems?
22:08  garbas_: hey guys
22:08  garbas_: running Minefield (4.0b8pre) and vimperator (3.0pre) and i would like to get rid off all the bars
22:08  garbas_: all nice, but there is "Add-ons bar" for which i dont see option to remove it
22:08  garbas_: via vimperator (via clicking is possible but then the state is restored after i restart FF)
22:09  garbas_: any suggestions/pointers how could fix this?
22:09 --- garbas_ is now known as garbas
22:11  maxauthority: mhm, i like this idea, i just came with for vimp3.0: replace 'guioptions' with a stringlist. Also changing semantics to :set guioptions=[no]option: :set guioptions=nomenubar would force hiding of the menubar, while :set guioptions=menubar whould show the menubar, and :set guioptions= doesn't touch anything and let's Firefox decide what to do. - what are your thoughts?
22:11 @gkatsev: garbas: you should be able to turn the addon bar off via the menus.
22:12  garbas: gkatsev: menus? hmm ... a yes ... :emenu, right?
22:12 @gkatsev: that too
22:12 @gkatsev: :emenu View ...
22:15  maxauthority: probably we should add :set guioptions+=[no]addonbar as well of course
22:15  garbas: gkatsev: running "emenu View.Toolbars.Add-on Bar" doest work ... how can i hide toolbar via :emenu
22:15 @gkatsev: i dont know what the option name is
22:15  garbas: gkatsev: or better ... where can i read this in :help
22:18  Segaja: maxauthority: first question: where did you see it?
22:19  Segaja: maxauthority: second: if i disable the menu bar via the normal FF menu View -> Toolbars -> Disable menuebar; it shows the button, but than :set go!=m will not work and no errors on the console
22:20 @gkatsev: garbas: um... yeah, not sure how that would work. just enable the menu bar, disable the addonbar and then disable the menu bar again, lol
22:20  garbas: gkatsev: http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=238
22:23  garbas: is there any mirror of vimp on github?
22:23  garbas: or any other git repo
22:24  Segaja: maxauthority: and somehow the bookmar button is goon, too
22:25 @gkatsev: I think there was a github mirror, but it's probably out of date
22:26  maxauthority: Segaja: on some planet mozilla blog entry
22:26  garbas: gkatsev: u have link?
22:26  Segaja: strange. i have the RSS for that.. i must have missed it
22:27 @gkatsev: um... nope, sorry. :)
22:27  maxauthority: Segaja: ok, was a different blog: http://www.google.com/reader/view/#search/linux%20menu/1
22:30  Segaja: okay
22:32  maxauthority: Segaja: so it's just "slightly" broken but no real show stopper for now?
22:32  maxauthority: (the linux menu button)
22:37  Segaja: right
22:37  Segaja: but for a realese it should be fixed
22:38  garbas: gkatsev: solution for now
22:38  garbas: gkatsev: solution for now: ":js document.getElementById('addon-bar').collapsed = 1;"
22:38 @gkatsev: heh
22:38 @gkatsev: you can also probably use :set!
22:39  garbas: i'm not that familiar with options
22:39  garbas: which option to set?
22:39 @gkatsev: not sure, lol
22:39  garbas: :)
23:19  Segaja: maxauthority: i would suggest to wait a few days. maybe the new button is not yet bug free
23:19  maxauthority: garbas: good solution (for now) :) (the :js)
23:19  maxauthority: Segaja: yeah sure
23:20  maxauthority: i always do that for new FF features :)
23:20  maxauthority: worked often
23:20  Segaja: hehe
23:20  maxauthority: and i don't have problems with the FF button on windows firefoxes
23:20  garbas: maxauthority: ":js" gives you possibility to "rape" FF :)
23:21  Segaja: i don't understand how mozilla could remove the status bar without thinking about the download indicator
23:21 @gkatsev: Segaja: didn't they move it to the addonbar?
23:21  Segaja: don't know. i don't have it enabled
23:21  Segaja: i don't see the point in that bar
23:21  Segaja: it takes too much space
23:22  maxauthority: it's only temporary anyway
23:22  maxauthority: addons are proably supposed to to right to the main toolbar (like in chrome)
23:22  maxauthority: (and which makes sense)
23:22  Segaja: yeah, they told me once there are some ideas of a new download interface, but it is not part of FF4
23:22 @gkatsev: yeah, that's probably want they want people to go towards
23:23  garbas: Segaja: not yet ... but it think i might land into FF4 soon
23:23  Segaja: not in 4.0
23:24  Segaja: FF4 is in feature freeze atm
23:24 --- clizzin_ is now known as clizzin
23:24  garbas: shame ...
23:25  garbas: maybe vimp could do better job
23:26  Segaja: oh?
23:26  garbas: better then FF does right now (sounded bad:P)
23:27  Segaja: in which area?
23:27  garbas: showing download in a more "vim-like" style
23:27  garbas: i'm just thinking loud here
23:28  garbas: instead of opening download windows with ":downlaod" maybe listing downlaods with progress like it does for buffers/tabs
23:28  maxauthority: would make sense... patches accepted :)
23:29  Segaja: OH NO... stupid FF has fucked up my running vimp instance again..
23:29  garbas: maxauthority: yup ... not saying somebody should do it :P ... first i need to setup github mirror for me
23:29  maxauthority: great :)
23:29  maxauthority: awaiting your patches :)
23:35  garbas: i'm new to vimperator, hell i'm re-learning js again... :P
23:35  garbas: maxauthority: you want me to create vimperator organisation on github and put the mirror there?
23:35 @gkatsev: lol, I was about to trigger `eloquent @ garbas
23:35 @gkatsev: alas, no such trigger here
23:36  Segaja: that is not bad, if you use the right book to do it :)
