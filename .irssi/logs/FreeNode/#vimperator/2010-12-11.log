04:53  mikebling: anyone know of a quick way to get focus back in google instant...it's driving me nuts
05:18 @gkatsev: gf
05:18 @gkatsev: though, it may be broken
05:20 --- zong_sharo1 is now known as zong_sharo
09:39  mikebling: gkatsev: gf is broken that's what's driving me nuts
11:01  pinkisntwell: why does vimperator ring the bell when i press caps lock?
11:06  maxauthority4: pinkisntwell: because it's an unknown vimperator key (and a bug). should be fixed in the dev version
11:07  maxauthority4: gf for gettign focus back?
11:07  Segaja: maxauthority4: how is the help system coming? *duck and hide* :D
11:09  pinkisntwell: οκ
11:17  maxauthority4: Segaja: i don't know, shouldn't you give me an update report? ;)
11:17  maxauthority4: hmm, we need to remove/change :dia checkupdates, as it doesn't work anymore in recent FF4 as it's incorporated in :dia about
11:18  Segaja: i would remove it
11:18  Segaja: maxauthority4: i tried to fix the help system and failed
11:19  Segaja: i think the next step would be to generate it on commit or something
11:20  maxauthority4: well, i am also not sure if that's the best solution, IF we can make xml+xslt work reliable (as that would probably save some size in the xpi)
11:21  maxauthority4: and especially the problem might be that the help completions rely on xml parsing, dunno
11:22  Segaja: the problem is that at least two bugs in FF work against us
11:22  Segaja: kris seems to be somewhat involved. i saw comments on one of the bugs in bugzilla.mozilla.org
11:44  maxauthority4: good
11:46  Segaja: i try to keep track on the progress of these bugs
12:02  maxauthority4: great!
12:03  Segaja: but i'm not qualified to fix vimp against these bugs
13:32  cantabile: hello
13:42  cantabile: in firefox 4, when I say ':tabopen foo' the command doesn't disappear and I can't see the address until I press esc - is this the intended behaviour?
14:27  Segaja: cantabile: yes
14:27  Segaja: it is
14:28  cantabile: hmm
14:29  Segaja: which address is not shown?
14:29  Segaja: the one at the bottom right?
14:29  cantabile: the address of the page currently loaded
14:29  cantabile: yes, bottom right
14:29  Segaja: this will be removed in the view by default for FF4 anyway
14:29  cantabile: also the address of any link I hover
14:29  Segaja: because the default in FF4 is that vimp will leave the normal addressbar of firefox open
14:29  Segaja: that is in the firefox address bar
14:30  cantabile: the navigation toolbar?
14:30  Segaja: right
14:31  Segaja: this will be visible by default in FF4 + vimp3.0pre
14:31  cantabile: I see
14:39  cantabile: it's not so bad, once you rip out all the buttons on the navigation toolbar :)
14:53  cantabile: there is another problem: commands like '12gt' don't appear if I type them after, say, a :tabopen
14:54  Segaja: hit esc first?
14:54  cantabile: that does help but..
14:55  cantabile: why do commmands like :tabopen stick around anyway?
14:56  Segaja: you have to ask maxauthority4 for that
14:56  cantabile: ok
15:14  anekos_: moki
15:22  maxauthority4: cantabile: Segaja: keeping commands in the commandline was from vim-compatibility. I am not sure yet, if it's a good idea or not, as i am so used to that that i probably like the current behavior
15:25  cantabile: ok
15:50  anekos_: Currently fx4b8pre has a bug(maybe), and it breaks completion. so I post to bugzilla https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618563
15:56  anekos_: and the temporary patch for the issue http://pastebin.com/51azy8Nv
16:06  maxauthority4: anekos_: i just updated firefox, but don't see a completion bug, how can i reproduce it?
16:06  Segaja: maxauthority4: what about the groups in :ls and :buffers stuff?
16:06  Segaja: since :help is broking anyway for me i don't see any reason to hold this back
16:07  maxauthority4: Segaja: help is only broken if you use tab groups. If you don't, :help currently works apart with the patch (iirc)
16:07  anekos_: execute this code http://pastebin.com/QG43xPXi　and press ":tabopenx<Space>" wait 2sec and press "<tab>"
16:08  maxauthority4: Unknown paste ID!
16:08  Segaja: well since i ust tabgroups a lot it is broken vor me
16:08  maxauthority4: Segaja: right, but the patch would also break it for people NOT using it
16:08  anekos_: hmm? I can see the paste.
16:09  maxauthority4: anekos_: oh, the link had trailing spaces
16:09  maxauthority4: (in gnome-terminal)
16:09  Segaja: which i still can't believe
16:09  anekos_: ah, sorry
16:09  maxauthority4: anekos_: seems to hang with "generating results..."
16:10  anekos_: it's not important point
16:11  maxauthority4: anekos_: strange that :tabopen works though
16:11  maxauthority4: (and other completions)
16:11  anekos_: no :tabopenx
16:13  anekos_: maxauthority4: Are you using Fxb8pre (minefield)?
16:14  maxauthority4: anekos_: i use the nightly from yesteray, and :tabopenx doesn't work, but other completions do
16:14  maxauthority4: so it's interesting why only that fails
16:14  maxauthority4: anekos_: the question is, if mozilla is quick to fix the issue, or we should really work around it now
16:14  maxauthority4: (as with your patch). Changes in completion codes are always hairy, as they might introduce other problems in areas which aren't tested
16:15  maxauthority4: but if you can make sure, your patch is a good workaround, then just apply it (with a reference to the mozilla bug as a comment)
16:15  maxauthority4: need to go now, sorry
16:15  anekos_: ":tabopenx<space" wait 2sec "<tab>" -> http://gyazo.com/0f4bd430db91fceecfc64693ce2cf255.png
16:16  maxauthority4: ah! now i get it
16:16  anekos_: :D
16:16  maxauthority4: :)
16:16  maxauthority4: i rather wondered why it's an "endless" generating results...
16:17  maxauthority4: well, as i said: If your fix is unlikely to break other things and works well, just apply it
16:18  anekos_: ok
18:10  finnomenon: hi
23:35  Ddorda: ‎hey guys
23:36  Segaja: hi
23:36  Ddorda: ‎i have a friend who installed vimperator plugin and now wants to remove it. do you have any idea how?
23:36  Segaja: :dia addons
23:36  Ddorda: ‎Segaja: many thanks!
23:36  Segaja: np
23:37  Segaja: or he can shutdown firefox and remove the extension folder from the firefox profile folder
