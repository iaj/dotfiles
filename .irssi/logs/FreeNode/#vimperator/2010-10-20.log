08:40  gadmyth: can I ask vim question in this chatroom?
08:57  Segaja: gadmyth: #vim would be a better place
11:08  C2H5OH: hi
11:09  C2H5OH: is there a way to list the current tab browsing history?
11:09  C2H5OH: like the popup menu attached to the "back" button in Firefox
11:10  C2H5OH: oh wait, the :back command has completion
11:10  C2H5OH: damn, I always think after asking
11:10  C2H5OH: sorry for that
11:25  Segaja: C2H5OH: :history might be something
11:29  C2H5OH: Segaja: yeah, but :back allows me to pick one and go there
11:29  C2H5OH: :history just shouws
11:29  C2H5OH: shows*
11:30  C2H5OH: and besides, I only was looking for the current tab history
11:30  C2H5OH: my question was phony anyway, I found the solution as I was writing it
11:30  C2H5OH: by the way, why is muttator now depending on TB 3.3?
11:30  C2H5OH: I saw a commit mentioning it
11:31  C2H5OH: http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/source/detail?r=b304463e00a0dd40a88db6470be295a7c1e62a65
11:41  Segaja: because in that commit we did some fixes to the XULBrowserWindow in liberator that require newer versions of mozilla software like TB 3.3 and FF 4.0
11:45  Segaja: maxauthority3: :help is totally broken for me again
11:47  C2H5OH: :-(
11:47  Segaja: C2H5OH: which version of FF and vimperator are you using?
11:47  C2H5OH: so, does that mean there won't be a muttator version for TB 3.1?
11:47 --- Chousuke_ is now known as Chousuke
11:47  C2H5OH: let me check
11:48  Segaja: C2H5OH: the one that is out? or some snapshot that is from before the commit
11:48  C2H5OH: FF: 3.6.10, vimperator: 2.3.1
11:48  Segaja: okay..
11:48  C2H5OH: Segaja: the current TB release
11:48  C2H5OH: is 3.1.x
11:48  Segaja: i know
11:48  C2H5OH: but latest stable muttator
11:48  Segaja: is for?
11:49  C2H5OH: 3.0
11:49  C2H5OH: muttator 0.6 does not install in TB 3.1
11:49  Segaja: than try a snapshot from before the commit you linked above
11:49  C2H5OH: I can change the RDF file manually, but it doesn't feel right
11:50  Segaja: C2H5OH: http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/downloads/detail?name=muttator-20100629.xpi&can=2&q=#makechanges
11:51  Segaja: aeh i mean http://vimperator-labs.googlecode.com/files/muttator-20100629.xpi
11:52  C2H5OH: thanks :-)

13:24  Segaja: maxauthority3: does :set go!=m work for you?
15:34  noesc: I have somehow managed to turn on autohide for the tab-bar, how do I turn this off again?
15:37  noesc: :he toolbarshow does not generate much info either :(
15:45  Segaja: noesc: try :set go+=T
16:00  aksr: Segaja, how to turn off, the fullscreen in command mode ? set fullscreen=false ?
16:05 --- Zambezi_ is now known as Zambezi
16:14 --- josue is now known as j0su3
16:18  noesc: Segaja: that only enables the "addressbar" but both the tabbar and addressbar are still autohiding
16:27 @gkatsev: aksr: :set nofs
16:30  aksr: gkatsev, :)
17:10  dv-: what's with the vimperator fork? is it legitimate?
17:10 @gkatsev: yes

21:35  pinkisntwell: i'm trying ":echo document.getElementById('something')" and i get "null"
21:35  pinkisntwell: how come?
21:36  pinkisntwell: i know that the id exists. doesn't vimperator have access to the dom?
21:39 @gkatsev: pinkisntwell: use content rather than document. vimperator is the document.
21:40  pinkisntwell: @gkatsev: but if i use document.title it works correctly
21:41  pinkisntwell: @gkatsev: and if i use content.getElementsByClassName i get "not a function"
21:41 @gkatsev: content.document or something like that
21:41  pinkisntwell: content.document, yes
21:41 @gkatsev: dont have vimperator open infront of me
21:41  pinkisntwell: thanks
21:41 @gkatsev: np

21:52  pinkisntwell: is there some way to accept keyboard events from scripts in vimperator? or should I do it with :map?
22:06  bikefridaywalter: example script pinkisntwell?
22:08  bikefridaywalter: :map should do it if i understand you correctly
22:08  bikefridaywalter: you could also make a new :command and then :map that
