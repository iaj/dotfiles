16:41  Segaja: maxauthority3: could it be, that guioptions are broken all together?
16:42  Segaja: it seems like whenever i enable an option, i can't disable it the normal way. so i have to re-source the .rc file
16:55  maxauthority3: did you already restart your browser?
16:55  Segaja: yeah
16:55  Segaja: and just enabled m and wanted to disable it
16:55  Segaja: had to resource
16:56  maxauthority3: and did you disable TMP?
16:56  Segaja: nope
16:56  Segaja: hang on a sec..
16:57  Segaja: lol?
16:57  maxauthority3: i guess that's the cullprint
16:57  Segaja: i have a second insance of FF with the same setup and there it works
16:57  maxauthority3: strange
16:57  Segaja: yeah
16:58  Segaja: and in my main FF instance i get some big exception when trying to enable m now
16:58  maxauthority3: how did you start your 2 instances?
16:59  maxauthority3: with firefox --no-remote ?
16:59  Segaja: yeah
16:59  Segaja: and the second profile is a copy of the main one
17:00  Segaja: could you open common/content/liberator.js for a sec?

17:05  Segaja: around line 1121
17:06  Segaja: in 1121 i have: elem.collapsed = (opts.indexOf(opt) == -1);
17:06  maxauthority3: right
17:06  Segaja: how can opts be not present?
17:06  Segaja: vimperator: TypeError: opts is undefined
17:06  Segaja: vimperator: TypeError:Â opts is undefined::
17:06  Segaja: vimperator: fileName: "chrome://liberator/content/liberator.js"
17:06  Segaja: vimperator: lineNumber: 1121
17:06  Segaja: vimperator: message: "opts is undefined"
17:06  maxauthority3: strange
17:06 --- Channel #vimperator was synced in 83 seconds
17:07  maxauthority3: maybe due to a previous error
17:07  Segaja: the first one is at 1171
17:07  Segaja: vimperator: lineNumber: 1171
17:07  Segaja: vimperator: message: "config.tabbrowser.tabContainer is undefined"
17:08  maxauthority3: right
17:08  maxauthority3: that's the main problem, and probably due to TMP
17:08  maxauthority3: we could/should maybe check for tabContainer first
17:09  Segaja: i have an idea
17:14  maxauthority3: good
17:14  maxauthority3: and i just found the fix to a stupid bug :)
17:22  Segaja: ok
17:29  Segaja: strange
17:29  Segaja: in my "other" profile everything works like a charm
17:30  Segaja: even with groups
17:30  Segaja: and TMP and VIMP
17:30  Segaja: on the same TMP and vimperator version
17:31  Segaja: i don't get this
17:32  Segaja: ah hang on. the default instance is running on an old nightly of FF
17:34  Segaja: now (after restart) guioptions work fine
17:34  Segaja: might have been a bug in the panorama feature of FF
17:42  Segaja: maxauthority3: it looks as if the + button in n-mode is not the cause of the increased height of the tabs. the button itself is not as high as the tabs get with +n mode
17:42  Segaja: if these two bugs (increased height and + button appearing) are fixed i might even consider using them
