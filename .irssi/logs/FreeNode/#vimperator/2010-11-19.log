14:57  trigger_: hello, when i open a tab in a new window (ctrl+mouse), then go to that tab, then close it, I end up in the tab to the right of it, that is, the tab on the right of the original tab.
14:57  trigger_: more generally, when i close a tab i end up in the tab to the right of it, can you change this behaviour?
14:57  trigger_: sometimes it seems it's going to the left first and then directly to the right
14:59  Segaja: trigger_: you close the tab with d?
15:00  trigger_: yes, but it seems to behave the same with ctrl+w
15:01  Segaja: ctrl-w should go to the last active tab
15:01  Segaja: and it works for me
15:05  trigger_: also doesn't work without vimperator enabled apparently
15:09  iaj: can someone help me im running OSX and minefield 4.0b8 in combination with latest vimperator from HG - but the <c-i> functionality isn't working anymore - when I hit it.. its just yellow flashing but nothing happens - someone able to help??
16:42  maxauthority: iaj: maybe you don't have gvim installed correctly?
16:44 @gkatsev: do you have the editor setting set correctly?
16:45  iaj: gkatsev: well in dactyl its working :(
16:45  iaj: set editor='/Users/iaj/bin/mvim --remote-wait-silent'
16:45  iaj: that's my setting. 
16:46 @gkatsev: weird
16:46  maxauthority: doesn't dactyl use polling now?
16:46  maxauthority: instead of threading?
16:47  Segaja: polling sounds fail
16:47  maxauthority: well, it has advantages as well
16:47  maxauthority: like updates while you edit the text in the external editor
16:48  iaj: weird hits it ;\

21:01  maxauthority1: iaj: i am sure there are some, you'll rather find them in their irc channel though (although probably a few are in both)
21:02  Segaja: maxauthority1: what is the next step on your list towards vimp3.0?
21:03  maxauthority1: fixing more bugs :)
21:04  Segaja: okay
21:04  maxauthority1: currently i am looking into why :all<tab> lists :quitall and things, and isn't anchored
21:04  Segaja: like :help? *duck*
21:04  maxauthority1: then there are more formatting fixes to do
21:04  maxauthority1: then some more simplification, so just what comes up
21:06  Segaja: btw. if you rewrite some stuff, the help system is automatically updated?
21:06  Segaja: like removing N for numbers?
21:06  Segaja: i can't remove tabnumbers with :set go-=n
21:06  Segaja: if i type: :set go
21:07  Segaja: i get: guioptions=undefined

21:17  maxauthority1: doesn't for me
21:17  maxauthority1: maybe due to the + button change
21:17  maxauthority1: but go+=n works now? at least doesn't break all things?
21:17  Segaja: hang on
21:17  Segaja: lol, now i can't enable it anymore
21:17  Segaja: something really crashed :D
21:17  Segaja: but i don't want to restart the FF with 51 tabs
21:18  Segaja: and no erros
21:18  Segaja: errors
21:18 --- Channel #vimperator was synced in 345 seconds
21:19  Segaja: i get an "invalid option"
21:20  maxauthority1: sorry, have to go soon now, please investigate further if you keep having this problem
21:22  Segaja: i don't have the time atm and i didn't use tab numbers before, so i don't really miss them ;)
21:38  maxauthority1: restarting firefox got better as it doesn't load all tabs at once during startup
21:39  maxauthority1: bust max. 3, and the rest on demand
21:40  Segaja: yeah well, my pc is needing the cpu at the moment. :)
