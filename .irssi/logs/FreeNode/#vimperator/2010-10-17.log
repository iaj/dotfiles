14:24  Segaja: gkatsev or maxauthority1 around?
14:25  Segaja: when i use the latest vimp repo and FF4 nightlies i don't see the tabs. when i type: :set go-=T
14:26  Segaja: it said earlier "Unknown variable T" or something like that and know it crashes allways
14:39  maxauthority1: Segaja: yeah
14:40  Segaja: maxauthority1: does the accronym CSP ring any bell?
14:40  maxauthority1: no
14:40  Segaja: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP
14:40  Segaja: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515797 << landed
14:41  Segaja: CSP WARN:  Directive "violated base restriction: Inline Scripts will not execute" violated
14:41  Segaja: diese nachricht bekam ich eben auf der konsole beim ausfÃ¼hren von :set go-=T
14:46  maxauthority1: right, vimp seems broken with latest nightly
14:46  Segaja: that is what i'm telling this channel for two days :)
14:46  Segaja: i'm currently forced to work without it
14:47  Segaja: because i don't see any windows like completion, buffers and so on and even worse i don't see the tabs of a group
14:47  Segaja: if i have a page open
14:51  maxauthority1: i hate the tab groups, they always seem broken to me
14:51  maxauthority1: i never use them, but still have 3 groups sometimes
14:52  Segaja: you get one group with the vid at the beginning
14:52  Segaja: and your main group which you allways have
14:54  maxauthority1: i restarted firefox and suddenly 15 of my 20 windows were all in a new single group
14:55  Segaja: okay
14:55  Segaja: i heard about that
14:58  Segaja: maxauthority1: what could cause FF to crash when i do go-=T
14:58  Segaja: ?
15:05  maxauthority1: doesn't crash for me
15:06  Segaja: hm srrange
15:06  Segaja: strange
15:06  Segaja: so any idea why i don't see the tabs?
15:12  maxauthority1: try :set showtabline=0 and then :set showtabline=2
15:12  maxauthority1: worked for me
15:13  Segaja: hang on i have to re-enable Vimp
15:14  Segaja: okay, works.
15:14  Segaja: now i have to questions:
15:14  Segaja: 1) how do we fix this?
15:14  Segaja: 2) what about the location bar?
15:18  Segaja: maxauthority1: for a quickfix a :set showtabline=2 is enough
15:18  Segaja: the =0 is not needed
15:18  maxauthority1: ok
15:19  Segaja: but the location bar is still gone
15:19  Segaja: any nice idea how to fix this temporarly?
15:19  maxauthority1: go+=T works for me strangly
15:19  Segaja: not for me
15:19  maxauthority1: Segaja: remove the call to hideGUI() somewhere in liberator.js
15:20  Segaja: tataa
15:20  Segaja: but now the menubar is visible aswell :D
15:20  Segaja: so hideGUI is doing crap?
15:21  maxauthority1: well, not really, but removing it is a workaround
15:21  maxauthority1: (doesn't fix the tab bar though)
15:22  Segaja: but if disabling the hiding works, i would guess the hiding is doing crap
15:23  maxauthority1: well, the hiding does hide the stuff, so that's working :)
15:24  Segaja: uhm so why it is hiding T for me?
15:24  Segaja: if my setup clearly sais that i want T?
15:25  Segaja: my guioptioins clearly state set guioptions=Tb
15:25  maxauthority1: then maybe the part which shows the toolbar is broken
15:25  Segaja: so at first all elements are hidden and then the elements i want are re-enabled?
15:26  maxauthority1: right. this was done to prevent a visual flicker when the user wants go=
15:26  maxauthority1: dunno if it's still needed
15:27  Segaja: okay
15:27  Segaja: so where is the part that re-enables the stuff i want?
15:29  maxauthority1: i guess it's only in your .vimperatorrc, then it's in the 'setter' from the 'guioptions' option
15:29  Segaja: which would be in which file?
15:30  maxauthority1: grep is your friend
15:30  maxauthority1: sorry, don't know all that stuff myself anymore by heart :(
15:30  Segaja: what am i grepping for?
15:30  maxauthority1: guioptions
15:30  maxauthority1: grep guioptions -r .
15:30  maxauthority1: (or with vim :vimgrep guioptions **
15:30  Segaja: hm..
15:31  Segaja: 57 hits
15:32  maxauthority1: well, right, but if you look through the results, the interesting one should be easy to spot
15:32  maxauthority1: most results are comments or docs anyway
15:34  Segaja: maxauthority1: do you mean liberator.js:1151 ?
