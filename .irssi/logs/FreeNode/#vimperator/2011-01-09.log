18:27  Ched: Hello
18:28  Ched: anyone knows if there is any way to make twitter work with vimperator ?
18:39  Segaja: what is not working?
18:39  Ched: can't open links
18:39  Ched: need to click with the mouse
18:40  Segaja: hang on
18:40  Segaja: hm, i don't see any hints with f
18:47  saivert: is there a special page on twitter that is not working. becaue twitter.com work with hints for me
18:48  saivert: I can highlight the input box on top and search
18:48  saivert: I can also "click" the scrolling links, except the hints are stuck and does not scroll with the text
18:48  saivert: but that doesn't matter as much
18:51  Segaja: saivert: any user page i guess
18:51  Segaja: i testet on http://twitter.com/wwwJustBaseFM
18:58  saivert: I just screwed up vimperator. installed a version I built myself from source but the .xpi didn't contain all files
18:58  saivert: guess the makefile doesn't work on windows even though I got msys
18:58  saivert: it seemed to work as I didn't get any error messages when running make
18:58  saivert: I'll just wait until someone else release a new nightly build
19:13  saivert: http://pastebin.com/pKv1gSNK
19:16  Segaja: why do you want to make an XPI if you have the repo?
19:16  Segaja: you can simply use the repo as extension
19:17  saivert: I didn't know I could do that
19:17  saivert: I thought it had to be maked since it contains makefiles
19:17  saivert: usually there is a reason for that
19:17 @gkatsev: make a file in your profile called vimpertaotr@mozdev and inside write the full path to the repo
19:17  Segaja: http://vimperator.org/coding
19:18  Segaja: the makefiles are for the devs to make the release XPIs
19:18  saivert: the repo also contains muttator and that songbird addon
19:18  Segaja: yes
19:19  Segaja: gkatsev: i think your spelling is a bit of :D
19:19  Segaja: saivert: read the link
19:20  Segaja: there is a paragraph about this file
19:20 @gkatsev: hehe, oops
19:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#vimperator -o gkatsev]
19:24  saivert: hehe.. well the new build is unusable
20:18  maxauthority: saivert: why?
20:47  saivert: styling bugs in the command bar
20:47  saivert: need to fix CSS so the text is readable
