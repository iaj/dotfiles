10:39  Segaja: maxauthority2: i have added some liberator.dump() in the for loop at liberator.js:1880 which should be shown on startup and some before the loop and both are NOT displayed so something failes during load of the RC file
10:41  Segaja: maxauthority2: the whole stuff is in a setTimeout() function. the second line in that block is: let init = services.get("environment").get(extensionName + "_INIT");
10:42  Segaja: after that line liberator.dump() is not showing any output
13:00  Segaja: maxauthority3: FIXED IT :)

19:18  maxauthority3: Segaja: iirc, dactyl also did make some changes with XJCSafeWrapper, maybe you could look how they did it
19:43  Segaja: maxauthority4: hi
19:43  Segaja: maxauthority4: do you know in which files?
19:43 * Segaja is too often in the code of the "other side"
19:48  Segaja: maxauthority4: what is XJCSaveWrapper anyway?
19:48  Segaja: maxauthority4: i found the reason why my snapshot script is not working anymore
20:52 --- ehempel is now known as blahblah
20:54 --- blahblah is now known as blahblah33
20:56  blahblah33: any vimperator for seamonkey?
20:57  blahblah33: got a new computer and thinking to try all in one rather than separate ff/tb/chatzilla
20:58  blahblah33: but if no vimperator, I'll probably stick with ff
21:07 @gkatsev: can it run ff addons?
21:10  blahblah33: vimperator doesn't show under seamonkey
21:11  blahblah33: If I go to it by searching under FF addons I find it but the normal 'add to seamonkey' / 'add to firefox' button shows instead as a download button
21:11  blahblah33: I haven't tried forcing it
21:16 @gkatsev: try just downloading and running the file
21:17  blahblah33: Vimperator 2.3.1 could not be installed because it is not compatible with SeaMonkey 2.0.8.
21:17  blahblah33: :-(
21:49  maxauthority4: Segaja: why? @script
21:52  Segaja: maxauthority4: query
