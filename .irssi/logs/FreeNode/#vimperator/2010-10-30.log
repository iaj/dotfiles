00:58  mfwitten: Revision # 4361 is the last revision to support Firefox 3.5 officially, it would seem; unfortunately, the status bar or whatever it's called doesn't seem to display information with that revision (for instance, when hovering the mouse over a link or using `;;'). Just sayin'.
01:15  maxauthority: Segaja: vimp as usual :)
01:16  maxauthority: mfwitten: should work with the latest version
01:16  Segaja: maxauthority: would you mind deleting the latest-snapshot for me?

01:16  maxauthority: Segaja: nope, will do
01:17  maxauthority: done
01:17  maxauthority: you should have rights yourself i guess, if not i'll have to see how i could change that
