02:28  ormaaj: How did you guys make external entities show up in the help pages? I thought that was impossible.
02:59  Defiler: Is it possible to use the value of vimperator.buffer.URL as an argument to an :! external command?

09:49  jpic: hi all, how to find the rss feed of a page with vimperator? this is how normal firefox users can do: http://dailysplice.com/blog/general/how-to-find-an-rss-feed/
10:00  bish0p: ok, vimperator is the bomb.  but how do I get it to show me the URL of the current page?
10:01  bish0p: w/o enabling the menus permanently.  I just forget if a URL is hosted on localhost/file:// vs website sometimes and it makes me sad having to re-enable the menu system.
10:01  bish0p: sweet, midnight question.
10:03  duke42: jpic: try this http://tuxtraining.com/2009/04/13/put-the-rss-button-in-vimperators-display-bar
10:08  bish0p: could I have a permanent status-bar?
10:13  jpic: duke42: totally awesome
10:13  jpic: thanks!
