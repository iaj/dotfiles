10:16  kennym: hi, is someone already working on porting muttator to Thunderbird 3.1.x versions?
10:17  Segaja: i don't know of anyone. in fact the snapshots are already 3.3.x
10:20  kennym: Segaja: really? The ones hosted on Google Code are not
10:20  Segaja: oh no? i thought they where
10:21  kennym: oh, I am using Thunderbird 3.1.7
10:21  kennym: maybe they are
10:21  kennym: should I upgrade?
10:21  kennym: it's the version of the Yum repo on F14
10:24  Segaja: i have not testet 3.3.x yet
10:30  kennym: hmm, 3.3 seems to be too unstable ATM. Any idea how I can create an XPI of Muttator for Thunderbird 3.1.x?
10:31  Segaja: i don't know if it is compatible, but you can checkout the repo, change the install.rdf of the muttator/ folder and use the src-repo as extension
10:32  kennym: Segaja: you mean this line:
10:32  kennym: <Description about="urn:mozilla:extension:file:vimperator.jar">
10:32  kennym: ?
10:33  Segaja: no
10:33  Segaja: first check out the repository
10:33  Segaja: or no even easier
10:33  Segaja: do you have the XPI for 3.0.x ?
10:34  kennym: Segaja: I changed the lines minVersion and maxVersion, and now it works
10:35  kennym: Segaja: yes, I have
10:35  Segaja: yes, that was my suggestion
10:35  Segaja: to increase the maxVersion
10:36  kennym: Segaja: thanks :)
10:37  kennym: it doesn't seem to work if I use the muttator XPI from the repo
10:38  Segaja: ok
10:38  kennym: (muttator does nothing)
10:38  Segaja: hm, i'm no expert with muttator, i never used it much
10:40  kennym: ok, I have just started using Thunderbird yesterday (again)
10:40  kennym: I switched from Mutt
10:40  kennym: but now I miss the keybindings :/
10:40  kennym: anyway, coolest project ever.
10:41  Segaja: it would be best to wait for maxauthority
10:42  kennym: maxauthority?
10:42  kennym: if I want to write patches for latest thunderbird version, from where should I get the api reference?
10:43  kennym: AFAICR the cause to most trouble is the steadily changing thunderbird API, or am I wrong?
10:44  Segaja: i don't know what the problems are
10:44  Segaja: i don't think there is a good muttator api
10:44  Segaja: you have to look at the source
10:55  kennym: looks like it is currently not very active, last big commit was 21st of November
10:56  Segaja: yeah, not many poeple use it at the moment
10:59  kennym: understanding the code is not very easy for me
11:00  kennym: a lot of API calls I don't know about
11:00  Segaja: you are not the only one. my understandig of the code isn't very good either
11:00  Segaja: i have some basic understanding of the structure, but not the details
11:04  kennym: I'm digging into it, now
11:05  Segaja: hf :)
11:06  kennym: Segaja: thanks for all your kind help!
11:06  kennym: :)
11:07  Segaja: no problem
