11:49  kunir: Is there a way to highlight multiple search strings, something simmilar to vim's :match command?
17:33  ndauten: hey all
17:33  ndauten: i was wondering how to change the default search engine with vimperator? I originally succeeded at this, but need to change it back. The dialogue for changing it doesn't save the setting.
17:39  ndauten: I figured out how to get this done by editing the .vimperatorrc file directly. Thanks
17:58  Aondo: is there a way to do d$ to remove tabs from current to end?

22:36  maxauthority3: i am wondering if i shouldn't just release vimperator3 for ff4beta now, or maybe a vimp3.0b1 to addons.mozilla.org
22:37  Segaja: sounds like a nice idea
22:38 @gkatsev: is vimp3 pretty stable?
22:40  Segaja: apart from external editor and help system i think it is
22:41 @gkatsev: maybe call it an alpha then?
22:41 @gkatsev: help is pretty important
22:42  Segaja: and there is an other problem
22:43  Segaja: sometimes i loose some sort of this.value in liberator.js
22:43  Segaja: which cripples all completion and buffer windows and so on
22:46 @gkatsev: yep, sounds like an alpha or a beta to me then
22:58  maxauthority3: gkatsev: :help is working unless people use panorama actively
22:59  maxauthority3: today i am too tired anyway, hopefully i get one out tomorrow or friday, as i am gone then for about 2 weeks as i said
22:59  maxauthority3: would give AMO people time to review it if they work during holidays :)
23:00  maxauthority3: did i already say that i love europe's 5-6 weeks/year holidays in contrast to 2-3 weeks in USA? :)
23:01 @gkatsev: maxauthority3: ah, then a beta is definitely fine.
