00:03  Nezmer: hi, is there a way to zoom an auto-resized image to its original size?
01:23  stiltwater: In the latest vimperator nightly and firefox nightly, If I type o<tab>, I end up at >open http://first.url/on/list[CURSORHERE]pen, and hitting enter gets me to the url with 'pen' appended.  o<tab><shift-tab> gets me >open pen [CURSORHERE]pen

17:54  Segaja: sry for the noise..
18:30  muunleit: Hello
18:30  Segaja: hi
18:33  muunleit: Is it possible to get rid of the tab-bar in firefox4 with vimperator 3?
18:34  Segaja: :help guioptions
18:34  Segaja: i think it is :set go-=T
18:36  muunleit: Thanks, but I have :set go=  and it's still there if I open more the one tab
18:37  muunleit: Even if I :set showtabline=0 there is this bar, empty, ohly with the button to group tabs
18:40  Segaja: go= will enable it
18:40  Segaja: AFAIK
18:40  Segaja: ah sry, T is toolbar
18:40  Segaja: not tabbar
18:40  Segaja: showtabline=0 would be the right choice
18:41  Segaja: but it might be broken
18:41  Segaja: could you open a ticket for that?
18:41  muunleit: I try :-)
18:52  muunleit: sorry, I don't have and I don't want to have a google account :-|
19:02  Segaja: maxauthority1: are you around?
19:13  muunleit: bye
