15:36  iaj: can someone guide me whether theres a way to delete all buffers matching a certain pattern?
17:10  Segaja: maxauthority: ping
17:13  Segaja: maxauthority: the CSP WARN's are from AdBlock Plus
17:15  Segaja: maxauthority: the other errors from vimperator are some incompatibility between firebug and vimperator

19:45  maxauthority1: Segaja: great!
19:45  maxauthority1: (your investigation, thanks)
19:47 @gkatsev: cubi: no, currently all development is focused on ff4. Also, Opera has chrome-like extensions which means that they are not able to do everything that vimperator wants to do. This is also the reason why there is no vimperator for chrome, though, there are other extensions that try to bring vim to chrome, like vimium, so, I'm sure that there will be an extension lke vimium for opera soon, but don't expect vimperator on opera any time soon.
19:54  maxauthority1: yitz_: :set stal=0, but that's broken for FF4
19:54  maxauthority1: Aondo: :set wildoptions=auto ?
19:55  yitz_: stal?
19:55  maxauthority1: any comments on the new style completion headers? did somebody test it out?
19:55  maxauthority1: yitz_: 'showtabline'
19:55  maxauthority1: short form of it
19:55  yitz_: I haven't moved to 4 yet... but I ought to
20:13  maxauthority1: is it possible in CSS to only apply certain attributes if ANOTHER elements visibility changes?
20:14 @gkatsev: you may have to apply the CSS via js then
20:14  maxauthority1: yeah, that's what i wanted to avoid
20:14  maxauthority1: because then it's not changable via :hi anymore
20:15  maxauthority1: I plan to add border-top: "1px dotted gray" to the command line which really looks good imho with an easy on the eye seperation of the content and the new combined statusbar/command line, but when the completion list is open, that line doesn't really look good anymore
20:46  maxauthority1: ok, i solved it differently now - just always have this line but around the whole vimperator bottom bar
20:54  cubi: gkatsev: thanks for your answer :)
