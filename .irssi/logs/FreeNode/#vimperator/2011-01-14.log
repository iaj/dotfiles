15:45  zombie_monkey: Is there any way to enter a sort of permanent "pass keypresses" mode? Ctrl-V passes only one keypress. Say, until ESC is pressed, like you unfocus.
15:53  maxauthority1: zombie_monkey: ctrl-z
15:53  maxauthority1: Segaja: issue 501 might be related to your completion problem you sometimes have
15:55  zombie_monkey: maxauthority1: thank you and sorry, I guess I missed ebcause it's in the beginning and also I think new.

15:57  zombie_monkey: I'll follow updates from now on
