14:12  blacklight: a quick question...i'm using vimperator 3.0 on firefox 4.0b8, i'd like to change the style of the input bar now integrated in the status bar (only that, not the whole status bar), is there a way for doing that?
14:13  blacklight: and also, is there any way for getting back the old prompt with ':' instead of the new '>'-like symbol?
