09:36  vytautas: whatecer i disabled plugin and changed options.
10:02  ikrabbe: Hi, I have a very annoying topic here: When I'm at the vimperator command line and press C-g a find bar will come up, that is never focused or else usefull at all.
10:03  ikrabbe: but C-g is a common action to me to cancel inputs like "follow hint" input or else
10:03  ikrabbe: can you tell me what find bar this is?
10:03  ikrabbe: I hope a map command helps
10:04  ikrabbe: no cmap doesn't helps out here
10:05  ikrabbe: ah wait I forgot the angles
10:06  ikrabbe: ok: cmap <C-g> echo "don't press me again" does at least help and does whats expected
10:07  ikrabbe: hmm but in follow input mode, where it is actually wanted
10:08  ikrabbe: I should also say I'm still using vimperator release 2.3.1 here
10:40  iaj: is anyone here using centerselect plugin by chance?
10:40  iaj: ikrabbe: <C-g> doesn't do anything for me
10:41  iaj: But isn't that usually connected to googlesearch on non-OSX?
10:41  iaj: Ah.. no that's <C-k>, sorry...
10:42  ikrabbe: iaj: it is in command line mode
10:42  ikrabbe: press for example ":" or "F" and then C-g to cancel the input
10:42  iaj: C-g ain't doint anything for me
10:42  ikrabbe: I'm used to do such thing in info for example
10:42  ikrabbe: hmm strange
10:42  iaj: What should it do?
10:42  ikrabbe: I had this problem in any firefox I used by now
10:43  iaj: kill the line?
10:43  ikrabbe: it pops up a firefox find line
10:43  ikrabbe: no <C-g> is like ESC
10:43  iaj: it pop ups - hm
10:43  iaj: sec
10:43  ikrabbe: not really a pop up
10:43  iaj: did you try keyconfig for firefox? the plugin?
10:44  ikrabbe: no
10:44  iaj: I stopped my âŒ˜ N etc from working with it
10:44  ikrabbe: ok you are on an OSX system?
10:44  iaj: follow input mode? what's that?
10:44  iaj: hint mode?
10:44  iaj: yeah.
10:45  ikrabbe: yes thats what I meant
10:45  iaj: why don't u use <C-c>   ?
10:45  ikrabbe: hint mode
10:45  ikrabbe: cause I'm used to C-g and press it to leave input without thinking about
10:45  iaj: hm yeah C-g is working no where for me as well
10:46  ikrabbe: it doesn't bothers me if it doesn't do what I expected, but I absolutely hate that it shows up a find bar that is of no use
10:46  iaj: only escape breaks hintmode. "\
10:46  ikrabbe: iaj: that is no problem, I just want to disable C-g to do anything
10:46  iaj: did you try
10:46  iaj: :cnoremap <C-g> <Esc>
10:47  iaj: at least its worknig for me here
10:48  iaj: but I guess you should find out WHAT findbar that is
10:48  iaj: and just disable plugin whatsoever
10:48  ikrabbe: yes the cnoremap thing seems to work
10:48  iaj: yummy
10:49  ikrabbe: no it doesn't
10:49  ikrabbe: sigh
10:50  iaj: pity :\
10:50  ikrabbe: I fear its no plugin but firefox core
10:51  ikrabbe: hmm C-g is bound to "Edit-Find Again"
10:51  ikrabbe: I assume thats it
10:51  iaj: hmmm I don't think it is :\ lemme try on my WINDOWS (!) machine
10:51  iaj: -_- how did you find that out?
10:51  ikrabbe: By looking at the keys in the menubar (normally disabled here)
10:52  iaj: try the plugin I mentioned
10:52  iaj: it lets you rebind everything iric
10:52  iaj: s/iric/iirc/
10:55  ikrabbe: though it seems a bug that keys are pushed through like C-v in that command mode
10:57  iaj: :\
10:57  iaj: pity - and now?
10:58  ikrabbe: bug - report, weekend debug session, maybe patch building
11:09  iaj: T_T
12:13  iaj: blist
12:13  iaj: oops
