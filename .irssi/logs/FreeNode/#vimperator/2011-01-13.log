05:25  bamccaig: Is vimperator responsible for searching for what you try to open?
05:25  bamccaig: I've set keyword.enabled and browser.fixup.alternative.enabled to false in about:config, but I'm still getting search results for i.e., :tabopen foobar
05:25  bamccaig: Could that be Vimperator doing it?
05:27  gkatsev: bamccaig: :set defaultsearch=<CR>
05:27  gkatsev: or something like that
05:27  gkatsev: don't remember
05:28  bamccaig: That did it, thanks! (It's defsearch)
05:28  gkatsev: cool, np
05:28  bamccaig: Is that a Vimperator option or just an alias for a Firefox option?
05:28  gkatsev: vimperator option
05:29  gkatsev: ff options are set via setbang
05:29  bamccaig: I see. Cool.
