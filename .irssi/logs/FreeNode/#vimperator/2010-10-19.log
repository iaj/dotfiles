18:39  maxauthority1: dpb: firegestures seem nice, although i still don't have any other use apart from back/forward. do you use something else from it?
18:39  maxauthority1: right, and close maybe
18:40  Segaja: back forward = mouse 4 and 5 :)
18:45  maxauthority1: strangely, i do have those mouse buttons on the side, but never use them
18:45  maxauthority1: just didn't get the hang on them, dunno why
18:45  maxauthority1: i even forgot i had them - maybe i should try them again :)
18:46  maxauthority1: so, now trying your patch without a vimprc
18:46  Segaja: i use them all the time and miss them if i have a mouse that doesn't have them
18:46  Segaja: so you did get my second mail?
18:47  maxauthority1: yes
18:47  maxauthority1: i guess that's it - my work mouse doesn't have them
18:47  Segaja: i don't understand why it is showing errors here and not on your end
18:48  Segaja: did you apply my patch to a clean repo?
18:49  maxauthority1: http://pastebin.com/HsEmAh2t
18:50  maxauthority1: only WITHOUT that change i did get the error, so strange
18:50  maxauthority1: maybe someone third could help in testing?
18:51  Segaja: can you paste the errors you get?
18:56  maxauthority1: strange, now i don't get it at all (with my .vimprc moved) :(
18:56  Segaja: WTF?
18:57  Segaja: i get them all the time
18:57  Segaja: when i have the time i'm going to investigage where the places, the errors occur, are called from
19:03  maxauthority1: just tried it again, no error
19:03  maxauthority1: which is good for you, as i'll probably just commit the fix then
19:04  maxauthority1: unless somebody else could help us testing, which would be awesome
19:06  Segaja: i testet it on a clean profile with just vimperator on it
19:06  Segaja: no errors
19:06  Segaja: so it must be something in my profile
19:07  maxauthority1: good!
19:07  maxauthority1: (hopefully)
19:07  Segaja: well if i'm the only one..
19:08  Segaja: i also don't see these in the new profile: CSP WARN:  Directive "violated base restriction: Inline Scripts will not execute" violated
19:08  Segaja: which could mean two things
19:09  Segaja: 1. these warnings are not caused by vimperator, but an other plugin
19:09  Segaja: 2. they are cause by vimperator in which case it is again something in my profile
19:09  Segaja: i will research this stuff more extensively after my oral test on thursday
19:10  maxauthority1: oral test sounds... funny :)
19:10  maxauthority1: in which subject?
19:10  maxauthority1: and good luck
19:10  Segaja: cryptology
19:10  Segaja: thanks
19:10  maxauthority1: i pushed your fix anyway
19:10  Segaja: thanks
19:10  Segaja: which makes the second one. one more on my list :)

19:26  dpb: maxauthority1: opening a new tab from a link, change tab left/right, opening options, opening bookmarks sidebar, restarting, opening an url from clipboard, searching from clipboard, opening tab groups
19:28  Segaja: opening an url from clipboard??? p P
19:28  Segaja: opening a new tab from a link << middle click?
19:30  dpb: Segaja: 1. I'm not using Vimperator. 2. you can't choose if you open it in the background or not from middle click
19:30  Segaja: dpb: both valid points :)
19:30  dpb: :)
19:31  Segaja: i just assumed that everybody who is on this channel uses vimp. sry for the mistake
19:31  dpb: :P
19:33  dpb: and an addition to #1: if I copy the link from elsewhere with the mouse, why should one need to change to the keyboard to open it? <.<
19:34  Segaja: because one always has a hand on the keybord :)
19:34  Segaja: and about the opnening part. f and all his friends are yours in that case :)
19:35  dpb: In my opinion, software is efficient only when you can use it with whatever is at your hand, not specific to the keyboard. That's one reason why I don't use Vimperator anymore.
19:35  Segaja: okay
20:36  Gentooer: Hi, I was trying out the latest firefox beta with a vimperator nightly build, and it seems that my settings in ~/.vimperatorrc are being ignored. Has the config file been moved?
20:36  Segaja: no it has not
20:36  Segaja: it is a bug in vimperator
20:36  Gentooer: Oh ok.
20:36  Segaja: try the repo-version
20:36  Segaja: it should be fixed in there
20:37  Gentooer: Ok thanks.
20:37  Gentooer: Also is there/will there be an option to disable the fade in/out for the command line? I really don't like it.
20:38  Segaja: you have to ask maxauthority1 about that

21:36  maxauthority1: Gentooer: it can/will be done with :highlight
21:36  maxauthority1: the timing isn't optimal though, my plan is to have it here instantly and only fade it out, but don't know yet how to do it
21:37  maxauthority1: OR at least make the fading much faster by default
21:37  Segaja: maxauthority1: what about a new snapshot?
21:37  maxauthority1: Segaja: sounds great! especially since the vimperator-snapshot.xpi is from sept
21:37  Segaja: ah right...
21:38  Segaja: coming up
21:38  maxauthority1: Segaja: did I? @changed the patch? sorry
21:38  Segaja: you commented the old line out
21:38  Segaja: but no problem there
21:39  Segaja: Gentooer: now there is a new snapshot online you can use
21:39  maxauthority1: dpb: you can still load any url with middle click in the content - maybe it's off by default on mac though
21:40  Gentooer: maxauthority1: ah ok, yes faster would be nice
21:40  Gentooer: thanks Segaja I'll check it out
21:42  maxauthority1: try>  :hi CommandLine background: white; -moz-transition: all 0.25s;
21:42  maxauthority1: i guess 0.25 will be the new default at least until i figure out how to just do it on fade out
21:43  maxauthority1: i'll change a few other default colors now anyway (don't like the pink gradient below the groups in completions e.g.) while i am at it
21:43  maxauthority1: some recommendations what else to change?
21:48  Gentooer: I don't know, everything else seems pretty good. I assume that tabs are still being worked on? Right now their names are only displayed in the drop-down menu.
21:48  maxauthority1: hmm?
21:48  maxauthority1: ah, that should be fixed in the newest snapshot
21:48  maxauthority1: (hopefully)
21:48  Gentooer: ah ok didn't try it yet
21:48  Gentooer: bbl
21:54  Segaja: i think the problem he descriped was the RC file not sourced
21:57  maxauthority1: yeah
21:57  Segaja: maxauthority1: what i meant by "chaning the patch" was that in my patch the old line was replaced by the new one. in the patch you applied the old line was commented out and the new line added
21:59  maxauthority1: yeah, was intentional for now
21:59  maxauthority1: to know where we changed that thing. will remove all obsolete comments in future anyway
22:00  Segaja: yeah i thought that it was something like that
22:04  aksr: Segaja, when the problem with the tabs, have been solved ?
22:04  aksr: :D
22:04  aksr: i'm glad...
22:05  Segaja: the should be in the latest snapshot
22:09  Segaja: s/the //
22:10  maxauthority1: does anybody know an application which has awesome looking group headers (like the groups from the :open prompt)
22:27  Segaja: woho
22:28  Segaja: stupid bot
