11:20  Segaja: maxauthority2: why grep for stal?
11:25  maxauthority2: or for showtabline
11:40  maxauthority2: because thats the name of the option
11:55  Segaja: i see
11:59  maxauthority2: :)
12:01  Segaja: interesting code
12:01  Segaja: common/content/tabs.js:1016
12:03  maxauthority2: Segaja: the problem is that even if you manage to hide the toolbar, it might be shown again by firefox one you open a new tab
12:04  Segaja: we are talking about tabbar, riht?
12:04  Segaja: toolbar showing / hiding hasen't worked for me in weeks
12:10  Segaja: i don't get this code...
12:11  maxauthority2: the tabbar in ff3 is a toolbar internally
12:11  maxauthority2: aeh, ff4
12:11  maxauthority2: @code: basically it just hides a certain chrome element
12:13  Segaja: or at least it tries todo :D
12:13  Segaja: browser.tabStrig.autoHide doesn't exist in my FF about:config
12:14  maxauthority2: not every option exists there
12:14  maxauthority2: but well, that's the least problem, to support stal=1
12:15  maxauthority2: stal=0 is the problem, to always keep it hidden
12:15  Segaja: yeah, but i see the point
12:15  Segaja: if you use :set showtabline=0
12:15  Segaja: you still see tha bar with the panorama button and the menu button
12:16  Segaja: so we are hiding the wrong element
12:18  maxauthority2: yes, but if we hide the "correct" element, it gets visisble again if we open a new tab or close an old one
12:19  Segaja: do you know how to hide the correct element?
12:24  maxauthority2: i knew it, forgot it, tried to find it now, but didn't succeed in 5 minutes :)
12:24  maxauthority2: and i need to get prepared for my home trip now, sorry
12:24  maxauthority2: it's something like window.setToolbarVisibility("xxx", false), but you need to find xxx
12:25  Segaja: i found something like gBrowser.setStripVisibilityTo(!gBrowser.getStripVisibility())
12:26  maxauthority2: ah right
12:26  maxauthority2: but then, do a :tabopen foo
12:26  maxauthority2: and it's back
12:26  Segaja: maybe not if we also hide the old tabbar
12:26  Segaja: i.e. the old code
12:31  maxauthority2: the old tab bar doesn't exist anymore like it did
12:32  Segaja: hm, why can't i find any docu on the setStrip... stuff?
12:36  Segaja: we could try to be inspired by dactyl
