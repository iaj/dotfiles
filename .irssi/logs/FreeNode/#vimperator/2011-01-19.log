15:54  garbas: hey guys ... so i dont span the list. about that addon thingy
15:55  maxauthority2: hey garbas
15:55  garbas: so addon thing only applies to vimperator?
15:55  garbas: maxauthority2: hey
15:55  maxauthority2: yes
15:56  garbas: so basicaly copy the whole thing with replace="go" and then add addon bar option there
15:56  garbas: the whole thing == guioptions item
15:56  maxauthority2: probably, let me see for myself first
15:59  garbas: https://gist.github.com/786262
15:59  garbas: maxauthority2: like that? ^^^
15:59  maxauthority2: if it works, it sounds great :)
16:00  maxauthority2: it should work something like this, probably we should use replace="'guioptions'" or what's the real name
16:01  garbas: let me see if it works :P i was just doing what teramako suggested on the list
16:01  maxauthority2: SOMETHING like that should work
16:01  maxauthority2: dunno the correct syntax though
16:01  garbas: sec ... testing
16:12  garbas: maxauthority2: https://gist.github.com/786285
16:13  garbas: this works
16:13  garbas: patch is on mailing list as well
16:14  maxauthority2: great!
16:14  maxauthority2: thanks, will look into it, and then apply
16:15  garbas: tnx
16:18  maxauthority2: garbas: you still don't have an entry in the NEWS file, but this time i'll add it for you :)
