11:04  Aondo: hmm really is not easy to work with vimperator in two firefox windows. i guess i should submit a bugreport :D
11:05  dpb: Or just use one window.
11:06  Aondo: not practical
11:06  dpb: Multiple windows isn't practical.
11:06  Aondo: it is with two or more monitors
11:06  Aondo: when you need to read from one, and write in other, where copy paste isnt suitable
11:06  Aondo: :)
11:07  dpb: Well Vimperator hasn't been designed for multiple windows.
11:09  Aondo: i guess it just need a better way to know what window to put commands in, and when not to do so. since it's the single letter commands that interfare with over windows
11:25  Aondo: well... it's still usable with two windows, it doesnt always missbehave.
