16:59  chin8: is there a way to add extension icon in status bar?
17:00  chin8: the :help 'status' says 'no'

17:01  chin8: p.s. sorry for my eng :)
17:04  chin8: another one: is there a command for 'panorama' feature? :help panorama don't help

21:51  chin8: hi
21:51  Segaja: hi
21:51  chin8: Is there a way to run a command when iceweasel start
21:51  chin8: for example
21:52  chin8: history -remove google
21:52  chin8: ?
21:52  chin8: thanks
21:53 @gkatsev: put it in your RC file
21:57  chin8: simply :history -remove google ?
22:00 @gkatsev: if that is the command, then yes.
22:00 @gkatsev: I dont remember what the actual command would be for this
22:01  Segaja: try the command in a running vimperator instance
22:01  Segaja: if it works, put it in the rc file
22:01 @gkatsev: i think you may want to use the sanitize command or something.
22:09  Segaja: gkatsev: nice link back in ##javascript :D
22:09 @gkatsev: lol
22:09 * gkatsev is tired
22:09  Segaja: you are not the only one ;)
22:15  Segaja: gkatsev: for DOM in that png, i would rather use http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/ecma-script-language-binding.html
22:37  maxauthority: Segaja: can you update both (=-date and -latest) nightly .xpi?
22:37  maxauthority: seems like they are quite old
22:37  maxauthority: aeh, snapshot xpi
22:37  maxauthority: (because of http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=464 )
22:39  Segaja: sure
22:39  Segaja: just vimp, right?
22:40  chin8: thanks gkatsev, it works
22:40  Segaja: maxauthority: done
22:41  Segaja: vimperator-latest-snapshot.xpi and vimperator-20101123.xpi
22:42  maxauthority: thanks!
22:43  Segaja: np. no big deal
22:43  Segaja: just have to delete the -latest- snapshot and trigger one script call :)
22:47  maxauthority: yeah :(
22:48  Segaja: ":(" ?
22:48  Segaja: why so sad?
22:51  chin8: why vimperator latest is incompatible with firefx 4.0b7?
22:52  maxauthority: chin8: because it needs b8 i guess :)
22:53  Segaja: is b8 even "out" yet?
22:53  maxauthority: nope
22:53  maxauthority: b8pre i meant
22:53  maxauthority: maybe b7 would work though
22:53  maxauthority: didn't really test, but b6 was really broken
22:53  Segaja: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=blocking2.0:beta8+ << i guess they have to fixed these bugs first
22:53  Segaja: these are the blocking b8
22:54  Segaja: and there are even more blocking b9
22:54  maxauthority: Segaja: sad, because that involves a manual step
22:56  Segaja: maxauthority: that is a problem with some change in the google code behaviour
22:56  Segaja: i haven't really tried to script around it
22:58  Segaja: i will test something
22:58  Segaja: it might be that the latest-snapshot.xpi will be gone if i'm successfull :D
23:00  Segaja: the problem with scripting that part is i have to script the login to
23:00  Segaja: too
23:01  Segaja: WAHHH, base64 encoded auth token
23:04  maxauthority: base64 isn't that hard :)
23:04  maxauthority: at least in most scripting languages
23:05  Segaja: bash <3
23:05  Segaja: if i'm lucky i can script all this with one line
23:09  Segaja: a location.href='..' change in JS will trigger a GET request, right?
23:10  chin8: How can I disable output of a command (history -remove foo)?
23:11  maxauthority: Segaja: i think so
23:11  Segaja: hm..
23:12  maxauthority: chin8: i don't have any output, apart from the live completions (which of course are slow in this case)
23:14  Segaja: FU
23:16  maxauthority: Fuck You? or what else is FU?
23:17  Segaja: yeah
23:17  Segaja: i fight against google code atm :D
23:21  chin8: when i start iceweasel, i have a lot of "No matching history items for foo"
23:22  chin8: is there a way to, temporarily, disable message
23:22  chin8: ?
23:22  chin8: messages
23:23  chin8: bad english, sorry
23:28 @gkatsev: there is :silent, i think
23:33  chin8: yeah, it works
23:33  chin8: thank you gkatsev
23:34 @gkatsev: yep
23:35  chin8: well, 18 history -remove in vimperatorrc are a bit cpu intensive :)
23:35  Segaja: google-code really wantes to fight...
23:39  chin8: someone know a colorscheme compatible with 3.0pre?
