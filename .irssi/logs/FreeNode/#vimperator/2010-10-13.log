14:49  dpb: maxauthority1: hi
15:56  gwalters: good morning all! Would anyone be kind enough to tell me how to edit the URL of the current tab I have open? Can't seem to find a way other than copy/paste >.<
15:56 @gkatsev: gwalters: O
15:56 @gkatsev: Daneel: open
15:56  Daneel: To open a url in a the current tab use `o'. For opening it in a new tab use `t'. To edit current url and open it in the current tab use `O'. To edit current url and open it in a new tab use `T'
15:57  gwalters: ahh, caps versions of the two. That's hot. Thanks :)
15:58 @gkatsev: :)
16:02  Segaja: maxauthority1: and, is the patch working for you?
