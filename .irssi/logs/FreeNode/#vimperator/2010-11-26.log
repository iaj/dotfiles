00:12  dickwaffles: liberator
00:12  Segaja: just ask your question and if someone can help you, he/she will
00:12  dickwaffles: liberator://help/intro
00:13  dickwaffles: Why is the built-in URL scheme called liberator?
00:13  Segaja: liberator is the basic system for vimperatr/muttator/xulmus
00:13  dickwaffles: what are the other two
00:13  dickwaffles: Why name it after a sex pillow
00:13  Segaja: vimperator = for firefox
00:13  Segaja: muttator = for thunderbird
00:13  Segaja: xulmus = for songbird
00:14  dickwaffles: http://www.liberator.com/
00:14  dickwaffles: sex pillow
00:17  Segaja: i don't think that was the naming idea
00:18  Segaja: just look at the basic meaning of the word

10:37  cantabile: hi
10:38  cantabile: :set autocomplete=false should turn autocompletion off right? in :open and :tabopen
10:39  cantabile: because autocomplete is still true
10:40  cantabile: I'm using the latest snapshot (3.0pre)
14:15  cantabile: hello
14:15  cantabile: I was asking earlier about turn off autocompletion in the latest snapshot
14:15  cantabile: did I miss anything?
14:16  cantabile: anyway, ':set autocomplete=false' doesn't do anything
14:17  cantabile: autocomplete stays true
14:19  cantabile: what to do?
14:19  cantabile: autocomplete=off doesn't work either
14:32  thp: is there a command with which I can switch to a tab by matching the title (i.e. something like :SwitchToTab gmail switches to the first tab containing "gmail" in its title)
14:44  garbas: thp: ":buffer gmail<tab>" (or press b, write gmail, then press <tab.)
14:50  thp: garbas: thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for :)
14:51  garbas: thp: welcome
