10:12  segaja_work: OH HI-
11:30  segaja_work: hi martin
12:22  kevinmoilar: hi there. I'm new to vimperator and thrilled.can't figure  how to scroll through history and select a linck... they don't come up 'clickable' after :history
12:25  segaja_work: try :history!<space>
12:25  segaja_work: don't hit return instantly
12:25  segaja_work: :history! will acceppt a filter and will open the elements which match the filter
12:25  segaja_work: as tabs
12:27 * kevinmoilar tests this
12:29  kevinmoilar: segaja_work: it tells me it will open 1000 tabs, or a few less if i add a keyword
12:31  kevinmoilar: segaja_work: how / what do i add as filter?
12:52  iaj: while we are at it.. can I somehow access the recent bookmarks, from the last 2 weeks or something like that?
12:52  iaj: and another thing can I set the max lenght of the urls shown in completion menu?
13:27  segaja_work: kevinmoilar: you can filter for the name or the url AFAIK
13:28  segaja_work: so if you type part of the url after the :history! part the number of elements should decrease
13:30  kevinmoilar: segaja_work: ah and then use tab completion for the desired url. thanks! still a little puzzling why I can call up the :history but do noting with the result
13:36  segaja_work: you can look at it :)
14:45  segaja_work: hi stepnem
14:46  stepnem: segaja_work: hi
14:46  segaja_work: time for query?
14:51  stepnem: heh
14:51  stepnem: segaja_work: feel free; although I don't see a reason why we can't just speak here?
14:53  segaja_work: weil ich keine lust auf EN habe :D
14:54  stepnem: hah
15:30  iaj: Can someone guide me to a good blocking flash plugin?
15:30  iaj: s/blocking flash/flash blocking/
15:42  nisc: hi. I'm sad.
15:42  nisc: nnoremap ; :
15:42  nisc: nnoremap : ;
15:42  nisc: this works in vim, but not in vimperator
15:42  nisc: is there some way to get what i want?
15:48  nisc: https://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=436
