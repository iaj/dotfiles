12:10  Utopiah: hi #vimperator
12:13  Utopiah: short story, if I delete my FF config folder, restart it, re-install Vimperator, I wont lose my config since its stored outside of FF folder, right?
12:16  Segaja: .vimperatorrc is where your vimperator stuff is saved
12:18  Utopiah: which is ~ and I backed it up anyway but there is more files than that (e.g. ~/vimperator/* )
12:23  Segaja: if there is something in the .vimperator/ folder
12:24  Utopiah: so is the answer yes?
12:25  Segaja: yeah, it would be safer to back this up too
13:07  gueux: do you know why http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=30&q=project%3ALiberator%2CVimperator%20type%3Aplugin&colspec=ID%20Summary%20Project%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Stars%20Owner does not work anymore? (I have no more :stu, :thumbup, ... commands :( )
13:10  Segaja: do you get any error when you load it?
13:10  Segaja: do you still have :stumble?
13:10  gueux: Segaja: you mean with :loadplugins
13:11  gueux: Segaja: no :stumble either
13:11  Segaja: which vimperator do you use?
13:11  Utopiah: hmmm where are marks located already?
13:11  gueux: svn
13:11  gueux: sorry hg
13:12  Segaja: gueux: it might be, that some changes in the repo has affected the plugins
13:12  Segaja: gueux: you might want to ask maxauthority when he is around
13:13  gueux: ok
13:25  gueux: Segaja: ok, plugins located in ~/.vimperator/plugin weren't load automatically
13:25  gueux: adding loadplugins in my vimperatorrc works
13:32  Segaja: ok
