19:29  bamccaig: I tried setting editor to /home/bamccaig/bin/vim-terminal, which equates to this:   /usr/bin/gnome-terminal --command="/usr/bin/vim *$"
19:30  bamccaig: It causes Firefox to crash, however.. :(
19:30  bamccaig: (When I press C-i)
19:34  bamccaig: Sigh. I even tried remapping it for "It's All Text" instead:   noremap <C-i> <C-v><C-i>
19:34  bamccaig: Still crashed. >:(
