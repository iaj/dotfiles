02:09  aksr: maxauthority4, you here ?
02:18  maxauthority4: aksr: now, but just for 3 minutes
02:18  maxauthority4: then i am sleeping
02:18  maxauthority4: Segaja: the one about changes for ff4 and developers? yes
02:20  aksr: maxauthority4, for caret mode
02:21  aksr: i was thinking
02:21  maxauthority4: yeah?
02:21  aksr: that one of the things to make caret better
02:21  aksr: is when the yanking
02:21  aksr: is complete
02:21  aksr: the normal mode activates
02:22  aksr: :)
02:22  aksr: caret-->visual
02:22  aksr: yanking-->normal
02:22  aksr: :)
02:22  aksr: do you understand what i try to say ?
02:23  aksr: 2 or 3 ESC
02:23  aksr: back to normal
02:23  aksr: isn't very convenient
02:24  maxauthority4: i understand
02:24  maxauthority4: but that's the least problem
02:24  aksr: caret is very useful in non-flash cites
02:24  maxauthority4: and it doesn't make sense to start normal mode after yanking
02:24  aksr: i know. :)
02:24  maxauthority4: at least conceptually
02:25  aksr: i offten yank some word
02:25  aksr: to find it on the web
02:25  aksr: so
02:25  maxauthority4: anyway, a :map -modes=caret y y<esc><esc> is probably what SHOULD work (doesn't now)
02:25  aksr: tabnew maybe ?
02:25  maxauthority4: if you really use caret mostly for yanking
02:27  maxauthority4: no, i'd rather map 'p' in caret mode for that feature
02:27  maxauthority4: but until caret mode is actually usable on all/most sites, it's still rather a feature slated for removal
02:27  aksr: i know
02:27  aksr: tables
02:27  aksr: arghhh
02:27  aksr: :)
02:28  aksr: frames
02:28  aksr: arghhh
02:28  aksr: :)
02:31  clizzin: What does red mean on Vimperator's status line?  It's not covered in http://vimperator.org/help/vimperator/gui.xhtml#status-line, and I'm seeing red on a site that I'm connecting to with https, so it can't be all that bad, can it?
02:32  aksr: what site ?
02:32  aksr: link..

14:53  tremby: i just thought i'd try out muttator since i've been using vimperator for a long time. i am already lost though. where is the tutorial? if i do :help and then click the "tutorial" link thunderbird (3) asks me how to open a liberator link. if i say thunderbird nothing happens. if i say firefox i get the vimperator help, not the muttator help.
14:54  tremby: oh. :help tutorial got it for me
