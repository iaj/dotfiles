14:55  miguel000: was there some key combination to follow a link that says NEXT?
14:55  miguel000: because I think I saw soemthing like that in the :help, but can not find it anymore
14:57  Utopiah: ]]
15:03  miguel000: thank you Utopiah
15:06  Utopiah: np
20:10  i3d: what's the shortcut key for copying the current webpage's url?
20:10  Utopiah: y
20:11  i3d: ok, so just yank it and then turn to another page with input box, what should I do to paste there?
20:11  Utopiah: shift+insert
20:12  i3d: ah... ok.
20:12  Utopiah: eventually gi before
20:12  i3d: what if my mac does not have insert key mapped?
20:13  i3d: ok, looks like yank copies the string to the sys clipboard, well that at least works with mouse copy. :)
20:13  Utopiah: ctrl-v to go through then then classical paste
20:15 @gkatsev: <c-v><c-p> works
20:15 @gkatsev: in vimp3 for ff4 max is working on moving c-v to something else and keeping c-c/v/x/p as standard keys
20:17  i3d: ok I see.
20:19 @gkatsev: Daneel: yank
20:19  Daneel: y is for yanking current URL. Y is for yanking currently selected text.  Use ;y to yank the URL of a link.
20:19 @gkatsev: fwiw
20:22  i3d: Daneel: very cool
20:23  i3d: wish there is such ext for chrome...
20:24 @gkatsev: there is vimium and vim-like smoozie but due to chrome's non-extensive extension support they lack most of the features vimperator provides and thus liberator will not be ported any time soon either.
20:24 @gkatsev: Daneel: competitors

20:25 @gkatsev: Daneel: help
20:25 @gkatsev: Daneel: yank
20:25 @gkatsev: Segaja: Daneel died :(
20:25  Daneel: okay, gkatsev
20:25  Daneel: no, no plans currently. All dev focus is currenly on Vimperator 3.0 for ff4. Chrome currently does not provide extension support robust enough to do what vimperator does and thus it would be only a fraction as useful. For now, you could try some of the extensions available on chrome like Vimium.
