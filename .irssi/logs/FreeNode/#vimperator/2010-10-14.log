16:18  aksr: Segaja, is it possible to save multiple sessions ?
16:19  Segaja: aksr: don't know.
16:20  dpb: Possible with some firefox extensions, but don't know how compatible they are with vimperator..
16:21  aksr: Segaja, :)
16:21  aksr: dpb, i know..i was thinking on vimperator, alone.
16:21  aksr: :)
16:21  dpb: Vimperator doesn't support them afaik
16:22  aksr: dpb, i supposed that, but its better to ask,..
16:22  dpb: Sure :)
16:23  aksr: maxauthority3, is there a hope, for multiple sessions save in future ?
16:23  aksr: :)
16:25  Segaja: afaik max is currently planning to make vimp smaller not larger
16:25  dpb: Probably could be done in a vimp plugin
16:26  aksr: Segaja, yes i'm aware...but some features are essencial
16:26  aksr: :)

18:15  Segaja: and he is not :D
18:17  dpb: maxauthority3: !
18:17  dpb: I'm nearly here atleast
18:18  dpb: (But is *he* anymore?)
18:20  maxauthority3: :)
18:20  maxauthority3: yeah, i am
18:20  maxauthority3: but you were lucky, was about to go
18:20  dpb: :P
18:20  dpb: maxauthority3: I started using firefox again ;o
18:21  Segaja: maxauthority3: how is the test going?
18:21  maxauthority3: dpb: cool!
18:21  maxauthority3: as i said, FF4 is quite cool, right?
18:21  maxauthority3: at least much faster for me
18:22  dpb: Yep, starts up even faster than chrome..
18:22  maxauthority3: dpb: yeah, they delay loading saved tabs now
18:22  maxauthority3: nice feature
18:22  dpb: yeah
18:22  maxauthority3: Segaja: looks good, i am more worried about bumping minVersion of muttator to 3.3a1pre, but well i'll probably commit it still
18:23  maxauthority3: dpb: so we could see patches from you? :)
18:23  dpb: maxauthority3: that I doubt, my browsing habits have changed, I haven't installed Vimperator.. <.<
18:23  Segaja: bad boy :D
18:23  maxauthority3: dpb: how did they change?
18:24  maxauthority3: or what would you need from an vimperator++ ?
18:24  maxauthority3: or dpb-browser?
18:24  maxauthority3: dpb: how is the child coming along? and your house?
18:24  Segaja: so many questions...
18:24  dpb: My child is laying in my lap, house is still standing
18:24  Segaja: nice to here about the patch. the next one is still in work
18:25  maxauthority3: Segaja: great :)
18:25  dpb: I use mouse more than before

18:31  Segaja: but for now i have to leanr...
18:31  Segaja: learn..
18:31  maxauthority3: Segaja: probably just look at how :bmarks work. There you have a command which uses the same output for the completions than for the output list
18:32  Segaja: i will do when i have the time
18:32  Segaja: i'm starting to get some orientation in the vimperator source code
