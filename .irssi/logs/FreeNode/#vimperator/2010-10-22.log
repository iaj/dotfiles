16:19  dpb: maxauthority1: uu
16:25  dpb: maxauthority1: just a pity it uses gecko :P
17:16  maxauthority1: gecko2 is really fine
17:16  maxauthority1: it feels really snappy
17:18  maxauthority1: http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/macbook-air-all-substance-no-flash/ - yeah! even if i don't like apple, they are doin  one more step to get rid off flash for ALL users hopefully
17:19 @gkatsev: the new MBAirPad should be half the price, or at least 3/4th
17:58  Segaja: maxauthority1: ping

18:26 --- GGLucas` is now known as GGLucas
18:42  dpb: maxauthority2: and still is a horrible memory hog
18:49 @gkatsev: get more memory :P
18:50  dpb: bleh, 1gb is plenty :)
18:50 @gkatsev: lol
18:50 @gkatsev: not for running a VM inside the host
18:51 @gkatsev: also, not for gecko
19:34  maxauthority2: dpb: lol
19:35  maxauthority2: are you really using 1gb only or was that a joke?
19:38  dpb: Yes, this machine has 1gb of ram.
19:48  maxauthority2: wow
19:48 @gkatsev: I wish my phone had more RAM :( also, more internal storage.
19:49 @gkatsev: i guess, 512MB RAM on my evo is enough, for most things
19:56  maxauthority2: internal storage sucks on my htc desire too. it has 512mb, but actually usable is about 100MB or the like, too much htc crap on it Ã–)
19:56  maxauthority2: :(
19:56  maxauthority2: and you can't get rid of most of that :(
19:56  maxauthority2: i am really looking for a stock android device, but there isn't anyone apart from the n1 :(
19:56 @gkatsev: maxauthority2: root it and install cyanogenmod
19:59  maxauthority2: it might be better now, but didn't you loose all google apps with a custom rom, as they were not licensed?
19:59  maxauthority2: i mean like gmail (which is fortunately on the market now)
20:00 @gkatsev: you use an app to back everything up.
20:00 @gkatsev: titanium backup
20:00 @gkatsev: it backs up everything include google's proprietary apps
20:00 @gkatsev: also, since you have froyo, you should be able to move some apps to the SDcard
20:01  maxauthority2: right, but i think the registration of the app is still on the rom, it's just for saving space
20:01  maxauthority2: at least often when i do 'move to sdcard' not the total space gets freed up
20:02 @gkatsev: it depends on the apps
20:02  maxauthority2: but well, as long as htc keeps updating the roms quite quickly (froyo was max. 1 month behind n1), i don't really care so much
20:02  maxauthority2: but let's wait and see if it gets 3.0
20:02 @gkatsev: gingerbread may actually end up being 2.3
20:03  maxauthority2: and since i replaced most htc apps with custom ones (especially the launcher), the htc sense is not the problem anymore, more the missing free space
20:03  maxauthority2: oh?
20:03  maxauthority2: ok
20:03 @gkatsev: yeah, I don't think it really matters
20:03 @gkatsev: but google lead us to believe that gingerbread was 3.0
20:04 @gkatsev: but it never said so officially
20:04  maxauthority2: i use launcher pro, quite a cool home replacement app
20:04 @gkatsev: i actually like sense
20:04 @gkatsev: I like the weather widget
20:04 @gkatsev: though, I HATE that the launcher doesn't rotate
20:04  maxauthority2: i think it a) wastes much too much space and b) all apps are ever laggier in scrolling than other non-sense ones
20:04  maxauthority2: just try to scroll a long list in your sms app, and you'll see how it sucks
20:05  maxauthority2: and i HATE the rotating launcher feature in launcher pro and disable that immediately :)
20:05 @gkatsev: lol, well, on my evo, I have the kickstand
20:05 @gkatsev: so, it's annoying
20:05  maxauthority2: ah, right
20:05  maxauthority2: anyway, need to get some food
20:05  maxauthority2: bbl
20:06 @gkatsev: k
20:06  maxauthority2: (and working again on the new vimperator command line theme :)

23:17  dv-: ff4 tab groups suck so much
23:17  dv-: likewise ff4 sync
23:17  Dark_Ebola: haven't tried ff4 sync (don't even know what it is?)
23:18  Dark_Ebola: I like the tab group concept, but it's f*cking slow with all those pan/zoom crap
23:19 @gkatsev: Dark_Ebola: ff sync is bookmark sync, i think. Use to be weave, i think.
23:19 @gkatsev: Dark_Ebola: you could probably change the time for the zooming to be like 0.01 seconds so it is essentially instant.
23:20  Dark_Ebola: ah, I don't even use bookmarks ... so ... :)
23:20 @gkatsev: you dont?
23:20  Dark_Ebola: nope
23:20 @gkatsev: I keep my most used websites bookmarked and keyworded
23:20  Dark_Ebola: most used sites are opened in tabs and never closed :D
23:20  Dark_Ebola: I really don't go with less than ~50 tabs
23:20 @gkatsev: I only keep gmail open 24/7
23:21 @gkatsev: I try to keep tabs open as little as possible
23:21 @gkatsev: brb
23:22  dv-: i've switched from gmail web interface to mutt
23:26  Dark_Ebola: hmm, well, I tried to bump the maxVersion to 4.0b8pre in the install.rdf
23:26  Dark_Ebola: make clean && make xpi
23:26  Dark_Ebola: but firefox still complains it's not compatible
23:26  Dark_Ebola: I'm probably missing something
23:33 @gkatsev: :set! extensions.checkCompatibility=false or something like that
23:36  maxauthority2: gkatsev: what broken?
23:36  Dark_Ebola: gkatsev : can't find anything that looks like it.
23:36  maxauthority2: yeah, ff4 tab groups are really buggy, and if i like them, i could also use windows imho
23:37  maxauthority2: Dark_Ebola: hmm, maybe i uped the maxversion on day after that snapshot
23:37  maxauthority2: Segaja will probably create a new one or you can set checkCompatibility=false, but please google yourself howto
23:37  Dark_Ebola: maxauthority2 : I tried upping the version myself (I cloned the repo), I seem to fail somewhere
23:38  maxauthority2: Dark_Ebola: a) you have to create that key and b) it's ...checkCompatibility.4.0b=false
23:39  maxauthority2: hmm, i am still not totally sure about the best selection color, currently i am aiming for #FFEC8B, but there might be better ones
23:40  maxauthority2: any suggestions?
23:42  Dark_Ebola: maxauthority2 : thx, I finally got it working :o , I can be slow sometimes :)
23:45  maxauthority2: good
23:45  maxauthority2: please give comments, as we are currently performing quite a lot of changes to the core interface elements
23:46  Dark_Ebola: from the 30 secs I've used, I miss the [+-] in the bottom bar, maybe a known bug?
23:46  maxauthority2: a known 'feature'
23:47  iaj: dv-: is mutt working fine with gmail imap?
23:47  maxauthority2: because we show the toolbar by default now (we should set it to small icons) for the space we freed with the statusline
23:47  maxauthority2: and the toolbar has all those features like +- visible
23:47  maxauthority2: also even more (like rss and security information)
23:48  Dark_Ebola: ah, I hate toolbars, I removed it :o
23:48  maxauthority2: sure, no problem. one can still do that
23:48  maxauthority2: but then no +- :)
23:49  Dark_Ebola: I want my [+-] without toolbar :P
23:49  Dark_Ebola: <= annoying luser
23:50  dv-: iaj: yes
23:50  Dark_Ebola: tab navigation doesn't seem to take tab groupping into account too, using gt/gT sometimes switches groups in the middle of it.
23:55  maxauthority2: Dark_Ebola: the way the new status field to the right is designed makes it really easy to make a plugin which adds the [+-] back
23:57  Dark_Ebola: good to know
23:58  maxauthority2: the idea is to focus on less things but do those better
23:58  maxauthority2: so rather less features, but those should have less bugs and more polished
23:59  Dark_Ebola: can't go against that, I advocate it on a daily basis :)
