02:07  zong_sharo: is there any plans to make vimperator tab spaces aware?
02:07  zong_sharo: *tab groups
02:36 @gkatsev: zong_sharo: well, vimp tabs are just ff tabs, so, technincally, it is built-in already. But work is in progress to tie the buffer lists and tab numberings and all that with the tab groups
02:37  zong_sharo: yup that's what i mean
02:37 @gkatsev: :)
02:37  zong_sharo: becuase now hitting ^n will probably switch you from tab group to group
02:38  zong_sharo: unless you aware of original, not groupped order - this behaviour looks almost random
02:38  zong_sharo: for how long this will be wip
02:38  zong_sharo: ?
02:41 @gkatsev: Not sure, sorry.
02:42 @gkatsev: max and Segaja probably know more about right now.
02:47  zong_sharo: well, i'm asking because i cannot find any bugs on googlecode
02:48 @gkatsev: So, ctrl-n just goes through all the tabs in order regardless of the grouping?
02:57  zong_sharo: gkatsev: yup
02:58 @gkatsev: weird
02:58  zong_sharo: i suppose it's uses original order, and does not takes into account how groupping alters it
02:58 @gkatsev: zong_sharo: which version of vimp are you using?
02:58  zong_sharo: 4.0b8,vimperator latest  installed couple of days ago
02:58 @gkatsev: and which version of ff?
02:58 @gkatsev: latest vimp as in nightlies?
02:58  zong_sharo: if you can tell me how to obtain more detailed version info i can give it to you
02:59 @gkatsev: :version
02:59 @gkatsev: :)
02:59  zong_sharo: Vimperator:3.0pre (created: 2010/11/23 23:30:53)
02:59  zong_sharo:                         
02:59  zong_sharo:                         Firefox:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101206 Firefox/4.0b8pre
02:59 @gkatsev: ok
02:59 @gkatsev: and no bug reports in gcode?
03:00 @gkatsev: Mind submitting one?
03:00  zong_sharo: does it latest-latest or i should upgrade already?
03:00 @gkatsev: Not sure, you could try a newer nightly and see if it is fixed but probably not.
03:00 @gkatsev: Submit a bug anyway
03:01 @gkatsev: oh, does regular ctrl-tab work fine?
03:01  zong_sharo: nope
03:02 @gkatsev: even ctrl-tab ignores tab grouping?
03:02 @gkatsev: hm...
03:02  zong_sharo: yup
03:03  zong_sharo: let me check on a clean profile
03:03  zong_sharo: that's weird
03:04 @gkatsev: same with a clean profile?
03:04  zong_sharo: on a clear profile it's works okay
03:04  zong_sharo: bah, probably some other extension does that
03:05  zong_sharo: bartab maybe?
03:05 @gkatsev: maybe, don't know.
03:05  zong_sharo: well, anyway
03:05  zong_sharo: thank you for considering me
03:05 @gkatsev: no problem.
03:05 @gkatsev: If you narrow it down some more would be great
03:06  zong_sharo: okay, will do it now
03:14  zong_sharo: well, vimperator is the only addon that triggers such benaviour
03:14  zong_sharo: but only on my main profile
03:14  zong_sharo: on on any new profile
03:15 @gkatsev: try removing or renaming the ~/.vimperator folder and see if the same occurs
03:19  zong_sharo: yup, not-reproducable on a new profile
03:21 @gkatsev: on same profile, does the problem go away with a renamed ~/.vimperator folder?
03:21  zong_sharo: oh wait
03:21 @gkatsev: (make sure to restart after a rename)
03:21  zong_sharo: i reproduced it
03:21  zong_sharo: even after i moved ~/.vimperator and ~/.vimperatorrc
03:22 @gkatsev: but still works fine in new profiles?
03:22  zong_sharo: nope
03:22  zong_sharo: i reproduced it in new profile
03:22 @gkatsev: ok
03:22 @gkatsev: submit a bug :)
03:22  zong_sharo: will investigate further and will submit bug afterwards
03:22 @gkatsev: cool, thanks.
03:25  zong_sharo: yup
03:25  zong_sharo: it's vimperator specific
03:26  zong_sharo: start new profile, install vimperator-latest, restart, open 4 tabs, move second and last to the other group
03:27  zong_sharo: then ^-tab switch will toss you from one group to another
03:27 @gkatsev: ok. Can you submit this on google code? Thanks!
03:27  zong_sharo: sorry, didn't understand how i failed to spot in on the first run on new profle
03:28  zong_sharo: s/didn't/cannot/
03:39  zong_sharo: hm, how should i do title the bug?
03:40 @gkatsev: Um... Tab Switching Ignores Tab Grouping?
03:41  zong_sharo: looks good
03:41  zong_sharo: thx
03:41 @gkatsev: np
03:42  zong_sharo: http://code.google.com/p/vimperator-labs/issues/detail?id=480 <- done
03:43  zong_sharo: good enough?
03:43 @gkatsev: yeah
03:43  zong_sharo: sweet
03:43 @gkatsev: maxauthority2: Segaja: ^
03:45  zong_sharo: btw, i cannot resist to express my admiration of the support that #vimperator provides
03:45  zong_sharo: good job
03:45 @gkatsev: I try :)
03:47  zong_sharo: in rare cases when i got any vimperator issue, this channel proves to be very helpful, every time
03:49  zong_sharo: i suppose #vimperator and #haskell are best channels i'm aware of so far
08:26  maxauthority2: gkatsev: zong_sharo: known bug, but since I don't use tab groups, my motivation is quite low currently to fix these things :(
08:26  maxauthority2: thanks for the bug report though!
08:29  maxauthority2: we should probably just let ctrl-tab do the original meaning. I think it's mapped to 'gt' in vimp
08:39  dpb: maxauthority2: did you see this? http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/A-Conversations-view-for-Thunderbird-1149630.html
09:13  zong_sharo: maxauthority2: i failed to mention this in bug report, but ^n behaves the same
09:47 --- clizzin_ is now known as clizzin
11:04  Segaja: zong_sharo: AFAIK there are plans to make vimp panorama aware
11:50  zong_sharo: Segaja: good to know, can i ask how soon it will be?
11:55  Segaja: zong_sharo: i don't know that
11:55  zong_sharo: okay
11:59  zong_sharo: btw guys, i'm kinda of person who is capable of doing random small contributions. i'm sound in js, don't like it much, but can tolerate. but almost complete lack of documentation along with quite complex moz infrastructure makes cost for a small contributions is quite prohibitive
12:00  zong_sharo: umm, need to clarify - moz docs are okay, vimperator docs not so good
12:24  dpb: vimperator is mostly just javascript, so should be easy for you to understand the code
13:36  addikt1ve: hi :)
13:36  addikt1ve: I assume some of you here are using pentadactyl; since I can't find any pentadactyl channel
13:36  addikt1ve: is the extension broken following fx4b7 update?
13:51  mikem: hi, how can I use bookmarlets with vimperator? can I assign them to a custom command somehow?
17:39  Hrym: Hi! I tried the new vimperator version 3.0pre, and when I do for example ":o google search..." The suggestions-window is basicly half the firefox-window. In v. 2.3.1 I only got that window when I manually pressed tab, and it was just a few rows hight (as high as needed). Is it supposed to be like this? If so, is there any options about it? Thanks :)
17:40  Hrym: (Those rows (in 3.0pre) that isn't used is just marked with a tilde (~))
17:48  Segaja: Hrym: i think maxauthority3 is the person who can answer you that
17:50  Hrym: Segaja: Ok
17:50  Hrym: Segaja: Means that I should highlight, or just wait for him to read? It's not really urgent. :)
17:51  Segaja: wait for him to read
17:51  Hrym: ok
17:51  Segaja: if you see him active and not reponding to this lines than ask him directly
17:52  Hrym: Ok, will do. Thanks
17:54 --- garbas is now known as garbas|away

19:04  maxauthority4: dpb: i am using the conversation view and it's awesome!
19:04  maxauthority4: zong_sharo: yeah @ctrl-n, i know
19:05  maxauthority4: zong_sharo: and this would be a first great step for a small contribution, if you can fix 'gt' etc. for panorama :)
19:05  maxauthority4: Hrym: :set noautocomplete and it should be like in vimp 2.3
19:06  maxauthority4: Hrym: and the ~ were used for vimp compatibility, maybe we can get rid of it, but it's not easy as we tried to avoid changing the completion box height too often
19:09  Hrym: maxauthority4: Ok, thanks! noautocomplete did the trick. (Stuoid me thought you were supposed to wroite autocomplete=false ^^). But about the height. When I do "o google<tab>" (with noautocomplete set) those ~ doesn't appear. ^^
19:10  maxauthority4: we should reall add :set booloption=false instead of just nobooloption
19:11  maxauthority4: Hrym: if you do :o google<tab>notexisting<tab> you should see the ~ as well
19:12  maxauthority4: as the completion list just gets higher, not smaller
19:14  Hrym: ok
19:14  Segaja: hi martin
