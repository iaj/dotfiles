13:17  Segaja: maxauthority4: as soon as i have recreated my 30+ tabs i will try to find the cause
13:17  maxauthority4: ok
13:17  Segaja: the problem will be to disable plugins, because i don't have the menu bar and :dia is not working here
13:17  aksr: Segaja, i compiled, yesterday, with the commented "static"...tabopen isn't woking
13:18  Segaja: what do you mean by "compiled"?
