10:04  xintron: I get an exception when trying to open my editor runing firefox 4.0b8pre and latest hg-build of vimperator. Is this something that's known to be working or have I got it missconfigured?

10:08  Segaja: i think you are not the first one who has problems with external editor in vimp3.0pre
10:08  xintron: ah, good to know. Then I won't bother with trying to get it to work
11:52  me_: Hi again. How to disable about complition during opening site in vimperator 3.0pre?
11:57  me_: *auto
11:58  Utopiah: I guess :set complete
12:11  me_: Utopiah, I will try that out. Thank you.
12:13  me_: Utopiah, Well the screen still keeps poping up on whole screen while trying to open www adress. Any other suggestions?
12:15  Utopiah: :h options
12:16  me_: Utopiah, ok thanks again.
12:17  Utopiah: np
14:17  maxauthority: Segaja: thanks for the link. Do you have the time to implement the changes in vimp? :)
19:03  Segaja: maxauthority1: don't know. i haven't really looked at the changes
19:04  Segaja: i would diff their version against ours
20:16  Segaja: maxauthority1: if i do it we might have to update the Â© lines again
20:59  Segaja: maxauthority1: that could become a bigger patch as there fix is, because they seem to have changed some stuff before
21:26  maxauthority1: i don't think we can use it 1:1, but using the stuff should be fine IMHO
21:27  Segaja: we can't
21:27  Segaja: i just tried to modify common/content/buffer.js but it doesn't work
21:27  Segaja: the problem it is seems that this is only a last change in dactyl to make it work
21:27  Segaja: we would have to track what else they changed
21:28  Segaja: an i must say that sounds a bit too tedious
21:28  Segaja: as much as i would love to see the help bug vanish, i don't think i'm the person to deliver it atm
21:33  maxauthority1: ok
21:33  Segaja: but feel free to try, you might have more luck :)
21:33  Segaja: or we wait for the bugs to get fixed
21:34  Segaja: or we (= someone) re-rewrite the help system
21:47  maxauthority1: yeah, although xml + xslt isn't that bad either
