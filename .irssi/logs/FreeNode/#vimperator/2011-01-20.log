15:27  dr_spork: Has anyone here gotten Muttator to work recently? I'm having difficulty getting the plugin to install--tried three versions of Thunderbird and three versions of Muttator and it still says it's incompatible

20:01  Segaja: indietrash: no. vimperator does not look much at the page itself. and it doesn't act illogically
20:01  Segaja: it acts normally, that it is in the default mode
20:02 --- Channel #vimperator was synced in 82 seconds
20:16  indietrash: Segaja: is there a mode to interact with pages such as these?
20:19  Segaja: PASS THROUGH
20:20 @gkatsev: mode
20:20 --- gkatsev sets modes [#vimperator -o gkatsev]
20:20  gkatsev: did the keybindings for it get changed in vimp3?
20:26  Segaja: what do you mean?
21:21  maxauthority1: gkatsev: not yet, but they will. at least in vimp 3.x not sure about 3.0

22:59  gkatsev: ok, cool
23:01  Segaja: maxauthority1: it might be an idea to do this in vimp 3.0 so that major changes are in a major version number
23:01  gkatsev: that is a good point
23:01  gkatsev: has it been decided on what the new key combos will be?
23:01  Segaja: not to my knowledge
23:02  Segaja: i also would say some basic panorama support should be added to vimp3.0
