14:26  rsFF: hello there
14:26  rsFF: one question
14:26  rsFF: for example
14:26  rsFF: when i yank some website
14:26  rsFF: ie
14:27  rsFF: http://www.getacoder.com/projects/solve p vs np_132036.html
14:27  rsFF: it does not copy the %20
14:27  rsFF: is there any shortcut to copy in the correct format
14:31  TheBrayn: are there any vimperator scripts that can close all tabs right or left of a tab
15:07  murosai_: is it possible to mark tags by letter and then switch to them using the letter?
15:07  murosai_: mark tabs i mean
16:25  murosai_: anyone here uses tree style tabs addon?
16:25  Tux^verdreifelt: i use tabkit with treestyle tabs option..
16:26  Zambezi: Tux^verdreifelt: Tried Tree Style Tab?
16:26  Tux^verdreifelt: yep, but didn't really like it back then
16:27  Zambezi: Tux^verdreifelt: Opposite here.
16:27  Tux^verdreifelt: well i was in the process of tidying up my firefox
16:27  murosai_: hm, i wonder how can i map keys to say "close this tab tree"
16:27  Tux^verdreifelt: decided to drop tabmix plus
16:27  Tux^verdreifelt: :)
16:27  Zambezi: I'm looking forward to Vimperator working with Fx4.0b.
16:30  Tux^verdreifelt: hmm :) once it does, there's 4.1 anyway
16:42  dpb: Zambezi: the snapshots have worked in 4 beta quite a while already
16:47  Zambezi: dpb: Then I have to grab a snapshot then.
16:49  dpb: But do note that the vimperator to come is quite different from previous ones.
17:07  Tux^verdreifelt: so is the upcoming firefox.
18:20  murosai_: how do you guys search and open bookmarks, just :marks and ;o?
18:20  murosai_: :bmarks

18:57 @gkatsev: yes
18:58 @gkatsev: Daneel: bmarks
18:58  Daneel: :bmarks {filter}<CR> then ;o to open, though, usually it is easier to just use the bookmark completions of :open and :tabopen
19:19  murosai_: yeah but it's kind of slow, its not like im always going to search the bookmarks when i type :open

20:16  me_: Hi all. I was wandering how to map keys so the 'f' would initiate hint mode (default) but also abort it (as ESC does) once I will change my mind and decide not to use any link.
20:19  maxauthority4: hmm, not possible i think
20:19  maxauthority4: we don't yet support mappings in HINT mode
20:23  me_: Thank You for answer.
20:23  me_: Bye.
20:23  maxauthority4: bye
20:46 @gkatsev: fmap?
20:46  maxauthority4: fmap is a plugin
20:47  maxauthority4: used to pass only certain keys to web pages
20:47  maxauthority4: very useful and i think something like this will become a default vimp 3 feature
20:47 @gkatsev: no, i mean as a name for the hint mode mappings
20:47 @gkatsev: though, I guess hmap would be better
20:50  maxauthority4: well, the plan is rather to replace it with :map -modes=hint ...
20:51  maxauthority4: is much more flexible and since such mappings are usually just written once (in a rc file) the few more characters don't really hurt
20:52 @gkatsev: ah
20:52  maxauthority4: and (if we keep TEXTAREA), things like :map -modes=insert,textarea certainly make often sense
20:52 @gkatsev: that works
20:53 @gkatsev: though, we should probably keep like nmap and cmap and stuff as mappings, or do you want to get rid of that?
20:54  maxauthority4: well, actually i want but doesn't necessarily have to be for 3.0
20:54  maxauthority4: i am really annoyed by our clobbering of the main : namespace
20:55  maxauthority4: (as i was with git-foo commands until they finally started to only have 'git foo' at some time
20:56  maxauthority4: it just takes away so much of the complexity if you have good tab completion, and have 10 commands with 10 subcommands each, instead of 100 top level commands. Much easier to learn and probably even remember, and the really often used things should mostly be mappings anyway
20:56 @gkatsev: yeah
20:56 @gkatsev: which is why I prefer vim over emacs
20:56  maxauthority4: and if not...  tab completion also works better with feewer commands
20:57  maxauthority4: e.g. :macro and :macros and such thigns are really bad for tab completion
21:00  maxauthority4: so the idea is to only have top-level commands like "macros", "commands", "bookmarks" which all have sub commands like ":bookmarks add ..." so we can group related functionality together in a single top level command
21:01 @gkatsev: maxauthority4: perhaps we should force custom commands to start with capital letters now, then?
21:01 @gkatsev: like in vim?
21:01  maxauthority4: and i'll make sure that we can use :bo<tab>a<tab>
21:02  maxauthority4: gkatsev: no! sorry, but really no :) Reason is that i think with the new "meta commands" plugins are even better supported. So people should write a "cookies.vimp" plugin which just adds a single ":cookies" command which does all usefull stuff for cookies
21:02  maxauthority4: i don't see why plugins should feel like a 2nd class citizen
21:03 @gkatsev: maxauthority4: well, you were just talking about poluting the : namespace, so... :P
21:07  maxauthority4: and why is that less poluted (to the end user) if we capitize plugin commands?
22:12  Segaja: hi maxauthority4
22:12  Segaja: did you see my line?
