18:40  ChrisBuchholz: I guys, i am just trying out vimperator, but are having a hard to getting the bookmarks left-side panel to show. Is vimperator blocking the keybinding, and is there another way to do it with vimperator?
18:45  w__: ChrisBuchholz: you cant use that in vimperator
18:45  w__: but you can still open it with :dialogue bookmarks
18:45  ChrisBuchholz: w__: okay, thanks

21:26  Dynetrekk: is there a fast way to copy the current URL into the clipboard?
21:27  Segaja: y
21:27  Segaja: Daneel: yank
21:27  Daneel: y is for yanking current URL. Y is for yanking currently selected text.  Use ;y to yank the URL of a link.
21:28  Dynetrekk: interesting, I'll have a go at it
21:28  Dynetrekk: I guess I should think less and vim more
21:31  Segaja: hehe
21:31  Segaja: after all it is called VIMperator
