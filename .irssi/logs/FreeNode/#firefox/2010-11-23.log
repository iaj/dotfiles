04:15  wrb123: i have a serious problem: i accidentally deleted the style.css file for my site from my server. i still have my site open in firefox - by any chance does firefox cache this whole style.css file somewhere, so that i can get it through firebug or in memory somewhere? :(
04:25 @kbrosnan: wrb123: check about:cache
04:28  wrb123: thanks!

05:19  OvermindDL1: Would anyone happen to know where to download a build of the Ubiquity 0.6.1pre extension?
05:26 @kbrosnan: OvermindDL1: https://bitbucket.org/satyr/ubiquity/downloads
05:30  OvermindDL1: tip.xpi?
05:30 --- Tannn3r is now known as Tannn3r|away
05:30 @kbrosnan: yes, you will need to manually install it
05:31  OvermindDL1: That is fine I know how, just on a system that does not have a python system on it so I cannot build it myself, thanks much!
05:31  OvermindDL1: Hard to use the browser on foreign systems without Ubiquity nowadays....
05:32 --- Tannn3r|away is now known as Tannn3r
05:33 @kbrosnan: it is a community project now. i don't think there will be any more updates directly from mozilla
05:33  OvermindDL1: That is too bad, was really hoping it would end up built inside of Firefox someday...

07:29  micols: where do you make suggestions for future firefox releases?
07:29  GarrettW: bugzilla
07:30  micols: I would like an easy way to change browser version string, I think there was something like this in newer firefox perhaps
07:30  Cork: micols: http://hendrix.mozilla.org/
07:30  Cork: micols: btw there is a ton of extensions that does that
07:31  GarrettW: yeah, look for "user agent switcher"
07:32  GarrettW: on https://addons.mozilla.org/
07:32  micols: yeah, I already have that addon, it isn't very nice with vimperator :)
07:33  micols: so I suggested it into firefox, who knows.. perhaps they might add it (as it increases your private life when people cannot see your browser version, os version etc)
07:33  Cork: micols: a warning though, firefox is actually rather going in the oposit directionm locking down the agent string
07:33  Cork: (removing stuff from it and making it less customizable)
07:33  Cork: *direction,
07:34  micols: hm ok, I suggested a way of toggling it , instead of using about:config for it
07:34  micols: after all my netbanking segfaults (java) when I remove my user agent :-) , so it might be needed in some places
07:35  Cork: micols: you can always sugest it, but as its an option most users don't use, it most likly won't be accepted
07:35  micols: syncing isn't used by many users either
07:35  micols: but it made it into firefox4
07:35  Cork: micols: mozillas policy has always been to keep the gui as simple as posible
07:35  Cork: micols: it is
07:35  Cork: micols: it actually has quite a large user base

Please refresh the page." and "Your changes cannot be saved because of a problem with the network connection. Access will be restored when you re-establish your connection." but my connection is fine elsew
10:52  LaraX: here and on this page it says Firefox 3.0 is supported: http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=37560 . does this work for anyone else?

11:14  swoody: I am running 64bit Debian and just installed the latest 4.0 Beta release (which is 32bit) I am now trying to get the flash plugin working, but am having a tough time... Can anyone lend me some advice?
11:15  swoody: I have tried both 32 bit and 64 bit version of the plugin and I can get FF to recognize it as a plugin, but I can't get either version to work with actual webpages
12:10 @kbrosnan: swoody: make sure there is only one version of the flash plugin present. clean up gnash, swdefc, ~/.mozilla/plugins
12:10 @kbrosnan: only 32 bit flash will work in 32 bit firefox
