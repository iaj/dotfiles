06:07  lanoxx: can i use the tb3 profile with tb2, or will this create problems?
06:09  iam8up: has anyone set up a custom weave server for the firefox sync addon?  i believe I have the server ready to go and configured, but the addon wants me to specify a URL for the custom server - i tried https://foo.bar.com and while I can see the html pages that url isn't acceptable to the addon
06:09  lanoxx: im thinking to upgrade tb2 to tb3, but on other computers at access the same profile from the server there is still tb3 installed

11:36  freakynl: hi anyone know if there's a target for these? https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Feature_Brainstorming:Printing Was hoping v4 is going to improve printing a lot (especially on linux, on windows I can always revert to yuck yuck IE)
11:54  Karen_m: all of a sudden, my middle mouse wheel is now zoom in/zoom out instead of scroll up and down.  How do I revert this?
11:54  Karen_m: please and thanks
12:13  auscompgeek: Karen_m: your mouse driver is at fault

15:07  fruitwerks: hey all, ff 3.6.10 win7 - this happened yesterday as well, I can't get an ip for a certain site, but IE can, any idea why this would happen?
15:08  Tu13es: hm, CPU usage jumps a ton when scrolling, any idea why?
15:08  fruitwerks: Tu13es, low-end graphics card / bad drivers?
15:09  Tu13es: fruitwerks: nope, 9500gt with newest drivers
15:09  fruitwerks: all pages or just pages with flash or lots of fancy stuff?
15:09  Tu13es: all pages, i think
15:09  Tu13es: lemme check a text one
15:10  fruitwerks: this one is nice an plain http://www.ibdhost.com/help/html/
15:10  fruitwerks: what ff ver and what add-ons do you have?
15:11  Tu13es: it still happens on the text-only page, but moreso on a page with stuff on it
15:11  Tu13es: ff4b6 atm, let me make sure it happens in 3
15:12 * fruitwerks would say probably blame it on beta :D
15:12  Tu13es: ah, yeah, frig. it still happens in ff3 but less so
15:12 * Tu13es stabs the beta
15:12  fruitwerks: interesting
15:13  fruitwerks: was ff4 still open when you tried 3x?
15:13  Tu13es: yep
15:13  fruitwerks: close 4 and try 3x again
15:14  Tu13es: oh, huh, that helped.
15:14  qwd: Is there a key for making a picture in Firefox larger? I'm talking about when you open a .jpg and it's scaled to fit the screen.
15:16  fruitwerks: Tu13es, visit this site and play the video in v3 and 4v seperately, check your cpu use while idle and while scrolling with the ideo playing fr both http://flowplayer.org/tools/toolbox/flashembed.html
15:19  fruitwerks: probably not the best test these days lol.. you may see a huge difference though, depends how ff4 renders, it might not be tapped into full hardware support yet *shrug* other than that I have no idea, deal with it - it's beta, file a feedback / bug report or something I guess
15:20  Tu13es: aye aye
15:20  Tu13es: thanks
15:21  fruitwerks: hmm
15:22  fruitwerks: good luck dude(?) - thanks all

16:54  Milp_main: Hi everyone, im looking for a way to reload a cached copy of a page instead of completely redownloading all of it again after i restarted firefox and reloaded the previous tab session, how could i do this?
16:55  Milp_main: If it reloads the page after a restart thats horrible, both performance and traffic wise. And the goddamn youtube videos start playing again. I hate having to find the one youtube video within 150 tabs
17:03  goltoof_: any ay to orce some tabs to stay open.. ie, 4 tabs that stay open no matter what ?
17:03  goltoof_: *way to force
17:59  frostburn: Has anyone seen firefox not correctly handle requests to msdn?  e.g. going to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394597%28v=VS.85%29.aspx causes a  Unable to Service Request page to appear, with no plugins enabled.  The site renders fine in chromium and my coworkers pc using the same version of firefox
18:02  frostburn: i take that back, i'm running 86_64 build, he's running i686
