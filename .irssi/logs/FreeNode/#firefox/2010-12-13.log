08:56  BlueG: when given video sources in the order mp4, webm, ogv, Firefox 4b7 and Minefield seem to be falling back to ogv instead of playing the webm file. Why is this?
09:01 --- LaraWeb is now known as LaraCloud
09:11  sedulous: skipping MP4 if there's an OGV makes sense because MP4 is less free
09:11  Cork: i don't think firefox supports mp4 actually
09:11  Cork: not sure why i would skipp webm though

11:10  chadi: Hello guys. Is it possible to make firefox call an external application using javascript (greasemonkey)? If this feature isn't available for everyone, can I make it available only for me, through a specific addon, for example.
11:12 @Peng: It is possible, though I do not remember the details. I don't know if Greasemonkey scripts have the rights to do it, though.
11:14  chadi: They don't... I jsut want to know if there is a way for them to do so. what I can do the most is alert(), however, I want a sound alert, which is only possible through an external app

14:17  razieliyo: hi
14:18  razieliyo: I'm getting problems installing delicious in iceweasel
14:18  razieliyo: since there's no iceweasel channel, I came here
14:19  Cork: razieliyo: depending on your problem, the correct channel might be the debian channel
14:19  Cork: but explain your problem
15:09  rothwell: 'lo. anyone got mathml rendering working in firefox? it seems as though it's working for some pages, but I can't get trivial examples like 'http://waste.corolla.ath.cx/2010/12/13/z.html' to render correctly (I never see any parens with mfenced, for example)
15:10  rothwell: i'm using https://www.eyeasme.com/Joe/MathML/MathML_browser_test as a reference, which seems to render correctly...
15:12  mbn_18: Hi, Im adding code to a site which implant the canonical tag to each page. Is there extension that enable me to show the tag while browsing from page to page?
15:20  eagles0513875: hey guys
15:51 @kbrosnan: mbn_18: if you mean rel link stuff then https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933/
16:01  MxReb0: anyone else firefox 4?
16:02  MxReb0: you know that link url preview that normally shows at the bottom when you hover over a link?
16:02  MxReb0: in ff4 for me it does that in the address bar instead of showing at the bottom now. Is that normal function?
16:03 @kbrosnan: yes
16:04  MxReb0: is there a way to chage that back?
16:05 @kbrosnan: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/235283/
16:05  MxReb0: it's pretty bad for me because 1. it's showing that text in light green and I can't read it, 2. my address bar's really short and I can't read it all
16:05  MxReb0: that looks good
16:06  MxReb0: now if I could just get autocopy for ff4
16:07  MxReb0: so I can get unix /xwindows style highlighting for copy/paste
16:08 @kbrosnan: try flipping middlemouse.paste in about:config
16:08  MxReb0: oh that's built in?
16:10  MxReb0: I can still see my autocopy var in there
16:10  MxReb0: guess that only works with the plugin though
16:11  MxReb0: alright, kbrosnan that's cool, but it only turns on paste, I need highlight to copy as well
16:12  MxReb0: clipboard.autocopy doesn't seem to do it whatever that is
16:16 @kbrosnan: might need an extension for that part
16:19  MxReb0: yeah I'm thinking about editing this other guy's source code
16:19  MxReb0: but I should prob work on my own stuff
16:19  ujjain: flash player in firefox sometimes just stops after seconds or minutes... youtube window becomes grey, and bbc player dissappears, what could this be? (fedora core 13)
16:21  MxReb0: are you update to the latest flash player 10.something? I saw a notice for that in fedore 2 days ago
16:21  MxReb0: fedora*
16:22  MxReb0: kbrosnan, is the default color for the url preview really light green? it's so hard to see.
16:22  ujjain: it says shockwave flash 10.1 r102
16:23  MxReb0: that seems right
16:23  MxReb0: what triggers that?
16:23  MxReb0: when did it start, etc
16:24  ujjain: nothing, it just stops
16:24  MxReb0: ok, maybe if you run firefox in a terminal you can see some messages when that happens?
16:24  MxReb0: or switch to your console
16:25  MxReb0: also could be something with you video driver, if that is the case, maybe dmesg can tell you something. what does that say?
16:25 @kbrosnan: MxReb0: it is dependent on your theme
16:25  ujjain: ah, firefox started from terminal
16:25  MxReb0: ok, that makes sense. I changed my theme and it stayed the same so I thought otherwise
16:26  ujjain: will show logs?
16:26  ujjain: are there log fils for firefox in /var/log?
16:26  MxReb0: not in var log
16:26  MxReb0: that's more for system stuff
16:26  MxReb0: your user shouldn't be able to write there anyways
16:26  ujjain: it just stops...middle of the video... or flash clip and youtube turns grey and player dissappears and stops?
16:26  MxReb0: but you will see some gui warnings etc in the term
16:27  MxReb0: do you know if you have selinux running? I have had some problems with firefox and that.
16:29 --- satdav-away is now known as satdav
16:34  ujjain: it is running yes
16:35  ujjain: if you run from command-line
16:35  ujjain: it will print errors
16:35  ujjain: right?
16:39  ujjain: GLib-GIO:ERROR:gdbusconnection.c:2270:initable_init: assertion failed: (connection->initialization_error == NULL)
16:39  ujjain: /usr/lib64/firefox-3.6/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:  6821 Abandon                 (core dumped) "$prog" ${1+"$@"}
16:39  ujjain: when trying to start it from command-line
16:43  ujjain: MxReb0: Do you have advice? I did rpm -Uvh --force for flash rpm, already had latest version
16:43  MxReb0: sec
16:43  satdav: ujjain, what version of firefox you using and issue I will look into that also for you
16:44  MxReb0: so it doesn't start and it gives you that, or it does start ok?
16:45  MxReb0: because it sounds like you could at least run ff a min ago otherwise except for that flash problem
16:45  MxReb0: if this is the case, do "which firefox" and make sure that the path matches the shortcut or whatever you started from
16:45  ujjain: Firefox runs fine from gnome menu
16:46  ujjain: FC13, latest flash, Firefox 3.6.13
16:46  ujjain: up2date OS
16:47  MxReb0: but does not run from your terminal??
16:47  ujjain: no
16:47  MxReb0: no it does, or no it doesn't? lol
16:48  satdav: MxReb0, have you tried safe mode to see if that will fix the issue
16:48  MxReb0: I'm not having the problem satdav
16:48  ujjain: it does not run
16:48  MxReb0: ujjain, it's a problem with your path and symlinks
16:49  MxReb0: update them like I said before using "which firefox" and cross checking from that item in your gnome menu
16:49  MxReb0: that is very simple to do.
16:50  satdav: ujjain, can you try safe mode and what version you using of firefox
16:50  ujjain: safe mode = Windows?
16:50  MxReb0: omg
16:51  ujjain: oh, Firefox safe mode? I am sorry, I did not know there was one
16:51  satdav: thats fine
16:51  ujjain: the flash thing happens from time to time, quite frequently
16:51  ujjain: but sometimes all is fine
16:51  MxReb0: don't mess with safemode. your flash issue is separate from your terminal issue.
16:52  ujjain: /usr/bin/firefox
16:52  ujjain: I agree :)
16:52  ujjain: which firefix -> /usr/bin/firefox
16:52  MxReb0: ok, no what does the menu item have?
16:52  MxReb0: now*
