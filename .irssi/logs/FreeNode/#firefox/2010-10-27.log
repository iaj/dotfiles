15:30  naftilos76: actually i have found something and trying to make it work as we speak
15:31  naftilos76: firefox has to be configured so that a proper app can be chosen to handle this protocol

15:31  pcgenius: so you are talking about MMS

15:54  naftilos76: nothing happens
15:54  pcgenius: same problem
15:54  pcgenius: ?
15:54  naftilos76: you must have some configurations in your firefox about:config
15:55  naftilos76: it doesn't make any sense
15:55  pcgenius: ya i know
15:55  pcgenius: just wait
15:55  naftilos76: do you have anything related to mms in your about:config?

15:57  pcgenius: http://www.cinlug.org/node/316
15:57  pcgenius: check this
15:59  naftilos76: this is exactly what i was reading
15:59  naftilos76: nothing happens
15:59  pcgenius: so about:plugins showing totem
15:59  pcgenius: or not
15:59  naftilos76: i have tried with mplayer and gecko-player installed
15:59  naftilos76: and i tried totem as you indicated
16:00  naftilos76: still no luck
16:00  pcgenius: is totem in your plugins list?
16:01  naftilos76: yes it is
16:02  naftilos76: let me restart again FF
16:03  NullAcht15: Hi, does Firefox use an external (possibly bundled) library for idn support or does it supply its own implementation? Does it support IDNA 2008?
16:05  naftilos76: pcgenius: the only station that plays is "Now" on the right...
16:05  naftilos76: anyway...i get to it later
16:06  naftilos76: i haven't got more time for this
16:06  naftilos76: thanks for your time man
16:07  pcgenius: naftilos76:ok i am searching for it
16:07  Tatsh: i'm running into a sort of bug i suppose where if I enable KDE4's compositing (togglable with alt+shift+F12), then DOM animation is really slow and skips frames
16:08  Tatsh: but as soon as I disable it, DOM animation is normal speed
16:08  Tatsh: i'm on linux, KDE4 + compositing (handled by nvidia binary); so who to blame? :(
16:09  NullAcht15: Tatsh: At a guess, probably the nvidia drivers. I'm using KDE 4 + Firefox with Compmositing (using OpenGL) on three different systems, two with Ati cards, one with an intel card, and I don't see any such problems
16:10  Tatsh: but do you think it's to do with how KDE sets up for compositing with Gtk+?
16:11  Tatsh: i'm also wondering if it could be the theme i use
16:11  NullAcht15: Tatsh: Do you have any examples for websites where this is particularly noticeable?
16:11  Tatsh: well, http://forms.asimdesign.net/cphr-form
16:12  Tatsh: the fade in 'transformation' is slow
16:12  Tatsh: the scrollTo animation upon hitting Next page is also slow
16:12  Tatsh: chromium renders these no problem with compositing enabled
16:13  NullAcht15: Tatsh: Try this: Quit Firefox, mv ~/.mozilla ~/mozilla-backup, restart Firefox, see if the problem persists. This will at least tell you if the problem is with your theme or any other of your personal settings
16:15  Tatsh: clean profile, no problems
16:15  Tatsh: i think it's this (beta) theme i use
16:15  Tatsh: it's a really cool theme but i may have to let it go at least in my developer profile
16:15  Tatsh: it styles the widgets as most themes do but that might be the problem
16:16  NullAcht15: Sucks, but then, there might have been something besides your theme in your profile that caused the slowdown. You may want to experiment for a while to narrow it down
16:17  Tatsh: it's the theme for sure; i have 2 profiles sitting next to each other
16:17  Tatsh: one does the scrollLeft animation very badly (theme enabled)
16:17  Tatsh: default theme is smooth
16:19  Tatsh: i've read about this elsewhere; that background image with background-position:fixed is totally broken in ff
16:19  Tatsh: it's very slow to scroll down because it seems ff is trying to adjust the background back to top center every so often while scrollin
16:19  Tatsh: g
16:21  NullAcht15: Tatsh: By the way, what kind of DOM animation were you referring to? On the example page you gave, I cannot see any animation of any kind...
16:21  Tatsh: ok, here's some JS
16:22  Tatsh: http://erxz.com/pb/paste using jquery
16:24  Tatsh: it's basically the slideDown of jquery effect being done on the fieldset height
16:24  sysRPL: hello
16:24  Tatsh: it's very buggy weird with an option like 'fast' for speed (which i think is 200ms)
16:24  boogie1: How can i configure the proxy server?
16:24  d1b: morning
16:24  d1b: wow so this is where the help is ?
16:25  sysRPL: can someone tell me in this video from the mizllia blog, why do users need to install applications, when the application is merely a web page? http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2010/10/19/prototype-of-an-open-web-app-ecosystem/
16:25  sysRPL: * mozilla blog
16:25  d1b: so there is a hg commit and references the 0day bug in bugzilla, is that a partial or full fix?

16:57  al_admeld: whats the firefox dev room
17:05  wwalker: On OS X , 10.6, firefox 3.6.10, I added a skin/theme whatever it is called.  instructions on the net say Tools-> Themes  select, uninstall.   I don't have "Themes" under any menu that I can find.  Anyone know where it is?  Or how I can just "install" the original theme?
17:06  evilNirvana: wwalker: tools -> addons -> themes
17:07  wwalker: evilNirvana: thank you!
17:07  wwalker: I can read my book marks again !
17:07  evilNirvana: <3

17:11  ramiro: hi, there's an annoying bug bugging me, but I'm still unsure who it belongs to. I have ubuntu 10.04, I open terminal, maximize it. then I open firefox, and maximize it. When I click the X button to close firefox, the click goes through to the X button and closes terminal. This happens with firefox on top of any other program too. and now I just got it again on mandriva linux
17:11  ramiro: can anyone confirm if this is a known firefox bug?
17:12  al_admeld: ramiro: do you have any themes active
17:12  Cork[home]: ramiro: you forgot to mention what version of firefox you have
17:12  ramiro: whatever's default
17:12  ramiro: Cork[home]: oh, of course =). right now on mandriva it's 3.6.10
17:13  Cork[home]: then its xwin
17:13  Cork[home]: or compis
17:13  Cork[home]: *compiz
17:13  ramiro: compiz is not enabled
17:13  Cork[home]: anyway its not cause of firefox, it doesn't do anything with borders in 3.6
17:14  ramiro: Cork[home]: ah, ok, thanks for confirming
17:14  Cork[home]: ramiro: i'm not actually confirming
17:14  Cork[home]: i'm only saying it can't be firefox, as it doesn't touch those elements
17:14  ramiro: hm, I thought you were confirming it's not firefox's fault
17:15  ramiro: as in not in firefox's codebase
17:15  Cork[home]: exactly
17:15  Cork[home]: but confirmin is me testing mandriva without compiz and firefox 3.6.10
17:15  Cork[home]: and that i didn't do
17:16  ramiro: hmm, ok. it's good enough for me though

17:23  ardian: Hello is there any plugin for firefox that allows only 10 sites to visit ?
17:25  al_admeld: ardian: use your computers hosts file
17:25  al_admeld: does anyone know of any tweaks i can do to make FF handle all JS sites a bit better
17:27  ardian: al_admeld: I am running Linux and I thought about a firefox addon
17:27  al_admeld: ardian: just use the hosts file
17:27  al_admeld: ardian: using an addon for that is not practical
17:28  ardian: hmmm You can only block websites with hosts right ?
17:29  al_admeld: allow only, block, redirect
17:49  rdg: I'm having a huge google fail. is there a plugin that'll let me spoof browser client HTTP header info ..
17:49  rdg: I realize I can change it in the about:config or whatever, but I want a point and click noob thing
17:50  Cork[home]: check for useragent switcher
17:50  rdg: useragent.. that's probably what i'm screwing up in my search.. couldn't remember the term. thanks
17:52 @kbrosnan: it won't change the accept header if that is waht you care about
18:02  rdg: apple's mobile.me says my browser is unsupported
18:02  rdg: so I just wanted to forge the client

18:17  NullAcht15: Does Firefox use an external (possibly bundled) library for idn support or does it supply its own implementation? Does it support IDNA 2008?

18:46 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 94 seconds
18:47  NullAcht15: After a domainname with special characters passes the whitelist it will have to be nameprepped and (if it still contains special chars after that), punycoded
18:48  NullAcht15: My question is, how does Firefox do that, does it use libidn, or some other external library, or does it have its own implementation of the fairly complex algorithms required for that?
18:52  NullAcht15: Reason for my asking is that a new revision of the IDN standard, IDNA 2008, was issued two months ago, which changes a few things
19:00 @kbrosnan: NullAcht15: as i understand it mozilla does not do anything special with idn domains either they are on the whitelist or not

19:37  itissid: Where is SVG fnt support in FF as of now?
19:37  itissid: font*
19:38 @kbrosnan: not planned as i recall
19:38  itissid: kbrosnan: Any reason specifically?
19:39  geeknik: itissid: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/SVG_in_Firefox - Shows implementation status.
19:39 @kbrosnan: shttp://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2010/06/not_implementin.html
19:41  itissid: kbrosnan: Dont you think the one of the main idea of SVG is cool scalable fonts.. I mean isnt that kinda imprtant?
19:41 @kbrosnan: my opinion on the matter is irrelavant
19:42  itissid: kbrosnan: Care to share a moment here why?
19:42 @kbrosnan: i am not a moz employee or a layout dev
19:42  itissid: hmm
19:42 @kbrosnan: roc is
19:43  itissid: Well someone could explain why SVG fonts are not cool enough to be in the dev releases?
19:44 @kbrosnan: that blog post covers it. woff > svg fonts
19:44 @kbrosnan: in the layout devs priority
19:45 @kbrosnan: also what you are doing is strang since firefox supports mathml
19:45  NullAcht15: geeknik: Thanks, but no, that wasn't what I'm looking for
19:45 @kbrosnan: latex to mathml seems more of a natural step
19:45  geeknik: It's the only IDN info I could find on the Moz site.
19:46  NullAcht15: Let me rephrase my question one more time
