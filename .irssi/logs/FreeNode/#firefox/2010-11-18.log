12:28  mdw: I'm looking for the right way to embed a HTML page into a pop-up window
12:28  mdw: I've found howto embed HTML elements
12:29  mdw: but what I really need is full HTML, so it behaves like a mini browser window

12:51  gryllida: mdw, use <html:iframe src="http://....."></html:iframe>
12:54  mdw: gryllida: hey
12:54  mdw: I've been using this, but the width and the height elements behave odly in a Window
12:55  mdw: also, it seems to play badly with JQueryUI
12:55  mdw: I'll endeavour to find out solutions
12:55  gryllida: width and the height elements.....? they sound more like attributes or properties
12:55  mdw: as it means I can reuse code from my Chrome extension
12:55  mdw: gryllida: sorry I'm not normally a web developer - this is an odd job I'm doing :)
12:56  gryllida: so you need to try what is behaving oddly again, since I didn't understand
12:57  mdw: is there a way to position the window neatly under the toolbar area in firefox?
12:57  mdw: Chrome does this automatically and it looks nice
12:57  mdw: and also hide the window decorations
12:58  mdw: (minimize/maximize window controls)

13:08  howlymowly: hi poeple..  short question:   is there an add-on for firefox that lets me move the browser window when clicking on "empty space" besides the tabs? similar to the chrome browser functionality
13:19 --- bh-off is now known as boonhead
13:24  gryllida: howlymowly, hm
13:24  howlymowly: I actually just changed back from chrome to firefox 4.0 ^^  that's the nly thing, I am missing
13:25  gryllida: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/77700/ is similar
13:27  gryllida: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/95984/ too
13:27  gryllida: Hide the Titlebar of your browser windows.
13:27  gryllida: You can move or maximize the browser window by dragging or double clicking on the blank place of toolbars. You can also drag with right-click at Minimize/Maximize/Close buttons to move window.
13:28  randomparticle: how does firefox specify the server-side address of sockets?
13:28  randomparticle: apparently it's not by using 'connect(...)'
13:28  gryllida: O.O
13:29  gryllida: Where are you trying to run that?
13:29  randomparticle: i'm analyzing connections using dtrace
13:30  howlymowly: thx gryllida those add-ons help a lot ...
13:31  gryllida: randomparticle, You'll have to wait a bit... I'm not a developer of the kernel itself, am not familiar with that....
13:32  randomparticle: ok, thanks

13:43  howlymowly: one more question about the addon "speed-dial" :  does that add-on automatically add your mosed-frequently used websites? because for some reason it doesn't do that on my computer..  though the reason for this might be, that i just started using a 100% fresh firefox instalation?
14:09  gryllida: howlymowly, likely
14:09  randomparticle: firefox is apparently using sendto_nocancel
14:09  gryllida: jaunny, what happens when you try?
14:09  randomparticle: is that a private api call?
14:09  randomparticle: it doesn't appear to be documented
14:09 * gryllida really, really, really has no idea how the kernel works
14:40  mdw: gryllida: do you know how I can change the image of a toolbar button from JS?
14:40  mdw: for example, when some event happens in my script, I'de like the toolbar button graphic to change
14:41  gryllida: mdw, .style.backgroundImage="chrome://new/url/here.png"
14:41  mdw: great :-)
14:41  mdw: in my XUL it's called
14:42  gryllida: sometimes it is style.listStyleImage
14:42  gryllida: refer to the css to check how it is defined
14:42  mdw: <toolbarbutton id="smartcharging-toolbar-button"
14:42  mdw: so I suppose the variable I'm accessing is this id
14:43  mdw: gryllida: yes in the CSS it uses listStyleImage
14:43  gryllida: document.getElementById("smartcharging-toolbar-button").style.
14:43  mdw: right :-)
14:43  mdw: neato thanks
14:43 * gryllida mumbles something about ages to debug typos and js lines like this and goes to sleep
14:46  mdw: =]
14:53  mdw: hmmm
14:54  mdw: not a JS expert here
14:54  mdw: but style.listStyleImage = 'something';
14:54  mdw: doesn't parse

15:12  EduardeCalibal: For the 4 beta 7 dev...
15:18  mdw: gryllida: I get [object CSSStyleDeclaration] when getting the toolbar-buttons sytle
15:19  mdw: but trying to set listStyleImage = 'something.png' is no good
15:19  mdw: same with backgroundImage >.<
15:19  mdw: maybe I should use
15:20  mdw: .setProperty('list-style-image') = 'something.png'
15:23  mdw: hmm
15:23  mdw: actually
15:23  mdw: .setProperty('list-style-image', 'something.png', '')
15:31  mdw: ugh
15:31  mdw: even .getPropertyValue() returns a blank string?
15:31  mdw: .... >.<
15:32  mdw: .getPropertyValue('list-style-image')

15:48  eagles0513875: ahh
15:49  eagles0513875: thunderbird channel doesnt seem like its alive or even populated.
15:49  eagles0513875: im running thunderbird on mac osx and i was wondering is there a way to set it to use the address book that comes with mac osx as the default addressbook
15:50  cenar: eagles0513875: You could try #thunderbird on irc.mozilla.org, there would be more population
15:50  eagles0513875: ahh ok
15:50  eagles0513875: strange cuz there is one on here though
15:50  mdw: argh
15:51  mdw: if a toolbar button returns a
15:51  mdw: [object CSSStyleDeclaration]
15:51  mdw: but using setProperty
15:51  mdw: does nothing
15:51  mdw: and getProperty

16:28  j82: I just want to execute some extension javascript when a user navigates to my page; where's a good place to start? (everything I'm seeing for ext development seems to have to do with GUI stuff explicitly)
16:30  mdw: j82: user needs to install extension before it get's executed
16:30  j82: mdw: I think that's pretty clear
16:31  j82: mdw: I'm asking about extension development since #extdev seems to be dead though
16:31  mdw: XUL has MVC, so just do non-gui stuff in the C part ;-)
16:31  j82: k I'll check out MVC, thanks
16:32  mdw: basically all the examples on the docs (having spent all of 2 days doing firefox extensions)
16:32  mdw: the code is seperated into
16:32  mdw: something.xul
16:32  mdw: (the view part)
16:32  j82: ya
16:32  mdw: and something.js
16:32  mdw: the controller part
16:32  j82: k, so I guess some xul is absolutely necessary apparently
16:33  j82: though all I need is to run some js
16:33  Recca: Why does firefox allow sending a crossdomain ajax request, but does not allow viewing the content (by returning empty string)? Would it not be better to simply deny the request in the first place?
16:33  mdw: j82: build the simple hello word app, then just cut out all of the gui stuff
16:34  mdw: you can define an <overlay>
16:34  mdw: load some scripts
16:34  mdw: and listen for the onload action
16:35  mdw: then look at the URI of the browser
16:35  mdw: match it to your site
16:35  mdw: and bingo
16:35  j82: cool thanks

17:39  LinuxPhreak: http://pastebin.com/YFgUr0E6
17:39  bl4ckc0mb: ah I'll look for that, thx sdwilsh. I like it because it doesn't use iframes
17:39  Taint: anyone use firefox portable here?
17:40  sdwilsh: LinuxPhreak: did you go to http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/atlbase.h like it suggestes?
17:41  sdwilsh: oh lovely, that page is missing
17:41  LinuxPhreak: sdwilsh: yes page doesn't exist
17:41  sdwilsh: LinuxPhreak: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/atlbase.h
17:44  sdwilsh: LinuxPhreak: I filed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=613224 about the bad link error; should get fixed soonish hopefully

18:46  hiptobecubic: j82, you mean replace things on the page, for example? yes.
18:47  j82: hiptobecubic: just curoius, what calls do you use to modify stuff; like .innerHTML ?
18:47  j82: .insertAfter or something?
18:47  hiptobecubic: j82, hold on, i put it on github
18:47  hiptobecubic: https://github.com/johntyree/firefox-viewastext/
18:48  hiptobecubic: It's *very* basic. It just makes a new tab, clears out the <body> tag and adds a new <pre> with some text in it.
18:49  j82: but I see you're removing stuff, so you have write access, just not .write() okay cool
