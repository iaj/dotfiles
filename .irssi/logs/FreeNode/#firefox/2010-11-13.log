02:04  Yukinoroh: hello
02:04  Yukinoroh: anyone know how to turn off the slow loading of "href" images?
02:04  Yukinoroh: i.e. go back to the old behaviour, not "overlay"
02:05 @dolske: "overlay"?
02:07  Yukinoroh: yeah, it started recently but I don't think it's the websites that are like that... when I was clicking on the href'ed images, they were loading like a single page, i.e. just the image... but recently the common behaviour is that the page SLOWLY turns to grey (takes 5 seconds) and then the image appears with an X button
02:08  Yukinoroh: and when I close the image with the X button it takes another 5 seconds to be able to navigate through the page again (page goes back to normal color)
02:10  Yukinoroh: it was faster with the "back" button, that is...
02:10  m0ar: Hello
02:11  m0ar: To setup newly opened tabs to always show a certain page instead of that extremely annoying blank, how do I proceed?
02:11  m0ar: Has to be possible in the about:config, right?
02:12  Yukinoroh: dolske: any clues ?
02:14  Turl: m0ar: just looking at the addons site; https://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/addon/777/
02:14  Turl: there are things like https://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/addon/10828/ too
02:15  m0ar: Turl: Adding basic functionality thought addons is not really my style of work, but thanks
02:19  Turl: m0ar: check this out too, https://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/addon/2221/
02:19  Turl: it's an addon, but it does what you need
02:19  Yukinoroh: dolske: nevermind... javascript is the problem
02:20  m0ar: Turl: Yep, I found that earlier. Thanks tho
02:20  Yukinoroh: well... is there a way to disable these &**$&"*($& javascript images effect ?
02:21  Yukinoroh: like plainly load the .jpg files in a new link all the time without disabling javascript completely?

02:28  Yukinoroh: ok... I think that lightbox is the culprit
02:28  Yukinoroh: is there a way to turn only such a script off ? but not the whole javascript ?
02:37  Yukinoroh: is there a way to disable lightbox from the browser? or a plugin for that?
02:39  internetishard: is there a FF dev channel?

03:57  mastertogo: hey, is there a way to turn <blink> and/or <marquee> off in firefox?
04:01  gryllida: 1) http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.blink_allowed
04:03  gryllida: 2) set browser.display.enable_marquee to false to disable <marquee> (iirc it is disabled by default)

12:31  paxed: is it possible to make the error console to show up in a pane or a tab instead of a separate window?
12:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o gavin_]
13:04  gryllida: paxed, yes, try the all-in-one sidebar addon for that
13:06  paxed: gryllida: thanks!
13:07  gryllida: you're welcome.
14:05  anon33_: if i were to download the latest nightly, all i have to do is move it to /usr/lib and create a symbolic link to firefox in /usr/bin - correct?
14:20  gryllida: I just have 2 installations and did not move anything.
14:30  axx_: hi all
14:31  axx_: for a while I've been having nasty Firefox hangs, where after a shortish amount of time FF just hangs, uses about 100% of CPU and never recovers
14:31  axx_: doesn't crash thoughâ€¦
14:31  axx_: (safe-mode doesn't do anything btw)
14:32  axx_: trying to update my add-ons right now, it told me this script was unresponsive, and offer to stop it:  /usr/lib/firefox-3.6.12/modules/CertUtils.jsm:16
14:33  axx_: could this be the thing that has been hanging Firefox on my box?
14:34  axx_: (this is Firefox 3.6.12 on Linux btw, though you can tell from the unresponsive script's location)
14:36  RandomTime: might get a better response on mozilla's own irc (irc://irc.mozilla.org/firefox)
14:36  axx_: Thanks RandomTime, I'll take my question there :)

16:32  sysRPL: hello
16:32  sysRPL: is anyone awake here?
16:35  sysRPL: i was watching an nvidia video about vdpau (video display presentation api for unix like systems) ... in it the nvidia engineer who works on the project describes how it makes all sorts of video rendering through harware and optional compositing and video mixing very powerful on unix like systems
16:38  sysRPL: BUT ... in the features - decoding portion of his speech the engined hilights the following decoding available through vdpau, and those codec (dociding portions) are mpeg-1/2 h.264 avc mpeg part 10, vc-1/wmv3, mpeg4 part 2/DivX
16:38  sysRPL: SO
16:40  sysRPL: if the hardware/linux driver supports decoding h.264 on linux (an other operating systems) ... shouldn't firefox support that feature as well? that is h.264 decoding through the <video> tag?
16:40  sysRPL: url http://nvidia.fullviewmedia.com/gtc2010/0923-a1-2016.html
16:43  anon33_: what's the addon that allows you to install other addons regardless if they're available for your version?
17:13  cdubya: is there an addon that uses searchassist.teoma.com?
17:27  Cobalt: Hello. Why does Firefox 3.6.12 freeze completely when loading pages? Even if I'm loading pages in the background, the page I'm currently on stops responding when it starts loading the other page, and keeps stuttering until the other page's loaded.
