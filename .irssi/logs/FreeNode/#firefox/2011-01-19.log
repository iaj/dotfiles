05:28  hackeron: I've read that websockets will be disabled in firefox4 by default, is this true? :/
05:37  geeknik: Who do I talk to about getting a Firefox 4 Beta Team t-shirt? =) I've been testing Firefox 4 since the beginning, submitted bugs and feedback and I even got a patch built into Firefox 4. Albeit a tiny one. ;) I know I'm not as cool as some people, you know, like giving speeches at FOSDEM, etc, but I wouldn't mind getting one of these awesome shirts. ;)
05:38  geeknik: Unless I'm already on some list. In someone's office. And in that case, I'll shut up and wait patiently. ;)

10:19  solstice: hi. Is there any problem to downgrade from 4-beta to 3.6.13 ?
11:22  tilerendering: heya
11:22  tilerendering: when is official release 4 planned ?
11:56  geeknik: tilerendering: Officially? When it's ready. Unofficially, probably next month unless something big happens to push it back.
11:56  geeknik: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases is a good place to keep an eye on. =)
12:13  tilerendering: thanks !
12:15  geeknik: you're welcome
12:26  geeknik: Not sure what has changed in the last day or three, but with Firefox 4.0b10pre, the Twitter.com is no longer laggy when scrolling around or when typing in the input field. I wanna buy whoever fixed that a beer. ;)
13:00  tilerendering: ;)
14:15  Mikey^: Hey
14:16  Mikey^: Seems like the the cache for firefox 4 has changed, so no one can find a flash file in the cache
14:18 --- boonhead is now known as bh-off
14:20  geeknik: Mikey^: I assume you've checked about:cache? I see quite a few .flv and .swf files in my disk cache.
14:22  geeknik: Be easy to match up the file size and the last fetch date with possible files in the actual cache directory. ;) Or maybe https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cacheviewer/. Could probably be coaxed into working with Firefox 4. ;)
14:22  lapdis: hai2u is thar a channel to discuss chrome? ;_;
14:22  geeknik: lapdis: no idea.
14:23  geeknik: lapdis: try #chrome or #chromium
14:23 * geeknik shrugs.
14:23  Mikey^: geeknik: I did check the last fetch time, but no its full of folders like the itunes library
14:24  Mikey^: and cut into parts
14:24  Mikey^: ofcourse on Linux, its still /tmp that holds it
14:24  Mikey^: :)
14:24  geeknik: Mikey^: And I just checked, CacheViewer does work with Firefox 4.0b10pre. Has a save as option as well so you can save the file to a different location.
14:25  Mikey^: geeknik: nice, I will check that out. Thanks
14:25  geeknik: you're welcome.
14:25  geeknik: I'd install the Addon Compatibility Reporter as well, it can force "incompatible" extensions into working, plus you can report 3.6 extensions that work under 4.0. =)
14:27  Mikey^: Hmm Nice, something back to the community
14:28 * geeknik nods.
14:32  Mikey^: geeknik: the cache viewer is not compatible with Firefox 4 beta 9
14:33  geeknik: Weird. I just used it on Firefox 4.0b10pre.
14:33  geeknik: a nightly alpha build.
14:33  Mikey^: yeah I know
14:33  geeknik: If you're not using something like the Nightly Tester Tools or the Addon Compatibility Reporter to force incompatible extensions to work, it won't.
14:34  Mikey^: I am installing the nightly tester tools
14:34  geeknik: ok.
14:34  Mikey^: lets see if it works
14:48  srikar_: how to store links(bookmarks) of  multiple users at a single place?
