12:10  coredumb: hello
12:11  AkiraYuki: Hi all. I would like maximize the window of firefox in a Debian GNU/Linux system with Xorg (without WM). Can you help me? please
12:12  coredumb: for some time now, i have a problem with firefox - all versions - when i quit it, it doesn't start the next time, just doesn't show anything... The only way to start it, is to start one time in safe mode, quit and then restart normally... Any idea?
12:12  coredumb: i'm on linux though

20:06  qwerty1793: hi, is this a good place to ask about thunderbird? noone appears to be in #thunderbird
20:13  qwerty1793: in thunderbird i'm sending e-mails with 100,000 line txt files attached, as a result whenever i go to look at one of these messages thunderbird spends several minutes opening the attachments and 'appending' their contents to the bottom of the message. can i turn this off?
20:16  Cork[home]: qwerty1793: #thunderbird @ irc.mozilla.org
20:18  qwerty1793: thanks

23:03  sedulous: does anyone have an idea why http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/HWACCEL/ is running rather slow on Radeon GPUs with the fglrx driver? is this fixable somehow? other OpenGL apps run relatively well on the same system
23:07 @kbrosnan: sedulous: check what help > troubleshooting info says about acceleration
23:08 @kbrosnan: AuroraX: uninstall the yahoo toolbar if installed via windows' add remove programs
23:09 @kbrosnan: AuroraX: if that has already been done then check about:config
23:09 @kbrosnan: use the filter to find keyword.url and right click on it to reset
23:23  sedulous: kbrosnan: about:support ends right after the "Graphics" header
23:23  sedulous: (as it does on my nvidia system that delivers 90 FPS in the same test)
