11:43  blip-: hi, anyone succesfully used the Auto-type feature of Keepass with Firefox under Windows ?
11:44  blip-: I'm trying it on gmail and it doesn't do anything

11:53  hudo: sorry, I mean the spell checkers. Where to download ? It seems that I got the german spellchecker installed, but do not know where to find the settings. At the moment I need english spell checking

14:19  akSeya: kbrosnan: I accidently set network.protocol-handler.expose.telnet as string.. now after I reset it, and try to add a boolean one, it is still trated as string
14:19 @kbrosnan: you'll need to right click reset and restart firefox
14:20  akSeya: brb
14:20  Ar-ras: so that i can call this function from my webpage
14:20  Ar-ras: like myCustomAlert("test")
14:21  Ar-ras: in fact
14:22  Ar-ras: i hope to code a plugin which accesses to a local database, and that i can search through this database
14:22  xbskid: Ar-ras: ..Can't you do something like that with HTML5 local storage?
14:22  xbskid: The database bit, at least.
14:26  Ar-ras: is there any wrapper for dom storage?
14:26  xbskid: No idea.
14:27  Ar-ras: btt, i wanted to know if there is any opportunity to achieve this custom database addon
14:29  xbskid: If you can figure out how to interface with a database using JavaScript, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible. I'd just be wondering why run it out of a Firefox addon.
14:30 @kbrosnan: getting the security implications correct would be very difficult
14:33  Ar-ras: hmm, sqlite manager ist complete in js/xul
14:34  Ar-ras: so database access seems to be found out reverseable easy
14:34  Ar-ras: but adding custom javascript function to firefox
14:34  Ar-ras: hmm

15:01  DannyButterman: Hi there
15:03  DannyButterman: my firefox keeps on crashing on some websites (www.boursorama.com, www.viamichelin.com). I had it reinstalled from scratch, installed the latest java and flash plugins, to no avail
15:03  DannyButterman: Can someone help me ?
15:04  DannyButterman: it's a windows XP pro PC btw
15:05  DannyButterman: please ?
15:16  DannyButterman: Am I all alone ? is there a more appropriate channel for my problem ?
15:23  DannyButterman: Well I guess this is an unsolvable issue.
15:30  akSeya: kbrosnan:  it's almost working.. it asked for the program to use for telnet links, the problem is I cannot add parameters to the command.. i need to set "konsole -e telnet %h %p"
15:31  akSeya: i could create a shell script to do that.. but i think there is probably a best way to do so
15:40 @kbrosnan: to me a shell script sounds like your best bet
15:40 @kbrosnan: firefox does not have a way to pass arguments with protocols
15:43  akSeya: kbrosnan: hum.. well.. i created a file firetel with this content: data=${$1//*:\/\//}; konsole -e telnet $data
15:43  akSeya: then put it in /usr/bin and chmod 755 it.. it is working..
15:43  akSeya: kbrosnan: do you think this is the best approach?
15:44 @kbrosnan: yes to me that seems correct
15:44  akSeya: ok then ;)
15:44  akSeya: thanks
15:58  diamonds: the new firefox is nice
15:58  diamonds: doesn't seem as slooow :)
15:59  diamonds: ty developers (if you can hear this over at irc.mozilla)
15:59  burly3: hi people...
16:00  burly3: does anyone know anything about win CE
16:01 @kbrosnan: what about win ce?
16:03  diamonds: lol good luck burly3!
16:15  burly3: is it possible to load flashplayer to it?
16:19 @kbrosnan: i have no idea if adobe has a flash player for windows ce. i would suggest contacting them or searching on the subject
16:26  geeknik: http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer_pocketpc/downloads/player.html
16:26  geeknik: Works for Windows Mobile 5 and Pocket PC 2003 devices. Might work on others WinMo devices.

19:59  yayoj1: you could always google 64 bit firefox for Ubuntu.  But the version pre-installed upon installing Ubuntu is usually the best version to use

21:29  diamonds: am I correct in understanding that firebug script debugger is basically non-functional in 4b rc9 ?
21:30  hider: hey guys, I have a question: Is it possible to make an archive of firefox installing my fav. addons in it? i.e. I want to have my own distribution of firefox with my favorite addons installed in it
21:33 @kbrosnan: diamonds: http://blog.getfirebug.com/2011/01/13/firebug-1-7a8/
21:33 @kbrosnan: hider: byob.mozilla.com or if you want to do it yourself look at the Firefox cck addon
21:33  diamonds: oh 1.7a8
21:34  diamonds: oh you need b10?
21:34  diamonds: darn I have b9 :P
21:34  diamonds: what's the ETA on b10, anyone know?
21:34 @kbrosnan: b10pre as b10 is not out
21:35  diamonds: nightly....
21:35  diamonds: that's going too far out on the limb for me I think
21:36  hider: kbrosnan: I was just looking for a way to copy the xpi file to a directory under the firefox's install directory :)
21:37  diamonds: anyone http://news.softpedia.com/news/Firefox-4-0-Beta-10-Is-Over-90-Blockers-Away-179585.shtml
21:37  diamonds: eh...
21:37  diamonds: I guess i should roll back to 3
21:38 @kbrosnan: beta 10 might not be the last beta
21:38 @kbrosnan: but that article misunderstands the [hardblocker] note
21:39  diamonds: is b10pre any LESS stable than b9?
21:40  diamonds: basically I need firebug and would like to stick with 4b but this is my "production" environment so I'm wary of getting out in front of beta releases
21:40  Hans_Henrik: im having problems with Firefox and <!---->, seems on my page, for unknown reasons, the parser gets it all wrong. (also the highlighters on View Source gets it all wrong), things that should be invisible is not... things that should be visible, is invisible instead etc... any1 know why?  // page: http://cinemastreamz.com/RandomlyQuotess/frawk.html
21:40  hider: kbrosnan: I've looked at byob it's not also supporting adding a custom addon
21:41 @kbrosnan: Hans_Henrik: the -- are what actually indicates a comment
21:43 @kbrosnan: Hans_Henrik: either don't claim to be xhtml or any other html (force the browser into quirks mode) or fix the comment not to have consecutive --
21:46 @kbrosnan: hider: what do you mean by custom addon?
21:47  hider: an non-public xpi file provided, that's I want to create a firefox which has that xpi file preinstalled
21:48 @kbrosnan: the cck then
21:50 @kbrosnan:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck/
21:50  Hans_Henrik: kbrosnan: consecutive -- ?  not sure what/where you mean. the view source color-highligher indicates that the end-of-line is the end of the comment here... <!-- <div id="quotPan"> (EOL)
21:50  Hans_Henrik: doesnt seem right to me...
21:50 @kbrosnan: the line <!-- ------- --> is the problem
21:50  hider: kbrosnan: thanks :)

21:57  hider: how can I start an arbitrary number of firefox instances?
21:58  hider: -no-remote does not work for me
21:58 @kbrosnan: need -P as well
21:59  hider: ah yeah, then it just asks for a profile to select at startup all the time
21:59 @kbrosnan: -P "profile name"
21:59  hider: hmm can I do -P default over and over again?
22:00  woozly: diamonds, thank. but how I can make 'post data' and send it to url? I can't figureout how to do it
22:00 @kbrosnan: each instance needs its own profile
22:00  diamonds: woozly: ... I don't get you, you are starting with NO request?
22:00  hider: I've tested it the answer is no :)
22:00  diamonds: that's not really a firefox thing per se
22:00  diamonds: woozly: write a script to do this.
22:01  diamonds: woozly: are you pen testing or something?
22:01  woozly: diamonds, I need to send POST request to some URL :) I need it for checking work it or not
22:01  diamonds: woozly: ok then write a script using curl and call it from the terminal
22:01  diamonds: ff doesn't really enter into the equation
22:02  diamonds: woozly: or if you really want to see it in FF, put it on your localhost
22:02  diamonds: or run a script in firebug :p
22:02  woozly: diamonds. okay ))
22:02  woozly: thanks
