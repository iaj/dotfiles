07:03  chrislabeard: Hey anyone got a fix for the firefox print bug?
07:05  linuxguy101: chrislabeard: what is the bug?
07:06  chrislabeard: linuxguy101: On this page - http://wgtncty.ideasbynature.com/park-campground
07:06  chrislabeard: linuxguy101: It cuts off after the first park
07:06  chrislabeard: I've tried everything with removing all of the overflow:hiddens and adding overflow:visible but nothings fixin it
07:07  linuxguy101: what cuts off?
07:07  chrislabeard: It doesn't show all of the listings
07:07  chrislabeard: It only shows one after the google map
07:08  chrislabeard: Well actually it cuts out right at the second park
07:08  linuxguy101: chrislabeard: it is the way they coded the page
07:08  linuxguy101: chrislabeard: not a bug
07:08  chrislabeard: Its been reported several times that FF is the only browser that does this. It works in webkit and even IE
07:08  chrislabeard: What is wrong with the code of the site?
07:09  chrislabeard: If it works in all browsers but FF must be something with FF no?
07:10  linuxguy101: chrislabeard: how many comptuers have you tested it on?
07:10  chrislabeard: 3+
07:10  chrislabeard: MAC OS X, Windows 7, Windows xp, Windows Vista
07:11  linuxguy101: well it wont even print on opera
07:11  chrislabeard: Haven't tested opera
07:11  linuxguy101: so i would say it is a html coding
07:11  chrislabeard: lol thats the only one
07:12  chrislabeard: I wonder if I switch the listing to tables that would help
07:13  linuxguy101: chrislabeard: try it..

07:34  pulaski: Hi, I run kubuntu 10.04 with kde 4.5.1. I have the package "Adobe Flash Player plugin installer - 'flashplugin-installer 10.1.02.64ubuntu0.10.04.1 (amd64)'".  How can I run it to get my firefox v 3.6.12 to properly display pages that require flash?
07:51  gryllida: pulaski,
07:51  gryllida: how do they display now?
07:53  pulaski: Hi gryllida, they don't.
07:55  pulaski: gryllida: I'm trying to find out how to run the package "Adobe Flash Player plugin installer  - 'flashplugin-installer 10.1.02.64ubuntu0.10.04.1 (amd64)'" that kpackageKit shows as installed on my machine. Do you know how to do that?
07:57  pulaski: gryllida: If you don't mind, have a look here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1358591&highlight=adobe+flash+install+amd64
08:02  pulaski: gryllida: I was just about to follow those instructions when I remembered an auto update I ok'd not long ago that was an update to the flashplugin-installer. I prefer to change or add software to my box only from the repositories so I went to kpackageKit and looked for "flash". That's when I found the installed flashplugin-installer I'm asking about. Now I want to run it to add flash to firefox but I don't know how.
08:17  pulaski: gryllida: I did a whereis flashplugin-insaller, and found it in /usr/lib64/. I think its a driver, the file in the /usr/lib64/flashplugin-install/ is "libflashplayer.so". The adobe flash plugin test site shows my firefox being without flash and certain websites say I need it. I'd prefer to use that flashplugin-installer I got from the update rather than go through the instructions in the ubuntuforums link above. Do you know how
08:17  pulaski: to use driver I've grabbed from the update?

19:13  pom: kbrosnan: I have not, because I don't want to override if it is already set by the page designer.
19:15  pom: I'm using a dark theme in Fedora and FF adopts my dark input boxes as a default. This is what I want to "reset" to how most pages assume I have my system configured.
