00:58  m0ar: Any decent alternatives to SiteLauncher that works in 4.0b8pre? Or rather than that, any easy fix to make it work?
00:59  angstrom: is there a way to configure firefox using .Xresources?
01:07  auscompgeek: m0ar: What does that do? I'm too lazy to Google.
01:08  m0ar: auscompgeek: ctrl+space get's a speed-dial with sited bound to hotkeys
01:08  m0ar: auscompgeek: so (ctrl+space)+F fires up facebook
01:08  m0ar: Speedy and sleek, love it
01:09  m0ar: I wanna run the lastest firefox version tho, so it sucks that addons aren't working properly
01:09  Zambz: hey guys, has the dissappearing menu bug been fixed in firefox 4 yet?
01:09  Zambz: i'm back on v3 for other reasons but this was the only real bug i noticed in f4b5 and b6
01:10  Zambz: basically after a while, the whole menu bar would dissappear from time to time, it was quite random
01:10  Zambz: and you would be left with this wierd black section above the page and no close buttons or menu buttons up top
01:12  m0ar: Zambz: Easyfix that also makes the firefox UI not suck; Compact Menu 2
01:13  angstrom: or do I have to stick to about:config? (I'd like to change the fonts used)
01:14  m0ar: angstrom: I'm pretty damn sure that you'll have to stick to about:config :(
01:14  angstrom: oh, ok. just wanted to make sure. thanks
01:15  m0ar: angstrom: No problem
01:39 @dolske: Zambz: that sounds like something that was fixed, yes.
