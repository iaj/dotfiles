00:29  test34: Will Firefox ever stop to ask you to confirm a security exceptions? I think this is a scam.. I dont care if the website bought the encryption certificate.. as long as it's encrypted
00:30  test34: do they get a % ?

03:08  allan8904: hey, when i open firefox in terminal i keep recieving these messages Gdk-WARNING **: XID collision, trouble ahead...any ideas how to fix that?
03:25  NightMonkey: Howdy. I'd like to improve Firefox performance on large pages, such as Tor network status pages and the like.
03:25  NightMonkey: Are there any specific tips out there for improving large page performance?
03:30  test34: disable javascript, images and flash?
03:33  NightMonkey: test34: Done the first and last, but not the middle. Page I'm using that exhibits CPU pegging: http://torstatus.all.de/ .
03:33  NightMonkey: test34: I'll try disabling images now.
03:35  NightMonkey: Maybe a little faster, but still a CPU abuser.
03:36  NightMonkey: I guess I'd like to find if there are some configuration options that might be useful to test.
03:39  test34: NightMonkey, wow that is some shitty page
03:40  test34: but it is not slow here.. maybe just 1 sec to load and then is pretty fast
03:41  test34: NightMonkey, It would help if they paginate

03:52  NightMonkey: Maybe it's my Pentium M 1.2 Ghz that's the reason for my grief.
03:52  NightMonkey: test34: The CPU stays pegged while it's arranging the page for about 10 seconds.
03:54  test34: it looks like there is a firefox paginate extension
03:54  test34: and some bookmarklets
03:55  test34: I dont know if it would help you though

03:57  zef88: why isnt the option "log calls to {function_name}" available in my firebug?
04:23 @dolske: NightMonkey: seems ok to me with a Firefox 4 nightly. If you can reproduce with FF4, file a bug.
04:36  NightMonkey: dolske, test34: Thanks.

05:58  Okee: I am wondering if there is a problem with the latest Firefox update?  I am getting an oophs page broken that comes up frequently and indiscriminantly on pages that are good or even when i am not searching for a page, but merely opening up a piece of mail in Yahoo mail.  The latest Firefox doesn't seem to be very stable.
06:00  NightMonkey: Okee: Do you have many add-ons? And does this occour in other browsers or other computers on the same network?
06:05  Okee: Doesn't seem to occur in other browsers or other computers.  Most recently I did add an add-on for Alibaba, that was requested by the website for their chat.  Other than that, the add-ons are stable and haven't been a problem in the past.  Current installed add-ons include Roboform, Colorzilla, Firebug, Firefox Accessibility, Java Console, Java Quick Start, Juicy Studio, No Script, PDFforge
06:05  Okee: toolbar plugin, Search Settings Plugin SVG-edit, Table editor, TestGen4Web, TradeManager, WCAG Contrast Checker, Web Developer, winamp, Wolfram Toolbar, ZoneAlarm Security Engine, ZoneAlrm Toolbar.  One thing that I did notice was that there were three different Java's installed.  I deleted the two oldest and will report back if that made a difference.
06:07  NightMonkey: Okee: Try starting FF without addons and see if you stability improves. You've got a lot of addons installed... :)
06:07  Okee: No problem is still continuing.
06:08  Okee: ok.
06:08  NightMonkey: Okee: You can run FF in "Safe Mode", where all plugins are disabled (but not uninstalled).
06:09  NightMonkey: Okee: Just run "firefox -safe-mode" on your Mac or Linux box, or enter that into the "Run..." dialog on Windows.
06:10  NightMonkey: Okee: Plus, I'd suspect that your more recent addons would be more suspect than the oldest, but try without any first.
06:31  Okee: I am having trouble initiating safe mode.  I followed directions on Mozilla's site, and looked for a file called safemode, but it doesn't appear to be in the Firefox directory.  Is this file invisible?  Maybe my permissions for hidden files needs to be changed.
06:34  Okee: What do you do if there is no Firefox Safemode?  I am running Windows XP, and don't find it.
06:36  Cork: Okee: look in your start menu
06:36  Cork: its not a file
06:37  Cork: its a link to firefox with an attribute -safe-mode
06:39  Okee: Maybe I am blind, but I dont' find this link.  And I definitely don't find it in the Firefox Program directory.  If it is a link in the start menu, it would also be listed in the directory.
06:40  Okee: I tried running it from the command line, but not sure if what I was running is correct. Instructions listed on Mozilla's site only appear to be for Windows 7 http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode?s=safe+mode&as=s#How_to_start_Firefox_in_Safe_Mode
06:40  Okee: Didn't launch from the command line.
06:41  Okee: I am running Win XP, so the command is probably different.
06:41  auscompgeek: There are instructions for all OSes on that page, it merely defaults to your current OS.
06:45  Okee: I don't see the directory for safemode.  I need to take a break.  Back in a few.
06:53  auscompgeek: "directory"?
06:55  Okee: According to instructions found on Mozilla's site, Firefox Safemode is a file in the Firefox Program directory http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode?s=safe+mode&as=s#How_to_start_Firefox_in_Safe_Mode
07:00 @kbrosnan: there should be a shortcut called Mozilla Firefox (safe-mode) in the start menu
07:00 @kbrosnan: in the Mozilla Firefox folder
07:05  Okee: Should be, but there isn't.  There is no directory in the start menu for firefox.
07:05  Okee: And I don't find a safemode file within the Firefox program directory either.
07:06 @kbrosnan: there is no such file in the program directory
07:06  Okee: None that I am able to find.  I did a master search of the directory and also visually inspected it.  Seems strange.
07:06 @kbrosnan: try start > run > "c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe" -safe-mode
07:07 @kbrosnan: not really the only place the shortcut exists is in the start menu
07:09  Okee: It finally came up with the command you suggested.
07:09  Okee: So I am making changes and restarting.
07:12  Okee: Firefox is not crashing, but I am not sure that this did the trick.  I am going to try switch back to regular mode.
07:13  Okee: How do you switch back to regular mode?
07:14  Cork: Okee: you restart firefox
07:16  Okee: I closed Firefox, but the add-ons didn't turn on.
07:33  Okee: Well I ended up starting the add-ons manually.  So far Firefox hasn't crashed.
07:33  Okee: Need sleep, see you all later.
07:47  cryptic: hey, does anyone know what the characters following the / in dictionary files signify?
07:48  Cork: you mean . ?
07:48  Cork: and in what os are you talking about?
07:49  cryptic: en-us has entries like: "offprint/GSDM" "Camille/M" "lucky/RSPT" etc
07:49  cryptic: this is mostly for firefox, windows

07:49  Cork: ah
07:49  Cork: timezone?
07:50  cryptic: EST
07:50  cryptic: UTC-05
07:50  Cork: i meant it might be timezone
07:50  Cork: but donno
07:51  cryptic: i'm not sure if it's timezone related
07:57  auscompgeek: it separates the word from the rule
07:58  cryptic: auscompgeek is there a list of rules?
07:58  auscompgeek: it's hunspell, so sure ;)
07:59  cryptic: I'm trying to organize words based on parts of speech

17:16 @kbrosnan: i've never looked into that feature
17:18  Loneclock: anyone else?

19:54  DarkUranium: hey, my Firefox seems to be finding the 32-bit nspluginwrapper flash library *somewhere*
19:55  DarkUranium: this is 64-bit Linux
19:55  DarkUranium: I want to remove it, but I don't know where to look?
19:56 @kbrosnan: package manager
19:56  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: it's not there
19:56  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: (interestingly, firefox is *not* finding the 64-bit flash player, which IS installed via the package manager)
20:01 @kbrosnan: i am supprised that flash 64 is already in the package manger
20:01 @kbrosnan: are you sure it is not 32 bit
20:01  DarkUranium: says x86_64
20:01  DarkUranium: flash-plugin 10.0.45.2 x86_64
20:02  DarkUranium: and it seems to install stuff int he lib64 folder
20:02  DarkUranium: and it doesn't depend on nspluginwrapper
20:02 @kbrosnan: don't think that is the right version for x64 flash these days
20:03  DarkUranium: well
20:04  DarkUranium: I still need the 32-bit version removed
20:04  DarkUranium: (I'll just use a downloaded one for this)
20:05  DarkUranium: I've just copied in the 64-bit variety
20:05  DarkUranium: detects both now =/
20:07 @kbrosnan: 10.2.161.23 is flash square for 64 bit
20:07  DarkUranium: yeah, I have that one now
20:07  DarkUranium: but I still need to remove the old one from the list!
20:08  DarkUranium: can't find it on the FS =/
20:08  DarkUranium: old one (32-bit) is 9.0 r999
20:08  DarkUranium: new one is 10.2 d161, yes
20:08  DarkUranium: how do I find out in Firefox, where the plugins are being found?
20:12  DarkUranium: found it!
