00:19 @kbrosnan: glen1: check your options/prefs applications tab, set the Web feed to preview in Firefox
00:20  glen1: thanks kbrosnan
00:36  joeytwiddle: ouch my firefox 4.0b won't start any more.  "Couldn't read application.ini" without a newline
00:36  glen1: time to upgrade to IE!
00:37  joeytwiddle: mmm it's 0 length, perhaps i ran out of disk space
00:38  joeytwiddle: i don't think IE really runs on my OS
00:38  glen1: just kidding anyways
00:38  glen1: could u do a reinstall
00:40  joeytwiddle: i have, and she's booted :)
01:19  naquad: is there any way to get some top 10 of most resource consuming tabs?

03:51  auscompgeek: Ah.
03:52  auscompgeek: You can turn on smooth scrolling if you wish, but bare in mind that there is a little bug in smooth scrolling.
03:52  auscompgeek: Tools > Preferences > Advanced > General > Use smooth scrolling
04:05  _LP: Given that firefox allows for creating custom search bookmarks by using %s + keywordsis there a way to create a link on my site, so that the user can simply bookmark the
04:05  _LP: oops - so that the user can simply bookmark the link without having to go back in and edit properties?
04:21  auscompgeek: Hm?

04:24  _LP: That was helpful.
04:24  Olipro: do any of the devs hang out here?

04:25  Olipro: or is mozilla IRC only suitable for the cool people
04:25  _LP: auscompgeek: So I'm looking at the exported bookmarks.html file.. and I see that there's some data - SHORTCUTURL="<keyword>"
04:25  _LP: along with creation date, etc.. all the stuff that can be set by viewing bookmark properties
04:27  _LP: So if I make a keyword based search, by inserting %s into the url, it's all fine and dandy for me, but every user who wants to use the same bookmark needs to go back in to edit the properties, in order to assign a keyword.
04:27  _LP: I'd like to be able to post a link that some user could bookmark, and get the custom title & keyword assignment along with it.

04:37  obiwan_: hi people :D . well is very late i know, i just need to know some things about private browsing. i read that ff won't remember visited pages, etc. but if i close it, will it remember this private session?  thing is , i forgot i was in private mode and started crawling around webs. now i have a pretty big session with twenties of tabs which i don't wanna lose. i could fave all , but then i'd lose the 'previous page' trackings so that would
04:54 @dolske: obiwan_: no, once you close a private browsing session no traces of it will remain locally.
04:56 @dolske: obiwan_: bookmarks persist, though, so probably the best thing to do is "Bookmark All Tabs", quit PB, then load that folder of bookmarks.
05:00  obiwan_: ok then dolske i'll try that one. sad to loose all my visited pages ;S but next time i'll be more careful hehe. see you and thanks =)
