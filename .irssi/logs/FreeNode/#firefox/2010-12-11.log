01:46  _5moufl: hi, do you know how I can move stuff from my status bar to have them in a different order ?
02:12  peepsalot: in many applications, I use ctrl-shift-left/right to select whole words at a time.  I have noticed lately that this is not working for me in textareas and text input fields in firefox 3.6.13 on Ubuntu 10.10.  I'm fairly certain this used to work, but i can't remember exactly
02:14  peepsalot: does ctrl-shift-left/right work for anyone else?

04:15  jort: Hello all - I have an xhtml question, I do not know if it's firefox specific, but I doubt I can get M$ to answer my question, so I'm here.
04:16  jort: I thought that <div /> was valid html - http://validator.w3.org accepts it, but FF doesn't seem to like it. Isn't <div> </div> the same as <div /> ?

06:22  jasonsmr: hello channel. getting one of those infamious XPCOM errors
06:22  jasonsmr: Im currently using SUSE LINUX,
06:22  jasonsmr: and DID some debugging, however I know I could use some help looking for anwsers too
06:24  jasonsmr: I have a finctional self compile that I am using as a tempary solution, however I have not been able to start the systems installed rpm version

06:32 @dolske: what "infamous XPCOM error"?
06:44  jasonsmr: its apparently caused by a mozilla-xulrunner190-32bit-1.9.0.19-0.1.1
06:44  jasonsmr: package and is told to uninstall? I dont see that..
06:45  jasonsmr: its strange that a self compiled package works perfictly well..
06:45  jasonsmr: I know its all internal libarys ,
06:46  jasonsmr: well a reinstall and downgrade to stable worked,,
06:46  jasonsmr: I guess beta and enterprise OS dont mix
06:47  jasonsmr: the XPCOM error is explained in too many places , thatw what I ment, It isnt traced to any one* thing
06:47  jasonsmr: unfortuantly,\
06:48 @dolske: I'm not really sure what you're talking about. sounds like a distro problem.
06:52  linuxguy101: btw, good job on the faster speed on firefox

08:40  bhungy: this list of sites gets cleared when I do tools->clear recent history... and select "site preferences".

10:56  gallina: hi everyone
10:57  gallina: I've got a problem with my Firefox Personas, it seems that only up to 8 personas are kept in the add-on menu. If I install a new one, one of the old ones is kicked out.
10:58  gallina: is this supposed to be this way?
10:58  gallina: Firefox version is 3.6.13 on Ubuntu 10.04
11:02  pinkisntwell: does anyone here use vimperator? do you know why it rings the bell when i press caps lock?

11:29  auscompgeek: in the meantime, Cork: *poke*
11:29  gallina: thank you, auscompgeek :)
11:30  auscompgeek: hm... seems like a new bug
11:31  auscompgeek: though.. does this happen in a new profile or safe mode?
12:05  gallina: auscompgeek, not in safe mode, it's my usual profile
12:10  auscompgeek: gallina: you should test quickly to see if it's an extension causing it
12:10  auscompgeek: if it doesn't work, file a bug at bugzilla.mozilla.org
12:41  gallina: auscompgeek, like, disable all extensions except Personas and then test again?
