00:46  Velmont: Firefox ignores these CSS-stylings (html5):  header h1 { font-size: 40pt; },      and section h1 { font-size: 20pt; }.         Intentional? Any way I can make Firefox respect the html5 section tags?

15:15  hever: Hello. If I benchmark sites with firebug I see there's a lot of blocking. How can I avoid this blocking? I mean it's a client problem isn't it?
15:16  hever: Can I do something at serverside against this?
15:17  Cork[home]: hever: you mean files wait to be loaded?
15:17  hever: yes. in the browser queue.
15:17  Cork[home]: hever: firefox has to limit its access ratio, or the os (windows) will block it
15:17  hever: linux
15:18  Cork[home]: well firefox has the same limit there
15:18  Cork[home]: you can drown a server if you didn't
15:18  Cork[home]: so its sain to have it
15:18  hever: hmm ok there are plugins to higher this limits? Why should firefox have this limits?
15:18  Cork[home]: and no, you can't change it from the server
15:18  hever: I mean it's part of the OS to do this, not ?
15:18  Cork[home]: hever: thing a popular site, with say 500 users a minute
15:19  Cork[home]: its every one of them download every file on the site on the same time, the server would die
15:19  Cork[home]: thats why they throttle
15:19  hever: Ok that means blockig is also if a server can't respond because of to heavy load?
15:19  Cork[home]: many even argue that its to high as it is
15:19  Cork[home]: hever: no
15:20  Cork[home]: its just opens and whait
15:20  Cork[home]: *wait
15:20  hever: aah ok, thats "Wait". And blocking is waiting on the client for a network connection.
15:20  Cork[home]: no
15:20  Cork[home]: it connects and waits for the server to respond
15:20  Cork[home]: it still takes resources from the server
15:21  hever: yes sure but that's "Wait" in Firebugs Net Panel.
15:21  hever: and not "Block"
15:21  Cork[home]: the only thing that doesn't take resources from the server, is when the client waits for other connections to complete beofre it opens a new connection
15:22  hever: and this waiting is blocking...
15:22  Moss: good afternoon, evening, morning, whatever time it is where you are
15:22  Cork[home]: hever: yes cause there already is to many open connections to the server
15:22  Cork[home]: (from the same client)
15:23  hever: Yes, but you can configure this on the server side.
15:23  Cork[home]: the client doen't know, or care how much load there is on the server
15:23  hever: yes
15:23  Cork[home]: hever: you cold only do that if you could push out configurations to the client
15:23  Cork[home]: and you can only do that if you control the computers, like in a company network
15:23  hever: so blocking is a client limit and not a server limit (ok it's perhaps a server limit if the server only allows one or two connections.)
15:24  Cork[home]: hever: if the server only allows one connection, the request fails
15:24  hever: hmm.. ok
15:24  Cork[home]: hever: http doesn't have support for number of connection limits from the server
15:25  ponty: @m0ar: http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.6.10/source/
15:25  Cork[home]: so its all in the clinet
15:25  hever: So why is firefox limiting this itself?
15:25  hever: Why it's not just part of the OS ?
15:25  Cork[home]: pompy: he already left
15:25  Cork[home]: *ponty
15:25  Cork[home]: hever: cause the os doesn'
15:25  Cork[home]: *doesn't always have that deep control
15:26  hever: The OS allows as much as connections as it could and firefox limits itself ?
15:26  Cork[home]: hever: as its not "number of connections from the program" its number of connections for that specifical site
15:26  Cork[home]: hever: its a difference in what it limits
15:26  hever: sure
15:27  hever: ok but why does firefox do this?
15:27  Cork[home]: hever: the os limits the number of half open connection from the computer
15:27  hever: ok
15:27  Moss: is this about the recent issues with the nightly and max connections?
15:27  Cork[home]: not number of open connections to a website
15:28  hever: but the blocking occours because a firefox limit is reached or perhaps an limit reported by the OS.
15:28  Cork[home]: hever: the blocking happens cause the clinet only opens x number of connections to the same site
15:28  Cork[home]: so to not ddos the sites when alot of user visit the same site
15:28  hever: yes, that's the "limit" I meant
15:28  Cork[home]: *not to
15:28  Cork[home]: yes
15:29  Cork[home]: its done by firefox, and most other browser actually
15:29  hever: ok ok, but why? Firefox does this to not (d)DOS the server? That's polite but I think firefox should be more egoistic....
15:30  Cork[home]: hever: so servers crashing and showing white pages is better?
15:30  hever: And display the site as fast as possible with as much parralell connections as possible...
15:30  hever: This is up to server infrastructure !
15:30  Cork[home]: hever: the load on the server would be freeking
15:30  hever: you think so ?
15:31  Cork[home]: you would have to have san
15:31  Cork[home]: san's to be able to spread the load
15:31  Cork[home]: cause one server wouldn't be able to cope
15:31  Cork[home]: for the big sits
15:32  hever: yes sure I know the server side achritectures.... but whatever this is something on the server side.
15:32  Cork[home]: and as it would only be speeding up the site just a little, it would highten the cost for the server ALOT
15:32  Moss: Cork[home]: the problem I currently have seems to be firefox having issues with a lot of connections to different servers and not to an individual one.
15:32  Cork[home]: it would make the request slower, cause it would be way more paralell downloads
15:32  hever: and the client should not care. The client should try to show the site as fast as possible and the server must be able to handle those requests!
15:32  Cork[home]: and would be an overall loss
15:33  Cork[home]: Moss: what os?
15:33  Moss: win7 64
15:33  Cork[home]: hever: what your asking for would more or less kill the web
15:33  hever: Cork[home], thats a really good point! You need a good algorithm on the client side!
15:33  Cork[home]: Moss: windows only allow 2-3 connections to open at the same time
15:33  Cork[home]: Moss: so its a limit from your os
15:34  hever: Ok it's part of the HTTP spec as an recommendation.
15:34  Cork[home]: hever: you can't have algoritms for this, as you don't have any information to calculate on
15:34  Moss: hrm, win7 never had the half open connections issue...
15:34  Cork[home]: you have i have x files to download from y site
15:34  Moss: and the funny thing is: ff 3.6.11 has no problem with the same settings that stall the nightly :/
15:35  Cork[home]: Moss: i haven't seen any problem but i run on a patched winxp and linux
15:36  hever: Thank you Cork[home] you really helped me and get me a bit more into the client site. I'm reall thankful for this and I understand more!
15:36  hever: Cork[home], but at least there are some plugins to tune those settings...
15:36  Cork[home]: hever: ya, but as i said, untill there is a way for the server to tell the client about its load, there is no way to make anything more intelegent then limit the number of concurent connections
15:37  Cork[home]: hever: there is some about:config hacks, but they are STRONGLY discurraged!
15:38  Cork[home]: as most of the time they only give more loads on the servers, without giving more speed to the client
15:38  hever: Cork[home], I still think it's up to the server to server "any" load (belongs to the kind of site). But I see the problem that downloading all at the same time could slow up the process of downloading a website. But at least the client could know it's own connection and "rate" an simple algorithm on this and open more conns on faster lines.
15:39  Cork[home]: hever: the only "choice" the server has, is to cope, or break
15:40  Cork[home]: it can't say you my only use this or that many connections
15:40  Cork[home]: they really have no control
15:41  Cork[home]: and browsers should keep sain settings that give good speed, and doesn't overload the servers "just cause it might make it faster"
15:41  hever: yes but the server could handle an really big amount of connections "unlimited". And it should be up to the client how much he can do with it's line.
15:41  Cork[home]: hever: do you have any idea what that cost?
15:41  Cork[home]: those server is hugly expensive
15:41  Cork[home]: and i mean extremly expensive
15:42  hever: Well that depends on the kind of server, the usage and the number of clients and really occouring concurrent users.
15:42  hever: concurrent requests
15:42  Moss: most big sites have several servers and load balancing
15:42  hever: sure
15:42  hever: and that's what they should do.
15:43  Cork[home]: a normal server at can handle normal the load from today, can handle around 500-1000 concurent users and it costs around 10-100 eur a year
15:43  hever: And a client should not care about the server load. It should just put as much as possible through the "last 10 meters" to the client.
15:43  Cork[home]: if you would need to be able to handle request for all files at once
15:43  Cork[home]: that same sever would handle 10-20 users
15:44  Cork[home]: and you would have to grab a server san for around 1000-100000 eur a eur a year
15:44  Cork[home]: just cause some users might save a few msecs...
15:44  Cork[home]: thats just stupid
15:44  Moss: hever: umm, no. hell no.
15:45  Cork[home]: hever: the net works only cause clients stays sain, if they don't things break fast
15:45  hever: sry. I'm away for a hour or so.
15:45  Cork[home]: and its really hard to cope with many concurent connections
15:46  hever: thanks for your opinion. I'll dig a bit in my books "The Tanenbaum" and think about it ;)
15:46  Cork[home]: (cause http has quite a big overhead)
15:46  hever: I'll really rethink it, thanks
15:47  Moss: that's what you get for using a stateful protocol ;)
15:47  Cork[home]: Moss: http isn't statefull
15:48  Moss: it isn't? probably had the wrong definition in mind then
15:58  JodaZ: hmm, how do i get debugging symbols for firefox ? so i can like see function names in ollydbg ?
16:01  JodaZ: Cork[home], yeah, just keep telling yourself that and continue making pages in java or ruby
16:02  Cork[home]: JodaZ: the server might be startefull, but the PROTOCOL isn't
16:02  Cork[home]: state full is a sessioncookie
16:03  Cork[home]: its to work around the fact that the protocol has noway to keep state
16:03  JodaZ: so ?
16:03  Cork[home]: http isn't statefull
16:03  Cork[home]: never has been and never will be
16:04  Cork[home]: servers and/or clients can be statefull, but not mix those togeater
16:04  Cork[home]: *'do not
16:05  JodaZ: cookies are a part of http, they make it statefull, but thats besides the point, i was refering to your earlyer "oh noes performance" point
16:47  semperos: I know about Firebug, but looking for an addon with the following functionality (or similar)
16:47  semperos: activate plugin, user clicks on an element on the page, it popups up a dialog showing its containing HTML element and all attributes
16:51  semperos: anybody else seeing developer.mozilla.org down?

17:38  JodaZ: have there been any recent changes to the javascript garbage collection in or leading to 3.6.11 ? it has crashed on me a few times and i got arround to investigating a crash and it seems to have originated from somewhere in the garbage collector
17:50  Arsanerit: When I use firefox to connect from home to www.alsa.es, I get "The server at www.alsa.es is taking too long to respond.". When I connect from anywhere else, it's fine. My conclusion was a routing problem. But when I connect with Konqueror, it's also fine! How can it be that Firefox@home times out connecting to www.alsa.es, whereas Konqueror@home and Firefox@elsewhere can connect without problems?
17:51  Arsanerit: Never mind, I mis-diagnosed the issue.
17:51  Arsanerit: The aforementioned information is incorrect.
17:54  Arsanerit: I'm sorry for wasting your time.
