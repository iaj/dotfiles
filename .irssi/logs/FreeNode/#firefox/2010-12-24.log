08:14  WAT: is there a channel for firefox 4 beta support or can I ask questions here?
08:15 @Peng: You could ask questions here, but you'd likely be better off on irc.mozilla.org.
08:15  WAT: ty
08:18  WAT: does anybody know any good video / audio conversion channels on freenode?
08:26  rryouumaa: Peng: which channel?
08:27 @Peng: rryouumaa: For what? Firefox 4? I'd try #firefox. I do not know if there is a more specific channel.

09:18  _6502_: Hello everyone. I'm using Ubuntu and firefox 3.6.13. While playing with javascript I found accidentally that with some canvas related code I can take down the whole X system... should I invest the time to isolate a minimal example ?
09:21 @Peng: Ideally.
09:21 @Peng: Someone may have already filed the bug, of course.
09:22 @Peng: Of course, filing a bug with complicated-but-possible steps to reproduce is better than not filing a bug at all.
09:23  _6502_: ok i will try
09:23  _6502_: i'm a bit scared because for every experiment i need to reboot (i cannot even kill x)
09:23 @Peng: VMs would be good for this.
09:24  _6502_: hmmm.... makes sense, i'll do that instead
09:24  _6502_: however is firefox using hw acceleration for canvas (looking at performance i'd say not, but i can't tell for sure)
09:24  _6502_: ?
09:25 @Peng: Dunno, sorry.
09:36  _6502_: good... mozilla bugtracker is down
09:37 @Peng: I'm having no issues.
09:38  _6502_: when i try a search for "firefox canvas hang" it tells me that service is unavailable
09:39  _6502_: doh
09:39  _6502_: i was searching all products... my fault
09:39  _6502_: restricting to firefox works
09:40 @Peng: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=canvas+hang works for me.
09:40 @Peng: (And does have a couple good results, though they may not be the same bug as you found, of course.)
09:52  _6502_: looks like the same bug as 601712 (i've the same error message in Xorg.0.log.old
09:55 @Peng: _6502_: That bug says it's a fairly generic error message. Plus, does it involve <canvas>?
09:56  _6502_: i'm looking at the site cited but i don't understand what are the steps to reproduce
09:57  _6502_: anyway once the VM with ubuntu complete the installation i'll try to get a minimal javascriot showing the problem
09:57  _6502_: script
09:59 @Peng: The steps to reproduce for that bug seem to be "go to that website, click on a certain link, wash, rinse, repeat until Firefox explodes"
10:01  _6502_: i think i can make it happen with just a few lines of javascript (create a canvas, create another one, set up a deadly matrix transform and then draw one on the other)
10:02  _6502_: in my script i'm using drawImage with an hand-computed matrix to do texture mapping, works find in chrome but in firefox you get sometimes a very slow response and missing triangles and with some specific numbers a complete X hang (i had to connect to my pc via ssh to be able to reboot it)
10:03  _6502_: works find = works fine
10:06 @Peng: You should be able to reboot it with Magic SysRq too.
10:07  _6502_: nothing on the keyboard worked
10:07  _6502_: note that it even stops for a few seconds the mouse cursor
10:07  _6502_: after that you can move the cursor but nothing happens
10:08  _6502_: even connecting via ssh was quite slow, but worked. I killed everything i could but the only way out i found was "reboot"
10:45  wucan: I'm in builting thunderbird in comm-center, but I had now dirty the src dir, so how to clear it?
10:48  wucan: "make -f client.mk clearsrcdir" show build/auoconf/clean-config.sh not found, where is it?
10:51  wucan: Or are hg had a cmd to clean all untracked files,  for I to clean src dir?

14:37  xelister: hello community :)
14:37  xelister: Is firefox development incopetent and stagnated?
14:37  xelister: for over 2 years there is a bug that mouse cursor does not show bussy when over loading page
14:38  xelister: 2 years and still it is there
14:38 @kbrosnan: i believe that is intentional. makes the browser 'feel' and less responsive slower
14:40  xelister: kbrosnan: bug report doesnt mention that, also, it totally sucks
14:40  xelister: I dont know comfortably if page is yet loaded or loading still
14:41 @kbrosnan: commnet 0 says that
14:41  xelister: which url of bug report
14:41  xelister: if yes, then there should be option to disale this idiotic UI idea
14:41 @kbrosnan: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482985
14:41  xelister: and restore sane behaviour
14:43  xelister: is this Mac OS X idea?
14:43  xelister: s/incopetent/faggotized by mac os x ideas
14:43  xelister: please dont shove mac os x 'better' HUI ideas on users thatn want normal standards
14:50  xelister: so, is it because firefox fails to implement this, or because it is decided to follow mac's UI ?
14:50  xelister: if the former, then, make it exactly the same as tab icon?
