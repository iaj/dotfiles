05:18  Talon_: has anybody else noticed firefox seems to be forwarding you to more bogus sites than not? I run linux, and firefox is usually my default browser of choice, but I've been using chrome more often now since it seems to avoid forwards. I'll be on facebook, or even weather.com and somehow get forwarded to scanner.virusmustdie.info thats totally fake and looks like windows scanning for viruses and
05:18  Talon_: opens a download for some .exe
05:19  Talon_: I dunno if it has anything to do with my addons, but I only use three, html validator, adblock plus, and firebug.
05:22  Talon_: I found the full forward: http://scanner.virusmustdie.info/scan.php?campaign=mmb_233871021&landid=4 but beware, it is bogus and prolly infectious if you download that exe it trys to send you

13:10  marcel01: M_o_C: No, it doesnt switch afaik
13:12  marcel01: and it isnt always possible either.
13:15  M_o_C: Ok, thanks.
13:15  marcel01: np
13:15  M_o_C: And it seems like you're right because the download didn't suddenly get stuck^^
13:16  marcel01: lol ok
13:17  marcel01: if it carried the download over to the proxy, it would have had to pause it and continue on the proxy connection

16:25  synapt: Curious question, what exactly does Firefox on Windows (XP to be specific) use the same exact as IE in lines of stylesheets?
16:26  synapt: I got a system with this extremely akward 'bug', where IE and Firefox are not rendering stylesheets at all, according to Firebug, Firefox is 'processing' the stylesheet, fetching images/etc from it, but it won't render it in the browser, leaving nothing but the general HTML layout.  IE does the exact same, Opera however works fine.  Anyone come across something like this before?
16:26  synapt: (This is all sites by the way)

17:48  stercor: There was an add-on to mozilla that allowed Java and/or Javascript programming and debugging.  Does anyone know what its name is, or whether it's built into Firefox?
17:48  stercor: I'm using Minefield.
17:49 @kbrosnan: not java. javascript would be firebug or venkman
17:49  synapt: stercor: Firebug is most likely what you want
17:49  synapt: WebDeveloper toolbar has some as well I think, but it's more limited compared to what Firebug will give you
17:50  stercor: That sounds right.  I didn't believe it to do Java; just thought I'd throw it out.
17:56  gaberlunzie: hi, i'm using ubuntu 10.10 64-bit and when i launch firefox, in addition to the usual 'firefox-bin' process there's a another (new?), 'firefox' ... how come there're now 2 processes?
17:58  gaberlunzie: is this forum or ubuntu better for asking that question?
18:11  stercor: How can I run Firefox along side of Minefield?
18:12  stercor: Separate icons, separate programs type of deal.
18:13  stercor: When I bring up Firefox I get Minefield, even when starting from the Firefox install directory (separate from Minefield).
18:14  stercor: Firebug won't install in Minefield.  Therefore I got Firefox.

18:17  geeknik: yw
18:24  stercor: geeknik: perfect, so far... :-)
18:29  stercor: Where in the profile does it tell where to find the firefox program?
18:31  stercor: Or, rather, how can I specify the program to launch?
19:05  stercor: I can use Minefield for fun and Google Chrome for work...
19:06  stercor: That is, unless there's another (simple) solution.
19:06 @kbrosnan: what are you asking?
19:23 --- seejay` is now known as seejay
19:25  stercor: kbrosnan: if there's a way to run firefox and minefield along side each other, each with its own address space.
19:26 @kbrosnan: stercor: firefox -P -no-remote for the second instance
19:27  stercor: thanks!  I'll try it right now.
19:30  stercor: It worked!
19:30  stercor: kbrosnan: What do the parameters mean? -P -no-remote?
19:32  Terabyte: hey, i have a webservice running locally on my computer, is firefox capable of sending http get/post requests to webservices on a pc? (is there a handy plugin?)
19:32  Terabyte: say a plugin with a window where i can put a payload, tell it the address, and send the request?

19:39 @kbrosnan: er fine
19:39 @kbrosnan: if it is just a html file accessed over file:/// then i don't think posts or gets are done
19:46  Terabyte: so if i just type http://localhost/7509/customer/1/ that is a get?

22:06  Djpenguin: Are there any add-ons that you know of that can restore a window with all its tabs included? What I'd like to do is have certain windows that say have a list of different forums on tabs individually, and then I click through and click on this window (perhaps from the add-on menu) and it opens the window and all of the tabs. It's not a window that I want to have open all the time and there are too many tabs to open through just bookmar
22:06  Djpenguin: there a way I can do this?

22:09  rjohnson19: Djpenguin: ctrl+shift+N or history - recently closed windows doesn't do what you want?
22:09  Djpenguin: Not well enough, no
22:10  Djpenguin: xangua: this can restore windows full? it looks like something similar to just bookmarks
22:11  mavhc: you want a session saver that works per window?
22:13  Djpenguin: yep
22:16  Djpenguin: is there such a thing?
