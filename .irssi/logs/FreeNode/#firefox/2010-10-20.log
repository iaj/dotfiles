02:23  bimbo: hello, if I've got a javascript xpcom component (initialized by placing it under components/ dir), is it possible to modify its properties by issuing calls to it from say, a xul overlay?

05:09  rryouumaa: i found a new bug
05:09  rryouumaa: or at least it seems new...
05:10  rryouumaa: when i click on a link, the back button remains greyed out so i can't go back
05:10  rryouumaa: so to go back, i have to manually enter the url :(
05:11  rryouumaa: anybody know which extensions might trigger this?  i run tmp, copy all urls, bartab, abp, noscript
05:25  joeyjones: any idea why firefox would repeatedly make me confirm a security exception for a self-signed ssl cert?
05:26  rryouumaa: joeyjones: that happened to me too.  no idea.
05:26  rryouumaa: our love 4 boobies came and went
05:26  rryouumaa: short-lived fetish i guess
05:27  rryouumaa: (or spammer?)
05:32  joeyjones: rryouumaa: lol
05:32  joeyjones: it's for one particular site, and it's so dman annoying~

14:09  Unode|Work: Is there any way to have javascript return valid HTML for img and other self closing tags?
14:09  Unode|Work: seems like every time I use innerHTML the tag ends with > instead of />
14:10  Unode|Work: even though the original document uses <img ...></img> or <img ... />
14:11  Unode|Work: or at the very least, return 'unmodified' source code
14:22  kamathln: unknown tabs and groups gatecrashing at the tabcandy party
14:29  anon33_: I really don't like Panorama and wish there was an option to turn it off completely
14:32  kamathln: anon33_: I like Panaroma.. but I prefer treestyletabs
14:32  kamathln: Panaroma has its own taste and tangent of possible future features
14:33  kamathln: and it fits well into the next generation of UI which are activity centric
14:34  kamathln: I am just cribbing about some of the bugs in the current source.. which I bet the great coder soceity of Mozilla will enjoy crunching like Timon and Pumba
14:50  kamathln: anon33_: you still around?
14:50  kamathln: anon33_: how often do you upgrade your firefox ?
14:50  anon33_: Yeah - I'm using the nightly from the 19th
14:51  kamathln: oh ok
14:52  anon33_: kamathln: It just weirded out (I know, I know - I'm using the nightlies) with app tabs and was really frustrating to try and reorganize everything
14:52  anon33_: It's a feature I don't use, that's why I wish it had an option
14:53  kamathln: anon33_: you can just .. not use it
14:53  kamathln: :D
14:53  anon33_: I'd like to :-O
14:53  kamathln: its a feature that runs only if you activate
14:53  kamathln: just pretend it isnt there
14:53  kamathln: ;)

21:30  paxcoder: does anyone know why svg isn't supported by FF's img tag? It is in Chromium and Epiphany.
21:30 @kbrosnan: will be in Firefox 4
21:31  paxcoder: well that's too friggin late.
21:31  paxcoder: i asked why. i don't get it.
21:31 @kbrosnan: coder time is a scarce resource
21:32  paxcoder: they get paid, and the help of the community, and they still can't just support svg? it's not like it's a proprietary format. it's XML, and there are libs. heck, they even render it, just not in img.
21:33  paxcoder: this was a big FF let down for me, i must admit.
21:33  paxcoder: i bet even new IE (as in released version) supports it.
21:34 @kbrosnan: does not
21:34 @kbrosnan: ie can't handle svg
21:37  paxcoder: still, FF isn't IE. The new HTML std supports inline SVG, we don't even have img. I'm sorry I'm whining but this is ridiculous.
21:38  codin: my FF instance just blocked, will I be able to restore the opened tabs if I kill the process now ?
21:38 @kbrosnan: tabs should be restored when you restart
21:38 @kbrosnan: at worst you will get the session restore tab to allow you what tabs to restore
21:39  codin: if I kill the process, I will not have an option to say "save opened tabs & exit" ...
21:39 @kbrosnan: they are saved every few seconds
21:40  sponzor: hi. is there way to install firefox to a true crypt partition? that i will have 2 firefoxs... one in program files and one "safe at true crypt partition"
21:40  codin: uhhh ... the stack trace shows 74 frames, and most of them are in xulrunner
21:41  paxcoder: Windows stores your stuff to Local Data. I'm not sure if FF uses this default place, but if it does, having the binary encrypted is useless.
21:42  codin: kbrosnan, where does FF store the addresses in the opened tabs ? is there an .sqlite db for it ?
21:42 @kbrosnan: sessionstore.js and .nak
21:42 @kbrosnan: .bak
21:42  codin: this think is huge ...

21:49  paxcoder: it felt the craving for endless loop. but you'd have to prove it's FF that did that not NS.
21:50  paxcoder: actually, it's probably the XULrunner thingy
21:50  codin: paxcoder, so if I can reproduce it by disabling NS would that be a proof ?
21:51 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 93 seconds
21:51  paxcoder: by removing it, yes.
21:51  codin: remove or disable ?
21:51  paxcoder: remove, to be on the safe side.
21:51 @kbrosnan: disable does the same
21:51  paxcoder: there are debug options, you know.
21:51 @kbrosnan: the extension code is not run if it is disabled
21:52  paxcoder: you could file a bug.
21:52  paxcoder: kbrosnan, my bad.
21:52  codin: disabling it does the trick, the website loads properly ...
21:53  codin: so it is NS fault ?
21:53 @kbrosnan: if the issue is present with the extension only then yeah
21:54  paxcoder: kbrosnan, shouldn't xulrunner handle misbehaving addons?
21:54  codin: if I enable the extension, the content of the page does not load, but only a link is rendered
21:55  sponzor: ok i will try whit that. tnx
21:55  codin: if I try to temporarily enable the domain, then it becomes unresponsive
21:58 @kbrosnan: extensions are very powerful, there is no way for xulrunner to test for program completness. there is a project for firefox 4 that creates a more controled api called jetpack
22:00  zen[trash]: hi, when I click TAB + T firefox opens a new tab as a blank page.. -how to set this up so it opens google?
22:01  xangua: new tab home addon, or sometjing like that is called
22:02  zen[trash]: sry when I click Ctrl + T of course
22:02  zen[trash]: will this be a part of the next version firefox?

22:21  zen[trash]: was this opetion removed from firefox to make it lighter, so it can compete with chronomium? that's like nike selling shoes without laces, to make them extra light
22:23  elb0w: I have ubuntu 10.10 and I dont even use firefox
22:23  elb0w: let alone install addons
22:23  elb0w: I just opened it first time and it was there
22:24  zen[trash]: elb0w, you have a win and it opens new tab in google or blanc?
22:24  elb0w: oh
22:25  elb0w: blank
22:25  zen[trash]: elb0w, you have a window open and click Ctrl + T and it opens new tab in google or blanc?
22:25  zen[trash]: ok
22:25  elb0w: You are talking about the home page showing up?
22:25  zen[trash]: yes
22:25  zen[trash]: addon "new tab homepage" fixes it
