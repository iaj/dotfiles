13:09  ggonzalez: hi
13:09  ggonzalez: I am learning to write extension for firefox, I am just writing a basic one.
13:10  ggonzalez: I have written the whole basic files, but I get "extension couldn't be installed because it is not compatible with 3.6.12"
13:10  ggonzalez: I have maxVersion set to 3.6.*
13:10  ggonzalez: even changing it to 3.6.12 doesn't make anything
13:12  ggonzalez: any idea?

23:14  Mehhh: hi
23:16  Mehhh: is there an extension that will make Google not stupid anymore? It seems like every link is now www.google.com/bla/url=http://www.siteiwanttogoto.com/page.html   . I get that they want to protect me, but I don't need it. Is there an extension that replaces those URLs with direct URLs to the sites? Idealy, also make it so that if I click a Google Images link, I go to the full-screen image, instead of a google preview.
23:16  Mehhh: like it used to be
23:41  Mehhh: back
23:45  Mehhh: any tips on fixing Google during my absence?
23:49  Unit193: Nope :( userscripts.org
23:53  Mehhh: Unit193: thanks. found one for images, but not for normal search. I guess it doesn't bother anyone else?
23:53  Mehhh: I always forget about Greasemonkey
23:54  Teratogen: lara?
23:58  Mehhh: Unit193: and someone in #windows recommended the OptimizeGoogle extension, which fixes Web Search. between that and the greasemonkey Googe Image script, I'm set :P
