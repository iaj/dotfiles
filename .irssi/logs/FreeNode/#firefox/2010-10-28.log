01:10  macmartine: When I close Firebug, some javascript doesn't run properly, but when it's open it works fine. Very strange. One example is  at http://namedrawer.heroku.com/ -- when you click the tabs at top, the active one should have a white background. this doesn't happen when i have firebug closed. any ideas?

04:44  nightwalk: I'm curious. Did something change in 3.6.7+ as far as firefox' memory management is concerned? I'm seeing about *half* the memory usage I typically saw in < 3.6.8
05:00  l34k: hello i have a quick configuration option question: I'm on a mac so whenever I push cmd+q it quits.  Now, I accidentally turned off the 'warn me before you do this' option. How may i reenable that option?
05:01  l34k: i guess no one's on :<
05:04  l34k: misclick
05:05  nightwalk: l34k: Did you look for any obvious settings in about:config?
05:10  l34k: i did
05:10  l34k: like
05:10  l34k: warnOnQuit
05:11  l34k: i turned it on
05:11  nightwalk: It didn't work?
05:11  l34k: its set to true
05:11  l34k: ya
05:12  l34k: browser.warnOnQuit true
05:12  nightwalk: yes, as in 'yes it did'?
05:12  l34k: yes as in it didn't work
05:13  nightwalk: did you restart the browser before checking to see if it worked?
05:14  l34k: yes i did
05:15  nightwalk: How about browser.tabs.warnOnClose? Is it set to true as well?
05:16  l34k: hmm
05:16  l34k: let me check
05:19  l34k: nightwalk ya it's set to true
05:22  nightwalk: Hmm....I'm coming up blank now
05:22  l34k: :<
05:22  l34k: ah well, thanks anyway
05:22  nightwalk: might have to wait a few hours until someone else comes back
05:24  l34k: sure thing

11:08  wuffi600: where can i find a calendar addon for thunderbird 2.0.x?
11:10  auscompgeek: wuffi600: Lightning.
11:11  Fire-_-Fly: is there a different channel for xul developers?
11:13  Cork: #extdev @ irc.mozilla.org
11:13  Cork: or if you want xul in general #xul @ irc.mozilla.org
11:14  Fire-_-Fly: I'm actually looking for extension devlopers
11:14  Fire-_-Fly: thanks
11:16  auscompgeek: Cork: hm... I think we need some sort of Google bot in here.
11:16 * auscompgeek volunteers to be one
11:16  wuffi600: auscompgeek: sure, but it's hard to find. i took me half an hour to find the 0.9 version of lightning for download
11:16  auscompgeek: wuffi600: I see.
11:16  Cork: auscompgeek: firebot would be nice :D
11:16  auscompgeek: wuffi600: Note that they have a channel at irc://moznet/calendar .
11:16  auscompgeek: Cork: very :>
11:17  auscompgeek: Cork: solution, a janus bot! :P
11:19  wuffi600: auscompgeek: thanx for your hint.
11:19  auscompgeek: wuffi600: sure.

22:39  norbert_: hi, I downloaded 4.0b6 under Linux to try WebGL, but everywhere the pages tell me the browser doesn't support it
22:39  norbert_: do I have to flip a switch somewhere? :)
22:40 @kbrosnan: yes
22:40 @kbrosnan: about:config filter on webgl
22:40 @kbrosnan: there is a pref webgl enabled for all sites, needs to be true
22:42  norbert_: thanks; still doesn't work though... http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/field/field.html
22:44  norbert_: this doesn't work either https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/demos/google/san-angeles/index.html
22:44  norbert_: I don't have to save what I change at about:config, do I?
22:45 @kbrosnan: might require a restart, i can't recall if it is a restartless pref
22:46 @kbrosnan: no
22:47  aaaaa0: amazon.com gives me an "XML Parsing Error" on certain pages. is there any way to disable this and still view the page?
22:48  norbert_: maybe 4.0b6 doesn't support WebGL
22:49  aaaaa0: I'm using 3.6.11
22:51  norbert_: oh, the console shows messages... "WebGL: Can't get a usable OpenGL context"
22:52  norbert_: I'm going to try the latest trunk; firefox-4.0b8pre.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2
22:53 @kbrosnan: norbert_: the big stumbling block in linux is graphics drivers
22:53 @kbrosnan: if you are not using binary drivers from ati or nvidia it probably won't work
22:54  norbert_: myeah
22:55  norbert_: anyways, thanks for thinking along; have to go
