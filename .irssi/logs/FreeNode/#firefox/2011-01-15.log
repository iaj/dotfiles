00:23  TigerRage: i haven't found a solution yet
00:23  TigerRage: lol
00:23 @Peng: Tried irc.mozilla.org?
00:23 @Peng: What did you think of ScrapBook?
00:29  sbpaul: how do i make it so <a href="blah" target="_blank"> opens in a new tab?
00:33  Unirgy: hi, just downloaded 4.0b9 but cleartype antialiasing is still not available - is it planned for 4 stable?
00:42 @kbrosnan: sbpaul: if you mean as a web developer you can't
00:43  sbpaul: no as a user
00:44 @kbrosnan: it should open in a tab unless the site is hiding part of the interface or set a specific size for the window
00:45 @kbrosnan: if you want such things in a tab anyways look into an extension that modifies tab behavior such as tab mix plus
00:46  _ajax_: Has anybody ever used javascript to scrape a webpage in developing an add-on?
00:47  _ajax_: I have looked into a bunch of tools but those aren't available in javascript.
02:13  TigerRage: yeah, i was interested in spiderzilla--but it doesn't work with 3.6.13
02:13  TigerRage: scrapbook looks promising, thanks
02:16  TigerRage: the problem with scrabook is that is captures a single webpage
02:17  TigerRage: i'm looking for something that can capture all links, pages, images associated with a URL/subdomain
02:19  geeknik: just use http://www.httrack.com/. spiderzilla was the front end for that program anyways. =)

02:33  slavka`: hey guys... was just wondering if theres a plugin for firefox that allows a log of every function call executed during a pageload... kind of like a trace?
03:52  icwiener: Hi, is the key  browser.tabs.tabMinWidth  no longer supported in Fx 4?
03:52  icwiener: It is not applied here in b8.
03:55  on3pk: Hey guys.  In b9, whenever I open a new tab, it gets assigned to a new tab group.  Is this supposed to happen?
03:56  on3pk: because I'm not going to lie, I sort of wish it didn't...
04:25  on3pk: Hmm
04:25  on3pk: Issue seems to be resolved with a restart.

04:55  on3pk: heftig: thanks.  Curious, what is

08:30  elkng: how can I download html page using firefox from command line?
08:30 @Peng: Why?
08:30 @Peng: If it's just an HTML page, use curl or wget.
08:32  elkng: there is a javascript that generates me a list of links and any other tools like wget cant interprete javascript
08:32  elkng: I neet allready generated page
08:32  elkng: s/neet/need
08:35 @Peng: Ah. So you want to run JavaScript, then save the computed HTML. Sorry, dunno how. :-\

11:27  satdav: pulse00: ask in here
11:28  satdav: as some of us can help with it
11:28  satdav: also irc.mozilla.org might be better #thunderbird
11:36  pulse00: i'm having a problem with adding rss feeds with a non-trusted ssl certificate. when i add it, thunderbird simply says the certificate is untrusted. it doesn't give me the usual option to say "trust it anyway"
11:36  pulse00: make non-trusted "self signed"
11:48  Error404NotFound: can i change some setting so it doesn't confirm me when installing a new addon?
11:53 @Peng: No.
12:13  hyppias: on Win7: I regularly notice, that when I close down FF, it stays present in the Taskmanager as a process. Subsequently starting FF again, gives me an error message that FF is already running and first needs to be closed. Any suggestions ?
12:19 @Peng: How long are you waiting? It can take a littl while to shut down.
12:24  hyppias: @Peng: talking to me ?
12:31 @Peng: Yes.
12:37  fcukgifs: Hi, where are the about:config settings stored in my system ? I need to edit them manually,

14:42  xbskid: I really, really need to get used to there no longer being a New Tab option at the top of the tab bar context menu.
14:43  xbskid: Already I've habitually selected the first option, and waited for a new tab to appear, only to find out that, crap, I've reloaded an existing tab.
14:47  delby: hi. where is the best place to make system wide changes to firefox/iceweasel? the files i came across  /usr/share/iceweasel/browserconfig.properties  /etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js  /etc/iceweasel/profile/prefs.js . i know some of them are iceweasel/debian specific, but generally i want to know whether to use browserconfig.properties or one of the .js files.
14:52  pulse00: anyone knows how to add rss feeds with self-signed ssl certificates?
14:52  pulse00: *to thunderbird
15:09  Roey: hi
15:10  Roey: is there a way to get Fx's URL auto-complete feature to work like in Chromium (i.e., not popping up a drop-down box but instead completing the closest match)
15:14  rjohnson19: Roey: so you don't have to press down to select a match? https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enter-selects/
15:15  Roey: thanks
15:15  Roey: rjohnson19:  does it auto-complete for me?
15:16  rjohnson19: if you have firefox 4, you can use https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozilla-labs-prospector-speak-/ which does the kind of autocomplete you are looking for, I think
15:18  Roey: hmm ok thanks
15:19  Roey: rjohnson19:  thanks! Also, is there some extension that adds a button on the URL bar to clear it?
15:19  Roey: rjohnson19:  I remember there being one but I cannot recall its name
15:20  rjohnson19: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurlbutton/ ? addons.mozilla.org has search you know ;)
15:21  rjohnson19: looks like it isn't maintained though, not compatible with anything later than 3.0a1..
15:41  HS^: your browser is completely broke.
15:41  HS^: it doesnt work
15:42  HS^: i go to any site and it says "not responding"
15:45  HS^: when i click on network in options dialog ...
15:45  HS^: it crashes also
15:57  Cursarion: how do I disable Ctrl-q?
15:58  delby: where can i find info about browserconfig.properties? for example what can be set there and how.
