02:24  qorep: can I disable javascript alerts that comes up when I close a tab?
02:24  qorep: like "Are you sure you want to leave? Ok to stay Cancel to continue"
02:25  qorep: example, this place: http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1771/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html
02:26 @dolske: no, but we're improving them for Firefox 4.
02:27 @kbrosnan: you would need to disable js globaly
02:27 @kbrosnan: or noscript
02:29  zulax: on linux, where does FF store lso files? do they have .lso extensions?
02:31 @kbrosnan: context?
02:32 @dolske: itym Flash cookies, those are stored by Flash not Firefox.
02:33  zulax: okay, so its in Flash directory
02:33  zulax: no wonder i cant find it inside firefox
03:56  gilaniali: I am trying to run an extension but it says Run --fix-permissions first. I am on Mac OS X. Is this a firefox thing, if so then how do i fix it
04:00  jag: I'm using beta 6...I just switched back to firefox from chrome, and it seems a whole lot more buggier than it used to be. Is this supposed to be the case with the beta? I mean, I get all these problems with the aero malfunctioning and rendering the window messed up, and then tabs freeze up often, and flash videos are laggy, and all sorts of problems
04:10  bacrous10lee: :)hello Mozilla supports IRC
04:59 @kbrosnan: gilaniali: fix disk permissions is an osx disk utility http://kb.iu.edu/data/aoxn.html

05:31  w0lfshad3: they say xmarks is going to shut down next year, any alternatives like it for firefox?
05:32  rryouumaa: i started firefox and got a little splash screen that went away immediately.  it looked a little like the add-on window with yellow and white.  how do i find out what happened?
05:33  rryouumaa: it did /not/ happen when i did another profile, which is very concerning.  i have been wondering if i have a malware just recently, so i'
05:33  rryouumaa: d like to just know that it's not an issue by looking up what ff just did.
05:33  rryouumaa: comments?
05:59  w0lfshad3: stop being paranoic and install an antivirus to be paranoic for you :D
06:00  rryouumaa: on a mac?
06:01  rryouumaa: s/paranoiac/cautious/g
06:01  w0lfshad3: that was probably the ff autoupdate window
06:01  rryouumaa: i think it's good when software keeps logs of what it does
06:01  w0lfshad3: macs don't have malware? oO
06:01  rryouumaa: dunno if they have antivirus
06:02  w0lfshad3: sure they do, lemme google one for you
06:02  rryouumaa: i'd like to know if they have malware
06:02  w0lfshad3: http://www.iantivirus.com/
06:02  rryouumaa: i am relatively new to mac, so i don't know whether such things are worthwhile etc.
06:02  w0lfshad3: google for: "free mac antivirus" :P
06:03  w0lfshad3: they aren't worthwhile, but it depends
06:03  rryouumaa: on?
06:03  w0lfshad3: after a long time i learned that's safer to keep an antivirus around to be sure
06:04  w0lfshad3: that way it doesn't depend very much and i'm not worrying about it anymore :)
06:04  w0lfshad3: "use the right tool for the job"
06:04  w0lfshad3: guessing isn't the right tool obviously :D
06:06  rryouumaa: ok.  still, it'd be nice if there is an ff log.
06:19  w0lfshad3: look at files with modified date around the time in question
06:19  w0lfshad3: if it was in Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\updates
06:19  w0lfshad3: it was just an update
06:19  w0lfshad3: you can do that with windows search :D
