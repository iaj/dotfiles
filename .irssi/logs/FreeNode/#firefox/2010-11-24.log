03:08  bikcmp: Hi all, how can I get the status bar back in firefox 4?
03:08  xangua: view menu>shot>status toolbar
03:08  bikcmp: (connecting to blah.com, transmitting data to blah.com, etc)
03:08  xangua: or something like that
03:09  bikcmp: i did that.
03:09  bikcmp: it just brings up a blank bar, nothing in it.
03:17  Tannerbaum: bikcmp: it's been removed in Firefox 4.0
03:26  Tordek: hi
03:27  Tordek: I updated from 3.5 to 3.6, and all my toolbar bookmarks are invisible
03:28  Tordek: if I go to "Organize bookmarks", they're there, and if I add a new one, it shows up. It even shows up in the right place. but the other ones are invisible
03:50  Gryllida: Tordek: Try safe mode http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode

03:52  Gryllida: bikcmp: What version are you using?
03:52 @kbrosnan: said Firefox 4
03:58  Tordek: ugh... it seems they go invisible when I put them in the menubar and hide it with the Hide Menu extension...
03:58  Tordek: thanks, tho

04:00  pronto: i'm looking for firefox-4.0b3.tar.gz but unable to find it
04:02 @kbrosnan: why?
04:02  pronto: because i updated to pre7 and can't stand it
04:02  pronto: rather just go back to pre3
04:02 @kbrosnan: it is 5 months out of date.
04:02  pronto: and a load better in my opionion
04:03 @kbrosnan: did you try any of the firefox troubleshooting steps
04:03 @kbrosnan: such as firefox's safe mode or creating a second profile?
04:03  pronto: it works just fine
04:03  pronto: my main issue is that f6 is broken
04:04 @kbrosnan: so put tabs on bottom
04:04  pronto: huh?
04:04  pronto: i feel stupid now
04:04 @kbrosnan: uncheck tabs on top

04:06  pronto: not as big as an issue - but when you hover over a URL is there a way to have it be back on the bottom?

04:45 --- Tannn3r|away is now known as Tannn3r
04:46  xangua: there was an addon called publicfox that block fx with a pasword to avoid modify preferences, addons, etc
04:46  xangua: don't know if still exists
04:46  mrangry`: it would seem not
04:49  xangua: yes it does

04:54  mrangry`: oh
04:54  mrangry`: awesome
05:16  internetishard: hey, would iotop know if firefox is really writing to disk? I put firefox's cache in RAM, would iotop still display it under disk writes?
05:19  Gryllida: Ask iotop? If it's going to RAM, it's unrelated to disk write though.
05:20  internetishard: Well why is iotop showing excessive writes from firefox if I have it using a ram cache and I have cache.disk.enable as false?

08:27  impulse32: refreshing never helps..

13:25  sakhi: I have an FTP server with .docx documents and when I download the files with Firefox I am able to read them but when I download using IE I get them as .zip and I cannot the documents.
13:25  sakhi: anyone had this problem before?
13:29  Cork: sakhi: that sounds like it might be broken mime encoding, or ie's mime sniffer acting up
13:29  Cork: sakhi: anyway, isn't this asked in the wrong channel? :D
14:53  ghoti: There are a couple of web sites I log in to frequently that Firefox doesn't offer to remember passwords for.  They're not listed in the "Exceptions - Saved Passwords" list.  Any idea how I can figure out why they're not being stored?
14:55  ghoti: Oh - I see...  at least in one case, they're pulling a fast one witht the login form, and writing it out using Javascript.  :(  (www.arin.net)
15:30  pif: hi, can FF use an ssl proxy?

18:00  MrNibbles: hey utys
18:00  MrNibbles: guys*
18:01  MrNibbles: can anyone tell me why returning false from an arrowkey keydown event would not prevent firefox from scrolling?
18:01  MrNibbles: i am on the verge of removing my firefox sticker from my laptop here
18:01  MrNibbles: works perfectly in all other browsers...
18:02  MrNibbles: even with the random differences in keycodes..
18:03  mueslo: Hi, I'm having a problem with Fx 4b7 (64-bit) on 64-bit openSUSE
18:03  mueslo: The interface itself seems to still be working insofar as it is displaying animations (tab loading, website animations etc)
18:03  mueslo: but no matter where I click, nothing happens
18:04  mueslo: Also when I close firefox, it keeps running , so I have to manually kill it
18:04  mueslo: I don't think I installed anything before it happened
18:04  mueslo: Just from one moment to the next
18:05  mueslo: (keyboard shortcuts also don't work)
18:08 @kbrosnan: mueslo: does the behavior change in Firefox's safe mode or a new profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+troubleshooting
18:08 @kbrosnan: MrNibbles: have a demo?
18:09  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: i can knock one up, give me 1 min
18:10  mueslo: okay, disabling all addons lets it work in safe mode
18:11  mueslo: I'll just try one by one
18:12  mueslo: thanks :)

18:12  MrNibbles: you will see that you can scroll the results pane with the keyboard in firefox
18:12  MrNibbles: but you cannot in other browsers
18:13  MrNibbles: this is using FF 3.6.12
18:14  MrNibbles: if you have any pearls of wisdom on how i can disable this in ff i will happily keep the FF sticker on my laptop ;)
18:15  MrNibbles: i am writing a bookmarklet, and it is imperative that i can prevent keyboard scroll
18:17  MrNibbles: actually
18:17  MrNibbles: i think i have just sorted it
18:17  MrNibbles: looks like firefox binds its scroll action to onkeypress
18:17  MrNibbles: instead of onkeyup / onkeydown
18:20 @kbrosnan: maybe http://www.mozilla.org/editor/key-event-spec.html would be helpful to read
18:22 @kbrosnan: i'm not able to scroll horizonatally using the keyboard
18:23  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: thanks, but i have discovered the problem now
18:23  MrNibbles: you need to be using 3.6.12 to see the problem
18:24  MrNibbles: kbrosnan:  you also need to click the bottom right frame first to give it focus
18:25 @kbrosnan: i did that, in 3.5.16, 3.6.12, and trunk
18:25  MrNibbles: on which platform?
18:25 @kbrosnan: windows
18:25  neruda: hello
18:26 @kbrosnan: hi
18:26  neruda: i need some firefox portable schooling
18:26  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZVxdN/
18:26  MrNibbles: i am still getting the issue
18:26  neruda: are there any/many significant diffs between the traditional install and the portable app
18:26  MrNibbles: this is the old code
18:27 @kbrosnan: portable is not a Mozilla product
18:27  neruda: kbrosnan:  i see
18:28  tripelb: I would like to change the sound of an error -- Ubuntu 10.04 in firefox
18:28  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: actually, if i let the window loose focus, then give it focus again, the scroll is now prevented...
18:28  MrNibbles: this is really off
18:28  MrNibbles: odd
18:31  tripelb: I want to have 100 results in google. I select that in search settings and it says "your preferences have been saved" but it does not work. This ever since google instant came out. --- I am in Ubuntu 10.04 --- it DOES work in windows.
18:32  tripelb: I am looking where the light is. I have written to google soon after it happened.
18:34 @kbrosnan: tripelb: might have a corrupt cookies file, the directions at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cannot+log+in+to+websites#Remove_corrupt_cookies_file explain how to reset it
18:35  tripelb: I will try it. It is the same problem in chrome.
18:35  tripelb: thanks kb
18:39  tripelb: I did clear history now and included clear cookines. I let it all go. and reset google search prefs. still does it like that.
18:40  tripelb: wait, thare is another method. I'll do that too.
18:45  tripelb: kbrosnan, I did it. Still did not work.
