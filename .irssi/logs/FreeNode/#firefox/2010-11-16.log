02:56  mynameisdeleted: it looks like mobile browser wars are a lot warmer than desktop browser wars
02:56  mynameisdeleted: 7 players have over 5% each with no player having over 25%
02:57  mynameisdeleted: what are the stats on mobile browsing vs tablet vs laptop/desktop browsing?
02:58  mynameisdeleted: a lot of people prefer to use a smartphone or a tablet over a computer when they can
02:58  mynameisdeleted: as more devices like microwaves, and car navigators become smart-phone like, the importance of desktops may decrease
03:01  dolske_: spread out on mobile devices, sure, but I'm not worried about a radical shift to microwave-computing. :)

13:00  sergeykish: Hello, I have a question regarding firefox 'Accept-Charset' header. The default was "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7". I've set "intl.charset.default;utf-8", now it become "utf-8,*". It accepts all with same priority. Is it right?
13:06  eigar: when entering this page in FF I get blank page / no content - with wget I get the content. How come? How to investigate what is going wrong? http://www.askapache.com/dreamhost/wget-header-trick.html
13:07  eigar: FF 3.6.12
13:07  eigar: linux
13:08  eigar: have tried with restart of browser + differen / clean profilwe
13:08  eigar: *profile
13:09  eigar: is there some debug mode where one can see all traffic being passed. I could use wireshark but there are quite a load on other traffick going on...
13:22  shmithers: Hey guys I've got this really small but annoying problem. On my bookmarks toolbar I keep getting this "Bookmarks" button that I don't want. When I start from a fresh profile it's not there, I can't seem to pinpoint what is causing it to show up. I'm running 3.6.12 on Windows with the following addons at the moment: http://pastebin.com/cthKrM0
13:22  shmithers: Any Ideas?
13:23  shmithers: Oh, and here is a link to the Bookmarks button I am talking about: http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/5808/wtf1.jpg
13:31  shmithers: Any userChrome.css edits I could make to get rid of this? I'm not a huge scripter myself so I don't know how to do these things.
13:32  shmithers: I'm kind of baffled how there is 122 people here and yet no answers...
13:36  shmithers: ???
13:36  shmithers: Am I the only one here?
13:37  shmithers: Ah blast the link to the pastebin is broken: http://pastebin.com/cthKrM0B
13:37  ss: Edit your toolbar
13:37  shmithers: yeah
13:37  shmithers: done that
13:37  shmithers: its stuck right in my "Bookmarks Toolbar:
13:38  shmithers: or rather "Bookmarks Toolbar Items"
13:39  shmithers: The button goes before all the Bookmarks no matter how hard I try to seperate them
13:47  shmithers: http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4638/wtf2j.jpg   you can see here I am editing the toolbar, and the bookmaks toolbar button thing is still there. Even when I drag (shown by arrow, my mouse doesnt show up) you can see that they are all once peice for some strange reason.
13:49  shmithers: I've spent over 2 hours trying to fix this, and yet still nothing.
13:50  shmithers: When I restart firefox, the bar isnt there for a second, then something seems to make it appear shortly after
13:56  shmithers: Haha im trying irc.mozilla.org. I hope they are active there
