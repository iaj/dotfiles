00:46  norbert_: hi, I'm checking out a website with Firefox 4.0b7 and the page is supposed to show a video, but it's showing an "X" instead of the video; I can right click and pick "View Video" but then an external player starts
00:46  norbert_: webpage in question is http://www.html5-games.org/
00:47  norbert_: anyone know what could be causing this, and how I can make the video work?
00:48  norbert_: the code is: <video src="games/0000001/0000001.ogv" width="240" height="160" controls preload="meta" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'></video>
01:06  norbert_: I found the solution
01:06  norbert_: I added to .htaccess the line: AddType video/ogg .ogv
01:07 * norbert_ is happy

04:18  brick: anyone know how to change FF's "serif" font in linux? even the advanced button doesn't let me pick an actual typeface, so where is it being set?
04:19  Cork[home]: what do you get when you push the advance button?
04:20  Cork[home]: it should give you a dialog with dropdowns for optional fonts
04:28  brick: oh, how interesting
04:28  brick: thanks for making me look again Cork[home]. the "Proportional" menu has no actual fonts in it, but "Serif" does.
04:30 @kbrosnan: the fonts section is only used when the website does not specify a font
04:32  brick: "Allow pages to choose their own fonts..."
04:34 @kbrosnan: if that is checked the website's fonts have preferenc
04:37  brick: yap
04:38  brick: i need a better font picker
04:39  brick: i have mostly decorative fonts installed so picking one by name from a list is murder
04:45  ekaj: is it true that mozilla is just slightly slower than internet explorer?

04:55  richo: I'm running firefox 4, I want to add a custom search provider (Specifically, I want it to work as a searck keyword in pentadactyl if that changes anything) is there an easy way to do it? It's rpetty simple in chrome and this is one of the main things holding me back from switching
04:58  richo: Also, is there a tabkit equivalent that works with ff 4?
04:58 @kbrosnan: richo: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Smart keywords
04:58  richo: thankyou
04:59  richo: Hrm
04:59  richo: this means I'm going to have to write a dummy page with a form I guess?
05:00  richo: There's no way to just add it manually with a keyword substitution in the URL?
05:01 @kbrosnan: set the keword in the bookmarks library and add %s to the spot in the search url with the query
05:02  richo: kbrosnan: Exactly what I was after. Thanks.

06:42  Hilton: I've been having difficulty lately with websites telling me that my cookies are disabled. Some recent work in PHP has confirmed this - no cookies get set for session data, nor do I seem to be able to set any cookies. But when I go into Options>Privacy, Accept cookies is enabled.
06:43  Hilton: Using Firefox 3.6.13, Win XP Pro
06:44  Hilton: How can I find what the problem is?
06:47  zjblabs: firefox STILL doesn't wait for the previous instance of firefox to die before it attempts to update
06:47  zjblabs: STILL
06:48  zjblabs: damn, the we-need-a-1px-minimum-width-for-a-mousover-target-to-leave-fullscreen-mode stupidity was fixed, thank god
