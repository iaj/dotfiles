00:41  DanaG: er, more specifically: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API#Complete_Example:_Creating_a_Web_Based_Tone_Generator
00:41  DanaG: It's not working.  Error console reports "invalid argument".
00:42  DanaG: er, "invalid arguments"/
00:42  DanaG: On the float32array creation.

15:22  lint1: Hi everybody! I'm using Firefox 3.6.13 now. Since last update it seems to be that @font-face doesn't work - fonts is displaying by default. But before update everything works correctly. CSS: http://pastebin.com/aU9Xpe6T Any ideas how to fix it?
15:40  holicow: anybody has problems with logging in to gmail with 3.6.x in a standard view?
16:04  aviraldg_: firefox: Hi.
16:04  aviraldg_: anyone there?
16:05  aviraldg_: I'm having trouble building Firefox ... could anyone help?
16:05 @Peng: Just curious, why do you want to do that?
16:06 @Peng: aviraldg_: Anyway, you're more likely to find help elsewhere -- /topic
16:06  aviraldg_: actually I went to #firefox on irc.mozilla.org
16:06  aviraldg_: but no one was there
16:07  aviraldg_: so I came here
16:07 @Peng: Nobody was there?
16:07  aviraldg_: well, a couple of people (~5)
16:07  aviraldg_: but no one responded
16:07 @Peng: It does indeed look like nobody is active there right now, but it's much busier than this channel.
16:07  aviraldg_: ?
16:08 @Peng: What?
16:08  aviraldg_: I've been there several times
16:08  aviraldg_: on several days
16:08  aviraldg_: and I've *never* seen *any* traffic
16:08 @Peng: Apparently you're coming at bad times.
16:08  aviraldg_: oh
16:08 @Peng: And this time you only stayed for 2 minutes.
16:09  aviraldg_: umm
16:09  aviraldg_: yeah
16:10  aviraldg_: anyway, I got mozilla-central
16:10  aviraldg_: and followed the instructions for building firefox
16:10  aviraldg_: I did get a successful build
16:11  aviraldg_: and a directory called "obj-i686-pc-linux-gnu" with the binary
16:11  aviraldg_: but I can't get it to run
16:11 @Peng: Go on.
16:12 @Peng: You're not trying to run ./firefox-bin directly, are you?
16:12  aviraldg_: I am
16:12  aviraldg_: why?
16:12 @Peng: aviraldg_: Because it won't work. Run the ./firefox shell script.
16:12  aviraldg_: where?
16:13  aviraldg_: obj-i686-pc-linux-gnu/browser/app/firefox ?
16:13 @Peng: I don't know where it is; I don't know anything about the build process. I would expect the documentation to explain.
16:14  aviraldg_: oka
16:14  aviraldg_: *okay
16:15 @Peng: Docs say: On a non-Macintosh build system, the finished build can be found in objdir/dist/bin. On POSIX platforms (BSD, GNU/Linux, Solaris), you should run the file "mozilla" or "firefox", not the binary "mozilla-bin" or "firefox-bin".
16:15  aviraldg_: I ran the firefox script and I got:
16:15  aviraldg_: Cannot find Minefield runtime directory. Exiting.
16:16 @Peng: As I said, I don't know a thing about the build process. Sorry. :\
16:16  aviraldg_: okay
16:16  aviraldg_: thanks anyway
16:16 @Peng: There really usually are people on irc.mozilla.org. More people than here, anyway.
16:17  aviraldg_: hmmm
16:18  aviraldg_: I'll try in 12 hours then
16:18  aviraldg_: maybe it's the time
16:26 @Peng: Plus it's the weekend.
16:30  aviraldg_: yeah
