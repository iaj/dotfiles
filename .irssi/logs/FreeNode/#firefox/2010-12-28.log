01:02  Huvet: hi! I get all sorts of strange context menu rendering with firefox 4 beta 8, is this a known problem? http://twitpic.com/3jnlm4 - http://twitpic.com/3jnlxk
01:11 @kbrosnan: Huvet: checked firefox's safe mode or a new profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+troubleshooting
01:13  Huvet: no, I probably should. problem is, it happens only momentarily, haven't been able to reproduce reliably

03:15  HilBilly: question on managing passwords on firefox/ubuntu.  Support says to go to edit/preferences/privacy and there is supposed to be a manage passwords tab.  Not on my version however.  How can I delete specifics passwords?
03:16  Cork[home]: HilBilly: not a tab, a button
03:16  Cork[home]: and its security not privacy
03:16  HilBilly: ok .. but it is not under the privacy tab.
03:16  HilBilly: ok

03:18  HilBilly: under security, I have a button with a check box that says "Remember Passwords" ... and a button that shows "Exceptions"
03:18  HilBilly: But no manage passwords button
03:19  Cork[home]: the last button in the list
03:19  HilBilly: My problem is with "ghosts of girlfriends past" and girlfriend present seeing such info
03:19  HilBilly: ahhhh ... now I see it
03:21  HilBilly: That fixed it ... could save me some really cold shoulders.
03:22  HilBilly: One other password issue I am having is that it refuses to save one of my email accounts on gmail.  It saved all the others.  I MAY have clicked never on this site or something.  Anyway to encourage it to save the missing one?
03:35 @Peng: HilBilly: Well, you can check the Exceptions list to see if you did indeed click Never sometime.
03:39  HilBilly: nothing under exceptions.
03:39  HilBilly: Already tried that.
