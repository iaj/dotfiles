12:14  dD0T: And the firefox.com/m redirects to http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/m which 404s. The right page would be, as you noted, http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/m
12:15  Gryllida: I'll report that. Thanks.

12:50  chao: Why when I download Firefox for Android from the official website it is still branded Fennec?
12:51  chao: I thought the branding switched to Firefox back in 2009.
13:08  Taurui: Cork, I fixed it with another profile creating method in argyllcms :)

14:16  jolo: hi
14:17  Gryllida: Hi jolo.
14:17  jolo: are there x86_64 version binaries of ff 4b7?
14:17  Cork: linux and mac, but not windows
14:18  Gryllida: Not at another place than the 3.6.x 64bit ones, I assume.
14:18  Gryllida: They're unofficial.
14:18  Cork: well there is nightlies for win64, but they won't make it for ff4, its for later releases
14:19  jolo: ah found it on ftp.mozilla.org
14:19  temhawk: hi, i have a weird problem. when i browse my website and look at the HTTP headers, i see that on every page i request, my browser makes two GET requests for one and the same image. the second one is a few seconds later and takes longer to download, at least that's what i can tell from Firebug's net graphs. can anyone make sense of this?
14:22  jolo: thx
14:22  jolo: bye
14:50  temhawk: it only seems to happen in Firefox btw. i checked in Safari and there is only 1 HTTP request for the same image

15:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o gavin_]
15:43  S_A: kbrosnan: is there some place where it copies the add-on after installing ? what if i remove that manually ??
15:44 @kbrosnan: S_A: that can remove the extension
15:45  S_A: kbrosnan: reason is that I am trying to use rkiosk add-on in firefox for kiosk mode of my OS. but I have normal desktop mode also. I want user to use firefox normally in desktop mode
15:45 @kbrosnan: but you would need to re-install to get it back, which sounded like one of your requirements
15:46  S_A: do you have some suggestion for my requirement ??. How to achieve that
15:47 @kbrosnan: maybe two seperate profiles. if you don't need data like bookmarks and history to be in sync
15:48  S_A: hmm
15:48  S_A: that sounds like a good idea
15:49  m4D_: hello. any ff-developers (win32) here?
15:49 @kbrosnan: S_A: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Command_Line_Options#User_Profile
15:50 @kbrosnan: m4D_: please ask your question. if a dev needs to get involved they can.
15:51  m4D_: i wonder if there is any reason why createremotethread doesn't work. any hooking applied?
15:52 @kbrosnan: as an extension?
15:52 @kbrosnan: trying to update for firefox 4?
15:53  m4D_: as an way of running dll-injected code
15:53  ziga: Hello - I'm experiencing something weird, when i'm hitting fresh cached content, firefox still does conditional requests to make sure the content has not been updated, is this normal ?
16:02 @kbrosnan: m4D_: not sure, might be better to ask at https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-platform
16:02 @kbrosnan: checked bugzilla but did not see anything similar to what you are asking

16:08  gdoteof: can i flush the dns on firefox without a plugin?
16:08  gdoteof: i have someone that needs to flush a stale record out of their ff, it's working fine in other browsers
16:08  gdoteof: but i don't want to have them install a plugin if it's avoidable
16:10 @kbrosnan: gdoteof: toggle file > work offline
16:11 @kbrosnan: you also may need to clear the os level dns cache if they have one
16:11 @kbrosnan: ipconfig /flushdns as an admin on Windows
16:15  Colonel_Panic: Hey, I just installed Ubuntu 10.4 over my old Debian installation, and now FF has no menu bar
16:15  Colonel_Panic: or rather, it's there, I just can't see it unless I roll over it
16:15  Colonel_Panic: also, I need to install my Flask plugin for 64-bit
16:15  Colonel_Panic: Flash
16:17  gdoteof: kbrosnan: ah cool trick
16:17  Colonel_Panic: any ideas?
16:17 @kbrosnan: Colonel_Panic: flash should be in the package manager
16:17  Colonel_Panic: I can only see the menus when I click on them
16:17 @kbrosnan: #ubuntu should have some details
16:18  Colonel_Panic: 64-bit Flash?
16:18  Colonel_Panic: OK
16:18 @kbrosnan: i don't know
16:18 @kbrosnan: Gnome desktop?
16:19  Colonel_Panic: I see a "flash plugin installer"
16:19  Colonel_Panic: we'll see if that works
16:20  Colonel_Panic: OK that worked!
16:20  Colonel_Panic: On to the next issue
16:20  Colonel_Panic: The menus .look fine in all other applications
16:22 @kbrosnan: if you are using a non-default gtk theme there are some that cause issues
16:23  Colonel_Panic: lemme check that
16:25  Colonel_Panic: OK yeah it's the theme that's doing it.
16:25  Colonel_Panic: OK thnks all
16:25  Colonel_Panic: you've been helpful, as usual
17:00  temhawk: found out the root of my problem. it's the YSlow addon
