00:00  andrewh192: i have downloaded the sunbird-1.0b1.tar.bz2 file and can't remember how to "make" or compile all those files into a workable runable program
00:01  andrewh192: anyone here can help me...
00:01  andrewh192: i am reading this page: http://www.captain.at/howto-sunbird.php
00:02  andrewh192: and not really sure what its really saying to do
00:02  andrewh192: fyi, I am using Kubuntu 10.10 with KDE 4.5.3
00:02 @kbrosnan: try #calendar on irc.mozilla.org
00:02  andrewh192: kewl
00:02  andrewh192: thanx
00:03 @kbrosnan: though i don't know if standalone compiling is supported any more
00:03  andrewh192: is there a ppa that i could use
00:03  andrewh192: that would be easier
00:03  andrewh192: than i could just do the sudo apt-get command
00:04 @kbrosnan: no clue, #ubunutu people would be best to ask
00:04  andrewh192: ok

01:51  techrush: does FF4 beta7 have 3d acceleration on linux ?
01:57 @kbrosnan: techrush: i don't know if it is finished but the demos work fairly well with my system and Nvidia binary drivers
01:59  techrush: yea thats the confusing thing
01:59  techrush: i don't mean webGL 3d
01:59  techrush: i mean accelerating the rendering of pages
02:00  sdwilsh: the fisheye demos don't use webgl
02:00  sdwilsh: since ms put those out, and they don't implement webgl
02:47  domsz: hi, i'm about to file a bug report for FF 4.0b7
02:47  domsz: can somebody confirm this plz
02:47  domsz: http://www.phoboslab.org/biolab/index-blurry.html
02:47  domsz: http://www.phoboslab.org/biolab/index-crisp.html
02:47  domsz: canvas rendering on the first page is blurry, while it's crisp on the second one
02:48  domsz: the difference beeing, that the document is larger than the window (->scrollbars) in the first page
02:48  domsz: can you see the blurry/crisp difference as well?
02:49  gryllida: looking
02:49 @kbrosnan: can't say i do on linux
02:50  domsz: i guess it's an issue with the hw accel and how the page is composed!?
02:51  gryllida: canvas seems same to me (I'
02:51  gryllida: m on linux too)
02:51  gryllida: the images quality is same in both cases
02:52  domsz: is the title screen "pixel perfect"?
02:52  domsz: would you mind making a screenshot? :)
02:54  gryllida: domsz: http://s2.kimag.es/share/48714844.png
02:54  domsz: ok, thx. that is crisp :)
02:54  gryllida: This is how both pages look to me.

02:56  domsz: http://250kb.de/u/101111/p/RN1ImHlsuYb3.png
02:56  domsz: this is what it looks like for me
02:56  domsz: and i just realized that it's the other way around.. unlike the naming of the documents 0_o
02:58  LordCrc: domsz: fwiw i see it too, win7
02:58  domsz: ok, this is REALLY strange. unlike in the screenshots, the -crisp.html looks crisp and the -blurry.html looks blurry again
02:58  domsz: well thx!
02:58  LordCrc: domsz: the one with scroll == fine, other == blurry
02:59  domsz: yeah, it's really strange... it ... i don't know. it seems to switch!?
03:00  domsz: LordCrc: is your FF window maximized?
03:00  LordCrc: domsz: no
03:00  domsz: it switches whether it's maximed or not
03:00  domsz: ... okay
03:14  sedulous: the "back" function doesn't work anymore for me with Firefox 4.0 b7

04:27  dlynes: I guess Firefox 4.0b7 doesn't support WebGL?
04:29  rjohnson19: dlynes: it might still be disabled by default in b7, thats what the release notes say anyways.
04:29  rjohnson19: webgl.enabled_for_all_sites -> true in about:config
04:33  dlynes: rjohnson19, ah...why would they disable a feature by default that they're trying to promote?
04:34  dlynes: rjohnson19, but, actually...it's enabled
04:35  dlynes: rjohnson19, any website i go to that does autodetect of support says that my browser doesn't support it, however
04:35  rjohnson19: dlynes: it was just enabled by default in beta 7, after looking up the bug.
04:35  dlynes: webgl.force_osmesa is false, webgl.mochitest_native_gl, webgl.verbose are all false
04:36  dlynes: and webgl.shader_validator is true
04:36  rjohnson19: things like http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/lesson05/index.html have worked for me for awhile now
04:37  dlynes: Could not initialise WebGL, sorry :-(
04:39  dlynes: Is there something special that needs to be installed for it to work?
04:39  dlynes: It seems it doesn't work in Chrome, either
04:40 @kbrosnan: you need a 3d video driver
04:49  dlynes: Yeah...just realized that
04:49  dlynes: thanks
04:49  dlynes: Never actually tried doing 3d on this machine before

07:27  spektom: is there FF4 XULRunner available for download?
07:32 @kbrosnan: spektom: no you would be compiling from source
07:33 @kbrosnan: spandi: #thunderbird is on irc.mozilla.org i would guess it just involves grabbing your profile but not sure
07:34  spektom: kbrosnan: I guess invoking an existing build infra that fills-in http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/ is better than creating a new one (for 3 platforms) :)
07:34 @kbrosnan: i would not expect builds before firefox 4 final is out the door

10:00  sedulous: gryllida: FoxyProxy was the culprit, breaks Firefox 4.0b7
10:01  sedulous: i need to find another PAC management tool, maybe just write my own simple javascript
10:02  gryllida: 'PAC'?
10:05  sedulous: Proxy Auto-Config
10:05  sedulous: basically a javascript that decides which proxy to use for a given resource -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config
10:06  gryllida: Doesn't Firefox's builtin proxy settings panel (tools, options, advanced, networking, settings) do that?
10:06  gryllida: ok looking
10:06  gryllida: ah. maybe it doesn't.
10:06  sedulous: for example I'm using a SOCKS proxy for regular browsing and a HTTP proxy located in the UK for .*\.bbc\.co\.uk/.*
10:06  gryllida: sedulous: maybe you need to write to FoxyProxy developer about it.
10:07  sedulous: gryllida: PAC is cross-browser so I'm looking for a universal solution now
10:07  gryllida: it would need to be a program on your os, not a firefox addon.
10:07  sedulous: yes
10:08  sedulous: for my simple needs, I could just write the PAC javascript file directly

12:22  seria-mau: how can i get the statusbar back in b7?
12:25  OmNomSequitur: Yeah, I was about to ask.
12:25  OmNomSequitur: What a stupid design decision.
12:25  OmNomSequitur: People mouseover to see where a link points to.
12:26  seria-mau: yes and a progress bar for loading is missing
12:26  OmNomSequitur: In FF 4b7, you can't see where a link will take you.
12:26  seria-mau: hmm
12:26  seria-mau: try mouse over a link and then look at your url-bar
12:27  seria-mau: OmNomSequitur: that should fix your concern, i guess
12:27  OmNomSequitur: I know.
12:27  OmNomSequitur: But long links don't show up.
12:27  seria-mau: lol
12:27  OmNomSequitur: I want the goddamn status bar back.
12:28  seria-mau: thats a fail
12:28  OmNomSequitur: Long links are truncated.
12:29  OmNomSequitur: Depends on your screen res, obviously.
12:30  OmNomSequitur: At home (2048x1152) it's not a proble.
12:30  OmNomSequitur: At work, (1280x1024 twice) it is a problem.
12:34  OmNomSequitur: It just seems like Mozilla are just trying to be different.
12:35  mosva: Is there a Chrome OS like project with firefox?
12:35  OmNomSequitur: Heh, imagine an OS built on Gecko.
12:35  mosva: OmNomSequitur, which browser do you use?
12:36  OmNomSequitur: Mainly Firefox. Chrome when Firefox keeps crashing, IE for certain sites.
12:36  OmNomSequitur: It's about a 75/20/5 split.
12:37  Nomikos: Using last 4b7, can't get the status bar to show up. I'm reading it'll appear if there's addons that make use of it, but is there another way to at least make it show target urls on href hover?
12:37  AOLko: hi people
12:37  AOLko: is there gecko channel?
12:39  Nomikos: AOLko: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Getting_Started suggests irc.mozilla.org/developers
12:55  soju: Greetings ! I have just upgraded from FFb6 to FFb7 and my status bar disappeared
12:55  Nomikos: Ditto.
12:55  soju: I dont even remember if I had actual status bar. In any case, if I hover over a hyperlink, I cant see where it leads to
12:55  Nomikos: You could try https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/235283/ , maybe you have more luck than me
12:55  Nomikos: soju: the target url now appears in the location bar, on the right, in grey
12:56  soju: oh
12:56  Nomikos: I preferred the previous way where it showed in the status bar at the bottom of the window (yes, there was one there)
12:56  soju: hmm... I only have 1360 pixels width in my monitor
12:56  soju: That could be problematic
12:56  soju: but thank you for the link, I will try it ouy
12:56  soju: out*
12:57  Nomikos: It does get a bit cramped if your current and target url are long, yes :-/
12:57  Nomikos: So it just shortens both
12:58  Nomikos: It doesn't do much for me on OS X but then it does state "Fix location bar progress bar margins on Windows (7) and probably Mac"
12:58  soju_alt: Sorry, I apparently dc-ed just after getting your link
12:58  Nomikos: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/235283/
12:58  soju_alt: aye, will try it now. Thanks !
12:59  soju_alt: that said, I'd much prefer the old hovering status bar that gets out of the way when not needed instead of a real deal status bar that takes up precious screen space
13:00  soju_alt: err. wait
13:00  soju_alt: Nomikos, is this a conscious design change a bug ?
13:00  soju_alt: or a bug*

17:41  Polochon_street: How can I install ogg plugin for firefox?
17:41  Polochon_street: Because it's not in the tab "applications", in preferences
17:43 @kbrosnan: Polochon_street: there is no ogg plugin. firefox can nativly decode ogg
17:43  Polochon_street: Okay, so my html code don't work :/

17:44  Polochon_street: Here is my code
17:45 @kbrosnan: that is empty
17:45 @kbrosnan: and i don't know that native decoding of ogg works with object
17:45  Polochon_street: wtf

17:47  Polochon_street: http://pastebin.archlinux.fr/426063

19:12  M_o_C: Are there any reports concerning people not being able to make use of javascript on youtube due to some strange javascript errors / exceptions?
19:14  M_o_C: Because that's what I'm experiencing and disabling addons or resetting every setting to defaults doesn't help. (Though the latter did help the first time this occured)

19:23  Gary_B: ive run loads of spyware stuff, no reults, firefox 3.6.12
19:28  cm9: Gary_B: have you gone through your addons list and disabled any that don't seem like they belong?
19:29  Gary_B: can i disable XULRunner in AddOns?
19:30 @kbrosnan: xulruuner is not an addon. it is the core that Firefox runs on
19:30  Gary_B: @kbrosnan: should it be listed in AddOns then?
19:30 @kbrosnan: no
19:31  Gary_B: so that could be the root of my issue then?
19:31 @kbrosnan: no
19:31  Gary_B: its listed in my AddOns page
19:32  Gary_B: perhaps its malware masquerading under a legitimate sounding name

19:39  deeperror: Is there a way to make all pop-up's act as pop unders?  Or to control the focus so that it never leaves the main window or the window that prompted the popup?
19:50  Gary_B: disabling XULRunner from the extensions tab of addons stopped the link redirect issue, i tried enabling it again, the issue came back, and went away again on disable
19:51 @kbrosnan: yes, was going to mention that the version was a bit suspicous as 1.9.1 is the version for Firefox 3.5
19:55  Meshezabeel: I am in Yahoo mail composing a message, when I press CTRL-TAb to switch to my next tab (another website), and then press CTRL-tab again to switch back to my message, basically firefox is also thinking I am pressing "Tab" by itself, and will move focus from the message compose area to the Send button, it is getting really annoying. Anyone know why?
