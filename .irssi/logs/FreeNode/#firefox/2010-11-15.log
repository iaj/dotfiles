00:23  gryllida: sure

01:41  hackeron: is there anyway to get an "omnibar" in firefox like in chrome? - after using it in chrome for a while, I really miss it in firefox :(
01:42  xangua: there is the 'omnibar' addon
01:44  hackeron: xangua: oh, neat :)
01:45  hackeron: also, is there anyway to get the tab to use part of the title bar like in chrome?
01:45  hackeron: tabs I mean
01:46  xangua:   fx 4 beta for windows does
01:54  hackeron: I'm on a mac :(

02:00  gentooer: Hi. Using about:config I was able to force firefox to draw all websites with light-colored text on a black background. Is there any similar way to get text boxes to have light text on a black background?

12:57  AnxiousNut: I'm running firefox 4 b8pre and i have some addons installed. the thing is that every time i disable the addon bar, i notice that it's enabled the next time i launch firefox! Isnt there a way to permanently disable it, or is that a bug?
13:11  awircser: hi
13:12  awircser: is it possible to install duplicate addons?
13:13  gryllida: generally no
13:13  biopyte: i'm looking for a specific extension. A special kind of bookmark. Clicking that bookmark will not only open a single site, but a whole set of links stored in a folder or so. is there such a thing?
13:13  gryllida: yes, live bookmark
13:14  biopyte: thx
13:14  AnxiousNut: awircser, im no expert but i think that'll require changing some data within the source code and then make it an addon package and install it, but maybe there's an easier way
13:14  gryllida: yes, you need to do a rewrite, it's lots of effort, generallt not done
13:15  gryllida: different elements ids, different addon ids, .... you usually install only one version
13:15  AnxiousNut: i think find&replace would do
13:15  gryllida: some addons have a dozen of files to do that in
13:15  gryllida: and you don't always know what to search for
13:15  AnxiousNut: again, im not sure since i have never written an addon
13:15  gryllida: if you feel ok with debugging, then sure
13:16  AnxiousNut: ps: a script can do that to those dozens of files, just saying XD
13:16  gryllida: 2 addons add a button with same id
13:16  gryllida: the second one errors
13:16  awircser: Thanks AnxiousNut , gryllida
13:16  gryllida: you need to read
13:16  gryllida: and to debug
13:16  gryllida: ...
13:16  gryllida: generally that's not done , and no particulat reason to use duplicates
13:16  biopyte: gryllida, couldnt find that 'live bookmark' addon. is that the correct name?
13:17  gryllida: it is the name of firefox builtin feature
13:17  gryllida: news sites cllow you to add live bookmarks
13:17  gryllida: allow
13:17  biopyte: oh, i see
13:19  biopyte: grylidda, i dont think thats exactly what i need. i want to load with a single click a dozen of predefined links. dont need live updates of a single site.
13:23  gryllida: if you have several bookmarks in a folder
13:23  gryllida: you can click 'open all in tabs'
13:23  gryllida: right in the menu
13:26  biopyte: thats it, thx. however seems to be a bit buggy. doing so it closed all other links. thats actually more action than wanted. or is that a feature. anyway, i will get along with that solution.

17:35  aphadke: I am using Firefox 4.0b7, using gchat inside gmail causes the gchat font to become blurry and then it automatically sharpens itself.
17:35  aphadke: is this a bug pending fix or should i file one?

18:30 @kbrosnan: aphadke: if you disable accelerated graphics in tools > options > advanced > general and restart firefox. if that helps then it is a known issue
18:33  denysonique: When Fx will be fast?
18:33  denysonique: it is so slow!
18:34  denysonique: Firefox is slow
18:34  aphadke: denysonique:  did u try the beta?
18:34  denysonique: and Cr just sucks, it doesn't have an awesome bar
18:34  aphadke: kbrosnan:  thx, that fixed it… though i am now on minefield :)
18:34  denysonique: Firefox just should drop Gecko and use Webkit ;p
18:34  denysonique: aphadke, 4.0something, well yes, some time ago
18:35  aphadke: denysonique:  fx 4.0 b is really fast for me… u r having slow load times or its slow in general?
18:35  denysonique: aphadke, I am only talking about browsing pages. maybe I will try it again now
18:36  aphadke: denysonique:  give it a spin and let us know if its slow… we are working hard on building the best browser
18:37  denysonique: aphadke, btw I am also talking about Fx on GNU/Linux
18:37  denysonique: not the windows version which is faster
18:37  denysonique: aphadke, cool, on which part of it do you work?
18:37  aphadke: denysonique:  i work on the metrics side, socorro/crash-reports ….
18:38  aphadke: more on the backend infrastructure, we use hadoop/hbase out here…. my job is to make sure the systems are up adn running all the time and confirm that we don't lose any crash-reports etc.
19:03  denysonique: aphadke, actually it is quite fast
19:03  denysonique: <3 Firefox
19:03  aphadke: denysonique:  :-)
19:03  aphadke: yay
19:03  denysonique: and nice UI improvements;)
19:03  denysonique: ok I hope that from now on I will stop switching between Cr and Fx and stay only with Fx
19:03  denysonique: cheating on Fx didn't feel good
19:04  denysonique: I need close Cr now;)
19:13  denysonique: this is very weird
19:13  denysonique: http://denysonique.tk/screenshots/Mon_Nov_15_18.12.00_GMT_2010.png
19:13  denysonique:  Fx displays the image differently than Cr of Fx 3
19:14 @kbrosnan: denysonique: does the image have a color profile?
19:16  denysonique: kbrosnan, I can't remember. The Fx 4 that I am using is the download tarball from the site. I will see what the image would look like after I have natively compiled it on my Gentoo. And if it is bad then I will file a bug. I think this might be due to some png lib shipped in the tarball
19:16  denysonique: also my system has not been updated for a while.
19:43  beterraba: How to show only icons on firefox's favourites bar?
19:43  beterraba: ps.: on mac
