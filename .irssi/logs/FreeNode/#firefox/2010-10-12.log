11:58  Wizek: hi there
11:58  Wizek: Either Firefox badly handles mousein and mouseout events, or my JS is off. Could you help me find out which is the case?
11:59  Wizek: Because my site works just fine in Chrome
12:00  Wizek: here it is: http://humania.hu/The+five+levels
12:01  Wizek: If you use Firebug,
12:01  Wizek: you can see console.debug() lines, which tell either enter or leave, and a number which represents how many times one occured
12:02  Wizek: oh, and you trigger these console lines by moving your mouse around the top menu
12:03  Wizek: If you do so, you will recognise, that the counters start to mismatch after a while
12:03  Wizek: But not in Chrome
12:04  Wizek: (FF 3.5.10; Chrome 6.0.472.53)
12:44  clocKwize: hi
12:45  clocKwize: I'm producing an RSS feed, when I open it in firefox, it displays the rss feed stuff layout.. but doesn't show any items..but if I look at the source, they are there
12:45  clocKwize: and it shows in other browsers etc
12:45  clocKwize: any idaes?
13:11  ch077179: where does ff store certificates?
13:15  Cork: in your firefox profile
13:16  Cork: cert8.db to be precise
13:16  ch077179: thanks Cork
13:19 @kbrosnan: clocKwize: check the error console for parsing errors
13:20  clocKwize: there is a firefox console?
13:20 @kbrosnan: tools menu
13:20 @kbrosnan: also checking that your feed validates as xml
13:23  clocKwize: I've fixed it now anyway, but handy to know the console is there :)
13:23  clocKwize: thanks
15:22 --- shikitohno is now known as visiON_130
15:23 --- visiON_130 is now known as shikitohno
15:25  ch077179: ok, I did openssl s_client -connect myserver.com:443 |Tee-Object logfile and now I want to import that certificate into ff, and it asks me for the pwd which was used to encrypt the certificate.
15:26  ch077179: can I just rename the file in some way to make it readable by ff?
15:44  dPupUser10: anybody here able to view SVGs on web with Firefox ?
16:27  Quincy: Stupid errors: http://tinyurl.com/Clackie
16:46  poirot: hi, I was wondering what was the difference between a windowed and a windowless plugin; already googled but all I got was the same explanation copy/pasted through all wikis (that is too generic and hard to understand).
16:53  hesgoodboy: hello
16:54  hesgoodboy: can I modify the "save as" window of firefox somehow so that I can copy the path into it? e.g. I don't need to click to this folder anymore
16:57 @kbrosnan: hesgoodboy: firefox should use the standard file browser for the os
16:58 @kbrosnan: poirot: i believe that fullscreen plugins would be windowless
16:58  hesgoodboy: ok, I think I have to look up for a win xp chan :D
16:58  hesgoodboy: thank you kbrosnan
16:59  poirot: great
16:59  poirot: thanks

21:42  flowbee: is there a good way via chrome/firefox/wget to download all content on a site (say to a depth of 3-4 links, staying only on the domain).  the site requires a login/pass (which i have).
21:44  [algo]: hello
21:44  [algo]: is it ok that firefox eats more and more memory on single simple page ?
21:45  [algo]: the page executes few lines of js, adding and removing elements
21:45  [algo]: safe mode
