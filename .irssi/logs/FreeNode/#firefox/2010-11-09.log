10:00  Mr_O: hi
10:01  Mr_O: i have an issue with the lightning extention in thunderbird
10:02  UncleCJ: Hi all. My FF3 is behaving really funky, and I've created new profiles and there's very few addons which seem installed system-wide which could be causing it... can someone help me fix it?
10:03  Mr_O: lightning asked if i wanted to update a google calendar i subscribed to (wich is readonly). then on startup thunderbird ask for this calendar auth i have to cancel.
10:04  Mr_O: issue is that i have no local calendar anymore
10:05  UncleCJ: The symptoms are that for example I can type a URL in, but when I press enter, nothing really happens. Or that I click a link, and nothing happens. Also pages sometimes don't load properly, for example broken stylesheets
10:05  Mr_O: and only one of my 4 google calendar remain in the list
10:09  Mr_O: but i can see all my calendar events with no color
10:09  Cork: Mr_O: try asking in #thunderbird @ irc.mozilla.org
10:09  Cork: the likly hood that anyone know how to help you here is slim
10:11  Cork: UncleCJ: you should update ff3 isn't even supported anymore
10:14  Mr_O: i guess i could just remove the failing calendar from the advanced config tool but there is too many entries for one calendar
10:14  arvind_khadri: Hi, how does firefox know which field to map to Username when remember password is done.
10:16  Cork: arvind_khadri: the input name
10:18  arvind_khadri: Cork, in my code its taking the Password as the username. Am using FF4 and has div got anything to with this?
10:29  UncleCJ: Cork: Seriously, but there are so many addons which are not supported in FF4 yet?

11:05  sybariten: hey
11:05  sybariten: i "lose" my char encoding, seemingly w/o reason
11:05  sybariten: It happens after like an hour of use, or so
11:05  sybariten: Any ideas what i should google for?
11:09  pom: How do I change the color of the URL in the URL-field dropdown via userChrome.css?
12:44  UncleCJ: Cork: Seriously, but there are so many addons which are not supported in  FF4 yet?
12:46  UncleCJ: Official Firefox is 3.6 still, how can Cork say FF3 isn't supported?
12:47  UncleCJ: I'll ask again, FF3 UI is not responding like it should for me (under OS X), regardless that I create new profiles, any way I can track down that problem, like rip out system-wide conf?
12:57  arvind_khadri: Cork, by 3 he meant 3.0 not 3.x
12:58  arvind_khadri: UncleCJ, ^
13:07  UncleCJ: arvind_khadri: Ah, thx...
13:08  UncleCJ: arvind_khadri: Well, so FF36 :-)
13:08  UncleCJ: I'm gonna make another attempt to purify my FF36... :-)
13:10  pom: Is there a full reference for userChrome.css somewhere?
13:25  UncleCJ: Well, rephrasing my question, there's stuff in FF36 which is in ~/Library/Application Support which is not profile-specific, I guess? Or if something is installed from externally somehow, it goes into /Applications/Firefox?
13:26  UncleCJ: Yeah... I replaced everything, still have for example my ID card extension installed
13:29  UncleCJ: Not desired
13:57  UncleCJ: By the way, I'm trying out IronFox now, does anyone of you use it?
13:59  pSy|work: hi
14:00  pSy|work: We have a problem here with login/password fields autofilled by browser… it seems there is no javascript event (onChange?) then…
14:02  gryllida: pom, 'full reference'?
14:03  gryllida: UncleCJ, if 'uninstall' button is greyed out in addons manager, then it is a global extension. look its path in about:support, remove it by hand, and restart.
14:04  gryllida: about:support tells the name of the folder it's in, you can perform a system-wide search to find the path
14:04  UncleCJ: gryllida: Ah, excellent, thanks!
14:06  pSy|work: Is there any event triggered at login field autofilling?

14:51  n8whnp: When I check my web server's logs, it says: "kerb_authenticate_user entered with user (NULL) and auth_type Kerberos" ... is there any way to see what username or tickets the negotiate is sending
