01:18  BarkingFish: morning all.
01:19  BarkingFish: Firefox is apparently embarrassed :)
01:19  BarkingFish: I tried to reopen after a crash, and it says "Well, this is embarrassing...Firefox is having trouble recovering your windows and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page."
01:19  BarkingFish: anyone have any ideas what to do with this error?
01:27 @dolske:  it does that so you have a change to not reopen a page that might have been causing the crash.
01:28 @dolske: s/change/chance/
01:30  BarkingFish: the problem is the page i am trying to use has never caused a crash before in firefox, until i upgraded today from our new packages, now it just crashes it over and over
01:30  BarkingFish: I try to watch TV from Italy over Rai.it with the novell Moonlight plugin
01:31 @dolske: are you using Mozilla builds or what came with your distro?
01:32  BarkingFish: it comes with my distro, and gets updated by them too
01:42 @dolske: try a build downloaded from mozilla.com, that has crash reporting enabled, so you can go to about:crashed afterwards and... and you're gone. :/

05:01  crashsystems: nvm, it turns out sync saves account passwords in the FF password manager, and I had that set to clear passwords at exit.

12:29  nszeek: Hey guys, I am having a problem with my firefox (under gentoo). Everytime I lock the screen and come back (or when I don't use the computer for a long time) firefox stops auto-completing addresses on the url bar. So far I "correct" this by going to about:config and changing accessibility to 0 and then back to 1. Any ideas of what I could do ?
12:31  nszeek: correction, accessibility.typeaheadfind.flashBar to 0 and then back to 1

15:22  iCopter: why has plugin-container.exe (a firefox process) used 90% of my data allowance?
15:22 @gavin: what do you mean by "data allowance"?
15:22  iCopter: im on cellular, and get 2gb/ month
15:22  mavhc: is that where flash runs?
15:23 @gavin: yes
15:23  iCopter: ive only been on irc and a few blogs today, and its used 1400mb
15:23 @gavin: and other plugins
15:23 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 128 seconds
15:25 @gavin: assuming whatever does the per-process accounting is accurate, you probably need to blame the plugin
15:25 @gavin: not sure why any plugin would do that much data transfer, though
15:25  iCopter: since i ended the process, my bandwidth meter has gone back down to zero
15:25  iCopter: i suspect its DownloadHelper
15:26 @gavin: DownloadHelper wouldn't run in plugin-container
15:26 @gavin: it runs in firefox.exe
15:26 @gavin: oh, but it could be instantiating flash
15:26 @gavin: and that would happen in plugin-container
15:27 @gavin: odd that it would do that without telling you though!
15:27  iCopter: likely some rogue ad?
15:27  iCopter: despite having adblock installed
15:30  mavhc: install flashblock?
15:32  iCopter: hmm, none of my tabs were running flash
15:33 @gavin: how do you know?
15:34  mavhc: disable all your plugins
15:35  iCopter: pardon me, ive just seen a flash player error at the top of a page ( http://www.anandtech.com/tag/mb )  ive just changed "dom.ipc.plugs.enabled" to false via about:config
15:36 @gavin: why?
15:36  iCopter: -upon restarting firefox, will flash play normally without the plugin-container?
15:36 @gavin: that will make you lose the benefits of out-of-process plugins
15:36 @gavin: yes,but there's no garantee that that will solve the problem...
15:36  MrWax: Is there way I can get a good schematic view of my page (DOM wise) without the content but only the tag structure? in firefox?
15:36  iCopter: gavin: i really cant afford another mistake, its a simple fix for now
15:37 @gavin: how do you know it's a fix?
15:37 @gavin: it will get rid of plugin-container, but if the problem is actually flash, it will just make the problem harder to track down
15:38 @gavin: if you're doing it as a temporary diagnostic measure that's one thing, but you shouldn't assume that it will solve the underlying problem
15:38  iCopter: cause i see the crash in the bandwidth stream in my network analyzer after i closed the process, aswell as the flash player showing an error
15:38 @gavin: the presence of plugin-container is not necessarily in and of itself the problem
15:38 @gavin: that's the fault in your logic
15:38 @gavin: it may be that flash is doing that downloading
15:38 @gavin: and flipping that pref won't prevent flash from running
15:39  iCopter: sure, i understood that
15:39  iCopter: untill i restart the browser, then the problem may re-occur?
15:40  mavhc: leave it on, install flashblock, or disable flash
15:40  cousin_mario: Cursarion: I need them on the main profile
15:40  iCopter: actually, its not a temporary fix since it hasnt disabled flash
15:41  iCopter: (youtube works)
15:41  Cursarion: cousin_mario: plugins are installed on profiles separately
15:41  iCopter: mavhc, ok. will flashblock be able to prompt me instead of disabling completely?
15:41  mavhc: yes
15:41  cousin_mario: Cursarion: oh
15:41  Cursarion: ie., you can have plugins a, b and c on the main profile
15:41  Cursarion: and plugins d, e and f on the secondary profile
15:43  iCopter: nice. thanks for the help gavin, mavhc. much appreciated
15:43  cousin_mario: Cursarion: I have no "uninstall" option for the plugins
15:44  Cursarion: ooh, plugins
15:44  Cursarion: sorry, I was thinking about extensions :S
15:44  cousin_mario: yes, any idea?
15:45  cousin_mario: is it possible that when updated they also get re-enabled?
15:47 @Peng: I've had extensions updated and not reenabled.
15:48  cousin_mario: what about plugins?
15:48 @Peng: No idea
15:56  Cursarion: hmm
15:56  Cursarion: interesting way of handling things :P
15:56  Cursarion: why can't plugins be removed anyway?
16:02  MrWax: Is there way I can get a good schematic view of my page (DOM wise) without the content but only the tag structure? in firefox?
16:07  biopyte: i wish to download a set of 10 videos from youtube at once. how? scrapbook doesnt do the job, for whatever reason.

20:07  Industrial: the dialog has a checkbox "Do thuis automaticall for files like this from now on"
20:08  Industrial: I check it and press ok, open it with my bittorrent client (Transmission)
20:08  Industrial: then I open another .torrent file and I get the dialog again. Now the checkbox is checked.
20:08  Industrial: This is, to me, unexpected behaviour. What's the checkbox for if not (what i thought) preventing the dialog from opening again on .torrent files and just opening the files with Transmission ?
