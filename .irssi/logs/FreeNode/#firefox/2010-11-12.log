02:03  agentgasmask: Hi folks. I'm having a little dificulty opening pdf files in firefox. When I click on the link to the file (file is residing on my local machine, web page is a custom one) instead of promting me to choose to save or just open the file, it dumps a bunch of "code" on the browser window. The same webpage works on co-workers computers. Is there a setting that is out of place?

02:09 @kbrosnan: agentgasmask: you have a misconfigured server then
02:10 @kbrosnan: agentgasmask: it is telling firefox that it is sending a plain/text file
02:10 @kbrosnan: consult your server documentation about configuring mime types
02:11  agentgasmask: kbrosnan: I'm just opening the file with a: firefox file.html  at the terminal, so I guess it's not realy on a server?
02:22 @kbrosnan: firefox needs a web server for such files, if you don't have one then then you will get un-predictable results
02:24  gryllida: agentgasmask: To prove that, you can make a second Firefox profile, and a clean reinstall, after which the issue wouldn't be likely to disappear, if this is the server issue
02:31  agentgasmask: but I'm not using a server. I am only doing a File>Open>file.html from our NFS file server. Two other desktop workstations (without web servers installed) can open this page and the links work correctly (ie. they prompt to open or save)
02:43  agentgasmask: Is ther anything else it could be?
02:43 @kbrosnan: nope
02:48  agentgasmask: Well, obviously it is something else, I'll let you know what it is when I find it. Thanks
02:57  anon33_: for anyone else here running the minefield nightlies - are you having problems with cookies/logins being saved?
02:57  gryllida: works here
02:58  gryllida: your version info, describe the problem please
02:59  anon33_: Each time I quit firefox and reboot it - i lose all saved states. preferences stick except for how i'd like to manage history
02:59  anon33_: here's my user agent ( Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101111 Firefox/4.0b8pre )
03:00  anon33_: here's everything if you're interested - http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Cp5ZdT1K
03:01  gryllida: anon33: what if you look in tools, options, privacy, is it set to 'firefox will remember history'?
03:01  gryllida: aka edit, preferences
03:01  anon33_: gryllida: it will remember history, but if i change it to custom (with basic settings to remember everything), it forgoes that the next time at startup
03:01  anon33_: and reverts back to remember history
03:02  gryllida: so, preferences do not save for you?
03:02  anon33_: no, they do - just not history
03:02  gryllida: which preferences save?
03:02  anon33_: gryllida: all as far as i know
03:02 @kbrosnan: did you change any settings in that window? if you don't it will just revert to default
03:03  anon33_: kbrosnan: i mean i've changed a couple of things like how the downloads window is displayed, and that stays
03:04 @kbrosnan: but in the history window if you don't change anything there but the drop down then it will revert
03:05  anon33_: yup

03:05  enthdegree: would firefox and/or flash have to go through a fundamental structural redesign for you to be able to tab through flash elements without using your pointer to focus on the flash element?
03:07 @kbrosnan: enthdegree: as i understand it yes is the answer
03:08  enthdegree: but we must have some kind of hook/handle if we can at least focus on it with the mouse, right?
03:08  an_arc: how do i get firefox's popup blocker to work?
03:08  enthdegree: it's in preferences
03:08  an_arc: is it supposed to work?
03:09 @kbrosnan: enthdegree: as i understand it is brokering the return of focus that is difficult
03:09 @kbrosnan: an_arc: works in most cases, though there are a couple classes of popups it allows because of historical use
03:10  an_arc: i accidentally clicked on the background of a snopes page, and suddenly the browser window disappeared
03:10  an_arc: how do i stop this?
03:10  enthdegree: contact snopes and tell them to stop making their website suck
03:10  an_arc: enthdegree: so i should contact every website where this happens?
03:11  enthdegree: I wouldn't have a problem with it. (c:
03:11  enthdegree: Maybe we wouldn't have as many bad websites then.
03:11  an_arc: i would have a problem with contacting half of all websites
03:11 @kbrosnan: try setting dom.popup_allowed_events to blank in about:config
03:11  an_arc: i'm exaggerating, of course, but the idea is the same
03:12  enthdegree: Are you running it on Linux or something like it?
03:12 @kbrosnan: main reason I avoid snopes these days. their long running habit of using pop-under/overs
03:13  an_arc: enthdegree: windows xp
03:13  an_arc: kbrosnan: i cleared that option, now i find out if that breaks stuff (this will take a few weeks)
03:15  internetishard: hey, how could I find out why firefox gets sluggish after openning ~180tabs
03:15  enthdegree: Let's think about this for a moment.
03:15  internetishard: I've it running in a ram cache and it only shows firefox as using 10% cpu max
03:15  an_arc: internetishard: i really hate to say this, but... no app is designed for more than about 3 to 5 tabs
03:15  an_arc: firefox has trouble with, like, 20 tabs
03:16  internetishard: interesting
03:16  internetishard: What about firefox does that?
03:16  internetishard: It was very snappy up until about 120 tabs
03:16  internetishard: then I noticed a slow down
03:16  internetishard: Any way to give it more resources?
03:16  an_arc: are you using session manager?
03:17  enthdegree: internetishard: For that kind of number it is possible that firefox uses up all the ram that it is allowed to allocate for itself and then it has to use a pagefile on your hard drive (aka 'fake ram') instead of the actual kind.
03:17  an_arc: i suggest you just restart firefox and restore your session manager whenever it starts pausing
03:17  an_arc: er not 'your'
03:17  an_arc: i meant 'using'
03:17  enthdegree: buy a computer for every tab and then just switch computers as opposed to tabs.
03:17  enthdegree: it will fix the snappiness issue.
03:18  an_arc: i have about 500 tabs open, and firefox is probably going to crash today
03:18  enthdegree: Instead of having to wait for ff to switch tabs it will already be there. Like "Bam"
03:18  internetishard: an_arc, I am using session manager
03:18  an_arc: good, so you can restore what you were doing
03:18  internetishard: enthdegree: I have no swap, I've lots of ram
03:18  an_arc: i suggest you restart firefox every 2 to 3 days
03:19  an_arc: it just isn't stable at all
03:20  enthdegree: Wow, that's interesting. are you on plugin-intensive sites?
03:20  an_arc: me? no, i have all plugins disabled in my main profile
03:21  internetishard: Hmm, I only really have flash, and most of the tabs aren't using it
03:21  internetishard: I do have a lot of extentions though
03:22  internetishard: ABP, better privacy, fasterfox lite, flashblock, ghostery, google docs viewer, optimize google, session manager, spellechecker, user agent switcher...
03:23  an_arc: the issue here is that mobody ever tests firefox with more than a dozen tabs
03:23  internetishard: I wonder what the performance differences/demands are between allocating the entire profile directory to RAM vs just the cache
03:24  internetishard: an_arc, is that really true?
03:24  an_arc: memory leaks, freezing, everything goes right under the radar
03:24  internetishard: well it only is using 18% of my ram
03:24  internetishard: I'm trying to look at it via iotop to see if writes are the problem
03:24  internetishard: Not sure how to monitor it completely yet
03:24  an_arc: a program can use many times your physical ram before it starts to slow down
03:26  internetishard: I'm also suspicious since the firefox cache is only using 74 megs
03:28  internetishard: wow, session files are big... like 5megs each
03:28  enthdegree: from about:cache ?
03:28  internetishard: what is from...^?
03:29  enthdegree: where did you get the 74 megs number?
03:29  internetishard: the RAM cache dir
03:30  internetishard: browser.cache.disk.parent_directory uses it
03:30  internetishard: an_arc, I'm curious, since you seem to be browsing kind of like me, how do you deal with all of your old/gold-mine session files?
03:30  enthdegree: Huh, they both give the same information. about:cache is basically that reformatted
03:31  internetishard: oh shanp, didnt know about that 1
03:31  internetishard: Is offline cache only used when I'm not connected?
03:33  internetishard: I mean, is it written to a lot? Maybe I should put that one in memory too
03:41  internetishard: Is there a firefox dev channel?
03:41  internetishard: And can the offline cache also be safely stored in memory?
03:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o dolske]
03:47  internetishard: Well, something about what was stored in history was probably killing the performance, but iotop wasn't showing anything close to thrashing... so I'm not sure why a complete history clear and then restart of the 190 tabbed session made it ultra responsive again
03:56  an_arc: i'm not sure either, but restarting my 500-tab session does make it faster
03:56  an_arc: maybe there's a looping javascript on one of these pages
03:59  internetishard: .
04:12  gryllida: internetishard: ..
04:13  gryllida: internetishard: see http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_FAQs_:_About:config_Entries , look for 'cache' on that page
04:16  internetishard: why gryllida? I guess I've seen those settings before... Does this relate to something I've said specifically?

05:23  Cobratek: So ... I've managed to get thunderbird to open clicked links in a new firefox tab, now I need to get it to use a different display

05:46 @kbrosnan: only one instance of firefox can be running on any x server unless you use -no-remote
05:46  Cobratek: if I execute   firefox -new-tab -remote_openurl google.com   it will open a new tab on that display fine
05:47  Cobratek: my issue is getting it to do that accross my two screens
05:48  Cobratek: I get the 'firefox is already running' error when I do it on display:0.0
05:48  Cobratek: even when using the --display:0.1 switch
05:48  auscompgeek: you can only run one instance of Firefox at once without setting the no remote switch
05:49  Cobratek: im not trying to start a new firefox - hence the -new-tab and -remote_openurl  command
05:50  Cobratek: I can start a new tab all day on the same display
05:51  Cobratek: hehe that rhymed
05:52  Cobratek: anyway according to firefox --help I can use the --display=DISPLAY switch - it just wont do it
05:53  auscompgeek: did you try -no-remote?
05:53  Cobratek: it's likely a Xorg issue
05:53  auscompgeek: like kbrosnan suggested...?

05:59  Cobratek: if I move my FF window to the same display as TB - I can spawn tabs from links in my mail fine

06:08  auscompgeek: *would
06:09  Cobratek: yeah I've been trying all combinations I can think of, I dont think the --display= switch is working for me
06:09  Cobratek: firefox --display:0.0 google.com   has the same effect as firefox --display=0.1 google.com
06:10  Cobratek: opens int he same display
