00:06  mven: does firefox have something similar to this in their svn ? http://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css
00:06  mven: was unsuccessful in finding it :(
00:08  rjohnson19: mven: think https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/html.css is it
00:09  mven: yep looks like thats it. thanks!

01:39  Alphos: hi
01:41  Alphos: i'm using 3.6.13 on ubuntu 10.04, and after installing an extension ("It's All Text", supposedly allowing to edit textareas using a text editor), firefox does not seem to consider files properly : viewing any *.php url triggers a prompt asking me what i'd like to use to watch it
01:42  Alphos: uninstalling the extension did not help, by the way
01:45  Alphos: is there any way to tell it to use nothing and display the file as if it were a normal file (which it is) ? :D
01:47  Alphos: my bad, it's only on regular text/html php's... still doesn't explain how that could've occurred :D
01:53  Alphos: ok, reinstalling the extension, deleting all files extensions triggering the ffox extension, and uninstalling the extension again seems to work... boy was it weird >_<
01:54  Frosh: FF 3.6.13 - the bookmarks toolbar doesn't show the bookmarks, is that a bug?
01:57  xangua: is the toolbar bookmark element added to the (sic) bookmark toolbarÂ¿
01:58  Frosh: sic?
01:58  Frosh: like its there but invisible
01:58  Frosh: I see it in 'organize toolbar'
01:59  Frosh: Just wierd
02:01 --- boonhead is now known as bh-off
02:02  xangua: restore defaul toolbar settings ;)
02:03  wolfric: is there anyway to run firefox with a document and output the result to file? (resolving javascript)

03:26  xTheGoat121x: I have a random question about testing Fx 4 on Ubuntu
03:27  xTheGoat121x: I'd like to install from the PPA, but is there one that isn't a daily build? I'd rather not have to run updates every day.
03:35  geeknik: pretty sure the following will just install the beta and not the nightly builds:
03:35  geeknik: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa && sudo apt-get update
03:35  geeknik: sudo apt-get install firefox-4.0
03:36  geeknik: oops, wait that is the daily ppa
03:36 * geeknik chuckles. 
03:36  geeknik: might just try ppa:ubuntu-mozilla/ppa
03:38  xTheGoat121x: geeknik -- thanks, I'll check it out

03:50  nsgn: been searching addons but not finding much that lets you slim/tweak the visual layout
03:53  geeknik: nsgn: for thunderbird, you're probably going to have to hit up #thunderbird over on irc.mozilla.org. =)
03:55  nsgn: *sigh* alright. thx

07:16  yuler: Where can I find a list of command line arguments for Firefox?  The Firefox support page is limited and other web pages are years out of date.
07:17 @gavin: firefox -help
07:18  yuler: well, I'll be.  No more -offline?
07:19 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Command_Line_Options
07:21  yuler: Ironically, the developer website is one of the outdated sites, according to the page time stamp: 2007.
07:21 @gavin: feel free to update it! :)
07:21  yuler: oops, just saw the "modified" timestamp
07:22 @kbrosnan: unless the command line options changed in the last few versions why would it need chagning
07:23 @kbrosnan: addtionally if you log into the wiki it was last edited Dec-15
07:26  yuler: kbrosnan: point taken.  I just want to make sure I'm looking at updated info.  I used to start firefox with -offline, but apparently the argument was removed.
07:26  yuler: Most times, I save tabs upon exit, but I'd like to load the cache data upon restart instead of the 'net.

09:28  leo22: which one is safer?!Firefox or Safari
09:29 @kbrosnan: says the person running opera. whichever one you perfer to run.
09:30  leo22: yeah,Opera is the best all around the world!
09:39 @kbrosnan: protip: if you are trying to troll #firefox change your username from opera
09:51  geeknik: lame. firefox isn't remembering my app tabs any more.
10:00 @kbrosnan: geeknik: have tabs and windows set to be remembered?
10:00  geeknik: yeah. i sorted it. 64bit Minefield wasn't using right profile and I didn't catch it. =)
10:00 @kbrosnan: having history set to never rememeber history will prevent app tabs from being remembered
10:01  geeknik: oh, i have like 9238754 days of history saved. ;)
10:02  geeknik: I think my places.sqlite is a good test case for history sidebar lag issues. ;)

10:20  geeknik: got=gone
10:20  geeknik: 5-6 hours a night for the last 2 weeks.
10:20 @kbrosnan: shovel my driveway. it builds character...or that is what Calvin's Dad seems to believe
10:20  geeknik: hit google a few times too and managed to get in some nice unreported bugs there as well..
10:21  geeknik: i would, but i'm on medical restrictions right now, can't do much except sit on my arse. ;)
11:11  geeknik: kbrosnan: do you have a url for win64 hourly builds? i have the url for 32 bit, but i can't find the other.
11:12  geeknik: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-central-win64/ appears to be empty.
11:13  geeknik: and http://hourly-archive.localgho.st/hourly-archive2/ only has 64 bit OSX builds. =(
11:15  geeknik: of course, it's been 6 days since a nighly x64 build was even made..
11:38  BBBX: when a window.location event is triggered... what triggers script appearing inline after that event to stop being parsed and executed?
11:39  BBBX: im able to trigger multiple window.location events, passign from url, to url2, to url3, triggering an alert at each step. SOMETIMES, but not always
11:40  BBBX: does anyone know how this works, what triggers the script to stop, // or what allows it to continue, past the load of another url?
11:40  BBBX: and if not, could you point me in the direction of a channel here on freenode that may?

12:37  gnu_molester: hi there
12:37  gnu_molester: can i somehow limit firefox's greed ?
12:38  gnu_molester: i don't know why it is doing so but this filthy piece of crap has with opened one window and few tabs there about 500-600MB of RSS after few days of uptime
12:43  geeknik: close it and restart it. ;) i run nightly builds, so at least once a day, my firefox is restarted so memory usage isn't too bad. ;)
12:44  gnu_molester: geeknik: yes, thanks, this is way i'm using but it's pretty annoying and it is still no reasonable resolution for: why the fuck devours firerefox so much memory :P
12:44  geeknik: right now, 8 tabs = 690MB of RAM usage. even still, this box has 24GB of RAM, so I don't even notice it.. ;)
12:44  gnu_molester: geeknik: :P
12:44  gnu_molester: goood
12:46  gnu_molester: geeknik: my box runs actually in esx vmware and has not so much memory .. just about 1GB .. whole operating system + DE (desktop env) has half of firefox's usage
12:47  gnu_molester: geeknik: but no worry in real ... all browsers do so i think ... it's a big sickness of 21st century that mankind still didn't invent a browser software :P
12:47  geeknik: I've had Chrome blow away Firefox's RAM usage by 500MB before, so Firefox is pretty tame in comparison. ;)
12:48  gnu_molester: geeknik: sorry i didn't understood properly to your last sentnce ... did you mean that chrome is better in this ?
12:48  geeknik: no.
12:48  gnu_molester: okay :P
12:49  geeknik: Chrome is worse, at least in my experience.
12:49  gnu_molester: geeknik: i don't use anything from google ... i don't like them
12:49  geeknik: I have all the latest browsers installed for testing purposes.. =)
12:50  gnu_molester: i tested opera - same as firefox - and my belowed konqueror is unfortunatelly slow and doesn't like flash no matter that has proprietary adobe plugin
12:50  gnu_molester: ***beloved
12:50  phenom: When I dl say a torrent file and I select FF to automatically open the file,, it asks for permission every time. I reinstalled FF. Fix?
12:51  gnu_molester: phenom: which perms o.O ??
12:52  geeknik: phenom: tools->options->applications.. look for the TORRENT file content type and check the action that is listed.
12:52  geeknik: might be under tools->options->content->manage depending on your version.
12:53  geeknik: my TORRENT file option says Use qBittorrent (default).
12:53  phenom: It is listed, and it is selected to open with ktorrent. Yet it still asks ever time.
12:54  gnu_molester: phenom: which kind of permissions ?
12:54  geeknik: change it to ask every time. close the browser. reopen the browser and change it back to ktorrent. see what happens.
12:55  phenom: crap: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 2011-01-12 12:47 firefox -> ../lib/firefox-3.6.13/firefox.sh

12:56  phenom: :/
12:56  geeknik: no, probably not. ;)
12:56  phenom: I'm curious if I may have borked up if I'd done a manual update at some point.
12:57  geeknik: you can change it back. what is your username?
12:57  phenom: phenom
12:57  geeknik: just login as root and chown phenom:phenom firefox
12:57  phenom: I'm scared its library files may have been changed as well

12:59  phenom: But I don't remember ever manually updating it.

13:01  BBBX: either of you know anything about manipulating javascript after a window.location is set?
13:03  BBBX: the script execution doesnt seem to stop automatically after the window.location is set, and im trying to determine what condtion exists that allows the code to continue past that point, and then what condition causes it to stop before reaching the actual endpoint of the script.
13:14  phenom: geeknik, Mind checking if your firefox bin is owned by root? :P
13:15  geeknik: let me fire up the VM and look

13:21  phenom: eh, I hate to say it. I'm tired of linux in its entirety
13:22  phenom: I started using Ubuntu because I was tired of setting up/configuring wireless/x/sound/blah when every I set up a debian box
13:23  phenom: But ubuntu has a lot of problems I am continually getting tired of dealing with.
13:23  phenom: Not including this. I fear this is some oddball FF issue
13:24  gnu_molester: phenom: buntu is terrifically bustled distro :P
13:24  geeknik: i just find it laughable that it runs better in a VM.

13:26  phenom: I was thinking about getting a macbook, and installing win7/nix triple boot.
13:26  phenom: More for shits and giggles but blah
13:27  geeknik: i have an osx vm that i've never booted up.
13:30  phenom: I'm going to install an OSX VM inside a win 7 VM inside an ubuntu host. Boom Turducken.

13:52  gnu_molester: phenom: i hate firefox :P and whole mankind that still didn't invented a real browser software in 21st century
13:54  BBBX: thats been an issue in the past, but i think they are moving away from that in recent years
13:55  phenom: BBBX, They haven't given a fucking thing back to the open source community.
13:55  phenom: Can't even sync an ipod without losing hair
13:55  BBBX: lol they build a machine that works, and works well. they are running a business not a charity
13:56  BBBX: cant sync an ipod? -.-
13:56  phenom: BBBX, To a linux machine
13:56  BBBX: my grandmother can sync her ipod and she can hardly use the vcr
13:56  phenom: sorry
13:56  gnu_molester: phenom: wondering that you even have some :P (hair + ipod don't fit together)
13:58  phenom: Well, I am not blaming them for any thing. Just stating why I don't like them. If I were Jobs, I'd expect all Apple consumers for accept nothing more than what I give them and be happy with it heh
13:59  phenom: You're never rich in this world,, I don't blame Jobs and the Apple mafia for wanting to turn a buck.
13:59  phenom: Just make a fucking driver to sync my damn touch to my linux boxes already.
13:59  gnu_molester: If i were Jobs i'd listen to street-punk and more oi-HC to get some better ideas
14:00  BBBX: nah, like i said its a business, and when it comes down to it, its all about the quality of product they are putting out there for the consumer, and in my opinion apple machines are superior to that of most pc setups for pretty much ANY purpose.
14:00  phenom: Seems I curse a lot discussing Apple Lol
14:01  BBBX: most people who hate on apple. have not owned one recently
14:01  BBBX: apple used to be garbage, i hated them, they were stupid to navigate, slow as hell, and just clunky imo
14:01  phenom: I've only owned ipods and the like
14:01  BBBX: but anymore, they are quite the opposite
14:02  BBBX: i dont touch a pc anymore if i can help it lol
14:02  phenom: I understand their perceived quality, and I know why it is so.
14:02  BBBX: and the only time i do, is to fix the damn things for friends and family
14:02  phenom: Their strict software and hardware limitations.
14:02  BBBX: because they never work like they should
14:02  BBBX: strict softtware hardware limitations?
14:03  BBBX: i can run any software on a mac that you can on a pc, if not directly thru os x then thru a vmware etc. and they run just fine.
14:03  phenom: I had a supervisor try to school me saying OSX is the most backward compatible operating system. A) Doesn't make sense. B) OSX only works on mac hardware.
14:03  BBBX: and shit anymore, the macs are available intel based. its not strict hardwarge configs anymore
14:04  phenom: a million mac owners own the same exact device.
14:04  phenom: My underpowered HTC Aria puts the iphone to shame :P
14:05  BBBX: iphone shmyphone, who cares about phones, they are just a poor mans computer
14:05  BBBX: phones are toys in my opinion
14:05  BBBX: you cant judge apple as a whole based upon thier phones lol
14:05  phenom: Yea
14:05  BBBX: thats only a small portion of thier product line
14:05  phenom: Sure you can
14:06  BBBX: lol thats being very closed minded
14:06  phenom: It's completely relevant to apples philosophy. I still here iphone mooks ask me if I've seen the iphone 4 before and "What it can do" Lol
14:06  phenom: They are all the fucking same lol
14:07  phenom: Hey, I'm not complaining, ranting more so.
14:07  phenom: I understand why and how they've built a following.
14:09  phenom: Jobs got so pissed when google stepped in to the phone market. and called google out specifically saying "google stepped in to the phone business, we didn't step in to the search business" Lol
14:09  phenom: Like Apple should own any technology it develops
14:10  BBBX: meh, i have no opinon about thier social misgivings, and honestly dont care lol
14:10  phenom: I hear you.
14:10  BBBX: i care about a product that works like its sposed to, when its sposed to
14:11  phenom: As long as it works*. That is the philosophy that brought me to ubuntu that is continually letting me down. I may be an apple fanboy not by choice, but from a lack of one heh
14:11  BBBX: my roomate is a big time microsoft guru, she works for the retail store and is a developer, and she hates on mac more than anyone ive ever met and she's never even used one
14:12  BBBX: she comes in to chill and talk and starts making comments like, oh well i dont know how THATS going to work on your mac, or let see how your MAC can do this, or that... like its some kind of alien technology that no one understands
14:12  phenom: I've used them a bit. I understand they work well. I won't judge the quality of them.
14:13  phenom: Like I said, I'm on a philosophical trip.
14:13  BBBX: haha yeah i hear yah
14:15  BBBX: they really are great machines tho from my experience. osx is a little odd to get the hang of coming from a diff OS, but its quite easy to learn and its actually alot cleaner and stable than other os's ive dealt with in the past
14:15  phenom: I have Irish blood in me heh. Like my folks, I'm principled and can hold a grudge. :)
14:15  phenom: yea
14:17  BBBX: and what i REALLY like, is the software packs, (which are mostly free, for ANYTHING you want) dont tack on garbage like the majority of pc software does. you install what you want, not what they think you might want as well(because they are being paid to promote it)
14:17  phenom: yea f itunes btw :P
14:17  BBBX: lol eh, itunes is alright, there are other options tho
14:17  phenom: like drag and drop
14:18  BBBX: you dont have to use macs base software for anything
14:18  BBBX: itunes has gotten a bit better , but i still dont care for it personally either
14:18  BBBX: but who cares, when you dont like 1 piece of software, this day and age there are usually always alternatives xD
14:19  phenom: I hate how people tell me itunes is so easy to use. drag in to library/create playlist/sync, sync with another machine wipe everything garbage. Nothing easier than drag and drop heh
14:20  phenom: I have a touch/zune and my music on my android phone is much easier to manage than both of them.
14:20  phenom: Just drag and drop files on to it.
14:21  phenom: It will be interesting to see what apple does on the next ipad
14:21  phenom: I think gingerbread is going to put it to shame.
14:21  phenom: android*
14:21  BBBX: eh ipad are popular as hell, but again, to me. its a toy
14:21  phenom: Yea, they are cool
14:21  BBBX: novelty, its the damn iphone os
14:22  phenom: I have a modded viewsonic g tablet, it's a beast. I use it for traveling etc.
14:22  phenom: use it while* traveling I should say.
14:22  BBBX: haha thats cool
14:22  BBBX: i'd opt for a lil 13 incher macbook tho myself xD
14:23  phenom: I'm not a good flier. I need to be occupied at all times. I need my music and family guy heh
14:23  BBBX: yeah xD i have a flight this friday, downloading a couple movies to watch on the way right now :D
14:23  phenom: That macbook air looks nice
14:24  BBBX: id stear clear of the aluminum case ones for the time being
14:24  phenom: I may buy it. ah yea?
14:24  BBBX: they have horrible wifi from what ive heard
14:24  phenom: oh
14:24  BBBX: the case interferes with it
14:24  phenom: No kidding lol
14:24 * phenom rolls eyes
14:25  BBBX: lol yeah, i read about that recently alot of users were complaining about poor signal and it was determined it was being caused by interference from the metal case lol
14:25  BBBX: they are slick lookin little machines tho
14:26  BBBX: id opt for a year or two old macbook or macbook pro tho if your lookin for a good deal
14:26  phenom: Yea, linux/win run better on mac hardware, than mac/x runs on x hardware.
14:26  BBBX: the prices have come way down and they are beasty little boxes for the money
14:26  BBBX: osx is unix based
14:26  phenom: I need win and linux though.

14:27  phenom: I'd dual boot it.
14:27  phenom: Or triple boot it
14:27  BBBX: thats the way to go really
14:28  BBBX: id do it, but i honestly cant stand using windows anymore
14:28  BBBX: i have no need or want to even boot it
14:28  phenom: win7 has been great to me so far.
14:28  phenom: No problems other than it forcing shutdows after some updates
14:28  phenom: I hate that.
14:28  BBBX: windows is windows is windows. its unstable bulky, and just plain frustrating at most times
14:29  BBBX: i rarely reboot my mac, usually only when prompted to do so by software updates
14:30  BBBX: it doesnt get all boggy and stupid after being run for extended peroids of time
14:30  BBBX: i always hated that about my pc's
14:30  phenom: MS has always had poor memory management.
14:30  BBBX: you run em for so long and shit just gets soo slowwwwww, then you reboot, and things are back to normal
14:30  BBBX: but again after not so long, its bogs down and down and down
14:30  phenom: Although, I can't run a win box long enough to see how long it stay up so to speak.
14:31  BBBX: ive not noticed that at all with macs
14:31  phenom: I only run win7 on my laptop
14:31  phenom: But my linux boxes will stay up indefinitely.
14:31  phenom: When you cross a year mark, that equals indefinitely. :)
14:32  BBBX: haha yeah
14:33  phenom: There was a memory leak in power-manager, an app I had running on my desktop that was actually not even needed on that system. I got home after it running 7 months,, and it was crawling.. It took me 5 minutes or so to even pull up system monitor app to see wtf,, I killed it,, and let it's still running no prob
14:33  phenom: ;)
14:34  phenom: linux is great for some things.
14:34  phenom: Luckily it fits the bill for what I need it for. servers*
14:34  BBBX: mhmm i agree, it serves its purposes
14:35  BBBX: but for an all around machine, its really not my cup of tea
14:35  BBBX: maneuvering around can be a bit of a task at times
14:36  phenom: I hear you,, I used to be a linux zealot.
14:37  phenom: It would take me 3 hours to set up wireless and sound,, but I'd argue how great it was any day :P
14:37  BBBX: yeah, configuring shit can be quite a pain
14:37  phenom: Ah well, linux is sort of similar between most distros.
14:37  phenom: Depends on the UI more than any thing. Gnome is Gnome etc
14:38  phenom: I hope this "Android thing" helps the open source community out, because Apple/Win are not for sure.
14:39  BBBX: eh and they never will, the open source community is enemy to both
14:39  BBBX: thats thier competitor in a lot of senses
14:39  phenom: But what both of them were built from.
14:39  BBBX: they arent gonna share shit if they dont have to, and it makes sense business wise for them to behave in that manner
14:39  phenom: OSX still rely's on CUPS from my understanding for printing.
14:40  BBBX: sure they may themselves rely on some open source technology to do what they need to do, but that doesnt mean they have to 'give back' lol
14:41  phenom: :)
14:42  BBBX: this isnt a communist society where everyone has to do thier part xD its the real world, fend for yourself if you dont wanna get left behind
14:44  BBBX: aaaaanyways
14:45  phenom: OSX would be better if they licensed it out. Which will be the next step I fear pending the Android revolution Lol
14:45  BBBX: ive been so bored im coding a mod applet for a facebook game lol
14:45  phenom: Android FTW! ;)
14:46  BBBX: ive never even used an android phone
14:46  BBBX: i use my cell phone as an alarm clock and flashlight lol
14:47  phenom: android phones are nice.
14:47  phenom: If you like the iphone,, and aren't a die hard fanboi lol,, you'd like it.
14:47  phenom: If you like the smartphone thing.
14:47  BBBX: the iphones are alright, im just really not much of a phone kinda guy
14:48  phenom: I've succumbed to the fact,, I now require music and internet on a phone heh.
14:48 --- kateweb_ is now known as kateweb
14:48  BBBX: i hate talking on the damn things, i cant stand texting, and browsing the web, if you can even call it that, is a waste of time on a phone when i have a computer with me 90% of the time lol
14:49  phenom: I've succumbed to the fact,, I now require music, internet and wifi tethering* on a phone heh.
14:49  phenom: yea
14:49  BBBX: its like using your watch caluculator to do calculus when you have a scientific calculator sitting right there.
14:49  phenom: luckily im grandfathered in to at&t''s unlimited data plan
14:49  phenom: Good analogy
14:50  BBBX: lol well thats really how it feels to me
14:50  phenom: I can use my phones wifi etc for all my wireless devices. It's,, pretty crafty.
14:50  BBBX: ive never understood peoples fascinatin with wifi enable phones
14:50  BBBX: ive never used a broswer on a phone that didnt make me wanna throw the damn thing against the wall and be done with it
14:50  BBBX: yeah now thats handy
14:51  BBBX: using it as a wifi router/repeater
14:51  phenom: Yea
14:51  BBBX: thats the only reason i ever thought about getting an iphone
14:51  phenom: Best thing about it really
14:51  phenom: Nah, don't get an iphone for that
14:51  BBBX: eh this was a few years back
14:51  phenom: Get a rootable Android and slap cm6 or 7 on it
14:51  BBBX: when they were new technology
14:51  BBBX: and the other phones couldnt do that
14:52  phenom: I may have persuaded the cyanogen mods in to releasing cm7 today :P
14:52  BBBX: well ive since learned to crack wifi access pretty much anywhere i go, so i dont need to rely on that
14:52  BBBX: lol
14:53  phenom: BBBX, win smartphones did that way before iphone were out :P
14:53 * phenom rolls eyes ;)
14:53  BBBX: ahh, well thats news to me
14:53  BBBX: id never heard about em
14:53  BBBX: like i said, im not a phone guy
14:53  phenom: apple improved a lot of the technology ms neglected in win mobile 5 etc
14:53  BBBX: the iphones were the first i was aware of that allowed you to do such things
14:54  BBBX: without being modded that is
14:54  phenom: Yea, I have a couple old win smartphones. pain in the ass to use really.
14:56  phenom: I tell you what though. I am looking forward to this tablet war.
14:56  phenom: We're going to see a lot af great devices come about here soon.
14:57  BBBX:  eh you and alot of other people, it really doesnt interest me in the least tho
14:57  BBBX: im not much of a gadget guy xD
14:57  BBBX: unless its accessories for my laptop
14:57  BBBX: lol
14:57  phenom: right
14:58  phenom: I fear I have become a gadget guy. I fear I've found justification for every device I own.
14:58  BBBX: haha, i used to be like that, til one day i decided i hated having so much shit
14:58  phenom: true that. I have a pile of outdated junk
14:58  phenom: But this g tablet,, android phone and my laptop is all I have.
14:58  BBBX: i gave away/sold/threw away everything i couldnt fit in my backpack  and travel bag and started traveling
14:59  phenom: I consider them all essential now heh
14:59  phenom: I have 3 other laptops I need to get rid of.
14:59  BBBX: ever since then i dont even care to own things
14:59  BBBX: i have my guitar, i have my computer, i dont really NEED anything else lol
14:59  phenom: I buy shit from friends whenever they buy something else because they're too dumb to take my advice and reinstall the system etc.
15:00  phenom: It's slow, I  must buy a new pc syndrome. :P
15:00  BBBX: haha, yeah tis a good way to score toys ^^
15:00  phenom: Ahh true,, I have my guitars too.
15:01  BBBX: i got rid of 3 of em

15:01  BBBX: had to have something to jam on while traveling
15:01  phenom: I just bought a Takamine a few months back.
15:02  phenom: Love it.
15:02  BBBX: ive lugged that poor guitar from coast to coast a few times
15:02  BBBX: mmm yeah takamine makes a great acoustic
15:02  BBBX: i had a takamine 12 sting that i absolutely loved
15:02  phenom: Hah,, yea.. I've taken it to 3 continents. And it's survived so far.
15:02  phenom: Well, it's been on 3 continents
15:02  BBBX: my current is my ibanez exotic woods series acoustic
15:02  BBBX: its so gorgeous
15:03  BBBX: spalted maple

15:04  BBBX: haha im the same way, i used to love electric, until i got my first nice acoustic
15:04  BBBX: andi nevr really went back
15:04  phenom: yea, I have one because I was a mook when I was younger,, it's a horrible guitar to play.
15:05  BBBX: you cant play it sitting down
15:05  BBBX: which for me, means i cant play it
15:05  BBBX: lol
15:05  phenom: right, me too heh
15:05  BBBX: i suck playing standing up, ive never felt comfortable standing while playing
15:05  phenom: That's why I didn't get a backpacker acoustic

15:09  BBBX: they never last that long
15:10  BBBX: i spend alot of time at the beach playing
15:10  BBBX: the strings dont seem to like it too much
15:10  phenom: I haven't popped a strings in years.

15:30  Symanb0rk: hello, i am trying to diagnose random processor spikes in firefox, can you give me some tips on how to go about this?
15:33  Symanb0rk: i will give you a bit of background, i leave firefox.exe open for hours at a time and notice within a few hours the cpu will start to spike to 100% at random intervals
15:34  Symanb0rk: i have reinstalled 3.6.13 now with a fresh profile and no extensions hoping to get to the bottom of this
15:59  Symanb0rk: so can anyone recommend a tool to diagnose the spikes when they start happening again?
16:18  Symanb0rk: ive disabled session restore through about:config
16:27  Symanb0rk: that didnt work, still seeing spikes to 30% at the moment
