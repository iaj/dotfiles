00:01 @kbrosnan: as far as i know it is not settable without messing with the source or maybe an extension can override the behavior. though i only use gnome for my desktop. might be worthwhile to check with someone who maintains the Firefox package for a non-gnome based distro
00:02  Thell: there was a guy who edited toolkit.jar and made a lil app to act as the handler.  I was just hoping against google that I had missed someone 'solving' this issue already.
00:02  Thell: No biggie, but it does seem a deficientcy that a handler can't be defined.
00:02 * Thell shrugs
00:06  satdav: kbrosnan: can I pm you on here if possible
00:07 @kbrosnan: satdav: if it is quick or i'll get to it when i get back in a couple hours
00:11  pcard: # ok, I /REALLY/ don't want to sound like I'm knocking progress and/or Firefox in any way, but I'm testing out Firefox 4 Beta 8, and while it seems nice, there are some things that may keep me on 3.6 for my main browser.
00:11  pcard: # irst,  I just want ot know why the hell the Statusbar was removed?
00:12  satdav: mconnor: ping
00:12  pcard: First, I just want ot know why the sam hell the Statusbar was removed? Seems like such a needless/pointless change. Also, seems odd having the address bar actually be part of the tab now instead of above it.
00:13  pcard: I also noticed some addons don't work, like QuickJava, which I had the quick-access icon in the right-hand side of the statusbar (same with AdBlock+, at least it still works though.)
00:15 @kbrosnan: binary extensions such as java quickstart will need to be updated by their creator
00:17  pcard: Please don't get me wrong, I love Firefox. I used to use Maxthon (an IE wrapper), made the switch to Firefox some time ago and never looked back since. I am using 3.6.13 now and am really happy. I have all the ad-ons that make it a wonderful experience, and I am thankful all around for that.
00:17  pcard: binary?
00:18 @kbrosnan: there were a few reasons for the removal of status bar, 1) place the url you are going to in the same area as where it will be when you click 2) reduce the vertcal hight 3) reduce ui complexity from redunant indicators
00:18 @kbrosnan: might be missing a few
00:18  pcard: I thought extensions were written in JavaScript; most of the time I can get a Add-on working in 3.6 that only goes up to 3.0 or 3,5 by jsut changing it's max version number
00:19  pcard: kbrosnan: those are fine reasons, to be sure, but redundancy is not always bad.
00:19  rjohnson19: pcard: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/235283/ to get link display in the add-on bar; ABP should display there if you set it to in its options
00:20 @kbrosnan: most of the time is the key word there. i would be supprised if the java extension is written in javascript
00:20  geeknik: just use the add-on compatibility extension. better than editing the max version and you can report incompatibility.. =)
00:20  geeknik: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/15003/
00:21  geeknik: it also enables incompatible extensions so you can use them, as much as possible. ;)
00:26  pcard: rjohnson19: thanks
00:26  rjohnson19: np
00:26  pcard: kbrosnan: um, QuickJava is not a "java extension", it's an extension that toggles on and off what is to be downloaded when a page is fetched (java, javascript, flash, silverlight, css, images)
00:27  pcard: While I love firefox, especially 3.6, having tested 4 Beta 8 now, I feel is, with Firefox 4, though it's still in beta, seems to be starting to suffer from over-progressive-ness, where it's trying to make too much of a jump ahead, making changes that don't really need to be made. Just because you can change something that mean one should or that it's a good idea. Some things that have been part of browsers for the better part of 15 years now have rema
00:32  pcard: IMHO, there is no good reason that I've seen to nix the statusbar other than change-for-the-sake-of-change. I really tend to be weary of this sort of attitude, as it's what gave us the complete and utter rubbish that is Windows Vista (and in many ways, translated into Windows 7, which shares the same stiff and inflexible Windows Explorer), and also the Ribbon in Office 2007+ and Windows 7 apps like Paint. Maybe some people like such changes, but not e
00:35  domsz: hi there!
00:36  domsz: question about the game on contest: am i allowed to submit a game made with a commercial game engine?
00:36  domsz: i.e. http://impactjs.com/
00:44  geeknik: domsz: https://gaming.mozillalabs.com/rules says you can use libraries.. but it has to be open source, and if the commercial game engine isn't open source, there might be an issue..
00:44  domsz: ok
00:44  domsz: but the rules also say, that i dont have to publish the source of my game
00:44  domsz: and this particular library is my own :)
00:45  geeknik: Libraries and modules that are public and freely available are allowed and encouraged. . Stock photos and free icon sets are allowed. Paying for something that is not generally available to everyone is not.
00:45  domsz: so it basically is the "source of my game"
00:46  domsz: i don't want to be a smart ass about it, i just hoped to get my question answered
00:46  domsz: in either way
00:46  geeknik: i'd just submit it and see what happens. ;)
00:46  domsz: well, ok. i already did that :)

00:49  domsz: too easy?

00:50  geeknik: it's an original idea though, i like it.

05:35  delt: like on youtube videos, the button for grow/shrink window, etc etc... (volume works, weird)
05:36  delt: also non-swf-related, the comment box.... greyed out "respond to this video" stays in the box when i click on it, and the cursor acts like there's about 12 spaces on the next line
05:36  delt: 10 sorry just counted (cursor stays greyed out too)
05:37  delt: anyway, i have all my passwords & stuff in my ~/.mozilla/firefox and i DONT want to lose all of it (.sqlite files i believe?)

05:38  delt: with seamonkey (or firefox from another user acct) works fine, but i want mine back :( :(

18:56  jeev: no but seriously, what do you do to stop these stupid memory leaks
18:56  jeev: the faq doesn't really help
18:57  jeev: If you find that Firefox's memory usage continues to grow after long periods of being open, you may want to consider periodically restarting Firefox to bring the memory usage back to reasonable levels. Close Firefox and select the Save and Quit option to reopen your tabs when Firefox restarts.
18:57  jeev: is that seriously the best solution ?
18:58  xangua: try the beta jeev ;)
18:58  jeev: i'm told...
