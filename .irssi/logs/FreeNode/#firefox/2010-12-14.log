13:45  physically_fit: so... my firefox 40b8pre is crashing like crazy after i did an update this morning. crashes with every add-on. running in it in safe mode to delete those addons is not helping because it crashes too. i can't browse any internet web page anymore.
13:45  poppiez_: hi guys. does firefox handle image poly areas with a lot of shapes? I have a polygon with 40 shapes that firefox just can't handle. all other browsers can (except opera). see testcase: http://jsfiddle.net/D4Pfm/

14:48  nexx: auscompgeek: thanks, but wireshark doesnt help in this case. i can record all traffic, yes, but i cannot assign to a specific website. i see upload-traffic to an ip every day, and when i close firefox the traffic also stops, so it got to be a opened website... got many tabs open all the time, but closing one after another doesnt make me see where the traffic goes to

17:59  dev001: I'm using BetterPrivacy addon to clean 'super cookies' etc.  I'm completely unclear as to which LSO contains global Flash settings (disk usage, microphone/capmera access, etc).  Atm, it seems as-installed default settings for BP are (auto)deleting it -- as those setting aren't sticking for me across FF reboots.
17:59  dev001:  Any hints as to what to "keep"?  I'm digging thru lots of discussions -- just haven't found a definintive answer yet :-/
17:59  satdav: dev001, if this is a addon we cant help you with addons on here

18:10  dev001: satdav Ok.  So where *are* addons discuss-able, if not in "Mozilla Firefox community support on Freenode"?

18:16  dev001: Guess that means not in THIS community.  thx! movin' ...

23:32  freshmeat: Hey.
23:32  freshmeat: Guys, does Firefox have filtering capabilities/
23:32 @kbrosnan: filtering what?
23:33  freshmeat: I have children here.
23:34 @kbrosnan: not by default
23:34 @kbrosnan: browser utilities are easy to circumvent
23:35  freshmeat: What is the best thing that I could do?
23:39 @kbrosnan: not realy sure.
23:40 @kbrosnan: there is software that will filter at a network level what people are viewing in the household
23:40 @kbrosnan: or track depending on the settings.
23:41 @kbrosnan: don't really have any specific names of software though
23:55  arnotixe: hi all on ubuntu 10.10 firefox wants to save the pdfs I click on. But I want to open them with evince. Can't find any pdf options in Preferences, either, and the only two options I get when clicking a pdf is "Cancel" or "Save". Suggestions?
23:57  arnotixe: the issue is not site-dependent, because from other machines with firefox I can open the files directly..
