19:25  willoo: Hey there.
19:26  willoo: Does anyone else have trouble opening .pdf docs with Firefox, using FoxIt?   My FF crashes for a bit, a "Retry... Switch to..." error pops up, if I click "Switch to", bam it works.
19:27  willoo: It's annoying as sometimes it hangs so bad I have to ctrl+alt+del and reload it. However, it works fine in Chrome.
19:29  willoo: I just switched to the main program insteal of the foxit plugin, works like a charm now, as it dl's and opens instead of opens in the browser.  See you guys!
21:46  hstefan: how can I make openjdk java plugin work with firefox?
21:49 @kbrosnan: depends on the version of firefox and the version of openjdk
21:52  hstefan: firefox ver 3.6.13, openjdk6-6.b20_1.9.3-1
21:53  xangua: installing restricted extras installs the openjdk plugin

21:54  hstefan: xangua: what do you mean? btw, I'm running arch here, if its useful to know.
21:54  xangua: ooh i tought i was in #ubuntu :P
21:55  xangua: i use the icedtea6-plugin for it
21:55  xangua: search for it, or maybe openjdk-plugin ¿¿
21:56  hstefan: extra/openjdk6 6.b20_1.9.3-1 [installed] Free Java environment based on OpenJDK 6.0 with IcedTea6 replacing binary plugs.
21:56  hstefan: looks like it's already installed
21:57 @kbrosnan: firefox 3.6 requires a java v2 plugin, last i knew sun had not open souced it
21:58  hstefan: oh... I'll use the proprietary version then
21:58 @kbrosnan: best to check with the openjdk people as they will know more about their product
21:58  hstefan: where can I find them?
21:58  hstefan: they*
21:59  xangua: hstefan: yes we see you have openjdk installed, but did you install the PLUGIN ¿
21:59  hstefan: xangua: I have no idea about the package name
22:00  xangua: icedtea6-plugin in ubuntu
22:00  hstefan: xangua: yes, but as my paste told, icedtea is already installed
22:00  xangua: icedtea6-PLUGIN
22:01  xangua: have you searched for something like that

23:24  RobotCow: how come my firefox can not play mkv's directly in the browser?
23:29  geeknik: RobotCow: Pretty sure you need a plugin for that, probably something like VLC.
23:29  geeknik: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14730/
23:29  RobotCow: geeknik, i have mozilla-totem plugin and totem will play the videos just fine
23:29 @kbrosnan: because firefox only supports webm and ogg as pluginless video
23:30  RobotCow: it will let me play video files with other extensions, and I can see even more in about:mozilla. Is there someway i could tell firefox to handle .mkv videos with totem-gstreamer in about:plugins
23:30  RobotCow: maybe a way to do in about:config
23:30 @kbrosnan: plugins are seperate from firefox
23:31  RobotCow: its firefox thats not using the available plugin
23:31  RobotCow:  /\.(?:mpeg|ra?m|avi|mp(?:g|e|4)|mov|divx|asf|qt|wmv|m\dv|rv|vob|asx|ogm)$/i
23:31  RobotCow: i think i need to add mkv in there
23:32  RobotCow: for extensions.dta.filters.deffilter-vid.test
23:32  RobotCow: wait, no
23:32  RobotCow: dta is downloadthemall extension
23:32  RobotCow: ugh
23:32 @kbrosnan: that list is supplyed by the plugin
23:34  RobotCow: i hope its in a text file i can edit
23:34 @kbrosnan: no
23:36  geeknik: i'd have a look around http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ and see what you can find.
