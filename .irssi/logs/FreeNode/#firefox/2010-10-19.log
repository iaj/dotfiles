08:59  electronicmaji2: haelp
08:59  electronicmaji2: is there a addon that lets me transfer browser sessions from one computer to another
10:11  Bjornet: Hi, I have a 'red dotted border 1px' showing up every time I click on a link. When I develope - is it posible to hide it?
10:12  Cork: Bjornet: through css or permanently in the client?
10:12  Bjornet: permanently in the client
10:12  Bjornet: only FF not Safari, IE
10:13  Bjornet: The link Im refering to is one out of several where this happens
10:13  Bjornet: This one is linked via jQuery
10:14  Cork: i think there is
10:14  Bjornet: so when I click a IMG that red border is added on the perimiters of the IMG
10:14  Cork: let me see if i can remember the name
10:15  Cork: Bjornet: set browser.display.focus_ring_width to 0
10:15  Cork: (int about:config)
10:16  Bjornet: but this is on my computer?
10:16  Bjornet: in my firefox client?
10:16  Cork: ya
10:16  Bjornet: ok what I want is it to be a global thing
10:17  Bjornet: in all ff clients
10:17  Cork: Bjornet: you said it was permanently on the client....
10:17  Cork: Bjornet: in css then
10:17  Bjornet: Ah I meant:
10:17  Bjornet: FF as a client
10:17  Bjornet: ok, might this work in the CSS
10:17  Bjornet: -moz-focus-inner { border: 0; }
10:17  Bjornet: Ill try it.. just found it.
10:17  Cork: or a more generic way
10:17  Cork: a:hover { outline: none !importent; }
10:18  Cork: will remove it in all clients
10:18  Bjornet: Ah cool
10:18  Bjornet: tnx
10:18  Cork: np
10:18  Cork: ops important not tent :x
10:18  Bjornet: ^^
10:25  Bjornet: Cork: if I make the css selector ":hover" and forsake the "a", FF will understand that I mean "do something with all elems that has psuedo :hover"
10:25  Bjornet: Is that true for IE, chrome, safari as well
10:27  auscompgeek: Yes.
10:29  auscompgeek: if you mean something like this: *:hover { color: white; }
10:41  Bjornet: auscompgeek: I just write         :hover, :visited, :link { color: white; }       no star no nothing. But I mean what u illustrate. I expect that ALL elems are affected
10:41  auscompgeek: Hm, that might work... I'm not sure though
10:41  auscompgeek: Bjornet: #css might help there
10:41  Bjornet: ah nice, tnx
10:42  RobertV: what's the feature called where you can apply design patterns to the toolbars?
10:42  auscompgeek: RobertV: You mean Personas?
10:42  RobertV: ah, yes, i think that's it
10:42  auscompgeek: ;)
10:43  auscompgeek: RobertV: otherwise known as "lightweight themes" :P
10:43  RobertV: i was thinking it was themes or plugins
10:43  RobertV: (just reinstalled my OS)
10:43  RobertV: now i'm rockin a new japanese tatoo thanks to you

13:24  nettezzaumana: uff
13:24  nettezzaumana: hi there
13:25  nettezzaumana: just to be honest: i hate firefox so much that .. aaarrrgghh. can i do something for that that firefox won't consume 500MB of ram just for show window with several tabs?
14:21  amcsi: there's an interesting bug that's happened to me for the second time: my firefox went crazy and displays the css wrong, even for itself (using a different computer's firefox browser, the css is fine). The way I fixed this was to make a new profile in firefox and use that. What causes this problem and how can I fix it without making another new profile?
14:26  amcsi: and actually, for one url only, so if I visit the same localhost site, but on my external ip address, the css is fine again
14:28  amcsi: nvm, I fixed it somehow by clearing every cache

14:38  Firefox: Apparently WOT is not that good?
14:55  anon33_: I'm on Ubuntu 32-bit and for some reason, Beta 5/6 is the only version of firefox that doesn't read my profile correctly (well, at all)
14:55  anon33_: Even starting it up with the ProfileManager doesn't do the trick (it ignores any addons installed in my profile), yet the nightlies / version 3.6.x works fine.

19:22  kosiini: actually, I'll just put something in the tracker... maybe
19:24 @kbrosnan: kosiini: please don't
19:24 @kbrosnan: explain what you want better
19:24 @kbrosnan: because chances are with nearly 2/3 of a million bugs filed your requst already exists
19:26  kosiini: if I don't want to bother closing the download window manually, and I've set it to close automatically after finishing downloads
19:26  kosiini: I choose to save a file somewhere, but just to have a look at it later too
19:27  kosiini: so I have to open the download window to open the file and close it again
19:28  kosiini: which could be replaced with a simple checkbox in the download "start dialog"
19:29 @kbrosnan: if the file you are talking about is sent with a binary mime type then Firefox won't give you an option to open it for security reasons
