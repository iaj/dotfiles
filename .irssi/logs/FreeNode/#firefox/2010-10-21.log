02:05  DGodNT: http://sc-s.com/ , the dropdown on FF4 is slow
02:05  DGodNT: Why ?
02:05  DGodNT: Why is FF4 so slow for me ?
02:10  DGodNT: is there a way to disable GPU accel?
02:11  Pendragon: is this the right room to talk about firefox addons?
02:11  Pendragon: I need to request a very simple firefox addon, that I am even willing to pay for
02:12  Pendragon: I want a button that will flip flop arguments between sites
02:12  rjohnson19: DGodNT: dropdown seems fine to me, at least the same as 3.6
02:13  Pendragon: so if my current URL is http://www.SITE_A.com/?arg1=a&arg2=b#selected_tabB  by pressing the button I want the URL to redirect to http://www.SITE_B.com/?arg1=a&arg2=b#selected_tabB  and vice versa
02:14  Pendragon: the reason why I would like this feature is because my live url is a 2 part domain, foo.bar but my dev environment utilizes sub-subdomains.   foo.bar.baz.boggle.com
02:14  Pendragon: so it is a pain in the but to quickly highlight and replace, plus one is http and the other is https
02:14  DGodNT: rjohnson19 i used alpha builds that where much faster

02:22  DGodNT: im so upset firefox's performance just keeps getting worse and worse with every new build , where as the feature set just keeps getting better and better
02:23 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 96 seconds
02:23  DGodNT: 3.6.11 is not to bad, but minefield is like trying to surf with a dead elephant on your back
02:23  DGodNT: The alpha builds where so much zippier
02:24  DGodNT: I remember reading the lifehacker post about the first major alpha/beta release, that release was faster than what i have now
02:27  DGodNT: but that particular build is gone http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tryserver-builds/edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-15284adb0a68/
02:27  DGodNT: :(
02:28  rjohnson19: ? you were using some random try server build?
02:28  DGodNT: I think so
02:28  DGodNT: and question: whats this http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/tryserver-builds/edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-90ccf19ab1f7/tryserver-win32/ ?
02:29  Pendragon: found one , URIMOD
02:29  DGodNT: cool
02:29  rjohnson19: you aren't making a lot of sense, beta 5, minefield, random try server build, first alpha, first beta. if there is a performance regression you would want to find the smallest window where it did/did not appear.
02:31  DGodNT: these are the only 2 ive used
02:31  DGodNT: there is no window
02:32  rjohnson19: you've lost me, sorry
02:33  DGodNT: rjohnsn.. these are the only 2 builds ive used, this one from the ftp above and beta 5
02:33  DGodNT: beta 6 is even slower it seems
02:33  DGodNT: Its odd, because they both have panorama and sync trunks
02:37  DGodNT: rjohnson19 what is this file for  , this win32 tgz ?, i dont think i can build this myself
02:37  rjohnson19: DGodNT: do you know what a try server build is? where are you finding these urls?
02:38  DGodNT: no
02:38  DGodNT: rjohnson19 no i don't
02:38  rjohnson19: and my second question?
02:38  DGodNT: just scaling up from the url i used first
02:39  DGodNT: edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-90ccf19ab1f7 , is the only build with this eronous name
02:39  DGodNT: rjohnson19 why do you ask ?
02:40  rjohnson19: DGodNT: try is for developers to push changes to get tests run, without necessarily being something complete / that would ever be committed to firefox's source.
02:40  DGodNT: Erroneous*
02:40  DGodNT: oh , so its like a bot server
02:40  rjohnson19: I still don't know how you found this original try server url in the first place, so very confused.
02:41  DGodNT: its like a bot server ?
02:41  rjohnson19: I also can't agree that firefox is getting slower with subsequent betas.
02:42  DGodNT: I have 3 laptops and 2 desktops all are "trying" to use firefox 4 , they are all having a tough time with it
02:42  DGodNT: Seems like the browser is getting bloated more and more with age
02:43  DGodNT: When was its last code review ?
02:43  DGodNT: I'm really not concerned as i know its a beta
02:45  DGodNT: Then again it would be nice if it was faster than ff3 as it should be.
02:46  DGodNT: Is this using some kind of completely new gecko core ?
02:46  DGodNT: No answer huh ?
02:46  DGodNT: Thats ashame.
02:57  DGodNT: I'll ask on mozilla 's IRC channel maybe there i will get a more knowledgable group of people.
02:58  xangua: ok ;)
04:11  Gtrbaitt-: Anyone on 4.0b6?  Having issues displaying animated gifs?

07:47  tnzr: hi guys, dumb question.. I made the mistake of opening a jpg from within firefox in windows photo viewer and now I cant seem to get firefox to display jpegs
07:47  tnzr: I even went into the options and the only choices for opening jps are "always ask", "windows photo viewer", "save" and other
07:48  tnzr: what does one have to do to just make firefox show the image?
07:48  tnzr: if I choose other->browse to firefox.exe, it doesnt take.
08:12  CodeWar: do browsers cache tcp connections or create separate socket connections each time

10:24  d34df00d: Hi!
10:24  d34df00d: I'm trying to parse Firefox's database with history, and I've got a little trouble regarding parsing the datetime field.
10:25  d34df00d: Seems like it's in micro/nanoseconds from a certain period of date, but all combinations I could think out of my head lead to either incorrect date at all, or a date in a very distant future.
10:25  d34df00d: Like, say, 40000+ years
10:25  d34df00d: So I wonder how Firefox stores date/time of the visits of the pages in its history.
10:27  vadim_: Hello, I'm getting a "Ошибка: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsIPrefBranch.getCharPref]"  nsresult: "0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://qvd_opensso/content/overlay.js :: anonymous :: line 25"  data: no]" from my extension. Is there a way of getting a more useful error message?

10:37  simonvc: can you still save security exceptions?
