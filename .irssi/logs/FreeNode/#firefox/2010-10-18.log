02:53  Lxndr: Evidence *everywhere* says I have Adobe flash player 10 installed. But when I visit certain websites with firefox, it says I need to upgrade to 10. What is happening?
03:15  desaiu: do all firefox add-ons have the same license as firefox?
03:18 @gavin: no
03:18  desaiu: on addons.mozilla.org, is there a default location where you can find the license of the add-on?
03:19 @gavin: near the bottom of the addon listing page
03:19 @gavin: "Source Code License"
03:19  desaiu: thank you gavin, I didn't see that
04:14  Lxndr: Evidence *everywhere* says I have Adobe flash player 10 installed. But when I visit certain websites with firefox, it says I need to upgrade to 10. But when I try to upgrade, it says I already have it installed. What is happening?

08:46  mrcarrot: i am maintaining the computers in a school and i got a really strange problem with firefox
08:46  mrcarrot: when i open it, it can not show the startpage
08:46  mrcarrot: but if i once refresh, it will load it nicely
08:47  Cork: mrcarrot: does this happen with a new firefox profile?
08:47  mrcarrot: it will give a message about connection beeing interrupted the first time i start firefox
08:47  mrcarrot: Cork: i have been making new profile and reinstalling firefox... nothing helps
08:48  Cork: mrcarrot: try disable the firewall
08:48  mrcarrot: ie is working well in the same computer
08:48  mrcarrot: Cork: i have been trying that too

11:17  nettezzaumana: hi there
11:18  nettezzaumana: i'd like to ask for noobish thing: is defaulted fff fronted GTK ?
11:37  adv_: i'd like to patch firefox's right click to add an action that i want. which source file should i look for?
12:32  nettezzaumana: would anyone respond me to Q: if the default frontend in filthy ff is GTK ?
12:58  ForgeAus: is there some kind of solution these days for using firefox in KDE? I know there was a time where gentoo could bind it to kde or qt instead of GTK but is there some other modern solution? or do kde users still have to put up with GTK dialogs,etc?
12:59  ForgeAus: ther was also some qt wrapper thingy is that still around?
13:06  nettezzaumana: ForgeAus: :)
13:06  nettezzaumana: ForgeAus: there were some additional replacements for dialogs imo ..
13:06  nettezzaumana: but they don't seem to copatible with ff3.5 and higher
13:08  ForgeAus: theres a few options
13:08  ForgeAus: one is the kgtk wrapper
13:08  ForgeAus: if its still around
13:08  ForgeAus: another is gtk themes like oxygen-molecule
13:08  nettezzaumana: ok, i'll check that
13:08  ForgeAus: they look nicer (or even qtcurve's GTK theme or gtk-oxygen-engine
13:09  ForgeAus: but ofthose only the kgtk wrapper (i it works and is still around, will fix dialogs too...
13:09  ForgeAus: the others will just give a kde theme to gtk dialogs
13:09  nettezzaumana: well .. i hope that it will do so
13:10  ForgeAus: but I do agree with you GTK is imho ugly
13:10  ForgeAus: or maybe thats just because i run it from in Kubuntu
13:11  nettezzaumana: ForgeAus: it's not about ugly .. it's just about that it lacks in usability .. it's like night and day .. gtk Vs qt
13:12  ForgeAus: hehe preaching to the choir here!
13:12  ForgeAus: bu then note: I come from a windows background ... nowerdays I'm pretty much an equal-opportunity OS enthusiast tho
13:12  ForgeAus: which is pretty difficult a position to take, at least more than I thought
13:13  nettezzaumana: :) .. you know good what i'm talking about. everyone starts with ubuntu and after some time of fiddling around reaches a KDE and sticks with it
13:13  nettezzaumana: gnome/gtk has no real users who have chosen it by possibility of choice
13:14  ForgeAus: well I don't know everyone I just find gnome mostly makes me want to throw up lol
13:14  nettezzaumana: but just only who did like that because they had no other option left
13:14  nettezzaumana: hehe
13:15  ForgeAus: well it is a more.. complete and supported and conventional choice considering the options other than KDE
13:15  nettezzaumana: sure
13:15  nettezzaumana: but in short: KDE is usually the second occured option for someone starting with using Linux
13:16  nettezzaumana: i'm not using gnome since 1964
13:16  nettezzaumana: :P
13:16  nettezzaumana: i'm just whining sometimes when i have to use a particular crap from there
13:17  nettezzaumana: if firefox is using GTK (in default) it could explain, why i hate firefox so much
13:18  ForgeAus: I don't hate firefox, but I must admit something like Rekonq if it was good enough I'l probably take it in a heartbeat...
13:18  nettezzaumana: ForgeAus: i can't use reconq here because i'm too lazy to update my suse11.0 or fedora10
13:18  ForgeAus: I think the reason firefox uses GTK is probably popularity/usefulness to the maximum number of linux desktops out there
13:19  nettezzaumana: yeah .. it could be hacked out i suppose
13:19  ForgeAus: I don't know much about rpm-based distros
13:19  ForgeAus: except maybe PCLinuxOS
13:19  ForgeAus: apparently not sure if its still the same but KDE4 in the early days apparently sat very nicely on SUSE
13:20  ForgeAus: it seemed really awkward/mismatched on Ubuntu (as in Kubuntu) back then
13:20  nettezzaumana: suse has the best kde4 support and implementation
13:20  nettezzaumana: i can recommend suse to someone using KDE
13:22  ForgeAus: Mandriva is pretty good with KDE too
13:22  ForgeAus: both RPM-based distros that I tend to stay away from... but oneday I'll venture there to test the waters if nothing else
13:23  ForgeAus: but at least for now I'm very happy with kununtu
13:23  ForgeAus: PCLinuxOS is pretty good too from my perspective its just, not as integrated as Kubuntu
13:23  ForgeAus: and it uses apt-get (well the rpm version apt-rpm)
13:24  ForgeAus: so I feel pretty much at home there with my kubuntu background
13:24  ForgeAus: in fact I havn't really had to deal with the fact it uses rpm's at all as yet, apt has been handling it pretty much transparently
13:24  nettezzaumana: ForgeAus: my problem is that i hate ubuntu also :P
13:25  ForgeAus: I Don't hate ubunutu I just resent the Gnome default thingy
13:25  ForgeAus: they do tend to pay way more attention to ubuntu than they do Kubuntu which is sad...
13:25  nettezzaumana: i'm old-skulled unix admin and Linux is for me just a special-purpose OS
13:25  ForgeAus: linux is pretty much a Unix derivative as far as I can tell
13:25  ForgeAus: then again BSD is pretty much the same
13:26  ForgeAus: in a whole different way of course
13:26  nettezzaumana: not really
13:26  nettezzaumana: okay
13:26  nettezzaumana: linux has not a real filesystem
13:26  ForgeAus: then again I'd g oas far as to consider Amiga OS a unix derivative (but yes a far more ... deviated one)
13:27  ForgeAus: you mean ext ?
13:27  nettezzaumana: i can't imagine IT without ZFS
13:27  nettezzaumana: yes
13:27  nettezzaumana: for example
13:27  ForgeAus: XFS and Reiser are of course options...
13:27  ForgeAus: but linux is mroe synonymous with EXT
13:27  ForgeAus: zfs? ...
13:27  nettezzaumana: yes
13:28  ForgeAus: zfs is more solaris than Lnux isn't it?
13:28  nettezzaumana: ZFS is sunos/bsd
13:28  ForgeAus: Apple seemed to be going towards zfs until they had some legal issues
13:28  nettezzaumana: zfs is even everywhere but not on Linux
13:28  ForgeAus: its been on lnux, htere is an opensource implementation of it...
13:28  nettezzaumana: btrfs is stillborn
13:29  ForgeAus: it just hasn't ben taken up for some reason
13:29  ForgeAus: theres ppl saying it won't be...
13:29  nettezzaumana: no, it's a fuse based impl
13:29  ForgeAus: yeah but use based isn't useful for booting from it
13:29  ForgeAus: it needs to be native to it
13:29  nettezzaumana: sure
13:30  ForgeAus: but I'm not worried,  Idon't need zfs, its interesting tho, I'd like to see it happen personally
13:30  ForgeAus: EXT4 seems to be Linux's current option
13:30  nettezzaumana: anyway .. nice chat ForgeAus .. regards. i need to continue with emulating that i'm doing some real work ;)
13:30  ForgeAus: hehe ok cya
13:30  ForgeAus: hav fun
13:30  nettezzaumana: thx, you too

19:30  nocturnal: has anyone noticed that right clicking will stop working in firefox 4 beta? i'm not sure if i should submit this because it's so hard to define. it just stops randomly on all pages opened but it always returns randomly without restarting the browser.
19:30  nocturnal: as if something caught focus.
19:31  nocturnal: ok i might have found out how to workaround it. right clicked in the file download window, worked, tried the menu bar, worked, tried the web page again, worked!

21:00  Cork[home]: dreamon: try firefox safe mode
21:01  geeknik: dreamon: I see Yahoo Deutschland when I check it out. I'm using Firefox 4.0b8pre though.
21:02  dreamon: Cork, Same problem in -safe-mode
21:02  nocturnal: must be local, works for me
21:02  nocturnal: using 4 beta
21:02  Shaba1: Hello guys I am a new unbuntu user.
21:03  Cork[home]: dreamon: what is your useragent?
21:03  Cork[home]: whatsmyuseragent.com
21:04  Shaba1: I normally make shortcuts to sites that I want to go back to when using I.E. they go on my desktop then later I cut them to folders. Is there a way to do that with unbuntu/firefox?
21:04  Cork[home]: Shaba1: do you eamn IE by I.E. ?
21:04  Shaba1: huh?
21:04  dreamon: Cork, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
21:04  Shaba1: do I eamn??? IE???

21:05  Shaba1: Yes
21:05  Shaba1: Internet explorer.
21:05  Shaba1: I am a windows person/systems admine
21:05  Shaba1: admin
21:05  dreamon: Cork, Still safe-mode
21:05  Cork[home]: k, the reason i had to ask is that its a really unusual acronym for ie
21:05  Shaba1: but since I am trying to get a new job I have decided that I need to at least get familiar with linux
21:06  Cork[home]: dreamon: did you get a dialog asking about things to do in safe mode and a "continue in safe mode" button?
21:06  Shaba1: I scrolled back and saw the period Cork.
21:06  Shaba1: Do you happen to know how I would do what I saked
21:06  Shaba1: asked
21:07  Shaba1: or is it even possible
21:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o dolske]
21:07  dreamon: Cork, Yes a dialog asked me many things.. I went on continue in safe-mode (without making any points)
21:08  Cork[home]: Shaba1: i don't think there is any simple way to create url links on the desktop (not that i've ever tried)
21:08  Shaba1: I was afraid of that
21:08  Cork[home]: Shaba1: you might have to go the round about way of creating a lancher and linking it to firefox with the url as an argument
21:09  Shaba1: Right now I am creating bookmarks
21:09  Shaba1: But I just like shortcuts and icons
21:09  Cork[home]: Shaba1: the staring in firefox is actually really nice
21:09  Cork[home]: make it quick and easy to keep loads of links
21:09  Shaba1: staring??
21:10  dreamon: Cork, Shall I deactivate things?
21:10  Cork[home]: Shaba1: if you visit a site in firefox you have a star in the url bar
21:10  Cork[home]: dreamon: that what safe mode does, i donno what else could cause it
21:11  Shaba1: Ok what does that star do
21:11  Cork[home]: Shaba1: it makes it so you can with just a few key strokes find it if you type ex. the title in the url bar
21:12  dreamon: Cork, What about the "Content-type"-Header?
21:12  Cork[home]: Shaba1: if you click it agan you can sort it in the bookmark menu just like a normal bookmark
21:12  Shaba1: Ok thanks cork
21:12  Cork[home]: it will still be posible to find it like before with the url bar
21:12  Cork[home]: dreamon: you could try with a new firefox profile
21:12  Cork[home]: dreamon: but i doubt that will help
21:14  dreamon: Cork, I will give it a try
21:16  Shaba1: I do like firebug on ff btw
21:16  Shaba1: that was my second reason for switching to linux
21:20  dreamon: Cork, Your right.. still dont work.

23:28  DarkUranium: where should I put x86_64 plugins for Firefox in Linux?
23:30  DarkUranium: nvm, I found it
23:31  konr: was it at ~/.mozilla/plugins/ ?
23:32  DarkUranium: nah, I was trying the system folder
23:32  DarkUranium: /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins
23:32  DarkUranium: probably there though, yes
23:32  DarkUranium: (I wanted it system-wide)
23:34  DarkUranium: installed the new flash player plugin =)
23:34  konr: cool :)
23:34  konr: is it working fine?
23:34  DarkUranium: I was positively suprised when I saw they released it after they announced they wouldn't support 64-bit Linux until further notice
23:34  DarkUranium: better than in Windows, actually xD
23:34  konr: wow
23:34  konr: adobe's?
23:35  DarkUranium: http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
23:35  DarkUranium: yup =)
23:35  DarkUranium: it's in the 64-bit releases
23:36  DarkUranium: konr: just playing a HD video on YT perfectly (YouTube makes an excellent flash stress text xD) - a feat that Windows cannot seem to accomplish properly
23:37  konr: DarkUranium: haha
23:37  konr: the main issue I face is speed
23:37  DarkUranium: yeah, it is when you run wrappers or w/e
23:37  konr: I can't play a video on fullscreen on Linux :(
23:37  DarkUranium: works fine here
23:37 * DarkUranium tries fullscreen
23:38  DarkUranium: yup, works fine =)
23:38  konr: good to know! :)
23:38  konr: I even tried running chromium, but I guess it was the old player
23:39  DarkUranium: yeah, I've tried it
23:39  DarkUranium: I think I'll stick with FF =D
23:39  DarkUranium: esp. with FF4 coming (<3 HTML5)
23:39  DarkUranium: wb localhost
23:40  konr: haha
23:40  konr: I stick with it because of vimperator!
23:40  konr: (vi keybindings and features for firefox)
23:41  DarkUranium: vi features for Firefox? O_O
23:41  DarkUranium: there exists such a thing?
23:42  konr: indeed! and it's very useful
23:42  konr: you can create macros and stuff like that
23:42  konr: http://vimperator.org/vimperator
23:43  DarkUranium: gonna try it some other day
23:43  DarkUranium: working on a proof-of-concept here
23:43  konr: plugin?
23:47  DarkUranium: no, it's not for Firefox
