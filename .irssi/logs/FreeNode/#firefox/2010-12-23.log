02:36  qq99: I have a question/comment, for ff3.6, the box-shadow property will add height/layout to an item, which is undesirable imo...  e.g., a div with min-height:100% has a box-shadow attached in the down-right direction.. this will make it >100% and add a tiny scrollbar, which Chrome/Safari renderers do not
02:36  qq99: is there a fix (in ff4beta?) ?
02:37  qq99: maybe overflow-y on the container.. I'll try my own possible solution

09:31  _stefanos_: now, I do the same procedure with the new tab and the memory follows the same procedure as before for multiple windows and it increments at the amount of 120MB.
09:32 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 107 seconds
09:32  _stefanos_: i close the tabs and my memory remains at 120MB and it might (occasionally would happened this) decrease to 90MB only.
09:32  _stefanos_: isn't it a memory leak bug?
09:34  _stefanos_: I forgot to mentioned that the amount of threads is 22 to 24 based on the workload of the website.
09:34  bogomil: _stefanos_ try this: http://mzl.la/9bB1FY
09:36  _stefanos_: my PC is very fast, Intel Core 2 Duo @ 1.80GHz, 3GB RAM. If I ran Firefox in safe mode with all options disabled runs like rocket. Still though not a solution.
09:37  _stefanos_: 's/ran/run/g'
09:38  bogomil: _stefanos_ did you upgrade flash player?
09:38  _stefanos_: yeap
09:38  _stefanos_: the latest one is installed

21:10  Alestan: So for anyone who is interested, I just upgraded to firefox 3.6.13-1linuxmint1 and it seems the firefox executable is no longer on the path.

21:47 @kbrosnan: molqr: keyconfig but it is a tricky extension to use
21:49  molqr: thanks kbrosnan :)
22:13  Zilly: Is there an extension that blocks javascript from all pages except specified domains?
22:17  Alarm: hello, which file contains the firefox preferences in linux systems ?

22:48  nvictor: yo!
22:48  nvictor: what was that extension that downloads video or media embedded in pages again?
22:49  nvictor: i can't find it (i find several others tho)
22:49  nvictor: it had a blue, yellow, red icon :D
22:53  Adamantus: Is there any point in having noscript? I mean I have to enable ever site I need which surely removes any protection is might give me? This has been bugging me for a while now so needed to ask.
22:54  nvictor: Adamantus: testing purposes
22:54  nvictor: that's the only use i can find for it
22:55  Adamantus: ok
22:56  Adamantus: I was talking about the ff addon by the way not the html tag
22:57  nvictor: yes i know
22:57  nvictor: when i am developing
22:57  nvictor: i like sometimes to turn off javascript
22:57  nvictor: no wait
22:57  nvictor: noscript doesnt work this way?
22:58  nvictor: Adamantus: nevermind what i said :)
22:59  nvictor: i saw that addon and thought it was what i thought it was
22:59  nvictor: they should have picked a better name
22:59  Adamantus: With noscript its off by default.
23:00  nvictor: ah if that's the case
23:00  nvictor: for example i sometimes use linx for the same purpose
23:00  nvictor: you want to know if your page degrade gracefully or something they said
23:01  nvictor: especially when there are more and more tools for people with disabilities
23:07  Adamantus: Yes I see the use for degradation of functionality but there are probably simpler addons to achieve that.
