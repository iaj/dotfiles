00:22  wooden: Is there a built-in way to dump all the tabs of a firefox window to a text file containing their URLs?  Or to export a per-window session file or some kind?
00:50  SophJ: hi there, firefox crashed and i dont know what pages i was just on
00:56  SophJ: is there a file where it says where you downloaded an image from?
01:02  wooden: SophJ: ctrl-h to bring up the history window.

10:03  barra_home: actually: atom feed, in this case
10:03  barra_home: see: http://wiki.parpg.net/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom
10:04  barra_home: on IE8, you see an author field there
10:04  barra_home: on Firefox 3.6.12 it's missing
10:04 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 82 seconds
10:04  barra_home: just wanted to make sure that I'm not the only one who's affected by it, before I dig deeper
10:19  barra_home: heya yak
10:40  sybariten: anyone else have experience of FF suddenly losing the char encoding and reverting to something else?
10:40  sybariten: totally out of the blue, always happens in the midst of a session.
10:40  sybariten: should be noted that i have noticed the same behaviour with other apps as well...
11:52  vandenoever: is it possible to move the caret one line forward with javascript?
11:53  vandenoever: in a contentEditable paragraph, i would like to move the caret position programmatically
11:53  vandenoever: i can do this in webkit with selection.modify("move", "forward", "line");

12:18  paranoidi: how can I get javascript alerts back in FF4 .. I chose to prevent them once and the fracking thing was persistent
12:22  paranoidi: nvm, my bad ;P
13:51  alelos: hey guys anyone knows if pentadactyl works with firefox-nightly 4.0b8?
13:52  alelos: i think it worked (with bugs) for b7 but i cant get it to work with b8
14:10  Milos_SD: HI
14:11  Milos_SD: In Firefox 4.0beta8 where is flash cached video located on linux? It was in /tmp, but now it is not there. :)
14:34  goldenboy87: hi, i've a question about firefox: often it uses about 600mb ram, for example if i watch photos online by using 1 tab
14:35  goldenboy87: seems like firefox can't empty the cache on default, or what ever... is there other option except restart firefox?

15:02  stix: Hi guys. Why is it that many webpages suddenly think that I am browsing from a mobile device? showmyipaddress.eu shows: User Agent (browser):   Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101027 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.12
15:02  stix: isn't that fine?
15:06  moo_: stix: which web pages?
15:06  moo_: stix: they are probably using Wurfl database
15:06  moo_: stix: test your browser here http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/
15:09  stix: pages like http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/, newz.dk and lots of others
15:09  stix: it is beginning to be very annoying
15:10  stix: what should I do on http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ ?
15:15 @kbrosnan: well with a ms sight doing that i would blame some .net libaray
15:16  stix: it is clear for me, that it is my browser and not the sites
15:16  stix: since I experience it on so many sites
15:20 @kbrosnan: you could try setting a more common Firefox 3.6 UA: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12
15:20 @kbrosnan: or at least get rid of the ubuntu added stuff
15:20  stix: okay, but where can I set this myself? It doesn't seem to be listed in about:config.
15:21 @kbrosnan: it is settable in about:config or use the user agent switcher extension
15:23 @kbrosnan: general.useragent.override
15:23 @kbrosnan: create it if not present, right click > new > string

16:02  Cursarion: hmm
16:02  Cursarion: Firefox on F13
16:02  Cursarion: it used 50% of CPU and 800-900 MB of RAM
16:02  Cursarion: and a subprocess called plugin-containe used another 50% and some memory too
16:02  Cursarion: so I disabled Firebug and restarted browser
16:03  Cursarion: Firefox went to 5-10% and 110 MB
16:03  Cursarion: but the plugin-containe subprocess started again, and was again going crazy
16:03  Cursarion: Firefox seemed to keep on working after I killed the plugin-containe, but what should I do to prevent it from going crazy?
16:16  swimrr: any thoughts why I can't access hertz.com?

17:30  Kingsy: alright ppl, got a weird one, all of a sudden in FF when I was using roundcube I clicked reply to an email and got this error --> The page isn't redirecting properly, Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.             *   This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept
17:30  Kingsy: cookies
17:30  Kingsy: the problem definatly isnt to do with the server or roundcube cos it works on every other computer I have tried on FF
17:31  Kingsy: I have tried making sure cookies are enabled and clearing the cookies.. but still the same error.. anyone got any ideas?
17:51 --- boonhead is now known as bh-off
18:01  Kingsy: hmm it probably needs the session to be deleted manually I will try that
18:25  markand: hello
18:26  markand: i'm guessing why firefox store its files under ~/.mozilla/firefox while thunderbird stores its files under ~/.thunderbird
18:28  jvargas: hi
18:29  jvargas: why a flash file is displayed with distinct height when inserted with embed tag, than when inserted using object tag?
18:30  jvargas: when using 'embed' tag only, the SWF is shown correctly, but when using 'object' and 'embed' together, the height is greater.
18:59  shane4ubuntu: In thunderbird, what exactly does the archive button do?
21:25  wooden: How long does it take to get your first push of data once you submit your mirror details?
21:25  wooden: mt
