09:00  overture: hello, english speakers awake at midnight
09:00  overture: *crickets/tumbleweeds*
09:01  overture: i'm having trouble with links in ff: i can't get them to open in the same tab
09:02  overture: when i left click, i get the popup blocker message; when i right click, i only get options to open it in a new tab or new window, not same tab
09:04  overture: usually i would just left click it to open it in the same tab, but some websites interfere somehow, so i need a better way
09:26  Gryllida: OmNomSequitur: does every link behave this way? (try clicking 'images' at http://www.google.com)
09:26  Gryllida: er
09:26  Gryllida: overture:
09:26  overture: no, just certain ones
09:27  Gryllida: how do those links behave in another browseR?
09:27  Gryllida: s/R/r/
09:27  overture: also, i can't find a 'images' link at google.com
09:27  Gryllida: at the left top
09:27  overture: i am using https-everywhere, and there is nothing at the left top of https://encrypted.google.com/
09:27  overture: that's got nothing to do with this though
09:28  overture: the vast majority of links work ok
09:29  Gryllida: how do the problematic links work in another browser?
09:31  overture: internet explorer froze before i could click anything
09:31  overture: ok, it unfroze. ie always opens a new window for that link, which is the wrong behavior
09:31  overture: even if i choose "Open" from the context menu
09:32  Gryllida: okay, this is how the webmaster made it for that site. maximum we can do is allow the popup in firefox
09:33  Gryllida: webmaster made it open in a new window either way
09:33  overture: i am not concerned about the webmaster's opinion
09:33  overture: what might the webmaster have done, and how do i counteract it?
09:34  Cork: overture: whats the problem?
09:34  Cork: overture: you can force everything to open in the current tab
09:35  overture: ok how
09:35  Gryllida: o_O
09:35  Cork: one sec
09:35  Cork: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14205/
09:35  Gryllida: that's new to me, I'm watching
09:36  overture: that is the cheapest, weakest solution. however, it is one of the possible solutions i listed, and i'm trying it now
09:38  Cork: overture: the links is opend with js, there isn't much other choices
09:38  overture: while i'm messing around, has anyone not installed session manager yet?
09:38  Cork: not installed YET?
09:38  Cork: i never install it
09:38  overture: Cork: i looked at the source, it's just an a tag with an href attribute
09:38  overture: no js involved, right?
09:38  Cork: overture: hmm wrong extension if it is >_>
09:39 * Cork checks again
09:39  overture: ok, i restarted firefox and it didn't restart itself. let me try restarting it again...
09:40  overture: and when i tried to view addons it didn't give a dialog. it's failing, right? should i kill it from task manager?
09:42  overture: screw this, i'm killing it right now
09:43  Cork: hmm
09:43  Cork: overture: you could try about:config, chan changing browser.link.open_newwindow to 1
09:43  overture: now waiting 2 minutes for this to settle down...
09:43  overture: Cork: what's that do?
09:43  Cork: "chan changing" = "changing
09:43  Cork: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.link.open_newwindow
09:44  overture: now waiting 2 minutes to click that link...
10:11  Fenda: http://support.mozilla.com/rm/questions/750266 - localStorage.setItem is very slow (im on 3.6.12)
10:14  overture: ok, that extension works for now, so i'll ask later when i refine my question
10:15  overture: Cork: why no session manager? doesn't it bother you when firefox decides to dump your previous session?
10:17  Cork: overture: thats actually the reason, i've only ever lost sessions when i use things like tmp or session manager
10:18  overture: that's weird
10:18  Cork: so i went over to use the built in session manager, and its always treated me farly
10:18  overture: firefox likes to dump my session if i click the wrong button on some dialog when it exits
10:18  Cork: overture: i've configured firefox to always remember, so i don't even get those dialogs
10:19  overture: i mean, why would my answer to the exit dialog determine what happens next time i start firefox?
10:19  overture: the whole concept is silly
10:19  overture: session manager is the only workaround i've found
10:19  Cork: overture: it determins if firefox adds the open tabs to sessionstore.js
10:19  overture: yeah, why should it?
10:19  Cork: thats why it affects the NEXT time
10:20  Cork: overture: cause if you don't want the tabs, why spend time saving it to disk?
10:20  overture: if i don;'t install session manager, i'd have to go back in time to get firefox to restore my previous session
10:21  Cork: overture: if you always want firefox to remember your tabs, just configure it to do so
10:22  overture: there's that "just" again
10:22  overture: and i did configure it to do so, by installing session manager, since that's the only way i know
10:23  Cork: overture: tools > options > general > "When i open firefox start all my tabs and windows from last time"
10:23  overture: oh, that one
10:24  overture: somehow that didn't do what i expected and i started disregarding it, and now i forgot why
10:24  overture: so disregard this line and the previous two i suppose
10:25  overture: is there a way to get firefox to reload the previous session from cache, instead of fetching fresh copies of everything?
10:26  Cork: not sure, haven't looked to much into those parts
10:27  Cork: (in a while)
10:27  overture: what was it like a while ago?
10:27  Cork: i think it was back in ff2 or 1.5 it used to poll the server to see if the page was updated
10:28  Cork: if it wasn't it loaded from cache if it had it
10:28  Cork: and if the server didn't answer it showd an error dialog
10:28  Cork: (while still showing the cache page)
10:29  overture: seems like ff3 won't even try cache when restoring a session

12:48  Kingsy: just wondering, got a weird issue, I have firefox installed on windows 7 and maybe twice a day it seems to just eat RAM, literally windows task manager said it was using 800 MB of ram and it was going up constantly until I crashed out.. anyone seen this before?
12:49  Gryllida: Kingsy: anything visible at about:crashes  ?
12:55  Kingsy: oh hmmm I didnt check

14:10  gynter: hello, is there an extensions which automatically saves the source code of the page on every refresh/access?

16:37  nesuno: Hi! I use ff 3.6.12 ,but all google code project site gives me "500 Server Error". In that cases I'm forced to switch to ...
16:38  nesuno: opera i.e.. How can I solve this problem (browse these sites) with ff?
16:43 @kbrosnan: nesuno: 500 is a server error
16:45 @kbrosnan: nesuno: you could try http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+Troubleshooting but I can't be sure that any of the steps will help
17:23  nesuno: kbrosnan: I started with a new profile, so I don't think basic troubleshooting will help. Yes, http 500 is a server side error, but I always get this error with ff, and the page always works with opera.
17:24  nesuno: kbrosnan: It is not an easily reproducible bug, because sometimes it is working, but mostly not. I tried to disable all my ff extensions, clear the cache, but also got 500.
18:17  LOGAN: is there an addon to remove 'installed' Microsoft Apple and Google plugins from FireFox?
18:21 @kbrosnan: no, they are installed to system locations
18:21 @kbrosnan: Firefox will only provide a disable funtion
18:22  LOGAN: shame, im already looking for a good solution scince that .net plugin
18:22  LOGAN: I rather uninstall the software responsible for the plugins than firefox
18:37  LOGAN: ill manually edit the all.js file then
18:42  Fnord^: Has anyone made an addon to upload images/links to an arbitrary url, with custom parameters? There's like a gazillion imageshack/picasa/imgur/blah/wtf/crap uploaders, but nothing for a custom website running gallery2, or even more obscure software
18:47  josh-N: i think i found a bug, but have no idea how to describe it. anyone want to take a look? it probably has something to do with hidden divs still causing a line-break although they shouldn't.
18:49 @kbrosnan: have a page that shows your problem?
18:49 @kbrosnan: and version of Firefox?

21:47  roadkill: Gryllida, it's not sufficient to associate with /usr/bin/java though, if that's what you meant. I tried that. there is no way I can set the needed -jar parameter in the FF interface
21:48 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 124 seconds
21:48  Gryllida: Hans_Henrik: default download directory (my documents/downloads)
21:49  Gryllida: roadkill: I ancountered .jar files as Firefox themes and was pretty upset at them not opening with firefox itself by default; so we basically have same issue
21:49  Gryllida: like .xpi = extension, .jar = theme, .jar didn't install automatically
21:50  Hans_Henrik: Gryllida: not for me, i managed to find it, and it was in %appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\Desktop Background.bmp (and funfact: regarldess of the original format of the pic, it is converted to bmp...)
21:51  Gryllida: Hans_Henrik: you mean set as desktop background? that path is what the windows OS takes the desktop bg from
21:51  Gryllida: it's the only way to make something be a desktop bg - put it to that path, which includes the extension
21:52  Gryllida: file extension
21:53  Hans_Henrik: i believe you are miss-informed but w/e (and im quite sure there is a winapi call to change it)

22:41  lteo: how do i find out what DNS servers firefox is using internally to resolve hostnames?
22:42  xangua: right clic in the network icon> show info i believe
22:44  lteo: xangua: hm doesn't look like it's there
22:45  lteo: here's the issue.. my workstation uses a local DNS server that can translate some private hostnames (e.g. foo.bar.custom_tld) to internal IPs. the machine correctly resolves those private hostnames but firefox does not (though it used to).
22:45  lteo: this is firefox 3.6.12 on the mac
