18:55  jgb: I'm trying to run ff 4.0b8 on Ubuntu. Running ./firefox launches the install firefox, 3.6. Running ./firefox-bin launches ff 4, but it ignores the lib files that came with it (in the same dir), and looks for them in a bunch of other places... how do I make it use the libs in the working directory?

22:11  minaguib: Hey folks. I'm looking for an extension to help me debug compressed javascript.  Ideally, I'd be able to input a URL1 and have it dynamically alter a resource load to use URL2, that way I can load the uncompressed JS instead of the compressed one. Ideas ?
22:12  minaguib: (the compressed file referenced in the page via script src=... is 1 large line, so debugging stuff in it with firebug is impossible)
