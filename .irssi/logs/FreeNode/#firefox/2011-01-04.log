11:14  Pegasus_RPG_: Hello. If this is the place to ask about development questions, I'm just trying to build Thunderbird on Linux following this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Simple_Thunderbird_build  and am getting build errors
11:16  Pegasus_RPG_: e.g the first line of comm-central/mozilla/js/src/ctypes/CTypes.cpp appears corrupt
11:17  Pegasus_RPG_: in fact there are a number of corrupt lines in it

14:59  doudou: hi, how firefox doing nothing can use 1% of cpu? is it normal? i expect firefox to do nothing when i do nothing (no download, no script running)
15:01 @kbrosnan: animated gifs? unless you disabled javascript there could be some script checking conditions.
15:01 @kbrosnan: plugins?
15:23  doudou: i dont know, is there a way to stop firefox sending in clear or crypted, "HI I AM FIREFOX RUNNING ON FEDORA14 WITH LINUX 2.6.34 AND ...." seem so stupid to claim that for obvious security reasons?
15:30 @kbrosnan: doudou: user agent switcher
15:39  doudou: i found, is there security dangers installing plug ins?
15:39  doudou: why is there add-ons and plug-ins? what difference for user?
15:53  x29a: hey folks, im on ubuntu 10.4 and just updated to thunderbird 3.1.7. when there is a new mail, there is a tiny star on the mailbox which i barely can see. before it was made bold and red and i dont know. can i change that back somehow?
15:53  x29a: ups, autoforward from #mozilla to here, sorry about that.
16:00 @kbrosnan: x29a: irc.mozilla.org for the thunderbird channel
16:00  x29a: thanks
16:00  x29a: im trying some themes
16:01  x29a: maybe there is a plain one
16:20  grey: Is there a way to enable font anti-aliasing/cleartype in firefox through CSS? I'm noticing the default rendering appears to suck, compared to IE anyways (And yeah, objectively, I know some people dislike cleartype)
16:43  DannyButterman: HI there
16:44  DannyButterman: Does some one know how to open office files (.xls, .doc, .docx, .xlsx...) within firefox ?
16:45  DannyButterman: And using OpenOffice for opening the MS Office files
16:48  AimHere: Doesn't firefox ask you for an external app if you attempt to open any file it doesn't know about?
16:49  DannyButterman: AimHere: It does. But in this case, I want the file to be opened within the browser, not in a dedicated window
16:50 @kbrosnan: DannyButterman: not possible, requires a browser plugin that neither open office or microsoft would need to write
16:51  AimHere: Well if there aren't plugins for that, you may have to write them yourself
16:51 @kbrosnan: -neither
16:51  AimHere: The reason you can do it in IE is because Microsoft writes the browser AND the office suite
16:53  DannyButterman: kbrosnan: but I can open xls, xlsx files with openoffice. And openoffice can display OO files within firefox. So it shouldn't be too difficult to make it work ?
16:54  DannyButterman: AimHere: OpenOffice 3.2 provides a mozilla plugin for browser integration
16:55  AimHere: So perhaps a modification to that plugin might be the smartest move.
16:55 @kbrosnan: the plugin would need to register mime types for the files it is capable of opening
16:56 @kbrosnan: about:plugins can display the list of possible file types
16:56 @kbrosnan: er mime types
17:00  DannyButterman: kbrosnan: about:plugins says that both openoffice and ms office files are handled through mozplugger.
17:01 @kbrosnan: most likely the ms files are not sent with the mime type specified
17:01  AimHere: Might it be that the mime types associated with the .doc or .xls files don't match the mime types that the plugin is set to handle?
17:32  inkbottle: Hi, I used to have a cookies exception to block youtube; and the clean history settings saying not to clean sites preferences. And everything was ok. But just now, when I clean history, the youtube cookies exception is removed.
17:33  inkbottle: Any hint about that?
17:35 @kbrosnan: inkbottle: make sure site preferences are not set in the clear all history dialog
17:36  inkbottle: kbrosnan: yes they are not set
17:36  inkbottle: i was aware of that
17:40  inkbottle: Well, I'll ask that again when there is more people :-)
17:40  inkbottle: bye

20:49  michal_: how can i make connetion shorter connection time in minefild??
21:01  hstefan: hey. I'm running firefox 3.6.12 here but I'm getting too much unresponding scripts here and I have no idea about how to track the errors source, can you help me?
21:01  hstefan: by the way, i'm using Arch Linux as OS
21:02 --- Guest50861 is now known as Cork[home]
21:12  Cork[home]: hstefan: start by testing with your extensions disabled
21:12  Cork[home]: (safe mode is the simplest way to do that)
21:19  hstefan: Cork[home]: same problem in safe mode
21:19  Cork[home]: ouch
21:20  Cork[home]: try diable your plugins, its not likly, but...
21:20  Cork[home]: *disable
21:20  hstefan: I would guess that's flash's fault, as always
21:20  Cork[home]: (safe mode only disables your extensions)
21:20  Cork[home]: hstefan: 32 or 64?
21:21  hstefan: oh, wait
21:21  hstefan: it's working now, without the addons
21:21  hstefan: (plugins still enabled)
21:21  Cork[home]: extensions is the most likly cause
21:21  Cork[home]: finding witch one is the boing part though
21:22  hstefan: nah... I have just one
21:22  hstefan: haha
21:22  Cork[home]: lol
21:22  Cork[home]: that sounds like a tough thing to solve ;)
21:22  hstefan: yeah, really tough
21:23  hstefan: anyway, thanks
21:23  Cork[home]: hstefan: might actually be worth testing with just disabling the extension and run in normal mode
21:23  Cork[home]: there is a few other things disabled in safe mode
21:23  hstefan: sounds like a plan
21:23  hstefan: I'll test this out
21:27  hstefan: haha, guess what I figured out? Flash was disabled in safe mode and I got no problems, now I enabled flash plugin and it crashes, please, kill that sh*t called flash
