00:18  Accelerator: I'm trying to write a wget script to execute post data. The script is written fine. I can subscribe to people, but it won't unsusbcribe. I can't even directly execute unsubcribe from my browser via unsub.php?user=441&notification=1, but that doesn't work. Here's the crazy thing though. If I use Firefox's HackBar, or TamperData to re-execute, it works.
00:18  Accelerator: Any ideas?

06:49  worinogood: hi
06:50  worinogood: can i run 2 firefoxes at the same time somehow?
06:51 @kbrosnan: firefox -P -no-remote
06:51  worinogood: aha, is this the terminal command, so simple?
06:52  worinogood: please give me a short sentence what the command is doing
06:53 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Command_Line_Options#-no-remote
06:54  worinogood: i started the search engoine now thnaks a lot!
07:03  worinogood: kbrosnan, ok i want to have 1 browser for working and one for private stuff. firefox is my favorite browser i use for private stuff now. will the no-remote command create a completely separated version or so of firefox, that i can also close and start again?
07:05 @kbrosnan: worinogood: no remote requires a second profile, it is fully separate from the first profile
07:05  worinogood: so if someone hacks my firefox number one, somehow, he will be unable to access the other firefoxes profile?
07:09  worinogood: i mean will it be possible to detect, that both firefoxes are related to each other? this i have to make with tor or proxy then i guess
07:15  worinogood: kbrosnan, now when i started firefox again, all plug ins and everything is gone
07:18  worinogood: how can i switch between the 2 profiles?
07:22 @kbrosnan: worinogood: what do you mean switch?
07:23  worinogood: i created another profile
07:23  worinogood: then both were open
07:24  worinogood: after closing both and starting again something chnaged
07:24  worinogood: i just read about the switch extension
07:25 --- XmasMoo is now known as Moo--
07:27  worinogood: i thought that i could chose a profile after starting again
07:29  worinogood: all plug-ins and everything is gone somehow, maybe iu made a mistake
07:29  worinogood: the original profile should start up automatically after closing firefox right?
07:33  worinogood: ah i got iz
07:33  worinogood: it*
07:33  worinogood: now i just have to make this command into a button on the desktop
07:43  worinogood: I created another profile while running firefox using -P no-remote, now i want to run both profiles at the same time, but it states that one instance is already running
07:45 @kbrosnan: worinogood: just run the command again
07:47  worinogood: nice
07:48  worinogood: kbrosnan: wonderful thank you
07:59  Whiskey: anyone try to set up a weave server here?
08:02  worinogood: not me

10:21  cads: hello
10:22  cads: I was wondering if I could find some help installing the 4.0b8 beta release of firefox here on linux
10:23  cads: I've unpacked the files but when I do simply ./firefox it just runs my existing ff version
10:23  cads: is there an installation procedure I'm missing?

14:02  Cork[home]: your running the one from the repo?
14:02  dylan_noktum: yeah
14:02  Cork[home]: might be the apparmor mseeing up
14:02  Cork[home]: donno
14:02  Cork[home]: *messing
14:02  dylan_noktum: apparmor?
14:03  Cork[home]: ya, it dictates what programs are allowed to do

16:17  jblack: Good morning. yesterday I started firefox via the console. I just notiticed this morning that I have about 12 lines of "SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN" on the console.
16:18  jblack: I don't know when or how I triggered it, but it seemed appropriate to mention the imossible happened somewhere at some time. :)
16:20  jblack: My guess it is happened while I was trying to do facebook this morning while my roomie was uploading pictues and videos on my cramped little dsl line.
17:42  jkroon: hi all, does anybody here have experience with using -moz-transform: rotate?  I'm seeing some weird fonts artifacts and is wondering whether i'm doing something wrong or whether there is some kind of known issues?

18:38  satdav: jkroon: can you please paste ban the issue I will look into that for you
18:39  satdav: the logs of the issue you get

18:49  jkroon: satdav, i'm trying to construct a simplified case where it breaks - but what all do you need - I reckon a screenshot of what I actually see would probably be benificial too.
18:50  satdav: yes
18:50  satdav: jkroon: can I ask you to post on the forums at support.mozilla.com
18:52  jkroon: satdav, you can, will do if I can actually get a screenshot - it still happens but some of the changes I've made seems to improve the situation to the point where if the screen refreshes it fixes itself so having trouble taking a screenshot.
18:52  satdav: OK what os you using
18:53  jkroon: Gentoo Linux
18:53  jkroon: FF 3.6.12
18:55  jkroon: ok, does the forum provide a way of posting images?
18:56  jkroon: satdav, could it perhaps be a software mesa implementation issue?
18:56  jkroon: ie, that'll it'll work on something that supports dri/glx?
19:20  satdav: jkroon: is it a addon you are having issues with
19:33  jkroon: satdav, i think it's an X11 issue - on two other machines (SuSE with same version of FF), and different Gentoo install (FF 3.6.3) as well as on windows (FF 3.5) seems to work just fine.  Anyway, broken one looks like http://www.uls.co.za/screenie.png ...
19:34  satdav: oh you need to update your firefox
19:34  satdav: jkroon: can you update to 3.6.13
19:36  jkroon: satdav, i'm retiring the specific machine in question in the next few days anyway, seeing that it works everywhere else I'm not going to bother.  and i very seldomly use the 3.6.3 box for anything nowadays.
19:36  satdav: OK
19:37  satdav: jkroon: do you have a link to the addon you are talking about and I will get it removed from the list
19:38  jkroon: satdav, it's the -moz-transform css style.  it works - i'm pretty sure it's something else in the GUI stack, same version of FF works correctly on the SuSE boxen.
19:40  satdav: jkroon: does the latest build work on it
19:42  jkroon: it works on three of the four test platforms - it's only on this one netbook that it doesn't actually work as it turns out.  i'll quickly test 3.6.13 for you ... may take a few minutes.
19:58  paddy_: I got a new computer and copied the /home directory of my old one on to an external disk, where are the firefox saved passwords and preferences stored and how do I import them?

21:36  Birdman3131: Firefox issue. 3.6.13 on win 7 x64. FF will randomly freeze up on me. Often when clicking links but at other times as well. If I right click FF in the taskbar and choose "Close window" the window will not close however it will instantly unfreeze.
