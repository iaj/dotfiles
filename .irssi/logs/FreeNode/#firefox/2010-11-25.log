13:02  Gryllida: SingAlong: did you try it on latest xul runner?
13:03  SingAlong: Gryllida: nah havent tried. I tried it on my ubuntu 10.10 ff 3.6.12. Was planning to install 4.0 beta7. So wanted to know if it worked
13:03  SingAlong: Gryllida: oh if it only depends on xulrunner that should be fine :)
13:04  Gryllida: It only depends on xul runner.

13:11  lixinfish: 2. I can't use fcitx to input pinyin in it, but firefox 3.6 and chrome working fine..
13:12  lixinfish: anyone help?

13:29  lixinfish: so..is this channel do any support to beta version?
13:30  Gryllida: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13505/
13:30  Gryllida: ^ to remove title bar
13:30  Gryllida: 2. I don't know what fcitx or pinyin is, so a rephrasing might help.
13:31  Gryllida: And ya, beta support would be here.
13:31  lixinfish: I already tried that addon, but doesn't work..
13:34  lixinfish: Gryllida: http://goo.gl/lSJyQ
13:34  lixinfish: a screenshot
13:34  lixinfish: Gryllida: how can I remove the top title bar?
13:35  Gryllida: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/93611/ - does it work there?
13:37  lixinfish: Gryllida: "Not available for your platform"
13:38  lixinfish: it says..
13:38  Gryllida: hm
13:38  lixinfish: In chrome there's an option like "Use system title bar and borders"
13:39  lixinfish: and I'm wondering if firefox has any similar settings?
13:39  lixinfish: btw, firefox-beta7 is really fast~~
13:39  Gryllida: not default
13:39  Gryllida: only an addon can do it
13:39  Gryllida: I'm trying addon on ubuntu 10.10 now
13:39  lixinfish: Gryllida: thank you
13:42  Gryllida: Error: document.getElementById("titlebar") is null
13:42  Gryllida: Source file: chrome://hidecaption/content/HideCaption.js
13:42  Gryllida: Line: 188
13:42  Gryllida: Email its developer then to fix the issue. State your os and addon version.
13:49  lixinfish: Gryllida: ok, I'll see it~
13:49  lixinfish: btw, another issue is that firefox-beta's font render seems not that good.
13:49  lixinfish: fonts in firefox 3.6 and chrome look good, but have some like "sawtooth" in beta
13:49  lixinfish: is there any options about font render?
13:53  Gryllida: ya
13:53  Gryllida: I turned off font smoothing
13:53  Gryllida: it looks a bit better

13:59  Gryllida: ?
13:59  lixinfish: Gryllida: I'm trying..
14:00  lixinfish: Gryllida: network is slow..
14:00  Gryllida: burg: hi
14:02  burg: anyone could please help me understand why Firefox is not caching my images correctly even though I'm preloading them.... http://www.9folds.com/site/ariel-schlesinger/grass-hole/  ?  Only when loading the page second time, all images are cached. Chrome seems to working fine with this....
14:03  lixinfish: Gryllida: not fixed.. It only can change fonts, but does nothing to rendering/smoothing..
14:03  burg: hi hi
14:05  Gryllida: burg: no idea, same in safe mode? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode
14:06  burg: Gryllida: does it cache right for you on the first load ?
14:07  Gryllida: lixinfish: pick a font which is rendered fine, and also peek in system - preferences - appearance - fonts - details
14:07  Gryllida: burg: after I load the page, how do I check whether it cached?
14:08  burg: Gryllida: firebug....
14:08  lixinfish: Gryllida: I used the same settings, both in firefox 3.6 and chrome, it's working fine. just beta version looking a litter weired.
14:09  Gryllida: burg: where do I look for it in firebug?
14:10  burg: Gryllida: in the NET tab... you'll see the files loading two times if you load the page for the first time (or clear cache)... only at the second page load - all files are cached
14:10  Gryllida: lixinfish: maximum I can suggest is change the font using that addon. or wait here for a developer to say something about font changes.
14:10  Gryllida: burg: ok. trying now.
14:11  lixinfish: Gryllida: hmm, I'll be waiting...
14:23  Gryllida: burg: I loaded it first time, files loaded once.
14:23  burg: but when you prest the NEXT button (on the right)... it loads it again...
14:23  burg: even though it's cached
14:24  burg: **press
14:24  burg: Gryllida: are ou a mozilla developer?
14:24  Gryllida: burg: I've developed some addons, and participate in support
14:25  burg: :) cool
14:26  Gryllida: it loaded several dozens or images, I clicked 'next', it loaded 1 more
14:26  Gryllida: of images.
14:27  burg: that's not good... that 1 image was already preloaded befoe
14:27  burg: before
14:27  burg: and has correct caching headers
14:27  Gryllida: but the page changed.. it has new image displayed
14:27  burg: yep... but that image should already be cached on the browser
14:28  Gryllida: it didn't load first time.
14:28  sep: are there any way i can tell firefox to whilelist a whole subnet in the internal pop up blocker ?
14:28  Gryllida: ah, it did, let me look burg, I noticed it earlier in the get lines
14:29  Gryllida: sep: The toolbar features a popup blocker (with whitelist configuration) https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7158/
14:31  Gryllida: burg: surprisingly response headers have exactly same date and time
14:31  Gryllida: for both images
14:32  burg: yep... it's the same image... that's okay
14:32  sep: thanks for the tip. but it sounds overkill for what i need
14:33  Gryllida: sep: you also can add a domain to popup blocker in the exceptions window
14:33  Gryllida: not regexps though like blah.*.something.com
14:34  sep: i only need to whiltelist 192.168.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/8 and those
14:35  sep: a noscript way like 192.168.0   would also be ok
14:35  Icaria: anyone know why I can't get this to work? http://kb.mozillazine.org/Locking_preferences
14:35  Gryllida: what happens when you try?
14:35  Icaria: nothing
14:36  Icaria: I'm trying to perma-set the browser.download.lastDir setting
14:36  Icaria: followed those intructions to the letter
14:36  Icaria: (the local-settings method, not the byte-offet one)
14:36  sep: Gryllida, it's blocked
14:48  Gryllida: Icaria: can you pastebin your files content and your files pathes using pastebin.mozilla.org?
14:52  Icaria: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/865544
14:53 --- TheHe|AFK is now known as TheHe
14:55  Icaria: just tried prepending a // to the beginning of the local-settings.js file as well, still no worky
15:02  Gryllida: Icaria: does '/home/icaria/programmes/firefox/firefox' exist?
15:02  Gryllida: where is the executable located?
15:05  Icaria: exactly where you guessed
15:11  Gryllida: hm
15:12  Gryllida: Icaria: try putting the second one in ~/programmes/firefox/defaults/pref/local-settings.js
15:14  Icaria: nope, doesn't work either
15:28  Icaria: well, thanks anyway
15:56  MrNibbles: hey guys, is there an equivalent of translate3d in ff 4?
15:56  MrNibbles: and are these transforms hardware accelerated!
15:57  MrNibbles: in webkit i can do: var rotationStyle = 'translate3d(' + bodyLeft + 'px,' + bodyRight + 'px,0px)' + ' rotate(' + (b2body.GetAngle() * 57.2957795) + 'deg)';
15:57  MrNibbles: to get hardware accelerated drawing
15:57  MrNibbles: its maaasively speeding up my game
15:57  MrNibbles: is there a FF4 equivalent?
15:57  MrNibbles: currently using translate(
15:58 @kbrosnan: in canvas i take it?
15:58  MrNibbles: nope, css3
15:59  MrNibbles: canvas is slow ;)
16:02 @kbrosnan: don't see anything in bugzilla covering that
16:03  MrNibbles: the canvas comment or the 3d translation?
16:03 @kbrosnan: the latter
16:03  MrNibbles: ok
16:03 @kbrosnan: is it in the css3 spec yet?
16:04 @kbrosnan: all google turns up is the safari reference and then blogspam
16:04  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-3d-transforms/#transform-functions
16:04  MrNibbles: translate3d <<
16:05  MrNibbles: acutlaly i could possibly get away with matrix3d
16:06  MrNibbles: but it doesnt appear to be in ff4 either at the moment
16:06  epoch: i deleted this file manually because it kept locking me out of firefox with its "invalid password", i uninstalled the ticker, then reinstalled it, and now i cant access preferences of the ticker, does anyone know how to manually do this? .mozilla/firefox/qrsycdpy.default/extensions/{cdd4ec87-8e25-4b42-b8fb-484fdd6a2131}/chrome/cpaleadticker.jar
16:07  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: it actually doesnt make a difference if its not hardware accelerated yet
16:07  MrNibbles: youll notice in my paste i am keeping the z at 9
16:07  MrNibbles: z at 0*
16:07  MrNibbles: in webkit this causes the redraw to be handled in hardware
16:10 @kbrosnan: MrNibbles: found the bug it is open atm
16:10  MrNibbles: gotta link?
16:11 @kbrosnan: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505115
16:12 @kbrosnan: epoch: i don't see any support links on that extensions addon.mozilla.org page. my only suggestion would be to uninstall that extension
16:12 @kbrosnan: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13751/
16:12  MrNibbles: kbrosnan: damn, so implementation has yet to begin?
16:12  epoch: kbrosnan, i think ive got it, i right clicked on the ticker itself and it gave me an option to change the password
16:13  epoch: thanks anyhow though - happy turkey day ;)
