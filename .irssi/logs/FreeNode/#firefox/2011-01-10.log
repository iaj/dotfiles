01:13  RobotCow: How can i get firefox to handle matroska (*.mkv) files the same as it does all other videos it plays embedded?
02:40 --- Pilif12p is now known as [Pilif12p]
03:07  ivan: mkv allows switching languages and subtitles and probably other things
03:07  ivan: what makes you think firefox can support all that stuff? :)
03:08  zoke: chrome can connect to a server that I am running on localhost but firefox cannot. What is going wrong?
03:08  ivan: maybe your firefox is configured to use a proxy?
03:09 --- [Pilif12p] is now known as Pilif12p
03:11  zoke: I set it to "no proxy" in the network settings
03:31  zoke: does anyone have an idea?
04:07  Ademan: noscript users: do you block or allow quantserve.com ? (or specifically edge.quantserve.com)
04:08  pcard: Ademan: yes, though with ab+
04:09  pcard: I use QuickJava when I want to turn off JavaScript (or Java, Flash, SL [if I had it], CSS, Images)
04:09  Ademan: pcard: so you block it?
04:10  pcard: yes
04:11  pcard: (I find QuickJava's buttons in in the bottom-right of the Firefox window is rather intuitive and simple to toggle what you want and don't want downloading at any given time)
04:11  pcard: Last time I looked at noscript, it only was able to toggle JavaScript and it wasn't as simple to goggle it
04:13  pcard: Ademan: yes I block it, it's nothing of use, just another needless (and arguably dangerous) extral ad-site that slow down page load times.
04:22  pcard: is just as bad as the lieks of doubleclick and such
04:23  pcard: it is*
04:23  pcard: (that was a statement, not a question)
04:23  pcard: and I block the whole base domain
04:25  szr: indeed, quantserv is a data mining site, and one of the nastier ones, if only everyone would block it...
04:25  pcard: yes

04:59 @Peng: What makes Quantcast so evil?
05:01  pcard: Peng: are you seriously asking that?
05:01 @Peng: Yes.
05:01 @Peng: szr is of the opinion that it's "nastier" than the average analytics service. I am curious why.
05:02  szr: I said "one of", and not "nastier than"
05:02  pcard: well, I guess Firefox really has become as popular as they say, attacts all kinds :)
05:03 @Peng: "one of the nastier" is another way of saying "nastier than average".
05:03 @Peng: pcard: "all kinds" as in people who don't know the particulars about Quantcast, whatever their opinion on analytics in general?
05:03  pcard: I rank it as one of the worst ones actually, as it has a pretty bad rep for slowing down a site's load time a lot of the time and what they do with what they collect is yet another problem, but seriously, there is just no reason not to bar crap like this from being downloaded
05:04  pcard: Peng: no I didn't mean it that way
05:04 @Peng: pcard: Sure there is: Laziness! :D
05:05  pcard: Peng: just meant people who aren't in the know about everything, as in general average users (a la office denziens who aren't very tech-savy, for example -- not saying /you/ are as such, but generalizing a little)
05:05  pcard: Peng: har har, but seriously, you wouldn't something latch onto your car as you drive and slow it down
05:06  pcard: and that something has a transmitter that let's it's creator know where it's been, etc
05:06  pcard: that comparison may seem a little extreme, but that's basically what happens in a browser that allows that crap to run
05:07 @Peng: pcard: Interesting that you say Quantcast is one of the slower ones.
05:08  pcard: especially when most of these sites are not simply dropping cookies, but running javascript code which is even worse
05:08 @Peng: Also interesting that they make their statistics public -- http://www.quantcast.com/wordpress.com
05:08  pcard: Peng: from what I've seen, it is or at least was one of the slowest, all I know is after blocking it and several others my web surfing is generally much much faster on all the many sites that use them
05:09  pcard: Peng: they only make public what they want ot make public, please don't be naive :)
05:09  pcard: brb
05:10 @Peng: pcard: Good point, but that's still cooler than making *nothing* public.
05:10  geeknik: Quantcast isn't any worse than Google Analytics.
05:10  geeknik: Or Webtrends.
05:11  geeknik: Or worse than the information your ISP has on you that they sell to the highest bidder. ;)
05:13 @Peng: Quantcast does have a kinda clumsy name, though. So they're a *little* bit worse. :P
05:13 * geeknik chuckles.
05:24  geeknik: crash crash crash.
05:24 * geeknik loves Minefield.
05:27  geeknik: randomly crashes when i type in a url - http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/3ee7c68e-e58c-4fcf-9e8c-10fd62110109
05:34 --- Pilif12p is now known as [Pilif12p]
05:54  pcard: Peng: back. But what you don't seem to understand is that even what they make public is no guarentee that it matches up /at all/ with reality. They could publish anything they want, it could be completely fabricated or alterated to make them apepar all good-good
05:54 @Peng: pcard: In what way could the statistics look not "good-good"?
05:54  pcard: Peng: point being, we have no way of knowing anything they say is true or verifying anything they publish. If they were doing something really bad/evil, I seriously doubt they'd announce that to the public.
05:55  pcard: Peng: how they gather it, what they record (basically depending on what all the java-script code is doing), who they sell it too, etc
05:56  pcard: frankly, why I'm not thrilled about beign tracked, in the end, it's the lag it adds to page load times, in Firefox 3.6.13, on a 20+ mbps connection, to me is inexcusable
05:56 @Peng: Yeah, but...how do misleading statistics from some analytics provider hurt anyone but their customers? Aside from those "Firefox is the most popular browser in Europe" stories?
05:57  pcard: again, it depends on what they record and how they use it
05:58 @Peng: Does it really add much "lag"? Most websites load analytics last. It takes longer for the status bar to say "Done", but the page works otherwise.
05:58  pcard: if it were to to, say, via javascript (ajax perhaps?) access info you have stored in a user account/profile on some site and then sells that info, I doubt you'd like that
05:58 @Peng: 'side from the DOM ready event, I s'pose
05:58 @Peng: pcard: I would not like that. And I would be totally pissed at that website for using such a shoddy analytics service.
05:58 @Peng: pcard: Third-party JavaScript is a pervasive security risk.
05:59 * geeknik uses squid to block all of that crap here, so it's all pretty much a non issue for me. =)
05:59  pcard: I've not had the time to take a look at all the Javascript coming from their site (and adblock+ showed at least a dozen separate extrnal javascript calls in any page I've founded that uses *.quantserv.com),
06:00  pcard: there is a lot and if all they wanted to know is what pages I access on a given site they track from, then all they need is a cookie, so why all the javascript
06:01  pcard: or their "tracking pixel" would be enough, as all that gives up is the HTTP_REFERER
06:03  pcard: Peng: but what concerns me is, is what the hell is all that javascript from not only quantserv but others as well actually doing. Sites running blog engine xyz or forum abc (like vbulletin or ipb or phpbb or other), many of which have user profiles that can be accessed via ajax type calls when setup by the site they are adtertising on, so who knows what they are getting, storing, and selling
06:04  pcard: Peng: so it is a real issue, and not just a matter of cookies, which imho is not a real threat
06:05  pcard: (other than for tracking pings of what sites you visit)
06:05  pcard: either way, it's best to blog 'em

08:02  gunsofbrixton: hi, is this the place to ask thunderbird related questions?
08:02 * Peng points to topic
08:04  gunsofbrixton: ok so problem is the password of the exchange server I connect to has expired, is there a way to set a net password via thunderbird?
08:04  gunsofbrixton: apparently outlook would have popped up some dialog asking for a new password
08:05 @Peng: "ok so"? That's not what I meant. At all. The topic specifically mentions Thunderbird's channel.
08:08  gunsofbrixton: Peng: #thunderbird is empty, so where should I ask?
08:10 @Peng: 07:10:29 -!- Topic for #firefox: Mozilla Firefox community support on Freenode | For other Mozilla software, or if no one is active, go to: irc.mozilla.org  #firefox #thunderbird #chatzilla and more | http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Basic+Troubleshooting | Paste at http://pastebin.mozilla.org/ | Firefox  3.6.13 released http://getfirefox.com/
08:11 @Peng: gunsofbrixton: The topic says to go to irc.mozilla.org, not here.
08:12  gunsofbrixton: Peng: ok thanks
08:12 @Peng: ...............................
08:13 @Peng: WTF.
08:13 @Peng: Didn't know what a topic is, I guess?

14:34  Bartzy: I can't update my firefox for some reason?
14:34  Bartzy: It lets me update until 3.6.4
14:36  geeknik: can you just not download the 3.6.13 intaller from http://getfirefox.com/?
15:13  doc-saintly: exit
15:43  UnderSampled: Is there an add-on that will have the browser beep when a page is reloaded because of a javascript?
15:45  ancientt: is there a specific channel for firefox beta?
15:48 @kbrosnan: ancientt: no
15:49 @kbrosnan: UnderSampled: i don't know far too many extension to keep track of these days
16:02  ancientt: I just bumped up to ff beta 4.8 on my main workstation, discovered the status bar disappearance, see there is an addon, was wondering if somebody has more experience, a lot of times i want to see the end of the target url, not the beginning, is there a way to do that?
16:05 @kbrosnan: the address bar display should be http://www.example.com/foo/.../longURL.html
16:06 @kbrosnan: ancientt: for long addresses
16:20  UnderSampled: is there an about:config setting that gives refreshes a click sound (like in IE)?
17:08  UnderSampled: If there are none, what would be required to make a plugin for firefox that causes a sound opon reloading a page
17:09  UnderSampled: if possible, only when it was caused by a javascript?\
17:11 @kbrosnan: there may be something but like i said a few hours ago far too many extensions for people to keep track of.
17:12 @kbrosnan: it should be possible if you are familar with javasscript programming
17:12 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions
17:13 @kbrosnan: a google site specific search may turn something up, http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aaddons.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2F+search+terms

18:42 * Emile trying to figure out why his mac is so sluggish ... found firefox is hogging nearly 1 G of memory, so I closed it, and now it's still showing up as hogging *more* than 1G of memory :P
18:42  Emile: anybody know if that's normal?
18:42  Emile: (I don't think it's Firefox per se, I suspect it's one of the extensions)
18:43  Emile: Ah, he finally managed to close, now my machine is much more responsive :)
18:47  Emile: After rebooting firefox I'm back to a much more reasonable 80 Mo ... and my machine isn't as sluggish! Yay!

22:30  iszak: Does Firefox load the index page of a site like Google Chrome even if you're not on the index page?
22:40 @kbrosnan: what do you mean by not on the index page?
22:41  iszak: e.g. /some/other/path
22:42 @kbrosnan: index.html should be loaded unless the URI specified a page or the server has a different default configured
22:43  iszak: I don't think you understand.
22:44 @kbrosnan: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex
22:45 @kbrosnan: if you are talking about something else be more specific
22:54  iszak: something more specific.
22:54  iszak: basically when I go to say http://www.domain.tld/some/page google chrome also loads the index in anticipation you're going to hit it
22:56  pcard: anyone know what the equivilent of  firefox -profile "/path/to/profile/foo" is for Firefox 1.5 ? It works for 2.x and 3.x but doesn't seem to work for 1.5(.0.12), it just starts Firefox and opens that profile path in a tab
23:01 @kbrosnan: iszak: this is a request for a page without index.html http://pastebin.mozilla.org/922077
23:02 @kbrosnan: pcard: not possible. is there a reason you need to run such an old version of firefox, it makes up an very small percentage of Firefox users
23:02  iszak: kbrosnan, don't worry you don't understand.
23:02  iszak: thanks anyway.
23:03 @kbrosnan: iszak: if firefox was requesting the file then it would show up in the gets firefox makes
23:03  pcard: kbrosnan: what do you mean not possible? I keep 1.5 and 2.0 around for testing, I need to be able test the corporate web-site for the client I work for in various browsers, for Firefox 1.x-4.x
23:04 @kbrosnan: iszak: unless the link to the site specifies the prefetch attribute https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ
23:05 @kbrosnan: pcard: it was not implemented in Firefox 1.5, you'll need to use the profile manager directly
23:05  pcard: I use 3.6.13 as my main browser, and I find in 2.x I can get it to launch (while having 3.6.13 still be the default url/link handler) independantly by using ...firefox.exe -no-remote -profile "..." and -P Test about:blank
23:05  pcard: (this is on Windows btw)
23:05  geeknik: weird. chrome 10.0.628.0 dev doesn't prefetch/preload index.html or index.php or index anything when I load random web pages.
23:05 @kbrosnan: though I am rather supprised that you get enough traffic from pre 2.0 clients to make that worth your tiem
23:06  pcard: kbrosnan: ah
23:06  pcard: kbrosnan: on a side note, how do you see all the available command line args a firefox.exe can take? --help, -help, -?  don't work
23:07  pcard: kbrosnan: no, I'm required to test in all those browsers, because people in that comany use it and they need to be sure it works everywhere
23:07 @kbrosnan: hate to say it but blind testing.
23:08  pcard: I didn't make the site, and whoever did is the type of person who likes to go a little ajax-happy... it barely works in IE6 (as if I'd care, cept I'm told some people in the company refuse to give it up too)
23:08  pcard: kbrosnan: on a side note, how do you see all the available command line args a firefox.exe can take? --help, -help, -?  don't work
23:13 @kbrosnan: geeknik: example of a prefetch request, http://pastebin.mozilla.org/922112
23:14  geeknik: yes, i know all about that stuff. i was just pointing out that my copy of chrome wasn't prefetching anything like was mentioned.
23:15  geeknik: doesn't matter to me one way or the other to be honest. =)
23:40  pcard: quick question, how does one determine what profile is currently loaded in a firefox instance?
23:56  Thell: Hello all!  Got a question re: 'Open Containing Folder'.  Is it now possible to define the file manager within FF?  Or is there a plugin offerring this ability?
23:57  Thell: I've seen quite a few bugs in the tracker for File Manager assignment issues, but none actually stated if there was an actual fix from within FF
23:57 @kbrosnan: it uses the gtk file browser nautilus
23:58  Thell: Does that mean it is not 'settable' as of yet?  ie: about:config <some magical key:val>
23:59  Thell: I just recently found a plugin that adds a 'copy file location' context menu entry to the file manager, so perhaps I can script something. :/
