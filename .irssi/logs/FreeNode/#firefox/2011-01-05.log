00:11  geeknik: Is Bugzilla down? "The connection to bugzilla.mozilla.org was interrupted while the page was loading."
00:20  manizzle: is there any firefox addon that will keep refreshing the page every second till some user limited threshold until a full page is loaded and not a "not found" page,
00:22  geeknik: manizzle: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/115/
00:22  geeknik: although i think it will keep reloading even if the page is loaded.
00:23  manizzle: ugh, not exactly what i want
00:23  manizzle: like my internet connection SEEMS fine, but sometimes when i load a page ff says it cant find the page, then i just spam f5 till it works
00:24  geeknik: manizzle: depending on what version of FF you're using, there is an open bug for this issue.
00:24  manizzle: im using the ff 4 beta
00:24  manizzle: 4.0b7
00:24  geeknik: I don't think it's fixed yet, so even upgrading to b8 won't help.
00:25  geeknik: You might try Fierr. It will reload error pages every 10 seconds. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5754/
00:25  geeknik: I can't get to bugzilla, so I can't pull up the bug #.
00:25  manizzle: oh so its a open bug?
00:25 * geeknik nods.
00:26  geeknik: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2462/ is another extension to try.

00:29  manizzle: thank god, i thought i was going crazy
00:30  geeknik: i haven't seen the bug, but some people are seeing it.
00:30  manizzle: oh
00:30  manizzle: its rampant on my machine
00:31  manizzle: thank god, i was gonna write some addon for it
00:32  StyXman: any add-on that lets me save all the data downloaded while displaying a page? I susupect that some js code is setting a cookie that is not set by any of the responses of the contents downloaded (I already checked with data tamper)
00:34  geeknik: StyXman: you could always use something like http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/
00:34  geeknik: i use it to hunt for vulnerabilities on sites and other things.
00:35  manizzle: geeknik, i use burp-proxy
00:35  Aperculum: I wish there was a firefox plugin
00:35  StyXman: I see, nice idea
00:35  geeknik: Aperculum: firefox plugin for?
00:37  StyXman: data tamper is so close...
00:53  StyXman: geeknik: FTR, I'm using wwwoffle under Linux and works like a charm :)
00:54  geeknik: cool, i'll check it out.
00:54  mtx_init: If you disable disk write ability and disable cookies, but add a cookie exception, where is that cookie stored?
00:54  StyXman: mtx_init: memory?
00:54  mtx_init: StyXman: they persist shutdown
00:55  StyXman: sorry, that's were it *can* be stored, but I don't know at all if ffox caches cookies
00:55  StyXman: mtx_init: so you don't have page cache either?
00:56  mtx_init: what do you mean by that?
00:56  StyXman: mtx_init: js code can set cookies
00:56  StyXman: if the code is cached, then the cookie is set when the code is executed
00:57  mtx_init: I don't think it has anything to do with js, it
00:57  StyXman: that's exactly what I'm debugging right now :)
00:57  mtx_init: 's just a basic FF functionality works the same on any site
00:57  StyXman: ah, ok
02:04  Lxndr: I have Firefox installed on multiple computers. On each computer I have the exact same Greasemonkey scripts installed. On one computer, they all work. On this computer, only half of them work. What can I do to make them all work?

10:56  kateweb: eventualy
11:07  jonasb: kateweb: thanks :-)  got some replies over at irc.moz. apparently not worked on actively
11:07  kateweb: :(
11:08  kateweb: i guess you could take up the casue
11:28  jonasb: I think it's just a matter of time... it's not in for FF4 but I guess it will be there... eventually :-)
11:29  kateweb: yeah but if you could get that working you would be a multi touch god
11:34  jonasb: :-)

14:40  katsrc: hello
14:41  katsrc: i was wondering why are Firefox packages from Mozilla site compiled with so little configuration arguments vs distro integrated versions of Firefox in GNU/Linux?
14:42 @kbrosnan: because firefox can't assume the needed versions of packages are present
14:42 @kbrosnan: it also provides a solid baseline to compare distro tweaked builds against
14:43  katsrc: so it's just built with very vanilla configs
14:43  katsrc: they should actually customize it more for popular distros
14:43 @kbrosnan: not a good investment of resources
14:45 @kbrosnan: so many users get firefox from their distro that linux builds are rarely downloaded from mozilla
14:45  katsrc: i keep on having to build it from scratch every time there is a beta or security update
14:46  katsrc: just because the distros take some time to put it together
14:46  katsrc: but it makes sense from mozilla's stand point
14:48  katsrc: kbrosnan: thanks for your input
14:49  djszapi: What the fuck ?
14:49  djszapi: I try to print a page into a file in firefox and the target pdf is unreadable....
14:49  djszapi: works like a charm in other browsers.
14:49 @kbrosnan: katsrc: what version of firefox are you downloading? 3.6 4.0?
14:49  djszapi: How can I fix it asap ?
14:50  katsrc: kbrosnan: Firefox 4 Beta 8
14:51 @kbrosnan: djszapi: what page? I just checked a page on windows and it printed fine
14:51  djszapi: kbrosnan: any page.
14:52 @kbrosnan: katsrc: mozilla does produce x64 builds, they are just not advertized http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/4.0b8/linux-x86_64/
14:52 @kbrosnan: djszapi: os?
14:52  djszapi: kbrosnan: linux
14:53 @kbrosnan: djszapi: Firefox verison?
14:53  djszapi: 3.6.12
14:55  djszapi: I think I do not need to say how annoying this is :)
14:56  djszapi: any idea ???
14:57 @kbrosnan: i'm checking my ubunutu 10.10 vm currently
14:59  djszapi: I do not think it helps if it works by you.
14:59  djszapi: the problem is gonna still exist
15:00  djszapi: is it a default settings issue ?
15:01 @kbrosnan: i've not run into it myself or seen someone come in with that issue before today
15:01  djszapi: well I can send you the final pdf file.
15:01  djszapi: if you would like to check the result out.
15:02 @kbrosnan: I am able to print a page from cnn.com and a hindi bbc.co.uk. Do you have the gnome printing libraries instaled?
15:02  djszapi: I do not have any gnome installed.
15:02  djszapi: I use ratpoison, maybe in the "background"
15:03  djszapi: if you give me more accurate details about your question, I can check that out.
15:03 @kbrosnan: libgnomeprint i think
15:04  djszapi: most likely not
15:04  djszapi: there is no such a package.
15:04  djszapi: no idea why I should install gnome on a non-gnome system tho.
15:05  djszapi: seems an unneccesary activity.
15:06  djszapi: time and space consuming.
15:07  djszapi: but tried, did not solve
15:11  djszapi: firefox sucks :)
15:11 @kbrosnan: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/widget/src/gtk2/nsPrintDialogGTK.cpp
15:12  djszapi: well the only solution is to remove mozilla firefox then
15:12  djszapi: I will not spend my whole work hours with a small printing bug.
15:12 @kbrosnan: so be it
15:12  djszapi: too bad it cannot print anything into a file.
