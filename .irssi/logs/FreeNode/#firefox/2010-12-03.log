15:59  I440r: can anyone here tell me of an addon that kills these ANNOYING mouse over popups?
15:59  I440r: adblock+ does not block them
16:05 @kbrosnan: noscript
16:05 @kbrosnan: though I use a dns based null route
16:06  I440r: noscript is horribe
16:06  I440r: whats worse getting a single popup or having to click 2865429346594 different things to enable the one thing you do want
16:06  I440r: and these are NOT javascript
16:06  I440r: disable javascript totally and they still popup
16:06 @kbrosnan: I don't disagree with that assement
16:07  I440r: this is a deliberate marketing ploy by firefox devs
16:07  I440r: whoring themselves out to the add companies basically
16:07 @kbrosnan: no
16:07  I440r: yes
16:07 @kbrosnan: the only pop ups that are blocked are physical windows
16:08  I440r: which is a complete and utter COP out.  if i dont want popups i dont want ANY popups
16:08 @kbrosnan: anything that the website chooses to do inside their own content page is their choice
16:08  I440r: also. the built in popup blocker is major fail at blocking popups
16:09  I440r: i can show you a page where if you click on a link not only do you go to where the link is meant to take you, you also get a popup
16:09 @kbrosnan: there are classes of popups that are whitelisted. if you want to clear the whitelist i can explain how to do that
16:09  I440r: i did clear it
16:09  I440r: my exceptions list is blank
16:10  I440r: theres NO reason why these double underline mouse over popups even WORK
16:10  I440r: the fact that they exist is only possob;e becaise FF devs PUT them in there for the add companies
16:11  I440r: i have disabled popups. i have erased my white list. i have disabled tooltips
16:11 @kbrosnan: like i said those are not popups they are content that the website desinger has chosen to include in their page
16:11  I440r: they ARE popups
16:11  I440r: you can rationalize them into what ever category you want to but they are still popups
16:11  I440r: and they are ADVERTS.
16:11 @kbrosnan: firefox would be lynched if they started removing code from websites
16:12  I440r: dont remove code from web sites. remove the code inside firefox
16:12 @kbrosnan: Firefox's job is to display the site as the author intented
16:12 @kbrosnan: you can't they are using standard html to show the mousover adverts
16:13 @kbrosnan: they are usually floating divs
16:13  I440r: then i want to disable mouse over ENTIRELY wihtin the browser
16:13 @kbrosnan: removing divs from firefox would break the web
16:13  I440r: they are not floating divs
16:13 @kbrosnan: or iframes w/e they are web content
16:13  I440r: how do i KILL mouse over
16:13  I440r: i want NO mouse over effects at all.
16:14 @kbrosnan: learn c and edit spidermonkey, recompile firefox
16:14 @kbrosnan: use mobile firefox?
16:18  lover: I'm experiencing a wierd behaviour, sometimes (seems random) clicking with the mouse on a tab doesn't activate the tab but it closes it. This is really annoying as you understand, but how can I change it? what is wrong?
16:18  I440r: its not html
16:18  I440r: i just looked at the source of a page containing it
16:19  I440r: a paragraph will contain something like <!-- google_ad_section_start --> and <!-- google_ad_section_end -->
16:19  I440r: anywhere in between those to marks one word will be given a double underscore and will be a link
16:19  I440r: this is NOT done inside the web page its done inside firefox
16:20 @kbrosnan: you are incorect
16:20 --- Copia_de_sud0 is now known as sud0
16:20  I440r: these adverts are not javascript and they are not html
16:21  I440r: the comments are being interpreted inside FF
16:21 @kbrosnan: no they are not
16:21 @kbrosnan: give me a link to such a page.
16:21  I440r: fox news.com uses them alot
16:22 @kbrosnan: lover: the only way to close a tab by defaut with the mouse should be middle clicking
16:23  I440r: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/02/finger-flipping-crosswalk-sign-fixed/?test=latestnews
16:23  lover: kbrosnan: then it seems like Firefox or maybe my window maker maps my mouse wrongly at random occasions. Have you heard anyone else experience this?
16:23  I440r: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/12/02/obama-gains-ground-push-nuclear-treaty/?test=latestnews
16:27 @kbrosnan: I440r: that double unnderlined text is created by this company http://www.kontera.com/
16:27 @kbrosnan: specifically this bit of javascript http://kona.kontera.com/javascript/lib/KonaLibInline.js
16:28 @kbrosnan: http://kb.kontera.com/questions/92/How+do+I+implement+the+Kontera+tag+on+my+site%3F
16:28 @kbrosnan: lover: are you right clicking on the tabs when that happens?
16:29 @kbrosnan: lover: some linux wm will interpet a right and left click at the same time as a middle click
16:29  I440r: then why does adblock+ not block this popup when i add that url to its filters
16:30  I440r: and thats just one source. i want to kill ALL popups of this type no matter WHERE they come from
16:31  I440r: how do i disable all mouse overs?
16:32 @kbrosnan: No idea I don't use abp, ask about blocking kontera ads at https://adblockplus.org/forum/
16:33  I440r: they are just one source. the only way to kill these is to kill mouse overs
16:35  lover: kbrosnan: no I left click
16:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o gavin_]
16:38  I440r: kbrosnan, are you a FF dev?
16:41  I440r: it would take me years to find the exact code i need ti PURGE from these sources to get rid of ALL mouse over effects in firefox
16:41  I440r: "to"
16:44 @kbrosnan: Your options are 1) vote with your feet and use a site that does not use such ads 2) contact the site developer tell them how the ads are disruptive 3) ask the adblock people how do block such ads 4) re-code and re-compile Firefox with the features you want
18:19  Compn: anyone know of an option to stop/unrender/clear background tabs until they are clicked/active? to free up ram / cpu etc
18:19 @kbrosnan: bartab
18:21  Compn: thx

20:33  eueu: Hello! I am trying to generate a PDF file from a web page that is displayed on my computer, but I would like to be able to setup page breaks beforehand. Actually my best choice is exporting it to, say, OpenOffice.org and make PDF from there, but OpenOffice.org won't apply my default stylesheet nor included stylesheets
20:33  eueu: Do you have a way to do that?
20:34  eueu: BTW I am working on Linux, but if needed I can boot on Vista
21:09  sedulous: eueu: my best would be to save the whole page and edit the sources
21:10  sedulous: IIRC CSS has some options specifically for printers, possibly pagebreaks too

21:33  gauz: how will i go about it?>
21:42  sherl0ck: can somone suggest a well written  firefox extension, that has good format, that i can reference?
21:44  eueu: sedulous, seems there is some CSS rule ( page-break-inside: avoid; ) that could be of interest to me, but only Opera supports it.
21:45  eueu: Maybe I am going to use a PDF printer with Opera.

22:15  Lars_G: Is there a way, or is it a good idea, to be able to save the contents of a window group in FF4 and unload them (having the option to reload it) as to save some memory ussage?
22:37  auscompgeek: Lars_G: you can save it to disk I guess
22:37  auscompgeek: kateweb: that involves a complicated process of finding your Firefox profile folder and deleting persdict.dat
22:37  kateweb: ok i know ware that file is
22:52  puff: I have firefox with session manager.  I quit & savd my session with a zillion tabs.  I'm on a very limited bandwidth connection, I'd like to open firefox without opening my entire session, and then load just one of the windows from my old session.
22:52  puff: Is this possible?
23:12  auscompgeek: The Session Manager add-on?
23:13  auscompgeek: If you set it up to ask before trying to load any tabs, yes.
23:13  auscompgeek: If not, it'll be a bit complex, but doable.
23:24  ar0nic: for some reason which ive never seen firefox is now splittign my pages down the middle
23:24  ar0nic: instead of opening each ina new tab
23:24  ar0nic: this some sort of feature in beta 4 ?
23:25  ar0nic: everytiem i open a new tab, it will pull the tab b4 it up and split the two down the screen
23:25  ar0nic: to i guess compare or something?
23:26  ar0nic: wait i am sorry its just my bookmarks that does this.
23:27  ar0nic: i guess it is automatically opening each bookmark in a new seperator? anyone nkow how to turn this off
23:34  auscompgeek: Er, it's not even possible even with Firefox 4...
23:38  ar0nic: well it did it
23:38  ar0nic: its not now
23:38  ar0nic: but for some reason if i dont right click a bookmark, and choose open in new tab it auto seperates

23:45  auscompgeek: only explanation
