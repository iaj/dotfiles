11:05  gryllida: set browser.dom.window.dump.enabled to true in about:config and then start firefox from terminal
11:05  kashyapc: I'll see the logging on the terminal?

11:41  vigge_sWe: hi
11:41  vigge_sWe: I am getting this error whenever I try to install adblock+: http://pastebin.com/5Kqp3Tff
11:41  vigge_sWe: any ideas?
11:43  Cork: might be a proxy problem
11:43  vigge_sWe: nvm fixed it by downloading the xpi to my hdd (using save as) and running it from there
11:43  Stummi: i got this problem too today while updating it
11:52  Uresu: Hi all, does anyone know if there is a built in right-click menu supressing key.   So that if a wenbsite wants to display a right click menu I can right click without FF's menu appearing too!
11:54  Uresu: A toggle key, like ctrl click rather than disabling/renabling in options.

13:26  sromah: Hi everyone. I got problem with downloading the link from firefox. I am using firefox 3.6.12 on Mac. When i download a link, say http://website.com/filename.doc or something, the popup window is not showing anymore. I have to use "save link as.." from right click menu. Does anyone know how to fix it?
13:56 @kbrosnan: sromah: what happens if you click on the doc link?
14:08  sromah: kbrosnan: sorry for late reply. It opens new blank tab and nothing happen.
14:14 @kbrosnan: sromah: would you test the behavior in Firefox's safe mode, http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode
14:14  sromah: kbrosnan: thanks.. let me test it
14:20  sromah: kbrosnan: It is the same. Nothing happen. It jumps to the new blank tab and seem like trying to download. Nothing happen. I tested with Opera, Safari the save dialog box open. Here is the url that i am testing it. http://www.getwifisync.com/mac/uninstall.zip
14:20 @kbrosnan: if you check the download manager does the file show up?
14:21 @kbrosnan: tools > downloads
14:21  sromah: No. It didn't show up.
14:23 @kbrosnan: sromah: how about a new profile
14:23 @kbrosnan: https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing+profiles
14:24  sromah: kbrosnan: thanks for your help. Let me try it. :)
14:30  sromah: kbrosnan: I created new profile for firefox and there is no luck. :( I screenprint my browser. http://img560.imageshack.us/img560/7554/screenshot20101104at122.png
14:31 @kbrosnan: that makes it look like firefox is having trouble connecting to that site
14:32  sromah: But when i chose the option from right click "Save as link..", Firefox downloads straight away.
14:35  sromah: if you download from Mediafire or Rapidshare os some kind of free file hosting sites, the download dialog box appears. It doesn't appear only when you download static files from the web pages.
14:39  sromah: kbrosnan: i have to say thanks for you time. :) even though, my problem is not solved it yet. I learned a lot from you like Safe mode and making new profiles.
14:39  sromah: I am heading off now. See you around.. Thanks again for your time and help.. bye
14:40 @kbrosnan: good luck

17:08  catphish: can anyone tell me how long firefox caches content by default?
17:13  FuchurX: Hello. I have a problem with Firefox and plugins, especially the Java plugin. I have Ubuntu 64bit and I want to install Firefox 32bit with Java 32bit plugin (because the Java 64bit-plugin doesn't work correctly with many older Java-based admin interfaces).
17:13  catphish: in response to my own question - its based on how old the content is already - clever :)
17:14  FuchurX: So I installed Firefox32 and Java32. But now even when I am starting Firefox 32 it tries to load the 64bit plugins.
17:15  FuchurX: How do I say to firefox where it should look for plugins?=
17:19  FuchurX: I wonder how firefox knows where to look for plugins ... (it is distribution specific, isn't it?)
17:28  a7x: oh hi :)

17:58  sha1sum: Hey all. I'm wanting to deploy a cross-platform video training DVD. There's an existing website with flash videos for a client of mine, and I'll basically be mirroring that on a DVD. I was wondering if there is a way to include a portable version of Prism for *nix, Windows, and Mac with Flash plugins already installed?
17:59  sha1sum: *nix isn't as important as Window and Mac because their clientele aren't going to be very *nix-heavy at all
17:59  sha1sum: +s
18:12 @kbrosnan: sha1sum: i think you will run into issues running content locally. without a web server you will get unexpected results
18:12  sha1sum: kbrosnan: even with relative URLs?
18:13  sha1sum: all HTML, images, and .swf files will be local on the disc
18:13  sha1sum: and there will be a page that parses the last 5 podcast entries from RSS given an internet connection, but that's a separate matter.
