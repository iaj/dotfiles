17:23  qknight: i have a page opened with a .ogv video. however, if i click 'download' it downloads the video yet another time. that seems to be normal in firefox but isn't there any other way? it's about 600mb
17:23  qknight: and the ogv is already downloaded, i can watch it
17:24  steffen123__: qknight: as a workaround, you should be able to find the file in the temp directory or firefox' cache
17:24  steffen123__: not necessarily under the correct filename tho
17:25  qknight: i've already tried lsof but i couldn't locate it
17:25  qknight: maybe i can use 'locate'
17:25  qknight: thanks for that idea
17:26  qknight:  /tmp has 500kb of files. and .mozilla does have 2mb
17:26  qknight: so where could that file be?
17:27  qknight: no can't find it
17:27  qknight: so then let's download it again
17:27  qknight: i really don't understand that design?!!
17:27  qknight: steffen123__: thanks anyway
