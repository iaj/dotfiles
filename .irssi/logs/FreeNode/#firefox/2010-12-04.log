14:18  jMCg: I'm using Firefox as my primary email client. That is, with the Zimbra Web Client. I'm looking for a possibility to do the following: When composing an email, I'd like to be able to format it. That is: I want it to highlight or break lines longer than 69 characters.
15:31  Cursarion: jMCg: is the Zimbra Web Client a website or a plugin/program?
15:32  jMCg: Cursarion: a website.
15:33  Cursarion: sounds like their job
15:33  jMCg: It is Ajaxi and all, but that is beside the point. I am looking for a plugin (or whatever) that will work on all text fields. (Also I am looking for an apastrophe)
