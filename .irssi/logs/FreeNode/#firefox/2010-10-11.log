14:31  ericthehax: I got to ask: why? Why does firefox 4 have a single menu button like all the crappy microsoft and autodesk software?
14:32  mryanbrown: central location, saves space?
14:32  ericthehax: confuses people who actually have experience with a computer?
14:33  mryanbrown: how is it confusing?
14:33  mryanbrown: it's essentially the same menu layout, just layered under a single menu item
14:33  ericthehax: that's what they all say, then it gets worse
14:34  mryanbrown: how does it get worse
14:34  ericthehax: then they put a ribbon and crap next to it
14:34  ericthehax: and they remove the difference between file, tools, etc
14:35  mryanbrown: so you're speculative arguing?
14:36  ericthehax: maybe... partially. It just gets confusing and painful after getting used to file, edit, view, etc for so many years
14:36  mryanbrown: its still pretty much the same, and things change after 20 years. just happens
14:36  mryanbrown: personally i think it makes the ui more clean and intuitive
14:36  mryanbrown: i hate seeing ui elements i hardly ever use
14:37  ericthehax: well at least you didn't say innovative...
14:37  mryanbrown: microsoft innovated it
14:37  ericthehax: microsoft made a cluster**** with it
14:38  mryanbrown: I don't think so, I think the office 2007 style ui changes were terrible
14:38  mryanbrown: jumplists, tasklists, and the ribbon are handy
14:38  mryanbrown: very time saving, makes ui cleaner
14:39  ericthehax: lol i spoke way too soon: just found out the hard way file, etc are still there >_<
14:39  ericthehax: (alt)
14:39  mryanbrown: shortcuts?
14:39  ericthehax: ?
14:40  mryanbrown: did you use a shortcut to show the menu?
14:40  ericthehax: it gives me the menubar till i use it or click
14:41 * ericthehax fails
15:10  mongag: Hi
15:13  mongag: I`m using firefox 3.6.10 on Mac OS X 10.6.4.  If I browse websites for approximately two hours firefox become very slow. Right now consume 1Gb of RAM
15:14  mongag: Is there a way to fix that ?
15:14  Cork: mongag: you could start by trying with extensions disabled
15:14  Cork: its often caused by extensions
15:15  mryanbrown: i just read a mozillahacks blog post about the new ffox and java/caching
15:15  mryanbrown: *checks history*
15:15  Cork: java/caching
15:15  Cork: you mean javascript/caching
15:15  mryanbrown: yes!
15:15  mryanbrown: how its enabled by default in .10 am i right?
15:15  mryanbrown: that might be it
15:15  mryanbrown: maybe its not clearing
15:16  mongag: Cork: yes I have a lot of extensions enabled
15:16  mryanbrown: or he has too much jscript/windows open
15:16  mryanbrown: i only have java/flash installed in mine, the rest were gutted out
15:19  Cork: well ya, webpages you keep open might cause it too
15:20  Cork: if the javascript doesn't release its variables correctly it can leak memory
15:20  Cork: mryanbrown: btw firefox doesn't support jscript
15:20  Cork: mryanbrown: jscript is microsofts implementation of ecmascript
15:21  mryanbrown: i forget you folks get technical
15:21  mryanbrown: i abbreviate javascript jscript
15:21  mryanbrown: cause really, who uses jscript
15:21  Cork: sadly, alot do
15:21  mryanbrown: terrible
15:21  Cork: and they get in truble cause of it
15:21  mryanbrown: has it even been updated in 8+ years?
15:22  Cork: documents.forms[] and thinkgs like that
15:22  Cork: *things
15:22  Cork: mryanbrown: sure it has
15:22  Cork: its still part of ie8
15:22  Cork: and ie9
15:22  mryanbrown: oh
15:22  mryanbrown: i dont use that trash
15:22  Cork: jscript is what ie uses
15:22  mryanbrown: ie6 is when i stopped liking ie
15:22  Cork: javascript is what opera/webkit/gecko uses
15:23  mryanbrown: no wonder it sucks
15:23  Cork: mryanbrown: ie5.5 was my end
15:23  Cork: nothing happend at that point
15:23  mryanbrown: I miss simple browsers
15:23  mryanbrown: an address bar, buttons, and favorites
15:23  Cork: mryanbrown: you could always grab lynx ;)
15:24  mryanbrown: i use links when i want to browser console-minded websites
15:24  mryanbrown: or websites that aren't busy with crap
15:24  Cork: it has an addressbar, it supports buttons, and favorites
15:24  mryanbrown: i want video support in links/lynx
15:24  mryanbrown: I know it's possible
15:24  mryanbrown: I seen a dvd playback in the console
15:25  Cork: mryanbrown: no you haven't
15:25  mryanbrown: Swear to god I have
15:25  mryanbrown: well not a dvd
15:25  Cork: at least not if it isn't converting the images to test
15:25  mryanbrown: but mpeg2
15:25  mryanbrown: on a 486
15:25  mryanbrown: thats exactly what it did
15:25  mryanbrown: in real time
15:25  mryanbrown: was slightly blocky
15:25  mryanbrown: but you could make stuff out
15:25  Cork: mryanbrown: console by defenition can't show graphics
15:25  Cork: mryanbrown: you could switch the old dos console to graphic mode
15:26  Cork: but you CAN'T show graphics in a normal console
15:26  Cork: its imposible
15:26  mryanbrown: it wasnt real graphics
15:26  mryanbrown: it was colored special characters
15:26  Cork: heh, ya but that sucks...
15:26  mryanbrown: yeah, but it decoded mpeg2 in real time on a 486 in a console
15:26  mryanbrown: thats cool just because it is
15:27  Cork: mryanbrown: if you can throw away over half of the data, its not really that hard
15:28  mryanbrown: -_- I gotta master the webkit/mozilla build environments from scratch in the next 2 days. I want to build a headless xulrunner client by the weekend. idk why mozilla hasnt made a widget engine :/ would be so easy
15:28  Cork: run the movie in 40x40 and you see what i mean :)
15:28  mryanbrown: html5/css3/flash/webgl/webm enabled widgets
15:28  mryanbrown: its the futarz
15:29  Cork: if you remove the flash from there, then ya it is :)
15:29  mryanbrown: flash has its moments
15:29  Cork: its dying
15:29  Cork: slowly
15:29  mryanbrown: the web would have sucked for videos without it, none of the other options were really adopted
15:29  mryanbrown: yeah, but for years it was the defacto
15:29  mryanbrown: i hate when people use it for menus, so much
15:29  Cork: mryanbrown: i'm not talking about history you said _future_ :)
15:30  mryanbrown: ok you got me
15:30  mryanbrown: but still
15:30  mryanbrown: why is there no headless firefox
15:30  Cork: ya, the web would have been alot more boring if flash wasn't there
15:30  mryanbrown: .xpi > .gadget
15:30  Cork: there is
15:30  mryanbrown: there is?
15:31  Cork: depends what language you want it in
15:31  Cork: you can run gecko if you want
15:31  Cork: or use xulrunner (that firefox builds upon)
15:31  mryanbrown: yeah thats what im talking about
15:31  Cork: or there is binarys for including it in .net and so on
15:31  mryanbrown: a barebones xulrunner running transparent windows on the desktop
15:31  mryanbrown: web sites as gadgets, nothing custom
15:32  mryanbrown: just design it like you would to display on a site, and just package it to run locally
15:32  Cork: mryanbrown: thats not xulrunner :)
15:32  Cork: its prisma
15:32  mryanbrown: prisma is an extended xulrunner isnt it
15:32  mryanbrown: prism/prism
15:32  Cork: https://mozillalabs.com/blog/2007/10/prism/
15:32  mryanbrown: prisma*
15:32  mryanbrown: yeah it still has a window
15:32  mryanbrown: dont need a window
15:33  mryanbrown: if i want a menu ill write it in javascript/css and bind it
15:33  mryanbrown: so i was thinking pyqt/webkit/xulrunner
15:33  Cork: mryanbrown: it has a windows border if thats what you mean
15:33  Cork: http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/prism/announcement/googleCalendar550.png
15:33  mryanbrown: thats what I mean
15:33  mryanbrown: I don't want it to run in a window. I want a transparent window just like a gadget
15:33  mryanbrown: transparent window and <body> probably
15:34  Cork: i'm actually not sure to what extend xulrunner supports border less windows
15:34  Cork: that isn't maximized
15:34  mryanbrown: i imagine removing the frame should be relatively easy
15:37  mryanbrown: i was just thinking xulrunner seems like the logical basis for a widget engine
15:37  mryanbrown: its fast, and cross-platform
15:37  mryanbrown: so widgets would work w/o modification across all systems
15:50  mryanbrown: Cork, if you got a min can you once over this for me? http://pastebin.com/pkB2Ddgy just seeing if you know something offhand that could fix this error
15:51  Cork: mryanbrown: i stay way away from building in windows >_>
15:52  mryanbrown: haha :(
15:53  mryanbrown: I wish the webkit channel was more active
15:53  mryanbrown: I'm sure it's something simple I'm just overlooking. been up all night
17:46  Chetic: (Ubuntu 10.04:) firefox froze and, even after a reboot, freezes whenever I start it
17:47  Chetic: no clue how to reset it or whatever
17:48 @kbrosnan: alt + f2
17:48 @kbrosnan: then type firefox -safe-mode
17:48 @kbrosnan: and see if firefox starts Chetic
17:50  Chetic: kbrosnan: still hangs, after displaying the "this is embarrassing" stuff and before I get to press start new session
17:52  Chetic: well I can press the start new session button but it freezes with the button is still pressed
17:54 @kbrosnan: Chetic: sounds like you might have a crash id, http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Mozilla+Crash+Reporter

21:50  Guest4794: Hi there
21:51  Guest4794: When I browse a SVG document that contains arabic text , it shows the characters ltr instead of rtl
21:51  Guest4794: while google chrome renders that page correctly
21:51  Cork[home]: Guest4794: i think you have to specify direction in svg just like in html
21:52  Cork[home]: is this done?
21:52  Guest4794: yes , I did but no effect
21:53  Cork[home]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311545
21:53  Cork[home]: its not implemented yet
21:54  Guest4794: hmm. thanks
21:54  Guest4794: at least I know that's not my fault ;)
21:55  Cork[home]: :)
21:55  Cork[home]: svg is really new in support, and there is still quite a bit left to full support
22:10  Guest4794: Cork[home]: thanks for guidance . bye
