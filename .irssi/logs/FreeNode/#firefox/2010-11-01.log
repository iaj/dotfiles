02:10  linux_stu: awesomebar is not acting very awesome right now
02:10  linux_stu: most of the time, the list of search results never appears when i start typing letters into the awesomebar
02:10  linux_stu: has anyone else experienced this?
02:11  linux_stu: i haven't found a pattern as to when it works and when it doesn't.
02:18  win2000user: linux_stu,
02:18  win2000user: try to check for the issue in safe mode
02:18  linux_stu: ok

05:45  quietone: How to watch a TED talk vid? Both firefox and epiphany only show a blue screen. youtube works, if that matters. Ubuntu 10.04/firefox 3.6.12
06:06  quietone: somebody? I have been searching on and off for a few hours. I am stuck.
07:21  LinuxPhreak: I'm interested in building a firefox for my father. I use Linux and he uses Windows. Could I build a Windows Firefox in Linux? I already downloaded the source code and read up on the tools I'll need
07:23 @gavin: it's possible, in the "anythiing is possible, it's software!" sense
07:23 @gavin: it's not supported and it's significantly more complicated than completing a "normal" build
07:24  LinuxPhreak: Okay so I should build it in Windows to save me the hassle
07:24 @gavin: yeah

07:54  freetown2: hi all, anybody know why firefox is dead set on looking for stuff in some other profile directory other than that in profiles.ini?
07:56  auscompgeek: Hm?
07:59  freetown2: contents of profiles.ini http://firefox.pastebin.com/eG0NLQ5C
08:02  freetown2: logs: http://firefox.pastebin.com/nU11dJrw firefox looking for something with a completely different profile directory

08:06 * auscompgeek always thought the Firefox pastebin was at http://pastebin.mozilla.org
08:09 * ComputerFreak will be back later.
08:09 * freetown2 could care less when he does not know the local pastebin
08:12 * ComputerFreak is using ChatZilla from SeaMonkey - I need not renew it as I do for mIRC :P *Thumbs up*.
08:19  auscompgeek: :D

13:23  ntoll: I'm on Lucid with the packaged Firefox 3.6.8 and I'm playing with CORS requests. I'm calling a HEAD method on a resource (so I only want the headers back) but XHR.getAllResponseHeaders() returns null if the request is CORS (see http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). It works as advertised for a regular same-origin request. Google isn't returning anything particularly useful so just asking here in the hope that someone can explain what's going o
13:23  ntoll: n (i.e. is it a bug or a "feature") TIA
13:24 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Server-Side_Access_Control
13:31  Anomie2: Both my firefox and thunderbird keep crashing on start up - I've tried reinstalling both applications, still crashing...
13:31  Anomie2: crash report: http://pastebin.com/zsRjRQMU
13:32  ntoll: kbrosnan, yeah... that's about CORS in general... and things work just as advertise *BUT* the XHR.getAllResponseHeaders() function doesn't allow me to get at the headers in the response from the server.
13:33  ntoll: unless I'm missing something on that page</couldbeme>
13:34 @kbrosnan: Anomie2: getting a crash id would be helpful http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Mozilla+Crash+Reporter
13:36  Anomie2: why did you link to that page?
13:36  Anomie2: I pastebin'd the entire contents of the crash reporter
13:36 @kbrosnan: that is not a crash report
13:37  Anomie2: Yes it is - thats the report contents.
13:37 @kbrosnan: no it is not
13:38  Anomie2: ..
13:38  Anomie2: well it says 'Report Contents' on the box its within
13:38 @kbrosnan: a crash report would look like http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/813bff32-29c2-4173-8318-6ff782101027
13:38 @kbrosnan: it may be some of the info from the crash reprorter window
13:38 @kbrosnan: but it is not helpful
13:38 @kbrosnan: we need a crash id
13:41  Anomie2: crashid: 1288614290
13:41 @kbrosnan: that is not a crash id. it needs to look like 813bff32-29c2-4173-8318-6ff782101027
13:49  Anomie2: thats all the fiel says
13:52  Anomie2: *file
13:57 @kbrosnan: Anomie2: Windows? start > run or search > paste in %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Crash Reports\ and press enter
13:57 @kbrosnan: that will open a folder that has the crash report ids
14:00  Anomie2: its thunderbird crash reports im looking at
14:01  Anomie2: ill download firefox again..
14:01 @kbrosnan: you said both were crashing
14:01 @kbrosnan: and you should not need firefox installed to see the crash ids
14:03  huli: Hi, when I use firefox to search some sites it always says waiting for... or transferring data from...
14:03  huli: I'm pretty sure dns and network are fine
14:03  Anomie2: This is the latest one in the firefox folder from about a week ago
14:03  Anomie2: bp-15071118-cfa0-43ff-9d29-12cb12101026
14:10  huli: anyone can show me the way?

17:01  bruteforce_allti: kbrosnan: its en-us
17:01 @kbrosnan: bruteforce_allti: for google or other sites that do ip based redirection you'll need to use their tool to fix it for example http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=873
17:03  bruteforce_allti: What I want, when I load xyz.com,, it should not load xyz/in-en.
17:05 @kbrosnan: that would be a flaw with the site, you would need to work with the site owner to resolve it
17:10  FernandoBasso: I wonder if there is a way to have tabs on the left or right side, rather than in the top.
17:11 @kbrosnan: userstyles or extensions allow for that

17:12  gyzmodo: huge thanks man!
17:12  gyzmodo: works like a charm
17:14  FernandoBasso: So, no tabs on the left/right side unles using and extension?! Okay.
