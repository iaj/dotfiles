16:35  mika__: hi guys, i've read the news about firefox which will be faster than chrome in js............. you should take care also of memory usage and cold startup...... chrome it's much faster for now... and they update more sooner than you... you should take these in consideration...

17:41  Gatto: hello to everyone
17:42  Gatto: what is the cause
17:42  Gatto:  of this message: sec_error_unknown_issuer ?
17:53  niekie: Gatto: hi. That means that the SSL certificate that the server you are connecting to is presenting is not signed by a known issuer.
17:54  Gatto: mah
17:54  Gatto: i have a rapidssl free cert
17:55  niekie: It may also happen if an intermediate certificate is not properly installed, as far as I know.
17:55  Gatto: work fine on ie chrome and safari
17:55  Gatto: okay
17:56  Gatto: you have a support url for this problem?
17:59  niekie: 'fraid not.
18:00  niekie: Hrm, though you might actually find some more relevant info on https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=viewarticle&kbarticleid=1249 which basically described the problem.
18:01  Gatto: bingo this is my message error
18:02  Gatto: niekie≥ I can paste the url of my https server?
18:03  niekie: Gatto: did your provider give you any additional certificates to install?
18:03  orzo: i'm looking for firefox internals developers to chat with
18:03  Gatto: no,
18:04  Gatto: the my ca have send me one cert
18:05  niekie: Hm, wouldn't easily know then. I'm also afraid I have run right now. It's dinnertime. :)
18:05  niekie: I'd suggest contacting your SSL provider's support.
18:06  Gatto: niekie≥ thank you for support
18:06  niekie: No problem :)
18:06  Gatto: okay I contact my CA immediately
