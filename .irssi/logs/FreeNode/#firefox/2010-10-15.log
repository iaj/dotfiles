14:10  temhawk: the reason I think the problem is with cookies is because when the login confirmation page shows, I search for cookies from the site in the Firefox privacy settings and there are no cookies. but in the other browsers there is a PHPSESSID cookie

16:04  nacitar: Not sure how this came about, but I'm using firefox 3.6.10 on ubuntu, and whenever I open firefox or click on my home button, it takes me to a page that is NOT my home page.  At first I assumed something changed the home page, so I looked in preferences.. but no, the home page is set to what it's supposed to be, but it doesn't take me there.  Any ideas where to look?

19:01  temhawk: kbrosnan: i think i might be onto a lead here... a trail of cookie crumbles is taking me to a shabby little hut in the forest, and there seems to be all of my PHPSESSID's cooking inside there.. XD
19:04  temhawk: i'm viewing the HTTP headers with an add-on and the Set-Cookie header is setting the expiration time to ten minutes in the future, but one hour in the past, if you know what I mean... basically the cookie is supposed to expire in 10 minutes, but my computer clock is one hour ahead of the timestamp that the HTTP header sends
19:06  temhawk: now if i could only view the http headers in safari to see if the times are correct there
