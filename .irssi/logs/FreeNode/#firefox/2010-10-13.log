22:42  antlong: hello, is anyone familiar with dyld_library_path
22:44  Mike1_: hey!
22:44  Mike1_: hey! I installed Firefox 4.0 today and I’m using the tabs in traditional mode (not selecting “Tabs on top”). It tries to display all tabs on the screen, making them too small for any title-text if I open more than a dozen tabs. Is there a way to get the old behaviour back?
22:45  Mike1_: or do I have to get a screen with 2560px width? ;-)
22:55 * Mike1_ found the solution with a custom CSS
22:55  Mike1_: why the hell did you remove the option from about:config?
