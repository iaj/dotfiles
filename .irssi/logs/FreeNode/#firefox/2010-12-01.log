00:42  KipMacy: so lets say I'm running firefox, and I have the 'adblock plus' plugin installed.  lets say I load up a website, and on that webpage, there's a tracking image.  adblock plus blocks it!  i don't see it! great.  but am i still being tracked?  did the origin website's tracking image already fire off?

01:06  enthdegree: using the 'default' theme tabbrowser-tab { color #ECDEE !important; } just changes the text color.

01:48  enthdegree: What the shank, my userchrome.css doesn't do anything
02:04  enthdegree: that's solved.
02:05  enthdegree: How do I change my tab border color?
02:06  enthdegree: I have border-top: 1px solid #FF0000 !important; but it's not white, it's red.

03:21  gryllida: sodapop_: you can, using -no-remote switch
03:25  sodapop_: gryllida, not working i'm trying to run multiple instances on different X servers with same profile
03:25  sodapop_: only thing that worked was to delete the lockfiles
03:27  gryllida: sodapop_: use different profiles, same profile won't work
03:27  gryllida: it needs to writ to history and other files, it can't do it to the same profile using 2 instances
03:51  sodapop_: im trying to exec through php a bash script php uses sh -c myscript.sh it seems that variables are empty this way
03:51  sodapop_: any ideas

05:50  e0\m2x: Okay I have a question that will require the unusual problem solving capacities of Dr. House
05:50  e0\m2x: I recently ran a duplicate file deleter on my computer to explore and get used to it, before running it on my precious backup drive which houses a ton of duplicates
05:51  e0\m2x: I didn't delete the files but I moved all the duplicates to a folder away from their own, and in the process I believe that something Firefox relies on was taken away from where it needed to be
05:51  e0\m2x: I cannot pinpoint this file but after that time Firefox takes a good... oh... lets say 3 or 4 -minutes- to load
05:52  e0\m2x: I've gone into safe mode, deleted the things it offers... I've uninstalled it completely, I've then run a register cleaner in hopes to get rid of some bad registry entries that could be the culprit
05:52  e0\m2x: I've searched out all "Firefox" folders and removed them
05:52  e0\m2x: and then re-installed. It still has a newfound loading time of about 4 minutes though, this includes Firefox Portable
05:53  e0\m2x: what on earth could be the cause of this oddity
05:53  e0\m2x: (I'll add I have a good system, 4GB ram, and it used to take FF approx. Umm... lets saya 15-20 seconds to load)
05:53  e0\m2x: if that

09:12  napster: On ubuntu 9.10 and I was able to access video files buffered by firefox in /tmp/ . But Now I can't do the same! What should I do?
09:19 --- KuRupt is now known as bezourox
09:28  gryllida: napster: at addons.mozilla.org, search for 'video download' ; video cache is quite unstable and the websites can change the way the video is transferred at any time
09:29  gryllida: so using an add-on for this purpose might be a quite more stable solution
09:29  napster: gryllida: I'm already using video downloader
09:29  napster: 'plugin
09:30  napster: gryllida: But it seems to be unstable
09:30  gryllida: use another one if this one isn't working
09:30  gryllida: there are dozens (amo editors are even reluctant to accept new ones, there are literally lots)
09:30  gryllida: and maybe email the developer about troubles you have , too
09:30  napster: gryllida: actually how do this thing work? They copy the file from the cache right? Why don't I do it myself?
09:31  gryllida: it doesn't always involve simple cache file copy; some of them take video id and use a certain url pattern to get the video file the website has
09:32  napster: gryllida: oh, ok
09:32  napster: thanks for that info, so its better to use a plugin, can suggest another one?
09:34  auscompgeek: what website do you want to download from?
09:36  napster: youtube
09:36  gryllida: napster, at addons.mozilla.org, search for 'video download'; I don't use any of them myself usually but when I needed I unstalled every one listed in the results, and restarted Firefox, after which one of them worked
09:36  napster: gryllida: cool
09:38  napster: gryllida: But I had one doubt, when I buffer an video entirely from youtube, its somewhere stored on my system, so that I can replay without re-buffering, right? How this system works?
09:38  napster: gryllida: Or where it is stored for replay?
09:41  gryllida: napster, I don't really know whether it's stored, or just rendered
09:41  gryllida: websites don't like people just copying the videos, so they can implement some intricate algorithms
09:41  napster: gryllida: hmm, yes. this is interesting. I'm google how it works... see ya later
09:42  napster: gryllida: Thank you
09:42  napster: :)

16:33  jarray521: I can connect to the internet and use irc, but I cannot use firefox to access the internet. What could cause the problem?
16:35  jarray521: I get the error message: Firefox can't find the server at www.google.com.
16:36 @kbrosnan: firewall or security software tend to be the problem

16:43  webPragmatist: out of curiousity is it possible to make firefox store passwords in the keychain instead of
16:43  webPragmatist: in it's little db
16:52 @kbrosnan: webPragmatist: I don't know of a way to do that
16:53  jarray521: kbrosnan: Thanks. Unfortunately, I can't use my browser. Will look into this more from my friend's machine.
16:54  SomeRandomGuy: hi, i'm trying to handle a special protocol X in forefox. I added all the necessary vars inside about:config, but it still doesn't recognize the protocol. I'm using firefox 3.6.12, on snow leopard
16:56 @kbrosnan: the prefs changed, many sites only document the old way to do that. check to make sure you are useing the post 3.5 prefs http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol
16:56  SomeRandomGuy: I've been to that page, unfortunately it states the steps for versions up to 3.0 on mac
16:57 @kbrosnan: use the linux non-gnome directions
17:01  SomeRandomGuy: yes, it simply suggests adding a network.protocol-handler.expose entry, which would prompt to choose the app handler
17:01  SomeRandomGuy: tried that, didn't work
17:03 @kbrosnan: i don't have access to a mac to check that
17:06  SomeRandomGuy: alright, thanks a lot though

17:44  delby: hi. how do i make system wide changes to firefox on linux?
17:45  delby: i am trying to set home page for all users from one location.
17:45 @kbrosnan: can you assume that the users don't have Firefox profiles?
17:47  delby: they will have whatever firefox generates automatically. i want to override it from system wide config file
17:47 @kbrosnan: but your users don't have pre-existing home directories?
17:48  delby: yes they do.
17:49 @kbrosnan: then it is a lot more complicated.
17:50  delby: you mean because the user defined takes precedent over the system wide?
17:50 @kbrosnan: yes
17:51  delby: i see. thanks.
17:51 @kbrosnan: there is something else, let me look it up
17:51 @kbrosnan: the only problem is that distros might nuke the file when upgrading Firefox
17:52  delby: you mean the system wide one?
17:53 @kbrosnan: http://ilias.ca/blog/2005/03/locking-mozilla-firefox-settings/
17:54  delby: but that is in the user profile again.
17:55  delby: let me give you some more details.
17:55  delby: i am creating a debian live cd, and i want the home page to be google.
17:57  delby: but live systems generate users on boot so i want to edit /etc/iceweasel/profile/prefs.js to set it there.
17:58  delby: the problem is that whatever prefs.js is in the user home dir does not let me.
18:09  delby: kbrosnan: maybe i'm getting it all wrong. in which file is the definition of home page?
18:10 @kbrosnan: in the source?
18:12 @kbrosnan: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/locales/browserconfig.properties
18:13  delby: no in which file on the system is it saved when i set it through the gui preferences.
18:14 --- webPragmatist1 is now known as webPragmatist
18:14 @kbrosnan: prefs.js
18:17  delby: thanks.
18:26  delby: kbrosnan: ok, coming from another angle. when i press 'restore to default' on the home page option in preferences - general, where is that default defined?
18:26 @kbrosnan: https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/other-licenses/branding/firefox/locales/browserconfig.properties
18:31  delby: sorry but i dont understand it :(
18:35 @kbrosnan: delby: check path/to/firefox/defaults/pref/firefox-branding.js
