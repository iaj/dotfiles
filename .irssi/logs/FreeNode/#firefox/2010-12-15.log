03:30  Styper: I'm having a problem with my firefox for some time now, I can't seem to know what's causing this issue
03:30  Styper: Atm I can't close any tabs, If I restart firefox it fixes it but the problem eventually returns
03:30  Styper: Is there a way I can find out what's going on?
03:33  Styper: Btw I only have 1 plugin active(shockwave flash) and 1 language installed(pt-BR)
03:39  Styper: Anyone?
03:55  sneakers: Question#1 How do I view the cookies stored by firefox? Question#2 How do I make the refresh button do a full page reload (like CTRL+F5)?

05:17  cgranade: IS this an appropriate place for asking Fennec for Android questions?
05:21  auscompgeek: cgranade: yes!
05:23  cgranade: Cool. I've been frustrated trying to get Firefox Sync to work from Fennec/Android, and was hoping for some help. There's a post on support.mozilla.com (https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/768605#answer-122011), but I tried what it suggested to no avail.
05:26  cgranade: I would greatly appreciate any help!
05:26  auscompgeek: hm...
05:26  auscompgeek: What version of Firefox (both desktop and mobile) are you using?
05:29  cgranade: 3.6 on the desktop and 4.0b1 on the mobile.
05:35  spasticteapot: Does anyone know a plugin for downloading a whole bunch of webpages?
05:36  spasticteapot: I'd like to download an entire website - essentially just a directory and a whole bunch of text documents - for offline viewing.

05:46  auscompgeek: cgranade: using latest version of Firefox Sync on desktop?
05:47  cgranade: 1.6b5, yeah.
05:48  auscompgeek: I didn't even realise there was a beta for the extension :O
05:50  cgranade: Yeah. I installed it to try and fix the problem.
05:50  auscompgeek: I see.
05:50  auscompgeek: Are you sure your sync key matches?
05:51  cgranade: Yes.
05:52  cgranade: But I'll check again to avoid potential embarassment.
05:53  cgranade: OK, it's not... apparently, it changed when I installed Sync 1.6b5.
05:53  auscompgeek: Interesting...
05:53  auscompgeek: Yeah, I've seen problems like that...
05:53  cgranade: I mean, it's not even remotely close to what I've recorded elsewhere, so I can't imagine I just screwed up and wrote down a completely different key.
05:54  cgranade: It seems that it only accepts autogenerated keys now?
05:55  auscompgeek: I'm not sure.
05:56  cgranade: Anyway, correcting the Sync Key didn't fix the problem, but I'm sure it wasn't helping!

06:08  auscompgeek: Well, it is stated in the topic.
06:08  auscompgeek: Firefox Sync actually has its own channel at moznet.
06:08  cgranade: The topic was truncated in XChat-GNOME, so I didn't notice. Chalk it up to being frustrated.

14:25  itchi: I have donwloaded the debs on my Debian Squeeze box, extracted it and then created the symlinks ln -s /usr/lib/xulrunner-2.0 extracted/usr/lib  but when i run:  ./extracted/usr/bin/firefox  the Iceweasel 3.5 is starting up

15:24  LaraX: bashman: it says it in the topic
15:25  LaraX: irc.mozilla.org
15:36  bashman: how do i join another network with command ?
15:39  LaraCloud: bashman: depending  on your client, /server irc.mozilla.org or /connect irc.mozilla.org should work
15:59  itchi: Hi, i have a Debian Squeeze box, i have downloaded the firefox-4.0b7.tar.bz2, extract it, and it runs ok. But how should i install say the Flash componenent?
16:00  itchi: I have the flash-non-free stuff and it work ok with firefox 3.5, but this seems not recognized or valid for firefox 4
16:15 @kbrosnan: itchi: symlink the flash plugin to the path/to/firefox/plugins folder
16:15  itchi: kbrosnan: Ok, thanks! :)
16:16 @kbrosnan: might need to create the plugins folder
16:16  itchi: kbrosnan: In fact, i'm getting errors:    LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/libflashplayer.so [/usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/libflashplayer.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64]
16:17 @kbrosnan: sounds like you are running 32 bit firefox with the 64 bit flash plugin
16:22  itchi: hmmm
16:23  itchi: kbrosnan: Is there some specific download area for the 64 bits? Not clear here on:  http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html

16:26  Hackwar: hi folks, I've just applied -moz-transform:skewX(30deg) rotate(30deg); to a div and the result somehow does not look like what I expected...
16:27  itchi: ah stupid, i have download that one in the be dire (i'm from Belgium) but that where unreadable characters to me, bah stupid me lol
16:27  Hackwar: it seems as if using skewX and then rotate, its changing skewX to skewY and otherwise ignores rotate
16:27  Hackwar: anybody an idea?
16:27  Hackwar: is that the correct behavior?
16:28  skylamer`: hackwar
16:28  skylamer`: try first rortate then skewx
16:28  Hackwar: yes, that works, but should that make a difference?
16:29  skylamer`: dont know
16:29  skylamer`: :D)
16:29  Hackwar: ok, then I expect this is a bug and I'm going to try to file it. :-)
16:33  itchi: kbrosnan: Man, works great now. Thanks :)
16:33  itchi: kbrosnan: just sad that it's all hidden to 64bit users
16:33  itchi: at least the download link
16:34  runa: hello i want to import my old email folder under thunderbird
16:34 @kbrosnan: itchi: currently almost all linux users get Firefox directly from their distro
16:34  runa: i have thunderbird 3.1.7
16:34 @kbrosnan: runa: #thunderbird can be found on irc.mozilla.org
16:34  runa: thanks
16:35  itchi: kbrosnan: Well, it's to get the Firefox 4 which isn't packaged in Debian yet. I want to take a deeper look at what WebGL can offer as solution to me
16:38  itchi: More precise, i want to create somethings similar to  http://webglsamples.googlecode.com/hg/collectibles/index.html  but about a moped with some extra spare parts
16:53  Hackwar: ok, reporting a bug in FF is not for the fainthearted...
