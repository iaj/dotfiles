00:03  sedulous: How does one disable IPv6 in Firefox quickly?
00:04  sedulous: I want to see if my websites work with IPv4 as well but I don't want to disable on my whole system
00:04  rjohnson19: sedulous: toggle network.dns.disableIPv6 in about:config
00:04 @Peng: It'd be nice to be able to do that per-site.
00:04  sedulous: rjohnson19: I tried that. It appears to be cached and doesn't affect the current session
00:06  rjohnson19: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Network.dns.ipv4OnlyDomains seems to be the per-site, not sure whats needed to get it taking effect (try restarting?)
00:07  sedulous: rjohnson19: restarting is a bit cumbersome for continuous testing. ${someone} should write an addon for this :P
00:08  sedulous: but, I could use a proxy that filters IPv6 and switch with foxyproxy (or PAC generally)
00:08  sedulous: that's probably the most pragmatic way
00:08  sedulous: and it would allow per-site configuration

01:46  Sophiie: hi there, im currently having a problem with my firefox
01:46  Sophiie: where its not opening pages
01:51  soju: I am using FF 4b9 since yesterday. The behaviour for undo close tab (ctrl-shif-t) seems to have changed. It now places the restored tab in a new tab group. I'd like to have the old style back where the restored tab is placed in its original position. How do I do that ?
01:53  rjohnson19: soju: thats a known bug, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=624265 , not sure of any workaround
01:53  soju: aww. Thanks for the info
01:54  rjohnson19: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=624265#c31 looks like other than never using panorama, or using a nightly, there isn't a way to avoid it

05:28  paroh: is fiefox 4 supports GPU??
05:28  paroh: firefox*
05:29  geeknik: paroh: Firefox 4 supports hardware acceleration via various GPUs, depending on your Operating System.
05:30  paroh: windows xp sp3 with ati 57710
05:30  paroh: is this support my gpu and os
05:30  paroh: ?
05:30  geeknik: I think there might be some minimal support under Windows XP, but to get the full benefit, you'll need Windows Vista / Windows 7.

12:17  delby: hi. when i remove the bookmarks bar by unticking View -> Toolbars -> Bookmarks Toolbar, where is that selection saved? i could not find it in prefs.js.
12:20  Gryllida: delby: toolbar confguration... http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox ... localstore.rdf
12:21  delby: Gryllida: thanks.
12:33  delby: Gryllida: sorry, could you please explain. i dont know what to do with that :(
12:55  Gryllida: ?
12:55  Gryllida: it's an xml file
12:55  Gryllida: what are you trying to do?
12:58  delby: i found the file but its empty. i am creating a live cd and i need to configure iceweasel system wide by changing the config files. i want to remove the bookmarks toolbar for all users, so i removed it in gui to see where is the selection set in the config file.
13:01  delby: it worked for other changes. i simply copy the resulting line from ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/prefs.js into the system config file. in my case (iceweasel on debian) its /etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js
13:34  delby: Gryllida: let me give you an example. to stop iceweasel from asking whether to save password, i clicked Edit -> Preferences -> Security and unticked 'Remeber passwords for sites'. i then found that the line user_pref("signon.rememberSignons", false); was added in ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/prefs.js and copied it into  /etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js (without the 'user_' at the beginning)....
13:34  delby: ...that way i can set it for all users without using gui. i want to do the same with regards to bookmarks toolbar but dont know how to.
13:35  Gryllida: untick bookmarks toolbar
13:35  Gryllida: close browser completely
13:35  Gryllida: localstore.rdf shouldn't be empty
13:48  delby: Gryllida: ok got it now, was looking in the wrong place all along. have two localstore.rdf files. thank you very much for your time and patience :)

17:39  nhi: hey is there a cookie manager for firefox 4?
18:24  slkwr: Hey... I screwed up with about:config menu and now it's screwing back with me
18:24  slkwr: how can I collect my bookmarks before reinstalling firefox?
18:24 @Peng: slkwr: What exactly did you do?
18:25 @Peng: slkwr: First of all, reinstalling Firefox won't do anything to your settings. Secondly, there's probably a less drastic way to fix whatever you did.
18:25 @kbrosnan: renaming your prefs.js file probably will help
18:25  slkwr: Peng, Changed many damn default values that I'm not aware of ... I can see this but there no backup for today's bookmarks ... C:\Users\UserPforile\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\790u10go.default
18:26 @Peng: slkwr: ...Why'd you do that? :P
18:26 @Peng: slkwr: Anyway, you should try kbrosnan's suggestion.
18:26  slkwr: Peng, if you don't break it you will never be able to fix it
18:27 @Peng: So did you take a hammer to your toaster oven just for fun?
18:27  slkwr: I wish if I'm a programmer and can develop but I don't have those needed brain cells ... so I'm trying at least to be SuperDuperUser
18:27 @Peng: slkwr: There's information on Google for what most of those prefs mean, you know.
18:28  slkwr: Someone told me already about prefs.js but forgot to mention the path ... I'm windows 7 which is has the worest search machanism I've ever imagined
18:29 @kbrosnan: slkwr: in the folder you mentioned above
18:29  slkwr: Peng, English not my first language ... not many resources in Arabic so I came to ask if help is possible I'd appreciate it
18:30  slkwr: cool ... now it works
18:30  slkwr: many thanks
18:31 @Peng: slkwr: Ah. Yeah, that could be a problem. :-\
18:35  slkwr: what is Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\790u10go.default instead of being at Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\790u10go.default
18:35  slkwr: I'm not using a Roaming profile
18:36 @Peng: slkwr: What's in them?
18:36  slkwr: Mozilla FireFox files are there instead of \UserProfile\Local
18:37 @Peng: Sorry, I'm not a Windows guy, so I don't know a thing.
18:37 @kbrosnan: roaming has files that should be synced for users on domains with roaming profiles
18:37  slkwr: yes kbrosnan and this is a stand alnoe home user machine
18:37  slkwr: that is why I asked
18:37 @kbrosnan: local has files that should not be synced, cache, the safe browsing database
18:38  slkwr: by synced what you mean?
18:38  slkwr: romaing .. right?
18:38 @kbrosnan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming_user_profile
18:39  slkwr: another english book to eat to find a single answer :)
18:39  slkwr: thanks guys
18:40 @kbrosnan: more or less you can store your windows user profile on a server
18:40 @kbrosnan: so that when you log into different computers all your settings follow you
18:42  slkwr: kbrosnan, I know what roaming profiles are. my question is why why applications on windows choosing this path \AppData\Roaming rather than \AppData\Local since the PC is not a part of any domain?
18:42  slkwr: just like firefox for instance
18:43  slkwr: common sense and logic says I will find the prefs.js at \AppData\Local since I'm on a stand alone machine
18:43 @kbrosnan: because doing different things based on the computer being on a domain or not adds a level of complexity
18:44 @kbrosnan: just do the same thing for all windows users
18:45 @kbrosnan: then there could be issues with the user entering or leaving a domain
18:48  slkwr: do you mean in case of the folder was shared between different users?
18:48  slkwr: please notice that there is %Userporfile%\ before AppData\Roaming
18:49 @Peng: slkwr: It's easier to always put things in Roaming. That way if you join a domain, you'll benefit immediately, instead of having to move stuff around.

19:23  bug2000: How do I get firefox into and out of typing mode?

19:39  slkwr: Peng, I disagree with your statemtn "<Peng> slkwr: It's easier to always put things in Roaming. That way if you join a domain, you'll benefit immediately, instead of having to move stuff around."
19:39  slkwr: there is no need to create a Roaming Folder if the machine is stand alone
19:40  slkwr: from the easiness side at least
19:40 @Peng: slkwr: It's one folder. It takes a few KB of disk space. What's the big deal?
19:40 @Peng: slkwr: It would be far less easy for an application to have to check if you are part of a domain, and use a crystal ball to see if you ever will be in the future.
19:40 @Peng: slkwr: mkdir Roaming is far easier.
19:41  ChrisBuchholz: Ey people, i am having trouble downloading firefox mobile for android via android market. Downloads starts and then just stops without any warning. I have no trouble downloading other apps. Is this a know issue or?
19:42  slkwr: Peng, it's then useless to distingush or even create undeeded files unless part of a domain
19:42 @kbrosnan: but the files are the standard part of a profile
19:42  slkwr: it would be much better application decide if anything is changed
19:43 @kbrosnan: that is a disaster waiting to happen
