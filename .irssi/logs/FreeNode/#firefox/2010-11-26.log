00:50  feep: hi
00:50  feep: building current hg head, tabs and panorama are ridiculously broken.
00:51  feep: is there a semi-safe commit?
00:51  feep: cutting edge, but not bleeding.

01:29 @gavin: feep: tests are passing on tinderbox, so tabs and panorama are not ridiculously broken :)
01:30  feep: well they are here. ._.
01:30 @gavin: are you perhaps seeing bug 604381?
01:30  feep: right-mouse open a tab, click on it
01:30  feep: it doesn't do anything, go back one - new tab disappears.
01:30  feep: also panorama looks really weird as opposed to the tab candy preview version
01:30 @gavin: ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=604381 )
01:31 @gavin: there must be something unique to your setup - profile issue, addon, odd build config, etc.
01:31  feep: mh, probably. :/
01:31  feep: thanks

02:39  denysonique: Does Fx cache DNS lookups? Where can I extend the time it keeps the DNS's?
02:39  denysonique: Does it prefetch the DNS too?
02:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#firefox +o gavin_]
03:00 @kbrosnan: denysonique: yes, not sure, yes if the prefetch attribute is used
03:00  denysonique: kbrosnan, i.e?
03:01  denysonique: about:config string?
03:03 @kbrosnan: i suspect you can't increase the dns cache time

03:34  proestor: why does google suck so much these days?
03:35  proestor: i mean jesus fucking christ
03:35  proestor: the site is horrible compared to what it was in the early 2000s
03:41 @kbrosnan: 1) not many eyes on irc on thanksgiving evening. 2) need a reasonable replacement that can handle the load of 400M users. 3) that more or less means bing, yahoo or google
03:47  geeknik: i don't even use google, yahoo or bing much anymore.. i rotate between blekko and duckduckgo. =)

04:16  proestor: and the search results suck now
04:16  proestor: half or more of the search results for websites or images are irrelevant

10:20  proestor: i mean christ, you guys could be just a *bit* more intuitive
10:21  Cork: tools > addons > plugins
10:21  Cork: i think thats farly intuative
10:22  proestor: i was looking in options
10:22  Cork: why should firefox have options for a plugin?
10:23  proestor: why isnt it tool>options i mean
10:23  Cork: it depends on os
10:23  Cork: firefox follows the os standard for the position of the dialog
10:23  Cork: windows has tools options, linux has edit/mac > preferences
10:24  Cork: *linux/mac has edit > preferences
10:24  auscompgeek: no
10:24  auscompgeek: mac has firefox > preferences
10:24  Cork: heh
10:24  Cork: what ever ^^'
10:27  auscompgeek: Cork is sweating again
10:52  geeknik: Is Firefox Sync down? Can't remember if there was maintenance scheduled for tonight.
11:25  geeknik: Anyone else having issues like this? http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2042375&p=10165703#p10165703 and http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2042375&p=10166117#p10166117
11:25  geeknik: driving me crazy...
11:36  SmokeyD: hey everyone. Is it possible in firefox extensions to let the extension execute a command on the local desktop machine? I want the extension to start a local program (executable) that will generate a file, that the extension then uses to modify the html of a (my) webapplication that the user is visiting
11:37  Cork: sure it is
11:38  Cork: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=614897
11:38  geeknik: SmokeyD: http://mozex.mozdev.org/
11:39  SmokeyD: geeknik: of course. I have used mozex before myself. Why didn't I think of that
11:39  SmokeyD: thanks
11:39  geeknik: you're welcome =)
11:47  SmokeyD: is it possible with the userchrome.css file to remove the whole "File","Edit",etc bar?
11:48  geeknik: Yes.
11:51  geeknik: #helpMenu,
11:51  geeknik: #edit-menu
11:51  geeknik: { display: none !important }
11:51  SmokeyD: geeknik: :) Ok, thanks.
11:51  geeknik: IDs for all of the menus are file-menu, edit-menu, view-menu, go-menu, bookmarks-menu, tools-menu, helpMenu
11:51  geeknik: might try and just use menubar { display: none !important } and see if that works too.
11:53  SmokeyD: geeknik: cool. Thanks a lot. Do you know a page where all the css properties are listed or something? I am searching google, but only found tons of examples, not one coherent listing of all properties
11:54  geeknik: try http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html
11:55  SmokeyD: geeknik: you are my hero. Thanks ;)

14:54  RusAlex: hi anybody, i want to solve next problem:
14:55  RusAlex: i use firefox with http proxy settings, and my proxy require auth. I need to click "OK" in prompt auth window every time when im starting firefox. how to avoid it ?
15:43  AnthonyCat: why does this generate random numbers in firefox?: setTimeout(alert,3)
15:54 @kbrosnan: i think the number is how late the alert was called
15:54 @kbrosnan: in miliseconds
16:12  karlo94: why facebook chat do not work for me on firefox? ..it works on google chrome..
16:13  Tobias|: Curious bug. If there's a flash applet that fills firefox's viewport, pressing F11 and activating the applet blocks me from accessing any of firefox's interface controls :<
16:14 @kbrosnan: karlo94: check if chat works in Firefox's safe mode http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode
16:14  karlo94: ok
16:16 @kbrosnan: Tobias|: that is the flash applet going fullscreen not firefox
16:16  Tobias|: No
16:16  Tobias|: I said that it fills firefox's viewport
16:16  Tobias|: And I pressed F11, making *firefox* go full screen
16:17  Tobias|: Not flash
16:17  Tobias|: If it were flash, I could click escape
16:17 @kbrosnan: if the flash object has focus it eats all conrols
16:17  Tobias|: The only way I can see to get firefox out of this is alt + f4
16:17 @kbrosnan: os?
16:17  Tobias|: Linux
16:17  Tobias|: Flash is hard-coded to leave full screen on escape
16:18  Tobias|: And I can click Flash's full screen button to switch between Flash's full screen and firefox's full screen
16:18  Tobias|: or, the flash applets
16:20  karlo94: kbrosnan, that with safe mod didn't worked.. :S
16:20  Tobias|: Which version are you using, karlo94 ?
16:21  karlo94: Tobias|, Namoroka/3.6.14pre
16:21  karlo94: .. on ubuntu 10.10
16:22 @kbrosnan: might try using the user agent switcher extension to make your user agent look exactly like a Firefox 3.6 version
