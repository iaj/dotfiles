01:53  freetown2: altF4_, I don't compile firefox. But compiling anything, getting better hardware always speeds things up

02:37  Digicrime: hi
02:37  Digicrime: i have a problem
02:37  Digicrime: under tools>>options>>applications>> http, i cant make this be firefox as default
02:38  freetown2: aw, i hope you can get some support because i sure did not
02:38 * freetown2 goes into troll mode
02:39  Digicrime: i mean, when it asks me what to use, it'll say i need to open it with an appliation, so i select firefox and it just contiously opens new windows of itself. so, on another user's profile here on vista i looked, and for http, it said firefox (default)
02:39  Digicrime: how can i fix this?
02:39  Digicrime: freetown2: sorry
02:40  Digicrime: anyone?
02:41 @kbrosnan: there should not be any such listing inside Firefox
02:41  Digicrime: what such listing?
02:42 @kbrosnan: for http
02:42  Digicrime: o ok
02:42  Digicrime: how can i restore it to like the default things then?
02:42  Digicrime: oh wait
02:42 * freetown2 gasps. hey Digicrime your problem got seen to right away
02:42 @kbrosnan: delete mimetypes.rdf from the profile
02:42  Digicrime: its in this one, too
02:42  Digicrime: kbrosnan: i did that
02:43  Digicrime: already
02:43  Digicrime: and it still needed something to open the http
02:43  Digicrime: i selected firefox
02:43  Digicrime: but that just kept opening windows contiously
02:44 @kbrosnan: sounds like a broken site or your Firefox profile is badly dammaged
02:44  Digicrime: how can i fix that
02:44 @kbrosnan: freetown2: i don't see any recent questions from you
02:44  Digicrime: well
02:44  Digicrime: the thing is
02:44  freetown2:  hi all, anybody know why firefox is dead set on looking for stuff in some other profile directory other than that in profiles.ini?
02:44  freetown2: repost
02:44  freetown2:  contents of profiles.ini http://firefox.pastebin.com/eG0NLQ5C
02:45  freetown2: logs: http://firefox.pastebin.com/nU11dJrw firefox looking for something with a completely different profile directory
02:45  Digicrime: kbrosnan: on your applications, is http there?
02:46 @kbrosnan: not inside Firefox
02:46  Digicrime: then where?
02:46 @kbrosnan: Windows
02:46  Digicrime: i mean, how can i restore those applications to default then?
02:47  Digicrime: kbrosnan: you know how?
02:49  Digicrime: kbrosnan: you there?
02:49  Digicrime: inside windows?
02:49  Digicrime: what?
02:49 @kbrosnan: hm?
02:50  Digicrime: kbrosnan: what should i do?
02:51 @kbrosnan: if you are talking about the settings inside Firefox they can be reset by deleting mimeTypes.rdf from your profile folder with Firefox closed
02:51  Digicrime: hmm
02:51  Digicrime: but that's what i already did
02:52  Digicrime: freetown2: maybe you should try back another time
02:53  Digicrime: kbrsonan: so what should i do
02:53  Digicrime: thanks for helping
02:53  Digicrime: what should i do?
02:53  freetown2: Digicrime, or maybe I should push out Google Chrome...
02:53 @kbrosnan: freetown2: putting your profile on a network share is not really supported
02:53 @kbrosnan: Digicrime: make a new profile? copy over the relevant data
02:55  freetown2: kbrosnan, duh....all Application Data is being redirected to a network share...we know that firefox won't run on two computers at the same time. that's not the issue here. is the profile path generated from the file path?
02:55  Digicrime: kbrsonan: is that it?
02:55  freetown2: do i just need to rename the profile directory and correct the profiles.ini?
02:57 @kbrosnan: freetown2: my guess is that you've done some cloning of profiles and it is picking up the profile you used for the clone
02:57  Digicrime: kbrosnan: is that the only thing i can do?
02:58  Digicrime: kbrsonan: i think it was an extension
02:58  Digicrime: it didn't happen until after i installed mr toolkit and mr toolkit wrapper
02:58  freetown2: kbrosnan, nothing of the sort. the only change was that the network path in that all data was migrated to a new server
02:58 @kbrosnan: you could try removing everything that is not listed at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Recovering+important+data+from+an+old+profile
03:00  freetown2: i think i will just give the profile directory name change a shot...this looks like firefox is somehow generating the profile path on the fly
03:02  Digicrime: kbrsonan: do you think it was those add ons or not?
03:06 @kbrosnan: Digicrime: i have no idea, i don't use either of them
03:07  Digicrime: well could you look at them
03:07  Digicrime: please

07:57  obiwan_: darn again
07:57  obiwan_: lol freetown2 you support all those people? i bet you were into tqs.
07:58  obiwan_: ok... i dont know what the heck is tqs
07:58  obiwan_: but still i bet for that one, definitely.

10:07  Cobalt: Hello there, people. Is there a way to put the location bar and the tab bar together, to save space?
10:12  auscompgeek: O_o
10:12  auscompgeek: It will be possible in 4.0.
10:12  auscompgeek: It'll be ugly though...
10:13  Cobalt: It'd be all right on a wide screen. You'd have your location bar on the left, with the tabs on the right. And say, optionally press ALT (like with that plugin) to display the menubar. Right now I have the menubar and location bar with a couple of buttons all on one line.
10:17 --- meiskam_ is now known as meiskam
10:18  Cobalt: Right now my menu bar is to the right of the location bar, and it looks ugly.
10:20  auscompgeek: Cobalt: The menu bar will be condensed to a Firefox button.
10:21  Cobalt: Just like in Opera... Hmm... I'm just Googling the beta. I think I'm going to try install that. I hadn't realised it was that advanced yet.
10:27  auscompgeek: www.firefox.com/beta
10:27  auscompgeek: Cobalt: ^
10:28  Cobalt: auscompgeek: I need to get it for Ubuntu. They've got a repository with the 6th beta release, but thanks anyway, I was also checking out that site. :)
10:29  auscompgeek: Ah.
10:29  auscompgeek: You could build it from source. :)
10:29  Cobalt: No point. There is also a PPA for daily builds. :D
10:33  auscompgeek: Oh. :D
10:33  Cobalt: Crap. The only downside is that I have to download 90MB of debug symbols.
10:33  auscompgeek: O_o
10:33  Cobalt: Woops, my bad. No. I enabled a package that required it. :) Awesome.
11:43  Velmont: Hmmz. The language sniffer for firefox 4 beta is wrong. :( It's giving me bokmaal although I prefer nynorsk, and my browser says so in its headers.
14:10  icwiener: Hi, I screwed up my ssl certificates. Is it possibe to reset them to the defaults?
14:14 @kbrosnan: if it is profile specifc then it is simple
14:14 @kbrosnan: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox#Files
14:14 @kbrosnan: see the cert entries
14:20 * icwiener looks ...
14:22  icwiener: Is it enough to remobe the cert_overrride file to get all certificates back or do I have to delete the .db as well and Firefiox restores it on next startup?
14:25 @kbrosnan: just rename the files with Firefox closed. Firefox on linux is a bit different as most distros break out certs to their own package
14:25  icwiener: Ah, I see.
14:25 @kbrosnan: and restart firefox. if that helps then you won't need to mess around with your package manager
14:27  icwiener: kbrosnan: Thans, that solved the problem. :)
14:27  icwiener: *Thanks
14:28 @kbrosnan: glad is was something simple
14:29 @kbrosnan: you also might have been able to remove the certs you did not want via http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window+-+Advanced+panel#Encryption_tab
14:39  icwiener: *coughs* Yes, that was what I did in the first place and what broke some websites. ;)
15:05  ychaouche: hello, I want to enter "<word> vs <word>" in the adresse bar and have firefox browse to "http://www.hiprank.com/<word>-vs-<word>.html". How do I acheive this ?
15:07 @kbrosnan: not possible. if word and word is really word1 and word2. well not possible by default
15:07 @kbrosnan: mgiht be something extension like that could allow that
15:09  ychaouche: kbrosnan, thanks for your answer, I'll look after bookmark plugins then
15:20  ychaouche: maybe url_alias
15:27  axx_: hey all, running 3.6.12 on Ubuntu Maverick 10.10, Firefox hangs after a few minutes of useâ€¦
15:27  A-KO: Quick question. What do you do when a root CA needs added to default FF install? It's included with Windows, and apparently works in FF in Linux
15:28  A-KO: But FF Windows for some reason doesn't have it
15:28  axx_: I've got masses of tabs open (~90) but also have an extension, Bar Tab, that keeps only the active ones loaded and unloads the other ones
15:28  A-KO: it's "USERTrust PositiveSSL CA"
15:29 @kbrosnan: i would check the cert chain first with openssl
15:29  A-KO: the cert chain is fine.
15:30  A-KO: works in every other browser except FF...
15:30  A-KO: so
15:31 @kbrosnan: you've run openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 ?
15:31 @kbrosnan: axx_: check firefox's safe mode, http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+troubleshooting#Troubleshoot_extensions_and_themes
15:31  axx_: kbrosnan: tried that, still ended up not responding
15:31  axx_: :/
15:31 @kbrosnan: new profile?
15:32  axx_: I'm using a new profile right now
15:32  axx_: :)
15:32 @kbrosnan: or renaming your .mozilla folder
15:32 @kbrosnan: is that good or bad?
15:32  axx_: it's ok so far
15:32  axx_: I've got 4 tabs open, feels empty ;)
15:32  axx_: I'll see if it hangs or not
15:32  axx_: what about renaming .mozilla, tell me more ?
15:33 @kbrosnan: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Recovering+important+data+from+an+old+profile lists the basics that should be safe to transfer
15:37 @kbrosnan: axx_: renaming your ~/.mozilla is just a slightly more drastic step than making a new profile. it can clear out some user specific plugins
15:37  axx_: kbrosnan: ok, good to know
15:37 @kbrosnan: assuming they are present in ~/.mozilla/plugins
15:39  axx_: kbrosnan: do you have any add-ons recommendations for dealing with many tabs, something that would group them in a sensible way or such ?
15:39  axx_: every thing I've found is so-so :/
15:41 @kbrosnan: i don't use any such addons
15:42  axx_: ok then :)

16:57  dbugger: Hey guys! Can someone please tell me why my video isnt showing in this page? http://events.gruponavega.eu/uk/
16:57  Adamantus: I've been using noscript for Firefox for a while now. One thing I don't get is, why do some sites use javascript for alignment of html/css? For example, sometimes words will get jumbled / overlapped up just because the scripting is turned off.
17:01 @kbrosnan: dbugger: your video does not have a good mime type http://pastebin.mozilla.org/834317
17:06  dbugger: kbrosnan, How can I fix it?
17:07 @kbrosnan: consult the server documentation, if apache .htaccess and http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype
17:08  dbugger: That was a modified file. I've replaced it with the original. Could you please tell me if it's MIME type is right?
17:09 @kbrosnan: still stays text/plain
17:10  dbugger: I see. so what Mime type should I add?
17:11 @kbrosnan: application/ogg
17:12  dbugger: not video/ogg?
17:12 @kbrosnan: video/ogg might be ok too
17:15  dbugger: but adding a text/plain as a video is a little messy, isnt it? Isnt there a way to change the MIME of the file?
17:15 @kbrosnan: huh?
17:15 @kbrosnan: text/plain is the problem. the server has the final say as to the mime type
17:16 @kbrosnan: it is not something that can be fixed client side
17:16  dbugger: Couldnt I "fix the file" somehow?
17:16  dbugger: Oh wait, now I get it
17:16 @kbrosnan: there is nothing wrong with the file
17:16  dbugger: Yeah, i need to change the .htaccess :S
17:28  dbugger: kbrosnan, I added the rule in the.htaccess but it's not working still :(
17:30  dbugger: Do I need to restart the server?
17:31 @kbrosnan: dbugger: ctrl + shift + r
17:32  dbugger: silly me :P
17:32  dbugger: thanks for your help, that was great
