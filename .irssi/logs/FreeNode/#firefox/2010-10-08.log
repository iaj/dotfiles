02:26  detrate`: auscompgeek: do you know if I can force all tabs to not reload on startup with bartab? It seems more like TooManyTabs

02:26  detrate`: thanks, I'm going to give it a whirl
02:41  detrate`: the only thing that would make it better would if it showed the offline version

11:07  Cursarion: are there addons that can control the browser identification line?
11:08  moriarty: Cursarion, something like User Agent Switcher ought to do the trick
11:09  richardcavell: Is there any addon that will regularly delete cookies from my system after inactivity?
11:09  Cursarion: I tried searching the addons, but couldn't find anything with the keywords I tried... Didn't try anything with user agent though
11:09  Cursarion: I'll check it out, thanks moriarty
11:09  moriarty: you're welcome :)
12:21  wrksx: hi all, I ran some tests, and when I use <shift> + <refresh> to bypass the cache mechanism I found out that 2 HTTP GET request where actually sent.
12:22  wrksx: the first, Pragma: no-cache, Cache-Control: no-cache
12:23  wrksx: the second, is standard request
12:24  wrksx: any idea why 2 requests are sent ?

15:22  sktrdie: hello
15:23  sktrdie: my firefox on windows renders pages extremely slow compared to other browsers i have installed
15:23  sktrdie: what shoudl i do?
15:23  sktrdie: i tried running it in safe mode
15:23  sktrdie: also it scrambles some CSS things... so i'm thinking it's some FF issue

15:24  sktrdie: any ideas?
15:34  the20year2: can anyone help me? Firefox is freezing consistantly (I've never had this issue before, and it's started happening mostly since the lastupdate)

15:44  gyyg: I have installed 3 different flash plugins, and still no flash video
15:44  gyyg: any suggestions on what I can do?
15:57 @kbrosnan: gyyg: you'll need to clean up/uninstall all the flash plugins and then just install Adobe flash from the package manager
15:57  mattalexx: Is there an extension that will give this functionality to 3.6? http://frankyan.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/making-tab-closing-easy/
15:59 @kbrosnan: there are 1000s of extensions, keeping track of them all is imposible. search is your friend
16:02  mattalexx: kbrosnan, Obviously I searched Google before I came here. Didn't find anything.
16:03  mattalexx: Thought I would ask some powerusers.
