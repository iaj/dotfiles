15:58  onre: hi folks. anyone have experience of confirm() making firefox hang? or not exactly hang... i can even open new windows by doubleclicking the app icon on desktop, but can't click on anything inside the app. as if it never received any UI events. this is on win7, ff3.6.12
15:59  onre: oddly enough, this happens only on some firefox 3.6.12:s. i've tried to narrow it down but flash version doesn't matter (said confirm is in a javascript function that's called by flash), neither do other plugins. for example, the js code in question works fine on my other laptop, but one co-worker gets the same hang.

21:57  geeknik: Someone needs to update the topic in here.
21:58  geeknik: Firefox 3.6.12 was released a while back. Firefox 4.0 Beta 7 is out too.
21:58 --- kbrosnan has changed the topic to:  Mozilla Firefox community support on Freenode | For other Mozilla software, or if no one is active, go to: irc.mozilla.org #firefox #thunderbird #chatzilla and more | http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Basic+Troubleshooting | Use http://pastebin.mozilla.org/ for pasting | Firefox 3.6.12 released http://getfirefox.com/
21:58  geeknik: Thanks. =)
21:58 @kbrosnan: not enough space for the beta info
21:59  geeknik: I think you're the only op that even spends time in here.
22:00 @kbrosnan: 4 of the 6 ops logged in right now are moz employees. they are kinda busy atm
22:00 @kbrosnan: i've seen each of them be active at different times
22:01  geeknik: Yeah, they're always busy. :) Which means I'll never get my firefox cloak.
22:03  geeknik: in other good news, my first patch got approval2.0 on bugzilla. =)
22:03  geeknik: Nothing special, just adds correct punctuation to an .ini file, but every little bit helps.
22:04 @kbrosnan: gavin_ mzz? if you get a free moment check the cloak etherpad
22:06 @gavin: kbrosnan: firefox/community/qa probably works better hierarchically, sound good?
22:07  mzz: hmm?
22:07 @gavin: (firefox/community/qa/kbrosnan that is)
22:07 @kbrosnan: sure
22:07 @gavin: mzz: can you add some firefox cloaks if I approve them?
22:07  mzz: certainly

22:51  geeknik: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases/Firefox_4.0b7 still says that Firefox 4.0 Beta 7 is not quite ready yet. =)
22:56 @kbrosnan: according to some comments in irc.mozilla.org it is not quite out yet
