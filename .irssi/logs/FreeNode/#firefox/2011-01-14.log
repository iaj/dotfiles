10:41  rawplayer: hi
10:41  rawplayer: is there a plug in for autoclosing the find screen?
10:41  rawplayer: like closing it after 5 seconds
10:41  rawplayer: the ctrl+f search function i mean
10:44  notregistered: i have spotted a css bug
11:25  notregistered: i use margin-left: -25px; to position a div and when the page is short (no scrollbar) it displays correctly, but when the page is long (scollbar), the div is moved 1px extra to the left

15:15  harking: who do i talk to abot an issue with the bugzilla search timing out?
15:15  harking: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&product=Firefox&content=Firefox+4+ready+JavaScript
15:17 @Peng: #bmo on irc.mozilla.org, perhaps?
15:17 @kbrosnan: that is a very general query. Firefox matches a lot of stuff
15:17 @kbrosnan: the query ran for me and matched 12081 bugs

15:27  bencahill: hey, are there any plugins that will prevent duplicate tabs (urls)?
15:36  geeknik: bencahill: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/prevent-duplicate-tabs/
15:51  RingZer0: looking for a fast way to learn how to build a firefox plugin... I program in C++/Java/PHP/JavaScript (DOM) ... But need a fast how-to and API...
15:52  geeknik: Plugin or Extension?
15:52  geeknik: plugin would be something like java or flash. extension would be something like noscript or adblock plus.
15:53  RingZer0: Hmm... well I'm not sure
15:53  geeknik: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/building_an_extension is a good place to start for extensions.
15:54  RingZer0: I want to create a plugin/extension that appends javascript files.  with optional checkboxes for appending common js libs such as jquery or prototype
15:54  geeknik: and here is the place to read up on plugins - https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Plugins
15:55  RingZer0: Personally., I would like to automate similar to AutoIt... but via JS, not requiring the mouse... just using selectors and .click()
15:55  geeknik: an extension is probably the route to go for something like that.
15:55  RingZer0: geeknik: what do you suggest for the application I mentioned.
15:56  RingZer0: I want to make it open source so ppl can make it better if they would like.
15:56  geeknik: sounds good. =) i'd take a look at the extension docs and go from there. =)
15:56  RingZer0: okay sir, thanks a bunch
15:56  geeknik: you're welcome. =)
15:59  RingZer0: I think understanding a glossary of mozilla terms would be cool while reading this
16:00  RingZer0: found one good read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPInstall
16:03  RingZer0: *learning XUL
16:09  geeknik: Yeah, once you get that stuff out of the way, building an extension is pretty straightforward, and considering you already know how to write code, you should have an easy time with it. =)
17:03  jair: hello guys, I am trying to install firefox 4 b9 from source in a linux debian squeeze system, I am in the "./configure" stage and I am getting an error: configure: error: --enable-application=APP was not specified and is required.
17:04 @Peng: jair: What build instructions are you following?
17:04  jair: I am running the command "./configure" without any specifications, and if I need to specify something there I tried "--enable-application=APP" but did not work.
17:04 @kbrosnan: you'll need to create a .mozconfig file
17:05 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions
17:05 @kbrosnan: see the configuring build options section
17:05  jair: Peng: I am following this ones: http://forum.codecall.net/linux-tutorials-guides-tips/18664-firefox-3-5-debian-lenny-stable-amd64.html
17:06  jair: kbrosnan: I did create a .mozconfig file
17:06 @kbrosnan: did you specify an app?
17:06 @kbrosnan: and firefox should be built using make -f client.mk
17:08  jair: ohhh
17:08  RingZer0: so .mk is like a makefile?
17:08  jair: I am sorry but I did specify "browser" now and it works
17:09  jair: kbrosnan: when I will have to run that command ?make -f client.mk? when I finish the ./configure?
17:11 @kbrosnan: no that is a one-stop command to build
17:15  jair: kbrosnan: alright I am not understanding, 1. I downloaded the source code uncompress it 2. inside the directory for the new firefox run the command ./configure --enable-application=browser 3. run the command make -f client.mk?
17:16 @kbrosnan: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Simple_Firefox_build#Building_Firefox
17:19  jair: kbrosnan: so the answer is "yes"
17:19  jair: kbrosnan: thank you so much for the link by the way
17:19 @kbrosnan: the configure statement is taken care of during the build process
17:22  jair: kbrosnan: I ran "make" and it is building now, with the make -f client.mk I got an error
17:23  jair: kbrosnan: I am following this instructions ---> http://forum.codecall.net/linux-tutorials-guides-tips/18664-firefox-3-5-debian-lenny-stable-amd64.html
17:23  jair: kbrosnan: I have done that install before that's why I know that will work, the instructions you sent me I will test them from the begining in a nother linux system
18:14  Raac: im trying to set privacy settings as 'use custom settings' ... but it automatically goes back to 'remember history'
18:16  Raac: nm got it
18:19  tknudsen: hola.  firefox 4b10 nightly has crashed once already and is walking with a limp.
18:21  geeknik: and that is why it is called minefield. ;)
18:22 @kbrosnan: tknudsen: have a crash id? about:crashes in the address bar
18:55  tknudsen: address bar?  where's that?
18:55  geeknik: tknudsen: the place where you type in URLs
18:56  tknudsen: ok, I don't see About Crashes
18:56  geeknik: you type about:crashes and it brings up a list of Crash IDs
18:56  tknudsen: ah, I see.  tnx
18:56  geeknik: yw
18:57  tknudsen: lists about 20 reports
18:57  geeknik: most recent is at the top
18:57  tknudsen: cool.  anything I can do to be a better QA monkey?
19:00 @kbrosnan: check the crash report for a bug number
19:01  tknudsen: nice bug reports, and those bugs get assigned and closed PDQ.
19:01 @kbrosnan: if there is not one then reporting the crash
19:02  tknudsen: ok, noted.  tnx kbrosnan
21:28  Intel_iX: is this a bug in the scriptengine? http://pastebin.com/PFj1aDmm
