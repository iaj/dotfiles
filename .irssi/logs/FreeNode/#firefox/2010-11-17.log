12:12  hiptobecubic: Is there a way to force ff to open a resource as text/plain?
12:13  hiptobecubic: someone links to a file on a server, i know it's 8-bit ascii but they set the mimetype wrong or who knows what and firefox wants me to save it as a file. I just want to open it in the browser
12:31  gryllida: hiptobecubic, yes. add 'view-source:' before its path.
12:31  hiptobecubic: gryllida, is that so? ... hmmm
12:39  denysonique: hiptobecubic, ok
12:39  denysonique: hiptobecubic, are you the user or owner of the site?
12:40  hiptobecubic: denysonique, no.
12:40  hiptobecubic: denysonique, sorry, user.
12:40  denysonique: hiptobecubic, you just want to view the file? or enable users to veiw it?
12:40  hiptobecubic: denysonique, could be anyfile out in the blue on any site. I want it to render as if it were ascii in the browser window (because it is)
12:40  denysonique: hiptobecubic, maybe there is a plugin that overrides mime-types
12:41  hiptobecubic: denysonique, i looked but didn't see any up-to-date
12:41  denysonique: hiptobecubic, there is a Fx option a think that lets you decide what Fx does with the file
12:41  hiptobecubic: a what?
12:41  denysonique: 2. the site you are using sucks
12:41  denysonique: hiptobecubic, Fx option
12:41  denysonique: Fx → firefox
12:41  hiptobecubic: oh
12:42  hiptobecubic: denysonique, it would be great if it were just one of the 'save' options. Save-as, Open-with, Open-as-text etc
12:43  denysonique: hiptobecubic, http://denysonique.tk/screenshots/Wed_Nov_17_11.43.18_GMT_2010.png
12:44  hiptobecubic: but then you have to know about the file in advance, no?
12:47  hiptobecubic: denysonique, also, preview in firefox isn't a choice for many of them
12:47  hiptobecubic: like "Text File"
12:47  denysonique: hiptobecubic, what site is it btw?
12:48  hiptobecubic: http://liquorix.net/sources/patches/cfs-autogroup/  in this example
12:48  denysonique: hiptobecubic, just mail them www@example.com ← topic: yoru site sucks
12:48  hiptobecubic: the diff works, the *.eml does not
12:50  denysonique: hiptobecubic, just set fx to handle eml's by it self or if you don't like that way, you can write your own plugin that fixes that and help other users too
12:52  hiptobecubic: denysonique, i don't know the second thing about writing ff plugins :/   or anything about ff's file/mimetype-handling
12:52  denysonique: http://denysonique.tk/screenshots/Wed_Nov_17_11.43.18_GMT_2010.png
12:52  denysonique: that where you add new entries
12:52  denysonique: hiptobecubic, do you program at all?
12:53  hiptobecubic: denysonique, i dick around in python and make very trivial changes to things in c/c++
12:54  denysonique: hiptobecubic, yeah, you can write a fx plugin then
13:09  gryllida: https://forums.mozilla.org/addons/viewforum.php?f=28&sid=fa5b8658dd7d9612158ff0443a33d435
13:09  gryllida: AMO forum, 'Add-on Ideas' section. Post there if you want someone to do it for you.
13:09  gryllida: generally it is easier to write yourself though, since you know what you need, and have the will to finish
13:10  hiptobecubic: working on it
13:10  gryllida: your issue sounds more like a server issue
13:10  hiptobecubic: can't fix the servers
13:10  gryllida: server must send a correct mime type
13:10  gryllida: email them.... (the issue should take place on other browsers as well)
13:10  denysonique: then you can sell your extension via the DRMised Mozilla add-on store
13:11  gryllida: WTF
13:11  gryllida: it's open source spirit
13:11  gryllida: don't ruin it
13:11  gryllida: :(
13:11  denysonique: lolmao
13:12  denysonique: there is going to be an apocalypse, Free Software is going to become illegal. and only DRM computers without CD drives nor usb slots will only be available
13:12  gryllida: You do it
13:13  gryllida: Mozilla will manufacture old style computers and cooperate with other manufacturers who do so
13:13  gryllida: It will win eventually, because of the better security open source world gives
13:13  hiptobecubic: 'old style computers' are all patented
13:13  denysonique: no, mozilla will be acquired by apple
13:13  gryllida: no
13:13  gryllida: we volunteer
13:13  hiptobecubic: gryllida, have fun
13:13  gryllida: if some of the mozilla head sells it to apple, it will be forked
13:13  gryllida: like libreoffice is
13:13  denysonique: and mariadb
13:14  gryllida: openoffice was bought by oracle, then libreoffice was forked and is developer by openoffice people
13:14  denysonique: actually that's cool, they have sold their projects and still can have develop forks of them:)
13:14  gryllida: for people, yes
13:15  gryllida: for those who run openoffice
13:15  hiptobecubic: i would just like to say, that the libreoffice fork is extremely unfortunate. the OpenOffice name was professional and nice and I became very attached to it. LO.o is stupid. OO.o is great.
13:15  denysonique: hmm, I hate that Oracle logo when I launch ooofice, time to get libreoffice
13:15  denysonique: hiptobecubic, thats just branding
13:15  denysonique: you just got used to the name
13:15  gryllida: the initiative to maintain the code is good (they still hope to buy the trademark from oracle back)
13:15  hiptobecubic: denysonique, as anyone on the business side of business can tell you, branding is everything.
13:16  denysonique: oracle is a patent troll
13:16  gryllida: kind of.
13:16  denysonique: hiptobecubic, yes, but quality and freedom will define a new brand
13:16  hiptobecubic: No sure. It's possible to establish a new brand. But it hurts to have to give up your mindshare.
13:17  hiptobecubic: my plugin doesn't seem to DO anything. :)
13:18  gryllida: libreoffice would say, we are same code as openoffice but opensource. previous openoffice users would have 2 options, update to a closed product, or to same but open. many would choose open. the trademarks conflict is underway, maybe oracle sells the OO.o trademark to the libreoffice team and they would have it back.
13:18  gryllida: what do you want your plugin to do?
13:18  gryllida: and when.
13:19  denysonique: gryllida, ooo is becoming proprieshitary?
13:19  hiptobecubic: gryllida, no i understand how it works. But that's not the point. The point is that mom and pop and joe down the road are starting to get used to hearing about OOo. I've started seeing it installed on people's computers who aren't complete nerds.
13:20  gryllida: denysonique, oracle bought it. they're not willing to continue shipping future versions as open source. the oracle head openly said that open source approach fails in regards to market success.
13:20  denysonique: lol
13:20  denysonique: they fail
13:20  gryllida: yes.
13:20  gryllida: they do.
13:20  hiptobecubic: oracle's db is doing pretty well
13:20  hiptobecubic: not that i know shit about that
13:20  gryllida: You didn't really try it.
13:21  gryllida: You didn't compare...
13:21  hiptobecubic: gryllida, market share wise, not feature/functionality/reliability/etc/etc/etc
13:21  gryllida: ya
13:22  hiptobecubic: anyway. this plugin. I have a menu item that says "Your Menuitem" and it looks like it' suppsoed to be tied to a f() that pops up a javascript alert window, but I don't see it.
13:26  gryllida: did you zip your addon, put it somewhere, restart firefox?
13:27  hiptobecubic: I linked to my dev directory. The menu item shows up.
13:28  hiptobecubic: it's the boilerplate that mozilla gave with the 'add-on builder'
13:28  hiptobecubic: http://vpaste.net/dyqXa?ft=javascript
13:28  hiptobecubic: That should blank the page and write 'boobs' when it's clicked, no?
13:32  denysonique: hmm
13:32  denysonique: google recognises ff as firefox but not fx
13:33  hiptobecubic: it's ./chrome/content/overlay.js
13:34  denysonique: hmm

13:46  hiptobecubic: denysonique, so this function gets passed an event, which I assume has some information in it? Is there an api somewhere?

13:48  hiptobecubic: nope.

13:51  denysonique: :/
13:52  denysonique: I don't remember the add on compatibility about:config string
13:52  denysonique: for Fx 4b08
13:53  denysonique: that enable add-on compatiblity is too easy to click!
13:53  denysonique: I just clicked it by accident
13:59  hiptobecubic: denysonique, what do you think? Download the file to a temp dir and then open 'file:///.....' ?  Can i save the file in memory maybe and then just document.write() it?
14:00  denysonique: hiptobecubic, you can get it with ajax and then display
14:00  denysonique: hiptobecubic, or just override the headers
14:00  hiptobecubic: Right now my plugin changes the page title to 'boobs' and opens the link in a new tab.
14:00  hiptobecubic: :D
14:00  hiptobecubic: denysonique, override the headers? That sonuds like what I want. Is there a nice big list of functions etc somewhere?
14:01  denysonique: hiptobecubic, IDK
14:01  denysonique: do a google search

14:06  denysonique: if anyone knows please reply, I would like to get this indexed by google
14:06  denysonique: as it is hard to find the answer to this question
14:10  gryllida: hm
14:10  gryllida: wait
14:10  gryllida: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/15003/ does it

21:23 @kbrosnan: m0ar: might be possible, would need to strip out some of the image resources
21:24 @kbrosnan: the star and the favicon for example
21:27  m0ar: kbrosnan: They are gone a long time ago
21:27  asdfdsa: are there any proxy plugins for firefox 4 beta yet
21:27  m0ar: kbrosnan: I've got right/left arrows, adress bar, google bar.
21:28  m0ar: kbrosnan: No, just the adress bar and the arrows
21:28  m0ar: kbrosnan: That doesn't matter lol, how can I scale it down then? :)
21:29 @kbrosnan: the height of any images (buttons) in the toolbar and text height should influence the height of the addrss bar
21:29  m0ar: Oh
21:29  m0ar: Well, there is a small golden star in the adress bar, which obviously sucks
21:29  m0ar: Never use them so
