12:39  blablotin:   geeknik I do not have button to force it to check, and help-> check update have gone on firefox4.
12:40  geeknik: What operating system are you using?
12:40  blablotin: I am using linux porteus
12:41  geeknik: Never heard of it. If there is no check for updates button, you'll have to contact the people who created that distro and find out if they have an update available.
12:42  blablotin: thank you geeknik. will see when b10 will be released.

13:07  Dynetrekk: hi. firefox 4 beta: where do I enable the status line? I would like to see the URL of links when I hover my mouse over them. (btw: pentadactyl user with no address bar)
13:07  geeknik: there is no status bar in Firefox 4.
13:09  geeknik: you can always try https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/status-4-evar/
13:10  Dynetrekk: geeknik:  I don't really need a status bar as such. I just like to see the URL of the link I am clicking.
13:11  Dynetrekk: so if there's another way of doing that, I'd be happy
13:13  geeknik: Dynetrekk: I don't think I've seen an extension that does that.
13:13  Dynetrekk: heh, weird. it's really useful in some contexts, like when you get e-mail and want to verify that it's not spam
13:15  geeknik: ok, i think i found a couple.
13:15  geeknik: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-target-display/
13:16  geeknik: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/url-tooltip/
13:17  Dynetrekk: hey, thanks, good google-fu :)
13:17  geeknik: you're welcome. ;)
13:17  Dynetrekk: it'd be nice if firefox had this as a setting though. I really think this is an important, basic feature of a browser
13:18  Dynetrekk: anyway, I'm not switching browsers. firefox 4 beta looks good :)
13:18  geeknik: yeah, there has been quite a bit of unhappiness about the lack of a status bar. at the very least, i'd like to see a status bar like chrome's. is visible when you need it, out of the way when you don't. =)
13:19  Dynetrekk: geeknik: seeing the url would be enough for me. or disabling the status bar if you do not like it.
13:19 * geeknik nods.
13:19  Dynetrekk: although I guess it's nice that they made firefox faster ;)
13:20  Dynetrekk: maybe it helps to disable things like status bars

15:05  B_Lizzard: Hi, is the window caption thing supposed to show on Firefox 4 Beta 9 on Linux?
15:05  B_Lizzard: Isn't it supposed to be hidden with the window controls inline ala the Windows version?
15:26  ishigami: hi just a short question, i don't know if this is the right place to ask a question about problems with the firefox 4 beta 9 but i expect some weird "redraw" issues with the UI on mac os x 10.6.6 what can i do?

18:14  xingped: question: is there any way to prevent firefox from reloading a tab when you pull it out of the window away from other tabs?
18:16 @kbrosnan: it should not reload. though in 3.6 plugin state is not saved when dragging tabs. fixed in 4.0
18:41  tonsofpcs: Looking for a plugin, I think.  Here's what I want to do -- and why: (typing)
18:43  tonsofpcs: I have a large screen that is wider than it is tall.  I want to display an entire page that dynamically loads content (through AJAX or other means) as large as possible but is taller than it is wide.  Rather than "zooming out" so that it is 1/4 of my screen width or smaller, I want to split a browser window so that it is ~1/2 a screen width and the left side is at the top of the page (maybe with the ability to scroll) and the right 
18:45  tonsofpcs: The data is 'realtime' updated (it may only update once every minute but it updates the exact data at the point when it updates) so the page displayed has to be the same instance, not just a split window that is scrolled down and happens to have the same URL loaded

19:21  tonsofpcs: I cannot find one with search terms that seem relevant.  Was hoping maybe someone knew of one.
19:22  shadaloo: yo
19:22  shadaloo: my firefox just opened and all the saved tabs are gone (20+)
19:22  shadaloo: where is the cache of this?
19:22  tonsofpcs: aare you sure they were saved?
19:22  tonsofpcs: what OS?
19:23  shadaloo: of course I am sure
19:23  shadaloo: that's what firefox does
19:23  tonsofpcs: what's what firefox does?
19:23  shadaloo: tonsofpcs: /version shadaloo
19:24  tonsofpcs: shadaloo: that doesn't tell me what OS your firefox instance is running on.
19:24  shadaloo: this is ubuntu
19:27  shadaloo: wow
19:27  tonsofpcs: ~/.mozilla/firefox/
19:27  tonsofpcs: previous sessions are in [session name]/sessionstore*.js
19:28  tonsofpcs: prefs are in prefs*.js
19:28  tonsofpcs: etc.
19:28  tonsofpcs: you can dig around to try and find it, but if it didn't load _and your HDD isn't full_, it probably isn't saved.
19:28  shadaloo: excellent work
19:28  shadaloo: now how do I have firefox read that file
19:29  shadaloo: because like I said, this was 20+ tabs
19:29  shadaloo: a significant amount of work/information
19:30  tonsofpcs: firefox loads saved tabs when you start it.  If it didn't load when you started it, you likely either have a full HDD or didn't save the tabs.
19:31  shadaloo: wow
19:32  shadaloo: I used to think firefox was well written code
19:32  shadaloo: but apparently it's just garbage xD
19:32  shadaloo: fucking .js noless
19:34  tonsofpcs: I used to think that users had a clue, then I tried talking to them.

22:16  Migaaresno_: I have this in the head: <link href="feeds/human_rss.rss" type="application/rss+xml" rel="alternate"> I see a RSS in the url bar. If i press it, firefox will go to feed://http//localhost/feeds/human_rss.rss. As you can see, the url is totally invalid, and firefox cant find the rss feed. The correct url would be http://localhost/feeds/human_rss.rss. Is this a bug, or am i doing somthing wrong?
22:19  Cursarion: feed://http//localhost/feeds/human_rss.rss ..
22:23  geeknik: <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Title of RSS Feed" href="http://hostname/url/of/rss/feed" />
22:25  Migaaresno_: Yes, That would work. But.. well.. its a absolute link.
22:31  Migaaresno_: <link href="http://localhost/feeds/human_rss.rss" type="application/rss+xml" rel="alternate"> is not working. I looked a bit more and saw the error came from my internet providers proxy server.
22:31  Migaaresno_: I disabled the proxy and it worked again!
22:47  Migaaresno_: I wanted to file a bug report about the rss behind proxy, but it already exist: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367432
22:48  geeknik: doesn't look like it is going to get fixed anytime soon or even at all. best you can do is vote for it https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/votes.cgi?action=show_user&bug_id=367432#vote_367432
22:48  geeknik: unless you have new information that could cause it to get fixed faster.
