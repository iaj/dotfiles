15:15  c3l: Im on linux (ubuntu), how can I run firefox in two or more instances in different processes? ie I open two firefox windows, and they have nothing to do with each other, if one crashes, the other one's still alive. or using private browsing on one of them and not the other. is this possible?

17:34  DarkUranium: hey, can someone give me a hand here?
17:35  DarkUranium: why would Firefox read an otherwise perfectly fine CSS file as a bunch of chinese gibberish (literally, chinese characters)
17:35  DarkUranium: I have it linked via <link rel ... />
17:36 @kbrosnan: sever sending the file with utf-16 mime type?
17:36  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: it's file://
17:36  DarkUranium: or ///
17:37  DarkUranium: yeah, I figured it may be reading it as UTF-16, but why?
17:37  DarkUranium: I did save it with the same editor as the HTML file (vim)
17:38  teliti: Hello. Is it possible to tell firefox not to notify me when I'm missing a plugin?
17:39  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: so er, any idea what to do about this? =/
17:40 @kbrosnan: teliti: yes, about:config
17:41  teliti: kbrosnan: thank you. I think I found it :-)
17:43  teliti: kbrosnan: sorry, I have to ask once more ... which variable do I have to disable?
17:44 @kbrosnan: sec
17:47  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: ideas? =/
17:47  DarkUranium: I need this solved in order to get the univ assignment done
17:48 @kbrosnan: teliti: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Disabling_yellow_plugin_bar_-_Firefox
17:50  teliti: thank you again. Now it works!
17:54 @kbrosnan: DarkUranium: things tend to act oddly when accessed from a file uri
17:54  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: well, it wasn't a file URI
17:54  DarkUranium: it's just a relative href="style.css"
17:54 @kbrosnan: file:///
17:55  DarkUranium: kbrosnan: the HTML is, yes
17:55 @kbrosnan: means you are not using a web server
17:55  DarkUranium: nope, because I don't need one for this
17:55  DarkUranium: it's just HTML w/ CSS
17:56  DarkUranium: ah, I think I found the problem
17:56  DarkUranium: it's the HTML
17:56  DarkUranium: the professor who provided the source seems to have saved it as utf-16
17:59  DarkUranium: okay, it works now =)
17:59  DarkUranium: Firefox (righfully) assumed that the CSS was UTF-16 as well
18:00  DarkUranium: and Vim naturally saved in UTF-8 (or the ASCII subset in this case -- there were no non-ascii chars in there)
18:07  jsmartin_: i have an odd issue with firefox.  I use what is called proxychains to run firefox when i need to access a site that uses a socks server to connect to it.  Basically when i need to connect to an HMC for a customer i have to do this.
18:07  jsmartin_: When i first started using proxychains for firefox it worked...until i logged out
18:08  jsmartin_: then when i log back in it doesnt use it...i can type proxychains firefox and it will launch firefox but not even try to use proxychains
18:08  jsmartin_: if i remove .mozilla and then try
18:08  jsmartin_: it works
18:08  jsmartin_: however log back out and back in and it wont work
18:08  jsmartin_: im not wanting you to troubleshoot proxychains
18:08  jsmartin_: but im wondering if firefox has something that disables using it
18:12 --- jsmartin_ is now known as jeremym
18:16  jeremym: i hope someone has an idea for this :)
18:24  jeremym: it works every time if i start it up like this proxychains firefox -noremote
18:24  jeremym: so its something in the .mozilla directory doing it

18:30  leo2007: hello folks, how to get a good dark theme for all sites in firefox?
18:47  Vilkku: hello guys, in firefox 4, is it possible to make app tabs save between sessions even if I normally don't save my session?
19:41  MxReb0: I saw beta 8 is out, but in beta 7, help > about > check for updates doesn't find anything. Does this normally take awhile or do I need to manually dl?
20:16  sdwilsh: that would be because beta 8 isn't out yet
20:17  sdwilsh: some news sites jumped the gun because they saw builds up on ftp
20:17  sdwilsh: this is a common problem

20:45  Grievre: does anyone know a good way to wipe firefox's bookmarks in windows?
20:45  Grievre: In an automated fashion
20:46  Grievre: I've tried deleting bookmarks.html and bookmark backups but the bookmarks remain
20:46 @kbrosnan: Firefox does not use bookmarks.html any more
20:46 @kbrosnan: places.sqlite has bookmarks and history
20:47  Grievre: oh I see
20:47  Grievre: using sqlite databases makes external manipulation a little bit more irritating :/
20:50  Grievre: kbrosnan: Is there a page that describes what's stored where?
20:51 @kbrosnan: https://wiki.mozilla.org/File:Places.sqlite.schema.pdf might be out of date though
20:54 @kbrosnan: you will also find the file locked when firefox is running
