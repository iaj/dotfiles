00:10  Kerrick: I'm having some weird behavior in Firefox. My setup: I have a Wordpress website with one secure page. In order to make the page secure, I used Apache mod_rewrite to cause requests to the unencrypted version of the page to redirect to the encrypted version of the page. It works most of the time, but sometimes Firefox loads a script insecurely before even requesting the unsecure version of the page. Chrome does not exhibit this behavior. What cause
00:10  Kerrick: s this?
00:12  Kerrick: The script does not appear to be used on the page in question.

00:21 @kbrosnan: is it always the same file that is not sent over https: or is something fetched from the cache? making sure every resource on the page is using sent with no-cache
00:22 @kbrosnan: though i'm heading out for dinner will check back later
00:25  Kerrick: OK
00:25  Kerrick: Lemme check some stuff

04:40  allan8904: hey, is there anyway to disable rightclicking in firefox?
04:57  Datz: hi, since when does firefox do a google lucky search when you enter a word into the address bar?
04:58  Datz: kinda neato
05:00  Datz: someone else says their version does a regular google search
05:09  andy_t_roo: Hello, is it possible to tell which plugin / addon is causing fx to use lots of cpu? -- i have a duel core machine and fx is using 100% of 1 cpu and is poorly responsive (seconds to respond to any click, even going to another already open tab, or scrolling the current window)
05:09  andy_t_roo: i believe the problem started when i opened a page which had a shockwave plugin,  but fx pluginContainer currently has 0% cpu usage.
05:11  andy_t_roo: (latest stable fx, win xp)
05:12  andy_t_roo: cpu usage is wutgub a thread from firefox.exe+0x1840

08:34  Xapti: hi i'm wondering how I can get everyting to open in a new window instead of a new tab
08:35  Xapti: some things like middle-clicking a link, or selecting "google search for..." from the right click menu
08:35  Xapti: seem to always open in a new tab
08:41  andy_t_roo1: Xapti: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction
08:42  Xapti: yeah i just found that and am seeing if changing it from 2 to 0 helps
08:44  Xapti: didn't work
08:46  andy_t_roo1: Xapti: if its just searching ; browser. search. openintab ?
08:46  andy_t_roo1: i don't know what that does though
08:53  Xapti: i already saw that setting and it was already on false
08:53  Xapti: I assume if it was on true that it would open search results in a new tab if you used the search toolbar
08:54  Xapti: it should be named browser.searchtoolbar.openintab IMO (assuming that's what it does)
09:03  Stummi: where can i advise an attacking website?

20:11  ScottO_: how can i see what resources are being encrupted and which are not in the situation where the page is 'partially Encrypted' ?
20:12  geeknik: ScottO_: what version of Firefox are you using?
20:12  ScottO_: 3.6.10
20:13  ScottO_: ah nm i see it under 'media'
20:14  geeknik: Yeah. Was just getting ready to say that. Also, you should upgrade to 3.6.12 as soon as possible. Security issues and all. ;)
20:14  ScottO_: yeah i know
20:14  ScottO_: ive had multiple version which will not auto update
20:14  ScottO_: for some reason they are all getting stuck on downloading
20:14  ScottO_: is that a known issue?
20:14  geeknik: let me look.
20:15  ScottO_: cause if i have auto update on, it should be updating itself
20:15  ScottO_: it just hangs on 'Connecting to the update server...'
20:16  ScottO_: and thats on 3.6.11, but i had a 3.6.8 that was havign other update issues, which prompted me to manually download a new version and install iot
20:17  geeknik: I don't see anything in bugzilla.
20:17  ScottO_: weird
20:17  ScottO_: people wont get the newset ersions of the updates fail :P
20:17 * geeknik nods.
20:19  geeknik: You might go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ and file a bug on this issue. If it is new, cool, if it gets duped to another bug, at least you'll have something to go on.
20:19  geeknik: But give me the bug # after you do that, and I'll mark it NEW so it gets the right attention. =)
20:21  ScottO_: i honestly dont know how to replicate it
20:21  ScottO_: and im lacking enough details to file a bug
20:22  ScottO_: i just know 'its happened a few times'
20:22  ScottO_: :P
20:23  geeknik: Yeah.
20:23  geeknik: I've filed a few bugs like that over the past few years.. They usually end up fixing themselves.

20:37  dark3lf: Hello there, I am looking for firefox portable edition for linux
20:38  dark3lf: I tried to find it but I only found some unofficial editions
20:38  dark3lf: I want to put it on a usb stick
20:46  geeknik: dark: As far as I know, there is not an official portable edition of Firefox that Mozilla releases. I did find a shell script that might help you though.
20:46  geeknik: nevermind.
20:48  xangua: there is portableapps
20:48  geeknik: xangua: For Windows.
20:48  xangua: yes
20:48  xangua: portableapps.com
20:48  geeknik: He wanted Linux. =)
20:49  xangua: aah there is also
20:49  xangua: i just don't remember the name
20:49  geeknik: https://www.privacyfoundation.de/wiki/PortableLinuxApps has a script that will download the latest Firefox release for Linux and make it portable.
21:10  sparr: I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.10 and am running Firefox. When I open a new instance of Firefox, or at random while using an existing instance, my address bar will lose the awesomebar/autocomplete functionality (despite my History being intact) and it will lag behind my keystrokes and even skip keystrokes at random. Suggestions?
