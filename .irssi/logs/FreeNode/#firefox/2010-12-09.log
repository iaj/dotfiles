08:27  LumberCartel: Hello folks.  How does one enter an IPv6 address for the POP3 server host in Thunderbird?  I'm using 3.1.1 and have tried with and without square brackets around the address, but Thunderbird just tries to resolve these as hostnames.  Thanks in advance.

11:42  AdvoWork: using ubuntu, 6.06 and im using firefox 3.05, the check for updates button is disabled, so i cant update. i dont want to use ubuntu's version, is there any way to update the firefox version?
11:43  moo_: AdvoWork: you can install and download a secondary Firefox copy which is not installed through Ubuntu package manager
11:44  moo_: AdvoWork: getfirefox.com
11:44  Cork: AdvoWork: you can't update, but you can install along side
11:44  moo_: AdvoWork: though ubuntu 6.06 is already four years old and not offically supported any more, so I cannot guarantee it will run
11:45  Cork: AdvoWork: just grab the tar.bz2 and extract it
11:51  AdvoWork: Cork, so the new firefox version would run along side 3.05?
11:51  Cork: i think any up to and including 4.0 should work
11:52  AdvoWork: ok, so after ive extracted it, how easy is it to install?
11:52  Cork: AdvoWork: exctact it in /var/local/firefox
11:53  Cork: make a sym link in /var/local/bin ; that is ln -s /var/local/firefox/firefox (in that folder)
11:53  Cork: add a sym link for the plugin folder in your firefox map
11:53  Cork: and your done
11:55  Cork: AdvoWork: sorry you sould extract it in /var/local/lib/firefox
11:55  Cork: forgot the lib folder >_<'
