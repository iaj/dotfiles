02:38  BarkingFish: Morning all :)
02:38  BarkingFish: Whoever coded firefox's error messages, you're a genius :)
02:38  BarkingFish: Anyone know how to deal with the "Well, this is embarrassing" one?  How do I get the tabs not to reopen?

03:45  rryouumaa: is there a way to extract a single folder of bookmarks into a simple list of url and title?
03:46  rryouumaa: i would use copy all urls instead, but it does not operate well with bar tab.  bookmarks should have all the information there.  i'd run a little sqlite script if somebody would show me how.
03:46  rryouumaa: i always just want the latest folder within another folder, though

16:42  physically_fit: i can't update versions 3.6 and 4.0
16:42  physically_fit: what's happening?
16:43  Tannerbaum: 4.0 isn't released yet, it's in beta
16:43  Tannerbaum: you need to download it from mozilla
16:43 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 83 seconds
16:43  physically_fit: but i've been updating 4.0 since forever
16:43  Tannerbaum: are you sure?
16:43  physically_fit: yep
16:44  Tannerbaum: define forever
16:44  physically_fit: since it was released as beta
16:44  physically_fit: and what about 3.6?
16:47  physically_fit: my source is: http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-daily/ppa/ubuntu
16:50  mynameisdeleted: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
16:50  mynameisdeleted: I guess most major advertisers and comercial sites dont beleive that set of stats
16:50  mynameisdeleted: and use other sources
16:50  mynameisdeleted: but how long do you think till that site says ie is under 20% and thus a minority browser?
16:51  physically_fit: that site is mostly visited by tech-wised people, so it's not a "reliable" source
16:52  mynameisdeleted: in 2003 ie was 87.7 there and now its 29.7
16:52  physically_fit: techies don't use IE, those statistics are based on thier visitors, right?
16:53  mynameisdeleted: I'm just wondering when tech sites will be able to ignore ie
16:53  physically_fit: ^_^ hehe i solved my firefox problem. thanks for your help Tannerbaum
16:53  mynameisdeleted: the way no-tech ones did to firefox for the early 2000's
16:53  mynameisdeleted: everyone who learns programming or whatever MUST drop ie
16:53  mynameisdeleted: even if they only take 1 class in computing for college
16:53  mynameisdeleted: or highschool
16:54  mynameisdeleted: I think that woudl require tech sites to have under 10% ie
16:56  mynameisdeleted: basically Id liek to see ie treated there teh way they treat opera
16:56  mynameisdeleted: if its tons of work to adapt to make somethign work in it they post message to use another browser
16:57  mynameisdeleted: actually IE5, 6, 7, and 9 are all lower than 10%
16:58  mynameisdeleted: just not 8
17:02  comawhite: on http://www.mozilla.com/en-GB/mobile/ I tried installing it on the n900, but the link gives a 404

20:13  sresu: on fire fox i get unable to connect
21:04  SP1: hi all im havinbg problems with the newest version of firefox anbd would appreciate any help i can get
21:19  gammy: Why is it in firefox 3.6.3 that selecting "Allow all pages to choose their own colors" disables all image support?
21:19  gammy: Sorry; I mean the reverse; -deselecting- that option.
21:21  SP1: no idea sorry
21:21  gammy: ok, not all. About 99% :P
21:23  gammy: Does this simply disable any CSS which contains an image?
21:23  gammy: ie it disables all css styles?
21:37  gammy: Ah, how informative, I see.
21:37  gammy: Thanks for the great help!
21:50  foss: any firefox developers here?
21:50  foss: i have a project if anyone is interested
21:51 @Peng: Probably not, but go on.
21:52  foss: what languages are used to create firefox plugins/extensions?
21:52  Cork[home]: xul+js+css
21:53  Cork[home]: so its almost like writing a webpage
21:53  foss: like if i want to have a plugin that alters the way visitors see a certain page
21:53  foss: that would be an extension right
21:54  foss: i meant that would be possible right
21:54  Cork[home]: foss: plugins is compiled binaries
21:54  Cork[home]: extensions is what i talked about
21:54  foss: so for something like what i want to do, is that an extension or plugin?
21:55  Cork[home]: foss: yes its posible, but i don't really see why you would have to write that as an extension
21:55  Cork[home]: use something like userscript.org
21:55  Cork[home]: or stylish
21:55  Cork[home]: (greasemonkey == userscript.org)
21:55  foss: not for me
21:56  foss: basically what people would be able to do is download themes to use on social networks using the extension
21:56  Cork[home]: foss: that is stylish in a nut case...
21:57  foss: ive never heard of stylish
21:57  foss: okay if i want to create something like that lets say
21:57  Cork[home]: https://addons.mozilla.org/sv-se/firefox/addon/2108/
21:57  foss: yeah i googled it
21:58  foss: so i want to have something like that created
21:59  Cork[home]: foss: well you can tale stylish as a base and start reding at https://developer.mozilla.org/En/XUL
21:59  foss: so that uses xul,js,css?
22:00  Cork[home]: tale==take
22:00  foss: im not a programmer i was looking to hire someone.. i went on the mozilla developers thing and signed up and sent out an email
22:00  foss: i got few responses but they charge ridiculous amount per hour
22:01  Cork[home]: foss: well i don't think your going to find anyone here that has time to spare
22:01  foss: well just so i know i wont get screwed. how many hours do you think something like a very basic of that would take
22:02  Cork[home]: foss: thats imposible to say
22:02  Cork[home]: foss: it all depens on what you want integrated into it for sharing things, how the interface should work and so on
22:02  foss: oh
22:03  Cork[home]: foss: the basics for the css is already inside firefox (userContent.css) so ...
22:03  Cork[home]: but giving it a time is hard
22:03  foss: so if i wanted to for now just make it so it works for only facebook
22:03  foss: that would cut down on development time i assume
22:04  Cork[home]: foss: what cuts things down in development time is that firefox is built in css and js
22:04  Cork[home]: foss: so all the basis is native to the language
22:05  Cork[home]: foss: what takes time is the gui, comunity interaction, and security (not to let the site assess privileged code)
22:05  foss: oh
22:05  foss: the gui is built using html, js, etc/
22:06  Cork[home]: foss: but as i said, i don't really see why you would have to invent the weel again...
22:06  Cork[home]: its all there (except the comunity integration) in stylish
22:06  Cork[home]: foss: no i meant the gui for the extension
22:06  foss: how is that built?
22:07  Cork[home]: i already told you, xul
22:07  Cork[home]: if you mean how is it compiled; the answer is: it isn't
22:08  Cork[home]: extensions is stored in xpi files but thats actually only a zip file
22:08  foss: no the gui
22:09  Cork[home]: foss: the gui of the extension is xul, the design of the gui is css, the actions of the gui is js
22:09  foss: oh ok
