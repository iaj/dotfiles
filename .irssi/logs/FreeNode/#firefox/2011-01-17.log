00:52  waclaw: chrome_: Try Greasemonkey (I understand you want to see some content automatically added on your machine when you visit certain pages)

03:05  xbskid: Is Undo Close Tab supposed to close every other tab in the tab bar?
03:05  xbskid: Because on 4.0b9 it is.
03:05  xbskid: Ohwait, I get it.
03:06  xbskid: It's unopening the tabs into additional tab groups.
03:07  xbskid: I hate to say it, but I think I prefer IE8's tab grouping functionality. Nothing's hidden, groups are clearly marked with colors.
03:08 @dolske: known bug, fixed a day or two after B9 shipped. Sorry. ;)

10:53  Gryllida: ?
10:53  jeybop: I quickly and nastly tried to add bootstrap install to my addon
10:53  jeybop: I dumbly add the line in install.rdf
10:53  Gryllida: unfortunately I didn't try that at all, try irc://irc.mozilla.org/extdev
10:54  jeybop: <em:bootstrap something...>
10:54  jeybop: thanks for the link
10:54  em: what should I bootstrap?
10:55  jeybop: excuse me em?
10:56  Ar-ras: Hi, is it allowed by the Mozilla License, to modify firefox by extensions and plugins so that it looks like another application. Binaries will be unchanger. I want to create a standalone CD for commercial use.
10:59  Ar-ras: Does somebody know?
10:59  silvery: He knows
10:59  silvery: (s)he knows
11:00  Gryllida: Ar-ras: http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html
11:00  phxheat: hi, if i install ff4-beta, does it overwrite my existing ff3 install or can i install it without messing with my ff3 (and able to run them both at once) ?
11:01  Gryllida: the latter, make a new profile though -- http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing+profiles -- they have different program dir but try to use same profile, so you have to make shortcuts manually (use -no-remote switch to run 2 profiles at a time)
11:01  silvery: Somebody, please tell me, do you have any information about Firefox 4b9 support for some (new?) CSS3 features, (i'm interested in scrollbar-*)?
11:02  Gryllida: silvery: install a nightly and see :) nightly.mozilla.org
11:02  Ar-ras: Gryllida I read this, but i dont understand it properly
11:04  Ar-ras: I just understand, it is important for mozilla corp. that the binaries are unchanged
11:05  silvery: Gryllida: Oh, I meant 4b10 (b9 console gives "unknown" as well) ))
11:06  Gryllida: Ar-ras: Iirc it's no commercial reuse, email licensing@mozilla.org  is in doubt
11:06  Gryllida: if in*
11:08  silvery: the problem is in that if you put it in body or into script, that should generate body, it is not recognized... in any other cases it works fine... any ideas on why such happening?
11:09  Gryllida: silvery: One important thing you must know about a colored scrollbar is that it does not do not work in Gecko-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape Navigator, Mozilla): It is an Internet Explorer's only property. It is not a standard property or a proprietary property. According to W3C, these properties are illegal: they are neither defined in any CSS specification nor are they marked as proprietary (by prefixing them with "-vendor-"). http://www.websawar
11:09  Gryllida: silvery: but where did you get it is css3 part though?
11:12  silvery: Gryllida: It appears, that I've been ducked by some geeks of mine)))
11:13  Gryllida: appears what?
11:14  Ar-ras: Gryllida you mean, what i do is not commercial reuse? or no commercial reuse is allowed
11:14  silvery: It appears that I must thank you and say sorry for missinformation...(((
11:15  Aperculum: my firefox won't start and it doesn't even give any error messages

11:16  Aperculum: nope, -safe-mode and profile manager won't start either
11:16  Aperculum: I tried all the normal tricks

11:18  Gryllida: Aperculum: What distro btw?

11:21  Gryllida: silvery: ask #ubuntu-mozillateam , you need to add a repo
11:21  Gryllida: idk how
11:22  jeybop: actually, it seems it is all my addon manager which is crashed
11:22  silvery: Gryllida: do you know the name of this repo(link)?

11:28  jeybop: ok ok
11:28  Gryllida: make a new profile then, jeybop

17:04  Gyndawyr: hello there
17:05  Gyndawyr: I would like to set the mozilla firefox upload location to my desktop
17:05  Gyndawyr: how do?
17:06  Gyndawyr: it remembered the last place I browsed for a file and later on my mother used the computer and being heavily religious, she did not appreciate the adult nature of the content she found accidentally
17:06  Gyndawyr: I'd like to make sure it does not remember the previous location
17:09  Cursarion: I'm not sure about that, but I'd suggest you use different profiles
17:10  Cursarion: helps if you forget to delete all visited websites etc.
17:11  Gyndawyr: I don't forget about visited websites, because when I close firefox it forgets them. I use KeePass to enter most details online. The problem is firefox remembering filepaths
17:11  Gyndawyr: can I do something about that?
17:12  Cursarion: a profile remembers only one filepath or so
17:12  Cursarion: that's why I suggested another profile
17:13  Cursarion: other way to avoid situations would be to save something to desktop everytime you quit
17:13  Cursarion: or use a temporary folder with everything
17:14  Gyndawyr: so there is no setting to get it to remember to look in the desktop
17:15  nhi: hi, is there any way to give "live bookmarks" aka rss feeds
17:15  nhi: favicons in firefox 4?
17:17  Cursarion: Gyndawyr: I've never seen one in the GUI options/preferences, but there may be one in the hidden settings
17:18  Cursarion: I personally am quite annoyed with the Ctrl-Q hotkey
17:18  Cursarion: next to Ctrl-W it's easy to accidentally close the browser instead of a tab
17:18  Cursarion: that key binding is also stored someplace hidden -.-

22:58  satdav: amh345: what page url
22:58  amh345: satdav: it's on an internal development server :(
22:58  satdav: can you do a screen shot of the error
23:00  amh345: satdav: firebug says "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://some_site:3000/images/index_13.jpg"   and my base href is <base href= "http://some_site:3000/data/S2/html/images"/>  this happens for all the images.
23:00  sideone: hey all.. b9 is impressive
23:00  satdav: Pilif12p: ^
23:00  satdav: should we try safe mode
23:01  sideone: does anyone know how to pin the 'list all tabs' options to a sidebar? kind of like treestyle tabs
23:01  sideone: also, is there a google bookmarks that works with b9?
23:05  satdav: sideone: can you check out addons.mozilla.org for the google bookmarks question it should be on their
23:05 @kbrosnan: sideone: the treestyle tabs extension would be your best bet. doubtful on google bookmarks the extension contains binary components they need to be updated for major versions
23:07  sideone: google toolbar works..
23:08  sideone: treestyle isnt compatible w/b9.. :(
23:12 @kbrosnan: try the add-on compatabilty reporter extension to see if they work. recommend checking the developers website for any beta releases.
23:13  pcard: satdav: yahoo groups appears to still be a closed group system, and not a Usenet archive
23:13  pcard: thanks though
23:14  satdav: use google for it
