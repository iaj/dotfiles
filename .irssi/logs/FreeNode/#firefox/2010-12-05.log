00:46  andr3: Anyone around here with the Mozilla labs team?
00:48  andr3: i had a question about the Mozilla Open Data Visualization Competition... the dataset of the browser UI has a "close tab" on the keyboard shortcuts, but there is no "close button" on the tab itself. does the "close tab" on the keyboard shortcut includes all possible ways to close a tab?

12:22  Linuxsapien: im having a menu font issue, can I send someone a screenshot?
12:37  muenchhausen: Hi there. How can I tell firefox to download .ogg files instead of trying to play them?
12:37  muenchhausen: they don't show up in the 'applications' tab and I can't add anything there manually
12:50  smarn: everytime navigation bar hides .. i press alt it shows..when i click and try to type anything it hides what to do ?
12:50  smarn: on firefox 4 beta 7
12:58 @gavin: smarn: sounds like you have your location bar customized onto the menu bar...
12:58 @gavin: the menu bar is the only toolbar that behaves that way
12:59 @gavin: View-Toolbars->Customize and "Restore Default Set" can reset them
13:01  smarn: true.. i installed firefox 4 on the latest one .. thanks , now it works
13:26  muenchhausen: so is just downloading .ogg files instead of playing them impossible?
13:30  Cork[home]: muenchhausen: if you open the file in its own tab, you can go file save page
13:30  muenchhausen: I found media.ogg.enabled in about:config but turning it to false results in nothing happening at all when I open a link to a .ogg file
13:30  Cork[home]: * file > save page...
13:31  muenchhausen: ok, thanks, that's slightly more convenient than right-clicking on the player, navigating through the menu and saving from there
13:32  muenchhausen: it would be nice if it could behave the same way as with .mp3 files
13:33  muenchhausen: if I could tell FF to download as default action
13:34  muenchhausen: because in-browser playback makes little sense in my case, since FF uses the wrong soundserver/audio interface
13:36  muenchhausen: and there seems to be no way to configure audio

18:34 @kbrosnan: if you need some extensions you should check toe see if they have updates for Firefox 4
18:45  avalon: kbrosnan, well, I don' t really need any extensions. I was just worried on getting problems like memory leaking or something serious..

21:00  xangua: nop
21:01  xangua: catphish: that's the normal behavior, you only get what you said when you have download statusbar installed, or maybe other addon
21:01 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 128 seconds
21:03  catphish: so by default, the application should remain running?
21:03  catphish: i think the download statusbar is part of the Ubuntu firefox modifications
21:05  catphish: still happens with the ubuntu addons disabled :(
