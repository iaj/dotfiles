02:52  biopyte: in which file/folder is the bookmark data stored on a linux system
02:52  biopyte: ?
02:53  biopyte: i have to edit the raw data
02:53  biopyte: bookmark manager is not what i want
02:54 @kbrosnan: you would need to understand the boomkark schema and sqlite
02:55  biopyte: kbrosnan, the bookmark data is not stores in a plain human readable text file/
02:55  biopyte: ?
02:55 @kbrosnan: it is stored in a sqlite database
02:56  biopyte: i see
02:56  biopyte: thats making things difficult
02:57  biopyte: i want to rename 50 bookmarks that currently have all the same name
02:58  biopyte: kbrosnan, whats the name of the sqlite file
02:58 @kbrosnan: places
02:58  biopyte: ?
02:59  biopyte: thanks
03:49  biopyte: i have a text file with 50 rows. every row holds a name and a url, like "Joe www.joe.com". How can i paste this information at once into a  bookmark folder?
03:50  biopyte: import bookmarks as plain text, somehow

05:16  bamccaig: I'm trying to disable searching (or any interpretation) of the address bar. That annoys me to no end. As a power user, I know what I asked for and prefer an HTTP 500 to search results that I don't want.
05:16  bamccaig: Anybody know how to disable this? v3.6.13
05:17 @kbrosnan: about:config keyword.url.enable
05:17  bamccaig: I've set keyword.enabled to false and browser.fixup.alternate.enabled to false. Typing 'foobar' in the location bar still gives me Google search results for 'foobar'. >:(
05:18  bamccaig: There is no keyword.url.enabled. Though I've also set keyword.URL to the empty string. :\
05:18 @kbrosnan: possible that your isp does some dns redirecting
05:18  bamccaig: :(
05:20  bamccaig: If that were the case shouldn't I get similar results with other browsers (i.e., links, Konquerer)?
05:21  bamccaig: (Unsurprisingly Chrome does the same thing)
05:21  bamccaig: Sigh.....
05:21 @kbrosnan: i said it was a possibility. but if other browsers are not seeing that then probably not
05:22  bamccaig: Well, the ISP could theoretically be sniffing the user agent out of the HTTP and only reacting to known agents... In theory.
05:22  bamccaig: It seems I have disabled the features in Firefox... Don't know why it's still doing it.
05:23  bamccaig: Thanks anyway. :(
05:26  bamccaig: Perhaps it is Vimperator's fault. I'm not sure...
05:29  bamccaig: Apparently it was. To fix it I had to do :set defsearch=

10:02  hannes|: How could I add another search engine to the right-click menu when I've marked some text I'd like to search
10:02  hannes|: At the moment only google appears but I would like to add scholar to it, too
10:07  geeknik: hannes|: add scholar to the search box in firefox, and then select it and when you right click something, it will use scholar. if you change the search box, it will change the right click search engine as well.
10:07  hannes|: geeknik, ok so there is no way to have a selection in the right-click menu?
10:07  hannes|: but thanks anyway
10:08  geeknik: There is an extension called Context Search, you can try that.
10:08  geeknik: not sure it's been updated to work with 3.6 or 4.0 though.
10:08  hannes|: geeknik, great thanks
10:08  geeknik: you're welcome.
11:55  simion314: how do you forece firefox  to  reload all the page from the server not from the cache?(page content css )
12:08  nutshell42: hi, does firefox have a boot log somewhere? The thing hangs on launch before the windows appear
12:24  nutshell42: I just tried a new profile with a new user as well as safe mode and all plugins and extensions disabled and it's the same
12:24  nutshell42: so the fuckup is on firefox' side
12:24  nutshell42: from timing and delay I'd say it tries to write to a file it doesn't have access for and waits for the timeout
12:24  nutshell42: smplayer had a similar problem
12:24  nutshell42: but that thing has a fscking log, where I could find that out

14:53  Gallop32: How can I stop Firefox from copying "meta data" when copying text? When I copy a text which has a TITLE or something in Firefox, both the text AND the title meta data is copied. How can I prevent this? I only want to copy what I actually see on the screen. I assume that there is some obscure configuration option to disable this…
14:53 @kbrosnan: disable flash
14:54 @kbrosnan: or http://daringfireball.net/2010/05/tynt_copy_paste_jerks
14:54  Gallop32: Has nothing to do with Flash.
14:54  Gallop32: Why are you talking about Flash?
14:55 @kbrosnan: thought you were describing the article above
14:56  Gallop32: It just copies the meta data.
14:56  Gallop32: I only wanna copy what I see
14:56 @kbrosnan: the simple way to avoid that is to paste into a program that only accepts plain text
14:57  Gallop32: Huh?
14:57  Gallop32: It IS plain text.
14:57  Gallop32: Firefox ADDS stuff to the text.
14:57 @kbrosnan: firefox copies the html
14:57  Gallop32: <P>blablabl<SPAN TITLE="BLABLABLA">abl</SPAN>abla</P>
14:57  Gallop32: I don't wanna fucking copy the HTML.
14:57  Gallop32: I wanna copy the text that is displayed on the page.
14:57  Gallop32: Nothing else.
14:57  Gallop32: Not the title in the span.
14:58  Gallop32: Like all other browsers do.
14:58  Gallop32: In fact, like all other softwares ever do?

16:19  sione: hello, i just tried firefox beta - le last one, and i want to know if there is a way to put tabs beside the orange menu button - like google chrome ?
16:20  sione: tabs in the title bar
16:27 --- boonhead is now known as bh-off
16:29 @kbrosnan: sione: next beta they will do that when the window is maximized. when not there needs to be some space to drag the window around by
16:30  sione: kbrosnan, perfect ! yeah when not maximized its like google chrome as well
18:08  bencahill: hey, are there any plugins that will prevent duplicate tabs (urls)?

19:21  Solskogen: hi! I have a problem with the latest firefox beta (4.0b8) and java on mac. Applets wont show even if the java plugin is shown in about:config
19:22  Solskogen: the java applet loads with safari, so it probably not the sites fault ;-)

20:07  byte_bucket: Anyone happen to know where untrused CAs are show in the certificate manager interface ?
20:08 @kbrosnan: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options%20window%20-%20Advanced%20panel#w_encryption-tab
20:14  byte_bucket: kbrosnan: when downloading/installing certs, the following indicates that  subsequent certs in a chain will be stored as "untrusted CA certificates to the local database".  I dont see anything in the UI that specifically identifies "untrusted CAs".  https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Certificate_Download_Specification
20:15 @kbrosnan: the servers tab would have untrusted certs that you have approved to be stored for future use
20:16  byte_bucket: kbrosnan: When I send a cert chain, I see the CA as a root node in the tree under "personal" but I cannot select it specifically.  I dont see it listed in servers
20:16 @kbrosnan: are you adding a full CA to approve certs or just one server?
20:17  byte_bucket: full CA
20:18  byte_bucket: I have two certs in the chain, the first is a user cert and the second is the ca that signed it

20:27 @kbrosnan: byte_bucket: then it should show up on the authorites list
20:31  byte_bucket: kbrosnan: not there either. as I said, it only shows as a root node on the personal tab
20:31  byte_bucket: kbrosnan: is there a config setting or something I can set to make the cert manager show more info ?
20:32 @kbrosnan: when i add cacert for example to firefox it is added to the auth tab
