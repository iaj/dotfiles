22:14  Adolar: Hello, sor 3 days I have problems using Firefox showing videolists on Youtube. I have AddBlockPlus, firebug, NoScript(not activated), FlagFox, BetterPrivacy and Greasemonkey. The Problem is on W7, Ubuntu10.10 and MacOSX. What could be the problem?
22:15  Adolar: Videos are playable but all dynamic forced features on Youtube-site doesn't work.
22:15  Adolar: That means Javascript. That's an Youtube malfunction only.

23:16  Lars_G: Hi all.
23:18  Lars_G: I'm trying to use a specific version of the java plugin I downloaded (bank insists I need it). so I installed the JRE to my home dir, and symlinked libjavaplugin_oji.so from the plugin/i386/ns7 directory to my generic /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins directory... but firefox is not recognizing the plugin, whereas if I symlink (or use alternatives) the icedtea6 or the system's sun jre plugin, it's recognized.
23:18  Lars_G: any ideas?
