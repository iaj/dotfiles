10:09  Level1: Is this the right channel to discuss beta issues?
10:10  joako: Sure! What's yours? Mine seems to have major issues with flash and the security warnings are still annoying as hell
10:13  Level1: I'm having trouble with tabs.  I like my tabs on the left side, in a stack.  I use the tree style tabs extension to do this, but the problem is that the close buttons on the tabs disappear when I do this.  I can't find any way, such as an extension, to close a tab without using a context menu or a keyboard shortcut.
10:19  joako: No idea... the only addon I use is ABP and it works

16:52  mynameisdeleted: according to w3schools browser stats, 0.6% of the browser os's arent in the stats, I.E. arent in windows vista, 7, 2003, xp or 2000, and arent linux and arent mac
16:52  mynameisdeleted: I wonder how much of that is ipad or smartphone or somethign?
16:53  mynameisdeleted: what percentage of web uses mobile devices?
16:54  steffen123__: mynameisdeleted: it really depends on what statistic you use ;)
16:55  mynameisdeleted: I read an article on whether mobile internet wil overtake fixed internet
16:55  mynameisdeleted: is there possible truth in that?
16:58  mynameisdeleted: I think its improbable in the next 3 years
16:58  mynameisdeleted: but any major project or company shoudl be lookin gfurther than that
17:00  steffen123__: well i think its likely that mobile will overtake desktop internet sooner or later
17:00  steffen123__: but not in the next 3 years i agree
17:00  steffen123__: then again, people have been declaring the desktop dead for like a decade now
17:01  DiEOrLivE: Mozilla Firefox 4.0b7  very very nice good work! xD
17:03  steffen123__: also note that depending on how the statistics are made android may be counted as linux, and iphone may be counted as mac
17:21  kubanc: Why isn't my firefox displaying images, i checked "load images automaticly..."
18:48  ian_mac_: does anybody know if an add-on that allows you to forge requests?
18:50  ian_mac_: maybe that isn't correct terminology
18:50  ian_mac_: I want to be able to specify a set of cookies and post vars to send to a particular URL
18:50  ian_mac_: and see the results
