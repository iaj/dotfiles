16:11  noo: hello, is it possible to deny certain sites with firefox in a way such tht the user can't just enable them again? For example I can install the blocksite plugin, but the user can simply disable it....

16:47  saimon_: Hi...I'm having a really hard time trying to debug two very strange behaviours (ff 3.6.10, firebug 1.7X.0a3).
16:47  saimon_: 1. Ajax requests to my server are setup to be executed on a logrithmically longer and longer interval. The 'Accepts' header for these requests is set to 'application/json' as that's what the server understands and expects. Occasionally (and only in firefox), the 'Accepts' header is reset to the firefox default: 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8'. This causes the server to respond with a 406. In theory, the a
16:47  saimon_: callbacks should just handle the error case and the clock (interval callback) should just keep ticking, but for whatever reason, the interval no longer ticks, i.e. the interval callback is no longer called. No exceptions are thrown (I've tried to activate 'break on all errors' but it never does). In the firebug network panel, the request appears as 2 requests:  A request (with the correct Accepts header) appears as if it's waiting for a
16:47  saimon_: response from the server (i.e. loading indicator can be seen). Another request immediately below it with the default Accept's header, which is shown as completed with a 200 ok status. The server logs show that it returned a 406 Not Acceptable response.
16:49  saimon_: 2. If i shut down my server (to simulate network loss - I'm buliding an offline app), then firefox correctly handles the error condition but similarly to the previous case, the javascript interval that triggers the request then fails to keep ticking.
16:50  saimon_: I'm at a loss to explain either of these issues. I've been trying to step through the code with firebug's debugger and it all appears to go as expected but the timers mysteriously stop functioning.
16:53  saimon_: My code does have a clearInterval call but that's immediately followed by setting up the interval again...(i.e. it's there to reset the interval, each time the reset() method is called

17:05  saimon_: ok so I've just figured out what's up with the timers (not ff issue ofcourse)..
