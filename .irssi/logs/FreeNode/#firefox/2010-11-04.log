09:53  ch077179: I can't connect to google.com but intranet works, from commandline I can ping google.com, what could be wrong?

09:55  ch077179: also with ie I can load pages outside of the intranet..
09:56  geeknik: Make sure that File -> Work Offline is not checked.
09:57  ch077179: really weird, it was not checked
09:57  ch077179: now I checked it and it works???
09:58 * geeknik shrugs. As long as it works, right? =)
09:58  ch077179: somewhat counterintuitive...
10:00  ch077179: bah.. that's really bad. If work offline is checked I can browse google but not intranet, if unchecked I can't browse google but intranet
10:00  ch077179: does it have to do something with the update I just got?
10:02  geeknik: What version of Firefox are you running?
10:14  ch077179: 3.6.12 on win xp
10:22  geeknik: Shouldn't have anything to do with that version.
10:24  geeknik: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forums/contributors/534301 is a good article about troubleshooting connection problems effectively
10:37  ch077179: ty geeknik
10:37  geeknik: you're welcome.
10:40  ch077179: it was the firewall, I guess it is very sensitive about what version of programs to allow
10:40  geeknik: Yeah, some of those firewalls will block a program after an update because the checksum changes, etc.
11:41  cos^: hell, after upgrading from karmic to maverick all external links (such as irc links) are opened in a new window instead of new tab
11:41  cos^: s/hell/hello/ .
11:42  cos^: "open new windows in a new tab instead" is checked
11:45  cos^: wtf, new links are opened with "web browser 2.30.2" instead of firefox
11:46  cos^: problem solved, the default was changed without asking

15:38  snowcrash23: is there a way to force firefox to stay in fullscreen mode while watching a video? because I work in an other application and the first click always sets the video back to window-mode.
15:41  linuxguy101: snowcrash23: i think that is the players coding and not the browsers
