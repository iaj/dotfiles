17:01  Letterbomb05: Hi, how can I get Firefox to check my spelling as I write in a textbox? Other browsers will highlight spelling mistakes as I type (like in MS Word), however I'm not sure how to get Firefox to do this.
17:04  rjohnson19: Letterbomb05: um, it does already? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Using+the+spell+checker
17:05  Letterbomb05: Mine doesn't o.o
17:06  Letterbomb05: rjohnson19: http://img407.imageshack.us/i/probo.png/
17:07  rjohnson19: Letterbomb05: how about in a plain textarea? or maybe you are just not getting the red underline, try right clicking the words.

19:12  MaxFrames: hello
19:13  MaxFrames: when I open a particular website, Firefox (latest stable) says I'm missing this plugin: video/m4v
19:13  MaxFrames: it says that it's unknown, and won't let me install it automatically
19:13  MaxFrames: if I click on "install manually" it opens the quicktime webpage
19:14  MaxFrames: I have quicktime latest version and it's working, so I'm stuck
19:15  MaxFrames: same website opens fine in IE, and the thing which requires the codec is a quicktime video indeed
19:15 @kbrosnan: pastebin the contents of about:plugins
19:18  MaxFrames: can I pastebin an HTML page?
19:19  MaxFrames: http://pastebin.com/Mw5SDJbs => I hope it's readable
19:19  MaxFrames: the quicktime plugin seems OK
19:22 --- HarryS is now known as K-Lined
19:23 --- K-Lined is now known as HarryS
19:24 @kbrosnan: MaxFrames: looks like quicktime does not list that as one of the formats it supports.
19:24  coolguy4: I have this problem (on debian) where iceweasel sometimes slows down and doesn't respond for a couple of seconds, then afterwards it continues as if nothing had happened.
19:24  MaxFrames: but it does, because in IE the video plays in quicktime
19:24  MaxFrames: can I correct this?
19:24 @kbrosnan: there is no line for 'video/m4v' in quicktime's plugin
19:25 @kbrosnan: contact apple
19:27  MaxFrames: no way to add that line?
19:30 @kbrosnan: not really
19:30  MaxFrames: can you check out the site to see if it does the same? don't worry it's a safe site :)
19:30  MaxFrames: it's http://www.frettedamericana.com/
19:30  MaxFrames: a guitar site

19:37 @kbrosnan: MaxFrames: plays for me using quicktime
19:37  MaxFrames: FF and QT latest versions?
19:37 @kbrosnan: might try http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+troubleshooting
19:38 @kbrosnan: I'm heading out the door though.

20:37  subanomic: hi
20:38  subanomic: is there a way to disable the warnings for self-signed SSL certificates and just display them in the toolbar or so?
20:38  subanomic: so that i can easily access https links without having to download and accept the certificate manually
20:46 * sedulous also has a question regarding SSL certificates. Can I make Firefox let me know when a certificate changes, even when the new one is signed by an accepted CA?

20:55  sedulous: example: a law enforcement agency or your ISP might compromise your dedicated server, intercepting HTTPS connections and replacing the certificate with one that's signed by a trusted CA, which shouldn't be hard for governments
20:56  sedulous: forget about the compromise, they'd just need to intercept the traffic at an ISP level

22:35  Ginbuntu: can some one recommend me a firefox addon for easy bookmarks access? maybe a toolbar button when I click on it, it lists all my bookmarks?
22:35 --- Channel #firefox was synced in 73 seconds
22:38  geeknik: Ginbuntu: There is a button like that in Firefox 4 (Currently in Beta). =)
22:39  Ginbuntu: geeknik, mind to give me the link to ffox beta?
22:39  Ginbuntu: geeknik, Mozilla should inplemented this fetaure long ago
22:39  Ginbuntu: it saves a lot of time
22:39  geeknik: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/
22:39  geeknik: I think by Default the bookmark button in Firefox 4.0 Beta is to the right of the Search box, but you can move it wherever.
22:40  Ginbuntu: geeknik, is the beta stable enough for every day use?
22:40  Ginbuntu: or is it very unstable?
22:41  Ginbuntu: hey, firefox has a transparent UI nice, I love it
22:42  geeknik: I would say it is stable. You should create a new profile for it though. https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/managing+profiles
22:42  geeknik: And Beta 8 is coming soon.
22:42  geeknik: Er Beta 7.
22:44  Ginbuntu: the beta is a bit slow on my laptop
22:44  Ginbuntu: geeknik, the bookmarks button only open the panel,
22:44  Ginbuntu: I wanted something to give me a list of my bookmarks to chose from.
22:46  geeknik: turn on the bookmarks toolbar, there should be a button in that which says bookmarks next to it. if you click on that, it shows a drop down with your bookmarks in it.
23:27  glen1: hey

23:34  glen1: rjohnson19, why does firefox require you to add it as a book mark?
23:45  rjohnson19: glen1: ? it gives you the option to do other things, like add it to other feed reader programs
