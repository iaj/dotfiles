16:44  steffen123_: hi, I'm trying to find the list of the CAs that come with vanilla-firefox but my google searches dont produce anything useful, could someone point me in the right direction?
16:47 @kbrosnan: changes depending on the version of nss that ships with firefox
16:48 @kbrosnan: though here is a list of approved CAs https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=ttwCVzDVuWzZYaDosdU6e3w&single=true&gid=0&output=html
16:48  steffen123_: ah great, thanks
16:48 @kbrosnan: there may be a few of those that don't work till fx4
16:49 @kbrosnan: https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Overview
16:52  steffen123_: am i right in thinking that linux distros replace the default cert list with whatever they use?
16:52 @kbrosnan: yes
16:54  steffen123_: ok thanks
16:55  steffen123_: and does FF/NSS use the mozilla list on all versions of windows?
17:03 @kbrosnan: steffen123_: different versions of firefox will have different ca support
17:03 @kbrosnan: ex. Firefox 2 does not know what an ev-ssl cert is
17:04  steffen123_: ok turns out the windows question was irrelevant, the user who is supposed to help me figure out why some FFs don't take the cert can't read ;)
17:05  steffen123_: seems ubuntu is lacking my issuers' CA
17:05 @kbrosnan: steffen123_: verify the cert chain
17:07 @kbrosnan: if you have openssl installed I can give you a command to run. if not then there is a website that will check for ssl errors. need a few moments to dig that stuff up
17:07  steffen123_: i found one website for that but it doesnt support SNI so wasn't useful
17:08  steffen123_: but i've got openssl
17:08 @kbrosnan: openssl s_client -connect example.com:443
17:09 @kbrosnan: might be helpful to pipe that into a file or less
17:09  steffen123_: hm that also gives the wrong cert, is that supposed to work with SNI?
17:10 @kbrosnan: i don't know
17:12 @kbrosnan: how about? http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html
17:13  steffen123_: also doesnt seem to support SNI :(
17:15  steffen123_: i should probably mention the actual problem lol
17:15  steffen123_: my cert for https://the-movement.info is accepted by FF on gentoo and winXP, but not on ubuntu10.10
17:17 @kbrosnan: is this installed? http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/ca-certificates
17:18  steffen123_: yes
17:20 @kbrosnan: tried a new Firefox profile?
17:21  steffen123_: just tried deleting ~/.mozilla, same error
17:22  steffen123_: "... hasn't been verified by a recognized authority."
17:22  steffen123_: that CA being "Go Daddy Secure Certification Authority"
17:24  steffen123_: which does appear in the FF cert manager on my gentoo, but not in the xubuntu
17:24  steffen123_: under "The Go Daddy Group, Inc."
17:25  steffen123_: it also appears in the list of my FF in WinXP
17:27 @kbrosnan: just tried visiting the site in a clean Firefox profile under windows 7. I get an error there too, I would guess that the cert chain is not correctly installed
17:27 @kbrosnan: working with your ssl reseller would be the best way to work through the issue
17:30  steffen123_: i just tried it with win7-FF too and also get the error.. even weirder, IE8 on win7 does verify it, but using the "go daddy class 2 CA"
17:31  steffen123_: ok, i'll see what they say, thanks so far :)
17:32 @kbrosnan: not really all that weird. ie8 is its own program. they do their own ca work
17:32  steffen123_: no i meant that IE verifies it via "go daddy class 2" whilst gentoo-FF does it via "go daddy secure CA"

18:24  dave_mwi: fedora 14, firefox 3.6.12. I'm having a strange problem. I cannot get firefox to work with Bank of America's site. used to just fine. now it gives me strange results. Galeon, for example, works just fine. Is anyone else on Linux having the same problem?
18:25  dave_mwi: Might have something to do with a certain kind of HTTPS login, redirect, flow, etc...?
18:26 @kbrosnan: safe mode? new profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+troubleshooting
18:27  dave_mwi: kbrosnan: good suggestion...will try now
18:30  dave_mwi: kbrosnan: thanks! worked.
18:31 @kbrosnan: safe mode or the profile?
