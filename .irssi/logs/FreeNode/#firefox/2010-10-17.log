12:45  Thomas`-: hey    anyone seen a realtime css editor that is a bit better than web developer toolbar
15:07  builtrs: How about Xmarks?
15:19  builtrs: Can I use private browsing on ff?
15:22  ubunturos: yes
15:22  ubunturos: if you are using Firefox on any Linux distro, click on tools and click "Start Private Browsing"
15:24  builtrs: ubunturos: Do you use Xmarks?
15:24  ubunturos: builtrs: no, Xmarks is a IRC client?
15:25  builtrs: Bookmark synchronization, you're just kidding
15:25  namero999: hi, will please anyone help me understand this weird behaviour of firefox? I have a draggable div inside a bigger div
15:25  ubunturos: builtrs: oh, sorry, I did not now that. But I do not use Xmarks. ;)
15:25  ubunturos: know*
15:26  namero999: dragging is ok, but as soon as I approach the corners of the bigger div, dragging goes choppy
15:26  namero999: i can provide demo
15:26  namero999: firefox 3.6, every other browser is fine.
15:26  namero999: weird thing because only near borders :)
15:27  builtrs: ubunturos: :)
15:28  namero999: the code is so simple and linear that I cannot see how it could be the problem
15:31  builtrs: ubunturos : How to use greasmonkey?
15:32  builtrs: Actually how to write such a script?
15:34  ubunturos: builtrs: oh, I haven't used that software. If you know Javascript and understand DOM (Document Object Model), you may be able to write a script. But be careful with what you write. Understand the implications.
