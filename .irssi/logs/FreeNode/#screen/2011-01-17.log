00:22  iaj: lo there:)
00:23  iaj: screen is with <C-A>h creating hardcopy.0 every time.. is there any way to have it iterate (eg. = not overwriting a prior file there) ?
00:25  rudi_s: iaj: .0 is the window nummer.
00:26  rudi_s: You can set hardcopy_append on so it appends to the hardcopy file.
00:26  iaj: rudi_s: hmm so theres no other way? for creating new files?
00:27  rudi_s: iaj: I don't think so, you could map hardcopy with a different file name, but that won't iterate.
00:27  rudi_s: What exactly are you trying to do?
00:27  iaj: well rudi_s , I'm trying myself wanting to log some parts of what I currently see - hitting C_a h for that purpose... but I just found out theres only one file there :)
00:28  rudi_s: iaj: Hm, you could use a log file, but that'll log everything. 
00:28  iaj: rudi_s: hmm.. yeah... I just find myself doing that pretty often
00:29  rudi_s: iaj: But you could create a custom mapping.
00:29  iaj: you know any common way to rename the file?
00:29  iaj: rudi_s: like what for?
00:29  iaj: I could have a file that executes a command to a certain part... is that possible?   Like to do :!mv ~/hardcopy.0 <cursor pos>
00:30  rudi_s: bind ^whatever eval "hardcopy $HOME/.tmp-file" "exec shell-command-to-rename-it"
00:30  rudi_s: Should work.
00:31  rudi_s: The script would check what hardcopy.* already exist and rename it accordingly.
00:42  rudi_s: iaj: ^
00:51  iaj: rudi_s: thanks.. :) 
00:51  iaj: theres no way to use a : command within screen?
00:58  rudi_s: np
00:58  rudi_s: iaj: : command? Sure exec is a : command, as is eval
00:59  iaj: rudi_s: can I just have a eval command but not executed - letting me on the commandline?
00:59  rudi_s: iaj: Oh, I'm not sure. I don't think so.
