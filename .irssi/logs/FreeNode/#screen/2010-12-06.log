17:25  oskie: is there a way to programmatically get the current title of a window?
17:31  TauPan: oskie: with bleeding edge screen from git, you can screen -X title
17:32  oskie: yeah but that's how you set it?
17:33  TauPan: oops
17:33  TauPan: screen -q -Q title
17:33  TauPan: I meant
17:34  oskie: ah, cool
17:36  oskie: thanks for the info, TauPan
17:53  rtyler: howdy chaps, I've got a custom .screenrc for a specific environment that I want to set up for work-related development
17:54  rtyler: I'm wondering if there's a way to set the path for all terminals in that screen session *and* I'd like to start an ssh-agent boudn with that screen session
18:32  Soliton: rtyler: chdir
18:33  rtyler: I figured out the path thing (just as simple setenv) but the ssh-agent thing is trickier it looks like
18:33  Soliton: rtyler: not using ssh-agent but you just need to setenv in screen the env variables that the agent sets.
18:45  oskie: why not just put something like this in .bashrc? http://pastebin.com/JZdERm32
