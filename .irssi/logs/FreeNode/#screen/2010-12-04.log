15:02  argos-void: strange things: vim colors work, but man pages and PS1 dont?
18:55  m0ar: Is the $TERM length fix going into the main branch anytime soon?
18:57  Gedge: [22:45:06] <sadrul> if you mean the fix in  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=screen.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/jesstess-screen, I would say it's  likely to get merged with master.
18:57  Gedge: (from Dec 2nd)
18:57  m0ar: Gedge: Yep, that's it
18:57  Gedge: 'when' is another question, of course
18:57  Gedge: Can't you checkout the branch with it in?
18:58  m0ar: I'm not perfectly sure on how to do that, I get screen-git from the arch AUR
18:58  m0ar: just AUR*
18:58  Gedge: AUR?
18:58  m0ar: Gedge: user repo of arch linux
18:58  Gedge: pre-built?
18:59  m0ar: Gedge: Nope
18:59  m0ar: Gedge: Hey, give me a second
18:59  Gedge: so you could apply the patch
18:59  Gedge: If I told you how...
18:59  m0ar: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/screen-git/screen-git/PKGBUILD
18:59  m0ar: That's the packagebuild
18:59  m0ar: Where and how do I also apply that hesstess-screen?
19:00  m0ar: If that's how it works..
19:00  Gedge: looks like you are pulling the right patches
19:00  Gedge: Can you do this for me:
19:01  Gedge: cd <dir where it is downloaded to>
19:01  Gedge: $srcdir
19:01  Gedge: cd $srcdir/screen
19:03  m0ar: How do I know where my srcdir is? echo $srcdir outputs nothing
19:03  m0ar: God, I need to get comfy with git
19:03  Gedge: hang on... will google it
19:08  Gedge: Not getting anywhere - want to give me an a/c on the box, so I can look around?
19:08  Gedge: I could be a horrid hacker, mind. :)
19:08  m0ar: I'll ask the peeps in #archlinux, give me a second
19:08  Gedge: ok
19:10  m0ar: Gedge: Might be /tmp/clyde-m0ar/screen-git/
19:12  m0ar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/300307/
19:12  m0ar: Gedge: That seems right
19:13  m0ar: When I cd to that dir, what git command do I run to get the patch files?
19:14  Gedge: do 'git status' first
19:14  m0ar: fatal: not a git repo
19:14  Gedge: which dir are you in?
19:14  m0ar: the one I ls:ed
19:15  Gedge: (the script suggests that the dir is called 'screen' not 'screen-git')
19:15  Gedge: so I have my doubts
19:15  m0ar: hm, wierd
19:15  m0ar: Oh well, I've got the packagefile and stuff in that folder, so if I can get the patchfiles in there a simple makepkg might do the trick?
19:16  Gedge: do a ls in the build and src sub-dirs
19:16  Gedge: sorry, pkg and src
19:17  m0ar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/300310/
19:17  Gedge: It really helps if you do 'ls -l' or 'ls -F' ideally...
19:18  Gedge: so I can see if src/screen is a dir...
19:18  m0ar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/300313/
19:18  m0ar: Yeah, sorry
19:18  Gedge: I suspect it is, so cd src/screen
19:19  m0ar: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/300314/
19:19  Gedge: git status
19:19  Gedge: in there
19:19  m0ar: On master branch, nothing to commit
19:19  Gedge: should say you have 'master' checked out
19:19  m0ar: Looks wonders
19:19  m0ar: # On branch master
19:19  m0ar: nothing to commit (working directory clean)
19:20  Gedge: try:  git checkout jesstess-screen
19:20  m0ar: Branch jesstess-screen set up to track remote branch jesstess-screen from origin.
19:20  m0ar: Switched to a new branch 'jesstess-screen'
19:21  Gedge: ok, so now you have the patch checked out, just need to get it built... looking...
19:23  Gedge: cd ..
19:23  m0ar: Yees
19:23  Gedge: rm -r screen-build
19:23  Gedge: cp -r screen screen-build
19:24  m0ar: Yees
23:35  DeathWolf: does anyone know if it's possible to change a screen variable in an existing session?
23:36  DeathWolf: (as in configuration variable)
23:36  DeathWolf: "screen -L command" doesn't seem to log anything:/
23:36 * DeathWolf wants to be able to start a new window and log it automatically
23:38  rudi_s: DeathWolf: ^a :shell new-value (for example)
23:39  DeathWolf: ohhh thanks
23:40  rudi_s: np
23:40  rudi_s: You can run any command with ^a : (like in your screenrc).
23:40  DeathWolf: rudi_s: sadly screen -L still doesn't log:(
23:40  DeathWolf: so I guess -L doesn't enable logging like I thought
23:41  rudi_s: DeathWolf: What are you trying to do?
23:41  DeathWolf: trying to open a new window with logging enabled by default
23:41  Gedge: ^a : deflog on
23:41  DeathWolf: that'd be for any new window though
23:41  Gedge: then turn it off afterwards ;-)
23:42  DeathWolf: I've got a program that doesn't behave if it's not in interactive mode, and I need its output(it will exit, so it's not a problem)
23:42  Soliton: ^A: screen -L command works
23:42  Soliton: seems like another argument parsing bug on the command line.
23:43  DeathWolf: that's possible
23:43  DeathWolf: any fix for it?
23:43  Gedge: yes, hack the source
23:44  DeathWolf: alternatively, is it possible start a screen in a script(ie without a valid term)
23:44  Soliton: sure.
23:44 * DeathWolf stares at Soliton with puppy eyes
23:45  Gedge: screen -dm ?
23:45  Gedge: search the manpage for '-d -m'
23:46  DeathWolf: thanks Gedge, I had tried -Dm by mistake
23:47  DeathWolf: I assumed that wasn't working;)
