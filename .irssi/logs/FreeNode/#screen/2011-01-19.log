11:10  iaj: hm hey... how can I handle having a screen on my main system and one on my remote side, I can't use <C-A> on both I suppose :D
11:10  Gedge: you can, see the FAQ
11:19  ski: `^Aa' sends `^A' to the program in the current screen window
11:21  ski: so if a screen session is attached inside the window (be it remote or local), to send `^A"' (e.g.) to the inner screen you send `^Aa"' to the outer one
11:21  ski: &c.
11:32  iaj: Yeh thanks guys - I figured it... Think I'm gonna remap esacpe to ^s on the second screen
11:39  ski: be careful to make sure flow control is turned off, then
11:52  iaj: hmmm is   'escape ^S'  wrong?
11:52  iaj: because I get an error message when I load
11:53  ski: you need two characters for `escape'
11:53  ski: e.g. `escape ^Ss'
11:53  ski: that means `^S' will be the screen escape, and that `^Ss' will send `^S' to the window (and that `^S^S' will switch to the window shown previously)
11:54  ski: (the default is `escape ^Aa')
11:55  iaj: Oh thanks...
11:55  iaj: That helped loads.
11:55  iaj: Is there a color keycode for magenta..?
11:56  TauPan`: man screen|less -p magenta
11:56 --- TauPan` is now known as TauPan
11:57  TauPan: (manpage-bot strikes again \o/ )
12:02  Gedge: iaj: did you actually read the FAQ?
12:13  doonie: back again :) so as I previously mentioned. when I do screen -r or initiate a new screen, it sets the columns to 80, instead of the current $COLUMNS. I cannot find the setting to set it to 80/auto?
12:13  iaj: Gedge: I tried yeah.. by setting ^S oly tho :(

15:02  iaj: hey there :D
15:03  iaj: I've got a question - I can fire up several screens by putting "screen" at the bottom of my .screenrc and start apps by "screen appname"  however how would I supply "ssh foo@foobar.com" to be launched in a screen window?
