06:17  aefjt: I can get my shell running inside xterm, to set the window title of xterm. Can I do the same for screen session name?
06:31  aefjt: It looks like I can use $STY in zsh's precmd and prompt and remember to update it each time because screen does not do that
07:11  aefjt: Hm, screen doesn't provide a way to change session names on the command line, either.

13:23  iaj: lo.. someone up?
13:29  Gedge: iaj: depends on the question ;-)   ....?
13:31  iaj: can I somehow have a certain key to go to the horizontal split one above the current window?
13:33  Gedge: sadly, I'm no bind expert, sorry.
13:33  iaj: hmmm its the focus command that lets you tab between
13:34  Gedge: My bindings state:  :kB: focus prev
13:34  Gedge: but I don't know what :kB: means :)
13:34  iaj: :kB: ?
13:34  iaj: hmm
13:34  Gedge: (got from ^a?)
13:34  Gedge: nor do I use split windows, so...
13:43  Jafet: I hope 4.2 comes with a built in compositing wm
