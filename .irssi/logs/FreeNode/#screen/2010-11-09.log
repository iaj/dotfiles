14:49  iaj: hi there
14:49 --- Channel #screen was synced in 1 seconds
14:50  iaj: is there any way to wipe out all screen-buffers ?! that match a certain name?
14:57  ghoti: Gedge: yes, I got it, thanks.  And I responded 2 minutes later.
15:05  ghoti: Sweet: adding  alias xtitle 'echo -n "^[]0;\!:*^G^[k\!:*^[\"'  to my .tcshrc isn't perfect, but it's darn close.
15:13  twb: Heh, tcsh
15:14  twb: I bet you have a beard and wear suspenders

15:35  EGreg: can I do any kind of collaborative meeting
15:35  EGreg: where I have a number of terminals all attached to the same session?? how?
15:36  qubit: ski: I wasnt talking about "^a F", i'm want to resize the terminal, not the window
15:44  EGreg: okay I did multiuser on and acladd myfriend
15:44  EGreg: now what
15:44  Gedge: get them to attach to it
15:44  EGreg: how
15:44  EGreg: what do they type
15:44  EGreg: they are on same machine
15:44  EGreg: screen -r tty <-- what is my tty and how do I find it out
15:45  Gedge: screen -r yourid/sessid
15:45  Gedge: screen -ls    <--- you type this for the sessid
15:45  EGreg: okay great
15:45  EGreg: hopefully that should work
15:45  EGreg: [root@qbix qbix]$ screen -ls
15:45  EGreg: There is a screen on:
15:45  EGreg: 	14283.ttyp0.qbix	(Multi, detached)
15:45  EGreg: 1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-root.
15:45  EGreg: so what do they type
15:46  Gedge: screen -r yourid/14283
15:46  EGreg: what is yourid
15:46  Gedge: root?
15:46  EGreg: ah, okay

16:09  ghoti: is that an error, or just a statement of fact?
16:10 --- Channel #screen was synced in 142 seconds
16:12  Gedge: the screen binary needs to be setuid root - so that's an installation issue
16:12  Gedge: (for multiuser)
16:15  twb: I wonder if assigned specific capabilities would be sufficient
16:16  twb: e.g. http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/LowerProcessCapabilities
16:20  qubit: how do I get screen to resize the terminal to the window its showing? I see -A which seems to be the exact opposite of what I want and would imply screen does this by default, however mine isnt (terminal is putty)
16:48 --- luke-jr_ is now known as luke-jr
17:10  djp_: is it possible to issue a command in (for example) tty1 that will open an app in tty2?
17:12  Gedge: not sure what you mean by tty*
17:12  Gedge: Do you mean windows within a screen session?
17:14  djp_: Gedge: i'm running screen in a text console (tty1) and want to get elinks (running in my screen session) to open fbi in tty2.
17:14  djp_: Gedge: reason being, fbi can't open within screen unfortunately
17:15  djp_: Gedge: fbi is an image viewer for the text console
17:17  djp_: Gedge: does that make any sense?
17:17  Gedge: yes, not sure there's a trivial way for that to happen
17:18  Gedge: I mean, it's not really a screen question, from what I can see.
17:18  djp_: Gedge: ah, i see. i can do it easy enough, if i want to open an app in an X session... just that i'd like to do the same between text consoles.
17:18  djp_: Gedge: hmm... yes, you're right... maybe i should try elsewhere. thanks.
17:19  Gedge: Good luck. :)
17:20  qubit: Gedge: no, you can not launch applications in another tty, major security implications if you could
17:21  qubit: err, djp_ 
17:22  djp_: qubit: oh right. that puts the kybers on that one then! thanks qubit.
17:22  qubit: np
