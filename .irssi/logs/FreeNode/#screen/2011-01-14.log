18:14  iaj: lo there
18:14  iaj: can someone tell me whether theres a way to be able to scroll normally in iTerm.app when running a screensesssion
18:15  iaj: or shall I stick to the scrollback buffer only
18:42  iaj: no one up, as it seems?
18:49  finnomenon: I have irssi running in a screen to which I recently lost the connection. the size was wrong and it wouldn't change with the size of the terminal, so I made it fit again with  crtl+a F
18:49  finnomenon: now everything is fine again, except urls that are too long don't break at the end of the line anymore, but continue to the right and are partially invisible (unless I make the terminal larger)
18:50  finnomenon: is this an irssi or a screen problem?
18:50  yitz_: screen? Try switchign screen windows and switching back
18:53  finnomenon: how can I create a new one?
18:53  yitz_: ^ac
18:53  finnomenon: ah, thank you
18:54  finnomenon: it didn't fix the problem with the URLs though
18:55  yitz_: Beats me...
18:56  finnomenon: another question I'd have is, how can I "unsplit" a screen?
18:58  yitz_: Sorry
18:58  yitz_: ^aX    
18:58  yitz_: ^aX
18:58  yitz_: And ^a?
18:59  finnomenon: I'm afraid to remove the wrong one
19:00  finnomenon: it worked, thank you
20:35  Soliton: iaj: stick to screen's scrollback if you switch windows. if not you can try something like "termcapinfo xterm*|rxvt*|kterm*|Eterm*|putty*|dtterm* ti@:te@" in your screenrc.
20:36  iaj: Soliton: what will that achieve?
20:37  iaj: h
20:37  Soliton: presumably allow you to scroll from your terminal.
