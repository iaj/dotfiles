17:53  zok: oh snap, it does exist
17:53  zok: Is there a way (as root) that I can detach a regular user's screen session?
17:54  rudi_s: zok: Kill his screen (not SCREEN, that's the background process)?!
17:54  rudi_s: I'm not sure if that'll cause any problems though, but I don't think so.
17:55  zok: Well, both detach and attach
17:55  rudi_s: zok: Oh, su - ?
17:55  Soliton: sudo -u user screen -d
17:55  zok: ohh
17:55  zok: That makes sense
17:55  zok: I'm trying to help a buddy fix something in irssi (running on my server under screen)
17:56  zok: And I wanted to just attach to his session without having to get his password
17:56  zok: So I think that'll work
17:56  Jafet: Why not use -x, then?
17:56  zok: I'm assuming he has a tiny window (he uses a low resolution)
17:56  zok: And I like to have a nice big window :)
17:56  Soliton: ^AF
17:57  zok: Though -x might be nice so that he can see what I'm doing
19:23  katyl: Google isn't being so helpful, I'm trying to starts 5 or so windows at launch, can I specifiy which screen I want to display by defalt in my .screenrc 
19:37  Gedge: katyl:  "screen 5" at the end?
19:38  Gedge: or perhaps "select 5"

21:38  ecraven: hello :) is there a way to merge screens?
21:38  ecraven: or to add another window from inside screen? (via the command line)
21:39  rudi_s: ecraven: -X
21:39  rudi_s: No way to merge different screen sessionss though AFAIK.
