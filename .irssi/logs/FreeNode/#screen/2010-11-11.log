04:10  skonek: :blanker command works properly in precompiled Screen 4.00.03. I have tried to enable it in git version with CFLAGS="-DBLANKER_PRG" but it still doesn't work.
04:15  skonek: there are :blanker and :blankerprg but :blanker always produces empty screen even if :blankerprg is set properly
04:20  skonek: did anybody got :blanker working with git sources?
04:28  twb: Doesn't blanker take a screen command?
04:33  skonek: :blanker takes no arguments
04:34  twb: Oh, :blanker actually activates the blanker
04:35  twb: What did you set blankerprg to?
04:35  skonek: :blankerprg cmatrix - works in 4.00.03 but not with git
04:36  twb: Try :blankerprg exec cmatrix
04:36  skonek: already did this
04:41  skonek: are you running git version?
04:41  twb: I was
04:41  twb: I don't think I am at the moment
04:41  twb: The Debian maintainer backports the most fun features to the stable release, so there's less need to run HEAD on debian
04:42  skonek: what does :version show?
04:42  skonek: ok
04:42  twb: Yeah, I'm not running HEAD atm
