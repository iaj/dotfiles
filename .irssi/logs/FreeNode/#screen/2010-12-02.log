18:38  cyclist_2: Hello, there! is it possible to start another screen window from an older one [same machine]? if so, how? let us say: window #1 starts a script and and in the middle of it creates another screen window [window #2] in a particular directory and running a command [or script]; wishful thinking, again...?
18:41  Gedge: not sure I understand
18:41  Gedge: within screen, just type 'screen' for a new window
18:42  Gedge: screen will know through env. vars. that you are already in screen, so creates a new window, not a new session

18:47  cyclist_2: Gedge: I would like to have that automated [from within the first script]; I forgot to mention that I was thinking about having the new window created on a split screen, so I could follow both scripts running; the idea is for those situations where a child process could be created [for whatever reasons required] but have it showing on a diferent window as opposed to sharing the space on window #1 or not showing at all

18:51  Gedge: just use 'screen'- tried it?
18:52  Gedge: or use -X to send screen commands "screen -X split"....
19:01  cyclist_2: Gedge: thank you; I will keep on trying
20:18  Biganon: Hi
20:18  Biganon: It seems that one of my screen tabs is "frozen"
20:18  Biganon: I can't type anything in it
20:18  Biganon: how can I "kill" it, or regain control ?
20:20  Soliton: try ^A q or ^Q
20:20  sadrul: ^Ak will kill the screen window (and the app running inside it)
20:46  Biganon: thank you
20:46  Biganon: ^A q defroze it
20:46  Biganon: ^A k killed it
20:53  cafaro: Is there a way to reload .screenrc in a screen session, so you can view the changes right away?
21:28  mutante: how did i fix my window size again, if i am still logged into the same screen from another computer?
