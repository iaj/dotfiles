19:51  infid: how come when i'm using screen on a subversion checkout, it sometimes acts like i'm not in a checkout unless i cd out of the dir and back again?
19:52  infid: eg i'll do 'svn up' and it'll say the current dir isn't a working copy, but it is
19:52  sadrul: maybe the location gets removed and created in between?
19:53  infid: idk
19:53  infid: if it exists it exists though
19:53  infid: otherwise i couldnt just 'cd ; cd -' to get it to say it's a checkout again
19:54  sadrul: you could
