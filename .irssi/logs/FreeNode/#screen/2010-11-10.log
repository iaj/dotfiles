16:25  jnylen: Hey guys... I've got a screen session set up to run a few processes.  I'd like them to run exactly as though I typed in the commands from a shell - I should be able to press Ctrl+C and get dropped back to a shell, and ideally even hit the up-arrow to bring up the command.  How can I accomplish that?
16:28  Soliton: use the stuff command.
16:31  jnylen: Soliton: if I am understanding that correctly, I would load a shell, and stuff "command <enter>" into the buffer?  how can I wait until the shell prompt is ready?
16:32  Gedge: Do you need to wait?
16:32  Soliton: no need to wait.
16:32  jnylen: sounds like a good solution, thanks.  do you know offhand how to send the <enter> key?
16:32  Soliton: \012
16:32  Soliton: or a literal ^M or ...
16:33  Gedge: depends on your shell
16:33  Gedge: (the sending shell)
16:33  Soliton: he wants to put the commands in a screenrc afaiui.
16:33  jnylen: Soliton: right.
16:34  jnylen: I have the screenrc mostly working, except I tried something funky like sh -c "mycommand; bash -i" which isn't really working.
16:34  jnylen: I don't have time atm but I will give that a shot.
16:35  Soliton: stuff "mycommand\012" should work.
16:35  Gedge: screen 1
16:35  Gedge: screen -p 1 stuff "ls\012"
16:35  Gedge: screen -p 1 -X 'stuff "ls\012"'
16:35  Gedge: even
16:37  Gedge: s/'//g
16:39  Gedge: I guess, in screenrc you can just use stuff :)
17:18  jnylen: woot! 'stuff' command works beautifully, thanks gusy
17:18  jnylen: guys *
17:19  jnylen: now I want to figure out how to do the same thing in a couple of xterms.

19:56  bartj: my problem is this:
19:59  bartj: when I open gnu-screen on my server
19:59 --- Channel #screen was synced in 199 seconds
19:59  bartj: and open gnu-screen on my local machine
19:59  bartj: when I do a Ctrl-d on the server, the screen on my local machine exists!
20:00  Gedge: Search for "nested screen" in the FAQ (on the wiki (see the /topic))
20:01  Gedge: You mean ^ad not ^d, right?
20:01  Gedge: (or ^a^d)
20:01  bartj: Gedge, yes
20:02  bartj: Gedge, I mean ^ad
20:02  Gedge: yeah, it's caught by the outermost screen first
20:02  Gedge: see the FAQ
20:02  bartj: right away
20:05  bartj: ah, I have to quote it
20:05  Gedge: precisely :)
