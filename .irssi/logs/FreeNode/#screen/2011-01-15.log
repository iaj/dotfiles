13:14  Soliton: iaj: make sure whatever your terminal puts in $TERM is mentioned in that command.
13:16  Soliton: Flipo: no idea what you did nor where those messages come from. they don't come from GNU screen.
13:35  djszapi: How can I customize the time that screen shows to me ? It currently shows the server's time which is quite different compared to my client.
13:36  djszapi: there is +10 hours :P
14:23  Soliton: set your timezone accordingly?
14:31  djszapi: well, the server timezone should remain the same...
14:31  djszapi: just the finch line should change.
14:51  Soliton: so just change the timezone for that app or whatever a "finch line" is.
14:52  djszapi: * screen line, sry.
14:52  djszapi: change the timezone for one app ?
14:56  Soliton: TZ=CEST date
15:00  Gedge: ^a : setenv TZ CEST
15:10  djszapi: setenv does not make too much sense
15:13  Soliton: then you can't do what you want.
15:14  djszapi: listen, setenv is not only for one app
15:15  djszapi: TZ=CEST did not help, still 2 hours slow.
15:16  djszapi: TZ=Europe/Helsinki screen either
15:17  Soliton: you mean i did not by accident pick the timezone you want and never mentioned? hmm.
15:17  djszapi: TZ=Europe/Helsinki screen neither
15:17  Soliton: the screen command setenv is for screen and all its children.
15:17  Soliton: now you have all the info you need, good luck.
15:18  djszapi: yeah, but it cannot be set on the fly.
15:18  djszapi: when you continue a screen session
15:18  djszapi: I need to restart the screen and all its children
15:18  djszapi: ty for your rudeness
15:18  djszapi: bb
15:18  Gedge: Soliton: you tried...
15:21  Soliton: it's my one weakness.
15:43  Flipo: :fit
15:43  Flipo: sorry

23:02  finnomenon: you mean echo the result of a command in your irc client? (irssi?)
23:03  italic: no, to the screen status line, ie: echo "uptime: $(uptime)"
23:04  italic: i can pass env vars, but not the output of commands
