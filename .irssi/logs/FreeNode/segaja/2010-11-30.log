18:08 Segaja: hi
18:10 iaj: lo there :)
18:10 iaj: are you experienced with javascripting and stuff?
18:10 Segaja: somewhat
18:11 iaj: well I got a problem... I saw a snippet from javascript on a page - in order to embedd jquery on any page of my likings
18:11 iaj: http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet
18:11 iaj: that one to be exact
18:11 iaj: so I created a file in my .vimperator/plugin dir
18:11 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/298111
18:12 iaj: that's what its consisting of
18:12 iaj: but when I do a :js plugins.iaj.jQuery()  its returing the following
18:12 iaj: file:///Users/iaj/.pentadactyl/plugins/iaj.js:16: TypeError: document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0] is undefined
18:12 iaj: you happen to know what's going wrong - well oh- actually im using pentadactyl - but should be the same :(
18:14 Segaja: first: i'm not that into vimperator code
18:14 Segaja: second: pentadactyl and vimperator grow more and more apart
18:15 iaj: hmm yeah.. you may be right - but shouldn't that document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0] work in any case?
18:15 Segaja: don't know
18:15 iaj: ok :D
18:15 iaj: well thanks anyhow
