10:56  iaj: lo there i got a problem, can someone help me to solve this: http://pastebin.com/xRZ172aV  ?
10:58  LookyLuke_ICBM: what library is iconv in?
11:01  iaj: LookyLuke_ICBM: huh... how can I find out?
11:04  LookyLuke_ICBM: the fact you asked that saddens me.
11:05  iaj: LookyLuke_ICBM: yeah.. I'm sorry for saddening you :\  can you help me out?
11:29  Jomu: iaj... building git from source?
11:38  iaj: Jomu: solving that macvim git repo build issue :-)
11:38  Jomu: use MacPorts
11:38  Jomu: :)
11:38  Jomu: I know it is a no-no to lots of Macites,
11:39  Jomu: but it's your best friend if you wand anything "source"
11:40  iaj: so there ain't an 'easy' solution to my case?
11:41  iaj: well.. I wanted to have the most up-to-date version that's why I tried sticking to git :\
11:48  Jomu: it is an easy solution
11:48  Jomu: you get macports installed, and then sudo  port install git, probably :)
11:49  Jomu: I am new there, but *nix is where I live for 20yrs :)
11:49  Jomu: it is much easier than to try install all dependicies "by hand"
11:52  iaj: hm Jomu I got git installed
11:52  iaj: I try to get macvim installed
11:52  iaj: which I pulled over git.
11:53  mulletchuck: Epic question for the night
11:54  mulletchuck: for Macs with nVidia graphics cards, why hasn't anyone programmed an audioUnit to take advantage of CUDA processing?
11:57  mulletchuck: ???
11:58  Jomu: iaj then pull macvim from ports :)
11:58  Jomu: mulletchuck very general question, anyone....
12:00  mulletchuck: Jomu: earlier I had journal trouble with an external, and got it mounted with diskutil disablejournal mount dev/disk..
12:01  mulletchuck: Now that i've grabbed everything off of the disk, and reformatted it, do I need to 0 the drive before I can load it up with everything i backed up?
12:01  mulletchuck: i don't want to go through the issues with the journal being broken again
12:01  Jomu: mulletchuck wrong person to ask, I am a mac newbie :)
12:01  mulletchuck: oh ok
12:01  mulletchuck: it was my buddy's drive
12:02  Jomu: format iz probably enough
12:02  Jomu: judging by my non-mac experience
12:02  Jomu: and disk is just another unix filesystem, so - no need fo 0
12:02  mulletchuck: no need to zero it out?
12:03  Jomu: IMO, no
12:04  Jomu: journal is killed by formatting, and rebuilt from 0
12:04  iaj: Jomu: well the macports version is not up to date is it?
12:05  Jomu: I don't know, I just got what www.macports something offered
12:06  nullobj: what's the correct NSResponder event i can use to see when the mouse is moved inside an NSView?
12:07  nullobj: mouseMoved does not work while moving the cursor
12:10  mulletchuck: are there any terminal commands that I can use to verify the journal?
12:11  mulletchuck: here's a 5 year old answer to my GPU-as-audio-processorr question:  http://www.node99.org/papers/gpuaudio.pdf
12:13  Flops: What do you think of that webpage: http://rateiapps.com
12:15  mulletchuck: thanks, folks! g'night
12:23  tomasf: Flops: it's "loser", not "looser" (in this context)
12:24  Flops: xD
12:24  Flops: right :)
12:24  Flops: thanks
12:24  Flops: any other things?
12:26  Flops: Do you like the page? Shall I make some improvements? Is it unnecessary to have a page like that?
12:27  tomasf: it's hard to say which app is better when I've used neither, or in rare cases, only one of them
12:28  Flops: I could include the description, would it make it easier to vote?
12:28  Flops: I only used the 240 most popular games because of that
12:31  nullobj: uhm I can't change tracking area rect from inside updateTrackingAreas() of an NSView
12:32  nullobj: that's crazy :-/
13:00  nullobj: anyone know where can I found the Angle 45 Resize Cursor. I still not found it between default cursors
13:01  nullobj: well found in IB :)

13:56  infrid: got major weird connection problems.. perhaps someone can help/
13:56  infrid: using an nsconnection, to connect to a server via amf..
13:57  infrid: and everythings fine, but when I logout of the server, it wont let me login again unless I restart my app..
13:57  tomasf: amf?
13:57  infrid: actionscript messaging format..
13:57  infrid: but don't get lost in that..
13:57  infrid: the point in my question is to ask if nsconnection somehow persists something (like a cookie)
13:58  infrid: because I get rid of all my nsconnections, all released, completed.. and the server still seems to know it's me when I have a new nsconnection.. how is that!?
13:59  tomasf: debug it. look at what data it sends when it works vs. not works
14:01  infrid: tomasf: I've been doing that - and I know amf really well, which is why I'm asking.. if it's possible that there's some sort of connection status that's maintained throughout the apps life..
14:01  infrid: I guess I'm just gonna have to go and read about connections in cocoa more..
14:01  tomasf: is this a regular TCP connection?
14:02  tomasf: also, I recommend using AsyncSocket over cocoa's built-in stuff. much nicer
14:03  infrid: tomasf: yeah..

16:18  nullobj: I need to order NSView's objects using sortSubviewsUsingFunction. I've done my function as here http://pastie.org/1223427
16:19  nullobj: however the order is wrong
16:19  nullobj: I wanna that order 0 is on top, then each back order 1,2,3...
16:19  nullobj: but it won't order anything
16:21 +Psy: nullmodem: Â¿?
16:21  Enchilada: Ok guys, I just got my iPhone, and I'm a complete idiot with phones.
16:21  Enchilada: What do I have to do? Insert my sim card first? Plug it into my Mac?
16:22 +Psy: duh
16:22  nullobj: Psy: I wanna that view with order 0 is on top of the other views
16:22  nullobj: then view 1 is on top view 2 but back on view 0
16:22 +Psy: nullobj: well then you have to invert your function
