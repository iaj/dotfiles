13:11  shaheen: Hi, why does "awk '{sum+=$1} END { printf ("%i\n", sum/100)}" prints "208303500", and "awk '{sum+=$1} END { print "",sum/100}'" prints "2.08304e+08" which is 208304000, where did this 500 go?
13:12  pgas: it's lost in the format
13:13  pgas: the default format is "%.6g" so only 6 digit
13:14  pgas: (you can change the default format setting CONVFMT)
13:15  shaheen: pgas: excellent info, thanks a lot man. i wish you are well paid
13:15  pgas: I wish I would too ;)
13:25  pr3d4t0r: Good morning.
13:25  pgas: morning
15:39  skered: split() doesn't support groups right?
15:41  pgas: groups?
15:41  skered: RE grouping (..)
15:41  skered: I'm guessing no
15:42  skered: Doesn't really make sense now that I'm thinking about it.
15:42  pgas: sc
15:42  pgas: maybe you want http://awk.freeshell.org/FindAllMatches
15:43  waldner: gnu awk has limited support for that in match() IIRC
15:43 * skered is using HPUX awk so GNU awk won
15:43  skered: 't work
21:30 --- y3llow_ is now known as y3llow
21:31 --- cuba33ci_ is now known as cuba33ci
23:30  oliver1804: hello, I've a little substitution problem
23:30  oliver1804: my $0 is
23:30  oliver1804: 'else','frederick',,,'franz'
23:30  oliver1804: and I want
23:30  oliver1804: 'else','frederick',NULL,NULL,'franz'
23:31  oliver1804: this is only an example and the places and counts of ,, can differ
23:32  oliver1804: gsub(/,,/,",NULL,",$0)
23:32  oliver1804:  doesn't work perfect with ,,,
23:34  cthuluh: 4# awk -F, -v OFS=, '{ for (i = 1; i < NF; i++) { if ($i == "") { $i = "NULL"; } }; print }' <<< "'else','frederick',,,'franz'"
23:34  shbot: cthuluh: 'else','frederick',NULL,NULL,'franz'
23:36  igli: i <= NF
23:37  igli: (or you won't deal with trailing NULL)
23:37  oliver1804: cthuluh: no way via simple regex in a function?
23:37  cthuluh: igli: right
23:38  cthuluh: oliver1804: regexen aren't simple
23:38  oliver1804: I ask because there a re many lines - it's not that I don't understand :-)
23:40  oliver1804: almost 500,000 with 90 columns each
23:41  oliver1804: and that is only 1 part of the whole thing :-)
