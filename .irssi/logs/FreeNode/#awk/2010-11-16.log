01:44  KB1JWQ: How do I ask awk to print out everything except $2?
01:46  g0pher: { $2=""; print $0 }
01:47  skered: Wouldn't that print an extra OFS
01:51  skered: { $2="\b"; print }
01:55  g0pher: skered - maybe you outthinking the question -- iirc once u do something to $x  - reparses $0 ?
01:58  skered: Well what is awking printing when you set $2 to a null string?
01:58  skered: awk rather
01:58  skered: A null string. So $2 is still printed. 
01:59  g0pher: it reparses $0 - lets do a test 
02:00  skered: [dereks@ircbsd /usr/home/dereks]$ echo 1 2 3 | awk -v OFS="," '{ $2=""; print $0; }'
02:00  skered: 1,,3
02:06  cthuluh: the only problem is that $2="\b" puts a real \b char  in the output, here
02:07  g0pher: skered - u r correct - leaves an extra FS between $1 and $3
02:07  skered: cthuluh: Yeah, it's a ugly hack... also if OFS isn't 1 then it breaks 
02:08  cthuluh: awk -v n="$n" '{$n = ""; sub(/[[:space:]][[:space:]]/, " ")}; 1'   doesn't leave a \b behind
02:09  skered: So the solution is to loop over NF with and if that skips when for looping var is the field[s] you want to skip? 
02:10  skered: cthuluh: What if your OFS isn't space?
02:13  cthuluh: if FS != OFS then you'll have a problem, yes
02:13  g0pher: even tried { $2=\"\"; $0=$0; print $0 } - still left 2 spaces beween $1 $3
02:14  cthuluh: I mean, you'll still have a problem if FS != OFS with something like  '{$2 = ""; sub(FS FS, OFS); print }'
02:18  skered: echo 1 2 3 | awk -v n="2" -v OFS="," '{$n = ""; reg=",+"; print reg; sub(reg, OFS )}; 1'
02:18  skered: How about that?
02:18  skered: er minus that "pring reg;" part 
02:20  skered: awk -v n="2" '{$n = ""; reg=OFS"+"; sub(reg, OFS )}; 1'
02:20  skered: rather
02:21  skered: KB1JWQ is long gone.. { $2=""; print } worked for him
02:22  KB1JWQ: Heh, sorry.
02:22  KB1JWQ: Got distracted by shiny things. :-)
02:22  KB1JWQ: Thanks for the help, though. :-)

03:44  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Yo'.
03:44  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Did you guys ever sort out the logged vs. not logged channel thing?
03:45  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: I can share my logs AFTER there's agreement and we advertise that in the /topic.
03:48  g0pher: pr3d4t0r - thanks - wonder if logging channel such a good idea - After sometime - i trash channel
03:48  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: OKi.  Let me know.
03:48  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: I do log it anyway.  It just isn't public ;)
03:48  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: And it's not for sharing either unless all participants in a conversation agree it's OK, at least in public.
03:49  g0pher: pr3d4t0r - in spite of my posts - there are good ideas posted here 
03:53  g0pher: pr3d4t0r - also have logs of #awk back before doomsday - Before freenode decided to trash those on t-mobile
03:54  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Heh.

05:21  g0pher: pr3 - am working on a one page awk for newbies - any ideas ?
05:28  cthuluh: Hmmm, perhaps the '!a[$0]++' thing
05:28  cthuluh: I think it explains well how awk can be powerful and elegant
05:28  cthuluh: yet, it"s not so easy to understand
05:36  g0pher: cthuluh - ment more basic - many posts here are from newbies
