04:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#awk -o pr3d4t0r]
04:25  cthuluh: huhu
04:25  pr3d4t0r: Hrm... g0pher isn't here.
04:25  pr3d4t0r: What happened with the logged channel request?
04:25  cthuluh: pr3d4t0r: as I said, the problem with stat(1) is when you have portability issues. so use stat(1), but don't use Mac OS X ;)
04:26 * pr3d4t0r doesn't recall who the current channel owner is.
04:26  cthuluh: are there channel owners, on freenode?
04:27  cthuluh: /msg chanserv access #awk list could perhaps help
04:28  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: It's info #awk - it's still tag's.
04:29  cthuluh: oh right, never use this command :)
04:29  cthuluh: used*
04:29  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Why the hating on OS X?  Very nice OS.  It's what Linux could be if it had a decent GUI and some QA.
04:31  cthuluh: I guess my point of view is more philosophical than practical. *shrug*
04:31  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Heh.
04:31  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: In the end, it all gets mixed.
04:33  cthuluh: everyone has his own way of thinking IT, in the end it doesn't really matter, don't you think?
04:33  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Indeed.
04:33  cthuluh: I was not trolling, just trying to be... funny? :P
04:33  Riviera: I laughed.
04:33  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: When we adopted open source software at Walmart that was the one thing I had to teach people over and over.
04:34  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: "Your policy about no open source failed."  "Why?"  "Because you already have a ton of it in-house and you don't even know it."
04:34  Riviera: You work for Walmart?
04:35  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: I used to.
04:35  cthuluh: it doesn't really matter, but in the end, I would not use Mac OS X, even if you paid me :P
04:35  Riviera: pr3d4t0r: certainly quite interesting for a while
04:35  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: It was the best place for whom I ever worked so far.
04:35  Riviera: oh, really
04:35  Riviera: why so?
04:36  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: It was just a great place to be.  We got to play with cool tech, we got to make decisions that affected millions of people worldwide, our co-workers were some of the smartest people I've ever met.
04:36  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: Good times.
04:36  Riviera: :)
04:37  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: I left when my cycle of innovation ended.  After the high of 3 years inventing cool stuff, I wouldn't stick around to wait for the next one.
04:38  pr3d4t0r: Riviera: Plus, to be frank, the innovation pace slowed.
04:39  Riviera: cthuluh: see
04:39  Riviera: cthuluh: that's what i earlier meant ;)
04:39  Riviera: cthuluh: imagine how it'll be to be an administrator in 10 years :)
04:40  cthuluh: pr3d4t0r: and (just being curious), what are you doing, right now? :)
04:41  cthuluh: Riviera: remember what we talked about, the 20 years old technologies still used right now? well, I bet things won't be so different in ten years :P
04:41  Riviera: cthuluh: that only was about universities, they indeed never change 8)
04:46  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Right now I run engineering for one of the largest dating sites in the world.
04:50  cthuluh: nice, it must be funny (or not? :P). you see Riviera, things change, but there still are interesting things to do :)
04:51  cthuluh: (I hope so....)
04:51  pr3d4t0r: Heh.
04:51  cthuluh: anyone with a awk question? :P
04:51  pr3d4t0r: Have a good night, peeps.
04:51  pr3d4t0r: Z z .
04:51  Riviera: nite pr3d4t0r :)
04:51  cthuluh: good night pr3d4t0r

13:41  Peace-: ok :D
13:41  Peace-: echo "<profileinfo width="1024" display_aspect_den="9" frame_rate_den="1" description="1024x576 16:9 PAL" height="576" frame_rate_num="25" display_aspect_num="16" progressive="1" sample_aspect_num="1" sample_aspect_den="1"/>" | awk   '/frame_rate_den=/{print $2}'
13:41  Peace-: sorry ...............echo "<profileinfo width="1024" display_aspect_den="9" frame_rate_den="1" description="1024x576 16:9 PAL" height="576" frame_rate_num="25" display_aspect_num="16" progressive="1" sample_aspect_num="1" sample_aspect_den="1"/>" | awk   '/frame_rate_num=/{print $2}'
13:42  Peace-: i need to get 25 / 1
13:42  Peace-: that is 
13:42  Peace-: frame rate num  / frame rate den
13:43  taylanub: learn awk :P
13:43 * Peace- searching the solution if anyone has ideas
13:43  Peace-: taylanub: :P
13:43  Peace-: i guess i should use -F=
13:43  Peace-: but it doens't work xD
13:44  taylanub: so you have that one long line
13:44  taylanub: and you need to values from that HTML tag
13:44  taylanub: (XML rather)
13:44  taylanub: two values*
13:45  Peace-: well that is a kdenlive profile 
13:45  Peace-: xD
13:45  taylanub: whatever, it's an xml tag
13:45  Peace-: yea it's like xml 
13:45  taylanub: and you want to 'value' of two 'properties'
13:45  taylanub: it _is_ xml
13:45  taylanub: but we're offtopic :P
13:46  Peace-: i need to get the correct frame rate
13:46  taylanub: i'd use sub()
13:46  Peace-: ah 
13:48  taylanub: echo 'foo="bar" baz="bat"' | awk '{ var1=$0; sub(/foo="([^"]*)"/, "\1", var);  same_with_the_other; }'
13:48  taylanub: or something, not sure about how to quote the " inside //
13:48 * taylanub experiments
13:48  Peace-: you mean replace " with space?
13:48  Peace-: let's try xD
13:49  taylanub: forgot some things
13:49  taylanub: first of all, i forgot "var1" and used "var" :P
13:49  taylanub: and inside the //, add .* to the front and end
13:53  taylanub: does sub() somehow not have back-references ?..
13:54  Peace-: taylanub:  echo '<profileinfo width="1024" display_aspect_den="9" frame_rate_den="1" description="1024x576 16:9 PAL" height="576" frame_rate_num="25" display_aspect_num="16" progressive="1" sample_aspect_num="1" sample_aspect_den="1"/>' | awk '/frame_rate_num/{$1 gsub(/\"/," ") ; print $7 ; print $15 }'  
13:54  Peace-: xD
13:54  Peace-:  i guess i got it in some strange way xD
13:54  taylanub: but then you're entirely relying on the order of the properties. which i would try to avoid
13:55  Peace-: i have to see if it works for every profile .. then 
13:55  taylanub: i would just use a straightforward sed substitute for that anyway, if i'd be to rely on the order of the properties
13:58  taylanub: (by the way to correct term seems to be "attribute" instead of "property"; in <foo bar='baz'/>, foo is the element, bar is an attribute of the element, baz is the value of bar.)
14:31  Peace-: taylanub: at the end i have created a sick array with my hand
14:32  Peace-: xD
14:32  Peace-: too much in thinking
