19:37  Operator33: So if I use "for (i in somearray)" to iterate over something, I know the order is arbitrary, but it is consistent?
19:38 --- Operator33 is now known as Operator23
19:41  gnomon: Operator23, the order may be consistent, but it is not guaranteed to be.
19:41  Operator23: gnomon: OK, that's all I wanted to know.
19:42  Operator23: Is there a recommended way to get consistency?
19:42  mattymo: Operator23, for loop in the traditional sense where you do for ( x =1; x <= arraylength; x++ )
19:42  gnomon: Grab the list of keys with 'for (i in ...)', sort that list however you like, and iterate through the list of keys.
19:42  mattymo: s/=1/= 1
19:45  waldner: Operator23: gnu awk has a variable that, when set, guarantees that the keys are retrieved in order
19:45  waldner: not standars
19:45  waldner: *d
19:46  gnomon: waldner, hey, speaking of gawk, what's the latest news about the bytecode engine?
19:46  gnomon: (also: hullo!)
19:46  waldner: gnomon: not sure, but I think it's still beta
19:47  waldner: (hallo)
20:44  biberao: hi
