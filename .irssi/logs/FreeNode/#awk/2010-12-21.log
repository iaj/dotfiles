22:51  steve___: awk 'NR>4{print x} {x=$0}'
23:33  Ed_Money: hello awkers. Question: The first field in my text file that I'm processing using Awk contains fractions in the form "7/16, 3/17, 4/5, etc." When awk reads theses values, it only captures the numerator. How do I get awk to read and evaluate the full fraction?
23:37  steve___: 4# echo "7/16, 3/17, 4/5" | awk -F, '{print $1}'
23:37  shbot: steve___: 7/16
23:37  steve___: Ed_Money: ^^
23:38  Ed_Money: clarification: awk does read the full fraction as $1, but when I do a math operation like $1 * 5 for example, it will return 35 (7*5), instead of doing (5 * 7/16)
23:43  cthuluh: 4# echo "7/16, 3/17, 4/5" | awk -F, '{ split($1, a, "/"); print a[1]/a[2]}'
23:43  shbot: cthuluh: 0.4375
23:43  cthuluh: (just an idea)
23:46  steve___: echo "7/16, 3/17, 4/5" | awk -F[/,] '{print ($1/$2*5)}'
23:46  Ed_Money: cthuluh: very cool. so split puts an array into a. nice
23:47  Ed_Money: steve__: the field-separator needs to be space, but thanks anyway
