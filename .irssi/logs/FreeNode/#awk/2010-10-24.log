04:27  skered: If you're reading two strings of numbers (ints) would it be faster to convert to int then compare or do one string compare?
04:29  jwillia3: skered, why don't you run some real tests on your data?
04:32 * skered doesn't have the data.
04:34  jwillia3: skered, time awk 'BEGIN {for (i=0;i<1000000;i++) print(1,2);}' | awk '{$1==$2}'
04:45  skered: Is that a pass like statment in awk?
04:45  skered: Like Python's pass
04:46  jwillia3: awk doesn't need pass, you can just use ;

05:06  skered: In [g]awk you can include a field inside a match's regex string?
05:06  skered: match( $0, "($2 ?)+$" ) 
05:07  skered: I think this is gawk only because of the grouping in the regex

09:07  g0pher: need to add basic page on how to run awk in windows 
09:19  g0pher: what name it ?   AwkOnWindows2 ??
09:20  g0pher: and Glossary page ?
09:21  probonono: AwkOnWindowsHowto
09:21  g0pher: thnx 
09:29  g0pher: fun - http://awk.freeshell.org/Glossary
09:45  g0pher: http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkOnWindowsHowto
10:02  g0pher: pgas: am done - will work on Glossary and AwkOnWindowsHowto
10:27  g0pher: probonono: we need a really basic starter page for newbies - name ? Starter ??
10:30  probonono: GettingStarted ? AwkForNewbies ? FirstSteps ? 
10:39  g0pher: good ideas - was thinking for basic first page for windows users that most likely have no concept what a shell was ?
10:41  g0pher: probonono: why not you help me develop such a page ?
10:50  g0pher: probonono: imho GettingStarted  would be good name ?
10:52  probonono: Sure. Sorry, no time to help atm, but thanks very much for your effort.
10:57  g0pher: You have such good ideas - wish you had time - http://awk.freeshell.org/GettingStarted
11:14  g0pher: probonono: no time ? trying to do http://awk.freeshell.org/GettingStarted
11:45  g0pher: am i back ?
11:55  g0pher: anyone up ?
11:58  cthuluh: I'm alive
12:00  g0pher: cthuluh: any ideas re http://awk.freeshell.org/GettingStarted ?
12:01  cthuluh: huh, not really... if that's a mini tutorial to get started ith awk on windows I'm afraid I can't help
12:02  g0pher: just what are your ideas re someone New to awk ? 
12:05  cthuluh: g0pher: I think that you're right to provide help about running it on windows, though, isn't awk present in the cygwin package?
12:06  cthuluh: (I don't know anything about windows CLI / shell / quoting problems)
12:10  g0pher: Yes But you know awk - eg for Newbies - How best to explain what it does ?
12:17  cthuluh: hmmm, awk is a powerful language you can use to extract / transform data from files or streams. it has associative arrays, advanced maths and regex capabilities, and is elegant. see this example: awk '/foo/ { print $3 }' file  <-- this will print the third field of each line in file that contains the 'foo' regex
12:17 --- cga_ is now known as cga
12:17  cthuluh: to be honest, I don't really see a way to explain it to a 'newbie'. I think that awk should be learnt by reading examples
12:18  g0pher: thanks cthuluh
12:18  cthuluh: so the FAQ is probably a good place to send 'newbies' to
12:20  g0pher: the Faq can be intimidaing to a newbie - was thinking of very basic start ideas
12:21  cthuluh: maybe take some easy examples from it and try to dissect them?
12:22  pgas: for instance you could start with http://www.pement.org/awk/awk1line.txt and translate the example so that they work in dos
12:22  g0pher: ok - my idea from http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkOnWindows was
12:23  g0pher: Example: awk /foo/{print(NR,$0)} file  prints lines from file containing foo preceded by the line number.
12:26  g0pher: pgas: new pages http://awk.freeshell.org/GettingStarted
12:29  g0pher: also http://awk.freeshell.org/GettingStarted
12:29  g0pher: nd http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkOnWindowsHowto
12:30  g0pher: and http://awk.freeshell.org/Glossary
12:50  g0pher: you have to be asking yourself-  did he fire six awks or only five? re http://awk.freeshell.org/Glossary
12:55  g0pher: re bwk - some of the most mysterious code known to man - http://awk.freeshell.org/Glossary

20:45  Cebot: hiya
20:48  Cebot: could someone help me parse an html option list for the <select> form? it's all in the form <option value="1234">FOOBAR</option> where foobar is a different number for each option and FOOBAR is the string i want to have, either in a comma separated list (Foobar1, Foobar2, ...) or one foobar per line
20:57  waldner: it depends on how the html you have is formatted

21:06  waldner: so what's left (records, $0) must be what you're after
21:06  waldner: it needs gnu awk though because the ability to assign a regexp to RS is an extension
21:07  jwillia3: oh, is it?
21:07  jwillia3: can FS be an expression?
21:07  jwillia3: in posix
21:07  waldner: FS, yes
21:07  waldner: RS can only be empty or a single char, in POSIX
21:07 --- Channel #awk was synced in 104 seconds
21:08  waldner: well, it says that if RS isn't empty or a single char, it's undefined
21:08  waldner: "If RS contains more than one character, the results are unspecified."
21:11  waldner: Cebot: ah, and !(NR%2) prints only even "records"
21:12  waldner: odd records are really empty, because they are between </option> and the next <option...>
21:12  Cebot: thanks a lot. though still not sure i'll be able to reproduce that tomorrow :P
21:13  waldner: np
