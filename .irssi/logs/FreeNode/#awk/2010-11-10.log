10:57  ashren: How do I match only "jv" and not everything that starts with "jv"?
10:59  waldner: make an example
11:00  ashren: awk -F: '/^ft|^jv|^ic/ { print $1,"1gid=",$4 }' $docpath/$i/current/passwd.txt

16:32  meth[phone]: is there no array primitives ?
16:34  pgas: like what?
16:34  pgas: there are = and in
16:35  pgas: gawk has also length and asort/asorti
16:35  pgas: that's about it
16:35  pgas: ah and delete
16:36  meth[phone]: for( i in [1,2,3] ) {}
16:36  meth[phone]: i was simply going to loop over a list of fields that i want to ignore so i can unset them before printing
16:37  meth[phone]: like waht if you want to print the whole like but exclude only a few
16:37  meth[phone]: the only way i know to do that is to unset them
16:37  {xmb}{bottz}7man: for ( d in split( " 2 4 6 9"))
16:38  meth[phone]: ah...
16:38  meth[phone]: yea but you can't just use array primitives obviously ?
16:38  meth[phone]: at least i think that's what you call []
16:38  pgas: ok fields are not in an array
16:39  pgas: see this, http://awk.freeshell.org/RangeOfFields 
16:39  {xmb}{bottz}7man: array ign =split( " 2 4 9"); for ( d in ign)
16:39  pgas: there are several ways to print a range of fields, no good one
16:39  meth[phone]: for( i in split() ) appears to be a syntax error
16:40  pgas: for (i=1;i<=NF;i++){ ....$i } #is the usual way to loop over fields
16:40  {xmb}{bottz}7man: ah that first code is the replacement for that
16:40  meth[phone]: yea no good way eh...
16:40  {xmb}{bottz}7man: that i pasted
16:40  {xmb}{bottz}7man: tru
16:40  meth[phone]: what you need is like a built in stdlib for awk that adds some helpers :]
16:41  {xmb}{bottz}7man: hooks
16:41  {xmb}{bottz}7man: havers
16:41  pgas: meth[phone]: well, rather several ways depending on what result you want
16:42  meth[phone]: apparently neesd to be spilt(a,"list")
16:43  meth[phone]: but unsetting the fields gives you empty fielsd instead of removing them
16:44  {xmb}{bottz}7man: yeah man
16:45  {xmb}{bottz}7man: u need to gsub the dup nons away
16:45  {xmb}{bottz}7man: and that fucks up the FS ull see
16:47  meth[phone]: well thanks anyway
