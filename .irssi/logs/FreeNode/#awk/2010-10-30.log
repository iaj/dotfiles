00:46  steve___: In the following command, there a nice way to incorporate the sed into the awk ?
00:46  steve___: awk -F'[<">]' '/storylink/ || /commentlink/ {print $9,$7}' <(curl -Ls http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/2010-10-28.html) | sed '/^(/s/$/\n/'
00:52  taylanub: append a newline if $9 starts with '(', am i right? i think:   if ( $9 ~ "^(" ) print
00:52  taylanub: erm, i mean  print ""
01:18  steve___: taylanub: ahh I see what you're saying.  I was dickin' around with gsub.  I will try your approach.
01:21  steve___: I used if ($9 ~ "comment"), as if ( $9 ~ "^(" ) have a syntax error
01:22  steve___: taylanub: thanks for the direction
01:28  igli:  /re/ for literal regex; if ( $9 ~ /^(/ ) # ?
01:30  taylanub: (i'm a noob myself, as you see. didn't know // must be used)
01:32  steve___: igli: if ($9 ~ /^\(/)  worked
01:32  igli: cool; we all start in the same place :)
01:35  steve___: Yes. Thank you both.
01:40  igli: yw
