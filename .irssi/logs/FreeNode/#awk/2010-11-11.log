09:07  joshuabud: it appears to be fine unfortunately the app that I'm using the files on is not functioning properly.
09:09  joshuabud: for some reason it's not placing the content into separate columns :(

17:23  hich: Hello. How do I remove the leading 4 white spaces of each line if there are any?
17:26  taylanub: sed 's/^    //'    or    awk '{sub(/^    /,""); print}'

19:16  skered: So I have always used /regex1/,/regex2/ to print between matching pairs... where or how does this work?
19:16  skered: if that wasn't an example from the man how could you know that works the way it does.
19:17  skered: I know a positive value express without a pattern is the same as print..
19:18  skered: nm.. "A  pattern  may  consist  of two patterns separated by a comma;"
19:19  skered: I was expecting that to be close to the definition of a pattern
19:21  skered: So something like '/.../,/.../ { ... }' is valid?
19:21  skered: It would appear so
19:23  mike_______: sure
19:25  skered: and /.../,/.../ is for all occurrences ?
19:25  skered: awk won't quit after it finds the second pattern?
19:26  skered: That appears correct as well.
