17:49  juniorbash: hi can someone help me with function split using awk?
17:49 --- Channel #awk was synced in 105 seconds
17:49  gnubien: maybe, explain more
17:50  juniorbash: i got a word in a variable for example b=sofa
17:50  juniorbash: and i want with using split command to cut the word to a table
17:51  juniorbash: and every position in a table include one letter
17:51  pgas: I'd use substr and not split and an array
17:52  juniorbash: i will try now
17:52  juniorbash: give me a minute please to make an effort
17:54  juniorbash: can you give me an example please?
17:55  pgas: 4# awk 'BEGIN{var="bla";print substr(var,1,1);print substr(var,3,1)}'
17:55  pgas: b
17:55  pgas: a
17:55  pgas: ehe, shbot left us
17:56  juniorbash: thanks
18:06  pgas: but feel free to ask here, no problem
18:52  roger21: hi, i would like to redisplay an output just by shortenning the lines (let's cut out over the 80th char), how can i do that?
18:53  roger21: +say
18:53  waldner: print susbstr(string,1,80) maybe?
19:06  roger21: wwhat should i put in string, is there a variable name for the line ?
19:06  waldner: if you're asking this, you probably shouldn't be using awk in the first place
19:06  waldner: use cut
19:07  roger21: $0
19:07  roger21: doesn't work
19:08  waldner: as I said: use cut and be happy
19:08  waldner: way easier too
19:08  waldner: cut -c 1-80
19:08  roger21: yep well trying with cut also
19:10  roger21: ok
19:10  roger21: unkewl anyway
19:11  waldner: if you want kewl, do it using F#, not awk
19:14  cthuluh: isn't F# microsoft's copy of Ocaml, as C# is microsoft's copy of Java? :P
19:15  waldner: no idea, I only hear people talkinf of it as if were kinda cool
19:16  cthuluh: I suggest trying Ocaml. and yeah, it's fun
