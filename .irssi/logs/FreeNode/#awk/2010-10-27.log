16:21  estr4ng3d: How do I say something like '{print $10}' but actually print field number 10 instead of field 1 followed by a 0?
16:27  gnubien: estr4ng3d: you want $10 printed only one time?
16:28  cthuluh: $(10)
16:33  probonono: When is ``$10'' not recognised as a reference to field# 10?
16:35  estr4ng3d: ah my bad, sorry.. data set made it look like it was appending 0 to a different field

17:51  karthee: awk '/searchsting/{print $8; mid=$8}   $0~/mid/   { do something}'   .... Here $0 is getting compared with mid not the value of mid (which is $8) .. I tried with $mid also .. Am i missing anything ??
18:14  gail_: In a textfile, every other line I have a ">" with some text... how can I replace everything between > and end-of-line with an incrementing number
18:14  gail_: so the number will go from 1 to num_lines_in_file/2

19:11  KBme: hi

19:11  pown: hmmmm
19:11  pown: check some of the links of the topic
19:12  KBme: all i know is awk '{print $n}' ;)
19:12  KBme: so, no book, really, just these online tutorials?
19:13  pown: mmm yea
19:13  KBme: (i have already checked most of those links, they don't talk much about books)

20:02  crankharder:  awk ' $1 ~ /(foo.*)/ {  }' foo.log -- what goes in the action to print what was matched by the pattern?
20:06  jwillia3: crankharder, use match(), RSTART, and RLENGTH
20:16  crankharder: thanx :)
20:31  crankharder: awk ' { start = match($5, /[0-9]+/) ; pid = substr($5, start, RLENGTH ); filename = pid ".output" ; echo $0 > filename }' production.log | tail
20:31  crankharder: so that works up until I try to echo the full line to the filename I built
20:33  pgas: it's a lot easier to remove the part you don't want
20:35  crankharder: totally open to suggestions :)
20:35  karthee: crankharder: can you explain what you are trying to do please ?
20:35  karthee: in english
20:35  pgas: it depends on the example, but you could for instance remove all the non digit
20:36  crankharder: logs have a PID in them on each line -- trying to separate the logs from each pid into different files
20:36  crankharder: so $5 is something like "foooo[123123]"
20:36  pgas: sub(/.*[[]/,"",$5);sub(/]/,"",$5)
20:37  pgas: err sub(/[]]/,"",$5)
20:37  crankharder: i really just need to fix this part:    ; echo $0 > filename
20:37  pgas: this is not awk 
20:38  pgas: (and not related to your original question)
20:38  crankharder: nevermind,  s/echo/print/ fixes it
20:39  pgas: you might need to close the files you open
21:22  KBme: ahah:part
21:22  KBme: woopsie sorry about that
21:31  karthee: awk '/string/ {store=$2}  $0~/store/ {action}'  file ....    $0~/store/ matches with  string 'store' and not the value of store variable .. i tried with $store also .. can I not do that ?
21:33  The-Compiler: hmm, maybe without the /s or something?
21:33  The-Compiler: Dunno though
21:34  karthee: ok
21:38  waldner: $0 ~ store
21:40  karthee: aah ...
