04:03  pigdude: How do you print all but the first column?
04:03  pigdude: Or, a range of columns?
04:06  gnomon: pigdude, http://awk.freeshell.org/RangeOfFields
04:06  pigdude: so...I shouldn't try this in a one-liner
04:08  gnomon: That depends entirely on your use case!  I would recommend reading and understanding the article, picking the choice best suited to your case, and then playing code golf if you feel like it.
04:08  pigdude: gnomon, thanks, I just use awk for some simple stuff in bash
04:08  pigdude: I was hoping there was a brief way to express this
04:08  pigdude: thanks gnomon !
04:08  gnomon: There are several!
04:09  gnomon: You're welcome.  Good luck!
04:27  g0pher: where can one get help re: "please wait 2 seconds for an uncompressed image" http://pastebin.com/UhUJWpHA

06:04  jaalto: Still needs to remove "]". Can this be done in one regexp?
06:05  jaalto: Gnu AWK 3.1.7
06:06  jaalto: Backslashing won't work: "^[[\\]]"
06:07  jaalto: This does: "\\[|\\]"
06:07  jaalto: But out of curiosity, how to do it solely using the <class> expression [...]

13:16  g0pher: anyone up ?
13:19  pgas: always
13:23  g0pher: my first Wiki (be kind) - http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkOnWindows 
13:25  pgas: cool thanks for your contribution!
13:25  pgas: if you want I can mirror the exe on awk.freeshell.org
13:25  pgas: in http://awk.freeshell.org/downloads/ or something like that
13:26  pgas: http://awk.freeshell.org/download/
13:26  g0pher: hich exe ? they are not mine to give permissions ?
13:26  g0pher: s/hich/which/
13:29  pgas: yes, but for instance the gpl enforce the liberty of distribution
13:29  pgas: so gnu awk can be redistributed has much as you want
13:30  pgas: *as much
13:30  pgas: you can copy it on your old floppies and give them around :D
13:31  igli: hehe
13:33  g0pher: igli is here ! - just that awk.freeshell is so good - but have found some issues there eg gawk is now 3.1.8
13:35  g0pher: pgas: what is advantage on having download on freeshell rather than just post urls to other sources ?
13:35  pgas: g0pher: feel free to edit whatever you want on the wiki
13:36  pgas: g0pher: no real advantage. sdf has been around for a long time so it won't disapper....at least it will be there as long has the wiki will be there so there is a 0% chance for the link to become dead links
13:36  g0pher: well - would do so - But often screw up - is there a way to suggest changes without editing ?
13:37  pgas: g0pher: the previous versions are not lost, so you can easily revert the pages
13:38  pgas: plus, backup are made daily, so you can't really destroy anything even if you wanted too. 
13:38  pgas: err should be made that is let me see what happens
13:38  pgas: http://pgas.freeshell.org/mirror/awkwiki/
13:41  igli: hi g0pher :)
13:44  g0pher: igli hi - are you aware of the Effort made to make awk for others on awk.freeshell.org
13:45  igli: no, not really my thing, g0pher
13:46  pgas: these efforts have somehow been killed by awk.info...which has been triggered by my annoucement about awk.info on comp.lang.awk
13:48  pgas: err my announcement about awk.freeshell.org 
13:48  g0pher: pgas - have been trashed Often on comp.lang.awk - do not let them get to you
13:49  pgas: well, it's just that we are a very small community here, and it would have been good to have more contribution
13:49  pgas: but a lot of efforts have been diverted into awk.info
13:50  pgas: which looks dead since last march 
13:50  pr3d4t0r: pgas: What's awk.info?
13:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#awk +o pr3d4t0r]
13:50  pr3d4t0r: Dammit.
13:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#awk -o pr3d4t0r]
13:51  pr3d4t0r: pgas: The web site?
13:51  pgas: a site about awk
13:51  pgas: yup
13:51  g0pher: imho awk.freeshell.org Rocks - is easy to navigate for first time awk users
13:51  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Ah.
13:51  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Is that your site?
13:51  pgas: nope
13:51  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Ah.
13:51  pgas: it's just that I went to comp.lang.awk and said "look we started awk.freeshell.org"
13:52  pr3d4t0r: pgas: :(
13:52  g0pher: Eugene - awk.freshell.org is in this channels Topic
13:53  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I think I'm a regular but I don't get to maintain the wiki :(
13:53  pr3d4t0r: :: sniffle ::
13:53  pr3d4t0r: Ah, no password :D
13:53  pgas: and the gawk author said "eh I have awk.info" and the motivated guys of comp.lang.awk  contributed to awk.info instead
13:53  pr3d4t0r: Who hosts that?  Still tag, or is it pgas?
13:54  pr3d4t0r: pgas: If the dude's from GNU I wouldn't expect less of them.
13:54  pgas: I installed the wiki on awk.freeshell.org 
13:54  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Cliquey and stubborn.
13:54  pgas: ehe, well, he didn't do anything, he just said that he had the domain
13:54  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Ah.
13:55  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I've seen other awk channels in other networks, and this one has by far the largest active group, the friendliest, and the most accurate.
13:55  pr3d4t0r: pgas: The awk.info page has more bells and whistles but I kinda like yours better.
13:56  pgas: I don't blame them for starting another site either..I'm just pissed off that they started it without even say "hi" her just when we tried to recruit
13:56  pr3d4t0r: pgas: http://javachannel.net
13:56  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I donate the server and wiki for that.
13:56  pgas: s/her /here /
13:56  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I'd be happy to donate an awkchannel.com or .net page that will point at yours, if you want.
13:58  pgas: thanks but I don't think it's necessary
13:58  g0pher: repost for pr3 - my first Wiki (be kind) - http://awk.freeshell.org/AwkOnWindows 
13:59  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Nice list of resources.
13:59  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: If I may suggest something...
14:00  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Maybe add a paragraph or two at the beginning explaining how running awk on Windows is a wee bit different from UNIX systems, mostly in terms of setup and how the shells outside of awk will treat things (e.g. CMD.EXE).  Otherwise I think it's a great page, thanks.
14:03  pr3d4t0r: pgas: The reason I suggested a higher level domain is just for visibility.
14:03  g0pher: pr3d4t0r: thanks for your suggestions - yes - issue is might post that url to others on windows that have no clue what  awk it can do is or what
14:04  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Right.
14:05  g0pher: what it can do 
14:05  pr3d4t0r: pgas, g0pher: What do you guys think?  Good material to add to the wiki?  http://ciurana.livejournal.com/5974.html
14:08  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I'd like to add my pastebin to the list too, explicitly, next to tag's.  Mine has awk syntax support built-in, for example.
14:09  pr3d4t0r: pgas: If that's cool with you, of course.
14:10  pgas: pr3d4t0r: well, to tell you the truth I don't do much for the wiki and I don't know if it needs more visibility 
14:10  g0pher: pr3d4t0r: which awk was that ? eg mawk is often 2-10x faster ?
14:11  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: gawk.
14:11  pgas: as for adding content to the wiki, sure feel free to do what you want
14:11  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: mawk can't handle the file sizes in the sample.
14:11  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: The only awk on the system where I tested this that could handle the huge honking files was gawk.  Great buffering strategy :)
14:13  g0pher: read http://awk.freeshell.org/g0pher
14:15  g0pher: eg http://anyall.org/blog/2009/09/dont-mawk-awk-the-fastest-and-most-elegant-big-data-munging-language/
14:15  pr3d4t0r: Heh.
14:16  g0pher: where mawk was 8X times Faster than gawk
14:17  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: I'll buy that :)
14:17  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: It's the buffer sizes, though.
14:18  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: mawk ran out of memory when processing my buckets.
14:18  g0pher: pgas: am confused by the Linear structure of the wiki - eg Anyone can add a page and its in the list ?
14:18  pgas: the links on the homepage are added manually
14:19  pgas: the RecentChanges page is updated automatically, and you can get a list of all the pages from http://awk.freeshell.org/?action=index
14:19  g0pher: pr3d4t0r: any way to have smaller buckets ? eg break down to smaller sizes that mawk can handle ?
14:19  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Not really.  That'd make no sense for the Hadoop cluster.
14:20  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I just don't want to go trample on your page without permission, etc.
14:20  pr3d4t0r: pgas: tag and I had a lot of fights at LeapFrog and then he started bitching here about my pastebin and so on.  That's also why I participated a bit less here.  I just didn't want to harassment.
14:21  pgas: pr3d4t0r: if I wanted to have the control on what people put their I wouldn't have setup a wiki ;)
14:21  pgas: s/their/there
14:22  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Heh - well, you know what I mean.
14:22  pgas: (plus I don't really consider the site has mine, most of the contributions have been written by others, waldner, gnomon, prince_jammys goedel..)
14:22  pr3d4t0r: pgas: I want us all to be excellent to each other :)
14:24  pgas: (to tell you the truth I'm surprised that your pastebin isn't listed therey)
14:25  pgas: http://awk.freeshell.org/ListOfPastebins <- it's on this page
14:26  pgas: I think tag's pastebin is broken, it doesn't seem to gave link back to people who tries it
14:27  pr3d4t0r: pgas: That was my beef with his.  Very cool that it's awk based, and talks to awkbot, and so on -- but uptime is a bit of an issue.
14:28  g0pher: pgas: am an old senile person - afraid if i changed a page there would be yelled at
14:28  pr3d4t0r: pgas: Meanwhile, mine's served close to 50000 pastes, and I can easily remove stuff people don't want public and so on.  When he knocked it off the /topic I was a bit peeved.
14:31  pr3d4t0r: pgas, g0pher: http://awk.freeshell.org/PasteBin - OKi?
14:32  g0pher: yes http://awkpaste.blisted.org/ appears to be broken
14:32  pgas: lisppaste: url
14:32  lisppaste: To use the lisppaste bot, visit http://paste.lisp.org/new/awk and enter your paste.
14:34  pgas: pr3d4t0r: yups looks ok. you can remove awkpaste from the topic, it is broken and cannot be used.
14:35  g0pher: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=43474
14:35  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Heh.
14:36  g0pher: You wany awk Paste Bin ? am Drunk Can give you awk Paste Bin all Night
14:36  g0pher: s/wany/want/
14:37  pr3d4t0r: g0pher: http://eugeneciurana.com/pastebin/pastebin.php?show=43476 - syntax highlights.

14:39 @pr3d4t0r: pgas, g0pher: OKi? ^^^^^
14:39 @pr3d4t0r: Hrm...
14:39 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: Do you know if that wiki accepts ad hoc HTML?  We *could* embed the pastebin into the page itself ;)
14:40 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: Either in an iframe or just the form itself, then POST to the actual pastebin from there.
14:42  pgas: ehe I don't remember which kind of tricks you can use
14:43 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: :)
14:43 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: Just me hallucinating.  Don't pay attention.
14:44 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: It's cool having a wiki for the channel.
14:44  pgas: cool you like it...it has been there since at least 2009/03 ;)
14:45 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: It perhaps needed more advertising.
14:45  g0pher: my fav http://codepad.org/ for pasting awk code
14:45 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Nice - except that awk isn't listed there!
14:46  pgas: pr3d4t0r: well, I tried in comp.lang.awk ...:D
14:46  g0pher: iirc they had a bot that alowed you to post awk code and get results ?
14:46  pgas: you can on http://ideone.com/
14:49  g0pher: pgas: not you should be intimaded by comp.lang.awk - IRC Rules !
14:51 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: I seldom go to Usenet anymore.
14:51 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: My bad.
14:52 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: I've been paying for a Unison subscription for a while, but hardly go there :\
14:52  g0pher: yes usenet is just full of spam
14:53  pgas: well, I don't go there very often either
14:53  pgas: if you use a provider like http://eternal-september.org/ you hardly see any spam
14:54  pgas: comp.lang.awk and comp.unix.shell can be helpful
14:54  g0pher: pgas: any way to communicate re awk.freeshell.org issues other than email or irc ?
14:56  pgas: you can put your questions on a page on the wiki
14:59 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: I use Unison from Germany.  Uncensored and spam filtered.  Good combination.
14:59 @pr3d4t0r: pgas: The only places where you see a ton of spam are the pr0n forums, but that comes with the territory.
