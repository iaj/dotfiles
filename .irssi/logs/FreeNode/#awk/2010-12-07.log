15:37  Pinchiukas: http://pastebin.com/dKLkjWT8 - why does memory_minimum get set to the apache path?
15:52  CyberDomovoy: i have a line that is like "some_text * 12 34 56 78 some_other_text", the '*' may or may not be present, how do i print '12' (the first set of numbers)?
15:55  pgas: Pinchiukas: hard to tell
15:56  cthuluh: CyberDomovoy: for (i = 1; i < NF; i++) { if ($i !~ [^0-9]) { print $i; next; } }
15:56  cthuluh: wild guess
16:02  CyberDomovoy: cthuluh: dit it with "if($2 == "*") print $3; else print $2", does that seems correct to you?
16:03  cthuluh: yes provided that "some_text" can't contain spaces / tabs
16:04  cthuluh: you could also print ($2 == "*") ? $3 : $2
16:04  CyberDomovoy: cthuluh: great, thx
16:20  Riviera: awk 'match($0, /[0-9]+/) { print substr($0, RSTART, RLENGTH) }'
16:20  Riviera: what about that?
16:22  cthuluh: will it print the first field that contains only digits?
