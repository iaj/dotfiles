15:29  JeffJohnson: howdy
15:29  JeffJohnson: how could I check if an file supplied per argument exists, and if not print xyz?
16:03  Riviera: 4# awk -v file=testfile; 'BEGIN { if (!system("test -f " testfile)) print "exists." else print "doesnt." }'
16:04  Riviera: oh.
16:04  shbot: Riviera: Usage: awk [POSIX or GNU style options] -f progfile [--] file ...
16:04  shbot: Riviera: Usage: awk [POSIX or GNU style options] [--] 'program' file ...
16:04  shbot: Riviera: etc... ( http://pastebin.com/24PesQCC )

16:04  shbot: Riviera: exists.
16:04  Riviera: Damn.
16:04  Riviera: :)
16:05  Riviera: 4# touch testfile; awk -v file=testfile 'BEGIN { if (!system("test -f " file)) print "exists."; else print "doesnt." }'
16:05  shbot: Riviera: exists.
16:05  Riviera: 4# awk -v file=testfile 'BEGIN { if (!system("test -f " file)) print "exists."; else print "doesnt." }'
16:05  shbot: Riviera: doesnt.
16:05  Riviera: ha.
16:05  Riviera: JeffJohnson: like that
16:05  Riviera: JeffJohnson: but be extremely careful, because of that:
16:06  Riviera: 4# awk -v 'file=testfile; echo "hi, i should not be executed."' 'BEGIN { if (!system("test -f " file)) print "exists."; else print "doesnt." }'
16:06  shbot: Riviera: hi, i should not be executed.
16:06  shbot: Riviera: exists.

16:49 --- pgas` is now known as pgas
17:03  skered: Why on earth would gawk not support  interval expressions for normal use (no options)
17:04  pgas: for backward compatibility
17:04  skered: I guess I would need --re-interval ?

18:14  skered: The issue with --posix is that it changes more than interval expressions
18:14  skered: --re-interval should JUST allow interval expressions right?
18:15 --- Channel #awk was synced in 101 seconds
18:18  waldner: yes
18:19  waldner: (you can always express interval expressions in terms of other quantifiers, btw)
18:21  skered: How would you do that?
18:22  waldner: a{3} is aaa, a{2,4} is aaa?a?, a{2,} is aaa*
18:23  skered: Gotcha.. there's a lot of instances where I'm doing something like ^.{75}
18:24  waldner: ok, that's probably not very practical then
18:24  skered: I would rather not "......"
18:24  waldner: though in theory it could be done
18:24  skered: Yep

21:55  cham: Hi all, can anyone hel pme please ? i 'd like to strip kbps values from this eliks output  http://pastebin.com/aNL2k4XJ 
21:55  waldner: gsub(/Kbps/,"") ?
21:55  cham: output should be 349 and on a new line 2461
21:56  waldner: oh
21:56  waldner: awk '/^Velocit/{print $3; print $7}'
21:57  cham: waldner: WOW !!!!!!
21:58  cham: waldner: i'm new to linux ... i think it's the future !!!
21:59  waldner: heh
21:59  waldner: it's been "the future" for a while, but I digress
22:01  cham: waldner: you're right but until a month ago I was shure that windows 7 was the best os ! shame on me ! :-)
22:03  waldner: well, not to play the devil's advocate, but awk is available for windows too
22:03  waldner: if you need only that
22:03  waldner: you may want to run linux for other reasons though
22:10  cham: waldner: shure ... i'm running inux and my old P4 is flying with LXDE instead a core2duo with 2GB RAM running vista is very slow it need about 30 secs to open MS InternetExploDer
22:12  cham: just another one question. AWK prints kilobits is thre a way to do  division by 8 to get kilobites ? 
22:12  waldner: awk '/^Velocit/{print $3/8; print $7/8}'
22:12  waldner: maybe rather int($3/8) etc.
22:15  cham: waldner: i was missing int feature. thanks again ... awk is great but its man page is a bit hard to read ! 
22:16  waldner: I suggest you start from one of the documents listed in the channel topic
22:19  steve___: cham: does his first solution not work for you?
