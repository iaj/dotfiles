14:56  pr3d4t0r: Hoi.
15:27  skered: Will awk (or maybe modern awks) page to disk if told to?
15:28  skered: I was thinking of writing an awk program that first reads a file as a lookup table.. then use the second to process and use the lookup table.
15:28  skered: The issue is that what if the first file is large...
15:28  skered: Does it really matter?
15:28  skered: If you store it all in memory.. do it.. otherwise let the OS page
15:29  skered: I'm trying to compare this awk program to say a cobol program that uses an index lookup file to access data.
15:52  Riviera: Sometimes it's possible and then useful to use sqlite for these kind of things.
15:53  Riviera: It can be used quite well on-the-fly.
15:59  skered: Yeah, I was thinking sqlite a while ago but this is a rather limited system because the propability of having something installed are just low.
15:59  skered: So I have to more or less use what's stock or already installed (2003 was the last real install of software)
