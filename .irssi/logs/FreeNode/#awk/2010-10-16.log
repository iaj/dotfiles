13:17  karthee: i want to print all the lines from the first occurance to last occurance of a string . Is there a way to do this using awk ?
13:18  waldner: this is an interesting problem
13:19  waldner: it's trivial with two passes, not so much with a single pass
13:20  karthee: i tried with /regex/,/regex/ .. but it behaves like /regex/ 
13:22  waldner: yes, and even if it did what you think, it would leave out lines if /regex/ can appear many times before the last occurrence
13:22  waldner: or print too much, depending on whether you have odd or even number of occurrences
13:23  waldner: if the regex strictly appears only twice, and you want to print between those instances, sed -n '/regex/,/regex/p' will work
13:26  waldner: also awk '/regex/{if(f)print;f=!f}; f'
13:26  waldner: still assumes two occurrences
13:28  karthee: waldner: wow .. Thanks
13:29  waldner: as I said, it's not a general solution. If it works with your input, then cool
13:29  karthee: waldner: I ll check if it works with my case . Still thanks for the input .. 
13:30  waldner: np
13:49  waldner: awk 'ok||(!ok && /bar/){p[++c]=$0} /bar/{for(i=1;i<=c;i++)print p[i];ok=1;c=0}'
13:50  waldner: though I don't like too much
13:55  waldner: awk '!ok && /bar/{ok=1} ok{p=p s $0;s=RS} /bar/{print p;p=s=""}'
14:33  stockholm: how can i insert lines into xml? awk could do that but i think there must be better programs. i work from a shell script.
14:36  waldner: sure there are better programs
14:36  waldner: xgawk is one, but there also other tools dedicated to xml processing
14:36  waldner: have a look at xmlstarlet
14:51  karthee: i m writing a log analyser. I need to take inputs from user like we do in shell ( sh script.sh arg1 arg2) .. How do I do that in awk ... Ihave a awk program in  i m running it awk script file1 file2 ..
