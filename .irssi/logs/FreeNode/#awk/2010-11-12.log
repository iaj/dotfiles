08:42 --- Channel #awk was synced in 101 seconds
08:55  g0pher: wish this channel had logs for posts - since Freenode requires ideas making my irc client nojoy.
10:12  g0pher: pgas: apology - is there place that #awk channels posts are loged ?
10:12  pgas: I don't think so
10:21  g0pher: is the pits - Ever since freenode required SASL - no way to log posts from #awk channel - must use webchat.freenode.net to read #awk channel.
10:35  g0pher: so how can we get #awk channel to be logged ?
10:38  g0pher: http://irseek.com/  - #freenode said to ask the channel operators to get this channel logged there
10:40  pgas: to find the ops: /msg chanserv access #awk list
10:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#awk +o pr3d4t0r]
10:43  g0pher: pgas - how about getting a log service of this channel - since freenode has denied access to clients without SASL ?
10:43 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: What do you need?
10:44 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Other than the few occasions when I'm not on-line, I have a constant log here from the day that I first joined from this server.
10:44 @pr3d4t0r: ****  Beginning of log  2007 Sep 28 13:36:26  ****
10:44 @pr3d4t0r: 2007 Sep 28 13:48:11  --> newmanbe (n=btdn@tor/regular/newmanbe) has joined #awk
10:44 @pr3d4t0r: When I first landed here.
10:45 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Beware that, unless a channel announces that it's logged, there is legally no way to give you a full log.
10:46 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Comments made in-channel, not announced as logged in public, belong to the person who made the comments and you need permission to reproduce them.
10:46  g0pher: #freenode said http://irseek.com/ is ok If channel ops give permission
10:46  g0pher: eg irseek has logs of freenode #hardware #javascript 
10:47 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: I have no issue with the channel being logged.
10:47  g0pher: Eugene - are your #awk logs available from the internet ?
10:48 * pr3d4t0r smacks g0pher
10:48 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: 1. pr3d4t0r, please.
10:49 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: 2. No, they aren't, for the reason I explained earlier.  If you're looking for a specific conversation, and you were part of it, I will be happy to provide a log.
10:49 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Otherwise, we can start logging forward using irseek.com or whatever.
10:49 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: I could also ask cheeser to bring javabot here.  It has a great UI for searching the logs it produces.
10:51 @pr3d4t0r: g0pher: Think about what you need and let me know in the morning.  I'll be up in ~4 hours.
10:51 @pr3d4t0r: Z z .
11:00  g0pher: pgas: what is your ideas about making this channel logged ?
11:03  g0pher: pr3d4t0r - checked my logs - first re awk
11:03  g0pher: FreeNode-#awk.log**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Sun Apr 24 15:39:47 2005
11:08  pgas: no real use for me, but I'm not against
11:13  g0pher: repost: <g0pher> +jayne: are there any bad issues from having an irc channel logged on http://irseek.com/ ?
11:16  g0pher: pgas: not an issue for you - But for the Many of hundreds of Millions Denied access to freenode since they instigated the SASL policy - we Have Not been able to use our irc client that loggerd posts to disks.
11:21  pgas: not that #awk logs are that interesting
11:25  g0pher: good point - but sometimes things posted here are useful ? do u read the comp.alt.awk newsgroup ?
11:25  g0pher: ment comp.lang.awk ?
11:26  g0pher: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.awk/topics
11:26  pgas: a bit, not regularly
11:27  g0pher: geese - just full of spam - noway to stop that ?
11:28  g0pher: besides http://awk.freeshell.org/HomePage - what is your fav awk site ?
11:29  pgas: use a provider like eternal-september.org and you'll see almost no spam
11:32  g0pher: ment the awk newsgroup  comp.lang.awk
11:33  pgas: yes. eternal-september.org provides free usenet access and the spam is filtered
11:33  g0pher: freenode - 65,000 users - wow - guess that is a Peak - with SASL - that will be down to only a Select few.
11:34  g0pher: Hvae been Banned from the #freenode channel
11:34  pgas: see: http://pastebin.bash-hackers.org/index.php?show=97 
11:35  pgas: no spam
11:53  g0pher: pgas: want to do a simple one page awk for newbies - so many questions here are so basic ?
15:07  g0pher: Have been banned from #freenode for daring say: How will you deal with Verizon ATT Sprint - Will You Ban Them Also ?
15:10  cthuluh: 8)
15:14  g0pher: Issue is IF you are t-mobile - You Have NO acess to freenode 
15:14  g0pher: Agree Doubt freenode Has the Guts to Ban Verizon or ATT - so They Pick on t-mobile to abuse
15:32  cthuluh: hmmm. weird decision
15:33  g0pher: apology - just am hurt that since 2004 freenode was open - Now They Descriminate against us ?
15:48  g0pher: eg are millions of t-mobile users - because of abuses of a few - it is OK to punish us all ?
15:51  cthuluh: to my opinion it's not... unless t-mobile users are really the only ones making trouble. 8)
15:57  g0pher: cthuluh: Yes You Have to realize (/sarcasm on) That T-Mobile Users Are so Much More Smart than Verizon/ATT/Sprint users.
16:32 @pr3d4t0r: So, what was the consensus?  Do we start logging?

23:13  jwillia3: StrikerST, no, it should have given you an error that you tried to print sum.
23:14  StrikerST: so how do I fix it?
23:14  StrikerST: oh wait
23:14  jwillia3: ...by not trying to print sum.
23:14  StrikerST: hey question, is this correct because it outputs nothing  awk '{sum[$1]++} END {for(sender in sum){print sender,sum[%1]}}'
23:14  StrikerST: $1
23:14  jwillia3: %1 doesn't mean anything
23:14  jwillia3: ...
23:14  jwillia3: what is the value of $1 in END?
23:16  StrikerST: its behaving like uniq
23:16  StrikerST: because i have 100000 lines outputed with a number in each line, and I need to sum all off the uniq values you
23:16  StrikerST: *up
23:16  StrikerST: so sum is the count
23:16  jwillia3: that's not what i asked.
