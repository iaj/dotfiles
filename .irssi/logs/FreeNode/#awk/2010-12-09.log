00:04  maj: thx
02:47  krzie: im using this
02:47  krzie:        BALANCE[0]=$(awk -v var="$i" '($1 == var){print $2;exit}' "${aaafigs}.day" |cut -d. -f1)
02:47  krzie: \
02:48  krzie: then in that file i have 2 entries for $1, 21 and 0021
02:48  krzie: but it always uses the first
02:48  krzie: anyone know why / how to fix?
02:50  cthuluh: hmmm
02:50  cthuluh: you mean that when you set i=21
02:51  cthuluh: only lines that begin with "21" match?
02:57  krzie: i set i=21 and 0021 matches
02:58  cthuluh: may I ask you what you're trying to do?
02:58  krzie: sure
02:59  krzie: its a tad bit ugly, but ill pastebin it =]
02:59  cthuluh: please paste shortened code ;)
02:59  krzie: definitely
02:59  krzie: wouldnt burden you with the 300 lines
03:00  krzie: this part is 13 lines
03:00  krzie: http://pastebin.ca/2014393
03:00 * cthuluh runs
03:01  krzie: sorry, i know its ugly
03:01  krzie: oh god i didnt give what is in the input files
03:01  krzie: 1sec ill add that
03:04  krzie: http://pastebin.ca/2014398
03:04  krzie: there that is better
03:04  krzie: the only part that matters is that line 2 and 3 end up displaying 0021's values for 21
03:05  krzie: end up*
03:06  cthuluh: ok, so you want 0021 and 21 to be treated as different?
03:06  krzie: yes
03:06  krzie: exactly
03:06  cthuluh: ($1"" == var) then
03:06  krzie: ahhhh
03:06  krzie: thanx
03:07  cthuluh: yw
03:07  krzie: sorry for making you break out the eye bleach
03:07  krzie: ;]
03:09  krzie: heh, found 23 places in total that i needed to fix that
03:14  krzie: make that 56 =]
03:16  cthuluh: hehe
03:17  KB1JWQ: How do I tell awk to print out everything from $5 to the end of line?
03:17  KB1JWQ: aka strip out $1 through $4
03:25  krzie: awk '{ $1 = ""; $2 = ""; $3 = ""; $4 = ""; print }'
03:25  krzie: that should work... there may be a better way
03:35  KB1JWQ: krzie: Thanks!
03:39  krzie: np
04:21  steve___: 4# echo "1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9" | while read -r _ _ _ _ rest; do printf '%s\n' "$rest"; done
04:21  shbot: steve___: 5  6  7  8  9
04:22  steve___: KB1JWQ: if you have more than one space you might get foo.
04:22  steve___: 4# echo "1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9" | awk '{ $1=""; $2=""; $3=""; $4=""; printf "%s",$0 }'
04:22  shbot: steve___:     5 6 7 8 9
04:23  KB1JWQ: Ah, thanks.
04:24  steve___: KB1JWQ: this will set the spaces to one
04:24  steve___: 4# echo "1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9" | awk '{for (i=5;i<NF;i++) printf "%s ",$i; print $i}'
04:24  shbot: steve___: 5 6 7 8 9
