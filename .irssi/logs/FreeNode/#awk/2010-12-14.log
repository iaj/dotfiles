12:52  bloo_sky: pgas: So gawk might understand it? I'll investigate, thank you.

13:18  pgas: <cthuluh> gawk seems to understand \w
13:19  cthuluh: bloo_sky: ^
13:26  bloo_sky: pgas: but not here. I wonder if there's something different with gawk on OS X. I have: gawk '/^\w{2}\// ...' which doesn't behave the same as: gawk '/^[A-Za-z0-9_]{2}\// ....' 
13:27  pgas: you need --re-interval or --posix or a very new version of gawk to use {2}
13:30  cthuluh: but when you use --posix, \w is not special anymore
13:41  bloo_sky: OK, I have what I want with regular awk, no need for extended (or whatever they are) regex. Thanks for the help.
