17:16  mxcarron: hi
17:17  mxcarron: can i match on a variable content?
17:18  mxcarron: somethink like : gawk -v var=$myvar '/var/ {do_anything}' file ?
17:18  mxcarron: something*
17:21  waldner: you have to match against $0
17:21  mxcarron: ???
17:22  waldner: $0 ~ var {do something}
17:23  mxcarron: why don't i need to write /var/?
17:23  waldner: because that's only for literal patterns
17:23  mxcarron: i though "/" were mandatory
17:24  waldner: nope
17:24  waldner: or yes, but only for literals, as I said already
17:25  mxcarron: ok thx a lot
17:25  waldner: np
