00:07  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Google:  how to eat sushi
00:07  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Click on the first non-video web page link.  Enjoy :)
00:10  vkues: since google results are country-specific, i better ask if you meant http://eugeneciurana.com/musings/sushi-eating-HOWTO.html :)
00:11  vkues: i have the sushipedia app on my iphone 8)
00:11  vkues: pr3d4t0r: do you know of Anthony Bourdain?
00:14  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Yes - and that result is the top on every cuntry we tried so far :)
00:14  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Since 2005.
00:14  vkues: hehe :)
00:14  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I don't like sushipedia.  Quite incomplete.
00:15  pr3d4t0r: vkues: And Anthony Bourdain sounds familiar, but I don't recall what he does.
00:15  vkues: that howto makes me hungry 8)
00:16  vkues: pr3d4t0r: he's not that important in this context, it's just that in one of his "essays" in one of his books he describes his favourite restaurant, his favourite eating experience, in some restaurant in new york by the best sushi chef he knows
00:16  vkues: pr3d4t0r: i liked that text a lot :)
00:16  vkues: but .. well, not that important :)
00:16  pr3d4t0r: vkues: :)
00:17  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The best sushi in the world is eaten in crammed, graceless sushi bars in the Tsukiji Market in Tokyo.  Pure fast food pleasure.
00:18  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I've found good places elsewhere, but Mecca is at Tsukiji :)
00:18  vkues: and they don't only have sushi to offer :)
00:23  vkues: where is it common to be offered chardonnay in a sushi bar?
00:25  cthuluh: is that a real question? if so, I'd answer in france
00:28  vkues: yes, real question
00:28  vkues: cthuluh: it's mentioned in the howto
00:28  vkues: well, when i asked i thought it might also be something japanese, but that was surely quite dumb :)
00:31  pr3d4t0r: vkues: In western countries.  It's actually not a bad combination.
00:31  pr3d4t0r: vkues: You want to drink something crisp and refreshing.  Beer is optimal.
00:31  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Dry beers.
00:31  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Cold sakes are OKi.
00:32  pr3d4t0r: vkues: White wines are good, but they can be a bad sign of a yuppie joint :)
00:33  vkues: hehe
00:38  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I'm reworking the HOWTO because after visiting Japan a few times I realized something fundamental:  sushi is fast food.
00:39  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The HOWTO makes it sound as elitist at times, mostly because it was intended for non-Japanese peeps.  I want to change that.
00:39  vkues: ah
00:39  vkues: yes, that sounds smart
00:39  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I guess I had a "moment of clarity" recently.
00:39  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Plus I have about 25 photos (maybe more?) of things that need to be documented :)
00:39  vkues: hehe
00:39  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I'm also working on a Fugu Eating HOWTO.
00:39  vkues: bragger 8)
00:40  vkues: seriously, i am jealous :)
00:40  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Heh.
00:40  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The good one, if I can pull that project off, will be the Whale Eating HOWTO and round table.
00:40  vkues: publish it :)
00:41  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The idea is to publish the HOWTO, then have a round table with Trevor Corson, Paul Greenberg, and me.
00:41  vkues: 8)
00:42  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I suspect that Trevor will be the anti-whale hunting for moral reasons guy, Paul I know will be the won't eat whale because I'm culturally conditioned to avoid it, and I'll be the whale is fucking delicious, mon, and I see nothing wrong in hunting whales that aren't endangered.
00:42  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Bring me more steaks!
00:42  vkues: don't daydream it, do it, and keep me updated :)
00:42  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I don't have time :)
00:43  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Plus it has to feel right in the gut.
00:43  vkues: if that'd be true, we'd all still live in caves
00:43  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I'm almost there.  Trevor and I correspond often.  Paul I haven't met.
00:43  vkues: :)
00:43  vkues: nice
00:43  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The gotcha is meeting Paul.  Once I'm over that hurdle we can make the next step happen quickly.
00:44  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I want to get NYT to run it.  That'd be a fun forum.
00:44  vkues: have your text reviewed in the new york review of books
00:44  vkues: that should open all doors 8)
00:45  pr3d4t0r: vkues: They suck - they turned down one of my books.  It still became an Amazon best-seller for a couple of weeks, so they can suck it.
00:45  pr3d4t0r: vkues: But yeah, it'd be nice.
00:45  vkues: which one? :)
00:45  vkues: and, why did they? :)
00:45  pr3d4t0r: vkues: http://teslatestament.com
00:47  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Because it came from a small publisher in San Francisco.  We still managed to do great at BookExpo America and other venues, so I'm OKi with that.
00:47  pr3d4t0r: Anyway, gotta run.
00:47  vkues: cheers
00:47  pr3d4t0r: vkues: Cheers!
00:47 * pr3d4t0r left.
00:47  pr3d4t0r: Almost 0300  ::sigh::.
00:47  pr3d4t0r: Gotta... finish... this...
00:49  pr3d4t0r: Heh - I'd forgotten about Joan Tesla.  I have a photo with her.
00:49  pr3d4t0r: vkues: http://www.myspace.com/ciurana/blog/124656328
00:49  vkues: :D
00:49  vkues: a few months ago i was at nikola tesla airport ;)
00:50  vkues: but i did not take a photo ;-P
00:50  vkues: :))
00:51  vkues: pr3d4t0r: for some reason the images give 404s
00:56  pr3d4t0r: vkues: It looks like MySpace moved my blog around :\
00:56  pr3d4t0r: vkues: It also lost the formatting.
00:56  pr3d4t0r: vkues: The original colour scheme matched the book web site and my MySpace page.
00:57  pr3d4t0r: vkues: This is what it was supposed to look like:  http://www.myspace.com/ciurana
00:57  vkues: ah, so it's not my browser plugins messing with the layout
00:59  vkues: pr3d4t0r: read "Passenger to Frankfurt" from Agatha Christie ;)
00:59  vkues: i got the impression that you might quite like that book :)
01:01  pr3d4t0r: vkues: I'll look for it :)
01:01  pr3d4t0r: OKi, back to work.
01:02  pr3d4t0r: Z z .
01:02  vkues: :)

23:36  gionnico: hi
23:36  gionnico: how can i tokenize a string like this
23:36  gionnico:         array_nom_imagen[113]="pc6weVgDghZfL"
23:37  gionnico: and print stuff inside "" ?
23:37  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: How many of those do you have?
23:37  cthuluh: awk -F \" '{ print $2 }'
23:37  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: one for each line
23:38  cthuluh: might be not sufficient, but it works  :)
23:38  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: That looks like Python, C, or Ruby.
23:38  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: it's from a javascript. i'm parsing some html
23:38  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Probably Python.
23:38  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: OKi.
23:38  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Are we fairly sure that = and the opening " are at least always on the same line?
23:38  cthuluh: ouch, parsing javascript contained into html...
23:39  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: ;)
23:39  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: That's why I asked.
23:39  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: yes the js is generated automatically by some other script
23:39  gionnico: so until the webpage change but this is always the case with "net bots"
23:39  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Try cthuluh's suggestion first and see if that works.
23:39  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: yes seems it's working
23:39  gionnico: :)
23:39  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: If not, then we need to build a safety net.
23:40  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Lke, we need to ignore all the HTML crap on that page and so on.
23:41  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: i always did that with a brute grep
23:41  gionnico: s/always/already
23:41  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Heh.
23:41  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Then you aren't sure if you caught them all :)
23:41  cthuluh: don't use grep, you have awk
23:41  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Exactly.
23:42  gionnico: how would you write this
23:42  gionnico: grep 'array_nom_imagen\[[0-9][0-9]*\]' index.htm
23:42  cthuluh: I deny all responsibility for having given that "solution". if you use it like that, it will break. soon
23:43  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: I'd break that down somewhat.
23:43  gionnico: cthuluh: when you write net bots you have to rewrite when the website change. if you had an intelligent browser "plugin" it would never break
23:44  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: In awk it'd be /array_nom_imagen\[[0-9][0-9]*\]/ just to get those lines.
23:44  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: But there are potential nasties that can appear there.  For example, the generator may have multiple of those lines per line.
23:45  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Since both the HTML and the JavaScript will be free form, and white space isn't significant in either, I'd break this into steps and have a couple of awk functions to deal with the actual extraction to ensure that you always get the real McCoy.
23:46  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: The grep + awk approach, as it sits right now, breaks if you have two array_nom_imagen assignments on the same line, or if it ends up across multiple lines, or embedded in the middle of some HTML/script tag, or... lots of mland mines to worry about.
23:47  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: So - I'd just first scan for any line that contains the variable name.  Then parse that complete line using match() or something like that.  Just break it down in components.
23:47  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: The main goal of this would be to figure out enough processing logic to always get rid of anything you don't want first, then analyze the line last.  Does that make sense?
23:48  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Pitch in, man!  The responsibility is enormous.
23:48  gionnico: yes
23:48  gionnico: pr3d4t0r: i could remove what's before the comment "start js" and "end js" (there's something like that)
23:48  gionnico: anyways the website foresee use of automated stuff so i hope they keep the "api" stable enough
23:49  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Famous last words... :)
23:49  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Your approach is sound.  Do you know how to do thatÇ
23:49  pr3d4t0r: ?
23:50  gionnico: "sound" ?
23:50  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: Guessing some of the stuff you may need to do is hard without having sample  text.
23:50  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: "sound" == "good" in colloquial English :)
23:51  gionnico: hmm i'd use head and tail
23:54  pr3d4t0r: gionnico: awk '/start js/ { bParse = 1; } /end js/ { bParse = 0; } bParse && /array_nom_imagen/ { /* do your magic here */ }'
