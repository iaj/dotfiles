04:51  k[t: OK!

04:51  shbot: k[t: no output
04:58  g0pher: k - why the bash shell fails
04:59  k[t: cause i fail..
04:59  probonono: 4# echo | awk 'BEGIN { system("ls") }'
04:59  shbot: probonono: no output
05:00  probonono: 4# awk 'BEGIN { system("ls -a") }'
05:00  shbot: probonono: .  ..
05:00  k[t: 4# awk 'BEGIN { system("echo *") }'
05:00  shbot: k[t: *
05:01  k[t: hahahaha
05:01  k[t: ok, enough abuse... sry admins...
05:04  k[t: oops... it does work... so ps for example to remove the title ... would be something like ... ps <opts> | awk 'END { for( x=2 ; x<=NR ; x++ ) { print $0 } }'
05:04  k[t: but i just confused myself...
05:05  k[t: wait wrong.. nvm...
05:06  g0pher: k - 4# not a very good bot eg
05:07  k[t: kk...
05:08  g0pher: 4# awk -v s=F-Word\\040With\\040A\\040Large\\040Wood\\040spoon 'BEGIN{print(s)}'
05:08  shbot: g0pher: F-Word With A Large Wood spoon
05:09  g0pher: 4# awk -v s=F-Word\\040You\\040With\\040A\\040Large\\040Wood\\040spoon 'BEGIN{print(s)}'
05:09  shbot: g0pher: F-Word You With A Large Wood spoon
05:13  g0pher: whereas in DOS is so simple
05:13  g0pher: C:\!> awk -v s=F-Word\040You\040With\040A\040Large\\040Wood\040spoon BEGIN{print (s)} F-Word You With A Large\040Wood spoon
05:15  g0pher: C:\!> awk -v s=F-Word\040You\040With\040A\040Large\040Wood\040spoon BEGIN{print( s)} F-Word You With A Large Wood spoon
05:15  g0pher: F-Word You With A Large Wood spoon
05:20  k[t: er... ps -C proc -f | awk 'if( NR ~ /[2-9]/) { print $0 ... wait even if(NR > 1) ... crap im confused again..
05:20  k[t: i'm outta here...
05:20  k[t: oh yea, one strange thing that got the behavior i want but do not understand is the use of getline...
05:21  g0pher: <k[t> no is ok
05:21  k[t: ps -C BitchX -f  | awk '{ while((getline) > 0) { print $0 } }'
05:22  k[t: g0pher... no???
05:23  k[t: just preserving lines for futher manipulation while truncating the title...
