17:48  kaushal: Hi
17:48  kaushal: Hi
17:49  kaushal: is strtonum function available in awk ?
17:49  kaushal: I believe its available in gawk
17:49  kaushal: Please suggest
17:49  taylanub: did you RTFM?
17:50  kaushal: taylanub: nope
17:50  Riviera: kaushal: See the gawk manual for this.
17:50  kaushal: Riviera: yeah i am aware of it
17:50  Riviera: kaushal: am not sure if you really are, please wait a second,
17:51  kaushal: so i need to install gawk application to get strtonum function ?
17:52  taylanub: what exactly does strtonum() do?
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: ah, right.
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: So, what I meant when I said
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: "See the gawk manual for this."
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: was not
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: RTFM
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: but rather the following:
17:52  Riviera: kaushal: 1) In the gawk documentation is explicitly stated that this indeed is a gawk extension.
17:52  kaushal: can it be avoided ?
17:53  Riviera: kaushal: 2) In the gawk documentation you'll find an alternative implementation of the strtonum function for other versions of awk.
17:53  Riviera: kaushal: that is, here:
17:53  Riviera: kaushal: http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Strtonum-Function
17:53  kaushal: Riviera: is there a equivalent function available in awk
17:54 * taylanub did RTFM. -- that's a fancy function
17:54  kaushal: basically i do not want to install gawk
17:54  kaushal: we need to use function strtonum to convert hex values to ascii. which is defined in gawk and not awk
17:54  kaushal: is that true
17:55  kaushal: some user came to me and reported this to use gawk
17:55  kaushal: please correct me
17:56  Riviera: kaushal: do you even take the time to read what I wrote?
17:56  kaushal: Riviera: sure
17:57  kaushal: let me go through it again
17:57  Riviera: 17:53 <Riviera> kaushal: http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Strtonum-Function
17:58  Riviera: The gawk documentation provides an implementation of the function you want (strtonum)
17:58  Riviera: for other versions of awk.
17:58  Riviera: That are not gawk
17:58  Riviera: So, with this you can use your awk and have the strtonum function.

22:39  pr3d4t0r: n=1; while ((n != 0)); do wget -t 1 -T 5 'http://69.162.150.162/230947/sdpoijf/09348xn5/Girl_Talk_-_All_Day_(IA123)_mp3s.zip'; n="$?"; done - is there a better way to accomplish this?  Thanks in advance.
22:39  pr3d4t0r: pgas: ^^^ :)
22:48  cthuluh: until wget -t 1 ...;  do sleep 60; done
22:49  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: Yeah, I saw that from nDuff in #bash - thank you.
22:50  cthuluh: oh true :)
22:50  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: This is not the whole command.  I'm carrying out more operations based on whether wget failed or succeeded.  I appreciate it, though :)
22:50  cthuluh: you're welcome
22:51  pr3d4t0r: cthuluh: I've been doing too much Python recently and I missed the while and until syntaxes.  Rusty here ;)
