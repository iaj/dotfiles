02:42  rocktop: any way to parse apache config file to get ServerName and its Documentroot  for each virtualhost entry ?
03:51  steve___: rocktop: can you post some sample data and the desired output?
03:54  rocktop: steve___, I have too many virtualhosts entry look like http://pastebin.com/D9NGcctS each entry defined from  <VirtualHost  to </VirtualHost> I need to capture ServerName domaitup.com and DocumentRoot /home/domaincom/public_html  for each one entry in same line 
03:59  steve___: awk '/ServerName|DocumentRoot/'
03:59  steve___: like that?

04:20  steve___: rocktop: lynx -dump http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=D9NGcctS | awk '/ServerName/ {printf "%s ",$2} /DocumentRoot/ {print $2}'

19:35  qwerty: hello, i have two lines: first 'aa bb', secord 'aa cc' and i need on output line 'aa bb cc', how can i do it ? has awk some cheats, without loop comparing every line ?
19:37  yitz_: Do you have an algorithm to produce that output?
19:39  pgas: awk 'NR==FNR{a[$1]=$0;next} $1 in a {print a[$1],$2}' file1 file2
19:39  pgas: http://awk.freeshell.org/ComparingTwoFiles
19:41  qwerty: wow
19:44  qwerty: my idea is http://pastebin.com/hzDNXWKY
19:44  qwerty: something like...
19:44  qwerty: pgas, thanx
19:47  pgas: well, it's similar, but you use the array in a backward manner
19:47  pgas: the NR==FNR{     ;next} is just a tricky way to write your first loop
19:55  qwerty: pgas, but how can i parse two stdout's with your script ?
19:55  qwerty: without using files
20:02  pgas: well, you mean 2 stdin
20:02  pgas: and there is only one stdin
20:03  pgas: assuming bash, you can do: awk  '...... ' <(cmd1) <(cmd2)
20:04  qwerty: nice trick :)
20:04  pgas: but you might prefer using  cmd2 | awk 'BEGIN{while ( ( "cmd1" | getline) >0) a[$1]=$0} $1 in a {print a[$1],$2}'
20:04  qwerty: on bsd sh no other ways ?
20:05  qwerty: thats what i need man.
20:05  qwerty: :) thanx again
20:05  pgas: you can also use a named pipe to achieve the same thing as <(cmd1)
20:05  qwerty: named pipe ?
20:07  pgas: mkfifo foo;cmd1 >foo & cmd2 | awk '    ' foo -
20:08  qwerty: oh, fifos... fifo=file, not my way ;)
20:08  pgas: uh?
20:08  qwerty: i need to remove it after script execution ?
20:09  pgas: yes
20:09  qwerty: thats my problem :)
20:09  pgas: ah
20:09  qwerty: thanx pgas, now i know how to use this tricks
20:10 * qwerty going to sleep mode.
20:37  lordgreg: hi all. i'm having difficulties printing directories with spaces with awk like this (prints date+directory name. ends after 1st word if it has spaces) --> ls -ltd /home/Public/@Trash/*/ | head -n 5 | awk 'BEGIN {print "Datum\t\t Naslov\n---\t\t ---";}{print $7, $6, $8, "\t", $9;}' <--- $9 being obviously 1st word in directory with spaces. Is there such thing as just typing $9+ or something?
20:47  lordgreg: well i dont think the answer is 42 here, i tried that already o_O
20:47  Dmole: lordgreg: find what you are looking for?
20:48  lordgreg: hi all. i'm having difficulties printing directories with spaces with awk like this (prints date+directory name. ends after 1st word if it has spaces) --> ls -ltd /home/Public/@Trash/*/ | head -n 5 | awk 'BEGIN {print "Datum\t\t Naslov\n---\t\t ---";}{print $7, $6, $8, "\t", $9;}' <--- $9 being obviously 1st word in directory with spaces. Is there such thing as just typing $9+ or something?
20:49  Dmole: lordgreg: IMO perl regex is better for that  | perl -p -e 's/someregex/$1nstugg/g'
20:49  lordgreg: oh dear :$
20:50  Dmole: can you give example input and expected output?
20:50  lordgreg: sure
20:50  cthuluh: there's one big problem here: you're relying on the output of ls
20:51  cthuluh: ls is just meant to be used interactively, not in scripts
20:51  lordgreg: ls -ltd and head -n 5 would print latest 5 directories sorted by modified date
20:51  lordgreg: i see
20:52  cthuluh: this can give you hints about how to print "$9+": http://awk.freeshell.org/RangeOfFields
20:52  cthuluh: but the main problem is the use of ls
20:52  Dmole: cthuluh: are you saying he should use a "for FILES in %FOLDER/*" ?
20:53  cthuluh: see this: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/099
20:53  Dmole: I'll take that as a yes
20:54  lordgreg: ah, i understand. but why is using ls -t unsfae? 
20:55  cthuluh: because of this: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
20:55 * cthuluh loves wooledge.org
20:56  lordgreg: ouch
20:56  lordgreg: ty for your help

21:16  cthuluh: oh, he left :(
21:16  cthuluh: I was afk
21:16  Riviera: :(
21:17  steve___: cthuluh: Pretty sure it was because you didn't end your sentences with m'Lord.
21:18  cthuluh: 8)
21:19  cthuluh: had an idea using find /bla -type d -printf '%A@\a%p\0' -prune | sort -z -f 1 -t '\a' | { i=0; while IFS=$'\a' read -rd '' time file && ((i++ < 5)); do printf '%s\n' "$file"; done; }
21:19  Riviera: :O
21:19  cthuluh: rather GNU specific 8)
21:19  Riviera: Crazy shit.
21:19  Riviera: Did not know Unix can do that.
21:24  cthuluh: all this to find the 5 most recently modified directories
21:25  geirha: You mean most recently accessed
21:25  Riviera: Read your Heisenberg.
21:25  geirha: You're sorting on atime...
21:26  geirha: Btw, / is a safer delimiter
21:26  Riviera: Or just \0
21:27  Riviera: reading twice, etc.
21:27  cthuluh: oh yeah, %A != mtime
21:27  Riviera: Actually, was moronic to say that, please nevermind. :)
21:27  cthuluh: bah, I find \a rather safe :)
21:27  Riviera: cthuluh: Yes.
21:27  Riviera: cthuluh: Because you're a GNU guy.
21:28  Riviera: cthuluh: Never downloading anything pirated.
21:28  cthuluh: Ã´O
21:28  cthuluh: I don't understand how it can be related to piracy :)
21:28  Riviera: cthuluh: But there are others, poor people who suffer from morons who cannot create sane filenames before they create their torrents.
21:29  cthuluh: yes, but here I'm sure that the epoch won't contain \a
21:29  geirha: Still, / is easier to type :P
21:29  cthuluh: indeed, geirha :)
21:29  Riviera: :O
21:29  Riviera: You guys actually type?
21:29  Riviera: 8)
21:30  cthuluh: no, but some on freenode actually do it
21:31  geirha: Advanced.BASH.Scripting.GUIDE.The.S01E01.PR0PER.FiXeD.LOL.rar.torrent
21:31  geirha: You mean those names, Riviera?
21:31  cthuluh: argl
21:32  Riviera: geirha: well, those too :) But rather I meant the filenames within the .rar :)
21:33  geirha: Inside it you'll find BashGuide.pdf, of course, the wooledge guide :)
21:34  Riviera: smart move .)
21:34  cthuluh: geirha: CAN I HAZ THE BASHGUIDE, PLZ? TY
21:35  geirha: I HAS A VAR
21:35  cthuluh: WATZ IN A VAR? :>
21:35  geirha: KTHXBYE
21:36  cthuluh: LOLZ
21:36  Riviera: xmbify <<< 'don'\'' tempt me to write this filter :)'
21:37  geirha: You don't like LOLCODE, Riviera?
21:37  Riviera: Good question.
21:37  Riviera: Yes, I like it a lot.
21:37  Riviera: Maybe not like-like, but at least finding it interesting enough.
21:37  Riviera: I rather was asking you to
21:38  Riviera: applaud
21:38  Riviera: for the idea of having an xmb filter.
21:38  geirha: Riviera: Which way will it work? From or to xmb?
21:39  cthuluh: tr -d '\\z' # you're done
21:39  Riviera: geirha: to
21:39  cthuluh: oh
21:39  geirha: Riviera: Forgive me for not applauding :P
21:40  Riviera: :(
21:40  Riviera: mh.
21:40  Riviera: geirha: ... and from? :)
21:40  Riviera: no no.
21:41  Riviera: I wonder why "from" doesn't really interest me.
21:41  geirha: Well, would be interesting to see what he's actually trying to say, but I believe it's impossible.
21:42  cthuluh: you guys are so mean to him :(
21:42  Riviera: I don't think I am.

21:42  Riviera: Well.
21:43  Riviera: <alek{xmb}{bottz}> if u do not understand then reread or refrase your understanding
21:43  geirha: Oh, he really put http: in front there?
21:44  geirha: !+ +!  seems to be some sort of quoting
21:45  steve___: Have you guys clicked on the url?
21:46  Riviera: I read the document ,yes.
21:48  steve___: I assume you're using the work "read" loosely, otherwise I vote "from"  ;)
