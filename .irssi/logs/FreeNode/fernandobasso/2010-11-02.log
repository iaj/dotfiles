13:26 iaj: hey
13:26 iaj: is it okay to write in prviate?
13:26 iaj: or.. not? :)
13:26 FernandoBasso: Okay.
13:26 iaj: :-))   One question - can you maybe share a screen of one of yoru files formated with txtfmt
13:27 iaj: And, when you create a file that ought to be highlighted someway - by txtfmt - how do you usually proceed?
13:27 FernandoBasso: I am learning it myself. I don't have a very defined way to do it yet.
13:27 iaj: heh... :-)
13:27 FernandoBasso: I'm not vim expert myself.
13:28 iaj: is it able to highlight urls automatically
13:28 iaj: or does it need further tweaking
13:28 iaj: yeh.. ive been vimming for one year now
13:28 iaj: and theres just
13:28 iaj: such a large bunch to learn
13:28 FernandoBasso: You choose the colors you want.
13:28 FernandoBasso: Not automatically.
13:28 iaj: Ohhh ok :(
13:28 iaj: I wanted to have urls highlighted automaticcaly
13:31 FernandoBasso: http://imagebin.ca/view/iVtCvSej.html
13:31 iaj: hah... wow

13:33 FernandoBasso: This plugin is a MUST for people like me, who loves doing everything *with* vim.

13:43 iaj: heh, yeah..well I love vim as well and try it to use wherether I can
13:43 iaj: even get textfields from firefox and stuff into vim
13:43 iaj: change them
13:43 iaj: and take m back
13:43 iaj: heh
13:44 FernandoBasso: Are you a web developer?
13:44 iaj: the only prob im frightened if there are too many plugins in the background
13:44 iaj: that its lacking speed
13:44 iaj: yeah
13:44 iaj: why?
13:44 FernandoBasso: I'm learning web programming. 
13:45 FernandoBasso: I'm am also afraid of having so many plugins. But generally, they do not cause problems.
13:45 FernandoBasso: Also, not all plugins are loaded all the time.
13:46 FernandoBasso: I've been fighting with my brain for quite a while to find efficient way of learning and memorizing things.

13:55 iaj: heh.. yeah... brain is the one thing
13:56 iaj: but the more important and .. this takes a much longer time
13:56 iaj: is to get it into ones fingers
13:56 iaj: muscle memory :)
13:56 iaj: I had my escape key mapped to capslock
13:56 iaj: and now I got control mapped to capslock - that really is annoying... until now :)
13:57 FernandoBasso: Yes. When something becomes automatic.
13:57 FernandoBasso: I'm far away from this 'last level' of programming skill.
13:58 FernandoBasso: I don't care very much about <Esc>. I trained my self to use ^[ instead.
14:00 iaj: yeah - that's the thing Im currently learning as well
14:00 iaj: I was at jj meanwhile
14:00 iaj: but - its just not as good :)

16:18 FernandoBasso: It'd be nice to see you here.
16:20 FernandoBasso: Sent.
16:20 FernandoBasso: Be careful. They have the dot in the name. .vimrc and .gvimrc.
16:20 FernandoBasso: Be careful not to override your own files.
16:23 iaj: hehe thanks man
16:23 iaj: lemme take a look at those
16:23 iaj: they are called .vimrc.txt tho :)
16:24 FernandoBasso: What? gmail renamed the files?
16:24 iaj: ye
16:24 FernandoBasso: I didn't know that.
16:25 iaj: :-0
16:25 iaj: your autocommands show me
16:25 iaj: that you do web devel as well
16:25 FernandoBasso: As I said, I'm learning...
16:25 FernandoBasso: Takes some time.
16:26 FernandoBasso: I find css more difficult than php/sql/jquery. It should be the easier one. Not for me, and I can't figure out why.
16:26 iaj: :-) yeah
16:27 iaj: really? what's so difficult about css?
16:27 iaj: i hope you use firebug :)
16:27 FernandoBasso: I don't know. Positioning things is hell for me.
16:27 FernandoBasso: Just the 'positioning' part. Not the rest.
16:27 FernandoBasso: I use firebug. But the basics of the basics of it.

16:35 iaj: i usually put the stuff on the page... then Im bugging with firebug in order to place it
16:35 iaj: then put the stuff to my css file
16:36 FernandoBasso: That seems a smart approach. I never thought about doing it that way.
16:36 iaj: trust me.. that's worth it
16:37 iaj: even tho netrw makes things a lot easier
16:37 iaj: since you can just hit :w .. tab to firefox
16:37 iaj: refresh
16:37 iaj: and see how it goes
16:38 FernandoBasso: You open a firefox tab with the file you are editing when you :write it?
16:38 iaj: basically I just fill in the html data.. and do all the rest of the stuff by editing the css fail mainly
16:38 iaj: i have html and css open in split window in vim
16:38 iaj: then I fire up the html on my firefox
16:39 iaj: and yeah.. but I thought about creating a mapping that's focusing and refreshing firefox
16:39 iaj: from within vim
16:39 iaj: which is possilbe with goddamn applescript
