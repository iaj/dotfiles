14:09 kevke: ya
14:09 kevke: are you running a server, or just a site?
14:12 iaj: mhhh what do you mean.. just a site
14:13 kevke: The server, where your site is on, is it yours, or do you have just a portion of webspace on it
14:14 iaj: Ahh I just have a portion of webspace on it)
14:17 kevke: I see... do you want the link to be completely automatic and random, each time the website is opened, or should the link be solid so that you can giv it away
14:17 iaj: is both possible?
14:17 iaj: giv it away atm :)
14:18 kevke: with the proper tools yes
14:19 iaj: oh... alright :)
14:19 iaj: can you tell me how I can create such a link that should be permanent stuck to a page?
14:20 kevke: first one would be a session ID secont one is like bit.ly
14:21 iaj: bit.ly wouldn't have my page as a link , my domain I mean
14:21 iaj: how would the part with a session ID work?
