16:31  moka: Hi all, why this .tex doesn't compile http://ideone.com/yVw2Z (pdflatex gives me "Undefined control sequence.  l.24 \lstset {language=C}") while this one http://ideone.com/3r1Rv compile well? Where is the mistake?
16:41  marcellus: listings
16:41  marcellus: not listing
16:53  moka: marcellus, ahah thank you 
16:59  j2quinn: anyone here use achemso?
17:13  marcellus: ,ask
17:13  fsbot: I heard ask is [0]  Go ahead and ask :-) ... and some one will try to help.. if not right now, whenever they happen to wander over to the computer
17:13  fsbot: [1] don't ask to ask and don't ask if someone has or can. Just ask your question and everybody will be happy ;-)
17:19  j2quinn: well, achemso is setting that the first paragraph of any \section or \subsection is not indented. i wanted to remove this. i want all paragraphs indented. any ideas how?
17:19  j2quinn: is setup that the*
18:36  mahamoti: im using multicol package and want a single-column figure. i use \begin{figure}[H] ... \end{figure} because multicol does not support floats, BUT the figure floats to the end of the document anyway!
18:46  sirkew: Why are there not a channel for Lyx?
19:02  HT: sirkew: you can always start one, I suppose
19:58  bobnormal: hi there, i am using LyX and citing a .bib database.  is there a pre-made 'style' available that turns citations in to "[BIBTEX-KEY1999]" in the output?
20:09  bobnormal: it seems that either 'draft' or 'debug' styles will operate like this
20:09  bobnormal: however neither are present in LyX 2.0beta

20:38  secondhand: How do you go about right justifying the right column in the proc document class?
20:43  marcellus: column?
20:54  secondhand: it's alright, the issue was i had raggedright set 
21:03  peleg: Indentation works not so good here. I am using Babel, and switching using \foreignlanguage in the middle of a paragraph. The RTL text appears indented, as if it was a new paragraph, instead of just being aligned to the right edge of the paragraph. Any ideas?
21:26 --- jdiaz is now known as |Zz|
21:26  peleg: ok, so simpler question: how, in general, can I force a movement of a word to some direction?
21:27  |Zz|: which direction? vertical or horizontal?
21:28  peleg: horizontal.
21:28  |Zz|: \kern <distance>
21:28  |Zz|: eg, \kern 5mm
21:28  peleg: My problem is that after switching to RTL, the word begins too much to the left, as if it was a new paragraph, indented.
21:28  peleg: |Zz|, is "kern" different from "hspace"?
21:28  |Zz|: I have no idea about RTL scripts
21:29  |Zz|: but yes, kern is different. hspace can be ignored (or absorbed by other spaces around). kern is not
21:29  bobnormal: peleg: which language, out of interest.  arabic or hebrew maybe?
21:29  peleg: hebrew
21:30  bobnormal: good luck!  i might try chinese RTL
21:30  peleg: hebrew
21:30  peleg: |Zz|, it looks like after the \hfill{} \kern -1in is ignored.
21:32  peleg: though, I think I have found something...
21:35  |Zz|: hm.. \hfill expands to fill all available horizontal space. I guess that infinite minus 1in is still infinite
21:38  peleg: thanks!
21:39  |Zz|: perhaps you can cancel the \hfill with \hfillneg
21:44  madsj: hi; with the url-package, it is very easy to customize the font and appearence of a url. How can this be done with the hyperref-package?
21:45  madsj: I just wish to change the size a bit to \small
21:45  madsj: I have RTFM'ed a bit, but no luck :-(
