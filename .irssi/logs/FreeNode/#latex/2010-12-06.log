01:24  bosie: is there a nifty trick to introduce horizontal spacing between two rows in tabular?
01:25  |Zz|: \\[1cm]
01:25  bosie: |Zz|: i forgot to add: i have a horizontal line with either \hline or \cline
01:26  |Zz|: where do you want the space then? before or after the \hline?
01:26  bosie: |Zz|: currently i am looking for after
01:26  bosie: but i am pretty sure i would need before too in the very near future
01:27  bosie: though before i am using \\[0.3in] atm
01:29  |Zz|: what about \\ \hline\\[1cm] ?
01:29  |Zz|: that is, 0.3in
01:29  bosie: that doesn't work
01:29  |Zz|: it works, but it adds also the normal inter-row space
01:29  bosie: that would introduce \\ + a 1cm break
01:29  |Zz|: yes
01:29  bosie: exactly
01:29  |Zz|: well, you have to fine-tune the amount in brackets
01:30  |Zz|: you can use negative values
01:30  bosie: hm true
01:30  bosie: i can't remember why but i actually
01:30  bosie: rejected that approach a while ago (the negative value one)
01:33  |Zz|: another way is to begin the next line with \vrule width 0mm height 1cm 
01:34  |Zz|: to have a cleaner input, you can \def\extravspace#1{\vrule width 0mm height #1}, and begin the row with \extravspace{1cm}
01:36  bosie: |Zz|: alright, thanks, i will make that work
01:39  bosie: thanks |Zz|

02:44  MrKeuner: hello, what is the difference between array versus align environments?
02:47  |Steve|: One is for making arrays of numbers, the other is for aligning equations.
02:50  MrKeuner: thanks

03:55  mariano|syzygy: btm, I meant that I created the savebox with  \newsavebox, not \newbox

06:44  mariano|syzygy: yeah
06:45  mariano|syzygy: (texdoc endnotes,  does the trick :) )
06:45  Durandal21: Looks like if you'd like to convert all the footnotes to endnotes, you could put \let\footnote=\endnote in your preamble. Handy.
06:58  Veronika: hi, anybody active?
07:01  Durandal21: somewhat
07:02  Veronika: :)
07:03  Durandal21: How goes?
07:03  Veronika: could you please recommen me some way to force LateX put 2 images on 1 page.... there is also some text in the middle, [h!] parameter do not have an effect
07:06  Durandal21: Hmmm. If they don't need to be on THAT page, just on the same page, you could try telling it to put them on a float page.
07:06  Durandal21: Or put the images inside the same minipage environment, perhaps?
07:07  Durandal21: brb
07:09  Veronika: i just need to have that picture exactly there in text
07:10  Veronika: ok
07:19  Veronika: i really dont know how, but have fixed that... added \pagebreak before new subsection
07:41  regebro: Possibly Stupid Question: Can I use a normal font package (like fouriernc) together with the fontspec package? If so how?
07:43  pico: what do you mean my `normal' ?
07:44  regebro: pico: Well, one that sets the font to something.
07:44  regebro: Like fourierenc.
07:44  pico: like cmr10?
07:46  regebro: Well, I can't find that package, so I can't verify.  But the types of package you have here: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/
07:47  regebro: pico: I use fonstpec, and selected Century Schoolbok L, but I don't get ligatures. With fourienc I do, but that replaces *all* my fonts, not just the main/roman one.
07:48  pico: regebro, did you specify that you wanted ligatures?
07:48  pico: do you mean tex ligatures?
07:48  regebro: pico: Yes, I said \defaultfontfeatures to set ligatures, which made no difference, because that's default.
07:49  regebro: pico: As I uderstand TeX ligatures are things like using -- for mdash, so no.
07:49  pico: use tlig
07:49  pico: Ligatures=TeX
07:49  pico: it's *not* default with fontenc
07:50  pico: (fontspec i mean)
07:50  regebro: pico: OK, I tried, and got an error, hang on...
07:51  pico: regebro, do you compile with either lualatex or xelatex?
07:52  regebro: pico: Yeah, xelatex.
07:52  pico: you'd better use lua. anyway, you need another option then.
07:53  pico: Mapping=tex-text i think
07:53  regebro: OK, see if I can try luatex, then.
07:53  pico: not sure though, havent use xelatex for a while.
07:55  regebro: Damn... "XeTeX is required to compile this document"... 
07:58  regebro: Pfew.... Am I really going to put down another day of understanding the internals of this to get ligatures? I don't know, I have to think about it.

12:39  Manny: hi. with documentclass article, 9pt options, and palatino fonts -- what is the default baselineskip, in pt.? My diploma thesis supervisor (who happens to be a TeX guru) gave me a great hint to use a certain baselineskip, and I want to know the absolute size of the skip
12:39  Manny: "to use a certain baselineskip" = "to use a certain baselinestretch"
12:47  kahen_desktop: last time i checked, 9pt is not a valid option so article? 
12:49  Manny: kahen_desktop, it seemed to work on the particular LaTeX installation though -- I also used \DeclareMathSizes{9}{9}{7}{5}
12:55  hiwk: djoef: I do't know about your installation problem, haven't done that myself. 
12:56  hiwk: djoef: as for your date-of-creation thing, I'm not sure that is possible. Try to hard-code the date upon creation. 
12:56  djoef: hiwk, thanks that is how i do it now
12:56  djoef: about the link, weird that it doesn't work :(
12:57  fixl: in the letter documentclass, how do i get the date to be left aligned rather then right?
13:00  djoef: TEXMFHOME is defined and works, I just added !!$TEXMFHOME to TEXMF and TEXDBS I see it updates the ls-R file.. still doesn't find the sty file

14:24  maieul: hello
14:24  maieul: is maketitle must take an argument ?
14:24  maieul: because i have "Missing number, treated as zero."
14:25  hiwk: maieul: ,,sample
14:25  fsbot: Paste a sample at http://pastebin.tlhiv.org showing your problem in as little code as possible. Make sure it is a *complete* document, and if possible one that compiles! If your LaTeX aborts with errors, paste them too.
14:25  maieul: hihi
14:25  maieul: in spip, you boot is called  "Edgard"
14:26  hiwk: maieul: have you set \author and \title?
14:26  maieul: hiwk: i try with it
14:26  Diverdude: is it even posible?
14:26  Diverdude: to include tiff in latex
14:27  poco: convert it to png
14:27  maieul: hiwk: http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/mM_Ymnp5
14:27  poco: (it may decrease its size)
14:27  Diverdude: poco, no it has to be tiff
14:28  Diverdude: poco, they only accept tiff
14:28  maieul: and in inclure/entete.tex http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/VwXJn_Ah
14:28  poco: Diverdude, they should accept pdf. convert it to pdf.
14:29  ajikeshi: ps is also possible :D
14:29  maieul: any idea ?
14:30  poco: Diverdude, are you compiling with pdflatex?
14:30  maieul: hiwk: i compile with XeLaTex
14:30  |Zz|: maieul, paste the log also, please
14:30  maieul: oki
14:30  hiwk: maieul: that doesn't compile (lacks your documents), but try 1) setting both title and author, 2) setting \title to something simple
14:31  |Zz|: Diverdude, if you submit a pdf, then if the included image was .png or .tiff doesn't matter, because all what they will have is the .pdf
14:32  |Zz|: in addition, is not possible to include .tiff in latex, without converting it to another format (.eps if you compile with latex, or png/jpg/pdf if you compile in pdflatex)
14:33  maieul: |Zz|:http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/J6lnVs2J 
14:33  |Zz|: some editors accept a pdf, but require also that you provide separately the figures in .tiff. If this is the caseo, provide the figures in .tiff, but use png to include them in the pdf
14:33  maieul: hiwk: \title{Usage}
14:33  maieul: \author{Maeeul}
14:34  maieul: take the same thing
14:34  maieul: a sorry
14:34  maieul: no
14:34  |Zz|: maieul, perhaps the problem is in the includes you make before. Try to remove them
14:34  maieul: |Zz|: oki i will try
14:35  maieul: |Zz|: is because i have \siecle{4}
14:35  maieul: in my title
14:35  maieul: we can't take a personnal function into title ?
14:36  maieul: oki, i undestand
14:36  maieul: it is my functtion \siecle which is not cool
14:37  hiwk: maieul: what does siecle do?

14:38  maieul: i'm starting in latex
14:38  maieul: i dont know a lot the synatx

14:42  maieul: what is the diffrence between def and newcommand ?
14:44  hiwk: maieul: newcommand is more high-level, e.g. it won't silently redefine existing commands 
14:46  maieul: oki
14:46  maieul: so it's better ?
14:48  maieul: oki
14:48  maieul: in understand
14:48  maieul: what was my problem

15:49  regebro: prov: Does it generate a link that is correct?
15:49  prov: regebro: Correct in the sense it is functional but not in the way of doing what I wanted it to.
15:50  regebro: prov: No, correct in the sense of "does it generate a link that consists of the correct sequence of characters"
15:51  prov: regebro: Say what???
15:51  regebro: prov: Ie "http://www.google.com" would be correct. "htpt:/oogle,c" is incorrect.
15:51  prov: regebro: I believe that /href{run:./movie.sh}{click} is correct, yes?
15:53  regebro: prov: That's what you type in. What does that GENERATE. What is the resulting link?
15:53  regebro: And it should reasonably be \href not /href
15:54  prov: regebro: In the actuall document it is \href the previous was just an error on my part.
15:57  prov: regebro: I still do not know what you are getting at.
15:58  prov: This is from evince on right click and copy the link \href{run:./movie.sh}{click}
16:00  prov: regebro: This is the generated link in evince, I used right-click and copy address: \href{run:./movie.sh}{click}
16:01  regebro: prov: That seems wrong.
16:01  prov: regebro: Why is that?
16:01  Moopz: Using \includegraphics, all my pictures look really pixilated when I see them in the pdf. Anyone know why? Viewing it with the dvi file it looks perfect. 
16:01  regebro: Links shouldn't start with \href
16:02  regebro: But maybe thats' some PDF specific command I don't know about.
16:02  prov: I got it from here: http://old.nabble.com/run-a-shell-script-from-a-beamer-generated-pdf-td25217096.html
16:03  regebro: prov: Yes, but in tex \something usually means it's a command, that will do something, I generate some output of some kind.
16:04  regebro: prov: In my evice, internal links can not "copy address" so it seems like it's not an internal link or command.
16:04  regebro: It seems like evince thinks that's a web address.
16:05  regebro: prov: But I could be wrong.
16:06  regebro: prov: But href definitely is a latex command that should generate a URL. And apprently it doesn't in this case.
16:07  prov: regebro: It does work but it opens the terminal without executing the script.
16:07  prov: regebro: That is the part that does not work.
16:08  regebro: Well, \href{run:./movie.sh}{click} shoudl result in a link that is "run:./movie.sh". That's what the link should be.
16:08  regebro: I think you are not telling us the whole truth about what you are typing.
16:08  prov: regebro: I have nothing to hide.
16:09  regebro: prov: Good. So tell us how you generate the link.
16:09  prov: regebro: Let me use pastebin, wait a minute.
16:10  white_r: prov: the guide you linked talks about \href{run:scriptname.sh}{click} but you are typing \href{run:./scriptname.sh}{click} I understand they are probably the same, but have you tried the first?
16:11  prov: white_r: yes.

16:13  prov: regebro: Am I transparent now? :)

16:21  hiwk: eggy_: not sure that will automatically work for @ though, but you should probably use it anyways

16:27  regebro: xelatex generates this: /URI(file:movie.sh)
16:27  regebro: So you may try different combinations of that as well.
16:27  regebro: :x
16:27  regebro: Oups.
16:30  prov: regebro: Well, it has been a good three hours of my time on this with googling, forum reading, and now irc. I am thankful for your help but I admit I am tired of staring at my computer screen. This chat is logged and I will go over it again when I am not so tired of this computer. I thank you regebro for your help, much appreciated.
16:30  regebro: OK, that's all for me, no more time for this. :) See ya.
16:56  Moopz: Using \includegraphics, all my pictures look really pixilated when I see them in the pdf. Viewing it with the dvi file it looks perfect though. Anyone know why?
16:59  ajikeshi: question
16:59  ajikeshi: where are the directories defined in which latex looks for sty?
16:59  ajikeshi: it complains about not finding a sty... but i got the necessary sty files in the correct directories
17:04  knittl: can i define axis options for tikz/pgfplots globally?
17:06  ajikeshi: solved the problem.. no need anymore
17:46  Berticus: when I use \underline, and the underlined text goes beyond the textwidth limit, it doesn't break
17:46  Berticus: how do I get around that?

21:04  plus: I am trying to get a modern version of siunitx installed on debian squeeze, which depends on xpackages and expl3. In attempting to install the latter I am encountering some trouble with l3vers.dtx, which when I run latex on I get this output http://pastebin.com/PT8LTrU3
21:05  plus: Also I am using texlive
22:06  marrrk: hello, can I ask a lyx specific question here?
22:08  Morten_: there are lyx users here as well (afaik) :)
22:09  Morten_: ask away
22:11  marrrk: I am using the german version of lyx to write an english "article". when i use the feature to reference something as "no + page", although i set the language to english it becomes "2 auf der nächsten Seite" instead of "2 on the following page" it worked before, so I don't know what might be the problem
22:12  hiwk: marrrk: \usepackage[language]{varioref}
22:13  marrrk: for language i put in en-uk?
22:19  hiwk: marrrk: I would guess "english", but I'm not sure. try reading the varioref manual
