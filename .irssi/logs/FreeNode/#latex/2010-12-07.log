12:05  djoef: I read that I should use a package for symbols as "degrees" : ° would you recommend that? If so, I see I could use gensymb or textcomp, or would you recommend another ?

12:49  joe_the_treee: i am creating a presentation with beamer. why can't i want to create an arrow, thus i used \usepackage{amssymb}  - but eg \leftleftarrows won't work, what am i doing wrong?
12:49 --- Channel #latex was synced in 157 seconds
12:51  knittl: joe_the_treee: i think you have to put it inside a math environment
12:52  knittl: can i set axis options in tikz/pgfplots globally somehow?
12:52  joe_the_treee: knittl, ok trying..
12:53  knittl: joe_the_treee: so $\leftleftarrows$
12:55  joe_the_treee: knittl: works, ty
12:56  knittl: yw
13:48  xerox1: I am having a question concerning page-numbers and headers. Both informations are missing on exact one page (no new chapter). The other ~100 pages are okay. How could i find the problem?
14:17  ferz: Hi
14:18 --- luist_ is now known as luist
14:20  ferz: in a latex document I need to write numbers but I would like to let tex to calc on them and write results.  Where can I start to read about how to achieve this?
15:00  djoef: how do you explain the terms of your formula in latex ? eg. v = d / t with v = velocity, d = distance, t=time
15:01  djoef: I have an align section with a formula, and would like to explain what the letters mean.
15:02  Morten_: Well, I usually explain the terms after \end{align}
15:02  djoef: I was searching for "legend" but did not find much.. does this have another name ?
15:02  Morten_: not inside the environment
15:02  Morten_: ,,amsmath
15:02  fsbot: amsmath -- one of the the most frequently used LaTeX math packages. Its documentation amsldoc can be found on http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/amsldoc.pdf
15:02  Morten_: Think there is some explanation of what you want in that .pdf
15:03  djoef: Morten_, and do you explain that in a table ?
15:03  djoef: or just in plain text ?
15:04  Morten_: plain text
15:04  djoef: I use amsmath
15:04  djoef: so but then you need to do this "inline" math typesetting ? otherwise the letters are not the same right ?
15:05  Morten_: well yeah, in you case: \end{align} where $v$ is the velocity, $d$ the distance and $t$ is the time.
15:05  Morten_: something like that
15:06  Morten_: The letter will be the same if you use $$ in the plain text
15:06  Morten_: letters*
15:07  djoef: ah great thanks :)
15:07  djoef: (srry was reading the doc)
15:10  Morten_: you're welcome :)
15:11  woodrad: http://www.economist.com/research/economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=L#liquiditytrap
15:11  woodrad: oops
15:13  djoef: is it possible to automatically substitute "on page~\pagref{label}" into "this page" if the table is on the same page ?
15:14 * djoef noob
15:15  Morten_: Do you have to write which page the table is on?
15:16  Morten_: is the table follows naturally in the text, there would be no reason to include the page of the table
15:16  Morten_: is = if
15:17  djoef: true, I was just wondering how far latex could put the table :)
15:17  Morten_: ah ok
15:18  Morten_: In most cases you probably just need the table number
15:19  djoef: k
15:32  Aedolon: I'm using the align*-env because I have a long equation and I need to split it, however I do want an equation number somewhere in the middle. Is there an easier way then using align-env and then use \nonumber on each line?
15:33  Morten_: try \begin{equation} \begin{split} ... \end{split} \end{equation}
15:33  Morten_: ,,amsmath
15:33  fsbot: Morten_: amsmath -- one of the the most frequently used LaTeX math packages. Its documentation amsldoc can be found on http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/amsldoc.pdf
15:33  Morten_: Aedolon
15:34  Aedolon: Okay.
15:34  Morten_: the one I wrote will give you a number in the midle
15:34  Morten_: middle
15:35  Aedolon: Nice, that is what I want.
15:35  Aedolon: Can I also use that inside an align?
15:35  Aedolon: (the split)
15:36  Morten_: no, it only works with equation (as far as I know)
15:36  Morten_: but why do you whant to do it inside align, anyway?
15:36  Morten_: want*
15:37  Aedolon: If I have multiple equations and one takes more than a line to write down.
15:40  Morten_: hmm, okay - can't see where that would be 
15:41  Aedolon: Well, I have an integral equation in a 3-vector, so I write down the components, but one is longer than the rest.
16:27  AstralStorm: hello
16:27  AstralStorm: how would I make a wrapfigure-like environment without any figures or dependencies?
16:27  AstralStorm: KISS is welcome
16:30  |Zz|: hangindent and hangafter tex primitives can be useful
16:31  |Zz|: see for example http://books.google.es/books?id=rstheMEAf2gC&lpg=PA107&ots=TS-AXpcUjv&dq=tex%20parshape&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false
16:39  AstralStorm: actually, I just need a box placed at a right place
16:39  AstralStorm: not taking a whole width of a line by itself
16:39  AstralStorm: there's enough space already there, no need to make any
16:43  |Zz|: So I dont understand your question. Is not a wrapfig-like then? Do you need to absolutely position a box in the page? Or relative to a paragraph?
16:43  |Zz|: I guess a rough sketch could help
16:45  AstralStorm: relative to a paragraph
16:46  AstralStorm: put it on the same line as another paragraph specifically
16:46  AstralStorm: or offset it by some space without adding any extra
16:47  AstralStorm: voffset doesn't work there for some reason
17:32 --- luist_ is now known as luist
17:41  Manny: hello there
17:42  Manny: I'd like to position the "enclosures" (\encl{}) in a scrlttr2 document (i.e., KOMA) on the bottom right margin, on the right side of the \closing ("best regards, ..."). Any ideas? Maybe I can define an absolute position environment, and manually fiddle around?
17:43  Manny: "on the bottom right margin" is wrong
17:43  Manny: NOT on the margin, but on the bottom right of the document, on the RHS of some other text
17:45  |Zz|: textpos package lets you put anything anywhere in the page
18:07  lesshaste: how do you do a big logical and ?
18:07  lesshaste: so a big version of ^ basically
18:08  a-v: \land and \lor
18:14  lesshaste: a-v, it comes out small
18:14  lesshaste: an example
18:14  lesshaste:  d(i)=\land_{j=0}^{m-1}\Delta(P[j],T[i+j])
18:15  a-v: Ouch…
18:16  a-v: \bigvee and \bigwedge
18:16  lesshaste: ah yes.. thanks
18:17  lesshaste: I feel latex should have worked that out for me :)
18:17  lesshaste: like a bracket
18:42  a-v: lesshaste, feel free to write and contribute your fixes
19:35  dark: how to insert the multiplicative x? (like in: 2 x 3 = 5) with some \command
19:37  dark: \dotsm seems to be the multiplicative dot
19:37  dark: oh, \times
19:41  dark: do i need to put \times between $ $, like $\times$? (why? mathematical formulas belong to $ $?)
19:42  fow: dark, $...$ marks a math mode section, and \times is a math mode command
19:44  dark: is the concept of math mode somehow hard-coded in tex? or other modes can have specific syntax delimitators? (the $..$ syntax seems somewhat noble/special)
19:44  dark: maybe another mode could be marked with $! .. !$, or something like that?
19:44  fow: There is normal/text mode, inline math mode, and display math mode
19:45  dark: I was using another mode, but it was marked with \something .. \something
19:46  fow: The difference between inline math mode and display math mode is almost entirely in presentation
19:46  fow: \[ \]?
19:46  fow: you would do well to get some primer on LaTeX :P
19:46  fow: The TeX FAQ in the /topic should list some good resources
19:46  hiwk: ,,lshort,, is a good primer 
19:46  fsbot: created.
19:46  hiwk: fuck
19:46  hiwk: ,,lshort
19:46  fsbot: lshort is a (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX at http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/
19:47  hiwk: ,,lshort,,
19:47  fsbot: From memory, lshort,, is a good primer
19:47  dark: I got, but it doesn't talk about math mode :P i'm with the latex tutorial - a primer
19:47  fow: haha :P
19:47  dark: (or maybe it talks in a later section?)
19:47  hiwk: does somebaody know how to get fsbot to forget stuff?
19:47  dark: (from the indian tex users group)
19:48  fow: ,forget ,,lshort,,
19:48  fsbot: whoops,  No such term ,,lshort,,
19:48  fow: mm that was my only guess :/
19:48  dark: the mode I was using rendered theorems in natural deduction style
19:48  dark: ,forget lshort,,
19:48  fsbot: Forgot "lshort,," which had exactly one entry.
19:48  dark: ,,lshort,,
19:48  fsbot: [google]    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/
19:48  fsbot: http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/
19:49  fow: nice
19:49  hiwk: thanks :)

22:18  rschnck: Hey. I'm new to latex and am trying to insert images. However, often when I do this the images somehow move to the bottom of the page, or even to the next page and appear below text that comes after it in my code
22:18  rschnck: I'm using \begin{figure}[h] to insert the images.
22:19  ajikeshi: they move automatically to a place where they fit best
22:19  ajikeshi: but i think you can do something about that
22:19  rschnck: Is there a way to "force" them to stay in place?
22:19  ajikeshi: i think it was something with float in it
22:20  ajikeshi: then it forces the picture to stay at the place.. but its not sure if the picture is set at all... because when it doesnt fit anywhere the compiler just gives up on it
22:21  rschnck: I googled around and found some stuff
22:21  rschnck: Thanks!
22:54  kakazza: Hi, I recently started using LaTeX and have a question.
22:54  kakazza: I am using parskip to have a small vertical space between paragraphs.
22:54  kakazza: But it seems that does not work in tabbing mode.
22:55  kakazza: Is there a way to re-enable that in tabbing mode?

22:55  kakazza: Does work: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/f9BaYMkXXAUt0KYNQabk/
