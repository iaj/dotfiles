08:37  Durandal21: MTecknology: actually, the only change I made to the .cls was to add this at line 187 http://dpaste.com/281401/
08:38  Durandal21: MTecknology: then I removed all of the formatting commands in your \section{} commands in the .tex file.
08:39  Durandal21: I can still make a diff if you want, but since the only change was an addition
08:40  MTecknology: Durandal21: :D Thanks!
08:41  MTecknology: Durandal21: pretty
08:41  MTecknology: Durandal21: so as far as a resume goes - what do you think of how it looks?
08:43  MTecknology: Durandal21: ok- since you're amazing... last question.....
08:44  MTecknology: Durandal21: is it possible to not output the .log?
08:44  Durandal21: I'm not positive. That should be a setting of your compiler.
08:46  MTecknology: Durandal21: not seeing it, I'll assume that I have to just deal with that file myself then
08:47  MTecknology: Durandal21: simple enough - thanks :D
08:47  Durandal21: I don't see a way with Miktex, at any rate.
08:49  MTecknology: Durandal21: You and papna_ have helped me an unimaginable about - Thank you sooo much
08:49  Durandal21: as for how it looks, not bad. Should the \section output be in the margin? On my render it isn't.
08:49  Durandal21: Absolutely
08:50  MTecknology: Durandal21: It should just be to the left - lemme upload a screenshot
08:50  Durandal21: Personally, I would take out the bottom line around your address.
08:50  Durandal21: but that's more a matter of taste
08:51  Durandal21: I would, however, space your address, phone, and email out further. As they are, they sort of run together.
08:51  MTecknology: Durandal21: http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4579/screenshot1qp.png
08:52  MTecknology: Is there any easy way to space them out?
08:52  MTecknology: oh... there's extra spacing above the lists
08:52  Durandal21: hmmm
08:53  MTecknology: hm... I wonder if that was always there or if I'm jsut noticing it now
08:53  Durandal21: Two ways, depending on exactly how you want them spaced.
08:54  Durandal21: that spacing is in my render, too, so I think it's been there.
08:54  Durandal21: as for spreading out the contact line...
08:55  Durandal21: if you want to push the first and last items to the outsides of the page, take out the \hfil around them, and put them in place of the dashes to visually separate the 3 items.
08:55  MTecknology: hrm.. there's extra margin on the right side no that i look at it from futher away
08:56  Durandal21: If, instead, you want to keep them centered, but spread them out a little bit, put a \qquad on each side of the hypen
08:56  Durandal21: also, you should use an emdash (---) rather than a hyphen
08:57  MTecknology: I was actually considering \bullet
08:57  Durandal21: yeah, you do have a wider margin on the right than the left. Hrmmm.
08:57  Durandal21: a bullet would work
08:58  Durandal21: but if you use a dash, it should be an emdash. I know from experience there are people who notice that sort of thing (my boss, for example).
08:58  MTecknology: I'll use the emdash
08:59  MTecknology: --- instead of - also fills out the space some
08:59  Durandal21: as for the extra spacing between headings and lists, try playing with your \sectionskip lengths. I believe I saw them defined in the .cls file
08:59  Durandal21: indeed
09:02  Durandal21: MTecknology: are you intending this to be printed on standard letter paper?
09:02  MTecknology: Durandal21: probably
09:03  MTecknology: Durandal21: I didn't mean between headings and lists, I mean \begin{itemize}
09:04  Durandal21: like between "Ubuntu Linux" and the first bullet, right?
09:04  Durandal21: the rather large amount of vspace?
09:05  MTecknology: ya
09:09  Durandal21: ugh, I used to know the length that needed changed off the top of my head...
09:09  Durandal21: I probably have it set in my own resume, let me take a look.
09:10  MortenTemp: Hi, how do I get the same margin on both sides of the paper, when using the twoside options in the report class?
09:11 --- MortenTemp is now known as Morten_
09:11  Durandal21: Morten_: why are you using twoside if you want the same margins?
09:11  Morten_: Durandal21, to get my chapters to start on the right side
09:11  poco: also to get page numbers correct and footers/headers
09:12  Morten_: yeah
09:12  poco: Morten_, you can always use geometry and specify the margins yourself
09:12  Durandal21: Fair enough, I suppose.
09:12  Durandal21: Morten_: \usepackage[margins=1in]{geometry}
09:13  Morten_: ahh, doh - of course. Thanks to you both
09:13  Morten_: I only had top and bottom in the geometry options
09:18  Morten_: And now my thesis looks great! \o/ Thanks! :D
09:18  Durandal21: Morten_: You can either set them individually, or it will accept all of them being equal (as in my example). Whichever works best for your document
09:18  |Zz|: Morten_, but if you print two-sided, you want to have different margins
09:18  Morten_: Durandal21, I might change them later to have a bit different odd/even margins, but at the moment equal margins are good.
09:18  Morten_: |Zz|, yeah, I have to make a test of that
09:18  Morten_: to see how much I need 
09:18  |Zz|: outer margins need to be wider so that when you hold the book open, the thumbs do not occlude the text
09:18  Durandal21: right
09:18  Morten_: |Zz|, ahh ok. Sounds reasonable :)
09:18  Durandal21: but if this is only going to be left loose, or bound just on the very edge, Morten doesn't need as much asymmetry as twoside gives.
09:18  poco: and inner margins have to be wider because of the curvature due to the bookbinding :D
09:18  |Zz|: Durandal21, right
09:18  MTecknology: Durandal21: I just looed throguh the class for margins and couldn't find anything that stood out
09:19  Durandal21: MTecknology: for the moment, you could try forcing margins with the geometry class, as we just discussed for Morten. It would at least make it look right, even if it isn't the most elegant solution.
09:20  MTecknology: Durandal21: just toss that line below the \documentclass line?
09:21  Durandal21: what line was there? I may have deleted it
09:22  MTecknology: \usepackage[margins=1in]{geometry}
09:22  Durandal21: also, if you are wanting to use the same \itemsep for every list, you should redefine the default by using \setlength{\itemsep}{-2pt}
09:23  Durandal21: MTecknology: ah, yes. That should force all 1 inch margins. For individual control (if it still doesn't look right), use top, bottom, left, and right
09:23  MTecknology: Durandal21: adding that broke the compile
09:24  Durandal21: whoops. Did it throw an error at you?
09:24  MTecknology: yup
09:24  MTecknology: ! Package keyval Error: No value specified for margin.
09:25  Durandal21: did you just add the one line with [margin=1in] ?
09:25  Durandal21: (I can't recall if it is margin or margins for that usage, to be honest)
09:26  MTecknology: ya, that's all I added
09:26  Durandal21: odd. a conflict with the .cls file, perhaps?
09:26  MTecknology: margin and margins do the same thing
09:27  MTecknology: http://dpaste.com/281415/
09:27  Durandal21: also, I just realized that putting the color setting for the \section command into the class file isn't working, is it?
09:27  MTecknology: it is
09:28  Durandal21: hmm, it isn't for me. How odd, haha.
09:28  MTecknology: oh...
09:28  MTecknology: it's nopt
09:28  MTecknology: not*
09:29  Durandal21: also, setting the parskip to something negative fixed the extra space before the lists, though it will also remove the space after the lists. You can add that manually with a \vskip, but I dunno
09:30  Durandal21: Hmm. Well that block of code did work when it was in the preamble of the .tex file. I'll admit I'm still getting used to the nuances of modifying class files.
09:32  MTecknology: coulda fooled me :P
09:33  Durandal21: I've had to play with some package files to get them to do what I wanted, so I'm not completely lost. But they are certainly different beasts that the document files.
09:33  MTecknology: I am completely lost when I look at them
09:34  Durandal21: heh, I had to play with some mathmode blocking. It was a mess, but I learned quite a bit.
09:36  Durandal21: I added \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} to my preamble (immediately after \documentclass) and it compiled just fine.
09:36  Durandal21: It broke the render, but it compiled without errors, ha!
09:36  MTecknology: :(
09:38  Durandal21: ah ha, now I got the error you did
09:38  Durandal21: I wasn't passing the "margin" option to the class.
09:39  MTecknology: Durandal21: just as long as you know you're way above my head I'll sit here and smmile :P
09:40  MTecknology: I'm really starting to see both the power and simplicity behind latex though
09:40  Durandal21: haha, hey, with this resume you should at least know what passing options means ;)
09:42  MTecknology: I get some of it
09:42  MTecknology: it's also 3am :P
09:42  Durandal21: Yeah, resumes are finicky beasts in LaTeX compared to many documents. They need much more attention to ever individual measurement, so you can't sit back and let LaTeX do its thing as much as you would in, say, a report.
09:42  Durandal21: haha, fair.
09:43  MTecknology: interesting... so it should definitely be controlled by the class and not the package
09:44  Durandal21: that's one argument.
09:44  MTecknology: I meant because it's already half way doing that
09:44  Durandal21: My own resume takes the opposite approach, and puts everything in the preamble, using a default class
09:44  MTecknology: I bet a width was changed in teh left side at some point
09:45  MTecknology: Durandal21: any pdf easily available?
09:45  Durandal21: pdf of? my resume?
09:45  MTecknology: ya
09:45  MTecknology: I've been looking at a lot and gained curiousity
09:46  MTecknology: I'm guessing if I actually looked at the source my mind would blow up
09:46  Durandal21: should be uploaded still, let me track down the link.
09:46  Durandal21: haha, I don't know about that... it's not as bad as most class files.
09:47  Durandal21: Class files tend to use more raw TeX commands and more obscure LaTeX macros, so they are harder to read for the casual user.
09:48  MTecknology: Durandal21: btw- the reason I'm trying to bump this over to LaTeX is because I got very pissed off with trying to format things. Not that I couldn't make the format come out the way I wanted. I could eventually make it look exactly right. A hell of a lot quicker too. The pain came in when I wanted to modify it. Oooh did the pain come in.
09:49  Durandal21: yeah, I understand completely
09:49  MTecknology: after a few back and forths of getting frustrated with each again and again - I still wind up preferring the latex
09:51  MTecknology: You know why the color part isn't working?
09:55  Durandal21: MTecknology: My guess is that I didn't use the right command for including a package in a class. But I'm not entirely sure what the right command is.
09:56  Durandal21: MTecknology: did you get my pm?
09:56  MTecknology: Durandal21: I added it to the .tex file
09:56  MTecknology: no, I didn't
09:57  MTecknology: Durandal21: try again
10:03  Durandal21: That's right, I was trying to track down just where the margins are set in that .cls file...
10:05  MTecknology: Durandal21: I think is has to do with the width of the left column (titles)
10:05  Durandal21: perhaps
10:06  MTecknology: only because I remember playing with that somewehre in there at some point
10:06  Durandal21: ah
10:10  MTecknology: Durandal21: nah- still clueless
10:15  Durandal21: wow, the end of that class gets kind of ugly...
10:15  Durandal21: several lengths are set more than once, with different units
10:16  Durandal21: and there's a block of code that looks pasted in from someone who was using A4 instead of letter paper.
10:17  Durandal21: ah, that's where the \mysidestyle is defined. Good to know.
10:23  djoef: Hi, I'm new to latex and have a problem with aligning text to the right (see red marks) and with vertical spacing (see blue marks). Output : http://imagebin.org/125415 Source : http://pastebin.com/YvPpAarU
10:23  kahen_desktop: you're doing it wrong. you should \renewcommand \maketitle
10:24  djoef: kahen_desktop, I did see something like that, but then again, I need to specify it there right ?
10:25  kahen_desktop: http://zoonek.free.fr/LaTeX/LaTeX_samples_title/0.html <-- here are some samples
10:25  djoef: heh right on that page :)
10:26  Durandal21: djoef: also, if you add a % to the end of line 17, I believe it may fix the space after the email address.
10:26  MTecknology: Durandal21: I need to pass out - it's getting way too late for me.
10:27  MTecknology: Durandal21: it's getting late for you too - unless ctcp is wrong - you're int he same tz as me :P
10:27  djoef: Durandal21, indeed thank you :)
10:28  Durandal21: MTecknology: yeah, I'm reaching that point myself. Best of luck.
10:28  Durandal21: haha, yeah, I'm on the extreme other side of it, but same zone.
10:28  MTecknology: Durandal21: thanks, I might bug you more tomorrow
10:28  MTecknology: g'night and thanks again :)
10:28  Durandal21: indeed
10:28  kahen_desktop: if your titlepage is on its own page, then i'd just use \vskip to manually fine tune the appearance
10:29  kahen_desktop: well... actually even if it isn't, i'd still just do it manually
10:30  Durandal21: djoef: vskip can be negative, as well, if you need to shrink space.
10:30  Durandal21: MTecknology: actually, a little manual vskip adjustment might help you in your resume, too.
10:37  kahen_desktop: mmm! needspace.sty is pretty smart
10:37  Durandal21: oh? I haven't played with it.
10:38  kahen_desktop: great for forcing short theorem statements (1-2 lines) to be on the same page as their proof
10:40  Durandal21: hmm, nice
10:40  kahen_desktop: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=nopagebrk
10:40  Durandal21: plays with skips and nice levels, I assume?
10:40  kahen_desktop: probably
10:41  finnomenon: is there a way to have the \begin{align}  block be left aligned?
10:42  finnomenon: instead of in the centre of the page
10:43  Durandal21: finnomenon: have you tried putting it inside a flushleft environment?
10:45  finnomenon: that puts it where I want it, but then I will have to use $..$
10:45  finnomenon: many of them
10:45  finnomenon: it works though, thanks
10:46  Durandal21: finnomenon: I'm sure there's a more elegant way, but I can't think what offhand.
10:46  finnomenon: no proble, thanks
10:46  finnomenon: also,  are you sometimes on EFnet als Durandal?
10:46  Durandal21: nope
10:46  finnomenon: ok
10:47  Durandal21: haven't been on IRC at all for a couple years. Just came back, heh.
10:48  finnomenon: welcome back :)
10:50  Durandal21: thanks
10:56  djoef: kahen_desktop, is this more in the direction of whay you would do ? http://pastebin.com/6NGyg3pD
10:58  Durandal21: djoef: to use \@title without an error, put \makeatletter before that block of code, and put \makeatother after it.
11:07  djoef: Durandal21, thanks.. the output looks great :) still one problem, the title and subtitle gets the values given before maketitle, but the author, email and creationDate are mentioned with @author etc. any clue ?
11:07  djoef: http://pastebin.com/BgDxth5R
11:07  Ricky`: hi guys :) i now that probably what i'm asking is written in any subsubsubsection of the documentation but i'm really in trouble. I'm using listings package and i want that if it possibile that mu lists are not divided across pages. is there a way? :\
11:08  kahen_desktop: you really shouldn't redefine \title and \author
11:09  djoef: kahen_desktop, you're right, I commented those lines out, but still, the problem persists.. any idea ?
11:09  Durandal21: Ricky`: you can include them in a samepage environment, or just include them in a \parbox or \minipage
11:10  djoef: kahen_desktop, so this is the source now : http://pastebin.com/5ZZfyvSg
11:11  Ricky`: Durandal21: samepage seems not working, i try \pabox :)
11:12  djoef: kahen_desktop, and this the output : http://imagebin.org/125419
11:13  kahen_desktop: djoef: try replacing "@author" in \maketitle with "\@author"?
11:14  eXcuvator: hey guys
11:14  djoef: kahen_desktop,  heh, sorry 
11:14  eXcuvator: is there some cool package to have a text *beside* an equation or eqnarray?
11:14  eXcuvator: more than label
11:14  kahen_desktop: ,,eqnarray
11:14  fsbot: eqnarray is, like, Don't use eqnarray! See http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=eqnarray and http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf
11:15  eXcuvator: whatever :P
11:15  eXcuvator: The user is far better served by the AMSLaTeX bundl
11:16  eXcuvator: is that package amslatex? Oo
11:16  djoef: kahen_desktop, works perfect, Can I now save this way of making titles in an external file, and just plug it in when I need it ? eg myTitles.tex and include myTitles.tex ?
11:16  kahen_desktop: i'd make a .sty file and put it in my local texmf, but yes. \input{mytitles} is perfectly fine too
11:17  Durandal21: eXcuvator: you could check out the IEEEeqnarray that is included in the IEEEtrantools package. Has better spacing than the built in eqnarray and includes cell types for plain text.
11:17  djoef: kahen_desktop,  ill read about .sty, guess that means styles :) thanks again.
11:17  snapy: hello, I am fighting against latex2html and (slightly) hevea
11:17  snapy: I would like to find a way to have a URL link work for both PDF and HTML.
11:18  snapy: Meaning that in the PDF the link can be clickable
11:18  snapy: \href does not work with latex2html.  For some reason it does not recognise it as a command
11:19  snapy: and \htmladdnormallink does not create a clickable link in PDF
11:19  snapy: \url creates a link in both, but you cannot give a different text and link as with \href
11:19  eXcuvator: madsen is saying
11:19  eXcuvator: one should simply use aling*
11:20  eXcuvator: align*
11:20  snapy: any help would be welcome :)
11:20  snapy: (and sorry to come in the middle of a discussion :) )
11:23  Durandal21: snapy: you can use the ifthenelse package to put the links inside if/then statements that check what compiler/converter is being used, and render accordingly.
11:23  snapy: uhhmm interesting Durandal21.  I guess this could be automatic in a .sty file, right?
11:24  snapy: so I would create a \myhref command, which would yield an \href for PDF and \htmladdnormallink for HTML
11:24  eXcuvator: so
11:24  Durandal21: I assume so, but I'm not positive. I've seen it used image embedding.
11:24  eXcuvator: back to the original question
11:25  Durandal21: snapy: that's right
11:25  eXcuvator: is there some easy way to *comment* lines of equation of \begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl} or whatever?
11:25  snapy: ok, so which is the condition that separates both (if you know by heart, I am going to check latex2html manual meanwhile)
11:26  snapy: I see \begin{latexonly} and \begin{htmlonly}
11:28  kahen_desktop: you could probably cook something up with ,,cs ifpdf
11:28  fsbot: [google]    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/ifpdf.html
11:28  fsbot: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
11:29  Durandal21: snapy: I don't know for sure. Sounds like you could put one, then the other, and it would act as a conditional statement for you.
11:29  poco: how do i disable justification? i tried \raggedright and \RaggedRight, but still got hyphens
11:29  snapy: ok, Durandal21 trying...
11:29  poco: (penality_
11:30  Durandal21: wow, where did the last hour go...
11:30  Durandal21: okay, I am declaring 4:30am my bedtime for tonight.
11:32  kahen_desktop: poco: babel's doc says there's an environment called 'hyphenrules' which can be given the option 'nohyphenation'
11:33  poco: kahen_desktop, nice, thanks
11:33  snapy: thanks Durandal21 , good night :)
11:36  eXcuvator: is there some way to have automatically some additional spacing before and after arrows?
11:36  eXcuvator: in math mode
11:40  poco: how do i change \emph to be italic/normal even in sffamily 
11:45  kahen_desktop: !l \let\emphold\emph \renewcommand{\emph}[1]{\textrm{\emphold{#1}}} Put some \emph{emphasis} on it!
11:45  kahen_desktop: hmm... no texbot
11:47  kahen_desktop: poco: http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/cubFSeFV
12:10  Diverdude: Does eps support anything else than vector graphics?
12:20  henux: what is the best way of including pieces of source code into latex documents?
12:20  Diverdude: Does .EPS support raster graphics?
12:23  kahen_desktop: henux: ,,listings
12:23  fsbot: hmm, listings is a package to typeset source code: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/
12:23  kahen_desktop: Diverdude: if you need raster graphics in your document, you probably want to use pdftex since it can use .png and .jpeg
12:24  henux: thanks
12:40 --- jdiaz is now known as |Zz|
12:42  poco: thanks kahen_desktop 
12:51  snapy: hello again, I am still unable to find or build an \href equivalent for latex2html
12:52  snapy: I am still looking for a solution to output a CLICKABLE pdf link in (pdf)latex mode and an HTML link in html mode
13:14  Morten_: Hello, if I have an equation that is a bit to wide and therefore courses a badbox, how do I keep the equation as it is, but without the badbox warning?
13:15  snapy: is there an IRC channel for latex2html
13:15  snapy: ?
13:34 --- toe_ is now known as toe
14:00  mickep: snapy: I do not think so. I think this is _the_ tex/latex/friends channel.
14:11  |Zz|: Morten_, do you want to suppress only the warning?
14:37  Morten_: |Zz|, well yeah, that would be enough.
14:38  Morten_: Because it looks alright to me.

16:15  TheOm3ga: hi there
16:15  TheOm3ga: I've changed parskip length to increase the gap between paragraphs
16:15  TheOm3ga: the problem is that it adds a lot of space after section (and subsections, etc) headings
16:15  TheOm3ga: what can I do to remove the parskip after each heading?
16:48  gebjgd: how can i split the "frame" in Beamer into 2 areas, left for the explanation , right for the picture?
16:48  |Zz|: TheOm3ga, better give parskip some flexibility
16:48  |Zz|: gebjgd, use two columns, or two minipages side-to-side
16:48  gebjgd: |Zz|: got you, thx
16:49  |Zz|: TheOm3ga like in \parskip=5mm plus 1mm minus 1mm
16:49  TheOm3ga: |Zz|, thanks, I didn't know you could something like that
16:51  TheOm3ga: that line means that the default skip is 5mm, but in some cases it can be up to 6mm or down to 4mm, isn't it?
16:51  |Zz|: that is
16:54  |Zz|: latex inserts this kind of flexible vertical space at some points, eg. after section headings, around displayed equations, etc
16:54  |Zz|: if your parskip is "fixed", then those other places have to "expand" to provide the required space, so that each page bottom is aligned
16:54  |Zz|: if you make your parskip flexible, you diminish the chances of those other places being too stretched
17:13  TheOm3ga: do you know the name of the symbol that is like \bowtie but with one of the sides open?
17:14  mikael: ,,detexify
17:14  fsbot: symbols is [0] http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/ for a list of symbols
17:14  fsbot: [1] http://detexify.kirelabs.org/ to draw an example symbol online and find results on that
17:29  poco: any idea why using \chapter* keeps the name of the previous non-starred \chapter in the header/footer?
17:31  a-v: Use \markboth, \markleft or \markright after \chapter*
17:40  Diverdude: in which order do i have to compile latex before i can be sure that all bib items and cites in the document are updated correctly?
17:40  HT: LaTeX; BibTeX; LaTex ?
17:42  cryptic0: latex once, bibtex once, latex twice
17:44  Diverdude: cryptic0, ahhh yes ok latex twice...that was what i was missing...how extremely confusing
17:44  cryptic0: can you try with pdflatex(1), bibtex(1), pdflatex(2). I always use pdflatex, but not sure if it will work with bibtex
17:46  bdesk: Diverdude: rubber --pdf mytexdoc
17:46  HT: Twice through tex last? I never do and the output looks fine
17:46  HT: What for is that last pass?
17:47  bdesk: https://launchpad.net/rubber
17:48  bdesk: TheOm3ga: \ltimes
17:48  bdesk: or \rtimes
17:48  TheOm3ga: bdesk, thanks, I eventually got to ltimes :)
17:53  litb: hello all
17:53  litb: in my document, i used \bfseries{...}, but it suddenly makes all text that follows bold, not only the braced text
17:54  litb: if i instead use \textbf{...} it works correctly
17:54  litb: what could be the cause of that?
17:56  HT: {\\bfseries X} == \\textbf{X}
17:57  HT: \bfseries modifies font in current scope (does not take an argument)
17:57  HT: Whereas \textbf{ BOLD } modifies font only in between the {  and }
18:03  litb: oh i had no clue
18:03  litb: i thought \textbf would overwrite the currently selected font with the bold normalfont version, while \bfseries would keep the currently selected font, but just activate bold-ness
18:03  litb: what noob i am :)
18:07  a-v: ,lshort
18:07  fsbot: a-v: I heard lshort is a (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX at http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/
18:08  litb: i read that \textbf is deprecated :/
18:11  litb: hmm, doesn't the KOMA class scrartcl support twoside style?
18:11  litb: i'm using that class for my bachelor thesis and wondering why it doesn't have different borders on consequitive physical pages
18:12  a-v: \textbf is not deprecated. You may have read about \bf
18:13  litb: ohh
18:13  cryptic0: I just use \bf always
18:13  cryptic0: {\bf I am bold}
18:13  cryptic0: why type more when you can type less
18:13  litb: becuase it's deprecated :/
18:13  a-v: because some day it will break and you will spent more time retyping
18:13  a-v: *d
18:22  sum: is there an easy way to get latex put fractions like in a/b instead of !l \frac{a}{b} ?
18:23  a-v: Do you mean "typeset them as a / b"?
18:25  sum: yes
18:25  sum: with a slash instead of a horizontal line
18:25  a-v: I'd say "a/b" works fine.
18:28  a-v: For the "½" type fractions you can use ,,cs xfrac

18:29  xf38r4: Hi, I have a question about images in latex.  I have included an image in a pdf, and it looks gorgeous when the document is at 100% but when i display the pdf at 85% or anything other than 100%, it looks kind of horrible and deformed... Some kind of resampling problem I think.  Anyone know how to deal with this?
18:30  a-v: xf38r4, what is the format of the image?
18:30  xf38r4: .jpg
18:31  a-v: It's a "feature" of your PDF viewer, which most likely doesn't want to spend CPU time performing high quality scaling.
18:33  xf38r4: Hm ok. Is there a filetype that would be more friendly, across various viewers?
18:34  a-v: You shouldn't worry about this because the result will be fine when printing.
18:34  a-v: But in general you should prefer scalable/vector graphics to raster graphics, since, well… you can scale them to whatever resolution you want and you won't see any individual pixels.
18:35  a-v: Of course, this does not apply to photographic images and such, but applies to graphs, charts, etc.
18:37  xf38r4: Hm its an image i made in gimp, so i guess that's basically the same as a photograph
18:38  litb: depends...
18:39  xf38r4: The thing is I need it to look good in pdf because this doc is not for printing, its full of hyperlinks and stuff, kind of an interactive thing. 
18:39  xf38r4: the image just containes some large fancy text and one logo, like a company logo.
18:40  xf38r4: white background, nothing fancy
18:42  xf38r4: I guess i can try making an svg.
18:43  litb: yes. make it a pdf and include it as a pdf
18:43  litb: or as ps
18:48  a-v: GIMP works on raster images, you will get the same result :)
18:48  a-v: try Inkscape or another vector graphics program
18:48  xf38r4: Ah interesting, I will try these things.
18:48  xf38r4: Thanks :)
18:49  a-v: you should also know about ,,cs tikz,, , which allows to program vector graphics right inside your .tex source
18:49  fsbot: [google]    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/contrib/tikz-3dplot/

18:50  litb: Inkscape can also import raster graphics. depending on the graphics it may yield good results

18:50  a-v: ^ that

22:08  Malkavian: I want to add to index following word: $A|B$ but the '|' character has a special meaning; how can I escape this meaning? $A\|B$ does not work
22:10  _llll_: ugh, dont do tex by guesswork
22:10  _llll_: what are you typesetting there, Malkavian ?
22:10  kahen_desktop: sounds like a list of symbols
22:11  kahen_desktop: ,,xyproblem
22:11  fsbot: xyproblem is, like, when you want to do X, and you think Y is how, so you ask about Y instead of X. See <http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341> or <http://wooledge.org/mywiki/XyProblem>.
22:11  Malkavian: no, I am typesetting a math text and I want to have $P(A|B)$ in my index
22:11  _llll_: do you mean conditional probability? ior is that P* scalar product of a and b?
22:12  Malkavian: conditional probability, yes

22:16  kahen_desktop: except for small things like "$\sigma$-algebra"
22:16  Malkavian: and this is what reason??
22:16  litb: _llll_: so there are nasty ways to add a tabular manually to the list of tables
22:16  litb: i'v eno clue :)
22:17  kahen_desktop: no. it's because that would be _silly_. if you already know what the symbol is then you know what it's called and can look it up in the index just fine
22:17  Malkavian: kahen_desktop: I do have math books with symbols in index
22:18 --- Channel #latex was synced in 147 seconds
22:18  Malkavian: and in MY document I want to have this symbol in my index, just because I do want to quickly find the associated formula 
22:19 --- afk|eoc is now known as eoc
22:20  Malkavian: so I will insert into my index \sigma^2 and not just  variance
22:21  eoc: Malkavian: what problem do you have
22:22  eoc: besides ranting here
22:22  Malkavian: the question was how can I escape the vartical bar | and not if it is silly or not
22:23  eoc: so you know \mid | and maybe even \shortmid
22:23  eoc: I still don't get the escape stuff.
22:25  Malkavian: is it possible at all to escape characters when indexing a word? like escaping @ or |
22:27  _llll_: "escape" is a poor term
22:27  _llll_: read documentation for makeindex
22:29  eoc: I'm not quite sure how often you have read the ,,xyprob,, now and still fall back on describing what you think is a solution instead of stating your problem.
22:29  fsbot: From memory, xyproblem is when you want to do X, and you think Y is how, so you ask about Y instead of X. See <http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341> or <http://wooledge.org/mywiki/XyProblem>.
22:30  eoc: it probably won't help to tell you again and again from what I got last days, the problem lies somewhere deeper ..
22:33  Malkavian: I asked you two questions: 1) how do I insert into my index the word 'A|B' - the answer is insert $A \mid B$; 2) if it is possible to escape characters with makeindex - the answer was rtfm; thanks for helping
22:37  _llll_: you're welcome, but it appears you didnt read what was said to you
22:39  _llll_: i certainlywould not assume $P(A\mid B)$ would be correctly spaced for example
22:40  _llll_: and if you think you can use tex without reading documentation, well, good luck with that
22:44  Malkavian: sometimes I just love the logic here on this channel
22:45  _llll_: what logic would that be?
22:45  _llll_: you think we know every piece of documentation off by heart to quote to you?
22:46  _llll_: or every single symbol so we can tell you exactly what to type? get real
22:46  Malkavian: I don't have the energy right now to proove the inconsistency of the statement, I don't read tex documentation
22:47  _llll_: if you dont read documentation you will find tex a frustrating xperience
22:47  Malkavian: it then statement, cool
22:47  _llll_: i suggest using some other software instead.  the output will look worse, but will save you having to understand what you are doing
22:47  Malkavian: if then
22:48  Harph: does somebody know how to use a custom font-size for an specific text?
22:49  _llll_: Malkavian: i dont understand what you mean by "if then, cool", i dont understand what non-literal meaning i should have ascribed to "I don't ead tex documentation"
22:49  _llll_: Harph: what are you typesetting?
22:49  _llll_: ie why is the text in a different font?
22:49  Harph: I just want to write something with i.e font-size: 80px 
22:50  _llll_: but *why* do you want 80px?
22:50  _llll_: there is not one way to do things
22:52  _llll_: Harph: "font-size: 80px" looks like css, tex is a very different model.  trying to thnk of tem in the same way is going to cause many problems for you
22:53  Malkavian: Harph: This a new {\fontsize{16}{0}\selectfont size} and this not
22:54  _llll_: is pretty bad advice in many situations
22:54  _llll_: tex is not ms paint
22:59  Harph: I know that that looks like css
23:00  Harph: I'm don't know how to do it... I just want to do something like \fontsize[80px]{this is the text in 80px}
23:00  _llll_: ,,xyprob
23:00  fsbot: hmm, xyproblem is when you want to do X, and you think Y is how, so you ask about Y instead of X. See <http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341> or <http://wooledge.org/mywiki/XyProblem>.
23:00  kahen_desktop: sounds like you're trying to force a square peg into a round hole 
23:00  _llll_: is it a section heading?
23:01  _llll_: is it emphasis? is it something else?
23:01  _llll_: we know you dont know *how* to do it, that's ok.  but think about *why* not *how
23:02  Malkavian: Harph: {\fontsize{80px}{0}\selectfont this is the text in 80px} and this not
23:03  _llll_: is unlikely to be the answer
23:03  Malkavian: yes, this is ugly css style and later he will have problems with that, but this is what he's looking for
23:04  _llll_: how do you know what he's looking for?
23:04  Malkavian: because he asked for it?
23:04  _llll_: no, his question was ambiguous, no-one can tell what he's asking for
23:04  Malkavian: :-)
23:05  Malkavian: Harph: what dou you want??
23:05  _llll_: btw, you wont get 80px with that anyway
23:05  Malkavian: don't use the \fontsize command, it's evil and ugly; perhaps you are looking for something else
23:05  Harph: look http://pastebin.com/6VYXjFV6 there is the source
23:06  _llll_: are you typesetting a poster?
23:06  _llll_: a presentation?
23:06  Malkavian: _llll_: whel, I do and a overfull hbox as well
23:06  _llll_: there are different solution for both of those
23:07  _llll_: Malkavian: are you sure? cmr isnt available in many sizes
23:07  Malkavian: :-) yes I know, but charter is
23:08  Malkavian: Harph: btw, your code tells me you are actually looking for something else 
23:08  _llll_: quel surprise
23:08  Malkavian: :-)
23:09  Harph: yes
23:09  _llll_: there are some other errors in that code
23:09  _llll_: or at least, other things it would be better not to do
23:09  Harph: I'm creating a cool page for and essay

23:31  djoef: Hi, are there guidelines (or a tutorial) on how to structure bigger documents ? (eg 7 parts, 30 sections) I mean on how to work with external files, and how to use folders etc..
23:35  _llll_: djoef: there are a few packages that let you do things like compile only certian sections at once.  but you can just \input any file you want
23:36  djoef: _llll_, I am using this \input now but the question is more, "is there a standard way to do that" eg, per section, create a directory and name your file that way, use external files per subsection if they are to big etc..
23:36  djoef: (maybe there are problems if you do it in a certain way etc.)
23:45  _llll_: djoef: im not aware of any common practice.  separating the preamble into a single file can help though, one per section is reasonable too
23:46  djoef: k
23:49  djoef: is there a good "todo" package ? or is  "\todo" the one to use ? If so, how can I upgrade it, as I have some troubles in making it work (! Bad space factor (0). error that would be solved by using the latest version) Then again :) how to check the version of a package? And while I am at it, I didn't find the way to read the docs for each package, I'm looking for a kind of api, but don't know what to look for in the texmf folder..
23:49  djoef: heh that were a bunch of questions in one phrase :S
23:54  |Zz|: djoef, todonotes, texdoc
23:54  djoef: |Zz| thanks
23:54  djoef: for the docs, found it.
23:54  |Zz|: texdoc is for the docs
23:54  |Zz|: try texdoc <packagename> at command line
23:55  djoef:  |Zz| my goodness, this is great :)
23:56  |Zz|: indeed, but a great unknown
23:57  djoef: While you're here, is there a "search" function ? eg apropos todo :) for latex packages ?
23:57  |Zz|: not as a command, but you can browse the latex catalogue. And perform searches on it
23:58  |Zz|: in particular, the topic version: http://texcatalogue.sarovar.org/bytopic.html
