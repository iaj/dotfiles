00:25  bosie: how can i actually have a column that is padded but has proper alignment of numbers in a table?
00:29  marcellus: bosie: ,,sampl;e
00:29  fsbot: [google]    http://www.sample.com/
00:29  fsbot: http://sampleourrestaurant.com/
00:29  marcellus: bosie: ,,sample
00:29  fsbot: Paste a sample at http://pastebin.tlhiv.org showing your problem in as little code as possible. Make sure it is a *complete* document, and if possible one that compiles! If your LaTeX aborts with errors, paste them too.
00:29  marcellus: nm
00:30  marcellus: ,siunitx
00:30  fsbot: I think siunitx is [0] a package for typesetting documents with units and tables of numbers -- http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/siunitx.html
00:30  fsbot: [1] siunitx is new and might not be in your TeX distribution yet
00:30  bosie: marcellus: it kinda is a general question though ;)
00:30  marcellus: ,booktabs
00:30  fsbot: marcellus, I heard booktabs is [0] a LaTeX package and typesetting guide for producing publication-quality tables -- http://www.ctan.org/get/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf
00:30  fsbot: [1] look how nice booktabs is: http://www.ludd.ltu.se/~mill/latex/
00:30  marcellus: have numbers in my example table
00:30  bosie: indeed you do
00:31  bosie: which makes me wonder whether or not i should actually do 4868,50 instead of 4868,5 when i also have numbers with more than one decimal like 330,22
00:31  pawleeq: hello 
00:32  marcellus: is ,50 really correct if the number you have is ,5 ?
00:32  bosie: marcellus: well
00:32  bosie: marcellus: probably not
00:32  bosie: marcellus: but it wouldn't look as bad
00:33  pawleeq: I have two-column layout and I would like to put my footnotes in the full-width area on the bottom of the page, is that somehow possible? thx
00:33  Durandal21: bosie: general rule is to keep the decimal aligned if possible, but only put as many digits as actually fit the precision you measured.
00:34  marcellus: pawleeq: I would think so, got any other result?
00:34  Durandal21: bosie: converting to scientific notation may give a more uniform appearance, if appropriate for the data you are presenting.
00:35  bosie: Durandal21: i thought about doing that for values over 100k
00:35  pawleeq: marcellus, what result you mean, I have my footnotes on bottom of each column, which does not looke pretty well...
00:35  bosie: Durandal21: but then i would mix scientific notation and non-scientific notation throughout the pdf. i guess i wouldh ave to stick to it at all times
00:35  Durandal21: bosie: if the data are in the same table, you may want to put all of them in the same notation. Gives a more uniform presentation.
00:36  bosie: Durandal21: yes, same within a table, no between tables
00:36  bosie: Durandal21: some tables have numbers > 1M, whereas others have values between 0.001 and 0.0000001
00:36  Durandal21: bosie: mixing notation throughout the document may be appropriate if it fits with the values you have.
00:36  marcellus: I think latex treats the columns as two pages.
00:37  bosie: Durandal21: hmm, alright
00:37  Durandal21: bosie: in both those cases, I would use scientific notation. In the middle, it depends.
00:37  marcellus: I had very disparate numbers in my table too.
00:37  bosie: Durandal21: middle being what? 283 & 384 & 192 ?
00:37  Durandal21: bosie: something to look at is, even if the data is in different decades, do they have the same number of significant digits? If so, scientific notation may give a more uniform appearance.
00:38  bosie: marcellus: you had no scientific notation though
00:38  Durandal21: bosie: in the case of data like that, standard notation may be more approachable, as long as all the data in that table is easily read in that form.
00:38  marcellus: I mean Zeta gram as the weight.
00:38  marcellus: scientific notation?
00:39  bosie: marcellus: true but that has to be the ugliest column i have ever seen to be honest
00:39  bosie: especially since there is no padding ...
00:39  Durandal21: #,### * 10^#
00:39  bosie: Durandal21: will have to dig into that, don't know how similar the significant digits are
00:39  marcellus: could be done with that notation too
00:39  Durandal21: or #,###E## is also a valid form for presentation.
00:40  marcellus: read the siunitx doc
00:40  bosie: why is it that latex docs are that long?
00:40  bosie: i mean... 81 pages? really? ;)
00:40  Durandal21: yeah, scientific notation presents really well when you have a mix of large and small numbers, but they all have similar amounts of significant digits (i.e. relative precision)
00:41  Durandal21: bosie: haha. Good ones are that long because not only do they tell you what it does, they also tell you how it does it, why you should use it, and usually a few use-case examples as well.
00:42  marcellus: If you are going to compare the weight of jupiter and ceres those are the weights you need to put in the table. Mixing the notations would be bad for comparisons.
00:42  BCMM: if you do scientific notation, look at the siunitx package. it makes it a LOT less labour-intensive.
00:42  bosie: marcellus: you wouldn't mix notation, you stick to one
00:42  bosie: BCMM: i am reading it but can't find how to put any paddings in the column
00:43  BCMM: oh, you want them lined up?
00:43  bosie: BCMM: with the .
00:43  BCMM: huh, i can't think of a way to do that other than writing it all out in full and using an aligned environment :(
00:44  Durandal21: bosie: it might be worth looking at using some sort of align environment. Then you could put an alignment marker beside your decimal, and it would always line up correctly.
00:44  BCMM: bosie: google found http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2746/old-question-aligning-numbers-by-decimal-points-in-table-columns
00:44  Durandal21: But I've found mixing tables and align environments can get tricksy.
00:44  BCMM: apparently siunitx adds a column type!
00:45  bosie: Durandal21: but how do you pad a column?
00:45  BCMM: siunitx is fantastic, incidentally
00:45  Durandal21: bosie: IEEE might have some tools to help with this, as well.
00:45  BCMM: bosie: does the first answer on that URL do what you're talking about?
00:45  bosie: Durandal21: i really thought latex has that built in ;)
00:45  Durandal21: bosie: I don't recall, though I feel like I used to know a way.
00:45  bosie: BCMM: yes
00:46  Durandal21: bosie: I've found some of the IEEE tools work far better than some of the built in ones, anyway. I love IEEEeqnarray to death.
00:46  bosie: BCMM: it would align the numbers (same as marcellus has in his pdf) but the padding is tight then
00:46  bosie: Durandal21: since i am a CS student it is no surprise to me that IEEE has some good solutions
00:47  bosie: Durandal21: not sounding too cocky. but IEEE is technology and presenting numbers/formulas is really their base work ;)
00:47  marcellus: I am all for good looking tables, but not at the expense of functionality, which is in this case the ability to compare values easily.
00:47  bosie: marcellus: your table would get tossed out here
00:47  marcellus: how so?
00:47  bosie: marcellus: cell Massa/Jupiter the 1 is hardly readable
00:48  marcellus: 1.8 million Zg?
00:48  bosie: zes
00:48  bosie: yes
00:48  bosie: if i am allowed to critizise you without getting kicked ;)
00:49  marcellus: what is unreadable about that?
00:49  bosie: Tabell 2?
00:49  bosie: the fact the 1 is basically on top of the line
00:49  Durandal21: bosie: oh, it didn't surprise me, either. I'm just pointing out that in my actual use, I have been incredibly happy with their packages.
00:49  marcellus: no, that table is to show how ugly rules are
00:49  bosie: right
00:50  bosie: marcellus: will try your tabell 1 approach and see if it is enough for me
00:50  marcellus: I should probably describe the tables. Just made up the second to show why one should read and use booktabs.
00:50  bosie: though i would still make certain columns wider
00:51  marcellus: to be honest I don't even remember how large Zeta is, but I tried to stay consistent with km and what not.
00:51  bosie: marcellus: to be honest I don't even know what zeta is
00:52  marcellus: Zetta  http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/tek1/prefixes.htm
00:52  Zet: shut up
00:53  bosie: marcellus: no wonder i have never heard about it ;)
00:53  marcellus: was introduced over 15 years ago 
00:54  bosie: i was busy playing soccer at the age of 10
00:54  bosie: kidding
00:56  bosie: marcellus: do you know if one can set the width of a column in booktabs, use the S-table-format you did and have it centered in the middle ?
00:56  bosie: marcellus: all i can find is adding space after a line, not after a column
00:58 --- eoc is now known as eoc|callback
00:59  marcellus: don't understand
01:00  bosie: i want to have a column that aligns at the decimal. I can do that
01:01  bosie: but that column has to have a specific width and the alignment should be in the center/middle of the column
01:04  marcellus: why a specific width?
01:04  bosie: marcellus: so i have room between that column and the next
01:04  marcellus: elaborate
01:05  bosie: marcellus: i have 4 columns, i want whitespace between the first and the second
01:05  bosie: at the moment i either use p{Xin} or i add a fifth column between the first and the second
01:06  bosie: which is tedious on large(r) tables
01:06  marcellus: that is the wrong approach
01:06  bosie: i figured
01:06  marcellus: I would think in a basic tabular you would use @{something} to do that
01:07  bosie: what is @{something} ?
01:07  bosie: does that have a name i could google for?
01:07  marcellus: ,cs array
01:07  fsbot: [google]    http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array
01:07  fsbot: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/array.pdf
01:09  marcellus: I don't see why it is necessary to add column spacing though. I need to see an example of where it is needed.
01:10  bosie: k
01:11  bosie: marcellus:
01:11  bosie: marcellus: http://www.cimaglobal.com/Global/Images/InsightImages/September%202010/table5.gif
01:12  bosie: say you want more space between the first column (def. tax.) and Now
01:12  marcellus: speaking of which if the manual is 81 pages than I need to update my installation..
01:13  marcellus: try @{}
01:13  bosie: marcellus: trying as we speak
01:13  lue: Hi. I'm considering using the memoir class for a novel I'm writing for fun. Does the memoir class provide a command for scene breaks in a novel?
01:15  bosie: marcellus: i like it
01:15  bosie: marcellus: thank you very much
01:15  bosie: same goes to Durandal21 ;)
01:16  marcellus: lue: don't know, but that does sound very specific
01:17  marcellus: I think external packages should be ok as long as something similar isn't implemented in memoir.
01:18  lue: I'm looking through the memoir class' manual to find out if it does.
01:18  marcellus: I know it has some verse stuff.
01:20  marcellus: what is a scene break?
01:21  marcellus: what does it look like
01:21  lue: In some novels, it's a blank space or a few characters (such as ***) that separates different 'scenes' in a chapter.
01:24  marcellus: that is in memoir
01:24  marcellus: \fancybreak I think it is called
01:30  lue: that looks to be it! Thank you.

14:33  fsbot: From memory, booktabs is [0] a LaTeX package and typesetting guide for producing publication-quality tables -- http://www.ctan.org/get/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf
14:33  fsbot: [1] look how nice booktabs is: http://www.ludd.ltu.se/~mill/latex/
14:34  Moopz: Is it off topic to ask about packages?
14:35  Moopz: Specifically, the listings package. 
14:36  |Zz|: ,,ask
14:36  fsbot: I think ask is [0]  Go ahead and ask :-) ... and some one will try to help.. if not right now, whenever they happen to wander over to the computer
14:36  fsbot: [1] don't ask to ask and don't ask if someone has or can. Just ask your question and everybody will be happy ;-)
14:38  Moopz: Alright. Well I'm using Listings to format Java code for it to look nice. In the PDF, there's an example where the author uses horizontal lines, around his listings where the caption is above the top horizontal line. He says it's discussed elsewhere, but I cannot find it in the PDF. 
14:39  Moopz: And simply doing \hline above and below doesn't do much good.
14:40  |Zz|: try \hrulefill instead of \hline
14:41  Moopz: Well I now get both horizontal lines, but the caption is inside the horizontal lines. 
14:42  |Zz|: perhaps option frame=tb ?
14:42  |Zz|: i.e \begin{lstisting}[frame=tb]
14:42  Moopz: <3
14:43  Moopz: Worked.
14:43  Moopz: Thanks alot.
14:43  |Zz|: np
14:43  |Zz|: btw, t means "top", b "bottom"
14:43  |Zz|: so you can figure out other kind of "borders"
14:43  Moopz: Yeah I figured. But I didn't know frame had those parameters. 
14:44  |Zz|: p.34 of listings reference manual
14:45  Moopz: :D I just wasn't looking in the right place then. I was trying to find something to do with horizontal lines and nothing

17:19  bosie: |Zz|: Ctrl-N should do what? read the bibitems/.bib file?
17:19  bosie: |Zz|: here it shows a random list of words, it seems
17:21  |Zz|: perhaps I misremembered the key
17:21 --- Channel #latex was synced in 156 seconds
17:23  bosie: |Zz|: \ref is F9, but it doesn't work for me on \cite
17:23  |Zz|: ah, yes F9. It should work on cite too
17:23  bosie: only works on single-tex files without a bib file
17:23  bosie: so inline bibitems are displayed just fine
17:25  |Zz|: It should work also for single-tex files with a .bib file (as long as the .tex contains a \bibliography{foo} command, so that latex-suite knows that foo.bib is the file to search in)
17:25  bosie: |Zz|: and on multi files?
17:25  |Zz|: for multi-file tex documents, it is neccessary to define somehow the name of the master file, so that latex-suite scans that file in search of a \bibliography command
17:26  bosie: |Zz|: that's done by defining a master file with the name like mainfile.tex.latexmain no?
17:26  bosie: i mean compiling the multi file latex source works
17:29  |Zz|: I really never used <F9> on a multi-file document, but according to the documentation, that should be the way, yes
17:29  |Zz|: or defining the variable latex-master-file
17:30  |Zz|: in each of the sub-files
17:30  bosie: you mean this:
17:30  bosie: %!TEX root = ../main.tex
17:31  bosie: cos that doesn't work for me ;)
17:31  |Zz|: sorry, I cannot help you with that
17:32  |Zz|: I have no experience
17:35  bosie: thanks anyways
17:36  |Zz|: np
17:40  Durandal21: |Zz|: in regards to latex-suite, one shortcut I do find quite useful is <leader>ll to compile and <leader>lv to open the viewer. I find it easier to do that than :! latex (so on and so forth)
17:42  Durandal21: It also then opens the error log window beneath the current buffer (and loads into buffer whatever file the error is actually in, if you're working with multiple files), which is convenient to my workflow as well. I don't have to keep looking back and forth between the shell output and my source.
17:42  bosie: Durandal21: which i personally hate
17:43  Durandal21: bosie: why is that?
17:43  bosie: Durandal21: because i don't care about references not being found etc until i debug the latex file
17:43  bosie: Durandal21: until then i only care about errors
17:43  bosie: and having a quickfix list and the log file popping up is overkill
17:44  bosie: also because it jumps to the error, moving away from the file sometimes even
17:44  glyj: C-C C-C (twice) is not bad with emacs and AucTeX (+ flyspell + asy-mode) ...
17:45  Durandal21: Yeah, I'll admit that while jumping to a different file seems handy, it can be rather awkward to get the buffer you want back into the window, and get your screen back down to one window
17:46  bosie: Durandal21: before i compile i set mark A and jump back to it... great :/
17:46  Durandal21: I really need to get into the habit of using marks, heh
17:46  bosie: best thing ever ;)
17:47  Durandal21: also, I'll admit that the latex-suite folding is not quite what I would prefer
17:47  Durandal21: but it beats the hell out of having to set every fold manually
17:47  bosie: Durandal21: really? i find it great kinda
17:47  bosie: Durandal21: but i only need figures/sections/subsections/tables tbh
17:47  Durandal21: I'm slightly obsessive about many-leveled folding.
17:48  bosie: about what?
17:48  Durandal21: Basically I like any atom that takes more than one line of code to be able to fold.
17:48  bosie: why?
17:49  Durandal21: I dunno. Just appeals to me aesthetically for some reason or another.
17:49  bosie: aha
17:49  Durandal21: Also I used to use it to see several relevant parts of the document at the same time...
17:50  bosie: Durandal21: wish vim and vim-latex would be smarter
17:50  Durandal21: ...but then I discovered loading the same buffer twice on the same terminal screen, which is rather the superior way to see two parts of code at once anyway
17:52  Durandal21: And I was wasting so much time folding every single atom, and having to adjust folds half the time after making an edit, that I just got used to the default folding done by latex-suite instead.
17:52  Durandal21: which has the perk that, if the folds do get fucked up, I can fix them by simply hitting <leader>rf
17:55  bosie: Durandal21: haha yea split windows are great ;)
17:57  Durandal21: split windows are another thing I need to get a bit more proficient with.
17:57  bosie: thought you meant that
17:58  Durandal21: I can set them up, but it usually takes me a little bit to get it how I want.
17:58  Durandal21: Oh, that is what I meant
17:59  Durandal21: but I'd like to be able to use them better than just having an equal split with different buffers in them.
18:00  Durandal21: As it stands, I don't have the commands to change buffers directly memorized, nor the commands to manipulate the windows once they are split.
18:00  |Zz|: I do not use split window. But I do multi-buffer editing
18:00  |Zz|: I mapped tab (in command mode) to :bn command (buffer next)
18:01  Durandal21: big difference between using them and enjoying them, and being completely comfortable with them.
18:01  |Zz|: this way I can have several files loaded in vim, and only one visible at once, and use TAB to switch
18:01  Durandal21: |Zz|: interesting. Why that as opposed to having several tabs?
18:01  Durandal21: and using gt and gT to switch (or mapping <tab> to gt)
18:02  |Zz|: Well, it is easier to change between the edited files this way, at least to me, specially in terminal mode (not GUI mode)
18:02  |Zz|: Hm... 
18:02  |Zz|: I just realized I dont know what a tab is in vim :-)
18:03  |Zz|: how do you create a new tab?
18:03  Durandal21: haha, yeah, they are a fairly recent discovery for me as well
18:03  Durandal21: :tabnew creates an empty tab, and :tabe <file> loads that file into a new tab.
18:04  Durandal21: gt moves forward a tab, gT moves backward a tab
18:04  |Zz|: yes, I'm reading about it in vim help
18:04  |Zz|: looks useful... and mostly equivalent to my "buffers" approach
18:05  Durandal21: Pretty much. With the added benefit that (if you wanted), you could have a tab with a split window and reuse buffers from other tabs
18:06  |Zz|: hm.. apparently a tab can contain several buffers, so I can mix both approaches, and use tabs to group related budders
18:06  |Zz|: buffers
18:08  Durandal21: The way I understood it, tabs can contain several windows but the overall buffer list (what you were cycling between) is persistent across that memory instance of Vim.
18:08  Durandal21: So no matter what tab you were in, if you started cycling through buffers, you would be cycling through all of them.
18:09  bosie: why would one use tabs in vim?
18:09  Durandal21: but as I admitted earlier, I am by no means proficient with buffers, just mildly familiar.
18:10  |Zz|: Durandal21, my preliminary test suggest that buffers pertain to each tab, instead
18:10 --- MJ is now known as Guest10824
18:10  Durandal21: bosie: to have several files open that you don't need to view simultaneously
18:10  |Zz|: anyway.. can I go directly to a tab by its number?
18:10  bosie: Durandal21: wouldn't you just use buffers?
18:10  Durandal21: bosie: or to have several different sets of split window arrangements
18:11  Durandal21: bosie: yes, you could do the first with buffers, but the different split layouts you could not
18:11  Guest10824: hello there! I've a question about the \verb command
18:11  Durandal21: |Zz|: if you're testing it, you're probably right, haha.
18:11  bosie: Durandal21: hmm true
18:11  Durandal21: Guest10824: a little more detail?
18:11  Guest10824: is there a way to break it (automatically) in more than one line? Because it often goes out of the page margins
18:12  bosie: Durandal21: where would you use diff. split layouts?
18:13  bosie: Durandal21: though i can see how that is useful on a small(er) monitor
18:13  Guest10824: becuase is text that should stay inline with other text, but if is long it usually get out of the page margins
18:13  Durandal21: Guest84777: not with \verb. The point of it is that it is completely literal. However, I believe there are other literal environments that still obey margins.
18:14  Guest10824: uhm, do you know some of them?
18:16 --- Nereid` is now known as Nereid
18:16  Durandal21: bosie: on a smaller monitor, or I could see using it if, say, on a longer document I am editing both the .tex file and the .cls, and with each I need to be able to see other parts of that (or another) document
18:17  bosie: Durandal21: k
18:17  Durandal21: wow, what the heck just happened with everyone disconnecting?
18:17  bosie: Durandal21: maybe when i get back into programming
18:17  ajikeshi: Durandal21, a server got disconnected... and it will be in sync again soon
18:18 --- Guest84777 is now known as quaestor
18:18  Durandal21: bosie: yeah, I'm not saying I do use them like that frequently, just that I could foresee use cases.
18:19  bosie: Durandal21: managing buffers and windows is enough work really ;)
18:19  bosie: adding a third layer makes it just cumbersome
18:20  Durandal21: bosie: also, tabs are easier to switch between than buffers be default, ha!
18:20  bosie: but if bufexplore actually supports switching tabs automatically, i could get into it
18:20  Durandal21: quaestor: sorry to leave you hanging. Just a sec
18:20  bosie: Durandal21: yea, but i use command-t and bufexplore
18:22  Durandal21: quaestor: also, why are you needing to use a verbatim environment to begin with, I should probably ask
18:23  icqn: is it possible to use split within split?
18:23  Durandal21: Guest10824: Whoops, I didn't see we had two Guests on the channel; I meant to address you.
18:24  Durandal21: Guest10824: what are you using the verbatim environment for anyway?
18:24 --- eoc` is now known as eoc
18:25  Guest10824: I use it to write programming methods
18:25  Guest10824: I mean, something like "and calling the method \verb! someMethod()! everything works"
18:26  icqn: I write a very long equation like f(x) =& ..... \\ & ....., but the .... does not fit on line :-(
18:26  Guest10824: but sometime the someMethod() part is longer and gets out of page margins
18:26  eoc: what about the listings package?
18:26  icqn: so I wanted to break it and adjust to the right, but do not know how to do so...
18:29  |Zz|: Guest10824, if you are using verb to contain urls or paths, you can use \url command instead (from url package)
18:30  icqn: any hints?
18:30  Guest10824: no, there isn't any url, just long methods
18:30  Guest10824: (java methods, to be more precise)
18:31  |Zz|: hm.. it can be useful too.. \url allows breaks at spaces, at slashes and at _
18:32  Guest10824: uhm, ok, I'll try it, give me some minutes
18:32  |Zz|: also you can simply use \texttt and protect _ with \_
18:33  Guest10824: using \url{} works
18:34  Guest10824: but know they are clickable (I won't print that, but only share the PDF)
18:34  |Zz|: yes.. that is because you use hyperref package too
18:34  Guest10824: let's remove that
18:34  |Zz|: I think that url package defines also \path, which is formatted as url but does not interfere with hyperef
18:35  Guest10824: still clickable
18:35  Guest10824: \url{from.addToQueue((Airplane)(AirplaneImplementation.this), true)}
18:36  Guest10824: how should this be transformed to \textt{}
18:36  Guest10824: I mean, to make it "breakable" in a new line
18:37  |Zz|: hmm.. even if you use texttt, the only allowable breaks will be at spaces, so you should insert some
18:37  |Zz|: for example after the cast
18:37  |Zz|: or after the first (
18:37  Guest10824: there's a space after the coma
18:37  |Zz|: yes, but is the only one
18:37  |Zz|: so tex will not have much choice
18:37  Guest10824: ok
18:38  Guest10824: I'll now try to add some more spaces
18:38  |Zz|: instead of spaces you can also try \allowbreak
18:38  |Zz|: this will produce a line break if appropiate, and no space if no break is inserted
18:39  Guest10824: adding a space after the cast works
18:39  Guest10824: how should I use the \allowbreak?
18:39  |Zz|: so \textt{from.addToQueue(\allowbreak (Airplane)\allowbreak (AirplaneImplementation.this),\allowbreak true)}
18:40  Guest10824: ok
18:40  |Zz|: the difference is that, depending on the rest of the paragraph, if TeX decides not to break after the cast, then you will have a printed space anyway after it
18:40  |Zz|: but using \allowbreak, if the cast and the parameter are not broken, then there will be no space between
18:41  |Zz|: \url basically does this, i.e. insert \allowbreak at strategic places
18:41  Guest10824: yes, I got it
18:41  Guest10824: thank you so much
18:41  Guest10824: it worked! :)
18:41  |Zz|: yw
18:42  Guest10824: cheers! it's time to have dinner! :)
19:19 --- `Fuco` is now known as Fuco
19:42  maieul: hello
19:42  maieul: someone can help me ?
19:42  maieul: it is a question about bibliography
19:48  Durandal21: maieul: What is the question?
19:48  maieul: i have a .bib file
19:49  maieul: i just want to have a listing of all reference in this
19:49  maieul: so i can't use \noref, because it will be long
19:49  maieul: (for information : i have the package biblatex)
19:49  maieul: is my question clear ?
19:50  maieul: (i am french)
19:50  Durandal21: So, you want to force it to show all of the references, instead of just the ones you cited?
19:50  maieul: yes
19:51  maieul: because i must take to my teacher an indicativ bibliographie
19:51  Durandal21: I don't know of anything offhand. Have you read the bibtex documentation?
19:52  maieul: i didn't find
19:53  Durandal21: http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/bibliographies0.html <-- looks like number 10 on this page answers your question, yes?
19:53  Durandal21: basically, it suggests using a wildcard (*) inside the \nocite command
19:53  maieul: Durandal21: i try, but i think it is
19:55  maieul: Durandal21: yes !
19:55  maieul: it's running
19:55  maieul: thank a lot
19:56  Durandal21: maieul: so you know, To find that answer I just typed "bibtex print all references" into Google, and that page was the first result.
19:56  maieul: oki
19:56  maieul: i was thinking it wil be must hard, and i don't think to write in english
19:57  maieul: i'm stupid
19:57  Durandal21: There is quite a bit of information on LaTeX out there. Much of the time, a search engine can find you the answer you want rather quickly.
19:57  Durandal21: Nah, not stupid. That's a fair point.
19:57  Durandal21: There might even be French pages for it, though.
19:57  maieul: some little
19:58  Durandal21: I'm afraid I don't read French, so if our circumstances were reversed, I would be just as lost
19:58  maieul: hihi
20:02  maieul: Durandal21: i'm a SPIP (a french CMS) users and then somebody ask a question that the answer is in google, i'm hungry, that is why i said "i'm stupid"

21:03  jruoho: something probably stupid: how can i insert "normal" text into an environment done in italics?
21:04  cryptic0: jruoho:  try this {\em this text is italic {\em this text is not italic}}
21:04  jruoho: cf. in \begin{theorem} italic text... [then some non italic in-between]
21:04  jruoho: cryptic0: thanks, it worked.
21:04  cryptic0: great.
21:06  |Zz|: jruoho, in fact, the command for "upright text" is \textrm
21:07  |Zz|: \emph does not mean "italics", but "emphasize". This is why it has different effect when used in a upright paragraph than in an italic paragraph
21:08  |Zz|: when the text is already in italics, the way to emphasize it is to "cancel" the italics
21:09  cryptic0: |Zz|:  thanks for that info.
21:09  |Zz|: by the way, {\em foo} syntax is deprecated. \emph{foo} should be used instead
21:16  cryptic0: |Zz|:  i thought it was the other way round

22:14  lue: (When I say unicode, I mean *unicode*. Things like box-drawing characters, playing cards, and the like.)
