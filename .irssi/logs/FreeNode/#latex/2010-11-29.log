17:22  iaj: lo there: )
17:23 --- Channel #latex was synced in 12 seconds
17:29  djoef: Hi, I'm new to latex, I would like to know where I should look for the options of a command. eg documentclass.
17:29  djoef: (I'm looking for a "kind-of" API)
17:31  djoef: Then the second thing I wanted to do, is to make the title spacing smaller. (takes up almost 1/3 of the page..) If you want to achieve such a thing, how do you start ? Where do you look for information ?
17:33  hiwk: djoef: there is a "texdoc" command, but google is usually my go-to guy
17:33  hiwk: djoef: you might enjoy ,,lshort
17:33  fsbot: hmm, lshort is a (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX at http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/
17:34  hiwk: djoef: what do you mean by "title spacing"?
17:34  djoef: hiwk, the verctical space the title takes
17:34  djoef: I love the way it looks, it just takes a lot of space for small documents (eg a week report)
17:35  hiwk: the title \maketitle produces?
17:35  djoef: hiwk, yes
17:35  hiwk: then you might want the \maketitle environment 
17:35  hiwk: blah
17:35  hiwk: *titlepage
17:40  djoef: hiwk, you mean to use a title page ?
17:40  djoef: hiwk, I just want to make the title taking in less vertical space..
17:41  djoef: I found a solution just by making the title yourself, but I suppose \maketitle can have some options, and maybe options to make it take less space..
17:41  djoef: I just cant find what I can do with "maketitle"
17:42  djoef: I'm using http://tug.ctan.org/search.html to search for it, but can't find it
17:42  hiwk: yeah, I meant titlepage. try http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Title_Creation
17:43  yates: does HA-prosper require prosper to also be installed?
17:44  yates: is there a way to install these with yum under f13?
17:47  iaj: lo there.. im on osx and installed tex via tetex - was that the correct choice, or should I rather have chosen texlive port package?
17:48  devurandom: Hello!
17:48  devurandom: Is it possible to do something like \pgfmathsetmacro\x0; \foreach \t in ... { \draw (\x,0) -- +(0,1); \pgfmathsetmacro\x{\x + 1}; } in TikZ/PGF?
17:48  iaj: and the other question I have - is there any common way to obtain needed packages such as {cd-cover} via port ?
17:48  devurandom: (I want to increment a variable x, while iterating over a variable t)
17:51  yates: iaj: tetex is, afaik, a little outdated; generally texlive is the better way to go at this point in time
17:51  devurandom: My problem is that I have x_t implicitly defined as "x_{t-1} + blurb", so I cannot simply set x=...something without x...
17:51  iaj: yates: thanks.. and how can I obtain some furhter packages?
17:52  yates: don't know - i'm a linux user
17:52  devurandom: iaj: I think there is a program called "ctan" (or similar), which is kind of a latex package manager. It should be able to download and install latex packages for your user.
17:53  yates: oh, yeah, there's the ctan site, if you wantt o install manually, sure
17:53  yates: www.ctan.org
17:54  yates: iaj: i thought you meant via the osx package manager 
17:54  iaj: yates: nah, im using the command line as well
17:54  iaj: just uninstalled tetex and installing texlive onw
17:55  iaj: now*...  so I can use CTAN to install latex packages... how would that look like for example?
17:55  yates: it's kinda a pain
17:55  iaj: i didn't wanna hear that ;)
17:55  yates: you have to decide whether you want them to be local or part of the distribution
17:55  yates: if local, decide on a directory
17:56  yates: copy over via the TDS (tex directory structure) guidelines
17:56  yates: then to texhash
17:56  yates: s/to/do/
17:56  yates: that's all... :)
17:56  devurandom: Sorry, the tool is not called "ctan", but "tlmgr".
17:57  devurandom: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1870/installing-new-packages-from-ctan-through-command-line-or-auctex-on-mac-os
17:58  devurandom: -> http://www.tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html and on OSX: http://code.google.com/p/mactlmgr/
17:58  iaj: devurandom: thanks...
17:58  yates: devurandom: what version of TL are you using?
17:59  iaj: yates: the thing with the TDS seems difficult, no?
17:59  devurandom: yates: 2009 as comes with Ubuntu
17:59  yates: yeah, i'm hamstrung with tl2007 in f13
18:00  yates: which apparently doesn't have the tlmgr utility
18:02  devurandom: yates: Ubuntu does neither. But vanilla TexLive has.
18:02  devurandom: (Since 2008)
18:05  devurandom: So, does anyone have an idea, in TikZ, how to iterate over a variable t and calculate a variable x like x_t = x_{t-1}+foo? I tried \pgfmathsetmacro\x0; \foreach \t in ... { \draw (\x,0) -- +(0,1); \pgfmathsetmacro\x{\x + 1}; } but without success (\x is 0 at the start of the loop, as if it would be reset)
18:08  yates: devurandom: i use pstricks
18:09 --- jdiaz is now known as |Zz|
18:10  yates: \pgfmathsetmacro\x0; \foreach \t in ... { \draw (\t,0) -- +(0,1); \pgfmathsetmacro\x{\t + 1}; }
18:10  yates:   
18:10  yates: i think...
18:11  yates: you should use the \t in the body
18:14  devurandom: yates: No I think not. I just need \t to define how many steps I want do do. I need to calculate x based on the last value of x.
18:16  yates: so \x is both a value and a function?
18:28  knittl: can i crop graphics when including with \includegraphics?
18:30  poco: knittl, yes
18:30  poco: use trim
18:31  knittl: poco: perfect, thanks :)
18:32  devurandom: yates: No, x is just a value.
18:32  devurandom: I am now trying to write a macro which recurses \t times and updates \x while doing so. But I cant get it to work: ! You can't use `the character 7' after \advance.
18:34  devurandom: The code is: \def\myrec#1{ \\	\ifnum#1>0 \\		{\advance#1 by -1 \myrec#1} \\ \fi  \\}
18:34  devurandom: (\\ means a linebreak in the actual sourcecode)
18:46  knittl: do i have to wrap i lstlisting inside a figure to make it referencable?
18:48  cfchris6_: Having \sum_{i=0} in display math mode, the "i=0" is set below the \sum. However with inline math mode, the "i=0" is set more like an index. I think sometime ago I saw a way to set the "i=0" below the \sum in inline mode. Can someone give me a reminder how to do this?
18:49  knittl: ah, label does the job :)
18:49  cfchris6_: (this is in an itemization, so it is not in between some text lines, so the extra height would probably be fine. however using display mode breaks the format of the itemization)
18:53  casdf: sname
18:54  casdf: oops. hi, i have a question about bibtex; how can i put a spanish ene (n with a tilde over it) in a bibtex entry?
18:56  theriel: i'm by no means an expert, but why not just use xelatex and actually type Ã±
18:56  casdf: found it, {\~n}, i was missing the braces.
18:56  casdf: i have not tried xetex
18:57  casdf: or uh, yeah that.
18:58  theriel: i have way too many non-english letters to use the old school latex methods.  but if you've just got one or two you can use \~{n} without a problem
19:04  casdf: thanks for the tip
