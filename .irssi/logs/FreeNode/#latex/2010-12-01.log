00:00  djoef: thank you :)
00:01  |Zz|: you can use Ctrl+F in your browser, to search for a string on that page
00:01  djoef: indeed..
00:02  djoef: I also want to add more information to a table, as you would like to do to explain a figure, sometimes you want to give more information on a table, but adding a line to \caption gives errors
00:02  djoef: anyway, ill look it up now I know where to look
00:03  |Zz|: Ctrl+F "caption" :-)
00:11  |Zz|: anyway, djoef, perhaps the caption is not the proper place to write long explanations. Why not putting it into the table environment (but out of the tabular environment), perhaps before the caption?
00:12  |Zz|: or even better, in the main text, with a \ref to the table, as it is customary :)
00:14  djoef: |Zz|, I do use a ref, but one extra line seemed usefull ;)
00:40  djoef: lets call it a night.. thanks again |Zz|, I believe I will have fun with this latex stuff :)

03:21  Durandal21: What was with Malkavian's bad attitude earlier, anyone know?

03:40  jesse_: In latex beamer, how should I set the color of the itemize text? \setbeamercolor{itemize item} is only for the marker leading the text
03:40  jesse_: hi everyone, i'm jesse. i'm new here
03:40  Durandal21: I'm not very familiar with beamer, I'm afraid.
03:40  jordan`: hi
03:40  jordan`: \setbeamercolor{item}{fg=beamer@blendedblue}
03:40  Durandal21: Hi jesse_
03:41  jordan`: usually you define this in the theme file
03:41  jesse_: hi jordan you're right
03:41  jesse_: but there are those few frames
03:41  jesse_: that i want to set apart with very different colors
03:41  jordan`: i think this command should work
03:42  jesse_: i'll try right now. although i recall item is conceptually the same as itemize item (item is parent of itemize item)
03:44  jesse_: hi jordan
03:45  jesse_: i was right
03:45  jesse_: setting color on item only changes the marker
03:45  jesse_: not the text after the marker
03:45  jesse_: i've gone through beamer user's guide
03:45  jesse_: and wasn't able to find a beamer-color for this, probably coz i don't know now how to call it? "normal text" doesn't help either :(
04:06  jesse_: :(

08:31  trimeta: It just breaks painfully.
08:33  trimeta: Also, yes, somehow all of my commands are in Initial Case rather than ALL CAPS, and I'm not sure how that's working at all.

14:13  Aedolon: Doesn't it fetch it automatically if you include it?
14:13  Lusule: so i just put it anywhere on my system and reference the full path location in the file?
14:13  Aedolon: You can download the package and put it in the packages directory.
14:13  Aedolon: Or in the directory of your file.
14:13  Lusule: thanks, i'm still working from the default latex package, i've never yet modified it
14:14  Aedolon: You should have some client download it for you when you need it.
14:14  Aedolon: You can google for it "install packages latex mac"
14:15  Aedolon: That should help.

16:25  MTecknology: is this not how you define a macro with a 4th option argument?  \def\macroname#1#2#3[#4]{
16:25  marcellus: why aren't you using \newcommand?
16:27  MTecknology: marcellus: that's what I found on google that gave me the most help - give me a second and I'll show you how I'm using it..

16:30  Manny: I want to use align like a table. It works nicely, but I fail to add multiline \text{}. Any ideas?
16:30  MTecknology: marcellus: would \newcommand be best for that?
16:32  marcellus: looks strange   \ifx&#4&%
16:33  jabirali: Manny: Why align instead of tabular?
16:33  Manny: jabirali, because I want to align certain equality signs.
16:33  MTecknology: marcellus: earlier I was trying \ifundefined{#4}
16:36  marcellus: is there such a command?
16:36  MTecknology: marcellus: I'm up for any suggestions - I really don't know latex well at all so I'm struggling pretty hard

16:42  MTecknology: I couldn't understand that last page you sent me - but it does look like what i'm trying to figure out
16:43  martin__: marcellus: I don't want to do it manually.. I want to put something in the top of the latex document to tell it that it can break the words however it wants, just don't overflow the column
16:43  marcellus: martin__: that is what it does
16:43  marcellus: I am guessing you are using p{width} and it will break words
16:43  martin__: yes
16:44  martin__: I have a word not being broken
16:44  marcellus: then you need to supply hyphenation points
16:44  martin__: the word is in all caps, maybe that has an influence

16:46  martin__: the thing is, this latex file is being generated
16:46  martin__: having to know which words will go in there up front would be cumbersome
16:47  martin__: it's the first line in the table that overflows
16:48  MTecknology: marcellus: I'm still lost- any link for some dumbed down info?
16:49  marcellus: MTecknology: use your existing code and \isempty from ifthen package (should probably use \ifthenelse command too)
16:50  MTecknology: marcellus: I'm not fighting with the if, I'm fighting with having it accept an optional arg
16:50  marcellus: \ifthenelse{\isempty{#4}}{ do nothing }{ do something }
16:51  MTecknology: but how do I make it accept the optional arg.....
16:52  MTecknology: if I call that command without the 4th arg, it won't compile

16:54 * marcellus got to go
16:54  martin__: marcellus: thx for the effort :)
16:55  MTecknology: marcellus: same here, i appreciate the attempt
16:56  marcellus: martin__: don't know if you can tell latex to just break whereever but I would ask on tex.stackexchange.com or search comp.text.tex archives
16:56  martin__: marcellus: thx
17:03  marcellus: MTecknology: \newcommand{\optional}[2][default value of first argument]{\ifthenelse{\isempty{#1}}{ print just #2 }{ print #1 and #2 }}   \optional[foo]{bar} => foo and bar   \optional[]{bar} => bar

17:41  Lusule: hi guys, i'm really struggling getting latex to work with my bibtex bibliography.  Ultimately I want to use harvard, but right now I'd settle for getting it to work anyold how.  When I typset my .tex file i just get [?] wherever citations are supposed to be and no bibliography at the end.  Table references are similarly nerfed.  No clue what I've done wrong after spending all day looking at the web :(
17:42  Lusule: my latex file is here: http://lusule.pastebin.com/Hzxr2FNM
17:44  Lusule: correction: I've fixed the table references, that was a simple error.  Just the bibliography is thoroughly nerfed
17:46  Durandal21: randoms: I prefer nccfancyhdr as it offers a little more controland ease of use ,cs nccfancyhdr
17:49  Durandal21: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/ncctools/
17:52  Manny: thanks, see you :)
17:55  Durandal21: Lusule: just to make sure, how many times are you compiling your document, and in what order?
17:57  Lusule: Durandal21 I've literally just figured that part out - if I do \bibliographystyle{plain} and comment out harvard, and first compile as latex, then do a bibtex compile, then do latex again, I think it's working now!  But it still doesn't work if I /usepackage{harvard} and \bibliopgraphystyle{agsm} :(
17:58  Lusule: hmm okay but if i accidentally return to \bibliographystyle{plain} but forget to comment out /usepackage{harvard} it works... I don't understand this thing at all :(
17:58  randoms: how can i use \input{path\to\myfile.tex} when \ is recognized as a command?
17:59  randoms: thank you btw Durandal21 and marcellus.
18:01  randoms: nm that last one, just changed the slash /\
18:01  Durandal21: Lusule: that means including the package is working (not throwing errors), but actually changing your bibliographystyle isn't. Seems silly, but good to check: are you spelling the style correctly (agsm)?
18:02  Durandal21: randoms: you got it ;)
18:03  Lusule: Durandal21: well, I seem to be getting there purely by random trial and error.  I realised that all the associated .bst's are in the Harvard sub-folder.  I copied them up a level and now it's compiling, though I can't tell what difference it's made
18:03  Lusule: but now I can't go back to the standard style of bibliography if i comment the package out again
18:03  Lusule: so i have no idea what's going on
18:04  Lusule: but since harvard is what i want anyway i guess i'll stick with it and hope it doesn't break again
18:05  Durandal21: Lusule: that does seem a little odd, though in general you have to specify a subdirectory if any files aren't in the same directory as your .tex file.
18:09  Durandal21: Lusule: also, a head's up, you may need to run LaTeX a second time after you run BibTeX in some cases, before it looks right.
18:09  Lusule: Durandal21: that may be what's happening - I'm just randomly spamming various compile options until something works :D
18:10  Durandal21: Lusule: in general: latex >> bibtex >> latex >> latex
18:11  Durandal21: I find it handy to use an editor that handles compiling for me. Most editors or editor plugins designed for LaTeX can be pretty smart about what to run how many times, in what order.
18:11  Lusule: i'm using TeXShop which came by default with my MaxTex installation
18:12  Lusule: now I've confirmed that bibtex seems to be working, one way or another, I need to work out how to make it work with Scrivener and Multimarkdown...
18:14  Durandal21: Also, I know trial and error is not the most enjoyable process, but I've found it's one of the ways I personally learn the most completely, haha.
18:14  Durandal21: For each thing I get right, I learn several ways NOT to do things, which generally help later on.
18:37  cryptic0: why does tableof contents looks different in article and report?
18:37  cryptic0: I am using article class and want it to look like report (with dotted lines joining section headings and page numbers)
