00:04  Malkavian_: hi, I am using the document class scrartcl with scrpage2 and I would kile to do the following: mark the header with section, subsection and subsubsection; the command \automark[right]{left} takes only two parameters, but I would like to mark three sectioning levels , not just two of them
00:08  Malkavian_: so how do I get section, subsection and subsubsection in the header - and not just their numbers, but with their names
00:10  Malkavian_: (this is a format requirement which was set to me)

13:03  pico: hi
13:04  pico: i'm trying to use fancy footers. yet inside chapters defined with \chapter* the footers got information (chapter title) from the previsous non starred chapters. any idea on how to update the chapter name inside \chapter* for fancy footers?
13:07 --- eoc` is now known as eoc
13:08  |Zz|: Hm.. I guess that \markboth can be useful..
13:10  |Zz|: assuming that you use \leftmark or \rightmark in your fancy footer definition
13:11  |Zz|: er, is your document two-sided?
13:11  |Zz|: if not, use \markright instead
13:16  Lufti_oO: hello ;)
13:20  Lufti_oO: I'm almost finished with my thesis and noticed a problem. I use a complex template based on class 'book'. The problem is, that when a chapter ends on a right side (book), latex inserts a new page to make the next chapter start on the right side. So every chapter starts on the right side.
13:20  Lufti_oO: I want to avoid this
13:20  Lufti_oO: I have to!
13:20  Lufti_oO: Is this an additional command or is this behavior set by the class 'book'?
13:25  Lufti_oO: Problem solved: Used the keyword 'oneside' in class definition.
13:27  a-v: Lufti_oO, with "oneside" you also disable the two-side page layout, which is probably not what you want since you are using book. Use the "openany" option instead.
13:29  Lufti_oO: thanks a lot!
13:44  pico: |Zz|, thanks, i will look for that. my document is two-sided. i do use \markboth thought. the trouble is the #1 it is given is wrong in \chapter* (but ok with \chapter)
13:46  garulf: Hi...

14:10  accel: sinced metapost generates rasterixed fonts; and latex uses metafont; how does latex generate postscript files ?

17:39  peleg: Hey, I can't seem to control font sizes of math. I have a 10pt article, and I have defined \DeclareMathSizes{10}{3}{3}{3}, but text $math$ text looks just the same (everything is after a \footnotesize command, though; does it matter?)
17:40  peleg: well, yes, it matters. Though, I have to find a way to control it also after the \footnotesize... :)

19:22  jeltsch: Hello. If I write $(\mathit{fun})$, the space between the ( and the f is smaller than if writing $(f)$.
19:22  jeltsch: If I use txfonts or pxfonts, then the ( and the f even overlap.
19:23  jeltsch: Is there a way to automatically get the usual space also if using \mathit?

22:00  ralnaemi: I'm going to lose my mind. I can't figure out how to create deeper sections
22:05  rudi_s: \subsection \subsubsection \paragraph \subparagraph (not sure about that one)
22:05  rudi_s: ralnaemi: ^
22:06  ralnaemi: Yeah, but I'm looking for /subsubsubsubsubsection
22:06  ralnaemi: rudi_s: 3.1.2.3.2
22:07  rudi_s: I don't know how/if that's possible, sorry.
22:07  rudi_s: (Not sure why you need it though.)
22:07  ralnaemi: It
22:07  ralnaemi: It's a deeply nested technical document. With a lot of functional requirements and subfunctional requirements.
22:08  ralnaemi: I know it's possible. I've seen it done. Just need to figure out how.
22:38  |Zz|: you have to define your own sectioning commands and counters
22:38  |Zz|: perhaps there is some package already written to do that, for example for legal documents, or technical manuals
22:39  |Zz|: hmm... this could be ---> http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/alphanum.html
22:41  |Zz|: no, it is not..
22:42  |Zz|: bah, anyway  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=subsubsub
22:43  HT: It is not that difficult: have a look at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Advanced_Topics
22:44  HT: Just create a bunch of counters and some commands for every subsubsubsubsubsubsection
22:44  HT: You can redefine the existing command for sections, but it might be better to create your own (using the old ones)
22:53  HT: I put something together (not tested): http://pastie.org/1348108
23:11  ralnaemi: HT: Doesn't work. For subsubsection and lower it just displays .arabicsubsubsection.arabicsubsubsubsection
23:11  ralnaemi: I know what the problem is. No clue how to fix it, though.
23:13  ralnaemi: Oh, I just fixed it. Add a / after the .
23:14  ralnaemi: This should totally be a package
23:20  Fuco: when I use "a it will draw a with umlauts, how can I prevent that?
23:24  ralnaemi: Here's something else that I wonder about: Why is it that images are sometimes placed BELOW the section they're above in the .tex file
23:25  sum: ralnaemi: depends on the document calss. some classes define barriers for float at section/chatper/part borders
23:26  sum: and see ,,floatbarrier
23:26  fsbot: From memory, figure is stop figures from floating over some point: \FloatBarrier. \usepackage{placeins}
23:26  ralnaemi: Hmm..
23:27  ralnaemi: So I can't have it be like place this image here. And if it doesn't fit, then just move everything to the next page?
23:27 --- Elench` is now known as Guest32025
23:28  ralnaemi: Oh Iiiiiiii get it. Awesome.
23:29  sum: ralnaemi: that's not what a float is supposed t odo
23:30  ralnaemi: I think I broke latex. Who do I ask for my check?
23:30  ralnaemi: Oh, nevermind. Stupidly slow computer.
23:31  ralnaemi: So what I need is non-floating placement?
23:32  ralnaemi: Yess. That is what I need.
23:33  sum: there is some package to create caption etc. without using the figure environment. unfortunately i don't know the name anymore...
23:35  ralnaemi: capt-of
23:35  sum: ,,captof
23:35  fsbot: [google]    http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/capt-of/capt-of.pdf

23:44  marcellus: ralnaemi: ,,titlesec,,   "Creating new levels and changing class"
23:44  fsbot: titlesec is, like, a package that makes modifying the appearance of \chapter, \section, ... easy. http://tug.ctan.org/get/macros/latex/contrib/titlesec/titlesec.pdf
23:50  HT: ralnaemi: have you tried the [H] placement-option
23:51  HT: You have to load the float package to use it, though
23:51  HT: But it is supposed to place a float *HERE* and not somewhere else
