00:02  Zet: I would like to use Visual Basic in Photoshop.
00:11  matsuura: ajikeshi: no, it really doesn't... Word in a Word processor, a toilet has nothing to do with processing words
00:12  matsuura: wtf is wrong with you
00:12  matsuura: perhaps you'd care to elaborate on how I could go about using TeX or something in Word
00:12  ajikeshi: matsuura, because your question is sooo utterly bloody pointless
00:13  matsuura: ajikeshi: are you fucking dumb?
00:13  ajikeshi: you  have to ask in #paycrosoft-word f√ºr advice on word
00:13  matsuura: I want to know how I can use latex in word.. word is what I use to write my papers so I want to know how to use latex in word or something
00:14  Darkly: uh...
00:14  ajikeshi: well... ask the  m$ support...
00:14  matsuura: ajikeshi: just off yourself right now.. record it too...
00:14  ajikeshi: i doubt that anybody here even thought of trying that
00:14  Darkly: Could anyone help me real quick? yes I tried google.
00:14  matsuura: if you cannot, just say you cannot and perhaps point in my the right direction
00:14  matsuura: stop fucking trolling
00:15  matsuura: the shit is annoying as hell
00:15  ajikeshi: lol
00:15 * ajikeshi mutters "dont feed the troll, dont feed the troll"
00:16  metropolis: I love the todonotes package, but for some reason with my version of latex it's broken, where the todo items in the margins' lines do not correctly point to the main body text. are there any alternative packages people can recommend? 
00:16  Darkly: ... I seriously have a question -.-
00:16  matsuura: point taken, you're fucking useless
00:16  matsuura: you all are apparently
00:16  ajikeshi: lol
00:16  Darkly: please? ._.
00:16  ajikeshi: Darkly, go on :D
00:16  Darkly: How do I keep the page numbering after a \part
00:17  ajikeshi: ah
00:17  ajikeshi: darn.. i read that a few days agi
00:17  ajikeshi: ago
00:17  Darkly: someone said use \newcommand{\mypart}[1]{\part{#1}\addtocounter{page}{-1}\thispagestyle{empty}}
00:17  Darkly: er
00:17  Darkly: \newcommand{\mypart}[1]{\part{#1}\addtocounter{page}{-1}\thispagestyle{empty}}
00:17  Darkly: ...
00:17  Darkly: \renewcommand*{\theHchapter}{\thepart.\thechapter}
00:18  Darkly: that
00:18  Darkly: but latex throws me an error
00:19  |Zz|: that "H"...
00:20  ajikeshi: oh
00:20  ajikeshi: ure right
00:20  ajikeshi: didnt see that at first
00:21  Darkly: uh
00:22  Darkly: I think I just got a buffer overflow
00:24  Darkly: whats a runaway definition?
00:26  Zet: I got stuck imagining how you could possibly use latex in ms word. maybe if you wrote like individual tables, figures or equations in latex and then imported those as pdf or ps into word?
00:27  Zet: but that's not using it "in word", more like "with word"
00:27  Darkly: I just snip the tables/equations/images and include them as graphics
00:27  Darkly: although thats kinda counter intuitive
00:28  Darkly: so back to my problem... It says "Tex capacity exceeded" when I remove the H
00:28  Zet: in my opinion, computers in general are kinda counter intuitive :)
00:29  Darkly: Yeah, but then how would you IRC?
00:30  |Zz|: Darkly, ah, of course, your definition of \thechapter includes a "call" to \thechapter, so you are stuck in a infinite recursion loop, which exhausts TeX memory
00:31  |Zz|: metropolis, recompile
00:31  Darkly: Forgive me, but what do I put in lieu of \thechapter?
00:32  ajikeshi: http://bash.org/?934798
00:32  ajikeshi: ^^ wait for it ;)
00:32  Zet: pending moderation
00:32  ajikeshi: yeah :/
00:32  |Zz|: I dont know what you are trying, but the standard approach is to do \let\theoldchapter=\thechapter, and then use \theoldchapter instead of \thechapter in your renewcommand
00:33  Zet: ajikeshi: that could take years at the rate bash is working these days :D
00:33  ajikeshi: well but eventually it will be there :D
00:33  Zet: I'll just keep hitting F5 then
00:33  Darkly: <Darkly> How do I keep the page numbering after a \part
00:35  Darkly: so....
00:36  |Zz|: Darkly, what do you mean? The standard behaviour is to keep the page numbering...
00:36  Darkly: every time I make a new part
00:36  Darkly: the page counter resets to 1
00:36  |Zz|: well, there should be a class or package which redefines \part to provide that behaviour. As said, latex standard behaviour does not do that
00:37  Darkly: uh
00:37  |Zz|: which class are you using?
00:37  Darkly: \usepackage[USenglish]{babel} %francais, polish, spanish, ...
00:37  Darkly: \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
00:37  Darkly: \usepackage[ansinew]{inputenc}
00:37  Darkly: \usepackage{url}
00:37  Darkly: \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}
00:37  Darkly: report
00:37  |Zz|: hm
00:38  |Zz|: nothing suspicious...
00:38  |Zz|: are you editing in windows?
00:39  Darkly: yep
00:39  Darkly: please don't hurt me ._.
00:39  Zet: btw, don't mean to interrupt, but is there a way to get spellchecking in latex? like if you specify the "draft" option, it would mark misspelt words for you?
00:40  |Zz|: hm.. could you paste a minimal sample which shows that behaviour? (use a pastebin, like http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/)
00:40  Darkly: yep
00:40  |Zz|: Zet, no
00:40  |Zz|: you have to use a external spell-checker
00:41  Zet: thought so
00:41  Darkly: if you're editiing with texnic, it has a spellchecker
00:41  Zet: I use gedit :)
00:41  Darkly: @|Zz| a latex sample or just from the document?
00:42  |Zz|: Darkly, a minimal example (including the minimal amount of packages and content) which still shows the problem
00:42  |Zz|: i.e. something I can try and compile in my computer, to investigate it
00:45  |Zz|: Zet, I assume you are in a linux system. You probably have aspell (or ispell) installed
00:45  Darkly:  http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/RDm6lCVG
00:45  |Zz|: look up your package manager for aspell/ispell friendly interfaces
00:46  Darkly: That being said, I didn't write the content.
00:46  |Zz|: perhaps even gedit has some plugin for it
00:46  Darkly: http://library.gnome.org/users/gedit/2.29/gedit-spell-checker-plugin.html.en
00:46  Zet: |Zz|: yeah but those have iffy support for Finnish anyway, so...
00:47  Darkly: finnish?
00:47  BCMM: kile has an embeded terminal emulator and the ability to reload the file if something else changes it
00:47  BCMM: so i just run aspell in that
00:47  Zet: I don't think I've ever had a successful Finnish spellcheck experience on Linux
00:47  BCMM: not even with aspell?
00:47  Zet: never really bothered to learn that stuff actually
00:48  Zet: perhaps I should look into it
00:48  |Zz|: aspell comes with dictionaries for a lot of languages
00:51  Darkly: actually its resetting every chapter
00:52  |Zz|: Darkly, no.. in your sample, the first part does not reset counter
00:53  Darkly: could it be my compiler?
00:53  |Zz|: Let compare the results
00:53  |Zz|: compile the same sample you pasted (i removed the \input{titlepage} since I don't have it)
00:54  Darkly: http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/nb0sPWeh
00:54  |Zz|: I compiled twice (to generate the table of contents), and I can see Chapter 1 in page 4 (after page 3, so not reset)
00:54  Darkly: http://pastebin.tlhiv.org/nb0sPWeh
00:54  Darkly: er
00:54  |Zz|: Then, part II starts in page 7
00:55  Darkly: I didn't really explain my problem well, that was my fault. my problem is that I want the sections to start on the page/total pages
00:55  |Zz|: and the, instead of page 8, I have a unnumbered page (with an abstract)
00:55  |Zz|: and then, instead of page 9, I have page 1. So here the page counter is reset, but I don't think this is because \part, but because the abstract
00:56  Darkly: oh
00:56  Darkly: wow
00:56  |Zz|: Also, remove all those \paragraph{}
00:56  Darkly: I can't believe I never though of that
00:56  |Zz|: what are they supposed to do?
00:56  Darkly: indent
00:56  |Zz|: bad use
00:57  |Zz|: \paragraph is a sectioning command, kind of \subsubsubsection
00:57  Darkly: ah
00:57  |Zz|: Use \indent instead
00:57  Darkly: well each paragraph is sectioned by a \paragraph
00:58  Darkly: it makes a newline as well doesn't it?
00:58  |Zz|: yes, but having a \paragraph whose parent is a \section (instead of \subsubsection) is logically incorrect
00:58  |Zz|: don't use logical markup to achieve phisical markup
00:58  Darkly: ah
00:58  Darkly: that makes sense
00:59  |Zz|: To mark the end of a paragraph, leave a blank line in the source code
00:59  Darkly: so what would I do to alter the abstract environment so it doesn't reset page numbers?
00:59  |Zz|: I think that perhaps the more sensible solution is not using the abstract environment, but having a \chapter*{Abstract}
01:00  |Zz|: or even: \centerline{\textbf{Abstract}}\par  Bla bla .... \cleardoublepage
01:01  Darkly: ok, thanks
01:01  |Zz|: Back to paragraphs... I guess you assumed that \paragraph was the way to mark the beginning of a new paragrap (like the tag <p> in html)
01:01  |Zz|: but this is not the case
01:01  Darkly: yeah
01:02  |Zz|: the command to mark the end of paragraph is \par
01:02  |Zz|: but TeX allows for a nicer shortcut: a blank line
01:02  Darkly: I had about a day to learn it :x
01:02  |Zz|: (that is, two carriage returns in sequence)
01:03  |Zz|: Each time TeX reads two newlines, it translates them for \par
01:03  |Zz|: This shortcut is not only easier to type, it also makes your source more readable
01:03  Darkly: I see.
01:05  |Zz|: Ah, I see that you used a trick to type the "Foreword" page. The same trick can be used for the "Abstract"
01:07  metropolis: |Zz|: thank you
01:22  AleMaxx: hi ppl, how can I write some condition over / under a "=" ?
01:25  AleMaxx: I dont know if the question came through since it forgot to log in: how can I write some condition or any text over / under a "=" in an equation?
01:25  ajikeshi: you could use an eqnarray...
01:25  ajikeshi: or do you mean in the same line?
01:26  AleMaxx: I use an eqnarray*
01:26  AleMaxx: but there should be some command, I tried \over but that didnt work as expected
01:27  ajikeshi: mhh dont have a better idea
01:27  ajikeshi: but there might be someone here who an help
01:28  AleMaxx: somebody on math just told me its \stackrel
01:31  marcellus: ,eqnarray
01:31  fsbot: From memory, eqnarray is Don't use eqnarray! See http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=eqnarray and http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf
01:31  marcellus: ,amsldoc
01:31  fsbot: From memory, amsldoc is the documentation for amsmath and can be found on http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/amsldoc.pdf
