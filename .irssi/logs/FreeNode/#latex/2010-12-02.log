17:37  niklasfi: i have included "amsmath" however i cannot use the "dcases*" environment as stated here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics#The_cases_environment what am i doing wrong?
17:44  hiwk: niklasfi: it says "requires the mathtools package"
17:46  niklasfi: hiwk: thanks...

18:47  Durandal21: what seems to be the trouble?
18:47  fejes: Essentially, my problem is probably something really simple - I'm a complete newb with Latex.
18:47  fejes: I've tried creating a file (references.bib) and then tying it into my document with a \bibliography{references.bib}
18:48  fejes: Is that the right way to go about doing this, or did I completely miss something obvious?
18:48  fejes: when I compile, it says citations are unresolved.
18:48  fejes: "LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references."
18:49 --- Channel #latex was synced in 155 seconds
18:50  |Steve|: \bibliography{references}
18:50  |Steve|: Did you run BibTeX?
18:50  Durandal21: How many times are you compiling, and in what order?
18:50  fejes: no.
18:50  |Steve|: You need to.
18:50  Durandal21: |Steve|: also, that
18:50  fejes: thanks..
18:50  fejes: I'm using Kile... so yeah.  Thought it would do that for me.  Guess not. (=
18:51  |Steve|: The first time you run latex or pdflatex, it creates a .aux file. bibtex reads that to produce a .bbl file.
18:51  |Steve|: Subsequent runs of latex read the .bbl file.
18:51  fejes: ah... 
18:52  |Steve|: Frequently, you'll see people recommend running latex foo; bibtex foo; latex foo; latex foo
18:52  fejes: does that need to have the same name as my main file?
18:52  |Steve|: The .aux will have the same basename.
18:52  fejes: it's complaining it can't find references.aux
18:53  |Steve|: As I said, the .aux will have the same basename as your .tex file.
18:53  fejes: Oh, so I can't have one generic library, and multiple .tex files that use it.
18:54  fejes: Now that is poor modularity.
18:54  fejes: thanks.
18:55  |Steve|: Why can't you?
18:55  fejes: So, just to be clear, every time I start a new .tex file, I have to copy and rename that .bib file to newproject.bib
18:55  |Steve|: no
18:56  |Steve|: The .bib can be named whatever you like.
18:56  fejes: then why does it have to have the same basename?
18:56  |Steve|: It doesn't.
18:56  fejes: I'm suddenly confused as to the meaning of your comment.
18:56  fejes: As I said, the .aux will have the same basename as your .tex file.
18:56  fejes: er... imagine that in quotes.
18:57  fejes: sorry for being dense.
18:57  |Steve|: yes, you're not writing a .aux file.
18:57  |Steve|: You're writing a .bib file.
18:57  fejes: Is the bib file something other than just a text file with the references in it?
18:57  fejes: I'm clearly missing the flow here.
18:58  |Steve|: No, that's exactly what it is.
18:58  |Steve|: When you write \bibliography{references} in your .tex file, LaTeX will write that (or something similar) to the .aux file it produces.
18:59  |Steve|: When BibTeX reads the .aux file, it'll see which .bib file (in this case references.bib) to use and then use that along with the selected BibTeX style file to produce a .bbl.
19:05  fejes: this doesn't seem to be working for me at all.  I just keep getting the error message "I found no \bibdata command---while reading file DuctalCarcinomas.aux"
19:09  |Steve|: Do you have a \bibliographystyle{...}, \bibliography{...} and some \cite or \nocite commands?
19:22  litb: hello all
19:23  litb: i'm searching for a command that places additional space between each row with booktabs
19:23  litb: anyone knows how that works, without manually adding \addlinespace between each row?
19:35  |Steve|: litb: I suggest defining a new macro as the easiest thing to do.
19:35  fejes: sorry - I got dragged away to a meeting for a few minutes.
19:35  fejes: Yes, I do have a \cite{} and a \bibliographystyle{plain}
19:36  |Steve|: litb: Oh, no. You can probably redefine \defaultaddspace
19:36  |Steve|: litb: Something like \defaultaddspace=2\defaultaddspace
19:37  |Steve|: Or \advance\defaultaddspace by 1ex
19:40  |Steve|: Actually, I may be wrong about that. That might just be fore \addlinespace.
19:40  |Steve|: -e
19:41  litb: yeah manual says it's just for \defaultaddspace -.-
19:41  litb: i've defined a new macro now. thanks 
19:42  litb: |Steve|: I'm still a bit unsure when to use the description environment and when to use table
19:42  litb: is there any rule of thumb?
19:42  litb: Like, when you need a longer text => description. When it's only a short "tuple-list like" thing => Table 
19:42  |Steve|: I can't imagine any situations where confusion would arise.
19:43  litb: like, i want to explain the variable classifiers in my language ("static" and "global"). using a table seems overkill
19:43  litb: i've looked into existing books, and at least one uses a description-like appearance
19:44  |Steve|: Yeah. Some sort of list seems better.
19:44  litb: however, a table with two columns "classifier", "description" would also work, but seems an artificial resemblance of the description environment
19:44  marcellus: I don't understand 'overkill'.
19:44  litb: ah i see
19:45  litb: marcellus: like, it seems overkill that it could float and that it has such "obvious" column entries that are naturally implied by the description environment
19:45  |Steve|: I've got to run, but for space between rows in a table, you could probably do \renewcommand\@xtabularcr{\@argtabularcr[12pt]} or whatever space you want.
19:46  litb: but my prof may ask me "why did you use tables here and other forms there" and i'm seeking for a good answer :)
19:46  litb: |Steve|: ah thanks!
19:46  litb: i had no idea that's possible
19:46  |Steve|: \show is your friend.
19:47  litb: i see. tho i'm this noob so i better not try and play with the fire
19:53  marekw2143: how to make tabulators in tex?
19:54  mickep: tabbing environment?
19:54  marekw2143: mickep: when I used \begin{tabbing} text was strangely formed
19:55  mickep: You have to read some documentation on howto use it. I'm off from computer now, hope someone else can help you.
19:58  fejes: does the \blibliography{} tag need to be inside the \begin{document}
19:58  fejes: ?
19:59  fejes: Yay... it works!
20:19 --- NevroPus_ is now known as NevroPus
20:42  cryptic0: How do I get table of contents like "report" class in the "article" class. I want those dotted lines to appear between section name and page number.
20:48  cryptic0: anyone?
20:48  fejes: sorry - I know nothing.  I'm just here for help to.
20:48  fejes: too.
20:50  cryptic0: what's your question fejes
20:51  fejes: someone answered it a while ago.
20:51  fejes: or rather, I found the answer, after someone pointed me in the right direction, but close enough.
20:51  marcellus: look at how \l@section is defined in report vs article
20:53  cryptic0: marcellus:  thanks.
20:57  cryptic0: marcellus:  would that info be in the class manual?
21:05  moshofosho: {\cal{E}}_s &= {\cal{E}}_p}\frac{m}{n} -> this line keeps failing to render properly
21:05  moshofosho: anything wrong with it?
21:06  moshofosho: it works fine here.. wtf? http://mathbin.net/56231
21:08  marcellus: \mathcal ?
21:08  ne: is there an easy way to persistently store the value of a counter at the end of compiling a latex document (e.g., to a file), and read that counter value back in when the document is compiled the next time around?  almost identical to how the table of contents or bib references work, but is there a general-purpose package that provides this pickle/unpickle support?
21:09  moshofosho: oh maybe
21:12  marcellus: I am guessing ,,expl3,, has that feature somewhere
21:12  fsbot: [google]    ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/expl3/expl3.pdf
21:12  fsbot: http://www.latex-project.org/papers/expl3-consolidation.pdf
21:13  moshofosho: marcellus: i'm suspicious of archlinux's texlive distribution
21:13  moshofosho: mathcal didn't work
21:15  marcellus: what is the error?
21:17  ukl: ne: this should be pretty easy using luatex, too.
21:18  moshofosho: marcellus: http://mathbin.net/56233
21:18  marcellus: why all the braces?
21:19  marcellus: and that is not the error
21:19  moshofosho: not the error, but that's what is appearing
21:20  moshofosho: the error is http://mathbin.net/56233
21:23  ne: ukl: interesting, thanks for the pointer.
21:28  moshofosho: marcellus: i tried it without the braces and the subscript would throw it off with just $\cal{E}_p$ but i realize now i need $\mathcal{E}_p$
21:28  moshofosho: still doesn't work... yields that weird m_n thing
21:34  fejes: I'm having problems with the \bibliographystyle{} being accepted.
21:34  fejes: any clues on how to get that to work?
21:34  fejes: "I couldn't open style file science.bst"
21:35  niklasfi: i have several theorems. how do i get them to all share the same numbering scheme?
21:35  fejes: I've put Science.bst in the /usr/local/share/texmf directory, and then run texhash
21:35  fejes: do I need to do something else too?
21:35  moshofosho: marcellus: oh dude, i got it. stupid double }
21:36  fejes: is it case sensitive?
21:45  ezzieyguywuf: I have some figures which overlap some of the text that come beforet them. How can I prevent this short of manually inputting enough \\ to compensate?
21:48  marcellus: fejes: texmf/bibtex/bst/
21:48  fejes: I need to make that dir, then,  marcellus?
21:48  fejes: or should it be there by default?
21:48  marcellus: yes
21:48  fejes: hrm.
21:49  fejes: and the sty files also go there?
21:51  fejes: that didn't work.
21:52  fejes: any more advice?
21:54  EvilGuru: I want to, in math mode, say something is ~nm, but \sim includes spacing between itself and the n, how can I get the non binary relation version of \sim?
21:57  fejes: ok, since I can't get latex to recognize the .bst file automatically, can I give it a path to where the bst file is?
22:02  Tasser: uhm, 
22:02  Tasser: ! Package inputenc Error: Unicode char \u8:≥ not set up for use with LaTeX.
