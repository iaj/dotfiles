01:04 iaj: hmmm 
01:04 iaj: yeah I'm using c-[ too
01:04 iaj: but.. like everywhere.. heh
01:04 iaj: Which PDF Viewer are you using?
01:04 iaj: Isnt there some vim like one?
01:04 Araxia_: i use skim
01:05 iaj: I do too.. but this one lacks vimkeys:(
01:05 iaj: Which hotkeys do you use there?
01:05 Araxia_: heh. with kr4mb, nothing lacks vim keys.
01:05 iaj: did you do kr4mb with skim?
01:06 iaj: Well I was thinking about trying that
01:06 iaj: but I'm scared that I'm gonna lose ubiquitious VIM
01:06 iaj: if I play around with it :)
01:06 iaj: And don't have your source anymore
01:06 Araxia_: iaj. ubiqvim is part of the standard kr4mb now.
01:06 iaj: It is?
01:07 Araxia_: yup. and a nice thing is that the latest builds allow you to add new modifications without rebuilding. just modify the xml and reload it.
01:08 iaj: AAhhhhhh  ::))

01:11 --- Query: Starting query with Araxia_ on FreeNode
01:11 iaj: Ahhww.. Okay its working now
01:11 iaj: So how/where is that XML I need to edit?
01:15 Araxia_: go to the "misc & uninstall" tab and hit the "open private.xml" buttom.
01:16 iaj: Yay
01:16 iaj: I'm in :)
01:16 iaj: You got an skim entry in there?
01:17 iaj: Or better, can you share yours?  For me to get an impression?
01:17 Araxia_: no. it works fine with the default application bindings. and it doesn't recognize skim anyway.
01:17 iaj: Really :-)   Which bindings do you use/
01:22 Araxia_: mostly just <C-f> and <C-b>. i've been using simultaneous vi mode with f = fn a lot, too. so s+d+f together with hjkl for home, pgdn, pgup, end.
01:24 iaj: How did you get C-f and C-b to work?
01:24 iaj: What do I need for that :D
01:24 iaj: And simultaneous vi mode is new to me as well
01:24 iaj: omg Im so dumb
01:24 Araxia_: not dumb. this thing has > 400 settings. :-)
01:25 iaj: So I can find all your stuff in the settings?
01:25 Araxia_: pretty much. under "ubiquitous vim bindings" and "simultaneous vi mode".
01:26 Araxia_: best thing is to turn on one thing at a time and play around with it so you understand what it's doing (or find the corresponding xml bits in the sourcecode).
01:26 iaj: XML bits in the source code.. where is that.. but yeah... I guess your right.
01:30 Araxia_: if you grab the source from the site, the config settings are in ..../files/prefpane/ and ..../files/prefpane/include
01:31 iaj: Ohh alright, thanks:DD
01:31 iaj: Which settings have you enabled in ubi vim?
01:31 iaj: ehm on KeyRemap4MB?
01:32 Araxia_: mostly just ubiqvim and simultaneous vi mode. a sprinkling of others.
01:33 iaj: S+D for simultaneous VI Mode??
01:33 Araxia_: <C-[> to <Esc>
01:33 Araxia_: yeah. home row.
01:33 iaj: I activated ti
01:33 iaj: Do i have to reload now or something?
01:33 Araxia_: you can adjust the threshold for what is recognized as simultaneous if the default doesn't suit you.
01:33 iaj: Shift- âŒ˜  and j should scroll now in vim?
01:34 iaj: ehm
01:34 iaj: in skim
01:34 Araxia_: iaj: no the literal s and d keys.
01:34 iaj: Ohhhhhhhh
01:34 Araxia_: push them both at the exact same time.
01:35 iaj: Thats neat, hehe I like it :)
01:35 iaj: C-f and C-b isn't working for me in skim tho
01:36 Araxia_: yeah, i guess that doesn't actually work since the mapping is to option-pgdn and option-pgup
01:36 Araxia_: guess i've really adopted simultaneous vi mode there.
01:37 iaj: hmmmm so how do I navigate in skim now :)
01:37 iaj: so you only use sd +jk?
01:37 Araxia_: there's another option under simvi mode [Option]F to FN. activate that and then you can do sdf+j and sdf+k
01:38 iaj: huh? sdf + j ? so 3 keypresses?
01:38 iaj: for simult. vi mode...
01:38 iaj: what's its advantage over just sd?
01:38 Araxia_: pgup and pgdn.
01:39 iaj: Oh..
01:39 iaj: sdf+j is page down then
01:39 iaj: Now i get it
01:39 iaj: lol
01:39 Araxia_: sd+j = down arrow, sdf+j = pgdn.
01:39 Araxia_: yeah.
01:39 Araxia_: you stay completely on homerow.
01:40 iaj: Hmm the hitting of all the 3 keys is kinda hard, isn't it:)
01:42 Araxia_: not at all. it's like a 2mm movement.
01:45 iaj: hmmm yeah I guess one needs to get accustomed to it a bit :)
01:45 iaj: Any else stuff you are using?
01:45 Araxia_: that's about it.
