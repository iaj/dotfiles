22:20 --- Query: Starting query with Araxia_ on FreeNode
22:20 iaj: heyho))
22:20 iaj: thanks for the help
22:21 Araxia_: hey. how are things going?
22:22 iaj: they are fine.. had my day off today and... ONLY chilling :)
22:22 iaj: @ your side/
22:23 iaj: before I forget it... you are using a shell as well I suppose?
22:23 Araxia_: i use bash for now.
22:24 Araxia_: just found this awesome dashboard widget yesterday: http://islayer.com/apps/istatpro/
22:25 iaj: haha.. I almost never see my desktop
22:25 iaj: that's my problem :)
22:25 iaj: bash with vibinds/
22:26 Araxia_: dashboard isn't desktop, though. there's a mode where you can make dashboard widgets windows that float over all others, too. useful when you've got screen real estate to burn. :-)
22:26 Araxia_: yeah, i use readline vi mode in bash.
22:28 iaj: hm ok ill give it a try - it seems interesing =) thanks for the tip
22:28 iaj: how do you abort vi mode in bash?
22:28 iaj: eg go to normal mode?
22:28 Araxia_: i
22:29 Araxia_: or a
22:29 Araxia_: although really vi mode *is* normal mode. :-)
22:29 iaj: huuh?
22:29 iaj: i mean the way back
22:29 iaj: from editing to normal/vi mode
22:29 iaj: :)
22:30 iaj: vi mode = insert mode .. haha. that's what i ment at my first post.
22:32 Araxia_: esc
22:33 iaj: the real escape WOW
22:33 iaj: :-)
22:33 iaj: you actually use it
22:34 iaj: I was wondering because I was trying to get into C-c habit
22:34 iaj: but.. failed on zsh
22:35 Araxia_: yeah, readline vi is not too flexible, unfortunately. you can use <C-[>, too, which is what i'm more likely to do.
