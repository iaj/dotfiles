03:07  therrell: Hi is anyone here experienced using NSTrackingArea and other means to track current mouse position in your applications?
03:08  therrell: I'm stuck with a problem and was hoping someone might have a suggestion for a solution
03:08  unsoughtdesire: Er, give it a shot :P
03:08  therrell: unsoughtdesire: Just posted this before you joined the room: "Hi is anyone here experienced using NSTrackingArea and other means to track current mouse position in your applications?"
03:09  unsoughtdesire: Answer from my end is a definite no.
03:10  therrell: unsoughtdesire: okay, thanks :) I know its probably something most developers haven't had to bother with
03:10  therrell: unsoughtdesire: how about capturing mouse events in a custom view?
03:10  unsoughtdesire: Yeah, it's quite amazing just how much there is you can know, but at the same time not know anything :P
03:11  therrell: unsoughtdesire: indeed
03:11  unsoughtdesire: Custom view, as in NSView subclass?
03:11  therrell: unsoughtdesire: yeah
03:11  unsoughtdesire: You'd like to respond to mouse events...
03:12  therrell: unsoughtdesire: Yeah, I know how to do it by overriding methods in my custom view
03:13  therrell: unsoughtdesire: I'm trying to implement this app with strict MVC design, and I'd like my Controller class to be able to handle the mouse left click down/up, right click down/up events
03:14  unsoughtdesire: How about using the -(void)mouseDown: methods inside your custom view, but instead of doing anything, simply message your controller, passing the NSEvent along?
03:14  therrell: unsoughtdesire: I thought of that, just wasn't sure if there would be a more efficient approach
03:15  unsoughtdesire: Hmm.
03:15  therrell: unsoughtdesire: I'll just stick with your suggestion for now, its definitely a solution and will work well
03:15  unsoughtdesire: Not that I can think of... but if you want the honest truth, I'm only a 16 year old, hardly the definitive "go-to" for these types of questions...
03:15  unsoughtdesire: I'm mainly here to learn :\
03:16  therrell: unsoughtdesire: thats cool, your suggestion is still a good one
03:16  unsoughtdesire: I run into the same issues, trying to follow the MVC pattern.... It's confusing sometimes...
03:18  therrell: unsoughtdesire: Yeah I'm now implementing MVC with a Controller class having an instance of a view and a model object.
03:20  therrell: unsoughtdesire: I suppose my model should probably be a static class and follow the singleton pattern so that I could add more view/controller pairs which could access the same model or application state

03:50  diffract|: i'm trying to uninstall xcode but when i run the install script it says "Can't determine system version." what should i do?
04:11  yohan14: I'm trying to compile and statically link all libraries to my binary so that the mac that runs it will need need the libraries to dynamically link at runtime. I've tried including the -static flag, but I get ld: library not found for -lcrt0.o
