17:43  yazdmich: if im new to programming, is objective c a good language to start with?
17:44  crilly: Yes.
17:44  yazdmich: ah
17:44  yazdmich: good
17:44  yazdmich: i already have the dev suite on my macbook
17:44  crilly: Because C is a good language to begin with, and ObjC is a superset of C, so you'll gain the C knowledge and OOP knowledge/experience, too.
17:44  yazdmich: ah
17:46  yazdmich: but for now its only mirc scripting for me, my macbook upper half is broken
17:46  yazdmich: :(
17:46  yazdmich: but i already have some done
17:46 * yazdmich hands crilly a plate of 1337 chocolate chip cookies and a glass of H4X0R milk
17:49 * yazdmich teleports away from crilly
17:50  crilly: :/
17:51  yazdmich: yeah
17:51  yazdmich: its windows, but macbook as i said, is broken
17:52  yazdmich: but my*
17:54  crilly: Well just remember that ObjC is pretty much only useful on OS X.
17:55 * Beelsebob produces applications for linux with Obj-C
17:55  crilly: Well, there are some uses for it outside of OS X, of course.
17:55  Psy: http://snap.sonydeveloper.com/pages/develop/
17:56  crilly: But then again, why would you want to develop for an OSS POS like Linux?
17:58  Psy: maaaaaaan
17:58  Psy: what a bunch of retards for the Snap project
17:58  Psy: #include <SNRemoting/SNRemoteObject.h> !!!
17:58  Psy: #include seriously ?!
17:58  crilly: Looks interesting. Not something I'll bother with though.
18:02  jubei: do these errors mean anything to you guys? http://ploader.net/files/edb0095cc73e5dbbf1f4b78ea62927be.png
18:03  Psy: missing headers ?
18:03  Psy: #include <cstdlib>
18:04  jubei: Psy: thanks for trying to help but that didn't make any difference
18:04  jubei: the code is very simple
18:04  jubei: http://codepad.org/pUrDTm0z
18:05  jubei: i think it's related to string.h
18:11  yazdmich: heh
18:11  yazdmich: my dad uses ubuntu un his laptop
18:11  yazdmich: i could never configure ubuntu
18:13  yazdmich: but that was on a pentium 4 with less than a gig of ram
18:14  crilly: I thought Ubuntu was meant to do somewhat "configuration-less"
18:14  crilly: ?
18:14  yazdmich: nope
18:15  yazdmich: tried to configure an ethernet connection to the router
18:15  yazdmich: no network found
18:16  yazdmich: windows and OSX both automaticly connect to ethernet connections
18:16  yazdmich: i guess ubuntu didn't have the drivers for my ethernet card
18:19  yazdmich: im also glad i didn't have to use a reversing cable to transfer my 6 GB music library from my netbook to my macbook
18:21  yazdmich: just used a random yellow ethernet cable in our computer cord box
18:23  yazdmich: it might have been a crossover actually
18:24  yazdmich: i had an intuition it was better that the blue one connected to the router that was availible
18:26  jubei: anybody know if the SDK is relevant to the compiler? i.e. does CLANG have any issues with my osx headers? /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1/cstring
18:26  crilly: Doesn't matter these days. Most modern NICs on PCs/Netbooks/Laptops and switches/routers use auto-mdix to change the PIN configuration they use internally, sending the signals down the correct PINs.
18:27  crilly: Although using the correct cable is best practice in the first place, it's generally no biggie these days.
18:28  yazdmich: ah
18:28  yazdmich: it was a yellow cable
18:29  jubei: Psy: the issue was the "recursive" option in the include paths. just for future reference
18:29  yazdmich: i vividly remember, it took about a hour to transfer the 6 GB of music
18:30  crilly: Sounds like a 10BASE-T cable.
18:30  yazdmich: which somehow takes less than 1 GB of space on my ipod
18:31  yazdmich: 1 sec
18:31  yazdmich: let me get the cable in question
18:31  crilly: Yeah a 10BASE-T would take about 80 minutes to transfer 6GB.
18:31  crilly: At the full 1.2MB/s.
18:32  crilly: WHich I doubt you will get a full 1.2MB/s, due to other factors.
18:34  yazdmich: its a CAT 5
18:35  yazdmich: but how can 6 GB on my computer be less than 1 GB on my ipod?
18:37  yazdmich: some extra commpresion during syncing?
18:37 * yazdmich np:  I'm on a Mac ft. Pakwit (Clean) by:  Beau-J & Furia
18:38  crilly: Possibly.
18:38  crilly: Not sure.
18:39  yazdmich: its crazy commpresion then
18:39  yazdmich: same quality on computer and ipod
18:44  [Anthony]: Hi
18:44  [Anthony]: I was wondering if that licence slide down popup thingie is usable in custom cocoa apps. I couldn't find it in the interface builder list.
18:46  Psy: it's just a scroll view that is scrolled programmatically with a timer
18:46  [Anthony]: oh
18:46  [Anthony]: what about the curvy bit at the top?
18:46  Psy: NSTextView
18:46 @Beelsebob: the license slide down?
18:47  [Anthony]: yup
18:47 @Beelsebob: where do you see it?
18:47  Psy: curvy bit ?
18:47  [Anthony]: erm not curvy
18:47  [Anthony]: the bit where it looks like it's coming out of a hole
18:48  Psy: what application are you talking about ?
18:48  [Anthony]: I suppose that's just an image
18:48  [Anthony]: most installer
18:48  [Anthony]: *installers
18:48  Psy: screenshot
18:48  [Anthony]: http://www.jumsoft.com/operation/ third screenshot for exalmple
18:49  Psy: haaaa
18:49  Psy: that's a window sheet
18:49  [Anthony]: a what now?
18:49  Psy: window sheet
18:50  Psy: you go in NSWindow class reference and you look for the word sheet
18:50  [Anthony]: k
18:52  [Anthony]: hmm I'll google it
19:01 @Beelsebob: [Anthony]: the basic idea is that it's a modal dialog without being fully modal
19:01 @Beelsebob: you still get to interact with the application
19:01 @Beelsebob: just not with the window the sheet is attached to
19:02  [Anthony]: right
19:02  [Anthony]: I find it quite nice for 'New Object' forms
19:13  yazdmich: HMM
19:13  yazdmich: just thought of something
19:15  yazdmich: why do some mac apps come as a package installer and others just come as a .app file?
19:15  yazdmich: hello?
19:15  Zorg: this is irc, no one has to instantly respond
19:15  yazdmich: i know
19:16  yazdmich: i tj
19:16  yazdmich: thought*
19:16  Zorg: shipping .app files is very sane and preferred
19:16  yazdmich: that there were active people
19:16  Zorg: some apps need to use package installer to install stuff in some placesâ€¦. or they just use it 'just because' and are dumb
19:16  yazdmich: ah
19:16  yazdmich: yeah
19:17  yazdmich: dragging a .app file to the applications folder is so quick compared to using a package installer
19:18  yazdmich: but im glad i dont have to close every open program on my mac when i use a package installer so i dont have to reboot
19:18  yazdmich: whoa
19:19  yazdmich: "i dont have to" is lined up with itself
19:19  yazdmich: freaky
19:22  crilly: OS X has "package installer" style installation methods too.
