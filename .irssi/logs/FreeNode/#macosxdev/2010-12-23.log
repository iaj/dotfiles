10:19  TzilTzal: Is there an apple version for gcc > 4.4?
10:19  TzilTzal: like 4.0 and 4.2?
10:34 @Beelsebob: TzilTzal: no, gcc on OS X (it's official support at least) is deprecated
10:34 @Beelsebob: use clang
10:35  TzilTzal: :(
10:35  TzilTzal: why?
10:35 @Beelsebob: because of oh so many reasons why clang is better
10:37  TzilTzal: what does macport use then?
10:37 @Beelsebob: it's faster, it's more flexible, it produces faster code, it can be used in other tools to do parsing/analysis work, it can be used to link code from multiple frontends of llvm, it uses much less RAM, it provides better error messages, it can be used to JIT code if it's more efficient, and last but not least...
10:37 @Beelsebob: Apple BSD licensed it
10:37 @Beelsebob: rather than GCC which is GPLv3
10:38 @Beelsebob: TzilTzal: it uses CC
10:38 @Beelsebob: (i.e. whatever you have your default compiler set as)
10:38  TzilTzal: it's not set
10:38 @Beelsebob: the most likely, it being a fairly old app it uses gcc as a fallback
10:39 @Beelsebob: just set CC to clang, and you're done though :)
10:39  TzilTzal: is clang the same as llvm-gcc42?
10:39 @Beelsebob: no
10:40 @Beelsebob: that's the gcc 4.2 front end, and the llvm back end
10:40  TzilTzal: I can see there are two darwin flavours of gcc installed by default... 4.0 and 4.2... those aren't clang, r they?
10:40 @Beelsebob: no, they aren't
10:41  TzilTzal: what debugger works with clang?
10:41 @Beelsebob: Wraith:~ tatd2$ which clang
10:41 @Beelsebob: /usr/bin/clang
10:41 @Beelsebob: Wraith:~ tatd2$ clang -v
10:41 @Beelsebob: Apple clang version 1.6 (tags/Apple/clang-70)
10:41 @Beelsebob: both gdb and lldb
10:41 @Beelsebob: (note, lldb is apple's debugger, which is designed to take over from gdb over time)
10:42  TzilTzal: http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.8
10:42  TzilTzal: seems like they have the llvm I was talking about
10:42  TzilTzal: llvm-gcc4.2
10:42 @Beelsebob: they also have clang there...
10:44  TzilTzal: can I write pretty printers for boost and such?
10:44 @Beelsebob: you can
10:44 @Beelsebob: being able to compile boost was pretty much the "yay, we can pretty much do all of C++ moment for clang"
10:45 @Beelsebob: it's now 99% of the way to C++0x
10:46  TzilTzal: interesting.
10:47  TzilTzal: so what language does llvm compile exactly?
10:47  TzilTzal: they just say 'compiler' on the website
10:47 @Beelsebob: llvm bytecode ;)
10:47 @Beelsebob: LLVM is the low level virtual machine
10:47  TzilTzal: "Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines"
10:47  TzilTzal: I thought it was *not* a virtual mahine
10:48  TzilTzal: *machine
10:48 @Beelsebob: it is a VM… but not the kind you're thinking of
10:48 @Beelsebob: it provides a portable bytecode (virtual machine) that various front ends can produce
10:48  TzilTzal: I was actually thinking more along the lines of something like the .NET platform
10:48  TzilTzal: or Java
10:48 @Beelsebob: the LLVM compiler then compiles that into native code for the machine you're on
10:48 @Beelsebob: yes, that's closer than what most people would think, but not quite there
10:48 @Beelsebob: because it compiles it
10:48  TzilTzal: so it's similar to what C# does
10:49 @Beelsebob: well C# JITs
10:49 @Beelsebob: LLVM can be used to JIT
10:49  TzilTzal: yes
10:49 @Beelsebob: but usually doesn't
10:49 @Beelsebob: so with that established...
10:49 @Beelsebob: clang is a front end for LLVM
10:49 @Beelsebob: which takes C, C++, ObjectiveC, ObjectiveC++, and produces LLVM bytecode
10:49  TzilTzal: isn't that a bit of a fraud though? :) C/C++ is supposed to give you pretty much full control...
10:50 @Beelsebob: not really no
10:50 @Beelsebob: LLVM bytecode gives you fine grained control over what happens on the machine
10:51 @Beelsebob: if it didn't, you wouldn't be able to implement C compilers on it ;)
10:53  TzilTzal: well... potentially you could also implement Java & C# on it, couldn't you?
10:55  Axman6: people have
10:56  Axman6: in the same project in fact (though the java stuff got dropped i believe)
10:56  TzilTzal: C#?
10:56  TzilTzal: I thought that pretty much the only availability of C# outside of Windows was with mono
10:58 @Beelsebob: TzilTzal: yes, you can pretty much implement any language you like in it
10:58 @Beelsebob: it's becoming the gold standard for any new language
10:59  TzilTzal: so is there a C# compiler? :)
10:59 @Beelsebob: not sure
10:59  Axman6: also, mono now uses llvm i believe
10:59 @Beelsebob: oh, okay
10:59  Axman6: http://dotnet.dzone.com/articles/mono-28-new-gc-c-40-and-llvm
10:59  Axman6: http://vmkit.llvm.org/OpenProjects.html is what i was talking about earlier
10:59 @Beelsebob: most people treat LLVM as a tool that allows them (a) to not have to implement backends for shit tons of platforms (b) to get a big set of optimisations for free without implementing anything themself
11:03 * Axman6 teats LLVM as a sex toy and wants to have its babies
11:04 @Beelsebob: kinky
11:06  Axman6: also, death to gcc, long live the clang!
11:09  TzilTzal: apparently there's some clang installed in /usr/bin... a very old one.
11:09  TzilTzal: how do I remove it?
11:09  Axman6: what version?
11:09  Axman6: it's likely to be Apple's release version, unless it's really really old...
11:09  TzilTzal: 1.0.2
11:09  Axman6: heh, yeah that's quite old
11:09  TzilTzal: it's 2.8 now, isn't it?
11:10  TzilTzal: I can't really find anything on how to install it...
11:11  Axman6: actually, i'm not sure clang's version numbers follow llvm's... Beelsebob, can you check what version of clang you have installed?
11:12  TzilTzal: I just --version on the clang I downloaded...
11:12  Axman6: ok
11:12 @Beelsebob: clang's versions do follow LLVMs
11:13 @Beelsebob: but they didn't used to
11:13  Axman6: ah, i see
11:13 @Beelsebob: if you have the most recent Xcode tools TzilTzal, you should have clang 1.6
11:13 @Beelsebob: so download a new Xcode ;)
11:13 @Beelsebob: with [4DACTED] you should have 2.0
11:13 @Beelsebob: IIRC the version after 2.0 is 2.7
11:13 @Beelsebob: and then the current one
11:13  TzilTzal: the new Xcode is like 3 GBs!
11:13 @Beelsebob: yes it is
11:14 @Beelsebob: set it downloading over night
11:14  Axman6: 5 with iOS dev stuff right?
11:14  TzilTzal: maybe I'll just compile one with macports ;)
11:14 * Axman6 suggests you check out homebrew
11:14 @Beelsebob: Axman6: IIRC you can't get it without the iOS dev kit any more
11:14  TzilTzal: you prefer it to macports?
11:15  Axman6: hmm, you may be right, i remember the link being broken last time i tried
11:15  Axman6: TzilTzal: i do
11:15  Axman6: less pain
11:15  TzilTzal: why's that?
11:15  Axman6: well, so far anyway
11:15  Axman6: it's better thought out i think
11:17  TzilTzal: like how?
11:17  Axman6: there's plenty of articles that explain it
11:19  TzilTzal: oh, well... I already have everything compiled with macports
11:21  Axman6: :\
11:21  Axman6: i'm a long time macports user, making the change wasn't taken lightly. just go and read some articles
11:22  Axman6: the fact it can use your system installed things like ruby and python makes life a hell of a lot easier
11:26  Axman6: when i say long time, i meant over 5 years
11:38  TzilTzal: wait... has xcode 4 been released?!
11:38 @Beelsebob: no
11:38 @Beelsebob: DP 5 is out for registered, paid up devs though
11:38  TzilTzal: ahh.. it's a preview download
11:38 @Beelsebob: it's a disaster zone
11:38  TzilTzal: heheh
11:38  TzilTzal: why?
11:39 @Beelsebob: because it has a crappy inflexible single window UI
11:40 @Beelsebob: that basically only works right if you're working on a single 1680x1050 screen
11:40 @Beelsebob: I've met two people who like it
11:40 @Beelsebob: the first thing I said to both of them was "let me guess, you have a 1680x1050 screen"
11:40 @Beelsebob: both of them did
11:40  cnf: hehe
11:40 @Beelsebob: it's craptacular on smaller screens, it's a waste of space on larger screens, and it's just downright impossible on multiple screens
11:40  cnf: that sucks
11:43  Axman6: weak :\
11:44 @Beelsebob: each window has a minimum size of 1024x768, so it's useless as a single source code window
11:44 @Beelsebob: each window actually represents your project, not a source file
11:44 @Beelsebob: so it's name in the title bar, and in expose is your project name
11:44  Axman6: just use TextMate as your editor ;)
11:44 @Beelsebob: it doesn't support external editors
11:45  Axman6: ... whaaa?
11:45  Axman6: :#
11:45 @Beelsebob: see what I mean about being shittacular?
11:45  Axman6: uh yah
11:45  Axman6: what the fuck Apple? how arrogant can you get?
11:45 @Beelsebob: so further to the other shittacularities...
11:46 @Beelsebob: each window can be split at most 4 times
11:46 @Beelsebob: the left most split *always* shows your project hierarchy
11:46 @Beelsebob: the right most split *always* shows useless junk (unless it's a nib you're editing)
11:46 @Beelsebob: the two that are left get to show source code, and can't be further split up
11:46 @Beelsebob: the left hand one you can select what it shows
11:47 @Beelsebob: the right hand one, [4DACTED] guesses (badly) what you want
11:47 @Beelsebob: if your window is narrower than 1680 pixels then you can't see 80 columns in the two source views
11:47  Axman6: so spews for me
11:47 @Beelsebob: if it's wider than 1680 pixels then you waste massive amonuts of space in them because you can't split them any more
11:48 @Beelsebob: if you create another window, you get all this project clutter all over again
11:48 @Beelsebob: you can create tabs… which is nice
11:48 @Beelsebob: but...
11:48 * Axman6 is at the moment using xmonad on two 30" screens
11:48 @Beelsebob: tabs are only useful for some things
11:48 @Beelsebob: I want to be able to have fuck tons of source windows open, side by side
11:48 @Beelsebob: and be able to cross reference between them
11:48 @Beelsebob: and overlap them
11:48 @Beelsebob: and use exposé to find the one I want at any one time
12:00  Axman6: so, i've been using vim for the past month, i don't see any huge advantage. i was far more productive with textmate (though, i probably haven't been using some important features i should be)
12:07  cnf: Axman6: you scared him off
