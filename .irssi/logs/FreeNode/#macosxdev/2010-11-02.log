14:30  systema: does anyone have documentation detailing LINKEDIT internals, re: mach-o ?
14:31  systema: I know it contains relocatable table entries, symtab and strtab, but I'll looking for an authoritative source.
14:53  bavarious: systema: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/Reference/reference.html
15:01  systema: bavarious: That is not documentation detailing LINKEDIT internals.
15:03  bavarious: i'm not sure what you mean, then. at any rate, http://developer.apple.com
15:07  bavarious: maybe this? http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/
15:27  systema: It does not even mention LINKEDIT ...
15:27  systema: bavarious: Thanks :)
15:27  bavarious: what is LINKEDIT anyway?
15:27  bavarious: do you mean linker?
15:28  bavarious: LINKEDIT for me is the linker i used to use on ms-dos back in the day :)
