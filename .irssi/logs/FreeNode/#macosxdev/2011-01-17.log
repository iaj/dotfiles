00:13  pokerl: hi!
00:13  pokerl: anyone around here with commandline skills?
00:14  pokerl: need to put the display preferences to default... mirroring is checked.. and when i plug in the external display i only see colored distortions (stripes), only the mouse pointer is crisp clear visible... so i need to do it per commandline because, preferences for external display and mirroring only appear when ext. disp. is conn.

14:44  johnharden: hi there. I am wondering if it is possible to link the intValue of a slider to an int in applescript. I have an ib slider and I want to link its intValue to the value in "set volume x" here is what I have tried so far. [NSString stringWithFormat:@"set volume %d", [volumeSlider intValue]]
14:54  johnharden: does anyone know howo I can do this?

23:20  Mikael: Anybody have any luck using UAZoomChangeFocus() to emulate Ctrl-Scroll on Snow Leopard? The only thing I can find on it is a single call somewhere in some WebKit C++, and a dev forum post saying that it fails with a noErr OSStatus (which is my problem as well) :/
23:20  Mikael: I'm like this close to opening Carbon's Box, emulating mouse and keyboard events manually: â€–
23:21  Mikael: UAZoomEnabled correctly returns TRUE iff I'm not fully zoomed out, and manual zoom works ok.
