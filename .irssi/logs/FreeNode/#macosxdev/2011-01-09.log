22:24  crilly: I'm looking at this: http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/2009/03/global-keyboard-shortcuts-with-carbon.html - and I'm wondering if it is actually possible to detect when the left Option key is pressed and if that press can be /dev/null'd (if you like)? Basically, intercept it and bin it so nothing gets it.
