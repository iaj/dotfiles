13:51  jacksson: hi! Is there a way for an application to delete it's own bundle?
13:55  jacksson: i can't let user to just "move bundle into the trash bin" because that bundle contains a background process, thus i have a "Uninstall" button in the control panel of my app that is supposed to stop that Agent, delete this agent's plist file, and then (hopefully) delete application's bundle. I have some problem with the last part, though
13:59  jacksson: asking a user to move the bundle manually to the trash seems pathetic to me :)
13:59  jacksson: because he already clicked "uninstall"

18:46  Nixon_: crilly i'm not much of a cocoa programmer, but i guess you will want to "delete" your element from nsview to hide, and then, to show it, add it there
18:46 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 101 seconds
18:48  Nixon_: crilly: here's what i am doing: [[myWindow contentView] addSubview:myCheckbox]; - to show it on window
18:48  Nixon_: [myCheckbox removeFromSuperview] - to hide it
18:50  bavarious: bear in mind that removeFromSuperview releases the view so you need to retain it if you need to keep it around
18:51  crilly: I just want to hide an NSSecureTextField and replace it with an NSTextField containing the name text.
18:51  crilly: setHidden doesn't redraw the item as hidden on the form (and thus bringing forward the non-secure NSTextField).
18:52  bavarious: you can use replaceSubview:with: for that. my previous message still applies -- the previous view will be released
18:53  crilly: OK, so increase the retain count then?
18:54  crilly: So do a retain, then replace?
18:54  Nixon_: and that replaced thing will have counter set to 2?
18:54  bavarious: i'd retain it only once, regardless of replaceSubview:with:
18:58  crilly: bavarious: http://pastebin.com/RvcrG9ZY
18:58  crilly: bavarious: Like that?
18:58  crilly: I don'r suppose the setHiddne: calls are evn required.
18:58  crilly: setHidden:*
19:00  Nixon_: its not needed
19:00  bavarious: hmm, nope. i'd retain it when the view/window is loaded
19:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#macosxdev +o Beelsebob]
19:02  bavarious: also, replaceSubview:with: should be sent to the superview
19:04  crilly: bavarious: so it should be [self ...]?
19:05  bavarious: i dunno your view hierarchy, crilly. see Nixon_'s example: he uses [myWindow contentView] as the superview when sending addSubview:
19:10  Nixon_: crilly have you put both text boxes in interface builder? masked one and a normal one?
19:11  crilly: Nixon_: yeah that's ezactly the case at present
19:11  Nixon_: so first you have to "hide" one of them, by steps 1)retaining it 2) removing from the superview
19:12  Nixon_: somewhere when your window is loaded already, in the beginning
19:18  Nixon_: crilly: http://www.pnelsoncomposer.com/software/NewbieFAQ.html
19:18  Nixon_: the section "how do i hide controls" :)
19:19  Nixon_: first example from there will do what you want

20:02  Nixon_: funny thing that it even installs command binaries. It refuses to install only bundles
