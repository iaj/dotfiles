20:34 --- simplicity-- is now known as simplicity-
20:43  tgunr: I just noticed a problem when my user-interface is in a certain state. I have a table view with two columns both of which the user can enter data that is to be used later. There's also a button which acts upon the contents of the table view. The problem is if the user has entered new data in the column but has not yet exited the field and the button is pressed the old value is used not the current value sitting in the field. What is the best way to handle t
20:43  tgunr: his?
20:44  tgunr:  basically, in the button code I need to tell the field to complete itself but I can't see a method to do that.
21:17  bavarious: tgunr: how about making the button the first responder? it should ask the text field cell to resign being first responder, which in turn should end the editing of the cell
21:18  tgunr: hmm, ok looking that up?
21:19  bavarious: in the action method of your button, [[self window] makeFirstResponder:self];
21:19  bavarious: hmm, make that second self the reference to your button
21:19  bavarious: [[self window] makeFirstResponder:theButton];
21:20  tgunr: cc
22:58  tgunr: bavarious:  it turns out that all I had to do was determine if a row was selected and if so deselected. This would force the new entry.
