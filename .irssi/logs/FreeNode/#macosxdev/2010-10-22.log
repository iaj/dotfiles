01:36  diffract|: how hard would it be make inkscape run natively on mac osx?
01:37  jweinberg: doesn't that rely on GTK?
01:43  diffract|: jweinberg: yes
01:43  jweinberg: I seem to remember something about a native version of GTK
01:43  diffract|: as far as i know, gtk has a "native" version now http://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX
01:43  MariusAZ: eww
01:44  MariusAZ: Just create a new native GUI
01:44  diffract|: well, inkscape relies on gtk a lot
01:44  diffract|: it would be difficult
01:45  diffract|: it's still worth it to run it natively.. i don't think there is a good free alternative for vector graphics stuff

20:10  knoopx: hi
20:11  knoopx: i'm trying to create a modal login window for my app but i fail to understand why it's not positioned like a NSAlert one
20:13  knoopx: this is what i'm getting http://cl.ly/7b8406795090622125ee
20:13  knoopx: i'm using macruby/hotcocoa and manually creating the windows without IB
20:13  knoopx: i guess i'm missing some window style or misc attribute
20:14  knoopx: or do i need to manually locate the modal sheet?
20:14 @Beelsebob: knoopx: wow, that's some UI layout fail
20:14 @Beelsebob: knoopx: why the login window though?
20:14 @Beelsebob: the user's already logged into the mac
20:14  knoopx: hehe i know it's just a prototype
20:15  knoopx: i'm writting a gui client for the aria2c xml-rpc server
20:15 @Beelsebob: and the correct way to do something modally in OS X is to use a sheet
20:15  knoopx: so you need to first loging into the server :)
20:15 @Beelsebob: and make it document modal
20:15 @Beelsebob: rather than application modal
20:15 @Beelsebob: (ofc, if there's only one document the two mean the same thing)
20:16  knoopx: document modal == NSApp.beginSheet ?
