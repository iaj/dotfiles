17:03  earthnail: hey guys
17:03  earthnail: I'm trying to install libusb as I need an usb.h file
17:04  earthnail: sudo port install libusb-devel fails to compile, however
17:04  earthnail: I did a quick spotlight search and found plenty of "usb.h" files on my mac
17:04  earthnail: I just don't know how to include them - #include <usb.h> doesn't work
17:04  earthnail: btw., I'm on c++
18:16  snoy_ms: hey all. Just a simple question i hope.  I saw this "darwInRect" Method when using NSString. Where is this Method defined?
18:19 @Beelsebob: snoy_ms: NSString(AppKitAdditions)
18:21  snoy_ms: ahh, ok. I found it here "NSString Application Kit Additions Reference". But what is that?
18:21  snoy_ms: ok i get it
18:24  snoy_ms: mhh, i don't get it. Where do i find such infos? How do i know that this exists when reading the NSString doc's ?
18:40  snoy_ms: But thanks so far!
18:43  snoy_ms: I try to do my first test with a Cutom NSView and simple drawing of text. Whats the best way to do it like this here: http://media.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/products/110615/mindnode.jpg
18:43  snoy_ms: i mean the node text with rounded borders
18:44  snoy_ms: NSString drawinRect, NSTextField or any other way ?
18:45  snoy_ms: just need an advice for that, the text should be editable
18:49  snoy_ms: anyone ? Would be realy cool
19:10  snoy_ms: afk
20:31  tgunr_: ok, going nuts here, I have a NSMatrix with 2 NSButtonCells (a radio button set) the matrix and buttons are instaniated (as I see them in the debugger) but for the life of me I cannot get the state of the buttons to change, that is, calling [buttoncell with objectValue] for example always returns true. Am I missing something here?

20:43  Zorg: tgunr_: objectValue is not the state? try using -state?
20:43  tgunr_: same result, always the same
20:45  tgunr_: value is always 0x01 using state
20:46  tgunr_: always <CFBoolean 0xa0382800 [0xa0381ec0]>{value = true} using objectValue
20:47  Zorg: is buttoncell an outlet?
20:47  Zorg: just wondering
20:49  tgunr_: yes, i have IBOutlet NSButtonCell *appleMailButton tied to the cell in IB and it is instantiated when I get to the click method
20:55  Psy: tgunr_: show code ?

21:15  Psy: your problem is that you don't know which cell is being clicked ?
21:16 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 86 seconds
21:16  tgunr_: no, i just need the state of the one button, is it on or off
21:17  tgunr_: that is what the click method is trying to determine when the matrix is clicked
21:21  Psy: check your tags
21:23  tgunr_: i just check, they are 0, 1, & 2 , calling 	id theCell = [sender cellWithTag:1]; retuns correct cell and 	id theCell = [sender cellWithTag:2]; returns the other one
21:24  Psy: tgunr_: given that these are radio buttons you should suppose that the selected cell is the cell that was clicked
21:24  Psy: if(selCell == appleMailButton)
21:24  tgunr_: and not worry about the state
21:24  Psy: yep
21:25  Psy: because the state of the cell is 1 for both the old and new selected cells
21:25  tgunr_: yes, that will work Psy, my brain was focused on the button not the matrix
21:26  Psy: lol
21:29  jeremyw: Hello all.
21:31  jeremyw: I'm trying to create an NSToolbar like that in iCal, but without the 'Today' button on the left.  My attempts to center the segmented control in IB have failed since I can't set the x/y or minSize/maxSize of the space item.
21:31  jeremyw: How might one go about doing this?
21:33  jeremyw: I tried to set the min/max size of the NSToolbarItem in awakeFromNib.  If that's the suggested approach, I guess I just must be doing it wrong.  Any advice/help would be appreciated.
21:33  Psy: make an NSToolbar and put views in your toolbar items
21:34  jeremyw: I've done this in IB.  Is that not the same you speak of?
21:34  Psy: use two resizable items
21:34  jeremyw: I created an NSToolbar and then I customized the toolbar to have the proper NSToolbarItems in the right places.  I just can't set the size of the far left NSToolbarItem to offset the size of the search on the far right.
21:35  jeremyw: Hm...let me try to understand what you're suggesting.

21:46  Zorg: curious, what if you hit the radio button a second time when it's already selected, wonder if that does anything
21:47  jeremyw: Psy: When you talk about adding two resizable items, what are you meaning?  Did you mean two flexible items?
21:47  Psy: yeah
21:47 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 88 seconds
21:48  tgunr: hmm, let me try that
21:48  Psy: tgunr: that's weird... Are you sure you've made the matrix correctly ?
21:49  tgunr: want to peek on screen share? I'm pretty sure I have it right
21:49  Psy: yeah why not
21:49  tgunr: davec@mac.com
21:54  jeremyw: Psy: I'm getting the same results.
21:58  snoy_ms: Beginner question: What do i have to use when doing something like this (i just mean the text) http://media.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/products/110615/mindnode.jpg
21:58  snoy_ms: I use a custom nsview and draw. What do i need for text
21:58  snoy_ms: just NSString, NSTextfield or something else ?
22:00  jeremyw: Psy: One thing I can do, tell me if you think it's sane, is have the SearchField width be divisible by 32 and put the proper number of space items on the left.  Tested it and it works.  So if the SearchField was 96 wide, I'd have 3 space items on the left.
22:00  jeremyw: It works...
22:01  jeremyw: Feels dirty but, well, it works.  :)
22:06  snoy_ms: i need to know the recommended way to add some text on a custom view.
22:07  Psy: snoy_ms: you can either draw the text manually or use NSTextField
22:07  Psy: jeremyw: hrm
22:08  snoy_ms: Psy: with draw you mean a "drawAtPoint"?
22:09  Psy: yes
22:12  jeremyw: Psy: Well, I saw that when I added more flex items to the left of my segmented control, it would push right but it never centered really, especially when resizing.
22:12  tgunr: PsyM it is working now, I deleted the old matrix and made a new one (the same as before) and now get the different selections
22:13  snoy_ms: Psy: I think i use a NSTextField to add it as Subview.
22:13  snoy_ms: Psy: i hope its the correct way to build (for example) a graph with textfields
22:14  Psy: snoy_ms: doesn't change much, you could subclass NSView to draw the text manually...
22:14  tgunr: moral of the story: When all else fails, rebuild your interface I guess
22:14  Psy: tgunr: XD
22:15  Psy: snoy_ms: 2 good reasons to add the fields instead of drawing: drawing is managed by NSTextField and if you need to do text edition it's already there
22:16  tgunr: Also, the state is changing as I would have thought
22:16  snoy_ms: Psy: yes, should be editable. :-)
22:16  snoy_ms: Sounds good
22:16  Psy: then NSTextField is better
22:16  tgunr: Merci
22:16  Psy: de rien
22:28  jeremyw: Psy: I think I'll stick with this for now.  I don't mind the hard requirement on the SearchField's view having a width that is a multiple of 32 and having the proper number of fixed width spacers to offset its size.
22:32  jeremyw: Now if there is a better way, and you have time, I love to learn.
