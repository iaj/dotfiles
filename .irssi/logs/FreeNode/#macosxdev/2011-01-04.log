18:14  tobylane: o these sort of errors mean anything to anyone? error: 'PFNGLFRAMEBUFFERTEXTURE2DEXTPROC' does not name a type
18:14 @Beelsebob: tobylane: that would be to do with that not being a type
18:15 @Beelsebob: what doc gives you the impression that it should be?
18:15  tobylane: nothing, its just an error that has come out of building something that used to build
18:15  tobylane: its not new code, its sdl or wxw i think
18:16 @Beelsebob: ...
18:16 @Beelsebob: you don't even know what you're trying to build?
18:16 @Beelsebob: o.O
18:17  tobylane: i mean that it isnt a problem in the code im building, but in one of the dependancies
18:19 @Beelsebob: submit a bug report then
18:19 @Beelsebob: and for things like that, use MacPorts/fink/that other one Axman6 likes
18:19  tobylane: homebrew?
18:20 @Beelsebob: that's the one
19:53  jarek: hi!
19:53  jarek: will it be possible to sell Web Apps on Mac App Store?
19:54  jarek: by Web App I mean standalone HTML5/JaveScript/CSS code run inside webkit
20:30 * dennda also seconds the suggestion to use homebrew

21:06  cnfer: Beelsebob: i like homebrew too
21:08 @Beelsebob: cnfer: yeh, from the looks of it, it's good
21:08 @Beelsebob: but I just haven't got round to playing yet
21:09  cnfer: uhu

21:46  Michaelson_: how could i close System Preferences programmatically?
21:48  Zorg: command-W
21:48  Zorg: >_>
21:50  Zorg: kill(system_preferences_pid, SIGKILL)
21:50  Zorg: tell application "System Preferences"
21:50  Zorg: quit
21:50  Zorg: end tell
21:59  Michaelson_: Zorg i mean from within custom preference pane
21:59  Michaelson_: applescript seems to be the right solution, although a little bit difficult
22:00  Michaelson_: killing the process i guess it's quite impossible as long as i have no idea what pid does this process have
22:00  Michaelson_: i was wondering if i could send some kind of AppleEvent, or, maybe, it has some kind of API for closing it
