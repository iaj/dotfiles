16:08  MobGod: can someone tell me how I can find out if I have packages for tcl ??
16:08  MobGod: I want to install a eggdrop
16:09 @Beelsebob: MobGod: OpenSSL is part of the default OS X install
16:10  MobGod: Beelsebob so I should have no problem compiling ?
16:10 @Beelsebob: I have no idea what eggdrop is or what it's requirements are
16:11 @Beelsebob: the documentation for it does say it's designed to work on OS X though
16:11 @Beelsebob: so you shouldn't have a problem if you RTFM
16:11  MobGod: lol I haven't seen that in a long time RTFM
16:12  MobGod: but I get it now thanks Beelsebob
16:12  MobGod: :)

22:41  tqbf: I have a table view, working fine, bound to an NSArrayController; I have a custom NSObject that wants to use KVO to watch the table/arraycontroller's selection so it can update a different piece of UI
22:42 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 131 seconds
22:42  tqbf: I use [arrayController addObserver:self keyPath:@"selection" (etc)]
22:42  tqbf: i get one observer event when the program starts
22:42  tqbf: but click around in the table and I never get another one. How do you watch the selection of a table bound to an array controller?
23:00  tqbf: @"selectionIndexes" also firing one KVO event
23:00  lambdabot: Unknown command, try @list

23:39  irchs: Hello everyone
23:39  irchs: I am creating a system preferences
23:39  irchs: preference pane rather
23:40  irchs: I want it to run a "command line tool" every hour, so I am making a launchd plist
23:40  irchs: I have built all of the various components, now the install process is bothersome
23:40  irchs: My questions are
23:40  irchs: :
23:41  irchs: Should the "command line tool" be stored in my prefpane bundle, should I executed it from there using launchd?
23:42  irchs: Is there a way of forcing a pref pane to install system wide?
23:42  irchs: i.e. when you double click on it, it only installs system wide?
23:46  irchs: Anyone with any experience with building pref panes?
