00:38  nano-: FindNextComponent removes blocking of SIGPIPE, anyone else noticed that?
00:38  nano-: http://b65bd425da705a77.paste.se/ that function
00:39  nano-: Luckly I found the AudioComponentFindNext that seems to replace the use of that one, but still horrible. I'll just ditching support for older OS X-es unless someone here has a suggestion to circumvent that.
00:40  bavarious: that's odd
00:42  nano-: Yes, very. I nailed it down so that if I commented out that line, SIGPIPE was blocked, and adding it again, SIGPIPE crashed my program.
00:45  bavarious: have you tried making a simple program whose only code is to block SIGPIPE and then call FindNextComponent()?
00:45  bavarious: this could be a symptom of something else
00:50  nano-: http://b032cc47de085be3.paste.se/
00:51  nano-: on 10.6.2 or whatever is latest that does not block SIGPIPE
00:51  nano-: Removing fuck_the_pipe() causes it to block SIGPIPE again.
00:52  nano-: Nice easter egg dear Steve has put in there :]
00:53  bavarious: yeah, it looks like a bug
00:54  bavarious: a rather weird bug
00:54  bavarious: have you filed a report yet?
00:55  nano-: Nopes.
00:55  nano-: I have no idea where to file it.
00:55  bavarious: http://bugreport.apple.com
00:56  bavarious: and you feel like sharing with the community since apple doesn't publish bug reports, http://openradar.appspot.com
00:57  bavarious: s/and you/and if you/
01:08  nano-: yeah.. filed a bug.
01:11  nano-: http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=726401
01:27  nano-: Actually.. using AudioComponentFindNext instead does not help. I must have used the null output plugin when I tried that.. stupid me. Ok.. so it's till completly borken :/

01:43  LordDragon: and here i am! :D
01:43 * LordDragon pokes Axman6 
01:43  Axman6: 'lo
01:44  LordDragon: ok, teach me how to make my own irc client pls :D
01:44  LordDragon: kidding kidding
01:44  Axman6: you see, people don't ask stupid questions like that
01:45  LordDragon: but seriously, i do want to learn to a level that i CAN make one someday
01:45  Axman6: do you know C?
01:45  nano-: LordDragon: Start with some high level language like python. It's easy to get started with, and versatile.
01:46  LordDragon: Axman6, thats my biggest problem. im pretty good at C. but once we get into object oriented stuff like classes, etc, my brain stops working
01:46  Psy: stupid recommendation :s
01:46  nano-: Once you've grasped one language, moving to the next is fairly quick.
01:47  Axman6: i think i'd unjoy Obj-C if it were well typed
01:47  Axman6: there was always this feeling of 'uh... do i actually know what this object can do? is it really what i think it is?'
01:47  Psy: unjoy ?
01:48  LordDragon: i actually used to code in C for a company. but it was all low level stuff like microcontrollers. that stuff makes sense. but the objective oriented stuff seems foreign to me
01:48  Axman6: enjoy*
01:48  Axman6: at the moment i unjoy Obj-C ;)
01:48  Psy: Axman6: http://paste.lisp.org/display/114703#5 :P
01:49  Axman6: is this your language?
01:49  Psy: yes
01:49  LordDragon: ah good example Psy. thats another thing. the syntax is also confusing to me in Obj-C :( it looks so strange compared to straight C
01:50  Psy: LordDragon: it's not ObjC
01:50  LordDragon: haha oh ok. Psy that explains that then
01:50  Psy: XD
01:50  Axman6: Psy: what changes do you have from Obj-C?
01:50  LordDragon: does Obj-C have class constructors and deconstructors like in C++ ?
01:51  Psy: LordDragon: no
01:51  LordDragon: ah ok
01:51  Psy: "construction" is in two explicit step: allocation and initializations
01:52  LordDragon: is that NSAlloc ?
01:52  Psy: and init methods all start with init and are regular instance methods
01:52  Psy: NSAllocateObject ? no
01:52  LordDragon: oh ok
01:52  Psy: [[MyClass alloc] init];
01:52  LordDragon: hm
01:52  Psy: Axman6: better typing system, message syntax used throughout the language, some nice features of SmallTalk reinjected into it :D
01:53  bavarious: i'm a recent convert to [MyClass new] goodness
01:53  Psy: removed boundaries of C :D
01:53  Axman6: Psy: better typing how?
01:54  Axman6: i also find the whole key value coding thing completely fucked
01:54  nano-: The lack of type inferencing is a joke.
01:54  Psy: more strict, with "templates" as well, but in the end the typing is more a helper for the compiler and the user
01:55  Psy: KVC ? Are you sure ?
01:55  Axman6: isn't KVC where you use strings to specify where you want to send messages?
01:55  Axman6: among other things
01:56  Psy: uh it's more like working with any object like they were dictionaries
01:59  Psy: Axman6: anyway what do you think about closure syntax and before/after stuff ?
02:00  Axman6: example of closure syntax?
02:00  Psy: the #5
02:01  Axman6: where should i be looking in it?
02:01  Psy: http://paste.lisp.org/display/114703#5
02:01  Psy: line 22 to 33 for the block literal
02:02  Axman6: ok
02:02  Psy: 36 for partial block
02:02  Psy: 49 for another partial block
02:02  Psy: and calls are line 40, 46 and 52-53
02:02  Axman6: argh, what kind of crappy paste site doesn't have line numbers >_<
02:02  Psy: scroll at the bottom
02:03  Axman6: ah ha!
02:04  Axman6: ah nice, i like the closure stuff :)
02:04  Psy: message-driven :P
02:04  Axman6: hmm, or maybe i don't quite get it, like i thought i did
02:05 * Axman6 wonders why MyBlueView is given the colour redColor
02:05  Psy: in a way you create a variable that has one valid selector which is the closure implementation
02:05  Psy: lolz
02:05  Psy: indeed it's weird
