07:59  tgunr: Just got my rejection notice from the AS because I forgot to take the word Sparkle out of my About box. Even though the code does not have the Framework in the bundle. Better watch those dots on top of the i's

08:25  Axman6: AS?
08:35  tgunr: AppStore
08:37  TzilTzal: is there a way to configure homebrew to use -j when calling make?
08:39  tgunr: I give, what's homebrew? Whiskey or Beer?
08:45  tgunr: you might try `./configure -help' and see if an option exists
09:16  TzilTzal: there doesn't seem to be a clang brew formula :(

12:09  tgunr: I think I found a problem with NSNotFound in x86_64 mode
12:17  tgunr: I have this while loop 		while (index != NSNotFound) { ..... 			index = [selIndexes indexGreaterThanIndex:index]; and it is looping forever, in gdb I see index = 0xffffffff
12:19  tgunr: so either NSNotFound has the wrong value or the return from indexGreaterThanIndex is wrong
12:30  tgunr: hmm, in i386 mode the call returns 0x7fffffff and loop terminates as expected
12:48  tgunr: found the problem :) unsigned != NSUinteger
