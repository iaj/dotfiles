23:21  etyrnal: Automator question:  why, in automator, does this command "for f in "$@"
23:21  etyrnal: do
23:21  etyrnal: 	#echo "$f"
23:21  etyrnal: lame -a  --vbr-new -b 32 --resample 12 $f
23:21  etyrnal: done" only produce the first 18 seconds of output, seemingly hanging, yet when i do the exact same thing from the CLI, it runs thru to completion with no problem  ?
23:21  etyrnal: is this a lame problem, or an automator problem?
