18:33  tomday: Are there any tutorials on how to create an app to collect user input and connect to a remote mysql server to store the inputted data?
18:34  tomday: (I'm new at x-code and obj-c)
18:36  Axman6: well there's plenty of docs that you can use to figure out how to get user input, and i'm sure mysql has an API that has lots of documentation
18:37  Bavarious: tomday: the currency converter tutorial is a good place to start
18:37  tomday: Cool, where do I find that at?
18:38  Bavarious: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/
18:39  tomday: Oh sweet, cool!  I'll read up!  Thanks man.
18:39  Axman6: also time to learn your way around the apple developer docs ;)
18:41  tomday: Def!  wow, goldmine of info here!
18:41  Axman6: uh, yeah ;)
18:43  Bavarious: tomday: since you're new to Mac OS development, be sure to read those top four documents listed on http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/navigation/
18:43  Bavarious: (one of them is the currency converter tutorial btw)
18:43  tomday: For sure!
18:43  tomday: Thanks!
19:31  hdek: Can anyone recommend a good "Time Tracking and Invoicing" app for the Mac that also has an iPhone/iPad companion?
19:32  Bavarious: hdek: if no one answers here, try asking on #MacOSX or #iphonedev
19:32  hdek: @ Bavarious - Thanks a bunch
