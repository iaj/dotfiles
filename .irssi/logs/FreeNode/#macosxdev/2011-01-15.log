12:13  Hannofcart: Why is it that the reference for some classes like NSOutlineView clearly list the methods that its delegate [can optionally/should] implement while others like those for NSTabView do not list them clearly? Is there a particular way to look at the reference?
12:15 @Beelsebob: Hannofcart: because cocoa is lame compared to cocoa touch and used informal protocols a lot
12:15 @Beelsebob: hopefully as newer versions come out they'll shift to formal ones more
12:15 @Beelsebob: in the mean timeâ€¦ the docs for NSTabViewDelegate *are* there
12:15 @Beelsebob: and it *is* a formal protocol
12:15 @Beelsebob: search better :P
12:17  Hannofcart: ah... so all I need to access the documentation of an NSClass is to search for NSClassDelegate.... now I understand! Thanks Beelsebob
12:18 @Beelsebob: Hannofcart: no, all you need to acces the documentation for NSProtocol is to search for NSProtocol
12:18 @Beelsebob: ;)
12:18 @Beelsebob: the class documentation's job is to tell you that the delegate subscribes to that protocol
12:20  Hannofcart: hm... so I look at the class documentation, find which protocol it subscribes to and look in the respective protocol's documentation. Correct? And this is consistently across all documentation?
12:20 @Beelsebob: it is across all delegates which use a formal protocol, yes
12:20  Hannofcart: thanks.
12:20 @Beelsebob: in general though you can guess the protocol name
12:20 @Beelsebob: it'll be NSClassDelegate
12:20  Hannofcart: understood.
12:20 @Beelsebob: and for data sources it'll be NSClassDataSource
12:21  Hannofcart: got it. thanks again.

13:56  ayilm1: hi there. Is there a way to open a launched but hidden app directly from the menulet icon?
13:56  Psy: directly ?
13:57  ayilm1: yes so when opened. have a menulet icon up the top. but when hidden (or command +w), clicking the icon opens the window again
13:57  ayilm1: so no drop downs or anything
13:58  ayilm1: kind of like the istat menus app
13:58  Psy: well you do whatever you want with your status bar
14:02  ayilm1_: sorry. internet is flaky here
14:03  ayilm1_: so is there a way I can achieve this?
14:04  Psy: well you do whatever you want with your status bar
14:04  ayilm1_: ok so far, im creating the menulet using nsstatus item
14:05  Psy: duh
14:05  ayilm1_: which is working fine. the icon and menus are coming up
14:05  Psy: and stop calling it a menulet it looks like java :s
14:05  ayilm1_: haha ok
14:06  ayilm1_: what should I call it?
14:06  ayilm1_: menu item?
14:06  Psy: yes
14:06  ayilm1_: ok but I'm just wondering if i can eliminate the drop down and just have the icon there to open the hidden window
14:06  Psy: setAction: + setTarget: on your menu item and you're done
14:08  ayilm1_: got it! cheers mate
