01:34  mgeary: hi folks
01:34  mgeary: i have ~50 PDF files that i need to run through a Quartz filter, and while i could use Automator, i'd prefer something that ran on the command line... Is there anything built-in or otherwise available that fits that description?
01:36  mgeary: found one: http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/coreimagetool/
01:43  mgeary: bah, but that won't open PDFs
01:43  mgeary: maybe http://github.com/fjoachim/pdfkittool...
01:57  jweinberg: mgeary, you should be able to use automater from AppleScript
01:57  jweinberg: which you can run from the CLI :P
01:57  mgeary: looks like PDFKitTool will do what i want
01:57  mgeary: but thanks for responding
02:18  jkyle: what is the proper way to respond to window resizing events in your nswindowcontroller class?

22:28  Fah: generic routing encapsulation
22:29  Fah: it's trivial to do on linux, and I'm sure that bsd can do it too
22:29  Fah: i just dont know how off hand.
22:32  Fah: and i just figured it out. You can do it all via ifconfig, I think. I'll test it later.
22:32  Fah: Under linux, you can use the 'ip' command and it accomplishes the same thing. Think of GRE as IP over IP
22:32  Fah: or ipsec with no sec :)
