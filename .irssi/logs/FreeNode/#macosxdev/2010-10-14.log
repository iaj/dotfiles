00:26  BlackBishop: hey guys...
00:27  BlackBishop: what's the latest xcode that would work with a powerpc mac ?

07:00  Karith: Can someone make a case for why I shouldn't refuse to allow code to use the option of _setjmp/_longjmp?
07:01  jweinberg: coroutines?
07:01 * Karith is looking at lua here, and while it's a very nice thing, small, fast, light, and generally nifty...  setjmp/longjmp make my skin crawl.
07:02  jweinberg: it has its place
07:03  Karith: the lua interpreter, for example?  :D
07:03  jweinberg: yup :)
07:08  Karith: it seems to be used for handling lua's coroutines.
07:08  jweinberg: its a very common use of setjmp/longjmp
07:08  jweinberg: about the only 'real' use i've ever seen for it
07:09  Karith: Signal handlers
07:09  jweinberg: true
07:09  Karith: But with those you've truly gotta CYA
07:11  Karith: call your setjmp, register your signal handler, and be sure to de-register your signal handler before the calling function goes out of scope (including main!)
07:15  Karith: you could implement a really crazy-ass stack-based exception handler with setjmp/longjmp  ;)
07:15  Karith: how's that for sick?  ;)
07:16  jweinberg: hah
07:17  Karith: I have in mind how you could do try and except easily enough..  finally seems to need a little work.

12:12  Karith: jweinberg: I was wrong.  :|  Lua doesn't use setjmp/longjmp for coroutines.  It actually implements an exception handler in C with it.  It does not use a stack for env's, it uses a list...

17:55  tgunr: To all interested parties, I now have Sparkle 1.5 working, the problem turn out to be the DSA keys generated by the new Sparkle 1.5 ruby script are too long. Reducing the size to 1024 along with the changes posted by amw on github now permit the signature to verify.

18:31  tgunr: if I shorten the key it works, if i use 2048 it don't all other settings being the same
18:31  bavarious: sparkle was linked to /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib whilst /usr/bin/openssl is linked to /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.8.dylib
18:32  tgunr: maybe thts where I saw the .097
18:32 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 90 seconds
18:34  tgunr: and the sources at Apple are .096
18:34  bavarious: pfff
18:34  tgunr: http://opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-1064/
18:35  bavarious: yeah, i saw that
18:35  tgunr: beats me what is going on, i don't have the time to find root cause, it now works for me
18:36  tgunr: wierd, wierd
18:36  bavarious: well, it's good to know you're not alone and maybe the other guy has the time to chase this with andy
18:37  tgunr: yeah, i left some comments on github
18:37  bavarious: when you generated your dsa key pair, did you have another openssl installation reachable by PATH
18:37  bavarious: ?
18:37  tgunr: checking
18:37  bavarious: that'd be used instead of stock's
18:38  bavarious: andy's script doesn't specify a path to openssl so it'll use the first one according to PATH
