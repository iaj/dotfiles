11:43  earthnail: where do I find the C++ itoa() function on mac os? It's not in stdlib.h
13:41  foofoobar: Hi
13:43  foofoobar: Maybe it's not the best idead to ask this question in a mac os x dev channel, but I dont know where a better palce would be. Currently I have experience in ajva and objective-c (with cocoa). In my study we are programming with java.
13:43  foofoobar: I'm tryining now to decide which way I should go and which language I should dive in more: java or objective-c with cocoa
13:44  foofoobar: I prefer the objective-c style and the cocoa frameworks, but I dont like that it is bound to mac os x/iOS
13:45  foofoobar: Maybe someone of you can point me in the right direction
14:01  Bynbo7: foofoobar: it is not bound to OS X, you can use GNUStep on other OS's
14:02  Bynbo7: Cocoa is of course bound to OS X
14:03  foofoobar: Bynbo7, and theoretically, what would be the best direction? Go learn obj-c with cocoa or go on with java?
14:03  Bynbo7: what do you want to do in the future?
14:07  foofoobar: Bynbo7, developing software. From desktop software to web software to mobile software.. I'm currently doing my web software via python. now I'm thinkinf of the desktop/mobile software.. java for all os + android or objc- with coca for mac os x + iOS
14:08  Bynbo7: yeah i can't help you, you
14:08  Bynbo7: you've already fallen in love with the dark side
14:10  foofoobar: haha
14:10  foofoobar: and what is the dark side?
14:10  cnf: java
14:10  cnf: i avoid java desktop apps like the plague
14:11  foofoobar: cnf, why??
14:11  cnf: because they all suck
14:11  foofoobar: cnf, why?
14:11  cnf: every single one i have tried over the past 10+ years, on any platform sucks
14:11  cnf: they are ugly, clumsy, most all are dog slow
14:11  foofoobar: You are right, but not all
14:11  cnf: every
14:11  cnf: single
14:11  cnf: one
14:12  cnf: i have tried over the past many many years
14:12  foofoobar: cnf, so which programing language do you prefer for multi-platform applications?
14:12  foofoobar: *multi-platform gui applications
14:12  cnf: no such thing
14:12  cnf: C
14:12  cnf: and recode all the GUI stuff per platform
14:13  foofoobar: but this is very time-consuming
14:13  cnf: yes, writing good apps is time-consuming
14:16  cnf: foofoobar: basically, you want to dev for mac users? learn obj-c and cocoa
14:16  cnf: because we are picky, and don't go for sloppy software
14:17  cnf: we WILL pay for good software, though
14:17  foofoobar: cnf and if I decide to dev for mobile phones? should I def for android or for iOS ? I mean .. android is growing more than iOS
14:17  cnf: is it?
14:17  cnf: are you sure?
14:17  foofoobar: No
14:17  cnf: exactly
14:17  foofoobar: I remember an article that it is
14:18  cnf: i'm not convinced
14:18  foofoobar: http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/03/quantcast-android-continues-to-grow-vs-ios-domination/
14:18  cnf: do you want to make free software?
14:19  foofoobar: mh no
14:19  cnf: iTMS store vs android store
14:19  cnf: you pick
14:19  cnf: also, Android OS has jumped from 21% to 25% and at the same time, Apple's (http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL) iOS has dropped from 58% of mobile browsing to 56%
14:20  cnf: and that is US only
14:20  foofoobar: yes
14:21  foofoobar: but this shows that iOS is not growing any more.. android is
14:21  cnf: oh, really?
14:21  foofoobar: I think it's only a matter of time until the are eval, not?
14:21  cnf: i doubt it
14:22  foofoobar: mhh
14:22  foofoobar: Dou you develop professionaly in obj-c ?
14:22  cnf: no
14:22  foofoobar: Does it worth to do it?
14:23  floogy: Is it OT to ask a question regarding access issues from osx (sl) to freenas 7.3 through  afp?
14:24  floogy: I'm not getting answers in #freenas nor in #macosx or #osx-server
14:24  floogy: neither in #afp548
14:25  floogy: I got the error msg and the daemon.log of the freeBSD (freeNAS).
14:26  floogy: Where can I find the appropriate place to ask those questions?
14:27  floogy: I got an afp connection error from macosx to freenas (freeebsd 7.3) (german) http://paste.pocoo.org/show/308278/
15:50  jeremyw: So yesterday I asked about an NSPopupButton.  It's type is pull down, NSRecessedBezelStyle bezel and setShowsBorderOnlyWhileMouseInside is YES.  Why might the dropdown arrows be centered in the button with the text overlapping it?
16:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#macosxdev +o Beelsebob]
16:32  jeremyw: So the NSPopUpButton in the top right corner of iCall displayes like it's a popup but when clicked presents its popup menu like it's a dropdown.  Am I completely insane?
18:49  jeremyw: The fix: NSViewMaxXMargin -> NSViewMinXMargin
