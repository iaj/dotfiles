21:09  bavarious: i'm really confused
21:09  Kryptaesthesie: the table on panel B has the information how to print / design the content of table on panel A :-)
21:10 --- Channel #macosxdev was synced in 69 seconds
21:10  bavarious: does this table in panel B have a list of print options?
21:11  Kryptaesthesie: maybe it's easier on the code-side ...
21:11  Kryptaesthesie: ATableController has a propertie "NSMutableArray* patterns", which holds the needed information ...
21:11  Kryptaesthesie: in my BTableController.m I want access to that array
21:11  bavarious: hmm
21:11  Kryptaesthesie: what does print options mean?
21:12  bavarious: print options == how to print / design the content of table on panel A
21:12  bavarious: i'm assuming that's what patterns contains
21:12  Kryptaesthesie: you're right
21:13  bavarious: is it the case that you only need the *currently selected rows* in B's table and you want to show it in A?
21:14  bavarious: s/show it/show them/
21:15  Kryptaesthesie: the state of the table on panel B isn't relevant. I realy need the whole content of that NSMutableArray.
21:15  Kryptaesthesie: ... in the Controller of panel A
21:17  bavarious: so you need 'patterns' in both A and B. how about creating two array controllers, both of them bound to 'patterns'?
21:17  bavarious: NSMutableArray *patterns would exist (as an attribute) only in one class
21:18  Kryptaesthesie: and there is no way to share on the code side?
21:19  bavarious: you can create outlets to the array controllers
21:19  bavarious: and, given an array controller, you can access its underlying NSArray
21:22  Kryptaesthesie: so, you mean I should create a new Array Controller and bind my Outlet -> Content to My Controller class of panel B and Bindings -> Content Array to the property of the controller class of panel A?
21:33  bavarious: back
21:33  bavarious: i think you can bind an NSArrayController to another NSArrayController (content object, i think)
21:39  Kryptaesthesie: the binding works, and I created the property 'patterns' in my controller class A.
21:39  Kryptaesthesie: But how do I bind the property with the new created Array Controller in Interface Builder?
21:48  Kryptaesthesie: hm, I hate the disconnect after 24h, bavarious
21:48  Kryptaesthesie: did you write something after "i think you can bind an NSArrayController to another NSArrayController (content object, i think)"?
21:54  jkyle: what could cause an nsview to ignore increases (not decreases) in height whose parent has autoresizeSubviews == True and resize mask = (NSViewWidthSizable | NSViewHeightSizable)
21:55  Kryptaesthesie: I've to go now, but I think you helped me a log, bavarious :-) Thank you!
