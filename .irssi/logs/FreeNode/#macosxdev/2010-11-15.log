03:29  Zorg1: 'lo. so, basically, uh. I'm fork()'ing a child and in the child, I run execvp to replace the process image, and I'm ignoring SIGINT in the parent, and I also want to ignore SIGINT in the child, but I'm not sure how. any ideas? (not incredibly os x related, so this may be a stretch of a question).
03:46  Axman6: interesting question, it might not be possible
03:49  Zorg1: well, basically the issue is that if I do something like control-C  in the parent, I don't want the child to execute.
03:50  Zorg1: don't want the child to terminate*
