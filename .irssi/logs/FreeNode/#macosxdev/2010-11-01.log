21:57  jkyle: I'm writing a media player. for slide shows, movies, music, type media. My player interface for play, pause, etc.  should remain responsive while I update the view.
21:57  jkyle: I'm assuming I'll need to use cocoa threads for this?
21:58  Psy: to update the interface ?
21:59  jkyle: right
21:59  Psy: no
21:59  Psy: anything interface related is done on the main thread
22:00  jkyle: so it looks similar to a vlc movie player. what it "plays" is a series of actions (show this image for x seconds, show this text for y seconds, play a movie,etc).
22:01  jkyle: so I have a viewer set up and a PlayerController. I was thinking the controller could take the selected action, build a view, and send a notification of "ViewNeedsDisplay"
22:02  jkyle: so, taking the case of an image display, I need to wait the 30s of display before continuing without hanging the gui
22:05  jkyle: Psy: any of that make sense?
22:05  Psy: a timer
22:05  jkyle: NSTimer
22:05  Psy: you put the image on the player
22:05  Psy: you setup a timer that fires after 30 seconds without repeat
22:05  jkyle: gotcha
22:05  Psy: and in the timer's method you remove the image
22:06  jkyle: right, the timer has a callback. ok, timer is perfect. I was basically on the way to creating my own timer with callback :P
22:08  jkyle: hm, 50 to 100ms timing resolution might produce a problem in the future
22:08  jkyle: but I'll worry about that in the future
23:36  jkyle: hm, looks like performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: will work well for this too
