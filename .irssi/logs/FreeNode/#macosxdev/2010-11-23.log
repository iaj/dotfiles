12:22  CapsuleZ: Hey
12:23 @Beelsebob: heya
12:23 @Beelsebob: well, that explains why your controller doesn't inherit UIViewController :P
12:23  CapsuleZ: 10:21:54 PM <CapsuleZ> I know this is going to sound really newb, but how to I setup the icon and version number etc.. ?
12:23  CapsuleZ: DW, it's running now :)
12:23 @Beelsebob: in the info.plist
12:24  CapsuleZ: What would the version number "be under"
12:25 @Beelsebob: Bundle version and Bundle versions string, short
12:26  CapsuleZ: And the icon?
12:26 @Beelsebob: Icon file
12:30 @Beelsebob: CapsuleZ: http://pastebin.com/7t8HgyKt <â€” this is what I'd expect to see in that file
12:30  CapsuleZ: I mean how do i include it, just have the full path to it?
12:30 @Beelsebob: the easiest way is just to edit in the GUI editor in target settings
13:20  Capsule: Hey, Beelsebob :)
13:20 @Beelsebob: hey
13:20  Capsule: Quick question.
13:24 @Beelsebob: that wasn't a question
13:32  Capsule: How do i add "idle" and "pressed" background images to a "square" button ?
