18:08  bavarious: johnlocke: isn't there an event flag mask for the command key?
18:09  bavarious: other than that, i don't see any obvious errors in your code
18:09  bavarious: ah, there is one indeed: kCGEventFlagMaskCommand
18:10  bavarious: try CGEventSetFlags() with the mask above on your key down event
18:10  bavarious: above mask*
18:11  n1mda: I'm quite new to this, which key down event? Do you mean that I should call CGEventSetFlags(kCGEventFlagMaskCommand); before CGEventPostToPSN?
18:12  bavarious: you have a key down event for the {left,right} arrow (your code is confusing in that regard)
18:12  bavarious: before posting it, flag it with kCGEventFlagMaskCommand
18:13  bavarious: in the end you should post only two events: the command-masked key down event followed by the key up event
