05:54  wilhelmtell: hi
05:56  wilhelmtell: I have a simple application. A menu item is supposed to bring up a window. For some reason the window won't show.
05:58  wilhelmtell: I connected the menu item to an action that loads the xib of the window. in the window's controller awakeFromNib I call makeKeyOrderFront but it wob't show the window. I do see that the window is nil.
05:58  wilhelmtell: Any idea?
