02:01  clusty: weird thing: i am including a c++ header from allover the place
02:01  clusty: and it has a bunch of defines
02:01  clusty: somehow they do not go further than the header file itself
02:01  clusty: any clues why?
02:40  Psy: clusty: show code ?
02:42  clusty: http://pastie.org/1410016 buzzword is #define __CL_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS
02:43  clusty: http://pastie.org/1410021 line 53 chokes cause unless that define is there, cl.hpp does not define cl::Error
02:43  clusty: are defines like "static" ?
02:43  clusty: i need to define at compile to time to get a global behaviour ?
02:45  clusty: one more problem is: NULL is not defined :D, but 0 is clues ?
02:46  clusty: Psy: that is beep :D
02:49  Psy: #define are constrained to the files they are in
02:49  Psy: if you include a header containing a define the file will have that define on
02:51  Psy: maybe the fact that it's inside an inclusion guard makes it not work...
02:52  clusty: will compile-pass it thanks
02:52  clusty: idea why NULL is not defined ?
02:52  clusty: i need to run. thanks for help
