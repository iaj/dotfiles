06:10  Qbix1: hey everyone
06:10  Qbix1: is this different from #macdev?
06:10  Qbix1: is there a channel for safari development, by any chance?
06:11  Axman6: this channel is different from macdev in that we explicitly aim to help newbies if we can. #macdev basically seems to have a policy of not helping newbies
06:21  Qbix1: oh, that's good
06:22  Qbix1: well, if I wanted to develop for the mac, what would my toolchain be? Can you give me a comprehensive list fo a beginner?
06:22  Qbix1: XCode, MacOS sdk? what else
06:22  Axman6: not sure how well we acheive this goal, but we try
06:22  djef: xcode
06:22  Axman6: yeah, XCode for mac development
06:23  djef: and from there you have lots of other options -- many more if you aren't aiming for the mac app store.
06:23  Axman6: heh
06:32  Qbix1: what if I am aiming for the mac app store?
06:32  Qbix1: do you think I can make an app called "Calendar" for the MacOS app store?
06:34  djef: probably not

07:02  Qbix1: why not
07:09  djef: i'm guessing that apple will claim that it'll cause confusion with the built-in so-named app.
07:09  djef: oh, wait, that's iCal.
07:09  djef: ha. then maybe.
07:09  djef: if someone hasn't already nabbed the name.
07:10  Qbix1: :)

12:16  bonifatio: 120k for 2+ years obj-c ? unbelieveable
13:00  maxlo: well, it worked.
13:00  maxlo: thanks
13:01  maxlo: bonifatio: is that too  much or two low? (i am not from US, sorry)
13:02  bonifatio: maxlo:  i am not from US as well, but is the highest offer i've seen
13:03  maxlo: they say that in the US life is also expensive
13:05  bonifatio: yes but I wouldn't know that. I have never lived in new york before.
13:07  bonifatio: one thing i know is that.. i don't mind getting 120k for 2+ years obj-c work :D
13:07  maxlo: hehe, me neither
