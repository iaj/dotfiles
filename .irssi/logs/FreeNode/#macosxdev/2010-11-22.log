00:05 --- Jace_Fuse is now known as JaceFuse
01:49  clusty: anybody got time to help a poor guy lost in boost templates ?
01:59  tgunr: what's a boost template?
02:03  clusty: boost is a lib full of templates
02:03  clusty: c++ templates
02:10  Axman6: ouch
02:11  Axman6: what's so difficult about templates in C++ anyway? i must admit i've never used them (barely used any C++), but from what i saw, they looked pretty trivial... at least for what i'd use them for
02:13  clusty: Axman6: templates with partial specialization are not that easy
02:13  clusty: and plus writing code that generates efficient templates is even harder
02:23  clusty: Axman6: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Expression-template
02:23  clusty: still looks easy ?
02:28  Axman6: looks like a really gross way of doing what i do in haskell all the time
02:30  clusty: fortunately nobody uses haskell in the industry :D
02:31  clusty: i admire the power of functional programming, but that makes for scary unreadable code
02:42  Axman6: clusty: ha, i completely disagree, haskell is used in industry, i'm leaving for an internship with a financial company who excvlusively uses haskell on thursday in tokyo, many large and small banks are using it, and once you get used to haskell, it's not just readable, you think in it
02:42  Axman6: wow, this keyboard is horrible
02:43  clusty: feels like badly written functional code is 100x worse than badly written proc code
02:43  Axman6: luckily it';s veryu easy o write good functional code ;)
02:44  Axman6: that;s clear, fast and reusuable
02:44  Psy: :s
02:45  clusty: i am still scratching my head when i look at mathematica functional code i wrote 2-3 years back
02:45  clusty: and wonder, WTF does this uber smart line do again? :D
02:45  Axman6: haha, yeah, mathematica's functional code is an abomination
02:45  Axman6: they copmpletely fucked up when implementing that
02:45  clusty: i only know mathematica and SML functional progging
02:45  clusty: i hated SML
02:46  Axman6: i've not seen much SML
02:46  Axman6: @src map
02:46  lambdabot: map _ []     = []
02:46  lambdabot: map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
02:47  clusty: Axman6: still student?
02:47  Psy: stop swearing Axman6
02:47  Axman6: yeah
02:47  clusty: Axman6: presume comp sci aiming for scientific computing?
02:47  Axman6: possibly
02:48  Axman6: well, i'm going an Eng/IT combined degree, thinking i'll drop the engineering though, it's boring. and i'm quite good at the IT side
02:48  clusty: and you never studied c++ templates?
02:48  clusty: that is mighty strange...
02:49  Axman6: nope, they don't use C++ at all here
02:49  clusty: obj-c? :D
02:49  Psy: I guss it's better for your health
02:49  Axman6: haskell, C, java, Ada, asm
02:49  Psy: guess*
02:49  Psy: http://paste.lisp.org/display/115848 \o/e\o/
02:50  clusty: ada?
02:50  clusty: thought that was dead as a dodo
02:50  Axman6: Ada has the best concurrenct primitives of any language i've seen
02:50  Psy: nah still taught in french schools aparently lol
02:50  Axman6: and it was used for the concurrent systems course
02:50  Axman6: if its syntax wasn't so ugly, i'd use it more
02:50  clusty: Psy: i gave up on obj-c :D
02:50  Axman6: it's very safe
02:50  Psy: it's not ObjC
02:51  Axman6: i gave up on obj-c too
02:51  Psy: pfff
02:51  Psy: and you made #macosxdev
02:51  Zorg: clusty: yet you use C++
02:51  Zorg: I'm actually trying to learn haskell atm
02:51  Zorg: trying
02:51  Zorg: rawr
02:51  Axman6: Zorg: using lyah?
02:51  Psy: I mean wtf
02:51  Zorg: Axman6: what is lyah?
02:52  Axman6: @where lyah
02:52  lambdabot: http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/
02:52  Axman6: it's the best way to learn haskell
02:52  Axman6: style is inspired by why_'s guide
02:52  Zorg: blast it
02:52  Zorg: i was using some pdf tutorial i got
02:52  Zorg: found on the web that is
02:52  Axman6: it's a fantastic guide though
02:53  Axman6: yeah, all the old things are no good imo
02:53  Axman6: BONUS just has a very good way of teaching
02:53  Zorg: to be honest, i think i found this page
02:53  Zorg: but i didn't take it seriously because of the front cover
02:53  Psy: and puke
02:54  Axman6: Zorg: it's well worth taking seriously
02:54  Axman6: read that, and then read RWH
02:54  Axman6: @where rwh
02:54  lambdabot: http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/
02:55  Axman6: also, if you're trying to learn haskell and you're not in #haskell, you're well and truly doing it wrong ;)
02:55  Psy: well this channel was done wrong as well apparently so why would it be a problem ?
02:56  Axman6: huh?
02:57  Psy: cf ealier comment
02:57  Zorg: Axman6: I'm using yact tutorial atm
02:58  Axman6: haskell has ruined all other languages for me. the only other one i ever work in now is C
02:59  Psy: -_-
03:09  Axman6: bloody hell C++ is ugly
03:23  clusty: any of you started using clang llvm ?
03:24  Axman6: http://productiveblog.tumblr.com/ wow, everything suggested on here is fantastic
03:24  Axman6: clusty: i use it for all my C
03:25  Zorg: haha
03:25  clusty: Axman6: with -O4 ?
03:25  clusty: 5 sorry
03:26  clusty: -O5 turns on link time optimization
03:26  clusty: but i can never get it linking unfortunately
03:27  Axman6: haven't tried
03:54 * Psy uses clang all the time
03:57  clusty: Psy: -O5 ?
03:57  Psy: never tried that

14:39  jubei: I'm building an opengl project and I want to tell xcode "Hey! These two files I want you to copy them to the directory you put the executable in coz I need them on runtime" they are the shaders
14:39  jubei: can I do that easily somehow? just have xcode copy the .glsl files to /Debug /Release accordingly?
15:09  pen: ok

21:29  tgunr: I just discovered NSData writeToFile does not handle paths that are symlinks.
21:42  Psy: tgunr: NSFileManager :)
21:43  tgunr: yeah, i'm looking at ways to detect and resolve but it seems like a bug to me to have to check everytime you want to use NSData writeToFile if the path needs resolving
21:49  Psy: tgunr: well knowing that you to expand in case you have tilde...
22:04  tgunr: my bad, what i thought was a path was a url, calling [url path] now makes it work

23:23  Zorg: tgunr: woo
23:27  tgunr: moving right along
23:27  tgunr: NOT
