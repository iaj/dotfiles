15:06  ayilm1: question... is it possible to call a boolean on whether a button it pressed WHILE another button is pressed?
15:07 @Beelsebob: to "call" a button?
15:08 @Beelsebob: a boolean even
15:09  ayilm1: well what i'm trying to do is give different actions to a button when another is pressed
15:09  ayilm1: think of it like the command key
15:10 @Beelsebob: okay...
15:10  ayilm1: when it is pressed and another key is pressed, it performs an action but if a key is pressed without command, it types a character
15:10 @Beelsebob: and what's the problem with checking the button's state?
15:10 @Beelsebob: waitâ€¦ do you mean key, not button?
15:10  ayilm1: no button haha
15:10 @Beelsebob: then just check the button's state
15:11  ayilm1: how do i check that state?
15:11 @Beelsebob: using the state message perhaps?
15:12  zparta: is there any event or something of the sorts that gives me the possibility to do something on wake and sleep?
15:25  ayilm1: ok so here is what i have mate
15:26  ayilm1: - (IBAction) Shift:(id)sender
15:26  ayilm1: thats obviously the action for the shift button
15:26  ayilm1: then i check teh state of the button, say q,
15:26  ayilm1: - (IBAction) Shift:(id)sender
15:26  ayilm1: {
15:26  ayilm1: 	check ((IBAction)q.state)
15:27  ayilm1: but then how do i get that to act according to whether the state is 1 or not
