00:00  GVT: geirha, you are excluding "1" file?
00:00  geirha: Yes
00:01  geirha: Think of !(...) as  « *, except ... »  e.g. !(foo*)  will match the same as * except the ones also matching foo*
00:02  GVT: geirha, I'd need something like for data in "${prefix}_${subsystem}_"!(afdeling|instelling|entiteit|etc)-data.sql
00:02  GVT: geirha, is there a way to go from the array onderhoudstabellen=(afdeling instelling entiteit) to smth like that?
00:05  dropdrive: How should I reuse code between bash scripts?  E.g. I always write this function everywhere:  die () { echo "$@"; exit 1 }
00:06  erUSUL: dropdrive: make a bash_lib then source it in your scripts
00:06  loomsen: dropdrive: write it to a script and source it in all other scripts
00:06  geirha: GVT: Hm. Not that I can think of. You either use the one with !(afdeling|instelling|...)  or  do a test in the loop.
00:07  dropdrive: erUSUL: I see, just "source fooo" in bar.sh?
00:07  erUSUL: dropdrive: yes
00:07  dropdrive: erUSUL, loomsen: Okay, Thanks.
00:13  lennart__: how can I match a string that can contain any value from 0-6000?
00:14  geirha: if ((var >= 0 && <= 6000)); then
00:14  geirha: if ((var >= 0 && var <= 6000)); then
00:14  geirha: Well, that will fail if var doesn't contain a valid number.
00:15  geirha: !faq valid
00:15  greybot: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/054 -- How can I tell whether a variable contains a valid number?
00:17  lennart__: That one really fails: ((: 3926 >= 0 && <= 6000: syntax error: operand expected (error token is "<= 6000")
00:18  erUSUL: #4 ((: 3926 >= 0 && 3926 <= 6000)) && echo yay
00:19  erUSUL: 4# (( 3926 >= 0 && 3926 <= 6000 )) && echo yay
00:19  shbot: erUSUL: yay
00:19  geirha: GVT: table=${data#"${prefix}_${subsystem}_"} table=${table%-data.sql}; if isIn "$table" "${onderhaustabellen[@]}"; then continue; fi; mysql -u... ; done
00:19  geirha: !faq 46 > GVT, where isIn is the function shown here
00:19  greybot: GVT, where isIn is the function shown here: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/046 -- I want to check to see whether a word is in a list (or an element is a member of a set).
00:20  lennart__: sorry minor error from my side works great now
00:20  geirha: lennart__: Yeah, sorry, missed the var in the second test
00:21  lennart__: geirha: I didn't pay enough attention, so it was not your fault

00:23  rany27: exit
00:31  petteyg: Is there a way to have bash count the number of dots in a string like "1.2.7" (other than passing to grep -c)?
00:33  cthuluh: petteyg: grep -c wouldn't give you a correct result anyway
00:34  geirha: # var='1.2.7' dots=${var//[!.]}; echo "${#dots} dots"
00:34  evalbot: geirha: 2 dots
00:34  cthuluh: grumpf
00:35  cthuluh: he's too fast :)
00:36  geirha: # var='1.2.7'; IFS=. read -r -a fields <<< "$var"; n=${#fields[@]}; echo "$n fields, $((n-1)) dots"
00:36  evalbot: geirha: 3 fields, 2 dots
00:37  erUSUL: # IFS=. read -a a <<< "1.2.7" ; echo "$(( ${#a[@]} -1))"

00:56  brontoeee: how would one prepare endless loop with an option to be killed?
01:02  Tramp: brontoeee: not sure, what you mean. So I'm guessing. You could check for the existence of a file on each iteration and break the loop if it exists
01:03  brontoeee: Tramp, single loop can go for hours, i need inbetween kill
01:04  Tramp: yes. endless loops tend to take a long time, even with lots of processing power
01:06  Tramp: maybe "help trap" and "help kill" help - but I still don't get your problem. If you want to kill something, kill it. (well, in the context of processes, anyways)
01:06  brontoeee: i meant some sort of keyboard break or kill myloop command
01:06  brontoeee: or something
01:07  Tramp: Ctrl-C, like anything else
01:07 --- muzer is now known as MuzerAway
01:08  Adman65: is there anyway to get the PID for the most recent started process? I want to run a command and store the PID for later
01:09  erUSUL: Adman65: $?
01:09  loomsen: $!
01:09  smerz: $? is exit status no? :)
01:10 * erUSUL needs sleep ;)
01:12  cthuluh: Adman65: this will only work for a command that you run in the background, right?
01:13  cthuluh: it won't work if that's a process that "daemonizes" itself
01:13  Adman65: it doesn't daemonize itself
01:22  Smirnov: anyone know how i can automate the prompts by dpkg-reconfigure ?
01:24  cthuluh: Smirnov: dpkg-reconfigure debconf (and that's rather a question for your OS channel, if you need to know more)
01:25  lennart__: how can i use ' as delimiter in cut command?
01:25  cthuluh: "'"
01:25  lennart__: thanx
01:25  krzee: possibly also \'
01:26  lennart__: the first suggestion did the trick
01:27  cthuluh: !quotes > lennart__
01:27  greybot: lennart__: "USE MORE QUOTES!" They are vital. Also, learn the difference between ' and " and `. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes> and <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/words>.

01:46  cthuluh: now you have enough to read fo tonight :)
01:46  Adman65: Ha!
01:46  Adman65: yes
01:47  Adman65: specjour > .specjour/manager.log & ; echo $! > .specjour/manager.pid ; true -- apparently that & ; is illegal

01:48  Edong23: so just remove the ;
01:49  cthuluh: just let him read ;)
01:49  Edong23: sorry
01:49  Edong23: that was interesting to me
01:50  Edong23: i wasn't giving the answer.. it was more... of a wow
01:50  Adman65: wow at what?
01:50  cthuluh: Edong23: np
01:50  Edong23: im not a bash expert by any means, i only recently started actually writing or attempting scripts
01:50  Edong23: more of a wow, like   wow, i didn't know that
01:50  Edong23: not wow   look at those boobs
01:50  Edong23: but   small wow
01:51  cthuluh: huhu
01:54  Adman65: how can I cat a file and use that output to the argument of a function?
01:54  Adman65: err argument of a command
01:55  cthuluh: some command "$(cat file)"
01:55  cthuluh: but that's rather pointless
01:55  cthuluh: go read the guide, work examples hard, understand them
01:55  Edong23: ^ good idea
01:55 * Edong23   starts
01:55  Adman65: how is that example pointless?
01:55  cthuluh: (some might argue that "$(< file)" is more efficient
01:56  cthuluh: no
01:56  cthuluh: but
01:56  cthuluh: !wayttd
01:56  greybot: What Are You Trying To Do?
01:56  Adman65: cat some pid file, then kill that pid
01:57  cthuluh: then it's ok
01:57  cthuluh: kill "$(< file)"
02:00  Edong23: I've done that, but i used the ` way
02:00  cthuluh: !`
02:00  greybot: The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. This syntax is deprecated in favor of foo=$(command). Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
02:00  Edong23: interesting
02:00  Edong23: no need for those for me anymore though, im going to read this whole thing
02:03  soreau: Is there a way to detect if you're running on 64 or 32 bit in bash? For a build script..
02:04  cthuluh: try something hackish with uname, perhaps...
02:05  soreau: Well the reason I mention it's for a build script is because I want to make a correct assumption
02:05  soreau: or add as a flag option
02:05  soreau: but since I haven't seen any other build system flag for 64/32 bit, I was wondering
02:05  Edong23: ...
02:05  soreau: I do not have any 64bit system
02:06  Edong23: let met log into a 64 bit system
02:06  Edong23: i might be able to see some way
02:06  cthuluh: you'd better ask ##workingset for that
02:06  cthuluh: or #autotools
02:06  ferret: soreau: compiling a C program would be one way
02:06  ferret: on linux you can detect the ''lm'' cpuflag in /proc/cpuinfo
02:07  ferret: that will tell you if the processor is 64-bit capable, but nothing about the kernel or the ld or the library support
02:07  soreau: ferret: Yea, I have seen configure scripts compile a small C prog for tests
02:08  ferret: uname -m is supposed to tell you the kernel
02:08  Edong23: ^^
02:08  Edong23: i just did that
02:08  soreau: ferret: How would I figure out if it's 32/64 from a small C program?
02:08  Edong23: $ uname -m
02:08  Edong23: x86_64
02:08  Edong23: uname -m
02:08  Edong23: i686
02:08  dropdrive: Is it generally recommended to write scripts with errexit and nounset?
02:08  ferret: uname -m can be all sorts of things on other unix
02:09  soreau: Compiling a small C program is so much cooler too ;)
02:09  Edong23: lol
02:09  Edong23: ok
02:09  ferret: and it also doesn't really tell you anything, you can have a 64-bit kernel with entirely 32-bit userland
02:09  soreau: indeed
02:09  soreau: but doesn't uname target the kernel specifically?
02:10  cthuluh: !-e > dropdrive
02:10  cthuluh: !set-e > dropdrive
02:10  greybot: dropdrive: "set -e" attempts to tell bash to abort the script if any command returns non-zero. But it fails. Badly. Subtly. Insidiously. Don't use it. Please. Just don't.
02:11  cthuluh: but set -u is useful, yes
02:11  soreau: ferret: But I would be interested in how to use a small C prog to determine weather it's setup for 64 or 32 bit
02:12  ferret: I don't remember off the top of my head
02:13  ferret: Probably just measuring the size of a void pointer is enough
02:13  cthuluh: and it's not a bash question :°
02:13  cthuluh: hmmm
02:13  ferret: just look in pretty much any configure script for any C program :P
02:13  cthuluh: indeed
02:13  soreau: ferret: Thanks
02:14  dropdrive: cthuluh: -u is nounset?
02:14  dropdrive: cthuluh: Thanks for the tip on -e.
02:14  dropdrive: cthuluh: What's the best way to do the negation of "if my_cmd"?  Right now I'm just using the "else" caluse.
02:16  cthuluh: if ! command
02:16  cthuluh: !if
02:16  greybot: if <COMMANDS>; then <COMMANDS>; fi # http://bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php/syntax/ccmd/if_clause # http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals

04:16  doublehp: so, i was saying...
04:16  doublehp: i am filtering a log; i want the line preceeding a given pattern
04:17  doublehp: the pattern is "syslog-ng starting"; for all of you, the line before is "syslog-ng stopping"; but for me, when i freese, it's not the case: i want the last recorded line before the freese
04:18  hmw: ...now that I tried to reproduce my issue with a shell script, ls .. does list the wanted folder, but I remember having "lost" files, when moving to .. or something, while being in a soft-linked folder or similar...
04:21  hmw: doublehp: perhaps this helps: http://www.unix.com/unix-dummies-questions-answers/116387-grep-8-lines-before-after-pattern.html
04:23  doublehp: hmw: that's the heavy way :) the one i wanted to avoid :)
04:23  hmw: -A
04:26  hmw: i am too stupid to find an answer for my issue in google - perhaps the language - i suppose it is due to the targeted folder's .. entry pointing to its real parent - can I make the .. link work like some sort of "backwards" - related to the calling script's location?
04:26  doublehp: << Eterm -e sudo bash -c "export DISPLAY=:0.0; rox /tmp ; echo -e '\nDone (sleeping 10s)'; sleep 3" >> used to work, a few months ago. Now, Rox closes after 10s ... any idea ?

04:31  hmw: i solved my problem, but it made my PHP script uglier... :(
04:32  hmw: and mv'ing a file to .. and then not finding it anymore is a hard thing
04:42  doublehp: 2 bugs prevent me studying 5 bugs ... bugs circularly producing bugs, and preventing me fixing them ...
04:45  hmw: doublehp: i feel reminded on fork bombs somehow *G*
04:45  doublehp: hmw: i remember why i want to avoid the URL you gave me: the log file is 1G big; so if i could avoid parsing it twice ...
04:45  hmw: you dont need to, use the -B option
04:46  doublehp: hmw: no, known kernel hangs; my kernel has 4 bugs => freeses and KP, plus other bugs in "soft land" ...

04:46  SeanBannister: $example1
04:46  SeanBannister: $example2
04:46  SeanBannister: EOF

04:48  hmw: SeanBannister: ^
04:48  SeanBannister: hmw: Yeah I was doing that but there's 50 odd lines I'm writting and it gets messy
04:49  SeanBannister: I can write one line ok with: echo '$example' > file
04:49  SeanBannister: can I do anything similar with cat?
04:49  doublehp: hmw: yes, -B is what i need.
04:49  hmw: SeanBannister: no idea :(
04:50  doublehp: how do i ask sed to ... accept sevral patterns, and, reject some other ? ie, i want paterns A and B, but reject lines containing C
04:50  SeanBannister: Yeah, it's odd because I've been playing around and it doesn't seem to be possible

09:24  lhunath: so put it in a file
09:26  _abc_: Why does somehting like this: sed -e 's/regexp/\n/g' -e '/^$/d not remove the blank lines?
09:26  _abc_: Doesn't d operate on the extra lines generated by s ?
09:27  _abc_: Do I need to use g to copy it back?

09:36  tsolox: ok..tee > the_file does it!!
09:37  tsolox: haha.. it's a good policy to always try what the shell can offer, before doing it in c
09:39  tsolox: not quite there yet...
09:39  pgas: cat > file
09:40  pgas: LinuxKer: makes no sense to me
09:40  LinuxKer: pgas: Can anyone point me to a bash script to Delete Subdirectory but not sub-subdirectory ? That means make all subsub directory a subdirectory in Linux ?
09:40  pgas: oh wait let me read the question above
09:40  LinuxKer: English proble,
09:40  LinuxKer: m
09:42  pgas: what if Folder3 has the same name of an existing folder in Folder1?
09:42  JavaNub: evalbot: arr=(r t f m); echo test'!'
09:42  loomsen: # echo foo
09:42  evalbot: loomsen: foo
09:42  LinuxKer: pgas: It doesn't have
09:43  JavaNub: # arr=(r t f m); echo test'!'
09:43  evalbot: JavaNub: test!
09:43  JavaNub: neato
09:43  LinuxKer: pgas: I have hundres of files sorted using alphatically order which an a folder name "a" where files and folder that start with a go, i want to delete all those a, b,c,d folders
09:43  tsolox: kingsley: thanks..your 'cat > /tmp/output' works well with viewing attachments in mutt!!!
09:44  tsolox: pgas: thanks too
09:45  pgas: LinuxKer: ok, the most straithforward is probably something like: mkdir tmp;mv Folder1/*/* tmp/;rm -rf Folder1/*/;mv tmp/* Folder1/;rm -rf tmp
09:45  LinuxKer: pgas: i will try
09:48  LinuxKer: pgas: Great It works
09:48  LinuxKer: pgas: thanks

09:58  pif: hi, in case .. esac I don't get the diff between ;& and ;;&
10:00  LinuxKer: pgas: If you are free, Any script to categorize folders with similar name into one directory. For example: There are 4 directories named LinuxFedora, LinuxUbuntu, WindowsXP and Windows7. The script should be able to create two folder named Linux and Windows where the respective directories are moved.
