09:31  iaj: i just got the access to a new webpage... am I right that the basic dir.. the root dir of the site, is where .htaccess and index.html is stored?
09:34 +synapt: Um... that's kind of a broad question
09:34 +synapt: considering .htaccess and index.html can be in -any- folder
09:36  iaj: synapt: yeh i know but the layout  (ftp wise) gives:  errorlogs/ logs/ webseiten/   and in the latter, theres a index.html and a .htaccess inside
09:36  iaj: however if I call the ip with /index.html  I get a 404
09:51  wobbles: iaj:  That would be expected behaviour if you are on shared hosting\
09:55  iaj: wobbles: so I can assume that's the correct one :)?
09:55  iaj: Im just about to take over a copy of Typo3 to the other host.. that's why
10:03  wobbles: webseiten sounds logical as the web root - for a Deutsche site :-)
