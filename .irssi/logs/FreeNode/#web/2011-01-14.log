18:07  JoshMandrs: I nominate diamonds as president of #web
18:07 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: vapor.js is
18:07  qwp: err wavemaker just automates model creation, orm mapping, db schema creation, wtfnotelse, formgeneration, html, css
18:08 +diamonds: eggsby: but check out those kickass benchmarks
18:08  qwp: i mean its possible
18:08 +diamonds: qwp: who fucking cares!!!!!
18:08 +diamonds: inevitably you need someone who knows how to use the tool
18:08 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: http://vaporjs.com/
18:08 +dr0id: and the apps are good ?
18:08 +diamonds: "The World's Smallest & Fastest JavaScript Library"
18:08  JoshMandrs: diamonds: you good with js? Like REAL GOOD?
18:09 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: no.  like "medium good"
18:09  qwp: a trend toward higher abstraction and statement power inevitably leads to restricted applicability but if wavemaker is specifically aimed at some wellconstrained problem domain then dont see how it couldnt work
18:09 +eggsby: http://www.touchtrigonometry.org/
18:09 +eggsby: qwp
18:09 +eggsby: you know those template builder websites like godaddy
18:09  JoshMandrs: I'm having problems with my chrome extension, could use your expertise tonight after work.
18:09 +diamonds: qwp: see adobe coldfusion
18:09 +eggsby: 'BUILD YOUR OWN BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE'
18:09 +eggsby: that is wavemaker
18:09  JoshMandrs: --------^
18:09 +eggsby: people who would know how to use it properly don't need it
18:09 +eggsby: people who don't know will make shit with it
18:10  JoshMandrs: Lol diamonds that vapor graph makes me LOL
18:10  qwp: eggsby: no its more, it allows you to have custom db tables and shit, it just automates the entire mvc boilerplate and orm and shit
18:10  oojacoboo: http://www.google.com/search?q=online+property+management  (guess who has #2)
18:10 +dr0id: tell you what
18:10 +dr0id: i get angry
18:10 +eggsby: uh huh qwp
18:10 +dr0id: when i see tools like wavemaker
18:10 +eggsby: so how is that any different
18:10  JoshMandrs: I don't think I can believe someone who makes a graph showing load times for js libraries and puts themselves at zero.
18:10 +dr0id: theres no good tool that could make you a good web app
18:10 +dr0id: NO WAY
18:10 +diamonds: qwp: what's your point
18:10 +diamonds: if you don't know what a ORM is...
18:10  JoshMandrs: oojacoboo: congrats, noticing anything good with it?
18:10 +diamonds: and if you do, you don't need wavemaker
18:10  qwp: diamonds: not sure, lets kill wavemaker
18:10 +dr0id: ORM, haha
18:10 +dr0id: ORM FTL
18:11  oojacoboo: JoshMandrs: gotta launch first, we get lots of leads though
18:11  qwp: diamonds: thats naive. orm runs circles around manual labor
18:11 * diamonds kills qwp 
18:11  JoshMandrs: oojacoboo: I'm not SEO expert, but from my experience, try to stay between #2 and #5 as they usually get the best click throughs.
18:11 +diamonds: oojacoboo: kudos
18:11  JoshMandrs: First position is usually looked past as a "spam" result by most users.
18:11  deveras: Hello Color friends
18:11  oojacoboo: JoshMandrs: #1 gets tons of clicks, but 2-4 are good, then around 7 gets a nice boost
18:11 +theconartist: how much does that get searched oojacoboo
18:12  oojacoboo: theconartist: it's fairly low, I forget the numbers
18:12  qwp: dr0id: well no need to get angry if its a crap tool right?
18:12 +dr0id: i am not :P

18:18  oojacoboo: notice that our site is nothing for content ;)  We'll get a nice boost when we launch a real site

18:18 +diamonds: oojacoboo: got any launch marketing pr tricks up your sleeve?
18:18  JoshMandrs: I was just talking to the owner of Jokeroo.com yesterday.
18:18 +diamonds: t-shirts
18:18 +diamonds: stencils on sidewalks
18:18 +diamonds: branded condoms
18:18 +TheEternalAbyss: damn
18:19  oojacoboo: diamonds: mostly just press releases and submissions to these css gallery sites and things
18:19 +TheEternalAbyss: i'll have to submit stuff
18:19 +diamonds: give branded condoms to middle schools
18:19  JoshMandrs: Jokeroo must be doing well.
18:19  oojacoboo: diamonds: I do have some contacts though :)
18:19 +diamonds: ^^controversy --> publicity
18:19 +TheEternalAbyss: or they are desperately trying to pull users from youtube
18:19  oojacoboo: diamonds: unfortunately, for our business isn't not that demanding, so that seems a bit overkill
18:19 +dr0id: for how long do you guys talk abt useless shit here ? :)
18:20  bazookatooth: for always
18:20 +dr0id: i mean like how many more hours from now ?
18:20  JoshMandrs: TheEternalAbyss: I don't see why they would be.
18:20 +diamonds: TheEternalAbyss: wow $20,000 total *yawn*
18:20  JoshMandrs: Break does the same thing.
18:20  JoshMandrs: Except break is huge.
18:20 +diamonds: wonder how much youtube has paid out...
18:20 +diamonds: .g how much has youtube paid content producers

18:21  JoshMandrs: diamonds: Jokeroo.com isn't a multi-billion dollar company, just a kid who started a funny video site and it grew into a business.
18:21 +TheEternalAbyss: diamonds: eh?
18:21 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: oh
18:21  deveras: Josh jokeroo is for real? I can publish all my crazy bit and get paid ?
18:21  JoshMandrs: Like most of these types of sites do.
18:21  JoshMandrs: Break.com, YouTube.com are the only 2 in the market that weren't started by kids posting funny videos they found.
18:21 +diamonds: whatevs.  the point is tho 20k sounds like a lot, when you spread it out over 1000s of ppl (or even 100s) it's not that much
18:21 +diamonds: .py 2000/100
18:22 +eggbot: diamonds: 20
18:22  JoshMandrs: CollegeHumor.com, jokeroo.com, etc all were started by normal shmoes.
18:22  deveras: NO WAY (u guys have no idea of the pain it us to write in caps in a iPhone)
18:22 +diamonds: ^^see my awesome program
18:22 +TheEternalAbyss: i didn't read that much into the article diamonds: lol
18:22 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: youtube was just too jokers in their basement!
18:22 --- channel_jerk sets modes [#web +v maestrojed]
18:22  JoshMandrs: diamonds: no, it's not... But also you have to realize $20k paid out in 6 months from a company that doesn't sell anything, and only makes it's revenue from a few banners on the site?
18:23 +diamonds: (not really, it was well connected engineers from another large company with access to venture capital :p)
18:23  JoshMandrs: Was just gonna say that :P
18:23 +dr0id: ok, time to go and work now, take care :P
18:23  deveras: They that 1time and that's it or they pay every month for view?
18:23 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: I know they don't hve much $$, I'm saying it's not that much money
18:23 +Migs: as opposed to abnormal schmoes
18:24 +diamonds: it's like, when you calculate it out and ppl make $.50/hr for their video
18:24  JoshMandrs: diamonds: how many sites can you go to, and upload a video of yourself getting hit with a baseball bat or something, and get paid for it?
18:24 +diamonds: people read and say "I could post videos and make money!"
18:24  JoshMandrs: Unless you magically get 1mil+ views on YouTube, probably nowhere.
18:24 +diamonds: I could probably make money faster sitting on the curb with a harmonica
18:25  deveras: So 1video will pay that forever every single month?
18:25  JoshMandrs: Not 100% sure on how the payout works deveras, I'll have to talk to Chris again
18:25 +diamonds: shit, just sitting and ASKING for money I could make more
18:25 +TheEternalAbyss: sit on a curb playing the harmonica and RECORD IT! then you can double your investment!!
18:25  JoshMandrs: But if I'm correct, they pay you a lump sum for the rights to the video, and not for views like YouTube.
18:25 +diamonds: I'm not agin' it, I'm agin' ppl acting like you can actually "make money"
18:25  JoshMandrs: diamonds: You can.
18:26  JoshMandrs: vidmaxx.com
18:26 +diamonds: ok I want to see the breakdown
18:26 +diamonds: how many vids have they bought
18:26  JoshMandrs: Eric, the owner pays out $200/video if he likes your submission.
18:26  deveras: If they pay like that I expect s proper CMS I can log in a watch 15 years of content I collected
18:26 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: is that written somewhere?
18:26 +diamonds: I believe you, but... you know
18:26  deveras: Otherwise I can build my own ;)
18:26  JoshMandrs: Let me find it
18:27 +diamonds: I mean it sounds like you send your vid and agree to take whatever for it, then they get to decide
18:27  deveras: Sounds too good to be true... But ok...
18:27 * diamonds shrugs
18:27 +diamonds: just not a deal I'd take
18:27 +diamonds: feel like a dumbass when they make 10k on the video
18:28  JoshMandrs: So make your own site and collect that $10k yourself :P
18:28  deveras: 10k? On YouTube , hum
18:28 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: you mean that $200
18:28  JoshMandrs: You also gotta realize, bandwidth costs money, if they pay you $200 for your video, and it goes viral and gets hundreds of thousands of views, they probably barely break even.
18:28  deveras: Google has to much money
18:28 +diamonds: whatever I just hate "get rich" bullshit
18:28 +diamonds: "easy money"
18:28  JoshMandrs: They've got staff to pay for, bandwidth, etc...
18:29 +diamonds: 99% of time it's some bullshit that wastes your time and frequently leaves you poorer than you started
18:29  JoshMandrs: So their profit is probably less than yours.
18:31 +TheEternalAbyss: no such thing as get rich quick

18:31  JoshMandrs: Erik himself talking about paying for videos.
18:32  JoshMandrs: I think
18:32  JoshMandrs: I can't honestly tell as I don't have sound :(

18:39 +eggsby: you could add that script to .bash_profile or w/e so it runs on login
18:40 +eggsby: or just call it bin/tmux.sh and run it when you want :p
18:40  _jesse_: I thought about remapping, but apparently ^A is useful for other things
18:40  _jesse_: whereas ^B just goes back a character; I think I can live without that one
18:41  JoshMandrs: What exactly is tmux?
18:42  _jesse_: it's like screen; another terminal multiplexer
18:42  JoshMandrs: Meh

19:10  buddyq: I can't remember
19:10  _jesse_: jsfiddle
19:10  buddyq: yes! thanks
19:12  qwp: eggsby: you just need a number to see what peoples buy from amazon?
19:12 +eggsby: that site is pretty good
19:12  qwp: peoplesssssss
19:12 +eggsby: haven't been there before
19:17  qwp: _jesse_: why did you ban stvs?
19:17 +eggsby: http://abstrusegoose.com/strips/the_amazing_Grace_Hopper_lives_on.PNG
19:18  qwp: eggsby: well the site is only good if the joke is based on fact. wtf would amazon just leak user information if you tell it a number printed on packages?
19:19  JoshMandrs: qwp: because he wanted a 3 month ban.
19:19  qwp: ok
19:19  qwp: eggsby: ANSWER GODDAMNIT
19:20 +eggsby: what sort of answer are you looking for
19:20  qwp: i mean where on amazon can i input that number?
19:21 +eggsby: you weirdo
19:21  qwp: ??
19:21 +eggsby: you know it's a comic right?
19:21 +TheEternalAbyss: lol
19:21  qwp: ok your lack of commitment to freedom and data security is startling
19:22  qwp: and your humor based on baseless fantasy
19:22 +eggsby: the whole joke is based on the premise of a super nerd reverse social engineering guy digging through this dudes garbage bin
19:22 @OreoCookie: xiven, and what are you telling him?
19:23  qwp: well only works if amazon leak such data. the whole joke is based on that super nerd entering it to see what sort of chick lit said paranoiac consumes
19:23  xiven: What am I telling who?
19:24 @OreoCookie: <xiven> I havea guy in private looking for someone to write web content/seo for a hosting company.
19:24 +TheEternalAbyss: http://abstrusegoose.com/3
19:24 +TheEternalAbyss: lol
19:25  _jesse_: qwp: by request
19:25  xiven: Still trying to gather information
19:25  qwp: k
19:26  _jesse_: I believe he intends to work on a php lib, and irc was too distracting for him
19:26  JoshMandrs: If something I said doesn't make sense, you should assume it went over your head and not that I was curious and tried smoking catnip.
19:27  ironfroggy_: Is here any decent way to hide a select option?
19:27  xiven: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't SEO and content writing two different things? I mean for company services you don't want to have a bunch of 'copies' of the same words in front of your visitor....
19:27  ironfroggy_: as neither visibility or display styles seem to affect them?
19:28 +TheEternalAbyss: these comics are XKCD ish
19:28 +TheEternalAbyss: which cam first?
19:28 @OreoCookie: why hide it? disable or enable based on needs
19:28  ironfroggy_: looking to write a filter that would hide options that dont match
19:29 @OreoCookie: content writing and SEO are different, but they go hand in hand with each other. If your content is not written for SEO you will likely not have good seo results
19:30 @OreoCookie: the proper way to do that would be in php else a user can just disable sheetstyling and/or javascript and bypass anything you are hiding
19:30  ironfroggy_: that is silly.
19:31 @OreoCookie: I do it all the time to enable and display options that are "paid only"
19:31  ironfroggy_: as if i would care if they would bypass it. they're the ones filtering.
19:31 @OreoCookie: ahhh I understand now!
19:31  ironfroggy_: its a search field where when typing things in, ti would hide optons that dont include that text.
19:31  ironfroggy_: yes
19:31 +theconartist: http://i.imgur.com/ETYYF.jpg
19:31 @OreoCookie: display: none; should work on any element
19:32 +Migs: theconartist: I don't get it.  Why is he writing it?
19:32  ironfroggy_: OreoCookie: does not work on options, since they aren't laid out like normal DOM stuff.
19:32 +Migs: also, why does the line go up?  "Beam me up" does not actually make the personal physically move vertically.
19:33 +Migs: He is dematerialized, then rematerialized in a different location
19:33  JoshMandrs: http://iwatchedyourhack.org/node/8
19:33  JoshMandrs: I LOL'd
19:33 +Migs: The particles stay still until the dematerialization process is complete.  They don't move.
19:33 +theconartist: then why is it called beaming Migs
19:33  ironfroggy_: maybe it only dematerialized the body, not the marker
19:33 +theconartist: HUH?
19:33  ironfroggy_: adn the particles being pulled up to the ship lifted the pen in their wake
19:33 +Migs: uh, because you're put in the transporter beam
19:33 @OreoCookie: ironfroggy_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1271503/hide-options-in-a-select-list-using-jquery
19:33 +theconartist: ITS A BEAM THAT PULLS YOU UP
19:33 +Migs: they wouldn't do that.  There's no logical reason for doing so.
19:33 +Migs: No, it pulls your PARTICLES up, AFTER the dematerialization
19:33 +theconartist: otherwise he would just say "scotty, teleport me there"
19:33  ironfroggy_: theconartist: teleporters are not tractor beams
19:34 +Migs: There's absolutely zero reason the pen would go up
19:34 +Migs: ironfroggy_: Right.
19:34 +theconartist: thats my point
19:34 +Migs: No it's not.
19:34 +theconartist: ITS A BEAM
19:34 +Migs: And it still doesn't explain why he's writing this.
19:34 +Migs: Do you even know what a beam is?
19:34 +theconartist: hes in the girls bathroom
19:34 +theconartist: cant talk
19:35 +Migs: At any rate, your image is an epic fail.
19:35 +Migs: Stop posting stupid pictures.
19:35 +theconartist: fuck you
19:35 +theconartist: asshole
19:35 @OreoCookie: theconartist, you don't know star trek very well do you?
19:35 @OreoCookie: A transporter is a fictional teleportation machine used in the Star Trek universe. Transporters convert a person or object into an energy pattern (a process called dematerialization), then "beam" it to a target
19:35 +theconartist: ive never even seen even 1 episode
19:35 +theconartist: even
19:36  ironfroggy_: OreoCookie: that post is incorrect. looks like someone just assumed the guy didnt know how variables and strings work, which he didnt, but didnt actually check if hide() works on options
19:36  ironfroggy_: it just sets style.display, which does not work. thanks tho for the link.
19:36 +diamonds: exclusive rights to the videos
19:36 +diamonds: so they must not be able to submit to multiple sites
19:37 +Migs: Fantastic.  Guess we're officially using Joomla 1.6 for our new main web site redesign.
19:37 +Migs: FAN-DIDDLY-TASTIC.
19:37  ironfroggy_: OreoCookie: i notice the poster says it works, that is probably because FF does support this but it seems to be non-standard and its the only browser that does it
19:37 +diamonds: Migs: what the fuck?
19:37 +diamonds: is it 2007 where you live?
19:37 +Migs: I'm officially removing myself from this project and any future support as much as possible.
19:37 +Migs: 2007?  Don't you mean 1997?
19:37 +Migs: I love how Joomla 1.6's big thing is that they got rid of SOME of the table-based layout
19:37 +daekano: lmao
19:37 +diamonds: joomla's not that bad :)
19:37 +daekano: so what you should do
19:37 +daekano: is use drupal
19:38 +daekano: but just swap the logo with joomla's
19:38 +diamonds: Migs: what tables, make your own theme
19:38 +daekano: nobody will know the difference
19:38 +diamonds: maury povich...

19:38 +diamonds: OreoCookie: why does channel jerk output sooo much when you google?
19:39 @OreoCookie: diamonds, because 1 result is never enough thats why by default google lists 10
19:39 @OreoCookie: :p
19:39 +diamonds: I like the tv shows that are like "here's some videos from the internet... we give up :("
19:39 @OreoCookie: I only list 3
19:40  JoshMandrs: REGARDLESS OF HOW A FICTIONAL PERSON IS "BEAMED" UP. that pic is lulzy
19:40 +diamonds: kid superglues hands to face... I wonder if he made $10 on that video
19:40 +daekano: probably recouped the cost of the glue
19:41  JoshMandrs: I love when my boss gets worked up about Casual Friday dress code and I'm all "Vaseline is a solid, dude!"
19:41 +Migs: The pic would be more lulzy if there was a drawing of a dude speaking it or something
19:41 +Migs: THEN I'd laugh
19:42 +Migs: like poop flying up...I'd suppress my observations about the nature of particle transportation to see something funny like that.
19:42 @OreoCookie: ironfroggy_, http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1247755 try that
19:42 +Migs: instead it's just some dumb writing that doesn't make sense in any kind of Star Trek transporter scene context.

19:43 +Migs: clearly whoever made that has never seen an episode of Star Trek
19:44 @OreoCookie: Why is it I am the only person helping this man? and I am the least qualified to give jquery advice!
19:45 +Migs: I'm using jquery for the first time right now
19:45 +Migs: I'd help if I knew more
19:45 +diamonds: OreoCookie: what man?
19:45  JoshMandrs: I didn't read his question, because I'm to busy picking my nose.
19:45  JoshMandrs: Also #jquery is more qualified.
19:46 @OreoCookie: <ironfroggy_> Is here any decent way to hide a select option?
19:46 +Migs: wtf, my daughter has school on Monday?
19:46 +Migs: stupid charter schools
19:46 +diamonds: ironfroggy_: did you try disabling it?
19:46  ironfroggy_: you can see disabled options
19:46 +diamonds: you may need to remove it from the dom

19:47  ironfroggy_: JoshMandrs: sure, as long as your just pulling guesses out your ass
19:47  JoshMandrs: wut
19:48 +diamonds: ironfroggy_: You cannot do this x-browser. If I recall ie has issues. The easiest thing to do is keep a cloned copy of the select before you remove items, this allows you to easily remove and then append the missing items back.
19:48  ironfroggy_: you cant set display style on options. if you coudl, i wouldnt have any question to ask
19:48 +diamonds: does that help?
19:48  JoshMandrs: Did you even read the page?

19:48 +diamonds: Migs: :')
19:49 * Migs bursts into tears
19:49  JoshMandrs: Migs: didn't you say your daughters were 7 and 11?
19:49 +diamonds: that's so cute!

19:49 +Migs: 1, 6, and 7
19:49  JoshMandrs: Oh
19:49  JoshMandrs: I forgot you have 3 and not 2
19:49 +Migs: I mean, she's said "mama" and "dada" and "baba" and stuff, but those don't count

19:51 @OreoCookie: diamonds, didn't you tell him there is no cross compatible solution?
19:51 +diamonds: OreoCookie: no
19:51 +diamonds: you can remove the dom elements, that works crossbrowser
19:52 +diamonds: as for css, no you cannot do this.
19:52 +Migs: squirrels are not people
19:52 +diamonds: you can't style dropdown options in most browsers
19:52 @OreoCookie: yeah i like the solution I pasted better :p

19:57 @OreoCookie: diamonds, its different because originally you didn't provide code (I also posted that link ages ago before I pointed out no one was helping) and you didn't have a working example :p
19:57 @OreoCookie: so hah I win
19:57 @OreoCookie: :p

20:12 +Migs: I knew ironfrogfag was here, because his name is in the nick list

20:13  qwp: i am
20:14 +eggsby: and maestrojed
20:14  qwp: well not sure i am
20:14 +eggsby: if after you learn the basics you want to become a guru, here is a git resource: http://www.gitready.com/
20:14  qwp: dont ask to ask
20:14 @OreoCookie: I KEEL U
20:15  ironfroggy_: Migs: what are you looking to ... agorthimize?
20:17 +diamonds: ironfroggy_'s framework already does that, he just realized
20:18 +diamonds: :p j/k
20:18 +Migs: My graduate student association is doing some research into the concept of learning objects and how they can affect automatic lesson generation.  I'm kind of spearheading the project.  The idea is to use algorithms to determine relevance of content for a given curricular topic.
20:18 +Migs: like a wikipedia page would be parsed, and auto-tagged accordingly
20:18 +Migs: I was mainly just interested in who's a guru around here, don't have any specific questions in mind yet.
20:19 +Migs: I'm seriously thinking I might need to take a few graduate level CS classes on this sort of thing
20:19 +maestrojed: eggsby: thanks!
20:19  ironfroggy_: that sounds less like "agorithm" and more like "natural language processing" which is a whole different scale of problem
20:20 +Migs: it would necessarily use algorithms, though
20:20 +Migs: But you're right, it is an NL situation
20:20  qwp: ask wolframalpha or jeapordy ibm
20:20  ironfroggy_: but my first, probably naive, approach: bayesian classifier
20:20 +Migs: there's a lot more to it, too
20:20  JoshMandrs: <diamonds>	[#web] actually I copy/pasted content from a link JoshMandrs posted and somehow that settled it
20:20  JoshMandrs: <Migs>	[#web] Most JoshMandrs links settle everything
20:20 +Migs: okay
20:20  JoshMandrs: He refused to take my answer
20:20  JoshMandrs: But my answer was correct
20:20  JoshMandrs: What a dingleberry
20:21  JoshMandrs: If someone asked a question, and I answered, and they refused to take the answer which I made, and it happened to be correct... in person.
20:21  JoshMandrs: I'd punch them in the throat.
20:21 +maestrojed: while on the Git subject. Are services like Beanstalk.com worthwhile or unnecessary. http://beanstalkapp.com/
20:21 +eggsby: unnecessary
20:21  JoshMandrs: I'm not a big fan of git, or version control
20:21 +Migs: ironfroggy_: There's been some research on algorithmic shortening of essays to create abstracts, by using a program to highlight the core keywords and topics.
20:22 +Migs: I think that has potential, too.  What I'm doing is creating a working prototype.
20:22  JoshMandrs: I feel like every time I make an update, I'm just copying the folder into a new folder, every time, making me have 300 folders of the same project
20:22 +eggsby: maestrojed: git has internal syntax that has all you need to use it, github is probably the best place to host your repos
20:22 +Migs: JoshMandrs: I just try not to think about it
20:22 +eggsby: free for open source, and 1(?) free closed source repo
20:22 +eggsby: or you can choose to host your own repos
20:22 +maestrojed: eggsby: ahh yes Github. My wife uses that. I should listen more often
20:23 +maestrojed: eggsby Thx for the suggestion
20:23 +Migs: e.g. http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=itj.2009.1249.1255
20:23  JoshMandrs: I find it easier just to make a zip archive of the files and name it project-version.zip and upload it and not have 1000 folders.
20:23 +eggsby: more work
20:23  qwp: Migs: i predict it will be just crap
20:23  JoshMandrs: I can understand if multiple people are working on the same code
20:24  JoshMandrs: But I'm a 1 man army, and I don't allow others to work with my code.
20:24 +Migs: oh, I realize I'll probably never get to the point where it's 100% satisfactory, but I feel it's worth trying.
20:24 +Migs: that's why it's a research project
20:24 +maestrojed: JoshMandrs Yeah over the years I have developer pretty good workflows for managing revisions and launches. But now that I am forming a team and growing Git is constantly recommended to me
20:24 +eggsby: I work alone too but it's just faster to not have to log onto ftp or zip stuff and unzip it
20:24 +eggsby: to instead just push the changes
20:24  JoshMandrs: I only put final production stuff on my server.
20:24  JoshMandrs: Everything else is in a well organized folder on my computer.
20:24 +eggsby: one command via terminal is definitely faster than all those steps
20:25 +maestrojed: JoshMandrs That barely made sense. But its the team aspect that is making me move to formal version control.
20:25 +eggsby: mhmm, yeah version control basically has "branches" so you can have a "production branch"
20:25  qwp: what is github in nutshell?
20:25 +eggsby: and then of course only put stuff in your production branch that you want on your server
20:25 +maestrojed: JoshMandrs "I barley made sense"
20:25  JoshMandrs: Plus I tried to use git once and I wanted to stab Migs in the face.
20:25  JoshMandrs: And that sucks, because I have ZERO ill feelings towards Migs
20:25 +Migs: You can't really make me any uglier, so I don't see the point
20:25 +eggsby: qwp: a place to host version controlled repositories, specifically using git
20:25  ironfroggy_: Migs: i read some about those summary generations, and i think ive seen some tools that do it
20:26  qwp: thanks. its free?
20:26 +Migs: ironfroggy_: It does sound interesting.  Any idea what tools they were?
20:26 +eggsby: qwp: free for open source projects, I don't remember the rules for closed projects
20:26 +maestrojed: Is Stabbing migs in the face free?
20:26 +eggsby: and there are paid accounts too
20:26  ironfroggy_: Migs: if i was doing any of this i would start with nltk.org
20:26  qwp: ok
20:26 +Migs: yeah, I was looking through that site earlier
20:26 +Migs: that's a good idea nonetheless, though
20:26  qwp: so its just a free repository
20:26 +Migs: I really need to get better at Python
20:27  ironfroggy_: join us in #python then
20:27 +eggsby: free repository hosting
20:27 +eggsby: I love python but if its full of ironfroggy_'s
20:27 +eggsby: ...
20:27 +eggsby: ?thepiss ironfroggy_
20:27 +Migs: well, note that he's officially not ironfrogfag anymore
20:27 +eggbot: Migs: How about a little sensitivity? No homo.
20:27  qwp: eggsby: wheres the difference between repository and repository hosting?
20:27 +diamonds: eggsby: botfail
20:27 +eggsby: truee
20:27 +diamonds: ?piss ironfroggy_
20:27 +eggbot: ironfroggy_: no worries mate, just takin' the piss!
20:27  qwp: a repos must be hosted by definition
20:27 +eggsby: ?piss
20:27 +eggbot: no worries mate, just takin' the piss!
20:28 +eggsby: qwp: you can have a local repo
20:28 * diamonds blows smoke from barrels, reholsters guns
20:28 +eggsby: or host a repo on a vps, y'know
20:28  JoshMandrs: .remember pissn No worries mate, just takin' a piss on you!
20:28 +eggbot: JoshMandrs: done.
20:28  qwp: eggsby: well ok but that somewhat defeats the purpose
20:28 +eggsby: having a local repo?
20:28  JoshMandrs: ?pissn ironfroggy_
20:28 +eggbot: ironfroggy_: No worries mate, just takin' a piss on you!
20:28  CoJaBo: way
20:28  CoJaBo: wat
20:28  qwp: eggsby: isnt it?
20:28 +diamonds: qwp: not true
20:28 +eggsby: I guess if we're splitting hairs its still "hosted locally"
20:28 +Migs: * Now talking in #python
20:28 +Migs: * Topic is 'NO LOL | Don't paste, use http://paste.poun
20:28 +diamonds: you can track local changes, fork to test, roll back etc.
20:28 +Migs: NO LOL
20:28 +eggsby: i.e. you can ssh into your home computer and clone it
20:29  qwp: ok but why would you use a local repos?
20:29 +eggsby: NO LOL
20:29  JoshMandrs: LOL
20:29 +Migs: does the #seo guy run #python too?
20:29  JoshMandrs: NO LOL
20:29 * JoshMandrs joins
20:29 +TheEternalAbyss: lol really
20:29  qwp: ok diamonds
20:29 +eggsby: me too
20:29  ColKurtz: so, designers want me to use a large image for a full-bleed background on a web site, and they want it sized appropriately for whatever size monitor the user has. Do you think it'd be best to use a .swf file, or detect the screen width and then serve the appropriately sized image?
20:29 +Migs: <JoshMandrs> How do I get phpinfo in python?
20:29 * diamonds facepalm
20:29 +Migs: hahahaha that's awesome
20:29 +diamonds: JoshMandrs in #python...
20:29  qwp: ColKurtz: latter
20:30  ColKurtz: i know i hate flash too ;D
20:30  qwp: yes
20:30 +diamonds: ColKurtz: you mean detect and resize
20:30 +TheEternalAbyss: ColKurtz: yea i'd detect res
20:30 +diamonds: you can't "serve" an image based on percieved screen size, or shouldn't
20:30 +maestrojed: beyond hating flash. Using flash as a background under html can be a pain in the arse
20:30 +diamonds: if it's full bg, the first thing many users will do is resize to see it move :p
20:32  ColKurtz: you've kind of lost me diamonds
20:33 +diamonds: JoshMandrs: _habnabit has your number :p
20:33  ColKurtz: why shouldn''t i just detect screen size and then set the css background image attribute?
20:33  JoshMandrs: My number?
20:33 +Migs: oops
20:33 +Migs: wrong chan'
20:33 +Migs: !quote add JoshMandrs How does it feel to program in a language that if you go to the .com equivalent to the main site for the language, you get pictures of big black dicks?
20:33 +diamonds: Migs you fool
20:33 @OreoCookie: arg
20:33 +diamonds: ?piss Migs
20:33 +eggbot: Migs: no worries mate, just takin' the piss!
20:33 @OreoCookie: its not hard
20:33 +diamonds: !quoteadd Migs I am silly
20:33 +Migs: wtf, why was I kickbanned first?
20:34  JoshMandrs: Haha
20:34 @OreoCookie: !quoteadd JoshMandrs: How does it feel to program in a language that if you go to the .com equivalent to the main site for the language, you get pictures of big black dicks?

20:34 @OreoCookie: ooo
20:34 @OreoCookie: duhg
20:34  JoshMandrs: eggsby: why were you banned?
20:34 @OreoCookie: !quoteadd JoshManders: How does it feel to program in a language that if you go to the .com equivalent to the main site for the language, you get pictures of big black dicks?
20:34 +diamonds: lol
20:34 +Migs: We need a NO WEB rule in here
20:34 +eggsby: for hanging out with you guys I guess
20:34 +Migs: channel_jerk can auto-kick anyone who says that
20:34 +TheEternalAbyss: lol
20:34  JoshMandrs: eggsby: I'd fight that
20:34 +eggsby: I wonder if they know that python is named after a comedy troupe
20:34 +eggsby: and that the whole premise of the language is lols
20:35  JoshMandrs: I love how I troll and make fun of them for having dicks on python.com
20:35  JoshMandrs: But I say "LOL" and banned.
20:35  JoshMandrs: Fucking nerds really hate laughing.
20:35 @OreoCookie: http://bran.name/dump/pyinfo/index
20:35 @OreoCookie: ?
20:35 @OreoCookie: :p
20:35 +TheEternalAbyss: they ban you for LOL?
20:35  JoshMandrs: Yep
20:36 @OreoCookie: in #seo?
20:36 @OreoCookie: :p
20:36 +TheEternalAbyss: that's retarded
20:36 +maestrojed: lol
20:37 +TheEternalAbyss: banning for LOL
20:37 +TheEternalAbyss: wtf
20:37  JoshMandrs: Say it again TheEternalAbyss
20:37  JoshMandrs: I DARE YOU
20:37 * JoshMandrs gets the banhammer ready

20:48 +TheEternalAbyss: for real
20:50 +Migs: http://files.sharenator.com/macfffffuuuuu_FFFFFUUUUUUUUU-s580x439-25163-580.jpg
20:50  JoshMandrs: I HATE THAT
20:50 +eggsby: lol
20:51 +eggsby: I prepare my cheese sauce as the water is heating up
20:51 +TheEternalAbyss: lmao
20:51 +eggsby: never happens to me 8)
20:51  JoshMandrs: Ruins the mac&cheese and makes me not want it anymore, so instead I whip the scolding hot boiling water into my nieces face and run to my room crying
20:51  _jesse_: nooooo, nightmares
20:51 +TheEternalAbyss: me neither since I don't really eat mac and Cheese
20:51  cgcardona: mmmmm mac and cheese
20:51  JoshMandrs: Shit's the best dog.
20:51 +Migs: same applies to pasta roni
20:51  JoshMandrs: Mac & Cheese + Baked Beans
20:51  cgcardona: what would life be without mac and cheee
20:51  cgcardona: ?
20:51 +TheEternalAbyss: JoshManders: your nieces probably deserve it though, right?
20:51  JoshMandrs: DON'T KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT
20:51 +Migs: MMMMMMMMMMMmmmm baked beans
20:52  JoshMandrs: TheEternalAbyss: she deserves everything.
20:52 +TheEternalAbyss: well there you go, it's all good tho
20:52 +Migs: I'm cooking mac and cheese tonight.   My wife's hot friend is coming over and they're bringing polish dogs.
20:52  _jesse_: JoshMandrs: I'm knocking it
20:52  JoshMandrs: cgcardona: I'd probably kill _jesse_
20:52  _jesse_: D:
20:52  JoshMandrs: Migs: I'm gonna get some mac&cheese for tonight too
20:52  JoshMandrs: Make a shit ton
20:52  JoshMandrs: Eat it all weekend
20:52  JoshMandrs: LIKE A BAWS
20:52 +Migs: niiiiice
20:52 +Migs: I asked my wife to go buy, like, 10 boxes of it
20:53  JoshMandrs: Because once I get home, pants are coming off, and I'm not leaving my room all weekend.
20:53 +Migs: I used to hate easy mac, but now it's grown on me.  But this time we're doing a HOMEGROWN recipe
20:53 +Migs: omg that's how I am!
20:53 +Migs: I just unzip and let it all hang out
20:53  JoshMandrs: \o
20:53 +eggsby: .dick
20:53 +eggbot: 8=========D
20:53 +eggbot: 8=====D
20:53  JoshMandrs: Migs: I think we're destined for each other.
20:53 +Migs: haha
20:53  _jesse_: eggsby: the only time that's been appropriate thus far
20:53 +Migs: well, I have to cover it up a little when the kids come in from playing
20:54 +Migs: but I still leave my pants unzipped
20:54  _jesse_: who's is who's?
20:54 +eggsby: I'm going to rewrite it... hold on
20:54  JoshMandrs: .dicks @_jesse_
20:54 +eggbot: 8=======D
20:54 +eggbot: 8=========D
20:54  JoshMandrs: .dicks _jesse_

20:54  _jesse_: *whose
20:54  JoshMandrs: Gay
20:54  JoshMandrs: HAHA
20:54 +eggsby: rewriting it to do that JoshMandrs
20:54  JoshMandrs: the middle one is yours _jesse_
20:54 +Migs: my wife's all "OMG ZIP UP YOUR PANTS!"
20:54 +Migs: And I'm like, "NO."
20:54  JoshMandrs: <eggbot> 8=D
20:54  JoshMandrs: --^ _jesse_
20:54  _jesse_: hmm I see
20:54  _jesse_: that's unfortunate
20:54 +TheEternalAbyss: ok i actually have a #web related question
20:55 +Migs: I wear the pants in the household, and I'll decide if they're unzipped or not.
20:55 +TheEternalAbyss: *gasp*
20:55  JoshMandrs: Migs: I don't leave them unziped, I take them completely off.
20:55 +Migs: now let's see if we have #web related answers
20:55 +TheEternalAbyss: if I change the font-size for a div, why won't it apply to a ul?
20:55 +TheEternalAbyss: that's inside the div
20:55  JoshMandrs: Sometimes I don't wear boxers either... Unless they're on my head while I watch reruns of Pete & Pete.
20:55 +Migs: I don't do that anymore.  I USED to.  We used to just walk around either naked or in underwear.
20:55 +Migs: but you can't really do that with kids
20:56  JoshMandrs: Hmm
20:56  JoshMandrs: I'll rent some kids and give it a whirl
20:56 +eggsby: .dick migs
20:56 +eggbot: 8%sD~~~ %s
20:56 +eggsby: fffeh
20:56  JoshMandrs: I'll report back ASAP
20:56 +Migs: where do you get reruns of Pete & Pete?
20:56  JoshMandrs: TheEternalAbyss: do you have the font-size already set for that ul?
20:56 +Migs: wow, what's wrong with my dick?
20:56 +Migs: .dick eggsby
20:56 +eggbot: 8%sD~~~ %s
20:56  JoshMandrs: Migs: Pirate Bay
20:57 +eggsby: .dick dick
20:57 +eggbot: 8==============D~~~ dick
20:57 +eggsby: YEAAA
20:57  JoshMandrs: .dick _jesse_
20:57 +eggbot: 8===========D~~~ _jesse_
20:57  cgcardona: <Migs>wow, what's wrong with my dick? <----------- classic :-)
20:57 +TheEternalAbyss: http://dev.thierry-corp.com/index.php?id=198
20:57 +TheEternalAbyss: scroll down and you'll see what i mean
20:57 +Migs: hahahahaha
20:57  JoshMandrs: !addquote Migs: wow, what's wrong with my dick?
20:57  JoshMandrs: Need to fix that gay ass quote bot
20:57 +eggsby: enabling .q add
20:57  JoshMandrs: Some golden quotes going on and we can't log em :(
20:58 +Migs: isn't it !quoteadd?
20:58 +Migs: why are we using channel_jerk again?
20:58 +TheEternalAbyss: i want all my text to by a bigger font size
20:58  JoshMandrs: .q add Migs wow, what's wrong with my dick?
20:58 +TheEternalAbyss: (inside the div i mean
20:58 +Migs: didn't we establish that you can't add quotes for other people?
20:58 +TheEternalAbyss: it won't apply to the ul
20:58 +Migs: I already missed some quotes I wanted to add for JoshMandrs
20:58 +eggsby: .q add Migs wow, what's wrong with my dick?
20:58  JoshMandrs: ----^
20:58 +eggbot: eggsby: quote added.
20:58  _jesse_: TheEternalAbyss: fon't size is overridden
20:58  _jesse_: *font
20:58 +Migs: That's a whole hilarious moment, undocumented.
20:58  _jesse_: it's set to 12 px
20:58  JoshMandrs: eggsby: so is eggbot gonna take over channel_jerk's position?
20:59 +Migs: Please say yes.
20:59 +eggsby: yes
20:59 +Migs: I don't even see why we're bothering with channel_jerk's alleged quotebot
20:59  JoshMandrs: Awesome
20:59 +TheEternalAbyss: oooh.....frack
20:59  JoshMandrs: Will I still have botmaster?
20:59 +TheEternalAbyss: _jesse_ yea just saw that
20:59 +eggsby: I'll hopefully be writing admin functionality into eggbot this weekend
20:59  JoshMandrs: Score
20:59  _jesse_: eggsby: nice
20:59 +eggsby: as well as a functionality to .g to have it act more like oreo's
20:59 +eggsby: in that you'll be able to say how many results you want
20:59 * JoshMandrs is 110% sure he's gonna lose bot master and won't be able to do anything :(
20:59 +TheEternalAbyss: thanks _jesse_
21:00  JoshMandrs: Oh well
21:00  JoshMandrs: eggbot > channel_jerk
21:00 +eggsby: so like .g query | #
21:00  JoshMandrs: Should also make it default so we can just do .g query
21:00  JoshMandrs: Default to 1
21:00 +eggsby: yeah, of course
21:01  JoshMandrs: Basically all eggbot really needs is the ability to do op functions
21:01  JoshMandrs: Auto op/voice/ban/etc.
21:01  JoshMandrs: Which shouldn't be hard.
21:01  JoshMandrs: Basically like ?trigger except .remember is to add user to database, and ?trigger is done on JOIN
21:02 +TheEternalAbyss: hmmmmmmm
21:02  _jesse_: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
21:02 +TheEternalAbyss: how is !important not overriding it
21:02 +TheEternalAbyss: >.<
21:02  _jesse_: plz don't use !important

21:26 +TheEternalAbyss: hehe
21:26 +daekano: so the walking dead doesn't suck
21:26  _jesse_: I've been meaning to check that out
21:26  JoshMandrs: http://trollscience.com/troll/view/2202
21:26 +daekano: hit it up jesse
21:26  JoshMandrs: daekano: it never did
21:26 +daekano: heyoo
21:27  JoshMandrs: Zombies + guns + people dying + more than 2 hours = win
21:27 +daekano: just watched episode one
21:27 +daekano: finally a tv show that realizes it doesn't need to be full of inane dialogue to be interesting
21:27 +Migs: I love The Walking Dead
21:27  JoshMandrs: ---^
21:28 +Migs: I hate that I have to wait until next year to watch more, but at least it was a good show
21:28  JoshMandrs: I can't wait until Season 2
21:28 +Migs: also, Darabont fired his whole staff
21:28 +Migs: I hope the new staff isn't a step backward
21:28  JoshMandrs: I also hope it beats out The Simpsons as the longest running series EVAR.
21:28 +daekano: Speaking of next seasons, Breaking Bad needs to gtfhere
21:28 +Migs: OMG I know
21:28 +Migs: That's gotta be one of the best shows ever
21:28 +daekano: I mean don't get me wrong
21:28  JoshMandrs: daekano: word
21:28  JoshMandrs: AMC puts out some awesome shows.
21:28 +daekano: I'm completely okay with producers and directors taking extra time to get it right
21:28 +daekano: I'd rather it not be piss poor and half done
21:28 +Migs: I don't think AMC has put out a bad show ever since it started doing these series
21:28 +daekano: but I still want it now :(
21:29  JoshMandrs: But they have a bad habit of making the first season short, and then the wait period so long.
21:29 +daekano: Well?
21:29 +daekano: Good marketing IMO
21:29 +Migs: oh I agree.  The only thing I care about is quality, not quantity.  Make the season as short as you want, but make it GOOD.
21:29  JoshMandrs: Not really
21:29 +Migs: Don't mass-produce a whole bunch of episodes that are full of mindless drivel
21:29  JoshMandrs: Good marketing will keep the users coming to the channel, not "welp the season is over, I guess I'll just flip past for another year"
21:29 +daekano: AMC isn't exactly super high budget like NBC or ABC
21:29 +daekano: If they start a new series, make the first season shorter and then wait to see how far it takes off
21:29 +Migs: and Walking Dead is a ridiculously high budget show
21:30 +daekano: Then adjust your budget accordingly
21:30 +daekano: I wouldn't agree with that Migs, the CG is still a little sub par
21:30 +daekano: I'd have to see numbers
21:30 +Migs: uh, I have seen the numbers
21:30 +Migs: It's not pretty
21:30 +daekano: hm
21:30 +Migs: The CG is fine
21:30 +eggsby: yeah it is quite high budget
21:30 +Migs: You're too picky.
21:30 +daekano: meh
21:30 +Migs: Great makeup jobs, too
21:31 +daekano: You mean those aren't real zombies?
21:31 +daekano: WTF
21:31 +daekano: I feel cheated.
21:31  JoshMandrs: <Migs> You're too picky.
21:31  JoshMandrs: Bingo
21:31  JoshMandrs: People are to picky
21:31  JoshMandrs: Who cares if it's slightly under realistic.
21:32  JoshMandrs: IT'S A FUCKING TV SHOW
21:32 +Migs: No kidding
21:32 +daekano: We're talking about budget vs CG
21:32  _jesse_: way to raise the temperature
21:32 +daekano: not whether or not it's a good TV show or realistic
21:32 +daekano: lol
21:32  JoshMandrs: If you think the CG is horrible, then go back to your Adobe Premiere and jackoff, you nerdfag.
21:32 +eggbot: JoshMandrs: How about a little sensitivity? No homo.
21:32 +Migs: I hate how kids nowadays refer to play a game if it doesn't have cutting-edge state-of-the-art graphics
21:32 +Migs: It's the same thing here
21:32 +Migs: It's all about the STORY
21:32 +daekano:  /eyeroll
21:32 +Migs: er
21:32 +Migs: *nowadays refuse to
21:32  JoshMandrs: daekano: not talking about what you meant
21:33 +daekano: fair enough.
21:33 +Migs: I just finished playing Tales of Monkey Island...and I LOVED it
21:33 @OreoCookie: _jesse_, what ya need?
21:33  JoshMandrs: I'm just sick of people saying "ZOMG, THE WALKING DEAD SUCKS, THERE'S A SHADOW ON THE CAR GOING THE OPOSITE DIRECTION AS THE REST!! WORST SHOW EVER!!"
21:33  _jesse_: Migs: I think most kids will play games if the gameplay is good
21:33 +Migs: I mentioned it to my coworker and he just couldn't get past how "lame" the graphics are
21:33 +daekano: People say that Killswitch?
21:33  JoshMandrs: daekano: tons do.
21:33 +Migs: I know, JoshManders
21:33 +daekano: rofl
21:33  _jesse_: OreoCookie: still can't get that ban thing working, I put....
21:33 +daekano: I just didn't like how they put CG barrels in a field
21:33 +daekano: it's like... why not just buy real barrels
21:33 +daekano: >.>
21:33  JoshMandrs: Meh
21:33 +Migs: probably because CG barrels are cheaper?
21:34 +Migs: I dont' even remember any CG barrels.  Must've not been that bad
21:34  JoshMandrs: I didn't pay attention to any barrels anyway, so I don't think it matters.
21:34 +Migs: yeah, whotf cares about barrels?
21:34 +daekano: lmao
21:34 @OreoCookie: well .... wouldn't do much of anything :p
21:34 +daekano: well episode 2 is done
21:34  _jesse_: OreoCookie:  "!+ban stvs finsh your library! 129600" and it unbanned 30m later or so
21:34  JoshMandrs: My eyes were glued to boobs, guns, and racists.
21:34 +daekano: I'll report back on CG.
21:34  JoshMandrs: Also zombies
21:34 +Migs: The other retardedly awesome show is Dexter
21:34 +daekano: ?fu
21:34 +eggbot: FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
21:34  _jesse_: OreoCookie: or rather it appears to have been 2 hours
21:34 +Migs: They don't have a lot of fancy CG, and that show is top quality
21:34 +daekano: blah
21:35  _jesse_: they don't need CG
21:35 +daekano: Dexter was so uninteresting to me
21:35  JoshMandrs: WOrd

21:35  _jesse_: ^
21:35 +eggsby: californication owns
21:35 +Migs: daekno: Whoa, how?
21:35  JoshMandrs: I need to get more episodes of Dexter.
21:35 +Migs: Why?
21:35 +daekano: I also hate the cult fanbase
21:35 +eggsby: .tv californication
21:35 +daekano: it's getting annoying
21:35 +eggbot: eggsby: the next episode of Californication airs 2011-01-16 (S04E02 - Suicide Solution)
21:35 +Migs: Then ignore them
21:35 +Migs: I have no idea what the "fanbase" is even saying about Dexter
21:35 @OreoCookie: um why would you try to issue an 1 year ban in minutes?
21:35 @OreoCookie: erm 1 month?
21:35 @OreoCookie: what is it?
21:35  JoshMandrs: eggsby: I saw the first few episodes of Californication, seems promising, but I just never watched anymore
21:35 +daekano: OMG DEXTER IT'S A TV SHOW ABOUT A SLASHER I RELATE TO HIM PERSONALLY BECAUSE I PRETEND TO HAVE HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES IN EFFORT TO BE POPULAR AMONG MY GROUP OF OUTSIDER PEERS
21:35 +Migs: I just recently found out that the characters who play Dexter and Debra got married, AND divorced
21:35 @OreoCookie: thats retarded amount of time
21:35 @OreoCookie: lol
21:35 +Migs: that's how up-to-date I am
21:35  _jesse_: OreoCookie: you said there was no conversion; and it should be 90 days

21:36 +daekano: lol
21:36  _jesse_: Migs: crazy
21:36 +eggsby: yeah
21:36 +Migs: JoshMandrs: Something like that.  I don't know, I haven't been "following" it, because I don't care about celebrities.
21:36 +eggsby: show must be awkward now that they are divorced
21:36  JoshMandrs: Probably got to weird playing brother and sister on TV, then going home to have sex.
21:36 +daekano: up here there are entire groups of goth kids that try to be as devoted to dexter as possible
21:36 +Migs: Except when they're ridiculed, possibly
21:36 +daekano: it's the dumbest thing i've ever seen
21:36  _jesse_: daekano: I haven't heard anyone say that O_o
21:36 +Migs: that's why they're called actors
21:36 +daekano: no, it was sarcastic. notice the caps
21:36  JoshMandrs: daekano: must be a Caneduh thing
21:36 +daekano: i suppose
21:37 +Migs: daekano: What wasn't interesting about it though?
21:37  _jesse_: I thought caps == SHUOT
21:37 +Migs: How many episodes did you even watch?
21:37 +Migs: I was actually hooked after one episode
21:37 +daekano: I watched a few episodes over at my buddy's place and really didn't care
21:37  JoshMandrs: _jesse_: caps === CRUISE CONTROL FOR AWESOME
21:37 +Migs: my buddy wasn't too impressed
21:37  RudyValencia: Why does the @font-face I set up disappear in IE when I add my clock-updating JavaScript?
21:37  JoshMandrs: You know what show is VERY underestimated?
21:37 +TheEternalAbyss: lol
21:37  JoshMandrs: TRAILER PARK BOYS!
21:37 +daekano: I'm also really desensitized to any and all cop/crime related story
21:37 +daekano: TPB FTW
21:37 +daekano: RIP
21:37 +Migs: I also like Dexter because my wife gets all hot and bothered when she's watching the show, and that's good for me.
21:37 +daekano: 3LA
21:37  JoshMandrs: Fucking Bubbles, makes me LOL hard.

21:38  _jesse_: RudyValencia has a question people; to attention!

21:38 +eggsby: FIRED
21:38 +daekano: hahahahaha
21:38  RudyValencia: My specific example that I'm trying to get @font-face to work with is http://test.uvdata.info/
21:38  JoshMandrs: .gis trailer park boys bubbles
21:38 +eggbot: JoshMandrs: http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/06/23/trailer-park-boys.jpeg
21:39 +cgcardona: off to that beach with my son - bbiab
21:39 +daekano: IN A HILARIOUS IRC FASHION, I'M YOUR BOSS, YOU'RE FIRED.
21:39 +daekano: You know they actually had a huge field of marijuana for that show?
21:39  RudyValencia: "Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside..."
21:39 * daekano palms his face.
21:39  JoshMandrs: I F'n love it
21:39  JoshMandrs: Ricky = amazing weed grower
21:39  RudyValencia: -- Eminem, "Without Me"
21:39 +daekano: yeah.
21:39  JoshMandrs: Julian = always has alcohol in his hand
21:40  JoshMandrs: Bubbles = fucking riot
21:40 +daekano: Ricky was the man.
21:40 +daekano: Every time he dealt with cops I lost it
21:40  JoshMandrs: Haha
21:40 +daekano: It's so funny how he gets out of every situation
21:40  RudyValencia: Anyway
21:40  JoshMandrs: Yeah
21:40  RudyValencia: I guess I better take this to Aardvark
21:40  JoshMandrs: Randy always made me LOL too
21:40  _jesse_: no more offtopic until we find a solution for RudyValencia
21:40  JoshMandrs: With his running around without a shirt on
21:40 @OreoCookie: _jesse_, I am looking into it
21:40  JoshMandrs: Having to take his pants off to fight
21:41 +daekano: hahahaha
21:41 * _jesse_ looks at JoshMandrs and daekano 
21:41  JoshMandrs: I agree
21:41 +eggsby: page looks fine RudyValencia
21:41 * JoshMandrs goes back to work
21:41 +eggsby: of course without that code enabled who knows what might be going wrong
21:41  _jesse_: eggsby: apparently it's only bad in IE
21:41 +eggsby: oh
21:41  RudyValencia: It happens in IE regardless of the JS being enabled or disabled
21:41 +daekano: Right because @font-face won't work in IE unless you're using open source font extensions
21:42 +daekano: .eot I think
21:42  RudyValencia: I did make an IE EOT font out of the font I'm using
21:42 +daekano: make?
21:42  RudyValencia: I converted the original TTF using Fontsquirrel
21:44 @OreoCookie: set knicks [split [lindex [split $arg] 1] ,] if {[llength [lrange [split $arg] 2 end]] == 1} { if {[string is integer [lindex [split $arg] end]]} { set kreason "$my(logo): Requested by $nick." set btime "[lindex [split $arg] end]"}
21:44 +daekano: don't you have to call it with font-family
21:44 +daekano: hm
21:44 @OreoCookie: I don't get why its doing that ...
21:45 @OreoCookie: any time should be acceptable
21:45  RudyValencia: I'm gonna try that real quick
21:45 @OreoCookie: hopefully your not trying anything I posted cause it won't help you
21:45  RudyValencia: Nope. breaking up the font-size and font-family declarations doesn't work.
21:45 @OreoCookie: :p
21:46  RudyValencia: I know, you're posting something else unrelated
21:47 +Migs: <strlen> what's everyone doing on Marxist Lucifer Koon day?
21:47 +Migs: haha
21:48 +daekano: Well what version of IE are you testing it in Rudy?
21:48  RudyValencia: version 8, WinXP
21:48  RudyValencia: I can also go back to v7 and v6 through IETester.
21:49 +daekano: Rudy did you grab the information from this article? http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/how-to-achieve-cross-browser-font-face-support/
21:50  RudyValencia: I already know how to use @font-face because one of my other sites uses it
21:50  RudyValencia: er, two of them use it (almost forgot my personal site)
21:50 +daekano: hm
21:51  RudyValencia: I think I see why it's not displaying. This is a custom font, with symbol encoding.
21:51  _jesse_: RudyValencia: is it particular to that specific font?
21:51  _jesse_: mmm
21:51  RudyValencia: I think that Fontsquirrel's conversion process is not converting it correctly.
21:52 +daekano: Which would make some sense
21:52 +daekano: because it's the .eot source that isn't working.
21:52 +daekano: Whereas the ttf is working great on Chrome
21:52  RudyValencia: It's something I want to do because this site is for making listings for the software that ran the "Prevue Guide" channel
21:52 @OreoCookie: Okay eggsby when you get a chance re-enable your quote system and I will fully disable mine (unless you want to copy the help files and incorporate)
21:53  JoshMandrs: .q #web
21:53 +eggbot: JoshMandrs: [5/80] 2010-11-11 <Apl> K1llswitch is kinda "special" isn't he
21:53  RudyValencia: The font contains the symbols that were in the software's display font.
21:53  RudyValencia: (which is called "PrevueC")
21:54  RudyValencia: What I want to do is make the TT font so that the symbols are activated at their appropriate places
