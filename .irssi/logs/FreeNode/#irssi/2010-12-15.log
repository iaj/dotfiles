15:33 +otrZensur: hello! I often hgave the problem, that my posts are getting to long, that I write more then 500 chars.  I found 2 scripts dealing with this problem: "splitlong.pl" and "autowrap.pl".  the first one is using "command_bind('msg',...) and the other one "signal_add_first('send text',...)  which is the better way to aktivate a script in my case?
15:34 +zmx: billnye: sorry, my poor english level don't help to understand you. They are a 'default' remote notification process ?
15:34 +ferret: otrZensur: they both (almost) work, so does it matter?
15:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v PsyTrance]
15:34 +ferret: I think more people use splitlong.pl, it seems to be mentioned here more often
15:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Ironnads]
15:39 +otrZensur: ferret: "splitlong.pl" is the more well-engineered script; but I am interested in the way, all scripts that I am using are working.  ....oh, sorry, my english is terrible this day! :-/
15:40 +billnye: zmx: not default, but a couple standard ones
15:40 +billnye: zmx: I don't, however, know if any are set up for Android support
15:41 +zmx: I don't know too. But trigger.pl with the 3rd party part can do the job I think
15:41 +ferret: otrZensur: I found about six errors in that script, made my own versions.  Couldn't be bothered to submit them though.

16:14 +goltoof: hai room
16:15 +goltoof: i'm looking for a script that'll make pm's appear in whatever room i'm in.  as it is now i don't event get a notice when i get a pm
16:15 +Babar: hilight_win.pl
16:15 +deryni: You should see an item in your Act: bar for the window.
16:15 +deryni: That script doesn't quite do what he wanted, but I think I saw one that does the other day on the site.
16:16 +goltoof: so i'd like the pm to show in the message in its own window as well as the room i'm currently in
16:17 +goltoof: deryni:  was that directed at me? Act bar ?
16:18 +Babar: deryni: it pretty much does that. It doesn't show it in the active window, but in a dedicated split window
16:18 +Babar: which I find cleaner, but maybe he wants something else
16:21 +billnye: takes away race conditions where a hilight comes to the "active" window just as it's becoming the not-active-anymore one
16:21 +deryni: I'm not arguing hilight_win isn't better than what he wanted, just pointed out it wasn't what he asked for.
16:22 +deryni: goltoof: And yes, that was to you. The default statusbar has an Act: item which lists windows with activity.
16:22 +deryni: If you don't have it that would explain why you are having a problem noticing them.
16:22 +goltoof: :S
16:22 +billnye: deryni: agreed
16:22 +goltoof: oh.. AFTER i get the hilight thingy ?
16:22 +goltoof: let me try that
16:22 +billnye: goltoof: hmm? what are you trying?
16:23 +billnye: I think you may still be confused :)
16:23 +goltoof: what's the noticemove.pl
16:23 +goltoof: billnye:   i don't think i'm confused, just confusing everyone else
16:24 +goltoof: does my question make sense though? is that possible to see the pm in the room i'm currently in?
16:24 +billnye: goltoof: with a script it's possible
16:24 +billnye: and NOTICES is different from MSGS
16:24 +goltoof: billnye:  sorry.. does the script exist?
16:24 +goltoof: :s
16:24 +billnye: goltoof: not that /I/ know of, but I don't know them all
16:24 +goltoof: whats the diff?
16:25 +Nei: might be possible without a script?
16:25 +Nei: fiddle with levels
16:26 +billnye: goltoof: a) they're a different communication method, ususally more typical of bots than humanoids
16:26 +goltoof: billnye:   i don't think i'm confused, just confusing everyone elseokay... msgs, notices, levels?  i never felt so dumb so early
16:26 +goltoof: oops
16:26 +billnye: b) that moves not displays an additional copy
16:26 +goltoof: oh notices are from bots?
16:26 +billnye: goltoof: not exclusively, just typically
16:26 +goltoof: i'd like to see both
16:27 -#irssi- spb: this is a notice
16:27 +spb: this is a msg
16:27 +msparks: you are a notice.
16:27 +billnye: UR MOM NOTICES UR FACE
16:27 +goltoof: lol billnye... i was just about to say something similar
16:28 +spb: the convention is that NOTICE expects no response, and bots should make sure that (1) all responses are NOTICE and (2) they never respond to NOTICE
16:28 +billnye: goltoof: the "hilightwin" mentioned above, http://billnye.blinkenshell.org/irssi/putty20080818.png
16:29 +msparks: a screen within a screen
16:29 +msparks: WE NEED TO GO DEEPER
16:29 +billnye: :)
16:29 +goltoof: did i just mute myself?
16:29 +msparks: yes
16:29 +billnye: that top window displays a copy of all direct notices "billnye: hey there!" and PMs
16:29 +shabble: spb: s/convention/the magical happy unicorn world/, but yeah :)
16:29 +billnye: we can't hear you
16:29 +billnye: O:)
16:29 +goltoof: spd:  so any conversation with a bot is a notice
16:29 +msparks: I would be angry with any bots that talked back to me in notices.
16:29 +spb: goltoof: a request to the bot is a privmsg, and the bot's response is a notice
16:30 +spb: shabble: all well-written bots follow that
16:30 +goltoof: no.. turns out when you put a / in from of whatever you're writing doesn't yield best results
16:30 +shabble: spb: in that case, there are a vast majority of badly written bots.
16:30 +billnye: :)
16:30 +shabble: I realise why it's so, but most things I've seen don't work like that.
16:30 +spb: shabble: yes, there are
16:30 +goltoof: msparks:   depends on the bot
16:31 +msparks: ah ha, I thought I recognized your nick, spb
16:31 +msparks: you wrote eir.
16:31 +spb: yes, i did
16:31 +spb: amongst other things
16:31 +msparks: of course.
16:32 +goltoof: eir?
16:32 +billnye: I assume this is a software project of some sort, not the spivak pronoun?
16:32 +msparks: http://svn.freenode.net/eir/wiki/DesignOverview
16:32 +msparks: compnerd pointed me at it once
16:33 +msparks: spb: just curious, what is the rationale for responding with notices? To avoid triggering any scripts on the client's end?
16:33 +shabble: msparks: and preventing bot feedback loops for public messages.
16:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lewellyn]
16:34 +spb: msparks: it avoids infinite message loops between bots
16:34 +goltoof: so i got hilight script loaded... what now?
16:34 +msparks: that was amusing in the infobot days
16:35 +spb: imagine two bots that each respond to invalid commands with a PRIVMSG saying "unknown command"
16:35 +shabble: I've seen spectacularly badly-written bots that can trigger themselves.
16:35 +msparks: goltoof: make a new windwo called hilight
16:35 +spb: then one privmsgs the other for some reason
16:35 +goltoof: msparks:  how?  :)
16:35 +msparks: goltoof: /window new hidden, /window name hilight. Did you read the comments in the script?
16:35 +goltoof: why would you ever want two bots to talk to eachother?
16:36 +msparks: goltoof: you wouldn't. It's inadvertent most of the time.
16:36 +goltoof: o i c
16:37 +goltoof: pm me pls
16:38 +goltoof: someone pm me.. to test
16:38 +goltoof: pls
16:38 +billnye: it's probably most usefulwhen it's not hidden, tbh
16:39 +msparks: of course
16:39 +goltoof: :s
16:39 +goltoof: and whats a hidden window?
16:39 +msparks: split it another day.
16:39 +goltoof: splits windows.. i can live with that
16:39 +msparks: http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssisplit
16:40 +goltoof: msparks.. how can i unhide my hilight window?
16:40 +goltoof: 'whatever hiding means
16:41 +msparks: window new hidden makes a new window, instead of making a new container and putting a window in it
16:41 +msparks: easiest way is /window new split, /window stick REF, where REF is the number of the hilight window
16:41 +msparks: then /wc on the empty window
16:43 +msparks: wrong window.

17:32 +wart____: hi folks.  probably in a faq, but a quick glance at the man page and google didn't give me the answer.  I'm used to hitting C-n to switch to the next window (the next open #channel); but sometimes I'd like a list of te channels/windows i have opena nd the ability to select one from that list.
17:32 +wart____: is this possible in irssi?
17:33 +wart____: i know i can do Alt-# to jump direct to a given window; but I don't associate #channel names with those numbers.
17:33 +yitz_: Yes and no. /window list  will list all your windows. /window N   will jump to a window by number. /window goto #name  can just by name
17:33 +lewellyn: you can also /window move
17:33 +wart____: and i now i can do /window list and then /window goto # but i'd like a seleciton menu, i guess.
17:33 +yitz_: Some people will bind alt-i for #irssi etc
17:34 +yitz_: No interactive menu systems
17:34 +wart____: is there a way to get the [Act: 9,10, 12,16]  status bar item to rather list Act: #irssi, #gentoo, #foo] instead?
17:35 +wart____: or Act: 9:#irssi, #10:gentoo, #12:foo
17:35 +billnye: wart____: /toggle actlist_names
17:35 +wart____: ah perfect
17:35 +wart____: i think that will do what i want, although it'll probably "scroll" off the edge of my screen on this 8" netbook :p
17:36 +lewellyn: wart____: sounds like you're in few enough channels that may not be much of an issue ;)
17:36 +wart____: lewellyn: well i'm in 19
17:36 +Bazerka: you can /set actlist_sort level
17:36 +wart____: lewellyn: but yeah i'l try to keep it small :-)
17:36 +Bazerka: and the most important windows will appear on the left
17:36 +wart____: Bazerka: thaanks!
17:36 +lewellyn: wart____: i'm down to 203 windows again :)
17:36 +Bazerka: (based on hilights, activity, crap)
17:37 +yitz_: You can also play with the ack.pl script to get more intellegent channel selectors
17:37 * lewellyn tries to hover around 200
17:38 +wart____: thanks, gonna part now to keep my windows under control :-)
