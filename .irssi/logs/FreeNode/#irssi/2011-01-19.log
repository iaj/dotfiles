02:11 +Ziber: I've noticed a few things I don't like about hilighting in irssi, and am aiming to set up (via either a script or a source patch) that will auto-hilight me if my nickname is said in any channel, auto-checking aganist my nickname on that particular server. Any ideas?

02:42 +Ziber: billnye: the fact that, using the nickname "Liber" on most servers, I get hilighted by "liberal", "liberation", etc.
02:42 +billnye: Ziber: that's because you've told irssi you wanted that
02:42 +billnye: (by not telling it that liber had to be its own word)
02:42 +billnye: see -full
02:42 +billnye: /help hilight
02:43 +Ziber: I want auto-hilight, word-only, by my nickname at any given point per network, though.
02:44 +billnye: do you actually collide with your "other" nicks on the networks you don't use them?
02:45 +Ziber: Hm?
02:45 +billnye: put another way
02:46 +billnye: would there actually be negative side effects to /hilight -full mynick1  /hilight -full mynick2  /hilight -full mynick3
02:46 +Ziber: Not really, but how hard would my idea be to implement?
02:47 +billnye: it would, as you surmise, require a script or a source mod.
02:47 +billnye: if you're set on doing one of those things, by all means... but you did also say "any ideas" :)
02:48 +Ziber: Yes, I did, because I tend to have a way to find harder than necessary things to do this, and was wondering if there was a built in version (or an already completed script, perhaps, of my idea)
02:48 +billnye: "not that I'm aware of"
02:48 +billnye: /set hilight_nick_matches is on by default, but that's only start-of-line
02:48 +billnye: and conflicts with "real" hilights
02:48 +Ziber: Indeed, which is why I disabled that.
02:49 +Ziber: How, with a script, would I be able to print the text exactly in the format that its supposed to be in, but modify the level (adding MSGLEVEL_HILIGHT) if needed?
02:50 +billnye: I'll be not much help on the nitty gritty of the scripting side
02:51 +Omega: I'm in #math and get highlighted all the time :<
02:52 +billnye: Omega: easy fix if you're willing to sacrifice all hilights of Omega in that channel
02:54 +Omega: How?
02:55 +billnye: trigger.pl

16:44 +Koffa: wtf
16:44 +Koffa: I lost a window o,O
16:44 +Koffa: whathappen
16:46 +billnye: somebody set up you the /wc ?

16:47 +Rhonda: Koffa: Check wether you have stuff in your config related to a not-defined network. I seem to remember troubles of lost windows through that.
16:49 +xyblor: I'm using notify.pl - is there a way to prevent messages from certain nicks from triggering a notification?
16:50 --- Guest71180 is now known as RaNdY
16:50 +xyblor: I guess ignoring hilights from certain would work too

16:52 +tmr: trigger.pl works for latter.
16:56 +xyblor: tmr: okay thanks
16:57 +Koffa: it's a window that used to belong to a defined network but I'm not connected to it right now... haven't been for a month or so in fact, which makes it weird
