00:33 +znx: DrSlony: script called dns.pl
00:33 +DrSlony: where do i get it and how do i install it?
00:34 +billnye: google is a good place to start in any case, but chances are it'd lead you to http://scripts.irssi.org/
00:34 +znx: DrSlony: open a shell: cd ~/.irssi/scripts; wget http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/dns.pl; mkdir autorun; cd autorun; ln -s ../dns.pl     close shell
00:34 +znx: then: /script load dns

04:13 +Dirm: have you tried /window name?
04:13 +unicum: yes
04:13 +unicum: didn't do.. anything at all
04:13 +Dirm: what do you expect it to do?
04:14 +unicum: well.. to give the window the name i type after /window name
04:14 +Dirm: what do you expect giving a window a name to do?
04:14 +unicum: erm... this last question doesn't make sense to me
04:15 +Dirm: where do you expect the name to show up?
04:15 +unicum: advancedwindowlist.pl
04:16 +unicum: since i was just fooling around with irssi-xmpp

04:33 +n-iCe: hi
04:33 +n-iCe: is perl the only way to code irssi scripts?
04:33 +shabble: basically, yes
04:33 +Dirm: I think svn has an irssi-python module, or did at one point
04:34 +yitz_: There's a python branch
04:34 +yitz_: ^^
04:34 +n-iCe: any in here is a perl coder?
04:34 +shabble: ahf has some lua module as well
04:34 +shabble: dunno how well supported any of them are compared to perl tho, probably quite poorly
04:34 +mauke: n-iCe: ask your real question
04:35 +n-iCe: that's the real question, would like to know who codes, to share information, I really want to learn peal.
04:35 +yitz_: Try a Perl guide via #perl
04:35 +mauke: n-iCe: ok, then the answer is "yes, someone in here is a perl coder"
04:36 +shabble: you're probably better off learning perl separately, then writing irssi scripts
04:36 +shabble: than trying to do both at once
04:36 +shabble: try http://learn.perl.org/
04:36 +n-iCe: ok, I'm gonna start perl first
04:36 +mauke: oh yeah, free book and everything
04:37 +shabble: once you get the hang of things, there's the official irssi docs at irssi.org/documentation, and my version at http://shabble.github.com/irssi-scripts/docs/index.html
04:38 +n-iCe: :o
04:38 +mauke: shabble: â™¥
04:38 +mauke: shabble++
04:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Brownout_]
04:39 +shabble: mauke: :D you're welcome to a commit bit if you want to improve them :)
04:39 +mauke: but I lack time and knowledge
04:40 +shabble: don't we all :)
04:40 +unicum: anyone here familiar with trigger.pl?
04:40 +mauke: unicum: yes, someone is
04:41 +unicum: kk, fair point
04:41 +shabble: unicum: doing what with it?
04:41 +unicum: okay, so i created the following trigger
04:41 +unicum:  /trigger add -all -nocase -regexp  tequila -command 'msg -quakenet #wunderbar Random Tequila Hilight >> $C | $N - $M <<' -name Tequila
04:41 +unicum: interesting enough it gave me 2 (TWO) outputs on an action message, as shown in the following
04:42 +unicum: 04:39:22 < unicum> Random Tequila Hilight >> #wunderbar | wunderGast4 - ACTION haette gern eine buddel tequila <<
04:42 +unicum: 04:39:22 < unicum> Random Tequila Hilight >> #wunderbar | wunderGast4 - haette gern eine buddel tequila <<
04:42 +unicum: 04:39:22  * wunderGast4 haette gern eine buddel tequila
04:42 +mauke: yes, because actions are ctcp messages
04:43 +shabble: unicum: because it's triggering on the string 'tequila' in your msg to #wunderbar?
04:43 +mauke: and you registered your trigger for pubctcps and pubactions
04:43 +unicum: sooo.. i need to set some additional flags, i assume?
04:43 +unicum: like.. no pubctcps?
04:44 +mauke: I think you should stop using -all and list what you actually want to match
04:44 +msparks: shabble: that's a legitimate docs project. nice.
04:44 +unicum: mauke: i want ALL messages and/or actions containing 'tequila' ^^
04:45 +shabble: msparks: yeah, I haven't had time to play with it recently, but the basics are there
04:45 +shabble: and actually linking stuff toegether makes a big difference, I've found
04:45 +mauke: -publics,privmsgs,pubactions,privactions
04:45 +n-iCe: are there perl irc bots?
04:45 +shabble: many
04:45 +mauke: n-iCe: yes
04:46 +shabble: http://search.cpan.org/search?query=bot&mode=all
04:46 +unicum: mauke: i see.. and i suppose if i want pubactions and privactions shown as such i should create extra triggers for those, right?
04:46 +mauke: yeah, that's probably the easiest way
04:46 +unicum: cool, thx
04:46 +mauke: preflex: seen buubot
04:46 +preflex:  buubot was last seen on #perl 14 hours, 31 minutes and 29 seconds ago, saying: LeoNerd: No output.
04:48 +n-iCe: is my still used?
04:48 +shabble: your?
04:48 +mauke: what
04:48 +n-iCe: my @first_array;
04:48 +shabble: yes
04:48 +mauke: interpretation: [perl] is 'my' still used?
04:48 +mauke: n-iCe: what do you mean by "still"?
04:49 +n-iCe: because the tuto I'm reading explains it, but once I try to use it in my linux machine, says: ./test.pl: line 4: my: command not found
04:49 +unicum: oh.. by the way.. what's the difference between $M and $\M?
04:49 +mauke: run your perl programs with perl, not /bin/sh
04:49 +mauke: that helps
04:50 +mauke: unicum: $\X, with X being one of the above expands (e.g. $\M), escapes all non-alphanumeric characters, so it can be used with /eval or /exec.
04:50 +shabble: 'perl test.pl', or fix your shebang (#!/usr/bin/env perl) line
04:51 +n-iCe: ooh awesome
04:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
04:51 +unicum: hrmmm
04:52 +mauke: general advice: perl errors have the form "bla bla bla at file.pl line 42"
04:52 +mauke: so a message like "./test.pl: line 4: ..." can't be from perl
04:53 +mauke: also, perl messages are listed and explained in perldoc perldiag
04:53 +mauke: if you don't know perldoc, it's a command (and you should probably read perldoc perldoc and perldoc perl)
04:53 +shabble: 'use diagnostics' gives you most of that for free
04:53 +mauke: not "for free", it makes your program slower
04:53 +mauke: slower startup, and all your regexes will be slow
04:54 +mauke: ./test.pl 2>&1 | splain
04:54 +shabble: free in the not having to look it up sense, rather than the performance sense.
04:55 +mauke: if you don't know splain, perldoc splain :-)
04:55 +shabble: didn't know about the regex issue though. related to $& etc?
04:55 +mauke: shabble: yeah
04:55 +mauke: I think it's fixed in the latest version of diagnostics.pm
04:56 +shabble: also didn't know about splain :)
04:56 * shabble goes off to break something to test it
04:56 +shabble: neat
04:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v phyber]
04:57 +n-iCe: can perl be executed in windows?
04:57 * yitz_ didn't know splain or diagnostics
04:58 +shabble: n-iCe: yes. Not sure what the best package/whatever is for it these days though.
04:58 +mauke: people generally recommend strawberry perl
04:58 +yitz_: Shouldn't this all be in #perl? :P
04:58 +shabble: #perl-help, probably
04:59 +shabble: but it's not like there's any legitimate conversations going on that we're stomping on :)
04:59 +n-iCe: i'm very excited reading
04:59 * gryllida watches phyber's hostname
05:06 +mauke: #perl-help is another network
05:08  gryllida: It's #perl here on freenode.

14:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v janhouse]
14:15 +Bazerka: you don't - a timer isn't associated with any particular context
14:16 +Bazerka: so you need to use a method inside of the timer function to get whatever context you need
14:16 +Nei: or you pass on the data when creating the timer
14:17 +Bazerka: that's not a particular good idea, as that ref may have gone by the time the timer func is called
14:18 +Bazerka: well, for one of the *_RECs at least
14:18 +Nei: well, if the timer is created in a response to an event, this makes sense... but you might need to check if the target is already gone if you want to be clean, I guess
14:18 +Bazerka: for plain old scalars, it would be fine
14:19 +Bazerka: er
14:19 +Bazerka: that's not what I meant to say - any non *_REC variable
14:20 +shabble: ie: $msg, $nick, $addr, but not target or server.
14:20 +shabble: you can still pass them (or store them in globals), but you'll need to check their integrity in your timeout handler.
14:20 +shabble: or get $server->{tag} and look it up again later.
14:21 +Bazerka: getting a new context inside the function is typically the way I'd personally do it
14:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
14:22 +Bazerka: but as with anything perl - TMTOWTDI :)
14:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v skonek]
14:22 +shabble: Bazerka: save tag and then server_find_tag()?
14:23 +Bazerka: well, it depends on what data you need in the function, but yeah, that kinda of approach I guess
14:23 +shabble: that reminds me, I need to move all the foo_find_bar functions into the main irssi.pod docs.
14:23 +Bazerka: as that would cover the case of having a reconnect between initiating the timer and it firing, eg

14:35 +SlownyZabujca: Hi
14:35 +SlownyZabujca: Quick question: is there any way to change separator char?
14:35 +shabble: that separates what?
14:36 +SlownyZabujca: By separator I mean coma
14:36 +jink: That separates what?
14:36 +SlownyZabujca: separates activated windows
14:36 +jink: Provide context, like what you want to do, and why.
14:36 +Babar: Act bar I guess
14:36 +jink: Ah, the [Act: 1,2,3] thing?
14:36 +SlownyZabujca: Yup
14:36 +shabble: SlownyZabujca: in the active windows statusbaritem?
14:36 +SlownyZabujca: yes
14:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v boliveira]
14:37 +Babar: sb_act_sep and sb_act_text I guess
14:37 +Babar: the %c must be a comma
14:37 +FoxMaSk: Bazerka: when  you say "so you need to use a method inside of the timer function to get whatever context" you mean with an Irssi:: one or a homemade ?
14:38 +jink: Babar: I don't have those. :(
14:38 +Babar: jink: in your theme
14:38 +Bazerka: I'm talking about an irssi method that returns whatever *_REC you're looking for
14:38 +jink: Ah, awesome. :)
14:38 +Babar: oh no, %c is cyan
14:39 +Babar: so... hum...
14:39 +Babar:   # ',' separator
14:39 +Babar:   sb_act_sep = "%c$*";
14:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axius]
14:40 +Babar: so I guess just put the color you want then the char you want, so for a green caret, that would be: "%g-"
14:40 +boliveira: q
14:40 +Babar: (untested)
14:40 +jink: Babar: Just the style for the comma, nothing else.
14:40 +Bazerka: sometimes it's unavoidable having to use a global or passing the ref in via the timer_add* args
14:40 +Nei: $* is the comma, you can replace it with something else
14:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axius]
14:40 +Bazerka: but if you do that, you have to ensure that the ref is still valid before trying to use it
14:40 +jink: Ah, fair enough. :)
14:41 +SlownyZabujca: Well, the easiest way would be Nei's way I think
14:41 +SlownyZabujca: I'll change $* to my char :}
14:41 +jink: That's Babar's way, with Nei's explanation. ;)
14:41 +shabble: SlownyZabujca: yeah, that works
14:42 +Babar: Nei's way? Ok. Next time I won't bother helping.
14:42 +jink: Babar: Tsssk. :)
14:42 +SlownyZabujca: Babar: forgive me :D
14:42 * shabble was a bit slow in digging out statusbar-items.c
14:42 +SlownyZabujca: Yoursyours way as well
14:42 +shabble: it's where the magic happens(tm)!
14:42 +SlownyZabujca: all of you :>

14:53 +Babar: shabble: I just grep'ed the default theme, much faster :)
14:53 +shabble: Babar: yeah, I saw it in the theme, but couldn't figure out where the comma was coming from without further investigation :)
14:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v wallbunny]
14:57 +Babar: it's written in the comments :)
14:57 +Babar: at least, that's what I assumed :)
14:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisB1y]
14:57 +Babar: so I came to the same conclusion as Nei. Not sure Nei guessed or checked :) (I guessed)
14:58 +shabble: I'm not sure why it goes to the trouble of '  sb_act_sep = "%c$*";
14:58 +shabble: 			value = theme_format_expand(theme, "{sb_act_sep ,}");
14:58 +shabble: hrmpf, I thought I was strippign tabs
15:00 +FoxMaSk: Bazerka: so if i trigger the timeout_add on the join event in my 'foobar' that will do the trick ?
15:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sud0]
15:12 +FoxMaSk: ok that working like that
15:12 +FoxMaSk: on join i trigger the timer

16:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v coldhak]
16:45 +wwalker: what do I read up on to do that in irssi?  I know how to turn the messages off, but that's not what I want.

17:46 +edavis: And yet it doesn't show me the message. Is there a command that I need to use to set this?
17:46 +edavis: When I used irssi on my linux server, it showed the messages
17:47 +billnye: anything amiss in your /set away ?
17:47 +tmr: edavis, are you using cygwin irssi or the obsolete build from irssi.org?
17:47 +edavis: cygwin
17:50 +edavis: tmr: would I be better off with something different?
17:50 +tmr: No, not with Windows.
17:50 +edavis: So is there nothing I can do?
17:51 +edavis: I had a Linux VPS just so I could use irssi, haha. And now I got rid of that and I don't want to go back to mIRC :(
17:52 +tmr: You should check Bill's suggestion.
17:52 +edavis: I "checked" his suggestion and nothing seems off and I don't see the option of "show_awaylog" ;)

18:02 +znx: chka: what i mean .. use your terminal?!
18:03 +znx: for instance .. gnome-terminal will underline when you mouseover
18:04 +chka: I use putty, it underlines just as gnome-terminal. But mouseover isn't highlight now is it?
18:04 +chka: And I was asking for irssi...
18:04 +edavis: Try using PuTTY Tray

18:04 +delt: Hello

18:04 +chka: Yes you can or No sorry you can't....
18:05 +delt: irssi is not compatible with "killall -11 irssi" ...causes a segfault
18:05 +delt: =)
18:05 +spb: delt is not compatible with being shot in the face. causes death.
18:05 +edavis: chka: that's not an irssi issue is what he's telling you. It has *nothing* to do with irssi
18:05 +edavis: It has to do with your terminal
18:06 +spb: chka: irssi displays text on a terminal. if you want anything to be highlighted or clickable that's your terminal's job
18:06 +chka: Highlight = specific color or font style. It has everything to do with irssi.
18:06 +chka: Not clickable, highlighted.
18:06 +spb: if you just want it to change colour then you can script that
18:06 +delt: hehe spb =) "warning: do not drive or operate machinery if drowsiness or death occurs"
18:07 +chka: spb: How?
18:08 +edavis: 12:07:55 -!- Irssi: 2 new messages in awaylog: 12:07:55 -!- Irssi: No such file or directory
18:08 +edavis: How does it know I have 2 messages if it can't even read the file?
18:16 +delt: oh, how do i "move" a window from being the last to being the second? (like, i closed it by accident, and rejoined the channel)
18:16 +edavis: /win move target
18:16 +edavis: So go to the win you want to move, and type /win move 2
18:16 +delt: ah thanks got it!
18:16 +edavis: Np :)
18:17 +delt: oh nice favicon.ico btw =)
18:17 +delt: (on schsimtracker.org)
18:17 +znx: you can also /win move left  .. or right
18:17 +znx: or up .. or down
18:18 +delt: uh oops sorry wrong window :/
