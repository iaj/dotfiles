16:29 +Koffa: weird prob... two users which have set nonblock 5 on screen and are using screen -DRR end up having irssi hang once in a while
16:29 +Koffa: any other thingamalingies to check?

16:31 +shabble: although I think nonblock should take care of that

17:14 +_NiC: Evening. Is there an easy way to set up a notification in the status-bar (similar to channels changing colors when someone talks in them) for when I receive messages?
17:14 +_NiC: I have a separate always-visible window for msgs.
17:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v explore]
17:19 +deryni: You want notification in your statusbar for new messages in a window you can already see?
17:19 +_NiC: deryni, yes, because most of the time only the bottom part of my terminalwindow is visible
17:20 +_NiC: that way I would only need a few lines being visible to catch everything when it happens
17:22 +deryni: Personally I'd probably just hide the msgs window but a script should be able to do what you want.
17:27 +_NiC: hm.. yeah. I'll look through the script-list and see if I can hack something together.
17:27 +_NiC: Seems to be alot of scripts dealing with the statusbar in different ways.

18:02 +billnye: _NiC: just sort PMs to the start of the [Act: ] ?
18:02 +billnye: (is that different in some significant way from what you're trying to ask for?)
18:03 +deryni: The window is visible that seems to prevent act triggering.
18:04 +billnye: oh. then "why on earth is the window visible if you're not looking at it", yes :D
18:04 +deryni: Heh.
18:05 +billnye: make your "separate always visible window" a hilightwin instead, and have a hidden msgs window, the end.
18:05 +billnye: (of my suggestion ;D )

18:13 +peth: i let irssi beep me on highlight and enable the term's bell urgency. added benefit: you can see that from another workspace/tag if your wm behaves sanely.
18:13 +peth: i know you were just dying to know how i do it
18:15 +Pieter: not really
18:16 +peth: i meant the other guy. the one who was dying to know how i do it.

18:47 +deryni: Does /beep work? Are you using screen?
18:48 +bremner:  /beep doesn't seem to work. No screen.
18:49 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 135 seconds
18:49 +bremner: probably a terminal config problem
18:52 +bremner: well it certainly works in xterm.
18:53 +deryni: Sounds like you have beeping off in urxvt then.
18:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Plasmastar]
18:56 +bremner: yeah, that was it. At least visual bell works. I'll have to sort out urgency later.
18:57 +peth: xresource is urgentOnBell
18:58 +bremner: right. I suspect my xmonad config needs to be modified.
