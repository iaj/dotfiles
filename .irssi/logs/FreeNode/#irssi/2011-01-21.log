19:24 +iaj: can someone tell me what I may do in order to get my colors on my remote irssi (sshed) working?
19:24 +OkweL: colors?
19:25 +OkweL: /set colors on
19:25 +lestat: maybe enable colors in your terminal first
19:25 +iaj: OkweL: im using screen, and have a window logged into an ssh session of a debian machine
19:26 +iaj: $TERM is screen-256color... however when I go to irssi on that remote end
19:26 +iaj: the blue looksl ike purp :\
19:26 +iaj: the default blue is a bright purple and all colors are different from what they should be
19:26 +iaj: locally run - theres no problem on irssi.
19:27 +iaj: this one is driving me mad.. using iTerm on OSX.... do I have to mess with termcap terminfo?  Or what's the problem..
19:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pankajm]
19:30 +deryni: You ssh to the machine then attach to screen-running-irssi?
19:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v blip2]
19:31 +iaj: yeah.. well that's  what I want to do
19:31 +iaj: if all goes smooth
19:32 +iaj: currently I just ssh into machine launch irssi on the running session, and create a screen session and run it there
19:32 +iaj: doesn't matter
19:32 +jink: I did:   alias i='/usr/bin/screen -UdRS irssi /usr/bin/irssi'
19:33 +jink: Then you can just run "i" and it'll either attach to irssi, or create a new screen with irssi. :)
19:33 +iaj: yeh that's nice :)
19:33 +iaj: Hmmm.. I'm wondering.. its the ANSI of my iTerm
19:33 +deryni: That won't run irssi a second time when attaching?
19:33 +iaj: Thats causing the problem
19:33 +jink: deryni: No, it won't. :)
19:33 +deryni: Nice.
19:33 +iaj: I'll put that line into my .zshrc
19:33 +iaj: :-)
19:34 +jink: -d -R   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
19:36 +jink: -R   attempts to resume the youngest (in terms of creation time) detached screen session it finds.  If successful, all other command-line options are ignored.  If no detached session exists, starts  a  new  session using the specified options, just as if -R had not been specified.
19:36 +jink: deryni: Those are from "man screen"
19:38 +deryni: What version of screen is that from? Also that's confusing unless order of d/R matters.
19:39 +jink: Erhm, it from erhm...
19:39 +jink: Screen version 4.00.03jw4 (FAU) 2-May-06
19:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v al3x]
19:40 +jink: deryni: I don't think the actual order matters.  The -d -R is just in the manual to show the power of combining options.
19:40 +deryni: Ah, I hadn't gone down as far as bare -R in my man page.
19:40 +deryni: Yes, but -R says it ignores other arguments.
19:40 +jink: ^__^
19:41 --- Guest45218 is now known as RaNdY
19:41 --- RaNdY is now known as Guest21702
19:41 +deryni: So -d -R can't work unless order matters or the info for -R is incorrect.
19:41 +jink: I read that as the [cmd [args]] part:  screen [ -options ] [ cmd [ args ] ]
19:41 +deryni: It says 'command-line options'.
19:41 +jink: I agree.
19:42 +jink: I'm just saying that I use the above to create a named session, and that works.
19:42 +jink: There is a screen on:
19:42 +jink:         2826.irssi      (12/17/2010 06:28:55 PM)        (Attached)
19:42 +deryni: Understood. I wasn't questioning that it worked, more wondering how/why it works exactly.
19:44 +jink: -R doesn't run the command with optional args if it can successfully attach.  I agree they probably should've made that more clear.

20:23 +iaj: Ok figured.
20:24 +iaj: So now here comes the task: I've set up my iTerm to use a specific ANSI palette for showing red,yellow etc. in other colors - this goes perfectly with my xchat2 theme on irssi as well - so now - when I log into my ssh and start irssi there - it looks TOTALLY different - is there any fix to that?
20:26 +deryni: It works with irssi run locally but not with irssi run on the other machine?

20:32 +iaj: I don't know why the local one ain't sticking to the term colors.
20:32 +iaj: iTerm specified colors*
20:32 +iaj: But it works .. I changed those because of my prompt... damn... what do I do now
20:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v supercosmonaut]
20:35 +deryni: Wait, the local irssi is using the "wrong" colors?
20:36 +billnye: iaj: presumably the method being used to launch the two terminals
20:37 +iaj: Not the iTerm specified ones deryni yeah
20:37 +billnye: 'smy best guess anyway... 16 colors is 16 colors is 16 colors.
20:37 +iaj: billnye: I want to avoid that since I run everything in screen here
20:37 +deryni: The same iterm instance displays the wrong colors locally but the right colors when you ssh to a different machine?
20:39 +billnye: I think deryni is trying to ask what I'm wondering... fire up an iTerm, launch local irssi, close local irssi, ssh to remote, launch irssi remote (all in the SAME iTerm) and you get different colors?
20:39 +iaj_: well, it uses the - correct ones as it would look in the screen on the irssi theme page - but I changed my ANSI colors for having a different colored prompt - and irssi didn't care about it.
20:40 +billnye: "different color prompt"?
20:40 +iaj_: my nick is red instead of the bold white, for example that's the most annoying issue
20:40 +iaj_: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/
20:40 +iaj_: ^ billnye   I used those ANSI colors as the guy specified.
20:41 --- Guest21702 is now known as RaNdY
20:41 +billnye: well did you reassign "bold white" to display as something else?
20:42 --- RaNdY is now known as Guest49845
20:42 +billnye: you can't theme the 16 ansi colors to something else, and then expect them to simultaneously be another set of colors
20:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pankajm]
20:44 +billnye: yes? no? maybe so?
20:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pankajm]
20:45 +iaj_: you shall highlight my nick :)
20:46 +iaj_: uhhh. bold white.. the color that's being used here dunno if its theme specific - is bold red
20:46 +iaj_: eg. the ansi color from iterm for bold rd
20:46 +iaj_: but its bold white displayed locally ( but I guess its locally wrong )
20:47 +iaj_: so I think a first step would be to assign a white to the theme im using for my own nick
20:47 +iaj_: but I dunno which setting that is.
20:48 +billnye: iaj: I haven't made 100% sense of your situation yet, but I think the biggest thing for you to understand is that "change the display color for ansi color X" is going to affect every program in that terminal
20:49 +iaj_: billnye: I thought so as well - THO irssi seems different.. at least the bold white ( my own nick ) is displayed differently
20:49 +billnye: beyond that advice, I haven't divined an irssi question in your situation
20:49 +iaj_: :-)
20:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pankajm]
20:49 +billnye: iaj_: within the same exact iTerm session, same exact irssi theme file?
20:50 +iaj_: billnye: yup!
20:51 +billnye: you linked to http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/, but you meant http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/03/candy-colored-terminal/, yes?
20:51 +deryni: Grab one of those terminal color tester/printer scripts and run it locally and remotely. If that doesn't show the difference then I'd double check your irssi theme.
20:53 +billnye: something that outputs http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-tip-prompt/colortable.gif
20:53 +billnye: (...ish)
20:56 +iaj_: i got something like that
20:56 +iaj_: a perl script
20:56 +iaj_: one second
20:57 +billnye: if I'm understanding your issue and your setup, I'd try it local/remote-bare/remote-in-screen
20:58 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ikonia]
20:58 +iaj_: Im for now trying it only in screen.. both in a screen session
20:58 +iaj_: the colors from colortest.pl are identical on both ends.
20:58 +iaj_: for example if I use /set theme default locally - I get the default blue bar at the bottom
20:59 +iaj_: on the ssh side if I do /set theme default its (las its acutally defined as blue more magentaish)
20:59 +iaj_: s/(las/as/
20:59 +billnye: that fix didn't let me parse successfully :D
21:00 +billnye: "on the ssh side if I do /set theme default it's actually defined as more magenta-ish"?
21:00 +iaj_: well the blue bar at the bottom - its purple/magenta - its not blue :D
21:01 +iaj_: and that way its defined in my iTerm's prefs as well... actually I dunno why it even works locally...
21:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v al3x]
21:01 +billnye: I'm at work, and you're still not making enough sense for me
21:02 +billnye: so I'm going to respectfully withdraw for now
21:02 +deryni: Maybe screenshots would help?
21:02 +billnye: I hope somebody else can help you out, but I still don't think you have an irssi issue
21:03 +iaj: im gonna make some screens:)
21:04 +iaj: with theme = default
21:06 +iaj_: im iaj_ here.. fyi.. ;)
21:09 +iaj: ok here I go LOCAL ONE: https://skitch.com/iiaj/rk17j/default    REMOTE ONE: https://skitch.com/iiaj/rk173/default     just look at the iaj speaking (once in white - once in bold red) i need that to be fixed - since I'm only using that theme anyhow
21:19 +deryni: Are you using iaj_ from the remote machine every time?
21:19 +iaj: deryni: huh? iaj_ was the remote man.. yeah
21:19 +iaj: why you asking?
21:20 +iaj: on the remote machine when I speak its bold red
21:20 +iaj: and normally (locally) its white
21:20 +deryni: I'm wondering if the nickcolor script is the problem.
21:20 +iaj: that's what I basically want to fix
21:20 +iaj: its in queries as well =(
21:20 +deryni: Oh, hm.
21:20 +iaj: and I think nickcolor is just changing other peoples nickname colors, no?
21:21 +deryni: I think so, I was just wondering. Check what /format says for ownmsg on both machines?
21:23 +iaj: own_msg = "{ownmsgnick $2 {ownnick $0}}$1";   locally
21:23 +iaj_:  own_msg = "{ownmsgnick $2 {ownnick $0}}$1";  remotely - the same
21:24 +billnye: now trace back the two expandos there
21:24 +iaj_: own_msg_channel is the same
21:25 +iaj_: hu?
21:25 +billnye: compare ownmsgnick and ownnick too
21:25 +billnye: I don't remember which do what, otherwise it might be just "compare one of those" instead
21:26 +iaj: ah now I get what you mean
21:27 +iaj: however /format ownmsgnick is empty
21:27 +iaj: e.g. i don't get anything out of it
21:27 +iaj_: on both sides
21:27 +mauke: s/e\.g\./i.e./
21:27 +iaj_: sorry :)
21:28 +billnye: iaj_: in the theme
21:28 +billnye: (s)
21:29 +iaj: billnye: oh... hmmm the themes.. i just zipped it locally and upped it to the server
21:29 +iaj: so they have to be the same
21:30 +iaj: but billnye I saw some theme - where the white was working (angelic4)  may I just use the colordefinition from there?
21:30 +sedeki: i've installed irssi scripts via apt-get. which are these and how do i try them out? anyone familiar with them?
21:31 +iaj: sedeki: in $HOME/.irssi afaik... just use /set theme themename
21:31 +iaj: in irssi to use them
21:31 +Death4Li1e: they are in /usr/share/irssi/scripts/
21:31 +Death4Li1e: and you can load them with /script load
21:31 +billnye: iaj: once you start running nickcolor and stuff, the themes AREN'T guaranteed "to be the same"
21:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Geralt]
21:33 +iaj: billnye: but if its the exact SAME configuration?
21:33 +billnye: I'm saying don't assume across the variables you've introduced
21:33 +billnye: that's all
21:34 +deryni: nickcolor changes your theme/formats based on the nicks it has seen.
21:34 +billnye: hence a variable, and one that's theme-related
21:35 +iaj: nickcolor is only responsible for OTHER nicks, isn't it?
21:35 +iaj: but yeh.. thanks... ill take that into consideration
21:35 +billnye: iaj: I don't know that for sure... do you know that for sure?
21:35 +billnye: you may not find that it's different, but it's worth checking it out fully instead of assuming
21:35 +iaj: billnye: ofc not :)
21:36 +billnye: troubleshooting is the art of EXHAUSTIVELY eliminating all possibilities until you encounter the truth :)
21:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mica_moca]
21:36 +iaj: hehe... sorry about that... but I just checked both theme files
21:36 +iaj: Identical
21:38 +billnye: good... now we know instead of assuming :)
21:39 +sedeki: anypne know how to set the background color of a xterm window (running)
21:40 +iaj: billnye: do you know about themes in irssi?
21:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sedeki]
21:40 +billnye: I don't know enough about that question to answer it ;P
21:41 +iaj: :-)
21:41 +billnye: iaj: ask your question, and either it'll get answered or it won't, but either way it'll have a better chance than now :D
21:42 +iaj: Normally would I /set theme <theme I want something to find out>   then /format ownnick   for example... or simply own... and then look for... well.. what's the channel own msg thing?
21:42 --- Guest49845 is now known as RaNdY
21:42 +iaj: own_msg_channel?
21:42 +billnye: sedeki: .Xresources maybe?
21:42 --- RaNdY is now known as Guest491
21:42 +billnye: sedeki: I don't know which options are "live" and which are "next time"
21:42 +iaj: or own_msg ?   this is confusing :)
21:43 +sedeki: i only have .Xdefaults
21:44 +billnye: iaj: it's easiest to trace that stuff with a theme that's behaving how you expect
21:44 +iaj: for now I just need to accustome myself a bit with how those things work... :)
21:44 +sedeki: does xterm handle transparancy? i have a composite manager (cairo-compmgr)
21:44 +billnye: default.theme is pretty well commented, but it's still a bit of a brainscramble to sort through even so
21:45 +iaj: billnye: for example is there globally a variable for storing the stuff that's showing up when I write something?
21:45 +billnye: for /storing/ it?
21:45 +iaj: so I'd compare those 2 elements
21:45 +billnye: I'm not sure what you're asking
21:46 +iaj: sniff.. in the one its displayed red.. in the other theme its displayed white -- just want to compare those 2, and then accustom the red with the white one :)

21:48 +Stand_Alone_Comp: is there any way to make those Meta-whatever keys to have more than o-key to change windows?
21:48 +Stand_Alone_Comp: (having suppose lots of bindings of that)
21:49 +billnye: Stand_Alone_Comp: there's a "paste this in" that will use all 4 rows, and there are other options that won't clobber the other meta-stuff binds

21:54 +billnye: hmm?

21:56 +Datz: heh
21:56 +Datz: er you get it, but not the best way to put it..
21:56 +billnye: this is why it's important to have your servers/networks/channels properly configured in irssi :)
21:57 +billnye: so irssi can know that server.net.com and irc.net.com are both in the NET network :)
21:57 +Datz: yea, well I thought one was down, so I connected to another
21:57 +Datz: didn't work as you might have suspected
21:57 +Datz: ok, well, is there a way to merge everything?
21:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SpitfireWP]
