00:54 +diller: hey, do anyone know how i can log a single channel in irssi?
00:54 +kbar: how would i go about hiding the join/part messages?
00:55 +diller: in ~/.irssi/config
00:55 +Dirm: kbar: do you want them to disappear entirely, or still appear in the window, but not trigger the activity indicator in the statusbar?
00:55 +kbar: disappear
00:55 +Dirm: diller: /help log
00:55 +kbar: completely
00:55 +Dirm: kbar: /ignore * JOINS PARTS
00:55 +kbar: ok thanks bud
00:55 +Dirm: kbar: you probably also want QUITS, and maybe some others; see /help levels
00:56 +diller: "/ignore -channels #chan1,#chan2,#chan3 * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS"
00:56 +kbar: thanks guys
00:57 +diller: Dirm: and you understod that yourself the first time?
00:57 +diller: i have done that + googling
00:57 +Dirm: which part don't you understand?
00:57 +diller: 3rd option: go here
00:57 +Dirm: seems like you could pretty much copy/paste one of the examples
00:57 +diller: how to log a single channel
00:59 +diller: "/help log" is about as helpfull as throwing a arabic dict to you and ask you to speak it
00:59 +Dirm: not really
00:59 +diller: yes really
00:59 +diller: you just forgot cuz you got used to it
00:59 +Dirm: it uses pretty standard idioms that are common to most unix programs
00:59 +Dirm: many people in here have encountered them in other programs
01:00 +Dirm: if there are specific things you don't understand, you could ask about them
01:00 +diller: hehe irssi should aim at unix then, not linux :)
01:00 +diller: i did
01:00 +Dirm: and what is wrong with the example at the bottom of the help?
01:00 +diller: and i got a "help log"
01:00 +diller: 02:57 Irssi commands: 02:57 log close log open log start log stop
01:00 +diller: this ?
01:01 +Dirm: a bit up from that
01:01 +Dirm: under where it says "Examples:
01:01 +Dirm: "
01:01 +Dirm: whoops, gotta run for a bit
01:01 +diller: so i go to the channel and type /window log ?
01:01 +FauxFaux: Or read the docs.
01:02 +diller: not in a mood for this.. gonna use another client instead

02:09 +CIA-58: jdick * r5196 /contrib/w32installer/ (8 files in 4 dirs): Initial commit for 0.8.15 update
02:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Giant81_]
02:16 +Giant81_: I have a quick question, maybe I'm doing something wrong
02:16 +Giant81_: I can alt-# to get to any window accept 1 (status)
02:16 +Giant81_: that I can get to with either esc-1 or /window 1
02:17 +Giant81_: I'm running on lubuntu 10.10
02:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Giant81_]
02:27 +FauxFaux: Giant81_: Normally these things are termianl issues.
02:28 +Giant81_: that could certainly be, I'm on LXTerminal in lubuntu,
02:28 +Giant81_: i've used irssi in other terminals without issue
02:33 +Dirm: Giant81_: yeah, I'm guessing you're running a terminal that supports tabs, and uses alt+# to go to different tabs
02:34 +Dirm: but since you only have one tab, it's only intercepting alt+1
02:34 +Giant81_: that is probably exactly it, let me test by adding another tab
02:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rtl]
02:35 +Giant81_: bingo
02:35 +rtl: How do I stop irssi from sending mode/who/unban on join?
02:35 +Giant81_: isn't it /ignore * MODES
02:35 +Dirm: rtl: I think that's /set channel_sync off
02:36 +rtl: Dirm: tnx
02:36 +Dirm: there's also channel_max_who_sync
02:36 +Dirm: which you can use to stop it just on large chans
02:36 +rtl: I think my prob is quantity; 20ish chans, I get 'excess flood' every time I reattach to dircproxy
02:37 +Dirm: so you're starting and stopping irssi and running dircproxy on a server rather than just running irssi in screen on the server?
02:37 +Dirm: or someone else is running the proxy?
02:38 +rtl: Dirm: the former... I kinda like a more purpose built daemon for long running stuff like this
02:38 +Dirm: fair enough
02:39 +Dirm: I don't like dealing with restarting irssi

03:37 +catsup: how much would you pay for that?
03:38 +catsup: Giant81_: hilite
03:39 +shabble: is amazon AWS still doing the free micro instance thing? That would probably run irssi fine

04:50 +Iceman_B: how do I connec to a different host that belongs to an already defined network?
04:50 +Iceman_B: like I defined network Foo with host irc.foo.com
04:50 +Iceman_B: now I want to manually connect to Foo, but using irc.bar.com
04:50 +yitz_: You define a network. Then add server(s) to that network
04:50 +Iceman_B: o
04:50 +Iceman_B: :/
04:50 +Iceman_B: okay
04:50 +Iceman_B: not having this option seems...dumb though
04:51 +yitz_: /connect -network <network> <address>
04:52 +Iceman_B: I tried that, but that errored
04:52 +Iceman_B: I NEED to define <address>  beforehand?
04:52 +yitz_: address would be like irc.bar.com
04:53 +Iceman_B: Cannot assign requested address: <iphere>
04:54 +yitz_: Are you entering the < and > as well?
04:54 +Iceman_B: no
04:54 +Iceman_B: if I try /connect <ip> it doesnt error btw
04:54 +Iceman_B: (it times out though)
04:55 +deryni: "Cannot assign ..." means you /set hostname to something you shouldn't have. Unset it.
04:56 +billnye: Iceman_B: once you have multiple servers assigned to a network, and one of them set to -auto, then irssi will automatically fall back to others in the network if the first fails
04:57 +billnye: Iceman_B: but you can manually choose a different one with /connect 2nd.server.name instead of /connect network
04:57 +Iceman_B: hm
04:57 +Iceman_B: lets try that
04:57 +billnye: if the additional servers haven't been pre-added to the network, you will lose out on all your settings and autos
04:58 +Iceman_B: k
04:58 +billnye: so as yitz_ says, that's always the best first step
04:58 +Iceman_B: well I just did /server add -network <name> a few times
04:58 +Iceman_B: each with a different server
04:58 +Iceman_B: so that should be fine, right ?
04:59 +billnye: assuming they really are all on the same network, yes
05:00 +Iceman_B: according to their website, they are
05:00 +billnye: we haven't actually changed subjects, have we? O:)
05:01 +billnye: Iceman_/b/
05:01 +Iceman_B: hm?
05:01 +Iceman_B: no
05:01 +Iceman_B: im fiddling with servers =)
05:02 +billnye: just making a guess at your reason
05:02 +Iceman_B: hokay
05:02 +billnye: putting 2 and 2, as it were
05:02 +Iceman_B: and why would you make that particular guess?

05:06 +Iceman_B: Giant81_: just build a simply pc for like 100 euros and install linux on it

17:27 --- Slizzurd` is now known as Slizzurd
17:28 +cnl: irrsi treats symbol $ in config file as variable prefix. Value of variable autoidentcmd is a string with password. My password has symbol $ in it and irssi treats it like a variable, so some part of my passwords doesn't sends to server. How can I screen $ symbol to avoid irssi to treat it like a variable?
17:28 +imMute: cnl: did you add it to the config file by hand?
17:29 +cnl: nope
17:29 +Death4Life: or change your password?
17:29 +cnl: nope
17:29 +cnl: I added it by /set
17:29 +cnl: and then /save
17:29 +__monty__: cnl Can't you use an escape '\'
17:29 +imMute: you mean /network add   ?
17:29 +imMute: or is it /server add
17:29 +cnl: yep, /network add
17:29 +cnl: __monty__, I tried
17:30 +imMute: cnl: hmm, I'd say change your password so it doesn't contain a $
17:30 +znx: can i suggest not using $ in your password .. problem so... damn you imMute !
17:30 +znx: haha
17:30 +cnl: imMute, bad solution
17:30 +znx: not "bad" ..
17:30 +Death4Life: but a simple and effictive one :p
17:30 +znx: correct
17:31 +imMute: cnl: well, the alternative seems to be patching irssi
17:31 +cnl: hmm... ok, thanks
17:31 +__monty__: cnl Have you tried double quotes " ?
17:31 +cnl: __monty__, it uses double quotes by default
17:31 +imMute: __monty__: 1) don't advise editing the config file by hand   2) ... what cn1 just said.
17:31 +cnl: single quotes doesn't help
17:32 +__monty__: imMute Why shouldn't the config file be edited by hand?
17:32 +imMute: __monty__: because it's prone to breakage in weird and unexpected ways
17:33 +imMute: you *can*, but don't think most people here will help you when it breaks.
17:33 +__monty__: imMute And nobody cares enough to change that?
17:33 +imMute: __monty__: change what?  the config file format?
17:33 +imMute: no, mainly because it IS fairly .. "standard" and anything you can accomplish by editing the config you can accomplish by using /commands
17:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SpitfireWP_]
17:34 +__monty__: imMute Then how come it's prone to breaking? Something must be wonky somewhere.
17:35 +imMute: __monty__: by breaking I mean the user put something in it that the parser doesn't like
17:35 +znx: __monty__: prone to breaking when *you* do it by hand
17:35 +imMute: the parser will ALWAYS parse what /save outputs
17:35 +__monty__: znx I understood that.
17:35 +znx: yeah its the parser that's "at fault" ..
17:36 +billnye: cnl: try putting a double dollar in the password instead of a single
17:36 +__monty__: Than why doesn't anyone rewrite the parser to be more robust and just ignore something for a default value when a line doesn't make sense.
17:37 +billnye: __monty__: have at it ;D
17:37 +znx: "anymore" .. why not you then!
17:37 +znx: always the best response to those q's ;-)
17:39 +cnl: billnye, yep, it works. thank you
17:40 +__monty__: billnye, znx: I might try if I could but I don't think I'm capable of writing a good parser, heck I don't even know C.
17:41 +znx: oh well
17:41 +znx: thats probably why "anyone" doesnt fix it .. eh?
17:41 +billnye: cnl: \o/
17:41 +znx: because the people that want it fixed .. arent coders :P
17:41 +__monty__: Does anyone know of a way to indent all messages to the same level.
17:41 +imMute: and the people who are.. are working on irssi2  or have a life
17:42 +znx: __monty__: you can right align stuff .. check out some of the themes that do it
17:42 --- Weust` is now known as Weust`afk
17:42 +billnye: __monty__: there are preset themes, or check out the http://irssi.org/documentation/tips
17:42 +__monty__: imMute, znx: I don't think that patching the parser for this would take a lot of work, I might be wrong however.
17:42 +znx: you would be wrong
17:43 +znx: because you dont know C ..
17:44 +__monty__: znx, billnye: Could you link to a theme that does this? I can't find one. (I'm searching the tips.)
17:44 +__monty__: znx: Not knowing C has nothing to do with being wright or rong.
17:44 +imMute: __monty__: it would actually. and it's a low priority thing because as I said, editing the config is not necessary
17:44 +znx: __monty__: tips .. "right aligned nicks"
17:45 +__monty__: znx: Thanks.
17:45 +znx: __monty__: well ..its like saying "i dont know how to raise a building .. but it will only take one man and a week to complete"
17:45 +__monty__: znx: That's pretty much how Rome was built.
17:45 +znx: ha
17:46 +__monty__: znx: Do I manually paste these format lines in the config file?
17:47 +znx: __monty__: no those are commands ..
17:47 +znx: c+p into a running irssi
17:47 +znx: you can alter the [-9] for spacing
17:48 +__monty__: znx: Do I need to restart irssi for it to take effect?
17:49 +znx: no
17:49 +billnye: __monty__: no, but it won't change old lines either
17:49 +billnye: I /would/ make a copy of your current theme before entering the commands though
17:49 +znx: also it wont change some script output either
17:49 +billnye: (or soon after)
17:49 +znx: billnye: the theme file wont change .. you can always just reload it?
17:50 +__monty__: Ok, thank you very much kind sirs. (Not using a theme)
17:51 +__monty__: Is it possible to align text this way but still left-align nicks?
17:51 +billnye: znx: will on /save, won't it?
17:52 +billnye: __monty__: you're using default.theme if you haven't changed, my suggestion is creating a back-up default.theme
17:52 +billnye: __monty__: see http://irssi.org/documentation/formats for info on how that tip is doing its magic, and adjust as needed
17:52 +znx: the theme is stored in /usr/share/irssi/themes/ ..
17:52 +znx: no need to backup :)
17:53 +billnye: znx: I'm not implying it'd get lost if he didn't, but that he might want to keep a clean default.theme to easily swap back to
17:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nytek]
17:54 +znx: billnye: but im saying the default.theme is stored anyway?
17:54 +__monty__: billnye: It doesn't really matter to me I'm planning to start of of a clean slate anyway but thanks for warning.
17:55 +billnye: znx: only because he's on default.theme
17:55 +znx: O_o
17:56 +billnye: znx: would also apply to other systemwide themes, but wouldn't to user-installed
17:56 +znx: billnye: but the default.theme is copied to ~/.irssi/ when you first run irssi?
17:57 +znx: so local changes are in ~/ which the master is in /usr/share/irssi/
17:57 +Bazerka: default.theme is located in DATADIR and irssi copies it from there to its config dir as needed (on first run, or if default.theme is deleted/renamed there)
17:57 +znx: thats what im saying :P
17:57 +Bazerka: so you can trash the one in your config dir and you still have a good one to recover from
17:57 +billnye: all of which is entirely tangentialto the suggestion that you should back up your theme before messing with formats!
17:58 +__monty__: \me sneaks away while znx and billnye are having a friendly discussion, ooh yelling!
17:58 +billnye: default.theme and other system-provided theemes are an edge case to that advice
17:58 +Bazerka: if it's an unmodified default.theme that you are using, there is no need to back it up as there is already a "backup"
17:58 +billnye: __monty__: :)
17:58 +znx: your seek fails! ..
17:58 +billnye: Bazerka: if.
17:58 +znx: it hilighted me
17:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
18:00 +Bazerka: billnye: indeed, so, backing up your config's default.theme is only necessary if it's been modified. so if to you too!
18:00 +Bazerka: backing up an unmodified default.theme is pretty pointless :)
18:00 +Bazerka: redundant even
18:00 +billnye: Bazerka: once again, true but irrelevant to the advice that if you're making format or theme changes, you should probably make a backup
18:01 +billnye: in this case we advanced users know that the system has kindly already made the backup of default.theme for us
18:01 +billnye: so mission accomplished :)
18:01 +Bazerka: it's not irrelevant or tangental IF YOU HAVE AN UNMODIFIED DEFAULT.THEME, for the last time
18:01 +billnye: Bazerka: and I have never claimed otherwise
18:01 +Bazerka: you just did
18:01 +Bazerka: twice
18:02 +billnye: no, I said it was tangential to my advice
18:02 +Bazerka: but pointless argument is once again pointless
18:02 +billnye: which was given BEFORE the theme was known
18:02 +billnye: I'm not arguing that it's pointless to manually back up default.theme, I'm saying it's handy to HAVE a backup.
18:03 +Bazerka: only if you've modified it
18:03 +znx: im so glad i started this
18:03 +billnye: it will be modified on /save
18:03 * znx hides
18:03 +Bazerka: only if you've changed your formats
18:03 +Bazerka: is the point I'm clearly getting at
18:03 +billnye: Bazerka: which is exactly the context  of the advice I gave
18:04 +Bazerka: sigh
18:04 +billnye: again, I've not in the slightest disagreed with the case you two are addressing
18:05 +billnye: my advice was more general than the case, and the case you describe meets the advice I gave. the end.
18:05 +Bazerka: backing up an unmodified default.theme before you /save modified formats is needless, because there is already a pristine copy elsewhere
18:05 +billnye: correct.
18:05 +Bazerka: so it is only of value backing up if it has already been modified from the stock copy
18:05 +billnye: again, default.theme wasn't mentioned until after my advice
18:06 +billnye: you guys are making argument where there is none, on my part
18:06 +billnye: the fact that he's using default.theme takes "manually copy" out of my advice for HIS situation
18:07 +Bazerka: you're advising that it is always wise to backup default.theme and we're saying, no, it's not needed if it's a stock copy
18:07 +billnye: but doesn't change the "have a copy somewhere safe" sentiment
18:07 +billnye: I did not advise that
18:07 +Bazerka: that is what you're implying however
18:07 +billnye: I'm advising that it's always wise to have a backup copy of your theme
18:07 +billnye: before you make changes
18:08 +billnye: default.theme has a backup premade for you, and that's good for noobs to know in addition to my advice
18:08 +Bazerka: and we're saying that's not necessary if you're runnign a stock default before you made your current mods
18:08 +billnye: again, you're seeing an argument from me where I've intended none whatsoever
18:08 +billnye: I never claimed that was false
18:08 +billnye: we coo' here, guise
18:10 +billnye: a tangent SHARES a point with the curve it splits from :)
18:11 * billnye hands out free points to everyone
18:12 +Bazerka: a tangent can still end up perpendicular to that curve
