00:23 +hippytaff: a simple question, how do I read private messages with irssi?
00:23 +jjcm_: just navigate over to the window they show up in
00:24 +jjcm_: It'll appear just like a channel will
00:24 +jjcm_: so use ctrl+n or ctrl+p to cycle over to it
00:24 +jjcm_: or go directly using alt+#ofthewindow
00:24 +shabble: or ctrl-a to hop to active (hilighted) windows
00:24 +yitz_: Or alt+a
00:24 +shabble: oh yeah, alt

00:56 +Dirm: did that not work?

16:13 +r4__: something like /mode $nick +x
16:14 +vague`: /umode
16:14 +vague`: No need for nick.
16:14 +r4__: nice
16:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v supercosmonaut]
16:14 +vague`: r4__, See http://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars
16:15 +vague`: You have to eval the command to interpolate the vars though.

16:17 +Death4Life: I never saw that word before :o
16:17 +Death4Life: atleast not in english
16:18 +vague`: There's a similar word meaning you drift in some direction
16:18 +MinceR: veer is correct
16:19 +Death4Life: I already googled it :p
16:19 +vague`: Yeah, me too :P
16:20 +billnye: veer is usually more of a sudden motion than drift
16:20 +billnye: you'd usually drift toward the ditch and veer back toward the road
16:21 +vague`: Can you detect my fist as it veers towards your head? :P

16:39 +lolcat: Can I make irssi support shunning?
16:39 +Koffa: now I'm just wondering if it does a useless replace to _all_ incoming msgs since I couldn't use any target/mask -limitations o,O
16:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v joneal]
16:40 +MinceR: lolcat: if it's just an irc command you need to execute, /quote shun can probably do it
16:40 +MinceR: if you want to type less, you can alias it
16:40 +lolcat: MinceR: I want /ignore to become /shun
16:41 +MinceR: you can probably alias it, though if the syntax is different, that can make it more complicated
16:41 +lolcat: MinceR: And I want irssi to say: $nick is now shunned. and $nick is now unshunned
16:41 +MinceR: ic
16:41 +MinceR: that's a bit beyond my experience, but probably someone can give a quick answer
16:41 +MinceR: (putting multiple commands in an alias, that is)
16:42 +lolcat: Multiple commands?
16:42 +lolcat: I just have to alias /ignore to /shun
16:42 +MinceR: does /shun itself print those "is now shunned" messages?
16:43 +grawity: Isn't /shun, like, network-wide?
16:43 +MinceR: i figure an ircop could use shun in place of ignore ;)
16:44 +MinceR: bbl

17:05 +znx: i normally use "list available" then "list" then "search"
17:06 +znx: jasonmchristos: you should also check out the "whatprovides" command

17:21 +jasonmchristos: what would this command be for fedora znx : sudo ln -s ../cap_sasl.pl cap_sasl.pl
17:22 +grawity: It would be "ln -s ../cap_sasl.pl cap_sasl.pl"
17:22 +grawity: (Who the hell uses *sudo* for *that*?)
17:23 +deryni: People much too used to Ubuntu?
17:23 +jasonmchristos: whats the ln -s doing?
17:23 +Zmx: a symlinks
17:24 +grawity: I mean, I'm fine with sudo and I use it often... but dude, you don't *need* root to symlink.
17:24 +jasonmchristos: why do i need to symlink in the same dir?
17:25 +Zmx: jasonmchristos: not the same dir, the ".." dir
17:25 +jasonmchristos: wait where was i supposed to place the actual file?
17:25 +jasonmchristos: i put it in autorun
17:26 +jasonmchristos: which goes where?
17:26 +Zmx: idealy put the original in scripts, and the symlinks in autorun
17:26 +deryni: In general the pattern is the script goes in scripts/ with a symlink in autorun/.
17:26 +jasonmchristos: i see let me move it
17:26 +deryni: Which lets you turn scripts on and off without messing with the actual script files, just links.

17:34 +grawity: Recent Irssi versions should not need -ssl_cacert

18:16 +Zmx: And of course you have read the beginners guid and the FAQ ?
18:16 +T3LL0: how can I see the list of users
18:17 +Zmx: Read the beginners guide =)
18:17 +T3LL0: where it is?
18:17 +T3LL0: link?
18:17 +deryni: On the irssi site in the topic.
18:18 +T3LL0: oh! I see :D
18:21 +Koffa: hmm
18:22 +Koffa: can I somehow prevent useless wrapping of "words" longer than term width?
18:23 +Koffa: I can understand that a long word is "dropped" to the next line if it would be cut in two otherwise, but when there will be one LF anyway, it seems kinda pointless
18:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v paggas]
18:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Brownout]
18:25 +deryni: I don't think I understand the question/issue, but that's probably ok because I probably wouldn't have an answer either. =)
18:26 +Koffa: term width 80 chars, 100 char url. timestamp + nick takes 20 chars ->
18:26 +Koffa: 20 chars \n 80 chars \n 20 chars \n
18:26 +Koffa: if that was to be cut 20/80 instead of 80/20 it would fit in two lines
18:27 +Koffa: (or 60/40, but you get teh point)
18:28 +T3LL0: cannot find what I'm looking for
18:28 +T3LL0: how can I scroll back?
18:28 +T3LL0: to read previous messages
18:28 +deryni: Page up.

18:29 +deryni: That would be nifty I suppose.
18:30 +T3LL0: thanks deryni
18:32 +Koffa: hmm... maybe a private tinyurl could be teh solution here (:)

19:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v grawity]
19:43 +Babar: and the error is obvious, the fix is a bit harder... dunno if there are some mount options to automagically recode utf8 encoding (I thikn that's what ext3 uses) to the one ntfs uses. I think I used to mount with option utf8 the ntfs partition, but... been ages
19:44 +grawity: NTFS *always* uses Unicode (UTF-16 on disk)
19:44 +drazak: it doesn't always /display/ unicode though
19:45 +grawity: On Linux, display depends on your locale
19:45 +grawity: And ext3 too - names there are just bytes, the encoding depends on whatever the system uses.

20:20 +Nei: not easy to grok the current state of code
20:21 +r4_: is the list interactive at all?

20:22 +Nei: unfortunately not hehe
20:22 +r4_: meh
20:22 +r4_: might have to think about this a little more :P
20:22 +r4_: mebbe ill worry about it AFTER im done doing basic config stuff

20:25 +r4_: not at all
20:25 +r4_: im drifting away from that
20:25 +r4_: the nicklist is really just for bitlbee
20:25 +r4_: so its easier to keep track of who is online and who isnt
