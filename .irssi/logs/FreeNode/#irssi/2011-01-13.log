01:33 +hacim: well I did have:
01:33 +billnye: if you want all notices to behave the same, and you want all notices less attention-grabby, that's perfect
01:34 +hacim: 2 .*  NOTICES -regexp -color %M -actcolor %M
01:34 +billnye: hacim: hilighting them is worse in some ways
01:34 +mauke: o_O
01:34 +billnye: hacim: even with normal act
01:34 +hacim: i just removed that
01:34 +billnye: hacim: I tried that method with a bot in another channel :)
01:34 +billnye: before someone crafted up the "ignore from [Act: ] patch I was mentioning
01:35 +billnye: closequote after closebracket
01:35 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 98 seconds
01:35 +hacim: i was trying to get similarly clever with my nagios bot to make it display its notices in green when it got a RECOVERY and red when it was CRITICAL, etc.
01:36 +billnye: see, those are high priority and addressed to you... /hilight is probably a good solution there
01:37 +billnye: but /hilight to demote messages turns out a little bit like yelling EVERYBODY IGNORE THIS NOBODY LISTEN TO ME in some ways
01:45 +hacim: why are there three columnbs of formats for colors on http://irssi.org/documentation/formats ?
01:46 @Dirm: because there are three columns of effects, too
01:47 +mauke: wow, replaces is evil
01:47 +hacim: there are? i dont see any column headers for those
01:47 +hacim: text formats, hilights, etc.?
01:48 +mauke: what
01:48 @Dirm: which part are you looking at?
01:48 @Dirm: e.g. %k      %K      %0      black           dark grey       black ?
01:48 +hacim: yeah
01:48 @Dirm: if you look at the headers
01:48 @Dirm: %k -> black text, %K -> dark grey text, %0 -> black background
01:48 @Dirm: it's kind of a weird table
01:48 +hacim: yeah it is

02:07 +davo: hi all. trying to connect irssi at university library, but getting "Irssi: Looking up irc.freenode.net Irssi: Connecting to irc.freenode.net [130.239.18.172] port 6667 Irssi: Unable to connect server irc.freenode.net port 6667 [Connection            timed out]" is there another port i can get irssi to use and connect?
02:08 +billnye: davo: check  http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml to see
02:08 +davo: ok thanks, i'll give that a shot
02:10 +davo: when attempting to use another port, do i just start irssi from command line specifying the other port such as: "irssi -p 6666" ?
02:13 +nightfrog: The school probably has it blocked
02:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip]
02:16 +billnye: davo: /help connect /help server /help network
02:20 +davo: hm, no luck, thanks though
02:32 +shabble: davo: you could maybe tyr the ssl stuff running on differen ports?
02:35 +davo: shabble: do i specify the port inside when running irssi, or when starting irssi from command line?
02:36 +shabble: davo: both work. Doing it form within irssi (see the previous help topics mentioned by billnye) is probably easier
02:38 +davo: ok, so according to the help topic mentioned by billnye, would it be something like: /connect irc.freenode.net --port 6666 ?
02:39 +davo: because it's defaulting to 6667, which times out
02:39 +davo: or gets refused
02:41 +shabble: /connect irc.freenode.net 6666
02:46 --- davo is now known as davo_
02:47 +davo_: cool, that might be working, now i've got:  Irssi: Connection to irc.freenode.net established... !barjavel.freenode.net *** Looking up your hostname...
02:47 +davo_: where it seems to be hanging
02:50 +shabble: might take a little while for dns resolution to fail, get porrtscanned for proxies, etc.

05:38 +hacim: i have a nagios bot that spits into a channel notify messages. I wanted to hilight based on what it said
05:38 +hacim: so I set: /hilight nagbot NOTICES -regexp RECOVERY -color %G -actcolor %G
05:39 +hacim: so I set: /hilight nagbot NOTICES -regexp WARNING -color %Y -actcolor %Y
05:39 +hacim: and: /hilight nagbot NOTICES -regexp CRITICAL -color %R -actcolor %R
05:39 +hacim: but it doesn't seem to be working properly
05:42 +deryni: Unless I'm missing something those commands are badly malformed. What does /hilight say your current hilights are?
05:43 +hacim: hm yeah
05:43 +tmr: Reading /help hilight is first step, order of arguments matter.
05:43 +hacim: you are right, i just realized I can only use <text> once, so I can't use it for -regexp and -match
05:43 +deryni: Among other things wrong with those commands, yeah.
05:44 +deryni: -match?
05:44 +tmr: Prolly meant -mask.
05:45 +hacim: yeah, this works: WARNING #nagstatus -regexp -color %Y -actcolor %Y
05:45 +hacim: but I can't restrict it to a particular username
05:45 +k-man: shabble: that ido-switcher script seems interesting
05:46 +deryni: That attempt still looks wrong to me and I'm not sure why you'd need -regexp there.
05:47 +hacim: deryni: i'm using -regexp to search for the pattern WARNING, which is what the bot says when there is a a nagios warning condition
05:47 +tmr: WARNING is valid, simple but still, regex :)
05:47 +hacim: i have a -regexp CRITICAL that is red, and a -regexp RECOVERY which is green
05:48 +deryni: Right, why does that need regexp at all though? Why not just leave -regexp off?
05:49 +tmr: It would be too simple.
05:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
05:49 +hacim: yeah, I guess I dont need regexp

05:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v droidfrog]
05:57 +shabble: k-man: yeah, it's my take on the window_switcher, but with a bunch more features
05:57 +k-man: shabble: yeah looks cool, i'm just trying to install it now
05:57 +shabble: I'd like to add a few more things, like filter by network, etc.
05:57 +k-man: ive recently been using ido mode in emacs too
05:57 +k-man: so its timely
05:58 +shabble: shouldn't be too hard, just get uberprompt.pl from url in the comments, and you should b eset :)0
05:58 +shabble: it's not /quite/ like emacs ido, for one because modeal meta- bindings are a hassle.
05:59 +k-man: nice, works well! i like it
05:59 +k-man: ah, i don't even use the ido keys in emacs yet
06:01 +k-man: yeah, works beautifully! thanks shabble
06:02 +shabble: np, enjoy :)
06:02 +shabble: there'll probably be bugs, but I haven't found any show-stoppers recently
06:05 +shabble: I've been contemplating an ed-mode just to round things off, but I think that might be just a bit too mean :)
06:05 +k-man: ed mode?
06:05 +shabble: never used ed?
06:05 +shabble: it's the standard editor!
06:05 +k-man: oh.. ok,
06:06 +k-man: yeah, sorry, i was thinking in terms of emacs modes
06:06 +shabble: well, you could always attempt erc, or rcirc or whatever
06:06 +shabble: but I like irssi and perl too much for that :)
06:08 +k-man: shabble: i did erc in the past but it didn't do it for me
06:08 +k-man: i like irssi and perl too
06:08 +k-man: and i run it under gnu screen on my server, so i can connect from any of my machines
06:08 +k-man: works really well for me
06:09 +shabble: yep
06:09 +k-man: i did try and hack some plugin once in irssi, but i failed
06:09 +shabble: I faffed with irssi-proxy for a while to see if I could use both, but it never really worked out
06:09 +shabble: plugin for what?
06:09 +k-man: yeah, i tried it too, but it never worked
06:10 +k-man: i have noticed that if you /j #mac say... you get redirected to ##mac
06:10 +shabble: he
06:10 +k-man: but if you are already on ##mac, irssi dumps you back into  the channel you were in before
06:11 +k-man: then you type your mac related question into #irssi and look like an idiot
06:11 +shabble: probably some quirk of the redirect system.
06:11 +shabble: I think the solution is don't rely on /j for window switching :)
06:11 +k-man: i found a plugin which seemed to be for a different irc network that purported to solve the problem - tried to hack it for freenode, failed and gave up
06:12 +k-man: shabble: but thats not a solution really because you might forget you are already on ##mac
06:12 +shabble: hmm
06:12 +shabble: got a url for the original?
06:12 +k-man: ill have a look hang on
06:21 +k-man: can't seem to find it
06:23 +k-man: http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/dancer_forwardfix.pl
06:23 +k-man: thats it
06:23 +k-man: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/dancer_forwardfix.pl.html
06:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cloq]
06:35 +shabble: from a quick look at it, I get the feeling that's for a different problem
06:36 +k-man: yeah, i was hacking it to work for my problem i think...
06:37 +shabble: what is your actual problem? typing '/j #foo' should take you to ##foo if you're already joined to it?
06:37 +shabble: freenode seems to complain about invite-only if you try to join a redirected channel once you've already been forwareded
06:38 +k-man: err.. /j #foo should joing ##foo if freenode redirects you to ##foo and you are already on ##foo
06:39 +shabble: well, that's the thing, it doesn't redirect you a second time. It just gives an invite-only notice.
06:41 +droidfrog: s///
06:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
06:41 +k-man: oh, thats weird
06:44 +k-man: oh well
06:50 +shabble: it's sending a 470 numeric the first time (redirecting you to ...)
06:50 +shabble: but I'm not sure about the actual mechanics of the forward
06:51 +k-man: yeah, i noticed the 470, i think the code changed at some point from 379 or whatever is in the script
06:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v loadedwithwyrms]
06:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v phizz]
06:56 +shabble: looks like it's done with +i and then +f ##foo
06:58 +shabble: you ought to be able to write a script that catches event 470, logs the a -> b linkage, and subsequent 473 invite-only messages just switch you to window(item) of b instead.
06:58 +shabble: stick it in my gH issue tracker thing and I'll write it when I have a bit of time.
06:59 +k-man: heh
06:59 +k-man: ok
06:59 +Dice-Man: meooooow
07:00 +Dice-Man: does irssi irssing well people ?
07:12 +k-man: shabble: i hope my description of the problem is not too crypting in the ticket
07:12 +k-man: gtg, bye all

14:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vincent_wang]
14:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Atlantic777]
14:59 +Atlantic777: Hi! Can I run irssi in that way that it opens it's own console window (in x)?
15:00 +tmr: MariachiAC, check beep* scripts in http://scripts.irssi.org.
15:01 +tmr: Atlantic777, tell you terminal to run irssi when you launch it.
15:02 +Atlantic777: tmr: so... add an alias to bashrc irssi = xterm -e irssi
15:02 +Atlantic777: ?
15:02 +MariachiAC: tmr: Ok. I'll take a look at them.
15:02 +tmr: Atlantic777, that's one way.
15:03 +Atlantic777: tmr: any other ways?
15:03 +Atlantic777: I want't to make keyboard hotkey for running irssi.
15:03 +tmr: That's other way.
15:04 +Atlantic777: blaah, but in dwm it doesn't work
15:04 +Atlantic777: dwm: execvp xterm -e irssi failed. No such file or directory.
15:04 +Atlantic777: :/
15:04 +Atlantic777: but just xterm works

15:14 +yitz_: /hilight MariachiAC
15:14 +yitz_: What sort of notification? There's notify scripts on scripts.irssi.org
15:16 +MariachiAC: yitz_: Ok now is there a way for them to automatically appear when your in another channel?
15:17 +yitz_: Appear in that other channel?
15:17 +webvictim: the number in the activity bar will change colour by default
15:18 +webvictim: you can use a split window to put all highlights in a different part of the screen if you like
15:19 +MariachiAC: webvictim: that might work, but I'd just like to get a notification when I'm chatting on another channel. I use a screen reader meaning I use text to speech to read the screen.
15:19 +webvictim: you'd probably be better off looking at the scripts on scripts.irssi.org then
