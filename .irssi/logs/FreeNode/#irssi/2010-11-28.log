02:29 +em: how can you use OTR on irssi?
02:34 +Bazerka: via the irssi-otr plugin, I guess
02:34 +em: how do you start a plugin in irssi though? it's different than a script?
02:34 +billnye: /help load
02:39 +em: hm.
02:39 +em: so what is the difference between a script and a plugin?
02:40 +billnye: a script is a perl script, a plugin is a compiled object plugin.
02:40 +em: do you know where you get the otr plugin?
02:40 +billnye: on teh googlez
02:41 +shabble: inter....net?
02:41 +em: wait i bet i can get it with aptitude.

19:33 +unicum: it was sent in ##linux.. but irssi now shows me hilights in whichever window i am
