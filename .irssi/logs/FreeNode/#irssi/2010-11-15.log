00:35 +Dirm: lantana: you described what dispatch.pl does; billnye posted a modified version that allows /## to go to a window
00:38 +billnye: lantana: the fact that dispatch.pl is for unknown commands and your problem involved an unknown command was a bit of a red herring

04:23 +redscare: yitz_: "/ignore &bitlbee MODES" works, but i want to see other messages, just want to ignore the localhost.localdomain sets +/- v ones
04:24 +yitz_: I'm not sure if you can filter modes by who sets them. Maybe -mask ?
04:24 +redscare: yitz_: so in this case regexp and pattern don't apply to the message that I see?

09:26 +ds187_: you could use bitlbee and the buildin twitter support, because bitlbee is handeld just like a "normal" irc server and therefor is also useable through irssi-proxy

11:40 +jink: Great.  You found a broken script. :)
11:41 +onla: http://pastebin.ca/1992039
11:42 +onla: the quizmaster.pl works ok with the default question set. I try to use my own, that uses these ' symbols.. is that apopstrophe or something.. which I think messes it up
11:42 +onla: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/quizmaster.pl.html
11:47 +onla: oops
11:47 +onla: that is not the beginning of the file actually
11:47 +onla: so those errors don't correspong, but it is not the point
11:49 +onla: http://pastebin.ca/1992046
11:50 +onla: how can I include ' in there ? can I modify the quizmaster.pl so that it doesn't think the ' is nothing more than text string for evaluating and not something about the code. I'm not too familiar with this coding language
11:54 +Ticho: \' might work
11:54 +onla: i'll try
11:59 +onla: doesn't seem to work. I fix it on the 2nd line, but still the same error. Might be a runaway multi-line '' string starting on line 2)
11:59 +onla: but for me that error msg is about that ' on the line 2 which it would think is starting this multi-line string with ''
12:13 +shabble: onla: is that error during load, or when it tries to load the question file?
12:14 +onla: when i do /script load
12:17 +shabble: crikey, it sems to load the questions file with eval "$text" :(
12:18 +shabble: I think you need to clear the /set quizmaster_questions_file setting
12:19 +shabble: then do /quizmaster import <filename>
12:19 +shabble: since your questions look to be in the 'moxxfile format' as fara s I can tell from the code
12:21 +shabble: also, that code is all kinds of horrible. I'd rewrite it if I could be bothered
12:22 +onla: yeah i iported the default q-file, then I just replaced the file.
12:23 +shabble: successfully?
12:24 +onla: no that was before sorry. I do this thing soon
12:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]
12:24 +shabble: ok. Change that setting, then reload he script, then try the import
12:25 +onla: that setting is not there since I have not loaded the script
12:25 +shabble: ah, true
12:26 +shabble: maybe just rename ~/.irssi/quizmaser_questions
12:26 +shabble: so it doesn' thave a file to load
12:30 +onla: I wonder where the moxxfile format file I used to import the original is
12:30 +onla: and how the syntax looked in that anyway... do I need to create a file with that moxx syntax to import, rather than replace the imported file
12:31 +onla: i'll eat now. food is getting cold. I'll see if I can find a file to import..
12:32 +onla: or is this category: questions: answers: the moxxfile format, I don't remember o.O
12:32 +onla: it's a while I did that
12:41 +shabble: onla: https://gist.github.com/700276

17:55 +jink: rolle_: Do you reconnect, or disconnect/connect?
17:55 +rolle_: jink, Tried both.
17:55 +jink: When did you update the ip?
17:55 +tmr: aborticide, exact command was?
17:56 +rolle_: jink, Couple of hours ago.
17:56 +rolle_: jink, It's updated in web server, but not in irc server.
17:56 +jink: Depending on your TTL, it might not yet work.
17:56 +rolle_: Or should I restart the irc server?
17:56 +rolle_: Maybe I'll connect to the IP while waiting
17:56 +jink: I don't think that should matter, unless you didn't bind to the new ip yet.
17:56 +jink: I guess you could do that.
17:56 +rolle_: Yeh.
17:57 +jink: dig a my.host.name
17:57 +jink: Oh. :(
17:58 +aborticide: tmr: exactly as i gave it to you
18:00 +tmr: aborticide, try it in this channel.
18:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dhruvasagar]

18:02 +lilibox_: exit
18:02 +lilibox_: not here but screen window :-)
18:02 +lilibox_: i tried elimination proccess
18:02 +tmr: "/lastlog /home/ubuntu/cats.txt" searches your lastlog for string /home/ubuntu/cats.txt, "/lastlog -file foobar" will dump lastlog to file foobar.
18:02 +lilibox_: looks like problem is in irssi

18:03 +zok: I think I asked this once before... is there a way to get irssi to sort the /list by # of users in the channel?
18:03 +lilibox_: special chars seems ok
18:03 +lilibox_: i started screen
18:03 +lilibox_: and did the same
18:03 +lilibox_: chars fine again

18:22 +tmr: Works for me.
18:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v paggas_]
18:23 +lilibox_: or just utf8?
18:23 +lilibox_: i am not sure if i do right thing when i am trying to start screen with -U flag

18:24 +Barlow: i have utf-8
18:24 +Barlow: and it works ;)

18:32 +lilibox_: haha
18:33 +lilibox_: looks like it works
18:33 +grenouille: I try to find out which setting the userpart in front of a cloak commes from -- without success
18:33 +lilibox_: but mirc had problems with typing of those special chars with its default fonts :-0
18:34 +lilibox_: thank you guys for your cooperation service, support and helps
18:34 +tmr: grenouille, wulf?
18:34 +grenouille: not env USER, IRCNAME REALNAME nor /set real_name or /set user_name
18:34 +lilibox_: yes, twirssi works like a charm too
18:34 +grenouille: yes
18:35 +grenouille: wulf@ should be grenouille@
18:35 +tmr: grenouille, you can't change that in irssi, becouse server got that from your identd.
18:36 +grenouille: tmr: ahh, thanks, I'll look inside identd
18:37 +tmr: grenouille, user_name is right setting _if_ you don't have identd running.

19:33 +xand: why do I get the "pasting X lines to #channel, press ctrl-k to paste" message on something that irssi (I presume) is going to join together into 1 line?
19:36 +bburhans: I think paste_join_multiline takes effect after the paste_detect_time setting
19:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
19:36 +bburhans: not sure, though
19:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rob_]
19:37 +rob_: hi
19:37 +rob_: is it possible for me to make irssi write out the window status to a file? i want to poll the file from an external app on a remote machine via ssh..
19:38 +nightfrog: Yes
19:38 +nightfrog: status?
19:38 +tmr: Activity?
19:38 +nightfrog: /lastlog -file file.log
19:39 +rob_: can i make it change every time its updated in irssi?
19:39 +nightfrog: Use w/e file and extension name you want
19:39 +nightfrog: rob_: Still not extactly sure what you want
19:39 +Dirm: rob_: maybe you just want to enable logging?
19:40 +tmr: I would prefer rob_ explaining what he wants than start guessing.
19:41 +rob_: the bit of the status bar that tells me which windows are active, i.e: win: 1,2,5. I'd like this to be written to a file so i can check it from another application. I'd like the file to be updated every time the status bar updates the same information in my actual irssi session
19:41 +rob_: make sense? :)
19:41 +tmr: rob_, activity_file.pl
19:41 +nightfrog: Sounds like you need a script
19:41 +nightfrog: hehe like that
19:42 +rob_: just found this: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/act_fifo.pl.html
19:42 +rob_: thanks :)
19:43 +nightfrog: Might want to try both as one may not save the info you want

20:59 +m0ar: When someone writes my nick, I want the whole line to be in yellow. At what line do I set this, and how?
20:59 +Pieter: < just made irssi and screen crash :s
20:59 +m0ar: Pieter: Do tell how you managed
20:59 +Pieter: I don't know :P
21:00 +Pieter: my screen went all green and pink
21:00 +Pieter: i apperently send irssi to the background or so
21:00 +Pieter: then did fg
21:00 +Pieter: and boom crash
21:00 +Pieter: could not find master process to attach or something similar
21:04 +m0ar: Well, gj :)
21:05 * Argafal pressed Ctrl+Z, typed bg, typed fg, irssi works just fine ;)
21:05 +Pieter: yeah, here mostly too

21:13 +shabble: m0ar: /set hilight_nick_matches off
21:13 +shabble: then /hilight -line <yournick>
21:14 +m0ar: shabble: Wonders, then how do I specify a colour for that line?
21:15 +shabble: m0ar: /help hilight
21:15 +m0ar:  -color %G/%R/%Y?
21:15 +shabble: -color I think
21:15 +m0ar: yah
21:15 +m0ar: shabble: Could you m0ar me?
21:16 +shabble: m0ar: m0ar!
21:16 +m0ar: That's wonderful. However, if I'd want YOUR nick to be in orange and your message in red?
21:16 +m0ar: That has to be done in the config right?
21:17 +m0ar: Theme*
21:19 +shabble: you could try the nickcolor script
21:20 +shabble: do you mean for all hilights, nick should be in x, line in y?
21:22 +m0ar: Indeed
21:22 +m0ar: At least for my nick
21:22 +m0ar: aka someone talks to me, then the usual hilight function for w/e else
21:23 +shabble: I'm not sure I fully understand
21:26 +mingdao: is there some way to output /topic to the status window and not in that channel? on the fly, without writing/installing a script?
21:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vert2]
21:32 +Bazerka:  /w 14
21:34 +shabble: /alias statustopic /eval /echo -window (status) Topic of $C: $topic
21:35 +m0ar:  Easy as a pie
21:41 +mingdao: is that apple pie or chocolate pie?  ;)
21:55 +m0ar:  Apple
21:56 +m0ar: Anyone of you happen to use nicklist?
21:57 +ds187: yes
21:58 +m0ar: ds187: Could you paste me your nicklist_fifo_path
21:58 +m0ar: I changed that variable, cant remember the original value and now nicklistfifo wont work
21:58 +Koffa: reset?
21:58 +m0ar: Koffa: How2?
21:58 +Koffa: /set -default ...
21:58 +Koffa: dunno if it works for scripts
21:59 +Koffa: rtfs if not :)
21:59 +ds187: it is /home/ds187/.irssi/nicklistfifo
21:59 +m0ar: Yeah, .irssi is the same for me
