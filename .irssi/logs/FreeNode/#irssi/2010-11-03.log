11:13 +Flyoc: how do I kill the buffers again in irssi please ?
11:15 +slackie: huh?
11:15  gryllida: /clear for all channels I guess
11:16 +slackie: ahm
11:16 +slackie: KISS
11:16  gryllida: ?
11:16 +slackie: nvm :-)
11:17 +slackie: and there are a /clear -all to clean all windows, /clear just clear the current window.
11:17 +Flyoc: non
11:17 +Flyoc: no*
11:17 +Flyoc: the network buffers
11:17 +slackie: wtf are network buffers? :-F
11:17 +Death4Life:  /server purge ?
11:17 +Flyoc: ha yeah
11:17 +Flyoc: thanks Death4Life !
11:18 +Death4Life: 11:17:40 /SERVER PURGE [<target>]
11:18 +Death4Life: 11:17:40
11:18 +Death4Life: 11:17:40 Clears the server send queue. Useful if, for example, you accidentally paste lots of text to a channel.
11:18 +Flyoc: sorry for mislabeling those send queues.

15:47 +Death4Life: ( for simcop2387 his problem )
15:49 +simcop2387: Death4Life: i want to see the messages just not have them hilight
15:50 +simcop2387: and the trigger idea didn't work but i've been too distracted to mention it
15:51 +ealexp: simcop2387: it's impossible to do that with irssi
15:52 +simcop2387: ealexp: that's what i wondered
15:52 +simcop2387: i may try to code in something for it directly since its a feature i sorely miss from xchat
15:54 +ealexp: I've already tried to do it, and the only way at this time is to intercept the message before it is displayed
15:55 +ealexp: and to put an invisible character in the middle of your nick
15:55 +simcop2387: that's what the example from the trigger plugin does but it doesn't appear to work
15:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v explore]
15:55 +ealexp: it should work
15:56 +simcop2387: or at least i can't get it to match on that nick/host for some reason
15:57 +simcop2387: full HM is *buffextras!buffextras@znc.in, i haven't examined the code to see why it might not be matching the mask *!*@znc.in
15:58 +ealexp: maybe because of the "*" in front of the "buffextras"
15:58 +ealexp: maybe because of the "*" in front of "buffextras"*
15:58 +simcop2387: that's what i suspect and what i plan on investigating in the source later tonight
15:59 +simcop2387: it wouldn't match *buffextras!*@* either
15:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v slackie]
16:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fender0107401]
16:02 +ealexp: someone should fill a feature request to create a "event hilight" or an -exclude flag for the /hilight command
16:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v marienz]
16:02 +ealexp: but I doubt this will ever be implemented
16:03 +simcop2387: that's what i may end up doing if i decide that making sense of the trigger.pl source is more invasive than the irssi source
16:03 +simcop2387: most likely the -exclude flag
16:04 +ealexp: simcop2387: actually someone already did it : http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=754
16:06 +simcop2387: haha
16:08 +ealexp: but no one cares
16:08 +ealexp: and fixing this bug would probably require many code to be rewritten
16:09 +simcop2387: i may just give it a shot and see what i can do since it drives me nuts to have to go through every channel when i reconnect on my laptop
16:10 +Dirm: you can cheat with trigger.pl to exclude messages from hilight
16:12 +simcop2387: Dirm: as i've mentioned above i've tried but there's something funny going on with the matching in masks that i've got to investigate
16:13 +Dirm: oh, sorry, didn't scroll up enough
16:13 +shabble: simcop2387: something has the nick '*buffextras'?
16:13 +simcop2387: shabble: yes from the bouncer
16:14 +Dirm: what trigger command did you try?
16:14 +shabble: oh, ok. Didn't think that was usually allowed in nicks :)
16:14 +simcop2387: shabble: i don't think it is on most servers, but the bouncer does it so that it's obvious that it isn't a bot or service on the server :)
16:14 +shabble: yeah, makes sense
16:14 +simcop2387: -all -nocase -masks '*!*@znc.in' -regexp '(sim)(cop)' -replace '$1\x02\x02$2'
16:14 +simcop2387: and also tried
16:15 +simcop2387: -all -nocase -masks '*buffextras!*@*' -regexp '(sim)(cop)' -replace '$1\x02 \x02$2'
16:15 +ealexp: hey
16:15 +ealexp: I know this is not really about irssi, but
16:15 +ealexp: has someone here already managed to get dcc chats working with znc ?
16:16 +simcop2387: no idea i haven't tried recently
16:16 +simcop2387: i didn't expect the second trigger to work, but figured i'd try it when the first didn't either
16:17 +shabble: simcop2387: hmm, conceivably the -regexp is anchored, so you might want '(sim)(cop\w+)'
16:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mroconnor]
16:19 +simcop2387: looking at the source, it isn't anchored at all, i wouldn't have expected it to be since the examples don't show the triggers wanting to eat up the entire string to be able to match
16:20 +shabble: yeah, it was a wild guess. I can't see anything wrong with it
16:20 +shabble: (your example line)
16:20 +simcop2387: yea i tore it right from the docs, my suspicion is that the mask isn't matching because of the * in the nick
16:21 +jink: lolwut?  A * in a nick? :S
16:22 +shabble: yeah
16:22 +shabble: looks like it's delegating to $server->masks_match, which probably isn't geared to handle *
16:22 +shabble: well, only as a wildcard, and gets confused.
16:22 +mquin: ZNC uses *status and so on for it's services (presumably to avoid clashing with real IRC nicks)
16:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fadein]
16:24 +ealexp: masks_match works well with nicks containing a wilcard
16:24 +ealexp: /script exec print Irssi::server_find_tag('Freenode')->masks_match('*123!*@*', '*123', 'a@a')
16:24 +ealexp: ---> 1
16:26 +shabble: ealexp: it also matches 'bacon123', but that should make it too broad, rather than too restrictive.
16:27 +mquin: simcop2387: '-privmsgs -masks *status*!znc@znc.in' seems to work
16:27 +simcop2387: as does mine from the trigger setup, hrm

16:37 +zouhair: Hi, is there a way to set an alternate nick in the config file?
16:37 +tmr: There's addallchannels alias which will save channels after you've setup your servers and networks.
16:37 +gryllida: yes, /set alternate_nick
16:37 +tmr: zouhair, -topic
16:37 +gryllida: do not edit config file by hand
16:37 +gryllida: whoops it's in the topic even, hehe

16:39 +zouhair: OK then, how to set an alternate nick for a certain server?
16:39 +tmr: /help network
16:39 +simcop2387: i've only ever editted it by hand to prevent it from connecting somewhere i didn't want it to the next time it starts up or something similar to that
16:39 +tmr: simcop2387, irssi -!
16:40 +simcop2387: ah neat
16:54 +zouhair: The only thing you can set with the network command is one nick, username and real name but no alternative nicks as in xchat
16:58 --- ryzer is now known as ryzer-afk
17:00 +billnye: zouhair: probably best not to set an alternate if tails_ are preferable to you than a global alt nick

17:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kani]
17:07 +Bazerka: alternate nick handling is somewhat broken anyways atm

17:08 +zouhair: I'll group tail_ and tail__ in some servers then
17:10 +billnye: zouhair: plus keepnick.pl is a least halfway decent :)
17:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v marienz]
17:10 +billnye: Bazerka: it sometimes skips right over the alt nick and goes to tails, right?
17:10 +billnye: at least that's the behavior I think I remember encountering
17:11 +Bazerka: tails/random digits, yes

17:40 +SmartViking: Hello folks. I use irssi and resently i have been writing a lot in the wrong channels since it is hard to see what channel i am currently inside - do you have any simple-to-do ideas that will prevent me to do so, i mean so that i know what chatroom i am in?
17:41 +Zmx: read the status
17:41 +Zmx: bar
17:42 +imMute: I have it in the "propmt" bar
17:43 +imMute: pretty sure its there by default
17:43 +bremner: I have the channel name twice
17:43 +bremner: once in sb, once in prompt
17:43 +SmartViking: Zmx: I know it's there but it's so not-obvious - if the theme had changed colors(random ones) for each room per examample, and the colors stayed as they where for each room - for the current session, it would be much easier
17:43 +imMute: ditto (as well as AWL)
17:43 +SmartViking: but that wont be so easy to do, of course
17:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v JoeMaverickSett]
17:45 +SmartViking: it is hard to parse the irssi interface and understand where you are, when you have like 6 tabs open
17:47 +bremner: 6?? tha tis not many.  Look at chanact maybe http://madduck.net/docs/chanact/
17:48 +Death4Life: wait untill you have 6 channels in 1 tab :P
17:48 +Zmx: It's not so hard. We go "where you want", we have the chan name twice
17:48 +bremner: Maybe you can just bold the channel name in the input bar
17:49 +SmartViking: bremner: maybe
17:49 +bremner: or maybe switch to xchat :)
