00:31 +dob1: hi, sorry i don't find in the help how to search in a channel
00:33 +Dirm: /lastlog
00:45 +Rhonda: ahf: http://bugs.debian.org/606319 - has a patch for #669 in the irssi BTS, do you want to take a look?
00:45 +dob1: thanks
00:51 +ahf: Rhonda: will give it a spin later, thanks
00:51 * ahf has been forced to write a wishlist tonight and can't find anything
00:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axims]
01:02 +sjk: ahf, for Christmas?
01:05 +ahf: sjk: yes
01:05 +shabble: ask for a pony
01:05 +shabble: that always works
01:05 +ahf: i'd prefer a goat.
01:06 * Myrtti asks for subscription extensions for audible and spotify
01:08 * ahf already has a spotify subscription
01:08 +ahf: that i love more than anything else ;(
01:08 +Myrtti: ahf: then ask for extension to it
01:10 +Myrtti: http://www.spotify.com/get-spotify/e-card/ <--
01:10 +ahf: suom1 is my pusher!
01:10 +ahf: but i still owe him money for it
01:10 +tm512: ever since I switched to freebsd, i cant get unicode characters to show in irssi
01:11 +Rhonda: ahf: And a patch for an irssi bug isn't on your wishlist?!
01:11 +ahf: nah ;(
01:11 +Rhonda: pah
01:11 +tm512: if I set term_charset to utf-8 and I get something like !?WU?@??@??WU!
01:11 +tm512: im also using screen -u
01:11 +suom1: mmmm ahf :)
01:12 +znx: tm512: fonts .. locale .. ?
01:12 +tm512: not sure
01:13 +Bazerka: heh, a patch to an unaccepted patch
01:14 +ahf: tm512: make sure your locale uses UTF-8
01:14 +ahf: check in irssi with /exec locale
01:14 +ahf: if it says POSIX or C then you're screwed
01:15 +tm512: my locale is set to "C" i guess
01:15 +znx: heh
01:15 +znx: thats your issue tm512 :)
01:16 +tm512: I see
01:16 +tm512: so i guess ubuntu had a different default
01:16 +tm512: worked fine when I used ubuntu on my server
01:17 +ahf: Ubuntu has sane defaults, yeah.
01:17 +ahf: change it to something like en_US.UTF-8 or en_GB.UTF-8 or whatever
01:18 +tm512: how
01:18 +tm512: bashrc?
01:18 +znx: ahf: only if that locale exists
01:18 +znx: ;-)
01:18 +ahf: if you're using bash, then do export LC_ALL="..." LANG="..."
01:18 +ahf: znx: sure.
01:18 +ahf: where ... is a locale that exists and has UTF-8
01:18 +ahf: usually en_GB.UTF-8 works for me, and i'm fairly sure that's what i use on freebsd too.
01:18 +znx: you can type:  locales
01:18 +znx: i think .. might be a linux only command
01:19 +ahf: locale -a
01:19 +znx: thats neat
01:19 +ahf: penis
01:19 +ahf: i mean, yeah.
01:19 +ahf: what's up for geek stuff for christmas?
01:19 +znx: ahf: your penis is neat too
01:19 +ahf: i suck at this
01:20 +tm512: im gonna try buying a new server with xmas money lol
01:20 +tm512: found one for $200
01:20 +ahf: https://secure.0x90.dk/~ahf/wishlist.html <- is what i have now and some of it purely stuff that costs like a million so it's not very intersting.
01:20 +znx: ahf: aim HIGH .. :)
01:21 +ahf: hah
01:21 +ahf: Canon EOS 5D mark II.
01:21 +ahf: that's like, 3000 euro or so
01:22 +sjk: I'd want some advice for Christmas
01:22 +ahf: ditto, that's what i'm asking for!
01:23 +ahf: i'm looking for cool stuff that's not freakin' expensive.
01:23 +sjk: Advice on what eSATA disk enclosure I should get for my backup server (Soekris net5501-70)
01:23 +ahf: the soekris doesn't do eSATA!
01:24 +sjk: It does too.
01:24 +ahf: requires a PCI card then!
01:24 +sjk: Nope
01:24 +ahf: err? what then?
01:24 +ahf: my net5501-70 doesn't have esata.
01:24 +sjk: It requires a cable. :)
01:24 +ahf: pffff, right :P
01:24 +sjk: (Yes, really.)
01:24 +ahf: i use PATA for the disk i have in mine
01:25 +sjk: You don't have to if you don't want to. :)
01:25 +ahf: oh, yeah, it wasn't "pfff, right" in that way
01:25 +ahf: it was, "true" :P
01:25 +sjk: Hehe
01:25 +sjk: I use a 1TB USB disk with mine
01:25 +ahf: i don't use either of my soekris boxes for anything yet ;(
01:25 +sjk: (The operating system is on a CF card)
01:25 +ahf: i have a net4501 and a net5501
01:25 +ahf: i have a gps timing chip that i should probably attach to the net4501
01:25 +sjk: I use mine for making nightly backups of a couple of servers and my laptop
01:25 +sjk: and my girlfriends laptop
01:26 +ahf: to do a l33t ntp stratum 1 setup
01:26 +ahf: oh, such that you can grab all her horse porn
01:26 +ahf: ?
01:26 +sjk: If she had any I could grab it, yes.
01:26 +ahf: (silence ...)
01:26 +ahf: ;D
01:26 +ahf: who's going to fosdem btw?
01:26 +ahf: i signed irssi up for a booth together with the exherbo guys
01:27 +ahf: hopefully we'll get one!
01:27 +tm512: ugh I assume i'll need to restart bash for this :<
01:27 +sjk: I gotta go get a shower and get some sleep
01:27 +sjk: See you later, ahf. :)
01:27 +ahf: you can just run the commands tm512
01:27 +ahf: goatnight sjk
01:28 +ahf: or source your .bashrc
01:28 +tm512: so in irssi, /exec export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
01:28 +tm512: and then s/LC_ALL/LANG
01:28 +tm512: ?
01:29 +ahf: no
01:30 +ahf: you have to restart irssi, yes
01:30 +ahf: you don't have to restart bash.
01:30 +tm512: damn
01:30 +tm512: hmm might be a good time to update to the latest snapshot then :P
01:30 +ahf: usually with irssi you can do naughty things like /script exec $ENV{'goat'}="blah", but you can't in this case.
01:31 +tm512: well, last time I tried to do svn it wouldnt compile, but the snapshot did
01:31 +ahf: what was the errors?
01:31 +Simon-: change ENV and then /upgrade
01:31 +ahf: trunk should compile
01:31 +tm512: i forget
01:31 +ahf: unless someone broke it
01:32 +tm512: im not even sure if I got a makefile, but this was a while back
01:32 +ahf: you probably forgot to run autogen
01:34 +tm512: possible
01:34 +tm512: anyway
01:39 +tm512: lol svn
01:39 +tm512: mercurial is better :>
01:40 +Bazerka: for our needs? not so much
01:40 +Bazerka: also, trunk builds fine
01:40 +Bazerka: Irssi 0.8.15-svn (20101209)
01:44  skizzhg: how can i have a list of _all_ windows like '/foreach /eval echo $C' does?
01:44 +shabble: just like that?
01:44  skizzhg: :)
01:45  skizzhg: i would see 'query' and 'window new' too, other random empty windows, everything
01:47 +ahf: mercurial is gay
01:47  skizzhg: sometimes i forget a window open and it stay there for weeks, until a new one is numbered 33 :)
01:47 +ahf: git pwns everything
01:47 +Bazerka: poor deluded ahf
01:47 +Bazerka: ;)

01:50  skizzhg: and i'm totally dumb, i forgot /window list :)
01:50 +tm512: git = no thanks
01:51 +tm512: hg apparently has much better windows support, but that doesnt personally affect me :P
01:51 +ahf: yes, that's the only good thing about hg
01:51 +Jack-is: Hi all, could someone look at http://uiu.me/dk.png ? Theme is at http://jack.users.anapnea.net/files/parenthetical.theme. I don't understand why those dark grey bits are dark grey. What variable would control them in the theme file?
01:51 +ahf: i used hg when i did windows development
01:52 +ahf: but then i quit my old job and now all i use is git
01:53 +Bazerka: so you're well on your way to becoming an old git \o/
01:53 +Bazerka: :P

18:53 +FauxFaux: Non-theoritical but olde situtaion; say a flooder joins and you want to voice all the people who were in the channel before the flooder joined (so you can +m); is there a convenient way to do that?  /lastlog -file | head -n 9000 | cut -d'<> -f 2 | sort | uniq | wrap-to-six-columns | sed 's,^,/mode #channel +vvvvvv ,' etc.
18:55 +tmr: If flooder is single person some sort of /massvoicewith exceptions would
18:55 +tmr: sound more sane.
18:55 +tmr: /mass-voice-with-exceptions script..
18:56 +FauxFaux: Random nicks, random hosts, etc.
18:57 +tmr: So not flooder or few flooder, but mass flood with botnet.
18:57 +jink: FauxFaux: sort -u | xargs -n 6 echo "/mode #channel +vvvvvv "
18:57 +FauxFaux: Nice application.
18:57 +FauxFaux: Uh, implementation.
18:58 +mauke: /voice is your friend
18:58 +jink: That doesn't answer your question, though. :P
18:58 +catsup: you can /voice any number of nicks tho
18:58 +jink: And -n is max-args, so the last +vvvvvv might be incomplete.
18:58 +catsup: irssi will do the splitting
18:58 +jink: catsup: Good call. :)
18:58 +FauxFaux: Yeah, I've used -n1 before, just didn't think about it.  catsup: I seem to think that that doesn't work and I don't know why.
18:59 +catsup: FauxFaux: it has to be configured to know the maximum number of +v on the particular irc network
18:59 +jink: ... | sort -u | xargs -n 10 echo "/voice" should work, right? :)
18:59 +FauxFaux: Seems like the kind of thing that should be sent at startup.
19:00 +catsup: 'max_modes'
19:00 +catsup: well the irc protocol is pretty stupid
19:00 +FauxFaux: Well, yes.
19:00 +jink: catsup: The server should give you that information, right?  Or do you have to explicitly configure it yourself?
19:01 +tmr: Server sends it on connect.

19:01 +tmr: to00:19 ircn> RFC2812 PREFIX=(ov)@+ CHANTYPES=#&!+ MODES=3 CHANLIMIT=#&!+:21 NICKLEN=15 TOPICLEN=255 KICKLEN=255 MAXLIST=beIR:64 CHANNELLEN=50 IDCHAN=!:5 CHANMODES=beIR,k,l,imnpstaqr are supported by this server
19:01 +catsup: irssi comes preconfigured with a bunch of different networks and their settings in default 'config'
19:01 +tmr: I've always thought that MODES is exactly that.
19:01 +catsup: oh
19:01 +catsup: yeah
19:01 +catsup: there you go
19:02 +jink: /lastlog " are supported by this server"
19:02 +FauxFaux: 19 on the network in question, mm.  /me tests.
19:03 +jink: bitlbee doesn't send MODES, just MAXTARGETS
19:03 +catsup: that mechanism is not in the irc standard tho
19:03 +FauxFaux: The startup flags stuff is totally in the "standard".
19:03 +catsup: does irssi in fact parse it?
19:03 +jink: I doubt it, but didn't try. :)
19:03 +catsup: i don't see it
19:04 +jink: Anyway, my weekend has begun.  Ttyl. ;)
19:04 +FauxFaux: catsup: /version sends it on most things.
19:04 +catsup: FauxFaux: where?
19:04 +FauxFaux: Server window.
19:04 +catsup: no i mean where is it in the standard
19:04 +catsup: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2812.html
19:04 +FauxFaux: Pfft, I'm too old for IRC RFCs.
19:05 +catsup: 13:03 <FauxFaux> The startup flags stuff is totally in the "standard".
19:05 +catsup: what did you mean then
19:05 +FauxFaux: The stuff comes through as message 005, which is "bounce" in your standard. :P
19:06 +catsup: umm
19:07 +FauxFaux: I'm guessing http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html
19:07 +catsup: http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03.txt
19:07 +catsup: nice
19:08 +FauxFaux: No idea whether it was ever officially taken anywhere, but it is there.
