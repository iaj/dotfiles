00:38 +tomik: hi
00:40 +tomik: emerged 0.8.15, and after $ irssi all it says is Segmentation Fault
00:41 +tomik: anyway to get some logs about it?
00:41 +tomik: to check the error
00:41 +shabble: does irssi --help crash as well?
00:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v contempt]
00:47 * Bazerka calls hand-edited config file
00:47 +Bazerka: ;)
00:47 * Geert seconds
00:51 +cromag: i cant be ulra awsoem all the time..
00:52 +cromag: and i can't type either..
00:52 +tomik: shabble: that works, guess it crashes when trying to enter gui
00:53 +shabble: tomik: mkdir ~/irssi-test; irssi --home=~/irssi-test
00:53 +shabble: does that work?
00:53 +Bazerka: no need for the makedir, it'll auto-create
00:54 +shabble: oh, ok
00:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v icedearth]
00:54 +tomik: seems like yes, iam in an empty irssi window
00:54 +shabble: ok, then you've got a borken config file. Did you edit it by hand at any point?
00:54 +Bazerka: tomik: can you mail me a copy of your broken config to bazerka -at- irssi.org please?
00:54 +Bazerka: hash out any sensitive info, but leave all lines as they are
00:55 +icedearth: does anyone have their beep working?
00:56 +icedearth: cant get mine to work
00:56 +shabble: it's down to how your terminal responds to the BEL charater, really
00:56 +icedearth: oh
00:57 +tomik: Bazerka shabble
00:57 +tomik: i had a working 0.8.12
00:57 +tomik: and the other root was playing with libs
00:57 +tomik: and i got
00:57 +tomik: some lib error at start
00:57 +tomik: then i guess he recomplied perl
00:58 +tomik: and i got segmment fault from then, so i reinstalled as 0-8-15
00:58 +tomik: no config edit
00:58 +tomik: i saved my old scripts from .irssi
00:58 +tomik: but those are hidden now for irssi i guess
00:58 +Bazerka: ok, so try this :
00:58 +Bazerka: rename your config file and start irssi
00:59 +Bazerka: this will still load any scripts you have set to auto run
00:59 +Bazerka: if it doesn't segfault, you do have a broken config and I'd like a copy of it
00:59 +Bazerka: all these config related segfaults need to be fixed
01:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
01:01 +shabble: or write a more robust config parser to begin with :P
01:01 +tomik: hm ye i still have old .irssi dir
01:01 +tomik: with the config
01:01 +Bazerka: shabble: we await your patches with a new config parser contained therein :)
01:02 +shabble: Bazerka: excellent, everyone loves XML, right?
01:03 +Bazerka: the new parser must be able to read/write the existing format
01:03 +tomik: so i guess i need to owerrite my old config from the new irssi-test
01:03 +Bazerka: (and only that format) :)
01:03 +tomik: and u want my old?
01:04 +shabble: Bazerka: spoilsport!
01:04 +Bazerka: tomik: did you try it with your existing scripts but a clean config yet?
01:04 +Bazerka: need to rule the scripts out being the cause
01:04 +Bazerka: if it works with your scripts and a clean config, then yes, I'd like a copy of your "broken" old config
01:04 +Bazerka: (ie, the config causing the segfault)
01:06 +shabble: I wonder if you could write a little fuzzer that removes random bits of a working config and checks for segfaults.
01:09 +tomik: Bazerka: nope. its not working if i overwrite it. cleared the whole dir now and used the new so its working now with simple $irssi
01:09 +tomik: too bad i remember i had a hard time setting up a nicklist
01:10 +ahf: shabble: should be fairly easy to write.
01:10 +ahf: if we ever are to switch format, then we probably could do something naughty like having both parsers for a while, load in the old format if present, then serialize and save to a new format and remove the old one
01:10 +ahf: and if we switch to something new then clearly it should be xml!
01:10 +shabble: I could even automate it to send all the broken configs straight to Bazerka!
01:11 +Bazerka: yeah right
01:11 +shabble: I'd go with YAML, personally.
01:11 +Bazerka: I'd go with libconfig
01:11 +shabble: although that would probably also get messy with the amount of embedding that happens
01:11 +ahf: i'd go with yaml too, probably
01:11 +ahf: or an active language.
01:11 +Bazerka: libconfig is pretty much close to what it is already
01:12 +Bazerka: but with all the bugs gone :)
01:12 +Bazerka: and far easier to migrate to
01:12 * ahf mutters something about lua
01:12 +ahf: :P
01:12 +Bazerka: a script dep for core? not a chance
01:12 +shabble: libconfig looks a lot like what you have already
01:12 +ahf: pffffffffff. everyone else is doing that these days!
01:12 +shabble: on, you said that :p
01:13 +ahf: but yeah, libconfig is probably the way

01:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v atxq]
01:21 +atxq: so I want to block all messages telling me that someone has join r quit the channel. actually wanted to block it on the irssi config file
01:22 +shabble: atxq: /help ignore
01:22 +atxq: can someone tell me what I need to add to the config file so that I can block these messages from showing up in irssi?
01:23 +shabble: also, /topic
01:23 +atxq: they tell me the command, but I want to actually configure it
01:23 +shabble: use the command, then use /save.
01:23 +shabble: all the ignoring fun, none of those pesky segfaults
01:24 +shabble: it's a win-win!
01:24 +atxq: so I run the command in irssi, then /save?
01:24 +shabble: yep
01:24 +atxq: will it also save the channels that I am connected to?
01:25 +shabble: not afaik. There's a handy alias I found: /alias ADDALLCHAN script exec foreach my \$channel (Irssi::channels()) { Irssi::command("channel add -auto \$channel->{name} \$channel->{server}->{tag} \$channel->{key}")\;}
01:26 +shabble: run that before save
01:26 +shabble: well, that creates the alias - then run the alias with /addallchan
01:28 +atxq: \/IGNORE -regexp -pattern "is (away|gone|back)" * ACTION
01:28 +atxq: this would work too, right?
01:28 +shabble: that'll block those /me is away messages, but not joins/quits
01:28 +atxq: away, gone, back...is there more than these three?
01:29 +shabble: you want /ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS
01:29 +atxq: add join and quit to the list then?
01:29 +shabble: replace the * with #channel if it's only for a specific place
01:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
01:29 +atxq: thanks shabble
01:30 +atxq: it is just annoying to have to see all those messages
01:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v v_v]
01:30 +shabble: yeah, in busy channels it''s a pain
01:30 +v_v: hello, any gui nofify script for irssi ?
01:30 +shabble: you can still use /names or try to tab complete someone to see if they're still there
01:30 +atxq: if I want to know if a certain user is still in the channel, I can just list all the users and check I guess
01:31 +atxq: exactly
01:31 +atxq: and what is the command to leave a particular channel?
01:36 +bremner:  /part
01:38 +atxq: thanks bremner
01:42 +zagabar: Can I somehow set the autoclose_query so that it closes queries automatically after X seconds, but ignores some query windows that I want to keep open all the time?

02:00 +happyface: so annoying
02:02 +cromag: /ignore
02:02 +cromag: /help ignore would be a start.

02:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v angstrom]
02:05 --- peth_ is now known as peth
02:06 +angstrom: is there a way to ensure that I'm unable to join channels when I'm not registered with services (i.e., no hostname cloak etc)?
02:14 +lestat: angstrom: try to use an unregistered nick ?
02:19 +angstrom: lestat: when I have connection problems I find myself "getting unregistered". I have to manually re-register then. what I'd prefer in such a situation is rather being unable to rejoin channels, or, even better, have irssi automatically re-register my nick before rejoining channels. does that make sense?
02:19 +Iceman_B: how do I start logging for a specific channel?
02:19 +Iceman_B: until I deem enought
02:19 +Iceman_B: -t
02:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Anthoo]
02:29 +Iceman_B: how does /log start differ from /log open ?
02:30 +Bazerka:  /help log
02:30 +Bazerka: look at the syntax
02:30 +Bazerka:  /log start only supports and ID (of an existing configured log) or a filename
02:30 +Bazerka: *an
02:31 +Bazerka: so, /log (start|stop|close) is pretty much for logs already /log open'd (or autologged)
02:33 +Iceman_B: hurr
02:33 * Iceman_B dont get it
02:34 +Iceman_B: what i want is to start logging a channel in a window i already haven open
02:34 +Iceman_B: and just have irssi figure out the filename
02:34 +Iceman_B: how do I do that?
02:34 +Bazerka: it's quite simply really
02:35 +Bazerka:  /log (start|stop|close) can only refer to logs that are already in your /log list
02:35 +Bazerka:  /log open is how you put new logs into that list
02:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CEnTR4L]
02:35 +Bazerka: (or automatically via autologging)
02:35 +Bazerka: you can't /log (start|stop|close) a non-existant log
02:37 +Iceman_B: autologging grabs all open windows, no?
02:37 +Bazerka: autologging grabs whatever you configure it to
02:38 +Bazerka: or rather, it grabs everything except what you tell it not to
02:38 +Bazerka:  /set autolog
02:39 +Bazerka: if you're not auto-logging and only want to log a specific window, then /log open is what you want
02:39 +Iceman_B: ok
02:39 +Iceman_B: that *is* what i want

14:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]

14:03 +Remco: What does perl --version give you?
14:03 +shabble: or just blindly re-emerge perl and irssi and hope for the best :)
14:03 +Remco: Most importantly, does the version match the one irssi is linking to?
14:07 +tomik: perl is (v5.12.2)

14:54 +Ceelvain: How does irssi detect netsplits ?
14:58 +ahf: Ceelvain: it checks the quit message of the clients :P
14:58 +lestat: otherside: ? o_o
14:58 +lestat: erf i meant ahf
14:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v KB1JWQ]

15:18 +Ceelvain: ahf: yes but it also need some kind of timer. Idem for rejoin after split.
15:18 +ahf: Ceelvain: it uses the same logic that it uses for stacking mode-changes together
15:19 +ahf: if you do:
15:19 +ahf: MODE #foo +o a
15:19 +ahf: MODE #foo +o b
15:19 +ahf: MODE #foo +o c
15:19 +ahf: then irssi will show you mode #foo +ooo a b c
15:19 +Ceelvain: You CAN do MODE #foo +ooo a b c
15:19 +ahf: yes, that was not the point
15:19 +ahf: irssi stacks modes together if it can.
15:19 +Ceelvain: ok.
15:20 +ahf: such that you wont see multiple lines of modechanges if you can avoid it.
15:21 +Ceelvain: then, if the server doesn't add "Quit" before the quit message, I could fake a netsplit for irssi. Right ?

15:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mavrc]
15:23 +Ceelvain: mavrc: the same as #hzv ?
15:24 +ahf: Ceelvain: it's the ircd that prefixes your comment with "Quit: "
15:25 +ahf: that logic is in modules/core/m_quit.c of the ircd codebase.
15:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v altur]
15:25 +mavrc: Ceelvain: yes :)
15:26 +mavrc: Ceelvain: who are you on #hzv?

15:28 +Ceelvain: Well, about "Quit: " prefix, I think I can remember of an option for unrealircd that let customize it. And I also see a couple of servers without prefix.
15:29 +ahf: for actually client quits with a message?
15:30 +Ceelvain: set::prefix-quit
15:30 +ahf: oh well, fuck unrealircd :P
15:30 +ahf: nobody uses that on large networks anyway :P
15:30 +Ceelvain: everybody use that on small and medium networks. :)
15:31 +ahf: yes, sadly
15:31 +ahf: i'm on one network that uses it.

15:49 +Genieliu: Bazerka: Thx,I got it
15:49 +Bazerka: np
15:50 +tomik: dont have gdb seems liek
15:51 +Bazerka: why do you need gdb to correctly build irssi against the right perl libs? :)
15:52 +tomik: got that advice to use that
15:52 +Bazerka: to do what?
15:52 +tomik: to track my segfault error
15:52 +Bazerka: it will just point to something perl related and won't provide any useful information
15:53 +Bazerka: the problem is building irssi's perl module correctly
15:54 +tomik: well i've installed it from emerge so it should build it correctly
15:54 +tomik: seems like it didnt
15:54 +Bazerka: that's not strictly true
15:55 +Bazerka: given that you've said someone with root has been messing around with libs, you don't know what state the machine is in
15:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v icedearth]
15:55 +Bazerka: and if emerge is building stuff correctly at all
15:55 +Bazerka: s/and/or/
15:56 +tomik: but if perl was preinstalled it should correctly link irssi after or?
15:56 +Bazerka: if soemone has been messing around with perl libs, all bets are off
15:56 +Bazerka: until you get the system back into a known state
15:57 +tomik: sigh
15:58 +Bazerka: personally, I'd deinstall perl and its libs, then manually remove any perl related crap left over
15:58 +Bazerka: then once you know you've cleaned all perl related stuff, re-emerge perl and its dev libs
15:58 +Bazerka: then re-emerge irssi
15:59 +Bazerka: or whatever the correct gentoo terminology is :)
15:59 +tomik: will do that i guess
15:59 +tomik: that is

16:41 +\ottizen: 22:29 <+\ottizen> Irssi: warning SSL handshake failed: sslv3 alert handshake failure
16:43 +Bazerka: which version of irssi and where were you connecting to that generates that error?
16:44 +\ottizen: Latest stable, connected to irc.operatorstat.us.
16:44 +\ottizen: Port 6697.
16:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pix|]
16:45 +Bazerka: latest stable being 0.8.15?
16:47 +pix|: Bazerka:
16:47 +\ottizen: Yes.
16:47 +pix|: .
16:47 +pix|: yes
16:47 +Bazerka: \ottizen: it seems to be a problem with that server
16:48 +Bazerka: I get that error connecting directly with OpenSSL's s_client
16:48 +\ottizen: It's my own server, so, uh, do you know what it might be?

16:49 +pix|: anyone an idea what could cause highlighted I letters at the end of an msg?
16:49 +Bazerka: pix|: inverted I's are how irssi displays the tab character
16:50 +mquin: pix|: if it's a string of higlighted I's and spaces then the other person is using OTR
16:51 +pix|: Bazerka: ah, thx. Is there a case where tabs are appended unintentionally?
16:51 +\ottizen: mquin: Hello
16:51 +\ottizen: Bazerka: Thank you.
16:52 +mquin: 'lo \ottizen
16:52 +Bazerka: pix|: only if that's what the person is sending
16:52 +Bazerka: irssi won't add them to incoming or outgoing text
16:53 +icedearth: whats the best script for getting notifications if you are accessing irssi over ssh?
16:57 +pix|: Well, if I type a tab then nothing happens but stating the tab-completion. From some people, however, I sometimes get those blinking I characters and they don't know why.
16:57 +pix|: starting*
16:58 +Bazerka: that's because you're receiving tabs *FROM* them
16:58 +Bazerka: (if you're talking about inverted I's appearing in lines from other people)
16:59 +Bazerka: there's a couple of scripts that will strip them out if they annoy you and people can't fix sending them
17:00 +mquin: there's a tab_stop script, or you can do the same with a trigger rule (it's one of the examples)
17:01 +pix|: yep found it, thx
17:05 +pix|: but the trigger script is even better :)
