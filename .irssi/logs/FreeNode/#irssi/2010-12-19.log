18:50 +Nei: if you're invisible and delay autojoining until cloaked this is unlikely
18:50 +Nei: the best you can get is put your password as server password, that will idenitfy you on freendoe
18:52 +grawity: the best you can get is SASL
18:52 +Nei: I doubt that will be "faster" in any way
18:52 +tmr: You're almost hour late, he couldn't be arsed to wait over minute.
18:53 +grawity: Nei: After requesting SASL, the registration phase only ends after the client authenticates and sends "CAP END"
18:53 +Nei: oops :>
18:53 +grawity: Nei: Server password, on the other hand, is translated server-side to "PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY %s"
18:53 +Nei: the registration phase is the reg phase, but the sasl needs to get throught to nickserv in some way too
18:53 +grawity: So while server password is a little faster than an -autosendcmd, it doesn't always help.
18:54 +Nei: who knows if sasl isnt translated to some shady privmsg as well
18:54 +grawity: It's handled by SaslServ, actually
18:54 +grawity: And you always get a "success" or "failed" response
18:55 +Nei: but when will the cloak be activated etc
18:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Godslastering]
18:55 +grawity: It will be as soon as authentication is finished
18:56 +Nei: the server password could be improved to work in the same fashion
18:56 +Nei: nothing inherent about sasl
18:56 +grawity: Patches welcome. :>
19:00 +Godslastering: um i'm in a tty (no WM) so when i alt-arrow it switches to next tty, is there a way to go to next/prev chan otherwise?
19:00 +grawity: Godslastering: ^P ^N
19:00 +Godslastering: i know alt and a number/letter works, but i'd prefer to just cycle
19:00 +Godslastering: thanks grawity
19:01 +grawity: Nei: as can be seen from http://dpaste.com/288342/, registration doesn't finish until "CAP END", giving time to authenticate

19:28 +tmr: One of the scripts designed to do that probably.
19:28 +Godslastering: could you point me to one, tmr ?
19:29 +Remco: Or screens copy mode
19:29 +Godslastering: Remco: what is screens copy mode?

19:54 +NMF: *?
19:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jkyle]
19:55 +NMF: Or just if anyone want to help me configuring tor + irssi
19:55 +jkyle: when I start up irssi, I end up with a blank window, no channels joined. All the channels I specify _do_ autojoin, so it's not a failed channel join or something.
19:55 +jkyle: I tried /win close <chan num>, then /save the config. but it pops back up
19:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v bluegene]
19:56 +tmr: jkyle, use /layout save before /saving if you have saved your layout before.
19:56 +jkyle: k, let me restart
19:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jkyle]
19:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jkyle]
19:58 +jkyle: cool, got it. and figured out how it was cropping up to. If I join a channel not in my autojoin and save layout, it just opens that window as blank. So I had to /part all the channels not in my autojoin, then /save layout :P

21:21 +billnye: tweefari: that's not what I asked :)
21:23 +tweefari: billnye, I see ? ? ?
21:26 +billnye: the font I'm using is rather limited, so those 3 in particular were ?s to me but your åƒ example above came through fine
21:26 +billnye: but again, I don't think you've responded to my actual test/suggestion/question.
21:27 +tweefari: billnye, I'm on Mac OS X; so, UTF-8 is very well supported.
21:28 +tweefari: billnye, I have tested a bunch of characters that show up fine everywhere else, except in themes.
21:29 +billnye: that, at least, is approaching the question I asked
21:31 +billnye: are ALL utf characters in the theme affected by the issue, or only SOME?
21:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tnbt23]
21:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon__]
21:33 +Koffa: why are teh logs affected by _my_ charset settings?
21:33 +Koffa: if it's a feature, what's the logic?
21:34 +billnye: Koffa: by what charset setting?
21:34 +tweefari: billnye, ALL utf-8 characters.
21:34 +tweefari: billnye, I've tested multiple themes.
21:34 +Koffa: billnye: I used iso-8859-1 until I recently changed to wtf8... now the logs are mixed up with both
21:35 +Koffa: making them impossible to read with any setting
21:35 +Koffa: I doubt that all other ppl have change their charsets at the same time :)
21:36 +billnye: Koffa: as an amateur interpretation, I would expect the recode /set-tings to affect the logs as well, and the term_charset not to have any effect
21:36 +Koffa: dunno if those can be fixed anymore since they're mixed
21:37 +billnye: ☃
21:37 +billnye: teehee, I just found arbitrary unicode support in screen's digraph mode
21:37 +tweefari: billnye, I see that character.

21:38 +Koffa: there's a frigging snowman but no trollface?-o
21:38 +billnye: tweefari: I would guess that you probably match that bug, and might be able to contribue the (possibly-)useful info that all unicode chars are affected and not just some
21:39 +billnye: Koffa: >8]
21:39 +mauke: ツ
21:39 +Koffa: oh ffs
21:42 +Bazerka: ी
21:45 +Koffa: is that a single char?
21:46 +Koffa: it's sick and retarded that you can break the physical boundaries of fixed width fonts
21:46 +Bazerka: it's a single char, yes (afaik)
21:46 +mauke: http://mauke.ath.cx/stuff/javascript/unicode.html?q=ी
21:46 +mauke: well, my font doesn't have it
21:47 +Bazerka: and it consumes the same width as any other character here
21:47 +Koffa: as with that smiley face... as wide as my "oh"
21:47 +Koffa: it's like anal rape with a cactus
21:47 +mauke: ｏｈ， ｔｈａｔ
21:48 +Koffa: http://koffa.net/pics/fuckwtf8.png
21:49 +mauke: Koffa: your font is failing
21:50 +Koffa: there aren't that many readable
21:50 +mauke: that dotted circle is used in the unicode pdfs to explain the location of the base character
21:50 +mauke: it's not supposed to be part of the combining character
21:50 +Koffa: tell me a good font :)
21:50 +Koffa: one will suffice :)
21:50 +mauke: DejaVu Sans Mono
21:51 +Koffa: guess what I have :D
21:52 +mauke: what the
21:52 +mauke: it doesn't do that here
21:52 +Koffa: dejavu sans mono book 9pt
21:52 +mauke:  ̈
21:52 +Koffa: are you saying your smiley face is also 1char wide for you?
21:52 +mauke: what do you see?
21:53 +Koffa: looks like orphan umlauts
21:53 +billnye: with nothing after it, I can't gauge width on the singlechars
21:53 +mauke: correct
21:53 +Koffa: billnye: above/below
21:53 +billnye: but on my end the "oh, that" was about 1.5char spacing
21:54 +billnye: Koffa: as I said, without anything next to it to judge by, I can't tell
21:54 +Koffa: like my screenshot, the "face" is as wide as "oh"
21:54 +Koffa: ツ
21:54 +Koffa: oh
21:54 +billnye: it's wider than o but not as wide as h
21:54 +billnye: on my end
21:54 +Koffa: which font?
21:55 +billnye: not the same as you guys
21:55 +mauke: Koffa: http://mauke.ath.cx/tmp/screenshot.png
21:55 +billnye: looking closely the ohthat might be exact doublewide
21:56 +billnye: but again, without something afterward to delimit, it's hard to gauge single characters :)  (was my only point)
21:56 +Koffa: whoa
21:56 +Koffa: now when I scroll back my own lines the face "sticks" to screen
21:56 +mauke: it's not a face :-)
21:57 +Koffa: I know
21:57 +Koffa: but it looks like one
21:57 +Koffa: http://koffa.net/pics/fuckwtf8_2.png
21:58 +Koffa: that "face" and the text have never been on the same line
21:58 +billnye: UNTIL NOW
21:58 +billnye: ladies and gentlemen, step right up, bear witness to the miracle of the ages
21:58 +Koffa: ^L fixes it, but still...
21:58 +Koffa: nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure
21:58 +mauke: what terminal are you using?
21:58 +Koffa: gnome-term
21:58 +mauke: urxvt here
21:59 +billnye: single characters as wide as two others... disembodied heads that seem to float free and of their own accord!
21:59 +Koffa: E: Package 'urxvt' has no installation candidate
21:59 +mauke: rxvt-unicode
21:59 +Koffa: installing

22:00 +Koffa: aaaaaaaaaaaaarggh my eyes
22:00 +Koffa: white bg
22:00 +billnye: mauke: nice, that one ate its leading space instead of trailing
22:00 +MinceR: today, on Wonders of Unicode :>
22:00 +billnye: MinceR: there's another codepoint born every minute.
22:00 +MinceR: :)
22:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peleg]
22:01 +Koffa: ok, on urxvt the "face" doesn't stay there, but it does generate a non-existent space in front of the "like ..." line
22:01 +Koffa: how can one really use these chars if no terminal even remotely support them?
22:01 +MinceR: that katakana character works fine here
22:01 +Koffa: it's like having a car that randomly loses a tire
22:02 +Koffa: MinceR: did you type it and then scroll back and forth in your command history?
22:02 +MinceR: perhaps the right thing to do would be to filter the code points that do nasty things like this
22:02 +MinceR: not yet
22:02 +MinceR: still works fine

22:48 +Ruint: my shell's locale is set to en_us.utf-8 but i'd rather not use it, since an annoyance on some network i use has a script to break terms that use utf-8; i've set term_charset to ISO-8859-1 but i imagine i'm doing it wrong, since i get a lot of characters not displaying right (ie £ shows as i  with umalot, upside down ?, 1/2 symbol,
22:48 +Ruint: how2fix :/
22:49 +Ruint: or would i hav to ask my shell provider to include the charset i want in /etc/default/locale ?
22:49 +mauke: how do you break terms that use utf-8?
22:50 +Ruint: no idea
22:50 +mauke: define "break"
22:52 +Ruint: eh, term is covered with weird symbols, i'm not about to track down said  annoyance and subject myself to it to provide you a screenshot, though :/
22:53 +mauke: just wondering if I'm that annoyance
22:58 +Ruint: orite
23:00 +ArmOrAttAk: otay
23:01 +Ruint: iirc, it's a bunch of newline chars and other stupid things, but if i ever bothered to ask, i don't remember
23:06 +Ruint: mauke: feel free to find gnaa on irc and ask incog for his script, i'm sue he'll willingly demonstrate it to you, then come demonstrate it to me in thanks, at leas 10,000 times
23:06 +Ruint: he's nice like that
23:07 +Ruint: <3
23:07 +nightfrog: Why have a middle man?
23:07 +Ruint: because the on in the middle has the most fun
23:07 +Ruint: one^
23:08 +Ruint: and mauke is the one who seems curious
23:09 +Ruint: and incog is some sort of france apologetic, masquerading as a brit :(
23:09 +Ruint: sad but true
23:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Fuuko]
23:09 +Fuuko: Yes hello again
23:10 +Ruint: ohi
23:10 +Fuuko: Is it possible to change the timezone of irssi without editing config/restarting?
23:10 +Death4Life: yes it is
23:10 +Fuuko: Lovely. With /set, I assume?
23:10 +Fuuko: or whatever it is
23:11 +mauke: /script exec $ENV{TZ} = "something"
23:11 +Death4Life: /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'PST';
23:11 +mauke: maybe
23:11 +Death4Life: something like that
23:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fox20052]
23:11 +Fuuko: ok, so...
23:12 +Fuuko:  /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'AST'; would change to atlantic standard, right?
23:12 +Fuuko: at least, that's the objective here.
23:12 +Sedated: Fuuko, technically you're changing the timezone for the shell that irssi is running in.  if you want to change it for all your login sessions, you can export TZ="/usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Melbourne" in .bashrc or .bash_profile
23:14 +Fuuko: alright. So, running the command
23:14 +Fuuko: I don't see any changes
23:14 +Sedated: try using teh full path to the tz
23:15 +mauke: what did you expect?
23:15 +Fuuko: Well, assuming it worked, I was expecting my timezone in irssi to be switched to AST
23:15 +Sedated: actually, this worked for me:
23:15 +Sedated:  /script exec $ENV{'TZ'}="AST"
23:15 +Fuuko: Oh
23:15 +mauke: Fuuko: which has what effect?
23:15 +Sedated:  /script exec $ENV{'TZ'}='/usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Melbourne'
23:15 +Sedated: sorry
23:16 +Death4Life: /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'Europe/Brussels'; < this works fine here too...
23:17 +Fuuko: oh
23:17 +Fuuko: looks like it worked
23:17 +mauke: you don't need the ' ' around TZ, btw
23:17 +Fuuko:  /script exec $ENV{'TZ'}='America/Halifax' worked for me
23:19 +Fuuko: Anywho
23:19 +Fuuko: thank you very much, once again
23:33 +Godslastering: how does one check the ram usage?
23:33 +Godslastering: of irssi that is
23:34 +rudi_s: Godslastering: ps ux | grep irssi
23:34 +Godslastering: rudi_s: i thought there was a way within irssi, though
23:34 +rudi_s: Godslastering: Why should there be one?
23:34 +Godslastering: rudi_s: i didn't say there should be i said i thought there was
23:35 +rudi_s: Godslastering: Then the answer is, AFAIK there isn't.
23:35 +ferret: most of the ram usage is due to scrollback, and you can check that
23:35 +Godslastering: ferret: that may be what i was referring to, how do you check that?
23:35 +ferret: /scrollback status
23:35 +rudi_s: ferret: Interesting, I didn't know that command. Thanks.
