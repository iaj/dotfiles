04:36 +jspiros: Lately, I've had an issue where per-channel logs don't work consistently well
04:36 +jspiros: meaning that logs/freenode/channel/year/month/day.log might not exist for a given day
04:36 +jspiros: but logs/freenode/*/year/month/day.log will exist, and will contain everything from all of the channels that didn't have their own log
04:36 +jspiros: And it seems intermittent, meaning one day it happens, another day it works as it should, etc.
04:38 +jspiros: The issue of course is that the * log is undifferentiable
05:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v culb]
05:09 +Bazerka: jspiros: it's a known bug that's been fixed a few versions back - either upgrade or use the workaround which is to add -SNOTES to autolog_level
05:10 +Bazerka: preferably the former :)

05:23 +ik: ok
05:24 +ik: activity_hide_level = joins parts quits modes nicks
05:24 +ik: but my statusbar still fills up after a while with the light-coloured (or whatever you want to call it) numbers which aren't privmsgs or notices
05:24 +ik: what'd I miss?
05:28 +Bazerka: nothing
05:28 +Bazerka: are you using any of the activity scripts? (chanact, awl, etc?)
05:32 +ik: neg
05:33 +ik: I think I know, actually. Recently the router this shell is behind has been flaking and reconnecting frequently- so it's either my own join is differentiated from 'JOINS', or the topic/nick list/sync notification/etc that you get on channel join
05:33 +ik: s/connecting/booting/
05:34 +Bazerka: not sure what they fall under - may be worth running printlevels.pl to see what you need to add

09:08 +L0stm4n: question: I idle with irssi in a screen alot. I check IRC a few times a month maybe. An old friend on an old IRC network has been contacting me once in a while but I always miss him. Would there be some way I could do some sort of on join msg or auto reply to just that nick on just that irc network?
09:09 +L0stm4n: I would like to give him some current contact info besides this old IRC channel
09:10 +Dirm: probably safest to use trigger.pl
09:10 +L0stm4n: Dirm, thanks I'll look into it
09:11 +Dirm: there are away scripts that give you an autoreply but that would send it to people other than him, too
09:11 +vague`: /trigger help once you've loaded the script
09:11 +Dirm: would be easier, but don't know how secret your message is
09:11 +L0stm4n: nothing terribly secret
09:11 +L0stm4n: more just "hey long time no see, I idle here but am usually afk. send me and email at blah blah blah"
09:15 +L0stm4n: That should get me on the right path. I'll have to make sure I dont end up spamming people or doing it across networks. I'm a pretty crappy programmer
09:15 +L0stm4n: but that gets me on the right track
09:15 +L0stm4n: thanks :)
09:16 +Dirm: I'd just add a trigger for that one guy's hostmask to send him a message with the info
09:16 +Dirm: also I assume that network doesn't have any kind of memoserv?
09:16 +L0stm4n: ...shit you know what
09:16 +L0stm4n: it might
09:16 +Dirm: though I don't know how often people miss those
09:16 +Dirm: if the notification just shows up in login notice spam or something
09:17 +L0stm4n: yeah nobody reads that shit
09:17 +Dirm: it might send it as a separate message though
09:17 +Dirm: I seem to recall noticing a memo at one point
09:17 +Dirm: anyway easily enough tested
09:18 +L0stm4n: I think the trigger.pl should work for me. I know his nick and his isp has been the same each time. I can narrow it down to that. regardless of network that should do
09:18 +L0stm4n: not like I'm transfering state secrets here
09:18 +L0stm4n: last time I missed him by like 2 hours

18:09 +Koffa: guru meditation
18:09 +Koffa: "both" ?
18:10 +lyindArk: desikitteh{G}{H}: it's a pseudo irc server which is itself a client for various other im networks, acts as a gateway. it's great.

18:15 +desikitteh{G}{H}: more stable connection, sorry.
18:15 +desikitteh{G}{H}: my brain is migraine-addled.
18:15 +Koffa: I wouldn't use a shared one... ymmv
18:15 +desikitteh{G}{H}: it's a private server.
18:15 +desikitteh{G}{H}: limited number of people know the addy.
18:16 +lyindArk: desikitteh{G}{H}: to me it looks like the bitlbee instances are well isolated after being launced via xinetd.
18:16 * desikitteh{G}{H} nods to lyindArk.
18:16 +desikitteh{G}{H}: i just find it a little annoying that i lose my IMs when i use other comps.
18:18 +lyindArk: desikitteh{G}{H}: hm... maybe use a web-based irc client? i've seen people using it all day (school, work).
18:21 +desikitteh{G}{H}: eww.

18:37 +Ticho: msgnick
18:37 +Koffa: did it for pubmsg =  but should it be at pubnick = ?
18:38 +billnye: the right-align tip should list the settings that you need to change
18:39 +Koffa: no way to do it with a single option?
18:39 +Ticho: msgnick
18:42 +jetole: Hey guys. I have tried a few different ways of running "/last -word 5322" with different quotes around 5322 but each time I do, I get: -!- Irssi: /LASTLOG would print 3902 lines. If you really want to print all these lines use -force option.
18:43 +Koffa: let's see
18:43 +Koffa: hope it works now :)
18:43 +billnye: jetole: /last 5322 -

18:44 +Koffa: nope
18:45 +Koffa: if I poke with the msgnick definition the nick is just lost... doing it anywhere else would require several entries to be modified
18:48 +Ticho: you're doing something sinister to that abstract then - i have modified it long time ago and no nick was lost :>
18:52 +billnye: jetole: you can do "/last - 5322 -" if you don't want to bother with remembering what does and doesn't work :D
