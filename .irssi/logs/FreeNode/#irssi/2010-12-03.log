14:14 +FranciscoD: exec -msg <channel> <command> puts the output into the channel, how do I send it to a particular nick in the channel?
14:14 +Rhonda: FranciscoD: /exec -o echo -n "nick: "; other stuff?
14:14 +Rhonda: ls /dev/null
14:14 +Rhonda: bleah :)
14:14 +FranciscoD: Rhonda: let me try

14:17 +FranciscoD: Rhonda: here's what I'm trying to do
14:17 +FranciscoD: Rhonda: /exec -m #fedora lsusb | fpaste , would send the resultant link to #fedora,
14:18 +FranciscoD: and I want it to go "nick: " with the link
14:18 +nightfrog: Good luck

20:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hellburner]
20:17 +hellburner: Is there a way to change the status bar so that for a specific channel it displays something else?
20:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v DigitallyBorn]
20:30 +billnye: hellburner: in what sense?
20:30 +billnye: hellburner: specific requests are more likely to get specific results :D
20:31 +hellburner: for example [20:30] [+hellburner(+Zi)] [4:freenode/#irssi(+Pcgnt)] ... could I get the freenode/#irssi part to say something different for #irssi but stay the same for #another_channel ?
20:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mirko]
20:33 +billnye: that's a step in the right direction info-wise, but still maybe a few paces away... so far the answer is "not without some scripting" but a) what info would you want to display? and b) what is your aim in doing so?
20:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shad0wgen]
20:42 +hellburner: billnye: prevent shoulder surfers from seeing what channel I'm in
20:42 +hellburner: and anything unoffensive would be a fine replacement
20:43 +bremner: and the channel content?
20:44 +hellburner: The content isn't what's the problem, the channel name is was intended as a joke, but people are taking it literally
20:44 +billnye: :D http://www.irssi.org/themefiles/c0ders.png
20:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shad0wgen]
20:44 +billnye: oh, if the content isn't the problem... :)
20:46 +hellburner: you know the joke that the internet is all (only) about porn?  Well someone made a channel with porn in it's name, since we're on the internet therefore all we talk about is porn.
20:46 +hellburner: even though in that channel we rarely talk about porn.
20:46 +hellburner: but seeing "porn" on the status bar might cause me problems
20:46 +bremner: but now porn is in this channel
20:46 +hellburner: it's in it's name, but not in the discussion
20:47 +billnye: bremner: ONOES
20:47 +bremner: exactly
20:47 +znx: hellburner: use numbers instead of channel names
20:47 +hellburner: znx: how?
20:47 +billnye: hellburner: what's the actual channel name?
20:48 +hellburner: billnye: why?
20:48 +billnye: trying to see if there's a "dumb" fix.
20:49 +hellburner: well, if I said the name, and someone in here was offended, it would defeat the purpose
20:49 +bremner: #child-porn-jihad
20:49 +hellburner: not quite that offensive
20:49 +billnye: right now your solution is to write a custom script that duplicates the functionality of the current statusbar item but filters for the string
20:50 +hellburner: I thought as much
20:50 +znx: hellburner: /toggle actlist_names
20:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tg]
20:51 +billnye: or to strip the info from all windows, or to theme it to a barely-discernable shade so shoulder surfing isn't likely to result in reading any channel name
20:51 +hellburner: znx: doesn't seem to make a difference
20:51 +bremner: act_listnames=off, still leaves the current channel name
20:51 +billnye: hellburner: that's the state of the matter as I see it and with the info you've been willing to provide
20:51 +znx: hellburner: you must be using a script in statusbar
20:52 +hellburner: if I am it's part of the server.
20:52 +billnye: znx: the window statusbar info, not the act list
20:52 +znx: oh
20:52 +znx: sorry
20:52 +billnye: :)
20:52 +hellburner: Alright then, thank you
20:52 +billnye: hellburner: that's not the end of the help, just the dead end you've painted us into :)
20:52 +bremner: hellburner: ps, thought about changing your nick, if you live/work with such thin skinned people?
20:53 +hellburner: Hellburner is a reference to a book
20:54 +hellburner: It's more of people who are offended by categories.  Hard to explain the mentality, it makes no sense, but I have to tolerate them.
20:54 +billnye: hellburner: but obviously no, there's no /set filter_irssi_content_possibly_offensive_to_some_people on
20:54 +bremner: billnye: lies. it's called /quit
20:54 +hellburner: well, if you could limit the number of characters displayed for the channel ame that would work
20:54 +hellburner: name
20:56 +billnye: hellburner: hence my question, O recalcitrant one
20:57 +hellburner: it's #wellknown_FOSS_project_with_an_6_character_name-p0rn so an 8 character limitation would make it #xxxxxx-p
20:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peleg]
20:57 +hellburner: Is that possible?
20:57 * bremner is offended
20:57 +bremner: by the mention of gnome
20:57 +hellburner: it's not gnome.
20:57 +hellburner: and that's 5 characters
20:57 +bremner: oops
20:58 +billnye: hellburner: there's still no way to apply it SELECTIVELY, but yes http://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars
20:58 +hellburner: ooo, thank you
20:59 +billnye: and now you see what I said earlier about info in assistance out.
