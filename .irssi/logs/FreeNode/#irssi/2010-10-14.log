00:10 +billnye: is that housekeeping on script load/unload?
00:11 +billnye: I'm heading out from work now, I swear :<
00:11 --- oracle_ is now known as destroyacle
00:11 +yitz_: What housekeeping?
00:12 +dngor: I get the impression that everyone's waiting for everyone else on ack.pl.  I created http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack/tree/billnye and http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack/tree/yitz so the changes don't get lost.
00:12 +yitz_: the add/del is for the priority hack, where you can build a list of channels with a higher sort priority on a temp basis. You can push certain channels to that list. add/del are commands to handle the list/setting/string
00:12 +billnye: dngor: I'll be learning how to work git and brushing up on some perl before my branch gets pushed :)
00:13 +dngor: I'd prefer people to fork and edit, though, so the attributions are correct.
00:13 +yitz_: dngor: I think the pastebin I submitted should include all the features to date
00:13 +shabble: billnye: progit.org/book
00:13 +dngor: progit++
00:13 +shabble: just reading it now, as it happens
00:14 +billnye: I'm a lazy excuse for a computer geek, who can read several languages and program in approximately none of them :)
00:14 +yitz_: lol
00:14 +ferret: I'm not interested in actually, you know, doing any work for a script I have no use for, but if you want to use any of the implementation bits I mentioned feel free :p
00:14 +ferret: I prefer to just criticize code
00:14 +yitz_: I hack these things when I'm otherwise bored ... or when the need for a fix gets too important
00:15 +yitz_: Professional critic
00:15 +yitz_: Maybe tonight I'll see about magicking the sort functions into something selectable
00:15 +billnye: I tend to be armchair usability consultant and sounding board ;D
00:15 +yitz_: I still want to first figure out what I want to do with last_spoke
00:16 +billnye: yitz_: does +/-keyname sound like a reasonable format for the list?
00:16 +yitz_: Yeah
00:16 +yitz_: As good as any
00:16 +billnye: yitz_: actlist_sort doesn't have up/down sorting, so that part's kind of our road to pave
00:16 +yitz_: Should be simple to pull off :P
00:16 +billnye: yeah, I'm just asking about the syntax user-side
00:17 +yitz_: Still
00:17 +dngor: +/-keyname works for me, too.
00:17 * yitz_ makes note to see actlist_sort
00:17 +yitz_: I had just rearranged my windows last night (reorder.pl) and was chatting in #40 and it was annoying how /ack put #40 waaaay at the end when I was chatting there... so I had to hack in the last_spoke
00:18 +yitz_: Though I did steal ferret's (?) meta-00 through 39 today :)
00:19 +billnye: the modified dispatch.pl is good enough for me
00:19 +billnye: with as few channels as I have
00:19 +shabble: /window last and go.pl are all I use
00:19 +ferret: only to 39?
00:19 +dngor: The +/- could be translated into a comparator prefix or suffix, like cmp_datalevel_asc() and ..._dsc().  Or it can be converted to a magnitude (1 or -1 respectively) to multiply against the corresponding comparison.  $magnitude[$i] * $comparator[$i]->($a, $b)
00:19 +yitz_: I had channels numbered to 54 today... but only did to 39
00:19 +yitz_: dngor: I was thinking *1 *0 or *-1
00:19 +ferret: I can't think of a good reason to not go up to 99 :P
00:19 +yitz_: For +, - and not used?
00:19 +ferret: or 100 even
00:20 +shabble: yitz_: just write something that adds the shortcuts when you create a new window :)
00:20 +dngor: yitz_: Just omit for not-used.
00:20 +yitz_: Heh. I just did it in vim in the config
00:20 +shabble: tsk tsk ;p
00:20 +yitz_: And I stopped at 40 :P
00:20 +billnye: I do like meta-2digit better than clobbering the other keybindings
00:20 +yitz_: vim's the only good way to manipulate the config....
00:20 +shabble: also, use vim_mode and :b :D
00:20 +yitz_: Who?
00:21 +ferret: yitz_: I did it with a bash for loop
00:21 +billnye: AnybodyWho'sListening, I presume
00:21 +yitz_: Mah.... I should have
00:21 +billnye: can't begrudge a fellow a little shameless self promotion
00:21 * yitz_ notes down all the scripts to check out. actlist_sort dispatch.pl go.pl vim_mode
00:22 +billnye: (actlist_sort being a setting)
00:22 +yitz_: billnye: Is the modified dispatch publicly available? Is it shabble's?
00:22 +yitz_: lol
00:22 +yitz_: Oooh. OK
00:22 +shabble: not mine
00:22 +billnye: http://billnye.blinkenshell.org/irssi/dispatch-plus-windows.txt
00:22 +shabble: yitz_: http://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/tree/master/vim-mode, still fairly alpha though
00:23 +billnye: dunno whether the topcredit is accurate or not
00:23 +billnye: haven't compared to "stock" dispatch.pl
00:24 +yitz_: Hm. Thinking last_spoke should be 5 minutes and last 5-10 channels. Maybe 10% of all your channels? I'm probably gonna implement 5 min and 5 channels tonight. And then try doing the sort-function-setting
00:25 +billnye: sounds fine to start from... let me know when you push, and I'll check it out
00:25 +billnye: heading home now, I double-swear
00:25 +billnye: *poof*
00:25 * yitz_ *poofs* 15 min ago
00:26 +yitz_: Yeah. git. I can manage that...
00:26 * yitz_ scrambles to find his notes

06:12 +happyface: are the auto logs created when irssi is quit
06:12 +yitz_: What the heck? I just cloned on all my networks...
06:12 +yitz_: happyface: No. If you want logs, make them before quitting
06:13 +happyface: yitz_: how do I do that?
06:13 +yitz_: /set autolog
06:14 +yitz_: And /lastlog to capture existing buffers
06:14 +happyface: autolog is on
06:14 +happyface: but it seems the last log was created on oct 8th, even though I'm on every day
06:14 +yitz_: Then you ought to have logs
06:14 +yitz_: Check the path?
06:15 +yitz_: See the settings: autolog_ignore_targets autolog_level autolog_path
06:15 +happyface: well this is confusing
06:16 +happyface: why is there a huge file with every channel in the network, then individual files for each channel
06:16 +yitz_: You're doing something wrong? A rawlog?
06:17 +happyface: ï€ª.log
06:17 +yitz_: Maybe /rawlog close
06:17 +happyface: just in freenode, though
06:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
06:18 +happyface: yea, freenode seems to be the only messed up log folder
06:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
06:21 +happyface: anyone know why all my Freenode autologs are in *.log instead of individual channel files?
06:24 +Dirm: guessing you're running 0.8.12
06:24 +Dirm: yep :)
06:24 +happyface: cygwin version, unfortunately
06:24 +happyface: linux box is down atm
06:24 +Dirm: yeah known bug in .12
06:25 +happyface: argh
06:25 +happyface: are there .15 compiled binaries somewhere?
06:26 +Dirm: happyface: http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=533&project=5&order=id&sort=asc&pagenum=14&toggleadvanced=1
06:26 +Dirm: has a workaround
06:26 +happyface: thanks a lot Dirm
06:28 * happyface adds wait command to networks
06:32 +happyface: I could probably bypass this problem using server password authentication couldn't I?
06:38 +bburhans: happyface: server passwords certainly make it less likely. They're usually significantly faster.
06:38 +bburhans: happyface: on freenode you can also use SASL which doesn't join until authenticated (identified)
06:42 +happyface: bburhans: I'll set that up tomorrow, thanks. Do a lot of networks support SASL?
06:43 +tmr: happyface, also, Cygwin has 0.8.15.
06:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vrt2]
07:08 +bburhans: happyface: no, although some others offer SSL certificate auth instead, which is comparable.

12:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Tim_Smart]
12:07 +Tim_Smart: Ello. What are dependencies for building from SVN?
12:08 +vague`: Tim_Smart, why do you need to build from svn? Is there some functionality you are missing in 0.8.15?
12:09 +Tim_Smart: vague`: In case I wanted to hack on the code.
12:10 +zidoh: jink: did not know about that one, thanks :)
12:10 +jink: zidoh: np.
12:10 +vague`: Says 'GLIB (at least version 2.0) is required to compile Irssi' on the website. Any others are optional I reckon.
12:11 +Tim_Smart: vague`: Yeah I got all those, but it seems they use autoconf and friends, which are failing.
12:11 +iaj: i'm using nickcolor.pl - however can I somehow extend it to use more colors ;)?
12:11 +jink: Rape the source? :)
12:12 +zidoh: jink: you wouldn't happen to know what could cause irssi to fail to open new log files with the error "no such file or directory" at seemingly files then?
12:12 +jink: zidoh accidentally "random".
12:12 +jink: No, I haven't a clue.  My logging seems to work fine. :)
12:14 +zidoh: meh, should probably just reinstall the whole server anyways
12:15 +Steve57: Tim_Smart: how is autoconf failing?
12:15 +zidoh: too many things are broken, and the filesystem especially seems to be drunk
12:15 +jink: :D
12:15 +Tim_Smart: Steve57: I'll show you ;)
12:15 +jink: zidoh: df -i ?
12:16 +Tim_Smart: Steve57: Do I need to run pkg-config or something first?
12:16 +Steve57: Tim_Smart: just ./autogen.sh

16:50 +billnye: mAniAk-_-: there may be a more elegant way than this even, but...
16:50 +billnye: mAniAk-_-: then you'll probably want something like /bind ^[[1~ key fleft

17:50 +mAniAk-_-: irssi is the only place i use alt+left
17:51 +Bazerka: happyface: cap_sals.pl requires various cpan packages, so unless you're using the full cygwin environment, you've got a world of hurt ahead of you trying to get it to work
17:51 +Bazerka: the windows installer only has a limited set of cpan modules and no easy means of adding new ones
17:52 +happyface: Bazerka: so I'll need packages not included in the windows installer?
17:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v MichealH]
17:53 +Bazerka: the windows installer only contains a very limited set of software (ie, irssi, the perl dlls and the core perl modules)
17:53 +Bazerka: (and a few odds and ends)
17:53 +happyface: Bazerka: sorry, I meant the cygwin installer, where you can select packages
17:54 +Bazerka: do you have a full cygwin environment, or have you used the irssi windows installer?
17:54 +tmr: After testing go provides completion on partial matches, so ssi<tab> for me completes to #irssi.
17:54 +happyface: Bazerka: full cygwin
17:54 +Bazerka: |14 Oct 16:39:53| <+Bazerka> go will tab complete without the #

17:54 +Bazerka: |14 Oct 16:40:04| <+Bazerka> so you can /go irs<tab>
17:54 +Bazerka: happyface: oh, that's a totally different story :)
17:54 +happyface: sweet!
17:55 +Bazerka: use run perl -MCPAN -e shell

17:57 +Bazerka: hmm
17:58 +Bazerka: I don't see cap_sasl.pl having a dep on that module
17:58 +Death4Li1e: I know that the stand alone perl install has a perl packet manager ( ppm ) on windows

18:14 +Pluggi-512: Hi
18:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v happyface]
18:14 +Bazerka: happyface: in fact, looking at that script, you're going to need to install a few modules from CPAN ( Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum , Crypt::DH , Crypt::Blowfish )
18:15 +happyface: Bazerka: gcc is throwing tons of errors making the Bignum module http://paste2.org/p/1036967
18:16 +Bazerka: you'll need to install the perl-dev package (or its equivalent) and possibly the openssl-dev package
18:16 +Bazerka: (or its equivalent)
18:16 +happyface: alright
18:16 +Bazerka: basically, you need the perl and openssl headers
18:17 +Bazerka: I suspect you may already have the perl headers
18:17 +happyface: yea, I have openssl-devel
18:17 +happyface: can't find perl-dev
18:18 +Bazerka: if you have openssl-devel installed, it shouldn't have complained about :
18:18 +Bazerka: #
18:18 +Bazerka: Bignum.xs:5:25: error: openssl/ssl.h: No such file or directory
18:18 +Bazerka: #
18:18 +Bazerka: Bignum.xs:6:24: error: openssl/bn.h: No such file or directory
18:18 +Bazerka: hmm
18:19 +Bazerka: I also notice references to perl 5.10 there, but in your irssi script paste earlier, your INC only contained references to perl 5.8
18:20 +Bazerka: can you pastebin the output of perl -v
18:20 +Bazerka: perl -V even
18:22 +happyface: v5.10.1
18:22 +happyface: big V:
18:22 +happyface: http://paste2.org/p/1036995
18:22 +Bazerka: so you have perl 5.10 installed, but your irssi is using a perl 5.8 .so
18:23 +Bazerka: what's the output of ldd /path/to/irssi_binary/irssi
18:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SS3]
18:23 +Bazerka: and whilst we're at it, did you use a package or self-build irssi?
18:24 +Bazerka: istr, cygwin has an irssi 0.8.15 package these days, although I don't know which version of perl it is built against
18:25 +happyface: I can't remember which irssi I used
