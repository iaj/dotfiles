00:00 +dn4: how do I change my ircname in irssi ? using mac os x
00:00 +dn4: if someone does a who is on me it shows up with my roommates real name :(
00:00 +dn4: instead of mine
00:01 +Death4Life: dn4: /set real_name I think
00:01 +yitz_: set name
00:01 +Death4Life: or /set user_name
00:01 +yitz_: /set name
00:02 +lestat: dn4: also you need to restart your client in order for the change to take effect iirc
00:02 +Death4Life: disconnect / connect works too I think
00:02 +lestat: yes
00:03 +Death4Life: but no /reconnect I think
00:03 +dn4: ok thank you
00:03 +dn4: trying all three
00:04  w3rdn4: ok back
00:04 --- w3rdn4 is now known as dn4

00:04 +dn4:  using /set real_name beer
00:04 +dn4: that worked
00:05 +dn4: what is the hostname when I do /whois ?
00:05 +dn4: also in mac os x how do I change channels?
00:05 +xand: your OS has little to do with how you use irssi
00:06 +dn4: how do I change channels ?
00:06 +xand: go read the startup guid

00:51 +iaj: webvictim: do you have any growl notification or something set up?
00:51 +webvictim: yeah
00:51 +webvictim: funnily, it just pinged at me :P
00:52 +webvictim: there's a script called growl-notify.pl i think
00:52 +webvictim: the thing is that it's designed to connect to a local growl server, primarily
00:53 +webvictim: so to get it working over SSH i have to port forward
00:53 +webvictim: and then run a couple of python scripts to tunnel it over TCP
00:53 +webvictim: one on the server, one on my local machine
00:53 +webvictim: it works well though
00:53 +iaj: hmmm alright I searched the scripts site but couldn't find a growl script there
00:53 +iaj: where may I get it?
00:53 +iaj: im local anyway :d

01:58 +Dirm: jayne: you can use Data::Dumper or search perl.txt for query->
01:58 +Dirm: to discover where to look
01:58 +jayne: I have done both, and not found anything
01:58 +jayne: there's name and visible_name, but neither correspond to the query target

02:16 +jayne: okay, new problem. When I $server->command('WHOIS :'.$nick); the client displays the 311 and 312, but somehow the 313 gets lost. It doesn't even show up in rawlog.
02:16 +jayne: ideas why / how to fix?
02:17 +Bazerka: if it doesn't show in the rawlog, the server isn't sending it
02:18 +Bazerka: are you sure the person you're whois'ing is opered?
02:18 +jayne: it shows up when I /whois manually
02:18 +jayne: (I'm whois-ing nickserv, if you want to try it)
02:18 +Bazerka: why are you prepending the nick with : btw?
02:21 +jayne: because that's what irssi does when I /whois and look at rawlog?
02:22 +Bazerka: right, but ->command() issues an irssi command in the $server context - ie, it's the same as typing /command in the relevant window
02:22 +Bazerka: so you don't need to worry about :
02:22 +jayne: 671 isn't redirecting to the correct window, either
02:24 +jayne: it redirects correctly when not called from script
02:25 +Bazerka: 671 is the using secure connection numeric?
02:25 +jayne: yeah
02:26 +Bazerka: working fine here
02:26 +Bazerka:  /script exec Irssi::active_win()->{active}->command('whois bazerka');
02:26 +bburhans: you don't need the ->{active}
02:26 +bburhans: but yeah
02:26 +bburhans: ditto, works fine for me
02:26 +Bazerka: and I see every line I expect to see
02:27 +bburhans: oh, I lied, I used active_server()
02:27 +Bazerka: active_win()->{active} probably == active_server() :)
02:27 +bburhans: one would assume so :P
02:27 +bburhans: although Window->command works fine too, no?
02:27 +bburhans: I've never seen the ->{active} before
02:28 +Dirm: wouldn't ->{active} be the active item within the window?
02:28 +Bazerka: a window can contain witems in different servers
02:29 +bburhans: Bazerka: right, but by default running a command in the context of Window will run it in the active server context, no?
02:29 +Dirm: right
02:29 +Bazerka: sure, I'm just pedantic tho :)
02:29 +jayne: there's a Window::active_server, too
02:29 +Bazerka: but anyways, we digress
02:30 +Dirm: but active_win()->command might run it in an item other than the active one?
02:30 +Dirm: oh that's what you meant by ==
02:30 +jayne: the /script thing redirects correctly... so why doesn't my script :-/
02:30 +Bazerka: jayne: pastebin your script
02:30 +Dirm: not == but substitutable for, in this case
02:30 +Dirm: pfft, some pedant :)
02:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
02:31 +Bazerka: Dirm: it's late, I'm tired and I'm hungry - recipe for grumpiness :)
02:31 +jayne: Bazerka: so far, just http://www.pastey.net/141939
02:32 +Bazerka: Dirm: so my pedantry is being held in check
02:33 +Bazerka: I must say, that's one of the worst pastebins I've seen
02:33 +Bazerka: especially for small amounts of pasted text :(
02:33 +Bazerka: too much clutter around the actual paste
02:33 * jayne shrugs
02:34 +jayne: it has better syntax highlighting than anything else
02:34 +jayne: although for just Perl code, almost anything would work
02:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nightfrog]
02:35 +Bazerka: you're writing a auto-whois-on-query script?
02:35 +shabble: haha, Perl probably being the winner of 'thing hardest to parse properly, ever'
02:36 +jayne: Bazerka: I'm starting with that
02:36 +Bazerka: you realise you're reinventing the wheel? :)
02:37 +jayne: I have to recreate the spokes other people have already created before I can get to the wheel I ultimately want
02:37 +shabble: out of curiousity, why are you poking around with caller()?
02:37 +jayne: shabble: just left-overs... I use it when throwing errors
02:37 +shabble: ah, ok. You could just use Carp, of course ;)

11:11 +tmr: swoody, though you don't need to forward anything normally. Do you mean dcc port?
11:12 +swoody: no sorry, what I'm actually trying to do is create a QOS rule so my IRC traffic has higher priority and stops dc'ing me :)
11:13 +Koffa: o,O
11:13 +tmr: Then the first answer will list used ports.
11:14 +swoody: so since I connect to port 7000 on freenode's server, that's the port I need to specifiy in my router?
11:14 +xintron: using /connect -network <address> will allow me to use the network to autojoin channels etc but on another server than the one specified in the server-config right?

12:52 +xintron: ds187: but then again, it can become so much more than just a browser :)
12:52 +tmr: bremner, sshfs or reading thgough ssh conn, yes.

12:55 +ds187: could it be perhaps done like in the amarok_ssh script? there the script opens up another ssh session, from the server to the desktop, to control amarok via dcop
12:56 +ds187: that should somehow work i think
12:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
12:57 +tmr: ds187, if you can open connection from server to desktop, you could just use firefox remote commands.
12:58 +tmr: err.. Spawn another uzbl.

16:21 +bremner: hmm. browser debugging output is annoying with url.pl. I wonder what the simplest fix is.
16:23 +grawity: bremner: mkdir ~/bin; printf '#!/bin/sh\nexec "${BROWSER:-firefox}" "$@" 2>/dev/null\n' > ~/bin/browser; # reconfigure url.pl to call 'browser'
16:24 +xand: isn't it rare to run irssi on the machine you're actually typing on?
16:25 +Remco: I do
16:25 +Remco: And I also ssh in
16:25 +Steve57: why would you run it anywhere else?
16:26 +Steve57: i was wondering that earlier.
16:26 +Remco: Desktops are usually turned off for long periods of time. Servers should keep running
16:26 +Remco: So you can be on IRC 24/7
16:26 +bremner: xand: I run znc on a server, and connect to that
16:26 +zmx: And, you can acces the same irssi from all the web
16:26 +xand: s/web/net/
16:27 +xand: Steve57: because i turn my desktops/laptops off etc
16:27 +zmx: :$
16:27 +Steve57: hmm... could be. though this one's never off.
16:27 +xand: web is http :p
16:27 +zmx: I can acces irssi over http \o/
16:27 +Steve57: :))
16:27 +xand: :S
16:29 +Steve57: thinking about it, i'd go crazy if i had to take this thing down every day.

16:31 +ds187: "turn off" even :-)
16:31 +zeknox: hey fellas, I'm trying to make IRSSI less chatty, as stated in this tutorial http://www.irssi.org/documentation/tips , I place the commands in the windows but I still get notifications of people loging in and out, any ideas?
16:31 +xand: what is IRSSI?
16:31 +ds187: IRSSI is irssi on CAPSLOCKDAY

16:32 +zeknox: does it matter which window I place the alias commands into?
16:33 +Rhonda: zeknox: You might want to take a look at /help levels and /help ignore
16:33 +zeknox: Rhonda: thanks I will look into that
16:33 +kavakava: I started to log a channel using /log open -targets #Channel ~/file, but I have no idea how to stop the logging. Anyone?
16:34 +Rhonda: And scroll that tips page down to "my anti annoyance filters"
16:34 +grawity: kavakava: /log close
16:34 +kavakava: grawity: Log file  not open
16:35 +Bazerka: you have to specify the filename or logid
16:35 +kavakava: I specified the filename, but still the same message.
16:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tyebud]
16:36 +Steve57: how about the log id?
16:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v IboS]
16:36 +Bazerka: um
16:36 +Steve57:  /log will show all open logs
16:36 +Bazerka: if you got the same message, you didn't specify the filename
16:37 +kavakava: Steve57: That worked. Great!
16:37 +Bazerka: "Log file  not open" <- that additional space is due to no filename being passed
16:37 +Steve57: kavakava, good :)
16:37 +kavakava: Bazerka: I did specify it, just didn't bother to paste the new message. Sorry. :-P
16:37 +Steve57: and i missed that, Bazerka
16:38 +Bazerka: kavakava: did you specify just the filename or the FULL filename including path?
16:38 +kavakava: Also, I tabbed to be sure it was the correct file.
16:38 +Bazerka: it has to match the full filename shown in /log
16:38 +kavakava: I used ~/filename.
16:38 +Bazerka: and what was the actual response you got?
16:39 +kavakava: Log file ~/motereferat-2010-10-22 not open
16:39 +kavakava: Could it be that I opened it with %Y-...?
16:40 +Bazerka: so, that's not the same filename as listed by /log , is it? :)
16:41 +kavakava: You could say that. :-P
16:41 +kavakava: Closing it with %Y-... worked.
16:41 +kavakava: So ... Conclusion: I suck.
16:41 +Bazerka: nah
16:42 +Bazerka: you learnt something new, so it's all good :)
16:42 +kavakava: I guess so. Anyway, thanks!

17:38 +sprink: Does irssi have the ability to "detach" from a channel, or, hide a window?
17:39 +Bazerka: no, but you could add the window to your activity_hide_targets
17:41 +sprink: Yeah I discovered that feature. Worked great for a while
17:41 +sprink: Now I have so many channels I was hoping to completely hide some of them
17:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ampzqlox]
17:41 +sprink: so I could use their window number for other channels
