14:13 +excelsior: can someone tell me how to end a conversation when I'm done with /msg? I'm not getting a new hidden window for every new conversation or channel i join, it's all in one window
14:14 +Ticho: /query
14:15 +Ticho: or set autoclose_query to number of seconds you wish the conversations to end after you've seen all messages in it

14:42 +otak: Hi sometimes a set key is not boolean. How do I show the optional values?
14:44 +Rhonda: with /set foo
14:45 +otak: That shows me what it is set to now. How do I see what the other values are?
14:45 +zmx: hmmm ? /set autolog_level ?
14:45 +Rhonda: What do you mean with other values?
14:45 +zmx: Here I only see the current value
14:45 +zmx: "What can I put in the 'autolog_level' settings"
14:46 +billnye: zmx: /help levels
14:46 +Rhonda: ah
14:46 +Rhonda: yes, /help levels
14:46 +zmx: (replace autolog_level with ALL non boolean settings)
14:46 +Rhonda: zmx: but that was your question, not otak's :)
14:47 +zmx: And AFAIK they are no general way for helping with this.
14:47 +Rhonda: There can't be a general answer to that. Just name the option you don't know what to put in and we might be able to give you a more helpful answer.
14:47 +zmx: They are no "/help set autolog_level" for each options
14:47 +Rhonda: That's right.
14:48 +billnye: irssi is at least pretty sensible about its names
14:48 +billnye: if it says "targets" it expects targets, "levels" levels, etc.
14:49 +otak: thanks well I'll just read /help levels for a mo
14:49 +vague`: otak, for some settings you need to read the source, like /set actlist_sort
14:49 +zmx: Yes, you can know with the name what a settings want (autoclose_query??) but they are no sample or help for explaining what it did with the "targets"
14:50 +billnye: hyperair: 4 ChanServ!ChanServ@services. #irssi: MODES -network FreeNode
14:50 +hyperair: billnye: what?
14:50 +billnye: zmx: correct, but once you know what a target is, it applies across the board
14:50 +billnye: hyperair: excerpted from my /ignore output
14:51 +billnye: I only ended up with 2 +vs
14:51 +hyperair: billnye: huh?
14:51 +hyperair: i don't understand what you're trying to tell me
14:51 +otak: So can I set irssi to ignore channel joins/leaves?
14:52 +billnye: <+hyperair> it's not quiet with all those +vs around   hyperair * levelclears it
14:52 +billnye: otak: sure
14:52 +billnye: otak: /help ignore, along with your newfound LEVELS
14:52 +otak: ok
14:52 +billnye: otak: there's also more than one way to do it

14:53 +hyperair: billnye: well yes i said that. but i still don't get what that output you pasted for me means?
14:53 +billnye: otak: ranging from just keeping them out of the [Act: ] bar, to retroactively stripping them from the window on command, to redirecting them to another window, to outright ignoring
14:53 +billnye: hyperair: that's the output from /ignore
14:54 +hyperair: oh!
14:54 +billnye: "you can ignore just modes, just from chanserv, just in #irssi if you want." in plain english
14:56 +hyperair: billnye: i see!
14:56 +hyperair: thanks
14:56 +billnye: np :)

16:07 +billnye: wwalker: are they logged via autolog?
16:08 +r4_: hrm im going to have to read more about levels...things are all messed up...going to turn it off!
16:08 +billnye: wwalker: (and I think autolog_colors might be mIRC colors, not theme colors)
