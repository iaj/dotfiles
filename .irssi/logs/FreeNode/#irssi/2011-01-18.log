00:27 +nightfrog: Im changing nicks to realnames in this script and message own_public is being a pain

00:29 +nightfrog: shabble: $server->{nick} but I forget if that changes with /nick
00:29 +billnye: color WHAT messages?

00:29 +billnye: color WHAT messages?
00:29 +nightfrog: shabble: I never tried with an expando
00:30 +billnye: :)
00:30 +billnye: irssi messages or IRC messages?
00:30 +GrooveDog: IRC messages.
00:30 +GrooveDog: Or "message sent"/
00:30 +nightfrog: Isn't there a generic event for messages?
00:31 +billnye: you need MIRC colors not irssi formats for stuff you send
00:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v gusto]
00:31 +GrooveDog: I tried that.
00:31 +billnye: that's what will eventually succeed :)
00:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dunpeal]
00:31 +GrooveDog: Well, "tried"
00:32 +GrooveDog: What do I use in place of the control-c?
00:32 +dunpeal: Hey. Why does irssi list the users in each channel I /join?
00:32 +billnye: dunpeal: because it's set to Show Names On Join
00:33 +billnye: hint: /set will do keyword searching on setting names
00:33 +billnye: hint2: setting names are darn sensible in irssi
00:34 +billnye: you might not guess "show", or "names" on the first try, but you had "join" without needing to try another variation
00:34 +billnye: and even "show" might only be as far as three tries away from list->display->show
00:35 +billnye: GrooveDog: \x03 for control c perhaps?
00:35 +GrooveDog: Sigh
00:35 +GrooveDog: Thanks.
00:36 +nightfrog: shabble: I need to remove the nick from message own_public and continue the signal with the replacement and unless it is in @_ I don't see how to change it
00:37 +shabble: nightfrog: I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do
00:37 +dunpeal: billnye: thanks, but given that "join" is the one I was sure of, how could I get the autocompletion to work?
00:37 +shabble: can you explain it from the top?
00:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v uzsolt]
00:38 +billnye: dunpeal: /set join
00:38 +billnye: dunpeal: scan the output for anything relevant
00:38 +dunpeal: billnye: unfortunately, it immediately completes to:
00:38 +billnye: nightfrog: this isn't for bitlbee izzit?
00:39 +billnye: dunpeal: no, just /set join
00:39 +dunpeal:  /set join_auto_chans_on_invite
00:39 +nightfrog: /who the channel on 'window changed' and save all the nicks and realnames. Then on messages of all likes replace the nicks you see in Irssi with realnames
00:39 +nightfrog: billnye: nah
00:39 +dunpeal: billnye: ah, kewl, thanks a whole bunch :)
00:39 +nightfrog: Something like it
00:39 +billnye: dunpeal: good guess, but tabcomplete assumes you meant what you typed
00:40 +billnye: (i.e. it's tabCOMPLETE not tabSEARCH  :D )
00:41 +billnye: dunpeal: but yeah, that principle of picking a sensible substring for the option you're looking for is one that will serve you well
00:41 +GrooveDog: billnye: How would I do the control-_ then?
00:41 +billnye: sometimes it takes a few tries, but the more you learn irssi's "lingo" the easier it gets
00:42 +billnye: GrooveDog: if I'm right, \x03 IS control c, not just c
00:42 +nightfrog: shabble make sense? script I started years ago and put on the back burner and did one for xchat and now getting back to the one for irssi
00:42 +culb: [01/17/11 @ 18:43:00] [  John M ] GrooveDog: if I'm right, \x03 IS control c, not just c

00:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peleg]
00:44 +shabble: nightfrog: hmm, I think you might not need to do the querying with /who yourself, the nick objects from the channel should be store the real_name, no?
00:45 +dunpeal: billnye: yeah, irssi turned out to have the most gentle learning curve
00:45 +billnye: much more than it would seem at first glance, definitely
00:45 +nightfrog: shabble: I didnt think so..

01:35 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 100 seconds

02:10 +nightfrog: I use what you had and $serv_realname = substr( $serv_realname, index( $realname,' ' ) +1 ); for realnames with spaces
02:11 +Bazerka: in my application, realnames weren't a piece of data I was interested in, so I left the prefix there
02:11 +nightfrog: I see
02:11 +Bazerka: I was doing it to collect usernames and hosts
02:12 +Bazerka: and status
02:12 +Bazerka: (basically, to collate a list of opers in the channel)
02:14 +Bazerka: so it's all working now?
02:15 +Bazerka: and yeah, as you've noticed, the 352 response can be formatted differently depending on ircd :)
02:15 +nightfrog: yeah

02:53 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 97 seconds
02:53 +stiv2k: i have a problem, i have my irssi client set to auto join the #fedora channel, but it redirects me to #fedora-unregistered, because it tries to join the channel right before the autosendcmd bit sends the identify command for nickserv
02:53 +stiv2k: how can i fix this?
02:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
02:55 +Dirm: add a wait after the autosendcmd
02:56 +Dirm: er, at the end of the autosendcmd
02:56 +stiv2k: Dirm: no
02:57 +stiv2k: Dirm: the autosendcmd is happening too late
02:57 +stiv2k: because it tries to join the channel before it identifies
02:57 +Dirm: no, the join is happening too soon
02:57 +Dirm: if you add a wait, it wno't
02:57 +cromag_: stiv2k: Dirm is correct.
02:57 +Dirm: this is a pretty standard thing
02:57 +Dirm: the startup-howto has a wait in the autosendcmd specifically for this reason
02:57 +stiv2k: Dirm: im not joining channels with autosendcmd though
02:57 +Dirm: right
02:57 +cromag_: because it joins to fast :)
02:58 +Dirm: so irssi connects, runs autosendcmd, sends join commands
02:58 +cromag_: try it with the wait 2000;
02:58 +Dirm: but it sends the join commands before freenode has processed the identify
02:58 +stiv2k: ok
02:58 +stiv2k: i already have wait in there
02:58 +Dirm: how long?
02:59 +stiv2k: autosendcmd = "/^msg nickserv identify password;wait 2000";
02:59 +stiv2k: thats how i have it already
03:00 +stiv2k: just increase to 3000 maybe?
03:00 +Dirm: maybe
03:00 +Dirm: freenode also has an alternative means of identify
03:00 +Dirm: ing
03:00 +Dirm: you can specify nick/pass as the server pass
03:01 +Dirm: and then timing issues are impossible
03:01 +cromag_: i have 2000ms in the wait, and that is enough for me.

19:32 +MystKid: i ahve the fear2.theme installed tho
19:34 +Koffa: so find a theme you like?
19:35 +Koffa: I've made my own
19:35 +MystKid: the only think id liek is to change other people's nick color
19:35 +MystKid: was wondering if there is a command to do so
19:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v atxq]
19:36 +Koffa: probably   $EDITOR .irssi/fear2.theme  ?
19:36 --- Guest47510 is now known as RaNdY
19:37 +atxq: hey guys, so what are public and actions exactly?
19:37 +Koffa: atxq: this is public
19:37 --- RaNdY is now known as Guest28291
19:37 * Koffa is in action
19:37 +atxq: and actions?
19:37 +MystKid: Koffa:  and what do i have to change in that file XD
19:37 +Koffa: MystKid: probably channick =
19:37 +Koffa: I have "%c$0-%n";
19:37 +Koffa: making it cyanish
19:38 +atxq: I want to ignore all messages, even when users change their nick
19:38 +Koffa: you probably have %g if it's green... what would you prefer?
19:39 +MystKid: like you do
19:39 +MystKid: progbably
19:39 +MystKid: ill try now
19:39 +MystKid: to restart irssi and see
19:39 +atxq: IGNORE -regexp -pattern "is (away|gone|back)" * ACTIONS
19:39 +ZnHxr: MystKid: just /reload
19:39 +atxq: how can I write this without using regexp?
19:39 +Koffa: yeah, no need to restart
19:39 +MystKid: that didnt really change the color of ur nicks
19:39 +MystKid: lols
19:39 +Koffa: atxq: you'd need several lines
19:39 +Koffa: MystKid: what did you change it to?
19:40 +MystKid: what u got
19:40 +Koffa: the %colorcodes are listed in /usr/share/doc/irssi/formats.txt
19:40 +atxq: so this is the best way to write it?
19:40 +MystKid: the same you have
19:40 +Koffa: MystKid: not familiar with the theme, maybe it has some twists
19:41 +Koffa: atxq: it covers 3 cases in one line so it's quite good
19:41 +atxq: well, that line does not include joins
19:41 +Koffa: of course not
19:41 +atxq: I added joined to the list, but did not work
19:41 +MystKid: ill restart
19:41 +Koffa: /ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS MODES NICKS
19:41 +Koffa: I have that
19:41 +atxq: that line is what I had in mind, just was not sure if it would work
19:41 +Koffa: it ignores those 5 levels on all channels
19:42 +Koffa: it's in /help ignore, more or less
19:42 +jink: And in /help levels
19:42 +atxq: I see help, just the examples they have their exclude joins from the rest
19:43 +Koffa: you can have several levels there, as I showed
19:44 +atxq: thanks Koffa, for the help
19:44 +Koffa: np
19:44 +atxq: I need to restart irssi for it to take effect?
19:45 +jink: No.  Restarting is for Windows.
19:45 +jink: You might want to /save though.  In case you ever do restart irssi.
19:45 +ZnHxr: I thought /quit automatically /saves
19:46 +jink: Maybe if you set the option for that.
19:46 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v filePeter]
19:46 +atxq: awesome stuff guys
19:47 +Koffa: if quit automatically /saved, you'd have to kill irssi by some /exec killall irssi   to make sure no unwanted configuration was saved :)
19:47 +ZnHxr: settings_autosave = ON
19:48 +Koffa: does it affect /quit ?
19:48 +Koffa: or just periodic autosave
19:48 +jink: I think that's periodic.
19:48 +jink: Not sure, though.
19:49 +jink: I usually just /save :)
19:51 +tmr: killall irssi should save config just like /quit.
19:51 +Koffa: killall -9 irssi ?
19:51 +Koffa: ffs
19:51 +ZnHxr: why do people use numbers with kill?
19:51 +Koffa: what else is there?
19:52 +Koffa: tmr: killall irssi doesn't save
19:52 +tmr: Well, if you use -9 you'll mess things up, sure.
19:52 +Koffa: /quit does, which was news for me
19:52 +tmr: Hmm..
19:52 +ZnHxr: Koffa: names
19:52 +Koffa: ZnHxr: are they 1 char?
19:53 +ZnHxr: no, but they work across different systems
19:53 +Koffa: I know the system(s) I'm on :)
19:53 +Koffa: kill is 4 chars o,O
19:53 +Koffa: trying to kill a process, not write a novel
19:54 +ZnHxr: killall -3 irssi  # now what?
19:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v chrislerum]
19:55 +tmr: Koffa, yeah it doesn't save, but I still think it should.
19:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v loadedwithcoffee]
19:57 +Koffa: does irssi do any backups like config- ?
19:58 +Koffa: so that you don't accidentally wipe your working config with some testing
19:58 +tmr: It does if you use autosave.
19:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
19:59 +tmr: Or at least I think that's why I have config.autosave
20:00 +Koffa: I like the idea of periodic autosave in case you just forget to /save, but saving on /quit is somewhat frightening
20:00 +Koffa: but of course irssi-users don't do mistakes so it's not an issue ;)

20:20 +billnye: tmr: the mtime on my config.autosave is pretty darn old to be "last autosave"
20:23 +tmr: Hrmm, true.. Where the hell did that come from..
20:24 +billnye: tmr: maybe some part of the /save and already-modified save file interaction?
20:25 +tmr: Ah changelog "r762 | cras | 2000-10-15 19:21:21  Irssi won't automatically overwrite configuration files if they're  - /SAVE asks whether to save it or not  - autosave at quit saves it to config.autosave file"
20:26 +tmr: *if they're changed while irssi is running:
20:27 +billnye: I was close :)
20:27 +billnye: and your initial guess was close too
20:28 +tmr: I guess..

22:29 +Bazerka: a rawlog of the line would be interesting

22:29 +Nei: save the raw log
22:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CrazyEddy]
22:30 +twiggy: suom1: aha! dot. be wary tho. irssi crashes because of it unless you remove something about cumode in the files
22:30 +Bazerka: twiggy: not for long
22:30 +Bazerka: I'll be committing a fix for that soon(tm)
22:30 +twiggy: how do i save the raw log?
22:31 +twiggy: great, but what does cumode do? i've noticed anything odd or missing when i removed it
22:31 +suom1: Bazerka, commit now!!!!
22:31 +suom1: :D
22:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zed`]
22:32 +Bazerka: suom1: no, because I want to ensure the patch is teh right way to do it and not just a quick fix, so I'm having to work back through code I've not come across yet
22:32 +suom1: quickfixes <3
22:32 +suom1: :D
22:33 +Bazerka: the expando and theme code makes me o_O
22:33 +twiggy: suom1: just download it from irssi.org or and edit it out. i just had to edit the number one the same line to make it look ok. if you use nickcolor.pl just must have a special version just so you know
22:33 +suom1: I do not use nickcolor :)
22:34 +twiggy: suom1: then go for it. just remove cumode
22:34 +suom1: I will blame Bazerka if my irssi does a booboo!
