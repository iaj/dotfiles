21:18 +initself: no luck
21:18 +initself: if i put a die in your code, will irssi print it?
21:18 +initself: like, before it loads?
21:18 +initself: yitz_: ^
21:18 +yitz_: Probably
21:18 +yitz_: Why would you put a die in it?
21:18 +initself: oh, shit, wget
21:19 +yitz_: What are you doing that's not working?

21:20 +initself: on both parts
21:20 +initself: no luck
21:20 +initself: let me try to run al the commands again
21:21 +initself: i think the dies just made the script fail
21:21 +initself: i wonder where the error goes
21:21 +yitz_: It's reordering for me on script load
21:22 +initself: you dont have DIE in your program
21:22 +initself: hehe
21:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v initself]
21:22 +yitz_: Nope. I use print when I want to print :P

21:36 +Remco: AmIUsingSSLcorre: Windows? Can't help you then
21:36 +AmIUsingSSLcorre: x.x
21:37 +Remco: You can check the options irssi gives in /help connect or /help server but that's as far as I can go
21:37 +Remco: No windows here ;)
21:37 +billnye: AmIUsingSSLcorre: I'm guessing that windows-native SSL certs are going to have nothing to do with cygwin-level certs, and I'm as little help as Remco on that front

22:12 +xand: ofc.
22:12 +dunpeal: is there a key combination for "go one character forward/backward"?
22:13 +dunpeal: I was surprised ^f and ^b don't work, given the other emacs shortcuts are working.
22:13 +Dirm: dunpeal: like left and right arrows?
22:14 +dunpeal: Dirm: yeah, except ^f and ^b would be better.
22:14 +Dirm: see /bind left
22:15 +Dirm: and then bind ^F to the same thing
22:15 +Dirm: (well I don't know which is which for F and B, I'm a vi user :) )
22:15 +Dirm: guess it's probably forward and back
22:16 +xand: why wouldn't you want to use the arrow keys
22:17 +yitz_: initself: ping
22:17 +initself: hi
22:17 +initself: !
22:17 +initself: i've been banned from my favorite channels for re-joining so many times1

22:29 +initself: so it's not working on load
22:29 +initself: startup
22:30 +initself: i tried changing 1 to 0
22:30 +initself: i even tried adding $filename = 'default' below the if
22:30 +initself: i wish i understood how to debug irssi
22:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v GeekyAdam]
22:32 +GeekyAdam: sup all, im new to irssi (3rd day using it and love it already). question: is there any way to highlight keywords automagically? i.e. highlighting my nick when its mentioned
22:33 +Bazerka: GeekyAdam: /help hilight
22:33 +GeekyAdam: ahhh, got it, thx
22:35 +Bazerka: np
22:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SS3]
22:37 +GeekyAdam: the documentations a bit tricky to understand...so if i wanted the whole line highlighted whenever my nick was mentioned, id use "/hilight -line"? or is it "/hilight -line -mask"? or "/hilight -line -mask <text>"?
22:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
22:38 +Dirm: GeekyAdam: you want both -line and -mask
22:38 +Dirm: -line specifies what gets colored, -mask specifies what has to match in order to trigger the hilight
22:39 +Dirm: however, -mask specifies that it's matching the mask of the user who spoke
22:39 +Dirm: so you probably don't want that
22:39 +Dirm: I should read the full line I guess!
22:39 +Dirm: /hilight -line GeekyAdam should suffice
22:40 +GeekyAdam: i tried it can u pls use my nick
22:40 +Dirm: test GeekyAdam test
22:40 +GeekyAdam: working. thx much ^_^
22:41 +Dirm: also, if you haven't, you want to /set hilight_nick_matches off
22:41 +Dirm: GeekyAdam: otherwise this line will have the wrong kind of hilight
22:41 +GeekyAdam: whats that do?
22:41 +GeekyAdam: ahhh
22:41 +Dirm: it creates a sort of default overriding hilight
22:41 +Dirm: that matches lines that start with your nick
22:41 +GeekyAdam: i shee i shee
22:41 +GeekyAdam: gimme another test at beginning of line pls
22:41 +Dirm: GeekyAdam: test
22:41 +GeekyAdam: perfect
22:42 +GeekyAdam: thx Dirm
22:43 +GeekyAdam: another hilight question; i see theres a "-actcolor" option...what exactly does that do? change the activity notification color im guessing?
22:44 +Dirm: yep

23:09 +dunpeal: -!- Irssi: Unknown bind action: left
23:09 +billnye: dunpeal: what action do you want to happen?
23:09 +billnye: the same as your left arrow now, or something else?
23:09 +dunpeal: billnye: same.
23:10 +billnye: dunpeal: "/bind left" to see what left is bound to.
23:11 +dunpeal: cool, it's  "/bind ^F forward_character"
23:11 +dunpeal: and "/bind ^B backward_character"
23:13 +dunpeal: billnye: thanks. any idea how I can bind ^1 to "change_window 1"?
23:13 +billnye: as I mentioned before, control and numbers don't get along very well
23:14 +dunpeal: billnye: what other binding would you recommend, seeing that meta-N is captured by Gnome Terminal (for tab switching)?
23:15 +billnye: change gnome term :)
23:15 +dunpeal: nah, I like it :)
23:16 +dunpeal: +it's the best terminal for Gnome
23:16 +dunpeal: and I'm on Ubuntu so
23:16 +billnye: no, CHANGE gnome term

23:18 +dunpeal: I've been using it for years, irssi is new
23:18 +billnye: do you change irssi windows more often or gnome tabs?
23:19 +billnye: "used to it" is good, you're doing the same thing in either context
23:21 +dunpeal: billnye: probably gnome tabs more often than irssi windows
23:21 +billnye: esc + number won't trip the gnome binding

23:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dunpeal]
23:44 +dunpeal: irssi is so simple
23:44 +shabble: and yet so complicated
23:44 +billnye: simplicated.
23:45 +dunpeal: the only problem is that the main scripting language is perl
23:45 +dunpeal: if I don't run any scripts, does perl run at all?
23:46 +shabble: if you /unload perl, no :)
23:47 +Bazerka: I would say that's its beauty, not its problem :)
23:47 +shabble: that is because you were indoctrinated by a beatiful camel earlier in you life ;)
23:49 +Bazerka: be thankful it wasn't some TCL based abortion!
23:49 +Koffa: there's always inline::python ;)
23:49 +dunpeal: shabble: is there a way not to run it in the first place? :)
23:49 +Koffa: if you're somewhat twisted
23:50 +dunpeal: s/run/load/
23:50 +billnye: dunpeal: just compile it out
23:50 +Koffa: I can't think of using irssi without any scripts
23:50 +Koffa: eg. splitlong.pl still isn't built-in, is it?
23:51 +dunpeal: Koffa: by default, if I installed the vanilla Ubuntu package, am I running any scripts?
23:51 +billnye: dunpeal: check.
23:51 +Koffa: not unless you load them
23:51 +Koffa: but eg. splitlong probably is avail
23:51 +shabble: '/script'
23:52 +shabble: Koffa: I suppose it could put some in autorun?
23:52 +Koffa: is there a global autorun?
23:52 +Koffa: would be kinda kinky
23:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dunpeal]
23:52 +shabble: not sure, actually
23:52 +dunpeal: -!- Irssi: No scripts are loaded
23:52 +shabble: could totally screw with people if there was :)
23:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Dice-Man]
23:52 +dunpeal: but "/unload perl" doesn't barf the first time I run it
23:53 +dunpeal: so perl is loaded, even though there are no scripts.
23:53 +Koffa: perl module
23:53 +Koffa: not perl script
23:53 +Bazerka: if perl wasn't loaded, there'd be no /script command to report no loaded scripts ;)
23:53 +Koffa: /load  shows loaded modules
23:53 +Koffa: which perl is one of and yes, it's loaded by default
23:54 +Bazerka: only if it's compiled in
23:54 +Koffa: well I'm talking about ubuntu, obviously
23:54 +dunpeal: Is there a way to not have it loaded without recompiling it?
23:54 +Bazerka: that wasn't obvious to me :)
23:54 +Bazerka: dunpeal: what's the big problem with having it loadeD?
23:54 +Koffa: he mentioned u
23:55 +dunpeal: Bazerka: seems like a waste to have such a large interpreter running in the background for no reason.
23:55 +Koffa: wut
23:55 +Bazerka: you're on a 128MB VPS or something?
23:55 +billnye: it's not RUNNING in the background
23:55 +Koffa: some 4M RES
23:55 +Koffa: GASP
23:55 +dunpeal: billnye: hm, what do you mean
23:56 +dunpeal: I assumed perl was embedded
23:56 +billnye: it's loaded, but it's not DOING anything unless you have scripts running... and then it's only doing as much or as little as the scripts require
