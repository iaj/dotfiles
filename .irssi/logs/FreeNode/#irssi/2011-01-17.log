00:52 +bikcmp: hi all, how can I get notices from *serv to appear in the current window i'm in
00:52 +bikcmp: and not in a seperate window.
00:52 +billnye: only from nickserv/chanserv, or all notices?
00:52 +billnye: (hint: all notices is easier)
00:52 +bikcmp: from network services
00:52 +bikcmp: billnye: fine then, all notices :)
00:52 +spb: you could probably hack up the horrible whois-in-current-window script to do it
00:52 +spb: but it's a stupid idea
00:53 +bikcmp: spb: possibly
00:53 +billnye: bikcmp: what's your levels line under /window (in the status window)?
00:53 +bikcmp: 23:53:53  Level   : NONE
00:54 +billnye: and here?
00:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
00:54 +bikcmp: billnye: oh, i'm sorry
00:54 +bikcmp: in the STATUS window :p
00:54 +billnye: here it's none?
00:54 +bikcmp: aye
00:55 +bikcmp: here it's none, in status, 23:54:46  Level   : ALL
00:55 +billnye: /win level ALL -NOTICES in status, /layout save and /save if it works for ya
00:56 +bikcmp: nope
00:57 +bikcmp: actually, having queries with them open might not help.
00:57 +billnye: queries are a "better match" than a random window, yes
00:57 +bikcmp: nope
00:57 +billnye: it is helpful, but not for testing :)
00:57 +bikcmp: it opens up another query
00:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisBoy]
00:57 +billnye: bikcmp: what's /set autocreate_query_level set to?
00:58 +billnye: (/me writes a prediction and seals it in an evelope)
00:58 +bikcmp: 23:58:12  [lookandfeel]
00:58 +bikcmp: 23:58:12  autocreate_query_level = MSGS DCCMSGS
00:58 +billnye: as you'll see in the envelope, my prediction was that you were testing with /msg nick|chanserv blahblahb
00:59 +bikcmp: exactly.
00:59 +billnye: and thus creating your own query on outgoing message
00:59 +bikcmp: billnye: magic :P
00:59 * billnye bows
00:59 +billnye: but yeah, /^msg chanserv blahblah instead
00:59 +billnye: ^ for silent/noecho/unlogged
01:00 +billnye: handy only-semi-documented feature, that
01:00 +bikcmp: doesn't work.  I did /^msg chanserv bleh
01:00 +bikcmp: opens up another window (176)
01:01 +billnye: and that's a NEW window?
01:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nazgul101]
01:01 +bikcmp: aye.
01:01 +bikcmp: i /wc it and it reopens when I /^msg.
01:02 +bikcmp: be back in a tad
01:02 +tmr: billnye, only-semi-documented? It's clearly explained in the manual.
01:03 +billnye: which manual?
01:03 +tmr: irssi manual.. manual.txt Chapter 12. Commands.
01:05 +billnye: yep
01:05 +billnye: right where it belongs ;)
01:05 +billnye: my impression was based on the fact that it's used but completely glossed over in the startup howto

01:21 +webvictim: /window 20
01:23 +cafaro: ok thanks
01:29 +bikcmp: billnye: okay, back.
01:30 +billnye: cafaro: meta-left/right only goes to sticky windows, ^N ^P is next/prev by number, /win ## and /win goto #name works, and there's a modified dispatch.pl that allows /32 for jumping to window 32
01:30 +billnye: bikcmp: so'm I :)

01:43 +bikcmp: billnye: any ideas on the notice thing, still?

01:45 +bikcmp: k
01:46 +bikcmp: worked...
01:46 +bikcmp: lol
01:46 +bikcmp: billnye: :)
01:46 +billnye: so why didn't /^msg work too, is the question

09:42 +Koffa: exactly
09:43 +Koffa: anything coming in creates a window, but only outbound /query creates one

09:43 +Koffa: I've done this config like 10yrs ago, dunno which settings are relevant :)

09:44 +ordex: cool ;)
09:44 +royale1223_: thanks guys

11:02 +srk9: By the way, why do I have a + next to my name?
11:02 +Tm_T: yes, you can connect to multiple servers
11:03 +Brownout: use /connect instead of /server
11:03 +Tm_T: and identified (?) users are voiced here
11:03 +srk9: Is it possible to have a different nick on a different server?
11:03 +p4aved: yes
11:03 +Tm_T: yes
11:04 +p4aved: srk9: try /help server
11:04 +p4aved: or it might be network you specify nick
11:05 +Tm_T: one can simply /nick on the active server
11:06 +Tm_T: and/or provide the nick at the connect time, see /help connect
11:06 +srk9: Tm_T: What happens if there is a channel name collison between two servers when I try joining a channel?
11:06 +Tm_T: srk9: there wont be any collision, only one server is active at a time
11:07 +srk9: Tm_T: How do you determine which server is active? Can you change the active server?
11:07 +Tm_T: active in this context means "you join only in that server"
11:07 +Tm_T: srk9: ^X
11:08 +srk9: Tm_T: Ah, cool. Thanks.
11:08 +tmr: (in itemless window, like (status))
11:08 +srk9: Anyway, I just connected to a new server. Does anyone know how I can find out about getting a mask on it like I have on freenode?
11:08 +Tm_T: yup, those actually say it nicely, like here: [1:freenode (change with ^X)]
11:08 +Tm_T: srk9: not all servers provide such things
11:09 +tmr: You should refer network documentation.
11:10 +srk9: Is there a conventional way of finding that or does it vary depending on the server?
11:10 +Tm_T: it all depends on the server/network
11:11 +srk9: Okay, thanks.

14:11 +giles: lol
14:11 +hyperair: =p
14:13 +giles: yeah, that solves a specific requirement, but I am interested in a more general solution. just want to use irssi as a sort of irc bot backend.
14:13 +hyperair: you could write a script in irssi that polls a pipe
14:13 +giles: hyperair: so how might I use pipes?
14:13 +hyperair: giles: mkfifo
14:13 +hyperair: giles: and keep polling it until there's stuff to read from it
14:13 +hyperair: via a script
14:14 +hyperair: you'll have to write it yourself though
14:14 +giles: right
14:14 +hyperair: then you can just echo "blah blah" > /path/to/pipe/fil
14:14 +hyperair: e
14:14 +giles: so the irssi signals are for c programming API?
14:15 +hyperair: no, those are for the Perl scripting API
14:15 +giles: http://irssi.org/documentation/signals
14:15 +Rhonda: That's why he said "via a script" and not "via a plugin" :)
14:15 +hyperair: you can use timers and a subroutine that polls the file handle until there's stuff to read
14:15 +hyperair: giles: those signals are for the scripting interface
14:16 +hyperair: giles: go to scripts.irssi.org and download a few to see how it's done
14:17 +giles: I need the oposite of act_fifo.pl

15:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Genieliu]
15:03 +qpdb: is it possible to set different proxies for different servers?
15:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kipibenkipod]
15:06 +incandenza: yes, you just do something like /set irssiproxy_ports server1=7890 server2=7891 server3=7892
15:08 +qpdb: mh, is irssiproxy the same as a using a usual proxy? i thought irssiproxy is some kind of BNC functionality
15:08 +incandenza: oh, I see what you mean.  in that case I don't know
15:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shamrock]
15:14 +ds187: qpdb: yes it is kind of a BNC
15:15 +ds187: you set it up matching your "normal" irssi servers and networks, and then you can connect from another computer to that instance
15:15 +qpdb: thats not what i intend to do.. i just want to use a proxy for some servers, and use no proxy for other servers
15:16 +incandenza: it looks like there is a /server -noproxy option
15:17 +incandenza: that ignores the global proxy setting
15:18 +qpdb: ahh, nice one! i'll try that.. thanks ;)

19:49 @Dirm: Ziber: why do you want to get it from the server name when you can get it from the server rec directly?

19:53 +Ziber: I'm working on a hilight patch,t o autohilight by nickname on the current server.
19:55 +Ziber: does dest have a ->server attr?

19:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mcjb]
19:56 +Ziber: oh, cool, thanks :)
19:56 @Dirm: if you're poking around in the source, you could just look at the definition of TEXT_DEST_REC :P

19:56 +Ziber: and yeah, i shouldve.
19:56 +Ziber: or, should, rather.
19:58 @Dirm: yeah you can look at the hilight or ignore or lastlog source to see how they do regex
19:58 @Dirm: maybe not quite "like in perl" though :)

23:58 +Bazerka: ent0: trackbar is a script

23:59 +Bazerka: nightfrog: ok, thanks
23:59 +nightfrog: i tried all kinds of options though thining that was it
23:59 +ent0: Bazerka: I don't see the line when I switch rooms, so I guess it isn't enabled.
