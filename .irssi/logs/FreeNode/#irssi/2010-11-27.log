16:47 +anon33_: i've moved a script to ~/.irssi/scripts/<script>.pl and typed /script load <path/to/script>.pl
16:47 +anon33_: yet nothing took effect - any ideas?
16:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v suiside]
16:48 +sjk: anon33_, does it not appear in /script list?
16:49 +znx: anon33_: /script load scriptname
16:49 +znx: it will then say something like "script loaded" on the (status) window
16:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SS3]
16:49 +anon33_: yes and yea, it said script loaded
16:51 +anon33_: script in question is - https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/blob/vim_mode_1.0/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl
16:52 +anon33_: any help would be greatly appreciated
16:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v suiside]
16:55 +znx: anon33_: there is #irssi_vim channel .. shabble is here as well
16:55 +znx: you'll need to ask him about that particular script
16:57 +anon33_: znx: thanks :)

17:57 +sapht: hey, how can i remap Ctrl-p and Ctrl-p to history up/down?
17:58 +sapht: i managed to map ctrl-l to "clear" before but then i used "command" as an ID in the map, which does not seem to be the type of action you need for history-up/down
17:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
18:02 +peth: sapht: /bind ^N forward_history will do. see /help bind
18:02 +sapht: how do i map that in config?
18:03 +sapht: or can i compile the config from the binds somehow?
18:03 +peth: you do /bind ^N forward_history and then /save.
18:03 +sapht: alright ty :)
18:08 +sapht: wow my reason for failing earlier was typing the action as "history_forward" in the config. now that's an awkward mistake to make :) ty again i figured out how to make ctrl-b and ctrl-f act up now too :P

18:33 +Datz: sneep: ah thanks I should have figured.  I tried /help level instead :p
18:33 +Datz: pretty cool funtion I didn't know of.
18:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisBoy]
18:35 +Datz: not that it's too important, but I was wondering if I could clear text from a given period.
18:39 +Datz: I'm also having trouble getting levelclear to work
18:39 +Datz: something like "/sb levelclear JOINS" isn't removing joins from scrollback
