00:29 +billnye: sjk: my Quake config script days taught me the magic of binds that modify binds
00:30 +billnye: two aliases, each that perform a task and bind a key to the other alias
00:30 +billnye: then bind the key to either alias, and then it'll function as a toggle
00:31 +Remco: Be careful not to create infinite loops ;)
00:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Hero_of_Mordor]
00:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v badcloud]
00:33 +billnye: Remco: that's easy, just create a watchdog alias that performs a generalized solution to the halting problem before allowing any alias to be set
00:33 +Remco: :P
00:34 +billnye: s/to the/of the/
00:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SpitfireWP]
00:35 +badcloud: how can I get nicklist.pl to not block channel/window text?
00:35 * billnye also wonders idly what purpose quintopia's blasphemous "better-than-regex regex" would be serving
00:36 +badcloud: is it possible to set irssi window width?
00:36 +Nei: use a vertical split in tmux/screen and the "fifo" mode
00:36 +badcloud: and if I'm using screen?
00:37 +billnye: oh, in that case use a vertical split in tmux/screen and the fifo mode ;D
00:37 +Nei: (make sure you're using screen with vertical split patch)
00:37 +billnye: (I don't use nicklist, just pointing out that it didn't contravene Nei's suggestion)
00:37 +billnye: contraindicate?
00:38 +billnye: contra-extra-mans-code, I think is the word I was looking for
00:39 +badcloud: billnye: *and* the fifo mode??
00:39 +billnye: badcloud: screen-the-program and fifo-the-mode, yes, was Nei's suggestion
00:40 +billnye: (or one of the two options he suggested)
00:40 +Remco: There is a screen mode and a fifo mode
00:40 +Remco: Not a screen + fifo mode afaik
00:40 +Remco: (which I think is what he was trying to say)
00:40 +badcloud: right
00:40 +billnye: fifo the mode sounds like a Star Wars character
00:41 +badcloud: but there's no way to alter irssi window's width?
00:41 +billnye: or a small dog
00:41 +billnye: badcloud: you shouldn't need ot
00:41 +billnye: afaik, anyway
00:41 +Remco: badcloud: Read text inside the script, it should be set in there somewhere
00:41 +badcloud: Remco: will do
00:43 +billnye: if 'tis better to give than receive, this should be the season when I spuriously trigger OTHER people's hilights ;)
00:45 +jjcm: I will fight you billnye
00:49 +billnye: jjcm: it's okay, you're not talking about holiday plans, so you're off the hook :)
00:50 +badcloud: yeah, I'm not getting what the problem is. "If your irssi doesn't resize properly, and the text from irssi and the nicklist overlap, make sure you're running the latest version.
00:50 +badcloud: "
00:50 +badcloud: I'm running the latest v
00:51 +jjcm: billnye: I want you to know that I got very excited when I saw your reply, but only because I had accidentally closed the window I was chatting with my gf in, and #irssi replaced my window 11
00:51 +jjcm: billnye: You were not nearly as sexy
00:52 +billnye: jjcm: so in a manner of speaking, I almost DID trigger spurious hilights!
00:52 +jjcm: billnye: Sure.
00:52 +jjcm: And a word of christmas advice to you all - always have your ladyfriends in window 11
00:52 +jjcm: that way you only have to move one finger only slightly to hit command+q
00:53 +jjcm: for when she inevitably starts bitching
00:53 +jjcm: This has been another exciting session of, "Wise words of jjcm." Tune in next week when he interviews your mother.
00:54 +stoned: oh
00:54 +stoned: xmodmap will work yes, but I'm on irssi for windows
00:54 +stoned: with active perl
00:54 +jjcm: *shudder*
00:54 +stoned: and I putty into local winssh server
00:55 +stoned: and run cygwin bash/irssi
00:55 +jjcm: D:
00:55 +stoned: so I need to make my left alt key also the meta key
00:55 +jjcm: stoned: The amount of paradigms you're mixing is explosive
00:55 +stoned: is there anyway to bind this using /bind
00:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Smiley__1]
00:56 +billnye: shouldn't it already Just Work?
00:56 +stoned: sicne alt is already bound to the meta key, is there any keycode to duplicate that for this one?
00:56 +stoned: no
00:56 +stoned: it doesn't bill
00:56 +stoned: I wonder... I hope its not a putty thing..
00:56 +billnye: putty'd be the stage in that process that I'd worry least about, tbh
00:56 --- Smiley__1 is now known as Smiley
00:56 +jjcm: stoned: Alt works fine for me in putty
00:56 +jjcm: stoned: but then again I'm usually ssh'd into a nix box
00:57 +jjcm: (a native one rather)
00:57 +stoned: jkwhat's your keyboard?
00:57 +stoned: jjcm, *
00:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mingdao_]
00:57 +billnye: what do you get when you exit irssi and run cat in the shell?
00:57 +jjcm: US-en
00:57 +stoned: no
00:57 +stoned: in putty
00:57 +jjcm: oh
00:57 +jjcm: Whatever the default is
00:57 +mauke: heh, "US-en"
00:57 +jjcm: I haven't changed it
00:57 +mauke: as opposed to "US-mx" or something?
00:57 +billnye: none of those settings appear to be related to alt/meta
00:57 +jjcm: mauke: As oppsed to UK-en
00:58 +billnye: US-mx \o/
00:58 +stoned: Phm
00:58 +billnye: not even US-es, US-mx
00:58 +stoned: yeah, alt here never takes effect (right alt)
00:58 +jjcm: Hmm
00:58 +jjcm: I usually use my left alt
00:58 +billnye: stoned: why right alt?
00:58 +jjcm: Cant vouge for whether or not the right one works
00:59 +jjcm: (and I'm not near a windows box at the moment)
00:59 +billnye: right alt doesn't here in just putty(ssh)->*nix
00:59 +stoned: oh
00:59 +mauke: I don't have a right alt key
00:59 +stoned: cuz i have a stupid ms natural split keyboard
00:59 +stoned: i like it
01:00 +jjcm: model M is where it's at
01:00 +stoned: but i can't use left alt + right side of keyboard
01:00 +stoned: i have small hands
01:00 +stoned: well one hand
01:01 +billnye: jjcm: ^5
01:01 +stoned: I can do it with two hands but I can't with one hand
01:01 +stoned: hand span isn't large enough
01:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Smiley]
01:01 +stoned: so if i can make my right alt key work
01:01 +billnye: aside from the lack of (I could do without Win/)Menu keys
01:01 +stoned: then I can just switch windows or what not with one hand the right side
01:01 +jjcm: Actually any buckling spring keyboard will do
01:01 +jjcm: right now I use the das keyboards
01:01 +billnye: but there's always shift+F10
01:01 +jjcm: I have two of them, one at home and one at work

02:06 +billnye: if you move the last sticky item out of a container (/win move up/down/whatever), the split will close
02:08 +feld: hi guys... quick question about irssi proxy. I've lived with this for forever, but it gets rather annoying -- how do i stop this from happening: If I do a query/privmsg with a user on the irssi instance running the proxy it causes the irssi clients ...
02:08 +feld: ... connected to the proxy to see two query/privmsg windows: one for me, one for the person i'm talking to.
02:09 +feld: I can't confirm right now as I don't have multiple clients connected but I think this just happens in general if I have multiple clients connected... the other active clients see two conversations instead
