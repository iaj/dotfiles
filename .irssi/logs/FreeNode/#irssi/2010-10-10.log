00:00 +shabble: can you pastebin the output?
00:00 +jink: Unless it's bound to a specific ip.
00:00 +NiveusLuna: sec
00:03 +NiveusLuna: http://pastebin.com/2paADtDz
00:05 +shabble: is 8888 the one you've got setup?
00:05 +NiveusLuna: no
00:05 +shabble: which is?
00:06 +NiveusLuna: 2227, and tthe ones like 2345, etc
00:06 +shabble: ok, that is strange. They do appear to be listening ony on ipv6
00:07 +shabble: what is the value of /set irssiproxy_bind ?
00:07 +NiveusLuna: that... wasn't in the documentation
00:08 +NiveusLuna: unset
00:08 +NiveusLuna: no value
00:08 +shabble: hmm, try setting it to 0.0.0.0
00:09 +NiveusLuna: set.
00:09 +shabble: does netstat show any difference?
00:09 +NiveusLuna: no
00:09 +shabble: hmm
00:10 +shabble: you could try /unload proxy hten /load proxy
00:10 +shabble: see if it picks up the new values
00:10 +shabble: but I don't think that hsould be necessary
00:10 +shabble: otherwise, I'm out of ideas.
00:10 +NiveusLuna: 1there we go
00:10 +NiveusLuna: now to try it
00:11 +NiveusLuna: does irssi-proxy support ssl?
00:11 +shabble: afaik no
00:11 +shabble: best approach for security is to set _bind to 127.0.0.1, then set up an ssh forward to it
00:11 +NiveusLuna: well, gsm is by default encrypted...
00:12 +NiveusLuna: i'm only interested in using it as a proxy with andchat. nothing else.

00:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v NiveusLuna]
00:26 +NiveusLuna: Aww. Can't use irssi's aliases.
00:26 +NiveusLuna: From andchat.
00:26 +arachnist: ofcourse not
00:27 +NiveusLuna: I figured that since i'd be using irssi-proxy as a bouncer, i'd be able to use its aliases.
00:27 +NiveusLuna: Maybe that logic wasn't so great
00:29 +NiveusLuna: That's a pity, I like andchat's interface.

00:38 +owen1: how to scroll when using screen?
00:38 +NiveusLuna: page up and page down
00:38 +owen1: i try ctrl+A+esc and pageup, but it's not working
00:38 +owen1: NiveusLuna: too easy to be true (-:
00:39 +xand: just page up
00:44 +owen1: nice!

00:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Adaemon]
00:55 +Adaemon: recently I was told that there's an irssi script for tying in with the ubuntu toaster notifications, I actually wrote my own, but it's garbage ("Ademan" is hard coded into it) I originally wrote it because I couldn't find one already, I tried looking again today, and I still can't find it... am I blind?
01:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nazgul101]
01:07 +Rado: I want to redirect some string-match from 1 window to another. I can't use "gui print text" signal, because it operates on message elements rather than whole lines.
01:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v aleX-xx]
01:08 +Rado: So I use "print text" signal. This uses "dest, text, stripped" arguments. I assumed I have to change "$dest->{'window'}" to redirect the output then with "signal_continue".
01:09 +Rado: However, I assign the result of "Irssi::window_find_name", is that the correct "value"?
01:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v blkno1]
01:13 +Rado: Problem is: I can change the text, it's modified when matched, but the window doesn't change.
01:27 +Remco: I'd say you have to 'send' it to the other window, and stop the current one
01:28 +Remco: Sort of like hilightwin.pl copies the message

01:41 +eboyjr: Can I make irssi autoreply to anyone who mentions my name with the words 'thanks' with "nick: No problem anytime"?
01:41 +eboyjr: without scripts?
01:41 +eboyjr: or with scripts
01:47 +dtm: eboyjr: i would guess so, at least until someone says "no thanks, you jerk!!!"
01:47 +dtm: eboyjr: ;)
01:48 +eboyjr: heh id want to sound sarcastic in that case
01:48 +dtm: oh, okay.  well yeah i bet a script can have a pretty sophisticated regexp! ;)
01:49 +dtm: eboyjr: i'd think that i'd not want an autoreply, but rather, a manual script.
01:49 +dtm: so you could type '/yw' and it'd look in the history for the last person who said "eboyjr: ....thanks!...." and autoreply to them, then.  you know, once you've QAd the situation.
01:50 +dtm: eboyjr: just a suggestion!
01:50 +eboyjr: that makes sense heh
01:51 +dtm: of course that makes it harder, but then, i have no clue how to do *any* of it, so i may as well suggest that!
01:52 +eboyjr: I might have to learn perl then
02:07 +yitz_: billnye: nack script -> would it make some sense to order the window selection by the order in which you last said something?
02:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v remyo]
02:26 +Adaemon: so, is there a plugin that notifies you of PMs and replies using ubuntu's toaster popups? ( specifically, tells org.freedesktop.Notifications )
02:39 +yitz_: See trigger.pl and some cusomt commands

05:45 +Bazerka: bah
05:46 +Bazerka: scolled up ftl
05:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Genieliu]
05:48 * Bazerka grabs shabble's scrolled_reminder.pl
05:49 +yitz_: Put that up on the site?
05:49 +Bazerka: not for me to unilaterally add scripts without the author requesting it
05:50 +Bazerka: also, not sure what the policy is on scripts that have dependancies on other scripts
05:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ampzqlox]
06:01 +arachnist: Bazerka: those scripts are great (the scrolled reminder and prompt info). thanks :)
06:01 +arachnist: also
06:01 +arachnist: shabble: thanks for the great scripts :)
06:03 +Bazerka: arachnist: you may also want to take a look at rl_history_search.pl (another of shabble's)
06:03 +Bazerka: to give bash like searching of input prompt history
06:04 +Bazerka: very useful :)
06:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v preller]
06:28 +arachnist: http://lionel.lefolgoc.net/misc/tmux_away.pl - this one also seems useful
06:28 +arachnist: (and actually works)
06:28 * yitz_ got screen_away working
06:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
06:45 +Bazerka: tmux != screen != tmux
06:45 +Bazerka: so completely unrelated :)
06:51 +Bazerka: arachnist: yup, that is useful - although I stopped using /away long before I migrated from screen to tmux
06:51 * Bazerka grabs a copy for posterity however
06:56 +billnye: yitz_: if you build it, I'll give it a shot
06:57 +yitz_: I wanted thoughts before I bothered starting... :P
06:57 +yitz_: Should be easier enough I think. Might try tomorrow
06:57 +billnye: yitz_: I didn't create the current ack, just the mods that made it duplicate the "old" behavior... but I think that's possibly a useful option to have
06:58 +yitz_: We'll see if I've got time tomorrow
06:59 +billnye: can't guarantee prompt responses, but feel free to PM me with any discussion/suggestions/results :)

07:22 +tsp: Where else? I thought this was irssi's home channel.
