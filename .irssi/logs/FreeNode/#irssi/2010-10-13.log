10:44 +feduc: anyone have a good sample file
10:44 +feduc: sample .conf
10:44 +feduc: with a few example servers/channels
10:45 +zmx: feduc: probably your package distrib.
10:45 +zmx: and why do you want a sample "file" ?
10:46 +cromag: irssi will create the standard config if it doesnt have it.
10:46 +cromag: so mv config to .bak and start irssi.
10:50 +feduc: theres no example channels
10:50 +feduc: the standard conf is not help for multiple servers and channels
10:50 +feduc: it shows you one server and channel
10:50 +feduc: not the syntax for multiple
10:51 +feduc: zmx
10:51 +feduc: lol
10:51 +feduc: not the file
10:51 +feduc: the .conf code
10:51 +feduc: you could just paste to my window
10:52 +feduc: in a /query of sql
10:52 +tmr: irssi does not create standard config, it copies system default.
10:52 +zmx: use irssi command for adding server/channel
10:52 +feduc: it noobaneese
10:52 +feduc: in noob language?
10:52 +tmr: http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c3
10:53 +feduc: tmr: the .conf that tells irssi how to act is irssi.conf , with this it has your own personall channels/servers etc
10:53 +feduc: ive found them online examples before
10:54 +feduc: why would I /add network
10:54 +feduc: all this work has been done already
10:54 +feduc: i just need to edit a .txt file
10:54 +feduc: ill find it, overly complex europeans/foreigners ...
10:54 +zmx: The manual edit of the .conf file is not covered by the waranty
10:55 +tmr: You're free to do that, but you're on your own.
10:55 +feduc: ...
10:55 +feduc: if theres a command
10:55 +feduc: why have a .conf file
10:55 +feduc: it should be stored in variables
10:55 +feduc: and pointers
10:55 +feduc: $asm->0xxx0020202
10:56 +tmr: Uh.. You dont never reboot?
10:56 +zmx: because, variable and pointers die at the end of the software :p
10:56 +feduc: no you'd export the pointers to a USB memory card
10:56 +feduc: called D-ram usb
10:57 +deryni: Which would be a config file.
10:57 +zmx: so, you want a sample file. Create a server/channel with the command.
10:57 +feduc: no
10:57 +zmx: Save it
10:57 +feduc: it would be D-ram
10:57 +zmx: edit it
10:57 +feduc: it would have a dime-cell
10:57 +feduc: to keep charge
10:57 +tmr: Oh, troll...
10:57 +feduc: lol but wait tmr
10:57 +feduc: troll
10:57 +feduc: files are not covered by warrenty
10:57 +feduc: ...
10:58 +feduc: tmr: <zmx> The manual edit of the .conf file is not covered by the waranty
10:58 +deryni: This channel doesn't support manually editing the configuration file except in *very* specific circumstances.
10:58 +tmr: This i not one of 'em.
10:59 +tmr: s/i /is /
10:59 +zmx: feduc: you can edit the irssi binary if you want too ... But that's not the supposed way to do thing with irssi
11:00 +feduc: tell me what takes longer
11:00 +feduc: editing the conf
11:00 +feduc: and adding a server command
11:00 +feduc: or adding /new server <server ip>
11:00 +feduc: and typing this in the program
11:00 +zmx: probably editing the conf
11:00 +feduc: lol
11:00 +feduc: your waisting time typing /new server
11:00 +zmx: especially when you need to ask in this channel =)
11:00 +feduc: you're wasting life
11:01 +feduc: lol
11:01 +feduc: i'll save these moments
11:01 +feduc: from all the times i would be an idiot typing /new server over and over
11:01 +zmx: And your wasting time to open the file, find the good line, find the good syntax, etc ..
11:01 +Steve57:  /new server?
11:02 +feduc: yah , I like finding syntax
11:02 +zmx: Steve57: He call abourt /server add I think
11:02 +deryni: The /commands are documented, the file format is not. You chose to waste your time asking instead of reading, that's your call. I'm done wasting my time on this conversation, bye.
11:02 +Steve57: zmx, ah ok
11:03 +feduc: its not editing the binary deryni
11:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v invalidrecord]
11:03 +feduc: just adding a few lines to a .conf
11:04 +feduc: its strange that this is not supported
11:04 +feduc: but a waste of time/space in commands is suported
11:04 +tmr: Use weechat if config editing is life changing requirement for you, their new parser is apparently mde to handle human errors.
11:06 +feduc: oh I see, if you are on a system with no file access
11:07 +tmr: For fucks sake..
11:07 +feduc: and when  you boot kernel it autoloads irssi and unmounts fs from read/write
11:07 +feduc: then, you might actually need /Network add functions
11:07 +tmr: Commands would be fucking useless then.
11:07 +feduc: weechat sucks
11:08 +feduc: irssi or bitchx is all that is used in the world really
11:08 +feduc: commands wouldn't be uselss, it'd be the only way to control the app
11:08 +feduc: unless you have root
11:09 +FlashCode: feduc: you're wrong, weechat is widely used, more than you think ;)
11:10 +feduc: yes Ive seen it on a few box's
11:10 +feduc: depends on the admin, some install it if you ask nicely
11:11 +feduc: oh its even in the topic
11:12 +feduc: Do not edit the config file by hand...
11:12 +feduc: why
11:12 +FlashCode: tmr: weechat will discard lines if they're wrong in config files, and in weechat, it's NOT recommended to edit files by hand too
11:12 +feduc: if it doesn't work, it wont work...no biggie
11:13 +feduc: FlashCode: why not weechat either?
11:13 +feduc: why store information in .conf's then
11:13 +FlashCode: because it's faster to use /set, and safer (values are checked when you do that)
11:13 +tmr: FlashCode, OK, I thought it was unsupported too but I was clamed otherwise, now I know.
11:13 +feduc: why not store it in the binary , or in memory
11:13 +tmr: Claimed*
11:13 +FlashCode: a config file in binary, wtf?
11:14 +FlashCode: you can edit, just it's not recommended
11:14 +feduc: yes, if " Do *not* edit the config file" is in the topic
11:14 +feduc: of your app
11:14 +feduc: the .conf should be broken up
11:14 +feduc: into several structs
11:14 +tmr: Useless.
11:15 +feduc: and hidden in various places across the puter
11:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Neo|Desktop]
11:15 +Babar: right... obfuscate the config file to try and prevent dumb users from editing it?
11:15 +feduc: it'll be like finding a serial generator
11:15 +Babar: no, just tell them to edit it at their own risk.
11:16 +feduc: Im sure if users want to edit it
11:16 +feduc: they can reverse engineer it
11:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zambezi]
11:16 +feduc: lol, stupid people using Irssi?

11:17 +tmr: It's in the irss source, good luck.
11:18 +Steve57: don't ask me, i'm still trying to figure out why typing "/new server Freenode" isn't working. :p
11:19 +feduc: lol
11:19 +feduc: ill write a script for you
11:19 +feduc: in perl
11:19 +tmr: Steve57, just fix your new alis.
11:19 +feduc: "/new server" will open "/network add $"
11:19 +Steve57: tmr: ;)
11:19 +tmr: Alias..
11:20 +zmx: feduc: conf file in plain text is better for versionning. And we don't need to crypt it
11:20 +feduc: or TCL
11:20 +feduc: ill put it on a eggdrop for you
11:21 +feduc: it'll link to your irssi box through telnet
11:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
11:21 +feduc: or can be on the same box
11:22 +feduc: i should be complaining about lack of GUI for irssi

22:02 +malikeye|2: thanks of the info :)
22:03 +yitz_: billnye: I *think* it works now
22:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
22:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip]
22:15 +yitz_: billnye: Wanna try?
22:16 +yitz_: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/275143/  and /toggle ack_use_last_spoke
22:18 +yitz_: This sort of pushes sorting by refnum down to only be used in windows you never spoke in...
22:19 +yitz_: It might make sense to timestamp when you last_spoke in a channel and, say, just priotize the recently used channels above the rest but not one over the other. Or the last X channels vs a timeout
22:19 +billnye: if you're going to start throwing the sort into settings, I'd suggest revising the entire script to read a comma-separated sequence and sort by those keys, much like actlist_sort does
22:19 +billnye: $0.02
22:20 +billnye: I don't know how we'd have to revise the "guts" to make that change though
22:21 +billnye: I'll be able to give it a try in a bit when I get off work
22:22 +yitz_: I'm not gonna bother with settings right now. That setting just lets you toggle this new feature on/off
22:22 +billnye: <nod> but it's an override to the entire rest of the sorting, yes?
22:22 +yitz_: I'm pretty sure this setup I coded isn't the best. It seems to work, but that doesn't mean it "feels right"
22:23 +yitz_: Um... Not entirely. The rest of the sorting kicks in on channels without a last_spoke
22:23 +yitz_: ie if you never spoke in it
22:24 +billnye: okay, I hadn't thought that far ahead, but it still fits... the setting being on "automatically promotes it to first-in-line" as a better wording than "overrides"
22:25 +billnye: as I said, not able to test just now, but interesting so far :)
22:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
22:26 +yitz_: I'm probably gonna end up switching it to using last_spoke that are "recent" and/or with a cutoff. And maybe/maybenot promoting last_spoke channels over each other. It needs user thoughts and feedback :S
22:30 +yitz_: So... anyone here interested in trying an alternate ack-channel-selector?
22:31 +billnye: yitz_: I never particularly liked the fact that the current ack didn't have an externally-configurable priority list, but I was too inexperienced/lazy to add that in myself as I was making my changes
22:33 +billnye: ideally we'd back-contact Messr. Rocco for permission/coordination :)
22:33 +yitz_: Heh. Three versions ago?
22:33 +billnye: :D
22:34 +billnye: well I never originally intended to start redistributing :<
22:34 +yitz_: lol
22:34 +yitz_: I'm glad you did :)
22:34 +yitz_: I like this idea of auto-prioritizing based on last_spokes but it needs to be figured out properly
22:34 +billnye: I made some changes for myself, then the .12 changes created a niche for a pre-configured version mimicking the old behavior
22:35 +billnye: et voila, I accidentally became a link in the chain
22:35 +billnye: yitz_: yeah, I'm up for some brainstorming later

23:00 +tsp: if I"m flipping through channels, someone speaks on a channel I just left and <esc>a brings me to it again

23:19 +tsp: tsolox: is there a #procmail?
23:19 +tsp: maildrop > procmail IMO

23:21 +dngor: Now you have two problems: you're blind, and you're using emacs.
23:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v grindking]
23:22 +yitz_: lol
23:23 +tsp: emacspeak can work, but I have to do everything in emacs and rewrite the part of emacspeak I don't like because it's mega slow
23:23 +tsolox: tsp: ?
23:23 +tsp: tsolox: ?
23:24 +tsp: tsolox: your question seems to be related to procmail and not mutt
23:25 +billnye: tsp: haven't read the entire scroll, but I have priority to OLDEST activity first, precisely to avoid those loops you mean. It's the complaint that led to someone handing me the script in the first place (though it's beem modified slightly since, and even LESS-SLIGHTly now)
23:26 +billnye: dngor: are, or know? :)
23:26 +tsp: is it possible to scroll up to the last hilight?
23:27 +dngor: billnye: Rocco?  Am. :)
23:27 +billnye: dngor: OHAI, WE MADE U A REVISIONS
23:28 +dngor: I'll put it on github.  I have so many wee projects without proper repots.
23:28 +billnye: dngor: me and yitz_ are still kinda brainstorming this latest change, my own changes were minor till now
23:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lamstyle]
23:29 +dngor: The original hack was the best way I could figure out at the time.  Progress happens, and the code must abide.
23:29 +yitz_: Jumping to the most recent activity when you just spoke in that channel sounds like a positive thing
23:29 +billnye: yitz_: depends what your aim is :)
23:30 +yitz_: To follow/participate in a conversation?
23:30 +billnye: yitz_: (but I agree that "just spoke there" is indeed a possible game-changer on priorities)
23:31 +yitz_: Yeah. Ordering entirely by last_spoke order is dumb. I'm thinking a time cut-off and channel cutoff makes sense
23:32 +billnye: off the top of my head, my priority list might end up running something like mosturgent->lastspoke->oldestact
23:33 +billnye: a configurable off/duration timeout sounds like a great idea
23:33 +yitz_: I still got the priority act hack sitting higher than lastspoke
23:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jaminja]
23:33 +ferret: I don't see why lastspoke is of the least bit important
23:34 +ferret: If it is, it's a totally different kind of importance
23:34 +ferret: It might tell you e.g. where the most active conversations are right now
23:34 +billnye: ferret: then you'd leave it out of the list, either manually or settingsly
23:34 +dngor: billnye yitz_: Good sirs, please direct your patches to http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack
23:35 +yitz_: dngor: OK :)
23:36 +ferret: fwiw, my *personal* preference would be hilighted oldest to newest, then normal messages oldest to newest, then (optionally?) crap oldest to newest
23:36 +yitz_: ferret: That's billnye's setup
23:36 +billnye: ferret: my current version of ack does that just fine
23:36 +ferret: k
23:36 +dngor: It does sort in descending order of data_level, if that means anything.
23:36 +billnye: ferret: but still requires script editing to change your mind on priority
23:36 +ferret: ahh
23:37 +ferret: I can see why people might want slight changes, e.g., hilight newest to oldest instead, or not doing hilight at all (because they have a hilightwin)
23:38 +billnye: dngor: my changes were at http://billnye.blinkenshell.org/irssi/ack.txt and the "behave like 0.8.12" version was http://billnye.blinkenshell.org/irssi/ack.0.8.12.txt
23:38 +billnye: essentially only changing the sort list, in both cases
23:39 +yitz_: I'm debating whether the order of last_spoke should matter or not. I guess that could be a flag
23:39 +billnye: yitz_: I'm thinking forward and reverse sorting on all keys
23:40 +dngor: Create a hash of sort-option to sort function, $sort{like_0_8_12} = \&sort_like_0_8_12, then make an option to select which to use.
23:40 +dngor: sort $sort_func{$sort_option} grep ....;
23:40 +ferret: o.O
23:40 +ferret: Surely it doesn't actually use sort
23:41 +billnye: dngor: I'd say leave it manual, but include a note that 0.8.12 version is "/set ack_sort +level,+refnum" or whatever
23:41 +ferret: Finding the minimum of a set optimally doesn't require sorting
23:41 +billnye: ferret: go ahead! git yer fingers in the pie!
23:42 +dngor: Patches now more welcome than ever. http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack/
23:42 +ferret: I know what he meant though, a comparison function
23:42 +ferret: compfunc a b, returning -1 0 1
23:42 +billnye: ferret: looked at the pre-spoke versions yet?
23:43 +ferret: pre-spoke?
23:43 +billnye: dngor's or my links, as opposed to yitz_'s brand new pastebin
23:43 +ferret: I've looked at the one dngor said
23:44 +dngor: ferret: Also, Perl's non-intuitive.  Letting sort() work in-place on a small list may be faster than iterating and comparing in bytecode.  When in doubt, profile.
23:44 +ferret: implementation-wise, you can quite easily do the "/set ack_sort +level,+refnum" thing
23:45 +ferret: dngor: very true... iirc there's a min/max function that takes a comparator function
23:45 +billnye: dunno if it'd be easier to sort that out (NPI) before merging the end product of yitz_' work or not
23:45 +ferret: but it might be in List::MoreUtils so not guaranteed to be on a system
23:45 +dngor: ferret: List::Utils, maybe.  The function's probably similar to that for sort().
23:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CEnTR4L]
23:46 +ferret: Both of those tend to have lovely C implementations, so it might be worth looking to see if there is one, if you like that kind of optimisation :P
23:46 +ferret: Again personally, for "/set ack_sort +level,+refnum" type stuff I would construct an array of subrefs with each comparator function in it in order, then use a loop to iterate through it, breaking if -1 or 1
23:47 +ferret: upon getting to the end of the array, return 0
23:47 +ferret: That in turn is also a comparator function, which you can pass to sort or whatever
23:48 +ferret: I hope that makes sense
23:50 +dngor: foreach (@comparators) { my $value = &$_; return $value if $value } return 0;
23:51 +ferret: aye
23:51 * yitz_ blinks at all this complicated code
23:51 +yitz_: Well, if someone gets the pre-spoke edition working I'd happily shove the spoke and priority stuff in
23:51 +ferret: although #perl people would shoot you for &$_ instead of $_->( args )
23:52 +dngor: pre-spoke is http://paste.pocoo.org/show/275143/ ?
23:52 * dngor handwaves #perl with the "pseudocode" argument.
23:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v remyo]
23:53 +yitz_: dngor: That version got spoke and priorities
23:55 +yitz_: It doesn't really matter what version you chose to work with as long as we're all on the same page
23:55 +dngor: I'm not hacking the script.  I just put it up so people can work on it. :)
23:56 +yitz_: Drat :(
23:56 +yitz_: ferret?
23:56 +ferret: I don't like that version
23:56 +dngor: Sorry... default works "well enough" for me.  If you're stuck on something, maybe we can talk though it?
23:56 +ferret: It's quite complicated
23:57 +ferret: the priority thing I was talking about, dngor just implemented about a third of the code for it in the line up there ^ :P
23:58 +dngor: cmd_ack_add and cmd_ack_del... aren't very clear.  A bit of comment on them to explain what they're doing would go a long way.
23:58 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v UnNamed]
23:59 +dngor: Oh, n/m.  I see now.
