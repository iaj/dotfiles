03:29 +shabble: key handling is custom internal code (not readline, etc)
03:29 +chid: shabble, nah it uses some library :D just wondering about bash keyboard shortcuts, which are the same
03:29 +chid: oh
03:29 +chid: readline
03:29 +chid: thanks
03:29 +shabble: it's /not/ readline
03:29 +shabble: it just acts like it :)
03:30 +chid: yupyup, thanks, shabble, readline is what I was looking for -> runs off and downloads the cheatsheet
03:30 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 91 seconds
03:33 +Bazerka: selective reading :/
03:33 +shabble: yep
03:34 +shabble: then again, I used ot think it was readline based

04:27 +plainas: rite, so I'm an irssi noob, going through docs...
04:27 +plainas: couls anybody link me some basic scripts? i.e side nicklist, buffer manager etc
04:29 +deryni: Have you looked at the scripts page on the site? Also "buffer manager"?
04:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rgr]
04:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v zeiris_]
04:32 +plainas: i saw a script yes,
04:32 +plainas: but what's the difference between... fifo and... window?
04:33 +plainas: also.. by buffer manager i mean something in the lines of vim or emacs... a buffer tat would how a list off buffers
04:34 +deryni: fifo outputs the nicklist to a fifo so you can grab it wherever (useful for screen split windows as I understand it) and window actually uses its own second window (or something like that). From what I recall at least.
04:34 +deryni: chanact or awl can do lists of channels, by default the Act: bar lists channels/windows with activity.
04:35 +Bazerka:  /window list
04:35 +shabble: plainas: I just finished writing a window switcher based on ido-mode for emacs, if you've used such a thing
04:37 +plainas: shabble: i don't know of ido-mode, but i mean somthing like C-x Cb
04:38 +shabble: plainas: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/master/ido-mode/ido_switcher.pl
04:38 +shabble: you'll need the pre-req script listed in the comments at the top though
04:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
04:42 +iaj: is there some way to make irssi to autocomplete from words from the current buffer? :-) ?  (channel that is..)
04:47 +Dirm: iaj: there's a script for that
04:47 +Dirm: irccomplete.pl I think
05:32 +shabble: is listening for 'window item activity' the only way to tell if a window is active?
05:32 +shabble: or is there an after-the-fact access method?

12:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v albacker]
12:59 +p4aved: to set up highlightwin.pl probably read the quadpoint guide by sparks
13:00 +p4aved: to set up nicklist.pl check the script it has a link to the authors site which has instructins

13:07 +albacker: p4aved: heh, thanks, it didnt work :)
13:08 +p4aved: albacker: it can take a bit to set up correctly, you have to turn manual windows on
13:09 +albacker: p4aved: i did.
13:09 +p4aved: have you set albacker to hihglight? /hilight albacker

22:30 +r4: billnye: (billnye)  r4: would you really want your hilights to appear ONLY in some out-of-context window? <-------the plan is to make hilights appear in the chan and a window dedicated to hilights/msgs
22:30 +r4: but i guess thats why i need hilightwin.pl?
22:31 +r4: i was under the impression that i could have levels set for both the main channel window and a window dedicated to hilights so that they would appear in both
22:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v phuzion]
22:34 +Remco: r4: No, a message can only go into one place
22:35 +Remco: That's why the script duplicates the message for the hilight window
22:36 +r4: ahh ok
22:36 +r4: thanks for clearing that up :)
22:37 +r4: im little unclear how the /set use_msgs_window works...is it kinda like how bitlbee treats &bitlbee? (if you are familiar)
22:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lost_soul]
22:39 +r4: although if i use hilightwin.pl....there seems to be no need for enabling that setting
22:40 +Remco: Indeed
22:41 * Remco actually has no idea what that setting does
22:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v grml]
22:43 +Death4Life: hehe :p
22:45 +r4: from my understanding it allows you to forward all msgs to one window
22:45 +r4: kinda like hilightwin.pl but for only msgs
22:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cafaro]
22:51 +billnye: r4: that's what hilightwin.pl is
22:52 +billnye: r4: and use_msgs_window is what you'd do if you didn't want separate query windows per person
22:52 +billnye: (not without manual intervention anyway)
22:52 +billnye: I use both, actually
22:59 +r4: and the ni guess you just address ppl by doing something like "<nick>: msg" sent to that window
22:59 +r4: and it sends a /msg to that person?
22:59 +billnye: no
22:59 +r4: aww :(
22:59 +billnye: that's where the bitlbee parallel breaks down
22:59 +r4: kk
23:00 +billnye: you can /m bi<tab> anyway, and it'll tabcomplete me
23:00 +billnye: shower time though
23:00 +r4: i think what i would like to do is just use hilightwin.pl and set a level for that window to show all of my /msgs
23:00 +r4: and disable hilightwin.pl from showing those (so it doesnt double up on receiving msgs)
23:01 +billnye: oh, you mean a msgs window and hilightwin combined?
23:01 +r4: yep
23:01 +r4: the window (ideally) shows...incoming/receiving msgs and notices
23:01 +billnye: turn on use_msgs_window and change hilightwin.pl to look for (msgs) instead of hilight
23:02 +billnye: I think you might find that you DON'T want your messages to actually be in the hilight win
23:02 +billnye: but it's your experiment
23:02 +r4: true
23:02 +r4: ill just have to play with options and see what i like (im still a newbie to irssi afterall :P)
23:02 +billnye: I would start with just hilightwin
23:03 +r4: thats what i have now
23:03 +r4: i have a basic setup as of now
23:03 +r4: now i want to start messing with level settings
23:03 +billnye: hilightwin is for notification/visibility, and msgs_window is for in and out
23:04 +billnye: as we discussed, they can be combined, but they're really different aims
23:04 +r4: yeah i understand
23:04 +billnye: *gone*
23:04 +r4: cya
