00:21 +Bazerka: aborticide: you can set the sync threshold for large channels (or even turn it off completely)
00:22 +aborticide: what does that do?
00:26 +Bazerka: well eg, if you don't want it to sync large channels, you can set it to 50 or 100
00:27 +Bazerka: if there's more than that number of users in a channel, it'll not sync the entire channel

01:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Drakx]
01:31 +znx: Ignatius: check out the theme register stuff in existing scripts
01:33 +znx: Ignatius: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/active_notice.pl.html  see this for a quick example
01:33 +nightfro`: \003
01:33 +znx: Irssi::theme_register([ 'active_notice_loaded', '%R>>%n %_Scriptinfo:%_ Loaded $0 version $1 by $2.' ]);

01:33 +Ignatius: awesome cheers
01:34 +znx: http://irssi.org/documentation/formats  <-- Ignatius
01:34 +Ignatius: even better :D
01:34 +Ignatius: thanks guys
01:34 +znx: nightfro`: thats the ugly solution to the nice theme solution :)
01:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v bastid_raZor]

01:40 +Ignatius: I'm having difficulties - namely incorporating these formats as part of a string - things are being printed literally as %r regardless of whether ot not they're in single or double quotes :/
01:41 +shabble: Ignatius: see http://shabble.github.com/irssi-scripts/docs/Irssi/UI/Theme.html
01:41 +znx: Ignatius: you need to use the theme method .. you cant just do printformat(...)
01:41 +znx: you need a theme_register + printformat
01:41 +shabble: also Irssi::parse_special might help
01:41 +znx: yeah true
01:41 +Ignatius: ahh, sweet
01:42 +Ignatius: srs PEBKAC going on here XD
01:42 +nightfro`: What does your print line look like?
01:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v m00]
01:43 +Ignatius: $server->command('msg '.$target.' this line is supposed to be coloured');
01:44 +The-Compiler: Ignatius: it so totally isn't. :p
01:44 +Ignatius: well obviously :P this is why I need your help :D
01:45 +Ignatius: your help will bring pretty colours to the world and it will be a much better place :)
01:46 +xand: pretty colours
01:47 +Bazerka:  /facestab
01:47 +Ignatius: yes, amazing :) now how do I get those into the above line of code? :P
01:48 +Ignatius: %r and \x03 and \003 don't work :(
01:48 +shabble: Ignatius: that's a totally different problem to standard irssi colours
01:48 +Ignatius: yes, but the script is being written specifically for irssi
01:51 +Ignatius: All I need to know, is what goes in that line, that will change the formatting of the text being sent to $target
01:51 +Ignatius: seems a simple enough request, but I can't seem to find the right answer :(
01:51 +shabble: /script exec Irssi::active_win->command("say \x033moo")
01:51 +shabble: see http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/colors.html
01:52 +Bazerka: you're using single quotes, so it's a literal string which will prevent \xXX and \XXX from working
01:52 +shabble: but replace their Ctrl-K with \x03
01:52 +shabble: and yes, you need double quotes for interpolation
01:52 +Ignatius: oh hell... I thought it was the other way
01:52 +Ignatius: face --> desk
01:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath_]
01:52 +shabble: 'foo' . 'bar' . chr(3) . '5moo' will also work
01:52 +shabble: but it's waaaay more effort
01:52 +Ignatius: yeah
01:52 +Ignatius: double quotes it is then
01:53 +Ignatius: it is *always* something simple with me >_>
01:53 +Ignatius: thanks for your help again guys :D
01:53 +Bazerka: and as you're using double quotes, you can put $target inside the string instead of using concatenation

01:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lofidellity]
01:58 +lofidellity: I have this recurring problem where irssi decides to prepend messages with a - or a + and actions are printed as -ACTION
01:58 +lofidellity: is that a known issue?
01:59 +Bazerka: that's freenode's identify capability
01:59 +Bazerka: it prepends messages with + or - depending if the sender is identified or not
01:59 +lofidellity: its not happening on freenode
02:00 +Bazerka: well, other networks may also use it
02:00 +lofidellity: the same user can type twice in a row the first time with a + in front of their message and the second with a -
02:00 +lofidellity: within seconds
02:00 +lofidellity: on a server with no authentication/nickserv etc
02:00 +Bazerka: so, either that's what the server is sending, or you've got a script messing with your incoming text
02:01 +lofidellity: could it be proxy?
02:01 +Bazerka: save a rawlog and check to see if the +/- are in there
02:01 +lofidellity: how do i save a rawlog?
02:01 +lofidellity: found it
02:01 +Bazerka:  /save rawlog some_filename
02:02 +Bazerka: re
02:02 +Bazerka:  /rawlog save some_filename
02:02 +Bazerka: even
02:04 +lofidellity: yes they +/- are still there in the rawlog
02:05 +Bazerka: then either the server is sending them, or if you're using a proxy/bnc, that's adding them
02:05 +lofidellity: im using the proxy module
02:06 +lofidellity: it usually takes a couple days before the issue comes up
02:06 +Bazerka: so you checked the rawlog for an irssi which is connecting via an external irssi-proxy?
02:07 +Bazerka: if so, then you need to check the rawlog on the irssi instace that's providing the proxy
02:07 +Bazerka: *instance
02:07 +lofidellity: no i checked the rawlog to the irssi that is directly connected
02:07 +lofidellity: er, the one that is providing the proxy
02:07 +Bazerka: so, it's nothing to do with irssi-proxy
02:08 +Bazerka: the rawlog for that irssi is showing what it's receiving from whatever it is connected to
02:08 +Bazerka: ie, the server
02:08 +lofidellity: so is there some command i could have possibly sent which would change the format of returned data?
02:09 +Bazerka: pass, I have no idea what ircd you're connected to

02:37 +nenolod: it has like 43754237573275237 0days
02:38 +nenolod: i mean that's almost as bad as using unreal 3.1
02:39 +lofidellity: Bazerka: you wouldnt happen to know how to turn off capab's would you? (im only hilighting you because you answer the original question)
02:42 +nenolod: CAPAB -identify-prefix
02:42 +nenolod: but dancer doesn't have it
02:42 +nenolod: we added it to hyperion
02:42 +Bazerka: er
02:42 +nenolod: we just kept IRCD=dancer for compatibility with scripts
02:42 +Bazerka: dancer certainly does have it
02:43 +nenolod: it does not
02:43 +nenolod: wait
02:43 +nenolod: actually, yeah it does
02:43 * Bazerka looks at the 1.0.32 changlelog
02:43 +Bazerka: *changelog
02:43 +nenolod: asuffield added a broken version of it to 1.0.32 which never got used anyway
02:44 +nenolod: freenode had, at that point, "fired" asuffield and replaced him with Geert for a few months (newircd)
02:44 +nenolod: then lilo put jilles and i in charge
02:45 +Bazerka: for context: lofidellity isn't talking about freenode
02:45 +nenolod: well, if there is a network on dancer anywhere else
02:45 +nenolod: they should really upgrade
02:45 +nenolod: because like i said, it has 2^1024 0days

04:06 +bremner: soundNICK: you might like the url or openurl scripts
04:06 +bremner: but they are not about clicking
04:06 +soundNICK: hmm.. well maybe later... there is no way to get URL to open with left click then ?
04:08 +bremner: as webvictim said, you can get some terminals to do that
04:08 +webvictim: what platform are you on?
04:08 +soundNICK: ah its about the terminal then
04:09 +soundNICK: not sure "platform"... this is irssi in a sakura terminal ?

12:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
12:43 +fender0107401: If I set "user_name=fender0107401", everything is OK.
12:44 +fender0107401: Why?
12:45 +bremner: because one nick is registered, the other not?
12:47 +fender0107401: fender is not registerd (at least by me).
12:49 +bremner: right, and #c doesn't like non-registered nicks
12:50 +Steve57: user_name isn't a nick, though. maybe they just prefer that it match your nick?
12:50 +fender0107401: I am sorry I didn't discribe it clearly. I mean I always be forwarded wo another channel.
12:50 +fender0107401: That channel is for the user that always join and exit some channel.
12:51 +tmr: Well yoy have been hopping in and out constantly.
12:52 +fender0107401: and the channel tell me I can run "/msg candide unbanme <channek>" to fix this problem.

19:27 * Babar had done that on epic4, but didn't restore it when switching to irssi
19:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v brez]
19:29 +tmr: Or do you mean collapse like irssi does with netsplits? That would require some kind of buffering and spewing them out when x time has gone or x quits has been bufferend, would be quite useless..
19:30 +CodeHelpMachine: Yeah like that, I was thinking more like it would 'overwrite' the line that was already printed
19:30 +CodeHelpMachine: So no buffering or timers
19:31 +tmr: Then go with what Babar said, create split and redirect all that in there. http://wouter.coekaerts.be/site/irssi/wclf
