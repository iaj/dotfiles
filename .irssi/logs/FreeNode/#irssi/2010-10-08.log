02:26 +f00li5h: i have bitlbeeitwitter and i'm wondering if i can have irssi learn to complete nicks for me
02:26 +billnye: that's a foolish thing to say
02:27 +f00li5h: billnye: get a job.
02:27 +billnye: :)
02:28 +billnye: f00li5h: do your followeds show up in the &bitlbee ?
02:28 +shabble: you could use trigger.pl to exec /completion something?
02:28 +f00li5h: see it doesn't work the other way... In5iTeFu11

02:33 +f00li5h: maybe i'll ask those #bitlbee critters
02:34 +whoever: need some help i have a window that dosn't let me change channles with alt+arrow and it is set to sticky, can i get some help
02:35 +billnye: whoever: make another window sticky too
02:35 +billnye: and see if that new window becomes arrowable
02:36 +whoever: billnye: do i have to exit irssi or can i just source the file
02:36 +Dirm: f00li5h: seen twirssi?
02:36 +billnye: whoever: "/win stick on" in the window
02:36 +f00li5h: Dirm: it's deprecated due to new-twitter, i think
02:36 +Dirm: oh
02:38 +whoever: billnye: /win stick on didn't do anything
02:42 +billnye: whoever: help me out... what do you mean by "didn't do"?

12:03  grosboulet: Hello
12:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mingdao]
12:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mroconnor]
12:04  grosboulet: How can I define charset for each network ? (some with utf-8, another with iso)
12:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v oye]
12:09 +Bazerka:  /help recode
12:09 +ds187: grosboulet: perhaps you could set the terminal toi utf8 an then set recode_fallback to the iso-charset you want
12:09 +ds187: but tis just a guess :-)
12:09 +Bazerka: you can specify a charset per target
12:11  grosboulet: with recode ?
12:14 +tmr: /help recode
12:14 +ds187: oh, recode seems nice....didn't knew that one
12:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mingdao]
12:15 +mingdao: I have tried this twice before, and when I /quit and the launch irssi again, all the networks are changed. What have I done wrong? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/272632/
12:15 +Bazerka: you forgot to /save ?
12:16 +mingdao: no, I did /save and that post shows it was saved
12:16 +mingdao: and still see it scrolling up in <status>
12:16 +Bazerka: what do you mean all the networks have changed?
12:17 +mingdao: I have removed the networks I don't want
12:17 +mingdao: and attempted to add FreeNode using http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c3
12:17 +mingdao: this is the 3rd time
12:17 +mingdao: if I /quit irssi, then launch it again, those networks are all back
12:18 +mingdao: and my channels weren't joined, either
12:18 +mingdao: I did the joining, layout save, save ...
12:18 +tmr: Did you remove servers too?
12:18 +mingdao: no tmr
12:18 +Bazerka: did you add the channels with channel add?
12:18 +Bazerka: joining and saving isn't enough
12:18 +mingdao: yes I added the channels with channel add
12:18 +ds187: mingdao: did you put the channels into autojoin_at_startup mode?
12:19 +Bazerka: with -auto ?
12:19 +mingdao: like this: /CHANNEL ADD -auto #irssi FreeNode
12:19 +mingdao: like that ^^
12:19 +ds187: that looks fine
12:19 +mingdao: I follwed the startup guide
12:19 +mingdao: almost copied and pasted
12:19 +tmr: Just guessing here, but i possible irssi adds those networks because there are servers assiciated with 'em.
12:19 +Bazerka: if you did all that and it reverted on starting irssi, it sounds like either a) the config isn't actually getting written to the file or b) irssi's pulling in config from elsewhere
12:19 +mingdao: never could get my color junk out of my logs so I decided to start over with a fresh config
12:20 +mingdao: what about removing servers?
12:20 * tmr yells about crappy phone keyboards..
12:20 +mingdao: when I issue /server it outputs: 18:20:23 ::: freenode: irc.freenode.net:6666 ()
12:21 +mingdao: tmr: I feel your pain ... love my iPhone but ...
12:21 +mingdao: and /network outputs:  18:21:12 OFTC: max_kicks: 1, max_msgs: 3, max_whois: 30
12:21 +mingdao: 18:21:12 FreeNode: autosendcmd: /^msg nickserv ident pass;wait 2000
12:21 +tmr: Never seen iPhone with a keyboard...
12:21 +mingdao: me neither
12:21 +mingdao: but it's not fun to type on nonetheless
12:22 +tmr: Yeah.
12:22 +mingdao: I STILL feel your pain
12:22 +mingdao: autocomplete on the phone is good/bad
12:22 +mingdao: I don't seem to have any servers that I need to remove do I?
12:23  grosboulet: tmr: how can I specify a tag ? /recode add freenode utf-8 does not work
12:23 +mingdao: will quit and see what happens
12:24 +tmr: grosboulet, I dont know if that's possible.

14:24 +ahf: link plox
14:25 +mingdao: my logs don't have funky colors now
14:25 +mingdao: but I still can not make the channels autojoin ... though they were before
14:25 +ds187: mingdao: take a look into your config file before and after saving it....and see what it shows.......also take a look at the last edit-timestamp
14:25 +mingdao: ds187: 2010-10-08 20:23 config
14:26 +mingdao: 20:25:56 <+mingdao> ds187: 2010-10-08 20:23 config
14:26 +mingdao: 3 minutes past
14:27 +ds187: i just wanted to make sure, that when you /save something, that he really saves it to your ~/.irssi/config and not just pretending it
14:27 +ds187: 14:27 here, btw :-)
14:27 +mingdao: ds187: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/272657/
14:28 +grawity: mingdao: so you have a 'freenode' network, and a '##kernel' channel... But you don't have any Freenode servers in there.
14:29 +mingdao: ds187: I'm at a loss ... and appreciated the patience
14:29 +mingdao: grawity: must I have a FreeNode server?
14:29 +grawity: I guess it depends on how you connect.
14:29 +grawity: What command do you use to go to Freenode
14:30 +Bazerka: ahf: http://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/master/history-search/rl_history_search.pl
14:30 +Bazerka: ahf: it also needs http://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/raw/master/prompt_info/prompt_info.pl
14:30 +mingdao: this is how: irssi -c irc.freenode.net -p 6666 -n mingdao -w <passwd>
14:30 +grawity: mingdao: Okay, you _do_ need to add a Freenode server to the config
14:31 +grawity: mingdao: /server add -net freenode chat.freenode.net 6666 <passwd>
14:31 +Bazerka: specifically, the one you're passing on the command line
14:31 +mingdao: grawity: can I just use the one I'm presently one? Or should I try one "close" to me?
14:31 +grawity: mingdao: It doesn't matter which you use.
14:31 +grawity: mingdao: Nobody stops you from adding the same "irc.freenode.net".
14:31 +mingdao: grawity: the round robin still works
14:31 +grawity: *facepalm*
14:32 +mingdao: why?
14:32 +grawity: When you do "irssi -c irc.freenode.net", it doesn't know that it is the same 'freenode' as listed in
14:32 +grawity: { name = "##kernel"; chatnet = "freenode"; autojoin = "yes"; }
14:36 --- _Kraftwerk is now known as Kraftwerk
14:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v benjilepton]
14:38 +ahf: Bazerka: very nice, indeed
14:39 +Bazerka: saves me having to sb search for commands in service windows now \o/
14:39 +mingdao: grawity: so is this correct so far:  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/272661/
14:39 +ahf: Bazerka: ;)
14:39 +grawity: mingdao: Technically yes -- but you can also add autoconnect = "yes";
14:40 +grawity: mingdao: (or /server add ... -auto ...)
14:40 +Bazerka: especially given how long our ad-hoc queries can be for our search service
14:40 +Bazerka: (pita to retype them)
14:40 +grawity: mingdao: Also, this is unrelated, but I recommend enabling SSL (port=7070 use_ssl=yes ssl_verify=yes)
14:41 +mingdao: grawity: will do that also, thanks
14:41 +mingdao: grawity: is this correct:    /server add -auto -net freenode chat.freenode.net 6666 <passwd>
14:42 +grawity: mingdao: Yes.
14:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dongkc]
14:42 +tmr: Is -net really valid?
14:43 +grawity: irssi accepts abbreviated options
14:43 * grawity wouldn't suggest -net if he hadn't been using it for months.
14:43 +tmr: Ah.
14:44 +mingdao: grawity: is the command for automatically joining channels:  /CHANNEL ADD -auto #irssi freenode
14:44 +tmr: I will forget this awesome info and continue tab completing full options :)
14:44 +grawity: mingdao: Yes.
14:46 +mingdao: grawity: the only think so far that is different than before is adding the server
14:46 +Zed`: Bazerka: is there a newer version of history search? (which I love LOVE L O V E, BTW)
14:46 +mingdao: grawity: now, also, my logs are in the proper place and look correct
14:47 +grawity: mingdao: which is exactly what you were missing
14:47 +mingdao: grawity: thanks for your patience ... one more thing
14:47 +grawity: (irssi doesn't magically know that "irc.freenode.net" belong to the Freenode network; you had to tell it that with /server add)
14:47 +mingdao: grawity: thanks ... I stumbled over that connect line or trying to put it in the config
14:48 +mingdao: grawity: when freenode netsplits or whatever happens and I come back as mingdao_ ... is there something to do for that?
14:49 +mingdao: so that I'm not having to release mingdao blah
14:50 +grawity: Things like that are done during a netsplit to ensure that nobody can use your nick, if NickServ happens to be on the other half of network.
14:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Evil_]
14:52 +Bazerka: Zed`: I'm using the one from shabble's repo, so I guess that's the latest
14:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v oye]
14:56 +mingdao: grawity: to use SSL is this correct:   irssi -c irc.freenode.net port=7070 use_ssl=yes ssl_verify=yes -n mingdao -w <passswd>
14:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip]
15:00 +grawity: No.
15:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v petrux]
15:00 +grawity: mingdao: I thought we already agreed to stop using 'irssi -c' and put the server settings to config instead?
15:00 +Zed`: Bazerka: cool
15:01 +mingdao: grawity: I didn't get the part about not using "irssi -c"
15:01 +mingdao: grawity: so with it setup properly just "irssi" ?
15:01 +grawity: mingdao: yes
15:01 +grawity: mingdao: You also get the advantage of your password not being visible to everyone who runs 'ps' :)
15:02 +grawity: /server add -net freenode -auto -ssl -ssl_verify chat.freenode.net 7070 <passwd>
15:02 +grawity: ("irc.freenode.net" is a redirect to "chat.freenode.net"; both work exactly the same way)
15:02 +mingdao: grawity: everyone who runs ps?
15:03 +grawity: ps -ef
15:03 +grawity: Well, everyone on the system irssi is on.
15:03 +mingdao: no worries ... only me
15:03 +mingdao: but it's not impervious to an attack I'm sure
15:05 +mingdao: grawity: thanks for your patient help ... moff to test it
15:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mingdao]
15:08 +mingdao: grawity: thanks ... and ps shows: mingdao  10280  2628  0 21:05 pts/1    00:00:00 irssi
15:08 +mingdao: my logs are in the right place, without that messed up output from color ... all's right with the world of my little server ;)
