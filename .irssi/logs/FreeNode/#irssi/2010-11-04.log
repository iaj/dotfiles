09:50 +dhruvasagar: how do I move to a channel window by channel name ?
09:52 +Babar: use /window goto
09:53 +Steve57:  /window goto #channel
09:53 +Babar: so, bind /w to /window goto, and use /w #channel
09:53 +Babar: doesn't work that well when you've got several channels with the same name accross networks
09:53 +jayne: is there any way for a script to open a new curses "pop-up" on top of (or within) an existing window?
09:57 +dhruvasagar: Hi when I do /script install <scriptname> Scriptassist says the sacript name and says it was not installed, can someone please help ?
09:58 +dhruvasagar: Babar: thanks
09:58 +dhruvasagar: Steve57: thanks
09:58 +dhruvasagar: Steve57: can you also help with the scriptassist problem ?
10:00 +dhruvasagar: Babar: ?
10:03 +jink: dhruvasagar: Shouldn't that be /scriptassist install <scriptname> ?
10:03 +dhruvasagar: jink: it is the same
10:04 +dhruvasagar: jink: and even if I do /scriptassist install it says not installed

13:51 +Zed`: bjorn_: there was a vim script
13:51 +Zed`: might have to hang out a bit till more folk wake up
13:51 +tmr: bjorn_, /join #irssi_vim, see /topic
13:52 +bjorn_: thats okay for me :) will try google a second time then and also try the channel meanwhile.
13:54 +Zed`: shabble's gits seem to be missing
13:55 +Zed`: wow they got serious about vim mode I see :)
13:55 +bjorn_: thanks Zed`. Thant was all I needed..
13:55 +bjorn_: ;)
13:55 +Zed`: np, its a cool project
13:56 +Zed`: history_serach.pl is pretty awesome too https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/
13:56 +Zed`: use it every day
13:56 +Zed`: scrolled reminder, too
13:57 +Zed`: I should start getting a commission from shabble
13:57 +bjorn_: ;)
13:57 +bjorn_: I just copy the script to .irssi to make it work?

14:07 +dn4: where the password goes to /identify
14:08 +tmr: What is UN/PW?
14:08 +cyraxx: username/password i'd guess
14:10 +dn4: right
14:10 +dn4: I am looking at the server command here
14:10 +dn4: http://static.quadpoint.org/irssi-docs/help-full.html#SERVER
14:11 +dn4: what would the command look like?
14:11 +vizz: iirc it depends on the network, which you want to join
14:14 +dn4: hmm getting a login failed
14:14 +tmr: I don't know what that web page has, but help says pass comes after port. On freenode format would be account:password.
14:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]

14:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]

15:13 +Zed`: just re-issue the add command with the parameters you need
15:13 +Zed`: and upgrade to .15
15:13 +Zed`: :)
15:13 +crazed: so i need .15 for that
15:13 +crazed: damn
15:14 +Zed`: no
15:14 +Zed`: ssl is in eariler versions
15:14 +Zed`: tho I am not sure about .11
15:14 +Zed`: but there are a LOT of bug fixes since 11
15:15 +crazed: ssl is definitely supported, it's just the network add command doesn't have it
15:16 +crazed: i'm using a private irc server at work that uses ssl, but can't really upgrade either at this time

15:31 +miguel000: How can i set my nickname for a network and automatically identify via nickserv?
15:31 +miguel000: I see the example in the HOWTO /NETWORK ADD -autosendcmd "/^msg nickserv ident pass;wait 2000" OFTC
15:31 +miguel000: but why do i have to wait 20000?
15:32 +miguel000: 2000
15:32 +miguel000: also I do not understand waht the ^ is
15:32 +jink: Some channels require you are identified before you can join.  This makes sure it works.
15:32 +MinceR: because irssi will wait for the autosendcmd to complete before attempting to autojoin
15:32 +lestat: because otherwise you might join some channel before your hostmask is setup
15:32 +jink: /^msg doesn't op a new query window.
15:32 +jink: open, even.
15:33 +miguel000: allright. and wait 2000 is an irssi command? or part of irc?
15:33 +MinceR: it's an irssi command
15:33 +miguel000: allright thx
15:34 +miguel000: I also assume the ^ is part of irssi, right?
15:35 +yitz_: The ^ hides output
15:35 +lestat: miguel000: if you remove the ^, you'll have a new window opened for the /msg
15:36 +miguel000: i understand that, but wonder if its part of the irc protocoll or special to irssi
15:36 +jink: irssi
15:36 +miguel000: nice
15:38 +miguel000: one more thing I want is to mark some of my networks to be joined automatically on irssi startup. How do I accomplish that?
15:38 +billnye: miguel000: almost everything is going to be "part of irssi" not part of the protocol, but much of irssi's syntax and conventions are common to the base of other IRC clients as well
15:38 +billnye: miguel000: keep reading the startup howto.
15:38 +miguel000: :)
15:43 +miguel000: I'm afraid that I already did add the server but forgot to set -auto

17:09 +yitz_: Yeah
17:10 +yitz_: Could it be reading/getting the binding from some other source?

17:13 +billnye: anything else with a 5 in it from /bind ?
17:13 +yitz_: meta-5[0-9]
17:14 +Bazerka: ghost in the shell
17:14 +yitz_: I got meta-{01..69} bound but of {0..9} only meta-5 seems to get bound

17:28 +ferret: yitz_: exact line from /bind output please
17:29 +ferret: +s
17:29 +ferret: pastebin ;p

17:30 +ferret: yitz_: I bound all the default meta-blahs to nothing, I think
17:30 +ferret: /bind meta-q nothing

17:30 +ferret: hmm, actually, only did that for the top qwerty row.  Anyway, that might work.
17:32 +yitz_: Hrm. Odd. When I reload, it re-binds meta-5. Actually, all meta-[0-9]. But all the other binds from 01 to 69 work without triggering the single-digit bind with the exception of the 5. I'll try binding to nothing
17:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v izibi]
17:37 +yitz_: Nope. Didn't help. The meta-5 captures before meta-5[0-9] ever with meta-5 bound to nothing. The other multi-digit binds capture before the single digit
17:38 +ferret: dd
17:38 +ferret: odd
17:38 +yitz_: binds: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/286105/
17:39 +ferret: maybe the order of the lines in the file makes a difference?
17:39 +ferret: ohhh, you have them like that
17:40 +ferret: I used to have them like that, but I had the same problems you're having
17:40 +ferret: try instead: meta-1-meta-6
17:42 +yitz_: Heh. That fixes it, but doesn't explain it...
17:43 +Bazerka: meta-XY != meta-Xmeta-Y
17:43 +ferret: you have to hold down the meta key for both
17:44 +yitz_: Yeah. Slight difference. I prefer the first but can survive with either
17:53 +coekie: ealexp: your mentioning of  http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=754 yesterday made me look at it again. now I just noticed I never replied there
17:54 +coekie: "<ealexp> but no one cares" => I don't care enough to try to fix it myself no. I do still care enough to try to get someone else to do it ;)
