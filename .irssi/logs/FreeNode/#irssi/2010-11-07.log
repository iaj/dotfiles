23:32 +lamah: how can i make a auto-identify to freenode?
23:32 +lamah: with irssi 0.8.15?
23:33 +lamah: by nick services?
23:33 +Death4Life: put 'account:password' as server password
23:34 +grawity: or set up a SASL script
23:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lamah]
23:36 +lamah: Death4Life: how? account:password?
23:38 +lamah: or account: password ?
23:38 +lamah: account :password
23:38 +grawity: account:password
23:39 +lamah: not works
23:39 +ds187: i think at freenode a password is enough......i don't provide my username, just nickserv password as serverpassword and it works
23:40 +grawity: Well, technically yes.
23:40 +grawity: But not when you connect as "ds187_" or...
23:41 +ds187: grawity: hmm, never done that :-)

23:44 +lamah: Death4Life: i have in .bashrc alias 'irssi -c irc.freenode.net' but when i set it to 'irssi -c irc.freenodenet lamah:password' not works ?
23:44 +Death4Life: euhm
23:44 +lamah: :)))))
23:44 +Remco: lamah: /help network followed by /help server and /help channel
23:44 +Death4Life:   -w, --password=PASSWORD     Autoconnect password
23:45 +Remco: Or that
23:45 * Remco very much prefers the config way
23:45 +Death4Life: me too :P
23:47 +Remco: In his case, I'd suggest man irssi
23:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lamah]
23:48 +lamah: yes yes -w
23:48 +Remco: Also: man irssi
23:48 +ds187: lamah: have you ever thought about using the config? :-)
23:48 +lamah: ds187: no show me the way:)
23:48 +Remco: [23:44] <+Remco> lamah: /help network followed by /help server and /help channel
23:49 +lamah: ds187: for crypting
23:49 +ds187: read the startup howto :-)
23:49 +Remco: Link to startup howto is in the topic
23:49 +lamah: ds187: hm... why i have a manually created a config file:)... very good
23:49 +lamah: ds187: '.config'
23:50 +ds187: lamah: the default is in ~/.irssi/config
23:50 +lamah: ds187: u mean autoidentify option from irssi for identify to nick services... i know these options but not works i think
23:51 +lamah: ds187: yep
23:51 +ds187: you could also define serverpassword in config, no problem with that
23:52 +lamah: Remco: ok
23:52 +ds187: my only thought is, if you'd like to start programms via your .bashrc, than just start the programm there, but do the configuration elsewhere
23:53 +imMute: ...
23:53 +lamah: ds187: i know, you are a right
