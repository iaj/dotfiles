00:43 +CIA-55: coekie * r5193 /webssi/trunk/src/main/perl/ (. webssi.pl):
00:43 +CIA-55: Only build text events right before sending a response. To do that we remember for each session which windows are dirty.
00:43 +CIA-55: That avoids building up a huge event queue when a client disconnects but the session hasn't expired yet.
00:43 +CIA-55: And at the same time, it avoid the execute_later for every line being printed, which created a big @execute_queue full of memory-hungry closures.
00:43 +CIA-55: This should significantly reduce memory consumption.
