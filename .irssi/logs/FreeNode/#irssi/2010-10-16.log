13:57 +brez_: omgh!
13:57 +brez_: it's still up!
13:57 +brez_: /bin/sh: uptime: command not found
13:58 +arachnist: lol
13:59 +shabble: we need an /exec -maybe, that prints it locally, and only sends to the server if you're happy with it :p
14:01 +tmr: [ OK ]  [ Cancel ]
14:02 +cromag: [ BEAM ME UP SCOTTIE ]
14:02 +shabble: abort, retry, fail
14:03 +webvictim: i always wanted the "ignore" option in that list
14:03 +webvictim: and it rarely appeared :(
14:03 +webvictim: whenever i saw it, it was invariably something fatal
14:03 +tmr: Lets not speak about aborts or religious zealots will attack.
14:03 +shabble: tmr: software has performed an illegal operation?
14:03 +webvictim: heh
14:04 +Bazerka: No keyboard found, press F1 to continue!
14:06 +cromag: heh
14:06 +cromag: thats a goodone
14:07 +shabble: I made a little dongle with an AT keyboard connector and  PIC microcontorller to simulate spamming F1 once
14:07 +shabble: stupid bioses
14:07 +arachnist: most bioses have an option to ignore lack of keyboard
14:08 +shabble: yeah, this one didn't
14:08 +shabble: Bazerka: hey
14:09 * Bazerka looks around
14:09 +Bazerka: who, me?
14:09 +shabble: no, that other guy
14:09 +Bazerka: phew
14:09 +shabble: but maybe you can help instead
14:10 +shabble: do you know if it's possible to determine which windows are currently visible? (in hte case of splits, active_win() isn't enough)
14:10 +Bazerka: off the top of my head, I have no idea - I don't (and never have) used splits
14:11 +shabble: me neither, but I'm attemping some weird and wonderful scripting which needs to know
14:14 +Bazerka: mm
14:14 +shabble: there's nothing obvious in the Window or View object
14:15 +Bazerka: you may need to walk the list of windows and check for active
14:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cloq]
14:17 +Bazerka: 'active' will reference the window item in focus
14:18 +shabble: yeah, but is there a 'visible' for htings that are shown but not active?
14:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lost_soul]
14:19 +MinceR: webvictim: iirc ndos/4dos always put the Ignore option in
14:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
14:20 +Bazerka: shabble: hmm?
14:20 +Bazerka: if you have split windows, the currently shown "window" in each split will have an active key
14:20 +Bazerka: that's what you mean by visible, yes?
14:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rvsjoen]
14:22 +Bazerka: eg, if I have #chan1 (display), #chan2, #chan3 in windows in split 1, and #chan4, #chan5 (displayed), #chan6 in split 2 - only #chan1 and #chan5 will be active
14:22 +shabble: as in: /se for (Irssi::windows) { print $_->{refnum}. " " . $_->{active} } ?
14:23 +shabble: because that doesn't work - there is no ->{active} entry afaict.
14:24 +Bazerka: hmm, perhaps not
14:24 +Bazerka: that does work, but not how I thought
14:24 +shabble: there's get_active_name, which I guess returns the windowitem, but I suspect all windows will ahve an active item, visible or not
14:25 +Bazerka: yeah, rather than which window is the "active window" in a split
14:25 +Bazerka: hmrmph
14:30 +Bazerka: yeah, thinking about it that makes pefect sense
14:33 +shabble: yeah, it's just not helpful in this context :)
14:36 +Bazerka: so what is needed is a hidden or not property
14:37 +shabble: yeah
14:37 +shabble: or even better, some access into the layout stuff in mainwindow
14:40 +shabble: at least, I think layout is what saves/stores split info
14:41 +Bazerka: but in the context of what's currently available, I don't know of a way to get the info you need
14:42 +shabble: yeah, I might have to give up on it for now
14:42 +shabble: or just make it for people without splits
14:43 +Bazerka: as what you need is a level above ::Window
14:44 +Bazerka: and isn't exposed
14:44 +shabble: yeah
14:44 +Bazerka: (ie, the MAIN_WINDOW_RECs)
14:45 +shabble: do you knwo where that stuff happens? I think it's mainwindows{-layout,}.c
14:47 +shabble: I'll think about writing a patch, but last time I tried to create a whole new .xs and supporting faff, I couldn't get the makefile to pick it up
14:48 +Bazerka: with just glancing at the code, what is probably of interest is the mainwindows GSList in mainwindows.h
14:48 +Bazerka: unless I'm misinterpreting what main windows are (this is code I'm not familiar with)
14:49 +shabble: ok, I'll have a proper read through and see what goes where
14:49 +shabble: thanks for looking :)
