13:43 +Rhonda: ojii2: You mean like top posting in emails? yuck! That's against the natural reading order.
13:43 +Death4Life: ojii2: turn your screen upside down? other then that, no idea
13:43 +ojii2: lol
13:44 +ojii2: well let's say you have a screen vertical, it's easier to look for new stuff at the top than the bottom (depending on how you set it up of course)
13:44 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 102 seconds
13:44 +Rhonda: Use trackbar script
13:45 +ojii2: not really what i'm looking for
13:45 +pksadiq: does anybody know how to follow a user name in a channel, that is I want to make the statements to be bold for the questions asked by a perticular person, olso the answers said to him
13:45 +ojii2: i basically really just want the order of the messages to be "reverse"
13:46 +tmr: Mirror on top of monitor in 45 degree angle?
13:47 +ojii2: tmr really hard to read...

13:53 +Rhonda: pksadiq: You could set two /hilight - one for the nick, and one for the pattern nick: at the start of a line

14:05 +fujisano: ./part command doesn't work for a query
14:05 +Rhonda: then /unquery.  Or /window close

19:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Josay]
19:04 +FauxFaux: Actually, on that topic, is it possible to get /lastlog to work on those windows?  I guess you need to do something other than $window->print.
19:04 +FauxFaux: ..or maybe change MSGLEVEL to public or something.
19:05 * FauxFaux shall try next time he's not busy reading said window.
19:05 +yitz_: FauxFaux: Yeah. Just change the print's level
19:05 +yitz_: I'm gonna reuse my window blacklist I got set up for ack.pl I think to filter a bit
19:06 +yitz_: Or add a allwin_filter list

20:15 +simon__: hello. Is there a script like nickcolor that colorizes the message instead of the nick?
20:16 +FauxFaux: Based on what algorithm..?
