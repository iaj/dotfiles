01:34 +tsp: How difficult would it be to list hilights first in the act: list?
01:34 +tsp: just a thought
01:38 +Bazerka: chanact.pl does that
01:39 +Bazerka:  /set actlist_sort level should also do it
01:39 +bburhans: tsp: /set actlist_sort level
01:39 +bburhans: I use it :)
01:44 +tsp: will that work with ack.pl?
01:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v f1st]
01:45 +bburhans: I am unfamiliar with ack.pl
01:45 +bburhans: technically a script can override pretty much everything, so that depends on the script.
01:46 * tsp nods
01:46 +billnye: tsp: ack.pl "unties" the [Act: ] priority from the jump-to-activity priority
01:46 +billnye: so yes.
01:46 +tsp: it did, cool
01:47 --- _Lewellyn is now known as lewellyn
01:47 +Bazerka: billnye: those aren't tied anyways
01:48 +Bazerka: given that you can actlist_sort and active_window_ignore_refnum
01:48 +Bazerka: loosely coupled perhaps
01:50 +billnye: Bazerka: perhaps they've "come untied" since I check last :)
01:50 +Bazerka: yeah, the latter setting is fairly new
01:50 +billnye: ON just defaults to--what? the same as Act:?
01:51 +billnye: or "the same as, minus refnum"?
01:51 +billnye: , rather"?

02:25 +simcop2387: how would i setup a command to get run every couple of minutes? (specifically i want to send a message to a channel)
02:25 +Bazerka_: use something like cron.pl or timer.pl
02:26 +simcop2387: thanks i'll look at them
02:26 +Bazerka_: I'd recommend cron.pl over timer.pl
02:29 +shabble: I wonder if /exec -o watch -n 60 echo moo would work? :)
02:31 +simcop2387: hmm
02:31 +simcop2387: wheres one of my throw away channels...
02:32 +shabble: aww, it needs a tty I think
02:34 --- bikcmp is now known as bikcmp_
02:34 --- bikcmp_ is now known as bikcmp
02:34 +simcop2387: watch doesn't work BUT; while(/bin/true); do echo "..."; sleep 60; done works
02:34 +shabble: heh, who needs those pesky scripts :p
02:35 +simcop2387: shabble: i just need to do this for a little bit to show a bunch of idiots on a channel how to do something regularly, just a short simple message to inform them
02:37 +shabble: /script exec -permanent Irssi::timeout_add 60 * 1000, sub { Irssi::command "msg #foo something"; } # an alternative
02:38 +simcop2387: neat
02:39 +simcop2387: its funny how well "monkey see, monkey do" works on irc though
02:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v happyface]
02:44 +Bazerka_: I'd rather use a script than spawn a kludgy shell process, but that's just me :)
02:47 +shabble: I've been messing with /script exec (-permanent) quite a bit recently.
02:48 +shabble: it'd be nice if the functions in the Irssi:: namespace were imported by default.
02:48 +shabble: I wonder how hard that would be to hack
02:49 +Bazerka_: they are
02:49 --- Bazerka_ is now known as Bazerka
02:50 +shabble: really?
02:51 +shabble: Thu.01:50:33 Undefined subroutine &Irssi::Script::data1::command called at (eval 328033) line 1.
02:52 +Bazerka: oh, that kind of import - nasty namespace pollution - no thank you :)
02:52 +shabble: well, for one-liners, it'd be more useful than not
02:52 +shabble: not for actual scripts
02:53 +Bazerka: you do it for one, you do it for all
02:53 +shabble: meh, there's no way to distinguish?
02:53 +Bazerka: it would require some re-working to do it
02:53 +Bazerka: afaik
02:55 +simcop2387: ought to be possible in theory
02:55 +Bazerka: anything is possible in theory, given enough code modifications :)
02:55 +shabble: I'm not sure where the magic between the xs stuff and Irssi.pm actually happens
02:55 +shabble: I might ahve a poke sometime
02:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v xrogaan]
02:59 +xrogaan: mmh
03:10 +shabble: is there an irssi git mirror anywhere that follows the main svn?
03:15 +Bazerka: git://git.irssi.org/irssi
03:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v genjix]
03:15 +genjix: hey :p
03:16 +shabble: I'm sure I remember some fancy webapp thing that would let you bounce around function tags an annotate bits of code
03:16 +shabble: I thought github did it, but I can't seem to find it now
03:16 +genjix: can anyone tell me how to do coloured text in irssi?... i need the colour codes for my bot
03:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v happyface]
03:16 +genjix: %G{hello} doesn't work
03:16 +shabble: genjix: C-c<num>[,<num>]
03:17 +shabble: assuming you mean in actual messages
03:17 +genjix: aha thank you ;)
03:17 +genjix: c1
03:17 +genjix: hello
03:17 +genjix: nice!
03:17 +shabble: meep
03:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v furtardo]
03:18 +shabble: the 'mirc_color_popup' script is quite handy
03:19 +genjix: i guess colour codes in python are like \x03,45
03:19 +genjix: fyi
03:19 +shabble: yeah, pretty much
03:19 +Bazerka: not quite
03:20 +Bazerka: you forgot the leading  \x03
03:20 +genjix: no?
03:20 +genjix: so "\x03\x03,45hello"?
03:20 +Bazerka: well, no :)
03:20 +shabble: "\x03" . $foreground . ',' . $background . $msg
03:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cjohnston]
03:21 +Bazerka:  \x03 starts the colour sequence, then it's two digit foreground with optional ( comma followed by two digit background)
03:21 +Bazerka: and close the coloured sequence with another \x03
03:21 +genjix: ok thanks
03:22 +genjix: lets try this :p
03:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v colorbot]
03:22 +colorbot: hello friend =)
03:22 +genjix: i did
03:23 +Bazerka: pass, I have colorstripping enabled :)
03:23 +genjix: "\x0304hello friend =)\x03
03:23 +shabble: I have colours, and I didn't see it
03:23 +genjix: me neither
03:23 +genjix: maybe 04 isn't a colour code
03:23 +shabble: try just 4
03:23 +Bazerka: 04 certainly is :)
03:24 +shabble: moo?
03:24 +shabble: yep, that does work
03:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cjohnston]
03:25 +genjix: im writing a bot for this http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/4347/screenec.png
03:25 +Bazerka: the channel has +c set
03:25 +genjix: irc makes it easy to debug a server
03:25 +Bazerka: which filters colours
03:26 +shabble: Bazerka: ah, own messages appear coloured because they're not server processed. Hmm
03:26 +shabble: try in a test channel
03:27 +shabble: has it been +c for long? I'm sure I remember some rainbow spam a while back :)
03:27 +genjix: shabble: am i coloured?
03:27 +shabble: genjix: no
03:27 +genjix: ahaaa ok
03:27 +shabble: join #colourtest and try again
03:27 +Bazerka: shabble: that was ansi codes as it bypassed my colourstripping too
03:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v colorbot]
03:28 +colorbot: hello friend =)
03:28 +genjix: oops
03:28 +Bazerka: fail :)
03:28 +genjix: :p
03:28 +genjix: nice! it works. tyty

03:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Steve57]
03:29 * Bazerka facestabs ferret 
03:30 +ferret: :D
03:30 +genjix: all text on irc  should look like that
03:30 +Bazerka: is that standard ansi, ferret ?
03:30 +ferret: it's a secret
03:31 +Bazerka: if so, +c is slightly broken, as it should filter ansi too
03:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mquin]
03:32 +Steve57: i thought all IRC should be like that video clip on the irssi home page :P

03:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v catsup]
03:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v deryni]
03:35 +Bazerka: mmm, so not ansi
03:38 +genjix: oh lol *that* video
03:38 +genjix: that show's hilarious
03:38 +Steve57: lol, yeah genjix. "hackers use it" or whatever
03:39 +genjix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU
03:39 +Steve57: ;)
03:40 +shabble: does [7mthis[0m work?
03:40 +Bazerka: nope
03:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Sedated]
03:41 +Bazerka: he didn't send ansi, it was ^Dxy
03:41 +Steve57: aren't irssi's colors converted to ansi?
03:41 +Bazerka: not familiar with whatever that mechanism is
03:41 +Steve57: oh. n/m
03:42 +shabble: 0x4 as an escape?
03:42 +shabble: not seen that before either
03:43 +Steve57: now i'm curious
03:44 +Bazerka: http://pastebin.com/ZDci1gRG
03:46 +Steve57: a query?
03:47 +Bazerka: hmm?
03:48 +Bazerka: a query is PRIVMSG <nick>
03:48 +Bazerka: channel text is PRIVMSG <channel>
03:48 +Steve57: oh! ok. live and learn. :)
03:49 +shabble: the irc spec was written by scandinavians, probably on Massive Drugs
03:49 +Steve57: lol
03:49 +shabble: that generally explains everything :)
03:49 +Bazerka: finns and beer ;)
03:50 +shabble: does the server in general strip ansi codes (without +c or equiv)?
03:50 +Bazerka: nope
03:50 +Bazerka: it's just a sequence of bytes to the server
03:51 +Bazerka: it only takes on significance if +c is set
03:56 +shabble: it seems to disallow certain \e terminal control sequences,
03:56 +shabble: at least on the server I'm messing with, even without +c
03:57 +Bazerka: oh, you're talking about the full set of ansi - I assumed you just mean the colour controls
03:58 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fender0107401]
03:59 +shabble: yeah, I was wondering if you could send a \e[?2J or something :)
04:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Tam^]
04:06 +shabble: something is intercepting it though
04:06 +shabble: and yet, \e[1m for bold is ok.
04:10 +Bazerka: --> | :Bazerka!bazerka@255.255.255.255 PRIVMSG #beardz :\05[?2J
04:10 +Bazerka: doesn't get filtered here
04:12 +shabble: hmm, let me fire up a rawlog and see what I'm getting
04:14 +Bazerka: [?2J
04:15 +Bazerka: oh
04:15 +Bazerka: silly me
04:16 +Bazerka: using \05 instead of \33
04:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisBoy]
04:16 +shabble: yeah, it's making it into the rawlog
04:16 +shabble: but irssi at the other end is ignoring it
04:25 +shabble: it makes it all the way through to the 'message public' signal param
04:25 +shabble: I guess the rendering bits somewhere must realise and kill it
04:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v deckard]
04:32 +deckard: hey anyone around?  trying to setup SSL connect. to freenode using svn irssi; and im having a cert issue
04:32 +genjix: got the keycodes producing nice coloured debug output now :)
04:33 * Bazerka points deckard at the topic

05:52 +RobotCaleb: hi. How do I escape a dollar sign in a -autosendcmd ?
05:54 +yitz_: $$ I think
05:54 +yitz_: If that fails, try \$
05:54 +RobotCaleb: thanks. I tried \$ but that failed. I'll give the other a shot
05:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v RobotCaleb]
05:56 +RobotCaleb: that worked. Thanks a lot!
05:57 +drazak: so I made an alias, ta, for appending to a topic, it's eval topic $0- | $topic
05:57 +drazak: but when there's a ; in either the origial topic of what I'm adding, it doesn't escape it, and it evaluates it
05:57 +drazak: any way to fix this?
06:17 +Bazerka: yeah, don't use an alias and use tab completion instead
06:17 +Bazerka:  /topic<space><space><tab>
06:17 +Bazerka: will tab complete the current topic
06:18 +Dirm: or /t<space><tab> :P
06:18 +Bazerka: handy - wasn't aware of that
06:20 +Bazerka: alternatively, eval the alias itself
06:21 +Bazerka: hmm, nm that
06:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v JoeMaverickSett]
06:21 +Bazerka: oh, it does actually work
06:21 +Dirm: I use /bind ^T insert_text /topic $C $topic
06:22 +Bazerka:  /alias ta topic $topic | $0-
06:22 +Bazerka:  /eval ta this is a test\; and some more
06:25 +JoeMaverickSett: hello, how do i move to window 20? what's the shorcut key? my key stops at alt+o for 19.
06:26 +Bazerka: in fact, you don't even need to do that
06:26 +Bazerka:  /alias ta topic $0- | $topic
06:26 +Bazerka:  /ta test; test some more
06:26 +Bazerka: works fine here
06:27 +Bazerka: JoeMaverickSett: there is no default binding for window 20
06:28 +JoeMaverickSett: Bazerka: oh, okie.so, i'd have to make one myself then.
06:28 +Bazerka: there's various options available, bind some more keys, /window 20, use a modified dispatch.pl to allow /20, etc
06:29 +JoeMaverickSett: ah, okie. thanks.
06:29 +Bazerka: http://niklas.laxstrom.name/page/eng/irssi
06:30 +Bazerka: is quite useful if you don't mind losing the existing binds of Q-P
06:30 +Bazerka: then you can simply press meta-q q for 11, meta-r i for 48, etc
06:31 +Bazerka: or is it meta-q, meta-q for 11 and meta-r, meta-r for 48 - I can never remember
06:32 +Bazerka: basically, it turns Q-P stacked keypresses into numbers, Q=1, W=2, E=3, so QQ gives 11, EQ gives 31, etc
06:32 +JoeMaverickSett: okie. i'll try it out. :)
06:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ampzqlox]
06:33 +Bazerka: it's not for everyone, but you may like it :)
06:33 +Bazerka: (*correction meta-r, meta-i)
06:54 +tmr: Some use same schema with numbers, meta-08, meta-46 etc.

07:27 +Bazerka: tmr: doesn't that have problems for win 1-9 tho?
07:27 +Bazerka: which is why it uses q-p instead of 1-9
07:34 +JoeMaverickSett: hello, again, how do i bind right Alt and left arrow key to /window previous? i can't seem to get it.

15:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v znx]
15:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisB1y]
15:21 +finger_: that these scripts do not work for windows ...
15:24 +lestat: finger_: getting any perl error ?
15:24 +lestat: have you installed perl interpreted ?
15:24 +lestat: *interpreter
15:26 +vague`: finger_, sure, if you have a working perl installation. Place the scripts in %APPDATA%/irssi
15:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ik]
15:26 +vague`: Had to look looong and hard for that one, nkew it started with %APP then I drew a blank
15:26 +ik: I know this is on the internet, and I couldn't find it. I humbly offer a leftover cheeseburger and a bag of rocks in compensation
15:27 +ik: how do I set the level at which numbers appear on the statusbar?
15:27 +ik: (ie for notices and msg, but not join/quit..)
15:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hamerikanetza]
15:31 +finger_: lestat, vague` ,eh the only thing that was installed this irssi_0_8_12_setup_2.exe .. or because I have to install perl scripts that I'm so used to linux irssi on my work, right?
15:32 +vague`: ik, /set actlist_sort recent|level|refnum ?
15:32 +ik: vague`: that's excellent too actually
15:33 +ik: vague`: but I'm looking to have them not light up if somebody just joined or something
15:33 +ik: so that my statusbar is not full of nonevents in channels I never look at
15:33 +shabble: ik: /set activity_ignore_levels, iirc
15:33 +ik: awesome that's it
15:33 +ik: thanks
15:33 +shabble: activity_hide_level, sorry
15:33 +ik: yea go go gadget tab completion
15:34 +shabble: heh
15:34 +ik: half a cheeseburger to you *nod*
15:34 +lestat: finger_: i don't understand your question
15:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zambezi]
15:36 +Nei: there shouldnt be any difference in "installing" the perl scripts between windows and linux, given that your irssi comes with perl
15:37 +ik: "installing": put a script in a place and remember where the place is
15:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Kraftwerk]
15:38 +finger_: lestat, forgive I do not speak English well .. dare I have to install perl on windows? to be able to run this script ...
15:39 +lestat: finger_: well, how do you want to run perl script with no perl interpreter ?
15:40 +ik: finger_: maybe this is relevant: http://anti.teamidiot.de/nei/2007/01/irssi_0810_for_windows_cygwinw/
15:40 +Nei: no, the perl needs to be integrated with irssi
15:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v puchu]
15:41 +puchu: hi
15:41 +puchu: when i start to log files
15:42 +puchu: with /window log on - is there a way to save everything that was written befor /window log on - was used?
15:42 +Bazerka: if he's using the irssi installer .exe, it will have install a perl dll
15:42 +Bazerka: and irssi will have been built to use it
15:43 +Bazerka: finger_: do you get an error when you simply execute /script ?
15:45 +finger_: Bazerka, is that, I have no perl, xDDD
15:45 +Bazerka: that doesn't answer my question
15:46 +finger_: lestat, ik, thank you very much and forgive my ignorance, thanks, thanks .
15:46 +Bazerka: what happens when you just type /script
15:49 +finger_: thx... see you later hack...

21:04 +Koffa: nice... I've used (and still use eg. here) iso88591 and everything has worked just fine... on my work irssi I use wtf8 -- which breaks rainbow.pl :/
21:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tyebud]
21:08 +nightfrog: wtf8 huh?
21:14 +Koffa: utf8
21:14 +Koffa: it breaks the two-byte chars
21:15 +Death4Life: utf8 doesn't break rainbow.pl over here
21:16 +Koffa: a-z obviously won't
21:16 +Koffa: åäö will
21:16 +Death4Life: hmm
21:16 +Death4Life: lemme try :P

21:17 +Death4Life: turns into squares here :p

21:50 +hoarycripple: Hi irssi is repeatedly segfaulting on me with a particular theme (dot). I have been using this theme for years without any problems on different computers with different distributions.  this particular install is Ubuntu 10.10 x86_64. Kernel 2.6.35.  error and backtrace is here: http://pastebin.com/WP8qVrUN
21:51 +hoarycripple: It only happens with I try to change windows.
21:51 +hoarycripple: I have tried downgrading irssi to a known working version and this doesn't work either.  Bug report posted on launchpad also.  Any ideas would be really appreciated.
21:52 +hoarycripple: well i guess kernel version isn't important.
21:54 +hoarycripple: please let me know if I can provide any more information.

23:33 +Zed`: we need a script to /ctcp version everyone here and find the moles
23:34 +Bazerka: yeah, I'm sure that will go down well :)
23:34 +Zed`: :)
23:34 +Death4Life: can't you send a ctcp version to the channel? :P
23:34 +Zed`: you can run it
23:34 +Bazerka: I don't particularly have an interest in what clients people are using
23:35 +Bazerka: the only ones of importance are irssi users ;)
23:35 +Zed`: right
23:35 +Zed`: /kickban weechat
23:35 +Bazerka: why? :)
23:35 +Zed`: </troll>
23:35 +Bazerka: heh, I'm actually a maintainer for a weechat port :P
23:35 +Zed`: oh
23:35 +Zed`: well
23:36 +Zed`: then,,,,,
23:36 +Zed`: weechat is great
23:36 +Death4Life: Zed`: you can do /ctcp #irssi version :)
23:36 +Zed`: <.<
23:36 +Zed`: should said mIRC
23:36 +yitz_: o.O
23:36 +Death4Life: someone had to try lol
23:36 +svip: Is there more I should do to get beep bells on highlights than set bell_beeps and beep_msg_level?
23:36 +yitz_: Wow
23:37 * Rhonda bites yitz_
23:37 +Bazerka: someone doing a channel wide ctcp will get cluebatted and +C will get set
23:37 +yitz_: Impressive
23:37 +bburhans: >_>
23:37 +billnye: svip: test it with /beep
23:37 * yitz_ hides
23:37 +billnye: svip: if that don't, then no amount of trying on irssi's part is going to bear fruit
23:37 +svip: Nothing happens. :(
23:38 * Rhonda . o O ( must. refrain. from. /ctcp #irssi cluebat )
23:38 +svip: My terminal is supposedly listening on terminal beeps.
23:38 +Death4Life: cluebat? Oo
23:38 +svip: So it may be screen.
23:38 +billnye: svip: you'll usually get a flash or a "wuff wuff" or something else if screen catches
23:39 +Bazerka: depends if screen has visual bell set or not
23:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
23:39 +svip: billnye: I would assume so.
23:39 +billnye: Bazerka: but if not, then it USUALLY dtrt
23:39 +svip: But I wonder if screen could be blocking it.
23:39 +svip: As there is ssh and screen between my terminal and irssi.
23:40 +Bazerka: billnye: aye
23:40 +billnye: svip: SSH shouldn't affect anything
23:40 +svip: I would not assume so, but screen might.
23:40 +Bazerka: yitz_ [~yitz_@unaffiliated/yitz-/x-6738568] requested CTCP VERSION from #irssi
23:40 * Bazerka readies the cluebat
23:40 +billnye: svip: work low to high
23:41 +billnye: svip: drop to a bare bash shell in the same context as you'd usually launch screen and do something like lean on backspace
23:41 +billnye: svip: or echo a ^G
23:41 +yitz_: 5 min too late...
23:41 +svip: billnye: Weird, nothing!
23:41 +billnye: svip: if that works, you'll know it's "above" that level, if it doesn't it's lower down
23:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Crusher4]
23:44 +Crusher4: anyone know where i can get a build of irssi for mac osx without the hasle of installing fink/macports/darwinports/etc but is still CLI and not GUI?
23:45 +Bazerka: hassle of installing macports?
23:45 +Bazerka: isn't that like a single download, single click?
23:45 +Crusher4: yeah, installing what usually turns out to be hundreds of megs of libraries and dependencies to build a single cli binary is pretty ridiculous to me
23:45 +Bazerka: er
23:46 +Bazerka: you do realise that you can download pre-built packages from macports?
23:46 +Bazerka: no building required
23:46 +Crusher4: hm, thats a new one to me
23:46 +Bazerka: at least, that's my understanding
23:47 +Bazerka: ie
23:47 +Bazerka: http://durrans.com/blog/2009/03/22/installing-irssi-using-macports/
23:47 +Bazerka: although given I'm not a mac/macports user, I may be mistaken
23:48 --- Gadjet_ is now known as Gadjet
23:49 +Crusher4: iirc, macports, et all, install a base set of libaries in /opt, and the build file for irssi in macports lists a bunch of dependencies that would already be libraries on the system...and i'm sure libraries like glib2, openssl and perl5 have dependencies of their own
23:49 +Crusher4: i'd just like a binary i can drag and drop onto a mac host without ensuring it has some special libraries, etc on it
23:49 +Bazerka: well, good luck with that :)
23:50 +Crusher4: ...there are plenty of gui ports...i guess i'm on the wrong side of the fence for this issue on the mac
23:51 +billnye: Crusher4: possibly add "static" and/or "statically" to your google hopper
