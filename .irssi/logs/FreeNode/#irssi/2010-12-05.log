18:54 +argued: hi - first time user here with irssi... question: why does irssi not recognise -j or -n commands?
18:54 +argued: in order to join I need to write the ordinary /join etc
18:54 +Death4Life: uhuh
18:54 +Death4Life: that's right...
18:55 +Death4Life: ( read the startup in the topic? )
18:55 +spb: or set up the channel as autojoin
18:55 +argued: just trying to learn guys... is there something I miss?
18:56 +mow: is it possible to bind dccserver to a port like 127.0.0.1:11000
18:56 +argued: *did not edit the config file by hand
18:57 +billnye: argued: what are these mysterious -j and -n commands you're expecting?
18:57 +Death4Life: argued: you can configure everything in irssi itself
18:57 +argued: reading the man pages as well atm... -n, --nick=NICKNAME
18:58 +argued: that is what I hoped for, therefor I abandoned xchat for irssi
18:58 +billnye: a) that's nick, where's the -j?
18:58 +argued: could u give me some usefull hints to start with?
18:59 +billnye: b) irssi doesn't expect you do to everything on the command line
18:59 +argued: billnye: I just gave 2 examples
18:59 +billnye: two examples of what?
18:59 +billnye: c) Death4Life already suggested an excellent option: read the startup howto
18:59 +billnye: (as well as the other docs on irssi.org)
18:59 +argued: billnye: b: maybe not
19:00 +mow: billnye: check out /help alias
19:00 +billnye: mow: for?
19:01 +mow: err argued I mean
19:01 +mow: lol
19:01 +argued: billnye: look, I came in here for a single reason, this is the irrsi chanel and I asked few questions, I know where I can find the docs and if I would like to get automated answers for everything I ll talk to a bot
19:01 +argued: but hey, thats just me
19:01 +argued: I ll have a look att the /help alias
19:01 +mow: argued: check out /help alias
19:02 +billnye: argued: you asked ONE question, and it was vague and unrelated to the actual details of irssi :D
19:02 +billnye: argued: if you have other questions, ask away
19:02 +billnye: we're friendly and helpful, but the docs on irssi.org are the best place to start
19:03 +billnye: there's a reason they're there :)
19:03 +mow: does anyone know on my question?
19:04 +billnye: mow: what do you mean "bind dccserver"?
19:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rusl]
19:04 +mow: I want to direct dcc server to that ip and port... I'm trying to stunnel it
19:04 +rusl: Hallo, weiß jemand von Euch wie ich ein irssi perl script so mache das nur bestimmte nutzer !op nick können? mir fehlt nur die begrenzung das nur bestimmte Leute !op nick können
19:05 +k00pa: rusl: english ?
19:05 +mow: I not sure this is even possible
19:05 +billnye: mow: not sure what part of the native irssi commands you mean by "dcc server", is all
19:06 +mow:   /DCC SERVER [<+|-scf> <port>]
19:06 +billnye: rusl: trigger.pl + shasta_friends.pl ?
19:07 +billnye: friends_shasta.pl, oops
19:07 +rusl: hmm i speak not good english i will make a perl irssi script for user test and test33 and not for other user
19:08 +billnye: mow: it seems like the answer is right there in your paste?
19:08 +billnye: mow: if not, then I still don't understand what you're asking
19:08 +rusl: z.B test: !op nick yes otheruser: !op nick no
19:08 +mow: it's not working
19:09 +sdx23: rusl: you should do that via channel modes, that's what they're for.
19:09 +mow: cause stunnel is listing on that port and dccserver thinks it's in use
19:10 +mow: billnye: dccserver wants that port for it's self
19:10 +rusl: hmm my script is to time for all i will for begrenzte people
19:10 +billnye: mow: yes, you want to tunnel some other port TO the port that dcc is listening on
19:12 +mow: billnye: maybe I'm doing it wrong... my stunnel is set to accept that port... it should work
19:13 +billnye: mow: I don't use stunnel, so I can't be positive, but yes it sounds wrong to me
19:13 +mow: ok thanks
19:13 +rusl: if ($msg =~ /^\!join\s+(.+)$/) && Nick=noname33 { how can i make a command now for noname33?
19:13 +billnye: think of the DCC port as the equivalent of port 80 on a webserver
19:14 +billnye: I wouldn't expect your tunnel app to LISTEN on port 80
19:14 +billnye: but I could be wrong, as I said
19:24 +mow: billnye: I started stunnel after dcc server this time and it seemed to work
