00:06 +hatseflats: can I use autosendcmd from irssi' config file to automagically send multiple commands?
00:06 +grawity: Preemptive "You're doing auto-login wrong" answer
00:06 +grawity: But yes, separate them with ;

00:07 +n00ch: howdy gang
00:07 +n00ch: does anyone think that the highlight feature of IRSSI is somewhat flakey?
00:07 +hatseflats: eh, autosendcmd is then not the way to automagically identify with nickserv?
00:07 +n00ch: a lot of lines that don't have my nick in them get highlighted
00:10 +ds187: n00ch: if its hilights rows where your nick doesn't appear then you configured something wrong :-)
00:11 +ds187: n00ch: what does /hilight output

00:23 +knittl: hi. shouldn't /j #joined_channel switch to that channel?
00:24 +knittl: iirc it did in the past
00:24 +n00ch: it does for me
00:24 +n00ch: thethe alias has to be defined in your config
00:25 +knittl: it does not work when i use <tab> to autocomplete the channel name
00:25 +n00ch: aliases = { J = "join";
00:25 +knittl: hm. irssi seems to interpret the space after the name part of the name
00:25 +knittl: n00ch: joining works. but when i am already present in that channel and use tab-completion a space is inserted after the name

02:32 +mingdao: justlooks: you want to change your nick?
02:32 +mingdao: justlooks:  /j #freenode and ask
02:32 +n00ch: justlooks: if you join #freenode and ask an op, they will take care of you
02:32  skizzhg: /ns help drop
02:33 +justlooks: mingdao: some channel ban root
02:33 +mingdao: justlooks: yes, and that is A Good Thing (TM)
02:33 +mingdao: justlooks: but that is joining as root ... it does not matter what your nick is
02:34 +mingdao: justlooks: do not login to your system, or run X as root
02:34 +mingdao: justlooks: only use root to do system maintainence
02:35 +justlooks: mingdao: thanks for your advice
02:35 +mingdao: justlooks: your account name is justlooks
02:35 +mingdao: justlooks: there is nothing to do with root associated with your account ;)
02:36 +mingdao: justlooks: you can issue: /msg nickserv info justlooks     and look at your registration information
02:37 +mingdao: justlooks: about "if a nickname is not used in 60 days"
02:37 +mingdao: justlooks: if you don't login and identify with irc.freenode.net in 60 days, your nickname will expire and someone else can register it
02:37 +mingdao: justlooks: I think the new ircd allows nick protection or something for that
02:38 +mingdao: justlooks:  /join #freenode and ask and they will be glad to help you
02:43 +justlooks: mingdao: can i use shell command to filter info from server? like i list all channel and want to see all channel which name include "mysql"?
02:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v DarthWader]
02:46 +mingdao: justlooks: I don't understand your question ... best to ask the whole channel and not just person
02:47 +mingdao: justlooks: if I understand your question ... you want to search freenode for channels with a certain name?
02:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nightfrog]
02:48 +justlooks: mingdao: yes
02:49 +justlooks: mingdao: like in UNIX can use "cat file|grep XXX"

02:53 +mingdao: justlooks: grep pattern file  ....  no need for cat
02:55 +justlooks: mingdao: yes i mean " many many info from irc server|grep thins my look for " :)
02:56 +n00ch: justlooks: i would be curious to know that as well
02:56 +n00ch: justlooks: first of all, how do you list every channel?
02:57 +mingdao: justlooks: did you issue the command bremner gave you?
02:57 +mingdao: if    /msg alis help LIST    does not answer that question, ask in #freenode ... they know all those answers
02:58 +justlooks: n00ch: for instance,i like join some channel about gentoo,but i am not know exactly the channel name
02:58 +n00ch: justlooks: yep i get what you are trying to do
02:58 +n00ch: justlooks: but i dont even know how to (or if there is a way) to list every channel that is open on the net
02:58 +n00ch: justlooks: do you know how to do that part of it?
02:59 +n00ch: is it just /list
02:59 +n00ch: ?
02:59 +mingdao: justlooks: /msg alis LIST *gentoo
02:59 +nightfrog: /list?
02:59 +justlooks: n00ch: i do not know ,i am a newbie :)
02:59 +mingdao: justlooks: /j #gentoo-cn  ;)
03:01 +mingdao: justlooks: actually   /msg alis LIST *gentoo* -min 25      is better
03:01 +n00ch: what is alis?
03:01 +mingdao: justlooks: if you want something specific about a gentoo channel, you can /j #gentoo and they will tell you
03:01 +bremner: n00ch: a bot, on freenode
03:02 +justlooks: mingdao: o
03:02 +mingdao: n00ch: /msg alis help
03:02 +mingdao: justlooks: #gentoo-cn is very slow channel
03:03 +n00ch: mingdao: when i do that it returns "no such nick/channel"
03:03 +justlooks: mingdao: what means "very slow"?
03:04 +justlooks: mingdao: /msg alis LIST *gentoo* -min 25 has not any output
03:04 +mingdao: justlooks: there are not many people in #gentoo-cn and they don't answer fast
03:04 +justlooks: mingdao: i get output now ...

03:12 +n00ch: mingdao: one thing im a bit worried about is my IP address being available for anyone to see
03:12 +mingdao: n00ch: I started using IRC in 2003 but didn't like the atmosphere and have come and gone since
03:12 +mingdao: n00ch: I have so much other work I don't have time to read and learn about all apps
03:13 +mingdao: n00ch: but I log channels and awk is my friend for searching logs ... when I take the tiem
03:13 +n00ch: mingdao: you log channels? how do you do that?
03:13 +nightfrog: ask #freenode for a different host
03:13 +mingdao: n00ch: ?
03:13 +mingdao: nightfrog: ?
03:14 +nightfrog: join #freenode aand ask for a cloak
03:14 +mingdao: n00ch: it's in the irssi startup docs or whatever it's called on the home page
03:15 +mingdao: nightfrog: oh, to n00ch
03:15 +nightfrog: Correct
03:15 +n00ch: nightfrog: when you first said to ask for a diff host was that a mistake or what you meant?
03:16 +nightfrog: Although you can get someones ip no matter what if you want to invest the time
03:16 +nightfrog: What I meant
03:16 +n00ch: nightfrog: so whats the diff between a different host and a cloak?
03:17 +nightfrog: You could use a proxy also but a lot are banned. You could setup a bouncer on a remote server too

06:49 +yitz_: Yeah
06:49 +yitz_: I think I got it to work sorta?
06:50 +yitz_: I loop through the sort functions and each one reduces the list size
06:50 +yitz_: Until you hit 1 or 0 windows
06:51 +yitz_: The only problem with with is there's a whitelist sort function. An earlier sort might reduce the list to just hilighted windows and the whitelist would reduce the list to nothing when, in fact, there might be a lower level act in one of the whitelisted channels
06:52 +tmr: Sooo.. You're talking about some script?
06:53 +yitz_: Yeah...
06:53 +yitz_: Weren't you one of the peoples discussing changing the script so you could specificy the sort functions via a setting?
06:54 +tmr: Uh, I doubt it.. I'm not running script like that.

06:55 +tmr: No harm done.
06:59 +yitz_: Zed`: wget http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack/raw/yitz/ack.pl -> Lemme know if it breaks everything? Reversing the whitelist gives blacklist. Should the whitelist channel refs be part of the ack_sorts string or remain in a seperate var?

07:29 +jayne: So... I just segfaulted irssi. It's not supposed to do that, right? http://codepad.org/Ozvi8SF6
07:36 +dhruvasagar: hey can I make the notices like pm to come in the current window ?
07:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v openess]
07:39 +jayne: you mean like by changing autocreate_own_query?
07:40 +jayne: oh wrong setting. autocreate_query_level is probably the one you want.
07:40 +dhruvasagar: anyone?
07:40 +jayne: Apparently I'm on /ignore, if anyone else wants to tell dhruvasagar what I just said.
07:41 +dhruvasagar: jayne: you're not on ignore
07:41 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I didn't realize you're talking to me...
07:42 +jayne: you were the only one who asked about making msgs be in the current window
07:42 +dhruvasagar: jayne: yes, but I couldn't really tell if what you said was for that
07:43 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I am still trying to get help for that setting
07:43 +jayne: just do /set autocreat
07:43 +jayne: and /help levels if you're not already familiar with them
07:45 +dhruvasagar: jayne: ok checking it out, thanks
07:47 +dhruvasagar: jayne: not really getting it
07:47 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I set it to MSGS
07:47 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I want to see the PMs in the current window
07:52 +jayne: then you probably want it to /not/ contain MSGS
07:54 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I don't get it :(
07:54 +jayne: autocreate_query_level is a list of levels that will trigger automatic creation of a separate query window
07:55 +dhruvasagar: jayne: but I dont want a separate query window
07:55 +dhruvasagar: do I need to turn autocreate_own_query off ?
07:55 +jayne: no, ignore that setting. That was just me being confused.
07:55 +dhruvasagar: ok
07:56 +dhruvasagar: same here
07:56 +jayne: if you don't want MSGS to autocreate a query window, then what should NOT be in the list of things that autocreate query windows?
07:59 +dhruvasagar: jayne: how do I see the list of things that autocreate query windows ?

08:02 +jayne: with /set autocreate_query_level
08:02 +dhruvasagar: autocreate_query_level = DCCMSGS
08:02 +dhruvasagar: that's what I see
08:03 +dhruvasagar: ok wait I think I am getting it a lil

08:03 +gsisis2: how do i scroll up to older chat in irssi
08:03 +dhruvasagar: gsisis2: use page up page down
08:03 +mingdao: gsisis2: PageUp
08:05 +dhruvasagar: jayne: I could still use some help if you're there...
08:06 +jayne: dhruvasagar: what's your question?
08:06 +dhruvasagar: jayne: still the same...not able to make the PMs come in the current window
08:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v uzsolt]
08:10 +dhruvasagar: jayne: in any case you never told me what the setting should be to get PMs in current window...you just told me that autocreate_query_level could help me...
08:12 +jayne: So you want msgs to go to whatever the current window is, or to a specific window?
08:12 +dhruvasagar: jayne: current window
08:13 +jayne: what does /window level say about your status window?
08:13 +jayne: and what is /set window_check_level_first set to?
08:13 +dhruvasagar: ALL'
08:14 +jayne: set it to all -MSGS
08:22 +dhruvasagar: ok
