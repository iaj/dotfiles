09:59  Gryllida: please wait a bit
10:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v preller]
10:01  Gryllida: justlooks,   *!~root@* is what they banned, you just see /set username or /set user_name , and reconnect; this is done because they don't want people who login as root to use irc.
10:02 +justlooks: Gryllida: thanks i will try
10:03 +justlooks: Gryllida: you mean i need reconnect freenode?
10:05  Gryllida: justlooks, your system username is what becomes the default usename, so if you irc as root, you match that ban.
10:06  Gryllida: justlooks, to change the username, you need to find the setting, change it via the /set command, /save, and reconnect to the server.

11:10  Gryllida: bburhans, it was all-ops some time ago
11:10  Gryllida: I see that in the themes screenshots
11:10  Gryllida: It's just a tradition, though all-ops was removed, I guess due to abuse
11:13 +bburhans: I don't remember it being +O since I've been here...
11:13 +bburhans: you sure that wasn't on oftc or something?
11:13  Gryllida: if oftc has #irssi, then probably yes

13:13 +Cadynum: hey. im using irssi and AWL. its working fine except that there seems to be quite the delay on the AWL part when switching channels compared to the rest of irssi.
13:13 +juk_: someone gotta tell me here why irssi says Invalid argument when /connect irc.ubuntu.com 8001
13:13 +Cadynum: anyone know how to fix this?
13:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v martin3z]
13:15 +juk_: what's Invalid argument supposed to mean here?
13:16 +Bazerka: juk_: can you paste the exact output?
13:17 +juk_: 19:17 -!- Irssi: Looking up irc.ubuntu.com
13:17 +juk_: 19:17 -!- Irssi: Connecting to irc.ubuntu.com [140.211.166.3] port 8001
13:17 +juk_: 19:17 -!- Irssi: Unable to connect server irc.ubuntu.com port 8001 [Invalid argument]
13:18 +Bazerka: do you have a -host set for the network? (or a /set hostname ) ?
13:19 +juk_: Bazerka: proxy? no
13:19 +Bazerka: I didn't say proxy :)
13:19 +Bazerka: check those settings please
13:21 +juk_: Bazerka: sorry, yes it's set to my fqdn
13:21 +Bazerka: clear that setting
13:21 +Bazerka: and try again
13:21 +Bazerka: (or make sure it's an host/ip that the machine actually has)
13:21 +Bazerka: but if you aren't multi-homed, best to just clear it
13:22 +Bazerka: multi-homed/using multiple ips
13:23 +Bazerka: I suspect the invalid argument is coming because irssi can't bind to the hostname you specified for it's src address
13:23 +Bazerka: *its
13:24 +juk_: Bazerka: it's got connected
13:24 +Bazerka: great
13:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
13:27 +juk_: Bazerka: so hostname, what it's supposed to be?
13:27 +Bazerka: it's the src address irssi will bind to when establishing a connection out
13:28 +Bazerka: eg, you may have a machine that has multiple IPs and you want to make a connection out from a specific IP
13:28 +Bazerka: mainly used for vhosts
13:28 +Bazerka: *vanity vhosts
13:29 +Bazerka: if you don't have multiple IPs on the machine, it has no use
13:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peeaivo]
13:32 +juk_: Bazerka: I tried with my ip dynamic ip not worked says cannot assign, and then with my local ip 192.. worked
13:33 +juk_: Bazerka: ok thanks for info, bye
13:34 +lewellyn: juk_: it must be set to an IP that the machine itself has, not your router.
13:34 +lewellyn: bah

13:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Quaxir]
13:38 +Quaxir: Here comes some more questions :D. Is it possible to make irssi send 2 questions when connecting to network? Example: nick change + auth command?
13:39 +Death4Li1e: yes
13:39 +Quaxir: Death4Li1e: Do you mind sharing that knowledge :)?
13:40 +bburhans: Quaxir: see /help network, -autosendcmd
13:40 +bburhans: you can put semicolon-delimited commands there.
13:40 +bburhans: for example, on some networks I have /msg nickserv identify mypass; wait 2000;
13:41 +Bazerka: lewellyn: in his case, it needn't be set at all :)
13:41 * Bazerka spies Quaxir 
13:42 +lewellyn: Bazerka: yes
13:44 +Quaxir: bburhans: Thanks :). Why it's advisable to wait 2000ms btw?
13:45 +bburhans: Quaxir: nickserv might take a moment to cloak me.
13:46 +bburhans: and I want to be cloaked before joining channels.
13:46 +lewellyn: sometimes it'll take more than a moment :P
13:46 +bburhans: so as to hide my IP from some eyes ;)
13:46 +Quaxir: bburhans: Ah, yes. :)
13:46 +lewellyn: bburhans: nevermind the channels which require identification
13:46 +Quaxir: Thanks for that ;-hint anyway
13:47 +bburhans: lewellyn: right, but I'm only in ~4 of those that regularly set +r or +b $~a
13:47 +bburhans: Quaxir: same goes for aliases and evals
13:47 +bburhans: semicolon-delimited commands.
13:47 +lewellyn: likewise. but i get enough scroll in the status window as irssi pegs my cpu while rejoining everything that i have to sit and wade through to see what didn't join right :P
13:48 +Quaxir: bburhans: ookey
13:49 +bburhans: lewellyn: typically those "cannot join channel for whatever reason" messages come at the bottom, after all the cruft, so they're easy to spot if I'm sitting at the terminal when a reconnect happens.
13:50 +lewellyn: bburhans: they get lost in the chanserv spew here :P
13:50 +bburhans: oh, chanserv notices open a query for me
13:50 +bburhans: I got sick of notices going to status.
13:50 +lewellyn: i prefer not to do that
13:50 +lewellyn: i have enough windows already
13:50 +bburhans: I don't mind more windows as long as they're sorted.
13:51 +lewellyn:  .04:55 .+lewellyn+Rw zZzZ .84:freenode/#irssi+Pcgnt .Act: 6,59,61,155,156,181
13:51 +lewellyn: i have enough :P
13:51 +Quaxir: bburhans: hm, if I need to execute 2 commands (ex. a and b), should I put them like "a; b" or "b; a" if I want command a to be executed first?
13:53 +bburhans: Quaxir: they're executed in the order you give them
13:53 +bburhans: hence my msg then wait
13:53 +Quaxir: bburhans: Ookey, thanks.

20:26 +Death4Li1e: yeah, I see that
20:26 +Death4Li1e: but this network doesn't give any problems
20:26 +Death4Li1e: I'll try chaning servers on the other one
20:27 +billnye: that's the first thing I'd suggest, yeah
20:28 +Death4Li1e: seems to be the same problem :s
20:29 +Death4Li1e: maybe it's the fakelag thingy that's being annoying serverside
20:33 +Death4Li1e: I'm gonna give it some time
20:35 +ruffleS: hi. is it possible to have a weechat-like nicklist embedded on irssi?
20:35 +shabble: have a look at nicklist.pl on http://scripts.irssi.org/
20:35 +ruffleS: awesome! thanks :)

21:02 +bremner: is there a simple way to toggle hiding and showing a window?  I'd like a key that runs "/window show 1" and "/window hide 1" alternately
21:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v thoas]
21:10 +shabble: bremner: '/alias toggle_win_hide /win hide 1; /bind meta-q /toggle_win_show' and '/alias toggle_win_show /win show 1; /bind meta-q /toggle_win_hide'
21:10 +shabble: then run one of the aliases to set up the initial binding
21:11 +billnye: also I think there was a script to "minimize" (in the sense of "down to the smallest lines possible") inactive split windows

21:13 +shabble: toggle aliases like that take me back to pissing around with quake config files.
21:14 +bremner: yeah, it sounds a bit like fighting the system
21:14 +shabble: well, you could do it as a script, but I'm not sure that counts as a 'simple way'
21:15 +bremner: yeah, still not sure how I want to interact with the status window, or if I want to have one.
21:17 +billnye: I keep one and just let it sit in the background like any other window
21:17 +billnye: I have a visible joins/parts/quits window and a hilightwin window though

22:29 +soundNICK: how would I write an alias to  identify to NickServ ?
22:29 +xand: on freenode... set server password
22:30 +soundNICK: oh that will set it permanently ?
22:30 +billnye: erm
22:30 +billnye: if you set it permanently it will be set permanently
22:30 +billnye: if you don't it won't
22:30 +xand: what is your objective?
22:31 +soundNICK: I just dont want to type  /msg nickserv identify mypassword  every time I join :)
22:31 +xand: soundNICK: which network?
22:31 +soundNICK: freenode
22:31 +xand: right
22:32 +grawity: (+xand) on freenode... set server password
22:32 +xand: set a server password of soundNICK:yourpassword
22:32 +soundNICK: ok... would this be in a configuration file... or command line ?
22:33 +soundNICK: an alias would be fine
22:33 +billnye: soundNICK: /help network, /help server, /help channel
22:33 +xand: soundNICK: that would be doing it wrong
22:33 +soundNICK: thanks sci-guy
22:33 +billnye: soundNICK: irssi provides many standard methods to save the stuff you'd typically want saved

23:09 +soundNICK: hmm... how do I close a window which isnt a channel ?
23:09 +Bazerka: the same way as any other window
23:09 +billnye: soundNICK: queries are /q to create and to close
23:09 +Bazerka:  /window close (to close current window) or /window close # (where # is its number)
23:09 +soundNICK: ah nice
23:10 +Bazerka: you can also close a range of consecutive windows with /window close start# end#
23:10 +soundNICK: ooo
23:10 +Bazerka: eg, /window close 10 20
23:11 +Bazerka: which will close windows 10 to 20 inclusive
23:12 +soundNICK: err... can you use a wildcard to close just the current window ?
23:12 +billnye: soundNICK: no number necessary
23:12 +soundNICK: ah great...thanks again peeps

23:38 +lucapost: I have a problem with irssi and sasl authentication
23:38 +lucapost: I get this error
23:38 +lucapost: Math::BigInt: couldn't load specified math lib(s), fallback to Math::BigInt::Calc at /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/Crypt/DH.pm line 6
23:38 +lucapost: can anybody help me?
23:38 +lucapost: irssi on gentoo stable
23:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Miles]
23:41 +Bazerka: isn't that just a warning, not an error?
23:42 +Bazerka: a wild guess is that libgmp may make it go away
23:44 +lucapost: Bazerka: I have gmp-4.3.2
23:45 +lucapost: can I update to 5.0.1?
23:45 +grawity: When the question is "update", it's "must".
23:45 +grawity: :D
23:46 +grawity: Try installing Math::BigInt::GMP from cpan.

23:59 +abortici1e: is there a way to turn on a buffe so that messages will be sure to be delivered to the channel in case of slow-sync ?
23:59 +abortici1e: let me give you an example; if i join a channel and type my message before irssi tells me it has synced, the channel won't get it
23:59 +abortici1e: and sometimes sync can take up to 50 seconds1
23:59 +abortici1e: !
23:59 +abortici1e: i'm not tunneling or anything fancy
23:59 +abortici1e: not even SSL
