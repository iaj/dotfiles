00:42 +sharku: hi all
00:43 +sharku: was wondering if there was a way to hide all joins and quits in irssi?
00:43 +mauke: can be done with /ignore
00:43 +sharku: so /ignore join?
00:44 +mauke: no
00:44 +share: sharku: /ignore * JOIN PART QUIT
00:44 +sharku: how should i type syntax
00:44 +sharku: oh ok
00:44 +mauke: wasn't it JOINS PARTS QUITS?
00:44 +mauke: /help ignore
00:44 +share: it works lol
00:44 +share: sharku: btw ignore CTCP too
00:44 +sharku: oh
00:45 +share: or even DCC
00:45 +share: :p
00:45 +sharku: dcc is direct connect?
00:45 +share: ye
00:45 +sharku: yah i dont need that
00:45 +sharku: how do i reactivate it
00:45 +sharku: once i ignore it
00:45 +mauke: /help ignore
00:46 +share: sharku: when you ignore it starts ignoring
00:47 +share: grrrr
00:47 +share: im trying to connect with http proxy
00:48 +share: it works fine in xchat
00:48 +share: but not in irssi
00:48 +sharku: o
00:48 +sharku: yah i got it
00:48 +sharku: i didnt know about the /help
00:48 +sharku: started reading it
00:48 +sharku: didn't see a part
00:48 +sharku: i saw join and quit
00:48 +share: sharku: /help ignore
00:49 +share: thats what you want
00:49 +sharku: yah i read it
00:49 --- SleepyCharChar is now known as CHarmander
00:49 +share: sharku: just type /ignore * JOIN PART QUIT CTCP DCC
00:50 +share: * = all
00:50 +sharku: lol ok
00:50 +sharku: quits worked though
00:50 +sharku: it took that
00:50 +sharku: instead of quit
00:50 +share: sharku: then /save
00:51 +share: sharku: it doesnt refresh the old quit joins parts..
00:51 +share: only after you start ignoring
00:51 +sharku: yeah, i got it

00:53 +sharku: cause these seem like regular irc commands
00:54 +share: sharku: you can also change what you display
00:54 +share: user_name and real_name
00:54 +share: with /set
00:55 +sharku: ohh

06:27 +c00kiemon5ter: I just ignored quits and parts and joins on a channel but messages keep coming up on the status window now (!?)
06:27 +c00kiemon5ter: how can I fix this ?
06:30 +kaushal: I have scripts folder under .irssi
06:30 +kaushal: is there a way to load all the scripts at one go ?
06:31 +kaushal: I have upgraded my Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10
06:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v yitz_]
06:32 +Dirm: kaushal: this should do it /script exec foreach(`ls ~/.irssi/scripts`){Irssi::command("script load $_");}
06:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vincent_wang]
06:32 +Dirm: though ideally you'd just link them all in ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun
06:32 +Dirm: and then you don't need to manually load them in the future
06:32 +Dirm: c00kiemon5ter: what messages are coming up?
06:32 +c00kiemon5ter: Quits
06:32 +Dirm: and what's your ignore line?
06:32 +Dirm: ah
06:33 +c00kiemon5ter:  /ignore #archlinux JOINS PARTS QUITS MODES CLIENTCRAP CRAP
06:33 +kaushal: Dirm: ok
06:33 +Dirm: quits aren't associated with a channel
06:33 +c00kiemon5ter: oh
06:33 +c00kiemon5ter: so I should ignore * quits ?
06:33 +Dirm: yeah if you're ok with not seeing any quits
06:34 +c00kiemon5ter: hmm, ok, makes sense now
06:34 +Dirm: I just use /set activity_hide_level joins parts quits
06:34 +Dirm: they still show in the window, they just don't trigger the activity indicator
06:34 +c00kiemon5ter: yes, that's nice

07:06 +JC`: i dunno who runs irssi with 0 scripts, though ;-)
07:06 +yitz_: Yeah. greo your scripts for IS_CHANNEL ?
07:12 +shabble: that won't help, it's an internal assertion failure in nicklist.c
07:12 +shabble: The only obvious script function which would trigger it is $channel->nicks
07:13 +shabble: JC`: which scripts, specifically?
07:14 +kaushal: hi again
07:14 +kaushal: can some one please ping me again
07:20 +JC`: shabble: 3 of my loaded scripts have references to ->nicks, autoopper.pl, clones.pl, and usercount.pl
07:21 +shabble: I'd guess that something was trying to update after your kick, and then found itself without a channel reference after you got kicked.
07:21 +shabble: not quite sure how that could happen though, unless there's some sort of wonky race condition somewhere
07:23 +shabble: if you're feeling keen, set up a bot and see if it's repeatable? :)

20:15 +r4__: its silly
20:15 +Death4Life: irssi is one!
20:15 +r4__: more or less its a bash script
20:16 +shabble: the only thing I can think of that's worse than editing the config by hand, is using bash ;p
20:16 +r4__: so should everything i want be possible to configure from the irssi cmd line?
20:17 +shabble: yes
20:17 +r4__: ok
20:17 +r4__: sounds like i should maybe start from scratch and do it write =]
20:17 +r4__: right even HAH!
20:17 +shabble: there's a very small selection of thing syou can't do from inside irssi
20:17 +shabble: but, hopefully, but the time you come to needing htem, you know enough not to break the conf :p
20:18 +r4__: really (as of now) i just need to set my window layout and autoconnect settings

20:31 +djmitche: I just restarted irssi, and the bar listing all of my channels is empty now
20:31 +djmitche: a diff confirms I didn't change the config.. pointers on what to do?
20:31 +Dirm: maybe there's a script you didn't load
20:31 +billnye: djmitche: are you joined to the channels that are missing from the bar?
20:31 +Dirm: like adv_windowlist or chanact
20:32 +djmitche: billnye: yes, for example, #irssi is missing :)
20:32 +djmitche: hm, let me look at scripts
20:33 +djmitche: Dirm: I've never used those scripts
20:33 +djmitche: it's gentoo, so it's possible I upgraded and didn't see it in the list at some point
20:33 +Dirm: is there anything that looks like 'act' when you type /statusbar window?
20:33 +djmitche: would those scripts be required in newer versions?
20:34 +djmitche: 13:33 -!- Irssi: Statusbar doesn't exist: window
20:34 +Dirm: hmmmm :)
20:34 +Dirm: what names show up if you do /statusbar?
20:34 +djmitche: window_inact, prompt, topic, awl_0
20:35 +Dirm: sounds like you were using adv_windowlist at some point
20:35 +djmitche: ages ago, yes
20:35 +Dirm: ah
20:35 +djmitche: is it the awl_0 that convinces you?
20:36 +djmitche: how can I remove that?
20:36 +djmitche: (like, probably 3 or 4 years ago)
20:36 +djmitche: (so I've restarted once or twice in the interim)
20:36 +Dirm: is it taking up a line at the bottom?
20:36 +djmitche: yes, there's a blank blue line right above the text-entry line
20:37 +Dirm: is that where the channel list was before the latest restart?
20:37 +Dirm: or was there another line that's now missing?
20:39 +djmitche: yes, that's wehre it used to be
20:39 +djmitche: hm, I wonder if the default.theme got auto-edited?
20:39 +djmitche: I keep backups of .irssi/config so that irssi can't f them up
20:39 +djmitche: but not the theme - could that do it?
20:40 +Dirm: I don't think the theme has any control over that
20:40 +shabble: /sbar awl_0 disable ?
20:41 +djmitche: well, that made the bar go away, but still no indication of which channels I'm joined to..
20:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]
20:41 +shabble: sorry, I haven't been keeping up. You mean the channel you're currently in, or a list of all the channels?
20:42 +djmitche: the list of all channels
20:42 +billnye: djmitche: default irssi statusbar doesn't tell you what channels you're in, just which ones have activity
20:42 +shabble: djmitche: yeah, that's not actually available in stock irssi, afaik. You need a script (such as adv_windowlist) to do it for you.
20:42 +billnye: djmitche: it takes a script like chanact or awl to put a full listi n your bar
20:42 +djmitche: before I accidentally /quit, I had a bar right above my prompt that listed [#1 buidlbot] [#2 amanda]
20:42 +djmitche: when I restarted, it's gone
20:43 +djmitche: so what happened & how to I get back?
20:43 +billnye: djmitche: /statusbar awl_0 enable
20:43 +billnye: djmitche: then load awl :P
20:43 +djmitche: but how was this working without awl?
20:43 +billnye: it wasn't.
20:43 +djmitche: seeing as how I don't have awl
20:43 +djmitche: yes, it was.
20:44 +billnye: moot point, as it's not verifiable now
20:44 +billnye: a wizard did it.
20:44 +djmitche: fair enough
20:44 +djmitche: I really don't like irssi's inclusion of wizards - it regularly kills its config
20:44 +djmitche: anyway, I'll install that script
20:45 +shabble: damn those wizzards.
20:45 +djmitche: oh: 13:44 -!- Irssi: Error loading module adv_windowlist/core: /usr/lib64/irssi/modules/libadv_windowlist_core.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
20:45 +djmitche: so it's a gentoo problem :)
20:45 +shabble: um
20:45 +shabble: /script load, not /load
20:45 +djmitche: I guess it's not so much a script as an extension :)
20:45 +billnye: wwwyzzerdd
20:45 +djmitche: 13:45 -!- Irssi: Script adv_windowlist not found
20:46 +djmitche: would irssi have deleted the script for some reason?
20:46 +Dirm: wild guess but /script load autorun/adv_windowlist ?
20:46 +shabble: unlikely, but you might have?
20:46 +djmitche: hrm
20:46 +djmitche: well, I'll go get it

20:49 +Dirm: mr t ate my config
20:49 +djmitche: dunno what happened with the script
20:49 +shabble: I've trashed a few configs
20:49 +djmitche: but the autosave has occasionally mis-saved a config
20:49 +shabble: but I have a testing version with confs in git for that :D
20:49 +djmitche: anyway, working now, so thanks
20:49 +djmitche: maybe older gentoo versions included that script
20:49 +billnye: djmitche: never happened here, fwiw
20:50 +shabble: djmitche: there's often a separate 'irssi-scripts' package for various distros
20:50 +billnye: it may have saved settings I didn't want saved, but that's not the same thing :)
20:50 +shabble: billnye: /save clobbering theme changes is one of the more annoying ones
20:50 +djmitche: & sorry for the whining -- frustrating when I can't get work done :)

20:51 +Koffa: did someone answer my q about removing a single users nick with trigger.pl?

20:52 +Koffa: shabble: there's a news channel and the only one talking is a single bot. thus it's longish nick is waste of space. can it be nullified/shortened with eg trigger.pl?
20:53 +shabble: Koffa: I have '-rawin -regexp '^(:)(Malcolm)(!.+?@.*$)' -replace '$1bob$3'' which does htat

20:55 +Koffa: but that's a huge improvement anyway...
20:56 +shabble: I'm not sure how precise that regex neesd to be, and if there can be any collateral damage, since you're rewriting the underlying messages from the server
