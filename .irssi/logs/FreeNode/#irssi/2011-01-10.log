03:01 +EnigmaticCoder: How do I set the max size of irclogs?
03:01 +yitz_: Logs or scrollback buffer?
03:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Tam^]
03:01 +EnigmaticCoder: (I'm using autolog)
03:02 +EnigmaticCoder: Logs
03:02 +yitz_: I wasn't away there was a limit on log size...
03:03 +EnigmaticCoder: Perhaps there's not
03:03 +EnigmaticCoder: I wonder if there's a way to do this through my OS, Ubuntu?

03:12 +jink: EnigmaticCoder: You could run a cronjob to purge old logs?
03:12 +EnigmaticCoder: jink: That would probably work
03:12 +jink: I run a cronjob to bz2 old logs.
03:12 +EnigmaticCoder: jink: I keep all the logs from one channel in a single logfile though
03:12 +jink: Oh. :)
03:13 +jink: Mine are by day.
03:13 +jink: /usr/bin/find $HOME/.irssi/logs/ -type d -path "$(/bin/date "+*/%Y/%m/%d")" -prune -o -type f -name "*.log" -print0 | /usr/bin/xargs -0r /bin/bzip2
03:14 +EnigmaticCoder: What does that command do?
03:15 +jink: Find, in the logs dir, directories with today's date, skip those, for the rest, find files with name *.log and print a list of them.  For that list, bzip2 them.

03:38 +EnigmaticCoder: :P It's quite unlikely of course
03:38 +jink: 252M    ./.irssi/logs
03:38 +EnigmaticCoder: I was kind of hoping for a system that would work like a terminal. After a certain number of lines, new lines are appended, everything gets pushed up, and old lines are lost
03:39 +jink: I don't think you can do that to open files.
03:39 +yitz_: The scrollback log does that
03:39 +jink: For the window, sure.  But this is for the autolog (on disk).
03:40 +yitz_: If you don't want to keep more than X lines, why not just stick to the scrollback buffer?
03:40 +jink: Not sure, we'd have to ask EnigmaticCoder.
03:41 +EnigmaticCoder: Because I want to check logs after I've closed irssi
03:41 +EnigmaticCoder: At my leisure in other words
03:41 +yitz_: 634M in logs...
03:41 +EnigmaticCoder: wow :P
03:42 * yitz_ compresses
03:43 +EnigmaticCoder: I guess if worse came to worst, I could just delete the log files if my disk drive was full
03:43 +EnigmaticCoder: I haven't had a full disk drive in years, however
03:44 +yitz_: Or use logrotate to delete logs more than a day old
03:44 +EnigmaticCoder: That might work, let me look into it
03:44 +yitz_: Hrm. gzip -9? bzip2?
03:45 +yitz_: EnigmaticCoder: http://www.chovy.com/linux/logging-irssi-and-rotating-them-with-logrotate/

03:46 +yitz_: Woo! Down to 530M
03:47 +yitz_: Logging channels for over 2 years
03:48 +EnigmaticCoder: Did you log on every day during those two years?
03:48 +yitz_: My client runs 24/7
03:48 +yitz_: Irssi uptime: 34d 21h 28m 6s
03:48 +EnigmaticCoder: Nice :)
03:48 +yitz_:  21:48:34 up 105 days, 20:19,  0 users,  load average: 1.10, 0.97, 0.79
03:48 +yitz_: Some script managed to crash irssi :D

03:50 +EnigmaticCoder: brb
03:53  Gryllida: yitz_: report the bug
03:53 +yitz_: It was a tweak I made to a script
03:56 +EnigmaticCoder: Is there a way to import an irssi config file into another config file?
03:57 +billnye: if I say "yes", it will mean "only if you do it via text processing before the config is actually launched"
03:57 +billnye: yes.
03:59 +EnigmaticCoder: I'm not sure what you mean. What is text processing? (In other words can I do #include config as I could in C?)
03:59 +billnye: I mean that my answer of "yes" is not the yes you want to hear
03:59 +billnye: and it's really a no
03:59 +EnigmaticCoder: ah
03:59 +EnigmaticCoder: lol

06:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v richo]
06:09 +richo: Is it possible for irssi to pull values (for settings in .irssi/config) From it's environment?
06:13 +yitz_: You could write a script for that?
06:18 +richo: Might have to
06:18 +richo: Actually, no, I don't think I can
06:18 +richo: the scripting interface doesn't have access to what Iwant to do AFAIK
06:19 +richo: I could write a script to render an .irssi/config, start irrssi, then after it closes turn whatever irssi leaves behind back into a template I guess
06:19 +Bazerka: what are you trying to achieve?
06:24 +richo: I don't want plaintext passwords in my irssi config if possible
06:25 +richo: for mutt I have a script which loads the passwords from a gpg encrypted file into my environment, then starts mutt and pulls the passwords in
06:25 +tmr: And then your password will be plaintext in your env.
06:26 +richo: yes, but that env is only inherited by that mutt process
06:26 +tmr: If you can't trust your admin, you are screwed either way.
06:26 +richo: and my env is more closely controlled in terms of what can read it than my irssi config
06:27 +mauke: how so?
06:27 +richo: well, my home directory and most of the config in it is in svn to make migrating across machines easier
06:27 +richo: I'd like my irssi config to be in there too
06:27 +Bazerka: make your mind up :)
06:28 +richo: hahaha
06:28 +richo: Touche
06:28 +richo: Well, I'm only asking if it's possible, not accusing irssi of being crap because it's not :P
06:29 +Bazerka: irssi reads next to nothing form the env in terms of settings
06:29 +Bazerka: *from
06:29 +Bazerka: there's a handful at most
06:29 +richo: Yeah I know. It was a longshot, but nothing ventured nothing gained :)
06:29 +richo: Actually
06:29 +richo: ah. Scrap that, crap idea
06:30 +tmr: I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to script that though.
06:30 +richo: Could be, I can have a wrapper to decrypt my config to .irssi/config and start irssi, then crypt and delete
06:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Brownout_]
06:30 +richo: that would mean I don't have to commit the config in plaintext to svn
06:31 +tmr: Here is a weird idea, just don't use public repo?
06:32 +richo: it's not. But I am paranoid
06:32 +richo: the convenience outweighs my paranoia enough to do it, but I still prefer to keep it as secure as possible
06:33 +richo: it's privately hosted on a vps that in theory only I have access to
06:33 +Bazerka: and the person who hosts the vps
06:33 +Bazerka: or has root access to the hosting box
06:34 +vague`: Bazerka, does Irssi::command_set_options accomplish comletion too?
06:37 +richo: Bazerka: hence, in theory.
06:38 +Bazerka: vague`: I have no idea off the top of my head, sorry
06:38 +richo: OTOH, they have enough computing power there that they could probably crack my GPG encryption fairly quickly I guess
06:40 +tmr: Today anyone with few extra $ has access to enough computing power to crack weak encryption.
06:41 +richo: It's not weak. It would takes years for someone to crack it from a desktop pc
06:41 +richo: but with the amount of distributed computing power available to someone running a vps hosting operation
06:41 +tmr: Cloud services are cheap.
06:45 +vague`: Ok, I'll have to try it some day.

16:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ycas]
16:25 +Ziber: What is the name of the function I can use in a script to determine the name of the network that $target is in?

16:26 +grawity: Ziber: http://irssi.org/documentation/perl for function calls and data structures
16:26 +grawity: Ziber: http://irssi.org/documentation/signals for signal arguments
16:26 +grawity: Ziber: In a signal handler, you /always/ receive the network name - in the $server structure
16:28 +tmr: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-docs/wiki might be useful as well.
16:28 +Ziber: Well, I'm modifying hilightwin.pl, and the beginning of the sub has: "    my ($dest, $text, $stripped) = @_;" ...
16:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v explore]
16:32 +grawity: Ziber: What signal does that handle?

16:32 +grawity: signals.txt: "print text", TEXT_DEST_REC *dest, char *text, char *stripped
16:32 +grawity: then perl.txt: UI::TextDest->{}
16:32 +grawity: Has a member $dest->{server}
16:33 +grawity: So the server tag is $dest->{server}{tag} -- see perl.txt at Server->{}
16:33 +Ziber: Ah, ty :)
16:33 +grawity: btw, the files should be in /usr/share/doc/irssi/ too.
16:34 +Ziber: or ~/irssi-.0.8.15/docs, iirc.

17:33 +tmr: trigger.pl might help with that.

17:36 +bhungy: Hi, I want to search for the string "1500" in the log. /lastlog `1500 doesn't work. It interprets it as the number of lines to print.
17:36 +bhungy: any ideas ?
17:37 +jink: Yes, but I _always_ forget.  Stupidly enough.
17:37 +marsje: I get the feeling my ~/.irssi/config does not reflect my settings
17:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v WonTu]
17:37 +grawity: marsje: It does, when you /save
17:38 +jink: bhungy: /lastlog 1500 -
17:38 +marsje: grawity: I saved, but didn't look very well :)
17:38 +bhungy: jink: thanks
17:39 +jink: np. :)

17:56 +flazz: is there a way to have nickserve on freenode not open a query window? maybe just dump it in the server window?
17:56 +grawity: Depends on your IRC client
17:56 +flazz: i'm using autosendcmd to identify me and i'm always closing the first window
17:56 +flazz: irssi
17:56 +grawity: Services always reply with notices, so most IRC clients do exactly that _unless_ there is an exist...
17:56 +grawity: ah.
17:56 +grawity: Don't use autosendcmd for that, okay?
17:57 +flazz: ok, what should i use?
17:57 +grawity: There's the "server password" field in /server
17:57 +grawity: And SASL for geeks.
17:57 +grawity: And I'm in a good mood today, so I'll tell you the secret "/^msg" command too >_>
17:58 +flazz: thanks

18:06 +wwalker: My irc logs have "color" entries in them.  They are not ansi standard color sequences.  Anyone got a script that will strip these color sequences?  (I have log colors turned off ... grr, but that's a separate issue, I need to read the old log
18:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v delhage]
18:07 +billnye: wwalker: I think logcolors is irssi's messages not mIRC colors, but I'm not sure
18:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v AndrewMC]
18:18 +wwalker: s/^D.//g; s/^C..//g   makes it readable, but lots of characters ([]{}<>) are preceded by /   I could sed those too, but that seems good enough for now.
18:18 +wwalker: billnye: I'll look for a mirc to ansi translater later :-)  thanks
18:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
18:25 +tmr: log2ansi.pl ships with irssi, that might help you.
18:30 +wwalker: tmr: thanks!  my irssi must be too old ...   time to upgrade.
18:36 +wwalker: tmr: thanks, that's exactly what I needed.

19:08 +tmr: Yes, /set activity_hide_level
19:09 +Bazerka:  /ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS
19:09 +Bazerka: er
19:09 +Bazerka: ignore that
19:09 +Bazerka: ENEEDCOFFEE

19:20 +tmr: That's a bit too broad ignore for my liking, sometimes Baz has had his coffee and has useful things to say about this and that :)

20:59 +slowlearner: how do i scroll up/down if i don't have pageup/pagedown keys?
21:00 +mauke: alt-n, alt-p
21:01 +slowlearner: thanks!
21:02 +billnye: slowlearner: if you're on a phone, you can probably rebind as necessary... if you're on a mac, you probably have them and they're just hiding
21:02 +slowlearner: hmmm, doesn't work
21:02 +slowlearner: i'm on a mac
21:02 +slowlearner: a ticked 'Use option as meta key' and still doesn't work
21:02 +slowlearner: :(
21:03 +billnye: is meta sending escape?
21:03 +billnye: (i.e. if esc+n or esc+p work, it's meta's fault)
21:04 +billnye: but google thetermyou'reusing page up, and you'll probably find the sooper seekrit keycombo for pagup/down
21:04 +slowlearner: oops, googled it
21:04 +billnye: you want the one that's not "Scroll the terminal"
21:04 +slowlearner: shift + fn + up/down
21:05 +slowlearner: thanks for the help guys!
21:05 +billnye: there's too many other things meta's good for to leave that alone just because you found the fix for paging, just fyi :)
21:05 +billnye: (yw and good luck)
21:06 +slowlearner: finally! irssi is usable on my mac ^_^
21:07 +slowlearner: oh and ticked off the meta key, thanks for the heads up :D

23:36 +share: This script removes whitespace at the end of every line you type.
23:36 +share: often when you tab-complete, there's an extra space at the end of your line, it's useless, and sometimes it causes problems.
