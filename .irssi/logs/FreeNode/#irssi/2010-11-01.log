04:52 +lynx7os5: hi all, im pretty sure this is the wrong channel for this but ill ask it anyhow.. i read somewheres that irc channels are kinda connected by irc servers, does that mean one could be on say, efnet or another server and connect to this channel?
04:54 +Slizzurd: No
04:54 +tsp: lynx7os5: efnet isn't on the same network as freenode, so you'd need to have a bot bridging the channels. YOu could do it though but it wouldn't be the same
04:54 +tsp: lynx7os5: you can connect to another freenode server and get the same #irssi, since it's on the same network. The servers are linked
04:55 +tmr: "does that mean one could be on say, efnet or another server" you're confusing networks and servers.

14:02 +imMute: Babar: he probably has two servers in his network configuration.

14:03 +imMute: now lets get back to the porn.
14:03 +SpaceGhostC2C: Babar: I win?
14:03 +tmr: Use format 'accountname:password' btw.
14:03 +SpaceGhostC2C: tmr: I used server password.
14:04 +SpaceGhostC2C: tmr: Was the correct solution.
14:04 +tmr: SpaceGhostC2C, yes as server password use account:password.

14:05 +SpaceGhostC2C: Babar: I won?
14:05 +Babar: SpaceGhostC2C: yes :)
14:05 +tmr: Plain password works only if all your registered nicks are avaivable and irssi is usng one of 'em when connecting.
14:05 +SpaceGhostC2C: Babar: You're a saint, thank you for helping.
14:05 +x00malachi: so I wanted to ask if this is a standard method to use for setting up the certifcate or what is recommended to avoid MITM.
14:05 +Babar: tmr: you're right, I should have been thorough :)

16:45 +imMute: vAd0r: don't edit the config file by hand please
16:45 +imMute: DamnF00L: depends on your terminal,  have a look at mouse.pl
16:46 +vAd0r: how elese would i edit it
16:46 +DamnF00L: imMute: i am using gnome
16:46 +imMute: vAd0r: using the /commands
16:46 +vAd0r: so anything i do that way will save there
16:46 +imMute: DamnF00L: basically Irssi doesn't handle mouse events, you need ascript (mouse.pl) to do that.
16:46 +imMute: vAd0r: yes.

20:59 +eightyeight: running strace on the pid, this is what i see: http://pastebin.com/RHXq5tDh
21:01 +eightyeight: possibly the time of the server is off compared to what bitlbee thinks it should be?

23:42 +Bazerka:  /save should save all your aliases
23:42 +antoszka: Hm.
23:43 +antoszka: Maybe they're in a separate file.
