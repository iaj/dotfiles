09:51 +Fimy: i've load it
09:51 +Fimy: do i need to edit it first
09:51 +jink: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/lastspoke.pl.html
09:51 +jink: You need a setting.
09:52 +Fimy: i've try to uncheck # [settings]
09:52 +jink: No, don't edit the code.
09:52 +Fimy: owh
09:52 +Fimy: ic
09:52 +Fimy: which one then
09:52 +jink: Use /set lastspoke_channels #foo,#bar,#baz

09:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
09:53 +jink: I guess without should work.  Try it.
09:53 +Fimy: i'll try it
09:54 +jink: The idea is that scripts can define and use settings that you can set with /set.
09:54 +jink: No need to hack the source, just set the settings, and go. :)
09:54 +Fimy: aha
09:54 +jink: The top of the script just documents the setting(s) with usage examples.
09:55 +jink: Not all scripts do that, btw, but this one does. ;)
09:55 +Fimy: it's working.. i forgot that, I thought i can just /lastspoke_channels
09:55 +jink: I don't think that's what it does.  From what I just read it remember who spoke when last on a certain set of channels.
09:56 +jink: remembers*

14:52 +iElectric: mygoogle.pl seems fairly outdated
14:54 +Rhonda: then update it?
14:54 +ds187: what about google.pl
14:54 +iElectric: google.pl is from 2004
14:54 +ds187: so you have to use /google instead of !google
14:54 +iElectric: Rhonda: my perl ninja skills sux
14:55 +ds187: i don't think that the google-syntax has changed that much

15:12 +Rhonda: iElectric: it's line 65 that needs to get adjusted
15:12 +Rhonda: now bring out your regex foo, no real perl foo needed :P
15:12 +iElectric: parsing html with regex makes me shave:P
15:12 +sneep: shiver?
15:12 +iElectric: Rhonda: I took a peek at current google html and it's pretty flooded
15:12 +iElectric: <h3 class="r"><a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org/" class="l vst" onmousedown="return clk(this.href,'','','','1','-V3VP_LrrfUHaZIe7J8BEg','0CBIQFjAA')">All our code are belong to you :: <em>Kiberpipa</em>.org</a></h3>
15:12 +iElectric: this is what you want to parse.
15:12 +iElectric: so something like
15:12 +iElectric: <h3 class="r"><a href="([^"]+)".*?>(.*?)</a>
15:12 +iElectric: then you need to strip html tags in second group
15:12 +iElectric: <h3 class="r"><a.*?href="([^"]+)".*?>(.*?)</a>
15:13 +iElectric: but backtracking might kill you:P
15:13 +grawity: Don't parse HTML with regexp.
15:13 +iElectric: grawity: I agree completly.
15:13 +iElectric: I bet perl has some builtin html parser
15:14 +grawity: Builtin no, but you can be surprised at what one can find in CPAN. I can name HTML::TreeBuilder as one example
15:14 +Rhonda: Death To Dot Start!
15:14 +Rhonda: Star even
15:17 +iElectric: grawity: then it's better to use http://search.cpan.org/~ascope/Net-Google-1.0/lib/Net/Google/Search.pm
15:19 +grawity: Didn't think of that >_<

15:19 * grawity shudders at "SOAP API"
15:19 +iElectric: well there is RESTful API but you need an apikey
15:19 +iElectric: and it's compilcated.
15:21 +Rhonda: but yes, html parsing is the wrong approach :P

18:40 +Kismet010: yitz_: yep i'm using bitlbee, but i can't autoreply
18:43 +yitz_: Try http://github.com/msparks/irssiscripts/raw/master/bitlbee_autoreply.pl
18:43 +Kismet010: yitz_: don't work
18:43 +yitz_: http://www.kungfoocode.org/how-to/my-perfect-irssi-setup/ -> looks neat
18:44 +Kismet010: yitz_: i test all of "first google search" xD
18:47 +Bazerka: jkyle: it should go in ~/.irssi/scripts and then you create a symlink to it in autorun
18:47 +Bazerka: shabble: another bug!
18:48 +Bazerka: shabble: typo, although even when corrected, it exposes an irssi bug with signal_add/remove
18:48 +yitz_: Kismet010: Any particular errors with it?
18:48 * Bazerka grumbles at being cored again
18:48 +Kismet010: no
18:48 +Kismet010: just don't work
18:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
18:49 +Kismet010: i think scripts are old and protocol changes
18:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v goltoof]
18:49 +goltoof: hai room
18:49 +goltoof: how do i manage favorite channels.. get them to startup automatically, etc ?
18:50 +goltoof: and auto start ignore settings, scripts as well
18:50 +yitz_: goltoof: /help channel to auto-add channels
18:50 +yitz_: autorun to auto-load scripts as per scripts.irssi.org
18:51 +yitz_: And /save to save your settings for next run
18:51 +Bazerka: http://www.irssi.org/documentation/startup
18:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sud0]
18:51 +Bazerka: should be the first thing you read :)
18:51 +yitz_: Kismet010: You might need to fix the server tag. It's hard coded in the script to "IM"
18:52 +yitz_: Kismet010: Also, it only sends for messages that arrive in the &bitlbee channel - which you might want to comment out
18:53 +Kismet010: yitz_: and what's the correct value?
18:53 +yitz_: Depends what tag you set it to
18:53 +Kismet010: yitz_: i don't know perl..
18:53 +yitz_: Mine happens to be BitLBee but it could be anything
18:53 +Kismet010: tag is correct
18:53 +goltoof: Bazerka,  thx that's just what i needed :)
18:54 +yitz_: Kismet010: Your bitlbee server tag is IM?
18:54 +Kismet010: ummm
18:54 +Kismet010: tag is the window name?
18:54 +yitz_: No. The server name
18:55 +Bazerka: goltoof: you're welcome :)
18:55 +yitz_: If you do: /window  in a bitlbee window, it ought to list the server tag
18:55 +Kismet010: bitlbee
18:55 +yitz_: Kismet010: Or the first word on the lines displayed when you do: /server
18:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sanmarcos]
18:56 +sanmarcos: how do I connect to a new server?
18:56 +sanmarcos:  /newserver or /new dont work
18:56 +Pieter:  /connect
18:56 +sanmarcos: will it disconnect me from the current one?
18:56 +Pieter: nope
18:56 +Pieter: read /help connect and /help server
18:56 +yitz_: Kismet010: Fix that on line 27 of the script and comment out line 45
18:56 +Kismet010: yitz_: with /server get me im.bi....
18:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jkyle]
18:56 +jkyle: Ok, I'm back to this: Can't locate object method "send_raw_now" via package "Irssi::Irc::Server" at line 26
18:57 +yitz_: Kismet010: The bold word?
18:57 +sanmarcos: thanks
18:57 +Bazerka: jkyle: what's the output of /set perl_use_lib
18:57 +jkyle: seems to not be a totally off the wall error, I get hits in google but no fix
18:58 +jkyle: perl_use_lib = /opt/local/lib/perl5/darwin/darwin-multi-2level
18:58 +Kismet010: yitz_: bold?
18:58 +jkyle: ls $out => Irssi         Irssi.pm      auto          perllocal.pod
18:58 +yitz_: BitLBee: localhost:6667 (BitLBee)
18:58 +Bazerka: ok, you've hit a bug in irssi
18:59 +Kismet010: mine haven't uppercase
18:59 +Bazerka: to work around it, edit the script and under the use Irssi; line add a new line: use Irssi::Irc::Server
18:59 +Bazerka: use Irssi::Irc::Server;
18:59 +Bazerka: even
18:59 +jkyle: brb
18:59 +yitz_: Kismet010: Whatever your tag is, fix it on line 27. The script has "IM"
19:00 +Kismet010: yitz_: ok i'll try now
19:00 +yitz_: Kismet010: And comment out line 45, stop the script and restart it
19:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jkyle]
19:01 +jkyle: get this on startup
19:01 +jkyle: Can't locate Irssi/Irc/Server.pm in @INC
19:01 +Bazerka: uh
19:01 +jkyle: and when I look in /opt/local/lib/perl5/darwin/darwin-multi-2level/Irssi/, there's no Server.pm
19:01 +jkyle: checking the paths listed
19:02 +Bazerka: my bad
19:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Kismet010]
19:02 +Bazerka: chane that new line to :
19:02 +Bazerka: use Irssi::Irc;
19:02 +Kismet010: yitz_: don't work
19:02 +Bazerka: *change
19:03 +yitz_: Kismet010: If you give me ssh access to your machine, I can try to make it work

19:05 +Bazerka: all working?
19:05 +jkyle: Bazerka: yep, just need ssl verify now
19:06 +jkyle: now, I grabbed the GandiStandardSSLCA.crt and converted to a *.pem.
19:06 +Bazerka: that won't work
19:06 +Bazerka: you need the root CAs
19:06 +jkyle: ah
19:06 +Bazerka: and don't need the gandi cert at all
19:06 +jkyle: k
19:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE_]
19:06 * Bazerka points to the SSL url in the topic
19:07 +Bazerka: also, I'll commit the fix for the autoloading of Irssi::Irc being broken with non-standed perl_lib path later this week
19:08 +Kismet010: yitz_: i will try with your tips, thanks for your interest
19:08 +Bazerka: *non-standard
19:08 +jkyle: hm, I'm on osx. need to find al the root ca's on here
19:10 +Bazerka: jkyle: if push comes to shove, you can manually generate the latest mozilla bundle
19:10 +jkyle: Bazerka: they have to be here somewhere
