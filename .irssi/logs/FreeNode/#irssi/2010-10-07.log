08:34 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 80 seconds
08:38 +Bazerka: laff
08:43 +Bazerka: I think he's using a very old version of that script, which tried the algos from weakest to strongest
08:43 +Bazerka: slug fixed that ages ago
08:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alemani]
08:46 +alemani: hello i just install irssi-0.8.9-6.el4.i386.rpm the only dependency asked was libgc so libgc-6.8-2.el4.rf.i386.rpm was installed...
08:46 +alemani: this was on machine with an internet connection free
08:47 +alemani: still can't connect on that machine to any irc server...
08:47 +alemani: what should I check?
08:47 +Bazerka: 0.8.9 is positively ancient
08:48 +Bazerka: that aside, it would be helpful to know what error/warnings/etc you're getting when trying to connect to an irc server
08:50 +alemani: Bazerka: I get this, http://dpaste.com/254356/
08:50 +alemani: hangs there...
08:51 +Bazerka: curious
08:51 +Bazerka: no scripts loaded?
08:51 +alemani: none
08:52 +Bazerka: what's the command you're using to connect?
08:53 +alemani: irssi -c irc.freenode.net -n alemani

09:02 +mingdao: I also have a connecting issue. TGCF now seems to block 6667, so for FreeNode I just use: irssi -c irc.freenode.net -p 6666 -n mingdao -w <passwd>
09:03 +mingdao: So now to connect to OFTC I issue:  /connect irc.oftc.net -p 6666
09:03 +mingdao: but it doesn't
09:03 +mingdao: 15:00:36 [OFTC] ::: Irssi: Looking up irc.oftc.net
09:03 +mingdao: 15:00:36 [OFTC] ::: Irssi: Connecting to irc.oftc.net [72.32.146.136] port 6667
09:03 +Bazerka: what's with the -p?
09:04 +mingdao: -p = port
09:04 +Bazerka: if you want to connect to a specific port, you just supply the port after the hostname
09:04 +Bazerka: no options
09:04 +Bazerka:  /connect irc.oftc.net 6666
09:04 +Bazerka: oh
09:04 +mingdao: okay just did that
09:05 +mingdao: 15:04:43 [OFTC] ::: Irssi: Connecting to irc.oftc.net [72.32.146.136] port 6666
09:05 +mingdao: 15:04:43 ::: Irssi: Unable to connect server irc.oftc.net port 6666 [Connection refused]
09:05 +mingdao: what's the problem?
09:05 +Bazerka: well, it helps if you connect to a port they run an ircd on ;)
09:05 +mingdao: have also tried starting a proxy server then connecting
09:05 +Bazerka: If you're unable to connect via the default ports please use one of the alternate ports: for normal unencrypted connections use ports 6668-6670 or port 7000, for SSL encrypted connections use port 9999.
09:05 +Bazerka: from their website
09:06 +Bazerka: so try one of those ports instead of 6667
09:06 +mingdao: thank you
09:06 +Bazerka: you're welcome
09:06 +mingdao: had tried that for another ircd but it didn't work with it
09:15 +Bazerka: all good now?

10:54 +Remco: Wow, new stuff on the irssi.org frontpage
10:54 +Remco: It's been a while
10:54 +Yvemath: why does urxvt i.e. rxvt-unicode starts flickering, after i start using irssi in it. I somewhat think, that this isnt related with irssi, but nothing happens if i use any other application like mutt or newsbeuter.

16:25 +Zed`: is there a script that shows the realname of a user along with a nick and can it be used for only one chatnet?
16:28 +Steve57: Zed`: how about a /whois trigger?
