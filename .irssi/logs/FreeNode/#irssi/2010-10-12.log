08:50 +rootasaur: If you have multiple channels in the same window, do you just send text to a single one with msg?
08:50 +yitz_: Yes
08:50 +Rhonda: vague`: she? I didn't say anything. Don't be that vague with your side-remarks.
08:50 +rootasaur: yitz_: What happens if you just type.. Which channel does it go to?
08:50 +yitz_: The selected one... T
08:50 +yitz_: The input bar should show which one is selected

08:51 +rootasaur: Awesome, I appreciate the help.  Hadn't been on irc much since epic4 ;)
08:52 +Rhonda: Why one would want multiple channels in a single window evades me. It might only be needed to keep oneself awake and pay lots of attention all the time.
08:52 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 90 seconds
08:52 +yitz_: ^^ ++
08:53 +Rhonda: Hmm. Speaking of, is there some irssi rss script? One that does poll say every 10 minutes or so and put new entries into a special window?
08:53 +rootasaur: Rhonda: I'm a little confused about levels.  Could you set new channels to autocreate a new window, but msgs not?
08:53 +frogdroid: Helps in situations when you're in let's say help channels and helping in each
08:53 +Rhonda: frogdroid: I've seen so many "FC" messages that I don't really can't see the benefit, actually.
08:54 +yitz_: I just switch between the channels as activity crops up...
08:54 +yitz_: I like that RSS idea
08:55 +frogdroid: Already exists...

08:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rootasaur]

11:35 +mrkiko: but that doesn't work. If I type aniway /notify luke, my client searches for luke even in freenode, that's bad

12:57 +StalkR: thanks, I was afraid of that :(
12:57 +StalkR: this statusbar is already only for chanact; so yes I guess I could use a second statusbar and magically split chans over these two statusbar in the chanact script

14:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]

15:04 +Bazerka: exactly what I said
15:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kkady32]
15:04 +Bazerka: and without seeing your code, it's pretty hard to offer any suggestions
15:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v remiel]
15:04 +Janhouse: works with 'event join' => 'user_join',	'event part' => 'user_part',  etc.
15:05 +Bazerka: what? :)
15:05 +Janhouse: Irssi::signal_add({	'event join' => 'user_join', ... });
15:05 +Bazerka: yes, I get that
15:05 +Janhouse: it calls user_join and user_part functions on those events
15:05 +Bazerka: but without seeing your event_print sub, we can't really say why it isn't working
15:05 +Bazerka: other than you're using it wrong
15:06 +Janhouse: sub event_print { print Dumper(@_); }
15:06 +bd__: Irssi::print?
15:06 +Janhouse: works with print also
15:06 +Janhouse: if the function gets called
15:07 +Janhouse: must be wrong signal
15:07 +grawity: actually
15:07 +grawity: no, nvm
15:07 +Bazerka: 'nick mode change' is the signal that gets emitted on any nick mode change
15:07 +Bazerka: that's not in dispute
15:08 +Bazerka: so, if a mode is given to any nick in a channel, that is raised
15:08 +Janhouse: 'event mode' => 'event_print', works :)
15:09 +Janhouse: thx
15:09 +Bazerka: that's not the same thing
15:10 +Janhouse: umm... what is the difference
15:10 +Janhouse: ?
15:10 +Bazerka: and if you're saying that nick mode changes aren't working for you, then your irssi is very broken
15:10 +Bazerka: (or you're ignoring MODES)
15:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
15:10 +Bazerka: or some script is signal_add_first'ing it and sig_stopping it before your's

15:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Dan_NH]
15:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sLLiK]
15:37 +Steve57: seriously, trigger will react to ignored joins, etc.
15:38 +Bazerka: I think that has already been established ;)
15:38 +Steve57: ok. i just got here. :)
15:39 +Bazerka: ignore will prevent certain signals from being emitted tho
15:40 +Bazerka: such as some (if not all) of the 'message *' signals
15:40 +Bazerka: so if you have JOINS PARTS QUITS ignored, message (join|part|quit) won't fire for those matching ignores
15:40 * Dan_NH senses a project brewing:  modify trigger to afford the option of not acting upon ignored items.
15:41 +Bazerka: which makes sense as the ignore prevents the messages from being generated in the first place :)
15:41 +Steve57: Dan_NH, i personally would love to see that.
