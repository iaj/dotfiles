00:15 +dunpeal: what's the best way to display all windows?
00:15 +billnye: dunpeal: define "display"
00:16 +dunpeal: billnye: have a list of them on the screen at all times.
00:18 +simcop2387: personally i like adv_windowlist but some people don't like it when they've got a small terminal
00:19 +Dirm: my terminal is plenty big, thank you very much
00:20 +dunpeal: Can I put a horizontal list of windows in my statusbar?
00:20 +simcop2387: dunpeal: that's what adv_windowlist basically does
00:20 +dunpeal: preferably with a minimal [2:#irssi] rather than [2:Freenode/#irssi(+Pcgnt)]
00:21 +dunpeal: simcop2387: too bad it's an evil, evil perl script
00:21 +simcop2387: dunpeal: why's it evil?
00:21 +billnye: hee
00:22 +dunpeal: simcop2387: 1) it requires running an interpreter for no good reason,  2) it's perl
00:22 +dunpeal: if it was Lua or Python or even Javascript, I might look the other way.
00:22 +simcop2387: so reason 1 then you throw out and its just reason 2 then
00:23 +dunpeal: "might"
00:23 +dunpeal: I probably wouldn't.
00:23 +dunpeal: anyway I guess I'll compile irssi myself :/
00:24 +shabble: dunpeal: oh noes, the bloat! why not use telnet for irc, like all the rest of the 'hardcores'? ;p
00:24 +simcop2387: well it does what you're after and there's nothing wrong with perl.
00:24 +simcop2387: i'm done with that
00:25 +simcop2387: especially considering the fact that all plugins for irssi are written in perl as far as i'm aware
00:25 +dunpeal: shabble: admittedly, I am not that hardcore, so using telnet would be presumtuous for me
00:25 +shabble: scripts are, plugins are loadable native code modules.
00:26 +shabble: dunpeal: then why complain so hard about a feature you're unlikely to use, and can remove iwth a simple single command?
00:26 +simcop2387: shabble: ah so there are native plugins? was not aware of that
00:27 +shabble: the xmpp stuff is a compiled module, iirc
00:28 +simcop2387: makes sense to expose the amount of the api and internals to a script to do that would likely be really annoying to work with
00:28 +dunpeal: shabble: I'm a perfectionist :(
00:28 +dunpeal: or as we are known nowadays, OCD
00:28 +simcop2387: i think that's only if you do it repeatedly
00:28 +shabble: those things are  quite distinct
00:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Rask]
00:30 +billnye: simcop2387: the perl scripting system is a module :)
00:30 +simcop2387: also makes sense, though i would like to see a self hosting scripting module/system :)
00:30 +shabble: also, http://hg.suckless.org/sic/
00:31 +shabble: if you want to be all internet hipster about your irc
00:31 +Rask: Hey guys - bit of a strange question here, but is there any case in irssi's handling of IRC where what you type in the input bar does not get echoed to the buffer and log?
00:32 +billnye: shabble: I thought ii would be
00:32 +Rask: I'm trying to conceive of a way to make a little shim that will allow irssi to connect to MUCKs...
00:32 +shabble: billnye: perhaps, I've never used them
00:32 +shabble: except to look at the code a bit
00:32 +MinceR: then you could use irssi to MUCK about
00:32 +shabble: Rask: you could suppress it with a script, if you wanted to
00:33 +billnye: http://tools.suckless.org/ii/
00:33 +Rask: shabble: Thought of that, but the issue I'm running up against is, I use the irssi proxy module (and love it), afraid that won't work for the clients I attach to it with...
00:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dunpeal]
00:33 +dunpeal: Hello from my newly compiled irssi 0.8.15!!1
00:34 +dunpeal: that was pretty freaking easy
00:35 +blip2: Client: irssi 0.8.12 :[
00:35 +blip2: silly debian
00:35 +billnye: Rask: the ^ syntax perhaps?
00:36 +Rask: billnye: You mean in interactive usage, prepend every line with "/^msg #channel "?
00:36 +dunpeal: blip2: build it yourself. all the cool kids do.
00:36 +dunpeal: I can haz spellcheck?!
00:36 +billnye: Rask: presumably you'd alias it to something more sensible but yes that's what I mean
00:36 +dunpeal: seriously, where's the spellchecker for irssi?
00:36 +billnye: dunpeal: http://scripts.irssi.org/ ?
00:37 +Rask: billnye: It'd work, but it wouldn't work in the clients I attach to the irssi proxy with, though, would it?
00:37 +dunpeal: billnye: omg, you mean I need perl for that?
00:38 +dunpeal: is the Python support functional at all?
00:38 +blip2: dunpeal: indeed - I'm just lazy
00:38 +shabble: can someone please shoot this person in the face?
00:38 +blip2: I build bitlbee myself cause it has better features
00:39 +shabble: blip2: also, fix tardis :P

00:47 +dunpeal: I'm starting to love irssi already

02:19 +ackthet: so, ctr-x ctr-c locks irssi (when i attempt to quit emacs in the wrong terminal...) is this an issue with irssi or with tmux maybe
02:19 +tsp: ackthet: What does it do if you try without tmux?
02:19 * ackthet tries
02:20 +ackthet: tsp: it locks
02:20 +tsp: ok then
02:20 +tsp: do you have to use ^x?, or does ^c lock it
02:21 +tsp: or ^x for that matter
02:22 +ackthet: tsp: looks like i lied, its ^x ^s
02:23 +ackthet: and actually just ^s
02:25 +tsp: ok
02:25 +tsp: easy fix, hit ^q

02:26 +tsp: ackthet: if you're not on a serial terminal or something like that, add stty -ixon -ixoff to your shell's init file
02:26 +tsp: then ^s ^q will act as normal and not stop output to your terminal
02:26 +ackthet: so, its actually a shell thing?
02:27 +zinx: it's a tty thing
02:28 +ackthet: fair enough

02:29 +marfin: and why is it trying to assign the address?
02:29 +Bazerka: you have a -host set for a network, or globally via /set hostname ?
02:30 +marfin: ah, yeah i have a host. >_<

02:33 +gryllida: 21:32:08 [freenode] gryllida [gryllida@support.team.at.shellium.org] requested CTCP PING from gryllida: 1

02:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Steve57]
02:37 +dunpeal: I mean a text search in one or more buffers.
02:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
02:42 +Slizzurd: dunpeal: like /laslog?
02:43 +Bazerka: gryllida: you should really use /ctcp <target> ping directly, as you need to pass it an accurate timestamp if you want an accurate response
02:44 +Bazerka: *shouldn't
02:44 +Bazerka: use /ping <target> instead (and irssi will send a valid ctcp ping with correct timestamp for you)
02:44 +Bazerka: s/accurate/meaningful/
02:45 +dunpeal: Bazerka: how do I ping the server?
02:45 +dunpeal: "/ping" in XChat
02:45 +dunpeal: Slizzurd: was wondering if there was something that gives more context.
02:46 +dunpeal: i.e. I'd like to get back to the point in the log where a substring "foo" occured, and be able to scroll backwards and forwards from there.
02:46 +Bazerka: server pings are typically restricted to opers
02:46 +dunpeal: Bazerka: while that may be, XChat allows it in some fashion.
02:46 +Bazerka: dunpeal: /run sb_search.pl and then /sb search [-forward] foo
02:51 +Bazerka: heh, xchat/windows certainly takes the piss
02:51 +Bazerka: requiring registration my arse.
02:52 +Bazerka: so I can't say what its /ping<cr> command actually does
02:53 +Slizzurd: You can compile it yourself or go with a free version, silverx ( kind of dated ) or xchat-wdk
02:53 +Bazerka: or I can just not bother wasting my time :)
02:53 +Slizzurd: lol true
02:54 +Slizzurd: What do you need to know about the ping command
02:55 +Bazerka: nothing, it's just occured to me that it's an ircd command anyways
02:55 +Bazerka: which the server will respond with a pong
02:56 +Bazerka: so I guess xchat wraps that up and returns the difference between teh two timestamps
02:56 +Slizzurd: Oh, well in xchat with a supplied option it will ctcp ping w/e you give it to ping
02:56 +Slizzurd: Just /ping will ping the server
02:56 +Bazerka: talking about without an option apparently
02:56 +Bazerka: yes
02:56 +Slizzurd: I see
02:57 +Bazerka: when I mentioned it being an oper command above, I was thinking of remote ping, not a local server ping
02:57 +Slizzurd: Shame on you
02:57 +Bazerka: it's a 2am, sue me :)

03:08 +m0ar: Hello! I'm trying to use nicklist.pl with fifo output, however it halts when starting irssi. "can't mkfifo ~/.irssi/nicklistfifo: No such file or directory"
03:08 +m0ar: How do I make it work?
03:09 +webvictim: have you got a ~/.irssi directory?
03:09 +m0ar: webvictim: Yes
03:09 +webvictim: (you most likely do)
03:09 +webvictim: is it writable?
03:09 +m0ar: Yes yes, I've been using irssi for years :)
03:10 +webvictim: have to check :P
03:10 +webvictim: sometimes it's the simple things
03:10 +m0ar: Yeah, of course
03:10 +webvictim: if you try and mkfifo manually, what happens?
03:10 +m0ar: webvictim: Well, how do I try?
03:10 +webvictim: mkfifo ~/.irssi/nicklistfifo
03:10 +webvictim: :P
03:10 +m0ar: Cannor create, file exists
03:11 +m0ar: Removed and reran, no errors
03:11 +webvictim: then in theory it should work if you follow the instructions
03:11 +m0ar: webvictim: Eh, what instructions?
03:12 +webvictim: in the script
03:12 +webvictim: on how to use it
03:12 +m0ar: webvictim: Oh, it actually has a readme
03:12 +webvictim: exactly :P
03:13 +m0ar: Oh well, it's a link :P
03:14 +m0ar: webvictim: Do you mind explaining what that "fifo" is?
03:14 +webvictim: it's short for "first in first out"
03:14 +webvictim: it's what they call a named pipe
03:15 +m0ar: webvictim: Okay, continue
03:15 +webvictim: basically you put data into it at one end and you can get it out at the other
03:15 +webvictim: it's a way of passing data out of screen to a script
03:15 +webvictim: as far as i can work out
03:15 +m0ar: Ah, that's more like it
03:15 +webvictim: and passing it back in again
03:15 +m0ar: Thanks
03:16 +m0ar: webvictim: Too bad that the screen mode works like crap :c
03:17 +webvictim: i tried it for a while and found it pretty awful
03:17 +webvictim: so i just learnt to live without a nicklist
03:17 +m0ar: webvictim: Hm. Doesn't work. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/286739/
03:18 +webvictim: after a little while it didn't bother me any more
03:18 +Bazerka: nicklists are overrated :)
03:18 +webvictim: just got used to typing /n
03:18 +m0ar: webvictim: Why not split screen and fifo?
03:18 +webvictim: i agree now :)
03:18 +webvictim: split screens are effort to manage
03:18 +m0ar: webvictim: Oh?
03:18 +m0ar: Anyhow, could you check the pase for me?

04:08 +azizLIGHTS: whats that?
04:09 +Bazerka: I'd say that is pretty self explanatory :)
04:09 +MJ94: webvictim: I have my network setup. How do I connect now?
04:09 +webvictim: /connect freenode
04:09 +webvictim: or whatever you called your network
04:09 +webvictim: my server is a bouncer, pretty much :P

04:10 +MJ94: Yes I did...
04:10 +MJ94: How do I check?
04:10 +webvictim: /network list
04:10 +webvictim: /server list
04:10 +webvictim: is also helpful
04:11 +MJ94: How do I delete servers?
04:12 +sud0:  /server remove []
04:17 +MJ94: I added a new autocmd. It looks like it overwrote one of my others, too.
04:17 +MJ94: Does it?
04:20 +MJ94: I can only add one autocmd.
04:22 +Dirm: mj -autosendcmd "command1;command2;command3"
04:23 +Dirm: oops, missed the tab key
04:23 +MJ94: Dirm: Can I add one autocommand one time, and another at another time?
04:23 +Dirm: nope
04:24 +MJ94: Sad.
04:25 +MJ94: Is there a way to get the window numbers to go in order by channel name?
04:25 +MJ94: Like #a = 1 #b = 2
04:26 +MJ94: Dirm: ^
04:26 +Bazerka: chansort.pl is one way of doing that
04:28 +webvictim: i tend to just manually reorder them and then save the layout
04:28 +webvictim: you can do /window move left, /window move right etc
04:29 +webvictim: . /window move 10
04:29 +webvictim: just shuffle them about until they're in the right order and then /layout save
04:29 +MJ94: Why won't /network add -autosend "^nick MJ94;^msg phpserv id mj94 pass" work?
04:29 +webvictim: autosendcmd
04:29 +webvictim: also you need to have a network name after it
04:31 +MJ94: Why won't /network add -autosendcmd "^nick MJ94;^msg phpserv id mj94 pass" work? ClueIRC
04:32 +MJ94: The /nick works, but not id
04:34 +MJ94: (webvictim Bazerka Dirm)
04:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Slizzurd]
04:35 +webvictim: well, you shouldn't be setting nick that way anyway.
04:36 +webvictim: /network add -nick MJ94 -autosendcmd "^msg phpserv id mj94 pass" clueirc
04:37 +MJ94: How do I delete the current autocmd I have now, then?
04:38 +webvictim: just reissue the command with the modified autosendcmd and same network name
04:38 +webvictim: it'll overwrite it
04:40 +MJ94: It's doing MJ94_
04:40 +MJ94: not MJ94
04:40 +MJ94: But I have it written right.
04:41 +MJ94: There.

04:47 +azizLIGHTS: how do i hide nick changes
04:48 +azizLIGHTS: or setting of +v
04:48 +azizLIGHTS: bbut not ban or kick
04:52 +Bazerka: MJ94: do you have a scripts directory to create an autorun directory in?
04:52 +Bazerka: if not, mkdir -p /home/mj94/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

05:01 +MJ94: Ugh. I'm so lost.
05:02 +MJ94: I have it in scripts/autorun.
05:02 +Bazerka: it needs to be in scripts
05:02 +MJ94: But I'd like to auto run them.
05:02 +Bazerka: yes, but you then symlink it into autorun
05:02 +Bazerka: see the top of http://scripts.irssi.org for instructions
05:04 +MJ94: cd ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ ; ln -s ../script.p where script.pl = scriptname?
05:05 +webvictim: ln -s ../script.pl script.pl
05:05 +webvictim: yeah

05:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v eboyjr]
05:24 +eboyjr: Let's say I found a bug in highlightwin.pl, what should I do with it after I fix it?
05:24 +chalk46: well, the alt+# keys are used for switching virtual desktops in my wm (dwm), so I'd like to make it somethign else
05:24 +chalk46: like control+alt, or winkey, or something
05:25 +chalk46: the alt keys also seem to want to be used to make unicode chars, so it just gets tangled
05:25 +billnye: chalk46: you probably have one alt (right?) as compose not alt
05:26 +chalk46: well there's two but they basically do the same thing
05:26 +chalk46: alt/ctrl/win/menu, one of those keyboards
05:26 +billnye: and you CAN rebind keys in irssi, but depending on what modifiers you can get the terminal program to recognize you're probably better off changing your wm mod key than your terminal meta
05:27 +billnye: in the mean time, esc,# sends the same signal as alt+# and isn't likely to step on anyone's toes
05:28 +chalk46: alright thanks
