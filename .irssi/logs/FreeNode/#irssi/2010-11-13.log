00:19 +inkjetunit: CIAO A TUTTI
00:20 +inkjetunit: i seem to have utf-8 issues with irssi. i'm always using a unicode capable terminal. could someone give a little advice with irssi settings?
00:20 +Dirm: /set term_charset utf-8
00:20 +Dirm: make sure screen is running with -U
00:21 +Dirm: make sure the output of the 'locale' command looks right
00:21 +inkjetunit: hmm. wth. my term_charset was set to 646

00:31 +Datz: ah, ok thanks

00:38 +fujisano: hello
00:38 +fujisano: how do i switch channels again in irssi?
00:38 +webvictim: alt+left/right or /window #
00:38 +fujisano: thanks
00:38 +webvictim: /window goto #irssi
00:38 +webvictim: etc
00:38 +fujisano: and on os x?
00:39 +webvictim: you can use esc+number
00:39 +fujisano: ty
00:39 +webvictim: there's an option in terminal.app for "use alt as meta key"
00:39 +webvictim: which will enable alt to work
00:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fujisano]
00:46 +fujisano: uhm my keyboard input isnt working properly i can only switch channels now with the /join #channel command
00:46 +fujisano: :'(
00:47 +Dirm: how about <esc>#
00:47 +fujisano: also not working
00:48 +sash_: is there a way to ignore hilights from everyone in a specific channel?
00:49 +webvictim: not easily
00:49 +webvictim: irssi has pretty awful support for highlight ignores
00:49 +sash_: freenode-spam shizzle is enerving me
00:49 +Dirm: freenode-spam doesn't sound like a very fun channel to be in :P
00:49 +webvictim: i think the clue might be in the "-spam" :P
00:49 +Dirm: how many hilights do you have?
00:50 +sash_: well, its spam in #freenode ;)
00:50 +Dirm: trigger.pl will do it
00:50 +Dirm: but it's not terribly pretty
00:51 +sash_: its just confusing if channels are yellow (because of the hilight)
00:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
00:51 +sash_: i know then taht its freenode, but i also know that if i am hilighted in freenode, its spam
00:52 +sash_: will have a look at trigger.pl. thx
00:53 +fujisano: ™™
00:53 +fujisano: thats what i get on alt+#
00:53 +fujisano: :/

01:03 +rlpowell: Is it possible for a script to create a not-actually-there channel?
