13:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v x73]
13:51 +idl0r: i just wonder because white bold works fine for channel messages like *this* but it's more grey in the window bar
13:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
13:59 +idl0r: s/grey/white/
14:00 +idl0r: so it seems to me that %W in a theme is normal white instead of white bold

14:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v thoas]
14:17 +idl0r: so what's the difference between *this* bold and %W? shouldn't it be the same?
14:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
14:18 +peth: idl0r: that's right, under 256color the old %W is now %W%_
14:20 +idl0r: yay, thanks :D

14:27 +Grey_Loki: Is there a way of batch-closing windows? Just got hit with some PM spam, wondering if I can say /window close 14-500 or something - that particular command doesn't work though :P
14:28 +desikitteh{G}{H}: Grey_Loki: if you find a way, let me know please.

14:31 +tmr: He almost got it, "/window close 14 500".

18:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Marchal]
18:49 +cgtdk: ***[...]any channels I cannot[...]
18:50 +deryni: What do you mean you can't go to it?
18:51 +cgtdk: I try to press Alt+1, but nothing happens
18:51 +leon-worldwide: cgtdk: i use CTRL+n until im in the status window
18:51 +cgtdk: Sorry if I am using incorrect terms
18:51 +cgtdk: leon: thanks, that worked :P
18:51 +cgtdk: as I said
18:51 +leon-worldwide: cgtdk: ESC and then 1 could work too
18:51 +cgtdk: I'm a newb
18:51 +deryni: Does alt-# work in general?
18:51 +cgtdk: deryni: yeah
18:51 +leon-worldwide: cgtdk: ESC+1 could also work
18:52 +cgtdk: ok
18:52 +cgtdk: anyway
18:52 +cgtdk: bye
18:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shammash]
18:53 * leon-worldwide didnt even know ALT+# existed. As it conflicts with "switch to tab #" in gnomes terminal emulator.
18:53 +MinceR: afaik only if you have more than one tab

18:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sshc]
18:59 +ds187: leon-worldwide: just remove the menu-bar via the view-menu and then alt-# works without any problem
19:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v janhouse]
19:07 +billnye: shammash: not /really/, but I bet there are ways to hack around it
19:08 +billnye: shammash: network name in the log path, screw permissions on the networks you don't want

19:13 +leon-worldwide: ds187: i dont have a menu bar in my gnome terminal. what i mean is that i use tabs in the gnome terminal and control them with alt+#.
19:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
19:13 +ds187: leon-worldwide: ah, ok, now i understood
