03:03 +infogulch: i used the --config and --home parameters on irssi.exe
03:04 +infogulch: but i'm not sure if they worked
03:04 +infogulch: is there a way to tell what dirs irssi is using from within irssi when it's started?
03:05 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 102 seconds
03:05 +mauke: /script exec print Irssi::get_irssi_dir()
03:06 +infogulch: cool thanks! it worked :)
03:07 +infogulch: how about the config dir?
03:07 +mauke: there is no config dir
03:08 +infogulch: oh it's a config file
03:22 +charitwo: how do i prevent -network from showing up in tabcomplete
03:25 +Godslastering: how do i enable non ascii character support, such as letters with accents...
03:25 +mauke: Godslastering: how is it not enabled?
03:26 +Godslastering: mauke: i mean, it's displaying funky characters that are doing odd things such as messing up my display when i input them. is this an OS issue here...?
03:26 +mauke: how are you running irssi?
03:26 +Godslastering: mauke: through screen through ssh
03:26 +mauke: ah, fun
03:27 +mauke: what does '/set term_charset' say?
03:27 +Godslastering: UTF-8
03:28 +mauke: so either screen or your terminal isn't configured to use utf-8
03:28 +Godslastering: I'm currently using PuTTy in windows as the ssh client, is the issue there, or with screen/the terminal?
03:29 +charitwo: let me explain, when i tab complete a name when it is not at the start of a line...it appends -freenode for example. how do i stop this?
03:29 +mauke: putty is your terminal
03:29 +charitwo: er, prepends
03:29 +Godslastering: mauke: screen by default should work with UTF-8, so i guess it's a putty issue?
03:30 +mauke: I don't know if screen defaults to UTF-8
03:30 +charitwo: Godslastering: when you first open putty, before opening a connection
03:30 +FauxFaux: It's quite easy to eliminate screen by /not using screen/.
03:30 +charitwo: change the charset under Appearance > Translation
03:30 +mauke: check your putty settings, "Translation"
03:31 +Godslastering: FauxFaux: and not leave my connection open all the time?
03:31 +FauxFaux: No, while testing.
03:32 +Godslastering: charitwo: ah that seemed to be the issue
03:32 +Godslastering: thankya sir
03:32 +infogulch: isn't there an ssl option when adding a server?
03:33 +Godslastering: -ssl
03:33 +charitwo: you're welcome...now how do i fix my tab complete issue? lol
03:33 +infogulch:  /facepalm
03:40 +Ticho: you don't fix your tab complete issue, your tab complete issue fixes you
04:10 +charitwo: Ticho: not helpful, when i am issuing commands to services that involve other users, this tab complete issues results in an erroneous command
04:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v diddly]
04:20 +infogulch: gah how can i keep irssi from trying to connect ever 10 seconds ! D:<

04:28 +infogulch: ok
04:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v loadedwithwyrms]
04:41 +Ziber: So, my latest irssi problem is hilighting... I'm trying to make a hilight script that hilights a message if it contains your nickname (with spaces around it - I made a perl sub to match it against a nice little regex I constructed). I have a feeling that this would be better as another source patch, though.
04:47 +tmr: Script to hilight, why?
04:47 +deryni: /help hilight ?
04:47 @Dirm: /hilight can't handle your current nick
04:47 @Dirm: you have to hardcode e.g. /hilight Dirm
04:47 +deryni: Ah.
04:47 @Dirm: more like hilight_nick_matches, which acts on your current nick
04:47 @Dirm: I'm guessing
04:48 +tmr: Well, that's only issue if you constantly change nick..
04:48 +Ziber: I use a different nickname on a few servers
04:48 +Ziber: and hilight_nick_matches, afaik, will hilight me when "liberal" is typed, if my nickname is Liber, which it is, on most servers.
04:48 +mauke: (?<!\S)\Q$nick\E(?!\S)
04:49 +mauke: there's the regex
04:49 @Dirm: yeah and hilight_nick_matches only works for lines that start with it
04:50 +Ziber: id like to be hilighted if my nickname (and not "liberal", "liberty", etc) is said.
04:50 +Ziber: anywhere in a line.
04:55 +Ziber: any ideas?

We use our own irc plugin for a communicator, but something got messed and it won't show userlist. So I'd like to add !nicks funcionality to a bot.

20:28 +PequeNiTo: I'm moderating an 700+ users channel on another network, and I needed to personalize my bans, each according to each rule break. How can I set up some quick personalized kickbanning alias without breaking my neck? I have no previous experience in coding any irssi.
20:29 +Death4Li1e: you can use /alias to create aliases for each
20:30 +PequeNiTo: Hm, okay. That's in the config file?
20:31 +Remco: That would be /help alias
20:32 +Remco: And of course /help ban
20:32 +Death4Li1e: no need for editing the config file :)
20:33 +Death4Li1e: /alias englishplz ban $0 Please talk nothing but english
20:33 +Death4Li1e: like that I suppose :p
20:34 +PequeNiTo: Oh, I see. Yeah, that's sorta the guidance I was lookin' for :)

20:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v caemir]
20:35 +NCS_One: I have set autolog on but it doesn't log, what could be wrong?
20:37 +PequeNiTo: It works, guys! Thank you very much, Remco && Death4Li1e
20:38 +PequeNiTo: :)
20:38 +billnye: NCS_One: it's possible that it DOES log, and it just hasn't yet
20:38 +billnye: (logging is buffered, so it's not instant-instant)
20:39 +NCS_One: billnye: I tryed quitting irssi
20:39 +NCS_One: damme
20:39 +NCS_One: now its logging
20:41 +NCS_One: before I have set the autolog_path to ~/.irclogs/$tag/$0-%Y-%m-%d.log
20:41 +NCS_One: could the "." file be the issue?
20:41 +NCS_One: now autolog_path is to ~/irclogs/$tag/$0-%Y-%m-%d.log
20:42 +billnye: NCS_One: the other logs are probably in .irclogs
20:42 +NCS_One: billnye: they aren't
20:45 +NCS_One: and another thing, in autolog_path I have $0-%Y-%m-%d.log but the files are e.g. #irssi IRCnet2011-01-12.log

21:08 +Zed`: is there a way to stop a command like ctrl-c in irssi - for example a /lastlog gone stupid?
21:09 +vague`: You can /server purge, can't think of anything else.
21:10 +billnye: if you're in screen, close the terminal and reopen it
21:10 +Zed`: why would that work?
21:10 +billnye: the biggest lag is usually on the end-display
21:11 +billnye: or seems that way any time I've been so fortunate as to inflict those things on myself
21:11 +Zed`: hrm
21:12 +billnye: if you can get a detach in edgewise, it should go back to displaying at "local" speed, done in time for your reconnect
21:12 +billnye: (is my thought process)
21:12 +Zed`: I was thionking that deatching would have no effect at all on irssi
21:13 +billnye: my thought is that the majority of the delay may not lie with irssi
21:14 +Zed`: well perhaps I was not clear
21:14 +Zed`: irssi was actually working fine
21:14 +Zed`: I did a /ll (somthing stupud like 'the') and so the output was a million lines
21:14 +Zed`: I wanted to stop it rather than wait
21:15 +billnye: in that case "change windows for a second then change back" would probably be the equivalent to my earlier suggestion, with just as little certainty that it'd help and just as little consequence for "failure" :)
21:16 +billnye: as vague`s comment implied, I'm not aware of anything "break"-equivalent for commands within irssi itself not /execs or incoming/outgoing server queues
21:16 +Zed`: heh :)
21:16 +Zed`: yeah
21:16 +Zed`: that makes sense
21:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Cy-4]
21:20 +NCS_One: is there a way I can see the Special Variables and Expandos on irssi?
21:20 +Bazerka: http://www.irssi.org/documentation/special_vars
21:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CEnTR4L]
21:23 +NCS_One: Bazerka: yes, I have seen that. But e.g. what is $0   ?
21:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v caemir]
21:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
21:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v janhouse]
21:41 --- jordan.freenode.net sets modes [#irssi +v edenc]
21:41 +Bazerka: $n        expands to argument 'n' passed to an alias (counting from zero)
21:41 +Bazerka: so $0 is the first argument
21:45 +NCS_One: so if I set autolog_path to ~/irclogs/$tag/$0-%Y-%m-%d.log    what is the $0  ?
21:45 +NCS_One: I'm getting - #irssi IRCnet2011-01-12.log
21:49 +Bazerka: $0 is the "target" - ie, the channel (or nickname if it's a query)
21:50 +Bazerka: eg, here may be ~/irclogs/freenode/#irssi-2011-01-12.log
21:50 +NCS_One: so why is the log file name different from what I set on autolog_path?
21:51 +Bazerka: what exactly is the output of /set autolog_path
21:51 +Bazerka: and have you changed it without restarting?
21:51 +Bazerka: the autolog_path is only used at log opening time
21:51 +Bazerka: if you change it after a log is opened, it won't be used until the next time that log is opened
21:51 +NCS_One: autolog_path = ~/irclogs/$tag/$0-%Y-%m-%d.log
21:52 +ferret: What exactly is your complaint?
21:52 +Bazerka: which version of irssi?
21:52 +Bazerka: ferret: apparently that the filename produced by that path is "#irssi IRCnet2011-01-12.log"
21:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
21:52 +NCS_One: irssi 0.8.14 (20090728 1938)
21:53 +Bazerka: which doesn't make much sense at all :)
21:53 +ferret: that seems unlikely
21:53 +Bazerka: idd
21:53 +ferret: it doesn't even contain the correct number of hyphens
21:53 +ferret: unless it is reading $0- as a single token meaning $0 onwards
21:54 +Bazerka: even then, that doesn't explain why $tag and $0 are inverted
21:54 +NCS_One: at first I was trying to set autolog_path to ~/.irclogs/$tag/$0-%Y-%m-%d.log (".") and it didnt log
21:54 +ferret: maybe you should try  ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.%Y-%m-%d.log
21:55 +ferret: Bazerka: they're not inverted
21:55 +ferret: $0- is in this case the same as $0 $1
21:55 +Bazerka: #irssi == $0, IRCnet == $tag
21:56 +ferret: IRCnet is $1
21:56 +NCS_One: going to try it, back in a sec
21:56 +Bazerka: is that fact or supposition? (I don't know as I haven't looked into it yet)
21:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v NCS_One]
21:57 +Bazerka: although it does seem plausible - I mean if it's doing expando expansion, it would process $0-
21:58 +Bazerka: so I'd try ~/irclogs/$tag/$0\-%Y-%m-%d.log
21:58 +NCS_One: with ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.%Y-%m-%d.log its working
21:59 +NCS_One: going to try it
22:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v NCS_One]
22:01 +NCS_One: wainting for it to start logging
22:01 +Bazerka: just /log
22:01 +Bazerka: the expandos are expanded there
22:02 +Bazerka: although yes, it's a good idea to see what file irssi actually creates :)
22:02 +NCS_One: when I do /log its ok but there is no file
22:03 +Bazerka: does it show the \- in /log?
22:03 +NCS_One: no
22:03 +Bazerka: just ..foobar-2011...
22:03 +Bazerka: ?
22:04 +NCS_One: yes
22:04 +Bazerka: k, I guess I'll need to look into that then

22:10 +yitz_: NCS_One: Stop logging, move the directory and change the setting and start logging again
22:12 +Bazerka: you've put a space at the beginning of autolog_path's value
22:12 +Bazerka: so it is literally writing to " ~/foobar" instead of expanding ~
22:12 +NCS_One: oh
22:12 +NCS_One: you are right
22:13 +NCS_One: it had to be something I had done :)
22:13 +Bazerka: so, it was writing correctly with the \- in the path?
22:14 +Bazerka: just not where you expected?
22:14 +NCS_One: yes
22:14 * Bazerka takes it back off the list
22:14 +Bazerka: cool :)
