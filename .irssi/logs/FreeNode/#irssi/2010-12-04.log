14:42 +djszapi: Can I make notes about a buddy and ask for those information somehow in irssi ? It would help a lot if I should not ask the same questions again and again from time to time ?
14:46 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nhandler]
14:47 +rudi_s: djszapi: Why not just use a txt file and put the notes there ..
14:48 +djszapi: because it is more pain in the ass.
14:48 +rudi_s: djszapi: ... why?
14:48 +djszapi: than just write /notes in the current chat window...
14:49 +rudi_s: AFAIK there's no such script, but you could write one easily, I still don't get the point. Because adding/editing the notes gets painful in irssi.
14:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lysanderslair]
14:50 +djszapi: my version: 1) notes -> we are ready. your version 2) go different terminal window or tab, find the file, open the file, grok the information from a large database...
14:50 +mauke: that's not what "grok" means
14:50 +rudi_s: djszapi: Well, my version, ^a 2, /name<enter>, done.
14:51 +mauke: also, what large database?
14:51 +rudi_s: True, a little longer, but editing is simpler and you can use your editor of choice.
14:51 +djszapi: +rudi_s: so you handle all the regexp right ?
14:51 +djszapi: about the namestuff ?
14:51 +mauke: what regexp?
14:51 +rudi_s: djszapi: Regex? Namestuff?
14:51 +djszapi: come on, it would be just one command...
14:51 +mauke: what nmes?
14:51 +djszapi: yes...
14:51 +rudi_s: It's just a nick.
14:51 +mauke: what nick?
14:51 +rudi_s: /djszapi
14:51 +djszapi: - /namehello - /namehelloworld
14:52 +djszapi: you do not want to find helloworld.
14:52 +mauke: so far we're only talking about "/notes"
14:52 +rudi_s: mauke: I thought he wanted notes about nicks.
14:52 +mauke: now it gets complicated
14:52 +djszapi: no someone mentioned a very strange idea about separate text files...
14:52 +mauke: djszapi: no, a single text file called "notes"
14:52 +djszapi: which is a pain in the ass. Ideal solution /note list/edit
14:52 +mauke: and "/notes" would be just "cat notes"
14:53 +mauke: oh, now it's not only nicks but also "list" and "edit"
14:53 +bremner: djszapi: perhaps you should start writing this tool since no-one else seems too motivted.
14:54 +djszapi: that is the answer for my question. "No builtin option yet".
14:56 +sneep: /notes djszapi Do not ask this person for coding ideas
14:56 +sneep: Oops
14:56 +bremner:  /notes sneep smartass
14:56 +bremner: ;)
14:57 +djszapi: I can write if you pay me or some company pay me, otherwise my leisure time is for my family and friends.
14:58 +bremner: wait. You want us to pay you to write the thing that only you want?
14:58 +bremner: good luck with that.
14:58 +bremner:  /notes djszapi optimist
14:59 +djszapi: please do not force me for coding, I am addult, I can decide whether I need a feature enough or not in my leisure time.

17:01 +Maxdamantus: Hm, just wondering.. is it possible to get the input line attached to the "window", rather than the "screen"?
17:02 +Maxdamantus: So if I have two windows visible, the input will be just below the one that's active, so I don't keep replying to things in the wrong channel.

17:50 +dayanandpc: doesn`t come up on goole

17:51 +tmr: mauke, goole or Google?
17:51 +mauke: google :-)
17:52 +dayanandpc: not want i want :) I just want to get away from the terminal . I`m using irssi
17:52 +dayanandpc: xchat also hangs
17:52 +dayanandpc: smuxi doesn`t open
17:52 +tmr: Try xirssi then.
17:53 +xand: if you want to "get away from the terminal" why would you choose irssi?
17:53 +dayanandpc: this is the only client that works for me right now
17:53 +dayanandpc: :(
17:53 +tmr: xand, lack of decent gui irc clients perhaps? :)
17:54 +dayanandpc: i think so
17:54 +tmr: dayanandpc, http://svn.irssi.org/repos/xirssi/trunk/
17:54 +xand: it's a strength of irssi that it's a cli program... you can run it in screen
17:56 +dayanandpc: does it support mutiple servers?
17:57 +dayanandpc: and how do i join them>
17:57 +tmr: Should work same way as irssi, http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c3
