13:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v scoobert1on]
13:19 +cyraxx: moobar: did you reconnect after changing them?
13:19 +cyraxx: they are only transmitted to the server once after connecting
13:19 +moobar: cyraxx: Ohhh
13:20 +moobar: cyraxx: Is there anyway to update them without reconnecting?
13:20 +cyraxx: not that i know of
13:20 +cyraxx: actually, i'm pretty sure there isn't
13:21 +tmr: Only if you code server with unstandard extension and irssi support for that.
13:21 +moobar: Or maybe there's another attribute I can edit. Let me explain what I'm trying to do. We're using IRC to collaborate work, and we'd like our info to refelct what we're working on. At the moment we just change our nick. So, bob_proj1, john_proj3 and so on. I'd like to change this to have the info reflected elsewhere, and I was thinking we could change our real_name or user_name attributes.

13:23 +moobar: tmr: It's an internal IRC server, so I can modify it, if you could advise me?

13:25 +moobar: How do I do that?
13:25 +moobar: ah
13:27 * moobar Googles
13:28 +Death4Li1e: you could also use away and put the project as away reason :P
13:29 +moobar: Death4Li1e: Ah, that's a nice idea too :)
13:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dhruvasagar]
13:30 +Death4Li1e: a lot simpler as well :p
13:30 +moobar: Yeah I think I'll try that
13:30 +moobar: Then going to modify nicklist.pl to list users' away messages in the sidebar
13:31 +moobar: So bob chats, but his nick is listed as bob_proj1
13:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v scoobert1on]

13:44 +Flyoc: Death4Li1e: you cannot change your host while you are connected
13:44 +Death4Li1e: yes you can
13:44 +Death4Li1e: with hostserv
13:44 +Death4Li1e: or as ircop :p
13:44 +Flyoc: yeah well this is out of the IRC RFC
13:45 +Death4Li1e: but it might be a solution to his problem...

19:02 +billnye: huh? :)
19:02 +remybuntu: I was going to sync my config between two different computers (with two different OS's) using dropbox.
19:02 +imMute: remybuntu: no, sorry
19:03 +remybuntu: So I should probably just make a second config then
19:03 +imMute: yup
19:04 +billnye: remybuntu: what parts of your config need to depend on where you are?
19:04 +billnye: seems like if you don't want them to be the same then at least part of the motivation for sync are lost :D
19:05 +tmr: Probably hostnames, possibly servers.
19:05 +remybuntu: billnye: Theres a few plugins that load that are kind of mac specific. So when I launch irssi in linux with my config it throws out a ton of errors
19:06 +billnye: remybuntu: 'kinda plugins?
19:06 +tmr: Scripts?
19:06 +remybuntu: Yeah, thats what I mean.
19:06 +billnye: scripts or modules are outside the config proper in most cases
19:07 +billnye: (and the launching thereof)
19:07 +bburhans: if you want to sync all your scripts with dropbox you can do so, and just add an OS check at the beginning of all those OS-dependent scripts
19:07 +remybuntu: But aren't they initiated in the config?
19:07 +bburhans: remybuntu: no, if they're in autorun they'll run
19:07 +billnye: remybuntu: not when done properly
19:07 +tmr: Or just dont sync autorun dir.
19:07 +remybuntu: Ahhh. Ok
19:07 +remybuntu: I totally forgot about that
19:08 +billnye: as with many things there's some leeway on "properly", but in this case the standard intended method is also the most helpful to your needs, yes :)
19:10 +Remco: I'd say create a basic config with all servers configured, but not on autoconnect
19:10 +Remco: Then use a script to detect the host and connect accordingly
19:10 +billnye: well, question one... are these different computers connected simultaneously, or is it a mutually exclusive situation?
19:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Barlow_]
19:11 +remybuntu: billnye: I guess sometimes they'd both be connected simultaneously.
19:13 +tmr: I was thinking from shared shell machine point of view, this smells more like home use now..?
19:13 +remybuntu: It would be for home use. I don't use irssi over ssh that much
19:15 +remybuntu: All I'm trying to do is keep my .irssi directory consistent across two different OS's
19:15 +Koffa: irssi's config should support includes...
19:16 +tmr: Just exclude autorun dir and your set, if you use symlinks you only need to upgrade scripts on one machine.
19:16 +remybuntu: tmr: Yep. Thats what I'm trying now
