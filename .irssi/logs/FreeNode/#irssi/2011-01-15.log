04:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v loadedwithwyrms]
04:12 +MystX: From what I can tell, the message public spits out $server, $msg, $nick, $address, $target. But I'm not sure how to check the access level of $nick
04:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v quotemstr]

04:25 +quotemstr: Is erssi actually written in Perl?
04:25 +quotemstr: irssi, rather.
04:25 +shabble: no
04:25 +shabble: it just has a perl scripting interface
04:25 +MystX: Im terrible at perl =\
04:25 +quotemstr: That's the other option.

04:28 +quotemstr: shabble: I've never lived in Emacs.
04:28 +quotemstr: Especially since Cygwin fork is so ungodly slow.
04:29 +quotemstr: A fork of bash takes 100ms.
04:29 +quotemstr: But because Emcas is so much larger, and because Cygwin copies the entire address space, an Emacs fork takes over a second.
04:29 +quotemstr: A whole second! Using external programs from Emacs is painful.
04:29 +quotemstr: I eventually need to hack in posix_spawn support --- but I'm getting off-topic.

08:28 +tmr: If you have some more specific questions after going trough that, ask away.

08:29 +tmr: http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#3
08:29 +paul__: I've looked through that documentation but it kinda confuses, I will cite something from there that confuses me if I can descrive it right
08:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v droidfrog]
08:30 +paul__: is irssi supposed to work like screen kinda?
08:31 +mauke: what
08:31 +tmr: Umm.. No, screen is terminal emulator/multiplexer, irssi is irc client.
08:31 +paul__: I mean in splitting screens and shifting through them and what not
08:31 +paul__: lol
08:32 +tmr: You can split windows vertically and have multiple windows, sure.
08:34 +paul__: how do I name my network I added?
08:34 +mauke: /network add yournamehere
08:35 +mauke: how did you add a network without naming it?
08:35 +paul__: i supposed i didn't add a network just a name
08:35 +paul__: i did /network add irc.freenode.net
08:35 +mauke: congratulations, you have a network named "irc.freenode.net"
08:36 +paul__: yes, so how do I assign the actual address to it? The documentation is says "First you need to have your IRC network set, use /NETWORK commnd to see if it's already there. If it isn't, use /network add yournetwork"
08:37 +mauke: there is no actual address
08:37 +mauke: you add servers to the network
08:37 +mauke: see /server add, etc
08:38 +paul__: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
08:38 +paul__: now I see
08:38 +tmr: You can have multiple servers in your "irc.freenode.net" network.
08:38 +paul__: i seeeee, is there some way to rename that network?
08:39 +paul__: i fucking love tab completion with the names btw

10:33 +ustun: hi, I have just installed irssi, no configurations so far. I have connected to freenode, and connect to a few chat rooms. However, all the messages go to the first window, status window.
10:33 +sneep: Including this message?
10:33 +ustun: Why is that? Is that really the default? I had tried irssi a few years ago, and had given up due to this. (I thought there was a problem with my machine, but now I have installed in a different machine, and the same problem persists.)
10:34 +ustun: yes
10:34 +tmr: It's not default behaviour.
10:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
10:34 +ustun: actually, I tried setting status window off
10:34 +ustun: now all the other chat rooms messages go into #irssi window
10:34 +tmr: SOunds like you ran MANUAL-WIN alias.
10:34 +ustun: For example, I am seeing #debian messages at the moment.
10:35 +ustun: Also, every message is prepended with PRIVMSG
10:35 +ustun: and I can't even see your name : )
10:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v gemelen]
10:36 +tmr: You have really messed up setup then..
10:37 +ustun: In the status bar, I see freenode:#irssi(+Pcgnt) if that helps anything.
10:37 +ustun: 0.8.15
10:37 +ustun: 20100403
10:38 +sneep: You sure youdind't touch the config at all?
10:38 +tmr: Or it's possible that your irssi packager/sysadmin has determited that irssi does things wrong™ by default and decided to change default behaviour.
10:38 +sneep: I just /ver'd yu and didn't get a response
10:38 +ustun: What does /ver'd you mean?
10:38 +tmr: Prolly /ctcp ustun version
10:38 +sneep: It means I sent a CTCP version requst
10:39 +ustun: This is not my registered freenode name.
10:39 +ustun: can it be the culprit?
10:39 --- ustun is now known as ustunozgur
10:39 +tmr: ctcp has nothing to do with freenode accounts.
10:39 +sneep: What dstro are you using?
10:40 +ustunozgur: It is ubuntu, 10.10.
10:40 +sneep: (Also, sorry fo he crappy typing)
10:40 +ustunozgur: But I had seen this in Debian too before.
10:40 +tmr: ustunozgur, I recommend that you close irssi, move ~/.irssi dir to somewhere else and start again.
10:40 +ustunozgur: something in my setup should be triggering this.
10:40 +ustunozgur: ok, let me try.
10:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ustunozgur]
10:42 +tmr: How are things now?
10:43 +ustunozgur: Still the same. My steps: Deleted .irssi folder. Started up irssi
10:43 +ustunozgur: connect irc.freenode.net
10:43 +ustunozgur: then join #irssi
10:43 +ustunozgur: messages go into 1st window
10:43 +ustunozgur: I am now typing into the 3rd window, irssi window.
10:43 +tmr: You are using default Ubuntu package?
10:43 +ustunozgur: But your messages go into 1st window
10:43 +ustunozgur: yes yes everything default
10:44 +ustunozgur: I am seeing your messages as PRIVMSG #irssi message content
10:44 +ustunozgur: 0.8.15

10:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v WonTu]

10:45 +sneep: Rename or delete /etc/irssi.conf and try again
10:45 +ustunozgur: OK, let me try that
10:46 +sneep: Does irssi copy /etc/irssi.conf toto ~/.irssi/config when there is no ~/.irssi?
10:46 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ustunozgur]
10:46 +sneep: toto=to
10:47 +sneep: Still the same?

10:50 +ustuntmp: still the same with a new user I guess.
10:51 +sneep: That is weird, ustuntmp
10:52 +tmr: Something is really broken, I would try to remove irssi package including pruning all config files in /etc and install again.
10:52 +ustuntmp: Last time, I had even compiled the latest version from scratch.
10:53 +tmr: Hmm...
10:53 +tmr: What 'type irssi' in your shell says?
10:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ustun]
10:53 +ustun: ok, I will try that too.
10:57 +ustun: I have now connected from my other computer at the university; and things seem to be normal.
10:57 +ustun: The distro there is Ubuntu 10.10 too
10:57 +ustun: The difference is, on my uni comp, it says "Found your hostname"
10:58 +ustun: when I connect to freenode
10:58 +ustun: On my home pc, it says "Checking ident, no ident response"
10:58 +ustun: "Could not look up hostname"
10:58 +ustun: can it be due to some nat issue then? I am behind an adsl modem at home.
10:59 +ustun: sorry, it says no ident response in both, but on one, it can find the hostname.
10:59 +ustun: On the other, it can't.
11:00 +sneep: That doesn't matter
11:00 +ustun: For example, I can see your name now, on my university computer.
11:01 +tmr: Yeah, you missing reverse at home is irrelevant.
11:02 +sneep: What did 'type irssi' output BTW?
11:02 +tmr: At your home machine.
11:03 +ustun: on both, /usr/bin/irssi
11:03 +ustun: Both the same version.
11:03 +tmr: And you're starting irssi with plain 'irssi' command?
11:03 +ustun: Yes.
11:05 +tmr: ustun, try removing irssi pkg, delete /etc/irssi.conf if it's left behing and then install irssi again.
11:05 +tmr: Behind even..
11:05 +ustun: OK, let me try.
11:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ustunhome]
11:08 +ustun: still no go.
11:10 +ustun: anyway, I will use my university computer then. Thanks, everyone.
11:11 +tmr: ustun, I'm still curious why that would happen, could you upload your /etc/irssi.conf somewhere?
11:11 +ustun: aha, I think I found something.
11:12 +tmr: Or ~/.irssi/config rather, make sure there's no private info in first though..
11:12 +ustun: I have found a bug report by a Turkish user, whose locale is TR.
11:12 +ustun: On my uni comp, locale is English
11:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ustun_]
11:12 +tmr: Oh, do you use UTF-8 locale?
11:13 +ustun_: OK, fixed now with starting irssi with LC_ALL=C irssi
11:14 +ustun: search for debian bug 376090
11:14 +ustun: sorry, I don't know how to copy/paste bt. tty's.

11:14 +mauke: with the mouse usually
11:15 +tmr: Use screen/tmux copy mode or mouse if you have gpm running.
11:16 +ustun_: OK, thanks.

13:52 +SanguineAnomaly: Hi, I was wondering if there was a nice way of making irssi hilight my nick, (not just a word which is the same as my current nick), no matter where it appears on a line?
13:53 +rudi_s: SanguineAnomaly: /help hilight, -line should do that.
13:53 +mauke: I don't think there is a way
13:53 +SanguineAnomaly: rudi_s: well, I've been looking, but I can't see a way of making it use my nick?
13:54 +SanguineAnomaly: I tried using $N, but that didn't work :(
13:54 +rudi_s: SanguineAnomaly: Use your nick? Just use it "SanguineAnomaly".
13:54 +rudi_s: I don't think it can do that for changing nicks automatically.
13:54 +SanguineAnomaly: rudi_s: but I use different nicks on different servers - for example I use Anomaly on quakenet, and so when I'm on Freenode, I get lots of other hilights too
13:55 +mauke: > my nick, (not just a word which is the same as my current nick)
13:55 +SanguineAnomaly: I was hoping there was a way to avoid that, but if not then nevermind :<
13:55 +rudi_s: SanguineAnomaly: Hm, looks like this is a problem.
13:56 +rudi_s: There's -channel, but there doesn't seem to be a -network option.
13:57 +SanguineAnomaly: hmm, alright
13:57 +SanguineAnomaly: thanks anyway :)
13:57 +rudi_s: np

15:21 +Death4Li1e: ^ screws up my irssi :<
15:22 +mauke: seems to work here
15:22 +Death4Li1e: my clock turned the other way around
15:22 +Death4Li1e: the timestamp*
15:22 +Death4Li1e: and it seems to have copy pasted better
15:23 +spb: right-to-left text does strange things to some terminals
15:24 +Death4Li1e: indeed

16:18 +iElectri1: http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/mygoogle.pl
16:18 +mauke: changed     => '13-03-04 01:35',
16:19 +mauke: well, fuck you too, timvw--
16:20 +iElectri1: yup:)
16:21 +iElectri1: mauke: why the bad words?
16:21 +mauke: what the hell kind of timestamp is that?
16:21 +iElectri1: some reverse polish notation:P
16:22 +mauke: in a few years it'll be completely ambiguous
16:22 +iElectri1: anyway, it would rock if someone updated it and used proper api for querying
16:22 +iElectri1: I can lend my python skills:)

23:43 +Smiley: but I can't see how :(
23:43 +Smiley: i just want them to save as #channelName
