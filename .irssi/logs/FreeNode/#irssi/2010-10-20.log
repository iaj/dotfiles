05:18 +yitz_: /connect
05:18 +yitz_: vs /server
05:19 +xev-: yitz_: if I use /server irc.any.org
05:19 +xev-: I dc from connection?
05:19 +yitz_: Then it disconnects your current server
05:19 +xev-: no, I dont want.
05:19 +yitz_: vs /connect which gives a new connection

05:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v WBC]
05:51 +WBC: Hey, is there a way to change the default kick message? /kick nick goes "-!- testa was kicked from #test by userrr [userrr]" - I want it to kick them with the message "kicked", or similar. Is it possible?
05:52 +yitz_: /kick user message
05:52 +WBC: I mean I want "message" to be automatic
05:52 +WBC: possible?
05:53 +deryni: Alias?
05:53 +WBC: would that be the only way?
05:53 +deryni: Not sure.
05:53 +yitz_: Maybe format?
05:53 +Dirm: or a script
05:53 +WBC: I still want to use /kick, not have to use some other command, ya know?
05:53 +WBC: :x
05:53 +Dirm: you can alias kick to itself
05:54 +Dirm: /alias kick kick $0 this is my message
05:54 +Dirm: though it's not quite perfect since you won't be able to do /kick #foo bob as you can with the 'real' kick
05:54 +Dirm: actually, I'm not sure how /kick parses its arguments
05:54 +Dirm: it says it takes <nicks> but also [<reason>]
05:54 +Dirm: not sure how it can tell where one ends and the next begins
05:54 +WBC: ah really? awesome ill try it
05:55 +deryni: Right, you'd need to use //kick or whatever to get the non-alias behaviour.
05:55 +WBC: 23:55:10 -!- WBC was kicked from ##hfhfhfh by WBC [this is my message]
05:55 +WBC: cooool
05:55 +deryni: The help text uses the singular 'user'.
05:56 +WBC: that works fine
05:56 +WBC: im surprised there is no /set for it
05:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jayne]
05:57 +yitz_: /kick user message
05:58 +yitz_: I said that -_-
05:58 +yitz_: The default reason is probably a /format
05:58 +deryni: Why would the default outgoing message be in a format?
05:58 +yitz_: Where else would it be?
05:59 +WBC: im not talking client-side bro
05:59 +yitz_: Oh. nvm
05:59 * yitz_ facepalms
05:59 +WBC: it happens :)
06:00 +WBC: Day changed to 20 Oct 2010
06:00 +WBC: hm
06:00 +WBC: that means I should be sleeping.
06:04 +yitz_: Yup!
06:05 +Steve57: at night? what a bizarre idea :p
06:08 +Zed`: so yitz_ I thought of a new feature
06:08 +yitz_: Oh?
06:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jayne]
06:08 +Zed`: /ack_set_toggle = #chan1 #chan2 etc
06:09 +Zed`: so you can just act between a couple chans without having to set act hide
06:10 +yitz_: And the others would never get selected?
06:14 +Zed`: correct, till you turn it off
06:14 +Zed`: like when you just want to toggle between two chans
06:15 +yitz_: The priority does that, sorta...
06:15 +yitz_: So, if those channels had no activity and the other channels did, /ack would do nothing?
06:15 +Zed`: I was watching the Yankees on tivo and I kept hittly my twitter window and learning the score before I got there
06:15 +Zed`: yitz_: correct
06:16 +yitz_: I'll see if I can pull that off tomorrow
06:16 +yitz_: This'd by a list of channel names or ref numbers?
06:16 +Zed`: either
06:17 +yitz_: Yeah. I can do that. Minor mod on the priority code.
06:18 +Zed`: nice
06:18 +Zed`: :))

09:13 +oxicarus: guys, cmd 'date +%W' returns current week of the year. now, is it possible to have irssi fetch it and eg. print it in channel, using a single oneliner-isch? =o somelike like /eval $exec(date +%W) ,,although that doesnt work ;P I have no clue on syntax, or if its even possible. give me a hint, anyone? ;P
09:15 +krisfremen: 42
09:15 +oxicarus: you made it work :)
09:15 +oxicarus: how did you do
09:15 +krisfremen: /exec -o date +%W
09:15 +oxicarus: brilliant, all i needed, ty alot :)
09:15 +krisfremen: you're welcome
09:16 +spike_: anyone know how to solve my problem?
09:16 +spike_: is electricelf around? he is the user that created my theme.
09:16 +vague`: spike_, how do you want to change it?
09:16 +Zmx: spike_: which nick mode ?
09:17 +spike_: i want the nickmodes to be displayed right before the nick name
09:17 +vague`: The usermode, he's using nm.pl and the usermode is off to the left
09:17 +spike_: sort of like in (don't hate me for this) weechat
09:17 +spike_: yeah, i know nm.pl can do it
09:17 +spike_: but nm.pl messes up a lot of my theme. like nick aligning
09:17 +vague`: spike_, that can't be done. But you can place the usermode -after- the nick.
09:18 +spike_: hmm

09:37 +zmx: I can manualy switch the configuration, but don't want to close irssi
09:37 +ds187: why don't you just use two windows in scrren?
09:37 +ds187: screen even
09:38 +zmx: because I want the same irssi instance.
09:38 +zmx: I start talking here with you on my PC. (with color, nick align, etc...)
09:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
09:39 +zmx: Then I move to my smartphone, ssh => Screen. But With the small resolution, I don't want nick align on it (for example)
09:39 +zmx: I want different shortcut, too.
09:39 +zmx: (but always the same irssi instance)
09:40 +ds187: how about an irc client on your smartphone? ;-)
09:41 +zmx: I can't have my awaylog, opened channel/query with an another irc client
09:41 +ds187: then you turn on irssi-proxy and connect via irc.app
09:41 +ds187: sure....i have it here
09:41 +ds187: irssi --> irssi-proxy --> znc --> rooms(iphone)
09:42 +ds187: i put the znc in there, because irssi-proxy doesn't provide a backlog, but znc does
09:42 +zmx: So, i can have two irssi (client), one irssi (proxy) on my server :D
09:43 +ds187: then you would just need one irssi instance with irssi-proxy turned on
09:43 +ds187: you can access it vie ssh/scrren or via irc-client/proxy
09:45 +zmx: So, I can have one irssi (proxy) running in a screen for home usage. And one irssi client (in another screen for avoir the use of znc) for my smartphone :D

14:28 +moobar: Hello all. Could someone please tell me the right how to get a user's away message in a script? I see that Nick->{} has a boolean to determine if the user is away or not, but doesn't provide the actual away message...?
14:28 +zmx: What is the away message ?
14:30 +moobar: The "/away I'm currently pooping" message
14:30 +moobar: (or status)
14:30 +Evil_: That was lol worthy.
14:31 * Evil_ goes back to the shadows.
14:34 +moobar: Hmmmmm
14:34 +vague`: moobar, you'd have to /whois them
14:34 +moobar: vague`: I was thinking that might be the only way
14:35 +moobar: Dang
14:42 --- evilRado is now known as Rado
14:44 +moobar: Given I'm pretty new at irssi scripting and still trying to figure out the event system and what-not, I don't suppose anyone can give me a hint on how I'd redirect a whois query to a variable? i.e. $server->command("WHOIS $foo");

14:54 +moobar: Or is there a better way to issue a /whois ?
14:56 +Bazerka_: if you want it to be hidden and capture its output, server redirection is how you do it
14:56 +vague`: You have several scripts on scripts.irssi.org that redirect whois output, look at those. don't ask me for names because I don't remember. Should be easy enough to find though.
14:57 +moobar: I've been digging through those scripts, but will have a closer look
14:57 +moobar: Thanks Bazerka_, I'll try figure that out
14:57 +Bazerka_: joininfo.pl is a good example, if somewhat complex

15:53 +bremner: am I right in thinking that openurl.pl assumes irssi is running inside screen?
15:53 +vague`: Why do you think that?
15:56 +bremner: well, it runs "screen $cmd" for each url handling command. So I guess what you are telling me is that it just depends on screen to save and restore the terminal state
15:56 +bremner: well, not to put words in your mouth, sorry
15:57 +bremner: Let me ask a question then. What does openurl.pl need screen for?
15:58 +vague`: Where does it run screen $cmd? Are we looking at the same script?
15:59 +bremner: on line 251

16:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tg]
16:29 +jayne: Is there any way for irssi to close a channel window without sending a PART?
16:29 +ds187: how about /window close
16:29 +ds187: hmm, or does it send a PART too?
16:29 +lestat: or /wc for the intimates
16:30 +jayne: window close sends a part
16:30 +zmx: if you don't send part, you will continue tu receive msg
16:32 +jayne: zmx: that's fine
16:33 +jayne: the reason I'm asking is because the part causes the bnc to leave the channel. I want the bnc to remain, but for irssi to "leave"
16:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Remco]
16:34 +jayne: the more I think about it, the more I think the BNC has to implement this, not irssi
16:37 * stoned uses znc without a hitch
16:37 +lestat: what's the purpose of a bnc over ssh+screen+irssi ?
16:38 +spb: jayne: iirc, znc calls that "detached channels"
16:38 +bremner: lestat: well, it allows to connect non-irssi clients as well, for example
16:39 +lestat: lol
16:39 +lestat: ok
16:39 +lestat: so it's useless to me ^^
16:39 +lestat: bremner: mmm but then what's the difference between a bnc and irssi-proxy ?
16:39 +zmx: irssi is not ported on iphone :$
16:39 +lestat: zmx: no but you have a ssh client :P
16:39 +zmx: true ...
16:40 +zmx: irssi-proxy doesn't have backlog ? :D
16:40 +bremner: yeah, ssh on iphone = much fun
16:40 +lestat: ^^
16:40 +Zed`: get an android - connectbot (ssh app) is pretty good
16:40 +zmx: (and irssi-proxy can't detach channels ?"
16:41 +Zed`: I use PaderSyncSSH on my berrry
16:41 +lestat: zmx: right, thanks for your answers :)
16:41 +bremner: znc has all kinds of features; whether you need them or not is up to you

21:23 +jayne: deathnote[]: you mean like user mode +g?
21:24 +deathnote[]: no
21:25 +jayne: how is what you want different, then?
21:28 +deathnote[]: I'm not sure what mode +g does but what I would like is when some priv msg me, I want my client to respond that I'm not acceptiong priv msg at this time
21:28 +jayne: that is exactly what +g does
21:28 +jayne: well, except the server responds instead of your client
21:29 +jayne: there's more info about it at http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml if you want to know more.
21:30 +deathnote[]: jayne: If the server does it and I don't get the notice, how would I know if the person Priv msg, plus, I want to set my own message to as why i'm not accepting priv msg
21:31 +jayne: the server provides a heavily ratelimited notice. It does not allow you to customize the message.
21:31 +deathnote[]: Yeah, i want to customize the message
21:32 +jayne: you could use something like trigger.pl to send a notice to the user when you receive a notice from the server saying someone tried to /msg you
21:35 +deathnote[]: jayne: Will mode +g on any network
21:36 +jayne: it works here. It will work on anything running Charybdis, and perhaps others. It won't work on all networks.
21:36 +deathnote[]: I'm fsck with securemsg and see if that accomplish what I need
21:41 +vague`: deathnote[], if you have a problem with securemsg, jsut ask, I wrote it, should be able to answer any questions you have. :)
21:42 +deathnote[]: vague`: Can you priv message and tell me if it's working
