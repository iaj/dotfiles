03:53 +r4_: yitz_: i wish it were that simple
03:53 +znx: or stuff like netsplit.de / gogloom
03:53 +yitz_: That's the one that does an external nicklist via a FIFO?
03:53 +r4_: yitz_: yes
03:53 +ezzieyguywuf: znx: saw that. I was on a non-freenode server though
03:54 +yitz_: Didn't I modify that for someone to only show bitlbee nicks and ignore other channels?
03:54 +r4_: yitz_: i want to be able to run the alias from any window and have it always show the names in &bitlbee and &bitlbee only
03:54 +r4_: let me be even mroe specific...
03:55 +r4_: this alias would always show the names of &bitlbee in the &bitlbee window regardless of the window the alias was executed in

15:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shamrock]
15:51 +grawity: AFAIK, split() only accepts patterns (regexps - /,/) and not strings...

15:53 +jan0s1k: oh ok
15:54 +znx: and he is right .. it only accepts regex
15:55 +jan0s1k: damn I saw in other script something like I paste with string so I thought that I can do this like this
15:56 +znx: jan0s1k: possibly '/,/'  needless quotes?

22:11 +FunkySayu: Hi
22:12 +FunkySayu: what's the original color code of IRSSI ?
22:13 +ahf: pink
22:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]
22:13 +FunkySayu: ?
22:13 +mauke: ?
22:13 +tomaw: ask a silly question... get a silly answer! :P
22:14 +FunkySayu: :'(
22:14 +tomaw: what do you mean by original colour?
22:14 +ahf: nah, let's be serious. irssi's origin colour code is blue, but during full moon it changes to cyan.
22:15 +FunkySayu: I find it
22:15 +FunkySayu: 15
22:15 +mauke: what
22:15 +ahf: http://www.facebook.com/irssi <- almost 4000 people!
22:15 +ahf: go go go go
22:15 +FunkySayu: <C-c>15
22:16 +ahf: c15goatse
22:16 +ahf: it doesn't work!111
22:16 +vague`: I plan to be -that- guy, the guy who never joined the irssi facebook group.
22:16 +ahf: hater.
22:17 +tomaw: you haven't spammed ircnet with that recently
22:17 +ahf: the finns are not on facecock
22:17 +MinceR: i'm not on DumbFuckBook, and not about to join :>
22:17 +ahf: plus, Tero is close to killing me i think
22:17 +tomaw: you are a bit mean
22:17 +ahf: i don't understand why people are so hateful towards facebook.
22:17 +tomaw: maybe just wallop the url and have them finish you off
22:17 +ahf: it's not exactly an open service, but it's nice
22:17 +ahf: tomaw: do what must be done!
22:17 +der-onkel: )1
22:18 +ahf: feel free to write that ahf has his pants down waiting for it to reach 4k
22:18 +tomaw: I think the reaction to you walloping ircnet would be more comical
22:18 +ahf: i should just start killing people with my eroyf client
22:19 +ahf: all the other opers would be like "who the hell is that?"
22:20 +tomaw: on kill path in the snotes?
22:20 +ahf: snotes? now i must laugh
22:20 +ahf: :P
22:21 +tomaw: I havne't looked at that ircd for some time
22:21 +ahf: nah, it has them, but they go to these magical channels.
22:21 +tomaw: it probably deserves to retire, die and be forgotten
22:21 +ahf: &KILLS and such
22:21 +tomaw: handy
22:22 +ahf: yeah, it's nice! it's basically what you do with scripting with the new and fancy ircd's!
22:22 +tomaw: and the earth said to ahf:
22:22 +tomaw: the new and fancy ircd's what?
22:22 +tomaw: I do lots of reformatting of channel output too
22:22 +ahf: you have to use ho_reformat and crap with the new ones to split snotes into categories that are shown in their own windows.
22:22 +ahf: yes, filthy animal ;(
22:23 +tomaw: colour++
22:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v earth]
22:23 +ahf: i have colours in my magical channels too!
22:23 +ahf: the same colours as everywhere else
22:24 +tomaw: I might take a look at them if I get bored enough
22:24 +ahf: ;D
22:24 +tomaw: I'm quite happy with ho_reformat.pl and my privmsg abomination
22:25 +tomaw: it means I can mess with the levels too
22:25 +ahf: i don't use ho_reformat, but i have written multiple formating files for people
22:25 +ahf: i used it when i opered on rizon
22:25 +tomaw: I stole jilles and added freenode/oftc stuff
22:25 +ahf: stealing things from jilles is usually not a bad move :P
22:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dispo]
22:26 +ahf: although his irssi session is nowhere near as pimped as it should be
22:26 +tomaw: and his formats are all wrong in that they output server name first meaning alignment depends on the server name length
22:26 +ahf: ah
22:26 +ahf: :D
22:26 +ahf: just add some padding char's!
22:26 +ahf: like X
22:26 +tomaw: hah
22:26 +tomaw: I just moved them all the end :P
22:27 +ahf: lame :P
22:27 +dispo: http://bugs.irssi.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=768&project=5 anyone have any info on this bug report? I'm getting the same behavior in cygwin.
22:27 +tomaw: fo freenode and oftc it doesn't matter which server did it most of the time
22:28 +ahf: dispo: never seen that before.
22:28 +tomaw: dispo: looks like it works here on os x
22:28 +ahf: yeah, same here
22:28 +ahf: mine's intel though :P
22:30 +dispo: guess i'll stick with ctrl+z for now
22:30 +shabble: it's failing for me on 10.5.8 whatever/intel
22:30 +shabble: well, sporadically working
22:30 +ahf: i have... whatever snow leopard is with newest updates
22:31 +shabble: dispo: does it work reliably/more often if you're not in the status window when you call /exec?
22:31 +dispo: no idea
22:31 +ahf: try!
22:31 +dispo: i don't have a status window
22:32 +dispo: gimme a sec
22:32 +shabble: oh, ok.  I'll count that as a 'no' then :p
22:32 +shabble: it appeared to be that way for me, but further testing looks like it's just coincidence
22:33 +dispo: so i'll take that as a "don't bother making a status window"

23:39 +saba: does anyone know a plugin that scans everything written in all windows, matching regex patterns or simple word list - and each time something matches it is highlighted in that window or the status window?
23:39 +vipwoody: ant1leb: everyhing is good bro, good to see you back on IRC :D
