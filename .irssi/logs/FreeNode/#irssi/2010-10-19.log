00:00 +bremner: is there a better way to change the colours nickcolor.pl uses other than editing the source?
00:01 +bremner: black on blue just isn't working for me :)
00:01 +Dirm: I just edit the source
00:08 +bremner: ok, easy enough.

00:21 +yitz_: How do I delay the autosendcmd a second?
00:24 +tsp: yitz_: something like /wait 1000;command?
00:24 +yitz_: Yeah. I need to IDENTIFY then WAIT
00:26 +tsp: if you're on freenode, don't do that
00:26 +tsp: otherwise, something like /msg nickserv identify blah;/wait 4000 should do it
00:30 +yitz_: I had some other ... issues. Cleared up, I think
00:30 +yitz_: Is there a way to reconnect on a /kill ?

00:37 +meonkeys: every time I start irssi, I have to do "/autoaway X" to tell autoaway.pl to start its timer again. Anyone know why? I'm using autoaway.pl 0.2 from http://www.flamingpackets.net/~vizzie/irssi/ . Hmm, I don't suppose vizzie is in here?
00:42 +yitz_: How about changing the tag of an existing server without disconnecting? Can that be done?
00:42 +meonkeys: aha, looks like the script only does anything with Irssi::servers()[0]

02:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v emma]
02:26 +emma: how do i set my server password. it seems that by using nickserv for the password irssi is not handling it right lately. And many channels won't let me join because i haven't authenticated yet.
02:26 +emma: or else perhaps i should add more time to the wait?

02:57 +emma: but how do i add in a password if it's not already in the server config
02:57 +emma: or do i remove it and type it all in again with a password?
02:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tolecnal]
02:57 +tsp: just remove it and type it
02:57 +bburhans: emma: just re-add the server, changing what you want to.
02:57 +bburhans: tsp: not necessary
02:57 +tsp: remember if it has spaces to quote it, that screwd me up a bit

06:58 +spike_: how can i reduce the space between the timestapm and the nick?
06:58 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tris]
07:01 +tmr: spike_, edit same formats you changed to get that indenting or disable/edit script doing that.
07:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Guest4598]
07:01 +tmr: Those also could originate from .theme.
07:02 +spike_: tmr: they came with a theme, and i'm searching in the theme to find the indenting but i can't see it
07:02 +spike_: the theme is fear2
07:03 +tmr: /\[-[0-9]
07:04 +spike_: tmr: huh? is that the tink i'm looking for?
07:05 +tmr: It might if your editor supports right search syntax.
07:06 +spike_: i'm using nano
07:07 +tmr: Probably not.
07:07 +tmr: Damn irssi theme page is annoying..
07:08 +spike_: i think i've found it, it's the same stuff as this, tmr
07:08 +tmr: spike_, could you provide direct link to that theme.

07:13 +tmr: I don't see any format changes in that theme, if you have them you've saved them yourself.
07:14 +spike_: yeah
07:14 +spike_: i _think_ i've got it
07:14 +spike_: just need someone with a long nick to test it :p
07:15 +tmr: Are you running scRipts that change nick colors or something like that?

19:03 +yitz_: It operates on the current window
19:03 +Zed`: ah I see
19:04 +tmr: yitz_, I guess you should thank Coekaerts.
19:04 +Zed`: it breaks bad if the window does not have a channel
19:05 +Zed`: [13:04] -!- Irssi: Error in script ack:
19:05 +Zed`: [13:04] Can't call method "window" on an undefined value at /home/zed/.irssi/scripts/ack.pl line 108.
19:05 +yitz_: Hrm...
19:05 +Zed`: I did it in my twitter window
19:05 +Zed`: it unloads
19:05 +yitz_: o.O
19:05 +yitz_: Nasty
19:05 +yitz_: It does witem->window()->{refnum}

19:22 +bremner: Zed`: ah, well, it might be the fact the the proxy is spewing backlog in the channels that makes chanact slow; only 50 lines x 25 channels, so not that epic, but who knows.

19:24 +bremner: Zed`: well, it just makes my machine unusable for 30 seconds, that is pretty severe.
19:25 +Zed`: ah
19:25 +Zed`: well I honestly don't think it could be chanact but idunno

20:02 +karsten-nr: Is there a way to have irssi give audio prompts if my name is mentioned?
20:02 +Zed`: beep
20:02 +Dirm: /set beep_msg_level hilight
20:02 +Dirm: though I prefer /set beep_msg_level hilight msgs, so it also beeps for queries
20:02 +Dirm: and test /beep to see if it works for you
20:03 +karsten-nr: Awesome.
20:03 +karsten-nr: That saves me from XChat.
20:03 +Dirm: and you might want to set up a hilight for your nick
20:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axius]
20:03 +Dirm: the default of /set hilight_nick_matches hilights lines that start with your nick, but not lines in which your nick appears elsewhere
20:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
20:03 +karsten-nr: Any way to make that a custom sound other than just "beep"?
20:04 +Dirm: there's a script on irssi.org
20:04 +Dirm: beepcmd.pl or so
20:04 +karsten-nr: Cool.
20:04 +bburhans: I think beep_beep does that
20:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tg]
20:04 +Zed`: isn't  that a funtion of your terminal?
20:04 +Dirm: I think there are multiple scripts on irssi.org :)
20:04 +bburhans: Zed`: it can be
20:04 +Dirm: yes you can also generally configure it in your terminal
20:04 +Dirm: which I guess is the better way if you're sshing :P
20:05 +karsten-nr: Dirm: Nope, xterm from host, though ssh is another approach (persistant connections).
20:05 +karsten-nr: Thanks guys.
20:05 +arachnist: karsten-nr: if you're over ssh configuring your terminal to actually beep is the right thing to do
20:07 +karsten-nr: arachnist: Got it.

20:21 +yitz_: Can I change the TAG of a connected network without disconnecting?
20:24 +Dirm: I don't think so

20:33 +Kottizen: I'd like to log everything, in the channel(s).
20:33 +tmr: Kottizen, http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c8

20:50 +Kottizen: tmr: I set ~/log/$tag/chn-$0/%Y/%m-%d.txt as path, but it only works for PMs.
20:50 +Kottizen: tmr: Could it be because the channel is containing a #?
20:52 +tmr: No.
20:53 +tmr: /set autolog_level
20:53 +tmr: (if you used autolog)
20:53 +Kottizen: It's on default
20:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v thoas]
20:55 +tmr: Does '/log' show open files for channels?
20:55 +Kottizen: ah nvm
20:55 +Kottizen: Found it
20:55 +Kottizen: It was my file manager
20:55 +Kottizen: It didn't show files beginning with a #-sign.
20:55 +Kottizen: Oh btw, is it possible to remove that sign and also not to log any PMs?
20:55 +tmr: Uh, sounds broken..
20:55 +Koffa: wtf
20:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v shad0wge1]
20:56 +Koffa: Kottizen: you'd have to configure the log-names manually
20:56 +Koffa: with /log
20:56 +tmr: You can add -MSGS to default autolog_level to get rid of pm.
20:57 +Koffa: or get logrotate.pl (or similar) and modify it to rename
20:57 +Koffa: or just fix the braindead filedamager (and beat the crap out of whoever made it)
20:58 +Kottizen: konqeueror <3
20:58 +Kottizen: tmr: ok, thank you.
20:59 +Koffa: config?
20:59 +Koffa: maybe it thinks those are backup-files
20:59 +Koffa: emacs makes those?
20:59 +Koffa: or is it .#* ?
