11:55 +Iceman_B: whats the syntax for the  autolog_ignore_targets setting ?
11:55 +Iceman_B: <nick1> <nick2> <nick3>  etc?
11:55 +Iceman_B: or comma seperated?
11:55 +Iceman_B: or is it a regex?
11:55 +Iceman_B: there is no /help for it ._.
11:56 +tmr: Spce seprted list most likely.
11:56 +tmr: Space separated even.

12:33 +stephan48: k i just moved the irssi to a new server... still alt+1 is not working
12:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v oliphant]
12:42 +Ticho: you can move irssi anywhere you want, it's your terminal's fault for not interpreting Alt key as "meta"
12:43 --- Weust` is now known as Weust`afk
12:43 +stephan48: Ticho: it works... i have alt+2 and so on
12:43 +stephan48: just alt 0 not
12:43 +stephan48: alt 1*
12:44 +trifler: use esc if you can't conf your wm.
12:44 --- Weust`afk is now known as Weust`
12:45 +Ticho: maybe you deleted the particular binding in irssi?
12:45 +stephan48: neither esc+1 work nor alt+1 but esc+2 and alt+2 and so on work
12:46 +stephan48: trifler: and i dont use a vm i use a terminal on a debian sid pc and a putty...
12:47 +Ticho: either you do not have window with number 1, or you deleted/changed the meta-1 binding in irssi
12:47 +stephan48: meta-1               change_window 1
12:47 +stephan48: win number 1 is my status window
12:47 +stephan48: and with /win 1
12:47 +stephan48: i can jump to it :)
12:47 +stephan48: so it exists
12:47 --- Weust` is now known as Weust`afk
12:48 +trifler: 12:48 meta-1               change_window 1
12:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
12:48 +stephan48: "^[                   key meta" the definition of my meta bind
12:49 +stephan48: ^[1 is alt+1 in my shell
12:49 +jink: alt = meta, and so is Escape.
12:49 +stephan48: ye
12:50 +stephan48: so the bind is correct?
12:51 +jink: ^[  key meta  sounds sane.
12:51 +jink: meta-1 sounds sane, too.
12:51 +Ticho: what if you move status window to 2, and create window 1 as a blank, levelless, targetless window_
12:51 +Ticho: ?
12:52 +stephan48: as fix? ;)
12:52 +Ticho: no, as debugging
12:52 +desikitteh{G}{H}: hey Ticho.
12:52 +stephan48: Ticho: would it work to move a existent window to 1 too?
12:53 +Ticho: sure
12:53 +stephan48: good
12:53 +stephan48: now i can access atleast the status window(2) but my test window(for hilights) with now number 1 not
12:53 +Ticho: point of the excercise is to figure out if it's the status window that is preventing the window change, or the alt+1 key combo itself
12:53 +stephan48: the key combo i think
12:54 +Ticho: ok
12:54 +Ticho: a script may be intercepting the keypress
12:54 +Ticho: other than that, i'm out of ideas :>
12:54 +Ticho: hey desikitteh{G}{H}
12:57 +stephan48: k
12:57 +stephan48: with all scripts unloaded i still get no working alt+1
13:00 +jink: Different terminal?
13:00 +jink: Perhaps your lovely terminal has alt-1 as switch to tab1 ?
13:01 +jink: esc-1 should work in that case, though.
13:01 +Ticho: hm, that's a good idea :>
13:01 +stephan48: jap
13:01 +stephan48: but esc-1 doesnt work also :)
13:01 +stephan48: so mh ;)
13:01 +jink: Ah. :P
13:01 +Ticho: also, putty doesn't work for him, i think
13:01 +jink: And esc-2, esc-3 etc, work?
13:02 +Ticho: still, plain xterm would probably be worth a try
13:02 +jink: Always. :D
13:03 +stephan48: yes
13:04 +stephan48: nope
13:04 +stephan48: not success
13:04 +stephan48: -t
13:04 +jink: :(
13:13 +stephan48: so you are clueless?
13:18 +jink: Pretty much. :)
13:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
13:18 +Ticho: does it work with default irssi config?
13:18 +Ticho: i.e. when you run irssi with --home=~/.fakeirssi
13:22 +stephan48: yeaaaa
13:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
13:22 +stephan48: k sounds like my config is fucked
13:23 +Ticho: try starting irssi without loading any scripts - chances are some of them broke the binding and unloading it did not correct it
13:24 +Ticho: that is, if you only tried unloading them from running irssi before
13:24 +stephan48: yea
13:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sas711]
13:25 +stephan48: nope
13:25 +stephan48: still broken
13:26 * jink breaks stephan48 a bit.
13:26 +Ticho: check the config file carefully, maybe the meta-1 binding has some unprintable character in it
13:26 +Ticho: but i'm grasping at straws here already :>
