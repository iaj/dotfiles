02:16 +mar77i: hello. I'm just curious, because I still find this pretty annoying about irssi: http://archives.seul.org/libevent/users/Aug-2010/msg00047.html
02:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Nei]
02:20 +mar77i: umm, did I ask here before? if it's a tmux problem, it's somewhere in tmux' libevent gores, where I had no luck yet... :(
02:24 +shabble: use screen? :)
02:27 +mar77i: yes, I thought of that. I would use screen on top of tmux to make things look good, which might even work. irssi is the only tool that fails with tmux, fullscreen updates just get truncated after ~7kb...
02:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v niko]
02:30 +shabble: I was more thinking of screen without tmux, since it probably has most of the needed features
02:30 +shabble: unless there's something specific in tmux you need?
02:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v JoeMaverickSett]
02:32 +mar77i: I like tmux for other features. it's scriptable, so I switched from screen to tmux about a year ago
02:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vincent_wang]
02:34 +Bazerka: am I missing something here
02:36 +Bazerka: $ strings `which tmux` | grep 'tmux 1'
02:36 +Bazerka: tmux 1.3, pid %ld, started %s
02:36 +Bazerka: and Ctrl-L redraws cause absolutely no display artifacts for me at all
02:37 +Bazerka: all statusbars are re-rendered correctly
02:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jaminja]
02:38 +Bazerka: $ pkg_info | grep -E '(tmux|libevent)'
02:38 +Bazerka: libevent-1.4.14b_1  Provides an API to execute callback functions on certain ev
02:38 +Bazerka: tmux-1.3            A Terminal Multiplexer
02:39 +mar77i: Bazerka: well, on an utf8 term? try vertical split and a terminal size of about 100*50 or so...
02:40 +mar77i: if one does fail, tell me :)
02:40 +Bazerka: full utf-8 stack, yes
02:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v niko]
02:41 +Bazerka: the only thing I'm not using is a vert split
02:41 +Bazerka: is that a pre-requisite for the bug?
02:41 +mar77i: maybe. how large is the term?
02:42 +Bazerka: > 100*50
02:43 +Bazerka: maximised putty @ 1680x1050 with a point 10 font
02:45 +mar77i: and with vsplit?
02:49 +Bazerka: as I said, I'm not using any vsplits
02:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v niko]
02:52 +mar77i: would you try running tmux selectw irssi \; split-window \; selectl main-vertical from a different terminal for test purposes?
02:54 +Bazerka: I've manually created a 50/50 vertical split in this window
02:54 +Bazerka: redrawing behaves correctly
02:55 +mar77i: then you're still missing something
02:55 +Bazerka: or it's just not reproducible here
02:55 +Bazerka: given that I'm not using linux
02:56 +desikitteh{G}{H}: what are you using?
02:56 +Bazerka: Irssi 0.8.15-svn (20101002) on FreeBSD 8.1-RELEASE (amd64) - http://irssi.org/
02:56 +desikitteh{G}{H}: nice. :o)
02:57 * desikitteh{G}{H} wants to have a prod at freebsd at some point.
02:57 +Bazerka: personally, I wouldn't use anything else :)
02:58 +desikitteh{G}{H}: i use slack for my little server box.
02:58 --- eightyei1ht is now known as eightyeight
02:59 +mar77i: my irssi 0.8.15 is on archlinux. thx anyway. maybe it's only when irssi is started in the split window... I saw that it's not failing the other way round when testing.
02:59 +Bazerka: I'll start a fresh irssi instance in the split
03:00 +desikitteh{G}{H}: that reminds me, i need to teach my bf how to use my irssi again.
03:00 +desikitteh{G}{H}: since i stared doing the multiple channels to a window thing, i haven't shown him.
03:01 +Bazerka: mar77i: both irssi instances are behaving correctly - with tmux's refresh-client and irssi's refresh_screen
03:01 +Bazerka: one irssi instance has splits, the other non-split
03:02 +Bazerka: even rotating them round the panes is re-rendering them quite happily
03:02 +Bazerka: zero artifacts at all
03:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
03:03 +mar77i: Bazerka: umm TERM?
03:04 +Bazerka: obviously screen inside of tmux
03:04 +mar77i: oh, would you try screen-256color, too?
03:04 +Bazerka: and xterm outside of tmux
03:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v niko]
03:05 +mar77i: within tmux, I mean.
03:05 +Bazerka: well yeah, as that wouldn't mean much outside of screen/tmux ;)
03:06 +Bazerka: x$ irssi
03:06 +Bazerka: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------xsetupterm() failed for TERM=screen-256color: -1
03:06 +mar77i: umm
03:08 +Bazerka: that's not surprising tho, as I have no screen-256color in my termcap
03:08 +mar77i: darn, okay, forgot about that
03:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Steve57]
03:10 +Bazerka: on a completely unrelated note
03:10 +Bazerka: hmmm, tmux's panes are per window
03:11 +Bazerka: and exactly how I wish splits were like in irssi
03:11 +tmr: Supporting both, per window and global splits, would be 100% win.
03:12 +Bazerka: per window splits would be heaven
03:12 +Bazerka: (aka pages I think coekie calls them on his split window page)
03:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
03:13 * Bazerka adds to his bluesky todo
03:13 +Bazerka: just to see what it would be like :)
03:13 +mar77i: gtg now. I'll be back. thx :)
03:13 +Bazerka: mar77i: np, sorry I couldn't replicate

07:05 +Armageddon: I'm talking about when pasting large amount of text
07:06 +Armageddon: it will buffer it bit by bit, I don't want that
07:07 +shabble: you can /set cmd_queue_speed, but if you make it too low, the server will boot you for flooding
07:07 +shabble: so it's a bit of a risky business
07:07 +Armageddon: shabble, let's say I know I will never get booted no matter how large the amount I send :d
07:07 +Armageddon: shabble, that's the lowest possible ?
07:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tyebud]
07:08 +shabble: well, it's currnetly 2.2 secs
07:08 +shabble: try 1000ms first?
07:08 +shabble: in theory, 10ms is the lowest irssi can do stuff
07:09 +shabble: but that will proably do Bad Things

07:11 +shabble: Armageddon: ok, well /set cmd_queue_speed to 20 or 50ms then
07:11 +Armageddon: I'll try it
07:11 +Armageddon: thank you very much, I tried it at 1 and it didn't work
07:11 +Armageddon: so I guess it was too low
07:11 +Armageddon: lol
07:12 +Armageddon: yitz_, ping yourself
07:12 +yitz_: Ooh. That smart!
07:12 +yitz_: 2.4 second round trip? Ugh
07:12 +Armageddon: lol
07:13 +Armageddon: yitz_, you already know that its the same way the lag system works right ?
07:13 +yitz_: I thought lag pinged the server, not yourself
07:13 +Armageddon: yitz_, I"m not sure you can ping the server with a succefull reply let me try it for you
07:14 +yitz_: The server pings me...
07:14 +Armageddon: actually you can ping the server
07:14 +Armageddon: with a successful pong reply
07:14 +Armageddon: that's it
07:14 +Armageddon: no time
07:15 +yitz_: You can ping or pong it? If you ping, you can time how long it takes for a pong
07:15 +Armageddon: yitz_, try it :)
07:16 +Armageddon: 08:14 -!- PONG received from EU.Beirut.Com: Armageddon
07:16 +Armageddon: oops

07:16 +Armageddon: it just pasted, is that okay ?
07:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v setheus]
07:17 +yitz_: Yeah. You ping the server and get a pong and time the trp
07:17 +yitz_: *trip
07:17 +Armageddon: yitz_, you can't time the trip
07:17 +Armageddon: try it
07:17 +yitz_: You use a stopwatch?
07:17 +Armageddon: you don't know when you sent the ping exactly
07:17 +Armageddon: good luck doing that each time
07:17 +Armageddon: pinging yourself is easier
07:18 +yitz_: If you script it, you can get some ... high res time
07:18 +yitz_: When you ping yourself, you open a new client-to-client connection for the answer
07:18 +Armageddon: divide it by two
07:18 +Armageddon: lol
07:19 +Armageddon: yitz_, you are choosing the hard way
07:19 +yitz_: :P
07:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v MinceR]

12:29 +SteelSide: Ticho, as in executing locale? or something else?
12:29 +Ticho: type locale in the shell where you normally run irssi
12:30 +SteelSide: yeah.. UTF-8 (en_GB.UTF-8 if you want the full one). Same as on my desktop
12:30 +cusco: utf8
12:32 +Ticho: UTF-8 works just as well
12:32 +Ticho: btw you shouldn't need any recode settings for typing in unicode
12:33 +SteelSide: hmm?
12:33 +SteelSide: so turn off recode_out?
12:33 +SteelSide: btw, if i change term charset to ISO-8859-1 in my terminal here locally, text inside the inputbox shows up OK, but actual chat window gets umlauts turned to unknown characters
12:34 +Ticho: that means you are typing in 885901
12:34 +Ticho: that means you are typing in 8859-1
12:34 +Ticho: maybe check those recode settings
12:34 +SteelSide: yeah I'm suspecting I have some part along my chain that is 8859-1, but I can't for the life of me figure out where..
12:34 +Ticho: can you type unicode chars in the shell correctly ?
12:35 +SteelSide: gnome terminal -> ssh -> screen -> irssi,
12:35 +SteelSide: uhm
12:35 +SteelSide: you mean one that isn't in iso-88591?
12:35 +Ticho: yes
12:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kkady32]
12:36 +SteelSide: let me find a chracter to copypaste..
12:37 +SteelSide: ê»
12:37 +SteelSide: ^ I hope that reverse F is not part of 8859-1, however it worked in both local and remote shell, but not in irssi. Can't see it in inputbox nor in chat
12:38 +Ticho: nope, it didn't display correctly
12:38 +SteelSide: gah
12:39 +SteelSide: what more can I test? all places I know about are set to UTF-8
12:40 +ds187: SteelSide: i have exactly the same problem here with putty -> ssh -> screen -> irssi........at home with gnome-terminal instead of putty everything works fine
12:40 +ds187: as a solution i thought about quitting my job, so that i don't have to use putty anymore ;-)
12:40 +Ticho: or works over here with putty on windows, and in urxvt on linux - same screen, same irssi
12:40 +SteelSide: >:( wish I had your issue, since I rarely use putty :p
12:41 +Ticho: s/or/it/
12:41 +SteelSide: perhaps I should try another shell and hope it's gnome-terminal
12:41 +ds187: i have same irssi and screen config on another server, and there everything works fine
12:42 +ds187: what distribution are you using on your server?
12:43 +SteelSide: ubuntu :|
12:43 +ds187: the server where it works is an ubuntu 8.04.....the server where it isn't working is a 10.04
12:44 +SteelSide: 9.04 here
12:44 --- uLinux_ is now known as pt
12:44 --- pt is now known as uLinux
12:45 +SteelSide: same issue with konsole
12:45 +ds187: but as a temporaryly worklaround i set up an ubuntu10.10 in virtualbox and using irssi from there :-)
12:45 +SteelSide: ere
12:46 +SteelSide: ds187, wait you put irssi inside the 10.10 or is that where you are ssh'ing from?
12:47 +ds187: ssh'ing
12:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Goe]

12:50 +neo10101: can any one tell me the best tool for foreign host monitore, line netstat -a
12:50 +neo10101: like netstat -a
12:52 +Goe: lsof
12:53 +ds187: SteelSide: but this phaenomenon is strange
12:54 +Ticho: neo10101: ssh remotehost "netstat -a"
12:54 +ds187: SteelSide: if you open a new window in your screensession, and there type some umlauts, do you see them?
12:54 +ds187: here it is so, that i can see my own umlauts in another screen window, but not in irssi-screen-window
12:56 +SteelSide: ds187, in the session? how do I do that?
12:56 * SteelSide just uses 1 window/session
12:56 +ds187: ctrl-a c
12:56 +SteelSide: and how do I get back after that?
12:56 +ds187: that should create another tab
12:57 +ds187: with F6 and F7
12:57 +ds187: or, if that downs't work: ctr-a n

12:57 +SteelSide: f buttons didn't work
12:58 +SteelSide: but yes, in the other window I could write umlauts correctly
12:58 +ds187: so exactly same phaenomenon as here
12:58 +ds187: strange
12:58 +SteelSide: should we gang up and file this as a bug somewhere (and hope to get bashed on the head with a simple solution?) ._.
12:59 +ds187: hehe
12:59 +ds187: but where to file a bug.....which of those programms causes this?
13:00 +SteelSide: yes that's the question ;p

13:03 +Death4Li1e: it is here
13:03 +SteelSide: hmm
13:03 +Death4Li1e: oau with two dots on each letter
13:04 +Death4Li1e: öäü < this :P
13:04 +Death4Li1e: using putty + ssh + screen + irssi... :)
13:05 +SwedeMike: ds187: I saw the umlauts correctly, but I correct both utf8 and 8859-1 to what I need.
13:05 +ds187: Death4Li1e: yes, that are german umlauts....thx
13:05 +ds187: so it must be a screen problem
13:06 +cusco: im using gnome-terminal + ssh + screen + irssi
13:06 +cusco: lol
13:06 +Death4Li1e: putty, screen and irssi are all set to use utf8 here
13:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v supercosmonaut]
13:06 +ds187: without screen it works
13:06 +cusco: hmm host running irssi is set with iso-8859
13:06 +ds187: what versions do you have?
13:06 +cusco: my gnome-terminal is set with utf
13:07 +SteelSide: ds187, works now.. I think I had some PEBKAC
13:07 +Death4Li1e: putty 0.60r3 + tray patch, irssi 0.8.15 and screen 4.0.3-14
13:07 +SteelSide: or rather, i started irssi outside of screen and then saw an error message about my locales
13:08 +SteelSide: apparantly this machine does not like en_GB.UTF-8, but en_GB.utf8
13:08 +ds187: screen 4.00.03jw4 (FAU) 2-May-06 here
13:08 +ds187: SteelSide: where did you see that error?
13:08 +Death4Li1e: that's the same thing screen -v shows me btw :P
13:10 +SteelSide: ds187, I just started irssi outside of screen, it plopped up for a second and then it went away as irssi started printing motds
13:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ds187_]
13:12 +SteelSide: ds187, think it was a perl error
13:12 +ds187: here i don't see any error
13:12 +SteelSide: might be cause my server is awfully slow :D
13:12 +SteelSide: anyhow, try setting LC_ALL to en_GB.utf8 just for a sec on your remote end
13:12 +SteelSide: didn't require a restart of irssi for me, it just started working
13:13 +SteelSide: (err or whatever other utf8 locale you find in locale -a)
13:14 +SteelSide: and ofcourse I then see some unknown character boxes in another chat.. at least I can see my own umlauts åäö :>
13:17 +ds187: still no umlauts here
13:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cli]
13:17 +Ticho: SteelSide: i can see your umlauts too :>
13:18 +ds187: is there a difference between LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 and LC_ALL="en_US.utf8"
13:18 +Ticho: no
13:18 --- cli is now known as Guest37399
13:23 +SteelSide: Ticho, but you could that before too right :)?

15:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dhruvasagar]
15:04 +Ticho: clrg: your terminal probably doesn't interptet alt key as "meta"

15:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Steve57]
15:08 +clrg: Ticho: I use xterm. When I press alt+4 for examle, this character appears: ´
15:08 +clrg: How do I set the left alt key to meta?
15:09 +catsup: xmodmap
15:09 +catsup: uh
15:10 +Ticho: disable deadkeys, or use english keyboard
15:10 +catsup: but make sure you disable meta-sends-escape in xterm
15:11 +catsup: or wait what
15:11 +catsup: for what you want, maybe just enable it
15:11 +clrg: Ticho: I use an American keyboard, but I need AltGr deadkeys for characters like äéöüßð
15:12 +catsup: hold ctrl + hold left click and choose meta sends escape, then what happens
15:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Jestre]
15:12 +catsup: neway, some combination of meta sends escape and xmodmap commands is what you want
15:13 +catsup: i don't have the first idea how to type äéöüßð tho
15:13 +clrg: catsup: Thank you, that fixed it :) You must think I'm a total idiot, I didn't even know about that menu ^^
15:13 +catsup: clrg: ok, now to make your change permanent
15:14 +catsup: add this line to $HOME/.Xresources -- xterm*metaSendsEscape: true
15:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v macmaN]
15:14 +clrg: catsup: I also speak French and German, so I sometimes use that. If you want to make an é for example, press AltGr + e. For ë, press AltGr+r
15:14 +catsup: and then type xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources (or restart X)
15:15 +catsup: xterm has more menus btw
15:15 +catsup: for the other mouse keys
15:15 +catsup: and also about a billin optoins to configure in .Xresources
15:15 +catsup: billion
15:16 +clrg: Very handy.

23:21 +dagni: hi
23:21 +dagni: how do i stop irssi from reconnecting to the server and joining channels after i get disconnected for some reason ?
23:22 +Dirm: probably not the greatest way, but you could set server_reconnect_time to a few years
23:25 +dagni: lol
23:25 +dagni: not a bad idea after all
23:25 +dagni: 23:25 server_reconnect_time = 999999999999
23:25 +dagni: that should be enough ;P
23:27 +Dirm: I don't think that will work
23:27 +Dirm: too large
23:28 +Dirm: it gets stored in an int as milliseconds
23:28 +dagni: shouldn't irssi tell me that it's too big ?
23:28 +Dirm: max length is like 24 days
23:28 +Dirm: yeah, that'd be nice, wouldn't it :P
23:28 +Dirm: hmm
23:28 +dagni: when i put random chars into that set
23:28 +dagni: i get
23:28 +dagni: 23:27 -!- Irssi: Invalid timestamp
23:28 +dagni: so i think the 999999999999 is valid..
23:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sud0]
23:28 +dagni: but i did this: 23:27 server_reconnect_time = 999999999999min
23:28 +dagni: now it's in minutes
23:28 +dagni: :D
23:29 +dagni: if i calculate good, it's 1902587 years
23:30 +webvictim: maybe it'll crash when you next disconnect
23:30 +Dirm: yeah that function sucks
23:30 +webvictim: which would have the same effect ;)
23:30 +Dirm: the comment says it only supports up to 24 days
23:30 +Dirm: but it only actually checks for overflow if you specify the units in days
23:30 +Dirm: otherwise it just overflows and wraps around
23:30 +dagni: ok i set 20 days then ;P
23:32 +dagni: also
23:32 +dagni: how do i tell irssi to do some action like '/msg' after connecting to a server but before joining a channels ?
