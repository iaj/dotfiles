01:36 +chahibi: hello
01:38 +chahibi: is there anyway in irssi to list the available (not away) users of a channel?
01:38 +chahibi: in x-chat, away users are grayed.
01:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v emma]
01:47 +yitz_: It should be easy enough to wrap the /names command to /whois everyone and  indicate away or not. You'd have to script it, though

02:25 +yitz_: Try asking a question
02:25 +Ram191: What the differen between .pvk and .cer file
02:26 +yitz_: I would guess one is a private key and the other is a certificate
02:27 +yitz_: A private key is used to encrypt/decrypt while a certificate proves someone is who they claim
02:27 +yitz_: Not that that has anything to do with irssi...

18:41 +SvenGuckes: ds187: type "CTRL-A i" for info
18:42 +billnye: ds187: if the encoding is wrong you usually get multiple characters, if the font is wrong you usually get one
18:42 +SvenGuckes: it should say something like "(10,27)/(102,29)+1000 +flow app UTF-8.."

20:34 +rga: Hello
20:35 +rga: I have an asus eee pc 1005HA, the only way to use scroll I think its esc +p or esc +n, nothing else? no up/down page works for me.
20:37 +tmr: No Alt?
20:37 +rga: uhmm, yes, it works too, thank you :)
20:38 +rga: but usn +p  or +n, no up/down
20:39 +tmr: esc, p and alt-p are equal if your terminal has been configured that way.
20:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v bradoaks]
20:40 +rga: well, not exactly, if I press alt + p it continues doing up, but if I use esc + p i need to repeat all time to scroll up.
20:41 +shabble: well, alt/meta usually works like "If I am pressed, when another key is pressed, send <esc><key>", and hten key-repeat means it keeps sending that sequence
20:41 +shabble: whereas with the escape key, you have to manually repeat the sequence
20:41 +tmr: If esc+p really works that is wierd.
20:42 +tmr: Hmm.. Or not, seems to work on xterm.
20:42 +rga: anyway, looks like alt+p works perfect and continues, thank :)
20:42 +rga: I use rxvt-unicode
20:46 +billnye: rga: you can probably configure your pgup/pgdn keys as well
20:47 +rga: how can configure that?
20:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v 52AACKI94]
20:47 +billnye: if you open a new terminal and do "cat", what do your pgup and pgdn keys echo?
20:48 +rga: ^[[A^[[B
20:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ingenious]
20:52 +billnye: rga: and your up and down arrow keys?
20:54 +rga: what you mean?
20:54 +rga: up = ^[[A
20:54 +billnye: "what do your up and down arrow keys echo, under the same circumstances?"
20:54 +rga: down = ^[[B
20:55 +billnye: rga: and they're different physical keys on the kb than the pgup/pgdn, right?
20:55 +rga: Repav, AvPag, I have spanish keyboard.
20:56 +billnye: that's irrelevant to my question, which remains
20:56 +rga: well, I think that I don't understand you cuestion because my english sucks ;/
20:57 +billnye: rga: not a problem, I'm re-wording
20:57 +billnye: you notice the first keycodes you pasted are identical to the second group you pasted... are they indeed coming from different keys on your keyboard?
20:57 +rga: no, are the same, I have only up/down buttons
20:58 +rga: in order to work using rxvt I do this.
20:58 +rga: xmodmap -e "keycode 111 = Up Page_Up"
20:58 +rga: xmodmap -e "keycode 116 = Down Page_Down"
20:58 +rga: to use scroll under rxvt
20:59 +rga: but for some reason, does not work vs irssi.
