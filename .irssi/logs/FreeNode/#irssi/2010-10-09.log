19:56 +zayr: How to set ipv6 host in irssi ?
19:56 +grawity: Local or remote host?
19:56 +zayr: local
19:56 +grawity: /set hostname
19:57 +grawity: Or per-network, /network add -host ..... freenode
19:57 +zayr: Thanks
19:57 +grawity: of course, you have to make sure you _connect_ over IPv6
19:57 +grawity: Global is /set resolve_prefer_ipv6 on
19:57 +grawity: Or per-server, /server add -6 .....
19:58 +zayr: and remote hos;t ::D
19:58 +grawity: zayr: It's always the same, for both v4 and v6.

23:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v TmBerg]
23:23 +DigitalKiwi: by fixing the error! ;p
23:24 +tommys: I cannot do that
23:24 +tommys: I mean, I don't know much about the script to debug it
23:25 +shabble: what script what error?
23:25 +tommys: gtrans
23:25 +tommys: and the error:

23:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
23:26 +shabble: hmm
23:26 +shabble: link to the script?
23:26 +tommys: and I suspect that it basically happens because I'm on a flaky wifi connection. I cannot do anything about it, so to get at it I think I should just have irssi restart it
23:27 +tommys: sure, just a sec

23:34 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 65 seconds
23:35 +jink: There are several plugins for WinAmp, for example, that allow you to get the information of the currently playing song through http, or a local file.
23:35 +jink: Figure it out. :)
23:35 +Dougdoug4: i can't
23:35 +tommys: shabble: so, would you agree that I should rather just try to have it restarted?
23:36 +vert2: Dougdoug4: look at the popular mIRC now playing scripts, see how they work, then write one for irssi in Perl
23:36 +tommys: and when it comes to that, can you suggest how I should do that?
23:36 +shabble: tommys: the best plan would be to find the function that is failing, and wrap it in an eval { } for error handling
23:37 +tommys: shabble: that is far outside my expertise of perl, so that's not quite an option. unless of course, you're willing to walk me through it
23:38 +DigitalKiwi: you aren't much of an expert in perl if you can't figure out eval ;p
23:38 +shabble: but, if you can't be bothered, something like '/script exec -permanent Irssi::signal_add 'script error', sub { my $scr = shift; print "$scr script died. Reloading"; Irssi::command('script load script_name.pl') if $scr eq '/path/to/script'; };' might work
23:38 +shabble: tommys: run that once to get the appropriate name to add into the eq ' ' bit
23:38 +tommys: eq?
23:39 +shabble: if $scr eq 'some string'
23:39 +shabble: I'm not entirely certain what that string will be - either a filename or path
23:40 +tommys: alright, I'll try that out. thanks
23:41 +shabble: tommys: 2 things: every time you run that command (or one like it), you're effectively starting a script called 'data<number>', make sure you unload hte old ones '/script unload data1', etc
23:41 +shabble: otherwise weird stuff could happen
23:41 +shabble: also, it won't be persistent across restarts of irssi, so add the working line to your ~/.irssi/startup file
23:41 +tommys: alright

23:46 +Dougdoug4: do it yourself
23:46 +Dougdoug4: next please.
23:47 +NiveusLuna: ...seriously. i've looked at the documentation available, and everything seems to be right, but it isn't working.
23:48 +Dougdoug4: that's too bad do it yourself
23:48 +Dougdoug4: next please.
23:49 +NiveusLuna: okay... may I ask why you refuse to help?
23:49 +DigitalKiwi: NiveusLuna: don't mind Dougdoug4
23:50 +DigitalKiwi: he's just butthurt cause he's on windows and can't find a now playing script
23:50 +jink: :>
23:51 +NiveusLuna: those are more annoying than anything, why would he want one?
23:51 +DigitalKiwi: i think it fits his character
23:51 +NiveusLuna: ah
23:52 +NiveusLuna: anybody else have ideas?
23:54 +shabble: NiveusLuna: what doesn't work about it?
23:55 +NiveusLuna: shabble: keep getting "connection refused" when i try to connect using andchat.
23:55 +shabble: correct ports at both ends? have you set a password?
23:55 +shabble: do you get a 'connection attempt from ...' in your irssi?
23:56 +NiveusLuna: yes, yes, no.
23:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jillsmitt]
23:57 +shabble: is the irssi host linux?
23:57 +NiveusLuna: yes, debian squeeze
23:57 +Dice-Man: irssi is cool on matrix colors
23:57 +shabble: try 'netstat -anl | grep LISTEN' on that machine
23:58 +shabble: and see if any of the ports match up with the port you set to listen
23:58 +NiveusLuna: ok
23:59 +NiveusLuna: ...if i'm reading this right... it's listening on ipv6. which i don't use.
23:59 +NiveusLuna: that explains it
23:59 +jink: ipv6 usually means it listens on both ipv4 and ipv6.
