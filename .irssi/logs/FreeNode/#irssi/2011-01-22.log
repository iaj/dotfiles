00:19 +anao: hi@all can anyone tell me why /msg nickserv identify passw does not show a echo
00:19 +billnye: anao: it probably is somewhere you're not looking for it
00:20 +iaj: p4aved: thanks!
00:20 +anao: hello how can i see if i am successful identified?
00:20 +quintopia: if nickserv replies and says you are
00:21 +quintopia: either on status window or in its own query window
00:21 +anao: i enter /msg NickServ identify passw and press enter
00:21 +anao: nothing no answere no echo, but on my older tool ircii and xchat it works
00:22 +anao: i was thinking that iam stupid..
00:22 +quintopia: try /q nickserv and have a chat with it
00:22 +anao: ok thanks
00:22 +anao: i relogin with irssi

00:24 +anao: thanks to all /q nickserv works..
00:26 +billnye: anao: that means the reply was probably either in a query you didn't know was there, or off in the status or another itemless window
00:26 +billnye: good to see you've got it licked :)
