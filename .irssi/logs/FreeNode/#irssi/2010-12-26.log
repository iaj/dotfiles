21:29 +albacker: hello, how do i join another server without disconecting to the one i am now?
21:29 +albacker: s/to/from/
21:30 +tmr: /help connect
21:30 +mauke: /connect
21:32 +albacker: tmr: mauke thanks.
21:32 +albacker: also, how do you go from one window to another in xterm?
21:33 +albacker: alt + num doesn't seem to work (what i used in gnometerminal)
21:34 +Ticho: try escape + num
21:34 +Ticho: obviously gnometerminal doesn't interpret your alt key as required "meta"
21:35 +albacker: Ticho: im using another wm now (fluxbox before and awesome wm now), maybe that changed alt from the required meta?
21:35 +albacker: and no space num doesn't work neither
21:35 +Ticho: escape, not space
21:35 +albacker: ah
21:35 +albacker: yes it works.
21:36 +Ticho: that's because it's another way of inputting meta :>
21:36 +albacker: hmm i see. thanks.

22:17 +vague`: albacker, you need to tell xterm that meta sends escape, you have a tip for that in tips&tricks or the faq on the irssi website.
22:20 +vague`: It was here: http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c2
22:20 +mansfeld: sorry if this question has been asked a hundred times before, but how can I delay autojoin until my clock has been applied?
22:20 +mansfeld: the 'delay 2000' in the examples I found doesn't seem to be sufficient

23:03 +dx: hey guys, is there any quick way to access windows after 19?
23:04 +xgenesis: have you ever tried to use alias to switch windows?
23:04 +xgenesis: ie: /1, /2, /3, etc
23:04 +rudi_s: dx: Not directly. You can map more keys, use scripts like window_switcher.pl or goto.pl
23:04 * dx checks those scripts
23:08 * Remco has 32 windows mapped to keys
23:09 +dx: Remco: holy crap. what keys did you use?
23:09 +Remco: 1-0, q-p, a-l, z-v
23:10 +Remco: Oh, not a.
23:10 +dx: but alt-p, alt-a, etc are already mapp-
23:10 +dx: ah
23:10 +dx: what about p?
23:10 +Remco: Remapped :)
23:10 * Deeps is using 1-0, q-p, a-l, z-m, Q-P, A-L-, Z-M
23:10 +Remco: Didn't need the old action
23:11 +Deeps: up to 62 windows directly accessible np
23:11 +dx: nice
23:11 +Remco: But the last ones need two modifier keys
23:11 +Deeps: yes
23:12 +Remco: It depends a lot on how you work with windows. If you have a lot of windows that appear/disappear then mapping them is not very useful
23:12 +Remco: Since you'll have to guess where they are
23:13 +dx: well, right now i have less than 20 windows, most of them stay in the same place and i end up associating numbers to channels in my mind
23:13 +Remco: I only change one or two channels a year, so for me it makes sense
23:14 +dx: i think adding another row of keybindings is exactly what i need now
23:14 +dx: so... huh... how do i do that?
23:15 +Remco: /help bind
23:16 +Deeps: from my irssi conf: http://pastebin.com/kS3rUJUv
23:16 +Deeps: may or may not be relevant to your interests
23:17 +dx: Deeps: thanks, i think i'll take up to meta-l for now
23:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v charitwo]
23:17 +Bazerka: xgenesis: using aliases for that is nasty - use the modified dispatch.pl instead
23:18 +charitwo: Why does irssi automatically insert this randomly into channels ready to be sent: 6c
23:18 +Bazerka: charitwo: never seen that behaviour
23:19 +charitwo: like if i type /win 12, this 6c will be automatically filled in
23:20 +xgenesis: eh
23:20 +xgenesis: i'm used to this
23:20 +xgenesis: proven itself well over the years
23:21 +dx: okay, i can now access up to window 29, thanks everyone :D
