10:36 +tvm: there is some kind of queue and after few lines, irssi will start to control the delay between outgoing messages
10:39 +tvm: the reason why i'm asking is because i use irssi also with bitlbee and we often paste long parts of code here at work and irssi seems to delay whole transaction

10:46 +shabble: oh, actually, it seesm you can pass it as -cmdspeed to /network
10:46 +tvm: hmm.
10:46 +tvm: i already lowered this value to 500

19:02 +shades: hey guys
19:02 +shades: my time is different than the system time.. what could be the issue?
19:02 +shades: searching for 'time' in the docs is a little too generic of a search term
19:03 +SwedeMike: how much different?
19:04 +shades: I think this server is either west coast or east coast and it's reporting 15:31:28
19:04 +shades: so it should be 10:04:00 or 13:04:00
19:06 +vague`: shades, /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'CET'; to set the timezone correctly.
19:07 +shades: CET is central?
19:07 +shades: PET or PST is what I want?
19:07 +vague`: CET is central european time
19:07 +FauxFaux: shades: Just try it?
19:07 +vague`: Find out which timezone the server is in/you are in and run that command.
19:08 +shades: the server might be in a different time zone than I am
19:08 +vague`: Well which timezone do you want to display the time for?
19:08 +shades: pacific
19:09 +vague`: So set it to pacific.
19:09 +shades: although I can never remember if it's PST during this time or year or if it's always PST
19:09 +shades: because they observe that light saving/wasting thing
19:09 +vague`: There are sites on the internet that can tell you.
19:09 +shades: yeah, I'm trying to look
19:09 +shades: but either dns is borked or the first couple of sites are down, still looking though
19:12 +shades: odd
19:12 +shades: vague`: now my timestamp reports 23:37:42
19:12 +shades: after doing PST instead of CET
19:12 +shades: that's totally incorrect too
19:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mirko]

19:18 +Nei: probably your system time is wrong then?
19:18 +Nei: as admin, use date mmddhhmm to correct it
19:18 +billnye: or better yet ntpdate
19:19 +shades: i don't have administrative privledges

19:23 +billnye: shades: do the date command from outside irssi
19:24 +shades: Tue Dec  7 15:47:30 PST 2010
19:24 +shades: and it's totally 10:24 right now
19:27 +billnye: shades: you could get close by applying one of the :30 timezone offsets
19:27 +billnye: try setting a GMT-X timezone that results in the "right" time instead of your actual, perhaps?
19:28 --- Weust` is now known as Weust`afk
19:28 +shades: billnye: what would that be? GMT-8?
19:28 +shades: GMT-8:30 ?
19:28 +Dirm: PST is already GMT-8
19:28 +Dirm: you need to subtract another 5.5 hours
19:28 +Dirm: so 13.5
19:29 +shades: /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'GMT-13.5'; ??
19:29 +billnye: point being, if the system clock is wrong, your timezone will need to be wrong too
19:29 +Dirm: wait how did you get 23:41 PST and then 15:47 PST 7 minutes later?
19:29 +znx: that doesnt work
19:30 +shades: Dirm: it was earlier, and then it got set to a later time when I ran that command
19:30 +shades: now it's 12:53 with gmt-13.5
19:31 +znx: GMT+ or - only has full hours but you could make hack your own zoneinfo .. i think that would need to be install by root though .. so no good
19:31 +shades: boooo
19:31 +znx: basically .. you need someone to fix your server date
19:31 +shades: /script exec $ENV{'TZ'} = 'GMT-11'; is the closest I can get
19:32 +znx: nothing else is worthwhile
19:32 +shades: at 10:54
19:32 +tmr: And install/configure ntpd..
19:32 +znx: tmr: or at least crontab a ntpdate  ;-)
19:32 +znx: later foods
19:33 +tmr: That clock skew seems way to bad to be fixed with crontabbed ntpdate.
19:34 +billnye: tmr: once per minute ;D
19:35 +billnye: shades: are you in the same timezone as the box admin?
19:35 +shades: well there /were/ two servers, one was pst and the other was est
19:35 +shades: but they merged into one box
19:35 +shades: and then I think this box was migrated to amazons cloud
19:36 +shades: so I have no fkin clue where it is now
19:36 +billnye: well the Right Way to do the clock on multi-user systems is hardware clock in GMT, and timezones via $TZ
19:36 +billnye: so I'd petition for that :)
19:37 +shades: yeah it might take a few days
19:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axius]
19:39 +billnye: so your three options are probably leave it way wrong so you don't get confused, pick the closest GMT-X, or figure out what that value is and hope there's a legitimate :30 timezone equivalent

20:02 +billnye: you'd be happy with "lol~eddie@ns213451.ovh.net" ?

20:02 +Dirm: (requires disconnect/connect to take effect)
20:02 +billnye: (rather than /reconnect)
20:02 +Dirm: for the other part, you need to look into freenode cloaks

20:09 +wwwdotcom: is there a script or something that can alert me when a certain word is displayed in a channel? like play a song or something?
20:09 +mauke: babilen: that sounds like a FAQ
20:09 +mauke: wwwdotcom: I bet trigger.pl could be made to do that
20:09 +wwwdotcom: mauke: thanks
20:09 +mauke: or even just /hilight
20:10 +babilen: mauke: It might be frequently asked, but it is not in FAQ (cf. http://irssi.org/documentation/faq) (or I am blind)

20:12 +wwwdotcom: mauke: how do i do it using hilight?
20:12 +babilen: mauke: Will that still ensure that all the messages are aligned (i.e. alignment of messages does not depend on nick length) ?
20:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v dngor]
20:13 +mauke: babilen: dunno
20:14 +mauke: wwwdotcom: you include HILIGHT in your beep_msg_level
20:14 +mauke: and then irssi will beep whenever a highlighted word is said
20:14 +mauke: some terminals let you customize the beep sound
20:15 +wwwdotcom: mauke: is that complicated to set up? i'm new to irssi and irc even. would the script be easier?
20:15 +cnl: Hello. /reload command partially breaks cyrillc strings. I use UTF8, irssi version 0.8.15.
20:16 +billnye: cnl: what does "partially breaks" mean?
20:16 +cnl: partially strings stands readable
20:17 +billnye: cnl: what strings where, when, and under what conditions?
20:17 +babilen: mauke: Unfortunately that did not remove the padding. The nicks are right aligned (like before) but still "<   babilen >" and not "<babilen>" -- Any ideas which documentation I could read?
20:17 +billnye: babilen: http://irssi.org/documentation/formats and those mentioned items in your theme
20:18 +cnl: everywhere in irssi window: in chat window, topic string, etc
20:18 +cnl: when I just start irssi all seems ok
20:18 +cnl: and when I enter /reload, some characters become trash
20:18 +cnl: sorry for my English
20:19 +babilen: billnye: thank you -- I'll try to figure it out.
20:19 +cnl: by trash I mean symbols like >O

21:58 +ahf: nah.
21:58 +ahf: i usually miss that message somehow.
21:59 +svip: In fact, if irssi developers ever threw a new years party, it should be called 'day changed to'.

22:05 +sjk: So now I have like, 15 channels
22:05 +ahf: sjk: i just use the hacked dispatch.pl
22:05 +ahf: which gives me /N
22:05 +ahf: worst thing is.. i run 3 clients ;(
22:06 +ahf: one for our work network, which i can only get on using our vpn, then this one which is freenode and some other random networks
22:06 +ahf: then i have one for ircnet/efnet
22:15 +Koffa: I don't see how anyone could go for less than 2... work and private ircing don't mix that well
22:15 +celthunder: Koffa, i use the same for work and private
22:15 +celthunder: what's wrong iwth it?
22:15 +Koffa: shiver
22:16 +Death4Life: companies use IRC at work? :o
22:16 +Koffa: it's mandatory
22:16 +Koffa: like e-mail, u know
22:16 +Death4Life: oh :p

22:24 +ahf: Koffa: i would, if i could, only use one client
22:24 +ahf: Death4Life: some does, yeah

22:30 +Einzig_: hello
22:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v wallander]
22:32 +Einzig_: Is there a command to filter out sentences on matching certain words?
22:33 +Einzig_: For instance if someone says "woot" the whole sentence gets filtered out?
22:33 +Death4Life: see /help ignore
22:35 +rudi_s: Einzig_: That won't filter sentences though, but lines.

22:49 +Einzig_:  /ignore -regexp -pattern "(troll|Troll)"  ALL
22:49 +Einzig_: is that supposed to be correct?
22:49 +Einzig_: It looks like an example
22:49 +Einzig_: But the lines with troll are still there
22:50 +mauke: /ignore isn't retroactive
22:50 +mauke: also, useless use of ( )
22:50 +Einzig_: tried [Tt]roll too
22:50 +Einzig_: What do you mean?
22:51 +Einzig_: It does not match any such occurance in a line?
22:51 +billnye: Einzig_: try just /ignore troll
22:51 +mauke: I mean the ( ) are useless and can be removed
22:51 +billnye: I'm pretty sure it's case-insensitive by default
22:51 +Einzig_: billnye: I want to ignore people talking to the troll too
22:51 +Einzig_: so match on Troll: and " hey troll blah"
22:52 +billnye: what your're doing is NOTHING like the example that's related to that
22:52 +billnye: see "ignore user and all replies"
22:52 +billnye: also perhaps helful is that a nickmask is nick!user@hostname
