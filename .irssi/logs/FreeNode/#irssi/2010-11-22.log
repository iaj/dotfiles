03:21 +Dougdoug4: i'm running irssi in cygterm
03:21 +Dougdoug4: how do i make the background an image
03:21 +K350: do u want a bg img for irssi?
03:22 +billnye: Dougdoug4: that's a cygterm question, and I'm not sure cygterm can
03:23 +Dougdoug4: yea, i want a background image
03:23 +Dougdoug4: haha
03:23 +Dougdoug4: know if it's possible K350?
03:24 +K350: Dougdoug4: No idea, as billnye said it's not really an irssi issue
03:24 +K350: Dougdoug4: however, have a look at irssi.org if it says anything about varius platforms etc....
03:25 +billnye: (I doubt it'd be mentioned there)
03:25 +billnye: google cygwin terminal background image?
03:26 +K350: hm, I doubht one can have a bg img in cygwin...
03:26 +K350: doubht
03:26 +K350: I can't spell

03:29 +Dougdoug4: i just got an epic idea
03:29 +Dougdoug4: would this work;
03:29 +Dougdoug4: start watching a movie on vlc
03:29 +Dougdoug4: set vlc to 'always on top'
03:29 +Dougdoug4: then make cygterm with irssi fullscreen
03:29 +Dougdoug4: would that WORK
03:30 +nightfrog: K350: The FAQ
03:30 +K350: Dougdoug4: you would have vlc on top
03:30 +Dougdoug4: yea
03:31 +K350: nightfrog: yeah, I've to check. I'm trying here first  - beign lazy :-)
03:31 +K350: Dougdoug4:Err, I don't see the point?

03:32 +K350: Dougdoug4: Oh, well...ok (?)
03:33 +K350: Dougdoug4: what abotu running Linux instead of cygwin?

03:35 +billnye: it does need 32 instead of 64 though

13:54 +grawity: Beefcakes: but for authentication, look for "server password" in /server [the format on Freenode is "username:password"; and just "password" elsewhere]

16:11 +h4x0r`: ctrl+b for bold
16:11 +h4x0r`: ctrl+u for underline
16:11 +h4x0r`: I cant seem to do italics in irssi tho
16:11 +catsup: uh
16:11 +catsup: isn't ctrl-i tab?
16:11 +grawity: 1) 17:03 (+grawity) irssi is a terminal program, and most terminals do not support italics
16:11 +h4x0r`: not in mirc
16:11 +catsup: lol
16:11 +catsup: i mean
16:11 +h4x0r`: okey doke
16:11 +grawity: 2) yes, ^I equals Tab in terminals
16:11 +catsup: you might *type* ctrl-i for italics
16:11 +MinceR: ctrl+i is the tab character
16:12 +h4x0r`: so is /this/ more of a user thing is it, and doesnt produce any formatting ?
16:12 +catsup: ^I is tab in ASCII
16:12 +Nei: ctrl+{i,b,u} are mirc key bindings
16:12 +catsup: and UTF8
16:12 +MinceR: so if it's interpreted specially then you will get strange results when somebody pastes text with tabs
16:12 +catsup: but i don't think that mirc is sending ^I to encode italics
16:13 +MinceR: then again, mirc sends ^C if you press ^K, iirc
16:13 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 138 seconds
16:13 +h4x0r`: don't know, its prolly just an interpretation hardcoded into mirc itself
16:13 +grawity: I'm guessing it uses something in the near range of existing bold/color codes
16:13 +h4x0r`: know what im sayin?
16:13 +h4x0r`: that maybe mirc just parses ctrl+i as italics for whoever's running the client
16:14 +catsup: i searched 'mirc italics' and found out that PIRCH uses ^R for italics, but mirc doesn't...
16:14 +h4x0r`: hm
16:14 +h4x0r`: ^Rtest
16:14 +grawity: Mmm, PIRCH
16:14 +catsup: no
16:14 +Nei: reverse
16:14 +grawity: h4x0r`: ^R meaning the ASCII code that equals Ctrl-R -- _not_ ^ plus R
16:14 +grawity: Nei: Negative.
16:14 +catsup: now that i look at the page, i see it's being retarded, confusing keybindings with encodings
16:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sud0]
16:15 +catsup: reverse
16:15 +catsup: nope :\
16:16 +h4x0r`: well it was kinda interesting any so thanks guys :p
16:16 +catsup: Italic or reversed
16:16 +catsup: Italic text can also be used. However, because some clients are incapable of rendering italic text, you will find that most clients (including those that can render italic text) display this as normal text with the background and foreground colors swapped. For this reason, it is also known as reversed text formatting and can be achieved in mIRC by pressing Ctrl-R.
16:16 +catsup: http://oreilly.com/pub/h/1953
16:17 +h4x0r`: testing
16:17 +catsup: alright then
16:17 +h4x0r`: I see
16:17 +Nei: reverse and italics are different
16:17 * grawity notes +c on this channel.
16:17 +catsup: what is +c?
16:17 +Nei: +c only affects color afaik
16:17 +Nei: server side color ex
16:17 +catsup: the server removes color codes?
16:17 +catsup: cool
16:17 +h4x0r`: +c means server doesn't display colours, ya
16:18 +grawity: I think it also removes bold and underline
16:18 +h4x0r`: or -c
16:18 +catsup: really?  this is bold, does it worK?
16:18 +grawity: Was my last message all bold and underlined?
16:18 +h4x0r`: not in mirc
16:19 +h4x0r`: i guess
16:19 +h4x0r`: it just comes down to harcoded values and formatting within the client
16:19 +h4x0r`: for anyone whos is using said client
16:19 +h4x0r`: however bold and underlines work for both
16:20 +h4x0r`: this sentence is formatted by mirc using italics
16:20 +h4x0r`: in mirc its slopes forward like italics do
16:20 +h4x0r`: i irssi it just displays [gayness
16:20 +h4x0r`: or whatever
16:20 +Nei: I guess +c strips it after all
16:20 +grawity: Ctrl-]
16:20 +Rhonda: gayness? Are you implying being gay might be something negative?
16:20 +h4x0r`: no
16:21 +grawity: Or 0x1D in hexadecimal
16:21 +Rhonda: Any troubles with your own sexuality that we should be aware of?
16:21 +h4x0r`: Rhonda, drop the gayness
16:21 +catsup: l/lastlog grawity
16:21 +Nei: whenever you see a [, just think that the following is in italics
16:21 +catsup: grawity: no
16:21 +grawity: catsup:
16:21 +grawity: er
16:22 +grawity: catsup: I checked rawlog.
16:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v JoeMaverickSett]
16:22 * catsup <3 +c
16:23 * grawity knows someone who is openly homosexual yet still uses "gay" in the negative "stupid, etc" sense.
16:24 +spb: the next version of the server software will strip mirc italics properly when +c is on, fwiw
16:24 +h4x0r`: okay well ctrl+] does produce italics when deon from irssi, mirc sees it as italics
16:24 +h4x0r`: tada

17:31 +dunpeal: billnye: the ability to type a long message, and have it posted to the channel broken down to several arbitrary paragraphs.
17:31 +Koffa: cutting lines is a Bad idea
17:31 +billnye: define "arbitrary"?
17:31 +billnye: it wasn't arbitrary in your example, it was specified
17:31 +Koffa: for most they probably show up like
17:31 +Koffa: this
17:31 +Koffa: which is annoying as
17:31 +Koffa: hell
17:31 +ferret: every time you feel like putting \n in
17:32 +ferret: press the key on your keyboard labelled "enter"
17:32 +Koffa: I'd like to get a script that puts in fewer \n's :)
17:32 +Koffa: 'premature enter' is a common problem
17:32 +dunpeal: billnye: "arbitrary" -> being defined by the user, aka me :)
17:33 +ferret: If you think you know where to put newlines in, put the actual newlines in in those places.
17:33 +dunpeal: another questions: say I have windows #foo and #bar open, what's the quickest way to jump to either by typing a partial match for the name?
17:33 +ferret: If you don't then use splitlong.pl
17:34 +dunpeal: ferret: how?  again, the key problem is putting the LF char without actually sending the message.
17:34 +ferret: /j #f<tab>
17:34 +ferret: dunpeal: why NOT sending it?
17:34 +ferret: Why not just send it?
17:34 +dunpeal: ferret: because then messages from other users may intercede.
17:34 +tmr: Sounds like that would only be useful for flooding.
17:35 +Koffa: wtf
17:35 +Koffa: there's a bugreport for it :D
17:35 +dunpeal: "So this is a really long message which I've helpfully broken down to several paragrpahs. Paragraph 1:...[LF] Paragraph 2:..."
17:35 +Koffa: ah, it's typed feature request after all
17:35 +dunpeal: ferret: thanks.

18:34 +open`: when setting up aliases, $0 I think only captures the first word given
18:34 +open`: so in /alias this is a statement
18:35 +open`: only the word 'this' would be capture -- what's the variable holder for the entire thing?
18:36 +open`: I messed up the details in my question -- but you guys get what I mean
18:36 +tmr: http://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars
18:37 +open`:  ah, so, $*
18:37 +open`: yep! thanks
18:40 +open`: one more question -- so, I have put my scripts in ~.irssi/scripts/autorun/
18:41 +open`: and they work - they're loaded up as I start irssi, but one particular one does not
18:41 +open`: any idea why that may be?
18:41 +tmr: No, not without more info.
18:41 +open`: the script in question is gtrans.pl
18:42 +open`: I'm lost for clues as well, where should I start looking into this?
18:42 +tmr: But it works when you load it manually?
18:42 +open`: yes
18:42 +open`: I should mention I have duplicates in ~.irssi/scripts/
18:42 +open`: linked, actually
18:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]
18:44 +tmr: That doesn't matter, it is actually pretty common way to handle script loading.
18:45 +Bazerka: except with the scripts in scripts/ and the links in scripts/autorun/
18:47 +Bazerka: open`: are you getting any script errors in your status window at startup?
18:47 +open`: nope, (though I'll check again for good measure)
18:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v aleX-xx]
18:47 +Bazerka: that would suggest that irssi isn't even trying to open the file then
18:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fadein]
18:48 +Bazerka: is the file/link actually named with a .pl extension?
18:49 +open`: ahh, so I have a config that starts up two servers -- the script is used in one server and not the other
18:49 +open`: and as of yet I don't know irssi enough to know how I deal with multiple 'server status windows', so I'd always had reconnect to another server. (I was using someone else's config file - that I'd be too lazy to modify)

19:10 +dunpeal: e.g. I type "foo bar", then delete bar by accident. Is there a way to get it back?
19:11 +zmx: irssi is build with readline AFAIK, try a man readline
19:11 +tmr: dunpeal, ^Y might work.
19:14 +dunpeal: tmr: it does, thanks. how do I remap it to Ctrl-/
19:15 +tmr: I doubt you can /bind Ctrl-/.
19:17 +dunpeal: I can do whatever I set my mind to.
19:17 +dunpeal: How do I get the name of the command bound to ^Y?
19:17 +tmr: /bind ^Y
19:21 +dunpeal: tmr: thanks, ^Y isn't an undo; it's a yank :S
19:21 +dunpeal: so it wouldn't work in general.
19:22 +tmr: There isn't general undo in irssi, unless of course you use the awesomeness known as vim_mode.pl
19:23 +y3llow: hi,i can only use 'left' Ctrl + arrow keys to switch channels.the right Ctrl does not work.is it possible to have it work?
19:24 +y3llow: sorry. imean alt not Ctrl.
19:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mavrc]
19:30 +dunpeal: tmr: any idea how it implement undo? :)
19:31 +Bazerka: use the proper delete binds to delete words instead of backspace?

20:57 +aic_: here is the theme in question: http://git.sysphere.org/dotfiles/tree/irssi/awesome.theme?h=public -- and here is how the status bar should look like in irssi: http://sysphere.org/gallery/albums/snapshots/awesome.png
20:59 +Nei: do you mean the windowlist above the prompt in that screenshot?
20:59 +billnye: aic_: Themes Don't Do That :)

20:59 +aic_: Nei: I'm referring to the :: 1:(status) :: 2:#archlinux :: 3:#ecryptfs ... line
21:00 +billnye: there's a basic /toggle actlist_names
21:00 +billnye: aic_: and two main scripts that offer similar functionality, advanced windowlist and chanact
21:01 +aic_: ah ok, he does mention the names of the scripts he's using in this config: http://git.sysphere.org/dotfiles/tree/irssi/config?h=public
21:01 +aic_: I suppose I'll go try to find it (though the adv_windowlist.pl script is not to be found on irssi's website)

21:55  grosboulet: I have problem with channel::nick_find_mask()... when a ban comes after kick, the nick doesn't find...
21:57 +Dirm: almost as if the user were no longer in the channel? :)
21:57  grosboulet: How can I get the nick and host ?
21:57 +vague`: That can't be.
21:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
21:58 +vague`: Listen for the kick event, save the nick and host in a hash, use it with the ban.
21:59  grosboulet: which event ? 'message kick' ?
22:00 +vague`: If there is such an event, check the docs.
22:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v open`]
22:01  grosboulet: I try to signal_stop() on 'message kick', to keep nick information, but didn(t work, I'll try to save kick in hashtable
22:02 +open`: if there's a space in the name of a file, how do I use it in a commandline? I need to basically do this: mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/kh/Go Quiet/Jonsi.iso /media/iso
22:02 +open`: but there's a space in the folder named 'Go Quiet' - and it goes unrecognized as that
22:02 +vague`: open`, not the right channel, but escape it or quote it.
22:03 +open`: 1) if not this, what would be the right channel? :O 2) how can I escape it? by quoting it, do you mean the entire path? could you give an example?
22:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
22:03 +vague`: "some path"
22:03 +open`: OHHH, this is #irssi, sorry, I thought I was in a different chan
22:04 +vague`: :)
22:04 +PsyTrance: open`: try Go\ Quiet
22:04 +vague`: And to escape the space, use the escape character.
22:04 +PsyTrance: cd /home/kh/Go\ Quiet
22:05 +open`: yep, that worked, thanks
22:05 +PsyTrance: np
22:05  grosboulet: find / -iname "*.iso" -exec rm "{}" \;
22:06 +open`: that's nice.
22:06  grosboulet: thnaks vague` for your suggestion
22:06 +vague`: What if I have a folder named something.iso ???
22:06 +vague`: s/folder/directory/
22:07  grosboulet: vague`: rm returns error
22:07 +vague`: Damn windowzinization
22:07 +vague`: Oh, right, thought it said -rf... which it really should if you want to be mean

22:37  grosboulet: How can I create a channel object ?
22:38 +vague`: $server->find_channel($channel), see the perl scripting guide
22:38 +vague`: Or channel_find(), I always mix those up
22:40  grosboulet: but this did not create channel object, but just retrieve an existant, no ?
22:40 +vague`: It creates a channel object.
22:41 +vague`: $channel is a char*
22:42  grosboulet: the function channel::destroy() exists, but not channel::create() ?
22:43  grosboulet: I want to create a fake "channel"
22:45 +vague`: You can't 'create' a channel. You can join one. But you can create a window.
22:45  grosboulet: If I do $chan = chanel_find('#irssi'); and if I modify $chan, the next time that I get #irssi's channel object my modification will be lost, right ?

22:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v atxq]

22:56 +lantana: haha
22:57  grosboulet: what ? You know me ?
22:58 * grosboulet is joking
23:01 +lestat: grosboulet: maybe you could clone an existing channel and change his name ? ^^
23:03  grosboulet: lestat: maybe this thing modify the real channel properties...
23:04 +lestat: grosboulet: if you clone the object, the properties should also get cloned right ?
23:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v bzzbzz]
23:06  grosboulet: If I modify the name of channel '#irssi", if later I try to find channel's object with find_channel('#irssi'), this should be return undef
23:07 +vague`: Irssi server/channel objects are readonly, afaik.
23:07  grosboulet: I think channel_find() retourns a reference, not a clone
23:10  grosboulet: catsup: so hash of hash and redefine nick_find_mask() ?
23:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
23:12 +catsup: wat
