00:02 +v_v: i asked a question about the ALT+1, i checked the config of xfce4-terminal, the ALT+n is set to be switch between tabs of the terminal by default, and i got no tabs. as a result, ALT+2..n works fine

00:07 +jordanm: does Alt-l/r arrow perform a different function that C-n?
00:11 +shabble: echelon: I don't think there's a built-in way, but /script exec -permanent Irssi::signal_add_first('ctcp msg', sub { Irssi::signal_stop; }); might do it.
00:11 +shabble: not sure if that would have anhy collateral damage (/me is a ctcp action, etc) though
00:12 +echelon: hmm, i remember being able to turn it off in the settings
00:12 +shabble: you can change the response to version, but I don't think there's a global disable setting
00:13 +shabble: hmm, max_ctcp_queue 0 might work
00:14 +shabble: try sending me a time or version request?

00:20 +echelon: max_ctcp_queue, just remembered :)
00:23 +echelon: hmm, but that will disable all ctcp's.. i just realized i need it for the bitlbee typing notice script :/
00:29 +shabble: well, you could tailor the ignores to have an exception for the thing you want to keep
00:29 +shabble: I'm not entirely familiar with bitlbee, does it have a distinguishable nickmask you could use for an exception?
00:30 +catsup: it has its own server
00:31 +shabble: the examples in /help ignore should show you the way, then.
00:36 +echelon: thanks
00:37 +echelon: well what're the ctcp info that the client spits out on its own

02:27 +Bazerka: you were using the lenny 0.8.14 package which was "broken"
02:27 +Bazerka: and upgrading to the 0.8.15 backport fixed the issue for you
02:27 +Bazerka: from what I can see in my log
02:27 +Bazerka: as you blamed rhonda and she didn't take it too well :)
02:27 +shabble: me?
02:27 +Bazerka: no, babar
02:27 +shabble: ah, goodgood
02:28 +Bazerka: shabble, what 0.8.14 are you using?
02:28 +Bazerka: (distro/package)
02:28 +shabble: generic debian package
02:28 +Bazerka: that's the same one babar had issues with
02:28 +Bazerka: can you upgrade to the .15 backport?
02:29 +Bazerka: I have 0.8.14 on debian which works, but that was a locally built binary
02:30 +Bazerka: heh, which amusingly, no longer works because someone has sneakily upgraded perl on that box
02:31 +Babar: ah right, now I remember
02:32 +Bazerka: given that it's demonstratably fscked for two different people, I;ll go along with your initial opinion that the package is knackered ;)
02:32 +shabble: right, got the backport
02:32 +shabble: time to cross my fingers and see if /upgrade works :)
02:33 +Bazerka: don't forget to run buf.pl and have it autorun too
02:33 +shabble: I have logresume, which I think does mostly the same thing?

02:37 +shabble: seems to have worked
02:37 +Bazerka: so this lenny box I have access to, I've upgraded the package lists and it's still telling me that 0.8.12 is the latest in the lenny repo
02:37 +Bazerka: I thought lenny had .14 in the stable repo and .15 in backports?
02:38 +shabble: yeah, it was listing .12 for me as well, but somehow I found .14 in a package
02:38 +Bazerka: and if not, where did you get that .14 package from?

02:55 +Bazerka: do you have the .deb filename?
02:56 +shabble: the package was 'irssi 0.8.14-1', but I can't find an actual file
02:56 +shabble: probably from a sid repo
02:56 +Bazerka: ah well, not that it matters
02:56 +Bazerka: problem is specific to that package and upgrading has fixed it for you :)
02:57 +shabble: yep
02:57 +shabble: and I even learned a bit about trawling through git logs to look for what might have happened

15:41 +blueyed: btw: can the color for hilight_nick_matches get configured? It is still yellow for me, but I have changed hilight_color. (not really important, I will turn hilight_nick_matches off)
