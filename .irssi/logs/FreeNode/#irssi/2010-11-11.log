03:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
03:46 +trepan: drazak: the niq.pl script?
03:46 +drazak: trepan: no, it was a setting
03:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v emma]

03:59 +drazak: tsp: do you use a screen reader? have you ever been in #sd?
03:59 +tsp: yep, that's me

04:00 +tsp: NVDA just got putty support and I"m testing it
04:00 +tsp: so far it... sorta works
04:02 +tsp: Is there no other way than right click? That's terrible
04:02 +tmr: You can change it in settings.

19:50 +Dirm: /set cmd is the irssi throttling
19:50 +Dirm: no
19:51 +Dirm: it buffers your input up to some # of bytes
19:51 +Dirm: it throttles sending those lines to the channel
19:51 +Dirm: if you hit the byte limit, though, it kicks you
