11:15 +xeon-enouf: hi there guys and gals - is there a mechanism by which i can see/notice my nickname highlighted (other than audio bells/whistles) when i'm scrolled way up in backscroll, while within same channel that i'm reading?
11:16 +xeon-enouf: i never noticed if the [status] bar would turn my channel N from white to yellow /while/ within same channel, just many lines up
11:16 --- Guest15452 is now known as RaNdY
11:17 --- RaNdY is now known as Guest75195
11:18 +vague`: It doesn't, since the item is already active. Not sure if you can hack the --more-- item to change color if there is a hilight.
11:18 +Geralt: xeon-enouf: try the hilightwin.pl script it gives you a separate window which logs all highlights
11:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kipibenkipod]
11:19 +xeon-enouf: Geralt: interesting .. thanks ... however, that's another task (switching windows) i
11:19 +xeon-enouf: d need to perform
11:20 +xeon-enouf: just to see if my nick was /recently/ highlighted in the same channel i'm reading, but days prior
11:20 +Geralt: xeon-enouf: you can show more than one window at a time with /window split and put it there (I've got it down to 3 lines)
11:21 +Geralt: no it's not called
11:21 +Geralt: split
11:21 +Geralt: it's /window new split
11:21 +xeon-enouf: Geralt: ahh .. ok, i'll try it then, thanks -- I usually scroll down /all the way/ heh, but i like my line number count when PageDown is hit to only do say 5-10 at a time only - so it becomes a nuisance to do so
11:21 +xeon-enouf: ok
11:22 +Remco: xeon-enouf: /help scrollback
11:22 +Geralt: xeon-enouf: take a look at this site http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi it explains how to set it up
11:22 +xeon-enouf: thank you all -- i appreciate the help - will do Geralt
11:23 +Remco: xeon-enouf: It allows jumping to locations/times in the buffer
11:23 +xeon-enouf: nice! ;-)
11:25 +xeon-enouf: Remco: that's really cool , heh ... never knew about that - also, i atleast have a HH:MM:SS timestamp so can be precise, however, there will be overlaps, since Days have usually passed, but no prob, just issue same command again per day ;-) ... i usually reference /where i am in reading/ using the timestamp to easily locate where i was last ;-)
11:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v aimxhaisse]
11:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ahihi]
11:26 +xeon-enouf: and sure, not everyday will have same timestamp (within seconds) within even a busy channel
11:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v icedearth]
11:27 +aimxhaisse: hi, is there a way to log the already existing activity of a window to a file?
11:27 +xeon-enouf: sure aimxhaisse
11:27 +xeon-enouf: do /help lastlog
11:27 +aimxhaisse: xeon-enouf: thanks :)
11:27 +xeon-enouf: no prob ;-)
11:28 +xeon-enouf: aimxhaisse: for example; "/lastlog -file <filename>" will dump the irssi backbuffer to file
11:29 +aimxhaisse: yes, got it, thanks for all :-)
11:29 +xeon-enouf: i generally use something like; "/lastlog -file ~/irc_logs/linux/crypto-THIS-DATE -window ##crypto -PUBLIC"
11:30 +Geralt: How can I change the format of the topic in the topicbar? topicsbstart="%Y>>" for example just sets the ">>" at the beginning to yellow
11:30 +Remco: xeon-enouf: /scrollback goto -2 18:00 will go to 18:00 2 days ago
11:31 +xeon-enouf: aimxhaisse: the PUBLIC only there is important since  i do /not/ want to log CTCPS JOINS PARTS QUITS KICKS MODES TOPICS WALLOPS NICKS DCC DCCMSGS CLIENTNOTICES CLIENTCRAP CLIENTERRORS
11:31 +xeon-enouf: Remco: sweetness ;-) thanks
11:32 +aimxhaisse: xeon-enouf: thanks for everything, I have what I wanted, I think I'll switch to autolog then :-)
11:32 +Geralt: never mind, just found out that I can set the foreground color in sb_topic_bg too
11:32 +xeon-enouf: indeed aimxhaisse ;-) i use this for example;  "/LOG OPEN -autoopen -targets ##crypto ~/IRClogs/linux/crypto-%Y-%m-%d PUBLIC"
11:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v icedearth]
11:34 +xeon-enouf: Geralt: hrm ... sb_topic_bg == status bar topic background i presume ... not such a need here for that, but sure, ok ;-)
11:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rgr_]
11:34 +xeon-enouf: ah. you wanted alternate fg color as well, i see
11:35 +Geralt: xeon-enouf: yes, and in case you ever need it: you can set in sb_topic_bg foreground color as well
11:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v rgr_]
11:35 +xeon-enouf: aimxhaisse: the /log command, on it's own will list autologging channels/filenames, etc
11:36 +xeon-enouf: nice Geralt ;-)
11:36 +Geralt: ;-)
11:39 +xeon-enouf: Remco: friggin awesome; then a simple "/sb end" jumps me to current -- as opposed to say 3 days ago ;-)
11:45 +Remco: xeon-enouf: Or even /sb e

14:21 +jink: ruskie: It doesn't _need_ screen.  You can also use fifo mode, but that requires an extra terminal to work. :)

14:24 +Ruint: i'm messing around with nm.pl
14:24 +Ruint: i like the idea of it, but i can't shake off how ugly having the indent space within the nick's < > brackets looks :/
14:25 +ruskie: I don't have that
14:26 +ruskie: neat_maxlength = 0 neat_right_mode = OFF
14:27 +ruskie: might also have some format settings
14:27 +ruskie: but for me atleast it doesn't right align
14:28 +Ruint: i've tried all the combinations of /set neat_*
14:28 +Ruint: but regardless of what i do
14:28 +Ruint: it will show up as  <+Ruint       > or  <+       Ruint>
14:29 +ruskie: hmm check nm.pl file... for the format stuff
14:29 +ruskie: Irssi::command('^format own_msg {ownmsgnick $2 {ownnick $0}}$1');
14:29 +Ruint: maxlength 0 is ugly, i'm on some servers that allow 32 char nicks
14:29 +ruskie: Irssi::command('^format own_msg_channel {ownmsgnick $3 {ownnick $0}{msgchannel $1}}$2');
14:29 +ruskie: for example what I have in my nm.pl
14:29 +ruskie: I might have removed the stuff out from there
14:30 +ruskie: similar in the other commands there
14:31 +Ruint:                 Irssi::command('^format own_msg {ownmsgnick $2 {ownnick $['.$length.']0}}$1');
14:31 +Ruint:                 Irssi::command('^format own_msg_channel {ownmsgnick $3 {ownnick $['.$length.']0}{msgchannel $1}}$2');
14:32 +ruskie: yeah... you should be able to drop the: $['.$length.']0 stuff
14:32 +ruskie: in all of them and reload the script
14:32 +Ruint: yeah, but i want my max length set to 12
14:32 +ruskie: maybe just 0 then?
14:32 +ruskie: just in case that might be related
14:33 +Ruint: i'd like to have it as  13:32 <+Ruint>        msg msg msg or
14:34 +Ruint: 13:32        <+Ruint>  msg msg
14:34 +ruskie: ow
14:34 +Geralt: What things are affected by own_msg_channel?
14:34 +Ruint: the thing that irks me is the fact that the padding is within the nick's brackets
14:36 +Ruint: reminds me of the huge xml tags people sometimes use

14:44 +billnye: Ruint: the problem is that the nick is the length that's varying
14:45 +billnye: so any "simple" theming can't say "how much longer could this variable be? okay, put that number of spaces somewhere else in the string entirely."
14:46 +billnye: http://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars
14:46 +Ruint: D:
14:47 +Ruint: makes sense, though
14:47 +Geralt: Ruint: is it possible to concatenate variables in themes, e.g. {msgnick $0$1} and then in msgnick have msgnick = "$[-9]0" which aligns the combination of $0 and $1?
14:48 +Ruint: ^.^'
14:48 +Ruint: you're asking the wrong person there, i'm afraid
14:49 +billnye: Geralt: see the link I just posted

14:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v toader]
14:50 +billnye: Ruint: I'm pretty sure what you want could be scripted... it's just not contained in the logic of just changing the width of the nick
14:51 +Geralt: billnye: I know that page, but it doesn't answer my question (unfortunately), however my tests seem to verify your answer
14:52 +Ruint: billnye: sounds like effort D:
14:52 +Ruint: i reduced the maxnick value to 9
14:52 +Ruint: looks somewhat better
14:52 +billnye: Geralt: it doesn't give your example with a "you can't do this", but nor did I see any way to accomplish that with the syntax they do demonstrate
14:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Josay_]
14:53 +Geralt: billnye: me too, and I guess that the whitespace between $0 and $1 is optional, so $0$1 and $0 $1 are interpreted in the same way

15:02 +billnye: nope, those are questionmarks even in dejavu sans mono for me
15:09 +aeon-ltd: ok, next question (sorry for the 'noob'-iness), is it possible to have regular messages aligned to the left, and have joins/quits/netsplit messages aligned to the right?
15:11 +Rhonda: Hmm, might be doable through a theme
15:11 +billnye: aeon-ltd: you mean all the way over on the right side of the window, if it was a short message?
15:11 +aeon-ltd: yes
15:12 +aeon-ltd: its possible to do separate alignments through the message types right?
15:12 +billnye: separate formats definitely
15:13 +aeon-ltd: ok, then nevermind, i'm gonna spend the next couple of hours figuring it out :)
15:13 * jink separates billnye.
15:13 +billnye: I'm trying to think if there's a "this message on the far right" way to format
15:13 +billnye: jink: mah joins!
15:13 +jink: :D
15:13 +billnye: *collapse*
15:14 +jink: :o
15:14 +billnye: aeon-ltd: take a peek through the themes page and see if you see any where the nick part of the message is on the right side of the window
15:14 +billnye: aeon-ltd: not a list of nicks down the side, that'll be something else
15:16 +Geralt: I thought I've found a way to right-align the nick, namely: join = "$*"; pad = "$[-9]0"; msgnick = "{pad {join <$*>}}:%n %|"; but it's not working as soon as you put in join the [...] between $ and 0 the string it just truncates to zero width
15:16 +aeon-ltd: billnye: ok, thanks for your help so fatr

20:03 +rhizmoe: hi all
20:03 +rhizmoe: is there a url snatcher i can graft onto irssi?
20:04 +Death4Life: try openurl.pl ? don't know if that's what you want though
20:04 +rhizmoe: not an instant-opener, if that's what that is.

20:05 +lestat: /exec grep -R http ~/irclogs/
20:05 +lestat: :P
20:05 +billnye: rhizmoe: http://scripts.irssi.org/ and googlez are good ideas
20:05 +rhizmoe: :)
20:05 +rhizmoe: yeah, checking now
20:08 +rhizmoe: openurl looks close enough, thanks!

20:59 +Remco: If it'll have the desired effect is another question
20:59 +Remco: And I can't answer that with anything else than 'try it'
21:08 +m0ar: Remco: Sure thing, I'll tell you
21:09 +m0ar: Remco: Dammit, it didn't.. Wanted it to change my perl URL-opener
21:12 +share: hm
21:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pbjorklund]
21:14 +pbjorklund: Ok this is getting strange. Lines still gets drawn on top of eachother even after: removing .irssi, reinstalling with macports.
21:14 +Remco: m0ar: Since it's perl, something like "/script exec $ENV{'TZ'}='UTC';" might help
21:17 +m0ar: Remco: I'll manage, I'll restart irssi soon enough
21:17 +Remco: :o
21:17 +Remco: irssi and restart don't belong in the same sentence :P

21:30 +Koffa: o,O
21:30 +share: oh
21:31 +Koffa: you can only do one win with that alias
21:33 +Koffa: would be kinda twisted to run irssi (that runs bitlbee to use freenode) inside irssi with ssh instead of irc-protocol (:)
21:33 +Koffa: waitwhatyousay
21:35 +share: it doesnt work
21:36 +share: how do i close the telnet connections
21:36 +share: killall telnet |
21:36 +lestat: that's not a bug in irssi
21:36 +share: !
21:36 +lestat: neither in the script
21:36 +lestat: i'd say pebcak, but it's also a kind of bug imo :P
21:38 +share: i cannot connect to telnet using irssi
21:38 +Bazerka: a bug how?
21:40 +lestat: Bazerka: i was thinking he had trouble quitting the telnet session
21:40 +lestat: cause you need to do a weird escape sequence to end the session
21:40 +Bazerka: no you don't
21:41 +Bazerka: you can instruct irssi to kill that exec
21:41 +lestat: sure
21:41 +lestat: but that's not the point
21:41 +Bazerka: so it is in no way a bug
21:41 +lestat: Bazerka: i've said it's NOT a bug in irssi
21:41 +Bazerka: you then implied that it was, kinda
21:42 +lestat: but in telnet, like a thing not very well engineered
21:42 +Bazerka: but whatever, pointless argument is pointless
21:42 +lestat: Bazerka: a bug in telnet yes
21:42 +lestat: not in isrsi
21:42 +lestat: *irssi
21:42 +Bazerka: it's not a bug in telnet that it requires escape chars to access command mode
21:42 +Bazerka: (either)
21:43 +Bazerka: I'd say that's explicitly by design
21:43 +vague`: It's a userbug to even consider using telnet.
21:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
21:43 +lestat: no but it could be a "better" escape sequence
21:44 +Bazerka: that's not a bug
21:44 +Bazerka: not even close :)
21:44 +lestat: it's an ergonomy bug imo
21:44 +lestat: but let's agree to disagree
21:44 +Bazerka: yes, let's
21:45 +Bazerka: :)

22:58 +wwalker:  /window number 3  renumbers the current window to 3
22:59 +Zed`: ^^
23:00 +billnye: /win number and /win move
23:01 +billnye: both behave as wwalker said, the difference being what happens to the other numbers
23:01 +wwalker: billnye: how did you do that without a leading space?

23:11 +mica_moca: so I need to reload said scripts each time I connect?
23:12 +lestat: mica_moca: create the folder ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/
23:12 +lestat: and then add some symlink in there to the scripts you want loaded when you start irssi
23:13 +lestat: using relative path preferably
23:13 +Zed`: mica_moca: instuctions are at http://scripts.irssi.org/
