13:54 +tmr: I think ALL is default for (status).
13:55 +dromer: fer which setting is that?

18:07 +mauke: or -p0
18:07 +kipibenkipod: yep
18:08 +kipibenkipod: so you will need to 'head patchfile' to see what is the top directory written in the top of the patchfile

18:12 +kipibenkipod: its 2 years ago. You will find it very hard to compile this verison of this irssi that this patch is for

22:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Geralt]
22:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v supercosmonaut]
22:03 +mauke: step 1: do you have a command-line audio player?
22:04 +kody: ncmpcpp is great for that :D
22:04 +kody: assuming you have mpd installed
22:04 +necktie: mauke: yes
22:04 +billnye: necktie: and is the audio file the only attention-getting measure you want? no [Act: notfication, no summary of the message elsewhere, etc
22:04 +kody: which you should...
22:04 +tmr: Not really in this case.
22:04 +kody: oh?
22:05 +necktie: billnye: sure. the more the better :)
22:05 +tmr: ncurses player is really not optimal solution to used in scripts etc..
22:05 +kody: word
22:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Geralt]
22:06 +billnye: necktie: and are the noficiations you have in mind fundamentally different in your desires than how you want messages addressed to you to be treated?
22:06 +kody: I just pair it with dzen2 and xbindkeys Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯
22:07 +necktie: billnye: i'm not really sure which other notifications i could use. i just figured an audio file would get my attention
22:08 +billnye: necktie: that's not my question
22:08 +mauke: /trigger add -publics -privmsgs -actions -pattern 'yourwordhere' -command 'exec - mplayer ~/sounds/ding.wav'
22:08 +billnye: re-read'd'd'd'
22:08 +mauke: completely untested
22:09 +necktie: billnye: messages addressed to me don't have to be treated any special kind of way. just want to be notified
22:10 +billnye: necktie: my question is "are you asking for a special class of messages handled/treated/notified differently and independently of the methods that are or could or would be used to notify you that you're being talked at"
22:10 +necktie: mauke: 16:10 -!- Irssi: Unknown option: actions
22:11 +mauke: hah, nice
22:11 +mauke: replace by -pubactions -privactions
22:14 +necktie: billnye: basically, the messages i need to be notified about won't be directed to me personally. they're just words that will make me want to look into that channel
22:14 +necktie: mauke: type noob just to see if it works
22:14 +billnye: necktie: you're still SO missing the point
22:15 +necktie: billnye: lol i am very confused by your question
22:15 +mauke: noob
22:15 +billnye: I'm not asking if they'll contain your nick, I'm asking about your request (as a class of messages) vs. people talking directly to you (as a class of messages)
22:15 +necktie: mauke: it's trying to work. the trigger usage popped up in this channel
22:16 +billnye: I'm asking whether you want those two classes of mesages to be treated similarly, and if not how much overlap in your desires.
22:17 +necktie: billnye: oh i see. yes. i'd like them to be treated exactly the same
22:17 +billnye: you're asking for (and responding "sure!" to suggestions about) features that are TYPICALLY applied to "people talking to me" messages
22:17 +billnye: but the method irssi would typically use for specifying "important" doesn't have to be based on your nick
22:18 +necktie: billnye: well these people won't be talking to me at all
22:18 +billnye: necktie: again, totally irrelevant to a) irssi b) my question and c) your wishes
22:18 +billnye: :D
22:18 +billnye: I recommend skipping the trigger, adding your important terms (along with your nick(s) ) to /hilight, and configuring hilights to do whatever notification you desire
22:19 +billnye: which can include any of beeps, audio, icon flashing for minimized irssi, summary of message in another irssi window or onscreen popup, etc.
22:20 +mauke: how do you make hilights do that?
22:20 +billnye: as well as color/priority in [Act: ] and meta-a
22:20 +necktie: alright. can you help me with that?
22:20 +billnye: necktie: start with getting the stuff you want into /hilight
22:20 +necktie: for right now. i'd just like it to play audio
22:20 +billnye: necktie: start with getting the stuff you want into /hilight
22:21 +billnye: mauke: that was a lot of "thats", what are you asking about?
22:21 +mauke: "configuring hilights to do whatever notification you desire"
22:21 +mauke: which probably involves running random system commands
22:22 +billnye: mauke: there are scripts for most of the "random" commands you would want to run
22:22 +necktie: billnye: okay. done
22:23 +ezzieyguywuf: billnye: _no_ change
22:24 +billnye: ezzieyguywuf: are you trying to move the window in a direction that it has a split to go into?
22:24 +ezzieyguywuf: billnye: ah, so first I need to create the split then?
22:24 +billnye: ezzieyguywuf: um no
22:24 +billnye: you were asking how to hide
22:24 +billnye: which is UNDOING a split
22:25 +ezzieyguywuf: billnye: I think we got our wires crossed. but creating the split and then moving did exactly what I wanted. Thank you for your (inadvertent) help!
22:25 +billnye: necktie: does irssi do anything detectable (flash, blink, beep, buzz, whir) when you issue a /beep command?
22:26 +billnye: ezzieyguywuf: then /wc the window when you're done
22:26 +billnye: (the spare one you created to initiate the split)
22:27 +necktie: billnye: it just does a single beep. i'm going to need it to do more than that. because i might be in another room and i won't hear the single beep
22:27 +billnye: necktie: that's fine. we're going step by step here ;P
22:27 +necktie: alright :)
22:28 +billnye: /set beep
22:28 +billnye: /help levels
22:29 +billnye: and then set beep_msg_level to something that includes HILIGHTS and any other message level that you want to throw in with this attention-grabbing
22:29 +billnye: MSGS is a possibility
22:31 +necktie: billnye: so /set beep_msg_level PUBLIC ??
22:31 +mauke: that would make irssi beep on every message
22:32 +necktie: oh lol
22:32 +necktie: billnye: so /set beep_msg_level HILIGHT ??
22:32 +billnye: try HILIGHT MSG on for size and change if you don't like it
22:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Daniel]
22:33 +necktie: billnye: wouldn't that just be private messages?
22:33 +billnye: it takes a space-separated list of levels
22:33 +billnye: I'm suggesting at least that list of two
22:34 +necktie: i think i get it now. so HILIGHT PUBLIC would probably be what i need
22:34 +billnye: no
22:34 +billnye: the publics you want will fall under hilights if you have /hilight set up properly
22:34 +mauke: I have beep_msg_level = DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT
22:34 +necktie: wouldn't highlight public make it beep for highlighted words in public chat?
22:35 +mauke: it's an OR, not AND
22:35 +mauke: my irssi beeps when it gets a DCC message or when something is highlighted
22:36 +billnye: mine is a little more liberal, MSGS NOTICES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT
22:36 +mauke: notices? you're crazy
22:37 +billnye: nah, if a bot's yakking at me, it's something I at least want to be aware of
22:37 +billnye: chances are a server connection has died
22:38 -#irssi- mauke: it doesn't have to be "at you"
22:38 +bburhans: mauke: eh?
22:38 +billnye: mauke: I know, we've had this discussion :)
22:38 +open: wait, do that notice again please
22:38 -#irssi- mauke: also, I need a short alias for /notice *
22:38 +billnye: doesn't have to, but in sane situations it is :)
22:39 +necktie: billnye: okay. i've done /set beep_msg_level HILIGHT MSG
22:39 +billnye: necktie: does this beep?
22:39 +necktie: yes
22:40 +billnye: okay, next step (sounds) is to either change your terminal settings to play a different sound on terminal beeps
22:41 +billnye: or pick a script from the handful at http://scripts.irssi.org/ that would make irssi (and only irssi) behave differently on beep
22:44 +necktie: billnye: alright. try now
22:44 +billnye: necktie: no
22:45 +necktie: not working
22:46 +necktie: once more
22:46 +billnye: necktie: one for the money
22:47 +necktie: hmm. here's what i did. i downloaded http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/beep.pl . then i did /set beep_command afplay /Users/necktie/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/test.mp3
22:48 +necktie: still not working
22:49 +billnye: does "/exec afplay /Users/necktie/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/test.mp3" work?
22:50 +necktie: yes
22:50 +necktie: how do i stop it?
22:50 +necktie: nvm
22:52 +necktie: billnye: try now
22:52 +billnye: nanananecktie
22:52 +necktie: ope
22:52 +necktie: nope
22:53 +necktie: that didn't highlight tho
22:53 +billnye: then you haven't added your nick to /hilight :)
22:53 +billnye: and if people say, by the way, necktie... you won't know
22:53 +necktie:  /hilight necktie
22:54 +necktie: fail
22:54 +necktie: try now
22:54 +billnye: and if people say, by the way, necktie... you won't know
22:54 +necktie: nope
22:54 +billnye: you probably want to /toggle hilight_nick_matches, now that you've got a proper /hilight on
22:55 +necktie: try one more time
22:56 +billnye: necktie: hit me baybee
22:56 +billnye: (one more time)
22:56 +necktie: nope :'(
22:56 +billnye: try playing something with a simpler path
22:57 +necktie: 16:56 hilight_nick_matches = OFF
22:57 +necktie: is that correct?
22:57 +billnye: yep, it was on before
22:57 +necktie: so now it might work?
22:57 +billnye: no change to our issue, no
22:58 +billnye: it would just cause other weirdness as hilight_nick_matches and /hilight fought over some messages
22:59 +billnye: maybe put something in /Users/necktie/ instead
23:00 +necktie: okay. try
23:00 +billnye: necktie:
23:00 +necktie: nope
23:01 +billnye: any messages of interest over in status?
23:01 +necktie: nope
23:01 +billnye: scripts
23:01 +billnye: oops
23:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v twiggy]
23:01 +necktie: billnye: i'm typing this /set beep_command /exec afplay /Users/necktie/test.mp3
23:01 +necktie: is that correct?
23:02 +billnye: no, it wants a shell command by the look of the default on the setting
23:02 +billnye: but have you changed beep_when_not_away yet?
23:02 +necktie: no
23:03 +billnye: if that's still false, then you have an easy roadblock to clear ;P
23:03 +necktie: 17:03 beep_when_not_away = ON
23:03 +necktie: when i did toggle
23:03 +billnye: okay
23:03 +billnye: necktie:
23:03 +necktie: nothing
23:04 +billnye: what's your beep_command at now?
23:04 +billnye: I think you can test this all yourself with /beep , since that's what the script seems to be catching
23:04 +necktie:  /exec afplay /Users/necktie/test.mp3
23:04 +billnye: I said no exec :)
23:05 +necktie: 
23:05 +necktie: it worked when i did /beep
23:05 +billnye: (what was that?)
23:05 +billnye: necktie:
23:05 +necktie: but, it froze
23:05 +necktie: me
23:05 +necktie: worked again
23:05 +necktie: but i can't type in irssi until i kill the process
23:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v chrislerum]
23:06 +billnye: try adding a & to the end of the command ;)
23:06 +necktie: there we go :)
23:06 +billnye: (again, something demonstrated in the example/default value of beep_command)
23:06 +necktie: worked perfect now
23:07 +billnye: some other possibilities you might consider are hilightwin (http://billnye.blinkenshell.org/irssi/putty20080818.png) for at-a-glance overview of what's been hilighting you
23:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Qvist_]
23:09 +necktie: nice. i'll check that out. so now, say i add "call of duty" to hilight. will the song play even if my name is not mentioned?
23:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v orafu]
23:10 +billnye: if that phrase is all you add to the hilight criteria, then yep
23:11 +billnye: hilight has ways of limiting what/where/when it will be triggered, if that's helpful
23:14 +necktie: also, is it possible to add different songs for different triggers? for example, i would like the normal beep for when someone typed my name. but for certain phrases, i'd like the song to play
23:16 +necktie: that one isn't a big deal, but it'd be a nice option to have
23:18 +billnye: that gets into the "how and where do you want those classes to differ" question I asked initially
23:19 +billnye: if the audio was the only change among the behaviors that you want to vary, then taking the audio out of the /hilight domain and perhaps putting it back on /trigger
23:19 +billnye: leaving /hilight to handle the other common aspects
