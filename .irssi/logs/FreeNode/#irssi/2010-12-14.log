13:11 +tommylommykins: I am aware of the activity printout on the second-line up from the bottom...
13:11 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: do you notice a color change in (activity) your StatusBar
13:11 +tommylommykins: but it's a little hard to notice when something new appears
13:12 +tommylommykins: xeon-enouf: Yeah, but I still tend not to see things..
13:12 * tommylommykins wants big flashing lights and an airraid siren
13:12 +grawity: /set beep_
13:12 +xeon-enouf: yeah -- i concur -- doesn't bother me much though - especially even when my bar is full-to-the-max with over 25 channels, :-P
13:12 +tommylommykins: Is there anything quick and painless that I can do to make things more obvious
13:13 +tommylommykins: hmm, it's a bit onnoying when people PM me, I don't notice the PM, but we're happily chatting away in a channel
13:13 +tommylommykins: annoying
13:13 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: seen grawity 's comment? ^ ^
13:14 * tommylommykins might have deliberately ignored it :(
13:14 +tommylommykins: IRC is my primary timewaster in lectures atm
13:14 +xeon-enouf: i _really_ used to loathe some irc clients i used to use, where the PM would just override the focus on me :-p

13:16 +grawity: But there's still a GUI, isn't there?
13:16 +grawity: Also, you can turn on "visual bell" on your terminal emulator.
13:16 +grawity: == window flashes instead of beeping
13:17 +tommylommykins: set the beep on irssi, and then set visual bell?
13:17 +grawity: Yeah
13:18 * tommylommykins will investigate :)
13:18 +tommylommykins: I assume that gets messed up if I'm not looking at the screen at the time
13:18 +tommylommykins: :(
13:18 +grawity: What OS are you using?
13:18 +tommylommykins: Ubuntu
13:19 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: perhaps a stungun attachment is what you need :-P
13:19 +grawity: On your computer?
13:19 +tommylommykins: lol
13:19 +tommylommykins: grawity: Yes? ...What else might I be using it on?
13:19 +grawity: tommylommykins: Run `notify-send test` - would that kind of notifications work?
13:19 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: wear headphones and use just the audio beep_ / bell?
13:20 +xeon-enouf: wait .. erm .. that would mean not paying attention to said lecture :-)
13:20 +tommylommykins: xeon-enouf: Wearing headphones in academic lectures?
13:20 +tommylommykins: yeah
13:20 +tommylommykins: just a little bit...
13:20 +grawity: IRCing in academic lectures?
13:20 +iaj: while we are talking about notifications - can someone recommen a nice script to me (or fragment for trigger.pl) to have notifications on Mac OSX?  like with growl? couldn't find anything that worked until yet
13:20 +grawity: otoh, I IRCed during the last English test, so I'll shut up.
13:20 +xeon-enouf: heh
13:21 +tommylommykins: grawity: Of course.. Wouldn't have enough stress and panic just before the start of my exam periods if I actually paid attention..
13:21 +grawity: iaj: I have a notification script, would be easy to adapt to Growl
13:21 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: grawity can the visual bell be set to flash/beep consistently until user does someaction?
13:21 +iaj: grawity: can you share :-)
13:21 +grawity: xeon-enouf: Depends on the program
13:22 +xeon-enouf: tommylommykins: so, if not looking at screen, doesn't matter -- PM or otherwise :-)

13:23 +tommylommykins: mmm, would be nice
13:24 +xeon-enouf: hrm .. now i have a question -- from much earlier; concerning just having URLs stand out (highlighted) apart from rest of text; i already use nickcolors.pl - and no need to have URLs launchable, etc
13:25 +xeon-enouf: do i have to encode/set something pertaining to (irssi's) colors, and regex?
13:26 +xeon-enouf: (so maybe as to pluck out / match "http|www|//" or something)
13:28 +grawity: iaj: I added Mac::Growl to the script. 40% chance for it to be working.
13:28 +iaj: thanks.. grawity I'm at work currently but I'm def gonna check it out soon

13:44 +Bzek_: Thank you.
13:54 +xeon-enouf: apologies, important phone call -- anyways; i don't think URLs have anything to do with nickcolors.pl, but searching scripts.irssi.org doesn't yield what i'm looking for -- the reference to nickcolors was just that it alters coloring of certain text(s)
13:54 +xeon-enouf: deryni: ^
13:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v giantkiar]
13:57 +giantkiar: hi there
13:58 +deryni: I don't know of any scripts that do that, but there are a number that log/catch/etc. urls. Your terminal can also do that (and likely make it clickable) if you use one that supports that.
14:04 +xeon-enouf: deryni: thing is; (atleast using an xterm/mrxvt) i can easily doubleclick on URL, (or any word/text until it has whitespace, etc) such as URLs, and have that copied to my clipboard for pasting into browser address bar, just, i'd like to easily see URLs (have them oh say; all in BLUE) - but ok, thanks
14:04 * xeon-enouf is big on various colorizations for visual cues, and easy to find infos
14:05 +deryni: It should be possible to do I think, I just don't know of any plugins that do it. Most of the ones people want tend to be of the find-and-open (or make easy to open with a command) variety.
14:05 +xeon-enouf: sure .. understood .. maybe i'll just try one of those then -- Can you recommend a/the *least* intrusive one?
14:07 +deryni: I haven't used any of them really.
14:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Xilov]
14:09 +Nei: maybe trigger could be used to easily hilight urls
14:09 +Nei: just make a regex that adds underline in front

15:20 +r4_: can levels be broken down to the level of channel specific level settings?
15:21 +billnye: r4_: I don't follow the question
15:21 +r4_: for instance....i want to have joins/parts/quits to be shown in status except for one channel
15:22 +billnye: I have a joins/parts/quits window myself, for all but one channel
15:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v przemoc]
15:22 +r4_: really i want to have specific level settings for each window individually
15:22 +billnye: to pull levels that "belong" to a window item away, you need /set window_check_level_first
15:22 +r4_: yeah
15:22 +r4_: the first time i tried this...it was a disaster :)
15:23 +billnye: read coekie's guide/notes well, set up all your /window level-s first, then turn it on
15:23 +r4_: ok
15:23 +r4_: yeah i think i need to do some more reading
15:23 +billnye: printlevels.pl used sparingly can be helpful to track down any messages that seem to be mis-routed from what you want
15:24 +billnye: with wclf on, you're basically re-working irssi's message routing system, so a lot of extra configuration has to be done to get it to work "right", depending what you want
15:25 +billnye: (a little bit of extra... but it's more than just flipping a switch)
15:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fender0107401]
15:31 +r4_: understandable
15:31 +r4_: i pretty much want the default minus a few tweaks
15:31 +r4_: err
15:31 +r4_: with a few tweaks :)
15:32 +billnye: r4_: yes, but those "few tweaks" are going to require more than a few tweaks, is my point

15:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zed`]
15:39 +billnye: what level script?
15:39 +r4_: keep it on for awhile (take notes) then setup the windows accordingly
15:39 +billnye: ah
15:39 +billnye: <nod>
15:39 +r4_: printlevels.pl?
15:39 +billnye: I'd say it's better for correction than observation, but if you have a really wide terminal...
15:42 +r4_: i think first i should just do some reading...after my final today :)
15:42 +r4_: its over a bunch of fun math =]
15:42 +billnye: r4_: you just need to set a sensible default_window_level for your wishes, then manually set levels on your windows
15:43 +r4_: so would you say setting ALL for all windows and subtracting things would be the best method? or just adding the appropriate levels?
15:49 +billnye: I think it gets translated to longhand when you do the other, give it a try

15:58 +billnye: fapster: adjusting your paste settings is the most sensible first step, if that's what you mean
15:59 +billnye: fapster: if it's a channel you absolutely don't want to make a peep in, some #idlerpg thing, you can put another window item in the window and switch input to that

16:13 +zachlr_: Myrtti: right now, I only seem to be receiving messages from #irssi, for example
16:13 +zachlr_: I guess that's how it's supposed to be though
16:14 +zachlr_: It would be confusing in a single window.
16:14 +Myrtti: zachlr_: well you can join other channels with the normal /join #channel command, and switch between the windows with meta-1, meta-2 etc or meta-a, or ctrl-n and ctrl-p
16:14 +Myrtti: (meta is usually mapped to esc but also alt)
16:14 +zachlr_: I'm familiar with mIRC, as you might have guessed :) so I'm totally dumbfounded here.
16:15 +xeon-enouf: Nei: ok, i'll look into trigger and/or scipting a regex
16:15 +zachlr_: how do I see what channels I'm in?
16:15 +yitz_: Bottom line - the input "box" - usually has the active channel item
16:16 +Myrtti: zachlr_: the channels are referenced with numbers after "Act:" on the bottom and they hilight with different colours depending on the level of activity
16:17 +Myrtti: well, not only channels, windows in general
16:17 +zachlr_: a window is any output, such as server, channel, dcc, I guess?
16:18 +Myrtti: or msg yes
16:19 +xeon-enouf: albacker: you can set the number of lines a PageUp/Down scrolls; '/set scroll_page_count=10' for scrolling 10 lines at a time, say .. "/set" by itself will list all settable items, under various SubTopic Titles... Also '/set scroll' is how i easily found that specific setting
16:19 +zachlr_: how might I see a list of windows?
16:21 +xeon-enouf: zachlr_: i use Alt + Left/Right Arrows (a lot) to quickly cycle through them
16:21 +yitz_: There's also alt-a to jump to a window with activity
16:21 +xeon-enouf: read the names in input area, or in statusbar

16:22 +yitz_: ctrl+p/n ?
16:22 +zachlr_: nope
16:23 +xeon-enouf: alt + {1,2.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,q,w,e,r,t,y...} ?
16:23 +zachlr_: window list shows only #irssi, but I'm getting messages from another channel on another server
16:23 +xeon-enouf: is your Alt screwy? :-p perhaps a Laptop? needs, some Fn funk?
16:23 +yitz_: One window with all items in it?
16:23 +Myrtti: zachlr_: try esc instead of alt
16:24 +xeon-enouf: yeah, Alt is ESC+, or somesuch
16:24 +yitz_: How many items does it show when you do: /window
16:24 +zachlr_: I think it's because irssi is only recognizing one window.  /window list shows only this channel.
16:24 +xeon-enouf: IOW, hit ESC, then other key(s) -- with Alt, you press and holf
16:24 +xeon-enouf: hold*
16:25 +xeon-enouf: try _other_ Alt key? maybe -- tried both?
16:25 +zachlr_: xeon-enouf: I can't get anything to work
16:25 +xeon-enouf: heck, i'm using a Macintosh keyboard on an old p4, and it even works :-p
16:25 +xeon-enouf: ok
16:26 +xeon-enouf: Reboot!!! (j/k :-p)
16:26 +yitz_: Maybe one window with all items in it? How many items does it show when you do: /window

16:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v takanheim]
16:27 +zachlr_: it shows one window, but shows three channels

16:27 +yitz_: ^x I think
16:28 +xeon-enouf: and the Right Alt ==     108         0xffea (Alt_R)  0xffe8 (Meta_R) 0xffea (Alt_R)  0xffe8 (Meta_R) 0xffea (Alt_R)  0xffe8 (Meta_R)
16:28 +yitz_: I think there's a setting to put new channels in new windows? Or you can manually move them out
16:28 +zachlr_: you can only read one window at a time though, right?
16:29 +yitz_: Yeah. A window is like a tab in mIRC
16:29 +yitz_: I gotta scamper
16:29 +billnye: zachlr_: everything all combined isn't the default in irss
16:29 +xeon-enouf: would autocreate_windows = ON help?
16:30 +billnye: zachlr_: what OS/Distro are you on?
16:30 +billnye: zachlr_: (and what window number are we in?)
16:30 +zachlr_: linux... okay windows vista :(
16:30 +xeon-enouf: ...
16:30 +zachlr_: umm, #1?
16:31 +zachlr_: 1:freenode/#irssi
16:31 +zachlr_: signifies window 1, correct?
16:31 +Dice-Man: yeah
16:31 +billnye: zachlr_: yep
16:31 +billnye: zachlr_: you didn't by any chance read the startup howto?
16:31 +Dice-Man: use /window goto # to navigate throught windows

16:34 +ecrist: so, do I need to use the proper control codes, then, billnye ?
16:34 +billnye: zachlr_: somehow your autocreate_windows got turned off, and we don't know if other things are non-standard in addition to that

16:36 +xeon-enouf: zachlr_: also, as Dice-Man mentioned "/window goto N" might be aliased to "/wgt N" (atleast it is here -- "/alias" will output all your aliases -- note most do *not* require CAPs even)
16:36 +zachlr_: I only have one window though
16:36 +xeon-enouf: (/alias, when run while viewing [status] -- which _should be #1_)
16:37 +xeon-enouf: but .. not sure what's wrong precisely -- billnye et al know their shit, so follow their lead
16:38 +xeon-enouf: zachlr_: '/window goto 1' should show you; [(status)]
16:38 +xeon-enouf: in input area/field
16:38 +billnye: zachlr_: at this point you haven't customized much at all, am I right?
16:39 +zachlr_: billnye: this is my first time running it.
16:39 +xeon-enouf: zachlr_: following my suggestion and billnye 's lead; try /set autocreate_windows=ON
16:39 +zachlr_: done.
16:40 +xeon-enouf: and then /exit (or /quit) , perhaps and relaunch it -- i guess
16:40 +billnye: xeon-enouf: shh :)
16:40 +xeon-enouf: heh .. ok :-p
16:40 +zachlr_: restart irssi now?
16:40 +billnye: zachlr_: no.
16:40 * xeon-enouf defers
16:41 +billnye: zachlr_: I'd try running a separate instance with "irssi --config /dev/null"
16:41 +zachlr_: after setting autocreate_windows=ON, and /j #ubuntu, new channels still seem to be going to the first window
16:41 +billnye: zachlr_: were you already joined to ubuntu?
16:41 +billnye: if so, then nothing's behaving oddly there
16:42 +zachlr_: autocreate windows should have caused /j #ubuntu to open a new window, right?
16:42 +billnye: not if you were already joined to ubuntu, no.
16:42 +zachlr_: billnye: I wasn't until after I set autocreat to on
16:43 +billnye: zachlr_: you probably want to start off with irssi's defaults, and given that at least one of your settings was non-standard, and you're not sure what if anything was changed, starting from scratch is probably a good idea
16:43 +billnye: zachlr_: what about /j #zachlr

17:42 +billnye: zachlr___: just don't go entering commands!
17:42 +billnye: :)
17:42 +zachlr___: haha, alright
17:43 +billnye: zachlr___: it's unfortunate that the first portion of the startup howto isn't geared toward newbies, it's geared toward command line oldbies who want irssi to behave like an older client did
17:43 +billnye: zachlr___: that same issue has claimed more than just yourself, definitely
17:44 +billnye: zachlr___: as long as you skip over the "make irssi behave like ircii" part, the other bits like server and channel automation are helpful
17:45 +zachlr___: billnye: Okay.  As I said, mIRC is the only client I've used for an extended period of time, so I don't need to worry about that part.

21:43 +excelsior: ok
21:43 +mauke: it's in a config file language
21:43 +mauke: homebrew
21:44 +Bazerka: it resembles perl, but it's not actually perl
21:44 +billnye: mauke: what is that like some kind of Hebrew homeboy?
21:44 +excelsior: so irssi defines it
21:44 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 109 seconds
21:44 +mauke: excelsior: well, more like it just uses it
21:45 +mauke: it's not documented or anything
21:45 +excelsior: really? not documented at all?
21:46 +billnye: not exhaustively, and not very well nor very up-to-date-ly
21:46 +billnye: hence one of the main reasons for the advice in the topic ;)
21:47 +excelsior: ok, what's that advice again?
21:47 +excelsior:  /topic gives the topic
21:47 +excelsior: so nm
21:48 +excelsior: OK FINE! I won't edit it by hand, geez. That's what backups are for
21:49 +billnye: excelsior: we're just answering your questions. we don't support the editing or the aftermath of doing so, though

22:07 +excelsior: sweet, so now I have the ubuntu channel going on another hidden window, and I have several slow channels going in this one. Now to create split windows and stuff...
22:10 +excelsior: you know what, now that I'm looking at the aliases, maybe I gave the /manual-windows command...
22:10 +excelsior: The problem with that command is it saves by default
22:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v marowit]
22:14 +billnye: or that tjere
22:14 +billnye: there's no way for it to know what your settings were before
22:14 +Bazerka: excelsior: that alias is the spawn of the devil
22:14 +billnye: it's not designed to be temporary
22:14 +Bazerka: billnye: no default alias should /save imo
22:15 +excelsior: lol
22:15 +Bazerka: if you want the behaviour supplied by one, you should /save manually, because that will give you the opportunity to /reload should you not like the new behaviour
22:15 +Bazerka: (prior to saving)
22:16 +excelsior: still laughing at "spawn of the devil"
22:16 +Bazerka: I have an automatic-windows alias to restore the default behaviour after having run /manual-windows - you wouldn't believe how many times people run it blindly
22:16 +excelsior: I think it would be good advice for people to look at the config file, even if they don't edit it
22:17 +excelsior: ok, so why does it save?

23:37 +Bazerka:  /help hilight
23:37 +Rebellen: ok
23:37 +Bazerka: and perhaps /hilight Rebellen
23:38 +Rebellen: the nick turns yellow, but not bold
23:38 +Bazerka: you can specify what you want with various options to /hilight
23:38 +Rebellen: and my nick sint bold in the chat if you know what i mean, hard to see my lines :P
23:38 +Bazerka: as described in the help
23:39 +Bazerka: what you're talking about there is a theming issue
23:39 +Rebellen: Bazerka: but that doesnt help be to get my nick bold in the cat right?
23:39 +Rebellen: chat*
23:39 +Bazerka: you're talking about two seperate issues
23:39 +Rebellen: i know
23:40 +Bazerka: the first is when someone hilights you and that's taken care of by /hilight
23:40 +Bazerka: the second is the formatting of your own nick for your own messages
23:40 +Bazerka: and that's taken care of by theming
23:41 +Rebellen: i tried /HILIGHT -color %G but that didnt make my nick bold, %G should make it bold right?
23:41 +Rebellen: Bazerka: whre in the theme is that do you think?
23:42 +Bazerka: can you read what I just told you? :)
23:42 +Rebellen: ownnick?
23:42 +Rebellen: i have it this way in the theme but its not bold anyway ownnick = "%W$*%n";
23:42 +Bazerka: ownnick or ownmsgnick (which are defined in your theme file)
23:44 +Bazerka: what do you have for ownmsgnick?
23:44 +Rebellen: ownmsgnick = "{msgnick $0 $1-}";
23:45 +Bazerka: and for msgnick?
23:45 +Rebellen: msgnick = "%K<%n$0$1-%K>%n %|";

23:46 +Rebellen: pattern not found
23:46 +Bazerka:  /format own_msg_channel
23:47 +Rebellen: own_msg_channel = {ownmsgnick $3 {ownnick $0}{msgchannel $1}}$2

23:48 +Rebellen: $ mv default.theme default.theme.bak
23:48 +Rebellen: then i /reload
23:48 +Rebellen: now my nick is bold
23:49 +Rebellen: the hilights isn't bold but we'll fix that
23:50 +Bazerka: ownnick = "%W$*%n"; should work
23:50 +Rebellen: why? didnt i fix the problem?
23:51 +Rebellen: my nick is bold now
23:51 +Rebellen: i just removed the theme
23:51 +Rebellen: and this was my default setting in the theme
23:51 +Rebellen: ownnick = "%W$*%n";
23:51 +Rebellen: same as your's right?
23:51 +Bazerka: so it's reverted to ownnick = "%_$*%n";
23:51 +Bazerka: that's the default
23:52 +Rebellen: and it works
23:52 +Bazerka: yes, but I'm saying there's no reason why it wasn't working before
23:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vvsh]
23:52 +Bazerka: other than your terminal is perhaps configured to not display bold white
23:52 +Rebellen: well it didnt
23:54 +Bazerka: I've just set mine to ownnick = "%W$*%n"; and it's bolding white
23:54 +Rebellen: alright
23:55 +Rebellen: but the hilight thing doesnt work
23:55 +Rebellen: i have /hilight -color %Y mynick but it isnt working

23:57 +Rebellen: i see no bold?
23:57 +Bazerka: that white is bold white
23:58 +Rebellen: alright
23:58 +Bazerka: the channel text is standard white
23:58 +Rebellen: but nuff about that
23:58 +Rebellen: i wanna have yellow bold when someone hilights me
23:58 +Rebellen: i have set this /hilight -color %Y mynick
