19:55 +azizLIGH1S: how to turn off autojoin on invite
19:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zucca]
19:56 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 92 seconds
19:57 +jnpplf: /set join_auto_chans_on_invite
20:00 +azizLIGH1S: how can i join certain channels on invite
20:00 +azizLIGH1S: and not all channels on any invite
20:00 +jnpplf: Hmm, not sure if you can
20:01 +jnpplf: Might require a script like trigger.pl
20:01 +jnpplf: But I will defer to someone that knows more
20:01 +azizLIGH1S: someone is abusing invitejoin.pl and i cant leave their channel, they keep inviting me back
20:01 +azizLIGH1S: i had to turn it off to leave :/
20:03 +jnpplf: You could maybe ignore invites from that person?
20:03 +Koffa: wtf
20:03 +Koffa: why would anyone invite someone back?-i
20:03 +Koffa: unwanted
20:03 +azizLIGH1S: spam channel i guess
20:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vague`]
20:03 +azizLIGH1S: trolls
20:03 +azizLIGH1S: jnpplf: its different bots inviting back
20:03 +Koffa: there are guns...
20:04 +jnpplf: Ignore all of them?
20:04 +azizLIGH1S: theres a lot of them man
20:04 +Koffa: azizLIGH1S: single chan?
20:04 +azizLIGH1S: yes
20:05 +jnpplf: Do they have a common mask or something?
20:05 +Koffa: /ignore -pattern #channel ...
20:05 +Koffa: would it work?
20:05 +azizLIGH1S: lol im not going back into that channel
20:05 +azizLIGH1S: to check
20:07 +Koffa: I'd try the ignore, I have no idea if that -pattern would match invites but it's easy to test :)

20:12 +azizLIGH1S: i just made an alias to turn ooff the invjoin.pl script and set join_auto_chans_on_invite = off and vice versa

20:21 +lilibox: is irssi's running as proxy security comparable to ZNC?
20:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v niko]
20:22 +lilibox: and i would like to know if everything i will newly set in irssi, irssi will "remember" for next time? or do i must it special save/tell to irssi?
20:23 +lilibox: i.e. i added /load proxy ....
20:23 +Koffa: /save
20:23 +Koffa: /load's go to .irssi/startup iirc
20:23 +lilibox: i use some .pl scripts but i must every time type 2 commands as preparation
20:24 +Koffa: scripts are symlinked to .irssi/scripts/autorun
20:24 +lilibox: i would like to set irssi as autonome proxy, running without human touching :)
20:24 +Koffa: these are all in the startup guide
20:24 +lilibox: koffa ok
20:24 +lilibox: well, ie. i use twirrsi for twitter
20:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v beeman_nl]
20:25 +lilibox: but everytime i type /window new hidden and then /window name twitter before i load script
20:25 +Koffa: /layout save   saves windows etc
20:25 +lilibox: aha
20:25 +Koffa: I have one immortal window on index 100 for bitlbee
20:25 +lilibox: soo /save is not universal which will store all include UI variables
20:26 +Koffa: layout is separate beast :)
20:26 +lilibox: i will read some docs
20:26 +Koffa: handy when you don't want to save random queries
20:26 +Koffa: just /settings
20:26 +lilibox: soo, and one important thing, selfrecovering
20:26 +lilibox: i will put irssi on debian
20:26 +Koffa: if the server reboots, crontab helps
20:26 +Koffa: @reboot screen -d -m irssi

21:20 +ealexp: ReDAeR: use the /hilight command

22:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tyebud]
22:36 +vague`: Not sure if you can use variable expansion, in that case something like $[-1]0.log might work. (if I am thinking correctly) you can verify it by looking at http://irssi.org/documentation/special_vars

23:18 +Datz: Hi, I'm using irssi in a non graphical environment. Is there a way to copy text from within a bash terminal?
23:18 +Datz: eg; copy a link from within irssi, and paste into lynx
23:19 +Flyoc: Datz: are you using screen ?
23:19 +athit: Datz: use gnu screen copy mode maybe?
23:20 +Datz: ok, I thought screen might have such ability. I'll look into it. thanks
23:20 +Datz: btw, do both apps have to be running in screen?
23:21 +athit: yes they need to share the same screen session
23:21 +Datz: oh.. ok thanks
23:21 +athit: in screen the escape is ^A + ESC
23:21 +Datz: be nice if they could go from one session to another
23:22 +Datz: thanks
23:22 +athit: you need a shared buffer somewhere...
23:22 +Datz: yea
23:24 +fujisano: yea
23:24 +fujisano: Datz:  :D
23:24 +athit: is there an irssi script to limit the messages of joining/leaving users on a specific channel?
23:24 +fujisano: Datz:  you like the sun?
23:24 +Datz: humm, sun
23:24 +fujisano: Datsun
23:24 +Datz: fujisano: only during the day
