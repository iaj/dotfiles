01:05 +Jfrost: hello, sorry this is probably a dumb question but i've googled arond and read start docs, however, when trying to connect to a server with a self signed cert irssi always disconnects me so the command like /connect -SSL host port gives me a few warnings, like could not verify, and md5 then it goes "Connection lost to host" which is problematic since I'd like to use irssi to have it so I can stay on the host at all times.  Is there a way to turn off verificati

01:19 +billnye: Jfrost: I think the right solution is to make your cert verify.
01:20 +Jfrost: billnye: it's not my cert, the ca authority doesn't exist, I have a copy of the cert I keep locally as long as it matches up I assume it's good, which is what I do for xchat, but don't have a TUI for it.  Plus irssi works really well most days, this issue just is problematic, also I'd prefer not to have to pay for it or add a root certificate to my chain
01:21 +billnye: why not the latter?
01:23 +Jfrost: why do I want to add an unsigned untrusted certificate to authenticate servers, since I don't know who they'll give it to, how secure it is and or whether or not they feel like poisoning things
01:23 +Jfrost: and it's not my server so i'm not planning on paying for it for them to fix it
01:24 +billnye: ah, a THEMself-signed cert

11:26 +leleobhz: because my certificate have password
11:26 +leleobhz: the weird is i can change between channels without problem
11:26 +leleobhz: problem is just when i type
11:27 +jink: Ah, so the ask-pass or whatever, broke your terminal.
11:27 +leleobhz: yes
11:27 +jink: Get rid of the password? :)
11:27 +jink: It's 600 anyway, so no one else but you should have access to it.
11:30 +leleobhz: jink: its my main certificate
11:30 +leleobhz: ill not remove their password
11:30 +jink: Then don't.  Suit yourself. :)
11:31 +leleobhz: wait, the solution for this is remove my cert passwd?
11:31 +leleobhz: ¬¬
11:31 +webvictim: the easy solution

15:22 +trifler: interact with irssi*
15:23 +deryni: What do you want the script to do exactly? Automatically fetch the image at the url?
15:23 +vague`: trifler, learn.perl.org, look for Beginning perl
15:24 +trifler: deryni: parse the text in the channel (regexp looking for .jpg, .png w/e ending) and if it's a picture wget the picture to a pre-defined folder.
15:26 +deryni: So I can to link /dev/urandom into my public space as awesome_picture.png and fill up your disk?
15:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
15:28 +trifler: deryni: Well in theory you can fill my disk, but you have to supply allot of http://....png/jpg urls inorder to do that, and be in the allowed channel that the script would listen in.
15:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
15:30 +deryni: I'd only need one, it'd just keep sending data.
15:30 +deryni: But I'd still say look at the existing scripts, modifying one of them is likely going to be your easiest solution.
