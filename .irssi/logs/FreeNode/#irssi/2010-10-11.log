10:02 +marekw2143: ho, how to show list of open tabs? (writing from irssi :))
10:02 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v willwh]
10:03 +Rhonda: /window list
10:04 +marekw2143: Rhonda: so it shows only on "main window"?
10:04 +Rhonda: I'm not completely sure what you would expect or want or mean. :)
10:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
10:05 +marekw2143: see list of actually opened window after enterng one command :)
10:05 +marekw2143: I guess it's available by writing own script, but would like to use built feature
10:05 +Rhonda: That's what /window list does.
10:06 +Ticho: Rhonda: you blew his mind
10:06 +marekw2143: Rhonda: but after entering /window list in "this" (#irssi) channel, nothing shows
10:06 +Rhonda: Ticho: It's monday morning, that's easy.
10:07 +Ticho: marekw2143: check your status window
10:07 +Rhonda: marekw2143: Because the output is put into the status window because it has nothing to do with the current channel.
10:07 +marekw2143: ok, thanks all!
10:08 +Rhonda: Why all? Because the others were sitting there and didn't disagree or make a noise? :)
10:09 +Ticho: people do not value the art of staying quiet enough :>
10:10 +zmx: I thinks it's a good reason
10:11 +marekw2143: by context I meant you Rhonda and Ticho :)

12:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Weust`]
12:32 +shabble: yep
12:33 +Bazerka: can you check something for me? /set autolog_path <some_partial_dir_that_exists><tabcomplete> and see if it puts a space at the end? (don't need to actually execute the command, just want to see if a space gets put into the input area)
12:34 +shabble: what do you mean by partial dir? ~/foo ok?
12:35 +Ticho: if ~/foo exists and is a directory
12:36 +shabble: oh, partial in the sense of '~/fo<tab>'
12:36 +shabble: no, it doesn't add a trailing space
12:36 +Bazerka: thanks

12:47 +Bazerka: that's not to suggest there isn't a bug, I just couldn't reproduce it
12:48 +shabble: sure
12:48 +shabble: there are 2 people who can reproduce it (I can't) consistently
12:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
12:48 +shabble: is there anything useful I could get from them to add to the report?
12:49 +Bazerka: I don't think there's much I can do without being able to reproduce it (so that I can gdb debug it)

12:50 +neo10101: hi!
12:51 +mingdao: Bazerka: fwiw /set autolog_path <some_partial_dir_that_exists><tabcomplete> does not put a space at the end here, either ...  Irssi v0.8.14
12:52 +shabble: Bazerka: http://metavore.org/faff/irssi.ogv is a screencast of it happening
12:54 +Bazerka: shabble: interesting
12:54 +Bazerka: what terminal is that?
12:54 +neo10101: hi! Bazeka
12:54 +neo10101: sorry Bazerka
12:54 +Bazerka: mingdao: thanks
12:55 +shabble: Bazerka: gnome-term, I believe.
12:55 +Bazerka: I didn't expect it to happen, but someone claims it is and I don't have 0.8.14/linux to check
12:55 +Bazerka: I suspect a case of fat fingers :)
12:55 +Bazerka: shabble: ugh
12:56 +Bazerka: are both cases using gnome-term?
12:56 +shabble: let me check the logs
12:56 * Bazerka really doesn't want to have to install gnome
12:56 +Bazerka: or any of its deps
12:56 +mingdao: shabble: is that your desktop? looks nice to me
12:57 +shabble: mingdao: nope, it's from estragib
12:58 +shabble: Bazerka: urxvt as well
13:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
13:05 +vague`: Bazerka, that's why you have vmware
13:05 +vague`: -or- vbox
13:05 +ds187: Bazerka: is irssi perhaps using bash_completion in the background? there could be the problem of the trailing space. you can configure that there somewhere, and for example some "older" Ubuntu releases, such as dapper had this "feature"
13:05 +Bazerka: vague`: I already have more than enough vm instances
13:07 +Bazerka: it was far easier to ask someone in here who already has 0.8.14/linux than to spend time building it to test for a one off
13:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v uLinux]
13:07 +uLinux: hello
13:07 +Bazerka: ds187: irssi doesn't use anything from the shell
13:07 +Bazerka: at least, that I'm aware of
13:08 +ds187: oh, ok....'t was just a guess :-)
13:08 +ds187: because the problem seemd familiar to me :-)
13:08 +Bazerka: besides, the description of the issue involved doesn't ring quite true to me
13:09 +Bazerka: as a completely path would never be the last component of an autolog path (that would be a target or stfrformat)
13:09 +Bazerka: *completed
13:09 +uLinux: what is command to part and join a channel?
13:09 +Bazerka:  /cycle
13:09 +uLinux: ty Bazerka
13:10 +Bazerka: ds187: or some arbitary string even, never a completed path tho
13:10 +Bazerka: at least, not without editing part of the string after tab completing
13:11 +ds187: Bazerka: or perhaps readline? :-) just found an issue concerning trailing spaces and special versins of readline :-)
13:11 +Bazerka: we don't use readline either
13:11 +ds187: .oO( they seem to use not that much.... )

13:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ahpla]
13:16 +shabble: no, that was before we stripped it down to a minimal case
13:16 +shabble: I've just got an ubuntu vm running, and I can repro with the testcase there
13:18 +uLinux: Bazerka: is it possible to bind alt or ctrl to + and -?
13:19 +uLinux: sy hilight
13:19 +uLinux: sry
13:19 +Bazerka: shabble: ah, just reproduced it
13:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghostDancer]
13:19 +Bazerka: by manually resizing the window, rather than the screen scriplet
13:19 +uLinux: i ment bind ctrl++
13:20 +Bazerka: ctrl + isn't a valid keycombo, is it?
13:20 +uLinux: or alt + up/down
13:21 +uLinux: so i can use it in nicklist
13:21 +uLinux: to scroll up and down
13:21 +shabble: meta-+ works, haven't tried -
13:21 +shabble: ctrl +/- isn't possible, afaik
13:21 +uLinux: meta is alt right
13:21 +shabble: yeah, usually
13:22 +Steve57: this has probably been asked a million times, but how about binding function keys?
13:23 +shabble: Steve57: http://wouter.coekaerts.be/site/irssi/keybindings
13:23 +Steve57: shabble, thanks
13:23 +uLinux: shabble: meta + up?
13:24 +uLinux: ./bind meta-up command ?
13:25 +shabble: uLinux: should work, I think it's bound ot 'key mup' by default, so you can '/bind mup /command something'
13:25 +uLinux: oh i see
13:25 +uLinux: mup                  upper_window
13:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v uzsolt]
13:25 +uLinux: it's already binded
13:27 +shabble: you can rebind it if you don't use the existing command for anything
13:28 +uLinux: i dont even get "upper_window"
13:28 +neo10101: hi! friends
13:28 +uLinux: is it to change windows
13:28 +uLinux: neo10101: hello
13:31 +shabble: uLinux: it's when you have split windows, to switch between them.
13:31 +shabble: Bazerka: hmm, running with malloc_check_ gives a different backtrace: http://metavore.org/faff/irssi-bt.txt
13:32 +uLinux: shabble: if i split windows using nicklist.pl causes problems?
13:32 +shabble: I don't know, I've never really used nicklist
13:32 +shabble: I shouldn't think so, but I could be wrong
13:32 +uLinux: wait

13:44 +derdon: hello
13:46 +derdon: I want to modify the status bar so that I don't see the numbers for the channels after the string "Act" like "[Act: 2,5,8]", but its corresponding channel names, e.g. ["Act: #foo,#bar,#spam"]
13:46 +cyraxx: there's a script for that, called actbar
13:47 +cyraxx: err, chanact actually
13:47 +Steve57: derdon: or /set actlist_names on
13:48 +derdon: Steve57: thanks, it helped!
13:48 +Steve57: welcome :)
13:49 +derdon: and how can I say that I want the channel names to *always* appear on the statub bar and to change only the color if anything happened in these channels?
13:50 +shabble: I think chanact.pl can do that, adv_windowlist certainly can
13:51 +derdon: alright, thanks

16:27 +mingdao: did you ever try multi-aterm
16:27 +mingdao: I have source for it but never got around to building it
16:27 +tmr: There was something, can't remember anymore. Perl extensions were nice though.
16:28 +tmr: mingdao, I don't really see why terminals should have tabs or anything like that, I have tmux and WM that does already same thing.
16:30 +mingdao: tmr: tabs are convenient to navigate when you need many terms
16:31 +tmr: mingdao, conveniently confusing when you have to use another terminal, screen/tmux will always work same way no matter what terminal you're using.
16:32 +mingdao: I don't follow you there.
16:33 +billnye: taking the feature from the terminal program to the terminal itself means that the feature remains even when the terminal program has to be substituted for any reason
16:33 +mingdao: my only terminal emulator is urxvt, and moving through tabs is shift -> or shift <- ... I don't HAVE to use another terminal ... but maybe you could enlighten me

16:36 +mingdao: I don't even like Skype and QQ on the iPhone screen ... I could only imagine anything like that on a Nokia postage stamp size screen.
16:36 +mingdao: tmr: sorry, I'm too new to follow you
16:36 +tmr: mingdao, point is that I have to use different terminals.
16:37 +mingdao: I've run Linux sitting here on the backside of the world by myself for 7 years, and have very limited knowledge outside working with the kernel.

16:41 +juk_: I was wondering how would I change my hostname
16:42 --- Nebulae_ is now known as Nebulae
16:42 +billnye: juk_: many networks offer hostname cloaking to hide it, but to CHANGE it typically requires the cooperation of your ISP
16:42 +tmr: juk_, /set hostname or /help network, but naturally that must be reversable to your machine.
16:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ahpla]
16:43 +juk_: billnye: I dont need cloaking, for what --hostname flag
16:43 +billnye: juk_: that's for specifying which outgoing interface to use, in case of a multi-homed machine
16:44 +juk_: billnye: but it's irrelevant for irssi when it shows me joining leaving right?
16:45 +billnye: juk_: not entirely irrelevant, just irrelevant for most people's ISP situation
16:45 +billnye: it's not the right answer for the vast majority of people with your question

16:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v DigitallyBorn]

17:09 +uLinux: haha billnye just typed
17:09 +uLinux: ./alias billnye I know :P
17:09 +uLinux: ;D
17:09 +Babar: /say!
17:10 +billnye: hehe uLinux
17:10 +mingdao: what does /alias find lastlog   actually do?
17:10 +grawity: mingdao: Makes "/find" an alias to "/lastlog"
17:10 * grawity just types /last
17:10 +billnye: /ll
17:10 +grawity: Hmm
17:10 +uLinux: grawity: is the same of /lastlog?
17:10 +Babar: logs are for sissies anyway
17:11 +uLinux: Babar: i dont use logs
17:11 +billnye: uLinux: unless you have or create a command that's a better match for "last" than "lastlog" is currently
17:11 +mingdao: logs are my Google fu

17:12 +uLinux: billnye: ok didnt get it
17:12 +uLinux: billnye: i want to /find text
17:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FusionX]
17:12 +uLinux: so i used /lastlog
17:12 +juk: billnye: mingdao: ok, my brain hurts I dont knows how get that whois thing Ill go sleep
17:13 +uLinux: last or lastlog is the same!
17:13 +juk: billnye: mingdao: thanks for sharing thoughts
17:13 * mingdao passes juk a cup of Hani Coffee ;)
17:13 +mingdao: juk: don't leave ... they'll tell you easy
17:13 * uLinux /last vs /lastlog
17:13 +juk: mingdao: tell what?
17:14 +mingdao: where your status window is located
17:14 +mingdao: to be honest I never used irssi except from urxvt ssh'ed into my server in screen
17:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ampzqlox]
17:14 +tmr: /window goto (status)
17:15 +juk: mingdao: I afraid i won't interpret thing right
17:15 +mingdao: juk: just put what tmr posted in this window
17:15 +mingdao:  /window goto (status)    <-  just that with no space in front of it
17:16 +tmr: "/alias w window goto " ftw.
17:17 +uLinux: irssi is great
17:17 +vert2: it is indeed
17:17 +mingdao: juk: 你输入 /window goto (status)
17:17 +mingdao: oops ... me go sleep too
17:18 +uLinux: is it possible to bind a terminal command to an alias?
17:18 +uLinux: just launch something
17:18 +tmr: Depends, try /help exec
17:18 +uLinux: :)

17:21 +vert2: will irssi ever have a nicklist option like weechat?
17:21 +vert2: nicklist.pl just doesn't do it for me :(
17:21 +imMute: vert2: probably not. why doesnt nicklist work for you?
17:21 --- lindbohm.freenode.net sets modes [#irssi +v FusionX]
17:22 +vert2: imMute: it works, but it cuts off long sentences
17:22 +vert2: imMute: maybe i've configured it incorrectly
17:23 +imMute: thats possible, I havn't used nicklist in a long time, I dont remmeber any problems with it though
17:26 +vert2: okay thanks

21:19 +macmaN: greets allz
21:20 +vert2: hello
21:21 +macmaN: does somebody know how is it possible to "/hilight acl" but at the same time not have it match a nickname like "mooacl_"
21:22 +macmaN: i cant do -full i think, since i want to match acls, acl-s etc
21:22 +Bazerka: use the -full option to make it only match a word
21:22 +Bazerka: heh, have to be awkward!
21:23 +macmaN: im guessing some nifty regexp would work though, right
21:23 +Dirm: macmaN: trigger.pl has an example for preventing some things from hilighting you
21:24 +macmaN: mkay lemme take a look

21:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
21:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v andares]
21:36 +billnye: macmaN: acl-s would still match
21:36 +billnye: macmaN: but not acls
21:38 +macmaN: match for... simply /hilight acl?
21:39 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v uLinux]
21:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip]
21:46 +billnye: macmaN: match for -full
21:46 +billnye: - is a non-word char
21:46 +billnye: IIRC anyway
21:47 +macmaN: yeah figured that too, but is -regexp basically the the answer here
21:47 +billnye: if your needs are more complicated than taking the above into account, yes
21:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fisted]
21:52 +macmaN: another thing.. tmux style window splitting.. ANY chance for this some time this century?
21:52 +macmaN: missing vertically splittable windows bigtime
21:52 +znx: macmaN: use tmux ?
21:53 +Bazerka: macmaN: if you want to use weechat, just use weechat ;)
21:53 +macmaN: znx: i am, but how does that help splitting irssi vertically
21:54 +macmaN: i don't, otherwise i wouldnt be asking
21:54 +macmaN: :)
21:54 +macmaN: but i guess i got the answer
21:55 +macmaN: either patch it myself or just maybe my grandkids will be able to vertsplit in irssi
21:55 +Bazerka: vertsplit create as many problems as they solve
21:57 +macmaN: i am not sure whether i would have a single problem with having 6 windows on the screen instead of 3 half-empty ones
21:57 +macmaN: judging from irssi and vim... vertsplit is quite useful
21:58 +macmaN: *tmux.. lol
21:58 +znx: macmaN: OH sorry i didnt think .. irssi heh
21:58 +Bazerka: note that I didn't say they wouldn't be useful
21:59 +macmaN: isnt useful = benefits > problems?
21:59 +Bazerka: something can be full of problems, yet still be useful
21:59 +Bazerka: c.f. Windows.
21:59 +Bazerka: :)
21:59 +macmaN: hahha
22:00 +macmaN: yeah thats an argument not arguable
