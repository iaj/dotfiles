19:59 +WOFall: hi ;p so what's the proper way to do this?   Irssi::active_win()->{active}->command("server purge");
19:59 +vague`: The proper way?
20:00 +WOFall: well, is it necessary to put all those steps in?
20:00 +vague`: Irssi::active_server()->command("server purge"); ?
20:00 +Dirm: probably Irssi::active_server()->command
20:00 +Dirm: oops too slow
20:01 +vague`: :)
20:01 +WOFall: it's only curiosity really, i don't care if it's not perfect for me
20:02 +WOFall: thanks >.< i sort of knew that already, but i'm not even sure what i'm really asking
20:04 +WOFall: actually that is helpful, thanks guys

21:09 +ryanakca: I'm trying to get irssi to display unicode on OpenBSD. My terminal properly displays accents (ex: é (e-acute)), but in irssi they don't display properly. Any suggestions?
21:10 +Koffa: é
21:10 +grawity: ryanakca: Are you talking about messages from other users?
21:10 +grawity: ryanakca: Also, /set term_charset UTF-8
21:11 +ryanakca: grawity: I think that fixed it, I can enter àôéùàôéùàô ... I still can't see what Koffa entered, but it's better than nothing.
21:11 +grawity: I think what Koffa entered was a question mark.
21:11 +Koffa: recode on?
21:12 +ryanakca: grawity: It was sending and receiving
21:12 +Koffa: I entered e-acute
21:12 +Koffa: latin-1
21:12 +grawity: And it's well-known that latin-1 sucks.

23:36 +Newb`s: hello
23:36 +Newb`s: It seems that the bug we discovered last day with the utf-8 char only affects irssi
23:37 +Newb`s: How can I do a bug report about that ?
23:38 +JonatanDK: What bug?
23:39 +Remco: Also: http://bugs.irssi.org/
23:39 +JonatanDK: Was about to link to that :P
23:40 +Newb`s: thanks
23:41 +Newb`s: Remco: the bug with this char :
23:41 +Newb`s: l⃦⃘⃯⃔⃤⃞⃟
23:41 +Newb`s: you see ?
23:41 +Remco: A boat or something?
23:41 +Remco: Want a screenshot?
23:41 +Newb`s: A boat ? I've a poor english, sorry.
23:42 +Newb`s: I have some screenshots already, but if you want give me another one
23:42 +JonatanDK: Ok, that definieatly screwes somethign up
23:42 +Newb`s: thanks
23:43 +Newb`s: I tried to strace/see if one thing is getting bad but I didn't see something strange
23:43 +Remco: Newb`s: http://download.remcol.ath.cx/screenshot-irssi-unicodechar.png
23:43 +JonatanDK: Looks worse with me
23:43 +Newb`s: thakns Remco
23:43 +Newb`s: ew
23:43 +Newb`s: with me too
23:43 +Newb`s: wait, I screen
23:46 +Newb`s: hydraze.org/irssi-bug.png
23:46 +Remco: Copy/paste into another terminal doesn't make it better here either
23:46 +Remco: Oh, that's bad
23:47 +Newb`s: And I've the same issue in urxvt/xterm/gnome-terminal
23:47 +Remco: It looks like it's being sent wrong
23:47 +Newb`s: people have this bug on ubuntu/arch and with differents versions of irssi
23:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
23:48 +Remco: What character is this?
23:48 +JonatanDK: Newb`s: http://www.myupload.dk/showfile/6523034319f.jpg/
23:48 +JonatanDK: Mine
23:48 +Newb`s: I don't really know, someone was playing with the utf-8 tables on one chan and I saw that
23:49 +Newb`s: zsh tell me it's : <20ef><20e6><20d8><20d4><20e4><20de><20df>
23:49 +Newb`s: thanks JonatanDK
23:49 +Newb`s: and you both have irssi 0.8.15
23:50 +Newb`s: that's really strange
23:50 +Newb`s: -l
23:50 +Remco: It looks more like it's multiple characters superimposed over eachother
23:55 +Newb`s: Do you think I have enough info to bug report it?
23:55 +Remco: I saved the rawlog and opened it in wordpad in my winxp VM
23:55 +Remco: It shows as a string of characters there
23:56 +Death4Li1e: use another editor :)
23:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v n-iCe]
23:58 +n-iCe: hi, where can I read how to reconfigure my /ban command to set it to *!*@host
23:58 +JonatanDK:  /set ban_type
23:58 +Remco: All the browsers I have on there agree with wordpad
23:59 +Newb`s: Remco: but why those chars rewrite the screen like that :
23:59 +Newb`s: http://www.myupload.dk/showfile/6523034319f.jpg/
23:59 +Remco: Negative margin on the characters? No clue really
