11:42 +Rhonda: yawniek: Could be scripted.
11:45 +yawniek: Rhonda: like polling?
11:45 +Rhonda: timer that checks a file or something
11:45 +yawniek: kk, so theres no default mechanism for that. thanks
11:45 +Rhonda: Take a look at the cron script.

11:45 +Rhonda: Haven't used it myself, but that uses timer facilities, potential giving you hints on it.

12:53 +Maxdamantus: irssi automatically accepts DCC chats by default?
12:54 +Maxdamantus: How do I stop it autoaccepting DCC chats?
12:55 +Maxdamantus: Hm. There were like 400 DCC chats to me on Mozilla's network O_o
12:57 +Maxdamantus: 489
12:59 +webvictim: it doesn't automatically accept them.
12:59 +webvictim: you have to type /dcc chat nick to actually make the connection
12:59 +webvictim: also look at /set dcc_autochat_masks

13:01 +webvictim: yeah, that's just the request
13:01 +webvictim: it gives you the chance to accept, and if you don't do it in time, it says "DCC lost chat to nick"

13:15 +antgel: hi all.  long-time irssi user here but probably don't drive it that well.  my channel list and hence window list is growing.  whenever i connect, my channels finish up in different numbers.  is there a way to fix them?  or to get quickly to a channel without /win $some_num?
13:17 +webvictim: you can put them in the right order and do /layout save
13:18 +webvictim: as long as your networks and channels are set up properly within irssi, it'll always put them in the same place
13:18 +webvictim: you can also use /window goto #irssi
13:18 +webvictim: or whatever
13:18 +webvictim: i did /alias w window goto
13:18 +webvictim: so i can do /w #irssi
13:18 +webvictim: :)
13:18 +webvictim: (which i can tab-complete)
13:22 +Bazerka: that's not strictly true ;)
13:23 +webvictim: well, yeah, 9/10 times though :P
13:23 +Bazerka: there's a bug where if you reconnect twice after a layout save, any further reconnects will cause your channels to forget their windows
13:23 +Bazerka: which is fixed in trunk

15:13  Gryllida: hm, /connect irc.freenode.net gryllida:password -- is this sasl? (it appears to make me identify onconnect)
15:14 +grawity: Gryllida: No, it's plain old password authentication
15:14  Gryllida: does it msg to nickserv in this case?
15:15 +grawity: From the client side, it uses the "PASS" command as defined in RFC 1459
15:15 +grawity: But yes, it's translated to a PRIVMSG to NickServ by the server.
15:15  Gryllida:  Error in script cap_sasl:

15:15  Gryllida: ^ this means I installed something wrong?
15:15 +grawity: You're missing Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum
15:16  Gryllida: something I need root to add?
15:16 +grawity: On Debian, likely to be libcrypt-openssl-bignum-perl on repos
15:16  Gryllida: ok
15:16 +grawity: Or you can install it from CPAN, which doesn't require root
15:16  Gryllida: wouldn't it be for me only in this case?
15:17 +grawity: It would, that's kind of how rootless installations always work
15:18 +grawity: You'll also need Math::BigInt::GMP, Crypt::DH and Crypt::Blowfish
15:18 +DeathWolf: mmm
15:18 +DeathWolf: how does one flush all buffers to disk?
15:18 +grawity: DeathWolf: "sync"
15:19 +DeathWolf: /sync ?
15:19 +grawity: Gryllida: All those are for the DH-BLOWFISH mechanism of SASL. If you are using SSL-encrypted connections, SASL PLAIN will be enough.
15:19 +grawity: DeathWolf: oh, in irssi? :\
15:19 +DeathWolf: yes:)
15:19 +grawity: depends on what you mean by 'buffer' - the scrollback, or the filesystem?
15:20 +DeathWolf: scrollback
15:20 +DeathWolf: I was searching my logs and noticed they were missing the last 12 hours or so
15:20 +grawity: Are your logs on?
15:20 +DeathWolf: yes
15:20  Gryllida: grawity: well plain text would do, but I can not load the script
15:21  Gryllida: libcrypt-openssl-bignum-perl seems to be already installed
15:21 +grawity: DeathWolf: irssi doesn't actually buffer logfile writes, if that's what you mean...
15:21 +grawity: Gryllida: What does it say now?
15:22 +DeathWolf: well all I know is that my logs do work fine, they just seem to be slightly out of date
15:23 +grawity: Gryllida: like I said, there are a few more modules you need.
15:23  Gryllida: grawity: this is what I pasted, that package is available, it says Can't locate Crypt/OpenSSL/Bignum.pm in @INC
15:23 +DeathWolf: mmm, I wonder what's the behaviour of the default write_buffer_timeout set to 0
15:24 +grawity: Gryllida: find out where it is installed, with dpkg -L <name>
15:24 +grawity: Gryllida: then check where irssi is looking for it, with /script exec print for @INC
15:25 +DeathWolf: alternatively, is there any way to search all open windows at once for a recent enough highlight?
15:26 +DeathWolf: s/highlight/re match/
15:27 * DeathWolf needs to find who it was he was getting highlighted by, but didn't pay attention to where:(

15:30 +DeathWolf: oh, normal time stuff
15:30 * DeathWolf sets to 1min and patiently waits
15:33 +DeathWolf: meh, this log business is mysterious
15:35 +grawity: Gryllida: If re-installation did not help, run 'cpan' (or perl -MCPAN -eshell). You will need it for one of the modules anyway.

15:41  Gryllida: well I would buy a vps if I had a bank account maybe

15:58 +blueyed: Shouldn't irssi redraw the screen on terminal width changes? "/redraw" does not work (does nothing), and when Ctrl-Z'ing from irssi, COLUMNS is fixed at 101 (startup value?!).
16:00 +grawity: blueyed: $COLUMNS in bash is only updated when bash itself, not any of its children, receives SIGWINCH
16:01 +grawity: blueyed: 'shopt -s checkwinsize' to make it update every time prompt is displayed
16:01 +grawity: blueyed: as for irssi, it too relies on SIGWINCH to detect size changes.
16:02 +grawity: blueyed: it also might depend on your terminal program and any layers between it and irssi (such as screen, tmux, ssh, ...)
16:03 +blueyed: irssi is running as a user "su - user". user has shell bash, root zsh. I am running in screen. When simulating it in another screen window, it gets updated.
16:03 +blueyed: "shopt -s checkwinsize" was on already.
16:03 +grawity: blueyed: what happens if you pkill -SIGWINCH irssi?
16:04 +blueyed: grawity: nothing
16:04 +grawity: blueyed: what if you do it to the particular PID?
16:05 +grawity: I wonder if it could be that the terminal emulator is not allowed to signal 'screen', or that 'screen' cannot do so to irssi
16:05 +blueyed: grawity: still nothing. there's only a single instance anyway. I've also tried "Ctrl-Z, export COLUMNS=154", but when Ctrl-Z
16:06 +blueyed: 'ing again, it's at 101 again.
16:06 +grawity: because, like I said, with 'checkwinsize' bash updates it to the actual width every time.
16:06 +blueyed: I see. It works in another screen window - so it looks like it's related to irssi only.
16:07 +grawity: Another window in the same session?
