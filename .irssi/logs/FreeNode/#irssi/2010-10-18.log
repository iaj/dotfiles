02:29 +Dirm: er
02:29 +Dirm: do you mean a command that is sent when you join a channel
02:29 +Dirm: or that you have an autosendcmd and you want it to be delayed until after you join?

05:44 +iarp: shabble: i tried that but then it sent the away message everytime i sent them a message
05:45 +shabble: that's exactly what it's not meant to do
05:45 +shabble: unless you have something really wonky going on

07:09 +JackStoner: my connection has blocked irssi from connecting, is there a way to use proxy around it??
07:12 +vague`: JackStoner, in english please, or atleast, english common, not 'my mind's english'
07:12 +JackStoner: vague`: sorry???
07:13 +JackStoner: vague`: i want to use a proxy with irssi, how do i do that??
07:13 +vague`: What does 'my connection has blocked irssi from conecting' mean?
07:14 +JackStoner: vague`: i cant connect to any irc with irssi or any irc client except web-based one.
07:14 +vague`: From work I assume?
07:14 +JackStoner: school actually
07:15 +vague`: Well, no help from me, sorry. You are trying to circumvent a policy and I wont help you break it.
07:15 +JackStoner: vague`: wow...thanks for the help
07:16 +JackStoner: vague`: PS: its not a policy, i spoke to one of the admins and they claim to not have blocked irc
07:16 +vague`: jayne, so ask them to investigate.
07:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
07:18 +vague`: sorry jayne :)
07:18 +JackStoner: vague`: for anonymity use how do i use a proxy?
07:19 +jayne: if you're on Windows and running McAfee, you probably need to either configure McAfee to not block the port, or use an alternate port, like one of 6665, 6666, 6667, 7000 (SSL), 7070 (SSL), 8000, 8001, and 8002
07:19 +JackStoner: jayne: im runnin *nix
07:19 +jayne: that's not it, then. So your admins probably need to figure out why the network isn't doing what they think it should.
07:20 +JackStoner: its a bit hard geting hold of them...something about being "busy" :P

09:35 +morpheuspr: well i cant figure out the hilight and nicklist.pl
09:35 +morpheuspr: TC``: i want nicks on right and the hilight window doesnt really work
09:35 +TC``: for hilight, see /help hilight
09:35 +TC``: oh, ok
09:36 +TC``: for nicklist, just load the script with /script load nicklist
09:36 +TC``: then /nicklist screen
09:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jaminja]
09:36 +TC``: (you have to run irssi in screen for this to work)
09:37 +TC``: for the hilight win script, I never really manage to know how this script works, sorry
09:37 +morpheuspr: what do u mean in screen im pretty new to irssi
09:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mavrc]
09:38 +TC``: screen is another program
09:38 +TC``: which emulates a terminal
09:38 +morpheuspr: TC``: in hilight it does say create window name hilight.  i do that but all i get is split screen window
09:39 +TC``: morpheuspr, and if you go through your windows with ctrl+p or ctrl+n, do you come to that splitted window?
09:40 +TC``: http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi <- if you want to learn how to use screen, this one is quite good
09:40 +morpheuspr: TC``: yup
09:40 +TC``: and nothing is displayed on it?
09:41 +morpheuspr: TC``: nope
09:41 +morpheuspr: TC``: whats the command to create a window and call it hilight?

09:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v preller_]

09:54 +TC``: no
09:54 +TC``: I said if you want it on the right of irssi, you have to use irssi within screen

19:31 +Nebulae: Like.. switch, I guess
19:31 +Bazerka: they all use the same window
19:31 +Nebulae: I know, but sometimes It'll be set in freenode

19:32 +Nebulae: Erm.. /command*
19:32 +Death4Li1e: Nebulae: ^X

20:20 +Barlow:  /channel
20:21 +PythonNub: No... that lists everyone ON the channel
20:21 +Dirm: well it also lists all of the channels
20:21 +Dirm: /window list might suit your purposes
20:21 +PythonNub: I want to list all the channels I'm currently /join'd into
20:21 +PythonNub: nope.
20:21 +PythonNub: that only infos this channel
20:21 +PythonNub: :\
20:21 +Yvemath: PythonNub: /window list, does the job
20:21 +Dirm: are you sure you're in more than one channel?
20:21 +Dirm: both /channel and /window list show all of my channels
20:22 +PythonNub: aaah
20:22 +PythonNub: thank you
20:22 +PythonNub: yeah /channel shows it
20:22 +PythonNub: but it has to list everyone on those chanels
20:22 +PythonNub: :\
20:22 +PythonNub: thanks!
20:23 +tmr: listchans alias is handy.

20:24 +rolle_: Alt-keys don't work. Except alt-1. What's the matter?
20:24 +rolle_: I'm on windows with putty.
20:25 +shabble: rolle_: does esc-<num> w ork?
20:25 +billnye: rolle_: you can /win 2 and then alt+1, but not alt+2 ?
20:25 +rolle_: billnye, Yes
20:26 +rolle_: shabble, Yes.
20:26 +rolle_: Alt+arrow also works fine.
20:26 +rolle_: And I haven't changed any settings recently as far as I know.
20:26 +shabble: maybe something rebound them accidentally?
20:27 +rolle_: I checked /bind, everything seems ok.
20:27 +shabble: try /bind meta-2 ?
20:27 +shabble: actually, if esc num works, the bindings are fine
20:27 +shabble: hmm
20:27 +rolle_: It's change_window 2
20:27 +rolle_: Like it should.
20:27 +rolle_: Right?
20:27 +shabble: probably some stupid thing where it's trying to use alt as some sor tof compose special characters thing, rather than as meta
20:27 +rolle_: What's esc's bind-alias or has it one
20:27 +shabble: check your putty settings?
20:28 +rolle_: Ok.
20:28 +shabble: esc is mea
20:28 +shabble: meta
20:28 +tmr: rolle_, bot esc, 1 and alt-1 should send same thing.
20:28 +tmr: s/bot/both/
20:30 +rolle_: It is not putty, I reset all the putty settings and no change
20:31 +billnye: if alt works properly on some keys, then it's usually some other app "stealing" the keypresses
20:31 +rolle_: Also putty keyboard settings and charset settings did not seem to affect in anything
20:31 +rolle_: Hmm
20:32 +rolle_: Oh yeah
20:32 +rolle_: billnye, It was Adobe Photoshop
20:32 +rolle_: Thanks for everything
20:33 +billnye: np
20:34 +tmr: Huh, Photoshop steals those while running on background? "Nice."

21:48 +H8train: billnye: yes it looks like the script calls "http://www.ludd.luth.se/irc/bin/csearch.cgi" wich no longer exists on that server. too bad someone doesn't have a backup of that cgi that I could put up on another host.
21:49 +shabble: what's it meant to do?
21:50 +nightfrog: Query the said site.
21:51 +nightfrog: shabble: long time no speak. How are you?
21:51 +H8train: chansearch searches /list of a server for your keyword.
21:51 +shabble: nightfrog: hey, not bad
21:52 +shabble: you finally found a decent source of internet? :)
21:52 +H8train: but chansearch calls that cgi to do the search I guess.
21:53 +nightfrog: Yeah, I'm using my neaighbors wireless right now since he has a 20/2 line which is faster than my 3/750
21:53 +shabble: nightfrog: my latest monstrosity: http://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/blob/master/vim-mode/vim_mode.pl
21:53 +shabble: with a lot of help from rudi_s
21:53 +nightfrog: H8train: Looks like that site still exists but no one adds anything to it
21:54 +shabble: there's 'searchirc' or something similar I think
21:54 +nightfrog: I saw him/her and uh someone else chatting about it and took a look and saw you in the file :-)
21:54 +shabble: dunno if they have an easily querable thing
21:55 +nightfrog: H8train: What script exactly are you typing about?
21:55 +H8train: shabble: think you could write something to query http://searchirc.com/ from user input and current server?
21:55 +H8train: nightfrog: chansearch
21:56 +shabble: H8train: tod o what?
21:56 +H8train: to search for irc channels from irssi
21:56 +H8train: it would take a month of sundays to manualy search through a/list on freenode :)
21:57 +shabble: hmm
21:57 +Dice-Man: the better is too whois people
21:57 +Dice-Man: and find some who are on many chan
21:57 +Dice-Man: lol
21:57 +billnye: H8train: there's always /msg alis help here on freenode
21:58 +H8train: Dice-Man: lol so thats the best method of searching for channels in irssi?
21:58 +Dice-Man: H8train, no i was joking
21:58 +Dice-Man: i hope there is another
21:58 +H8train: billnye: /msg alis?
21:58 +Dice-Man: more efficient
21:58 +nightfrog: H8train: That script is useless until that site actually gets some data to search through
21:59 +H8train: nightfrog: how bout http://irc.netsplit.de/channels/
21:59 +shabble: alis is probably the easiest way to go these days
21:59 +shabble: unless someone wants to write a screenscraper for one of those aggregator sites

21:59 +billnye: H8train: many networks (especially those with services) offer a channel-search alternative to "dumb" /list
22:00 +billnye: H8train: the one on FreeNode's services is a bot named alis
22:00 +H8train: oh ok so whats the syntax for searching with alis
22:01 +billnye: the aforementioned "/msg alis help" will tell you :D
22:01 +H8train: nvm
22:01 +nightfrog: /msg alis help
22:01 +billnye: (almost like I were psychic, huh? ;D )
22:01 +H8train: yea thanks billnye nightfrog
22:02 +billnye: np
22:07 +H8train: billnye: i keepgetting this

22:07 +H8train: no channel list
22:07 +H8train: do i just need to be more specific with my search terms?

22:53 +d3v0: are automatic query windows like nickserv msgs
22:53 +d3v0: because i cant close them and theyre annoying
22:53 +grawity: NickServ ones are notices.
22:54 +d3v0: hmmm
22:55 +grawity: d3v0: I sent you both; which ones you are talking about?
22:56 +d3v0: i have no idea
22:56 +d3v0: the site just says do this to turn off automatic query windows
22:56 +d3v0: i thought it was like when nickserv send you a message saying youve been identified
22:56 +grawity: And what are automatic query windows?
22:57 +d3v0: that was my question
22:57 +grawity: d3v0: Do you know what a irssi window is?
22:57 +d3v0: but yous aid theyre notices so i dunno
22:57 +grawity: d3v0: When you receive a private message, irssi opens a new window for it.
22:57 +grawity: If automatic_query_windows is on.
22:57 +d3v0: how do you close it?
22:57 +grawity: /window close
22:57 +grawity: Or /wc
22:58 +grawity: But I think you're DOING IT WRONG
22:58 +grawity: ...I mean
22:58 +grawity: Wait, I'm confused.
22:58 +d3v0: hrmm so if auto query windwos is off it will show me the message in the channel
22:58 +grawity: d3v0: No, the messages will go to the status window (since they don't _belong_ to a channel)
22:59 +grawity: d3v0: okay, now
22:59 +grawity: d3v0: 1) how are you identifying?
23:00 +grawity: d3v0: 2) which exact irssi setting are you talking about?
23:00 +d3v0: typing /msg nickserv
23:00 +d3v0: i figured it out it's all good
23:00 +d3v0: =)
23:00 +grawity: no, if you still use "/msg nickserv", you haven't
23:00 +d3v0: yeh im looking for that now
23:00 +d3v0: was setting up auto connect to servers
23:01 +d3v0: but i think when you autoconnect to server
23:01 +d3v0: it does all that
23:01 +grawity: If your irssi does a /msg when autoconnecting, you're still doing it wrong
23:02 +d3v0: but thats what it says on the site <_<
23:03 +d3v0: how do i do it right
23:03 +grawity: "Server password"
