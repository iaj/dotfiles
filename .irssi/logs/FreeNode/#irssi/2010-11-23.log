01:37 +Dirm: google irssi whois active window
01:38 +elik: Erm, in the faq.. sorry
01:38 +elik: I had been told it was a plugin, and couldn't find it in the scripts
01:40 +Dirm: yeah, it's a script, it's just not on irssi.org
01:40 +Bazerka: hack-whois-in-current-window
01:41 +lestat: elik: you can also disable the first window iirc
01:42 +lestat: don't remember its name
01:42 +elik: status
01:42 +Bazerka: although why anyone would want to do that is beyond me :)
01:42 +elik: Bazerka: if I want to ban a user, I want to be able to whois him to get his host name
01:43 +lestat: elik: i guess he meant about removing the status window ^^
01:43 +Bazerka: elik: I'm talking about making everything that would go to status go to your current window instead
01:43 +lestat: Bazerka: love that <3
01:43 +lestat: :P
01:44 +lestat: that + hilight window
01:44 +elik: Bazerka: your whois says you're a grumpy, old pendantic bastard :D
01:44 +elik: Bazerka: but yeah, I don't want everything in current window
01:44 +elik: so disabling status window is out of the question
01:44 +Bazerka: I don't mean to be pedantic, but it's spelt pedantic
01:44 +Bazerka: :P
01:45 +elik: cheap shot

04:08 +syntaxman: I've changed to urxvt as my xterm, and I can't mouse over and click urls like I could in xfce-terminal.
04:09 +deryni: urxvt can do that with one of its perl scripts, but there are also irssi scritps that can help with that (though not the mousing part I don't think).
04:09 +syntaxman: Don't see anything on the irssi website  (at least not yet)

05:19 +trybeingarun: i tried /ignore * JOINS
05:20 +trybeingarun: but it doesn't seem to work
05:21 +Bazerka:  /ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS
05:22 +Bazerka: it won't remove what's already in your buffers, but it will prevent new messages matching those levels from being displayed/logged
05:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v imMute]
05:22 +Bazerka: er, just displayed - they'll still get logged if you have those levels configured to log
05:22 +trybeingarun: but i am still getting joins and quits
05:23 +Bazerka: pastebin the output of /ignore
05:25 +trybeingarun: my bad. It is actually ignoring the message
05:25 +trybeingarun: How do i save the configuration?
05:25 +Bazerka:  /save
05:25 +trybeingarun: thanks Bazerka!
05:25 +Bazerka: you're welcome
05:26 +billnye: Bazerka: /ignore means ignore, unless you have a script loaded to handle the logging
05:27 +Bazerka: billnye: I'd already corrected myself, thanks :)
05:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v imMute]
05:27 +billnye: Bazerka: no, I'm correcting your correction
05:28 +Bazerka: huh?
05:28 +Bazerka: my correction states that /ignore doesn't affect logging
05:28 +billnye: ...and it does?
05:29 * Bazerka re-checks his log
05:29 +Bazerka: hohum
05:30 +Bazerka: it would help if I was looking for the correct ignore in my log

05:30 +billnye: you had your bases covered ;)
05:30 +Bazerka: heh
05:30 +Bazerka: for some reason I thought I had join/parts ignored in here, but I just have modes

05:59  charitwo: any way to make urls clickable ?
05:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v charitwo]
05:59 +deryni: That's up to your terminal emulator.
06:00 +charitwo: How do I find out / resolve this ?
06:00 +deryni: What terminal program are you using?
06:00 +imMute: charitwo: short answer.... "no".  long answer "go ask #your-terminal-emulator"
06:01 +charitwo: no idea
06:01 +imMute: what OS are you using?
06:01 +charitwo: this servers running gentoo
06:01 +deryni: And locally?
06:03 +charitwo: varies, i screen in from just about anywhere...but mostly ubuntu and win7
06:03 +syntaxman: charitwo: tmr /just/ gave me a couple URLs that helped with that.
06:03 +deryni: The component responsible for clickable links is the terminal you are using on the local machine.

06:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v cloq]
06:04 +deryni: syntaxman: We don't know what terminal he is using so a urxvt script may not help.
06:04 +syntaxman: deryni: oh.  I see.
06:04 +charitwo: in ubuntu i use the OS terminal, in win7 i use putty
06:05 +syntaxman: charitwo: meaning you're not using X, I assume.
06:05 +deryni: "the OS terminal" isn't a meaningful statement, your environment will have a default terminal though. On Ubuntu that is likely gnome-terminal though which should do clickable links I thought.
06:06 +billnye: on the windows side use puttytray or one of the other variants that supporst clickys
06:06 +billnye: supports*

06:36 +Datz: 23:23:28 records.host may not be NULL at /home/datz/.irssi/scripts/stalker.pl line 168.
06:37 +Datz: I don't know how that value would be null anyway.. I guess something won't be logged is all
06:40 +Bazerka: without adding additional debugging and waiting for it to happen again, it's going to be pretty hard to see what generated it
06:40 +Datz: ok
06:40 +Bazerka: add_record gets called from multiple places with different data
06:41 +Datz: well, as long as the script is still functioning, I don't much care

06:45 +Datz: I'd also be interested in knowing now difficult it is to set up stalker to work with mySQL
06:47 +Bazerka: a quick glance suggests it's quite trivial to modify it to use mysql
06:48 +Bazerka: just change the DBI->Connect block in stat_database to use the mysql driver (and add the additional arguments such as username, password, etc)
06:48 +Datz: trivial as in not necessary?
06:48 +Bazerka: trivial as in very easy
06:48 +Datz: ah
06:48 +Datz: :p
06:48 +Datz: ok, cool
06:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {{localhost}}]
06:49 +Datz: might have to try that out sometime. I wonder if it would be faster.. not that it's slow now.. humm :p
06:49 +Bazerka: may also need to add a line to set the db handle to use the correct database too
06:50 +Bazerka: I doubt very much that it'd be any quicker than sqlite
06:50 +Datz: yea
06:51 +Datz: is there a way I can look at the sqlite file in some human readable form?
06:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
06:54 +Bazerka: sqlite3 /path/to/nicks.db

21:46 +blueyed: Hi. I am new to irssi, and cannot see why highlighting does not work. I have color in general and setup /hilight - is there some way to test the color codes?
21:48 +shabble: what is your /hilight command, and what do you expect it to match?
21:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v blueyed]
21:53 +billnye: the troubleshooting trifecta of 1) what did you try, 2) what did you expect to happen, and 3) what did happen
21:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {Nathan}]
21:57 +Koffa: hmm.. I know I played with tab-in-empty-prompt-re-bind but I've lost it somewhere o,O
21:58 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v {{localhost}}]
21:58 +blueyed: billnye: if you refer to my hilight problem: AFAICS this should work by default, but I have added strings to "/hilight". But no highlighting happens.
21:58 +billnye: blueyed: you kinda said that already
21:58 +billnye: blueyed: and it doesn't address all of shabble's question nor my suggestion :)
22:01 +blueyed: Did not get the question from shabble nor your suggestion - due to restart?!
22:01 +billnye: my suggestion was the one you responded to
22:02 +billnye: and <+shabble> what is your /hilight command, and what do you expect it to match?
22:02 +vague`: billnye, use simple words.
22:02 +blueyed: and sorry, it works.. it just highlights the speaker, not anything else.
22:02 +billnye: even when they say blueyed?
22:03 +blueyed: Did not notice this is #test, but it's obvious now.
22:03 +blueyed: billnye: yes, but that's some config: blueyed is not highlighted but the nick in front (yours). Alright, that's fine for now.
22:05 +vague`: blueyed, see /help hilight
22:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v astra-x]
22:07 +billnye: blueyed: my point was is this line
22:07 +billnye: different from this one blueyed
22:07 +blueyed: vague`: my impression was that hilight_nick_matches (setting) should do it already.
22:08 +blueyed: billnye: no, highlighted the same: your nick is yellow, all the text gray/white.
22:09 +billnye: blueyed: hilight_nick_matches only applies to my first line, and it doesn't use the same settings as /hilight
22:09 +billnye: so turning it off is sensible for most people once you discover /hilight
22:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v astra-x]
22:10 +blueyed: ok, my hilighting happened through "/hilight blueyed", yes. removing this ("/dehilight") does not hilight anything anymore.
22:10 +billnye: once it's off and you've tested, you'll just need to phrase a proper question about how /help hilight doesn't match what you expect it to do
22:11 +blueyed: ok. Can I make /hilight to highlight the words itself, not the prefix/nick of the line?
22:12 +billnye: /help hilight
22:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
22:14 +blueyed: ok, I see. I was still under the impression that it would be a separate setting. Found it - thanks.
