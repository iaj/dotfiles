16:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Dice-Man]
16:35 +Nei: Koffa: maybe not, but what is your goal? you can have the status bar below the active window with a different color
16:40 +Koffa: Nei: not my goal but anyway... to make sure confidential stuff isn't accidentally said on a public channel/server
16:41 +Koffa: so eg. work-irc could have statusbar with red bg :)
16:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v grzesieq]
16:46 +Nei: mhm :)
16:47 +Nei: it would surely be possible with a script
16:47 +Koffa: (or vice-versa actually, but you get teh point)
16:47 +Nei: maybe just use 2 seperate irssi?
16:48 +Koffa: that's what I do but I can see the point in not doing so too

16:51 +ruoso: Hi.. I've been loocking in the manual but had no success... is there a command for getting a list of the windows open?
16:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v armenb]
16:51 +Nei: if you want to write a script, it just needs to execute the correct /statusbar command to show/hide the red bar on a defined list of channels
16:51 +Nei: did you try /window list ?
16:52 +ruoso: yes, it didn't produce any output
16:52 +armenb: in irssi, is there an easy way to have privmsgs get displayed to all channels?
16:52 +Nei: check your "status window" eg with Esc, 1
16:52 +armenb: right now all my privmsgs go to a separate window, and i don't notice i got messages until hours later when i switch to it.
16:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisBoy]
16:52 +ruoso: Nei: oh... thanks.. it was there indeed
16:53 +zmx: armenb: active channel instead of "all" channel is a good alternative ?
16:54 +armenb: zmx: well, yeah. or at least something that auto-splits my screen or blinks an character somewhere on the display telling me i have a message i haven't seen yet
16:55 +zmx: armenb: we have an activity bar with new window by default
16:55 +armenb: where is that?
16:55 +zmx: armenb: hilitewin (a script) is a nice solution for the split windows
16:55 +zmx: and at last you can adjust autocreate_query_level for not create query for new PRIV
16:56 +Nei: armenb: there are several things that might be of interest to you -- you can disable windows altogether, you can use a "watch" script that permanently shows messages in the top part of screen, you can pay more close attention to the "Act:" item in you status bar (privmsgs will be pink)
16:56 +armenb: heh, i'm kind of an idiot for not paying attention to the act bar :-P
16:57 +yitz_: And get the super duper ack script while you are at it!
16:57 +armenb: is there an easier way to close a privmsg window than "/window close", by the way?
16:58 +yitz_: /alias wc window close
16:58 +armenb: ack script?
16:58 +yitz_: /wc
16:58 +yitz_: http://github.com/rcaputo/irssi-ack/tree/yitz
16:58 +zmx: bind /window close to Alt+F4 :p
16:58 +yitz_: Eww
16:58 +Nei: you could even /toggle autocreate_split_windows for querys to "pop up"... might be annoying thou
16:58 +yitz_: Damn... I got a whole row of F keys I never ever ever use...
16:59 +yitz_: Nei: popups, eh? That sounds nifty
16:59 +Nei: popups are constrained to your irssi screen space :P
16:59 +Nei: there are scripts which could integrate with your systems prefered notification feature...

17:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v DigitallyBorn]
17:13 +Zed`: yitz_: when I am logged into irssi from my blackberry the new whitelist in ack is brilliant
17:13 +Nei: by default, white text on black background
17:14 +armenb: a-ha. is there a generic configuration setting that does the reverse?
17:14 +yitz_: Zed`: The whitelisting?
17:14 +armenb: rather, picks a color map that is friendlier to black-on-white terminals?
17:14 +armenb: right now highlighted nicks are yellow and they're hard to see unless I select the text with my mouse
17:15 +Nei: unfortunately not. a start would be http://anti.teamidiot.de/static/nei/*/Code/Irssi/default.theme
17:15 +Nei: doesnt help the yellow though
17:16 +armenb: nod.
17:16 +armenb: thanks for the hint though!
17:16 +Nei: search for %y in the theme
17:16 +Nei: eg in menick
17:16 +Zed`: yitz_: yeah, if I am on the berry I just want to flip between a couple chans, it works perfectly

22:13 +billnye: tips and tricks indeed
22:13 +Bazerka: tips and tricks
22:13 +billnye: one point baz, one deduction me :)
22:13 +endpoint_david: Bazerka: thanks, just reading that page now :-)

22:15 +endpoint_david: what does the "if you just wanna add them remove the "-auto"" distinction on that page mean?
22:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Lars_G]
22:19 +billnye: endpoint_david: you can configure channels without having irssi auto connect
22:19 +Lars_G: Can I edit config file with irss live, and have it reload in irssi without disconnecting?
22:20 +billnye: Lars_G: yes, but it's slightly dangerous and VERY unsupported, especially by us
22:20 +billnye: you could say slightly dangerous, quite undocumented, and very unsupported.
22:20 +Lars_G: Does that mean you wont tell me how?
22:20 +Lars_G: I promisse I wont ask how to fix stuff that comes out bad
22:21 +billnye: no, it means if you screw it up sorry bout your luck
22:21 +Lars_G: ok
22:21 +Death4Life: ( backup! )
22:21 +billnye: it's the editing by hand that's "risky" not loading a config
22:21 +Death4Life: you can also edit every setting in irssi itself...
22:21 +Lars_G: Oh I tend to edit the config by hand
22:22 +Lars_G: And I spinned it randomly and found /reload
22:22 +Lars_G: so I guess that's it
22:22 +billnye: yep
22:22 +Lars_G: there, it worked
22:22 +Lars_G: thanks
