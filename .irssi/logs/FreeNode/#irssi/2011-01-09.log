17:48 +share: i was
17:48 * Bazerka actually takes a look at the code
17:49 +shabble: compared to _set_time, which behaves how you'd expect
17:49 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 98 seconds
17:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share_]
17:50 +shabble: ie: 1m30s is valid, etc.
17:51 +Bazerka: sure
17:52 +Bazerka: but since when are datasizes ever described using that format? :)
17:52 +share_: xand: i hold ctrl and left nothing happens
17:52 +xand: mouse button?
17:52 +Bazerka: if something is 1.5MB, you don't say 1M500
17:52 +share_: oh lol
17:52 +share_: :) now it works
17:53 +shabble: but you can't say 1.5MB either, iirc :)
17:53 +Bazerka: sure, but I'm simply rebutting your comparison to _set_time and your example above :)
17:53 +shabble: I just came across it when tr ying to document how it worked
17:53 +share_: xand: alt q or o is disabled?
17:54 +shabble: and was surprised at how user-unfriendly it was compared with time :)
17:54 +share_: esc + q works
17:54 +xand: what?
17:54 +share_: xand: in xterm
17:54 +share_: alt+q doesnt function
17:56 +xand: WFM
17:57 +share: ?
17:58 +share: anyway im happy with gnome terminal
17:58 +share: :P
17:58 +Myrtti: terminator ftw
17:59 +Bazerka: hmm
17:59 +Bazerka: actually, this has exposed a different bug I'd forgotten about
18:00 +share: Bazerka: can you update nicklist.pl in http://scripts.irssi.org/
18:00 +Nei: in xterm, you want ctrl+left click & check "... sends escape" to make irssi happy, which expects esc
18:00 +Bazerka: reutilising setting names within different types
18:00 +share:  there is a new version that supports ~ & modes
18:00 +share: bye coekie
18:01 +share: by
18:01 +Bazerka: share: you are aware that nicklist.pl is written by the main developer of irssi and that he's more than capable of updating it himself?
18:01 +share: hm
18:01 +share: maybe he forgot gonna pm
18:01 +Bazerka: we don't arbitrarily update scripts on the archive without being asked to by the script's author
18:02 +Nei: just avoid scripts.irssi website and try to locate authors websites if you want the latest versions
18:02 +share: k
18:03 +Bazerka: and more to the point
18:03 +Bazerka: it's 0.4.6 on s.i.o *AND* the author's site
18:03 +share: sio?
18:03 +Bazerka: what's in the author's git is NOT the release version
18:03 +Bazerka: it's a development version
18:04 +Bazerka: you're talking about 0.4.6+ and that's the git version
18:04 +share: hm it works :)
18:04 +Bazerka: sure, but it's not the release version
18:04 +Bazerka: and hence, won't be on s.i.o under any circumstances
18:05 +Bazerka: and given that it's the git development version, nothing requires updating
18:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Quex01]
18:12 +Bazerka: shabble: hmm, something isn't quite working right (surprise, surprise)
18:12 +Bazerka: ./irc/dcc/dcc-autoget.c:        settings_add_size("dcc", "dcc_autoget_max_size", "0k");
18:12 +Bazerka: /set dcc_autoget_max_size 100shekles
18:12 +Bazerka: |09/01 17:11:16| [dcc]
18:12 +Bazerka: |09/01 17:11:16| dcc_autoget_max_size = 100shekles
18:13 +shabble: it's stored internally as a string and parsed each time, I think?
18:13 +Bazerka: so you should be able to set non-sensical values given that
18:14 +Bazerka: my point is, the behaviour isn't consistent
18:15 +shabble: yeah, you do get 'invalid size' for some values
18:15 +shabble: is it worth me filing as a bug?
18:16 +shabble: I've just been fighting with gdb to try and figure out that osx /exec no output thing.
18:16 +shabble: and I still haven't a clue
18:16 +Bazerka: hmm
18:17 +Bazerka: I've now repeated your test from above but with a different setting name, and it works how you expected
18:17 * Bazerka boggles
18:18 +Bazerka: /script exec Irssi::settings_add_size("foo", "testval", "0"); Irssi::settings_set_size("testval", "5000"); print Irssi::settings_get_str("testval"); prints 5000
18:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Axius]
18:18 +Bazerka: oh, you were using unquoted values
18:19 * Bazerka retries without the quotes
18:19 +Bazerka: that works the same
18:20 +Bazerka: ah
18:20 +share: Nei: yes thanks for the tip :P 4 bitlbee scripts outdated
18:20 +share: etc
18:20 +Bazerka: doh, typo'd the final method
18:20 +Bazerka: should be get_size
18:21 +Bazerka: heh, more coffee required
18:22 +Bazerka: they aren't really outdated
18:22 +Bazerka: the author has two sets of scripts with the same name, depending on some external version iirc
18:22 +Bazerka: ah yes, depending on the bitlbee version
18:23 +Bazerka: so I dunno how he expects us to handle that given the script names are the same
18:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Mjiig]
18:25 +share: ^
18:25 +Bazerka: I don't use bitlbee, so I need to ask, is bitlbee < 0.3 even still relevant these days?
18:26 +nilicule: 0.3? wow, talk about seriously ancient code
18:27 +share: Stable: 3.0.1
18:27 +share: 2010-11-24
18:27 +Bazerka: er, *3.0
18:27 +Bazerka: clearly a typo
18:27 +share: lol but im using BitlBee 1.2.8-1
18:28 +Bazerka: share: well, the updated scripts are for 3.0+
18:30 +Bazerka: so the versions on s.i.o (with the excepting of blist script are all up to date with the author's versions for pre 3.0 bitlbee
18:30 +Bazerka: *exception
18:30 +share: yes
18:30 +share: restoring scripts from trash!
18:30 +share: :p
18:30 +Bazerka: heh
18:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CEnTR4L]
18:31 +nilicule: oh if s.i.o would only let you sort on last updated *sigh*
18:32 +shabble: how would that help? Not much use there being a brand new script to do foo when you need to do bar :)
18:32 +share: lol
18:32 +share: dudes explain me that "story" about foobar
18:33 +Bazerka: nilicule: if only it would let you do lots of things :)
18:33 +share: ppl keep saying foo and bar whats the meaning
18:33 +vague`: share, google it.
18:33 +share: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar

19:05 +share: is there a script to search text in irssi
19:05 +share: currently i use lastlog thing
19:06 +yitz_: lastlog works swell
19:06 +yitz_: You could turn on logging and grep log files, too
19:06 +share: hm
19:07 +Bazerka: there's sb_search.pl too (which comes bundled with newer irssi versions)
19:08 +yitz_: It's not on scripts.irssi.org?
19:08 +Bazerka: none of the official irssi scripts are
19:08 +Bazerka: because they come *with* irssi
19:08 +yitz_: Oh...
19:08 * yitz_ rebuilds irssi
19:08 +share: hm
19:09 +yitz_: git pull? Fail. bzr pull? Fail. hg? Not installed. /me checks www.irssi.org
19:10 +yitz_: Ooh. svn :D

19:13 +Koffa: where did that come from o,O
19:13 +share: i have that command lol
19:13 +yitz_: Cool. sb_search scrolls to the match, hrm? Interesting
19:13 +share: maybe a old script
19:14 +share: not
19:14 +Koffa: nope
19:14 +Koffa: wtf
19:14 +share: Koffa: do you have /sethost?
19:14 +Koffa: yeah

19:14 +Koffa: I do and I don't
19:14 +Koffa: nice

19:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v delhage]
19:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v joneal]
19:16 +delhage: can you get irssi to load previous channel logs on startup, so that you maintain history between sessions (like xchat does)?
19:16 +Koffa: dunno if this is at irssi.org yet but ... http://explodingferret.com/linux/irssi/logresume.pl
19:16 +Koffa: ^delhage
19:17 +delhage: Koffa: thanks, I'll try it
19:18 +Koffa: delhage: np
19:18 +Koffa: it doesn't do themes, but otherwise quite nice

20:56 +ski: ah, right, ty
20:56 +Bazerka: np
20:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v gnomefreak]
20:57 +ski: (i looked at `scrollback',`backlog',`search',`find', but didn't find it)
20:57 +Bazerka: there's also a script with new irssi versions called sb_search.pl that provides /scrollback search
20:57 +Bazerka: *newer
20:57 +share: ski: it's found in /usr/share/irssi/sb_search.pl
20:58 +Bazerka: share: no, it's found wherever the package puts it
20:58 +share: oh
20:58 +Bazerka: and irssi automatically searches the correct path if the package was built correctly
20:58 +Bazerka: so you can just /run sb_search.pl
20:58 +share: you could add it to irssi scripts page because many ppl dont know about it
20:58 +Bazerka: for the last time
20:58 +share: i just discovered it today
20:58 +share: ! Lol
20:59 +Bazerka: it comes *WITH* irssi itself
20:59 +share: i have an idea
20:59 +share: put a line on the site saying that
20:59 +share: " some scripts come with irssi" :p
21:00 +Bazerka: most users completely ignore the documentation and inbuilt help anyways
21:01 +Bazerka: or so it seems ;)
21:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Sp4rKy]
21:01 +share: Bazerka: one question
21:01 +share: the lag_check_time option is only to make "Lag:" visible
21:01 +share: in act bar right
21:02 +share: or lag_min_show
21:03 +share: why would i want those options if i have lag_max_before_disconnect = -1
21:03 +Bazerka: lag_check_time is the period of lag that must have passed before that lag warning is shown
21:03 +Bazerka: iirc
21:04 * Bazerka looks
21:04 +Bazerka: ah no, it's the period of active lag checks
21:04 +share: to ping server?
21:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
21:06 +Bazerka: yes
21:06 +share: but only if i want to know if i am lagged right
21:06 +share: it doesnt matter if i ping it or not i get lagged anyway
21:06 +Bazerka: is there a question in there somewhere?
21:07 +share: no
21:07 +share: am i right? is question
21:07 +share: :p
21:08 +Bazerka: lag_min_show is used to dictate when the lag status bar item is visible
21:08 +share: ye
21:08 +Bazerka: if lag goes above that (and you have the lag item in your status bar and it is not disabled), the lag item will be shown

21:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v loadedwithwyrms]
21:22 +xorrbit: I'm in a small-width setup and there's a ton of wasted space where message text could be
21:23 +Koffa: I'd like to have "sane-rewrap"
21:27 +xorrbit: If I could even just disable the indenting that would be nice
21:28 +mauke: this is probably a format thing
21:29 +Babar: yes it
21:29 +Babar: argh
21:30 +Babar: can't find it anymore, but iirc, there is a setting for that
21:31 +mauke: you could edit your theme and remove all %|
21:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v gnomefreak]
21:31 +xorrbit: hmm a bit hackish but I guess if I must
21:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ahihi]
21:40 +shabble: /set indent or yeah, hunt the %|'s
21:41 +xorrbit: /set indent doesn't do anything :/
21:41 +shabble: then you're stuck with some theme-a-jigging
21:42 +xorrbit: yeah, shitty
