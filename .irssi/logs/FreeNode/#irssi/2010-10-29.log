02:05 +acidjazz: graci
02:05 +Dirm: /set hostname is for choosing from one of multiple local interfaces
02:05 +Dirm: it's kind of a misleading name, so people often try to use it for other things

04:19 +dark3lf: example, I want to send a private message to MyFriend in irssi channel, so "/msg #irssi MyFriend hello how are you ?" will appear in irssi window but it will be private
04:20 +Dirm: you don't send private messages in channels
04:20 +Dirm: messages are sent either publicly to channels or privately to users

04:21 +Dirm: you can open a query with the user and put it in the same window as the channel
04:21 +dark3lf: yes, but it can just appear in the channel window, isnt ?
04:21 +Dirm: /query myfriend
04:21 +Dirm: er rather
04:21 +Dirm: /query -window myfriend
04:22 +Dirm: and then ^X to switch between the query and the channel
04:25 +dark3lf: Dirm, I wish I could laugh at a sentence of somebody with a friend with a comment just below.. that is unfortunate:P
04:25 +Slizzurd: /msg NICK msg      if your on the same server
04:26 +Slizzurd: You can specify the network the NICK is on
04:26 +dark3lf: Slizzurd, but this will open a new window ?
04:27 +Slizzurd: No
04:28 +Dirm: I generally just repaste the sentence to my friend in the query window
04:30 +Slizzurd: dark3lf: Yep, like that
04:33 +dark3lf: Slizzurd, but the private message did not appear on the channel, it appear in a new window
04:33 +dark3lf: you saw it here ?

06:06 +swoody: tmr: cygwin, and I don't see that option in 'Preferences' :/
06:07 +tmr: swoody, that's better, beep and beep_beep allow you to run custom command on [D[Dbell.

06:18 +eboyjr: Would there happen to be a script which converts the regexp into the replacement of the last thing they said?
06:18 +eboyjr: Just sounds like an interesting idea
06:18 +jayne: I've heard of one, but I forget its name / where it lives
06:19 +jayne: personally, I think it's less than useful because it's rare for anyone to be rigorous enough with their regexp that it would actually do what they intended
06:20 +eboyjr: hrm at least a normal str_replace maybe.. ill look around though

08:22 +ds187: vice versa ogf course.....the default is that the 20th window is called "20" and not really mapped at all......i just want to map some further windows also to letters, like the first 19

15:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v openess]
15:07 +Bazerka: http://www.irssi.org/ChangeLog
15:07 +ArmOrAttAk: that's onlt the latest version
15:08 +ArmOrAttAk: only rather
15:08 +Bazerka: which contains every change in every release prior to it
15:08 +Bazerka: so it contains the subset of information you are looking for
15:09 +ArmOrAttAk: that was not the case yesterday
15:10 +Bazerka: I beg to differ
15:10 +Bazerka: irssi's Changelog is *always* a full history changelog
15:11 +Bazerka: perhaps you were looking at the release changelog and not the full changelog?
15:11 +ArmOrAttAk: BS i was there yesterday clinking that link on previous versions and they all pointed to the latest version only
15:11 +Bazerka: http://www.irssi.org/ChangeLog <- full svn changelog history
15:11 +ArmOrAttAk: somebody has changed the link
15:12 +Bazerka: http://www.irssi.org/news/ChangeLog <- release specific changelog
15:12 +Bazerka: and no, the links certainly haven't changed
15:12 +ArmOrAttAk: i asked the question again just now from my buffer
15:12 +ArmOrAttAk: oh
15:12 +ArmOrAttAk: i see
15:12 +ArmOrAttAk: thanks
15:13 +ArmOrAttAk: but still the links to previous versions all point to the latest
15:13 +Bazerka: indeed, because we only cover the latest release
15:14 +Bazerka: http://svn.irssi.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/irssi/trunk/NEWS?view=markup&revision=5133&root=irssi
15:14 +Bazerka: if you want earlier versions
15:18 +coekie: I think we used to list more than just the latest
15:19 +coekie: and the mentioned of bug numbers used to produce links to the actual bugs (but maybe the syntax used now is just different)
15:19 +shabble: is the changelog auto-generated?
15:19 +Bazerka: shabble: which one? :)
15:20 +shabble: the one in the svn tree
15:20 +coekie: http://www.irssi.org/ChangeLog , yes, the NEWS file is written manually, and news/ChangeLog is automatically generated from NEWS
15:20 +Bazerka: there is none in the svn tree
15:20 +Bazerka: ChangeLog is generated from svn log
15:20 +shabble: hmm, I seem to have one in the svn tree I've got, but it's marked as svn:ignore
15:20 +shabble: so I can only assume it's generated somewhere/how
15:21 +coekie: it's generated from "svn log"
15:21 +Bazerka: you built irssi from inside your tree?
15:21 +shabble: yeah
15:21 +shabble: bad form? :)
15:22 +Bazerka: no, but that explains why you have a changelog :)
15:22 +Bazerka: autogen.sh -> update_changelog.sh ==> Changelog
15:22 +Bazerka: iirc
15:22 +shabble: ah yes, there's an update_changelog.sh
15:22 +shabble: oh, too late ;)
