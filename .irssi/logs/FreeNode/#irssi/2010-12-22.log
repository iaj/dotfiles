10:11 +vague`: JeffJohnson, nm.pl changes the theme.
10:12 +vague`: Well, in the running env, a /save then saves the changes to the files affected.
10:12 +JeffJohnson: mmh the default theme restores old alignment

16:44 +Quaxir: Is it possible to run 2x irssi's on single ubuntu-server?
16:44 +tmr: Yes.
16:45 +Quaxir: tmr: Is it easy/mid/hard to get working :)?
16:45 +jnpplf: Don't see why it would be
16:45 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v catsup]
16:45 +jnpplf: Run irssi. Run irssi again.
16:46 +jnpplf: Would be wise to pass it two different configs ;)
16:46 +tmr: Rather irssi homes, if you're running both under same user, though that hardly makes sense.
16:47 +Quaxir: Point of 2 irssi's is just to get 2 nicks on same server, need it for special purpose :). How can I define which config-files each irssi uses?
16:48 +jnpplf: --config or --home, 'man irssi' :)
16:48 +tmr: Or you could just use one irssi..
16:48 * jnpplf wonders if you could just connect to one network twice
16:49 +jnpplf: Think that probably answered my question

17:04 +FernandoBasso: Is it possible to print non printable characters in irssi?
17:04 --- dhruvasagar is now known as zz_dhruvasagar
17:04 --- zz_dhruvasagar is now known as dhruvasagar
17:04 +jnpplf: Err
17:05 +jnpplf: print non printable characters?
17:05 +nisshh: FernandoBasso, oh the irony :)
17:05 +FernandoBasso: Like, in vim insert mode ^v<Return will show a ^M
17:06 +billnye: FernandoBasso: have you TRIED ^V?
17:06 +billnye: :)
17:06 +FernandoBasso: But in irssi? Is it possible? Otherwise I will have to memorize them, because now and then I need them.
17:07 +jnpplf: You need to send non-printable characters to IRC chans? o.O
17:07 +FernandoBasso: In irrssi?
17:07 +billnye: FernandoBasso: yes.
17:07 +billnye: [15~
17:07 +billnye: F5
17:07 +FernandoBasso: billnye: Wha about <Return>
17:08 +vague`: FernandoBasso, -what- is the purpose of this?
17:08 +FernandoBasso: I am in gnome-terminal. Could it be the problem?
17:08 +billnye: FernandoBasso: it's not going to work with enter, that's your "send text" key
17:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ryzer]
17:09 +FernandoBasso: vague`: sometimes I need to talks about non-printable chars, and being able to send them helps a lot.
17:09 +FernandoBasso: I use gnome-terminal or urxvt with irssi, because they make possible to open links directly.
17:10 +vague`: ^M<enter> !!
17:10 +jnpplf: Just drop out of irssi and type it into 'cat'?
17:10 +billnye: FernandoBasso: how is ^V<control I> easier than shift-6I
17:11 +tmr: billnye, you know his kb-layout?
17:11 +billnye: tmr: ;)
17:11 +jnpplf: And enter doesn't come up in cat...
17:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fahadsadah]
17:11 +vague`: FernandoBasso, I'm probably stupid but could you explain the scenario again? Like talking to a 5 yo?
17:12 +FernandoBasso: vague`: I know ^M by heart. But I don't know the others.
17:12 +vague`: FernandoBasso, that's not any clearer.
17:13 +vague`: If we actually understood what your goal was, maybe we could think of a solution for you.
17:13 +billnye: (which we may have already done, but without knowing what we're aiming for, it's harder to judge)
17:13 +FernandoBasso: I don't know the others. If I happen to talk about them, I have to memorize them first.
17:13 +billnye: FernandoBasso: THEM what?
17:13 +FernandoBasso: The non-printable characters.
17:14 +billnye: give us an example situation you'd be trying to solve
17:14 +vague`: This has to be a troll...
17:14 +billnye: that's what vague` is trying to ask you
17:14 +FernandoBasso: I needed to send a vim macro today, but was not able becouase when I pasted into irssi window, the charactes were converted to something else.
17:14 +vague`: I'm this close --><-- to giving up.
17:15 +billnye: FernandoBasso: irssi will interpret the text you paste to it, yes
17:15 +FernandoBasso: I had to send one line, and I had to use a pastebin, and show a screeshot.
17:15 +FernandoBasso: scrennshot*
17:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v surgeon_]
17:16 +FernandoBasso:  let @t='YPP:s/[ a-zA-Z]/*/g2j:s'
17:16 +FernandoBasso: This is not like the original line.
17:16 +jnpplf: So is there a command to not parse those characters?
17:16 * jnpplf has a feeling there is
17:16 +FernandoBasso: http://metabox.it/unK5R.png
17:19 +jnpplf: Nah, I might be thinking of /quote
17:19 +jnpplf: Not sure if that would work or not
17:20 +billnye: FernandoBasso: I'm not sure what that screenshot is demonstrating
17:20 +jnpplf: /quote MSG <text to not parse>?
17:20 +billnye: jnpplf: not if it has an enter in it :)
17:20 +billnye: or tabs, or, or or.
17:22 +FernandoBasso: It is demonstrating the 'correct' non-printable line, in line 288. (the other terminal in the bottom right is unrelated).
17:23 +billnye: FernandoBasso: does the .vimrc not support the \ method of escaping EOL mid-string?
17:24 +FernandoBasso: billnye: It probably does. However, I'll have to investigate this.
17:25 +FernandoBasso: billnye: But, why?
17:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v zrajm]
17:32 +billnye: FernandoBasso: you have two questions that you're getting confused/tied up
17:33 +billnye: FernandoBasso: irssi supports, just as vim does, the ^V syntax when entering by hand
17:33 +billnye: you're pasting over cleartext, so you can't count on the other end to correctly handle and display nonprintables anyway
17:34 +billnye: but that's the question you originally asked, and it's possible just fine when doing it by hand
17:34 +FernandoBasso: billnye: Makes sense. You are right. Thanks.
17:34 +billnye: the other question is regarding pastes being interpreted by irssi instead of sent as-is, and that's just a factor of irssi being a terminal app, more than anything else
17:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v annecy]
17:36 +billnye: my question about /<enter> in strings was because even over pastebin, that's the more robust way of writing that particular case
17:38 +FernandoBasso: Okay. I am a little overwhelmed by this non-printable characters, as today was the first day I needed them. So, all this is new to me.
17:38 +FernandoBasso: Thanks you, and all for helping.
