00:01 +yitz_: https://github.com/IsaacG/Scripts -> I wrote me a bash script to go through Tweets with... Good for processing lots of items, one by one?  :D That script'll display one by one and let me scroll through them, mark them for "save" (to dump out afterwards) and - most importantly - copy URLs to clip so I don't need to find the mouse and click URLs
00:04 +ahf: o.O

00:08 +yitz_: Any way to clear/remove the top item in a window?

01:43 +atxq: was wondering how I could hide system messages in irssi?
01:43 +mauke: what's a system message?
01:44 +atxq: I want to hide messages like join, quit
01:45 +mauke: /ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS
01:45 +atxq: thanks
01:45 +atxq: then /save would save the setting?
01:45 +mauke: yes
01:46 +atxq: is there a way to highlight certain words used in a chat like user names and stuff like that?
01:47 +mauke: /help hilight
01:47 +atxq: thanks
01:54 +atxq: so when I run irssi, I want to connect to a server and join a chat automaticly
01:54 +atxq: how would I go about doing this?
01:58 +yitz_: See the startup section of the FAQ?
01:59 +atxq: I was wondering what keyword I can use when using /help to get information about this topic?
02:01 +yitz_: /help server   see -auto
02:01 +yitz_: And /help channel   see -auto

11:38 +dschingis: hi, i have googled quite a bit, but i couldn't find a solution: how do i configure irssi to not show channel activity when someone joins or leavs?
11:40 +dschingis: or maybe show a distinguishable from normal activity
11:40 +Remco: /help ignore
11:40 +Remco: Or do you mean the activity in the act bar?
11:41 +Geert: /set activity_hide_level JOINS
11:41 +Remco: Indeed
11:50 +dschingis: hmm, is it possible to only apply activity_hide_level to certain channels?
11:51 +shabble: there's a patch somewhere that allows you to use /ignore's to prevent hilights
11:52 +dschingis: i will go with ignore for now and see how it works out, didn't knew one could ignore more than useres
11:52 +shabble: in fact, it's here: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/blob/master/patches/irssi-svn-r5174-no_act_ignore.patch

15:42 +crazygir: hi! Is it possible to get a list of open windows (the names of the channels you are connected to) as opposed to just the numbers?
15:42 +Bazerka: in your activity list?
15:44 +crazygir: I often have 10 - 20 windows open, but am on a slower link, so finding the channel I'm looking for is a slow process
15:44 +crazygir: yes
15:44 +crazygir: or somewhere else
15:44 +Bazerka: if you're running a modern version of irssi : /set actlist_names on
15:44 +crazygir: I often just need to know the window number for a specific channel
15:44 +Bazerka: there's also /window list
15:45 +Bazerka: which will dump all the active window items for each window to your status window
15:45 * crazygir tests
15:45 +Nei: or one of the scripts which shows number+key+channel
15:45 +crazygir: ah, really cool, the activity bar doesn't roll over to additional lines?

15:52 --- xayon is now known as XayOn
15:52 +XayOn: Hey dudes, is there a way I can look at wich scripts are making irssi slow? From while to while it gets stuck for a few seconds.
15:54 +shabble: maybe with gdb, but it'd be a hassle
15:54 +shabble: what scripts are you running?
15:55 +shabble: I'd be suspicious of anything that does blocking file or network IO
15:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v thoas]
15:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Qvist_]
15:58 +XayOn: shabble: I use lots, that's the problem
15:58 +XayOn: I've got 34 scripts loaded
16:02 +XayOn: I've got some main suspictious ones. The first one: autowhois + a script by myself wich gets the whois signal and adds information for the user gotten from my agenda, calling an external process for doing so...
16:03 +XayOn: The second one nicklist.
16:03 +Bazerka: Nei: it was papering, and huh? my comment was wrt trackbar issues, not adv_wl
16:03 +disc: :)
16:10 +Bazerka: XayOn: are you forking when you call that external process?
16:13 +XayOn: Bazerka: oh, good one. I'll see (it's a old script, I can't remember right now). I'm disabling all those ones to see if performance gets better. Is there any way to unload all the scripts and re-load just the ones on autorun or will I have to unload them one by one?
16:14 +Bazerka:  /script reset
16:14 +Bazerka: will reset the perl interpreter and thereby clears all loaded scripts
16:15 +XayOn: will it re-activate the ones on autorun/?
16:15 +XayOn: Oh, I see, it won't.
16:15 +Bazerka: no, you'll need to re-load the scripts you want
16:16 +XayOn: =/ Would have been easyer to unload just the ones I was disabling. 10... of 34 =P
16:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v damyan]
16:17 +XayOn: Bazerka: Well... confirmed that it's a script, it's not failing anymore =)
16:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
16:22 +Bazerka: if you're calling an external process from a script that may take an appreciable amount of time, you should really fork and use pipes
16:22 +Bazerka: that way irssi won't block on waiting for the external process to finish running
16:23 +XayOn: Bazerka: I know, anyway it should not be taking an appreciable amount of time. real 0m0.048s
16:23 +XayOn: And it should be running only when someone querys me. So I'm looking for the problem elsewhere
16:23 +Bazerka: right, but is it that quick every time?
16:24 +Bazerka: as you say it's only occasionally you see irssi getting slow
16:24 +XayOn: Bazerka: It's processing a 10 lines file... don't think it can take much more
16:24 +Bazerka: so it must be another script then :)
16:25 +Bazerka: (ignoring a high system io load which could increase the time taken to read said file)
16:25 +XayOn: That's it. I have some other scripts by myself, I'll be checking them out. (Recently I had one that were frozing my system)
16:27 +XayOn: I got the concept of libnotify plugin, using passtrough printing to get alerts, and fifo_remote, to get alerts trough irssi from external programs, then I made a procmail rule to launch an alert trough irssi every time I got mail. I disabled that script for a while... and when re-enabled, well, it sputs al lot of alerts at the same time, freezing irssi.

19:01 +riot: vague`: thanks alot. I was suspicious about maybe installing the wrong plugin ;)

19:05 +echelon_: how do i enable logging for only a specific network?
19:07 +billnye: echelon_: several different options, none of them /particularly/ native, depending on your exact usage details
19:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Xilov]
19:15 +echelon_: also, would it be possible to have a hostname setting only for a specific network?
19:16 +billnye: /help network
19:16 +billnye: (strange place to hide it, I know ;D )
19:16 +echelon_: oh! awesome :)
19:17 +echelon_: so i can unset the global setting :D
19:18 +billnye: on the logging front, how many networks are you on / what's the channel distribution between networks (un/logged) / how dynamic is your channel listing (especially on unlogged networks)
19:19 +echelon_: i just have one network that i connect to that i need logging for, which is a bitlbee server
19:19 +echelon_: and i connect to.. 4 others
19:19 +echelon_: and i would just need pm's to be logged on the bitlbee server
19:20 +billnye: what logging formats are acceptable, and what use method do you currently have interface-wise
19:21 +billnye: by formats I mean "how do you need to refer back to the info"
19:22 +billnye: bitlbee can do a handful of very different things as regards translating to IRC-isms, and likewise irssi can do different things with that "output"
19:23 +echelon_: the default irssi logging format is fine
19:23 +billnye: again, that wasn't the sense I meant "format"
19:23 +echelon_: oh
19:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Zed`]
19:24 +billnye: partly my fault for choosing an overloaded word in this context, but I saw that coming :)
19:24 +echelon_: i don't need irssi to load it back into the screen using /backlog or anything
19:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Ci-Dev]
19:27 +yitz_: I got that nifty notification over sshscript setup. Now I got to extend that to do URLs... On URL, send it over ssh and launch it in FF?
19:28 +billnye: yitz_: you don't view irssi on the notification machine?
19:28 +yitz_: I do. But I don't like having to use the mouse to find and click URLs
19:29 +billnye: you wouldn't use it to FIND, I imagine
19:29 +yitz_: "Select" it
19:29 +billnye: if they're clickable, you wouldn't need to select, is my point
19:30 +yitz_: Yesterday I did a bitlbee/tweet reader script in bash to go through my tweets with xclip support so I can load URLs into xclip
19:30 +yitz_: Clickable still requires moving the mouse to the URL
19:30 +billnye: and there are options for taking the "find" out of the equation entirely
19:30 +yitz_: I'm trying to cut the mouse out of the equation
19:30 +billnye: yitz_: okay, that's my question :)
19:31 +yitz_: By "find" I mean navigating the mouse to the link *shrug*
19:31 +billnye: yitz_: I suggest one of the url launcher scripts, launching a roll your own method of getting the info to the browsy machine
19:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Kraftwerk]
19:32 +yitz_: Speaking of which, I should tweet that twitter reader script to support directly opening the URLs in a rowser instead of going via xclip...
19:35 +yitz_: On the odd chance that someone is interested, this is my twitter reader script: https://github.com/IsaacG/Scripts/blob/master/tweetread  It shows one line of text at a time from the input file, lets you scroll up/down, xclip/launch URLs and toggle "save" to save select lines for later

20:20 +Death4Li1e: use -autosendcmd
20:20 +j`brims: thanks, i'll try it
20:21 +Bazerka: -botcmd
20:21 +Bazerka: -autosendcmd is for commands to be sent on connecting to the server, not joining a channel

21:19 +nemo: Is there a way to move a window in irssi? I'd like to move a specifc channel to alt-2
21:19 +nemo: (and let the existing alt-2 become, oh, alt-3 etc, just bump 'em all up 1)
21:19 +nemo: or even just swapping would be fine I guess
21:19 +Ticho: change to the window you want to move, and do /window move 2

23:04 +bassliner: so how do i define a keyboard shortcut in irssi that will, on the first use, set my client away with a default away message, and on the 2nd use set me back? thanks.
23:05 +deepy: See /help toggle
23:06 +bassliner: deepy: that will work for boolean settings i could set using /set only, but not for stuff like /away, right?
23:06 --- Smiley__1 is now known as Smiley
23:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v preller]
23:11 +Zed`: bassliner: I use one alias for away '/a' ~ does all my away and '/back' for coming back from away
23:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kody]
23:11 +sjk: bassliner, perhaps you could check the contents of $A - if you have an away message set $A will be set as well.
23:12 +bassliner: sjk: that would lead me to have to write a script i think.
23:13 +bassliner: Zed`: that's cool, but i wanted to avoid having to use 2 commands so i can use just one hotkey for going away or back.
23:13 +Zed`: bassliner: I hear ya
23:13 +sjk: bassliner, I would probably create an alias for it (/alias myaway script exec ...) and then /bind some key to it
23:14 +bassliner: sjk: looks reasonable, tho i probably would have to write such a script...
23:14 +bassliner: hmm
23:14 +sjk: yes of course! :)
