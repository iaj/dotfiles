09:17 +ds187: if i change putty to iso 8859-15 then i can see umlauts, but not if putty is set to utf-8.......the quastion is, is this a putty or an irssi issue?
09:29  grosboulet: Hello
09:31 +tolecnal: ds187: http://irssi.org/documentation/faq - "How to make UTF-8 support work with irssi?"
09:31 +tolecnal: ds187: requires that your terminal uses an UTF-8 aware charset
09:32 --- Death4Li1e is now known as Death4Life
09:32 +tolecnal: ds187: and seeing as you're having issues with umlaut, I'm guessing you should have de_DE.UTF8
09:33 +ds187: tolecnal: i know.....screen has utf8, shell has utf8 and irssi is also set to utf8....as well as putty
09:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v met]
09:33 +ds187: i have en_US.utf8
09:33 +tolecnal: you started screen with -U ?
09:33 +ds187: tolecnal: in another window of the same screen session umlauts work fine....just in the irssi window they won't work
09:34 +ds187: tolecnal: yes, and ctrl-a i also shows utf-8
09:34 +tolecnal: pastebin the output of /set term
09:34 +tolecnal: and /set recode
09:34 +ds187: and this problem is only here at work with putty, at home with gnome-terminal accessing the same screen-session i have no problems
09:35 +tolecnal: and you're sure that putty has set 'translation' to UTF-8?
09:36 +ds187: http://pastebin.com/6sF2TWkK
09:37 +ds187: yes, i am sure
09:38 +tolecnal: hmmm, my only differences is that I have recode_fallback and recode_out_default_charset set to 'ISO8859-1', apart from that we have the same
09:39 +tolecnal: though what puzzles me is that it works from your gnome terminal at home, though not with putty from work
09:40 +ds187: that puzzles me to.... :-)
09:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Steve57]
09:45 +tolecnal: hmmm, I just don't know I'm afraid (oder soll ich sagen, es tut mir leid)
09:45 +ds187: is this looking like an umlaut? Ã¶
09:45 +ds187: you are not afraid, you are sorry :-)
09:45 +ds187: oder so :-)
09:45 +ds187: (ok, afraid geht auch)
09:46 +tolecnal: not an umlaut
09:47 +ds187: :-/
09:48 +ds187: perhaps i just don't go to work anymore, because at home everything is fine.....sounds like a plan :-)

11:14 +projmon: hello good sirs, can i bind ctrl+arrow in irssi?
11:16 +jink: Not sure.  Why? :)
11:16 +projmon: i want to scroll up and down in the chat
11:16 +projmon: ctrl+J was not a good key
11:17 +projmon: it screwed up my enter
11:17 +jink: Heh. :)
11:17 +projmon: so now im trying ctrl-down
11:17 +jink: pageup and pagedown should work by default.
11:17 +projmon: also alt-j did not work
11:17 +jink: meta-j should work just fine.
11:17 +projmon: meta-j works but im on mac osx
11:17 +jink: Ah. :)
11:17 +projmon: so it screwes up my alt
11:17 +jink: Blame your terminal. ^__^
11:17 +projmon: -e
11:18 +jink: Or configure it properly.
11:18 +projmon: not sure how
11:18 +jink: I don't use a mac, but I know there's a way to make it work.
11:18 +projmon: but why is ctrl-J bound to enter?
11:19 +jink: They're the same key, according to the terminal.
11:19 +jink: ctrl-i is tab, ctrl-m is enter, too.
11:19 +jink: (One is enter, one is return, I think.)
11:20 +projmon:  >_<
11:20 +jink: :D
11:20 +projmon: so what about binding ctrl+arrow
11:20 +projmon: why is that so difficult :-S
11:21 +jink: Not sure.  (But I already said that.)
11:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pif]
11:21 +jink: If alt (or option) doesn't work, you can do esc j

11:39 +projmon: sry my inet went down
11:39 +projmon: is there anyway to bind ctrl+arrow keys?
11:39 +kakarssi: Hi, how can I make a rule to ignore JOINS/QUITS/NICKS/PARTS on all channels but N. (A whitelist instead of a blacklist)
11:40 +kakarssi: I really only want those in one channel and not have to add all channels
11:40 +neo10101: hi! kakarssi
11:40 +kakarssi: Hi
11:41 +neo10101: go to the www.irssi.com/script
11:41 +neo10101: you'll find lots of about that
11:41 +kakarssi: Well, I wanted to try with /ignores, is that not possible with uilt in features?
11:42 +vague`: kakarssi, see /help ignore
11:42 +kakarssi: I read that. I am having a problem with formulating the correct -except rule
11:42 +projmon: i just found pgup/pgdn on my keyboard, shift+fn+up/down. that will do
11:43 +projmon: thanks guys
11:43 +kakarssi: I have /ignore * JOINS QUITS PARTS NICKS
11:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ghoti]
11:43 +vague`: kakarssi, why not say that then instead of just complaining?
11:43 +kakarssi: But I have not found a way to unignore one specific channel
11:43 +vague`: kakarssi, which version of irssi are you running?=
11:43 +kakarssi: How do I find out?
11:44 +vague`: /sv
11:44 +kakarssi: 0.8.12
11:44 +kakarssi: Irssi 0.8.12 (20071006) - http://irssi.org/
11:44 +vague`: kakarssi, ok, upgrade. Or set the except rule before the global ignore
11:45 +kakarssi: I don't know how the except rule should look like
11:45 +vague`: /ignore -except -channel #blah * JOINS QUITS PARTS NICKS
11:46 +vague`: -channels*
11:47 +kakarssi: 1 #blah: NICKS QUITS PARTS JOINS -except
11:49 +kakarssi: /ignore now says that it ignores everything from #blah
11:50 +vague`: Did you remove the global ignore first?

11:53 +vague`: nov 09 11:50:21    5 #irssi: JOINS PARTS QUITS MODES -except -network freenode
11:54 +l-b: Hello! Is there a built-in way to keep specific channels from notifying me on irssi's statusbar that they have new messages? (e. g. to reduce cluttering)
11:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Yvemath]
11:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v neo10101]
11:55 +l-b: I don't want to ignore messages, just supress the notifications
11:55 +jink: l-b: /set activity_hide_targets
11:55 +vague`: l-b, see /set activity
11:55 +l-b: that sounds worth to be pursued, thanks jink and vague` :)
11:57 +kakarssi: what line did you use to get your 5th ignore rule vague` ?
12:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kakarssi]
12:01 +l-b: I just added some channels to the activity_hide_targets and set activity_hide_level = PUBLIC. I hope that hilights will still set off alarms now :)
12:02 +Barlow: yes it will
12:05 +l-b: thank you :)
12:05 +jink: Could be me, but why would anyone want to hide PUBLIC ?  Hiding parts, joins, quits, modes I can understand, but public..? :/  Kinda defeats the purpose of act, not?

12:49 +vague`: But the except rule has to come before the generic rule due to a bug in 0.8.12
12:51 +Barlow: yes, but at least it worked in 0.8.12. in .15 it not working for me at all
12:54 +vague`: I'm not sure but could be the except rule has to come -after- the generic rule in 0.8.15 :)
12:57 +Barlow: hm but that remove my other ignores for that channel
12:57 +Barlow: +s
