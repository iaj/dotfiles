00:09 +Ziber: Whats the best way to count the number of items shown by Window::items()?
00:11 +Zed`: fingers?
00:12 +Ziber: ha ha.
00:12 +Ziber: Seriously, apparently its not a normal array...
00:12 +Ziber: Though it seems like a hash, its not quite that either, because scalar didnt work.
00:13 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peeaivo]
00:13 +Zed`: heeh sorry I ma not a programmer, stick around, someone will answer :)
00:13 +Ziber: haha, alright. and yeah, sooner or later someone will probably answer, but i tend to be impatient when trying to figure something out.
00:15 +Nei: probably just a list?
00:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v agentgasmask]
00:16 +Nei: that you could count with something like scalar @{[ ...->items() ]}
00:17 +Ziber: Well, or loop through it, keep an iterator and return it. :D
00:17 +billnye: is there an acronym for There's More Than One Way To Do It But Your Way Is Wrong! ? ;)
00:18 +Ziber: Hm?
00:19 +agentgasmask: Hi folks, Irssi pauses when connecting to freenode after saying "xxx..freenode.net *** Found your hostname" then says "xxx..freenode.net *** No Ident response". Is there something I need to do so it will send a response? Or is there something else I can do to make this move faster?
00:19 +Ziber: My way does give the correct value.
00:20 +billnye: I didn't mean to imply that it'd be inaccurate
00:20 +billnye: just Wrong(tm)
00:21 +billnye: (and it was a /bit/ tongue-in-cheek... "ha-ha-only-serious")
00:21 +Ziber: well, your way works too :P thanks.
00:21 +billnye: I didn't have a way
00:22 +Ziber: oh, whoever it was.
00:22 +Ziber: Nei: thanks.
00:22 +billnye: hehe BillNei
00:22 +billnye: (the sceince gei)
00:23 +Ziber: how do you use hilight levels in conjunction with others, btw?
00:23 +agentgasmask: Any help?
00:24 +billnye: agentgasmask: run identd?
00:24 +billnye: Ziber: can you just apply a list of levels instead of one?
00:25 +agentgasmask: billnye: what is identd?
00:26 +Ziber: billnye: well... how would you do that, with Channel::printformat()?
00:26 +billnye: a server-ish program (hence the "blahblahblah...d" name format) that answers identity queries
00:27 +agentgasmask: billnye: so your saying that I should write my own? What is freenode/irssi looking for?
00:28 +billnye: agentgasmask: not suggesting anything of the sort
00:28 +billnye: Ziber: doesn't http://irssi.org/documentation/perl give info on printing to a certain level(s)?
00:28 +agentgasmask: billnye: So identd exists?
00:28 +billnye: I'm not sure what you mean exactly by "use" levels
00:28 +Ziber: doesnt seem to help with trying to use multiple ones.
00:28 +billnye: agentgasmask: in many different incarnations
00:30 +billnye: agentgasmask: if you're in charge of the computer running irssi, it should be trivial to install and run an appropriate identd program for your system
00:30 +Ziber: with printformat, you can specify the level of the message, such as "MSGLEVEL_ACTION"...
00:30 +agentgasmask: ok, I see what your talking about now.
00:30 +agentgasmask: billnye: ok, I see what your talking about now. Thanks :)
00:30 +billnye: Ziber: and you see nothing at all, perhaps very nearby, about printing to more than one? ;D
00:30 +billnye: agentgasmask: np
00:31 * Ziber looks again... 
00:31 +Ziber: I'm seemingly missing something obvious, but no, I dont.
00:32 +billnye: perhaps in the paragraph introducing levels, which would seem a very salient part to read? ;D
00:33 +Ziber: $server->print("#channel", 'Hello, world', MSGLEVEL_CLIENTCRAP); <-- The only example of the command that they give in that paragraph only uses one level.
00:34 +billnye: your claim is not incorrect, as worded
00:34 +Ziber: HILIGHT_CLIENTCRAP?
00:35 +Ziber: instead of 'msglevel_'?
00:35 +billnye: Ziber: read the darn intro paragraph ;D ;D ;D
00:35 +Ziber: i am...
00:35 +Ziber: Oh.
00:35 +Ziber: :/
00:35 * Ziber feels stupid and goes to apply that
00:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Mechanim1l]
00:35 +billnye: don't feel stupid... feel unobservant :)
00:37 +Ziber: but... does that apply to the "special levels" as well? ACTIONS+HILIGHT?
00:38 +billnye: I'm not able to answer that, but I'm guessing you have the tools necessary to try it and see
00:38 +billnye: which also makes me curious, speaking of tools, how printlevels.pl handles multi-level messages
00:38 +Ziber: It would appear not.
00:38 +Ziber: [18:38:09] Bareword "ACTIONS" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at /home/ziber/.irssi/scripts/multi_action.pl line 29.
00:38 +Ziber: [18:38:09] Bareword "NOHILIGHT" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at /home/ziber/.irssi/scripts/multi_action.pl line 29.
00:39 +Ziber: Line 29: $chan->printformat(ACTIONS+NOHILIGHT, "action_public_channel", $nick, $chan->{name}, $data);
00:39 +billnye: wouldn't you need the MSGLEVEL_ like in your pasted example?
00:40 +Ziber: Seemingly not.
00:40 +billnye: ...
00:40 +Ziber: "like ACTION+PUBLIC"
00:40 +Ziber: or MSGLEVEL_ACTION+MSGLEVEL_PUBLIC"?
00:40 +Ziber: the above was quoted from that intro paragraph.
00:41 +Ziber: Oh.
00:41 +Ziber: MSGLEVEL_ needs to preceed them both.
00:43 +Ziber: Alright, now the question becomes how to make it trigger as normally channel activity, since it didnt seem to before?
00:43 +Ziber: Like, the opposite of NOACT?
00:44 +Ziber: Ah. MSGLEVEL_ACTIONS+MSGLEVEL_PUBLIC
00:44 +Ziber: Thanks for that hint. :)
00:45 +billnye: wouldn't ACTIONS be fine for notification even without PUBLIC?
00:45 +Ziber: Seemingly not. Though I would think so, yes.
00:45 +Ziber: But, through experimentation, ACTIONS+PUBLIC got me the result I wanted.
00:53 +Ziber: and now, ofc, comes the next problem. what if the text should be hilighted?
00:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mingdao_]
00:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v keith]
00:59 +billnye: are your prints invisible to /hilight ?
00:59 +Ziber: Hm?
00:59 +Ziber: I tried triggering a hilight (when I'm hilighted in my current setup, the window activity number changes color), and it didnt work.
01:01 --- Guest82445 is now known as share
01:01 +billnye: "triggering" in what sense?
01:01 --- share is now known as Guest48617
01:02 +mow: if anyone is interested in what I was talking about earlier, this works => /exec -o tail -f ~/.irssi/logs/blah/blah  | grep --line-buffered blah
01:02 +Ziber: Well, I'm running this script on a second irssi, and I tried saying the nickname of that in an action, which would trigger a highlight, usually.
01:02 +billnye: mow: what syntax wasn't working?
01:03 +mow: tail: cannot open `/home/mow/.irssi/logs/blah/blah' for reading: No such file or directory
01:03 +mow: tail: no files remaining
01:03 +mow:  /exec -o tail -f ~/.irssi/logs/blah/blah  | grep blah
01:03 +billnye: "the nickname of that"?
01:04 +Ziber: the nickname that im using in that irssi.
01:04 +billnye: FROM that irssi?
01:04 +billnye: I know nothing you say will trigger your own hilight, I don't know if the same applies to everything you print
01:05 +Ziber: No, from this one.
01:05 +Ziber: Specifically because I'm displaying the text with the PUBLIC level, not the hilight level. But I dont know of a way to check to see if the text should be hilighted or not.
01:06 +Ziber: Hang on.
01:06 +billnye: this is all too short on detail and too long on speculation... I'm going to respectfully bow out
01:07 +Ziber: sorry.
01:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v richo]
01:15 +richo: shabble: I think I just made a whoopsie.
01:17 +richo: Maybe I should have stuck with my fork and sending you pull requests. Anyway, ping me when you get this so we can get it fixed. I can't find any undo button on github, but I don't want to just commit a patch putting it back because that would be even kludgier I think? I thought git had support for winding stuff back.
01:24 +billnye: richo: nothing helpful in google for "git undo"?
01:25 +billnye: I'm no git'r (dun!) but http://book.git-scm.com/4_undoing_in_git_-_reset,_checkout_and_revert.html looks informative at least
01:26 +richo: tried that
01:26 +richo: I think that's meant ot be before you do a git push
01:26 +richo: but also, it looks like shabble merged some of my changes into master which I'm not sure was deliberate either
01:26 +billnye: I... don't think that link is /a/ "that"
01:26 +billnye: I think it's a whole suite of various "thats"
01:27 +richo: so I'm waiting to herre back from him
01:27 +richo: billnye: I mean, I've already found that guide and tried it's git incantations
01:27 +billnye: at least some of which seemed to be suitable for post-push, if I'm translating "made public" properly
01:27 +richo: sounds like I need to just do another commit with the reverse
01:27 +richo: it would really help if git didn't use the word
01:27 +richo: "commit" in like 5 different contexts.
01:28 +billnye: does it ever in its syntax?
01:28 +shabble: richo: hey
01:28 +shabble: what's the problem?
01:30 +richo: shabble: Couldn't work out how to get it to commit to richoH-dev, wound up accidentally committing to master, but there's also a commit from 3 days ago from "me", which was the result of that pull request
01:30 +richo: but I thought that was meant to go into richoH-dev too?
01:30 * richo is confused now
01:55 +shabble: richo: I'm a tad busy just now, but will have a look at it shortly
01:57 +richo: shabble: No rush mate. I just didn't want you to login two days down the track and go "ZOMGWTF. What has richo done?!"

02:19 +billnye: (right?)
02:19 +Ziber: eventhough im planning to just use this for my own purposes, so i can hardcode my own hilights, but, if i wanted to distribute it, id have to compile a list of the hilights that whoever set up.
02:20 +richo: when you do a whois, you can see if the nick is identified
02:20 +Ticho: su
02:20 +Ticho: oops :>
02:21 +billnye: Ticho: INVALID PASSWORD PLEASE TRY AGAIN
02:21 +richo: does irrsi store that data locally, if a nick is ID'd?
02:21 +richo: or do I need to whois every nick...
02:21 +Ticho: billnye: damn, but i was so sure that y0urm0m is the correct password
02:22 +billnye: YOUR MOM IS THE CORRECT PASSWORD...! OHHH
02:22 +billnye: oh wait...
02:23 +Ticho: :>
02:33 +Guest73132: hello
02:36 * richo changes all his passwords to "yourmom" folloowed by 32 asterisks
02:38 +Ziber: billnye: any suggestions on how to do that?
02:40 +richo: Ziber: I can think of a really hideous way I think?
02:41 +Ziber: Well, feel free to share, I guess.
02:41 +richo: hook the print function
02:41 +richo: print the text
02:41 +richo: inspect the return value
02:41 +richo: ie, in the hooked print function, have a look at the flags with which it's printed
02:41 --- tonsofpc1 is now known as tonsofpcs
02:41 +richo: I think there's a HILGIHT flag or somesuch?
02:42 +richo: but, it's REALLY ugly and only occurs to me because I did it a few days ago
02:42 +billnye: richo: that sounds like it fits the spirit of the request but not the letter
02:42 +Ziber: yes, there is. but thats only triggered when some piece of code decides that the shown text matches what should be hilighted based on hilight settings, etc.
02:42 +richo: Ziber: Where does that happen though? After the print hook?
02:42 +billnye: Ziber: correct me if this paraphrase isn't accurate: "How can I enable hilights for things that my scripts say, not just things other people say?"
02:43 +Ziber: billnye: in a sense, but my script is printing things that people say...
02:43 +richo: billnye: afaik he's wanting to test whether or not a string will set off a highlight? No?
02:44 +billnye: Ziber: the source doesn't matter.
02:44 +billnye: richo: that sounds like it'd fit
02:44 +billnye: but not "whether it would", "whether it should"
02:44 +richo: ah
02:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vincent_wang]
02:44 +richo: good point
02:44 +richo: I will have a play with this tonight.
02:44 +Ziber: im a bit lost...
02:45 +billnye: Ziber: irssi doesn't care where you get the things that you print()
02:45 +billnye: it doesn't care if it's the pledge of allegiance or the russian launch codes
02:45 +billnye: it's just printin' stuff
02:46 +Ziber: yes, i figured that. i just want a way to check whether or not im supposed to print it with hilight or not, depending on the text itself.
02:46 +billnye: you want to trigger hilights BECAUSE you're echoing what would otherwise be normal IRC traffic (if I'm gathering your aforementioned-short-on-detail intentions correctly), but the why doesn't actually factor in
02:47 +billnye: I'm just trying to help you articulate (to richo and anyone else who cares to lend a brain) what your request is
02:48 +Ziber: alright, to fill you in on my short-on-detail stuff. my script's intention is to print the channel name when someone (including myself, eventually) does an action, if the window has multiple items.
02:49 +billnye: I take it print_active_channel doesn't handle ACTIONS?
02:50 +Ziber: it does not, no.
02:50 +Ziber: http://ziber.org/multi_action.pl.txt <-- what i have so far.
02:51 +Ziber: list items was a way to test how to get the number of items in a window.
02:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share]
02:52 +richo: Ziber: my brain is not in a state to deal with this at the moment
02:52 +richo: However, if you email me about it, it sounds interesting and I would like to take a look
02:52 +share: :)
02:52 +Ziber: sure. feel free to PM/notice/whatever an email address.
02:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share_]
02:53 +richo: richo@psych0tik.net
02:54 +Ziber: alright.
02:54 +richo: Cheers
03:00 +Ziber: sent an intro :p
03:02 +Ziber: honestly, i could just write a hardcoded highlighting for my own nickname...
03:03 +richo: Pfft
03:03 +richo: That would bad bad
03:03 +richo: would be bad
03:03 +richo: I spent god knows how long hacking at shabble's script just because I didn't want to have to have my channel configs in two places..
03:03 +Ziber: yeah. but is there a prebuilt way to do what im trying to do?
03:03 +richo: dunno. Probably not
03:04 +richo: a lot of "obvious
03:04 +richo: stuff seems to be missing from the API
03:04 +billnye: I think a better question is "is there a good reason why actions don't trip the print_active_channel formatting change?"
03:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hpt]
03:05 +Ziber: yep, that is a better question. and considering it doesnt, i guess i have no way to do it but write one myself.
03:06 +Ziber: and, additionally, why doesnt own_action_target trigger either?
03:06 +billnye: what's own_action_target ?
03:07 +Ziber: a format option, seemingly for formatting a /me in a window with multiple items.
03:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nhandler]
03:08 +billnye: it's an abstract... is it ever called?
03:08 +Ziber: havent investigated that... not quite sure how to.
03:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share]
03:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share_]
03:11 +billnye: looks like ownaction_target is the abstract, and called in own_action_target on my in-use theme
03:11 +Ziber: in mine:
03:11 +Ziber: [21:11:42] own_action = {ownaction $0}$1
03:11 +Ziber: [21:11:42] own_action_target = {msgchannel $2} {ownaction_target $0}$1
03:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share]
03:12 +Ziber: own_action_target never seemed to get called, which is why i decided to write this script in the first place.
03:12 +billnye: as I said, own_action_target calling ownaction_target, which is likely (in yours as it is in mine) defined above
03:13 +share_: later
03:13 +billnye: doesn't EXPLAIN anything, it's just useful overview
03:13 +Ziber: yes, and considering everything is defined... shouldnt it be triggered?
03:13 +billnye: nothing in the theme dictates WHEN the theme elements are use
03:13 +billnye: used*
03:14 +billnye: aside from abstracts being called, etc. etc.
03:14 +Ziber: right.
03:15 +billnye: so a) it appears the theme expects the feature we see missing, b) is this a bug?
03:16 +Ziber: i imagine it might be a bug, yes.
03:16 +Ziber: i suppose what im planning will be the solution?
03:16 +Ziber: and considering i doubt im the first one to write a script to intercept and print differently incoming text, someone has to have run into the highlighting problem before, right?
03:17 +billnye: Ziber: pardon the french but fuck no it's not going to be THE solution
03:17 +billnye: :)
03:17 +Ziber: a/the/a
03:17 +Ziber: s/a/mine
03:17 +Ziber: :)
03:17 +billnye: :) that's up to you
03:18 +billnye: my first inclination would be "how bad would it be if every action had a channel label...?"
03:18 +Ziber: this is only going to be used in windows with multiple items, first of all.
03:18 +Ziber: in a multi-item window, "how bad would it be if every action DIDNT have a channel label...?"
03:19 +billnye: I understand your aim, yes
03:19 +billnye: just stating that my approach would be to work with the theming rather than subvert irssi's message handling ENTIRELY
03:20 +Ziber: it would be an easier, more direct way of dealing with things, i guess. but you just said the theme wouldnt be much/any help because all the abstracts just call each other...
03:20 +Ziber: itd be an internal trigger some where in the source.
03:20 +billnye: no, I said the theme itself isn't any help at fixing the bug
03:21 +billnye: nor is your script
03:21 +billnye: anything aside from fixing the bug (source edit) in this case is a hack
03:21 +Ziber: where would i start looking in the source, then?
03:21 +billnye: mine just as hacky as your proposal... I claim no high ground, just stating my own perspective
03:22 +Ziber: yours is a more solid solution, though.
03:22 +Ziber: if i found it in the source, i could simply just add the channel name somehow.
03:22 +billnye: mine is also not without side effects
03:22 +billnye: if you found it in the source, you could just fix the bug :P
03:23 +billnye: assuming (nobody else has commented) there's not some Good Reason(tm) that it behaves as it does now
03:26 +Ziber: i find it hard to believe that this was intentional, but yes, that is a possibility.
03:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mroconnor]
03:26 +billnye: I think I'm as incredulous as you are that it's DESIRED
03:27 +billnye: but don't know enough to be sure it's not INTENDED (in the sense that it may be a compromise with other factors), if that makes sense
03:27 +Ziber: yes, nor do i, but from what i do know, it makes no sense at all.
03:28 +billnye: well actions are funky messages
03:28 +Ziber: technically CTCPs, yes.
03:30 +billnye: <nod> "messages" but not PRIVMSGs
03:30 +Ziber: exactly. but, irssi, seemingly in other areas, as most irc clients, treat and display them the same.
03:31 +billnye: ...ish
03:31 +billnye: ;)
03:31 +Ziber: well yes, which is why im still convinced this wasnt intended.
03:35 +richo: Ziber: is the reason for this some glaring hole in irssi's core functionality?
03:35 +richo: is it because it already puts the channel name before everything else, but not ACTION?
03:35 +richo: Seems like effor would be better spent just fixing that upstream
03:36 +Ziber: which is why billnye and i are now talking about how to fix this in the core, yes.
03:36 +richo: oh
03:36 +richo: I didn't look up
03:36 +richo: my bad
03:37 +Ziber: not that i have the faintest clue where to start looking, though.
03:37 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v share]
03:38 +billnye: grep the source for own_action_target perhaps?
03:38 +richo: just start editing random files
03:38 +richo: million monkey principle
03:38 +billnye: richo: dammit, you beat me to the monkeys :<
03:38 +Ziber: haha, i'll start grepping.
03:38 +Ziber: but, first, brb.
03:38 +Ticho: getting a typewriter? :>
03:38 +richo: can only assume
03:38 +limon: is there anyway to command to connect another server, from irssi client to irssi proxy-server?
03:39 +billnye: limon: ssh <_<
03:39 +limon: billnye: is not an easy way :(
03:39 +Gryllida: why
03:39 +Gryllida: blah
03:40  Gryllida: why difficult?
03:41 +limon: open another shell, and connect, and connect. I'm looking 1 step command :)
03:41 +billnye: limon: why is it something that's happening often enough that it matters how many steps?
03:42 +billnye: (as opposed to connecting on the proxy to where you'd want to connect, and then mix and match on the client end as you like)
03:43 +limon: billnye: ok, for example, i connected A and B servers on proxy. I want to join B/C channel not A/C. How can i do that?
03:44 +billnye: limon: /help join ?
03:44 +billnye: that's basic irssi functionality, not proxy/client level
03:47 +limon: billnye: ok but i tried /join #C. it joins A/C not B/C.
03:48 +billnye: that's nice. /help join some more
03:48 +limon: i'm trying join on client side not proxy side.
03:49 * billnye desperately resists the urge to hit the up arrow again
03:51 +billnye: if you're phobic about using the /join command, you might try reading the bars in the status window (or any other itemless window)
03:51 +billnye: TIM TOWTDI, after all

03:53 +billnye: richo: is that a euphemism? :<
03:53 +richo: depends
03:55 +limon: billnye: when i tried /join with -<server tag>, it says not connected to server...
03:56 +billnye: limon: you're using your LOCAL server tag names, not the remote ones?
03:56 +limon: in my local irssi, i have just one tag Proxy, i'm using this
03:57 +billnye: then in your local irssi you are connected to only one remote network.
03:57 +billnye: fix that.
03:57 +billnye: :)
03:57 +limon: yes, just my irssi-proxy. But in my irssi-proxy i have 2 server
03:58 +billnye: your local irssi is only connected to one of those.
04:00 +richo: you local one knows nothing of the other remote one
04:00 +billnye: of one of the remote ones
04:02 +limon: ah, crap. I need one port every remote server. Thanks for help
04:02 +billnye: limon: yep, np
04:03 +billnye: once you have that set up, the rest of the advice should fall into place :)
04:04 +billnye: although if you like, I could probably come up with at least one or two other ways to join a particular channel on a particular network :D :D:D
04:05 +richo: Hah
04:06 +richo: I can think of one
04:06 +richo: :P
04:06 +billnye: off the top of my head I might be stuck at the /tag alias as a 3rd
04:07 +richo: join+
04:07 +richo: the script that shabble wrote and I hacked at
04:07 +richo: does exactly what you want :D
04:07 +billnye: then 4 ;)

05:15 +richo: I'm trying to find out if a nick is auth'd to nickserv without having to do a whois
05:16 +tmr: Ipozya, try using server password instead "Ipozya:yourpass".
05:16 +Ipozya: tmr: i'm sorry, what do you mean?

12:35 +Myrtti: right?

12:37 +jaacoppi: if you're inside gnu screen just use screen copypaste
12:38 +PhilipPhilip: Ah, so I should use irssi in screen?
12:38 +jaacoppi: if in console, use gpm or something similiar

15:10 +harrisonk: what command is it to display the channels on a server?
15:12 +billnye: harrisonk: the /list command isn't usually the best method if any other options are available
15:12 +harrisonk: okay
15:13 +billnye: i.e. channel listings through chanserv or another service (alis here on freenode), an official or unofficial web listing (http://netsplit.de), etc.
15:13 +harrisonk: why is it not a good idea?
15:14 +billnye: harder on the network, and it could flood you offline :)
15:14 +harrisonk: billnye: what command is it on chanserv then
15:14 +billnye: harrisonk: that's up to each network's services package
15:14 +billnye: there is no standard I'm aware of
15:14 +harrisonk: freenode for example
15:14 +billnye: /msg alis help

15:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jk4]
15:22 +jk4: hi how to list all channels
15:22 +jk4: ?
15:24 +Nei: "all"?
15:24 +jk4: I'm looking for a strength training channel
15:26 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v mroconnor]
15:26 +Zed`: Why does this not work? /alias fbon window goto 20; say account 1 on - they 'say' seems to happen before the window command....
15:26 +Nei: on freennode (this network) you can /msg alis list *substring* to search for channels containing that part, but I doubt they have strength training here
15:27 +Nei: http://irc.netsplit.de has a lot of public channels listed
15:28 +jk4: awesome
15:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v psychonautlib]
15:35 +psychonautlib: Hi. Connection to a irc network sometimes automaticly joins channels. Only these channels are NOT defined in the config. Can I prevent these unwanted joins?
15:36 +Nei: is it a script causing them? or is the server joining you to these channels?
15:36 +Zed`: psychonautlib: check /channel list
15:38 +psychonautlib: Server is causing the joins
15:38 +Nei: then see if the server is offering some way to disable that
15:38 +psychonautlib: Can't I block it from within irssi?
15:38 +Nei: otherwise you can only "work around" this issue eg by parting them
15:39 +billnye: my question is WHY is the server joining you to channels you didn't intend
15:39 +psychonautlib: Zed`: channel list is not the problem. Not defined here
15:40 +psychonautlib: billnye: good question :) I don't know, but it does
15:41 +billnye: what are the channels?
15:42 +billnye: is this a bug? a policy? a redirect channel? an overflow channel?
15:42 +Zed`: how else can irssi auto connect to a channel unless it is in the channle list or a script?
15:42 +Zed`: channel*
15:42 +psychonautlib: network is anonops
15:43 +Zed`: what is your /set join_auto_chans_on_invite ?
15:43 +billnye: Zed`: they'd still be in /channel list.
15:43 +psychonautlib: Zed`: I don't know
15:43 +tmr: Zed`, server can force join.
15:44 +psychonautlib: Ah, join_auto_chans_on_invite is on
15:45 * psychonautlib testing now with off
15:45 +tmr: That doesn't make any difference _unless_ you've configured that channel as -auto and you're invited to it.
15:46 +psychonautlib: I see, still auto joined
15:47 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v keith]
15:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ryzer]
15:53 +catsup: psychonautlib: yeah, irssi can't prevent the join.  irssi just receives notification that you have been joined, from the server.  the server joins you.
15:53 +catsup: the closest irssi could come is to not report that you have been joined
15:53 +catsup: which you could probably hack in there by intercepting the event but i don't recommend it ;)
15:54 +psychonautlib: Very anoying this server behaviour :(
15:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v peeaivo]
15:55 +psychonautlib: is it possible to exec any script after the connect. This scrip can then part the channels.
15:59 +catsup: sure you could also part on join
15:59 +catsup: better to trigger on the join than the connect, of course
16:01 +psychonautlib: okay, I'm going to try somethings. Thanks guys!
16:01 +catsup: see the irssi events doc
16:01 +psychonautlib: ok
16:02 +catsup: you'll be writing a two line script
16:02 +catsup: fuck i should just do it for you...
16:02 +psychonautlib: I would like that
16:02 +catsup: s/events/signals
16:05 +psychonautlib: where is this event doc
16:06 +Nei: you listen on the join and stop the signal & reply with a part
16:06 +billnye: I still want to know what's being joined and why :)
16:07 +catsup: Irssi::signal_add('channel joined', sub { my $crec = shift; $crec->command('part '.$crec->{name}) if $crec->{name} eq "#whatever"; });

16:18 +catsup: oh
16:19 +catsup: you'll want $crec->{name} =~ m/#news|#lobby/i

16:23 +psychonautlib: Where to put this code. In config?
16:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v anon33_]

16:30 +psychonautlib: catsup: Got it working. Thanks.
16:30 +catsup: great
16:31 +catsup: btw the signals doc is http://irssi.org/documentation/signals
16:32 +psychonautlib: Interesting, will look into it
16:39 +psychonautlib: catsup: one little drawback. If I try to join the defined channel, it wil also part :) Not really a problem.
