21:01 +maveas: Hi. Can I get irssi to join channels after it registered with nickserv?
21:03 +Babar: here? Yeah, put user:pass as your server password
21:03 +Babar: so you'll be automagically registered
21:03 +maveas: I've already setup the auto cmd to register?
21:04 +maveas: But the way you describe works?

21:06 +maveas: Just found the cmdspeed which might do the trick :)

21:27 +maveas: Hmm. I might be a bit confused but I'm not able to find any information regarding altering a network entry in the client with /network
21:29 +maveas: I've already tried /network add existingNetwork -autosendcmd "blah; blah" to add wait but it doesn't seem to work. Do you really have to remove the network and add it once more?
