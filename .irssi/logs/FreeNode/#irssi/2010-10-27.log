14:14 +esom: hi guys
14:14 +esom: irssi in cygwin is slow
14:15 +Ticho: ok
14:15 +Ticho: thanks for the info
14:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v hyperair]
14:17 +esom: it's not a problem, I think most people use irssi win32 port under windows
14:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Sh3r1ff]
14:18 +Zmx: I think most people don't use win with irssi
14:19 +jink: If PuTTY doesn't count. ;)
14:19 +esom: Zmx: maybe, people use win probably stick to xchat
14:19 +Zmx: obv ;)
14:19 +Zmx: (for putty)
14:20 +ChoHag: Not necessarily. Sometimes people use win because they like linux but the year of linux on the desktop never quite arrives.
14:20 +ChoHag: A lot of the linux admins by me here use win with a decent terminal app rather than some linux gui abortion.
14:21 +Bazerka: huh?
14:21 +Bazerka: going off on a tangent, are we? :)
14:21 +ChoHag: People who use windows don't necessarily do so because they are slaves of the gui, so don't necessarily use xchat.
14:21 +ChoHag: Also, xchat is awful even if you *are* a gui slave...
14:22 +esom: ChoHag: right
14:22 +Bazerka: if it came down to a choice between xchat and mirc, I'd use xchat :)
14:22 +ChoHag: But yeah, slight tangent. I'm hungry and my fellow admins will go out for lunch in Just One More Minute...
14:22 +Bazerka: but yeah, best of a bad bunch choice
14:22 +jink: irssi > xchat > mirc > bitchx :P
14:23 +Bazerka: hah
14:24 +Zmx: and, where is weechat ? :D

14:29 +deathnote[]: Hello
14:31 +deathnote[]: Is it common for Irssi outputing 'Attempting to free unreference scarlar....' under Cygwin on WIndows 7
14:31 +deathnote[]: If not, the Irssi screen gets currupted time to time. I haven't expierence this issue in WinXP with Cygwin before
14:32 +esom: deathnote[]: the first time i run irssi in cygwin win7 it cored
14:32 +deathnote[]: esom: I had the cored dump once
14:33 +deathnote[]: So, it's common
14:33 +deathnote[]: Question is, is it a Irssi issue or Perl issue or Cygwin issue
14:33 +ds187: windows7 issue ;-)
14:33 +deathnote[]: pff, not
14:33 +deathnote[]: heh
14:34 +deathnote[]: If I report a bug, should I report a bug to Irssi?
14:34 +Bazerka: not really, no
14:34 +Bazerka: cygwin isn't a supported platform
14:34 +deathnote[]: hmmm, but you do release a windows version of Irssi coupled with cygwin?
14:34 +esom: i guess irssi relies on some library that aren't fully implemented in cygwin
14:34 +Bazerka: and if it worked on previous cygwin builds, that sounds like a problem with cygwin not irssi
14:35 +Bazerka: deathnote[]: no, that's a 3rd party build
14:35 +Bazerka: not an official build
14:35 +deathnote[]: Bazerka: On WIndows XP, worked fine
14:35 +Bazerka: then it's a problem with cygwin on w7
14:35 +esom: mine is win7 64bit
14:36 +deathnote[]: 64 bit as well
14:36 +Bazerka: which irssi are you actually using? the win installer on our site or the actual cygwin irssi package in a full cygwin environment?
14:36 +deathnote[]: Alright, i know who to attact
14:37 +deathnote[]: Bazerka: The actual Irssi package from a full cygwin environment

14:39 +Bazerka:  /sv
14:40 +rvsjoen:  /version
14:40 +Bazerka: no, /sv spams it here too
14:40 +Bazerka: so, /sv
14:41 +deathnote[]: Irssi 0.8.15 (20100403) - http://irssi.org/
14:41 +deathnote[]: Is that the latest version
14:41 +Bazerka: yes
14:41 +deathnote[]: Ok

17:00 +w3rdn4: one last question how do you go from one channel to another ?
17:03 +koollman: w3rdn4: ctrl-n / ctrl-p , alt-<window number>, alt-a (that one is nice)
17:03 +koollman: there are other ways,of course
17:05 +w3rdn4: thanks
17:05 +w3rdn4: that is awesome!
17:05 +Nebulae: alt + left/right arrow, if you get to 20 or so
17:06 +Nei: assign numbers/letters to your windows
17:06 +Nei: or hack together a mouse click based window switcher
17:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v FernandoBasso]
17:06 +yitz_: Ewww
17:06 +Nei: there are a lot of ways
17:06 +Nei: :>
17:06 +yitz_: Or use alt-a
17:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v azizLIGHTS]
17:07 +azizLIGHTS: is there a script to monitor when a nick comes online
17:07 +yitz_: /help notify
17:07 +w3rdn4: see on a mac alt- windows number doesn't work :(
17:07 +w3rdn4: unless you have to press another key for alt to be engaged
17:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisB1y]
17:08 +Nei: you can usually use Esc, number as an alternative. since most unix terminals translate alt+x to Esc, x
17:08 +Nei: other than that i would check your mac terminal settings
17:08 +jink: Correct.  Or you can use a different terminal emulator, or fix the settings.
17:09 +Nei: of course, you can always re /bind to something that works
17:09 +Nei: (if there is anything, hehe)

17:21 +Zmx: trop loin :-)
17:23 +billnye: Nei: it's not uncommon for various terminals to need some "persuasion" to treat alt as the "proper" meta key

17:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SS3]
17:50 +shabble: did they even make it into later versions of windows? I remember them from Win3.11 days
17:50 +bombshell: Anyone know of a good google script
17:50 +shabble: where setting them on someone elses machine and readonly-ing the config file was the height of hilarity
17:50 +Nei: iirc they were present at least in all the 9x/ME
17:50 +Nei: maybe even in XP
17:50 +billnye: Nei: judging by the options still available on most theming sites for most apps, I assume SOMEBODY was using them
17:50 +Nei: scary
17:50 +billnye: *on most user-generated theming
17:51 +Nei: I certainly wouldnt want them to mistake my computer for a hot dog stand
17:52 +shabble: I remember one place I saw where the admins had a horribly bright theme set of all admin accounts
17:52 +shabble: so they could tell at a glance if someone was doing something they shouldn't be, and ot remind them to be careful :)
17:52 +Nei: might even make sense as a kind of warning pattern
17:53 +shabble: I've seen people do it with terminal backgrounds or prompts, as well
17:53 +Nei: true, a red root prompt seems to be common
17:54 +shabble: also red = production, blue = testing, green = dev, or something like that
17:54 +shabble: for those "I accidentally the database" moments :)
