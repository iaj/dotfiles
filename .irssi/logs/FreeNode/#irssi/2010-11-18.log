16:15 +open`: hi guys
16:15 +open`: I hope someone can help me with this -- but I fear that I'm perhaps asking too much
16:15 +billnye: yep, sorry, we don't handle that here.
16:16 +billnye: O:)
16:16 +open`: I use the script nm.pl -- http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/images/screenshots/snapshot-261209-2309.png
16:16 +open`: which makes nick look right-justified like that
16:16 +open`: I also use another script, gtrans.pl - which translates messages with google translate
16:17 +open`: I want to modify gtrans.pl so that the translations it throws back are justified in a similar manner (it'll make for easy reading)
16:17 +open`: essentially, I just want like 3 spaces before the bracket, that's it
16:17 +open`: I was hoping someone could point out what I would modify here: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/gtrans.pl.html as my understanding of perl is nil :(
16:18 +billnye: open`: are you using the dynamic margin or the nick-coloring aspects of nm.pl?
16:18 +open`: billnye: both
16:18 +open`: billnye: I'll take a screenshot, that'll make my request and other things clear - just a sec please
16:18 +billnye: if you're using dynamic margins, I don't know of any good way
16:18 +billnye: because if you do "3 spaces" now, it'll shift when someone longer shows up
16:19 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v izibi]
16:19 +open`: http://i.imgur.com/eyY5w.png
16:20 +open`: I'll looking to move the [es:0.43] <the english translation statement> 3 spaces to the right (as you can see from the ss, it'll then be aligned with the rest of the stuff)
16:21 +open`: hm, maybe it would be best if it looked like [    es:0.53] <the translation>, or something like that. that should be easily doable, right?
16:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v oliphant]
16:23 +open`:  billnye| because if you do "3 spaces" now, it'll shift when someone longer shows up <-- I'm not using dynamic margins -- if someone with a longer nick joins, it doesn't expand and reset - it just truncates his nick
16:23 +open`: I think I have the length limit set to 10 spaces
16:25 +Koffa: what was the syntax to cut strings
16:26 +Koffa: even ircnet nowadays supports terrorism :(
16:26 +billnye: open`: that's not dynamic :)
16:27 +billnye: open`: fixed-width margin on chat doesn't require scripting, which was why I asked
16:27 +billnye: open`: so essentially you're using nm.pl as nickcolor.pl (which is fine)
16:28 +Koffa: hmm
16:29 +open`: hm, ok. billnye: line 348 here: http://scripts.irssi.org/html/gtrans.pl.html - if I were to change "[%s:%.2f] %s" to "|   %s:%.2f| %s"
16:29 +open`: do you think that's a reasonable change? i.e.
16:30 +open`: the escapings, and everything else, is ok by perl. (I do have I escape spaces?)
16:30 +Koffa: w t f
16:30 +open`: did I say something stupid? :(
16:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v sud0]
16:30 +Koffa: it's not possible to do $[length]var on theme?
16:30 +open`: do I have to escape additional spacings* I rather meanth
16:30 +Koffa: some other way to do this thingamalingie
16:36 +tmr: Koffa, what are you trying to do?
16:37 +Koffa: cut long nicks... I'd also like to clean up some of the weirdest ones :)
16:37 +tmr: I would use /formats for that, well the cutting part anyway.
16:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tyebud]
16:39 +tmr: Right aligned nicks tip should cover all needed formats.
16:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
16:40 +Koffa: hmm
16:40 +Koffa: I tried that format (obviously not by right-aligning) and got empty string
16:41 +open`: billnye: sorry to be bothering you - but small question
16:41 +billnye: Koffa: well you're saying "I tried exactly that but different"
16:42 +open`: billnye: I have (seemingly) achieved what I wanted - http://i.imgur.com/0MUYw.png
16:42 +Koffa: bullshit
16:42 +billnye: Koffa: that leaves a questionmark on what exactly you did try
16:42 +Koffa: .
16:42 +open`: my question is, following what you said about the margins being dymaic or not, as you can see in that window -- the margin WAS reset (to my surprise). With what would I set the margin to a fixed value?
16:42 +tmr: Koffa, you mean you did $[-9].. -> $[.9]..?
16:43 +open`: the margin was reset when I changed my nick to a longer one, that is
16:43 +Koffa: tmr: yes
16:43 +tmr: Should work then..
16:43 +billnye: open`: that's what I said about nm.pl
16:44 +open`: billnye: hmm ok. but I'm finding this very bizarre, because I remember trying to set these values - and in playing with values, see the effect reflect the values I would set
16:44 +billnye: open`: /set neat
16:44 +billnye: I don't have it loaded to tell you the right combination of settings
16:44 +tmr: Koffa, paste exact command you tried.
16:44 +open`: billnye: /set neat_maxlength 10
16:44 +open`: right? that should do it?
16:45 +open`: billnye: /set neat_maxlength 11
16:45 +open`: whoops, was supposed to try that
16:45 +Koffa: wtf... it made the exact same change to default.theme as far as I can see and now it works... why wouldn't it work with direct edit
16:45 +Koffa: /reload fscks smth o,O
16:45 +billnye: open`: but smaller lengths might still mean smaller margins, if everyone in the channel is 8 long
16:46 +open`: billnye: ahh, http://scripts.irssi.org/html/nm.pl.html
16:46 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v kkady32]
16:46 +open`: line 84 -- is that a solution to this problem?
16:47 +open`: well no, that's talking about padding, which I think is not something we're concerned about
16:48 +open`: billnye: but ok, I think I will choose to live with this. and god forbid I enter a channel where everyone has 3 letter nicks, I'll be the troll and do a /nick opennnnnnn
16:50 +open`: I'm happy with the results I've gotten, thanks for your time&help :)
16:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v supercosmonaut]
16:53 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
16:58 +billnye: open`: yeah, turn off shrinking I'd say
16:58 +billnye: open`: but now that you know how to adjust your gtrans script, you can adapt
16:58 +open`: I've turned shrink off
16:59 +open`: yep... I'm in disbelief, I didn't mess with the wrong stuff. it worked like a charm on the first try! I'm pretty happy with myself right now :] thanks
16:59 +billnye: hehe
16:59 +billnye: bien hecho
17:00 +open`: gracias. Ahora puedo hablar español con la ayuda de esta herramienta, a pesar de no saber más de 2 o 3 palabras de la misma
17:01 +open`: Voin puhua myös suomeksi, tai millä tahansa muulla kielellä että asia!
17:01 +open`: Okay, I'll stop fooling around now :) I like this script very much
17:03 +x00malachi: hehe ..thats pretty good. Is that script on the Irssi website ?
17:13 +billnye: open`: I got the gist of the spanish just fine (minus the aforementioned 2 or 3 words, perhaps ;D ) but the moonspeak is beyond me
17:13 +billnye: x00malachi: gtrans
17:13 +billnye: http://scripts.irssi.org/
17:14 +open`: the moonspeak was actually finnish :)
17:14 +billnye: open`: usually is
17:14 +open`: haha :)
17:15 +billnye: open`: I could've googletranslated it, but I didn't bother
17:15 +open`: yeah, because now you can gtrans it!
17:17 +lilibox: test
17:17 +lilibox: one more time
17:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ryzer]
17:17 +lilibox: nice
17:18 +open`: are you trying out the script?
17:18 +billnye: open`: no, I didn't load the script :P
17:18 +open`: hm ok :)
17:18 +lilibox: i tried right nick alligment
17:18 +open`: ah, ok. yeah, now I can't live with the right alignment - it helps with a readability soooo much
17:19 +lilibox: maybe would be nice to add possibility to hide nick modes
17:20 +billnye: why hide?
17:20 +lilibox: i piss off to know someone as @ ;) jk
17:20 +billnye: hehe
17:20 +lilibox: well, maybe it will look more clearly
17:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v ikonia]
17:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
17:21 +open`: I'm not certain if this is a feature that nm.pl offers, or it's built in natively into irssi - but you can choose to not have it show quits/parts, and that makes the screen look a lot more readable, nice (example screenshot: http://sysphere.org/gallery/albums/snapshots/awesome.png )
17:23 +ArmOrAttAk: he left open`
17:24 +catsup: i've got a command to remove them from an existing buffer

17:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v openess]
17:25 +catsup: but uh, yeah, you can just use /ignore to ignore join/parts/users
17:25 +catsup: etc

17:28 +catsup: http://jerkface.net/software/irssi/rignore.pl <-- retroactive ignore
17:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v tmr]
17:32 +open`: that's very interesting... changing the existing buffer
17:32 +open`: I didn't think that would have been very easy or possible
17:33 +open`: does it also expunge the mode lines? (someone hsa been set +v by chanserv, things like that)
17:33 +catsup: yes
17:33 +open`: fantastic, sold
17:33 +open`: thanks :)
17:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SNow]
17:33 +catsup: it ignores based on regex in the buffer
17:34 +catsup: or based on a glob
17:34 +catsup: see the source, there are various commands.  /crapbust won't work for you unless you edit it though
17:34 +catsup: because the regex won't match your non-standard buffers
17:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v SolarisB1y]
17:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v lagagnon]
17:37 +catsup: what would be really cool is if you had the nicks in the buffer indicate whether the users had parted
