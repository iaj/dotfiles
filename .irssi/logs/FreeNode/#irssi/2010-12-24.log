00:33 +dtm: hi all.  when I shut down irssi, i'd like it to have automatically remembered everything without me having to type '/layout save' and whatever else.  and when i start irssi, i'd like it to rejoin all of the remembered channels.  as it stands, i have to manually do '/join' on each one.
00:34 +msparks: dtm: /help network, /help server, /help channel
00:34 +martin: dtm: use /server and /network to set up the networks and servers you connect to, then /channel to add ...
00:34 +martin: what msparks said
00:35 +dtm: okay
00:37 +dtm: so i have to add a network, and then add a server to that network?
00:38 +martin: yeah
00:39 +tmr: http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c3 might help.
00:40 +dtm: so '/layout save' is only which windows are open, in which order?  and i still have to do '/channel' to join them.
00:41 +dtm: i see.  well thanks guys.
00:41 +tmr: There is a script to automate channel saving.

02:02 +iaj: lo there
02:03 +iaj: does anyone use any script for opening urls easily?
02:03 +mauke: I do, but it runs in my terminal
02:03 +vague`: I do, but it's a script for my terminal.
02:03 +vague`: Probably what mauke also meant :P
02:06 +vague`: If you use rxvt, http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog/urxvt-url-yank
02:07 +mauke: that looks like the broken one
02:08 +mauke: my version is http://mauke.ath.cx/stuff/urxvt/mark-yank-urls
02:08 +vague`: What is broken in my version?
02:08 +vague`: Well, I know one thing but might not be what you are referring to :)

02:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v vincent_wang]
02:13 +mauke: I don't even remember most of what I changed
02:13 +mauke: one thing was the global variables
02:13 +vague`: Does it escape ()& in urls?
02:14 +mauke: I don't think so
02:15 +mauke: should it?
02:15 +mauke: hmm, I should really change the default pattern
02:16 +vague`: Probably shouldn't, but it should :P
02:17 +vague`: I hate it if I get a url with POST data and try to wget it, and forget to escape the & between variables
02:18 +mauke: http://mauke.ath.cx/stuff/urxvt/mark-yank-urls - now with harder regexery
02:19 +vague`: I tried to modify mark-yank-url to escape urls but somehow it remembers the length of the url, and if I escape ()&, as many characters are dropped at the end of the url
02:19 +mauke: vague`: that also affects ;'*?{}[] and a few other things
02:20 +mauke: in my version you'd have to change do_copy

11:15 +Bazerka: VSpike: those errors tend to suggest you've manually edited your config file and have introduced syntax errors

11:19 +tmr: Easy enough to fix though, just remove your config and start from beginning editing only with internal commands.

11:41 +Bazerka: VSpike: you've put it in the wrong items sections

11:41 +Bazerka: formats go into the outer statusbar items section (ie, the top bit)
11:42 +Bazerka: ie, where window, window_empty, prompt, prompt_empty etc are
11:43 +Bazerka: the items in the lower blocks signify actual statusbar items and only have priority/alignment attributes
