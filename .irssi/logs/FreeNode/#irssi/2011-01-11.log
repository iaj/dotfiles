10:15 +vague`: /window item move #
10:16 +vague`: Err, actually, that wont merge, just move the bar to the window foo, but not the chat that has been.
10:17 +vague`: Should preferably be done at the moment the user joins again
10:17 +iceroot: not always possible
10:17 +vague`: You can do /lastlog -window , see /help lastlog
10:17 +iceroot: so i need a way to correct it after the user was chatting with me
10:19 +iceroot: also i dont thing lastlog is the method i want, i need something like a real merge. e.g. foo is chatting at 01:00, bar at 02:00, foo at 03:00 and the merge will show me all in the correct order in one window
10:21 +vague`: Fix the logs when done chatting. cat log1 log2 log3 | sort > log_totti or similar
10:23 +iceroot: vague`: so you mean create a temp-file with the text and then pasting the textfile into a chat-window?

22:20 +Russia: How can I get the modules Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum, Crypt::DH and Crypt::Blowfish for irssi?
22:20 +mauke: check if your distribution has packages for them
22:20 +mauke: otherwise install with cpan
22:20 +shabble: or use the 'cpan -i <name>'
22:21 +mauke: useless use of -i
22:21 +shabble: is it?
22:21 * shabble checks
22:21 +shabble: handy
22:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v canyouscore]
22:23 +Russia: Does anyone know if ubuntu has packages for them?
22:24 +shabble: apt-cache search openssl | grep perl should tell you
22:24 +Russia: ok
22:24 +Bazerka: crypt would probably be a better search term
22:24 +shabble: rue
22:25 * shabble prods his t key a bit harder
22:30 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v furry]
22:31 +furry: Er, in irssi, after installing cap_sasl.pl and using /sasl set network username password mechanism, is there anything else I need to do to connect thru tur?
22:31 +furry: *tor
22:32 +share: furry: connect to hidden service
22:32 --- xindz is now known as xindz-off
22:32 +share: furry: p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion
22:32 +share: furry: and set up proxy to use 127.0.0.1 and port 9050
22:33 +share: socks5
22:33 +furry: Uh, what commands would I need to do to do so?
22:34 +share: furry: r u using linux?
22:34 +share: and irssi?
22:34 +furry: Yeah...
22:34 +share: furry: so forget what i said :x
22:34 +share: wait
22:34 +furry: Er... What WOULD i need to do, then?
22:35 +share: furry: open a terminal and type socat TCP4-LISTEN:2222,fork SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion:6667,socksport=9050
22:35 +share: then with irssi connect to 127.0.0.1 aka localhost .. port 2222
22:35 +share: furry: you need socat
22:36 +furry: apt-get install socat?
22:36 +share: ye
22:37 +furry: using socat TCP4-LISTEN:2222,fork SOCKS4A:127.0.0.1:p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion:6667,socksport=9050 won't mess up any of my other connections, right?
22:37 +share: no
22:37 +furry: Ok
22:38 +share: just dont use port 2222 in any other programs
22:38 +share: you can change the port too..
22:38 +share: it's just easy to memorize
22:38 +furry: I've done that, then would I just set the server to 127.0.0.1 and port 2222, as opposed to chat.us.freenode.net and port 6667?
22:39 +share: furry: you cant choose the freenode server when connectin with tor
22:39 +share: you just connect to hidden service
22:39 +share: which is p4fsi4ockecnea7l.onion
22:40 +furry: would I use /connect?
22:40 +share: furry: /connect localhost 2222
22:40 +furry: ok
22:40 +share: with sasl settings ready
22:40 +share: use dh blowfish
22:40 +share: instrad of plain
22:40 +share: *instead
22:41 +furry: so, /sasl set localhost username password blowfish
22:41 +furry: then /connect localhost 2222
22:41 +share: furry: i added a server to irssi tor-freenode
22:42 +share: but try that
22:42 +share: like /sasl set tor-freenode share password DH-BLOWFISH
22:44 +furry: would I need to do a /network add -auto tor-freenode first?
22:44 +share: ye
22:44 +share: sec
22:45 +tmr: Is there #irssi in tor-freenode like there is in freenode?
22:45 +share: lol
22:45 +cromag: there is a freenode for tor only now ?
22:45 +share: no..lol
22:45 +cromag: haha phew
22:45 +cromag: i was like wtf?!
22:46 +furry: Er.
22:46 +tmr: So why tor-freenode instead of freenode?
22:46 +cromag: for tor'ing
22:46 +share: ye
22:46 +cromag: just a name i guess
22:46 +share: ye
22:46 +tmr: You like to keep different settings when "tor'ing"?
22:46 +mauke: .oO( tor-rent )
22:47 +share: tmr: furry wants help not me
22:47 * cromag farts
22:47 +tmr: mauke, no, that would be pr0n'ing.
22:47 +cromag: prewning
22:47 +furry: Er, how does /network add and /server add work, again?
22:48 +cromag: you can put multiple servers in "network"
22:48 +cromag: it's like a folder for your servers.
22:48 +share: ye
22:48 +cromag: you call one network Freenode, and you can put irc.freenode.net and another freenode server in that
22:48 +furry: But what's the order for the parameters?
22:48 +cromag: the "network" part is just a name
22:49 +mauke: furry: /help help
22:49 +cromag: /help networ
22:49 +cromag: /help network
22:49 +cromag: and /help server
22:50 +cromag: i could call my network for freenode 'FN' and add irc.freenode.net in that
22:51 +share: viddy got pwned
22:51 +mauke: /upgradizzled
