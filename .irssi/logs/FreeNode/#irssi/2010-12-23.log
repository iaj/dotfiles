00:27 +Bazerka: mauke: the kick informs him of how to get the ban removed

11:39 +black: Hey, I'm having some problems getting IRSSI to connect to freenode properly. I'm trying to get it to auto-identify me when I connect to the network, so that I can auto-join channesl that require identification.
11:39 +black: What I'm currently doing, is:
11:40 +black: `/network add -autosendcmd "/msg nickserv identify xxx" FREENODE`
11:40 +black: But that doesn't seem to work.
11:40 +black: When I restart IRSSI, it still doesn't identify me.
11:40 +black: What am I missing? Is there some special syntax I can use inside of the `autosendcmd` param to make it wait or something?
11:41 +Death4Life:  -autosendcmd "command 1; wait 1000; command2; ..."
11:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v pierpier]
11:41 +Death4Life: and
11:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v janhouse]
11:42 +Death4Life: you can use account:password as server password, that will get passed to nickserv
11:42 +black: oO

11:48 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fox20052]
11:48 +black: Death4Life: so using account:pass in my SERVER seemed to work well enough (now I am identified), but it looks like it still won't do what I have listed in my autosend cmd on my network.
11:48 +black: My autosendcmd option now looks like: "wait 2000; /msg black test; wait 2000" <-- could I be doing something wrong?
11:48 +black: I'm just trying to get it to at least message me or something, so that I can verify it is working.
11:49 +nisshh: black, when i do /network mine looks like this:
11:49 +nisshh: Freenode: autosendcmd: /msg nickserv identify mypassword;wait 5000
11:50 +black: And then you're able to autojoin all of your channels that require identification? :o
11:50 +xand: why would you use autosendcmd for nickserv? just use server password like black
11:51 +black: Well, my issue is that it doesn't look like my autosendcmd option is being used at all.
11:51 +nisshh: xand, i dont think using the server password is the recommended way of doing it
11:51 +black: I'm using irssi 0.8.15 (on ubutnu 10.10), but it just doesn't seem to be doing *anything*
11:51 +black: =/
11:52 +black: Even if my autosendcmd is "/msg black test;wait 5000"
11:52 +nisshh: black, one sec, ill find the way i did it, i cant remember :)
11:52 +black: I get no messages on here.
11:52 +tmr: How do you connect?
11:52 +black: To connect, I have the following:
11:53 +black: `NETWORK: FREENODE: nick: b14ck, autosendcmd: /msg black hi there; wait 5000`
11:53 +black: `SERVER:  chat.freenode.net 7000 (pass), autoconnect, ssl`
11:53 +black: `CHANNEL: #django FREENODE autojoin`
11:53 +black: That's it.
11:54 +nisshh: black, its irc.freenode.net not chat.freenode.net :)
11:54 +xand: nisshh: yes it is
11:54 +black: http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml
11:54 +tmr: From where did you copy that SERVER bit?
11:54 +nisshh: oh i see, either can be used
11:54 +black: Yah, I'm just using the ones on freenode's website.
11:54 +black: I can connect to freenode just fine, and it auths me to nickserv.
11:54 +tmr: nisshh, irc.freenode.net is an alias for chat.freenode.net.
11:54 +black: But it won't autojoin my channel.
11:55 +xand: nisshh: and it's recommended to use accountname:password
11:55 +nisshh: tmr, yeah, i didnt realise :)
11:55 +black: (or message me, for tha tmatter)
11:55 +FernandoBasso: If I /ignore *+v* will Irssi ignore only from the channel I issued the command from?
11:55 +nisshh: xand, maybe by freenode, but the irssi docs are what i go by
11:55 +xand: nisshh: they're wrong for freenode
11:56 +nisshh: xand, yeah, whatever dude, i dont really care
11:56 +tmr: FernandoBasso, no.
11:57 +tmr: black, a) how do you connect.
11:57 +black: tmr: automatically
11:57 +tmr: black, b) what does '/server list' say about that server?
11:58 +black: server list says: "chat.freenode.net    7000             (pass), autoconnect, ssl,
11:58 +black:       ssl_verify, ssl_capath: /etc/ssl/certs"
11:58 +black: (which works)
11:58 +tmr: So that server is not tied to freenode network.
11:58 +black: It isn't? :o
11:58 +FernandoBasso: tmr: But if I do like /ignore * joins that * says 'all channels. Where am I saying 'all channels' in /ignore *+v* ?
11:58 +tmr: Thus network specific autosendcmd is not ran.
11:58 +black: Oh shit! You're right.
11:58 +tmr: FernandoBasso, all channels is default.
11:59 +black: I guess I forgot the -network option when I was remaking the server again.
11:59 +black: :o
11:59 +tmr: black, yeah.
11:59 +black: d'o!
11:59 +FernandoBasso: tmr: So, if I do /ignore JOINS it is like /ignore * JOINS ?
11:59 +tmr: FernandoBasso, actually you're saying all channels yourself, '*'.
11:59 +FernandoBasso: tmr: Okay. Thanks.
11:59 +tmr: FernandoBasso, that would ignore nick JOINS.
12:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v fox20052]
12:00 +FernandoBasso:  /ignore *+v* just didn't work.

13:52 +Bazerka: that depends what's easiest
13:52 +Bazerka: you could do ALL -JOINS, or all the levels bar JOINS
13:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Smiley__1]
13:52 +Bazerka: (eg)
13:52 +FernandoBasso: But ALL will not add all levels?
13:53 +FernandoBasso: Or just the ones the window already has?
13:53 +Bazerka: when you set levels, if you don't specify any modifiers, you will replace whatever levels are there already
13:54 --- Smiley__1 is now known as Smiley
13:54 +FernandoBasso: Bazerka: And with modifiers, Irssi keeps the ones that are already set, and just appends or removes the ones supplied with - or + ?
13:55 +Bazerka: hmm, I think I've explained it badly
13:57 +FernandoBasso: I have a window with about 12 levels. I want to keep those 12 leves, and add two more. I need to retype those 12 levels plus the new two?
13:57 +Bazerka: no
13:58 +Bazerka: when you're talking about /window level , then the + and - do what you expect
13:58 +Bazerka: they add/remove from existing levels
13:58 +Bazerka: eg, if you create a new window that has ALL, if you then -JOINS, you'll see it'll switch from ALL to every level except JOINS
13:59 +FernandoBasso: Bazerka: Okay. Thanks. I understand now.
13:59 +Bazerka: you can then +JOINS and it'll go back to ALL
13:59 +FernandoBasso: So, it is very easier than I though.
13:59 +FernandoBasso: /very/much/
14:00 +Bazerka:  when you're dealing with level settings (eg, /set autolog_level) then + doesn't mean anything and - is only a modifier to ALL
14:00 +Bazerka: because whatever you /set replaces the existing setting value
14:01 +FernandoBasso: I was confused because I do liek /join -oftc OpenBox, where - in this case has a different meaning.
14:05 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nomad_fr]
14:07 +FernandoBasso: Bazerka: I read he help a long time ago (two years I think). Are these details in  the help?
14:09 +Bazerka: with regards to commands, - means an option
14:09 +Bazerka: rather than minus
14:10 +Bazerka: ie, commands are /<command> [subcommand] [-options] [arguments]
14:11 +Bazerka: they're all listed (or should be) in the /help for each command
14:11 +tmr: And sometimes options to arguments.
14:11 +Bazerka: tmr: no
14:11 +Bazerka: options always come before arguments
14:12 +deepy: What about options with arguments?
14:12 +tmr: Might remember wrong too, don't care enough to check.
14:12 +Bazerka: those are options with values
14:12 +Bazerka:  eg, /ignore -channels [value] [arguments]
14:12 +Bazerka: er
14:13 +Bazerka:  eg, /ignore -channels <value> [arguments]
14:13 +Bazerka: an option doesn't have any arguments, just a value
14:14 +Bazerka: as all options really are are key value pairs
14:15 +Bazerka: -tags are the exception to that however :)
14:16 +Bazerka: I think it was a mistake having -<tag>, but that decision was made long ago

18:36 +Godslastering: is there a good "autojoin" script that allows me to easily add/remove autojoin channels from it?
18:43 +billnye: seems to me that if you want easily add/remove, you have the /channel command (possibly with a blanket /addallchannels at the start)... if you want "autojoin what I had connected last time" that's the territory of the scripts I've seen
18:45 +Godslastering: billnye: and /channel command will auto-join those when i connect to that server?
18:45 +billnye: if you tell it that's what you want, yes it will
18:46 +Godslastering: billnye: sorry for my ignorance but how do i tell it to do this?

22:07 +harleypig: I had my autolog_path set to .irssi/logs/$tag_$0_%F.log and that seemed to be creating log files ok (after toggling autolog per tmr). I want to separate log files by network so I changed autolog_path to .irssi/logs/$chatnet_$tag_$0_%F.log and toggled autolog and irssi appears to still be writing to the first filename.  Any pointers?
22:09 +harleypig: If $chatnet wasn't set or something then the log files should at least be starting with '_' but they aren't.
22:11 +harleypig: hmmm ... maybe it wasn't working as correctly as I thought ... the file name being created (e.g., for this channel) is #irssi_2010-12-23.log ... but I'm not sure if '#irssi' is $tag or $0 ... in either case the filename doesn't match the pattern.
22:13 +tmr: harleypig, $tag is server tag, $0 channel.
22:14 +harleypig: Ah.  So, $tag isn't being used in the filename then.
22:15 +harleypig: Could this be a problem like with perl? if I were to use $var = "$tag_$0_" it would be looking for a variable name 'tag_' ...
22:16 +tmr: Try ${tag}_etc..
