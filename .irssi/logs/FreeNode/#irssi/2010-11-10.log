13:16 +Iceland_jack: Is it possible to see whether there are any unchecked hilighted messages?
13:17 +Iceland_jack: I created a script that checks for hilighted messages and prints them shortly in GNU screen, but I want some kind of an indicator showing that there are still unchecked messages
13:18 +Zmx: how do you "check" hilite ?
13:19 +jink: /lastlog -hilight  ?
13:19 +Iceland_jack: A modified version of the notify.pl script

13:22 +Zmx: Iceland_jack: this seems to send hilite with notify-send. How dit you check a hilite is checked or not ?
13:23 +Iceland_jack: Zmx: Like I said, I modified it.
13:23 +Iceland_jack: I do not use "notify-send"
13:23 +Iceland_jack: That's not the problem really
13:25 +Zmx: Iceland_jack: This is really the problem. This script (modified or not) only execute a call when an event occur.
13:25 +Iceland_jack: The script works perfectly so far

13:34 +shuaib: works like a charm in Vim
13:34 +Zmx: shuaib: for mouse you need a script AFAIK
13:34 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v `ightfrog]
13:34 +shuaib: Zmx: and for page up/down?

13:35 +shuaib: Zmx: anyway I can make it to just pgup>
13:35 +shuaib: ?

14:46 +billnye: if shift+pgup works, it's still a terminal issue not an irssi one yes?
14:46 +billnye: (in the mac instance)
14:49 +Nei: maybe maybe not
14:49 +Nei: well it is not directly a irssi issue in any case
14:51 +billnye: Nei: yours is the general solution, but I know mac terminals have weird ideas of what to do with pgup/dn specifically
14:51 +billnye: I'm not, however, familiar enough to be sure shuaib is still in that twilight zone
14:51 +billnye: but the yes vim no irssi sounds a bit like it
14:53 +jnpplf: PgUp in Terminal goes to the Terminal app itself, not to its contents
14:53 +jnpplf: i.e. it scrolls up in the terminal window
14:53 +Nei: well he says his works in vim, thats the strange point. but maybe some confusion out there
14:53 * jnpplf shuts up
15:03 +billnye: Nei: IIRC vim "grabs control" of the terminal a little more than irssi does
15:03 +ds187: the force is with vim
15:03 +billnye: i.e. the signal for scrolling the term might work in vim, but it /definitely/ doesn't work in irssi
15:04 +billnye: well it sometimes kinda sorta works in irssi

17:30 +WOFall: or if that's even what i should be trying
17:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v marienz]
17:34 +Zed`: WOFall: the resize is prolly a function of your terminal if /redraw does not work
17:38 +Zed`: take a look at /help hilight too
17:39 +Zed`: bitlbee should not be hilighting you unless you are doing somthing like 'account list'
17:39 +WOFall: hum, seems you're right about the terminal
17:40 +WOFall: One of my accounts is wofall@whereever.com so it hilights me on connect. also i prolly have some hilight script
17:41 +WOFall: well for the -channels matching for a hilight, can i do something like [all except &bitlbee]?
17:43 +Zed`: prolly with regex but I am not sure how
17:43 +Zed`: I would hang someone wll have a suggestion
17:43 +Zed`: you could ignore modes in $bitlbee
17:43 +Zed`: err &bitlbee
