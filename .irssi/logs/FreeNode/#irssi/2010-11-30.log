13:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v nhandler]
13:43 +nhandler: When I launch irssi, I need to hit Ctrl+X in my status window a few times to get to 'freenode'. Is there anyway to avoid this?
13:44 +ruskie: reduce the ammount of networks?
13:44 +xand: nhandler: why do you need to change to freenode?
13:45 +nhandler: xand: Particularly so some commands that I send to the server from the status window go to the right place. Currently, it goes to oftc by default. I want to change that default setting to freenode
13:45 +xand: what commands?
13:47 +xand: maybe you can automate them or put them in settings instead
13:47 +tmr: Or just tell to command what network you need.
13:47 +xand: yes
13:49 +nhandler: One example would be something like /oper . I can't really automate that (for security reasons). I run that from the status window, and it is a pain having to remember to hit Ctrl+X a few times before running the command
13:50 +tmr: /tag alias might be helpful.
13:54 +tmr: http://wouter.coekaerts.be/site/irssi/aliases
13:54 +Remco: http://download.remcol.ath.cx/change_server.pl.txt

13:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v thoas]
14:02 +Remco: nhandler: I'd like a setting for a default server in the status window too, for pretty much the same reason
14:03 +nhandler: Remco: I might have to take a look at the irssi source code later to figure out how it gets the default server for the status window. It might be as simple as simply taking the first or last network listed in the config
14:03 +Remco: It changes to the server on connect
14:04 +Remco: So the last one to connect will remain, and if a server times out and reconnects it's changed to that
14:04 +Remco: Quite annoying really

14:17 +visof: jink: thanks that's working now , but can i add the log of previous channel or private chat to that log of opened now ?
14:17 +sloth: hey i am trying to use the regex ^sloth(?!icus).*$
14:17 +sloth: which is a valid regex
14:18 +sloth: but irssi says its derps
14:18 +sloth: which is lies
14:18 +sloth: wassamatter it?
14:18 +Flyoc: the negative lookahead missa
14:18 +jink: That probably answers my old question, too:  Can I somehow make /lastlog -regexp work with negative look-aheads?  (?!..) doesn't seem to work for me. :/
14:18 +Flyoc: irssi's regexp engine not issa support it
14:18 +jink: Flyoc: Submit a patch! :D
14:19 +Flyoc: jink: I chose to choose a "unique" nickname :)
14:19 +sloth: srsly?
14:19 +sloth: that is kinda gay
14:19 +sloth: is there any fix for that?
14:20 +jink: Flyoc: I was looking for urls, but wanted to avoid common ones, like links to the docs.
14:21 +Flyoc: sloth: does [^i] work ?

14:23 +Flyoc: :)
14:23 +Flyoc: it's equivalent but not strictly the same, but I guess it should do
14:26 +sloth: Flyoc: yeah i changed it to [^(icus)] and that works a treat
14:31 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v jaminja]
14:32 +jink: sloth: That's wrong.
14:33 +sloth: jink: i agree
14:33 +sloth: #regex is helping me with the regex
14:33 +jink: If you agree, just stick with the [^i] :)
14:36 +peth: how about /lastlog -word ?
14:37 +jink: peth: Sloth's issue is about /hilight
14:38 +peth: oh, i did that mix that up. sorry.
14:38 +sloth: i just used ^sloth([^(\Qic.us*\E)].*|\Qic.us\E*.+|.{0,4})$
14:38 +sloth: which has done the job

16:02 +jink: You should put the script in ~/.irssi/scripts/ and put a symlink to it in autorun.

17:36 +billnye: no, why would I do that :)
17:36 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v joneal]
17:36 +Nei: because you always used to when still using bitchx...
17:37 +Nei: besides it can save you some chars on average
17:41 +Syniq: Nei: Srsly, though, I wish it would prioritise the last person I spoke to in a specific channel.
17:42 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]

17:43 +MojoWork: so i have a server entry with the password stored
17:43 +MojoWork: i made it with irssi shut down by editing the config file by hand
17:43 +MojoWork: how do i change the password with irssi up?
17:43 +Nei: "add" the server again doesnt work?
17:44 +MojoWork: haven't tried because i don't know how to add a server at all ;)
17:45 +MojoWork: since i did it by hand before
17:45 +billnye: MojoWork: /help server
17:45 +billnye: and "ADD" = "ADD_OR_CHANGE"
17:45 +MojoWork: thanks
17:46 +Nei: sort of strange that you cant have a password for a network, huh
17:46 +grawity: "Server passwords" originally were a server-specific thing
17:46 +MojoWork: it's jabber
17:46 +MojoWork: i'm using the irssi-xmpp-plugin

17:47 +MojoWork: where's "chatnet" in there?
17:47 +Nei: you could argument that nicks and users are server specific
17:47 +Nei: has been renamed to -network and not been updated everywhere......
17:47 +MojoWork: ah thanks
17:48 +MojoWork: one last thing, now that i've changed it, how do i force the config to be rewritten w/o quitting?
17:49 +Nei: that would be /save
17:49 +MojoWork: heh
17:49 +Nei: if you're ever bored, go through /help and see if theres any cool stuff you missed :P

21:24 +MinceR: iirc they represent fractions of a second differently
21:24 +KBme: it does use unix time
21:24 +MinceR: and since only the sender needs to understand the reply (which should be the exact same data as it sent) there's no problem
21:24 +KBme: but KVirc time: 1291148250.9787; irssi time: 1291148250 9787
21:25 +KBme: no, the reply should be the other client's unix time
21:25 +MinceR: who said that?
21:25 +KBme: actually, it's unix time /100 with last four digits in decimal
21:25 +KBme: said the clients who calculate the lag based on that
21:25 +KBme: even irssi does that, i don't understand the surprise
21:26 +MinceR: no need for the other client to send its own time to calculate lag
21:26 +KBme: i thought i had to reply the message text too, but no
21:26 +MinceR: it sends its own, gets it back, subtracts it from current time at time of receipt

21:48 +Keba: hi there
21:48 +Janon: hello
21:48 --- Channel #irssi was synced in 134 seconds
21:49 +Keba: http://scripts.irssi.org/ says scripts in .irssi/scripts/autorun are loaded automatically, that does not work here (ubuntu 10.04, irssi 0.8.14): they are not loaded
21:49 +Keba: as the site suggest, i used symlinks
21:50 +Remco: You did restart?
21:50 +znx: Keba: it doesnt load the moment you put them in there .. it autoload *on start*
21:51 +Keba: znx: sure. i restarted irssi to test this
21:52 +znx: Keba: the only thing that strikes me is that your symlinks are broken
21:52 +Remco: Or perl is not loaded
21:52 +Remco: Or somehow the default script dir was changed
21:52 +znx: indeed that a good one Remco
21:53 +Keba: znx: oh, there are
21:53 +Keba: Remco: the scricpts work, if i load them manually
21:54 +znx: "they are" ?
21:54 +Remco: Also if you use /script load autorun/script.pl ?
21:54 +billnye: Keba: that tells us perl is intact, but not muc helse
21:54 +billnye: hee "much else"*
21:55 +Keba: znx: they are broken, yes
21:55 +znx: ah :)
21:55 +znx: good guess on my part
21:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Janon_]
21:55 +znx: Keba: there is a neat script called "scriptassist.pl" .. you can do:  /scriptassist autorun someotherscript
21:55 +znx: and it makes the symlinks for you .. whilst inside irssi ;D!
21:56 +Keba: znx: i know, but my symlinks should work. i do "ln -s tinyurl.pl autorun/" (while beeing in ~/.irssi/scripts/), and the symlink is broken…
21:57 +Keba: too many "Too many levels of symbolic links"
21:58 +Remco: cd autorun; ln -s -T ../tinyurl.pl tinyurl.pl
21:58 +billnye: Keba: no, from autorun you ln -s ../tinyurl.pl ---yeah
21:58 * Remco likes the explicit -T
21:58 +Keba: billnye: isn’t that the same?
21:58 +billnye: no.
21:58 +Keba: aport from the -T

22:06 +billnye: Keba: just as if you were in the dir, the link needs to be relative to the target dir
22:07 +billnye: Keba: it'd still be "ln -s ../tinyurl.pl autorun/"
22:07 --- Janon_ is now known as Janon
22:07 +billnye: (it was easy to answer "no" because it WASN'T behaving the same... figuring out why took a sec :D
22:08 +Keba: billnye: ah ok
22:08 +Keba: confusing
22:09 +billnye: I think maybe the benefit is that that syntax supports multiple targets
22:10 +Keba: hm? ln -s ../foo.pl autorun/ /usr/share/irssi/scripts/autorun/ would have failed?
