10:13 +jink: See topic about ssl on freenode?
10:18 +tmr: Gryllida, yeah that's the bug. In that case irss will try to reconnect without ssl, which obviously fails when server expects ssl.

21:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v craiggles]
21:00 +Ziber: its not shown on message lines, though. my theme, i guess, shows its on joins/modes/parts/quit, etc
21:00 +Ziber: but not messages, actions, etc.
21:03 +Ziber: and i dont want it shown with what im printing.
21:04 +Ziber: anyway to avoid that with channel::printformat?

21:05 +vague`: How to circumvent it, I don't know for sure.

21:32 +Remco: Command: $window->printformat(MSGLEVEL_SNOTES, 'connect', $sname, $1, $2, $3, $4); Format: Irssi::theme_register(['connect', '{server $0}[%BConnect%n] {nick $2} {nickhost $3} on port $1, type $4']);
21:33 +Remco: It probably depends on the level you give it, but I don't tinker with the script much
21:33 +bamccaig_: OH, there we go. /script exec Irssi::print('foo', MSGLEVEL_SNOTES) prints just '<time> <message>' for me.
21:34 +plm: how I do to automatic save all conversations?
21:34 +Remco: plm: http://irssi.org/documentation/startup#c8
21:35 +plm: Remco: I read that, but I would like a config method because I don't wnat everythink I enter on irc set save log see?
21:36 +Ziber: Sigh. But MSGLEVEL_SNOTES would go to the status window, not the channel that it was triggered in.
21:37 +Remco: Not if you use $window->printformat
21:37 +Remco: Or perhaps even window::print
21:38 +plm: Remco: are there a file to configure that..? I see in .irssi a config file
21:39 +Remco: plm: You can change the levels that are logged
21:39 +Remco: Or you can use what you learn from /help log
21:39 +plm: ok

21:48 +bamccaig_: Is it supposed to be a string? :\ I didn't think it was...

21:49 +Ziber: Huh.
21:49 +Ziber: Lets see.
21:52 +Ziber: Rawr.
21:52 +Ziber: Yes, you're right. Its not a string, its a constant. And now it works exactly as it should.

22:13 +creichen: Hi!  I'm having a mysterious issue with the `proxy' plugin.  On one of my machines this plugin works perfectly, but on the one I need it it doesn't (with the same settings).  Is anyone here familiar with that module?
22:15 +Bazerka: the working machine is linux and the non-working machine is *BSD?
22:16 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip_]
22:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v yuri__]
22:18 +creichen: Bazerka: both are Linux.  The working one is amd64, the non-working one ia32/x86.  The non-working one had some amount of hardening done on it in the past, but I don't think that's responsible here.
22:19 +Bazerka: ah k
22:19 +creichen: Loading the module works fine, but I can't connect to the specified port on the non-working machine, even though net_listen() successfully returns during setup.
22:19 +creichen: (playing around with the same ports using e.g. netcat works fine).
22:19 +Bazerka: does the port show in netstat -l ?
22:19 +creichen: No.
22:20 +Bazerka: so it doesn't successfully bind
22:20 +Bazerka: sounds very much like a hardening policy issue
22:20 +mow: how do you get the pipe to work in  =>  /exec -o tail -f ~/.irssi/logs/blah/blah  | grep blah
22:20 +creichen: Bazerka: but wouldn't netcat fail on the same port, then, too?
22:21 +Bazerka: creichen: pass, I have no experience with Linux hardening systems (I'm a BSD user)
22:22 +creichen: Okay.  Thanks anyway. :-)
22:22 +Bazerka: but if you suspect it is not, one thing I can suggest you try is that you specify a bind address
22:23 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v yuri__]
22:23 +Bazerka: wild shot in the dark, but the BSDs behave the same if you don't specify the bind address
22:23 +Bazerka: it reports no errors, but the socket doesn't get bound
22:23 +creichen: Ah, I hadn't tried that.  Trying that beats dissecting glib, so I'll give it a shot.
22:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip]
22:32 +bamccaig_: mow: It should work just like that, I think..
22:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v alip_]
22:32 +bamccaig_: /bin/sh: rot13: command not found
22:32 +bamccaig_: sbb
22:32 +bamccaig_: Errm. >_< But yes, it works. :P
22:32 +mow: bamccaig_: it won't, I've qouted every way I can think. works fine without the pipe
22:33 +mow: bamccaig_: it works for you?
22:34 +bamccaig_: cat ~/src/todo/todo | grep warnings
22:34 +bamccaig_: use warnings;
22:34 +bamccaig_: ^ That works fine for me.
22:35 +bamccaig_: exec - -out cat ~/src/todo/todo | grep warnings
22:35 +bamccaig_: Or, /exec, rather.
22:35 +Ziber: what would you all suggest as the best way to count the number of items in a window?
22:35 +bamccaig_: print Dumper $window ;)
22:35 +mow: try with tail and the -f switch
22:36 +tmr: Poor cat.
22:37 +mow: bamccaig_: yes that works fine, but tail -f is causing the problem
22:37 +mow: can it be done
22:37 +bamccaig_: Yes, I see that now.
22:37 +mow: without the pipe tail -f works
22:37 +bamccaig_: I wonder why though... o_O It's as if there's just no output (tail and grep appear to keep running, presumably blocked).
22:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Doa]
22:38 +mow: something I would guess with tail running in the back ground
22:41 +creichen: Bazerka:  your wild guess was spot-on.  Took me a while to test, but that resolved the issue.
22:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v r4]
22:41 +creichen: Thank you! :-)
22:41 +bamccaig_: Unless irssi is configuring the running environment strangely, I don't know... o-O
22:41 +Bazerka: creichen: oh, that's pleasing to hear :)
22:41 +Bazerka: if somewhat surprising
22:42 +creichen: But that would mean that the `proxy' plugin is broken on *BSD now...?
22:42 +Bazerka: I wouldn't say broken, no - it just requires additional configuration :)
22:42 +bamccaig_: mow: Hmm, related? http://cvs.silcnet.org/source/irssi/TODO#L472
22:43 * bamccaig_ is in Linux though.
22:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v CiRlE]
22:43 --- ChanServ sets modes [#irssi +v Vetinari]
22:43 +creichen: Bazerka: so there's a way to configure this without changing the sources?
22:44 +Bazerka: creichen: you modified the source to change your bind address?
22:44 +Bazerka: there's a setting for that :)
22:45 +creichen: Er.  Well, my way `worked', too... ;->
22:45 +Bazerka: irssiproxy_bind
22:45 +Bazerka: iirc
22:46 +mow: bamccaig_: maybe it is a problem then.... I thought I've done it before
22:46 +creichen: Yes, that seems to be working fine.
22:47 +creichen: Terrific!  Thanks again, Bazerka! :-)
22:47 +Bazerka: you're welcome :)
