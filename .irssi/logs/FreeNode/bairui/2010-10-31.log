23:45 --- Query: Starting query with bairui on FreeNode
23:45 iaj: hey mat
23:45 iaj: e
23:45 iaj: how are you?
23:45 iaj: everything alright?
23:46 iaj: am I disturbing on dinner?
23:46 bairui: g'day, mate. I'm good. How are you? I was afk for a while there this morning... missed a friend's IM :(
23:46 bairui: I just had breakfast - so, not disturbing dinner :)
23:47 iaj: hahaha.. oh. I forget your time all the time :-)
23:47 iaj: is it monday already?
23:47 iaj: must be.
23:47 iaj: :-)
23:47 bairui: it is indeed! :)
23:47 iaj: missed a friend's IM ?
23:47 iaj: What's IM?
23:47 iaj: Instant Message?
23:48 iaj: are your vimfiles shared somewhere on the web?
23:49 bairui: yeah - instant message - well, kinda - it was like this - a /query
23:49 bairui: my vimfiles are not shared... yet. I should get around to that one day...
23:50 iaj: heh...  may I ask - what plugins do you use for your everyday work mate?
23:51 bairui: surround, repeat, snipmate, vimoutliner - I have others, but don't *use* them, like NERDTree
23:51 iaj: what do you use for switchting buffers
23:52 iaj: and wahts vimoutliner used for
23:52 bairui: I use Vim's builtins - :ls and :b # / :b <partial>
23:52 bairui: vimoutliner is for well, outlining :)
23:52 bairui: I use it for a lot of things - making todo lists, taking notes, organising thoughts...
23:52 bairui: think of it as a text-only mind map
23:52 bairui: brb
23:53 iaj: so you recommen it?
23:53 iaj: I never heard of it
23:53 iaj: lemme give it a try ;-)
23:56 iaj: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=517
23:56 iaj: that one?
23:59 bairui: hmm... mine was (c) Steve Litt and Noel Henson... so, maybe that one is different? Maybe newer? Dunno... Been *ages* since I installed it - must need an upgrade by now. :p
23:59 bairui: Ask on #vim what the latest vimoutliner is - Raimondi should know 'cos he forked his own copy of it recently
