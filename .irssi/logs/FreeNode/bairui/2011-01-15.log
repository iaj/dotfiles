04:55 --- Query: Starting query with bairui on FreeNode

04:56 iaj: 5am.. on saturday
04:56 iaj: pitttttttty
04:56 bairui: too much coffee?
04:56 iaj: u?
04:56 iaj: maybe :( well I got to go work in 2 hrs anyawy
04:56 bairui: doing well
04:56 bairui: yuck - what's work?
04:56 bairui: i mean - what job do you have to go to?
04:57 iaj: creating a homepage
04:57 iaj: which needs to get done
04:57 iaj: oh well, its good paid so I'll bear it :)
04:57 bairui: ok. what... language/platform/etc?
04:57 bairui: fair enough
04:58 iaj: CMS Typo 3 System
04:58 iaj: :-)
04:58 bairui: nice
04:58 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/320843
04:58 iaj: could you take a look here mb?
04:58 bairui: sure - what am I looking for?
04:58 iaj: i want to enhance that oneI
04:58 iaj: eg.
04:59 iaj:     if (strlen(substr)==0)                          " nothing to match on empty string
04:59 iaj: at that part I want to look for am i placed     text is here [x]asssdf
04:59 iaj: at the first char of a word
04:59 iaj: = whitespace before
05:01 bairui: ok - i see... so, ignoring that code for a minute, what are you trying to do?
05:01 iaj: this is part of my tab function
05:02 bairui: ok
05:02 iaj: and I want it to just send a tab back
05:02 iaj: if theres a whitespace before the cursor
05:06 bairui: so... all you want to do it rewrite line 4?
05:06 bairui: this is an alternate way:   if substr =~ '^$'    but I don't know which way is faster...
05:07 bairui: so... did I misunderstand what you want?
05:07 iaj: hmm that might work :)   so i could just
05:08 iaj: if (strlen(substr)==0) | (substr=~
05:08 iaj: '^$')
05:08 iaj: but i don't think that's gonna work
05:08 iaj: because the substring actually consists of something
05:08 iaj: if this is a word and im placed [h]ere
05:09 iaj: i hit i there and im    'if this is a word and im placed []here
05:09 iaj: substr still is 'here' in this case
05:09 iaj: no?
05:10 bairui: dude, if     strlen(substr) == 0     then    substr =~ '^$'    is also true
05:11 bairui: strlen(substr) will return the length of the string. If that length is zero, then there is nothing in it. The regex /^$/ matches a zero-width string - that is, nothing.
05:11 iaj: lol ok :)
05:11 iaj: so i just wanna check here
05:12 iaj: if the position BEFORE the curosr
05:12 iaj: is a whitespace
05:13 bairui: so, you want to check if the character before the cursor is whitespace?
05:15 bairui: try: echo '#'.strpart(getline('.'), col('.')-2, 1).'#'
05:15 bairui: brb
05:17 bairui: back
