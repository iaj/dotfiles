03:48 bairui: iaj: I'd use   if getline('.')[col('.')-2] == ' '   on line 10. It's just a style issue.
03:49 bairui: also - what is your completion map for calling this function?
03:49 iaj: sec
03:49 iaj: inoremap <tab> <c-r>=MyTabComplete()<cr>
03:50 bairui: ok
03:51 bairui: so, you can't get the bad behaviour now...?
03:51 iaj: Hmmm dunno lemme check
03:54 iaj: When I have a floating(fuzzyfinder's) buffer.. and it disappears... which au event is this?
03:54 iaj:     au WinEnter * let &l:statusline = g:c_statusline
03:54 iaj:     au WinLeave * let &l:statusline = g:nc_statusline
03:54 iaj: those 2 don't cover it.
03:54 iaj: so its not winenter :(
03:54 bairui: BufEnter/Leave 
03:54 bairui: ?
03:54 iaj: E15: Invalid expression: .)[col('.')-2] == ' '
03:55 bairui: if getline('.')[col('.')-2] == ' '
03:55 iaj:     if getline(.)[col('.')-2] == ' '
03:55 bairui: no - you need   ('.')   not   (.)
03:56 iaj: Ahhh ok
