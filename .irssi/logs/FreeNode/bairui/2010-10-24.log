00:05 bairui: ok, back. No problem, man. Any time (that I'm available! ;) )
00:07 iaj: hmm heh..
00:07 iaj: can I somehow have a function
00:07 iaj: that's executing
00:07 iaj: :ProjectLCD = which returns a path I think
00:07 iaj: actually its switching to its path 
00:08 bairui: you could create a function   :CD   to switch to a project and modify the   'tags'   option among other things.
00:08 iaj: its so strange
00:09 iaj: I do ctags and have a good file
00:09 iaj: but TList not showing a think
00:09 iaj: thing*
00:09 bairui: what does   :set tags?   say?
00:09 bairui: the TList window split opens up, yeah?
00:09 iaj: http://pastebin.com/t2m1MCiL
00:10 iaj: I generated the tags file myself I THOUGHT
00:10 iaj:   tags=./tags,../tags,../../tags,../../../tags,../../../../tags,../../../../../tags,/Users/tags
00:10 iaj: lolz.
00:11 bairui: urgh... that doesn't look right - the pastebin, I mean... what OS?
00:11 iaj: macosx
00:11 bairui: well, TagList says it will take care of generating your tags for you, IIRC
00:11 iaj: i know..... gna :\
00:12 bairui: maybe delete the existing tags files and try   :TList   again...?
00:12 iaj: /usr/bin/ctags
00:12 iaj: is wrong actually
00:12 iaj: which is output from !which ctags
00:12 iaj: I got a much more recent one in /Users/iaj/bin
00:12 iaj: /Users/iaj/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
00:12 bairui: then you need to modify your  PATH  before starting Vim
00:12 iaj: is my $PATH tho in MacVim
00:12 bairui: ah
00:12 iaj: Im so curious!!!!
00:13 iaj: Why is it bugging with /usr/bin first??!
00:13 bairui: in Vim, type   :echo $PATH
00:14 bairui: your PATH might be getting reset in some system vimrc somwhere... (or, perhaps in your ~/.vimrc)
00:15 iaj: the result above
00:15 iaj: was :echo $PATH
00:15 iaj: in MacVIm
00:15 iaj: When I launch mvim from Shell...
00:17 iaj: " 3. If the exuberant ctags utility is not present in your PATH, then set the
00:17 iaj: "    Tlist_Ctags_Cmd variable to point to the location of the exuberant ctags
00:17 iaj: "    utility (not to the directory) in the .vimrc file.
00:17 bairui: ok - so you could set that in your ~/.vimrc
00:20 iaj: hmm I guess its because of ecli
00:20 iaj: m
00:20 bairui: ah... :(
00:20 bairui: heard nothing but grief from that bad boy...
00:20 iaj: heh
00:20 iaj: yeah
00:20 iaj: but I WONT USE AN IDE !!!!!!!!
00:22 bairui: use the force, Luke. Learn to let go of your IDEs. Search your feelings. Code in Vim the Right Way.         :)
00:22 iaj: hahahahah that made me laugh
00:22 bairui: :)
00:22 iaj: Wtf is wrong with that ctags.. gna
00:23 bairui: did you try explicitly setting it as in the help chunk you pasted here...?
00:24 iaj: ohmmygoodd..
00:24 iaj: yeah
00:24 iaj: I did
00:24 iaj: =~/bin/ctags
00:24 iaj: AND NOT 
00:24 iaj: "~/bin/ctags"
00:24 iaj: how I hate such errors
00:24 iaj: !
00:24 bairui: :)
00:25 iaj: Btw... are you using.. hmmm - what was it... delimitMate?
00:26 bairui: I don't use delimitMate. I find predictive tools like that to be a bit frustrating... But I support Raimondi and his efforts on that plugin.
00:28 iaj: heh.. yeah sometimes it drives me
00:28 iaj: a bit crazy :D
00:29 bairui: some like it. some don't. I guess if you started out that way, you'd be used to it. I started out having to write every single character - even spaces for indents... so, I guess I'm an old dinosaur in that regard. :)  Don't get me wrong - I *do* use Vim's indent plugins, and they're mostly cool... but even then I sometimes get frustrated about the wrong guesses they make...
00:32 iaj: heh.. yeah... well someitmies its really nice.. if you got more brackts
00:32 iaj: heh
00:33 iaj: another thing, can I see which tags file is currently used?
00:33 iaj: you got a mapping for the taglist
00:33 iaj: ?
00:33 bairui: well... Vim uses multiple concurrent tags file, so... no, not really...
00:33 bairui: I use F6
00:33 bairui: no rational reason why...
00:33 iaj: f6 is so far away
00:34 iaj: you doing tlisttoggle?
00:34 bairui: yep
00:34 bairui: the way I look at it, jumping to the TList is such a cognative interruption, that it warrants a greater finger reach to trigger...
00:37 iaj: :-)
00:37 iaj: is there a way to update taglist automatically to show which function one is currenlty on?
00:37 iaj: currently- sorry
00:38 bairui: I think it does by default...
00:39 bairui: afk for a few minutes, mate.
00:43 iaj: hehe..its quite a challenge setting this one up
