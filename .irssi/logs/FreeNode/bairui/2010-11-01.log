09:39 iaj: lo 
09:39 iaj: my friend
09:39 iaj: :-)
09:39 iaj: sorry I went to sleep yesterday
09:39 bairui: g'day, mate. How are ya?
09:39 iaj: I'm so unrelieable
09:39 iaj: "-))
09:39 bairui: no problem :)
09:40 bairui: me too :)
09:40 iaj: heh.. fine.. im sitting in college right now
09:40 bairui: cool
09:40 iaj: listening and not trying to fall asleep
09:40 bairui: lecture?
09:40 iaj: I asked raimondi about that vimoutliner yesterday and grabbed his version
09:40 iaj: oh
09:40 iaj: Formal definitions of computer science
09:40 bairui: cool.
09:40 iaj: it would be called in english
09:41 iaj: can you tell me how you typically use tvo?
09:41 iaj: you told me you are using it for mindmaps as well right?
09:41 bairui: I use it to take notes, make plans, lay out my ideas in something I need to write... that sort of thing.
09:41 iaj: the thing with make plans - lay out ideas
09:42 iaj: how do you do that?
09:42 bairui: yeah - I don't like graphical mind map tools (although Freemind is kinda cute). I said TVO was *like* a text based mind map tool.
09:42 iaj: can you tell me your way of processing
09:43 bairui: well, each big idea, or big part of a single idea is a level one, and then I nest subparts under that. The exact structure might depend on what the idea is...
09:43 iaj: yeah
09:44 bairui: Hmm... to be honest, I tend to do most of my new thinking on paper - away from the console. Too many distractions in front of the computer. Then I'll come back and arrange it into an outline (if needed).
09:44 bairui: The outline is for persistent storage of an idea - and to allow easy modification and collaboration if necessary and appropriate.
09:45 iaj: heh.. that sounds pretty good...
09:46 bairui: it works for me :)
09:46 iaj: can you tell me *how* you do it, eg.. what keypressess
09:46 bairui: How do you currently take notes in a lecture?
09:46 bairui: ah... I see.
09:47 bairui: Well, I mostly just use Tab and Backspace to create my indent levels as I bang in info
09:47 bairui: I might need to move a branch, and I tend to fold it, cut and paste it elsewhere to do that
09:47 iaj: heh :-) yeah..  + can you send me a note file or make a sshot how it looks like
09:47 iaj: mhhh.. so you use mostly indenting? no hotkeys?
09:50 bairui: mostly not... I remember that TVO has a heap of hotkeys... I don't use most. I do use its checkbox feature often - which is on my   ,,cb  and  ,,cx  to check it.
09:54 iaj: hmmm... ok I just want to see how such a 'mindmap' looks like when its finished =)

10:01 bairui: TVO comes with several good outline examples - the checkbox one, the math one... even the README :)
10:06 bairui: well, I gotta cook dinner now, mate. Have a great day. :D Bye.
10:09 iaj: heh.. thanks bairui sorry Im just crawling through its help
10:09 iaj: thanks so far :)
