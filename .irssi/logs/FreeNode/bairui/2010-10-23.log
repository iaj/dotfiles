23:43 --- Query: Starting query with bairui on FreeNode
23:43 iaj: lo there
23:43 iaj: heh
23:43 iaj: do you actually code in vim?
23:43 bairui: yep... not a lot these days, though.
23:43 iaj: hah.. oh.. yeah I've forgotten
23:43 iaj: how's it looking will you have some more time soon?
23:44 iaj: are there any plugins that give you a list of functions of the current file?
23:44 bairui: yeah... I think so. Starting to get on top of it.
23:44 bairui: I use TagList for that
23:44 bairui: it uses ctags - it's good
23:47 iaj: on top of it.. you have a new appointment as a teacher
23:47 iaj: right?
23:47 iaj: hmm... yeh.. I'm gonna try Taglist
23:47 iaj: but doesn't taglist show all the tags?
23:47 bairui: it splits them out into global defines, classes, functions
23:48 bairui: yeah - new teacher in a primary - lots of 'new's for me - so was a bit swamped there for a while.
23:48 bairui: didn't help that admin wanted great chunks of our time too... but that's cutting back now, so.... *hopefully* I will get some more me time. :)
23:49 iaj: heh.. hopefully
23:49 iaj: I'm pressing thumbs man
23:50 bairui: be careful - taglist() != TagList
23:50 bairui: you're doing pushups on your thumbs?
23:51 bairui: We used to have to do that for TKD - hard! :) couldn't do more than a few... lol... my thumb-of-death would never match Sean Connery's in ... what was that movie called...?
23:54 iaj: pushup on my thumbs.. uuhh that must be hurting!!
23:54 iaj: hmm i dunno :( but sounds interesting
23:54 iaj: oh well i got a problem mat
23:54 iaj: e
23:54 bairui: wassup?
23:54 iaj: ./this/is/a/large/path/to/my/class
23:54 iaj: and the tag file i generated
23:54 iaj: is in ./this/is/a/tags
23:54 iaj: how do I need to set tags to load that one up?
23:55 bairui: you should be able to set the  tags  option in vim to include that path:   :set tags+=./this/is/a/tags
23:55 iaj: hmmm so i need to set that globally?
23:55 iaj: I wished to set it to
23:55 iaj: use the tags file that's coming next when you cd .. 
23:56 bairui: you can have multiple entries in the   tags   option.  :help 'tags'.  Sorry, I gotta go for a while, mate. Back later.
23:57 iaj: Alright , thanks a lot for your help
23:57 iaj: once more
23:57 iaj: <3 !
