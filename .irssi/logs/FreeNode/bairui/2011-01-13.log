13:19 --- Query: Starting query with bairui on FreeNode
13:19 iaj: hmm i don't quite understand it.. if I want to have single line comments as just # 
13:19 iaj: how would I do that?
13:21 bairui: follow the link to   format-comments   and read that first :)
13:22 iaj: hmmm I tried but I couldn't get it solved :)
13:23 bairui: :)
13:25 iaj: im too dumb it seems
13:25 bairui: not at all, dude. I have NFI either - just reading the docs now too. :p
13:25 iaj: haha... ok... normally im just trying to find an example
13:26 bairui: try:   :set comments=:#
13:26 bairui: i cheated - i opened a ruby file and typed   :set comments?
13:29 iaj: hmm im using nerdcommenter
13:29 iaj: but its still using /*   */
13:29 iaj: why o why :)
13:29 bairui: i dunno...
13:33 iaj: how can I enter more ...         autocmd FileType typoscript setlocal comments=:#
13:33 iaj: like another setlocal there...
13:33 bairui: btw: to put the &filetype in insert mode:   <c-r>=&ft<CR>
13:33 iaj: what's the right syntax :)
13:33 iaj: yeah... figured that one
13:33 iaj: forgot about c-r =
13:34 bairui: I don't understand what you mean with   'enter more'  there... is that a modeline? A line in your vimrc?
13:34 iaj: yeah a line in my vimrc
13:34 iaj: and I don't want 2 lines
13:34 iaj: only one :)
13:34 iaj: but want to set another set there
13:35 bairui: oi! use 2 lines
13:35 bairui: these are arguments to either   set   or   setlocal
