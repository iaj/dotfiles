00:39  temp01: write proper code?
00:39  Third3ye: :P
00:39  Third3ye: A key :D
00:39  aro: pay someone with a brain to do it
00:39  Phrogz_: Third3ye: jQuery runs on one computer. PHP runs on another. The Internet connects them. HTTP is the language they both speak.
00:39 * dabear agrees with temp01
00:39  Third3ye: Ah good :)
00:39  Third3ye: There is attention :P
00:40  temp01: and you've got the noob label and now you'll forever be stuck with it
00:40  Phrogz_: Third3ye: Look at jQuery's "ajax" section of documentation.
00:41  Third3ye: Yeah I did, I'm stuck at where I send the form and the script doesn't parse the JSON, it just outputs it to the browser like a json file
00:41  temp01: pastebin code
00:41  Third3ye: http://pastie.org/1298295
00:41  Third3ye: Pastie rules ^^
00:42  temp01: you have a <submit> element?
00:42  temp01: you want $('#eForm').submit(fn) not $('#eForm submit').click(fn)

00:46  aro: how do i bind ajaxError to all elements?
00:46  aro: or basically make it act as a global listener
00:47  temp01: $(document).ajaxError?
00:47  aro: ok
00:50  aro: temp01: unfortunately, when i do $.ajaxError() - it executes about 30 times for the failed ajax request.. any idea why?
00:50  temp01: are you using 1.4.4
00:51  aro: 1.4.2 i think
00:51  aro: 1.4.1
00:51  temp01: I dunno why. try with 1.4.4 and see if it works
00:52  aro: ok
00:55  aro: what do you know.. that fixed it

01:11  marsander: Hello guys, what's wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/FPnYD/
01:12  aro: whats it supposed to do?
01:13  temp01: bind change event on select. click on options isn't reliable
01:13  marsander: aro: if you click on -new gallery- i wanna get an alert box.
01:13  marsander: temp01: and how can i check your click the last option?
01:13  wesbos1: your selector is wrong
01:13  temp01: you can check the selectedIndex or give the option a value and check that or just check the option text
01:14  temp01: value is the best. you can just do select.change( if(this.value == 'new') createNewGallery() )
01:17  marsander: ?change
01:17  bot-t: .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
01:20  marsander: temp01: i think that i need help with the select.change stuff http://jsfiddle.net/FPnYD/1/
01:20  temp01: what I posted was pseudo code not actually valid javascript
01:21  temp01: the syntax is similar to click method so you need the function(){}
01:21  marsander: temp01: $("select").change(???);
01:21  temp01: rtfm man

02:20  Lumpio-: You could load jQuery in the head
02:20  mattalexx: Lumpio-, No that's a no?

02:22  mattalexx: $('out-put2') is wrong
02:22  bot-t: compaq, That's not a valid selector.
02:22  Lumpio-: A little blob of script in the head that queues all the functinos and calls them at the bottom
02:22  mattalexx: $('.out-put2') ?
02:22  mattalexx: $('#out-put2') ?
02:22  compaq: mattalexx, thank you

03:01  RobertV: what the search method in jquery? say i wanted to find if the word 'foo' is inside a <p> tag: $("p").contents().indexOf("foo")
03:01  khmer: $("p.contains('foo')")
03:02  RobertV: thnx
03:02  khmer: wait that's wrong
03:02  khmer: $("p:contains('foo')")
03:02  RobertV: :contains()
03:02  khmer: it's a pseudoclass, not a function
03:02  khmer: :)
03:03  khmer: so it'll return elements that contain foo
03:03  khmer: if it returns no elements, there's your answer
03:03  RobertV: null?
03:03  khmer: the jQuery object will never be null
03:04  khmer: its elements are its only enumerable properties, so you can test its length
03:04  RobertV: 0
03:04  khmer: exactly
03:04  RobertV: $("p:contains('foo')").length
03:05  khmer: if ($("p:contains('foo')").length===0) { alert('no paragraphs contain foo')}
03:05  RobertV: ok
03:10  rpk: Hello, could someone please explain to me why replaceWith when loading an ajax page containing javascript functions does not overwrite the functions previously loaded with replaceWith:?  calling html seems to overwrite them.
03:16  compaq: How do you work on a selector on another page?
03:18  compaq: I am on say page 1, that has a button, and then when it is clicked, it will open page two with window.location.href='page2.html' and then there is a form on page two and I want to change the value attr.  SO I did $('.the-class').val('somthn');, but it doesn't work
03:21  rpk: Anyone? The docs describe it as replacing the prior content.  How do my functions still exist?  I would expect the prior content to be removed?
03:24  jrockjiggz: rpk: I ran into this problem aswell, i wasn't using replaceWith, but rather php include() which was loading the same function, but the 1st instance always took precendence (including it's vars' values).  I solved it with a workaround that used php
03:25  rpk: Its just weird that my function, which was loaded within the scope of a div, is not removed by replaceWith, and even weirder that calling .html does in fact remove the function correctly.
03:26  rpk: Is it a bug or intentional?/
03:26  jrockjiggz: i'd like to know myself, I always thought js never got removed unless you specify
03:31 --- joeyaa|Zzz is now known as joeyaa
03:33  rpk: jrockjiggz: From Stack Overflow: Note that the replaceWith() will not actually delete the element but simply remove it from the DOM and return it to you in the collection.
03:33 --- SuperSlexy is now known as SlexAxton
03:33  rpk: removing it from the DOM doesn't remove the function apparently/
03:37  rpk: I would argue that this is still a bug due to the way binding to the dom and binding to closed functions worked.  I have to check my implementation to verify this, but I believe my functions are being rebound to new dom from the replaced (newly scoped) closures.
03:41  digitalfiz: anyone here familiar with facebox?
03:42  digitalfiz: im trying to use $(document).bind('reveal.facebox', function() { alert("Hello"); }); but its not working
03:42  digitalfiz: all i really want is to run soe code after the facebox box opens up
03:45  rpk: Actually, I trigger my closures, therefore the functions are in fact rebinding to the new dom .  I still
03:46  rpk: I still think that the replaceWith function should remove functions, or at least specify that detaching the dom will not detach functions in the documentation ^^
03:54  jrockjiggz: rpk: then why does HTML() work?
03:59  rpk: jrockjiggz: html deletes the element from the dom rather than dettaching.
03:59  rpk: From the docs: "jQuery empties the element before calling the function;"

11:18  doonie: ?prepend
11:18  bot-t: .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
11:18  doonie: magic ball says yes
11:18  harshamv: :D thanks
11:19  harshamv: if i have a li element and wanna place another li element.. above the present one. i should use this ?
11:19  doonie: sure
11:19  harshamv: thanks doonie :D
11:20  doonie: sure ;>
11:21  monkeynut: harshamv: I don't think this will give you what you want
11:21  borismus: If I want to pass parameters between jQuery pages, shuld I be using subPageUrls?
11:21  doonie: monkeynut let him learn by his own trial and error :}
11:21  borismus: Sorry, that was a JQM question
11:21  monkeynut: harshamv: it always puts what you are inserting as the first element, not just above a particular one.
11:22  monkeynut: he he, ok doonie, just thought he may need more pointing ...
11:24  sean`: OMG
11:24  sean`: harshamv,
11:26  doonie: omg omg lunch time!
11:26  VorTechS: hi all ;)
11:28  BMCouto: good morning
11:29  sean`: harshamv, why don't you read
11:29  sean`: The jQuery manual litteraly states: "The .append() method inserts the specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery collection (To insert it as the first child, use .prepend()).
11:29  sean`: "
11:29  JKarsrud: anyone know if there are any bugs with focus() in chrome?
11:29  blackspotwiggins: good morning
11:32  JKarsrud: or maybe the :radio selector
11:33  sean`: JKarsrud, splain
11:35  JKarsrud: sean`: making a testcase now, but do you know if maybe chrome doesn't like focus on radiobuttons?
11:37  JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/f3AWm/
11:37  oodavid: would it be straightforward to save a DOM snippet as stands, modify it, then "restore" it back to how it was without really changing anything?
11:40  ElGoorf: JKarsrud, you havent got them in a <form>
11:40  JKarsrud: ElGoorf: Makes no difference, the focus-event isn't firing in webkit at all
11:41  JKarsrud: ElGoorf: Because when you bind a click-event to them, it works
11:42  JKarsrud: Is this a bug in jQuery's focus, or is it a chrome/webkit bug?
11:43  ElGoorf: i've never used focus before so i dont know what to expect :/
11:43  ElGoorf: oh, i just read
11:44  ElGoorf: no idea :s
11:44  JKarsrud: Doesn't work in IE* either
11:44  ElGoorf: it doesnt do anything in mozilla ff either
11:44  JKarsrud: It does
11:44  JKarsrud: It works as expected in Fx
11:44  ElGoorf: :S
11:48  Nick_Meister: hi guys how would i go about adding new rows to a table
11:48  sean`: JKarsrud, it's not jQuery afaik
11:48  JKarsrud: Weird, if you don't specify input:radio, but just say :radio, it fails in IE, but with input:radio it works in IE
11:49  sean`: it's just chrome
11:49  JKarsrud: Still no go in chrome, so then it's chrome's fault
11:49  JKarsrud: click() it is then
11:51  JKarsrud: Thankfully it's really not my problem :)

11:53  sean`: FTW
11:53  sean`: ?wtf
11:53  bot-t: sean`, The Dead Guy's Password -  http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Dead-Guys-Password.aspx
11:54  Nick_Meister: sean`, $('#myTable > tbody:last') -what does that mean?
11:54  oodavid: cheers monkeynut!
11:54  sean`: Nick_Meister, that you need to learn CSS
11:54  sean`: it selects the LAST tbody from your table
11:54  monkeynut: np oodavid ;)
11:54  sean`: Which makes no sense..
11:54  sean`: If it were tbody tr:last, oke, I'd be cool with that
11:55  Nick_Meister: sean`, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171027/jquery-add-table-row
11:55  sean`: yeah
11:56  sean`: You don't need to worry about tbody
11:56  sean`: jQuery does tha tfor ya!
11:56  Nick_Meister: sean`, according to that there is two ways of doing this it is not clear which one is better
11:56  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, sean`  what's wrong with just $('#table tbody').append(myrows)?
11:56  monkeynut: Nick_Meister: which is 'better' will generally depend on context.
11:57  monkeynut: Nick_Meister: but as few dom insertions as possible is always faster.
11:57  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, the problem arises what will happen if there are no rows to begin with
11:57  monkeynut: then $('#table tbody').append will still do exactly what you want.
11:58  monkeynut: (as sean` pointed out, don't actually need tbody in there, jquery takes care of that bit)
11:58  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, so i can just not have a tbody and itll put it in if it dont already exist?
11:58  sean`: Nick_Meister, jQuery.support.tbody tells you wether or not your browser does it by default
11:59  monkeynut: Nick_Meister: that behavior depends on browser partly, I was only referring to having it in the selector.
12:01  JKarsrud: sean`: Haha, that video was epic :D
12:01  Nick_Meister: monkeynut,  so i should use $("#table tbody") then and nothing else right?
12:02  monkeynut: Nick_Meister: $('#table tbody').append(myrow);  will always add a new row to the end of your table. go with it ;)
12:06  sean`: Nick_Meister, http://jsfiddle.net/evZF7/
12:06  sean`: look
12:06  sean`: fuck tbdoy
12:15  red: Hi, I'm having a problem with our CDN, I've set apache to discard cookies, but we use jquery.cookies plugin and I imagine that might be overriding it somehow?
12:15  red: Does anyone know if this might be the case, and how to restrict the cookie plugin from certain subdomains? :o
12:15  BMCouto: sean' when will be the ***ing lunch?
12:15  ElGoorf: is it even possible for javascript to override a server setting? O.o
12:16  red: im not sure, just trying to locate the problem
12:16  sean`: BMCouto, I can't this week
12:16  red: atleast one can set and read cookies with JS even after headers are sent
12:16  red: so I imagine that might be the reason

12:18  red: The JS cookie is being set like this: $.cookie('survey_seen', 'seen', { expires: 90, path: '/' });"
12:18  mainiak: could you please post me that link, where I could create demo?
12:20  red: Pagespeed is saying that referer of the cookie is xx.site.com and the images are being served from yy.site.com
12:20  Aragon: mainiak, http://jsfiddle.net
12:20  mainiak: Aragon, thank you :)
12:20  red: so if anyone knows how the cookie plugin works, would be cool to get some tips
12:20  Aragon: mainiak, no problem... ;) its also in the topic btw ;
12:21  mainiak: I have overlooked it
12:22  slaskis: i'm doing a jsonp call with $.ajax and recieve a 401 unauthorized response, but no callback is being fired. i'm 'listening' to success, error and complete but none of them gets called. is this the expected behavior?
12:23  mainiak: http://jsfiddle.net/3avXf/1/
12:23  mainiak: what I am doing wrong?
12:23 * mainiak need to say - this my first time with ajax
12:26  blackspotwiggins: mainiak, you cant do crossdomain ajax
12:26  mainiak: blackspotwiggins, why?
12:27  blackspotwiggins: security
12:27  mainiak: huh
12:27  mainiak: but I need to load something and it will probably be placed on different server :-/
12:30  red: use php
12:30  mainiak: yeah
12:30  red: call a local php file with ajax, that downloads a html file from the remote server
12:30  red: that html file could have output by php for example
12:31  mainiak: red: I had a very crazy job - i am writing "full app" in JS, and I cannot say to customer - hey we will throw this **** away, because it is weired and bad anyway
12:31  mainiak: red: thanks!
12:32  mainiak: maybe I could force them to put that file on the server, where the app will be placed :-)
12:32  blackspotwiggins: unreasonable demands are met with unreasonable responses
12:32  red: :)
12:32 * mainiak still thinks writing "full JS" app is bad
12:33  red: I dont really know much bout AJAX anyway though, but had to do that kinda php-workaround for a script that queries a shoutcast servers last played list
12:33  Phil: I read something about cross domain ajax
12:33  Phil: with PJSON (maybe?)
12:33  red: So now every time user navigates to the page, the external html file with the songlist is downloaded to the local server and then the latest song is regexped from it and displayed via JS :P
12:33  Solow: Phil, not possible unless using a 'proxy'
12:33  jetienne: mainiak: why
12:33  juha_: if those servers have jsonp, then use ?getjson @ red
12:33  bot-t: jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
12:33  Phil: eh, JSONP
12:33  mainiak: jetienne, why what?
12:33  Phil: Solow, this seems to suggest otherwise
12:34  jetienne: mainiak: why do you think it is bad
12:34  red: juha_: it's just like this http://212.226.170.150:8000/7.html
12:34  Solow: Phil, that's not your typical ajax. that jsonp
12:34  red: http://radioasia.fi/sites/default/themes/radioasia/ajaxrequest.js
12:34  red: I imagine this is far from optimal but worked :)
12:34  mainiak: jetienne, if i compare JS solution whit PHP solution - PHP would be faster, cheaper and better - in this current project
12:35  jetienne: mok
12:35  jetienne: mainiak: ok
12:38  mainiak: jetienne, my app parse xml, creates forms, call java applet to load files, and after finish, it creates xml and trough java applet sends files to server
12:39  BG_: how can I detect anchor changes in the URL without reloading the page or using timers? (anchor being url#anchor)

13:04  monkeynut: mainiak, if you're getting xml back, you can refer to it with $(response)  and do stuff like .find() and .text() on tags in your xml structure. .text() will only work on xml leafs, for obvious reasons ;)
13:05  mainiak: http://jsfiddle.net/3avXf/4/

13:18  snoy_ms: i dont get how they changed the pictures (gallery). At first i thought the use scroll to, and only changed the view position
13:20  Shwaiil: Q: Any sugestions on creating a pre-loader for single images ? Thanks
13:21  denysonique: Shwaiil, preload them with html/css not js
13:21  denysonique: Shwaiil, if that is going to be for hover images
13:21  Shwaiil: denysonique, is there a way to check if the image is ready ?
13:21  Shwaiil: I would like to place a loader animation while not
13:21  denysonique: Shwaiil, Please describe your problem, to get the best solution.
13:22  fris: lazyloader jquery plugin would do that
13:22  Shwaiil: denysonique, let's say I've got a UL LI, where there's a thumbnaill image, with a title, ref and description. This is being used on a slide gallery. There's a bunch of images.
13:22  snoy_ms: I tried to find out how they do it on http://www.thisiscollate.com
13:23  snoy_ms: iam just interested in...do they change the picture or the view
13:23  Shwaiil: The browser takes awhile to load them. So, I would like to have a loader animation, while the image is being downloaded.
13:23  Shwaiil: So, when the image is ready, I remove  the "load animation"
13:24  mainiak: blackspotwiggins, you were right - I am stupid - I used server and fixed it - thanks :)
13:25  denysonique: Shwaiil, you can place the loader image below the loaded image, for example. Or us JS.
13:25  denysonique: s/us/use/
13:25  Shwaiil: denysonique, oh, nice point ;D
13:26  Shwaiil: Thanks a lot for your tip, really good one ;D
13:26  denysonique: Shwaiil, do the basic html—image below—version and then enchance it with JS
13:26  thyphus: if i have a <input> and a list via <select><option /></select>, how do i tell the select-list to go to the next or previous option/entry? my idea is to select a option out of the input via up/down

13:27  innociv_: How do I find out what uses so much memory with my web app?  It'll start at around 150mb, raise up steadily to hundreds of mb.
13:28  denysonique: thyphus, Web browsers already enable users to select select-options using the arrow buttons.
13:28  thyphus: denysonique: not if the input is focused...
13:28  denysonique: thyphus, By the way, focus() might be what you are looking for.
13:29  denysonique: Then you can focus back on input(). Just think in a more creative way.

17:14  Hickeroar: one of the function has the line $('#mydiv').sortable({update:this.reorderListing});
17:14  Hickeroar: problem is, in the event handler function "reorderListing" I need access to "this" or at least I need to get the object scope back in some way
17:14  Hickeroar: what's the best way to accomplish that?
17:15  SwiftOne: CFNinja: I don't see anything wrong in the theory of what you're doing.  So long as you're not returning false nor calling e.stopPropagation() it should work...
17:15  CFNinja: SwiftOne: thanks.

17:17  nicola: ciao list
17:17  Hickeroar: anyone?
17:17  Hickeroar: bueler?
17:18  Tallisman: You are but men, but with divine power?
17:18  halogenandtoast: Does anyone know why I would be getting an error like Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'onCleanup', when using a pretty standard fancybox setup
17:18  Tallisman: Hahaha, i'll quit :P
17:18  monkeynut: Hickeroar: not sure about sortable, but you can add extra parameters to event handlers if you're using bind.
17:18  monkeynut: ?bind @ Hickeroar
17:18  bot-t: Hickeroar, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
17:19  Hickeroar: Sorry, I'm a relative noob to JS. Can you explain that idea to me briefly?  haha
17:19  monkeynut: so it should be possible from sortable api, if not you may have to bind your own handler to whatever its update event is called.
17:19  Hickeroar: you can use that bind thing in sortable. I've seen it in the docs, but I didnt really know what it meant
17:20  Hickeroar: do I replace the .sortable() call with the bind() one?
17:20  Hickeroar: or do they work in conjuction?
17:20  monkeynut: Hickeroar: in conjunction, but only if they don't provide a neat way with the api
17:21  Hickeroar: im so confused...  :-P
17:21  Hickeroar: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
17:21  monkeynut: Hickeroar: if you describe your requirements a little more clearly we might be able to help with the best way to go about solving your problem
17:21  Hickeroar: OK.

17:21  Hickeroar: let me pastebin a few things. I'll brb
17:21  eax: Hi there, I am having a ripe pickle with the jQuery UI Multiselect from http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect - My code: http://pastebin.com/wtckRs7r - I expected it to open a box with the multiselect inside, but nothing happens? I am clueless as to what could be wrong :S
17:22  monkeynut: mov $0x00, %eax
17:23  eax: monkeynut: Come again?
17:23  Tallisman: Monkeynut, if i say, i want to crack a captcha - is that possible?
17:23  Tallisman: ofcourse without payed OCR
17:24  Tallisman: :P
17:24  monkeynut: that's assembly for put zero in eax (cpu register, your nic).  Seen your question and looked at the code, nothing jumps out but I don't have time to check thoroughly, just letting you know you're not being ignored ;)
17:24  monkeynut: Tallisman: yes and no, depends on the captcha.
17:25  monkeynut: Tallisman: you could roll your own SVM or ANN to do the job.  I'm not really going to point any more than that because although theoretically interesting i'd never help someone break anti-spam protections.
17:25  eax: monkeynut: ahh, thought I recognized it :) Thanks a lot ;) I've been struggling with it for some time. If I remove ALL the includes except the pure jQuery one, the box can open. But then I am missing the multiselect ><
17:25  monkeynut: eax, what errors do you get in your debugger?
17:25  dev2: is there an input mask plugin anybody would recommend?
17:26  eax: monkeynut: None :S
17:26  Tallisman: true that, if a captcha is overruled, you could spam any form in current existance :P
17:27  monkeynut: eax, strange, so you remove other js file and it basically works? sounds like a conflict somewhere, does another script re-define $ ??
17:27  Tallisman: well that's intresting.. better than my pathetic loic attacks =_=
17:27  halogenandtoast: Figured out my problem. CSS wasn't being loaded. Not sure how CSS fixes JS callback problems
17:27  eax: monkeynyet: yeah, it does. Not to my knowledge no.
17:28  Hickeroar2: OK http://pastebin.com/C2b3wpPR

17:31  halogenandtoast: The error message was: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'onCleanup'
17:31  Hickeroar2: ablomen: will it be "this" or "that" in the reorderListing method?
17:31  ablomen: this
17:31  Hickeroar2: OK thx.
17:32  Hickeroar2: I'll be back in a few then
17:32  halogenandtoast: Not sure where CSS values fixed that, by css values, I mean loading a .css file

17:33  monkeynut: halogenandtoast    it's funny how it take a while when coding to realise you're still down the rabbit hole and that cat is not everything it might seem.
17:33  ablomen: Hickeroar2, though if you are writing code like that, it's a safe bet to always put this in a var like that or self or something, this prevents these kinds of issues
17:33  ablomen: (i only ever use this to define "self" or in jquery callback functions)
17:34  Tallisman: but you have used assembly monkeynut? O.o, i never understood that really, however my first windows application was written in asm xD

17:36  denysonique: would remove work?
17:36  ablomen: Hickeroar2, nvm

17:37  denysonique: ok I gonna try that.
17:37  cjm: anyone here using heavy coffeescript in conjunction with jQuery?
17:37  monkeynut: Tallisman: I've done shed-loads of languages, don't write in assembler, just use that for reverse engineering and malware analysis e.t.c.

17:39  jeremyw: Can you use .text() against an arbitrary string?  I tried it and the result was an error.  Basically, I need a way to take a string, replace XML entities and return the string.  .text() will do that but I can't seem to figure out how to use it when the left side is not an element.
17:40  nbari: Hi, again, I am redesigning my paginator, this time trying to use some of the best practices found on the net, I am using json for getting the data of a databsae and on the fly create he html with jquery. in this last step I am using .clone() for getting a copy of the current table structure and later on a loop just append() the values to each row, but how I would like to know hot to convert from the .clone() to html

17:52  Aristata: What's worse it when I unpause the debugger and start after the error, everything works fine...
17:52  Pilate: why would you dump the html as opposed to appending it to something?
17:52  Aristata: Just how it was supposed to.
17:52  nbari: this is what i am usging: http://pastebin.com/YSBRYLiE
17:53  nbari: I parece the elements of the clone and alter storethem on the array but maybe i need to appendem to the array
17:53  Aristata: Are there some general rules to follow to get your script working in IE? A blog of gotchas maybe?
17:53  nbari: how in this case I can append the clone to an array[] ?
17:55  Pilate: theres so much wrong with that paste i dont even know where to start
17:56  nbari: mmm what it is wrong ?
17:57  nbari: what I am trying to do is to get the 'dummy' <td>

18:40  rogerdoger: that wont be an onif?
18:40  rogerdoger: elseif*
18:40  rogerdoger: causing each to fire
18:40  danheberden: a while loop can break
18:40  danheberden: so it's like if/else in that sense

18:41  vacho: thats a json object right? and not an array?

18:44  rogerdoger: actually
18:44  rogerdoger: i++ shouldnt be there
18:44  danheberden: rogerdoger: as pointed out, you can just do your return bizness in there
18:44  vacho: http://pastebin.com/grxhBnvQ
18:44  danheberden: rogerdoger: just do $('#menu_' + i++
18:45  danheberden: it will use i as it's value as-is, THEN add one to it afterward for ya
18:45  vacho: I want to replace the result of the json call with the source:
18:45  danheberden: but think too, can you get away from explicit ids?
18:45  danheberden: maybe just classnames?
18:45  danheberden: just get the visible one, and do what ya need?
18:45  rogerdoger: yes i suppose
18:46  rogerdoger: im trying to understand how this works, maybe it was that lack of a coffee this monday morning
18:46  vacho: danheberden: any ideas?
18:46  rogerdoger: but i just feel like this will continue to loop and show them all when fired
18:47  danheberden: rogerdoger: if you return or break, the loop will cease
18:47  danheberden: vacho - so you're trying to update the auotcomplete data?
18:47  vacho: yes
18:47  danheberden: cuz autocomplete takes a source function for that
18:47  vacho: the json return will contain the data
18:47 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon

18:49  vacho: ya, whats wrong with that?
18:49  vacho: oh okay
18:49  vacho: got it
18:49  danheberden: just a bit more work... $('#whatev').autocomplete('option', 'source', newObj )

18:50  vacho: have u done it before?

19:08  vacho: i have to define jsonp, json results in an error
19:08  danheberden: nbari: your use of clone is a performance hit, but you can just put the array of nodes into jquery, like $( yourArrOfStuff ).appendTo('#something');
19:09  danheberden: your use of join('') implies the array is full of html, if you did row.html()
19:10  nbari: I am using clone for using a 'model' html and later based on that 'model' just fill/craeate the table
19:10  nbari: all that part works, the problem is that I do not know how to take them out of the array
19:10  danheberden: nbari: you're right, it works
19:10  vacho: danheberden: It's making the call correctly now, I think my problem lies in the sucess function where it's doing some mapping...
19:10  danheberden: i'm just letting you know clone is a big performance hit
19:11  danheberden: creating html and inserting it is WAY faster
19:11  vacho: danheberden: my json service just returns a simple json object, I don't think it needs any mapping
19:11  nbari: oh ok, but in this case how can i make it work?
19:11  danheberden: if you haven't checked out $.tmpl or mustache, i recommend it
19:11  sveajobb: danheberden, so if you want to create a template of some sort, how would you do it? I prefer not to declare the html inside of js
19:11  nbari: the array table[] as all the clones/parsed but how to put it on the web
19:12  danheberden: nbari - like i said, put those elements into a jquery collection $( table ) or append the row.html() into table[i++]
19:12  nbari: ok let me try
19:12  danheberden: sveajobb: check out tmpl, the jquery template plugin
19:12  sveajobb: danheberden, thanks, I will do that :)
19:13  nbari: danheberden: sorry to ask but what or how to store in a jquery collection $( table )
19:14  danheberden: nbari - in the case of an array of elements,.. like var arr = [ document.getElementById('something'), document.getElementById('else') ];
19:14  nbari: for example if my table id='test' you mean to do something like $('#table').append('cloned.data') =
19:14  nbari: ?

19:27  ravenzz: nbari it shouldnt remove anything
19:27  ravenzz: what are you tring to do?
19:27  innociv: I keep getting "undefined" left in an array after I do something like delete array[1];.   like ["foo", undefined, "bar"] is left.
19:27  nbari: this: http://pastebin.com/vhjcCsZD
19:27  innociv: but when I do it on jsfiddle, it works fine :/
19:28  nbari: i clone a model html (table/rows)
19:28  nbari: and later parsed them and fillthem with the data
19:28  ravenzz: nbari jsdiffle.net's better.
19:28  innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/kz7e5/24/ oh no it *IS* doing it here.
19:28  ravenzz: wait
19:28  innociv: click "testname" and it comes up undefined in the list from that removeOption()
19:29  metaleks: is there a way to override a widget's internal method without having to recreate the widget by extending it?
19:29  japon: $("savvy licence aware").respond( could shortly explain without having to burrow through gpl, if i would be allowed to bundle jquery to another app, licenced BSD ?
19:29  nbari: I store the rows on array table[]
19:29  ajpiano: metaleks: $.ui.whatever.prototype._method = function() { } ?
19:30  ravenzz: nbari can u emulate ur script on jsdiffle.net
19:30  ravenzz: ?
19:30  nbari: ok let me try
19:30  ravenzz: k
19:31  metaleks: ajpiano, but won't that override every widget of type "whatever"?
19:31  ajpiano: yeah
19:31  ajpiano: you only want to do it for one?
19:31  metaleks: yes, sorry if I wasn't being clear
19:31  ajpiano: hm
19:31  ajpiano: well that's trickier
19:31  ajpiano: hm
19:32  ajpiano: what about like $("elem").data("widget').method = function() {}
19:32  ajpiano: ffuu
19:32  ravenzz: ajpiano gotta an iframe, how can i adjust his size on window resize?
19:32  ajpiano: like $("elem").data("dialog').method = function() {} for instance
19:32  nbari: http://jsfiddle.net/dzbdA/
19:32  nbari: there it is
19:32  ajpiano: ravenzz: ben alman has some plugins dealing w/ that shit
19:32  metaleks: ajpiano, I will give it a try, thanks
19:33  nbari: table[] contains all the rows properly formated : <tr><td>......</td></tr>
19:33  nbari: but now I just need to 'dump' table so I can show the table on the browser
19:33  danheberden: ajpiano: your favorite.. $.fn.clone!
19:33  danheberden: and lots of it
19:33  ajpiano: where
19:34  ajpiano: :/
19:34  ajpiano: omg
19:34 * ajpiano stabs
19:34  danheberden: haha
19:34  ajpiano: ?templating @ nbari

19:34  danheberden: i just told him/her of the names of what to check out
19:34  danheberden: but apparently clone won
19:34  ajpiano: clone sucks balls
19:35  danheberden: mm hmm
19:35  innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/kz7e5/26/ can someone explain why the removeOption() function is replacing things with "undefined" instead of actually deleting them?
19:35  nbari: currenlty checkin that thanks to danheberden info
19:35  OhaiBBQ: go to bed danheberden
19:35  danheberden: nbari: if for any reason, ajpiano's health and safety could use it
19:35  danheberden: OhaiBBQ: oh hai!
19:35  OhaiBBQ: 26 revisions.. wow
19:36  danheberden: OhaiBBQ: that's determination
19:36  ajpiano: innociv: when you delete from an array, that's what happens
19:36  JangKro: Is it possible to hava a javascript array of jquery objects e.g. NewArray = Array( $('#MYOBJ1'), $('#MYOBJ2') ); ?
19:36  nbari: also I tryied to use row.html() for storing all the html on the array but for an uknow reasson all the '<tr>' were trimed
19:36  innociv: ajpiano, how do I resolve it? replace the array with a duplicate that doesn't have that line?
19:36  sveajobb: JangKro, yes
19:36  innociv: or is there something easier?
19:36  danheberden: nbari: ya, but you're still cloning elements 'n stuff.. might be good to just re-create the html either yourself or using a template system
19:36  OhaiBBQ: hey!
19:36  ajpiano: innociv, use the technique here: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-array-remove/
19:36  OhaiBBQ: speaking of miketaylr
19:37  miketaylr: uh oh
19:37  JangKro: sveajobb, but is that syntax I just showed righT? bcs that's not working for me
19:37  OhaiBBQ: danheberden: yeah it is!
19:37  nbari: I had it work with out clonning but now I am just testing the .clone() for learniing more
19:37  nbari: is just that i am stuck pulling aut the data from the array
19:37  sveajobb: JangKro, just do like this;   NewArray = [ $('#obj'),  $('#obj2') ];
19:37  nbari: everything so far works just the 'last' steep
19:38 --- Multi_ is now known as Multi
19:38 --- Multi is now known as Multitallented
19:38 --- Dantman is now known as Dantman|Work
19:39  JangKro: svea ok thanks, it's working now i guess bcs I did not put "var" in front, maybe? hmm
19:39  ravenzz: ajpiano solved with a simple $(window).resize()
19:39  innociv: so then i can array.remove($.inArray(etc)); i guess?
19:40  JangKro: sveajobb, do all elements in an array need to be of the same type?
19:40  sveajobb: JangKro, not as far as I know, but I've never tried it ;)
19:40  JangKro: i.e. what about NewArray = [ $( '#myobj' ), 'abcdefd', $( '#myobj2' ).val()
19:40  vacho: http://pastebin.com/TBV6Wety
19:40  sveajobb: my best guess is that it works

19:42  dabear: dev2: what's your issue
19:42  dev2: where do I make the ajax call
19:43  Mafia: hi!
19:43  dev2: dabear: and how do I load the returned data into the dropdown
19:43  dabear: dev2: you either pass the url as the first parameter, or you can specify an array manually
19:43  Mafia: I have an image inside a div with overflow-y:scroll; is there anyway in jquery to hide that ugly scrollbar and make another one nicer?
19:43  dev2: ah and the url will  just work, automagically?
19:44  ProLoser|Work: hello

19:48  serio_: I don't know if any of these plugins work on iPhone.
19:50  Mafia: ok
19:50  Mafia: ;)
19:53  dabear: Mafia: the iphone implements scrolling differently
19:54  dabear: "First, let’s recap why fixed positioning does not work off-the-bat. Mobile Safari uses a viewport to show you websites. Imagine a book in front of you. Take a piece of paper, cut a 320×416 square in it, and lay it over the book. To read the book, move the paper around and position the hole over the words you want to see. This is exactly what Mobile Safari’s viewport is doing. "
19:55  serio_: If I'm not mistaken there are ways you can nab the iPhone scrolling events to make plugins like these work.
19:55  serio_: but yeah, usually you wouldn't want to do that.
19:56  serio_: touch events, rather
19:56  innociv: Awesome.  Now what do I do about array ordering?  I want to order based on a reference array, not alphabetically.  IE I have 10 items that go in a certain order(it's for a drop down menu), and when ones are added they need to be added to the position closest posible to the reference..

19:57  ancestral: Why would $('#container').width(); return null?
19:57  ancestral: (I have a div with id = "container")
19:58  serio_: probablly because it doesn't have a width
19:58  ancestral: But in CSS I have it set to 896 px
19:58  serio_: then you're doing something wrong
19:58  fission6: i have a simple jquery function that when a link is clicked it opens a popup by fading in, when i close the popup / modal it fadesout the div, i want to do the same functionality for images but i don't want to fade out when a user clicks the close button on the modal, how can i tell what tag an element is based off "this"
19:58  ancestral: Hmm
19:59  stanmancan: Is there any way to select all elements, including disabled ones ?
19:59  serio_: ancestral: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/4RTEa/
20:00  innociv: Oh god that is difficult :|
20:00  stanmancan: right now I have $("#id").contents('*').click(... but it's not working
20:00  stanmancan: Not on the disabled elements at least
20:01  cohitre: stanmancan: what do you want to do exactly?
20:01  stanmancan: cohitre: nothing by choice /endrantbeforestarting
20:01  cohitre: sounds like a good place to use event delegation.
20:01  stanmancan: Anyway, I have two divs, but the user can only check off elements in one and not the other
20:01  ancestral: serio_: http://mproud.com/wesnoth/bestiary/index.php?unit=gryphon
20:01  stanmancan: all check boxes
20:01  cohitre: just bind with $("#id").click and look at event.target inside the callback
20:02  stanmancan: cohitre: well when I do $("#id") and click on any child elements nothing happens
20:02  stanmancan: If I click on white space it works, but not on children
20:02  serio_: ancestral: I opened up console...
20:02  cohitre: do you have more than one element with #id ?
20:02  stanmancan: Nope
20:02  serio_: and typed: "$( '#container' ).width()"
20:02  stanmancan: They're all classes actually
20:02  serio_: and it returned '796'
20:02  stanmancan: That was my mistake earlier
20:02  ancestral: That's correct
20:03  ancestral: So why does my alert box not read it?
20:03  stanmancan: But regardless, only one of each
20:03  serio_: ancestral, you have to do document ready
20:03  serio_: you're calling that alert way to soon
20:03  cohitre: what do you want to do when they click on the checkbox?
20:04  serio_: $( 'document' ).ready( function() { alert("The width of div#container is: " + $('#container').width() + " pixels.") } );
20:04  ajpiano: 'document' ????
20:05  Cork[home]: that element will be a big funny trying to select :)
20:05  vacho: ajpiano: $("input#company_name").autocomplete({ source: ["c++", "java"] });
20:05  serio_: wait, what'd I do wrong again?
20:05  Cork[home]: *bit
20:05  ancestral: serio_: I did that and now no alert
20:05  vacho: how can I replace  ["c++", "java"] with a json call?
20:05  ajpiano: vacho: there are examples on how to do this on the jqueryui site
20:05  ajpiano: i am not going to sit here and type it out until you actually try
20:05  vacho: i tried it..coudnt get it to work
20:05  serio_: oh yah, drop the quotes, lol
20:06  ajpiano: vacho: i've tried it, done it, it does work.
20:06  ancestral: vacho: json_decode and json_encode?
20:06  ajpiano: sooo
20:06  stanmancan: cohitre: I want to enable all the checkboxes in the div they clicked on, and disable all the checkboxes in the other div
20:06  ajpiano: maybe show your attempt at what broke
20:06  ajpiano: or something
20:06  vacho: ajpiano: let me show u...1 sec
20:06  danheberden: for the record, i already mentioned autocomplete('option', 'source', newObj)
20:06  stanmancan: cohitre: I had it working perfectly with radio buttons, which is how it SHOULD be done, but management overrules common sense
20:06  serio_: ancestral: $( document )
20:06  serio_: not $( 'document' )
20:06  alexchan_1976: i am using validation plugin.  i am trying to figure out how to clear a text field, if the field is invalid . my jquery code is the following. http://pastebin.com/t8mUnGKC is there a method to this ?
20:07  cohitre: stanmancan: i see. give the same class to both of your divs and bind a .click element to both
20:07  serio_: thanks ajpiano for keeping me in line, heh

20:15  penmark: inside the mouseleave handler for an element, how can i check which element the pointer is inside?
20:15  rogerdoger: how can i determine if an <ul> is empty (doesnt have any <li> elements)?
20:15  dabear: var shouldPreventDefault = true; $(...).click(function(e){  if(shouldPreventDefault) { e.preventDefault();}  })
20:15  adoven: d4ft: shouldn't the href be /popups/show_popup.js?page=blah
20:15  danheberden: rogerdoger: check for length of children()
20:15 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
20:15  danheberden: $('ul').children().length
20:15  kelster75: rogerdoger: $('ul > li').length == 0
20:15  danheberden: or $('ul li').length
20:15  stanmancan: cohitre: I'm already more or less doing what you're suggesting, just on two different events instead of one: https://gist.github.com/700801
20:15  rogerdoger: ty
20:15  danheberden: kelster75's selector is the right one there
20:15  janthony: Cork[home]: I see. Is there any way to unescape in javascript in the data callback of the ajax?
20:16  danheberden: though getting one element and using children() is faster
20:16  rogerdoger: kelster75, how do i add an element selector to that, but also keep the ul>li structure?
20:16  Cork[home]: janthony: it should happen on its own, if your only escaping what needs to be
20:16  rogerdoger: #menu_list_<id> is the id for the <ul
20:16  danheberden: if that's your id
20:16  danheberden: its unique
20:16  rogerdoger: '#menu_list_'+id
20:16  danheberden: therefor, no element selector needed
20:17  keybo: so would that require another click of the button to remove the event listener or could it be done within the same click function if certain requirements are met?
20:17  rogerdoger: very true lol
20:17  d4ft: adoven: you are genius sir.  but now i am just getting the code from the partial
20:17  janthony: Well I have a form, where I typed in "Sunday's Paper" which was submited via ajax, but when it come back in the response and I added the response info to the DOM, it appeared as Sunday\'s Paper in the Dom.
20:17  d4ft: adoven: is there a way to render this as html
20:17  kelster75: right $('#menu_list_'+id+' > li') ... something like tht
20:17  Cork[home]: janthony: what are you using to generate the json?
20:18  Cork[home]: (and what are you using to add it to the dom)
20:18  cohitre: stanmancan: https://gist.github.com/700804
20:18  adoven: d4ft: the partial is an .erb template or whatever?
20:18  d4ft: yup
20:18  janthony: Cork: PHP's json_encode
20:18  janthony: Cork[home]: To add the dom, using jquery in the ajax callback.
20:19  Cork[home]: janthony: ya, but what function .html? .append?
20:19  janthony: Cork[home]: .prepend()
20:19  Cork[home]: k
20:19  penmark: how can i do the following? elm.mouseleave(function(e){ if (<pointer is not over a certain element>) {...} })
20:19  nbari: here is a litle example of what I am trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/dzbdA/5/
20:19  Cork[home]: janthony: could you pb an example of your json?
20:19  janthony: Cork[home]: sure.
20:19  adoven: d4ft: whats the extension on the .erb partial
20:20  d4ft: .html
20:20  d4ft: .erb
20:20  nbari: the only problme that I have is that all the cloned elements are stored on a table[] array
20:20  adoven: thats weird, the server is sending you back the template code?
20:21  nbari: if i store the row with something like table[i++] = row.html the page table is displayed but for an uknow reason all the <tr> are trimmed
20:21  nbari: the server only send the json data
20:22  janthony: Cork[home]: http://www.pastie.org/1300391 - have the ajax call, an excerpt from the script that is being called, and the firebug response
20:22  d4ft: adoven: no its rendered, but it just displays as txt
20:22  d4ft: instead of as html
20:22  nbari: later I clone the model table row and based on the number off rows i prase the server data and fill the rows
20:22  adoven: oh i understand, its coming back html encoded?
20:22  ajpiano: nbari: we are trying to make the point to you that that is a TERRIBLE METHOD OF TEMPLATING NEW ELEMENTS
20:24  nbari: Ok but that code just works and I just would like to know, why on the console.log i can see all the code working perfect
20:24  nbari: but when trying to fetch it out of the array it becomes trimmed
20:24  ajpiano: on which line of this stupid fucking fiddle
20:24  nbari: table[i++] = row;
20:25  Cork[home]: janthony: your Sunday\\'s Paper is dubble escaped, its something in your php code
20:25  ajpiano: what do you mean trimmed
20:26  d4ft: adoven: yes
20:26  Cork[home]: janthony: what is the content of $_POST['source'] in that php code snippet?
20:26  d4ft: adoven: how do i double check?
20:26  keybo: when i tried to unbind the click function, i get an error in the console stating too much recursion. can anyone explain what this means pls?
20:26  janthony: Cork[home]: "Sunday's Paper"
20:26  Cork[home]: janthony: your sure?
20:27  adoven: d4ft: i'd check the response in firebug, i dont think rails should be sending it back html encoded
20:27  stanmancan: cohitre: thanks. But still, when I click on the disabled checkbox, nothing happens, if I click anywhere else it works alright
20:27  cohitre: what should happen when you click on the disabled checkbox?
20:27  d4ft: adoven:  http://pastebin.com/LV0REuWe
20:27  d4ft: thats the response
20:27  KeeperOfTheSoul: doh, just looked at updating to 1.4 and found that val(undefined) no longer returns the value but sets it to undefined and returns a jquery selector
20:27  janthony: Cork[home]: yup. unde post in firebug it shows Source: Sunday's Paper
20:27  cohitre: should it be treated the same way as when you click the div?
20:28  Cork[home]: janthony: ya, but hve you done something like a var_dump($_POST['source']); ?
20:28  Cork[home]: *have
20:28  cohitre: do you have other events bound to that checkbox? they may be preventing the event from bubbling
20:28  danheberden: var_evacuate()?
20:29  stanmancan: cohitre: Here's a little video: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7322387/jing/2010-11-15_1428.swf
20:29  janthony: Cork[home]: nope
20:30  cohitre: stanmancan: that's how it should work, you can't check disabled checkboxes
20:30  Cork[home]: janthony: give it a try, it can be something like phps old auto encode thats hitting your
20:30  Cork[home]: *you
20:30  cohitre: if you only want them to look disabled then give them a css class
20:30  cohitre: and style them with css
20:30  janthony: Cork[home]: here is the full php script: http://www.pastie.org/1300413
20:30  adoven: d4ft: that looks right comin back from the server, maybe fancybox is html encoding it?
20:31  stanmancan: cohitre: Yeah but I need it to enable once I click on it, despite being disabled. I know it sounds retarded, and it is, but it's also not my choice
20:31  cohitre: yeah, when you click it then you toggle the css class

20:31  stanmancan: cohitre: I need it to  BE disabled so it's values doesn't get sent when the form is posted.
20:31  Cork[home]: janthony: check this http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.disabling.php

20:32  Driekus: guys, I'm a little stuck with a jQuery mobile implementation with Google Maps.. I hope I did use the jsfiddle website correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/k3Hdx/
20:32  cohitre: stanmancan: can you disable them on form.submit ?
20:32  Driekus: I think my problem is that I don't have the correct mobile event or something
20:32  Driekus: I want to load the Google maps in the #map_canvas
20:33  keybo: is there a way to programmatically replicate a .click ?
20:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: stanmancan: dont understand, why do they need to be selectable if they arn't submitted?
20:33  Brodingo: ajpiano :D
20:33  stanmancan: cohitre: I guess that's possible but it would be a PITA to figure out what value was changed last
20:33  ajpiano: Brodingo :D
20:34  ajpiano: Brodingo: cash that cheque baby
20:34  Brodingo: done and done
20:34  cohitre: stanmancan: use css classes to determine which one is enabled
20:34  Brodingo: on my iphone while i waited for 2 hours at the dmv
20:34  d4ft: adoven: it does indeed.   Any ideas on how avoid/fix this?
20:34  adoven: no sorry, haven't used fancybox before
20:35  cohitre: give them an "enabled" class when you click on one of the divs, use this class in the CSS to style the checkboxes to look disabled
20:35  Cork[home]: janthony: i don't know to much about wordpress, but i would start by looking at the $_POST variable so its not already escaped there
20:35  cohitre: on form.submit do $("div:not(.enabled) :checkbox").attr("disabled", "disabled")
20:36  stanmancan: cohitre: ah, true
20:36  stanmancan: cohitre: thanks
20:36  KeeperOfTheSoul: stanmancan: why not just use javascript to uncheck the other checkbox if the user checks one in the other group?
20:37  keybo: Is .trigger() a way of executing a .click() function without actually clicking anything?
20:37  KeeperOfTheSoul: stanmancan: ah, never mind, I kind of see what you're after, but as a user that would make no sense to me
20:38  KeeperOfTheSoul: stanmancan: is it just because management didn't like the way radio buttons look? I mean if they were made more like tabs which show/hide the checkboxes would that work?

20:41  keybo: is it possible to replicate the click of a button using the trigger function or can trigger only be used to execute javascript that would normally be executed on click
20:42  Phrogz: keybo: .click()
20:42  Brodingo: click() only executes bound events
20:42  Brodingo: it doesnt not simulate a user click
20:43  Brodingo: and my that shitty grammar i mean it doesnt simulate a user click
20:43  Brodingo: brb chopping my hands off
20:43  Phrogz: Sorry, I was meaning DOM Level 2 HTML .click()
20:43  keybo: is there a way of simulating a user click on a button?
20:43  Phrogz: Not jQuery .click()
20:44  janthony: Cork[home]: I got it. Looks like WordPress was hijacking my $_POST headers, so it was auto escpaing everything. I just added stripslashes() around my $_POST stuff on the php script.

20:52  serio_: cept ajpiano, he reached the end of the internet yesterday
20:52  Driekus: supsup, dabear, nvm got it working
20:52  Driekus: thx :)
20:52  serio_: just refer to .bind() when using .live()
20:52  keybo: i.e. $('#button').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); *other code* });
20:53  keybo: how can i unbind just the prevent default part of the click
20:53  serio_: ?details @ keybo
20:53  bot-t: keybo, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
20:53  dabear: keybo: you cannot
20:54  serio_: he needs to better explain what he's trying to do
20:54  vacho: ajpiano: I might just do another json call istead and get the data I need.
20:54  dabear: keybo: yo ucan do this: var shouldPreventDefault = true; $(...).click(function(e){ if(shouldPreventDefault) { e.preventDefault();} })
20:54  ajpiano: vacho: that's a really bad idea
20:54  dabear: but I told you that earlier
20:54  vacho: ajpiano: ya it does require more processing
20:54  ajpiano: adding another XHR call that every single user will have to experience every single time
20:55  dabear: so why didn't you follow my advice then?
20:55  keybo: i'm trying to validate a form on the client side in vb.net before i pass it over to the code behind, to do this i've prevented the default action of the button so i can run my validation script, now i need to be able to pass it over to the code behind when the validation pass
20:55  ajpiano: is a much worse solution than "you figuring out this API"
20:55  vacho: ajpiano: true..
20:56  fission6: how do i tell what $(this) is, meanign if its a or img tag
20:56  serio_: keybo, so, why on earth do you need to change e.preventDefault() to do that?
20:56  supsup: ajpiano perhaps he is making an app to deminstrate why you should not make redundent requests then it would be a really good idea ?
20:56  serio_: just send the data over to the backend using $.post after you've validated it like a normal person

21:00  danheberden: *strings
21:00  danheberden: like ${this.thingy}
21:00  gretagail: there's no key for the strings though

21:01  gretagail: ['name', type', 'etc']

21:01  danheberden: and iterate
21:01  josephsaliba: I dont want to use ajax

21:03  josephsaliba: ok pretend i only have one form
21:03  josephsaliba: ok never mind lol
21:03  danheberden: icek - no that's the whole thing.. on jqueryui.com you can build a custom js
21:03  josephsaliba: no no ... pff im confused
21:04  icek: danheberden Its just kind of hard for me to understand what i need to use because the souce has so much extra stuff in it
21:04  amh345: is there something i can use instead of replaceWith that doesnt involve me having to do ("#some_div").replaceWith('<div id="some_div">new value</div>')   ?
21:04  icek: danheberden is all i need the html and javascript?
21:04  josephsaliba: how can i post a form with jquery without using ajax?
21:04  SwiftOne: amh345: You can just use .html() to replace the contents.
21:05  danheberden: well the heard of one is $('whatever').click(function() { $(this).siblings().slideUp(); });
21:05  danheberden: so hop to it
21:05  ajpiano: josephsaliba: $("#yourform").submit();
21:05  amh345: SwiftOne: ah, perfect. thank you

21:12  josephsaliba: lol ajpiano
21:12  gretagail: I'm still getting [Object object] as the output of ${$value}
21:13  ajpiano: [Object object] means you aren't debugging hard enough
21:13  sean`: I'm so spoiled by chrome
21:13  gretagail: well I'm still a little new...
21:14  gretagail: "debugging hard enough" isn't exactly a helpful tip
21:14  ajpiano: what are you using to debug
21:14  ajpiano: alert statements?
21:15  sean`: Developers move as millions, survive as one
21:15  gretagail: I'm just trying to run the templates right now.  I have no debugging alerts
21:15  danheberden: gretagail: it should be in an object though, like tmpl( { header: header }) - then in your tmpl you can do {{each header}}
21:15  negev: so can i use ^= with a filter?  like .filter('^="someclass"') ?
21:16  danheberden: negev, why not?
21:16  danheberden: a css selector is a css selector
21:16  negev: im not sure about the syntax

21:23  sean`: document.getElementsByTagName('sean')[0].danheberden = 'YES BABY';
21:23  Cork[home]: negev: $('a,span').not('.myclass') or $('a:not(.myclass), span:not(.myclass)')
21:23  danheberden: mmmm
21:24  negev: but that isn't what i want to do
21:24  Cork[home]: ok?
21:24  negev: i want to match elements that /do/ have a class that starts with 'test'
21:24  SwiftOne: negev: Keeper's right on the money
21:24  negev: Keeper?
21:24  negev: ^= being starts with, rather than !=
21:24  SwiftOne: negev: <KeeperOfTheSoul> negev: '[class^=...]' don't forget that class is an attribute
21:25  Cork[home]: negev: class isn't meant to be used like that, add another class instead
21:25  ravenzz: using jquery ui tabs is possible to have the tabs label on bottom
21:25  WebDragon: is json allowed to contain internal comments like { "foo": "bar", // comment... \n  "baz" : "moredata" }
21:25  Cork[home]: negev: ^= means the string should start with is, not that "a class in the attribute should have it"
21:25  ravenzz: ?
21:26  fission6: is it bad to have mulitple $(document).ready(function() { or should they al be combined into one
21:26  negev: well it works for id or name
21:26  SwiftOne: negev: so filter('[class^=...]) works, so long as you have only a single class involved.  (multiples can break since they'll not necessarily be at start of string)
21:26  negev: why is class any different?

21:58  evan_luck: nbari: you can store it as a string and use eval but that's probably not a good idea
21:58  nbari: why ?
22:00  evan_luck: because eval can be used to execute any sort of code by a malicious coder... just generally not something to use
22:00  evan_luck: not real likely but ya know
22:00  evan_luck: spooky none the less
22:00  nbari: oh ok
22:01  snover: how about because eval is also slow as hell
22:01  serio_: I think that's the main reason why nobody uses it
22:01  snover: it ruins the ability for the browser to perform any JIT
22:01  serio_: it's way too taxing
22:02  evan_luck: yeah that's very true
22:02  snover: Also “you can store it as a string and use eval” makes no sense
22:02  snover: I mean, it makes like
22:02  evan_luck: snover: can't you store arbitrary code in a string and run eval on that variable?
22:02  snover: a very small amount of sense
22:02  snover: but mostly not
22:03  ajpiano: it doesn't make any sense in a conversation about conditional code execution in javascript :p
22:03  snover: A function declaration is a function “stored in a variable”
22:03  snover: function literal*
22:03  Gambaroni: Do you know of any free to use content slider javascript?
22:03  evan_luck: hmm... oops ;)
22:04  serio_: Gambaroni, define content slider?
22:04  evan_luck: Gambaroni: Anything Slider - http://css-tricks.com/downloads/
22:04  gf3: NO U
22:04  gf3: USE FLASH
22:04  serio_: <marquee></marquee> is free
22:04  serio_: and awesome \m/
22:04  evan_luck: hahaha
22:05 --- squiggy|food is now known as squiggy
22:06  serio_: next template I do up, I'm just gonna wrap the whole page in <marquee> and send it off like that.
22:07  KAACH: lol
22:07  Gambaroni: serio HAHA! not marquee.. but something like marquee, yes
22:07  daninmass_: not sure if this is the right place but her goes. I'm using a jquery .ajax call to submit for data to an ASP page. I was wondering there is a way to use the success callback function to display data from the .asp page?
22:08  serio_: that's how you do it, success( data ), where data is what is coming from the backend
22:09  philk_: how do I select a tr with "data-id=1234" and all its preceding rows that have the class ".pause". Can I do it in one selector?
22:10  nlogax: i don't think so. you can select it and do prevAll(".pause").andSelf() tho
22:10  philk_: $('[data-id=' + id + ']', $tableBody).remove() will only remove the specified row but I also want to remove all previous rows with a class attribute of "pause"... so
22:10  nlogax: iirc
22:10  SwiftOne: daninmass_: The html of the result page is passed to the success callback.
22:11  philk_: nlogax: I will try, thanks
22:11  SwiftOne: danimass_: You can use Jquery to help parse it too: success: function(html){ $(html).find(".someexampleclass").text(); }
22:11  daninmass_: hmm
22:13  serio_: success: function( data ) { console.log( data ) };
22:14  wils: hi, I am performing an AJAX call using $.post() I have 500k of response data from this request and then my browser is always displayinf a popup about timeout. How could I deal with this? setTimeout()?
22:14  philk_: nlogax: hmm this deletes far too many rows :)
22:14  monk12: anyone have a certain UI way to choose order? one option i thought is drag n drop selections in a list. but i was curious for other methods (other options for short amount of options, and long options)
22:14  philk_: wils: I would like to know that too :) Have to parse such massive docs too and the browser becomes unresponsive
22:15  wils: philk_: crazy êh?
22:15  serio_: why so much data?
22:15  Gambaroni: evan_luck there is none that looks like marquee there..
22:15  philk_: wils: yeah but my target browser (IE6, YEAH I KNOW IT SUCKS) does not display any message of timeout it just quits responding and updating the UI
22:16  wils: philk_: so bad!
22:16  evan_luck: Gambaroni: haha yeah... is that not what you were looking for? you scrolled down to 'Anything Slider' yeah?
22:17  evan_luck: philk_ & wils: you guys encoding your responses in JSON or XML or something? sending back a whole HTML document might not be necessary
22:17  Adamantus: I'm just trying to create a text field and append it to a div but it won't appear. I've duplicated stuff before but not created:  http://pastebin.com/fTr0TuDg
22:17  tom2strobl: hi guys! probably a quick one: I have a label with a higher z-index than the input, when I enter text to the input it sets the opacity of the label to 0, which works, but it would be a lot better if the z-index of the label changes below the input. I did this and with the developer mode it says z-index label 1, z-index input 2, but still the label is above the input. Is there something like restacking needed?
22:17  Gambaroni: evan_luck ah, a bit, but it should more be like a row that scrolls, so you see several images at the same time
22:17  wils: evan_luck: In my case it's a list of emails comma separated...
22:17  evan_luck: Gambaroni: check out http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html
22:17  philk_: evan_luck: its XML yes... the parsing is going fast though... just the UI building takes forever
22:17  evan_luck: wils: wow, that's a lot of emails ;)
22:18  philk_: evan_luck: Like building a table from the XML data
22:18  wils: evan_luck: yeah, It's!  :D
22:18  evan_luck: philk_: yeah makes sense... you're building the table as a string and only hitting the DOM once right?
22:18  daninmass_: perfect! god i love you guys :)
22:18  philk_: evan_luck: of course :)
22:19  philk_: evan_luck: I am using all tricks known to jQuery men
22:19  SwiftOne: Admantus: your new html doesn't get stuck anywhere visible in the document.
22:19  philk_: evan_luck: I have not tried the array.join trick though
22:19  innociv: .. why for $.each and $.map is one having index first and item 2nd, and the other vice versa? lmao :/
22:19  evan_luck: philk_: hmm I dunno then man... sounds like it's just a little too taxing :/
22:19  Gambaroni: evan_luck yeah something like that, is it possible to get that to scroll more like smooth and not one step at a time? :)
22:19  SwiftOne: Adamantus: You're appending to another newly created element, and neither one is displayed.  What do you want to append it to?
22:20  evan_luck: Gambaroni: check out the docs, it's really customizable
22:20  philk_: nlogax: prevAll(".pause") just deletes every pause row... but I only want those deleted until the next without the pause class set
22:20  Adamantus: SwiftOne: Yeah I see that, if I just create another step inside div and then append then?
22:21  philk_: evan_luck: yeah I know... i tried every optimization... i think its just the renderer of IE6 that is so fucked up
22:21  evan_luck: philk_: yeah, IE6 has a hard time with JS... it is pretty old after all :)
22:21  SwiftOne: Adamantus: Maybe...you've got a lot going on there.  I'd say create the div and input all in one go, and append that to something in your dom.  If you're using a recent version of Jquery there are some nifty shortcuts to create a bunch of DOM elements.
22:21  nlogax: philk_: oh. are they all before the selected row? no other rows between? then you can use prevUntil
22:22  philk_: evan_luck: but its working relatively good (on Windows CE its a slightly more updated version of IE6)
22:22  philk_: nlogax: no other rows between them
22:22  tom2strobl: It seems like setting z-index with jquery doesnt work, is there a restack command or something similiar?
22:22  Adamantus: SwiftOne: Can I do it separately? For example, newInput.appendTo() I assume so anyway.
22:22  evan_luck: philk_: what about doing the DOM insertion in chunks with a delay? try and break the big work out into smaller pieces?
22:23  markedwords: I'm seeing a "TypeError: Result of expression 'a.attributes' [null] is not an object." error with 1.4.4 that does not show up with 1.4.3.  Does anyone know of problems with 1.4.4?
22:23  SwiftOne: Adamantus: Oh yes, you can, I'm just trying to reduce to the simplest case.
22:23  nlogax: philk_: then something like prevUntil(":not(.åause)").andSelf().remove(); or if you have another class on them that you can use instead of the ugly :not
22:23  Gambaroni: evan_luck looks like it should be possible. that one is free for commercial usage as well?
22:23  jitter: check #7500
22:23  evan_luck: Gambaroni: not sure what the license is but you can check the source
22:23  monokrome: Hmm... Does position().left not work in IE?
22:23  SwiftOne: Adamantus: Because you're doing some animation steps in there and I have no idea when they will happen.
22:24  serio_: Gambaroni, you could just write what you're describing in jQuery from scratch quite easily.
22:24  jitter: ? #7500 @ markedwords
22:24  bot-t: markedwords, [#7500] attr() fails for non DOM element nodes (open bug) - http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/7500
22:24  Adamantus: SwiftOne: Jquery is so confusing. At first it's like oh this is easy then the learning curve turns into a vertical ascent.
22:24  serio_: or plain javascript for that matter.
22:24  Gambaroni: serio_ really?
22:24  monokrome: This doesn't seem to get position().left properly in IE... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/291753/
22:24  SwiftOne: tom2strobl: z-index can be set with Jquery, unless you have things like how IE6 will ignore z-index sometimes.
22:25 --- perlite_ is now known as perlite
22:25  markedwords: jitter: that might be it.  So I guess I'll wait for 1.4.5?
22:25  SwiftOne: Adamantus: Trust me, it's fine, just don't try to do everything in one line.
22:25  SwiftOne: Adamantus: First create the HTML you want.  Once that's working add the animation.
22:25  tom2strobl: SwiftOne: develope console tells me element is above another, but its still the other way. maybe the negative margin causes problems...
22:26  Gambaroni: evan_luck NO COPYRIGHTS OR LICENSES. DO WHAT YOU LIKE.
22:26  Aristata: danheberden:  Hi, you answered my question above (getting the value of a select tag). That's how I am doing it, and it works correctly in all browsers with the exception of Firefox, that's what I am inquiring about.
22:26  danheberden: ?p @ Aristata
22:26  bot-t: Aristata, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
22:26  evan_luck: Gambaroni: there ya go :)
22:26  jitter: markedwords: yep.
22:26  Gambaroni: evan_luck and then some more licences, Released under the MIT, BSD, and GPL Licenses.

22:26  davertron: I'm using jquery ui's dialog class. I have a weird situation (in firefox and chrome) where the dialog becomes stuck to the mouse after dragging. Basically, I click on the title, and drag the dialog around. When I unclick and move around, the dialog continues to move around near the mouse (not directly underneath it, but it looks like it's offset in the y direction based on my mouse position). Any ideas?
22:27  Gambaroni: evan_luck is that ok ? :P
22:27  jedimind: i have 4 items per row in a UL, and i want to target all 4 elements to do something based on one (any one in the index of 4 at a time) being clicked
22:27  evan_luck: Gambaroni: i'm no lawyer but judging from their initial comment in there, ya. it should be fine
22:27  jedimind: so if i click on #7 i want 5,6,7,8 to do something
22:27  jedimind: and if i click 11, i want 9,10,11,12 for example
22:28  markedwords: jitter: thanks.  Its unclear from that bug if 1.4.3 is also problematic, but it works on my end.
22:28  evan_luck: jedimind: something like $(this).parents('ul').find(YOURELEMENTS).doSomething() ???
22:28  ajpiano: evan_luck: that barely even qualifies as help
22:28  ajpiano: lol
22:29  evan_luck: hahaha
22:29  jedimind: lol
22:29  ajpiano: jedimind, what if you click on the first or last elements
22:29  ajpiano: then you'd want the three next / three prev?
22:29  jedimind: correct
22:29  evan_luck: siblings?
22:29  Adamantus: SwiftOne: I have it working without animation
22:29  jedimind: so sets of 4, any one of the 4 triggers the same thing for all 4
22:29  snover: markedwords: 1.4.3 doesn’t work properly either. In any case you should not be calling attr on non-dom objects
22:29  ajpiano: ohh... sets of four
22:30  jedimind: so i mean i can w/ relative ease grab current index and do a matrix after dividing by 4 to determine in what position it's in based on remainder
22:30  ajpiano: so it's not like a click on 3 gets you 1234 and a click on 4 gets you 2345 ?
22:30  jedimind: and then have 4 potential cases
22:30  jedimind: ajpiano, no, sorry, it's always 1234, 4567
22:30  jedimind: so clicking in 4 will get you 1234
22:30  ajpiano: 1234,5678 ?
22:30  jedimind: err yeah
22:30  jedimind: sorry
22:30  jedimind: fuck maybe i dont even deserve help
22:31  jedimind: if i cant explain properly lol
22:31  monokrome: Not with that language :D
22:31  jedimind: haha
22:31  jedimind: touche
22:31  ajpiano: haaa i actualyl know exactly what oyu want
22:31  evan_luck: haha
22:31 --- bbttxu_ is now known as bbttxu
22:32  ner0x: If I'm using $.ajax and on success it's html, on error it's json, how do I deal with that? And what will the parameters to the success: and error: look like?
22:32  SwiftOne: Adamantus: THere you go!  Now just give it "style='display: none'" when you first create it and then add the slideDown animation effect
22:32  ajpiano: ner0x: jquery won't ever attempt to parse json on the error callback, you'll havet o parse it manually out of the responseText in the error callback
22:32  davertron: jedimind: do your li's or rows have ids with their index or something?
22:32  jedimind: ajpiano, so you know what i need but dont have any suggestions? :) or are you just holding out on me
22:32  jedimind: davertron, no, but it's easy to get .index() out of them
22:32  ajpiano: jedimind, gimme a sec, i just need to work it out
22:33  Aristata: danheberden:  http://jsfiddle.net/LfnFa/ is the jist of it, I am having trouble making that javascript fire though
22:33  Adamantus: SwiftOne: I just added a .hide.slideDown("slow"): http://pastebin.com/zvsFub2Q
22:33  fission6: anyone have a recommendation for form field verifcation on the client side
22:34  davertron: jedimind: because it seems like you just want an algorithm for figuring out which block of 4 you're in, and from there, you just iterate over the items in the block and call whatever you want on them
22:34  jedimind: right but there's no container around each set of 4, that'd be easy
22:34  SwiftOne: fission6: I like Validity()
22:34  davertron: jedimind: in other words, the tricky part seems to me to be the " i clicked 3, which block am i in?", which seems like something you'd be able to figure out with some clever modulo work
22:34  ner0x: ajpiano: How can I get in from inside the error: function( data ) { } ?
22:34  Aristata: danheberden: Oh I see I need to include jquery on there
22:34  jedimind: they're all within the same container
22:35  davertron: jedimind: or, when you output your li's, you set a class on the block of 4
22:35  rogerdoger: invalid object initializer        -   $('<input>').attr({'name': 'custom_title_'+id,
22:35  rogerdoger: wth?
22:35  davertron: jedimind: then you can grab the block easily with the class
22:35  ajpiano: ner0x: error:function(xhr) { jQuery.parseJSON(xhr.responseText);    }

22:35  ner0x: ajpiano: Thank you. :)
22:35  Aristata: danheberden:  http://jsfiddle.net/LfnFa/1/
22:36  jedimind: davertron, i can easily find out which row im in, what im having trouble with is figuring out which 3 other elements are on the same row and on which side of me, without creating 4 different cases
22:36  ner0x: ajpiano++ # Thorough explanations
22:36  ajpiano: jedimind i'm working on it btw
22:36  jedimind: i mean it's not hard to mod then setup 4 cases, just trying to avoid it if possible
22:36  jedimind: ajpiano, yeah appreciate it, i'm just thinking out loud at the same time :)
22:36  rogerdoger: invalid object initializer    whats that mean
22:37  SwiftOne: rogerdoger: PRobably means that JS can't figure out something you have between {}
22:37  jedimind: brb 2 mins
22:38  davertron: jedimind: it's trivial if you set up classes on the blocks as you output them, if you can
22:38  davertron: jedimind: then you just grab the class on the row you're on, and all the work is done
22:38  SwiftOne: rogerdoger: Check to see you don't have things like an extra trailing comma, etc.  The {} in your attr call creates an object on the fly, and here JS is failing to parse it (if I follow)
22:38  Ankabout: how do I toggle between two color styles of an element on click?
22:38  rogerdoger: it says $('<input>').attr({'name': 'custom_title_'+id,
22:38  rogerdoger: is the problem
22:38  jedimind: davertron, i dont have a container around each block of 4, otherwise this would be no problem
22:38  jedimind: they're all sitting within one single container, and i dont want to split them up
22:39  SwiftOne: Rogerdoger: Where is that in your code?  Because that is incomplete :)
22:39  davertron: jedimind: so you don't have li's or a dom element?
22:39  jedimind: i have one UL with x amount of LIs in it
22:39  jedimind: say 30-40
22:39  davertron: jedimind: right
22:39  davertron: davertron: so if your lis each have a class
22:39  SwiftOne: ? toggleClass @ Ankabout
22:39  bot-t: Ankabout, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
22:39  davertron: jedimind: which indicates what block you're in
22:39  rogerdoger: http://pastebin.com/LuZ3yRiW
22:39  rogerdoger: whole function
22:40  davertron: jedimind: it's easy
22:40  jedimind: oh i see what you mean
22:40  Ankabout: ah thanks SwiftOne
22:40  jedimind: on load, go 4 at a time and add a class for 4 at a time
22:40  jedimind: yeah i guess that could work
22:40  davertron: jedimind: yeah exactly
22:40  davertron: jedimind: then when you click one
22:40  jedimind: you just apply whatever change to the set of classes
22:40  jedimind: yeah
22:40  davertron: jedimind: you have the class on that element, so you get everything else with that class and you're done
22:40  ajpiano: yeah but that sucks!
22:40  ajpiano: BOORING
22:40  davertron: ha
22:40  ajpiano: :p
22:40  monokrome: hmm
22:40  jedimind: yeah i agree w/ aj a little on that :)
22:41  jedimind: find me something more exciting :)
22:41  monokrome: Actually it looks like width() has issues in IE
22:41  davertron: ha
22:41  rogerdoger: SwiftOne, http://pastebin.com/LuZ3yRiW is my whole function
22:41  davertron: jedimind: well do it with module math then, that's exciting :p
22:41  jedimind: haha
22:41  jedimind: brb again
22:44  monokrome: Does anyone know why a 480px wide element being passed to jQuery would return 0 for the width() method?
22:44  snover: yes
22:44  monokrome: Specifically only in IE
22:44  rogerdoger: are u using 1.4.4?
22:44  monokrome: snover: Why is that?
22:45  monokrome: 1.4.2
22:45  rogerdoger: monokrome, are u using 1.4.4??
22:45  rogerdoger: oh
22:45  snover: monokrome: use 1.4.4 and see if it works.
22:45  Kaapa: rogerdoger: is there any known issue with 1.4.4?
22:45  rogerdoger: http://blog.jquery.com/2010/11/11/jquery-1-4-4-release-notes/
22:45  rogerdoger: nh) .width() and .height() now report the width and height of hidden elements (#7225)
22:46  rogerdoger: The .width() and .height() methods no longer return 0 when inspecting an element hidden using ‘display: none’. To determine if an element is hidden, always use .is(‘:hidden’).
22:46  monokrome: The element isn't hidden.

22:49  icek: Does anyone know of any cool jquery plugin that lets me do like cool borders to replace how im doing this now:  www.hathol.com/test/test.php
22:49  snover: monokrome: don’t use 1.4.3 unless you like broken stuff
22:49  icek: the borders look kinda old fashion
22:49  philk_: are there any known leaks in 1.4.2 when using .remove(). It seems the used memory continues to go up when removing a lot of nodes
22:49  philk_: snover: yeah, 1.4.3 does not work at all here
22:50  SwiftOne: rogerdoger: You have a comma by "class" instead of a colon, line 15.
22:50  monokrome: works in 1.4.4
22:50  monokrome: so I will use that
22:50  snover: philk_: If you are using custom events in IE, they will leak
22:50  Adamantus: SwiftOne: What are these tricks you speak of?
22:50  snover: philk_: Unless you manually unbind them
22:50  monokrome: for some reason Google CDN doesn't say 1.4.4 is the latest hosted version, so I thought I was stuck with 1.4.3
22:50  monokrome: snover: why do they leak?
22:51  monokrome: oh, thought it might be an issue with expando properties
22:51  rogerdoger: doh!!
22:51  icek: Does anyone know of any cool jquery plugin that lets me do like cool borders to replace how im doing this now:  www.hathol.com/test/test.php
22:51  SwiftOne: Adamantus: I recommend reading "Pro Javascript Techniques" by Resig, but most quality JS books will have some. Like I said, most are already taken care of by Jquery.

23:07  Aristata: Ok guys, I can't for the life of me figure this out. If someone would take a moment to open this page:   http://leninja.myshopify.com/collections/all    and in each Firefox and Chrome enter this in the terminal:  alert(jQuery('form').eq(0).find("select").val());      why won't firefox say "Product Options"????? Message me for the site password. I would really appreciate some feedback here.

23:17  Aristata: disappearedng:  css3
23:17  disappearedng: but I want the words to be displayed like 90 rotate right

23:18  vacho: a tricky one... I am using jquery autocomplete and I am pushing the selected value using: suggestions.push(val.name + " - " + val.address); .... how can I make so that when the user select a suggestion it only populates the val.name variablee?
23:18  Aristata: css3 can turn them to the right
23:18  Aristata: I just made this site: finchbeer.com
23:18  Aristata: the tabs on the right are css3
23:19  disappearedng: wow this is nice
23:19  disappearedng: where are your tabs

23:20  jwbuzz: How can I select an adjacent <span> to an item if I know the name.  for example, I have an onclick event and I user alert(this) which gives me the span object but I need to clone a span that's next to this but not a child
23:21  disappearedng: Aristata what guide do you follow?
23:21  Aristata: I am not sure, I think I just googled css3 rotating elements
23:22  Aristata: -webkit-transform: rotate(90deg);
23:22  Aristata: was pretty much all it took
23:22  Aristata: and ie:   filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=1);

23:46  Aristata: http://leninja.myshopify.com/collections/all  password: dev . Running this code alert(jQuery('form').eq(0).find("select").val());  works fine in EVERY browser but Firefox, what do I need to change?
23:46  rchern: what errors are in the console? where in the chain does it break?
23:46  coldhead: cool password bro
23:46  Aristata: ...thanks?
23:47  danheberden: Aristata: just a heads up $('form') is giving you every form element in FF
23:47  danheberden: and don't run alert, run console.log
23:47  Aristata: and .eq0 is giving me the first in the array
23:47  Aristata: I have run log
23:47  danheberden: Aristata: run $('form')
23:47  Aristata: I am just alerting for demonstrations sake
23:47  danheberden: console.log( jQuery('form') );
23:48  Aristata: danheberden:  Run console.log(jQuery('form').eq(0);
23:48  danheberden: ugh, you aren't listening
23:48  Aristata: I don't understand then
23:48  Aristata: I have run every stop in that chain
23:49  Aristata: The only one that returns what I don't want is .val()
23:49  Aristata: It should be "Product Options" like in EVERY other browser but Firefox
23:49  rchern: You didn't mention that.
23:49  Aristata: Instead it returns undefined
23:49  danheberden: someting in your markup is effed
23:49  danheberden: http://gyazo.com/96e8342a5578aa852187f1cb07609abf.png
23:49  rchern: and you never saidwhat it DOES do.

23:49  Third3ye: $('#eForm div').addClass('loading').css("width:", $("#eForm fieldset").outerWidth()); <-How do I get this mess to work :S
23:49  coldhead: Aristata: consider using a more robust way of finding your select
23:49  Aristata: If it were my markup I hardly think it would run everywhere else
23:49  danheberden: 'form' is getting the select element itself
23:49  coldhead: $('form select') ?
23:50  coldhead: $('form.someparticularclass select')
23:50  Aristata: That's because I have MANY forms
23:50  coldhead: right
23:50  Aristata: And this needs to happen for each one
23:50  Aristata: The actual code is:
23:50  coldhead: well it won't when you use eq
23:50  danheberden: so form#[object HTMLSelectElement] doesn't capture your attention in sthe least
23:50  ang3lx: can someone give me a little reply?problem is this:  I load a page with load("somepage.php #divbox") and in this #divbox there is some javascript as slider and cufon-yui...but this not work. what can I do to run javascript in a page loaded with load()?
23:51  danheberden: ang3lx: use the callback of the load call
23:51  danheberden: ?load
23:51  bot-t: .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
23:51  danheberden: umph
23:51  coldhead: ang3lx: getScript or the callback
23:51  Aristata: http://pastie.org/1301039
23:51  danheberden: ?$.load
23:51  bot-t: danheberden, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
23:51 --- Soothsayer_ is now known as Soothsayer
23:51  danheberden: so like .load('url', function() {  /* do stuff here on the new data /* });
23:52  Aristata: danheberden:  No dan, it doesn't
23:52  Aristata: Because I have been fucking with this for hours
23:52  Aristata: and I am beyond frusterated
23:52  danheberden: ok.. i'm just saying, when i do $('form') - i expect only form elements
23:52  danheberden: not HTMLSelectElements
23:52  danheberden: that's all
23:52  ang3lx: uhm, I must not reload script in loaded page?
23:53  ajpiano: Aristata what is jQ(selectors.'form[action*=/cart/add]')
23:53  danheberden: the scripts already there, ya? ang3lx ?
23:53  ajpiano: are you trying to use PHP concatenation operator
23:53  ajpiano: instead of javascripts?
23:53  Aristata: danheberden:  Will you please look at my pastie, that is the actual code that is running
23:54  Aristata: ajpiano:  let me edit
23:54  ang3lx: page loaded through .load() has same javascripts of parent page
23:54  coldhead: you may edit
23:54  compaq: How can you change href with autofil for a input box?
23:54  ang3lx: but, I think that are not actived when i call it with .load()
23:55  Aristata: ajpiano:  There I updated it
23:55  Aristata: http://pastie.org/pastes/1301039/edit
23:55  Aristata: http://pastie.org/1301039
23:56  Renacor: anybody know of a good example that implements resizing elements via dragging them with the mouse?
23:56  ajpiano: Aristata: and how is the code not working?
23:56  Aristata: Every select has a default of "Product Options"
23:57  Aristata: If that is selected, it should make the error appear telling you to select one
23:57  Aristata: if select.val() == "Product Options" then error
23:57  ajpiano: so it's not hitting that condition
23:57  Aristata: selevt.val() works in every **(&^*^ browser but firefox
23:57  Aristata: where it is getting undefined
23:57  ajpiano: are you sure it's finding an element ?
23:58  Aristata: I just need to know how the hell to make that fking value come through with firefox
23:58  Aristata: Positive
23:58  ajpiano: a live demo would really help
23:58  Aristata: I have tested every element in that chain
23:58  danheberden: Aristata: console.log( jQ(e.target).find('select') );
23:58  danheberden: that shows you the select elem in console?
23:59  danheberden: or whatever that call is
23:59  snover: Aristata: Are you using jQuery 1.4.4?
23:59  Aristata: I can't count how many times I have posted this
23:59  Aristata: http://leninja.myshopify.com/collections/all  password: dev . Running this code alert(jQuery('form').eq(0).find("select").val());  works fine in EVERY browser but Firefox, what do I need to change?
23:59  ajpiano: Aristata: btw, what is the name attribute of the element
23:59  danheberden: (he also has a form name=id
23:59  danheberden: )
23:59  danheberden: the select is name=id
23:59  Aristata: It's all there
23:59  Aristata: Every bit
23:59  danheberden: 1.4.3
23:59  ajpiano: Aristata: upgrade to jquery 1.4.4
