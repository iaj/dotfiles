01:27  ARRGGHH: I tried something similar, but it makes all Divs with the class visible, I basically have $click.function on the a, and need to show it's b
01:27  ARRGGHH: but there are many a's :(

01:39  ARRGGHH: @coldhead - ok, it works at Jsfiddle, I have no idea what I have done wrong, but I will try to find out :S
01:40  coldhead: good luck, ARRGGHH
01:40  coldhead: it will be something really simple
01:40  ARRGGHH: Many thanks, what you said worked. However, when would you use the " > " operator, I was trying for ages to use "a > b" or similar as I thought it was a child div :S
01:41  coldhead: > means IMMEDIATE child
01:41  hsbot:   Not in scope: `means'Not in scope: data constructor `IMMEDIATE'Not in scope: `child'
01:41  coldhead: if you leave it out you can have any number of elements in between
01:41  coldhead: like a foo aids lol bar a
01:41  coldhead: a bar will match that bar, a > bar won't
01:42  coldhead: but a > foo will match foo
01:42  coldhead: capiche?

01:58  coldhead: and something oppositey for .blur()
02:06  TechIsCool: do i just get ignored or do people not know
02:07  ARRGGHH: @Coldhead GOT IT WORKING! My stupid fault
02:07  ARRGGHH: Thanks so much for the help
02:08  ajpiano: TechIsCool, it's blowing up in the middle of the jquery mobile file,
02:08  ajpiano: so i'm inclinded to think it's some sort of bug in jqm
02:09  TechIsCool: ok
02:09  TechIsCool: :(
02:10  TechIsCool: i did not even see that it was erroring out sorry
02:17  icekk: Hey does anyone have any advice on how I can better handle the pagepeel hover effect with the pagepeel wave in the wind wobble effect?  heres the code http://hathol.com/test/javascript/jquery.animation.js  here is the demo  http://hathol.com/test/index.php  It produces weird behavior and I was wondering if anyone had any advice
02:23  coldhead: TechIsCool: don't think you were being ignored, its just that people are often already helping people here and in other channels, so its okay to ask again until you get attended to
02:24  Vorspire: just dont spam :P
02:25  coldhead: just stop spamming when people complain*
02:25  Vorspire: xD
02:26  Vorspire: (icekk): I think the hover event(s) are firing on the elements at different times, maybe you forgot to stopPropogation somewhere, but maybe that's why it looks funny
02:27  Vorspire: (icekk): also, I would recommend shrinking before expanding, expanding then shrinking would look odd too
02:30  TechIsCool: coldhead: yah i understand its irc
02:30  icekk: hey vorspire, the conflict comes when i call the wobble code from within the pagepeel code, the wobble code itself is good but what i cant figure out is how to smoothly get the wobble effect to work once again after the pagepeel expand /shrink code has ran
02:30  coldhead: TechIsCool: cool man, just didn't want you to be discouraged
02:30  icekk: because the pagepeel expand/shrink code stops the wobble code, which is good, until the pagepeel is done
02:30  Vorspire: (icekk): i've been working on a proper .wobble plugin :P
02:31  icekk: hehe oh yea?
02:31  Vorspire: yeah, but it's not finished
02:31  icekk: When did you start/
02:31  Vorspire: i can give you the fiddle for it though
02:31  icekk: cool
02:32  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/CEkP3/
02:32  Vorspire: I'm still having problems restoring the original position of the element after the effect has finished
02:34  icekk: hey vorspire, this is cool, but i think the pagepeel code will still turn it off, what i need to figure out is how to get the wobble to turn back on when the pagepeel hover effect is done
02:35  icekk: if you check http://hathol.com/test/javascript/jquery.animation.js you will notice i just attached wobble as a call back to when the hover effect finishes, but this infinite type loop can cause problems when you try to hover again
02:36  Vorspire: yea, that's wy I had to use my TimerXAC plugin to rationalize the recursion
02:36  Vorspire: ?TimerXAC
02:36  bot-t: Vorspire, TimerXAC 1.0.3-VN-RC | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/content/timerxac-103-vn-rc
02:37  icekk: so that wobble effect plugin you are working on uses the Timerxac?
02:38  icekk: vorspire
02:38  Vorspire: yes
02:38  hyperstream: how do i do, function bleh(Something,Something="") { //do stuff } so i can use, bleh(somethin) or bleh(something,second)
02:38  icekk: cool vorspire, i will try to use that wobble plugin ur working on
02:38  icekk: :D
02:39  Vorspire: it's a bit messed up atm, i'll let you know when it's stable
02:39  icekk: ok ok
02:39  icekk: are you working on it now?
02:43  Vorspire: (icekk): yea
02:45  Vorspire: Think I will need help fixing the positioning though, any takers?
02:49  temp01: hyperstream: you can do that without doing =""
02:49  hyperstream: temp01, oh thank you very much, too much C/PHP for me ><
02:50  hyperstream: temp01, much better, i ended up applying a letter in front of the 'Something' var, and did, if (Something[0] == "R") { //doo stuff } else { } lol
02:56  BMCouto: any idea why parseFloat(19,55*3) gives me 57 without the decimals?
02:57  Vorspire: doesn't parseInt take a string argument?
02:58  BMCouto: Vorspire: is that for me?
02:59  Vorspire: yes
02:59  BMCouto: parseInt(string, radix)
03:00  BMCouto: the thing is for the "3" i'm using parseInt() and for the 19,55 im using the parseFloat
03:00  Vorspire: ahh I see you said parseFloat not parseInt, sorry :P
03:00  BMCouto: to keep them as they are
03:00  BMCouto: but thats not happening
03:01  BMCouto: Vorspire: this is how i have it http://www.jsfiddle.net/EuuW4/

03:06  Vorspire: lol
03:09  BMCouto: Vorspire:
03:09  BMCouto: but i just want two decimals
03:09  BMCouto: its a cost
03:09  BMCouto: so i can only have like 19,55€
03:10  Vorspire: use Math.round
03:10  hyperstream: 19.55 ?
03:10  hyperstream: BMCouto, why are you using , as a decimal place?
03:10  hyperstream: point*
03:10  BMCouto: hyperstream: what do you mean?
03:11  Vorspire: ?eval var foo = '3'; var bar = '19,55'; var foobar = parseFloat( bar ) * parseInt( foo ); alert( foobar );
03:11  hyperstream: 19,55€ is invalid, 19.55€ would be valid? atleast when i went to school, we use dollars here though
03:11  bot-t: Vorspire: 57
03:11  Vorspire: that's why you're getting 57
03:11  Vorspire: hyperstream is right
03:11  Vorspire: dont use ,
03:11  Vorspire: use .
03:12  BMCouto: ok i see
03:12  hyperstream: its 1,900 = 1900 when you use ,- you are trying to use 19 , 55  i think you want 19 point 55
03:12  BMCouto: and them math.tound?
03:12  Vorspire: ?eval var foo = '3'; var bar = '19.55'; var foobar = Math.round(parseFloat( bar ) * parseInt( foo ), 2); alert( foobar );
03:12  bot-t: Vorspire: 59
03:13  BMCouto: vor
03:13  BMCouto: Vorspire: not like tha
03:13  BMCouto: i need the decimals
03:13  BMCouto: i need to achieve 58.65
03:14  hyperstream: correct me if im wrong, but in C/C++ a float is a number with decimal place. and int is a rounded number
03:14  hyperstream: Not sure if same applys in jquery/javascript
03:15  Vorspire: ?eval var foo = '3'; var bar = '19.55'; var foobar = Math.round(parseFloat( bar ) * parseInt( foo ) * 100) / 100; alert( foobar );
03:15  bot-t: Vorspire: 58.65
03:15  Vorspire: (BMCouto): there you go
03:16  BMCouto: Vorspire: will try
03:17  Vorspire: look at the result :P
03:17  Vorspire: it's exactly what you wanted lol;
03:17  BMCouto: Vorspire: yes but why multiplying to the divide?
03:18  Vorspire: that's what gives 2 decimal places
03:19  Vorspire: ?eval Math.round( (19.55 * 3) * 100 ) / 100;
03:19  bot-t: Vorspire: 58.65
03:19  BMCouto: and you need the math.round anyway?
03:20  Vorspire: yes
03:24  BMCouto: Vorspire: it works
03:25  BMCouto: but its not exactly what im looking
03:25  BMCouto: cause i can have like 79.1
03:25  hyperstream: lol
03:25  BMCouto: with just one decimal
03:25  BMCouto: and i want to always have the two
03:25  bonhoffer: i am looking to fix the show before hide problem . . . any favorite solutions . . . using jquery ui -- tabs
03:27  Vorspire: ?g "JavaScript Math.round"

03:28  Vorspire: you'll have to convert price to string and detect if it has no trailing 0, and add one
03:29  BMCouto: there's any function that i just can tell two always have the two decimals?
03:30  bonhoffer: looking at a css solution to hide everything first, then force js to reveal after everything has loaded
03:30  bonhoffer: don't want to slow things down and worried about cross-browser capability
03:36  bonhoffer: is this too boring or too hard to get any interest?
03:37  bonhoffer: i want to know if i should write this up when i solve it, since google doesn't seem to have much on this
03:40  hyperstream: BMCouto, do it Vorspire 's way, something like this:
03:40  hyperstream: ?eval var test = "59.1"; var temp = test.split("."); if (temp[1].length < 2) { temp[1] = temp[1]+"0"; } alert(temp[1]);
03:40  bot-t: hyperstream: 10
03:41  hyperstream: ?eval var test = "59.1"; var temp = test.split("."); if (temp[1].length < 2) { temp[1] = temp[1]+"0"; } alert(temp[0]+"."+temp[1]);
03:41  bot-t: hyperstream: 59.10
03:41  Vorspire: gj hyperstream
03:41  Vorspire: perfect
03:41  hyperstream: Yeah, just simple logic i guess lol
03:41  hyperstream: To much C ><
03:42  hyperstream: Doing stuff the manual hard way lol
03:42  hyperstream: bonhoffer, can you show me a working example of what is happening, or what is supposed to happen?
03:43  bonhoffer: yeah -- it is behind a p/w, but basically all content hidden by jquery-ui tabs shows very briefly, then is hidden after the content loads
03:44  hyperstream: bonhoffer, are you using ajax to load the content on tab select?
03:44  hyperstream: or its all preloaded?
03:44  bonhoffer: no, that is planned eventually -- all the content is there right now
03:44  bonhoffer: dynamically generated by ruby
03:45  hyperstream: bonhoffer, without a working example, i cannot help im sorry, need to see the issue visually and then view the code. Im sure there is a simple way of solving it
03:45  BMCouto: hyperstream: jus say it
03:45  BMCouto: thanks
03:45  hyperstream: BMCouto, sorry?
03:45  hyperstream: no problems.
03:46  BMCouto: ups
03:46  BMCouto: i meant
03:46  BMCouto: just saw it, thanks
03:46  BMCouto: lol
03:46  BMCouto: not say iy
03:46  hyperstream: hehe nps
03:46  ARRGGHH: I have a div that Toggles fine, but it is a few divs on a few lines - they hide perfectly well, but coming back only the first one animates then the rest just appear - I can't easily recreate on JSfiddle, but trying... just wondering if anyone knows why or seen something similar?
03:46  BMCouto: lol
03:46  bonhoffer: hyperstream: thanks, i'll try to solve, then get a blog entry up on it, otherwise i'll post a challenge example for the community
03:46  bonhoffer: thought this was a solved problem
03:46  hyperstream: bonhoffer, sounds great, drop me a link or so in pm :)
03:47  bonhoffer: hyperstream: will do
03:48  nezZario: Ok
03:48  nezZario: I'm trying to make a simple accordian, but I have an issue.. in all the examples it's like <h2>blah</h2><div>...</div> ... etc
03:48  nezZario: in my situation I have a wrapper <div> around the h2's
03:48  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, are the divs, that are in a line wrapped in a container? if so, hide that container, then make the container reappear.
03:49  nezZario: i'm doing that but i can't make it nice and smooth like the accordian
03:49  nezZario: I also only want one accordian at a time..
03:49  nezZario: err, one little tab open at a time
03:49  ARRGGHH: Sorry, I don't really understand :S The divs are visible but are in a container that is hidden...
03:49  ARRGGHH: it is the container I am toggling
03:50  nezZario: oh lol
03:50  rchern: $("#input").val("blah blah blah") results in the text being placed in the input, but the cursor being put at the beginning rather than the end. any way to avoid that?
03:51  BMCouto: ?eval var test = "59.1"; var temp = test.split("."); if (temp[1].length < 2) { temp[1] = temp[1]+"0"; } alert(temp[0]+"."+temp[1]);
03:51  bot-t: BMCouto: 59.10
03:51  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, need a working example to look at sorry, your description doesnt contain enough for a mental visual on it
03:51  BMCouto: hyperstream: how do i check if test has decimals or not?

04:01  nezZario: ok I see next()
04:01  nezZario: is there a before() ?
04:01  temp01: is there an api reference
04:02  temp01: is there a google
04:02  nezZario: well obviously there isn't a before()
04:02  nezZario: nor is there a previous()
04:02  nezZario: so maybe there is another word for "back"
04:02  nezZario: that I am unaware of
04:02  temp01: obviously
04:03  ARRGGHH: @hyperstream - I don't understand, works fine on JSfiddle, flakey on real - http://jsfiddle.net/FusGB/ ---- http://www.ezpcinternal.com/sports/index.html
04:03  temp01: you aren't looking hard enough
04:03  nezZario: if you don't know the answer, you could just not be a smartass
04:03  temp01: because there's a before
04:03  nezZario: there is no before()

04:04  temp01: yeah man, you need to check the api and google
04:04  nezZario: er next()
04:04  nezZario: ah whatever
04:04  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, cant access: Access to this server is forbidden from your client, but at a guess, id say you might have another event firing as well that is messing things up
04:04  temp01: if you go to api.jquery.com and start typing previous, you will find it
04:04  temp01: because it's named prev
04:04  temp01: but no
04:05  nezZario: ah indeed
04:05  nezZario: there is no drop down as I type temp
04:05  zjwalden: heh
04:05  ARRGGHH: @Hyperstream - sorry, just enabled access, please try again. AFAIK there is nothing else firing :S
04:05  zjwalden: type in prev
04:06  zjwalden: or .prev
04:06  zjwalden: and press enter
04:06  ARRGGHH: I'm going crazy over this! can't work it out :S
04:06  nezZario: yeah

04:07  nezZario: a backwards working accordian looks a lot better
04:07  ARRGGHH: On mine (Chrome) The first item slides down, but second-last just appear... when you click again, they disappear as expected
04:07  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, im using the latest chrome, on ubuntu linux, working good here
04:07  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, no instant stuff
04:08  nezZario: oh lol
04:08  nezZario: i didn't even notice it's ajaxing as I type
04:08  nezZario: I guess i type too fast
04:08  nezZario: :P
04:08  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, ooo, you click on it, slides down the first one then the rest display instant ?
04:08  ARRGGHH: Ok, that just sucks - Works fine on IE as well, just not on my Chrome
04:08  ARRGGHH: yeah
04:08  zjwalden: i love it when things ajax while i type.. heh

04:11  nezZario: uhhhhh
04:11  nezZario: well crap, is there anyway to scroll the window with jquery?
04:12  nezZario: I wish I could get a real accordian working.......
04:12  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, i dont understand why its doing that... it seems correct
04:12  nezZario: i'm spelling that wrong everytime
04:12  hyperstream: hold up
04:12  hyperstream: ARRGGHH, ok, instead of hide() use slideUp() (at the start)
04:13  nezZario: is there NO way to change accordion()'s .. which element it attaches it's click event to?
04:13  nezZario: it's attaching to h3's
04:14  ARRGGHH: @Hyperstream No difference :(
04:25  nezZario: this is pissing me off

05:08  goten6: temp01: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ (the flickr cat example)
05:08  hyperstream: Boudga, its because of position: absolute
05:08  temp01: goten6: json != jsonp
05:08  hyperstream: Boudga, if you use inspect element, and remove it from the sub ul, then hover it pushes it
05:09  goten6: x_x
05:09  hyperstream: Boudga, change to relative i believe
05:09  goten6: is there a way to make the data jsonp

05:09  Boudga: lemme try
05:09  Boudga: brb

05:09  temp01: goten6: yes, append ?callback=? to url
05:10  goten6: ok ill try
05:10  temp01: goten6: note that it only works when the server supports the parameter/json (in this case, it does)
05:11  jrockjiggz: vector_xyz: because i only have 1 field that is added to the dom, so would I add: var newFld = $('input[name=change]').value() ? or
05:11  Vorspire: otherwise, you'd have to do the cURL method
05:11  hyperstream: Boudga, looks odd if you hover 'Fresh Food' then hover all the way down to Coffee & Bev's
05:12  goten6: temp01 <3 it worked!
05:12  hyperstream: just all jumps as it should, but mouse is not over the coffee, no solution for that :P
05:12  goten6: temp01 thanks :)
05:12  jrockjiggz: vector_xyz: or do you mean $('form').live( function(){ document.form.submit; }); ?
05:12  temp01: jrockjiggz: live won't change anything

06:44  zef88: so how can I set a function to be executed every time something is appended to a div?
06:45  zef88: it will not lose focus as it is the div with the main content
06:45  OhaiBBQ: have a live demo? there might be an easier way to do it than what you're thinking of doing
06:46  Vorspire: (zef88): you can create a custom event and handler
06:46  zef88: :o
06:46  zef88: how??
06:47  Vorspire: ?bind
06:47  bot-t: .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
06:47  Vorspire: where eventType is 'your_event_name'
06:47  Vorspire: and then
06:47  Vorspire: ?trigger
06:47  bot-t: .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
06:47  Vorspire: with the same syntax
06:48  Vorspire: $('div').append( ... ).trigger('my_event_name');

07:15  styol: anyone aware of a plugin or have any suggestions for displaying a panoramic image in a panorama style, 360 click to drag from left to right essentially?
07:20  FLYBYME: dangerous use of the global this object at line
07:20  FLYBYME: why cant i use this.something?
07:23  fris: styol a few examples on this page http://webstandard.kulando.de/post/2008/11/28/best-of-jquery-tutorials-part-2
07:24  styol: fris: thanks :)
07:27  styol: fris: doh yeah ive tried the 2 jquery ones from here, and another one.. so far not so good hehe. this last one was pretty much the one, but the downloadable version doesnt work while the demo does http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel
07:27  styol: i mean it works, but the functionality is not the same. on the demo you can click and drag while the downloadable you have to click and drag, it doesnt move, and then if you move your mouse around it moves the image, and you have to click the image to stop hehe
07:28  styol: *have to release mouse otherwise it doesnt move
07:45  jedmund: anyone here familiar with bassistance's autocomplete plugin?

07:46  jedmund: i need to dynamically change the autocomplete but i'm not sure how, pretty much
07:46  jedmund: autocomplete data*
07:46  jedmund: but theres also multiple autocompletes on the page so I can't just change the variable data

08:01  Bisu[Shield]: any suggestions?
08:02  Bisu[Shield]: the ui datepicker is fine, problem is all the dates have the same color so users dont know that some dates have events
08:03  zef88: can anybody please spot the error here? http://pastebin.com/Q2wGHzYw
08:03  temp01: this isn't php
08:04  temp01: foo[] = is php syntax
08:04  zef88: i tried without the []
08:04  zef88: and didnt work either
08:04  zef88: actually i first had it without it
08:04  temp01: well, if you keep trying with [], it'll never work
08:04  temp01: also, that code is very inefficient
08:05  temp01: what error do you see in console
08:05  zef88: Firebug's log limit has been reached. 0 entries not shown.		Preferences	
08:05  zef88: detailed error: missing ) after argument list
08:05  temp01: what line number
08:06  zef88: isNaN(parseInt(elem.css('margin-bottom'))) ? 0 : parseInt(elem.css('margin-bottom')];
08:06  temp01: did you remove the []s?
08:06  zef88: let me change it to call parseint and elem.css less times
08:06  temp01: what do you have now? pastebin that
08:06  zef88: yes the only change i've made so far is taking the []'s away
08:06  temp01: so pastebin that
08:08  zef88: http://pastebin.com/H5rEryL6
08:09  temp01: what and on what line do you see the error now
08:10  zef88: missing ) after argument list
08:10  zef88: [Break on this error] isNaN(parse... parseInt(elem.css('margin-bottom')];\n
08:10  zef88: missing ) after argument list?
08:10  temp01: what's the error
08:10  zef88: that one
08:11  temp01: if it's missing ) then the real problem is not in the code you pasted
08:11  zef88: missing ) after argument list
08:11  temp01: check the code before that function
08:11  temp01: what comes before it - where are you defining that function
08:11  zef88: it seems it is, i just commented out that function
08:12  zef88: and it runs
08:12  temp01: that doesn't tell much
08:12  temp01: if you put a function definition somewhere where it's not allowed, it will throw error
08:12  temp01: but not if you comment it out
08:12  temp01: even if the function definition is valid
08:12  zef88: yes its inside <script> tag
08:12  zef88: not not inner another function or something
08:12  zef88: just directly inside <script>
08:13  temp01: is there _anything_ before it? even a variable definition?
08:13  zef88: yes there is lots of code
08:13  zef88: should i place tha function at the beginning of script?
08:13  zef88: the very first thing?
08:13  zef88: let me try that
08:14  zef88: ok done that, now the error moves to line 12
08:14  zef88: I beliieve that means the error is within the function :/
08:14  msimurin__: how can i select element by name attribute?
08:15  msimurin__: or by other attributes
08:15  msimurin__: is # only way?
08:15  progrock: within a function, can I re-assign this... ie. this=this.slice(1)
08:15  temp01: zef88: oh, I see it
08:16  temp01: you actually have missing )
08:16  temp01: foo ? bar : parseInt(elem.css('padding-bottom')];    <- no closing ) for parseInt
08:16  zef88: yes
08:16  zef88: LOL
08:16  zef88: damn
08:16  zef88: sorry for that one
08:16  temp01: it was hard to notice
08:16  zef88: thanks
08:16  zef88: and to optimize it
08:17  zef88: what would you do?
08:17  zef88: just dont call parseint twice for each property?
08:18  progrock: hmm, I take it I cantdo the above... or maybe I'm messing up somewhere else
08:20  temp01: zef88: what is your goal with that function
08:22  coldhead: tough question
08:24  zef88: well my goal is to set the outerWidth
08:24  zef88: i mean height
08:24  zef88: you know like $('#something').outerHeight()
08:24  zef88: returns the outerHeight but there is no way to set it
08:25  temp01: instead of repeating all the login in your code
08:26  temp01: you could do  elem.height( newHeight - (elem.outerHeight()-elem.height()) )
08:26  temp01: s/login/logic
08:27  temp01: .outerHeight(true)*
08:28  progrock: Can anyone help me figure out how to fix the second attempt: http://pastebin.com/8hVtGmVe
08:29  progrock: basically tryign to figure out how to write a function like $.fn.function()  instead of function(elem)
08:29  progrock: oh, wait
08:29  temp01: progrock: this will be one dom element not a jquery set
08:29  temp01: error console should tell you that
08:30  progrock: I think i got it.. $(this) not this
08:30  temp01: nope
08:30  temp01: .slice(1) will return nothing then
08:30  temp01: because it's still one element
08:30  progrock: oh, ok
08:31  progrock: so I'm shit out of luck getting it in the $.fn. form then, right?
08:31  temp01: no
08:31  temp01: do var set = this.eq(0)......
08:31  temp01: er
08:31  temp01: var set = this; this.eq(...) then use the set variable

08:34  progrock: thank you
08:35 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
08:35  progrock: I'm slightly confused out why the first one works then with elem
08:35  progrock: about*
08:36  temp01: because elem is the whole set
08:36  temp01: 'this' gets passed to the callback as dom element
08:37  progrock: yet set = this; makes set the whole set...
08:37  temp01: that's outside the callback
08:37  progrock: oh

08:39  Vorspire: pff, i'm using jsfiddle.net and i'm importing an external script, but what can i do to make it refresh the script it's using to the new code if i edit it?
08:39  temp01: jsfiddle doesn't cache, your browser does
08:39  Vorspire: because i make edits to the external script andthey won't change in jsfiddle, i tried clearnig the cache
08:39  temp01: so normal browser methods apply
08:40  temp01: open the fiddle by appending /show and press ctrl+shift+r
08:40  Vorspire: doesn't ctrl+f5 result in hardrefresh too?
08:40  Vorspire: well ill give that a shot too, ty
08:40  Bisu[Shield]:  I am looking for a calendar widget that looks like the datepicker for jquery ui where i can set dates that should be highlighted. any suggestions? the ui datepicker is fine, problem is all the dates have the same color so users dont know that some dates have events
08:41  Vorspire: temp01; still didn't work :/
08:41  temp01: in the add resources sidebar, open the script in new tab
08:41  temp01: do you see the old code or new?
08:42  Vorspire: old

08:46  Vorspire: i hate manually writing regex
08:46  temp01: n

08:46  coldhead: Vorspire: it might be more elegant to code up a pattern matching finite state machine

08:48  Vorspire: ahh haven't heard that termanology before, sorry
08:48  Vorspire: never liked regex enough to study it lol
08:48  coldhead: its a credit to regexps that you haven't need to know how they work
08:48  coldhead: needed*
08:48  Vorspire: i mean, i love regex's capabilities, but i hate writing patterns :S
08:49  coldhead: in perl you can write multi-line regular expressions
08:49  coldhead: which are much more readable if you ask me

11:30  christopher22: bot-t: why is it that when I send it to the backend (Python/Django) that I still only get Objects back?
11:30  bot-t: christopher22, Signs point to yes.
11:31  sean`: it retuns an array, with each key being a key/value hashmap
11:31  sean`: it can be used by ajax's data: parameter to send it as post/get data
11:31  sean`: but hey, if you want a more clearer answer

11:32  christopher22: well i'm using this Jquery part: http://dpaste.com/262833/
11:32  christopher22: and i'm using load to reload a part of my page once a user hit's the submit button
11:32  christopher22: I want to send POST data back to server.. which in this case is: $(this).serializeArray()
11:33  christopher22: I would then like to use that Data in my backend.. (which is Python/Django)

11:48  bot-t: msimurin__, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
11:48  sean`: christopher22, the data parameter doesn't go that deep I reckon
11:48  sean`: try $.load ('url', data) instead of {form: data}
11:50  Vorspire: (sean`): I'm getting an error in my scripts saying "cannot access propery 0 of null" - now i know exactly where this is happening, but the odd thing is that the property does actually get read properly...
11:51  msimurin__: sean` i am using it in my application(c++ based) loading jquery in the webkit, it all works fine except when i do several executions in a row, first one triggers, the second wont trigger
11:51  msimurin__: i am thinking it might be a bug with the framework and jquery in combination
11:52  sean`: Vorspire, if you remove the lnie the error is gone?
11:53  sean`: msimurin__, wheres the psatebin link?
11:53  Vorspire: sean`; i can't remove the line because I need it, but if i remove that line it says "read property 1 of null" instead :/
11:53  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/PDEGB/
11:53  Vorspire: the property is regex array of matches
11:54  msimurin__: sean` i can only add c++ code, you dont mind that?
11:54  Vorspire: sean`; according to console.log, it's actually being read properly
11:55  sean`: Vorspire, if you remove the line and the error is still there
11:55  sean`: it's not that line
11:55  sean`: msimurin__, I need the jquery code you're executing
11:55  Vorspire: it's odd

11:57  Vorspire: yes
11:57  sean`: console.log (__matches) ?
11:58  Vorspire: yea, i put that there to prove the matches are populated
11:58  sean`: what does it say
11:58  sean`: cause it feels like it's returning false
11:58  msimurin__: sean` sorry and sure here it is, http://pastebin.com/zEVMeJtb, jquery is visible
11:59  Vorspire: sean`; it returns the matches as expected, i'll uncomment the line :)
11:59  sean`: msimurin__, .val ('foo') and .submit () do not block each other
11:59  carl0: is possible to use a <form> inside another? ie. <form><form> </form></form>
11:59  samtihen: is there a better way to do this? $(this).parent().children(".hidden").show("blind");
11:59  sean`: carl0, it's possible
12:00  sean`: samtihen, $(this).siblings ().andSelf ().show ('blind')
12:00  msimurin__: sean` i am also trying to do simple javascript this.click() after the val(), do they block eachother??
12:00  samtihen: thanks
12:00  Vorspire: sean`; please try a hrad-refresh on that fiddle for the log line :)
12:00  Vorspire: hard*
12:00  samtihen: very much
12:00  sean`: msimurin__, if you're not chaining they can never block each other
12:00  msimurin__: chaining?
12:00  sean`: msimurin__, yes, what jQuery is known for
12:01  sean`: perhaps you're js generated code is invalid
12:01  sean`: msimurin__, try adding a ; at the end of each js line
12:01  sean`: msimurin__, like so http://pastebin.com/Kcb93Riz
12:02  Vorspire: sean`; i think i figured it out... if <a> href attr is './index.php' for example, will jQuery pick the href up as ./index or http://blahblah.com/index.php ?
12:02  msimurin__: hmm if that was problem wouldnt the script be unusable? i will try still
12:02  sean`: Vorspire,
12:03  sean`: no
12:03  sean`: it's if (__parts[i] == null) {
12:03  sean`: your for is based on an array, while this is a hashmap
12:03  sean`: you should be using for (i in parts) { if (__parts[i] ..
12:03  msimurin__: as i said they bothw ork perfect until i try to use both of them in a single function
12:03  sean`: I dunno whyit says line 11, that's inaccurate
12:03  msimurin__: i cant believe i break my head for 2 hours with something simple as this
12:04  sean`: msimurin__, have you tried the ; ?
12:05  Vorspire: (sean`): i commented out that for-loop, it's not really needed yet and i still get the same error, I thik it's because of the second $.URL call with the .attr('href') returning './index.php' instead of 'http://www.domain.com/index.php'
12:05  sean`: trust me, your for loop is a problem on its own
12:05  sean`: might not be this one, but it is
12:06  Vorspire: but it's //commented out :S
12:06  msimurin__: sean` yes, just tried, well thanks for help anyway
12:06  sean`: msimurin__, lol oke
12:06  sean`: happy hunting
12:06  msimurin__: wish its fun as well
12:06  sean`: Vorspire, I'm not saying it's THAT error
12:07  sean`: but it'll cause an error
12:07  sean`: Vorspire,
12:07  sean`: console.log (__matches[0])
12:08  Vorspire: sean`; I'll give it a shot
12:09  Vorspire: well that works... the error is relatedto $('a').attr('href'); not returning the fully qualified URI, it's keeping the ./ at the start
12:09  sean`: ok
12:09  sean`: well fixed then!
12:10  Vorspire: I'll just have to prepend currentDomain to it
12:10  Vorspire: well, domain.host in that context
12:10  sean`: what are you up to
12:10  Vorspire: masking url's and then using BBQ
12:10  sean`: ok
12:10  Vorspire: it's all working fine except that sumb error, but i know the source now thanks :D
12:10  Vorspire: dumb*
12:11  sean`: ha
12:16  Vorspire: sean`; that was definately the problem :/ jQuery won't pick up ./ as the TLD
12:16  Vorspire: annoying
12:16  sean`: why would it
12:17  Vorspire: sean`; i just assumed it would because the browser automatically converts it, but it looks like i'll have to prepend that crap heh
12:18  sean`: well ./ is current directory
12:18  Vorspire: yeah
12:18  sean`: / is from root
12:19  Vorspire: what method should I use for prepending, in the event that the user may write href="index.php" OR "./index.php"? regex.replace?
12:22  poppiez: does anyone know why IE8 says this.complete == false for cached images? seems to happen very randomly. I use the one( 'load' ), each( function() { if ( this.complete ) { $(this).trigger( 'load' ); } }); method
12:23  poppiez: works great in IE7
12:24  Vorspire: sean`; what would be the best method to detect the TLD of that href starting with ./index.php ../index.php or just index.php?
12:28  Iszak: regex.
12:29  Iszak: /^(?:\.{1,2}\/)?/
12:30  Vorspire: Iszak, ty m8

12:35  sean`: hi m8
12:35  m8: hi sean` :D
12:36  Vorspire: (Iszak): although that regex is valid, i need to replace ./ with domain.scheme + domain.host + domain.path - but ../ will have to be domain.scheme + domain.host + domain.partial_path - if you get what i mean, so i think i'll have to do a lot of checking, especially if the href is ../../../ for example :S
12:37  Iszak: indeed you will.
12:37  Vorspire: recursive replacement using domain.path - /dir - or something
12:38  Vorspire: well, since i haven't slept in over 24 hours now, this is going to batter my head lol

18:55  mahen23: hey
18:55  mahen23: does jquery has the autoupdate function?
18:56  mahen23: like it refresh a div automatically on a given number of secs
18:56  CGo: Just taking a stab but I think you need to seperate the "img.shot" into "img .shot"
18:56  compufreak: mahen23: setInterval
18:57  compufreak: mahen23: That's regular js, I don't think jQuery has its own
18:57  mahen23: i cant do it
18:57  mahen23: am too weak
19:00  boaau: CGo, yeah that's nice but why the 1st img dosn't hide ?
19:00  boaau: any idea ?
19:01  boaau: although i use hide() function
19:05  mahen23: i want to buy a computer that even if people steal it, i would not care since it cost me nothing
19:05  mahen23: any ideas?
19:06 +dabear_: mahen23: go ask in another channel?
19:06  mahen23: i am
19:07  CGo: Use a terminal.
19:08  nail_: or some old mainframe, no one will try to steal it
19:08  NET||abuse: mahen23, steal a computer
19:08  ysynopsis: bolt it to the floor
19:08  CGo: Put a blinking red LED on it and make it beep at 1 second intervals.
19:08  CGo: Should have everyone steer clear.
19:09  mahen23: i want to use it in the bus
19:09  mahen23: so i do not think a terminal is a good idea
19:09  CGo: Unless you count a netbook with an HSDPA connection.
19:09  CGo: Bah.
19:11  shaahul: why arent rounded corners seen in Opera with jqueryMOBILE?
19:11  Rotham: how can I merge an array of objects into 1 data string I can use with post()?
19:11  NET||abuse: cause opera is a pain in the ass
19:12  shaahul: quit
19:13  CGo: Rotham, serialize().
19:13  CGo: Apply it to the form.
19:14  CGo: Though you're probably looking for serializeArray(), which casts it to an object array usable for AJAX requests, rather than a string.
19:14  icekk: hey vorspire
19:14  Rotham: serialize seems to grab the value of submit too tho... and from what I read it doesnt grab the value of disabled or hidden items?
19:14  CGo: I didn't have issues with that.
19:14  CGo: But you could try changing the submit button to a <button> element.
19:15  Rotham: hmm ill test it more
19:15  Underscore: Hey, I was wondering if there's a way to fade a set of elements -except- for a specified one?
19:15  CGo: Underscore, $(selector).not(selector).function();
19:16  Underscore: ok, thanks :)
19:18  Underscore: And how would I use a passed argument as a jquery selector? (Rather than reading the argument as the selector itself)
19:19  Underscore: Do i just omit the quotes?
19:21  rmurphey: Underscore: what are you trying to do?
19:21  rmurphey: you have a reference to the element that you don't want to affect?
19:22  darkangel: Do fiddles disappear after a while?
19:24  Underscore: rmurphy: I'm using an ajax request within a function. The function has an argument of 'name' which is this.id in the html. I want to hide() all "li" elements on the page except for the one that has been clicked (so the id of that would be 'name')
19:26  rmurphey: why not $('li').click(function() { $(this).siblings().hide().end().show(); });
19:26  rmurphey: or similar
19:27  rmurphey: or $(this).show().siblings().hide()
19:27  Underscore: Hmm, didn't think about siblings
19:27  rmurphey: but basically, use the dom relationship to figure out which ones to hide
19:27  Underscore: that would work I think
19:27  Underscore: thanks
19:30  Underscore: Hmm, but if I'm trying to use that within the ajax call success function
19:30  Underscore: can i still use 'this'?
19:30 +dabear_: this refers to the clicked element
19:31 +dabear_: use .live if you area appending elements dynamically
19:31 +dabear_: @Underscore
19:31 +dabear_: see ?live
19:31  bot-t: .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
19:31  rmurphey: Underscore: or store a reference to the element outside of the success function
19:32  rmurphey: (i'm not sure if live is relevant here, but it may be)
19:32  Underscore: hmm, ok. Well, the id of the element is passed as an argument in the function as 'name', how would I use this within the selector?
19:32  rmurphey: Underscore: at this point a fiddle showing what you're doing might be helpful
19:32  Underscore: alright
19:34 --- fabiomcosta_ is now known as fabiomcosta
19:35  Ballresin: $('\'' + var + '\'')
19:35  Ballresin: Oops, forgot # in there
19:36  Ballresin: $('\'#' + var + '\'')
19:37  Ballresin: Stupid semicolon....
19:37  Underscore: wow, Ballresin, you saying that made me realise that was the problem, I was trying $(name) rather than $('#' + name)
19:37  Ballresin: $('\'#' + var + '\'')
19:37  rmurphey: Ballresin: um, really no need for all that weird escaping
19:38  rmurphey: $('#' + name) should work just fine
19:38  Ballresin: Yup, or just modify name
19:38  rmurphey: or if you really did need single quotes, then just enclose them in double quotes
19:38  Ballresin: Yeah.
19:39  Ballresin: Id just modify the incoming argument with the #
19:39  Ballresin: Then just $(name) would work.
19:42  Underscore: same difference though right?
19:42  Underscore: because I need name as a pure id for other parts of the function anyway
19:44  Ballresin: Copy selector version into a separate var if you need to maintain the original.

20:06  ldexterldesign: hey guys, i'm working with setInterval here, but it's only iterating once? http://pastebin.com/QrX3TSin any tips?
20:06  ldexterldesign: i need it to iterate infinitely i.e. loop
20:07  Renegade001: ldexterldesign: try removing the () in the set interval
20:07  Renegade001: Or go , setInterval( function() { //Your function }, 1000);
20:07  nicklovescode: ldexterldesign: don't execute the function, just pass var
20:07  nicklovescode: oh, yeah, what Renegade001 said ;)
20:07  ldexterldesign: Renegade001: yep, that works. thanks much
20:07  ldexterldesign: Renegade001: what's going on there then?
20:08  ldexterldesign: Renegade001: what's the dif?
20:08  nicklovescode: functions are variables, so when you pass the variable representing the function, it can call it every X seconds
20:08  Renegade001: Well, it's just the wrong syntax :D
20:08  nicklovescode: but you're sending the _results_ of the function to the set interval, so that's what it's doing every X seconds
20:09  nicklovescode: function hello() { alert('hi'); return 'bye'; }
20:09  Renegade001: Ah, so the is a reason, sorry ldexterldesign, what nicklovescode said! xD
20:09  nicklovescode: setInterval(hello(), 1000); === setInterval('bye', 1000) instead of allowing it to execute the function
20:09  SoulRaven: that is wrong in thie function and whay is not working http://pastebin.com/VLGnM5b7
20:09  nicklovescode: understand?
20:10  ldexterldesign: nicklovescode: yea, so i needed the variable not the function
20:10  nicklovescode: yeah
20:10  ldexterldesign: nicklovescode: cool
20:10  ldexterldesign: nicklovescode: always good to know
20:10  ldexterldesign: cheers again guys

20:13  nicklovescode: is thisValue a variable, or do you mean something like $(this).val()
20:13  Rotham: how can I target the parent of $(this) within a function?
20:13  Renegade001: SoulRaven: Try passing your callback in setTimeout wrapped in another function
20:13  nicklovescode: $(this).parent()
20:13  nicklovescode: Rotham ^
20:13  Renegade001: So setTimeout(function() { alert("BOO!"); }, 3000);
20:13  Rotham: :D thanks

20:51  nicklovescode: idea: a jquery plugin where you could say $.js(['sammy','mustache', etc..]) which would map to a site that would get the correct source and $.getScript it
20:52  paul_irish: there actually is one for that.
20:52  nicklovescode: what's it called?
20:52  ldexterldesign: paul_irish: she's cool. i'll be banging her in a week or so, so all good
20:52  paul_irish: ldexterldesign: good man. tell her i say hi.

20:53  paul_irish: the mysterious new plugins site will help fix this
20:53  paul_irish: when its ready in 4 years
20:53  ajpiano: nicklovescode: you could just use requirejs for that

20:56  ldexterldesign: paul_irish: you must be rolling in hoes
20:56  paul_irish: haha. my gf was asking me who the hot chick on my screen was just now
20:57  paul_irish: so yes. rolling in them. :p
20:57  ldexterldesign: paul_irish: ahhhhh [sorry]
20:57  ldexterldesign: paul_irish: sorry paul irish's g/f!
20:58  paul_irish: do you have all your other hoes immortalized as jpg's in your domain's root?
20:59  themiddleman: Hi guys, I am trying to check if a tab at a tab index is disabled, there is ".tabs( "option" , options )" but I need to hand it a tabIndex argument too, is that possible or is there another way?
21:00  Hierofant: Whats another browsershots.org?
21:00  nicklovescode: ajpiano: how would I use it to get say the jQuery template plugin
21:00  ldexterldesign: paul_irish: hmmm, i could - possible app?

21:06  nicklovescode: it would still provide the link, which in itself would be useful
21:06  paul_irish: oh thx
21:06  ajpiano: nicklovescode: that would be pretty interesting thing :)
21:06  ajpiano: let's make it when we are orking cows together, nicklovescode
21:07  nicklovescode: huh?
21:07 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 94 seconds
21:07  themiddleman: With tabs I can do .tabs("disable") to disable all tabs or .tabs("disable", index) to disable just a single tab.  I want to query if a single tab is disabled - I can query a group of tabs like .tabs( "option" , "disabled") but If I hand that a 3rd argument (the index of the single tab) it will act as a setter
21:08  themiddleman: So how do I query if a single tab is disabled?
21:08  firepoet: It can't be as easy as .is(":disabled") can it?  ;)
21:09  themiddleman: firepoet: that could work, let me try
21:09  firepoet: (total guess)
21:11  firepoet: So do folks know how Droppable decides if a Draggable has left it?  Specifically: does it cache its dimensions or something such that dynamically changing its size would screw it up??
21:12  paul_irish: so you're changing the size of the droppable mid drag?
21:12  paul_irish: sounds like you should read the source of droppable :)
21:12  enerel1: paul is next zack
21:12  paul_irish: say what
21:12  firepoet: Yep.
21:12  paul_irish: SugaSlide is next zack
21:12  firepoet: And yes, I'm changing sizes of Droppable mid-drag.
21:13  paul_irish: of the droppable? or the draggable
21:13  SugaSlide: what i do now?
21:13  bot-t: (18 hours 50 mins ago) <|Hopsy|> tell SugaSlide omg SugaSlide couldnt you wait for 2 minutes :P i was brushing my teeth
21:13  firepoet: Of the Droppable.
21:13  paul_irish: cool.
21:13  SugaSlide: lmao
21:13  firepoet: I've been doing other crazy stuff, like scrolling the Droppables up and down while there's a Drag going, but that also breaks things severely.
21:13  firepoet: :-)
21:13  firepoet: Had to turn off the scrolling zones.
21:13  SugaSlide: bot-t: tell hopsy you took tooooooooooo long
21:13  bot-t: SugaSlide, Okay.
21:13  paul_irish: you guys are cute
21:13  SugaSlide: who is zack?
21:14  SugaSlide: with?
21:14  SugaSlide: wait
21:14  SugaSlide: wtf?
21:14  paul_irish: IRC relationship via bot-t.
21:14  firepoet: *confused*
21:14  paul_irish: bot-t: i love u
21:14  bot-t: paul_irish, Loading bar | jQuery Plugins - First off, very nice work! I love this plugin! I'm using it on my website: http://dpender.com/new/gallery/wedding http://plugins.jquery.com/content/loading-bar
21:14  paul_irish: thank you
21:14  SugaSlide: lol
21:14  SugaSlide: um we were reviewing movies lastnight
21:14  paul_irish: firepoet: if you used html5 drag and drop you could do all this
21:14  SugaSlide: deciding which to download
21:14  firepoet: Oh goodness.
21:14  paul_irish: just with a shittier api
21:14  SugaSlide: meh
21:15  firepoet: Lol
21:15  firepoet: You just sent shivers down my spine, paul_irish
21:15  SugaSlide: html5 has an api???????????
21:15 * firepoet refuses to use html5 'till it's .. "done."
21:15  firepoet: ;)
21:15  paul_irish: firepoet: why
21:15 * svnlto chuckles
21:15  firepoet: Just another browser compatibility thing to worry about, really.
21:16  SugaSlide: whoa
21:16  SugaSlide: here we go
21:16  SugaSlide: :(
21:16  SugaSlide: things gonna get rough in jQ tonight
21:16  SugaSlide: lol
21:16  firepoet: Anyways.. if Droppable starts learning how to use HTML5, that would be fine.
21:16  svnlto: hardboiled
21:16  paul_irish: firepoet: where do you learn about web dev?
21:16  ldexterldesign: just rolled a new comment feature guys: http://www.ldexterldesign.co.uk/2010/10/appropriation/ would love some feedback. basically want to encourage more conversation on my blog
21:16  svnlto: it's on!
21:17  firepoet: paul_irish: sadly, I only ever have time to learn enough to solve the problem at hand.. which can lead to patchwork knowledge at best.
21:17  firepoet: To be solely a programmer again.. *sigh*.
21:17  ldexterldesign: is it too distracting, do you like the aesthetic, functionality etc.
21:17  ldexterldesign: hopefully simple but effective
21:17  paul_irish: firepoet: oh i know.. that's cool man..
21:17  paul_irish: i'm just asking
21:18  firepoet: So I am about to dig into Droppable code I guess.
21:18  firepoet: *sigh*
21:18  paul_irish: because if i write an article on how to do html5 in a crossbrowser way.. and it'll be perfect.. i want you to read it
21:18  paul_irish: and im asking where i should publish it so that you read it
21:18  firepoet: Ahh..
21:18  firepoet: I'm always happy to have new things to put in my Google Reader...
21:19  firepoet: But as it stands I read Ars Technica, InfoQ, Techmeme, Wired News...
21:19  ajpiano: haha
21:19  firepoet: Haven't specifically added any web dev feeds.
21:19  paul_irish: that is true.
21:19  firepoet: Though that could be useful.. suggestions?
21:19  SugaSlide: there are web dev feeds?
21:19  firepoet: No clue.
21:19  SugaSlide: whoa
21:19  firepoet: Heh.
21:19  themiddleman: firepoet: turns out it doesnt work, back to square 1
21:19  paul_irish: http://paulirish.com/2010/front-end-development-feeds-to-follow/
21:19  firepoet: Sorry themiddleman
21:19  [KS]: uU advertising
21:19  paul_irish: firepoet SugaSlide ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
21:19  firepoet: How did I know that was coming?  ;)
21:19  SugaSlide: show off :(
21:19  svnlto: paul_irish: a lot of them are dead tho
21:20  SugaSlide: HA
21:20  paul_irish: svnlto: what reader do you use that dead feeds matters?
21:20  SugaSlide: BUSTED
21:20  SugaSlide: fix ur shit
21:20  firepoet: OMG.. 227 feeds?
21:20  firepoet: I don't think I'd ever stop reading.
21:20  svnlto: paul_irish: googlereader and netnewswire.
21:20  paul_irish: google reader doesnt bitch about dead feeds
21:20  firepoet: I need a list of top 5.  ;)
21:20  firepoet: (Manager here.. heh)
21:21  ajpiano: svnlto: i use that exact combo, no bitching
21:21  SugaSlide: paul_irish.... they in russian????
21:21  paul_irish: firepoet: no smashing mag, net tuts, A list apart?
21:21  paul_irish: i think i added one russian one recently.
21:21  ajpiano: firepoet, that bundle as a whole isn't more active than one like, active blog
21:21  firepoet: Yeah.. just saw some russian posts.. definitely don't want those.
21:21  firepoet: Ahh..
21:21  svnlto: ajpiano: dead as in last updated 2006
21:21  firepoet: ajpiano: that helps
21:21  ajpiano: svnlot i donno i can deal
21:21  ajpiano: ;p
21:21  firepoet: Let's find out.
21:22  paul_irish: thats romanian guys! not russian.
21:22  paul_irish: geez.
21:22  firepoet: Ah
21:22  firepoet: (sorry)
21:22  SugaSlide: its still russian to us
21:22  paul_irish: :)
21:22  SugaSlide: pfft
21:22  svnlto: both countries start and end the same way, right
21:22  SugaSlide: if it looks like english after a bottle of vodka.... its russian
21:22  themiddleman: firepoet: well what I really need to do is move to another tab when I disable the current one since it doesn't do that, but it doesnt select inactive tabs so I will just select them all :)
21:23  SugaSlide: thats the rule of thumb...
21:23  svnlto: SugaSlide: lol
21:23  ajpiano: firepoet fscking åmå
21:23  ajpiano: whoops
21:23  ajpiano: firepoet http://ajpiano.com/cap/1cd097.png
21:23  firepoet: Wth?

21:23  firepoet: themiddleman: nice
21:24  svnlto: paul_irish: i prefer your delicious feed tho. it's not too bad
21:24  paul_irish: svnlto: its a good feed.
21:24  firepoet: What is this picture going to help me with?  ;)
21:24  ajpiano: how much volume there is
21:24  svnlto: paul_irish: <3
21:24  SugaSlide: theres 4 languages in the world... english.. americaneese... chineese.. and russian
21:25  ajpiano: lol
21:25  enerel1: paul can i just set that like this?  header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://mongolio.com');
21:25  firepoet: Ok.. I've got your bundle, paul_irish .. may the gods have mercy on my soul-thing.
21:25  paul_irish: enerel1: no its a response header. so it has to be configured on the mongolio web server
21:25  enerel1: oh
21:26  firepoet: Well well.. this.proportions = { width: this.element[0].offsetWidth, height: this.element[0].offsetHeight };
21:26  firepoet: Guess that explains everything about all my weird mid-drag bugs.
21:27  firepoet: I need an "updateProportions" function I guess.
21:27  firepoet: (er.. method)
21:29  firepoet: Has anyone ever used the "refreshPositions" option in Droppable?
21:29  firepoet: It's definitely not in the documentation, but mentioned in the source code.
21:30  paul_irish: try it out
21:30  firepoet: Oh I will.
21:30  firepoet: Just wanted to see if anyone had seen any funny side effects.
21:30  enerel1: http://www.miat.com/grab.html the post is done now but the output is not showing?
21:31  firepoet: Heh.. doesn't help.
21:31  firepoet: Maybe it's new.
21:33  paul_irish: enerel1: can you space out your postCORS call so i can breakpoint in your callback?
21:33  paul_irish: also add some console log in the callback to see if it gets hit
21:33  paul_irish: i can verify the server responds with html
21:34  enerel1: okay
21:34  enerel1: its done
21:38  SoulRaven: fill() function is a part of jquery ?
21:40  mspp: hey, is there any way to use inline js or a callback to execute some functions with jquerymobile?
21:40  mspp: because when it loads a new pag via ajax, the inline js is not executed. And i couldnt find any callback things in the docs
21:42  ldexterldesign: does anyone know if there's a way of detecting if a Unicode character exists on the client-side?
21:42  Jonz: ldexterldesign: only functional testing, that I'm aware of
21:42  ldexterldesign: i literally have no clue how to go about this
21:42  SoulRaven: fill() function is a part of jquery ?
21:42  enerel1: paul are you there?
21:42  hasrb: mspp: I think if you specify the dataType as "script" it evals the js
21:43  Jonz: i.e., output the character in an element with a fixed size, and then check the height/width or whatever of that element, it'll be the right size if the element exists, probaby the wrong size if it doesn't..
21:43  ldexterldesign: Jonz: what's functional testing in a nutshell?
21:43  Jonz: ^
21:43  ldexterldesign: Jonz: ahh, sos, didn't see your last comment
21:44  Jonz: it could be screwy if the browser's "i dont know this character" character is the same size as the one you're testing for, but it usually works, obviously its a huge hack
21:44  ldexterldesign: Jonz: cool, rather like checking if an ele exists in a dom using length()
21:44  firepoet: aww yeah.. figured out how to get the height of a droppable.. wonder if setting it will help...
21:44  mspp: hasrb: could you give an example pls? :)
21:44  hasrb: mspp: it's in the docs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
21:44  Jonz: precisely |dexter|design.. or ldexterldesign
21:45  ldexterldesign: Jonz: yea, you couldn't use length() with this. for instance &heart; will pump out '?' - it would still == 1
21:45  Jonz: oh, sorry
21:45  Jonz: i meant, check the width/height
21:45  Jonz: .css('height');..
21:45  ldexterldesign: Jonz: i can't see how that would work either?
21:46  Jonz: if the character is outputted properly, it will be a known width
21:46  Jonz: if the character is outputted improperly, it will be differnt
21:46  Jonz: (probably)
21:46  ldexterldesign: Jonz: basically i want to be sure my user is seeing the heart unicode i'm using and not something else e.g. '?' [a question mark]
21:46  Jonz: right
21:46  Jonz: the heart is going to be a different width/height than the ?
21:46  Jonz: you test it on your browser where the heart works
21:46  Jonz: find the correct width/height
21:47  ldexterldesign: Jonz: haha, this is a massive hack, you're correct
21:47  Jonz: it's the only way that I'm aware of
21:47  ldexterldesign: Jonz: surely if the text is zoomed for a start this will fuck up?
21:47  Jonz: dunno
21:48  Jonz: just use an image if you're worried about it
21:48  ldexterldesign: Jonz: i'd be surprised if the width of the unicodes is consistent cross-browser anyway
21:48  Jonz: try it out for yerself
21:48  ldexterldesign: Jonz: mmm, basically i have this great idea to use a unicode sprite...
21:48  [KS]: width inside same fonts is consistent
21:48  [KS]: fixed-width fonts have same width too
21:48  ldexterldesign: Jonz: if you got to http://www.ldexterldesign.co.uk/ and disable css you will see what i mean in the footer
21:49  ldexterldesign: go*
21:49  enerel1: paul_irish: are you there?
21:54  nullwire: Is there a way I can make a dropped-down select form undrop?
21:54  nullwire: or not have the ability to drop in the first place
21:54  Mixmasterxp: holy cow, is that the real john resig?
21:55  Mixmasterxp: anyways, what is the alternate name for expanders?
21:55  Mixmasterxp: or suggestions for plugins that can collapse and expand a generated list
21:55  Hierofant: which should I use inside a JQuery script, $(window).location.href or window.location.href?
21:57  nicklovescode: Hierofant: 2
21:59  firepoet: FIXED!
21:59  firepoet: Damn.
21:59  firepoet: So the refreshPositions: true option was supposed to be on the Draggables, not the Droppables.
21:59  firepoet: That made everything work.
21:59  Mixmasterxp: accordion :|
21:59  McConnell: hey everyone, I have a small question about iframes and .load() if anyone has some time
22:02  firepoet: L8er all.
22:10  jinglehoff: I need a customized dropdown.   Are there any others besides the filament group one and http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2009/07/28/reinventing-drop-down-with-css-jquery.aspx
22:11  sean`: what's wrong with it
22:11  NET||abuse: ok, so i want to publish a dynamic widget to be installed on other sites, anyone know any good articles/tutorials on this topic with jquery in mind?
22:11  sean`: jinglehoff, http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-multiselect-plugin-with-themeroller-support/
22:12  jinglehoff: the jquery ui seems large for just wanting the dropdown
22:12  jinglehoff: sean`: thanks for the link
22:15  losing: jinglehoff: you dont have to download all of jQueryUI: http://jqueryui.com/download
22:16 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
22:16  straw_hat: has anyone got any idea why $(window).height() would ever throw an error? the error from firebug is that e.style is undefined.
22:16  straw_hat: i am very confused. seems like a straightforward little bit of code.
22:16  sean`: straw_hat, removing that line removes the error?
22:17  straw_hat: yep. Actually, i guess the offending piece is $(window) since nothing works on that JQuery object
22:17  enerel1: coldhead i did it
22:17  enerel1: i mean paul helped
22:18  straw_hat: a TypeError from Firebug, that e.style is undefined.
22:19  straw_hat: It works on another site, though, I've been looking for any differences, and have come up empty.
22:20  pifantastic: straw_hat: what version of jQuery?
22:20  straw_hat: 1.1.2
22:21  pifantastic: damn
22:21  straw_hat: yea, it's the one the CMS ships with :/
22:21  pifantastic: what CMS?
22:21  straw_hat: indexhibit
22:21  straw_hat: hm, this other site is using 1.2.3
22:22  straw_hat: i hadn't noticed
22:23  pifantastic: Im not sure that 1.1.2 had a height() method, it might have required a plugin
22:23  pifantastic: nm it did
22:23  straw_hat: i'm blushing now
22:24  straw_hat: thanks pifantastic... that was the issue. It looks like 1.1.2 had height and width functions but they simply didn't work on window.
22:24 * straw_hat sucks at assumptions.
22:25  enerel1: guys why after p.a.c.k.e.r my jquery does not work?
22:26  pifantastic: enerel1: be a little more specific?
22:26  coldhead: enerel1: don't use packer, its for sailors
22:26  enerel1: kkk
22:26  enerel1: what do u sugjest?
22:26  coldhead: google closure is pretty hot
22:26  coldhead: or the YUI compressor
22:26  pifantastic: enerel1: the latest jQueries use google closure I think
22:27  enerel1: okay
22:27  coldhead: or just use really short variable names
22:27  coldhead: enerel1: link me to the page you got working?
22:28  pifantastic: enerel1: Why dont you just use an already packed version on a CDN? http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js
22:28  enerel1: i want to compile my own js
22:29  pifantastic: fair enough
22:30  enerel1: how about to convert it completly unreadable?
22:31  snover: enerel1: get a life.
22:31  snover: enerel1: It’s an open source library.
22:31  enerel1: lol
22:31  enerel1: it is my 3 row code API i want to make it like packer compiled
22:31  enerel1: anything else?
22:32  snover: enerel1: use closure compiler.
22:32  enerel1: not enoght :p
22:33  pifantastic: enerel1: what do you mean not enough?
22:33  enerel1: still readable
22:33  pifantastic: enerel1: you dont want to compile it then, you specifically want to obfuscate it
22:33  pifantastic: enerel1: that's different
22:33  snover: enerel1: protip, it’s CLIENT SIDE CODE
22:33  snover: enerel1: you cannot “protect” it
22:33  snover: so stop trying
22:33  pifantastic: closure, packer, etc are made to make code really small
22:33  jrockjiggz: hey, I normally use .load('url #id') to load in part of a file.
22:33  pifantastic: snover: he could be using it in a desktop app, like AIR
22:34  snover: pifantastic: That’s still client-side code????
22:34  jrockjiggz: but i'm trying to use $.ajax({url: }); but it won't allow be to load part of file
22:34  pifantastic: snover: true
22:34  snover: pifantastic: an air archive is just…an archive containing some assets and a manifest
22:34  pifantastic: snover: but obfuscation is still meaningful in that scenario
22:34  snover: pifantastic: no it isn’t
22:34  pifantastic: snover: yes it is
22:36  snover: pifantastic: You are assuming 1. someone gives a shit, which they don’t; 2. someone that gives a shit is only determined enough to look at the code but not to run it through a packer unpacker; 3. it is the OMG BEST COADS EVAR and everyone wants to steal it
22:36  enerel1: haha
22:37  enerel1: i found it
22:37  enerel1: js encryptor
22:37  pifantastic: I think it's more possible that someone would want to do #2
22:37  pifantastic: and you would want to prevent them from tampering with the innards of your app
22:37  enerel1: http://www.intelliwebtools.com/node/269 anyone wanna use this?
22:37  snover: ok once again
22:37  pifantastic: just enough to keep honest people honest
22:37  pifantastic: security through obscurity blah blah
22:37  snover: if your CLIENT SIDE CODE is doing something that requires being “secure”, you are doing it wrong
22:38  enerel1: not secure just i dont want to show my messed code
22:38  pifantastic: rofl
22:38  enerel1: encoded looks pro :p
22:38  snover: no
22:38  [KS]: haha
22:38  snover: it does not.
22:38  pifantastic: I think it looks pretty pro
22:39  enerel1: you think so too lol
22:39  snover: pifantastic: stop being contrary for the sake of being contrary
22:39  pifantastic: snover: stop
22:40  Rob___: Hey i've got an issue with .load and using a variable as the selector for the bit of content I want to retrieve from the load URL. It's currently pulling out everything on the page? Anybody have any thoughts or can have a look?
22:40  pifantastic: ?paste at Rob___
22:40  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
22:40  enerel1: yess i did my first API i am so happy
22:43  Rob___: Take a look here: http://jsfiddle.net/NHz8q/1/ obviously with these hosted code solutions I doubt you can really debug using .load from another URL?
22:43  pifantastic: Rob___: you are correct, perhaps you can paste an example of what you are trying to load?
22:44  Rob___: will do pifantastic
22:44  sartan: jquery/js newb here. trying to toggle ":hidden" on an div.. The toggle works great, but I want the div element to be hidden when the page first loads. I tried setting the css style visibility:hidden, but this caused an invisible element to grow and shrink
22:45  [KS]: display: none;
22:45  jrockjiggz: i understand serialize() will take the form data and submit via a URI. but it does not seem to include the form ACTION="" uri, forcing one to string it together.. is there an alternative to this problme?
22:45  sartan: oh, of course [KS] :)
22:45  disappearedng: [KS]: are you talking to me?
22:45  [KS]: to sartan
22:45  sartan: That worked. I'll have to figure out some docs to see how it works with the dom, thought the attributes would be the same.
22:45  pifantastic: jrockjiggz: why do you need the action?
22:47  Rob___: ok here's both of the hosted code examples: jquery + page1.php: http://jsfiddle.net/NHz8q/1/, + page2.php: http://jsfiddle.net/BsEPq/ , it basically works like this: you click the list item anchor, which holds the item name for the external file in it's href, the jquery file gets this and puts this into a variable for the .load to use.
22:48  Rob___: Like i said currently the load is pulling the whole of page2, into the #project_content, instead of just the id from the variable
22:48  jrockjiggz: pifantastic: I am submiting form using .load(). the form submits well using URL, but to include the form data i am using serialize
22:49  pifantastic: jrockjiggz: Im not sure what you mean by "submitting form using .load()"
22:49  [KS]: jrockjiggz: try $.ajaxForm plugin ...
22:50  Rob___: Anybody have any thoughts on my .load issue?
22:51  pifantastic: Rob___: perhaps you need a space between the url and the selector?
22:52  pifantastic: $("#project_content").load(loadURL + ' #'+folioItem);
22:52  Rob___: hmm, ill give it a go. thanks
22:53  Rob___: wow pifantastic that did it
22:53  Rob___: how the hell. I spent like an hour trying to figure that put. (relatively new)
22:53  Rob___: out*
22:55  Rob___: Thanks very much pifantastic!
22:55  pifantastic: np
22:56  jonthomas83: I'm trying to use one select dropdown option to auto-populate another select dropdown automatically with the same option, can anyone help me understand why this code won't work for me? Many thanks http://drupal.pastebin.com/MyyQNuZ9
22:59  jrockjiggz: who else here gets .value and .val() mixed up ALL_THE_TIME...
22:59  jrockjiggz: .value() and .val :x
23:00  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: Have I got them mixed up, sorry mate, I'm a newbie to all this
23:02  Hates_: I have a single text field form which is submitted when the user presses return. I've bound to the submit event, but it only works the first time I enter data in the field and press return. further presses dont work. what am I doing wrong?
23:03  jrockjiggz: jonthomas83: include ur HTML
23:04  jrockjiggz: Hates_: if you add alert('test') does it appear with each click?
23:05  Hates_: jrockjiggz: d'oh, yeah that's working, I guess I've messed up my overlay code. sorry :(
23:06  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: Sorry mate, here you go...http://jsfiddle.net/tbQ7x/
23:09  Jarda: oh I hate box-model
23:10  Jarda: width: 100px; padding: 10px; the outer width becomes 120px.. this is just so retarded
23:10  Jarda: kills the usefullness of grid systems..
23:10  jrockjiggz: jonthomas83: code looks fine, try alert(selectedYear) to see if your are getting the right value
23:11  jrockjiggz: and check if .change() is not messing you up
23:11  jrockjiggz: oh wait
23:12  jrockjiggz: its because .date-year values are 2004,2005,2006..   while #edit-taxonomy-10 values are 18,19,20...
23:13  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: thanks for your time I'll check it out, thank you
23:15  Vorspire: anyone know a good regex pattern to detect / or ./ or ../ ? .. seems simple enough, but i aint slep in 30 something hours and it's making no sense now >_>
23:16  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: that 19, 20, 21, 22 values stuff is automated unfortunately, is there any way I can rejig my code to select the correct label instead of targetting the value in that field etc? Thanks for showing me that that, I never even noticed
23:20  jrockjiggz: if(selectorAVal = selectorBVal){ selectorB.val() = selectorA.val() }
23:20  jrockjiggz: jonthomas83: sorry, should be == in the if statement
23:21  l4rk: wrong
23:21  l4rk: val(newval)
23:21  AndChat: Hello
23:21  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: I don't think I have an if statement in there mate, should there be one?
23:22  l4rk: ?hello @ AndChat
23:22  bot-t: AndChat, :)
23:23  AndChat: Lolz yeah just setting up the app
23:23  paul_irish: anyone interested in a documentation sprint for @boiler_plate ? i'm gonna hop on tinychat and start writing and shit. would love help. :)  http://tinychat.com/boilerplate
23:24  darkele: Hello
23:24  Hierofant: Is there a way to track if a page & its resources exist in cache, and if so, do something different?
23:24  unruthless: Vorspire, o/t but try "((\.)*)/"
23:25  unruthless: there's probably a better way to do that, but that should work
23:26  jrockjiggz: Hierofant: i'm not sure, but: if(jQuery){ alert('library is true') }
23:26  unruthless: also, Vorspire, if you need to test a regex try http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
23:26  Vorspire: unruthless, thanks for the reply :)
23:26  Hierofant: jrockjiggz - shouldn't that always eval == true?
23:27  Vorspire: yea I tried that but my monitor is too high of a resolution to see anythig :P and i'm on 42" lol
23:27  Vorspire: have to use regexpal.com
23:27  JKarsrud: jrockjiggz: Guessing if(!typeof jQuery == 'undefined') { alert('jquery exists'); }
23:28  JKarsrud: is a better solution
23:29  jrockjiggz: yup
23:30  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: not sure why there needs to be?
23:32  jrockjiggz: jonthomas83: ?
23:32  jonthomas83: jrockjiggz: sorry mate, was talking bout if statements and not sure if your "yup" was in answer to my earlier question! :s
23:33  jonthomas83: Can anyone tell me how I can change the selected option on a select drop down? I can't use .val(); I'm passing a variable and need the option of a select box to match that variable. Any help would be greatly appreciated
23:36  icekk: Hey how does this code work: does it call first function on hover and then call second function on hoverout? http://pastebin.com/ayty1w5s
23:37  JKarsrud: icekk: Yep, first function on mouseover, and second on mouseout
23:37  datarecal: any thoughts on why this doesnt work : http://paste2.org/p/1052653
23:38  datarecal: trying to detect a change in select boxes
23:38  JKarsrud: datarecal: Is your markup exactly like that?
23:38  datarecal: yup
23:38  JKarsrud: If it is, jQuery doesn't know about #employees yet
23:39  JKarsrud: Wrap the code in document.ready, or place the script tag _after_ the select
23:39  datarecal: so put it below the select id=...
23:40  datarecal: perfect thanks
23:40  datarecal: what is the way to get the value of the currently change selectbox
23:40  datarecal: or i guess what it was changed to
23:40  JKarsrud: .val()
23:41  JKarsrud: Inside the change event, use $(this).val()
23:41  icekk: Why doesn't adding a callback method on a animate actually wait to call the callback until the animation is 100% complete? IT seems to call the callback like 75 or half way through
23:41  icekk: its driving me nuts
23:41  JKarsrud: icekk: Code?
23:43  icekk: JKarsrud http://pastebin.com/TdQ7KdV5
23:43  icekk: web gets set to true before the animate is 100% complete
23:43  icekk: *wob
23:44  datarecal: jkarsrud so something like : var url = "index.php?action=chart_chgemp&emp_id="+$(this).val();$(location).attr('href',url);
23:45  JKarsrud: datarecal: More like location.href = url :)
23:45  JKarsrud: But otherwise it should work
23:45  JKarsrud: icekk: Paste on jsfiddle.net with markup please :)
23:45  nelsaidi: hey
23:45  nelsaidi: I'm having an issue with one of my pages - I've tried debugging it for the past half hour gotten no where :/
23:45  nelsaidi: http://2010.igem.org/Team:UCL_London
23:46  JKarsrud: What are we looking for?
23:46  nelsaidi: ""jQuery("#yoooutube").href is undefined""
23:46  nelsaidi: :/
23:47  JKarsrud: attr('href')
23:47  JKarsrud: :)
23:47  icekk: Is there a function to see if any jquery animations are currently running?
23:47  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: When working on a jquery object, you can use the attr function to read and write attributes on the object
23:48  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: Then again, you have 6 errors in there, so
23:49  icekk: Besides a callback is there anyway to wait to execute code until an animate is complete?
23:51  jrockjiggz: icekk: have u tried .animate({ complete: function() { //code here });
23:52  nelsaidi: thanks
23:52  nelsaidi: i'm getting a
23:52  nelsaidi: missing ; before statement
23:52  nelsaidi: but i cant see a missing  semi colon
23:53  icekk: jrockjiggz I'm not sure I understand, how would i modify this code to do that? jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px' }, 400,  wobOn());
23:53  icekk: where does { complete: function() { //code here } go
23:54  icekk: jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px', complete: function() { //code here } }, 400); ??
23:55  icekk: jrockjiggz?
23:55  jrockjiggz: jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px', complete: function() { //code here }, 400);
23:55  jrockjiggz: jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px', complete: function() { alert('animation complete'); }, 400);
23:56  nelsaidi: dont worry sorted :D
23:56  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: Yes, you are missing a semicolon
23:56  JKarsrud: Were at least
23:57  JKarsrud: You site is incredibly slow though
23:57  nelsaidi: i know
23:57  nelsaidi: its not mine, its for a uni project
23:57  nelsaidi: they request all files stored on there servers and not my fast dedi :S
23:57  icekk: hey jrockjiggz this doesnt do anything: 		jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px', complete: function() { alert('asd'); }}, 400);
23:57  nelsaidi: ps I had a ) closing it early
23:58  icekk: jrockjiggz yours isnt syntactically correct: missing : after property id how do i fix it?
23:58  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: Yeah, I was about to say it
23:59  JKarsrud: Use a proper editor or IDE next time, and you're better off finding errors :)
23:59  JKarsrud: I can recommend PHPStorm or WebStorm by JetBrains. Best IDE for JS I've ever worked with
23:59  Vorspire: Visual Studio 2010 ftw
