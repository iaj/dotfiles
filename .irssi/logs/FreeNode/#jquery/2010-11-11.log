00:00 @coldhead: thomasd: have you read Javascript: The Good Parts?
00:00  snover: thomasd: If you aren’t modifying Object.prototype then you do not need to worry about it in the first place
00:00  atula: thomasd: do you have a technical blog ? I'd love to read it sometimes
00:00  thomasd: NO but i no the consept
00:00 @coldhead: oh respect
00:01  thomasd: i don't touch the object.prototype but i have no way of knowing that another script hasent
00:01  atula: aaah the good old... every men in here is a pedo rapist...
00:01  atula: i understand, thomasd
00:01  atula: why so paranoid, my friend ?
00:01  atula: are you not in control of your own codes?
00:02  atula: I mean.. you are the master of your own code, eh ?
00:02  thomasd: atula: i do not have a javascript blog but why would you want to read it
00:02  thomasd: Objects with a null prototype are safer
00:03  danheberden: and pages without a DOM are safer
00:03  atula: perhaps what you need is a version of jquery in a cage.  to make sure it only comes out to play when you want it to... just to make sure!! you should put a thing around jquery's mouth so it doesn't bite... and even file the nails so it doesn't scratch your codes
00:03  thomasd: I dont want there to be any way that any script can affect my script in anny way and messing with the object.prototype is one of the way's that can happen
00:03  danheberden: but, alas, we're stuck with it
00:03 @coldhead: thomasd: i can see your problem but i can see why jQ wouldn't consider it a bug
00:04 @coldhead: there's scope for you to fork jQ and create a paranoid.jQuery that fixes it
00:04  atula: thomasd: my friend, have you ever tried vapor.js ?
00:04 @coldhead: for folks who care
00:04  danheberden: coldhead, haha
00:04  danheberden: jQueranoid
00:04  atula: try this, thomasd: http://vaporjs.com/
00:04 @coldhead: omg does that work on the android devices?
00:04 @coldhead: <33
00:05  atula: of course!
00:05  danheberden: $.isPlainObject( obj).areYouSure()
00:05 @coldhead: $.isDefinitelyPlainAryanObject(ob).forSerious()
00:05  danheberden: forSerious({ forReals: true});
00:06  emanu: Is there a way to create an anchor object in jquery instead of selecting one in html?
00:06  danheberden: emanu - you can do whateva you want
00:06  thomasd: atula thats for people who think that the dom works. And it doesent
00:06  danheberden: but i think your question isn't properly phrased for what you WANT
00:07  atula: emanu: $('<a />') ?
00:07  emanu: ah, thanks guys!
00:07  danheberden: hmm, that easy
00:07  danheberden: emanu: don't forget to appendTo that bad boy anchor
00:07  danheberden: '
00:07  snover: thomasd: http://zetafleet.com/i/4cdb258510eb4.png boy yeah, this looks like a FANTASTIC idea
00:07  snover: I’m so glad you thought of it
00:07  danheberden: (or prependTo, although SO horribly named - not an strong action named method)
00:08  danheberden: damn snover
00:08 @coldhead: that is sexquisite snover
00:08  danheberden: you mean removing the piece of the object that makes it prototypal in a prototypal language means the javascript engine has to do more work?
00:09  danheberden: OBSURD!
00:09  thomasd: snover that doesent make any sence and i will be right back i have to eat
00:09 @coldhead: happy eating, thomasd !
00:09  snover: thomasd: http://zetafleet.com/i/4cdb25f3f41fb.png
00:09  atula: dang. I thought maverick dont' eat...
00:09  atula: javascript maverick
00:09  danheberden: ya, snoer - how dare you eloquently illustrate what he's trying to do!
00:10  atula: all y'all are just being mainstream javascript
00:10  danheberden: removing prototype is so hipster
00:10  amh345: awesome. thanks guys.  mucho appreicated!
00:10  danheberden: "yeah, i run objects with no prototype.. i'm so 1337"
00:12  emanu: so if I have: <td class="editable" contenteditable="true"><span class="data">My Data</span><a href="link">save</a></td> and I want to make it so when I keyup on the TD, it clicks on the link. How do I do that? This is my best guess: $("td.editable").keyup(function() { $(this).????.click(); });
00:14  emanu: does that make sense?
00:14  emanu: ie: how do I select elements contained within an object $(this).a?
00:16  ajpiano: ?concatobj
00:16  bot-t: You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
00:18 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
00:21  comhero: I'm trying to consume a rest API with jquery, but i'm getting a 405 Method Not Allowed in firebug. Code: http://fpaste.org/pHqn/
00:22  snover: thomasd: What you suggested doesn’t even fucking work man. http://jsfiddle.net/snover/KKsXd/1/
00:27  scorphus: I'm wondering how to use 'hover' and it's two functions (handlerIn and handlerOut) with live(), only the In function works, the Out doesnt. Any tips?
00:28  ajpiano: i think you need to use mouseenter and mouseleave
00:30  thomasd: snover you cant change an objects prototype by object.prototype = foo; it has to be the prototype property of the constructor
00:30  scorphus: shame on me, http://api.jquery.com/live/ tells me exactly what to do =/
00:30  scorphus: thanks ajpiano =)
00:30 @coldhead: IN YOUR FACE SNOVER
00:31 * coldhead np: tarentel - popul vuh
00:31  snover: thanks coldhead
00:34  thomasd: snover wen you use has own property you check for the property on the first prototype layer
00:35  thomasd: try this http://pastebin.com/54r6JhxD
00:38  snover: http://zetafleet.com/i/4cdb2cb81021f.png
00:38  snover: oops
00:38  sqlsolver: hello
00:38  sqlsolver: looking for a smart jquery person
00:39  snover: http://zetafleet.com/i/4cdb2cf6cb040.png
00:39  sqlsolver: having menu/tabs trouble on sqlsolver.com
00:40  sqlsolver: prob 1 is that last tab visited stays highlighted even after page refresh
00:40  sqlsolver: n problem 2 is that I'd like to have the top tabs open the accordion they select, instead of just highlighting it with a dashed line
00:44  sqlsolver: anyone experienced w/ tabs, accordions?
00:47  scorphus: heh... jquery is amazing!
00:47  Brodingo: #jquery is amazing
00:48  comhero: has anyone used yahoo yql with jquery to get around same origin policy
00:48  comhero: i'm working with an api that doesn't support jsonp
00:55 --- gothm0g is now known as balr0g
00:55  vispillo: comhero, yeah - i've done that
00:55  vispillo: hold on, i've got a demo site somewhere...
01:00  sqlsolver: any jquery aces with menus and accordions on board?
01:02  erichynds: ?someone @ sqlsolver
01:02  bot-t: sqlsolver, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
01:02  Shown: what is best: loading jquery on head
01:02  Shown: or at end of body?
01:03  sqlsolver: okay, asked ? above but no takers until you... at sql solver.com two problems: 1) last tab visited keeps a:visited color even after page refresh
01:03  vispillo: comhero: http://geopanda.vispillo.org/yql-demo.htm
01:04  sqlsolver: and 2) I want tabs to actually open accordion they select, not just highlight it with a dashed line
01:04  sqlsolver: I posted code for the problem at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4081555?tab=newest#tab-top
01:07  _numbers: what's the best way to do png fix for ie?
01:08  erichynds: _numbers, dd_belatedpng
01:10  _numbers: if i dynamically add markup that includes new transparent PNGs, do i have to keep calling DD_belatedPNG.fixPng() each time?
01:14 --- k1ng__ is now known as k1ng
01:22  abadr: Is there any way to cancel sorting in a sorting event handler?
01:22  abadr: I tried doing event.preventDefault in a sortstart handler, but that causes visual and JS errors
01:23  dabear: abadr:  $(this).sortable('cancel'); ?
01:23  emanu: is it possible to create a link, click it, then remove it?
01:23  emanu: is a .js file that is
01:23 @coldhead: ghostyyyyy headddd ohhhh ghostyyyy headddd
01:23  abadr: dabear: problem is right now I'm switching between read-only and editable with a top-level CSS class
01:23  abadr: was hoping my sortstart could just check for that class
01:24  abadr: now i'm going to have to fire an event or something
01:24  abadr: (I have many sortable collections on the page)
01:24  danheberden: emanu: sure, but you can't trigger a native click - you could just set window.location though
01:25  danheberden: window.location.href
01:25  emanu: danheberden: the thing is I have a rails.js file that will create a remote call when data-remote="true", which makes my life easier instead of creating an ajax request
01:25  comhero: vispillo, i need to use basic auth in combination with yql and jquery, any tips?
01:25  emanu: so if I could just create a link with data-remote="true", then I don't have to worry about re-implementing the xmlhttprequest
01:26  danheberden: sure
01:27  comhero: vispillo, http://fpaste.org/K6wg/ is as far as i've gotten and it doesn't work
01:28  vispillo: hmm
01:29  vispillo: can't really help with the basic auth end
01:29  comhero: vispillo, curl -u #{api_key}:x -X GET https://#{your_account}.batchbook.com/service/people.xml <-- this works of course
01:29  vispillo: i only dealt with the yql side of things
01:30  comhero: i'm wondering does yql accept base64 encoded auth headers?
01:30  comhero: in order to auth with the api on its end
01:31  vispillo: hmm. i went the oauth route
01:31  vispillo: hmm. i went the oauth route
01:31  comhero: yeah this api only supports basic auth :|
01:31  comhero: and no jsonp
01:32  comhero: so i'm at a loss how to use it on a seperate domain
01:32  comhero: i can't create a proxy api because this is gmail contextual widget code
01:35  mrlarner: is it possible to set the properties of an event object before triggering an event? for instance changing a target, or pageX/pageY?
01:35  erichynds: the object doesn't exist until it's been fired
01:36  mrlarner: can you specify these properties with the event constructor?
01:37 --- Serpiente_ is now known as Serpiente
01:37  erichynds: not to my knowledge
01:42  thomasd: hello everyone
01:42  thomasd: why has jquery never included cookie suport in it's core
01:43  l4rk: thomasd: because its not the job of jquery to bake your cookies
01:43  thomasd: -.-
01:44  danheberden: ya, that's totally coldhead's job
01:44 @coldhead: for the same reason it never included templating or validation
01:44  thomasd: witch is
01:44 @coldhead: its trying to keep the core simple
01:44  danheberden: well they could have been thoughtful and made it possible to make plugins that.. oh, wait.. they did
01:44 @coldhead: things that work as plugins should be plugins
01:44 @coldhead: especially with such a powerful and elegant plugin sustem
01:44 @coldhead: sys*
01:45 * coldhead np: don caballero - don caballero 3
01:49  emanu: can somebody explain why this doesn't work? $('<a href="/worksheets/' + wid + '/update_cell/' + row + '/' + col + '/' + asdf + '" data-remote="true" style="display:none;">Link</a>').click();
01:50 @coldhead: thomasd: maybe you could do a super paranoid + luxury jquery that has a better isPlainObject AND comes with cookies?
01:50  Lumpio-: ...why are you making a link and immediately simulating a click
01:50 @coldhead: i'd use that
01:50  Lumpio-: What's the point
01:50  danheberden: emanu: we already went over this
01:50  emanu: Lumpio-: there's jquery code that executes because of the 'data-remote=true'
01:50 @coldhead: explain it better, danheberden
01:51  emanu: danheberden: yea, but I can't get it to work without doing really ugly things like creating the link, appending it to the html, then removing it
01:51  danheberden: well, now i'm confused - so there is already an event handler on the a element?
01:51  emanu: I feel like there must be a better way
01:51  vispillo: hm - comhero, have you tried accessing that api via the yql console?
01:51 @coldhead: my favourite dired command is 'a'
01:52  emanu: danheberden: I think I've just been staring at this too long..
01:52  emanu: but I think I don't understand the core of jquery enough to figure this out
01:53  danheberden: it looks like you're working really hard to NOT just write the ajax call yourself
01:53  emanu: danheberden: does it make sense that I should create a link, .appendTo(), click it and delete it?
01:53  danheberden: instead of just making an ajax request
01:53  danheberden: emanu: not at all
01:53  danheberden: that would require a live event already on it
01:53  comhero: vispillo, no i'm using the xdomainajax jquery plugin, it apparently uses YQL for magic
01:54  XwZ: hi
01:54  vispillo: oh, right, i see
01:54  emanu: danheberden: yes, but I don't want to write ANOTHER ajax request if it's already written
01:54  vispillo: but still no joy?
01:54  danheberden: you shouldn't have to rewrite it
01:54  comhero: vispillo, no joy
01:55  danheberden: it should be de-coupled enough that it isn't bound to the THING that triggers it
01:55  XwZ: is it possible to add an handler to catch the new anchor with jquery ? without reload the page ?
01:55  danheberden: the A element just says "oh hai, i was clicked y'all" and your app responds
01:55  danheberden: so all you need to do is say "oh hai, i was clicked too baby"
01:56  vispillo: comhero: have you tried setting username and password in the properties of the ajax call? user being your app key and password is just something random
01:56  emanu: danheberden: so I simulate the link being clicked, instead of creating a link and clicking it?
01:56  XwZ: danheberden: isn't possible to listen document.location.hash ? instead of add an onclick attribute on all the link ?
01:56 @coldhead: danheberden: i don't really see how you can monetize that app
01:57  XwZ: danheberden: oups sorry, it wasn't for me :)
01:57  danheberden: i feel my brain swelling
01:57  emanu: danheberden: I know the feeling....
01:57  danheberden: emanu - where's the ajax call
01:57  comhero: vispillo, i have but not with the xdomainajax plugin. i can try that
01:57  danheberden: call the one you know is there
01:57  danheberden: you don't have to rewrite it, just call it
01:57  danheberden: function zomgDoMyAjax() {
01:58  comhero: vispillo, i get responseText: data.results[0] is undefined, as usual
02:00  vispillo: hm. is batchbook a free service? i'd sign up just to test, but not if they're gonna charge me :<
02:06  LakWork: vispillo from google:

02:07  LakWork: good day sir
02:08  Aliv3: http://pastebin.com/uVSejpn9 is making span#log blank
02:09  Aliv3: howcome
02:10  Aliv3: if i go to server.html?data=test it says test
02:13  IceD^: analog for jQ 1.4 .parseJSON in 1.3?
02:14  Aliv3: no
02:14  abadr: With a sortable, I ought to be able to call 'cancel' from the 'start' handler, right? Getting a JS error.
02:15  Lumpio-: I find it annoying that jQuery doesn't come with the opposite of parseJSON...
02:16  Lumpio-: It would require quite a bit of extra code, but the imbalance is awful
02:16  Aliv3: why is it returning null
02:16 --- MikhX_ is now known as MikhX
02:18  echosystm: how do i make a dialog with an anonymous selector?
02:18  echosystm: eg. $('#whatever').dialog(...
02:18  echosystm: but without the #whatever
02:18  echosystm: i just want to make a dialog
02:18  echosystm: nothing else
02:19  Lumpio-: Presumably by just creating a new element and then applying dialog on it
02:19  Lumpio-: $("<div />").dialog(...)
02:20  echosystm: thanks
02:21  Aliv3: n e 1 help me?
02:21  Lumpio-: n e 1 who nt wrt in txt spk?
02:22  Aliv3: c
02:22  echosystm: ok next question
02:22  echosystm: i need a table that can be sorted etc.
02:22  Aliv3: i need jquery.ajax to work
02:22  echosystm: and makes it easy to pull down data
02:22  echosystm: got any suggestions for plugins?
02:22  Lumpio-: "pull down data"?
02:23  echosystm: json
02:23  murz: http://www.datatables.net/
02:23  echosystm: something with good data binding
02:24  echosystm: i tried datatables but i couldnt get it working with jquery ui themes
02:24  echosystm: it just came out broken
02:24  murz: i don't think it is a jquery ui widget
02:24  Lumpio-: I like how the table at datatables.net says IE6 has "A grade" CSS support ¬__¬
02:24  Lumpio-: Well it uses the UI classes
02:25  Lumpio-: So you'd figure it does something with the theme system
02:25  murz: Yahoo still classifies IE6/WinXP as A-Grade: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/
02:25  Lumpio-: Yeah, I figured it's not their data originally
02:25  Lumpio-: Screw Yahoo then
02:26  Aliv3: why wont
02:26  joshsmith: What's a decent way to have a menu come up when you click on a button? I'm thinking of something in the style of Gmail's buttons, e.g. "More actions"
02:26  joshsmith: "Labels", etc.
02:26  Aliv3: jQuery.ajax work
02:26  murz: Aliv3: it does.
02:26  Lumpio-: Aliv3: Correction: Your code doesn't work.
02:26  joshsmith: Aliv3: It's called a "me" problem
02:26  Lumpio-: If jQuery.ajax was broken there'd be about seventy people complaining about it here right now
02:26  Lumpio-: Instead of just one
02:26  joshsmith: Lumpio-: just 70?
02:27 * coldhead np don caballero - p,p,p,antless
02:27  Aliv3: did you look at my code
02:27  Lumpio-: Yes, the rest would be complaining on the twitters and the other new-fangled social crap

02:29  dingding: Hello I would like to know how to correct the following: if(($('#image_form').children()) == undefined){alert('n')};
02:29  Aliv3: ack
02:29  Lumpio-: ...what are you trying to check for
02:30  Lumpio-: If #image_form doesn't have any children?
02:30  Lumpio-: $("#image_form").is(":empty")
02:30  dingding: Lumpio-: Basically, no it doesn't
02:30  dingding: ok let me try that
02:30  Lumpio-: Otherwise you're going to have to be a bit more specific
02:30  thinkfast: hey all, is there any reason why this would keep returning undefined even though the response from the ajax request returns a value?
02:30  thinkfast: http://pastebin.com/FvM8M6y0
02:30  seancurtis: is there a way to use the latest jquery from google's cdn?
02:30  iszak: sean`, yes?
02:31  seancurtis: I recall their being a way but can't find a reference to it
02:31  Lumpio-: seancurtis: Always the latest as opposed to the latest from when you added the reference?
02:31  seancurtis: as in /latest/jquery.js instead of /1.4.3/jquery.js
02:31  Lumpio-: seancurtis: Is there any point in doing that?
02:31  seancurtis: which would obviously be pointing to 1.4.3 currently
02:32  Lumpio-: thinkfast: I don't think you quite understand how functions work ¬__¬
02:32  seancurtis: just means I don't have to update it
02:32  seancurtis: ie when 1.4.4 is released I'll be running it straight away without having to go change it
02:32  thinkfast: i understand how functions work, just not javascript ones
02:32  SundanceKid: hello people. $(this).find('div.placeholderControls').remove();   what should I change in selector to limit a deep of search?  To exclude indirect chidren.
02:32  thinkfast: thats how it would work in php
02:33  thinkfast: define function, retrieve data, return data
02:33  seancurtis: SundanceKid: you're already limiting scope by using .find
02:33  seancurtis: SundanceKid: maybe you need to be more specific or do another find?
02:33  thinkfast: what would i have to do to get it to work
02:34  Aliv3: jsfiddle says im valid
02:34  echosystm: can anyone recommend me a js framework that has more widgets?
02:34  echosystm: this datatables thing doesnt work
02:34  dingding: Lumpio-: I am trying to prove a true case and therefore send an alert dialog if there are no children of #image_form. I tried if(($('#image_form').children()) == undefined){alert('n')}; and then if(($('#image_form').children()).is(":empty")){alert('n')}; Both do not seem to work in chrome dev console
02:34  SundanceKid: seancurtis, I don't need the matching elements insiide of childen.
02:35  Lumpio-: dingding: ...but you didn't use the code I gave you
02:35  Lumpio-: SundanceKid: .find(">div.placeholderControls")
02:35  kenthree: is there a shortcut to find an undeclared width? basically innerWidth - paddings
02:35  SundanceKid: Lumpio-: thank you very much!
02:35  Lumpio-: thinkfast: You're expecting a value returned from function B to magically be returned by function A. It doesn't work like that.
02:36  dingding: Lumpio-: hmm I tried using it as if(($('#image_form').children()).is(":empty")){alert('n')}; Am I using it incorrectly?
02:36  Lumpio-: kenthree: .width() ?
02:36  Lumpio-: dingding: I clearly said $("#image_form").is(":empty") ; you did ($('#image_form').children()).is(":empty")
02:36  Lumpio-: You're doing it wrong.
02:37  murz: seancurtis: you can get the latest version of a branch
02:37  murz: seancurtis: if you just use /1/ it will give you the latest release of jquery version1 (which is 1.4.3)
02:37  dingding: Lumpio-: oops sorry I misread. let me retry
02:37  murz: when 1.4.4 is released it will use that, but when 2.0.0 is released it wont
02:38  kenthree: Lumpio-: afaik that wont work if it isnt in the stylesheet
02:38  dingding: Lumpio-: thanks for your help that worked!
02:38  thinkfast: how would i then pass the response out of the ajax function into the parent function so i can return it/
02:39  murz: you can't, the function can return before the asynchronous ajax function has a response
02:39  Lumpio-: kenthree: Did you try it?
02:39  Aliv3: brb
02:39  Lumpio-: thinkfast: You could kludge it together with synchronous requests, but they're a bad idea. Learn about event based programming
02:40  Lumpio-: In even based programming you don't wait for something that possibly takes a while to be done before continuing with execution
02:40  Lumpio-: You rather let it run (in, from your perspective, another thread) and have it call a function when it's done
02:40  Lumpio-: Somebody probably has a clever link about it
02:41  iszak: coldhead, got a moment?
02:42 @coldhead: sure
02:52  iszak: coldhead, pm it? it's an image.
02:53 @coldhead: okey
02:55  Aliv3: hi coldhead
02:58  Aliv3: ok here
02:58 @coldhead: hi Aliv3
02:58  Aliv3: so say i ajax a html page with javascript
02:58  Aliv3: will it just return the script or will it run it and modify it according to the javascript then return the output
02:59 @coldhead: ajax strips javascript out
02:59 @coldhead: if you .ajax() fetch a page with <script>alert('hi!')</script>
02:59 @coldhead: you won't see the alert
03:00  Aliv3: aww
03:00  Aliv3: how do i make it work
03:01  Aliv3: wait even so i have:<span id="output">Server Error</span>, and javascript changes it to say something else, so shouldnt it say server error?
03:01  seancurtis: Aliv3: do you mean will the JS change it before it's returned in the ajax call?
03:02  seancurtis: Aliv3: when you request the html page with ajax it'll pull the html and drop the JS so you get whatever was in the html page
03:02  erichynds: the js won't execute dawg
03:02  Harris: hey all
03:02  seancurtis: Aliv3: move whatever JS you want to run into the success callback of the ajax call
03:03  Aliv3: its kinda hard to explain what im trying to do
03:03  Aliv3: if i showed you guys the files would you look at them?
03:03  Harris: sure
03:06  Aliv3: http://pastebin.com/11aW5RWx , http://pastebin.com/J1JLbWKM , http://pastebin.com/395tEAwm
03:07  Harris: doesn't really explain still what your trying to do..
03:09  amh345: can anyone tell me why this js causes my div "#info_1" to flicker when i hover over #.div_test? http://pastebin.com/xei95M7A
03:10  Phrogz__: Without looking at the code, I guess you're alternative mouseover/out
03:10  Phrogz__: s/alternating
03:10  Harris: amh345
03:10  amh345: im using .hover()
03:10  Harris: you trying to make a popup box?
03:11  amh345: Harris: harris, im trying to make a popup of sorts. i want to roll over some text and have a window show beside it with links.  and when i roll out of the div the winodw should disappear.
03:11  Phrogz__: amh345: Yes - and you move the box under the mouse, and so the test div gets a mouseout, and so it goes away, and so you're over the test, and...
03:11  amh345: i wrote something with mouseover and it had the same issue. i did some reading and i was under the impression that hover fixed the flciker problem.
03:12  Aliv3: mouseover == mouse hover i thought??
03:13  amh345: is there a special name for what im trying to do? i've tried searching tooltips.. but it isnt really working out.
03:13  Aliv3: Harris: so can you help?
03:14  Aliv3: whatabout jquery tools
03:14  erichynds: hover is mouseenter/mouseleave
03:14  Harris: yea
03:14  amh345: i suppose i could go to any number of sites that have rthis feature and just copy it.. but i'd really like to do it myself.
03:14  Harris: what erichynds said
03:14  Aliv3: http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html
03:15 @coldhead: ah, the missing user interface lib for the web
03:15  amh345: this kind of does what i want http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/any-html.html

03:39  erichynds: crescendo, so what is tmpl() returning?  does it generate a template? any errors?
03:40  erichynds: i'm guessing there's an error in your template preventing it from compiling
03:40  crescendo: erichynds, an object, yeah
03:40  crescendo: And that would make sense.
03:40  crescendo: Perhaps it is failing if not all variables are present

03:45  Aliv3: MY BRAIN ITCHES
03:46  MnMs: get a lobotomy
03:46 @coldhead: sorry thinkfast
03:47  progrock: my brain isn;t doing so well this week
03:47  MnMs: the a stands for asynchronous
03:47  progrock: tok me over 2 hours for a simple equation http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y+%3D+5*(sqrt(1-(1-(x*3/5+%2B+0.4))^2)-0.8)+for+0+%3C+x+%3C+1
03:47  erichynds: amh345, it might be in the download zip, but you still have to include it
03:47  thinkfast: is there a non-asynchronous way i can use to do this?
03:48  erichynds: don't use sync requests for the love of god
03:48  erichynds: thinkfast, put the shit that relies on the response inside the success callback
03:48  MnMs: you can include async: false in the options
03:48  erichynds: no, don't do that
03:48  MnMs: but that will block the ui until its donme
03:48  MnMs: done*
03:49  thinkfast: hmm
03:49  thinkfast: i tried putting what relies on the response in the success callback and it stuffed everything else up
03:50  erichynds: thinkfast, you can also use named functions for organization... like: function handleResponse(){}; $.get("foo.htm", handleResponse);
03:59 @coldhead: seancurtis: my entire office just went to grill'd for their movember freebies
04:00  snover: coldhead: including the women?
04:00  Harris: :o
04:00  Harris: coldhead, what did they include
04:01  Harris: free stickers?
04:02  emanu: so I have a <table> with a bunch of <td contenteditable="true"> cells. I want to save content of cells so I attached a $('td').bind('focusout', function save_cell()) (simplified obviously..) which saves the cell info. However, once I'm no longer editing any cell in the table, I want to attach an event to reload the page. What event should I bind to make this go smoothly and what element should I bind it to?
04:02 @coldhead: i don't know, Harris
04:02 @coldhead: i don't have a moe
04:02 @coldhead: no snover, the women folk are all giving blood
04:02  emanu: does that make sense also... not sure if I'm explaining myself properly
04:03 @coldhead: i know that sounds like a metaphor but...
04:03  snover: emanu: I think you are confusing what “an event” is
04:03  emanu: snover: how so?
04:03 --- fabiomcosta_ is now known as fabiomcosta
04:04  snover: Attaching an event does not perform an action like reloading the page
04:04  snover: it just attaches a listener to an event
04:04  emanu: snover: yes yes, I know. I got that part
04:04  emanu: I just don't know what even to attach my reload code to.
04:04  emanu: for example... I attached a 'focusout' event to <table>, hoping that when I clicked away from an editable <td>, the table would reload
04:05  emanu: but the event never gets fired, because a focusout event is bound to the <td> and it returns false so that it doesn't bubble up to table
04:05  snover: what events does designmode provide?
04:05  emanu: designmode?
04:06  emanu: interesting...
04:07  emanu: but I don't need so much thanks to html5's contenteditable="true"
04:08  emanu: I just have the following requirements: if I unfocus from a cell, fire off a save command in the bg. If I unfocus from ANY cell in the table, reload the whole table.
04:10  emanu: you follow?
04:10  snover: um
04:11 --- Phrogz__ is now known as Phrogz_
04:11  snover: you are necessarily unfocusing “any” cell when you switch from one to the next
04:11  emanu: that's the problem
04:12  emanu: but if I hit tab, I just want it to save the cell I just left in a bg ajax call, and keep editing
04:12  emanu: whereas if I reload the whole table, my cursor disappears
04:12  emanu: so I want to be able to tab through every cell in the table, and then reload the whole thing once I unfocus from all cells
04:13  emanu: I feel maybe logically I'm binding my actions to the wrong events
04:13  emanu: any suggestions?
04:15  snover: reloading everything when someone unfocuses seems like not really the right thing to do
04:15  snover: but
04:15  emanu: so what would be a good way to design this?
04:15  emanu: I'm making an excel-style grid
04:16  snover: maybe you should just use google docs ;)
04:16  emanu: hehe, great idea... *rolls eyes*
04:16  snover: or slickgrid or one of the other already existing similar things
04:16  emanu: unfortunately that's not an option
04:16  snover: Either way if you insist on doing it on a blur, you could setTimeout the actual function that performs the reload
04:17  snover: and then clearTimeout when a focus happens
04:17  joshsmith: does anyone have some high-level thoughts on how to bring up a menu when you click a button (e.g. Gmail's buttons)
04:17  joshsmith: I'm just not sure of a good pattern for doing that
04:17  snover: joshsmith: I recommend displaying a menu when the user clicks on a button
04:17  joshsmith: snover: wow, thanks! never thought of that
04:17  snover: you said high-level.
04:17  joshsmith: snover: true enough
04:17  nimbupani: :D
04:17  emanu: snover: maybe I don't need it on a blur then..
04:18  emanu: or maybe I should treat each cell individually
04:18  emanu: and load them all via ajax requests
04:18  joshsmith: http://www.flickr.com/photos/joshsmith/5165319533/
04:18  thinkfast: finally found a way around it
04:18  thinkfast: but :D
04:18  thinkfast: $('#slideshow').children('img').is(':visible').attr('src');
04:19  thinkfast: that dosnt seem to work to get the src of the visible img under #slideshow?
04:19  thinkfast: or do i use find()
04:19  erichynds: thinkfast, what's ur DOM structure look like?
04:20  erichynds: also
04:20  erichynds: is() returns a boolean
04:20  thinkfast: ah
04:20  erichynds: i think you want filter()
04:20  thinkfast: <div id="slideshow"><img src="" /></div>
04:21  thinkfast: $('#slideshow').children('src').filter(':visible').attr('src');
04:21  erichynds: s/src/img
04:21  erichynds: children("img:visible")
04:22  thinkfast: it works! haha

04:29  xcoder: hehe
04:29  xcoder: alright
04:29  xcoder: i have an input text
04:29  xcoder: and i wanna save the dom of the page in a file
04:29  l4rk: you wanna do what
04:29  erichynds: twss
04:29  xcoder: but when i try to save it, i get the original value="STUFF"
04:29  erichynds: amirite?
04:29  xcoder: i want the text he's entering now to be in the value="..."
04:30  xcoder: how can i do that
04:30  joshsmith: coldhead: what I was trying to figure out was the best way to try to pop something over the rest of the content (not have it be inline), and appear directly under the button
04:30  erichynds: xcoder, that makes no sense
04:31  xcoder: what is it that isn't clear ?
04:31  l4rk: well you said you wanted to save the dom in a file
04:31  l4rk: which isn't clear at all
04:31  erichynds: ^
04:31  xcoder: well
04:31  xcoder: if i alert my input tag html
04:31  xcoder: i get
04:31  erichynds: and "he" is entering text in an input
04:31  xcoder: <input ... value="the value that was in when the document was loaded" />
04:32  xcoder: i want that when i alert the html of the input

04:32  l4rk: cosmicdreams: i don't know what you mean by that but sure!
04:32  xcoder: how can i update the dom (inside firebug) to have the updated value attribute
04:32  cosmicdreams: I'm new here,
04:33  erichynds: so um you want to grab the defaultValue property i think?
04:33  xcoder: no
04:33  cosmicdreams: ok, cool
04:34  xcoder: i want to grab the current value in the browser
04:34  xcoder: and put it in the DOM (as in if i alert the innerhtml of the form)
04:35  erichynds: i'm even more confused than i was before
04:35  xcoder: lol
04:35  xcoder: alright
04:35  xcoder: i'll pastebin it
04:35  erichynds: what do you mean when you say DOM?
04:35  xcoder: let me show you
04:35  erichynds: do you really mean value?
04:36  xcoder: wait gimme a minute
04:36  xcoder: you know what firebug is right ?
04:36  freedgy: Hi everyone, how can I use live() to attach a jquery plugin? I'm using a little color picker script I want to attach to any future elements. Seen here: http://pastie.org/1288908  Thanks!
04:36  erichynds: yes
04:37  paul_irish: probably wanna use livequery plugin
04:37  paul_irish: easiest.
04:37  paul_irish: there are better ways though
04:38  freedgy: Using live() doesn't seem to work the same as with click, as with $.fn plugins.. or am I just reading the docs wrong?
04:38  freedgy: Thanks paul_irish, I'll take a look.
04:38  xcoder: problem solved
04:38  xcoder: thanks anyway :)
04:39  erichynds: cool
04:39  ajpiano: freedgy, you are right
04:39 --- Dantman is now known as Ikamusuko
04:40  ajpiano: .live can only be run directly against a selector
04:41  freedgy: How is livequery any different? Does registering a plugin with livequery accomplish this? As stated at the bottom: http://brandonaaron.net/code/livequery/docs
04:47  freedgy: Even calling the plugin from within the $.post() callback does not attach it to my new dynamic content that's just been loaded. Any ideas?

05:25  xcoder: how can i remove an html element from the dom
05:25  xcoder: without using jquery ?
05:25  xcoder: (pure javascript)
05:25  kn0wn: coldhead: a computer scientist such as yourself should've known about it.

05:29 @coldhead: and it doesn't work across browsers
05:29  kn0wn: coldhead: then you shouldn't be talking
05:30 @coldhead: also kn0wn you don't want to give it a string, give it an anonymous function

05:34  Phrogz_: mauser: You can either a) Perform synchronous ajax (ugh, no!) which will completely lock up the user's browser while making the request, or b) redesign your workflow.
05:35  echosystm: why does jquery suck so bad?
05:36  echosystm: theres no inbuilt way to turn off scrollbars on dialogs.

05:37  kn0wn: .error isn't working either
05:37  echosystm: rage!
05:38 @coldhead: try/catch, kn0wn ?
05:38  mauser: Phrogz_: There are a lot of places in the code that use checkLogin already. How will sync ajax change checkLogin?
05:39  Phrogz_: kn0wn: Enlighten me: when do you think onerror fires, and what are you trying to do with it?
05:39  Phrogz_: mauser: Use FireBug or Chrome/Safari Developer Tools to find out. Of course, this will vary based on internet connection and route to our server.
05:39  kn0wn: Phrogz: from what i understand, onerror flies when an image cannot be loaded, and i'm trying to show a default image in place when the aforementioned occurs
05:40  hLVEHEART: I need teh help.
05:40  hLVEHEART: http://jsbin.com/ugowo/3 -- Basically, on page load it's refreshing the starting point with Math.floor(Math.random()*carouselLi.length);... but when it loops around back to its' starting point, it starts misbehaving
05:40  mauser: Phrogz_, I meant how will it change the logic. sync ajax call lockup is acceptable
05:42  Phrogz_: mauser: Actually, I dunno; I've never tried sync ajax to see how the return value is handled. If nothing else you could just define a local variable in checkLogin, latch it to the closure of the 'callback', and have the callback modify that before checkLogin returns it.
05:45  mauser: Phrogz_: I tried local variable already but could not modify it from callback, could not access it (scope). I will try. Thank you
05:46  Phrogz_: mauser: function checkLogin(fn){ var foo; $.post( ..., function(data){ foo = fn() } ); return foo }  // with synchronous variation
05:46 * hLVEHEART is confused beyond words
05:50  hLVEHEART: k, so anyone able to help me?
05:50  hLVEHEART: o.o
05:51  Phrogz_: hLVEHEART: Looks too much like in-depth debugging. Pare it down more.
05:54  hLVEHEART: basically what it's doing is when the page refreshes, a variable is made with var carouselamt = Math.floor(Math.random()*carouselLi.length);
05:54  Phrogz_: You said that already.
05:55  hLVEHEART: The variable is then put inside the start: position of the carousel. which works great. functions fine. but as soon as the list circles through again to the starting point, the image bounces left and starts at a different int.
05:55  Phrogz_: Pare it down. More more more.
05:57  hLVEHEART: I'm wondering how I would even go about doing that, ;\.
05:57  Phrogz_: Find a line of code. Delete it. Make it 3 items instead of ?
05:58  Phrogz_: Step through the code one line at a time and look at the locals and watch windows. Validate your assumptions.

06:32  ajpiano: that's what "OR" means
06:32  ajpiano: you can have one, the other, or both

06:51  joshsmith: http://jsfiddle.net/P4nqv/
06:51  joshsmith: and by "better" I mean potentially anything
06:52  ajpiano: joshsmith: you need to learn about caching selectors
06:52  ajpiano: that is evinced by both this snippet and the thing i recall from the other night
06:52  joshsmith: I'm all ears
06:52  ajpiano: $(".foo") is not some kind of lookup in a hashtable
06:52  joshsmith: quite honestly; I'm still very new to jQuery
06:52  ajpiano: it's an operation, a potentailly costly one
06:53  ajpiano: if you are trying to reuse the same elements, you should save the jquery object in a variable
06:53  ajpiano: var theseguys = $(".thoseguys');
06:53  joshsmith: so does the same go for $(this) ?
06:53  ajpiano: definitely the same for this
06:53  ajpiano: joshsmith: it's easy to understand why it's costly if you think of a simple example
06:54  ajpiano: imagine i put a mousemove handler on the document, so every single time the mouse moves a pixel, there's an event
06:54  ajpiano: and i want to move some element on the page to track the mouse
06:55  ajpiano: i could either do var foo = $("#foo");  $(document).mousemove(function(e) { foo.offset(e);  }) and call document.getElementById once
06:55  ajpiano: or
06:55  ajpiano: i could do what most people who are new to jquery do and do $(document).mousemove(function(e) { $("#foo").offset(e);   });
06:55  ajpiano: and literally call document.getElementById thousands of times a second

06:56  chovy: or name();'

06:58  chovy: ajpiano: thanks
06:58  joshsmith: I'm at nearly 5k lines of code, so I'm way past the point of needing to have things much more organized, DRY, etc.
06:58  ajpiano: joshsmith: i bet you could learn a lot about organisatio if you just focused on moving things around so that you cache sets of elements the first time you use them, and then use those references in the other places in the app
06:58 @coldhead: i pity the fool who inherits THAT project

07:02  Brodingo: you cant just add styles to your main stylesheet?
07:02  joshsmith: I remember Rebecca used $this = $(this) to cache inside a block of code; are there downsides to that apporach?
07:02  ajpiano: there are downsides if you don't use a var statement :)
07:02  werdna: ah, here we go
07:02  werdna: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-getscript-12-1-2010
07:02 @coldhead: lol
07:02  joshsmith: ah yeah I meant var $this = $(this)
07:03 @coldhead: the downside is no one can come along later and go "ooh i can speed this code up, i'll use cacheing!"
07:03 @coldhead: you're denying work to consultants
07:03 @coldhead: you monster
07:03  seancurtis: joshsmith: people use the $ in front of the var name to indicate that it's a jquery object
07:03  blindingdawn:  I am trying to use Nivo Slider (http://nivo.dev7studios.com/) to do a rotating banner and it's coming out wrong http://71.236.191.74/ any anyone offer any suggestions?
07:04  seancurtis: eg var $tabs = $('.tabs'); versus: var time = "beer time";
07:04  joshsmith: seancurtis: and it *is* a jQuery object in that instance, correct?
07:04  ajpiano: coldhead: http://thedailywtf.com/Comments/The-Speedup-Loop.aspx
07:04  Brodingo: instead of another request why not just add a parent type class that activates some cascaded styles
07:04  seancurtis: joshsmith: as long as you don't reassign it yes
07:05  Brodingo: oh shi
07:05  joshsmith: seancurtis: heh, well, I'm not sure I'd have a good reason to reassign anything to $this
07:05  seancurtis: eg var $tabs = $('.tabs'); would allow you to chain the variable like so: $tabs.find('.foo'); but if you reassign the var like so: $tabs = "beer time" you would obviously no longer have a jquery object
07:05  joshsmith: yeah, I got you
07:06  seancurtis: do you other guys commonly use $this or do you make it meaningful?
07:06  seancurtis: eg $tabs
07:06  ajpiano: seancurtis: it's a slippery slope
07:06  joshsmith: I've actually done both, e.g. $checkboxes = $('.all-checkboxes');
07:07  ajpiano: most people i know, including me
07:07  ajpiano: start off by doing var $this = $(this), etc
07:07  ajpiano: and then you want it to be meaningful
07:07  ajpiano: and then you realise the $ looks stupid all the time
07:07  ajpiano: and you're rarely ever caching dom elements, just jQuery objects
07:08  seancurtis: so ajpiano do you use $this or "that"
07:08  joshsmith: sounds like that
07:08  seancurtis: some of my coworkers do var that = $(this);
07:08  ajpiano: and why would you want an object that's like mywidget = { $controls:$("#controls"), $content: $(".content") }
07:08  seancurtis: true
07:09  ajpiano: lately i typically just do var t = $(this)
07:09  joshsmith: if I'm doing var next_task = $('.tipsy-task').parent('.task').nextAll('.task:first');, then do I need to do $(next_task).length, or just next_task.length?
07:09  ajpiano: that's cause i am always writing really short examples or just lazy
07:09  ajpiano: joshsmith, the latter
07:09  ajpiano: don't re-jquery a jQuery
07:09  seancurtis: was just about to ask that ajpiano - considering minification as opposed to compression you'd want your var names to be short as possible right
07:09  joshsmith: ajpiano: ah, that simplifies things significantly
07:10  ajpiano: joshsmith: yeah, you can definitely think of things as like, ok, get the elements that i want to work with, store them all together, and then connect them to each other
07:10  ajpiano: instead of just a hairy mess of constant dom selection
07:10  seancurtis: I loved reading over that winning js1k entry - it broke my fucking brain, but in a good way
07:11  ajpiano: seancurtis: yeah, and i just know that i'm not typically using t for anything else and it's quick n easy
07:11  ajpiano: hahaha that shit in tents
07:11  seancurtis: haha
07:11  joshsmith: apologies for the epic noobishness here (and apologies to whatever poor guy comes after me)
07:11  seancurtis: everyone's here to learn joshsmith ... well apart from coldhead ... he's just here for the booze
07:12  joshsmith: boy, is he ever
07:12 @coldhead: and how
07:13  joshsmith: well I wanted to write some new code, but now I'm all hell-bent on refactoring
07:13  EspadaV8_W: hey, i was wondering if it's possible to compare 2 objects easily. e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/rMYGD/
07:15  seancurtis: if (a === b)?
07:15  joshsmith: so if I have $('#task-editor') cached as var task_editor, then how would I rewrite this: $('#task-editor input') ?
07:15  seancurtis: joshsmith: task_editor.find('input');
07:15  joshsmith: task_editor.find('input')? or just cache
07:16  seancurtis: var the input result if you're going to reuse it
07:16  seancurtis: cyas later - home time!!!11one
07:16  joshsmith: yeah, I'll have to see if it's used elsewhere

07:28  Superman_: ajpiano am i right?
07:28  ajpiano: harovali1, the point of that usage is to execute a function in a closure
07:29  ajpiano: by passing jQuery in as a parameter, and using $ as the name of the argument

10:20  negev: hi, im using the shake plugin  http://docs.jquery.com/index.php?title=UI/Effects/Shake  but if i call shake on a div, and then focus the username box straight after, the focus doesn't happen. is there a way to hook the event when it finishes shaking?  im guessing it does the shaking as a callback which steals focus somehow
10:22  temp01: .effect() has a callback parameter

11:00  vidarw: Hi. I'm looking for a way to manipulate my Disqus setup with jquery. I think the async loading of disqus causes a few problems. any suggestions on how to wait for the disqus script to properly load?
11:00  monkeynut: kelye, you can use $('stuff').get(index); to get the actual js element
11:01  timing: yeah and if you are sure it's just one element, user get(0);
11:01  monkeynut: kelye, what timing said for the first matched element
11:01  kelye: ok, thanks for the info
11:01  kelye: good to know for future
11:01  kelye: but my loop works ok :D
11:02  timing: o if you call it without any parms, you get all the elements
11:02  monkeynut: vidarw, what is Disqus? can you give us a link?
11:03  monkeynut: if Disqus is javascript and any good it should have a callback function for when it has finished setting up, put whatever has to happen afterwards in there
11:03  vidarw: monkeynut, its a comment system (http://disqus.com/overview/)
11:03  monkeynut: I meant a link to your site/code

11:08  vidarw: monkeynut, so what i basically want to do is to do stuff like $("#dsq-global-toolbar").hide(); after their script is loaded and executed
11:10  monkeynut: vidarw, I understand, was just looking at the api and it all looks like rubbish.  I'll see if I can spot what you need or a workaround on your site, otherwise I might have to leave this to someone else (or your powers of google ... if you can find a 'Im done' callback in the API, just put it there)
11:10  pashmi: Hi  there, I am new to jquery it is amazing i am loving it :), in animate function what should I use for height property to slide once (not togglt) here:    container.animate({

11:19  pashmi: I am not sure if i have compeltely understand your question but i know the first couple line looks silly but form some reasons i was getting undefined (in alert) instead of object
11:20  pashmi: so I had to use if condition
11:20  JKarsrud: pashmi, and what on earth does that empty anonymous function in your animates do?
11:21  kelye: here's one that i don't know
11:21  pashmi: I dont know I copy the animate code from jquery website :(

11:21  JKarsrud: there*
11:21  pashmi: thought meant to be like that
11:21  kelye: is it possible to create an element (like dom createElement) and then retrieve that element?
11:22  JKarsrud: kelye: store it in a var?
11:22  kelye: to do something like  .... e = $('<div></div>'); something.appendChild(e);
11:22  kelye: appendChild (dom method) is not accepting e
11:22  JKarsrud: What is the error?
11:22  JKarsrud: is something a jquery object?
11:23  kelye: Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy" code: "3
11:23  JKarsrud: okay
11:24  JKarsrud: use var e = document.createElement("div") then?
11:24  pashmi: ok what should I use instead of toggle for height to slide, well basically I want to make is to work with mousein and mouseout instead of click
11:24  JKarsrud: kelye: Do you have some code you could paste at jsfiddle.net or something?
11:25  JKarsrud: pashmi: Use the .hover-function, and just use slideUp and slideDown

12:06  sean`: whatm messages
12:07  BMCouto: :|
12:07  BMCouto: have you checked your email?
12:10  monkeynut: Birliban, don't do it!
12:10  Birliban: monkeynut, can js not handle that much data?
12:10  monkeynut: Birliban, use something other than a dropdown
12:10  monkeynut: for one thing it will be absolutely horrible for your users
12:10  monkeynut: for another, most browsers will crash out
12:11  monkeynut: also, how are you adding them? all at once is *much* more efficient than one at a time
12:11  Birliban: monkeynut, ok... they can filter as well, than the result is reduced, but if one user wants all, he shuld get it
12:11  monkeynut: Birliban, I suggest you look at the dataTables plugin ... use a table or list or something more suitable
12:11  monkeynut: dataTables does live filtering for you
12:11  monkeynut: can do ajax
12:11  monkeynut: i've used it for large lists with large amounts of info
12:11  Birliban: i know... but i cant use a table...
12:12  monkeynut: why can't you use a table?
12:12  Birliban: it is a part of a form...
12:12  Birliban: cant use that much entries in a table
12:12  Birliban: inside a form ^^
12:12  monkeynut: so, you can still have once the user clicks on the table cell/row, js populates a hidden <input> field in your form
12:13  Birliban: but your thought about putting it all at once sounds interesting...
12:13  Birliban: i iterate every entry now by appending to the select field
12:13  monkeynut: oh my god that's hideous! :P
12:14  Mimo: sean`: i understand but first question should i check wheter my selector exsist
12:14  sean`: YES
12:14  sean`: but cache your selector
12:14  sean`: var $foo = $('#foo');
12:14  sean`: if ($foo.length) { $foo.mofo (); }
12:14  monkeynut: Birliban, if possible, put it together server side, if not, in your each loop just concatenate the <option>blah</option> into one big string and append it all at once, one time
12:14  Mimo: haha oke that's what i did wanted to know
12:15  Mimo: so many thank sean`  and thanks for you patience
12:15  Mimo: had some trouble in my head
12:15  Superman_: ..
12:15  monkeynut: Birliban, that *should* work without becoming unresponsive, but one last urge to think of the users, have an easier to use list and use js to populate a hidden <input> so your form submits exactly that data, but your users don't have to scroll a mahooosive list. good luck :)
12:15  Birliban: monkeynut, but i need the jquery.data() in every option field... how to manage this?
12:16  monkeynut: Birliban, do you have code on pastebin?
12:16  Birliban: sure... wait...
12:20  Arimil: How can i remove a css rule? Something like $(".thread").css("background",""); works for changing the value but not for removing it.

12:22  Birliban: ;-)
12:23  monkeynut: hmmm... Birliban, why do you want to put the data in there? you've got a lot of redundancy going on.
12:23  pashmi: does slideUp works from bottom to top? with position absolute, bottom: 0px ??
12:23  monkeynut: you write lots of values from your array into the option element and then you store the whole thing in it anyway ...
12:24 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
12:24  Birliban: monkeynut, there is additional data in the json object that is not written in the option. ids etc.
12:24  monkeynut: If you really want to retain the whole thing, store it in a js object, a global one if you have to.
12:25  monkeynut: then you just need to make sure the index is in the tag, for quick access to that data
12:25  monkeynut: then you could remove the .data alltogether, concatenate the string and just push j[i] into your var. Then you have everything you need without burning people's cpu/memory resources
12:26  Arimil: Hm, $('blah').css('background',false); doesn't seem to be working.
12:26  monkeynut: verstehen sie? oder muss ich dir code geben?
12:26  Birliban: monkeynut, could you help me out with some code for the object etc.
12:26  Birliban: monkeynut, ein code wäre super!
12:27  Birliban: monkeynut, but that sounds really good
12:27  monkeynut: Arimil, do you want to remove all css or just a specific item? I really thought that worked, certainly does in a lot of cases, what browser you using?
12:27  Birliban: Birliban, i think .data() works well for small amounts of data
12:28  monkeynut: Birliban, give me a few minutes and i'll knock something up on your pastebin.

13:04 * doonie sneezes in himself's face
13:04  JKarsrud: html works on jquery objects, this is a normal js object :)
13:04  doonie: hehe awsome grammar in script
13:04  monkeynut: Arimil, that's what makes it a jquery object so you can use jquery methos ;)
13:04  Arimil: Yeah, I knew that I'm just stupid and was unsure if I needed it there.
13:05  JKarsrud: doonie: which script? :)
13:05  doonie: secret :P
13:05  JKarsrud: oh noes!
13:05  JKarsrud: http://www.b-leaf.it/
13:05  JKarsrud: Who needs jquery when you have css3? :)
13:05  Birliban: monkeynut, you are right... but i do not know how to solve this better. i have a database with contacts in it. the application is there to make an appointment. for this the user needs to selecta a contact. there is a search, but also the dropdown with all users. the user wants to have this dropdown to scroll trough contacts... how to solve it better ;-)
13:06  doonie: cool JKarsrud :)
13:06  monkeynut: Birliban, look at my first suggestions:   DATATABLES!!!
13:06  JKarsrud: not my work, but still cool!
13:06  Arimil: Hm, even after changing it, it's giving an unexpected identifier error. http://pastebin.com/PZG0jm4L
13:06  doonie: yea
13:06  doonie: I figured that out :p
13:06  sean`: yeah
13:06  monkeynut: Birliban, if you'd used datatables from the start, that part would have only required a few lines of code
13:06  JKarsrud: doonie: you don't think I have the skills?
13:07  doonie: no way jose!
13:07  JKarsrud: Arimil: not $('this')
13:07  JKarsrud: $(this)
13:07  Arimil: T_T sorry
13:07  JKarsrud: no worries :)
13:07  monkeynut: Birliban, it can automatically ajax fetch pages of data from the server, has a search filter, doesn't need to load all at once, quite reliable, lots of options for users to easily find contacts
13:07  Birliban: monkeynut, what do you mean exactly with datatables? just normal html tables with data in it?
13:07  monkeynut: nope, google it ;)
13:07  monkeynut: datatables is a great jquery plugin
13:07  Arimil: Still didn't work though lol
13:07  JKarsrud: ?g "jquery datatables" @ Birliban
13:08  bot-t: Birliban, DataTables (table plug-in for jQuery) - http://www.datatables.net/
13:08  monkeynut: cheers JKarsrud , is there a full list of bot commands for bot-t floating around?
13:08  JKarsrud: Arimil: Do you get any error messages?
13:08  JKarsrud: monkeynut: dunno, ask sean` :P
13:08  Arimil: unexpected identifier

13:09 --- SinusPi_ is now known as SinusPi
13:09  Arimil: Yeah, sure.
13:09  Birliban: monkeynut, hmm, ok but as i told, i have to build this inside a form... so when user is creating an schedule entry, he selects date and time and the contact...
13:10  JKarsrud: Kindof hard to know where the error is when we can't see the code :)
13:10  JKarsrud: Birliban: If you create a table, you could always set a height to it, and overflow:scroll
13:10  monkeynut: Birliban, I understand, i've done exactly what you are doing but with lists of around 1000 tasks.
13:11  monkeynut: the only other trick you need, which you only need for manual form submission, is whatever the user selected should cause a hidden input field written into the form. alternatively, put checkboxes in the table and you will also have your data
13:12  Birliban: JKarsrud, sure, i could also do a div popup e.g.
13:14  Arimil: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgYLv/
13:14  Birliban: monkeynut, the datatables are awesome... but the demo works with 58 entries... what if there are thousands...

13:15  monkeynut: I've got one with around 1000, if you look on pagespeed, most of the time is actually waiting for the data to be received. nothing you can do about that but get better servers and pipes ;)
13:16  Birliban: btw. you guys are awesome too! this channel has helped me in so many cases... thanks for that to all the helpers ;-)

13:17  JKarsrud: So the selector isn't working
13:18  Birliban: monkeynut, ok... i'll try this one out ;-) my boss will hit me, if i tell him that i need a 'bit more time' ;-)
13:18  JKarsrud: Birliban: Tell him it's the best thing to do for the users
13:18  Arimil: Huh?
13:18  JKarsrud: Arimil: The selector doesn't return any results
13:18  JKarsrud: even though there are two links in your fiddle
13:19  Cork: Husar: do a $.get, in the callback use append and add your content to the div see ?.append and see ?.get
13:19  bot-t: Husar, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/

13:19  Cork: BAH...
13:19  Birliban: JKarsrud, i'll do ^^
13:19  Cork: ?jquery.get

13:21  Yan_Nick: ?unbind
13:21  bot-t: .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
13:21  Arimil: JKarsrud: damn :( I thought I found it the selector didn't have quotes but adding them didn't fix it.
13:21  JKarsrud: shouldn't have quotes
13:23  Arimil: Hm...
13:23  JKarsrud: okay, so the begins with selector doesn't work
13:24  JKarsrud: Arimil: But this works
13:24  JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgYLv/4/

13:29  davidw: http://jsfiddle.net/eLvRb/ <- ignoring the missing closing tags, I thought that each new function was supposed to 'capture' the value of 'i' rather than a reference to it that changes each time
13:29  davidw: how can I accomplish what I want?
13:30  Cork: davidw: what?
13:31  philk__: I want to select the <tr> element of a table that has a specific "serialNumber" attribute and also any following <tr> that has no "serialNumber" attribute.
13:31  davidw: Cork, I want each one to get a function like foo(1), foo(2), foo(3), and so on
13:31  davidw: rather than all point to foo(6)
13:31  Cork: davidw: that should be what happens
13:33  thyphus: monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/eYgi4ke4 solved my problem from yesterday :)
13:33  davidw: Cork, ok, thanks... that's what I thought... it's not though, it's giving me '6'

13:35  Cork: davidw: http://jsfiddle.net/eLvRb/2/
13:36  philk__: uhmm Cork, the markup looks like this <tr data-serial-number="1234"/><tr /><tr data-serial-number="4321"/>. I want to remove the tr with data-serial-number=1234 and the next tr but not the one with 4321
13:36  Arimil: $(this).substr($(this).lastIndexOf("/")); is wrong isn't it :(
13:36  thyphus: monkeynut: i have to admit that the source is not of me at all... i've stolen it from http://www.mattryall.net/demo/filter/
13:36  davidw: Cork, ok, that's pretty obvious.... what I'm not getting is why the 'i' isn't being captured as part of the new function
13:36  thyphus: but i know how it works :)
13:36  Arimil: do I not use $ the secon time?
13:37  JKarsrud: Arimil: cache it: var $this= $(this); and that's better anyways
13:37  Cork: philk__: $('tr[data-serial-number=1234').nextUntil('rd[data-serial-number=4321]').add($('tr[data-serial-number=1234'))
13:38  Cork: (untested, but it should work)
13:38  monkeynut: thyphus, we all start by grabbing code from the web ;)
13:38  thyphus: i know :)
13:39  Arimil: lol, it appears javascript functions don't work in jquery so I need to look up the equivilent of lastindexof and substr
13:39  thyphus: monkeynut: but there's a further problem. in my list are about 6000 entrys. how do i speedup my script?
13:39  JKarsrud: Arimil, you could just do this.substr etc then
13:40  JKarsrud: Arimil, or check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3732641/jquery-substr-method-on-link-text
13:40  monkeynut: thyphus, you mean that for loop is actually 6000 iterations?
13:40  Hopsy: i got a vaccination today =[
13:40  philk__: thanks Cork, testing
13:40  thyphus: monkeynut: yes
13:40  monkeynut: thyphus, I very strongly recommend you use $.live instead
13:41  monkeynut: and for each of those #tux-blah, give them the same class
13:41  doonie: meep meep
13:41  thyphus: tux-blah?
13:42  monkeynut: then $('.a_tux').live('mouseover', function() { highlighttux(i); });

13:47  thyphus: monkeynut: no problem :) thanks alot
13:47  monkeynut: thyphus, there is a much faster way, using the :contains selector ;)
13:47  monkeynut: you don't have to $.each all the elements and regex them

14:05  monkeynut: no probs thyphus
14:05  thyphus: hm, is there sth like ":!contains"?

14:19  temp01: gls\Fr4NgUs: it's hard to understand you

14:24  temp01: if value == 1, you want "1 cpu"?
14:24  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: you'll need to create a lookup table
14:24  thyphus: monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/VGVySVB4 my actl. source. but i dont know how to show the hidden parts if i change clear the text. and it's also slow

14:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: : one cpu for examle
14:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: i d'ont want see 1
14:25  gls\Fr4NgUs: numeric value

14:26  Aquaguy: $('#amountRange').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
14:26  temp01: gls\Fr4NgUs: use a lookup table like monkeynut said. e.g. foo = {1: "one", 2: "two"...} then foo[ui.value] + ' cpu'
14:26 * temp01 bbl
14:27  thyphus: monkeynut: i can try it by myself and ask you in the afternoon or next week. it's not so important
14:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: can you write an example in my code ? http://www.jsfiddle.net/3BxXb/
14:27  monkeynut: $('#amountRange').attr('disabled', true); should suffice Aquaguy (if I've understood you right)
14:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: for example just for value one

14:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: if value 1 == one cpu
14:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: thx a lot
14:28  Aquaguy: [monkeynut] that gives me <input type="text" id="amountRange" disabled>
14:28  Aquaguy: not <input type="text" id="amountRange" disabled="disabled">

14:47  oodavid: luka8088: It's valid, but redundant - some browsers take the liberty of removing it

15:07  JSM87: This is sort of a css question but does involved jquery. I have 3 images in a div that are all set to display:none. I then use jquery fadeIn to fade each of them in 1 by one with a 2 second interval. The only problem is, because I use text-align center. when the first image is faded in it is in the center of the screen, then it is pushed left as the second is faded in.
15:07  JSM87: Basically I want it to be in invisible but still physically there.
15:07  JSM87: So things dont jump around as I fade each in 1 by 1
15:08  henrikkok: JSM87: you can use position: absolute to fix the "jumping around thing"
15:08  JSM87: henrikkok: ok let me try that now
15:08  AlexC_: JSM87: simple, use the CSS "visibility" property instead of "hidden"
15:09  AlexC_: er, instead of display, even
15:10  henrikkok: JSM87: you should not use my advice, i think i misunderstood. Mine is only for placing images on-top of each other
15:10  larsemil: nail_: var position = $("#content-wrapper").offset();
15:10  JSM87: AlexC_: visibility:hidden; that hides them fine but they dont fade in now
15:10  JSM87: Im sure I read fadeIn only works with display:none elements
15:11  AlexC_: JSM87: well then simple write your own CSS animation and use "opacity", it's very simple
15:11  AlexC_: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
15:11  JSM87: AlexC_: Ive done it before using this method, I just had to change something very simple. Id prefer to keep it that way instead of rewriting
15:12  AlexC_: JSM87: it's hardly rewriting - they will do the same thing and all you need to do is change 1 line

15:13 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
15:13  JSM87: AlexC_: I just took text align center off and used margin instead to place them dead center, all ok now. But I have another question
15:14  JSM87: Im using this code I wrote to fade in 3 images 1 by 1, 2 seconds apart. Is there a better way to write this? http://pastebin.com/CEb5b44w
15:15  monkeynut: JSM87: it's fine, better way would be less tabs ;)
15:15  JSM87: monkeynut: haha, ok
15:15  monkeynut: JSM87: if you prefer then you could have the first callback create timers to set off the other fade operations 2000,4000
15:15  Nomikos: I'd suggest trying to put it in a loop that runs through an array of image references somehow, waiting 2 seconds in between each loop
15:15  Nomikos: But atm I'm too stupid to come up with example source >.<
15:16  monkeynut: JSM87: depending on what makes them fade, you could even have all 3 go on timers
15:16  JSM87: monkeynut: Probably seems like just as much code to what I have
15:16  JSM87: I guess mine is sufficent enough
15:16  pashmi: I have stuck in fairly simple code... I can figure it out.... anyone has done growing from bottom to top with visibility set to hidden
15:17  monkeynut: JSM87: I would probably just leave it if it works, 3 timers is 3 clear lines though

15:24  loxs: what is the "right" way to make jQureyUI tabs   act like  overflow-x:stcroll
15:24  loxs: *scroll
15:25  monkeynut: loxs, for that kind of thing I usually just select the appropriate class and put in the css. I don't know off hand if there's an option to set default css for those tabs
15:25  pashmi: monkeynut sorry
15:25  monkeynut: that's ok pashmi, it doesn't help that english isn't your first language ;)
15:26  loxs: monkeynut, thanks, I was thinking of that, just didn't know if it's a good idea
15:26  monkeynut: if you can find an option in the docs, use that, otherwise the only problem would be if they change the class names in a later release, which is no biggy to solve ;)
15:29  loxs: monkeynut, I will get my tabs by ID, so it doesn't matter

15:36  anntoin: Hi, trying to find out if this is a bug or if am I doing something stupid. The load() function is working when there are no selectors i.e. .load('url'); works but .load('url #id'); doesn't. The code is here: http://pastebin.com/W3sTj4ja . I've tried multiple versions on the library (1.3, 1.4.2, 1.4.3, git) and nothing seems to work. Any ideas?
15:37  Nomikos: anntoin: since #main is unique (or should be) you could skip the Projects/projects ? Haven't seen that selector before btw
15:38  gls\Fr4NgUs: someone know symbole euro in javascript ?

15:39  Nomikos: anntoin: scratch that. try $('#main').load('url' etc
15:39  gls\Fr4NgUs: lol
15:39  Nomikos: anntoin: no, just forget anything I said >.<
15:42  anntoin: @Nomikos, No problem. Thanks for checking. It's getting the file okay but the selector isn't parsing out the new #main div (or any other selector I've tried). Could this be a bug?
15:43  anntoin: I'm quite new to jQuery (and AJAX) and don't want to file a bug report unless I'm sure there is a problem.
15:44  Nomikos: anntoin: sorry, I couldn't say. It's unlikely over so many versions though. Does the error console come up with anything?
15:44  anntoin: Nope. Everything seems to be fine - the file is received, just no content is shown.

15:46  vispillo: i suppose the stupid but obvious question is - does the file you're loading really have a #main element? :)

15:47  Neiluj: there's a cleaner & better way
15:47  anntoin: Yep. Checked that quite a few times :)
15:48  anntoin: The entire document is loaded into the #main div when I'm not using a selector and that document also has a #main div (they're generated from the same template)
15:48  Nomikos: Could it be jQuery has issues with double .. yeah, that
15:48  monkeynut: anntoin, that will be a problem. Ids must be unique
15:48  Nomikos: What I'm reading in the docs is you end up with a nested #main
15:49  Nomikos: But then you said other selectors didn't work either?
15:49  monkeynut: Nomikos, you probably end up with a confused DOM, there should only ever be one id of a given value
15:49  Nomikos: hm-mm
15:50  monkeynut: anntoin, try chaing the id of one of them to other_main, see if that fixes the problem
15:50  anntoin: No selectors were working but they would have had the same ids alright. I'll try with a new template. Thanks.

17:13  halogenandtoast: It seems like height() is returning 0 for an element which obviously has a height, why would this happen?
17:13  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: if the element has 0 height ;)
17:14  halogenandtoast: monkeynut: You shouldn't kick people when they are down.
17:14  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: when you say 'obviously' how sure are you that you're taking the height of the element that definiately has height?
17:14  monkeynut: have you looked in firebug?
17:14  monkeynut: got a live link?
17:14  ajpiano: theyranos: speed, will only return one element max

17:15  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: wasn't asking for dating sites! just to see the problem ;)
17:15  serio: I want somebody to explain something to me...
17:16  serio: using something like .closest("form")
17:16  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: if you use firebug, check that the div which has height is definitely the one being selected
17:16 --- [1]EDF is now known as EDF
17:16  serio: assuming the form has an id attribute, is it better to just look for it using that?
17:16  monkeynut: sometimes you can have a parent of zero height containing a div of non-zero height. I suspect this is what is happening and you are taking the size of that parent.
17:16  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: ^^
17:16  serio: basically, is chaining always the best approach.
17:17  halogenandtoast: Yeah I worked up the chain to the first non-zero element
17:17  monkeynut: serio: if it has an id that is always the fastes way to access it
17:17  halogenandtoast: but the first zero element doesn't make sense, so I guess I'll figure it out from there

17:17  serio: string.replace( '.', '?' );
17:18  halogenandtoast: monkeynut: I'm sure it's some weird css thing that won't be in the paste I come up with
17:18  serio: if that's the case, then why does something like closest even exists?
17:18  halogenandtoast: I'll play around with it a bit and let you know if I find something
17:19  Phrogz: mny: Better how? You could use an array and .join to avoid intermediary string generation (or do modern interpreters handle this well now?)
17:19  monkeynut: ok halogenandtoast, good luck. not much I can do without code or sample i'm afraid. but it should only return 0 if zero height, it will return undefined if it's not matching anything

17:22  dub54: http://pastebin.com/zskfd8be
17:23  dub54: oh, was using .val() on the end and not html()
17:23  RomD: you can use .children instead of .find
17:23  RomD: should be cheaper in some cases

17:27  bleen_work: ajpiano: danke!
17:35  halogenandtoast: monkeynut: The issue, I think is that there are multiple items with the same id and some of those are display:none
17:36  halogenandtoast: How this happened I'm not sure
17:36  ajpiano: lol
17:36  monkeynut: that may be confusing things, nothing to do with the display value, there should never be multiple of the same id.
17:36  halogenandtoast: Yes I know
17:37  halogenandtoast: I think it has something to do with tabs not being setup correctly
17:37  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: are you sure you're not supposed to be using classes rather than ids? I find it hard to believe the tabs ui is putting in bad html on its own
17:38  halogenandtoast: yes

17:44  Third3ye: Hey folks ^_^ Big fan of Jquery, gonna implament it in a lot of projects... but I've reached an impass. Trying to make a frontpage where there is more content than fits the window, for easier usability and readability using a content slider... however, I am having a bit of a problem with dimensions, paddings, heights, and overflow...
17:44  Third3ye: for reference check this out: http://dreamsindigital.org/test/
17:44  monkeynut: ah, halogenandtoast, thought that was going to be a live site :(

17:46  monkeynut: I guess it's out of the question to just point us at your domain halogenandtoast?
17:46  halogenandtoast: I'm working something out
17:46  monkeynut: Third3ye: i'll bite, but there doesn't seem to be a problem there for me
17:49  Third3ye: monkeynut: I added left and right borders to the slider div to illustrate that at the bottom fo the content there is a large spacing for some strange reason, maybe because of jquery's preset height
17:49  Third3ye: If you have a big screen shrink the window to get the desired, or rather, undesired effect
17:50  monkeynut: ok
17:51  Woelfle: hey guys. is there a way to make the draggable-event "stop" fire before the revert animation is done?
17:51  monkeynut: Third3ye:  I don't see a large spacing issue, seems to scale nicely for me, problem is though, nothing pops up for me to be able to scroll.
17:51  Third3ye: I could add more lorem ipsum :P

17:57  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: I can see the div with class ui-accordian-content always has height 0.  do you do anything to set that or is that entirely the widget's doing?
17:57  mr_mustard: in the parameters object I pass to jQuery.ajax, I'd like to access from the "success" callback the "data" member, to get a specific query parameter. It's bad that when I access this.data, it returns me something like 'id=123&other_var=something', so I feel like I have to use a query-string-to-object parser to get the "id" value; what's the best way to get the "id" value?
17:57  halogenandtoast: I havent' added anything to that class
17:57  halogenandtoast: I've added not styles for ui-* compoenents
17:57  halogenandtoast: s/not/no/
17:58  monkeynut: hmmm ... perhaps you have to add some options for it to work, have you checked your implementation against the examples in the doc? what differences are there?

18:01  monkeynut: halogenandtoast: if you take out autoheight, don't you need to then use callbacks to specify the height the content needs to expand to?
18:01  monkeynut: adamhutton: what a terribly evil thing to do!
18:02  monkeynut: adamhutton: I think only internal corporate sites should ever be allowed to do that
18:02  adamhutton: monkeynut: perhaps--but I can't get it to work :(
18:02  adamhutton: our use case is actually for a Terms and Conditions agreement--where the UX folk determined they MUST agree to proceed
18:03  adamhutton: and the dialog (modal) contains the <form>
18:03  monkeynut: well, you've made me feel dirty adamhutton, but stopPropagation should do the trick (or possibly return false from the callback).
18:03  adamhutton: monkeynut: :( I'm sorry--I don't think it's a great UX decision either
18:04  theyranos: adamhutton: you probably shouldn't be using javascript for that… every time i see one of those i use a firefox addon to disable scripts on that page and reload

18:05  adamhutton: monkeynut: http://jsbin.com/isuvi/2/edit - I thought I had the callback return false here?
18:05  monkeynut: adamhutton: would it not be acceptable to just use beforeClose to open a page that says "sorry, if you can't agree you can't use it"

18:06  adamhutton: albeit less communicative :(
18:06  monkeynut: well, just refreshing is less communicative
18:07  adamhutton: exactly
18:07  adamhutton: but, that's pretty much what they want me to build. for now. alpha version and all :P

19:17  compaq: what are some alert alternatives?
19:17  Phrogz: JammyJim: Don't ask to ask, just ask.
19:17  Phrogz: `ask @ JammyJim
19:17  JammyJim: ok can someone take a look at http://pastebin.com/SFPgmzBA
19:18  Phrogz: Damnit, why aren't all the bot triggers the same :p
19:18  Phrogz: JammyJim: Line 1, you're missing a type attribute on your script element.
19:19  Phrogz: JammyJim: Line 24 sort of obviates lines 26-34
19:19  compaq: I want an alert that will will auto click ok after 1 or 2 secs, and also, pass control of the script immediately, instead of waiting for input
19:19  Phrogz: JammyJim: You've shown code, but you still haven't asked a question. :)
19:19  JammyJim: lol
19:19  JammyJim: ok
19:19  JammyJim: well i have a table which fetches data from mysql using asp
19:19  Third3ye: container block)
19:20  JammyJim: (i know its old hat but habits die hard)
19:20  Third3ye: wtf..
19:20  Third3ye: http://dreamsindigital.org/test/ <-I want to add a scrollbar to each of the slides (that need it), but is that possible when setting the containing div to overflow:hidden; (so the content doesn't "pierce" the container block)
19:20  JammyJim: on last col i have a 'delete commment' button (its a table of comments grabbed by userid)
19:20  JammyJim: i want to be able to bring up a dialogue which says 'please confirm you want to delete'
19:20  JammyJim: im using jqueryui for the dialog stuff
19:21  JammyJim: what i want to be able to do is for the ahref to load the dialogue on a click and then if they hit 'ok' it window.location's to the href contained within the button
19:21  JammyJim: if that makes sense
19:21  JammyJim: so
19:21  JammyJim: <td><div class="respond"><a href="deletecomment.asp?id=<%=objrs2("id")%>&oid=<%=oid%>">Delete</a></div></td>
19:21  JammyJim: is the code from the column with delete in it
19:21  jexmex_: anybody ever had problems getting yetti tabs working when calling the active tab with rewrite....
19:22  JammyJim: so on clicking that it should load up the dialogue and then prompt to confirm the deletion before going to the deletecomment.asp page
19:22  JammyJim: but it needs to pass the row id to the deletecomment.asp page
19:22  jexmex_: for example i have domain,com/item/something that rewrites to domain.com/item.php?listing=3
19:22  jexmex_: it works fine without the rewrite, but with the rewrite it dont select the tab
19:22  JammyJim: any help greatly appreciated phrogz :)
19:23  compaq: append is kinda slow, is there a way to immediately send a message like Please Wait, besides alert, cause alert looks like an error message, also, people think it is obtrusive, and it waits for you to click ok, before passing control
19:23  theyranos: JammyJim: then shouldn't the <a> have <a class="respond"> ?  I base this solely on line 21
19:23  JammyJim: the div class is respond so it should trigger
19:23  serio: mmhmmm
19:24  bakers: If I want to disable a form element do I do .attr('disabled',true); or .attr('disabled','disabled')
19:24  JammyJim: are the brackets and everything in the right place etc? - i feel retarded for even asking that question
19:24  serio: bakers, preventDefault()
19:24  theyranos: JammyJim: test in firefox and the error console will tell you
19:24  compaq: bakers, I am not sure. But if you know what you would write int he html, then it would be that one
19:25  serio: I guess you can do it that way too.
19:25  bakers: is there a disabled selector? Show me all the disabled elements?
19:25  bakers: Cool looks like :disabled
19:25  bakers: I <3 jquery
19:25  compaq: JammyJim, I use div or span and then in the script I have $('.class-name').click(function() { whatever I wanna do on click}
19:25  serio: there are a lot of useful psuedo selectors
19:26  theyranos: is $(x, y) equivalent to $(x).find(y) or the other way around?
19:26  serio: so, just to clarify, with forms you can do it one of two ways...
19:26  __tosh: ?json2
19:26  bot-t: Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - http://json.org/json2.js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)
19:26  compaq: Anyone notice append is slow
19:26  serio: disable the entire submit event
19:26  serio: or, just disable the submit button itself.
19:27  serio: but then, somebody could basically go into console and be like
19:27  serio: form.submit()
19:31  JammyJim: i get a 'missing } after property list' on  buttons:{
19:31  JammyJim: which ive just put in but doesnt seem to change what error console says :(

19:42  compaq: sean`, I don't mind the wait for the append for loop I have,  thing is, I put another append before it put the message "one moment please", but even that message shows up when the for loop appends do.  I want to send a message immediately, so it doesn't seem unresponsive to a new user
19:42  sean`: ?details
19:42  bot-t: Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
19:42  JammyJim: compaq/phrogs - can either of you take a look at http://pastebin.com/hJ7E5pA5
19:42  compaq: sean`, alert would be good, if I could use the a different styling so that it doesn't look so obtrusive
19:43  JammyJim: it wont pass the variable "url" to the dialog box button for some reason and i dont know why :(
19:43  compaq: sean`, basically, when append runs, there is a 30sec pause.  I want to send a message immediately and then have the 30 sec pause
19:43  sean`: compaq, an alert is the devil picking your soul piece by piece
19:44  compaq: http://jsfiddle.net/wvFbk/
19:45  compaq: sean`, yeah, I know alert isn't a good idea, people think something is wrong, or find it obtrusive
19:45  sean`: compaq, read the article temp01 showed you
19:45  sean`: I don't get what the problem is
19:45  compaq: sean`, I did, but I didn't find alternative
19:46  sean`: \http://jsfiddle.net/wvFbk/1/
19:46  compaq: sean`, I am satisfied with the delay.  There is no problem.  I am just trying to find another method to send a message dynamically, that will be quick, before the slow append
19:46  sean`: this way you show the message in the container
19:46  sean`: and after you finished your loop, you append it in one batch
19:46  sean`: and remove the message
19:46  sean`: DONE
19:46  sean`: OR
19:46  sean`: you could place an overlay on top of yuour container and show a loading gif
19:47  vmasto: hello, quick question: how can I select a div and specify that I want it selected only if it hasn't got a specific parent?

19:47  gls\Fr4NgUs: i need help
19:48  compaq: sean`, it already appends in one batch.  That is what I wanted to avoid
19:48  gls\Fr4NgUs: http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/21/ i Want * input value duree * prix
19:49  gls\Fr4NgUs: for example if value input = 1 prix 23 * 1
19:49  compaq: sean`, I don't mind waiting for the for loop append, but the one before it, that I added, doesn't show up immediately, it shows up together with the for loop appends

19:54  selckin: JammyJim: ask a question.
19:54  gls\Fr4NgUs: ?
19:54  JammyJim: how do i get it to pass the url
19:54  ajpiano: vmasto http://jsbin.com/axiho5/7
19:54  JammyJim: to the dialog button
19:54  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin
19:54  ajpiano: vmasto: don't put the period IN the class attribute
19:54  vmasto: yeah sorry my fault
19:54  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin : i don't want do this i want input value * input text_prix
19:55  JammyJim: the href value
19:55  vmasto: oh nice ajpiano !
19:55  vmasto: thank alot, which one would you recommendt efficient-wise?
19:55  vmasto: thanks*
19:55  selckin: gls\Fr4NgUs: then ask questions i can understand with smaller test case
19:56  ajpiano: JammyJim, you don't need to "pass" anything, please explain how the current code isn't adequate
19:56  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin : I would like the value input_duree be multiplied by the value of text_prix
19:56  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin : you don't uderstant this ?
19:56  selckin: seems to stupid of a question that i think i don't
19:56  JammyJim: well the dialog appears and the two buttons are there - delete / cancel
19:56  JammyJim: i hit delete and the page doesnt move
19:57  ajpiano: and why do you assume that means the "url" isn't available ?
19:57  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin : lol
19:57  JammyJim: instead of the delete function reading "window.location.href = url;" ive tried using "window.location.href = 'test.html'; and it works
19:57  ajpiano: can you console.log(url)
19:58  jexmex_: anybody ever had problems getting yetti tabs working when calling the active tab with rewrite....
19:58  JammyJim: this might sound stupid ajpiano but er
19:58  JammyJim: how

19:59  JammyJim: syntax error on window.location.href
20:00  gls\Fr4NgUs: selckin : i can't explain better
