00:00  pifantastic: asfahaan: here is what you have now: https://gist.github.com/cd1807c316608d443fd8
00:00  pifantastic: asfahaan: Im going to make a change
00:01  asfahaan: Thank you so so much pifantastic

00:02  Gidgidonihah: any way to add a class to a specific (say delete) button in the jqueryUI dialog so it can be styled differently?
00:02  patrickgamer: pifantastic: thanks, looking now
00:02  pifantastic: Gidgidonihah: why dont you just override the jQueryUI style with your own?
00:03  jedmund: guys, how can i target something adjacent to this' parent
00:03  Gidgidonihah: pifantastic: becuase all buttons would still be the same
00:03  pifantastic: oh I see
00:03  Gidgidonihah: pifantastic: I'm looking for a delete button being red and the cancel button looking default
00:03  pifantastic: Can you target that button specifically with CSS selectors?
00:03  jedmund: <div> <input> <ul><li this /></ul> </div>
00:03  jedmund: trying to get from li this to input
00:03  pifantastic: does it have a container element with an ID?
00:04  pifantastic: jedmund: $(this).closest("input");
00:04  Gidgidonihah: no, the markup is identical across buttons
00:05  jedmund: sweet pifantastic
00:06  pifantastic: Gidgidonihah: you can possible put something in the open event of the dialog
00:06  pifantastic: Gidgidonihah: $(
00:06  pifantastic: $("whatever").dialog({ open: function(e, ui) { $(this).find("button-selector"); });
00:07  subsume: What's a good way to prepare a string to be printed as HTML?
00:07  subsume: I thought slashing the quotes would be a good thing?
00:07  Gidgidonihah: pifantastic: still wouldn't work because the markup is identical. The only thing that's different is the text inside the <button>
00:08  Gidgidonihah: and trying to find it off that is icky
00:08  patrickgamer: pifantastic: I don't see the change between your link and my code
00:08  patrickgamer: pifantastic: did you update before you linked me?
00:08  pifantastic: Gidgidonihah: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
00:08  Gidgidonihah: oh, right.
00:08  Gidgidonihah: that
00:08  Gidgidonihah: :)
00:08  Gidgidonihah: still
00:09  pifantastic: patrickgamer: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/kcXqq/1/
00:09  pifantastic: Gidgidonihah: it's the only way brah

00:12  TheEmpath: how can i see how many users are connected to a socket server with socket.io?
00:12  TheEmpath: oops wrong chan
00:12  katspaugh: Hi! I've updated jQuery to the latest version and the keyboard events started to work differently. The focus in a text input element prevents the key-press event handler bound to the document element.
00:12  pifantastic: $("server").usersConnected();
00:13  ProLoser: does anyone here use lazyloader?
00:13  delinquentme: is there a CSS command i can use to flip or rotate a background 180 degrees??
00:14  jedmund: pifantastic: this isn't working :(
00:14  katspaugh: What I meant was, if you type anything inside an input, the document's key-press isn't handled.
00:14  jedmund: pifantastic:  $(this).closest('input.fsinput').val($(this).text());

00:15  bot-t: katspaugh, Couldn't find "irrelevant @ Vorspire, but thanks." in jQuery Docs.
00:15  jedmund: okay
00:16  unruthless: delinquentme, not that I'm aware of. you can do that in JS though
00:17  jedmund: pifantastic: still nothing. example: http://dev.getfoundation.com/ui/finput.php the red box should update
00:18  Vorspire: (katspaugh): they way you explained your problem suggests that you also wish that the document.event key-press should be called, thus trigger() therefor :. not irrelivant, but no problem.
00:18  katspaugh: In the previous version of jQuery and even in pre-release version, the keyboard events bubbled up all right, you see.
00:18  jedmund: apparently its not selecting right
00:19  katspaugh: Vorspire: It should be called by itself, for the document element contains the input.
00:19  ElGoorf: ince xp
00:19  Vorspire: (katspaugh): are there any parent elements with the keypress event handlers that have e.stopPropogation() called?
00:19  pifantastic: jedmund: which red box should update when I do what
00:20  jedmund: pifantastic: click on the red box  next to the "Select a Foundation" box
00:20  jedmund: pifantastic: and the "Select a Foundation" box will update. Its essentially <select>
00:20  katspaugh: Vorspire: In any handlers or only in keyboard event handlers?
00:20  jedmund: pifantastic: i got it though, it needed .prev().prev();
00:20  jedmund: is there a way to condense that or is that just that?
00:21  patrickgamer: pifantastic: eval! I should have known! thanks dude - funny thing is that i'm using eval elsewhere in my solution... Guess I got blinded by my own problems
00:21  Vorspire: (katspaugh): keyboard events
00:22  pifantastic: jedmund: try: $(this).closest("div.fsselect").find("input.fsinput")
00:22  asfahaan: pifantastic: iam rubbing my eyes... its working! :) Thanks. Also thanks eTiger13
00:22  katspaugh: Vorspire: No, I don't think so. There's a very much alike element near by the input element, which doesn't prevent the key event.
00:22  jedmund: pifantastic: will do
00:22  pifantastic: jedmund: $(this).parent().siblings("input.fsinput") should also work
00:22  Vorspire: this might help, see: ?plugin/onChanged @ katspaugh

01:40  erichynds: eTiger13, you mean positioned off screen?

01:42  chovy_: is it last-child ?
01:42  erichynds: isn't that what you wanted?
01:42  katspaugh: Vorspire: I ended up calling the handle manually, from the input event. Even jQuery's "trigger" for the document didn't work for some reason.
01:42  chovy_: erichynds: so if there are 5 items, and only 3 are visible, i want #3
01:43  danheberden: :visible:last
01:43  erichynds: :visible:last should work
01:43  chovy_: in other words, i don't want the 4,5 because those are outside the visible viewport in the container.
01:43  erichynds: oh, i see
01:44  chovy_: 4+5 don't have the "display: none;" which i think is what your code is for.

02:03  katspaugh: Vorspire, which one?
02:03  chovy_: styol: footer?
02:03  Vorspire: the one you just linked
02:04  katspaugh: Vorspire, what bugs are there in it, precisely?
02:04  styol: chovy_: all in the header, havent quite determined how to output the scripts in the footer yet, but jquery is indeed loaded prior to the jquery mobile javascript that throws the error
02:04  chovy_: styol: is this in ie by chance?
02:04  styol: chovy_: unfortunately no, testing in firefox with firebug.. http://vishun.com/drupal7b
02:05  Vorspire: katspaugh, well, the html contains the script and the script is also in the script window :P
02:05  chovy_: $html ?
02:05  chovy_: haven't seen that one.
02:05  styol: its a drupal install which does not come with jquery 1.4.2, but utilizing a module called jquery_update which brings it to 1.4.2 but its drupal and im trying to make a jquery mobile theme to release and so far its not having it.. that is also why i havent figured out how to output scripts in the header because im using a newer version of drupal that im not used to yet
02:05  styol: ^ chovy_
02:06  styol: *scripts in the footer
02:06  chovy_: styol: gotcha
02:06  chovy_: are you sure you want $html = $('html'); ?
02:06  styol: this is in the jquery mobile javascript, im not sure no hehe
02:06  chovy_: oh
02:06  styol: i dont quite understand it either
02:09  eTiger13: styol:  why cant you use 1.4.3?
02:09  chovy_: out of his control  i think
02:09  styol: yah
02:09  katspaugh: Vorspire, OK, thanks anyway. Bye!
02:09  chovy_: styol: i just moved it to the footer, and still got the error. so rule that out.
02:09  styol: i suppose it breaks drupal, perhaps some day may be able to but presently not able to
02:10  styol: jquery_update updates the version of jquery that comes stock with drupal (not sure which version) but it updates it to 1.4.2 specifically
02:11  chovy_: you could not use the plugin and just add jquery.js files to your template.
02:11  styol: for sure but i would imagine that would already be the case if it didnt make some things break
02:11  styol: i did try it on d6 though and it kinda worked, mostly did not.. will try same concept on d7
02:12  styol: (cause for instance on d6 it only goes up to 1.3.2 with jquery_update)
02:13  chovy_: i had that problem with jrails once.

02:25  seancurtis: anyone know of any tools that allow you to diff the DOM of a page before and after a change? Eg. dump the computed styles of all nodes on a page, change the css/JS and again dump the computed styles and then compare the pre/post changes?

02:32  joshualewis: Hi, inside of the callback in a jQuery.get() request I'm replacing a the contents of a paragraph tag using .text(newText). It functions fine except that in IE6 through 8 in IETester and IE8 on windows 7  the text's appearance changes becoming bold and jagged. Has anyone seen this before, or can point me to something that will explain what is going on.
02:33  seancurtis: joshualewis: do you have bold text and opacity?
02:33  joshualewis: The site it's on is http://cv.lewiswebdesign.com/ and my script can be seen at http://pastie.org/1236958 (relevant call at line 162)
02:33  seancurtis: joshualewis: there are known bugs surrounding fadein and opacity with bold text in IE
02:33  joshualewis: I'm using fadeto()
02:34  seancurtis: yeah - don't use fade with bold text in IE :)
02:34  seancurtis: I think it's the proprietary IE filters that are stuffing up
02:34  chovy_: is there bg color on your bolded element?
02:34  joshualewis: Bold shouldn't be set anywhere on that paragraph but I'll look for something other thatn fadein to use.
02:34  joshualewis: Thanks for the quick responses.
02:35  seancurtis: joshualewis: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/778208/jquery-fadein-leaves-text-not-anti-aliased-in-ie7
02:35  seancurtis: joshualewis: http://blog.bmn.name/2008/03/jquery-fadeinfadeout-ie-cleartype-glitch/
02:35  seancurtis: could be cleartype
02:35  chovy_: sounds like it
02:35  seancurtis: I've noticed it with bold text previously - from those it looks to happen on other things now too
02:35  chovy_: i disabled fadeIn for ie.
02:36 --- b0xa is now known as b0x
02:36  seancurtis: yeah I did the same chovy
02:37  seancurtis: other browsers fade, in IE it just appears
02:37  joshualewis: We'll I'm not too happy with the fadeOut(), fadeIn() effect anyway so I'll try some other animations.
02:37  seancurtis: joshualewis: you can overlay the container with a block of solid colour and then fade that out
02:37  seancurtis: sort of like revealing stuff underneath
02:38  seancurtis: would mean you have to append stuff and size it correctly but still might work ok
02:38  arex\: I have an element that I want to wrap around another element in the document. How?
02:38  chovy_: i believe i had mine working in ie8

02:43  Vito_: hello
02:44  arex\: Help me brainstorm a little. Is it possible to emphasise an element on page without changing the element's attributes?
02:44  Vito_: can i do a slideDown and specify the size to expand to?
02:44 --- Vito_ is now known as Guest84770

02:44 --- Guest84770 is now known as Vito_Help
02:44  Vito_Help: there we go
02:44  chovy_: arex\: how would you do that?
02:44  arex\: I was thinking of wrapping the element in a another element with styles, but inline vs block makes it problematic
02:44  chovy_: <foo /> is still <foo /> unless you change it's properties.
02:45  chovy_: arex\: can you add a class?
02:45  arex\: chovy_: no
02:45  chovy_: what are you emphasizing?
02:46  arex\: i want to add a border or something, something so the user sees it clearly
02:46  arex\: but i can't change the elements attributes
02:46  chovy_: what's the distinction?
02:46  chovy_: i mean behaviour wise
02:46  chovy_: <foo /> (emphasized) vs. <foo /> (plain)
02:47  arex\: chovy_: i wanna emphasise something on click, but without changing the clicked element's attributes
02:47  chovy_: oh
02:47  chovy_: $('foo').click(function(e){ $(e.target).css('background', 'blue'); }
02:48  arex\: doesn't that change the element's style attribute?
02:48  arex\: yes it does
02:49  Vorspire: why don't you just wrap the element with a <style>? of course if the element has a distinct id already set
02:49  chovy_: arex\: why can't you change it?
02:50  arex\: Vorspire: i'm having problems with that when the clicked element is an inline element vs block element
02:50  arex\: chovy_: long story
02:50  Vorspire: can you put an example/demo up on http://jsfiddle.net? :)
02:50  arex\: Vorspire: sure
02:51  chovy_: <div id="wrapper">......<foo /></div>      <div id="wrapper2">.....<foo /></div>  #wrapper foo { background: blue; } #wrapper2 foo { background: red; }
02:51  chovy_: i don't understand why you can't apply css to the item.
02:52  Vorspire: (arex\): another idea: use .clone on the element and float it above the original element, or behind, giving it a more pronounced border with CSS?
02:53  Vorspire: that way, you're styling the clone
02:53  chovy_: if you really can't touch <foo /> then i would style it's parent.
02:54  Vorspire: you can hook events from the clone, (if in-front) and pass them back to the original element for parsing, etc
02:54  seancurtis: arex\: $('<div id="wrapper" style="font-weight: bold;" />').wrap('#foo');
02:55  seancurtis: or add a css class to your css file and add that to the parent?
02:55  arex\: actually I can't touch attributes of any existing elements :P
02:56  arex\: i'm working on a jsfiddle with wrap now
02:56  arex\: also considering clone tactic if this doesnt work
02:56  Vorspire: good luck
02:56  Vorspire: pass the fiddle when you find it to be a satisfactory beta example :)
02:57  jaypur: does anyone know the name of the plugin used on this page: http://jquery.org/team at marking people's faces???
02:57  seancurtis: arex\: maybe explain why you can't touch attributes?
02:58  seancurtis: arex\: maybe we can find a workaround for that instead
02:58  seancurtis: may make things simpler?
02:58  chovy_: heh
02:58  chovy_: he wants to mutate an unmatable object.
02:59  chovy_: "i can't" doesn't help us.
03:00  hyperstream: Is it possible to use the .live( to run .resizeable() on an element that is being added by ajax?
03:00  Vorspire: unmatable xD epic typo
03:00  chovy_: :)
03:01  chovy_: immutable's should be able to at least mate. :)
03:01  arex\: Vorspire: grabbing css('display') from the parent seems to do the trick
03:01  arex\: http://jsfiddle.net/arex1337/YT8TY/
03:02  Vorspire: to more I click, the bigger the red thingy goes ;)
03:02  arex\: hehe ofc, just a short test :D
03:03  arex\: you DON'T wanna see my app :P
03:03  Vorspire: hehe
03:03  arex\: oh what the hell, do you?
03:03  Vorspire: sure ^^
03:04  Vorspire: you show me yours and ill show you mine
03:04  Vorspire: xD
03:04  seancurtis: hyperstream: you want to bind resize using .live()?
03:05  arex\: Vorspire: That's hot. This is not: http://jsfiddle.net/arex1337/atsSW/
03:07  seancurtis: arex\: can you explain in plain english what you are trying to do?
03:07  seancurtis: I'm confused - you want to wrap something on click but not modify the markup of the thing you're clicking in any way?
03:07  arex\: seancurtis: In regards to my current problem or my app?
03:08  seancurtis: the border thing
03:08  arex\: seancurtis: your description is correct
03:08  arex\: seancurtis: i think i got it though
03:08  seancurtis: arex\: your markup gets screwed when you do that - you have ul > div > li
03:08  seancurtis: and the more you click the more divs you get
03:08  seancurtis: ul > div > div > div > li = ugly as fuck
03:08  arex\: oh, right
03:08  arex\: crap
03:08  seancurtis: why can't you just add a class to the li?
03:09  seancurtis: explain to us why you can't modify the markup :)
03:09  arex\: maybe i can clone and position and z-index the clone
03:09  arex\: ?
03:09  seancurtis: answer  my question!!!! please
03:09  seancurtis: :)
03:09  Vorspire: (arex\): nothing seems to work for me :(
03:09  Vorspire: google chrome
03:10  arex\: Vorspire: true.
03:10  jaypur: does anyone know the name of the plugin used on this page: http://jquery.org/team at marking people's faces???
03:10  Vorspire: no, but you could write it yourself :P
03:10  seancurtis: arex\: why can't you modify the markup?
03:10  b0x: its jsut an image map?
03:10  b0x: with tooltips
03:11  jaypur: Vorspire, if i had some free time yes hahaha
03:11  jaypur: b0x, are you talking to me?
03:12  b0x: yeah
03:12 * Hierofant is on his fourth Quicktime detection script :(((
03:12  b0x: as per the site itself, its got jquery.photos.js
03:12  b0x: but doubt thats an official plugin :p
03:12  Vorspire: (jaypur): well, you first asked that question over 20mins ago so what have you been doing since then? :P
03:12  seancurtis: it looks hand coded - the hover stuff is just css with absolute positioning
03:12  arex\: seancurtis: well, the user clicks item in a fake browser (iframe). i don't want to change the element in any way. it should work and look as the website intented.
03:12  seancurtis: there's a little JS for fading
03:12  b0x: yeah
03:12  arex\: seancurtis: i could explain it better but it would take me an hour
03:13  jaypur: Vorspire, brushing my teeth
03:13  arex\: seancurtis: but i realize wrapping is crap. i'l try cloning

03:15 * Vorspire gives arex\ with a fresh Red Bull __Airwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiings!
03:16  arex\: lol
03:16  Vorspire: that is a seriously bad translation haha
03:18  seancurtis: arex\: in that case I'd write some kind of overlay manager - something that positions a div over the top of whatever you click on the layer
03:18  Hierofant: Does anyone know the right way to use navigator.plugins?
03:18  seancurtis: then you can manage the "overlay" instead of interfering with the underlying objects
03:19  arex\: seancurtis: i think i want the new element behind. the original element should work in all possible ways
03:20  seancurtis: arex\: well you can do that if you want - just give the overlay thing a border
03:20  seancurtis: or write 4 divs as a box so you don't block clicks
03:20  seancurtis: you trying to provide a firebug-style highlight of elements?
03:20  seancurtis: in Firebug when you click the "select" tool it blocks the first click when you select
03:20  seancurtis: you could do the same thing?
03:21  arex\: no the element must work normally
03:22  Hierofant: stackoverflow isn't always correct :/
03:25  maxfreeze: Hi! Got css background for tr:even and tr:odd set, but later when i try to highlight them the tr:odd doesn't let me highlight it!
03:29  maxfreeze: nvm
03:30  arex\: Why does this change the appearance of the element? http://jsfiddle.net/arex1337/YT8TY/3/
03:30  Hierofant: How can I loops through an object array looking for a word, and if the word exists, change a variable?
03:30  Hierofant: *loop
03:31  OhaiBBQ: arex\: it doesnt, it's because you're adding an li item that overlaps the first
03:31  seancurtis: arex\: you're overlapping elements and the text antialiasing overlaps
03:32  OhaiBBQ: ;D
03:32  arex\: damn anti aliasing
03:32  arex\: :D
03:32  seancurtis: so if a pixel is 40% transparent and you overlay it with another 40% transparent pixel you'll get something like 60% or 80% (not sure how it handles overlapping transparency)
03:33  seancurtis: arex\: you could visible: hidden the original
03:33  seancurtis: then fuck with the clone
03:33  seancurtis: clones deserve it
03:33  seancurtis: fake little bitches
03:33  arex\: but i need original click handlers on the clicked element to work
03:33  arex\: but maybe i can remove the inner html, i just need the border anyway
03:34  arex\: then i need to control the dimension
03:34  seancurtis: arex\: draw 4 divs and make them into the 4 sides of a square and 1px thick to form the box
03:34  seancurtis: that'll allow events to go through them
03:35  seancurtis: do transparent block elements allow click events to pass through to underlying elements?
03:35  arex\: seancurtis: wouldnt that shift the layout of the page with a couple of pixels in each direction :D
03:36 --- execute is now known as shesek
03:36  seancurtis: not if you overlay it?
03:36  seancurtis: absolutely position the "box"
03:37  seancurtis: then clicking another element you could "shift" the box to the new element using an animate
03:37  seancurtis: could look really hawt
03:37  arex\: hehe
03:37  seancurtis: instead of just removing the original and then drawing a new one
03:39  seancurtis: I saw a plugin a while back that was sort of an inverted overlay
03:39  seancurtis: it'd overlay a 50% black layer but leave a box for the focused bit
03:40  arex\: check this out
03:40  arex\:     $(this).clone().
03:40  arex\:         css('border', '1px solid red').
03:40  arex\:         css('z-index', '-999').

03:48  seancurtis: arex\: I'd do something similar to the last one

04:36  wunz: eponym: i don't see anything with any animation
04:37  eponym: wunz: there should be a glow around the icons.
04:37  wunz: ah, very small glow, had to notice on my high res here
04:38  wunz: so its glowing too fast, is that what you're saying?
04:38  eponym: I'm accomplishing the effect with a transparent png on top of an animated background. Every time you click a link, the animation goes faster. I don't want that to happen.
04:39  wunz: ah i see what you mean
04:39  wunz: set your pan speed with a low fps
04:40 --- MrSamuel_ is now known as MrSamuel
04:40  coldhead: lol faps
04:41  eponym: wunz: but why is the speed increasing?
04:41  wunz: what is your no_of_frames ?
04:41  wunz: and speed set to?
04:42  eponym: I'm just using $('li.active .iconframe').pan({fps: 20, speed: 3, dir: 'left'});
04:42  wunz: try setting fps to 12, speed 2, and no of frames 1
04:44  eponym: I'm not using the sprite method, though, I'm just using pan?
04:44  wunz: then dont insert in the no_of_frames attribute, fps is still pretty high, try like fps: 8, speed:0.5
04:46  eponym: That doesn't change the fact that the more I click, the faster it goes.
04:46  danheberden: twss?
04:47  eponym: Indeed.
04:54  wunz: hrmmm
04:55  wunz: eponym: add attribute depth
04:56  wunz: so like, depth: 2 << makes it move a constant speed
04:58  seancurtis: Reiterating my question from earlier. Anyone know of a tool to provide diffs of the DOM? Trying to automate the task of finding regressions due to CSS specificity/JS behaviour.
04:58  Pimpachu: Hey guys
04:58  seancurtis: ie. Load up a page, take a snapshot of the computed css values, apply patch/commit/css changes, take another snapshot and compare with the original
04:58  Pimpachu: Is it possible to do a replace('string', ''); so I can remove some text to expand my document?
04:59  wunz: yes
04:59  eponym: wunz: doesn't work. just clicking around a bunch gets it going stupidly fast again. the problem isn't parameters.
05:00  anchovy: seancurtis, diff?
05:00  seancurtis: anchovy: I want to see the differences in the computed styles for the same DOM before and after modifying some CSS
05:00  seancurtis: same markup, different CSS
05:01  anchovy: sounds like a custom job to me
05:01  wunz: epnonym: any way to reset the speed onclick?
05:02  wunz: so that you can do blah.spSpeed(2);
05:02  wunz: and puts it back to that speed
05:02  eponym: wunz: well that's what I'm trying to figure out
05:02  wunz: try it...
05:02  wunz: bind the click event and use the method .spSpeed(#)
05:02  wunz: i think its spspeed
05:03  wunz: i gotta get back sto studying now, exam tmrw, good luc eponym
05:04  eponym: thanks
05:04  eponym: That didn't help either. :(

05:32  angryonion: hi
05:33  angryonion: how do I set the width of an element by .css?
05:37  oficina7: is there a way to add events to the function "live".. such as $("#cool").live("mouseover,mouseout", function(){$(this).toggle()})
05:37  oficina7: ?
05:38  danheberden: oficina7: more like function handleThisShit() { /* stuff here */}  $('.selector'').live('mouseover', handleThisShit).live('mouseout', handleThisShit);
05:39  SpaceGhostC2C: Hey, I've got a project and I'm trying to use json. I've got a simple file written, but I don't know exactly how to use it. I've been looking online for an explaination that doesn't use twitter or flickr for the example, because that confuses things. Can I get some help with understanding it?
05:39  danheberden: and don't forget about mouseenter/mouseleave :)
05:39  SpaceGhostC2C: It's for loading in pictures into a gallery.
05:39  danheberden: SpaceGhostC2C: so you got a file with just json in it?
05:39  SpaceGhostC2C: danheberden: correct.
05:40  danheberden: we can't help you with an example there since it's local (i assume) but have you checked out jsfiddle? it has a 'testing ajax requests' portion for what you're trying to do
05:40  danheberden: basically it has some json feeds available to get your stuff working
05:41  SpaceGhostC2C: danheberden: I'm just wondering how to properly fetch the file if it's local.
05:41  danheberden: the same way..
05:41  SpaceGhostC2C: danheberden: I don't know any way at all.

05:55 * seancurtis hides from snover

05:55 @snover: They won’t take any more kindly to your w3schools links

05:55  dibs: I am going to be loading some <object> tags dynamically to a page and need to detect when they have finished loading, any ideas how I could do this??
05:55  vladikoff: did someone say w3schools?
05:55  nimbupani: seancurtis: what shameful links you put!
05:55  SlexAxton: seancurtis: you can ask another question when you've posted one link from http://promotejs.com somewhere on the internet
05:56  flintf: the w3 is for wrong wrong and werewolves will eat you if you use this site
05:56  seancurtis: lol @ all the w3schools hate
05:56  nimbupani: just what SlexAxton sez
05:56  seancurtis: Imma make me a shirt
05:56  nimbupani: w3schools is EVIL
05:56  l4rk: seancurtis: maybe once they update their shit past version 1
05:56  SlexAxton: seancurtis: go to http://promotejs.com
05:56  l4rk: of jquery
05:56  nimbupani: they fleece the innocent and the ignorant.
05:56  SpaceGhostC2C: Durka hm.
05:56  SlexAxton: copy the source they give you
05:56  SlexAxton: put it in your blog
05:56  seancurtis: shirt will say I <3 w3schools
05:57  SpaceGhostC2C: Wow, troll bait much?
05:57  nimbupani: seancurtis: you would not dare.
05:57  seancurtis: nimbupani: I reckon once I make them up I can then approach w3schools and get them to sell them on their site - might even be able to whack a nice Flash/Silverlight banner on their site promoting them!
05:57  seancurtis: I'll make squillions!
05:58  nimbupani: no way seancurtis they will sue you
05:58  dabaR1: Any idea why "jQuery('.entry br:first-child').addClass('first-image-spacing');"does not work on http://www.jaquilynshumate.com/wp/blog/ and works on http://www.jaquilynshumate.com/wp/blog/page/2/ ?
05:58  nimbupani: they are that kinds.
05:59  seancurtis: dabaR1: oh please please please don't use JS for doing that
05:59  dabaR1: seancurtis: what do you suggest?
05:59  seancurtis: just use css
05:59  dabaR1: css3? or css21?
05:59  seancurtis: just use css1 ffs
06:00  seancurtis: you have content in a paragraph
06:00  dabaR1: right
06:00  seancurtis: just end the </p>
06:00  dabaR1: Oh don't be a fool
06:00  seancurtis: and it'll space between that and the images
06:00  dabaR1: I have a shitload of posts
06:00  seancurtis: ...
06:00  dabaR1: Now I'm gonna go manually edit each one of them, or some shit
06:00  seancurtis: well bad content is bad content ...
06:00  SpaceGhostC2C: dabaR1: are your paragraphs closed correctly?
06:00  dabaR1: In any case, do you have an idea?
06:00  seancurtis: if you REALLY want to do it you could use css3 attribute selectors
06:01  seancurtis: but that won't work across the board
06:01  SpaceGhostC2C: Or, he could use js.
06:01  dabaR1: no, I don't, but thanks for the idea
06:01  seancurtis: you have <p>some text<br /><img> ....
06:01  dabaR1: SpaceGhostC2C: one sec.
06:02  dabaR1: Hm, not valid HTML, weirdly enough
06:02  seancurtis: dabaR1: the reason it's working on one page and not the other is that you don't have a <br> in the same place in the one where it's not working
06:03  SpaceGhostC2C: dabaR1: I'd fix that first.
06:03  dabaR1: SpaceGhostC2C: Is that the kind of thing that would cause this? (stupid question, since you went right for it)
06:03  seancurtis: dabaR1: on the page that doesn't work you have <div class="entry"><p>text text <a><img>
06:03  SpaceGhostC2C: dabaR1: let me look at the second page.
06:03  seancurtis: on the one that IS working you have <div class="entry"><p>text text <br><a><img>
06:04  seancurtis: you don't really have to go cleanup all the pages - can't you just go over the recent 20 or so and clean them up
06:04  seancurtis: you can do a certain amount with JS but if your markup isn't consistent it's hard to fix that ...
06:05  seancurtis: sorry if I came off a bit agressive - just hate seeing people using JS to do stuff which should be done with CSS :)
06:07  dabaR1: No worries, I just hope I can fix this.
06:07  dabaR1: Sometimes a hack is good.
06:07  dabaR1: In my opinion
06:07  seancurtis: yeah sometimes it is
06:07  dabaR1: I still have to make some money, and spend some time with my fam. :-)
06:07  seancurtis: but you could fix each page in about 5 minutes
06:08  seancurtis: just go into the html view of each post content and fix your paragraphs
06:08  seancurtis: natural spacing = nicer than using JS
06:09  dabaR1: OK, thanks for the opinion
06:09  SpaceGhostC2C: dabaR1: I'm not sure why your snippet is working on one and not the other.
06:09  seancurtis: plus if you cleaned up the code you could wrap those groups of images in something like a div with a meaningful class which would then allow you to target them for image gallery js plugins in the future
06:09  seancurtis: SpaceGhostC2C: I already explained why above
06:09  seancurtis: BR on one page, not on the other
06:09  SpaceGhostC2C: seancurtis: That's cool.
06:10  SpaceGhostC2C: I'm still trying to get a handle on json. :(
06:11  paul_irish: oh guys
06:11  dabaR1: SpaceGhostC2C: why are you not sure?
06:11  dabaR1: It works in my browser.
06:11  dabaR1: And I probably tested in a bunch of others.

06:13  paul_irish: figured i would get that page started
06:13  seancurtis: paul_irish: supposed to be a // in there?
06:14  vladikoff_: seancurtis, yeah
06:14  dabaR1: clearly
06:14  paul_irish:  // for great justice
06:14  seancurtis: haha
06:14  vladikoff_: it's to balance out the http://
06:14  seancurtis: ah - nice!
06:14  dabaR1: SpaceGhostC2C: the HTML is now valid, and it still does not conform.

06:23  dabaR1: THanks.
06:23  seancurtis: paul_irish: know of any nice way to target all browsers with a class on html - instead of just IE
06:23  seancurtis: thinking .ff .ff36 .ie7 .ie8 etc just added via JS
06:24  seancurtis: was originally going to have conditional comments for IE and then JS for others
06:24  phishbot: hey paul_irish :D
06:24  seancurtis: but would rather have one solution for all for simplicity
06:24  SpaceGhostC2C: I used to detect browser type and load in js or css depending on what browser was returned.
06:24  seancurtis: but guessing adding .ff36 will require user agent sniffing
06:24  seancurtis: which I wanted to avoid
06:25  paul_irish: hi phish
06:25  SpaceGhostC2C: There isn't another solution besides the if IE stuff.
06:25  paul_irish: seancurtis: i dont think you need to do that.
06:26  phishbot: looking for ideas for my link shortener / troller ... www.coolsitebro.com :D
06:26  seancurtis: paul_irish: so far we've gotten by on a combination of IE conditional stylesheets and some of your handy browser css hacks
06:26  seancurtis: but would prefer to just have .foo {...} .ie8 .foo {...} .ff36 .foo {...}
06:26  paul_irish: there's javascript to do it but you look like an asshole
06:26  phishbot: lol
06:26  paul_irish: i'm not convinced its neccessary
06:27  paul_irish: like
06:27  seancurtis: I think we could possible code our way around the css bugs we're getting
06:27  paul_irish: i think you can add heights and widths and write styles better so you dont need hacks
06:27  paul_irish: yes
06:27  seancurtis: but not always
06:27  paul_irish: anyway. the answer to your question is no way in html
06:27  paul_irish: css hacks (my page) for css based
06:27  seancurtis: nice way in JS?
06:27  paul_irish: and browserselector.js or whatever
06:28  seancurtis: k
06:28  paul_irish: which is fucking shitty
06:28  paul_irish: but hey  my name is in the changelog
06:28  seancurtis: doing an audit of our css now
06:28  seancurtis: we've dropped ff3 support
06:28  seancurtis: and saf 4
06:28  seancurtis: so that'll remove a lot of cruft
06:28  seancurtis: IE7 and IE8 can be conditional comments
06:28  dibs:  is there a way to tell if iframe or object tag content has loaded?
06:28  seancurtis: problem is when we run into chrome/ff bugs
06:33  dabaR1: All fixed. Thanks seancurtis

07:10  ManxPower: I have a page with divs with various content loaded via ajax.  I would like to hide the page until the content of the divs are finished loading.  ready() only seems to wait for the main document to load.  I have an forever loading iframe that writes the content to the divs.  Is there a way I can have jquery wait for some event I generate before hiding the loader div and showing the content div?
07:10  danheberden: that event could easily be a function call to your displayTheShit function.. but you can also use custom events or something like pubsub
07:11  danheberden: you could also keep track of if it's loaded or not
07:11  danheberden: and run a setTimeout in document ready to show the page regardless
07:11  danheberden: as a failsafe
07:11  ManxPower: danheberden, Typing out the question made me think of two ways I might do it.  8-)  I'll play with some code.

07:51 @coldhead: sure!
07:51 @coldhead: sounds fair
07:51  SpaceGhostC2C: Teach me how to use json?
07:51  danheberden: (coldhead doesn't know a lot about jquery though)
07:51  protechpr: basically my question is how do i handle json data with jquery?
07:51 @coldhead: can you be more specific, SpaceGhostC2C
07:51  SpaceGhostC2C: s/about jquery/
07:51  protechpr: SpaceGhostC2C i think we are on the same boat
07:51 @coldhead: then i can be more specific about how i don't know what you need to know
07:52  danheberden: protechpr: console.log(data) and investigate!
07:52  danheberden: its like csi, but cooler
07:52 @coldhead: ENHANCE
07:52  SpaceGhostC2C: coldhead: I've got a site, http://saputomedia.com/ and I'm going to write a simple gallery. I want to use json to store the info about it. Like the description, url and title.
07:52  SpaceGhostC2C: coldhead: I have a basic json file at http://saputomedia.com/js/gallery.json
07:53 @coldhead: no you don't

07:57 @coldhead: PROVIDED that is what the key is
07:57  seancurtis: danheberden: lol @ man baby
07:57 @coldhead: to which end: console.log(data)
07:58  protechpr: coldhead let me double check my json.
07:58 @coldhead: will show better than alert()
07:58 @coldhead: is a language still elegant if you need to use hasOwnProperty ?
07:59 @coldhead: i doubt it

08:08 @coldhead: SpaceGhostC2C: take out that ajaxStart stuff
08:08 @coldhead: we'll come back to that
08:11  protechpr: coldhead if i put the dataType where u said it behaves the same as before. if i put it where danheberden said the iframe hack brakes and i get a redirect to the json data on the browser.
08:12  protechpr: in the conosle i get the the resource is interpreted as document but transferred with mime type json
08:13 @coldhead: fuck
08:13 @coldhead: thanks for nothing, danheberden and coldhead
08:13 <-- coldhead has kicked coldhead from #jquery (YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING GOBSHITE)
08:14  coldhead: danheberden: fix it fix it fix it
08:14  danheberden: but i feel like i should kick myself too :(
08:14  danheberden: i feel SO SAD
08:14  coldhead: don't feel sad
08:14  coldhead: feel AWESOME
08:14  mytoz: unpossible
08:14  SpaceGhostC2C: coldhead: Okay, I now can has some json action happening.
08:15  aaroninfidel: danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/QE88X/1/
08:16  danheberden: protechpr: and the response body is your json?
08:16  protechpr: danheberden yes
08:16  danheberden: and content-type: application/json
08:17  protechpr: yes, if i do alert(data); i see the complete json response
08:17  danheberden: but i'm talking the request body in firebug
08:17  danheberden: or chrome dev tools
08:17  danheberden: you're looking there, ya?
08:18  danheberden: i'm worried you're getting more shit in there than your json
08:18  danheberden: well, not actively worried
08:18  danheberden: i got much bigger thigns to worry about
08:18  protechpr: like the economy :P
08:18  danheberden: like coldhead, bless his heart
08:18  protechpr: well, what i get in the chrome console is this: Resource interpreted as document but transferred with MIME type application/json.
08:19  protechpr: there's no XHR since it's a file upload and it's done in an iframe hack i believe
08:19  danheberden: ugh that sounds awful
08:19  protechpr: moving to firefox see what i get there
08:19  danheberden: i've not used the iframe hack thing-a-majig
08:20  protechpr: is there another way to do ajax file upload?
08:20  danheberden: my best is the application/json isn't gonna work in the iframe
08:20  danheberden: best *guess
08:20  aaroninfidel: can someone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/QE88X/2/ basically, when you mouse over the slider stops, and when you click the left or right side of the slider it goes to the next image, however, the slider continues on and ignores the initial hover function even though the state is still on hover.
08:21  danheberden: there's always swfupload
08:21  danheberden: and html5 has options
08:21  danheberden: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ajaxform-appears-to-alter-returned-data @ protechpr
08:22  protechpr: in firefox it tried to download a plain text file containig the json. but i can see the post and the json response in firebug

08:24  protechpr: danheberden ew. i see. moving to HTML5. hope it does ajax. :(
08:25  Northwoods: $(this.form).name , to get the name of form
08:25  coldhead: look i know this is going to sound harsh but you really have to ask yourself if whatever you're doing is worth bothering with
08:25  coldhead: because most people just use facebook now
08:26  coldhead: there's not much point in other sites
08:26  coldhead: no one will ever visit
08:26  Northwoods: lol
08:26  coldhead: it's sad, i know
08:26  coldhead: i'm sorry
08:26  Northwoods: but its true
08:26  Northwoods: i dont know why people clone facebook
08:27  Northwoods: you go to elance , you will find many such openings
08:27  coldhead: too late, sheeple
08:27  coldhead: TOO LATE
08:28  Northwoods: $(this.form).name , to get the name of form ?
08:28  coldhead: .attr('name'
08:28  Northwoods: thanks
08:28  coldhead: )+
08:28  danheberden: ahh.. the sheets of paper in the toilet one hack, been doing that for years
08:28  zjwalden: maybe facebook will end up like myspace... heh
08:28  coldhead: we live in hope
08:28  coldhead: live and fap
08:29  zjwalden: truth is though, you're probably right
08:29  zjwalden: i have clients call all day, i wanna do this and that, social site, nda
08:29  zjwalden: and i'm like look
08:29  zjwalden: i'll take your money.. but..
08:29  zjwalden: :P
08:29  Northwoods: lol
08:29  zjwalden: i gotta be honest with them, i can't lie to them
08:29  Northwoods: 100,000 social sites already
08:29  Northwoods: i mean wtf
08:30  zjwalden: and if they wanted something on par, we're talking large amounts of money, and seo, server allocation
08:30  zjwalden: usually they're like well.. okay
08:30  iszak: zjwalden, I know what you mean :l
08:30  Jarda: why is curreent day with ui-state-highlight in datepicker
08:30  iszak: so you can highlight the current day..
08:30  Jarda: in my theme highlight is a lot more agressive than ui-state-active
08:31  Jarda: so the initial guess would be that the highilighted would be the selected day
08:31  Jarda: (I'm using it inline)
08:31  zjwalden: anyway, night guys, have a great night. it's 1:30 here, i got work early in the morning, we're moving tomorrow after work across town.. i should've been in bed
08:31  zjwalden: ahh.. the life of a webdev :D

09:05  krz: background color does not set

09:06  Jarda: hrr... I have this complicated php template that prints a complicated table of several rows.. Now I would have to add support to inject stuff with javascript to the table
09:06  temp01: so check firebug and see if the style is getting overwritten krz
09:06  krz: im doing this in firebug
09:06  krz: so it is supposed to override
09:07  Jarda: should I use some <tr id="mycustomsyntaxforselector"></tr> magic or how should you add info for javascript to the table elements?
09:07  Jarda: the data has to be set when looping

10:37  Bjornet: HI, I want to RE:store a PHP $var so that I can use it with my jQuery.
10:37  Bjornet: This is what I have now:
10:37  Bjornet: var jqueryvar + "<?php foreach($authorLastname AS $authors){echo $authors;} ?>";
10:39  Sypher|NL: strangest part is that the response contains the correct HTML code
10:39  Bjornet: it is quite close but still not. Cant figure out the syntax.. is there an easier way? $authorLastname is an array([0] => 'name1, [1] => 'name2)
10:40  temp01: encode it as json
10:41  temp01: var jqueryvar = <?php echo json_encode($arr) ?>;
10:41  temp01: alert(jqueryvar[1]) //yay
10:41  Bjornet: temp01: oh thats new.
10:41  Bjornet: Ill try it. What is the idea?
10:41  temp01: much like urself
10:41  Bjornet: ^^
10:41  temp01: the idea is that you encode it as string
10:42  temp01: and echo it. that then gets parsed as object when the .js script executes
10:43  Bjornet: now Im not even born yet. Ill try it
10:43  hmd: Why is everyone pronouncing "route" as "raut" all of a sudden.
10:43  temp01: Why are you asking that question in #jquery?
10:44  MrSamuel: because not everyone is american?
10:44  hmd: No, I mean, US people.
10:44  hmd: TV people even
10:44  hmd: in USA.
10:44  hmd: MrSamuel, I'll let you know, as soon as possible :/
10:45  MrSamuel: Well, personally, I see it as being two words: root and route
10:45  MrSamuel: they are pronounced differently
10:45  MrSamuel: I guess it depends on social context
10:46  hmd: MrSamuel, no one I know of sings it "On [raut] 66" ...
10:46  hmd: Yet everyone says [raut]
10:46  hmd: It doesn't agree with itself :/
10:46  MrSamuel: hmd: In New Zealand, people will prefer to use "raut" 66
10:47  MrSamuel: because the word "root" has sexual connotations
10:47  MrSamuel: but, generally, the two are on fairly level grounds for that particular usage
10:47  hmd: Sexual connotations?
10:47  hmd: Like what

11:02  Sypher|NL: i'm trying to replace a DIV with content retrieved using .load()
11:02  Sypher|NL: it makes the div empty, does not put in anything
11:02  Sypher|NL: $('#mydata').html( response );
11:02  Sypher|NL: isn't doing anything either
11:02  temp01: make sure the html you are loading is 100% valid
11:02  moi: yep
11:02  Sypher|NL: but if i do text() it is there, as plaintext
11:02  temp01: obviously
11:02  sean`: .load ('url', function (html) { console.log (html); }
11:03  temp01: .load('url', function(html){ console.log(html) }
11:03  sean`: hahaa

12:12  thiago_: Cork, i checked with firebug, i have no js errors and the response is exactly the text that i need to receive but it's still don't entering on the success callback =( with other urls it works.

12:15  mekwall: totally off-topic, but do anyone of you guys have experience with the LG full led TVs LE8500 or LX9500?
12:16  Carneque: I actually designed both of those models
12:16  Carneque: sorry, that was a joke
12:16  mekwall: well I don't care much for design anyway
12:16  Carneque: what are you doin' askin about tvs in JQuery?
12:17  Carneque: what do you need help with I mean
12:17  mekwall: I'm usually helping here ;)
12:17  Carneque: I think you've helped me before actually
12:17  mekwall: possibly
12:17  mekwall: that's why I said it was off-topic :P
12:17  Carneque: So what are you doin with those tvs?
12:18  mekwall: might buy one of them
12:18  JKarsrud: LX sounds better by name, but I have no idea
12:18  mekwall: LX and LE are both the same
12:18  Northwoods: upon submit , how can check if alteast one of the $('.aCredit') checkboxes is checked
12:18  mekwall: except 3D :)
12:18  mekwall: LX got 3D
12:18  mekwall: which I don't need
12:18  JKarsrud: Northwoods: $('.aCredit:checked') ?
12:18  EtotheK: how i can remove <script> tag from head
12:18  EtotheK: ?
12:18  mekwall: I still thing that the whole 3D-thing is way too immature
12:19  JKarsrud: if the length of that is 0, then none are checked
12:19  Northwoods: JKarsrud: they are more than 1 in number
12:19  JKarsrud: mekwall: yeah, I just said LX sound cooler by name :)
12:19  Cork: EtotheK: as i already said, removing the tag WON'T help...
12:19  Carneque: yeah don't buy a 3D man
12:19  Cork: EtotheK: the code isn't bount to the script tag
12:19  Carneque: Samsung is the best brand though
12:19  mekwall: I won't :) why I was asking with both models is because they are literally the same... so if someone had experience with LX9500 that would help as well
12:19  JKarsrud: Northwoods: If you don't check any of them, and console.log($('.aCredit:checked').length) ?
12:19  JKarsrud: What does that return?
12:20  EtotheK: so i dont understad what i can do
12:20  Northwoods: ah , right
12:20  mekwall: JKarsrud, sure does :P but then again I could just go buy a B&O BeoVision 10 :p
12:20  vivek40: Hi can queries related to jquery UI be posted here or is there a separate room for it .. a newbie here
12:20  JKarsrud: B&O rocks actually
12:20  JKarsrud: Thought I'm a Pioneer man myself
12:20  mekwall: sure... but I don't want to pay 80% just for the brand
12:20  JKarsrud: s/thought/though
12:21  Cork: EtotheK: the script you load, has to wrap and store EVERYTHING in a scope (function() {})
12:21  mekwall: Pioneer Kuro was king, and is still used as reference by many reviewers
12:21  JKarsrud: Kuro rocks

12:24  Carneque: http://www.adamhott.nl/cyberbunker/index2.php
12:24  mekwall: Carneque, what does console.log on cookie.length say?
12:24  steveccc: can anyone spare 5 mins to have a look at http://www.teamderby.com/newsite/contactus.php - i have a popup menu when you hover over "about us" which I close on mouse over the animated image or one of the left menu li elements or the topbanner.  - I want to also make it hide based on moving directly upwards or to the left - can anyone advise the best way to do that?
12:25  Carneque: I didn't debug it, sorry
12:25  mekwall: dinosaadeh, que?
12:25  dinosaadeh: mekwall: que?
12:25  mekwall: Carneque, well that step numero uno ;)
12:26  mekwall: dinosaadeh, yeah... windows 7 taskbar button hover effect? do you mean when hovering the different icons or the start button?
12:26  mekwall: I would say that it's very much possible to do it
12:26  dinosaadeh: mekwall: the programs buttons, u know, depending onthe position of ur mouse, the highlight follows the mouse
12:27  mekwall: dinosaadeh, sure... you would need to have a bg which has a radial gradient that you move when the mouse moves
12:27  vivek40: ok.. how do i change the height and width of the datepicker of jquery UI. I find it just too big for my site. I am quite new to this, looked at the theme roller but it has nothing to say of the height, width of the datepicker (I had got disconnected , so reposting)
12:28  mekwall: vivek40, http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-height
12:29  dinosaadeh: mekwall: thanks
12:30  Carneque: mekwall, I'm bad at debuggin' would it be console.log.cookie.length ?
12:30  unomi: console.log(whatever)
12:30  Carneque: I know the if else statement is working because it runs the animation on the first visit then sets the cookie in the browser
12:30  Carneque: console.log(cookie.length);
12:31  Carneque: It says it is undefined
12:31  vivek40: thanks mekwall: but I did this $( "#dateinput" ).datepicker({ maxHeight: 10 }) but it does not work
12:33  poppiez: hi, I want to remove a loaded image completely from memory. should I first set its src attribute to a tiny image and then remove it or is it completely save to just use remove()?
12:34  doonie: remove
12:34  doonie: can't remove it from memory, os does that. you can jut remove from the dom
12:35  poppiez: doonie: well, I was just thinking if you change its src attribute you will make the OS replace the memory required for the original image with the tiny one
12:36  doonie: dont you think it will load both images in memory
12:36  doonie: I don't think it associates <img tag with an image in the memory
12:36  poppiez: doonie: no I didn't think so since the tiny image technique is used on the ipad
12:36  poppiez: but that's two different devices though
12:36  doonie: it is? well I can't speak for the great ipad ;>
12:37  doonie: that is somewhat weird
12:37  poppiez: doonie: but if you say remove() is perfectly fine I guess there's some kind of memory leak in my code. or in firefox anyway. the great memory leak monster
12:37  doonie: :) that might be true
12:38  doonie: did you try setting the src to something else?
12:38  doonie: i guess it would still leak, just less heh
12:39  poppiez: doonie: yeah I guess so. I've tried changing the src attribute. no obvious effects

12:43  doonie: hehe
12:43  doonie: change the k to c and yer done

12:56  dinosaadeh: mekwall:  seems this last one is not showing any BG even on hover

13:00  dinosaadeh: mekwall: no gradiant is showing at all
13:00  mekwall: working here
13:00  rrreimer: I'm afk for 10 min
13:00  hmd: blackspotwiggins, I see that it returns itself, very nice. What would happen if I load jQuery and then I load it again? I need to run two versions of jQuery at once (one of them with a custom alias and removed conflicts, of course)
13:01  hemanth: rrreimer, okies
13:01  coldhead: have fun rrreimer
13:01  blackspotwiggins: hmd, if you need two jquery instances you are already doing something weird
13:01  coldhead: hmd: its possible but there are lots of caveats
13:02  hmd: coldhead, what are they?
13:02  coldhead: its possible like incest is possible, you still shouldn't do it
13:02  coldhead: .data() for example
13:02  coldhead: doesn't expect to work with another jquery
13:02  dinosaadeh: mekwall: ah.. i think it does not work on chrome
13:02  coldhead: synchronisation can be tricky
13:02  mekwall: I told you dino
13:02  hmd: coldhead, as in each would maintain separate data()? That's fine by me. Or you mean it'll be unpredictable
13:02  mekwall: I am working on it for ff first
13:03  dinosaadeh: mekwall: it works on ff
13:03  dinosaadeh: oh lol, sorry
13:03  dinosaadeh: hehe
13:03  mekwall: jsfiddle is borky on chrome for me
13:03  mekwall: cant copy paste :P
13:03  coldhead: hmd: i think they can conflict depending on the versions
13:03  coldhead: its a murky area
13:03  hmd: coldhead, I use jQuery on an integrateable component that should expect to land on a page that may use jQuery already
13:03  coldhead: but good to luck to you
13:03  dinosaadeh: mekwall: what about pastebin =P
13:03  hmd: I offer the devs to expose the jQuery I load and just use it..
13:04  hmd: But..
13:04  coldhead: hmd: that might be okay, if you don't mess with much in your componenet
13:04  hmd: The default is to be invisible. I guess I'll inspect the code. Aside from data() what should I check as well?
13:05  coldhead: hmd: i just remember data problems, i guess the caveat is to try and see
13:05  hmd: Ok, thanks, coldhead.
13:06  Deele: hey
13:06  coldhead: hi Deele
13:06  oodavid: is there a way to pack all :input elements for AJAX?
13:07  coldhead: ?serialize
13:07  bot-t: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
13:07  oodavid: coldhead: you sexy man
13:07  Deele: coldhead, can I use $.ajax({ url: "ajax.php", error: $("#obj_genResult").html(""); } cause it is cursing on me :P
13:07  oodavid: (or woman)
13:07  oodavid: ETC
13:08  Deele: coldhead, I mean, error: can be used same as success or can't?
13:08  coldhead: hmm, do you maybe mean error: function () {ur junk here} ?
13:08  Deele: coldhead, ok
13:08  dinosaadeh: mekwall: i am trying to make it work on other browsers it seems only about gradient generation.. i assumewebkit is for IE
13:12  rrreimer: hemanth: did it work?
13:12  hemanth: rrreimer, no :(
13:12  coldhead: that was never 10 minutes
13:13  rrreimer: 11, but I took my time (1 min) to read the last posts ;)
13:13  coldhead: Deele: any good?
13:13  Deele: coldhead, not cursing, atleast :P
13:14  hemanth: rrreimer, it says error at  the first });
13:16  rrreimer: hemanth: http://pastebin.com/acBS7jye
13:17  hemanth: rrreimer, trying :)
13:18  rrreimer: if the first doesn't work there is other code causing the problem
13:18  rrreimer: if so post the complete script
13:19  Wipster: hey, what would be the best way to add the .click event to a couple of div which are being generated in the result of a post to a php
13:19  rrreimer: Wipster: $("your div selector").click(function(event){}); ?
13:21  rrreimer: do these divs have a specific class or id to identify them? I mean do you use something like ".result"? then it's easy to only select these divs
13:21  mekwall: dinosaadeh, http://jsfiddle.net/ZQCae/9/ <--- with fadein effect
13:22  hemanth: rrreimer, failed! here is the paste http://www.jsfiddle.net/sWakf/
13:22  Wipster: rrreimer, yeh they have a class but it seems the .click doesn't get associated with them as they are made after the document is ready...

13:24  JKarsrud: Yan_Nick: map the text of the h2's, loop that and insert li's into the ul?
13:24 --- Mimo_ is now known as Mimo
13:25  Wipster: rrreimer, ok thanks
13:25  Yan_Nick: JKarsrud: yeah, but how to do that?
13:25  toxz: hi! to create a new div i do: $('<div/>');      - correct?
13:25  Yan_Nick: $("h2.pane-title").text(); is for getting the text but then?
13:25  Yan_Nick: -but +and
13:25  hemanth: rrreimer,  $('#dframe') i had named it hackframe b4 :)

13:26  AlexC_: morning
13:26  dinosaadeh: mekwall: big teaser, just hope it is crossbrowser
13:27  Yan_Nick: sean`: :D
13:27  mekwall: dinosaadeh, there are functions to do this in ie, webkit and mozilla
13:27  mekwall: but they do it in different ways
13:27  mekwall: so have to implement them one by one
13:28  AlexC_: I'm using 1.4.3 however when doing the following it makes it so *anything* I click on, even the body, show "bar" $("#serviceTabs ul.tabs li:not(:first) a").live( "click", function() {alert("bar")} );
13:28  AlexC_: removing the ":not(:first)" fixes this, but I don't want it to select the first li
13:29  rrreimer: hemanth: first of all style ≠ script
13:29  rrreimer: <script type="text/css">
13:29  Yan_Nick: JKarsrud: http://jsbin.com/eqelu5/2/edit =
13:29  rrreimer: that could be the reason but I'll test it in Aptana

14:29  unfo-: hemanth, check autocomplete docs for how to use select
14:29  hemanth: unfo-, can i get the value with 'e'
14:29  unfo-: hemanth, dunno, haven't used that plugin

14:34  kasad: anyone have nerves to give me idea how to solve really stupid issue which will take me at least 5 lines of text to explain
14:36  SugaSlide: sup sup
14:36  Wiggin: kasad: Try and hope someone does.
14:36  SugaSlide: hope somone can help
14:37  SugaSlide: need to do an "include" type thing..
14:37  kasad: I have some really long and boring dataset retreived from the db, (it's actually a register of deeds and contracts and stuff like that, ie every doc/paper/whatever that is received or sent during a workday in a company), so naturaly, I save it in a table consisting of x columns, but the trick is that when I want to display the data I can't display it just like simple grid, because of some retarded standard that requires certain fields to be displayed in one t
14:37  SugaSlide: got a page that other sites need to include in themselves
14:37  SugaSlide: whats the best way to do it?
14:37  kasad: so it's not just field1 field2 field3, but it's actually field1 Verticalfield(field2+field3+field4), field 5 etc etc, it has to be displayed that way because of standard that such register books come in. Now, I was lazy and used jquery to format the data and display it on screen so it looks the way it looks in the official register book.
14:38  Wiggin: SugaSlide: http://www.cryer.co.uk/resources/javascript/script17_include_js_from_js.htm ?
14:39  Wiggin: SugaSlide: I assume you're talking about javascript? If you're talking about standard HTML just use $.load
14:39  kasad: now, everything works fine and dandy, but now they requested to be able to export, actually just download mentioned table (actually part of it which they choose to display, by date or some other criteria) as MS EXCEL file
14:39  SugaSlide: lol
14:39  kasad: now i know i could send a header something like header("Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel");
14:40  kasad: and just dump the table and it would load nicely
14:40  SugaSlide: Wiggin i want on our site to supply the "client" with a script tag with pre filled options etc... for them to place on their own site
14:40  kasad: but the thing is, i already written everything using javascript
14:40  kasad: so table is actually formatted client side >___<
14:40  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQCae/23/
14:41  Beam: is it possible to get the calculated height of a hidden(display:none) element?
14:41  Wiggin: kasad: A roundabout way would be to send the formatted data to a server-side script to convert to an excel file.
14:41  Wiggin: SugaSlide: prefilled options?
14:41  antti_s: hemanth: bind to 'change' instead of 'select'
14:41  SugaSlide: meh
14:42  kasad: Wiggin: good idea, i could just post whole innerHTML of a grid placeholder back to server
14:42  kasad: and then spit it out with proper headers
14:42  kasad: that what you meant?
14:42  SugaSlide: <script> load the page now, k thanks </script>
14:42  sean`: mekwall, sexy
14:42  SugaSlide: http://classifieds.zoutnet.co.za/?key=fe45897650bcf550c9defc4520ab3313#cID=s-3&txt=
14:42  SugaSlide: thats the page it must load
14:42  Wiggin: kasad: More or less.
14:42  mekwall: sean`, thx ;)
14:42  kasad: i would really like to find a way to save me some time and not write formatting of table again in php
14:43  SugaSlide: sup mekwall
14:43  kasad: Wiggin: thanks for the tip, you are my hero for today, i need more breaks why i didn't think of that >_<
14:43  Wiggin: SugaSlide: So what's stopping you from using load?
14:43  Wiggin: kasad: You're welcome :)
14:43  SugaSlide: if the client doesnt have jQuery
14:43  SugaSlide: it fails
14:43  kasad: SugaSlide: i didn't read ya, still don't understand what's the issue?
14:43  SugaSlide: :P
14:43  hemanth: antti_s, no response this time, after changing it to change
14:44  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQCae/25/
14:44  mekwall: even better ;)
14:44  Bertrandio: anybody know if there's a #probability channel?
14:44  SugaSlide: this isnt necisarily a jquery question btw... its a "hope there are other devs out there that can shed some light on best way to do this"
14:44  hemanth: antti_s,    change: function(e) { must i access the value from e?
14:44  mekwall: looks really weird in ie thought :D
14:44  mekwall: though*
14:45  Wiggin: SugaSlide: 't have jquery? Just include an additional script tag calling jquery then.
14:45  SugaSlide: that page... must somehow be displayed inside another site/// s say the user goes to www.domain.com/adverts.html
14:45  SugaSlide: domain.coms banner / nav is on that page
14:45  SugaSlide: and theres a place where they place some code..
14:45  SugaSlide: and then my page.. gets loaded there
14:46  mekwall: dinosaadeh, seen the latest? ;)
14:46  Xenc: Hey is anyone aware of a way to mark points on google map to generate a kml?
14:46  Xenc: like, click on each part like a dot-to-dot
14:46  dinosaadeh: mekwall: yep, thanks =D was trying to add rounded edges to the box as to look like a cool button
14:47  kasad: SugaSlide: so why don't give them code whre they include both jquery and your script?
14:47  mekwall: dinosaadeh, http://jsfiddle.net/ZQCae/26/ ? :)
14:47  Wiggin: SugaSlide: If you have to include it within one script, then just use document.write("<script src='jquery.js'> </script>"), maybe use setTimeout, and you're done?
14:48  mekwall: dinosaadeh, looks best in ff tbh
14:48  hemanth: antti_s, worked, but takes a long time to load, can i have a loading msg>
14:48  mekwall: ie is bugged.... need to work more on that one
14:48  SugaSlide: was hoping for something like google analytics type block lol
14:48  dinosaadeh: mekwall: YOU ARE THE MAN!
14:48  SugaSlide: gonna have to do a if jQuery exists on the page then dont include the .js
14:48  SugaSlide: and do a load
14:48  sean`: HE GUYS
14:49  hemanth: antti_s, i also get The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
14:49  sean`: <SugaSlide> if the client doesnt have jQuery ?
14:49  sean`: wtf
14:49  mekwall: dinosaadeh, hehe thx... I'll be able to animate the color of the borders as well
14:49  mekwall: and click effect
14:49  SugaSlide: sean` not EVERY site on the net has jQuery included
14:49  sean`: oh
14:50  sean`: like that
14:50  sean`: I thoguht you ment browser client
14:50  sean`: SugaSlide, what do you want to do?
14:50  SugaSlide: if their site doesnt have it i need to place it in... if it exists... loading ANOTHER jquery.js file fails everything on the page
14:50  SugaSlide: i need to include a page
14:50  SugaSlide: :(
14:50  sean`: a js file
14:50  sean`: create a script elmeent
14:50  SugaSlide: domain.com must load a page from xyx.com
14:51  sean`: You'd have to use JSONP
14:51  SugaSlide: thought there would be another way like expanding iframe etc
14:51  sean`: not that hard
14:51  kjy112: what's a good irc client for OSX?
14:53  ambackstrom|fsck: kjy112: i'm trying out textual right now, seems nice.
14:53  antti_s: hemanth: meh... actually use the select event, and pass it the event and the ui object as parameters. you can get the selected value via ui.item.value
14:54  SugaSlide: sean` http://www.zoutnet.co.za/demo.php
14:54  sean`: coza?
14:54  SugaSlide: South Africa
14:55  sean`: SugaSlide, do you want an iframe
14:55  sean`: or do you want to load the html
14:55  SugaSlide: lol
14:55  SugaSlide: what would the best option be?
14:55  sean`: you decide
14:55  sean`: do you want: http://classifieds.zoutnet.co.za/?key=fe45897650bcf550c9defc4520ab3313#cID=s-3&txt=
14:55  SugaSlide: the classifieds page uses ajax
14:55  sean`: or do you just want a ipece?
14:55  sean`: an iframe would be the best
14:55  SugaSlide: so im not sure an expanding iframe will work
14:56  SugaSlide: since it doesnt know the height
14:56  sean`: because the page includes stylesheets
14:56  sean`: scripts
14:56  sean`: they might fuck up the page
14:56  SugaSlide: ye
14:56  DonkeyCongo: Why does this (http://pastebin.com/VyEFukjf) not stop the link from redirecting? If I put an alert() before return;, it works 0.0
14:56  sean`: so you use an iframe for this osrt of things
14:56  SugaSlide: yips
14:56  hemanth: antti_s, e.item.value in my case?
14:56  sean`: DonkeyCongo, just do $(this.parentNode)
14:57  DonkeyCongo: sean`: Thanks
14:57  sean`: that is exactly the same as $(this).parent ('.ob') BUT faster
14:57  sean`: DonkeyCongo, are hyou using jquery 1.4.3
14:57  DonkeyCongo: sean`: Ye
14:57  sean`: this shuold work
14:57  sean`: try a jsfiddle
14:58  hemanth: antti_s, worked, wow its dam fast now :), is there a way to have tab completion rather than the drop down?
14:59  DonkeyCongo: sean`: http://jsfiddle.net/QAWAm/
15:00  oodavid: is there a way of looping over a group of objects in a specific order (based on a property)
15:00  sean`: DonkeyCongo, you're preventing the mousedown
15:00  sean`: not the click
15:00  sean`: also.. you're missing );
15:00  timing: oodavid: first sort them and then loop like you would do?
15:01  oodavid: timing: you can't sort an object though
15:01  oodavid: (unless I'm missing something)
15:01  kasad: hemanth: like this? http://mislav.net/scripts/autocomplete.html
15:02  sean`: hemanth, like www.jsoncole.com
15:02  nchase_: how can you use jquery to choose the first option of a select element when that first option has no value? `$(#menu).val(0)' just makes the select menu blank
15:02  timing: oodavid: yeah i'm thinking that too, but it might be possible
15:02  timing: and if you first make an array of objects?
15:02  DonkeyCongo: sean`: Weird. I was using click, but changed it to mousedown to see if that would help. Seems like it's working now, thanks a lot :)
15:02  timing: so you have this object:
15:03  oodavid: timing: just writing a fiddle
15:03  hemanth: kasad, yes :)

15:04  AlexC_: when doing: $(this).css("background-position"); in MSIE8 I am just getting "undefined" back, works fine in every other browser - what is going on? Same on 1.4.2 and 1.4.3
15:04  sean`: hemanth, jsconsole.com
15:04  sean`: type in 'session'

15:06  sean`: yeah
15:06  sean`: easy
15:06  sean`: and it's rem yes
15:06  sean`: code is available on github
15:06  hemanth: sean`, also to fetch the value
15:07  sean`: fetching is always the same
15:07  sean`: no matter what
15:07  sean`: you have a resource, see if it's there, if so, display if not don
15:07  sean`: t
15:07  oodavid: timing: http://jsfiddle.net/oodavid/6Khtv/
15:07  sean`: resource can be an array, object, string, xhr call.. whateffs
15:07  hemanth: sean`, me working on  this http://www.jsfiddle.net/sWakf/4/
15:07  oodavid: I would use an array, but I need the id keys for reference :S
15:08  sean`: hemanth, that's jquery ui
15:08  timing: oodavid: going to dig up some old code, moment pls
15:08  sean`: you need to hack it to do this afaik
15:09  oodavid: timing: you legend
15:09  hemanth: sean`, okies :)
15:09  Rinthe: if i want to apply the same function to two different selections, do i need to copy the function again or is there a way to select 2 things at once?
15:09  SpaceGhostC2C: Hey, I'm wondering how to get my menu above the horizontal rule on http://saputomedia.com how would I do that?
15:10  SpaceGhostC2C: If you comment out the line   <script src="js/lib/jquery.dropmenu-1.1.3.js"></script> you can see how I want it to look.
15:10  Rinthe: say i want to select a.class1 and a.class2 together
15:10  Rinthe: how can i do that?
15:10  AlexC_: wtf. Why in MSIE do you have to use 'background-position-x' instead of 'background-position' with $(this).css()?
15:10  SpaceGhostC2C: AlexC_: It's IE...
15:11  AlexC_: SpaceGhostC2C: sure, though jQuery should really take this into account similar to how it does float, cssFloat and styleFloat
15:11  Rinthe: anyone?
15:11  AlexC_: Rinthe: http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
15:11  SpaceGhostC2C: Rinthe: Patience is for the awesome.

15:31  Cork: fuchstronaut: you can relay on the order
15:31  fuchstronaut: in my case this is not working for some reason
15:31  Cork: fuchstronaut: your basically pushing it into an array
15:31  timing: oodavid: yeah, that's what I said: 15:02:35 < timing> and if you first make an array of objects?
15:32  timing: oodavid: but great you thought of it yourself :-)
15:32  fuchstronaut: for me it is returning an object with the order they are in the dom
15:32  fuchstronaut: not how i pushed them
15:32  fuchstronaut: what did i screw up?
15:32  timing: oodavid: and you can just use for(.. in ..) to iterate the object
15:32  SpaceGhostC2C: Hey, I'm trying to get http://saputomedia.com/ to look like http://saputomedia.com/index2.html but with the dropmenu script working on the first. The menu is beneath the horizontal rule and I want it above it like in index2.html
15:33  Cork: ?source add: function( selector, context ) { @ fuchstronaut
15:33  bot-t: Line#3830 - "add: function( selector, context ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#line-3830
15:34  SugaSlide: inside a page thats being loaded into an iframe.. how do i change the parents height?
15:34  oodavid: timing: yeah, it's a pain having both the object and the reference array though
15:34  SugaSlide: like... iframe load page.. inside page tell iframe to be 400px high
15:34  oodavid: timing: so I'll go about removing the need for the array by recreating the object
15:34  SugaSlide: without loading jquery into the top page
15:35  g0rd0n: how can i reset a <ul> list? i want to remove all <li> contained in it

15:36  Xenc: $('ul').children('li').remove();

15:36  timing: uhm no
15:36  timing: $('ul').get(0).innerHTML = '';
15:37  timing: but empty is the best :-)
15:37  Xenc: markj's suggestion is probably cleanest
15:37  Xenc: yea, agreed
15:37  timing: you can also just NOT make the list at all
15:37  timing: then there is no need to remove the items
15:38  g0rd0n: yeah
15:38  g0rd0n: empty looks cool and works
15:38  fuchstronaut: thanks Cork, but this looks like a little too much of information for a simpleminded person like me

16:02  kasad: must be someone from the company i'm writing this project for trying to log in with ie6
16:04  kasad: luckily since it's small company (under 40 employees) i enforce them to use modern browser or provide them with AIR app, which is basicaly just a plain iframe with added back forward, refresh and close buttons which points to the server's index page
16:04  kasad: and they call it a "client software" :P

16:43  Xyndrome_lapt: as you can see, I'm calling an external php file, and inside this is 1 function
16:44  Xyndrome_lapt: and this is get_status()
16:44  Xyndrome_lapt: but my question is how do I call it from within content on line 7 there
16:47  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQCae/41/show/
16:47  mekwall: hmm
16:47  mekwall: I wonder why the hovering effect is so different in webkit and mozilla

16:49  mytoz: mekwall: that's pretty cool! :)
16:50  mekwall: mytoz, thx
16:51  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: the php executes when the page is rendered, not when the javascript function is called.
16:51  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: either load the data into javascript when the page is loaded, or create some ajax endpoint that can run get_status() on the alt value and return the result
16:52  Xyndrome_lapt: oh, that's valuable info:o
16:52  Xyndrome_lapt: but got no clue about ajax
16:52  mytoz: you need better conceptual understanding of how php, ajax, and the web works, Xyndrome_lapt.
16:53  mytoz: read up and try to get a good mental picture of how it works.
16:53  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: ajax allows you to pull some new content from the server in the background, via javascript. you can request a new URL in the background and do something with the data that's returned
16:54  Xyndrome_lapt: I really do, but this is absolutely not my field of work:p I guess I was just hoping to leach some solution;p
16:55  ambackstrom|fsck: how many possible area tags/statuses are we talking about, here?
16:55  ambackstrom|fsck: do you know what they will be when the page loads?
16:55 --- tj is now known as tjholowaychuk
16:56  Xyndrome_lapt: we are talking about 9 area tags, and the value of them will be a predefined number that works as an id
16:57  Xyndrome_lapt: before I had all the area tags change their alt tag through php on page load
16:57  Xyndrome_lapt: this slowed down the page load horribly
16:59  nvictor: how can i achieve the same popup box that twitter now has to tweet messages?
16:59  ambackstrom|fsck: can't twitterFeed.php do the get_status() call itself?
16:59  Xyndrome_lapt: how do you mean?
17:00  ambackstrom|fsck: nvictor: have you looked at jquery ui's Dialog? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
17:00  ambackstrom|fsck: though i'm not sure you could get that exact styling
17:01  nvictor: ambackstrom|fsck: seems like a good start
17:01 --- clown is now known as clown_afk
17:01  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: qtip is making an ajax call, since you specific a url argument. why not pass your data as {alt:$(this).attr('alt')} and then have twitterFeed.php do the translation?
17:02  ambackstrom|fsck: or is get_status() part of twitterFeed.php?
17:03  luxigo: do you know how to display "hello" on the same line than the jqueryui triangle ? $(document.body).html('<div><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></span>hello</div>')  doesnt work....
17:03  Xyndrome_lapt: yeah, it's the only function inside twitterFeed.php
17:03  Xyndrome_lapt: http://pastebin.org/392818
17:04  Xyndrome_lapt: that is twitterFeed.php

17:07  nvictor: ajpiano: like you told me last time :)
17:07  nvictor: ajpiano: with the CDN
17:07  ajpiano: oh ok
17:07  nvictor: no wait a min
17:07  ambackstrom|fsck: if you really did it in that order, without a document.ready check, you're trying to display the dialog before the dom node exists
17:07  nvictor: i did not on that particular page
17:09  nvictor: ajpiano: you life saver :)
17:09  nvictor: on thing tho
17:09  nvictor: what i need is a button
17:09  nvictor: which when clicked on will open my dialog
17:09  nvictor: it's just opening when the page loads...
17:10  nvictor: btw jquery has custom buttons?
17:10  ambackstrom|fsck: jquery ui has custom button styles, if that's what you mean
17:10  nvictor: it does :)
17:10  nvictor: yes
17:11  fuchstronaut: is there a way to make jquery keep the order items where added (using .add()) to a jquery object
17:11  nvictor: wow
17:11  nvictor: since when html has a <button> element?
17:11  nvictor: is it IE-proof?
17:11  fuchstronaut: yes

17:12  fuchstronaut: button is html4
17:12  MichaelBehan: Has anyone experienced the bounce animation not working in IE7/8? IE only seem to process the last cycle of the animation
17:12  MichaelBehan: which is setting display to block
17:12  fuchstronaut: i guess its not used that mch because ppl tend to use input
17:12  MichaelBehan: So I experience the delay that the animation would take, but I only see the 'last frame' of it
17:14  nvictor: ambackstrom|fsck: can i create a dialog on the fly without having to declare an html tag?
17:14  ajpiano: $("<div>").dialog()
17:15  nvictor: ajpiano: so $('button.replyhere').button().click($('<div>').dialog()); ?
17:15  ajpiano: what
17:15  ajpiano: no
17:15  nvictor: :)
17:15  nvictor: s'ry
17:15  nvictor: how is it done?
17:16  ajpiano: you have to pass a function to the click metho
17:16  ajpiano: not...
17:16  ajpiano: the body of a function
17:16  Xyndrome_lapt: ambackstrom|fsck: got a clue for me?:)
17:16  ajpiano: nvictor: is the body of the dialog going to be static, or you do need to change the data during the course of the page's lifecycle
17:16  nvictor: ajpiano: static, it will be a form
17:17  nvictor: ajpiano: no dynamic rather
17:17  ajpiano: nvictor, k, then the right way is to instantiate the dialog on page load, and use a click event on a button to open or close it
17:17  ajpiano: gah
17:17  nvictor: because some info would need to be filled in
17:17  serio__: if you bind to anything twice it just does it twice?
17:17  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: you should read up a bit on ajax to better understand how jquery can pull data down from a page on the server in the background. i don't have any good links handy, sorry
17:17  nvictor: like which ad you are replying to
17:17  ajpiano: click(function() { });
17:17  serio__: it wasn't always like that, was it?
17:18  nvictor: ajpiano: alright
17:18  nvictor: thanks
17:18  ambackstrom|fsck: Xyndrome_lapt: your goal should be to load the status on-demand based on the alt value of the area
17:18 --- serio__ is now known as serio
17:18  Xyndrome_lapt: yes, I know:) So guess I'll have to start reading somewhere, thank you for the pointers:)
17:19  serio: you would think if you call bind with the same event it would overwrite the previous.
17:19  serio: cuz like, you wouldn't be able to pass two 'onrollover' events to something with straight js

17:46  ajpiano: nvictor: i don't know why you would pick this asinine way of doing it
17:46  ajpiano: also $_frm was already a jquery object
17:46  nvictor: ajpiano: well the idea is the following
17:46  nvictor: i have a page of classifieds ads
17:46  ajpiano: and if you are creating a new form on every click then you need to destroy and remove the dialog whnever the diialog is closed etc
17:47  nvictor: and reply button...
17:47  nvictor: ajpiano: what do you mean?
17:47  ScottO_: filtering the checked fields would only return the checked fields, im tryig to highlight when a field is not checked
17:47  ScottO_: but one of the radio buttons is always checked

17:49  danheberden: ajpiano: i send a request to teh server to build the html
17:50  danheberden: and then have it return the html it builds and put that as html
17:50  danheberden: it's uber fast and efficient
17:50  danheberden: Server.createElement('li')
17:50  danheberden: you wait for a while
17:50  danheberden: then you get '<li></li>' back
17:50  nvictor: ajpiano: ok :)
17:51  ajpiano: i send a request to the server, it passes back xml, then i transform the xml into a js object on the client side, then i pass the stringified object back to the server ,it builds the html, and sends back another json object with one key, and the value is the string of html
17:51  ajpiano: it's SUPER PERFORMANT

17:54  unfo-: btw: I was asking for help why an alert() would cause webkit transitions to work and without alert() they would fail ( on the android's native browser): I found out this was a specific bug with Nexus One -- works just fine with Samsung's Android... just in case someone here stumbles upon a similar problem using jQTouch or something else
17:55  erichynds: unfo-, alert() is giving your code time to work
17:55  danheberden: http://gyazo.com/b70c00704f5b9cfac1701fa091bce225.png
17:55  l4rk: wouldn't the alert stop the js thread execution?
17:55  unfo-: erichynds, yeah, but i tried a similar length blocking while() loop and it didn't help
17:56  Hierofant: okay let me ask a different way.  What's the string version of .has()?
17:56  l4rk: :has?
17:56  unfo-: erichynds, i tried several diff "sleep" times to no avail
17:56  l4rk: read the docs
17:56  Hierofant: I thought there was a .contains() but I was wrong :(
17:56  danheberden: l4rk - yeah, but the delay of user interaction/event firing will sometimes give it enough time
17:56  unfo-: erichynds, but on the samsung android it works exactly in the same manner as iphone4 safari.
17:56  erichynds: unfo-, try putting it in a setTimeout to force it to run async
17:57  unfo-: erichynds, tried, not working
17:57  erichynds: hm
17:57  l4rk: danheberden: i've seen it happen, just don't understand why
17:57  Hierofant: l4rk - I don't want to check for an HTML tag, I want to check for a string, like if the <p> contains "Hello world"
17:57  unfo-: erichynds, but if it is a vendor-specific bug i am not going to tackle it

18:10  ajpiano: you don't need to select it with jquery
18:10  Hierofant: But whats the use of objects if you can't read their contents?
18:11  Hierofant: I do if I want to use contains() which so far is the only way I know to read the values in the object array
18:11  RyanD: Looking for a way to take form submissions, perform calculations, then respond by printing a string without the page refreshing. Assume AJAX, use jQuery presently, advice in the right direction?
18:11  ajpiano: you can read their contents key-by-key
18:11  ajpiano: you just shouldn't parse an object like it's a gigantic string
18:12  ajpiano: Hierofant, you need to do a nested loop,
18:12  ajpiano: to loop through navigator.plugins and then each of the keys in i

18:22  Hierofant: inside the array navigator.plugins, there is the string Quicktime if it's installed.  I want to set a global var = 1 if that string exists
18:22  serio: you're going to have to loop twice it looks like.
18:22  pifantastic: for the love of god use a boolean, dont use 1

18:24  Hierofant: okay I'll use a boolean
18:24  Hierofant: I get confused about true vs "true" and == vs === tho
18:24  Hierofant: 1 always works
18:25  m4dv0y: hello?
18:25  pifantastic: m4dv0y: You need to do this via Ajax?
18:25  serio: Hierofant, you can't just look for 'Quicktime' by the way
18:25  m4dv0y: i think so
18:26  serio: because like, there's Quicktime image too

18:35  Hierofant: serio - thanks man, I see now I was missing keys/nodes, and your method of reading description as well.  Much appreciated!

18:40  ajpiano: webspiderch, you have to learn how to read the docs and apply things for yoursel... http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion
18:40  jdummy_: .flamethrower() isn't working.  Didn't try .nuke(), not sure that's safe
18:40  Brodingo: oh man, dang
18:40  jdummy_: my understanding is limited, so if what I'm asking doesn't make sense, please correct me
18:40  webspiderch: yeaa.. it works...
18:40  pifantastic: acdameli: I think {{= object.property}} looks weird
18:40  webspiderch: thanks ajpiano.. you save me long time to search in many place ( already done )
18:40  jdummy_: when I grab a collection of DOM nodes as a jQuery object, it must use some amount of memory... right?   so if I have a large datagrid style app and I'm manipulating rows, memory usage could get out of hand unless I'm doing some sort of garbage collection
18:40  jdummy_: how is that usually handled?

19:13  Hierofant: serio - absolutely, but when my client sends me a video of the website not functioning because the video wont play, the professional solution is at least telling the user to install quicktime.
19:13  SingAlong: can I set the step by which to increment or decrement during animation? the animate page in the docs only says about the step callback.
19:13  SingAlong: I'm animating opacity (cant use fadeIn and fadeOut for some reason)
19:13  Hierofant: as opposed to what has been happening... shadowbox plugin freaking out
19:13  mathi: hi
19:14  Brodingo: sup
19:14  mathi: how do I remove the options in a select element ?
19:14  pifantastic: SingAlong: you can usually use syntax like: "+=10"
19:14  danheberden: find them and remove them
19:15  danheberden: $('#yourSelect option.classMaybeOfItWhoKnows').remove()
19:15  SingAlong: pifantastic: but how can I limit it to a particular value? I'm incrementing from 0.0 to 1.0 so and I'll need to increment by a value like 0.5
19:15  SingAlong: pifantastic: sorry 0.05
19:15  pifantastic: SingAlong: opacity?
19:15  SingAlong: pifantastic: ya
19:15  mathi: thanks buddy
19:15  pifantastic: and why do you need it in discrete steps as opposed to a duration?
19:15  serio: Hierofant, I disagree, the professional solution would be to use a video plugin method that's more widely supported
19:15  serio: Like, flash for instance.
19:15  SingAlong: pifantastic: ya thats fine too.
19:16  pifantastic: $("ele").animate({ opacity: "1.0"}, 500);
19:16  Hierofant: serio - yes, but flash doesn't work on iphone or ipad.
19:16  SingAlong: pifantastic: thanks!
19:16  pifantastic: $("ele").animate({ opacity: "0.05"}, 500);
19:17  Hierofant: So for maximum accessibility, nobody should use Flash.
19:17  SingAlong: pifantastic: the doc pages listed {'opacity': "toggle"}. does that work too?
19:17  serio: using it for video is the same as using quicktime
19:17  SingAlong: (if used along with the duration)
19:17  pifantastic: SingAlong: if the doc pages mention it I bet it does :)
19:17  serio: accessibility isn't an issue
19:17 --- gerred_ is now known as gerred
19:18  serio: I don't think google bots and screen readers can go inside a quicktime movie and tell a blind person what's up
19:18  sean`: no
19:18  Hierofant: serio I meant device accessibility, not handi-capable
19:18  sean`: his/her VOLUME BUTTON does that
19:18  serio: "scene 1, dude picks up coffee cup"
19:18  SingAlong: serio: ROFL
19:18  sean`: and there is no such thing as blind pepole
19:19  pifantastic: only blind hearts
19:19  Hierofant: Apparently, you can jailbreak iphones now to load Flash web pages... But that's assuming a lot of users
19:19  sean`: They just have their eyes rolled backwords
19:19  sean`: wards*
19:19  ajpiano: zemel: this works fine in ie8 http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/3KZcj/
19:19  SingAlong: sean`: there's ARIA in the HTML5 spec. you might want to look it up if you want your site to be accessible by differently abled people :)
19:19  serio: using quicktime is analogous to using .wmv
19:19  sean`: SingAlong, thanks, I did not nkow about aria
19:19  serio: it's archaic, I never install quicktime
19:20  Hierofant: I prefer the term, "Differently Crippled People"
19:20  sean`: /sarcastic typing
19:20  SingAlong: sean`: I didn't too, until a few days back when a guy from Opera gave a talk about it at an HTML5 event
19:20  serio: ARIA requirements eh?
19:20  serio: fun topic
19:20  sean`: Aria stupid?
19:20  sean`: pronounce that
19:20  serio: :/
19:21  SingAlong: Hierofant: I just like to respect them for what they are capable of rather than do it the other way :)
19:21  sean`: SingAlong, aria has been out there quite a while
19:21  SingAlong: serio: ya the name sounds funny
19:21  SingAlong: sean`: agree! but it's taking shape along with the HTML5 spec.
19:21  SingAlong: sean`: right now it's sort of stable since most browsers support atleast a subset of it.
19:22  Hierofant: SingAlong why play nice?  Everybody's fucked, just in different ways.
19:22 --- patrickgamer1 is now known as patrickgamer
19:22  SingAlong: Hierofant: now that's a line I'll vote for :D
19:22  Hierofant: I, for example, have all five senses and four limbs, but I'm insane
19:22 * SingAlong garlands Hierofant
19:22  Hierofant: so a sane guy with 3 limbs is probably better off
19:23  SingAlong: Hierofant: I, for example have all five senses and 4 limbs, but I've been a loser all my life
19:23  Hierofant: really?
19:23  Hierofant: how long is your life so far?
19:23  SingAlong: Hierofant: ya. but i'm only 21. so I hope that doesnt continue.
19:23  SingAlong: :P
19:23  Hierofant: Have you been continually losing throught those 21 years?  I think not
19:24  zemel: ajpiano: It's true. But type "jquery append IE8" in Google... I'm not alone... x|
19:24  SingAlong: Hierofant: funny part, that HTML5 event was sponsored by Microsoft. A guy from MS gave a keynote talk and he got trashed on twitter for that. (he even said "i know a lot of you guys use IE")
19:24  Hierofant: haa.
19:25  Hierofant: Well MS is making the big push to be standards-compliant on IE9
19:25  SingAlong: IE-9 has the best privacy features for geo-location. It just doesn't support it :P
19:25  Hierofant: if it supported it, it wouldn't be secure.
19:25  SingAlong: Hierofant: it seems that the developer tools are really good in IE-9. Some guy who's used it told me abt it. No jokes
19:25  Hierofant: That's how MS achieves security:  vaporware
19:26  serio: and what's quicktime?
19:26  Hierofant: Have you seen the charts?
19:26  SingAlong: Hierofant: what charts?
19:26  ajpiano: zemel: yes, i realise that, but that is not the same as an actual bug report or a concrete failing issue, i've been doing this type of thing for 2 and change years,
19:26  serio: Apple does the same shit with their products,
19:26  ajpiano: and if i can't duplicate your error
19:26  cablehead: no one knows how to get a newly loaded snippet of js to run, when loading external pages, with jquery mobile?
19:26  ajpiano: then no amount of reading about other people's sorrow
19:26  ajpiano: is going to change that
19:26  Hierofant: SingAlong MS has been publishing charts of all the things IE9 supports from a standards perspective, and comparing them with other browsers
19:27  SingAlong: Hierofant: FF4's developer toolbar is simple. i love it. but i miss console.debug() i can't know the line numbers without that.
19:27  Hierofant: IE9 looks to be the most standards-compliant browser ever when it comes out
19:28  SingAlong: Hierofant: ya that MS guy was asked a question "why do organisations still use IE-6. why dont you push them to upgrade to IE-8 or 9?"
19:28  SingAlong: and he replied that "IE-6 is used coz it's secure and simple"
19:29  SingAlong: Hierofant: IE-9 still has some css3 issues. you cant set border radius and shadow at the same time.
19:29  zemel: ajpiano: Well, the bug is happen to me... I'm really don't know why... Anyway, thank you for you help!
19:29  webguy024: zemel I made a test case for you - tell me if errors. -> http://jsfiddle.net/uQ5DR/
19:30  SingAlong: Hierofant: it seems that they wont release IE8 or 9 for WinXp coz they want organisations to upgrade to Vista or Win7. which implies that organisations will still use IE6 :P
19:31  SingAlong: Hierofant: it seems that they wont release IE8 or 9 for WinXp coz they want organisations to upgrade to Vista or Win7. which implies that organisations will still use IE6 :P
19:31  zemel: webguy: That works... But, in my case, when I comment all calls to append() function, the page works...
19:31  serio: that makes sense
19:31  webguy024: ajpiano: I powered down 5 yayquery podcasts yesterday and now that damn theme song has been stuck in my head ever since..heh
19:31  Hierofant: SingAlong thats a bummer
19:32  ajpiano: webguy024 hell yeah, sorry about that :D
19:32  serio: I still use my 486 Dx40 with windows 95 and ie 5.5
19:32  Hierofant: SingAlong I think you're wrong there, tho
19:32  SingAlong: Hierofant: worst part... everyone in the audience was either running linux or had a Mac.
19:32  Hierofant: hang on lemme find url
19:32  webguy024: also there was a song in 4 (ep3) I believe that was about refactoring code - do you have a link to that somewhere? My wife would like to hear that one :)
19:33  ajpiano: webguy024 yeah 1 sec
19:33  devinrolsen: 5 days guys, 5 days at trying to figure out why this ajax script works in every browser but IE.. http://pastebin.com/LC8rd9aj     Fiddler and Charles says its not even sending the request in IE
19:33  SingAlong: Hierofant: I had been to android developer lab a couple weeks back and a guy from Bell announced an iPad contest :D
19:33  devinrolsen: my error alert for client side alerts out NULL in IE
19:33  devinrolsen: just no reason for this
19:33  kojiro: Is there any way to use jquery on the contents of an <object> element whose data url is in the same origin as the parent?
19:33  webguy024: zemel: can you edit the jsfiddle so that it does not work for you? Hit update and send us the new link.
19:34  ajpiano: devinrolsen, i really don't think it knows what the hell to do with that query string
19:34  ajpiano: cause it's not a valid query string, but it's also not an object.
19:34  Hierofant: SingAlong - 1) http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx  <--- you can get IE8 for XP now.   2) haha @ iPad contest
19:34  devinrolsen: ajpiano could you show me the correct way to write that string
19:34  devinrolsen: cuase I have tried hundres of times
19:34  ajpiano: it depends on how you want to send it
19:34  devinrolsen: json
19:34  ajpiano: and what would the actual name of the parameter be ?
19:34  ajpiano: in the query string
19:35  ajpiano: "json" ?
19:35 --- ezra-g|afk is now known as ezra-g
19:35  zemel: webguy: In jsfiffle it's fine. But for me (& all people you can see typeing "jquery append IE8" on Google), unfortunately not...
19:35  temp01: umm jsfiffle
19:35  Hierofant: zemel are you on jsfiffle using IE8!?
19:36  zemel: Hierofant: Yeap...
19:36  Hierofant: then it should work right?
19:36  devinrolsen: I have no idea, all I know is that the server side script is waiting for LocationUrl and ContentID values
19:36  zemel: Hierofant: Yes
19:36 +dabear_: hi people
19:36  Hierofant: zemel have you tried making your own barebones page testing it, then adding to it?
19:36 +dabear_: if I have an image and some text to the left of it
19:36  devinrolsen: I agree about the way the string was written ajpiano, however to no avail over 5 days of trying to write it out correct (from net examples)
19:37  zemel: Hierofant: But type "jquery append IE8" in Google... It's my problem too...
19:37  devinrolsen: if I change one little thing in there it fails across all browsers
19:37 +dabear_: how can I make text overflow into the empty portions of a picture?
19:37  devinrolsen: leave it the way it is and fails in only IE
19:37  ajpiano: devinrolsen: if you actually want to send a JSON encoded string with those values, i would do http://pastebin.com/BZ7bb00M
19:37 +dabear_: http://skitch.com/bjorninge/dh1cr/bestillingsskjema-a-pressen
19:37  ajpiano: devinrolsen, i assume you've tried http://pastebin.com/Qy0dpFCm and it's not what you're looking for?
19:37  Hierofant: zemel - I don't know jackshit about jquery, ask anyone here :)  but if it works in fiddle, have you tried copying the fiddle code over to a new page and running it?
19:37 +dabear_: there's a picture with a lot of transparency
19:37  zemel: Hierofant: Let me try
19:38  devinrolsen: yes to that second link ajpiano
19:38 * Hierofant has ghetto dev skills
19:38  devinrolsen: let me try that first one.. I really appreciate this man.. just been driving me nuts
19:38  ajpiano: zemel: if you want to figure out what the issue is, you need to dig deeper, figure out if your DOCTYPE is having an effect, etc
19:38  ajpiano: zemel: the fact that "other people had the problem, check on google" doesn't help us solve it nor does it really offer any beneficial information
19:39  webguy024: zemel: I suggest you make a test case and put it online so we can see the code. We are happy to help, but you have to make it accessible to us.
19:39  zemel: ajpiano: Yes, off course. I'm point this just to show I'm not crazy  =P
19:40  ajpiano: webguy024: http://music.thewikies.com/jonneal/yayquery/Jonathan_Neal_-_yayQuery_-_09_-_The_Would_You_Please_Update_Your_Code_Song.html
19:40  devinrolsen: :( ajpiano still fails to send the request in IE
19:40  devinrolsen: and client error still alerts null
19:40  webguy024: thx ajpiano
19:40  zemel: webguy ajpiano I know all you guys are willing to help... But the project it's so complex to put on fiddle... -_-
19:41  ajpiano: zemel: then i would guess that the issue is somehow stemming from one of those complexities, not "append doesn't work on IE8"
19:41  ajpiano: because we all know that append does in fact work on ie8
19:42  zemel: ajpiano: Maybe... I'm discard this! But, when I comment all calls to append(), the rest of page works!
19:42  temp01: invalid html?
19:42  zemel: ajpiano: I'ts sad...
19:42  zemel: ajpiano: * not discard this
19:43  ajpiano: he says it blows up for him with $("body").append("<div id='modal'></div>") temp01..
19:43  danheberden: nothing like some blow
19:43  Hierofant: zemel did your test page with fiddle code work on IE?
19:43  ajpiano: zemel: well, that isn't really illuminating anything... it breaks when i do [a thing that i need to do], but when i [don't do that thing], it [doesn't break]
19:44  zemel: Hierofant: Yes... Works in IE8...
19:44  Hierofant: zemel - SO SLOWLY ADD YOUR OTHER CODE INTO IT
19:44  Hierofant: UNTIL IT BREAKS
19:44  Hierofant: get it?
19:44  temp01: I GOT IT
19:45  zemel: Hierofant: So man... Look: when I remove all the append() code on my scrip, things go on!
19:45  Hierofant: sorry temp01, usually when I repeat myself a third time, I raise my voice.  Your ears were not the intended target
19:45  serio: temp01, DO YOU UNDERSTAND!?
19:45  serio: :)
19:45  zemel: Hierofant: I'm not a crazy man wich just don't like the append() function.... =P
19:45  dddh: hi
19:45  dddh: I've seen a site
19:45  temp01: serio: no, do you!?
19:45  ThinkingMan: Hi guys, long time programmer getting used to the ins and outs of jquery, can't seem to figure out for the life of me how to pass other parameters to a function and can't really find any documentation on what's going on
19:45  Hierofant: zemel yet you still may be leaping to conclusions about your problem that aren't what "google jquery append" are
19:45  dddh: found that it is running with jquery_1.1.1, is it still compatible?
19:46  Hierofant: ?TIAS @ dddh
19:46  bot-t: dddh, Try It And See
19:46  serio: temp01, nope
19:46  serio: I try to solve the problem before I ever comprehend it
19:46  serio: that's my real problem.
19:46  temp01: ThinkingMan: what
19:47  Hierofant: You don't even know the half of it.
19:47  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: by and large you don't need to "pass parameters" to functions,
19:47  zemel: Hierofant: But look the coincidence: the error wich IE8 show me is EXACTLY in the SAME line & colum of this: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-append-elem-method-in-ie8
19:47  dddh: Hierofant: that site works and I just wanted to modify some
19:47  ThinkingMan: I see in the .change() documentation an optional eventData parameter, but I can't find anything about that parameter
19:47  ajpiano: zemel: no one cares AT ALL about this nonsene you keep posting about it happening to other people.
19:47  Hierofant: zemel, are you uusing 1.4.3?
19:47  schuyler1d: I just took a look at jquery-tmpl, and had two questions: 1. Are there any plans to do something like a 'strict' version, where not any expression can be run inside the templates?  This would make them far more portable across languages
19:47  zemel: Heimidal: Yes!
19:48  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: see ?bind
19:48  bot-t: ThinkingMan, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
19:48  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: I'm familiar with bind and most of the event handlers, but the documentation makes no reference of what format to use for eventData
19:49  ajpiano: object
19:49  Hierofant: zemel well, I hope you find another way.  good luck.
19:50  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: So maybe I'm doing something wrong syntactically, or maybe reading the documentation wrong then
19:50  ajpiano: ?p
19:50  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
19:50  uvacav: iso some help.. i've got a namespace issue. Im encapsulating some code in an object literal and I can run standard jquery functions fine within that object -- but I can't run any plugins. (for example, from jquery-ui, i get $("someinput").datepicker() is not a function)
19:51  ThinkingMan: the doc for .change() lists that eventdata should be passed first then the eventObject, is that correct?
19:51  ajpiano: wait... ThinkingMan you're talking about supplying an argument that is alread being passed to the function
19:51  temp01: .change(function(){ alert('yay') }) works
19:51  ajpiano: you're not "passing" it yourself"
19:51  ThinkingMan: temp01: ajpiano maybe I'm defining it wrong
19:52  zemel: ajpiano: I say this only to show that the problem is with the native function append() (line 4503-4059 in 1.4.3) in IE8... I enter in that channel looking for help without knowing only THE EXPERTS are helping each other ... Sorry for having a doubt that you consider not relevant, OK?
19:52  ThinkingMan: I've got a js function, function foo(param1, param2)
19:52  ajpiano: change(function(e) { });
19:52  ajpiano: zemel: yah boss, that *totally* made sense.
19:52  danheberden: ajpiano: i'm having trouble with this code sinpper: http://jsfiddle.net/Rqdtg/
19:52  ThinkingMan: the function is used in a lot of places, not just interacting with jQuery
19:53  ajpiano: danheberden: need to not-load mootools uhh
19:53  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: ah yes
19:53  ajpiano: so now we see the issue
19:53  ThinkingMan: but I'd like to write a .change() event that would call that function and pass it the params I need
19:53  zemel: Thank you, guys...
19:53  ajpiano: ThinkingMan, if you do $("foo").change(foo) it doesn't work like you want it to
19:53  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: correct
19:53  MichaelBehan: Has anyone had issues with ease*Bounce animations in IE?
19:54  ajpiano: thatt's cause jquery internally passes the event object as the first argument to the function no matter what
19:54  ajpiano: it doesn't pass your arugments
19:54  ThinkingMan: I know that jquery passes a reference to the calling object itself as the first parameter
19:54  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: tried $("#bar").change(function() {  foo("baz","bat");   });
19:54  ajpiano: ?
19:54  ThinkingMan: soryr, typed those at the same time, not trying to be snippy
19:54  Bertrandio: ThinkingMan: do you want a write a function that sets change or calls it?
19:54  Bertrandio: triggers it,
19:56  ceej: how do i use visibility instead of display for fadeIn?
19:58  danheberden: use animate to change the opacity
19:58  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: syntax error, what am I doing wrong here:
19:58  ThinkingMan:     $('#search_term').change(homeSearch, {foo ("bar", "testvalue")});
19:59  ajpiano: yeah that dtotally is all kinds of wrong
19:59  danheberden: when in doubt, shove a function call in there
19:59  danheberden: lol
19:59  ajpiano: you're trying to ... um... execute a function inside of an object that is completely defined wrong
19:59  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: I love what jquery does, but coming from a C++/PHP background, the syntax and notation makes me want to cry
20:00  ajpiano: it's not jquery, it's javascript
20:00  subsume_: ping
20:00 --- subsume_ is now known as subsume
20:01  subsume: no
20:02  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: OK so I'm not sure what I'm missing but obviously it's some sort of core concept
20:02  ajpiano: yeah,
20:02  ajpiano: like
20:02  ajpiano: you can't pass a function as the second argument to .change
20:02  ajpiano: and you can't pass a function...but wrapping {} around it...
20:03  ThinkingMan: the documentation for .change() says .change( [ eventData ], handler(eventObject) ) which to me says I should be able to pass it two parameters, the first as the data, the second a callback that will receive that data, or am I even getting that wrong?
20:03  ajpiano: yeah, but you're passing a handler, and then... a gigantic mishmosh of syntax
20:03  danheberden: (and if you WERE to pass a function somewhere, functions are objects - so when that says 'handler' - it's not yourFunctionName(whatever) .. it's just yourFunctionName   - just the object )
20:04  darcyclarke: ajpiano .. your blog makes me think about going back to finger painting #amazing !
20:04  danheberden: that or pass an actual function.. function(eventObject) { /* do your shit */ }
20:04  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: aaight I don't want to waste any of your time while I brush up on syntax, mind if I hit you back up in a few?
20:05 --- docgnome is now known as dkerschner
20:05  ajpiano: .change({foo:"bar",baz:"bat",function(e) { homeSearch(ev.data.foo,ev.data.bar);   });
20:05  ajpiano: ThinkingMan ^^
20:05  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: yeah gl
20:06  Hierofant: Is it bad/wrong to addClass, then tie a click() function to the class?
20:07  Hierofant: on a DIV I mean
20:07  ajpiano: it won't work like you expect cause events are bound to elements, they don't magically change events if the classes change
20:07  ajpiano: unless you're using live, not bind
20:07  Hierofant: I know it's invalid markup to link an entire DIV
20:07  Hierofant: I guess because it's block-level
20:08  Hierofant: yeah ajpiano I am usin glive.  My script just stopped working suddenly, after I got the QT part sorted out
20:08  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: now if I'm reading that right, you're passing an object that contains the variables foo and baz which are set to "bar" and "bat" respectively, and that object contains a function that calls my external function, passing it the foo and bar members of it's data object, right?
20:08  Hierofant: I commented out the QT stuff and it's still broken... doesn't append the class to anything
20:08  ajpiano: ThinkingMan: yes
20:08  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: and should those ev.data. be e.data. variables?
20:08  Hierofant: ajpiano : I'm doing this:   $('div.ad-image').addClass('film1').removeClass('film2 film3');
20:09  ajpiano: yeah that was jsut a typo on my part
20:10  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: OK, so that makes sense ... sorta, a few theory questions, the function you defined inline which in turn calls homeSearch, is that a constructor or called automatically or what?
20:11  ajpiano: it's an anonymous function
20:11  danheberden: it's in the function protection program
20:11  ajpiano: the 'this' of that function will be equal to the dom element that the handler is bound to
20:11  ajpiano: it's the same as passing a fucntion reference
20:11  ajpiano: but since you want to be able to pass arugments to the named function, you need the anonymous wrapper
20:12  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: OK, NOW things are starting to click
20:12  ajpiano: woot
20:12  uvacav:  i've got a namespace issue. Im encapsulating some code in an object literal and I can run standard jquery functions fine within that object -- but I can't run any plugins. (for example, from jquery-ui, i get $("someinput").datepicker() is not a function)
20:14  ThinkingMan: ajpiano: OK now I'm gonna go hit the sandbox for a while and play with this stuff, big thanks for all your help, you've been super helpful
20:14  JenniferB: hi folks... i have a jQuery.find('form').each ( .. ) ... I am trying to loop through them using a while loop .. while (i < forms.length) { jQuery( forms[i++])   )  but this is somehow getting me the same darn form element and going through all ...
20:14  ajpiano: np ThinkingMan, good luck
20:14  danheberden: ThinkingMan: they added anonymous functions to php 5.3
20:14  RyanD: :-|.
20:14  JenniferB: what am I doing wrong ?
20:14  danheberden: so you can use that knowledge in your server side stuff too :)
20:14  ajpiano: JenniferB, why are you using a while loop to iterate a jquery object
20:14  ajpiano: unless you have a very specific performance concern it's kind of pointless to do that
20:15  JenniferB: ajpiano: i have my reasons.. I think
20:15  danheberden: ?p @ uvacav
20:15  bot-t: uvacav, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
20:15  JenniferB: the each is going through a max of 100 elements
20:15  ThinkingMan: danheberden: Cut my teeth in C++, most of the concepts I'm familiar with, it's just a little awkward switching from "back end" to "interface" programming, both terms I loathe
20:15  ajpiano: right.....
20:15  xckpd7: question: for jQuery UI Draggables... people usually have that little grippy textured thing... can anyone think of where I would find something like that?
20:16  danheberden: ThinkingMan: it's a shift to get used to prototypal programming
20:16  JenniferB: i wanted to try it out with a loop to see if I get a a different behaviour but now I am getting a different bug
20:16  ajpiano: that doesn't sound ilke a good reason to me
20:16  ajpiano: xckpd7, a handle icon? there are some in the jquery ui themeroller icons
20:16  JenniferB: how do I go through found elements using a while loop ?
20:16 --- dkerschner is now known as docgnome
20:16  xckpd7: ajpiano: kind of like this: http://www.jfreeman.com/images/grip-x_texture.jpg
20:17  ajpiano: JenniferB WHY go through found elements with a while loop
20:17  xckpd7: ajpiano: ok I see now: thanks
20:17  serio: xckpd7, you can use any style you want
20:17  JenniferB: ajpiano: thats not relevant.. and thats not the question.. if i wanted other ways I would have asked
20:18  ThinkingMan: danheberden: Definitely, the way I explained it to one of the other devs here is that I'm much more comfortable reading/manipulating the actual code that MAKES jquery than I am jquery code
20:18 --- archa1c is now known as silo
20:18  ajpiano: it's relevant to me.
20:18  serio: you could make a tile graphic for your own "little grippy textured thing"
20:18  danheberden: xckpd7: you couuld use a &#926;
20:18  ajpiano: if you are using non-standard looping methods to iterate through a jquery method
20:18  ajpiano: you should be able to write those loop cosntructs yourself.
20:18  ajpiano: imo.
20:18  ajpiano: jquery object*
20:18  JenniferB: ajpiano: i told you earlier.. i am experiencing strange behaviour with each and wanted to see if a while would solve it
20:18  ajpiano: you didn't explain the strange behaviour
20:19  serio: ajpiano, essentially: why are you using jQuery if you're doing that?
20:19  ThinkingMan: aaight, time for a beer, thanks for all the help, cheers!
20:19  JenniferB: var forms = jquery('form') ... while(i < forms.length) { jQuery(forms[i++]) } ??
20:20  MichaelBehan: $('form').each( function () {  });
20:20  JenniferB: hehe
20:20  MichaelBehan: is more jquery-ee
20:20  JenniferB: scroll up
20:20  MichaelBehan: ah
20:20  ajpiano: she's having "weird behaviour"
20:20  MichaelBehan: Sorry, didn't read everything
20:20  ajpiano: whatever that means

20:26  alavoil: anyone been doing jquery .append() using jquery mobile?
20:26  uvacav: danheberden: yeah, thats it.. it finds the click function but not functions from any plugins (like datepicker)
20:27  danheberden: uvacav: the datepicker works in the one i sent you
20:27  danheberden: click the input
20:27  danheberden: as long as jquery is avilable to use
20:27  danheberden: it's in the global namespace
20:27  danheberden: it's available to use
20:28  ajpiano: JenniferB: use ++i instead of i++
20:28  uvacav: denheberden: hm.. so it does..... why does it not work in my page.. lemme look and see what im doing differently
20:28  danheberden: uvacav: console log jQuery
20:28  danheberden: just type jQuery; and see what you get
20:29  uvacav: "function()"
20:29  danheberden: sweetness - so you should be alright
20:29  danheberden: maybe ui isn't in there?
20:29  danheberden: console log jQuery.ui
20:29  danheberden: is it undefined?
20:30  uvacav: Object { version="1.8.4", more...}
20:30  danheberden: sounds like you're good then
20:31  danheberden: (i assume $ and $.ui work as well?)

20:34  ceej: is there a way to re run jquery mobile once i ajax load in some content?
20:34  danheberden: $('div.left div.selected').removeClass('selected')
20:35  danheberden: re-run?
20:36  ceej: yee
20:36  ceej: you know it formats the html adding the css classess etc
20:36  ceej: i want to re run that
20:36  ceej: I tried jQuery('[data-role="page"]').page(); with no luck
20:37  xckpd7: ok so this is the first time I've really considered taking a custom design I've did and using jQuery UI to handle it for me.... what would be the best way to start?
20:38  ceej: i.e. the one on top is when the page loads and the one on the bottom is when I pull the same html in via ajax http://screencast.com/t/EIGmB6lZ42n
20:38  xckpd7: should I just download the demo and start stripping stuff? and should I alter the base css styles or the jQuery UI styles (aren't there two?)
20:38  josh__: thanks danheberden, almost worked :), problem is I have multiple left div containers and that resets them all, I was thinking of something that selected the parent then all divs with the selected class below.
20:40  webguy024: zemel
20:41  uvacav: danheberden: i got it, thanks for your help..  I was calling $(document).ready( LN.onReady() ); instead of $(document).ready(LN.onReady);
20:41  MichaelBehan: has anyone had issues with jQuery UI's bounce easings in IE?
20:42  webguy024: MichaelBehan: I am using bounce easing right now in a project and I haven't noticed any inconsistencies in IE
20:42  MichaelBehan: Hmm
20:42  MichaelBehan: For me easeOutBounce and the quad one don't work in IE. I get the delay of the transition but I only see the 'last frame' where the content appears as if the display was toggle from none to block
20:43  MichaelBehan: s/don't/won't
20:43  serio: you've included the easing.js?
20:44  MichaelBehan: Yes it works in other browsers

20:52  Hierofant: I have a large img w/ a smaller img inside it, and a hover animate script.  When the mouse is over the smaller image, it defocuses the hover.  Is there a way to bypass this?
20:53  ralphholzmann: Hierofant: use the mouseenter and mouseleave events
20:53  LakWork: use enter() and exit() instead of hover()
20:53  ralphholzmann: rather than mousein mouseout
20:53  Hierofant: thanks
20:53  LakWork: enter() and exit() apply to children of the bound element where hover() does not
20:53  Hierofant: perfect!
20:54  ralphholzmann: LakWork are you using some custom API? There's no exit or enter natively in jQuery.
20:55  brian_irish: performance question: is $('div').remove('.hello'); faster than $('.hello').remove(); ?
20:56  schuyler1d: $('div.hello').remove() will be faster
20:56  LakWork: im sorry ralphholzmann needs to be mouseenter() mouseexit()
20:56  LakWork: err mouseleave()

20:57  KeeperOfTheSoul: is there any equivilent to debugging symbols for javascript for use with minified (or equivilent) source?
20:57  Hierofant: Yeah I just figured that oput the hard way in the background.
20:57  LakWork: KeeperOfTheSoul are you using visual studio?
20:58  KeeperOfTheSoul: LakWork: I have visual studio, sure
20:58  LakWork: actually before i elaborate, what do you mean by debugging symbols?
20:58  Hierofant: Hm weird nope, it didn't change it
20:59  macmartine: How would I convert "Thu Oct 28 2010 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PST) {}" to "2010-10-28T00:00:00+00:00" ?
20:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: LakWork: eg, if I have javascript that has been created by something else (eg, minified or packed) it would be a description of the translation between the to
20:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: LakWork: so some sort of debugger (perhaps firebug plugin) could allow stepping through the original source rather than the output
21:00  LakWork: ah i see
21:00  LakWork: hmmm
21:01  Hierofant: LakWork - this isn't a child alas

21:08  Hierofant: LOL Yes.  CSS can in fact conflict with JQuery in unpredictable ways.
21:08  Hierofant: I fixed it
21:08  LakWork: just a note you could chain the two bindings together
21:08  Hierofant: I had to remove :hover stuff from the CSS on those objects
21:08  Hierofant: here, lemme show
21:08  LakWork: $('div.ad-image, div#playBut').mouseenter(function{}).mouseleave(function() {});
21:08  LakWork: ahh
21:09  Hierofant: uh wait no, that didn't break it.
21:09  serio: wtf BBQ
21:09  LakWork: with that syntax jquery won't have to perform the selection twice
21:09  Hierofant: but it fixed it on my end?

21:09  serio: I'm pretty sure my .css file will not break my .js file.
21:10  Hierofant: serio - not sure why, but removing :hover declaration fixed my JS :?
21:10  serio: and the :hover is in your css?
21:10  Hierofant: yeah was
21:10  Hierofant: maybe it was a cache issue.

21:17  LakWork: mmm KeeperOfTheSoul i hear that >.<
21:17  LakWork: YourNameHere sure, create the storage variable outsize of the $.ajax() call
21:18  LakWork: var foo = [] $.ajax(... foo = data;
21:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: LakWork: though narrative has though of that problem, and ensures the line numbers in the generated js match the source js
21:18  YourNameHere: thanks LakWork, I'll try it
21:19  KeeperOfTheSoul: LakWork: which does help, does mean the output isn't so neat, but at least error on line 245 means you can just go to 245 in your source
21:19  LakWork: indeed
21:20  LakWork: would be nice to see a plugin to facilitate that

21:31  JT_DRUP: i have a selector which doesn't work..hierarchy is <div id="dynamidID"><div>bla bla</div><div><embed /></div></div>
21:32  l4rk: badseeds: because those are distinct objects
21:32  l4rk: $(this).selector makes no sense
21:32  l4rk: this isn't a selector
21:32  badseeds: Well, what I'm trying to do is this:
21:32  badseeds: $('#selector').resizable({ alsoResize: $(this).find('.alsoResize') });
21:32  l4rk: change it to $("html").selector :)
21:32  JT_DRUP: i need to get reference to the embed tag
21:32  badseeds: I'm just trying to figure out why it doesn't work..
21:32  l4rk: because your object is already set
21:32  l4rk: you can't access it again unless you do an assignment
21:32  l4rk: aka a variable
21:33  l4rk: also $(this) won't work there
21:33  l4rk: make a reference to $("#selector") first
21:34  l4rk: var selector = $("myselecotr"); myselector.resizable({ alsoResize: myselector.find ...
21:34  badseeds: Yeah, I know, but the selector is actually not #selector, but .selector so it might be alot of divs.
21:34  l4rk: so what
21:34  l4rk: its not storing them in memory
21:34  l4rk: only reference pointers
21:37  mstratman: anyone know offhand how resizable() figures out the width and height "style" attributes it assigns to the wrapper div it adds?
21:37  mstratman: When i call it on an <img>, it sets width/height to 0 on the parent div. Effectively making the img disappear
21:38  badseeds: l4rk: thanks a lot, that worked perfectly :)
21:38  l4rk: np man
21:38  l4rk: mstratman: i'm guessing offsetWidth/Height, but you'd have ot check to be sure
21:38  mstratman: yea, investigating now. Just figured i'd ask in case anyone saw this before and knows offhand
21:38  mstratman: thanks.
21:40  mstratman: looks like this.element.outerWidth() and outerHeight. (have no idea what those are.. but it sounds promising)

21:44  serio: not vim or vi either
21:44  serio: no command line based IDE's either!
21:45  mstratman: aha! outerWidth() and outerHeight() do not work on non-visible items (e.g. in an inactive jqueryui tab).  Think that constitutes a bug or expected behavior?

21:53  mstratman: josh__: without even looking at your code, i can say that if i came across a chained command like that while maintaining code, i'd hunt down the original author and stake them through the heart.
21:53  mstratman: you could probably find a much simpler way to find the element in question.
21:53  josh__: haha :(
21:54  josh__: I'm having trouble because I have multiple div containers and if i delete the class another way, it resets all the buttons
21:55  danheberden: and why the hell would you do two sibling calls like that?
21:55  danheberden: the sibling is still a sibling
21:56  josh__: I was trying to select the siblings within that sibling, maybe I'm not getting how that works...
21:56  danheberden: those would be children then
21:56  Brodingo: um

21:59  espinosam: webguy024 Thank you very much. That helps me out.
21:59  alavoil: webguy: i agree but is jquery mobile not adding in those classes?
22:00  alavoil: webguy: the page source is the same, but the framework adds in the extra styling on page load
22:00  klj613: Hi, im using 'draggable' on a div to be a scroll button for a gallery. I use the move event to move the gallery along with the draggable div. the problem is when i flick the draggable div across the slider fast, the move event is being executed at a dramatically low rate compared to when move the draggable div slowly. how can i counter this?
22:00  webguy024: alavoil: it seems like you are subverting the framework by using append.
22:01  webguy024: klj613: I have not seen this happen with drag, can you make a jsfiddle example?
22:03  alavoil: webguy024: yeah, i guess i thought that was the reason for using the framework (not worrying about styling)

22:05 --- siebo_ is now known as siebo
22:05  webguy024: alavoil: my guess is you are doing it wrong by using append, I suspect there is a builtin method that will apply the right styles.
22:05  webguy024: I could be wrong of course, I have no experience with jquery mobile
22:06  alavoil: webguy024: yeah i think youre right.  the alpha framework was released on monday so im still trying to figure it out
22:06  webguy024: klj613: I'll show you how to use jsfiddle - it is better that way. Next time you need help you won't have to give access to your server.
22:07  klj613: webguy024: ive got 6 javascript files, 5 css files, and then theres the HTML. And I would have to put everything into jsfiddle? :/ lol
22:08  josh__: managed to get it to work with 		$(this).parent().parent().find('div.left div.selected').removeClass('selected'); is this bad???

22:16  dub54: webguy024: where do I add the delay?
22:16  webguy024: klj613: are you viewing the source of the source pane or something? That is what I get when I try to do that. I use jsfiddle all the time - hasn't let me down. I have about 50 test cases that I built already.
22:16  dub54: not sure because it's got the setTimeout()..
22:17  klj613: nm, i just find a alternative to jquery ui draggable div's
22:18  webguy024: klj613: if that is what you want to do - I use draggable div's all the time. But if you want to throw the baby out with the bath water that is your call.
22:19  dna|scab: sorry, stepped away for a bit
22:19  webguy024: dub54 I think you mean setInterval - and basically delay would be used as an alternative to setInterval.
22:19  dna|scab: anyways, i have a problem w/ the jquery ui buttonset
22:19  dna|scab: between jquery ui 1.8.2 and 1.8.5, the using buttonset() on a collection stopped applying ui-corner attributes to first and last button in each object in a collection
22:19  klj613: "viewing the source of the source pane", this is more work than me trying to solve the solution itself. wtf does that mean? also the 'move' event gets called when the draggable div isnt moving anymore! (constraint). if i move it outside of the parent div (where the button stops because its constainted to the parent) the move event is still called
22:19  webguy024: everytime you fade one row out you set the next row to fade with a delay. Delays are setup like doThisFunction().delay(1000);

22:24  bot-t: klj613, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
22:24  eTiger13: dna|scab: look at github and see when/why it was removed
22:25  Hierofant: If anyone uses Ultraedit, know how I can back-tab paragraphs?  I forgot
22:25  klj613: i gave jsfiddle the html snippet, the appropriate javascript. and the css. and it give me a error
22:26  Hierofant: haha okay I just needed the right keywords here
22:26  ner0x: Is it possible to just "move" dom objects?
22:26  Hierofant: '"out-dented"
22:26  webguy024: klj613: sorry man. I use it often and i've only seen that error when trying to view the source of the result pane.
22:26  ajpiano: what's the link to klj613 pastebin
22:26  ner0x: When I do a var myDomObject = $("#selector"); can I remove it from the DOM and add the "myDomObject" to some other object?
22:26  ajpiano: ner0x, myDomObject.appendTo("#someOtherPlace")
22:26  ajpiano: will MOVE the object
22:26  ajpiano: you do not have to remove it yourself first
22:27  ner0x: ajpiano: Interesting.
22:27  webguy024: klj613: but if you could put the offending js code into a pastebin or something then we can take a look at it and get the ball rolling :)
22:29  klj613: just figured out what was causing the problem, its because i use <li> </li> elements in the html. Lol
22:30  Betacommand: can anyone lend a hand to why I cant get http://toolserver.org/~betacommand/AFD.html to sort?
22:30  klj613: now the error doesnt come up with li. now it comes up because of <img>
22:31  ajpiano: Betacommand, cause you're not using a debugger
22:31  ajpiano: 2AFD.html:8Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'tablesorter'
22:31  dna|scab: beyond that, you have two <theads>
22:32  webguy024: klj613: <li> should not defeat draggable :)
22:32  ajpiano: Betacommand, tablesorter is a plugin, you need to include the script for it
22:32  klj613: the <li> is for the gallery list, a list of images which are in-line
22:32  klj613: whenever draggable moves, i move the <ul>
22:33  webguy024: interesting.. I'm going to make a test case on that one :)
22:33  klj613: if i move the draggable fast, it doesnt move the <ul> the same as it moves it when u move the draggable slowly
22:33 --- YourNameHere is now known as Cody
22:35  webguy024: klj613: does it happen here? -> http://jsfiddle.net/KhNBR/
22:35  ajpiano: klj613, you're using jquery mobile, right?
22:35  ajpiano: or did i make that up
22:35 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
22:36  webguy024: ajpiano: i think you are thinking alavoil - he was using jquery mobile. Didn't see klj613 mention mobile.
22:36  klj613: im using normal jquery. and no webguy024 it doesnt happen there. i got images in the list, and the draggable is in a completely different area of the html, i got two containers, scroll and gallery
22:36  ajpiano: oh ok
22:37  alavoil: yes im using jquery mobile
22:37  webguy024: how is it going by the way alavoil ?
22:37  webguy024: klj613: can you modify the html in the jsfiddle so that it matches your scenerio more closely? If we can recreate the error we can fix it :)
22:37  alavoil: webugy024: i found some bug reports about my issue, they are working on fixing it so the style is enriched dynamically
22:38  webguy024: alavoil - so there is no way to 'refresh' the list to reapply the styles?
22:39  alavoil: webguy024: not right now but that is exactly what they are talking about for a fix: http://bit.ly/bz5Pna

22:39  devinrolsen: ajpiano, I think my problems are living much deeper haha... I was tasked with another ajax link thing to .load() a email form into the page... and again IE failed!
22:39  devinrolsen: testing them all out in localhost.. .works fine
22:39  ajpiano: devinrolsen, IE hates invalid markup
22:39  ajpiano: hmm
22:39  alavoil: webguy024: again, the alpha was only released this monday
22:39  devinrolsen: yeah
22:39  devinrolsen: weird right
22:40  thepacmanfan: <ajpiano> devinrolsen, IE hates valid markup    <<<fixed that for ya
22:40  webguy024: alavoil: glad someone is on the bleeding edge, I'm still making up for the years spent learning ActionScript :)
22:41  ajpiano: thepacmanfan, IE barfs when you try to inject malformed markup, whereas other browsers will allow you to do it
22:41  ajpiano: sooo
22:41  alavoil: webguy024: haha
22:41  ajpiano: cheekiness much appreciated
22:41  ajpiano: but inaccruate
22:41  devinrolsen: both the ajax() and load() get stopped exactly at the same spot right when it trys to send something out to IE
22:41  devinrolsen: err out to server side
22:41  devinrolsen: in IE
22:41  devinrolsen: anyways I dont think its something we can fix from jquery side is all I am sayin
22:41  devinrolsen: something evil lives in that server
22:42  devinrolsen: ps. site is ran on Ektron CMS
22:42  thepacmanfan: ajpiano: i do understand that, but IE also tends to ignore obscure CSS properties that every other browser renders.
22:42  devinrolsen: foul markup is unavoidable
22:42  ajpiano: thepacmanfan, right, but everyone knows IE sucks,
22:42  devinrolsen: :O
22:42  devinrolsen: IE is the best
22:42  devinrolsen: thats why everyone uses it
22:42  devinrolsen: right?
22:42  devinrolsen: hehe
22:42  ajpiano: however, the caveats WRT markup issues and load are actually relevant to this discussion
22:43  thepacmanfan: yeah, i'm off-topic. my bad
22:43  ajpiano: it's cool!
22:43  webguy024: ajpiano: following up on one of the yayquery podcasts how do you feel about server side javascript (now that it is about one year later)? Also any recommending reading?
22:44  ajpiano: SSJS?  node is awesome... and i wish i had more time to do cool shit with it
22:44  ajpiano: that is all :)
22:45  jeremyw: Yes it is.
22:46  webguy024: good enough for me - I don't have time either but I'm going to put it in my head anyway :)
22:49  webguy024: one more question off the wall - what framework's should I look into for game development? Coworker is working on a memory game and I'd like to nudge him in a helpful direction :)
22:49  k1ng: someone please recommend me a movie
22:49  webguy024: haha k1ng - where are you getting your movies?
22:49  ajpiano: webguy024, not too informed about that... paul bakaus, guy who initially created jquery ui... he has a company called Dextrose that has an html5 engine called Aves but they just got bought by Zynga
22:50  ajpiano: i don't know if the engine is avail for public consumption
22:50  webguy024: i still recommend the king of kong - one of the best documentaries I have soon in a while.
22:50  webguy024: thanks ajpiano
22:50  k1ng: webguy024, lol... dont ask private q on public
22:50  webguy024: s/soon/seen/
22:50  webguy024: lol
22:52  webguy024: k1ng: ever watched Little Britain? Funny british show -> http://goo.gl/W54C
22:52  dub54: if i say jquery drop down menu what do you say?
22:53  klj613: webguy024: closest i can get it to is http://jsfiddle.net/d6phb/2/ - some stuff may be different compared to whats on my site. but u still can see it moves the gallery slower/faster depending on how fast u moving the draggable div
22:54  webguy024: ahh yes I see what you mean now klj613
22:55  klj613: (:
22:55  webguy024: now we are on the same page :)
22:55  klj613: code abit messy, im always messy with javascript but i do clean it up after i get everything working ;p
22:57  webguy024: my guess - based on actionscript experience is that .move() does not fire everytime the element moves 1px that would be to intense. So in your case you would need to do some simple math to get the distance from the start point and the current point of the scrubber to determine the scroll distance of the images.
22:58  webguy024: however I must suggest slider also -> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
22:59  klj613: does slider fire the move all time? if not its the same. the only other alternative be is using animations to catch up to the new position of draggable div
22:59  klj613: then the speed of gallery wud varie quite abit
23:01  Jonz: can anybody name a really solid well-respected plugin that is efficient?  I want to just skim the source and look for pointers on style and whatnot
23:02  vastak: Jonz, what about jquery-ui plugins?
23:02  ajpiano: Jonz: look at any one of ben alman's plugins
23:02  Jonz: word, i'll check em out, thank you guys
23:04  luciano: i've this doubt
23:04  webguy024: ajpiano: aves looks sweet - hope it goes open source.
23:04  luciano: how can i select the next adjacent from #nombre element
23:04  luciano: <input  type="text" id="nombre" name="nombre" size="100" /><p class="errores"></p>
23:04  ionas: can you recommend jquery based extensible/modifyable richtext editors
23:04  ionas: ?
23:04  luciano: i've tried whith the next() function
23:05  pifantastic: luciano: you mean p.errores?
23:06  luciano: yes, but getting the next  element of ·nombre
23:06  klj613: webguy024: think i can use setInterval ? when the drag starts, until the drag stops. or would that be too intense?
23:06  luciano: $(#nombre).next() didn't work
23:06  pifantastic: $("#nombre").next() will return p.errorers
23:06  webguy024: yeah to intense, my suggestion is to use the slider and use its output (1 to 100) to figure out where the gallery container should scroll to.
23:06  luciano: doesnt work with me
23:07  luciano: and no errors are report
23:07  ambackstrom|fsck: $('#nombre').nextAll('p.errores:first')
23:07  ajpiano: ?p @ luciano

23:08  klj613: ty for all ur help :)
23:08  Jonz: heh, when I asked for a really good plugin I was hoping you wouldn't see lines of code like this:
23:08  Jonz: var that = this
23:08  Jonz: but i guess that's a common practice..
23:08  delinquentme: Hey all im trying to do a jquery / JS "if then" statement to test whether an element is at "top: -8px" OR "top: -500px"  http://pastie.org/1239182 ... b asically id like to test that css value and allow it to swap between those two values
23:08  webguy024: np klj613, I learn with you. I just picked up jquery 2 months ago, came from MooTools and ActionScript.
23:09  pifantastic: delinquentme: use 2 classes
23:09  pifantastic: delinquentme: and then toggle the classes
23:09  luciano: there works fine
23:09  luciano: i didnt know whats problem
23:09  klj613: i've only used jQuery. but i tend to do alot of coding/pratice/learn, then have a break and play games etc.
23:09  luciano: thanks anyway
23:10  pifantastic: luciano: your markup must be different
23:10  klj613: i learn as i create. but with php i tend to read books for security, better patterns, etc.
23:10  klj613: programming, you never stop learning (:
23:10 * pifantastic high fives klj613 
23:10 * webguy024 nods in agreement
23:11 * webguy024 fist pumps into the air

23:14  xckpd7: jQuery UI question: I'm messing with sortables, and each sortable has a dark bottom border and a light top border, which creates a nice effect when they are alone.. but when sorting, the element being sorted, and the placeholder left, it looks sorta weird. It seems I can address the element I'm sorting, but what about that placeholder spot?
23:15 +dabear_: ?ui sortable
23:15  bot-t: dabear_, jQuery UI - Sortable Demos & Documentation - Enable a group of DOM elements to be sortable. Click on and drag an element to a new spot within the list, and the other items will adjust to fit. By default, sortable items share draggable propert... http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
23:16 +dabear_: xckpd7: ui.placeholder - the placeholder (if you defined one)
23:16 +dabear_: from the above link
23:17  pifantastic: ui-sortable-placeholder is the class given to the placeholder
23:18  xckpd7: dabear_: huh? yeah I know the class of it: it's set to visibility: hidden (look at the dom inside of firebug while sorting, you can see it)
23:18 +dabear_: xckpd7: then what's the issue
23:18  mikesten: *bump* jQuery Mobile with Google Maps question... Has anyone tried it? I'm having some odd issues.
23:19  xckpd7: dabear_: I'm trying to style that element.. it's hidden by sortable

23:21  xckpd7: dabear_: everything I'm working with is from the demos, why do I need to paste code...
23:21 +dabear_: you need to explain the issue you're having

23:31  Hierofant: I havent built a table yet
23:32  Hierofant: ah crap nm, undefined :(
23:33  eTiger13: webguy024:  your scroller line in js is missing #
23:33  Vorspire: (BMCouto): a lot of the window.GlobalFn references can be replaced with 'this'
23:34  BMCouto: Vorspire: just replace window.GlobalGn by 'this'?
23:34  eponym: Is anyone familiar with Spritely? I'm attempting to use it to pan a background image for the active item in a list, but I'm having some trouble with it going faster every time the active class changes. I have a minimal example here: http://laserpony.net/pantest/
23:34  BMCouto: and any idea why can't i reach the var there?
23:34  Vorspire: (BMCouto): http://www.jsfiddle.net/WvfM2/2/ - you still have the undefined bug, lets take it from this fiddle
23:34  dub54: does anyone know how to center a superfish menu?

23:36  dub54: eTiger13: i tried the obvious css, as suggested by losing, but that didn't work. seeing as its a jquery menu i thought the someone in here is more likely to know the answer
23:36  BMCouto: Vorspire: any idea why its undefined?
23:36 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
23:36  eponym: dub54: do you have an example I could look at?
23:37  dub54: nvm, http://www.tightcss.com/menus/centered_superfish.html
23:37  paul_irish: eTiger13: ill be in tokyo
23:37  Vorspire: (BMCouto): my best guess would be because window.GlobalFn.URLs is defined as a function and you try to set variables for it (basepath, etc) - I think window.GlobalFn.URLs should be an Object with a sub0-function to get the json data
23:38  eTiger13: paul_irish:  whoa, thats far
23:38  paul_irish: 67.218.106.57a
23:38  paul_irish: uh

23:38  snover: 67.218.106.57 to you too!
23:40  pifantastic: eponym: Why do you call pan again in the ul>li click handler?
23:40  pifantastic: eponym: why not call .spStop/Start?
23:41  eponym: pifantastic: I tried spStop/spStart but I couldn't get that to work.
23:42  pifantastic: I think its because you are continuously calling pan()
23:42  pifantastic: and the effects are stacking
23:42  eponym: pifantastic: I agree. But I'm not sure how to get the effect I want because once the active element changes, the pan won't resume.
23:43  pifantastic: eponym: I think maybe you need to set the pan() on each li at most once
23:43 --- Dantman is now known as Dantman|afk
23:44  pifantastic: eponym: or maybe there is a method to remove the pan() before you re add it
23:44  eponym: pifantastic: Yeah, I only want the .active background to pan.
23:45  MatthewG: Hierofant: hm, looked into wurlf?
23:45  MatthewG: I think that was it
23:45  eponym: pifantastic: I'm not sure that there is a method for removing pan(). I'll double check.
23:45  pifantastic: eponym: so you need to make sure you call pan() on each li only once
23:45  Hierofant: MatthewG no, for detection?
23:46  pifantastic: eponym: its kind of a hack but you could call pan() and the immediately call stop() and then call start() when you add the .active class
23:46  pifantastic: I imagine there is a better way but I dont know spritely
23:46  MatthewG: Hierofant: http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ yup
23:46  Vorspire: (BMCouto): http://www.jsfiddle.net/WvfM2/6/
23:47  paul_irish: MatthewG: have you used it
23:47  Hierofant: MatthewG thanks, but that's more than I need
23:47  Vorspire: (BMCouto): that code should work in theory, but jsfiddle obviously won't find the json call you're making
23:47  BMCouto: Vorspire: let me check
23:47  MatthewG: paul_irish: I believe a module I'm using uses it
23:47  eponym: pifantastic: Aha, that helped a lot, I think I've got it now.
23:47  MatthewG: Hierofant: hm, there are ways to detect if the screen is less than 500px wide and then redirect, I think
23:48  BMCouto: Vorspire: did you give me the right link? it doesnt work and it looks the same
23:49  BMCouto: Vorspire: oh i see the difference, but i still get undefined
23:50  Vorspire: (BMCouto): when I run the code, i get the window.GlobalFn Object in console and an error about the local json call, seems to be working
23:50  Vorspire: http://www.jsfiddle.net/WvfM2/6/
23:51  Hierofant: YAY think I just finished with this
23:51  Vorspire: (BMCouto): the best thing to do with this is to make it a plugin that just initializes onLoad and can be accessed by DOM Ready
23:52 * Hierofant possibly just finalized a website he's been on since April :)
23:52  BMCouto: Vorspire: not its null
