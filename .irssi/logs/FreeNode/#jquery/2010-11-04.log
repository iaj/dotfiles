08:41  dilvie: CuDi: Is it possible some of those characters might be user generated inputs (like, control / decorative chars around names?)
08:41 +CuDi: oh they're the weird type of quotes
08:42 +CuDi: “
08:42 +CuDi: MTV’s “Jersey Shore,”
08:42 +CuDi: shows up as : MTVâ€™s â€œJersey Shore,â€
08:42  dilvie: strip them and call it good.
08:42 +CuDi: LOL
08:42 +CuDi: what about base64_decode or something
08:42  dominikl: hi guys, can anyone help me with a little jQuery mobile problem? it's about re-rendering a button: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/howto-refresh-re-render-a-button .... THX in advance for any help / idea!
08:43  dilvie: CuDi: will that work? I was just thinking maybe a regex replace would work. =)
08:43 +CuDi: didnt work nah.
08:43 +CuDi: its got to be an encoding issue though
08:44  beasty_: Yawn
08:44 +CuDi: json
08:45  beasty_: bah
08:45 +CuDi: no luck
08:45  beasty_: why does this zend studio needs to hang all the time
08:45  mekwall: CuDi, their quotes aren't weird :) they are actually what they should be.
08:45 +CuDi: yea i know
08:46 +CuDi: but they're nt showing up properly when i use facebook api to read them
08:46 +CuDi: so theres got to be an encoding mixup somewhere
08:46  mekwall: and you are using UTF-8 I presume?
08:46 +CuDi: not sure dude
08:46  mekwall: what do the headers say?
08:46 +CuDi: my php file is ANSI
08:47  dilvie: CuDi: s = s.replace(/[\u2018|\u2019|\u201A]/g, "\'");
08:47  mekwall: ah :D
08:47  juha_: beasty_: my zend studio is lagging only when it's indexing stuff..
08:47 +CuDi: il switch it to utf-8 see if that works
08:47  mekwall: CuDi, you might want to switch to UTF-8 without BOM
08:47  dilvie: s = s.replace(/[\u201C|\u201D|\u201E]/g, "\"");
08:47 +CuDi: hangtight
08:47  mekwall: using UTF-8 everywhere really help you sleep at night
08:47 +CuDi: LOL
08:47 +CuDi: yea changed to utf-8 but no change
08:47 +CuDi: http://meels.uni.cc/fb/
08:47  mekwall: so what do the headers say?
08:47  juha_: mekwall: could it help me to get some sleep now?
08:48  dilvie: CuDi: s = s.replace(/[\u201C|\u201D|\u201E]/g, "\""); <-- seriously. Do it.
08:48  mekwall: CuDi, response from the API that is
08:48 +CuDi: response from the API how do i check that
08:48  mekwall: juha_: sure, just start reading the RFC on UTF-8 and you'll be sleeping within 10 minutes
08:48  dilvie: where s = your crapped up string.
08:49  juha_: mekwall: not fast enough :(
08:49  dilvie: I should have been sleeping hours ago.
08:49  mekwall: juha_: depends on how fast you can read :D
08:49  mekwall: CuDi, show me ze code :P
08:49  juha_: mekwall: well, i'm just littlebit drunk atm, so quite slow
08:50  dilvie: CuDi: did you try the regex replace?
08:50  mekwall: juha_: that's great mate ;)
08:50 +CuDi: regex replace nah not yet
08:50  mekwall: juha_: I thought it was morning in Finland now as well haha
08:50 +CuDi: i wanna find the root of the problem man
08:50  mekwall: yeah, you shouldn't go around a problem with regexp
08:50  mekwall: that's a real bad habit
08:50  mekwall: and it will eventually get you fired
08:50  juha_: mekwall: well, that's no excuse for not being drunk
08:50  mekwall: :D
08:51  mekwall: juha_: true... I guess you are just doing what finns do
08:51  juha_: mekwall: being complete dicks? yeah! i'm the champion
08:51 +CuDi: lol
08:51  mekwall: juha_: tell that to the russians!
08:52  philk__: are there any memory leaks known when removing DOM elements in IE? It seems the memory increases over the time when one remove() elements
08:52  melc: is there any way to handle the result of autocomplete manually? i need to count the number of rows that autocomplete found
08:53  dilvie: CuDi / mekwall: I believe the root of the problem is that you're dealing with user-generated content from Facebook, and people are copying and pasting from MS Word and similar applications, and Facebook isn't bothering to do that regex replace I told you to do.
08:53  sean`: hey
08:53  sean`: kid CuDi
08:53  dilvie: CuDi / mekwall: If that's the case, your character encoding solutions are not going to make a difference.
08:53 +CuDi: hm
08:53  sean`: oi juha_
08:53 +CuDi: dilvie you could be right
08:54 +CuDi: but then why does it show up fine in facebook
08:54 +CuDi: weird right
08:54  mekwall: I'm pretty sure that facebook take all kinds of formatting actions on the content
08:54  dilvie: CuDi: probably because they do their replacements on the display side in JavaScript, and not on the input saving side.
08:54  mekwall: it's probably saving them loads of money in db storage costs :)
08:54 +CuDi: lool
08:55 +CuDi: you reckon
08:56  dilvie: they might also do replacement in their php views - which also wouldn't effect their web service streams.
08:57 +CuDi: hmm
08:58  dilvie: I should be sleeping. Goodnight!
08:58 +CuDi: cya mate
08:59  mekwall: doing replacements in views or in javascript doesn't make any sense to me
08:59  mekwall: it's common practice to do replacements before storage
09:01 +CuDi: true
09:02 +CuDi: il see if i can get a response out of the#facebook people
09:02 +CuDi: no-one even active atm
09:04  mekwall: CuDi, well... you should be able to take a look at the headers
09:04  mekwall: if you can do a request manually and then check the response
09:08 +CuDi: i needa find a php function to check the headers
09:09  Jarda: CuDi: isset() and $_SERVER
09:09  Jarda: etv
09:09  Jarda: etc
09:09 +CuDi: what
09:10 +CuDi: bro the encoding type of the string wats that got to do with the return type of an API variable lol
09:10  mekwall: CuDi, I haven't really fooled around with the Facebook API ... but I'm pretty sure you should be able to get them out of the response or something
09:10 +CuDi: string* server*
09:30  Confused: Hi - I need some help with treeTable plugin - anybody here using it? http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-plugins/treeTable/doc/index.html
09:31  mekwall: ?ask @ Confused
09:31  bot-t: Confused, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
09:32  Confused: ok, i've got treeTable expanding and collapsing table rows as shown in the examples - but what i want to do is add a button on the page called 'Expand all rows'/Collapse all rows
09:33  Confused: I'm not sure how to get all rows to expand/collapse in a single action
09:34  mekwall: Confused, I guess you could trigger the click action for the handlers
09:35  mekwall: Confused, $('#table-id tr.collapsed').click();
09:35  Confused: mekwall - I will try it now
09:35  mekwall: Confused, however... I'm not sure that's the right way to do it, but it should at least work :)
09:40  Confused: mekwall - can you look at this plz? http://pastie.org/1271716
09:41  mekwall: Confused, that doesn't work?
09:41  sean`: http://jsfiddle.net/mJRGe/
09:41  sean`: FREE CODE
09:41  sean`: Get it while it's hot
09:41  Confused: no, nothing happens at all, no errors either...
09:41  Confused: let me check again
09:41  Confused: do i need to use each() against tr.collapsed ?
09:42  mekwall: nope
09:42  Confused: ok leave it with for a bit
09:42  mekwall: Confused, can you try and set up a test case @ jsfiddle.net ?
09:42  Confused: ok, will do

09:56  matricks: I am trying to use some variable for text dialog buttons
09:56  matricks: but I gave the name of variable
09:56  matricks: not it value
09:58  matricks: I declar var okButton="OK";

09:58  bot-t: nlogax: OK

09:58  wliao: does anyone know what "$( "<span></span>" )" means?
09:59  wliao: im trying to change the accordion of jquery UI.
09:59  Adry: I am trying to use validate jquery plugin, but can't figure out how to set it up so that the user needs to enter either his email address OR his telephone number. I know how to setup required, I know how to set up non required, but not 'at least one required, both ok'.
09:59  tngraessler: @wliao: you create a new dom node, which is not yet assigned
10:00  Adry: Is validate the answer or should I just write a couple of lines of code by hand?
10:00  nlogax: matricks: js doesn't let you do that in object literals, afaik
10:00 --- Guest96052 is now known as roberm
10:02  nlogax: matricks: but you can create the object in advance, and do thatObj[okButton] = function() ...
10:02  nlogax: matricks: and then use it
10:02  kikita: Hi guys
10:02  tngraessler: hi
10:02  matricks: I don't understand
10:02  matricks: but I will try

10:03  kikita: (I need u : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089046/how-to-recover-checkboxes-after-a-cloned-div-with-jquery-php)
10:03  nlogax: matricks: anObj.foo and anObj["foo"] is the same thing, so to set a property with a name contained in a variable, you can do anObj[thevar] = something
10:04  espen_mn: I have a jquery script that "changes css", in other words, clicking on a button will load "Stylesheet1A.css and "Stylesheet12A.css" instead of "Stylesheet1B.css" and "Stylesheet2B.css". This gives me a short period of "no stylesheets" while reloading Could there be a way around this ?
10:05  mekwall: Confused, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/R7uDW/4/ <--- I bet that is what you were looking for?
10:06  Confused: mekwall - that's excellent - thanks for your help!
10:06  mekwall: Confused, np... but that will only toggle the main categories though :p
10:08  wliao: tngraessler, i cannot find this in the jquery documentation.Where is it explained?
10:08  espen_mn: kikita: not sure, but maybe                     $('#my_id').val('something')
10:08  forkrul: Hi I'm using a jQuery component called SlickGrid. It has an onCellChange event. How would I go about 'watching' for this event when it is raised?
10:09  kikita: espen_mn: val return the value ; i find attr("name");
10:09  wliao: tngraessler, can i use like this ?           $("<span>hello</span>").prependTo("#test");
10:09  wliao: tngraessler, <div id="test">test</div>
10:09  Confused: mekwall - i will check with my customer first if that's all they require - if they need the fund details expanded, i'll post here again - thanks very much for your help again
10:09  espen_mn: kikita: could this work: $('#my_id').val('something').change()
10:09  kikita: espen_mn: but now ; how to change this val ? for example if I use your code how to change the value of this checkbox ?
10:10  kikita: ok, with change()
10:10  mekwall: Confused, that plugin is pretty crap if you ask me :P the classes are just dumb
10:11  mekwall: Confused, child-of-node-1-1 <--- wtf? :D
10:11  mekwall: Confused, it's in the id already
10:11  espen_mn: kikita: I am not an expert on this, but this work here:    jq('select#colorschemes_choice').val(this.id).change();    (a select box is set to same as id of an image
10:11  mekwall: the id is "node-1-1"
10:11  mekwall: Confused, the class should just be "child" so that you know it has a parent...
10:11  Confused: Do you know of any better plugins? It's the only one i could find that was half stable :)
10:13  mekwall: Confused, I'd code one myself :P
10:13  Confused: mekwall - hehe
10:14  Confused: mekwall - i'm a noob at jquery so use whatever Google throws up, sorry :)
10:14  dominikl: hi guys, can anyone help me with a little jQuery mobile problem? it's about re-rendering a button: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/howto-refresh-re-render-a-button .... THX in advance for any help / idea!
10:14  mekwall: Confused, I could look into it though
10:14  mekwall: as long as I get credits for it :p
10:15  Confused: mekwall - you would indeed get credit
10:15  Confused: mekwall - this one has drag and drop functionaliy too though
10:16  mekwall: drag and drop is simple, if you mind using jquery ui
10:16  Confused: mekwall - it does the job for now
10:17  Confused: mekwall - need to get this project out of the door but i will need this type of plugin for another job - can i ask you again in future?
10:17  mekwall: Confused, you know where to find me
10:18  Confused: mekwall - are you available for $$$ jobs?
10:18  mekwall: depends on the time needed
10:18  mekwall: I work full-time already, so can't be engage in any bigger projects... but small stuff, sure... can do
10:19  Confused: mekwall - not more complex than this plugin but with better drag drop functionality
10:19  mekwall: Confused, mind scribbling down the requirmenets?
10:19  mekwall: spell!
10:19  mekwall: requirements :)
10:20 --- pipoun|2 is now known as pipoun
10:23  Confused: mekwall - i have basic drag/drop working with this plugin but it's kind of limited right now - i will setup a test case to show you what i am aiming for so perhaps you can quote on requirements when you are available (it's not an urgent job at all).

12:08  markj: do you know javascript already espen_mn?
12:08  markj: if so, i'd just recommend the jquery docs
12:09  espen_mn: markj:  dont reall know much javascript either..... so I probably should start there (?) (where would that be ?)
12:10  espen_mn: I  found a  book at my office called "Java 1.2", should I read that or is javascript much different (or is this the same?)

12:12  espen_mn: trolling is probably the state of beening a troll (or more like trying to be a troll (which is a kind of gobling (?))
12:12  g0rd0n: espen_mn: just google for some jquery tutorials, there are several directly on jquery.com... your book is useless
12:13  g0rd0n: unfo-: yes, my form submission is not working
12:13  g0rd0n: when i put a file input in it
12:13  unfo-: espen_mn, if you were not trolling you are sooooooo far off base if you think java and javascript are somehow related other than in name :)
12:14  unfo-: form type needs to be multipart
12:15  oodavid: unfo- they do have their similarities
12:15  oodavid: syntac, keywords, reserved words
12:15  espen_mn: unfo-:  thought they were different......  what should I read to get the basic of javascript before jquery ?
12:15  oodavid: other than that
12:15  unfo-: oodavid, i knew someone was going to nitpick ;) yes, you can do OOP stuff in both, but on that level if you confuse the two, you can say "they are not the same"
12:15  DaveInDE: This might be a bit off-topic, but I recently bought a mac and was wondering if anyone knew of a good IRC client for it. Currenty I use IRSSI or Trillian depending on the platform I'm on.

12:20  g0rd0n: unfo-: i am using the uploadify plugin to do the file upload, so that works independently of the form... it sets the filename to a hidden input field, so i can use that one when submitting the form
12:20  g0rd0n: hmmm i can try taking that file input field out of the <form> tag
12:20  stongo: doesn't work for example ... but it triggers with mouseout() ... but just not how I want it to

13:30  matt1982: hmm $('.ui-button:first').trigger('click'); seem to get me some way to simulating the clicking of the OK button on a dialog however the selector isn't selecting the .ui-button from the dialog that the click has appeared on. Here is the bind i have: http://pastie.org/1272061
13:32  zfmf: does someone uses the tablesorter pager plugin?
13:33  erichynds: matt1982, try $("#dialog").dialog("widget").find(".ui-button").trigger("click")
13:34  erichynds: ?someone @ zfmf
13:34  bot-t: zfmf, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
13:34  matt1982: so #dialog would the say the id of the dialog i want to have the ok button pressed for?
13:34  rhalff: erichynds: that would click all ui.button I think
13:34  matt1982: thanks erichynds btw
13:35  erichynds: yes, i missed the :first
13:36  matt1982: ahh cool i will add that
13:38  quicksilver: ....(".ui-button:contains('OK')")
13:38  quicksilver: would be another way to choose a particular button by text.
13:39  oodavid: does anyone know if the :contains selector has any speed pitfalls?
13:39  oodavid: I'm using it on about few (10) elements with little text content...
13:39  matt1982: quicksilver, wow thanks will try that out also. I am struggling to make it stay within the same dialog it seemed to be calling the ok click on a different dialog :)
13:39  erichynds: it's probably fast enough, but requires the use of sizzle
13:42  quicksilver: oodavid: it is fairly slow, like all the ":" selectors.
13:42  quicksilver: oodavid: however if you've already narrowed it down to a smallish chunk of possibilities by using faster selectors
13:42  quicksilver: then it's not a problem.
13:42  oodavid: legendary, choice made :D
13:42  quicksilver: :contains over 1000 nodes? Not likely to be a problem
13:42  quicksilver: :contains over 100,000 nodes? May be a bit slow.
13:43  oodavid: heh, I have 10
13:43  oodavid: adding id's to them seemed a bit overkill :D
13:43  jomofcw: In this case : http://pastebin.com/f5ka0C3q the "prependTo" is waiting for the animate to end or not ? plz
13:43  quicksilver: no.
13:43  quicksilver: DOM manipulations don't wait for animations, normally
13:43  quicksilver: only if you ask them to.
13:44  jomofcw: quicksilver OK thanks :)
13:44  quicksilver: because animations are asynchronous, your javascript keeps running.
13:44  quicksilver: normally your script will finish long before the animation.
13:45  quicksilver: if you *want* something to happen after the animation finishes, put it in the callback.
13:45  stongo: does anyone know if mousenter() has to be called before mouseleav() will work?

13:47  stongo: erichynds: hrm, because mouseleave() isn't working for me ... if I replace it with mouseout() it at least triggers what's inside the function, albeit not how I want
13:48  erichynds: how are you using it?

13:48  stongo:     $(this).children('.foobar').fadeOut('fast');

13:50  lucenut: Hey guys. Noob here. I was trying to do a related selects using the jquery.relatedselects.js and copied the simplest example into a test page which worked. Then I applied the same script to a working form in an application and for some reason the related select is firing right when the page loads.
13:50  lucenut: Any ideas what would cause that?
13:51  JKarsrud_: lucenut: Put it in document.ready?
13:51  noxxik: JKarsrud_: Isn't that very unsecure?
13:51  lucenut: I have tried onChange: and onChangeLoad: and they both cause it to fire when the page is loading.
13:51  stongo:   $('.community-list .views-row-unformatted', context).mouseleave(function() {
13:51  stongo:     $(this).children('.description').fadeOut('fast');
13:51  stongo:   });
13:51  stongo: <div class="community-list"><div class="description">blah blah</div></div
13:51  stongo: oops
13:51  lucenut: Yes, it is wrapped in $(document).ready()
13:51  JKarsrud_: noxxik: But how would the client know anything about the server?
13:51  stongo: <div class="community-list"><div class=".views-row-unformatted"> <div class="description">blah blah</div></div?</div>
13:52  erichynds: ?p @ stongo
13:52  bot-t: stongo, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
13:52  erichynds: don't paste in here
13:52  stongo: ok, sorry
13:52  erichynds: lucenut: are you pre-selecting option tags?
13:52  erichynds: i forget how i set that up
13:52  noxxik: JKarsrud_: that's true.
13:53  lucenut: Yes, I am preselecting an option in the first select.
13:53  noxxik: is there any plugins to jquery for doing what I want?
13:53  lucenut: Let me try without that.
13:53  erichynds: lucenut, when you pre-select a tag, it'll cause the relation to kick off
13:53  erichynds: think of like an edit form,
13:53  erichynds: where you need to prepop all the values
13:54  JKarsrud_: noxxik: To get access to something from the server, you'll either have to render something from the server to the client when the page is requested, or you'll have to do a call to the server from JS and do something with the returned value
13:54  phrearch: hi
13:54  noxxik: JKarsrud_: ok, but what about things like xajax etc?
13:54  JKarsrud_: JS/jQuery lives on the client, which has no clue about the serverside code used on the server
13:54  phrearch: im trying to pass a function callback to a jquery plugin, but the content is function (a,c){return new b.fn.init(a,c)}
13:55  noxxik: i know that
13:55  phrearch: instead of the example function its supposed to contain
13:56  JKarsrud_: noxxik: Yeah, xajax is a framework that generates some JS
13:56  stongo: erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/m69Uj/
13:57  JKarsrud_: Atleast that's what it looks like, I have never used it, and I'm not a PHP developer
13:57  erichynds: stongo, what do you want to happen?
13:58  stongo: erichynds: well, there's also a toggle button that toggles the description ... but I also want the description to hide itself (default state) when the user's mouse leaves the parent <div>
13:59  stongo: which isn't working in my script
13:59  stongo: but seems to work in jsfiddle
13:59  stongo: hrm
14:00  stongo: is mouseleave() supported by all browsers?
14:00  erichynds: yes
14:01  stongo: erichynds: that's really strange. it doesn't seem like the actual function I pasted has anything wrong with it
14:01  boaz: hello?
14:02  erichynds: hai
14:02  stongo: I'm also using Drupal, and it's within Drupal.behaviors.javaCustom = function (context) { } instead the usual document.ready
14:03  stongo: maybe my selector, $('.community-list .views-row-unformatted', context) is causing the problem
14:06  stongo: anyway, thanks for the link to that tool jsfiddle.net

15:31  Brodingo: hrm
15:31  Prometheus: rjgoldsborough: append hash of the current active tab on to the URL and read it from there
15:31  AlexA: Hello world
15:31  Prometheus: not particularly nice, but there you go
15:31  AlexA: i need help making this grow http://jsfiddle.net/alex_alexandrescu/WrGea/ up rather then down
15:31  AlexA: than*
15:32  Brodingo: yeah thats what i figured prometheus
15:32  mekwall: rjgoldsborough, ah... now I understand :) you could use cookies
15:32  mekwall: that's how I do it most of the time
15:32  rjgoldsborough: Say a block with tabs for like daily, monthly, yearly. You click monthly, and I need that active, even if I were to change the main site page and cause a reload
15:32  rjgoldsborough: sorry, I can't show, it's a work thing
15:32  mekwall: rjgoldsborough, no need to show anymore... I've done the same numerous times, and always use cookies to store the current tab
15:33  Brodingo: yeah otherwise wouldnt you have to add a click event to all anchors on the page?
15:33  Prometheus: or cookies, yeah
15:33  AlexA: hey mekwall :P
15:33  mekwall: hey
15:33  AlexA: i'm back :D
15:33  rjgoldsborough: alright, cool, thanks mekwall Prometheus Brodingo I really appreciate the quick answers
15:33  mekwall: AlexA, not sure how I should respond to that haha
15:34  AlexA: well you could send some help my way :))

15:35  Prometheus: I guess you should include it in an element that has more height
15:35  Prometheus: then put it at the bottom of that element
15:35  Prometheus: and let it grow
15:35  Prometheus: s/include/contain
15:35  AlexA: howww do i put it at the bottom tried that and failed:D
15:36  Prometheus: use positioning for example
15:36  Prometheus: CSS stuff
15:36  Prometheus: I think that should let it grow upwards, but might not
15:36  Prometheus: I know you can do vertical alignment too
15:36  Prometheus: but I don't know how that works on images
15:36  Prometheus: that you grow the height on*
15:37  AlexA: i'll try that
15:37  Brodingo: well if you set an absolutely positioned element to bottom then adjust the height it would go up
15:38  Prometheus: essentially
15:39  mekwall: AlexA, ah yeah... I recall your problem now :P image inside the sidebar yes?
15:39  AlexA: no no i had another problem 2 days agow about reading data from a json and you helped me out
15:39  AlexA: :D
15:39  mekwall: oh
15:40  mekwall: well... my memory can only hold 512 bytes of data
15:40  AlexA: Thank you guys that worked it goes up :D
15:40  Brodingo: hooray
15:40  AlexA: :D me happy
15:42  AlexA: didn't think about using positioning but the simple stuff is always hardest :D
15:42  AlexA: PARADOX
15:43  AlexA: oh and another question when you have multiple animations on an element is there a way to trigger them at the same time?
15:44  AlexA: nevermind :D got it

16:05  stongo: my jquery validates in jsfiddle.net ... but maybe I'm doing something wrong still? http://jsfiddle.net/m69Uj/2/
16:05  stongo: Brodingo: the mouseleave() event isn't firing
16:05  Brodingo: stongo drupal 6 comes with 1.2.6
16:05  Brodingo: you should at least use jquery update module to get 1.3.2
16:05  Brodingo: unfortunately 1.4.2 breaks certain views module functionality
16:07  stongo: Brodingo: I haven't installed jquery update... maybe that will work, thanks
16:07  Brodingo: i would recommend it
16:07  stongo: because mouseout() fires in place of mouseleave(), so maybe mouseleave() isn't supported
16:08  hariom: Ok, I have resolved the problem. It was json which was not sending right output.

16:14  daks: is it normal that only field one is filled even if using the datepicker on field2?
16:15  daks: and how can i change that?
16:16  v_: Using Javascript we can do like document.getElementById("id").selectedIndex. do we have something like that in jQuery ?
16:16  oralo: i need to pass an array as an option for a jQuery plugin; something like 		closedDates: [[7, 29, 2009], [8, 25, 2010]],
16:16  oralo: what syntax do i use?
16:16  v_: If I use $('#selectCnty :selected') , this it is returning the object
16:17  v_: not selectedIndex
16:17  timing: oralo: looks good to me
16:17  oralo: timing, shoot. it's not working. thanks.
16:17  timing: maybe the array is formatted wrong?
16:17  oralo: daks, no, you need to call two seperate datepickers or use a 'this' function.
16:18  v_: let me know if we have something for selectedIndex in jQuery
16:18  oralo: timing, the array works if it's in another function. now i'm trying to call the array as a parameter. so i added it to the options list. does that sound right?
16:18  v_: oodavid, you there  ?
16:19  daks: oralo: ok that the deal
16:19  daks: (that's the deal)
16:19  oralo: daks, i, personally, would just use to different datepickers. probably not the leanest programming but it will work as expected.
16:19  daks: so if i have 5 forms i need to specify it 5 times
16:19  oodavid: ?selected-selector @ v_

16:20  BRW: hi all
16:20  daks: ok i think i see the point, i'll try it
16:20  oralo: daks, so, get the id name of the clicked form, and then populate it by using (this).
16:20  oralo: daks, i'll start a jsfiddle and we can work on it.
16:21  daks: oralo: seems simple, but i'm a totally newbie on js/jquery

16:21  v_: but I need to know the selectedIndex
16:22  sha1sum: or rather than 2 items at a time, both scrolling off and showing the next 2, I want 2 items at a time, then *one* scrolls off and the next comes in to replace the last.
