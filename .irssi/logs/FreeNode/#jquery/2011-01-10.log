00:01  devinrolsen: yay my plugin is working on ipad and iphone.. I'm happy for least another 24 hours now ^^
00:01 --- Jelmer_ is now known as Guest44438
00:01  Guest44438: Hi all, I was wondering if there's anyone here able to help me out with a simple accordion menu issue I am having.
00:01 --- Guest44438 is now known as JelmerB
00:02  devinrolsen: I'm sad that I couldn't keep my plugin size under 1kb now :(
00:03  draginx: did u pack it?
00:03  JelmerB: If anyone has got a second.. it's regarding this website: http://www.jelmerboskma.com/beta/   I would like the first menu item (home) to be 'unfolded' by default. Is this a hard thing to do? Any tips are welcome!
00:04  JKarsrud: hah, using mysql with django on osx turned out to be a bit harder than expected :P
00:05  taitems: question, if you use disableSelection() on a selector string when the document is ready - and later append/insertBefore etc the elements around to different cells - will the disabling of selection persist?
00:06  gnarf: taitems: likely not
00:06  devinrolsen: draginx - unpacked its 1.7kb, minified its 1.1kb
00:08  taitems: if they're hardcoded styles (like -moz-user-select: none; or whatever) i guess they will persist, but i'm just trying to work out whether i'm going down the right track
00:08  taitems: chrome doesn't appear to persist unfortunately
00:08  Fah: I have a list of entries and I'm trying to combine pagination with the jqueryui accordion. Only the first page works correctly. The subsequent pages contain the right number of rows, but they do not respond to clicks correctly. Anyone run into this?
00:08  draginx: JelmerB: try adding $('#thumbs li a:first').trigger('click');
00:09  gnarf: taitems: .disableSelection() doesn't use any css
00:09  draginx: devinrolsen: awwww boo lol :P Let's see the code
00:09  serard: I can't save a metadata, how to re set a metadata value ?
00:09  taitems: gnarf: oh cool, does it just use onselectstart for IE and other cross browser events?
00:09  JelmerB: draginx, thanks for your reply! Is there a specific place in the script where I should place this?
00:09  gnarf: it is literaly: this.bind( ( $.support.selectstart ? "selectstart" : "mousedown" ) + ".ui-disableSelection", function( event ) { event.preventDefault(); });
00:10  taitems: Fah: do you have a paste version?
00:10  taitems: Fah: you're probably just using bind() when you should be using live() or delegate()
00:10  taitems: or on page change you should rebind the <li>s
00:10  draginx: Anyone here know how to store javascript templates into a normal file and have jquery be able to use it properly?
00:10  draginx: JelmerB: I'd do above/below the .live('click' of that selector (without the ":first")
00:10  draginx: Try below first ;)
00:11  naquad: i've got this: $('table').find('tr td:contains("domain1.com")') but i need to actually select tr, not td. how do i do that?
00:11  webben: r3negade: "a normal file"?
00:11  gnarf: taitems: you could probably abstract that to a .live on a '.ui-disableSelection'
00:11  devinrolsen: draginx - http://pastebin.com/HL141E3R lol
00:11  draginx: naquad: select that then do .parent()
00:11  gnarf: and then attach some clases to it too
00:11  Bartzy: Hi
00:11  SaToNiO: how can i get $(element).attr('onclick') as a string?
00:11  taitems: gnarf: thanks for the help
00:11  naquad: draginx, i'm interested in pure selector, w/o further processing
00:11  Bartzy: Anyone knows about .load() event for <img> not firing in FF & IE but fires in Chrome ?
00:11  draginx: SaToNiO: try adding a "[0]" not sure if that'll work :S
00:11  gnarf: SaToNiO: hopefully that is empty
00:12  gnarf: if you're writing good jQuery - onclick shouldn't have anything
00:12  taitems: naquad: after the find() just go parent() ?
00:12  Fah: taitems: its way more low tech than that. http://jsfiddle.net/Bmxbp/  is an example of me destroying then recreating the next 'page'
00:12  naquad: taitems, draginx, i'm interested in pure selector, w/o further processing
00:12  SaToNiO: [gnarf] i'm writing a greasemonkey script for firefox
00:12  Krinkle: I've got a radio button with a change() handler. It's fired when it's selected, its not fired when clicked upon when alreayd selected (good), but it also doesn't fire when it's deselected (ie. another radio button with the same name is checked)
00:12  draginx: naquad: :parent is a selector
00:12  draginx: http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/
00:12  naquad: oh
00:12  naquad: thank you
00:12  gnarf: naquad: see ?:has
00:12  bot-t: naquad, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
00:12  draginx: yup
00:12  Krinkle: How I can bind a function to the 'uncheck' event so to say ?
00:12  Krinkle: ie. whenever the radio button changes
00:12  naquad: gnarf, draginx, taitems thank you :)
00:12  SaToNiO: [draginx] [0] where?
00:13  gnarf: naquad: however - if you keep your jQuery selectors to pure CSS
00:13  webben: Bartzy: IIRC IE uses onreadystatechange.
00:13  draginx: devinrolsen: looking into ur code now ;) lets see if we can play a ittle bit
00:13  gnarf: you'll get a decent performance benefit
00:13  Bartzy: webben: And FF ?
00:13  JelmerB: draginx, no succes! Too bad... Shouldn't the code include some #content dt elements? That's the script I believe, that's driving the menu... hm?
00:13  devinrolsen: daginx - it's basically v0.3 of http://tinyurl.com/242775o , but yeah if you can peek at that code that would be helpful
00:13  draginx: SaToNiO: right after the $() object (attr.("onclock")[0])
00:13  gnarf: of course, :contains already isn't so, sure
00:13  Bartzy: It worked a while back, now it stopped working
00:13  draginx: JelmerB: ahh do that then basically u want ot just trigger the click onready
00:13  taitems: Krinkle: binding onchange and, inside that function, checking the value or true/false?
00:13  gnarf: draginx: attr('onclick') likely returns a function
00:13  draginx: i thought that was the right selector but apparently not ;) concept stil remains the same
00:14  gnarf: [0]'n it will prolly blow up
00:14  Krinkle: taitems: That's the thing. onchange doesnt' fire when you click a different radio buttion (which makes sense)
00:14  webben: Bartzy: IIRC Fx fires load unless there's an error or the image never successfully loads as an image.
00:14  draginx: gnarf: could be…
00:14  Bartzy: webben: Weird.
00:14  JelmerB: hmm right draginx ! I am an absolute beginner at this, would be able to write the line again that I should put in there? :)
00:14  Krinkle: clicking radio B in the same group causes radio button A to be deselected. So A does 'change'.
00:15  draginx: JelmerB: yup throw it in below whichever is the menu links..
00:15  gnarf: SaToNiO: in firefox, you could .toSource() the function returned prolly
00:15  SaToNiO: hmm gnarf it's not returning a function
00:15  webben: Bartzy: Ah ... are you setting the listener after setting the src?
00:15  taitems: Krinkle: on focus? on click? i think i remember running into this but i can't remember the solution
00:15  gnarf: SaToNiO: what is it returning?
00:15  SaToNiO: it's giving a component not available exception
00:15  taitems: Krinkle: whatever the solution was, it was probabbly a different one for IE ;)
00:15  draginx: devinrolsen: you have a lot of var = ; var =; you can just do var = <whatever>, <whatever2>, <whatever3>, etc..
00:15  draginx: although i think pack does that for u anyway
00:15  Bartzy: webben: Yes. The src is in the HTML, while the load listener is in JS (document.ready)
00:15  Krinkle: taitems: neither.
00:16  Bartzy: webben: Also, it seems that it works when firebug is open
00:16  Krinkle: taitems: clicking B does not fire onclick A obviously
00:16  taitems: Fah: have you considered using template or cloning a hidden div instead of recreating the DIV entirely?
00:16  Krinkle: neither does focus.
00:16  Krinkle: I need to detect when it's deselected.
00:16  gnarf: Krinkle: fiddle?
00:16  Krinkle: I want a div to slideToggle based on whether this radio button is on or off.
00:16  webben: Bartzy: Well then the listener will likely not fire since the image has already loaded.
00:16  SaToNiO: can i get the dom node from the jquery object?
00:16  devinrolsen: if I do use var = <whatever>, <whatever2>, <whatever3>, I fail to see how I assign uniqe values to each var.?
00:16  Bartzy: webben: Nevermind the firebug thingie. What about src before load listener ?
00:16  SaToNiO: maybe with getAttribute ...
00:16  Krinkle: gnarf: you got it.
00:16  Fah: taitems: I'm just trying to get the accordion to work right, this is not exactly optimal right now. Would a cloned div help with that?
00:17  Bartzy: webben: The document.ready() happens only after all images in the html has loaded fully ?
00:17  webben: Bartzy: JQuery.ready() ?
00:17  Bartzy: webben: Yes.
00:18  webben: Bartzy: Read the first line in the documentation at http://api.jquery.com/ready/
00:18  gnarf: Bartzy: no, $(document).ready() happens when the entire DOM has loaded and is available to manipulate
00:18  BinaryKitten: images load later
00:18  Bartzy: webben: So the load listener WILL be bound
00:18  Bartzy: my code is inside document.ready.
00:18  taitems: Fah: nope, it won't really help too much for anything but readability
00:18  webben: Bartzy: Only if the image loads before the script is executed.
00:18  webben: *after*
00:19  webben: Bartzy: If the image loads before the script is parsed, added to the DOM, and executed
00:19  webben: then there will be no further 'load' event fired by the image.
00:19  Bartzy: webben: How is that possible ? The script is in <head>, get parsed before HTML
00:19  Fah: taitems; so even if i hardcode my offsets, anything other than starting at 0 does not work.
00:19  Bartzy: webben: So how do  fix it ?
00:19  Bartzy: webben: I want the script to execute ONLY after the image has loaded... it's a race condition :\
00:20  webben: Bartzy: Well in that case, it's possible because the image load might still precede the complete parsing of the markup into the DOM.
00:20  taitems: Fah: i think you should open this up to the floor again, im trying to do some work :P
00:20  gnarf: Bartzy: if the image is cached you may never get a load event
00:20  taitems: thought yours would be a quick easy one
00:20  taitems: :P
00:20  Fah: no prob
00:20  gnarf: ?g imagesLoaded jquery plugin
00:20  bot-t: gnarf, gist: 268257 - imagesLoaded() jquery plugin- GitHub - https://gist.github.com/268257
00:20  Krinkle: gnarf: taitems http://jsfiddle.net/cfyvs/
00:20  Krinkle: when you click "Custom" and then another there's no alert
00:21  taitems: gnarf: PS. yeah it did need to be rebound after it is appended
00:21  taitems: never followed that up
00:21  taitems: thanks and bye
00:21  Krinkle: (at first there is, obviously, but not when it get's deselected)
00:21  Bartzy: gnarf: I clear the cache before the test.
00:21  JelmerB: Draginx I've added the line $('#content>dt>a:first').trigger('click');   and it's not seeming to do anything right now... Probably doing it wrong ;P
00:21  gnarf: Bartzy: take a look at that plugin there bartzy
00:22  Fah: I think the root of the issue is that i'm using slice incorrectly
00:22  Bartzy: gnarf: But I don't think that's my problem. I clear the cache before I test.
00:22  gnarf: Bartzy: its still a really damn useful plugin :)
00:22  gnarf: try it
00:22  SaToNiO: how can i get the element related with a jquery object? $("#id") how can i get the DOM element?
00:22  Bartzy: gnarf:that doesn't fix my problem, I think
00:23  Bartzy: gnarf: Just replaced it with .bind('load') ?
00:23  gnarf: Bartzy: you want to detect if an image loaded right?
00:23  Bartzy: yes.
00:23  gnarf: thats the best cross browser way to do so
00:23  draginx: JelmerB: can you please copy + paste the first line that opens the menu and then the <a href home> line?
00:23  Bartzy: gnarf: OK.
00:23  Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/cfyvs/1/
00:23  Krinkle: gnarf: (I added some comments)
00:23  Krinkle: gnarf: Any idea ?
00:24  gnarf: lookin
00:24  Bartzy: gnarf: But it doesn't ruin the cache right ?
00:24  Bartzy: Meaning if the image is in cache it will still load it from cache right ?
00:24  JelmerB: Draginx, I believe the first line that is regarding the menu starts with: $(function(){		 		$('#content:not(.nav_block)>dt:not(.active) a,footer .privacy:not(.active) a[rel=privacy]').live('click',function(){
00:24  Krinkle: I've been googling on this for almost an hour now... Only getting different stuff :) Search engines are nice but sometimes they suck.
00:24  JelmerB: Draginx, and the ahref for the first menu item (home) is <dl id="content">     <dt class="dt1"><a href="#"></a>
00:25  gnarf: Krinkle: only thought is $("input[name=filter-prefix]").change()
00:25  rudyl313: I have a div with a click listener, but inside the div I have some a links. How do I prevent the click listener from triggering on the div if the user clicks one of the a links?
00:25  gnarf: kinda hackish, but likely the only way you'll detect it
00:26  draginx: JelmerB: how the fuck does ut code know it's "Home"?
00:26  gnarf: rudyl313: .click(function(e) { if ($(e.target).is('a') return; }
00:26  Krinkle: gnarf: Hm.. it needs to be more dynamic than that (ie. the name value is not static)
00:26  draginx: change <a href="#"> to "<a href="#" id="home_link"> then $("#home_link").trigger('click'); hopefully thatll work
00:26  gnarf: or - e.stopPropagation() on your a event
00:26  JelmerB: Draginx, I wish I'd know :/ This thing I bought from a template website....
00:26  draginx: but christ that's a rather complicated selector for the menu..
00:26  JelmerB: word
00:27  dr4g: gnarf, hey yea on last night's note - i just include the .js files in the order that index.html includes them
00:27  draginx: ahhh thats why i always preferred my own custom :P people make shit WAY to complicated than what it has to be
00:27  Krinkle: ie. there's about 10 of these cases on one page
00:27  rudyl313: gnarf: I will try that thanks :)
00:27  gnarf: Krinkle: var my = this; $(this).closest('form').find('input[type=radio]').filter(funciton() { this.name = my.name })
00:28  JelmerB: Draginx... haha, do you think you think you could have a peak one more time at the source code of the link I pasted? :) It sounds like you know quite a bit about this :) I sitll am convinced it can't be that hard
00:28  draginx: lol alright btw ur site looks nice
00:28  JelmerB: Thank you! :)
00:28  Krinkle: gnarf: Hm.. interesting.
00:29  Bartzy: gnarf thanks a lot.
00:29  Krinkle: gnarf: Do you think there's any chance or possibilty in making a variation on $.fn.change() that will 'work' with this ?
00:29  gnarf: Krinkle: um, lemme think on a general case
00:29  Krinkle: ie. $('.radioButtonsThatAreSpecialAmongTheirSisters').realChange()
00:30  Krinkle: I rather not repeat this code for each radio button that is 'special' in it's group (ie. that I want to do something with when selected)
00:30  Krinkle: such as showing an input field
00:30  gnarf: Krinkle: easier to bind to the change on all the radios with that name
00:31  styol: anyone familiar with whether or not #hash tags are indexed by most search engines? i kinda recall reading somewhere that they are not, but just curious if anyone knows offhand or by experience
00:31  Krinkle: so fn.realChange would .each : select other equally named ones, bind change() and if this.is(originalSelector), fire callback.
00:31  gnarf: styol: they are not
00:31  JelmerB: Draginx, what do you think? Is it really written unreadble, or are you making sense of it? :)
00:32  gnarf: Krinkle: you want the callback fired regardless of the original selector though
00:32  styol: gnarf: do you think /page/#/somehash would get indexed possibly?
00:32  gnarf: styol: never
00:32  Krinkle: Google has been experimenting on this. For example twitter and YouTube do this and it's indexed.
00:32  Krinkle: ie. ajax permalinks
00:32  gnarf:  /page/ is the same as /page/#anything in a search engines eyes
00:33  gnarf: at least, the request / page returned will be
00:33  Krinkle: What Google does in those cases ( think the #hash needs to start with a ! symbol) is execute 1 second of javascript before indexing in a virtual browser.
00:33  draginx: JelmerB: diivng into it now
00:33  Krinkle: I dont know if they do this for all sites or just their own
00:33  jrockjiggz: hi, i'm having trouble getting $(this) to work in an $.ajax function http://jsfiddle.net/rD56C/
00:33  JelmerB: awesome, thanks a ton draginx
00:34 --- onre is now known as Guest62702
00:34  dr4g: gnarf, did you see my msg above ?
00:34  gnarf: Krinkle: be interested in seeing any docs / links on that
00:34  gnarf: dr4g: nope
00:34  devinrolsen: thanks draginx, I got what you were saying now, that indeed trimmed a little fat off.
00:34  Krinkle: gnarf: http://www.google.nl/search?q=google+hash+tag+index+ajax

00:36  gnarf: Krinkle++ :)
00:36 --- EoN` is now known as EoN
00:36  Krinkle: gnarf: I haven't used it. but it's pretty interesting stuff
00:36  styol: delicious
00:37  gnarf: Krinkle: i can't think of a good general case for handling that... when dealing with radios, its probably best to attach change to all the radios and check val()
00:37  jrockjiggz: actually.. i dont know. i'm getting a error with jquery.js
00:37  Bartzy: <!DOCTYPE html> is not supported in IE??
00:38  Krinkle: gnarf: k
00:38  gnarf: jrockjiggz: "this" inside an ajax callback will be the ajax options
00:38  Krinkle: Bartzy: false, it is 'supported'
00:38  Bartzy: ok..
00:38  Bartzy: how can I know if IE is in quirks mode or standard mode ?
00:38  Krinkle: whatever that means. Is there a problem ?
00:38  gnarf: jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rD56C/1/
00:40  draginx: JelmerB: dont thank me yet im 50% through
00:40  Krinkle: ajpiano: Just watched the last two yayQuery episodes. I had never asociated you with 'him'. In that I didn't know that the 'a' in ajpiano was 'adam'. I think that's the first time you mentioned it :)
00:40  draginx: but this last 50% is a bit tricky
00:40  JelmerB: draginx: I appreciate your time sir :) Either way
00:40  ajpiano: hhaha Krinkle ;
00:40  ajpiano: ;)
00:41  Krinkle: ajpiano: We should implement some kind of IRC plugin to raise papers ;-)
00:41  Krinkle: ie. to visually draw a topic
00:41  Krinkle: Awesome

00:42  elryry: hey guys can anyone let me know why the modal dialog isn't popping up when i press siginin input: http://jsfiddle.net/TuUqC/
00:42  Krinkle: I find them quite helpful since I'm not a native and your papers let me know how to spell stuff (so I can google for more)
00:42  jrockjiggz: this simple function is giving me jquery error, the url is self-refering - loading with fragment http://jsfiddle.net/rD56C/2/
00:45  styol: gnarf and Krinkle -- thank you berry much
00:45  jrockjiggz: i don't think its jquery - n
00:45  jrockjiggz: nm
00:45  gnarf: jrockjiggz: did you read my earlier messages?
00:45  gnarf: i already fixed it for ya
00:45  jrockjiggz: sorry missed that!
00:45  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/BS7bA/ <--- why doesn't ga.js get loaded?!
00:45  mekwall: tried with getScript as well
00:45  jrockjiggz: gnarf: ty!
00:45  jrockjiggz: i was about to give up
00:46  JelmerB: draginx: don't kill yourself on it
00:48  mekwall: gnarf: can you see what's wrong?
00:48  gnarf: mekwall: perhaps the lack of http(s): before the //
00:48  mekwall: nah
00:48  gnarf: although it SHOULD work like that
00:48  mekwall: gnarf: check the debug console, the request is sent
00:49  gnarf: it seems that its working
00:50  gnarf: i mean, it loads a __utm
00:50  draginx: JelmerB: this is rather complicated O_o im firing off the right call but it's still not picking up on anything else hmm
00:50  gnarf: ajpiano: did u see my tweet last night? :)
00:51  ajpiano: i did!

00:52  mekwall: ajpiano: .getScript doesn't cache right?
00:53  ajpiano: um i think it cache-busts by default

00:57  JelmerB: hmm for me the image is just showing 20 pixels or something on the bottom
00:57  JelmerB: below the home button
00:57  draginx: not sure what u mean
00:57  draginx: dinner time
00:57  draginx: PM me if u want to continue/still havent figured it out
00:58  JelmerB: thanks again man! I'll have anoter look
01:00  mekwall: gnarf: lol! www.google-analytics.com/ga.js does not exist :)
01:00  mekwall: neither does https://ssl.google-analytics.gom/ga.js
01:00  mekwall: it's google-analytics.gom/ga.js all the way

01:07  mekwall: gnarf: did you check out my jquery ui tooltip widget?
01:07  gnarf: mekwall: nope
01:07  mekwall: gnarf: http://writeless.se/2011/01/jquery-ui-tooltip-widget/
01:09  gnarf: mekwall: are you working in master branch on your local?
01:10  gnarf: you should checkout a separate branch for your dev
01:10  mekwall: gnarf: just forked it today
01:10  gnarf: mekwall: cuz now your "master" branch will include those changes
01:11  mekwall: was hoping to be able to fork just that part, but didn't seem so
01:11  mekwall: I'm a total newbie at github, so I have no clue hehe
01:13  BinaryKitten: mekwall to github or git
01:14  mekwall: BinaryKitten: both kinda
01:14  BinaryKitten: because one is a service the other a tool. The Serice makes use of the tool.
01:14  mekwall: I know
01:14  BinaryKitten: have you used subversion?
01:14  mekwall: been using git (the tool) way more then github
01:14  mekwall: of course, work with svn daily
01:14  BinaryKitten: what would you like to know about git?
01:14  ss23: We skipped SVN here, went straight from CVS -> git :D
01:14  BinaryKitten: asuming you would llike to know something or other
01:15  mekwall: BinaryKitten: thing is, I am working on a jquery ui tooltip fork
01:15  BinaryKitten: ok..
01:15  mekwall: and I've been working on it outside of github, but decided to add it there today
01:15  BinaryKitten: right
01:16  mekwall: so I went to the source, and chose to fork it... which forked the whole jquery-ui project
01:16  BinaryKitten: heh
01:16  mekwall: :P
01:16  mekwall: anyways, I commited my changes to the tooltip widget
01:16  BinaryKitten: ok and pushed them?
01:16  mekwall: no, I did this right through the website
01:17  mekwall: didn't use the tool
01:17  mekwall: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js
01:17  BinaryKitten: didn't know that github did live editing/commits
01:17  mekwall: it does :)
01:17  gnarf: BinaryKitten: yeah, it is pretty sweet :)
01:17  gnarf: mekwall: my point was you don't want to make your changes in your forked master
01:17  mekwall: anyways, the commit went right into the master branch which isn't a good thing I guess hehe
01:18  gnarf: push that commit into a branch
01:18  BinaryKitten: depends really
01:18  gnarf: cuz then you can file a pull request on that branch
01:18  gnarf: pretty easily
01:18  BinaryKitten: check with the jquery repo manager
01:18  mekwall: oh well, I aint planning on commiting anytime soon...
01:19  BinaryKitten: yeah easy except if you don't understand pull requests and such
01:19  danielfilho: anyone can help me with jquery mobile? :D
01:19  danielfilho: oh, just found it. =*
01:19  mekwall: BinaryKitten: I'll look into it, I just wanted to get the code up on github
01:19  mekwall: been dragging out for too long already :)
01:20  BinaryKitten: :D
01:20  BinaryKitten: i'm going to log off now.. brain gone to mush
01:20  mekwall: same
01:20  mekwall: I blame it on you!
01:20  BinaryKitten: except i blamed you much earlier and you can't counter blame it on me
01:21  mekwall: :(
01:21  mekwall: you must have a time machine
01:21  BinaryKitten: I do.
01:21  mekwall: cheater.
01:21  BinaryKitten: but it's out of plutonium
01:21  mekwall: damn russians
01:21  BinaryKitten: and unfortunately the area i live in means getting up to 88 mph is a problem
01:22  mekwall: hehe
01:22  BinaryKitten: libians actually
01:22  BinaryKitten: but don't worry, i'me wearing a bullet proof vest because i was warned about them in the past

01:25 --- xtc__ is now known as xtc
01:25  mekwall: draginx: i don't really get what you mean... you can use remote data
01:25  mekwall: which basically means it's in a file?
01:25  mekwall: somewhere else
01:26  draginx: mekwall: the actual template
01:26  draginx: not what needs to be parsed
01:26  draginx: <script id="movieTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">code…</script?
01:27  draginx: that part i need to be translated so it can go into a file
01:27  draginx: basically I want to store multiple templates into one file and then call only one template or may be three of those templates at a time on the actual page (not all templates will be used)
01:27  mekwall:  <script id="movieTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" src="url_to_file"></script> ? :)
01:27  Fishfish0001: Hi
01:28  draginx: mekwall: riiiight but that stores ALL of the templates/code into that ONE single id
01:28  Fishfish0001: I hate JS bugs :(
01:28  draginx: thats NOT what i want tod
01:28  draginx: i want to do the OPPOSITE of that so i can SELECT whichever ones i want to use at a given time
01:29  draginx: Basically, I don't want to be inling
01:29  mekwall: draginx: ok, well I haven't really been using templates so I'm not much of help :) and I'm going to sleep anyways
01:29  draginx: night
01:29  mekwall: nn
01:29  jrockjiggz: $('#fragment').load('url #frament') will load <div id="fragment"> as part of the html.. :(
01:30  draginx: is the url returning that?
01:34  Fishfish0001: Can someone help me with this code: http://dane.everitt.pastebin.com/g53DjkAQ
01:34  Fishfish0001: I'm using it to return text sorrounded with BBCode tags. However, it removes the text from inside the tags unless I hit enter a few times and type some stuff in, then it works fine.
01:52  Bartzy: if $.ajax has dataType json, and the response is totally empty (but 200), the success callback won't fire ?

01:53  danielfilho: haha
01:54  danielfilho: could anyone help me?

02:40  beastman: im just trying to do a  simple .click and its going crazy
02:40  Fishfish0001: How so
02:41  beastman: it almost seems like its continuously clicking it, its not in a loop or anything

02:42  beastman: http://pastebin.com/vLWcUYtk
02:42  beastman: i have it at the end of the page
02:43  beastman: woops, also echoing out of php, so that explains the weird variables
02:43  Fishfish0001: Oh ok
02:43  Fishfish0001: Whats the click() supposed to do?
02:43  Fishfish0001: It looks like it is just there
02:44  beastman: well i just spent like 2 hours writing a function for when a form gets submitted
02:44  beastman: now im going back and trying to handle get variables that might be passed to the page as well
02:45  Fishfish0001: Usually hy are used like $('#go').click(function(){ //Do Something });
02:45  beastman: so i figured id read in the get variables, set the form to those values, then simulate the clicking of the Go button
02:45  Fishfish0001: I don't know how to simulate the clicking, but thats orobably not the right way
02:45  Fishfish0001: Why not just use AJAX?
02:45  beastman: for what?
02:45  Fishfish0001: Submitting
02:46  beastman: i think i am...
02:46  Fishfish0001: Or maybe send GET request (or POST), that will trigger the submission engine
02:46  beastman: that part is entirely complete, submits awesome
02:47  beastman: but the problem that rose was how to handle get variables that might be passed to this page
02:47  Fishfish0001: I don't think click() repliactes a click, its ment to be used when omething is clicked
02:47  beastman: arose*
02:47  gnarf: beastman: that seems prone to issues (your paste)
02:47  Fishfish0001: *something
02:47  gnarf: you really shouldn't ever echo php in you javascript
02:47  beastman: gnarf: your prognosis proves true
02:48  gnarf: can you tell me WHY you wrote this code initially?
02:48  beastman: wait, im echoing javascript from my pphp
02:48  Fishfish0001: I echo PHP in some of my JS, but only in one dnamic spot that depends on the page
02:48  beastman: gnarf, figure you have a AJAX form, submitting asynch
02:48  beastman: everything works great, no refresh, pulls info, append <li>'s, so sexy
02:49  gnarf: okay
02:49  beastman: now figure the problem arises for when you need to pass variables to this page
02:49  beastman: through GET or POST
02:49 --- remysharp-away is now known as remysharp
02:49  gnarf: lost
02:49  FM4k: Hey all - dumb, dumb question:
02:50  gnarf: "pass variables to this page"
02:50  beastman: lol let me try to rephrase
02:50  FM4k: how do I get the DOM to refresh after AJAX?
02:50  gnarf: FM4k: meaning?
02:50  FM4k: gnarf - may I PM you?
02:50  gnarf: best not to
02:50  FM4k: lol
02:50  FM4k: just to send you a link
02:50  gnarf: someone else might benefit from your further explaination
02:50  FM4k: lol
02:50  FM4k: fine -
02:50  FM4k: http://staging.jotunn.org/
02:51  FM4k: go there, then go to contact.
02:51  beastman: 1 sec
02:51  FM4k: In contact, hover over the "send" button; It should animate, etc. After that, go to any other page but home, then go back to contact: The hover event will cease to function
02:52  gnarf: FM4k: ahh
02:52  gnarf: okay
02:52  FM4k: yea
02:52  FM4k: so the problem stems from jQuery not updating the DOM
02:52  gnarf: FM4k: nope,
02:52  FM4k: Nope?
02:52  gnarf: the problem stems from you not rebinding your events to the new content coming from ajax
02:52  gnarf: :)
02:53  FM4k: how might I re-bind events like that?
02:53  gnarf: that is a little more complex that you might hope
02:53  FM4k: ugh.
02:53  FM4k: Take a look at my scripts file
02:53  gnarf: can you pastebin the code that ajaxs the content
02:53  FM4k: and tell me how much trouble I'm asking for? lol
02:53  gnarf: and the code that does the hover effect
02:54  gnarf: also - you may be able to convert to using .live() or .delegate()
02:54  gnarf: kinda depends on the content tho
02:54  gnarf: basic idea though:
02:55  FM4k: Gnarf: http://staging.jotunn.org/.scripts/library/jquery/jquery-execute.js
02:55  gnarf: $('#something') will find something that is currently in the dif
02:55  gnarf: dif = dom of course
02:55  gnarf: FM4k: alright, wont be that hard
02:56  FM4k: gnarf - alright... lol
02:56  gnarf: gonna have to rethink a bit tho
02:56  gnarf: your success function on load
02:56  gnarf: gets fresh dom content, and sticks it in
02:57  gnarf: INSIDE there, you want to look for those "page only" things in this new content
02:57  gnarf: and attach your events
02:57  FM4k: but what happens, then
02:57  FM4k: if the scrips are called before the ajax even t?
02:57  FM4k: or would I need two batches of  scripts, 1 for before ajax and one for after?
02:57  gnarf: FM4k: suggestion
02:58  beastman: fixed, i replace  with .submit()
02:58  gnarf: function bindPageContentEvents() {}
02:58  gnarf: drop all your $("#content-work ....") stuff in that function
02:58  gnarf: and call it immediately
02:58  gnarf: and also call it after your ajax stuff
02:59  gnarf: you should just be careful
02:59  gnarf: because you don't want to bind events twice
02:59  gnarf: but anytime you make new DOM elements, you should bind the proper events to them
02:59  gnarf: or you could switch to using .live()
03:00  gnarf: ?.live
03:00  bot-t: .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
03:00  gnarf: "hover" is shortcut for "mouseenter" and "mouseleave"
03:00  FM4k: right...
03:00  FM4k: ugh.
03:00  gnarf: but if you bound using live
03:00  FM4k: I might just ditch the entire AJAX function
03:00  gnarf: those events are gonna be there forever
03:00  FM4k: because this is really kind of a big pain in teh ass. lol
03:01  FM4k: You'd figure jquery would take care of this after a while :P
03:01  gnarf: FM4k: what i end up doing
03:01  gnarf: in my code
03:01  FM4k: yea?
03:01  gnarf: is make a $.fn.bindPageEvents = function() { this.find('#content-contact')..... }
03:02  FM4k: so
03:02  gnarf: then $(document).bindPageEvents()
03:02  gnarf: and $(newAjaxContent).bindPageEvents()
03:02  FM4k: im still a little lost at the actual... usage
03:02  FM4k: I hate to be a pain, but can you make up a tiny demo and toss it up somewhere for me to look at?
03:02  gnarf: um
03:03  gnarf: ill just hack your js file to the way i would do it
03:03  gnarf: and you can try it
03:03  FM4k: :-o well thank you then
03:03  FM4k: I'll owe you a beer :)
03:03  owen1_: i have a draggable that does not seem to work. how to trace all the javascript that is running when i dragging the element?
03:07  draginx: Is there a way to temporarily store an object/string of data with jquery?
03:07  draginx: I guess I could just throw everything into an array =/ nvm
03:07  FM4k: lol draginx, how do you mean?
03:07  gnarf: FM4k: http://www.jsfiddle.net/GBAbX/ - does that make sense?
03:07  FM4k: uh...
03:08  gnarf: owen1: firebug / chrome debugger + a whole lot of breakpoints
03:08  gnarf: http://www.jsfiddle.net/GBAbX/embedded/js
03:08  FM4k: hm
03:08  gnarf: you make a plugin ($.fn) and you call it on the document at page load
03:08  FM4k: oh I see
03:08  gnarf: and on the new content at ajax load
03:08  FM4k: that makes sense, yea
03:09  gnarf: yeah
03:09  gnarf: coo
03:09  FM4k: this thing will work too?
03:09  gnarf: FM4k: it should, one potential issue
03:09  gnarf: this.find() is not the same as $()
03:09  gnarf: it only searches for the query within the selector
03:09  FM4k: what's teh difference, particularly?
03:09  gnarf: $("<div id='bob'>").find('#bob') = nothing
03:10  gnarf: because #bob isn't a child
03:10  gnarf: it IS
03:10  draginx: FM4k: I'll be retrieving ajax calls with a paramter ?id=X
03:10  gnarf: it also wouldn't find "body a"
03:10  gnarf: for instance
03:10  draginx: basically I want to store X so that if it does exist, just show that info rather than making another ajax call
03:11  gnarf: but, the advantages are definate
03:11  FM4k: Oh I see
03:11  gnarf: using this.find() you're basically guarnteed to never get content outside of what you passed in
03:13  FM4k: I see :)
03:14  gnarf: draginx: use a cache
03:14  draginx: gnarf, riiight im asking how? :P
03:14  gnarf: FM4k: cuz the only think that sucks more than not binding events
03:14  gnarf: is double binding
03:14  draginx: or u mean cache:true on the ajax
03:14  FM4k: hm.
03:14  draginx: im storing the values into a template....
03:14  draginx: not sure if that will help O-o
03:14  draginx: i guess it would be fine if it were cache'd most bottleneck is in network anyway
03:14  gnarf: draginx: var myCache = {}
03:15  gnarf: if (myCache[term]) { callback(myCache[term])
03:15  gnarf: else { $.ajax(....success: function(data) { myCache[term] = data; callback(data)
03:15  draginx: gracias
03:16  gnarf: just make sure that cache is scoped

03:20  gnarf: templaedhel: that?
03:21  templaedhel: gnarf: No, its a response one someone asks why they can't set a variable in a callback, then get it outside

03:26  coldhead: you're sighing at phantoms
03:27  gnarf: draginx: you can access objects like arrays
03:27  gnarf: and if ('key' in myObj) will tell you if it has been set
03:27  gnarf: myObj['key'] works too
03:28  Lumpio-: I like sighing
03:28  gnarf: although 'key' in obj will tell you if it is set to false as well
03:28  draginx: ah alright thanks :)
03:28  gnarf: ?eval var obj = {}, term='test'; obj[term] = 'Hey there'; print JSON.stringify(obj)
03:28  bot-t: gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
03:29  gnarf: dunno where i typoed there
03:29  gnarf: oh
03:29  gnarf: no () on print
03:29  CrabDude: alright, I'll add a ticket to remove if no one else knows why xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest"); shouldn't be called for CORS... ?
03:29  gnarf: (head full of php today)
03:29  draginx: booo :P
03:29  jqueryBoy: ?json
03:29  bot-t: jqueryBoy, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
03:29  jqueryBoy: ?parse json
03:29  bot-t: jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
03:30  gnarf: ?eval var obj = {}, term='test'; obj[term] = 'Hey there'; console.log(obj); @draginx
03:30  bot-t: draginx: {"test": "Hey there"}
03:30  jqueryBoy: thath function only parse a json string ?
03:30  gnarf: jqueryBoy: yep
03:31  gnarf: ?json2
03:31  bot-t: Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)

03:31  gnarf: if you want the opposite
03:33  draginx: Whats a quick way to create a new div, set its position right above the mouse and append information to it? :P
03:33  joelklabo: how do i make an ajax call right when the page loads? instead of binding it to a click or something?
03:33  jqueryBoy: [gnarf] what do the json2.js ? and the other files ?
03:33  draginx: joelklabo: $.ajax() O_o call it normally should do the trick
03:33  joelklabo: draginx: thanks!
03:34  xaristax: Joelklabo or maybe with window.load() or document.ready()
03:35  gnarf: ♫yayQuery, yayQuery - A whole lotta yay and a query too
03:36  draginx: is it better to use pageX or clientX?
03:37  xaristax: Draginx good question i always use clientX but will be good know the diff
03:37  draginx: yer a lot of examples are using pageX lol =x
03:37  gnarf: ?event object
03:37  bot-t: gnarf, Event Object - jQuerys event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards . The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied ov... http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
03:37  draginx: pageX supposively supports NS4
03:37  draginx: ah
03:38  gnarf: pageX is normalized
03:38  gnarf: clientX is also guarnteed
03:38  gnarf: so either is safe
03:38  xaristax: Lol
03:39  tuxie: hi, I have an element with dragstop and click bindings, the problem is that when the user drags the element both gets called... how can I prevent this?
03:41 --- danheberden is now known as danheberden|away
03:44  esparkman: l4rk: i have a question if you are still around
03:44  dizabled: tuxie:  to avoid .click being called, you could use .mouseup() and then write logic to determine whether or not the dragging had taken place before you fire off your click code
03:44  gnarf: esparkman: way to make the rest of us feel tiny ;)
03:45  esparkman: gnarf: sorry, this isn't a jquery question and i knew l4rk had been in here.
03:46  tuxie: dizabled, I receive the event handler as a parameter, can I know from it the different events that were triggered?
03:50  dizabled: tuxie:  I don't know, someone else in the room may
03:50  draginx: Anyway I can call "event" object through getJSON function?
03:50  draginx: Or would I have to do jQuery.event.pageX ?
03:50  CrabDude: Learned something new. When X-Rquested-With (or any custom "X-******" header) is sent with a CORS request, it gets preflighted (2 requests get sent, 1 for permissions, 1 for the actual request): https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control#section_4
03:50  joelklabo: if i get json from django do i have to JSON.objectify or something to use it in my js?
03:50  gnarf: draginx: getJSON doesn't use event
03:50  CrabDude: That's why X-Requested-With is removed for remote requests in jQuery.ajax =)
03:50  draginx: joelklabo: depends on what ur doing..
03:50  gnarf: :)
03:51  draginx: gnarf, hmm bind does! :D
03:51  draginx: but will pass?
03:51  gnarf: if you are calling getJSON from an event handler, your event will still be in scope right?
03:51  draginx: and it does
03:51  tuxie: dizabled, thanks
03:51  joelklabo: i am using jquery .get() to hit this line in my code: simplejson.dumps( [{'id':drink.id, 'latitude':drink.latitude, 'longitude':drink.longitude, 'brew':drink.brew.name} for drink in DRINK_LOCATIONS])
03:51  draginx: joelklabo: $.ajax({dataType: "jsonp"}) or just "json" I forget
03:52  draginx: normally I just do $.getJSON()
03:52  gnarf: joelklabo: JSON.parse -- or $.parseJSON()
03:52  joelklabo: ahhh, yeah
03:53  joelklabo: .getJSON took care of it, sweetness. i love jquery
03:54  gnarf: it loves you too
03:56  draginx: gnarf: you mind taking a quick peek at some code that I'm having trouble with? Just trying to get a div to show but for some reason jquery isn't constructing it O_o
03:56  draginx: o wait im an a-hole hold on :P
03:56  gnarf: fiddle?
03:57  draginx: uhh i was just gonna give u a link to it >.>
03:57  draginx: i dont think fiddle will be able to show u what im trying to do without me messing around
03:57  gnarf: nice pijapfpotw
03:58  draginx: http://cripplewars.com/why.html at the bottom of the source you'll see everything we've been talking about..
03:58  draginx: well sort of the bottom :P starts on line 194

04:04  beastman: i would like to thank all you geniuses for the near spoon feeding during this rough process
04:04  draginx: beastman* gnarf, any idea why jquery doesnt want to appendTo('body') ?
04:05  gnarf: draginx: dunno, is it really getting called? have you tried console.loggin it?
04:05  l4rk: esparkman: what up
04:05  draginx: gnarf: nope im an a-hole will do that right now (just thought of it before i got the ping too)
04:06  gnarf: heh.. $.fn.plugin
04:06  esparkman: l4rk: sorry to bug you, i know at hashrocket VIM was the weapon of choice. How did you guys handle running your tests while working inside VIM?
04:08  draginx: gnarf: console.log on the tmpl works...
04:08  draginx: idk why it's not appendingTo
04:08  l4rk: esparkman: you got the wrong guy sorry :(
04:09  esparkman: l4rk: :D, sorry to bug ya man. Have a good one.
04:09  fris: beastman care to share sling.php? :p
04:09  l4rk: but if its any help esparkman you can bind any command in vim, so something like :noremap <F2> :!tests.py<CR> would probably work
04:10  l4rk: i tend to run tests as pre-commits in git
04:10  l4rk: and block a commit if anything fails
04:10  beastman: fris, you reverse engineering you SOB
04:10  draginx: gnarf: and just printing the html works lol :S
04:10  beastman: ?
04:10  esparkman: l4rk: awesome. i'll give it a shot. Thanks again.

04:21  gnarf: draginx: in that fiddle, because $.template is not a function
04:21  draginx: oh i see
04:22  draginx: well if i appendTo('#content') it works O_o
04:22  draginx: not the fiddle

04:53  Soopaman: I'm having a heck of a time generating a selector that resembles crontab options
04:54  Soopaman: I can literally build out all of the selectors, but even in my simple test case, I have 100 selectors in my element collector
04:54  Soopaman: does anyone have any ideas for being a lot more efficient using selectors that can group?
04:55  Soopaman: ie a ":nth-if-type(2,3,10-15)" ?
05:00  dizabled: pneftali:  can you put the code in a jsfiddle?
05:08  gnarf: Soopaman: confused
05:17  Soopaman: gnarf, nevermind, think i overcomplicated the issue
05:17  Soopaman: what would be the properway to get the "margin-left" value of an element?
05:17  SugaSlide: .css("margin-left")
05:17  SugaSlide: or work out its position
05:18  Soopaman: awesome, thx
05:21  danheberden: or .css({ marginLeft: '10px' }) if you're using an object
05:22  SugaSlide: thats setting the margin

05:34  danheberden: ?ud wanksta
05:34  bot-t: danheberden, wanksta - A "wanksta" is a very basic word meaning a person who acts/looks like a gangster or thug, but has never done anything gangster or thug-like besides acting or looking like one. It can be towards any race or ethnicity. The word does NOT imply a WHITE guy acting black.
05:35  danheberden: thank you, bot-t

05:35  ocf: whats ud? was hoping it was urban dictionary
05:35  danheberden: it is
05:35  ocf: ?ud sweet dud
05:35  bot-t: ocf, Sweet Dud - Sweet Dud is a response used to show complete an utter contempt for whatever anyone else throws at you. Whether it's critically important, or silly in nature, Sweet Dud is an appropriate response for all. You can add dripping contempt by including contemptuous facial expressions (e.g. raise the eyebrows slightly, throw in a smirk, and quasi-chuckle), extending your arm 90 degrees from your body, and extending your hand at 4...

07:37  ocf: I'm trying to use prettyPhoto for youtube lightbox. I've used it successfully on other sites. I just pulled in the code to another one, but when I click the link it redirects to youtube.

07:37  ocf: http://social.scottsilvi.com/dashboard/beta/nike is the URL, if anyone has any thoughts on how I can troubleshoot this

07:56  coldhead: not really, Aquaguy
07:56  coldhead: not "as such"
07:56  coldhead: it's able to set post variables, and fling them at the server
07:57  coldhead: but it's the server what does the READING so to speeeeak

07:59  Aquaguy: mm maybe you can give me an idea... maybe with an XHR... I have < ul> with usernames listed in it as <li> elements, each <li> element has a value (the user's id). I've blinded a click event to the <li> elements so when you click on them it calls a .php file that gets info from the database. Now I want to put that data in the form fields nex to the list of users, how can I do it?
07:59  coldhead: lol blinded
08:00  ocf: coldhead - what I can't figure out is why it works on one site and not another. If I take the youtube link off this site, firebug it into the working site, it works fine. and ultimately thats what I'm selecting :-|
08:00  coldhead: Aquaguy: in the success handler for the .post() request or .ajax() request
08:00  ocf: doesn't sound very bug-like
08:00  coldhead: ?post @ Aquaguy
08:00  bot-t: Aquaguy, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
08:01  coldhead: ocf: you're not trying to do cross domain ajax are you?
08:02  ocf: no I don't think so. afaik it just takes the link and embeds it in an iframe, displays in a lightbox
08:03  ocf: so it dynamically builds the youtube embed code
08:03  doonie: paul_irish-m make w3 parser accept your X-UA-Compatible meta tag <3

08:21  Aquaguy: Hello again
08:21  Aquaguy: http://pastebin.com/QrgZg3Ln
08:21  Aquaguy: When outputing $(this).val() to the console I get an error
08:22  Aquaguy: Uncaught TypeError: Object 20201 has no method 'replace
08:22  Aquaguy: What is that? how can I solve it?
08:22  dizabled: change it to $(this).text()
08:22  msafi: The scroll does not run away when I simply use .css() and not .animate().
08:23  mekwall: msafi: where's the code?
08:23  msafi: http://winkpress.com/wp-content/themes/winkpress/includes/demo-image.js
08:24  Aquaguy: [dizabled] but im trying to get the value attribute of the li
08:24  dizabled: Aquaguy:  from http://api.jquery.com/val, "The .val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements."
08:24  msafi: mekwall, example here: http://winkpress.com/test-scrollbar/
08:24  mekwall: ...
08:24  dizabled: Aquaguy:  there is no value attribute of which I'm aware
08:24  mekwall: msafi: and you think I'm going to run through all of your wp code?
08:24  dizabled: Aquaguy:  however, to get an attribute, you would do that like this: $(this).attr("id")
08:25  mekwall: msafi: take it out of the site and setup a test case @ jsfiddle
08:25  dizabled: which would give you the id of that li
08:25  mekwall: ?p @ msafi
08:25  bot-t: msafi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
08:25  Aquaguy: [dizabled] dreamweaver suggested me the attribute I was going to use id instead
08:25  Aquaguy: but as id cannot start by a number...
08:25  msafi: mekwall, what WP code? It's a small JS file, demo-image.js
08:25  Aquaguy: I decided to go ahead with value=""
08:25  ocf: Anyone able to explain how I can troubleshoot this? I'm using prettyPhoto plugin to launch a lightbox which displays youtube videos in the lightbox. It works on other sites. firebug shows my js & css is being pulled in, and no js errors in console. its the last javascript file at the bottom of body. That selector returns a length of 20, so I know the selector is right, but it doesn't appear
08:25  ocf: the prettyPhoto() method is firing. http://social.scottsilvi.com/dashboard/beta/nike
08:25  mekwall: Aquaguy: you might not want to use [] around nicknames, becuase that will prevent certain highlighters not to trigger :)
08:26  mekwall: msafi: and how the hell would I know that?
08:26  gnarf: ocf: lots of console.log / debugger statements?
08:26  mekwall: msafi: still, take it out of the site and put it on jsfiddle
08:26  dizabled: Aquaguy:  you could use title
08:26  Aquaguy: mmmm let me change it if i can find the setting
08:26  xotix: hi
08:26  Aquaguy: [dizabled] title is shown when the user hovers the element
08:27  dizabled: indeed
08:27  xotix: i have a jquery ui dialog, opened via clicking a link. it doesnt work in ie, why? dont rly have an error or something.
08:27  ocf: where do I put them? in the plugin?
08:27  dizabled: Aquaguy:  "value" is deprecated on li's
08:28  Aquaguy: stupid adobe, stupid me lol
08:28  dizabled: Aquaguy:  what information are you storing there?
08:28  Aquaguy: the id number of the user
08:28  Aquaguy: dizabled
08:28  Aquaguy: no brackets! lol
08:29  ocf: gnarf: and how do I test that? When I click the link, the page redirects. firebugs persist doesn't seem to work across pages
08:30  gnarf: its not going to navigate away in a breakpoint
08:30  Aquaguy: console.log($(this).attr('id').split('user_')[1]);
08:30  gnarf: if you can break early on the click event and browse around/whatevs
08:30  Aquaguy: that works, any better way of doing it?
08:30  gnarf: Aquaguy: yes
08:30  gnarf: :)
08:30  gnarf: this.id = faster and shorter
08:31  gnarf: personally - i prefer matching using RE
08:31  gnarf: but its not a one liner
08:31  msafi: mekwall, http://jsfiddle.net/hdXmB/
08:31  Aquaguy: great! thank you gnarf
08:31  dizabled: gnarf: his value is an int, though
08:31  gnarf: if (var match = this.id.match(/user_(\d+)/)) { userId = match[1] }
08:32  msafi: mekwall, and thanks for jsfiddle.com
08:32  dizabled: oh, I see what you meant
08:32  msafi: .net*
08:33  mekwall: msafi: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/hdXmB/1/
08:33  mekwall: solved
08:33  mekwall: msafi: np! sorry for being a bit grumpy, haven't got my first cup of coffee yet ;)
08:34  msafi: mekwall, it's okay. I'll go read what stop() does. Thanks a lot.
08:34  mekwall: msafi: notice how I switched events from mouseover/mouseout to mouseenter/mouseleave
08:34  mekwall: ?.stop @ msafi
08:34  bot-t: msafi, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
08:34  ocf: gnarf - I added a breakpoint to the first line of the plugin. When I click the link, it still redirected to youtube, which means the plugin never fired. I'm not sure how to proceed :|
08:34  mekwall: msafi: it clears the animation queue and jumps directly to the end of the animation
08:35  mekwall: msafi: your previous code queued the animations so they stacked if you moved in/out faster then the animations could finish
08:35  xotix: it works now. but if the dialog is opened  i get a vertical scrollbar in the browser window, why?
08:35  msafi: mekwall, oh okay, that makes sense
08:36  mekwall: msafi: also I'd use some kind of delay on the mouseleave handler
08:37  msafi: good idea
08:37  SlexAxton: gnarf: i had justin meyer send you a link to the chicago meetup
08:37  SlexAxton: go to it

11:51  Aquaguy: how do I call them
11:51  brux: sean`: Not sure what happened there, what I meant was I want the scripts to be loaded and executed normally. I was thinking of loading it within an iframe, but thought that it would be easier to load it within a div so that I can get access the objects from the parent and vice-a-versa
11:51  Aquaguy: let's say a method called doSomething
11:51  gnarf: Aquaguy: .selectmenu('doSomething')
11:52  gnarf: i think
11:52  gnarf: thats the general ui pattern
11:52  Aquaguy: gnarf and If you want to pass a variable to that method?
11:52  gnarf: , variable
11:53  gnarf: if the function is on the widget itself
11:53  gnarf: tha
11:53  gnarf: ts
11:53  gnarf: usua
11:53  gnarf: lly
11:53  gnarf: woah
11:53  gnarf: crazy keys
11:53  gnarf: i think that one stores itself as .data('selectmenu') too
11:54  gnarf: but the methods in the docs will be .selectmenu(methodName, value)
11:59  brux: sean`: Ok thanks I've got it now, I made a mistake with it. I was using firebug to see what had happened to the page and couldn't see where it had loaded the JS that was in the <script>. But it is there... inline

13:56  mekwall: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete <-- interesting ... if I throw the example in jsfiddle it doesn't work
13:56  mekwall: I have to do $("#example").autocomplete({ source: data });
13:57  fris: mekwall well autocomplete is based off a php script or some other way of grabbing the data
13:58  mekwall: it's not
13:58  fris: how are you doing the data for the autocomplete then
13:58  mekwall: take a look again, and you'll notice that it's using a VERY outdated code
13:58  mekwall: fris: like the example?
13:59  mekwall: var data = "bleh blah test goo".split(" ");
13:59  Altreus: offset() returns { left: 0, top: 0 } in chrome and a ClientRect in Firefox. Is this normal?
13:59  fris: ya data is defined
13:59  Altreus: cos the code assumes a plain object
13:59  fris: i never used that autocomplete plugin
14:00  mekwall: Altreus: I guess jQuery uses ClientRect in Firefox because it's faster
14:01  mekwall: Altreus: as long as left and top is accessible just as if you were to access a plain object it doesn't really matter
14:02  fris: that reminds me i need to implement autocomplete into this code today
14:04  Bartzy: How come '&' becomes &amp; in alert() ?
14:07  fris: mekwall http://www.thewhyandthehow.com/jquery-autocomplete/ here is an example of putting the data right in the ()
14:08  mekwall: fris: it's outdated and wrong
14:09  mekwall: posted april 2009 and uses jquery ui 1.7.1
14:09  fris: found one that uses jquery 1.4 from dec 2010
14:10  fris: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-autocomplete/
14:10  mekwall: that's not jquery ui autocomplete :)
14:11  fris: oh you wanna use ui
14:11  mekwall: fris: no, I don't want anything... I was just pointing out that the docs for ui autocomplete is wrong and outdated :) lol
14:11  fris: ahh ok thought you were looking for a solution

14:22  ManxPower: I see some docs that reference $.fn.media.mapFormat('wav', 'winmedia');  should $.fn be '$('mydiv')' to specify the object I want to apply the option to?
14:23  mekwall: ManxPower: correct
14:23  ManxPower: mekwall, thanks.  Now I know why it wasn't working. 8-|
14:24  mekwall: ;)
14:24  jomofcw: OK peol thanks for information
14:25  ManxPower: still isn't working 8-(  Does anyone here have experience with the jQuery Media plugin?  It defaults to using quicktime to play .wav files, I'm trying to tell it to use WMP.
14:27  ManxPower: It seems to insist on using quicktime.  I have:   $('#voice-message').media.mapFormat('wav', 'winmedia');  $('#voice-message').media();
14:28  mekwall: $.fn.media.mapFormat('wav','winmedia');
14:28  mekwall: according to the docs
14:28  mekwall: that's how you do it
14:28  Bartzy: anyone came across a problem in FF (3.6.6) where <a> links that are display:block are becoming a white box when clicked ?
14:28  ManxPower: mekwall, I was using that when I asked my question earlier.
14:28  mekwall: ManxPower: disregard what I said earlier about you being correct... I thought you asked a general question abour $.fn :)
14:29  ManxPower: $.fn.media.mapFormat('wav', 'winmedia');  $('#voice-message').media(); I just switched it back, and it seem to be still trying to use quicktime.
14:30  mekwall: ManxPower: then it's not working properly
14:30  mekwall: so I'd recommend you to contact the dev
14:30  ManxPower: mekwall, I know 8-(  I'm trying to figure out why.
14:31  mekwall: http://jquery.malsup.com/media/#faq
14:31  ManxPower: it seems to be the most popular media plugin.
14:31  mekwall: it's even stated in the FAQ :p
14:31  mekwall: Use the mapFormat method. The following example remaps the wav file format to use the Windows Media Player instead of Quicktime: :p
14:32  ManxPower: From the faq, it seems like I have to do this: $.fn.media.mapFormat('wav', 'winmedia')
14:32  ManxPower: I guess I should embed it directly instead of messing with JS plugins.
14:32  mekwall: yup

14:36  Clonix: or .parents("li:first"), no?
14:36  erichynds: closest is more effecient
14:36  Clonix: good to know :)
14:36  erichynds: efficient*
14:36  taf2:  why?
14:36  Qci: thansk i wil ltry
14:37  erichynds: because closest is one of those often used internal methods that is highly optimized
14:37  erichynds: and it stops when it hits a match
14:37  erichynds: whereas parents continues all the way up the DOM
14:37  taf2: thanks that makes sense
14:40  mekwall: parents look for more then one element, and thus continues to walk the dom
14:40  mekwall: closests on look for one
14:40  mekwall: closest*
14:40  mekwall: woot
14:40  mekwall: only!
14:40  mekwall: I'm having a brain freeze
14:41  taf2: does closest look in both directions within the DOM?   e.g.   up and down?
14:41  mekwall: nope
14:41  mekwall: only up
14:41  taf2:  <div><li>up</li><div id="search-from-here"><li>down</li></div>

14:44  JKarsrud: jquery ui dialog?
14:44  JKarsrud: Depends on what kind of modal you need?
14:44  JKarsrud: fancybox?
14:44  schweizer: i need the kind where the whole site is darkened and the user can click nothing except the modal window's close button
14:45  JKarsrud: like a fancybox?
14:45  JKarsrud: uhm, like fancybox*
14:45  schweizer: yes like that
14:45  felcom: If you already load jquery UI use the one built in with that, otheriwse fancybox i think is pretty popular, yeah
14:45  JKarsrud: then use that
14:45  JKarsrud: thickbox pollutes the global namespace like nothing you've ever seen, so please use fancybox :P
14:45  schweizer: is that better then thickbox and/or jquery ui?
14:46  JKarsrud: better than thickbox, jquery ui is more for dialogs

14:49  jorn: heyho, when i use the fx queue of an jquery object and do something like this: myobj..queue(function(next) {setTimeout(function() {next();}, 15000);});, what happens when i do a myobj.clearQueue(); while the first element is "waiting"?
14:49  jorn: s/.././
14:51  jorn: and what if i add a couple of other functions in between... is there a chance of 2 next calls at the same time (think of ajax calls which are added to the queue)
14:52  JKarsrud: mekwall: Hahaha
14:52  mekwall: <3
14:54  mekwall: jorn: I'm quite sure that next will just be a noop
14:54  doonie: 90 = nop!
14:54  mekwall: I believe that jQuery will replace all the queued functions with the noop function so it doesn't error out if cleared
14:55  jorn: mekwall: the fx queue has autostarting...
14:55  mekwall: I guess we need to try it out :D
14:56  jorn: (already on it)
14:56  mekwall: jsfiddle?
14:56  felcom: Is http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ still the de facto standard for form validation or does anyone have another better suggestion?

14:56  jorn: mekwall: well, worth an idea
14:56  mekwall: felcom: I vote against advanced validation client side
14:57  felcom: why?
14:57  mekwall: felcom: you'll still have to validate the data server-side so why waste time on implementing on both sides? :)
14:57  squeek: stop them in their tracks.
14:57  mekwall: felcom: I only do basic validation, such as if the field is empty but required etc.
14:57  felcom: this is true, our backend validation is already in place
14:57  felcom: yeah ok, i'll take that approach, it makes more sense, thanks
14:58  felcom: i'll be using html5 + polyfills so i'll just utilize the email types on forms
14:58  felcom: or stuff like that
14:58  mekwall: felcom: jquery validation is too bulky and have only given me headaches :)
14:58  felcom: for*

15:10  mekwall: felcom: I'm getting there ;)
15:10  Cork: (as dom objects)
15:10  felcom: right now I'm working with something I wrote that pops up a tooltip with user info & links so I'll need something that supports that as well
15:10  mekwall: Cork: like attaching svg to canvas?
15:10  developerhealey: !seen
15:10  felcom: kinda like the 'sticky' tooltip but closes after a certain interval instead of requiring a click
15:11  Cork: mekwall: well primary appending it straight into dom (html5) or canvas
15:11  Cork: both are interesting
15:12  Cork: mekwall: the senario is that i'll have svg images that i will overlay each other, and they need to be clickable/modifiable and so on
15:13  Cork: (resizable, draggable, change color and so on)
15:13  mekwall: Cork: $.get('svg.tests.svg', function(data) { svg.add(data); }); kinda
15:13  mekwall: well with the http://keith-wood.name/svg.html ofc
15:14  mekwall: Cork: dataType is xml btw
15:14  Cork: mekwall: that i was wondering about is; do i need to take care of doctypes or things like that when i append it to the dom?
15:15  mekwall: depends on how you append it I guess
15:16  Cork: something like $.ajax({ url: '/file.svg', success: function(data) { div.append(data); }});
15:16  mekwall: Cork: http://keith-wood.name/svg.html <--- check the Load tab
15:16  mekwall: Cork:  you can't append it like that
15:16  Cork: i suspected as much :)
15:16  mekwall: use Keith Woods plugin :)
15:16  Cork: i need to pars out each dom?
15:17  mekwall: no reason to reinvent the wheel
15:17  mekwall: var svg = $('#svgload').svg('get'); svg.load($('#loadURL').val(), {addTo: $('#addTo')[0].checked,
15:17  mekwall: changeSize: false, onLoad: loadDone});

15:31  Yettie: but this one $(this).parent().select();	no function
15:31  schweizer: i'm using the jquery ui dialog window to show a modal window but the window is not modal. what could be the reason for this?
15:33  Aamir: schweizer:  there is an option for that: modal:true

15:34  Xtracted: goooood moooorniiing!
15:35  Aamir: schweizer:  inspect in firebug and check if the second last div at the bottom of document is modal div? may be you have a problem with z-index
15:35  Xtracted: I am trying to build a function that handles the left padding for an unordered list with jquery... anyone who could give me a few ideas?
15:35  Yettie: so if .select() will function, the whole row will be blue
15:35  Aamir: Yettie: select a row?
15:36  Yettie: Aamir, yes a table row

15:38  Kasreyn: using jQuery UI tabs the dataTables column headers vanish or isn't updated when switching to tab2. anyone know how it can be fixed?
15:38  Aamir: Yettie:  You cannot just select a whole row and copy it. You have to do something like   $('tr.tableRow td ').each(function(){    console.log($(this).html())      })

16:01  oste: why does the form still submit?
16:02  Altreus: you didn't return false
16:02  Altreus: you disable the submit button after it's been clicked Too late!
16:02 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
16:02  Altreus: You have to return false to stop that happening.
16:02  oste: where do i return false?
16:02  Altreus: in the submit function
16:02  oste: tried it, doesnt work
16:03  Altreus: how about e.preventDefault() ?
16:03  hauni: thx
16:03  Altreus: I think that's the method. You have to accept the e, like function(e) {
16:03  oste: that doesnt work
16:04  Altreus: http://api.jquery.com/submit/  # the docs say both of these work
16:04  Altreus: something else is wrong
16:04  Aamir: oste:  you need a submit button, only than it will work (i think)
16:04  Altreus: oste: your JS is not finished. You missed a );
16:04  oste: i do have a submit button
16:04  Aamir: ahh
16:05  Altreus: therefore it is not run ;)
16:05  oste: ah ha
16:05  Altreus: yep that fixed it
16:06  sean`: wwwwwatf
16:08  sean`: this is incredible

16:12  nikhatzi: hello people. can i update a php function using jquery?
16:13  bischjer: how do you know which element your mouse is hovering above?
16:14  abracsi: nikhatzi, that sounds like a strange thing to do. perhaps give more detail about your problem if you would like someone to help
16:14  abracsi: bischjer. that is harder that you'd think
16:15  nikhatzi: ok, listen. i want to play with jquery. i have a shell_exec php function to print me the output of netstat command in linux. i want to refresh the php output function in the site without having to refresh the whole page, but be able to update the php output
16:15  abracsi: bischer, if dealing with simple objects,  that you know where they are, you can do maths
16:15  abracsi: bischer, else keep track of it over certain objects by keeping a reference to the last hovered object
16:16  abracsi: nikhatzi, it sounds like you want to make an ajax call
16:17  nikhatzi: so it can't be done with jquery... hm... thnx
16:17  abracsi: look up ajax in the api, and assess whether this helps you get what you want
16:17  nikhatzi: thanks a lot :)
16:17  abracsi: yes, jquery has a great ajax function
16:17  nikhatzi: ok :)
16:23  abracsi: if you have a chained jQuery set of instructions, that animate various things. it would be nice to see what jQuery has selected at each point. what's the best way to do this?
16:24  abracsi: is there some sort of inspect function?
16:24  Michael: You can override $.find and have it log its current selector
16:25  abracsi: and then insert that between each instruction

16:29  manster: anyone here used the ui selectmenu?
16:30  manster: I want to know how to choose where it pops up
16:30  eni23: hello at all. this is make me crazy: i got a list with divs. some are visible and some not. now i have a object wit an div, how can i get the next visible?
16:31  eni23: should be easy
16:31  RTPMatt: add :visible ?
16:32  eni23: object.next(":visible") does not work
16:34  russinkungen: ?next()
16:34  bot-t: .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
16:34  russinkungen: $()
16:34  seyDoggy: is there a trick to getting this to be true? http://pastie.org/1445418
16:36  cohitre: seyDoggy: why are you trying to do that?
16:36  seyDoggy: cohitre: I need to test for users chosen font size
16:37  cohitre: why?
16:37  cohitre: it seems like you will end up testing for a bunch of different values
16:37  seyDoggy: cohitre: because I need to dynamically adjust other things depending on the font size the user has chosen.
16:37  cohitre: you can do that with CSS
16:37  cohitre: and ems
16:38  cohitre: when you use em as a unit things are scaled according to the font-size.
16:38  seyDoggy: cohitre: this is for a CMS, please just trust that I know what I am doing here
16:38  RTPMatt:  eni23: im not sure how you are doing it.  maybe something like $(list).slice(numberOfCurrentOne).filder(':visible').eg(0) ?
16:38  cohitre: i don't trust you.
16:39  cohitre: so i'll shut my mouth now.
16:39  bischjer: I'm trying to add a mouseover callback to a jqueryui widget. But I can't seem to be able to pass a staticish string they are dynamically referenced to the last item
16:39  seyDoggy: cohitre: I build templates, font size is an option, set globally by %, which in turn effects the em's throughout the css
16:40  seyDoggy: cohitre: for other purposes, I need to know what the user has chosen
16:40  ajpiano: can't you pick that up from wherever in the app the user sets that option
16:41  seyDoggy: ajpiano: no, sadly.
16:41  eni23: ﻿RTPMatt:  the problem is i don't got a currentNumber, only an object
16:42  RTPMatt: eni23: but you have the list of all of the elements?
16:42  russinkungen: eni23: http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/ <-- Elements with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0 are considered to be visible, since they still consume space in the layout.
16:43  russinkungen: display: none works however
16:44  eni23: this is my code to get next visible (no=nextObject): if (!no.is(":visible")){ var x=false; while (x==false){ no=no.next(); if (no.is(":visible")) { x=true; } } }
16:44  eni23: works great but if it's the last visible and there are some hidden divs it crashes the browser
16:45  ajpiano: eni23: .nextAll(":visible:first");
16:46  russinkungen: hmm
16:47  chovy: :near-bottom
16:47  russinkungen: <div id="foo">asd</div><div style="display:none;">asd</div><div>asd</div> -> $('#foo').next(':visible') returns empty array... nextAll works though.
16:47  russinkungen: Is that because .next is not visible? :)
16:48  mekwall: russinkungen: yes
16:48  chovy: $("#foo el:visible:first").whatever();
16:48  mekwall: russinkungen: .next will only check the next element
16:48  mekwall: it doesn't look for the next element based on the selector
16:48  seyDoggy: maybe this explains it better: http://pastie.org/1445446
16:48  mekwall: the selector is only meant to filter the result of the .next
16:49  peol: Yeah, just to make sure you're given the element you think you're given.
16:49  russinkungen: mekwall: ok, thought it enumerated the dom-siblings until it found an element which matches the selector.
16:49  mekwall: .next(':visible') is kinda the same as .next().filter(':visible')
16:50  eni23: this does the trick: var next=obj.nextAll(":visible").eq(0)
16:50  mekwall: russinkungen: nope, that's what .nextAll is for :)
16:50  eni23: thanks @ all for helping
16:50  mekwall: eni23: even better: var next=obj.nextAll(":visible:first")[0];
16:50  Kasreyn: Aamir: commented out this for my dataTable and now the header has the right size automaticly, sScrollX": "100%", "sScrollXInner": "100%"
16:51  Kasreyn: scrollbar doesn't work inside jQuery UI tabs for some reason
16:51  mekwall: eni23: well, use .eq if you need a jQuery object
16:51  Kasreyn: well it works but other parts of the table has visual bugs
16:51  mekwall: eni23: disregard that, only do var next=obj.nextAll(":visible:first"); just as ajpiano said earlier

17:15  aca20031: http://pastebin.com/ecVCkUTX Take a look at the getJSON(). Based on the accordion  (http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/) I expected this to work, using <h3></h3> as the header and everything inside the <div> below it as the body, but in practice it makes my data[x].name (test name) the header for the first one, which is good, but then it makes "There ar eno open session windows for this test"
17:15  aca20031: the header of the second one, not the body of the first one. From then its all fucked

17:26  ldexterldesign: how are people deploying modernizr declarations:
17:26  ldexterldesign: .multiplebgs div p {
17:26  ldexterldesign:   /* properties for browsers that
17:26  ldexterldesign:      support multiple backgrounds */
17:26  ldexterldesign: }
17:26  ldexterldesign: .no-multiplebgs div p {
17:26  ldexterldesign:   /* optional fallback properties
17:26  ldexterldesign:      for browsers that don't */
17:26  ldexterldesign: }
17:26  ldexterldesign: which one do you choose???
17:27  ldexterldesign: the exceptions or the progressives?
17:28  timmywil: Exceptions, simply because the exceptions are usually longer selectors
17:28  felcom: i'd say the exceptions
17:29  felcom: also, eventually you'll be able to remove that code and have smaller files
17:29  felcom: in like 10 years....but still
17:31  Soopaman: isn't it always best to write to your lowest common demoninator and then physically include any enhancements?
17:31  felcom: not really
17:32  felcom: because then as time goes on you have to add more and more code
17:33  Soopaman: could you elaborate with a scenario?
17:33  felcom: ok so
17:33  Soopaman: assuming you are coding  to a SOW
17:33  abracsi: anyone found that a selector may not work on a span when the span contians a question mark, or potentially other punctuation symbols?
17:33  felcom: right now it's smarter to write an html5 app and use polyfills to retrofit support
17:34  felcom: so as time goes on theoretically you're removing fills instead of piling them on
17:35  felcom: it obv depends on what you're making
17:36  felcom: but i think it's smarter to write future-proof code
17:36  felcom: we're in a transition period which makes that possible being that html5 is partially supported
17:37  Soopaman: aside from modernizr, are there any other normalizing frameworks?

17:41  jorn: hey folks, i have a problem with jquery and ajax... my server requires that one user has at most one concurrent ajax request in whatever state (which get's quite complicated).
17:41  jorn: i though i could just use the ajax serialization approach mentioned in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3034874/sequencing-ajax-requests/3035268#3035268
17:42  jorn: but now i also need a "pingback", so the client shall call back to the server every 5 seconds to detect timeouts
17:42  jorn: i thought "ok, let's just add a waiter to the queue"
17:43  jorn: but waiting with a timeout and then calling next doesn't seem to cooperate with clearQueue as here: http://jsfiddle.net/GXaEN/8/

18:01  HM2K: you're using their CDN
18:01  DaveJ|UK: its a google maps app so it will always be online

18:04  erichynds: emanu, test the length.  if it's > 1, run code
18:05  erichynds: do logic at the point where the div enters the DOM
18:05  felcom: or if($('grid').hasClass('load-keyboard-shortcuts')) {  }
18:05  emanu: erichynds: yea, but it's always going to fail. I need to do something like $('div#grid.load-keyboard-shortcuts').live('when_exists',function() { ... do stuff ...});  You follow?

18:05  DaveJ|UK: Is there an externally hosted version of jquery lightbox?
18:06  DaveJ|UK: only found ui on google code

18:07  erichynds: also, ditch the "div" part of "div#" in your selector
18:08  emanu: erichynds: yea, I guess I could do it on my ajax callback, but there's no way to run some code when an element pops up via something like live()?

18:46  Aquaguy: I'm using ui widget selectmenu I've added a custom method that it works, but now I want to trigger a change event, how can I do it?
18:46  Amit: erichynds, thanks. It changed the class when I hover the mouse over the button with following code.
18:46  Amit: $(document).ready(function() { 		$('.mylink').hover(function() { this.className = 'mylinkhover'; }); });
18:47  Amit: But now when I mouseout, it does not change to previous className. Do you know how to revert back to previous class when on mouseout?
18:48  Aquaguy: Amit hover classes names usually arent replaced but added and removed
18:49  phedhex: $(document).ready(function() {hover code}, function() {unhover code} )
18:49  erichynds: no
18:49  erichynds: ?hover @ Amit
18:49  bot-t: Amit, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
18:49  Amit: so is there a other function to change the class on mousemove and mouseover and when mouseout revert back to same class
18:50  Amit: bot-t, does this mean that handlerIn is the first class name and handlerOut is second class name?
18:50  bot-t: Amit, Very doubtful.
18:50  Amit: bot-t, I am very novice that's the reason.

19:33  ajpiano: people have jobs, etc.
19:34  felcom: $("#container p:nth-child(2)") as well
19:34  Getty: ajpiano: compared to what? you are talking as if that is normal for a 100< people "free support channel"
19:34  ajpiano: Getty: i'm just not sure why you're stirring this up for no particular reason?
19:35  wontoner: Hmm.. are there paid support channels?
19:35  Getty: ajpiano: i hit the channel by mistake, and saw the no activity and then saw that we are now at 790 users already
19:35  ajpiano: there are people that help here regularly, and there are a tonne of idlers because it's a popular project, i don't really understand the qualms
19:35  ajpiano: yeah,
19:35  ajpiano: the average idlers quantity has gone up by a lot
19:35  ajpiano: over time
19:35  Getty: yeah and that has a reason, but its ok ;) dont wanna discuss that

19:37  JKarsrud1: ajpiano: sweet *looking*
19:37  mongag: Yes but what if I have something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ZfCm2/1/  How to select lets say third children If i don`t now what kind of tags #container contains ?
19:38  naton: .children(':eq(2)') ?
19:39  ajpiano: Getty: what is "silver tablet" support??
19:39  Getty: ajpiano: answering every question as perfect as possible without questioning it
19:39  crankharder: both firebug and chrome debugger show that an element has width of "675px" (defined in a stylesheet) - but width() on that element is returning "674px", no matter what i change the stylesheet width() is always 1 pixel smaller -- anyone seen something like that?
19:39  Getty: when we had 50 people here, we regulary had "move your own ass"-support which was just pointing, and not proxy the information
19:40  mnuss: whoops... i spelled dataType wrong. that would do it.
19:40  mnuss: never mind!
19:40  ajpiano: Getty, well, now we have the bot... so we are just pointing, it's just a better point.
19:40  naton: mongag: did that work for you?
19:41  Getty: ajpiano: yeah, point directly to the solution, dont let the user question himself ;)
19:42  mongag: naton: Just a second, I`m trying
19:42  ajpiano: telling people "figure it out" is not a support strategy.
19:42  ajpiano: Getty, sometimes i also tell people, just figure it out
19:42  Getty: ajpiano: there are more options in between :)
19:42  ajpiano: but there's nothing wrong with providing some guidance.
19:42  ajpiano: i know.
19:42  Aquaguy: I'm editing a jquery.ui plugin... I want to add a event trigger but dont know how to do it. This plugin changes the value of an <input> when the value in the widget has changed. What i want to do now is add the reverse functionality, if the user changes the <input> value, change the value in the widget too.
19:42  Getty: ajpiano: i just wonder, we could have a decent culture here, we had more activity with the 50 users in the old days
19:43  ajpiano: Getty: i really don't think we have a culture problem in here, but that's just me
19:43  Aquaguy: Any ideas? 'this' is the widget, and 'this'.element the original input element
19:43  Getty: ajpiano: i miss giving support together with nlogax on our own special way hehe ;)
19:43  Getty: ajpiano: yeah, its always more a point of view
19:43  ajpiano: Getty: it's a lot harder to support hundreds of comers and goers with a very different amount of skill
19:43  Getty: ajpiano: i'm irc junk, 52 channels and an own display dedicated to IRC ;)
19:43  Getty: ajpiano: i know, do this on other channels just fine
19:44  Getty: ajpiano: here it was blocked, cause i was never able to find out the skill of the people, they directly had a silver tablet
19:44  mongag: naton: I think not. Check it here http://jsfiddle.net/jTLR2/
19:44  Getty: especially by you ;)
19:44  Aquaguy: anyone, please?
19:45  felcom: Getty: those that want to learn will learn regarless of how you help them
19:45  felcom: people come for help, they should receive it
19:45  Aquaguy: something like this.element.onchange('someMethodName');
19:45  Aquaguy: that's not the correct sintax
19:45  Aquaguy: but I dont know the correct one
19:45  Getty: felcom: yes and no, i had the experience (also personal on my own), that you can push them into that direction so that they learn faster and try to avoid the questions or think different about the themes
19:45  naton: mongag: you forgot the ":"
19:46  Getty: felcom: the experienced user should try to bring over the experience, not the technology
19:46  naton: mongag: http://jsfiddle.net/jTLR2/3/
19:46  Getty: ESPECIALLY on the javascript sector, its an art to make a good JS code design, just solving the problem is not always a good idea
19:46  ThomK: Hi folks. :) Got problem with IE. I'm trying to change bg color of children when I hover element. I'm binding that to hover: $(this).find('div').css('background-color', '#659ab6'); but on IE background color is changed in (this) too. On other browsers it works as I need.
19:47  felcom: Getty: Well, honestly I dont expect to learn how to write good JS from an IRC channel
19:47  Aquaguy: anyone?
19:47  mongag: naton: thanks
19:47  naton: ThomK: i'd use div:hover (or similar) using CSS there
19:47  Getty: felcom: hehehe, thats your opinion. I learned many stuff on many sectors by talking with the right guys on the right channel
19:48  Getty: felcom: for example on #ape-project we are so not giving one line of "ready to go", nothing there is event very "here thats how it goes", we are totally digging in the air, but people learn, we spread lots of experience

21:12  ngharo: tcatm: why bother with the jquery selector at all if your element has an ID
21:12  ngharo: assuming you don't need the jquery object
21:12  tcatm: I thought it might be faster if it doesn't have to scan the whole DOM
21:13  stalecache: diamonds, if the anchor isn't visible when the fixed header is removed... you could try CSS on the anchor element position:relative;top:100px;
21:13  ngharo: tcatm: doubtful but maybe worth benchmarking
21:14  diamonds: stalecache: ty will try
21:14  stalecache: diamonds, also, you don't have to have <a> for an #anchor to work... you could just add an ID attribute to any element and #ID will work

21:33  cssguru: Like $('body').animate({ backgroundColor: })
21:34  cssguru: '#000000'
21:34  daniel__: what i am however missing in the plugin authoring documentation is core features i would expect to be offered by jQuery rather than implementing it in the plugin itself.
21:35  cssguru: I've included the jqueryui.js as well and no dice, the only plugin I was able to get it semi working was John Resig's personal jQuery.color.js file but only supports 1.2
21:35  daniel__: one example: i would like to limit a plugin being only callable on compatible objects.
21:36  goose84: Does anyone know of an example of something like http://demo.webdeveloperplus.com/dynamic-scrollbox/ but with a css style scroll bar
21:36  daniel__: lets say tables, (e.g. $("table").myPlugin() should work fine where as $("div").myPlugin() should behave like if the plugin doesn't exist).

22:14  theotherguy: can i target browsers using modernizr?
22:14  serio: no, but you can with jQuery
22:14  theotherguy: modernizr dsnt add classed according to the brower?
22:14  theotherguy: classes
22:14  serio: modernizr is about targetting features, not browsers
22:15 * ejo sighs
22:15  theotherguy: uhmm
22:15  blub3k: somehow that does not work. i am loading an "accordion" <div id="accordion>" but when i put the <script> part in the loaded file it does not work.
22:15  ravenzz: Diana888 if that is an third party script you should looking for an update, a fixed one maybe
22:16  magnus_: hey. if i have a div that is suppose to show whenever the user checks a checkbox in a form, what is the perferred way of hiding it initially? just set the default CSS to hidden, and then have jQuery show/hide it on the .change() event?
22:18  Diana888: Thank you, I'll find out.
22:18  serio: ajpiano: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide46
22:19  serio: did you just arbitrarily add that concatenation on that var?
22:19  serio: or, was this an actual jsFiddle...
22:19  serio: either way, that made me lol
22:19  timmywil: blub3k, put up some code on jsfiddle.net
22:21  timmywil: illmatix, so the link text is going to two lines only by wrapping?
22:22  illmatix: timmywil: yes. And by wrapping jquery doesn't get the proper height value. It only returns the height of the single line of text.
22:23  illmatix: timmywil: basically trying to align a second-level drop down to its parent drop down
22:23  timmywil: i see
22:23 --- 92AAB4LZ6 is now known as dr4g
22:25  illmatix: timmywil: let me check in my work adn see if i can show you what i have done.
22:26  blub3k: timmywil: u can see the whole code. i have a redmine page for it. the project is not a secret. it is for the univerity.
22:26  timmywil: illmatix, got it
22:27  timmywil: you're only getting the height of the first one
22:27  timmywil: you need an each
22:27  timmywil: see the log http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/SsZ2v/
22:28  illmatix: timmywil: ahh i'll try that.
22:29  blub3k: timmywil: i have send you some links in qry
22:31  illmatix: timmywil: so i want to loop through all of my level1 items adn get the height?
22:32 --- Chris____ is now known as k1t
22:32  timmywil: illmatix, yea, you'll have to go through each link individually
22:33  illmatix: timmywil: alright thanks :)
22:33  timmywil: np
22:34  manster: how can execute a function on ALL $('select') elements WHENEVER they are created
22:34  timmywil: blub3k, going through your code will take more time than i can spare right now
22:34  ngharo: manster: trigger an event when the code to create the select is completed
22:35  timmywil: post the links in here if you're comfortable with that and someone else might be able to take a look
22:35  manster: ngharo, what is the accessor method for that?
22:35  manster: ngharo, what event is triggered when a select element is created?
22:37  blub3k: timmywil: the point is, that my <div id="content"> gets an <div id="accoriond"> via ajax. but i have ne idea where to put my event handler
22:38  ngharo: manster: you can trigger an abitrary event programatically
22:38  ngharo: i assume you have some code which is creating your select elements
22:38  timmywil: blub3k, i did notice you have some js that jquery does automatically for ajax.  are you using jquery for the ajax call?
22:38  blub3k: no i am not using jquery for ajax
22:39  blub3k: i only want to use jquery on that accordion
22:39  blub3k: i it my first time with jquery and that project was ma first time with ajax :D
22:39  timmywil: ah, then the problem is the ajax isn't finished when you want to operate on the html it attaches
22:39  timmywil: you need to have a success function attached the xhr
22:40  timmywil: i don't really know how jquery does it, but you could look at the jquery source
22:40  timmywil: ?source ajax
22:40  bot-t: Line#6280 - "jQuery.support.ajax = !!jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr();" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6280
22:40  manster: ngharo, can you show me how to trigger and arbitrary event programatically? i'm new to jq. what would it look like to create code that applies to every newly created select tag
22:41  magnus_: is it terrible insecure to fetch remote JSON by proxying through a PHP script ?
22:41  magnus_: like .getJSON("myproxy.php?url=http://some.host.com/file.json")
22:41  timmywil: actually http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5760
22:42  blub3k: xhr?
22:42  timmywil: xmlhttprequest
22:43  timmywil: ajax
22:43  timmywil: it's the primary function you use when you want to do ajax, unless it's IE
22:44  RobW: can someone help me figure out why the footer collapse/expand icon disappears momentarily when the footer div is in animation? http://lifecouldbebetter.com/
22:44  RobW: It's the UP and DOWN icon toggler keeps disappearing between animations, can't figure out why.
22:45  RobW: Firebug isn't showing any CSS changes other than switching classes
22:45  RobW: so why's it disappearing? lol
22:45  timmywil: but both ways give you the ability to run code once the request is completed
22:46  timmywil: jquery does all that magic and i've never really looked into doing it myself
22:46  blub3k: timmywil: what do you mean with success function? my ajac does work. it is loading the content to the right place. but the jquery accorion is not attached to my div tag.
22:47  Soopaman: without eval'ing, what options are there to call a native function dynamically? something like scope = "Month"; alert( new Date()["get"+scope].call() ); ?
22:47  timmywil: blub3k, i guess im just confusing you.  see ?g xhr.onreadystatechange
22:47  bot-t: blub3k, XMLHttpRequest Call - Ajax Patterns - http://ajaxpatterns.org/XMLHttpRequest_Call
22:48  timmywil: or see ?ajax
22:48  bot-t: jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
22:48  timmywil: all of those callbacks you can attach, one is if the xhr is successful
22:49  timmywil: anything you put in that callback will run at the right time and you can call .accordian or whatever there
22:49  blub3k: i have found this http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
22:49  timmywil: i don't think that will work since you're not using jquery for the ajax call
22:50  timmywil: yea, "jQuery triggers the ajaxSuccess event"
22:51  oste_: I have a navigation that is using hoverIntent. Problem is on the ipad clicking the navigation the first time works fine, but then cicking it again does not initiate the drop down. You have to click another link in the menu in order to "remove" whatever is causing htis error.
22:51  oste_: any ideas?
22:52  timmywil: unless you want to switch the ajax call to jquery, you're looking at attaching your own callback via xhr.onreadystatechange  (not sure about IE, might be the same)

23:17  SugaSlide: soz
23:17  SugaSlide: im on slow net
23:21  iamjarvo: i am trying to do a ajax submit file but the php that processes the form is on the same page as the form what should i put for the url setting?
23:23  Jordan__: SugaSlide: Ah I fixed it. Stupid error, stupid me
23:23  Jordan__: SugaSlide: The site generally is running slow.
23:27  blub3k: timmywil: git it to work :)
23:27  blub3k: *got
23:27  blub3k: good night
23:28  iamjarvo: what should i put for the URL in .ajax if the php is on the same page?
23:30  nlogax: just "name.php" should work
23:30  nlogax: or an absolute/protocll relative url
23:32  SugaSlide: tinysort is playing up
23:32  SugaSlide: recomendations of a sorter plugin?
23:32  SugaSlide: search returns sortable things :(
23:33  nlogax: sorter plugin? could you specify?
23:33  SugaSlide: im dragging and dropping
23:33  SugaSlide: li from 1 ul to another
23:33  SugaSlide: on the drop.. it needs to re order items
23:33  SugaSlide: based on an attr element inside the li
23:33  SugaSlide: not user sortable
23:33  SugaSlide: must be automatic
23:34  nlogax: the standard js .sort() method takes a function, if that'll work for yu
23:35  SugaSlide: how would i sue it?
23:35  SugaSlide: use
23:36  SugaSlide: <li data-f="client" data-sort="1">Client</li>
23:36  SugaSlide: http://gyazo.com/69f630bf30718886cf9898a47a42f915.png
23:37  nlogax: dunno what your code looks like :) if you're using UI there's all sorts of callbacks
23:37  g_: hi
23:37  nlogax: no pun intended
23:37  SugaSlide: haha
23:37  swiggy: is there a way to swap things? i have an <li id="1"></li> that i want to swap all the children/nodes/everything from it with <li id="2"></li>   so everything from the 2nd <li> will be replaced with everything from <li id=1>
23:37  g_: how do i specify return content as being html in a .get?
23:38  SugaSlide: yeah uisng ui.. just cant seem to get it to "sort"
23:38  SugaSlide: once you dropped
23:38  g_: is it "html" or "HTML" or something else?
23:38  SugaSlide: got it to run a function calling tinysort
23:38  SugaSlide: but it keeps erroring out
23:38  SugaSlide: and i see tinysort is ancient
23:38  SugaSlide: .html()
23:38  SugaSlide: o
23:38  swiggy: is there a way to swap w/ jquery?
23:39  SugaSlide: nvm didnt read the earlier stuff
23:39  nlogax: g_: check out http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
23:39  nlogax: g_: the last param
23:40  nlogax: SugaSlide: not familiar with UI, but there is a "sort" event
23:41  nlogax: dunno if that is for overriding the sort algorithm
23:41  SugaSlide: thats in sortable
23:41  SugaSlide: :/
23:41  SugaSlide: fires when the user "sorts" stuff
23:41  timmywil: swiggy, no, but it wouldn't be hard to write your own
23:41  SugaSlide: its justa  callback function
23:41  jormo: i have jquery loaded inside an iframe and have an element set to be resizable and draggable... when i drag it outside the iframe and mouseup, i want the drag or resize to stop.  how do i accomplish this?  is there a way to STOP a resize/drag operation programmatically?
23:42  swiggy: what would i include?
23:42  nlogax: are yo using droppable or what, SugaSlide ?
23:42  SugaSlide: ye
23:42  g_: nlogax: yeah, thanks, but no examples were supplied, so i checked out .ajax instead
23:43  SugaSlide: i have some pretty shitty code.. will fiddle it
23:43  nlogax: then there's the drop event, where you could move shit around
23:43  SugaSlide: there is
23:43  g_: damn.you.tinnitus
23:43  timmywil: var tmp = $('#1').html(); $('#1').html($('#2').html); $('#2').html(tmp);
23:43  swiggy: $('#myli-id').html()       would that return all the html/children/nodes from my <li> ?
23:43  SugaSlide: but say you drop a li in.. it needs to re order them 1,2,3,4 etc
23:43  timmywil: yes
23:43  swiggy: o nice
23:43  swiggy: thats simple
23:43  SugaSlide: incase the user drops 1,4,3,5,2
23:43  g_: i'm weirded out. i have a .get and it's not returning anything, but i know it should be
23:43  g_: the data object is all fine
23:43  nlogax: g_: have you taken a look in firebug/similar?
23:44  jormo: anyone know if there's a solution to my question?
23:44  jormo: can't find one on google
23:44  nlogax: SugaSlide: well you could just get the children and sort them and stuff them in there
23:44  nlogax: sort on your attr thing
23:44  nlogax: i think jquery even has a .sort these days
23:44  SugaSlide: nopes
23:44  SugaSlide: i lokked lol
23:44  SugaSlide: looked*
23:45  nlogax: ?eval $.fn.sort
23:45  bot-t: nlogax: <function sort() {[native code]}>
23:45  nlogax: boom!
23:45  nlogax: LOOK HARDER
23:45  nlogax: :D
23:45  g_: nlogax: url and data is fine, and the success handler fires
23:46  nlogax: g_: is the response body ok?
23:46  g_: though, after viewing the url (a get form) it looks like it'll take a while so i'm wondering if it's timing out, though the status is "success"
23:46  g_: response body is empty
23:46  nlogax: :s
23:47  SugaSlide: hm
23:48  g_: grr!
23:48  g_: firebug shows the get request as being fine too
23:48  draginx: http://cripplewars.com/why.html can someone PLEASE tell me why the bubble pop up still moves when u hover around even though I'm returning false? Hover over Last lost: Andrew for an example and the code starts at line 325 of the source
23:48  draginx: And why TWO ajax requests are happening when only one should be firing away (in FF)
23:49  g_: though.. the html response in firebug is empty... however, when i manually hit the url, html appears!
23:49  codespectator: is there a way of passing a method into teh $.each()
23:49  g_: i was expecting cripplewars to be about people in wheelchairs fighting
23:50 * g_ disappointed
23:50  codespectator: I keep getting an error saying the method doesn't exist when called within the $.each() method
23:50  codespectator: or rather the method is undefined
23:50  codespectator: any ideas?
23:50  codespectator: would be appreciated
23:51  richardr: Hi, I have checkboxes defined in HTML. I check one, then submit. I'm trying to get the value of the checked radio button but I keep getting undefined. Anyone able to take a look? http://pastie.org/private/e1qbeuqu5pvcpiq2irpota
23:51  richardr: This was previously working.
23:52  nlogax: not sure what you mean, codespectator. maybe you're calling it on the wrong thing? args are a bit iffy. i always forget which is which..
23:52  nlogax: first arg is the index, second is the element
23:52  swiggy: $(select).val('val'); will select the <option> with the value/text of 'val' right?
23:54  timmywil: swiggy, no, to do that you'll have to loop through the options and see if the value matches what you want
23:54  codespectator: nlogax: that is not the issue I am having. Basically I am converting a prototype calendar script to jquery. In one class I have a method that loops through a grouped array (groups of seven days)
23:54  timmywil: er, wait
23:54  timmywil: see ?:contains
23:54  bot-t: :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/

23:55  timmywil: no it doesn't man
23:55  KostasDi: question
23:55  codespectator: I am using the $.each() method to loop through the primary and then the child arrays, but I am trying to call a seperate class method from within the $.each() methid and getting an undefined error
23:55  swiggy: $('#select-id').val('xxx'); will select <option value="xxx">xxx</option>

23:55  g_: TIMMEH
23:55  SugaSlide: still not getting th whole sort thing sigh
23:55  timmywil: i see what you mean by select now, but i don't think you're getting what you want
23:55  KostasDi: when you create a new box and a new line inside, sortables does not work for it
23:56  SugaSlide: would involve mapping the li items.. sorting them as an array
23:56  SugaSlide: then re building them again
23:56  swiggy: timmywil, http://jsfiddle.net/7nSLb/
23:56  swiggy: yes i am?
23:57  swiggy: how are you going to tell me i am not getting what i want?
23:57  swiggy: lol
23:58  g_: the only difference i can see is origin:null is being sent in the header of the .get. can i prevent that?
23:58  timmywil: ok jumped the gun, you said select the option and i thought you wanted a jquery selection
23:58  KostasDi: anyone?
23:58  timmywil: which someone asked about recently
