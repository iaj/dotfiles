00:00  JKarsrud: dabear: whoa, easy there :P
00:00  dabear: JKarsrud: it doesn't behave like other DOMs
00:00  tjholowaychuk: haha no, its not nodejs, its a module for nodejs called jsdom
00:00  dabear: and thats crappy
00:00  tjholowaychuk: nodejs has nothing to do with DOMs
00:00  Cliyeh: anyone here good w/ debugging browser incompatibility code on jquery scripts?
00:00  dabear: and it's a piece of software
00:01  dabear: so crapware is justified
00:01  dabear: ;)
00:01  bakers: Cliyeh: post a simple mockup to jsfiddle.net and we'll look at it
00:01  Cliyeh: not sure where to start looking into fixing the problem
00:01  JKarsrud: Well, then jsdom is crapware, because nodejs is serverside JS and shouldn't know about the DOM at all
00:01  dabear: tjholowaychuk: I assumed you mean the dom implementation you use on top of that shit
00:01  tjholowaychuk: yes lol
00:01  tjholowaychuk: it does suck
00:01  dabear: meant
00:02  JKarsrud: tjholowaychuk: why does your node need to know about the DOM at all?
00:02  tjholowaychuk: node itself is fine
00:02  tjholowaychuk: JKarsrud: a test library im working on
00:02  JKarsrud: again: why does it need to know about the DOM?
00:02  tjholowaychuk: so that you can assert behavior ...
00:02  temp01: dom nomnomnomnom
00:03 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
00:03  Cliyeh: bakers, can I post the link to the page itself?  It seems to work on 1 broswer, but some browser it doesnt
00:03  JKarsrud: tjholowaychuk: Ahh, that kind of test lib. As in unit testing
00:03  JKarsrud: :P
00:03  tjholowaychuk: yeah
00:03  tjholowaychuk: well not unit testing :p but yeah
00:03  bakers: Cliyeh: No, jsfiddle.net a simplified mockup. That lets us tweak the code
00:04  bakers: Cliyeh: often doing a mockup on jsfiddle will reveal the problem anyway
00:04  JKarsrud: I thought you meant a test library like "I'm testing making a library" :)
00:04  JKarsrud: But then I get it
00:04  tjholowaychuk: oh haha
00:04 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:05  JKarsrud: Yeah, guessed you weren't writing some unit test stuff, but test lib like a unit test lib. If you know what I mean?
00:05  Cliyeh: how do I link css sheets on it, full path?
00:05  JKarsrud: You have a CSS pane
00:06  Cliyeh: but I also have line 10 different css files
00:06  Cliyeh: do I break them all up
00:06 --- obsd123_ is now known as obsd123
00:07  serio_: so like, I'm still looking for suggestions on how I can make this better:
00:07  serio_: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/uGFnf/
00:08  serio_: I know I'm doing "some bad stuff", but basically I just wanted to write a plugin that would "piggy back" off of .animate()
00:08  JKarsrud: Cliyeh: make a simplified test case, don't include 1000 lines of CSS, JS and HTML, only what is necessary for your issue to occur
00:08  Cliyeh: that's where my problem,  I thought my site was completed.
00:09  jrockjiggz: serio_: thats pretty slick
00:09  semaphore: serio_: that's pretty snazzy
00:09  Cliyeh: but when testing on the site 1 browser worked the other didnt'
00:09  Brodingo: yeah look good bro
00:09  semaphore: serio_: throw a webkit-transform: in there, maybe
00:09  Cliyeh: http://www.hawaiihotels.com/website2010/RLR_Home.cfm  can some see if they see the tab on the bottom rotates and display?
00:10  brimestone: anyone here used "FlareVideo" before?
00:10  serio_: the whole purpose of this is to just chain together a bunch of .animate() calls to create a kind wave affect that you see all over the place
00:10  serio_: and to eliminate creating a bunch of seperate .animate() calls
00:11  serio_: *separate* rather
00:12  coldhead: sweet correction bro
00:12  serio_: lawl
00:12  Brodingo: serio this isnt criticism but if i was gonna do something like that id probably use each
00:12  serio_: it's a wonder mIRC doesn't have spell check
00:12  bartmax: ajpiano: resulted quite simple... wanna take a look ?
00:12  bartmax: 		var opts = $('datalist').find('option')
00:12  bartmax: 		var datalist = [];
00:12  bartmax: 		opts.each(function(i, opt) {
00:12  bartmax: 			datalist.push({"tag": opt.value});
00:12  bartmax: 		})
00:12  Brodingo: some kind of loop with delay that changes
00:13  erichynds: bro
00:13  serio_: Brodingo, that's what it uses...
00:13  erichynds: ?p @ bartmax
00:13 @bot-t: bartmax, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
00:13  serio_: did you even look at it? lol
00:13  serio_: it's just a wrapper for .each() and .animate()
00:13  Brodingo: well i mean, just skip the plugin business, seems overkill to me
00:13  Brodingo: maybe its not
00:14  Brodingo: maybe i dont know what im talking about
00:14  serio_: it's a simple concept, I think most people would just code it from scratch
00:14  Brodingo: yeah
00:14  serio_: I don't see it being a hugely popular thing
00:14  erichynds: bartmax, use map instead of each
00:15  bartmax: erichynds: why is that?
00:15  serio_: ?.map @ bartmax
00:15 @bot-t: bartmax, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
00:16  erichynds: bartmax, map creates a new array from existing shit.  var datalist = $("datalist").find("option").map(function(){ return {"tag":this.value}; }).get();
00:16  erichynds: boom
00:17  bartmax: niceeeeee

00:36  DAElectric: cliyeh: the built in jquery ui has a tab that has a rotate method
00:36  Cliyeh: Daelectric, I've tried that, but it's crashing cause I've also using the collapsible tab.
00:37  DAElectric: Cliyeh: working example fiddle?
00:37  Cliyeh: my current rotating one works on some browser and some don't display it
00:37  Cliyeh: http://www.hawaiihotels.com/website2010/RLR_Home.cfm
00:38  Cliyeh: can you see if the 4 pictures on the bottom shows for you?
00:38  DAElectric: cliyeh: shows for me but I am using chrome
00:38  Cliyeh: do they rotate also
00:39  Cliyeh: I've tested that page on chrome, firefox, ie, safari and they all work fine
00:39  DAElectric: yes rotates in IE8 as well
00:39  trip5: DAElectric, thanks for the stopImmediatePropagation info... it works great!
00:39  Cliyeh: then I try a ddiferent PC on IE8 and it doesn't display when it starts to rotate

00:39  Cliyeh: don't even know where to start to debug
00:40  jqStarter: any suggestion to make it work?since i dont know about widget

00:40  jqStarter: ok

00:41 --- MindstormsKid_ is now known as MindstormsKid

00:42  DAElectric: jsStarter: the test page works for me. you need to add a resource link the jquery ui css file to make it look right I think
00:42  jqStarter: cliyeh : be patient, somebody in here could be mad :D
00:42  jqStarter: http://www.jsfiddle.net/vmjue/1/ is working?
00:43  DAElectric: Cliyeh: I am using windows 2008 server when I clicked that link
00:43  DAElectric: jqStarter: yes if you type j you get a list of options. they just arent showing good because you dont have the theme linked

00:45  DAElectric: jqStarter dont know why it isnt filtering correctly though
00:46  jqStarter: those already add,,,any missing?
00:46  DAElectric: hmmm I would just link in the main jquery file.
00:47  DAElectric: it is actualy faster to load the one big file rather than all the little files because of the way the browser cant load more than 1 at a time
00:47  erichynds: jqStarter, dont paste code in here.. use a pastebin
00:47  McManiaC: how do you submit a http-form via ajax?

00:48  jqStarter: just a little
00:48  DAElectric: jqStarter: easier on the developer as well
00:48  Cliyeh: which one would you link as the main?  I think I listed all the little files on my too
00:49  jqStarter: DAElectric : how is your way to link in main jquery
00:52  DAElectric: I prefer to use the qoogle cdn
00:53  Cliyeh: is that safe to reference
00:53  DAElectric: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
00:53  DAElectric: why wouldnt be?
00:53  Cliyeh: I'm hjust afraid if they delete any files or if their server crash my site will not work
00:54  Dracos: it's google, it never goes down
00:54  DAElectric: better its a CDN so it grabs it from the closest google server to the user.
00:54  Cliyeh: hey dae, when you tested it the 2k8 server did all load fine for you?
00:55  DAElectric: Cliyeh: yeppers.
00:55  Cliyeh: yeah I'm at a lost then
00:55  DAElectric: the google server hosting the file may be even closer to them than you are and why bother using your own bandwidth
00:56  Cliyeh: that's true too
00:57  DAElectric: the only time I have had a problem was on a goverment job. it would work fine from the users desktops but not when they went to the server
00:57  Cliyeh: going back you what you suggested early w/ the ui script.
00:57  Cliyeh: how does one use 2 differnt tabs scripts on 1 page
00:57  Cliyeh: i am currently using the collapse script
00:58  DAElectric: $("#tabs1 #tabs2").tabs()
00:58  DAElectric: or just make 2 calls
00:59  Cliyeh: ok will play around with it again since this currenty one doesn't work

01:01  DAElectric: of course if you need different option for each tab you will need to call them seperately
01:02  trip5: hmm.. i guess it's not good practice to have an event handler defined within a function... every function call, binds a new event handler...
01:03  bartmax: help creating new elements with jquery? $('<option>').val(this.id).text(this.value) < doesnt work
01:04  trip5: is there a way to make sure an event handler is only bounded once?

01:10  DAElectric: kina like it for the buttons but not for the X
01:11  Snerf: yes, its odd..
01:11  DAElectric: use chrome or some such right click on the X and choose inspect element and you can see what they did to the css that way

01:25  beneggett: RTPMatt: I have 12 thumbnails of things I am doing, I wrote the code to replace the main image to the right of them with a new image from the thumnail, using a attribute - title => src switch, I'd like to bring up an html div of content instead
01:25  beneggett: doe
01:25  beneggett: does that make sense
01:25  beneggett: lol Brodingo
01:25  beneggett: ETiger13, one moment
01:26  RTPMatt: beneggett: so instead of just swaping out that image, you want to replace it with a DIV that has some other content?
01:26  Snerf: ya, i dont see anywhere where it is forcing the icons to be left aligned
01:28  RTPMatt: or do you want it to open a dialog with some content?

02:27  RTPMatt: Fernandos: eh, probably not, but you are talking about putting 100 images on a page, so your performance is already shot
02:27  barrymcgee: many thanks for your help anyway coldhead, and also RTPMatt - much appreciated
02:27  beneggett: RTPMatt: awesome! you are the man, very clean code
02:27  Fernandos: RTPMatt: I'm talking about transforming 100images from a json array into html with jquery templates
02:27  beneggett: why function(e)?
02:28  RTPMatt: e is for the event, a lot of times you use it
02:28  RTPMatt: insteadf of return false; at the end you can put e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();

02:29  beneggett: ah, i get it
02:29  CuDi: http://anantgarg.com/2009/05/13/gmail-facebook-style-jquery-chat/ ow bout this
02:29  RTPMatt: in this case you don't actually need to use it, but many times you do, or it is prefered
02:29  beneggett: right, makes sense, when using many functions
02:30  beneggett: im gonna run to dinner, will be back on later
02:30  RTPMatt: see ya
02:31  Fernandos: coldhead: hmm is it possible to let the jquery template engine parse one entry of the list of 100images by a click?
02:31  Fernandos: so I don't convert all 100images into html at once, but one by one and on demand
02:32  RTPMatt: Fernandos: you could just pass it the single array entry, rather than the entire array
02:32  coldhead: Fernandos: you probably want some kind of lazyload dealio
02:32  Fernandos: true coldhead
02:33  eTiger13: lazyload is a funny work
02:33  coldhead: ?preloading
02:33 @bot-t: Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src.

02:33  eTiger13: i would think loading everything all at once would be the lazy way
02:34  Fernandos: eTiger13: if you can wait 3min that's ok.. but that's laziness on the user side ;)
02:34  coldhead: its the server being lazy, not the programmer
02:35  eTiger13: damn lazy servers need to get their act together
02:35  coldhead: shape up, server
02:35  coldhead: OR SHIP OUT
02:35  coldhead: or take 5
02:35  coldhead: ace
02:37  Fernandos: hmm now I wonder what the last script does.. the github one
02:37  Fernandos: looks as if it will still let all 100images load at once..? idk

02:43  PhonicUK: under anything else its fine
02:43  PhonicUK: but under IE8, jquery and $ evaluate to nothing in the debugger
02:44  PhonicUK: I don't know if its me, IE or something else
02:44  RTPMatt: PhonicUK: dude, there is a ton of ajax calls going out to default.aspx
02:45  PhonicUK: indeed there are
02:45  coldhead: default.aspx is awesome
02:45  RTPMatt: and a bunch of errors coming back
02:45  coldhead: call it early, call it often
02:45  PhonicUK: thats just because its trying to connect to a nonexistant backend
02:45  PhonicUK: look at the page under IE, and you'll see whats up
02:45  coldhead: are you talking about homosexuality in the bible?
02:45  coldhead: oh soz
02:45  coldhead: wrong window
02:46  RTPMatt: i do see that it is borked in IE
02:46  RTPMatt: the loading this just seems like it could be a problem
02:46  PhonicUK: whats really weird
02:46  PhonicUK: if I go into developer mode
02:46  PhonicUK: and click "start debugging"
02:46  PhonicUK: suddenly the source code disappears
02:47  drew_wells: I see this on your JS file: ï»¿$(document).ready(function () {
02:47  drew_wells: you may try editing that and resaving it
02:47  PhonicUK: which file?
02:47  RTPMatt: when you click "start debugging" the page has to reaload
02:47  drew_wells: McMyAdmin.js

02:50  PhonicUK: then click "Start Debugging"

03:06  RTPMatt: sure
03:08  RTPMatt: Boohemian: i dont see any paragraph tags there

03:10  RTPMatt: agib: can you post code?

03:13  agib: in all browsers it works great
03:13  agib: well except IE7-8
03:14  agib: for some reason jQuery freaks out when the event's original target is a SVG or VML or whatever raphael generates

09:15  sac: jigz, parentsUntil doesn't include the element that matches the selector
09:15  sac: it's _Until_
09:15  skamikaze: ss23: maybe it's not an unique id, check out console.log($('#scan'))
09:15  jigz: ?
09:15  jigz: _Until_ ?
09:15  ss23: skamikaze: It echo's the... entire content for that form. Like, the source of it
09:15  sac: so it matches everything up to it but not it
09:16  jigz: oh
09:16  ss23: <form id="scan".... SOURCE OF THE FORM HERE .... </form>
09:16  jigz: is there a way to find nearest ?
09:16  ss23: That's what gets written skamikaze
09:16  skamikaze: online example?
09:16  ss23: skamikaze: I can try, but previously this code was working, now it's not, so I'm trying to find out what could cause the change that's making it *not* work
09:17  sac: jigz, .closest() if you want only select that #parent
09:17  ss23: I'm not sure what I changed to do it though :S
09:17  sac: .closest('#parent')
09:17  jigz: sac: thanx
09:17  ss23: Worth noting though skamikaze, when I bind a .submit() handler to the #scan, that fires
09:17  ss23: But the actual submitting of the form doesn't :S

11:06  rainabba: Bheam: Css doesn't work that way unless you play with IE behaviors. You could attach a handler to the check() event and modify your css inside that handler.
11:06  rainabba: or checked() event (don't remember which).
11:07  rainabba: Bheam: Interestingly enough, I'll be doing something just like that with radio buttons in a bit :)
11:07  Bheam: yea figured, was just wondering if jquery could edit the stylesheet

11:08  Bheam: rainabba: yea i'm creating a radio button with image "control" and i want unselected images to be faded
11:08  rainabba: I'm trying to use the AnyTime plugin (http://www.ama3.com/anytime/) on my ASP.Net app which uses updatePanel (partial updates using AJAX) and it's throwing an error internally "cannot create another AnyTime picker". Anyone familiar enough with using jQuery in ASP.Net to recommend when/how to attach that plugin to avoid this? I'm sure the problem is the partial updates. I can bind the plugin
11:08  rainabba: when the page loads, but then a partial update returns a new control without it bound. If I bind inside page_load(), this error occurs because it's already bound.
11:08  doonie: try searching for 'flow' or 'cycle' plugins :)
11:09  Bheam: is there any jquery selector for an element that isn't checked? :p
11:09  rainabba: Hmm. Perhaps I should just look for a way to unbind the plugin (if bound, or blindly if it won't cause an exception) then bind each time page_load() is called?

11:29  krz: anyone used jquery mobile?
11:35  johnathanb: krz: I've had a look at it, wouldn't say it's ready for production yet.
11:36  johnathanb: I know it's still in Alpha but still
11:36  krz: johnathanb: what are you using in the mean time for mobile development?
11:37  johnathanb: Nothing yet, still looking into alternatives. I'd love to use Sencha Touch but it's so complicated looking to use. Might end up writing something myself until jQuery Mobile is released for production.
11:38  krz: isnt sencha using ext?
11:40  ruby_on_tails: hello
11:41  ruby_on_tails: i want to make an ajax request where if the interent connection disrupts for a sec or two the ajax can work
11:41  ruby_on_tails: how do i do this ?
11:41 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
11:41  ruby_on_tails: i applied a timeout of 10k milliseconds but the ajax request gets aborted instantly as i push the work offline button or the disconnect button
11:42  stvs: ruby_on_tails, odd request.
11:42  stvs: If AJAX would work after I selected "work offline", I'd file a bug in the respective browser's bugbase
11:43  Cork: ruby_on_tails: work offline will kill all open connections
11:43  Cork: ruby_on_tails: you would have to find another way to simulate lost connection
11:43  stvs: Idea: disconnect modem
11:45  johnathanb: krz: I don't know if it uses Ext but it's made by the same people so I assume if you've used ext before you'll be right at home using Sencha Touch.
11:46  ruby_on_tails: the problem is that i have an installer and the user spends a lot of time on it, after than when he hits submit if the internet disconnects that would mean a lot of problems both server side and client side, how do i avoid this ?
11:46  krz: i think ill stick with jquery mobile. im just seeing if it supports some kind of video/audio player
11:47  johnathanb: jrz: Well native HTML5 audio/video will work as long as the browser is capable. You don't need jQ Mobile to do any of that for you.
11:47  johnathanb: krz**
11:47  krz: hmm ok
11:47  ruby_on_tails: Cork: stvs: do i make sense ?
11:47  krz: i dont understand why these mobile frameworks use a single page layout
11:47  krz: even jqtouch does this
11:48  krz: and i believe jquery mobile as well
11:48  krz: having all the content in one page. doesnt this get messy for apps that have several pages?
11:48  Cork: ruby_on_tails: make the transfer to the server a transaction, so it doesn't do anything until it get an ack from the server/client for example
11:49  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:49  Cork: ruby_on_tails: if if you simulate a connection loss where all connections is really closed you can only solve this by making the transfer fail if its not completed
11:49  johnathanb: krz: Well what I do is have that one page then several other html pages what when a nav item is clicked it loads that page into the page section of the page. Page, page, page.
11:50  Cork: ruby_on_tails: normally this should happen with http by default
11:50  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:50  Cork: ruby_on_tails: but ex. you could add a value last in the datapackage and check that its there
11:50  Cork: if you want to be extra sure
11:50  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:51  DragoneneWork2: anyone in here used datatables with tabletools?
11:51  krz: johnathanb: so everything is loaded via ajax? the thing is, the url never changes though. is this normal? what happens if the user wants to bookmark a particular page? or am i missing the point?
11:51  Cork: but ajax can't help you, if the connection is closed its closed
11:51  DragoneneWork2: my datatable seems to break when I use tabletools
11:51  ss23: Gosh!
11:51  ss23: that's no good DragoneneWork2!
11:51  Cork: ruby_on_tails: but normally when you get a connection loss, its only a blipp in the transfer speed
11:51  johnathanb: Well it's to make a native app. When I used it I was building it as a native app using PhoneGap so that wasn't really an issue for me.
11:51  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:51  Cork: ruby_on_tails: so the connection to the server is still open
11:52  Cork: ruby_on_tails: thats why i said offline mode is a poor simulation for this
11:52  ruby_on_tails: hmm

12:07  krz: johnathanb: so you had no problems having everything on a one page layout?
12:08  johnathanb: krz: Nope, none at all. I just kept everything tidy and kept my CSS and JS out of my HTML.

14:00  Kay-: Sorry my bad
14:01  Kay-: ok im using jquery ina large development, and using the .get .post methods to request a page that is doing a large amount of processing
14:01  Kay-: I would like to query the status of a database table
14:01  Kay-: that is being updated by the first metioned script
14:02  Kay-: The issue I have is, currently Jquery awaits completion of the page load with .get/.post before proceeding to the next method which contains a while
14:02  Kay-: that gets the status of the records processed.
14:02  Kay-: How can I make these requests in parallel without having to wait for page load on the first request?
14:03  erichynds: ajax?
14:03  Kay-: will the .ajax call run in parallel?
14:03  shashidhar: bot-t i want to highlight it
14:03  RTPMatt: eh, .get .post should not be waiting unless you set async: false
14:04  shashidhar: Aamir jquery
14:04  Kay-: I have not set async true or false
14:04  RTPMatt: that is how ajax works
14:04  Kay-: what is the default status of async?
14:04  erichynds: async
14:04  erichynds: hence the a in ajax
14:04  RTPMatt: the first a in ajax is asynchronous
14:04  RTPMatt: haha
14:05  Kay-: yes i know this
14:05  Kay-: but it still doesnt change the fact, that .post is infact waiting until the page it is posting too has completed loading..
14:05  RTPMatt: asyns defaults to true, and you should almost never change it
14:06  erichynds: Kay- how are you reaching that conclusion?
14:06  Kay-: in FireBug I can see the calls
14:06  RTPMatt: .post will wait till the post is done to do its callback, it will not hold up the execution of other code though
14:07  erichynds: kay- yes but how do you know they're blocking?
14:07  Kay-: I have an alert before the call
14:07  Maria_: I have this plugin http://www.enricofoschi.com/jquery/twittersuggestion/
14:07  Kay-: alert after the call
14:07  Kay-: and the same for the next
14:07  Maria_: , and I wish change events focus(), blur(),
14:07  erichynds: first off, ?see alert @ Kay-
14:07  Maria_: to .live()
14:07  erichynds: ?alert @ Kay-
14:07 @bot-t: Kay-, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
14:08  Maria_: It does not work for me.
14:08  Kay-: Done that
14:08  erichynds: paste ur code in a pastebin, kay-
14:08  Kay-: same conclusion
14:08  Kay-: 2 secs please
14:09  erichynds: Kay-, you can still alert after a call... doesn't mean the request is blocking execution
14:09  erichynds: just that the ajax isn't done yet by the 2nd alert

14:11  erichynds: Kay- all that stuff is happening in paralkel
14:11  erichynds: parallel
14:12  Tomashe: what you need Maria
14:12  Kay-: I wish it was
14:12  erichynds: it is
14:12  Kay-: I wouldnt be here if it was
14:12  erichynds: unless you set async to false globally in another part of the code
14:12  Kay-: ooo
14:12  Kay-: now thats a good point
14:13  Kay-: see the second document on ready
14:13  erichynds: yeah
14:13  Kay-: thats what its waiting on
14:13  erichynds: you can't do that
14:13  Maria_: I need to change some events to live() in one plugin, but It does not work for me.
14:13  Kay-: right ok
14:13  Kay-: if i take that code
14:13  Kay-: (which is where it was before (same problem))
14:14  erichynds: i mean, it still isn't blocking, but you're going down a dangerous path setting the result to a var like taht
14:14  Kay-: and put it above the get for EbayProgressGetTotal
14:14  Kay-: It still does block
14:14  erichynds: and $(this) in that isn't a DOM element
14:14  erichynds: it's an xhr object i believe
14:14  erichynds: so you're trying to set html() of an xhr
14:15  Kay-: they are other problems which im not interested in right now
14:15  Kay-: the fact of the matter remains
14:15  Kay-: the call to .post is blocking
14:15  Kay-: .get sorry
14:15  erichynds: then you have ajax set to false somewhere
14:16  erichynds: async rather
14:16  Kay-: ok i will try that first
14:16  Kay-: thank you for your help on this one
14:17  Maria_: anyone can help me please

14:28  Josh_: are there any known issues.
14:28  diago: how can I test if a dialog is closing due to a keypress/up/down?
14:28  Maria_: Alguien habla español? :)
14:28  diago: I see before close but event type is dialogclose
14:29  erichynds: Kai- then the request isn't blocking :)
14:29  Kay-: but something else could well be :/
14:30  erichynds: you can tell in the net tab of firebug
14:30  Kay-: XHR?
14:31  erichynds: yeah
14:31  Kay-: I will have a look. if that page was outputing anything but XML/JSON and using flushes do you think that would cause a blocking condition?
14:32  Kay-: or quite simply. that page is a large php process
14:32  Kay-: that does finally complete, after its processed what it needs to process.
14:32  erichynds: i mean, the processing itself could take some time
14:32  ss23: Kay-: A session will block in PHP by default, kind of
14:32  erichynds: and hold up other shit
14:32  erichynds: but the actual request itself won't block
14:33  Kay-: see this what I have long thought
14:34  Kay-: would I be better off using an .ajax call rather than .post/.get?
14:34  erichynds: no, post/get use ajax internally
14:34  Kay-: ok just looks like my code is at fault
14:35  erichynds: ss23 it doesn't matter if the page is called asyncronously
14:35  ss23: Yeah, I realised that after I said it ;_;

15:25  DarkM: Got a question, you can detect a change on a select using $("#myselect").change();
15:25  DarkM: But I'd like to detect if the user opens the select by clicking it and select the current value
15:26  claudio: DarkM, madness.
15:26  DarkM: XD ?
15:26  DarkM: MADNESS?
15:26  DarkM: THIS IS SELECT~
15:26  claudio: DarkM, I mean. Browsers are very "sensible" on their selects :)
15:26  DarkM: Hmm.. Okay so the thing is
15:26  DarkM: When you chose a value, there is an ajax call for the second select's content you see
15:26  claudio: someone of them will fire a click event, others not.
15:27  DarkM: Hmm... :/
15:27  DarkM: Then guess i'll add a default option somehow
15:27  claudio: DarkM, IIRC, Safari and IE 6,7 are the worst
15:27  DarkM: so that i'll get a .change() anyway
15:28  DarkM: Okayokay
15:28  claudio: selects are the worst element to work with (even in CSS)

16:05  RTPMatt: dmarkey:  $("#bugball-34 #information")  is unnecessary, if you have the id, just use the single id, there is no point is looking for an id and a child with an id.  change it to  $("#information")

16:07  fr34k: well dmarkey
16:07  fr34k: u can us a regex selector?
16:08  dmarkey: ermm.. in think class based is easier

16:08  fr34k: okay :)
16:08  dmarkey: thanks for the suggestion though
16:09  dmarkey: BTW  $('#something .somethingelse') .somethingelse can be one level or multiple levels?

16:48  Jonz: gmonnerat, a "form_action" isn't a standard thing
16:48  Jonz: if you're asking if it's possible to get the value of the "action" attribute of a <form> element, then I imagine you could try the .attr method
16:49  gmonnerat: Jonz: sorry my question.. I will check
16:51  gmonnerat: Jonz: not a value, i.e the action calls one script and this script return one response. Is possible get this response?
16:51  Jonz: gmonnerat, sounds like you're talking about ajax
16:52  Aamir: :) yes i think he want to submit form via ajax
16:53  pecanha: Hello friends, I have few table rows with <div class="alvo">, each line has a img with class = j_editar. I began hiding all class="alvo" divs, and now when I click on a specific line img element I would like to show that specific div class="alvo". How can I refer to that specific j_editar element?
16:53  gmonnerat: Jonz: yes, sure. I am trying with ajax. Then, I will try more
16:53  Aamir: ?jquery form plugin @ gmonnerat
16:53 @bot-t: gmonnerat, Form Plugin | jQuery Plugins - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. Other methods include: - formToArray - formSerialize - fieldSeria... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
16:54  mattmtl: what event could I use if I want to trigger an input text after the user has entered something? .keypressed will fire an event every time a key is pressed, I would rather prefer something that fires after a certain "non activity"... and with .change() you need to focus out of the input which is not better.... any suggestion?
16:54  gmonnerat: Aamir: great I will read the documentation
16:54  Aamir: .blur ?
16:55  Aamir: mattmtl, ^
16:55  Aamir: or may be you looking for setTimeout + keydown/keyup
16:58  serio: Feliz Navidad homies
16:58  mattmtl: Aamir: blur and change are not the same?
16:58  serio: mattmtl, no
16:59  josenj: a
16:59  serio: actually.
17:00  serio: hrm
17:00  serio: ?source .change
17:00 @bot-t: Line#2604 - "jQuery.event.special.change = {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#2604
17:01  serio: change fires only when the value is changed
17:01  Jonz: *gasp*
17:02  serio: whereas the blur event is sent to an element when it loses focus
17:02  serio: so, they're not quite the same.
17:04  mattmtl: serio: but given an input text... they should react the same way
17:05  serio: well, no, you can throw your cursor into the a input field, and give it focus, and defocus it by selecting something else
17:05  serio: this would fire blur() but not change()
17:05  serio: as far as I know.
17:05  coachz: hi

17:08  sonuloveu: *code
17:08  Jonz: piece of cum
17:08  serio: interestingly enough, if you change the value, both change and blur fire
17:08  serio: if you don't change anything
17:08  serio: only blur fires
17:08  serio: makes sense.

17:22  markj: do you use firebug?

17:23  ShawnRisk: I do, but maybe I missed that error

However, when I submit the form, the form is not submitting the fact that I cleared out the text from the text field. That is, the value attribute for the text field remains unchanged. I've scoured Google for hours, to no avail. Any ideas?

19:09  wontoner: having a weird problem. I use jQuery to add an IMG tag to the document, which has a class that's defined in the head area. I'm using an IE conditional section to define a special version of the class for IE 8. The conditional class does not get applied
19:09  wontoner: when I remove the IE conditional part, the class gets applied just fine. Any thoughts?
19:12  JRGould: wontoner:  not super familiar with how IE handles those conditional classes - but it may be some sort of script-type functionality that only applies them on dom ready - or your conditional tag is wrong. check out Paul Irish's html 5 boilerplate to see an alternative method - he uses conditional tags to add a class to the <body> for ie6, ie7, ie8  - so then you can just create styles in your normal stylesheet like .myImgStyle {...} a
19:12  JRGould: .ie8 .myImgStyle{...}

19:24  jraines: I have an app which initially loads a "dishes" page, and a function which updates the distances the associated restaurants are from the user.   This function works on the initially loaded "page".  But if I click over to, say, the "restaurants" page, and then back to the "dishes" page, the function no longer manipulates the page.  It seems like the original "dishes" page is under the second dishes page and the restaurants page

20:49 @bot-t: rave, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
20:49 @bot-t: rave, jQuery objects are always truthy, if you want to check if a selection exists, use $("selection").length

21:29  coachz: i'm kinda lost cuz i can only have on unique id per icon

21:59  DAElectric_: I think all the examples use a space
21:59  bamccaig: I've never used a space before. Not in CSS and not in jQuery selectors.
22:00  bamccaig: You can even chain multiple rules. For example, .foo.bar.baz should match <span class="foo bar baz">
22:01  bamccaig: The space will look for children that match. For example, jQuery("span .number") would match the div in this: <span><div class="number"></div></span>
22:01  bamccaig: Without a space it's all one rule, meaning it all has to match a single element.
22:01  croby: bamccaig: sorry, missed what you were trying to do -- see this: http://jsfiddle.net/cUxa7/20/
22:02  croby: bamccaig: you're right on your selectors, no space necessary
22:03  bamccaig: croby: Ah, OK. Yeah, I think I remember having to filter down before removing before... So remove(selector) doesn't work or it's purpose is something else?
22:03  croby: bamccaig: its purpose is something else, its to filter the already selected elements

22:32  croby: buddyq: instead of deleting (i misunderstood the question originally) you could just do $('#home-slides').cycle('pause');
22:34  buddyq: croby, i tried that. If I do that, it wont change slides when you click on a slide or the next/prev.
22:35  buddyq: croby, part of the problem is that when you click on a button or slide, the slide is already slid into the proper place and then should change to the right slide. But then when the slide comes in, it runs the after: command in the plugin and slides to the wrong slide.
22:35  b1lly1: i forget what that method was called, instead of using if(condition) { } else {} /// it was like condition = 1 ? dog = yes : no;
22:36  b1lly1: im trying to find the correct syntax
22:36  croby: b1lly: dog = condition === 1 ? yes : no;
22:37  Brodingo: does hoverintent use the same event objects for over and out as hover?
22:37  Brodingo: like over: function(e){e.pageX}
22:37  croby: buddyq: i'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the cycle plugin in this case, i'd have to dive into it more in order to understand
22:38 @ajpiano: Brodingo yea
22:38  buddyq: croby, http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjquery.malsup.com%2Fcycle%2F&rct=j&q=jquery%20cycle%20&ei=yPr_TM7xNIiq8Abd7ajRBw&usg=AFQjCNElcAZOhI0MDVLXmeYYlMuNEKaeMw&sig2=Ld448_kxgt4kTVp9t0oquQ&cad=rja

22:39  youareno6: To replace text inside a span, is the anything I need to do style-wise to allow this to work properly in IE? See www.bigredradio.com (in IE7) for an example of the problem.
22:39  croby: buddyq: sure, i just don't have time to learn the plugin and then debug it ATM
22:40  metaleks: I'm using $.ajax to POST some data to a server which gives me a csv file back. The csv is correct, but for some reason the browser doesn't treat it like a download (nothing happens when submit is clicked even though the csv is returned). Any ideas?
22:40  semaphore: youareno6: $(selector).addClass('important-class')
22:40  semaphore: important-class{ background-color: #f00;}
22:41  youareno6: semaphore: How is changing the background color going to help spacing?
22:42  semaphore: i don't see any spacing problem

22:42  youareno6: semaphore: Are you viewing in IE7?
22:42  diago: sounds like you are not sending the correct headers from the server
22:44  metaleks: diago, yes I am expecting a download prompt, and I checked the headers and they are fine
22:44  b1lly1: is it possible to do $('$string').css();
22:46  serio: no, but you could add the string to a element in the dom, apply css, then appendTo
22:47  diago: metaleks: I just looked I what I was doing... I post to a hidden iframe target
22:51  Bartzy: ajpiano? :|
22:51  wookiehangover: hey gang, I found an undocumented change from 1.4.3 -> 1.4.4. When using the attribute equals selector, the double quotes seem to be optional in 1.4.3, but are required in 1.4.4. eg $('input[name=newsletter]') works in 1.4.3, but breaks in 1.4.4
22:51  Bartzy: sorry to bother again.. I have a div box with close button and open button...
22:51  wookiehangover: ?pask

22:52  Bartzy: open: app.objects.$options_content.stop(false, true).slideDown(1000);
22:52  metaleks: diago, can you please elaborate?
22:53  Bartzy: the problem is when I click on close and then before the animation ends I click on open, the open starts from the beginning, instead of where the close stopped...
22:53  diago: metaleks: create a hidden <iframe id="myFrame"> and post the form to it <form taget="myFrame"

22:55  biodegabriel: content slider that is....
22:56  arpegius: biodegabriel: holler. slick
22:57  metaleks: diago, I'm building the data to send to the server, so I can't just post what's in the form since a lot of stuff will be missing
22:57  biodegabriel: arpegius:  yup! and it works with out jquery UI, which is nice
22:57  danktamagachi: ?dry
22:57 @bot-t: DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. http://goo.gl/xwCA
22:59  diago: metaleks: I not sure it will work how you are needing then. You may have to inject hidden values for what you build and .submit() the form to the target

23:11  styol: i have a radio input click hooked where i am trying to retrieve a value from an item up the dom with closest but im not able to. closest should select, up the dom, the closest specified item of say for instance .binCount correct?
23:12  erichynds: as long as it's an ancestor
23:13  styol: erichynds: right, it can be anywhere up the dom right? or will it stop in certain scenarios?
23:13  erichynds: anywhere
23:13  erichynds: it stops once it hits a match
23:14  RTPMatt:  styol: it could be the element itsself or any element parent of the element
23:16  styol: erichynds / RTPMatt: yeah im very confused, lemme pastie some stuff.. dom output, .binCount from the highlighted input is the target http://img.vishun.com/cec3c963556f60dd686574a7fcb682a8.png -- http://pastie.org/1360368
23:18  erichynds: that isn't an ancestor
23:18  erichynds: try $(this.form).find('.binCount') from within that bind()

23:20  kevburnsjr: $.load() does not work for script elements in IE8
23:23  buddyq: croby, i'm alerting (elem) from a function and it gives me HTMLLiElement. How can I find out which one that is as an index number? I want to pass the number to another function.
23:23  styol: erichynds: its finding the same element but i still cant figure out how to get the html/text/value out of .binCount, i need to increment it up and down based on this click
23:24  erichynds: styol, so you have correctly found the element?
23:24  erichynds: $(element).text(function(i, text){ return parseInt(text, 10) + 1; })
23:24  erichynds: something like that maybs
23:25  croby: buddyq: what do you mean by an index number
23:25  RTPMatt:  buddyq: use console.log() on the element to see which one it is.  alertingis a terrible way to debug
23:25  buddyq: console.log gives the same info doesnt it?
23:25  [M]ax: right, i currently have this code.. http://pastebin.ca/2014242 the rollover/hover event works wonders but when i hover over the ro div it triggers the mouseout event, any way to stop that?
23:26  RTPMatt: buddyq: as alert???  NO! * 1000
23:27  styol: erichynds: ah i had a boo boo, works now thank you very much. any chance you can link me to more information about ancestry and why this.form works (i am nub)
23:27  erichynds: i can tell you
23:27  erichynds: all inputs have a form property that references the form
23:27  styol: thats cool too i just didnt wanna bug
23:28  erichynds: so you can either use that to get the form element, or start at the input and traverse all the way up
23:28  erichynds: but this.form is much faster
23:28  styol: ah thats a good thing to know, it recognizes itself as part of the <form></form> ?
23:28  erichynds: yeah
23:28  styol: awesome
23:28  styol: probably applies to selects and stuff also?
23:28  erichynds: yeah
23:28  erichynds: textareas etc
23:28  styol: anything wrapped maybe?
23:29  styol: will have to play with it hehe
23:29  erichynds: wrapped?
23:30  styol: yeah like i wonder if like <div><a id="clicked">link</a></div> $('#clicked').click(function(){ $(this.div).hide(); }); or something would work
23:30  erichynds: nope
23:30  erichynds: just this.form
23:30  erichynds: in that case you would have to use closest() or parent() to traverse up
23:31  erichynds: if you clicked on a paragraph inside the form, you'd have to traverse up - only inputs within a form have the form prop
23:31  styol: ah alrightie, yeah im gonna read more about the functions listed in the traversing page
23:31  erichynds: indeed
23:31  styol: nothing else has a similar property?
23:31  erichynds: not to my knowledge
23:31  styol: thanks for the heads up erichynds :) much appreciated

23:33  K^Hattrick: I have a table of 3 columns, each column has 3 cells. I need to get the cell number what I you click. HOW? Thx
23:34  erichynds: is this a riddle
23:34  erichynds: $(this).index() from within that row
23:34  erichynds: or $("td").index( this ) from within all td's
23:34  youareno6: To replace text inside a span, is the anything I need to do style-wise to allow this to work properly in IE7? See www.bigredradio.com (in IE7) for an example of the spacing problem.
23:35  K^Hattrick: erichynds -- index is number in ROW
23:35  K^Hattrick: not in all table
23:35  K^Hattrick: viz example http://jquery.jslab.net/zkousecka/#f437a60f4d7bdc7c71d7cda20149f5f7
23:36  K^Hattrick: i need total number cell in table
23:36  erichynds: then use the 2nd example i gave you
23:36  erichynds: $("td").index(this)
23:36  K^Hattrick: its gave "0"
23:36  K^Hattrick: http://jquery.jslab.net/zkousecka/#2f3cbcb4a50d631ec602f74b34b60814
23:37  erichynds: that isn't the code i gave you
23:37  smcguinness: I'm making a button that on hover drops down a selection box
23:37  erichynds: $("td") <----- $("td").index( this )
23:37  smcguinness: problem is that i have a hover event on the button, that returns mouseleave which hides the dropdown
23:38  smcguinness: thoughts on not hiding when the mouse is hovering on the dropdown?
23:38  K^Hattrick: oh :)
23:38  K^Hattrick: thx
23:38  K^Hattrick: why cannot use this?
23:38  erichynds: because that's the way it works
23:38  erichynds: $("td").index(this) finds the position of your element within all the td's
23:38  K^Hattrick: is any other way how to get goal?
23:39  erichynds: $(this).index() is just among siblings
23:39  erichynds: e.g, that row
23:39  K^Hattrick: because  in this example u focus 2x "td"
23:39  erichynds: cache it outside the selector
23:39  erichynds: so you only hit it once
23:39  erichynds: var tds = $("td") outside the bind shit, then inside, tds.index(this)
23:40  K^Hattrick: im trying ..
23:40  erichynds: do you smell that in which I step?
23:40 * [M]ax out
23:40  [M]ax: check again in the morning
23:40  [M]ax: :D
23:40  K^Hattrick: wait :) pls
23:41  erichynds: here try this http://pastie.org/1360437
23:41  erichynds: pretty sure that syntax works
23:41  K^Hattrick: http://jquery.jslab.net/zkousecka/#9173b8204fbc3380bd03be0583a1ce95
23:41  K^Hattrick: ?
23:42  erichynds: yup
23:42  K^Hattrick: really thx
23:42  K^Hattrick: very helpfull
23:42  K^Hattrick: thx again
23:42  erichynds: no problemo
