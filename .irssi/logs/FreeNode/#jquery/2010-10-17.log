12:28  schalkn: ok, it does find the form using the selector, so it is not that
12:29 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 105 seconds
12:30  schalkn: ok so, the only change in jQuery 1.4.3 is that you can now pass a map off data as the first parameter of the submit function.
12:36  schalkn: hold up, it is binding the event to the form
12:36  schalkn: hmmmm
12:37  schalkn: maybe event.preventDefault does not work in this context, let me try return false instead
12:38  sean`: Do``, whats the bug?
12:38  sean`: describe it, browser situation etc..
12:38  sean`: modulexploited, that shouldn't happen, unless $ is nto jquery
12:38  Do``: sean`: incorrect css value is returned if a textarea is hidden using a display:none parent element
12:39  schalkn: return false also does not prevent the form from being submitted
12:39  Do``: sean`: i dont know if it's any more general than this
12:39  sean`: browsers tested in/
12:39  Do``: chrome ff
12:40  sean`: ah
12:40  sean`: I see
12:40  Do``: it behaves differently than 1.4.2, the new behaviour is neither expected, nor logical
12:41  sean`: well.. there ios a new css engine
12:41  sean`: so might be it, have you checked for similar bugs or reported one?
12:41  sean`: ohcibi, I see it's been added: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7225
12:42  Do``: that was me :)
12:42  Do``: and yes, no similar bugs, forum threads
12:48  schalkn: Ok, not sure if that is a bug or not but, I instead change the submit button to type=button and bound a click event onto it. Now the Ajax request works.
12:49  Hopsy: i am searching for a name
12:49  Hopsy: a tv episode
12:50  nail_: there's no selector for that
12:51  Hopsy: there was a lady that was working in a "rich place". She must sitter two girls blabla
12:52  hrwath: Hopsy, The Nanny?
12:52  Hopsy: no
12:52  Hopsy: it began with an "o"
12:52  Hopsy: something like obvios..
12:53  karan: hey, is ajaxform not compiled into the jqmobile alpha1 build?
12:57  sean`: karan, no
12:58  Yan_Nick: hey guys! how can I add a text before the tabs? #jqueryzu
12:58  Yan_Nick: jqueryui*
12:58  schalkn: karan, hey read in the documentation it meantioned something about usinf the ajaxform plugin, not sure if it is rolled into jqmobile though
12:59  Hopsy: foundd
12:59  Hopsy: hrwath: obsessed lol
12:59  Hopsy: if i am not wrong
12:59  Hopsy: wait
12:59  Hopsy: ugh this is something else

13:00  schalkn: just a sec
13:01  hrwath: Hopsy, ;-)
13:01  Hopsy: Christmass timee: http://www.mariahcarey.com/ yeah lol
13:01  sean`: Yan_Nick, ?
13:01  Yan_Nick: sean`: how can I add a text before the tabs in jquery ui?
13:01  schalkn: sean: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a1/#docs/pages/docs-navmodel.html
13:01  karan: schalkn: i'm sorry, can you link to that part?
13:01  schalkn: Have a look at the section titled Form submissions
13:02  karan: it just mentions using the ajaxform plugin
13:02  karan: but other plugins are in the core
13:02  sean`: When using the ajaxform plugin, form submissions can be automated through Ajax requests, and the results can either be appended into the existing page, or injected into a new page, causing a transition. In the case of the former, the "content" div of the current page will be replaced by the "content" div in the server's response HTML.
13:02  karan: so is tehre a special way to include the plugin?
13:02  sean`: yes
13:02  karan: because i tried doing a straight up script include
13:02  sean`: <script src="ajaxform.js"></script>
13:02  karan: yes but
13:02  karan: jquerymobile executes the ajaxform when it's included right away, and it doesn't work
13:02  karan: or find the plugin that is
13:04 --- Zefster_ is now known as Zefster
13:04  karan: sean`: http://pastie.org/private/iv1a1mphsxskryrsvt5ea
13:04  karan: this is my include
13:04  karan: m2.uwaterloo.edu is a local hostname, but it exists
13:05  sean`: oke
13:05  sean`: well.. that seems about right
13:05  karan: yep, same error
13:05  sean`: what's the error
13:05  karan: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'ajaxform' of object #<an Object> is not a function
13:05  karan: jquery.mobile-1.0a1.js:1027Uncaught TypeError: Property 'ajaxform' of object #<an Object> is not a function
13:05  karan: basically when jquerymobile.js trys to execute the ajaxform method in the switch
13:08  schalkn: interesting, I did not even get an error but then again, I was just using a simple .submit bind on the form and use getJSON inside handler
13:08  schalkn: karan, I got around this by bind a click even into the button
13:08  schalkn: Not a solution, but I work around
13:09  karan: so not using the datarole
13:09  schalkn: This is Alpha, so bugs are to be expected ;D
13:09  karan: but calling the ajaxform on click?
13:09  schalkn: No, just a sec
13:09  karan: k
13:09  karan: the bug seems to be that ajaxform isn't even compiled in, guess they missed it
13:10  karan: i'm surprised none of the 200 bug reports talk about this :P
13:10  schalkn: http://www.jsfiddle.net/Wjz4v/1/
13:10  karan: hmm
13:11  karan: so instead of calilng $.getJSON
13:11  karan: i'd call $.ajaxform ?
13:11  karan: because my response is a full html page
13:11  karan: and i need to dynamically replace the ui-content div
13:11  schalkn: it would also be awesome if they could compile the templates plugin in but I gues that is not a must
13:11  schalkn: I guess it is worth a try karan
13:12  schalkn: let me know if that works
13:12  karan: k
13:12  karan: what i dont get is why including the ajaxform plugin doesn't work schalkn
13:12  karan: i figured including it below jquerymobile.js wont work because it deals with data-roles right away, so i put it above. same problem
13:13  schalkn: karan: definitely worth a bug report seeing we both experience similar type of results
13:13  karan: okie dokie
13:13  karan: i'll file the report, i just wish i was able to understand how to properly load this plugin :P
13:14  schalkn: send me the link to the bug report
13:14  karan: k sec
13:17  karan: schalkn: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/issue/207
13:18  schalkn: cool, I will add my comments as to my particular experience
13:18  karan: thx
13:19  karan: and upvote pls ^_^ i think this is a pretty major issue
13:19  karan: i hope they don't wait until the jan1 1.0 release to update teh alpha
13:20  schalkn: karan: From experience with jQuery issues get resolved pretty quickly
13:21  karan: schalkn: great
13:21  karan: until then, i'm going to try my hand at manually compiling this plugin in
13:24  sean`: karan, whats your pasebin again
13:24  sean`: I think I know what's up
13:24  karan: http://pastie.org/private/iv1a1mphsxskryrsvt5ea
13:24  karan: and btw, the ajax demo in experiments
13:24  karan: is also broken
13:25  karan: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a1/experiments/ajax-search/_search.html
13:25  karan: try it out
13:25  sean`: karan, it should be ajaxForm
13:26  sean`: as a quick fix you could do $.fn.ajaxform = $.fn.ajaxForm
13:26  karan: data-role="ajaxForm" ?
13:26  sean`: that should solve it
13:26  karan: oh
13:26  sean`: karan, yes, but that won't trigger the switch
13:26  karan: yeah i was gonna say
13:26  sean`: the switch is false.. it's for strtolower
13:26  karan: so the file name needs to change
13:26  sean`: it should do .toLowerCase() on the switch
13:26  sean`: no..
13:27  karan: er, function call
13:27  karan: okay ill give it a try, sec
13:27  sean`: $.fn.ajaxform = $.fn.ajaxForm try6 tat
13:27  karan: in jquery.mobile.js?
13:28  karan: i'm not entirely clear on what i'm changing
13:29  sean`: oke
13:29  sean`: after you've called the jquery.ajaxform.js
13:30  sean`: do <script>$.fn.ajaxform = $.fn.ajaxForm;</script>
13:30  sean`: it seems dirty, but let's test if it works first
13:30  karan: kk sec
13:30  karan: nope, same issue
13:31  karan: oh wait
13:31  karan: sec
13:31  karan: my framework was escaping the tags
13:32  karan: sean`: yeah error is still there
13:32  sean`: pastebin
13:33  karan: sean`: http://pastie.org/private/bwh0ouslhx4b7pltzahcg
13:33  sean`: oh lol
13:33  sean`: first try this
13:33  Kezzer: When using tabs, is there anyway when using the animating slide that it doesn't slide upwards before sliding downwards?
13:33  sean`: http://pastie.org/private/lsujourphkqi1ho5lmdvpa
13:33  sean`: if that doesn't work
13:33  sean`: try this
13:34  sean`: http://pastie.org/private/zw27isai7eyghgbnt7haw
13:34  sean`: jquery mobile is dependant on jquery ajaxform, if you wat to use it
13:34  sean`: .. however.. it's executed after domcontentloaded, so.. shouldn't make a diff
13:34  sean`: but eff it, lets do this
13:34  karan: yeah i've tried moving ajaxform above it
13:34  karan: last night when i first had this prob
13:34  sean`: try those
13:34  karan: but i'll try it again sec
13:35  karan: so yeah move ajaxform above
13:35  karan: and if not work then add the script snippet
13:35  karan: sec
13:36  karan: sean`: nope, neither work
13:36  karan: which is why i was really puzzled last night
13:36  sean`: you need to hack jquery mobile for this
13:37  karan: add it to the manifest and build it?
14:00  karan: sean`: adding it to the manifest works
14:00  sean`: ?
14:00  karan: i cloned the repo, added it to the manifest.php file array in /js
14:00  sean`: ok
14:00  karan: and then locally included the combined script
14:00  karan: and it works, minus the theme is blue...
14:03  karan: not sure what the combine script does differently

14:12  harpal: does any one have used latest jquery 1.4.3, I just downloaded that and included in page, when I try to open that page while firebug is open it shows some error about b is undefined
14:13  sean`: harpal, did you just randomly upgrade
14:14  harpal: sean`: means? I just downloaded it from main page, jquery-1.4.3-min.js
14:15  sdistefano: hi! I'm looking for a best practice. I have a program divided into many modules, and I have events, which are random strings. So I do (example) $(window).trigger('update_stuff')
14:15  sdistefano: and then my modules bind with $(window).bind('update_stuff') of course. The problem is that there's no easy solution for the 'this' object problem
14:15  sdistefano:  because I do this inside my modules, it'd be nice if I could use the this object there represneting the object ... rather than window
14:15  sdistefano: do you understand the problem?
14:17  harpal: sean`:  in jquery-1.4.3.js file it shows selector is undefined
14:20  rmurphey: ?proxy @ sdistefano
14:20  bot-t: sdistefano, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
14:20  rmurphey: sdistefano: when you trigger the event, you can pass data to it as well
14:20  rmurphey: and then that data will be available to the callback you gave to bind
14:21  rmurphey: one or the other of those should answer your question -- not sure exactly what you're trying to do
14:22  berttrand: i'm getting an error, "d is undefined" in jquery-1.4.3.min.js   - what to do next?
14:23  sdistefano: rmurphey: brilliant, thanks!
14:25  rmurphey: ?reduce @ berttrand
14:25  bot-t: berttrand, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.

14:33  harpal: rmurphey: I have used jquery-1.4.3-min.js
14:36  harpal: rmurphey: on live event I am getting that error
14:37  Hopsy: harpal: which line?
14:38  harpal: Hopsy: in my code at live('mouseout')
14:38  harpal: Line no 12
14:39  harpal: Hopsy: mouseover works fine
14:40  Hopsy: harpal: you have 2 live functions there
14:40  Hopsy: i am not sure that will work
14:40  harpal: Hopsy: ya
14:40  harpal: Hopsy: ops, so live can be used once?
14:41  Hopsy: harpal: and what happends if you remove the second live
14:41  Hopsy: i dont know
14:41  Hopsy: harpal:
14:41  Hopsy: i also think its not necessary in this case?
14:42  harpal: Hopsy: it dont show that error message
14:42  Hopsy: and the error?
14:42  Hopsy: error dissapears?
14:42  harpal: error is b is undefined on firebug console
14:42  Hopsy: i mean the firebug error
14:43  harpal: ya it dont display error when I remove second live
14:44  harpal: Hey I got it working without any error
14:45  harpal: I removed () from live('mouseout', DisableErrorToolTip());
14:45  harpal: so its now live('mouseout', DisableErrorToolTip);
14:45  harpal: its working fine :D
14:46  Hopsy: harpal: and settimeout?
14:46  Hopsy: did you there also remove the ()
14:47  harpal: Hopsy: setTimeout works fine without any problem
14:47  harpal: Hopsy: should I remove () in setTimeout?
14:48  Hopsy: well :P if it works
14:48  Hopsy: you dont have to
14:54  berttrand: rmurphey: I have a void(0) in a .click() handler, this was throwing the exception.  $('#idofelemnt").click(void(0))
14:55  berttrand: obviouly, uneccesary for it to be there, so its not, no more exceptions
15:10  sean`: berttrand, why do you do that
15:11  gilaniali: I wanted to get started with jquery but obviously need to learn javascript first, can someone suggest a good resource to get started with?
