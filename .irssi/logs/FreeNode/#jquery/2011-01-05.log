00:00  EpiphanyG: goodnight everyone, thanks again for your help mekwall + pender
00:01  mekwall: EpiphanyG: np, cheers
00:01  draginx: mekwall: didnt work :(
00:02  mekwall: draginx: show me some code
00:02  draginx: $("#first_message:not(:last)").remove();
00:02  draginx: sure let me get pastie
00:02  draginx: http://cripplewars.com/text/?msg= or here
00:02  mekwall: that should remove all but the last ?
00:02  draginx: it's all inline
00:02  draginx: yup
00:02  draginx: cause the problem is…when u hit "Send" multiple times like an annoying brat it starts to clog the system
00:03  mekwall: draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Sma2A/
00:03  mekwall: it does work :)
00:03  draginx: right but then why does my script not work?
00:04  draginx: When selecting through ids does it just always limit to 1?
00:04  mekwall: because something else is wrong?
00:04 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
00:04  mekwall: draginx: that selector will always remove just the last element
00:05  draginx: oh i want to remove everything BUT the last element
00:05 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
00:05  mekwall: draginx: i'm talking about the set, not about the dom :D
00:06  draginx: not sure what u mean by 'set'
00:06  mekwall: draginx: and using an id here doesn't make sense... because ids are unique
00:06  draginx: mekwall: right
00:06  draginx: and in my case its SUPPOSE to be unqiue
00:06  draginx: go back to that link i gave u
00:06  draginx: and hit "Send" a bunch of times real fast
00:06  draginx: it starts to clog
00:06  mekwall: draginx: I am looking at it, but don't really understand what you want to do with #first_message
00:07  draginx: o-o hit it slow now
00:07  draginx: and watch how it fades away nicely
00:08  mekwall: $("#first_message:not(:last)").remove(); <--- doesn't make any sense :)
00:08  draginx: why?
00:08  draginx: i want to remove all #first_message's except the last
00:08  mekwall: because #first_message will always be just one element
00:08  draginx: how does that not make sense?
00:08  mekwall: there is no :last
00:08  draginx: well its NOT
00:08  draginx: thats the PROBLEM lol
00:08  mekwall: draginx: then you shouldn't use id... use classes
00:09  mekwall: id must be unique to the dom
00:09  mekwall: there may not be more elements with the same id
00:10  draginx: http://cripplewars.com/text/?msg= when i change everything class it fucks up even more
00:12  mekwall: draginx: I can only say that the code itself is flawed in many ways so it's really hard for me to read it
00:12  khaan: hi everybody: is there anyone experienced with vgrid plugin?
00:12  khaan: i'm having major issues in IE
00:13  ss23: Aren't we all
00:14  mekwall: draginx: exactly what are you trying to accomplish?
00:15  khaan: yeah, that's not a relief, though.
00:15  draginx: mekwall: just trying to get smooth scrolling transition if u click send with "test" you'll see the effect
00:16  ocf: alright so I was working on this jquery animation loop... I got stuck and can't figure out how to refire the loop. I'm already using the callback function of the original animation, so I'm not sure what to do: http://jsfiddle.net/ocf_/JZzgt/
00:17  mekwall: draginx: and a maximum of three messages, yes?
00:17  draginx: yer
00:19  ocf: i should say that no matter where I put either another .animate({},10000,function() {myAnimate();{);, or derivations, code either didn't execute, or got a too much recursion erro
00:19  ocf: r
00:20  ronvanb: <ocf> end the function with a timeout en ad the function. it will loop. or is that not what you are trying to do
00:24  timmywil: ocf, is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/ocf_/JZzgt/
00:24  timmywil: http://jsfiddle.net/JZzgt/1/
00:24  timmywil: sry, didn't update
00:25  timmywil: also, see ?fadeTo
00:25  bot-t: also, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
00:26  Sonderblade: does anyone have experience with the jquery tools library http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html? it has alternative widgets for most jqueryui widgets
00:27  Brodingo: nobody likes jquery tools
00:27  timmywil: sonderblade, never used it myself, but have not heard good things
00:27  Bartzy: Hi
00:27  Bartzy: When I slideToggle (hide) some block of text, which cause the scrolling to get smaller, the screen flickers a lot until the animation is done
00:27  Bartzy: Any idea ?
00:27  Caraes_Naur: nobody likes jquery tools
00:28  Caraes_Naur: if for no other reason than it clobbers the validator module
00:28  Sonderblade: why not???
00:28  ocf: timmywil - yes thats what I wanted, but the problem with doing that is I want the animation to occur every 10 seconds
00:28  Caraes_Naur: and it clobbers other modules, but I don't remember which ones
00:29  ocf: and the way you had it, it executes in the call back function of the final animation, which is set to animate over 2000 seconds (The fadeIn)
00:29 --- Funhouse__ is now known as Funhouse
00:30  timmywil: ocf, http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/JZzgt/2/  what about that
00:31  ocf: yeah i was playign with set timeout earlier, but I couldn't get the timing right. thats perfect, thanks
00:31  timmywil: actually, how about using delay
00:31  mekwall: draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Sma2A/1/
00:31  timmywil: take that back
00:32  timmywil: not the same element
00:32  erichynds: mekwall, do you have a blog or a site or something?
00:32  erichynds: you should get some of the codes you're writing out there.. like select + tooltip and such
00:32  mekwall: erichynds: I'm working on one... but have been doing so for a long time hehe
00:32  erichynds: cool
00:32  ocf: thx timmywil, it works as expected now
00:32  timmywil: kk
00:32  mekwall: erichynds:  will be at writeless.se :)
00:33 --- haskeller is now known as Rufusten
00:33  erichynds: i dig i dig
00:34  JKarsrud: when is the community meetup?
00:35  Brodingo: 8cst
00:36  draginx: mekwall: ty :)
00:36  erichynds: 9est
00:36  JKarsrud: so 3am gmt+1 then :/
00:37  mekwall: draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Sma2A/2/ :P
00:37  mekwall: too see how it looks with different messages
00:38  draginx: hmm doesnt seem as smooth as mine o-o
00:39  Absolute0: I am getting unexepected behavior with my ajax call: http://pastie.org/1429787
00:39  Absolute0: the sign up link is near by so somehow its appending itself to it
00:39  mekwall: draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Sma2A/4/
00:39  mekwall: better?
00:39  Absolute0: i did alert(url) and it was correct
00:39  draginx: yes ty :)
00:41  mekwall: draginx: was just the duration of the animation :P
00:41  JKarsrud: Absolute0: Is .votes really a sibling of the link?
00:41  Absolute0: I even tried hardcoding the full path and it still failed
00:42  Absolute0: JKarsrud: yes http://pastie.org/1429798
00:42  erichynds: Absolute0, "this" in that context is the global object
00:43  JKarsrud: Ahh, I see what the problem is now, didn't read the whole shebang.
00:43  Absolute0: erichynds: alert(url) prints the right url
00:43  mekwall: draginx: container.append(dummy.clone().html('<span class="current_message">' + message + '<br></span>')); <--- WTH!
00:43  JKarsrud: Either pass in this to vote(), or bind the click with jQuery
00:43  mekwall: draginx: just change the dummy ... :P
00:44  Absolute0: ehh it worked before
00:44  erichynds: weird
00:44  Absolute0: i just changed the content a bit and it got broken
00:44  mekwall: draginx: change the dummy to <span class="current_message"></span>
00:44  JKarsrud: Absolute0: Could you paste a more complete example?
00:44  JKarsrud: Or is that everything?
00:44  mekwall: draginx: and then do dummy.clone().text(message)
00:44  draginx: O_o
00:45  linusoleander: If data contains an entire html page, how do I select the form in it?
00:45  linusoleander: I've tried $('form.simple_form', data).html();, but that does not return the form
00:45  draginx: i removed that
00:45  draginx: mekwall: does 8px really look that small? O_o
00:45  PrgmrBill: it does
00:45  PrgmrBill: 8px is not readable to older folks
00:46  coldhead: older folks need to learn to Control-+
00:46  JKarsrud: older folks need to learn to c++, imo
00:46  mekwall: JKarsrud++
00:47  PrgmrBill: I often do use that
00:47  PrgmrBill: it's quite a nice feature
00:48  Absolute0: nevermind its a serverside redirect :)
00:48  JKarsrud: olol
00:48  JKarsrud: lame
00:48  JKarsrud: :P
00:49  mekwall: draginx: it's weird how it stops working if you hammer send
00:49  JKarsrud: Even 14px can seem too small if there's a lot of text and you're on a highres monitor
00:49  Techi602: trying to figure out how to put to ui-autocomplete selected label instead of selected value - the value is set after select event, nothing i can do :(
00:50  JKarsrud: I often have to cmd-+ a couple of times for the font-size to be large enough to be read comfortabely
00:50  abracsi: (prettiness == functionality) != (functionFirst(myskill) || designFirst(mySkill));
00:51  JKarsrud: is that right abracsi
00:51  abracsi: when i start in photoshop, it looks nice, but isn't practical, when i start in code, it works, but doesn't look nice lol
00:51  timmywil: linusoleander, my guess is that form.simple_form isn't the right selector.  Otherwise, if you do $(data).appendTo('body'), does it attach the html to the page?
00:52 --- patman is now known as mvgcf
00:52  mvgcf: hi
00:52  mvgcf: is a irc client written in jquery possible?
00:53  JKarsrud: abracsi: Depends on what it is that's supposed to look nice :P The code can look nice in the beginning while the design looks like shit, but in the end, the design looks nice but the code looks crap :P
00:54  abracsi: yeah i think it looks like a pair of scales, with your skill level at the pivot
00:54  mekwall: mvgcf: the frontend, yes
00:54  mvgcf: but not the backend?
00:54  JKarsrud: Well, my code and design always go hand in hand, in the end they both look epic :P
00:54  mekwall: mvgcf: nope :)
00:54  timmywil: mvgcf, technically neither
00:54  mekwall: mvgcf: and even if it did, I wouldn't advise it
00:55  mvgcf: why not?
00:55  abracsi: heh, good for you JKarsrud
00:55  JKarsrud: right? ;)
00:55  mekwall: mvgcf: because js is not meant to do stuff like that :)
00:56  mvgcf: hmm :>
00:56  mekwall: mvgcf: use twisted lib for python as backend
00:56  mekwall: mvgcf: talk to it with your frontend and send/recieve data with json
00:56  mvgcf: mekwall: thanks, ill have a look
00:56  JKarsrud: macheist had their own chat a few years back that used jquery on the client, php and java in the backend. If it's IRC or just a chat is another question :P
00:56  mekwall: mvgcf: but you'd have to setup a comet server as well, so you can push messages to the client
00:57  JKarsrud: sockets!
00:57  timmywil: IRC is a different protocal than html, so if you're doing "frontend" for it, it aint technically irc.  However, many chat clients have been written in javascript.  Node does it well because of the number of connections it uses and there are people working on server-side jQuery, but I don't really see a big advantage to that except similar syntax
00:57  mekwall: timmywil: eh... what?!
00:58  mvgcf: the advatange i see is to connect webpages with irc channels, without the need of a heavy backend...
00:58  mekwall: timmywil: irc is a protocol, html is a markup language. wth?
00:58  mekwall: you can't compare the two
00:58  JKarsrud: you have webchat.freenode.net
00:58  mekwall: mvgcf: well, there's possibly flash clients or java applets that can do that
00:58  timmywil: you're right, what am i thinking of....
00:59  mvgcf: flash :-(
00:59  mvgcf: java applets :(
00:59  timmywil: nono
00:59  mekwall: timmywil: and doing a frontend in any language, would still make it technically irc...
00:59  abracsi: if webchat.freenode.net didn't look so bad i'd use that
01:00  JKarsrud: abracsi: I use it at work atm, as the network blocks normal IRC connection
01:00  mekwall: mvgcf: http://www.mibbit.com/
01:01  JKarsrud: For some strange reason, but the company I'm consulting for has some strange network policies :P
01:01  timmywil: http
01:01  mekwall: JKarsrud: setup a tunnel to your bnc?
01:01  ss23: I would quit any job that blocked IRc.
01:01  mekwall: luckily, I'm the one blocking the traffic at my work )
01:01  mekwall: ;)
01:01  mekwall: hilarious to redirect facebook.com to a fake site ;)
01:02  mvgcf: :D
01:02  abracsi: mmm. JKarsrud, maybe it's not so bad, but i haven't been in chat rooms in years, and would you believe it, that it took a few hours for my eyes to get used to the lines moving up every so often.. which i found very weird. but Xchat2 is pretty good i have to say.
01:02  JKarsrud: ss23: unfortunately I don't have a choice, as I'm outsourced from my non-IRC-blocking company to another one to do some crazy C# + jQuery magic they're not capable of doing themselves :P
01:03 --- linusoleander__ is now known as linusoleander
01:03  JKarsrud: abracsi: Yeah, xchat is my client of choice on windows at work, here at home I use Adium on my mac :)
01:04  gnarf: JKarsrud: how is adiums irc support
01:04  abracsi: Adium. the one with the duck?
01:04  JKarsrud: that's the one
01:04  gnarf: i use colloquy.app
01:04  abracsi: heh, thought that was just an msn clone
01:04  JKarsrud: gnarf: Pretty good actually. Used colloquy before, but found it better/easier to have all IM/IRC in Adium
01:04  timmywil: adium does irc?
01:04  JKarsrud: abracsi: No, it supports a bunch of protocols
01:05  JKarsrud: 1.4 does, yeah
01:05  timmywil: huh
01:05  JKarsrud: Just add a new account and select IRC as account type
01:05  mekwall: JKarsrud: why not pchat? :)
01:05  JKarsrud: Easy as pie
01:05  marcamillion: anyone know the site that many people refer to when talking about progressive enhancement ?
01:06  mekwall: JKarsrud: http://pchat-irc.com/
01:06  mekwall: it's xchat kinda
01:06  mekwall: forked
01:06  JKarsrud: yeah, so is xchat2 I think
01:06  JKarsrud: I'll look at PChat later I guess :)
01:07  mekwall: yeah but xchat2 is not that updated
01:07  JKarsrud: true enough
01:07  abracsi: on another topic. does css3 mean that jQuery won't need as much animation support. or at least will it have a big impact on how it's implemented.. i mean all that canvas stuff
01:07  draginx: mekwall: yup this is why i need to revert back :(
01:07  JKarsrud: damnit, why did the #jquery-meeting have to be so damn late? :(
01:08  mekwall: JKarsrud: real coders do not sleep
01:08  mekwall: heh, I kinda woke up an hour ago
01:08  mekwall: totally died when I came home from work at 17, so slept to 23:30
01:09  JKarsrud: abracsi: Other than support for other browsers, this is a pretty good tweet about javascript animation: http://twitter.com/#!/davidwalshblog/status/22165744238198784
01:10  abracsi: JKarsrud, cheers
01:10  JKarsrud: abracsi: and canvas != css3 so
01:10  mekwall: anyways, gonna run off to get some food
01:10  mekwall: cya
01:10  JKarsrud: mekwall: cya. Hollar when you get back ;)
01:10  mekwall: JKarsrud: why? anything in mind?
01:10  abracsi: JKarsrud, true, i was bundling css3 with html5 i guess
01:10  JKarsrud: mekwall: nah :P
01:10  mekwall: JKarsrud: I might not get back tonight hehe
01:10  mekwall: alrighty
01:10  JKarsrud: d'oh
01:10  JKarsrud: oh well
01:11  abracsi: lol. fair point made in that tweet
01:11  JKarsrud: Yup
01:12  JKarsrud: css animations are nice, don't get me wrong, but I don't know if there are any events triggered when they're triggered and done etc
01:12  linusoleander: Anyone knows if there is a live event for the validate plugin?
01:13  LakWork_: is there any way to display all bindings of a specific type for a given selector?
01:14  LakWork_: i have a click handler firing twice and i'm not sure where it's getting bound
01:14  marcamillion: there any plugins for form validation ? for both a login form and a registration form ?
01:16  libertiy: hi everyone
01:17  libertiy: i look for some sliding image polaroid thingy in jquery what would such thing be named?
01:17  libertiy: like little [] avatars in a row like 4 above each other then filled out page width and that should move to right or left for starters
01:18  timmywil1: libertiy, ?g jquery carousel plugins
01:18  timmywil1: ?g jquery carousel plugins
01:18  bot-t: timmywil1, jQuery Carousel Plugins: Best Resources, Tutorials And Examples - http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/freebies/jquery-carousel-plugins-tutorials/
01:20  JKarsrud: linusoleander: Hmm, doesn't the plugin support manual triggering of the validation?
01:20  libertiy: thx but carousel is alsno not really it i just want to have some realtime updated image "wall"
01:21  libertiy: when users do stuff the image should fade in and the whole wall should slide
01:21  JKarsrud: marcamillion: You have the jquery.validate-plugin, which is pretty neat
01:21  libertiy: guess there is no such thing in basics so i would need to code that from scratch
01:21  JKarsrud: ?jquery.validate
01:21  bot-t: JKarsrud, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
01:21  timmywil1: mekwall, what i meant was frontend is for websites right?  so, if you're doing front-end code for a chat client, it's not technically irc unless you're doing a proxy through http (not html) to do the right protocols.  seemed like a contradiction in semantics to me.
01:22  linusoleander: JKarsrud: Yes, that may be the case
01:22  linusoleander: Thanks
01:22  timmywil1: was messing around
01:23  JKarsrud: timmywil1: He's afk and probably won't be back
01:23  draginx: mekwall: any idea on a fix to the hammer problem?
01:23  JKarsrud: His words :P
01:23  timmywil1: ah k
01:24  gnarf: bbl
01:36 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
01:37  Aliv3: hi guys
01:37  Aliv3: i;m trying to o something i have no idea how to do
01:37  elpancho: that's hardly vague at all
01:37  Aliv3: i want to make a list like  uhm
01:37  Aliv3: ok well a menu bar
01:37  Aliv3: but when you move your mouse over it slides it over so  its in the center
01:39  JKarsrud: uhm, what?
01:40  JKarsrud: like something you hover and it moves to annoy the user like?
01:40  elpancho: cmon, that made perfect sense!
01:40  elpancho: anyway, i think he's talking about an accordion type of deal
01:40  elpancho: but with hover, and horizontal
01:41  JKarsrud: Ahh, right, didn't really understand
01:42  LakWork_: i've got a click handler being assigned to a button and i cannot figure out for the life of me where it is happening. any advice on how to debug this?
01:44  JKarsrud: LakWork_: Do you have some code?
01:45  elpancho: nope, his click handler is made out of toast
01:45  elpancho: and lemon wedges
01:45  JKarsrud: elpancho: wtf :P
01:45  proEvil: is it possible to limit the number of tabs which can be added by the user?
01:45  JKarsrud: in the browser?
01:46  proEvil: nope! lol :) in jquery-ui-tabs
01:46  JKarsrud: Ahh
01:46 * elpancho 's staying away from that one
01:47  proEvil: staying away from me?
01:47  Aliv3: sry back
01:47  Aliv3: well
01:47  Aliv3: can you get the total width of an element
01:47  elpancho: proEvil, i typed it before you elaborated
01:47  proEvil: puuh
01:48  Aliv3: like if its a list without a width but it has elements inside of it
01:48 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
01:48  Aliv3: like a horizontal wheel menu
01:48 * elpancho 's mind == blown.
01:48  JKarsrud: proEvil: You could always check $('li').length each time the user adds a tab, and if it's  equal to your desired number, you return false
01:49  proEvil: JKarsrud, thx! $('li').length is what i'm seaching for :)
01:49  JKarsrud: :)
01:50  Aliv3: $(this).parent().length() always gives me 1
01:51  JKarsrud: not length
01:51  JKarsrud: width
01:51  JKarsrud: :)
01:52  JKarsrud: $(this).parent().width()
01:53  heauxbag: can fadeIn be used as a substitude for show
01:53  JKarsrud: heauxbag: yup
01:54  Aliv3: superior.sytes.net/bin/pastes/YG38AXR/
01:55  JKarsrud: seems that link didn't work
01:55  Aliv3: so if  you put your mouse over left one they should all be shifted over one and and right two should be in the place of left two
01:57  heauxbag: thanks JKarsrud
01:58  proEvil: JKarsrud, it works nice! thx again
01:58  JKarsrud: no problemo
01:59  proEvil: is there also a easy way to check if a tab with a given title is already opened and switch to that tab instead of reopen it again?
01:59  Aliv3: http://superior.sytes.net/bin/pastes/YG38AXR/ now try
02:00  marcamillion: thanks JKarsrud
02:00  marcamillion: for that validation plugin recommendation
02:06  JKarsrud: marcamillion: No problemo dude ;)
02:06  JKarsrud: or dudess, idk :P
02:11  marcamillion: lol
02:11  marcamillion: i am not a dudess/dudette
02:12  elpancho: Aliv3, look at horizontal accordions
02:13  coldhead: NO U
02:13 --- CDogCity is now known as rob_zelne
02:14  Aliv3: eh
02:14  Aliv3: thats not wat i was looking for but pretty close
02:15  elpancho: same concept, just tinker with the sizing / event and you're done

02:30  chovy: does jquery support $("li:every-7th-child()") selectors?
02:30  Lumpio-: I think it's called nth-child
02:30  Lumpio-: li:nth-child(7) or something
02:30  JKarsrud: nth-child support is good yeah
02:30  Caraes_Naur: I think you mean nth-child(7)
02:31  beasty_: mm hi Lumpio-
02:31  Lumpio-: Or perhaps it's nth-child(7n) ?

02:43  JKarsrud: tcampion: yeah, will be here for another hour or so
02:44  Tprice: ask who?
02:44  tcampion: ok, sorry this is my first time here be gentle :) looking for example of drag and drop cant get mine working. trying to drag from an accordian to a div container. I have it close to working and think im missing something simple.
02:45  tcampion: I want to drag (clone) an image from the accordian to a dive and be able to reposition the cloned image
02:45  tcampion: once dropped
02:45  ss23: I want a million dollars
02:45  ss23: :<
02:45  JKarsrud: tcampion: could you create a jsfiddle?
02:46  tcampion: what is jstfiddle?
02:46  JKarsrud: or do you have a live example somewhere?
02:46  JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net
02:46  JKarsrud: Pick jquery from the list on the left, and include jquery UI, and make a very basic example of what you're trying to do
02:47  tcampion: ok let me fiddle with it and get back to you
02:47  JKarsrud: sure thing :)
02:50  JKarsrud: Try to hurry, will be partly out of this channel in 10 minutes

03:29  Bezerk: Hi all!!
03:29  Foxhoundz: Hi Bezerk!
03:29  Bezerk: Can anyone help me?
03:29  Foxhoundz: Oh I don't know much jQuery, I'm a beginner as well
03:30  Bezerk: I have e very newbie question!!
03:30  JKarsrud: Bezerk: what is it? :)
03:30  joker_: guys can anyone try to help me with this. I am trying to figure out how to use selector when both <div> have same id......http://jsfiddle.net/CrXTk/1/
03:30  Caraes_Naur: divs can't have the same id
03:31  Bezerk: How can I use a jquery plugin in my php code?
03:32  JKarsrud: if you - for some strange reason - have two divs with the same id, jquery will select the first I think
03:32  Bezerk: that plugin I wanna use it http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fb-menu-system
03:32  Caraes_Naur: make the php spit out a <script> tag that points at jquery
03:32  JKarsrud: joker_: So you should use a class="root" instead
03:32  Bezerk: How do I do this?
03:32  joker_: JKarsrud: what do you do when some tags have same id...how to use access desired element
03:33  Bezerk: I have did some tries!
03:33  Bezerk: and didn't work
03:33  mekwall: joker_: there cannot exist two ids with the same name, since ids are unique
03:34  joker_: mekwall:  ok
03:34  mekwall: so trying to get jquery to work around that.... well good luck :)
03:34  Bezerk: ??
03:35  coldhead: you can get around it by using .each and testing .attr('id'), actually :D
03:35  coldhead: its so performan't
03:36  mekwall: coldhead: forbidden!
03:36  mekwall: don't teach em how to do it...
03:36  Caraes_Naur: don't let then get away with bad practices
03:37  coldhead: hey they might as well, no one will ever visit their sites
03:37  ss23: lol
03:37  coldhead: no one visits any sites but facebook now
03:37  ss23: So harsh, so true coldhead
03:37  coldhead: it's all in vain
03:37  ss23: oi
03:37  ss23: I don't even have a facebook :<
03:37  Caraes_Naur: well then, there's no harm in using the blink tag
03:38  mekwall: haha
03:38  Bezerk: Can anyone help me?:
03:38  ss23: Bezerk: You seem to be very confused about how jQuery and PHP work
03:38  mekwall: Bezerk: I'm not getting how you would use a jquery plugin with your php...
03:38  ss23: One is server side, one is client side...
03:38  JKarsrud: joker_: you select by class
03:38  mekwall: using a client-side script on a server-side script
03:38  JKarsrud: $('.classname')
03:38  ss23: If you want a *client* to use jQuery, you echo it in your PHP Bezerk
03:39  joker_: JKarsrud: what if the class name is same?
03:39  Caraes_Naur: class doesn't need to be unique
03:39  joker_: i know but if they have same class name....
03:39  joker_: how do i access it
03:39  mekwall: ss23: echoing stuff like that is just bad practice as well :P
03:40  mekwall: should separate html and php altogether imo
03:40  ss23: mekwall: Within reason, you know what I mean >.<
03:40  mekwall: but that's totally off-topic, so I won't go into that
03:40  mekwall: ss23: yeah I know hehe, just being an ass :D
03:40 * ss23 pokes mekwall in the eye
03:40  ss23: Meanie.
03:41  mekwall: having a good time listening to paul, rebecca, alex and adam :D
03:42  JKarsrud: joker_: DUDE
03:42  joker_: JKarsrud: :)
03:42  JKarsrud: ID's are unique, classes are meant for multiple elements
03:42  JKarsrud: anyways, busy, sorry
03:42  JKarsrud: mekwall will take you through it :)
03:42  mekwall: joker_: $(selector) ?
03:42  JKarsrud: :P
03:43  mekwall: omg
03:43  mekwall: no
03:43  JKarsrud: Haha
03:43  mekwall: bot-t will

03:43  bot-t: ;)
03:43  ss23: mekwall: What's that? I heard something about a jQuery meet today
03:43  joker_: mekwall: thank you:)
03:44  mekwall: ss23: no idea about the jquery meeting... i'm listening to the yayquery podcast -> yayquery.com
03:45  JKarsrud: ss23: It's done in 15 minutes, so you're too late now anyway
03:46  ss23: Eh, it's my first day using jQuery, I'm not up to date on what's happening with it yet :/
03:46  JKarsrud: Then the meeting is way over your head anyway :)
03:46  JKarsrud: They're planning what's going to go into 1.5
03:46  ss23: I heard a rant that jquery was crap once
03:46  mekwall: it
03:47  mekwall: it's over my head as well :)
03:47  ss23: I can't find it though :<
03:47  mekwall: I just don't have enough time to put into learning js and jquery
03:47  mekwall: I would love to work full-time with it, but sadly that's not how it is :P gotta make a living as well
03:47  ss23: Lots of people on here make a living doing exactly that mekwall
03:48  ss23: :S
03:48  ss23: I still do more server side stuff, html/css/jquery is boring beans.
03:48  mekwall: ss23: well... there's always a turf war going on, between jquerists, prototypists, basetwoists, extjsists
03:48  mekwall: and so on
03:48  mekwall: whatever makes your world spin, I say :)
03:48  mekwall: that's the best
03:48  Alex___: Hi all
03:49  mekwall: jQuery is great, but you can't say it's the best... it has its pros and cons just like any framework
03:49  Alex___: does anyone know any decent server-side JS implementations?
03:49  coldhead: no, it's the best
03:49  mekwall: some people would say that using frameworks altogether sucks
03:49  ss23: Alex___: How the hell could you use Javascript on a server?
03:49  ss23: HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
03:49  mekwall: coldhead: I knew you'd say that haha
03:50  mekwall: ss23 ? :)
03:50  mekwall: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript
03:50  Alex___: same as any other programming language - you upload the code and let the server execute it
03:50  mekwall: CommonJS i.e.
03:50  JKarsrud: ss23: node.js?
03:50  ss23: I have to read this BS >.>
03:50  mekwall: still under heavy development
03:50  Alex___: just wondering if anyone has had any experience or has any recommendations?
03:50  JKarsrud: It's fucking awesome
03:50  JKarsrud: Getting better every versjon
03:50  ss23: Okay, since we were in #jqery, I figured it was jquery related
03:50  JKarsrud: Alex___: Look at node.js
03:50  ss23: I can see how you could use Javascript the language, but jquery...
03:51  mekwall: ecmascript :D
03:51  Alex___: integration with jQuery would be awesome - rendering widgets with db generated content
03:52  ss23: But... rendering?
03:52  ss23: You mean, using webkit to interpret the jquery in a psuedobrowser and screenshot it or something?
03:52  coldhead: jQuery doesn't have much to do without a DOM
03:52  ss23: ^
03:53  Alex___: by rendering i mean producing the client side code, not graphically rendering
03:53  Alex___: JKarsrud: node.js looks promising, thanks for the link
03:53  ss23: You cna produce client side JS already. You just send that text to the browser?
03:53  JKarsrud: ss23: serverside js runs on the server, not the client
03:53  ss23: You can manipulate it like any other text that server can manipulate
03:54  Alex___: that is true, but if you can do that manipulation in js then you only need to specialise in one language
03:54  ss23: JKarsrud: He said "producing the client side code", which sounds like just outputing Javascript with certain parts of it genereated from teh server. The server could be using Javascript or anything else, the jquery part of it doesn't matter though
03:55  ss23: Maybe I just get confused about when people are discussing JS vs jQuery in here, idk/c
03:55 * ss23 skips off
03:56  JKarsrud: jQuery IS JavaScript
03:56  mekwall: I'm kinda stumped at the idea of using js for server-side scripting though
03:56  JKarsrud: Can't really get around that
03:56  JKarsrud: mekwall: why=
03:56  JKarsrud: ?
03:57  mekwall: because I think it will have a hard time to perform as well as... let's say, python?
03:57  JKarsrud: We'll see when it matures, but I agree.. But then you'd have to see what you'd use it for though
03:57  initFreeLancer: hello, can anyone please give me a link to making jQuery and Lightbox work?
03:58  mekwall: JKarsrud: whenever it matures, the other existing languages will be even more developed :)
03:58  JKarsrud: mekwall: Well, it's maturing fast
03:58  JKarsrud: node.js that is
03:58  Alex___: it certainly looks like it
03:58  mekwall: JKarsrud: I'm meaning, using it for serving web content
03:59  JKarsrud: Ahh, yeah, it's not quite up to par there :P
03:59  JKarsrud: compared to say python or ruby
03:59  JKarsrud: but it's still nice
03:59  mekwall: also php have been gaining alot performance-wise
03:59  JKarsrud: You could use it as a sort of middleman too
03:59  JKarsrud: php on nginx > php on apache
04:00  JKarsrud: just the server helps php a lot
04:00  mekwall: but I really do hate the non-strict nature of php
04:00  JKarsrud: I fucking hate PHP
04:00  JKarsrud: I'm a C# dude myself :P
04:00  the-erm: I love php.
04:00  mekwall: C# is pretty neat
04:01  JKarsrud: the-erm: this is #jquery, not #php :P
04:01  mekwall: actually built myself a direct connect server in C# like ... 10 years ago
04:01  the-erm: I wrote a mud in php.
04:01  mekwall: JKarsrud: the problem with C#, is that it can never have it's own IRC-channel :D
04:01  JKarsrud: oh, c# has definitely matured since then :P
04:02  mekwall: #C# :D
04:02  JKarsrud: Hahah
04:02  mekwall: lol
04:02  JKarsrud: #csharp
04:02  mekwall: csharp ;)
04:02  mekwall: yeah I know
04:02  JKarsrud: but yeah, good point
04:02  mekwall: but I'm not really a programmer at heart
04:02  Alex___: wow - the http hander in node.js is actually written in JS
04:02  mekwall: I more into uis and usability
04:03  Alex___: hand*l*er
04:03  JKarsrud: mekwall: Yeah, I work with UX mostly
04:03  JKarsrud: Alex___: Yup, neat huh? :)
04:03  Alex___: very neat
04:03  JKarsrud: But okay, meeting's over, time to go to bed
04:03  Alex___: thanks for the links, I am gonna go get my hands dirty
04:04  Alex___: ciaoe!
04:04  mekwall: JKarsrud: good meeting?
04:04  JKarsrud: Work in 4 hours woho!

04:04  JKarsrud: But I didn't want to miss the meeting
04:05  Foxhoundz: have you ever programmed something so complicated, that if you look away for just a second, you will forget what the hell you just created?
04:05  Foxhoundz: Well it just happened to me :(
04:05  mekwall: Foxhoundz: that's what comments are for
04:05  JKarsrud: Interesting stuff going on with jQ atm, 1.5 is gonna be a good one it seems
04:05  coldhead: that's what haskell is for
04:05  coldhead: so that can happen WHILE YOU WATCH

05:55  someprimetime: the next page
05:55  someprimetime: wow that was full of grammatical errors
05:55  someprimetime: sorry bout that
05:56  danheberden: someprimetime - validate just validates, the form can submit as usual
05:56  danheberden: once it's 'valid'
05:56  danheberden: ergo, the next page
05:56  someprimetime: so just an if conditional.. like if $(".form").validate().form() == true or something?
05:56  someprimetime: then do my php?
05:57  danheberden: $('form').validate({ rules: {} });
05:57  danheberden: if valid, submit works

06:48  ablemike: so i am your typical jquery user

06:49  coldhead: cool story, mike
06:49  ablemike: I am a fairly experienced developer in other languages and understand things like class inheritance and etc.

06:50  coldhead: \o
06:51  ablemike: i understand ecma ... i did an ass load in AS 2 and 3
06:51  ablemike: and for the most part that all carries over
06:52  ablemike: what I don't really get is how jquery stacks
06:52  ablemike: i guess i should read a tutorial on jquery plugin dev
06:53  ablemike: like i see this:
06:53  ablemike: $.fn.
06:53  ablemike: and just go ... uh wtf?
06:54  vladikoff: WTF!
06:56  coldhead: ablemike: there are a few good jquery plugin tutorials
06:56  coldhead: be not afear'd
06:57  iszak: or if you're lucky enough Mr. Coldhead will tutor you himself!
06:57  ablemike: ha
06:58  ablemike: is $.fn global scope ?
06:58  Inumedia: I'm having an issue with setting the "top" css property with jQuery, anyone mind helping?
06:59  coldhead: ablemike: $.fn lets you define methods that can work as part of the jQuery chain
06:59  ablemike: and it does things like .extend and what not...
06:59  joeldart: lnumedia, have you also set the position css property?
06:59 * ablemike is reading :)
06:59  coldhead: so things like this will work: $('p').show().ableMikeMethod().toggleClass('futon')
07:00  Inumedia: Yes, I have.
07:00  coldhead: as opposed to jQuery "utils" that don't work with the chain, like $.isArray()
07:00  Inumedia: It works perfectly until I scroll down
07:00  Inumedia: Then it offsets it farther down
07:00  ablemike: does it automatically return or do I have to manually return ?
07:00  coldhead: you have to return the jQuery object
07:00  coldhead: that's what makes the chain work
07:00  ablemike: how does jquery know the function is done?
07:01  ablemike: oh
07:01  ablemike: (jQuery) ?
07:01  coldhead: usually you go return this;
07:01  coldhead: provided this means what you want
07:01  coldhead: it should be a jquery wrapped set, with the elements that have been selected
07:01  ablemike: this == whatever object I would expect the function to give back?
07:01  Inumedia: joeldart, here's where it is http://inumedia.net/database/
07:02  coldhead: so if the selector was $('p') it will return the p elements wrapped in $ goodness
07:02  Inumedia: It works good and when you scroll down the position is still there, but when you resize the window it just messes it all up
07:02  coldhead: Inumedia: alert('Please don\'t resize this window')
07:02  Inumedia: When you resize and you're at the top of the screen, it works, but the farther you're scrolled down and offset, the farther it'll get offset down
07:03  Inumedia: But I want the window to be able to be resized.
07:03  carbonhat: firebug is giving me a "missing ; before statement" error for line 7 of this chunk of code: http://jsfiddle.net/YrjwA/ any ideas?
07:03  coldhead: you maybe wanna bind to the resize event and rejigger the screen size variables?
07:03  Inumedia: coldhead, it reads the resize event properly
07:03  coldhead: oh good
07:03  coldhead: case closed
07:04  Inumedia: The question is, what am I doing wrong when setting the CSS property
07:05  coldhead: carbonhat: what's that 1 doing inside the state[blahblah...
07:05  coldhead: it looks wrong
07:05  ablemike: good lord this is easy

07:07  ablemike: i don't know why i didn't try to do this sooner
07:07 * ablemike feels rather sheepish 
07:07  Inumedia: coldhead, it sets the CSS properly, as I can plainly see in the console, while when I check the position().top, it's not correct
07:07  ablemike: can js functions have _ ?
07:08  joeldart: lnumedia: I'm not seeing the problem
07:08  Prometheus: ablemike: sure
07:08  Prometheus: ablemike: there's underscore.js :P
07:08  Prometheus: it uses _ as namespace
07:08  ablemike: ahhh nice

08:51  sgrover: But to get a "slim" look/feel, you'll probably have to roll your own theme for it.

08:53  sgrover: ionico: a few ways to handle that.  Native JS has a nice window.open() function for exactly that.  Or you can make use of an iframe in a dialog div.
08:54  sgrover: but sorry, haven't seen/used any plugins specifically for working with browser windows.

08:57  jrockjiggz: Hello, i have a page full of functions, and the js is silently failing in firebug.. it could have todo with a getElementById that does not exist, but there is many of these.. does anyone have any suggestions how to trouble-shoot this?
08:57  jrockjiggz: i ran the js in js-lint and there are no errors
08:58  phrearch: console.log until you dont see it anymore?
08:58  jrockjiggz: yea.. that could take forever
09:00  sgrover: cut paste something like "console.log(1);" after each line around the problem area.  Change up the numbers in sequence.  Run your code.  When it fails, the last number shows you the last executed line.  Your problem is immediately after that. :)
09:00  sgrover: (sometimes we just need to slough our way through it...)
09:00  phrearch: yea, thats the way i know it works
09:01  phrearch: i had a one-word bug two weeks back, which costed me 3 days to debug. that was really shitty
09:02  sgrover: Or maybe, if all your IDs are known, cut paste them into an array.  Loop over the array and do something like  if ($("#" + array[i]).length == 0) { console.log(array[i] + "doesn't exist"); }
09:02  phrearch: most of the time its easier to debug when writing clean code, or understanding the code i wanted to port

09:05  amh345: what does minifying actually mean/do?  is it more optimal to use a minified .js?
09:05  jrockjiggz: smaller file size
09:05  amh345: is it because it strips white space?
09:05  jrockjiggz: i'm not completely sure
09:05  sgrover: amh345: strips excess spaces, comments, line feeds, etc.
09:06  jrockjiggz: i wonder if it renames variables to 1 chat names...
09:06  jrockjiggz: *char
09:06  sgrover: jrockjiggz: that's "packing"
09:06  amh345: sgrover: awesome thanks.  i guess during dev regular .js should be used. and when you're all set to go use the minified.   im referring specifically to flowplayer.
09:07  jrockjiggz: amh345: i find implementing minified is fine, if you need to refer to the source, you can open it up online
09:07  sgrover: amh345: if it is not your library, no harm in always using the minified version - if it fails the project has a problem that will be rectified asap.
09:07  amh345: good call.
09:07  amh345: thanks
09:08  sgrover: I only use the regular JS if I need to edit the library or I want to see just what they are doing.
09:11  phrearch: sgrover: yea, thats true :)
09:13  sgrover: yep.  Grover's law hits me every month or two.  I'm learning to catch the warning signs early though.  i.e. "this *should* work, but it's not.  What obvious points am I missing or haven't checked?" :)

11:34  flupke: blackspotwiggins: it doesn't seem to work with turbogears, I'll build the URL by hand then. Thanks
11:34  Aamir: ?g jquery ui tabs @Sonderblade
11:34  bot-t: Sonderblade, jQuery UI - Tabs Demos & Documentation - http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
11:35  javecantrell: jquery tools has a nice plugin for tabs too
11:35  Sonderblade: Aaaarg: i tried jqueryui, but you need to use the jqueryui stylesheet for those to work
11:36  javecantrell: http://flowplayer.org/tools/tabs/index.html
11:36  javecantrell: try that then
11:36  javecantrell: it's very simple
11:36  ndee: is it somehow possible to bind the same function for an event (load an click in my case) in one line?
11:36  Aamir: javecantrell: it too use an extra css file
11:37  blackspotwiggins: flupke, dont know what turbogears is, but it must suck then
11:37  ndee: so the function should get executed for load or click.
11:37  javecantrell: it uses css, it doesn't need to be a seperate file from any other css you're using...
11:37  Sonderblade: jquery tools gives me Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
11:37  neekers: can anybody recommend a finite state machine written using jquery?
11:37  Aamir: ndee:   $('element').bind('click mouseover mousedown' , function(){} )
11:37  ndee: Aamir: sweeeeeet!
11:37  ndee: thanks!
11:38  Aamir: np
11:38  ndee: jquery is so genius.
11:40  mahen23: ndee: no, you make jquery genius
11:41  johnline: its a shame after all the cleverness, its still awful java
11:41  javecantrell: java?
11:41  neekers: heh
11:41  mahen23: java?
11:42  ndee: $('#leasingantrag_alimony').bind('change load', function(){ <-- maybe "load" is the wrong event: When the element and whole DOM is loaded, that function should get executed, also if the element is changed. Isn't that the "load" event?
11:42  neekers: some people make jquery genius, others make it stupid, it all seems to average out... :)
11:42  abracsi: general html question.. what elements would people use to make a sectional list? i have div > ul (multiple) > li (multiple)
11:43  abracsi: it feels wrong
11:43  mahen23: jquery is just a bunch of functions and objects, its the programmer that makes good use of them
11:43  blackspotwiggins: abracsi, why is that wrong?
11:43  Jesdisciple: "sectional"?
11:44  abracsi: blackspotwiggins, because i went to add a title to the ul, and wasn't sure what element to use.. (i'm trying to stop using divs for everything)
11:44  blackspotwiggins: abracsi, h1?
11:44  blackspotwiggins: or whichever is most fit
11:45  abracsi: <ul><h1>hi</h1><li>item1</li></ul> ?
11:45  Jesdisciple: abracsi: invalid
11:46  Jesdisciple: abracsi: put the h1 outside the ul
11:46  blackspotwiggins: yeah
11:46  Jesdisciple: abracsi: then use CSS to overlap them or whatever you need
11:46  ronalds: Nobody else encountered rendering problems in IE8 on <select> drop downs inside a jquery-ui accordion?
11:47  abracsi: ok thanks, that's what i was thinking, only worry was whether there was some sectional list element i didn't know about
11:47 * Jesdisciple still doesn't know what sectional means
11:48  neekers: abracsi: maybe this will help, http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listutorial/sub_master.htm
11:48  abracsi: Jesdisciple... a list with subsections
11:49  neekers: it hink he means nested lists, check out that link
11:49  neekers: think
11:50  abracsi: neekers, i was also thinking about this.. but i was balancing semantics against 'easiness'
11:50  abracsi: choices choices
11:51  Jesdisciple: what's unsemantic or hard about that solution?
11:54  mekwall: hey peeps
11:54  abracsi: Jesdisciple, not having to reference sublists makes the selection a non-brainer for me throughout my widget code. whereas perhaps sublists is the most 'semantically correct' method
11:54  abracsi: sublists = a nested list
11:54  neekers: abracsi: don't worry so much about how you're coding things. just get the job done and refactor your code later if you think you know a better way.
11:55  abracsi: neekers, good advice. but part of this was trying to use lists in the right way.. simply because in the past i've always ignored lists and just nested some divs
11:56  abracsi: anyway, think i've got the approach now, so cheers guys
11:56  Jesdisciple: dunno what your widget code is like, but I would never have considered sectioning a flat list
11:57  abracsi: well. wouldn't you say an accordion is like sectioning a list?
11:57  Jesdisciple: I'm not familiar enough with jQuery to say =)
11:57  Altreus: can someone remind me what the function is called to turn a jquery collection into an array of its contents?
11:58  neekers: i know this is not going to go over well here, but i still like using tables to make forms. it's easier... :)
11:58  Jesdisciple: neekers: some forms are tabular
11:58  neekers: yes, that's true
11:58  abracsi: neekers, hehe.. i'm using negative margins to make the display fancy, and i'm not sure they'd go down very well with tables
11:58  Jesdisciple: if it's tabular a table doesn't violate anything
12:01  Jesdisciple: imo the standard labels-onleft, input-on-right form qualifies as tabular
12:01  Jesdisciple: it would be a pain to lay out as tableless
12:01  Jesdisciple: if not impossible
12:02  sipher: So.. the LOST numbers won powerball (sorta). o_O
12:02  abracsi: also, i suppose forms aren't usually something you're particulary bothered about search engines indexing.. so again tables seem fine
12:02  neekers: Altreus: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
12:03  neekers: i love jquery. :)
12:04  Altreus: bingo!
12:04  Altreus: ta
12:04  neekers: now i just need to build my finite state machine...
12:04  Jesdisciple: abrasci: I concern myself with screenreaders (well, Lynx for frequest testing - screenreaders annoy me) more than search engines
12:04  Altreus: I did an each() anyway because I wanted to do something with $(this) but i'll remember that
12:04  Jesdisciple: if the screenreaders are fine with it I'm pretty sure search engines will be too
12:05  Altreus: actually that's clumsy and I will use this
12:05  Jesdisciple: and screenreaders do need to read forms
12:09  mekwall: http://sixrevisions.com/infographs/web-designers-vs-web-developers/
12:09  mekwall: gotta love that one ;)
12:12  johnline: lol
12:14  juha__: mekwall: so true!
12:14  mekwall: juha_: it sure is :P
12:14 * doonie makes a tshirt that says 'there is no place like helveticAhhhh' 
12:15  mekwall: that would be a hybrid :D
12:15  sean`: http://www.artzstudio.com/files/jquery-boston-2010/jquery.sonar/jquery.sonar.js you guys used this?
12:17  abracsi: man what was the keyword to cancel the last filter in the chain?
12:17  mekwall: ?.end @ abracsi
12:17  bot-t: abracsi, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
12:17  mekwall: sean`: nope, but looks neat
12:17  abracsi: mekwall, bot-t: thanks.
12:17  mahen23: erichynds:
12:18  mekwall: sean`: good for infinite scroll and dynamic image load ;)
12:18  sean`: GOOD FOR MARKETING
12:18  sean`: add objects on your page and give callbacks when they're in viewport
12:18  mekwall: sean`: ofc... but marketing is years behind :/
12:18  sean`: ?muu
12:18  bot-t: much unlike urself
12:19  mekwall: sean`: in sweden, they still rely on pageviews.. morons :/
12:19  mekwall: marketing and banking kinda stays in the 90s era
12:21  mekwall: http://www.akirathedon.com/blobblog/snow-under-a-microscope/ <--- that's pretty awesome
12:25  doonie: kewl mekkie
12:25  abracsi: div inside a list item.. margin of div is ignoring it's parent li.. even though li has position:relative.. any common fix?
12:26  mekwall: abracsi: try making the li to a block element
12:27  mekwall: abracsi: display: block in the css
12:27  mekwall: list-items can be a bit tricky to work with :)
12:28  juha__: is it just me or has google added bunch of new webfonts?
12:28  mekwall: ooh
12:28  mekwall: they have
12:29  mekwall: juha__: nice find :D
12:29  mekwall: UnifrakturCook is great for a nazi themed site
12:29  juha__: mekwall: just what i'm working on!
12:29  mekwall: cool!
12:29  mekwall: tell me when it's done
12:30  juha__: yeah, i was thinking of using ihatejuice.com domain
12:30  khinester: hello
12:30  ndee: what's the event called, when an element is loaded? I tried "load" but that didn't trigger the alert I've set in the function
12:30  abracsi: mekwall, no dice. weird, could be to do with them having no content hmm
12:30  mekwall: juha__: haha, now that's funny!
12:30  mekwall: abracsi: possibly, try adding some then
12:32  juha__: mekwall: it's so funny, that i'm going to cry in the corner now
12:32  abracsi: mekwall, yeah that worked. meaning the li still isn't behaving.. as i wanted this..<li>h<div class="record">21 Jun</div></li>
12:32  mekwall: juha__: don't forget to replenish your water supply afterwards
12:33  mekwall: abracsi: is that /h/ supposed to be in there?
12:33  abracsi: ah.. that was the test content :-p
12:33  mekwall: oh
12:33  abracsi: it works with the h
12:33  abracsi: apart from it showing an h :-)
12:33  mekwall: abracsi: why are you having a div in there btw?
12:34  mekwall: why not just <li class="record">21 Jun</li>
12:34  abracsi: well 2 reasons. the background image of the li shifts from center when i use padding because it's width is 100% of it's container
12:35  abracsi: but mainly because it won't just be text, it will be more like a mini document
12:35  glontu: hi
12:35  glontu: i have some ajax that returns some html.
12:35  abracsi: so i was putting like 20 px margin on the div
12:35 * Jesdisciple is lurking again
12:35  glontu: can i perform a search for a certain class in that returned html ?
12:35  abracsi: rather than 20 px padding on the li
12:35  mekwall: I see
12:35  Jesdisciple: abracsi: li is an inline element
12:36 * neekers is now known as neekers
12:36  Jesdisciple: abracsi: you can't put a div (block element) in it
12:36  mekwall: abracsi: well, I guess you should ask in #css, there are some real wizkids in there :)
12:36  abracsi: because 20px+100% is not 100%.. as we sadly all know
12:36  Jesdisciple: abracsi: you can make the li a block element with CSS if you must, though
12:36  mekwall: yeah, working with percentage and padding, you'd nearly always need a container
12:36  mekwall: Jesdisciple: already told him to do so. didn't help :P
12:37 * Jesdisciple didn't see that
12:37  abracsi: lol... i can see my self going back to exclusively divs in a minute :-p
12:37  Stown18: Hello
12:37  Jesdisciple: mekwall: I don't mean taking the div out
12:37  mekwall: Jesdisciple: neither did I
12:38  Jesdisciple: oh, waaaaaay up there
12:38  Jesdisciple: I luv Ctrl+F =)
12:39  doonie: cmd+f!
12:39  mekwall: Jesdisciple: :D
12:39  Jesdisciple: never used a Mac and that's not on my list of ambitions tbh...
12:40 * mekwall is working from home today
12:40  doonie: again
12:40  mekwall: it's great, because now I can get some newly ground coffee ;)
12:40  doonie: what are they saying about it
12:40  mekwall: work?
12:40  Jesdisciple: ?
12:41  doonie: yea
12:41  mekwall: well, I've got a bad stomach today... so I guess they are happy about me staying home :D
12:41  Jesdisciple: I think doonie is the resident Mac evangelist
12:41  doonie: hehe
12:41  doonie: <3 jes
12:41  doonie: not yet, but I'm getting there :}
12:41  Jesdisciple: convert to Ubuntu or be pwned
12:41  Jesdisciple: lol
12:41  doonie: ew ;p nothx
12:42  abracsi: sod the list, i'm going back to divs lol
12:42  doonie: well on the serverside yes ;)
12:43  mahen23: it would be great if we could end our <div> with the id of the div instead of just </div>,
12:43  mekwall: Jesdisciple: doonie is not only the resident Maca evangelist, he's also the resident punch bag
12:43  Jesdisciple: mahen: ... why?
12:43  mahen23: for example, <div id="music"></music>
12:43  mahen23: Jesdisciple: it makes html more redable
12:43 * doonie kills mekwall with a mIRC script
12:43  mekwall: Jesdisciple: there might be a connection between the two, haven't really figured that out yet :P
12:43  mahen23: read0-able
12:43  ndee: http://www.pastie.org/1430793 <-- why wouldn't that get executed when the page is loaded?
12:44  abracsi: mahan23, i've seen people comment the id of the div after they close it
12:44  Jesdisciple: I disagree, I want the same tagname on start and end
12:44  mahen23: abracsi: that method sucks
12:44  mekwall: doonie: http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=beat
12:44  doonie: I'm not gonna read all that ;D
12:44  abracsi: mahen23, i never have a problem spotting the end, jus with code indenting
12:44  refugee: ndee: Does the element that you are binding it to exist when that code is being called?
12:44  refugee: ndee: I.E., do you have that within a $(document.body).ready() function?
12:45  ndee: refugee, that code is being called within $(document).ready(function() {
12:45  Jesdisciple: mahen23: if IE will just support XHTML we can <music></music>
12:45  mekwall: doonie: yes you are
12:45  mekwall: doonie: simon says
12:46  doonie: u said it in the wrong order! I'm freeeeeeeee
12:47  mekwall: doonie: not if you read it from down to up, like Jesdisciple
12:47 * doonie runs mekwall trough Autoconf version 2.13
12:47  refugee: ndee: I think you may be running into a problem with the page already being loaded. Have you tried using that code with 'click' or any other bind?
12:47  ndee: refugee, it works with bind('change')
12:48  ndee: is there a way to "simulate" a change of an element?
12:48  refugee: ndee: Yeah. It's because you're calling with $(document.body).ready(). When .ready() is called, that means all elements on the page have already been created (loaded).
12:48  ndee: refugee, ah I see.
12:48  mahen23: erichynds:
12:49  refugee: ndee: You can call .change() by itself, just like .click(), and it will trigger the bind with 'change'.
12:50  ndee: refugee, hah funny, I tried it now and it works now, tried it before and it didn't work. Oh well :)
12:50  refugee: ndee: Your cache may not have been caught up with the changes on the page yet. Caches are a developer's enemy.
12:50  ndee: refugee, how true :D
12:51  doonie: mekwall what hw do you run @ home
12:51  Jesdisciple: mekwall: >=(
12:52 * doonie feeds Jesdisciple to a whale
12:52  Jesdisciple: ndee: you can just call an event handler to simulate the event
12:52  Jesdisciple: (not the default action)
12:53  ndee: Jesdisciple, that's what I'm doing now. I was just surprised that the call before wasn't really executed but maybe I just oversaw something :)
12:53  mekwall: doonie: i9 930, 12GB DDR3, ATI Radeon HD 5780, 2xraptor in raid as system, 2x500GB in raid for commonly used files, 1x2TB for storage
12:53  mekwall: i7
12:53  mekwall: doh
12:53  doonie: what a nerd ;p
12:53  ndee: mekwall, you should get SSDs
12:53  doonie: commonly used? pr0n? ;D
12:54  mekwall: doonie: in the best looking corsair obsidian 800d case ;)
12:54  doonie: in what raid 1?
12:54  mekwall: doonie: nah, using raid-0 ... I do backups very often
12:54  doonie: meh my antech is nicer :D
12:54  abracsi: list replaced with nested divs.. works a dream...in conclusion...fuck semantics
12:54  mekwall: antech?! omg :(
12:54  doonie: antec twelve hundred :D
12:54  mekwall: it's ugly
12:54  doonie: or should I say my 'old'
12:54  mekwall: I have that at work
12:55  Jesdisciple: abracsi: your li's can behave just like div's... if you *make them block elements* lol
12:55  mekwall: doonie: http://www.legitreviews.com/images/reviews/1036/corsair_installed_complete.jpg :)
12:55  mekwall: it's sexy
12:55  johnline: i want the obsidian
12:55  abracsi: Jesdisciple.. you'd think so
12:56  mekwall: johnline: buy one as soon as you can! it's the shizzle :D
12:56  johnline: i got tallest case evar
12:56  mahen23: what is wrong? $("#music").css('display' : 'block');
12:56  mekwall: and it's totally worth every penny
12:56  Jesdisciple: abracsi: you'll also need to change the margin etc. ... but yeah I do think so =p
12:56  johnline: lian li pc-x2000
12:56  mekwall: lian li is overpriced imo :/
12:56  refugee: mahen23: You need to enclose the 'display':'block' in {}
12:56  blackspotwiggins: antec p180 is awesome
12:56  johnline: its a good price for such a good case
12:56  johnline: i recently got the corsair hx 650
12:56  mekwall: they do quality cases, but I don't seriously think they are worth it
12:56  refugee: mahen23: For instance: $("#music").css({'display':'block'});
12:57  mekwall: johnline: corsair hx 1000 here ;)
12:57  johnline: i mean the obsidian is a good price
12:57  mekwall: it's overkill, but I might be buying a second gfx-card
12:57  johnline: oh wait, i mean 750
12:57  erichynds: mahen23, i'm running out right now but try just grabbing the $("select").val() instead of going through multiselect
12:57  johnline: i bought it mainly to be more efficient
12:57  mekwall: yes, obisidan is very well priced considering what you get
12:58  mekwall: johnline: more efficient in what way?
12:58  mahen23: dude i searched for you the entire day erichynds
12:58  Krinkle: Hi, I'm wondering why jquery uses parent.children() inside .index() instead of prevAll().  According to Paul irish'es speach from 9 months ago, prevAll() is about 10 per cent faster.
12:58  erichynds: i'm not sure why you're seeing those results - maybe you have a default option with no value?  in any case, i think there may be a unit test for it mahen23
12:58  Krinkle: speech*
12:58  doonie: mekwall ya its nice, very similar :)
12:58  doonie: prefer my imac case  :P
12:58  doonie: don't be hatin'
12:59  mahen23: refugee: $("#music").css('display' , 'block');  <<<<<<<<<<<<< this worked
12:59  johnline: http://johnline.bastage.net/temp/lian_li_pc-x2000_13.jpg
12:59  johnline: thar she is
12:59  erichynds: mahen23, oh i thought you were the dude who emailed me about getChecked ?
12:59  doonie: hehe cool green shizzle
12:59  Altreus: Anyone know how, when using UI Sortable, to prevent the click() event firing on an item when I drop it?
12:59  refugee: mahen23: Of course that worked. That's not what you asked for help on, though.
12:59  johnline: its more quiet and 80% efficient
12:59  mahen23: erichynds: yep it was me
13:00  erichynds: ok
13:00  refugee: mahen23: You made it seem that you wanted multiple CSS assignments in that.
13:00  mekwall: johnline: that is one tall ass case haha
13:00  erichynds: so, try just doing $("select").val() instead
13:00  erichynds: it's the same thing
13:00  doonie: hehehe
13:00  doonie: tall indeed
13:00  mekwall: johnline: very nice h2o-cooling in there
13:00  doonie: 3.5 at the top
13:00  mahen23: erichynds: ok will try that
13:00  blackspotwiggins: holy crap@lianli case
13:00  blackspotwiggins: whoever said that antec is ugly and that isnt.. :/
13:00  johnline: danke
13:01  mekwall: I'm only using hybrid water-cooling
13:01  johnline: http://johnline.bastage.net/temp/lian_li_pc-x2000_11.jpg
13:01  doonie: watercooling is so 2009
13:01  doonie: 2010 even ;D
13:01  mekwall: I only overclock to 4ghz anyways, keeping below 50s anyways
13:01  Krinkle: http://www.slideshare.net/paul.irish/perfcompression/44
13:01  blackspotwiggins: yeah, cascade or nothing :P
13:01  johnline: its hard to pull off wc, and atually have it be effective
13:01  doonie: heh
13:02  Krinkle: Why does jQuery uses parent().children() inside .index() instead of prevAll() ? According to Paul irish'es speach from 9 months ago (see slideshare link above), prevAll() is about 10 per cent faster.
13:02  mekwall: johnline: tagan 1k?
13:02  doonie: 800w
13:02  doonie: can't you see ;p
13:02  doonie: to much water cooling fluid
13:02  mekwall: ah
13:02  mekwall: didn't zoom it
13:02  doonie: ;D ;D
13:02  johnline: yeah those are old pics
13:02  johnline: tagan 800w
13:02  johnline: tagan must have gone bust since
13:03  mekwall: so the hx 750 is more efficient?
13:03  johnline: shame
13:03  doonie: hx is niice
13:03  doonie: isn't it 80+
13:03  johnline: yeah, and modular plugs <3
13:03  mekwall: doonie: ofc it is
13:03  johnline: yeah
13:03  doonie: gold or whatever it was called
13:03  mekwall: yeah I got hx 1k
13:03  johnline: super quiet
13:03  mekwall: upgraded from a zalman 600
13:03  mekwall: hehe, I love the fan on my gfx-card :D
13:03  doonie: u guys are the reason we had snow in dec.!
13:04  doonie: 1kw ffs ;p
13:04  mekwall: it usually runs at 10-20% speed, but if I manually turn it up to 100% it's like a damn vaccuum cleaner haha
13:04  mekwall: doonie: I don't use that much
13:04  mekwall: I mean, a psu with 1k wdoesn't always use 1kw
13:04  JenniferB2: Hi folks.. how can I get the keys of a map or object --> {a:1, b:2} ... ?
13:05  mekwall: it has the capacity of putting out that much effect, but will only do so when it is required, ofc
13:05  blackspotwiggins: you know that running psu at 15-25% capacity is the least efficient solution?
13:05  doonie: yea but still, it can use it if you push it ;D
13:05  johnline: yeah my gpu fan used to be the main noise of my machine
13:05  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: I run mine at about 50%
13:05  blackspotwiggins: unless you run sli/xfire you should not need more than 500W psu
13:05  johnline: now it idles at 30*C
13:05  doonie: ++
13:05  mekwall: my old raptor disks are really eating watts :(
13:05  johnline: was like having a gpu upgrade ;d
13:05  blackspotwiggins: lol wat
13:05  blackspotwiggins: raptor
13:06  mekwall: yeah, I'm gonna replace them...they are getting old
13:06  blackspotwiggins: like 2W more than usual hdd?
13:06  doonie: 9000!
13:06  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: 20 each, kinda
13:07  mekwall: when idle, around 4... but they are never idle :P
13:07  blackspotwiggins: that cant be right
13:07  blackspotwiggins: 1st gen raptor?
13:07  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: might be 2nd
13:07  mekwall: it's not the velociraptor
13:08  doonie: wd green ftw
13:08  doonie: hack the planet!
13:08  mekwall: doonie: they are slow, but I have one 2TB for storage
13:08  doonie: and so on
13:08  johnline: seagate <3
13:08  doonie: ssd <3
13:08  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, according to storagereview.com (which i trust in this stuff)
13:08  johnline: when the price of those reaches earth
13:08  blackspotwiggins: the worst raptor is 12W
13:08  blackspotwiggins: VR is around 7
13:09  johnline: http://johnline.bastage.net/temp/lian_li_pc-x2000_10.jpg
13:09  blackspotwiggins: barracuda 7200 is also around 12W :P
13:09  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: I guess my radio shack-esque measuring equipment isn't up to par :p
13:10  blackspotwiggins: but i agree on wd greens
13:10  blackspotwiggins: might get some 3tb goodness soon
13:10  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: but I only use 50% when gaming or so... right now I am probably down at the 20%s
13:10  blackspotwiggins: for storing my MASSIVE amounts of code :)
13:10  doonie: http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs576.ash2/149818_10150330486910355_620985354_15877287_7932810_n.jpg pwn
13:10  mekwall: but it doesn't matter... the wattage I use comes from the wind :) I pay extra for that
13:11  mekwall: so I do think about the environment
13:11  blackspotwiggins: there should be a mechanical device for powering hdds
13:11  blackspotwiggins: the faster you pedal -> more rpm
13:11  mekwall: lol
13:11  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: how about... an orbo device? :D
13:12  johnline: lol g9 mouse
13:12  johnline: me has too
13:13  mekwall: g9 mouse is the best
13:13  mekwall: have it both at home and at work
13:13  mekwall: a year back I had carpal tunnel syndrome, but switching to g9 made it go away :)
13:13  doonie: yea its great
13:14  doonie: had the latest logitech, cant remember the name
13:14  doonie: but it was shit, switched to this
13:14  mekwall: just the right size so you can have your wrist on the table
13:14  blackspotwiggins: mx518 ftw
13:14  doonie: hehe
13:14  doonie: http://www.testlab.dk/undersider/barmouse-slim.htm I use this at work <3 love it
13:14  doonie: thinking of gettin one for home
13:15  doonie: thought it would be hard to use it, but darnit its greatz :) sometimes miss it at home
13:15  doonie: just need to switch that keyboard to the one with numpad
13:16  doonie: its to effin small to work with
13:16  pashmi: hi there, i am using jquery selectbox/dropdown plugin which changes normal html selecbox to list item... first time when no option selected,  it shows first list item (for example "city name") I want to make it to work in way that when nothing is selected to show default text not the first element of the list for example "city"
13:16  pashmi: any suggestions?
13:17  Miika--: Hello
13:19  Miika--: I'm using this http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html Can it be made to match exactly given word?
13:19  mekwall: yay :P
13:19  mekwall: got wordpress up and running
13:19  Jesdisciple: pashmi: just add a value="" item to the list, labelled City
13:21  pashmi: Jesdisciple: yes i thought about doing that but i think is gonna be confusing because i already jave "all" in the list
13:21  Jesdisciple: how is that confusing?
13:22  pashmi: may be just change the text of "all" to cities
13:22  Jesdisciple: ???
13:22  doonie: hehe
13:22  doonie: just say yes ;P
13:22  Jesdisciple: city | all | Baltimore
13:22  Jesdisciple: that doesn't seem confusing at all
13:23  doonie: what about all the cities starting with an A?!
13:23  pashmi: wjat will happen if cities left selected?
13:23  Jesdisciple: ?
13:23  Jesdisciple: oh
13:23  doonie: hey Jesdisciple, is there some prepaid card one can get in the states for data traffic? :) gonna be there for 3w, need to have google maps working heh
13:23  Jesdisciple: then your server-side code receives $_POST['city'] == ''
13:24  pashmi: so is ganna be problem right?! iam working on drupal by the way
13:24  Jesdisciple: doonie: for a phone?  I don't go that fancy
13:24  Jesdisciple: I'm on prepaid
13:25  Jesdisciple: pasmi: I don't use Drupal so I can't comment on that part
13:25  doonie: its the opposit of fancy heh, just a quick way of having data here in dk. was hoping they have something in the us aswell
13:25  rtnb: hi
13:25  Jesdisciple: but in raw PHP you just if($_POST['city'] == ''){ ... }
13:25  rtnb: i'm having a problem recurring a function
13:25  rtnb: firebug is screaming at me, but its so simple
13:26  pashmi: hmmm i dont have control over that
13:26  Jesdisciple: you can't check the value of the post variable at all?
13:26  rtnb: http://pastebin.com/UueQPGtD
13:26  pashmi: nope
13:26  Jesdisciple: then I hope I never have to use Drupal...
13:27  doonie: ´hehe sure you can
13:27  blackspotwiggins: i herd they just released a new version
13:27  doonie: he just can't ';D
13:27  rtnb: im getting 'too much recursion' errors
13:27  doonie: blackspotwiggins in 2 days
13:27  blackspotwiggins: doonie, http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0
13:27  pashmi: hehe... the reason is i am usung the same plugin another place of the website.. if i change that is ganna conflict with the other one
13:28  Jesdisciple: change both?
13:28  doonie: oh, I read it was gonna be on the 7th ;D meh me no likey
13:28  blackspotwiggins: php feels so weird anyways :P
13:28  doonie: http://www.drupal7releaseparty.org/ check date ;D
13:28  rtnb: [help] getting "too much recursion" errors http://pastebin.com/UueQPGtD
13:28  pashmi: yes they have, but is not good practise to use new released opensource stuff
13:29  blackspotwiggins: doonie, .. and they party 2 days late
13:29  doonie: hehe
13:29  doonie: indeed
13:29  johnline: when i got my g9 mouse
13:29  pashmi: because takes while plugins to get updated too
13:29  doonie: too bad I can't make it ;D
13:29  johnline: i was like http://img.justca.me/img/142-1282449596648.gif
13:29  Miika--: or is there any newer implementation of highlighting words than the thing i pasted
13:29  mahen23: doonie: they are doing one here too
13:29  doonie: bet there will be some hot chicks
13:29  blackspotwiggins: yeah when im going out on friday, ill be definitely shouting "HEY GUYS DRUPAL IS OUT"
13:30  doonie: hehe
13:30  blackspotwiggins: jquery is ok tho
13:30  pashmi: ok, thank you guys
13:30  blackspotwiggins: might do that
13:30  doonie: TELL YOUR FRIENDS!
13:30  doonie: *Like*
13:30 * mahen23 screams:
13:30  mahen23: DRUPAL SUCKS
13:30  doonie: enter fail ;p
13:31  mahen23: its purposely
13:31  doonie: ;\
13:31  Jesdisciple: u failed on purpose?
13:31 * doonie kills mahen23 with a mIRC script
13:31  mahen23: am still alive
13:31  mahen23: am hungry
13:32 * doonie slaps mahen23 with pure nothing
13:32  x3rames: oh noeez, teh mighty mIRC script has failed to do its duty o.o
13:32 * mahen23 eats doonie's face
13:32 * doonie chokes mahen23 with a smiley printed in china
13:32  blackspotwiggins: go for the eyes boo, GO FOR THE EYES
13:32 * mahen23 goes to KFC
13:32  doonie: aww
13:32  doonie: I want kfc!
13:33  doonie: hey Jesdisciple in what places should one visit to eat 'the good' stuff :)
13:33  doonie: and I don't mean a supersized meal @mcd ;D
13:34  blackspotwiggins: gourmet restaurants
13:34  doonie: ;p
13:34  blackspotwiggins: they are actually really really good
13:34  blackspotwiggins: at least around here
13:34  doonie: I will go visit hells kitchen! and yell at ramsey!
13:35  Krinkle: "To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed. Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing tag:"
13:35  Krinkle: I read that on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
13:35  blackspotwiggins: Krinkle, that would be correct
13:35  Krinkle: I would like to know if someone here knows if that is still correct
13:35  blackspotwiggins: mostly IE pukes on bad syntax
13:35  Krinkle: because I read benhmarks that $( '<a>' ) is way faster
13:35  tsyrak: hey guys, has anyone experienced dodgy stuff with draggable+droppable... like the draggable moving BEHIND the droppable when being dragged around? that'd be a great help :/
13:35  Krinkle: or <a/>
13:35  blackspotwiggins: $('<a>') should be ok
13:35  doonie: by how many nanosecs?
13:36  blackspotwiggins: but if you have multiple elements, i'd close them
13:36  mekwall: http://writeless.se/ !
13:36  mekwall: slowly getting my blog up to pace
13:36  Krinkle: doonie: Faster because the string functions have to do less work. however if it has sideeffects...
13:36  blackspotwiggins: you could also use pure dom functions to create the element
13:36  doonie: :)
13:36  rtnb: [help] getting "too much recursion" errors http://pastebin.com/UueQPGtD
13:36  Krinkle: blackspotwiggins: Yes, but I simplified the case
13:36  Krinkle: may $('<a href="http://jquery.com"></a>'); be $('<a href="http://jquery.com"/>');
13:37  rtnb: krinkle no
13:37  rtnb: anchor tag is not an empty element
13:37  blackspotwiggins: rtnb, if you want to pass a function to settimeout with parameters
13:37  juha__: do anyone have any nice css3 button related articles somewhere?
13:37  Krinkle: okay, rtnb. What about: $('<a href="http://jquery.com">');
13:37  blackspotwiggins: you have to wrap it
13:37  blackspotwiggins: otherwise it gets evaluated
13:38  blackspotwiggins: hence infinite recursion
13:38  rtnb: krinkle no that'ts not valid either
13:38  blackspotwiggins: like 80s music video
13:38  rtnb: blackspotwiggins what do you mean wrap it?
13:38  blackspotwiggins: Krinkle, $('<a>', { href : "jquery.com"})
13:38  doonie: pwned
13:38  rtnb: gg
13:38  Krinkle: blackspotwiggins: True
13:38  blackspotwiggins: rtnb, setTimeout(function() { getUsers(blabla) }, 1234)
13:39  mekwall: wth?!
13:39  rtnb: ah
13:39  Krinkle: blackspotwiggins: but is using that object for attribs faster ? I doubt it.
13:39 * Krinkle goes benchmarking
13:39  mekwall: $('<a href="http://jquery.com">'); <--- will work
13:39  blackspotwiggins: Krinkle, microbenchmarks dont matter
13:39  mekwall: don't say it isn't valid
13:39  doonie: ok, it's invalid!
13:39 * doonie grins 
13:39  Krinkle: mekwall: Well, that depends on what jquery does and what your browser does
13:39  JKarsrud: Krinkle: It's slower to pass an object, but who cares?
13:40  mekwall: Krinkle: jquery will add the missing pieces :)
13:40  doonie: won't the browser do that
13:40  Krinkle: if it's jquery that closes it for me when it inserts it into the dom then there's no trouble in going without '</a>'.
13:40  Krinkle: if it's not jquery but the browser then it's debatable if one should leave it away. Perhaps not all browsers correct it
13:41  JKarsrud: Yes they do
13:41  Krinkle: indeed, I just thought of that when I hit return
13:41  Krinkle: browsers always keep a valid DOM.
13:41  doonie: 8)
13:41  doonie: doonie++
13:41  Lampoon: MmMMhmm. Right. You just k... /me sighs.
13:41  doonie: hehe
13:41  Krinkle: elements can't be unclosed, the browser will make it valid one way or another.
13:41  JKarsrud: do you document.createElement('a'); document.closeElement('a') ?
13:41  doonie: i think that /me should be on a newline ;D
13:42  JKarsrud: doonie: I think you're right :P
13:42  blackspotwiggins: doonie, maybe. dont question the bot :P
13:42  doonie: ok sowy
13:42  doonie: doonie+++
13:42  doonie: haxed!
13:42  mekwall: meh
13:42  mekwall: jquery ... browser...
13:42  Aamir: if we know the index of the object in array, how can we remove it from the array?
13:42  JKarsrud: Lol, attending the jquery meeting last night made me miss work today for sure
13:42  mekwall: jquery makes use of the browsers engine doh
13:42  blackspotwiggins: Aamir, Array.splice
13:42  doonie: hehehe
13:43  blackspotwiggins: JKarsrud, that was last night?
13:43  mekwall: and if you do $('<element>'); it's in my eyes jquery that's doing the job :)
13:43  doonie: JKarsrud which is why i slept ;D
13:43  JKarsrud: Yup, 9pm EST, so 3am CET :P
13:43  blackspotwiggins: i thought it would be today :/
13:43  JKarsrud: Nopes
13:43  JKarsrud: It was yesterday
13:43  Aamir: blackspotwiggins:  it needs starting index and the number of items but what if i want to remove an item from the middle of array
13:43  blackspotwiggins: logs/results anywhere?
13:43  blackspotwiggins: Aamir, so?
13:43  blackspotwiggins: you have both
13:44  Aamir: humm let me try it
13:44  blackspotwiggins: ?eval [1,2,3].splice(2,1)
13:44  bot-t: blackspotwiggins: [3]
13:44  Jesdisciple: doonie: mom and pop restaurants are often good
13:44  blackspotwiggins: ?eval var a = [1,2,3]; a.splice(2,1); a
13:44  bot-t: blackspotwiggins: [1, 2]
13:44  Aamir: blackspotwiggins:  remove 2 from  1,2,3
13:44  blackspotwiggins: ?eval var a = [1,2,3]; a.splice(1,1); a
13:44  bot-t: blackspotwiggins: [1, 3]
13:45  Aamir: :P got it
13:48  JKarsrud: blackspotwiggins: Not really sure where logs are, but I have them locally ofcourse
13:48  Aamir: ?eval a = [0,1,2,3,4,5]; a.splice(3,1); a
13:48  bot-t: Aamir: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
13:49  JKarsrud: blackspotwiggins: Basically, people were unsure on how to implement deferreds, if then() should take both success and error fn's etc
13:49  JKarsrud: And how that would work in the rewritten ajax stuff
13:50  JKarsrud: I'll see I can upload the logs if I don't find any :)
13:51 * doonie hits JKarsrud with a big dictionary
13:51  tsyrak: okay if you drag a draggable above something with a background color... the draggable is drawn BELOW said background... this is stupid
13:51  JKarsrud: orly?
13:51  JKarsrud: why, doonie, why?
13:51  doonie: why not
13:51  blackspotwiggins: JKarsrud, i saw some discussion about that
13:51  JKarsrud: true dat
13:51  doonie: hehe
13:51  blackspotwiggins: that there is little to no difference
13:51  doonie: no pain no gain
13:52  blackspotwiggins: one can be fit to another with very little effort
13:52  blackspotwiggins: at that time there were two syntactical suggestions
13:52  blackspotwiggins: i would think having one object with callbacks is more in line with jquery style
13:52  JKarsrud: blackspotwiggins: yeah, that's what they landed on. someone suggested that the developer could even send in two arrays of callbacks
13:53  blackspotwiggins: we must go deeper!
13:53  doonie: ew ;p
13:53 * doonie slaps blackspotwiggins with a hat
13:53  blackspotwiggins: C A L L B A C K S
13:53  JKarsrud: like $.when(something).then([successone, successtwo, successthree], [error1, error2, error3])
13:53  blackspotwiggins: thats just weird
13:53  doonie: indeed
13:54  doonie: thats not simplifying things
13:54  blackspotwiggins: even [ [success1, error1], [success2, error2] ] would be better
13:54  JKarsrud: not saying you should, just that you could
13:54  JKarsrud: blackspotwiggins: yeah, or that
13:54  JKarsrud: but I think they landed on something like $.when(something).then(success, fail)
13:54  JKarsrud: or just .then(success).fail(fail) if that's more to your liking
13:55  blackspotwiggins: if ajax async drives regular devs crazy, then this one will make them suicide for sure :P
13:55  doonie: :)
13:55  doonie: promise
13:55  JKarsrud: yeah
13:55  blackspotwiggins: why is i not have datas now?
13:56  blackspotwiggins: that's one thing about deferreds, they are useful for sure
13:56  JKarsrud: Mm
13:56  blackspotwiggins: but i dont think they belong to core jquery
13:56  JKarsrud: okay, why not?
13:56  doonie: jq deffie
13:56  doonie: lloads of stuff don't belong in the core
13:56  blackspotwiggins: agreed
13:57  doonie: to late for that though
13:57  doonie: mootools thought of it
13:57  blackspotwiggins: maybe thats just me, but i would like a bit more focus
13:57  JKarsrud: Well, I think it's a good move to put it in there, with the new ajax rewrite
13:57  blackspotwiggins: so ok, we have this kickass lib for working with DOM
13:58  blackspotwiggins: but it's slowly getting very wide in scope (it being jquery all together)
13:58  blackspotwiggins: it's a good thing that UI and mobile are separate projects
13:58  doonie: I guess as long as google hosts it its 'ok' heh
13:58  JKarsrud: Well, they are making a move to make jquery more app-friendly etc
13:59  doonie: note: 1.2.5 and 1.2.4 are not hosted due to their short and unstable lives in the wild...
13:59  doonie: they should add 1.4.3 ;D
13:59  JKarsrud: one thing that's definitely gonna be nice, is pulling away all jquery-specific stuff from sizzle to make it faster
13:59  JKarsrud: doonie: yeah!
14:00  blackspotwiggins: sizzle has jquery specific stuff?
14:01  doonie: wouldn't think so, not sure
14:01  JKarsrud: Yup, :odd :even etc
14:01  JKarsrud: things that aren't in qSA
14:01  blackspotwiggins: i would argue that they are sizzle specific
14:02  blackspotwiggins: :odd and :even can be shorthands for :nth-child(2n)
14:02  blackspotwiggins: and 2n+1
14:02  JKarsrud: exactly, and that's what we want people to use, right?
14:02  JKarsrud: Because it's damn fast
14:02  jetienne: jQuery("myInputId").focus() should set the keyboard forcus on the element, no ?
14:03  blackspotwiggins: jetienne, if you add # then yes
14:03  JKarsrud: It's just to make sizzle even faster, as it only has to check if something exists in qSA, and if it doesn't, does it itself
14:04  jetienne: blackspotwiggins: any idea why it wouldnt ? (beside the #)
14:04  Cork: jetienne: the element need to be able to take focus
14:05  temp01: blackspotwiggins: http://bot-t.com/logs/jquery-meeting/2011-01-04
14:05  JKarsrud: and then all this :odd :even :first and all jquery shorthand selector stuff is in jquery core
14:05  blackspotwiggins: temp01, thank you
14:05  temp01: 21:00
14:05  JKarsrud: Making them slower, but then maybe people will start using the proper selectors :)
14:05  temp01: is when it starts
14:06  jetienne: Cork: an <input type="text"/> should be able to take focus, no ?
14:06  Cork: jetienne: yes
14:06  Cork: all element can with the help of tabindex
14:06  Cork: input, link, button and a few other can by default
14:06  chris-pc: Hi All
14:06  JenniferB2: is there something similar to an "appendAfter" element method ?
14:07  blackspotwiggins: JenniferB2, after()
14:07  blackspotwiggins: and insertAfter()
14:07  Cork: ?.after
14:07  bot-t: .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
14:07  chris-pc: Just wondering is there a way to close the jquery UI accordian when you click somewhere else or the element is no longer in focus? Thanks
14:07  doonie: sure is, just like hiding a tooltip
14:08  jetienne: blackspotwiggins: Cork: ok thanks, i will investigate further
14:08  malinens: I have submit click event where I make an  ajax request, but I want also request one function  with SetInterval every half second but it does not get requested (I don't get alert). here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/sJufg/  thanks!
14:08  chris-pc: doonie: was that answer for me?
14:09  doonie: yeah
14:09  doonie: just can't remember where in the docs I found some example code
14:09  chris-pc: ill try looking for tooltip :)
14:10  blez: is there a way to use jquery for gui
14:10  blez: as for a desktop app

14:11  doonie: chris-pc basically you need a listener on click for the document, if the target isn't the accordian, collapse it..
14:12  chris-pc: well I was thinking that the focus out could work
14:12  doonie: could be annoying but it should work aswell
14:13  chris-pc: havent used listners in jquery yet (or I dont think so) so could be a bit to learn :)

14:16  Petfrogg: i got a newbie question. I just downloaded one of the themes and i started to work with it - it really nice. The thing is - stuff are to large. I got a font increase/decrease script that works like a charm - but how do i make i start out smaller?
14:16  Petfrogg: i suppose there is a setting since it should be easy to switch between themes.

14:26  dunkel2: by any chance guys, have you worked with email campaigns but by your own. not using a service?
14:26  mahen23: dunkel2: i used to run a service like that
14:26  dunkel2: im trying to find out how to track how many people open my email using some kind of webstats or something
14:26  dunkel2: really? :D so maybe u can help me hehehe
14:27  mahen23: dunkel2: yep, but without that tracking thing
14:27  sean`: dunkel2, they put a <img src="http://mailserver.com/foo.png?email=email@domain.tld"/> in th e html
14:27  dunkel2: yeah well i wantet to do something like that
14:27  sean`: each time it gets pinged they measure an 'opening' and add it to that email address
14:27  sean`: or use uid
14:27  dunkel2: but what web stat can give me that information?
14:27  sean`: but this is definitely not the channel to discuss this
14:27  dunkel2: yeah i knwo that
14:27  dunkel2: :(
14:28  dunkel2: but i knew some of u will know something heheeh
14:28  dunkel2: actually i can do that uuid thing but what i dont know is how to check those stats
14:28  dunkel2: i tried the webstats in my plesk panel
14:29  dunkel2: but seems like it doesnt tell me the exact image pinged it just says "images: ####"
14:29  dunkel2: so thats kind of useless
14:29  dunkel2: for my purposed
14:37  abracsi: does preventDefault not work when you use delegate on multiple child elements?

14:40  abracsi: bug.er
14:43  sean`: abracsi, what do you meanm?
14:43  sean`: preventDefault should work fine
14:43  abracsi: hmm.
14:44  abracsi: this.element.delegate('.sectionalfolder-section','click',this._sectionOpen);
14:44  abracsi:             this.element.delegate('.sectionalfolder-section .record','click',this._recordOpen);
14:44  sean`: dude
14:44  sean`: that's not relevant
14:44  abracsi: no but that's my set up
14:44  sean`: the this.sectionOpen/this.recordOpen is what is intresting
14:45  abracsi: and when i click a record.. it also fires on the sectionOpen
14:45  abracsi: even if i put event.preventDefault() in the recordOpen function
14:46  sean`: abracsi, you need .stopImmediatePropagation
14:46  abracsi: oh man, i'm being an idiot. the clue is in the name
14:46  abracsi: why am i using preventDefault!
14:47  abracsi: sorry, thanks sean, i'll give that a go
14:47  sean`: .preventDefault() prevents the normal thing from happening, .stopPropagation() executes all the events for the current element, but won't let it bubble afterwards, .stopImmediatePropagation() stops all events after the current and cancels bubbling

14:55  jkies00: but if i remove one of the classes, shouldnt the event not fire any more, because the element only has one of the classes?
14:55  doonie: only if you remove the event again
14:55  doonie: as it is already binded
14:55  doonie: it wont auto unbind

17:23  emanu: I don't understand the or-syntax, is it basically that if IS_MOBILE == true, the jquery code doesn't get run?
17:23  acdameli: emanu, if IS_MOBILE is true, the it evaluates to true, if it's false then the other code is executed.
17:23  javecantrell: yeah it's short circuiting
17:23  acdameli: IE) If IS_MOBILE don't bother setting the mouseenter/leave bindings.
17:23  emanu: acdameli: so it's a bit of a hack since the interpreter stops at IS_MOBILE if it's true?
17:24  emanu: is that how that works?
17:24  acdameli: emanu, it's not so much a hack. it's using short ciruiting to ONLY bind if IS_MOBILE is false.
17:24  emanu: ie: how come the code after || never gets looked at?
17:24  acdameli: it's a short version of if (!IS_MOBILE) { bind mouseenter/leave events;}

17:26  Aristata: I keep getting errors but they are not in the code, I don't know how to get this to work because I don't know what's failing
17:26  javecantrell: it's not really proper syntax honestly, I consider it a hack, I think it's not intuitive for people maintaining it
17:26  javecantrell: but short circutiing is what it's commonly called, and is actually what's happening on a low level

17:31  bartek: Hi there. If I am doing an $.ajax() request and the data expected is to be a file attachment, is there any way to make the ajax request cause a browser download?
17:32  losing: Aristata: Can you see the Ajax request in Firebug or Inspector?
17:32  losing: bartek, in that case you do not need to make an Ajax request
17:32  bartek: nevermind, looks like it's not possible
17:33  bartek: losing: I was hoping to do one because the attachment process takes a bit of time (5-10 seconds), so wanted to show a "Loading.." type view
17:34  losing: bartek, perhaps the ajax request could build the file and return a link to download it?
17:34  bartek: losing: that's probably what I'll do .. thanks
17:35  Aristata: losing:  How do you mean?
17:35  losing: What browser are you using?
17:36  Aristata: I have access I am sure, but am unfamiliar with what each thing means.
17:36  Aristata: I use Chrome.
17:36  mekwall: http://writeless.se/ :D and it's up and running... kinda
17:36  losing: Do you know how to use the Chrome developer tools?
17:36  losing: Wrench -> Tools -> Developer Tools
17:37  consumerism: in a form submit function, $(this) is the form right? i want to find the value of one of the inputs. $(this).find('input[name=myname]').val() doesn't work - what should i be doing?
17:37  losing: There is a Network tab that will allow you to see each Ajax request/response
17:37  losing: consumerism: that is correct, can you paste your code?
17:39  Aristata: Ok I will have a look
17:40  consumerism: losing: http://pastebin.com/w27UDMpj
17:40  losing: consumerism: this is a scoping issue
17:40  losing: inside
17:40  consumerism: it's in the middle of a bigger statement on line 10, but in firebug i put a breakpoint in the success function and $(this) is the right object but $(this).find('input') returns nothing
17:41  losing:  the success callback 'this' no longer refers to the form element
17:41  consumerism: ah
17:41  consumerism: do i have to assign it before i define the success function, and use that instead
17:41  consumerism: a different variable
17:41  consumerism: or is there a better way
17:42  losing: http://pastebin.com/B0rujbdp
17:42  consumerism: got it, thanks
17:42  losing: yes
17:44  acdameli: anyone who's interested my problem with jquery.tmpl was that my version was not escaping single quotes in the template before trying to compile... *sigh* Anyone know if that's fixed in newer versions? I just added the replace for it manually and the newer versions of that code makes me want to cry when I try looking at it.
17:47  Altreus: What's a good way of setting up a click handler that only triggers on the background, and not on any actual elements?
17:47  Altreus: I tried binding it to body, but it filters through stuff

17:48  acdameli: (to verify that the target is in fact the body)
