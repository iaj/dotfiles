13:50  fruitwerks: I mean you can send a kml directly to gmaps, but with openlayers you have way more control, and you can do a custom UI
13:51  Qcho: I see
13:51  Qcho: what fruit means
13:51  JuaniOTO: ok, but I don't need a GUI to let users to add setors, what I want is a fixed map with fixed sectors. The problem is that their number is 100 and I dont see a way to generate a KML file or watever
13:51  Qcho: you can use openlayers to draw the polygons
13:51  Qcho: and then export them
13:51  Qcho: to KML file
13:51  JuaniOTO: ahhh
13:52  JuaniOTO: ok, so does openlayer offer a UI for that? Or do I need to create one?
13:52  Qcho: Gmap can use that KML file
13:53  fruitwerks: actually they are best drawn in google earth and exported as kml, from there you can add them to gmaps or integrate them into something like openlayers
13:53  fruitwerks: http://earth.google.com/userguide/v5/ug_drawing.html
13:53  JuaniOTO: ok, I will read all this information and try to get it lear
13:53  JuaniOTO: *clear

13:53  Qcho: you may try this tool
13:53  Qcho: for google maps polygon drawing too

13:54  Qcho: use what suits you best
13:54  JuaniOTO: OHHHH
13:54  JuaniOTO: that one exports to KML, but the one given by fruit (Google Earth looks also what I need)
13:54  JuaniOTO: thanks GUYS!
13:55  fruitwerks: I had a heck of a time with that last link lol
13:55  Qcho: it's kinda geeky
13:55  Qcho: ejjeje
13:56  JuaniOTO: but Google Earth looks to be more user friendly
13:56  fruitwerks: indeed
13:56  Qcho: sure it is
13:59  Qcho: (offtopic) Are u guys using some sort of irc script? i used to have one like ircap or invision ?
14:00  wito: does anyone have any experience with jquery-1.4.2.svg.js?
14:00  Qcho: dont
14:00  fruitwerks: I'm using one called redemption, but it is not the redemption I used to use, but I'm not an op in any channels so I don't actually use any of the script itself lol

15:18  djino: Hi, I have a bunch of links in a page. I have a 'click' event binded to them. It uses $.getScript(this.href) to load content. But it seems that the loaded script is not evaluated in the context of the 'click' event, and 'this' points to the window object, not to the 'a' tag object. Is there a way to augment it?
15:20 --- gat|away is now known as gat
15:20  braddunbar: djino: toss the code up on jsfiddle and i'll take a look
15:27  talented: djino use live() or delegate() for the click event
15:28  talented: also, you may want to use $(this) to refer to the object that called the event

17:10  NET||abuse: ok, so how can I list what plugins are connected to a given jquery instance?
17:10  NET||abuse: have to do this in code
17:15  NET||abuse: ok, so in code how can I list what plugins are connected to a given jquery instance?
17:15  NET||abuse: i can get the version with window.jQuery.fn.jquery
17:15  NET||abuse: but what about listing plugins/
17:16  Do``: you cant do that
17:17  Do``: you can probably test for specific plugins if you know their name and you know what they do (add a method, add a selector, add an event, add an event callback)
17:17  Do``: but plugins dont do anything like jQuery.installplugin(name, functions) so you cant list them
17:19  iratik: I just need some quick help converting some prototype to jquery (not sure which room to ask).  The prototype is $(link).up().insert({ before: content.replace("new_availability",500) }); (where link is a reference to an <a> object)
17:20  enerel: is it possible by jquery set all flashes in iframe set wmode to transparent?
17:20  temp01: iratik: $(link).parent().before(content.replace(..));
17:20  RTPMatt__: i don't really know prototyle, so what exactly does that do?
17:20  iratik: It sucks at what jquery does better ?
17:20  RTPMatt__: @temp01 probably has it
17:20  iratik: … Not sure.. I haven't used prototype in about 5 years
17:22  iratik: I think that worked bud.. thanks!
17:23  enerel: maybe just hide all flashes in iframe by jquery if colorbox is triggered?
17:25 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:28  NET||abuse: Do``: so if i know the name of the pluign i can do if(jQuery.fn.myplugin!==undefined){
17:29  Do``: NET||abuse: assuming the plugin adds a general method to jquery, yes. in any other case, no.
17:29  NET||abuse: ok, well in this case it should be good, but your saying there's not a general way.. that would generally be a nice addition to jQuery.
17:31  Do``: it would completely useless
17:31  Do``: except for debugging like what you're doing
17:31  NET||abuse: true
17:35  enerel: How to set dynamically all flashes in iframe set wmode to transparent? ex: hide all flashes in iframe by jquery if colorbox is triggered
17:36  sean`: why don't you just render with wmode transparent
17:36  sean`: like a normal person
17:37  NET||abuse: Do``: so, would you have a chance to look at what i'm working on?
17:37  NET||abuse: Do``: it's a jquery quarantine in an anonymous function, that would let me load a new version of jquery and plugins inside a private scope.
17:37  NET||abuse: regardless of pre-existing jquery.
17:38  enerel: sean`: The embed are from user generated content, and I can't really get users change the code at embed point
17:40  enerel: But I can not access the document of iframe as its cross domain and I am getting permission denied error

17:50  Hopsy: hmm
17:52  SugaSlide: hmm
17:52  j0hng4lt: I'm using asp.net mvc, which has its own validation implemented in a bare-bones manner. UI details are up to the user
17:52  j0hng4lt: the jQuery validtaion plug-in doesn't have any ui either
17:52  sean`: lol
17:53  sean`: Is it so hard to just do 3 lines of CSS?
17:53  sean`: It generates the error, you just need to position the error element to the accordin position

17:59  j0hng4lt: sean`: I never claimed to be an expert
18:00  sean`: If you want something like this, in the normal world, it's usually called a tooltip
18:00  j0hng4lt: sean`: It's just I tried searching for tooltips and what I got is mouseover tooltips
18:00  j0hng4lt: sean`: not sticky validation messages attached to a field

18:07  sean`: Tomashe, have you tried calling the direct url?
18:08  Tomashe: why?

18:09  Tomashe: wait
18:10  j0hng4lt: dilvie: That's what the asp.net ajax development team called it. It's not a general-purpose mouseover tooltip. It's similar to a tooltip, but it's used to display an error message for a field, and unlike a "normal" tooltip, it stays put until you close it or correct the error.
18:10  NET||abuse: RTPMatt: on line 85 you can see where i'm testing for the jsonp plugin.
18:10  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: hmm, your in with 2 names :)
18:11  RTPMatt__: what would probably be easier than the jQuery assgning stuff you arte doing would be to change the first line to: (function($) {
18:11  RTPMatt__:   and the last line to  })(jQuery);  then you can use $ everywhere
18:12  sean`: j0hng4lt, eff dat, it's a tooltip
18:12  sean`: just accept it
18:12  NET||abuse: RTPMatt: no, this is js for a snippet loaded onto 3rd party site so there's not always jQuery defined already
18:12  dilvie: j0hng4lt: call it what you want. The rest of the world calls it a tooltip.
18:12  dilvie: anyway
18:12  RTPMatt__: left my work computer on ;)
18:12  RTPMatt__: ok
18:12  dilvie: I can't update my plugin an jQuery.com -- "my projects" directs me to a blank page.
18:12  sean`: dilvie, project site is sucky
18:13  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: so i use LABjs to load jQuery if the global scope has no jQuery, or has an older version
18:13  sean`: we're working on a new one
18:13  dilvie: I noticed.
18:13  RTPMatt__: i see

18:13  dilvie: the github downloads will always be current.
18:13  dilvie: later

18:16  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: you get what i'm trying to do here? :)
18:16  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: think it's possible or am i just nuts?
18:17  RTPMatt__: im not sure, still looking at the code, trying to see exactly what you are doing
18:22  denysonique: If I make an ajax request and get HTML on the 'success:' handler.
18:22  denysonique: Is there a way to easily tell whether the images included using <img> tags in that HTML have been loaded? I guess I need attach the HTML to the DOM in order for the images to be loaded. How can I find out inderectly whether the images have been loaded, without checking the images manually.
18:25  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: ok, so the goal is to provide a very simple dropin snippet to a 3rd party site, the js loads LABjs, then it tests for existing jquery, if jquery absent or is different to the required version, labjs loads my jquery, and then should load plugins into the present window.jQuery, then i copy that global scope jQuery into my priavet scope, and replace window.jQuery with a backup if i made one(if jquery was already defined)
18:26  RTPMatt__: yeah, i got it, just trying to make my own test to see what it is doing
18:27  erichynds: denysonique, the net panel of firebug
18:27  erichynds: they won't load until in the DOM
18:27  erichynds: before then it's just a string of data
18:27  denysonique: erichynds, I want to tell
18:27  denysonique: using jquery
18:28  denysonique: so I can display the content only after the image has been loaded
18:28  erichynds: denysonique, you can attach a load event to the images
18:28  erichynds: which will fire once they're done loading
18:28  denysonique: erichynds, e.g. $("img").yourloadevent
18:29  denysonique: erichynds, thus I would need to attach the html to the dom fist
18:29  denysonique: erichynds, good idea, thanks
18:29  denysonique: but I thought there could be a magic way of just telling that!
18:29  denysonique: without directly checking the images
18:36  soee: how can i add "_act" to img source when hover it ?

18:39  RTPMatt__: NET: i think you are checking the wrong thing, i think it is just jQuery.jsonp not jQuery.fn.jsonp

18:45  nidez: i need help.... please
18:45  RTPMatt__: if you look at the unminified source, you can see it is not on $.fn (which makes sense)
18:45  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: obviously i'm looking to go further.
18:45  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: can you paste your modified code?
18:46  RTPMatt__: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/293978/
18:47  RTPMatt__: i modified the script paths to make it work for me
18:48  aws: meh
18:50  NET||abuse: and it's loading up json p for you hmm,
18:50  RTPMatt__: works for me
18:50  RTPMatt__: I also dont have anything else on the page
18:50  NET||abuse: what you think of the idea ?
18:50  RTPMatt__: if you use it just like i have it does it work for you?
18:50  TheVenerableZ: Is it possible to call Event.preventDefault() in a form's .submit() function, where an AJAX call is made in the function?
18:50  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: just checking it to match you version.
18:51  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: but yeh, then it should work for me.
18:51  RTPMatt__: i think it should work, not a terrible idea if you are having to deal with someone elses shitty code
18:51  TheVenerableZ: If I call preventdefault in the function body outside of .ajax, the ajax's success handler fails
18:51  TheVenerableZ: but if I call it in the success handler, the default gets called
18:51  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: well it's to get around when 3rd party site has jquery in use and might be unpredictable how it behaves.
18:52  RTPMatt__: yeah, i think it would be ok for that
18:52  NET||abuse: yay, i won... i did a ton of searching and no-one covered isolating jquery AND loading plugins for the isolated version at the same time :(
18:53  soee: sean`: ok thnx a lot its working
18:54  RTPMatt__: net: it is not really something I have ever thought about doing, but i think it would work, seens interesting
18:55  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: might write it up on my blog at some point.
18:55  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: there's some areas i'd like to look into beyond this point though
18:55  RTPMatt__: NET: yeah, i'm sure your not the first person to have to deal with it
18:57  RTPMatt__: NET: really when you get it working I dont think you will need to test if the plugin was included correctly, in the same way you normaly wouldn't do that
18:59  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: oh sure, of course, was just that json call wasn't working before, so now if it is working, in production of course don't need the console.log calls or the test
19:00  RTPMatt__: ah, cool
19:00  lux`: how can I select an a tag where the text is Next ?
19:01  sean`: lux`, use ?:contains
19:01  bot-t: lux`, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
19:01  sean`: or .filter using .text ()
19:02  lux`: so: $("a:contains(Next)") sean` ?
19:02  sean`: ?tias @ lux`
19:02  bot-t: lux`, Try It And See
19:02  lux`: thanks ;)
19:03  Bartzy: It's OK to have <div>'s and other stuff inside <ul> (and only after the <div>s I have <li> ?)
19:03  Bartzy: or <ul> must contain only <li> child elements ?
19:04  millt: Hi, im trying to replace my old post code with jquery.post.... I am having a little trouble getting the jquery post to work, can someone offer a little advice?   http://pastebin.com/JhFDGK8M
19:08  jamesdean77: can someone look at this very small code, http://pastebin.com/WUCgNnrD, why cant I call a function that is outside a function
19:09  dansnetwork: millt: Your 'url:' isn't much of a url
19:09  millt: dansnetwork is this better?  url: "http://localhost/ws/VisualScriptBuilder/Script"
19:10  dansnetwork: jamesdean77: setTimeout('hideLoading', 3000);
19:10  sean`: dansnetwork, wtf ?
19:10  jamesdean77: i do that but i get a ubdefind
19:10  sean`: jamesdean77, and wtf to you
19:10  sean`: you can't give default arguments to a function
19:10  sean`: cars (foo, bar)
19:10  jamesdean77: undefind
19:11  sean`: cars () will make foo and bar undefined
19:11  sean`: so you need to do cars ('a', 'b') that means, foo will be 'a' and bar will be 'b'
19:11  sean`: also, your setTimeout of 'hideLoading()' is perfectly valid, but you can just as well do setTimeout (hideLoading, 3000)
19:12  jamesdean77: I do that sean Im getting undefind, I'll try again
19:12  sean`: jamesdean77, eff that, pastebin your shit
19:12  jamesdean77: did not use the sigle qoutes though
19:12  sean`: jamesdean77, or even better use ?jsfiddle
19:12  bot-t: jamesdean77, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
19:12  jamesdean77: thanks for the help the morning though
19:12  sean`: jamesdean77, doesn't matter single quotes or double quotes
19:14  Bartzy: It's OK to have <div>'s and other stuff inside <ul> (and only after the <div>s I have <li> ?)
19:14  Bartzy: or <ul> must contain only <li> child elements ?
19:14  sean`: Bartzy, it' the nice thing to do
19:14  SugaSlide: <ul> <li> <divs>
19:15  Bartzy: It's valid not to do it ?
19:15  SugaSlide: ul > div > li is baaaad
19:15  Bartzy: or it slows down the browser rendering some home ?
19:15  Bartzy: SugaSlide: OK, thanks.. can you tell my why ?
19:15  SugaSlide: its not legit
19:15  SugaSlide: wont pass validation
19:15  Bartzy: SugaSlide: It's just that a plugin I use do that.. I can overcome this but wanted to know if it's legit or not
19:15  SugaSlide: and you run into browser issues
19:15  Bartzy: OK thanks a lot. I will change the way it works
19:16  SugaSlide: like some of the browsers if they find something they dont like.. ignore it
19:16  Bartzy: It's jscrollpane, if I tell it to run on a <ul> element, it inserts <div>s between the <ul> and the <li>s
19:16  SugaSlide: soz cant come up with specifics right now
19:16  Bartzy: but I'll just tell it to run on a container that contains the <ul> and not on the <ul> itself
19:17  dansnetwork: jamesdean77: get it to work?
19:17  SugaSlide: http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=416432 @ Bartzy
19:18  xa0z: Hi, I asked a bit ago about setting a cookie using jquery.cookie but I don't think it's working right.   Now the div tag won't load and I don't have any cookies set.

19:19  jamesdean77: missing formal parameter to this function cars('showLoading', 'hideLoading') ?
19:19  dansnetwork: jamesdean77: you don't need to pass those
19:19  jamesdean77: adding sigle qotes to a functin breaks the code
19:20  millt: Why doesnt this work $('#serverResponse').innerHTML = "Received:" + data;   but this does ?document.getElementById('serverResponse').innerHTML = "Received:" + data;
19:20  dansnetwork: jamesdean77: just try removing the arguments all together
19:21  jamesdean77: Dansnetwork; I cant use that IDE, this code is for a open source firewall that is running on another system
19:22  dansnetwork: millt: the jQuery object doen't have 'innerHTML'
19:22  millt: oh

19:23  sean`: ?ud chav
19:23  dansnetwork: millt: $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#serverResponse')[0].innerHTML would work, but not recommended
19:23  bot-t: sean`, chav - Picture this a young lad about 12 years of age and 4 ½ feet high baseball cap at ninety degrees in a imitation addidas tracksuit, with trouser legs tucked into his socks (of course, is definitely the height of fashion). This lad is strutting around, fag in one hand jewellery al over the over, outside McDonalds acting as if he is 8 foot tall and built like a rugby player, when some poor unsuspecting adult (about 17/18) walks r...
19:23  jamesdean77: Im using jqurry Iform with that
19:23  sean`: jamesdean77, setTimeout(hideLoading, 3000);
19:23  sean`: no quotes, READ
19:24  millt: dansnetwork, what would be recommended?
19:24  jamesdean77: lols sorry, morring error
