00:37  m0dmd: can you take a look at http://pastebin.com/7hHacTDE
00:37  m0dmd: I'm already loading data, but I need two values returned .. I can easily return one, with results.
00:38  m0dmd: But I do not know how to turn the results into results.post_date or results.post_ID
00:38  jkatana: make the result equal to a JSON object like { post_date: 'foo', results.post_ID: 'bar' }
00:38  jkatana: whoops remove results. from the post_ID
00:39  jkatana: then you can say function(results) { var r = eval('(' + result + ')'); } or use JSON.parse
00:39  jkatana: and you can say r.post_date and get foo
00:40  snover: jkatana: Did you just suggest someone use eval, with a straight face?
00:40  jkatana: ok I did snicker a bit... rushing out the door at least it might get something working for now
00:41  jkatana: ok I feel bad now. Basically just use JSON.parse
00:42  m0dmd: jkatana so from my autosave, print "{json : 'here', ...}"

00:56  Hory: doesn't default jquery have functions to scroll the content of an overflowing element?
00:57  buddyq: what do you mean scroll?
00:57  Hory: the same thing that would happen by moving a browser scroll bar
00:57  buddyq: could depend on your css style overflow: hidden or overflow: scroll
00:57  Hory: except I want to hide the bar and do my own
00:57  Hory: way of scrolling
00:57  snover: why?
00:57  snover: your own way of scrolling is probably awful.
00:58  snover: no offense, it’s just that they pretty much always are :)
00:59  Hory: because the scrollbar is ugly and I need to scroll by a fixed increment
00:59  Hory: and i need the arrows above and below the element
01:00  Snerf: is there a nice jqueryui replacement for a scrollbar for a div? i found jscrollpane, but then I cant use draggable anymore
01:00  snover: slider
01:01  Hory: Snerf: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll
01:01  croby: any qunit experts in the house?

01:03  rpcesar: is it possible to perform selectors on namespaced items? (non standard html). For instance, when using facebook fbml (prior to parsing), can I do something like $('fb:sometag',holder).attr()?

01:04  croby: pshhhh - alright. I'm having trouble with delayed execution of QUnit tests - I need to wait for an event to fire and then queue up the tests to run, but the tests don't seem to run at all if I start then on an event handler
01:05  snover: croby: do you have a link to your tests, or can you paste testcode? See p
01:05  snover: ?p
01:05  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
01:05  snover: croby: if you are running an asynchronous test, you need to either use asyncTest or call stop() in the same function that you use to bind the event, and then call start() inside the event handler
01:06  croby: snover: I'm not waiting for an event during a test, i'm waiting on one before I start any of my tests
01:06  snover: croby: why?
01:07  croby: i need to wait for data to be loaded before I start it
01:07  croby: snover: when the data is loaded and the object is populated with the data, i fire an event saying that its ready to go, and then would like to start my QUnit tests after that

01:11  ponce: hi, I'm having problems with Jquery UI. I want to have multiple radio group but cannot get them to work together
01:11  ponce: my two radio group "steal" each other focus
01:12  croby: ponce: sounds like they might all have the same name attribute
01:13  ponce: but they do not
01:14  snover: croby: Call QUnit.start()
01:14  croby: snover: inside the event handler?
01:14  snover: after you have added all the tests
01:15  ponce: here is the HTML and javascript to initialize the radio groups http://ideone.com/IonjK
01:15  ponce: i've stripped out the rest
01:16  croby: ponce: all your radios have the same name attribute
01:17  croby: ponce: one group should have one name, the other, a different name
01:17  ponce: oh, i see
01:17  ponce: thanks !
01:17  ponce: wonderful library btw
01:17  ponce: it works o/
01:18  croby: snover: that did it - thank you! Why does that need to be there?
01:18  cohitre: ponce: can i give you some other suggestions?
01:18  snover: croby: because you aren’t actually telling QUnit to start without it.
01:18  cohitre: store the value in the value= attribute of your checkboxes
01:18  snover: croby: if you actually read the source code for QUnit, you will see that it does this automatically for you in an onload handler.
01:18  cohitre: * radios
01:19  cohitre: so that you can do tron.sizeofmap = $(this).val();
01:19  ponce: cohitre: right, i'll do that
01:19  croby: snover: oh interesting -- so because i delay the instantiation of my tests, QUnit.start() isn't ever called after my tests are defined
01:19  ponce: thanks again
01:19  cohitre: after that, give all your checkboxes the same class
01:20  cohitre: and do $(".size-of-map").button().click(....)
01:20  cohitre: so that you don't have to bind the events individually
01:21  ponce: would  $("#m1 #m2 #m3 #4") work too ?
01:21  cohitre: ponce, yes. but a single class makes it easier to add new fields
01:22  cohitre: because you add them in the html and don't have to update the JS
01:22  whltexbread: is there any way to define the desired length of an array when you instantiate it?
01:23  ponce: new Array(n) ?
01:23  cohitre: whltexbread: no.
01:23  cohitre: arrays have a dynamic length.
01:24  whltexbread: Hm, interesting. so you could keep adding elements to the end of an array until you get an out of memory error?
01:24  snover: you bet.
01:26  whltexbread: is there a way too play around in a console without setting up an html file and a script and setting a debug point?

17:02  htrejh: hi
17:02  htrejh: when adding a timer it works, but the browser shows like it's loading forever
17:03  htrejh: is it possible to make a timer that does not let the user think the page is still loading?
17:10  rmurphey: htrejh: can you clarify what you're trying to do?
17:10  rmurphey: ?p @ htrejh
17:10  bot-t: htrejh, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
17:11  htrejh: rmurphey: well no code is needed, when you call setTimeOut() or use .delay() from jquery, the page loading animation of the browser is shown
17:11  htrejh: can you bypass that?
17:11  htrejh: i want to load page content using ajax with delay, without it looks like the page is still loading
17:22  TheIronSky: you should try a loading function
17:23  htrejh: TheIronSky: what do you mean?
17:24  TheIronSky: I googled this in about 3 seconds: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/load-content-jquery-ajax-loading-image/
17:24  TheIronSky: enjoy
17:25  htrejh: TheIronSky: you did interpret wrongly my question
17:25  htrejh: TheIronSky: i am talking about the browser's loading icon
17:25  TheIronSky: what browser
17:25  TheIronSky: and why would you want to do that?
17:26  htrejh: i just dont want
17:26  SugaSlide: the way i see it.. his browsers laoding icon (the spinner thing) keeps turning
17:26  htrejh: but the browser does
17:26  SugaSlide: when he does something
17:26  htrejh: yes, the cursor is also a loading icon
17:26  htrejh: so it isn't really useable
17:26  SugaSlide: so an ajax call thats not completing mebbe?
17:26  htrejh: well it's a timer
17:27  htrejh: i don't know how jquery implements timers, but it lets the browser think the page is still loading
17:27  htrejh: probably using some wait function?
17:27  SugaSlide: jquery doesnt have any timers?
17:28  TheIronSky: jquery has timers
17:28  htrejh: well it's a delay
17:28  htrejh: it's not really a timer
17:28  htrejh: but javascript has setTimeOut
17:28  TheIronSky: ?lmgtfy jquery timers
17:28  bot-t: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+timers
17:28  htrejh: TheIronSky: well it's a plugin...
17:29  jedimind: TheIronSky, if you dont know how to help him, stop being a douche
17:29 * SugaSlide shakes head at TheIronSky
17:29  jedimind: and just keep your retarded lmgtfy comments to yourself
17:29  htrejh: but as i said i used .delay
17:29  htrejh: -> Description: Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue.
17:29  Rantanen: Hum. Not necessarily jQuery specific, but anyone figured out a way to bypass cross domain restrictions on AJAX calls?
17:29  Rantanen: While allowing full REST interfaces?
17:29  jedimind: htrejh, if im not mistaken .delay sets the cursor to wait globally
17:29  Rantanen: (So JSONP is out)
17:29  Hopsy: lol
17:29  Rantanen: And this for development purposes.
17:29  TheIronSky: I don't get your problem. Seems to me our trying to fix something that doesn't need fixing
17:29  jedimind: you would not be able to strip it unless you try to maybe overwrite it with a cursor: auto !Important
17:29  Hopsy: TheIronSky: :D
17:30  Hopsy: atleast you tried
17:30  htrejh: jedimind: and also the browser refresh icon?
17:30  Hopsy: and now disconnect the server :p
17:30  TheIronSky: *You're
17:31  jedimind: htrejh, i dont follow, what does the browser refresh icon have to do with it?
17:31  TheIronSky: see what I mean?
17:31  TheIronSky: it makes no sense
17:31  htrejh: jedimind: http://classicrap.fr/ go to this url if you want to have an idea
17:31  jedimind: asking him to clarify, howeve,r is better than just telling him to google something arbitrary
17:31  SugaSlide: ive had it before with get json
17:32  SugaSlide: the results load... but the browser keeps thinking somehting is open
17:32  SugaSlide: and the loading spinner keeps going
17:32  htrejh: here's my code: http://pastebin.com/K5GXvQZq
17:34  rmurphey: Rantanen: can you use a proxy?
17:34  htrejh: So when the page loads it calls loadOnAirContent which loads the content using ajax and sets a enw timeout to refresj it later
17:34  compaq: I've been at it all day.  I want to dynamically post <form><img src=""/></form> where src = 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg ...until last the jpg, where last one can be anywhere from 5-99.  I tried a for loop, but there is no way to break out of the for loop, I looked into onerror, .error(), and some other stuff with no luck, anyone have an idea?
17:35  Rantanen: rmurphey: The Javascript runs on top of GWT debugging server, don't think that one supports proxies. :<
17:36  Rantanen: Mainly asked in case some of browsers allowed some advanced configuration option that'd circumvent the domain restrictions for certain domains.
17:36  Snerf: compaq, dont use a for loop, try a do/while loop
17:37  compaq: Snerf, hmm, but what condition would I use?
17:37  webben: compaq: "no way"... just test for the existence of the element?
17:38  compaq: webben, how would I do that?  you mean php?
17:38  webben: compaq: No I mean JS.
17:38  Rantanen: rmurphey: Nevermind! It's a Java server so it allows proxy servlets. Thanks, had kinda abandoned that solution already. :)
17:39  webben: compaq: Can't you just loop through the elements matching a selector, e.g. 'form img' ?
17:39  trave: Ive got a draggable, with some of the options being: .draggable({cursorAt: {top:0, left:0}, cursor: 'crosshair'})  ... but in Chrome on Mac, it doesn't honor the crosshair cursor while dragging... works right in firefox.. any tips? :]
17:39  webben: compaq: Or alternately test whether 'img[src="' + n + '.jpg"]' yields something or nothing.
17:42  compaq: webben, if there is no image, and alt is used then src=""?
17:45  compaq: webben, http://jsfiddle.net/4HbEK/ should I give them unigue id's?
17:46  dabear: compaq: you can check if an image is loaded by checking the .complete property
17:46 --- Chainfire_ is now known as Chainfire
17:46  dabear: jQuery("[href='member.php?35095-tg3'] img").attr("complete")
17:46  dabear: for example
17:49  compaq: dabear, I don't have ajax
17:49  dabear: wtf
17:49  dabear: I didn't mention ajax
17:50  dabear: and btw, what you are trying to do is insane
17:50  compaq: dabear, maybe
17:52  webben: compaq: I can't understand your code snippet.
17:52  webben: compaq: It makes reference to variables that aren't defined within it and doesn't really describe what it's trying to do, and doesn't make any mention of posting
17:53  compaq: webben, I know, I just put the for loop in there
17:53  compaq: webben, I am trying what you mentioned anyway, I think it is going to work, let me get back to you in a bit
17:53  webben: ok
17:53  compaq: webben, But I will post more and you can read if you like
18:00  compaq: webben, http://jsfiddle.net/4HbEK/2/ Maybe this one is more clear.  I had some old variables I was using for some other efforts I forgot to remove
18:02  webben: compaq: If there are only 10 images ... where?
18:03  webben: compaq: Can you tell whether there are 10, 15, or 20 images by inspecting information in the DOM/page? Or is this only known by the image server?
18:05  compaq: webben, no, only server knows, because, there are many directories, and some have only 10, some have more it varies
18:06  webben: compaq: Does .select2 refer to some sort of select box where the user selects which images to be shown?
18:07  webben: compaq: You have two decent options: 1. Include the information about how many images are in each directory somewhere accessible in the DOM.
18:07  webben: compaq: or 2. When the user selects which images to be shown, ask the server how many images are in that directory.
18:08  webben: There is another option (try to verify that images exist clientside) but that would be brittle, slow, wasteful.
18:08  compaq: webben, can you check over the id syntax? http://jsfiddle.net/4HbEK/3/
18:09  webben: compaq: "'img#'+test2+i" looks very wrong.
18:09  compaq: webben, I put the class=select2 there, so I can just do $('.select2).remove later
18:09  webben: compaq: What are the ' and ' doing in there?
18:10  webben: compaq: (i.e. why are you quoting img# ?)
18:10  compaq: webben, concatenation
