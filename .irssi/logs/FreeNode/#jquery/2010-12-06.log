00:02  topping: oic what's going on.  i'm using wicket, which is doing DOM manipulation to add elements after the document is rendered… so of course the selector is going to return an empty set.
00:04  JuJuBee: How come submits dont get included when I serialize() a form?
00:05  OhaiBBQ: because input type=submits arent ever sent in post data

00:09  fbjork_: danheberden: yeah something like that
00:09  fbjork_: is that the most efficient way of doing it?
00:09  danheberden: i don't konw if you could get any better for finding if an element is present
00:10  danheberden: i mean, you could use document.getElementById if you were worried about the 60% overhead of jquery (talking 1200 ops per second, but whatev)
00:11  fbjork_: danheberden: I guess I have to start thinking about how to organized my JS
00:12  danheberden: backbone.js, javascriptmvc
00:12  fbjork_: danheberden: i looked at backbone.js, looks great. but I just want that namespacing on top of a rails app

00:36  owen1: coldhead: it's only 1 line: $.getJSON("http://0.0.0.0:9394/display?callback=?",{}, function(data){ console.log(data); });
00:36  coldhead: is that really the IP?
00:36  owen1: coldhead: it's local machine
00:36  coldhead: i'm not sure how browsers feel about that address
00:36  owen1: i am running both the client site and webservice localy
00:37  wookiehangover: coldhead: that's legal
00:37  coldhead: sweet
00:37  snover: 127.0.0.1 is localhost; 0.0.0.0 means “any valid IP”
00:37 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 128 seconds
00:37  owen1: coldhead: when i type http://0.0.0.0:9394/display  i see a json response from my webservice.
00:37  effekt: actually, that's wrong, 0.0.0.0 is an illegal address
00:37  coldhead: well if you guys are so smart what's causing the unexpected token error?
00:37  owen1: ok. i can change it to 127.0.0.1
00:38  marcamillion: why does this not: $("input#f_name").slideDown().css({"display": "visible"}).prepend("<br /><br />");
00:38  marcamillion: specifically the prepend
00:38  effekt: you use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all bound addresses, but you won't be able to connect to it
00:38  marcamillion: everything else works
00:38  owen1: coldhead: changed it to 127.0.0.1. the same error
00:38  coldhead: you guys sure know a lot about networks huh
00:39  owen1: mabye the ?callback=? is not correct?
00:39  effekt: let me see
00:39  coldhead: owen1: when i run that code it doesn't complain for me
00:39  owen1: it was not clear from jquery docs how to use jsonp
00:39  coldhead: did you jsonlint the data its returning?
00:39  danheberden: marcamillion: btw, there's visibility: true and display: block
00:39  owen1: coldhead: no
00:39  owen1: i get 404 from my webservice
00:40  marcamillion: danheberden: not sure what you mean
00:40  danheberden: there is no valid property 'visible' of the display style declaration
00:40  marcamillion: oh
00:40  marcamillion: interesting....so I should set that to 'visibility: true' ?
00:40  owen1: coldhead: so i guess my webservice doesn't have the route?
00:40  danheberden: shouldn't matter for your error, just sayin
00:40  marcamillion: is that a CSS error ?
00:40  marcamillion: thanks for that tip
00:40  danheberden: marcamillion: well slideDown() sets display:block
00:41  danheberden: so you shouldn't have to do anything of that nature
00:41  coldhead: something like that, owen1
00:41  effekt: owen1: if the javascript executes correctly, I have no idea why you'd ask questions about it's failings in #jquery
00:41  owen1: effekt: the error is in my js console- Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
00:41  effekt: owen1: also, the docs seem pretty clear on how to use .json() to me
00:41  JJMalina: could someone explain to my why I can use keys in chrome but not in firefox? here's my code http://jsfiddle.net/Uddzp/
00:42  owen1: effekt: i try to use jsonp, i don't know what the server suppose to return. just a regular json
00:42  owen1: ?
00:42  effekt: owen1: that means that whatever the call to json returned has an unexpected token in it, so whatever your web application returns is invalid and most likely xml/html
00:42  marcamillion: danheberden so how about that prepend
00:42  marcamillion: why would that not be working ?
00:42  owen1: effekt: got it.

00:43  trend: :)
00:43  trend: sec.. i'll find some code for you
00:43  JJMalina: thx
00:44  effekt: owen1: just call the /display route in your browser - if sinatra is anything like rails, you'll be able to append ".js" to it to make it render the javascript reply (by making the browser set the content-type to javascript)
00:46  trend: JJMalina http://pastebin.com/4Nt7w34c
00:47  trend: you don't have to unbind first. unless you are using a heavily ajaxed page
00:47  marcamillion: hrmm....danherberden, jsfiddle doesn't like the form
00:47  marcamillion: it's giving me endless errors
00:47  owen1: effekt: when i ommit the ?callback=? i get different error - Acess-Control-Allow-Origin. that's why i try to use jsonp and not json. /display on the browser return json from my service.
00:48  owen1: effekt: i can't use regular ajax call since my service is on different port than my client.
00:48  coldhead: you're damn sharp effekt, kudos
00:49  effekt: owen1: .json does the same thing - it's all http requests triggered by javascript and they're all bound by the same security restrictions
00:50  effekt: owen1: read up on XMLHttpRequest
00:50  owen1: effekt: i am not sure what u mean when u say .json. do u want me to type this in the browser? http://127.0.0.1:9394/display.json? if i type this: http://127.0.0.1:9394/display i get json back.
00:52  owen1: effekt: if i understand what u'r saying, my sinatra app should return js and not json as the type?
00:53  owen1: can i simply return a json object or do i need to return a js method call since it's jsonp?
00:53  effekt: owen1: it doesn't matter what your app returns, because you can't trigger a http request to a different host and/or port
00:53  owen1: (p for padding)
00:53  owen1: effekt: oh. i thougt jsonp is working around it
00:53  JJMalina: trend: i didnt unbind, although it works now in FF, in both browsers the event goes off without stopping
00:54  effekt: owen1: JSON is a javascript data structure, not a magic flying carpet that circumvents security restrictions
00:55  trend: hmm.. try adding in an event.preventDefault() :/ ?
00:55  trend: I don't really understand
00:55  owen1: effekt: here is snover's reply for my domain issue: If you are not planning on supporting IE, you can use CORS;  otherwise, you will need to use JSONP or proxy requests on the server-side
00:55  trend: it already has bubbled to the top
00:55  aleray: do you know a good lighbox-like jquery plugin that can embed videos as well?
00:56  trend: ohhh, I see what you mean
00:56  owen1: effekt: so during the last hour i was reading about jsonp, assuming i'll be able to make ajax calls to other port

00:56  trend: if you hit hte key more than once back to back?
00:56  RTPMatt: aleray: jqueryUI dialogs or thickbox?
00:56  effekt: owen1: JSONP means that you're retrieving your JSON via <script> tags, which can be on a different host/port
00:57  owen1: effekt: so my webservice will have to return a string with "<script>blababla</script>" ?
00:57  snover: no.

01:12  effekt: owen1: as I said, read up on XMLHttpRequest and the whole ajax shabang ..you'll quickly figure out what's going on, why you can't request offsite, why JSONP is "necessary" and most importantly what you should use .ajax (aka .json, aka XMLHttpRequest) for, etc.
01:12  owen1: effekt: i guess. reading the wikipedia entry for json..

01:30  lithi: yeha saw it
01:30  bweikulrich: use camel case or underscores: forgot_password or forgotPasswordForm
01:30  coldhead: i never got that memo :(
01:30  coldhead: i've been doing it wrong all this time!
01:31  danheberden: i use dolphin case
01:31  ironmagma: coldhead: well good news is it's not wrong :P
01:31  ubuntuisloved: bweikulrich, Camel looks nicer is there a recommended method for not getting names to clash?
01:31  lithi: Umm, how do I know that user isnt focusing to an input anymore?
01:31  lithi: or more like isnt focused*

01:32  RomD: blur.
01:32  alcuadrado: blur is "unfocus" lithi
01:32  lithi: blur?
01:32  lithi: OH
01:32  ubuntuisloved: bweikulrich, also would you say it's a bad idea to start naming tags like this forgotPasswordDiv
01:32  coldhead: oasis
01:32  bweikulrich: ubuntuisloved names should be readable
01:32  lithi: I guess unfocus wouldve been too obvious so why not go with _blur_
01:33  RomD: except unfocus isn't a word
01:33  lithi: Atleast it wouldve made more sense
01:33  bweikulrich: some devs use div in their names
01:34  coldhead: Many programming style guides recommend that method names begin with a strong action verb.
01:34  bweikulrich: ubuntuisloved seems redundant to me, and bad form if you are naming a form forgotPasswordDiv
01:35  ironmagma: coldhead: killForgotPassword?
01:35  coldhead: i would go for class="useramnesia"
01:35  coldhead: for greater job security
01:37  effekt: defocus maybe, or, removeFocus, or what the hell ..blur is fine
01:39  ubuntuisloved: bweikulrich, I was just typing up an example because I wanted to implement proper naming conventions
01:39  bweikulrich: ok
01:39  coldhead: strongActionVerbFocus
01:41  bweikulrich: ubuntuisloved there is no fact in the matter. Its like a citation. Can the reader tell what you are trying to accomplish. Is the formatting correct; that is what matters
01:44  JuJuBee: When I do $("div#messageDiv").show().fadeOut(100000);  the div shows and then disappears in the blink of an eye.
01:45  bweikulrich: Cool
01:45  ironmagma: JuJuBee: try breaking it into two statements?

01:46  coldhead: maybe drop a delay() after the show?
01:46  ironmagma: JuJuBee: maybe fade it in real quick, then use a callback to fade it out?
01:46  ironmagma: ?show

01:47  mike817: I have a form i'm submitting with ajax. everything works fine, but if the user wants to submit the form again, the javascript doesn't fire
01:47  mike817: any idea why?
01:48  ironmagma: mike817: doesn't sound like an inherent javascript problem. try posting your code
01:48  ironmagma: mike817: in a pastebin, that is.
01:49  coldhead: you shouldnae have to use the callback
01:49  JuJuBee: ironmagma: same behavior
01:49  l4rk: ironmagma: overspecifying selectors is a big no no
01:50  l4rk: #messageDiv is arguably better
01:50  ironmagma: JuJuBee: fadeOut(100000, void) ?
01:50  ironmagma: because it looks like jquery requires a callback, from the docs.
01:51  l4rk: if it requires a callback, use $.noop not void
01:51  mike817: ironmagma: http://pastebin.com/t7SnJahE
01:51  coldhead: ironmagma: http://jsfiddle.net/tLcBU/ works fine for me
01:52  JuJuBee: ironmagma: This is my js...   http://pastie.org/1350931
01:52  JuJuBee: void did not work either
01:52  l4rk: ...
01:52  ironmagma: yeah void is not a real function evidently :P
01:52  l4rk: forget it
01:52  coldhead: JuJuBee: http://jsfiddle.net/tLcBU/
01:53  ironmagma: JuJuBee: you made dataString a global variable by not using var. try adding var to the beginning of the line and see if that helps?
01:54  ironmagma: l4rk: does the selector match more than one thing, or something?
01:55  l4rk: no it just runs it through sizzle instead of passing it off to getElementBYId
01:55  l4rk: which doesn't really matter so much
01:55  l4rk: but gEBI is more pure imo
01:55  coldhead: more racially pure?

01:55 --- elpancho is now known as jedimind
01:55  ironmagma: JuJuBee: nevermind, I just missed the declaration
01:56  JuJuBee: coldhead: ok, and what does that show?  that it IS supposed to be working?
01:56  ironmagma: oh
01:56  ironmagma: JuJuBee: it may have to do with using html() to replace the contents. note that modifying an element's innerHTML breaks all references to the objects in that element.
01:56  ironmagma: JuJuBee: so you're probably breaking the reference to the submit button, or something.
01:57  JuJuBee: so how should I populate the div?  innerHTML ?
01:59  ironmagma: JuJuBee: I don't know what you mean; what I'd do instead of *replacing* the submit button is just hide it, and display an image instead.
01:59  kenno: I have a small problem with displaying simple tooltip
01:59  kenno: http://www.jsfiddle.net/4F4Lk/1/
01:59  ironmagma: JuJuBee: so you are never removing the submit button or adding anything to the document tree.

02:15  ironmagma: PhonicUK: IE has (in the past at least) had this weird intolerance for stuff in between <script> and </script> when loading an external file. make sure you don't have anything between the start and end tags.

02:23  l4rk: owen1: provide a link next time
02:23  l4rk: i had to google and click it oh dear!

02:23  l4rk: oh its the jsonp padding
02:24  l4rk: p for padding
02:24  l4rk: xD

02:36  JuJuBee: http://jsfiddle.net/p4nvR/  why doesn't this work?
02:37  Fernandos: it has somehow to do with the reset stylesheet. I have an image with a semi transparent span overlay which is centered and linked. however, clickin it makes the span animate and center vertically..
02:37  Fernandos: removing the reset stylesheet solved it..
02:39  dilvie: $('#jquery').html('Rocks');
02:41  Lumpio-: I'd prefer .text
02:42  topping: JuJuBee: it's because the "choose framework" on the left is set incorrectly
02:42  dilvie: Lumpio-:  That's an interesting opinion.
02:43  JuJuBee: topping: ok, I got it working in my browser locally.
02:43  JuJuBee: Still don't know why it isn't working (the fadeOut) on my site...
02:43  l4rk: yeah its interesting that you'd use a function called text to set text XD
02:43  quizme: ok nm it works :)
02:43  quizme: forgot a comma, lol
02:44  dilvie: Lumpio-: but generally, I'd be replacing that string literal with a variable, and it seems silly to arbitrarily limit the contents of it to a text node. What if you want to change the presentation of that text later and need to attach a child element?
02:44  JJMalina: anyone able to help me with jQuery question on stackoverflow? i appreciate it! http://bit.ly/fD4VfB

02:45  l4rk: JJMalina: that is all sorts of effed up
02:46  l4rk: i think it would take a while for me to write a solid reply
02:46  JJMalina: l4rk: sorry?
02:46  l4rk: Just saying
02:46  l4rk: i hope someone is able to go through all the wrong things and get you some fixed code
02:46  danheberden: JuJuBee: submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();
02:46  danheberden: a bit more descriptive than return false
02:48  JJMalina: l4rk: it's a pretty simple problem is it not?
02:48  l4rk: well your yeah, but your code is anything but a simple problem
02:49  danheberden: lol @l4rk
02:49  MagusOTB: using $(this) inside an event callback (i.e. droppable({drop: ) refers to the thing recieveing the event, right?
02:50  Rufus: Greetings. I'm using http://designshack.co.uk/tutorials/creating-a-virtual-jquery-keyboard "linked" to an autocomplete script. Is there a way I could change the layout of the keyboard triggered by an onClick event ?
02:50  mike817: ironmagma: are you saying that replacing the submit button is the problem?
02:52  quizme: the flickr api doesn't return json.  it returns a function call: jsonFlickrApi({"photos" : {"page": 1 .....)
02:52  quizme: how do i strip away the function call part and just get the json ?
02:53  danheberden: quizme: use $.ajax({ dataType: 'json', callback: 'jsonFlickrApi'
02:54  quizme: ohh
02:54  danheberden: sorry, dataType: 'jsonp'
02:54  quizme: danheberden thanks
02:55  danheberden: MagusOTB: yeah, in reference to what you bound it to.. e.g. $('a').click(function() { $(this) == the a element that fired the click event
02:56  owen1: snover: it's working but i am still not clear about the why. the .ajax generated this element in my dom: <script src="http://127.0.0.1:9394/display?callback=parseResponse&amp;callback=jsonp1291600262313"></script>.   it it making the call and store the object that is returned in the src attribute?
02:56  danheberden: owen1 - thats how jsonp works
02:57  owen1: btw, in my success attribute i still had to call parseResponse(data) ..
02:59  owen1: danheberden: yeah, but the wikipedia page said it invokes the method. in my case i had to invoke it myself in the success attribute of the object i passed to .ajax()
02:59  danheberden: owen1, did you specify that callback in your request?
02:59  danheberden: in the case of a traditional jsonp request, the callback is provided and placed into the return script, e.g. jquery21394839242({json shit
03:00  owen1: danheberden: yes - http://pastebin.com/0ysVS2vh
03:00  danheberden: so put callback: 'parseResponse'
03:00  danheberden: not as the url
03:01  danheberden: you need to let jquery know what it is
03:01  danheberden: cuz jquery is sending a callback of it's own (since you haven't specified) and is calling that function
03:01  danheberden: which doesn't work, as you've seen
03:01  owen1: danheberden: the code works now, but let me try adding the callback
03:02  danheberden: oh, wrong key
03:02  danheberden: sry, 'jsonpCallback'
03:02  owen1: danheberden: ok. should i remove the success attribute?
03:02  danheberden: no not at all
03:03  Fernandos: I'm coding since 3days on several projects, hardly slept and am stuck at a point.. would you mind helping me out with this? http://jsbin.com/uhuki3/6/edit I cannot find why it doesn't filter the other items.
03:03  owen1: danheberden: so i still need line 6 - parseResponse(data); ?
03:03  danheberden: http://pastebin.com/rpeU2paT
03:03  danheberden: nup
03:03  Fernandos: It's only working for "all", "toro" and "toro plus" nothing else. (only works the first click, for the other elements)
03:03  owen1: nice. let's see
03:04  dnyy: this isn't a jquery as i'm trying to do it without jquery, but i can't find the answer anywhere else. is it possible to set a new attribute to an element without a value (selected instead of selected='selected')?
03:04  danheberden: typically a jsonp script will replace "parseResponse" with whatever the provided callback attribute was
03:06  danheberden: dnyy, gonna need some context there kiddo - as for a select item, you can set it's selectedIndex on the select element itself
03:06  owen1: danheberden: your version doesn't execute the function
03:07  dnyy: danheberden: Well, for example, I'm itterating over every input field on the page. I want to add the attribute 'speech', but not 'speech="speech"'.
03:07  dnyy: but, using setAttribute requires a second argument fo rthe value, and if you don't set one, it does speech="", which is still not what I need.
03:07  Fernandos: what I'm trying to achieve is quite similar to this http://razorjack.net/quicksand/demos/attribute.html but without the ajax bit
03:08  danheberden: dnyy, you don't want speech="speech" or speech="", what _do_ you want?
03:08  l4rk: just speech
03:08  dnyy: danheberden: heh, sorry, i want only 'speech'
03:08  l4rk: which is technically valid just not via dom afaik
03:08  dnyy: i've been attempting this for like a hour, it might not even be possible to do
03:09  owen1: danheberden: and i also try to add <script type="text/javascript" src="http://127.0.0.1:9394/display?callback=parseResponse"></script>  to my code manually and it also not calling it.
03:09  danheberden: what does it matter if it's an empty string then?
03:09  dnyy: danheberden: for whatever reason, chrome's speech type gets treated different if theres an empty string/value there than if there's nothing
03:09  kersny: like this: http://slides.html5rocks.com/#slide24?
03:09  dnyy: kersny: exactly
03:09  danheberden: dnyy - try attr('speech', null) ?
03:09  danheberden: or udnefined
03:09  coldhead: OFF TOPIC does anyone know of any good irc channels for catholic saints chat?
03:10  dnyy: by having no value, it aligns the mic to the right, if a value is there it aligns left (covering the input text)
03:10  coldhead: sorry wrong window
03:10  dnyy: danheberden: have tried both, neither work. :/
03:10  danheberden: dnyy elem[0].speech = null;
03:10  danheberden: past that, donno what else you could possibly do
03:11  danheberden: but if it's a dom attr
03:11  danheberden: should be true or false
03:11  danheberden: where in html markup, speech="speech" results in domNode.speech = true
03:11  dnyy: hrm, i have no idea then
03:11  dnyy: false does nothing either. going to try .speech = null
03:12  danheberden: so you want to turn the attr off or on?
03:12  dnyy: i want the attribute to stay there, just with no =""

03:13  Fernandos: lol
03:13  danheberden: owen1: i'm not sure what to say re: your callback problem then :(
03:13  Fernandos: coldhead: only vips :P
03:13  coldhead: damned exclusive eternal salvation :(
03:15  Fernandos: does the eq(1) mean that it looks for the 2nd ul within ul.splitter=  var $controls = $('ul.splitter'); var sorting_type = determine_sort($controls.eq(1).find('a'));
03:15  danheberden: Fernandos: 0 based index, yes
03:16  Fernandos: ok.. I've only one ul.. so that part isn't making sense..
03:16  danheberden: and not 'within' ul.splitter, it gets the second ul of the group
03:16  danheberden: Fernandos: if you only have one, then use eq(0)
03:17  danheberden: or just kill the eq() all together if you only have one
03:18  Fernandos: danheberden: when I remove that it won't work anymore.. as said.. I've no good concentration anymore..this is my code would be happy if you could help me a little http://jsbin.com/uhuki3/6/edit
03:18  Fernandos: I think it starts to bug after if (sorting_type == 'toro') {
03:18  amikrop: If you call .remove() on an element on which previously you have called .hide(), it doesn't get removed.
03:18  amikrop: Is that a known bug?
03:19  danheberden: ?ldoidh @ amikrop
03:19  bot-t: amikrop, Live Demo Or It Didn't Happen - http://jsfiddle.net - http://pastebin.me - http://jsbin.com
03:19  Fernandos: not that I know amikrop
03:19  danheberden: removing nodes and hiding them are two seperate tasks
03:20  danheberden: Fernandos: so that line is ul.splitter ul
03:20  danheberden: so it finds ul's inside of ul.splitter
03:21  amikrop: Fernandos: ok, how can I var_dump a jQuery element?
03:21  danheberden: which looks to be only one, yes?
03:21  amikrop: Fernandos: so I can test it?
03:21  amikrop: Fernandos: I mean, a jQuery object
03:21  Fernandos: amikrop: alert it. or try console.log(msg); 
03:21  Fernandos: where msg is your variable
03:21  danheberden: and too, Fernandos, you know you can declare multiple vars in one var statement, right?
03:21  amikrop: Fernandos: if I alert it I only get Object objecft
03:22  Fernandos: amikrop: helpful if you use firebug
03:22  danheberden: var $control = $(this), $data = $list.clone();
03:22  danheberden: Fernandos: in your $buttons click function, you explicitly reference eq(0) and eq(1)
03:22  danheberden: when there is only one ul
03:22  danheberden: why?
03:23  Fernandos: I tried to adapt the basic example to my html, which didn't really work
03:23  amikrop: console is not defined
03:24  amikrop: (I use Firebug)
03:24  danheberden: make sure your console tab is open first
03:25  Fernandos: amikrop: also this could be handy http://ajaxian.com/archives/jquery-logging
03:28  Fernandos: danheberden: hmm I see the if and else after if (sorting_type == 'toro') doesn't make any sense.
03:28  quest88: if I have a jquery objec that's a form how can I access the form fields using the name only?
03:29  alcuadrado: amikrop: I would add a check for console to that ajaxian fn linked by Fernandos, and if not defined just return =)
03:29  trend: form.find("input[name='email']").val() ?
03:30  amikrop: alcuadrado: can't I just alert the element name of my jQuery selection?
03:30  amikrop: alcuadrado: isn't there a $('#someid').name or something?
03:30  alcuadrado: amikrop, alert just sucks for debugging porpuses =)
03:31  alcuadrado: $("#myElementWithName").attr("name")
03:31  pifantastic: I am trying to add custom buttons to a page header in jQuery mobile, but it seems that when I call changePage() they are removed
03:31  quest88: I'll try the first once I clean some stuff up
03:32  MagusOTB: Is there something strange about addClass()? I'm trying to use it to highlight a element, and when U ise $(sel).css({'background-color':'red') it works, but $(sel).addClass('selectedPart') where selectedPart is defined in the CSS file to have a red background, it does not.
03:32  amikrop: alcuadrado: will that output the HTML name of the element? like "div" or "span" or "p"?
03:32  MagusOTB: *when I use
03:32  alcuadrado: amikrop: no, the element name attribute
03:32  alcuadrado: you want the tagName
03:33  Fernandos: amikrop: you could learn howto dbug http://getfirebug.com/javascript when you click on documentation you can find out howto inspect objects too
03:33  quest88: alcuadrado, looking at your first example would work but only if it's an input type
03:33  amikrop: ok thanks
03:34  quest88: but I'm looking for any element with that given name inside a form
03:34  alcuadrado: quest88, which example? I was talking to amikrop, sorry
03:34  trend: form.find("input[name='email']").val()
03:34  quest88: that example
03:34  quest88: that trend said
03:35  alcuadrado: $form.find("[name='myName']")
03:35  alcuadrado: where $form is the jquery-selected form
03:36  quest88: all right, I'll give that a shot
03:37  quest88: Awesome, exactly what I needed.
03:37  quest88: thanks
03:39  alcuadrado: never mind =)
03:41  Fernandos: danheberden: well, I removed the unneccsary if/else statements, but somehow it doesn't work anymore now new: http://jsbin.com/uhuki3/7/edit old: http://jsbin.com/uhuki3/6/edit
03:42  Fernandos: after going through the code I thought the first if/else should catch all filter buttons
03:44  Fernandos: ah.. k $sorted_data doesn't exist anymore and it can't get passed as parameter to $list.quicksand($sorted_data, $preferences); ..
03:45  Fernandos: but how do I fix it then..?
03:46  devinrolsen: evening
03:47  trend: hey
03:49  fbjork_: is it possible to attach handlers to a dom id like this: $('div[data-remote]').load() ?
03:49  fbjork_: I want a default bevaior for all divs with a data-remote attribute
03:49  JuJuBee: what does an ajax parsererror usually lead to?
03:50  trend: fbjork, yeah
03:52  fbjork_: trend: how? onload isn't triggered for divs
03:52  trend: oh, sorry.. I thought you were asking if it was possible to attach handlers to arbitrary node attributes
03:53  trend: I don't think you cna
03:54  trend: not this way anyways.. you are trying to add an evt handler to something that isn't there yet
03:54  fbjork_: i'd like to trigger an event for a divs that have a specific data element, what's the best way to accomplish that?
03:55  trend: or is the div there, but, just not populated yet (but will be via an $.ajax call)
03:55  fbjork_: trend: the div is there during render time
03:55  fbjork_: exactly
03:55  fbjork_: i want to trigger an ajax event for all divs with data-remote="true"
03:57  alcuadrado: explain more about that fbjork_
03:57  trend: why not just use $.ajax 's success:function(){ $('div[data-remote]').html("loaded"); }  fn?
03:57  trend: yeah, I'm pretty sure I have done what you have done.. just not sure what tool to show you :P
03:59  trend: done what you want*
03:59  fbjork_: trend: so I have several divs on a page and i've added a href="ajax-url" and data-remote="true" to it. I want to trigger an ajax call that does the same for all divs with those attributes
03:59  fbjork_: i have the success functions in place and working now

04:12  Fernandos: ajpiano: that's not my code, I'm not that good with jquery, it's from the example on http://razorjack.net/quicksand/ I tried to filter for more than two items, but failed
04:12  _numbers:  my page elements (e.g. header, page) are styled. when i click my dialog link, the html is loaded via ajax and the transition is used to display it--but other than a black background the buttons on the dialog are not themed
04:12  ajpiano: Fernandos: well it certainly isn't my code
04:12  ajpiano: and jquery 1.4.1 is a stupid version of jquery to use
04:12  ajpiano: and Fernandos, that's an awful lot of code to throw at someone with a "doesn't work" attached

05:44  SliMM: I've been playing with the valdiate plugin for jQuery for a bit and I can't seem to figure out how to disable the output...
05:44  SliMM: Any suggestions?
05:45  coldhead: SliMM: i think you disable the output by providing custom error handlers
05:45  coldhead: and it uses them instead of the default
05:46  coldhead: but if you're lazy you can just spot the class it uses for its output <label class="error"> or whatever and go label.error {display:none;}
05:50  SliMM: coldhead: I managed to do it the proper way :p
05:51  SliMM: coldhead: Any idea what support it has for date validation?
05:52  coldhead: i assume very little

06:31  morris: try 4chan.com
06:32  Lumpio-: nathanial: You call yourself a programmer but you can't think of a single website that lets you upload images?
06:32  nathanial: dude that's not cool
06:32  Lumpio-: Or even worse, of a single website that might help you find one!?
06:33  Lumpio-: No, you're not cool.

06:33  alystair: what's the recommended method to make a  mouseenter/leave ignore sub elements?
06:33  bot-t: nathanial, Welcome to Gyazo : Seriously Instant Screen-Grabbing - http://gyazo.com/en
06:33  KevinM: Hello, #jquery! Is it possible to have a map's key be a variable?
06:33  Lumpio-: alystair: Isn't that what they do?
06:33  alystair: as soon as I reach the edge of the object it creates a giant enter/leave cascade
06:33  Lumpio-: KevinM: What's a map
06:33  alystair: because the size of the object is changing
06:34  Lumpio-: alystair: I don't think your problem is ignoring sub-elements. That's what mouseenter/leave do innately (that's why they exist separately from mouseover/out)
06:34  KevinM: Lumpio-, http://docs.jquery.com/Types#Map
06:34  alystair: ah so I just gotta do over/out
06:34  Lumpio-: KevinM: That's not a real type, that's just the param spec for a function...
06:35  Lumpio-: alystair: mouseover/out will always get you more events than mouseenter/leave
06:35  alystair: nope still creating cascading mess
06:35  Lumpio-: Read what I said properly
06:35  Lumpio-: alystair: Let me guess, you're changing the side of the element while the mouse is near the edge
06:35  KevinM: Lumpio-, So i need to use jQuery.map to create one?
06:35  alystair: lumpio: yep
06:36  Lumpio-: KevinM: Eh, what? That's a completely different thing!
06:36  alystair: am I going to have to do some sort of quasi proximity code thing to get around this?
06:36  Lumpio-: alystair: Well, it sounds the events are working correctly
06:36  Lumpio-: sounds like*
06:36  KevinM: Lumpio-, then what function does the Map type wrap to?
06:36  Lumpio-: Maybe you shouldn't be binding them to the element itself
06:36  Lumpio-: But rather the document, or something like that
06:36  coldhead: ?ba debounce
06:36  bot-t: Don't fire that event any more than you have to! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/

06:37  nathanial: exit
06:37  coldhead: lol nathanial
06:37  Lumpio-: KevinM: As far as I can see, map is not an actual type but more like a param spec for a function
06:37  Lumpio-: I don't see why they call it a type
06:37  Lumpio-: I mean, just read beyond the title
06:37  morris: Lumpio: how about using a transparent div over the image and register the events upon the transparent div?
06:37  Lumpio-: It says "it could be a string, or an object, or a jQuery object, or..."
06:37  Lumpio-: morris: What image?
06:38  morris: Lumpio: Ahh - a transparent div over your element. Put the map on the transparent div. A workaround - but might do what you want?
06:39  Lumpio-: morris: You're not making any sense whatsoever.
06:39  morris: Lumpio: Oh well. Sorry.
06:39  Lumpio-: You sure you're not confusing two questions with each other?
06:39  Lumpio-: I mean, we had one person asking about "map" and one asking about events
06:39  Lumpio-: But those were two separate discussions
06:39  morris: Lumpio: sorry - that was meant for aylstar.
06:40  Lumpio-: You mean alystair?
06:40  coldhead: okay everyone stay calm
06:40  coldhead: i've called your parents

06:56  Fernandos: hmm I've a line of jquery code that I don't understand.. could you please explain where that replace function comes from? var dataType = $(this).find('span.field-content a').text().replace(/ /g,'').toLowerCase();
06:56  Lumpio-: Megalong!
06:57  Lumpio-: Fernandos: "where"?
06:57  Lumpio-: It's just String.replace
06:57  Lumpio-: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
06:57  Fernandos: lol I thought it's a jquery function..
06:57  Lumpio-: You know, methods built-in to the /language itself/ are something you should really know before touching jQuery
06:57  Lumpio-: Well, you ought to know what .text returns
06:57  Fernandos: what does that replace(/ /g,''). mean? the double slashes and the g?
06:58  Lumpio-: And (hopefully) also know that jQuery doesn't like extending built-in types, so it's quite likely that the string method is not from jQuery
06:58  Lumpio-: It's a regular expresson
06:58  Lumpio-: expression
06:58  coldhead: // delimits a regular expression, g means globally, not just the first occurence
06:58  Lumpio-: Which just matches a space.
06:58  Lumpio-: And the "g" means "all occurenecs"
06:58  coldhead: better read a regex tute babycakes
06:58  Lumpio-: ...which coldhead just said
06:59  Fernandos: that regex won't match to this, even if I adjust the selector, right? <span class="desc">Test</span>
06:59  Lumpio-: what
06:59  Lumpio-: Well no, it won't find a space from that string
07:00  Lumpio-: Assuming that you adjust your selector to actually match that span
07:00  Lumpio-: So it'll just return "test"
07:00  Fernandos: hmm
07:05  Fernandos: uff.. it's not matching..
07:06  Fernandos: :(
07:07  Fernandos: I'm stuck with the regex var dataType = $(this).find('span.desc').text().replace("/ /g",'').toLowerCase();
07:10  Lumpio-: Fernandos: ...why did you add those quotes
07:10  Lumpio-: Are you looking for the characters "slash, space, slash, the letter g"?

07:21  coldhead: i love when the jquery docs talk about "we"

07:21  wookiehangover: the royal "we"
07:21  coldhead: like k-swed is helping me personally with my problems

07:22  Fernandos: honestly the jquery community is the most open one out there compared to the amount of free stuff and plugins offered out there
07:22  owen1: value.
07:23  owen1: so i thought of using .each and breaking after 1 iteration
07:23  coldhead: that sounds like it would work
07:24  owen1: with return false; ?
07:25  coldhead: owen1: http://jsfiddle.net/3qetK/
07:25  coldhead: that works for good data

08:45  snollux: ServerSage: how do you mean?
08:45  snollux: also, is $.post not orthodox jquery? is there another way to do it aside from that?
08:46  ServerSage: snollux: jquery.post()
08:47  ServerSage: snollux: And by consistency I mean be consistent in how you write code.  Put your opening curly always on a new line, or on the same line.  Don't mix it up.  That sort of stuff.
08:51  snollux: yeah, ServerSage, that's what I get for trying to use an autoformatter

09:21  snollux: understandable.. If you do get a chance later and you aren't too busy, I'd really appreciate your taking a look
09:21  ajpiano: snollux: here's a hot tip, when you make a demo, make one that actually demonstrates the error happening
09:21  snollux: if not, that's obviously understandable
09:21  snollux: ajpiano: hard to migrate the sql/php interaction to jsfiddle but thanks for the protip
09:21  ajpiano: the idea that jQuery would be fine and then undefined in a callbak is pretty mysterious
09:21  snollux: ajpiano: that it is.
09:21  ajpiano: and it's also pretty mysterious why you switch between $ and jQuery
09:22  snollux: I used only $ at first but then someone told me to try jQuery instead
09:22  snollux: i'll make them all consisten
09:22  snollux: t
09:22  snollux: bad oversight there
09:22  snollux: but in theory, not sure why that would make a difference
09:22  ajpiano: it won't
09:22  ajpiano: you should like, pause a debugger
09:23  ajpiano: inside of the callback and see if $ and jQuery are defined
09:25  temp01: you aren't preventing form submission when doing $.post
09:31  snollux: temp01: oops
09:31  snollux: I thought that's what return false did
09:31  snollux: maybe not
09:31  snollux: :\
09:32  JKarsrud: not inside a post callback, no. You should do it inside your submit callback
09:36  JKarsrud: snollux: Inside the post callback the post has already happened
09:36  NYCPower: Can I use jquery to async POST a  form to a different domain?
09:36  snollux: JKarsrud: I see, that makes sense. hence why jquery no longer exists?
09:37  JKarsrud: I have no idea about that problem, good sir, but I thing there's something else wrong right there.
09:37  JKarsrud: think, even
09:38  JKarsrud: Do you have an updated fiddle?
09:39  snollux: thanks JKarsrud, you fixed it
09:39  snollux: :)
09:39  snollux: ^___^
09:39  JKarsrud: sweet! :)
09:40  snollux: backup time!
09:40  snollux: lol
09:40  JKarsrud: actually, temp01 fixed it as usual, I just helped you along a bit more :)
09:40  snollux: temp01: yes you too
09:40  snollux: and ajpiano and ServerSage
09:40  snollux: all very patient and helpful
09:40  snollux: :)
09:41  snollux: tar.bz2'ing the hell out of that dir
09:41  JKarsrud: Do eet
09:41  snollux: doing did done

09:42  snollux: but I assume it's day for you?
09:42  JKarsrud: Norway, so it's 9:45 am
09:42  snollux: Karsrud almost sounds Danish or Germa n
09:42  snollux: aah
09:42  snollux: Danish was close
09:42  mekwall: Hiya dudettes! Anyone sitting on a good resource on authoring jquery plugins that doesn't use/need a selector?
09:42  JKarsrud: Danish was close, yeah ;)
09:42  mekwall: Norwegian!
09:42  snollux: I'm American, but of Danish ancestry
09:42  snollux: SVENSK!
09:43  ajpiano: mekwall: what do you mean
09:43  mekwall: ajpiano: $.blah()
09:43  ajpiano: that's not a jquery plugin
09:43  snollux: last name is gammel norsk as all hell (Hvammur)
09:43  ajpiano: it's a function that happens to be stored as a property of window.jQuery
09:43  ajpiano: there are no guidelines for that
09:43  ajpiano: except for like, maybe you don't need to put it there in the first place
09:44  mekwall: ajpiano: hrm ok... well I am authoring a plugin that has a couple of functions that doesn't need to be attached to an element
09:44  ajpiano: but those functions also need to public??
09:44  mekwall: can perhaps call it with $.fn.blah() ? :)
09:44  ajpiano: huh
09:44  ajpiano: no
09:45  ajpiano: why can't you just use a private function in the closure
09:45  mekwall: ajpiano: they are, but I would have to pass an element to access them?=
09:45  mekwall: I mean, I have to access them from outside as well
09:45  ajpiano: and you want them to be associated with the element instance
09:46  ajpiano: not just like $.foo(elem), right?
09:46  ajpiano: cause yes, anything you just stick on $ you're gonna need to pass an element to to make it work
09:46  mekwall: ajpiano: no... it's a data collection plugin that can be used to return data for use in other places
09:46 --- _iain is now known as Backie
09:46  mekwall: ajpiano: those functions can be called without association or with association
09:47  ajpiano: oh
09:47  ajpiano: then it's not unreasonable to put it on $.
09:47  ajpiano: like
09:47  mekwall: $.blah('test') or $('div').blah('test');
09:47  ajpiano: a lot of core jquery stuff does work like that
09:47  ajpiano: like $(elem).data("foo") is just $.data(elem,"foo");
09:47  mekwall: mhm
09:47  ajpiano: where the $.fn part is just a wrapper to put the actual functionality on jquery collections
09:48  ajpiano: so yeah, that would be the way you should architect it
09:48  ajpiano: $.foo does all the heavy lifting
09:48  ajpiano: and $.fn.foo just takes care of iterating and delegating to the $.foo
09:48  mekwall: alrighty
09:48  mekwall: I'll throw together an example :)
09:49  mekwall: got it on jsfiddle already

10:10  torbjorn: Im using ev.ctrlKey
10:10  torbjorn: are there different methods for different browsers for ctrl key?
10:14  ironmagma: torbjorn: see what the keyCode is in both instances
10:14  ironmagma: also, which IE?
10:16  torbjorn: ie 8, im checking keycode
10:16  Pjom: im using window.location.hash = ui.panel.id; to change my browser url
10:17  Pjom: but in IE the page moves (i think due the #tab1) in the url
10:17  Pjom: is there a way to disable it?
10:18  RandomSo1t: strip the # out of it
10:18  Pjom: yeah but i need it :)
10:18  torbjorn: it seems it doesn't catch ev.ctrlKey
10:18  prism: wait you can actually change the url bar at the top with js?
10:18  prism: without actually redirecting the page
10:18  Pjom: yeah well... it only happens in IE
10:18  prism: ah damnit
10:19  Pjom: when clicking on a tab i want to change the url with the active tab: index#tab1 / index#tab2 etc
10:27  Mimo: hi ppl, how can i measure performance of jquery snippets like $('#id').find('.myclass') vs $('#id .myclass') (i know the first one is faster, i only want to measure snippets like that)
10:28  blackspotwiggins: Mimo, jsperf.com
10:28  Mimo: thank u blackspotwiggins
10:33  torbjorn: seems I cannot capture ctrl + S
10:33  torbjorn: in IE 8
10:35  beasty: torbjorn: can you nopaste the script u are using ?
10:37  beasty: torbjorn: or are you using a plugin ?
10:37  torbjorn: no plugin
10:38  arrr0w: Mimo:  $('#id').find('.myclass') is faster
10:38  Mimo: haha thanks arrr0w quote from my line of text "i know the first one is faster, i only want to measure snippets like that"
10:39  Mimo: but anyways thx
10:39  beasty: torbjorn: take a look at this ... http://code.google.com/p/js-hotkeys/
10:39  torbjorn: hm ctrl+s doesnt doesnt do anything on any web page in my IE..
10:39  torbjorn: shouldtn it display a save dialog?
10:41  beasty: normaly yes
10:42  beasty: hmm
10:42  beasty: it seems ctrl+s is disabled in ie8
10:42  torbjorn: http://pastebin.com/MLGRuZRm
10:45  beasty: torbjorn: did you try to do a alert
10:45  beasty: to see if it's called ?
10:46  torbjorn: yeah, nothing happens
10:46  torbjorn: I only got an alert with ctrl-g which I guess is because that isnt already a shortcut in ie
10:47  torbjorn: if( ev.ctrlKey ) alert( ev.which )
10:50  wild_oscar: hi. I'm having difficulties with nextUntil, perhaps someone else more experienced might know the best selector for this:

10:52  Back2Basics: when dealing with the form wizard plugin why don't some of the <span's> disappear when pressing the back or next buttons?  (the new span just appends the new form elements to the other span)
10:54  ispirto: is document.ready waits for images to load, too?
10:55  Cork: no
10:55  Cork: it waits for the dom to be constructed
10:55  Cork: if you want to wait for all images its .load
10:56  Back2Basics: nvm I was using an older version.  I need to try it with 3.0 rather than 2.x
10:56  Cork: (well except for in ie, where it will be .load even if you use .ready)
10:56  ispirto: Cork, hmm, trying to build a page loader like gmail

11:03  iszak: on windows at home - stable as hell

11:05  iszak: even worse.
11:05  Cork: wierd
11:05  iszak: only 1 add-on too
11:05  Cork: heh addons in chrome isn't really capable to causing problems :)
11:05  Cork: they don't have enough privs
11:06  iszak: they can throw things into the page that could break GC tho
11:09  bravo_kernel: hi guys, I have a threaded comments list (UL) in which I am loading a reply-form. Sometimes the list is not re-rerended in IE. Is there a way to force this?

11:31  JKarsrud: asfahaan: need some more info than that
11:31  asfahaan: when the slider elements finish it rewinds back to start. how do i stop it from doing that? I want it to show the first slide on the right with same transition and remove the rewinding effect.
11:31  JKarsrud: nvm
11:31  asfahaan: JKarsrud was typing the extras
11:31  JKarsrud: yeah, I saw :)
11:31  asfahaan: np
11:31  JKarsrud: which plugin are you using?
11:32  mekwall: timing: :parent:has(selector) ?
11:32  asfahaan: hmm i used a script wich was avaialbe online
11:32  asfahaan: let me find the site
11:32  krz: ive got text 'foobar'. i want to check if this text is longer than 3 chars and if so, append '...'
11:33  krz: whats the best way to do this?
11:33  krz: so it should basically display foo...
11:33  RandomSo1t: so not append, but substitute?
11:33  JKarsrud: String.length ?
11:33  mekwall: timing: i.e. $(child).parent().is(selector) or $(child).parent().has(selector) should work as well
11:33  krz: RandomSo1t: yea
11:33  asfahaan: it was based on this Jkarsud and mekwall

11:51  mekwall: .is is the fastest ;)
11:52  timing: mekwall: and closest?
11:52  mekwall: timing: about 20% slower
11:52  timing: ah it's there
11:52  mekwall: yeah
11:53  mekwall: closests is faster then parents because it stops descending the tree when it finds the first parent with the selector
11:53  asfahaan: JKarsrud I am implementing the slider u suggested. would u know if i can add caption for each images with links ?
11:53  mekwall: timing: .parents will continue to traverse the tree to look for more parents with that selector ;)
11:53  mekwall: until it reaches the document root
11:54  timing: and with :first?
11:54  mekwall: timing: doesn't matter since it's just a part of the selector
11:55  mekwall: timing: .parents will still go on and check if any of the ancestors match it :)
11:55  timing: hmm true
11:55  mekwall: timing: even if only one of them match... that's what closest is for :)
11:56  gym_jane: hi guys
11:56  gym_jane: i need some assistance
11:56  mekwall: timing: but since you just want to check if it's a descendant, then .is is best, because it won't traverse the tree in the same way, and won't return an object either, but just a boolean
11:57  gym_jane: click on image - shows hidden div and the image div disappears
11:57  gym_jane: is that possible?
11:57  crab: sure. add a click() handler to the image which .show()s the hidden div and .hide()s the image.

11:59  crab: var f = obj.func;
11:59  lanmower: ok, now lets say the object has two functions.
12:00  lanmower: they both have the same name, I'd like to grab the one with two vars and the one with one var.
12:00  lanmower: if I just grab the function as obj.func, only the one parameter version gets grabbed.
12:01  edbaffei: hi.. how do i get the val()  of a list in the same class? is that even possible
12:01  Cork: edbaffei: list in the same class?

12:41  alaing: doonie lol
12:42  edbaffei: instead of key: [value, value]
12:42  alaing: is there a way to set a select lists value without having to call its change evetn
12:42  Aamir: alaing, use something like $('select').find('option').attr('selected','selected')         so .find('options') will be a list options u want to select

12:52  stygyan: $("#nav ul").tabs("#panes > div", {effect: 'fade', fadeOutSpeed: 400});
12:52  alaing: stygyan: ask away
12:52  stygyan: which alternatives are there?
12:52  stygyan: to that effect?
12:53  alaing: in what sense effects?
12:53  stygyan: oh
12:54  stygyan: it seems i was looking in the wrong place
12:54  alaing: ???

13:02  iszak: interesting stats though, thanks doonie.
13:03  doonie: :)
13:03  nils_r: Concerning jQuery-Templates: in the API it's described that defining templates via string is sub-optimal due to the need of compiling every time. Yet there's an example that defines a template using $.template("name","<p>some markup</p>"); is this optimal?
13:03  doonie: you need to spam more iszak!
13:03  iszak: I would blates be no. 1 if I was unemployed.
13:03  doonie: hehe
13:03  doonie: that's one way to look at it
13:03  iszak: I kind of miss being unemployed.
13:04  alaing: doonie mind if I slap you about to get my name on the stats
13:05  alaing: fuck i hate mondays

13:07  doonie: iphone 4, no then you may not slap me!
13:07  alaing: me throws a brick on doonie
13:07  doonie: iphone is a master of dropping packets!
13:07 * alaing throws a brick on doonie
13:07  iszak: i don't have an iphone.
13:07  stygyan: now i'm stuck.
13:07  alaing: really
13:07  alaing: I'm just keen on the apps
13:08  alaing: and trying out jquery mobile
13:08  stygyan: whenever i put a div inside the panes, it disappears. not showing up.
13:08  doonie: apps smaps, android has it all, and its unlocked. you actually own the phone you buy!
13:08  alaing: stygyan: post of code.
13:08  alaing: doonie I will own my phone with a lil jailbreaking
13:09  JKarsrud: stygyan: using jquery tools tabs?

13:10  alaing: doonie, have u used an iphone?
13:10  stygyan: yay, right now it's only the first one that has got the divs.
13:10  doonie: I have sir
13:10  doonie: and cracked the shit out of it
13:11  doonie: 16h asted to be able to 'use' the US bought phone
13:11  doonie: not stooolen, bouuught
13:11  JKarsrud: stygyan: Shouldn't it be class="pane" not panes?
13:11  stygyan: i need to make a scrollable inside every pane
13:11  alaing: doonie, really....throwing it at a wall when it drops packets does not count...
13:11  doonie: hehe
13:11  doonie: no I was just ponting fingers at the grip of death crap talk ;D
13:11  stygyan: JKarsrud, it doesn't matter - I'm targeting div.panes
13:12  JKarsrud: okay
13:12  stygyan: I maybe thought it was targeting the divs inside those ones too, so I tried to narrow it a little
13:12  stygyan: though obviously, that's not the problem

13:33  Zelest_: nvm
13:33  Zelest_: serializeArray() :D
13:33  JKarsrud: serialize would work too, but jquery does that behind the scenes anyway

13:45  Gurpartap: ?
13:48  alaing: say i had $('.somethingcool').data('testing',1) how do i check if .something has test data
13:49  Northwoods: hi Gurpartap
13:51  Northwoods: $('input[data=abc] ') alaing something like that , can you jsfiddle your code ?
13:51  Aamir: Northwoods,  try   if >  $('.somethingcool').data('events').testing
13:51  Northwoods: thankyou Aamir
13:52  Northwoods: alaing: ^
13:53  Aamir: Northwoods,  sorry i was wrong
13:54  Aamir: Northwoods,  it would be   if(  $('.somethingcool').data('testing') ) { //true  }
13:55  alaing: Northwoods its just a simple $('#myDiv').data('originalValue', 3); what I want to test is is #myDiv has originalValue
13:55  alaing: Aamir: Thanks I'll try that

14:12  alaing: can i have a json object inside .data?
14:13  alaing: how can i add/search for the a value in the json object
14:13  Cork: you can have anything inside .data
14:13  Cork: element references, json, jquery anything you can assign to a variable
14:13  doonie: pr0n
14:14  doonie: oh and smurf!
14:14  Cork: alaing: if you add it as an attribute is another matter
14:14 * doonie eats all his smurfs
14:14  JAAulde: doonie: $( '#screen' ).data( 'pr0n', '8=====D~~~~' );
14:14  doonie: thats gay pr0n ;p
14:14  JAAulde: i figured it was right up your alley
14:14  alaing: what I have is a huge table with custom attributes and a function that builds a select list from the tables data. Now to try and improve performance I want to cache some of the results to reuse should the conditions apply
14:15  JAAulde: :P
14:15  doonie: sry, pick another boyfriend ;p
14:15  doonie: this ass is taken *snap*
14:15  Cork: alaing: if the .data comes from data- attributes it will all be text
14:15  Cork: alaing: and you would have to parse your json
14:15  Kev_: are there any jQuery forum admins kicking about?
14:16  Northwoods: Gurpartap: veere kithon ?
14:17  doonie: jq has a forum?!
14:17 * doonie goes and spams ham
14:17  alaing: Cork I was hoping to have $('#myDiv').data('ExistingSelects', [{a: 'select list html'}])
14:17  Kev_: doonie: http://forum.jquery.com/
14:17  sean`: lol
14:18  sean`: sweet and naieve doonsie
14:18  Cork: alaing: that will work (and i do it my self)
14:18  alaing: Cork: then somehow check it ExistingSelects "a" i
14:18  alaing: ignore that
14:18 * doonie slaps sean` to sense,we're gonna die!
14:18  Cork: alaing: what won't work is <td> data-ExistingSelects=" [{a: 'select list html'}]">
14:18  soee: hmm strange thing, any idea why function is called twice when i hover my button ?
14:18  doonie: we zijn goig om te sterven!
14:18  Cork: alaing: *what won't work is <td data-ExistingSelects=" [{a: 'select list html'}]">
14:18  sean`: Cork, why not?
14:18  Cork: sean`: cause then it will be text, and would need to be parsed
14:19  alaing: Cork: How would I add to that JSON
14:19  Cork: alaing: the line your adding will work just find (as js objects/json)
14:19  alaing: say I want to ad b:'some other select list html'
14:20  Cork: its when its added inline in the html it doens't work
14:20  Cork: alaing: $(this).data('parent', $(this).parent()); works
14:20  Clorith: I'm havin gsome selector issues, I'm not 100% sure what the problem with them is, but I JSFiddles it at http://jsfiddle.net/9a9j7/ if someone could help me have a look.
14:20  Cork: alaing: so as long as you add it with .data('name', value) you can add anything
14:21  Clorith: The general idea is that when I hit "Add", it'll grabt the current values of that one line, in a couple variables (printed in console.log), and add a new identical line under it
14:21 --- sean`` is now known as sean`
14:21  alaing: no how do I add more values to the JSON after its been created
14:21  sean`: Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/5vKBE/
14:21  alaing: i know $(this).data('existing') would return the json object
14:22  Cork: alaing: $('#myDiv').data('ExistingSelects').b =
14:22 --- sean` is now known as Guest45060
14:22  alaing: so if i wanted to add "b" I would just have .b="some more html"
14:22  Guest45060: ?extend @ alaing
14:22  bot-t: alaing, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
14:23  Cork: sean`: thsi is what we talk about http://jsfiddle.net/5vKBE/1/
14:23  Cork: alaing: yes, .data only holds a reference to the object, so you can add things to it with out a problem
14:23  alaing: and to find it?
14:23  Cork: thats what i showed you
14:24  Cork: alaing: $('#myDiv').data('ExistingSelects') will give you the object
14:24  Cork: its the same as var ExistingSelects = [{a: 'select list html'}];
14:24  Cork: ExistingSelects.b = ''
14:24  alaing: do you think I would get better performance having one .data and storing a json object with all the extra data or create separate .data
14:25 --- Guest45060 is now known as sean`
14:25  Cork: depends on how you use it
14:25  alaing: like .data('existingselecta','some text').data('existingselectb','some more text')
14:25  Cork: .data is only meaningfull if you need to assosiate it
14:25  Cork: alaing: mostly its not needed, but its up to you
14:25  Cork: both work
14:25  sean`: Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/5vKBE/2/
14:26  sean`: need to traverse properly dude
14:26  alaing: ok i know $(this).data('ExistingSelect') would return the json object but how would I find a key and its value ?
14:27  Cork: sean`: interesting, last i checked i only got text from those attributes
14:27  sean`: yeah
14:27  sean`: valid JSON will render an object
14:27  sean`: or wateffs
14:27  Cork: alaing: you would have to loop the object if you don't know its name
14:28  doonie: hmm weird usage of jq isn't it? $(document.createElement("div")).attr
14:28  Cork: uh... why?
14:28  doonie: would like $('<div>') suffice?
14:28  Cork: $('<div/>')
14:28  alaing: and if i know its name then would be something like $(this).data('ExistingSelect').b would return b value right?
14:28  doonie: yea that
14:29  Cork: ?eval $('<div/>')[0].typeName
14:29  bot-t: Cork: undefined
14:29  Cork: ?eval $('<div/>')[0].tagName
14:29  bot-t: Cork: undefined
14:29  Cork: grrr
14:29  doonie: now if I want an img in that div and alter its attr, what do I do mr corkie
14:30  Cork: var $img = $('<img/>'); $img.attr...; $('<div/>').append($img);
14:31  doonie: yay *claps hands*
14:31  doonie: turns out i don't need a div ;D
14:32 * doonie is hacking together a snow js ;\
14:32  sean`: doonie, <div> is more than enough
14:32  alaing: and if i know its name then would be something like $(this).data('ExistingSelect').b would return b value right?
14:32  doonie: sean` got new date yet broooooo?
14:32  alaing: or do I have to pasrseJSON
14:33  Cork: alaing: in your example your wrapping it all in an array so [0].b
14:33  sean`: doonie, nah, waitings
14:33  Dr4g: hai sean` ;)

15:00  SugaSlide: doonie you fail!!!!
15:00  SugaSlide: ruby_on_tails yes
15:00  doonie: u sux sugga bugga
15:00  ruby_on_tails: SugaSlide: Clorith: why i ask is if i put an alert inside the callback function of the ajax call that alert never takes place, any alert before the ajax request or after it works
15:00  SugaSlide: error in the ajax?
15:00  muhdik: hi
15:01  jomofcw: So, no idea how to set a "style" for a ui.button element ?
15:01  Clorith: jomofcw: css is my final answer :P
15:01  ruby_on_tails: SugaSlide: no firebug shows the mysql error returned
15:01  SugaSlide: ruby_on_tails might be that its not detecting that the ajax has finished...
15:01  SugaSlide: hmm then try
15:01  jomofcw: Clorith yea that's how I do it actually :/ But it should be better to add it in button "constructor" as an option.
15:01  SugaSlide: error: function(){
15:01  aro: is it possible to have one 'live' event prevent antoher live event from firing?
15:01  SugaSlide: inside your ajax
15:02  doonie: Clorith tried it with a simple click but fails, could be my browser, as it feels like it's crashing, but I gtg in 2min so can't help 2day ;\ srrryyyy
15:02  Clorith: darn, oh well
15:02  Clorith: thanks any way =)
15:02  SugaSlide: nuuuuuuuuuuuuu
15:02  ablomen: aro, if it returns false, yes
15:02  SugaSlide: doonie dont go :(
15:02  aro: for some reason they are both firing
15:02  Clorith: it's ok SugaSlide, the two of us can enjoy my issues meanwhile :P
15:02  aro: even though i have the first live event returning false
15:03  doonie: baiiiiiiiiiii
15:04  SugaSlide: im changing alot of my .live functions to plugins at the mo
15:04  SugaSlide: easier lol
15:05  ablomen: aro, well i am not sure if you can depend on the one that is bound first to actually run first, should check the source sometime how that is handled
15:05  aro: i have $('form').live('submit' .... ) and after that function i have $('form#TicketAddForm').live('submit' .... )
15:06  aro: the second one is firing even though the first returns falst
15:06  aro: false*
15:06  ruby_on_tails: SugaSlide: If a request with jQuery.post() returns an error code, it will fail silently unless the script has also called the global .ajaxError()  method.
15:06  ruby_on_tails: how to turn that .ajaxError method on ?
15:06  aro: ruby_on_tails: it is on by default
15:06  aro: it is a listener
15:07  SugaSlide: try using $.ajax instead
15:07  ruby_on_tails: what to do that the post request failes non-silently ?
15:07  aro: just create a $.ajaxError function
15:07  ruby_on_tails: aro: any example ?
15:07  ruby_on_tails: i am bad with js syntax
15:07  ablomen: aro, well i guess you either can't depend on that first function to fire first or there is an error somewhere
15:07  jomofcw: The answer should be part of that > http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/API there's priority thing about button. But how to set a button to the primary or secondary priority please ?

15:24  sean``: var obj = {}; obj[l_name] = l_value;
15:24  blackspotwiggins: alaing, you cant use variables in that notation
15:24  sean``: $('#myElement').data('existingSelects', obj);
15:25  alaing: So I have to build the json before I set existingSelects?
15:25  ruby_on_tails: ok i am using this code : http://pastebin.com/T3eGDSF4 and i dont get the delete failed alerted but if i use $.ajax with same parameters i get the alert, why ?
15:25  jomofcw: sean`` I just try it : icon don't add css class to the button element, but to the span element inside the button one which will represent the icon element...
15:25  aro: sean``: http://jsfiddle.net/BHGuZ/
15:26  sean``: jomofcw, yeah, what do you want to d o?
15:26  sean``: add a class to the button, jomofcw >?
15:26  jomofcw: sean`` yep.
15:26  sean``: aro, that can be alot more simpler
15:26  ruby_on_tails: the mysql error is outputted as a php echo only so it should mean a string returned to the post call also ?
15:26  Clorith: YES, PROGRESS!
15:26  ruby_on_tails: but it works if i make it .ajax. where as the .post needs the error handler
15:27  Clorith: the problem was me grabbing .html, and it then searched the default values stored in the HTML, not the user values
15:27  aro: okay
15:27  alaing: So I have to build the json before I set existingSelects?
15:27  sean``: aro, as I said, events fire in chronological order
15:27  sean``: so, the one above fires first, making it impossible to cancle it uot from the event below.. as it's fired after
15:28  ruby_on_tails: oh nvm
15:28  aro: well the event below doesnt cancel the above one
15:28  aro: the one above is supposed to cancel the one below
15:28  sean``: oke

15:30  jomofcw: sean`` it seems to exist (other than the icon system), but can't find how to set it. http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming/API and search for the key word "ui-priority-primary".

15:30  halcyon1234: .... ok, all things.
15:31  jomofcw: I could add this manually, but I ask myself if it exist something to add it using constructor

17:10  alaing: please can some one help me with my json issue . after escaping " within the string I get [{"something":"<option value="cool">Cool</option"}] which is not a valid string to start with here is code  http://pastebin.com/ieywxyMd
17:10  alaing: I need to escape it for a second time but not sure how too
17:10  temp01: um wtf
17:10  DragoneneWork2: if I get the response "error" on an ajax request, what's going wrong?
17:11  DragoneneWork2: it's not a parsererror, cleaerly
17:11  temp01: you write json by hand then parse it using parseJSON??
17:11  DragoneneWork2: so what might be causing it?
17:11  alaing: temp was that for me?
17:11  temp01: yes
17:11  pintofeggs: Hi
17:11  temp01: you shouldn't be doing that string concatanation and parsing at all
17:12  temp01: you should be modifying/working on an object directly
17:12  pintofeggs: I have a number of paragraphs that i want to display in sequence in a container. When i try this, it always replaceses it with the last paragraph. And prefoms the animation on that one.
17:12  alaing: ok so how can i improve that code
17:12  alaing: the object needs to be dynamic
17:12  temp01: ?p @ pintofeggs
17:12  bot-t: pintofeggs, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
17:13  temp01: alaing: obj = {}; obj[name] = value;
17:13  DragoneneWork2: any ideas at all? :/ I ran the server-side code without ajax, seems to work fine (though it has a few less parameters that I don't control manually, they're generated from within DataTables).
17:13  alaing: ok and then I do not have to parse it
17:14  DragoneneWork2: it also works fine with an apache/mysql setup
17:14  DragoneneWork2: just doesn't work on iis/mssql
17:18  pintofeggs: bot-t: http://jsfiddle.net/vFtkc/1/

17:21  temp01: http://jsfiddle.net/temp01/vFtkc/2/
17:24  alaing: temp01: thanks that worked perfectly am I right in thinking I would use .push to add another value to obj=[]

17:26  jdingman: does anyone know of a plugin or way to do a client-side captcha?  the only ones I've seen all have some sort of server-side component, even if it's a simple captcha
17:27  pintofeggs: how would i then get that to loop indefinatly
17:27  pintofeggs: ?
17:29  Cork[home]: jdingman: it would need to be a farly complex thing to do in js
17:29  jdingman: Cork[home]: I would imagine so, yes.  do you know of anything that exists?
17:29  Cork[home]: jdingman: the only way i can think of is with the help of canvas
17:30  Cork[home]: jdingman: you would have to have a way to verify it serverside, else it would be farly pointless
17:30  serio: has anibody else noticed this horrid issue with animating fonts in IE7?
17:30  serio: I guess it has something to do with the ditherings/anti-aliasing of fonts?
17:30  serio: god it looks awful.
17:30  sean``: yeah
17:30  sean``: there's afix
17:31  jdingman: Cork[home]: argh.  trying to avoid serverside, because I'm posting to an external source and trying to avoid having a middle page, I can't pass the data through a PHP post effectively.  that's the reason for wanting to avoid the middle page and doing it client-side
17:31  Cork[home]: serio: much when it comes to animation looks horrid in ie
17:31  serio: sean``, do you know what it is off hand?
17:31  sean``: remove the filter style
17:31 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:32  Cork[home]: jdingman: the reason it would need to be server side, is that otherwize it could just be ignored by the bot, all it would need is the url
17:32  Cork[home]: jdingman: but whats the problem with proxying it through another server?
17:32  jdingman: Cork[home]: proxying...how?
17:33  Cork[home]: jdingman: post to your own script, and let it send it forward through ex, curl
17:33  jdingman: curl would have to use a GET though, not a POST, right?
17:33  Cork[home]: jdingman: or even better if you want speed; have a small database and a cron script that post it over to the server
17:33  Cork[home]: no
17:33  Cork[home]: curl can handle any formats
17:34  Cork[home]: post/get/delete/put and so on
17:34  jdingman: oh, that might work then.  thx for the tip, I'll do some research around that
17:34  Cork[home]: ?g php curl

17:34  jdingman: thx!
17:37  serio: can you add multiple callbacks to animate?
17:38  keystr0k: Can someone please point me in the right direction? Which jQuery methods should I use to achieve this: http://public.agileadam.com/images/jquery_question-20101206-113707.jpg
17:38  keystr0k: Or in general, what do I want to do?
17:39  dilvie: keyst0k: I don't understand the question.
17:39  dilvie: Which element do you want to change, and where is the data coming from?
17:39  keystr0k: dilvie:  thanks for looking... I need to turn the <h2> into a link that has the same href path as the first li element
17:40  Cork[home]: keystr0k: $(this).next().find('li')
17:40  Cork[home]: keystr0k: that is $('h2').click(function() { $(this).next().find('li') });
17:41  keystr0k: Cork[home]: and do I need to set that li's href property to a variable to use for my new <a> tag... ? Or can I do all of this with a wo
17:41  keystr0k: ohhhh.
17:41  keystr0k: I figured I'd wrap the header with <a> </a>, but maybe what you're saying is better...
17:41  keystr0k: Cork[home]: ^
17:42  keystr0k: Though, I guess I'd like the cursor to be a pointer (hand)... though I could do that with CSS.
17:42  dilvie: Cork: that code won't actually do anything. You've selected the li element, but the click isn't going to take you to the address. =)
17:42  Cork[home]: ok ok...
17:42  keystr0k: dilvie:  yeah, he's just getting me started :)
17:42  dilvie: =)
17:42  Cork[home]: keystr0k: that is $('h2').click(function() { $(this).next().find('li a').click(); });
17:42  Cork[home]: there
17:43  Cork[home]: hmm, but that won't work
17:43  keystr0k: hehe
17:43  inckie: http://pastebin.ca/2012066 what's wrong with this? i don't get any data, and the GET request turns red i Firebug, but with a 200 OK. (port 80 on the server is blocked by a whistlist, so you can't check the URL)
17:43  lukas: http://pastebin.com/4tkyP3RL < whats wrong with tempate plugin?
17:45  Cork[home]: keystr0k: you would actually have to do something like this  $('h2').each(function() { var href = $(this).next().find('li a').attr('href'); $(this).html($('<a/>').html($(this).html()).attr('href', href)); });
17:45  keystr0k: holy cow. haha.
17:45  Cork[home]: keystr0k: else it won't be a working click event
17:45  Cork[home]: you can't fake a link clicks
17:45  keystr0k: Cork[home]: I'll try to figure out what you've done.
17:45  keystr0k: :)
17:46  keystr0k: I figured it'd be easier to add an <a> tag???
17:46  Cork[home]: thats what i'm doing :)
17:46  keystr0k: oh, that's what you're doing
17:46  keystr0k: haha
17:46  keystr0k: just realized that!
17:46  keystr0k: :)
17:46  keystr0k: Cork[home]: that works perfectly.
17:47  keystr0k: Cork[home]: I'll just target the header a little more specifically. thanks mate!
17:47  Cork[home]: np
17:47  keystr0k: Cork[home]: the other thing is, it'll only ever be one element... so can I do it without the 'each' ? I'll look into it. THanks again!
17:48  Cork[home]: keystr0k: sure you can
17:48  keystr0k: :) almost got it
17:48  Cork[home]: keystr0k: select your header, and replace all the $(this) element with your variable
17:48  Cork[home]: and skip the each loop
17:48  keystr0k: perfect.
17:48  keystr0k: thx
17:49  keystr0k: jquery is amazing :)   I'm on page 78 of jQuery Novice to Ninja. wahooo
17:50  dilvie: Cork: that code is not very efficient... especially if there are lots of h2 tags on the page..
17:50  Cork[home]: dilvie: its not that bad
17:50  SmokeyD: hey everyone, is there a widget or something that let's me show a html element and automatically truncate the text that it contains to a specified length and show a "more" link that, when clicked, shows the full text? I can do it myself, but I don't want to re-invent the wheel
17:51  Cork[home]: dilvie: its actaully only a dom sibling step and a find event
17:51  keystr0k: dilvie: have something better ? hehe. a little friendly competition...
17:51  dilvie: you're doing the $(this) lookup three times per h2. =)
17:51  Snerf: is there a way to split a string, but have it split only say to a maximum number of items?
17:51  Cork[home]: dilvie: no not a lookup, but wrapping
17:51  dilvie: var $this = $(this)
17:52  Cork[home]: ?mdc string split
17:52  bot-t: Cork[home], split - Splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
17:52  Cork[home]: Snerf: ^
17:53  dilvie: $(this) is a DOM element lookup (which is slow)
17:53  Cork[home]: dilvie: no its not
17:53  Snerf: thanks
17:53  Cork[home]: dilvie: it takes a dom element and wraps it in jquery
17:53  Cork[home]: dilvie: no dom lookup is needed
17:54  Cork[home]: this is the dom element
17:54  dilvie: Cork: every time you do $(this), it iterates through the dom to find the element to wrap in jQuery
17:54  Cork[home]: NO
17:54  keystr0k: oh jeez. sorry
17:54  Cork[home]: it create a new jquery elemtn, it doens't make a lookup
17:54  Cork[home]: its no need to, as it already have the dom element
17:55  Cork[home]: sure, it is a speed gain to not create the object over and over again
17:55  atan: How do I delete the parent TR of the #delete clicked? $("a#delete").click(function() { $('#lineItems tr:last').remove();	}); is what I have currently
17:55  atan: Which of course removes the last row... not exactly what I need =\ close though!
17:55  dilvie: $(this).next().find('li a').attr('href'); <-- so it magically pulls that href out of it's ass. That's not a DOM lookup? =)
17:55  Cork[home]: dilvie: but its not as bad as ex. $('body div span .classname')
17:55 --- xjamundx is now known as jamund
17:56  Cork[home]: dilvie: $(this) thats the this element and wraps it in all the jquery magic functions
17:56  carlosleon: atan: $( 'a#delete' ).click( function(){ $( this ).parents( 'tr' ).remove() } );
17:56  atan: <3 you
17:56  Cork[home]: then YES .next() and .find does dom travel
17:56  Cork[home]: but $(this) doesn't
17:56  carlosleon: atan: :$ hahaha
17:57  carlosleon: atan: did it work? :P
17:57  atan: Flawlessly.
17:57  dilvie: Cork: so you're saying that jQuery does caching for $(this) internally? =)
17:57  atan: carbocation, you are symbolic of awesomeness. Seriously. Thanks!
17:57  Cork[home]: dilvie: whats there to cache?
17:58  Cork[home]: dilvie: have you even checked what this is?
17:58  Cork[home]: its a point to a dom node
17:58  Cork[home]: jquery doesn't have to find the dom node when its given the dom node
17:58  dilvie: hm
17:58  Cork[home]: the only overhed you get when you do $(this) is the creation of the jquery object
17:59  dilvie: I see.
17:59  Cork[home]: but yes thats an overhead, but far from as big as a dom lookup
17:59  dilvie: that's true.
17:59  carlosleon: atan: I guess you wanted to thank... me? :P
17:59  atan: Err, sorry, yes
18:00  carlosleon: nobody ever before have told me "you are symbolic of awesomeness. Seriously. Thanks!" :'(
18:00  dilvie: on a very large page, you'd still feel the difference between caching $this and doing the $(this) wrap every time. =)
18:00  atan: carbocation, go suck a lemon. carlosleonm thank you graciously!
18:00  carlosleon: LOL
18:00  Cork[home]: dilvie: no, but if you do it man times in each loop you will
18:01  Cork[home]: dilvie: the size of the page doesn't matter, but ex. if you in the each loop has another loop where you modify things, and each iteration uses $(this)
18:01  Cork[home]: then you can mesure the difference
18:01  Cork[home]: so only the number of times you call $(this) matter
18:02  Cork[home]: here its an overhead of 2 objects
18:02  Cork[home]: and thats not even detectable
18:02 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
18:02  dilvie: Cork: the size of the page effects it because you'll add an iteration to the outer loop for every h2 on the page.
18:02 --- JKarsrud1 is now known as JKarsrud_
18:03  Cork[home]: dilvie: but you have to do $(this) at least once in each loop
18:03  dilvie: of course.
18:03  Cork[home]: dilvie: not until you end up calling the $(this) hundreds of times is it even mesurable
18:04  atan: Any ideas why I can't run this? http://pastie.org/private/xgcz9t9qnkxsf2l4t2xlg
18:04  Cork[home]: (hundreds of times extra)
18:04  atan: Is it expecting one only line?
18:05  Cork[home]: atan: you can't have line breaks in strings
18:05  dilvie: Cork: I'm aware. I'm just being a nit-picky jerk. =)
18:05  atan: Cork, well then... =)
18:05  atan: thanks!
18:05  dilvie: Thanks for the education about how $(this) behaves in a .each loop, though. =)
18:05  Cork[home]: dilvie: it actually behaves in that way wevery time you give it a dom node
18:06  Cork[home]: ex. var target = document.getElementById('elm'); $(target)
18:06  Cork[home]: *every

19:00  SkyFlyer: I have 4 date picker input boxes on a page.  I'm trying to get the onClose menthod to work.  When you click on the input field, the data box pops up, but you can't close it. Once it closes I need to get a value from what ever input box was clicked on for the date? Not sure how to get the value back from that input onClose for the date picker since there are multiple ones per page? anyone?

19:00  WebDragon: hey question about the jQuery hoverIntent plugin .. I've got it set up on the dropdown for http://phantom:review@phantomlab.us/home.php  but for some reason, the first time you hover the menu the hoverIntent doesn't fire
19:00  bot-t: (69 hours 40 mins ago) <eTiger13> tell WebDragon what does "how's life treating me? ...like a fridge magnet poem )" mean?
19:00  zhrance: adoven, thanks
19:01  WebDragon: just curious about what I might have been doing wrong in setting it up
19:01  delinquentme: Cork, those two ids correspond to <input> s
19:01  WebDragon: ROFL I forgot I had that as a part message
19:02  delinquentme: and the mouseover events arent firing when the mouse enter the area of the input .. so i was wondering if i've somehow coded something incorrectly
19:02 --- _iain is now known as Backie
19:02  Cork[home]: delinquentme: ok?
19:02  delinquentme: its a fairly complex app .. so im wondering if its a problem of scope .. and not in jquery
19:02  adoven: zhrance: np
19:02  Cork[home]: delinquentme: have you checked so its actually selects the desired elements?
19:02  ajpiano: delinquentme. you should use mouseenter and mouseleave...not...mouseover and mouseleave
19:03  ajpiano: delinquentme, also you sholud select those elements directly, doing $("#id").children("#anotherid") is pointless
19:03  delinquentme: ajpiano, yeah i had mouseenter earlier .. wasnt working either ... and Cork yeah i've checked in firebugs console
19:04  delinquentme: ajpiano, AH! noted.
19:04  WebDragon: the hoverIntent fires off every subsequent time AFTER the first time, but somehow not the first time
19:05  delinquentme: cleaner code .. always good .  however .. still no adding of the "active" class on the <input> elements
19:06  Toodles: Hi everybody. Looking for suggestions on where to find a jquery text animation effect to help display short quotations / testimonial excerpts.
19:06  ajpiano: delinquentme, can you make a demo on jsfiddle that illustrates this bug hapening
19:06  zhrance: adoven do you have any clue how this bug can happen?
19:07  zhrance: has to do with the animation part I guess?

19:13  ajpiano: wtf
19:14  ajpiano: you have to include...JQUERY
19:14  ajpiano: see the "Choose Framework" part
19:15  delinquentme: ok .. and both text boxes are checked .. then update clicked
19:15  ajpiano: delinquentme, this works just fine http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/mfAFd/2/
19:15  Toodles: Sorry, wasn't clear before ... looking for suggestions where to find a SPECIFIC text animation effect. Sort of a fade-in / fade-out but more like a fog-in (unfocused grey blur becomes sharp white text) / fog-out (sharp white text zooms and disperses into faded grey) ... any suggestions ?
19:15  adoven: zhrance: i haven't actually looked into it, but i've been working on the accordion stuff so i'll get to it in a couple of weeks
19:15  Toodles: I know I have seen it but can't find it.
19:15  devinrolsen: morning

19:39  asfahaan: Trying to get the caption to look like this: http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/nz.html
19:40  Ryro: did you want the caption to show up on hover or just a constant overlay?
19:42  asfahaan: constanly overlay
19:42  stygyan: ajpiano, you were right. the problem was not in IE, but in the mind of the client.
19:42  stygyan: he just sucks at explaining.
19:42  ajpiano: yeah, that happens a lot
19:42  asfahaan: like on this site: http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/nz.html
19:43  stygyan: ajpiano, he sent me a screenshot of the transition between tabs, telling me it looked like that.
19:43  stygyan: without talking about transition in any moment.
19:43  Ryro: asfahaan: right, you need to make a div after the slideshow div and give it the following css rules
19:43  ajpiano: clients are super helpful
19:43  Ryro: color: black;     display: block;     height: 30px;     position: relative;     top: -30px;     width: 100%;     z-index: 2;
19:44  serio: #css
19:44  Ryro: z-index should be some high number
19:44  Ryro: higher than 2 rather than what i just said
19:44  Ryro: and serio is correct this isnt a jquery question :)
19:44  asfahaan: in the demo for the script they didnt have a href for the images
19:45  Ryro: asfahaan: please explain what you mean by that?
19:46  asfahaan: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/caption.html the images on this slideshow dont have hyperlinks
19:46  asfahaan: correct

19:57  Ryro: there should never be something with the same id
19:57  Ryro: its not valid if you re-use id's
19:57  JuJuBee: I already serialized the form for ajax
19:57  JuJuBee: Ok, so should I use different id and same names then?
19:57  Ryro: yes
19:57  trend: no
19:57  peeps[lappy]: stygyan, your radio buttons should have the same name, but not id
19:57  trend: ids need to equal name
19:57  wenbert: test
19:58  trend: use another node attribute
19:58  trend: like rel
19:58  chovy: greetings
19:58  JuJuBee: don't radios usually have same name though?
19:58  trend: or a className.. or form.find("input") as the selector
19:58  Ryro: yes radios should have same name
19:58  trend: oh, sorry .. yeah
19:59  JuJuBee: so id doesn't = name?
19:59  Ryro: correct
19:59  JuJuBee: doesnt have to that is.
19:59  Ryro: id is different than name
19:59  trend: it usually should
19:59  asfahaan: Ryro how do i now move the caption to be above the image? and to wrap around ? should i place it inside a <p> the caption ?
19:59  trend: name is used for POSTing.. ID is used for DOM selectors
20:00  Ryro: asfahaan: you can use a css rule with relative positioning and then position it
20:00  JuJuBee: Ryro ok, then once I click submit and catch that how do I get the value of the input with name class_id? since they are radios only one gets sent
20:00  trend: so logically, you should keep them the same for your mental health :)
20:00  asfahaan: http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/nz.html this is my desired output. but this script was too heavy. so someone in this chat room suggested to use the cycle script instead
20:01  Ryro: jujubee: what are you trying to do? send all values of radios even if they arent selected?
20:02  b1lly: if you have a bunch of elements indexed like class="id_1",class="id_2".... is there a way to do a $('.id_*').click

20:43  whalesalad: So I've got this menu all worked out. I'd like the menu to hide when a user clicks anything else on the page. I'm not sure the best approach for this... http://grab.by/7KVA
20:43  lithi: lol
20:43  lithi: @the VIRB advert
20:43  Yarizard: whalesalad, could insert an overlay element, put click handler on that to close the menu
20:44  lithi: It STILL takes weeks to build one
20:45  whalesalad: Yarizard: I was thinking of that... but then if I click on something it won't actually do anything, because that click will be on the overlay element
20:45  whalesalad: Yarizard: Ideally clicking on anything else will follow-thru as well
20:56  JuJuBee: Ryro: I got the script working, now having trouble finding an error related to ajax.  My php script is http://pastie.org/1353198  but if I uncomment line 16, my js fires the ajax error.
20:56  JuJuBee: Any ideas?
20:57  Ryro: jujubee: what is the remove_course function on line 16 doing?
20:57  Ryro: jujubee: that's not trying to call a javascript function is it?
20:58  JuJuBee: It takes care of removing a course from db and filesystem clean up if necessary.  It works, I know because itt has been in use for a year now.
20:58  JuJuBee: No, it is a php function in functionLib.php as included above
20:59 --- Gercek_ is now known as Gercek
20:59  JuJuBee: When I uncomment it, my ajax error fires and I get undefined as the error...
21:00  JuJuBee: Ryro: here is the js http://pastie.org/1353218
21:01  Ryro: i bet response.error is a string, try testing for if(response.error == 'false'){
21:01  Ryro: or are you getting an ajax error?
21:02  JuJuBee: Im getting undefind for response.message under the ajax error section
21:02  JuJuBee: If I comment out line 16, everyting works fine (minus the actual delete course)
21:03  JuJuBee: I even tested returning true for error from the script
21:03  JuJuBee: Just to make sure the error: would fire back in js
21:03  Ryro: does remove_course echo out anything?
21:03  JuJuBee: No
21:03  Ryro: what browser are you using?
21:04  JuJuBee: I just disabled the click on the delete button and used old page refresh method and it worked

21:07  JuJuBee: I installed it but don;t really know how to use it.  Let me enable and try it...
21:07  Ryro: because if its expecting json and you are having something get output by accident, it will cause your ajax function to error

21:14  JuJuBee: well, thanks for that.  FireBug seems to be quite useful
21:14  Ryro: extremely useful
21:14  SugaSlide: bot-t: tell hopsy dont hide.... i dont bite
21:14  bot-t: SugaSlide, Okay.
21:15  JuJuBee: I appreciate the help.
21:15  sac: SandmanNet, you'll need 4 overlay divs on the page positioned so that only the specific div is not under them
21:16  sac: SandmanNet, i'm sure there is a premade one somewhere but doesn't take long to develop it yourself
21:16  SandmanNet: sac: Interesting, that would be a neat solution indeed... I was figuring that I should clone the element and show it in the same position over the shade layer
21:16  sac: don't try that, it's gonna give you several different kinds of trouble :)
21:17  SandmanNet: sac: Yeah, I'm sure I'd have to deal with resizing and scrolling as well...
21:17  sac: sometimes it works perfect tho
21:17  SandmanNet: sac: They shouldn't be able to interact with the element while in "presentation" mode... it's meant to be a help mode - "explain this page to me" and iot fades while sequentially showing different areas of the page along with a text...
21:18  Ryro: couldn't you temporarily change positioning to relative and put a div under it?

21:26  coldhead: asfahaan: it won't fix your problem but its a common courtesy
21:26  coldhead: asfahaan: it looks like $ is being overriden
21:26  coldhead: try replacing $ with jQuery where you call cycle
21:27  JKarsrud_: or use a closure, as you should
21:27  asfahaan: hmm where abouts is this ?
21:27  asfahaan: sorry
21:28  coldhead: asfahaan: i'm not sure where it is being overridden, but if you inspect $ at the console you'll see its not jQuery
21:28  coldhead: asfahaan: change every $ in 272-281 to jQuery and it works
21:29  coldhead: or find the $ stealer
21:29  coldhead: JKarsrud_: if you look at the code you'll agree closures are a lesson for another day

21:37  asfahaan: coldhead can you please find out where and what is stealing the $ ?
21:37  asfahaan: i been looking around for more than an hour now
21:37  coldhead: MAYBE IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A LENDER
21:37  asfahaan: i am so confused

21:39  asfahaan: I replaced the $ with jQuery

21:56  WebDragon: anyone here worked much with jquery.hoverIntent ?
21:57  Ryro: webdragon: little bit
21:57  WebDragon: http://phantom:review@phantomlab.us/home.php
21:57  WebDragon: for some reason the dropdown on Products (which I'm trying to talk them into using a Mega-menu for so just ignore the length) isn't firing the hoverIntent the first time you hover and mouseout the menu
21:58  WebDragon: AFTER that the hoverIntent works fine, just not the FIRST time
21:58  WebDragon: any suggestions/clues would be appreciated
21:58  Back2Basics: currently I have this ->  At <input type="text" size="4" value="0">hours <input type="text" size="4" value="2">min <input type="text" size="4" value="3">seconds            does anyone have ideas for a better timer widget?
21:59  WebDragon: same problem in opera/ff/chrome so I'm reasonably certain it's something I either did, or forgot to do, that's causing the problem
21:59  WebDragon: i.e. not a browser specific issue
21:59  SugaSlide: hmm
22:00  Back2Basics: WebDragon: document.ready issue?
22:01  WebDragon: Back2Basics: I ... don't believe so
22:01  WebDragon: how would I test that?
22:01  Ryro: WebDragon: its working for me...?.? or am I crazy...
22:02  jrockjiggs: Back2Basics: yes, timepicker
22:02  WebDragon: Reload the page, and then hover the menu again and notice that it disappears immediately on mouseout, but after that it waits a sec before fading
22:02  jrockjiggs: Back2Basics: it's built ontop of jQuery UI datepicker
22:02  WebDragon: it's only the very first time on a clean refresh that it happens
22:02  Ryro: ahh, on the mouse out.. got it
22:02  WebDragon: yeah, weird ain't it? it obviously is working since it DOES work
22:03  WebDragon: just not the first time xD
22:03  Back2Basics:   $(document).ready(function () {
22:03  Back2Basics:   $("p").text("The DOM is now loaded and can be manipulated.");
22:03  Back2Basics: });
22:03  WebDragon: same thing in all browsers, so I know it's something I overlooked

22:03  Back2Basics: jrockjiggs: ty I'll look it up.

22:09  Bartzy|work: Hi
22:09  Ryro: WebDragon: your out function is getting called the problem what you are doing with it
22:09  Back2Basics: WebDragon: something is set that is removed or later ignored?  something is not there that is later set?
22:09  WebDragon: Ryro: how so?
22:09  Bartzy|work: I need to iterate over a set of DOM elements (inside a function), and return false if even one of the elements iteration function will return false... How can I do it with .each() ?
22:09  WebDragon: it shouldn't be a callback?
22:09  Ryro: add console.log(this) to your out function
22:09  WebDragon: ok
22:10  Bartzy|work: return false inside the each will only return the each() function... and the rest of the elements will continue to iterate
22:10  peter2: temp01: he was connected as chris but i dont know his ip address off hand.  he is registered as keith27
22:10  Ryro: WebDragon: then watch it in firebug console
22:10  WebDragon: Ryro: where should I add it? before, during or after the line there
22:10  Ryro: right after the function call, first thing your function does
22:10  WebDragon: ok
22:11  temp01: peter2: tell your friend to log in to IRC
22:11  Bartzy|work: how can I "break" out of .each() ?
22:11  temp01: return false
22:11  WebDragon: *sn0rt* console not defined. forgot to open firebug first
22:12  WebDragon: oops :)
22:12  Ryro: but you know it gets called then right?
22:12  Bartzy|work: temp01: That will break only from 1 element right ?
22:12  Bartzy|work: I want to break out of all
22:12  WebDragon: Ryro: yeah, just shows up '<li>' :)
22:12  Bartzy|work: set a flag and stop iterating
22:13  temp01: Bartzy|work: why don't you check the docs
22:13  peter2: temp01: he is at work can i text him to pm you later on?
22:13  Ryro: so its not hoverintent that isnt working, its $(this).find(".sub").stop().fadeTo('slow', 0, function () { $(this).hide(); }); that isnt working
22:13  WebDragon: obviously it's a difference in what the css is doing vs what jquery does with show/hide
22:14  Bartzy|work: temp01: It was not clear for me from the docs if return false breaks from the entire loop or only from 1 element
22:17  danheberden: Bartzy|work: which func?
22:17  Bartzy|work: function whatever() { $('div').each(function() {}); }
22:18  danheberden: yeah, return false'll kick outta that
22:18  temp01: peter2: what did you friend do anyway?
22:18  WebDragon: does hide() toggle visibility: hidden?
22:18  WebDragon: or display: none
22:18  Bartzy|work: danheberden: Out of whatever() ?
22:18  Bartzy|work: or only out of the .each() ?
22:18  danheberden: in map,filter it'll not return and continue iteration
22:18  danheberden: just each
22:18  Ryro: ?tias @ WebDragon
22:18  bot-t: WebDragon, Try It And See
22:18  danheberden: well, probably more
22:18  danheberden: but each vs map
22:19  Ryro: ?hide
22:19  bot-t: .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
22:19  Bartzy|work: danheberden: OK, but it will break out of the entire each right ? will not continue iterating ?
22:19  danheberden: correct, Bartzy|work
22:19  Bartzy|work: danheberden: And to break out of whatever(), I need to set a flag in the .each() function, and return false when needed.. then outside check for the flag ?
22:19  peter2: temp01: he was drunk and frustrated and became rude
22:20  danheberden: not sure what whatever is
22:20  WebDragon: hmm just display: none;
22:20  danheberden: i, unlike the attentive people here, wasn't paying attention

23:23  WebDragon: not that there isn't a turn-down menu below the inputbox for events directly

23:24  Jarda: hmm... if I'm making a jquery ui widget intended to be published as open source, and have written pretty much custom stuff for it, and some of the stuff could be reused as an own plugin, should I divide the widget into widget+several plugins
23:24  Jarda: or does it make implementation harder..
23:24  eTiger13: keystr0k: what i was thinking is $('a[href*=.pdf|dwg|dxf]').attr('target', '_blank');  cc ajpiano am i totally off in that?
23:25  Jarda: or should I just include the custom stuff in the widget
23:25  keystr0k: eTiger13: I see... I'll give that a whirl. I def. didn't see that documented though... unless there's a general guideline somewhere about it... no biggie.
23:27  keystr0k: eTiger13: that doesn't work... thanks though...  I'll keep experimenting.
23:27  keystr0k: (and researching)
23:31  Bartzy|work: I have some weird behavior with stop()... :
23:31  Bartzy|work: $('#options_content').hide().stop().slideDown(1000);
23:31  Bartzy|work: I hope that's the correct way of doing it..
23:32  Bartzy|work: but when it happens a lot of times, the element height is getting less and less for some reason
23:32  eTiger13: BarryCarlyon_:  what do you think stop is doing there?
23:33  Cliyeh: can someonplease help.  I'm running into browser compatibilty issues on jquery script, and not sure where to start to debug
23:33  eTiger13: ?ask @ Cliyeh
23:33  bot-t: Cliyeh, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
23:34  Cliyeh: I have a rotating tab script, works fine on my dev browser, however on anoth PC I can only see the tabs but not the content of each tab when it rotates
23:34  Cliyeh: all I get is a blank box
23:34  Ryro: is the content being fetched via ajax?
23:35  eTiger13: Cliyeh: is it ajax loading the content? have you checked firebug?
23:35  Bartzy|work: anyone about the stop() ?
23:35  Cliyeh: i'm new to jquery. so I'm still learning
23:35  keystr0k: Looks like the last 2 comments here are from people who are trying to figure out the same thing: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
23:35  keystr0k: hehe
23:35  Ryro: Bartzy|work: it stops current animations on the selected object
23:35  Cliyeh: I'd built the tab as components from coldfusion cold
23:36  Bartzy|work: Ryro: Yep, but why the strange behavior ?
23:36  Bartzy|work: when I do $('#options_content').hide().stop().slideDown(1000);
23:36  Bartzy|work: a lot of times, the element height is getting smaller and smaller
23:36  Ryro: you are stopping the hide where it is
23:36  eTiger13: Bartzy|work: you are telling it to hide the element, then stop animating then animate it.
23:36  Bartzy|work: Right.
23:36  Ryro: hide is an animation, when you call stop it will stop it wherever its at
23:37  Ryro: try .hide(0)
23:37  JKarsrud_: hide without a parameter will instahide
23:37  Bartzy|work: Ryro: hide is instant... What's happening is if I click on a button that does this, and the animation slide if half way.. then the next time I click to do the animation, it will only go until the place I last stopped it.. understand ?
23:37  Cliyeh: but any reason why on one browser it works and another it doesn't?
23:37  keystr0k: later all, thanks for the help!
23:38  Ryro: Bartzy|work: hide isnt instant
23:38  Bartzy|work: Ryro: Without a parameter it is
23:38  Ryro: ??
23:38  Bartzy|work: It's not my problem. I described my problem above.
23:38  Ryro: k, but is hide really instant without a parameter?
23:39  eTiger13: Cliyeh:  did you do what i said?
23:39  Bartzy|work: JKarsrud_: Maybe you understood my problem ? :|
23:39  Cliyeh: yeah I'm looking at that area
23:41 * Ryro needs to keep his mouth shut today...
23:43  Cliyeh: etiger, page works fine in firefox
23:43  JKarsrud_: Ryro: show() and hide() will instantly show or hide elements (display: block and display: none) when you don't send in a speed
23:44 * Ryro says yep... im keeping my mouth shut
23:44  Bartzy|work: JKarsrud_: But why my element is getting shorter and shorter ? :\
23:44  Bartzy|work: slideDown will only animate to where stop() stopped ?
23:44  Bartzy|work: how can I fix that ?
23:45  Bartzy|work: I want to have a button that will animate using slideDown, but when the button is clicked again, the animation will stop and happen all over again until completion.
23:45 --- obsd123_ is now known as obsd123
23:46 * Ryro thinks... you should use animate instead of slide?
23:46  Bartzy|work: why ?
23:46  Bartzy|work: this is my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/d6ChS/
23:47  Bartzy|work: click on the button and then click again before the animation stops... it will animate the 2nd time only to where it stopped...
23:48  Ryro: try removing the height from the element style before calling slide down
23:48  Bartzy|work: how to do it efficiently ?
23:49  Ryro: .css('height', 'auto')
23:49  Bartzy|work: auto is the 'default' ?
23:49  Ryro: $('div').hide().stop().css('height', 'auto').slideDown(1000);
23:50  eTiger13: Bartzy|work: just remove the stop
23:50  nym_: heya SlexAxton
23:50  eTiger13: theres no reason for it
23:50  SlexAxton: sup nym_
23:50  Bartzy|work: eTiger13: But then if I click the button again it won't stop
23:50  nym_: SlexAxton: dude, do you know how to test Chrome 4.0?
23:50  eTiger13: stops for me and starts again
23:50  SlexAxton: nym_: don't
23:51 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
23:51  SlexAxton: no reason
23:51  SlexAxton: but if you must
23:51  nym_: SlexAxton: yeah my sentiments exactly, but tell that to my QA team who filed a bug
23:51  SlexAxton: find the install exe from back in the day
23:51  nym_: SlexAxton: yeah i've been looking
23:51  SlexAxton: fire up a clean xp vm
23:51  SlexAxton: turn off internet
23:51  SlexAxton: install
23:51  nym_: i tweeted paul_irish, is that a good way to hail him?
23:52  SlexAxton: he gets a lot of tweets, but he may be able to help
23:52  nym_: i figure since he works on the chrome team and all
23:52  SlexAxton: he doesn't test in 4.0 though
23:52  Ryro: stopping slide down before it completes leaves a height style set
23:52  nym_: lol i'm not sure who does
23:52  SlexAxton: i think it may be quicker to show the usage stats for 4.0
23:52  nym_: yeah, i'm looking for that too
23:52  SlexAxton: it's likely lower than 0.00001%
23:52  nym_: exactly
23:52  Cliyeh: eTiger, am I suppose to look for something in Firebug?
23:52  SlexAxton: i mean, likely less than 100 people world wide
23:53  SlexAxton: could possibly be on it
23:53  nym_: yeah, i need to track down something authoritative though to support my claim
23:53  Bartzy|work: eTiger13: Well, in the jsfiddle it does it for me too, but in my actual app it doesn't stop and starts over..
23:54  Ryro: is there a method that will complete the current animation instantly instead of stopping it in its tracks?
23:55  Ryro: Bartzy|work: http://jsfiddle.net/ryro/d6ChS/1/
23:55  nym_: SlexAxton: how's the R&D stuff going
23:55  nym_: SlexAxton: any projects you can share?
23:55  eTiger13: Bartzy|work: http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/d6ChS/2/
23:56  eTiger13: Ryro: way too complicated
23:56  Bartzy|work: Thank you both. eTiger13: I didn't understand why false,true works there.
23:57  Bartzy|work: no wait. eTiger13: That doesn't work on my app
23:57  Bartzy|work: Ryro's way works
23:57  Ryro: Bartzy|work: etigers way is best
23:57  eTiger13: Bartzy|work: what doesnt work about it? my way is the correct way
23:58  Bartzy|work: I sent you a pm with a link...
23:59  Cliyeh: ETiger, Can I pm you my link and see if you see anything weird as to why the rotating tab content is not showing up?
23:59  Bartzy|work: sorry eTiger13: Your way does work in my actual app (ofcourse :))
23:59  Bartzy|work: eTiger13: It didn't work at first because I put the stop AFTER the hide... then I changed it to your exact code and it works great. how come ?
23:59  eTiger13: because you want to stop the current animation and then hide it
