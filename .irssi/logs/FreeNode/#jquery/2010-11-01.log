00:19  OhaiBBQ: happy halloween everyone
00:20  vladikoff: OhaiBBQ, kjy112 -  halloweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen.js
00:20  darcyclarke: right back atcha
00:24 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
00:34  paul_irish: This ain't no trick! Here's a special treat for your Halloween night: We're back! yayQuery[20] - http://yayquery.com
00:34  paul_irish: OMGOGMGOMG
00:34  OhaiBBQ: ajpiano, paul_irish, rmurphey and SlexAxton: thanks for the new episode :D
00:34  ajpiano: :D
00:34  SlexAxton: yay
00:35  dabear_: ..query!
00:37  dabear_: bha
00:37  dabear_: seeking on vimeo doesn't work before the parts I wanna watch is downloaded
00:37  rmurphey: yah
00:38  SlexAxton: just download it straight up then
00:39  sheepz: jquery-ui's draggable should be released on releasing the mouse, right?
00:39  SlexAxton: usually
00:39 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
00:40  sheepz: hmm, i'm making a div visible via a right-click context menu
00:40  sheepz: i think this is why it only releases on right click
00:49  seancurtis: one thing has always annoyed me about yayquery
00:49  seancurtis: hurry up and release a damn T-shirt!
00:50  Brodingo: oh shi i forgot to buy a jquery shirt
00:50  ajpiano: haha, ok
00:50  kactas: Any advice on how to update a jqplot chart using set interval?
00:51  Brodingo: when i watch yayquery the dreaful miasma of everyday life is lifted and everything feels right in the world
00:52  Rappy: Is it possible to 'move' a DOM element to another element on the page without rewriting it?
00:53  seancurtis: ajpiano: just a nice black T with the yayquery logo across the back
00:53  seancurtis: style++
00:54  DanInMass: rappy this might help : http://www.elated.com/articles/jquery-removing-replacing-moving-elements/
00:55  Rappy: I'll look at it, thanks.
00:56  DanInMass: looks like you could use jq 1.4 , using the detach() and appendTo() methods
00:57  ajpiano: Rappy: $("#foo").appendTo("#bar") will move an element
00:59  Rappy: DanInMass, ajpiano - thanks. that's exactly what I was looking for.
00:59  astropirate: on the select event of a tab widget, what is "ui" parameter to the callback function referring to?
01:00  DanInMass:  ohh detahc() is for when you want to remove it temporarily and pull it back in later, whilst appendto will jsut move it right away
01:00  ajpiano: astropirate, the ui object is an object of parameters related to the event
01:00  ajpiano: like the panel, and the anchor clicked, for instance
01:01  astropirate: well i figured as much but which one is actually being passed? the div containing the tab element?
01:02  ajpiano: ?tias
01:02  bot-t: Try It And See
01:03  astropirate: ?me is a cylon. I don't die. I will keep coming back
01:03 * bot-t is a cylon. I don't die. I will keep coming back
01:03  astropirate: ?me kind of like a terminator but much more bad a**
01:03 * bot-t kind of like a terminator but much more bad a**
01:21  snover: astropirate: Don’t say ass!!!!!!!
01:21  snover: OH NO YOU MADE ME SAY ASS!!!! FUCK!
01:22  Lumpio-: Aww, gosh darn it!
01:22  astropirate: snover: you bad ass man. I wish i was as cool as you :-(   perhaps some day... someday...
01:24 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
01:32  snover: I am definitely a bad ass-man
01:35  revolveweb: im unsure the best way to something.... say I have a list of 10 links, when i click on the link i want to pass an id to a function
01:35  revolveweb: what is the best way to store an id to a link, i was told that adding an id as a rel is bad, what other way around it?
01:36  Jack_Franklin: revolveweb do you want to pass the ID of the <li> that was clicked?
01:36  revolveweb: sort of yeh
01:36  revolveweb: apparently having id="5" would also be bad as apparently best to have an id that does not start with numerical value
01:36  Jack_Franklin: $("li").click(function() {var theId = $(this).attr("id")})
01:36  Jack_Franklin: inside the click function you can use the 'this' keyword to refer to what was clicked
01:37  Jack_Franklin: or if you want to get the number of the <li> you should look at jQuery's index() http://api.jquery.com/index/
01:39  revolveweb: so i can just set an numerical value in the id tag and it isnt bad pracitce?
01:40  ajpiano: no
01:40  ajpiano: it is a bad practise
01:40  ajpiano: ids can't start with or be numeric
01:41  ajpiano: fwiw
01:41  ajpiano: ?valid id
01:41  bot-t: ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
01:41  revolveweb: right so...
01:41  revolveweb: back to the issue :]
01:42  revolveweb: what is the best way to go about what I want to do?
01:42  revolveweb: i have a numerical value i want to store on an item that when click it is passed to the function
01:42  snover: EXCEPT IN HTML5 WHICH IS AWESOME AND LETS YOU DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT
01:42  snover: WOOOO HTML5
01:42  snover: WOOOOOOOOOO
01:42  revolveweb: lol
01:43  ajpiano: use a data attribute probz
01:43  revolveweb: still need to get around to looking into html5 :|
01:43  snover: ?w html5 data attribute @ revolveweb
01:43  bot-t: snover, No results found for 'html5 data attribute'.
01:43  snover: oops
01:43  snover: ?g html5 data attribute @ revolveweb
01:43  bot-t: revolveweb, HTML5 Custom Data Attributes (data-*) | HTML5 Doctor - http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
01:43  snover: wow, did ejohn finally get knocked off as the top result for that query?
01:43  revolveweb: and data attribute would be backwards compatible?
01:44  ajpiano: yep, it would be
01:45  revolveweb: then, I have my solution, thanks :]
01:45  ajpiano: EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S SO BACKWARD COMPATIBLE THAT A DINOSAUR EATS YOU IF YOU USE
01:45  revolveweb: maybe i need to rethink then.... ive never been good at fighting dino's
01:46  snover: dinos*
01:46  ajpiano: haha snover i really want to file that as a bug againstthe new .data() ^^
01:46  snover: Somehow your apostrophe for “I’ve” went and made friends with the end of your sentence
01:46  ajpiano: Ticket 7742: A Dinosaur Eats You When You Use Data Attributes
01:47  revolveweb: snover, im tired
01:47  snover: ajpiano: wontfix: buy dinosaur insurance
01:47  ajpiano: worksforme: I am Turok, the dinosaur hunter
01:55  revolveweb: am i being stupid again? $('#' + $(this).attr('data-updateto')).val($(this).attr('data-id'));
01:55  revolveweb: I thought I could dynamically set data like that?
01:56  Jack_Franklin: i would do .data('title', 'value of this bit of data') revolveweb
01:56  revolveweb: why data over val?
01:57  Jack_Franklin: I'm not 100% sure you can use .val() to set data to be honest :P
01:58  revolveweb: you can
01:59  Jack_Franklin: fair enough
01:59  Jack_Franklin: you could try it the other way just to see?
01:59  ya: i just wrote something like if ($('.match').length == size) {..} then there is a warning telling me to use getElementbyId, why is that?
02:02  Jack_Franklin: what is giving you a warning?
02:03  ya: Jack_Franklin: I don't know the English version, but it means in general ID/NAME is not located in a global range, please use W3C standard document.getElementById()
02:04  Jack_Franklin: i can't say I've ever come across that
02:04  ManxPower: ya, you are checking the size of all elements with the class of "match".  I can see how that would not make sens, have you tried using an id= for what you are checking?
02:05  ya: ManxPower: i am makeing a puzzle thing, and i need to konw how much pieces is matched, so  i need to count that anyway...
02:21  revolveweb: say i have a form with 5 input boxes, and a list of 10 entries, if I click on any of the entries (which has an id assigned to it) I want to load the data from the database relating to that id into the 5 input boxes
02:22  revolveweb: what is the best way to achieve this?
02:23  revolveweb: obviously i can do an ajax lookup based on the id to pull back the records, but wondering a comprehensive way of doing it, so i can replicate the code on other pages relating to other tables etc
02:23  revolveweb: I was thinking about looping through all input values in a given form, then it would know what fields to pull back from any given table
02:24  danheberden: revolveweb: i assume you mean a select box?
02:25  revolveweb: no let me explain better
02:25  revolveweb: think of a database table, obviously in simple you have 4 functions from an account area: list, edit, add and delete
02:26  revolveweb: the list of a table data will be shown in a html table, if you click on any of the rows in the table I want it to load into a jquery popup with 5 fields, and auto load the data into the fields without having to reloat the page etc
02:27  danheberden: so if the row somewhere has <input type="hidden" value="theRowIdOrWhatever" /> you can do $('tr').click(function() { var $this = $(this); $this.find('input[name=id']
02:27  danheberden: meh, hit return too quick - but you get the idea?
02:27  revolveweb: ye that bit isnt the issue
02:27  revolveweb: its the loading of the data
02:28  revolveweb: after doing the ajax pull
02:28  danheberden: ya?
02:28  danheberden: so do your popup or whatever
02:28  danheberden: if the ajax success function is inline, you still have acess to the $this var
02:28  danheberden: which was the original row that was clicked
02:29  danheberden: so you can append or manipulate away
02:29  revolveweb: i will have the id yes but not the rest of the data needed
02:30  danheberden: isn't the rest of the data needed in the ajax call?
02:30  revolveweb: it sends the id and pulls back the data yes
02:32  danheberden: so in the success functino of the ajax call, you have your data
02:33  danheberden: and you have the original row that triggered the ajax call
02:33  danheberden: have fun - gotta man the door for trick-or-treaters :p
02:56  user_corrupt: ive set up the following mootools imagemenu on this page: http://www.petarivcec.com/camilopardo.com/artwork/ by referring to the script in the header file of my wordpress install: http://pastie.org/1263143 the problem is that mootools.js kills all of my jquery based plugins....is "noConflict mode" a possible solution, and could someone tell me about that?
02:57  youdontmeanmuch: user_corrupt: http://bit.ly/cLZBfW
02:58  vladikoff: user_corrupt, happens all the time to wordpress users, just google it up
02:58  user_corrupt: well, im googling it as well, its just that Im a real noob at js, and could maybe use some help
02:59  user_corrupt: thats a pretty neat link though
03:01  user_corrupt: so, should I be able to call jQuery.noConflict(); in my header here? http://pastie.org/1263143
03:02  user_corrupt: do i just put jQuery.noConflict(); somewhere, or is there more to it?
03:04  astropirate: I ask this question earlier but got no reply, so i guess i'll ask again: on the select event of a tab widget, what is "ui" parameter to the callback function referring to? that ui is it refering to? the one that triggered the event? the div holding the tab element? the tab pan?
03:04  Jack_Franklin: var $j = jQuery.noConflict()
03:04  Jack_Franklin: then use $j in place of $
03:04  Jack_Franklin: so $j("div")
03:12  iszak: or (function($){/* $ Haven */})(jQuery);
03:20  nvictor: hello people
03:20  nvictor: do we really need to write type="text/javascript" ?
03:21  hmd: nvictor, no
03:21  c_t_montgomery: if you are including a file, no...
03:21  c_t_montgomery: hmd, do we need to if it is inline js?
03:21  hmd: well it's not needed either way
03:21  nvictor: ok
03:21  c_t_montgomery: ok cool. i didn't know that -thank you.
03:21  hmd: If you validate against earlier DTD they may complain.
03:21  hmd: But HTML5 won't
03:21  hmd: And no browser would.
03:22  user_corrupt: Jack_Franklin: I'm sorry, I really have no idea what I am doing, here is the header.php where I am trying to resolve conflict between jquery and mootools: http://pastie.org/1263174 could you please enlighten me?
03:23  iszak: hmd++
03:23  user_corrupt: oops, jack is gone...
03:25  revolveweb: so when loading data dynamically through ajax, does that mean that any id's classes are not accessible?
03:27  revolveweb: because i have a div with id's and class's but when i use the .load to reload that div the id's and class's no longer function
03:31  revolveweb: anyone know?
03:34  user_corrupt: <n00b: can someone please enlighten me as to how I can set up no.Conflict for the mootools script that I have running here: http://pastie.org/1263190
03:35 --- cli is now known as chipnt
03:38  revolveweb: is it possible to access an id of an element if the id belongs to something created by .load?
03:43  Jonz: krevolveweb, i'm sure the answer is yes
03:43  revolveweb: well i cant :
03:43  Jonz: but you could just check it yourself probably faster than you could ask us..
03:45  revolveweb: well that is my issue, it isnt working for my and im trying to find out a) if its possible b) what i need to change
03:45  Jonz: something is wrong with your code then, because .load alters the DOM and then jquery can parse that DOM
03:46  revolveweb: it parses if i use .live but it cant with just .click
03:46  Jonz: .click binds only to the DOM that exists when you run the function
03:46  Jonz: .click will not bind to future elements that match the selector, that is why you would use .live
03:47  user_corrupt: 20$ for anyone who can help me fix this conflict between jquery and mootools
03:47  revolveweb: yeh but the issue there is if I use a plugin jquery file that is referencing .click it breaks, thus me wanting to find out if it is possible
03:49  iszak: user_corrupt, it's easy.
03:49  revolveweb: is there any way to get jquery to re-evaluate the code to reasssignw hat is needed
03:49  iszak: ?noConflict @ user_corrupt
03:49  bot-t: user_corrupt, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
03:49  revolveweb: rather than using .live so .click events still work?
03:50  Jonz: if you want to bind a click event to all elements that currently match, or will match in the future, a certain selector, then the correct thing to do would be to use .live, not .click
03:51  revolveweb: i see that jonz, issue being that im using plugins that use .click so wanting to see if there is an alternative way
03:52  Jonz: revolveweb, submit a patch to the plugin?
03:53  Jonz: you can hack your way around the issue and make the thing a complete mess or you can fix it cleanly, just my 2 cents
03:53  pw-toxic_: hi, i want to use an accordion with only one element, but it looks like this isnt meant to be used for one element only
03:54  pw-toxic_: how can i use the layout of accordion (styles) without defining it as an accordion?
03:57  revolveweb: so for example: content.bind('click',.....  how would I convert that to a live click
03:57  Jonz: content.live('click',...
03:57  revolveweb: so can ignore bind kk
03:57  revolveweb: tn
03:57  revolveweb: tnx*
04:00  revolveweb: in the places it has unbind, will that effect it now i have changed the bind methods to live?
04:01  Jonz: revolveweb http://api.jquery.com/die/
04:01  Jonz: bind is to unbind :: as live is to die
04:04  revolveweb: i guess i need to watch for all actions then not just click
04:07  disappearedng_: Hey how do I unbind this? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/284171/
04:08  Jonz: $node.unbind('mouseover mouseout');
04:09  Jonz: er.. $node.unbind('mouseover mouseout click');
04:09  disappearedng_: can I just unbind that 1 function?
04:09  disappearedng_: cause if there's something else on it
04:10  Jonz: unfortunately that is not how binding an event handler works
04:10  revolveweb: for some reason, the ajax being returned after a load is the same, i.e. it doesnt refresh, do i need to .live on load too?
04:10  Jonz: no more answers from me tonight, gotta get some work done, good luck revolveweb
04:11  revolveweb: ok tnx for assistance
04:11  Jonz: best advice i can give ya is to read the API on a function before asking questions about it, you'd be surprised how much info is in there
04:28  kalusn: how do i select everything _but_ an element? ie. if you click outside a div it is hidden
04:29 --- cli is now known as chipnt
04:44  BenMatthew: Hey, I have a overlay box that has is shown by toggleClass. How best is it to add a scroll bar?
04:44  BenMatthew: The only thing I can think of is using an iFrame.
04:44  revolveweb: overflow css?
04:45  Renacor: is there a plugin that makes working with canvas easier in jquery
04:45  Renacor: some default canvas functionality seems to be different when working with jquery
04:45  BenMatthew: revolveweb: Oh sweet, that helps.

05:13  paul_irish: hey everyone
05:13  paul_irish: whatd you dress up for halloween?
05:13  iszak: Myself.
05:13  paul_irish: scary!
05:13  iszak: I know!
05:13  zwalden: hah, my middle son tore up the customs my wife made for kids..
05:13  iszak: I even shaved.
05:14  zwalden: costumes, rather
05:14  paul_irish: hahaha
05:14  zwalden: so we figured they were monsters even w/o and let them just have at it regardless;P
05:14  paul_irish: hah
05:14  paul_irish: i'd be pissed if i was your woman.
05:14  zwalden: got 1,3,6,7 year olds haha
05:14 * zwalden shrugs
05:14  zwalden: she wasn't happy, but it happens with little ones
05:16  iszak: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/halloween
05:18  revolveweb: haha @ seniors
05:18  paul_irish: wait your 3rd old ripped up the costumes?
05:21  darcyclarke: gotta love halloween
05:21  paul_irish: darcyclarke: whatd you dress up as
05:22  darcyclarke: wore all black, put a postage stamp on me
05:22  darcyclarke: was black mail
05:22  darcyclarke: lol
05:23  darcyclarke: paul_irish you dress up?
05:23  paul_irish: hahahah
05:23  paul_irish: ya man.
05:23  paul_irish: dj lance rock of yo gabba gabba
05:24  darcyclarke: lmfao amazing
05:24  darcyclarke: so are we going to see more yayquery vids now or were we just lucky today?
05:25  paul_irish: Brodingo from this channel is putting together some yayQuery world tour footage
05:27  darcyclarke: paul_irish good to hear.. just putting together a pubsub post right now... going to pass out my library agnostic version
05:27  paul_irish: hawt
05:29  darcyclarke: paul_irish do you like the naming "publish" / "subscribe"... I find that a "hook" and adding / setting "hooks" seems to settle better in my mind (may be the server side MVC / CMS in me coming out)
05:30  paul_irish: hooks is super odd to me
05:30  darcyclarke: yea?
05:30  paul_irish: but more specifically
05:30  paul_irish: its not clear how adding/setting hooks is different
05:30  darcyclarke: its not
05:30  paul_irish: like a hook is only one side of the story
05:30  paul_irish: the metaphor
05:30  paul_irish: a hook hooks into somethingggg
05:30  paul_irish: and theres not a good word for the other side of it
05:30  paul_irish: so publish/subscribe... trigger/bind
05:30  darcyclarke: the hole ;)
05:31  paul_irish: broadcast/listen
05:31  paul_irish: velcro is hooks and loops, fwiw
05:31  paul_irish: not that i'm suggesting you name things velcro.js
05:31  paul_irish: because i'm not.
05:31  darcyclarke: lol
05:31  paul_irish: :)
05:32  astropirate: I ask this question earlier but got no reply, so i guess i'll ask again: on the select event of a tab widget, what is "ui" parameter to the callback function referring to? that ui is it refering to? the one that triggered the event? the div holding the tab element? the tab pan?
05:32  paul_irish: its the ui object
05:32  paul_irish: it has lots of goodies inside of it
05:32  darcyclarke: I liked hook though.. to name what it was.. then you would set and add to a "hook" which would be a point of integration
05:32  paul_irish: do console.dir(ui) inside of that callback sometime
05:32  astropirate: ok thanks
05:32  paul_irish: and you'll see that theres like.. ui.helper which is an element
05:32  paul_irish: and some other shit
05:33  paul_irish: darcyclarke: again. i hate "hook" as a term for htis
05:33  paul_irish: butttttttt be my guest
05:33  paul_irish: okay gotta practice a presentation
05:33  paul_irish: brbzz
05:33  darcyclarke: paul_irish cheers
05:47  hdon: does anyone here use jquery-inheritance?
05:48  coldhead: john resig's kids, when he dies?
05:49  paul_irish: hey everyone on a mac.. lets get into the halloween spirit.. hit cntrl-alt-command 8!
05:55  youdontmeanmuch: hdon: do you mean a plugin, or john resig's "simple class inheritance?"
05:57  hdon: youdontmeanmuch, http://code.google.com/p/jquery-inheritance/
05:57  youdontmeanmuch: hdon, whats your question?
05:59  enav: hello guy... im using maskedimput to format some dates.... welll in the moment that my form load up, the data field have some today date, but the problem is when i focus that field that value just go blank... why???
06:00  hdon: sorry, i shouldn't have asked to ask
06:00  enav: i whan that my date field preserve its original value
06:00  hdon: my question is: is there a known bug in using __base()?
06:00  hdon: every time i invoke it in any member function or the constructor, i get an error
06:00 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
06:02  hdon: hmm, it works in his example
06:02 * hdon investigates
06:02  youdontmeanmuch: is __base supposed to be like a super?
06:03  mcnellis: I'm trying to select all <tr> elements that have a child with a class ddlabel
06:03  mcnellis: I tried $('tr :contains(ddlabel)'); but that didn't work
06:03  snover: mcnellis: what are you trying to do?
06:04  mcnellis: loop through a really ugly table that has dozens of extra tr's and I want to sleect only the trs that have content which are tr's that have a td child that has a class of ddlabel
06:04  hdon: youdontmeanmuch, yes, at least from the example
06:04  youdontmeanmuch: mcnellis: will jQuery('tr .ddlabel'); work?
06:04 * hdon looks at the source
06:04  hdon: yeah that's certainly what it is
06:04  hdon: i must be doing something wrong. maybe a typo
06:05  snover: youdontmeanmuch: that doesn’t select the rows, it selects the .ddlabels
06:06  youdontmeanmuch: ooh i understand the question now
06:06  mcnellis: youdontmeanmuch: that gives me the td's
06:06  mcnellis: I want to select hte tr's so then I can loop over the tr and figure out which td it is (it's a calendar so i need to count from monday
06:06  hdon: hmm, in the example, he does not specify a constructor for his inherited class
06:06  hdon: perhaps it is not supported
06:07  snover: ?xy problem @ mcnellis
06:07  bot-t: mcnellis, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341

06:12  mcnellis: Here's the HTML I'm looping through: http://pastesite.com/19809 What i want to do is find only the <tr> elements that have at least one td.ddlabel
06:13  youdontmeanmuch: nice, he used neither lol

06:17  HappySinger: I'm getting 'Error: $(this).destroy is not a function'
06:17  youdontmeanmuch: mcnellis: http://jsfiddle.net/Ygvtn/
06:17  youdontmeanmuch: something like that
06:18  youdontmeanmuch: didn't get to test it because jsfiddle was being weird
06:18  youdontmeanmuch: so something might be wrong, but you get the idea
06:20  iszak: ygh
06:20  iszak: :( bad food is bad.
06:23  hdon: perhaps i used it wrong
06:23  hdon: because now i have it working
06:23  hdon: i should compare me old and new code
06:24  hdon: but i was just typing my old code into the command line
06:24  hdon: and now it's lost
06:24  HappySinger: Anyone any idea about my dialog() issue? I don't quite understand why I can't get it to destroy when I close it.
06:25  HappySinger: Ah, hang on.
06:26  HappySinger: I think I should be using dialog('destroy'), not destroy();

08:15  compaq: mekwall, thanks
08:15  mekwall: i bet someone else could give you a better explaination :)
08:15  mekwall: i just woke up
08:15  compaq: mekwall, not thats good enough, do you know of a nice stylish looking input box
08:16  compaq: mekwall, can you code in jquery, I read some tutorials yesterday, it's left me daunted.  So confusing
08:16  mekwall: yeah I bet it is :) until you figure out the pattern
08:16  compaq: This chaining, and stuff, woow, it wiill take a week get
08:17  mekwall: compaq, http://www.tuttoaster.com/enhancing-forms-using-jquery-ui/
08:17  mekwall: that might be something for you
08:17  compaq: And XPath, Sweet, let me check it out, thanks mekwall
08:19  mekwall: compaq, however... there's a debate about if it's right/wrong with theming input, buttons etc.
08:21  mekwall: compaq, not all people will find it user friendly with input/buttons etc. that's not looking like what they are used to :)
08:21  compaq: mekwall, hmm, I'm not at the debate level, as long as it works
08:21  mekwall: so it depends on the user base
08:23  compaq: mekwall, thats perfect
08:24  mekwall: compaq, they are doing a couple of mistakes in that tut though :)
08:24  compaq: mekwall, what are the mistakes?
08:25  mekwall: compaq, well... they aren't caching $(this) ... and not combining var defs
08:26 * doonie *gasps*
08:26  compaq: mekwall, hmm, I think that may be a problem.  Cause I want to use the form data immediately, and then append() to the page
08:26  mekwall: compaq, what do you mean by that?
08:27 * doonie points a finger at 1.4.3, you are one baggi baztardzzz
08:29  compaq: mekwall, I want to put the Form on the page.  I am plan to only have one input box.  And then I want to use the data input, and post something below using append() so it show up dynamically on t he page.  Also, i wanted to use that other jquery thing, I forget what its called.  But it sets the format.  I want the format to be only letters, or only letters and numbers, so if use tries to enter anything other than that, it won't let you ente
08:29  compaq: r, I am gonna look that last thing up and inform you of it if you never seen it before
08:31  compaq: mekwall,  http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
08:31  compaq: mekwall, I could probably just style the form nice with CSS
08:31  compaq: I think I am just gonna use this one

11:57  compaq: Cork, thanks
12:04  compaq: Cork, hmm, its still not working
12:05  Cork: compaq: are you running it in $(function() {}); or .ready?
12:05  compaq: Cork, $(function() {});, isn't it the same thing
12:05  Cork: compaq: the html has to be parsed before you change focus or it will just be reset
12:06  Cork: compaq: ya, just checked that you did it :)
12:06  compaq: Cork, oh wait, I spotted a mistake, let me see now
12:06  Cork: compaq: but that line should work, i use it all over the place
12:07  compaq: Cork, haha, nevermind, it was my mistake.  Thanks so much for helping, you did it.  focus()
12:07  compaq: Cork, I had )}; by mistake
12:07  Cork: :)

13:21  mynk: sorry for my english..
13:21  compaq: I have some document.write functions that I use for one of my pages.  I was thinking of changing them to jquery, but then I thought, they should stay in javascript since they are part of the page
13:21  JKarsrud: mynk: Do you have some codE?
13:21  JKarsrud: compaq: Why are you using document.write?
13:21  mynk: yes

13:22  compaq: JKarsrud, I have images named a.jpg, b.jpg, c.jpg...z.jpg, and I instead of punching them in 1 by 1 in html, I just use a for loop and document.write
13:22  JKarsrud: but why do you use document.write?
13:23  JKarsrud: :/
13:23  compaq: JKarsrud, document.write("<img src=\"alpha-images/" + alphabetString[i] + ".jpg\" width=\"50\" height=\"75\"/>"+" ");
13:23  JKarsrud: why not create elements?
13:24  JKarsrud: But sure, I won't tell you what you should and shouldn't do :)
13:24  compaq: hmmm, so you think it would be better to use jquery?
13:24  JKarsrud: yeah, or create the elements with plain JS
13:25  compaq: JKarsrud, Can you show me.  I had trouble creating element in JS that why I started using jquery, but I am still new to both
13:27  JKarsrud: var elem = document.createElement("img"); elem.src = "alpha-images/" + alphabetString[i] + ".jpg"; elem.width = "50"; elem.height = "75"; someContainer.appendChild(elem); something like that
13:28  JKarsrud: compaq: http://www.dustindiaz.com/add-and-remove-html-elements-dynamically-with-javascript/
13:28  JKarsrud: Or use setAttribute
13:28  compaq: JKarsrud, yep, it looks like a good link, the last time I was looking, I must have typed another search term, cause the link I found didn't work, but this one will work for sure.
13:29  compaq: JKarsrud, When will it occur, cause I know JQuery happens after the document loads, so this script will happen during, since there is no document.ready
13:29  JKarsrud: Yeah, dustin knows his stuff, and the code still looks correct
13:29  JKarsrud: depends on where you put it
13:30  JKarsrud: If you put it in the end of your document, aka. before the </body>, it will be run after the dom is ready
13:30  compaq: JKarsrud, well, I was thinking I would put a link in the <head> and then put the script in another file
13:30  JKarsrud: But why won't you do it with jQ?
13:31  mynk: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/284305/
13:31  JKarsrud: Then you can't be sure that the DOM is fully loaded
13:31  mynk: when the li`s showin up again it lost the background i set from css..
13:31  compaq: JKarsrud, I would like to do it in JQ, But I was thinking, since it is part of the page, I should wait for the page to load, it should load with the page
13:32  compaq: JKarsrud, I read that JQuery is good for dynamic elements
13:32  JKarsrud: compaq: Well, if you want to load stuff with the page, you should put it in the markup, or else there will be some sort of delay
13:33  JKarsrud: But I have to work now :)
13:33  compaq: JKarsrud, I think I will do it in JQuery anyway

13:40  Ely: Hi
13:41  Ely: I've got an issue here: http://jsfiddle.net/mwM5F/10/ .. when I try to toggle the borders back off the ID should be deleted as well. But for the divs that have content is stays. how can I solve this, my last code does not do the trick
13:43  mekwall: Ely, removeAttr ?
13:43  sean`: Ely, jQuery('.DNNEmptyPane').toggleClass('NotDNNEmptyPane');
13:43  sean`: that won't work
13:44  sean`: If you remove the classyou'res electing by, the result will be false
13:44  mekwall: Ely, what exactly do you want to do?
13:44  sean`: Cache your selectors!~
13:44  mekwall: sean`, it's not the same class
13:44  sean`: yeah
13:44  sean`: What made you think I said that
13:45  sean`: :p
13:45  mekwall: sean`, lol
13:46  mekwall: Ely, your code is a mess... if you tell me what you want to do I might be able to help you :)
13:47  Ely: well, i want to border all classes that start with dnn_ end on pane but do not include ctr
13:47  Ely: plus i want the id of that div be on the top of that div
13:47  Ely: inside that var panename
13:47  Ely: + when the div is not empty and I toggle everything of the pane ID should disappear as well
13:48  Ely: plus what I was planning to do was to trim the dnn_ from teh ID thatname that is displayed
13:49 --- carter05 is now known as carter05_
13:52  Ely: that is what I want to to mekwall :p
13:52  Cork: Ely: you sould add another generic class to the elements instead
13:52  Ely: I tought I was doing pretty good for myself : D
13:52  sean`: So
13:52  Cork: its simpler and faster
13:52 * sean` is playing with jquerymobile
13:53  mekwall: Ely, those selectors are really ugly :P
13:53  mekwall: Ely, did you create those ids?
13:53  mekwall: I mean, do you have control over them?
13:54  Ely: no mekwall
13:55  drim: I have a function which change the submit button background ($(this).css(...)). If I do $(form).submit(); just after, the background is not loaded and the submit button is blank. How could I prevent it ?
13:56  Ely: the ids what they are, I can't change them
14:01  mekwall: Ely, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mwM5F/11/ <--- something like that?
14:02  Ely: well yes mekwall that's what I had with some messy code :p
14:03  mekwall: Ely, so that's what you wanted?
14:03  Ely: but when I toggle the help off the id name aobve every div content should be gone
14:03  Ely: + the dnn_ should be trimmed of in the ID name
14:03  Ely: not in the code
14:03  mekwall: Ely, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mwM5F/12/
14:03  Ely: only the output
14:03  mekwall: sorry... forgot to replace .html() with .empty() :)
14:04  Ely: got it
14:04  Ely: looks nice
14:07  dinosaadeh_: guys dont these two return string for my comparison? (bullets[i].id == $(bulletNode).attr('id')).. id attribute of elements
14:07  mekwall: Ely, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mwM5F/13/
14:07  mekwall: less code
14:07  mekwall: same result
14:07  Ely: true
14:08  Ely: i'll study that
14:08  Ely: thank you
14:08  mekwall: np
14:08  Ely: can the dnn_ be trimmed of as well?
14:08  mekwall: ofc

15:14  Torninator: I've had to use display: none; instead
15:15  mekwall: Torninator, because show use display: none
15:15  mekwall: Torninator, I mean... it uses the display css attribute
15:15  mekwall: property*
15:15  Torninator: ah ok
15:16  Torninator: I tried doing it manually with $('#myDiv').style.visibility
15:16  AlexA: ok i'm stumped:))
15:16  Torninator: but apparently the 'style' attribute of my div was undefined
15:16  mekwall: Torninator, $('#myDiv')[0].style.visibility
15:16  mekwall: will work
15:16  Torninator: aha, why the [0]?
15:16  JKarsrud: Torninator: $('#myDiv').css('visibility', 'hidden') will also work
15:16  mekwall: Torninator, because it's a jQuery set (array)
15:17  Torninator: oh the id selector is always an array?
15:17  mekwall: Torninator, can be multiple elements
15:17  Torninator: cheers
15:17  mekwall: Torninator, no $(selector) returns a jQuery object... you can accesss the html elements directly through the array

15:28  androoid: JKarsrud, is there a way to select by a specific class?
15:28  mekwall: AlexA, that's an array :)
15:28  mekwall: AlexA, data[0].title ?
15:28  JKarsrud: sure, $('link.className')
15:28  AlexA: pls wait
15:28  androoid: godlike!
15:28  androoid: ty
15:28  mekwall: haha JKarsrud !
15:28  JKarsrud: jQuery uses standard CSS selctors
15:28  mekwall: if you're a god for providing that solution...
15:29 * JKarsrud is godlike
15:29  mekwall: i don't even know what I am :p
15:29  toxster: can i have multiple subscribers to a jquery custom event?
15:29  JKarsrud: toxster: yeah
15:29  androoid: ;)
15:29  AlexA: of i love you mekwall
15:29  JKarsrud: But don't use custom events
15:29  AlexA: you are my god
15:29  mekwall: haha :)
15:29  AlexA: that damn [0]
15:29  mekwall: AlexA, well... [] will be parsed as an array {} as an object
15:29  toxster: what should i use?
15:30  mekwall: AlexA, [{}] object inside an array :)
15:30  AlexA: ok ok but what do i do when i don't know the number of elements in the array?
15:30  mekwall: toxster, bind?
15:30  toxster: i have some charts on a page, for each chart i want to subscribe when a param changes, and when i changes, i fire an event which each chart executes
15:30  mekwall: AlexA, for or .each
15:31  mekwall: loop through the array
15:31  AlexA: thats what i thought :D
15:31  JKarsrud: toxster: use some proper pubsub plugin instead, I recommend this one by peter higgins: http://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
15:31  mekwall: AlexA, i'd probably do $.each(data, function(i,o){ ... });
15:31  l4rk: toxster: if a param changes the page refreshes
15:31  AlexA: i really hated javascript but i'm starting to like it :D
15:31  l4rk: perhaps use hashchange instead?
15:31  mekwall: AlexA, o will contain .id .title etc.
15:31  toxster: will check it out, thanks JKarsrud
15:32  JKarsrud: toxster: Then you won't have to deal with all sorts of event stuff that jquery puts into it's custom events :)
15:32  AlexA: and the call will me o.id or o[i].id ?
15:32  toxster: sounds sweet
15:32  AlexA: will be*

15:33 --- keystr0k_ is now known as keystr0k
15:33  toxster: thanks jkarsrud!
15:33  JKarsrud: If you've used custom events up till now, the job to switch from trigger to $.publish and $.subscribe is easy :)
15:34  JKarsrud: toxster: But ncie to see more people using pubsub principles, it can definately DRY your code somewhat
15:35  toxster: jkarsrud: up untill 5 minutes ago, i wasnt event sure on how to accomplish what i needed to have done, im gonna check out so that pubsub is what i've meant
15:35  JKarsrud: yeah
15:35  JKarsrud: publish and subscribe
15:36  JKarsrud: publish a topic, and let other parts of your code subscribe to the topic/message
15:43  mekwall: AlexA, if you are looping through it with .each it.s just o.id
15:44  AlexA: yeah yeah did that no errors but i broke it again :))
15:44  mekwall: AlexA, if you use for then you'd probably have to do data[i].id :)
15:44  mekwall: AlexA, wht now?
15:44  AlexA: http://alexalexandrescu.co.cc/gallery/test.php view source
15:44  toxster: JKarsrud: yeah i guess that'll do it
15:45  toxster: i want to pass params to each page. no idea if it'll do that
15:45  JKarsrud: No, you'll have to do that yourself
15:46  toxster: so pubsub is nothing for me ?
15:48  AlexA: so mekwall where did i go wrong this time?:))
15:49  mekwall: AlexA, $("result").text(+items.title); <--- what's with the + ?
15:49  mekwall: AlexA, also.. that would replace the text in result for every loop
15:49  mekwall: AlexA, don't you want to append the results  ?
15:50  AlexA: the + is for an error in firebug i want to do that but don't know how :D
15:50  mekwall: AlexA, try this: $("result").append('<p>'+items.title+'</p>');
15:50  mekwall: eh
15:50  mekwall: $('#result
15:50  mekwall: lol
15:50  AlexA: whats with my result:))
15:51  AlexA: updated yet same result
15:51  mekwall: AlexA, it's $('#result').append('<p>'+items.title+'</p>');
15:51  mekwall: what you did would be looking for an element named result, not an id
15:52  AlexA: and again same result:)))

16:02  mekwall: dwarder, yeah I understand that now hehe
16:02  ajpiano: you want an offline jquery refrence that will work on your windows mobile phone?
16:02  mekwall: that's what he want :)
16:02  ajpiano: aha.
16:02  Krinkle: Hi, I'm curious if someone here knows if jQuery changes it's selector when filter() is called or that it's a DOM element array already. Basically, I've got this line here:
16:02  Krinkle: $('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6').filter( ':has(.editsection a)' ).bind( 'contextmenu', function( e ) {
16:02  Krinkle: I'd like to make that live() instead of bind()
16:03  ajpiano: Krinkle: you can't use .live() against an arbitrary set of elements, only directly against a selector
16:03  ajpiano: but you can use delegate
16:03  Krinkle: ajpiano: I think you can see why I use filter since It's abit cleaner to not repeat the :has part 6 times.
16:03  brombomb_work: I am trying to get a jquery UI date picker to update the next instance of a datepicker to the same time + 1 hour.  I think I want to use the onSelect property but can't seem to get it working.
16:03 --- steadicat is now known as singacat
16:04  Krinkle: So, delegate. Hm...
16:04  ajpiano: yeah i realise why you're using it i'm just saying you can't use live that way
16:05  Krinkle: But I can use delegate() ?
16:05  ajpiano: you might be able to
16:05  Krinkle: the page can have <h2>'s dynamically inserted.
16:05  Krinkle: but only those inserted with a <span class="editsection"><a /></span> should match
16:06  revolveweb: oh yeh Jonz I finally got that script working last night I was doing :]
16:06  ajpiano: Krinkle: are there going to be any "span.editsection a" that AREN'T in h1...h6 tags?
16:07  mintsauce: To answer my own question: var id = $(this).attr("class").replace('recent-aq-thumb-','').split(" ")[0];
16:07  Krinkle: ajpiano: Yes, that is possible. On initial page load there are ".editsection a" outside of the headings. Dynamically inserted are only <h1-6> which may or may not have an editsection link.
16:07  ajpiano: k
16:08  Krinkle: would it work if I just copt the :has() part 6x times making the first selector complete and then bind live()  ?
16:08  Krinkle: s/copt/copy
16:09  Krinkle: I hope there's a cleaner way though. But if it has to, I'll take it.
16:09  ajpiano: krinkle $(document).delegate("span.editsection a","contextmenu",function(e) { if ($(e.target).closest("h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6").length) { }   });
16:09  ajpiano:  ?
16:09 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
16:09  ner0x: Is it possible to "add classes" to live objects?
16:11 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
16:11  Krinkle: ajpiano: Interesting. Is delegate required here though ? the $("span.editsection a").live("contextmenu", function(e){ if e.target closest length....
16:11  Krinkle: I didn't think about e.target.
16:11  ajpiano: i don't know if live actually supports contextmenu
16:11  ajpiano: you could do it that way as well
16:11  Krinkle: oh, right.
16:11  Krinkle: Okay, thanks. I'll try both. Thanks
16:12  Jonz: revolveweb, glad to hear that ;()

16:33  freedgy: mandric: $.post has a callback function for when a request is complete
16:33 --- boaz_ is now known as boaz
16:33  mandric: freedgy: but i can't use a callback because i'm not in the application when i'm testing.
16:34  mandric: i just need an attribute or function i can check to see when all ajax requests have completed.
16:35  Kindari|work: mandric: http://agilesoftwaretesting.com/?p=111
16:35  mlechner: mekwall: if i click the "i"-Button in the lower left corner it opens an the text is white on blue. if i close it and open it again it the text (and just the textpart) shows up as black on transparent. it flashes back to white on blue for a short moment while closing the info-area again. May be i forgot: this happens on Firefox. It works fine on Opera. Can really nobody reproduce this?
16:35  mekwall: mlechner, works in webkit as well... will check in mozilla
16:36  mekwall: mlechner, yup... it fails in mozilla :)
16:36  mekwall: mlechner, remove background-color:inherit;
16:36  mekwall: mlechner, from .text p
16:37  mlechner: mekwall: i will do that, but it won't change anythong, because it happened before i created this css-entry
16:37  mandric: Kindari|work: so jQuery.active then ... strange i don't see that attr in the debug window. trying ...
16:37  mekwall: mlechner, hmm ok... interesting
16:38 * mlechner is starting eclipse
16:38  mekwall: mlechner, ahhh! it's selecting the text
16:38  mekwall: mlechner, no idea why... how are you binding to the click/toggle event?
16:39  mlechner: mekwall: but how comes? you can not unselect it while it  is open - it doesn't do anything with a picture if i put it in - wait a second
16:39  mandric: Kindari|work: thanks jQuery.active does the trick
16:39  JKarsrud: Is there a way to send accept headers with jquery ajax?
16:39  mekwall: mlechner, are you binding to mousedown perhaps?
16:39  mandric: Kindari|work: also, nice post.
16:40  timing: JKarsrud: shouldn't the server send accept headers?
16:40  JKarsrud: timing: Isn't accept something that is part of the request?
16:40  JKarsrud: not the response?
16:41  timing: o you mean telling the server what you accept?
16:41  timing: sorry, misunderstood
16:41  mlechner: mekwall: I'm binding to click
16:42  mekwall: mlechner, hm. very interesting
16:42  JKarsrud: timing: yeah
16:42  timing: JKarsrud: in the beforeSend callback you can add headers to the request
16:43  JKarsrud: ahh, cool, I'll check it out :)
16:43  timing: the lowlevel xmlhttprequest object is passed to it
16:43  timing: x.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'text/plain');
16:43  mlechner: mekwall: and you are right the text is selected -> a Ctrl+C copies it to the clipboard
16:43  timing: JKarsrud: ^
16:43  JKarsrud: Cool cool
16:43  timing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields
16:43  mekwall: mlechner, yeah... it will deselct it before the animation to close it fires
16:44  oralo: should i be combining html5 boilerplate w/ css yui grids?
16:45  mlechner: mekwall:but how not to select it anyhow?
16:46  JKarsrud: timing: yeah, didn't work though. Firebug still sais */*.. I'll look into it more :)
16:46  mekwall: mlechner, I've never actually seen that before...
16:46  ruquay: i have a script that broke with jquery 1.4.3.  i have been using the global ajax listener to catch http 403 codes, pop up a login dialog, and then repeat the ajax request that was 'trying' to execute when the 403 code was received.  this worked in 1.4.2, but in 1.4.3 i am getting a stack overflow from the jQuery.extend method.
16:46  mekwall: mlechner, must be something else interfering
16:46  ruquay: i wanted to ask if what i am doing is a crazy way to do it, or if 1.4.3 actually broke something.
16:46  mekwall: mlechner, if you click in it and drag outside of ff window it will deselect the text ;)
16:47  mekwall: mlechner, probably need to hook into onselectstart or something
16:49  mekwall: mlechner, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2700000/how-to-disable-text-selection-using-jquery
16:50  mekwall: try that one
16:51  mekwall: mlechner, since it's only happening in mozilla... adding -moz-user-select: none;
16:51  mekwall:  to that class should be sufficient
16:51  mekwall: and stupid newline copy/paste

17:01  bnb_dev: ajpiano: ablomen:
17:01  SkramX: ** why would jQuery("#div") work but not $("#div") work?
17:01  bnb_dev: i explain
17:01  ajpiano: SkramX, cause jQuery.noConflict was run
17:01  ajpiano: SkramX are you using wordpress
17:01  bnb_dev: i have a php for loop and inside the loop there are text boxes
17:02  SkramX: ajpiano - yeah, this issue is of a user using my plugin
17:02  bnb_dev: i want when i click or type in each text box
17:02  SkramX: ajpiano can you explain?
17:02  bnb_dev: then
17:02  ajpiano: SkramX: wordpress uses jQuery.noConflict by default
17:02  ajpiano: so you have to use jQuery, not $
17:02  bnb_dev: a function check the value is greater or not?
17:02  SkramX: ajpiano - and itll work all the same?
17:02  ajpiano: yep
17:02  bnb_dev: mostly we access using the css and id selectores
17:02  SkramX: ajpiano - can I use jQuery() in my other code too?
17:03  ajpiano: yes
17:03  bnb_dev: but how i do access them?
17:03  SkramX: AKA it'll always work and $ is just a convenience?
17:03  ajpiano: you can also do (function($) {  //here you can safely use $ as alias for jQuery  })(jQuery);
17:03  bnb_dev: ajpiano: i hope u will understand my question

17:07  mekwall: mlechner, probably due to the popup having display: block :P

17:29  SugaSlide: nopes
17:29  SugaSlide: just cause its at the end doesnt necisarily mean its all "ready"
17:30  SugaSlide: so its still a good idea to have the .ready() there
17:30  BAsM: u mean the at the end the dom is no yet loaded
17:30  l4rk: Putting it there is useful if the code ever gets shifted around
17:30  l4rk: depending on the position of the code within the markup isnt' always the smartest engineering decision
17:31  l4rk: although it should work just fine before </body>

18:48  ajpiano: and then causes the whole cycle to repeat

19:36  gnarf: like they clicked submit button on form?
19:36  solars: yeah, just a normal form
19:36  gnarf: then $("#myForm").submit() works
19:36  solars: its a link actually, thats why I ask
19:36  gnarf: unless you have <input name="submit"> or <input id="submit">
19:36  solars: alright, thanks!
19:36  solars: yeah
19:37  gnarf: there is a DOM issue there
19:37  draginx: For when you have an onclick that just shows/hide a div with a very small set of information (in other words it owuld be a total waste to just make a page for this set of info) what's the appropriate way of href'ing the <a> tag? I know in JS you have to return false; but javascript:void(0); and "#" are looked down upon ya? Or is it reasonable :S

20:03  domcat: hello is it possible to bind "2 events to element"? I have a link and I have .mouseover() on it, but I would like to have .click() on it as well. Don't want to duplicate the whole code that is in the mouseover part. Any ideas?
20:03  hdon: gnarf, what did i do wrong?
20:03  gnarf: it should give you all the DOM elements that have an id property
20:03  ajpiano: domcat: $("foo").bind("click mouseover",fn);
20:03  hdon: ah yes, that's what i meant
20:03  hdon: but for some reason, i only get one element via console.log()
20:03  domcat: ajpiano: cool thanks
20:03  hdon: in fact
20:04  gnarf: btw, the element is "this"
20:04  gnarf: k is just an 'index'

20:05  gnarf: also the element
20:05  gnarf: :)
20:05  hdon: ah ok
20:05  hdon: well in any case this is interesting:
20:05  gnarf: got a fiddle?
20:05  hdon: http://codebad.com/~donny/dom-id-jquery.png
20:05  hdon: check out the last two lines executed in firebug
20:06  hdon: one uses .filter() with a function that returns v.hasOwnProperty('id')
20:06  hdon: only one DOM element makes it into the result
20:06  gnarf: hdon: hasAttribute
20:06  hdon: but the second way selects for id in the jquery selector
20:06  hdon: gnarf, oh you're right
20:06  gnarf: and
20:06  gnarf: [id] is shorter
20:06 * hdon has been living in non-browser javascript land too long
20:06  hdon: thanks for that tip, i didn't realize
20:06  gnarf: than [id!=""]
20:06  gnarf: $("[id]")
20:07 * hdon nods
20:07  hdon: thanks, using hasOwnProperty() instead of hasAttribute() was my mistake
20:07  hdon: been doing too much server-side javascript ;)
20:07  gnarf: hdon: simpler
20:07  gnarf: if (v.id)
20:08  gnarf: cuz its value wont ever be "falsy"
20:08  gnarf: and if it is, u dont care about it
20:08  hdon: gnarf, well the only falsy string is "" which i think is the same as not being specified
20:08  gnarf: yup
20:08  hdon: but i also have a habit now of
20:08  gnarf: its a good habbit
20:08  hdon: not checking for property existence
20:08  hdon: with x.y
20:09  gnarf: its a great habbit
20:09  hdon: because Spidermonkey in strict mode spits out warnings
20:09  gnarf: but in some cases
20:09  gnarf: you want that "or case"
20:09  gnarf: like the property exists AND has a true value
20:09  hdon: in fact i have this function with me at all times: getprop(o,k){return o.hasOwnProperty(k)?o[k]:void 0}
20:09  hdon: indeed
20:10  gnarf: thats so yuck
20:10  gnarf: :)
20:10  Jarda: is there an event fired when an element is added to dom?
20:10  gkatsev: why return void 0 and not just return undefined?
20:10  gnarf: Jarda: no
20:10  hdon: gnarf, yeah i know
20:10  gnarf: at least not crossbrowser
20:10  gkatsev: hdon: ^
20:11  Jarda: gnarf: how about to some specific element? I mean if I do $('#myElement').append(otherElement); can I somehow listen to #myElement additions?
20:11  gnarf: Jarda: you could call code or trigger your own event
20:11  hdon: gkatsev, undefined is a global variable and can be overridden by sloppy programmers or a bug
20:11  capitan: is it just me, or does userscripts.org suck?
20:12  gkatsev: hdon: ok, I guess that is a valid reason.
20:12  hdon: gkatsev, void is an unary operator that evaluates its operand and always returns the supposed value of undefined :)
20:12  gnarf: Jarda: or wrap that specific case in something like:
20:12  gnarf: function appendToElement(content) { $('#myElement').append(content); // do something with content }

20:14  Jarda: gnarf: I'm writing an ui widget so I can't count on people calling something specific
20:14  Jarda: or I would not want to
20:14  gnarf: you would also probably not want to setInterval() poll
20:14  gnarf: but
20:14  gnarf: for your "widget"
20:14  gnarf: you want to write a .myWidget('updateContent') or something similar
20:15  gnarf: and document that if you append something, u need to call that
20:15  Jarda: gnarf: yeah, I could do that.. maybe that's the only way

20:56  bla: Hi.
20:56  rhizmoe: is that a kind of beer?
20:57  bla: How can I check in firebug why form doesn't trigger a submit event when I click submit button or hit enter in input? (I can trigger submit event manually but it is not triggered when I trigger click event on submit button)
20:57  rhizmoe: bla: click "console," reload, and do your stuff. see if any red appears in the console pane.
20:58  bla: Nothing. Also nothing in java console
20:58  Cork[home]: bla: check so your html validates
20:58  rhizmoe: well, i don't know that the java console is helpful here.
20:58  Cork[home]: might be something as simple as the form ends before the button
20:58  rhizmoe: trudat
20:59  bla: It's certainly not this, but I'll recheck the HTML, it might be something weirder.
20:59  Cork[home]: (error correction can do that, even if it looks correct)
20:59  bla: I've tested it with jquery selectors; it finds input[type=submit] inside form.
20:59  Cork[home]: bla: run it through a validator
20:59  Cork[home]: bla: that selector dosn't mean the button is in a working form
21:00  bla: Cork[home], $('.superpager form input[type="submit"]').click()  <- like this.
21:00  Cork[home]: ya
21:00  Cork[home]: you could halt on events and see what you get
21:01  rhizmoe: the docs for jqui autocomplete state that it should be called on an input field, for degradation purposes can i do something that replaces the dropdown select i have for html with the autocomplete text input?
21:02  bla: Cork[home], oh, good idea
21:02  eTiger13: rhizmoe: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
21:03  rhizmoe: hah, perfect!
21:04  rhizmoe: thanks :) you know, i alwasy look past that right sidebar of additional info. i don't think it's very ergo for its purpose.
21:04  Dracos_: right side blindness strikes again
21:04  rhizmoe: right? i bet it's a long-standing issue.
21:05  Dracos_: it is, google the term
21:05  rhizmoe: that's as "i know, right?" rather than "right side?"
21:07  rhizmoe: apparently web design shares this weakness with colonoscopies. who knew?
21:08 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
21:08  bla: Form sees events of it's inputs (like enter keydown) but on one page they cause submit, on second - not. When they work there's also DOMActivate event.
21:08  rhizmoe: are you trapping enter on the second case?
21:09  rhizmoe: but not the first?
21:09  rhizmoe: since enter=submit by default
21:10  bla: Hm. I've enabled registering all events on <form> tag in firebug
21:10  eTiger13: ?p @ bla
21:10  bot-t: bla, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
21:10  bla: There's correctly bound .submit event in both cases.
21:10  bla: eTiger13, I'd have to do a testcase. It's impossible to paste the code like it's now.
21:11  bla: I'll dig on it a bit more if nothing helps I'll try with testcase. But since it works in one case it's probably kind of ugly error
21:18  bla: Ok, it seems to be caused by live event handler which is matching elements near this form.
21:20  bla: The same with a delegate.
21:21  eTiger13: huh?
21:22  bla: Ok. Let's sum it up a bit. I've got div#kanapa_lista which has descendants: a form, and a table. form is not in a table and table is not in a form.
21:22  rhizmoe: hah, that combobox autocomplete is...involved
21:22  bla: After adding code like:     $('#kanapa_lista table').delegate('tr', 'click',
21:22  bla: Submit events in form die.
21:22  bla: Without this single delegate everything is ok.
21:23  Lindrian: hmm
21:23  Lindrian: can I in jquery set a post variable?
21:23  Lindrian: so when I later on submit my form I can use that variable?
21:23  bla: Lindrian, insert hidden input into the form
21:24  SugaSlide: or just add it to the data thing
21:24  SugaSlide: or url
21:25  SugaSlide: datarcal: "name="+value+"&"+$(this).serialize()
21:25  SugaSlide: data : "name="+value+"&"+$(this).serialize()
21:25  SugaSlide: etc
21:25  bla: Summed up: I've got div#container with two descendants: a form, and a table. When adding delegate to the div#container form submit event is not triggered by submit button. If mounting this delegate directly on a table everything works.
21:25  bla: I guess this is some jquery bug in handling form. There (I heard) are few of those.
21:27  rhizmoe: is ui.* a jqui builtin selector-y method?
21:28  ajpiano: no
21:28 --- Killswitch__ is now known as Killswitch
21:28  ajpiano: rhizmoe: ui does autmatically expose a bunch of selectors though, like you can do $(":ui-sortable")
21:28  eTiger13: bla:  why are you adding click to tr and not td?
21:29  eTiger13: bla:  is your submit button named submit?
21:29  rhizmoe: i'm seeing "ui.combobox" in demo source
21:30  rhizmoe: but it appears it's part of something being built, so maybe it's a structural name
21:30  ajpiano: oh
21:30  ajpiano: that's cause that demo builds a new widget on top of an existing one
21:31  tesseracter: so does $('mycheckbox').trigger('click') actually make the checkbox go on and off? i can't seem to make that happen.
21:31  ajpiano: $.widget("namespace.widgetname",{}) is instantiating the widget factory, rhizmoe
21:32  rhizmoe: gotcha. so there's a namespace of interesting stuff somewhere :)
21:32  Brodingo: tesseracter i believe triggering click that way only triggers jquery events bound to that object
21:32  bla: eTiger13, no, it doesn't have a name even.
21:32  ajpiano: $.widget("namespace.widgetname") will create jQuery.namespace and then jQuery.namespace.widgetname.prototype
21:32  ajpiano: all the ui stuff, for that reason, lives in jQuery.ui
21:32  tesseracter: Brodingo, ah, interesting.
21:33  Brodingo: .attr("checked", "checked") i think will work
21:33  bla: eTiger13, why should I use td instead of tr? With tr it's easier for me to find radio button inside and check it.
21:33  tesseracter: Brodingo, obviously, you'd need a uncheck too.
21:34  ajpiano: ?checkboxes
21:34  bot-t: To set a checkbox to checked, do .attr("checked","checked"). To uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked"). To check if it's checked or not: .is(":checked");

21:53  Swaagie: eTiger13: tables alright ;) but are jqGrid and Flexigrid the best choices currently?
21:53  vrtigo: seems to work there eTiger13, but not for me
21:54  eTiger13: burritoboy: http://jsfiddle.net/KBw4G/3/
21:55  eTiger13: burritoboy: oops missed one: http://jsfiddle.net/KBw4G/4/   and does it have to be a PUT?
21:55  eTiger13: Swaagie: from what i hear, yes. unless you go to extjs. or wait awhile for jqui to get grids
21:56  burritoboy: eTiger13: yes, it does, started as a post, and gave me issues because of my backend framework
21:56  Swaagie: jqui def. might be a good option when its developed, until then i'll settle with either of them, thanks :D
21:56  eTiger13: vrtigo: paste your full code or make your match that. did you see how i focused it first? otherwise cursor goes to beginning of the line
21:56  vrtigo: yea, i tried that too.. still doesnt really help
21:56  eTiger13: burritoboy: what kind of issues?
21:57  vrtigo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/524074/
21:57  burritoboy: eTiger13: well it isn't creating a resource, it is just updating one
21:57  eTiger13: vrtigo: how many textareas are in the #Comment element? and the text is being applied to it?
21:58  vrtigo: just one, and yes it is
21:58  vrtigo: the focus should be firing, but its not
21:58  gnarf: vrtigo: that .text() is being called on a DOM element
21:58  gnarf: doubt it would work
21:58  vrtigo: it certainly is
21:59  gnarf: $("#Comment textarea").val('@'+replyto+': ')[0].focus()
21:59  burritoboy: eTiger13: hmm, you're refactor is nice but it didn't fix the issue, success still not getting called, although the request completes with a status of 200
22:00  vrtigo: gnarf: its still not focusing
22:00  gnarf: http://www.jsfiddle.net/yLc4Z/
22:00  vrtigo: text is being applied tho
22:00  gnarf: it is there
22:00  gnarf: in firefox at least
22:00  vrtigo: it was also in eTiger13s example, but not here.
22:00  vrtigo: something fishy is happening.

22:02  eTiger13: vrtigo: live link then
22:02  vrtigo: it does

22:02  eTiger13: i love making buttons with css
22:02  gnarf: is there more than one textarea ? :)
22:02  eTiger13: just thought i would throw that out there

22:03  eTiger13: burritoboy: youre call is expecting json to be returned. that is most definitely not json
22:03  Fishy: Way to many people saying fishy
22:03  eTiger13: burritoboy: because of that your success is going to silently fail and thats why you are not seeing the alert
22:03  eTiger13: fishy
22:04  vrtigo: burritoboy: dataType: "json"
22:04  vrtigo: or, return a json content type in the response
22:04  vrtigo: otherwise its way too fishy
22:04  burritoboy: eTiger13 / vrtigo: aha! this has unfortunately bitten me before
22:05  eTiger13: burritoboy: change your dataType to text if you just want to one word the response
22:05  gnarf: {success:true}
22:05  burritoboy: eTiger13: yeah, the response doesn't really matter in this case, I'll do that
22:06  burritoboy: eTiger13, vrtigo, gnarf: thanks for the help :)
22:08  vrtigo: all good burritoboy

22:13  monstordh: ok
22:14  gkatsev: monstordh: changeSomething(); //assuming changeSomething is a function that changes something
22:14  monstordh: i have some content being pulled in by my CMS via Ajax. I can use jq to change it. but if there is any user interaction, the content is changed via Ajax and my jq mods are gone
22:14  monstordh: gkatsev: i'm just changing text
22:14  gkatsev: monstordh: just being literal, sorry.

22:14  monstordh: http://www.rippleeffect-designs.com/clients/elisabethscloset/

22:14  gkatsev: monstordh: you want to add what you want in a callback function
22:15  monstordh: see the green nav bar at the bottom?
22:15  monstordh: those links were originally numbers
22:15  monstordh: i want them to stay "as is" through user interaction
22:16  vrtigo: so you have a function which overwrites the numbers with labels?
22:16  vrtigo: and this isnt being called when you refresh the html?
22:16  monstordh: vrtigo: it's being called initially on the page load, but not after ajax refresh
22:17  monstordh: click on one of the links
22:17  vrtigo: so call it again, because the markup has changed
22:17  monstordh: vrtigo: how? that's what i'm asking
22:17  vrtigo: javascript isnt magical, despite evidence to the contrary
22:17  vrtigo: i dont know, whats the function that changes the numbers to labels?
22:18  monstordh: vrtigo: no clue. it's built into the cms
22:18  vrtigo: wow thats a lot of css
22:18  monstordh: y - bloated
22:18  Hopsy: any computer nerd here?
22:18  vrtigo: you have a $(document).ready function that sets the labels
22:19  monstordh: vrtigo: i guess i just need to know how to check if there has been any user interaction
22:19  gkatsev: Hopsy: aren't we all computer nerds in here?
22:19  monstordh: vrtigo: i mean, if the html has been refreshed via ajax
22:19  vrtigo: move the contents into a new function, function changeLabels()
22:19  vrtigo: and call that in the $(document).ready
22:19  vrtigo: fuck it

22:26  Joshua__: =(
22:26  vrtigo: 10:25:49) Joshua__: fail IE

22:27  vrtigo: just stop there
22:27  kanzie: anyone know hwere I can review current running buglist for latest jqueryUI, I found a error with dropdown not dropping down
22:28  Joshua__: Alright, I'll get back to you guys if I figure it out.
22:28  vrtigo: lol.
22:28  vrtigo: we are so much help
22:28  vrtigo: sorry
22:28  vrtigo: what is time_left supposed to represent?
22:28  vrtigo: a value, or a dom object?
22:33  Joshua__: It is just a div with an id of time_left.
22:33  Joshua__: Don't know much about the DOM tbh.
22:34  monstordh: vrtigo: no luck on the changeLabels. any ideas why it is not seeing the ajax action?
22:34  vrtigo: so do you want time_left to show if you alert it?
22:34  vrtigo: monstordh: nope. i have no idea how drupal does ajax
22:34  monstordh: vrtigo: ObKb. thanks anyway

22:35  AaronCicali: Is it possible to fire a callback after DOM content is injected from a call to .html() ??
22:35  monstordh: vrtigo: nope
22:35  eTiger13: AaronCicali: it happens instantly so you dont really need a callback. just do what you would do after it
22:36  eTiger13: Joshua__: its faster to not put div#id and just put #id
22:36  eTiger13: Joshua__:  and how do you know its failing in ie?
22:36  Joshua__: vrtigo: http://anagramscramble.appspot.com/word/?level=3 to see where I'm at.
22:36  Joshua__: It pops up saying there is an error.
22:36  Joshua__: And the countdown doesn't work.
22:37  AaronCicali: eTiger13: but I'm injecting a lot of DOM content, and really need to show a loading indicator
22:37  AaronCicali: :(
22:37  rhizmoe: that was weird
22:39  vrtigo: Joshua__: for starters, put all of your javascript inside a $(function() { ... }); block
22:39  vrtigo: so that jquery might have a chance to load first
22:39  vrtigo: oh you have one
22:39  Joshua__: I did that in the dev enviornment haven't pushed the change though.
22:39  vrtigo: already
22:39  Joshua__: Didn't fix it.
22:39  vrtigo: whats the issue anyway?
22:39  vrtigo: i dont know what its supposed to do
22:39  Joshua__: In IE that counter, if you see the counter, isn't going down.
22:40  Joshua__: I'm getting an error on line 21, even when its contained with the div, saying that method is isn't supported.
22:40  Joshua__: contained with the ready function rather
22:40  vrtigo: use time_left.text() instead of html()
22:41  Joshua__: Change didn't switch the error.
22:42  Joshua__: I'm pretty new at this btw, still learning.
22:42  vrtigo: no, but its more correct
22:43  vrtigo: can you paste your dev javascript into http://paste.ubuntu.com/
22:44  Joshua__: http://paste.ubuntu.com/524098/
22:44  vrtigo: you havent moved your two functions inside the ready function
22:44  vrtigo: also
22:44  vrtigo: change $().ready(function() { to $(function() {
22:45  Joshua__: What is the difference?
22:46  Joshua__: Oh. I didn't know they should be inside of it.
22:46  vrtigo: just to be safe really
22:46  vrtigo: it is IE we are talking about

22:48  rhizmoe: can a jquery dropdown be sized to use scrollbars or maybe even to be maclike?
22:48  eTiger13: ?p @ AaronCicali
22:48  bot-t: AaronCicali, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
22:49  rhizmoe: maclike meaning that it scrolls the selection
22:49  eTiger13: rhizmoe: why not use a regular select at that point?
22:49  rhizmoe: it's a jquery autocomplete. this guy: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
22:50  rhizmoe: so, autocomplete with dropdown, but the jq dropdown can get buried by the bottom of the browser

23:00  rmurphey: yeah the whole grade-able thing is probably ambitious :)
23:00  paul_irish: yup
23:00  rmurphey: and i think i tend to approach this from the perspective of "do you know what's wrong with this code?"
23:01  rmurphey: more than "can you write something that will do x"
23:01  jhilla: Ah, yes.
23:01  zackattack: what is $(that), $(this), and this. ?
23:01  AaronCicali: Sorry eTiger13: AFK.... aaroncicali.com/jquery-plugins/grid
23:01  zackattack: this refers to the current context/scope.
23:01  zackattack: i don't know about $(that) and $(this)
23:01  paul_irish: jquery wrapped around those elements
23:01  paul_irish: oftentimes jquery sets the context to be a DOM element
23:01  AaronCicali: I'm writing a grid that caches, but the cached pages need a loading indicator as well
23:01  paul_irish: and often you store that element as var that;.. so that you can change the context again
23:02  zackattack: oh i see, thanks paul
23:02  revolveweb: ugh, ive come across an async issue i cant remember how to get around.... im doing a .post and within the return function I want to set a css background depending on the data response. however I *think* because it is async the data isnt available yet? is that right? how do I get around it?

23:03  paul_irish: ah
23:03  paul_irish: cool excercise.
23:03  jhilla: We just use it as a way to guage the quality and stricture of code they come back with.
23:03  rmurphey: yeah that is probably a pretty good filter
23:03  paul_irish: i hate image sliders :)
23:03  rmurphey: heh

23:03  jhilla: So far the two people we've given it two didn't even try to get it to look like the PSD.

23:04  rmurphey: jhilla: did they offer any rationale?

23:04  rmurphey: nice
23:04  rmurphey: jhilla: you have seen my gist?
23:05  jhilla: Not really. The one who admitted to the stealing said he didn't have time for it and was getting paid elsewear.

23:08  paul_irish: AaronCicali: its a synchromous method.
23:08  OhaiBBQ: i used to love c# until i learned javascript ;)
23:09  AaronCicali: sure, but what are users supposed to look at for the full second of DOM injecting ?
23:09  revolveweb: ah nm i found out how to do it, if i do var blaa = $(this); then i can call blaa.whatever
23:09  paul_irish: yup
23:09  paul_irish: revolveweb: its common to use `that` as a name
23:10  paul_irish: put in a loading indicator before. and take it out after
23:10  Hoe``: I need to make a list of jQuery objects inside of a loop. I assume I'd use .add() for this, but what do I initially declare the variable as? var foo = ??????; for (...) { foo.add(getItem()); }

23:22  AaronCicali: the hide() happens immediately... it's possible that the wait time I'm experiencing is from rendering now that I think about it

I want to have an element that hte user can click to turn on (or off) the highlighting.  So, I'd like to modify the CSS property itself--rather than each highlighted bit of text.  So I disable backgorund-color, in CSS, or enable--on demand.
23:27  eTiger13: AaronCicali: is that how you are doing it? with .html? where is the content coming from?
23:27  jhilla: There's just so many nuances with JS that I want to learn more about.
23:27  twittard: This doesn't seem to be an easy thing to google for, so I'm wondering if I'm asking for pain
23:28  rhizmoe: twittard: make a 'highlight' class that you toggle
23:29  eTiger13: twittard: you are. i would think you have to wrap all the text you want to be highlightable in a span and then give those spans a class and then on click add a class to those spans of highlighted or something that has some css with a background color and on second click remove that span

23:30  twittard: argh
23:30  Adman65: paul_irish: besides textboxlist
23:31  OhaiBBQ: or ?toggleClass @ twittard
23:31  OhaiBBQ: ?togglelClass @ twittard
23:31  rhizmoe: i'd imagine you could tell solr to use a custom tag
23:31  bot-t: OhaiBBQ, Couldn't find "togglelClass" in jQuery Docs.
23:31  twittard: OhaiBBQ: Sweeet, thank you
23:31  jeffszusz: twittard: toggle between "highlight_on" and "highlight_off" classes in the container element
23:31  jeffszusz: so like
23:31  jerome187: anyone know how to get external interface working with swf object?
23:31  eTiger13: Adman65: you mean like the jqueryui autocomplete?
23:31  jeffszusz: #results.highlight_on strong {...}
23:32  Adman65: eTiger13: ya
23:32  jeffszusz: #results.highlight_off strong {...}
23:32  eTiger13: Adman65: ok then i suggest the jqueryui autocomplete
23:32  twittard: jeffszusz: How do I tell it to toggle?  Is there a simple command?
23:32  eTiger13: ?toggleclass @ twittard
23:33  bot-t: twittard, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
23:33  jeffszusz: you'll have to use JS
23:33  twittard: thank you
23:34  eTiger13: bot-t: tell OhaiBBQ spellcheck is your friend. look for the squigglies!
23:34  bot-t: eTiger13, Okay.
23:34  OhaiBBQ: bot-t: tell eTiger13 i figured i'd give up and try not to be so spammy after 2 tries
23:34  bot-t: (39 secs ago) <eTiger13> tell OhaiBBQ spellcheck is your friend. look for the squigglies!
23:34  bot-t: OhaiBBQ, Okay.
23:35  jeffszusz: twittard: just make sure you put the toggled class on the container element, not on the strong element
23:35  twittard: ok, thank you
23:35  jeffszusz: toggling it in one place is much more efficient than toggling it a hundred times on one page.
23:36  eTiger13: OhaiBBQ: its always the kids that get caught in the middle, in this case, poor bott
23:36  bot-t: (2 mins 4 secs ago) <OhaiBBQ> tell eTiger13 i figured i'd give up and try not to be so spammy after 2 tries
23:37  hwk2|1: got this code:
23:37  hwk2|1: http://pastebin.com/BaTF3ceg
23:37  hwk2|1: but it executes by itself when the page loads
23:37  hwk2|1: :|
23:38  hwk2|1: how can i fix this?
23:38  bakers: hwk2|1: You need to pass click a function reference, not a real function
23:38  eTiger13: $("#morebutt").click(get_videos);
23:38  hwk2|1: ouh
23:38  hwk2|1: :|
23:38  bakers: hwk2|1: or click(function() { get_videos(); })
23:38  hwk2|1: $("#morebutt").click(get_videos); using this example
23:39  bakers: hwk2|1: passing .click(foo()) passes click the OUTPUT of foo() not the actual function itself
23:39  hwk2|1: how can i parse args to the function?
23:39  eTiger13: hwk2|1: and that click line should be wrapped in a doc ready function
23:39  bakers: hwk2|1: do .click(function() { get_videos(1,'a',3,'b'); })
23:39  hwk2|1: okey
23:39  hwk2|1: :)€
23:39  hwk2|1: thanks a bunch :X
23:40  hwk2|1: cna i use document ready inside body ?
23:40  eTiger13: hwk2|1: you can use it almost where ever you want
23:40  bakers: hwk2|1: Inside body? doc.ready has to be in a script tag
23:41  hwk2|1: <body><script>doc read</script></body>
23:41  hwk2|1: this is what i mean
23:41  bakers: hwk2|1: Anywhere script is valid you can put a document.ready({function() })
23:41  bakers: hwk2|1: inside body is valid
23:41  hwk2|1: thanks
23:42  OhaiBBQ: poor bot-t :(
23:43  jerome187: this sucks
23:43  eTiger13: jerome187: yeah it does
23:44  eTiger13: rmurphey: you still around?
23:44  rmurphey: i am!
23:46  eTiger13: rmurphey: on the trackpad (played with one for a little bit while at the apple store buying the misses an ipod nano) how hard is it to right click?
23:46  rmurphey: you can set it up to do so by two-tapping
23:46  rmurphey: or i think also any given corner
23:46  rmurphey: same as the mbp trackpad, basically
23:48  jerome187: so... external interface.  does the plugin work?  does it expect the id of the swf object itself or the div that contains the swf object?  cause when you use swf object plugin to add a swf, it puts it in there and gives it its own id....
23:49  jerome187: toiling in the acid mines...
