08:43  tprice: well you can call template a name space really all my code is in different modules
08:44 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 107 seconds
08:45  danheberden: i'd be worried you're getting all kinds of persistant objects that the garbage collector isn't able to, well, collect
08:46  tprice: danheberden: have not started to think about that yet
08:47  tprice: im still getting the app to proto version
08:47  danheberden: is there like a specific problem you're encountering?
08:47  danheberden: maybe i missed the punch line
08:48  tprice: im ending up with 50 or 60 click events
08:48  tprice: trying to keep track of them is growing out of control
08:49  danheberden: like your click handler is firing 50-60 times when you click once?
08:49  tprice:  no i have  50-60  click handlers
08:50  tprice: here is a small section of code to give you an idea http://pastebin.com/8VfpUnxu
08:50  danheberden: tprice: might be better to break that up
08:50  danheberden: like, delegate to higher objects
08:50  danheberden: and have 1-5 event handlers
08:51  danheberden: tprice: if you leverage caching and perhaps roll your own delegation
08:52  danheberden: hard to suggest more with the small snippet
08:52  ajpiano: something about that doesn't make me feel really....organised
08:53  tprice: would you like to see template object?
08:53  danheberden: definitely wont hurt :p
08:53  ajpiano: like, if you have that structure where the element id maps directly to the rpc call name in most cases
08:53  ajpiano: you could write one function for all four things
08:53  danheberden: and just check the elements id
08:54  danheberden: saving element lookups
08:54  tprice: just give me a line number and ill tell you about it http://pastebin.com/zw5rF4fz
08:55  tprice: im thinking of putting together maybe a few jquery plugin to deal with my clcks
08:55  doonie: why doesn't google closure or yui compressor work on jquery themeswitcher ;(
08:56  ajpiano: you know there is like,  a jquery templating plugin, right
08:56  tprice: dont like it
08:56  ajpiano: why
08:56  ajpiano: you know there are other templating solutions out there as well
08:56  danheberden: or mustache?
08:57  danheberden: $.tmpl is sexy
08:57  tprice: ive looked at pure and closure library aswell as .tmpl
08:57  tprice: did feel they where what i was looking for
08:58  danheberden: tprice: things like your genirateKey function
08:58  danheberden: there's faster ways to do that kinda thing
08:58  ajpiano: it just seems kind of baffling that there is no existing templating solution out there that you feel is better than manually concatting a lot of strings together
08:58  danheberden: plus, generating an id isn't quite the best solution to tracking items
08:58  danheberden: tprice: i dont mean this in a bad way, but i think maybe those libraries dont fit your needs is because you might have a very particular way of doing it
08:59  danheberden: like.. you want to remove the transmission from the top of the car
08:59  danheberden: but instead, it'd be WAY easier to remove it from teh bottom
08:59  danheberden: and it might take trying it that way to see that 'oh, yeah, this is way better and awesome 'n shit'
09:00  tprice: ajpiano: i do like pure its a good library
09:00  liam: is it possible to loop through some elements and add their values to a json array?
09:01  tprice: danheberden: i like coding logic but right now the template object it the weak link in my app
09:01  ajpiano: what is a "json array"
09:02  liam: ajpiano: I mean like this http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
09:02  ajpiano: sooooo
09:02  tprice: liam do a for in loop and jsonArray.push()
09:02  ajpiano: why would you be pushing into a stringified tranport format
09:02  ajpiano: you mean a....javascript arry
09:03  tprice: or just array
09:03  ajpiano: liam: you shoudl also look into the map metod
09:03  ajpiano: ?g when to use jquery's map methods @ liam
09:03  bot-t: liam, When To Use jQuery's .map Methods - http://ajpiano.com/2010/when-to-use-jquerys-map-methods/
09:04  danheberden: tprice: a quick tip
09:04  ajpiano: also, using the jquery-json plugin is kind of pointless btw
09:04  danheberden: array joining is faster than string concatenation
09:04  ajpiano: ^^
09:04  danheberden: so like the getEmpt function
09:04  liam: ajpiano: very nice. Thank you.
09:04  danheberden: better to make those keys of an array and .join('')
09:04  champion_: hey guys.....does anyone know the jquery galleria before?
09:05  crab: it's too bad the jquery autocomplete plugin didn't take a json object rather than an array by default
09:05  tprice: danheberden: thats a good point
09:05  danheberden: champion_: i've used it, but i dont think it's an entity to know
09:05  liam: ajpiano: so when you say $(".poo").map does that mean it loops through all elements with the class poo ??
09:05  danheberden: crab: how would that work?
09:05  ss23: lol poo
09:05  ajpiano: liam, yup
09:05  danheberden: like, its just searching a list, ya?
09:05  liam: ajpiano: ok cool
09:06  danheberden: crab: or ya thinking like search the keys so you have a crap load of whaver data you want?
09:06  champion_: danheberden, would you mind help me?
09:06  crab: danheberden: just { "items": [...what you sent before...] } or so, to defeat <script>-based hijacking.
09:06  danheberden: champion_: you got 644 people anxiously awaiting your questions :)
09:07  champion_: oh just one things....plz
09:07  tprice: danheberden: do you know of any apps on git that i could look at to get an idea of the ebst way to do my html?

09:08  danheberden: its pretty easy to read

09:12  danheberden: tprice: and it's that ahha moment that both blows and will pave the way for future "ZOMG THIS FUCKING ROCKS" moments
09:12  crab: ...or maybe i should just stop worrying about it.
09:13  tprice: danheberden: right now i dont see it
09:13  tprice: but..
09:13  JKarsrud: Aww, crap. That OOCSS article has a serious flaw in it
09:13  tprice: god damit
09:13  danheberden: JKarsrud: for reals?
09:13  JKarsrud: this selector sucks: .pop-out > section > *
09:13  danheberden: tprice: i used to do clone based templating
09:13  JKarsrud: Like wtf
09:13  danheberden: i hear ya budy

09:14  danheberden: JKarsrud: while that's valid, it looks cary
09:14  danheberden: *scary
09:14  champion_: bot-t can i paste it here?
09:14  JKarsrud: select ALL FUCKING ELEMENTS, then ALL FUCKING ELEMENTS that are a direct child of a section, then ALL FUCKING SECTIONS that are a direct child of .pop-out
09:14  JKarsrud: Slow as hell, dammit
09:14  danheberden: JKarsrud: lol
09:14  danheberden: chuckling for reals
09:15  bot-t: yes my child
09:15  Nomikos: o_O
09:15  danheberden: champion_: you rlINK
09:15  danheberden: *LINK
09:15  danheberden: not the code
09:15  tprice: danheberden: i started out with cloning but moved away from it
09:15  bot-t: paste your jsfiddle link to me
09:15  champion_: ok then......http://paste.pocoo.org/show/304202/
09:15  bot-t: mmm i love me some links
09:15  Nomikos: What is this cloning you speak of?
09:16  danheberden: tprice: good :)
09:16  danheberden: cloning elements then modifying them.. its like the worst slowest awfullest way you can template
09:16  JKarsrud: danheberden: haha, that was sorta the point :) But that selector is just plain crazy and slow
09:16  Nomikos: danheberden: as in, dynamically?
09:16  JKarsrud: Clearly people don't know that CSS is parsed ltr
09:17  danheberden: JKarsrud: it was SO worth it for your explanation
09:17  champion_: bot-t did you get my link?
09:17  JKarsrud: Haha
09:17  danheberden: JKarsrud: though they've improved css implenation to not be so gnarly on rtl
09:17  tprice: danheberden: have you heard of cloud9 the ide?
09:17  danheberden: though i need to redo that peft test
09:17  danheberden: *peft test
09:17  danheberden: GODDAMNIT
09:18  danheberden: tprice: nup
09:18  JKarsrud: true enough, but still. It will select ALL FUCKING ELEMENTS first :P
09:18  danheberden: Nomikos: ya
09:18  danheberden: JKarsrud: lol you are PASSIONATE!
09:18  danheberden: i like it!
09:18  JKarsrud: champion_: bot-t is a bot, it can't read your code :)
09:18  JKarsrud: hahahahaha
09:18  JKarsrud: why thank you ;)
09:19  danheberden: so, uh champion_ ? where do you actually setup the gallery?
09:19  sone: for jqGrid if I set a field to  editable:true is that all is needed to make it work or am missing something else?
09:19  Nomikos: To be fair, bot-t is a bot that is sometimes steered along a little, it could probably beat a Turing test :)
09:20  bot-t: watch your tongue, boy!
09:20  JKarsrud: Nomikos: Haha, yeah :)
09:20  champion_: dan, what do u mean where do i actually setup the gallery?
09:20  danheberden: champion_: well, you have that pretty div and li structure
09:21  danheberden: but i don't see anywhere where the plugin galleria is implemented
09:21  tprice: danheberden: what about the rutorrent app
09:21  danheberden: uh, is that for torrents?
09:22  c0mpub0mb: danheberden: got that code working, https://github.com/compubomb/simpleajaxupload
09:22  tprice: yeah buts its a really nice (kinda heavy) script app
09:22  tprice: javascript**
09:22  c0mpub0mb: not quite an ajax call, but it mimics.. it's pretty simple plugin..
09:22  c0mpub0mb: going to improve it some more.
09:22  danheberden: cool man
09:22  danheberden: glad to see ya got some progress :)
09:23  champion_: yeah i have already plugin galleria
09:23  danheberden: champion_: you included it
09:23  danheberden: but i don't see anywhere where you have it actually called
09:23  c0mpub0mb: danheberden: <-- jquery genius :p (!)

10:20  Nomikos: Yep
10:21  Rovanion: Nomikos: How?
10:22  Nomikos: Rovanion: if you run a function that starts both animations, they'll both start pretty much at the same time. They don't have to wait for eachother to finish.

10:38  coldhead: ningia: can you put it on the query string?

10:43  Rovanion: Nomikos: Nope that didn't work. I'm running $('.X').click(function() {	close('.hidden'); open(name);}  where close() and open() are animations for 1s. They are done sequentially and not parallel
10:44  ningia: coldboot: uhm... I haven't that parameter server side... :(
10:44  matt1982: hmm if jquery doesn't even do the basic:  $(document).ready(function() { alert("hello"); } any ideas where to start debugging. It works in Opera weirdly but IE and FF not a sausage.
10:44  klawd: hi!
10:45  klawd: can i pass arguments to a mouseover event somehow?
10:45  Nomikos: Rovanion: huh, odd, maybe I misremembered.. can you pastebin that?

10:46  coldhead: ningia: can you add that parameter server side?
10:46  matt1982: coldhead, yes two secs. I also checked HTTP headers and saw that it was querying google for the jquery
10:47 @nlogax: klawd: yes, in a number of ways. one is something like function myHandler(extra, args) { return function(event) { do something with extra args and/or event } }; thing.click(myHandler(1, "lol"))

10:59  matt1982: yeah me too coldhead sucks :( esp for a monday morning hah. Ohh well guess I will have to keep testing it.
10:59 @temp01: internal drupal stuff relies on the old version or something
10:59  danheberden: onto, if you can get 1.3.2 then you have live
10:59  matt1982: thanks for taking a look though coldhead
10:59  onto: danheberden, yes, I'll install jquery update then and see if I run into any trouble ... if not I'll use livequery

11:05 @danheberden: but be sure to ask questions first
11:05  eboyjr: danheberden: So foo.children().eq(position) should work?
11:05  rainabba: I just informed him and told him to reconsider the links w/o related questions.

11:07  eboyjr: it works :p

11:13  Echoes: hi guys, can someone take a look at this simple email regexp check and see if that can see what's wrong please? http://javascript.pastebin.com/106ekUEP
11:13  eighty4: any known bug related to animate and marginLeft where it doesn't handle to big "offsets"? when I'm going from margin-left: -10000ish px fo -11000 it seems to reset and do the animation from 0 to -11000 instead.
11:13  rainabba: pallet: Told ya. You not see my message (and warning) in #css?
11:14  pallet: yeh
11:14  pallet: danheberden unbanned me

11:16  Nomikos: Everytime I see "email regex" I have to think of http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
11:17  jaredquinn: Nomikos: a friend of mine has the regex that meets RFC822 printed on a t-shirt... in a tiny font it covers most of the shirt
11:17  Nomikos: :-)

11:20  coldhead: aw danheberden
11:20  coldhead: what a sweetheart
11:20 @danheberden: lol
11:22  rainabba: Will I get a log of crap for asking CSS questions here (despite all the knowledge I know is in here)?
11:22  rainabba: s/log/lot/
11:22  rainabba: It's an interesting question :)
11:22  coldhead: ?tias @ rainabba
11:22  bot-t: rainabba, Try It And See
11:22  coldhead: i guess expect some crap but it depends what else is going on
11:22  rainabba: Hehe. Not sure about that advise when we have a ban-happy bot around :)
11:22  rainabba: Ok, got one for you guys. I've got a handful of small tables (thanks to asp.net auto-gen code) and in a very patterned way, they're all horizontal as you'd expect td's to be when viewed in IE, but in Chrome, the first set of td in a tr are horizontal and the rest in the same div are vertical as if it was a set of tr's with one td each. How could that even be done?
11:23  rainabba: I can use jQuery to test fixes and causes ;)
11:23  Nomikos: .. pastebin?
11:23 * rainabba hopes that covers his butt by making the question relevant to jQuery.
11:23  coldhead: rainabba: is there some weirdness going on with display: for the TDs?
11:24  coldhead: display:table-cell etc?
11:24  coldhead: those things creep me out
11:24  Nomikos: If it's auto-generated code, chances are <tr>s or <td>s are not closed, never mind about tbody etc
11:24  coldhead: you'd wanna experiment with firebug or equivalent
11:24  rainabba: Nomikos: Wish I could and I know you don't want to hear that, but it's an Intranet app that would likely take me 20 minutes to replicate in a static manner and to strip private stuff.
11:25  coldhead: yeah validating is a good idea, well spotted Nomikos
11:25  rainabba: coldhead: That was my first thought so I glanced, but I'll dig deeper since you're confirming my suspision.
11:25  rainabba: Nomikos: Actually, asp.net is pretty good about xhtml if you tell it to be, but you may be right. I'll check that too.
11:26  Nomikos: rainabba: ah ok, understood - but it *is* hard to say what is going on without seeing source.. it doesn't sound like a common issue that has obvious causes
11:26  Nomikos: and yeah, element inspector might point at reasons
11:27  Echoes: Nomikos: ty
11:27  rainabba: Nomikos: I know :(  I always hate that question because it's always a problem with my work and makes my life hell at times. I've had projects where I couldn't even google to research while I was developing. Thankfully this is far less restrictive, but not without restrictions.
11:28  rainabba: Nomikos: Element Inspector aka "Inspect Element" in chrome or FF?
11:28  rainabba: Not a web-based tool right?
11:28  Nomikos: rainabba: both?
11:28  Nomikos: Chrome has it native, Firefox has Firebug
11:28  eighty4: http://jsfiddle.net/R6WfC/ <-- Click "Click here to move the div" a couple of times. The first times it works as it should. But when the margin becomes greater than -11000px it just stopes working. Anyone know why?
11:29  Nomikos: rainabba: no, they're both local (once installed, for Firebug)
11:30  ningia: coldboot: yeah, it functions...
11:30  rainabba: Nomikos: rgr
11:31  rainabba: Nomikos: Ahh. "Both". By "web-based tool" I meant something like one of the copy/paste validation sites :)
11:31  Nomikos: (And Firebug on FF/OS X can be a righteous buggy PITA)
11:32  Nomikos: rainabba: oh, yeah I meant you can use both to inspect elements somehow :)
11:32  Nomikos: both browsers
11:32  rainabba: :)
11:33  rainabba: Chrome dev tools are a LOT like firebug actually.
11:33  rainabba: Undocked.
11:33  Nomikos: I've been awake for close to 24 hours so my way of expressing can get a bit flutzpah
11:35  rainabba: I know the feeling. It's 3:30AM here and I'm crunching to get a few last things done before I can push at a beta to be testing by my client around noon.
11:36  mkc: Yea lol. I had 4 hours of sleep and it is back to work. = (
11:36  mkc: the only comfort is that i get to work from bed
11:38  rainabba: Nice. I work from home, but I'm not sure that's better than being in an office some times. My wife and baby boy are in a king size Tempurpedic 25 feet away and that's taunting right about now :)
11:40  Nomikos: ha
11:40  Nomikos: rainabba: are you freelance?
11:41  rainabba: No, just have a really sweet gig (in that sense anyway). Wish I had time for side-work but for at least another 1.5 years I'm spending every working minute on this project to try and make it something special. If it doesn't do well enough, I'm going elsewhere at that point :)
11:42  crab: what is a tempurpedic?
11:42  Nomikos: I've worked from home for years when I didn't have a job (= office), but this last year I've rented a small space at walking distance from home
11:42  Nomikos: and it makes a world of difference :)

12:00  beont: what should i do
12:00  beont: ?
12:00  rainabba: Force-refresh is also completely unreliable.

12:04  beont: ok
12:05  Cork: btw what version of jquery?
12:06  beont: 1 4 4
12:06  beont: min
12:06  Cork: might be worth loading an uncompressed version
12:06  beont: hmmm

12:07  beont: i can not use

12:08  Cork: sure
12:08  Cork: (donno if it provides a way to load jquery uncompressed though)
12:09  beont: i ll try the uncompressed version

12:54  iszak: .is(':visible') ?
12:54  iszak: .is(':hidden') perhaps
12:55 * AlexC_ wonders if this thing is on
12:55  pumpit_: iszak how to refrsh the parent window once the lyte box is closed
12:55  iszak: I'm not familiar with lyte box
12:56  iszak: by the looks of it, you can't.
12:56  AlexC_: $("div", category).data("foo", "bar"); does not add in the attribute, why is this?
12:56  iszak: Look at fancybox.
12:56  iszak: AlexC_, data stores the data internally, not on the element.
12:57  iszak: perhaps you want .attr('data-foo', 'bar')
12:57  AlexC_: iszak: no it doesn't
12:57  iszak: it used to
12:57  iszak: ?source
12:57  bot-t: jQuery 1.4 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.js
12:58  AlexC_: iszak: either way, something as similar as addClass("foo") does not add the class on either
12:58  pumpit_: guys help me in lyte box
12:58  iszak: AlexC_, seems it does ?
12:58  iszak: pumpit_, use fancybox.
12:59  pumpit_: ok ill chk
12:59  iszak: trust me - much better.
12:59  iszak: AlexC_, check the sauce, it uses jQuery.cache to store it.
13:00  jpic: how to expose an internal variable or function from a plugin?
13:00  AlexC_: iszak: sure however that doesn't resolve the issue of it not adding anything, even a simple 'addClass' or 'attr'
13:00  iszak: what is category?
13:00  iszak: give me a live code
13:00  JKarsrud: jpic: Put in in the namespace of the plugin? $.fn.pluginName.variable = "something" ?
13:01  iszak: the chances are AlexC_ is that it can't find any divs inside the category, probably because category variable is wrong.
13:01  AlexC_: iszak: http://paste2.org/p/1139718
13:01  jpic: JKarsrud: great, thanks
13:01  edbaffei: whats the opposite of append?
13:01  JKarsrud: remove?
13:02  JKarsrud: or do you mean prepend?
13:02  edbaffei: thnx
13:02  jpic: JKarsrud: pop
13:02  iszak: AlexC_, you're looking for div's with class category inside of the div that is with that class.
13:02  JKarsrud: jpic?
13:02  edbaffei: dont know.. am using toggle.. to append, and would like to undo
13:02  AlexC_: iszak: ok, makes sense. How do I acomplish what I'm after?
13:02  iszak: what are you after? appending the data to div.category?
13:03  AlexC_: iszak: yes
13:03  JKarsrud: edbaffei: Okay, then you want to remove the element, right?
13:03  iszak: AlexC_, category.data(...)
13:03  JKarsrud: But why not append it, and then hide() it?
13:03  JKarsrud: And then just show it?
13:03  JKarsrud: Instead of appending and removing it all the time
13:03  AlexC_: iszak: a ha, ok. Thanks :)
13:04  AlexC_: why doesn't it add the attrs in though? Seems quite strange
13:04  edbaffei: Jkarsrud: thnx
13:04  AlexC_: it works, and I understand why it works, but not why it's done like that
13:05  iszak: AlexC_, $('selector', context)
13:05  rainabba: What's the effective difference between setting a radio buttons checked attribute to checked, and firing it's click even directly (do both not result in the same thing)?
13:05  iszak: it's the same as context.find('selector') not context.filter('selector') implying context is a jquery object.
13:05  AlexC_: iszak: no, I mean why doesn't .data() add the attributes
13:05  iszak: because it's easier the other way.
13:06  iszak: i don't know why tbh.

13:55  iszak: But as rmurphey suggested The_Miso you should atleast understand how it works.
13:55  iszak: Come to #regex if you want to know.
13:55  The_Miso: I do, I'm just very bad at it
13:55  iszak: it's easy.

13:56  The_Miso: So I didn't know the correct syntax.
13:56  The_Miso: Of course, googling was an option, and I tried. Maybe I got a little lazy, being at work for 20 straight hours now.

14:07  deadowl: Great, my password on a website was compromised and I don't remember what the password was :(
14:08  rainabba: Unless it was a really shitty site you should be able to do a password reset via email. Any decent site requires email acces to change the PW so people can't permanently hijack your accounts.
14:09 * lbr thinks deadowl is using that same passwords on any number of sites
14:09  deadowl: rainabba, I would rather know the current password so I know whether it's one of my weaker ones or stronger ones.
14:09  deadowl: hopefully a weaker one.

14:13 * lbr primarily uses linux, so can't really use it, but hears good things
14:16  deadowl: okay, I have devised a new password scheme where part of the password is derived from the context of the site, and the other part is the same.
14:16  lanmower: hi guys, any advice as to why I cant nest accordions successfully?
14:18  rainabba: deadowl: And you wonder why your password was compromised?
14:18  deadowl: rainabba, because Gawker was hacked.
14:18  deadowl: I definitely use different passwords
14:19  deadowl: and they're definitely not human readable.
14:19  rainabba: Discussing your passwords publically can't help. Maybe they compromised the site through your account? :)
14:19  deadowl: doubt it
14:19 * rainabba is ready to shoot himself in the head.
14:20  rainabba: Finally got this page to the point where I expect things to work, and now I'm getting "Out of Stack Space" and "too much recursion" errors from a click() handler I bound.
14:20 * lbr also got a mail from hint.lo
14:21  lanmower: when I put an accordion inside an accordion, only the inner one on the first header works.
14:21  rainabba: I wonder.... I bound a click handler to a <td> then I'm calling .click() on an <input> element that's a child of the <td>. Could it be bubbling up?
14:22  deadowl: too much recursion error on something like domattrchanged is really easy to do.
14:23  deadowl: but yea, rainabba, sounds like it
14:30  lanmower1: http://jsfiddle.net/bL7ys/
14:31  lanmower1: can someone please tell me how I can get the second third and fouth sub-accordions working?
14:32  rainabba: Damn. I don't even know where to start with this. I tried "return false;" at the end of my anonymous function in the bound handler for the click event, but that made no difference. I don't even know where the loop is or what's causing it. Any suggestions?
14:33  Clorith: I'm having some odd color variations on my jqueryui buttons/items, it's not sizing up like they should ( like this; http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/5041/oddity.png ) has anyone experienced somethign similar?
14:34  Clorith: I haven't touched the jqueryui css
14:34  Clorith: It was supposed to use the disk icon, which is the icon that wasn't cut off
14:35  pingo_: Clorith, it depends on your exisiting styles
14:35  pingo_: look in firebug to see what's ovveriding
14:36  Clorith: oh good point, forgot about that feature :D
14:36  pingo_: *override
14:36  Clorith: I've gotten so accustomed to using chrome and it's javascript debugger
14:37  lbr: now debug it in IE
14:38  Clorith: I'm gonna go with "no" :P
14:38  Clorith: it actualyl works in everything I've made, it's only the color oddity being consistent on all browsers so far =)
14:38  rainabba: Chrome will let you see overridden style (in case you were thinking otherwise).
14:40  Clorith: I haven't used anythign other then the js console on chrome, so I wouldn't know
14:40  Clorith: only one inherit that affects it, and that's ui-tabs with it's font color
14:41  Clorith: could my use of margings or width: and position: fixed be affecting it in any way?
14:43  rainabba: I'm dealing with an element that already has onClick defined thanks to asp.net and I just want to fire that off. How would I do that?
14:43  Drule: Hi.

14:47  rainabba: Clorith: "not adding my own" doesn't address "how to fire existing code".
14:47  Drule: As well as switching the sidebar for another DIV.
14:47  Drule: Are there any tutorials or plugins on this that don't require programming knowledge
14:47  rainabba: If I call click() it bubbles up and causes recursion and I don't really need to emulate a click, I need to execute the code that's already defined for a click.

15:09  rainabba: "Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example"  <-- If it's not, then that's likely my problem :)  Care to help? I figure it's a simple syntax/reference issue. I've not used the event namespace before.
15:10  webben: rainabba: "event" isn't a namespace, it's just a variable.
15:10  webben: rainabba: You have to bind it to an actual JQuery wrapped event object for that API to be available.
15:11  rainabba: Hmm.
15:11  rainabba: ahh
15:12  nils_r: is there something lik $.var like there is $.fn?
15:12  rainabba: webben: In that case... $(this).find('input:radio').click(function (event) {
15:12  rainabba:                     event.stopPropogation();
15:12  rainabba:                 });

15:20  asdf2345: hello
15:20  asdf2345: how would i do something after an event is triggered?
15:21  webben: asdf2345: ? bind a listener to the event
15:21  webben: asdf2345: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
15:21  asdf2345: well i added the mousewheel extension but it seems to react then the change inquestion happens
15:22  webben: asdf2345: Got a http://sscce.org/ ?
15:22  AlexC_: I'm adding a new 'category' via AJAX, and when it is successful I want to add HTML to the DOM, however where is the best place to store such HTML? Initial a category wont exist, so I have nothing to copy/clone within the DOM. Is it bad to put it into JavaScript?
15:22  asdf2345: e.g. .val() of a select is the initial value before the mousewheel event is detected then my altert pops then the change occurs in the value
15:22  AlexC_: or is it best to put a dummy set of HTML in, and just keep it hidden and copy that?
15:23  webben: AlexC_: I think it's best (atm) to keep it out of the initial DOM.
15:23  AlexC_: webben: and create it via JS?
15:24  webben: AlexC_: Since that's got greater compatibility that proposed mechanisms of demarking parts of the DOM as inactive.
15:24  webben: *than proposed
15:24  webben: AlexC_: As for "create it via JS", well, maybe - depends what that means.
15:24  webben: AlexC_: e.g. you could have a template in a JS literal into which you substitute text with DOM methods/string methods.
15:25  webben: AlexC_: You could by adding a category via  webservice and get back some updated HTML to insert into your DOM.
15:25  asdf2345: hmm
15:25  webben: AlexC_: You could just build the HTML node by node with DOM methods.
15:25  asdf2345: i do not have an example to display
15:25  webben: asdf2345: Make one. :)
15:26  asdf2345: ok
15:26  webben: AlexC_: Any of those methods could be combined with having a blob of DOM you clone whenever you add a ceategory.
15:26  rainabba: If I want to prepend the innerHTML of an element with more HTML, what function would I use on the target element?
15:26  AlexC_: webben: I just get JSON back currently, of which I am building the HTML with, which is ok - but A) I'm duplicating code, if I do changes in the main view file I also have to do it in the JS file B) its messy to format (code wise)
15:27  webben: rainabba: .prepend('<html goes here>')
15:27  rainabba: Of course :)
15:28  webben: AlexC_: Re code duplication: returning HTML snippets, or using JS serverside, or using an HTML string template would all avoid that.
15:28  webben: AlexC_: Re "messy to format" ... not sure what you mean.
15:29  AlexC_: hum, I guess. Ok I'll see what I can come up with - thanks
15:32  rainabba: Hmm. Just realized I'm on the wrong path. Given "<div><span>A</span></div>" I can use $('div span').html() to refer to the "A", but I want to prepend it to it's parent so the result is "<div>A<span></span></div>". That possible w/o creating a loop?
15:35  rainabba: each() appropriate I think ?
15:35  webben: rainabba: you mean you want to move the text of the span out of the span and into the parent element?
15:36  rainabba: That's distilled for explanation, but yes.
15:37  rainabba: Basically, I'm converting tables full of <input type="radio"> and generating my own UI to look like something analog (pencil/paper) and have <label> with content but I've hidden <input> and am exposing it's behavior and content to a parent container.
15:38  thinkt4nk: can someone suggest a kickass charting plugin?
15:38  webben: rainabba: I'm confused why you're moving text between nodes though.
15:39  rainabba: <label> is display:none; so I need to move it's contents up to where it'll be visible.
15:39  rainabba: yay!
15:40  rainabba: jQuery FTW! $('table.rbl tbody tr td span label').each(function (index) {
15:40  rainabba:                     $(this).parent().parent().prepend($(this).html());

15:42  jones-: Hello. I'm using $.ajax to to a ajax call, but it always happens via GET even if I said POST. Can anyone tell me why? This is the code: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/304308/
15:43  webben: rainabba: Note that will break label. (e.g. won't be read by screen readers, won't gain default label behaviors like clicking on the label to focus a field/select an option)
15:43  Brodingo: holler
15:43  webben: rainabba: Better to move or style label itself.
15:44  rainabba: Hmm. Not a bad idea :) Damn, would my click event move with that element despite it no longer being a child of <input>?
15:44  thinkt4nk: my kingdom (albeit modest) for a decent jquery charting plugin!
15:44  RTPMatt: jones-: it looks right, are you sure is it doing a get not a post?  what happens if you use $.post instead of $.ajax?
15:45  rainabba: webben: Also, how do I move (copy/detach/etc)?
15:45  webben: rainabba: http://api.jquery.com/remove/
15:45  webben: rainabba: Re click events ... depends how you attach them
15:45  webben: rainabba: I recommend using http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
15:46  rainabba: ok. Ty again.
15:46  jones-: RTPMatt: I'm sure, because on the script that the ajax call calls, request.POST is empty and request.GET has all the data. I'll try that.
15:47  RTPMatt: jones-: that is a terrbile way to be "sure" open firebug, watch the ajax request and see if it says POST or GET
15:47  jones-: RTPMatt: same, I still get stuff in GET.
15:47  jones-: RTPMatt: how do I "watch" it?
15:48  jones-: RTPMatt: still... I'm relying on the content of request.POST on the server side, so I expect the data to be there.
15:48  jones-: (I'm using django server-side, FWIW)
15:49  _ZARDOZ: Get is terrible handling large quantities
15:49  RTPMatt: if you open firebug on the console pannel, it will show your ajax requests are they are fired off, you can see them, and see exactly what they return
15:49  jones-: ok I'll try that
15:50  RTPMatt: no doubt, but "because I expect this from the server" is a terrble way to test when you have the ability to see exactly if it was a get or post

16:08  tsyrak: guys, a couple of questions about syntax
16:09  ablomen: Absolute0, XMLHttpRequest << rename that variable, for one
16:09  tsyrak: 1- what do you call the $() selector? (what's his name? wanna find it in the docs, stupid really)
16:10  tsyrak: 2- can you update properties of a whole class at once? e.g: update the width and height of all items returned by $('.myclass')
16:10  jmar777: tsyrak: for 1, look here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
16:10  tsyrak: does the syntax allow something like: 		$( '.myclass' ).width = $( '.myclass' ).width * display.zoom / 100;
16:10  ablomen: Absolute0, the first argument of the callback function is the return data, naming this XMLHttpRequest is kinda weird... and it might overwrite the XMLHttpRequest function, which ajax requests use..
16:10  jmar777: tsyrak: for 2, yes
16:11  jmar777: tsyrak: for example, $('.myclass').width(42)
16:11  Absolute0: ablomen: that's what I get for copy/pasting :)
16:11  Absolute0: and laziness...
16:11  tsyrak: jmar777: what about the syntax above? all items in my class have different width/height but i want to update all of them with the same ratio
16:12  tsyrak: do i *have to* use .each then?
16:12  Absolute0: ablomen: can the last argument be XMLHttpRequest?
16:12  Absolute0: jQuery.post( url, [ data ], [ success(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) ], [ dataType ] )
16:12  ablomen: Absolute0, don't use the variable XMLHttpRequest for anything
16:13  ablomen: Absolute0, it's a built-in function, you don't want to overwrite that
16:13  Absolute0: right
16:13  Absolute0: also is that the proper way to parse json?
16:13  jmar777: tsyrak: ahh, you can use .each, or you could use the setter callback
16:14  ablomen: Absolute0, you can use $.getJSON (instead of post), $.parseJSON, or JSON.parse() like you are doing now
16:14  ablomen: but you need to load an extra library for that

16:21  ablomen: hariom, you have console.log() somehwere
16:21  ablomen: hariom, that breaks your code, since console is not defined unless you turn firebug on

16:22  ablomen: hariom, either remove the console.log
