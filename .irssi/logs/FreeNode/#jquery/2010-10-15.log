10:47  Funhouse: hey there, has anyone ever had the issue of getting 'object expected' when using jquery with IE 8?
10:47 --- Tigeda_ is now known as Tigeda
10:48  berttrand: when do you get it
10:48  Funhouse: berttrand onload
10:50  johnathanb: Hey, how would I go about adding two serialize things together?
10:51  johnathanb: I need to have 4 separate forms or it messes my layout up, but I want to submit all the information at once.
10:52  berttrand: Funhouse: you will need to be more explicit
10:52  berttrand: ?paste @ Funhouse
10:52  bot-t: Funhouse, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
10:53  berttrand: ?concat
10:53  bot-t: berttrand, .add() - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
10:54  berttrand: johnathanb: so you have 4 arrays and you'd like to concatante them?
10:54  johnathanb: Well if that's what serialize gives you, I thought it just gave you a string though.
10:54  johnathanb: This is my first time using jQuery.
10:55  barfster: Is there a tree menu ready to use?
10:55  barfster: I have built a tree menu in php, but itâ€™s far too slow on slow connections, would be better to have something on the client side.
10:56  berttrand: sorry what are using serialize?
10:56  johnathanb: $.get("http://iphone.app/index.php", $(this).serialize(),
10:56  johnathanb: Like that
10:57  berttrand: I thought you had 4, this will only give you 1
10:57  johnathanb: Well I just didn't show you them all..
10:58  barfster: serialize is a different way of making JSON?
10:58  barfster: Or is it a different format?
10:58  johnathanb: So I have details, env, fire and company all variables of the serialized form content
10:58  johnathanb: According to jQuery docs it's for making a URL string sorta thing
10:58  johnathanb: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
11:03  berttrand: well the serialize() will return a string, so just add the strings togeter, but make sure you put an '&' between the serialised strings
11:06  barfster: How can I include this in my own script? http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/treeview/index.htm
11:06  barfster: I need Demo #1
11:10  johnathanb: So would this work?
11:10  johnathanb: var cereal = details + "&" + env + "&" + fire + "&" + company;
11:10  johnathanb: Well , is that how I should be doing it
11:10 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
11:10  barfster: I need some include or something? Or do I just need jQuery and jQuery UI for http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/treeview/index.htm to work?
11:10  berttrand: var formLen = $("form").length; var concatenated = ''; $("form").each(function(index){concatenated+=$(this).serialize();concatenated+=index<formLen ? "&" : "";}); concatenated
11:11  berttrand: sorry, that should be index<formLen-1
11:13  hrwath: hello ppl
11:14  berttrand: barfster: you need the treeveie menu plugin too
11:14  hrwath: does anyone use TinyMCE via jQuery plugin? I don't know why $('textarea.tinymce').tinymce().setProgressState(1); doesn't work.
11:14  hrwath: setContent works fine
11:14  barfster: How can I retrieve the menu plug-in?
11:15  berttrand: as its says on the page "Directions: Simply download jquery.treeview.zip, and refer to the demo page for the full source of the above 3 demos."
11:16  johnathanb: On Chromes Console thing, I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected Identifier" on line 56, line 56 is var customer_details $(this).serialize();
11:16  johnathanb: And never mind I see what I done.
11:17  superchu: :)
11:19  BEEPBEEP_: how do you select the first certain parent, for example, the first tr parent
11:20  berttrand: $("tr:first").parent()
11:20  BEEPBEEP_: no, I actually meant
11:21  BEEPBEEP_: $('image').parent().parent(), but I hate this
11:21  BEEPBEEP_: so how can I instantly select the entire tr (wich is the second parent)
11:22  berttrand: .closest("tr") - will traverse up the dom, until it fids a TR
11:22  berttrand: *finds*
11:22  BEEPBEEP_: thx :)

11:37  Soothsayer: is there any solution to cross-domain ajax ?
11:37  Soothsayer: without using php
11:37  mheap: For GET requests, yes
11:38  mheap: json-p was developed for that reason
11:38  mekwall: thank god it's friday!
11:38  Soothsayer: mheap: ye, i need only GETr requests
11:39  Soothsayer: mheap: jsonp ?
11:39  mheap: Is the data you want to get in json format?
11:39  Soothsayer: mheap: but the data needs to be strictly json ?
11:39  Soothsayer: mheap: nope
11:41  mheap: Afaik, it does.
11:41  BMCouto: noone wants to stream the jquery conf tomorrow?
11:41  mheap: json-p is cheating really
11:42  mheap: The way it works, is that it it creates a script tag
11:42  DonkeyCongo: How would I go about getting the relative position of one side of an element to anothers?
11:42  mheap: and wraps the data in a function
11:42  mheap: then executes it
11:42  Soothsayer: mheap: i see
11:42  Soothsayer: mheap: ok, how about this
11:42  Soothsayer: in my case.. there is no returned data
11:42  Soothsayer: or i dont care about the returned data
11:43  Cork: anyone know whats the best way to detect if an attribute is a jquery object? if(attr.jquery != undefined) {} or is there a better one?
11:43  Soothsayer: i need the request to be cross-domain and i need to have a callback when it's done successfully
11:43  mheap: Soothsayer, pass
11:44  Soothsayer: thanks for trying
11:46  Asone: guys, is there anyway to make an ajax request to get an image ( binary file ) with jq ?
11:46  Cork: Asone: you could, but there wouldn't be much you could do with it
11:47  Cork: Asone: there isn't much you can do with stringified binary image data in js anyway
11:47  Asone: Cork : even control the status request ?
11:47  Cork: Asone: what is it you want to do?
11:49  Asone: cork : i want to be able to do that when the image is loading, to have bind click on the div where the image is gonna be displayed for if user clicks on it
11:49  Asone: and if image is not fully loaded it displays something else
11:49  Asone: that's why i need to control request status with ajax :)
11:50  Cork: Asone: no
11:50  Asone: what no ?
11:50  Cork: just bind onload on the image element
11:50  Asone: Cork : i tried with onload, but it doesn't wait for image being fully loaded
11:51  Asone: last time i tried that i got that result
11:51  Cork: var img = $('<img/>'); img.load(function() { alert('loaded'); }); img.attr('src', 'url');
11:51  Asone: thx
11:51  Cork: Asone: it waits untill ints fully loaded, but might not wait for it to be fully rendered
11:51  Asone: ha
11:51  Asone: ok
11:52  Asone: and is there any function to control the status of the rendering ?
11:52  Cork: not that i know of
11:52  Cork: but normally its about ms
11:52  Cork: so it doesn't really matter if your not writing a game or something
11:53  Cork: (and then you would want to preload the images anyway)
11:53  Asone: thanks for all that info Cork
11:53  Asone: just one last thing, for curiosity
11:53 --- normal2 is now known as jan_d
11:53  Asone: with a standard ajax request ( without jq ) is it possible to usually loads images ?
11:54  Asone: ( or binaries files in general )
11:54  Soothsayer: mheap: you still here?
11:54  berttrand: xhr will load anything its told to load and will be delivered by a server
11:54  mheap: aye
11:54  Cork: Asone: as i said before, the limitation isn't in ajax/xmlhttprequest
11:54  kaputtmacher: how can i change the value of an existing var via click on a link?
11:54  Cork: Asone: it is in the fact that there isn't really anything you can do with it
11:55  Soothsayer: mheap: right now what im doing is... i have a hidden iframe and im submitting the form to the cross domain url with the target as this iframe
11:55  kaputtmacher: i'm trying to modify the slideshow behaviour of the cycle plugin
11:55  Asone: cork : manipulation/modification of the pic ?
11:55  Asone: ( for example )
11:55  Soothsayer: mheap: i don't want the returned data, but at least i want to know when the request is complete (Which is not possible with an iframe)
11:55  Cork: Asone: that needs canvas
11:55 --- kurund_ is now known as kurund
11:56  Asone: 'k
11:56  mheap: Soothsayer, there is no way to use a callback, afaik
11:56  mheap: if you just want to call it, you can create an img element and set the URL as the src
11:56  mheap: that'll load it
11:56  Asone: thanks for all :)
11:56  Cork: Soothsayer: you can attach loaded to an iframe
11:56  Cork: so its posible
11:56  Soothsayer: Cork: i doubt
11:56  Cork: *attach onload
11:56  Soothsayer: i dont think it will work with cross-domain
11:57  jan_d: kaputtmacher: $('#target').click(function() {
11:57  jan_d:   yourVariableName="your new value";
11:57  jan_d: });
11:58  kaputtmacher: jan_d: thx i will try that one
11:58  jan_d: Is there any documentation on the jquery UI event objects?
11:58  Cork: Soothsayer: http://jsbin.com/alahu3/edit
12:00  jan_d: on ui events like "dragstart" two objects are passed to the handler: "event" and "UI". I'd like to know what they are for and what they contain.
12:00  jan_d: but can't find anything.
12:01  Cork: jan_d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event
12:01  Cork: jan_d: its just the browser default event object
12:02  eigentor: I created kind of a javascript mess but maybe you can still help me. I combined a click function with jquery accordion to make the header clickable. Now I only want to allow the accordion function if the user does not click the header. Accordion shall only open automatically because of the active switch. I guess this needs some if/else... http://pastebin.com/
12:02  eigentor: else I would have to change 50 Html files which is a drag
12:04  eigentor: writing this i realize how silly that is...
12:04  eigentor: but nonetheless
12:04  jan_d: Cork: I see. But "UI" is not a standard-Event object and it is passed as well.
12:04  berttrand: eigentor: unbind the click on the accordian ?
12:05  eigentor: ah
12:05  Cork: jan_d: its documented in the same place as the control
12:05  eigentor: so I write the unbind into the click function
12:06  Cork: uh... or was at least...
12:06  jan_d: Cork: any backups known? ;-)
12:07  Cork: jan_d: was it draggable you where interested in=
12:07  Cork: *?
12:08  jan_d: Cork: draggable at the moment, but as I deal with the other stuff soon I am looking for a place to find them all documented
12:09  eigentor: berttrand: yay, this appears to be workin'
12:09  eigentor: great
12:09  Cork: jan_d: the ui is documented in overview here http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
12:09  lavr-ik: how can i make the font-size dependable on parent's block height or width?
12:09  Cork: lavr-ik: you can't
12:10  Cork: except calculating it and changing the px value
12:10  jan_d: Cork: thanks! Expected this in the "Events" section so i did not find it.
12:10  lavr-ik: :(
12:11  Cork: jan_d: the documentation for jquery-ui is sadly a bit thin at times
12:17  SugaSlide: the battle of the sexes will never be won, there is too much flirting with the enemy
12:24  felixjet: could someone give me a hand please? im trying to do something like commenting edit, when a user click edit on his own comment, appear a textarea with the content of the comment, but i want to prevent that the user edit 2 comments at same time, until the first is accepted or declined, he cant press "edit" again
12:24  DonkeyCongo: Is there a way, other than .css().substr(-2), to get the the padding/border widths as integers rather than Xpx?
12:24  sgronblo: anyone using jslint? isnt this "too many var statements" a bit ridiculous?
12:25  felixjet: i've think in something like when he press the edit button, var whatever = 1; and unset the var when the user accept or decline. while the var exists, another edit button cant be pressed
12:25  felixjet: but i dont think thats a good idea
12:25  felixjet: anyone else ?
12:26  felixjet: please ;d
12:26  DonkeyCongo: felixjet: Or assign the form an id/class and check for it when you create a new
12:26  felixjet: if the textarea appears from a $.get() its possible to read its id later?
12:26  DonkeyCongo: if( $("#active-comment-form").length )
12:26  felixjet: dont i need something like live() and stuff?
12:27  nail_: or disable all other buttons when you click one
12:27  DonkeyCongo: Or as nail_ suggested
12:27  DonkeyCongo: Probably better
12:27  felixjet: mmm, i can assign a class to all edit links
12:27  felixjet: and hide it when edit is press
12:27  felixjet: and show it when accept/declien
12:27  felixjet: thats the better way?
12:28  DonkeyCongo: Probably more user-friendly
12:28  DonkeyCongo: Or simply disable it
12:28  felixjet: but if i hide it, someone will be able to modifiy source with firebug and enable it
12:28  felixjet: dont ?
12:29  DonkeyCongo: sure
12:29  DonkeyCongo: But they can also just create the form
12:29  felixjet: ouch xD
12:30  felixjet: well, doesnt matter at all
12:30 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
12:30  felixjet: should i use show() and hide() ?
12:30  felixjet: or another ones
12:31  DonkeyCongo: felixjet: Up to you.
12:31  felixjet: k :) thanks to all
12:35  BEEPBEEP_: felixjet> but if i hide it, someone will be able to modifiy source with firebug and enable it
12:35  BEEPBEEP_: those are just local changes
12:35  felixjet: yea i know
12:35  felixjet: but they can send the data
12:35  felixjet: to the server
12:36  BEEPBEEP_: heh, true
12:36  BEEPBEEP_: so have some sort of server side validation?
12:38  felixjet: nah but its ok, it doesnt really matter if the user wants to edit 20 of his posts at the same time
12:38  felixjet: i just want to prevent showing 20 textareas at the same time with content editing
12:38  felixjet: looks ugly
12:39  felixjet: but if the user modifiy it... up to his own xD

13:37  Altreus: Is there a simple way of finding the index of, e.g., a given <li> in its parent <ul>? I can concoct a not-simple way of course..
13:37  berttrand: uro put all the options into an .each(function(){}) - each iteratarion, this === the option

13:38  Altreus: Is counting its previous siblings the easiest way?
13:38  Altreus: or at least a sensible way
13:38  JamieD: berttrand: the live method is not appropriate in my situation. I came across similar code to what I posted in a script and wasn't sure exactly how it would react
13:39  berttrand: in the method you are posting your are removing b then trying to attach it, how can you attach something you have remioved?
13:39  zalun: SugaSlide: try resizing
13:39  berttrand: *append it*
13:39  SugaSlide: na i see what happened
13:39  SugaSlide: the js failed to run

13:40  zalun: yoda I speak
13:41  berttrand: altreus: so $(".myUL").index("li:first")  etc
13:41  Altreus: berttrand: yea :D I did $(this).index('li.selected')
13:41  Altreus: that's cool
13:41  Altreus: thanks ^_^
13:43  JamieD: berttrand: it's assigned to the b variable, so I'm assuming that jquery is only removing the elements from the page, then when you append b to the page again it's loading it from the variable's data which may or may not have it's events removed
13:43  berttrand: ?paste @JamieD

18:17  ajpiano: seems to ring a bell with life
18:17  darcyclarke: delegate() insipired watch()'s multiple comma seperate events...
18:17  chrislerum: delegate is for many events, live for one?
18:18  danheberden: scrubbing bubbles just reminded me of that. my mom said once she came into the bathroom and i had crest toothpast all over the counter and sink saying 'i'm trying to make the guys come out'
18:18  Xaero: http://jsfiddle.net/uuPBh/
18:18  Xaero: $('#ajaxcontent').load(popAJAX);
18:18  Xaero: thats where i think im having the problem
18:18  danheberden: more pike poopAJAX
18:18  danheberden: *like
18:18 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
18:18  Xaero: lol
18:18  paul_irish: Xaero: what kind of element is that
18:18  Xaero: its a div
18:19  paul_irish: oh i see.. ajax load... i'm with you
18:19  chrislerum: nvm, i see there's more to it
18:19  Xaero: in firefox it works like i want it to, it .loads everytime
18:20  paul_irish: its messy but it looks kinda right Xaero
18:20  Xaero: but in ie it only .loads 1 time
18:20  paul_irish: ie8 dev tools help?
18:20  paul_irish: Xaero: do  you do anything to the A that triggers it?
18:20  danheberden: url + '?' + Date.getTime() ?
18:21  Xaero: the a looks like
18:21  Xaero: <a href="#?w=600" rel="ajax" ajax="test.php" class="popajax">Test</a>
18:21  Xaero: but javascript doesnt change it
18:21  danheberden: papa-jax.. does he offer werthers candy?
18:22  danheberden: so .load( urlWhatEva, { cacheBuster: Date.getTime() } )
18:22  Xaero: yeah but you gotta go for a ride in his van
18:22  Xaero: thanks
18:22  danheberden: per ajpiano 's idea that that was what was broked
18:22  Xaero: ill try that
18:22  annasob: hey can someone help me with my <ul> drop down menu. I have jquery edditing the css display property but i want it to actually animate instead of just appearing
18:23  ajpiano: danheberden: the only problem with not appending to th URL is that when you add data to .load() it becomes a POST instead of a GET so if he's looking for things on the serverside in the URL
18:23  ajpiano: it'l be broken
18:23  danheberden: oh thoughts load was get by default
18:23  annasob: i tried changing the height with animate but that causes it to move up and down constantly
18:23  danheberden: url it is
18:24  danheberden: never use load, i only use .ajax.. its like taking your coffee black.. but manly-er
18:24  Xaero: yeah that broke it

18:26  danheberden: godhood.. that sounds dirty

18:26  danheberden: hahaha
18:26  annasob: dr4g: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/coda-slider.html
18:26  chrislerum: i assume you meant minora
18:26  danheberden: yea, much better lol
18:27  darcyclarke: good ol' remy sharp
18:27  dr4g: nice and snappy annasob
18:27  SugaSlide: couldnt $("table").delegate("td", "hover", function(){ just be $("table td").live("hover" ?
18:27  danheberden: chrislerum: neg: majora
18:28  danheberden: its a REALLY big hood
18:28  danheberden: like a hood scoop
18:28  danheberden: on an old dragster
18:28  chrislerum: ewe
18:28  ajpiano: SugaSlide: the whole point is to actually catch clicks on the table, not to have everything bubble to the document and check it there, which is what live does
18:28  danheberden: and gonna stop this train before it gets off the tracks :)
18:28  SugaSlide: k
18:29  SugaSlide: cause the api thing for delegate is o.O
18:29  SugaSlide: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
18:29  SugaSlide: Is equivalent to the following code written using .live():
18:29  SugaSlide: lol
18:29  SugaSlide: not too sure anyone would write it like that?
18:29  dr4g: Can someone suggest a good slider to go into this site? www.ppiframework.com
18:29  SugaSlide: im probs very wrong
18:29  dr4g: annasob, the coda one doesn't suit my design.
18:30  annasob: what were u looking to make slide dr4g
18:30  dr4g: content? :P
18:30  annasob: looking at the site now
18:30  dr4g: images, text..etc
18:30  blackspotwiggins: dr4g, you can use jquery ui slider, just apply custom styles
18:30  ajpiano: SugaSlide: so you're saying that you can only imagine people would prefer to use live, and never use delegate?
18:30  ajpiano: live is too... magic
18:30  ajpiano: delegate is what live is, only that it is called by its proper name and has more fine grained control... event delegation
18:30  dr4g: blackspotwiggins, isn't the slider for dragging and moving ?
18:30  sanguisleft: is there a way to use the the jquery maphighlight to keep the "mouseovered" <maps> highlighted when clicked on and the if they are clicked on again un highlight?
18:30  annasob: so in that link the content starts at PPI is now the Official...
18:31  SugaSlide: lol ajpiano na.. what im saying is the docs make use of a wierd .each :P for a simpleselector thing... im actualy wondering why use .live at all
18:31  blackspotwiggins: dr4g, didnt you ask for a slider?
18:31  SugaSlide: delegate > live
18:31  SugaSlide: by what i read
18:31  kjy112: wib: Hey wib are you there?  I found out it has to do with the image width its retriving the width of the browser instead of just the slider : Nivo Slider
18:31  dr4g: blackspotwiggins, a content slider, not a draggable one.
18:31  blackspotwiggins: ah
18:31  annasob: you can eliminate the navigation in the link i provided u and just use the < > arrows
18:32  ajpiano: SugaSlide: that example is there for illustrative purposes so that people understand that they're both implementations of event delegation
18:32  dr4g: annasob, no the slider is the top main area, with grey background and the little circles to change the current tab
18:32  ajpiano: not that you should actually use .live that way
18:32  ManxPower: What terms would I use to search for the things that can be set by the jQuery .attr()
18:32  paul_irish: everything that's an attribute.
18:33  mathi: hi
18:33  ajpiano: ?g "everything that's an attribute"
18:33  paul_irish: ?mdc dom attributes
18:33  bot-t: paul_irish, Node.attributes - Though commonly referred to as an  Array or NodeList , the .attributes collection is a NamedNodeMap , an unordered list of Attr nodes.  The nodes are not stored in any particular order. . attribute... https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node.attributes
18:33  bot-t: ajpiano, No results found for '"everything that's an attribute"'.
18:33  ManxPower: paul_irish, I suspect searching for "html attributes" would not be helpful
18:33  annasob: ohh nice dr4g ya so on circle click do the animation that is in the link i provided
18:33  mathi: why does the following always return "undefined" ?   var nb = $('input.select').is(':checked').length;
18:33  paul_irish: it might
18:33  SugaSlide: isnt $("table").each(function(){ $("td", this) the same as $("table td")? at ajpiano
18:33  Xaero: fixed it ;]
18:33  Xaero: $('#ajaxcontent').load(popAJAX + "?" + Math.random()*99999 );
18:33  paul_irish: mathi: is() returns a boolean
18:33  ajpiano: mathi: .is() returns r
18:33  paul_irish: no .length neccessary
18:33  ajpiano: ^^
18:33  Xaero: lol stupid ie!
18:33  paul_irish: BAM
18:33  ajpiano: SugaSlide: yes
18:34  mathi: paul_irish, I want to cound the number of checkboxes checked (that's why I have put .is(':checked'))
18:34  ajpiano: well, not *exactly*
18:34  ManxPower: thanks ajpiano
18:34  mathi: *count
18:34  ManxPower: ..er.. paul_irish I mean.
18:34  ajpiano: mathi: first of all "select" is a uniquely terrible class name to put on an input element
18:34  mathi: why ?
18:34  ajpiano: because it's the name of another element
18:34  Jonz: its also a tag name
18:34  paul_irish: .filter( instead
18:35  dr4g: annasob, ok ty
18:35  ajpiano: it would be like having <span class='div'>
18:35  mathi: :D
18:35  SugaSlide: ajpiano hehe :D when i looked at the eg's first reaction was whoa delegate is cooler since ity will be faster since it doesnt need a .each :P
18:35  SugaSlide: then i noticed the .each was redundent...
18:35  ajpiano: mathi: $("input.foo:checked").length
18:35  ManxPower: Hmm..that was not helpful.    I'm trying to use jquery or javascript to set the onLoad= for an iframe.  What is the right term for that?
18:35  ajpiano: ManxPower: $("#foo").load(fn)
18:35  mathi: k thank you buddy, i'll chenge that class name for you
18:35  SugaSlide: so looked at what delegate actualy does... and its just cooler.. simple
18:36  mathi: input.ajpiano:checked
18:36  ManxPower: ajpiano, Ha!  I was making it too complicated.
18:36  ajpiano: yeah
18:36  ajpiano: i was about to ?xy problem you

18:40  SugaSlide: Hopsy o.O
18:40  SugaSlide: -_-
18:40  Hopsy: SugaSlide: haha =p
18:40  SugaSlide: btw... 1 min in...
18:40  ajpiano: yeah, erichynds i was thinking he'd need to grep, but also use underscore's _.equals
18:40  SugaSlide: does that count as masturbating?
18:40  paul_irish: hi Hopsy
18:40  mathi: ajpiano, this returns NULL : booking.parent('tr').html()   I am in an element inside a TD, I would like to get the TR element but it's not a direct parent
18:40  ajpiano: cause you can't compare objects for equality in native JS
18:41  Hopsy: hi paul_irish
18:41  erichynds: true..
18:41  ajpiano: ?closest @ mathi
18:41  bot-t: mathi, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
18:41  erichynds: could you $.param the objects and compare as string?
18:41  SugaSlide: -_-
18:41  SugaSlide: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18:41  Hopsy: SugaSlide: she likes to sumcheck lol
18:41  lith: erich: thanks ma
18:41  ajpiano: only if you were 100% they'd all stringify in the same order
18:41  lith: n
18:41  ManxPower: If I wanted to do something similar to iframe.style.display = "none"; in jquery would it be $('#myframeid').attr('display', 'none');
18:41  mathi: ajpiano, works great !! thanks !!!!
18:41  Hopsy: are you masturbating SugaSlide?
18:41  Hopsy: ieuww gross
18:41  erichynds: i wouldn't rely on it
18:41  SugaSlide: furies
18:41  mathi: Hopsy, yes
18:42  mathi: oops wasnt for me
18:42  ajpiano: ManxPower: $("#foo").hide()
18:42  ajpiano: or .css("display","none')

18:42  bot-t: SugaSlide and paul_irish
18:42  SugaSlide: after that vid...
18:42  SugaSlide: add hopsy to the list!!!!!!!!!!
18:42  Hopsy: bot-t: pervert is SugaSlide, paul_irish and mathi
18:42  bot-t: Hopsy, Changed "pervert".
18:42  ManxPower: ajpiano, any reason to use one .vs the other?
18:42  Hopsy: what keind of list :\
18:42  mathi: omg :-(
18:43  annasob: paul_irish: can i bug u for a second
18:43  vladikoff: sup Hopsy
18:44  ajpiano: ManxPower: i would stick to hide for shortness
18:44  Hopsy: hey vladikoff
18:44  itmustbejj: how can I get a slice to return the last 10 items if $('#foo li:visible').slice(-10,-1).hide(); only returns 9 (ignores the last item) b/c I obviously can't say -0
18:44  ajpiano: ManxPower: you also could have a css class like .hidden
18:44  ajpiano: and apply that
18:44  ajpiano: so you wouldn't get any inline styles either way
18:44  ManxPower: ajpiano, .hide() seems more logical to me
18:45  ajpiano: you'll still end up wtih an inline style when you use .hide()
18:45  blackspotwiggins: ManxPower, you can override hide() if it gives you a boner
18:46  itmustbejj: maybe I could store $('#foo li:visible') in a var and say $('#foo li:visible').slice(-10,var.length).hide();  Would that work?
18:46  paul_irish: annasob: not about jquery :/
18:46  g_: is it possible to rotate images in jq?
18:46  SugaSlide: favorite beer @ paul_irish :P
18:46  g_: just small images for previews
18:46 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
18:46  SugaSlide: lets take this old school :D
18:47  ManxPower: I'm at the point where I am still struggling to know what questions to ask.
18:47  annasob: yes paul_irish about jquery i want this page to do a slide on product mouseover instead of just appear: http://matrix.senecac.on.ca/~asobiepa/jquery/
18:47  ajpiano: itmustbejj, what about just .slice(-10)
18:47  paul_irish: someone else can help my dear
18:47  paul_irish: im terribly busy today
18:47  itmustbejj: ajpiano doh I thought slice needed 2 params
18:47  ajpiano: paul_irish are you on the traino
18:47  itmustbejj: *args
18:47  annasob: cool cool
18:47  ajpiano: second param is optional
18:47  ajpiano: ?mdc slice @ itmustbejj

18:49  blackspotwiggins: with transform
18:51  Hopsy: SugaSlide: what keeinndd oofff lissttt
18:51  ajpiano: annasob: use slideDown and slideUp
18:51  Hopsy: do you have a black list?
18:51  g_: css3 it is then: -moz-transform: rotate(-15deg);
18:51  Hopsy: an ignore list?
18:51  SugaSlide: huh?
18:51  annasob: ajpiano: let me try
18:51  Darsain: anyone with experience of developing chrome extensions?
18:51  Hopsy: [18:42:30] <SugaSlide> after that vid...
18:51  Hopsy: [18:42:36] <SugaSlide> add hopsy to the list!!!!!!!!!!
18:51  ajpiano: you should probably change that to use like, mouseenter and mouseleave

18:52  SugaSlide: you already on the other lists....
18:52  Hopsy: which other list :\
18:52  Brodingo: g_ http://css3please.com
18:52  SugaSlide: aparently he behaved himself today
18:52  Ely2: Hi can I put transparancy on a div and make the content in the div don't react on that transparancy?
18:52  Hopsy: who is he?
18:53  g_: the man in the mirror
18:53  paul_irish: chill with the pervert talk guyzzz
18:53  SugaSlide: SHE STARTED IT
18:53  SugaSlide: z0mg
18:54  g_: Brodingo: ohh - awesome link. even if it is hosted on dreamhost
18:54  ajpiano: rofl
18:54  ajpiano: it's one thing to have like, negative judgments about a particular host
18:54  ajpiano: it's another thing to judge a website by the host that it is on
18:54  ajpiano: :p
18:54  orolo: http://jsfiddle.net/KKfjU/ how can get to view.visStart outside of the plugin call? or how can i add the .click() inside the plugin call
18:54  blackspotwiggins: Ely2, you mean like rgba background?
18:54  g_: ajpiano: so you agree with me dreamhost sucks then :)
18:55  SugaSlide: lol
18:55  ajpiano: dreamhost blows the big one, but i'd never look at a website and be like, wow, it's on dreamhost, lame
18:55  Brodingo: no, you know who sucks? fucking siteground and network solutions
18:55  blackspotwiggins: that's like discrimination based on IP ranges :)
18:55  SugaSlide: how did you find that info out so quickly?
18:55  ajpiano: VPS ftw
18:55  SugaSlide: chrome flags?
18:55  Brodingo: bluehost here
18:55  SugaSlide: cheapest + best host recomendations?
18:56  Brodingo: hostgator maybe
18:56  g_: fast, cheap, good. choose two
18:56  ajpiano: i've user lunarpages and totalchoice in the past but like i said,
18:57  ajpiano: vps all the way
18:57  g_: ajpiano++
18:57  danheberden: rackspace cloud
18:57  ajpiano: you can spend like, 5-8 bucks a month on some shitty shared hosting
18:57  g_: which will be mostly down, and bogged down
18:57  ajpiano: or drop 20 bucks a month and have like, a full fledged server that you have root command line access to
18:57  TurkeR: first of all use vps after when usage grows up move to a dedicated
18:58  g_: first few weeks on dreamhost i was like wtf does my site keep going down, so i ssh'd in, did top and saw a bittorrent server running. i was like wtf
18:58  SugaSlide: lol
18:58  SugaSlide: hmm i wanna get my own server some time :(
18:58  ajpiano: i had someone on dreamhost a whiel back, and they were running movable type... dreamhost would shut down processes if they started to take too much RAM, so she couldn't publish the blog
18:58  g_: the 'support' people were like, 'oh really?', we'll keep on eye on it
18:58  ajpiano: pita
18:59  g_: yeah support talk to you like you're ten
18:59  g_: "the happy dreamhost team"
18:59  SugaSlide: you dream they will actualy host
18:59  SugaSlide: :P

19:00  around: Heyo
19:01  yxz97: I have problem with a responde from an ajax
19:01  ajpiano: annasob from what i can tell you didn't change anything
19:01  yxz97: with and undefined variable
19:01  annasob: lol let me ftp
19:01  around: What is the orthodox way of using HTML skeletons/templates with jQuery, basically I need a clean way to template and replace keys ala sprintf()
19:02  annasob: ok updated ajpiano
19:02  SugaSlide: we have a server 2008 dedi server... its sweet
19:02  ajpiano: around: seen the new jquery.tmpl plugin ?
19:02  SugaSlide: ex job place :(
19:02  around: ajpiano: never, ill have a look
19:02  Rixius: check this out http://gist.github.com/628546 something I just threw together, external template fetching
19:03  Rixius: as well as caching
19:03  Rixius: not quite directed at aroudn, you should check out the core tmpl first
19:03  ajpiano: ?templating @ around
19:03  bot-t: around, jQuery's official templating solution - http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl | underscore.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ | mustache.js - http://mustache.github.com/
19:03  Rixius: around I mean >.>
19:04  danheberden: what ajpiano is trying to say, is use clone() as much as possible
19:04  ajpiano: lol
19:04  danheberden: heh heh
19:04  Rixius: and remember to pass true if you need events
19:04  danheberden: if you like mad delays, page stalls and overall shitty performance
19:04  SugaSlide: ROFL
19:05  SugaSlide: ajpiano++ for that xkcd thing
19:05  Rixius: because it does threequals (===) so 1 won't cut it
19:05  danheberden: ?g xkcd regular expressions
19:05  bot-t: danheberden, xkcd: Regular Expressions - http://xkcd.com/208/
19:05  danheberden: ah, cartoon gold
19:06 * MooingLemur has the shirt
19:06 * Rixius wants the book
19:06  MooingLemur: someone stole mine almost 10 years ago
19:06 * SugaSlide wants the skillZ
19:06  danheberden: questionalcontent.net is pretty neat
19:07  Rixius: Everyone wants the skillz >.>
19:07  Rixius: eh, SMBC is nice
19:08 --- ezra-g is now known as ezra-g|Luncheroo
19:08  Rixius: I think we're wandering off-topic >.>
19:08  Rixius: and it's all ajpiano 's fault <.<
19:09  Ely2: blackspotwiggins
19:09  Ely2: uhm maybe yes
19:09  Ely2: I could try that
19:09  Ely2: is it supported by all browsers ?
19:09  blackspotwiggins: nope
19:09  blackspotwiggins: ie8+
19:09  Ely2: ok I cna live with that :p
19:10  blackspotwiggins: prolly you could set solid backgrounds for retard browsers
19:11  Ely2: the problem is I got this flip plugin
19:11  Ely2: and you have to set a bg
19:11  Ely2: when oyu don't it's grey
19:11  ajpiano: annasob, http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/TvVY7/  you 'll see i included the hoverIntent plugin and basically followed all the advice in see ?fix hover
19:11  bot-t: annasob, Tutorials:PNG Opacity Fix for IE6 - How to make transparent PNGs possible in Internet Explorer 6 http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:PNG_Opacity_Fix_for_IE6
19:11  Ely2: http://yougodigital.be/Q/ like here
19:11  SugaSlide: danheberden i have questionablecontent rss feed in outlook :D
19:11  ajpiano: ?fix hover @ annasob
19:11  bot-t: annasob, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using doTimeout (http://bit.ly/12WSwE). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
19:13  danheberden: heh heh
19:13  SugaSlide: it used to have a punchy storry... and alot more pint size...
19:13  SugaSlide: now its more like a soapie
19:13  SugaSlide: :(
19:13  Ely2: is it possible to let this script accept background images when flipping instead of a color?
19:13  Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/58mPu/
19:14  danheberden: i like it's path - good plot 'n stuff, but yeah - could use more pintsize for sure
19:14  danheberden: i just hate hanners
19:14  SugaSlide: pint size early days > all
19:14  OhaiBBQ: go to sleep, danheberden!
