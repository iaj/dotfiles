00:00  devinrolsen: BarelyFitz * (sorry)
00:01  BarelyFitz: devinrolsen: yeah, that's correct. not sure why you're getting null. do you get anything for errorThrown?
00:01  ManxPower: Is anyone familiar with jqModal?
00:01  devinrolsen: one sec, sorry on SVN with no local
00:01  devinrolsen: let me try that
00:02  jedmund: dunno if that made any sense frioden
00:03  RoosterJuice: how would I select the second to last row in a table?
00:03  devinrolsen: BarelyFitz - I get [object Error]
00:03  Mnosh: hi there, i need some help with some json error here: : http://ivpaste.com/v/fY6giO1W
00:03  devinrolsen: not very helpful :)
00:03  devinrolsen: is that normal?
00:04  Mnosh: its says: Error: jQuery.parseJSON is not a function
00:04 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
00:05  RoosterJuice: anyone know how to reference the second last row of a table with a selector?
00:05  devinrolsen: BarelyFitz - here is my function http://pastebin.com/3UibVSgR
00:05  devinrolsen: works perfect in FF.. but always gets caught up in the client side error: in IE
00:06  Famic_: RoosterJuice: you can check index of :last and get index-1
00:07 --- rchern-afk is now known as rchern
00:09  BarelyFitz: devinrolsen: looks okay to me. what's with the funny quotes in your data attribute?
00:10  devinrolsen: have no idea bud, someone else wrote it and now its not working today :\... thats the first thing I went after to try and attack.. however no matter how I format data "correctly" for json it breaks in FF as well
00:11  devinrolsen: if I leave it as is lol it works in FF as should and back to square one with it not working in IE haha
00:11  devinrolsen: around and around we go
00:11  BarelyFitz: try using a proxy like charlesproxy.com to see what the request and response looks like
00:11  devinrolsen: k
00:11  devinrolsen: you mean in FF right
00:12  BarelyFitz: in IE as well
00:12  devinrolsen: how do I see such a thing in IE?
00:12  BarelyFitz: charlesproxy.com
00:12  devinrolsen: :) thx
00:18  coldhead: CAN I KICK IT
00:19  nvictor: kick what?
00:20  OhaiBBQ: bot-t: tell eTiger13 "OhaiBBQ: didnt know that was your real name"  .. wat
00:20  bot-t: OhaiBBQ, Okay.
00:20  ManxPower: I can get the modal open, but $(this).find('> td:nth-child(1) > a').attr('href')  seems to be "undefined".  http://pastebin.com/QSgbbqLB
00:22  devinrolsen: BarelyFitz, in IE nothing gets sent over HTTP. In FF it requests (Pageid    52818) and response is (200 ok)
00:23  devinrolsen: now the weird thing is, nothing gets sent... yet I get the client side error:
00:24  trond-: hi. I have a form inside a tab and I want to validate that the passwords are equal, so i have used the validate plugin. It seems like everything else is working - except for the equal check. website: www.dopinglist.com and click in the graphic on the middle of the page
00:25  hrmphh: could someone please take a look at http://pastebin.com/BNZduwyV and tell me why the select box is not populating correctly with the options returned in the JSON?
00:28  S1kx: hrmphh: looks valid to me, is the alert coming?
00:28  hrmphh: no
00:28  hrmphh: alert is not coming :/
00:29  S1kx: hrmphh: how about wrapping it inside a $(document).ready()
00:29  hrmphh: but the url gets called (im seeing it in access_log)
00:29  S1kx: instead of a $(), i havent seen that yet
00:29  S1kx: hrmphh: maybe youre sending the wrong mime-type in the header
00:29  S1kx: try it with $.ajax() and format: 'json'
00:30  Hierofant: Does anyone here have QT and IE8 installed on a PC? I have a page I'd like you to test if so
00:30  hrmphh: S1kx: isnt that the same thing?
00:30  S1kx: yeah should be,.. but check the header you are sending
00:30  S1kx: the Content-Type has to be specific afaik
00:31  devinrolsen: BarelyFitz - my data: should (normally) look like this? {LocationUrl:window.location.href, ContentID:contentID} or should I put single quotes around the vars?
00:34  maxfreeze: hi! i need some help with a sum, i have a lot of TD with the same id, i want to sum them all and then display the result to a div, is it possible ?
00:34  ajpiano: ?w3c id error
00:34  bot-t: An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.

00:35  |flyte|: how can I get the browser window dimensions? (cross browser version of window.outerHeight) ?
00:36  |flyte|: according to the docs: "$(window).height();   // returns height of browser viewport" with is != to the browser's window height (not just viewport)
00:37  ajavid: ajpiano, what did you think?
00:38  ajpiano: of?
00:38  ajavid: ajpiano, sweet axe yeah?
00:38  ajpiano: lol, yeah
00:38  ajavid: yeah
00:38  ajavid: thats just how I party
00:38  zamba: how can i add a class to a bunch of input fields that contain a certain value?
00:38  ajavid: zamba, is the value static?
00:38  zamba: ajavid: no.. the user will input it
00:38  ajavid: zamba, $("input[value='']").addclass
00:38  zamba: ajavid: and i've written a small function to compare the value with the other values in similar input boxes
00:40  ajavid: i bit my lip
00:40  ajavid: ow
00:40  zamba: ajavid: to my way of doing it? :)
00:40  zamba: ajavid: i'm very new to jquery and javascript, so i'm currently learning to walk :)

00:46  miloj: or maybe I should use something else ?

00:55  Bertrand`: milop: its possible to have more panels open... but you will have to write some code to make it happen

00:57  miloj: Bertrand`, ok, since I know quite nothing in js, I'll try something else
00:57  darcyclarke: of course ;)
00:58  Hierofant: WTF Firefox cache.
00:58  darcyclarke: paul_irish any advice on that other subject in that email?

00:59  paul_irish: o
01:01  ManxPower: in some sample code I'm seeing @href to refer to the value of the href= of the triggering element.  Is this a jQuery thing or a standard JS thing?
01:01  paul_irish: darcyclarke: i imagine this owouldnt be called jQuery for Designers
01:01  paul_irish: right
01:01  darcyclarke: no
01:01  darcyclarke: definitely not
01:01  sanjayb: maxfreeze: maybe because when $('#numeros_adultos') is ready, $('.adultos') is not? what's the behaviour you getting?
01:02  ManxPower: I'm having a horrible time trying to figureout the onshow callback in jqModal
01:02  Bertrand`: maxfreeze: there was much run with code... I've corrected it all for you, but you will need to review what I've changed against tehoriginal

01:24  abadr: Is there any way to have autocomplete show options onfocus? I'm using minLength:0, but I still have to type a char and delete it to show all the options.
01:26  Hierofant: Anyone here with IE8 want to check a page for me please?
01:27  Hierofant: http://bgmezibov.com/film/film1.html
01:27  Hierofant: + quicktime
01:27  abadr: you can get free VMs with different versions of IE straight from MS
01:27  Andreas_: Hi guys.. I've got a box "jumping" around when I run some jQuery on it's parent element. Any of you guys know how to solve it? Site is http://asn24.dk and the problem can be reproduced when clicking the text next to the silhouette.
01:28  Hierofant: abadr Thats nice, but I'm seeing an error on my box and I would like to find out if others have that error
01:28  Hierofant: Also I am not going to buy another seat of Windows just to load a browser
01:29  b0x: abadr: you can?
01:29  b0x: re free VM's
01:29  b0x: I wouldnt think MS did.. anything.. for free
01:30  abadr: yeah you can
01:30  abadr: not sure where :)
01:31  Hierofant: Theres no such thing as a Free Version of Windows
01:32  b0x: no
01:32  b0x: i didnt think so
01:34  nullwire: Is there an equivalent to .sortable("refresh") for a clickable object thats added to DOM after pageload?
01:35  Andreas_: @nullwire: Have a look at .live :)
01:36  abadr: b0x: here you go http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&displaylang=en

01:39  TimothyA: why is it 800MB for a single browser...
01:39  b0x: entire windows installation
01:40  abadr: different combos of windows/IE for testing
01:40  abadr: there's a way to run them under vmware fusion IIRC
01:41  b0x: they expire in a few months anyway
01:41  b0x: and not pass genuine validation
01:41  b0x: better off using suns virtualbox & any xp cd :p
01:43  abadr: up to you
01:43  Hierofant: this is silly.  srsly cannot find a tester
01:43  abadr: maybe someone who understands the autocomplete code better than me can figure out a solution? i've been working on this for a while
01:43  nullwire: If I have <div id="4px border"><div id="button"></div></div> both of which are clickable, is there a way I can stopPropagation(); for the border click when the button is clicked, but continue whatever Propagation is defined for the button itself?
01:44  abadr: just want it to open immediately on focus instead of waiting for change
01:44  nullwire: Hopefully I made enough sense of that
01:44 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
01:49  nullwire: I need a way to stopPropagation(); of all other events except this
01:49  sneakyness: oh man
01:49  sneakyness: hey coldhead
01:49  nullwire: so ive got <div><div id="button"></div></div> both of which are clickable, and both of which propagate when button is clicked. i need just button to click
01:49  sneakyness: do you remember back in 2007 when I rewrote jqtransform for a client?
01:50  sneakyness: because jqtransform's changing of the values wasn't firing the events and whatnot?
01:50  thinkt4nk: I don't remember yesterday when I ate breakfast
01:50  sneakyness: I honestly have no idea what I ate today, but I never forget work

02:02  slashxr: how do i remove this   bla.a = {a:1,b:2};  , want to now completely get rid of,  bla.a but leave rest in tact, how to do so?

02:06  JohnResig: curious if there have been any questions relating to jQuery Mobile in here
02:06  Gidgidonihah: how would i watch the document for any new input[type='date'] and attach a jqueryUI datepicker to it?
02:06  ajpiano: JohnResig: someone wondered why it wasn't in the topic
02:06  JohnResig: Gidgidonihah: not explicitly possible - you'll need to attach them manually (like running them after an ajax request)
02:07  Gidgidonihah: ok, thanks.
02:07  ajpiano: Gidgidonihah: see also ?faq events

02:09  slashxr: i thought jquery runs on all mobile sites already
02:10  unclezoot: ive taken a look at it - brilliant idea, seemed a bit glitchy on iphone4
02:10  sanjayb: Gidgidonihah JohnResig: Would it be possible to use $('input[type="date"]').live("focus") ... and then if not attached, attach the date-picker on focus .. ? not the exact solution looked for.. but that .. should work?
02:10  coldhead: shutup miketaylr, i'll kick you
02:10  ajpiano: sanjayb: yeah, you can do that
02:10  miketaylr: ?coldhead @ coldhead
02:10  bot-t: coldhead, <coldhead> NO U
02:10  ajpiano: you can check if a datepicker is attached by looking in the .data() of the element
02:10  JohnResig: sanjayb: that might work - as long as you want it to come up on focus (and not display on load)
02:11  Gidgidonihah: sanjayb: a downside to that method is the icon next to the input, etc don't appear until focus.

02:17  ajpiano: $("#div2").click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });

02:31  sanjayb: nullwire: code works for me
02:31  sanjayb: nullwire: http://pastie.org/1234218 - when i click on div 2, i get only one alert - 'div 2 clicked' .
02:31  addyosmani: that is so true.
02:31  ben_alman: gf3 why didn't you come?
02:31  addyosmani: I mean, minus the backdrop.
02:31  gf3: ben_alman: didn't have the funds :(

02:32  ajpiano: Haha gf3 hair is amazing!!
02:32  snover: hey, you can’t get that gf3 look from a stylist
02:32  addyosmani: that is so true.
02:33  ben_alman: yeah the only way is to have just gotten out of bed
02:33  addyosmani: how do you do it, gf3?
02:33  gf3: I cut my own hair

02:34  miketaylr: yeah gf3, me and vlad's bathtub just wasn't the same without you in it
02:35  miketaylr: IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
02:35  ajpiano: I have some idea of what you mean
02:37 --- what is now known as Vienzzion
02:38  gf3: miketaylr: OH I NO WAT U MEEN

02:38  gf3: $us.next().prev().next().prev().next().prev().next().prev().next().prev().next().prev()
02:39  addyosmani: ^^ thats how you time-travel in jQuery.
02:39  sneakyness: omg guys guess what
02:39  sneakyness: I just found ALL of the old js files from that stupid fucking job I had
02:39  sneakyness: ...they're on their server exactly where I left them
02:39  sneakyness: it's all like, <1.3 code, ugly ugly stuff
02:41 --- PacketMonkey_ is now known as PacketMonkey
02:45 --- lightcap_ is now known as lightcap
02:47  sneakyness: Hay guys, what do you recommend for skinning select elements?
02:47  sneakyness: I used http://plugins.jquery.com/project/NiceSelect back in the day
02:47  sneakyness: was wondering if anything better has popped up since then
02:47  snover: I recommend CSS
02:48  addyosmani: are you looking for like a generic theme that applies a skin to multiple types of form elements or just select?
02:48  snover: sneakyness: Whichever one gives correct ARIA contexts should be the one to use.
02:48  snover: sneakyness: Basically, if it doesn’t set tabindex and it doesn’t set a role for itself, you should avoid it
02:48  sneakyness: I'm not looking to do anything other than skin some select elements with CSS
02:48  snover: otherwise it was probably written by someone that knew what they were doing and you are good to go
02:49  Acony: I have an <a></a> and I want to store some param there which I can garb easily and use it in ajax call, hints ?
02:49  sneakyness: snover: is there one that you regularly use or would recommend?
02:49  snover: sneakyness: nope
02:49  sneakyness: okay, cool.
02:50  Acony: it cannot be id, or class attribute, must be something else...
02:50  Rotham: how can i setup the accordian widget so that it can have more than 1 box expanded?
02:51  Zyci: hey guys, what's the .info spinner website, spinners.info or something
02:52  Acony: done :P
02:55  themiddleman: Zyci: dont cross post please
02:55  sanjayb: Acony: I personally would recommend data- attributes which are going to be allowed as per the html 5 standard
02:56  gf3: sneakyness: http://pixelmatrixdesign.com/uniform/
02:56  michael`: Does anyone know why, opening a jqueryui dialog, will mess up an id selector, the id selectors works if i don't open a jqueryui dialog
02:56  sanjayb: Acony: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/ .. and now with jquery 1.4.3 you would be able to do things like $('#foo').data("foo") for markup like <a id="foo" data-foo="some data">asdf</a>
02:57  snover: I would recommend using the .attr function instead of .data
02:57  sanjayb: snover: why so?
02:57  Acony: sanjayb, yeap I solved it allready tnx
02:57  addyosmani: I've used uniform a few times. It's not bad.
02:57  snover: sanjayb: conflating js-stored data and html data attributes is not such a good idea
02:58  sanjayb: snover: if it is arbitrary data you are attaching to the DOM, I think data- is the correct way to do it, and not use rel, or some other arbitrary attribute .
02:58  addyosmani: may be overkill for what's needed, but it's a decent solution if you need generic form theming.
02:58  snover: and right now there are a lot of unresolved issues with using .data for html5 attrs
02:58  snover: sanguisleft: it isn’t.
02:58  snover: oops
02:58  snover: sanjayb: it isn’t.
02:58  sanjayb: snover: like what? i have been using data- for some time and have had no problems.
02:59  snover: sanjayb: I mean, argh. Using data attributes is correct; conflating .data, which stores JS-generated data, with HTML5 attributes, which are attributes of the DOM, is bad.
02:59  conee: i was reading the docs for the datepicker in the UI, was wondering if THIS in onSelect will refer to the associated div rather than an input box
02:59 @JohnResig: snover: how so? it only pulls them in once
02:59  conee: if i'm using it inline
03:00  zjwalden: boy
03:00  zjwalden: bot-t is super useful
03:00  hobs: yep
03:00  snover: JohnResig: Because it’s inconsistent and it conflates data that might be user-generated with data should be guaranteed to be set in JS
03:01  snover: In inconsistency, right now, you can’t do $('#foo').data() and get back all the data attrs
03:01  snover: you get an empty object
03:01 @JohnResig: snover: already fixed
03:01  snover: even if there are data attributes
03:01  b1lly: is there a way to make it so that everytime the person selects an <option> in a <select> field the page reloads, and also keeps the same selection in the field?
03:01 @JohnResig: was fixed the day after 1.4.3 came out, heh - along with a couple other minor fixes
03:02  b1lly: so say I selected 1942 in a drop down list, the page reloads, and automatically sets it back to 1942
03:02  snover: There was also the other issue that ben_alman raised about removeData doesn’t work right
03:02  gf3: JohnResig: HOW CONVENIENT
03:02 @JohnResig: snover: fixed as well
03:02  michael`: Does anyone know how i can fix this issue:  opening a jqueryui dialog, will mess up an id selector, the id selectors works if i don't open a jqueryui dialog
03:02  addyosmani: You have to give JohnResig props. He's quick.
03:02 @JohnResig: or are you saying that it doesn't remove the data- as well?
03:03 @JohnResig: was a bug filed on that issue?
03:03  snover: It can’t remove the data- without breaking other stuff
03:03  snover: ?7210
03:03  bot-t: [#7210] .removeData doesn't remove data when data-* attributes are used ( at the bottom of this ticket)) - http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/7210
03:03  sneakyness: hey snover what do you think of these? http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
03:04 @JohnResig: snover: so it all depends upon your interpretation of how .data() should work - I think it should work more like stylesheets/.css() rather than .attr()
03:05 @JohnResig: doing .css("color", null) will remove the current color of the element - but default it to what's in the stylesheet
03:05 @JohnResig: calling .css("color") will return a value, not null
03:05  b1lly: nm
03:05  snover: I feel like making .data something that pulls automagically from html attributes muddies the water, whereas css always cascades
03:06 --- Vorspire^ is now known as Vorspire
03:06  snover: if you want to get the actual style property from CSS you can still do that by accessing the DOM style property; if you want to guarantee your call to .data does not pull from the HTML attrs, you can’t do that now
03:06  snover: unless you replace jQuery.data with one that doesn’t do that
03:07  sanjayb: hm.. I think a boolean property to the data value like isFromHTML or some nonsense may be hackish, but may help?
03:07 @JohnResig: snover: jQuery.data doesn't access the DOM nodes - only jQuery.fn.data
03:08  snover: oops, jQuery.fn.data then :)
03:09  snover: or I guess then you could call jQuery.data(foo)
03:11  snagnever: hey! is it possible to .animate background color?
03:11  addyosmani: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
03:12  snover: But I’m still not sure why it’s a good idea to “cascade” data lookups
03:12  addyosmani: That should help.
03:12  snagnever: thanks addyosmani!
03:12  addyosmani: np!
03:12  addyosmani: I believe you can also do it using jQuery UI if you wanted.
03:12 @JohnResig: snover: because if we don't then we're going to be setting the values directly on the data- attributes - and that'll have a massive performance penalty
03:14  snover: I feel like it just confuses things, because now you’ve got part of your data store in JS, and you’ve got part of your data store in HTML5, and then you can override the HTML data with the JS data until you delete the JS data and then suddenly it’s reverted back to the HTML5 data, unless jQuery changes to store flags about which data attributes have been removed, but then what if you want the original data back and then you just need to use .attr t
03:15 @JohnResig: you got chopped off
03:15  snover: where did I get chopped?
03:15  addyosmani: .attr t
03:15  snover: .attr to fetch it anyway. It feels like a huge amount of added complexity to a system that doesn’t really need to be there.
03:15  snover: For an app I’m developing, I used the extended data plugin that Paul wrote for a while
03:16  snover: the one that did more-or-less what 1.4.3 does
03:16  Asone: if i do a array[i][j].load() knowing that arra[i][j] content is an image, is the load attached directly to the picture or just to the name of the Array with the variables ?
03:18  snover: I also don’t know what the perf hit is to hit up the DOM every time an undefined property is accessed
03:18 @JohnResig: it's big
03:18 @JohnResig: and that was 100% my biggest concern
03:18 @JohnResig: and why I held off on landing it for so long
03:18  michael`: i found a bug.... after i open a dialog, if i call $("#_datepicker").datepicker("getDate") is returning null
03:18 @JohnResig: but I think that the functionality is important enough to warrant landing it otherwise
03:20  snover: I dunno. I tried it for a while on my app and the benefit, frankly, was really not there.
03:20  snover: It seemed like such a great idea on the surface
03:21  snover: But then I just ended up dumping a bunch of crap into my DOM to get the benefit of the automatic data- attribute retreival and to be able to inspect the data in Firebug
03:21  snover: and the app was worse off for it
03:21  addyosmani: The implementation may just require a little more time to mature. As we/people discover any other areas that need to be fixed or improved upon I'm sure that we'll eventually get to a place where everyone is comfortable enough with the benefits it can offer.
03:22 @JohnResig: I think it's pretty awesome right now, in fact. The tweaks that'll land in 1.4.4 will only help more.
03:22 @JohnResig: .data() (no args) is effectively a more-awesome .dataList now
03:23  addyosmani: It is pretty useful. Is it looking like we might roll out 1.4.4 in about a month or so?
03:24 @JohnResig: yep!
03:24  addyosmani: excellent
03:28  snover: Well, I strongly feel that it’s improperly conflating JS storage and HTML storage, and that the extra library size and perf hit from doing property lookups on the DOM every time undefined comes up isn’t worth it. I also think it’s potentially a security risk since up to this point, .data was guaranteed to return JS-generated data ONLY,
03:28  snover:  and I dunno if this angle has been fully explored. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me since otherwise it wouldn’t be there right now.
03:32 @JohnResig: we "improperly conflate" a lot of things - attributes and dom expandos (.attr("className") and .attr("class")), DOM elements and JavaScript objects ($({}) and $(document.body))
03:32 @JohnResig: the result is certainly /different/ and possibly "less pure" - but is certainly more usable and actually ends up being intuitive
03:37  snover: But, having initially thought it was a good idea, and having tried it for a while, I know that I found the pitfalls to outweigh the benefits.
03:37  snover: I am just waiting for the “I changed a data property but the attribute is still the same in firebug, why?” questions :)
03:37  snover: fuuuu netsplit
03:38  snover: JohnResig: The conflating of dom properties in sizzle’s attribute selector is actually a huge problem, because qSA browsers are behaving differently than browsers that do not have qSA now
03:38  Bisu[Shield]: hey guys. I want to implement ui-tabs and the documtations says i must put the id of the containiner in the href of my tab. I dont want to do what, now I just reference it via a class?
03:38  michael`: has anyone come across this issue... when i open a jquery pop-up dialog... it makes the jquery datepicker not function correctly?
03:38  snover: In other areas it’s less of a problem, like with attr
03:38 --- nagaxen_ is now known as nagaxen
03:39  sanjayb: snover: I think I agree with you on .removeData - it does seem a bit strange that it would revert to the data in DOM, esp. as that's accessible through .attr anyway. hm.
03:39 --- ceej_ is now known as ceej
03:39 --- achiu_ is now known as achiu
03:39 --- RJD22|away is now known as Guest3393
03:39  snover: attr would be a much bigger deal if xhtml had taken off
03:39  coldhead: give it chance, its time will come
03:40 * hobs 1000 years later
03:40 --- Cork is now known as Guest10931
03:41  snover: Well and then there’s also the issue that attributes in the DOM are all strings, so right now it tries to divine out JS primitives
03:41  michael`: is there a good way to debug and step through javascript code?
03:41  snover: FUUU NETSPLIT
03:42  snover: michael`: there are lots of good ways. firebug is one. developer tools in your browser of choice are another.
03:42  snover: And the divining of JS primitives then ends up causing trouble
03:42  snover: like imagine someone that picks a username "true"
03:42  snover: or something lke that
03:42  snover: and the attributes are not JSON serialized
03:44  snover: <div class="comment" data-username="true">blah blah</div> var currentUser = "true"; $('.comment').each(function () { if($(this).data('username') === currentUser) { $(this).addClass("mine"); });
03:44  snover: as an example off the top of my head
03:44  snover: now you’ve got users thinking that .data is a safe way to access properties but it isn’t
03:44  snover: s/properties/attributes
03:45 @JohnResig: snover: I agree on the Sizzle issue, for sure
03:45 @JohnResig: that's something I wanted to fix for 1.4.4
03:46  snover: JohnResig: there’s a bug in, 7128. I think I scheduled it for 1.5 because some of the 1.4.3 blockers were pretty severe
03:46 @JohnResig: snover: k
03:46 @JohnResig: as to the serialization issue, I was going to land a thing to enforce string-ness, if so desired (just using the JSON string syntax
03:46  Vienzzion: hi guys
03:46 @JohnResig: e.g.: data-username='"true"'
03:47  snover: That works as long as you aren’t trying to have interoperability with anything else that is not jQuery that might also happily use those same data attributes, like some microformat
03:48  snover: stupid complex ecosystems :)
03:48  Hierofant: is it okay to ask nubish q's while the Great One is in our presence?
03:49  snover: Hierofant: gopher it.
03:49  Asone: can i use inArray() for a two dimensionnal Array ?
03:49  coldhead: cthulhu is online?
03:50  coldhead: FTAGN RYLEH FTAGN
03:50  snover: Asone: Probably not in the way you want :)
03:50  Hierofant: snover:  In Chrome (not ff or ie), when I click a thumbnail, the image jumps to the bottom of the container before flashing to the next one on mouseup.  why is it moving?  http://bgmezibov.com/film/index2.html
03:50  Asone: what do you mean snover  ?
03:51  snover: Asone: It doesn’t do a “deep” search
03:51  snover: Hierofant: works for me? what ver of chrome are you on?
03:51 @JohnResig: snover: generally I think the 'omg, it's not a string' argument specious - since you could just use .attr() directly and encounter no issues whatsoever
03:51  Asone: m'kay, i guess i'll have to create a for and search each Array contained
03:52  Asone: :(
03:52 @JohnResig: the .removeData() "not removing data" is a bigger issue that should definitely be debated
03:52 @JohnResig: (for example)
03:52  Hierofant: snover, reduce the browser width by about 20%, then hit reload, and try again
03:52  Hierofant: snover -  6.0.472.63
03:52  snover: Hierofant: set vertical-align: top on your images
03:52  Hierofant: okay
03:53  Hierofant: thanks
03:53  Vienzzion: JohnResig: out of subject, how u learned javascript??
03:54 @JohnResig: Vienzzion: self taught
03:54  addyosmani: Many many years ago scientists attempted to clone Crockford.
03:54  addyosmani: John is the result of that experiment
03:54  addyosmani: ;)
03:54  snover: addyosmani: not nice, I am eating ice cream and I nearly ruined my computer
03:54  coldhead:  that's an offensive thing to say, addyosmani
03:54 @JohnResig: haha
03:55  addyosmani: my apologies to all.
03:55  coldhead: leave crockford's moldy old gametes out of it
03:55  addyosmani: haha.
03:55  snover: coldhead: you too.
03:55  coldhead: ugh i can't believe i referred to his gametes
03:55  addyosmani: Crock's getting some hate lately. People didn't want me including him on the top 10 talks this year either for some reason.
03:55  snover: coldhead: go back to the depressive part of your manic-depression
03:55  coldhead: sorry snover
03:55  Vienzzion: JohnResig:really, what book u started
03:55 @JohnResig: are you sure you meant gametes?
03:56  coldhead: yes, little biology joke
03:56  coldhead: microscopes are involved
03:56 * JohnResig shudders
03:56  Hierofant: Hm, Chrome isn't respecting my minimum width declarations
03:56 @JohnResig: Vienzzion: back in the day (haha) there weren't really any good JavaScript books
03:56  Hierofant: snover that got it, thanks
03:56 @JohnResig: the situation is much better now
03:56  coldhead: addyosmani: not wanting him cloned is not the same as hating on him
03:56 @JohnResig: I just read code and tried things myself
03:57  Vienzzion: JohnResig: i'm really curious, cause i didn't read anything about anomyous function in javascript books,until i heard of jquery
03:57  addyosmani: Vienzzion: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html not a bad start at all and it's free.
03:57 @JohnResig: huh, ok
03:58  coldhead: Vienzzion: that's because before jquery all your JS readings had to spend 400 pages on cross browser issues, and everyone was too exhausted for the niceties
03:58  Vienzzion: JohnResig: what i meant is,u programming techniques was like, not in some books back then
03:59 @JohnResig: hmm... best way to relax after 4 days of jQuery conferences/meetings? I think it might be watching competitive Starcraft 2
04:00 --- ezra-g|afk is now known as ezra-g|reallyafk
04:00 @JohnResig: Vienzzion: well - programming techniques are different. I learned those in high school and college
04:00  flintf: I would love to see a sport that combines star-craft and boxing...just sayin
04:01  darcyclarke: JohnResig why not play some Starcraft 2?
04:01  __machine: what's the numerical equivalent to 'slow' animation speed?
04:01 @JohnResig: darcyclarke: I may - but watching it can be a ton of fun :)
04:01  Vienzzion: JohnResig:wow, then u started programming a long time
04:01  snover: JohnResig: The string argument might be specious, but I’m not sure that arguments for trying to automatically convert strings if they look like a type is necessarily a lot better.
04:01 @JohnResig: darcyclarke: (I do play, but I'm really bad)
04:01  coldhead: ?speeds
04:01  bot-t: slow: 600, fast: 200, _default: 400
04:01  coldhead: __machine: ^^
04:02  darcyclarke: JohnResig if you ever want to grab a game just ask
04:03  coldhead: hey ChanServ can you give John some ops? thx bro
04:03  snover: If the solution is to go back to using .attr, then I wonder why extend .data in the first place? Or we could take a page from MS and add a second attribute a la their getAttribute implementation
04:03 @JohnResig: darcyclarke: cool! how good are you?
04:03  snover: I think I’m burnt out talking about it though and you probably are too
04:03  snover: so
04:03  darcyclarke: JohnResig P.S. love going through sizzle trying to find ways to enhance performance (want to contribute to the source jQuery src before then end of the year)
04:03  darcyclarke: JohnResig terrible lol
04:03 @JohnResig: snover: the point is that we can make .data() a better alternative to .attr() - more power, in that regard
04:03 @JohnResig: but yeah, I'm really burnt out too, heh
04:04 @JohnResig: snover: we should chat more later - I agree that there are issues to iron out
04:04  snover: yap
04:04  Vienzzion: JohnResig: at those day, did u just focus on javascript
04:04  snover: JohnResig: I’m trying to reuse #jquery-dev for dev related talks and have #jquery be for support requests, if that sounds reasonable
04:04 @JohnResig: darcyclarke: that'd be great :) I'm "frowny" num: 369
04:04 @JohnResig: snover: ha, it actually does - I never could get members of the dev team to use #jquery-dev
04:05  snover: JohnResig: I think I’ve roped all of the bugs triage people into it at this point
04:05  addyosmani: there were quite a few of us in there yesterday. i think snover has managed to get more people in
04:05  snover: so next step, global domination
04:05  addyosmani: muhahahaha.
04:05 @JohnResig: nice! :)
04:06  darcyclarke: JohnResig seriously just got a make so I could forget about the hassle of getting ANT to work and build on my Windows machine
04:06  darcyclarke: mac*
04:06  addyosmani: We're in need of a single place to discuss stuff and I think Ben mentioned that basecamp was no longer an option
04:06  addyosmani: so -dev works :)
04:09  iszak: heh there's a cup in the office that says "When I grow up I want to be a notorious homosexual" with a kids face on it.
04:10  Rotham: What an adventurous kid

04:11  snover: iszak: that’s mine! can you send it to me?
04:11  iszak: lies!
04:13  snover: oh sorry, is it yours?
04:15  Zeiris: Has anyone tried using jQuery in CoffeeScript?
04:16  Hierofant: Is there a "best practice" browser detect for IE?
04:17  addyosmani: It depends on what you're trying to do really. UA sniffing isn't recommended that highly these days in place of feature detection, but you can always fall back on CSS conditions if you're not doing anything that extensive with JS.
04:17  Hierofant: I need to get window.innerWidth and height
04:18  Hierofant: and there doesn't seem to be a cross-browser way to do that so
04:18  addyosmani: sorry. i've got to brb.
04:21  snover: Hierofant: no cross-browser… wha…?
04:21  snover: Hierofant: $(window).height()
04:21  snover: $(window).width()
04:21  antipop: Hi, I'm trying to modify tehlinks of an iframe so tehy always open in a new window
04:21  antipop: here is the code
04:21  antipop: http://gist.github.com/635646
04:22  antipop: but I can't get it working
04:22  antipop: and I also don't have any errors in the firbug console
04:22  antipop: any help?
04:22  Hierofant: snover - ha.  I had the uses for those two reversed.  Thanks.
04:23  TempTime: can someone tell me why http://pastebin.com/bKzeEcaG doesnt work?  When I remote the stop: part it works just fine, but when I have the stop part in the slider won't display.
04:23  snover: antipop: you can’t modify the content of iframes that violate the same-origin policy.
04:24  antipop: ok, thanks snover
04:24  antipop: so there si not any way to do what I want?
04:24  TempTime: when i remove it I mean, sorry.
04:24  snover: antipop: no
04:25  snover: TempTime: are you forgetting to remove the trailing comma when you remove the stop part?
04:25  antipop: ok, thanks
04:26  TempTime: Sorry, I must not have made that clear. When I remove the stop part and the trailing comma, everything works.  When I have the stop part in the slider disappers.
04:27  snover: oh, I’m sorry, I read your question backwards.
04:27  TempTime: no problem
04:28  snover: TempTime: It would probably beseech you to read the documentation on $.get again because you are not calling it correctly.
04:28  Hierofant: $('window').width() comes up null
04:29  Hierofant: doh, no quotes :D
04:29  TempTime: really?  That's what I susspected.  Is it not supposed to be called in function?  I've read over the doc on .get repeatedly.  I feel like an idiot, lol.
04:30  flintf: snover: I believe  you mean "behoove"
04:30  snover: flintf: you’re right
04:30 * snover gives flintf a gold star for bravery
04:31  snover: oops, I mean, “being a helpful dictionary”
04:31  flintf: yes, years of reading the dictionary finally pay off!
04:31  flintf: totally worth the divorces
04:31  antipop: If I link to a css file in a 3rd party server, and the css has relative links to images, these images will be loaded from my server or from the 3rd party one?
04:32  snover: antipop: relative URLs in CSS are relative to the css file
04:32  coldhead: TempTime, meet temp01
04:32  coldhead: and vice versa
04:32  snover: antipop: unless it is a behavior URL in IE, then it’s relative to the document :\
04:32  snover: but you shouldn’t be using behaviors anyway
04:32  snover: so
04:33 --- gf3 is now known as gf3`
04:33  antipop: mmm whats a behaviour url, gogled does nto help too much http://www.google.com/search?q=behavior+URL&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=mozilla
04:33  SkramX: anyone know a jquery plugin/script that can create a tree view and then export it to JSON?
04:33  antipop: anyway thanks snover
04:34  snover: antipop: If you don’t know, good, and don’t learn. :D
04:34  snover: antipop: And just ignore what I said about behaviors.
04:35  TempTime: man python is a cinch compared to this javascript/web stuff. :-s
04:35  antipop: ok
04:35  victorho: Have a function (http://dpaste.com/260470/) that works fine in chrome, safara, etc. but in IE7 (works fine in IE8) I get an error that says "Expected identifier, string or number, Line 58". If you look at line 58, it's just an end bracket...
04:36  victorho: i'm banging my head on the wall over this one
04:36  flintf: ah
04:36  flintf: the dreaded "hanging comma"
04:36  flintf: IE doesn't take kindly to extra loitering commas
04:36  victorho: flintf: is that comma unnecesary?
04:36  victorho: ohh!!!
04:36  victorho: I HOPE THAT'S IT
04:36  victorho: haha
04:37  victorho: flintf: I love you
04:37  victorho: flintf: haha thanks!!
04:38  flintf: np
04:42  victorho: flintf: alright one more, think it's the same issue. error reads: "Message: Expected identifier, string or number Line: 667 Char: 3 Code: 0 URI: http://192.168.200.42/La-Mar-Apartments/2/"
04:42  hlveheart: strange bug with 1.4.3 with one of the sites i'm constantly on... and the owner isn't planning on doing anything about it, he basically said to stop using firefox
04:42 --- Columcil1e is now known as Columcille
04:42  victorho: flintf: how do I even know where that's coming from?
04:42  victorho: I dont think I even have a js file with 667 lines
04:42  Hierofant: Hey all, I'm having strange browser shots from IE7 and 6.  Does JQuery work on those browsers?
04:42  hlveheart: he uses a cSwitch plugin for users to edit their posts.
04:42  hlveheart: IE 6 + Javascript = Not friends.
04:43  Hierofant: yeah this browser shot is a bunch of information in french on my page :p
04:43  Hierofant: http://api.browsershots.org/png/original/95/95993f263e46aac45636fd5cb92254ef.png
04:43  hlveheart: that's javascript fighting with IE because Microshit coded it poorly.
04:44  flintf: victorho, yea IE is not always great about giving the correct line
04:44  snover: hlveheart: link?
04:44  hlveheart: Huge suggestion to 'fix' that would be to detect IE6/7 users (which isn't many, as IE 8 was rolled out throughout windows update, and IE 9 will be soon as well...) and redirect them to a page saying update their browser.
04:44  hlveheart: snover, one sec.
04:44  snover: hlveheart: provide a description of the problem?
04:45  snover: ?nopm @ hlveheart
04:45  victorho: flintf: ok, gotcha. that just means that line info is incorrect, not that it is pulling from some crazy fle i dont know about
04:45  bot-t: hlveheart, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only private message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.

04:45  hlveheart: okay, okay, jesus.
04:45  hlveheart: no need to spam.
04:45  hlveheart: ;|
04:45  snover: it’s ok, it’s only in the topic and whatever
04:46  snover: hlveheart: so what is the problem exactly?
04:46  snover: I mean, other than, blindly updating to use a newer version of jQuery without performing cursory testing is not a good idea
04:46  snover: (or any software for that matter)
04:46  hlveheart: basically, the website dev changed the site from 1.4..2 to 1.4.3 and now when users click to edit their posts, the text box displays, but isn't functional and the submit button doesn't submit.
04:47  hlveheart: one sec, I'll take a video to show you what i mean
04:47  hlveheart: kind of hard to explain
04:47  flintf: victorho, IIRC jslint will catch the trailing comma problem, maybe try running your scripts through that
04:48  snover: hlveheart: tell them to not upgrade to 1.4.3, sheeeeesh
04:48  victorho: flintf: ok I just googled that. is that something I need to download?
04:48  brettgoulder: any plugin out there better than JQuery UI for sliders?
04:48  snover: hlveheart: http://bugs.jquery.com/report/53
04:48  hlve: Lagged out. fun.
04:48  victorho: flintf: nvm, got it.
04:48  brettgoulder: Google just turns up a bunch of picture scrollers which isn't exactly what I want

05:45  caliber88: well, that works too.
05:46  caliber88: I was wondering if someone could explain the differences between the PubSub concepts and what the jQuery Data-Link plugin offers in terms of data-change handlers.
05:47  caliber88: PubSub seems quite broad on the outset but I noticed similarities in what Data-Link offers.

06:14  coldhead: i am sorrt
06:14  coldhead: sorry*
06:15  no_mind: coldhead, .length returns 1 for single or multiple selection

06:41  danheberden: i got to the top and couldn't move the line to vertical
06:42  danheberden: and it gave me a shit load of the t blocks
06:42  OhaiBBQ: you should be able to until the 500ms setTimout call concretes the block in place

07:02  coldhead: try maybe a:last

08:39  hrwath: plus some extra jobs after work
08:39  iszak: I like to just relax after work, doing things that please me.
08:40  hrwath: if there are any
08:40  hrwath: oh
08:40  iszak: generally learning new things.
08:40  hrwath: I'm saving for an apartment now
08:40  Crum: I watched the movie the social network and I got depressed because I'm 24 and no where. A little jealousy I guess
08:40  hrwath: usually I don't do any extras
08:40  iszak: Crum, not everyone can be the creator of facebook.
08:41  hrwath: real life starts after 40
08:41  hrwath: :)
08:41  iszak: when it's nearly over.
08:41  hrwath: yeah
08:41  iszak: So depressing.
08:41  hobs: nowhere?
08:42  Crum: Of course not everyone can. But everyone wants to be one of the people that win, not the majority that don't
08:42  hrwath: then you just don't matter
08:42  hrwath: ;-)
08:42  hobs: have some respect, you're in #jquery
08:42  hobs: you made it this far
08:42  iszak: real pros use #prototype
08:42  Crum: I mean, on the financial scale and education scale I'm no where
08:42  iszak: that shit is old school.
08:42  hrwath: hm
08:42  Vienzzion: am i missing something here...let me see
08:42  hobs: youre connected to the internet in an irc chatroom about javascript frameworks
08:43  Crum: I have bipolar depression. Does anyone else here?
08:43  hobs: im pretty sure youre in the top couple percent of the world
08:43  hrwath: so you say that developers using jquery are considered to be rich? ;-)
08:43  iszak: Crum, I might have undiagnosed.
08:43  hrwath: and educated
08:43  hobs: I said couple
08:43  iszak: web related courses generally suck.
08:43  iszak: they're already out dated.
08:43  hobs: correct
08:44  iszak: However the foundations of which development is based on isn't a waste of time
08:44  hrwath: yeah
08:44  hrwath: rsses are real school
08:44  hrwath: and practice
08:44  iszak: yeah, as a web developer you've always got to be continue to expand your knowledge, as it only takes 1-2 years and you're behind the curve.
08:45  Vienzzion: i envy those guys at facebook too
08:45  iszak: I don't.
08:45  iszak: that is why often jobs kill you as a developer as you're doing the same crap and never learn new things.
08:45  Vienzzion: iszak: i that depends on indivual themselves
08:45  Crum: Vienzzion that actually made me feel better that you said that
08:45  Vienzzion: think*
08:45  onre: i've got a couple of projects going on that might actually lead somewhere, but i've pretty much accepted that i'm probably not going to be part of anything big :p
08:46  iszak: Vienzzion, and the job of course, some jobs encourage expanding your knowledge.
08:46  Vienzzion: Crum: hence youngest billionaire
08:46  iszak: But my last job was basically creating purely informational sites, day in, day out.
08:46  iszak: I think on an engineering scale Facebook is amazing, on it's uniqueness not so much.
08:47  Crum: if there wasn't a facebook and you had the idea, could you code everything that mark zuckerberg coded? If you could, do you think it would get the same attention as it did at harvard?
08:48  Vienzzion: Crum: it depends on a lot things
08:48  Vienzzion: of*
08:48  Crum: like what? besides whether you had the time to do it or not
08:48  Vienzzion: no..marketing
08:48  Crum: yeah
08:49  Vienzzion: plus other things
08:49  Crum: I guess zuckerberg was at a good spot because at harvard word gets around very fast
08:49  iszak: Crum, I don't believe he coded it all.
08:49  iszak: But yeah, marketing is a massive thing.
08:49  iszak: I mean you can make shit and market it e.g. apple products :P
08:50  addyosmani: That Social Network movie has too many people wanting to make fast money.
08:50  juha_: http://pics.kuvaton.com/bshit/12634787906.gif this is sad and funny at the same time
08:50  Crum: if it was facebook for a community college instead of for harvard at first, I wonder what would have happened. probably it would have died out?
08:50  Crum: I guess that's why you go to harvard. to meet people that know people
08:50  iszak: what the hell is with this lag?
08:50  addyosmani: that is awesome and messed up.
08:50  Crum: addyosmani why do you say that?
08:51  addyosmani: Crum: About the movie?
08:51  addyosmani: My last comment was referring to the picture.
08:51  the-erm: I"m not sure what I'm looking for, but is there a plugin that will allow you to change something like http://whatever.com/page to http://whatever.com/#/page and load the content with an xmlhttprequest?
08:52  falcom: ajax.
08:52  Crum: addyosmani the gif?
08:52  addyosmani: yeah
08:53  the-erm: I know it's called ajax.
08:53  the-erm: Never mind I'll see if I can find it under the ajax section.

09:14  Cork: sushant: cj("#myid ) <--
09:15  Cork: sushant: and your not closing your call to dialog
09:15  Cork: ); is missing
09:15  Cork: actually }); is missing
09:16  sushant: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/277835/ look at this
09:17  sushant: if i remove  $(this).dialog("close");  everything work fine
09:17  Cork: sushant: well your sill calling $("#myid )
09:17  doonie: ;D
09:18  doonie: also if destroy is called before close, is there anything to close really?
09:18  sushant: but not getng whts the prblm with $(this).dialog("close"); ??
09:18  Cork: sushant: btw and how do you expect to close the dialog when you have destroied the object?
09:18  doonie: first!
09:18  doonie: always wanted to do that ;> /me is never first on forums
09:18  sushant: but if i call close before destroy i got same problem
09:19  Cork: sushant: $(this).dialog('close').remove();
09:19  Cork: you don't need to call destroy
09:19  sushant: so any of 2 is fine
09:19  Cork: sushant: close won't destroy it
09:20  Cork: it will only hide the dialog
09:20  sushant: okie
09:20  Cork: sushant: but you normally don't need to call destroy directly
09:21  sushant: so close is always there with destroy
09:21  doonie: no need to destroy a modal
09:21  doonie: specially one you will reuse
09:21  victorho: hey all, if you go to my site (www.awesomestartup.com) and fill out the feedback button on the left, it should submit fine. However, if you click it again right after without refreshing the page, it shows red error bars and disappears as if it were submitting itself a second time on its own
09:21  Cork: sushant: close will hide the dialog, it doesn't EVER run destroy
09:21  victorho: any help would be REALLY appreciated i have no clue what's going on
09:21  Cork: sushant: but if you remove the dom element, the jquery-ui element will be destroyed at the same time
09:22  Cork: so actually $(this).remove() is all you need to do
09:22  sushant: Cork:so i need to do like $(this).dialog('close').remove();

09:29  iszak: why are you trying to do global variables?
09:29  iszak: simply doing foo = "bar"; without any var IIRC sets it as globaL.

09:47  nXqd: a simple question to ask
09:47  nXqd: I have 3 #contents
09:48  nXqd: how can I hide them all
09:48  nXqd: I've tried $('#content').each(function() {$(this).hide();});
09:48  nXqd: but it doesn't work
09:48  Cork: it won't
09:48  nXqd: Cork: why. it just hides the first one
09:48  Cork: $('[id="content"]') is the only thing you can do when your code is broken
09:49  Cork: html doesn't support multible id's in a page
09:49  Cork: nor dom, or js
09:49  nXqd: $('[id="content"]') how about this, what does it do to get through this ?
09:50  Cork: nXqd: it searches through all elements in the page for an element with the attribute id="content"
09:50  nXqd: Cork: Thanks :)
09:50  Cork: that is its really slow compared to #content
09:50  nXqd: so does we have a better solution ?
09:50  Cork: nXqd: if you can you sould fix your html generator to use classes instead
09:51  Cork: class="content"
09:51  Cork: $('.content')
09:51  nXqd: oh thanks :)
09:51  nXqd: That's why we don't have getElementByClass right ?
09:51  nXqd: id is unique and class is mutiple ?
09:51  Cork: we don't
09:51  Cork: you can getElementByClass
09:51  Cork: it will give you an array
09:52  Cork: but ya, classes can exist multible times id is uniq
09:52  Cork: ?mdc getElementByClass
09:52  bot-t: Cork, No results found for 'getElementByClass'.
09:52  Cork: hmm
09:52  nXqd: I remember that we must write our own getElementByClass ? , it wupp now in html5 ?

10:00  doonie: hmm it is
10:01  Cork: doonie: if the client accepts it
10:01  Cork: else no
10:02  doonie: using e.preventDefault(); should be enough right? need to find out why it doesn't fire
10:05  Cork: doonie: yes e.preventDefault() is what you want if the client has the settings to allow to replace/remove it
10:06  doonie: he does :) seems like I had to add a return false on the event 'contextmenu' to get it to fully stop
10:06  Cork: should work $(document.body).contextmenu(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
10:06  Cork: (it's what i do :) )

10:31  quicksilver: aaroninfidel: alert($('#coda-slider').codaSlider().attr(sliderCount));
10:31  aaroninfidel: quicksilver: ok but that doesn't give me the value of the sliderCount
10:33  doonie: what value
10:33  aaroninfidel: doonie: it's the value of the current slide the slider is displaying.
10:34  quicksilver: doonie: I doubt sliderCount is an attribute.
10:34  quicksilver: I doubt you have a variable called sliderCount
10:34  quicksilver: I've never heard of 'codaSlider'; googling for it finds a jQuery plugin which appears to have no useful documentation
10:34  quicksilver: If you can show me some docs which explains what you're trying to do I might be able to help.
10:35  doonie: http://www.ndoherty.biz/demos/coda-slider/2.0/#3
10:35  doonie: aaroninfidel just select the one with the class 'current'
10:36  quicksilver: doonie: oops, my questions were really for aaroninfidel ;)
10:36  doonie: ;p
10:36  quicksilver: nothing on that doc suggests there is something called 'sliderCount'
10:36  dgx: Hey guys. How do I select the first element of the first element of an UL : "UL > 1st li > a" is what I need.
10:36  doonie: $('#coda-slide-id .currenct').parent().className gives you the 'tab1 tab2 or tab3
10:36  aaroninfidel: doonie: I'm trying to write a script so that when you click the left half of the current image it'll go to the previous image, and if you click on the right half of the image it goes to the next image in the slide show.
10:37  aaroninfidel: quicksilver: it's in the code itself.
10:37  doonie: here you go http://www.ndoherty.biz/demos/coda-slider/2.0/#example-3
10:38  doonie: well that wont work actually without recoding :)
10:39  doonie: doing it the way I said with checking the class current sould be one of the easier ways
10:39  quicksilver: aaroninfidel: you can't fetch out some random variable from inside the code using .attr()
10:39  doonie: or check how they did it in their code
10:39  quicksilver: .attr() isn't a magic "grab variables from inside plugin"
10:40  quicksilver: it's for taking HTML (DOM) attributes off DOM nodes.
10:40  aaroninfidel: quicksilver: well, is there a way I can do this?
10:40  quicksilver: doonie is trying quite hard to tell you some ways to do it

10:44  ahfeel: any clue on the purpose of the slice(1) on this exercice:
10:44  ahfeel: http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#44 ?
10:44  ahfeel: kind of make no sense to me.. :/
10:45  doonie: wow I totally missed the new button widget in jq ui :) nice
10:45  Bertrand: slice the array at index of 1 (ie, second postion)
10:45  aaroninfidel: doonie: -_- ok, now I've realized this is a big pain in the ass. xD
10:46  theasta: feel the same. Moreover on slide 45 you only have slice without the argument
10:46  aaroninfidel: doonie: any suggestions on an easy way out?
10:46 * doonie wonders why MS had to get their cdn for jq
10:46  doonie: wont that kill the purpose of everyone only using 1 and thus having it in their cache
10:46  Bertrand: ?eval [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].slice(3)
10:46  bot-t: Bertrand: [4, 5, 6, 7]
10:47  doonie: aaroninfidel think it might be somewhat complicated if you're not familiar with jq :\
10:47  ahfeel: Bertrand: i agree, but here we just want to sort the array to actually get the highest element first
10:47  ahfeel: Bertrand: so with the hell do we slice it ? :|
10:48  aaroninfidel: doonie: yeah, I'm just getting back into it after not using it for 2 years.
10:48  aaroninfidel: doonie: think I should read a book before I try to do this kind of stuff?
10:48  aaroninfidel: doonie: or should I just hack away?
10:49  doonie: depends how quick you learn :) I hate reading books so I would see what others do, learn and hack.. :)

10:51  doonie: ;D
10:52  SugaSlide: hihi all
10:52  doonie: hihihi
10:52  ahfeel: Bertrand: but calling .sort() on the array returned by makeArray() would also work ?
10:53  theasta: Yes it should
10:55  ahfeel: actually calling it on the slice(1) makes the sort not relevant to the initial array.. so i'm really confused
10:55  coldhead: don't left shift my momma
10:55  coldhead: http://www.ratemyvomit.com/?action=ssp&pid=1732
10:57  theasta: the slice(1) would make sense if the first argument has nothing to do with the array to sort and you have to exclude it.. Just my guess.
10:59  ahfeel: theasta: yes that's what i through too, but it's actually not the case

11:01  seutje: wtf
11:02  seutje: is it just me or does codaslider just dump some cruft in the global namespace?
11:02  theasta: have you take a look to the next slide ? It makes more sense to me.
11:03  seutje: and I mean shit like "sliderCount" that's just bound to collide when using multiple sliders on one page
11:05  ahfeel: theasta: still doesnt make sense. I agree that we're making an array out of arguments by using directly the function from the prototype because arguments is actually an array, but in the previous slide why would be slice(1) after making it an array ?
11:06  theasta: ahfeel: I totally agree. We just have to wait for the book :)

11:17  Fichte: with .parent().append('<div></div>')   i just can insert into the parent element
11:17  ahfeel: he left :)
11:17  Fichte: but how can i append it rigth behind the input element?
11:17 --- thebigki_ is now known as thebigkiwi
11:17  Fichte: ?appendafter
11:17  bot-t: Fichte, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
11:18  Bertrand: do you want wrap the div around the input, so you result is <div><input></input></div>
11:18  Bertrand: ?wrapAll
11:18  bot-t: .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
11:18  Fichte: hmmm
11:18  Fichte: good question
11:18  Fichte: xD
11:18  Fichte: i want to write a autocomplete tool
11:19  Fichte: for inputs with class  .helper
11:19  Fichte: i think i will use wrapAll
11:19  Fichte: that sounds good
11:20  Fichte: thx  :)   *cookie 4 bertrand*
11:20  Bertrand: I would probably wrap a div aroun input *and* a div for the response, and then use absolute position
11:21  Fichte: jop

11:25  babbos: var jq = $('<html>hello</html>'); is correct right? i get the html in the jq var...
11:26  Cork: babbos: no its not
11:26  Cork: you'r not allowed to have text in your html tag
11:26  babbos: how to i make a chunk of html string a jq object?
11:26  Cork: only head and body is allowed
11:26  Cork: babbos: $('<div>hello</div>');
11:26  juha_: note to self: don't load 5000 locations to google maps
11:27  babbos: ok
11:28  babbos: and how do i inject a jQ object in the DOM after i have worked with it (added events, manipulated it...) #parent_div is my target... $('#parent_div').html(hq.html()) ?
11:28  Cork: $('body').append($('<div>hello</div>'));
11:28  babbos: and all attached events will follow?
11:28  Cork: so $('#parent_div').append(hq);
11:29  Cork: babbos: you should normally add events after you've attached the element
11:29  babbos: i know, when that is not the case i know that i have to attach all events on a single jq object, and append that to the dom
11:29  Cork: cause some events won't catch untill the element is attached
11:30  babbos: no events should catch untill it's attached :}
11:30  Cork: babbos: i mean they don't exist even after you've attached the element
11:30  babbos: oh
11:30  babbos: thats bad
11:31  Cork: so do var $jq = $('<div>hello</div>'); $('body').append($jq); $jq.click(function() {});
11:31  Cork: it shouldn't change anything graphicaly
11:31  babbos: ok...
11:32  babbos: wanted to make non-dom interfering classes for ui elements / pages...
11:32  babbos: guess they have to dip

11:33  yonk: i tryed .json but dont' work.
11:33  yonk: there is an other way to send via getJSON an array?
11:33  Cork: mammut: use mouseover/mouseout
11:33  Cork: sorry mouseenter/mouseout

11:34  bot-t: mammut, Large List Scroll Results | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/content/large-list-scroll-results
11:36  Cork: yonk: just add the array to the getJSON call
11:36  Cork: yonk: jquery converts it for you
11:36  Cork: yonk: it sends it as params though
11:37  Cork: yonk: if you really want to send it as a json string you need a lib to convet js objects to json strings
11:37  Cork: and jquery doens't include that
11:37  yonk: i'm seeing with firebug and i dont see the array param
11:37  yonk: but arr.join(&); it don't convert array to string?
11:38  Cork: yonk: $.getJSON('url', arr, function(json) {}); ?
11:38  yonk: with firebug i don't see the array
11:38  mino: hi, some visiteurs have a strange bug, when, they click on "Comparatif" ( http://spot-hit.fr/offres.html ) fadeIn fadeOut  put green color on text during translation on firefox on windows, any idea ??
11:39  Cork: yonk: look at the end of the request url
11:39  Cork: yonk: getJSON use get normally
11:39  Cork: yonk: so it will add the varabels to the end of the url
11:39  yonk: $.getJSON(mirror+'?peticion_json', {'datos': arr, 'ok' : true } now i have it
11:40  yonk: and the param datos it's empty
11:40  Cork: uh... what?
11:40  yonk: ?peticion_json&datos=&ok=true
11:40  bot-t: yonk, Couldn't find "peticion_json&datos=&ok=true" in jQuery Docs.
11:40  Cork: yonk: ?peticion_json& isn't valid
11:40  matt1982: if I am looping through a list of inputs by doing: inputs.each(function() { can I get the label after the input? would something like $('label :first').text() work?
11:41  yonk: well i add the string "?peticion_json" to the url to see what is ajax url
11:43  yonk: cork, see this image

11:45  Cork: output: /test?arr%5B%5D=1&arr%5B%5D=2&arr%5B%5D=3&arr%5B%5D=4&arr%5B%5D=5
11:45  yonk: the param arr it's the array. getJSON don't convert the array to string. at least auto
11:45  Cork: yonk: sure it does
11:46  yonk: yes, but my array is arr["title":peny","music":dance"]
11:46  Cork: yonk: thats not an array
11:46  yonk: array with index
11:46  Cork: thats an object
11:46  yonk: mm
11:46  Cork: arrays can't have text indexes
11:46  yonk: ah ok's, sorry i'm novice in js
11:47  Cork: yonk: so $.getJSON('/test', obj);
11:47  yonk: Cork, with this sentence i get it: http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/1864/json.jpg
11:47  Cork: it will convert {"title":peny","music":dance"} to ?title=peny&music=dance
11:48  yonk: are you sure that it works?
11:48  yonk: i tryed with your $.getJSON('/test', {arr:[1,2,3,4,5]}); and yes, it works perfect
11:48  yonk: but with an object, getJSON don't convert to string
11:48  Cork: yonk: can you pastebin your ajax call?
11:49  yonk: yes, sec
11:49  Cork: yonk: it doens't convert it to string, it converts it to parameters
11:49  Cork: yonk: and my example was an object with an array in it
11:49  Cork: to its an example of both
11:49  mammut: http://www.jsfiddle.net/FtjwB/3/  I tried making a hover with mouseenter but it still runs continueously

11:50  yonk: i put some alerts to check that all fields are correct
11:51  Cork: yonk: try this http://pastebin.com/CSFvqxRG
11:51  Cork: as you create a broken array object, that might be why it failes
11:51  matt1982: don't you just love it when some e-comms software doesn't use labels around inputs! makes it really hard to get their values!
11:51  matt1982: of the labels that is
11:52  yonk: ok, give me a second

11:54  owzzz: Hi guys, can someone tell me why my jquery is ineffective on this site http://staging.tenten.sustrans.precedenthost.co.uk/
11:55  yonk: but it's a little obfuscated :S
11:55  Cork: not really
11:55  Cork: its how objects work in params
11:55  owzzz: Jquery is on the page.. and the form_handler.js which does all the jquery is on the page, yet I cant execute the jquery
11:55  Cork: if your server script is a little bit smart it should be able to build the original object from that
11:56  Cork: like ex. php: $_GET['datos']['language_id']
11:56  yonk: aha, perhaps its better to take out the param "datos"
11:56  Cork: yonk: its all up to how you want to group it
11:56  yonk: ok, thank you very much Cork ;)
11:57  Cork: np
11:58  yonk: i hate ajax calls it's so difficult to debug :/
11:58  Cork: owzzz: if you don't absolutly have to; don't put your js in the body
11:58  mino: hi, some visiteurs have a strange bug, when, they click on "Comparatif" ( http://spot-hit.fr/offres.html ) fadeIn fadeOut  put green color on text during translation on firefox on windows, any idea ??
11:59  Cork: mino: most likly a rendering bug
11:59  owzzz: it is in the body
11:59 * babbos is thinking how to access the classe's 'this' if a method is an event listener...
11:59  owzzz: I have tried using firebug console just to run some jquery on the fly
11:59  Cork: owzzz: ya, and i said DON'T...
11:59  owzzz: ahh right o.k..
12:00  Cork: owzzz: if your not forced to put it in the header
12:00  owzzz: Should I put it after the </body> and before the </html> ?
12:00  Cork: inside <head>
12:01  Cork: after your css links
12:01  mino: Cork: i have see on google its firefox confirmed bug, some website propose fix but they don't work on firefox
12:01  Cork: mino: firefox 3.5 & 3.6 has some nasty invalidation bugs in there so called reflow
12:02  Cork: mino: its an ass to work around...
12:02  babbos: ...really how do you do it?
12:02  Cork: work around them?
12:02  Cork: you change the order you add/remove or modify the elements :/
12:03  Cork: or you fiddle with another element to invalidate it
12:04  mino: ok thx Cork, but ... :s
12:05  mino: i dont know how modify animation
12:05  Cork: mino: it shouldn't happen in ff4, and its planed for end of november
12:05  Cork: so... :)
12:06  babbos: ... so how do you tackle needing the 'this' object of your class when your method is an event listener? (so 'this' is the DOM element)
12:06  Cork: babbos: $(this)
12:06  lorique: I have a select i want to empty, but i want to leave the first element, how do i do that using remove()?
12:07  Cork: or if you need it repetedly in the function
12:07  Cork: var $self = $(this);
12:07  babbos: myclass.prototype.clickonlink = function(event){ this.myvar; } ..
12:07  babbos: i need this.myvar, but 'this' is the DOM object
12:07  Cork: ah
12:07  babbos: ...
12:08  mino: Cork: sure, but have 4-5 years to every one go on 4.0 ^^ how i can make a "hack" to make somethink only on firefox 3.5 and 3.6 ??
12:08  Cork: babbos: class members can't be used in events
12:08  babbos: :((( and how can i create reusable ui classes...
12:09  Cork: babbos: you can attach your class to the dom element
12:09  babbos: hmmm
12:09  babbos: if the element is a list (many items)... that would crawl things?
12:09  babbos: ...or store on parent and access that...
12:10  Cork: $(selector).data('my-class', myclass); .click(function() { $(this).data('my-clas').myval });
12:10  mammut: http://www.jsfiddle.net/FtjwB/3/  I tried making a hover with mouseenter but it still runs continueously
12:11  babbos: cork doing that on multiple items ... good/bad/no matter
12:11  babbos: it's only the reference stored so it should be no matter
12:12  Cork: babbos: ya, and it will be removed automatically by jquery when the dom element is removed
12:12  babbos: nice, great help cork!
12:13  seutje: Cork: doesn't that return a string?
12:13  seutje: or have I been serializing my shit for nothing? q.q
12:14  Cork: seutje: no it returnes what ever you added
12:15  Cork: seutje: data isn't attaching an attribute
12:15  Cork: its just keeping a value in jquery related to the dom element
12:15  Cork: so it doesn't even touch the dom element
12:15  seutje: Cork: oh, wasn't it to be implementing the data attributes?
12:15  naimon: hello everyone. I was wondering one thing about jquery mobile. Demo pages also include the original jquery library. Is it required to get mobile version work?
12:16  Cork: seutje: no it was long before the data attribute
12:17  Cork: mammut: your covering the button div with the button_cover, so you can't hover it again
12:17  seutje: Cork: ah, according to the docs, the ability to pass in an object is rather recent
12:17  Cork: seutje: i've been using it from 1.3.2
12:18  Cork: and it worked fine then
12:18  seutje: Cork: I know it was used before the data attribute, but it was to be implementing the data attributes eventually
12:18  seutje: but apparently, u can do <div data-foo="{'some':'object'}"> just fine
12:19  Cork: seutje: ya, but that would most likly cause it to be parsed each time
12:19  Cork: for now at least .data doesn't add it to the dom
12:20  seutje: "The data- attributes are pulled in the first time the data property is accessed and then are no longer accessed or mutated (all data values are then stored internally in jQuery)."
12:21  seutje: ah, looks like u could use objects and such before, but it would completely overwrite it, instead of extending/merging it into the existing
12:21  doonie: anyone ever created a mozilla plugin/edited one? :)
12:21  Cork: doonie: you mean an extension?
12:21  seutje: do greasemonkey scripts count? :D
12:21  arex\: What is the preferred way of dumping an object into text?
12:22  Cork: plugins are a bit hard to edit if you don't have the source that is
12:22  seutje: they're "add-ons" in firefox :P
12:22  Cork: addons == plugins (binary), extensions (xul+js), themes (xul+js)
12:23  seutje: shit's not confusing at all, what r u talking about? -_-
12:24  seutje: arex\: serialize?
12:24  arex\: seutje: oh, sorry, i meant for debugging
12:25  Cork: arex\: console.log? :D
12:25  seutje: oh, yea, just log it
12:25  arex\: hehe, I want a text representation in this case
12:25  arex\: Of course I use console.log normally.
12:26  Cork: arex\: you would have to grab a lib that stringifies the objects (arrays, and what else)
12:26  arex\: I was just wondering if I needed to get a plugin
12:26  Cork: you do
12:26  arex\: Something like http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Dump
12:27  sanjayb: arex\: You could use JSON.stringify(obj) , no ? may not work in older browsers, would need some version of json.js ..
12:29  bartzy: Hi
12:29  bartzy: Is there any field in the DOM where I can save data about a <tr> ?
12:29  arex\: sanjayb: i'll try it, thanks!
12:29  bartzy: I don't want to use $.data
12:30  sanjayb: bartzy: you can still use data-field="" in the DOM and then access it via .attr if you like .. ?
12:30  bartzy: sanjayb: data-field="" is valid HTML4/XHTML ?
12:30  Cork: not html4, but html5
12:31  sanjayb: bartzy: no. its valid Html 5 . and from my experience, seems to work across older browsers as well.
12:31  bartzy: OK, and no other way to do it (valid way :)) ?
12:31  Cork: ya, its only validators that didn't like them
12:31  Cork: bartzy: no
12:31  bartzy: some weird HTML attribute I can use ?
12:31  Cork: thats what the data- is for
12:31  bartzy: OK, so if it's only validators, great.
12:32  bartzy: and I can use it in jquery like $('td[data-field=....]) ?
12:32  Cork: bartzy: if you use the <!doctype html> doctype you sould be fine
12:32  sanjayb: bartzy: i would highly recommend using data- . i've been using it for a while now with no problems .
12:32  Cork: no validation problem or anything
12:32  Cork: bartzy: yes
12:32  bartzy: Cork: I use XHTML doctype, but it's an internal app so I don't really care about validators...
12:32  sanjayb: bartzy: yes. you can also access the value (if using jq 1.4.3) with .data("field")
12:32  bartzy: thanks a lot guys. saved me a bunch of time looking for that attribute.
12:33  Cork: bartzy: are you serving it as application/xhtml+xml?
12:33  bartzy: 1.4.3 is out stable ? cool
12:33  bartzy: Cork: No, why ?
12:33  bartzy: and why should I ?
12:33  Cork: bartzy: if your serving it as text/html it will be read as BROKEN html4 by all browsers
12:33  Cork: not xhtml
12:34  bartzy: sanjayb: .data("field") is faster/better in any way than [data-field=''] ?
12:34  bartzy: Oh
12:34  bartzy: so I should send a content-type header in each page ?
12:34  Wipster: why might you use something like "$(".nav").delegate("a", "click", function() {" over saying something like "$(".nav a").click( function{" or is there a subtle difference I'm not seeing?
12:34  Cork: bartzy: no you have to config the server to send the content type
12:34  Cork: bartzy: meta overide doesn't count
12:34  Asone: Good news everyone, you're reading this in your mind with the professor's voice
12:35  bartzy: Cork: OK... and If I don't use any XML in the page... should I just use html4 and that's it ?
12:35  Cork: bartzy: if your serving it as text/html you are better of serving it as html5
12:35  Cork: its backwards compatible, stable and not as error phrown as xhtml converted to html
12:36  bartzy: Cork: And it will be backwards compatible with older browsers ?
12:36  bartzy: OK
12:36  bartzy: so many websites now serve HTML5 ?
12:36  Cork: sure
12:36  bartzy: OK... and are there any benefits ? (I know of the canvas tag)
12:36  Cork: bartzy: the html5 doctype is minimalistic, it is there to trigger standard modes in old browsers
12:37  yonk: cork, i have a strange problem when i try to get the params of the ajax call
12:37  yonk: http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6442/jsonm.jpg this is the params of my call
12:37  Cork: bartzy: so its actually compatible with any version of all browsers (but some elements doesn't exist)
12:37  sanjayb: bartzy: for one, you can just do <!doctype html> instead of some weirdo long string that no human being has ever been able to remember .. :P
12:37  netben: HTML5 isn't exactly backwards compatible... If you use the new features (canvas) that is
12:37  Cork: netben: the element doesn't exist, but the basic idea of html5 is to stop versoning html
12:37  bartzy: so if I want HTML4/HTML5, I can just use <!doctype html> ?
12:38  Cork: yes
12:38  sanjayb: netben: sure -- but just using the doctype and  then using features based on what browsers you need to support, etc... - this won't "break" in older browsers .
12:38  bartzy: Cork: Versioning HTML ?
12:38 --- seutje is now known as frigginMunch
12:38  yonk: and this is the params after i get with php
12:38  yonk: http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/8786/params.jpg
12:38 --- Killswitch__ is now known as Killswitch
12:38  netben: yayaya, just make it clear that using HTML5 doctype doesnt magically grant canvas/video etc tags and apis ;)
12:38  Cork: bartzy: html2, html2.1, html3, html4, html5
12:39  Cork: html5 will be the last doctype change
12:39  bartzy: oh
12:39  Cork: from there on they will extend it instead of building versions
12:39  bartzy: OK
12:39  bartzy: And do I need to close all tags in HTML5 like XHTML ?
12:39  Cork: as all browsers have to support all the old versions anyway, so there is no point in it
12:39  Cork: bartzy: no
12:39  bartzy: OK so it's regular HTML
12:39  bartzy: thanks a lot :]
12:40  amagee: hey, supposing i have a string that contains html, which contains some <script> tags.  i want to add this to the dom, and execute the scripts in it.  what's the easiest way to do that?
12:40  netben: targetEl.innerHTML = string
12:40  Cork: ?.html @ amagee
12:40  bot-t: amagee, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
12:40  bartzy: Cork: So why XHTML exists ?
12:41  netben: bartzy might as well ask why HTML1 exists ;)
12:41  netben: it's an old version
12:41  Cork: bartzy: it still does, and there is an updated version along side of html5
12:41  bartzy: Yeah but why ? Why not just use HTML ?
12:41  bartzy: It's for mobile or something like that ?
12:41  amagee: Cork: that doesn't seem to execute the scripts.
12:41  Cork: bartzy: but untill you serv the page as application/xhtml+xml there is no point
12:42  bartzy: Cork: Yeah but my question is why should I serve it as xhtml+xml ? When should one do that ?
12:42  Cork: bartzy: IF you do, then xhtml is ALOT nicer to the browser, and ALOT stricter on the developer
12:42  Cork: *designer
12:42  bartzy: Cork: Why it's nicer to the browser ? It's faster ?
12:42  Cork: bartzy: for one, you can't have unclosed tags, or closing them the wrong order
12:43  sanjayb: no - xhtml is still very much around - and you can still use html 5 and serve the page as xml (xhtml 5), which is basically html 5, but as valid xml.
12:43  Cork: bartzy: its ok for the xml parser to say "its not valid, i'm throwing an exception"
12:43  Cork: bartzy: the html parser has to try to fix it
12:43  Cork: and to day thats more then half the size of the parser
12:44  bartzy: So what should I use in my pages ? I don't care serving as text/html nor as application/xhtml+xml... I just want what's best to the users and speed
12:44  Cork: bartzy: if you have ie users you don't really have a choice
12:44  bartzy: IE doesn't support XHTML ? :|
12:44  Cork: nope
12:44  bartzy: wtf...
12:44  bartzy: lol
12:45  sanjayb: bartzy: if you generally code html with closing all tags, etc., I would still recommend serving pages as valid xml - i find the process "cleaner" some-how ..
12:45  Cork: ie9 will though
12:45  sanjayb: Cork: wtf.. really?
12:45  Cork: ya
12:45  bartzy: so application/xhtml+xml will be broken in IE8 and lower ?
12:45  Cork: if you send it as text/html it work in ie, but then its not xhtml
12:45  Cork: bartzy: no worse
12:45  Cork: bartzy: it will be shown as an xml tree
12:45  bartzy: LOL
12:45  sanjayb: how gorgeous
12:46 * sanjayb ponders caring about IE users ...
12:46  bartzy: I have many IE users :( So I guess I'll just use text/html and HTML5
12:46 * sanjayb gives up.
12:46  bartzy: Thanks a lot for the info & help :)
12:46  Cork: good luck :)
12:47  bartzy: <!doctype html> is very clean :)
12:47  Cork: yup :)
12:47  amagee: Cork: sorry, you were right.. it just doesn't run scripts that have syntax errors in them :P
12:47  Cork: i actually miss the strictnes from xhtml bu ok :)
12:47  Cork: amagee: lol
12:47  amagee: would be nice if it would actually, like, say there was a syntax error, rather than doing nothing.. *grumbles*

12:49  purefusion: when I call up jquery in a bookmarklet, how can I ensure that my jquery reliant code executes only when jquery is live/ready?
12:50  purefusion: I'm using an offshoot of this script for the inclusion: http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet
12:51  dabear_: purefusion: <script> elements have a load event
12:51  doonie: so I have a contextmenu, how can it stay when the mouse is in the container but hide when I go outside it.. mouseout on the container doesn't work :)
12:51  purefusion: dabear_: ah, nice
12:52  dabear_: purefusion: obviously you cannot use jquery for adding that load event :p
12:52  purefusion: right :D
12:52  dabear_: s.addEventListener("load", function(){ here ....  }, false);
12:52  purefusion: and that's native js, yes?
12:53  dabear_: ?mdc addeventlistener @ purefusion
12:53  bot-t: purefusion, element.addEventListener - addEventListener registers a single event listener on a single target. The event target may be a single node in a document, the document itself, a window , or an XMLHttpRequest . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener

12:57  Superman_: how to call a specific function from a file with ajax.
12:57  Superman_: what should be the url
12:58  Superman_: I want to call a specific function from functions.php how can i do that with ajax what will be the url??
12:59  hrwath: you can't
12:59  hrwath: you have to call script, which will call the specific function
12:59  Superman_: hmm so we can't stack some common functions
13:00  Superman_: we had to make files for each functionality
13:00  Superman_: so that doesn't make messy code
13:00  Superman_: ??
13:00  hrwath: when you think of AJAX think of URL typed into browser
13:01  hrwath: can you type an URL to call specific function from a script?
13:01  hrwath: no.
13:02  hrwath: unless the script is prepared to handle that e.g. some $_GET or something
13:02  purefusion: dabear_: is that load event on the script element fired after the script element is added, or does it wait until its source is executed?
13:03  dabear_: purefusion: on the load event, jquery will be fully loaded
13:04  purefusion: dabear_: well, what I was thinking of doing was using the simple three-line inclusion method to include a hosted version of the more flexible script detailed here: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/04/better-stronger-safer-jquerify-bookmarklet
13:04  purefusion: but my jquery reliant code would still be part of that three-line inclusion script
13:05  purefusion: so it would have to wait until the included script itself adds jquery to the dom
13:05  Superman_: http://jsfiddle.net/FmEWW/
13:05  Superman_: plz explain this code
13:05  Superman_: especially the part where we have file.php and then some func name
13:05  Superman_: is that possible to call a specific function
13:06  Superman_: with this technique
13:07  purefusion: dabear_: actually, even that script should be using the load event instead of a timeout... now that you brought it up, I see someone suggested that in the comments
13:07  purefusion: I'll have to modify it

14:01  chris_abyi: or is there a better way to handle id references in xml files?

14:36  Mulleteer: does jquery think the .xy is class?
14:37  ner0x: What causes a buttonset to not have rounded borders? It's odd. Sometimes mine will, sometimes they won't. :-/
14:38  ner0x: Looks like they don't when they aren't directly in the main view "IE not in another tab or hidden at first"
14:38  ablomen: Mulleteer, yes, that will look for something that has the id r13b3 and the class xy, keep your id's to a-z 0-9 and _'s
14:39  Mulleteer: thanks ablomen, so I need to use e.g. $("div[id='r13b3.xy']") as workaround in these cases.
14:41  markj: Mulleteer ideally you should use valid id names instead
14:43  Mulleteer: markj, I though that dot '.' is valid in id
14:44  Mulleteer: only restriction is that id or name may not start in number in html4
14:45  markj: you're right it seems, i'd personally never do it though
14:46  chris_abyi: bye then
14:46  markj: you're slowing down your selecting of the element by doing it like that, thats the only thing I would worry about, finding an id will map straight to getElementById which will be faster
14:48  Mulleteer: markj, I maybe could use escape coded query $("#r13b3\\.xy") as workaround with performance penalty?
14:48  Mulleteer: without penalty I mean
14:49  markj: no idea if that would work to be honest, is there a real reason you're using ids like that? id personally replace it with an underscore

15:01  ner0x: How can I select a radio button from jquery?
15:02  quicksilver: $('input[type=radio]') ?
15:02  ner0x: Er.. I mean "click" it.
15:02  quicksilver: .click() ?
15:03  ner0x: That's it? haha
15:03  quicksilver: haha :)
15:03  Jarda: of course you can do .attr('selected', 'selected')
15:03  Jarda: if you want tot
15:03 --- jurica_ is now known as jurica
15:04  Jarda: (that doesn't trigger the click-event)
15:04  ner0x: Yeah, I don't want to trigger the even, just preselect the radio button.
15:04  ner0x: Yeah, none of those work.
15:05  ner0x: Also, the radio button I'm using is also a jQuery-UI button. Not sure if that has anything to do with it.
15:06  erichynds: can you just add the selected="selected" attr to the html
15:07  ner0x: Tried that too, when I hit refresh it stays on the previously selected radio button.
15:07  zjwalden: hmm
15:07  zjwalden: <input selected="selected"> should work for you
15:07  zjwalden: make sure you put it in the input tag of the radio button
15:07  zjwalden: er wait
15:08  zjwalden: checked man
15:08  bartzy: There's no need for type in <script> & <style> in HTML5 ?
15:08  bartzy: and what about browsers that don't support HTML5 ? They too don't need it ?
15:08  zjwalden: you want to add "checked" to the input
15:08  ner0x: Yeah, I figured that.
15:08  zjwalden: sorry, no coffee yet
15:08  l4rk: bartzy: type was never required in any modern browser
15:09  ner0x: checked="checked" still doesn't work.
15:09  zjwalden: yes put checked
15:09  bartzy: l4rk: So why everyone is using it ?
15:09  markj: bartzy you need the script tag you just dont need type
15:09  l4rk: bartzy: because they like to be explicit?
15:09  markj: ignore me
15:09  markj: cant read :)
15:09  quicksilver: ner0x: your browser breaks it on refresh.
15:09  bartzy: l4rk: That's just bytes wasted :|
15:09  bartzy: lol
15:09  l4rk: i guess
15:09  quicksilver: ner0x: on refresh you browser decides to select what is selected before, probably
15:09  markj: validation purposes
15:09  quicksilver: it's annoying.
15:09  ner0x: quicksilver: Yes, very very annoying.
15:09  bartzy: So by "modern" you mean any browser in our age ? IE6 etc ?
15:10  ner0x: quicksilver: firefox does this often?
15:10  quicksilver: I think so.
15:10  l4rk: bartzy: any browser that runs on windows xp :-p
15:10  quicksilver: it definitely does it if you hit Back
15:10  ner0x: quicksilver: Blah. So even if I change it with javascript I can't fix it.
15:10  bartzy: So most of the devs don't use type ? :]
15:10  zjwalden: i'm pretty sure when you refresh on any browser it should reset everything, unless you tell it to resend data? i don't use firefox very often tho so :P
15:10  l4rk: it doesn't matter use it or don't
15:10  bartzy: OK thanks
15:10  l4rk: html5 spec doesn't require it
15:11  bartzy: yeah but what about html4 ?
15:11  l4rk: so you'll validate just fine
15:11  l4rk: probably won't validate, but will still work
15:11  l4rk: so what
15:11  zjwalden: xhtml transitional doesn't require it, i don't think?
15:11  bartzy: html4 will validate too ? Because IE will fall to HTML4 ...
15:11  l4rk: that does't make any sense
15:11  bartzy: why ?
15:11  l4rk: browsers don't fall back to specific html versions
15:12  bartzy: IE doesn't support HTML5.. so it will use HTML4. It requires type ?
15:12  l4rk: bartzy: again you aren't making any sense
15:12  l4rk: its not all or nothing
15:12  l4rk: IE 6 supports many HTML5 features
15:12  zjwalden: bartzy, it should use the doctype you provide
15:12  bartzy: OK, if I'm using <!doctype html>
15:13  l4rk: that doesn't change anything other than putting the browser in standards mode
15:13  bartzy: an HTML4 validator will pass a <script> tag with no type ?
15:13  erichynds: heh
15:13  l4rk: has literally nothing to do with "enabling" html5
15:13  zjwalden: good luck l4rk =) off to work gentlemen, have a great day!
15:13  ner0x: quicksilver: Wow that is really really annoying.
15:14  exa: Hi! I try to toggle some some things but my code doesn't work =(   http://jsfiddle.net/9m7Kn/
15:15  bartzy: Why should I want to be validated ? If the document doesn't validate, why do I care ? :|

15:18  ajavid: so long as we get keynotes.
15:28  acdameli: I have a generic javascript question but don't know where else to post it. Aaaaanyway, is there a convenient way to get the uri for the script file that's executing? IE) HTML: <html><body><script src="/my/script.js?v=1234"></script> //// then inside script.js somewhere I need to find out what the v param is
15:28  acdameli: ... without having to parse the DOM looking for "myself" as it were.
15:29  Jonz: acdameli, you could name space all thefunctions inside that script
15:29  Jonz: inside every script on your page
15:29  Jonz: that's kind of a hack, but what you're asking to do is a pretty hacky thing ;)
15:29  exa: What's wrong with this simple code? =(   http://jsfiddle.net/9m7Kn/15/
15:30  acdameli: Jonz, I'm not actually looking for which script is executing, I actually need to know what the param is that was used to load the js file. It's regarding versioning.
15:31  acdameli: exa, h2.trigger's .next('.toggle_container') returns an empty set.
15:31  Brodingo: exa toggle_container is not next to the h2
15:31  Dykotomee: exa: use .parent().next()
15:31  acdameli: try $(this).closest('header').next(...)
15:32  Jonz: acdameli the only thing I can think of it is to add the version as a variable inside the javascript
15:32  Dykotomee: Also, the first click will simply show, not slideUp.
15:32  acdameli: exa, http://jsfiddle.net/9m7Kn/18/
15:32  Dykotomee: You might want to try .slideDown() after the .hide().
15:32  exa: it work's!   thanks !! =)
15:32  acdameli: Jonz, yeah, I was hoping to avoid that as our existing versioning tool doesn't provide that functionality.
15:33  Dykotomee: Nope, slideDown doesn't work...
15:33  Dykotomee: acdameli: How would you avoid that first click's misbehavior?
15:34  acdameli: Dykotomee, which misbehavious? sorry I don't see a prob.
15:35  Dykotomee: On the first click, FF doesn't animate, it only .show()s.
15:35  Dykotomee: After that, animation is fine.
15:35  Yan_Nick: hey guys, how can I fix that? http://pastebin.com/65CG57R9
15:36  Dykotomee: Yan_Nick: line 3 is missing a semicolon.
15:36  acdameli: Dykotomee, use chrome? lol Or in FF use a div instead of a section
15:36  Dykotomee: Yan_Nick: Oh, wait, what are you trying to do?
15:37  acdameli: Dykotomee, apparently FF has an issue with animating section. I replaced the section class="toggle_container" with div class="toggle_container" and it worked.
15:37  bot-t: Yan_Nick, http://pastebin.com/x9tWTkgu
15:37  Dykotomee: http://pastebin.com/UsBZSBWG
15:37  Dykotomee: Try that.
15:38  Dykotomee: (I think)
15:38  Dykotomee: acdameli: Cool, thanks.
15:38  ajpiano: acdameli: are you opposed to putting an id on the script tag and parsing it that way
15:39  ajpiano: afaik there's no way to find out what you want to find out from inside of the script itself
15:39  acdameli: ajpiano, i'd really rather do it more elegantly. I'd like to avoid having to search for itself. I just assumed there was a self-reference or something similar to document.location
15:40  ajpiano: acdameli: i'm sure you are familiar with the caveats of assumption
15:40  ajpiano: scripts don't really know anything about their position in the dom
15:43  ajpiano: whereas if you just put an id on the script tag, you could the entire job done in one line

16:00  Iszak: Dykotomee, very interesting.
16:01  Dykotomee: Basically, there is always more than one way to do it in JS.
16:01  ajpiano: Northwoods: $("input[name=e_from]").val("abc")
16:01  Dykotomee: The question is, why would you want to if you found a perfectly good way to do it?
16:01  Iszak: Dykotomee, just to make that clear - i wasn't being sarcastic.
16:01  Dykotomee: Yeah, got it. :)
16:01  Iszak: Personally I prefer only one way to do it.
16:02  Iszak: Unless there are reasons for the other way.
16:02  Dykotomee: Yeah, makes things easier to read /and/ write.
16:02  Iszak: I mean why do we need print AND echo, sure you can put print in a condition, but COME ON.
16:02  Dykotomee: Of course, there are exceptions to everything, but that's just a good general rule of thumb.

16:10  Northwoods: erichynds: looks cool , is it necessary that we do .find
16:10  erichynds: well, you need to traverse down to the input from the form
16:10  Northwoods: $(this.form).("input[name=e_from]").val('abc');
16:10  Iszak: Dykotomee, that article seemed very pro-rails but that said you would know that there are more than one gem to do something in rails.
16:10  erichynds: $("[name=foo]", this.form), but it's the same as a find()
16:11  Dykotomee: Iszak: Seems strange, considering they specifically talked about a CoC paradigm. Almost the exact opposite from "more than one gem."
16:12 --- seutje is now known as frigginSmoke
16:12  Iszak: Dykotomee, that's really specific to the framework however say for authentication I'm sure there's more than one gem out there that provides authentication and even access control.
16:12  Dykotomee: Well, that's probably true for all languages.
16:12  Iszak: there's also IIRC two email validation gems, sure it's not a lot but what happens when people create their own that they feel is better, you get the same situation like you do with the apple store and too many farting apps.
16:13  HerrBlume: hello i have an dom element and want to use jquery to query it again, how do i do this?
16:13  Iszak: "query it"?
16:13  Iszak: define what you mean query it.
16:14  Dykotomee: Iszak: $($('#myId')). :P
16:14  Iszak: soew
16:14  HerrBlume: $('someClass).each(function() { var dom = this; /* now i want to query for parent, then  the last child  */ });
16:15  Iszak: ew
16:15  HerrBlume: ?
16:15  Iszak: $('.someClass').parent().children(':last')
16:15  Iszak: you should use an element selector on that class too e.g. div.someClass
16:15  Iszak: you can also specify a element selector for the parent, but not necessary.
16:15  HerrBlume: cool, thank you

16:18  Iszak: You should use it as a guide however if there is some say IE specific tag you need e.g. allow transparency on an iframe which breaks validation, so be it.
16:18  Jonz: basically, take some pride in your work
16:19  serio: The only reason I ever care to make a site validate with W3C validator is if I want to say "hey, check it out, my site validates"

17:10  Gidgidonihah: how is it that jqueryUI has a higher version number than jquery. That's just silliness.
17:11  serio: How is it "silliness"?
17:11  serio: they're two different libraries, independant from one another
17:11  serio: an update to jQueryUI doesn't constitute an update to jQuery core.
17:12 @JohnResig: Gidgidonihah: jQuery UI went from 1.0 to 1.5 skipping everything inbetween
17:12  VonLipwig: I am having the same problem. Let me post it up.
17:13  acdameli: VonLipwig, you probably want to bind that handler in the callback from the original slideDown animation function.
17:15  VonLipwig: Sorry I don't understand. This is what I have. The problem is pretty simple. The event is trigger at the same time as the event to open the div so it opens and closes instantly. http://jsfiddle.net/2c5Ww/
17:15  acdameli: VonLipwig, like so: $('#myDiv').slideDown('slow', function() {$(body).once('click', function() { $('#myDiv').slideUp(); })});... hope my parens are right.
17:15  serio: JohnResig, why the jump from 1.0 -> 1.5?
17:16  dilvie: hi
17:16  VonLipwig: Unfortunately I am not using slidedown, I using a straight up click to appear function.
17:16  acdameli: VonLipwig, once = one...
17:16  dilvie: I have a completely off topic question.
17:16  acdameli: So you want to show it then hide it on the next click?
17:16  VonLipwig: No, I want to hide it if you click anywhere but the div
17:17  VonLipwig: if you click on the div other actions happen
17:17  dilvie: well, maybe I don't.
17:17  acdameli: VonLipwig: $('#myDiv').bind('click', function() { $(this).show(); $(this).one('click', function() {$(this).hide();})}); ?
17:17  acdameli: oh. lol my bad
17:18  agib: can anyone help me figure out why find("*[data-hover-on]") isn't working in my mouseneter event? http://gist.github.com/636611
17:19  VonLipwig: What I have almost works, I just need the click event to kick in from the 'next' click. Not the initial click to open the div. http://jsfiddle.net/2c5Ww/
17:19  acdameli: $('#myDiv').bind('click', function() {$(this).show(); $(document).one('click', function() { // determine if you are clicking inside your div or not and either $('#myDiv').hide() or not as appropriate'... <parens here>
17:19  VonLipwig: I will give that a go
17:19  Dykotomee: dilvie: Just ask.
17:20  dilvie: Dykotomee:
17:20  egrouse: http://pastebin.com/SCZNwT96 can you see anything wrong with this? nothing is happening on mouseover
17:20  Dykotomee: .mouseOver()?
17:20  dilvie: No worries. I'm still trying to figure out what the question is. =)
17:20  Dykotomee: dilvie: :)
17:20  egrouse: the docs state mouseover
17:20  Dykotomee: Hmm...
17:21  destinydriven: whats the easiest way to remove <label for="SomeId">someField</label> from the dom without using .contains() ?
17:21  Dykotomee: Paste HTML?
17:21  egrouse: with mouseOver i get an error
17:21  egrouse: sec
17:21  Dykotomee: destinydriven: $('#SomeId').remove();
17:21  Dykotomee: (I believe)
17:21  agib: whoa, $.fn.find() doesn't like html attributes that don't have values....
17:21  acdameli: egrouse, do you now want mouseenter?
17:21  dilvie: destinydriven:  $('#SomeId').detach() if you want to preserve the element and just pull it out of the DOM.
17:21  agib: but $ doesn't care
17:22  acdameli: *now = not
17:22  egrouse: http://pastebin.com/t4Eten1x html
17:22  egrouse: mouseenter doesnt work either
17:22  destinydriven: doing it that way removes all the labels on the form. I only want to remove one
17:22  quicksilver: SomeID isn't an ID in destinydriven's HTML.
17:23  acdameli: egrouse, what's the html?
17:23  egrouse: just pasted it
17:23  quicksilver: destinydriven: $('label[for=SomeId]').remove() perhaps?
17:23  destinydriven: thanks quicksilver
17:23  acdameli: egrouse, I only see your script, not the html.
17:23  webspiderch: hello to all
17:23  egrouse: http://pastebin.com/t4Eten1x html
17:23  webspiderch: does anybody know accordion settings ?
17:23  Bertrand: egrouse: works for me    http://www.jsfiddle.net/bert/g2GrH/
17:23  webspiderch: how can I set it up with all the tab closed at start ?
17:24  egrouse: nice
17:24  Dykotomee: quicksilver: Ooh, right, good catch.
17:24  Bertrand: ^^^^ not for egrouse
17:24  destinydriven: quicksilver: thanks, that works fine
17:24  agib: does anyone know if $.fn.find() is supposed to work on html attributes without values; e.g.: <span data-hover-on>hello</span>?

21:29  atula: few. for a second I thought  I've missed a few releases of jq

21:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: is there anyway to have locally/privatly scoped values that are accessable from functions in the object's prototype?
21:29  atula: destinydriven: check if $(this) is what you think it is
21:29  nuandy: bartzy: I don't think you can with jQuery, you need a server side language to do that
21:30  bartzy: No way to do it client side ?
21:30  destinydriven: ajpiano: I can't get this live anytime soon though
21:30  ajpiano: cool, well my psychic powers aren't going online anytime soon either
21:30  nuandy: bartzy: I don't believe so
21:30  destinydriven: ajpiano: :)
21:31  atula: bartzy: you could grab the image src and create  a temporary image .. $('<img src="' + img_rsc + '" />').width() ?
21:31  my_haz: vrtigo: yeah that seems right $("#box option:selected").text() ?
21:31  my_haz: thanks
21:31  atula: again.. haven't tested it... but yah, just a thought
21:31  vrtigo: yep looks fine
21:32  vrtigo: if you wanted to be entirely accurate, $("#box>option:selected").text()
21:32  destinydriven: atula: yeah, $(this) doesn't seem to be what I think it is for real
21:32  atula: destinydriven: there ya go... first get the correct $(this)... then we'll talk heh
21:32  destinydriven: yeah
21:33  bartzy: atula: No that's not so good for me.. thanks :p
21:33  my_haz: one last silly question how do i make it so that when someone presses "enter" on a <input type="text"> it doesn't submit the form?
21:34  Dykotomee: my_haz: $('input[type=text]').bind('keypress', function(e) { if (e.keyCode == 13) return false; });
21:34  danheberden: vrtigo: $('#box').children(':selected') would be faster in that case
21:35 --- jalama_ is now known as jalama
21:35  atula: bartzy: not so good as in not working?  perhaps place the image on the dom somewhere off page to calculate the dimensions... or you could insert it into a data-... <img src="#" style="width:x;height:y" data-realstuff="{width:455,height:123}" />  and use $('imgselector').data('realstuff') to get them
21:35  devinrolsen: Hey, I need to traverse up to my parents previous sibling... is there a quicker way write this? $j(this).parent().prev('.parentPrevSibling') ???
21:35  devinrolsen: or that about right?
21:35  Dykotomee: $(this).parent().prev()
21:36  serio: if the item is classed you can just use .closest
21:36  devinrolsen: ok same thing.. I only added '.parentPrevSibling' to ensure that if there are any markup between the parent and this sibling it would skip it
21:36  Dykotomee: closest will grab siblings?
21:37  Dykotomee: ?closest
21:37  bot-t: .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
21:37  serio: no wait
21:37  serio: im wrong
21:37  danheberden: maybe incestious siblings
21:37  Dykotomee: Good, I was starting to sweat.
21:37  Dykotomee: That would've been a lot of recoding.
21:38  danheberden: you was thinking closest went 'up' like prevAll
21:40  macmartine: How do you remove all bindings on an object?

22:26  pifantastic: monstordh: are you sure that it should do something?  It binding events so it shouldnt do anything
22:26 +dabear_: how can that be!??
22:26  eTiger13: dabear_: i didnt know the js assignment for it, thats all
22:26  akahn: what's faster, ':input' or 'input'?
22:26  ajpiano: the latter
22:26  pifantastic: monstordh: you can just do function jhover() { yada yada };
22:26  ajpiano: monstordh, yes, you can create a function by doing var foo = function() { };  or function foo() { }
22:26  monstordh: pifantastic: i'm wanting it to add the class "jhover" to #recSwap when I hover
22:26  akahn: ajpiano: thanks
22:26 +dabear_: eTiger13: nearly every single language I know uses % for modulo. except for vb, which uses the "mod" keyword
22:26  pifantastic: monstordh: remove the single quotes arount this
22:27  monstordh: pifantastic: duh
22:27  pifantastic: $(this) NOT $('this')
22:27  monstordh: THANKS!
22:27  monstordh: pifantastic: totally missed tht
22:27  eTiger13: dabear_: ive actually not had to do it before. and css uses :even and :odd. was kind of hoping for something like that but this works just as easily
22:27  monstordh: pifantastic: wow... worked like a charm. :-) Thanks!
22:27  pifantastic: monstordh: but this also works: http://pastebin.com/Rwe5z2fM
22:27 +dabear_: ?thisnotthis
22:27  bot-t: $(this) NOT $('this')
22:28  monstordh: pifantastic: thanks for the help, guys! (and gals?)
22:28  eggsby: girls? any girls itc? hello?
22:29 * danheberden worries what kind of weird internet behaviour that question can lead to
22:29  Brodingo: i like to pick up chicks in IRC
22:29 +dabear_: the only girls around are male cops
22:30  destinydriven: haha
22:30 * unruthless agrees with danheberden, this question is going nowhere good
22:31  coldhead: konichiwa, ninjas
22:31  danheberden: ¡hola!
22:31 +dabear_: holai!
22:34  destinydriven: how do you pass data to a ui modal dialog?
22:34  akahn: What would be a smarter way to get the first non-empty input value? http://pastie.org/1236464
22:34  ajpiano: destinydriven: what do you mean by "pass data"
22:34  akahn: I just want to get a string value out
22:34  destinydriven: ajpiano: I wanna pass the table row index of the button which was clicked to trigger the dialog
22:35 +dabear_: akahn: that thing you have there is msart enough, and fast
22:35 +dabear_: but you can do [value!='']
22:35  destinydriven: ajpiano: got a table which uses modal form to edit table data
22:35  akahn: dabear_: cool, i think that would end up being more readable/expressive
22:35  ajpiano: destinydriven: how do you anticipate that the dialog would "Accept" your parametr
22:36  ajpiano: destinydriven: you could stick the index value in the .data() of the element you have the dialog on
22:36  destinydriven: ajpiano: it would only be the table row index
22:36  destinydriven: ahh ok
22:36  danheberden: $('#dialog').giveDrinks().slipRoofies().passData();
22:36  sisyphus_: gah. I hate having to nest elements when I deem it not necessary. ;(
22:36  destinydriven: thanks guys
22:36  destinydriven:  later

23:01  zef88: Hello can somebody please tell me why isnt this small code working? http://pastebin.com/x57mYG6L
23:01  danheberden: its too small
23:01  danheberden: increase your fontsize
23:01  sean`: INCREASE
23:02  danheberden: toArray() is no  longer a jquery object
23:02  zef88: hmm
23:02  zef88: :o
23:02  danheberden: so calling focus on a non-jquery thingy-ma-jig
23:02  zef88: how can I switch from jquery objects to normal DOM objects
23:02  zef88: and backwards?
23:03  zef88: i used to array so I could use .pop()
23:03  danheberden: you have to re-jquerify them
23:03  danheberden: zef88: use slice
23:03  zef88: is slice jqueryble?
23:03  danheberden: slice(0, $thingy.length - 2)
23:03  danheberden: ?slice
23:03  bot-t: .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/

23:04  zef88: thanks
23:04  zef88: one more question..
23:04  zef88: how do i jqueryfy things?
23:04  danheberden: do you just want the last one ze?
23:04  zef88: or dejqueryfy them
23:04  danheberden: zef88 ^^?
23:04  danheberden: or all before that
23:04  zef88: no i want all but the last one
23:04  danheberden: ?get @ zef88
23:04  bot-t: zef88, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

23:13  subsume: jedmund, don't ask to ask. just ask.

23:14  jedmund: If you play with the member:red dropdown on http://dev.getfoundation.com/ui/finput.php the button invokes both dropdowns and not just one
23:14  jedmund: http://pastey.net/141854 this is the code i'm using.  think i have to use .each() but I'm not sure if thats right, and if so, how

23:15  eTiger13: danheberden: mine is better

23:16  eTiger13: subsume: just look at how some other widgets are doing it and copy them on it
23:16  danheberden: we need to merge ours
23:16  danheberden: eTiger, put mine with yours
23:16  asfahaan: http://asfahaan.tasmanit.com/mtgslideshow/index.html  i have made this one based on tutorial i found on the web
23:16  danheberden: ( i wasn't paying attention to what focus did)
23:16  zef88: thanks guys
23:16  zef88: however i believe .show changes display atribute on css
23:17  asfahaan: tried to integrate with CMSMS template and its not working. can someone help me with the css .. whr i am going wrong http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/
23:17  zef88: not visibility
23:17  zef88: and i need that div's space reserved
23:17  danheberden: zef88: correct
23:17  danheberden: you can also .css('opacity', 0)
23:17  danheberden: or .attr('visibility', 'hidden')
23:17  eTiger13: jedimind:  lines 43 and 59 remove the .not(this) part
23:18  danheberden: wait, not .css ('vis
23:18  danheberden: *no, css
23:18  eTiger13: danheberden: thats what i meant, parts of mine were better than yours
23:19  zef88: :O
23:19  jedimind: eTiger13, what?
23:19  zef88: but i still dont understand why didnt mine work?
23:19  eTiger13: zef88: because it was bad?
23:19  zef88: hahaha
23:19  zef88: yes I suppose so
23:19  zef88: ;(
23:19  zef88: why didnt $.each worked
23:19  subsume: eTiger13, but is it possible without being able to control the client server's html?
23:19  eTiger13: jedimind:  sorry, that was for jedmund
23:20  jedimind: jedmund, change your nick, i was here first
23:20  jedimind: :)
23:20  eTiger13: jedmund:  lines 43 and 59 remove the .not(this) part
23:20  danheberden: zef88: you needed to do $(this).focus in your each but that's unneccessary.. you can just add .focus
23:20  jedmund: hmm okay
23:20  eTiger13: eternicode:  change your nick, i was here first ;)
23:20  danheberden: no need to use each because focus will be added tl all elements in the colleciton
23:20  jedmund: @ eTiger13
23:20  zef88: oh really?
23:20  asfahaan: can someone help me with my jquery slider. it doesnt display http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/
23:20  eternicode: :P
23:20  zef88: yes I'd read about implicit iteration
23:21  zef88: but didnt know that applied for events
23:21  zef88: like that
23:21  jedmund: eTiger13: removed, but both menus still open
23:21  OhaiBBQ: hey everyone
23:21  bot-t: (1 hour 2 mins 20 secs ago) <eTiger13> tell OhaiBBQ you followed me on twitter
23:21  OhaiBBQ: eTiger13: yeah but what do you mean you didn't think that was my real name?
23:21  asfahaan: i dont mind paying someone if you can make my slider work
23:21  asfahaan: PM
23:22  eTiger13: jedmund: that was just one tip. i really have no idea what your script is trying to do since its so complicated when i dont think it needs 9/10s of that code
23:22  jedmund: oh really? hmm
23:22  eTiger13: OhaiBBQ: i never knew your name before
23:22  jedmund: eTiger13: did you look at the page with the demos?
23:22  ProLoser: has anyone here used lazyloader before?
23:22  jedmund: eTiger13: http://dev.getfoundation.com/ui/finput.php click the button for one of the red menus
23:24  eTiger13: asfahaan: how is it supposed to work? what is supposed to be doing something?
23:24  eTiger13: jedmund: nope.
23:24  asfahaan: eTiger13 here is the working solution which i wanted to integrate into the main site: http://asfahaan.tasmanit.com/mtgslideshow/index.html
23:24  jedmund: eTiger13: nothing happens? both menus should open, but i only want the clickedm enu to open
23:25  asfahaan: eTiger13 i have uploaded all the js, css, and images onto the cms driven website
23:26  eTiger13: jedmund: its because you are telling all elements with the class 'fsselect_dropdown' to show, not the specific one
23:26  Jezek: im trying to get the current index of the element in relation to its sibilings, i seem to be having problems though.. anyone know how to do this?
23:26  Jezek: it keeps returning -1
23:26  asfahaan: when i inspect using firebug. the <a href=#"> under <div id="slide-runner"> are greyed out (hidden)
23:26  jedmund: eTiger13: how can i target the specific one? say every UI element like that is in a class "foo", how do i make it not target everything and only a specific one?
23:27  eTiger13: jedmund:  sSelShowDropdown( $(this) );   function bSelShowDropdown(ele) { ele.next('.fbselect_dropdown').show(); }
23:28  jedmund: ah
23:28  jedmund: okay
23:28  jedmund: i'll give that a shot
23:28  jedmund: thank you!!
23:28  eTiger13: asfahaan: none of that code was in the first link you sent
23:29  asfahaan: the blue header part is where i want the slider to appear
23:29  eTiger13: asfahaan: well you have no jquery on that page, no script.js or anything that would make a slider work. you do have mootools though
23:29  eTiger13: asfahaan: have you even looked at whats loading on the page in firebug? look on the net tab for jquery.js
23:29  asfahaan: Hmm okay. eTiger13 I will recall the js then
23:30  eTiger13: ?paste @ Jezek
23:30  bot-t: Jezek, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org

23:46  khinester: with <td colspan="2" id="listen"><a href="#" onclick="play('sound.wav')">Listen</a></td>

23:51  khinester: eTiger13: thanks, what will be a better way?
23:51  patrickgamer: Here's why I want to store a function in data: http://jsfiddle.net/ReCxJ/6/
23:51  pifantastic: patrickgamer: jQuery does that internally for events
23:52  eTiger13: khinester: first, get rid of the onclick. you are using jquery now, use that instead
23:52  patrickgamer: pifantastic: I'm not sure I'm following
23:53  pifantastic: patrickgamer: your element has an attr named click?
23:53  patrickgamer: right now, yes
23:53  pifantastic: patrickgamer: do you mean onclick?
23:53  patrickgamer: pifantastic: well, right now I'm trying to use click as a proof of concept, but I'm doing it for SharePoint which uses an attribute called onMenuClick
23:54  patrickgamer: pifantastic: so i'm just trying to get it to work with standard attributes first, then I'll work on integrating
23:54  pifantastic: patrickgamer: face() isnt going to work, you're going to need to *shudder* eval();
23:54  eTiger13: khinester  $('#listen').html().append('<button />).val('listen').click(play);
23:54  khinester: eTiger13: great thanks
23:56  asfahaan: is this correct - http://wipsite.medtechglobal.com/uploads/js/scripts.js ?
23:56  asfahaan: regarding the $.noConflict();
23:57  pifantastic: asfahaan: $jQuery is probably not defined
23:57  asfahaan: how do i define it please!
23:57  pifantastic: you probably mean just jQuery
