00:07  RTPMatt: there is nothing wrong with return false IF you understand what it does
00:08 --- danisoftware_ is now known as danisoftware
00:08  danheberden: like i said, nothing wrong
00:09  danheberden: e.preventDefault(); however is more expressive and can be placed at the top of the callback
00:09  Lumpio-: Who decides what's "best prectice" anyways
00:09  danheberden: for those kind of situations
00:09  Lumpio-: practice*
00:09  RTPMatt: Your boss
00:09  danisoftware: i think i found the solution

00:13  RTPMatt: karega you can probably make beforeSend change it for you
00:13 @ajpiano: karega: i think you use the beforeSend callback to cal
00:14 @ajpiano: ^^
00:14 @ajpiano: karega: you can also change the dataType to set the accept header as well
00:14 @ajpiano: apparently
00:16  kenno: http://jsbin.com/eluna3/10/edit it doesn't work on my site, If I mouseover the item, then it just adds the display:none to my already hidden div :/
00:17  karega: ajpiano, is there documentation to support that?

00:18  bot-t: [#6549]  (closed enhancement: worksforme) - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6549

00:30  snufft: anyone have experience with a jquery gallery that works in ie6?
00:30  snufft: i'm chasing just the fade between images, left/right arrow and a few numbers across the bottom
00:30  snufft: the usual gallery setup :P
00:31  ProLoser|Work: i'm having trouble trying to find the animateclass docs
00:31  NET_: ok, so i tried to use <script src="myscript.js" id="something">{siteid:1}</script>  and in myscript i run siteid= $.parseJSON($('#something').text());   firefox and safari and opera all work with that.
00:31  NET_: but IE didn't like it
00:32  ProLoser|Work: how do i animateClass?
00:32  RomD: ProLoser|Work: that's in the jquery-ui package
00:32  RomD: ?g jquery ui @ ProLoser|Work
00:32  bot-t: ProLoser|Work, jQuery UI - Home - http://jqueryui.com/
00:32  ProLoser|Work: right found it
00:32  ProLoser|Work: wasn't sure if it was the core or ui
00:32  ProLoser|Work: thanks
00:32  RomD: np
00:33  NET_: then i tried <script>var script_id = 2;</script><script>console.log(site_id);</script>
00:33  NET_: site_id isn't set.
00:33  RTPMatt: NET_: that is pretty creative, why not just define your variable about your script tage?  then you will be able to access it in the script?
00:33  RTPMatt: *above
00:33  ProLoser|Work: question 2: does children select grandchildren also? if i do .children()
00:34  ProLoser|Work: or is it parent > children
00:34  RomD: .find()
00:34  NET_: RTPMatt: well, i want to pass an id in with the snippet on the 3rd party site.
00:35  NET_: RTPMatt: so the script i include i don't want to edit, should be the same js file for all sites.
00:35  RTPMatt: NET: is your goal just to avoid creating any global variables?
00:35  NET_: RTPMatt: well, i've given up on that absolute requirement
00:35  RomD: NET_: check your variable names again
00:35  NET_: RTPMatt: it would be great, but
00:36  NET_: RTPMatt: back in a few mins.. have to take dog out for 10 minute walk :)

00:46  vacho: how to I parse trough all inputfields within a div???
00:51  ProLoser|Work: is there a fix for animate class that animates all children too?
00:52  RTPMatt: vacho: $('div [type="input"]')
00:52  vacho: RTPMatt: thats to target it.how to I parse through it
00:54  pifantastic: vacho: $('div [type="input"]').each(function() {})
00:54  pifantastic: what do you mean parse?
00:55  RTPMatt: vacho: well, saying "how do I parse them" is not really an answerable question, you can do a .val() on them and get their value,
00:55  vacho: os this correct: if ( $j(this).is(':checked') == 'true'  )
00:55  vacho: or should it be == true
00:56  SugaSlide: if ($(this).is(":checked")){
00:56  SugaSlide: no need for the true part
00:56  SugaSlide: it would be true
00:56  SugaSlide: without the " in anycase
00:56  vacho: OK
00:56  NET_: RTPMatt: back from dog walk :)
00:57  NET_: RTPMatt: did you have another suggestion on how to do this?
00:57  SugaSlide: == "true" is a variable value of true
00:57  vacho: if( checker != true)
00:57  vacho: what about that part t hen
00:57  SugaSlide: == false :P
00:57  SugaSlide: lol
00:58  Lumpio-: if (!checker)
00:58  Kul: want to make a giant wheel using jquery
00:58  Lumpio-: Personally I don't like ==/!= true/false at all
00:58  Kul: where to start ? :|

01:07  cpg: hello, quick question on the validation plugin. is it possible to make it disable buttons if the validation fails?
01:07  cpg: i am very technical but fairly new to JQ and need some advice/direction
01:08  SugaSlide: should be possible
01:08  cpg: was using prototyppe's observe_field function before
01:08  SugaSlide: in the validate function
01:08  SugaSlide: cant remember off hand what its structure is
01:08  SugaSlide: there s aplace where you display the errors etc
01:09  SugaSlide: just put an if in it.. if errors then disable buttons
01:11 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
01:12  cpg: SugaSlide: thanks for the advice ... looking ....
01:13  vacho: thanks guys I finally got it to work the way I want.
01:17  joha: does anyone see any syntax error in this? http://pastebin.com/6BhpcymH  ? It works fine in google chrome but not in firefox.

01:20 @coldhead: sup joha
01:21 @coldhead: joha: what do you intend $(this) to refer to on line 2?
01:21 @coldhead: $(window) ?
01:22 @coldhead: also wanna drop a 'var' in front of line 5?
01:22  joha: ohh
01:23  vacho: <3 IE6
01:24  joha: coldhead: i don't know much but i tried to edit this to happen when the page is loaded http://buildinternet.com/2009/07/animate-curtains-opening-with-jquery/
01:24  nimzie: hi - pretty new to jquery. Going through a form with a bunch of fieldsets and showing / hiding them as I go through this "wizard"-like form. Question is how do I set focus to the first input field in the fadedIn fieldset in this example - http://pastebin.com/pxAjvh2s
01:25  joha: i think that refers to the rope that no longer exists
01:25  joha: so i should remove that line?
01:25  joha: yeah, whoops
01:25  joha: works now :P
01:25  joha: thanks
01:26 @coldhead: good work, johanness
01:26 @coldhead: oops
01:26 @coldhead: joha*

01:29  SeriousJonny: hello guys
01:29  SeriousJonny: dont sleep its still 2:00 here :)
01:31 @coldhead: its 11.30am here
01:31 @coldhead: what you got serious j
01:31  SeriousJonny: ehh
01:31 * coldhead np: edith frost - calling over time
01:31  SeriousJonny: just work
01:31  RTPMatt: NET: did you try this http://paste2.org/p/1104609 ?
01:31  RTPMatt: seems to work well for me
01:31  SeriousJonny: lets see
01:32  SeriousJonny: if i have a input box when someone change its value, and i have a label with an integer... so [inputbox;standard value 1] so if someone change its value to lets say 10 i whant to change my labels value too, input x label = label new value
01:33  SeriousJonny: whats the best way to listen to this
01:33  SeriousJonny: input.change()
01:33  soee: hi, is it possible to get text shadow using jquery over all browsers ?
01:33  snover: you did a good job of answering your own question, SeriousJonny
01:33  SeriousJonny: :D
01:34  SeriousJonny: iam still thinking
01:34  SeriousJonny: cause
01:34  SeriousJonny: user types
01:34  snover: soee: jQuery is not a replacement for CSS.
01:34  SeriousJonny: lets say 1000
01:34  RTPMatt: SeriousJonny: .change will only show up when the user clicks off of the input, if you want it to show up right away, you should probably use .keypress
01:34  SeriousJonny: so i would have to multiply the way when the user types 1 10 1000
01:34  SeriousJonny: i see
01:35  SeriousJonny: no in that case the user wouldnt lose focus on inputbox :/
01:35  SeriousJonny: thought change works on the fly
01:35  SeriousJonny: hrm
01:36  SeriousJonny: well i guess
01:36  SeriousJonny: i put in keypress a little timer
01:36  RTPMatt: andekasp (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
01:36  RTPMatt: For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
01:36 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
01:36  RTPMatt: [http://api.jquery.com/change/]
01:37  SeriousJonny: so he can type lets say 1240 and if he stops 1-2 seconds from a value to another i can do my math
01:38  RTPMatt: SeriousJonny: that more complicated, you could do something like set a timer, and if the timer for 1-2 sec, and if the timer ends process then input, and have the keypress event reset the timer so every time they press a key the time restarts
01:40  nimzie: can anyone help me with this? Focus setting issue (commented code w/question) - thanks ! http://pastebin.com/pxAjvh2s
01:41  karega: does anyone know of a util that will decode html entities?
01:41  SeriousJonny: that was in my mind
01:41  SeriousJonny: i fiddle around atm
01:42  SeriousJonny: RTPMatt when i have something working i post it :)
01:42  RTPMatt: cool

01:49  Kul: how to rotate div continually ?
01:50  Kul: like a giant wheel ?
01:54 @coldhead: Kul: i would try using animate() and whatever the magic CSS is that lets rotate things
01:54 @coldhead: with a callback to keep rotating it
01:55 @coldhead: i wonder what davidwalsh is doing right now
01:55 @coldhead: with his funny little beard
01:55 @coldhead: Kul http://davidwalsh.name/css-transform-rotate
01:55  Kul: coldhead : thanks!
01:56  Kul: coldhead : I'm looking something like this --> http://maninblack.info/_proj/jquery-ui-wheel/demos/wheel/
01:57  Kul: Actually I have 1 giantwheel in my website and I want to rotate it!
01:57  Kul: cars of giant wheel must remain straight and it must not rotate!

02:01  MagusOTB: Is there a way to theme the margin and padding sizes on buttons and dialogs and such in jquery-UI?
02:01  Kul: coldhead: check this out --> http://jsfiddle.net/sjscc/
02:02  Kul: something like that but that script is not helping me as I cant adjust the radius in it!
02:02  snover: MagusOTB: no, it is totally and completely impossible. impossible.
02:02  snover: there is no such thing as css.
02:02  SeriousJonny: humm
02:03  SeriousJonny: this seams simple but still i cant get it to work xD
02:03  MagusOTB: snover: I'm aware that I can mess with the CSS rules themselves, but there's not a way to do it with the theme roller or whatever?
02:03  Kul: @coldhead you can also check the link --> www.glintt.in/vitamins/
02:03  snover: no, themeroller pretty much only does the colours and border radius
02:03  snover: what you see is what you get
02:03  snover: and uh
02:03  Kul: scroll towards right U'll find Giant wheel !
02:03  snover: there is no control to do what you want so I guess you don’t get to see it
02:04  SeriousJonny: http://jsfiddle.net/nXeaa/ maybe someone smarter can deal with this xD
02:04  snover: ?tijnh
02:04  bot-t: This is #jquery, not #handholding.
02:06  MagusOTB: snover: Jesus, excuse me for not knowing the exact limits of theme-roller.
02:07 @ajpiano: MagusOTB, word to the wise...
02:07 @ajpiano: maintain any overriding that you do in a separate stylesheet
02:07 @ajpiano: so that you can upgrade your jquery ui theme if changes are made over time to add new widgets, or you want to tweak the images or something
02:08  snover: MagusOTB: I’m not being intentionally inflammatory, I am just slouching and it is crushing my heart
02:08  MagusOTB: ajpiano: Thanks. that's a good idea
02:08 @ajpiano: if you do the overrides separately, you won't have to redo all your changes separately
02:08 @ajpiano: MagusOTB: yeah, i learnt that one the hardway
02:08  MagusOTB: snover: -_-
02:14  soee: can i inside jquery code add IE6 condition ?
02:17  SeriousJonny: if ie6 then
02:17  SeriousJonny: just find the function to find out browser type
02:17  SeriousJonny: version*
02:18  NET_: RTPMatt: just watned to say, your siteId attribute idea works pretty handily.. i guess it's good oto go simple.
02:18  SeriousJonny: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
02:20  NET_: anyway, next problem ie throws,, i have .jsonp{success:function(data){ globalvar = data; var dl = { key: data.index.values[data.index.defaultkey], dt = data.defaultkey}   this throws an error on the var dl= {  as i have a new line there.
02:20  NET_: It says expected identifier string or number.
02:21  MagusOTB: you sure it's not cause you're using dt = .. instead of dt: ...
02:21  NET_: MagusOTB: that was a typo in my exampel sorry, so that's not the answer.
02:24  MagusOTB: oh. I'm not sure then.

02:27  linelevel: Hi. Is it possible to write a function which takes a jQuery object (representing some DOM element) as argument and returns true if the element is a jQuery UI dialog box (i.e., has had .dialog() called on it)?
02:28  mkorcy: I'm trying to use jquery-mobile, i'm loading a data-role=content div in the html then trying to add a list via getJSON but the list doesn't style with the mobile attributes should i be doing something to trigger the styling? if i hard code the list in the html it works fine
02:34  Snerf: I have some div elements, and an image. Is there a way I can not run onblur. or lose focus of the div element when the image is clicked?
02:36  paul_irish: what's etiger's nick?
02:36  paul_irish: eTiger82 ? 84?

02:39  paul_irish: chovy: what sorta new shit
02:39  paul_irish: thx xeen
02:40  chovy: .template
02:40  chovy: supposedly i can load a template with a script tag cross-domain.
02:40  paul_irish: assuming its jsonp'd..
02:41  chovy: it is "supposed" to work off an id on <script>
02:41  chovy: doesn't appear to work, and very little examples out there about this particular challenge.
02:41  chovy: .getJSONP is my next course of action.
02:41  chovy: but then it isn't really a template(htm) file.

02:43  paul_irish: hey!
02:43  Snerf: is there a way to not allow a div element to not lose focus?
02:43  paul_irish: divs cant really have focus.
02:43  paul_irish: soooooo
02:44 @coldhead: replace the div with a giant text input and give that a blur handler that refocuses it
02:44 @coldhead: that wouldn't be annoying at all
02:44  chovy: paul_irish: any suggestions?
02:45  paul_irish: nope.
02:46  ProLoser|Work: is there a fix for animate class that animates all children too?
02:47  snover: how would that be a fix?
02:47  ProLoser|Work: because if you animate to a class on an element, it's childrent are not animated
02:47  ProLoser|Work: they jump to the final state at the end of the animation period
02:48  paul_irish: oh for the animated switchClass() in UI
02:48  ProLoser|Work: i've been doing el.find('*') and applying the class to the children just to get them to animate but i don't like this solution
02:48  snover: nope, write one and submit a patch
02:48  ProLoser|Work: switch/add/remove, ya
02:48  paul_irish: thats up to you. :)
02:48  Snerf: coldhead, thanks, will give that a try
02:48  paul_irish: lol
02:48  ProLoser|Work: would my approach be a poor solution, or is there a decent way i could cache the el.find('*')?
02:49  ProLoser|Work: there's a subtle stutter i'd like to reduce
02:49  ProLoser|Work: when i ask about caching the find, i mean that the find is called upon animation event to whatever li of a ul that's to be animated
02:50  chovy: what else can i expect from MS.
02:50  ProLoser|Work: i know how to cache a selected dom, but i don't know how to properly cache a set of selected doms (such as the children of li's)

03:12  Trisox: no but then again its 03:12
03:12 @coldhead: SeriousJonny: fine, just use html5 and disallow old browsers
03:14  Trisox: lator!!
03:14  Trisox: thnx for the help coldhead
03:14 @coldhead: <input pattern="[0-9]+" />
03:14 @coldhead: no probs
03:14  Trisox: aight!
03:14  SeriousJonny: hrm i dun understand
03:15  SeriousJonny: what has watermark todo with the restriction problem ^^
03:15  SeriousJonny: ew
03:15  SeriousJonny: html5 can do this
03:15 @coldhead: i'm sorry, don't let me confuse you
03:15  SeriousJonny: nice
03:15  SeriousJonny: well
03:15 @coldhead: its my first day using jquery
03:15  SeriousJonny: you liarrr
03:15 @coldhead: from what i've learned so far you can either rely on html5, use a plugin or painstakingly reivent the wheel
03:15  Arimil: Hm, when doing an ajax request with multiple variables would it be data: "status="+ status, "id="+ id, or data: "status="+ status "id="+ id, ?
03:16  SeriousJonny: well
03:16  SeriousJonny: on this 1 solution i got
03:16  SeriousJonny: is tricky
03:16 @coldhead: Arimil: you should avoid serialising by hand
03:16 @coldhead: use serialise or let jQuery do it itself
03:16  Arimil: uh?
03:16 @coldhead: serialize*
03:16  SeriousJonny: on keyup i can just replace each value of the inputbox but leave just numbers
03:17  SeriousJonny: this.value = this.value.replace(/[^0-9\.]/g,''); but somehow this dun works
03:17  SeriousJonny: iam not familar on regex
03:17  Arimil: coldhead: thanks, but I already have about 12 pages of code and I really don't feel like going back and changing all of it
03:17  SeriousJonny: what stands /g for?
03:17 @coldhead: SeriousJonny: global

03:22  Arimil: so anyone? I cant seem to find it anywhere :\
03:23  Arimil: "status="+ status, "id="+ id, or data: "status="+ status "id="+ id, ?
03:23 @coldhead: SeriousJonny: if you use HTML5 Boilerplate you don't even have to think about it, it all just works
03:24 @coldhead: Arimil: .ajax({etc etc data: {status: status, id: id}, etc etc})
03:24  SeriousJonny: hmm
03:24  Arimil: coldhead: thanks
03:25  SeriousJonny: isnt this from paulirish?

03:31  SeriousJonny: iam not gonna go trough 10k files
03:31 @coldhead: yes but every day it will use slightly fewer hacks
03:31  SeriousJonny: to implement ^^

03:42 @coldhead: why so hatey, SeriousJonny
03:43  Arimil: pifantastic: you sure? the remove function was working I thought the problem was I forgot one of the values in the change function name
03:43  aaroncicali: Arimil: you're missing a comma after type: "POST"
03:43  aaroncicali: in the change function
03:43 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 85 seconds
03:43  pifantastic: oh, yeah that could be it too
03:44  aaroncicali: you should also add semicolons after your functions when you define them as a variable assignment
03:45  aaroncicali: Arimil: you're also missing a few hashes in change() ... $("tabs")
03:46  aaroncicali: lastly, you really should cache your selectors
03:47  Arimil: aaroncicali: missing hashes?
03:47  Arimil: oh found it
03:47  SeriousJonny: cause i have to work trough xtc and it use smarty as a template system :/
03:47  SeriousJonny: 10 pages in shop = 100+ smarty templates
03:48  Arimil: nope still same problem :(

03:49  aaroncicali: Arimil: I'm not getting any errors after those fixes
03:49  aaroncicali: paste what you've got
03:49  Arimil: k
03:49  Arimil: http://pastebin.com/txdLtWw0
03:51  Arimil: oh, I fixed the second missing hash
03:51  Arimil: it's not fixed in that paste
03:51  SeriousJonny: god i love jq
03:51  aaroncicali: Arimil: not getting any errors
03:52  aaroncicali: do I need to tke some action to reproduce the error?
03:52  SeriousJonny: the only niche it doesnt cover well is app layout
03:52  Arimil: aaroncicali: the error triggers when you change the dropdown
03:52  aaroncicali: ahh... I don't have the rendered PHP
03:52  aaroncicali: gimme a second
03:53  Arimil: aaroncicali: I pasted it with the php rendered
03:54  Arimil: aaroncicali: fixed
03:54  Arimil: aaroncicali: thanks for your help
03:54  aaroncicali: yeah, I just hadn't grabbed it.  You've got onchange='change(this.value,)" in your <select> elements
03:55  aaroncicali: no problem
03:55  Arimil: yeah :p
03:55  Arimil: just found that
03:55  aaroncicali: there are better ways to do what you're doing though
03:55  aaroncicali: interested?

03:55  Arimil: nope I thought that fixed it
03:55  Arimil: but it didn't
03:56  Arimil: *sigh*
03:56  Arimil: I wish it gave me a line number T_T
03:56  SeriousJonny: hmm why dont you bind a listener on your dropdowns?
03:56  aaroncicali: it should give a line number, what're you using?
03:57  Arimil: aaroncicali: chrome
03:57  aaroncicali: SeriousJonny: he is, but they're inline (eww)
03:57  aaroncicali: I like Firefox with web developer toolbar and firebug while developing
03:58  aaroncicali: if you don't have adequate error reporting, you should try something different
03:58  Arimil: oh crap
03:59  SeriousJonny: yeah i mean that ^^
03:59  SeriousJonny: for each option this is just bogus data
03:59  Arimil: wow epic fail on my part
04:00  Arimil: "SELECT `division` FROM `rollcall_divisions` WHERE `status` = 2 ORDER BY `division` ASC
04:00  Arimil: $array['id'] will not be in that query

04:17  cpg: still does not trigger
04:17  aaroncicali: cpg: which validation plugin are you using?
04:17 * cpg is thinking his ubmit is probably with something nor supported by the plugin .... ?
04:17  cpg: aaroncicali: using jquery.validate
04:18  alcuadrado: I can't understand the first lines of core.js... why jQuery is defined in two different scopes :s

04:26  Arimil: the value already has a value

04:29  talented: Arimil, why not define your vars in document ready?
04:29  Arimil: talented: they cause js errors
04:30  aaroncicali: here ya go: http://jsfiddle.net/w6NyN/2/
04:30  Arimil: it will yell when the page loads saying they aren't defined
04:30  talented: what errors did they cause?
04:30  talented: are you using them in the document right away?
04:31  Arimil: talented: nope
04:31  RTPMatt: talented: he is using them in onclick='remove(19)' and what not
04:31  aaroncicali: talented: it's because they're being assigned functions in the jquery wrap, then being used inline
04:31  aaroncicali: exactly
04:31  Zxurian: is there a way to duplicate the $(document).ready() function within the response from an ajax request that will wait until the ajax request itself has finished loading?
04:31  aaroncicali: BUT... moving your event listeners out of the DOM will solve that problem
04:32  talented: why not let jquery control the click on those elements?
04:32  aaroncicali: Zxurian: ajax requests only call the callback when the request has finished
04:32  Zxurian: right, but in the ajax response itself
04:32  aaroncicali: whattya mean?
04:32  Zxurian: let's say you hae an ajax request on a page
04:32  Zxurian: it's fired off, and a response is returned
04:32  aaroncicali: are you injecting a large amount of content into the DOM?
04:33  Arimil: what's so bad about onclick anyway? lol
04:33  Zxurian: within that response, is there a way to tell when the response has finished loading?
04:33  aaroncicali: Arimil:  you should strive to separate your content from code
04:33  aaroncicali: it makes your code more portable
04:33  RTPMatt: Arimil: it mixes the markup with the code
04:34  Arimil: hm, you would hate to see some of my php then
04:34  RTPMatt: lol
04:34  aaroncicali: Zxurian, the callback is only fired when the response is ready.  Do you mean to say that you are injecting the response into the DOM, and you want a callback then the content is finished being rendered?
04:35  aaroncicali: Arimil:  everyone starts somewhere.  you don't have to take the advice of anyone in here, but most recommendations are sound and will help you write better code
04:35  aaroncicali: you'll come around eventually
04:35  aaroncicali: :)
04:35  Zxurian: a new javascript function is contained within the response being injected into the DOM. I want to be able to cal that function when the response is finished being injected, but becuase the particular piece of code I'm working on will be distributed, and I won't be able to control the parent code, I want the check to be performed from within the response itself
04:36  SeriousJonny: ow noes
04:36  SeriousJonny: out of zigarets :(
04:36  Arimil: aaroncicali: I'm not going to change it now, however I'll remember it for next time
04:36  SeriousJonny: still 04:35 :(
04:37  Zxurian: i don't know if it's even possible, but it's a curious problem that I ran into in design
04:39  SeriousJonny: doesnt firebug show live changes to attr rel ?
04:42  ty2u: hey jquery! using jquery (for a menu) how can one make all <a> tags within a certain container (the <ul> tag) match the width minus the padding of their parent elements (which are <li> tags)?
04:43  aaroncicali: Zxurian: have you tried appending a script tag to the document's <head>?
04:44  aaroncicali: ty2u: you should be able to use CSS for that, no?
04:45  ty2u: aaroncicali, i tried, it doesn't subtract the padding from the width when I make the width 100%
04:45  SeriousJonny: well try offset
04:45  SeriousJonny: iam not shure
04:45  aaroncicali: just make the <a> tags display: block, they'll automatically be the max width
04:45  ty2u: thanks, ill try it out
04:46  aaroncicali: no problem
04:46  aaroncicali: you really don't want to do a bunch of traversing and applying inline styles with JS just to solve a CSS issue
04:46  SeriousJonny: ^^
04:47  aaroncicali: SeriousJonny: it could be that "rel" is not valid for your doctype, so firebug doesn't show it
04:50  ty2u: ok so they already had display block on them, so i randomly tried taking float:left off them and they went the full width, thanks again!\
04:50  aaroncicali: sweet!
04:50  aaroncicali: you're welcome
04:50  rpj8: does the innerWrap function not exist anymore? I'm not able to find it in the documentation and it's not working in my code: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1296

04:51  bot-t: .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
04:51  rpj8: ahhhh
04:51  rpj8: thank you :)
04:51  aaroncicali: welcome :)
04:52  SeriousJonny: nana it shoes it as a value
04:52  SeriousJonny: but on live changes per script
04:52  SeriousJonny: it doesnt
04:52  SeriousJonny: show the change i mean
04:52  SeriousJonny: still console.log gets you the value
04:52  Zxurian: @AAroncicali, so within the response, include a javascript to attach the $(document).ready() to the head of the DOM it's getting injected to?
04:53  aaroncicali: Zxurian: I'm pretty sure document.ready() ONLY works for the real actual DOMready event, so no... that won't work
04:53  aaroncicali: BUT... why couldn't you just append a <script> tag to the head
04:53  aaroncicali: ?
04:53  aaroncicali: in your response, append a script tag and that code will be run
04:54  Zxurian: well running the code isn't an issue
04:54  aaroncicali: what's the issue?
04:54  aaroncicali: I'm missing the point
04:54  Zxurian: the issue is having some sort of check to see if the response is finished loading "before" running the code
04:54  Zxurian: but that check has to be within the response itself
04:55  aaroncicali: I think there's a misunderstanding... "finished loading"... what does that mean?
04:55  Zxurian: aka, a $(document).ready() check, not from the parent DOM, but returned within the ajax response itself
04:55  aaroncicali: the callback in your ajax function only gets called when the response is ready, and thus it has already "finished loading" from the server
04:55  Zxurian: i'm miscommuniating somehow... gonna rephease
04:55  aaroncicali: what ajax() function are you using?  get(), post(), load(), ajax() ?
04:55  Zxurian: [rephrase]
04:57  aaroncicali: I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that you're injecting a large block of content into the DOM and your browser takes a bit of time to render it
04:57  aaroncicali: but only because I faced a similar problem recently
04:57  Zxurian: could be large, the content is dynamic
04:58  aaroncicali: right, but the code in your callback runs immediately and you want it to wait until the content has finished rendering
04:58  aaroncicali: right?
04:58  Zxurian: not using the callback at all
04:58  Zxurian: give me a min, rephrasing
04:58  aaroncicali: k
05:00  Zxurian: user has his own document. I give him a link to put into his document, wherever he wants my block of content to appear: "<script src="http://foo.com/bar.js"></script>". Within that script is a document.write that ouputs the content. within that document.write, I have additional jquery functions that I want to run, but not until the content is finished being output from the document.write.
05:01  aaroncicali: right.  document.write() is synchronous, which means the code that comes after it won't run until it's finished
05:01  Zxurian: so then I'm right that the entire content return "should" be completely there before the jquery functions that follow it fire off
05:02  aaroncicali: even if it seems to take a bit to show the content from the document.write (because of rendering time), the content is IMMEDIATELY available to any jquery DOM related functions right after the call to document.write
05:03  aaroncicali: document.write("<div id='apples'>I like apples</div>"); $('#apples').hide();
05:03  aaroncicali: that should work just fine
05:04  Zxurian: let me take that example
05:05  aaroncicali: here it is in action: http://jsfiddle.net/zKL5n/
05:05  Zxurian: document.write("<div id='apples'>I like apples</div><script type=\"text/JavaScript\">$('#apples').hide();</script>");
05:07  Zxurian: jsfiddle chokes when I try to run that
05:13  rpj8: i have  a question but it'll take me a minute to phrase it correctrly ;)
05:13  aaroncicali: Zxurian: it's a problem of escaping
05:13  aaroncicali: document.write('<div id="apples">I like apples</div>\x3Cscript type="text/javascript">$("#apples").css("background", "red");\x3C/script>');
05:13 @coldhead: we'll just wait here then
05:13  aaroncicali: that works
05:13  rpj8: thank you coldhead !!! :3
05:15  aaroncicali: Zxurian... did you get that?
05:16  rpj8: http://pastebin.com/9dYjcKgZ <---- which div is the add class applied to in that example?
05:16  rpj8: it works the way I'd like it to
05:16  aaroncicali: all divs
05:16  aaroncicali: the class is applied to all matching elements, which in that case would be ALL div tags on the page
05:16  rpj8: aw poop.
05:17  aaroncicali: if you need it more specific, only select the element you're targeting
05:17  aaroncicali: use an id
05:17  aaroncicali: $('#myID').addClass('awwPoop');
05:17  rpj8: heh.
05:17  rpj8: could I do something like div:current to select the current tag the a.addclass sits in?
05:18  aaroncicali: what's the actual goal?
05:18  Zxurian: bah, sorry, got pulled away, reading history
05:18  aaroncicali: because I'm sure you could do this easier
05:19  aaroncicali: Zxurian: that works
05:19  rpj8: those two links are to add/remove a class from a given div. once removed i want to be able to add it again to the same div I'd removed it from.
05:20  aaroncicali: there's no real way to know which element you removed the class from unless you know how to select it again
05:20  rpj8: so turn line 15 from <div class="leftcolumn_inner"> to <div class=""> back to <div class="leftcolumn_inner"> again
05:20  aaroncicali: or unless you store it
05:20  rpj8: i see
05:20  rpj8: i can just give it an id
05:20  rpj8: i was just curious if there was some slick filter or something
05:20  Zxurian: so the \x3, is that a requirement for jsfiddle, or shoudl I be using tha tin my own document.write when i'm passing the script tag with the jquery insdie it?
05:21  aaroncicali: unless you know how the markup will be formatted
05:21  aaroncicali: rpj8: you can always find the closest <div> to the clicked link, will this always be how your markup will be formed for this example?
05:21  rpj8: yes
05:21  aaroncicali: Zxurian: use it in your own JS.  AFAIK it's the only way to call the code in the script tag
05:22  aaroncicali: rpj8: then it's easy...
05:22  rpj8: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
05:22  rpj8: using this ^?
05:23  rpj8: that derek bro's going to be in trouble :P
05:25  aaroncicali: http://jsfiddle.net/jT6Jq/
05:25  aaroncicali: yes, closest()

08:50  Cork: sorry you where right
08:50  trollboy: thanks!
08:50  Cork: GreenRanger: if the server sends the json as '30' it will be a string
08:51  Cork: GreenRanger: json makes a difference between key:30 and key:'30'
08:52  GreenRanger: Cork: hmm, In my server script I'm echoing it with printf('%d', bla);, so it should be an int and not a string.
08:52  Cork: GreenRanger: not that it really matters as js has dynamic typing

08:53  MadMaX_: can you listen for a left mouse click and make something happen if its over a certain element?
08:53  talented: GreenRanger, how is your server displaying it?
08:53  GreenRanger: Cork: well when I echo it out on the client side it echos string(2) '30' and if I pass it to parseInt() it returns NaN.  How else should I do it?
08:54  talented: in text/html?
08:54  d7a7z7e7d: MadMaX_: in that case why wouldn't you just bind an onclick event to the element?
08:54  MadMaX_: oh, I mean right, sorry
08:55  MadMaX_: is there a rightclick event?
08:55  d7a7z7e7d: oh, right click? no idea, sorry
08:55  MadMaX_: all good
08:55  MadMaX_: me neither
08:55  Cork: GreenRanger: "echo it client side"?
08:55  Cork: GreenRanger: have you checked whats in the json the server sends?
08:56  Cork: GreenRanger: i have a feeling it sends key:"string(2) '30'"

08:56  destinydriven: like this? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/612374234
08:57  GreenRanger: Cork: echo the script directly from the server script, or the response from the ajax request?
08:57  Cork: GreenRanger: ex. inspecting the responce in firebugs net panel
08:58  trollboy: Cork and Jarda how would I target the div that contains them?
08:58  Cork: trollboy: normal css selector
08:58  GreenRanger: Cork: Where do I find that?  Net -> XHR ?
08:59  Cork: trollboy: with a class or index or id or what ever fitts your need
08:59  Cork: GreenRanger: open the net panel, do the request, and expand the request line in the net panel, then click the responce line
08:59  Jarda: $('div:has(span:contains(123))')
08:59  GreenRanger: ya it shows response string(2) "35"
09:00  Cork: Jarda: YUCK! that line is a bit to freeking slow...
09:00  Cork: GreenRanger: so its an error in the server side

09:21  ruby_on_tails: hi coldhead
09:22  mrmil: Hi, a quick question: what would be the best way to simulate a "when user does nothing" event?
09:23  sean`: bot-t, tell doonie, hot link :p
09:23  bot-t: sean`, Okay.
09:24  mrmil: The only think I can think of is checking when user does something and keep reseting a countdown, but that seems ... not right
09:24  binni: Is it possible for a user to start typing into an input text field and use jquery to notice when he has stopped typing for example 4 seconds?
09:24  ruby_on_tails: mrmil: set a flag as true, for next 5 secs if any mouse/keyboard activity set it false ? do something after 5 secs if flag is true ?
09:25  mrmil: they want 10 minutes :), if user doesn't do anything in 10 minutes, show a popup (argh)
09:25  ruby_on_tails: binni: what if the user resumes typing after a 3 seconds pause ?
09:25  ruby_on_tails: mrmil: just replace the time thing i said ?
09:25  mrmil: ruby_on_tails: I know, i get your point :)
09:26  binni: ruby_on_tails: then jquery shouldn't notice anything

09:26  mrmil: ok, thanks, I kinda hoped, there is some kind of currently-doing-nothing event :D, thanks anyway
09:26  sean`: how cool am I, no city :D
09:26  d7a7z7e7d: hah, colder here :D
09:26  ruby_on_tails: mrmil: in that case another better solution is start a timer on document.load, reset it to 0 if any keyboard/mouse thing happens, if timer > 600 alert("argh")
09:26  mrmil: ?weather
09:26  bot-t: mrmil, Google Time/Weather Information - ? weather <City/State Name|Code>
09:26  mrmil: hm
09:26  sean`: d7a7z7e7d, I'm not sure that's worth laughing about :p
09:26  ruby_on_tails: binni: can you put a submit button ?
09:27  d7a7z7e7d: i was thinking that myself, hoping you wouldnt catch on :\
09:27  sean`: :p
09:27  mrmil: ruby_on_tails: yeah that was the first solution I thought of, keep resetting a countdown.
09:27  ruby_on_tails: mrmil: that sounds better to me
09:28  binni: ruby_on_tails:  guess I could, but I'd rather not, I'm thinking about just making visual changes to the input field on focus and defocus.
09:28  ruby_on_tails: binni: what you can do is set a timestamp when the value of the input if 1 character long (use .onchange()) and save another timestamp when he stops typing(.onblur, submit()) ? subtract them and alert ?
09:28  ruby_on_tails: .change()*
09:32  binni: Any idea why $("input").focus(function () { alert(this); }); goes on making alert forever when I click on the text input? In this focus example it doesn't do that: http://api.jquery.com/focus/
09:33  sean`: binni, yeah
09:34  sean`: You shouldn't use alert
09:34  sean`: you should use console.log
09:34  sean`: alert removes focus from the element and places it back
09:34  sean`: when you click ok

10:34  dominikl: did anyone ever experience a strange problem with jquery mobile dialogs, that they appear but once the transition is finished, they immediately disappear again?
10:35  k1ng: what is the cheapest andriod phone?
10:35  sean`: yo SeriousJonny !
10:35  sean`: k1ng, the legend
10:35  sean`: if you're still itnerested in quality
10:36  sean`: harry potter and the dissapearing dialogs
10:36  binni: http://jsfiddle.net/yMfyD/ - "starts" is the text inputs starting value, the two alerts give me the same value, I want the first alert to give me the same value as "starts" but with the added keypress, how can I accomplish this?
10:37  binni: that is the .keypress() event is executed before the new character is added
10:37  walle_: hi, i'm trying to use jquery ui tabs with a mix of iframe and div as tab content. is it possible to make the iframe fill the tab display area?
10:38  sean`: binni, fuck off with that alert debugging
10:38  sean`: use console
10:38  k1ng: lmao
10:38  k1ng: the legend isnt a movie?
10:39  binni: sean`: just a general advise or does it affect the outcome here? :)
10:40  SeriousJonny: humm
10:40  SeriousJonny: long of unformated text
10:40  SeriousJonny: no \n or <br> in text
10:41  SeriousJonny: deal with javascript?
10:41  SeriousJonny: count. and make random <br>
10:41  SeriousJonny: good way?
10:41  SeriousJonny: best way would be count ". "
10:41  maestrojed: I have a div of limited height. I use jQuery to fill that div with more data then will fit. The scroll bar exposes. Great. But, your position ends up at the bottom of the dig; The scroll bar all the way down. How do I let the position stay at the top?
10:41  SeriousJonny: after 2-3 a br

10:46  owzzz: Hi guys, can anyone tell me why my fancybox is not firing? http://wwt.ucreative.ac.uk/ I have a click event attached http://pastebin.com/g7WaPX5m, If i paste that into firebug and then click the mediawall images it loads into the fancybox... If I just try and click it without it does not fire..
10:47  MadMaX_: unfo-, browsers display differently when it comes to odd numbers
10:49  MadMaX_: i f n hate ie
10:49  SeriousJonny: make the background imgaes randomly change
10:51  mgutz: Does jquery-data support collections, specifically binding to add/remove events?
10:51  unfo-: MadMaX_, ahhh
10:51  MadMaX_: I need a database to store a lot of values, whats the best way to go? sql, php, small .js files? I need to create the database offline and then upload it
10:52  MadMaX_: I know nothing about databases, so just a point in the right direction and I'll go learn whats needed
10:52  SeriousJonny: sql
10:52  mgutz: a seed script usually works best
10:53  MadMaX_: I'll look into both of those
10:53  SeriousJonny: sql + json
10:53  mgutz: most databases should have utilities that do that for you
10:53  MadMaX_: json? neverheard of it
10:54  SeriousJonny: ?json
10:54  bot-t: SeriousJonny, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
10:54  MadMaX_: but then again, haven't heard of seed script
10:54  SeriousJonny: best way to use db is sql, no files imo
10:54  SeriousJonny: phpmyadmin
10:54  SeriousJonny: you can load xls, csv
10:54  MadMaX_: SeriousJonny, could I retreive a small amount of data from a few million values without taking up to much time?
10:55  SeriousJonny: any type of offline data into it
10:55  mgutz: seed script is just sql
10:55  MadMaX_: doing it this way i mean
10:55  SeriousJonny: how are the values
10:55  SeriousJonny: right now
10:55  SeriousJonny: in wich kind of data?
10:55  SeriousJonny: if you have a structure
10:56  SeriousJonny: you can write a php parser for your values
10:56  SeriousJonny: and add them easy into a db
10:56  SeriousJonny: if its a common structure
10:56  MadMaX_: well... they need to be paired, like... idk how to do this yet but for exxample, movie name paried with actors in it and all specific links to other sites as well as the img url
10:56  SeriousJonny: there shure classes or phpmyadmin can deal with it
10:56  SeriousJonny: yes but
10:56  SeriousJonny: there has to be a stRUCTURE OR NOT?
10:56  SeriousJonny: Moviename, Url, Title
10:56  SeriousJonny: something like this
10:56  MadMaX_: structure?
10:57  MadMaX_: yes
10:57  SeriousJonny: just past 1 line of your current
10:57  MadMaX_: no current, starting from scartch because old way was extremly wasteful
10:57  SeriousJonny: if there is pattern/structure wich seperates values
10:57  SeriousJonny: then its a thing of few seconds
10:58  SeriousJonny: you just have to seperate values in a way a db can easy import them
10:58  SeriousJonny: just use excel
10:58  SeriousJonny: or openoffice
10:58  SeriousJonny: accsess
10:58  MadMaX_: I can use excel??? sweet
10:58  SeriousJonny: any database like application
10:58  SeriousJonny: and you can import this in a second with 0 knowleadge into a db
10:59  SeriousJonny: shure
10:59  SeriousJonny: excel is ok
10:59  SeriousJonny: export as csv
10:59  mgutz: with join tables from excel?
10:59  mgutz: seems like you're better off doing everyting in mysql or sqlite locally, then use a utility to export DDL and seed data
11:00  SeriousJonny: yes but
11:00  SeriousJonny: its a pain in the ass
11:00  SeriousJonny: he has no php knowleadge
11:00  SeriousJonny: nor sql
11:00  mgutz: my bad, late to the conversation
11:00  SeriousJonny: so easy is just excel
11:00  SeriousJonny: its valid
11:00  SeriousJonny: its the same as any thing else
11:01  SeriousJonny: as long as you keep a structure in your files
11:01  SeriousJonny: you can even use notepad
11:01  SeriousJonny: who cares ^^
11:02  Noeble: question: if I generate html with jquery my django template tags wont load. Anyone know how I can work around that?
11:04  MadMaX_: so, for example, lets say I wanted to make it easier on myself since I can't code worth a crap, I can write ahk pretty well so what I'd like to do is ... for example, imagine a input box, above it is several icons, actor, category, movie name, writer, directer, click on one and type in a, now under the column a and we'll say, category, I'll have in alphabetical order the movies having to do with the closest category match (action in 
11:04  MadMaX_: associated with them
11:05  MadMaX_: sorry, thinking out loud, my bad guys
11:07  SeriousJonny: well if you could code a bit php in php
11:07  SeriousJonny: php*
11:07  SeriousJonny: well it would be easy php + jq > store that in a sql db
11:07  SeriousJonny: 1 table for categories
11:07  SeriousJonny: 1 table for movie, description
11:07  SeriousJonny: 1 table for actors
11:08  SeriousJonny: fill in first categories
11:08  SeriousJonny: then actors
11:08  SeriousJonny: this would save you lots of type time
11:08  SeriousJonny: cause then you could make a easy php interface with auto type text
11:08  SeriousJonny: where you type "Ste" and it suggest you right actor names for this word
11:08  SeriousJonny: but if you cant do that all
11:09  SeriousJonny: just use excel and make a db
11:09  SeriousJonny: if you can do bit access
11:09  SeriousJonny: its even easyer there
11:09  SeriousJonny: cause what i told you, you can also do in access
11:09  level09: whats a good IDE for Jquery dev
11:09  level09: is eclipse fine ?
11:10  SeriousJonny: any ide wich can load jquery syntax
11:10  SeriousJonny: lots of commerce free does this
11:10  level09: what is the most popular one  ?
11:10  SeriousJonny: just use what you normaly use if its has jq plugins
11:10  level09: okay thanks
11:11  mgutz: @level09 i would say any editor with Firebug or Chrome development tools > IDE
11:11  MadMaX_: SeriousJonny, I copied all your advice and will try my best to follow it, thanks man
11:11  level09: mgutz: I agree, tho , it would be nice to compile/debug at deveopment time
11:11  level09: without having to launch the browser everytime
11:11  SeriousJonny: well tbh madmax there are lots of movie database scripts as php avilable
11:11  SeriousJonny: a advice
11:11  SeriousJonny: get a free one
11:11  level09: also, code coloring etc ..
11:11  SeriousJonny: fork it for your needs
11:12  mgutz: @level 09 you're talking more than jquery then
11:12  mgutz: which language? pHP?
11:12  SeriousJonny: notepad++
11:12  SeriousJonny: is what i use
11:12  SeriousJonny: with no jquery addon
11:12  SeriousJonny: but i dont need one tbh
11:12  MadMaX_: I LOVE notepad++
11:12  level09: mgutz: no , just jquery
11:13  SeriousJonny: yes it can anything i need ^^
11:13  mgutz: you dont need to copmile it,
11:13  level09: doesn't jquery require performance testing , etc ..
11:13  level09: or profiling ?
11:13  level09: code completion
11:13  binni: console.log and just firebug in general so far is great!
11:14  mgutz: not sure, i heard Visual Studio was really good for jQuery code completion if you're on Windows
11:14  mgutz: i use Vim, so i'm crazy
11:15  level09: okay great  thanks :)
11:15  level09: VIM is nice
11:16  level09: still i prefer more GUI tool when possible
11:18 @coldhead: hi ruby_on_tails
11:18 @coldhead: level09: you prefer drag and drop coding?
11:19  ruby_on_tails: hi coldhead
11:19  level09: coldhead: not to that extent :P
11:23  SeriousJonny: aptana isnt bad eather
11:23  SeriousJonny: didnt used it for jq but still
11:23  SeriousJonny: it should provide lots of features and customization to your needs
11:25  ruby_on_tails: baptana
11:25  ruby_on_tails: captana
11:31  zeddeh: So, anyone know if its possible to use ajax to load entire pages into a div, like an iframe
11:31  Noeble: it is
11:31  Noeble: with .load()
11:31  zeddeh: i got it working, its just that when the inner pages redirect to other pages, they actually do it but not inside my div
11:31  Bheam: urgh
11:31  lithi: Hey, whats the setting for $.ajax(); that does stuff while the request is being handled?
11:32  Bheam: so there's no way of creating an event on a checkbox that fires even when i use checkbox.attr('checked', true) ?
11:34  zeddeh: $('#container').load('index.php'); doesn't seem to do anything
11:34  Bheam: i tried checkbox.change(function ...) but it doesn't trigger on attr()
11:35  Cork: zeddeh: nothing shown in the net panel (in what ever tool you use) ?
11:36  MadMaX_: I'm just now learning objects, how do I return the firstname of both arrays in accounting... document.writeln(employees.accounting[what goes here to get both first names?].firstName);
11:36  zeddeh: Cork:  no
11:36  zeddeh: http://pastie.org/1319690
11:37  Cork: zeddeh: put a console.log('here') just before to make sure the code is actually executed
11:37  zeddeh: it is
11:37  zeddeh: i have a console.log there
11:37  zeddeh: console.log("loading");
11:37  Cork: AH
11:38  Cork: zeddeh: you need to wrap your code in jq's domredy function
11:38  zeddeh: ok. :p
11:38  Cork: zeddeh: your modifying an unstable dom tree
11:38  zeddeh: i just figured that the example i copied that from didn't do that
11:39  Cork: zeddeh: its "safe" to do so if you ca GARANTEE that the server won't answer before the dom is ready :)
11:39  Cork: ca==can
11:39  zeddeh: But my problem remains, when i click on a link in the loaded content, it redirects the whole page, how do i force it to load all links into the same container
11:39  Bheam: is it possible to implement my own version of "attr()" for a specific element?
11:39  zeddeh: but the actual loading works now :P
11:40  Cork: zeddeh: you need to catch the elements and overide the default action
11:40 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
11:40  Bheam: like $('#myelement').attr = function(attr, value) {} except it works
11:41 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
11:41  zeddeh: but they dont do that in their examples: http://api.jquery.com/load/
11:41  Cork: Bhavic: sure (function($){ var old = $.fn.attr; $.fn.attr = function() {} })(jQuery);
11:42  Bheam: Cork: that would replace the function globally and not just for my element, no?
11:42  Cork: exactly
11:42  Cork: Bhavic: there is nothing else
11:42  Bheam: Hrrm ok. Is it possible to create an overridable template function then?
11:43  Bheam: much like an event
11:43  Bheam: something that can have a different function for different elements
11:43  Cork: not really
11:43  zeddeh: dont get it, they seem to have it working on the load examples, but they dont have any extra codes
11:44  Cork: Bhavic: each time you call $() a new object is created, so if your function doesn't exist for $.fn, it will only exist for the specific instanse you added it to
11:44  Cork: Bhavic: you can create a new function that takes what element it works with into account
11:45  Cork: Bhavic: (function($){ $.fn.myfuncs = function(action) {} })(jQuery);
11:45  Cork: and then do your stuff in there
11:46  Bheam: i thought there was a way to use prototype
11:46  lithi: Any good debugging functions for jQuery? such as checking for variables?
11:47  lithi: anything like var_dump(); in php?
11:48  SeriousJonny: hmm i guess i give aptana a go
11:48  SeriousJonny: buildin firefox and firebug debugging
11:48  SeriousJonny: sounds good
11:48  maushu: For server-side javascript?
11:49  SeriousJonny: clientside
11:50  Cork: Bheam: $.fn is prototype, and those functions are global for jquery, you need to inside the function deside what it does with different elements
11:50  Cork: Bheam: or do a jquery selection, and add the function to the objects, and use them over and over again
11:51  Cork: Bheam: but that kinda kills the hole idea with jquery
11:51  Bheam: i don't get you
11:52  Bheam: is there a way to define a function just for a jquery selection?
11:52  lithi: http://pastie.org/1319721 , why am I having hard trouble getting the "idStr", it's outputting as Null :(
11:53  Cork: Bheam: ex. $('input') creates a new jquery object every time you run it
11:53  Cork: Bheam: so if the function isn't attached to $.fn it won't be part of the new object
11:54  Cork: Bheam: if you add the function to something like var myobj = $('input'); myobj.myfunc = function() {};
11:54  Cork: Bheam: it will only exist in that one object
11:55  clu3: hi all, suppose im using tablesorter jquery and the table gets replaced by ajax all the time. How can i make the tablesorter always active? like 'live' or something?
11:59  clu3: wow, jquery is really quiet today
11:59  lithi: and ignorant
11:59  sveri: hi, i have a table, which rows can be dragged and dropped (using ui-draggable and ui-droppable), what works so far, but when i add a tablerow jquery and dom-manipulation, without reloading the page, the new row cannot be dragged or dropped, any ideas how to make that work?
12:02  Bheam: Cork: meaning next time i select input, the function won't exist
12:02  Cork: Bheam: exactly
12:03  LazyMukke: i don't know what i'm doing wrong, i'm getting 'invalide label' for '}):\n' in firebug  | line 9 in my pastie http://pastie.org/1319738
12:04  Cork: LazyMukke: you sure you mean }):\n and not });\n in your code?
12:04  lithi: LazyMukke:
12:05  lithi: theres : instead of ;
12:05  LazyMukke: meh
12:05  LazyMukke: lol
12:05  lithi: }):
12:05  LazyMukke: pfff
12:05  LazyMukke: been looking at it for over 15 min
12:05  lithi: Yeah, know the feeling :P
12:05  lithi: i'm still trying to make sense of my problem
12:06  lithi: for some reason my ajax isnt sending a variable properly :|
12:06  lithi: or then again it might be the php page that cant handle it right
12:06  lithi: or then again I'm propably doing the whole thing wrong
12:07  LazyMukke: json ?
12:07  lithi: nop
12:07  lithi: hold on
12:07  LazyMukke: then do use json
12:07  lithi: ?
12:07  LazyMukke: php has build in json decode funtions to put you vars into an array
12:07  LazyMukke: or object
12:08  lithi: http://pastie.org/1319754
12:08  martinchristov: has anyone dealt with @font-face ?
12:09  lithi: idStr comes out correctly, the success function works but $_POST['o']; dumps as NULL
12:11  LazyMukke: hmm
12:12  LazyMukke: i always put my data as an object rather then a string but it should make no difference
12:13  LazyMukke: and $("#content").load('fight.php');
12:13  LazyMukke: can't you just do 'update':'#content'
12:14  Kaapa: guys, is the return of a selector an array?
12:15  Kaapa: I'm guessing not - $.isArray($("tr td:nth-child(2)")) -> false
12:15  sean`: Kaapa, object
12:15  sean`: $.type (..) === 'object'
12:15  Kaapa: can I convert it to array?
12:16  LazyMukke: why would you need it to be an array ?
12:16  sean`: ?get @ KAACH
12:16  bot-t: KAACH, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
12:16  sean`: Kaapa, *
12:16  sean`: .get()
12:16  Kaapa: cause I want to apply the .map utility function
12:16  sean`: $('foo').map (function () {  }); Kaapa
12:16  Kaapa: and not being a true array I'm getting weird cross browser issues
12:16  sean`: There is a chainable version of map
12:16  LazyMukke: yeh
12:17  Noeble: question: is it posible to make elements or text read only? Meaning, that end users cant mark them with the mouse
12:17  lithi: LazyMukke: Yeah I could do that but fight.php isnt included in the #content by default
12:17  lithi: so it would just update an alreayd empty page
12:18  clu3: is there a way to tell jQuery to refresh/update its DOM? after replacing some content with ajax, in the success callback, i want to $("#mytable").tablesorter() but jquery doesn't seem recognize #mytable because it was replaced
12:18  Kaapa: sean`: $.isArray($("tr td:nth-child(2)").map(function(){return this})) <- still false, or did I misunderstand what you said?
12:18  LazyMukke: clu3: then update the table rather then replacing it
12:19  clu3: LazyMukke, the table itself gets changed because the data is realtime, number of rows might change,etc... so i cannot do that
12:19  sean`: Kaapa, .. .get ()
12:19  sean`: $.isArray($("tr td:nth-child(2)").map(function(){return this}).get ())
12:19  sean`: ?factoid map
12:19  bot-t: jesus: $.map(['water'], function(){return 'wine';});
12:20  sean`: bot-t, that's not what I ment, but it's funny

12:21  Kaapa: sean`: got it, thanks
12:22  clu3: uhm... isn't there a simple way like $.reloadDOM() ?
12:22  Kaapa: wasn't aware of the .get() . And the fact that this code worked in ff4 and opera but not on others was killing me
12:24  sean`: Kaapa, shouldn't be a problem
12:25  sean`: clu3, livequery
12:25  sean`: BRO
12:25  sean`: clu3, if you use an uncached selector, it won't have problems with it
12:25  sean`: everytime you throw in a string to jquery, it finds it in the DOM, it doesn't do caching
12:26  sean`: Also, i would advice you to extend the table not to replace it entirely
12:26  sean`: then do .tablesorter ('update') or something like that
12:26  clu3: sean`, how do i specify a selector it as uncached?
12:26  sean`: clu3, by reading
12:27  sean`: <sean`> everytime you throw in a string to jquery, it finds it in the DOM, it doesn't do caching
12:27  sean`: jQuery does not cache, that's it. finito.
12:27  RandomSort: I really do not aprove og internet explorer
12:27  sean`: Only if you do var $foo = $('#bar'); $foo is a cache of the result of $('#bar');
12:28  sean`: And even then you cache yourself, not jquery
12:28  sean`: I don't approve you RandomSort
12:28  clu3: sean`, i might have to go with replacing the content then i guess, more complex ajax for me :)
12:28  sean`: omg

12:39  doonie: heh
12:39  sean`: yeah baby
12:40  doonie: usb drive seems fux0red, switching stuff to dropbox. how secure is dropbox? should one use a truecrypt container in it or does one dare to use it in clear?
12:41  moodh: how can i write an if-statement which checks if an element contains a specific html comment?
12:41  doonie: how is this specific html comment defined
12:45  zeddeh: omg
12:45  zeddeh: anyone know of a iframe autoresize plugin written in jquery that actually works in firefox and chrome? :P
12:47  doonie: stay away from that if you can ;D
12:47  zeddeh: i dont see any alternatives, i need to load one of my forms into my CMS page and i cannot afford to start making changes to the cms itself
12:47  zeddeh: jquery load doesn't really work as described either
12:47  doonie: what about ajax
12:49  zeddeh: isn't that basically the same?
12:49  doonie: its easier to have a div autoresize than an iframe
12:49  zeddeh: yeah but jquery load, doesn't it load stuff by using ajax?
12:49  zeddeh: also when loading stuff into a div, that contains links
12:50  zeddeh: u click the links of the loaded content and it completely ignores that the div and loads the whole page
12:51  doonie: depends how you code it, but yea iframe is 'easier' for some cases
12:54  sean`: zeddeh, iframe has load event
12:54  moodh: doonie: sorry for the late reply, it's like <!-- No Matching Campaign -->
12:54  zeddeh: ok, im guessing thats what the plugins are using
12:55  doonie: moodh not exactly the best thing to search for =)
12:55  moodh: doonie: only thing i have to go on
12:55  moodh: it's to see if there's an ad in the box or not
12:55  moodh: it'll show that comment if no ad is booked on that space
12:55  zeddeh: i really reached a wall here
12:55  sean`: moodh, why not do $('.ad-box').length
12:55  sean`: if it's 0, no add
12:55  sean`: ad
12:56  moodh: because it's a javascript tag inside it
12:56  moodh: which writes the comment or the actual ad
12:56  sean`: so?
12:56  sean`: it writes it to it
12:56  sean`: you can check afterwards
12:56  aro: is there a way to determine if a string is valid json
12:56  sean`: aro, $.parseJSON
12:56  moodh: sean`: i'll give it a try
12:57  doonie: :}
12:57  sean`: moodh, you go girl
12:57  doonie: was new sewnie
12:57  aro: sean` : it throws an error if it is null
12:58  Kaapa: what could make a getJSON not execute a callback when the return is 200?
12:58  sean`: aro, so..
12:58  sean`: not valid json
12:58  sean`: aro, use a try catch
12:58  Kaapa: not valid json...
12:58  Kaapa: I'll try jslink!
12:58  Kaapa: jslint
12:58  Kaapa: k
13:01  moodh: sean`: will comments get counted in .length?
13:03  sean`: comments are unreadable

13:07  sean`: filter:Alpha
13:07  sean`: not opacity
13:07  zeddeh: wtf lol utf-8 is ignored inside the iframe
13:07  PeterB: sean`: so I'd use animate({alpha: '1' instead?
13:07  zeddeh: thats messed up
13:08  sean`: lal no
13:08  sean`: 'opacity'

13:18  zeddeh: also wtf is up with a iframe no displaying the content in UTF-8 but if i open the iframe source separetely the UTF-8 encoding works just fine
13:18  zeddeh: thats beyond me

15:01  JuJuBee: Greetings.  I am a jQuery virgin... :)  Just downloaded it to play with some features.  Looking at the date picker in particular...
15:01  iszak: so unless you've placed it under another element in another page, $('#foo') will be faster.
15:01  sean`: oi
15:01  pk4r: Thanks, I thought $("#elem") initially matches only one element so find() might not work.. made it clear now.
15:02  iszak: well id's should only occur once in the document..
15:02  RTPMatt: if they exist more than once the results are unpredictable
15:07  JuJuBee: I see in the datepicker where I can set minDate and maxDate, but the navigator allows to bypass that.  Any way to prevent?
15:18  Noeble: question: is it posible to make elements or text read only? Meaning, that end users cant mark them with the mouse
15:19  RTPMatt: Noeble: that is a rude thing to do, many people hilight the text while reading it
15:20  freedgy: Noeble: Make it an image :p
15:20  RTPMatt: Noeble: also, there is no way to prevent them from getting it if they really want it
15:21  Noeble: RTPMatt: well its for a application that is a browser.. the is nothing to mark
15:21  Noeble: its just disturbing when working with it.. that clicks sometimes mark stuff int it..
15:22  RTPMatt: Noeble: i think snopes.com does it on their text, you could check it out

16:02  ragefuljoe: is there a way to cache a XML parse so it doesn't do it again when you come back
16:02  ragefuljoe: the xml is large and takes time, so would like it to only do it once, and not reparse unless file ahs changed
16:06  losing: You are "parsing" the XML with jQuery?
16:07  ragefuljoe: yes
16:07  ragefuljoe: right now each time the page is loaded it's parsing a local xml file
16:07  losing: I see
16:07  ragefuljoe: and spitting out <li> for a list
16:07  losing: how large is the file?
16:08  ragefuljoe: the file size is only like 200k
16:08  ragefuljoe: but it has about 640 entries
16:08  losing: that's pretty huge
16:08  ragefuljoe: so thre is noticeable lag
16:08  losing: this is where most people would use a database :)
16:08  ragefuljoe: so parse into db
16:08  ragefuljoe: then do a check and load from db second time?
16:09  losing: It sounds like you are essentially using an XML file as a database right now
16:09 --- sinner is now known as SiNNeR
16:09  ragefuljoe: yeah
16:09  ragefuljoe: the page creation should be the same right, except im reading from db
16:10  ragefuljoe: I am fairly familiar with mySQL, but havent used it with jquery before
16:10  ||cw: javascript isn't well suited for that, but there are some server side things that can quickly parse xml
16:10  ragefuljoe: this is all local, no connection required
16:10  ||cw: you woulnd't use mysql from jquery
16:10  losing: ragefuljoe: You're going to need a server side language, like PHP, Python, Ruby or Perl
16:11  ||cw: ragefuljoe: are you doing it in such a way that the xml file stays loaded the whole time?
16:11  ragefuljoe: it reads it all at once, and creates the html code
16:11  ragefuljoe: then doesn't use the xml after that
16:11  ragefuljoe: unless the user leaves
16:12  ragefuljoe: tho eventual plan is to have it as an iphone app
16:12  losing: this is essentially the exact use case for a database :P
16:12  ||cw: well, why have it in xml then?
16:12  ragefuljoe: maybe there's a way I can just put it into a db to start off
16:12  ragefuljoe: no parsing of xml needed?
16:12  losing: ragefuljoe: exactly
16:12  ragefuljoe: lol cuz i dont know how to use jquery/db
16:12  ||cw: or just html...
16:12  losing: ragefuljoe: jQuery doesnt connect to the DB
16:12  losing: you write some PHP to grab the data from MySQL and output the HTML
16:13  ||cw: losing: he's not using a server
16:13  losing: If this is going to be an iPhone app you would use sqlite
16:13  ragefuljoe: ^_^
16:13  losing: ragefuljoe: you could use localStorage if the browser you are targeting supports it
16:14  ragefuljoe: yes it does

16:51  d3c: that is, at the moment I'm parsing .5M and that seems a bit slow
16:53  iszak: d3c, i guess it depends on the browser/computer.
16:53  iszak: I would hope < 2s
16:54  d3c: iszak: but I mean - how big a file can be parsed on average computers?
16:54  iszak: hmm
16:54  iszak: no idea.
16:54  d3c: alright
16:57  hdon: d3c, the overhead for JSON is not really linear with the JSON source size. {{{{{}}}}} is much denser than {foo:"bar"}

17:04  stongo: RTPMatt: ok, I never even thought of trying $(document).parent() ... it's worth a try
17:05  ||cw: stongo: in plan ol' JS, the parent object refers the frames parent's document object

17:18  RTPMatt: hi
17:18  stongo: RTPMatt, that's why I'm stuck trying to traverse up from the frame I guess
17:19  BlackSmurph: I'm having a real hard time with the dialog in the UI. The problem is that I'm adding new elements via javascript, and they all have a div inside that needs to only show on a click event (and the object to click is also being added on the fly)
17:19  BlackSmurph: (and I want that div to be in the dialog)
17:20  snsei: RTPMatt - thx! I must be doing something else wrong because that isn't working for me.
17:21  snsei: I'm using <form id='myForm'> and $('#myForm').trigger('reset') and nothing is happening
17:23  ZUZ3L: Hi guys...
17:23  BlackSmurph: Hi, ZUZ3L
17:23  ZUZ3L: Hi... A simple question... You mind?
17:24  BlackSmurph: I'll give it a go if I can.
17:24 --- sgtd_ is now known as sgtd
17:24  ZUZ3L: I want to remove texts within <A>'s in a <DIV> called controls. (".controls").text().hide(); .... why doesn't it work?
17:24  RTPMatt: snsei> seems to work for me.  maybe console.log() your selector to make sure you are actually getting the form
17:25  BlackSmurph: remove completely?
17:25  ZUZ3L: Or just hide it...
17:25  RTPMatt: (".controls").text() returns the actual text, not the node with the text
17:25  losing: ZUZ3L: dont do text().hide()
17:25  BlackSmurph: $('.controls a').html('');
17:25  losing: just hide()
17:25  Techdeck: hey guys, does anyone know if I can make an input (of type 'text') unchangable? I want it so once someone focuses on it, it will simply highlight the text so he can copy it
17:25  Techdeck: but I don't want him to be able to change it
17:25  snsei: RTPMatt - I'll keep at it...it's probably something simple I've missed.  Thanks again.
17:26  losing: $('input').attr('readonly', 'readonly');
17:26  RTPMatt: sure thing
17:26  Dreamer3: Techdeck: what losing said
17:26  Techdeck: thank you losing
17:26  barraponto: i want to limit list elements to a  given height and add a "more" button on the li that area greater than the height, expanding it to full size.
17:26  barraponto: can i select by height?
17:26  barraponto: $('ul li').maxheight('5em') or something like this?
17:26  ZUZ3L: > blacksmurph... it doesn't work...
17:26  hsbot:   <no location info>: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
17:27  losing: barraponto: I would add a class to the li that specifies the height
17:27  Techdeck: it there a way to make it so when he focuses on it, I will highlight the line?
17:27  ZUZ3L: It should make the text disapear?
17:27  BlackSmurph: why not hide the whole a tag?
17:27  ZUZ3L: Because I need the "container" that the link is, to show background-image.

17:28  ZUZ3L: Now the text is at top, so I want to hide the text, but keep the <A>
17:28  sean`: I just looked at code I wrote at the beginning of this year
17:28  barraponto: losing: i need to add a button only to the elements greater than 5em. are you suggesting i should test each and add a class on the ones that are greater?
17:28  sean`: And Oh My God, I've learned so much
17:28  mdel: hey all... is there a way in js to capture a window.location change?
17:28  losing: barraponto: how are you making them 5em?
17:29  mdel: I have a flash piece that does a redirect, and I'd like to change this to use ajax without tweaking the flash
17:29  barraponto: no, if they're shorter i leave them the way they are. i only limit them to 5em if they need to.
17:29  ZUZ3L: I guess I could. i just tourght that you could hide .text() ... that ain't possible?
17:29  barraponto: no, if they're shorter i leave them the way they are. i only limit them to 5em if they need to be limited..
17:29  barraponto: losing: maybe i could use a max-height.
17:29  barraponto: losing: and take it out on more.
17:29  barraponto: losing: and take it out when "more" is clicked on.
17:29  HarryPitfall: there is a new version of jquery?
17:29  losing: 1.4.4
17:29  HarryPitfall: i didn't know
17:30  HarryPitfall: also UI gets updated?
17:30  HarryPitfall: i want to see the changelog

17:30  HarryPitfall: :3
17:30  BlackSmurph: any idea on the dynamic dialog boxes?
17:31  barraponto: losing: then, how should i add the "more" button only on the elements larger than 5em?
17:31  ZUZ3L: Thank you BlackSmurph... I'm trying to find out a solution... Thanks for your try... :)
17:32  BlackSmurph: No problem. Glad I could help.
17:32  ZUZ3L: Sorry!!
17:33  BlackSmurph: I assume you're using something like <div ...> blah blah <a ...> </a></div
17:33  ZUZ3L: I worked now... I just needed to change what script was first...

17:46  mdel: ugh i hate flash
17:46  Michael: Why?
17:46  mdel: Michael: besides the obvious... ?
17:46  Michael: I don't see anything obvious to hate about flash
17:47  mdel: Michael: look harder ;0
17:47  Michael: Er, no.
17:47  RTPMatt: it runs terrible on my linux compy =(
17:47  Michael: A lot of people just hop on the bandwagon with no real good reason to hateit.
17:47  mdel: how about this - flash doesn't expose the events it fires to the page
17:47  Michael: Personally I enjoy AS3
17:47  mdel: no way to catch them
17:47  RTPMatt: makes it overheat and shut off
17:48  Michael: You do that through ExternalInterface
17:48  Michael: So yes it can.
17:48  mdel: Michael: perhaps inside of AS, yeah
17:48  Michael: So?
17:48  mdel: but if it isn't developed with that in mind, then there is no way to interface
17:48  Michael: Does SilverLight or Unity 3D or any other browser plugin do that?
17:48  Jonz: no and they all suck for the same reason
17:48  Michael: I don't think that issue is flash specific
17:48  mdel: Michael: i dont care, honestly
17:48  Michael: Well you can do what you just said in AS3.
17:49  Michael: So next reason I should hate flash? :)
17:49  mdel: it has nothing to do with AS3
17:49  Michael: What you just described can be achieved by using ExternalInterface.
17:49  mdel: external plugins in general are isolated from the browser unless they are designed to specifically fire/catch events
17:49  Jonz: flash is rife with security holes
17:49  mdel: Michael: you mentioned that
17:49  mdel: Jonz: +1
17:49  Michael: Sounds like an overall architecture issue of plugins
17:49  Michael: Not really flash
17:49  mdel: Michael: indeed
17:50  Michael: I know I mentioned that. u mad bro?
17:50  Michael: So that is not specific to flash.
17:50  mdel: Michael: not particularly
17:50  Jonz: "u mad bro", are u serious
17:50  mdel: Michael: glad you like flash so much ;)
17:50  mdel: enjoy :)
17:50  Michael: Thank you
17:50  mdel: JAGERBOMBZ
17:50  mdel: bro
17:51  Michael: Too many people follow others. "I hate flash because... er... because it's the trendy thing to do?"
17:51  Jonz: flash is a closed standard
17:51  mdel: Michael: ha
17:51  Jonz: flash is full of security flaws
17:51  mdel: yeah its trendy to hate the closed, bloated platform called flash
17:51  Michael: Like what?
17:51  Jonz: i don't know what more you need..
17:51  Michael: osflash.org
17:52  Jonz: i honestly am not a security expert, but everytime I have to do mandatory software updates, it seems like it's because it's a patch for flash
17:52  mdel: don't be mad, 'bro', just because people dislike a dying technology you have spent a lot of time learning
17:52  Michael: I'm not mad.
17:52  mdel: AS3 is nice, I agree
17:52  Michael: I'm ripping apart your shallow ideas of flash. It seems you don't really understand it and choose to hate it.
17:52  Michael: It's an easy and common technology to target and I like to hear peoples reasons
17:53  mdel: ha. i understand it pretty well considering I have to develop flash pieces from time to time
17:53  Michael: I'm not all pro flash. I'm just not against it
17:53  Michael: You're responding like a 10th grader :P
17:53  Michael: Guess that is a problem with IRC
17:53  mdel: sorry, bro
17:54  Michael: wel they're ignored lol
17:55  Jonz: so Michael, externalinterface will fix the issue where flash steals control of the keyboard from the tab, and you can't do things like switch tabs, copy/paste or other menu type functions of the browser?
17:55  Michael: Someone just googled
17:56  Jonz: ?
17:56  Michael: ExternalInterface exposes AS3 methods to JS
17:56  asc: how do I connect from a draggable to a sortable if the sortable gets inserted into the dom?
17:56  Michael: What's his face mentioned not being able to capture events fired
17:56  Michael: That has nothing to do with anything you just mentioned.
17:57  aljosa: with jquery 1.4.4 in chrome i'm getting "[object DOMWindow]" for $(element).offset().top but i get int for $(element).offset().left althought it works in firefox where i get an int.  same thing for "position().top", any idea why?
17:57  Michael: You just picked various pieces of what I typed and strung them together out of context, and then asked me a question about what you created
17:57  Michael: aljosa, hmm haven't tried that
17:58  Jonz: michael, make sure you look at the name of the commenter, i feel like you're mixing three of us together, i'm just trying to have a conversation and you're turning it into an argument or competition..

19:16  wasabi: But of course, putting it on top of the other, kills the hover event

19:58  Cork[home]: wasabi: something like this should work $(selector).bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function() { $(this).data('mousestate', event.type); });
19:58  carpii: yes, its calling a php script, and the header im setting seems to be taking effect
19:59  RTPMatt: JuJuBee> $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", 'yyyy-mm-dd' );
19:59  Cork[home]: carpii: time for some http logging then :)
19:59  carpii: i am already :(
19:59  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: thanks I will try that.
19:59  carpii: i should be able to access jquery from within the response script right ?
19:59  RTPMatt: np
19:59  carpii: like $("#div").html(etc)
20:00  Cork[home]: carpii: as long as the ajax call happens after domready; yes
20:00  carpii: yes it does
20:00  carpii: should i be wrapping a <script> tag around my response ?
20:00  Cork[home]: no
20:00  carpii: ok
20:00  carpii: thx, ill dig some more
20:00  JuJuBee: RTPMatt:  it is 'yy-mm-dd' btw
20:01  JuJuBee: thanks for the tip
20:01  Cork[home]: carpii: try something like $.ajax({ url:'/testscript.js', dataType: 'script' });
20:01  Cork[home]: carpii: that should work
20:01  wasabi: So this is odd. I have an element that .fadeTo doesn't seem tow ork out.
20:01  carpii: thats kinda what im doing
20:01  carpii: $.ajax({ url: "/ajaxhandler.php", data: "user="+username+"&fav=" + add, dataType: "script" });
20:02  carpii: and the params are valid
20:02  Cork[home]: carpii: i meant call a static script .js file, and see if that works
20:02  carpii: ah
20:02  carpii: oki
20:02  Cork[home]: carpii: then work from there
20:05  wasabi: I have <span><a>foo</a></span>   Should calling span.fadeTo(250, 0); not work?
20:06  ravenzz: $('span').fadeTo(250,0);
20:07  wasabi: yeah. I clearly have a reference to the right object, because setting .css('visibility', 'hidden') on it causes it to blink away.
20:07  wasabi: but fadeTo seems to have no effect.
20:08  Cork[home]: wasabi: not sure how well fade work on inline elements
20:08  Cork[home]: (can't say i've ever used fadeTo though)
20:08  wasabi: Hmm
20:08  wasabi: Ahh that might be the issue.
20:08  wasabi: Yup
20:08  antlong: is it possible to view the contents of a browsers js error console through jquery?
20:08  ravenzz: try with 'slow' instead of 250
20:09  Cork[home]: antlong: no
20:09  antlong: Cork[home], is it possible at all
20:09  ravenzz: $('span').hide().fadeTo('slow',0);
20:09  Cork[home]: antlong: you can catch errors with try catch though
20:09  Cork[home]: try {} catch(e) {}
20:09  antlong: Cork[home], im looking to poll the console for errors
20:09  Cork[home]: antlong: can't happen
20:10  Cork[home]: antlong: that would be a securyte leak
20:10  Cork[home]: *security
20:10  antlong: Cork[home], i would think reading the contents would be allowed
20:10  Cork[home]: antlong: i wouldn't as most browsers shows errors for all sites open in the browser
20:10  ravenzz: anthony_ maybe the jquery .error
20:10  ravenzz: should help you
20:11  Cork[home]: thats only the same as wrapping everything you run in try catch
20:11  antlong: Cork[home], im not actually running the Js directly, its being done through selenium
20:12  Cork[home]: antlong: not sure what selenium is
20:12  antlong: Cork[home], test automation framework
20:12  temp01: antlong: you can use window.onerror event which fires whenever an error occurs
20:12  carpii: if i specify a relative url when making an ajax call, is it relative to the document url, or to the url the script was fetched form ?
20:13  Cork[home]: carpii: to the current document
20:13  carpii: ok thanks
20:15  hdon: $.fn.map filters an item out if it's null!
20:16  Cork[home]: hdon: uh.. why would you care for a null value after map?
20:16  hdon: Cork[home], why would i *ever* care for a null value?
20:16  Cork[home]: hdon: good question
20:17  hdon: Cork[home], after an Array.prototype.map() i expect the indexes of the result array to correspond to the indexes of the base array. however, don't get me wrong, this is a great feature, just also a nasty surprise
20:18  EnlightenMental: anyone know if jquery has anything for building a frameset?  I want to write up some code to take external links, and open them in a frameset created by jquery and add some static html to the "header" for navigating back to the main site
20:18  hdon: :O
20:18  hdon: :O :O :O
20:18  hdon: EnlightenMental, what?
20:19  EnlightenMental: hdon: lol...  open external links into a frameset using jquery
20:19 * hdon detects a troll
20:19  wasabi: Cool. That works. Seems like the image I'm fading in loses it's alpha channel (it's a transparent png) though.
20:19  wasabi: On IE 8
20:19  BlackSmurph: $(this).append('<frameset><frame ...></frameset>'); ?
20:20  Cork[home]: wasabi: ie?
20:20  EnlightenMental: $(a).each { chck if the link is external } onclick { append a frameset } open external link in frameset } etc
20:20  ajpiano: why in gods name would you ever want to do something
20:20  ajpiano: that convoluted
20:20  Cork[home]: wasabi: known bug, in ie7 and ie8
20:20  BlackSmurph: or $('frameset').append('<frame src="foo">');
20:20  carpii: sounds nefarious
20:20  karega: is there anything comparable to morph ini jQuery?
20:20  Cork[home]: wasabi: if you want to use opacity in ie, don't use alpha cannel
20:20  BlackSmurph: or prepend if you're feelin squirrely
20:20  EnlightenMental: yeah.. i dont know if this is the best pracitce
20:20  erichynds: EnlightenMental, no need for each() there
20:21  Cork[home]: *channel
20:21  karega: ajpiano,
20:21  karega: docs
20:21  EnlightenMental: ok, i assume you guys understand my idea... is this best practice? or should i keep reading :-P
20:22  erichynds: framesets aren't best practice
20:22  EnlightenMental: but theyre still used by many big sites right?
20:22  ajpiano: EnlightenMental: you should run as far as you can in the opposite direction from frames and framesets
20:22  Cork[home]: ya, framesets is a really bad idea
20:22  erichynds: no
20:22  ajpiano: kind of like how TIME has done the same thing
20:22  carpii: or hop in a time machine back to 1992 and embrace them
20:22  EnlightenMental: lol
20:23  EnlightenMental: monsterjobs.com <= click on a job, click to view employer website, it "appears" to be framed
20:23  EnlightenMental: ^ there are many sites "like" this... are they not frames?
20:23  hdon: EnlightenMental, almost certainly not
20:24  carpii: what makes you say thats using frames ?
20:24  hdon: EnlightenMental, the one notable exception is the invasive frameset used by search engines to keep you on their website when you follow, say, a google images search
20:24  EnlightenMental: then some php fopen() ?
20:24  EnlightenMental: hdon: ok, gotcha.. that makes sense
20:24  EnlightenMental: I for sure want to use best practice.. and not reinvent anything
20:25  EnlightenMental: if its not frames is it server side stuff then?
20:25  asc: I still have a problem with dragging and dropping into sortables contained in different tabs.... :(
20:25  dinosaadeh: guys anyone worked with http://www.wordimpressed.com/coding/jflow-plus-auto-slide-examples-demo-and-tips/ I am not able to add more than three slides =/ this is insane
20:25  hdon: EnlightenMental, a frame is only useful for isolating different pages in the same view
20:25  asc: it works fine when not in a tab
20:25  hdon: EnlightenMental, if all you want to do is load content dynamically, there are many options, the simplest of which is $(..).load(url)
20:26  EnlightenMental: .c load
20:26  EnlightenMental: this channel have codex hotlinks?
20:26  EnlightenMental: must not
20:26  hdon: ?load
20:26  bot-t: .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
20:26  trave: im loading jquery and jqueryui from the CDN, but for some reason I am getting:  Object #<an Object> has no method 'accordian' ... any suggestions?
20:26  asc: why would switcihng to a different tab lose the ability to drop into a sortable in the pane
20:26  ravenzz: trave jsfiddle.net it
20:27 * hdon yearns for the day when saying "fiddle" is preferable to saying "jsfiddle.net"
20:27  hdon: EnlightenMental, did you get the link?
20:28  EnlightenMental: from the bot? yeah
20:28 * hdon nods
20:28  EnlightenMental: just trying to understand how i'd use it
20:28  erichynds: that is a load event, not ajax load
20:28  trave: ravenzz, its a pretty heavy page, i just came on the project as a contractor... i'll strip it down, and probably find the conflict, but if not i'll put it up in that fiddle :]
20:30  EnlightenMental: so, when an external link is clicked, jquery intercepts, opens a modal, with "my site" at the top, and uses .load to load the external url below... or something :-P
20:30  BillCriswell: Hmmm... am I late to the jquerymobile party?
20:30  BillCriswell: I just found out about it today.
20:31  hdon: EnlightenMental, "external links" are URLs to other websites?
20:31  EnlightenMental: yes
20:31  hdon: EnlightenMental, very tacky
20:31  emanu: I need some opinions: I have to build some charts in my web app and have been looking into the google visualization API.  It looks simple and ideal, is there any caveats I'm missing? Is there any reason for anybody to advise against it?
20:31  EnlightenMental: its only for a certain demographic of external links.. not all
20:32  EnlightenMental: hdon:  real estate company.. agents can post a link to their external site.. so im only hijacking those.. not all
20:32  freedgy: Hey all - I'm using .click() on a button. Wondering if there is a jquery feature to momentairily disable the click event for this element? My other options would be hiding the button, or removing the click event. Maybe something I could add to disable any event listeners until another function says it's ok to proceed. Any ideas?
20:33  hdon: EnlightenMental, using .load() will not work out-of-the-box for cross-domain locations. i think there's an option you can set to have it use an iframe transport instead of XHR
20:33  EnlightenMental: hdon: k, so ;load is still the best method? if so, i'll start reading up on it
20:33  ravenzz: EnlightenMental for cross-domain you can use jsonp
20:33  hdon: EnlightenMental, still sounds tacky to me :P
20:33  ravenzz: if you are able to get data in that format
20:34  hdon: EnlightenMental, i don't know i haven't done cross-domain requests with jquery yet. if jquery is like dojo then what i am saying is true.
20:34  ravenzz: also you can write a kind of php-proxy
20:34  hdon: EnlightenMental, you'll have to ask someone else if jquery can use an iframe transport
20:34  ravenzz: and call it with ajax
20:34  EnlightenMental: k
20:34  seenoevil: if an event handler is not registered inside of $(document).ready() it will not work?
20:34  EnlightenMental: ideally, I just a very user friendly way to not loose people to the "agent sites"
20:34  seenoevil: I am trying to understand js loading, etc.
20:34  EnlightenMental: *want
20:35  hdon: ravenzz, EnlightenMental doesn't control the remote domains. the data won't be json. does that matter for the jsonp dataType?
20:35  ravenzz: yes may be the matter
20:36  RTPMatt: seenoevil: it can work, it depends.  If you put the handler below the element it should work
20:36  hdon: seenoevil, if you use something like $(selector) before the DOM is ready, then the result of $(selector) will be an empty set, and your handlers will be added to no elements
20:36  ravenzz: depends on which website he's trying to query
20:36 * EnlightenMental wonders if fopen() and pure php in an external-loader.php file would be easier
20:36  hdon: ravenzz, he just wants to load pages cross-domain. he should probably use an iframe.
20:36  ravenzz: if you will have a low load you can choose for the php proxy solution
20:36  seenoevil: hdon: RTPMatt makes sense! I have the event handler defined in <head>... d'oh. I am going to put load the js last
20:36  hdon: EnlightenMental, thought about an iframe?
20:36  ravenzz: hdon he can
20:36  EnlightenMental: hdon:  isnt that equally as tacky?
20:36  ravenzz: but loosing control on data
20:36 --- cpg|away is now known as cpg
20:37  EnlightenMental: i pondered an iframe and JS to dynamically resize it
20:37  EnlightenMental: seemed dirty
20:37  ravenzz: yes EnlightenMental
20:37  hdon: EnlightenMental, "tacky" describes the idea of embedding one website view in the view of another website, not the technology that makes it happen
20:37  hdon: seenoevil, why aren't you using .ready()?
20:37  EnlightenMental: true..  by how many of us would want to admit we're rockin' iframes
20:37  EnlightenMental: :-P
20:38  hdon: seenoevil, you're doing things wrong if you are trying to work around $(document).ready()
20:38  hdon: EnlightenMental, it is the right technology for your application. the tastefulness of your application is between you and your god
20:38  seenoevil: hdon: I am not trying to work around it necessarily, I just wasn't sure. is the best practice to register all handlers inside of $(document).ready?
20:38  hdon: seenoevil, yes
20:39  EnlightenMental: hdon: fair enough
20:39  hdon: seenoevil, you should not attempt to access the DOM outside of .ready() or its precipitants
20:39  RTPMatt: seenoevil: it depends. if your scripts are at the top of the page then yes, if you put them at the bottom though, probably not
20:39 * hdon rolls his eyes
20:39  seenoevil: is that guaranteed behavior? bottom of page?
20:39  RTPMatt: hdon: I hardly think that is a fair statement
20:39  hdon: it wasn't a statement at all
20:40  RTPMatt: seenoevil: it they exist in the DOM, before you attach them you do not need .ready
20:40  RTPMatt: *if
20:40  seenoevil: exist in DOM = defined before js code?
20:40  RTPMatt: is, if you put your scripts at the bottom of the page, they WILL work without .ready
20:41  seenoevil: Ok, I see.
20:41  seenoevil: I would just rather not clutter up $(document).ready() with a million event handlers :P
20:41  brianpWins: Is there a name for when you have a container on your page somewhere and when you scroll it attches to the top of the scroll area ?
20:41  seenoevil: brianpWins: sticky header/footer?
20:41  hdon: seenoevil, keep in mind that for .ready() there is no fear of "missing" the ready event. after the page is *already* ready, any call to $(document).ready(f) will fire f immediately. read up http://api.jquery.com/ready/
20:41  seenoevil: hdon: thanks
20:42  brianpWins: seenoevil: that would probably do it. ima google now =)
20:42  hdon: brianpWins, i call them annoying (when used with ads;)
20:42  brianpWins: hdon: lol ;)
20:42  carpii: you can have multiple document ready, also
20:42  hdon: carpii, ?
20:42  seenoevil: carpii: oh? is it additive?
20:42  seenoevil: how does that possible?
20:42  seenoevil: is that possible*
20:43  carpii: magic :D
20:43  hdon: carpii, please explain
20:43  RTPMatt: .ready is a queue, the first .reay that is encountered is the first one that will execute when the page is ready
20:43  RTPMatt: the last one will execute last
20:43  hdon: oh
20:43  hdon: that is a more obvious interpretation
20:43  hdon: versus my ridiculous interpretation: that there could be multiple documents manipulated via jquery
20:44  hdon: that all ready at different times
20:44 * hdon feels silly
20:44  carpii: heh
20:44  brianpWins: I keep finding fixed table headers. Anyone have a link to one the know/like ?
20:44  diamonds: anyone know of a blog post stepping thru jquery bbq? I've read thru http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/ but am not sure I totally understand it /cc ben_alman
20:44  hdon: carpii, i explained as much a moment ago with the remark about "missing" the ready event.
20:44  hdon: which is why i thought you were saying something different, i think
20:44 * hdon saves face
20:44  carpii: ok i wasnt following the chan, im just dipping in and out
20:45  hdon: C:
20:45  carpii: diamonds, which bit dont you follow?
20:45  RTPMatt: it is all good
20:45  hdon: diamonds, lol, i just implemented something exactly like bbq
20:45  carpii: ive used bbq a little, but i didnt find the examples that useful either
20:45  RTPMatt: i prefer days where i learn something new ;)
20:45  diamonds: carpii: one moment
20:46 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
20:46  hdon: diamonds, i wrote a "dialogue" abstraction of GUI state that is used. you can hit back/forward. and you can also hit "favorite" which serializes the dialogue and saves it on the server so it can be recalled later (like saving an email draft in gmail)
20:46  xid: my mouseout() function is on the wrapper that contains the dropwdown but it's behaving like it's on the label instead, causing the drop-down to disappear prematurely
20:46  xid: using hide() inside my mouseout()
20:47  drubies: got a dynamic form where the user can enter as many children as they want... http://pastie.org/1320889 is only working sometimes for the first child added, never for anymore, and sometimes an exception is raised... any ideas?
20:47  diamonds: carpii: I guess I don't want to use .load because there are disparate elements that need updating
20:47  hdon: ?mouseleave
20:47  bot-t: .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
20:47  carpii: xid, maybe you could catch mouseout on the label and e.preventDefault ?
20:47  xid: thanks for the tips
20:48  diamonds: I should probably just TIAS but I wanted to try to read/research a bit more before I attempt to integrate it into an existing project
20:48  carpii: or use mouseenter and mouseleave
20:48  carpii: the event propagation differs for those
20:48  xid: cool that maks more sense
20:48  carpii: but i dont recall the specifics
20:48  carpii: diamonds, not sure sorry. I only used bbq for serialising the ajax into a hash, so back button would work
20:48  diamonds: the tutorial is clear... I just feel like there's something I'm missing :/
20:49 --- emanu_ is now known as emanu
20:49  hdon: if xid's problem is that the mouseout event is firing on a child element of the element he bound the handler to
20:50  hdon: then he needs mouseleave
20:50  hdon: xid, did you get the link from bot-t?
20:50  hdon: ?mouseleave
20:50  bot-t: .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
20:50  hdon: "This event type can cause many headaches due to event bubbling. For instance, when the mouse pointer moves out of the Inner element in this example, a mouseout event will be sent to that, then trickle up to Outer. This can trigger the bound mouseout handler at inopportune times. See the discussion for .mouseleave() for a useful alternative."
20:50  seenoevil: is "load all js after page elements" specified/standard behavior? or is just relying on the behavior most browsers exhibit when loading elements/js?
20:50  hdon: seenoevil, what context?
20:50  seenoevil: "load all js after page elements" as in not using something like onload or $(document).ready
20:50  hdon: seenoevil, what are you quoting?
20:51  seenoevil: myself? (i think...)
20:51  hdon: just use .ready()
20:51  hdon: this is sooooo not complicated at all
20:51  xid: strange it captures the mouseout event, but not the mouseleave event
20:52  drubies: tried both techniques in: http://pastie.org/1320889.... datepicker is failing w/ #live after the 3rd new input field... almost consistently
20:52  hdon: xid, mouseleave is not an event in browser parlance. it is an invention of jquery, emulating a proprietary IE feature
20:52  drubies: advice welcome :)
20:53  xid: strange mouseout triggers, but not the mouseleave
20:53  hdon: xid, sto psaying that
20:54  rindolf: Hi all.
20:54  xid: well, i worded it differently because you took qualms with my using the term "event"
20:54  xid: whatever the case, I'm stumped
20:54  hdon: xid, fair enough. i also, however, explained that this is the single distinction between mouseout and mouseleave earlier.
20:54  hdon: it is why jquery has mouseleave
20:55  xid: looking at scrolback
20:55  hdon: sorry i must have said it right after i sent you to the mouseleave page
20:55  diago: how can I test if an object has a dialog attached already?
20:55  sean`: oi
20:55  sean`: diago, $('element').dialog ('widget')
20:55 * hdon wishes for a #jquery-ui
20:56  sean`: hdon, why? this channel also supporgts jquery ui
20:56  sean`: there was a channel for jquery ui but it was abondoned, as a lot of people came here
20:56  diago: sean`: thanks
20:56  juha_: is there channel for sean fanboys?
20:56  sean`: or.. diago .data ('dialog') I think
20:56  xid: there's no child in the mix, i can't even get an alert() to fire
20:56  serio: #iamgayforsean
20:56  hdon: sean`, i understand how it might be the case that it's more convenient for most people to have them be the same channel. but i end up reading a lot of questions having no idea what the answer is :(
20:57  sean`: hdon, you don't need to know all the answers
20:57  juha_: serio: whoaa nice
20:57  sean`: that's how you keep learning
20:57  xid: http://staging.kartiniclinic.com/test
20:57  serio: you mean, you learn by reading!?
20:57  serio: facinating.
20:57  xid: see the little drop-down on the left side
20:57  xid: in the form
20:58  sean`: serio, <3
20:58  hdon: sean`, no, but if i am gonna keep an eye on the channel to help people, it would be personally more efficient for me to only have to read questions i know the answers to, or as close as i can get to only those questions :)
20:58  serio: but, but but but
20:58  serio: I dunno how to readz
20:58 * hdon consideres the value of seeing other people's questions' answers
20:58  sean`: hdon, I'm assuming you're just kidding
20:58  xid: there is a mouseleave() on .webform-component-select not being triggered
20:58  hdon: a little
20:59  xid: mouseout() works
20:59  xid: I'm sorry if you explained why already, I didn't understand.
20:59  sean`: xid, you want to hide the select on mouseout/leave>?
20:59  serio: wtf is mouseleave?
20:59  sean`: ?mouseleave @ serio
20:59  bot-t: serio, .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
20:59  sean`: Yuo shoouldn't do taht, you should use a bind on clickoutside
20:59  hdon: ?clickoutside
20:59  bot-t: hdon, clickoutside | jQuery Plugins - On click outside of an element executes a callback. It can be attached to multiple elements. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/click-outside
20:59  xid: yeah I think I need to upgrade jquery
20:59  xid: using the stock Drupal 6 jquery
20:59  xid: mousleave is not a function

21:00  sean`: were at 1.4.4
21:00  xid: wonder if mouseleave is the solution
21:00  hdon: the clickoutside plugin page doesn't have docs?
21:00  xid: sean`: clickoutside you say though?  ok... thanks. I'm new in case you couldn't tell.
21:00  serio: mouseleave is not a function, it's an event.
21:00  sean`: xid, it's part of a plugin
21:00  xid: good
21:01  xid: sounds perfect
21:01  sean`: ?outside events
21:01  bot-t: sean`, jQuery outside events | jQuery Plugins - With jQuery outside events you can bind to an event that will be triggered only when a specific “originating” event occurs outside the element in question. For example, you can click outside, doubl... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-outside-events-plugin
21:01  serio: wait, it is a function? wtf BBQ?
21:01  sean`: serio, are yuou in holland? 'cause you be trippinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn'
21:01  hdon: serio, stop talking
21:01  serio: haha
21:01 * hdon hunts down a smoke
21:01  sean`: :p
21:02  serio: I wish I was trippin' in Holland.
21:02  sean`: :p
21:02  Jortuny: howdy. trying to use the jquery-ui tabs schtuff, when I try and do an .tabs('add', ...) for div on the page, it's throwing "Cannot read property 'parentNode' of undefined" and that makes me very sad ;-(
21:02  sean`: ?details @ Jortuny
21:02  bot-t: Jortuny, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
21:02  sean`: preferably jsfiddle as pastebin
21:03  serio: I <3 jsfiddle
21:03  serio: sean, you got public fiddles?
21:03  serio: you fiddle in public?
21:03  Jortuny: sean`: I was just hopeful someone would have heard of this happening before... reducing the code down to a testcase would be a nightmare. the tabs are added dynamically from an ajax call and filled with jqplot divs
21:03  sean`: serio, on my blog
21:03  sean`: Jortuny, show a live example?
21:03  Jortuny: sean`: can't do that either, running locally :-(
21:03  Jortuny: lemme try to reduce it a little bit
21:04  sean`: Jortuny, I don't care
21:04  sean`: just throw the code in a pasetbin
21:04  sean`: this is your lucky day
21:04  Jortuny: give me a sec :-)
21:04  Jortuny: hehe

21:05  aniasis: If I open jQuery UI's dialog from an iframe how do I get it to open in the top window?
21:05  b1lly: http://jsfiddle.net/L8SNK/ anyone see a problem?
21:05  Jortuny: sean`: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/dVJMv/
21:06  Jortuny: the 2nd div is me trying to add the content to another div to see if that fixed the problem
21:08  serio: b1lly, select jQuery fron the dropdown
21:08  sean`: Jortuny, $('#left_chart_'+i) what does that give you
21:09  sean`: also, Jortuny you're missing a label
21:09  Jortuny: i will be a string
21:09  sean`: oke
21:09  sean`: Jortuny, why not add first and tab later?
21:09  serio: b1lly, also, congrats on creating a loop, everytime you close the alert it re-focuses the radio
21:09  Jortuny: sean`: can I do tabs('add') without doing .tabs first?
21:10  b1lly: serio idk why it dont work on my webpage than lol
21:10  b1lly: cuz it works in jsfiddle
21:10  Jortuny: sean`: also, what label?
21:10  serio: b1lly, I don't know either man
21:10  b1lly: serio: im using on change
21:10  b1lly: now, just made it focus cuz change wasnt working
21:11  b1lly: i loaded the jquery file too idk why its not loading
21:11  northband: Brainstorm help needed - I would like to auto show random balloons w/ messages.  Say every 10 seconds one pops up for 5 sec then fades - the content of the balloon fetched via ajax.  Any examples out there or libs to consider?
21:11  sean`: Jortuny, .tabs ('add', URL, label [, index])
21:12  Jortuny: right
21:12  sean`: Jortuny, $('#left_chart_'+i) what does that give you
21:12  sean`: b1lly, use click
21:12  Jortuny: sean`: uh "[<div id=​"left_chart_poll_results" class=​"ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom ui-tabs-hide">​Loading​</div>​]"
21:12  Jortuny: (i in this case was "poll_results")
21:13  sean`: oke
21:13  sean`: Thansk, I figured that out myself
21:13  ProLoser|Work: hello
21:13  Woelfle: hey guys, what's the jQuery.fn object for?
21:13  Jortuny: :-p
21:13  ProLoser|Work: i'm getting a js error on line 1 char 1 http://isvtest.com/ and i have no idea why
21:13  ProLoser|Work: in ie
21:13  sean`: Woelfle, all those stuff that's in there is available when you use a selector
21:13  sean`: $('foo').foo () === $.fn.foo
21:13  b1lly: got it
21:14  b1lly: sean`: i was puting the script before the actual html
21:14  sean`: Jortuny, is $('#left_chart_tab_content') in the dom?
21:14  b1lly: didnt realize it had to be after, i had it in the head tags
21:14  sean`: b1lly, I still advice click
21:14  sean`: not focus, as they are two seperate thinsg
21:14  Jortuny: sean`: yeah, it is.
21:14  b1lly: sean`: click instead of change?
21:15  b1lly: sean`: i'm using change
21:15  b1lly: i only set it to focus to test because change wasn't working (which is what you see on jsfiddle)
21:15  b1lly: np thx anyway
21:15  Woelfle: sean` ah ok, to tell those functions apart from functions like $.inArray() etc?
21:16  sean`: Woelfle, yes
21:16  sean`: inArray is in $
21:16  sean`: but find is in $.fn
21:17  Woelfle: that makes sense. so am I right that .extend also allows DOM elements to be extended?
21:17  Woelfle: it says jQuery.extend = jQuery.fn.extend = function() in the source, so I guess that assumption is valid
21:17  sean`: Woelfle, that's for redundancy
21:18  sean`: Jortuny, it needs at least one element
21:19  sean`: or you should use an idnex
21:19  sean`: so i advice you to use the index parameter
21:19  Jortuny: ah, interesting. so I should just tack on a 0...n to the end?
21:19  sean`: an index
21:19  sean`: dunno what you're talking about, just add an index
21:19  sean`: that should work
21:20  Jortuny: sean`: doesn't work.
21:20  sean`: what's that lnie now
21:20  Jortuny: $('#left_chart_tabs').tabs('add', '#left_chart_'+i, i, j++);
21:20  Jortuny: (var j = 0; before the loop)
21:20  sean`: oke
21:20  sean`: try j = 1
21:20  Jortuny: heh ok
21:21  Jortuny: no love
21:21  sean`: ?
21:21  Jortuny: same error
21:21  sean`: can you traverse the error to: $panel.appendTo(this.list[0].parentNode) ?
21:21  Woelfle: sean` what d'you mean "it's for redundancy"? I just tried $("#13").extend({…stuff…}) but it didn't work
21:22  sean`: Woelfle, that's not for that
21:22  sean`: $.fn.extend is used to add stuff to $.fn
21:22  paul_irish_: SE-R-IO  SERIO SEEEEE RIIII OOOOOOOOHHHHHHH
21:22  serio: ah, what?
21:22  Jortuny: sean`: before I waste more time, lemme try adding the <li>s manually first
21:23  Woelfle: ah ok
21:23  Jortuny: since i know the full structure of the tabs beforehand
21:23  Jortuny: ('beforehand')
21:23  seutje: <3 it when paul_irish_ is in the shower and left his mic on
21:23  sean`: seutje, <3
21:26  Woelfle: so I'm making this html5 chess with jquery in which <td> elements represent fields and <div class="piece"> elements pieces. I ended up having tons of field-functions and tons of piece-functions, each of them having the element in question as first parameter. for better readability I want to make it more object oriented. does it make more sense to extend the elements themselves or is it wiser to inroduce a new kind of type that is elem
21:26  Jortuny: woooo, that worked. silly tabs.add
21:26  ProLoser|Work: i'm getting a js error on line 1 char 1 http://isvtest.com/ and i have no idea why in ie
21:27  sean`: Jortuny, see, you need to add first
21:27  sean`: have at least one
21:27  Jortuny: sean`: yeah. that seems a little silly, though. i'm sure it has its reasons
21:27  sean`: Jortuny, yeah, for initialisation
21:27  sean`: however, I do agree that it shouldn't be a problem
21:27  sean`: and it's easy to add compatibily tfor it
21:28  Zxurian: anyone know if jQuery has a function to check if a scrollbar is present in a div?
21:28  ajpiano: Woelfle, it doesn't make sense to extend the elements imo, it makes sense to create a Class, so to speak, that encapsulates the functionality of each piece, and has the element reference as a property
21:29  Zxurian: or a way to check if a div's content height is greater than the div's height itself?
21:29  sean`: Zxurian, yes
21:30  Woelfle: ajpiano I guess you're right. by "create a class" you simply mean function Field(element) = {}; and then field=new Field($("td[0]"))); ?
21:30  sean`: Zxurian, do your homework on stackoverflow
21:30  ajpiano: Woelfle: basically, yes
21:30  ajpiano: and then you can have a link between the element and the class, by storing the class reference in the .data() of the element
21:30  Woelfle: how do jquery objects achieve the array-like behaviour?
21:31  ajpiano: Woelfle this entire pattern is neatly encapsulated by thhe jqueryui widget factory
21:31  pk4r: Hello, how do I check if datepicker is visible/hidden ?
21:31  sean`: ?:visible @ pk4r
21:31  bot-t: pk4r, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
21:31  pk4r: Can't find any related attribute changes upon showing/hiding it.. is(":visible") also doesn't work.
21:32  Jonz: woelfle, this might be of interest to you http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
21:32  pk4r: Since .datepicker('show') doesn't change visibility, it acts somehow magically. Anybody has experience with that ?
21:32  Woelfle: Jonz thx, I'll have a look at that
21:33  Woelfle: ajpiano you mean the jquery widget core provides a way to "extend" elements with new attributes/methods without actually touching the dom?
21:33 --- seenoevil is now known as electricfeel
21:33  ajpiano: Woelfle, basically... yes
21:33  ajpiano: have you used jQuery UI at all
21:33  Woelfle: yes, the draggable and droppable interactions
21:34  Woelfle: but not any widgets
21:34  ajpiano: works the same way basically
21:34  WinegumS: can someone point me in the right direct ( i have comment the problem) I think it must be kinda of a simple answer but 2 days so far and i dont know, thanks -> http://pastebin.com/jsUihATh
21:36  Zxurian: I have done google / stackoverflow searches, and can't find any jquery / crossbrowser ways. Only ones I've found relate to the body, not an individual div
21:37  Woelfle: ajpiano is there some kind of documentation/tutorial about the widget core? the only thing I see in the jquery ui docs are widgets made with that core
21:37  danheberden: Zxurian: the tutorials are out there - you have to check the height of an inner div againt the height of the scrolling one
21:38  danheberden: if the height of the inner is higher, it's scrolling
21:38  danheberden: well, not scrolling but has a scrollbar
21:38  danheberden: ?g detect scrollbar javascript
21:38  bot-t: danheberden, How can I detect a Scrollbar presence ( using Javascript ) in HTML ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/681087/how-can-i-detect-a-scrollbar-presence-using-javascript-in-html-iframe
21:38  Zxurian: meh, I was aware of that, just wasn't sure if there was a way to do it wihout calculating the content hieight inside of the div or not
21:38  ajpiano: Woelfle, i'm working on doing some docs and evang for ui widget factory... as it is now, there are some articles and stuff you can look at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget-factory - http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/tips-for-developing-jquery-ui-widgets/ - http://addyosmani.com/blog/jqueryuicoverflow/
21:38  danheberden: Zxurian: ahh - yeah, its a pain

21:47  ajpiano: that's from some slides i'm retooling
21:47  ajpiano: if you don't think that automatically setting up a $.fn plugin, taking care of merging user options, storing the instance, prvoding multiple calling styles, evented architecture for callbacks/options changes etc,
21:47  ajpiano: is "saving you work"
21:47  ajpiano: then i don't know what "Saving you work" would consist of

21:48  erichynds: widget factory is the dopest
21:48  serio: getting you to do it instead?
21:48  erichynds: thanks +1
21:48  serio: it would save me work if ajpiano did it.
21:49  Woelfle: ^^
21:50  WinegumS: hm did my problem fool you all also!
21:50  Woelfle: I'm just not yet sure if it isn't overkill. I like the standalone fact. looks good, but let me see whether I need at least some of the stuff first ;)
21:50  erichynds: thats dangerously close to a wat
21:50  erichynds: Woelfle, the widget factory isn't even 2kb iirc
21:51  ajpiano: Woelfle: i guarantee you that most of the stuff you will write will end up duplicating stuff the widget factory provides for you
21:51  ajpiano: so the question is like, what is overkill
21:51  ajpiano: is it "overkill" to have some feature that you don't take advantage of
21:51  ajpiano: or is it "overkill" to reinvent the wheel :)
21:51  Woelfle: true point
21:52  sean`: true
21:52  Woelfle: I don't get the second to fourth last points on your slide ajpiano
21:53  Woelfle: (easily exposed callbacks, sane default scoping and free pseudoselector)
21:53  ajpiano: Woelfle: easily expose callbacks... if you want the user to be able to run some code at certain times, providing their own callback
21:53  ajpiano: that's really easy
21:53  ajpiano: sane default scoping: when you write classes in js and then bind class emthods to elements, jquery mucks around with 'this' a lot
21:54  ajpiano: the widget factory makes sure that 'this' refers to the instance of the widget, always
21:54  Woelfle: who is "the user"? me, the developer, or the chessplayer using my application in the end?
21:54  ajpiano: so you have to putz around with scope less
21:54  sean`: Woelfle, you
21:54  Woelfle: good^^
21:54  ajpiano: Woelfle: you the developer...theoretically you might be developing a plugin for other people to use, so they need callbacks
21:54  ajpiano: free pseudoselector...the widget factory automatically gnerates a pseudoselector you can use
21:55  ajpiano: so if you did $.widget("woelfle.chesspice",{});  and then $("elem").chesspiece();
21:55  Cliyeh: hello, can someone pls help me on the collapsible tab jquery code.
21:55  ajpiano: you could do then query the dom by $(":chesspiece")
21:55  ajpiano: if you wanted
21:55 --- Jabberwock is now known as Michael
21:55  Cliyeh: is it possible to hide the loading tabs at start?
21:55  Woelfle: that sounds pretty cool indeed.
21:56  sean`: http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/foto/406dcae5_Pedobear_Hes_Everywhere_You_Want_Be_500x500.jpg
21:56  ajpiano: Woelfle: also like, the widget factory supports inheritance
21:56  ajpiano: so you could define a chesspeice widget, and then extend each different type of piece off of the base class
22:00  RTPMatt: Cliyeh: not sure exactly what you are asking, but you could always set their style to display: none

22:13  jpenny: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion has a missing dependency.  Also depends on widgets.
22:14  ajpiano: every single widget in jquery ui depends on widgets
22:14  ajpiano: jpenny ah
22:14  ajpiano: it's technically "outdated"
22:14  ajpiano: widget used to be part of core
22:14  ajpiano: but is now broken out separately
22:14  ajpiano: i'll fix
22:15  ajpiano: <3
22:15  jpenny: Thanks, just my bug report of day.
22:15  trollboy: How different is the jquery ui package than the jquery core?
22:15  danheberden: as different as a car shell is to a car chassis?
22:15  ajpiano: danheberden DUDE
22:16  ajpiano: i was literally in the middle of thinking of that same analogy
22:16  danheberden: NICE
22:16  danheberden: i just stole your THOUGHTS
22:16  trollboy: danheberden, riiiiiiight.. but are we talking the shell of a porche and the chassis of a corvette?
22:16  jpenny: Not helpful, though.
22:16  trollboy: not really remotely
22:16  danheberden: trollboy: well one is built on the other
22:16  danheberden: jqueryui USES jquery core
22:17  ajpiano: trollboy: they're completely different things
22:17  trollboy: fair enough
22:17  danheberden: i mean, in their style their similar, if thats what you're after
22:17  jpenny: I am using because it adds special input/layout methods, accordion, datepicker, autocompleter
22:17  danheberden: both are bitchin' pieces of js
22:18  trollboy: danheberden,  not really
22:18  jpenny: see http://docs.jquery.com/Ui.  There are a lot of demos.
22:20  trollboy: No I use jquery UI jpenny but have had some issues, thus my question. Any variations that may be there/not there aren't affecting me directly (at least not as far as I know) so I'm not caring enough to continue trying to roll a car-shell/car-chassis analogy into some sort of recognizable answer on freenode, lol.  Thus my "fair enough"
22:20  jpenny: OK.
22:20  ajpiano: trollboy: are you asking about the fact that jquery ui rewrites a few jquery method signatures?
22:20  ajpiano: like destroy?
22:20  trollboy: ajpiano, not asking anything anymore.
22:20  ajpiano: ok
22:20  ajpiano: well
22:21  ajpiano: FYI, it does
22:21  trollboy: just going back to lurking
22:21  ajpiano: like, toggleClass, for instance
22:21  ajpiano: has a different method signature, if you drop in UI
22:21  NET||abuse:  ok, so i'm running jquery tmpl, i have in it,  {{each deal.details.highlights}} <li>${$value}</li> {{/each}}
22:21  NET||abuse: it's saying detail is undefined,
22:22  northband: Anyone know if this looks right - trying to fade in - delay - fade out an object: $('#balloon').hide().fadeIn().delay(1000).fadeOut();
22:23  trollboy: Is there an official jquery ui channel btw?  Last time I tried to #jqueryui it was empty, and #jquery-ui is invite only
22:23  NET||abuse: i've console.log(tmpl_data) before running tmpl, and deal.details is defined
22:23  ajpiano: trollboy: you're in it :)
22:23  northband: Keeps taking 1000ms to come in - whereas I want it to come in immediately, delay 1000 and immediately fade out.
22:24  trollboy: what time are the jquery ui guys usually in?
22:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o ajpiano]
22:24  tesseracter: northband, might need to put the delay and fade out in the completed callback of the fadeIn?
22:24  trollboy: I mean obviously you're in now

22:25  trollboy: shiny
22:25  danheberden: although they did borrow some techniques
22:25  danheberden: and some code
22:25  wasabi: Hmm.... so why might offset() not return the document position? Instead it's returning the position of the element two parents up.
22:25  wasabi: Actually, I take that back.
22:26  wasabi: Setting 'left' to 0 is not putting it in the right place either.
22:27  Bar_: How do I get the height including border ?
22:28 @ajpiano: trollboy: whaddya need to ask
22:28  erichynds: Bar_, get borders with css() and add to height
22:29  Bar_: erichynds: :\.... .css('border') will give me the color and style too right ?
22:30  sean`: trollboy, jquery mobile has some stuff frmo jqmobile
22:30  sean`: I mean, jqtouch
22:30 @ajpiano: trollboy: jquery mobile is also powered largely by ui
22:31  trollboy: I've been asking for some Jquery-ui help for about a week here on varying times, including pasting urls to see the examples.. no one really spoke up at all... other than to say they just do jquery and not jquery-ui (pepper expletives here)... so I ended up just using an iframe to get around my problem instead of doing it "the right way" if there is one for my issue.
22:31 @ajpiano: trollboy: what's the issue
22:31  trollboy: I generally prefer, when working with libraries, to do things the X way, were X is the library I'm using.  As it sits right now, I'm just aiming for "it works" with jquery
22:31  trollboy: I was trying to nest an accordian within a dialog
22:32 @ajpiano: i don't think we've encountered each other
22:32 @ajpiano: ok
22:32 @ajpiano: i've done that many times
22:32  trollboy: and the accordian wouldn't expand when I did that
22:32 @ajpiano: and never had that problem
22:32  erichynds: Bar_, do like .css("borderLeftWidth") - but that comes with unit's you'll need to strip out

22:33  erichynds: Bar_, so parseInt() that shitz
22:33  trollboy: I just put an iframe within my dialog now and pre-load the target before I call the dialog
22:33  Bar_: erichynds: Getting margin is the same ?
22:33  erichynds: Bar_, margin you can use outerHeight or outerWidth
22:33  Bar_: outerHeight(true) - outerHeight = margin-top+margin-bottom ?
22:33  erichynds: oh snap, looks liek those take account border too
22:33  erichynds: so i'm wrong
22:33  trollboy: ajpiano, as such I've kind of just taken to lurking here as opposed to asking... and my quickness to give up at the car chassis/car body thing.
22:34  erichynds: just use outerHeight(true)
22:34  northband: Hey Tess - thanks that worked - on to the next step.
22:34  Bar_: erichynds: That gives me the whole height I want only the margin
22:35  NET||abuse: ok,,, http://client2.test.featured.ie/   anyone know why this is happening?  details is not defined / [Break on this error] "');}return _;"
22:35  erichynds: then why didn't you say thayt in the first place
22:35 @ajpiano: trollboy, just give me a few mins, i'm on the phone but i'll look at it
22:35  erichynds: you said you want height incl. border
22:35  trollboy: but thanks though for your interest
22:35  karega: how can I retrieve the selected value from a select element?
22:35  trollboy: Its already "working" the wrong way and I'm good with that for the time being
22:35  karega: jQuery('#id').val() isn't working
22:36  erichynds: karega, have you verified your selector is matching an element?
22:36  deanclkclk___: hello everyone. Has anyone here used jqgrid?

22:37  deanclkclk___: ok..then
22:38  deanclkclk___: well...I am using JqGrid to render a list from my database
22:38  asc: how do i bind the contents of a dynamically added tab?
22:38  wasabi: Hmm. mouseover is still fired if the object is display: none.
22:38  wasabi: Anway to hide an element completely?
22:38  deanclkclk___: and I wanted to lock some record from edit...can this be done?
22:38  Bar_: erichynds: Sorry for that. How can I get only the margin ?
22:39  serio: deanclkclk___, do you have an example of a page where the ability to edit is enabled?
22:39  serio: like, live, perhaps?
22:39  deanclkclk___: sure...let me use pastebin
22:40  serio: no, I mean a place where I can see the thing rendered with the ability to edit.
22:41  deanclkclk___: here's the code http://pastebin.com/2nDG2Kn0
22:41  serio: anyways, just check the documentaion
22:41  serio: http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:common_rules
22:41  serio: {name:'price', ..., editable:true, edittype:'text', editoptions:{...}, editrules:{...}, formoptions:{...} },
22:42  serio: editable:true
22:42  deanclkclk___: @ serio
22:42  serio: hmmm
22:42  deanclkclk___: http://pastebin.com/2nDG2Kn0
22:42  deanclkclk___: it works..but, I just wanted to lock some rows from edit
22:42  erichynds: Bar_, parseInt( $("foo").css("margin-top"), 10 );
22:42  deanclkclk___: @ serio it works..but, I just wanted to lock some rows from edit
22:42  Bar_: erichynds: Thanks. the '10' at the end is a must ?
22:42  Bar_: it's not the default ?
22:43  erichynds: Bar_, no required but best practice
22:43  serio: deanclkclk___, just change editable:true to editable:false on the rows in question
22:43  erichynds: it's more of a habit
22:43  Bar_: Thanks!
22:43  serio: "The editable option is a boolean and can have a value of true or false. The option defines whether this field is editable (or not). Default is false. To make a field editable, set this option to true: editable:true."
22:44  serio: default is false, but all of yours are set to true.
22:44  serio: (or so it seems)

22:50  apollo13: hi, I do have a framework that uses jquery.noConflict(true), now I would like to reuse that jquery copy instead of using my own. I also use jquery.ui and it obviously complains about jQuery not beeing a function; what's the best way to proceed now?
22:53 --- snover is now known as snover|away
22:58  trollboy: apollo13, what versions?
22:58  apollo13: trollboy: jquery or ui? jquery is 1.4.2, ui is 1.8.something
22:59  trollboy: $.functionname() should work under jqueryui
22:59  apollo13: trollboy: well, looking at my custom build it expects jQuery to exist
22:59  trollboy: I typically just grab the ui bundle and use the jquery built into the package
22:59  apollo13: with noConflict(true) removes
23:00  Cliyeh: hello, can someone pls help me on the collapsible tab jquery code.
23:00  Cliyeh: is it possible to hide the loading tabs at start?
23:03  bkeating: offtopic: is it possible to embed code (<embed>) into a markdown field? Im trying to use MarkItUp! but i really need to be able to embed videos/html shits
23:11  wasabi: So is there any perfectly reliable way to set the position of one element to be exactly on top of another? position: absolute seems to sometimes not be based on the window offset.
23:12  JKarsrud: wasabi: Depends. If your container is set to position: relative, absolutely positioned children will be positioned absolutely within the container, not the viewport
23:12  wasabi: Yeah. I'm trying to write a jquery script that does a cross fade between two images... that I can reuse generally.
23:13  JKarsrud: Ahh
23:13  wasabi: but setting the position of the other image based on the base one doesn't seem to work reliably.
23:13  wasabi: Since yeah, it's not always viewport relative.
23:13 @ajpiano: OMG I WROTE NOE
23:13  JKarsrud: wasabi: Position the container relative then?
23:13  Lumpio-: inoerite
23:14  wasabi: Well, I don't want the script to care about the container. =/
23:15  wasabi: Maybe my second elements hould be injected at the document level instead.

23:15  serio: var container_margin = $( '.container' ).css( 'margin-left' ).replace( 'px', '' );
23:15  wasabi: position: absolute-viewport would be nice here. heh
23:16  serio: is there a cleaner way to get the value without px?
23:16 @ajpiano: serio parseInt()

23:25  SJr: Can you have more than one jQuery animation executing at one time?
23:25  WinegumS: anyone found my problem yet :? http://pastebin.com/jsUihATh
23:25  dabear: SJr: yes, using different queues
23:25  SJr: different queues?
23:26  dabear: SJr: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
23:26  dabear: set queue to false
23:27  SJr: Hmmmm so I'm kind of stuck with a problem dabear, and I can't seem to find where it is
23:28  SJr: basically I have an SWT Browser Widget that lets me execute javascript on the fly, and in it, I do some dom manipulation and some jQuery
23:28  SJr: it seems that if I keep calling execute, the animations don't complete.
23:28  SJr: One thought was that it would kill the animations previously running, but I can't seem to demonstrate that behavor without jQuery
23:28  dabear: ok, but gone, sry

23:30  xid: is there a way to override firefox's tendency to override attr('value') with the user-entered text?
23:30  xid: how do I get the actual string of the attribute? it works right in webkit
23:32  xid: i tried $(this).val($(this).attr('value'));
23:32  xid: but it just gets the text the user has already entered
23:32  xid: instead of what is contained in the markup
23:33  xid: even after reloading the page
23:33  gkatsev: um... isn't it just $(this).attr('myAttr')?
23:33  ||cw: xid: the markup just preloads the element.
23:33  xid: sure... i think i tried that too at some point
23:34  ||cw: if the user changes the value the DOM is changed
23:34  ||cw: val() reads the DOM
23:36  xid: right
23:36  xid: it's just irritating that moz stores the val after reload
23:37  xid: and webkit doesn't
23:37  skapism: if I use delegate(element, "change", function () {}, it only fires when the text input field loses focus
23:37  ||cw: so in moz attr('value') is different than val() ?
23:38  ||cw: that almost sounds like a bug
23:38  skapism: is there any way to define "change" when the value of the text input just changes?
23:38  xid: no...
23:38  xid: it's the same
23:38  xid: but I can't seem to revert to the original value from markup, even after reload
23:38  xid: guess i'll set a var
23:39  ||cw: oh!  yeah chrome is nice and preserves a users input
23:39  JKarsrud: Ahh, Fx is a bitch on that one
23:39  serio: anybody have any suggestions for making this a bit more DRY? http://jsfiddle.net/8AAfd/
23:39  serio: ajpiano, I'm looking at you!
23:39  ||cw: why are you reloading instead of resetting the form?
23:39  xid: well, i mean, if i load a new page, the values are retained.. maybe resetting the form on load is the solution
23:39  xid: how is that accomplished?
23:40  ||cw: .trigger('reset')
23:40  xid: thanks!

23:40  JKarsrud: serio: couldn't you make one slide function, that takes a param?
23:40  SJr: do methods like slideIn() get added to a queue or do they simply get executed concurrently?
23:42  sonoprontosonoqu: hi there. I need some help. I have a hierarchical tree, and i want a function that can find the next element (child, or if there is no child, the next it, and if there is no next item, the next parent ... and ... if none of those exist, then go to the root of the tree. I also need to work it the other way round (up). Is there any simple solution to this ?
23:42  JKarsrud: serio: And do a switch on the parameter, to edit an object to slide left or right if it's next or previous?
23:42  JKarsrud: Don't really have the time atm to really test it out, but it might work no?
23:42  serio: that's what I was doing initially, and it was fine, but I need like a min + max
23:43  serio: so that the thing doesn't slide off the page.
23:43  JKarsrud: You could still do that, you just pass in a different object?
23:43  ||cw: sonoprontosonoqu: .next() deosn't cut it?
23:43  serio: it's weird, I know I've written this before in a cleaner manor, I'll have to check the script when I get home.
23:43  sonoprontosonoqu: next only looks at the elements at the same level no ?
23:44 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
23:45  ||cw: sonoprontosonoqu: actually, $(this + ' + *') might work
23:45  JKarsrud: serio: Yeah, do that. Can't see what it should be a problem thoug
23:45  JKarsrud: though, even
23:45 @ajpiano: NO IT WON'T
23:45 @ajpiano: ?concatobj @ ||cw
23:45  bot-t: ||cw, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
23:46  NET||abuse: hmm, anyone know how to deal with tmpl and going 3 levels deep into an object to get the list to iterate over?
23:46  sonoprontosonoqu: llcw, don't know well the selectors, what does ' + *' stand for ?
23:46  ||cw: http://api.jquery.com/next-adjacent-Selector/
23:47  NET||abuse: my page is throwing undefined errors for this http://client2.test.featured.ie/     which loads this template..
23:47  ||cw: hm, maybe that won't go "up" either
23:48 @ajpiano: sonoprontosonoqu you just need to do a bunch of conditional assignments
23:48  RTPMatt: NET: that does work, you just have to play with it till you get it to work right, I don't have mouch more advice about that
23:48  sonoprontosonoqu: ajpiano, yep, but there must be a smart guy who thought of an elegant way of parsing trees like that ....
23:49 @ajpiano: you can be that guy
23:49 @ajpiano: find the next it
23:49 @ajpiano: !
23:49  NET||abuse: RTPMatt: huh? you have it working?

23:50  sonoprontosonoqu: thinking of maintaining an index
23:50  sonoprontosonoqu: the conditional set is quite complex (done it but it's ugly, and requires a recursive function)
23:50  NET||abuse: RTPMatt: my template looks like {{each deal.details.highlights}}  <li>${$value}</li> {{/each}}   anything wrong with that?
23:52 @ajpiano: sonoprontosonoqu, all the elements have some selector in common??
23:52 @ajpiano: you could definitely use an index based approch, it would probably be best in fact
23:53 @ajpiano: var elems = $("li.tree").click(function() {  var index = elems.index(this), next = elems.eq(index+1), prev = elems(index-1);    });
23:53  sonoprontosonoqu: right. does js / jquery allow inserting a value in an array at a given position in the middle of the array ?
23:53  serio: yes
23:55  sonoprontosonoqu: ajpiano: will jquery systematically populates the index in the order of appearance of the elements in the html code ?
23:56 @ajpiano: yes, jquery always returns elements in DOM order
23:56 @ajpiano: way to be verbose :)
23:56  sonoprontosonoqu: :)
23:57  serio: I wasn't able to decipher that one.
23:57  sonoprontosonoqu: easy
23:57  sonoprontosonoqu: (not verbose)
