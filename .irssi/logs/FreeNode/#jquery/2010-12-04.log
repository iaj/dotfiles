00:00  pallethm: anyone?
00:01  janthony: <input type="submit" value="Save List Order" class="button" name="submit"> <span class="mcd_cl_savedListNotification">Category List Order Has Been Saved</span> - when I have mcd_cl_savedListNotification load with .show(), it first appears under my submit button, then comes to the right of the submit button. Any idea why it just doesn't load to the right of the submit button and why it's starting to load underneath and moving to the right?
00:01  Ryro: pallethm:it can validate based on an ajax call, you could then validate if its a date based on that?
00:02  janthony: To further clarify, if i just do .show() it works fine, but if I do .show(3000) or any kind of animation/effect in the call back, it loads below the submit button at first then moves to the right of the submit button
00:02  eTiger13: serio:  yeah. i didnt like how the page would show scroll bars for the invisi stuff so thats why i manually set the width and height
00:03  janthony: any ideas?
00:04  eTiger13: ?p @ janthony

00:07  janthony: eTiger13: I pasted the excerpts. jsfiddle will not matter. half of this code is php and you will not be able to do anything with it in jsfiddle
00:08  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: did you include the plugin? and what is the specific error message?
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: i did
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: it's just css and jscript files
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: i included all of them
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: and copied the html over
00:08  eTiger13: janthony: yeah i know but i only support jsfiddle. makes it easier for me to change shit
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: into joomla
00:08  pApA_sMuRf: it works on a plain .html file -- but now that i copied over to a joomla template, the effects dont work
00:09  janthony: eTiger13: http://jsfiddle.net/dY3yk/1/
00:09  eTiger13: joomla is probably fucking with shit. it does that. especially when including js
00:10  pApA_sMuRf: eTiger13 -- what should i do then?
00:10  pApA_sMuRf: *trying to disable all other jscript files first*
00:11  eTiger13: janthony: wrap it in a div that is floated to the left or displayed inline. show() with options will display: block it making move before and then remove that when its done
00:11  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: live link would help me
00:13  pApA_sMuRf: eTiger13 - deving on localhost :/
00:13  janthony: eTiger13: Hrm, how do you display something inline that is displayed as none at the same time? i.e. so the div only appears when the animation happens? Or are you ferring to using the .wrap function add the inline div?
00:13  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: check firebug and see what gets loaded. is mootools getting loaded?
00:13  eTiger13: or multy jquerys?
00:13  pApA_sMuRf: hmm mootools is getting loaded
00:14  eTiger13: janthony: wrap it in a div that is floated or displayed inline, then in the show callback unwrap it. or not
00:14  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: thought so. that may be the problem
00:16  janthony: eTiger13: $(".mcd_cl_savedListNotification").wrap('<div class="mcd_cl_jquery_inline_div" />').show(2000);   .mcd_cl_jquery_inline_div { display: inline; }   - had the same problem
00:16 --- Gercek_ is now known as Gercek
00:17  pApA_sMuRf: eTiger13 -- i just renamed mootools.js to a different file name. it should work right?
00:18  eTiger13: janthony: start off with the element showing, and get it to work with that wrapped div with the css and then try adding the effect
00:18  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: thats a bad idea. joomla needs that crap for stuff
00:18  eTiger13: ?no conflict @ pApA_sMuRf
00:18  bot-t: pApA_sMuRf, jQuery.noConflict() - Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
00:19  serio: haha
00:19  serio: renaming the file will not put it in another namespace, and prevent object conflicts.
00:19  serio: sadly
00:20  eTiger13: it will prevent it from loading though, but will make the page take longer to load and breaks anything that depends on it
00:20  danheberden: sounds like a win win serio and eTiger13
00:20  serio: foken joomla
00:21  eTiger13: yeah i know
00:21  serio: somebody should make a CMS that isn't balls
00:21  eTiger13: im dealing with that mess now
00:21  serio: joomla's OK
00:21  eTiger13: serio:  you look at cmsms?
00:21  pApA_sMuRf: do i have to use jQuery.noConflict() with all the code in the js file for jquery? (that too in my <head> tag?)
00:21  eTiger13: joomla sucks. a loooooooot
00:21  serio: well, compared to what?
00:21  serio: drupal?
00:22  janthony: eTiger13: Ok, I got it to work with just .show() with the div wrapping around it. after I got it to work that way, I added 2000 inside the .show() and it's still doing the same thing. :/
00:22  itissid: jquery UI Devs: Please critique http://mnesia.wikispaces.com/Mulling+widgets+API's
00:22  eTiger13: serio:  compared to itself. i hate using joomla. so complicated and unnecessary. about on par with drupal
00:23  eTiger13: janthony: sorry, i should have said to have the inner div set to display block
00:23  pApA_sMuRf: eTiger13 what cms do you use then?
00:23  serio: from a user standpoint it's at least a little better.
00:23  eTiger13: janthony: you cant just have it always be on the line underneath?
00:23  serio: the backend is somewhat meaningful
00:23  eTiger13: pApA_sMuRf: cms made simple is decent. doesnt look as pretty but its a lot simpler and more straight forward
00:23  janthony: eTiger13: I can, but it looks ugly. :/
00:24  pApA_sMuRf: isn't it possible to link jQuery.noConflict() to a "src" file
00:24  ajpiano: itissid: you make some intersting points, esp re: event delegation ,etc
00:24  ajpiano: itissid, but also, i think there's some stuff about the widget factory that you don't get
00:25  serio: I like this website
00:25  serio: it reminds me of water
00:25  serio: and mountains!
00:25  itissid: ajpiano, What about widget factories?
00:25  ajpiano: you don't know what the jquery ui widget factory is?
00:25  ajpiano: but you wrote an entire post complaining about the architecture of jquery ui
00:25  ajpiano: ?
00:26  janthony: Any other ways or ideas to get around it? Try float left instead of display: inline I guess?
00:26  itissid: I do but what about it do you think I dont get

13:01  PY1NB: ahhhh I see... thanks!
13:02  claudio: PY1NB, but I think you're trying to *hide* the elements, not remove them
13:02  PY1NB: actually I defined classes for my form elements then accessing them by their classes.. not nice, but works.

13:36  jann: Hi there.  I've got an issue: On a website i load a bunch of content into div`s that have display:none. Than when i click a specific link jquery grabs the content of one div and puts it into a visible container. For whatever reason it sometimes works fine and sometimes jquery just puts nothing into the visible div
13:38  sacho: well, what are the possibilities of this happening?
13:39  sacho: 1) check if you have actually correctly selected the div
13:39  sacho: 2) check if there's actually contents in the div

13:47  jann: Thanks, but it has to have been something different, because i fixxed the issue by loading the contents from the divs into javascript vars on pageload. Annother thing is, that this livesearch seems to get blocked by some adblockers http://jsfiddle.net/Qz65L/ any idea why?

16:07  l4rk: blez`: just because something works fine doesn't mean its not experimental
16:07  blez`: why it's experimental?
16:08  Rut69: but the actual anchor is id_{PRODUCT_ID}
16:08  Rut69: to stop the auto scroll
16:08 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
16:09  l4rk: blez`: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/momentum-scrolling
16:09  l4rk: whats the first line say in that?
16:09 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
16:09  blez`: so what's the big deal
16:11  l4rk: blez`: well its not official supported
16:11  l4rk: your mileage may vary
16:11  l4rk: i'm looking at the source, chances are good that body isn't supported
16:11  l4rk: thats what the big deal is
16:11  l4rk: you can't just take random code and change the intent and expect it to work
16:12  blez`: can I somehow put all from body into a container?

16:44  dub54: i want to loop a json object and call a function for each item, but dont want to execute the function until the previous is complete)
16:44  dub54: the function I call makes ajax requests
16:45  SugaSlide: o ok
16:45  SugaSlide: so you doing an ajax request on each record?
16:45  SugaSlide: isnt that excessive?
16:46  SugaSlide: cant you loop through all the items.. then do 1 ajax call
16:47  dub54: usually 10 or less records
16:47  dub54: but no, for what I'm doing I need to seperate requests
16:47  dub54: someone linked to http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-message-queuing/docs/files/jquery-ba-jqmq-js.html earlier which looks similar to what I want but I can't get it working, spent all day on this yesterday as well - just wanna get this sorted
16:47  SugaSlide: lol
16:48  SugaSlide: dub54 what about something like...
16:48  Rut69: ahh ok
16:49  SugaSlide: call your json thing
16:49  Rut69: $('body').scrollTo('#id_'+ id, {easing:'elasout'});
16:49  Rut69: is the animation incorrect?
16:49  SugaSlide: then wrap an ajax call in a function
16:49  SugaSlide: in the "success" of the ajax.. call the function again
16:49  SugaSlide: var i = 0
16:49  SugaSlide: then inside the function.. i++;

16:52  dub54: the only way I think is to either get the queue working or change how the script works (but I'd rather do the first)

18:43  j0hng4lt: Vindice: What you're looking at is not the source code, but rather, the DOM
18:44  j0hng4lt: Vindice: Most browsers will capitalize element names if you're in tag-soup mode (not pure XHTML).
18:45  Vindice: j0hng4lt: thanks for getting back to me. The problem isn't with capitalized element names, it's with the insertion of jQuery12914.... into the tag
18:45  j0hng4lt: Vindice: That's a non-issue... It doesn't actually insert it into the tag. It attaches a property to the DOM object
18:46  j0hng4lt: Vindice: For instance, if you were to say var e = document.getElementById('my-element-id'); e.foo = 'bar';
18:46  j0hng4lt: Vindice: you would see foo="bar" in the dom inspector

18:58  BrandonE: Hey. What's the easiest way to include the source of a local file in a textbox on the client side? I tried .load(), but it formats incorrectly in IE, and it won't load locally, giving the following error: Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
18:59  BrandonE: when I say locally, I mean, it works when it's on a server, but if I'm running it on my computer, no dice
19:00  ajpiano: you can't do like, shit
19:00  ajpiano: if you're using the file:/// prototocol
19:00  ajpiano: why don't you use a local webserver
19:01  j0hng4lt: I'm wondering why I haven't seen a lot of third-party jQuery-UI widgets. Is it because jQuery-UI is relatively new or is it because developers tend to dislike the library's object orientation?
19:01  glen1: if my url is index.php, how can jquery detect if I use index.php#more. So that I can include more things
19:01  j0hng4lt: Don't get me wrong... There are tons of widgets out there... It's just that they aren't extending jQuery-UI
19:01  ajpiano: j0hng4lt, not enough evangelism about how to use the widget factory, which is a problem i'm aiming ot correct

19:02  glen1: ajpiano, those slides are badass
19:02  glen1: and its exactly what im looking for, since you got #slide 16, how does jquery change the state of the page
19:04  BrandonE: ajpiano: I don't follow...
19:04  ajpiano: BrandonE, are you just going to like file:///C:/mywebsite/foo/index.html, and trying to do ajax
19:05  ajpiano: or do you actually have  local webserver on you machine, running apache or nginx or whatever
19:05  BrandonE: ajpiano: not running a webserver, no. I didn't realize that was a requirement necessary to load a local file
19:05 --- test__ is now known as Mike
19:06  ajpiano: BrandonE: file access, stuff like AJAX etc, just doesn't work when flies aren't being hosted on an actual webserver
19:06 --- Mike is now known as Guest11041
19:07  glen1: ajpiano in those slides how did you get it to change state when the url is #slide16
19:07  glen1: or any slide for that matter
19:07  ajpiano: hm?
19:07  BrandonE: ajpiano: OK, if that's the case, then I'll just accept that. That said, can we look at the other issue? IE is formatting the text horrendously, and I thought it was just because I was using \n instead of \r\n in said files, but after switching that, the same problem persists. Who would have known IE would mess things up?
19:07  ajpiano: you mean, how does it handle the hash stuff?
19:08  ajpiano: or are you talking about slide15,
19:08  j0hng4lt: BrandonE: Typically, anything beyond plain html documentation needs a Web server. Most IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) will fire up a local Web server if you create a single html page and click on the "View in Browser" icon
19:08  ajpiano: the one with the actual widget
19:08  glen1: ajpiano, how it handles hash stuff
19:08  glen1: I just picked slider16 because that was the one I was on haha
19:09  Trisox: back
19:09  Trisox: evening ajpiano
19:09  BrandonE: j0hng4lt: Well, I know most javascript works without a server, so I figured something like this would too
19:11  glen1: ajpiano, atm Im using php for that, eg  index.php and index.php?more (using an if statement)
19:11  ajpiano: glen1, hmm?
19:11  glen1: you know the hash stuff, on your slides?
19:12  ajpiano: BrandonE, that's cause most of the time js doesn't involve file operations or http requests
19:12  ajpiano: glen1, yeah
19:12  ajpiano: it parses the url hash and uses it to save the "current" slide
19:12  glen1: I want to do the same thing, do you use a plugin for that. So when the url contains #more, I will show a div and hide some divs
19:12  jhl: Is there anything syntactically wrong with this snippet?: http://dpaste.org/JCt0/
19:13  BrandonE: ajpiano: Understood. Any thoughts on my other problem?
19:13  ajpiano: i didn't write these slides, they're the ones from http://slides.html5rocks.com/#slide1
19:13  glen1: I dont care about the slides themselves just the method used in the url
19:13  ajpiano: glen1, thery're not jquery slide, no plugin for that
19:13  ajpiano: glen1, you know you could go look at the code right
19:13  glen1: when you change #hash you can use jquery to detect it
19:14  glen1: I am its huge
19:14  ajpiano: type in the word "hash"
19:15  ajpiano: glen1, it's not ever listening for hash changes
19:15  ajpiano: it's taking the initial hash, if passed, and using it to set the state
19:15  glen1: oh, is there a way to listen for the hash in a url
19:15  ajpiano: and on every slide change, it rewrites the hash
19:15  glen1: I just used the slides for example as you linked to them
19:15  ajpiano: glen1, have you seen see ?bbq
19:15  bot-t: glen1, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
19:16  glen1: who is this ben alman, I always get linked to his site haha
19:16  ajpiano: lol
19:16  ajpiano: he's ben
19:16  ajpiano: he hangs in here, and is also one of my colleagues now
19:17  glen1: he knows his jquery lol
19:17  ajpiano: he writes a lot of really well done jquery plugins
19:18  ajpiano: heh yes
19:18  glen1: Is he your go to guy when you are stuck haha
19:18  ajpiano: what?
19:18  ajpiano: no
19:19  ajpiano: i'm his go to guy for copy editing
19:19  ajpiano: lol
19:19  BrandonE: ajpiano: Perhaps I should just link to my file (http://brandonevans.org/hanoi/). Run this in anything but IE and check Source and it'll show a properly formatted file. Do it in IE and essentially all the line breaks are gone.
19:19  glen1: haha
19:19  ajpiano: BrandonE, oh right, i forgot to say, i don't have any idea what's going on
19:19  glen1: just curious are you all on macs?
19:20  ajpiano: glen1, i use mac and pc simultaneously
19:20  glen1: neo is that you
19:20  ajpiano: some people are on macs, some on windows, some linux
19:21  Vindice: j0hng4lt: Thanks for putting me straight earlier. Fixed the issues now I'm not fixating on a red herring. Cheers
19:22  ajpiano: BrandonE, wait, is your question, why does your "view-source" look different in IE?
19:23  BrandonE: ajpiano: No. Check the checkbox that says "Source"
19:23  ajpiano: oh
19:25  ajpiano: where is the code that like, controls this
19:26  ajpiano: ugh
19:26  ajpiano: BrandonE
19:26  Trisox: pff stupid php
19:26  ajpiano: don't do .load() into a textarea
19:26  Brodingo: holler
19:26  BrandonE: ajpiano: What should I do instead?
19:27  ajpiano: BrandonE, try doing a standard $.get of the content and then do $("#yourtextarea").val(data);
19:27  ajpiano: see if that works any better
19:27  paul_irish: hey
19:27  ajpiano: cause you're supposed to set textareas w/ val
19:27  ajpiano: sup paul
19:28  danheberden: howdy paul
19:28  Trisox: hey paul
19:28  glen1: ajpiano, I wondered why jquery bbq's examples were pictures of bbqs, then I caught on lol
19:28  ajpiano: lol
19:28  glen1: seeing the steaks makes me hungry
19:29  danheberden: hmph, i wish colloquy would perform the action on the room you clicked on and NOT the one that's just selected
19:29  ajpiano: you can blame me and paul_irish for the fact taht it has that name
19:29  Rufus: Greetings. I'm using autocomplete from jqueryui. How can I formce Enter key to submit a form if item from suggestion list is highlighted?
19:29  paul_irish: genius name.
19:30  glen1: why bbq? lol
19:30  ajpiano: "Back Button and Query"
19:30  glen1: I would have called it the hashmacine :P
19:30  paul_irish: back button query soemthingsomething
19:30  glen1: hashmachine*
19:30  paul_irish: THE HASHMACHINE
19:30  paul_irish: not bad.
19:30  glen1: buy the domain quick lol
19:30  vladikoff: hashmachine 9000
19:31  Trisox: the fun thing is if usefull people will use it no mather the name even if its called the fartexpress
19:31  sean`: anything looks cool when yo uadd 9000 to it
19:31  mino: hi everybody , i want make $.post() but synchronizd, script continu only when $.post is finish, its possible ?
19:32  Trisox: hey sean
19:32  ajpiano: mino: you can use $.ajax with async:false
19:32  ajpiano: but you shouldn't
19:34  mino: ajpiano: ok thx  :)
19:34  danheberden: ....ever
19:35  glen1: ajpiano, bbq is hella easy to use, i got this thing working just using your friend ben's code haha

19:37  keres: hi guys and girls, is there a way to select a child element, no matter what it is?
19:38  keres: like $('.container>child') so that it would select the child, regardless of it was an img or span
19:38  glen1: use the jquery michael jackson selector in v1.8
19:38  keres: haha
19:38  glen1: joke, I dont have a clue :)
19:38  glen1: if I had a framework I would name things like that lol
19:39  paul_irish: $('.container').children()
19:40  paul_irish: $('.container > * ')  is also an option but not a great one
19:40  keres: Nice :) thank you
19:48  JuJuBee: I am learning ajax and have my form elements via http://pastie.org/1347666  how do I build a query string for the ajax request?  Figured I could use a loop to build it?
19:50  glen1: wow I didnt know the jquery-ui filesize was huge
19:51  JuJuBee: or is jquery ajax submission really as simple as http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ ?
19:52  glen1: does it matter if the jquery document ready function is in the <head> tag or before the</body> tag
19:52  Brodingo: so guise
19:53  Brodingo: guys
19:53  Brodingo: guise
19:53  glen1: HEY BRO
19:53  Brodingo: sup
19:54  Brodingo: how to be animating scrolling the easiest?
19:54  Brodingo: scrollTo?
19:55  temp01: get a mouse
19:55  pApA_sMuRf: i'm using joomla which uses mootools and i'm loading jquery and so am having problems with the no.conflict script/function -- can i pm someone with a live link so that he/she can check?
19:56  glen1: temp01, EPIC WIN
19:57  ajpiano: JuJuBee: yes, ajaxForm can take a lot of the "legwork" out of like, ajaxifying existing forms
19:57  JuJuBee: ajpiano: does that form in the link do a page refresh?
19:58  ajpiano: no, that wouldn't make much sense would it
19:58  pApA_sMuRf: anyone?

19:58  JuJuBee: I would think not.  So something in the form.js fires a preventDefault() ?
19:58  ajpiano: Superman_: wtf
19:58  Superman_: sorry ajpiano
19:58  temp01: ?serialize @ JuJuBee
19:58  bot-t: JuJuBee, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
19:59  Superman_: really sorry I wasn't thinking to do that
19:59  ajpiano: JuJuBee: the way it works is like this... all the actual submission and ajax and stuff is taken care of by $.fn.ajaxSubmit
19:59  ajpiano: JuJuBee: and $.fn.ajaxForm is just a light wrapper that yes, binds submit to the ajaxSubmit and cancels the default
19:59  JuJuBee: ok.
19:59  JuJuBee: Thanks for that description
20:00  Superman_: ajpiano I want to see the code of the slider which is at the bottom of the page. But the way in which js files are included isn't understandable for me.
20:00  Superman_: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Bella-Sicilia-Identity/245814
20:01  keres: paul_irish, is there an easy way  to tell what object was selected? (e.g. if it was an img or object)
20:01  paul_irish: ?is @ keres
20:01  bot-t: keres, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
20:01  pApA_sMuRf: paul_irish can i pm you a link to check?
20:01  keres: Sweet :)
20:01  keres: thanks!
20:02  paul_irish: or... .attr('nodeName')
20:02  paul_irish: pApA_sMuRf: nah bro
20:02  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf: no one wants you to pm the link
20:02  ajpiano: you can paste your link in the channel
20:03  ajpiano: no one wants to steal ideas from half baked, not working javascript sites
20:03  ajpiano: i promise
20:03  pApA_sMuRf: lol
20:03  pApA_sMuRf: http://joomla.free3dmodelcars.info/
20:03  pApA_sMuRf: jquery isn't loading
20:03  pApA_sMuRf: or isn't working
20:03  pApA_sMuRf: cause it's using $ fucntion
20:04  ajpiano: Superman_: they obviously have some server side stuff going on for concatenating and caching their javascript
20:04  pApA_sMuRf: so i added no conflict on the top of the site in <head> but i think it's wrong
20:04  ajpiano: what is the issue
20:04  pApA_sMuRf: the effects are not working
20:04  pApA_sMuRf: on the jqeuery form
20:04  Superman_: I need to learn the best code practices and especially want to learn the slider
20:04  Superman_: code
20:05  ajpiano: Superman_ cool story bro
20:05  Superman_: which is at the bottom of the page
20:05  Superman_: dynamic content is coming in
20:05  pApA_sMuRf: http://s3.envato.com/files/311061/index.html -- it should be workign like this
20:05  JuJuBee: ajpiano: so if I wanted to use the form plugin like that, how do I submit the form and then add the results to a div on the page assuming the php file would return the new info to display  in the div?
20:05  Superman_: and how they are getting the width of all thumbs
20:05  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf, don't include jquery before your CSS...don't include jquery in the head at all, don't use jquery 1.4.1, use jquery 1.4.4
20:06  ajpiano: Superman_, no one is going to sit here and like, pick apart the code for you in some sort of learning exercise
20:06  ajpiano: if you want to figure out how a site works, you have to do that on your own
20:06  ajpiano: you don't just bring any random website in here and we breakdown the code for you
20:06  ajpiano: JuJuBee: like what?
20:06  Superman_: O_o I know ajpiano but atleast can tell me the way how they are getting the width of all the content in it
20:07  Superman_: in the slider
20:07  ajpiano: Superman_, no
20:07  ajpiano: ?sbahv @ Superman_

20:07  JuJuBee: ajpiano: I have a list of classes for a teacher and a "new class" form.  I want to submit the new class and then add it to the list.
20:07  ajpiano: JuJuBee, ajaxForm has a "target" option that lets you tell it where you want the ajax response to go, is that what you want
20:07  pApA_sMuRf: ajpiano -- i've read that if you're using mootools, you have to include jquery in the head above mootools
20:07  pApA_sMuRf: so if not in the head, where do i place it?
20:07  pApA_sMuRf: in the body?
20:08  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf, fine
20:08  JuJuBee: ajpiano: not sure, is the response from the php file? like an echo/print?
20:08  ajpiano: that's not really a good practise
20:08  ajpiano: JuJuBee,yes?
20:08  ajpiano: yes.
20:08  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf, you sould be loading scripts at the bottom of the bottom
20:08  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf, that's fine though, if you need to include it before mootools, do that
20:08  JuJuBee: OK, let me take a look at ajaxForm then
20:08  pApA_sMuRf: ajpiano - so now i move all scripts to the bottom?
20:08  JuJuBee: thanks
20:09  ajpiano: but put it BEFORE mootools, AFTER the CSS
20:09  pApA_sMuRf: well i just moved the css above the scripts
20:09  pApA_sMuRf: ^^
20:10  jhl: ajpiano: Is the Yahoo best practices doc the de facto standard for optimization, or are there other ones that are good as well?
20:10  JuJuBee: ajpiano: what should I read on to learn more about this?
20:10  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf: congratulations you have described the same thing
20:11  ajpiano: jhl: i think so but obviously there's like, zoompf.com and other stuff on perf
20:11  ajpiano: JuJuBee: about what, ajax??
20:11  pApA_sMuRf: ajpiano - i did that, not working
20:11  JuJuBee: the ajaxForm stuff

20:12  ajpiano: JuJuBee: the ajaxform website is probably the best place
20:12  JuJuBee: thanks
20:12  ajpiano: pApA_sMuRf: , no you didn't
20:12  ajpiano: you STILL have jquery before CSS
20:13  ajpiano: not that that should affect why your no conflict isn't working
20:14  pApA_sMuRf: no... i don't
20:14  pApA_sMuRf: the jquery related css is above the jquery scripts
20:14  pApA_sMuRf: unless you meant, all the css?
20:14  ajpiano: that's not how it works bro
20:14  ajpiano: that is, in fact, what i meant
20:14  pApA_sMuRf: ok moving all css on top
20:14  wunderkin: ajpiano: what was the perf you were referring to?
20:16  ajpiano: what ?
20:16  ajpiano: what was what perf
20:16  ajpiano: the general concept of performance
20:17  ajpiano: there is more about it than just yahoo
20:17  wunderkin: ah ya
20:17  wunderkin: of course ;D
20:18  pApA_sMuRf: ajpiano - did that, same result
20:19  ajpiano: [14:13 ] <ajpiano> not that that should affect why your no conflict isn't working
20:19  pApA_sMuRf: :/ bummer
20:20  pApA_sMuRf: alli have is this <script>jQuery.noConflict();</script>
20:20  ajpiano: yeah, and now debuggin skills
20:21  pApA_sMuRf: funny thing is that the slider aint working also
20:21  pApA_sMuRf: before it was

21:58  bot-t: p3lim, indexOf - Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
21:58  serio_: I'm well, was looking for some help to optimize a little plugin I wrote.
21:58  sean`: cool
21:58  serio_: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/uGFnf/
21:59  serio_: not sure if this line is all that kosher:
21:59  serio_: c = (i == _parent.length - 1) ? callback : null;
21:59  serio_: like, is passing null to .animate() a bad idea?
22:01  sean`: serio_, should make arguments optional
22:01  serio_: how would I go about doing that?
22:06  sean`: also serio_, you can't do it like this, and manually calculaet the delay
22:06  sean`: uhm, first: if ($.isFunction (easing)) { callback = easing; }
22:06  sean`: stuff like taht
22:07  sean`: second, if you manually calculate the delay, there is a chance they will run at the asme time
22:07  sean`: you need to create a recusive function that calls itself, and sets the pointer to ++
22:07  serio_: I don't think I'll end up calling it 'delay' in the end
22:07  sean`: I'ts not the word, it's the use of it
22:07  sean`: shouldn't be using .delay ()
22:07  serio_: what's wrong with the way it's used?
22:08  sean`: like I said
22:08  sean`: theres a possibility they will run simultaniously
22:08  serio_: I don't see how?
22:09  serio_: if they're being factored by i, the delay will always increment.
22:09  serio_: I mean, the end result isn't really in milleseconds
22:10  sean`: yeah
22:11  sean`: Do you know why people say use setTimeout and not setInterval?
22:11  sean`: because if anything happens in the mean while, it's possible that the next run in line will run
22:12  sean`: also, async doesn't mean, it's totally async
22:12  sean`: all async funcftinos are also executed in a straight line
22:12  serio_: I'm not using setInterval here though
22:12  sean`: no, but you're using it's logic
22:13  serio_: I'm open to further suggestions.
22:13  serio_: it was more or less an idea that I wanted to bounce of people.
22:13  serio_: *off*
22:16  sean`: serio_, http://jsfiddle.net/NkBEr/
22:16  sean`: also, this is me just being very strict, in real life your choice is not bad at all
22:20  serio_: no, I realize.
22:20  serio_: everyone says setInterval is awful, but in some instances it's not so bad.
22:20  paul_irish: AWFUL
22:21  serio_: oh shit, it's the javascript police!
22:21 * serio_ runs away
22:21  paul_irish: sean`: animation is the only case i can think of where setinterval is ok
22:22  paul_irish: or like.. something happening every 20+ seconds
22:22  serio_: paul, did you check that script?
22:22  paul_irish: $.fn.sequence?
22:22  serio_: yeah
22:22  serio_: has anibody written anything like this before?
22:22  serio_: *anybody*
22:22  paul_irish: you like leaking to global scope, bro?
22:22  serio_: lawl
22:23  serio_: I'm looking for ways to clean this up.
22:23  paul_irish: <3
22:23  serio_: that's kinda why I'm here
22:23  serio_: bro :D
22:23  kamo: LOL
22:23  kamo: oops
22:23  paul_irish: you got some odd code formatting practices.
22:23  paul_irish: accidental lahls.
22:24  DukeDrake: I use setInterval for slideshow ... wokrs great
22:24  sean`: oh yeah, serio_ add var to your variables :p
22:24  sean`: keep 'em local bro
22:24  serio_: my approach is entirely functional
22:26  serio_: yeah, that I can do.
22:27  alcuadrado: has anybody seen the new grooveshark power by jquery? =) it's pretty cool
22:28  paul_irish: its awes
22:28  serio_: awes vs awesome?
22:28  paul_irish: awes is less typing. same amount of awesome.
22:28  alcuadrado: I think they still using flash for playing audio (even in modern browsers), but it is a HUGE progress (:
22:28  paul_irish: imho
22:29  paul_irish: alcuadrado: i heard someone without flash said it still worked
22:29  alcuadrado: cool!
22:29  alcuadrado: that's a pretty good service, and their former UI was sooo slow
22:30  serio_: I still have no idea how they avoid litegation.
22:30  serio_: *litigation*
22:30  Ziggy`: Can anyone help me a bit, I'm trying to make the div appear in he right place inside the wrapper, depending on how large it is, but still below the li you hover over:
22:30  Ziggy`: http://pastie.org/private/lqtoff9x4hj1l34dml4wa
22:31  alcuadrado: litigation for...? i don't get you serio_
22:32  paul_irish: serio_: so
22:32  paul_irish: animate() queues by default
22:32  paul_irish: oic
22:33  paul_irish: i see what it does... shoulda hit Run
22:33  serio_: haha
22:33  paul_irish: yeah. this is delightful.
22:33  paul_irish: <3z
22:34  serio_: I thought it was a interesting concept, but I need a way to expand on it
22:34  serio_: and optimize this code
22:34  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, are you just trying to do a dropdown menu?
22:36  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: Similar to a dropdown menu, but simpler, since it's gonna show up just a div like that on hover.
22:36  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: But it needs to position it correctly inside the wrapper, depending on how large it is.
22:36  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: That's where I'm stuck.
22:36  serio_: paul_irish, was the delightful comment about my $.fn?
22:42  paul_irish: serio_: yes it was
22:42  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, why do you change the width of the elements? let the browser give it a correct size by itself
22:43  serio_: any suggestions for improvements? aside from the global scope?  I threw 'var' infront of _parent and c
22:43  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: I can do that as well, it's just to see the functionality of trying to positioning it depending on width.
22:44  alcuadrado: how should it be positioned?
22:44  serio_: ?source animate
22:44  bot-t: Line#6391 - "animate: function( prop, speed, easing, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6391
22:44  alcuadrado: serio_, this may help you understand why you should use "var": http://howtonode.org/object-graphs
22:45  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: When you hover over each element, it should position it inside the wrapper. and depending on width, underneath the element you hovered over.
22:45  alcuadrado: it works like that for me
22:45  alcuadrado: at least in chrome 8
22:45  LSshock: hi there, im trying to make a hover that changes the html of a link and i want it to change it back to the original text when i mouseout, anyone know how i could do this?
22:45  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: Hmm ?
22:45  paul_irish: serio_: the signature is kinda.. yucky
22:45  paul_irish: i mean.. its very animate()y
22:45  paul_irish: but
22:45  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: Can't be. it positions outside of the wrapper which is 960px.
22:45  paul_irish: i'd like an options object i think
22:47  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, look http://jsfiddle.net/3XGvD/1/
22:47  alcuadrado: it works for me
22:47  peter1: once i have selected an anchor $('a') how do i then replace the href value?
22:47  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: it works like that, but there's a reason why I put a diff width always, random width.
22:48  serio_: it's meant to animate()y
22:48  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: The reason is the .subCategories div can be of any size. depending from 100px to 700px.
22:48  LSshock: so using a mouseover to get the title= and show that as the html, want to reset the html to the original text on mouseout
22:48  serio_: I'm not entirely sure what you mean by signature.
22:49  alcuadrado: LSshock, you can use the data function, although that seems like a wired behaviour to me
22:49  alcuadrado: ?.data @ LSshock
22:49  bot-t: LSshock, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
22:50  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, and how should it be placed if it's too big?
22:51  paul_irish: sup k1ng
22:51  paul_irish: serio_: the API.  so many arguments
22:51  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: underneath the element but from the left if the element you hover over is all the way to the right, if its a element all the way to the left then from left to the right, if the element you hover over is to the middle, then try to position it to the middle of that element.
22:51  LSshock: i vaguely remember seeing this function bind to a Class/Id that had both the mouseover/out in one, i mean i can set the original html to a var and then later set it back
22:51  serio_: how would I tweak it to make options, well, optional?
22:51  k1ng: nm
22:52  k1ng: watching movie
22:52  k1ng: gtg
22:52  paul_irish: what movie
22:52  serio_: I'm watching T2:Judgement Day on Netflix
22:52  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, so you should make that comparissons and decide whether to place it from the right or the left
22:52  serio_: \m/
22:52  paul_irish: serio_: you should read animate()s source code
22:52  paul_irish: learn about argument shifting!
22:52  serio_: that's what I'm doing! :)
22:52  Ziggy`: alcuadrado: Yeah, that's what I need a bit help with :)
22:52  serio_: but honestly, this shit is over my head.
22:53  serio_: also, this thing is mad bulky.
22:53  paul_irish: if (! $.isPlainObject(options){   callback = options;
22:53  paul_irish: or something
22:53  paul_irish: iunno
22:54  paul_irish: just type chcking inside so you see what signature of your plugin was used
22:54  paul_irish: options or not
22:54  alcuadrado: Ziggy`, you need to compare the offset of the hovered li, the width of the wrapper, and the with of the subcategories to be shown, and test if li-x-offest + subcategories-width isn't bigger than wrapper-width, otherwise place it from the right
22:58  serio_: alright, enough learning, time for some street fighter 4
23:02  LSshock: can i make this work somehow ? http://jsfiddle.net/NYGXW/
23:02  LSshock: same the html to a var that would work in the mouseout
23:03  LSshock: *save
23:04  alcuadrado: try it and you'll see =)
23:05  LSshock: haha well i am and its not working beyond the mouseover
23:05  LSshock: titleStr not defined
23:06  alcuadrado: and have you considered what happens after many moseouvers?
23:06  alcuadrado: .live() calls are accumulative
23:07  LSshock: sadly im no expert just trying to get what i need somehow
23:09  alcuadrado: have you seen the .data function I told you?
23:09  alcuadrado: ?.data @ LSshock
23:09  bot-t: LSshock, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
23:09  LSshock: oh sorry you spoke kinda negative about it so i tried to find some other way
23:10  alcuadrado: you can store the string like that onmoseover, and get it back on mouseout
23:10  LSshock: great :)
23:10  alcuadrado: I wasn't negative about that function, it's great
23:10  LSshock: my bad :D
23:11  alcuadrado: I thought you where trying to change links text on mouseover, which seems odd :p
23:13  LSshock: i am
23:14  LSshock: the post title shows/changes into the post date on mouse hover and pack to post title on mouse out
23:14 --- JKarsrud1 is now known as JKarsrud_
23:16  alcuadrado: LSshock, IMHO that may confuse some users
23:16  alcuadrado: but depending on your audience it could be OK
23:17  LSshock: it saves space, and its for a creative blog so i believe it should be okay
23:17 --- MikhX_ is now known as MikhX
23:18  alcuadrado: so go for it =)
23:18  LSshock: :) thanks
23:18  cohitre: LSshock: do it with css
23:19  cohitre: have a .post-header section with your date and title
23:19  cohitre: and when you mouse over you toggle a class "display-date"
23:20  ultrarapid: i've made an image popup gallery. but once every now and then when i open it the window isn't at the middle of the window but a bit to the right or a bit to far down the bottom. this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/SXjBm/
23:20  LSshock: cohitre: how does that change the text?
23:20  LSshock: oh wait think i get what you mean
23:21  alcuadrado: I prefer the cohitre approach too
23:31  philipp: hi, is it possible to have more than one $(document).ready() on one site?
23:31  Cork[home]: yes
23:32  philipp: Is it trivial or do I have to do something special in this case?
23:32  alcuadrado: $(document).ready() calls are accumulative
23:32  Cork[home]: just use the callback multible times
23:33  philipp: cool, thx
23:33  RTPMatt: you can just add as many as you like
23:33  RTPMatt: they are execuceted in the order that are in on your page
23:34  philipp: nice!
23:36  ultrarapid: can anyone figure out why my modal-window once every 5-6th time i open it is not centered but of either to the right or to the bottom? http://jsfiddle.net/SXjBm/
23:37  RTPMatt: what browser are you using?
23:37  ultrarapid: chrome
23:38  RTPMatt: i have seen problems with that in chrome, not sue what waused it though
23:38  RTPMatt: which is a totally unhelpful statment, sorry
23:39  ultrarapid: it's the same in ie8
23:39  ultrarapid: and firefox
23:39  RTPMatt: well, then, i suppose it is probably something else
23:43  RTPMatt: ultrarapid: have you tried changing you positioning lines to fixed number and seeing if it comes up in the same place every time?
23:48  Rufus: Greetings. I'm using jquery UI autocomplete widget. How can I make it so if I click the search textbox that already has chars in it, to make the autosuggest list show ?
23:50 --- Rixius is now known as Rixius|Away
23:51  RTPMatt: Rufus: you could probably call the search event, which should make it sho: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#method-search
23:51  devinrolsen: Rufus, seems like $('input').click(function(){$(this).autocomplete( "search" , [value] )}); (not tested).
23:52  Rufus: Thank you both. I'll try in a few.
