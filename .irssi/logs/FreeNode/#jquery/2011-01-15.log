00:09  yumgusherscandy: hello, is it possible to make a form with jquery that can connect to a mysql db and do updates/deletes etc etc
00:09  yumgusherscandy: just using jquery that is
00:09  yumgusherscandy: I want to do it for a mobile app
00:12  parad0x: @yumgusherscandy something has to recieve the data and write to the db so technically, no.
00:13  parad0x: Plus I'm assuming you would want some type of auth so you probably wouldn't want to do it all client side even if you could.

01:13  Mnkras-Laptop: and im stumped with my basic jquery knowledge
01:14  Mnkras-Laptop: and i need to have it return true
01:15  clarkfischer: Mnkras-Laptop: console.log(this) will return undefined to your children selector

01:15  Mnkras-Laptop: yea,
01:15  bot-t: .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
01:15  Mnkras-Laptop: i learned tha
01:15  a_L_p_: Trisox: I am not sure how to just remove the text... remove removes the whole <a> element
01:15  Mnkras-Laptop: that*
01:16  Mnkras-Laptop: just didn't remove it
01:16  clarkfischer: What are you trying to accomplish here, Mnkras-Laptop?
01:16  Trisox: a_L_p_ explane again what you waned to do
01:16  clarkfischer: When you click on the titlebar, the contents of the div are shown?
01:16  Mnkras-Laptop: yea
01:16  Mnkras-Laptop: i have a bunch of divs that are exactly the same
01:16  Mnkras-Laptop: except for their ids

01:17  clarkfischer: .toggle()?
01:17  Mnkras-Laptop: cause I suck at jQuery :)
01:17  Mnkras-Laptop: lemme try that
01:18  Trisox: a_L_p_ like this ? http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
01:18  a_L_p_: trisox: yeah, I used that but how can I select just the text and hide that?
01:19  Trisox: in side the link?
01:19  a_L_p_: yes
01:20  Mnkras-Laptop: so $(this).siblings().toggle('.ccm-dashboard-inner')
01:20  Mnkras-Laptop: should show/hide that div
01:20  Mnkras-Laptop: when in a click function
01:20  Trisox: .text('')

01:21  Trisox: $('a').text('')

01:25  Trisox: i didnt make anything of your code :)
01:25  Trisox: yeas
01:25  Mnkras-Laptop: and it will toggle the the ccm-dashboard-inner area
01:25  Mnkras-Laptop: i have multiple blocks of the same html/php code
01:25  clarkfischer: Mnkras-Laptop: That's what the .siblings() is for.
01:25  clarkfischer: Don't put a selector in .toggle()
01:25  Mnkras-Laptop: ok,
01:26  Trisox: :D
01:26  Mnkras-Laptop: :P
01:26  Trisox: if you dont know what it is look at the api good info in there

01:33  libertiy: hi jquery experts i need some advice on jquery and countdown timers
01:34  libertiy: i want to create some jquery to show a timer countdown, a time x in the future and on time x i want to popup a message
01:34  libertiy: anyone can point me in right direction to achieve such a thing with jquery
01:34  beastman: how do i go about executing a function when a select box changes, whether manually or programmitcallyu
01:34  beastman: is there an on change event for a select box?
01:35  beastman: .. i mean drop down :/
01:35  clarkfischer: libertiy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
01:36  libertiy: thx clarkfischer do you might also know a good visual countdown jquery plugin
01:37  libertiy: somethine like a [==========] colored bar getting smaller each second
01:37  libertiy: from right to left it would get smaller untill zero
01:38  beastman: got it, that jquery documentation is godly
01:39  clarkfischer: libertiy: You'll have to setTimeout for 1s (1000ms), then update the element to reflect how much time is left
01:40  Mnkras-Laptop: finally got it,
01:40  clarkfischer: Also do a check to see if the time has expired, and trigger the popup message
01:40  Mnkras-Laptop: :P
01:40  Mnkras-Laptop: thanks,
01:40  Mnkras-Laptop: later,
01:40  clarkfischer: beastman: Yeah, checkboxes should fire a change. At least they do in chrome.
01:41  beastman: actually im dealing with a dropdown list, but it seems to work in chrome
01:41  clarkfischer: Oh
01:41  clarkfischer: beastman: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html#t01
01:41  beastman: i actually havent even thought about cross browser compatibility :/
01:42  clarkfischer: It looks like IE, Opera & Konqueror won't fire if the user changes it via the keyboard
01:42  clarkfischer: More specifically http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html#t05
01:44  beastman: bummer, doesnt look like i have many alternatives tho
01:44  beastman: maybe a blur but im going to need that change when the keyboard is sued
01:44  beastman: used*
01:45  clarkfischer: beastman: Ie, Opera & Konqueror make up a very small portion of the browser market.
01:45  clarkfischer: Well, not IE, but who cares about IE
01:45  beastman: i will have a disclaimer, done.
01:46  beastman: everybody should be using chrome
01:46  clarkfischer: beastman: Well, to elaborate, some browsers act differently. IE, K and Opera will fire 'change' 3 times if the user opens the select box, and uses the down arrow to highlight three different boxes.
01:46  clarkfischer: What's 'supposed' to happen is it's only supposed to be called when the user collapses the select box on a singular option.
01:47  beastman: ah well thats no issue, im only changing the contents of a div on chance
01:47  clarkfischer: So, in short, don't worry about it. At worst, you'll be getting too many 'change' events.
01:47  beastman: change*
01:48  clarkfischer: Better than getting none :)
01:48  beastman: haha very true
01:48  beastman: thanks for the insight
01:48  clarkfischer: You are very welcome.

02:02  take_it_t: when using ajax to get a data and insert it into the dom, how can i make sure that my event handling continues to work
02:03  clarkfischer: Why wouldn't it?
02:03  clarkfischer: Because of the DOM manipulation?
02:04  take_it_t: im not sure thats why im asking
02:04  take_it_t: i have an event handler binded to click events for a certain class
02:04  Lumpio-: If you use .bind and the element gets destroyed, the handlers are gone.
02:05  Lumpio-: You can use .live for event delegation
02:05  take_it_t: thats it
02:05  take_it_t: been a while since i had to do this
02:05  take_it_t: thanks!
02:06  clarkfischer: Yeah, .live() is what you're looking for.
02:14  take_it_t: hrmm still doesnt seem to be working, is there a certain way i should be inserting the content
02:14  someprimetime: where should i put my database insertion code for http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#default so that when i drop the object to the container, it'll insert a value into the db
02:15  someprimetime: i tried to put it in the .html (" Dropped!"); area but it wouldn't work there
02:15  someprimetime: i'm a pretty big noob at javascript/jquery in general
02:16 --- gf3` is now known as gf3
02:16  netking: when the event happens of you dropping the object, call a php file or such with $.post
02:17  someprimetime: nice thanks netking i'll play around with that
02:17  netking: look up $.post its pretty easy, gettin results back should be formed as xml or json
02:17  someprimetime: nice doin that now. thanks

02:34 --- danheberden is now known as danheberden|away
02:35  take_it_t: jaredhoyt: whys that? also still not luck, any chance it's because the delegate function is the one actually inserting the content
02:35  take_it_t: and that its going in some weird loop
02:36  jaredhoyt: take_it_t: why delegate() over live()? performance... smaller bind
02:36  jaredhoyt: live is on the document, delegate is bound to an element (unless you're doing $(document).delegate())
02:36  take_it_t: oh fair enough, yeah i narrowed it down to $('body').delegate()

03:02  Kuros: although if I paste the source from the result frame of that, it works...hmm. thanks!
03:04  ngharo: Kuros: you'll need to wrap the tabs command inside a $(document).ready()
03:04  ngharo: guessing that was your problem
03:05  Kuros: well...if I put this one: jqueryui/css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.8.custom.css

03:05  Kuros: then it stops working
03:06  petersendidit: Kuros: sounds like your custom version doesn't have the tab styles in it

03:53  mrlarner: hello, i'm trying to use $.get or .load() to pull in an html document. wondering if it's possible to select elements within the ajax response on complete, and it doesnt seem to work ( ie $(data).find('.someclass') )
03:56  richardwhiuk: mrlarner: try $('.someclass', data) instead
03:56  mrlarner: yeah i tried that too and didnt seem to work, but i'll try it again
03:57  jeff-h: mrlarner — your json response won't be a jquery object, likely just a string that looks like html, am i right?
03:57  mrlarner: it's not json, it's a string of html...wondering if maybe the mimetype is confusing jquery?
03:57  jeff-h: i'm far from good at this so others please laugh but I would try wrapping data in $() ie make it $.(data)
03:58  mrlarner: haha yeah i tried that too :(
03:58  jeff-h: rats :p
03:58  MaxMeents: how do you say $(this '.class') ?
03:58  jeff-h: MaxMeents — what are you trying to do?
03:58  MaxMeents: like this is a div and I want to select all divs attached to this
03:58  MaxMeents: all classes
03:58  mrlarner: if i do $('#someid').load('url #someotherel'), it will load and replace the content...but i need to do some extra stuff before it replaces
03:59  jeff-h: MaxMeents do you want a list of all the classes attached to a given div?
03:59  MaxMeents: rawr, yes
03:59  MaxMeents: sorry, no rawr
03:59  MaxMeents: lol
03:59  MaxMeents: I want a specific class
03:59  MaxMeents: attached to this

04:00  MaxMeents: OH!
04:00  MaxMeents: i see, I need ids

04:01  MaxMeents: wait, no, what I'm trying to do isn't possible

04:03  mrlarner: MaxMeents: maybe try selecting the a.font with $('.font', this).addClass...
04:04  MaxMeents: beautiful
04:04  jeff-h: wondering if someone can help me? I have a deeply nested variable like myVar[a][b][c] and I want to test if myVar['something']['somethingelse']['again'] is an object
04:04  apucacao: sorry, wrong channel
04:05  jeff-h: can it be done without testing every single part of the nesting individually?
04:05  MaxMeents: also, any suggestions on how to center text virtically?
04:06  MaxMeents: by the way, awesome solution
04:06  MaxMeents: virtical align is so weird
04:06  jeff-h: ie not if (typeof myVar['something'] == 'object' && typeof myVar['something'] ['somethingelse']== 'object' && typeof myVar['something']['somethingelse']['again'] == 'object')
04:06  mrlarner: depends on where your text is... if you can define the height of the parent and it's one line, set line-height to the parent height i believe
04:07  mrlarner: jeff-h: try iterating over the object properties recursively?
04:08  MaxMeents: your two tips have absolutely made my day, thank you mrlarner, peace out

04:25  mrlarner: +1
04:25  juque: grantgalitz: nop, a plugin
04:28  jeff-h: mrlarner, really, $(mything) should convert mything to an object
04:28  jeff-h: but I guess it depends what you mean by object
04:28  jeff-h: do you mean a jquery object?
04:28  mrlarner: thats what i mean :\
04:28  jeff-h: ie one that you can use jquery methods on
04:28  mrlarner: it seems as if i get one, its got a length and all...but i cant do $(data).find('#something')
04:28  jeff-h: yeah, really $(var) should do it
04:29  jeff-h: does .find exist as a method?
04:29  jeff-h: ie does js give you an error there, or do you just get no result

04:34  mrlarner: false
04:35  jeff-h: did you try $(data).find
04:35  jeff-h: (in the console?)
04:35  jeff-h: it should either say undefined or show you the code of that function
04:35  mrlarner: it seemed to not throw an error, but it didnt return any results, which i know are in the string
04:38  mrlarner: yeah $(data).find does exist
04:40  jeff-h: so if you do var data = '<div id="a">a</div><div id="b">b</div>';
04:40  jeff-h: then $(data).find('#a')

04:41  mrlarner: length 0 still....wonder what's up
04:41  jeff-h: sorry, that can't go straight in the console
04:41  jeff-h: try those two lines in the start of your js file, perhaps
04:41  grantgalitz: If I see another document.write or .innerHTML line again, I'll explode.
04:42  grantgalitz: DOM people, DOM
04:42  grantgalitz: Even IE6 can do it.
04:42  mrlarner: doom
04:43  jeff-h: grantgalitz — at risk of exposing my extreme ignorance, what should be used instead of .innerHTML?
04:43  jeff-h: mrlarner, sorry, the code should look more like: var data = '<div id="a">a</div><div id="b">b</div>';
04:44  jeff-h: var test = $(data).find('#a');
04:44  jeff-h: console.log(test);
04:44  jeff-h: and that fails for me too... which is interesting
04:44  mrlarner: jeff-h: oh snap....tried this in my success method: $data = $('<div id="dater">'+data+'</div>');
04:44  mrlarner: $data.find('#id') works now
04:44  jeff-h: no way
04:44  mrlarner: way
04:44  mrlarner: kind of annoying, seems hacky to me
04:45  grantgalitz: look up some basic dom bro
04:45  grantgalitz: createElement, appendElement, etc
04:45  brux: anyone ?
04:45  jeff-h: mrlarner what the? Makes my very simple test work too
04:45  mrlarner: .innerHTML is a dom property
04:45  mrlarner: by the way
04:46  grantgalitz: mrlarner: A bad one
04:46  mrlarner: as is document.write a method
04:46  grantgalitz: bad too
04:46  mrlarner: even ie6 can do it ;)
04:46  grantgalitz: Not supposed to be possible to use in an XML context (only in lossy HTML is it supposed to be valid)
04:46  jeff-h: mrlarner -- it smells like a mime type thing from your ajax until you see that the same problem exists even with my simple example
04:47  grantgalitz: mrlarner: It opens up the dom to bad coding, and is ugly.
04:47  mrlarner: i agree its ugly
04:47  jeff-h: i would dearly like to know what's wrong with my example
04:47  mrlarner: im just giving you a hard time
04:47  grantgalitz: Originally it's illegal in true XHTML
04:47  grantgalitz: application/xhtml+xml XHTML
04:47  grantgalitz: not the "I put the xhtml doctype so I think my page is xhtml now" crap
04:48  grantgalitz: but real XHTML
04:48  grantgalitz: As in your server sent the content type as application/xhtml+xml and not text/html
04:49  ngharo: don't look at the jquery source, you might explode ;)
04:52  mrlarner: jeff-h: not sure why your example wont work in the console
04:52  mrlarner: im about to give up, its the weekend and i got another site to push live, ugh
04:53  mrlarner: cant be the mime-type as it responds text/html, unless there's another mimetype it should be using?
04:53  jeff-h: i've asked a guy i work with — he's out at the moment though
04:54  jeff-h: can't be mimetime, i think, since in my example I'm just setting up an ordinary variable
04:54  jeff-h: is there some kind of code pastebin people use around here?
04:54  ngharo: mrlarner: append to the dom, then select
04:54  mrlarner: yeah, i just meant the ajax crap...not sure why i have to wrap it in a div
04:54  ngharo: oh nm im behind
04:55  mrlarner: dude earlier pasted with http://jsfiddle.net/
04:57  Aliv3: {"var1":"variable number 1","var2":"variable number 2"} to var1=variable%20number%201&var2=variable%20number%202
04:57  Aliv3: is there a function to do that?
04:58  mrlarner: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
04:58  someprimetime: with this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax how can i customize the css with my own stylesheet instead of having to edit stuff like .ui-state-hover, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-hover, .ui-widget-header .ui-state-hover, which is from the stylesheet on that page?
04:58  someprimetime: or does it need to be named like that

05:03  RobW: lol
05:04  addyosmani: so I'm writing a presentation at the moment and I've got a question about data.
05:04  addyosmani: paul says that $.data(‘#item’, key,value) is faster than $(‘#item’).data(key,value);
05:04  addyosmani: why is that?
05:05  mrlarner: addyosmani: good question, i hope someone knowledgable answers, as i've recently started exploiting that method
05:05  jeff-h: mrlarner and anyone else: finally got my code up at http://jsfiddle.net/HWD8x/
05:06  mrlarner: jeff-h: i wonder if that result is because the elements have no parent when you pass them through $()
05:06  mrlarner: i cant think of any other reason
05:07 --- Guest80287 is now known as ajpiano
05:07  ajpiano: sup broaz
05:08  ajpiano: addyosmani: there's just a lot of overhead associated with that because yor'e creating ajquery object and then doing the auto data- parsing stuff etc
05:08  ajpiano: anyhow, bed time
05:11  addyosmani: oooh.
05:11  addyosmani: thanks ajpiano
05:12  mrlarner: jeff-h: yo check it, works in console http://null.mrlarner.com/grabs/506d26c4.png
05:12  jeff-h: it's really strange
05:13  jeff-h: I think i have the answer
05:13  jeff-h: the jquery docs state .find finds the *descendants* of the matched object(s)
05:13  roel1234: /quit
05:13  jeff-h: the test1 case has no descendants that match #a
05:13  jeff-h: test2 does
05:14  mrlarner: aha!
05:14  jeff-h: apparently need to be weary of .find
05:14  jeff-h: i bet $('#a', data) would work though
05:14  jeff-h: but now i recall you said you tried that already
05:14  mrlarner: http://null.mrlarner.com/grabs/1d14e5b7.png
05:16  mrlarner: im guessing when you search for '#a' in the context of data, its finding children of data, which '#a' is not
05:16  jeff-h: http://jsfiddle.net/HWD8x/1/
05:16  jeff-h: yes — wow, that's a trap
05:16  someprimetime: any good implementation examples of the jquery ui tabs with graceful degradation?
05:16  jeff-h: mrlarner -- even more difficult to comprehend when you see the example i have put at http://jsfiddle.net/HWD8x/1/
05:17  someprimetime: i.e. the tabs are replaced with links rather than showing all the content stacked on itself
05:17  mrlarner: seems to make sense tho with our assumptions

09:19  Aple: I'm trying to make a div slide down as you scroll down the page. Anyone know of a plugin for that?
09:20  Aple: If not, can anyone point me to doc that would explain how to move the div relative to the viewport?
09:20  Aple: I'd really appreciate it.
09:21  oficina7: please, can someone explain to me what this example is showing? http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/default.html
09:23  Aple: Nevermind, found this: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-scroll-follow/wiki/Usage
09:23  ngharo: Aple: bind function to $(window).scroll() and use window.scrollY, screen.height, etc to absolutely position the element
09:24  ngharo: or that ;)
09:27  alcuadrado: oficina7: it shows a low level feature of jqueryui
09:27  alcuadrado: that set's relative positions dinamically
09:27  alcuadrado: by setting (and updating when needed) it's css
09:28  alcuadrado: nothing new, it's an utilitary function
09:29  oficina7: yeah but I can't understand it and I don't like that feeling :P
09:29  alcuadrado: imagine I have two independent divs
09:29  alcuadrado: and want to set one floating in the center of the other
09:29  oficina7: just one thing, are they nested?
09:29  alcuadrado: it's easy to do it with jquery, right?
09:30  oficina7: tags don't look nested for me
09:30  alcuadrado: no, they are independent
09:30  alcuadrado: but you can set it easily, with jquery.offset
09:30  alcuadrado: ?.offset
09:30  bot-t: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
09:30  alcuadrado: and with .css
09:30  alcuadrado: of something like that, right?
09:31  oficina7: oh ok, the imaginary nesting is set via position method
09:31  alcuadrado: or*
09:31  alcuadrado: yeah, someething like that
09:31  oficina7: so, what is that about?
09:32  alcuadrado: now, if the user drags the "parent", the child would still in it's place
09:32  alcuadrado: but if you use this jquery UI method that wont happen =)
09:32  alcuadrado: and it'll move with it's "imaginary parent", as if it was really nested
09:33  oficina7: oh now I get it
09:33  oficina7: I'd only understood the at/my part, now I get how the offset works
09:33  oficina7: pretty neat
09:33  oficina7: how does this colision thing works?
09:34  oficina7: I don't get that still
09:35  alcuadrado: nor do I
09:35  alcuadrado: I've never used that
09:35  alcuadrado: what I told you is what I could see :P
09:36  oficina7: LOL
09:36  alcuadrado: and it's weird that a "position" function does collition detection
09:38  oficina7: actually, I don't see the colision happening
09:38  oficina7: draggable has some collision stuff
09:39  oficina7: I gotta master jquery-ui today :P
09:39  pallet: anyone help me with pre loading images please http://pastebin.com/sK7sT3UM for the function in this paste
09:39  pallet: its the mouseove
09:39  pallet: r
09:39  pallet: that I need preloading
09:40  oficina7: pallet a simple way of doing preloading is create an another image on the screen
09:40  oficina7: but hiding it
09:41  pallet: LOL
09:41  pallet: really ?: )
09:41  pallet: ok, that's cool
09:41  oficina7: well, I'm just trying to make it simple
09:41  oficina7: you could do this....
09:42  oficina7: <img src="hover-image" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible" />
09:42  oficina7: this will make the browser invoke the url and cache the image
09:43  oficina7: but it won't show and will pop it out of the page, so some hide/show code you use won't get in conflict with that
09:43  pallet: the class your refering to there, do I need to define it ?
09:43  alcuadrado: oficina7, to see the collition detection in action move the parent to the border of the window
09:43  alcuadrado: BTW: what a nick, oficina7 :P
09:44  oficina7: lol it's portuguese
09:44  alcuadrado: it spanish it means office
09:44  oficina7: I'm willing to move to t2gs, what do you think?
09:45  oficina7: in portuguese, it's where you take your car to fix
09:45  alcuadrado: really? haha
09:45  oficina7: a carpenter's place of work too
09:45  alcuadrado: t2gs is better :P
09:45  oficina7: yeah, it's a common confustion when a Brazilian tries to understand spanish
09:45  oficina7: LOL
09:45  oficina7: does it look like it means anything to you?
09:46  oficina7: I haven't yet done a fonetical research
09:46  pallet: oficina7,  jQuery("body").append('<img src="'+psmainbutton_mo+'" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible" />');
09:46  alcuadrado: t2gs? no, but I know a really strange guy how makes people call him gs :P
09:47  oficina7: pallet stop trying to use javascript because you think it's cool, put it in the bottom of the html, or anywhere in the html and stop making ugly long javascript, that will make you happy
09:47  oficina7: ;)
09:47  oficina7: haha
09:47  oficina7: so it does look cool
09:47  oficina7: I'm waiting for a friend to come back from a trip
09:48  alcuadrado: pallet, here is a better sollution: http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript
09:48  oficina7: we're kinda seeing it we're gonna make a business together
09:48  pallet: oficina7, it's on a .js file
09:48  pallet: so it kinda has to be javascript
09:48  oficina7: pallet my oppion: code can't be long and readable.
09:49  alcuadrado: it's better not to touch the DOM for that
09:49  LearnerJq: can we programmatically determine content within an object?like say we have rules for the jquery validation library eg rules: { fielname: "required",fieldname2: "required"},so basically i want to loop through the fieldname array and use it inside the object like rules:{ for(){}}
09:50  alcuadrado: LearnerJq, take a look at the validity plugin
09:50  alcuadrado: ?validity
09:50  bot-t: alcuadrado, validity | jQuery Plugins - CheckValidity attempts to implement form validation using html5 markup. The aim to allow html5 forms that validate even in browsers that don't yet support html5. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/validity
09:50  alcuadrado: not that
09:50  alcuadrado: http://validity.thatscaptaintoyou.com/
09:51  oficina7: pallet but you could set yourself an array of URLs you want to preload, then loop thru it ['/img/a.jpg','http://google.com/cool.jpg','/img/c.jpg','/img/d.jpg'] loop thru it html += "<img src=':src' class='ui-helper-hidden-accessible'/>".replace(':src',src); $('body').append(html);
09:51  LearnerJq: ok but infact my forms are printed via php and it can have different fields ,therefore fieldnames are not known to me beforehand,
09:52  LearnerJq: and the fields actually are named as an array like input name="array[]"
09:52  oficina7: pallet though the real best way is to make a single stylesheetspread image file and use background-image/background-position
09:52  alcuadrado: you can loop the available inputs
09:53  alcuadrado: oficina7: it deppends on the semantic you are giving to the image
09:53  oficina7: of course
09:53  alcuadrado: if it's a dinamic image gallery, for example, you should use <img>
09:53  alcuadrado: and preload the images if needed
09:53  oficina7: I'm designing a new layout for our website, so I'm cracking my head on css now
09:53  oficina7: my personal fix for css2 selectors
09:53  oficina7: 	$("input[type='text']").addClass("input-text");
09:53  oficina7: 	$("input[type='submit']").addClass("input-submit");
09:53  oficina7: 	$("input[type='checkbox']").addClass("input-checkbox");
09:53  alcuadrado: :P
09:54  oficina7: jquery-ui rocks
09:54  oficina7: I never really looked at it from a css framework perspective
09:54  oficina7: lots of cool stuff
09:55  LearnerJq: alcuadrado: what is echo or print in php equivalent to in js?document.write? like in php i am using rules:{ echo  'fieldname:"required"'},how will i do it in js?inside the object?
09:55  oficina7: those classes and icons I never really took the time to get learned
09:55 * oficina7 has sucessfully converted 3 php programmers into rails
09:56  clarkfischer: LearnerJq: document.write typically empties the page and appends the content.
09:56  semaphore: still not into rails
09:56  semaphore: python/wsgi
09:57  LearnerJq: clarkfischer:so how gona we print something in js to be dealt as code to be run
09:57  clarkfischer: LearnerJq: You're probably looking to append a text node to the body. Something like $('body').append(text)
09:57  oficina7: semaphore I know python too, found it fast but didn't stop my heart though
09:57  clarkfischer: LearnerJq: Code to be run?
09:57  clarkfischer: I think you're talking about eval....don't talk about eval....
09:57  oficina7: LearnerJq tell us what you desire the most, from the bottom of your heart :P
09:59  LearnerJq: oficina 7:clarkfischer: i just want to write code which itself has to be evaluated adn then run...say i have 20 fields in a form,i dont want to write all the names by hand,i want all its names written thruogh js code so that jquery validation library handles it
09:59  clarkfischer: LearnerJq: That's  really bad idea....
09:59  clarkfischer: But if you really want to do it
10:00  clarkfischer: eval(code)
10:00  alcuadrado: noo
10:00  alcuadrado: don't tell him
10:00  alcuadrado: haha
10:00  clarkfischer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
10:00  alcuadrado: eval is evil LearnerJq, I advice you
10:00  alcuadrado: haha
10:00  LearnerJq: yes that is bad,but my requirement is not like this,infact i am developing a survey form whcih can have any number of input fields,and that is done via php and mysql,so i cant give manual names to fieldnames,all these questions have a particular database driven id,
10:00  clarkfischer: LearnerJq: You're probably going to want to create a more secure system rather than generating JS server-side and executing it arbitrarily
10:01  oficina7: LearnerJq go for Rails, I mean it
10:01  alcuadrado: why not do something like:   var inputNames = []; $("input").each(function () { inputNames.push($(this).attr("name")); });
10:01  clarkfischer: Why not have your server return a JSON object detailing the attributes for each fieldname, then have jQuery go through and draw the intended fields?
10:01  clarkfischer: Much much much much safer.
10:02  clarkfischer: If your server returns invalid code, it'll break the call stack and your script will die, too.
10:02  pallet: can you guys click on http://www.purchaseseal.com/sealdemo.html and check the tab and let me know if there's a delay on the Mouseover tab
10:02  alcuadrado: clarkfischer, but that won't work without js
10:02  LearnerJq: alcuadrado:exactly that is what i am doing,but then the inputNames array needs to be parsed thruogh inside the rules object?that is my question
10:03  LearnerJq: clarkfishcher:good point
10:03  alcuadrado: I didn't get you
10:03  clarkfischer: I'm not sure I understand.
10:04  clarkfischer: Can you show us some code?
10:04  LearnerJq: alcuadrado: i am showing u code,wait pz
10:04  alcuadrado: there is no deleay
10:04  pallet: cool
10:04  pallet: I'm done for now then ;)
10:04  alcuadrado: BTW: that HTML sucks :s
10:04  dr0id: WHERE IS THE FUN ? :O
10:05  alcuadrado: it may validate, mayybe. but it doesn't even have a head
10:06  alcuadrado: pallet: Why do you load javascript files like that?
10:06  oficina7: div id dr dir id dl
10:06  oficina7: <alcuadrado> BTW: that HTML sucks :s +1
10:07  clarkfischer: Where's this code?
10:07  oficina7: clarkfischer http://www.purchaseseal.com/sealdemo.html
10:07  oficina7: click on the right green tab
10:07  oficina7: then check the html inside the beautiful panel that fades in
10:08  clarkfischer: I think it's a test, dudes.
10:08  oficina7: it looks too pretty for a test
10:09  clarkfischer: I think he's testing the script that adds that little marker to the page.
10:09  LearnerJq: alcuadrado: see this please
10:09  LearnerJq: http://pastebin.com/fQqEM0FQ
10:09  oficina7: clarkfischer me too
10:10  alcuadrado: but LearnerJq, what are you using for validation?
10:10  clarkfischer: Uh....what?
10:10  oficina7: the inner html sucks, that's a BY THE WAY prepeding the sentence
10:11  clarkfischer: I have no clue what LearnerJq is trying to express...
10:11  LearnerJq: jquery validation library...i just took the rules snippet,dont worry about it,it just takes the names of the fields inside this rule object and tackles it,
10:11  pallet: oficina7, it is a test, I wrote it
10:11  BinaryKitten: LearnerJq the answer is no
10:11  BinaryKitten: but..
10:11  LearnerJq: clarkfischer:probably i am not able to elaborate my question well...
10:12  BinaryKitten: you can run through them, append to the object and pass that object to the rules
10:12  clarkfischer: So you want to add every input's id to the rules object as a key with the value 'required'?
10:12  BinaryKitten: that's what it seems to me
10:12  clarkfischer: $('input').each(function (i, item) { rules[item.id] = 'required'; })?
10:12  LearnerJq: clarkfisher:Exactly...
10:13  oficina7:  jQuery('#psw3563button').css('width','30px').css('height','150px').css('display','block').css('position','fixed') .css('top','50%').css('cursor','pointer').css(tabloc,'0px').css('background-image', 'url('+psmainbutton+')');
10:13  BinaryKitten: clarkfischer my thoughts exactly
10:13  BinaryKitten: oficina7 ewww
10:13  oficina7: jQuery('#psw3563button').addClass('nice-look')
10:13  BinaryKitten: pass an object
10:13  clarkfischer: too much chain.....
10:13  pallet: clarkfischer, oficina7 and alcuadrado I'm writing the tab for my product called PurchaseSeal which is launching on http://register.purchaseseal.com/
10:14  BinaryKitten: jQuery(id).css({property:value,property:value})....
10:14  LearnerJq: BinaryKitten:Clarkfischer:exactlyyyyyyy this is what i need...thanks a lottttttttttttt...infact i am more into php and u can easily use php inside html objects so i thought js will also be done this way...
10:14  BinaryKitten: LearnerJq you can do it with php as well
10:14  oficina7: pallet and you're breaking one of the basic html standards, have a single id="" for each tag
10:14  LearnerJq: i am doing it with php...but in js i couldnt
10:15  BinaryKitten: just build your items into an array on the php side and then use json_encode to output it
10:15  LearnerJq: hmmmmmmmmmm
10:15  oficina7: pallet you could use a table, there are many other tags dd, dl, ul, li, span.....
10:15  pallet: oficina7, where are you meaing ?
10:16  BinaryKitten: pallet i'm confused with that too
10:16  oficina7: pallet you're making a seal of valid registration, but that html won't get a valid xhtml seal
10:16  BinaryKitten: xhtml bah
10:16  LearnerJq: BinaryKitten:thanks a lot....
10:16  BinaryKitten: LearnerJq np
10:17  LearnerJq: Clarkfischer:thanks a lot tooo
10:17  BinaryKitten: I'm planning on ssomething similar to Zend_Framework
10:17  clarkfischer: You're welcome
10:17  oficina7: pallet you're gonna run in css conflict problems very soon
10:18  pallet: oficina7, why ?
10:19  clarkfischer: ID's are necessarily supposed to be unique.
10:20  clarkfischer: At the very least document.getElementById('nonUniqueId') will only return the first elment with id 'nonUniqueId'
10:20  oficina7: clarkfischer +1
10:20  clarkfischer: That's what classes are for!
10:20  oficina7: jQuery WILL break this rule, but that doesn't make it right
10:21  clarkfischer: Well, that's why jQuery's awesome ;)
10:21  oficina7: +2
10:21  pallet: all my id's are prefixed with #psw3563...
10:22  pallet: unless they are in the iframe, but at that point it's all wrapped so it could be called anything
10:22  oficina7: pallet you know what... 1 against 2, you're probably right and we don't know what we're talking about
10:23  oficina7: I'm sorry I made alcuadrado's notation a whole talk, for real
10:23  oficina7: the code will work
10:23  pallet: dude's I'm sorry, didn't mean to get peoples backs yp
10:23  pallet: *up
10:23  oficina7: browsers won't complain
10:23  oficina7: it WILL look more readable
10:24  oficina7: I'm the one to apologize
10:28  oficina7: hey guys, does anybody know how to implement jquery-ui default textures?
10:29  clarkfischer: oficina7: You mean the style?
10:29  clarkfischer: 'theme' rather?
10:29  oficina7: yes, is there a style for those diagonal lines with transparency?
10:30  oficina7: it's just for this one button
10:30  clarkfischer: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ I believe UI Lightness is the 'default'
10:30  clarkfischer: Under the gallery tab on the left
10:31  oficina7: yes, I'm using smoothness theme actually
10:31  clarkfischer: Oh
10:31  clarkfischer: You mean how do you make a <button> look like a jQuery UI <button>?
10:31  oficina7: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller here you can make ALL ui-widget-contet have diagonal-lines background
10:32  oficina7: clarkfischer no
10:32  pallet: ok guys I'm outta here, thanks for you help, sorry about p**ing people off
10:32  oficina7: pallet I'm the one sorry
10:32  oficina7: I'm not joking
10:33  oficina7: clarkfischer check this link
10:33  oficina7: omg its long
10:34  oficina7: http://bit.ly/foYBJa
10:34  clarkfischer: Ah
10:34  clarkfischer: So you just needed to roll your own theme?
10:35  oficina7: so
10:35  oficina7: I don't want all my ui-widget-content to look like that
10:35  oficina7: I only want this special one to
10:35  oficina7: look like that
10:36  oficina7: is there a class I can add to the tag so it implements such style?
10:36  clarkfischer: Are you using that theme? Or still the smoothness theme?
10:37  oficina7: smoothness
10:37  oficina7: Background color & texture
10:37  clarkfischer: You'll probably have to grab that image
10:37  oficina7: defaults are
10:37  oficina7: #ffffff flat 75%
10:37  oficina7: I wanna change that
10:38  clarkfischer: And .stripes { background: #C43131 url(dledimg) 50% 50% repeat; }
10:38  oficina7: omg, grab that? =/
10:38  clarkfischer: The image isn't big
10:38  oficina7: I know but it sucks :P
10:38  oficina7: like, I can add one of default icons, can't I?
10:38  oficina7: ui-icon ui-icon-print
10:39  oficina7: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-print"></span>
10:39  clarkfischer: does ui-icon have what you're looking for?
10:39  clarkfischer: or ui-icon-print?
10:39  oficina7: is there a <span class="ui-texture ui-texture-stripes"></span>
10:39  oficina7: ?
10:40  oficina7: no I don't means icons
10:40  oficina7: I was making a comparisson
10:40  clarkfischer: Doubtful.
10:41  oficina7: you understood what I need, right?
10:41  clarkfischer: You want to make a single div have that striped background image
10:41  clarkfischer: right?
10:41  oficina7: I am so gonna submit a bunch of .ui-texture to jquery-ui
10:41  oficina7: yes
10:42  clarkfischer: Yeah, smoothness doesn't have any textures, it doesn't look like
10:42  oficina7: like I can add ui-state-highlight  or ui-state-error
10:42  clarkfischer: so you'll have to grab it and implement it yourself
10:42  oficina7: I want to add a class and make it look different
10:43  clarkfischer: Right, but smoothness's css doesn't have any striped backgrounds
10:43  clarkfischer: You could roll your own custom smoothness-variant that does...
10:44  clarkfischer: Or you could just add it to the smoothness.css you've already got
10:44  oficina7: I just checked the file
10:44  oficina7: jquery-ui.css
10:44  oficina7: there's no ui-texture class
10:45  oficina7: I think I'm gonna take a few minutes and add those myself :P
10:48  oficina7: omg that can't be done!
10:48  oficina7: url("images/ui-bg_glass_95_fef1ec_1x400.png") repeat-x scroll 50% 50% #FEF1EC
10:48  oficina7: url("../images/?new=fef1ec&w=40&h=40&f=png&q=100&fltr[]=over|textures/08_diagonals_thick.png|0|0|95") repeat scroll 50% 50% #FEF1EC

10:56  dr0id: someone help me out here http://jsfiddle.net/APmv3/
10:57  clarkfischer: What's the problem?
10:57  dr0id: when you click add another second time, it won't add a input
10:58  clarkfischer: textBox is available within the global scope
10:58  dr0id: hmm ?
10:58  dr0id: it's also available in local scope, isn't it ?
10:58  clarkfischer: yes, it is
10:59  clarkfischer: but it creates a dom node on the first click then before's it
10:59  clarkfischer: on the second click, it's referencing the already created node, and before'ing it again (thus just moving the second one around)
11:00  dr0id: aah, ic
11:00  dr0id: clarkfischer: could you make it work ?
11:00  clarkfischer: how about $('input.input').clone().appendTo($('a.addTextBox').parent())
11:00  clarkfischer: no need to have textBox variable
11:01  dr0id: not appentTo
11:01  dr0id: or else it will add after the link
11:02  clarkfischer: http://jsfiddle.net/APmv3/1/
11:02  Nonpython: With jQuery UI's tabs, if a link in one tab leads to another, does the tab change to the other tab?
11:02  clarkfischer: ah
11:02  dr0id: this works, http://jsfiddle.net/APmv3/2/
11:02  dr0id: but the code doesn't seems gr8
11:03  clarkfischer: http://jsfiddle.net/APmv3/3/

11:12  snoopM: Hi, I've looked at a couple of sites with a sortable list and I can't locate where they are declaring which element is sortable. Where else can they be declaring it ?
11:13  clarkfischer: snoopM: jQuery UI?
11:14  snoopM: yeah, but I can't locate where the would setting $(".someClass").sortable...
11:14  snoopM: I tried looking at it via Firebug, but it wasn't much help and I've gone through all their scripts
11:15  clarkfischer: well, once the dom's ready
11:16  clarkfischer: you can just $('select-the-whole-list-here').sortable();
11:16  clarkfischer: so like:
11:16  clarkfischer: $(function () { $('ul.sortable').sortable(); });
11:17  oficina7: +1
11:18  snoopM: So if there is no mention of .sortable in the html file, the script files etc... where else would it be.
11:19  clarkfischer: If the page is using jQuery UI, it's gotta be there somewhere.
11:20  snoopM: hmm ok thanks I'll keep looking
11:21  dyjytyl: i have a parent div, and it has a few nested children.  how would i find one of the parent div's children that has an attribute called "aria-valuemax"
11:21  dyjytyl: would it be like $("parentDiv").child(:has['aria-valuemax']) ?
11:22  clarkfischer: $('parentDiv').child('[aria-valuemax]')?
11:22  clarkfischer: http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
11:22  oficina7: where does '[]' come from?
11:22  clarkfischer: er, .children
11:23  clarkfischer: [] is the attribute selector
11:23  clarkfischer: It's from sizzle i think
11:23  oficina7: oh, that would work even with no tag,id or class selector, cool
11:23  oficina7: just learned that one
11:24  clarkfischer: I think * is implied if you don't specify anything
11:24  dyjytyl: hmm
11:24  dyjytyl: not sure if that works
11:25  dyjytyl: i have one div with nested children, not getting anywhere there
11:25  dyjytyl: firebug shows me the 3 children divs though
11:25  clarkfischer: .children() only returns direct children
11:25  clarkfischer: are you looking for .find()?
11:26  clarkfischer: ?.find()
11:26  bot-t: .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
11:26  dyjytyl: how would you use find with children?
11:26  dyjytyl: if children only gets the direct children
11:28  clarkfischer: No need
11:28  clarkfischer: Find looks through children, children of children, etc
11:28  clarkfischer: All 'descendants'
11:28  clarkfischer: $('parentDiv').find('[aria-valuemax]')
11:28  dyjytyl: ah sweet
11:29  dyjytyl: so now im stuck because i thought setting aria-valuemax would fix my problem but it doesn't
11:29  clarkfischer: just fyi
11:29  dyjytyl: im using jquery mobile and i have a slider, i am trying to change it's max value, but both the max value and aria-valuemax don't work
11:29  clarkfischer: setting non-standard attributes on elements is not a great idea
11:29  dyjytyl: its fine in this case
11:31  clarkfischer: I'm not familiar at all with jquery moble, unfortunately...
11:32  dyjytyl: hm
11:32  dyjytyl: its just resetting the max value doesn't work i suppose
11:33  dyjytyl: i can do it on jquery ui's slider, but not the mobile version =[
11:33  dyjytyl: i'll figure out a workaround
11:34  clarkfischer: did you try $(obj).attr('max', 'newvalue')?
11:35  dyjytyl: yeah
11:35 --- webflo1 is now known as webflo
11:35  dyjytyl: thats the regular max value.. and i also tried the aria-valuemax. no luck =[
11:35  dyjytyl: it just stays stuck on whatever it was previously.. i think the framework needs refreshed because there's probably code responsible for it somewhere else
11:37  Vorspire: 'max' is supposed to be 'maxsize' or 'maxlength' or something isn't it?
11:38  Vorspire: ahh sliders
11:39  clarkfischer: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/#docs/forms/forms-slider.html
11:39  clarkfischer: this would suggest it's 'min' and 'max'.
11:40  clarkfischer: I'm not sure what aria- does.
11:40  mathi: hi
11:41  mathi: in the error callback of $.ajax(), how do I detect an error on timeout ?
11:44  Vorspire: clarkfischer; is the jqm version of slider based on jqui version? if so, why not try; .slider({ max: 123 })
11:44  clarkfischer: I dunno
11:45  Vorspire: mathi; ajax will return success even if the data is unavailable when it times-out, which is silly :P
11:46  mathi: Vorspire, no the error callback is called on timeout
11:46  clarkfischer: textStatus === 'timeout'
11:46  mathi: FYI I found out, had to check the second parameter in error callback for string timeout, like  if(status === 'timeout')
11:47  mathi: yeh thanks
11:47  Vorspire: ?source get: function
11:47  bot-t: Line#230 - "get: function( num ) { return num == null ? this.toArray() : ( num < 0 ? this.slice(num)[ 0 ] : this[ num ] ); }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#230
11:47  Vorspire: heh
11:51  Vorspire: mathi; seems the source will only call the error handler when success !== "success" - which would only happen if the XML request failed with parsing issues (just looking at source)
11:58  morphic: Hi. when using parseJson() i can walk my json and get values, how can I get the key? like { teste: '1' }, i need the word teste.
12:00  Kambfhase: morphic: use a for in loop
12:01  juha_: no drugs or nuclear weapons allowed inside
12:01  Vorspire: (morphic): jsonData.teste maybe?
12:02  morphic: well i don't know the key name... it is variable..
12:02  mathi: is there a way to restart the ajax request ?
12:03  morphic: Kambfhase: yes, i can get the value with a for
12:03  Vorspire: mathi; if you put the ajaz call inside of a custom function and make it recurse itself on fail/error/timeout, then yes

12:07  Vorspire: ok looking
12:07  gym_jane: thanks
12:08  Vorspire: gym_jane, i found that appling the "display: table-cell" attribute makes div's stack nicely side-by-side, set the content to "display: table" too, test and let me know :)
12:09  Vorspire: applYing*
12:10  gym_jane: is that crossbrowser?
12:10  Vorspire: gym_jane; so .box should have display: table-cell - remove the float stuff (since its screwey x-browser sometimes)
12:11  Vorspire: well my findings, table-cell is cross browser
12:11  Vorspire: i can show you an example if you wish
12:11  gym_jane: what about the spacing between the boxes?
12:12  Vorspire: well table-cll basically treats the div as a td
12:12  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/
12:13  clarkfischer: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#t06

13:32  tsyrak: i suspect it unescapes the data passed to it at some point

13:34  tsyrak: i've tried playing with the processData and traditional values also but it doesn't seem to make a difference

15:25  saba: if you want to break the UTC syntax in order to calculate something, you shouldn't use regex eh
15:30  mekwall: BlaDe^: took me two tries though.... not good! need more coffee :D
15:30  BlaDe^: heh we all make regex fails sometimes :p
15:30  BlaDe^: (\d){1} would've worked I think
15:30  mekwall: well I'm not really into regexp :P
15:31  mekwall: for me it's like a crypto
15:32  Kambfhase: BlaDe^: {1} srsly?
15:33  BlaDe^: Kambfhase:  ?
15:34  Kambfhase: why not just (\d)
15:34  oficina7: can anybody indicate a paginator that looks like iPhone?
15:35  BlaDe^: Kambfhase:  because that'd match 11 too
15:35  oficina7: something like an accordion without the tabs in the middle
15:35  oficina7: just before and after, vertically
15:35  oficina7: ??
15:35  oficina7: :P

15:36  Psychokinesics: Hi room, took me a while to find this channel but wondering if someone can point me towards some jquery stuff that allows me to have a dropdown with a checkbox like gmail which allows me to select all read messages or unread or starred etc messages in my private message inbox?
15:36  mekwall: saba_: are you sure? :P
15:36  BlaDe^: but I have 0 and wanted 00
15:37  mekwall: Kambfhase: blame me, I was the one who came up with that shitty solution haha
15:37  saba_: BlaDe^: aha, the other way? well use a printf syntax
15:37  BlaDe^: <BlaDe^> true. in php thre's number_format or sprintf which would work
15:37  mekwall: Kambfhase: i'm good at many thing, regexp not being one of them :)

15:39  gym_jane: how can i fadein/fadeout bg images for   <a href="#" class="bluebutton">read more&hellip;</a>
15:40  gym_jane: bluebutton has a hover state
15:40  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/show/ <-- can someone help me test this out in different environments?
15:40  mekwall: I want to make sure it's mature to release
15:41  Kambfhase: I have a dozen of browser on my PC which one do you need?
15:41  mekwall: well I'm on windows, tried ff3.6 and chrome already
15:41  doberman: beastman: for that json question, when you do $.ajax() just set dataType: "json" and you'll have it as array
15:41  mekwall: if I were at work I'd be able to test macos and linux as well :P but it's saturday! wooo
15:44  beastman: doberman, so i just echo json_encode (which returns { "foo" , "bar"} ) and var myArray = .ajax will work?
15:46  gym_jane: anyone?
15:47  doberman: beastman: actually, var myArray;  $.ajax({type:"GET",url:"get_json.php",dataType:"json",sucess:function(data){ myArray = data; }}); and you'll have it as myArray :-)
15:48  beastman: awesome man thank you
15:48  doberman: s/sucess/success/
15:50  tsyrak: beastman: to retrieve an array using json you can use json2.js from json.org
15:51  tsyrak: well nvm
15:51  tsyrak: you don't even need it that way around
15:51  tsyrak: just var vbdata = <?php echo myvar; ?>
15:51  erichynds: $.parseJSON ?
15:52  doberman: Well, my bad if he didn't want it with ajax :-)
15:53  mekwall: god damn it
15:53  mekwall: I hate jsfiddles "set to base" not working properly
15:53  mekwall: erichynds: oh hai!

15:55  doberman: isn't it BETA ?
15:55  mekwall: yeah
15:55  mekwall: very close to release though
15:55  doberman: but very far from good
15:56  mekwall: hehe yeah
15:56  mekwall: but way better then anything
15:56  doberman: if anything is other ie versions :)
15:56  Thasmo: gym_jane, not sure - but I think it's impossible to fade background imagaes. you needa use a workaround I think, like using a separate element or something.
15:57  gym_jane: ok thanks
15:57  tsyrak: you need use a wrapper around the item gym_jane
15:57  gym_jane: any examples out there?
15:57  tsyrak: well i haven't done it with jquery
15:57  gym_jane: cudn't find anything on text links
15:57  tsyrak: but i used to do smth similar, you just play wit hthe opacity of the parent that has a bg image
15:58  mekwall: Kambfhase: thanks for the help :)
15:58  Kambfhase: mekwall: w8
15:58  tsyrak: gym_jane: try wrapping it inside a span and playing with the span instead
15:58  tsyrak: see what happens
15:58  gym_jane: right let me try that
15:58  gym_jane: thank you

16:04  mekwall: haha
16:04  Stavros: yeah, it was a while ago :p
16:04  mekwall: indeed
16:04  Stavros: now, is it possible to perform an event after another event completes? i'm doing fadeOut().remove() but that just removes the thing
16:04  Stavros: and i don't want to do fadeOut(function() {this.remove()}) as it's too verbose

16:10  Ely2: would like to install it on my VM
16:10  Ely2: ow got it :p
16:11  doberman: Google's smart :)
16:11  ss23: IE9 beta has been out for a while right?
16:11  Ely2: yes
16:11  doberman: I'm afraid my e-banking won't work on IE9, since it's created when there was IE5.5 :D
16:11  Ely2: not really a IE fan

16:12  [M]ax: how would i go about making a jquery plugin think that i have clicked on an element to trick it to fire?
16:13  doberman: .click()
16:13  [M]ax: i thought .click was a listen event
16:14  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Md98w/3/ <--- should have fixed the last things now
16:15  Ely2: that's nice :)
16:16  doberman: [M]ax: well, you can fake a click by doing $(selector).click();
16:16  doberman: Kambfhase you still here ?
16:17  Ely2: .trigger('click');
16:17  Ely2: ?
16:17  doberman: or that
16:18  sdgsdg: how can a sortable be dropped in a droppable without triggering "drop"?  it's happening to me and i'm loosing my mind...
16:18  Stavros: is it possible to perform an event after another event completes? i'm doing fadeOut().remove() but that just removes the element right away instead of after the fadeOut
16:19 * doberman is looking for someone using IE9 to tell what http://jsfiddle.net/b7zGJ/ returns ?
16:19  doberman: Stavros: .fadeOut( [ duration ], [ callback ] )
16:20  Stavros: doberman: anything less verbose?
16:20  Stavros: doberman: also, how can i access my element in callback?
16:21  doberman: Stavros: this
16:21  Stavros: ah, thanks
16:21  Stavros: let me try that
16:21  Stavros: isn't there some sort of event chaining?
16:23  doberman: Stavros: I think you can use .end() , something like this fadeOut().end().remove()
16:23  doberman: I'm not sure, but you can try that.
16:24  mekwall: grrr
16:24  mekwall: only one problem remains
16:24  ss23: One problem too many!
16:25  Stavros: doberman: ah, that's good, thanks

22:48  Trixer: http://pastie.org/1464896
22:48  Trixer: I have narrowed it down to the .get if I remove it then I can pop it as many times as I want
22:50  Trixer: and for the life of me cant figure why on earth it would be doing that... maybe it has something to do with the .append like unloading my ui stuff?
22:50  Trixer: everything else works fine though so I seriously doubt its that
22:53  Cagelin: doesn't $.get block the browser until the request is complete?
22:53  Cagelin: try using $.ajax({}); manually

22:53  Trixer: is there a way I can see if the request has completed?

22:54  Trixer: ahh ok
