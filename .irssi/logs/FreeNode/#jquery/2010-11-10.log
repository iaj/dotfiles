08:42  philk_: I have 22 AJAX request i send simultanously. It happens that one or two of them fail everythime although the resource is there and on a second request the resource can be fetched. I guess it has to to with limits in the browsers async HTTP component (Firefox). So I should probably queue up the 22 ajax calls and only send the next request when the previous completed?

08:52  bjornbjorn: philk_: yes, a browser only allows a certain amount of simulataneous requests .. you can also divide the requests over several subdomains for example
08:52  bjornbjorn: to allow for more
08:53  toxz: how can i check if an element is an input or select?
08:53  philk_: bjornbjorn: ok, will use the ajax queue plugin then

08:58  juha___: has anyone else noticed that 1.4.3 breaks colorbox plugin?
08:58  xotix: i need to reset a form. somehwo i dont get it with normal js. is there somethign from jquery? its an aajx form.
08:59  mekwall: xotix, reset as in set everything to empty?
08:59  mekwall: xotix, or do you need it to be as it were when the page loaded?
08:59  juha___: oh, i seem to be using old version of the plugin
09:00  xotix: like vlau="". i know i could loop through the form but maybe there is something .reset(); but i havent found anything.
09:00  mekwall: xotix, well... a reset function would still loop through the form :p
09:01  xotix: yeah but then i dont have to write the func by myself :P but seems liek i have to.
09:01  mekwall: xotix, so there's no real need for it... $('#form-id').find('input, select, textarea').each(function(){ $(this).val(''); });
09:02  xotix: uh
09:04  xotix: but that i have to do for each element type rigth? checkboxes, textarea, text etc.
09:05  toxz: can i append an array of elements with one command?
09:07  harovali1: mekwall: hi , please enlighten me : is it correct to use the following syntax   $("whatever", arbitraryXmlString)    , and pretend jquery to operate over the Xml like if of the DOM it were ?

09:21  joshsmith: does anyone know about how to listen for pastes on an iframe?
09:21  joshsmith: dynamically inserted iframe, that is
09:21  joshsmith: .live('paste') simply ain't workin'
09:21  Cork: joshsmith: is the iframes content on the same domain?
09:22  joshsmith: Cork: yes indeed
09:22  Cork: you most likly have to bind it to the document.body of the iframe
09:22  Cork: but not sure
09:22  joshsmith: I'm trying $('iframe').contents().find('body')
09:22  Cork: (i stay as far away from iframes as i posibly can)
09:23  joshsmith: me, too. but it's for a wysiwyg editor, so alas, alack, it must be dealt with
09:23  Cork: joshsmith: last i fiddled with iframes, it looked like you can't dom travle cross the iframe in jquery
09:23  mekwall: Cork, any reason as to why it wouldn't select the body element from the xml string?
09:23  mekwall: bug perhaps?
09:24  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: i see it in firebug? ^^
09:24  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, what?!
09:24  mekwall: bah
09:24  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: yes, but no with <body>
09:24  mekwall: chrome aint showing it
09:24  sean`: yes, but with no <booty>
09:24  mekwall: exactly, it ait hitting the booty :p
09:25  mekwall: I guess that's a bug then
09:26  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: well it outputs the body-text but without <body></body>

09:27  Gelegrod1n: i clicked it in firebu
09:27  Gelegrod1n: g
09:27  Gelegrod1n: and it jumps to HTML
09:27  Gelegrod1n: and there i can see it
09:27  mekwall: eh?
09:28  mekwall: what html?
09:28  Gelegrod1n: html tab in firebug
09:28  mekwall: it's xml in a string
09:28  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, dude... you a re watching the body of jsfiddle haha
09:28  Gelegrod1n: no..
09:28  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, check the code... it's only a string, nothing is appended to the dom
09:29  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: i know
09:29  Gelegrod1n: well let me check agaig..
09:29  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: in console, press "to"
09:30  Gelegrod1n: and firebug jumps too HTML tab
09:30  Gelegrod1n: and it shows the XML
09:30  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, indeed it does... well that is weird now isnt' it? :)
09:30  Gelegrod1n: dude.. im not watching the body of jsfiddle ^^
09:31  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, I thought so... but it's weird how the body element disappears altogether
09:31  mekwall: must be a bug with the jquery parser
09:31  Gelegrod1n: well its not a element, its the body-text :P
09:31  joshsmith: omg, I think this is doing an iframe within an iframe
09:31  joshsmith: this i sterrible
09:32  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, in the string it's a body element
09:32  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, <body>Why is it not hitting this?</body> <--- only the text node is left
09:32  mekwall: after it goes through jquery
09:32  Gelegrod1n: yes
09:33  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, and that must be a bug :)
09:33  mekwall: that means you will not be able to parse any body-element from a string
09:33  Gelegrod1n: hm, or it handles the <body> in a special way :P
09:33  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, which it shouldn't
09:33  mekwall: doesn't make any sense to do that
09:33  Gelegrod1n: well guess it depends how you want to structure your xml?
09:33  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, no...
09:34  mekwall: valid html, xml or whatever should be parsable
09:34  Gelegrod1n: so its concidered invalid?
09:34  mekwall: no :)
09:34  Gelegrod1n: im not 100% with xml, but have seen code simliar too that?
09:34  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp
09:34  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, it's a copy paste from that example :)
09:35  Gelegrod1n: just parsing the "body" in the whole.. euhm..dunno what its called.. root element
09:35  Gelegrod1n: root node
09:35  Gelegrod1n: maybe
09:35  kvtada: where should I write javascript code? in same file or saperate file?
09:35  mekwall: well shouldn't matter if it was named body or booty
09:35  mekwall: but it does :D
09:35  Gelegrod1n: kvtada: seperate
09:36  mekwall: kvtada, depends on how much it is
09:36  Gelegrod1n: oneliners can be used in same file :P
09:36  mekwall: kvtada, if it's js just for one page then you can have it in the same page

09:36  Mimo: i could not find a good article on how i can cache my ajax call (any ideas how i should handle approach this)
09:36  Gelegrod1n: for caching :)
09:36  mekwall: Mimo, it's very easy
09:37  Mimo: really?
09:37  kvtada: Ok thank you all
09:37  Mimo: not by ajax call it self
09:37  Gelegrod1n: its on as default mekwall  :)
09:37  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, ajax caching is just about sending if-modified or not
09:37  mekwall: and setting cache headers
09:37  Gelegrod1n: yes
09:37  Mimo: cause the cache from ajax itself makes the call over and over again
09:37  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, it will still do a second request
09:38  Gelegrod1n: its more server-side than client-side i would say
09:38  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, Mimo doesn't want that :)
09:38  Gelegrod1n: ah
09:38  Gelegrod1n: thats different
09:38  mekwall: yup
09:38  Mimo: haha i do :P
09:38  mekwall: Mimo, just do this: request = $.ajax()
09:38  mekwall: and check if request is set or not
09:38  mekwall: if it's set then there's already been a request
09:38  Mimo: ok roger will try thanks
09:39  Gelegrod1n: uh, maybe  i should work
09:39  Gelegrod1n: instead of irc..
09:39  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, irc is work :)
09:39  Gelegrod1n: haha

09:42  JKarsrud: So_High do you need the <= ?
09:42  JKarsrud: Are you sure you don't mean i < filters.length
09:42  So_High: well, I deleted the < and it froze firefox multipe times
09:42  JKarsrud: don't delete the <, delete the =
09:42  So_High: oh, yeah! sorry, total noob
09:42  JKarsrud: :P
09:42  So_High: thanks man!
09:43  So_High: works perfect
09:43  JKarsrud: And just a pro tip
09:43  JKarsrud: cache your filters.length
09:43  So_High: um, sorry but I've no clue how to cache in the first place
09:43  JKarsrud: like var ln = filters.length
09:43  swe_ET: i++ vs ++i ?
09:43  JKarsrud: swe_ET not a problem
09:44  JKarsrud: So_High: do what I said.
09:44  Gelegrod1n: So_High: else it checks filters.length for each loop :)
09:44  swe_ET: whats the diff?
09:44  JKarsrud: Gelegrod1n: exactly :)
09:44  swe_ET: in a loop like that..
09:44  So_High: lol, trust me, I want to do what you said, I have no clue how
09:44  Gelegrod1n: swe_ET: ++i does it before, i++ after
09:44  Gelegrod1n: the addition
09:45  So_High: I promise to look into it
09:45  swe_ET: so he never gets a 0 ?
09:45  JKarsrud: So_High: Instead of having filters.length inside the loop, you could put it in a var. That way you won't have to check the length each time
09:46  JKarsrud: var ln = filters.length; for(var i = 0; i < ln; i++) { //code here }
09:46  So_High: oh, sweet, will do
09:46  mekwall: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7456
09:46  mekwall: just posted a ticket about it
09:46  JKarsrud: Might no matter much in your loop here, but it's a tip either way =)
09:46  So_High: got it man, damn... I've got to do that on a lot of loops now
09:47  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: Please use  jsFiddle when providing test cases and demonstrations instead of pasting the code in the ticket.
09:47  Gelegrod1n: :)
09:47  mekwall: Gelegrod1n, I know... but it's so little code so it doesn't matter
09:47  mekwall: only two rows :)
09:47  JKarsrud: So_High: You don't have to, but in the long run, it will help performance :)
09:47  Gelegrod1n: mekwall: but easy to confirm :P
09:47  Gelegrod1n: else are lazy
09:47  Gelegrod1n: people*

10:20  joshsmith: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4142860/jquery-regex-to-extract-all-html-except-br-bold-italic-and-a
10:21  philk_: mekwall: sounds good. I also always install nginx but my clients never heard of it before
10:21  mekwall: philk_, clients also want ie6 support...
10:22  joshsmith: Scalr uses nginx by default for load balancing
10:22  philk_: mekwall: you right... I hope I will leave this project behind me soon
10:22  mekwall: philk_, clients need to learn that what they know is knowledge that is lagging a couple of years behind
10:23  mekwall: philk_, and we all know that a couple of years in IT, is a LONG time :)
10:23  finfin82: mekwall: you gave me a hint to use jquerys .proxy function to deal with my problem yesterday.... there was a time-critical issue... using async ajax-calls and return object.attributes
10:23  jigz: does anyone know why this || operator would break this if statement? if(bugMessage != '' || bugMessage != 'empty')
10:23  SugaSlide: suuuuuuuuuuo
10:23  mekwall: SugaSlide, sup*
10:23  SugaSlide: (typo for sup)
10:23  finfin82: can you give me an example please? i read alot but dunno how to deal correctly with that
10:23  mekwall: I corrected it for you
10:24  SugaSlide: i see so :D thanks
10:24  philk_: Cork: the demo site for ajax does not work either, btw.
10:25  lanmower: lo all :)
10:26  finfin82: mekwall: here is my "object" :-) http://jsfiddle.net/g9yfq/
10:26  lanmower: quick question... I want to hide all forms and then show one of them... if I call hide on them all and then show on the one I want to see nothing happens (I guess it ends up hiding after showing.
10:26  lanmower: how can I select all divs except that one by id?
10:26  finfin82: i want to get the correct value when calling getMediaList... no matter if there has to be called ajax or not
10:27  markj: ?not @ lanmower
10:27  bot-t: lanmower, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
10:29  finfin82: can somebody give me a hint?
10:29  lanmower: hmm... the following code shows the form I wish to see, without hiding anything.
10:29  lanmower:                         $("#"+$selected+"Form").show();
10:29  lanmower: but the following does nothing
10:29  lanmower:                         $("#"+$selected+"Form").show();
10:29  lanmower:                         $("#forms div").not("#"+$selected+"Form").hide();

10:30  markj: ?paste @ lanmower
10:30  bot-t: lanmower, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
10:30  lanmower: soz, I'll use pastebin in the future.
10:30  finfin82: here is my code again... if sombody can help me to deal with the ajax-async problem http://jsfiddle.net/g9yfq/
10:31  lanmower: http://jsfiddle.net/79rpa/
10:32  lanmower: if I comment out the second line my form shows normally, if I have the second line, nothing happens.
10:33  finfin82: mekwall: ? you said i should use jQuery.proxy ... i dont know exactly how....
10:33  finfin82: can you point me in the right direction?
10:34  philk__: how do custom queues work? Do I first have to put everything in the queue and then run (how?) this queue or can I mark a queue as running always and as soon as new items are put into the queue their are run sequentially?
10:34  markj: lanmower do you have a live demo at all? or could you paste the html + js into the fiddle?
10:34  lanmower: now as far as I understand, the second line should only affect elements not excluded by the not statement, but it doesnt.
10:34  mekwall: finfin82, so you can send the current object to the callback
10:35  finfin82: can you pls do it in my source so i get an idea?
10:35  finfin82: its a basic problem, that blocks my whole conzept right now :-/

10:40  lanmower: http://jsfiddle.net/79rpa/2/ has the dropdown added that runs the jquery block.
10:41  lanmower: the idea is if I select audio from the list, the audio form appears and it hides the other forms.
10:42  lanmower: I also tried to hide all the forms and then show the one I want, but I have no idea how to make it happen in the proper order.
10:43  monkeynut: morning all :)
10:48  lanmower: meh
10:49  finfin82: mekwall: ? help me pls ;-)

10:51  mekwall: finfin82, I don't have time to rewrite your code... sry
10:51  finfin82: it should not be that much?

11:00 --- Northwoods is now known as Northwoods|Away
11:00  finfin82: i allready tried several things... (since yesterday)
11:01  Graloth: I'm quite new to ajax, and have a small question... I need to submit a URL in the background, but never show it, as it simply submits a new value, the url doesn't return anything as it is an external system... how do i go about doing that?
11:01 @coldhead: if i had ops i would kick mekwall for not being more helpful
11:01 @coldhead: but alas, i can only dream
11:02  monkeynut: @finfin82 ... so, what did you try and what were the problems?
11:02  monkeynut: @Graloth you would want to use $.get or $.post functions
11:02  finfin82: monkeynut: first i read alot about the proxy-idea
11:02  Graloth: monkeynut: thanks
11:03  finfin82: then i tried to replace the direct callback-call by the proxy call... it didnt work
11:03  monkeynut: no probs Graloth, if you have problems implementing it, come back, but the online documentation is pretty good ...
11:04  finfin82: i guess i dont understand the idea behind the proxy-stuff
11:04  Graloth: yeah, jquery probably has the most noob friendly documentation i've seen :P
11:04  monkeynut: @finfin82 ... i'm sorry, i've been lost in all sorts of other coding ... can you give me the link to the code and description of problem to refresh my memory?
11:04  finfin82: *gg*
11:05  finfin82:  http://jsfiddle.net/g9yfq/ <-- my code... the problem is, that async ajax-calls go further in code and the callback is called some times later... so my function doesnt return a value if there is nessesary to call .get-function
11:08  philk__: instead of "td:first').next().text(text);" i could also write?
11:08  monkeynut: @finfin82 ... alrighty then, sounds like standard messy thread problem ... I'll take a quick look
11:08  finfin82: thx alot
11:09  monkeynut: @philk__ $('td:eq(1)').text(text);
11:09  philk__: monkeynut: thanks :)
11:09  monkeynut: @philk__ do you understand why that works?
11:09  finfin82: one resolution could be to replace .get by .ajax and do async=false call... but that will block the whole code
11:10  monkeynut: @finfin82 ... there's almost always a solution that doesn't involve blocking the code and using async requests
11:10  finfin82: thats my hope ;-)
11:12  philk__: monkeynut: yes I do understand
11:13  monkeynut: :)
11:13  SugaSlide: wow
11:13  SugaSlide: another fight with the ex boss :(
11:13 * SugaSlide slits wrists horizontaly
11:13  Graloth: monkeynut: just want to make sure, if i pass a function as the second argument for either .get() or .post(), whatever i do inside that function will first be done when the URL passed to the .get()/.post() function has finished loading?
11:14  monkeynut: @finfin82 ... unfortunately you will have to jiggle your code round quite a bit, you are trying to get a return value from a function which depends on the result of your callback ...
11:14  ElectricPrism: are there any other symbols that can be finded to a function similarly to how $() is bound to $('#elementID') in JavaScript?
11:15  ElectricPrism: binded*
11:15  monkeynut: @finfin82, the simplest solution would be to have that 'Media()' function being a method of an object and the 'return value' being set by the $.get callback actually being a property of the object Media is a method of
11:16  finfin82: Media itself is my object
11:16  monkeynut: @ElectricPrism $ is just short for jQuery
11:16  monkeynut: @finfin82, it's declared as a function in your code
11:16  mi: finfin82: as i told you in #jquery-de, if you need the data for the program flow, you need to place the rest of your logic within the callback...
11:16  Cork: ElectricPrism: thats just a character, any non used character by js is ok to use (<>!=%&|"/[]\+-.'*^)

11:25  piquadrat: Hi! I'm using jquery-ui's autocomplete widget. But when the user presses enter while writing, the form is submited. Is it possible to select the first element from the suggestions instead?

11:28  philk__: monkeynut: no, I want them both to fire... but they do not fire. Only the last specified fires
11:29  monkeynut: @philk__ that is strange, my global ajax handlers fire along with the ones I have defined for particular requests ... I assumed beforeSend worked like all the rest of those functions
11:29  piquadrat: monkeynut: the autocomplete widget has only four options, and none of them seem to match my problem
11:29  monkeynut: @philk__ can you post a link to example code?

11:31  monkeynut: @piquadrat ... the example in the doc seems to just select when enter is hit ... have you defined your own keypress event to submit this form ... I think i'll have to see your code.
11:32  monkeynut: @k1ng ... what do you mean slider? you mean the custom scroll bar?
11:32  k1ng: yes
11:32  k1ng: on the div
11:33  monkeynut: @k1ng ... if you view source on the page ... you can see the jscroller.js function they use ...
11:34  row: hmm ui is still shipping with 1.4.2
11:34  k1ng: thanks mate
11:34  xotix: hi
11:35  monkeynut: however, the principle is simple, so you could easily roll your own custom one ... simply have 2 divs inside a container, one large to have content and one thin to be the scrollbar ... do your css and use something like ui.draggable for the button in the slider
11:35  Guest60125: I'm trying to get images that are appended to a UL to .fadeIn() on .load() but I just seem to be missing something: http://pastebin.com/FXKzaPP3
11:35  xotix: i got a dialog. i init it at the document ready. in the dialgo i got some generated stuff. how can i say to the dialog, always match the size of the content?
11:36  monkeynut: @k1ng ... i'm pretty sure there's a few plugins that will suit your needs, if you don't like them I suggest you use draggable from the jquery UI along with scrollTop to change the div content's scroll position
11:36  monkeynut: (and hide original scroll bar! :P
11:36 --- alaing is now known as alaing_away
11:37  k1ng: unn can you give me an example how do i do it
11:37  monkeynut: @xotix match the size of the content can be tricky ... I often have to resort to setting the width and height to be the sum of the with and height of all the contained elements
11:38  philk__: monkeynut: I am "duck punching" the ajax method somewhere in my code like this http://jsfiddle.net/Kwxem/
11:38  monkeynut: @k1ng .... http://www.persona.com.bd/js/jscroller.js ... that is the plugin they are using, and it's code

11:41  k1ng: yes i got firebug
11:41  monkeynut: @philk__ taking a look now
11:42  monkeynut: @k1ng ... I just opened firebug and looked at the source, saw the scroller, opened up the source and looked for it (had to use the direct link for some reason)

11:44  monkeynut: @philk__ your $.ajax function only contains an if statment!! .... reading on ...
11:44  dinosaadeh: hi guys, I am using $.ajax with the attribute success.. the .Net service replying to this ajax returns a string.. how does it know if it is success or error?
11:45  monkeynut: @k1ng ... that's the stuff, that'll do it ... great thing about jquery is there's more documentation than you can shake a stick at
11:45  k1ng: :d
11:45  Guest60125: dinosaadeh: what is the string that it returns?
11:46  monkeynut: @dinosaadeh ... the success callback will only fire if the request was successfull, if you want to do something on error put it in an error callback ....
11:46 --- alaing_away is now known as alaing
11:47  monkeynut: @dinosaadeh ... if you want to know if you .Net code sucessfully did what you want, you need to get it to put some identifialble string or something (depending on your data structure, I often use xml) to say "yup, I did what I wanted" and then look for that in the callback
11:48  philk__: monkeynut: i left out the guts of my file:/// specialized ajax implementation... its not important here, cause the url starts not with file:// so the original ajax function is called

12:22  newname: sean`: Thank you for that, I appreaciate it. Could you possibly tell me how the image could load before being faded if the src is changed after $img.load() is fired?
12:22  sean`: newname, yeah
12:22  sean`: RTFM
12:22  sean`: and read what bot-t showed you
12:22  sean`: It's all in there
12:22  BMCouto: JKarsrud enough licking him already lol
12:22  BMCouto: i love sean`
12:23  monkeynut: ooooh BMC is jealous ... :P
12:23  BMCouto: and you do wanna go out with him at night
12:23  mekwall: sean`, meetings are great fun

12:23  BMCouto: monkeynut i dont share

12:24  sean`: 10 seconds baby
12:24  mekwall: oh yeah baby!
12:24  sean`: daxroc, yes
12:24  sean`: .click () or .trigger ('click') will trigger it
12:25  sean`: Same goes for the other events, shorthand functions without an argument will trigger the event
12:25  newname: sean`: Okay, I'll give it a go. Thanks for trying, though.
12:25  sean`: ?preloading @ newname
12:25  bot-t: newname, Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src.

12:27  sean`: newname, work your magic, I can feel the force within you
12:27  sean`: you CAN do it
12:28  newname: sean`: Thanks, I'll do my best. And sorry formy English.
12:28  sean`: newname, no problemo, I'm not fluent in spanish either
12:28  newname: Thank you, room. Have a good day.

12:34  dsdeiz: sean`: i'm using this news ticker http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/newsticker/jq-liscroll/scrollanimate.html but was wondering if it would be possible to cycle to the first li rather than leaving a long whitespace

12:36  sean`: philk__, yes
12:36  monkeynut: @mekwall ... fair enough, I know it's supposed to be for stuff that *does* encryption ... but you can still use it with encryption ... I just take what the jquery docs say ... if he wants to me more sure, he should get in touch with the authorities
12:36  philk__: sean`: and how do I find out if its an input field?
12:36  mekwall: monkeynut, it's in the docs?

12:37  monkeynut: $(document).ready(function(){ loader(); });
12:37  sean`: dsdeiz, you'd have to hack it imo
12:37  acroyear2: Ahhh, thanks
12:37  dsdeiz: sean`: yeah, no problem in hacking.. just don't know where to start :D
12:38  carlesso: how can I convert a json object to equivalent string?
12:38  sean`: dsdeiz, to make it append the li's it's alredy showed to the back of the line
12:38  mekwall: acroyear2, actually... it's even better with $(function(){ loader(); }); :)
12:38  owzzz: http://pastebin.com/2BuJKrL4 cananyone tell me why this is giving me a jquery.data iscalled incorrectly?
12:38  monkeynut: @acroyear2 ... .ready takes a function ... another way of doing it is $(document).ready(loader); (without brackets)

12:45  monkeynut: @mekwall ... yeah, but it's ironic how when people get better at coding they get better at asking questions ... up to the limit where they only ask questions well when they don't really need to ask them!
12:45  sean`: that one should be upgraded

12:47  owzzz: so  .bw1 will be replaced with .col1
12:47  acroyear2: Is there a javascript sleep / wait function I could use with fadeIn() and fadeOut() to make text fade in and out?
12:47  owzzz: etc

12:49  owzzz: or*
12:49  owzzz: depending on which panel it hovers over.
12:49  owzzz: so as I hover over the panel with the class of .bw2 it will remove that class and then add a class .col2
12:49  monkeynut: @owzzz ... I understand ... just poking around

12:53  mekwall: jaypur, how much are you willing to pay?
12:53  owzzz: yeah?
12:53  monkeynut: @owzzz .... $(this) refers to the li .. you are looking at elements deeper than li, so your .find never matches ....
12:53  jaypur: mekwall, a hug
12:53  mekwall: if your name were jessica alba, I'd do it
12:53  jaypur: mekwall, hahaha
12:53  monkeynut: @owzzz ...if $(this).is('.bw'+index){$(this).addClass().removeClass();}
12:54  jaypur: mekwall, would you like to help me my friend?
12:54  Graloth: is it possible via .post() to submit a form on the URL passed to it?, turns out the URL i was given only pre-populates fields, so i need some way to also submit it
12:54  monkeynut: @jaypur ... google "jquery image gallery"
12:54  mekwall: jaypur, I suggest you try on your own... if you run into trouble you can ask in here
12:55  jaypur: mekwall, i've already installed a lot of things, but these one is not going....

12:55  monkeynut: @jaypur ... you don't "install an image gallery" !!
12:55  mekwall: jaypur, if it's not working you need to set up a test case that can easily reporoduce your problem... then I can help :)
12:55  mekwall: reproduce!
12:55  jaypur: mekwall, i say "install"
12:56  mekwall: my keys have had too much to drink, they don't know in which order they should come :/
12:56  jaypur: monkeynut,
12:56  monkeynut: @owzzz ... did that work?
12:57  mekwall: jaypur, 404 on 5 resources, in which 4 are js files...
12:57  owzzz: im getting a missing l
12:57  owzzz: ';'
12:57  owzzz: 		$(this).is('.bw'+index){$(this).addClass('col'+index).removeClass('bw'+index)};
12:57  jaypur: mekwall, a wait
12:57  mekwall: jaypur, that might point you into the right direction :p
12:57  monkeynut: @owzzz ... can you link me to your updated attempt, i'm pretty sure my suggestion should work
12:57  jaypur: mekwall, i forgot sorry, someone was talking to me here
12:57  jaypur: mekwall, no, here is all ok and it's not going wait a sec plz
12:58  owzzz: pastebin?
12:58  mekwall: yeah I usually forget things as well when someone speaks to me
12:58  owzzz: or live?
12:58  mekwall: now what were I saying?
12:58  monkeynut: @owzzz .... not $(this).is(){} .... but    if ($(this).is(blah)){ //dostuff }
12:58  jaypur: mekwall, no i say i was speaking here, and a person next to me was getting my attention lol
12:58  mekwall: :p
12:59  jaypur: sorry
12:59  jaypur: mekwall, refresh it plz
12:59  monkeynut: @owzzz ... that's saying "if this li being hovered over has this class, then remove it and replace with other class"
12:59  mekwall: jaypur: two syntax errors... one in nivo.js and one in nivo2.js
13:00  mekwall: jaypur, and do you really need to use $(window).load ? isn't .ready sufficient
13:00  jaypur: mekwall, aaah sorry
13:00  monkeynut: @owzzz ... I submitted the correction :   http://pastebin.com/HUDi71J3
13:01  monkeynut: @owzzz ... you need to do it for the other fun ;)
13:01  owzzz: i have added it to both..
13:01  jaypur: mekwall, ok, fixed and now the gallery is gone lol
13:02  mekwall: jaypur, still error in nivo2.js :/
13:02  owzzz: but it doesnt work on the return hover function
13:02  monkeynut: @owzzz ... FYI ... jquery also has a    $(this).hasClass()    method, which works like  .is(".blah") ... (but I think latter is more powerful)
13:02  mekwall: jaypur, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'substr' of undefined in the slider plugin as well... not very well coded I guess :P
13:03  mekwall: monkeynut, hasClass is faster
13:03  monkeynut: @owzzz ... can you show me the update on pastebin? it should look just like the one I put there
13:03  owzzz: http://pastebin.com/a5NxyVaw
13:03  Dr4g: monkeynut, i feel the former is more readable
13:04  monkeynut: @mekwall ... that's why I mentioned it ... but speed is rarely of the essence when someone new to jquery is coding ... I think showing more flexible methods can help get development time down ...
13:04  monkeynut: @mekwall ... good point out though ;)
13:04  jaypur: mekwall, refresh it plz
13:04  mekwall: monkeynut, well... better do it right from the beginning? :)
13:05  monkeynut: @mekwall ... maybe we're just Russel and Copleston ;)
13:05  jaypur: updating
13:06  jaypur: mekwall, and now my friend???
13:06  monkeynut: @owzzz ... that looks fine to me ... if you're sure elements of that index should be there ... try putting a console.log in the second function (outside the 'if') and another inside the if ... isolate the problem
13:07  mekwall: monkeynut,
13:07  mekwall: oops
13:07  mekwall: monkeynut, http://jsperf.com/is-vs-hasclass

13:10  monkeynut: @mekwall ... still ... it takes 1/30 milisecond ... but yeah, enough of them piled up and it will certainly start to make a difference, users definitely prefer more responsive pages
13:10  mekwall: monkeynut, well... when it comes to jQuery, it's much like Occam's razor :)
13:10  monkeynut: overused and misunderstood?
13:10  mekwall: haha

13:11  mekwall: yeah that could be true
13:11  mekwall: I still love to use it though
13:12  monkeynut: I have a masters in theoretical physics, a strong background in philosophy and logic and I believe in a creator ... I've seen occam's razor used like occam's axe
13:13  monkeynut: but yes, it's a very powerful observation, I think the reason it's so successful illuminates the heart of what meaning and thought are ... but I get the feeling it's getting a *little* off-topic ;)
13:13  jaypur: mekwall, update jquery now?
13:13  monkeynut: @jaypur  YES
13:13  mekwall: jaypur, use google js api instead of serving it yourself
13:13  monkeynut: @jaypur ... *upgrade* ... come join us ... come to the light :P
13:13  mekwall: jaypur, you are currently using 1.2 which is OLD

13:14  ohcibi: hi, i have this object: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/288790/ but when i call getBounds() the .each() is never iterating over this.counties (i checked if this.counties is not empty with firebug)
13:14  ohcibi: whats wrong?
13:14  monkeynut: @jaypur ... if anything is broken, it's probably just a malformed selector ... everything else is very compatible
13:15  mekwall: monkeynut, philosophical contemplation can never be off-topic :)
13:15  jaypur: monkeynut, yeah
13:15  jaypur: don't know what
13:15  mekwall: ohcibi, selfObj.countries?
13:16  jaypur: still not working
13:16  ohcibi: mekwall: it means this.. i tried something and forgot to remove it before pasting
13:16  monkeynut: @ohcibi ... your function just keeps calling itself and doing nothing
13:16  monkeynut: @ohcibi ... use  'this' to refer ot the current object being iterated over
13:17  ohcibi: monkeynut: wrong in paste: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/288791/ <-- this is how it looks actually
13:17  monkeynut: @ohcibi ... alrighty then, taking a look
13:18  jaypur: mekwall, would you like to take a look now?
13:18  monkeynut: @ohcibi ... that code looks like it will always reference an empty this.counties.
13:19  ohcibi: monkeynut: but why? if i add a breakpoint at the first line, firebug says this.counties has elements in it
13:19  ohcibi: monkeynut: *first line of setBounds()
13:19  ohcibi: getBounds... bah.. my head..  8-)
13:20  monkeynut: @ohcibi ... ok, so code somewhere else must be populating it, that's fine ... gimme a sec to check something
13:20  ohcibi: monkeynut: yes, before i call getBounds i add something to it... thats not quite clear in my paste, true 8-))

13:24  ohcibi: monkeynut: ah i think i get why... i get some data async via ajax.. of course..
13:25  unfo-: ohcibi, i didn't yet read what your orig. problem was, but i can tell you that i have also found a google nexus one browser bug re: animations that was fixed by adding alert(".") before the animation
13:25  unfo-: ohcibi, if you figure out what alert() could make browsers do, do tell :)
13:25  monkeynut: @ohcibi .. good work, was gonna say I think the problems not necessarily in this bit of the code ... it's quite obscure though .... always remember:  Debugging is twice as hard as writing code, so if you write to your limits it will be impossible for you to debug ;)
13:25  unfo-: monkeynut, what is the src of that quote, btw?
13:26  monkeynut: @unfo- I wish I could remember!
13:26  unfo-: i'll just google it then ;)

13:26  monkeynut: :D
13:26  monkeynut: of course ... the legend that is ...
13:26  eightfold: yes, and the element i'm speaking of above does not contain anything else but line breaks
13:27  jaypur: now its working
13:27  eightfold: i can't seem to target it
13:27  eightfold: with :empty
13:27  unfo-: monkeynut, ah yes :)

13:28  jaypur: monkeynut, wasn't upgrading, was the name of the file
13:28  jaypur: monkeynut, i'm too much tired, i'm sorry, those idiot errors, but was good to updrade
13:28  monkeynut: @unfo- you had to use a browser? I just rub my beard on the raw eth cable to send the signal and read the response with my eyes
13:29  monkeynut: :P
13:29  jaypur: monkeynut, didn't hurt
13:29  unfo-: monkeynut, hahahha, awesome visual ;D
13:29  eightfold: i'm looking for a selector that targets something that doesn't contain a specific string
13:29  monkeynut: @jaypur ... it's a testament to the jquery dev team how compatible their code is :)
13:29  eightfold: possible?
13:29  ohcibi: monkeynut: it works if i load it synchronously
13:30  jaypur: monkeynut, i really love jquery
13:30  eightfold: find() only searches elements, right?

13:30  lanmower: })(jQuery);
13:30  lanmower: I have a extension that starts and ends with that...
13:31  monkeynut: @eightfold ... I don't think there's a built in selector ... you could manually loop through a type of element and regex their text
13:31  lanmower: can I assume that if jquery gets loaded via ajax at all it will break some of its bindings?
13:31  monkeynut: @ohcibi .. is that a good enough solution for you?
13:32  muszek: hi... simple question.  I have selected #foo and want to add #bar to the list of selected elements before I trigger a common event on them... how do I do the "add new elements" part?
13:32  monkeynut: @lanmower ... if it is properly loaded, it shouldn't be any differetn
13:32  monkeynut: @muszek ... .append();
13:32  lanmower: my ajax load does an .ajax and then a replacewith with the html that it received.
13:33  monkeynut: @lanmower ... ok, but have you considered receiving html and the jquery libs seperately?
13:33  xeen: monkeynut: I think muszek wants .add()
13:34  muszek: monkeynut: I don't want to add a new html, I want to add a new element to the list of selected elems... something like $('#foo').addElement('#bar').click(function() { do_something });
13:34  xeen: muszek: $('#foo').add('#bar') would match two elemnts, or you could do $('#foo, #bar')
13:34  muszek: so that do_something is done when I click on #foo or on #bar
13:34  monkeynut: @muszek ... I see, sorry , misunderstood ... what xeen said :)
13:34  lanmower: what I have is an html page that gets produced, it has a jquery import with <script> in it, without redesigning the framework that I'm using I dont think I can change that.
13:34  muszek: xeen, monkeynut thanks
13:34  philk__: whats more efficient: $('td:nth-child(1)', $('#' + data.catalogName)) or $('td:nth-child(1)', '#' )
13:34  monkeynut: niema problemo
13:35  philk__: whats more efficient: $('td:nth-child(1)', $('#' + data.catalogName)) or $('td:nth-child(1)', '#' + catalogName)
13:35  lanmower: plus every so often it produces extra imports for page specific jquery extensions.
13:35  monkeynut: @philk__ I think the latter is faster, you can always do a simple test ;)
13:37  lanmower: the question is, I've got jplayer running, it works fine, untill I do the ajax load and replace a page element with the produced html.
13:37  monkeynut: @lanmower ... in that case, once your html is loaded, the script will be fetched by the browser, shouldn't get problems from that (as long as the script tags are there and browser can access URL)
13:37  lanmower: the page element in question being the content area and sidebar of the page, esentially everything short of the layout.
13:37  lanmower: thing is, when my ajax load happens, some bindings disappear...
13:37  monkeynut: @lanmower ... I think I'd need to see your site, but i'm not sure i'll have time to chase down the error ... post a link and i'll give it a quick perusal though
13:37  mekwall: ohcibi, did you get it to work?
13:38  mekwall: ohcibi, had to help a coworker so was afk :P
13:38  lanmower: http://www.music2media.net/m2m/
13:38  lanmower: the first time you click a link it wont be ajax, still a bug I need to fix.
13:38  eightfold: philk__: so, what you are saying is i can't select stuff using "does not" logic?
13:39  monkeynut: @lanmower ... seems to be working fine for me ... you mean the links on the left hand side?
13:39  lanmower: it works fine, the player is happy, load the next page with ajax and the player keeps playing, you can stop and skip but the progress bar stops on the song...
13:39  lanmower: the playlist button also stops working.
13:40  toxz: how can i set the displayed text of an option element?
13:40  monkeynut: @lanmower ... also, if you click too fast you get a race condition and a blank page
13:40  toxz: option.text('bla'); is not working
13:40  lanmower: yeah working on that :)
13:40  monkeynut: @toxz  <option>mydisplayedtext</option>
13:40  toxz: @moneynut - i mean via an functio
13:40  toxz: n
13:41  thinced: Hi, Do you guys know any goot javascript templater to easily format my json data
13:41  monkeynut: @toxz  ...  $("myselect").find("someoption").html("my displayed text");
13:41  lanmower: I've been asked to implement a music player that keeps playing while you browse the site, but I'm having a very hard time implementing it.
13:41  henrikkok: thinced: google for jquery tmpl or consider "chain.js"
13:42  monkeynut: @lanmower ... yes, if the pages you ajax load are going to load libraries used by the player, they will be initialised and possibly screw some things up
13:42  thinced: I tried PURE but it's too simple when you need to do some action based buttons and such
13:42  monkeynut: are you sure you can't pull the javascript out of those pages and have them load in the main page at the start?
13:42  ravage: Could anyone help me out with this: I would like to show a ul when you mouseover a li in a different ul and keep it open if you mouseover the opened ul but if you don't, close the opened ul again... ayone any ideas?
13:42  lanmower: http://www.music2media.net/m2m/index.php?v=ajax&r=user is what ajax loads.
13:43  philk__: eightfold: what you mean "does not" logic?
13:43  monkeynut: @ravage ... post a site/code
13:43  toxz: @monkeynut: .html() for an option gives me a dom error
13:43  lanmower: now the question is: is there any way at all to make this work properly? am I beating a dead dog here?
13:44  monkeynut: @lanmower ... what does jquery.ba-bbq.js contain?
13:44  thinced: henrikkok: thanks I'll look into chain and tmpl
13:45  toxz: "I've been asked to implement a music player that keeps playing while you browse the site, but I'm having a very hard time implementing it." this is a very old task
13:45  toxz: an i can tell you thats not possible
13:45  lanmower: I'm guessing https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq
13:45  toxz: i used a frame for that years ago
13:45  lanmower: http://www.reverbnation.com/ does it with prototype.
13:46  henrikkok: Make a popup ?
13:46  toxz: the music player is in flash!?
13:46  monkeynut: @lanmower .... the page you load is a full html page ... but I can't see an iframe in your master page. That's sure to screw things up!
13:46  henrikkok: make a popup with the flash element?
13:47  monkeynut: @toxz ... don't get me started on bloody sites that start playing sounds automatically!
13:47  henrikkok: og use the good old frameset
13:47  henrikkok: everything else is uphill
13:48  monkeynut: @toxz ... html give you dom error? are you sure the option element exists? works for me ... perhaps try .text() instead (clutching at straws a little there)
13:48  toxz: tried both - strange - i think i used it before that way...
13:49  eightfold: philk__: sorry, having trouble finding suitable english words. i mean can target an element like this: "td.ItIsAName>a:empty" but if i only want to apply action if a is not empty i can't do that. might be better examples
13:49  monkeynut: @toxz, it's messy but you could try removing the element and replacing with a new one ..
13:49  mekwall: monkeynut, it might be just me, but your usage of @ and dots is quite irritating for the eye ;)
13:50  toxz: monkeynut - no i create the options - i do it now this way:  select.append($('<option>' + this + '</option>').attr('value', this));
13:50  monkeynut: mekwall     sorry, that's just my irc habits! I'll try to keep the ellipses down ;)
13:50  toxz: its ok
13:51  mekwall: monkeynut, no worries. I have my bad habits as well hehe... overuse of smileys for example
13:51  toxz: monkeynut - my irc client does not show updates with using @ before the name ;-)
13:51 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:51  lanmower: so the answer is while its possible with prototype, its impossible with jquery?
13:51  monkeynut: eightfold, wrap that selector with a not    td.ItIsAName>:not(a:empty)
13:52  toxz: lanmower - i dont think you will get this to work
13:52  toxz: the music cant be playing while loading a new page by the way
13:52  toxz: without using frames
13:52  monkeynut: toxz, perhaps that's why I have no friends ..... :P
13:52  monkeynut: my god it's a really hard habit to get out of!
13:52  lanmower: its frustrating when I'm looking at another site that does this successfully right now...
13:53  monkeynut: lanmower: then look closer at the difference between their site and yours, find out why it does work on theirs
13:53  toxz: lanmower - if you have a more deep understanding you would accept the fact that its not possible to play music when you load a fresh page
13:53  toxz: you can use frames
13:53  toxz: !
13:54  toxz: the only way
13:54  lanmower: toxz: www.reverbnation.com/#!/
13:54  henrikkok: lanmower: it is a waste of time and not very simple to do
13:54  toxz: they use ajax
13:54  ravage: Could aonyone help with this: http://pastie.org/1286917
13:54  mekwall: @monkeynut ... hey mate this can be quite hard to read ... especially when ....... you do it alot! ....
13:54  toxz: for changing the whole content
13:54  philk__: how do I highlight elements with fade in fade out of the hightlight?
13:55  lanmower: yesh I'm using ajax too, for changing the whole content as well.
13:55  toxz: this has nothing to do with the musicplayer
13:55  henrikkok: philk__:  you need jquery-ui or a more simple plugin.
13:55  lanmower: but when I change unrelated elements on my site, the music player breaks.
13:55  monkeynut: mekwall: I'm trying to me more friendly to other people's eyes, to me that was quite easy to read.  I use ellipses all the time, trying to get out of an old habit as we speak ;)
13:56  monkeynut: lanmower: ajax for changing the whole content doesn't make any sense
13:56  toxz: lanmower: then youre doing something wrong
13:56  monkeynut: lanmower: ajax is only for when you want to change part of the content
13:56  lanmower: clearly :)
13:56  mekwall: monkeynut, I use ellipsis when I'm grumpy and irritated at someone
13:56  toxz: but to change the content of your page u can use jquery
13:56  toxz: yes
13:56  toxz: :-d
13:57  toxz: :-D
13:57  mekwall: monkeynut, like this: use google...
13:57  ravage: Could anyone help with this?  http://pastie.org/1286917
13:57  mekwall: when stating the obvious so to say :D
13:57  monkeynut: mekwall, that makes it worse! I use ellipses for a pause for thought or seperation which is any longer than a full-stop in my head!
13:57  mekwall: monkeynut, haha! so you type what you think :)
13:58  mekwall: monkeynut, so ellipsis is like your loading bar hahahaha
13:58  lanmower: monkeynut: in this scenario it makes perfect sense.
13:58  lanmower: I need elements on the page to stay resident while others change, thats what ajax does.
13:58  lanmower: I'm not looking for an easy solution here, I'm looking for a possible solution.

13:58  monkeynut: mekwall et. al.  apologies for my non-standard punctuation habits :) ... and yes, I type while I think unless I have a reason to suspect my brain might not be right first time ;)
13:58  mekwall: monkeynut, ... wait ... you could do.... perhaps.... nah.... maybe ... this? ...... didn't work :(
13:59  monkeynut: mekwall, it's kind of like my loading bar, or a suggested loading bar for the intended reader.
13:59  monkeynut: LOL
13:59  compaq: ravage, there are lots of ways.  I never did it myself, but even in just css, there is "hidden" and :hover
13:59  lanmower: I'm using jquery to change the content of the page, my question is not if its possible or not here I have a working example somebody else made and my own incomplete example running, my question is what things can I try to make the music player not break when things change on the site.
13:59  compaq: ravage, in jquery, there are tons of applets that do that for you too, check out the applets at their site, or check out some dhtml page
13:59  eightfold: monkeynut: thanks. can i use this same logic if i want to select an element that does not contain a certain text string?
13:59  mekwall: ?stats
13:59  bot-t: #jquery IRC stats http://bot-t.com/logs/stats/jquery.html
13:59  monkeynut: lanmower: as I and others have said, use an iframe!!
14:00  mekwall: ouch :(
14:00  lanmower: would an iframe help in this scenario?
14:01  monkeynut: yes lanmower, the content which is the same for each page should be outside and then load the specific pages inside.  An alternative is to not use iframes and to modify the pages your are requesting.  Since you said you can't do that, you're stuck with iframes.
14:01  compaq: compaq, one way I know of, you can use remove() and html(), with onMouseOver, which will delete and re-add that
14:01  henrikkok: philk__: look at the $.effect() - there is an option called 'highlight' :-)
14:01  lanmower: do I then put the content in an iframe and edit the src attribute?
14:01  compaq: ravage, or, you can make two classes, one using the hidden from css, and one just regular, and then you can use toggleClass()
14:02  monkeynut: mekwall:  ah ha! ""monkeynut, well... better do it right from the beginning? :)"" so you were getting annoyed at me :P
14:02  philk__: henrikkok: I am using it... but it does not seem to fade in and out with a timeout of 1000ms
14:02  henrikkok: philk__: 1000ms should not be a problem. Does it work if you increase it ?
14:03 --- k1kng is now known as k1ng
14:03  ravage: the problem is once you leave the li that toggles it without going to the shown ul, the shown ul stays there, and it should close because otherwise it would close the next time you mouseover the toggle li
14:04  mekwall: monkeynut, unconsciously I guess
14:05  compaq: ravage, oh you tried it already eh.  There must be a way to do it with toggle too, but it might be easier just to use remove() and html() or append()
14:05  ravage: guess i'm just missing something :p
14:05  monkeynut: eightfold, you can't quite use the same logic AFAIK, because I don't think there's a selector for "contains this text", I think you would have to iterate over suspect elements and regex their contents, unless anyone here has a better idea (any other idea!)
14:05  mekwall: monkeynut, I use "well..." as a rebuke :P
14:06  compaq: ravage, remove is so easy.  You just give the items a class name, and then you do $(class-name).remove(), and its gone, there is clearUntil() also, but remove is easier
14:06  monkeynut: :'(
14:06  compaq: ravage, and append() is easy to , you just make block with div's, and then you append to it, so it will appear just below the div'
14:06  henrikkok: however .remove() is heavyduty for your browser - because of dom manipulation
14:07  compaq: ravage, so you would have append("you html code");
14:07  ravage: compaq, now i'm using slideUp and slideDown on the ul that is to be shown, i would like it to animate in you see
14:07 --- sozi is now known as Lindrian
14:08  henrikkok: ravage:  using .remove() and .append() should be your last choice. It will punish your users.
14:08  compaq: ravage, yeah, for sure, I think you should check out the applets already made, cause they use a few algorithms together, that make the animation as smooth as possible
14:08  xotix: hi
14:08  xotix: how can i make a download with jquery?
14:08  ravage: compaq, ok, i'll look around a bit more :)
14:09  compaq: ravage, I will find you one, 1min
14:09  philk__: Inside the queded function can I find out if there are more elements in the queue? I am doing a elem.queue(function(next) { if (0 === elem.queue()) {} }) but this never is called
14:09  compaq: ravage, I am gonna find one on dynamicdrive

14:22  mekwall: Phrogz, this is not aimed at you but since you mentioned the selector I'll share my thought to get your comment on it.  :text and the other input-specific selectors doesn't make much sense that they select * per default and thus must add input

14:29  mekwall: Phrogz_, perhaps doesn't make sense if  you look at selectors in general... but considering that jQuery is "write less, do more" then it doesn't make sense as it's currently working
14:29  doonie: sizzle != jq though ;>
14:30  mekwall: doonie, you agree with my opinion about the type-shortcut selectors? :)
14:30  doonie: yea i somehow see :text as input only
14:30  Phrogz_: doonie: Does sizzle provide :text, or jQuery?
14:30  doonie: though I write input:text ;D
14:30 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 131 seconds
14:30  mekwall: Phrogz_, well... if you really need to select all elements... why not add *:text ? :D
14:30  doonie: Phrogz_ sizzle probably
14:31  mekwall: Phrogz_, better overriding the default element then having to add input everytime
14:31  Graloth: I can't seem to find an answer i understand for this: I need to submit a form that is inside an iframe, i've tried to get it working with ajax, but i know too little about that to make it work. Does jquery allow me to target the form inside the iframe and submit it, or do i need a plugin for that?
14:31  mekwall: The docs state "the bare $(':text') is equivalent to $('*:text'), so $('input:text') should be used instead"
14:31  mekwall: so why it doesn't do that by default is beyond me
14:32  doonie: so that one can use type text on other elements? ;X
14:32  mekwall: doonie, it's really only used on inputs. a guess, 99% of the time
14:32  Phrogz_: mekwall: Perhaps it is a limitation in sizzle that any pseudo-selector cannot further filter by element (total guess, likely wrong)
14:32  doonie: not sure why one would heh
14:33  mekwall: doonie, that's why I'm wondering... it should be a shortcut, but it kinda falls flat when you have to add input to begin with :D

15:01  thyphus: is it possible to check a var like if($var like "bar") if $var="foobar";?
15:01  henrikkok: like a simple if statement ?
15:02  thyphus: no...
15:02  thyphus: $var="foobar"; if($var like "bar"){}
15:02  thyphus: is there a "like"-condition?
15:02  mekwall: Phrogz_, suggested change could be return (("input" === elem.nodeName) && ("text" === elem.type));
15:02  henrikkok: no "like" is not a correct identifier
15:02  thyphus: or identifier ;)
15:02  henrikkok: you should use: ===
15:02  thyphus: ah, ok
15:02  monkeynut: typhyus, do you want to check if they have a similar type or if their text contents is similar?
15:02  thyphus: thanks :)
15:02  thyphus: monkeynut: need to check if their text contents is similar
15:03  mekwall: Phrogz_, :input filter is actually checking nodeName so it might not be that stupid :)
15:04  monkeynut: === will be true if they are *exactly* the same, you may want to use regex or similar to see if the substring is contained
15:04  henrikkok: thyphus: then you need to work with the standard regular expressions. you could use .test()
15:04  monkeynut: that was to thyphus
15:04  xeen: thyphus: If you're wanting your example to evaluate true then maybe a regex if ($var.match(/bar$/)) is best?
15:04  xeen: Also.. no need for the $ sign
15:05  thyphus: ahh. thanks :)
15:05  xeen: Although, I guess var = "foobar" would be invalid?
15:05  henrikkok: xeen: match will return an array. test() will return boolean
15:05  xeen: var something = "foobar";
15:05  thyphus: that was just an example
15:05  monkeynut: thyphus, henrikkok: indexOf and the substring should be faster
15:05  henrikkok: monkeynut: true!
15:06  xeen: henrikkok: test() sorry, thyphus: use test().
15:07  thyphus: ok :)=
15:07  thyphus: hm
15:13  thyphus: http://pastebin.com/Gy88RevJ what is wrong?
15:13  monkeynut: on line 5, remove the quotes
15:13  monkeynut: (in the if statement) so you are supplying a regex object
15:14  xeen: There's the $ on act too, line 5
15:14  xeen: var act="something", means the variable name is 'act'. You don't use $s to denote a variable in JS thyphus
15:14  monkeynut: he he, so there is. being doing php too thyphus?
15:14  thyphus: ah ok
15:14  jeffsmykil: anyone see a glaring error in this that I'm not: http://pastebin.com/yE9nj7w3

15:15  ChristW: Anyone here with inside knowlege of the 'validate' plugin? It seems that remote validation kill local validation...
15:15  monkeynut: jeffsmykil, there's no error there I can see, are you sure the element is there and jquery is loaded?
15:16  jeffsmykil: yeah the other scripts are working
15:16  thyphus: so this should work? http://pastebin.com/z4Lmmf73

15:17  monkeynut: thyphus, I think line 5 is stil wrong
15:17  xeen: thyphus: With /^value/, are you looking for the string to actualy start with "value", OR.. are you wanting to evaluate the value variable in the matching?
15:17  monkeynut: thyphus, personally I would do  if( act.indexOf(value) )
15:18  monkeynut: also, take note of what xeen just said
15:18  monkeynut: but since you said you wanted to find it in there, the solution I gave should work fine for you, no need for a regex object
15:19  monkeynut: other problem is, the regex you gave will match text starting with the string 'value' :P
15:19  thyphus: xeen: just want to check if act starts with value
15:19  monkeynut: would need to construct the regex first ... just use indexOf ;)

15:22  jeffsmykil: both search and login
15:22  thyphus: hm... sth is wrong
15:22  jeffsmykil: monkeynut: both #search and #login
15:22  monkeynut: jeffsmykil, I would set this in the css instead.
15:23  jeffsmykil: oh
15:23  jeffsmykil: thats not a bad idea
15:23  jeffsmykil: but just for shits and giggles
15:23  jeffsmykil: whats wrong with it now
15:23  Gelegrod1n: with .data() how do i select a child element at once? .data("blabla.sub"); isnt working
15:23  monkeynut: jeffsmykill, it would be better if you did $('#search,#login').hide(); in future ... much faster ;)
15:23  aws: BEER TIME
15:24  jeffsmykil: monkeynut: I would if it worked ;)
15:24  jeffsmykil: but display:none is working
15:24  jeffsmykil: but kind of frustrated i couldnt figure it out
15:25  monkeynut: I can't see anything immediately wrong, but I do see over-use of splitting up script ;)
15:25  thyphus: monkeynut: act.test() should be value.test() ;)
15:25  Donli: Hello everyone. I want to implement a igoogle like page. Any suggestions on how to do that use jquery?
15:26  monkeynut: thyphus .hide() will just toggle the display:none css property

15:27  toxz: if i define an eventhandler as a function of an object - how can i access the current object? if i use this i get the object, which the event fired
15:27  monkeynut: Donli, that's a very very open question ... first suggestion would be to look at the code for iGoogle :P
15:27  thyphus: monkeynut: why hide? my problem is, that i have a input-field and a select-list... and if i type sth in the input, it will be selected in the list
15:27  monkeynut: jeffsmykil, I'm a coder, I can make anything work eventually but I can't make anything look pretty!
15:28  jeffsmykil: monkeynut: i feel your pain sir, and thank you for your help

15:30  Donli: monkeynut , thanks for suggestions. Can I start with this example? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets
15:31  ChristW: Could someone take a look at the code for jquery.validate.js (line 948) and tell me that it is correct? Because the way I see it, it kills local validation...
15:31  Phrogz_: toxz: Use a closure.
15:31  monkeynut: just checking the link, Donli
15:32  thyphus: monkeynut: no idea why its not working?
15:32  alexw23: Hi al,,
15:32  alexw23: Hi all,*
15:32  monkeynut: ahhh, now I see the sense in which you mean 'like iGoogle', I would recommend using draggable and droppable with targets, the info in the docs should be plenty to get you started, lots of nice examples too
15:32  toxz: my jquery.validate.js has only 0 lines length
15:33  monkeynut: sorry thyphus, can't see off hand.  You can write console.log('some text or whatever'); in any code block to see if and when it fires and try to troubleshoot if you feel up to it.
15:33  alexw23: What is the best way to parse actions sent to the client-side via ajax (JSON), i.e. I want to send 'action'=>array('hide'=>'.class'); or  'action'=>array('append'=>array('.class'=>'ddddd'));
15:34  alexw23: Has anybody has experience with this
15:35  alexw23: My code so far is: http://jsfiddle.net/Chrpu/
15:35  monkeynut: alexw23, i'm not too clear what you're trying to do, or how it's related to jquery. I usually have some structure like xml, maybe an <instruction> tag and then when the client receives that page they look for instructions and execute them
15:35  alexw23: Just seems like it's getting messy
15:35  Donli: Thanks monkeynut. I start from the docs. Will come back when I have problems. Thanks again.
15:36  monkeynut: no problems Donli, see you soon ;)
15:36  alexw23: monkey nut, basically I am trying to send commands to the client, i.e. I click a button, so I want to hide this button and show another
15:36  philk__: is there any jquery profiling plugin available? I have searched but only found dead links
15:36  alexw23: Keeps everything server side then
15:36  monkeynut: I see alexw23, I initially thought you were talking about a client-server exchange
15:36  Jonz: alexw23, you're trying to create a generic method for manipulating the DOM via  a server-side scripting language?
15:37  alexw23: Yeah preety much, saves the hassle of having to write up thousand lines of client-side javascript
15:37  alexw23: I.e. I add a comment so
15:37  monkeynut: alexw23, you can't really keep *everything* server side, it's best design to do client-side (browser) stuff client-side and server stuff server-side!
15:37  alexw23: append '.comments' and html
15:38  alexw23: Yeah I get what you mean, just trying to keep effort minimal
15:40  toxz: can i pass a var to an event handler?
15:42  Pepr: Morning everyone. Quick question. Is there a safe and accepted way to create your own namespace in jQuery.
15:43  monkeynut: I don't think there's a way toxz, I think you have to use one of the common methods. For example, have the data associated with the element the event is bound to, or use a global variable
15:43  toxz: monkeynut - a i have it
15:43  monkeynut: really? how did you do that?!
15:43  toxz: in ?bind i can pass data
15:43  toxz: ? bind()
15:43  bot-t: .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
15:44  toxz: eventDataA map of data that will be passed to the event handler.
15:44  monkeynut: toxz, I didn't think it worked that way, I thought the data available was the event object. Off to look at docs again
15:45  eirikb: Hello. Why does the plugin example here use this.each? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#The_Basics I thought the selector would run the plugin on each found element?
15:45  Pepr: The selector just returns the array of finds, $.each loops through them
15:46  thyphus: monkeynut: what does indexOf()? i dont find sth via google
15:46  toxz: monkeynut - but how can i access the passed data then?
15:47  eirikb: Pepr: So this should not work, or? http://jsfiddle.net/fbKqw/
15:47  monkeynut: thyphus: first hit google "javascript indexOf" ... http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_IndexOf.asp
15:47  thyphus: ah, javascript. ok ;)
15:47  thyphus: was searching for "jquery indexof"
15:47  Pepr: eirikb: think of it like sql in a sorts. $('.classtofind') returns the rows ( or list of all the elements that have that class. $.('.classtofind').each(function()... ) now tacks a function or command to each of these.
15:48  monkeynut: toxz , apparently you use event.data
15:48  henrikkok: thyphus:  remember that the function does not return a boolean but an int. så −1 is false
15:48  monkeynut: toxz, example is 1/3 way down the doc page
15:48  thyphus: henrikkok: yes, seen that 30s ago :D
15:48  eirikb: Pepr: Yes, but why do I need to run a this.each in my plugin when it would work anyway (as in my example)?
15:49  Pepr: good point.
15:49  toxz: monkeynut - ahh thx - i was looking on the ? change() page - there wasnt such example
15:49  toxz: ? change()

15:50  jherdman: is there an easy way to inspect data posted by jquery ajax requests?
15:50  monkeynut: thyphus, just do  if( haystack.indexOf( needle ) > 0 )
15:50  Graloth: anyone who has time to help me with this? i cannot get the form inside an iframe to be submitted in the same function as the iframe is created (http://pastebin.com/rc2AzBr5) please help
15:51  henrikkok: jherdman:  firebug
15:51  jherdman: henrikkok: that's what i thought too. i'm not seeing data posted since i moved to jQuery 1.4.3
15:52  monkeynut: jherdman, you may want to get some of the firebug plugins to make the data easier to parse, I personally prefer to use burp proxy
15:52  Pepr: eirikb: As a matter of fact your example makes the .each redundant if your plugin is simply dealing with the element in the selector. If you want to play with it's childern then $.each becomes handy. Yet you could also use some crafty selector language to get that as well.
15:52  jherdman: monkeynut: i'll give that a  shot. thanks!
15:52  henrikkok: jherdman: might sound stupid, but are you sure that the call gets executed? i haven't had any problems with firebug and 1.4.3
15:53  thyphus: monkeynut: but i want then to select the matched value in my select/list
15:53  eirikb: Pepr: Oh so it's the children
15:53  monkeynut: jherdman, no problem. remember to configure the proxy in your browser to, I use proxyswitcher to I can turn it on and off with a click
15:53  jherdman: henrikkok: yeah. the server responds, but i'm not seeing the params i'm sending from the page
15:54  thyphus: monkeynut: act.split(" "); for(var i in act){ if(value == act[i]){ true } }
15:54  thyphus: sth like that?
15:54  henrikkok: jherdman: did you enable Show XMLHttpRequests in the console?
15:54  thyphus: or is there a easier way?
15:54  Pepr: erikib: Yep, and more complex DOM playing if your plugin requires to use other nodes in relation to the one your selector has selected.
15:55  jherdman: henrikkok: yup
15:55  eirikb: Pepr: What do you mean by "in relation"?
15:55  henrikkok: jherdman: sometimes firebug goes nut on me - and i restart the browser app.
15:56  monkeynut: typhus, value == act[i] will be true if act[i] is the same as value. The expression I gave will be true if value is contained in act[i]. That should be the only difference

15:56  ericinohio: I have a table where each row repesents properties of an object.  Is here a way I can store the object as json in each row hidden so I can compare it to another object later to see if anything changed without using a bunch of hidden fields
15:56  delfis: show.image.php returns an image, when i make <img src="show.image.php" it works ok, but when i get it with ajax, how to show that image? because i get binnary code
15:56  ericinohio: er..each col representrs properties...
15:57  delfis: its withouth jquery, if you could help me
15:57  delfis: :?
15:57  monkeynut: delfis, the easiest way is to just dynamically change the src attribute of your img tag
15:57  delfis: but then img is not refreshing
15:58  monkeynut: delfis, it will refresh, every time you change the src attribute it will show the new image. Or you can add a whole new image tag.
15:58  eirikb: Pepr: Well I guess I don't need it if it works for me
15:58  eirikb: Pepr: I was just afraid I had to do it
15:58  Pepr: eirikb: Lets say you are selecting one type of node, and you need to select other types of nodes to get properties from them to assist in your plugins functionality. You would need the $.each command chaining $('.classtofind') could prove to be problematic. I use $.each more to iterate through arrays and nodes when I need my plugin to get other data from other DOM elements on the page.
15:59  delfis: but then i don`t need ajax, do i? :?
15:59  monkeynut: delfis, if it's not working, post the code and i'll see if I can tell why it's not working
15:59  monkeynut: and no, sounds like you don't really need 'ajax'
16:00  eirikb: Pepr: Thanks
16:00  monkeynut: although, technically changing a src attribute is still kind of ajax without the x, as is a whole load of other stuff called 'ajax'. It's just a buzzword really
16:00  delfis: but my task is to use ajax to change data with browser and ph

16:03  monkeynut: delfis, I still don't mind helping

16:04  delfis: ok i understand
16:04  jaql: i can make what i want to do work by simply duplicating all of the code twice, but that's not very nice
16:04  monkeynut: so, you want to dynamically load an image, meaning, you want an image to change/appear when a user does something?
16:04  delfis: thank you
16:04  delfis: yes
16:05 --- frigginSmoke is now known as seutje
16:05  monkeynut: ok delfis, then you need to use an 'event handler'.  say you want to cange an image when a user clicks a div.  put onchange='//js commands to change img src' in that div.  Or you jquery, it's much nicer but it's big if that's all you're going to use it for

16:12  jaql: monkeynut: heh :\
16:13  monkeynut: thyphus, provide a callback function, e.g.  .change( function() { setTimeout( //whatever to do here, X);  } );
16:13  monkeynut: thyphus, actually I don't think you want to use .change at all
16:14  monkeynut: .change will only fire once the user has lost focus (and if the contents have changed), it will never fire while the user is still focussed in that area
16:14  thyphus: monkeynut
16:14  thyphus: oops...
16:15  thyphus: monkeynut: yes, i noticed that...
16:15  monkeynut: thyphus, what you really want to do is to bind a .keyPress event and create the timer (save it to a variable with var= ) if there is a subsequent keyPress, cancel the timer and set a new on. Then it will only fire when it's waited for the timeout
16:15  thyphus: ah ok.. good idea :)

16:25  monkeynut: any problems, give me a shout. You only need the top 8 lines, you can turn it into a function easily too. remember if you call it in a function, each time you will bind another click handler, ending up with loads, unless you use .die to kill the old one.  It's often better to use .live in these cases
16:25  jaql: monkeynut: okay

16:29  monkeynut: thyphus, I would have line 8 having   > 0 instead of > 1 .  That code will do the following: for each word in text (element of act), check if the word contains the string in value, if it does replace the html in #info with the original plus the word the match was found in.  Is that what you want?
16:31  thyphus: monkeynut: right
16:31  thyphus: monkeynut: #info is just to test...
16:31  thyphus: monkeynut: but the function is not called :(
16:33  monkeynut: vispillo ... i've found a couple of issues.
16:33  eightfold: is this looking right: $('.TopMenuToolsList > li:first-child:empty').parent().parent().hide();     ?
16:33  vispillo: okay
16:34  monkeynut: vispillo: I think the offending one producing the error is head.removeChild( script );  it will be looking for an object like that, you need to put quotes around it so it looks for a tag name
16:34  eightfold: if the first-child of .TopMenuToolsList is empty i want to hide element two levels up
16:35  vispillo: monkeynut: but that's being called somewhere inside jquery to clean up the script tag inserted for jsonp, right?
16:35 --- Killswitch__ is now known as Killswitch
16:36  eightfold: or is this better: $('.TopMenuToolsList:first-child:empty').parent().parent().hide();
16:36  vispillo: as i'm not actively removing any elements myself
16:36  monkeynut: vispillo, not sure, just looking at all the code. It's on line 5556 of some file or other ;)
16:36  vispillo: yup, the bits round it looked like jsonp stuff
16:37  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/s2K2x/ <--- I think it's stupid that the jQuery object doesn't return head and body :(
16:38  monkeynut: vispillo, the only other thing I can suggest is to check there are no invalid characters in the extremely lond src string.  If that's fine, it's probably a bug in the lib unless anyone else has better ideas.
16:38  vispillo: okay, i'll keep looking then, thanks!
16:39  toxz: how can i select an element with a specific attribute - <input NAME="xyz" />   ???
16:39  monkeynut: np vispillo, if you find more clues you can always ping me again
16:39  kasu300: is there any known cases where $.ajax ignores certain values in the data property (if it's an object) ?
16:40  thyphus: monkeynut: why does my setTimeout() will not call my function? http://pastebin.com/GnW9iqmw
16:40  thyphus: i dont get it :x
16:41  thyphus: even if i say setTimeout("changeUser()",300);
16:45  monkeynut: thyphus, you have declared the timer variable in the function, it is destroyed when you exit that function
16:46  thyphus: aha...
16:46  thyphus: but it works with setTimeout(changeUser, 300); :)
16:46  Phrogz: monkeynut: Line 23 assigns a global 'timeout' variable, not local.
16:46  eightfold: how do i do the selector: if the first child of a div is empty
16:47  thyphus: another problem... if i type sth in my input, nothing happens. if i type in a further char, the function is called with the value before...
16:47  monkeynut: thyphus, that's the second thing I was getting to ... when you add the brackets it evaluates the function, so you were giving a null return value to setimeout
16:47  Phrogz: eightfold: 'empty' == no text content?
16:47  eightfold: Phrogz: seems right: #TopMenuToolsList:first-child:empty ?
16:47  Phrogz: eightfold: No, #foo > *:first-child:empty
16:47  thyphus: Phrogz: i've declared the var at the top of my code.. :)
16:48  Phrogz: thyphus: Even better, then changeUserS is a closure over it.
16:48  jaql: monkeynut: with the help of you and ericinohio, this works -- http://pastebin.com/385Sq85x -- but i am confused as to how i'd turn that into a function that i could have automatically run for each checkbox/fieldset i want to do this to :x
16:48  Phrogz: monkeynut: But when you supply a string to setTimeout, it is as though you are calling  new Function(str)  so it isn't evaluated immediately.
16:49  jaql: monkeynut: i needed to use .find() because the input and select fields are nested inside of the fieldset elements
16:49  monkeynut: jaql, exactly like you did before. put it in a function def with 2 parms ... i'll do it on pastebin
16:50  jaql: oh that'll work this time?
16:51  monkeynut: i've updated it http://pastebin.com/gRMce3cj
16:51  jaql: monkeynut: oh wow it does work this time
16:51  monkeynut: magic :)
16:51  ohcibi: is jquery closing html tags, that i add with .append() ?
16:51  alaing_away: Jquery ui autocomple : i how can i search multiple words?
16:52  jaql: monkeynut: thanks for your help by the way
16:53  monkeynut: np jaql, just make sure you only call that function once for each pair of selectors, or put .die('click') in line 5
16:53  monkeynut: ohcibi, you should supply valid html to .append
16:54  airwater: what are is the webdesign trend of today somebody got some pictures or tutorials??? or blogs sites whateever
16:54  ohcibi: monkeynut: so if i append nested elements, i have to add them step by step?
16:54  ablomen: airwater, <blink/> and framesets
16:55  ablomen: airwater, there are lots of (web)design related blogs and sites, use google to find them :)
16:55  alaing_away: Jquery ui autocomple : i how can i search multiple words? eg. i want to search for "John Smith" but when I type "John Sm" with a space it only returns all Johns.
16:55  monkeynut: ohcibi: you can add them step by step or write in all the nested html and add it at once (which is faster)
16:56  Hopsy: haii JJMalina
16:56  eightfold: Phrogz: oh, thank you
16:56  monkeynut: ohcibi: $('mything').append('<div><div></div><div><span></span></div></div>');
16:57  Phrogz: eightfold: You're welcome.
16:57  ohcibi: monkeynut: i know what you mean, my string is a bit longer, but i concetenated each line now
16:58  monkeynut: cool ohcibi, I know it's not the prettiest, but it is fast, and can be manageable with good code formatting
16:58  toxz: can i append an array of elements to an element?
16:59  monkeynut: toxz, you mean have an array as an element of another array? yes you can.
16:59  toxz: no
17:00  toxz: i have an array of option elements and want to append them to a select element at once
17:00  monkeynut: ah, I see. How are these option elements stored? if you chuck code on pastebin im sure I could show you the couple of lines you'd need
17:01  ajpiano: monkeynut: rememer that dude from yesterday
17:01  ajpiano: with the magic jack
17:01  monkeynut: typically you can do $('myselect').empty().append( array );
17:01  toxz: monkeynut: http://pastie.org/1287324
17:01  monkeynut: nice, gimme a sec toxz
17:02  LSU_JBob: Anyone see that jquery plugin where it's only purpose is to crash ie6?
17:03  toxz: monkeynut - line 8 is not working btw
17:04  monkeynut: toxz, I would replace lines 7 & 8 with $(options).each( function(){ select.append(this); } );
17:04  toxz: hehe
17:04  toxz: yeah
17:04  toxz: i was searching for a way to append an array at once
17:04  toxz: but maybe theres no such option
17:04  toxz: thx
17:04  monkeynut: toxz, well, I say I would, but really I would make options a string and concatenate instead of push, will be much faster, and you can add them all at once
17:05  alaing_away: hi just been reading up on templating can you place your templates into external files to be cached?

17:12  vispillo: hm. apparently the script tag is already being removed, but then jQuery tries to do it again for some reason, and obviously fails. weird.
17:12  monkeynut: If you're marty McFly, you can find out ;)
17:13  McFly_: I'm not ;-)
17:13  alaing_away: hi just been reading up on templating can you place your templates into external files to be cached?
17:13  ajpiano: McFly_: by the end of the week, most likely
17:13  monkeynut: so no time-traveling car then? just have to rely on release sched.
17:14  McFly_: alright, thanks!
17:14  ajpiano: McFly_, there shoudl be 1 final short RC today or tomorrow
17:14  ajpiano: so keep an eye out for that

17:19  monkeynut: what's up ajpiano?
17:19  johnf__: but I want it global
17:20  ajpiano: arrays are NOT associative in javascript
17:20  monkeynut: if you want it global, declare it outside the rest of your functions
17:20  ajpiano: you should NOT use array["key"]
17:20  monkeynut: ajpiano, works for me
17:20  ajpiano: it's horribly broken
17:20  johnf__: ok
17:20  ajpiano: and totally wrong
17:20  ajpiano: i promise you monkeynut

17:20  bot-t: johnf__, Literals - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Literals
17:20  monkeynut: ajpiano, when can it be a problem? it's never been a problem in my code before!
17:21  ajpiano: monkeynut, if ppl add to array.prototype, it breaks
17:21  ajpiano: it's just wrong

17:23  ajpiano: it's so horribly bad that i could not in good conscience allow johnf__ to think it was a good idea

17:27  danheberden: monkeynut: if it was a better way to go, you'd see var option = []; option['click'] = function() {}; $('li').myCoolPlugin( option );
17:27  danheberden: but you don't, you see bad-ass objects - like $('li').myCoolPlugin({ whoa: "yup, its bitchin", youSure: "im always sure" });

17:28  jherdman: folks who use Rails... how are you sending an array in JSON to your server? e.g. i want params[:foo] to be [1, 2, 3, 4]?
17:28  monkeynut: meh, i've skimmed that article.  So basically there's not much point starting off with an array, just an arbitrary object will suffice. Good practice, but not a diabolical problem in my normal use and not a problem for what the asker was asking. i'll bear it in mind, but it doesn't seem bad enough to want to change my existing code.
17:28  ajpiano: dude
17:28  ajpiano: it's a problem
17:29  Rorosha: which do you think would be faster: pulling the whole of the dataset unsorted from the db and sorting it with jQuery browserside for display, or running sort on the db and then returning that and displaying the presorted data?
17:29  ajpiano: did you read http://andrewdupont.net/2006/05/18/javascript-associative-arrays-considered-harmful/ as well ?
17:29  danheberden: "even though it's horible practice, i think i'll keep coding that way"
17:29  ajpiano: monkeynut, it's fine to like, not go back and change your code if it's not broken, but we like to give out the right answers here
17:30  monkeynut: danheberden, didn't say i'd keep doing it that way, just not going to bother changing my working code, I know it doesn't suffer these problems
17:31  danheberden: ya, cool - just wanted to bully ya :p
17:31  ajpiano: vispillo, can you try against the latest jquery 1.4.3 rc
17:31  monkeynut: however, yes, I will tell people to use arbitrary objects instead of the array object in future, just in case
17:31  ajpiano: wewt
17:31  ajpiano: monkeynut it's cool, everything i learnt about javascript i learnt by not knowing it first :)
17:31  vispillo: ajpiano: hm, is that the one straight from git?
17:31  ajpiano: vispillo: at this particular moment in time, yes
17:32  kelster75: hi guys. question, what are "arbitrary objects"? I call those object literals...
17:32  vispillo: tried, that, didn't help
17:32  ajpiano: the one straight from git would be equal to the 1.4.3rc
17:32  kelster75: just wondering if we are talking about the same thing
17:32  ajpiano: kelster75, we are

17:33  ajpiano: vispillo, what issue are you having with script tags
17:33  danheberden: kelster75: arbitrary: based on or subject to individual discretion or preference or sometimes impulse or caprice;
17:33  danheberden: so ya, just object's 'n arrays
17:34  vispillo: ajpiano: as far as I can see, after a jsonp request, it tries to delete the script tag it included twice. hold on, i've got an example online
17:34  danheberden: the 'object literal' is the full declaration with key/value pairs - like { zomg: "what what" }
17:34  kelster75: right, I've never thought of them as arbitrary, but that works for me too.
17:34  ajpiano: vispillo: hmm interesting, cause there was a bug fixed about that it wasn't deleting it properly
17:34  danheberden: kelster75: you are correct, they are not arbitrary only in the sense you use your discression to actually use them :p
17:34  danheberden: ( it was a made up term )

17:37  spleeze123: Hey guys. I am using the jQ Validate plugin, and while rules seem to be assignable by class <input name="abc123" type="text" class="email"> with "rules: {email:...}", it seems messages need to be assigned to specific field names. So that input would have to be name="email" to get the "messages: {email:...}". What am I missing here? Why should I need to couple validation to my fieldnames?
17:38  monkeynut: spleeze123, how will validation know which fields obey which rules without the coupling?
17:39  spleeze123: monkeynut, based simply on their class, no?  If a field has class "email" it should take the rules for "email", as well as the message for "email".
17:39  Thomas`-: would anyone be able to show me an example of how to pass an integer to the click callback ?
17:40  spleeze123: monkeynut, What if I have a form with 100 email fields. If they all have class "email", then no problem, but if I have to start tracking their field names (which have to be unique) then wouldn't that be a negative thing?
17:41  ajpiano: vispillo: i think it's actually a known issue
17:41  vispillo: oh
17:41  monkeynut: Thomas`-  $('thing').bind('click', {myint: intval}, function(evt){ evt.data.myint });
17:42  Thomas`-: monkeynut  thank you
17:42  monkeynut: spleeze123, I don't understand the problem, field names are not the same as the class.
17:42  monkeynut: np Thomas`-
17:43  ajpiano: vispillo: yeah, we got that .  it's not going to be in for 1.4.4 though
17:43  vispillo: ah, okay. wasn't getting very far with the fiddle anyway :]

20:15  Michael: e.g. observing a change in a variable inside the iframe
20:16  Michael:  An iframe calling a parent frame would be an XSS security risk
20:16  Harris: micheal, how would i setup a close link on my box $('#sub').live('click', function(){

20:22  Harris: since
20:22  Harris: $('#sub').live('click', function(){
20:22  Harris: works
20:22  So_High: oh. Ok, sweet, that will work
20:23  dub54: how comes this doesn't post properly if return is set to true, but when I set return false it works fine.. http://pastebin.com/pt8HjedB
20:24 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 131 seconds
20:24  ajpiano: cause if you return true it lets the native submit happen and does a page navigation
20:24  ajpiano: return false calls see ?preventdefault
20:24  bot-t: event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
20:24  dub54: i wan't the form submit to trigger after the ajax request is made
20:25  Harris: $('#sub').live('click', function () { $('#dialog').hide{
20:25  ajpiano: oh god, this again
20:25  Harris: dont work either
20:25  Harris: heh
20:25  ajpiano: dub54: you have to use the ajax callback if you want to do somethihng after the ajax is done
20:25  dub54: so put return true in the callback?
20:25  ajpiano: Harris: do you have mroe than one element with the id #sub
20:25  ajpiano: no
20:26  ajpiano: you then need to re-trigger submit and put a flag so at that point it doesn't cal the ajax
20:26  Harris: ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/MPPHSnJx current working code
20:26  ajpiano: that's not the answer to my question now is it
20:26  Harris: erm
20:26  Harris: no
20:27  Harris: just want to make a button to close the box heh
20:27  ajpiano: you know bout like
20:27  ajpiano: $("#dialog").dialog("close") right?
20:28  Harris: im really new so no
20:28  Harris: lol
20:28  ajpiano: are you using the jquery ui dialog
20:28  Harris: nope
20:29  ajpiano: oh
20:29  ajpiano: k
20:29  ajpiano: then yeah
20:29  ajpiano: just remove the damn thing
20:29  dub54: ajpiano: understand you, within the callback do $('form').trigger('submit'), but how do I let the code know not to run the javascript again?
20:29  ajpiano: unless you don't want to remove it but rather hide it
20:29  ajpiano: dub54: you could pass some data along with the event when you trigger it
20:29  Harris: yea but ajpiano how would i make that into a button form, e.g to close (sorry for q's) lol
20:31  ajpiano: $("#somebutton").click(function(e) {  $("#somelement").remove();  })
20:31  linoj: hiya, probably OT but trying to find an answer, how do you get a non-modal dialog window to force a refresh on the window that launched it?
20:31  Harris: so i can place  $("#somebutton").click(function(e) {  $("#somelement").remove();  })
20:31  Harris: anywhere within

20:42  vector_xyz: hey guys i started to use HTML5's data-something="something" how can i bind an event in jquery to that $("data-action[value="apple"]).click.....
20:42  vector_xyz: im not sure what to use in the $("")
20:43  So_High: damit, still can't figure this out. It will not work as an array because each item of each category of each page of each type needs its own number and it has to be the next one in line for its type... anyways, why do you this this isn't working?          for ( var i = 0; i < filters.length; ++i )     {         var filter = filters[i]; 		NI_1_[filter] = 2; }    		 		
20:43  ajpiano: $("[data-action='apple']") like any other attrbute selector, vector_xyz
20:44  So_High: I need to initalize every var as being equal to 2 so it can be called for in another area of my script
20:45  vector_xyz: do u think it will be a problem instead of binding click events to ids and classes to use...
20:45  vector_xyz:  $("[data-action='book-it']").live('click', function() {....
20:47  ajpiano: having a raw attribute selector isn't the most performant thing in the world, it would nice if you could add an element
20:52  So_High: One last time just to make sure cuz google isn't coming up with anything. You can't create a variable name using variables?
20:52  ajpiano: So_High, you can
20:52  ajpiano: So_High,the same way that you are creating dynamic key names in the object
20:52  ajpiano: you can create dynamic keynames in the window object :p
20:52  So_High: oh!
20:53  ajpiano: window["N1_"+foo+"_"+bar] = "baz";
20:53  robokop: w00t lets create unreadable code:)
20:53  So_High: goddamn, alright so thats where your $.each(arr,function comes into play
20:53  ajpiano: yep
20:53  ajpiano: i was just saying that if you have a bunch of vars prefixed with the same code
20:53  ajpiano: what you want is really an object with a name, and then keys in it that reflect the different.ness
20:54  l4rk: use keys to create variables is not making unreadable code
20:54  So_High: what is windo in that example?
20:54  ajpiano: window is WINDOW
20:54  ajpiano: it's the WINDOW object
20:54  ajpiano: the same as the global scope
20:54  So_High: k
20:56  swiggy: anyone use jquery UI tabs?
20:57  So_High: omg wait, lol, can you ++ with an array??  NI_1[1]++?
20:57  meowsus: So, i've built a form and validated it with Javascript to return errors when someone hasn't completed all the input[type=text] fields correctly. Problem is when i make the form multipart/form-data and i include a input[type=file] in the form the onsubmit function stops working. The form always submits. How do i make it so that i can validate that someone has selected a file for upload?
20:58  So_High: change it from 2 to 3
20:58  So_High: lol, I'll check
20:58  So_High: sorry, I've got the giggles
20:58  ajpiano: So_High, if you want a variable containing a number to be incremented and be reflected at the same time in the variable, you have to prefix the ++ opreator

21:22  monkeynut: I believe as soon as an async xmlhttpreq object is made it will block js until it has completed
21:22  Aquaguy: doesnt seem to work
21:23  _c0deb3nder_: snover, does it support on all broswer
21:23  monkeynut: SwiftOne ... so dom update could still be around jquery library, then js processing gets blocked until req completes
21:23  snover: _c0deb3nder_: ask google
21:23  SwiftOne: But is the xhr object made prior to calling $.ajax()?
21:23  _c0deb3nder_: oh, i see only the latest...
21:23  monkeynut: SwiftOne, you can test this by using a 2 sec delay in between your dom update and the $.ajax
21:24  monkeynut: Aquaguy, when are you expecting it to change?

21:30 --- alexisabril_ is now known as alexisabril
21:30  SwiftOne: monkeynut, While I fight with jsfiddle to test this, I'm nonetheless confused.  Why would a xhr object be created before code execution hit the $.ajax() call?  Wouldn't that imply some level of parallel processing that get's all weird?  What if the async flag is based on data - how could it be evaluated until code execution hit the $.ajax() call?
21:32  meowsus: ... Okay... http://pastie.org/1288048 ... line 137 and 138 break the thing, and in firebug's console it says that that element is selected by $('.data select').
21:32  meowsus: but if you move those two lines above the select selector, everything works perfectly.
21:32  meowsus: Explain that, monkeybutt
21:32  meowsus: (ooooohhhh, buuuurrrnnn)
21:33  monkeynut: SwiftOne, don't get me wrong, that wasn't an authorative answer, it was a suggestion to test, i've seen funny looking races before. if a little timer sorts it out then we know threading is to blame. browsers try to thread things even though js doesn't always play nice with threads. anyone else got other ideas?

21:38  monkeynut: meowsus, you're not sorry :P
21:38  SwiftOne: Right, I was hoping not ot have to hack up the code to do that just to test it out.
21:38  Shown: tried then disabling any other .css or .js, nothing changed
21:38  SwiftOne: Because then we're in a further call stack...sigh.
21:39  meowsus: monkeynut, maybe a little?
21:39  Shown: tried putting jquery include at bottom of <body> tag just before include of qtip
21:39  Shown: but some other plugins stopped working
21:39  SwiftOne: monkeynut - yeah, alert box allows the DOM to update, that was in my orig demo.
21:39  monkeynut: come one meowsus ... we all know you really just saw the comma in the selector and sneakily removed it when you posted the code :P
21:40  SwiftOne: I put in a bug report but it was closed because it's a syncronous call, even though my update is before the call.
21:40  monkeynut: Swiftone, that's my point ...
21:40  meowsus: Hahaha
21:40  Shown: those plugin were working for 1.2.6, then yesterday moved to 1.4.3, and just by replacing the library, they worked normally
21:40  SwiftOne: monkeynut - but I'd argue this is a bug.  Step 1, then Step 2, then Step 3.  If Step 2 is blocking, that shouldn't block Step 1.
21:40  meowsus: It that were the case, i'd be doing my typical ritual when i find that dreadful comma. Smashing my face into the wall in shame.

21:41  SwiftOne: DavJ - If you're using JqueryUI, dialog with a modal works great.  IF not, you'll do the same stuff but it's not already written for you :)
21:41  monkeynut: SwiftOne, maybe.  If it's wrong in all browsers, then maybe there's an oddity in jquery responsible. I suspect it will be different in different browsers, and you'd have to take it up with the devs to convince them this is an issue (I would use it asnyc, as it should be! :P )

21:55  jeremyw: Is there a better way to do a field changed handler?  I can bind change and keyup but I'd like to cancel those events, or at least not handle them in my code, when the text really hasn't changed.
21:55  jeremyw: I can do this manually but I figured I'd ask first if there was some API/practice I hadn't seen yet that uses jQuery.
21:56  jeremyw: Right now, I'm binding both events to the input.  WOrks great unless I press keys that don't change text, like ctrl+a, which shouldn't actually invoke my validation stuff.
21:56  SwiftOne: jeremyw, I believe there are some other events, but they aren't supported in all browsers.
21:57  jeremyw: Okay.
21:58  jeremyw: Is there a preferred way to have "global" variables in JavaScript?  Something I can stuff context into in my function and read it upon funciton invocation?  I know this is a generic JavaScript question but I figure you guys know as well as any.

21:58  hdon: introspection question: what's the ideal way to test if an object is a jquery set?
21:59  hdon: i am getting weird behavior where in one case only, a .each() seems to be getting a jquery set with one member as its second argument, rather than getting the DOM element itself as expected
22:00  SwiftOne: jeremyw, create a single top-level var object that holds what you need.  (That's how Jquery itself does it).
22:00  jeremyw: SwiftOne: Great, thanks.
22:00  hdon: PooFormDialogue.forms.each(function(){console.log(this, this.getAttribute?'has':'does not have', 'getAttribute()')}) <-- expected behavior, has getAttribute. "this" is a DOM element, not a jquery set
22:01  hdon: PooFormDialogue.forms = $('form') basically
22:01  hdon: OH

22:10  monkeynut: AFAIK zend is server side ...
22:10  AdamPflug: @monkeynut Yeah, I'll try to put something togeter
22:10  AdamPflug: snover: If you think that will help sure, I can try that
22:11  jeremyw: ajpiano: Thanks for the throttle/debounce suggestion.  It's exactly what I needed.
22:11  snover: Zend Framework is a PHP …thing
22:11  snover: oh right, Framework.
22:11  DonkeyCongo: How do I execute a script when an iframe is .ready()?
22:11  bot-t: DonkeyCongo, The Idea Mill » Blog Archive » New jQuery Plugin - $.frameReady() - http://ideamill.synaptrixgroup.com/?p=6
22:12  Michael: SwiftOne, It's just another bloated MVC framework
22:12  Michael: monkeynut, yes zend is server side
22:12  snover: bloated?! What do you mean!?! I can get a whole 6 page loads per second!!!
22:12  Michael: But there's really not much of a need to have a server side framework
22:13  Michael: (for us)
22:13  Michael: We can utilize a JS framework talking to a restful API and have the whole site as static HTML/JS rather than PHP templates or whatever
22:14  Michael: My colleague was just in Seattle for the Disney HTML5 conference and someone presented a pure JS framework
22:14  Michael: trying to remember what it was
22:14  alaing_away: where can i learn more about templating
22:17  SwiftOne: Michael, No luck here, whatever it was I wasn't interested enough to keep it.
22:18  Michael: I suppose sammy.js would be a comparison
22:18  Michael: SwiftOne, Pardon?
22:18  AdamPflug: snover: I only see 1.4.4rc2, where do I get 1.4.4rc3?
22:19  snover: if only there was some sort of standard naming convention in use
22:19  snover: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.4rc3.js
22:20  kn0wn: hi, i don't really know JS or jQuery, just trying to make a minor change to my forum, so hoping this question is still somewhat legible
22:21  kn0wn: i'm trying to show the page numbers for a thread when the thread row is hovered over, just not sure how to "select" & show the pagination bit
22:21  kn0wn: where i'm at: http://codepad.org/HyCSW9iO
22:21  hdon: i frequently find myself slicing arguments. it would be great if $.slice() would $.makeArray() the first arg, then call .slice with the rest of the args
22:21  mr_mustard: is there a way to add parameters to a post request on beforeSend, or something?
22:22  hdon: mr_mustard, you could override the form submission behavior altogether
22:22  jbelcher: Was curious what you guys thought about something: I have to design a section of a website which will hold a large unordered list. Vertical space is a premium, so I'll have to have some way of navigating the list without having it displayed all the once. I'm not sure I like internal scrolling, since this will eventually go mobile, and pagination can be problematic if any title wraps several lines.
22:22  kn0wn: anyone got any idea?
22:22  jbelcher: CSS3 multicolumn works okay, but implementing that for IE is a little fragile
22:22  k1ng: www.keyabp.com is killing my browser... any idea why?
22:22  mr_mustard: hdon, I'm not submitting a form... I'm using a post request to send some data... and I like to add a parameter to the post data just before sending..
22:22  SwiftOne: alaing_away, here's a decent template intro: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-working-with-the-official-jquery-templating-plugin/
22:23  hdon: mr_mustard, oh, i see
22:23  hdon: sorry for my assumption
22:23  alaing_away: thanks SwiftOne
22:24  DaveJ|UK: Is the disabled option of jq ui dialog meant to prevent it being moves, closed, etc. by the user?
22:24  SwiftOne: mr_mustard, the data param to the ajax call can be the result of a function.
22:24  mr_mustard: SwiftOne, wich function?
22:24  kn0wn: sigh, guess i'll be getting no help
22:25  SwiftOne: kn0wn, I'm looking at your thing now
22:25  kn0wn: SwiftOne: thanks
22:25  monkeynut: patience kn0wn :P
22:26  monkeynut: AdamPflug, did you post code for your problem or have you sorted it?
22:26  kn0wn: i'm assuming i'll have to use .find() but the syntax is a bit weird, especially given i haven't used JS/jQuery before
22:26  SwiftOne: mr_mustard, You can write one.  instead of data: {foo: bar} or data: $(form).serialize() you can have data: function(){ //build and return object here,}
22:27  SwiftOne: kn0wn, you probably don't need find, you can just pass the necessary selector to the jquery function.
22:27  kn0wn: SwiftOne: example please?
22:28  SwiftOne: kn0wn, first help my understand what you're trying to do a bit more.
22:28  monkeynut: kn0wn, your hover events aren't being associated with anything
22:28  kn0wn: SwiftOne: when a #threadbit is hovered over, the page numbers are shown
22:28  mr_mustard: SwiftOne, that's true... my head is still getting used to javascript's syntax...
22:28  monkeynut: kn0wn, # means id, you don't have an element with that id
22:28  monkeynut: you have an emlement with that class
22:28  kn0wn: so, ".threadbit"?
22:29  monkeynut: to act on hover over a row, use $('#mytableid tr').hover(
22:29  monkeynut: well, .threadbit would work to do something when the table is hovered over
22:29  AdamPflug: monkeynut: I'm working on trying to get a working example up. The code isn't at a public location and references a web service so it's non-trivial :)
22:29  kn0wn: <kn0wn> where i'm at: http://codepad.org/HyCSW9iO
22:29  kn0wn: when a threadbit is hovered over, i want to show the pagination bit
22:30  monkeynut: kn0wn but if instead you bind it to each row (as I showed above) then inside the function $(this) will refer to the row
22:30  kn0wn: threadinfo -> inner -> threadmeta -> author -> pagination
22:30  monkeynut: AdamPflug, that's fine, take your time, just wasn't sure if I missed it or if it's resolved.
22:30  ProLoser|Work: is it possible to live bind entire plugins and non-event related behaviors?
22:30  kn0wn: monkeynut: if it wasn't apparent enough, i don't know much about web development :(
22:31  kn0wn: i'm not sure how that translates given that the id for each threadbit is different
22:31  monkeynut: he he, don't worry kn0wn, I think that's true of most people who aren't here often ;)
22:31  kn0wn: again, note the code: http://codepad.org/HyCSW9iO
22:31  kn0wn: <li class="threadbit dot hot new" id="thread_3326">
22:31  monkeynut: gimme a sec
22:32  monkeynut: kn0wn, I see now, I assumed when you said rows you were using a table
22:32  monkeynut: kn0wn, yes changing that # to . should mean $(this) refers to the li
22:33  rchern: Is there an easy way to hook into ajax response handlers without going through and adding code everywhere?
22:33  kn0wn: monkeynut: so how would i select the pagination bit?
22:33  SwiftOne: kn0wn, so when you say "the pagination bit", do you mean you want the part of the HTML listing the pagination to show?
22:33  kn0wn: SwiftOne: bingo
22:33  monkeynut: $('.threadbit').hover(
22:33  ProLoser|Work: if i'm using live bind, what event do i use for just loading the html?
22:34  monkeynut: and then $(this).find('.pagination') will refer to the element you're after
22:34  kn0wn: so i should be using .find()?
22:35  johnf__: Monkeynut: yesterday I was directed to a channel that covered all aspects of the using django,jquery, etc...  could you provide it please
22:35  kn0wn: SwiftOne: that seems to differ with what you were saying
22:35  k1ng: www.keyabp.com is killing my browser... any idea why?
22:35  monkeynut: I would, unless SwiftOne has a better idea ... also needs to add a bit to the selector I gave
22:35  rchern: n/m
22:35  SwiftOne: Nope, I was just misunderstanding.
22:35  monkeynut: because you actually want the pagination bit, then use .text() to get the contents
22:36  SwiftOne: You can pass it in as context, but find is the most intuitive.
22:36  monkeynut: johnf__ sorry, don't still have the link. Anyone here (ajpiano,mekwall,?) know the bot command to show links from a given day?
22:36  kn0wn: so, $(this).find(".pagination").show(0); ?
22:36  SwiftOne: kn0wn, does this do what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/SwiftOne/cde5Z/
22:36  monkeynut: kn0wn, not .show(). That will show the element
22:37  monkeynut: you want .text() to get the text there as far as I understand?
22:37  johnf__: monkeynut: recall I was called raw clay on that channel
22:38  kn0wn: monkeynut: i'm thinking .show() would be best given it's not just text
22:38  kn0wn: SwiftOne: so .show() without any parameters is instant?
22:38  monkeynut: fyi, kn0wn, when you get the hang of it, if you are more precise with your selector your code will act faster, so using > to go down each level so find has less work to do
22:38  kn0wn: monkeynut: that's what i was figuring
22:39  monkeynut: you should be well on your way now then, kn0wn ;)
22:39  kn0wn: traversing the block to find something based on its class seems theoretically slow
22:39  kn0wn: i assumed there would be a way to directly reference it by going down the "tree"
22:39  SwiftOne: kn0wn, show w/o params uses the default speed, which I almost never alter :)
22:39  monkeynut: kn0wn, there is, using >
22:39  kn0wn: SwiftOne: .show(0) is with 0ms delay though, right?
22:40  kn0wn: 0ms transition*
22:40  monkeynut: kn0wn element > child > deeperchild  and so on
22:40  kn0wn: monkeynut: so how would that translate for this example?
22:40  monkeynut: kn0wn, you can omit the 0 it will work out to do it as if you put 0
22:41  monkeynut: kn0wn, i'll show you part way and let you complete it
22:41  kn0wn: monkeynut: SwiftOne said "default speed", which i assumed was something other than 0 given his answer
22:42  kn0wn: api.jquery.com doesn't seem to list the default parameter value
22:42  k1ng: someone please help me with jscroller.js
22:42  monkeynut: kn0wn, I think he's technically more accurate as you may be able to set a different default and the default may change in future
22:42  k1ng: i cant just make it work :(
22:42  SwiftOne: kn0wn, trust monkeynut over me, he was helping me earlier :)
22:42  kn0wn: so .show(0); would be best in terms of standards-compliance?
22:43  monkeynut: kn0wn, I guess so, but i've always just used .show() and it's good for me :)
22:43  monkeynut: I don't see it changing or being an issue, but whatever makes you happy ;)
22:43  SwiftOne: "With no parameters, the .show() method is the simplest way to display an element: The matched elements will be revealed immediately, with no animation. "
22:43  SwiftOne: I too use show() with no params all the time.
22:43  kn0wn: SwiftOne: ah, that's good enough for me :)
22:44  k1ng: someone please help me
22:44  chrismcintosh: say i have an area with a bunch of similar items(say a set of 10+ divs with a class of .photo)
22:44  SwiftOne: kn0wn, did my sample execute the way you wanted, or did I misunderstand?
22:44  k1ng: i have been trying get it work for almost 3 hours
22:44  monkeynut: $(this).find('div.rating5 > div.threadinfo >div.inner > h3.threadtitle    ... can you take it from here, kn0wn?
22:44  chrismcintosh: and each could have one of a couple additional classes, i want to have an event when i click a link that can test for that class, then if it exists add another class
22:45  kn0wn: monkeynut: .rating5 is for threads with a 5-star rating
22:45  kn0wn: SwiftOne: it was what i wanted
22:45  kn0wn: <kn0wn> so, $(this).find(".pagination").show(0); ?
22:45  kn0wn: <SwiftOne> kn0wn, does this do what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/SwiftOne/cde5Z/
22:45  kn0wn: monkeynut: div:first ?
22:46  monkeynut: kn0wn, then remove that class, is there just one div each layer down? if so, removing the class is fine, otherwise you'll need additional selectors. probably :eq(n) or :first e.t.c.
22:46  chrismcintosh: so say i have a $('#gallery photo').hasClass('trains'); and i click a train link, i want to add a class called .feature to each of the elements in #gallery that are .photo.train
22:47  ajpiano: chrismcintosh, paste your markup
22:47  kn0wn: monkeynut: so "div:first" would be correct?
22:47  monkeynut: yup, that sould work kn0wn
22:47  AdamPflug: monkeynut: pastebin of the actual code: http://jsfiddle.net/WEd2G/1/ (doesnt run). pastebin with web service call replaced with a static variable: http://jsfiddle.net/6mm4k/ (works, but also doesn't have the error),

22:48  k1ng: SwiftOne, no
22:48  k1ng: there is no error
22:48  k1ng: its just jscroller is not working

22:49  kn0wn: monkeynut: another dumb question: i'd just embed it in a <script> block? or do i need to do it onload?
22:49  chrismcintosh: nevermind figured it out
22:49  monkeynut: AdamPflug, looks ok to me, what's the issue again?
22:50  monkeynut: good work chrismcintosh , that's the spirit ;)
22:50  chrismcintosh: just had the ask the question in type
22:50  SwiftOne: k1ng, sorry, I've never used that plugin.
22:50  chrismcintosh: often times thats all i need to figure it out
22:50  AdamPflug: The issue is that in my local code, .children("...").length is 1 and .find("...").length is 0
22:50  k1ng: ah
22:50  k1ng: any good plugin like that?
22:51  monkeynut: ok AdamPflug
22:53  donli: Hello, Monkeynut. This is Donli again. I want to implement drag-drop style like igoogle. Please see http://jsfiddle.net/dodoflying/BGMCq/
22:53  monkeynut: AdamPflug, I may know the answer, can you do a test for me?
22:53  donli: One problem is that how to avoid covered of the divs by each other.
22:53  ajpiano: johnfa_, don't send dcc private chat invites
22:54  johnfa_: OK - can you call me?
22:54  danheberden: good luck johnfa_ he never returns my calls
22:54  AdamPflug: monkeynut: updated example with working demonstration of the bug and much closer to my actual code: http://jsfiddle.net/WEd2G/2/
22:54  monkeynut: AdamPflug, your xml has upper and lowercase but selector is all lower case. I think .find is being more pedantic, so if you change both selectors to match the correct case, they should both give 1.
22:54  johnfa_: actually I should have asked for a chat
22:55  monkeynut: hello donli
22:55  donli: yes
22:55  monkeynut: i'm running out of time donli, but i'll try and help quick, what's the issue?
22:56  monkeynut: brb
22:56  donli: As you could see http://jsfiddle.net/dodoflying/BGMCq/, the div shopping is covered by others. I just want other divs will not been covered by each other.
22:57  AdamPflug: monkeynut: looks like that did it. Thanks!
22:57  AdamPflug: huge help :). Can't believe I missed that....
22:57  taitems: is there somewhere, or someone, that has more information on the release schedule for jquery mobile?

22:59  taitems: i've found some stuff saying 1.0 will be out in january, but are we expecting more alphas or betas in the mean time?

23:06  Pepr: Wow, all day at experimenting and nothing to come of it. Does anyone have a jQueryish method or plugin that can check what plugin a browser will play with a mime-type.
23:06  kn0wn: http://codepad.org/HyCSW9iO
23:07  Brodingo: ?map
23:07  bot-t: .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
23:08  morsik: hello,
23:08  Pepr: in essence I am trying to create a method that will accept a mimetype ( 'video/x-vs-wmv') and it will return the plugin name.
23:08  Brodingo: so i wanna map and get an array of data-* values and then test if a variable is in the array
23:08  Brodingo: i guess that wasnt a question
23:08  monkeynut: kn0wn, you missed div.threadmeta look through the dom carefully ;)
23:08  morsik: it that possible to send some message from server to jquery clients? i just made simple page with notes (reloading via jquery one per 5 seconds)
23:08  Pepr: lets say that there are alot of references and complaining on the internet but no real answers... /sigh
23:08  morsik: and i made code for reloading css
23:09  morsik: but i want just send once signal "reload css" not every refresh... how can i do that?
23:10  monkeynut: kn0wn, i would often advise to use the simpler method that works and optimise later.  If you shift that dom around a bit while developing the simple method will still work but the 'faster' one will break. Get it working, then optimise (unless optimistion is crucial design decision)
23:11  monkeynut: morsik, i think you're missing something about how these connections work
23:11  kn0wn: hm, .show seems to conflict with the "display: inline-block" setting
23:11  kn0wn: any suggestions, monkeynut?
23:11  monkeynut: morsik, you can request a page from a web server, but a web server can't force a page on a client out of the blue
23:12  morsik: monkeynut: ok ok :\ well the only method is to do reloading some content with some interval yep?
23:12  monkeynut: kn0wn, how does it conflict? is it hidden before you find it? what effect do you want, now that you have selected it?
23:12  Brodingo: so map just returns an array?
23:13  kn0wn: monkeynut: it gets forced onto a new line when i hover over it
23:13  monkeynut: morsik, that's the method I use. I make a special tiny page and use setInterval + ajax to request it if I need to keep 'polling the server'.
23:13  morsik: monkeynut: ok, then i did that, but how can i send something once?
23:13  monkeynut: kn0wn, can I see it in action?
23:14  johnfa_: monkeynut: woud you chat with me on dcc private
23:14  morsik: now i have script which is loading with interval 5 seconds, and have js script for reloading page/css
23:14  morsik: but i wan't to reload clients css only one... not every 5s
23:14  monkeynut: morsik, you can cancel the interval timer once the 'load css' has been received
23:14  kn0wn: monkeynut: http://imgur.com/UCW7R.png
23:15  kn0wn: normally it'd stick on the same line as the the timestamp
23:15  SwiftOne: monkeynut, Headed out, I'm in awe of your contributions here.  Thanks!
23:15  monkeynut: morsik, it can poll the server and only reload css when the server sends a message that says "do it"
23:15  monkeynut: SwiftOne, thanks :) just remember it when I need help :P
23:16  morsik: monkeynut: hmm... but how can i send that "do it"? now index.php loading reload.php - js script which reloads css
23:16  kn0wn: hmmm

23:27  monkeynut: morsik, that really depends on number of users and server bandwidth but I think 1 sec would be fine, how instantly do they have to react?

23:45  thomasd: the function to my understanding is suposed to make shure that the bottom of the prototype is an Object and not any other Ecmascript native.
23:45  danheberden: first and last element
23:45  danheberden: ?source isPlainObject
23:45  bot-t: Line#461 - "isPlainObject: function( obj ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#line-461
23:46  danheberden: line 525
23:46  danheberden: *523
23:46  snover: thomasd: get to the point; what behaviour is happening that makes you think there is a bug?
23:47  danheberden: hm... just is the last.. thought first was checked too
23:47  thomasd: well it is possable to make an object that does not have any ECMAscript native at the bottom of the prototype chain
23:48  thomasd: all Ecmascript natives have null as the prototype of there prototype
23:48  snover: thomasd: you are not getting to the point here friend. what are you doing? what do you expect to happen? what actually happens?
23:48  thomasd: it is possable to have an object that has null as it's prototype
23:48  thomasd: ok
23:49  thomasd: F (){}; F.prototype = null; var obj = new F;
23:49  thomasd: jquery.isPlainObject(obj) = true;
23:49  amh345: can anyone help a newb out?   i'm trying to create a tooltip that will have a link inside it..  but right now whenever i rollover my div the tooltip spazzes and flickers to show/hide.   i just want it to stay on while im hovering over the div and go away when im not on the div.  ive put the bit of code in a pastebin. http://pastebin.com/xVCew16j
23:50  snover: thomasd: why in god’s name are you doing that
23:50  thomasd: but obj is not a plain object it was not created with New Object or {} and therefore does not have any of the plain object prototype methods
23:50  danheberden: ?eval F(){}; F.prototype = null; var obj = new F; jQuery.isPlainObject(obj);
23:50  bot-t: danheberden: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
23:51  danheberden: ?eval function F(){}; F.prototype = null; var obj = new F; jQuery.isPlainObject(obj);
23:51  bot-t: danheberden: true
23:51  thomasd: see
23:51  thomasd: ?eval obj.hasOwnProperty
23:51  bot-t: thomasd: ReferenceError: obj is not defined
23:51  danheberden: i'm more curious to the answer of snover's question
23:51  zachera: hi, i'm getting an error when trying to use the cookie plugin: "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (i,r){return new b.fn.init(i,r)} has no method 'cookie'"
23:51  snover: thomasd: If you are doing something dumb as hell and it breaks it’s not a bug in jQuery, it’s you doing something stupd
23:52 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
23:52  thomasd: ?eval F(){}; F.prototype = null; var obj = new F; Obj.hasOwnProperty;
23:52  bot-t: thomasd: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
23:52  snover: it’s not the library’s job to handle corner cases or just plain wrong code
23:52  snover: thomasd: once again *why* are you setting the object prototype to null?
23:54  thomasd: because in a for in loop the only property's that will show up in the loop will be ones that i defined. that way I don't have to filter my for in loops
23:55  emanu: so I have a <td contenteditable="true" class="submittable"> content </td>, and I want to make it so that I can edit text in the cell and when I leave the cell, it performs an action. I did : $(".editable").blur(function() { alert('blurred!');}); but when I click on a cell, then unclick. There's no alert that pops up.
23:55  emanu: what am I doing wrong?
23:55  thomasd: and if i want to check if an object has a property there is one less layer in the prototype chain to deal wiht
23:55  thomasd: with
23:56  kelster75: emanu: in your example markup, you have (class) .submittable but you're attaching to .editable ...
23:56  snover: thomasd: you win the award for braindead design decisions of the month…
23:56 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
23:56  thomasd: why do you say that
23:56  emanu: kelster75: sorry, I copy/pasted and accidentally renamed it in my example. The selector is proper in my code. Even if I attach a click event to the <td>, it never pops up...
23:56  diamonds: snover: geez why so hostile?
23:57  amh345: anyone?? bueller?
23:57 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
23:57  snover: diamonds: because it makes me die a little inside
23:57  diamonds: did he spit on your mother or something?
23:57  atula: Javascript is our mother.. jQuery is our father...
23:57  atula: please insulting our parents
23:57  atula: STOP insulting
23:58  diamonds: jquery has a bug
23:58  snover: thomasd: Because you are breaking all of the object’s functionality.
23:58  diamonds: JUST KIDDING!!!
23:58  zachera: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (i,r){return new b.fn.init(i,r)} has no method 'cookie'
23:58  zachera: what
23:58  atula: diamonds:  no u!
23:58 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:58 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
23:58  diamonds: atula: touché
23:59  diamonds: wait, lemme try again:
23:59  diamonds: jQuery is broken
23:59  diamonds: there we go
23:59  thomasd: snover: the Object.prototype does not have many practacal uses exept for filtering for in loops
23:59  atula: fix it then, diamonds
23:59  diamonds: ^^that's some high quality bug reportin'
23:59 @coldhead: thanks for raising that problem thomasd, its an interesting case
