00:00  t2gs: you can do that with css and a jquery .toggleClass
00:00  t2gs: $(this).parent().toggleClass('hover')
00:00  t2gs: div {}
00:00  Do``: is there a way to do $.getScript multiple scripts and return/run the function when both loaded (but I'd like to avoid loading them one after the other, because that's inefficient)
00:00  t2gs: div.hover {}
00:00  t2gs: Do`` for { $.getScript }
00:00  t2gs: gg
00:01  ajpiano: Do``: there is support for that type of thing in jquery 1.5
00:01  ScottO_: how would i trigger on all radios that are selected?
00:01  ScottO_: :selected only seems to work on select elements
00:02  Do``: ajpiano: awesome, so i take it there's nothing built in 1.4.4
00:02  ajpiano: no
00:02  ajpiano: but 1.5 is in a beta
00:02  ScottO_: nm... checked
00:02  ajpiano: as of just a few days ago
00:02  ajpiano: the stuff you're asking about landed like just the other day
00:02  Do``: right, i've seen the news
00:02  ajpiano: cause now there's $.when(foo,bar)
00:02  ajpiano: which could be scripts
00:03  ajpiano: OTOH, Do``, you could use a script loader
00:03  ajpiano: like RequireJS
00:04  Do``: i think i'll just build something simple for this occasion then
00:05  Do``: should be easy enough to count the number of callbacks and run the actual callback at the end
00:05  ajpiano: ya
00:05  Do``: might be a better choice then an extra file like requirejs
00:05  ajpiano: changing to script loading that way isn't just like, another file, it's really a different way of thinking
00:06  ajpiano: imo
00:06  ajpiano: speaking of anotherway of thinking...beer thirty is coming up!

00:55  RoaDin: ty trend.
00:56  coachz: that gets me the text area value but i need to find out how to get TinyMce to write it's contents to it
00:56  timmywil: bmxer, np
00:56  ss23: o.o
00:56  ss23: "write its contents"?
00:57  ss23: I don't think I understand what you're using TinyMCE for...
00:57  heverl: Hello, how could I encode \u9999 that it doesn't become a Unicode character, nor "%5Cu9999" (http://pastebin.com/YqsiaWNK)?
00:57  coachz: yeah TinyMce apparently pulls the data from the textarea and then you have to write it back when you're done editing
00:57  coachz: if i'm understanding it
00:57  ss23: No
00:57  ss23: It decorates the textarea
00:57  ss23: And writes/reads straight from it the entire time
00:57  Trisox: nope
00:57  Trisox: indeed
00:57  Trisox: ;)
00:57  Trisox: try clearing it hehe
00:58  coachz: when i add content to the text editor i dont' see that added content in the textarea
00:58  ss23: Works for me. idk oc
00:58  coachz: i load an html file into it and make edits
00:58  Trisox: because you have to use other codes than just go true the textarea
00:58  coachz: then i read the textarea but don't see the changes
00:59  coachz: console.log($('textarea#content').val());
00:59  coachz: that doesn't show my changes i make in TinyMce
01:00  coachz: it just shows the html content before i edit it
01:04  Trisox: var text = tinyMCE.get('myeditorid').getContent();
01:04  Trisox: try that
01:04  heverl: Can I tell jQuery not to change \ into %5C if it perfoms a GET request?
01:05  Trisox: you can get the content
01:05  coachz: k
01:05  Trisox: i dont know what the code is for setting it
01:06  coachz: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getContent' of undefined
01:07  Trisox: i did this once <a href="javascript:;" onclick="tinyMCE.execCommand('mceInsertContent',false,'<a href=http://google.com</a>');">google</a><br>
01:07  Trisox: for setting stuff
01:07  coachz: i just wish i could get it :-(
01:07  Trisox: coachz think you should go to the tinymce forms

03:46  adatta02: bananasontoast, what are you trying to parse it with on the server?
03:46  adatta02: you could just handle the parsing on the  client side also?
03:46  bananasontoast: adatta02: Again, right now I am just writing a spike that will work all client side. It's just demonstrating some functionality, we don't need to persist any data or write to databases yet.
03:48  coldhead: i don't know what a spike is :(
03:48  coldhead: oh agile
03:49  adatta02: ok so whats the problem?
03:49  bananasontoast: coldhead: It's just an agile term. It just means that I am writing a demo, i.e. it's all front-end to show functionality and no back end...
03:49  bananasontoast: adatta02: Well I just want to parse that string back out once it's serialised.
03:50  adatta02: as coldhead suggested you can use the Crowford JSON library to serialize/unserialize it?
03:50  bananasontoast: adatta02: Yep, that would be idea. Sorry, if I am crap at explaining this. I just need to know how to use that library. I can't find many good examples, and certainly struggling to find any that might apply to what I am doing.
03:52  bananasontoast: Give me two seconds and I'll put my work somewhere and maybe it will make more sense... be nice though, it's just the beginnings of a demo... lol
03:52  adatta02: bananasontoast, yah no worries - it's really straightforward to use the JSON library
03:53  adatta02: basically, from what you explained you'd want to do something like var obj = JSON.parse( $("#idoftextarea").val() ); and you'll get the object back
03:57  bananasontoast: adatta02: Yep, that's what I want. But how do I work with that object now. i.e. how do I just output each value or something similar?
03:58  adatta02: you could iterate over it with $.each( obj, function(k, v){ // do stuff });

04:16  Jester831: I guess what I mean is there a way to take foo ? foo : 0 and replace the second foo with a this/value
04:18  adatta02: Jester831, http://pastie.org/1472324 ?
04:19  Jester831: yea I suppose that is always viable
04:21  adatta02: you could also presumably do something like http://pastie.org/1472327
04:21  adatta02: I mean both are a lot more opaque than just doing it inline...
04:23  Jester831: thanks mate

04:52  coldhead: show us your cunnie!
04:53  Jester831: hmmmm, tmpl isn't working... is it not implemented yet??
04:54  khurram: i am looking for a search jquery code which searches the contents from the pages i have on my web site as well as from database
04:54  joshsmith: what's the best way to return an array from something server-side?
04:54  khurram: does any one know a good jquery plugin for that
04:55  someprimetime: what is digg using for their login errors @ www.digg.com
04:55  joshsmith: khurram: jQuery won't search content from your DB
04:55  someprimetime: when you get something wrong, the top slides down and shows the error
04:55  RTPMatt: ?json @ joshsmith
04:55  bot-t: joshsmith, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
04:55  joshsmith: khurram: if you have MySQL, though, you should use sphinxsearch.com
04:55  khurram: thankx joshsmit i try this
04:55  joshsmith: RTPMatt: yeah, but when you return it, should you be doing something like echoing out '[1,2,3]' ?
04:56  Jester831: damnit coldhead I'm getting that an error that there is no method tmpl and I don't see it in jquery either.... is this something that's not released??
04:56  joshsmith: server-side, that is, and then in the $.ajax assigning that to a var?
04:57  RTPMatt: eh, when you do the ajax request, you will get back the data as a param to the ajax callback
04:57  coldhead: Jester831: you need to download the plugin
04:57  coldhead: its not in jQuery (yet)
04:57  coldhead: it will be official
04:57  coldhead: but not today
04:57  joshsmith: yeah, I know that, but I'm not sure how to format that param server-side to have it actually be an array in jQuery
04:57  Jester831: OK, that makes me want to rage less
04:57  Jester831: I rewrote a lot of stuff for that =/
04:58  joshsmith: is it enough to echo out "[1,2,3]" and assign the returned param from the callback to a var to create the array?
04:58  RTPMatt: oh, well, if you are using php, use the json_encode method, and return the result
04:59  RTPMatt: if not using php, find a library that well create json for you
04:59  joshsmith: yeah, I already do that for my all other JSON data
04:59  joshsmith: just never done it for an array previously
04:59  joshsmith: a JS array, that is
04:59  RTPMatt: then, just do that
05:00  joshsmith: alrighty, just wasn't sure if there was something extra-special I had to for arrays
05:00  joshsmith: guess not
05:00  joshsmith: cheers
05:00  RTPMatt: good luck
05:00  Jester831: am I going to have issues with this and IE coldhead?

05:13  coldhead: lol snover

05:13  tbranyen: lol 100%
05:14  tbranyen: well just about
05:14  tbranyen: 96% rounded up!
05:14  RTPMatt: we only count desktops now?
05:14  RTPMatt: hah
05:14  tbranyen: yeah if you want to argue the definition of what a desktop is
05:14  tbranyen: which would be fairly pointless
05:14  Jester831: coldhead: this plugin is painfully slow doesn't accept html variables ;(
05:14  tbranyen: oh noes laptops can't have desktop settings, they aren't desktops!!!!
05:15  tbranyen: quick rewrite every OS ever
05:15  tbranyen: Jester831: html variables?
05:15  vladikoff: atrix is a desktop
05:15  tbranyen: jQuery objects or xmldocs or dom nodes or wtf do mean html variables lol
05:15  Jester831: well, I can't pass html into tmpl
05:15  devinrolsen: IE seems to have a problem with testing if an images is loaded when passing a .load() the images source. But IE only.
05:16  Jester831: it's a variable containing html ;)
05:16  tbranyen: Jester831: wrap it in jQuery?
05:16  letterpress: delvinrolsen: should line 40 img = new Image(), have a semi-colon at the end instead of a comma?
05:16  letterpress: nevermind
05:17  Jester831: this is getting really convoluted ;(
05:17  tbranyen: devinrolsen: your website is far too weird for me to even want to view the source
05:17  devinrolsen: lol its just a demo man.
05:17  devinrolsen: but I would feel that same what upon first look I guess.
05:17  Jester831: devlinrolsen... wtf are those???
05:18  tbranyen: devinrolsen: why are you using new Image()?
05:18  letterpress: wait maybe that comma is a problem...
05:18  tbranyen: why not just img = $("<img/>").fadeTo(0,0);
05:18  tbranyen: letterpress: its not
05:19  tbranyen: also devin move jquery down to right before your <script> tag
05:19  tbranyen: no point keeping it in the head
05:19  tbranyen: also use the html5 doctype foo
05:19  tbranyen: also you don't need each
05:19  tbranyen: just attach click to a.thumbnail
05:19  aca20031: var nameinput = $('<input type="text" class="testlist-add-name">').attr("value",namediv.html());namediv.replaceWith(nameinput); - Any not so obvious reason that when I do this the stuff to the right moves down to the next line? testlist-add-name has display:inline-block
05:19  devinrolsen: they reason for the new Image() is cause when you use this version http://tinyurl.com/4es4fzd
05:20  devinrolsen: IE mac has a problem with loading the image if you click it twice.
05:20  devinrolsen: using an image object fixes this problem.
05:20  tbranyen: devinrolsen: whats IE mac?
05:20  devinrolsen: well using it and swapping current with new that is.
05:20  tbranyen: You mean IE 5
05:20  tbranyen: that nobody cares about
05:20  tbranyen: beacause its not used ever
05:20  tbranyen: because*
05:21  tbranyen: devinrolsen: Also thats not at all the same code as what i just gave you
05:21  devinrolsen: well it might be more than just ie mac
05:21  tbranyen: You're making false associations
05:21  tbranyen: Which isn't fine, what is fine is listening to help
05:21  devinrolsen: one of my readers sent me a vid of him trying to get it work on his mac but it fails.
05:21  tbranyen: I just gave you a ton of advice
05:21  tbranyen: devinrolsen: I don't care, what you just linked me to isn't what I just gave you.
05:21  tbranyen: They are different.
05:22  tbranyen: new Image() returns an image object, $("<img/>")[0] does the same thing
05:22  tbranyen: so $("<img/>").fadeTo(0,0) will work fine
05:24 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
05:24  devinrolsen: maybe I am missing the point. I have no problem with how I fade or animate the opacity. The issue is now in all IE, I get a error "Could not complete this opperation due to error c00ce514".
05:24  devinrolsen: IE is having a problem with using the new images src in conjunction with the .load()
05:24  devinrolsen: to test if the image has truely loaded to being displaying the new version.
05:25  tbranyen: uh what
05:25  tbranyen: devinrolsen: what version of IE?
05:25  tbranyen: ?bug
05:25  bot-t: Think about it - Is it more likely that there's a bug in a library used by most of the internet, or that you made a mistake? http://is.gd/bVMO3
05:25  devinrolsen: so far, IE8 and 7
05:25  tbranyen: yeah thats probably you
05:25  devinrolsen: on win7
05:25  tbranyen: doing something weird
05:26  tbranyen: like new Image()
05:26  panfist: is there a syntax to chain something like hasClass() on a selector? when i try it says 'object 'true' has no method 'hasClass'' ...
05:27  tbranyen: panfist: because hasClass() returns a boolean
05:27  panfist: is there any more efficient way to use hasClass a lot other than
05:27  panfist: sorry i didnt mean to enter that
05:27  tbranyen: panfist: you can use map
05:27  panfist: ok
05:28  tbranyen: chain().chain().map(function() { if( $(this).hasClass("something") { return this; }).something()
05:28  devinrolsen: well the error is result of character set encoding. I fear that trying to pass the source of an image to the .load() freaks IE out with wrong character set encoding in the request. Just wondering if anyone else has had this issue.
05:28  devinrolsen: or a solution.
05:28  tbranyen: obv some syntax errors there
05:28  tbranyen: devinrolsen: you aren't making any sense
05:28  devinrolsen: the error IE gives me.
05:28  tbranyen: and i fear you're making up answers
05:28  devinrolsen: http://nevyan.blogspot.com/2008/12/easy-solve-ajax-c00ce514-error.html
05:28  coldhead: ?ba cond plugin @ panfist
05:28  bot-t: panfist, cowboy/jquery-misc - GitHub - https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc
05:29  tbranyen: wtf another alman plugin
05:29  devinrolsen: why would I make up answers, its what I have researched so far man.
05:29  coldhead: panfist: https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-cond.js is the one i meant
05:29  tbranyen: devinrolsen: i didn't realize you were ajaxing the images
05:30  tbranyen: IE gives lots of weird errors
05:30  tbranyen: i'm not so certain thats the problem, if it is
05:30  tbranyen: gat damn
05:30  tbranyen: set some meta charset

06:57  TonkaTruck: hi all.  http://pastebin.com/Xdi2XRg3 Is the solution to passing an array to a callback by reference just to wrap it in an object?  Sorry this isn't jquery specific...just looking for a js ninja or even yellow belt...
06:58  tonyjcamp: Can someone explain what the !! is used for? bool = !!elem.canPlayType
06:58  ss23: To cast to a bool
06:58  ss23: But it's horrible
06:58  ss23: At least, I think it does
06:58  tonyjcamp: horrible?
06:58  tonyjcamp: how come?
06:59  ss23: The fact that you had to ask what it does speaks words about it
06:59  ss23: If you can't look at code and know exactly what it does, and people have to ask, it's a sign you're writing silly code
06:59  tonyjcamp: Some pretty smart fellas are using it.
06:59  ss23: Some pretty smart fella's can be not smart too
06:59  panfist: is there a pattern in jquery to do something like... select a div with this id, or if it doesn't exist, create it
07:00  tonyjcamp: I'm very green too, so it's prolly my lack of experience not knowing what it's doing.
07:00  ss23: I don't know enough jQuery/JS to actually know if its "correct"
07:01  joshsmith: RTPMatt: you still around?
07:01  joshsmith: dr0id: !!!
07:01  tonyjcamp: @ss23 so it's just converting a string to a boolean?

07:09 @coldhead: that was my idea
07:09 @coldhead: how dare you
07:09  dr0id: well, 1. that wasn't yer idea, 2. if you think that was yer idea I don't mind and that's why ready for the 100 bucks offer
07:10  dr0id: :P
07:10  TonkaTruck: http://pastebin.com/Xdi2XRg3 it's only 19 lines.  There isn't a problem so much as I wondered what the protocol or blessed pattern might be to pass the array by reference to the callback.  I think the solution really is simply wrapping "data" in an object.
07:10  dr0id: joshsmith: BOL with that, and let me know when yer making 1k a month with that ;)

08:07  mekwall: hmm... trying to figure out a name of an actor. he's in the 60s today, white hair and funny accent... he usually plays one of the bad guys :p
08:07  ss23: That's insane undescriptove
08:07  ss23: Especially given we don't know what you consider to be an "accent"

08:08  mekwall: ss23: haha yeah I know
08:08  mekwall: hilko: not that funny accent haha
08:08  hilko: hey, his accent is badass
08:08  hilko: don't diss the dutch
08:08  mekwall: haha
08:13  mattalexx: ajpiano, Huh, I've never seen that sytax before.
08:13  mattalexx: I didn't know you could pass the method name as a string
08:13  ajpiano: now you do
08:17  RoaDin: okay, I've been looking over the Doc's and trying to send an array with the .post
08:17  RoaDin: and do not see it anywhere.
08:19  mekwall: found him... christopher walken :P doh
08:19  mattalexx: mekwall, He has no funny accent to me, I'm from the States.
08:19  mekwall: and no, my description was off
08:19  TonkaTruck: Haha...funny accent.  It's all relative.
08:20  mekwall: mattalexx: well, I recognize his voice based hon how he talks  :)
08:21  TonkaTruck: It's probably safe to say that everybody recognizes him by that...
08:21  mekwall: so if it's not his acccent, what is it?
08:22  TonkaTruck: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGPcSd7DDLk classic
08:22  hilko: it's more inflection
08:22  Funhouse: Hey guys, just wondering with the .get or .load, how would I show a loading images while the ajax is being called?
08:22  TonkaTruck: Yeah, it's totally inflection I agree.
08:22  hilko: I'd say accent implies that it's particular to a group of people
08:22  mattalexx: mekwall, He does have a unique way of anunciating words, I'll give you that,.
08:23  mattalexx: *enunciating

08:23  mahen23: hello all
08:23  mekwall: mattalexx: Swedish :)
08:23  mekwall: hurdyburdy
08:23  hilko: I'd say with Christopher Walken it's 90% cadence
08:24  mattalexx: mekwall, Well, then he has an accent then.
08:24  mahen23: what would cause a jpg to display in Firefox but not in IE7/8 ?
08:24  hilko: haha, good point mattalexx
08:24  mekwall: mattalexx: everyone has an accent :)
08:24  TonkaTruck: Also in that annie hall clip...his use of weirdly placed pauses...that's probably what's most recognizable.
08:24  hilko: yes, pauses too!
08:24  mekwall: mattalexx: it's just a matter of perspective
08:24  mekwall: I speak swedish, but with a Gothenburgian accent

08:26  devdrinker: is ajaxStop fired when a ajax call errors?
08:26  mekwall: devdrinker: it should
08:27  devdrinker: great
08:27  mahen23: anyone can help me?
08:27  mekwall: devdrinker: I'd say it depends on the error though, but I'm not certain :p
08:27 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
08:28  devdrinker: if it can get to the error callback and ajaxStop is called then thats fine, if its a syntax or other runtime error then i can accept it wont.
08:29  mekwall: devdrinker: .ajax is getting a real overhaul in 1.5 though
08:29  mekwall: it will be awesome!
08:29  devdrinker: whats coming?
08:29  mekwall: jXHR ;)
08:29  devdrinker: what the hell is jXHR?
08:30  mekwall: devdrinker: the jQuery XHR object
08:30  devdrinker: ah so we have an abstraction over the native xhr, before beforesend etc, to be honest I never have to tweak or check the native XHR
08:30  mekwall: indeed :)
08:31  mekwall: it's almost done... only docs are missing afaik
08:31  xotix: hi, yesterday evening i've made this with you help http://pastebin.com/x8ruGQFK it works, but i still dont now, why the 2nd div gets first when clicking on the button next.
08:31  devdrinker: a few more shortcut methods would be nice tho, and revamp of existing e.g. getJson failing silently if malformed
08:31  mekwall: and then deferreds, which will RULE
08:31  mekwall: joined deferreds :)
08:32  mekwall: devdrinker: you should have listened in on the weekly status meeting hehe
08:33  devdrinker: is that on this channel?

08:40  Jester831: can you have it send httponly cookies?
08:42  Jester831: I want to have an https httponly cookie to verify against a session code while submitting via ajax
08:42  Jester831: that possible?
08:44  blackspotwiggins: Jester831, it does send httponly cookies
08:45  blackspotwiggins: it is implicit
08:46  Jester831: nice, how do I view the data once submitted?
08:46  Jester831: is it just $_POST['cookie name']?

10:15  beevi7: guys, i'm looking for a javascript framework(?) i recently discovered. i dont remember the name but the main "functionality" was to choose certain functions from several other frameworks and build your "own" framework with it if i got it right
10:15  beevi7: any idea what i mean?
10:15  JKarsrud: Birliban: the event object that is passed to handlers
10:15  ss23: jQuery UI beevi7?
10:16  beevi7: no. it has nothing to do with jquery
10:16 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
10:16  JKarsrud: you can preventDefault(); it, to prevent the default event fom happening, or you can fetch the element that triggered the event etc.
10:16  Birliban: JKarsrud, could you give a short example, pls?
10:16  JKarsrud: console.log(e); inside that function
10:16  beevi7: if i understood it correctly you can "mix" frameworks like jquery, mootools, etc.. and create your own set of functions you really need
10:16  Birliban: JKarsrud, ok i see
10:16  Birliban: thanks
10:17  JKarsrud: to see in firebug/web inspector what you can use :)
10:17  beevi7: i think there was "js" at the end. similar to "node.js" or "ext.js".
10:18  Insilico: Hey, I'm trying to use the selector 'input[type="text"][value=""]' but it selects fields that have a value set... can anyone help? :)

10:18  beevi7: ?
10:20  atan2: I have <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">......</script> in my header but the validator says it doesn't have the required attr src. What's up with this, and how would I fix it without using an external file?
10:21  Insilico: beevi7: Won't that select elements where value!=""? I want element where value=""
10:22  iaj: hey:)) $('div[id^="slide"]').hide();   what's wrong about that selecting all divs whose id should start with slide ??
10:24  Altreus: oh fixed it - the 'modal' option overrides 'showCloseButton' but it only does it the *second* time you open it
10:24  Altreus: worth remembering
10:24  Altreus: I might tell them

10:42  batfastad: Hi everyone. I've just done a test upgrade from jquery-ui-1.7.2 to jquery-ui-1.8.7 on our intranet and everything seems to work fine... apart from a slight change in behaviour for tabs. When selecting a new tab, the tab is loaded but the screen is jumped to the top of the page. We have 8 tabs with their contents all loaded through AJAX. Is this a known thing?
10:42  batfastad: I'm going to setup a demo page with 1.8.8 shortly to see if I can replicate. Just wondered if someone was aware of a change in behaviour in the UI tabs
10:44 --- jeff_h is now known as jeff-h
10:45  batfastad: Ok a bit more information on this. Seems it only moves the page up when loading that tab for the first time. Subsequent loads the page remains where the user had it scrolled. This is in FF Win 3.6.13
10:45  blackspotwiggins: batfastad, you probably use # in the links
10:45  blackspotwiggins: prevent default behaviour on the links or remove # from anchors
10:46  sona: Trying to get the height of an element which is hidden with display:none, height() gives me 70px, but it should be well above 100px, any clues ?
10:46  johnline: helo
10:49  Back2Basics: thanks chrislabeard for answering my question. :)
10:49  unfo-: sona, .css({display: 'block'; 'margin-left': '-9999px'}).height(); then reset margin-left and display :)
10:49  chrislabeard: Back2Basics: Im sorry?
10:50  batfastad: blackspotwiggins: I don't have # in the links for the tabs
10:50  Back2Basics: I just asked before you came in how to add a class to an element  ( thinking that it was specific to the plugin I was using)  but in your code you are using $(this).addClass("current");
10:51  chrislabeard: ah yeah
10:51  chrislabeard: Back2Basics: Now i need to figure out how I can get this plugin to filter by classes not just ids
10:51  Back2Basics: this is something I use for your question.   http://vikaskhera.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/jquery12_colorcharge.png
10:52  Back2Basics: selecting by id should use $(#IDname)
10:52  sona: unfo-: is this a known issue that you can't get the height of an element with display: none ?
10:54  sona: this emans you can't use animate toggle on any elements that does not have a static height ?
10:55  sona: means
10:55  unfo-: sona, the browser cannot know the rendered height of an element before it is rendered
10:55  blackspotwiggins: sona, display:none does not have any height
10:55 @coldhead: it does not mean that
10:55 @coldhead: ?tias

10:57 --- fortysixandtwo_ is now known as fortysixandtwo
10:58  blackspotwiggins: well
10:58 @coldhead: unfo-: if it matters to you you can try showing()ing it offscreen and measuring the height there
10:58  blackspotwiggins: you cant see visibility:invisible either
10:58  blackspotwiggins: but you can measure its height because it is in the document flow
10:58 @coldhead: with margin-left:-9999999999em or similar
10:58  unfo-: if it is display:none it is not in the flow of the page, once you set display to block, inline, inline-block or whatever, the browser paints it and applies styles and then it has a height :)
10:58  unfo-: coldhead, --> sona
10:59  unfo-: coldhead, that's what i suggested from the get-go
10:59 @coldhead: or sorry
10:59 @coldhead: oh*
10:59 @coldhead: yes it's my first day using IRC
10:59  unfo-: :-D
10:59  hilko: I suppose you could also give it a class that is the height?
10:59 @coldhead: still getting the hang of it lol
10:59  Ely2: :D
10:59  ss23: lol
10:59  hilko: or store the height in some other way
10:59  ss23: Long day coldhead?
11:00 @coldhead: lol yes ss23
11:00  unfo-: hilko, works only if overflow is set, i suppose
11:00  sona: I see, I think I could get away with using display:block and overflow:hidden here as well.
11:00  Birliban: hi, could someone pls take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/Birliban/zasvq/4/ (question in comments)
11:00  blackspotwiggins: css horror
11:02  hilko: or set the z-index so it's behind everything else?
11:02 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
11:02  blackspotwiggins: how about not measuring height with js in the first place
11:02  Back2Basics: is the z-index of 1 in front or in back?
11:02  hilko: Back2Basics: well, it's all relative :P
11:02  blackspotwiggins: 95% times it is some bullshit to sidestep the real problem
11:02  hilko: or store the height in another css property!
11:03  hilko: that's what I'd do
11:03  hilko: but I don't think I'd run into this issue in the first place, really
11:03  hilko: blackspotwiggins: true

11:04  Back2Basics: Can you set the hight something like +10? (meaning: whatever you thing it is add 10px to it because that was you won't get a scrollbar)
11:04  hilko: so anyways, I'm looking for a jQuery plugin that makes a string of text follow the mouse.
11:04  Back2Basics: I was talking about a dialog hight.
11:04  hilko: and also perhaps makes text blink?
11:04  unfo-: hilko, the '90s called and want their effects back
11:05  Back2Basics: hilko: blink has been outlawed.
11:05  hilko: hehe, kidding
11:05  hilko: Back2Basics: are you saying that text following the mouse is not a problem?
11:05  blackspotwiggins: hey kids, try this, $("*").css("text-decoration", "blink")
11:05  blackspotwiggins: instant awesome
11:05  hilko: haha
11:06  Back2Basics: hilko: no I can think of some reasons (dislexia) where that could help.
11:06 @coldhead: dyslexia*
11:07  hilko: oo there should be dyslexia plugin that randomly switches letters in words and/or rewrites words incorrectly while being foneticalli identical
11:07  hilko: it'd be a hit
11:07  Back2Basics: stupid spell check.  I gotta add that one... with the asterisk
11:07  hilko: level the playing field
11:07  ss23: "foneticalli"
11:07  juha_: coldhead: is it simalar to diarrhea?
11:07  ss23: Did you do it yourself with that word?
11:07  blackspotwiggins: haha

11:08  hilko: no, we'd call it the dislexia pluign
11:08  hilko: or plugen
11:08  blackspotwiggins: imo atwood thinks 95% of stuff is awful :P
11:08  sean`: mr_frothy, jeff atwood is a prick
11:09  mr_frothy: yes I have flipped the bozo bit on him a few times now
11:09  hilko: pricks can be right though
11:09  hilko: it's sometimes hard to tell if someone is a prick and right, or just a prick contrarian
11:09  sona: blackspotwiggins: I need to animate the element to it's full size, I'd say js is needed.
11:09  hilko: sona: you could try flash maybe?
11:09  mr_frothy: i think he's a prick contrarian
11:10  sean`: hilko, 1) lotta top 1000 sites (alexa) use a cdn
11:10  blackspotwiggins: sona, how do you animate hidden elements?
11:10  sean`: so, it wouldn't slow you down
11:10  hilko: right
11:10  hilko: true
11:10  sean`: second of all, you don't need a large library
11:10  sona: blackspotwiggins: by height
11:10  sean`: you just need some basics
11:10  blackspotwiggins: o_o
11:10  hilko: maybe that's the problem? users either not doing that, or downloading the whole shebang
11:11  sean`: better download the whole shebang once, than download different combos every time
11:11  hilko: furthermore, I do sort of understand the argument of not wanting 'bloat', however irrelevant it might be in reality
11:11  hilko: like OCD
11:11  hilko: sean`: good point, forgot about that
11:11  Back2Basics: If you have a youtube player on the page, what sets the ytplayer variable?    (keeps saying its not defined)

11:12 @coldhead: in real reality everyone just uses facebook anyway, so there's no need to make any other sites
11:12  maholtz|WORK: i wonder why jQuery(document).ready(alert('works')); works, but jQuery(document).ready(function() {alert('does not work');}); does not work. Any hint?
11:12  hilko: I can remove much of it, but it won't really speed things up much, and might not be worth the effort.
11:12  hilko: still I do it
11:12 @coldhead: maholtz|WORK: the former should not work
11:12  Back2Basics: coldhead: WOW... I gotta try it then.
11:12 @coldhead: .ready() expects a functio
11:12  blackspotwiggins: coldhead, it works because it is evaluated
11:12 @coldhead: function
11:12 @coldhead: oh zuh

11:33  abracsi: Hi guys, is it common practice to load a page with many scripts, all of them providing functions to document.ready
11:33  ss23: Slower than doing it all at once
11:34  abracsi: ok. but usual if you're not sure which scripts you want to include on a page
11:34  hilko: is there a jquery script that changes color of an image?
11:34  hilko: a client insisted on an image-based menu
11:34  hilko: but it's in three languages so a lot of work to create two versions of each image
11:35  hilko: some kind of visual cue on hover would be nice though...
11:35  ss23: abracsi: o.o
11:35  ss23: But...
11:35  ss23: You always know what scripts you're going to have on a page
11:35  ss23: If you didn't know, how could you specificy them?
11:35  ss23: You're saying "I put XXX scripts on a page, without knowing what scripts I put on the page" o.O
11:35  blackspotwiggins: hilko, it is possible to manipulate images on canvas i suppose
11:35  blackspotwiggins: but that approach is extremely stupid
11:35  blackspotwiggins: for what you are trying to do
11:36  abracsi: ss23 lol fair point.
11:36  hilko: well, the only alternative is alternate hover images

11:36  abracsi: ss23 say you are only loading a script when the person is logged out
11:36  hilko: well, this client insisted
11:37  ss23: abracsi: Common doesn't matter. If it works, you can use it.
11:37  hilko: and I'd rather just do as he says than not make money :)
11:37  ss23: I'm just saying, it's slow
11:37  blackspotwiggins: well i insist on wooden wheels and a hamburger machine in the back seat
11:37  hilko: on the font, anyways
11:37  blackspotwiggins: chop chop
11:37  ss23: And the most immediate site performance increases are through things like that
11:37  hilko: well, I'd do it if you paid
11:37  hilko: and if I could make cars :)
11:37  hilko: anyways, I don't care so much about doing it right, because the site as it is is ugly
11:37  hilko: he also insisted on designing it himself
11:37  abracsi: ss23 ok suprised it's that much slower. what's the impact the loading of another script block? i would have thought the queue would be pretty fast?
11:37  hilko: I'd never take it on if  Ididn't need the money
11:38  abracsi: ss23, in terms of jQuery executing the code
11:38  ss23: Eh, idk

11:38  blackspotwiggins: hilko, let him design the images in all the possible colors then

11:46  beevi7: bad example
11:46  beevi7: i need any code to be executed before the script is loaded
11:47  blackspotwiggins: you cant execute the code you dont have
11:47  beevi7: the .css() was just an example to describe what i need ;)
11:47  russinkungen: hard to execute code when it's not loaded. having fouc issues?
11:48  beevi7: blackspotwiggins yes. but i already have the code. it's inside my domready.html document and the <script src="..."> is executed after my $(function() {});
11:48  blackspotwiggins: well domready is executed when all the dom has been parsed
11:48 --- JoshManders_ is now known as JoshManders
11:48  blackspotwiggins: you could execute stuff earlier, but you cant safely manipulate dom
11:50  beevi7: ok. and how can i execute it earlier? i would need something like window.addEventListener('onbeforedomready', function() {});
11:50  beevi7: the order of the alerts should be: "first alert", [wait for script], "dom ready event alert", "document loaded alert"
11:51  blackspotwiggins: there is no event
11:51  blackspotwiggins: just put alert("kaboom") somewhere

11:55  blackspotwiggins: yes
11:56  beevi7: well
11:56  beevi7: i can use createElement('script'); setAttribute('src', 'delay.php');
11:56  blackspotwiggins: beevi7, i TOLD you you cant manipulate dom
11:56  beevi7: then my domready fires before it's loade
11:57  beevi7: http://manuelbieh.com/upload/domready2.html
11:58  beevi7: that's what i needed
11:58  beevi7: ;)

11:58  beevi7: yep

12:01  Altreus: chrislabeard: I would just fiddle with the class attribute
12:02  blackspotwiggins: chrislabeard, arent classes case insensitive?
12:02  chrislabeard: blackspotwiggins: I need them to be lowercase for a script and i can't control the output of the classes
12:02  chrislabeard: I need to do this to them --- .toggleClass().toLowerCase().replace(' ','-');
12:02  blackspotwiggins: err
12:02  blackspotwiggins: whatever
12:02  chrislabeard: woops ignore the toggleclass
12:03  Altreus: Classes can't have a space in
12:03  Altreus: If there's a space, that's two separate classes
12:03  Altreus: that kinda defeats the point of having classes.
12:04  chrislabeard: Yeah I didn't quit think that through
12:05  Altreus: anyway I would do something like  $('div').each(function(i,obj) { obj.attr('class', obj.attr('class').toLowerCase()) })
12:05  Altreus: with appropriate semicolons

12:23  svenlito: but it doesnt seem to be available outside the ajax method
12:24  svenlito: anyone?
12:25  blackspotwiggins: svenlito, where exactly is it defined?
12:25  Altreus: svenlito: Are you sure it's not just that the ajax is async and you're using the searchresults before the ajax function has run?
12:26  blackspotwiggins: the part you pastied looks ok to me

Anyway, there is a situation when user can open index.html in that iframe. question - how can i detect such situation? I mean in case user wants to open index.html in iframe, detect it and simply change hist location to index.html
12:27  Altreus: All you're doing in the success function is building the array. You're not actually using the newly-built array anywhere...
12:27  Altreus: svenlito: Can you paste a wider chunk of code; specifically, including wherever it is you're trying to use it?
12:27  svenlito: Altreus: check line 26

12:29  blackspotwiggins: svenlito, when you use source: results it is empty
12:29  blackspotwiggins: you need to change the source function
12:29  Altreus: svenlito: Yes as I thought. Your ajax call doesn't *update* source to the new array :)
12:29  svenlito: yeah exactly, its empty.
12:29  Altreus: svenlito: Remember, it's not a reference to the array, it's a copy
12:30  svenlito: hm k
12:30  Altreus: When you add things to it, the one you set to source remains what it was at that time
12:30  svenlito: can you give me a hint
12:30  Altreus: So after your each(), you need to figure out how to set the source, and do so
12:30  Altreus: check the docs for your autocomplete plugin
12:31  blackspotwiggins: or
12:31  blackspotwiggins: you could set a custom source function
12:32  Altreus: or possibly you could set source to a function that returns the array!
12:32  svenlito: yeah, would be most handy i guess
12:32  Altreus: depends what the docs say
12:32  svenlito: retruning the array

13:21  reecefowell: anyone can tell me why when using jQuery UI when using the default theme or ui-darkness (not tried others) the font size is huge compared to what is shown on the theme-roller ?
13:22  ablomen: reecefowell, because the font-sizes are in em, set a font-size on the body
13:22  reecefowell: thanks ablomen
13:22  ablomen: otherwise it uses the default font size which is 16px most of the time
13:24  batfastad: Hi everyone. I'm trying out the UI tabs with jquery 1.8.8 but when I select a different tab, the user gets scrolled up to the top of the tabs. But once that tab has been loaded once already, the scroll doesn't happen. It's only for the first time a tab is loaded. This happens in FF, IE7 and Opera on Win XP. Is there a way to avoid the re-scrolling? Here's my test page... http://thenetzone.co.uk/fail/
13:24  reecefowell: so just edit the theme to set a manual size?
13:24 --- JoshManders_ is now known as JoshManders

13:29  reecefowell: just want the widget size changed
13:29  reecefowell: :/
13:29  ablomen: and otherwise, yes you can try overwriting the ui classes

13:30  reecefowell: how do i do that then?

13:31  AnthonyCat: Hey, does jquery make JSON.stringify() work?
13:31  ablomen: well you can, but i wouldn't, just put something like .ui-widget { font-size: 12px; } in your css
13:32  AnthonyCat: If not, what should I use instead?
13:33  ablomen: AnthonyCat, you can use the build in version in newer browsers and load json2.js (json.org) in case of older browsers
13:34  AnthonyCat: ablomen: I was wondering if jQuery already did that, instead of loading it separately.

15:41  Pascal_: How can i get the height of a DIV element when its display:none at the moment. I can show it, get the height, hide it again...  but thats not really an option i believe
15:41  gramena: malev1:  either $form.find('.something') or $.find('.something', $form)
15:41  malev1: gramena: I'm gonna check it. thanks!!
15:42  malev1: gramena: works!!! thanks dude!!
15:42  rcpeterson: Pascal: I think .css("height") gives you an explicit height, if it has been set, as opposed to .height(), which always gives you calculated height. I might be wrong.
15:43  gramena: malev, Actually I ment to type the last example $('.something', $form)

15:55  mblumenstingl: hi
15:55  mblumenstingl: I've short question: we're trying to implement drag and drop functionality with jQuery
15:55  mblumenstingl: unfortunately it's pretty slow in internet explorer :(
15:56  mblumenstingl: we used IE's profiling tool and it looks like ui.droppable's _create function is the cause
15:56  mblumenstingl: according to IE's profiler this method takes almost 7 seconds to run
15:56  mblumenstingl: we got 140 droppable elements on our page
15:57  koichirose: Hi, I'm trying to have an array of all checked values in a form. This is my attempt. I have the correct number of 'checked' elements, but they are all the same as the last one clicked. http://pastebin.com/cDG2EgWF
15:57  russinkungen: mblumenstingl: are you caching the elements or iterating over the dom every time you manipulate them by calling $('selector')?
15:58  ehynds: koichirose, $('input:checkbox:checked').map(function(){ return this.value; }).get();
15:58  koichirose: ehynds, ok. What about the not checked? is there a pseudo selector too?
15:58  Mongin: Hi
15:59  Mongin: any ETA for jQuery 1.5 final ?
15:59  ehynds: koichirose, :not(:checked).  1 sec
15:59  mblumenstingl: russinkungen: I don't think we're caching them. in jQuery's ready event we're calling "jQuery('div[id=dropable]').droppable({ ... })" - but that's the only place we're selecting our droppable elements
16:01  ehynds: koichirose, try this http://pastie.org/1473656
16:02 --- zog-zZzZZ is now known as _zoggy_
16:03  mblumenstingl: russinkungen: not sure if it helps, but I had a look at jQuery's source (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js#L42) - line 42 may be the cause, since (according to the profiler) addClass, isFunction and Array.push take less than 50ms (together), but the whole _create() function needs 6500ms. The only call that may be "expensive" in _create() may be the one in line 42
16:03  koichirose: ehynds, wow, that's awesome :) thanks
16:04  phrearch: hi
16:05  koichirose: ehynds, I don't really understand the final .get() . The result is correct though. I would actually prefer a string
16:05  phrearch: im trying to modify this superfish plugin to work with divs that have a data-function attribute, instead of a elements. any idea where it needs to be changed? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/322715/
16:05  ehynds: koichirose, without the final get() it would still be a jquery object.  the get makes it an array of just the results
16:05  ehynds: if you want a string, then call join()
16:06  koichirose: ehynds, yes, after I have the results I can call join. I was wondering if I can do it within map(). I can do it for the unchecked (unchecked += ' '+this.value instead of push() ) but what about the checked?
16:07  nitrospectide: is there a jquery technique that lets me mimic the Flash style group photo rollover with data overlay boxes... but not using Flickr style rectangular live areas - using the contoured silhouette outline live rollover area instead?
16:07  ehynds: koichirose, join() is much cleaner
16:07 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
16:07  ehynds: koichirose, that code creates two arrays, one unchecked and one checked.  join them both
16:07  koichirose: ehynds, ok. I thought it would have been better to do it within the map()
16:07  ehynds: negative
16:08  ehynds: map() creates a new array

16:09  aurilliance: Am I correct in thinking one starts in <= 30 mins?
16:09  mblumenstingl: russinkungen: I just opened my page in firefox - firebug's profiler tells me _create only takes 120ms there
16:10  russinkungen: hmm ok, not sure what might be the issue. I ended up in a skype conference here.
16:17  koichirose: ehynds, here's what I'm trying to do: I have something like 10 checkboxes, with values. Then a list of <li> with classes (same as checkboxes values). I'm trying to hide and show <li>s based on the checked/unchecked checkboxes. Any suggestions? here's my code: http://pastebin.com/S8j61b13
16:18  koichirose: This is actually working, but only the unchecking part. When I check a checkbox, it says: "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ." even though the code looks the same to me...
16:19  ehynds: why not find which checkboxes are unchecked, grab their parent() li item, and hide() it?
16:19  ehynds: $(':checkbox').show().filter(':not(:checekd)').closest('li').hide();
16:19  ehynds: something like that
16:20  koichirose: ehynds, the checkbox and the list are completely separated.
16:20  ehynds: lame
16:20  ehynds: yeah.. joining them like that doesn't produce a valid selector
16:21  koichirose: I have <checkbox value="something"><checkbox value="something_else"> *some other elements* <ul><li class="something"></li><li class="something something_else"></li></ul>
16:21  koichirose: ehynds, it's working when I uncheck though :O
16:22  timmywil: koichirose: can you just use indexes
16:22  timmywil: if they line up
16:22  ehynds: koichirose, have you console.log()'d the arrays and see what they look like?
16:22  koichirose: yes, they look correct.

16:25  abracsi_: guys, using ajax to get datatype:'json'.... but what i get back is a string.. not an object?
16:25  abracsi_: it's a string containing the json
16:26  abracsi_: do i have to eval it? or am i missing a config option or something?
16:26  koichirose: gnarf, yes. and hide/show the <li>s that have every checked/unchecked class
16:26  gnarf: only all the classes?
16:26  gnarf: not one of them?

16:29  koichirose: sean``, I don't really understand  your example
16:29  mblumenstingl: weird, regarding our slow dragging problem: we're seeing two issues there, both related to some "offset" calculating in drag 'n drop events - it seems to be VERY slow in IE
16:29  Kambfhase: abracsi_: or try dataType with capital T
16:29 --- blueadept is now known as Guest14287
16:30  timmywil: koichirose: he's using html5 data to link the elements attaching which selector you need
16:30  mblumenstingl: this.proportions = { width: this.element[0].offsetWidth, height: this.element[0].offsetHeight }; <-this line (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js#L39) takes ~6000ms to execute in IE8
16:30  timmywil: pretty much how the jquery data link plugin works
16:30  koichirose: timmywil, yes, but it's not working here
16:30  mblumenstingl: when we're actually dragging there's prepareOffsets called somewhere, which takes almost 500ms, and fix() takes 300ms - this makes the drag experience not that great ;)
16:31  abracsi_: oh man. that's the problem, :-S thanks for the third time Kambfhase
16:31  Kambfhase: :)
16:31  gnarf: koichirose: can you describe the behavior a bit more?
16:31  Kambfhase: those small mistakes are the hardest to find.
16:32  gnarf: currently, it only hides elements that match all of the unchecked boxes
16:32  gnarf: and only shows em if they match all
16:32  gnarf: which seems, well, backwards
16:32  koichirose: gnarf, I got it: I have color:red, size:large. then elements like <li class="large"><li class="large red">. Unchecking red and large hides them both. rechecking red shows 'large red' even though 'large' is unchecked.
16:33  gnarf: koichirose: okay, so you want the li items to be shown if they match any of the classes from the checked list right?
16:33  gnarf: how long is this list?
16:33  koichirose: it is *quite* long. that's another problem

16:34  gnarf: wait

16:34  gnarf: red was checked
16:34  gnarf: bug "large red" was shown
16:34  gnarf: er but
16:35  koichirose: gnarf, if I hide/show using your 'any' method:  Unchecking red and large hides them both. rechecking red shows 'large red' even though 'large' is unchecked.
16:35  gnarf: koichirose: and you don't want that?
16:36  koichirose: no
16:36  gnarf: which tells me you want to hide any that match unchecked the
16:36  koichirose: it's a filter. if large is unchecked it can't show me elements with 'large'
16:36  koichirose: hide, yes. show, no.
16:36  gnarf: k
16:37  koichirose: actually, I could reduce to one array. uncheck: hide all elements with unchecked class. check: show elements with every checked class

16:41  rahmen: Hi! I've managed to make a nice autocomplete script that searches for a name and if it's selected the script fills in known data in the remaining fields. I've got over 4000 searchresults so this makes the page a bit laggy. I'm looking for a way to get the data from an url instead since I think that will reduce the loading time.. So I found this http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8rc3/demos
16:41  rahmen: /autocomplete/remote.html But this doesn't work for me.. can anyone tell me if the code is correct or maybe link me another example?
16:41  gnarf: maybe that approach will get you somewhere
16:42  koichirose: gnarf, yes. I just realized that I have to show elements *not* with unchecked classes. Instead of elements with *all* checked classes (that would be none).

17:31  Brodingo: it might be quite doesnt matter
17:32  aleray: eternicode, I'm wondering how I can pass arguments to my methods, and if there is a way to make a reference to the pagniation object instead of calling the element first, like this $this.pagination("update"); (see line 73 http://dpaste.com/329571/)
17:32  aleray: sorry if my questions are stupid
17:32  aleray: just try to get the logic
17:33  gnarf: aleray: you can set .data('pagination') as the instance of your widget
17:33  gnarf: then have functions to call on it
17:35  aleray: gnarf, thanks. It's maybe just because I'm not used to but if find the logic strange :-P
17:35  aleray: but if you say this is the way to do it why not
17:35  gnarf: aleray its one way to do it
17:36  aleray: gnarf, do you know other ways, just by curiosity?
17:36  gnarf: have you looked at the ui widget factory?
17:36  eternicode: aleray, line 83 is where you're passing the extra arguments to the specified method.
17:36  gnarf: or are you not using ui on this?
17:36  eternicode: return methods[ method ].apply( this, Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ));
17:36  gnarf: "Array.prototype" can be shortened to []
17:36  aleray: gnarf, I'm not using ui
17:37  gnarf: aleray: jQuery.type(mehot) === 'object' on line 84
17:37  gnarf: safer

17:54  mekwall: c0derz: isn't it just easier to change your PHP to accomodate for that variable?
17:55  c0derz: mekwall: No because I would like to use one php file for multiple autocompleted form
17:56  mekwall: c0derz: where did you get the plugin?
17:56  c0derz: from official webpage
17:56  c0derz: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete
17:56  Forbidd3n: anyone know how I can make a clean url with js as the user is typing in the page title - for instance - Energy Savings would turn into energy-savings
18:00  c0derz: mekwall: I know it's possible to split the q variable to do what I want
18:00  c0derz: I would to know it's possible to change it on jquery script

18:04  thepacmanfan: right now the popup closes if the cursor leaves the target, but i want the user to be able to hold their mouse over the popup and have it remain open
18:05  mekwall: Bigsista: it's a problem.... this happens nearly everyday...

18:22  diamonds: there's an image, a position...
18:22  diamonds: a repeat value
18:23  gnarf: diamonds: backgroundImage
18:23  toastyghost: i think you maybe have to grab them separately if you need all of them
18:23  gnarf: backgroundPosition
18:23  diamonds: gnarf: so 1x1?
18:23  diamonds: ok
18:23  toastyghost: which is probably less resource-intensive than parsing a shorthand string yourself, anyway
18:23  kojiro: it would certainly make for more readable code

18:31  diamonds: sounds like not
18:34  kojiro: you can set css with jquery. Any css. but should you? It's often better to toggle attributes like class and apply CSS to the class.

In my case, even tough $('#elementName') is not on DOM, an error comes up, because the script seems to run.
19:18  Shwaiil: Any tip ? Thanks

20:21  jinxdone2: dekhaus, the element that was clicked will be the current context.. you can get the jQuery of it like so..  $(this)
20:21  timmywil: dekhaus: Should already be like that.  the alert should only fire for the link that was clicked.
20:22  timmywil: dekhaus: if you're calling the click handler with js, that's another story, need to make sure you are selecting only one link
20:22  dekhaus: not so.  If i add 'alert($(this));' - i get two alerts - when the page has two links.   I obviously only clicked on one.   I need to see only one alert
20:23  timmywil: dekhaus: is one of these links inside the other perchance?
20:23  dekhaus: timmywil - no.   two separate links - of the same class

21:26  nullobj: but it does not work
21:26  khmer: given: var container = $('div#somecontainer')
21:26  nullobj: and I don't know how to iterate between all occurrences
21:27  serio: ?.offset @ nullobj
21:27  bot-t: nullobj, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/

21:27  khmer: or var subsections = $('div#somecontainer .subsec')
21:27  serio: khmer, check on jsperf?
21:27  timmywil: first one
21:27  serio: my guessw ould be the second.
21:27  khmer: perhaps i will!
21:28  timmywil: you're saying container is already an object?
21:28  eternicode: nullobj, firstly, $('.MyAppHighlight') (note the dot).  Secondly, using .offset() on a multi-object query won't work for the 2nd and further objects.
21:28 --- alessio_alex01 is now known as alessio_alexAFK
21:28  khmer: timmywil: yeah, given that var container = $('div.#somecontainer')

21:29  initself: i have a suspicion that my jQuery UI is incompatible with my jQuery.
21:29  nullobj: eternicode okay I'll use MyAppHighlight1, MyAppHighlight2 and so on
21:29  nullobj: it should work fine
21:29  timmywil: but tags with classes

21:29  initself: does that sound right?
21:29  khmer: timmywil: i just assumed efficiency would increase as a function of selector specificity
21:29  serio: yeah, use .each in conjunction with .offset
21:30  khmer: timmywil: why is that?
21:30  jinxdone2: khmer i would assume the fastest is container.find('.subsec') or $('.subsec', container)
21:30  etcetera_: anyone have a "search" icon for a jquery mobile data-icon?
21:30  jinxdone2: since you already have the div#somecontainer no need to look it up again from dom
21:30  ajpiano: initself: there's nothing right about using jquery 1.4.1
21:30  timmywil: khmer: jQuery reads left to right.  when you include the tag name, it maps to getElementsByTagName first, ifyou just do the id, it maps directly to getElementById
21:30  timmywil: so it's quite a bit faster
21:30  initself: something about upgrading breaks other plugins
21:31  initself: i can't risk messing with that right now
21:31  timmywil: it's actually sizzle, but regardless

21:31 --- nbari|away is now known as nbari
21:31  timmywil: idk, sizzle is a beast
21:31  serio: initself, you should use a deprecated version of jQuery UI to go with your deprecated version of jQuery
21:31  initself: which one, tho?
21:32  initself: how far back do i go?
21:32  khmer: timmywil: i haven't looked at sizzle but i guess i figured the first thing it would do would be to parse the selector for an ID and then grab that ID, then continue
21:32  ajpiano: initself: the current version is jQuery 1.4.4 with UI 1.8.8
21:32  initself: so decrement by 1?
21:32  ajpiano: huh
21:32  ajpiano: there's no magical formula to figure out compatibility
21:32  initself: so 1.4.1 goes with 1.8.5 ?
21:32  ajpiano: why do you want to use 1.4.1
21:32  ajpiano: you shouldn't ues it
21:33  initself: like i said, when i upgrade, there is a plugin that i use all over the place that breaks
21:33  initself: i don't have time to figure that out right now
21:33  ajpiano: sounds like you have that problem right now anyway bro
21:33  initself: i've spent hours on it already and downgrading fixed me
21:33  khmer: are you gonna have the time later
21:33  serio: but you have time to figure out with version of jQuery UI goes with your deprecated version of jQuery?
21:33  ajpiano: at least upgrade to 1.4.2
21:34  ajpiano: 1.4.1 was not a stable release
21:34  initself: that's the part that breaks it

22:41  coachz: and that url is a page that has javascript includes, that should work right ?
22:41  tocka: how to count divs ?
22:41  lucasw: maybe slider was the incorrect term, but more like a carousel that allows you to slide divs and other tags

22:42  coachz: no
22:42  timmywil: i don't know what dialog does

23:17  coachz: simple things are a pita
23:17  jastor: coachz: $("#box").width();
23:17  jastor: coachz: $("#box").height();
23:18  littulb_: what are good uses for the .load() function?????
23:18  coachz: i see
23:18  timmywil: jastor: don't say it's stupid.  top:50% is not what you want
23:18  tocka: jinxdone2, so how should the code look like ?
23:18  jastor: timmywil: its the same as your left:50%
23:18  timmywil: that will center vertically according to document, if the document is larger than the window, it will be farther down than you want
23:18  timmywil: no it's not
23:19  jinxdone2: tocka $('div:odd')
23:19  jastor: hmm ..
23:19  jastor: timmywil: youre probably right .. havent needed to center with css in a while ;)
23:19  jinxdone2: will get odd divs.. that's the easy way
23:19  coachz: dialog has  position:  'top',  how do i drop it 100px down in the dialog properties ?
23:19  coachz: or can it not be done there
23:19  jastor: timmywil: ah right .. forgot about the outer div
23:20  timmywil: coachz: you know, this may all be moot, i bet this dialog plugin has options for this
23:20  timmywil: but i haven't used it
23:20  coachz: i didn't want to add a plugin
23:20  coachz: what's the name of it
23:20  coachz: i'll see if it's already loaded
23:20  coachz: oh you mean dialog
23:20  timmywil: yea dialog
23:21  coachz: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
23:21  tocka: jinxdone2 thanks
23:21  tocka: :)
23:21  coachz: it allows an array for position
23:22  coachz: but that's fixed
23:22  coachz: it has center though, i'll try that
23:22  timmywil: looks like you can set it to center
23:22  timmywil: yea
23:22  coachz: tada !
23:22  coachz: thx,  i knew jQuery thought of everything
23:22  timmywil: there we go, sorry for the confusion
23:23  coachz: hehe
23:23  coachz: i'm loving it

23:42  timmywil: bleen_work: actually, my company wrote that, and we wrote it from scratch, as it scrolls you detach the dom and put it back on before it makes it back on the page…don't know of a plugin for it  =)
23:42  bleen_work: coldhead: hehe … no … I mean that if I click any of the buttons on the left the canvas switches … if I keep clicking buttons the canvas keeps switching, but *always* in teh up direction

23:46  coachz: nope, it popped under with  stack: true
23:46  coldhead: coachz: try fiddling with the z-index in firebug
23:46  coachz: yea i was hoping the dialog itself had the power though
23:46  coldhead: if you find one that works try adding  that with the onShow handler or some such
23:46  coachz: thank you coldhead

23:49  coldhead: i think they might be busy checking out kosher hotdog website though
23:49  coachz: i can't blame them
23:49  coldhead: coachz: maybe check the UI demos?
23:49  coldhead: maybe you're doing it wrong
23:49  coachz: likely, do they have stacking demos ?
