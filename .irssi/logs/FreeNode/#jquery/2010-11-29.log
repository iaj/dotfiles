08:26  Pawka: How should I catch event, when user clicks outside my element?
08:26 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 111 seconds
08:26  Cork: $(window).one('click.myevent', function() {});
08:26  Pawka: what is one?
08:27  Cork: same as bind, but only for one event
08:27  Cork: *one event execution
08:27  jrockjiggz: who's Jayson? and why is he so important?
08:27  Pawka: got it, thx.
08:27  Jarda: ?.one
08:27  bot-t: .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
08:27  Pawka: jrockjiggz, JSON, not jayson :-)
08:27  jrockjiggz: obvi just trolling
08:28  Pawka: jrockjiggz, it is some way to serialize an object.
08:28  jrockjiggz: :D
08:28  Pawka: ok.
08:28  Pawka: :-)
08:31  jrockjiggz: hey, with $(window).one('click.myevent'.. what exactly is myevent reffering to?
08:31  Third3ye: I can't seem to get the functions in my js to apply for a section of the page i used .load to fetch
08:31  Pawka: namespace.
08:31  jrockjiggz: i've never seen this dot notation in the event name
08:32  jrockjiggz: Third3ye: u may need to load with functions with data, or use getScript
08:32  Pawka: jrockjiggz, later if you want to unbint specific event, but not all 'click' events, you can provide event with namespace in such way.
08:32  Pawka: *unbind.
08:32  jrockjiggz: hmm - is there maybe an example somewhere?
08:32  jrockjiggz: but the only event i know to use is 'click'
08:32  Third3ye: jrockjiggz: how about sneaking a <script> in to the php file? To cheap?
08:33  jrockjiggz: Third3ye - that will work
08:33  jrockjiggz: i'm not advising anything :)
08:34  Pawka: jrockjiggz, dno. but for example if $('#id').unbind('click') removes all related click events. while .unbind('click.myevent') removes only current.
08:35  jrockjiggz: current...
08:35  jrockjiggz: current selector?
08:36  Pawka: current event. I mean 'click.myevent', which you have binded before.
08:36  jrockjiggz: ok
08:36  jrockjiggz: so the event will still behave like click, but your adding a name to it to identify the event
08:37  Pawka: exactly
08:37  jrockjiggz: so you can trigger('click.myevent')
08:37  jrockjiggz: cool. learned something new
08:38  Pawka: yes, you can trigger by namespace too.
08:38  Cork: and ontop of that if you want to remove it you can just do unbind('click.myevent')
08:38  Cork: and it would only remove your event, and not all click events
08:39  Cork: (thats the main reason i added it)
08:39  jrockjiggz: i don't unbind in my code..
08:40  jrockjiggz: haven't needed to..
08:40  Cork: jrockjiggz: in this case it could be that you don't need/want to trigger the off element click, so you want ot cancel the listner
08:41  jrockjiggz: i can see this coming useful
08:42  Cork: jrockjiggz: sidenote though, you want to do stopPropagation in your click even from your element, else everything will trigger the window.click event
08:42  Cork: (and you only want outside)
08:43  jrockjiggz: although, there is nothing propagating on a window.click

08:43  LearnerJq: i am using jquery UI dialog to ajaxly populate the dialog with a webform.. but infact i get varying numbers of dialogs rather than just one..like 3 or 4 or 2..i have used alert for testing purpose so the same numbers of alerts as well...this is my code kindly help me please http://pastebin.com/tifCQr1T
08:44  Cork: jrockjiggz: no i meant $('div').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); $(this).css('background-color', 'blue'); $(window).one('click.myevent', function() { $('div').css('background-color', 'transparent'); }); });
08:44  LearnerJq: and the reason why i am using live is..that infact the dialogue link as well is also what actually i get via ajax...so normal click method was not working
08:45  Cork: jrockjiggz: if you don't stop the propagation in the div event you don't have an outside my element event, it will be an "anywhere" event)

08:49  Cork: LearnerJq: is it intentional that your doing the dialog option outside your ajax callback?
08:49  Cork: ahhh sorry miss read
08:50  LearnerJq: Cork:ok....and i read your question 5 or 6 times lol
08:51  Cork: LearnerJq: but your code doesn't create a dialog, it just selectes the class .survey
08:51  Cork: LearnerJq: your sure you don't have multible instances of ".survey"?
08:51  Cork: what does $('.survey').length show?
08:51  LearnerJq: Cork:no on line 23 it opens the dialog
08:52  jrockjiggz: lightharut: I don't know if this will help - this will convert your array to json http://jsfiddle.net/tCQKX/
08:52  LearnerJq: let me check ur code
08:53  Superman_: hi guys
08:53  Cork: LearnerJq: cause that line only opens the dialogs, but if your selectors select multible elements, you will get multible copies of your dialogs (with contents)
08:53  LearnerJq: Cork: i have just one instance..confirmed
08:54  Cork: LearnerJq: and no .survey in the ajax responce?
08:54  Superman_: firefox bug: scrollHeight and .height() isn't working.
08:55  Superman_: :(

08:55  Superman_: cork can you take a look on that fiddle
08:55  otakutaku: http://pastebin.com/QPhDDkCc  <- am I using the .find method correctly?
08:56  LearnerJq: Cork:infact .survey comes up with ajax response...because that is why i am using live function..
08:57  Cork: LearnerJq: if so the error comes from outside the snippet you posted
08:57  Cork: LearnerJq: the code thats add .survey is whats interesting then
08:58  Cork: *that adds
08:58  lightharut: Cork:thanks for the link (json.org)
09:00  Cork: Superman_: scrollHeight - height() will only get you the negative height you've scrolled from the top
09:01  Cork: Superman_: not sure what your trying to do
09:01  Cork: gah sorry
09:01  Superman_: I'm trying to scroll up the images and down
09:01  Cork: thats scrollTop i'm mixing things up...
09:02  Superman_: and these images are coming from db
09:02  Superman_: so dynamic content and its working fine in chrome
09:02  LearnerJq: Cork: well nothing outside my code?
09:02  Superman_: but not in firefox
09:03  Cork: LearnerJq: its most likly your code, so lets start looking there :)
09:05  LearnerJq: well Cork: now the .length is showing 2 or 3 as well where the dialogs are opening more than one time..so u are right that it has to be more instances of the .survey...
09:05  LearnerJq: but...... i see none for now..
09:05  Cork: LearnerJq: neither can i untill you show me the code...
09:06  LearnerJq: ok
09:07  Cork: Superman_: anyway i get 307 when i log the scrollHeight, so it looks like it works like it should
09:07  Superman_: but if you check it in chrome you'll get different height which is accurate.

09:13  LearnerJq: in the first part infact i am fetching data a pagination table via ajax...which is doing fine.. from line 165 the code which i showed you starts
09:16  Cork: LearnerJq: if you disable the ajax call in the dialog, do you get multible dialogs then?
09:19  LearnerJq: let me check
09:24  iszak: Anyhow, my rage is over.
09:24  Superman_: how to scroll thumbs. I need to know the mathematical formula. :(
09:24  LearnerJq: cork: yes still i get multiple dialogs if i disable ajax even
09:25  JKarsrud: iszak: What was the problem?
09:25  JKarsrud: Superman_: What do you mean scroll thumbs?

09:29  iszak: Probably was OTT tho.

09:30  Superman_: no its not correct in firefox
09:30 --- zemacsh is now known as xrn
09:30  Superman_: but in chrome its working fine. In FF its not returning height of all thumbs.
09:31  JKarsrud: Ahh, no it's not. Seems firefox only returns the height of the visible height
09:31  Superman_: yea it seems like that
09:31  Superman_: is there any other way to scroll them
09:32  JKarsrud: how come you set it to 30px in the css?
09:32  Superman_: its just to hold things up within the scrolling path

09:50  oren: JKarsrud: since it's not doing the css changes i made to the html.
09:51  oren: maybe my injected code is the problem. is there a way to look at the new html?
09:51  oren: (view source shows me the old html)
09:52  JKarsrud: oren: You should use firebug all the time anyway
09:52  oren: oh. inspect elemnt in chrome shows me the html
09:52  JKarsrud: Yeah, that too
09:52  oren: yeah, firebug is a good suggestions

09:58  unfo-: hmmmh this answer in Stack Overflow implies that jQuery 1.4.2 sometimes has problems with AJAX requests receiving a 302 response: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call/3814117#3814117 -- anyone know if there is merit to this comment?
09:58  JKarsrud: oren: Probably not
09:59  oren: JKarsrud: the list is open when the html is injected, and there are no icons, so i assume the jquery didn't apply there.
09:59  oren: JKarsrud: it's only working on the first hit on the page. without the ajax.
10:00  JKarsrud: Then add the css etc. where you add the element to the DOM then
10:01  JKarsrud: unfo-: Is that a problem, now that 1.4.4 is out? :)
10:01  oren: JKarsrud: it's a list of nested items. whenever item has childrens, i display a + sign and the user can click to open it.

10:26  trollboy: Its not hard, but its a lot of little things
10:26  trollboy: lets focus on one particular aspect at a time
10:26  Jeff_Chew: now i tried using the script
10:26  Jeff_Chew: and i having problem on it
10:26  trollboy: that bydust is a library.. and libraries by their nature are collections of smaller things...
10:27  Jeff_Chew: so thats why i fedup and want to learn n make one
10:27  trollboy: so bydust is actually tons of things
10:27  trollboy: and you should have your own tons of things too
10:27  Jeff_Chew: i see
10:27  trollboy: so lets start with thing #1
10:27  trollboy: which part of that do you want first
10:27  trollboy: remember you have to walk before you can run

10:29  Jeff_Chew: haha sorry
10:29  trollboy: I'd prefer to chat here, but go ahead
10:29  zeddej: the value im trying to JSON.stringify is basically a php array which i have json_encode()
10:30  zeddej: JSON.stringify(<?php json_encode($php_array);?>);
10:30  zeddej: so thats wrong?
10:30  zeddej: and if so, why does it work just fine in firefox and chrome?
10:31  JKarsrud: why do you stringify an already json encoded string?
10:31  JenniferB2: is it possible to bind something to fire first ? elemet.click(function () { // do something 1 } ) .. later .. element.click(function() { // do somthing before the first bind }) ?? I am not talking about binding in a certain order..

10:35  Third3ye: JKarsrud, Cork: That little addition to .ajax part (data: { form: $('#contactForm').serializeArray(), goto: $forwhom }), it changes my post, and included "name" (where the heck did that come from?) Heres what post gives me: http://pastie.org/1331910
10:35  zeddej: i dont know why it becomes an object
10:35  zeddej: since i call json_encode on it?
10:38  zeddej: http://www.kokonniemi.fi/varaus/courselisting.php
10:38  zeddej: can you guys have a look
10:38  zeddej: if u inspect the buttons
10:38  zeddej: u can see the onclick parameters
10:38  zeddej: selectCourse(492,{"2010-12-26 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-27 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-28 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-29 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-30 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-31 12:00:00":" 13:40:00"})
10:38  zeddej: thats JSON i see as the second parameter, however when i click the button, this should happend:
10:39  zeddej: $(location).attr('href','newCourseBooking.php?course='+first+'&times='+second);
10:39  zeddej: but this is the URL that it goes to: http://www.kokonniemi.fi/varaus/newCourseBooking.php?course=479&times=[object%20Object]
10:39  zeddej: how does {"2010-12-26 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-27 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-28 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-29 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-30 12:00:00":" 13:40:00","2010-12-31 12:00:00":" 13:40:00"} suddenly become an object?
10:39  JKarsrud: because it's an object and not a string
10:40  zeddej: how do i turn it into a string then
10:40  Cork: zeddej: add it to the data section in the ajax call
10:41  Cork: jquery does the rest if you do
10:41  zeddej: uhm, its $(location)
10:41  zeddej: i cant set data to that can i ?
10:41  hariom: I have N parameters to pass (where N can be 2 or 3 or 4 values depending upon the request) to the server. I am firing a getJSON request and in the parameters list, I want to pass this. But as the N is not fixed, how can I pass parameters to the server?
10:42  Cork: ?.getJSON
10:42  bot-t: jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
10:42  hariom: Is there any way to pass JSON encoded data to the server?
10:43  Cork: hariom: add it to the data section instead
10:43  zeddej: hey, Cork how do i set data to the $(location) ?
10:44  hariom: Cork: I guess you didn't get the question. How to pack N parameters into a single entity? As I don't have fixed number of parameters to pass, I will need either some array to pass or encode them in JSON and pass.
10:44  James13433`: What is the best way to ensure the whole page has loaded before running more code?
10:44  Cork: hariom: data: {key1: 'value', key2: 'value', keyN: 'value' }
10:45  trollboy: James13433`,  $(document).ready(function() {  //do stuff }
10:45  Cork: hariom: or data: { arr: [1,2,3,4,5,6] } if you prefer
10:45  trollboy: err
10:45  trollboy: James13433`,  $(document).ready(function() {  //do stuff });
10:45  hariom: Cork: I don't know before hand how many key1, key2 ... are going to be there.
10:45  James13433`: thanks, trollboy
10:45  Cork: hariom: so just create the object dynamically...
10:45  hariom: I just want to pass all the select options selected on a form.
10:46  Cork: sigh...
10:46  hariom: I tried something like $('select').serializeArray()
10:46  hariom: but what I get at the server is object and I can't see values passed in firebug
10:47  nlogax: if you just use serialize() you will get a string fit for GETing or POSTing
10:48  zeddej: seriously
10:48  hatseflats: anyone? Multiple observers on the same property?
10:48  thestream: how do you post a form without refreshing the page after the button is clicked?
10:48  zeddej: stupid god damn JSON
10:48  zeddej: cant i force it to become a string somehow
10:48  themiddleman_: JSON.stringify
10:48  zeddej: i mean the value i see in my onClick parameter is just what i want to pass on
10:48  zeddej: <themiddleman_> JSON.stringify <- JSON IS UNDEFINED
10:48  Lumpio-: OH NO
10:48  Lumpio-: CALL THE JSON AMBULANCE
10:49  themiddleman_: ?g json2.js @ zeddej

10:52  sean`: omg
10:52  sean`: IE8 supports JSON
10:52  sean`: EVERYTHING supports JSOn
10:52  sean`: It's just a string
10:52  zeddej: well not this IE 8
10:52  zeddej: http://www.kokonniemi.fi/varaus/courselisting.php
10:52  zeddej: just try it
10:52  zeddej: with IE 8
10:52  zeddej: also i have included json2.js
10:52  zeddej: as u can see from the source
10:54  nlogax: alert('IMPORTANT: Remove this line from json2.js before deployment.'); :D

10:55  juha___: javsacript rules!
10:55  zeddej: ok thx
10:55  zeddej: but then this happends:

10:56  zeddej: it replaces '&times=' with 'x=' ?
10:57  zeddej: lol that makes no sense O-o
10:58  clu3: hi all, anyone know how to set dateformat to , like, "2010/11/29" for the jquery.datepicker plugin?
10:59  jomofcw: Hello =)
11:00  zeddej: but that doesn't happend in firefox or chrome
11:00  zeddej: only IE
11:00  zeddej: what the hell :D
11:00  unfo-: zeddej, i am guessing the x comes from the button tag and where the x/y coords of the mouse were when the click event happened
11:00  zeddej: why is it caching that? O_o
11:01  unfo-: zeddej, try using a div instead of a button for a test.
11:02  zeddej: unfo-:
11:02  zeddej: same thing
11:02  unfo-: $( "button").button();
11:02 --- sveimac_ is now known as sveimac
11:02  unfo-: ^ what does that do
11:03  jomofcw: Not really a jQuery question, but I search a table where are listed all the "language code" like those "fr_FR", "en_US",... ?
11:03  zeddej: adds styling to the buttons
11:03  unfo-: zeddej, ah kk.
11:03  zeddej: removing it didn't help
11:04  zeddej: can i just replace x= with &times= ?
11:04  markj: ?g languages codes @ jomofcw
11:04  bot-t: jomofcw, ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of ... - http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
11:04  markj: ignore that one
11:04  markj: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533052%28VS.85%29.aspx this is the kind of thing I guess?
11:05  Superman_: ..
11:06  zeddej: cmon this is messed up
11:07  jomofcw: markj thanks and hi :D. But it's doesn't seem to be that one :/
11:08  unfo-: zeddej, console.log(courseID, timeJSON) and open up dev tools in ie8 if it is messed up in only ie8
11:08  jomofcw: Perhaps that's not ISO...
11:09  zeddej: unfo-: returns: LOG: 479[object Object]
11:09  zeddej: if i output the stringified JSON it gives me: LOG: 479{"2010-12-26 10:00:00":" 11:40:00","2010-12-27 10:00:00":" 11:40:00","2010-12-28 10:00:00":" 11:40:00","2010-12-29 10:00:00":" 11:40:00","2010-12-30 10:00:00":" 11:40:00","2010-12-31 10:00:00":" 11:40:00"}
11:10  dbugger: Hey guys. Can someone please tell me why Im not getting a smooth animation here? http://iljamess.de/index_galerie.html
11:11  unfo-: zeddej, try setting: var href = 'newCourseBooking.php?course='+courseID+'&times='+stringified; and then console.log that before you set it to location href
11:11  zeddej: im a moron
11:11  zeddej: i had a typo
11:11  zeddej: sorry
11:11  zeddej: $(location).attr('href','newCourseBooking.php?&times='+stringified+'&course='+courseID);
11:11  zeddej: thats what i had

11:24  zeddej: holy shit
11:24  zeddej: how do i even start to debug that? :D
11:24  doonie: alert party!
11:25  Xtracted: zeddej: the web developer tool in IE8 is a good place to start =P
11:25  sean`: use IE9
11:25  sean`: with Ie8 mode stuff
11:26  sean`: and zeddej buy a brain
11:26  sean`: I believe amazon has some
11:26  zeddej: sean`: ?
11:26  Xtracted: zeddej: IETester is a good program as well to have
11:26  sean`: Whats up zeddej ?
11:26 * doonie eats sean` brain
11:26  sean`: What'
11:26  sean`: s not working
11:26  doonie: ?botsnack
11:26  bot-t: Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
11:26 * sean` gives doonie brain
11:26  sean`: oh, that's not as funny as it seemed
11:27  zeddej: meh, cant believe IE 8 manages to screw up a simple script that much
11:27  sean`: ?ud brain
11:27  bot-t: sean`, brain - Another word for head, or blowjob. This term is most appropriate however, because unfortuantley, most male brains reside in their penile regions
11:27  zeddej: its just mathematics
11:27  unfo-: sean`, lol @ brain
11:28  Xtracted: zeddej: Develop using IE, when you're done start up Firefox and fix so it works there, then go to Chrome.. =)
11:28  sean`: eh
11:28  sean`: i work the other way around
11:28  sean`: but it might be saver that way
11:28  JKarsrud: ew
11:28  JKarsrud: I'd hate myself if I had to work with IE all the time
11:28  JKarsrud: :P
11:29  Xtracted: sean: I do too, but my stuff usually works fine in IE... if you have problems writing code that works in IE you should develop in IE for a while to learn how it works

11:31  trollboy: Jeff_Chew, you're still asking for help
11:31  trollboy: seriously man
11:32  Xtracted: Jeff_Chew: Look into json and ajax in jquery
11:35  Xtracted: I use jQuery.ajax() to get a bunch of data from my database. How do I group the data (in this case I want all data that has the same Category ID to be grouped together)?
11:36  JKarsrud: Xtracted: Push the grouped data from the server?
11:36  Xtracted: Hmm
11:36  JKarsrud: easier and better than doing it with js
11:37  hariom: cork: I am sending parameter in .getJSON as data: {key1: 'value', key2: 'value', keyN: 'value' }
11:38  hariom: Now how to retrieve it at the other end? I only see "object" when I get the data at server side
11:39  Xtracted: JKarsrud: better to put the load on the client then the server? =)
11:39  JKarsrud: no, better to put the load on the server
11:39  Cork: hariom: json doens't use data:
11:39  Cork: hariom: getJSON('url', {});
11:39  unfo-: Xtracted, grouping them server-side is not much of a load.
11:41  hariom: Cork: this is how I am sending: $.getJSON('code/mycode', {data: {key1: 'value', key2: 'value', keyN: 'value' }}, function(res){ ... })
11:42  Cork: hariom: and you can't get it as $_POST['data']['key1'] on the other end?
11:42  Cork: opps
11:42  Cork: * $_GET['data']['key1']
11:43  hariom: Cork: When I try request.get('data') I get "object". When I try request.get('data')[0]  I get "["  and request.get('data')[1] I get 'o'
11:43  owzzz: hey guys, can anyone explain to me why Im getting a not defined js error on the variable outputstring? http://pastebin.com/3QAsdJtc
11:44  Cork: hariom: wierd...
11:44  owzzz: I have run Console logs on all the values and they are correct... Yet when it comes to inseting the outputstring into the title div using.html it comes back saying it is not defined
11:44  Cork: hariom: what does it show in the request if you inspect it in your console (firebug, or what ever you use)
11:45  owzzz: just refreshed it.. and now it just does not get inserted into the fancybox-title div
11:45  hariom: Cork: In firebug it shows data: [object Object]
11:46  hariom: Cork: In firebug it shows "data [object Object]"
11:46  owzzz: if I copy the line: $('#fancybox-title').html(outPutString); and paste that into the console it works..
11:46  owzzz: why is it not working on the click event?
11:50  Cork: hariom: are you creating { data: } as a string?
11:50  Cork: can't think of another reason it would show up like that
11:52  hariom: Cork: Nope. $.getJSON('code/mycode', {data: {key1: value1, key2: value2} }, function(res){ ...} )
11:53  Cork: hariom: wierd
11:53  Cork: not sure why it does that for you
11:55  Cork: hariom: i get /code/mycode?data%5Bkey1%5D=value1&data%5Bkey2%5D=value2 when i run $.getJSON('code/mycode', {data: {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'} });
11:56  level09: I cant use html to inject a complex string :s
11:56  level09: any alternatives to that ?
11:56  level09: $('#div').html(<?php echo $mystring; ?>);

12:02  hariom: if that is possible then I can decode them at server side.
12:02  hariom: json.load(request.get('data'))
12:02  Cork: hariom: not as parameters no
12:03  Cork: hariom: you would have to use toJSON from http://json.org
12:04  hariom: Cork: Isn't there any way to convert get parameters into json and send to the server?
12:04  hariom: ok

12:37  Aragon: revolveweb, havent tried it, the solution works
12:38  ravenzz: not sure
12:38  revolveweb: np :]
12:38  ravenzz: btw it selects
12:38  Aragon: oh i see it doesnt work :D
12:38  ravenzz: your span
12:38  Aragon: it always selects the first span
12:38  ravenzz: yeah
12:38  Aragon: :D
12:38  ravenzz: becouse i think that
12:38  Aragon: i will try revolveweb's solution ;)
12:38  ravenzz: you need to place an each somewhere
12:39  ravenzz: you have to trigger that event for each .bestellen-box-input

13:15  hariom: I have refreshed my page several times and I see in the net, its getting loaded. There is only one error and that is "toJSON is not a function"
13:18  doonie: is the page live
13:18  hariom: doonie: no, its localhost
13:18  hariom: I am using jquery 1.4.2
13:18  hariom: and other plugins
13:18  doonie: weird indeed. send some screenshots maybe on the net tab and the console of the error as we cannot test outselves
13:20  sean`: hariom, give a link to a demo

13:34  sean`: read hariom
13:34  sean`: JKarsrud, isn't it obvious? Norwegians
13:34  hariom: Read. HTML is nothing but a loading in <head> and then calling toJSON in a function.
13:35  hariom: Irrespective of that, if should work in firebug also I guess
13:35  sean`: hariom, you want help? go through the proper channels

13:39  Trisox: where would you use it for?
13:39  thyphus: i have a  list with available items and a list with selected items... and want to drag the items from one to the another
13:39  JKarsrud: thyphus: Not out of the box, no. There would have to be some trickery done. Might be easier to simulate a dropdown-list with CSS and JS
13:39  Trisox: draging i side a puldown would not work that wel i think

13:45  Patatouf: hello ! I am using jquery with Zend. When I submit a form, it executes an action and redirect either to the view page (if succeeds) either to the form (if doesnt succeed). I would like this "answer" to refresh a div when I submit the form instead of loading the whole page. How can I do that ?
13:45  JKarsrud: Trisox: Yeah, government sites have strict rules when it comes to a11y, so it's beyond me to understand why on earth the app is made in flash
13:45  thyphus: sean`: i don't know what you mean with that. a small hin?
13:45  thyphus: hint
13:46  JKarsrud: https://skjema.reiseregningen.no/
13:46  sean`: thyphus, with sortable you can drag/drop list items from one to anotehr
13:46  thyphus: sean`: that's clear. used it already
13:46  sean`: thyphus, http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
13:46  thyphus: but i want a scrollable list
13:46  sean`: So, just style them accordingly
13:46  thyphus: hm... with a div it could work
13:46  sean`: overflow: auto;
13:46  thyphus: yea :)
13:46  thyphus: thanks
13:46  JKarsrud: thyphus: overflow: scroll or auto then :)
13:46  sean`: Why?
13:46  sean`:  You have an UL
13:46  sean`: ul { height: 10px; overflow: auto; }
13:46  thyphus: ah
13:46  thyphus: ok
13:46  thyphus: thanks

13:47  Trisox: JKarsrud i hate flash
13:48  Trisox: its only good for very hard animations
13:48  JKarsrud: Patatouf: Yeah, use $.ajax, and return a partial view with the info, that you can append to a div in the success: callback :)
13:48  JKarsrud: ?ajax

13:50  Trisox: its only good for things like 3d animations..
13:51  Trisox: and stuff like that
13:51  Patatouf: thank you JKarsrud ! so i can do something like $('#button').click($('#divToRefresh').load($.ajax($('#MyForm).submit()))) ? :)

I am getting that a is not a defined variable.. how can I reach a.abc.main from inside the declaration ? Is it possible to use this ? and without having to declare the full path ?
13:52  quicksilver: JenniferB2: just declare a on the line before.
13:52  quicksilver: var a; a = { ..... }
13:53  JKarsrud: Patatouf: More like this: $('#button').click(function() { $.ajax({url: someUrl, data: $('#myForm').serialize(), dataType: html, success: function(response) { $('divToRefresh').html(response) }});
13:53  JKarsrud: or something, hard to see on one line :P

13:55  JKarsrud: I find json passing is easier if you have a model that looks the same on the server
13:55 --- sean is now known as sean`
13:55  JKarsrud: lol
13:56  felixjet: is there any way to force the src update without doing src = '', src = 'again same data' ?
13:56  JKarsrud: felixjet: It works, are you sure the two urls are identical?
13:56  felixjet: yes, identical
13:57  felixjet: its an ajax avatar uploader, when user click upload, the new src="" of an image should be updated with the new uploaded image (returned by ajax)
13:57  felixjet: it works fine if the user upload for example, a png file when the old one was a jpg
13:57  felixjet: but if the old one is png, and he upload png again, because the name of file is the same, the src attr is not updated
13:58  crab: how does one pop up a form?
13:58  felixjet: i can do something like if new src == old src { src = ''; src = 'new'; }
13:58  felixjet: but thats crap
13:59  sean`: felixjet, ternary
13:59  felixjet: ternary?

14:00  sean`: or if (src == 'a') { 'foo' } else { 'bar' }
14:00  felixjet: sean` yea, but thats a crappy way to fix it, dont you think?
14:00  crab: i suppose i'll find a site that does it and see how.
14:00  sean`: I don't know what your problem is
14:01  felixjet: the problem is that i refresh a <img src=""> dinamically
14:01  felixjet: but if the new value of src, is the same as the one that dom has load, it doesnt change
14:01  felixjet: for example, foo.png -> foo.png
14:01  felixjet: the image doesnt change, even if they are two different images
14:02  felixjet: it only works if the name or extension is different
14:02  Napsi: can someone help me with autopopulate mysql driver selection?
14:02  sean`: felixjet, that's cache
14:02  sean`: you could do foo.png?randomstring
14:03  felixjet: if ajax send a header with no-cache it will work?
14:03  sean`: -.-
14:03  sean`: It's not to do with ajax

14:27  Mimo: jepster: what doesn't work
14:27  Mimo: the event?
14:31  jepster: Mimo: the event isn't working, because there is no effect, when I click on the checkbox. the event only works in the first example, when I click on the body-container.

14:42  lephisto: so is it a problem to have controls for that in a div?
14:42  Mimo: _dave_h_d: first thing (for optimisation you need  to store all the slectors in a array
14:42  Mimo: _dave_h_d: in a array or object (geus array would do)
14:43  onre: mengu_, look at window.onbeforeunload
14:43  Mimo: each loop

14:46  unfo-: ohcibi, anchro.attr("data-eventid")

14:46  Mimo: _dave_h_d: http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/

14:50  unfo-: ohcibi, val('100') - does that work?
14:50  unfo-: sorry
14:50  unfo-: meant ocharles
14:50  ohcibi: unfo-: whoops.. still using 1.4.2 just updatet to 1.4.3... now i get undefined 8-)

14:50  jomofcw: Is there a OCRE version now of that > http://plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object (old one ^^), please ?
14:50  jomofcw: CORE
14:50  _dave_h_d: i need to loop all the checkboxes and then see if each this is checked and then do the checking or unchecking on it
14:50  quicksilver: ocharles: I think .val() doesn't work for <select> and you should instead find the <option> you want
14:50  ohcibi: unfo-: because i misstyped... so element.data("key") is working in 1.4.3 to get elements data-key attribute
14:50  quicksilver: ocharles: and do $('...selector for option').attr('selected','selected')
14:50  unfo-: ohcibi, :)
14:50  phrearch: hi
14:51  phrearch: is it possible to trigger an event for multiple custom binded functions?
14:51  phrearch: or can i use delegate for that?
14:51  ocharles: quicksilver: the docs say it works for <select>
14:51  phrearch: what i need is trigger an event, which can have several different implementations
14:52  ocharles: quicksilver: though interestingly, it appears that val() uses the name of the option, not the value of it
14:52  unfo-: ocharles, i would guess you might have a whitespace issue in the options/values... mind pasting your select + options in a pastebin?
14:52  ocharles: cause that makes sense...
14:53  ocharles: http://pastie.org/1332340 no whitespace in my values
14:53  ocharles: but if val() really does select based on the option text, not the value, then it's useless to me anyway
14:53  unfo-: really weird name/id for your select o_O
14:54  ocharles: maybe in isolation, makes sense with the rest of work. and it's perfectly valid
14:54  unfo-: yeah sure.. just noting :)
14:55  unfo-: looks like it's generated, but weird still ;)
14:55  quicksilver: ocharles: ok, so perhaps $('#id-ar.link_type_id option[value=189]').attr('selected','selected') will work out better for you :)
14:56  ocharles: yes, that's a fucking mess though
14:56  ocharles: but i'll at least try it
14:56 --- ||cw2 is now known as ||cw
14:56  quicksilver: doesn't look like a mess to me.
14:59  quicksilver: beauty in the eye of the behold etc.
14:59  nail_: #id-ar.link_type_id wont select correct, it will look for #id-ar with a link_type_id class
14:59  unfo-: i agree that select.val('value') should work
14:59  ocharles: nail_: I'm using \\.
14:59  ocharles: I already said that the selector works.
14:59  ocharles: quicksilver: that does work, it's still hardly a solution in my opinion. but well, that's the way it is
14:59  quicksilver: pretty easy to wrap it into a better function if you choose.
14:59  ocharles: oh i'll certainly be doing that :)

15:05  sac: what's the proper way to check if an element is in the DOM?
15:06  sac: i mean detached or removed
15:07  doonie: select it and check .length
15:07  erichynds: $.contains(elem, document.body)
15:07  sac: so if i have var foo = $('#anelement'); foo.detach(); alert(foo.length); it will alert 0?

15:11  crab: can i check out a copy of all the jqueri ui example/demo code from somewhere?
15:11  erichynds: crab, clone the repo on github
15:12  sac: btw is there a difference in performance between $(document.body).contains(elem) and $.contains(elem, document.body)?
15:12  sac: or any reason why i should prefer one over the other
15:12  crab: erichynds: thanks.
15:12  erichynds: sac, there isn't a $().contains()
15:12  erichynds: just $.contains
15:12  sac: oh
15:12  phrearch: hm i have a websocket open/close event that i want to broadcast in my whole application. can i use bind for that? like $(document).bind('WS_ONLINE', function(event) {})
15:12  sac: hehe, but generally :)
15:12  crab: sac: so the reason to prefer the latter is that it works ;-)
15:12  phrearch: if i use it multiple times, wont the bind event just be overwritten?
15:12  sac: let's say $.data(foo, 'bar') and $(foo).data('bar')
15:12  erichynds: no, you'll just be binding multiple handlers
15:12  erichynds: sac, the latter just calls $.data
15:12  erichynds: along with some additional processing
15:12  erichynds: but $.data is much faster
15:12  phrearch: ok thanks
15:12  erichynds: $().data() fires events, $.data doesn't iirc
15:12  sac: ok, so there are differences in those
15:12  erichynds: yeah
15:12  sac: and i'd assume the overhead is usually if you use the one where you first create the jquery object
15:12  erichynds: indeed
15:13  erichynds: the obj creation isn't necessarily the overhead though
15:13  sac: ok, thanks
15:13  sac: jquery caches it somehow?
15:13  sac: if you do it once, it'll do it faster next time?
15:13  erichynds: what?
15:14  erichynds: if you have a DOM element and don't need events to be fired - just read/set data on an element - $.data will be faster

15:55  StR: anyone using jqGrid? Do you know where to find documentation on what the server should return on add/edit/delete ?
15:55  dgx: So the problems I see is that in FF it does change the class(special > special1) but not in IEs.

15:59  Jonz: haven't seen anyone do that in js before
16:00  Jonz: dgx what error happens in IE? It doesn't really crash the browser does it?
16:00  dgx: Yea, I do. Because otherwise it hurts my eyes, helps me read better. I do the same with html/css code as well.
16:00  dgx: Jonz: No, what it does is, animate the width/height and stops there.
16:04  dgx: One line before the .attr line, there is a color change of the paragraphs, which work in ff, not in IEs.
16:04  Jonz: dgx are you using Jquery UI?
16:04  Jonz: dgx, nothing about this looks like it *shouldn't* work, but my suggestions would be to take those css property objects and just make them CSS classes in the stylesheet, then animate between them (you will need jquery UI to animate a transition between css classes, but I assume you have it because you also need it for the color change animation)
16:04  dgx: Oh and it works in Chome,Opera and Safari too.
16:04  dgx: Yea im using jquery UI 1.8.
16:06 @ajpiano: dgx: a) you should be using toggle for this, not two click events.
16:06  Jonz: $('.sPhone').click(function() { $(this).toggleClass('open', 500) }
16:06 @ajpiano: and b) you should be using classes instead of manipulating style rules
16:06  Jonz: put all the css crap in the stylesheet
16:06 @ajpiano: c) there's still visibility:hidden on the special p
16:06 @ajpiano: so why would you expect it to be visible
16:06 @ajpiano: oh, right, you changed the class
16:06 @ajpiano: but yeah
16:06 * ajpiano already regrets
16:06  Prometheus: StR: did you look at the examples?
16:07  Prometheus: I'm pretty sure the demos cover that part
16:07  dgx: ajpiano: Thanks for the advices, when I use toggleClass, would be animated the same way as animate()?
16:09  StR: Prometheus, I'm on it, but no luck for now
16:09 @ajpiano: if you use jqueryui's toggle class, yeah it should be
16:09  Prometheus: StR: did you look at the PHP examples?
16:09 @ajpiano: dgx, i was saying you should be using toggle(fn,fn) instead of two click events bound to the same element, one of which will work and one wont and will be fired on every click
16:09 @ajpiano: which is silly
16:09  Tomashe: how do i make a var global?
16:09  Prometheus: StR: but I would imagine someone has written an example of how you can do it for your preferred backend
16:09  dgx: I guess you are right. I will try to implement them, thanks for your time.
16:10  StR: Prometheus, I did not find any documentation specific for PHP. If you mean the PHP codesnips on each of the demos, then yes, I did saw that
16:11  edbaffei: hi.. why does this continue to the link -- http://dpaste.com/281136/
16:11  Prometheus: StR: you could also pull out firebug and see what kind of requests it's making
16:12 @ajpiano: edbaffei, cause you need to preventDefault, not stopPropagation
16:12  edbaffei: ajpiano.. thanks
16:12  StR: Prometheus, I could see what kind or request it's making, it won't explain what kind or response it's expecting
16:12  dgx: Oh one last thing, is there some reason I missed why it works in FF and not in IEs?
16:13  Prometheus: StR: of course it won't
16:13  Prometheus: but it's a pretty good indicator.
16:14  Over[A2xS]: hey all !
16:15  Over[A2xS]: question : how can i do something like bind() or live() to trigger an event when a val of an input textfield change ?

16:25  chrismcintosh: say i am using the jQuery ColorPicker plugin from http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ and after the initial creation i wanted to change the color of the ColorPicker?
16:29  RTPMatt_: sveajob: jQuery 1.3 and earlier used JavaScript’s eval to evaluate incoming JSON. jQuery 1.4 uses the native JSON parser if available. It also validates incoming JSON for validity, so malformed JSON (for instance {foo: "bar"}) will be rejected by jQuery in jQuery.getJSON and when specifying “json” as the dataType of an Ajax request.
16:33  sveajobb: RTPMatt, well that sounds reasonable however on some I get an error, such as on this one {'status':'normal'} and on others I don't get anything. not even an error

17:47  blackxored: jquery hoverintent plugin doesn't seem to be compatible with 1.4.4, does anybody knows if there's a version which is compatible with it, or another plugin with similar functionality you've used and liked?
17:48  bot-t: blackxored, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using doTimeout (http://bit.ly/12WSwE).

17:58  rzec: how would I go about detecting that both the left ctrl and a key are being pressed at the same time?
17:59 @ajpiano: rzec event.ctrlKey
17:59  owzzz: anyone got any experience with flowplayer and fancybox?
17:59 @ajpiano: and look up a keycode reference
17:59  aidan: How can I use draggable and create "drop targets", e.g. specific regions I can drop divs in?
18:00 @ajpiano: use droppable?
18:00  aidan: oh, didn't know about droppable :(

18:22  BenMatthew: Hey, does anyone know how to select a form label in jquery when the label is in focus?
18:22  BenMatthew: I mean when the form field is in focus* /\ /\ /\
18:23  bobo_b__: Does anybody know how to change a button's icon?
18:23  bobo_b__: (in jquery mobile)
18:23  serio: it's called css
18:24  ravenzz: BenMatthew you mean that your input box is in focus and you'd like to select his label?
18:24  BenMatthew: ravenzz: Yup, thats the one. I'd like to do that.
18:24  BillCriswell: BenMatthew: It sounds like you just want to add a class or something to a label when its input is focused?
18:25  ravenzz: if you're using the for attr
18:25  BenMatthew: BillCriswell: Yeah basically so I can change the text color
18:25  ravenzz: on label id will be
18:25  ravenzz: easy
18:25  ravenzz: basucally you have
18:26  ravenzz: <label for="someelement">MyElement</label>
18:26  ravenzz: <input id="someelement" type="text" />
18:27  BillCriswell: BenMatthew: This is how I'd do it... $(':input').focus(function(e) { $('label[for=' . $(this).attr('id') . ']').addClass('focused'); }).blur(function(e) { $('label[for=' . $(this).attr('id') . ']').removeClass('focused'); });
18:28  ravenzz: so $('#someelement').focus(function() { alert($('label[for="'+$(this).attr('id')+'"]').html()); })
18:28  ravenzz: :?
18:28  BillCriswell: Yeah use +... sorry I was just writing PHP. =(
18:28  ravenzz: :D
18:29  ravenzz: happen to me too :p
18:29  BenMatthew: BillCriswell: ravenzz: Nice thank you so much guys
18:29  BillCriswell: No problem at all!
18:30  BenMatthew: I was thinking there would have been a function to select form labels easily instead of string matching.
18:31  ravenzz: me too
18:32  ravenzz: that was the first/fast solution that i think
18:32  BillCriswell: I can't think of ay other way.. though I do feel it should be a bit easier.
18:32  bobo_b__: So i have e.g. data-icon="plus" on my button, but setting this attribute to a different value doesn't trigger a re-rendering...
18:33 @ajpiano: bobo_b__, the elements in jquery mobile are jquery ui widgets, you could try using the jquery ui option-setter syntax
18:34 @ajpiano: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#method-option
18:34  ravenzz: usually the labes appears before the element so he could select the prev label
18:35  ravenzz: for the element
18:35  BillCriswell: ravenzz: That depends way too much on the HTML though.
18:36  BillCriswell: Without seeing the HTML it can't really be suggested. =(
18:36  jqp: does templating (e.g. http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/) violate the idea of unobtrusive javascript?
18:37 @ajpiano: no
18:37 @ajpiano: templating is not for creating your content elements, by and large
18:38 @ajpiano: it is for performantly generating like-elements that need to be created on the fly
18:38 @ajpiano: comments, news that's coming in from an outside feed, etc etc
18:39  rmurphey: certainly you could use it in ways that violate the idea of unobtrusive javascript
18:40  rmurphey: and there might even be perfectly good reasons to do so
18:40  rmurphey: but it does not, inherently, violate the idea
18:41  jqp: and would it violate the idea of keeping structure/content and behavior separate, e.g. by mixing html into javascript?
18:42 @ajpiano: jqp: have you or have you not created an element in javascript before
18:42 @ajpiano: it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do with a milllion bajillion use-cases
18:42  diggaNY: hey, Im tryin to use jquery tools / overlay , and trying to get it to Validate, by surrounding the img with an A tag, but the overlay isnt workin =/ any ideas why ?
18:42  diggaNY: Im trying to initiate it like this...
18:42  diggaNY: $(document).ready(function() {
18:42  diggaNY: $("a[rel]").overlay();
18:42  diggaNY: });
18:42  b1lly: when jquery says: dependencies: UI Core
18:43  b1lly: is that a seperate file from the jquery.js
18:43  b1lly: found it nm
18:43 @ajpiano: b1lly: it's jquery UI...
18:43 @ajpiano: b1lly: that's the second time in like 2 days you've asked a question you were in the middle of researching and then found the answer less than 20 seconds later
18:43 @ajpiano: you can feel free to not bother asking in those situations :)
18:43  b1lly: lol
18:43  b1lly: ;o
18:44  b1lly: sry
18:44  jqp: ajpiano: agreed, and i've created elements in jquery, but i occasionally get the feeling that i'm violating best practices
18:44  peekaboo: ajpiano: Teach him the power of fortune telling ! :o
18:44 @ajpiano: jqp: are you sure you don't mean "voodoo superstitions" instead of "best practises" there
18:44 @ajpiano: :p
18:44  rmurphey: jqp: say that you fetch some json data from your server, it contains an array of people objets
18:44  rmurphey: objects
18:44  rmurphey: and now you need to show a list of people on your page, using that array
18:45  rmurphey: how would you do it?
18:45  diggaNY: any ideas?
18:45  diggaNY: :
18:45  diggaNY: :|
18:45  bobo_b__: ajpiano: thanks, that's what i thought, but this doesn't work:
18:45  bobo_b__: $( "#mybutton" ).button( "option", "icons", {primary:'ui-icon-gear',secondary:'ui-icon-triangle-1-s'} );
18:45 @ajpiano: hmm, i bunno
18:46  RTPMatt_: What is create a bunch of messy javascript with string concats?
18:46  jqp: rmurphey: by mixing html into javascript, e.g. by iterating through the array of objects and populating html elements with each object's properties
18:46  rmurphey: jqp: this is what templates are for :)
18:46 --- mfer is now known as mfer-lunch
18:46 @ajpiano: jqp: that's exactly what templates do, only, in the most performant way possible and eliminating much of the bitchwork
18:47  rmurphey: jqp: you'd provide that array to a template
18:47  rmurphey: and it would generate the markup for you
18:47  rmurphey: ready to be added to your page

18:57  diggaNY: omg wtf! i cant get anything but rel= to work on this overlay any ideas?
18:57  peekaboo: diggaNY: Did you really have to bring our Lord into this?
18:57  dilvie: jqp: Generally speaking, if you're creating elements, or messing with colors or page layout in JavaScript, you're doing it wrong -- but there are a ton of use-cases where that's exactly what you need to do. In other words, you should think twice. If what you're doing absolutely has to be dynamically generated, and can't be handled in the HTML, or in the CSS, you're probably OK.
18:58  aidan: rmurphey: tell me more, I didn't know there was javascript templates
18:58  rmurphey: ?g jquery templates
18:58  bot-t: rmurphey, Templates – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
18:58  aidan: cool
18:58  diggaNY: lol
18:58  diggaNY: http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/40/36626
18:59  diggaNY: tryin to do this not workin =/
19:00  jqp: dilvie: i guess my confusion is in where those use cases are appropriate, and when using javascript to adjust content and presentation is obtrusive
19:00 @ajpiano: ?templating @ aidan
19:00  bot-t: aidan, jQuery's official templating solution - http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl | underscore.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ | mustache.js - http://mustache.github.com/
19:00  aidan: $(this).prepend(ui.draggable); .. how do I make this copy ui.draggable instead of removing it
19:00 @ajpiano: aidan try .clone()
19:00 @ajpiano: ui.draggable.clone()
19:01  aidan: neat
19:01  dilvie: jqp: That really depends on the type of application you're creating. If you can create the elements on the server side, do it on the server side. Read up on progressive enhancement.
19:03  dilvie: jqp: It would be much easier to answer a few case questions. Give us an example and ask a direct question (e.g. is this javascript too obtrusive? Is there a better way to do this?)
19:03  tristan_: does jquery have any methods for dealing with rotational animation?
19:05  dilvie: jqp: The best question to ask yourself is, "how would I do this without javascript?" -- then do it that way. Then ask yourself, "How can I improve this experience with JavaScript without breaking the functionality that's already there?" -- then do it.
19:05  JuJuBee: Any suggestions on plugin to make sure users dont navigate away from page before submitting changes?
