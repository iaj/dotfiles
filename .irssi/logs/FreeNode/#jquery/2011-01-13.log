00:00  blindMoe: hrmm it is working on jsfiddle.net so I guess there is some other container that is constraining it
00:00  amh345: z-index:9999; should make my animated div display ontop of divs it overlaps on, no?  the animated div is expanding underneath images.
00:01  `teh1: amh345:  is it position:relative;
00:01  `teh1: or absolute, or fixed
00:01  apollo9: amh345: also, it can depend on any containing element's z-index as well.
00:02  amh345: it's got no position at all!!   let me try that.
00:02  `teh1: lol
00:02  apollo9: position is required for sure.
00:02  amh345: that did it!
00:02  amh345: awesomeness. thanks guys.
00:02  istvan: hey, i'm working with datepicker and having an issue - my code is: $("#datepicker").datepicker({ altFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' }); -- the datepicker comes up, but he date returned is: 01/24/2011
00:02  `teh1: http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pos_z-index.asp
00:02  `teh1: amh345:
00:02  `teh1: Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).
00:03  `teh1: anyone used jscrollpane before?
00:03  blindMoe: `teh1: would height: auto; work with a <ul> when switching between <li> elements inside?  ( like a fade in/out effect )
00:03  `teh1: height should be auto by default
00:04  `teh1: there is also a javascript/jquery was of getting the content height i believe
00:04  `teh1: but you minus well just leave height to auto and let the browser's html rendering handle it
00:04  blindMoe: I am sure I could do something like $('#idOfUrl').css('height', $(this).css('height')); but I would rather do it via css
00:05  recurs|ve: anyone know of a walkthrough for extending jQuery and using jasmine to test? -- something is not working in my app that used to
00:05  blindMoe: I actually don't need to use a ul or li's.. will switch it to something else and see if that fixes it
00:05  `teh1: okey
00:06  dts: I'm having trouble with jQuery's startup sequence, it is doing some bizarre things when I load it into a "XUL" (firefox extension environment) DOM.  Reading the code, I'm confused by some of the JS.
00:07  blindMoe: `teh1: switching it to <span>'s instead of <li>'s works fine now
00:07  mtnmandan: Specifically, in teh beginning there's a structure: var jQuery = function(bla) { bla },_jQuery
00:07  dts: does this make just make multiple variables?
00:08  `teh1: blindMoe:  ok cool
00:08  `teh1: alas i have found the answer to my really-weird-fucking-behavior problem in jscrollpane
00:08  `teh1: so peace out
00:08  `teh1: :)
00:09  delinquentme: hey all .. ive got this magical JS query  ... im trying to figure out if the ['BusyImage'] is a call to an ID      ...  http://pastie.org/1454445
00:10  mtnmandan: sorry - had to chagen usernames from "dts" to "mtnmandan"
00:11  aquagrunty: javascript framework comparison request
00:12  aquagrunty: looking at using just jquery/ui/tools to make a corporate frontend
00:13  aquagrunty: but uki, mochaui, and alloy ui are competing
00:13  aquagrunty: tried to go on wikipedia for comparison, but their table is backwards
00:13  aquagrunty: i posted a transposed table in hopes that someone out there will remedy it

00:17  backinnam: I am trying to .show() an <a> element but with display: block;
00:17  backinnam: it is coming in by default as inline
00:18  backinnam: is there a way to override the display value that .show() applies?
00:18  apollo9: You can add a class to that link.
00:18  apollo9: then display: block or w/e
00:19  backinnam: the problem is that I want to use one of the UI animations on show()
00:19  backinnam: otherwise I could just toggle classes
00:20  apollo9: Then if you can use the .css file, can you just do something like .show().css('display', 'block')  ?
00:20  apollo9: Or am I still missing the point there?
00:20  erichynds: backinnam, does the element start off as a block element?
00:20  aquagrunty: ^
00:21  aquagrunty: <a> is by default an inline element

00:22 --- danheberden is now known as danheberden|away
00:22  Trisox: nn
00:26  backinnam: erichynds: it starts as display: none;  so I assume jQuery just assigns it to the elements default
00:26  erichynds: jquery restores the starting value
00:26  erichynds: so
00:26  erichynds: it won't be set to block unless it started out that way
00:26  Soopaman: does anyone know of any plugins or tutorials for scaling font sizes and element dimensions?
00:26  Ely2: Hi, I have the following code that only show numbers in a text
00:26  apollo9: So, can you set it after you show it?
00:27  elryry: hey guys can someone tell me why lightbox isn't working here: http://layout.shirtsby.me/design.html
00:27  erichynds: apollo9, yep
00:27  Ely2: is it possible to only show the numbers after te 2nd / ?
00:27  erichynds: apollo9 or set it to block to begin with in your css
00:27  erichynds: if that's the desired styling
00:27  Ely2: actuall between the first / and the first " that is found?
00:27  apollo9: Right, that's what I suggested earlier, but I guess the guy didn't want to go with that option.

00:27  TeddyMurray: hi, i have a plugin that's supposed to be creating a menu when the mouse is right clicked on an image -- how do i position this menu element? ive tried using the e.pageX and e.pageY
00:28  elryry: a.lightbox is on line 82 and the jquery $("a.lightbox").lightbox() is at the bottom of main.js
00:28  erichynds: TeddyMurray, look @ position() and offset()
00:28  Ely2: more clear: http://jsfiddle.net/GYPqX/2/  .. show the number bewteen the first / en "
00:29  TeddyMurray: ok ty erichynds
00:30  TeddyMurray: erichynds, what if the clicked elements are within a div?
00:30  TeddyMurray: how could i get the relative position? starting within that div

00:43  falcom: ouch
00:44  Ely2: mmz true
00:44  Ely2: couldn't find it :o
00:45  falcom: in javascript you can use string method "match"
00:45  falcom: var string = "dkfalk/2234/d" ; string.match(/\/\dD+/\/);
00:47  falcom: correction --->     /\/\D+/\/
00:47  Ely2: ok .. I see
00:47  Ely2: but where do I need to use it inside he code?
00:48  falcom: what do you want to do?
00:48  Ely2: just copie pasted your code
00:48  Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/GYPqX/3/
00:48  Ely2: well there is that number 1
00:48  Ely2: ./1"
00:49  Ely2: I only need that number
00:49  Ely2: is always a different number
00:50  falcom: okok
00:50  falcom: before Donerdag?
00:51  Ely2: yes
00:51  Ely2: but everything can chagnge
00:51  Ely2: it's  users input
00:52  Ely2: but the / " is always there

00:57  falcom: Ely2: ^
00:57  ngharo: if you just need the first digit after /
00:58  ngharo: use /\/(\d)/
00:58  falcom: oh you can use () on javascript regex? cool
00:58  ngharo: then "asdf/234sdfa/".match(/\/(\d)/)[1] -> 2
00:59  falcom: yep

01:00  Ely2: does not seem to do  thing? http://jsfiddle.net/GYPqX/4/
01:01  falcom: Ely2: well the number is there, but you gotta do something with it
01:01  falcom: you can alert the number or print it on the page
01:01  Ely2: cant I do replace ?
01:02  falcom: hmm
01:02  delinquentme: Ely2, thanks for the thread
01:03  falcom: Ely2: sure you can, but in the most elegant way might need some thinking
01:03  jedinix: is $('div.optionalClass1, div.optionalClass2') valid?
01:03  Ely2: well, at first I do this: http://jsfiddle.net/GYPqX/6/
01:04  jedinix: Because it doesn't seem to work..
01:04  Ely2: keep all the number
01:04  Ely2: can't I only keep the one after the /
01:04  falcom: because the replace line does is replace all non numbers with ''
01:05  Ely2: true
01:05  ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/GYPqX/7/ ...
01:06  falcom: Ely2: $('.modelinfo3').html($('.modelinfo3').html().match(/\/(\d+)"/)[1]);

01:42  khurram: i have jquery form plugin and i want to submit the form using checkbox click  my form does not contain a submit button is it possible please hlep ?
01:45  rramsden: I have a nested function in javascript, when i try calling `arguments` inside the inner function it returns the outer functions arguments --> https://gist.github.com/777176 .. not really jQuery specific but its for a jQuery project :'D
01:45  sdwrage: Hey all. I am using html5uploader and it has an event (drop) that runs after you drop a file from your pc onto an element deemed the drop. This then launches an xhr request and uploads the file. I need to run a seperate xhr request $.ajax to return html to show a list of images. The only issue is... the image fetching is happening before the upload is done. How would i get around this?
01:51  sdwrage: anyone?
01:52  khmer: i need to queue effects on different elements
01:55  khmer: if $('#slide1'), $('#slide2'), and $('#slide3') are all clicked in extremely short (>100ms) succession, they should each animate for duration 1400
01:55  khmer: but they should do so in order, not concurrently
01:56  khmer: .queue is attached to a particular DOM element, so i do not know what to do!

02:26  coldhead: hi khurram
02:26  khurram: i am having a problem in passing the data:  using $.ajax  when i do print_r($_POST); i get undefined
02:26  khurram: hey coldhead :) how ya goin mate
02:27  khurram: always get happy to c u around
02:27  coldhead: $_POST should never be undefined in PHP
02:27  coldhead: it might be empty but it should still be defined
02:27  khurram: yes u r right it shows empty
02:28  ngharo: khurram: $.ajax() defaults to GET
02:28  ngharo: are you specifying post
02:29  eagles: does anyone know why passing a parameterless callback function to autocomplete as a source does not work in jquery UI 1.8.7?
02:29  khurram: i have put type: 'post'
02:30  ngharo: and you're passing some data right?
02:30  khurram: have a look here http://pastebin.com/Z5yMvReu
02:30  khurram: i get the array of data when i do alert the data looks fine the way i want
02:31  khurram: but on the server side the post doesn't get any thing
02:31  ngharo: is 'ids' just a string?
02:31  ngharo: if so do something like
02:32  ngharo: data: {key: ids},
02:32  khurram: i think it will be a string cuz it prints out '12','34',... or an array
02:32  coldhead: khurram: check with firebug in the Net tab or Console to see exactly what is being sent to the server
02:33  ngharo: The data option can contain either a query string of the form key1=value1&key2=value2, or a map of the form {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}
02:35 --- fitzgen is now known as fitzgen|away
02:35  khurram: is there any function i can transform the ids into the map
02:35  khurram: or i have to manually do it

02:37  khurram: coldhead: it it saying postparamenters undefined ?
02:38  joelklabo: I am getting some json back from my server: {"date": "2011-01-12T17:37:12.973111", "text": "1", "name": "1"}, i can access name and text easily, but date is always undefined. any idea why?
02:38  ngharo: because you're not specifying the data option correctly
02:38  joelklabo: hmmm
02:39  ngharo: joelklabo: that wasnt to you, sorry
02:39  ngharo: that's odd.  Is date a reserved keyword
02:39  ngharo: maybe try changing the name to something else
02:40  joelklabo: i don't think so but ill try that. it's coming from django
02:41  coldhead: ?eval var date = 'foo'; date
02:41  bot-t: coldhead: "foo"
02:41  coldhead: date is no problemo

02:42  coldhead: i've never seen that

02:43  khurram: yes
02:43  rramsden: two*
02:44  khurram: coldhead: i have list of post messages undefined
02:44  eagles: in short, autocomplete source does not interpret a parameterless function
02:44  joelklabo: I mean I get this: {"text": "ddd", "now": "2011-01-12T17:43:43.620968", "name": "d"}
02:45  ngharo: khurram: have you tried my suggestion, or rather followed what the docs say?
02:45  sneakyness: Hello goons, long time no see
02:45  eagles: but the autocomplete doc says that a callback is accepted
02:45  sneakyness: I'm updating some building blocks I made for frontend development
02:46  coldhead: khurram: paste the code that is doing the ajax call?
02:46  sneakyness: They used 1.3.2, jquery.color, and jquery.jqtransform, have either of those been rolled into the new versions?
02:46  sneakyness: You guys move quick, not that I'm complaining :)
02:47  sneakyness: hello coldhead I've missed you dearly
02:48  ngharo: joelklabo: you'll want to get access your json result like: post.text, post.now, post.name
02:48  ngharo: etc
02:48  ngharo: may also want to specify datatype: 'json' inside your ajax call if you know you're expecting json back
02:48  khurram: coldhead: http://pastebin.com/wuhkgvfp
02:49  ngharo: khurram: for the 3rd time, you're not using data param correctly
02:49  ngharo: you cant pass it just pass abitrary strings
02:49  khurram: i am about to write a loop to convert that data into the query string format which data: $.ajax requires
02:49  coldhead: thanks ngharo
02:50  khurram: but that is quite time consumeing
02:50  ngharo: khurram: do
02:50  ngharo: data: {map: ids}
02:50  khurram: sure :)
02:50  ngharo: then $_POST['map']

02:50  eagles: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6849
02:52  panfist: i have copied a node of my document and i was wondering if there was a syntax that would let me use jquery to on that node... http://dpaste.com/311521/
02:52  panfist: i mean, use jquery to select elements of the node
02:52  khurram: huh it was piece of CAKE...:)   thankx a lot ngharo and coldhead
02:53  panfist: i would like to change a part of the node that i have imported before i append it somewhere else
02:54  ngharo: where does the node originate from?
02:54  ngharo: and by node do you mean just like random html
02:56  panfist: yes it's a div with a bunch of random html
02:57  panfist: in general i'm trying to have a link that munges some of the content the user has put into my page, and popup a window with a printable view of it
02:57  stewart_: someone tell me why I am wrong in expecting to be able to bind events to objects that have not yet been inserted in to the DOM
02:57  panfist: so i'm copying a bunch of stuff, then i just need to add a class to one element before i append the node to the popup window
02:58  panfist: technically i'm selecting a div by id
02:58  ngharo: if its not in the DOM the browser doesn't know about it is my understanding
02:59  ngharo: panfist: hmm, i'm not sure :/
02:59  panfist: i'm not sure what you mean by that...i'm copying a branch of the dom and appending it to a new dom, to which i have a reference
02:59  ngharo: the use of a new window really botches up my thoughts
02:59  coldhead: ?serialize @ khurram
02:59  bot-t: khurram, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
03:00  coldhead: that's usually better than .map() when you can use it
03:00  panfist: i popup a new window like: var newwindow = window.open('base.html');
03:00  panfist: then i add to it with the node from the code i pasted,
03:00  panfist: var newnode = newwindow.document.importNode(oldnode,true);
03:00  panfist: newwindow.document.body.appendChild(newnode);
03:01  panfist: that adds the stuff to the new window without changing anything
03:01  panfist: i need to change newnode before i appendChild it to newwindow.document.body
03:02  ngharo: i wonder if you can $(newwindow.document).ready(function() { // append node, select it, transform it })
03:02  frewsxcv: what's faster, getelmentbyid or $('#id')
03:03  panfist: huh that's an interesting idea...thanks let me try
03:03  ngharo: panfist: or another thought is to copy your node to a hidden element inside the current dom, transform it, then append to newwwindow
03:04  panfist: that's another idea that sounds like it would definitely wokr
03:04  panfist: work
03:04  panfist: it's probably also less 'clever' than putting a $(newwindow.document).ready in another function
03:04  frewsxcv: do jquery selectors $("") return a jquery object?
03:05  ngharo: frewsxcv: you betcha
03:05  panfist: the only thing i wonder is, what if you already clicked this link and appended a hidden element already...
03:05  frewsxcv: ngharo: so i can't do $("input").value correct?
03:05  panfist: when you clicked the link, should it check for presence of an existing hidden div (by id?), and remove it, then proceed...
03:06  ngharo: frewsxcv: correct, you'd want to use jquery's .val() instead
03:06  frewsxcv: ngharo: if i did getElementByID(), could i turn the result into a jquery object?
03:06  ngharo: yes by wrapping the returned value inside $()
03:07  ngharo: you can also get to the ummm normal JS object inside the jquery object
03:07  ngharo: if you inspect the jquery object you'll see what i mean
03:07  frewsxcv: ngharo: is getElementByID() faster than using jquery selectors in the first place?
03:07  ngharo: i believe so
03:08  ngharo: but if you need the jquery object, then no
03:08  ngharo: panfist: sure? lol
03:09  panfist: sorry i'm very new to front end programming so i don't know all the best ways to do stuff that should be pretty basic i think
03:10  ngharo: sounds like you're on the right track
03:10  panfist: i'm new to javascript and the dom, and i'm also just learning how to properly test and debug this stuff
03:11  panfist: there must be a better way, though, because i was doing some pretty ugly twisty stuff to debug an ajax get request and callback
03:13  ngharo: post some code :)
03:13  ngharo: i'll be back in 20

03:41 * coldhead np: june of 44 - sharks and sailors
03:42  timmywil: m0: $(elements).each(function (i, element) { $(this) === $(element); });  you'll have to wrap this in jQuery again if you want a jQuery object, but the this keyword (and element) is only in the each function scope.  does that answer your question or did i misunderstand?
03:43  Sublinux: Hello all, I am looking to hire a fulltime JQuery programmer. Is anyone here interested?
03:44  m0: timmywil: perhaps, Foo.prototype.bar = function() { $(this).each(function (i, element) { $(this).foo( do something )} }
03:45  coldhead: could you maybe link to more details Sublinux? because the answer to your question for most people is going to be "it depends"
03:45  timmywil: that'll work, if the scope of bar is something you can select with jQuery

04:06  kenno_: http://www.jsfiddle.net/FdX6g/1/
04:07  coldhead: kenno_: submitEntry() is probably not visible outside of your document ready function
04:07  coldhead: the quick fix would be to remove the document ready function
04:08  coldhead: the better fix would be to not use onsubmit=""
04:10  panfist: http://dpaste.com/311693/
04:11  panfist: when i use that function, i can see the child node appended to the new window, but then it finishes loading and seems to overwrite what i have appended
04:11  panfist: if i just type those commands into a console, instead of clicking a link that executes that function,
04:11  panfist: it works like i would expect...a new window is created, it loads, then i append a div to it and it appears with the proper styles
04:12  panfist: but if i use that function, i initially see the popup window, then immediately after the appendChild stuff appears in the window unstyled, then a short while later it's replaced by foo.html

04:22  coldhead: conside the changes i made carefully
04:22  coldhead: if you want to use " inside a string you need to escape them
04:22  coldhead: or use another kind of quote
04:22  coldhead: please see also how it no longer uses onsubmit
04:23  kenno_: thank you, you mean onsubmit="" is a bad idea?
04:24  coldhead: jQuery avoids it
04:24  coldhead: your code works better without it
04:24  coldhead: and it encourages separation of html and JS
04:24  coldhead: which is a Good THing
04:24  kenno_: thank you, I understand now :)
04:25  coldhead: good luck!
04:35  kenno_: coldhead, in jsfiddle it works, but in my page it doesn't. those inputs named SlectedCatsID are everywhere in the template and if i check one checkbox, then it still gives me alert to check at least one :(
04:36  coldhead: kenno_: you'll have to try experimenting at the firebug console
04:36  coldhead: try running this directly there

04:49  m0: So when I have the array, I can use its index to figure out the next item.

06:25  coldhead: and we're going to use project numbers for each problem
06:25  coldhead: so i'll need you to quote both in anything you write

06:38  clu3: wookiehangover, did you mean "namespace your events" somethinng like "foo.myEvent" to be the event name?
06:38  wookiehangover: indeed I did
06:39  wookiehangover: If the eventType string contains a period (.) character, then the event is namespaced. The period character separates the event from its namespace. For example, in the call .bind('click.name', handler), the string click is the event type, and the string name is the namespace. Namespacing allows us to unbind or trigger some events of a type without affecting others. See the discussion of .unbind() for more information.

06:59  iszak: paul_irish, no
07:00  paul_irish: looks like a tough call
07:00  octatone: from that example you will see that </param> and </embed> is getting removed
07:01  paul_irish: octatone: thats because they can be removed.
07:01  octatone: but it's breaking strict encoding
07:01  paul_irish: its an HTML serialization of elements. it doesnt need the closing tags.
07:01  paul_irish: no it isnt
07:02  paul_irish: unless you're saying this is actually causing you problems....
07:02  paul_irish: thats like saying $('html').addClass('omg') is breaking xhtml spec so it shouldnt work.
07:03  iszak: paul_irish, so what's the verdict?
07:03  paul_irish: iszak: the verdict is pornel's improved pngquant, imho
07:03  paul_irish: http://pornel.net/pngquant
07:04  paul_irish: fucking guy is smart as shit.
07:04  octatone: but why is it stripping the tags at all? it should insert the content as supplied, shy is it messing with the structure?
07:04  iszak: paul_irish, smart guy can't link.
07:05  paul_irish: o?
07:05  iszak: the link to source code says http://github.com/kornel/improved-pngquant instead of http://github.com/pornel/improved-pngquant
07:05  wookiehangover: what a faux pas
07:05  paul_irish: octatone: .. a good way to look at it is.. the markup that you give the browser is a HINT on how to construct a dom.. when you then ask for .innerHTML of the dom.. it serializes those elements into a string of markup .... that markup is LEGIT and works.. but might not match what you originally inputted.
07:06  paul_irish: iszak: ah. thx. i'll tell him to fix
07:06  iszak: paul_irish, good good.
07:07  octatone: hrm, so it's not jquery that's doing it it's innerHTML
07:07  paul_irish: basically.
07:07  octatone: got it
07:07  octatone: that makes sense
07:08  iszak: paul_irish, doesn't look like i'll be using it, compiling is too much effort.

07:30  binaryfus10nz: http://ogstudios.com/ if you mouse from top to bottom on links on the left
07:30  binaryfus10nz: they animate fade in /out... I want to create a loop that animates the links like I had mouse'd down through them... if that makes sense
07:31  iszak: no seriously, can someone improve that for me.
07:32  Telegraphs: is there anything in jquery to give me a shortcut to array keys/values (yes, I know that's not javascript terminology)
07:34  coldhead: to access or declare, Telegraphs ?
07:34  iszak: pngcrush is uselesss
07:35  binaryfus10nz: iszak, what does it do
07:35  iszak: that one up there is b0rked
07:35  iszak: i need to fix

07:36  Telegraphs: eh, each isn't exactly what I need
07:36  Telegraphs: having to create a function just to iterate when I can use for (blah in foo)
07:36  binaryfus10nz: also means they should all animate same time with little delay inbetween but next should start before previous finishes
07:36  Telegraphs: I guess there isn't anything
07:36  Telegraphs: I am totally going to fork jquery and start sticking my own junk in it
07:37  ngharo: Telegraphs: you're going to have to loop no matter what
07:37  Telegraphs: ngharo: no kidding, but I don't need to create an anonymous function for no reason, and each requires me to do that
07:38  iszak: yeah pngcrush doesn't doo much
07:38  coldhead: Telegraphs: http://jsfiddle.net/FG8jN/
07:38  coldhead: i can't think of a simpler way
07:39  coldhead: _.flatten() maybe
07:39  coldhead: but not even then really
07:39  coldhead: nlogax would know
07:40  ngharo: binaryfus10nz: you can achieve that.  All the code to do is on that site already
07:40  Telegraphs: coldhead: thanks, you just saved me a headache by showing me 'push()'
07:41  Telegraphs: just tried it with += in the console, found it appends to the last element

07:42  Telegraphs: i tried to learn flash once and got pissed off because it required so much arbitrary pointing and clicking.
07:42  Telegraphs: typing pisses me off less
07:42  mdel: anyone know of a clever way to use .hover and detect over/out even if another element covers the one with the event attached?
07:42  coldhead: flash is dyin
07:42  binaryfus10nz: is it really though?
07:43  Telegraphs: well, with google dropping h264 support in chrome they just extended its lifespan.
07:43  binaryfus10nz: I feel like more than half the baller agencies use full flash

07:43  coldhead: yes it is
07:43  coldhead: ^^
07:43  mdel: the only think im thinking is to get the global offset of the original element, and then call a function on every mouse more tracking if the coords are within the original element
07:43  coldhead: mdel: i doubt there's another way
07:43  coldhead: that's not too terrible
07:43  mdel: that is not what I wanted to hear from you coldhead :(
07:44  binaryfus10nz: coldhead, the problem is I dont think you can reproduce everything... example... hit men then view intro...
07:44  binaryfus10nz:   $.backstretch("img/splash.jpg");
07:44  mdel: yeah its not, but the whole thing Im building is already kludged up
07:44  binaryfus10nz: errr >> http://www.plotnetworks.com/~seanjohnsite/sj7/
07:44  binaryfus10nz: is that possible in html5?
07:44  coldhead: mdel: last time someone asked about that paul_irish and some other nerds tried and tried and tried for hours and i don't think they got anywhere
07:44  coldhead: it was depressing
07:44  Fenda: how could I delete all h1 elements that don't have class .id-*, with * being any value from within array foo?
07:44  mdel: yeah it sounds depressing
07:45  coldhead: in fact when it was done it was a lot like this picture http://dontclickthis.whatingods.name/pooped-out.jpg
07:45  mdel: wow. thats not the best pic of Paul
07:48  coldhead: yo ChanServ can i get ops? i need to change the topic
07:48  mdel: coldhead: I bet it could be done with synthetic events... mouseover on bottom element = show the top element, mouseout top element = hide
07:48  mdel: probably wouldn't need any event other than those, so no synthetic events but that seems reasonable
07:49  coldhead: i like your other way better
07:50  coldhead: but my opinion doesn't count for much
07:50  mdel: i dunno, seems like a lot of coordinate tracking
07:50  mdel: probably hard on the browser with as many "hotspots" i have
07:51  clu3: guys, how can i disable clicking on an anchor, yet still preserving its click callbacks, in order to enable it later?
07:51  ngharo: binaryfus10nz: troll harder
07:51  coldhead: put a transparent div over the top?

09:34  steffen: mekwall: Haha maybe
09:34  keith27: we could script and force them not to leave the site ever but thats not gonna bring in real customers

Then when new widget gets initialized I clone the skeleton, modify it with supplied widget options and then show it. Is there any drawbacks in this approach?

10:38  bot-t: paul_irish, caret | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/caret
10:38  ss23: HektoR: It was answered by paul_irish - 20:37:14 <@paul_irish> .attr('id').split('form')[1]
10:38 @SlexAxton: paul_irish: how'd you figure out those keywords?
10:38  ss23: uh
10:39 @paul_irish: wat keywards
10:39  ss23: HektoR: 20:36:52 <@paul_irish> .attr('id').split('_')[1]
10:39 @SlexAxton: jquery
10:39 @SlexAxton: and caret
10:39 @paul_irish: i looked it up on w3schools
10:39  SugaSlide: i also want to know :/
10:39 @SlexAxton: ahh
10:39  SugaSlide: lol why dont you guys just make a w3schools replacement?
10:39  ss23: I heard those guys are supported by w3, pretty sweet that w3 gives us a place to learn reliable stuff :D
10:39  soee: paul_irish: and how in $(div).text( new Date().toString() ) can i set to show date in this format: 11.01.11 ?
10:39 @paul_irish: SugaSlide: IN FACT we have answered that question on the site
10:39 @paul_irish: SugaSlide: can you help soee
10:40  SugaSlide: bah
10:40 @paul_irish: some getDay() getMonth()+1 getYear() type shit
10:40  jedinix: ugh
10:40  mekwall: paul_irish: what are they going to do to make sure that we can trust them in the future?

10:40  jedinix: why can't jquery make a php-like function?
10:41  jedinix: date('m:d:Y')
10:41  jedinix: date('Y-m-d')
10:41  jedinix: sooooo easy
10:41  SugaSlide: hmm i i want to see how badly IE sucks... at rendering jQote templates.. vs chrome etc... how would i set up jsperf?
10:41  SugaSlide: it has test 1 / test 2
10:41  SugaSlide: all i wanna do is compare browsers not code samples
10:42  mekwall: jedinix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/global_objects/date
10:42  mekwall: it's easy
10:42  JKarsrud: SugaSlide: Run the samples in the different browsers, and it will show up in the browser scope at the bottom
10:42  jedinix: k
10:42  jedinix: not as good as php still
10:42  jedinix: :)
10:42  SugaSlide: yeah but its not optional you HAVE to run 2 tests
10:43  jedinix: http://php.net/date
10:43  mekwall: jedinix: well, can you run php on the client?
10:43  sean`: jedinix, there is Datejs
10:43  jedinix: eat it
10:43  mekwall: jedinix: WHAT SUX NOW?!
10:43  mytoz: datejs "sucks"
10:43  jedinix: yes, you can run it
10:43  mytoz: polluting date's prototype
10:43  jedinix: what if i want a script that can calculate a date and format it nicely like php
10:44  mekwall: jedinix: http://phpjs.org/functions/date:380
10:45  jedinix: php i can tell you pretty formated date e.g. date('r','+36 months');
10:45  jedinix: js cannot compete with that :-P
10:46  ss23: jedinix: ... that's not a valid date() call in PHP
10:47  sean`: jedinix, nothing can compare to your imagination

11:00  FinalAngel: is there a way to remap the this keyword from within a class (if using each or bind) to the class itself rather than the jquery object WITHOUT $.proxy?
11:01  jds: Heya
11:02  Aamir: FinalAngel:  var that=$(this)
11:02  FinalAngel: yeah okay without remapping it to another var
11:02  FinalAngel: i wanna keep "this" to the class where it belongs
11:03  sean`: mekwall, === not ==
11:03  Aamir: not sure if u can do this without $.proxy
11:03  mekwall: sean`: true

11:04  Aamir: jds: yes it will be loaded for sure
11:05  Andy[1]: is it possible to remove items from the "delay" queue?
11:05  jds: Aamir: Funny.  Wonder wtf is going on then
11:05  rhandom_2: At http://jsfiddle.net/rhand/ySPDb/ I have added code from Sutherlands jQuery Zoomable Maps. On line 129 there is code to append click() to region. After clicking tru maps for a while with this code I do get the alert the click option is there, but then fadeout() no longer takes place
11:05  Aamir: jds:  not sure until you tell us :)
11:05  Andy[1]: I'm running it on .scroll, but I want it to use the latest one
11:05  rhandom_2: that happens in IE only
11:05  deebo: anyone know of a plugin similiar to autocomplete, that would allow me to make json queries, and get the results in a table
11:05  deebo: kind of like a live search filter
11:05  rhandom_2: Is is a loss of scope issue? I am a JS newbie and hove no idea why this is happening
11:06  Aamir: rhandom_2:  no body will go through all your code :|
11:07  Aamir: deebo:  make json queries and get results in a table??
11:07  FinalAngel: I would LOVE to use bind, but sadly jquery has no proper crossbrowser .bind implementation even tough $.proxy is a step to the right way, will try to experiment with .call, thanks
11:07  rhandom_2: :Aamir line 128 - 140 is where the issue should be
11:08  Aamir: rhandom_2:  no line numbers in jsfiddle :(
11:08  deebo: Aamir: into a html table
11:09  Aamir: deebo:  and what do you mean by json quries ?
11:09  Aamir: queries*
11:09  deebo: not important, important is that i have x input fields, typing into one refines the search, which gets posted to the server, which returns json
11:09  Andy[1]: FinalAngel, not even .live works?

11:10  sean`: FinalAngel, DUDE READ
11:10  jds: Aamir:  I'm starting to think it's a bug in the developer version of Chrome.  Can't seem to reproduce it anywhere else
11:10  sean`: FinalAngel, bind is not jquery's bind, it's javascritp's bind
11:10  FinalAngel: I know but it doesnt work in all browsers
11:10  sean`: Yup
11:10  Aamir: jds: report to temp01
11:10  sean`: then use .call
11:10  sean`: and apply
11:10  FinalAngel: exactly, thats what I wrote :p
11:10  sean`: :)
11:12  Aamir: rhandom_2:  i suggest use .click first and do .appendTo after
11:13  FinalAngel: .call works perfect!
11:20  rhandom_2: :Aamir will give  }).click(function().appendTo(map){ a try
11:21  Aamir: rhandom_2:   }).click(function(){}).appendTo(map);
11:29  jds: Turns out that css bug isn't just Chrome : I can very occasionally reproduce it in Safari, but it seems much rarer than in Chrome.
11:30  jds: Just to confirm I'm not going crazy, would someone mind loading http://boos.audioboo.fm/test/cssheight.html and check that it does occasionally show "got height 0" on the first page load?
11:30  ss23: got height 50px
11:30  ss23: Oh
11:30  ss23: jds: I got 0 on the third refresh
11:31  ss23: Chrome beta channel
11:31  jds: I can't figure out if clearing caches helps reproduce it or if I'm just imagining patterns
11:32  russinkungen: jds: only worked on the first refresh, got 0px ever other time.
11:32  russinkungen: in chrome.
11:33  ^jt: sames
11:33  jds: Ugh, weird.
11:33  Dartfall: jds, using Firefox 4 beta 8 and I got 0 height on the 3rd refresh too
11:33  jds: You'd definitely expect css to be active in the page by the time $(document).ready fires, right?
11:33  Tomashe: hey guys i want to do toggle on checkbox check
11:33  Tomashe: how do i do it
11:33  Tomashe: if checked already do x it not do y
11:34  mahen23: hello
11:34  jds: The problem seems to go away if I include the css before the script tag, but I didn't think that was necessary
11:34  mahen23: can i put an <img> tag inside a <span> ?
11:34  jds: mahen23: yes
11:34  mahen23: oh ok
11:35  Tomashe: anyone can help me ?

11:35  russinkungen: ?
11:35  jds: Tomashe:  It's off the top of my head, but maybe $('#mycheckbox').is(':checked')  ?

11:40  jds: ah.   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jul/0648.html
11:41  jds: So it sounds like if a stylesheet has no <script> tags after it, that stylesheet might not be loaded by the time DOMContentLoaded fires

12:34  sdgsdg: Hi, I use several UL lists in a 2 week calendar script I'm working on. I made the UL's for each day droppable, and the LI events for each day sortable so I can drag them between days/ULs.  My problem arise when I drop events the UL kind of expands to make room, but if I drop it in that space I can't catch the event that it's been dropped.
12:35  Dartfall: How do I make the fade not repeat itself if moused over on and off really fast? 92.80.226.51
12:35  Dartfall: * http://92.80.226.51/
12:36  sean`: ?stop @ Dartfall
12:36  bot-t: Dartfall, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
12:36  sdgsdg: If I on the other hand drop the event/LI on another already existing event or at the UL top, where I got static text, it catches the drop action and I can send AJAX to change event date in the db.. So, how do I turn off this "expanding", or atleast catch if the obejct has been dropped there?
12:37  Dartfall: sean', nothing happens if I put .stop().fadeTo(). ( no settings on stop() because I saw someone do it that way )
12:39  sdgsdg: Someone know of good or better documentation for sortable/dropable jquery UI?  The official site doesn't contain much on the subject
12:40  burg: how can i trigger click on <input type="file"> using jquery?
12:40  Kambfhase: burg $(input).click()
12:42  sac_: sdgsdg, to be honest it contains everything you need at least i was able to implement it even with nested lists
12:42  burg: Kambfhase, this doesn`t work if input type is "file"
12:42  Kambfhase: hmmmm, ...
12:45  sdgsdg: Well, dragging LI's from one UL to another works great as they showed... But it's when I implemented the code for "drop: function(event, ui) {" .... that uses AJAX for saving the new position that it all breaks down.
12:46  Kambfhase: burg works for me in Fx 3.6
12:47  sdgsdg: I need a way to "turn off" jsquery expanding the UL height when dragging... Becasue the drop/AJAX code doesn't run when dropped outside another LI in that UL. :S
12:48  burg: Kambfhase, so $(document).ready(function() {  $('#fileInput').click()  }); will pop up the file browser for you ?
12:49  Kambfhase: oh, wait :|
12:50  Altreus: I've been looking at various tooltip plugins for jq but really I just want a plugin that says, position $(selector) relative to $(other_selector) and display it. What should I be looking for?
12:51  Altreus: obviously I can use show(), so it's the positioning I need to get
12:51  Altreus: Most of the tooltip plugins have been spazzing out about the position, i.e. getting it completely wrong
12:51  sdgsdg: Problem is viewable on:    http://pastehtml.com/view/1crvh0c.html
12:51  sdgsdg: as you can see, you get pop-ups when dropped on top of other LI or UL title
12:52  sdgsdg: but when dropped in the empty space provided and not overlapping with another LI, no popups appear, and the drop doesn't register
12:52  Kambfhase: burg, i am stilll googling but it seems like it is not possible.
12:54  Kambfhase: It wont work in Fx 3.6 but in 4

13:05  rhandom_2: http://javascript.pastebin.com/ep3qUGXd line 128-150 after appending to selector click fadein() and fadeout() not longer runs after three times zooming in and out in IE7/8
13:05  rhandom_2: Is this perhaps a loss of scope issue with $(this).siblings().fadeOut(); on line 140 of http://javascript.pastebin.com/ep3qUGXd (same zoommap.js file)
13:06  sdgsdg: the thing is it feel slike i'm using the wrong elements, i've tried changing it.. making ".item" the sortable instead of ".droplist" and so on, but this is as close as I get
13:06  mastro: is there a script to add a custom bookmark (defining the title and the link) on every browser?
13:07  mastro: like simulating the CTRL+D pressure
13:07  rhandom_2: :Aamir still around?
13:07  Aamir: rhandom_2:  :)
13:08  Aamir: mastro:  i don't think so you can do it hiddenly with js
13:09  rhandom_2: :Aamir! Reversed code as suggested, but after using the map and zooming into and out of region 2 the third time script stopped working after appending click(). No zoom/fading took place, but all regions and bulltes were hidden as requested. This all happens in IE, not FF
13:10  mastro: Aaaarg, I see... i've read chrome do not support any javascript function to add a bookmar, by design.. and every browser do it in it's own way..... firefox do not allow you to create a "real" bookmark and so on... I asked just to check if this is actually right
13:10  Aamir: rhandom_2:  its impossible for me to debug the code by just watching the code
13:10  Aamir: :(
13:11  rhandom_2: Well I could give link to WP site and a user and login so you can see front end (in maintenance mode now..
13:11  rhandom_2: where could I send username and pass + url to?
13:11  Aamir: rhandom_2:  i dont have ie at the moment :/
13:11  rhandom_2: I would really appreciate your help Aamir
13:11  Aamir: rhandom_2:  yes do it
13:11  Aamir: i will spend 5 mins to see if i can get something

13:12  coops89: when I use jquery ui dialog with modal enabled I can't seem to disable it after the dialog has open. I have tried everything.
13:12  coops89: (I want to remove the modal overlay)
13:13  coops89: when a user clicks it
13:13  Aamir: coops89:  you want to remove just the overlay when user click it ?
13:13  coops89: yes
13:13  Aamir: not the dialog ?
13:13  coops89: just detaching the overlay from the DOM leaves some  handlers that block clicks and text select
13:13  coops89: yes
13:13  rhandom_2: :Aaamir ok opened private chat and send details
13:14  rhandom_2: sent*
13:14  Aamir: coops89:  after you do .dialog....   you can try    $('.ui-widget-overlay:last').click(function(){ $(this).remove() })
13:16  coops89: Aamir: that's what I'm doing (but using detach) but as I said it leaves handlers that block clicks and text select
13:16  Mossz: JKarsrud ?
13:16  Kambfhase: sdgsdg: i am getting closer to the solution!
13:16  JKarsrud: Mossz: yeah?
13:16  Mossz: http://jsfiddle.net/S7fvU/
13:17  Mossz: here it is working :/
13:17  Mossz: so i dont know what is wrong at my side
13:17  Mossz: what could it be >
13:17  Aamir: coops89: no it will not. I tried it and i can select text and can click anything. inspect in firebug and you will see noting blocking the clicks.
13:18  pallet: anyone help me with some syntax, I'm staring at it and can't see whats' wrong  jQuery('#psw3563box').css('background','url('+imagepath+'sealback.png)')
13:20  coops89: Aamir: wtf, it doesn't work in either firefox or chrome for me
13:20  coops89: using ui 1.8.6
13:21  JKarsrud: Mossz: well, what is $(this) ?
13:22  Mossz: this is making the problem
13:23  Mossz: when i alert this.val i get 70
13:23  Mossz: but
13:23  Mossz: when i remove it everything works perfect
13:23  Mossz: i guess it's something with the $(this).val()
13:24  Mossz: how can i debug it ? since when i alert it i get the right number 70
13:24  coops89: Aamir: what ui version do you use?

13:25  Aamir: coops89:  no idea why but again i dont know why you want this sort of functionality
13:25  coops89: Aamir: how can I debug what intercepts and blocks the click?
13:25  coops89: to delete it manually

13:46  sean`: ja, zie het nu :p
13:46  Altreus: why would $('body') *ever* be null?
13:46  Altreus: especially within the document ready function
13:47  Kambfhase: Altreus: $=function(){ return null)
13:47 * Altreus checks
13:47  x75: hi, a while ago I read about an animation, that would give the user a visual clue where something moved to. It would move a dashed rectangle box from one element to an other element. Can anyone remember this, was it a plugin?
13:47  Altreus: oh fucks sake, this looks like the prototype $
13:48  sean`: Altreus, $.fn.jquery
13:48  sean`: that will return your jq version, if it's not there, it's not js
13:48  sean`: jq
13:48  Altreus: sean`: Cannot read property 'jQuery' of undefined
13:48  Altreus: yeah
13:48  Altreus: that's strange because it's in jquery
13:48  Kambfhase: sam505: jQuery is undefined :/
13:48  sean`: Altreus, i dbout it
13:48  Altreus: I don't know what that means
13:49  sean`: Altreus, check your consol
13:49  sean`: e
13:49  sean`: it prolly doesn't include jquery
13:49  Altreus: I am checking my console. That's where I'm getting this from
13:49  Altreus: Don't be dumb. This is the second-to-last command in the whole document ready function and the entire bloody script is jquery
13:50  sdgsdg: Kambfhase: thats great, what did you try?
13:50  Altreus: It cannot have been working up to this point and not now without something weird happening
13:50  Altreus: Hell, the line is itself in a function that is called back BY jquery
13:50  sam505: kambfbhase, what do you mean?
13:50  Kambfhase: sdgsdg: i just tryed to check if that form has any handlers atteched to it, but it doesnt.
13:51  Kambfhase: fuuuuuu
13:51  sean`: sam505, what's the problem
13:51  Kambfhase: sam505: i just tryed to check if that form has any handlers atteched to it, but it doesnt.
13:51  sdgsdg: hmm, still i must have it wrong.. becasue even if it expands to make room for another LI being dragged, it should still react to the drop handling :S
13:52  sam505: sean: I have a form on my site, but upon submission it takes me to a blank screen instead of taking me to the front page again
13:52  Kambfhase: sdgsdg: move the drop handler into a separate drop function.
13:52  sam505: kambfhase I m googling handlers now, please forgive my lack of knowledge
13:52  Altreus: fffuuuu
13:52  sam505: kambfhase I just bought this and since it doesn't work I am trying to fix it :G
13:53  Altreus: I wonder whether I can put a break-on-change on a thing in Chrome
13:53  Kambfhase: sam505: you bought jQuery?
13:53  Kambfhase: sdgsdg: and then include this: jQuery( ".droplist" ).bind("sortreceive",function(){drop.call(this);})
13:53  sam505: kambfhase no? the the component for joomla where I should give my site some microblog functionality
13:53  Kambfhase: kk
13:54  sdgsdg: Kambfhase: yeah thats what I was thinking.. maybe i can handle the drop in the object being dragged instead of by the UL in which i drop?
13:54  seahawks7: anyone know what "connecting" means when looking at resources in Developer tools in google chrome? Trying to figure out why some sites dont seem to have this sort of latency
13:55  Altreus: jQuery != $
13:56  Altreus: wtf
13:57  sam505: kambfhase, sean, I think i now after 24 hours understand that 2 of the javascript are biting each other. But i am not sure. I don't know how to fix it. I tried redircting via a url shortner and it works, but then submissions arent recorded
13:57  Altreus: hm $ has never been equal to jQuery
13:58  Dartfall: OMG, GOOGLE IS DOWN!
13:58  Altreus: my console says that $ is this -> http://pastebin.com/ZBzsd7nE
13:58  russinkungen: mekwall: very stylish apple feel to it.
13:58  Kambfhase: ?down google.com
13:58  bot-t: Kambfhase, It's just you. - http://google.com is up.
13:58  Altreus: That's in document ready, which I do with $(function() {})
13:58 * Dartfall panics and grabs his rifle to have a fun end-of-the-world day
13:58  russinkungen: oh yeah, forgot to scroll down, that message was probably 2 hours old.
13:59  mekwall: russinkungen: i know what you meant though :) thx
13:59  Altreus: I have a feeling that the console is wrong
13:59  Altreus: oh
13:59  Altreus: That's odd - the console reports the above, but the variable watcher reports $ as expected for jquery
13:59  Kambfhase: Altreus: old version off Firebug maybe?
14:00  Altreus: Kambfhase: Chrome
14:00  x75: is .transfer() not in jquery ui anymore, or is it just missing on the ui documentation page?
14:00  Kasreyn: why can't you set inherited background-color to % of inherited value?
14:01  Kasreyn: like make it a shade for tr.odd tr.even
14:02  russinkungen: mekwall: doesn't ie have support for border-radius?
14:02  mekwall: russinkungen: nope :(
14:02  russinkungen: oh, thought they where first with it... probably mixing it up with font-face.
14:03  mekwall: russinkungen: ie9 will
14:03  russinkungen: Ah
14:03  mekwall: ie9 will support border-radius
14:03  russinkungen: I'm always omitting IE from all my tests, which is rather stupid since 95% of my customers use IE7 or 8.
14:04  pallet: Whats the correct syntax here  jQuery('#psw3563close-seal:hover') ?
14:05  mekwall: pallet: what you want to do?
14:06  russinkungen: I'm guessing $('#psw3563close-seal').hover(function() {});
14:06  pallet: that's it
14:06  russinkungen: ?hover @ pallet

14:11  sdgsdg: Could somebody explain to me what a drop helper is?  Thanks to the manual I know how to make one, but for some reason I can't see what it's for, hahah :P
14:11  Kambfhase: the page you gave me doesnt even load jQuery!
14:13  sam505: kambfhase I have it set on yes: Load jQuery
14:14  sdgsdg: Kambfhase: am i suposed to call the drop function "sortreceive" or is that some internal function/name used for something entirly diffrent?
14:14  Kambfhase: sdgsdg: call it drop
14:15  Kambfhase: sam505: http://lekjegesprekje.nl/#Schrijf my console says jQuery is undefined!
14:15  sam505: i just installed a newer plugin
14:15  sam505: could you try again?
14:16  sdgsdg: Kambfhase: thx, and forgive my ignorance :P

14:19  russinkungen: results seems the same.
14:19  sam505: it looks like it made the site 100x slower :S
14:20  sdgsdg: Kambfhase: hmm, when I did as you said, it works to srop as usual but no popups anywhere I drop.. so maybe the line "jQuery( ".droplist" ).bind("sortreceive",function(){drop.call(this);})" never gets activated?
14:20  faraway: i want to select nodes by using a namespace in FF 3.x this works without problems if i do jQuery("[ns\\:attrname]") but in ff 2 and 1 it does not work ... i'm i doing something wrong, or does this only work form ff 3

15:09  coachz: http://fpaste.org/iROw/
15:09  jY: chances are you aren't telling the ajax call you are getting json in return.. and its expecting a string
15:09  Kasreyn: i love jQuery UI eggplant :)
15:10  Kasreyn: eggplants rule
15:10  coachz: i do tell ajax to expect json
15:11  Altreus: goddamnit chrome
15:11  coachz: you no likey chrome ?
15:11  Altreus: If I put $('body') into the console it says null; if I do console.log($('body')) I get the body tag
15:11  Altreus: I thought Chrome's console was supposed to work in the scope of the current breakpoint
15:11  Altreus: Spent ages on that ._.
15:12  davidmurdoch: anyone know what objects are dereferenced with 0 instead of null in jQuery?
15:12  davidmurdoch: I mean: know WHY objects...
15:13  coachz: Altreus,  can you see your vars in Script tab / Scope Variables section ?
15:13  Altreus: coachz: yeah, that's what was bugging me. They appeared correctly in the var list, but they didn't hold the same values when I used them in the console
15:13  coachz: right

15:26  sdgsdg: and i still can't make it send the right info with AJAX if the LI is dropped on top of that stupid placeholder jQuery makes on hover
15:27  sdgsdg: I should never have touched jQuery to begin with... i always end up writing it from scratch anyway
15:27  mekwall: lol

16:00  pallet: basically how do I fiund the first char in a string ?
16:00  ajpiano: fwaokda, just upload to your server and include it in a script tag after jquery

16:04  Coyninja: I'm hoping someone can help me... Is there some sort of very simple plugin (Or method of doing this) that lets me bring up a menu when you mouseover an icon? I don't want some ul li mouseover menu thing - I just have an icon in a div with text in it, that I want a menu to pop up when you mouse over the icon.

16:08  pallet: in CSS can I change the angle of text, IE can I write text, top to bottom instead of left to right?
16:09  Coyninja: So to accomplish what I want, all I have to do is put the image in a div and add a hover handler to it so that when you mouse over it, it changes the div's style to expand...? Or is there a better way, the menu pop up below it needs to stay open when the user moves their mouse into it
16:10  ajpiano: Coyninja: you'll have to experiement

16:41  pingoochan: thanks a lot
16:42  ajpiano: pingoochan, ya bro, you have a global variable
16:43  pingoochan: can you make a quick and durty exemple, i can't picture it out ^^ Thanks ;)
16:43  ajpiano: ...
16:43  ajpiano: there's nothing to make an example of
16:43  ajpiano: when you declare a variable without the var statement
16:43  ajpiano: it is a global variable.
16:44  pingoochan: does it look standard or not? should i read some more tutorial before starting up? (sorry my english is not that great)
16:44  ajpiano: it is bad.
16:44  ajpiano: to have global variables.

16:48  Vorspire: so declaring a new reference variable without var makes it global and omits any "undeclared reference" errors? I thought var was always required, whether a variable was global or not depends on the scope it is declared in?

16:51  mekwall: what is "heavily used" for you?
16:51  ajpiano: Famic: nope
16:51  ajpiano: Famic: it has to be real JSONP for you to use jsonp on it
16:51  ajpiano: Famic: you can run it through yahoo pipes or something

17:08  Aristata: That just seems to be returning if it's checked or not, I need it to actually check
17:08  ajpiano: Dartfall, cause until you've tried to actually make a complex stateful plugin yourself, you won't really get why a common methodology for building them is important.
17:08  ajpiano: ?checkboxes @ Aristata
17:08  bot-t: Aristata, To set a checkbox to checked, do .attr("checked","checked"). To uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked"). To check if it's checked or not: .is(":checked");

17:31  minver: I use Jquery UI autocomplete but the popup menu is 1 px wrong vertically. Is that a common problem? Any ideas?
17:33  noaXess: hello..
17:33  noaXess: can icons for jquery-ui accordion also be any path to a custom png/gif?
17:34  ajpiano: yah just override the existing css class
17:34  ajpiano: .ui-icon-foo { background:url(foo.jpg); }
17:35  noaXess: ajpiano: directly in the jquery-ui css? or before accordion definitino?
17:35  ajpiano: probably in a different style sheet
17:35  ajpiano: so you don't have to re-apply that if you get another version of jquery ui theme later
17:35  felcom: ajpiano: do you use an IDE that Lints automatically?
17:36  noaXess: ajpiano: aha..okay.. see..

17:52  BlueSherpa: What does $$ mean in jQuery? Sorry, it's probably a basic question, but searching for an answer has proven a bit challenging in search engines
17:53  ajpiano: $$ means nothing in jQuery
17:53  ajpiano: $ is a shortcut to jQuery itself.
17:53  ajpiano: most of the time.
17:53  VictorCL: ahhhhIfound it U.u
17:53  VictorCL: there was a space in the id .. but stupid alert didnt put the space
17:54  VictorCL: thats why I coudnt notice
17:54  BlueSherpa: ajpiano: ok, thx.  So, what would this code mean then?  $$ = $(this)
17:54  bobbobbins: im using onbeforeunload to try to capture some data if a user leaves my site, but its firing off anytime they leave a page, anyone know how to either make that work for just when they leave my site, or another solution?
17:54  ajpiano: BlueSherpa: setting a variable called $$ to alias the jQuery object wrapping 'this'
17:55  ajpiano: ?$prefix @ BlueSherpa
17:55  bot-t: BlueSherpa, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
17:55  BlueSherpa: ajpiano: neat, so javascript can actually use $$ as a variable name?
17:55  ajpiano: yep, $ is a completely legit character to use in any context
17:55  BlueSherpa: very cool
17:55  BlueSherpa: thanks for the help =)
17:55  ajpiano: hopefully you will find other aspects of the language more cool than that ;)
17:55  noaXess: ajpiano: i can't overwrite.. i think the problem is CSS scope. i use two jquery-ui css one for system one for customize customers jquery-ui widgets.. i can comment out the icon in the customer jquery-ui css but it will be still loaded.. seems taht it will be loaded from the system jquery-ui css...
17:56  ajpiano: noaXess, just write a more specific rule
17:56  ajpiano: #myAccordion .ui-icon-foo { }
17:56  BlueSherpa: yea, I've worked with jquery a good bit, but most of what I use it for doesn't leverage the cooler features, so I'm starting to read through modules, trying to figure out why they do what they do =)
17:56  ^Lestat: jQ is just, awesome.
17:56  VictorCL: funny when setting disable to a textarea before send.. it doesnt send the textarea ¬¬

18:26  opdynamiks: it means "which has attribute 'show' with value 'true' "
18:27  opdynamiks: so $("input[type=text]") means all input elements whose 'type' attribute is equal to 'text'

18:37  TomY: would like to do something similar, only using client-side (hopefully cached) templates, rather than sending rendered markup down
18:37  tbeseda: Vorspire: I suppose I could loop through $('*') and record each element's events.
18:39  opdynamiks: kantxx: did you use jQuery to bind the 'change' event to the select element? trigger won't work if you use the old method, onchange="doSomething()"

18:42  Hopsy: and i have used this effect SugaSlide http://jsfiddle.net/GH3Mt/

18:42  kantxx: ah

19:16  HM2K: is it possible to add a digit to the end of every id on every level under an element?
19:16  Kambfhase: Aamir: Why is that Video in the Java Subsection, like srsly WTF DUE?
19:16  Aamir: Kambfhase:  no idea but i love it, its really informative
19:17  mekwall: gnarf: that .browser is not even needed
19:17  mekwall: deleted that section
19:17  Kambfhase: HM2K: $(yourElement).children().each(function(){ this.id+="42"})
19:17  mekwall: it was from a pretty old textarea autoresize
19:17  HM2K: Kambfhase that's only going down a single level
19:17  Kambfhase: hm, every Level would be slooooooooow but not impossible
19:18  HM2K: i don't see how else to do it, i need it for jeditable to give it a unique id
19:19  Ely2: hi hi
19:19  Yancho: Aamir, so the fadeIn() method uses the alpha() filtering instead of the opacity css proeprty?
19:20  Aamir: Yancho: jQuery will detect your browser and will apply which ever is appropriate
19:21  Yancho: Aamir, I'm using IE8 and it is using alpha(). If I change the CSS to opacity it works fine. Any idea how to go about forcing it to use opacity please?
19:22  Aamir: ?g jquery opacity ie8 @Yancho
19:22  bot-t: Yancho, javascript - IE8 jQuery FadeTo - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015395/ie8-jquery-fadeto
19:23  Kambfhase: HM2K: jQuery("[id]").attr("id",function( old){ return old+"42";})
19:25  swiggy: is there a way to select the parent of an element? I have a <selectbox> inside an <li> and i want to select the ID of the <li> for the selectbox and not sure to go about it
19:25  ben_alman: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f1no7/create_a_simpler_and_flexible_javascript_api/
19:25  ben_alman: ?parent @ swiggy
19:25  bot-t: swiggy, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
19:25  ben_alman: also see ?Closest
19:25  bot-t: .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
19:25  Kambfhase: HM2K: no, that last one was wrong: jQuery(yourElem).find("[id]").attr("id",function(i, old){ return old+"42";})
19:25  Yancho: Aamir, looks like a strange one ey? just to make sure we're understanding each other, this is an example: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel_suppliment2.htm - if you use developer tools on ie8, you see it is using filter: alpha(opacity-100); the image is with a black shadow. if you remove that css property and replace with an inline of opacity: 40 it works fine
19:26  HM2K: let me try
19:27  Aamir: Yancho: sorry dude cannot get hold of ie8 at the moment. is if you know the solution than whats the issue?
19:27  HM2K: Kambfhase f'kin' a, that worked :)
19:27  Kambfhase: :)
19:28  Aamir: you can try .attr('style','opacity...')
19:28  HM2K: $(this).find('[id]').attr('id',function(i, d){ return d+1;})
19:28  Yancho: Aaaarg, to get jquery to use that css rather than filter
19:28  HM2K: that's what i used, and it's real quick on google chrome heh
19:28  Kambfhase: And it isnt as slow as I thought.
19:28  HM2K: no, not at all
19:28  HM2K: rapid actually
19:28  karega: why would my source be loading jquery from googleapis if I have not referenced it anywhere?
19:29  Aamir: ?p @karega
19:29  bot-t: karega, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
19:29  HM2K: awesome, you're a jquery guru :D
19:29  Aamir: paste ur source code
19:29  Kambfhase: ben_alman: wow, thats a long article!
19:30  firebook: hi
19:30  ben_alman: yeah, i had a lot to say
19:30  ben_alman: but a lot of it is examples
19:30  firebook: i'm using simple modal
19:30  firebook: and i want to close it programmatically
19:31  swiggy: $(this).parent().remove();       ?
19:31  firebook: i use #('mymodal').close(); but it won't close
19:31  kantxx: hmm
19:31  kantxx: does this.val exist?
19:31  Aamir: ben_alman:  http://gyazo.com/1a91ac4886e1bd723fd6878955b59b0e.png
19:31  Kambfhase: kantxx: this.value
19:32  Aamir: ahh its this one http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/scriptjunkie/gg575560.aspx sorry
19:32  ben_alman: kantxx: if you're dealing with forms, you might also want to try $(this).val()
19:33  firebook: anyone knows how to close the modal?
19:33  ben_alman: ?val
19:33  bot-t: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
19:33  kantxx: ah
19:35  gnarf: anyone know if github will let you do README.html ?
19:35  gnarf: :)
19:36  Kambfhase: gnarf: nope, but reame.md
19:36  gnarf: nice
19:37  gnarf: just curious if its possible to put a demo page ON the github
19:37  ehynds: yeah, you can
19:37  Kambfhase: there is like `Github pages`
19:39  panfist: sorry for the basic question, but how do you mix selectors where some parts are variables and other parts are strings?
19:39  Michael: $('#' + myId)  ?
19:39  panfist: for example, i have a selector like $("#table-id tr").each( ... );
19:40  panfist: then for each table row, i want to do something to the first td
19:40  panfist: so the function in the each() would be like...
19:40  Michael: $('#tableId tr td:first').each( function() { });
19:40  panfist: function () { $(this + "td:first"). ... }
19:41  ehynds: $(this).find('td:first')
19:41  panfist: Michael: that just returns the very first td of the first row
19:41  gnarf: panfist: $('#table-id tr').find('td:first')
19:41  ehynds: panfist, also see $('table td:first-child')
19:41  gnarf: ehynds++
19:41  gnarf: ?:first-child
19:41  bot-t: :first-child: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
19:41  gnarf: ?:first
19:41  bot-t: :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
19:41  panfist: ahh first-child looks good
19:41  panfist: thanks everyone
19:41  gnarf: faster than :first too
19:41  gnarf: :)
19:41  panfist: nice
19:45  mightym: someone experience with getJSON ?

19:48  trave: anyone have a suggestion how to fix this line to be compatible with IE? : o.drag.start = [e.layerX,  e.layerY];
19:49  trave: o is my own object, and e is the drag event.
19:49  trave: ie apparently does not set layerX/Y
19:50  trave: is there an equivalent?
19:50  Kambfhase: :/

19:51  gnarf: :)
19:51  gnarf: i dunno about ie tho
19:51  gnarf: might be missing
19:51  trave: i always use .log, will try out dir. :]
19:52  gnarf: i dont even have a copy of ie
19:52  gnarf: so...
19:52  trave: yea, I had to install a VM last night to figure out why my widget isnt working :(
19:53  devinrolsen: I got a set of list items that has an overflow scroll on it with a fixed height. I bound keyup events for the up and down arrows to select the next and previous list item.. however the scroll bar never moves when my selections reaches the bottom and beyond.
19:53  devinrolsen: with out a plugin can I make the scroll happen when the selection has reached the bottom and or beyond?
20:01  rudyl313: What's the main use case for going $('selector2', $('selector1')) as apposed to used .find or doing a combined selector?
20:01  rudyl313: using*
20:04  eternicode: rudyl313, none, afaik, but you can use other things for the context than other jQ objects.  Raw DOM nodes, for example.
20:05  timmywil: rudyl313, does the same thing.  jQuery will use find internally with context and combined selectors
20:05  rudyl313: timmywil: ok cool

20:33  trend: what is the best way to add an evt such as blur() to both $("#a") and $("#b") at the same time?
20:34  trend: basically I want to merge the 2 results into 1 object then add an evt to that
20:34  delinquentme: trend $("#a, #b").blur();
20:35  gnarf: trend: od $('#a').add('#b').blur()
20:35  trend: doh! didn't even think about this way.. $($email,$inquery) is what i can use
20:35  trend: thanks :)
20:35  gnarf: trend: careful
20:35  trend: gnarf, oh?
20:35  gnarf: $("selector, selector") is not $(selector, selector)
20:35  gnarf: the first uses the comma as a css "or"
