00:23  heverl: I think the last line is also interesting. I don't understand this code.
00:24  heverl: It's like (#(function($) { startEditing() {} })(jQuery);
00:24  ngharo: try var foo = new startEditing(elem, options)
00:25  heverl: can you explain what the ()(jQuery) does?
00:25  ajpiano: heverl: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

00:26  heverl: I'm still getting startEditing is not defined...
00:26  coldhead: heverl: it's called an alman function
00:26  ngharo: heverl: $.startEditing
00:26  ngharo: maybe

01:23  Kenzor: found what i needed in the comments of the documentation
01:23  Kenzor: live()
01:24  jaredhoyt: Kenzor: checkout delegate() ;)
01:24  jaredhoyt: better than live() performance-wise
01:24  Kenzor: ooh
01:24  Kenzor: thanks :D
01:31  txt231: Is it possible to have transition effects only on selected areas when a new page loads?
01:32 --- danheberden|away is now known as danheberden
01:39  Kenzor: delegate is indeed better than live
01:39  Kenzor: thanks again for the tip jaredhoyt
01:48  Mage_Dude: jaredhoyt: Have you listened to The Official jQuery podcast?
01:49  Mage_Dude: Kenzor: I would use live() 95% of the time. Only after you have built the functionality you want and then profiled your application should you start to implement delegate().
01:51  Mage_Dude: Kenzor: delegate is 'better' performance wise, but,  if you're talking about spending an extra day working on implementing delegate to improve over live() it should be for a significant performance improvement. In most cases you're only going to gain a tiny improvement making it not worth it to use that function
01:53  timmywil: mage_dude, kenzor, i disagree, use delegate, it's the tiny performance improvements that add up and make a difference.  besides, delegate is live, just with a context.  Now, if you need your context to be the document, use live.
01:55  Mage_Dude: timmywil: But you can't possibly know whether you're spending time improving something that is only 0.05% of the application when if you profile it you'll clearly see, "Here is a case for delegate because it's taking up 7% of the execution time vs. I went from 0.07% to 0.05% that nobody will even notice"
01:55  hi8is: Hello Everyone =) Happy Saturday to you all.
01:55  Mage_Dude: Low hanging fruit and all.
01:55  timmywil: mage_dude, i just don't get your case, delegate isn't any harder to use, so why not?
01:59  Mage_Dude: timmywil: There was some reason for not using delegate in all cases. Now I'll have go go back and listen to the podcast to figure out why
01:59  hi8is: I have a small pain in the a** job for an anal client paying me a glorious $150.00. Oh joy. He is withholding payment until I can fix some "glaring errors" in Internet Explorer 7. God... Someone please help.
02:00  hi8is: If you go to: http://www.thepixelflow.com/clients/comatrix/portfolio.html and admire his ugly as f*ck design first
02:00  hi8is: =)
02:00  hi8is: Then click on one if the ugly as h*ll menu items ( like Educational )
02:00  qq99: that is indeed pretty ugly
02:01  hi8is: You can then admire his ugly as f*ck sub navigation.
02:01  hi8is: Finally - click on a few of those sub items - on the right in his ugly as f*ck video div - you will see some text appear.
02:02  timmywil: all delegate does is add a context to your event.  Live works by binding the event to the document and then using the target and bubbling up if necessary to find the right elements it should be working on.  So, if you set your context to some "tr" with delegate, you're only bubbling up until you reach that tr, just saves you the trouble of bubbling all the way up to the document looking for your elements.
02:02  hi8is: In IE7 you should be able to notice ( if you put your anal client hat on ) that the easing of the sub nav sliding up and down and the easing of the text in the video div on the right isn't completely smooth
02:03  timmywil: now, if you're not sure where your elements will be (for instance you want to operate on all links), you need your context to be the document, so you might as well use live, no point in saying $('a', document).live
02:03  hi8is: If someone could tell me how to fix this g*d d*mn mother f*cking piece of sh*t - i surely wouldn't have a heart attack in the comming decade and will thus be able to collect my mighty $150.00
02:03  hi8is: my gratitude will be eternally yours for helping me put this c*ck wad to rest.
02:03  hi8is: =)
02:04  cobexer: hi8is: disable the animation for IE7 completely and pretend it's unfixable in IE7 because of some bug that Microsoft oes not want to fix and f*** ignore IE (7) completely ;)
02:04  Mage_Dude: hi8is: Not working so great on IE8 either sadly...
02:04  timmywil: which would be equivalent to .delegate(document,
02:06  qq99: cobexer, I really like that answer
02:06  hi8is: Oh, the joys of microsoft =)
02:06  qq99: will use in the future!

03:16  ffxr: form.last1.value gives 100.
03:17  BinaryKitten: right
03:17  BinaryKitten: so inc1 isn't greater than last1
03:17  BinaryKitten: so..
03:17  Nomikos: ffxr: maybe you need the parseInt inside the comparison - if it's comparing strings, "5" is greater than "100"

13:48  cburgdorf: thats simply not true. You open the func unit test suite page. Func Unit opens your test page within a popup. The question is: Can you access the js libraries on the page beeing opened in the pop up from within your tests that are located on the test suite site...
13:50  aidan: open a console on the pop up, see what is being loaded
13:51  aidan: how would the page work at all if your external JS was not loaded?

14:04  piklu: is the channal dead?

14:09  piklu: like? what label u are talking
14:09  piklu: ( not so friendly with jquery )
14:10  russinkungen: there's a <label for="email" generated="true" class="error">Please enter a valid email address.</label> behind the textbox.
14:10  piklu: yes, so how to control that ? position and style?
14:10  piklu: i must control it via jquery, right?
14:11  stewart__: Kambfhase: http://jsfiddle.net/8xRuz/1/
14:12  Kambfhase: stewart__: should work.
14:12  stewart__: it works with somethings but not others
14:12  Kambfhase: o.O
14:13  eirikb: stewart__: http://jsfiddle.net/8xRuz/2/
14:13  stewart__: for example you can get html using .html() however when it comes to removing a class it does not work

14:16  stewart__: russinkungen:  nah sorry about my example.. it sucks.... i have the problem berried in 200 lines of code i did not want to bother you guys with it
14:16  eirikb: stewart__: Probably more understandable if you didn't get what I did: http://jsfiddle.net/8xRuz/6/
14:16  russinkungen: stewart__: ah, is there a closure issue with it perhaps? check if it's undefined.
14:17  stewart__: its not because i can access its html()
14:17  stewart__: its the correct object
14:17  russinkungen: tried wrapping it in $()?
14:17  stewart__: i have
14:17  eirikb: stewart__: Unless it's a clone :)
14:17  stewart__: same deal
14:18  stewart__: hummm clone you say...
14:18  nlogax: you're not calling someFunc in your example, stewart__.
14:18  nlogax: sorry if stating the obvious >_>
14:18  Kambfhase: begun the cclone war has!
14:18  eirikb: stewart__: Ref: http://jsfiddle.net/8xRuz/7/
14:18  stewart__: nlogax: yea i know like i said its a bad exmaple...the real code is aobut 200 lines long
14:20  eirikb: stewart__: Although instance functions can not be called from the outer scope, so the example give the impression that might be a problem
14:20  stewart__: should i paste the whole code?
14:22  Kambfhase: yep
14:22  stewart__: ok here it is http://jsfiddle.net/UPVMV/

14:22  russinkungen: ow, sorry, stewart__ :)
14:23  stewart__: its the line that is trying to bind the click event...
14:23  stewart__: that does not work
14:23  stewart__: russinkungen: sorry for what your trying to help me :)
14:23  stewart__: russinkungen: nothing to be sorry about :)
14:24  stewart__: its in the "createTabList" the click event is not getting bound... but i can perform other actions on the object
14:24  stewart__: its really frustrating
14:25  russinkungen: stewart__: wrote the wrong nick. hmm. tried .live?
14:25  stewart__: .live.. not sure i did
14:25  russinkungen: ?live @ stewart__
14:25  bot-t: stewart__, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
14:25  Kambfhase: stewart__: you are comparing jQuery objects.
14:25  stewart__: is that bad?
14:26  Kambfhase: yes, they are never equal
14:26  stewart__: oh :(
14:26  Kambfhase: ?eval jQuery(document.body)==jQuery(document.body)
14:26  bot-t: Kambfhase: ReferenceError: document is not defined
14:26  Kambfhase: jQuery(document.body)==jQuery(document.body) // false
14:26  stewart__: ah right i might to a compare on .html() then
14:26  Kambfhase: jQuery(document.body)[0]==jQuery(document.body)[0] // true
14:27  Kambfhase: stewart__: use .get(0) to get the actual dome element and compare those
14:27  stewart__: ah ok
14:28  stewart__: so .get() will get the element that the jQuery object is pointing to or the first in the case of there being many matching elements
14:29  Kambfhase: ?get @ stewart__
14:29  bot-t: stewart__, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
14:29  stewart__: ah cool... great i was kinda wondering how to do that...
14:29  stewart__: so to go back for a sec... any idea why the click event is not getting bound?
14:30  russinkungen: stewart__: I'm not sure to bind like that before you're appending the element to the dom.
14:30  russinkungen: *not sure if it's ok to bind[...]
14:30  stewart__: thats what i thought too so i tried appending it before calling the bind but i got the same result
14:31  stewart__: but the thing is if you use the jquery selector then the event binds with no issue
14:32  stewart__: so for examle the ".tab-select a" has no issue

16:07  k4v: inside the plugin i use the trigger function, that works, but when I suppy the additional data, i dont see it outside
16:07  k4v: the data field is just empty

17:50  webben: MindSpark: No.
17:50  MindSpark: what is it then ? I think in php that should work without closure... no ?
17:51  webben: MindSpark: It occurs because of how JS is functionally scoped, such that functions inherit the lexical scope of outer functions.
17:51  webben: MindSpark: PHP is a different language.

19:58  tellerfisch: hello, when is a jQuery document.ready function executed? after ALL elements (images and so on) are FULLY loaded?
19:58  johnline: yes
19:59  ajpiano: no
19:59  johnline: no
19:59  ajpiano: dom ready fires before images load
19:59  Kambfhase: ^^
19:59  johnline: howd you make it do it fires after imgs
19:59  ajpiano: you use window load instead
20:00  wookiehangover: or bind a load event to the image in question

20:03  zhannes: Hi all, question about the jquery cycle plugin. I have a tab navigation and I want to fire a callback when the content transitions. ( I don't want to add navigation dynamically using jQuery. Prefer to avoid the options.pager and options.pagerAnchorBuilder ). The callback for options.before fires really early when timeout is set to 0 ( manual advance with prev/next). Any ideas?
20:07  carpet_the_walls: anyone use jQuery validator http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation ? how do you specify where error messages appear?
20:08  hydoskee: ok - two identical html pages - the first rendered from a liftweb context: http://bit.ly/gmZr7g the second from plain html: http://bit.ly/dW1gBq  - identical HTML - any ideas why one would work, and one would fail?  the javascript in the first one doesn't load the image, and the javascript in the second one does, even though everything is identical
20:10  mightym: well thx anyway!
20:10  paul_irish: u bet!
20:10  mib_mib: if i have a countdown timer in javascript as such, how can i make it so that once i load the page, using firebug or something i could add more time to this counter http://pastebin.com/5hHuJ31S
20:10  paul_irish: mightym: wait up
20:11  paul_irish: mightym: can you pastie more of that line of code you're working with?
20:12  mightym: paul_irish: oh yes, wait a second
20:12 --- remote__ is now known as remote_
20:13  paul_irish: mib_mib: easiest way is to make the variable holding the total time global.
20:13  mightym: paul_irish: http://pastie.org/1467509
20:14  mib_mib: paul_irish: what i wish to do is add more time, even though i don't control the javascript
20:14  mib_mib: can i do that with firebug or something
20:14  mib_mib: as it seems that the countdown time is determined from a field
20:14  paul_irish: mib_mib: you can set a breakpoint inside of there
20:14  paul_irish: and edit a variable's value
20:15  mib_mib: would i have to turn javscripts off first?
20:15  mib_mib: and then turn them on or what
20:15  mib_mib: how can i edit a variables value
20:15  mib_mib: once its been set
20:15  paul_irish: mightym: this isnt using jquery at all.
20:15  paul_irish: and you're using the string.prototype.link function which like.. nobody knows about
20:15  paul_irish: HOWD U KNOW?!
20:16  mib_mib: paul_irish: inside a function, say, is a variable 'sec', say its counting down from 100, how do i set this variable that is inside the method to something else?
20:16  paul_irish: but the return of link() will be a string.. so you can't really add a attribute too easily
20:16  mightym: well i read about it, cause it fits on my needs, i need to parse links from a twitter tweet, ans it seemed quiet fitting
20:16  paul_irish: mib_mib: set a breakpoint with firebug to pause execution on it
20:17  paul_irish: and then in the console: sec = 90001;
20:17  mib_mib: ah
20:17  paul_irish: mightym: that's cool. well i would suggest ben alman's linkify script for that
20:17  paul_irish: but since you're already so close..
20:17  mib_mib: paul_irish: can i set a breakpoint AFTER the script has already began to run?
20:18  paul_irish: url.link(url).replace('<a ','<a target="_blank" ');
20:18  paul_irish: mib_mib: yup.
20:18  paul_irish: in most cases.
20:19  Mnkras-Laptop: can someone give me a hand making this: http://nakajima.github.com/jquery-livesearch/jquery.livesearch.js case insensitive? i have no idea how to do it,
20:19  mib_mib: paul_irish: i.e. i load the page, the scripts run, and i set a breakpoint using firebug, then the script stops, and when it stops its scoped inside the function, and me seeting like secs=10000; will scope inside the function? and i can just type that directly into the console?

20:34  iszak: danheberden, what?
20:34  paul_irish: i think he's confused.
20:34  danheberden: iszak - too much time on our hands?
20:34  NiftyLettuce: m0nkfish: depends on what you want to modify
20:34  iszak: did I say that?
20:34  iszak: I think there should be a mention on how you shouldn't develop your site in ASP either.
20:35  NiftyLettuce: m0nkfish: if there is another div inside that div that has an ID, you can just reference the ID
20:35  danheberden: <iszak> aka. people who have too much time on their hands.
20:35  iszak: danheberden, yes that is I.
20:35  danheberden: why make generalizations about things you don't know about?

21:26  Mnosh: i have a var status; out of my document ready function, and i can refer to this variable from inside the function
21:26  GreenRanger: Is there a common way to handle mousedown inside an element and mouseup inside OR outside the element?
21:26  rickard2_: '
21:29  Kambfhase: paste @ Mnosh
21:30  GreenRanger: I guess what I'm asking is, is there a jquery or javascript equivalent to the actionscript "onReleaseOutside"
21:33  Kambfhase: GreenRanger: how abaout adding an mouse up handler to the document and check if the target is not the element?
21:35  GreenRanger: Will that have a significant affect on performance since every mouseclick will be checked?  Or is that something the browser does anyway?
21:36  GreenRanger: hmm, I guess there isn't usually much going on when browsing a webpage anyway, so nevermind.
21:36  GreenRanger: thanks for the idea
21:36  Kambfhase: well you could $(document).one("mouseup",fn(){{}) on mousedown within your elelent sor the performance drop will be small

21:51  m0nkfish: i just want to preserve the original type

22:18  JKarsrud: info even
22:18  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, yes
22:19  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, thats what the code above pulls in

22:20  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, oops O>o
22:21  ngharo: MaxMeents: i'd create an array of objects for each media type
22:22  ngharo: i.e. foo.movies = [new Movie({ ... }), ...];
22:22  ngharo: same for music etc
22:23  JKarsrud: Nick_Meister: and even though the code for positioning the user_info link is after the ajax call, it will probably be run before it even exists
22:23  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, but why?
22:23  MaxMeents: but the problem is, that movies is one of 100+ top level categorys, and naming is going to be quite a paint
22:23  MaxMeents: pain
22:24  JKarsrud: Since ajax is async. The positioning should happen inside the success callback, or in a function that is called from success
22:24  MaxMeents: trying to come up with a dynamic solution
22:24  JKarsrud: MaxMeents: use object literals instead then
22:25  MaxMeents: can you loop through objects without knowing what y or z are in this ...  x.y.z
22:25  MaxMeents: like what if I wanted to know what  y is in x.y
22:26  MaxMeents: not the value but the key
22:26  Kambfhase: MaxMeents: use a for in loop
22:27  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, i moved the code into after the append, but i still get the same error tho

22:48  ngharo: joshsmith: yep

22:49  ngharo: haha :]
22:49 * joshsmith don't mind me. thinks out loud
22:49  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, so without any error to go with i dont know whats going on :S

22:50  JKarsrud: Nick_Meister: Are you sure the position is right, tho?
22:50  JKarsrud: And does it work if you make a simple example where you don't append stuff first, but just work on what's returned?
22:50  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, nvm i forgot to re enable a line now it works
22:50  JKarsrud: Goodie good good :)
22:50  Nick_Meister: but it seems to not work with resize tho

23:15  FunkyDude: I'm trying $.each($('.myElements'),function(i,e){ alert($(e.target).html()); } but it alerts "null"
23:15  parad0x: Try debugging $('.myElements') to make sure that's selecting correctly.
23:17  FunkyDude: nevermind, think i got it
23:17  FunkyDude: i could use $(e).html(), i didn't have to do e.target
23:17  kanzie: for some reason using the show('blind') throws my div off a few 100 px to the right, when animation is done it centers itself in position. Anyone know why this is?
23:17  charnel: how can I know if a element is clicked or not ?
23:17 --- ravenz_ is now known as ravenzz
23:18  FunkyDude: charnel:  $('.myElement').click(function(){ alert("yep, it's clicked"); });
23:19  JKarsrud: FunkyDude: $('.myElement').each(function() {}}
23:19  parad0x: @kanzie Try setting some CSS positions on the elem you are trying to move and it's parent.
23:19  charnel: FunkyDude: I have $('el1 , el2').click() and inside this want to chekc if the el1 or the el2 clicked el2 has 4 children and want to get its value
23:20  m0nkfish: hey in the following line:
23:20  m0nkfish: var req = $.ajax({url:"http://localhost/resortInfo.php",async:false});
23:20  FunkyDude: i didn't know you could use commas in the selectors
23:20  parad0x: Yep
23:20  parad0x: You just need to check the index against it's selector set.
23:20  m0nkfish: how can i use the local server address rather than localhost on the client machine
23:20  parad0x: $('.selector_set').index(item_clicked);
23:21  m0nkfish: (is there a way to do it using a relative path rather than explicit?)
23:21  FunkyDude: charnel, you could do...     if ($(this).hasClass('el2')) { do this.. }
23:21  charnel: FunkyDude: THanks
23:22  parad0x: @charnel You might as well bind two separate click events or use delegate with class selection to trigger a separate method. This will trim down your code and allow you to pass which elem was clicked into your handler.
23:23  agu10^: yeah, bind two separate chicks

23:28  James13433: for prototype whats the equivilent of $(function(){});
23:28  coldhead: take it to #prototype, seriously
23:28  James13433: Nobody speaks in that irc, coldhead
23:29  coldhead: there's a reason for that :D
23:29  James13433: cause everyone uses jquery like myself, but I need to use prototype
23:29  ravenzz: someone could you help me with a simple plain js issue? nobody answer to me on #javascript
23:30  JKarsrud: James13433: Never used prototype ever, but Event.observe(window,'load', function() {}); seems to be it
23:30  James13433: Many tanks JKarsrud
23:30  coldhead: document.observe("dom:loaded", function() { alert("The DOM has loaded!"); });
23:30  Nick_Meister: im trying to position a div at the center of the bottom
23:30  JKarsrud: James13433: Or document.observe etc like coldhead said
23:31  coldhead: lets hear it, ravenzz, while we're dealing with not jQuery
23:31  JKarsrud: http://snipplr.com/view/43645/prototype-equivalent-for-jquery-documentready/
23:31  Nick_Meister: so i used properties my bottom and of bottom but it does it
23:31  Nick_Meister: but i need it to be bottom center how do i do that?
23:31  JKarsrud: bottom center
23:31  Nick_Meister: cause its leaning against the left part
23:31  JKarsrud: just do it
23:31  Nick_Meister: i tried it ....
23:31  Nick_Meister: for my or of?
23:31  ravenzz: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ i need to submit that form after some seconds
23:31  JKarsrud: ravenzz: setTimeout
23:32  ravenzz: yes but what's wrong on my fiddle?
23:32  JKarsrud: or setInterval
23:32  JKarsrud: is no fiddle
23:32  JKarsrud: it's a link to jQuery?
23:32  Nick_Meister: i mean nvm,, its still doing the same thing :S
23:32  coldhead: try again ravenzz
23:33  Nick_Meister: i guess setting parent as 'body' would give these results
23:33  JKarsrud: Meh, I'm off. Work tomorrow
23:33  JKarsrud: cya later
23:33  ravenzz: coldhead :°
23:33  coldhead: show us the jsfiddle, ravenzz
23:33  ravenzz: lol
23:33  ravenzz: wrong paste
23:33  coldhead: oh there it is http://jsfiddle.net/WPjTy/
23:33  ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/WPjTy/
23:36  coldhead: ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/WPjTy/2/
23:36  coldhead: does that work for you?
23:36  coldhead: or work better?
23:37  coldhead: it uses an anonymous function but that's never a bad idea
23:37  cheez: coldhead: did you forget to actually count down
23:37  coldhead: not that i know of
23:38  ravenzz: yes it works
23:39  pie_: what does $('div.number') select?
23:39  ravenzz: so it need a function as 1st parameter
23:39  ravenzz: thank you
23:39  coldhead: ravenzz: what you had looked right, it should have returned the submit() function
23:39  coldhead: but that function is maybe special, so it didn't
23:40  coldhead: it was throwing an Invalid invocation error
23:41  RoaDin: okay issue i see with the code is the location you forgot the search in google.com/ part it should read google.com/search
23:42  GreenRanger: I used e.preventDefault() to disable dragging images and it works in FireFox, but not IE.  Any idea if there is a way to stop images from being dragged in IE?
23:44  ravenzz: coldhead where did you notify the Invalid invocation error throwing?
23:44  ravenzz: (sorry for my english)
23:46  coldhead: ravenzz: it shows in the Web INspector console for me in CHrome
23:46  RoaDin: ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/WPjTy/3/
23:47  coldhead: ravenzz: http://gyazo.com/d8425ed012d56ae6f5b9517c909a22bb.png
23:47  ravenzz: i can't find it on console
23:47  ravenzz: oh
23:47  ravenzz: i see
23:47  coldhead: can jsfiddle do diffs?
23:47  ravenzz: RoaDin np that was a test

23:50 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:50  pie_: How does the $('div.number') se;ector work?
23:51  coldhead: do you mean what does it select?
23:51  coldhead: or how does it work internally
23:52  Nomikos: Is there a way to swap two elements with an animation? Say I have a list of divs and I can click them to enable or disable them, how can I make the disabled ones slide to the bottom?
23:52  KucukMubasir: hi guys, do you recommend highcharts chart library?
23:52  pie_: coldhead: what does it select
23:54  coldhead: pie_: it selects any <div> with the class "number"
23:54  coldhead: <div class="number">this one</div>
23:54  pie_: aaaaaah i see, thank you very much :3
23:54  coldhead: <span class="number">not this</span>
23:55  coldhead: <div id="number">nor this</div>
23:55  pie_: so something like span.class would select spans with a class class
23:55  pie_: correct?
23:55  joshwins: Anyone know if jquery mobile is still set for release this month?
23:55  pie_: and asd.asd would select tag asd with class asd
23:55  coldhead: yup
23:55  coldhead: you're really getting the hang of this
23:56  pie_: lol
23:56  coldhead: div#some_id
23:56  coldhead: that's how you do IDs
23:56  Kambfhase: pie_: now what would foo.bar.baz select?
23:56  coldhead: well actually you just do #some_+id
23:56  coldhead: er #some_id
23:56  pie_: tag foo with class bar with class baz?
23:56  Kambfhase: \o/
23:56  pie_: :D
23:57  pie_: and the order of the classes doesnt matter right
23:57  Kambfhase: nope
23:57  pie_: but the first ting is always a tag if its just text
23:57  pie_: so like
23:57  pie_: foo.bar
23:57  pie_: ^thats always a tag
23:57  pie_: if theres no preceding symbol
23:58  coldhead: damn straight
23:58  aca20031: How might I add something to an element as a sibling to another element, namely before that other element. eg a list <ul><li>a</li><li>b</li></ul> if I have the jquery object to "b" how can I insert something before it
23:58  coldhead: jQuery just uses CSS selector syntax, pie_
23:58  pie_: and pie#tasty would select pie tags with id of tasty
23:58  coldhead: if you want to read up on them
23:58  pie_: coli dont know my css ;P
23:58  pie_: but k thx
23:59  coldhead: its worth your time!
23:59  Kambfhase: ?before @ aca20031
23:59  bot-t: aca20031, .before(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
