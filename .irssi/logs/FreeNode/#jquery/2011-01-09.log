17:48  vastak: Madmartigan, yes, .bind
17:48  elektrorl: and the url of my .js is : http://kernel-informatique.fr/sites/all/themes/archivescddbtheme/js/ddmenu.js
17:48  Madmartigan: just chain the binds?
17:48  Lumpio-: Why do you repeat the same code three times
17:48  elektrorl: you can preview the request when click on menu eric vigner -archives-
17:48  vastak: bind('keyup mouseup', ..
17:49  Jayflux: what are you trying to do Madmartigan
17:49  RTPMatt: ^^
17:49  Madmartigan: have an event trigger when there is text in an input
17:49  elektrorl: because i'm a noob and my code is in different layers
17:49 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
17:49  elektrorl: but i think it could be cleaner.
17:49  elektrorl: but i t works
17:49  russinkungen: Madmartigan: Do you really want the mouse to trigger the event?
17:49  elektrorl: for now
17:50  elektrorl: i'm learning jquery
17:50  Madmartigan: no i dont, but it might when used with UA autocomplete
17:50  Madmartigan: or copy/paste
17:50  elektrorl: why toggle on archives repeats?
17:50  elektrorl: it's the same jquery code for eric vigner
17:51  Madmartigan: so russinkungen, i dont care what triggers the event as long as it fires when theres text in the input
17:51  elektrorl: i think i'm missing something. the third cause is admin only but it works well too like eric vigner.
17:51  elektrorl: it's for the second item
17:51  russinkungen: hmm, wouldn't changed() be sufficient?
17:52  Madmartigan: let me try that, i think i tried it but let me see again, thanks
17:52  elektrorl: Lumpio: are u still on this?
17:52  russinkungen: ? changed
17:52  bot-t: russinkungen, .change() - Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
17:52  russinkungen: yay, I made the bot speak.
17:53  Madmartigan: not working
17:53  Lumpio-: elektrorl: Not really no
17:53  Madmartigan: only when lost focus
17:53  elektrorl: ok… if someone could check i think it's a ridiculous mistake
17:53  elektrorl: http://cddb.kernelwebcreations.fr/ and  http://kernel-informatique.fr/sites/all/themes/archivescddbtheme/js/ddmenu.js
17:54  Madmartigan: i see the workaround though, thanks russinkungen and bot :)
17:56  g0bl1n: shouldn't this be enough to get a password number of chars ?   $("user_password").val().length);
17:57  llynix: my click() doesn't seem to fire.  http://beta.buydentalequipment.com
17:58  g0bl1n: solved :-)
18:00  russinkungen: g0bl1n: yes. think you're missing a . or #. :)
18:01  llynix: $('a').click(function(){ alert('Link clicked'); });
18:01  OhaiBBQ: llynix put that in the dom ready callback
18:02  llynix: ?
18:02  RTPMatt: .

18:03  bot-t: .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
18:03  russinkungen: llynix: you try to bind the click event on $('a') before there are any in the dom.
18:04  llynix: gotcha..
18:04  llynix: this code used to live on the bottom of the page..
18:04  llynix: there were a's then :)
18:05  russinkungen: $(document).ready(function(){ $('a').click(function() { ... } ); });

18:05  llynix: thanks russinkungen it works now
18:05  russinkungen: llynix: exactly. you can just use that nifty .ready event and it shouldn't matter.
18:06  OhaiBBQ: llynix: that's because .live doesnt attach event handlers to each element
18:08  Pens: How can I just display a loading bar until the page is loaded then fade it in? .ready doesn't wait for the images to load.
18:09  naton: Pens: $(window).load() is probably what you're looking for
18:09  Pens: Thanks

18:18  Carneque: What techniques could I use to do something similar to these hover over menu effects in JQuery?  http://www.momkia.com/
18:21  Carneque: I see they're using the clip:rect css property, but it's not a sprite type of effect.
18:21  jrockjiggz: russinkungen: no this does not work
18:22  jrockjiggz: how would i find $(this).length in set of children?

18:25  p4km4n: Hello, I have a site at vapor.ne8us.com/music/ that I'm putting the finishing touches on, when you click a song with an "&", it turns that into an &amp;, which messes everything up when it uses this value to get the player's source. Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?
18:27  jrockjiggz: $(this).child[el] ?
18:27  p4km4n: is that an answer to my question?
18:29  jrockjiggz: p4km4n: no sorry
18:29  p4km4n: jrock, do you think you might be able to help me with my problem?

18:40  vitsaus: hmmm. i am starting to think, that jquery mvc framework wouldn't be so bad idea
18:40  vitsaus: in my own project, i currently use php only for updating data in database :/
18:40  Know1edge: jrockjiggz: what are you expecting to return?
18:40  Know1edge: the length of the html?
18:40  Know1edge: or the length of the name, id
18:40  p4km4n: I'm sorry, that didn't exactly work, how do I go back and convert &amp; to & using javascript or jquery?
18:40  Know1edge: $(this) is just the object
18:41  deanclkclk: damn man..I've been here for a month and not once when I post a question...someone answers
18:42  vitsaus: p4km4n: advantage of having active user community

18:48  Know1edge: jrockjiggz: .html() will do what you need
18:49  Do``: jrockjiggz: .index()
18:49  sean`: guest3489, yes
18:50  jrockjiggz: Do``: thank you!
18:50  jrockjiggz: Know1edge: thanks sorry if i wasn't clear
18:51  guest3489: sean`: How exactly would I go about doing that? I already tried this and it didn't seem to work: $('#myelement').stop().fadeIn(150).effect('shake', { times:3 }, 300);
18:52  carpet_the_walls: i am using jQuery UI, can anyone suggest an image lightbox please?
18:53  sean`: carpet_the_walls, jquery ui doesn't have a default lightbox
18:53  sean`: but there are a lot
18:53  sean`: colorbox, fancybox, lightbox a modified ui-dialog
18:53  carpet_the_walls: sean`: yeah, as i just discovered
18:54  carpet_the_walls: sean`: are they planning on adding one?
18:54  sean`: guest3489, I'm sorry, I mislead you, it's not possible, 'cause they events are in a quuee
18:58  Qci: is there a way to "grab" all the exceptions? somthing like: $('html').onerror = function(){debugger;}

19:12  abracsi: hi guys, is jqplot a good choice for a graphing renderer?
19:14  stygyan: hello guys
19:14  stygyan: anyone here using fancybox?
19:18  stygyan: dooooods
19:20  hdon: hi all :) what's the right way to run my form validation functions? i tried to bind to the change event, but that doesn't fire as frequently as i'd like. seems to only fire (on firefox) when the user's cursor leaves the control
19:21  nezZario: If I apply an onclick to a whole class of say submit buttons
19:21  hdon: abracsi, just guessing as i've never used it: the modularity of their underlying design sounds like they have made some smart decisions, so probably :)
19:21  hdon: nezZario, a whole class?
19:22  nezZario: In the code for it, how do I get the ID of the button that was pressed?
19:22  nezZario: several buttons at once
19:22  nezZario: ..
19:22  hdon: nezZario, event handlers in jQuery are applied to the subject of the event (like the <button> element) so that "this" refers to that element
19:22  abracsi: hdon, thanks. My only concern was whether it had been superceeded by something better
19:23  hdon: abracsi, ah, i should have realized what you were asking, heheh
19:23  nezZario: I don't need the actual element
19:23  nezZario: i need the name so i can parse it and find the container div's name
19:23  hdon: nezZario, well how do you get the ID of the element from the actual element?
19:24  nezZario: good idea
19:24  nezZario: i'll play with it for a bit
19:24  nezZario: i just suck at jQuery.. not so much the syntax/language.. but concepts are a lot different than a server side language
19:25  hdon: nezZario, ok, well this is not jQuery, but: element.id will give you the ID
19:25  stygyan: so i'll ask you guys later.
19:25  nezZario: well correct me if i'm wrong, jQuery isn't a total replacement for js?
19:25  jrockjiggz: $('#id').attr('id'); will give you the ID as string
19:25 * hdon hates lightbox
19:25  l4rk: nezZario: of course its not a replacement
19:25  nezZario: I see a lot of people say it is pretty much
19:26  l4rk: well those people are idiots
19:26 --- esparkma_ is now known as esparkman
19:26  l4rk: jquery just normalizes certain things cross browser to make your life easier
19:26  hdon: nezZario, no. Javascript is a programming language (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/a_re-introduction_to_javascript) and jQuery is an API that abstracts the Javascript programmer away from the fickle various Web Browser APIs of each browser
19:26  l4rk: and it provides a ton of convenience functions
19:26  nezZario: i know the technical difference
19:26  stygyan: Anyone uses fancybox on here
19:26  stygyan: ?
19:26  nezZario: :) but thanks
19:26  hdon: stygyan, lightboxes are stupid, sorry
19:26  hdon: :P
19:26  l4rk: with your last question, i'm dubious about that
19:27  stygyan: hdon, i know but i can't choose.
19:27  hdon: stygyan, can't choose what?
19:27  stygyan: whether to use it or not.
19:27  hdon: stygyan, well, it's probably an extremely simple api, so i say try it out, and it will probably be easy to switch if you don't like it
19:27  stygyan: client wants it, client pays for it, etcetera.
19:27  hdon: ahh, gotcha
19:27  stygyan: oh.
19:27  stygyan: i'm just asking because i ran into ap roblem
19:27  stygyan: and don't know if there's an easy way to solve it
19:28  hdon: neither do i
19:28  nezZario: indeed, I hate to pop my head into things
19:28  nezZario: but I HATE lightboxes
19:28  hdon: maybe if i could somehow extract a description of the problem from someone who knows what the problem is...
19:28  hdon: nezZario, :)
19:28  hdon: if i wanted a lightbox
19:28  hdon: i would download a Firefox add-on
19:28  stygyan: the problem is the following: is there a way to assign width and height to flash objects? one by one? but without using tons of jquery calls to the lightbox?
19:28  hdon: or a greasemonkey script :)
19:29  hdon: stygyan, oh, your lightbox uses flash? or you want to use a lightbox to display flash content?
19:29  stygyan: second.
19:29  stygyan: it displays flash and images and more.
19:29  stygyan: it's for a portfolio.
19:29  nezZario: i still don't understand the need for a lightbox
19:29  hdon: stygyan, you might try asking in a place oriented around Flash. i certainly dont' know a thing about it
19:30  stygyan: oh, i think it's more about the jquery aspect of it, but thank you anyway
19:30  nezZario: but i'm sure you've made up your mind, .. so I won't say another word on it :)  but just saying, maybe you should just make a separate (dynamic?) page for each, or even ajax it so it's flat on the page
19:30  stygyan: nezZario, me neither, but as I said...
19:30  hdon: nezZario, well, i think i could understand how a lightbox is a nice feature if my mouse could only have one button....
19:30 * hdon is so clever
19:30  hdon: nezZario, i recommend reading that link i gave you thoroughly. i have read it a couple times. it's extremely beneficial to read :)
19:31  hdon: nezZario, stygyan's client has decided upon lightbox. let's leave him alone eh?
19:31  hdon: stygyan, out of curiosity, why do you want to resize a flash?
19:32  stygyan: hdon, the client has got lots of swfs relying on masks and objects that go out of those masks and out of the normal boundaries of the object
19:32  stygyan: thing is, when you tell it the dimensions of the object, it shows all ok
19:32 * hdon observes the verbal humour of something called "Flash" in something called a a "Light Box"
19:32  stygyan: but in this case, there appear the outer elements
19:32  hdon: stygyan, masks?
19:32  stygyan: yeah.
19:32  stygyan: imagine the object is 640x480
19:32 * hdon doesn't know what kind of "mask" you speak of
19:33  hdon: is it some kind of funky shape thing?
19:33  stygyan: the objects outside of those 640x480 appear as well
19:33  hdon: to get a non-rectangular area?
19:33  hdon: objects outside?
19:33  hdon: oh
19:33  hdon: you mean
19:33  stygyan: a mask just defines what's viewable or not.
19:33  stygyan: rectangle or square or whatever :)
19:33  hdon: ok
19:33  hdon: so
19:34  hdon: your only problem is
19:34  jquerier: hello anyone there?
19:34  hdon: that the flash rectangle is the wrong dimensions
19:34  stygyan: exactly
19:34  hdon: jquerier, don't ask questions like that, just ask your question
19:34  hdon: stygyan, are you trying to reuse the same flash object or something?
19:34  stygyan: the only way to solve it i've heard of is making a separate call for each flash object,
19:34  hdon: a separate call to what?
19:34  stygyan: but there are 50 flash objects in the file
19:34  hdon: to instantiating lightboxes?
19:35  stygyan: ok, right now, with the 250 lightboxes i've got in the file, it's just a call
19:35  stygyan: no measures, no nothing, just a few params for animatin and so on
19:35  stygyan: if i wanted to give those other params, i'd have to make an extra call for each of them
19:36  hdon: does the lightbox have any features like "next/previous" or is the only feature open/close and open/close animations?
19:36  stygyan: unless there's an option or something
19:36  jquerier: ok i have made a script to get data from a mysql table and pagination with ajax. everything works fine but i want to know if this is good for seo. because in the pagination  the links are always the same like domain.com/index.php  how ill google find data from page 2 or page 3
19:36  stygyan: both, but right now it's set as only open/close.
19:36  jquerier: will google find?
19:36  hdon: stygyan, well if it doesn't have next/previous features
19:37  hdon: stygyan, an easy solution might be to hack inside the lightbox, find the element that contains the flash, and then write your own code to destroy the flash and instantiate a new flash
19:37  hdon: that would take only a few minutes probably
19:37  hdon: stygyan, i also found this on google: http://videolightbox.com/flash-lightbox.html
19:37  hdon: stygyan, nevermind don't click that
19:37  hdon: i didn't even read it i just assumed it was for this haha
19:38  digga`: hey hey ...I am doing a callback, and it is going through a loop, takes about 10 minutes, I want to update the screen as it is going through the loop, when I do $(#divname).html('dsf') when the callback is loading, it waits until it is finished to update the divs
19:38  jquerier: will google find data which is made with jquery?
19:38  digga`: I cant rly paste the code its prty big , I just need the $().html(') to work while a callback is loading
19:38  digga`: in a php loop
19:38  digga`: loop is in callback :P
19:38  stygyan: i was searching for it on google as well, but it seems i can't find it
19:38  hdon: stygyan, hey check this out: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/videoGallery
19:39  digga`: Im calling the callack using .post()
19:39  hdon: stygyan, i viewed source on the demos on that website and i found they had an obfuscated version of this plugin
19:39  jquerier: how about jquery and seo?
19:39  stygyan: i think i found the answer to my problem
19:39  stygyan: it's stupid, but it can work
19:39  digga`: then while the callback ...(php) is running in the background(the loop) I need to update the div with .html()
19:40  stygyan: calling an html file containing said flash, instead of calling the swf file directly.
19:40  digga`: any ideas? =]
19:41  hdon: stygyan, that website seems to combine videogallery plugin with another plugin called videogallery1, which i believe is their proprietary extension of videogallery. in the code i see it checks for an "rel" attribute to find the ID to inject the Flash object
19:41  martinchristov: hey guys. Can anyone gimme a hint concerning an OOP issue ?
19:41  hdon: stygyan, fwiw, there is no copyright notice on videogallery1.js, so you can use it probably
19:41  stygyan: thank you :D
19:42  hdon: martinchristov, sure, are you using jquery inheritance?
19:42  martinchristov: yes
19:42  martinchristov: I'm using something like :
19:42  martinchristov: $.fn.initZoom = function(){ ..... }
19:42  hdon: martinchristov, if you have several lines in your example, please use a pastebin or jsfiddle.net
19:42  hdon: ah ok
19:42 * hdon waits
19:43  stygyan: hdon, thank you very much.
19:43  stygyan: you're a gentleman and a scholar :P
19:43  hdon: stygyan, :D good luck satisfying your client!
19:43  martinchristov: and urmm ... afterwards, I want to access this object like so: $('#something').initZoom.VARIABLE
19:44  martinchristov: but I cannot figure out this object behaviour
19:44  hdon: martinchristov, i think you misunderstood me. jquery inheritance is a jquery plugin: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-inheritance/
19:44  martinchristov: oh. ..
19:44  hdon: martinchristov, but please continue
19:45  martinchristov: hdon, there's not much more into it. It seems I cannot access an object in this manner, and I wonder in which could I
19:46  martinchristov: I have once called my function: $('#selector').initZoom()    and afterwards I want to access a variable like: $('#selector').initZoom.opacity = 0.5;
19:48  hdon: martinchristov, ok, $.fn references the prototype object of all jquery results, so the result of any $() will have this as its prototype, and inherit its properties and methods. as you have written, $.fn.initZoom = function(){...} therefore $(...).initZoom will be always a function. setting properties on that function will probably not affect anything immediately in any situation. jquery folks don't use a lot of magic "setters" in their co
19:48  hdon: de (setters are properties which execute functions when you set the prop's value, instead of actually setting a prop value)
19:48  msafi: How can I modify the CSS properties of a selected element?
19:48  hdon: martinchristov, is "initZoom()" your own code?
19:49  hdon: ?css @ msafi
19:49  bot-t: msafi, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
19:49  hdon: grr
19:49  hdon: msafi, click the link
19:49  hdon: ?css2
19:49  bot-t: hdon, .css() - Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
19:49  hdon: blah
19:49  msafi: hdon, okay. Tnx!
19:49  hdon: msafi, np, good day :)
19:49  Pens: How can I show a loading bar before $(window).load(function(){  ?
19:50  martinchristov: hdon, yes, it is a plugin I develop
19:50  hdon: Pens, do you want the loading bar to show actual progress, or just indicate that loading is occurring?
19:50  Pens: Either I guess
19:50  Pens: Actual progress would be cool :P
19:51  hdon: Pens, are you using .load() to request HTML from the server and then show the content to the user?
19:51  Pens: Yeah
19:51  hdon: martinchristov, ok, there are a couple of design methodologies to consider
19:52  hdon: martinchristov, let me answer pens' simple question and then i'll help you
19:52  martinchristov: ok cool :)
19:52  Pens: Ha, I'm simple ;)
19:53  nezZario: wait
19:53  nezZario:  how do I use this to find the name of the element in jQuery ??
19:53  nezZario: or this period?
19:53  russinkungen: ?id
19:53  bot-t: #id: Selects a single element with the given id attribute. http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
19:53  russinkungen: hm
19:54  hdon: Pens, the thing is that $(window).load(function(){...}) does not load anything, it just runs your function when the page has loaded. is this what you want? if so, here's what i do: i make my HTML from the server to the browser show a loading indicator, then on $(window).load() (or, i prefer to use $(document).ready()) you can hide or destroy the indicator so that the user sees it is done loading
19:55  hdon: nezZario, the "name" and "id" mean different things on the Web. the ID is a unique identifier for the whole document (the page.) a "name" is usually for <form> fields like <input> and <select> and <button>
19:55  Pens: Yeah, I used $(window).load() to load all the images first so they all come up at once, rather than the html then the images.
19:55  Pens: How would I load the 'loading animation' first then hide it when everything else is done?
19:55  hdon: nezZario, if you have a reference to the HTML element (aka "node") just get the .id or .name property to get the id or name of it
19:55  chrisboom: Hey, using slidedeck based on jquery
19:56  hdon: Pens, IIRC $(window).load() does not load images or anything. i don't understand
19:56  chrisboom: why is http://namesnotnumbers.info/slidedeck/verticalslides.html working
19:56  chrisboom: but http://namesnotnumbers.info not working
19:56  hdon: martinchristov, ok so we have a few design methodologies to consider
19:56  nezZario: ok let me ask my question in code
19:56  nezZario: http://pastebin.com/K4EgqGym
19:57  jquerier: how about jquery and seo?
19:57  chrisboom: its probably cos im a fool
19:57  martinchristov: mhm ?
19:58  nezZario: var $this = $(this);
19:58  chrisboom: but ive copied the code, and im using the same libraries
19:58  nezZario: got it!
19:58  Aliv3: for delegate
19:58  digga`: anyone have any ideas on my question ?
19:58  Aliv3: how do you do textchanged
19:58  digga`: then while the callback ...(php) is running in the background(the loop) I need to update the div with .html()
19:58  nezZario: I was using $this it's $(this)
19:58  digga`: hey hey ...I am doing a callback, and it is going through a loop, takes about 10 minutes, I want to update the screen as it is going through the loop, when I do $(#divname).html('dsf') when the callback is loading, it waits until it is finished to update the divs
19:58  hdon: martinchristov, you are creating a user interface abstraction using jquery. this means you'll be manipulating the DOM to present the user with a display/interface. sometimes it makes perfect sense to represent the state of your user interface abstraction by using common DOM elements and attributes. your user interface abstraction, however, has apparently a notion of "zoom", which i guess is a number or a fraction (percentage) and there is
19:58  hdon: no convenient HTML attribute for that. you may also have other settings like animation duration etc., correct?
19:58  chrisboom: getting the error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'slidedeck' of null
19:58  Aliv3: what event is onload
19:58  Aliv3: i mean
19:59  Aliv3: what event is ontextchanged
19:59  Aliv3: whats the name of it
19:59  hdon: nezZario, i have read your pastebin. the short answer is: this.id will give you the ID of the button. the long answer is: please read A Re-introduction to Javascript, the link i gave you earlier. there are some basics you still don't understand, or you wouldn't be confused this way if you just read that page :)
19:59  martinchristov: yes. hdon, I've got several properties like so
20:00  chrisboom: someone having a look?
20:01  hdon: martinchristov, so the question becomes, where to put this "state information" about your user interface abstraction? you can use .data() to store a Javascript values on your DOM. for instance take this code:
20:01  nezZario: $(this).id returns undefined
20:02  nezZario: ahh ok i'll read the introduction because this.id worked
20:02  hdon: nezZario, not $(this).id. this.id. please read A Re-introduction to Javascript
20:03  hdon: martinchristov, var state = {}; $(domContainer).data("zoom-plugin-data", state); to retrieve the state object, use $(domContainer).data("zoom-plugin-data") and the return value is your state object
20:03  chrisboom: anyone?
20:03  hdon: chrisboom, if you can't be patient, no one will want to look
20:04  hdon: martinchristov, now you will have two kinds of state that your API will want to expose. properties that can be changed and do not require immediate action by your plugin, and properties which, upon change, your plugin must do something to reflect the change!
20:04  chrisboom: hehe soz hdon
20:04  chrisboom: sometimes the delay means someone is already lookin... patience turned on now
20:05  kenno: hello, little CSS problem in jQuery : http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8G7b/1/
20:05  Exterminans: Hi, got a problem with events in jquery. It seems like events won't be normalized in IE9
20:05  hdon: martinchristov, so you should create a means for your plugin users to call into your plugin with a "message" to update state
20:05  martinchristov: hdon. I am not sure I can keep up with you.
20:05  martinchristov: wait a sec
20:05  hdon: maybe i can create a simple example to illustrate
20:05  kenno: If you click ALL then All and Active goes red, but If you click again ALL i want that it gaves then different colors. But it is not working. http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8G7b/1/
20:06  kenno: sry for my bad english
20:06  martinchristov: hdon, http://jsfiddle.net/qNaY9/
20:09  Exterminans: Does someone know why this page won't work in IE9? http://brick.makegames.de/ All the variables in the alert() should be set after normalizing the object, but none of them are. Works just fine in Firefox
20:10  chrisboom: anyone?
20:10  snover: Exterminans: IE9’s developer tools will tell you better than anyone.
20:10  chrisboom: hdon: waited 15 mins hehe, patience enough i hope
20:11  hdon: chrisboom, i don't know what to tell you. the channel cannot support all plugins i guess
20:11  Exterminans: snover: Thought so, but there is nothing in the console or anything else
20:11  snover: Exterminans: I don’t see how var toldyou = false, if(toldyou) is supposed to help show you confirm your hypothesis.
20:11  snover: also your code is just wrong
20:11  snover: e = $.Event(e); var e = window.event || e ?
20:11  chrisboom: fair dos
20:11  hdon: martinchristov, i am very sorry i must run out for a few hours. please email me at don@codebad.com and i will email you a detailed response on how to do what you want as soon as i get back!
20:11  chrisboom: thanks!
20:12  kenno: anyone? If you click ALL then All and Active goes red, but If you click again ALL i want to give different colors. But it is not working. http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8G7b/1/
20:12  martinchristov: wow. thanks very much hdon. I was just about to run too...
20:12  Exterminans: snover: Outch, that would explain the problem^^
20:12  martinchristov: I'll hit you an email. Thanks !

20:15  foca: hey all, is there a nicer way to get an element from a label than $("#" + $(this).attr("for"))? haven't found a method in the api, but I might be missing something
20:15  p4km4n: Can somebody please do some optimization checking for me?
20:16 --- paulD is now known as beastman
20:16  foca: (assuming this == label)
20:17  p4km4n: I don't quite get what you're trying foca.
20:17  kenno: http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8G7b/1/  anyone care to look? If you click ALL then ALL and ACTIVE goes red, but If you click again ALL i want to give different colors. But it is not working.
20:18  snover: foca: In HTML5, the “control” property of the HTMLLabelElement points directly to the element that is associated with the label
20:19  snover: That’s not necessarily supported everywhere, so what you are doing is probably the safest (though you really could just use this.htmlFor).
20:19  Bartzy: ColorBox is blocking all future lines ?

20:19  libertiy: hi everyone i have install jquery/ jquery ui but is there a way to shorten .ui-button.ui-widget.ui-state-default.ui-corner-all.ui-button-text-only{:id => "", :role => ""} %span.ui-button-text  ?
20:19  libertiy: thats a whole mess of stuff i have to add in a class to get the wanted layout, is there  a way to make that shorter somehow?
20:20  jrockjiggz: i'm trying to use regex to seperate this string '1Hr 45Min'
20:22  foca: snover: duh, I forgot about accessing htmlFor directly :)
20:22  foca: snover: re: control, that's great, but yeah, even if I don't have to support IE, I do have to support firefox 3.6 :(
20:22  foca: thanks :)
20:22  snover: libertiy: that’s not javascript, nor css, so I am not sure what you are doing or how we are supposed to help you with that
20:23  snover: yup.
20:23  libertiy: snover: its just the class names
20:23  libertiy: in haml format that is, sorry forgot about it
20:24  libertiy: its just converted html the problem is i would like to shorten it
20:24  jrockjiggz: nm i got it ;-)
20:24  snover: This might help. See ?css101 @ libertiy
20:24  bot-t: New to CSS selectors? Here’s a tutorial: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/
20:27  monokrome: Does anyone know how to properly "click" the A tag here?
20:27  monokrome: http://jsfiddle.net/KGxXz/
20:29  snover: monokrome: that code makes absolutely no sense. at all.
20:29  snover: 1. javascript:void, do not do that.
20:29  snover: 2. don’t use context like that
20:29  snover: 3. target != currentTarget
20:29  snover: 4. triggering a click event is not the same thing as clicking on a link
20:30  snover: 5. use a :hover pseudo-class in your css, do not use js to do that.
20:30  cobexer: triggering click in onclick is no good idea either
20:30  Pens: If I had '.photo a img', how would I get from the img back to the .photo?
20:30  monokrome: cobexer: Sure it is
20:31  bot-t: monokrome, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
20:32  cobexer: monokrome: oh i see now, that on_click is bound to the li and the ul
20:32  monokrome: snover: 1) javascript:void is me testing. 2) why not? 3) thanks. 4) I know. If it were the same thing, I wouldn't be asking this question. 5) I use both :hover and .hover for support in older browsers.
20:32  monokrome: cobexer: right
20:32  monokrome: Sorry, no - it's only bound to the li.
20:33  snover: monokrome: what older browser do you support that needs that functionality?
20:33  monokrome: snover: IE6
20:33  cobexer: monokrome: $('ul, li') selects ul elements and li elements
20:33  monokrome: cobexer: and then filter('li') narrows it down to only the 'li' elements
20:33  snover: monokrome: I think you are confusing need with something else
20:34  cobexer: monokrome: sorry I'm blind today, I'll shut up now xD
20:34  snover: monokrome: Especially if you are trying to use HTML5
20:34  monokrome: snover: You are avoiding the question.
20:34  snover: monokrome: which one would you like me to answer?
20:34  snover: why not use a context?
20:34  snover: like that?
20:34  kenno: http://www.jsfiddle.net/z8G7b/1/  anyone care to look? If you click ALL then ALL and ACTIVE goes red, but If you click again ALL i want to give different colors. But it is not working.
20:35  monokrome: I'm trying to do something like: document.location.href = $(this).find('a').attr('href');
20:35  monokrome: in the end result
20:35  snover: window.location.href
20:35  snover: and that is exactly how you should be doing it
20:35  snover: or
20:35  snover: just set the href of the link and let the browser :\
20:35  Hopsy: omg
20:35  Hopsy: jessica-m isnt here :o
20:36  monokrome: snover: But that wont work with relative URLs, right?
20:36  Hopsy: i neeed someonee who can help me
20:36  snover: monokrome: why would it not work with relative URLs?
20:36  monokrome: If I set location to google.html
20:36  Hopsy: snover: haii btw
20:36  monokrome: Then will it automatically make it relative?
20:37  snover: ?tias

20:38  ajpiano: monokrome, for what it's worth, there's no point in testing anything with javascript:void(0)
20:38  ajpiano: it's like test driving a car by driving off of a cliff
20:38  ajpiano: just to see how the car deals with that.

20:39  draginx: How can I make it so that for every 20th object in a template it will insert a '<br />' ?
20:40  snover: draginx: define “object”.
20:40  draginx: snover, uhhh every loop
20:40  draginx: like I just need an index counter
20:40  ajpiano: monokrome, it's just that there's a difference between trying to make a link go to an href programmatically that is actually a URL,  versus void(0)
20:40  draginx: but i didnt want to pass that through json u know?
20:40  snover: draginx: not really :)
20:40  devinrolsen: how about you ajpiano, you any good with ipad touch events?
20:40  ajpiano: in other words, putting void(0) in any js example you show to ther people is a huge red herring
20:41  ajpiano: cause they'll get hung up on why its there ;)
20:41  ajpiano: devinrolsen: nope !
20:41  devinrolsen: yeah, me either.. stupid thing ignores basic JS laws :(
20:41  draginx: snover: http://pastie.org/private/jjfjqgj7puvzujlacy08q something like this
20:42  snover: devinrolsen: surely it can’t be as bad as Firefox’s mouse dragging behaviour, where you can drag off the window, release the mouse, and the browser still thinks you are dragging :\
20:43  devinrolsen: well yeah, that is true.. however my plugin relies on the parent elements width and height limitation to limit my animation effect.
20:43  devinrolsen: if it continues to animate while dragging out of the element in quesiton, the animation seams are exposed.. ugg
20:44  monokrome: ajpiano: Yes, I should have used a hash but at the time I was just not wanting to be navigated off of the page.

20:45  Aliv3: I syntax highlighted it and ie didnt get highlighted* why?
20:45  ajpiano: kenno: this is kind of petrifying
20:45  devinrolsen: I guess I am going to have to calculate and condition the event against the elements width / height + its offset from left and top against the touch coordinates on the page..
20:45  devinrolsen: yay for math.
20:45  ajpiano: Aliv3, is this a support channel for a syntax highlighter you haven't even mentioned yet?
20:46  Aliv3: yes
20:46  ajpiano: kenno, you need to test your condition INSIDE of the click handler
20:46  ajpiano: and also cancel the default action
20:46  ajpiano: and also use classes instead
20:46  kenno: I tried inside too
20:46  snover: ajpiano: ohai!

20:47  kenno: thanks!
20:47  ajpiano: kenno, the main problem is that you need to check the condition you're trying to test
20:47  ajpiano: inside of the click handler
20:47  ajpiano: cause right now your code says
20:48  ajpiano: 1) test a condition 2) if the condition is X, set the click to always do one thing 3) if the condition is not X, set the click to always do a different thing

22:03 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
22:04  mekwall: JKarsrud: nope, not just yet
22:04  mekwall: will come later on
22:04  JKarsrud: allright, was just a suggestion anyway =)
22:06  JKarsrud: *goes back to playing with django*
22:07  clarkfischer: Is there a way to access the contents of a loaded external <script> tag?
22:11  RTPMatt: clarkfischer: how do you mean?  You can load an external file in a script tag and use it...but i am assuming that is not what you mean?
22:12  clarkfischer: RTPMatt: Yeah, if I have <script src='app.js'></script>, there's no way (via the DOM) to grab the contents of app.js, right?
22:14  RTPMatt: clarkfischer: eh, what are you trying to accomplish?
22:16  JKarsrud: what do you mean grab the contents?
22:16  clarkfischer: The code. Whatever is contained in app.js.
22:17  RTPMatt: ...are you trying to do something you are able to do if it is not in an external js file?
22:17  clarkfischer: I'm writing a page compressor in node (using jsdom's jQueryify). I can easily load the files through the filesystem, I was just wondering if the DOM exposes the code more conveiniently.
22:18  clarkfischer: RTPMatt: The file is variable. It's up to the user whether the code is inlined or external.
22:19  RTPMatt: yes, my question is, does what you are doing work if it is not an external file?
22:20  clarkfischer: Well, I'm intentionally not touching inline scripts.
22:21  clarkfischer: I'm just searching the DOM for "script[src]", combining/minifying all the files, then replacing references with a reference to the minified file./
22:22  RTPMatt: eh...why?
22:22  RTPMatt: i am confused
22:22  clarkfischer: Optimization.
22:23  devinrolsen: is there a way to condition if an event type is supported by the browser or not?
22:23  JKarsrud: Hmm, you'll have to do something tricky to just read the external scripts
22:23  RTPMatt: would it not be better to compress the scripts before you try to render them?
22:23  BinaryKitten: clarkfischer you're using javascript to replace script tags?
22:23  clarkfischer: It's a node script.
22:23  BinaryKitten: oh
22:23  BinaryKitten: that's better then :)
22:24  BinaryKitten: was aout
22:24  JKarsrud: One way you could do it, is to download them temporarily while you read the script tags, and then minify it :)
22:25  clarkfischer: Yeah, I was just checking to make sure that the DOM doesn't reveal the actual contents of the external file. Instead I can just grab the files locally, compress and minify them, replace the references with one reference to the single .min file, then output the structure to a new HTML file.
22:26  serard: Hello
22:26  serard: I have a widget, I need to re init it, how can I do that ?
22:26  RTPMatt: serard: why?  what widget?
22:27  serard: A widget made by a software I use (diem, http://diem-project.org)
22:27  BinaryKitten: hmmm not a jquery widget
22:27  serard: I need it because I change some DOM via ajax, and this widget adds behaviors I need to reinit
22:27  serard: no it's not a jquery widget :)
22:28  JKarsrud: serard: Just reinit where you add the the modified content?
22:29  clarkfischer: serard: It pretty much depends on the widget. I'm guessing by behaviors you mean that it has some event bindings that you need to re-bind?
22:29  serard: yes, but how do I call this _init() function ?
22:29  serard: clarkfischer, exactly
22:29  serard: here is the code http://pastebin.com/uJDqpTPv
22:29  JKarsrud: which widget do you use?
22:30  serard: it's not a jquery ui widget, it's a home made
22:30  clarkfischer: serard: Can you call $('#myWidget')._init()?
22:31  serard: clarkfischer, no
22:31  Ganymede: Suppose I have a list of items, each with a unique numerical ID. I want to have a delete button of some sort next to each item (I don't want checkboxes along with a "delete selected items" button since I don't anticipate users deleting in bulk). I can insert a button like this: <a href="delete.php?id=13"> where that 13 is printed from the PHP script that generates the table. However, I want a confirmation dialog to pop up, probably with JQuery's
22:31  Ganymede:  UI dialog. I'm trying to figure out how I would pass around the ID number into the dialog...if that made any sense...? I don't want to store arbitrary data, such as the ID, in hard-coded HTML attributes since then it wouldn't validate and I have a system that automatically validates XHTML 1.0 before publishing...

22:34  beastman: i have a loop with a get request and im looking to update the width of a progress bar after every request, where should i put the width changing code, within the callback of the get?
22:34  Ganymede: dilvie, Yeah, that turned up when I Googled around. However, I'm not using HTML5 yet because it's still in it's infancy and at this moment, proper validation with XHTML 1.0 is important to me.
22:34  ajpiano: BinaryKitten: simple for everyone!
22:34  BinaryKitten: :D
22:35  JKarsrud: yeah, it's not hard at all, and you example was straight to the point ajpiano :)
22:35  mekwall: http://writeless.se/2011/01/jquery-ui-tooltip-widget/
22:35  mekwall: have fun :)
22:35  JKarsrud: Not sure if I like your global functions tho :P
22:35 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 92 seconds
22:35  JKarsrud: Though I guess jsfiddle is an exception anyway, as it probably wraps stuff for you :)
22:35  ajpiano: Ganymede: not using html5 data attrs because of fuzzy concerns about validating as xhtml 1.0 is silly. imo
22:36  dilvie: ganymede: Cool. Did you know that HTML5 is compatible with XHTML? =) We're using it in production on a site with millions of visitors. Works in at least 13 popular browsers, including IE6 and mobile devices. Backwards-compatibility is an important feature of HTML5.
22:36  clarkfischer: serard: Can you just rebind the specific behaviors you want to rebind? For example, if all you need is hotkeys, just call hotKeys()?
22:36  beastman: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csk2yKPltUc
22:37  ajpiano: beastman, haha this was the best sketch
22:37  ajpiano: of the entire epsidoe, probably
22:37  Ganymede: ajpiano, dilvie: Yeah...you know, you guys are probably right. I don't know why I'm so afraid of breaking validation or adopting HTML5...I should probably just do it.
22:37  dilvie: Ganymede: I agree it's silly to go hog wild and start using every cool cutting edge feature of HTML5, but the data- attribute is not going to cause problems.
22:37  beastman: haha agreed
22:38  ajpiano: Ganymede: yeah man... if you can't articulate why you feel you should stick with XHTML, you may as well jump on the html5 train baby
22:38  ajpiano: beastman, otherwise it was kind of middling epsidoe
22:38  Ganymede: Well we probably will want to use the geolocation stuff eventually, the earlier, the butter.
22:38  beastman: i watched the majority of it on mute in a bar, and i was still laughing my ass off
22:38  ajpiano: lol
22:38  ajpiano: i watched it on dvr
22:38  MatthewG: RTPMatt: hm, what's day of javascript on mobile? interesting
22:39  dilvie: Ganymede: one cool feature of the data-* attribute is that when you use, it, the values automatically become available to jquery .data()
22:39  beastman: must be nice, im stuck watching crap quality youtube rips
22:39  Ganymede: better*
22:39  ajpiano: eep
22:39  ajpiano: torrent that shit bro
22:39  dilvie: early butter?
22:39  RTPMatt: MatthewG: I don't really know this is about all i have found: http://dayofjs.com/
22:40  beastman: lol i was going to change my ways but screw it, anything for jim carrey
22:40  ajpiano: lol
22:46  Bartzy: Anyone know a jquery/javascript solution to the weird IE <button>:active background issue ?
22:47  Bartzy: or with a link: http://labs.findsubstance.com/2009/05/21/ie8-form-button-with-background-image-on-click-css-bug/
22:50  Ganymede: Oh yeah, while I'm here, does anyone else find Emacs23's Javascript mode (defaults from Ubuntu's js2-mode package) having a lot of difficulty doing automatic indentation for anonymous functions and JSON arguments, which are both used heavily in jQuery?
22:50  snufft: hey guys
22:51  RTPMatt: hi
22:54  beastman: i just got a hardon from my custom made progress bar.
22:55  Trisox: :|
22:55  beastman: that was meant for a pm, sorry chan
22:55  Trisox: lol
22:58  dilvie: Ganymede: I use textmate on mac, or vim. I was curious about netbeans for the intelisense support, but I'm holding out for a cloud hosted IDE with intellisense before I switch again. =)
23:02  astropirate: Why does this very simple script fail to execute? http://pastie.org/1443682
23:05  clarkfischer: astropirate: first, preLoadImages is called before it's created (not fatal, but you may want to look into it)
23:05  clarkfischer: second: cache is undefined.
23:07  yassine: hi all
23:07  RTPMatt: clarkfischer: i believe he is fine on calling preLoadImages because it is a named function
23:08  clarkfischer: RTPMatt: Yeah, it's fine (it will run), but it's not advisable.
23:08  RTPMatt: fair
23:09  astropirate: thank you clarkfischer!
23:09  clarkfischer: You're welcome, astropirate.
23:10  clarkfischer: RTPMatt: I'm fussy about that because JSLint is fussy about it, and I really try to stay as close to JSLint's recommendations as possible.
23:12  RTPMatt: clarkfischer: yeah, I don't follow all of jslint, but I do my best, I consider that a "follow it unless to does not makes sense to " rule
23:13  clarkfischer: I agree, but ever since I started using the jslint plugin for vim, I'm pretty much bound to follow all of it's rules. It's a fun game: code, then try to make all the red bits go away.
23:14  snufft: clarkfischer: sounds like debugging in firebug :P
23:14  RTPMatt: haha, i suppose thats fun ;)
23:15  clarkfischer: snufft: I'm a devout Chrome Developer Tools man, myself.
23:15  devinrolsen: jslint rules.
23:17  clarkfischer: Anyone have any compelling arguments for Firefox+Firebug > Chrome (as far as js development goes)?
23:18  RTPMatt: I think FB is better, I think the info it gives is better and easier to use
23:18  clarkfischer: One of my problems is that Firefox implements a lot of non-standard stuff
23:19  RTPMatt: then with all of the other FF development tools, i jsut find it much nicer than chrome
23:19  naton: clarkfischer: Chrome reloads its Web Inspector, as opposed to Safari/WebKit nightlies
23:19  naton: that is, when you open it you don't really get what's in your current window
23:20  clarkfischer: naton: you mean as far as DOM state?
23:20  RTPMatt: yeah, firefox also allows you to use words like "delete" without quoting them, this is annoying, as it breaks other places
23:20  naton: yes
23:20  RTPMatt: I need a "tell me when my JS will break in other browsers" plugin for FF
23:20 --- c4rl_ is now known as c4rl
23:20  clarkfischer: RTPMatt: Just look through MDC. There's a litany of "Only in FF6+".
23:21  naton: you really should check out WebKit nightlies after mid december, really cool Net tab (à la Firebug) with some extreme details available
23:23  clarkfischer: naton: Unfortunately, I'm stuck on windows (at least until I can find a thumbdrive so I can install something else on this blasted netbook).
23:24  clarkfischer: Safari on windows is not exactly a pleasant experience.
23:24  clarkfischer: Chrome's Timeline pane is pretty nifty though.
23:25  clarkfischer: Doesn't work out-of-the-box on OSX though, iirc.
23:26  Ganymede: Within an event handler which is supposed to show a confirmation dialog after a user click a "Delete" link (an <a> tag), I have used e.preventDefault(). Then, I use Javascript's confirm function to get a confirmation from the user. If the user confirms, I want to user to be directed to delete.php?id=<id-here>. If the user hits "OK", can I then...unpreventDefault() or something so the original href within the a tag is followed? I COULD use window
23:26  Ganymede: .location to get the user to the link after confirmation but I'd like to supply a relative link and it looks like that's be messy with setting window.location. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/Vkxjs/1/ (Sorry about the indentation.)
23:26  webben: Ganymede: I'd note in passing that using GETs to do deletes is fairly daft.
23:27  Ganymede: Oh yeah, you raise a good point.
23:27  clarkfischer: Why don't you have the link go to delete.php?id=<id>, and in the click handler, check confirmation and only e.preventDefault() if !confirmation...
23:28  webben: Ganymede: Why aren't you just using a form and submit? (or XHR post if it's JS-only)?
23:28  webben: Or in other words, start using the architecture instead of fighting it ;)
23:29  Ganymede: webben, Yeah...that's probably a better idea. I was so caught up in figuring out how to get this done cleanly that I forgot to think about whether a GET is even appropriate for this...
23:32  Ganymede: clarkfischer, Thanks for the suggestion. For now, though, I think I'll change this into a form.
23:41  Ganymede: So...it's a list of items, each with its own delete button. If I set up one form for each item, I need to call the .submit() submission handler N times, one for each form. If i wrap the whole list in one form with multiple submit buttons...then I don't know which delete button triggered the submission within the jQuery submit handler...?
23:43  Ganymede: In case it is not clear, I am pretty new to website development...

23:45  sean`: in your google async thin
23:45  beastman: how do i simply fade in a visibility:hidden div
23:46  mekwall: sean`: I thought about that, but read somewhere that it doesn't cache as well
23:46  JKarsrud: fadeIn() ?
23:46  beastman: yea thats what i thought, its not working
23:46  sean`: mekwall, bs
23:47  mekwall: sean`: how would I go about to set the async attribute? :p
23:47  mekwall: or it doesn't matter I guess
23:47  mekwall: since it will be loaded by ajax
23:48  nocomply: when dynamically loading stuf to #wrap, and then hiding the loaded stuff and loading something to #wrap that isn't as high as the first loaded, which is the easy way to set the #wrap's height to right?
23:48  sean`: ttyl mekwall
23:49  mekwall: cya
23:49  nocomply: I'm trying to use .height() but I think im shooting myself to leg with it
23:50  beastman: what is the most cross-browser friendly transition to use when showing something
23:50  beastman: as in fadIn, show(), animate()..
23:50  mekwall: JKarsrud: hrm, mind reweeting again? :P
23:50  mekwall: I messed up and deleted it
23:50 * mekwall is too tired :(
23:50  r3negade: Does anyone know if I can AJAX load a facebook button into my page rather than embedding a gross iframe?
23:51  r3negade: I wanted to just hide the iframe and use a link to .click() the button, but that whole iFrame thing doesn't work cross domains.
23:51  serard: re
23:52  serard: how can I set metadata using .metdata(key, val) ?
23:52  JKarsrud: mekwall: done and done :)
23:52  mekwall: r3negade: why are you using an iframe?
23:52  mekwall: JKarsrud: cool mate!
23:53  snover: mekwall: that’s how it works.
23:53  r3negade: mewall, it's the only way to embed it
23:54  mekwall: snover: was that about the facebooki thingie?
23:54  snover: yes
23:54  naquad: i've got this: $('table').find('tr td:contains("domain1.com")') but i need to actually select tr, not td. how do i do that?
23:55 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:55  mekwall: snover: ok, I thought they used inline code to inject data
23:55  mekwall: had no idea they injected iframes :P
23:55  snover: mekwall: it turned out that half the internet breaks when their servers went down.
23:55  mekwall: haha, nice
23:55  snover: so they stopped doing that.
23:57  draginx: is there a way to store a template in a file so it can cached?
23:58  draginx: rather than inlined
