00:01  BMCouto: Vorspire: open that link on and check the console pls
00:01  BMCouto: you will see that one of the json calls (despite the wrong url, goes with null
00:01  Vorspire: what link?
00:01  BMCouto: check your pm pls
00:02  Vorspire: ahh
00:02  BMCouto: Vorspire: got it?
00:02  Vorspire: yea
00:03  Vorspire: BMCouto, another tip is that you should start with a single . insteadof .. in file paths, otherwse it's going to look for a directory above domain.com (i think) that's why it's returning null still
00:04  Vorspire: (BMCouto): infact, you don't even need ./ at all
00:04 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
00:04  BMCouto: Vorspire: thats not the problem
00:04  BMCouto: problem is basePath is returning null
00:05  BMCouto: any idea why?

00:06  klj613: anyone got experience with .slider? i cant seem to initialise it, nothing changes. no errors occure either
00:07  karega: does jQuery have any core methods that will toggle an element's display property, animating it left and right?
00:08  Vorspire: (BMCouto): where is the urls.json file?
00:09  Vorspire: pm
00:09  karega: I'm trying to parse an immense amount of table data and I am getting an unresponsive script error from jQuery...
00:09  karega: Any rememdy to this?
00:09  serio: Hierofant, did you end up using my shitty Quicktime detection method?
00:09  BMCouto: Vorspire: got it?
00:10  Vorspire: ye
00:10  Hierofant: serio pretty much no.
00:10  serio: haha
00:10  serio: awes
00:10  serio: :(
00:10  Hierofant: I went with apple's method, then changed several things
00:10  serio: yeah
00:10  Hierofant: Because they probably are um, Apple specific
00:11  Hierofant: And Quicktime Alternative exists :D
00:11  serio: I would say the script I wrote was not reliable enough to use in production
00:11  Hierofant: I would say the same about most of what I wrote on this site, but thar she blows!!!
00:11  serio: but, it did the trick
00:11  Hierofant: Thanks for your help though, helped me learn
00:11  serio: learning is FUN
00:12 * Hierofant doing an architectural proposal now. sharpening pencil on $
00:12  Hierofant: I lost one project because I think I asked for too much
00:15  BMCouto: Vorspire: its ok right?
00:15  Vorspire: yea, trying to find the problem :)

00:24  dekhaus: Hi.  I'm trying to update some page content after a $.ajax called succeeded.   If I update the content using this call -> $('#home_page_toolbar').replaceWith("<div class='toolbar' id='home_page_toolbar'><h1>NVB-Seller</h1></div><a href='#logout' class='button'>Logout</a>");    it works.    If I update the content using this call -> $('#home_page_toolbar').replaceWith("<%= escape_javascript(render(:partial => 'home/toolbar')) %>");   it
00:24  dekhaus: not work.     Anyone have any idea why.   Thx
00:25  mjrlrjm: I'm getting "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #", which i assume is from calling $("#"), is there an easy way to find it?
00:26  erichynds: what is that suppose to match, mjrlrjm?
00:27  mjrlrjm: i think its happening in some code thats like $("#" + something) and something is empty string
00:27  mjrlrjm: firebug just doesnt give me a line
00:27  erichynds: bummer
00:27  karega: I thought UI was integrated into 1.4
00:28  ajpiano: that would only be a problem if you had ilke, so many different places where you are doing $("#"+something) that you couldn't possibly track it down yourself
00:28  ajpiano: karega, nope, completley untrue
00:28  eTiger13: dekhaus: what is that second part supposed to be
00:28  eTiger13: mjrlrjm: jslint
00:29  eTiger13: mjrlrjm: jslint.com
00:29  j0hng4lt: karega: It's the other way around. If you download UI, it will come with jQuery
00:29  mjrlrjm: ajpiano: looking around, there's a ton
00:29  mjrlrjm: eTiger13: thanks
00:29  ajpiano: your code sounds like a magical wonderland of joy, in that case :p
00:29 --- c4rl-afk is now known as c4rl
00:30  mjrlrjm: ajpiano: funny, i've never heard hell described like that
00:30  dekhaus: its supposed to load a rails partial
00:30  eTiger13: dekhaus: you want your js to load rails?
00:30  BMCouto: Vorspire: found something?
00:31  j0hng4lt: Speaking of UI, is it becoming a zombie project? I noticed that a lot of widgets are in planning but releases are few and far between
00:31  dekhaus: this is already a rails app with jquery running fine
00:31  eTiger13: dekhaus: ok well your rails code in your js tells us nothing. you need to see what the final outputted js is
00:31  erichynds: dekhaus, is that in an external file or somewhere where rails can parse the escape_javascript call?
00:31  Vorspire: (BMCouto): I think it's just the way the data is handled, i'm improving the base code, so i'll link you asap :)
00:31  ajpiano: j0hng4lt, no it isn't.  there were many releases this summer and the developers are working on fixing some API issues and stuff... as recently as earlier today
00:31  erichynds: dekhaus, also, what does it output?  what doesn't work about it?
00:31  eTiger13: j0hng4lt: 1.8.5 was released not that long ago
00:32  dekhaus: erichynds : yes
00:32  BMCouto: Vorspire: ok thanks, not rushing just checking if you're still with me :)
00:32  ajpiano: anyway TRAIN
00:32  Vorspire: ^^
00:32  j0hng4lt: ajpiano: Good to know.

00:37  poppiez: hi, I'm profiling a animation function I've made where I adjust some left and width values. an entry called camelCase() appears in the profiling. I know what it does I just don't know why it does it. can anyone elaborate on this?
00:40  snover: you know what it does but you don’t know why?
00:41  Vorspire: (BMCouto): http://www.jsfiddle.net/WvfM2/13/
00:41  Vorspire: (BMCouto): The code should be more efficient, now that i've familiarized myself with your data structures, etc
00:42  poppiez: snover: correct. I don't know why a camelCase function is being executed when running my animate function
00:42  BMCouto: Vorspire: thanks let me try
00:42  Vorspire: be careful when replacing the code :)
00:42  snover: poppiez: because animate functions on css properties and they need to be transformed?
00:44  funnylookinhat: Anyone here know a way to use the sortable <li> elements with jquery ui to submit their order to a form?  I'm not seeing how to access the order as adjusted by the user.
00:45  poppiez: snover: I see. alright, thanks
00:45  BMCouto: Vorspire: either its not working or im doing something wrong
00:45  Vorspire: (funnylookinhat): will calling .index()not access the new indexes of the moved elements?
00:46  BMCouto: how would you call basePath Vorspire ?
00:46  funnylookinhat: Vorspire: duh... of course.  I am not thinking today. :)
00:47  Vorspire: (BMCouto): var basePath = window.GlobalFn.URLs().basePath;
00:47  BMCouto: oh f*** missing the ()
00:47  Vorspire: (BMCouto): or var result = window.GlobalFn.URLs(); var basePath = result.basePath;
00:48  Vorspire: xD
00:48  csanda87: anyone able to help with using jquery to hide a div in a iframe?
00:48  csanda87: http://jsfiddle.net/uQB5F/
00:48  Vorspire: (funnylookinhat): maybe your hat is cutting off circulation :P
00:48  BMCouto: Vorspire: it comes empty :S
00:49  Vorspire: (BMCouto): It's really strange, if your urls.json is in that location, it should be working :/
00:49  BMCouto: yeah
00:49  BMCouto: its there :S
00:51  Vorspire: BMCouta: ahh, of course, i see an error that's not related to our code, in the script_global.js, line 186 - this will stop the entire script from running i think :S
00:52  BMCouto: Vorspire: console.log(urlResult) returns the object
00:52  BMCouto: Vorspire: but console.log(urlResult.basePath) returns an empty string...
00:52  Vorspire: (BMCouto): it seems that the $rating isn't defined in that context, is that code not supposed to be wrapped with $(function(){ .. }; //Doc.ready shorthand ?
00:53  BMCouto: it is
00:53  Vorspire: ok
00:53  BMCouto: so whats the problem? didnt understand
00:53  TechIsCool: anyone work with jquerymobile?
00:53  funnylookinhat: Vorspire: if I do a .each() on a bunch of listed <li> statements, taht would return them in the order as the user sees them, right?
00:53  Hierofant: theres a mobile #
00:53  BMCouto: Vorspire: what the problem with the $rating?
00:53  Vorspire: (funnylookinhat): yea, if you use the each's index arg
00:53  skrul: is there a way to bind an event that will unbind itself after getting triggered once?
00:54  TechIsCool: Hierofant: http://jquerymobile.com
00:54  Hierofant: TechIsCool:   #mobile-webdev
00:54  Vorspire: (BMCouto): you don't see the errors for the script_global.js in console?
00:54  BMCouto: Vorspire: i dont have any related to rating
00:54  BMCouto: i mean i have, the missing script
00:55  BMCouto: but thats because of this
00:56  skrul: oh i got it, one()!
00:56  BMCouto: Vorspire: i tried to remove that rsting code and do the console.log(urlResult.basePath)
00:56  BMCouto: it returns empty string anyway
00:56  TechIsCool: with 635 people I am amazed that no one has worked with jquerymobile
00:57  Vorspire: (BMCouto): i think the entire script_global.js needs re-scoped :/
00:57  BMCouto: Vorspire: not possible now :S
00:57  BMCouto: Vorspire: i think its getting this basePath: '',
00:57  BMCouto: and not the result.basePath
00:58  Vorspire: i think it's because it's asynchronous
00:58  Vorspire: well we don't need to use getJSON specifically, can try something else
00:59 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep

01:12  Praise: hi, what do you use as a unit test framework?
01:12  BMCouto: Vorspire: thats a big shot, but let me try
01:14 --- j0hng4lt_ is now known as j0hng4lt
01:14  Vorspire: (BMCouto): You'll be able to access the variables like this: window.GlobalFn.URLData .basePath or .login
01:14  BMCouto: Vorspire: seems good so far, two things, you commented the rating and its calling urls.json twice
01:14  BMCouto: why its calling the json twice?
01:14  Vorspire: odd lol
01:15  BMCouto: Vorspire: its working! =)
01:15  BMCouto: what exactly did you change?
01:15  BMCouto: and how do i avoid the json being called twice?
01:15  Vorspire: (BMCouto): my bad, was supposed to remove the json crap :P
01:15  BMCouto: ohh
01:16  BMCouto: let me see
01:16  Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/7bfwiuKX
01:16  BMCouto: which one did you kept? ajax or getjson?
01:16  Vorspire: I commented out the rating because it's throwing an error basically because the $.fn.rating() function isn't defined
01:16  Vorspire: keep the ajax call
01:17  Vorspire: the reason why I used $.ajax was to use the async: false option :)
01:19  BMCouto: Vorspire: I see
01:19  BMCouto: it works
01:19  BMCouto: thanks a lot!
01:19  Vorspire: awesome, np
01:19  BMCouto: really helpfull
01:20  BMCouto: did you did anything else to the entire script?
01:20  ceej: what's the best way to find out what type of input was clicked other than attr('type')because select doesn't have that
01:20  Vorspire: no, I just took out the break between the $(function(){ ... } ); in the middle of the script and commented out the rating
01:21  BMCouto: Vorspire: but you put everything on load
01:22  BMCouto: instead of the ready, why?
01:23  Vorspire: (BMCouto): actually, you have a point, I thought that all of the code in that script was supposedto pre-process everything before doc.ready
01:24  BMCouto: Vorspire: not
01:25  BMCouto: thats why i had thar separation
01:25  Vorspire: yea i realise that now :P
01:25  Vorspire: sorry
01:25  Vorspire: you want me to fix it up? :)
01:26  BMCouto: if you are with you hands on it :P
01:27  coldhead: that's what he said
01:28  Vorspire: lul
01:33  BMCouto: Vorspire: somestuff got pretty slow onload lol
01:34  Vorspire: yea that'll be sorted :)
01:35  Vorspire: (BMCouto): do you want the ratings UNcommented out?
01:35  BMCouto: Vorspire: yeah
01:35  Vorspire: ok
01:35  Viper550: I'm having some issues with a sort of "tab" system I'm trying to make
01:35  BMCouto: they are implemented already
01:35  BMCouto: and i use basePath on that
01:36  pifantastic: Viper550: go on...
01:36  Viper550: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/278645/ is the code. It doesn't seem to wanna work right
01:36  pifantastic: Viper550: in what way is it not working correctly?
01:37  Vorspire: (BMCouto): test-run this one: http://pastebin.com/h3DyhXAw - I can't do a live test obviously :P
01:38  pifantastic: Viper550: this design could be simplified a great deal.  And also note that jQueryUI has a tabs widget
01:38  Viper550: pifantastic, clicking on the top buttons (with css it looks like http://imgur.com/5R7L3.png) is supposed to make the sidebar switch between the different groups
01:39  BMCouto: Vorspire: rating is being called twice, one with the right link another with a wrong link lol
01:39  BMCouto: with the undefined on the path
01:39  wolfman2000: Evening. Does jsFiddle allow for including jQuery plugins such as the SVG plugin? I'm having an issue with the plugin, and the author has not responded to my email. I'm unsure which pastebin I can use if I can't use jsFiddle.
01:39  Vorspire: (BMCouto): by what means are you updating your file? Oo
01:39  danheberden: wolfman2000: as long as the plugin source is available to link to, it can be added as a resource to jsfiddle]
01:40  BMCouto: Vorspire: what do you mean?
01:40  wolfman2000: danheberden: It's split up in multiple source files, in a zip file
01:40  BMCouto: i just copy-paste the new code there
01:40  BMCouto: and test it
01:40  BMCouto: Vorspire: and its also calling urls.json twice
01:41  BMCouto: im not understanding how are you defining the ready like that
01:41  danheberden: wolfman2000: then unless you can find another mirror of it online, it can't be linked to in jsfiddle ( unless, of course, _you_ create that mirror and upload it)
01:41  ceej: man why doesn't .bind('click,keyup' worK????
01:41  pifantastic: Viper550: seems to work for me? http://jsfiddle.net/Xdqj8/
01:41  danheberden: ceej, cuz you can't do multiple event handlers like that
01:42  Vorspire: (BMCouto): $(function(){ ... } ); is the same as $(document).ready(function(){ ... });
01:42  ceej: danheberden why you used to be able too.....
01:42  danheberden: heh heh - you use a space kiddo
01:42  BMCouto: Vorspire: check the beggining of the file, that strange
01:42  danheberden: ?bind @ ceej
01:42  bot-t: ceej, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
01:42  danheberden: look at "multiple events"
01:43  BMCouto: Vorspire: you init $(function() a bunch of times
01:43  ceej: ah bollox it's been along day
01:43  ceej: danheberden: ty
01:43  wolfman2000: danheberden: I may have a way to get what I'm after. Give me a few moments please.
01:44  danheberden: uh.. consider them granted?
01:44  Vorspire: (BMCouto): yes, because some code requires to be ran on read, anything not wrapped in that will run on load
01:44  Vorspire: are you sure you didnt double up the code or something, when you pasted it?
01:44  BMCouto: Vorspire: why not just separate load and ready like i had before?
01:44  BMCouto: Vorspire: im sure
01:44  Viper550: huh ... it doesn't work on my local browser window, yet it works in jsfiddle. what gives?
01:44  BMCouto: want me to upload it?
01:45  BMCouto: Vorspire: im re-checking i have exactly like you gave me
01:45  Vorspire: ok
01:45  wolfman2000: danheberden: Don't think this will work. jsfiddle won't respect my HTML/SVG
01:46  danheberden: then off to testing locally you go :)
01:46  BMCouto: Vorspire: any idea of what might be wrong?
01:46  wolfman2000: danheberden: I have been doing that. I still am running into problems
01:46  Vorspire: tbh, no, but i'm revising :/
01:46  BMCouto: Vorspire: ok thanks

01:48  Vorspire: ahh i see some problems
01:48  pifantastic: Viper550: check for console errors?
01:48  Vorspire: BMCouto, some of the other code is calling the new code wrong, i'll fix that ;)
01:49  Viper550: pifantastic, I did, nothing
01:49  BMCouto: Vorspire: wrong how?
01:49  BMCouto: calling what?
01:49  nestoyeur: Hi
01:49  Vorspire: some calls still being made to the old window.GlobalFn.URLs.basePath
01:49  BMCouto: Vorspire: oh ok
01:49  Vorspire: (BMCouto): they should be window.GlobalFn.URLData.basePath
01:50  BMCouto: thanks
01:50  mgg982: What's up guys?
01:50  wolfman2000: http://jsfiddle.net/wolfman2000/vm9tQ/  Only using this for now. Assume the proper SVG jQuery modules are loaded via Keith Wood's website. What I want the code to do is scale up and down a set of arrows on a generated step chart. If I use the jQuery's animate function with this code, it eventually does this, but it first insists on scrolling down and right before coming back up to its proper location.
01:50  BMCouto: Vorspire: that means i should also create new vars for the other GlobalFn objects
01:50  Vorspire: wat do you mean?
01:51  mgg982: If I use .load to load in a PHP file in a div - how do I call jQuery functions on that div?
01:51  BMCouto: Vorspire: to access serviceLogged for example
01:51  BMCouto: cause im calling that serviceLogged on other script
01:53  BMCouto: Vorspire: for example cufon, menu and search should be on ready so they triggers as fast as possible
01:53  Vorspire: (BMCouto): yes, use: var result = window.GlobalFn.serviceLogged( data ); var success = result.success; var logged = result.logged;
01:53  Vorspire: they are on ready :)
01:54  BMCouto: Vorspire: ok :)
01:54  Vorspire: anything that assigns variables to $ or $.fn should be onLoad, anything that uses selectors to start should be on ready
01:54  Vorspire: dependng on how exactly you want those variables to be instantiated
01:55  BMCouto: Vorspire: yeah or any dependencies
01:55  Vorspire: yea
01:55  danheberden: wait.. assigning to $.fn on page load?
01:56  danheberden: anything on $.fn isn't going to require the dom to be ready
01:56  danheberden: it will be passed dom items when it's called - THAT call would be on domready of after
01:56  Vorspire: (BMCouto): I hope this does it :) http://pastebin.com/0u5uFeN8
01:56  SugaSlide: twitter wierd for anyone else aswell?
01:56  BMCouto: let me check
01:57  nestoyeur: I have a problem for sending an array var with the ajax post method. someone could take a look in my code: http://pastebin.com/1fDWQnS6 ?
01:57  SugaSlide: looks like old twitter :(
01:57  danheberden: dustin diaz said it was back at 1:53... hmmm
01:57  BMCouto: Vorspire: something is really weird here
01:58  Vorspire: ?
01:58  BMCouto: Vorspire: still calls the file twice
01:58  Vorspire: can you link me to your page again?
01:58  BMCouto: vor pls check
01:58  B-Tard: Anyone familiar with the ui datepicker AND fullcalendar?
01:59  BMCouto: Vorspire: in the console you can see files get called twice
02:00  BMCouto: Vorspire: and also some animations got messed up... isn't easier to just divide on load from ready
02:01  Vorspire: (BMCouto): it appears you've updated a script called script_recipes.js with the code from script_global.js
02:01  BMCouto: how stupid can i be!!
02:01  Vorspire: the script_global.js is perffect :)
02:02  Vorspire: but the recipes.js contains older code from script_js xD
02:02  nestoyeur: How must I send an array var with ajax post method ?
02:02  BMCouto: Vorspire: true
02:02  BMCouto: its allright now

02:05  superflit: hello fellow coders, I do have a google chart on a div using img src, how do I update this chart with jquery?
02:05  nestoyeur: Vorspire i'm not sure it's the correct way for my problem, because my array already exist. Do you think I must to serialize it
02:05  Vorspire: BMCouto, yea, serviceLogged(data) .logged or .success
02:05  nestoyeur: Sorry Vorspire I don't want to send this ... my cat push the ENTER key xD
02:05  kibibyte: im loading dynamicly some some stuff with ajax, but when i click my dynamic <a href the jquery code is not excuted . how to make it work?
02:05  BMCouto: Vorspire: not working :S
02:05  Vorspire: lol
02:05  nestoyeur: I go make some try and come back if it's doesn't work ;)

02:06  nestoyeur: Hum, the serialize method dosn't work on an array var :/
02:06  Vorspire: (BMCouto): yea

02:13  BMCouto: Vorspire: what is it?
02:13  khelll: i mean submit or image
02:14  Vorspire: BMCouto ust a couple of references to the old code :)
02:14  BMCouto: i alread put the ()
02:15  eTiger13: khelll: do you mean and and not or?
02:15  khelll: etiger13 or
02:15  eTiger13: khelll: why do you want an or?
02:15  khelll: to select either of both
02:16  khelll: input of type submit or of type image
02:16  eTiger13: khelll: so you want to select both?

02:21  eTiger13: Vorspire: why are there two  $(function() { ?
02:21  eTiger13: superflit:  obviously yeah
02:22  Vorspire: (ajpiano): I'm here to help :) I learn a lot every day too
02:22  Vorspire: (eTiger13): because I wantedto preserve the file structure so BMCouto could keep up with it
02:23  Vorspire: It's obviously a modular script, so I expect dfferent regions to be seperated in the future too
02:25  Vorspire: it's like using #region in C# to outline specific classes and sections in long code, using the search function CTRL+F for "$(function" wll allow you to skip to those points, just makes things easier to keep track of imo, I'm more partial to seperating "classes" into dffferent scripts

02:53  gussss: hi guys
02:53  gussss: I have an xpath like following:
02:53  gussss: "html[1]/body[1]/table[3]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[3]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[2]/td[1]/table[2]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[2]/td[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr/td[2]/a[1]"
02:54  gussss: and have converted it to following css :
02:54  erichynds: icek, you're in no conflict mode
02:54  gussss: "html:eq(0)>body:eq(0)>table:eq(2)>tbody:eq(0)>tr:eq(0)>td:eq(2)>table:eq(0)>tbody:eq(0)>tr:eq(1)>td:eq(0)>table:eq(1)>tbody:eq(0)>tr:eq(0)>td:eq(0)>table:eq(0)>tbody:eq(0)>tr:eq(1)>td:eq(0)>table:eq(0)>tbody:eq(0)>tr>td:eq(1)>a"
02:54  gussss: however the results are different
02:54  icek: ?
02:54  eTiger13: mgg982: i wasnt mistaken. you just didnt ask the right question or provide the right info
02:54  eTiger13: ?paste @ gussss
02:54  bot-t: gussss, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
02:54  erichynds: icek, banner.js.  you can't use $ like you are in no conlict mode
02:54  erichynds: use jQuery() instead
02:54  mgg982: no sweat tiger, thanks anyway
02:54  eTiger13: erichynds: where do you see noconflict at?

02:55  jerome187: can I access .find like an array?
02:55  icek: erichynds what i dont use $
02:55  erichynds: yes you do
02:55  gussss: okay repatsted my question
02:55  gussss: http://fixee.org/paste/l7iyk86/
02:55  eTiger13: erichynds: icek in the jquery.animation.js also
02:55  erichynds: icek: http://gyazo.com/66bfcb0e008f503d5dad19cd8e7e5a50.png
02:55  eTiger13: jerome187: for what purpose?
02:55  gussss: I just don't understand why that CSS path is not working. the Xpath and CSS differs, and they shouldn't
02:56  jerome187: to update a part of each element
02:56  icek: i replaced all $ with JQuery
02:56  snover: jesus christ
02:56  snover: gussss: are you kidding me
02:56  jerome187: .each(  and in there I need to update pieces of the elements, but not the whole thing
02:56  icek: refresh
02:57  eTiger13: ?paste @ jerome187
02:57  bot-t: jerome187, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
02:57  gussss: snover: the specifications are that I convert the given xpath to a CSS path selectable by Jquery $()
02:57  jerome187: v
02:57  jerome187: http://pastie.org/1239653
02:57  gussss: however that converted CSS doesn't seem to highlight the same elements as the Xpath
02:58  jerome187: this part is wrong $response.find('h1.right:first').html()
02:58  icek: etiger13 erichynds should i get rid of the no conflict stuff?
02:58  jerome187: cause its not looping though the result
02:58  erichynds: icek probably
02:58  eTiger13: what is $response?
02:58  icek: fixed it
02:58  jerome187: success: function(data) {
02:59  jerome187: v
02:59  jerome187: var $response=$(data);
02:59  jerome187: part of a ajax query
02:59  jerome187: its the whole page
02:59  eTiger13: jerome187:  why dont you assign that to a variable before the function instead of looking it up each time?
02:59  Vorspire: what is the advantage of prefixing variables with $?
03:00  Vorspire: i always write them without, or doesn't it matter?
03:00  jerome187: I dunno
03:00  ajpiano: it's a matter of convention
03:00  jerome187: eTiger13 assign what to a variable?
03:00  eTiger13: Vorspire: some people prefix it with $ to remind themselves that it represents a jquery object
03:00  Vorspire: i know some people have done it to define that hte variable is actually a JQ object
03:00  jerome187: this ? $response.find('h1.right:first').html()
03:00  Vorspire: lol
03:00  jerome187: that part is wrong
03:01  gussss: anyone have any ideas ? I am sure the CSS is correct translation from xpath
03:01  gussss: http://fixee.org/paste/l7iyk86/
03:01  Vorspire: (eTiger13): I guess I've never done it because I use a lot of PHP to output jQuery code to the page with certain PHP variables
03:01  eTiger13: jerome187: http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/Eakdk/
03:01  jerome187: should be something like $response.find('h1.right')[0].html()
03:01  Vorspire: $ in a string literal would conflict with php vars
03:02  eTiger13: Vorspire: no since php and js are executed at different times in different places
03:02  jerome187: thats not going to work cause that part is wrong
03:02  eTiger13: Vorspire: php is executed on the server and js on the client
03:02  jerome187: $response.find('h1.right:first').html();  is not right, it should be something like $response.find('h1.right:')[0].html();
03:03  eTiger13: jerome187: syntax wise it is correct. so if something is wrong, its in the structure that it is querying
03:03  jerome187: so find all, not just :first
03:03  jerome187: the loop through them also
03:03  Vorspire: (eTiger13): I mean, index.php outputs the HTML structyure, but in there, it loads/includes other PHP files (like menu's, etc) that also print jQuery code with the HTML
03:03  eTiger13: Vorspire: and?
03:04  Vorspire: (eTiger13): you told me howphp and JS wrk... I assumed you didn't understand me
03:04  superflit: eTiger13: figured the problem, I was using an django debug page...but jquery test the http return so it is an error it do not print...very nice
03:04  eTiger13: Vorspire: im confused by your statement
03:05  Vorspire: I can use the PHP variables to modify the jQuery code variables, basically
03:05  eTiger13: jerome187: do what? loop through the $response query and add the html of the matched elements to the second loop?
03:05  jerome187: yes
03:05  parndt: should I use document.write() ?
03:05  eTiger13: Vorspire: still not following you
03:05  eTiger13: parndt: not if you can help it
03:06  parndt: see, I always thought that too, but then I saw paul_irish doing it: http://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/index.html#L60
03:06  gussss: any way to directly select xpath ?
03:07  gussss: seems like translating xpath to css is not working properly
03:07  eTiger13: jerome187:  i dont know why you would do this as it seems like it would be a lot of bloat but: http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/Eakdk/1/
03:08  eTiger13: parndt: yeah like i said, not if you can help it. thats there as a fallback in case jquery cant be loaded from googles cdn, and its at the bottom of the page to prevent blocking
03:08  eTiger13: gussss: im still confused by what you are doing
03:08  jerome187: the :first is misleading,
03:08  gussss: eTiger13: I am trying to convert the given xpath
03:08  gussss: into a css path, which Jquery can select
03:08  gussss: as there's no way to direct support for xpath selections
03:09  jerome187: there are multiple elements in there, trying to update parts of each element with the matched element from the response, not the total of the responses
03:09  gussss: http://fixee.org/paste/l7iyk86/ --> xpath and css returns different elements. they are supposed to return the same elements.
03:09  Vorspire: (eTiger13): http://pastebin.com/6Brn0b0v - the jQuery code is echo'd with PHP - I can tell jQuery what the $POST php variable is
03:10  Vorspire: and cross-browser ajax is extremely easy to do, despite what everyone says :P
03:10  Vorspire: cross-domain*
03:11  parndt: eTiger13: that explains it.
03:13  eTiger13: ?xpath
03:13  bot-t: XPath Compatibility Plugin - Since XPath selectors were removed from jQuery in 1.2, a new XPath Selector Plugin has been introduced. http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2#XPath_Compatibility_Plugin

03:14  bot-t: Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
03:14  eTiger13: Vorspire: ok im not sure what your point is with the echo'd php but i disagree with your xss ajax
03:14  gussss: i managed to get the appropriate CSS path
03:14  gussss: http://fixee.org/paste/l7iyk86/#url=azzrraa
03:14  gussss: but it's strange why the literal  translation of xpath did not work
03:15  Vorspire: eTiger, all you have to do is make a .load call to your local php file that should be capable of downloadng page data from any given url using fsockopen or cURL
03:15  Vorspire: tada, done
03:15  gussss: there seems to be no xpath plugin for jquery 1.4.x
03:15  gussss: http://plugins.jquery.com/node/465/release?api_version[]=4693
03:15  gussss: returns empty
03:16  eTiger13: Vorspire: and this is better coding practice: http://pastebin.com/Zm1BXpDW
03:16  Vorspire: (eTiger13): no, it's opinion - that syntax appears messy to me
03:16  eTiger13: Vorspire: that doesnt always work and you cant make that portable as people may not be using php or have access to the backend for that
03:17  Vorspire: every web service supports php ..
03:17  eTiger13: Vorspire: and that introduces even more security risks
03:17  eTiger13: Vorspire: asp doesnt out of the box
03:17  Vorspire: not if you're a smart programmer?
03:17  Vorspire: .net incorporates the WebClient class
03:18  Vorspire: which can download other http requests
03:18  eTiger13: yeah. the point is that all of that introduces a lot more work, if it works
03:19  eTiger13: ajpiano flaw in Vorspire's theory: Go!
03:19  ajpiano: wat
03:20  Vorspire: (eTiger13): cURL can be scripted in about 5 lines at minimum, and php has a json_encode function for ajax return data, you can simply pass the url of the website you want to load as a argument to your local php file
03:21  Vorspire: if you just tell ajax not to autoParse, you can retrieve the entire document with that php file without json_encode
03:22  eTiger13: Vorspire: so you feel comfortable having a php page on your site that will attempt to grab **any** url/string passed to it?
03:22  Vorspire: it's less likely to be a security flaw if you use PHP to also keep an index of your local website file system, using sha-1 hashes to encode the paths, then the front-end user will never know where that sha-1 hash points
03:22  Vorspire: wich i have already developed and tested :P
03:23  ajpiano: Vorspire: having a server side proxy for ajax is one thing, having that you can pass ANY url to is kind of insane
03:24  Vorspire: but i wouldn't be passing a URL, the php with cURL will require a sha1-hashed string that will be checkedagainst the setrver-side cache for the actual url to make sure you're allowing it, kind of like a firewall... any malicious links that are not in your hash-cache will not be loaded

03:26  redman: hello all
03:26  Hierofant: hello
03:26  redman: i have a question about selector best practice
03:26  eTiger13: Vorspire: how do you control it when its coming from client side for a third party url?
03:27  redman: if a selector is only being used on one page
03:27  redman: should i use a php if statement to only load the selector when the particular page is displayed

03:29  eTiger13: redman you can test for it
03:29  ajpiano: redman: you should avoid executing superfluous code
03:29  ajpiano: redman, but you should probably also avoid generating parts of your javascript with php
03:29  eTiger13: you know you are a geek when you announce your babys birth in irc
03:29  Vorspire: (eTiger13): <a href="a1b2c3d4e5"></a> - i can do this by accessing my php cache like: echo'<a href="'.$SCRIPTS['URLCACHE'].hash("http://www.myurl.com/").'"></a>';
03:30  eTiger13: Vorspire: and then i can overwrite it in firebug
03:30  Vorspire: and using jQuery, i can override the onClick event for every <a> to submit a local ajax call to a php file that interacts with the URLCACHE
03:30  Vorspire: if your sha1 hash isnt in my cache, then good luck
03:30  redman: ok i understand
03:30  Hierofant: BFG - congrats
03:31  eTiger13: Vorspire: so you are talking about only using specific urls that you have already predetermined
03:31  redman: it is best to use a condition and only load the selector when the page is loaded that uses it
03:31  Hierofant: Why do new fathers smoke cigars?  They might as well.  Their lives are over.
03:31  Vorspire: yes, also the entire local file structure
03:31  Vorspire: the end-user never gets to see the real url's, ever
03:31  eTiger13: Vorspire: not exactly efficient or practical
03:31  Vorspire: <3 PHP
03:32  Vorspire: how is it not efficient?
03:32  eTiger13: Vorspire: and if you are doing that, you might as well pre-scrape the content anyway so its faster
03:32  Vorspire: load-on-demand is fine, no need to preload 500 links
03:33  Vorspire: that would be inefficient
03:33  eTiger13: having to maintain a list of urls/files. you basically are talking about having scraped content instead of dynamic content.
03:33  Vorspire: I won't have to maintain it because it's all automatic
03:34  Vorspire: recursive directory listings with PHP can list the entire structure of your website and hash every available path
03:34  eTiger13: if you are grabbing only specific pages and only those pages its not exactly dynamic. how do you take into account query strings?
03:34  Vorspire: the only thing that wuldn't be automatic is obviously the URL's, but it's no dfferent to specifying them drectly in the A tags
03:35  icek: hey for www.hathol.com/test/index.php how do i get the #pageflip img css to not affect the horizontal accordion?  if you hover over the page peel it will expand and you will notice two things... the accordion isnt on top like it should be but more importantly the pagepeel css is enlarging the accordion tabs
03:35  Vorspire: the query string keys are hashed too, while the values remain untouched
03:35  Vorspire: 1a2b3c4d5e?1a2b3c4d5e=Hello%20World

03:36  m4dv0y: i've an issue
03:36  eTiger13: Vorspire: like i said, your solution *may* work for you but its a lot of work and doesnt seem practical to support 90% of the test cases out there
03:36  Vorspire: but as for some url's that are entered into the cache, they will be hashed as a complete url string withthe queries, since they are hard-coded

04:09  eTiger13: _Bradders: huh?
04:10  KingPin-CA: eTiger13.... Now i guess I need to understand why.. I must have missed something along my reading
04:10  KingPin-CA: like seriuosly missed something
04:11  _Bradders: eTiger13: sorry
04:11  _Bradders: Just trying to work out my problem
04:11  _Bradders: I get communcation failure as per the RFC
04:11  _Bradders: But in the fiddler trace I see the 302 Location result
04:12  _Bradders: I would have expected to have been able to retrieve the value
04:13  eTiger13: KingPin-CA: do you understand how css works?
04:13  KingPin-CA: yes.. but it was selecting div vs selecting class
04:13  zjwalden: can i remove just the text from an element?
04:14  eTiger13: KingPin-CA: do you understand how to style elements with an id vs elements with a class?
04:14  zjwalden: nvm
04:14  zjwalden: i know the answer.. long day sorry
04:16  KingPin-CA: sorry.. yes. Id's are unique where a class can be applied to a broader set
04:17  TheEmpath: is there any way to turn off socket.io's verbosity?
04:17  KingPin-CA: so my MyMenu should just simply be ID or class not both
04:17  KingPin-CA: bah
04:18  KingPin-CA: i caused my own problem... FFS..
04:18  eTiger13: KingPin-CA: yes. # is for ids and . is for classes
04:18  eTiger13: jquery selects the same way css does
04:19  KingPin-CA: now that makes a terrible amount of sense..
04:19  KingPin-CA: guess i should re-visit selectors...
04:20  m4dv0y: how do i clear my inputs in a form after submission?

04:21  Dracos: m4dv0y: form.reset()
04:21  m4dv0y: can you give me an example
04:22  zjwalden: okay, how would i find an element's id, two levels up? (<div id="i_want"><div class="this"><span class="i'm clicking this..">Click me</span></div></div>
04:22  eTiger13: m4dv0y: form.reset()
04:22  Dracos: your form is an object, it has a reset method
04:22  m4dv0y: where i put that line?
04:22  m4dv0y: im a newbie
04:22  eTiger13: zjwalden: $(this).parent().parent()

04:23  zjwalden: hmm
04:23  zjwalden: what if i don't know the name of the parent's parent? :P
04:23  zjwalden: would the first example work?
04:23  eTiger13: m4dv0y: maybe learn some javascript first?
04:23  eTiger13: zjwalden: yes
04:23  zjwalden: thanks etiger, i appreciate your time
04:23  m4dv0y: mm ok
04:24  zjwalden: oh sweet, i think i finally grasp how the parents work hehe. i've been a little bit confused on it, but it's clear now

04:25  _Bradders: Ok, quick Q
04:25  eTiger13: _Bradders: quickA
04:25  _Bradders: I'm trying to retrieve the HTTP header value "Location" for a 302
04:26  snover: _Bradders: you can’t.
04:26  snover: _Bradders: 302s are automatically followed.
04:26  _Bradders: The 302 actually is in a different domain, which breaks all kinds of things (as per the rfc) and triggers the error callback
04:27  _Bradders: Sadly, I can do this with the Microsoft XMLHttp ActiveX object...
04:27  _Bradders: But I've been trying to recreate with jQuery / YUI
04:27  snover: Well the XMLHttpRequest Level 1 spec says it is not possible
04:27  _Bradders: I've also been sniffing, and see the value in the response, which is a little frustrating :)
04:28  snover: _Bradders: It is intentional
04:28  _Bradders: Yes, I saw the RFC
04:28  _Bradders: But I was really rather hoping I could get it somehow
04:28  _Bradders: :)
04:28  snover: no. you can’t.
04:28  eTiger13: you can if you talk to Vorspire apparently
04:29  snover: XMLHttpRequest Level 2 has provisions for it.
04:29  snover: But nothing implements level 2 yet as far as I am aware.
04:29  Vorspire: hmm what?
04:29  zjwalden: hey etiger, i'm not very great at jquery/javascript, but i was just curious, it actually returns an object type(which when i alert says object Object..) - I also read on jquery your method works, was curious if i might've been missing something.  Regardless, I got the desired result by doing $(this).parents().eq(1).attr("id");
04:29  zjwalden: would i do something like parents().parents().attr('id');?
04:30  eTiger13: zjwalden: new to jquery? and oop js?
04:30  zjwalden: new to JS period;)
04:30  eTiger13: zjwalden: yes
04:30  Vorspire: (eTiger13): you rang? :P
04:30  zjwalden: i started last weekend, or the weekend before, had a project for work i had to learn on the fly lol
04:30  hyperstream: Say i have 5 div's, bottom having z-index: 0, and the on top/front div is z-index: 4 (can start at 1 if this makes it any easier) I trying to figure out the method/math behind bringing any of the 5 divs to the top, and pressing everything else down, what is this referred as? i cant google any decent keywords
04:30  zjwalden: this place has been great, =)
04:30  eTiger13: zjwalden: might want to read the getting started tutorials and a bit on object oriented programming, specifically in javascript
04:31  eTiger13: Vorspire: _Bradders has a question for you
04:31  aaroninfidel: if I have a element that has child elements how can I trap an event when the parent element has been clicked, as well as the children?
04:31  zjwalden: i actually use oo with php, which makes adjusting to JS not too difficult
04:31  Vorspire: (_Bradders): fire away
04:31  zjwalden: just get confused with certain things, is all ;)
04:31  zjwalden: i say use, that's incorrect verbiage, but you get the point
04:31  eTiger13: hyperstream: umm modifying the zindex is what it is called. its like a stack

04:34  aaroninfidel: eTiger13: or are you busy?
04:35  _Bradders: Vorspire: Hi!
04:35  Vorspire: hi :)
04:35  _Bradders: Vorspire: Was just reading the spec
04:35  Shawn_: hello all
04:35  Vorspire: i hear you want to retrieve an http header from cross-domain with ajax?
04:35  _Bradders: Trying to get the value of Location from an HTTP Header for a failed ajax query (302)
04:36  serio_: word up
04:36  Vorspire: _Bradders, how fluent are you with PHP?
04:36  _Bradders: I get network error (per the spec)
04:36  _Bradders: I get by :)
04:36  Vorspire: kow anything about cURL?
04:36  _Bradders: Annoyingly, I can do it using IE
04:36  _Bradders: Yup
04:36  _Bradders: I can drive cURL
04:36  _Bradders: Ok, I see where your heading
04:37  hmd: _Bradders, "you are heading"
04:37  Vorspire: ok, make a local PHP file that accepts a URL argument and use ajax to request it :P
04:37  _Bradders: Its frustrating, seeing it in the fiddler trace :)
04:37  Vorspire: ^^
04:37  _Bradders: you're
04:37  Vorspire: use cURL to get your info andreturn it using json_encode in php
04:37  _Bradders: Sorry
04:38  Vorspire: there is a wy to secure it, because at it's minimum it's pretty unsafe tbf
04:38  Vorspire: as eTiger13 stated
04:38  _Bradders: Not too concerned about security for this one, it could almost be hosted somewhere
04:39  Vorspire: that's fine :)
04:39  Vorspire: all you'dhave to do is hard-code the url in the php file and match it to the request from the ajax
04:39  _Bradders: Thanks for confirming, would have been chasing my tail for a long time!
04:39  Vorspire: hehe np
04:39  _Bradders: I might just do all the work in PHP and return the actual value :)
04:40  Vorspire: well as eTiger13 stated, you can use firebug to insert any url you want to load with that cURL request, but Isee what you mean, you can expect only certain headers, so it's cool
04:41  Vorspire: if your web service supports fsockopen (not firewalled) then that will be easier maybe :P
04:42  serio_: what is this #PHP?
04:42  serio_: take that server side shit elsewhere :)
04:42  serio_: psh

05:43  ocf: using the jquery contextmenu plugin. It's a right-click menu creator that uses a UL. If 3 of my LI's (each with an ID) has a class, how do I pass that 3-item array through to a PHP/CodeIgniter function?
05:44  ocf: I used $('li').each & array.push($(this).text()) to create a 3-item array, but I don't know how to serialize that & pass it to my function (nor do I know if thats the best way)
05:44  Carneque: what data do you want in the array?
05:44  ocf: simply the li.text
05:44  Carneque: hmm
05:45  ocf: I thought about using .getJSON and dynamically building my site URL, but I don't know how many LI's are going to be selected, and I don't want a codeigniter function with x variables
05:45  ocf: so I thought it'd be great to serialize as one variable, pass via getJSON site, unserialize on the backend, and return json
05:46  Carneque: Have you thought about using a javascript for each conditional statement that pushes each member of the javascript li into the php array?
05:46  ocf: already done that
05:46  ocf: the 3 items that are selected all have a class named checkmark
05:46  Carneque: but it may be more or less than three items?
05:47  ocf: so I have $('#myMenu li.checkmark').each() and inside the function I use array.push($(this).text());
05:47  ocf: yeah, its however many li's have the 'checkmark' class (which, believe it or not, adds a checkmark to the item =)
05:48  Carneque: So you've already been successful in coverting a javascript array to a php array?
05:48  ocf: oh I misread that
05:48  Carneque: I had luck with that before, it does work
05:49  ocf: currently all I have is... at the end of my js function, if I alert my array, i get 'item1, item2, item3'
05:49  ocf: i'm not sure how that'd work. I thought to just serialize my array, but jQuery doesn't seem to allow you to serialize anything but a form ...
05:51  Carneque: what is serialization I don't even know
05:53  Carneque: Google this "convert javascript array to php array"
05:53  parndt: I have a jQuery UI sortable but sometimes when I drag the browser decides to highlight instead
05:54  parndt: any way to stop that?
05:54  Carneque: I know tht worked for me
05:54  ocf: it converts an object into a series of bits
05:54  ocf: can I do that from within a callback function?
05:55  parndt: only in webkit
05:55  Carneque: I think you'd have to create a variable equal to the JQuery statement, within a for each conditional, then push it to the php array
05:55  parndt: why don't you use json on both sides
05:55  Carneque: I don't know any json btw
05:58  ocf: parndt - i've only ever used .getJSON, i'll look into it
05:58  ocf: is there a .toJSON?
05:59  Carneque: Gotta go , sorry!

06:41  Kerrick: I'm working on a project that already uses jQuery, and I need to add my own jQuery code. It would be most convenient if I could supply my own callback to the $() function in addition to the one already supplied by the existing project, so that my callback would execute immediately after that of the existing project. How can I do this?
06:41  TheIronSky: !!!!!!!!!
06:42  TheIronSky: How does the jQuery look on this page?
06:42  TheIronSky: http://www.r9films.com/
06:42  TheIronSky: Also, I was wondering if its more efficient to use separate stylesheets for every page or not...
06:42  coldhead: very nice
06:43  coldhead: i like the copyright warning
06:43  coldhead: and the threat of having a protection agency beat me up
06:43  TheIronSky: lol
06:44  TheIronSky: im anti-ACTA as you well know
06:44  TheIronSky: so go ahead and steal that code
06:44  TheIronSky: i could care less
06:44  TheIronSky: (just dont tell me about it)
06:45  TheIronSky: and i didnt buy the protection service
06:45  TheIronSky: i lied
06:45  coldhead: so you're also pro-lying?
06:45 * coldhead takes notes
06:45  coldhead: i would roll my stylesheets together
06:46  coldhead: for my own sanity
06:46  hobs: he's pro-deceit, not so much pro lying
06:46  Kerrick: How do I handle cases where multiple scripts call $(callback)?
06:47  TheIronSky: coldhead: so... it wont really affect load times if i use one giant stylesheet?
06:47  coldhead: it won't be THAT giant
06:48  coldhead: and people only have to load it once
06:48  TheIronSky: :O
06:48  TheIronSky: thats what i thought
06:48  TheIronSky: its... semi-large
06:48  coldhead: my site-wide stylesheets are still smaller than most of my images
06:48  TheIronSky: well
06:48  coldhead: and you don't see me offering to snail mail you the images to save your bandwidth
06:49  TheIronSky: text <images
06:49  vector_xyz: !seen jresig
06:49  coldhead: although come to think of it...
06:49  TheIronSky: and I use png's, so my images can get large
06:49  nimbupani: you can send those images to your local police station coldhead
06:49  hobs: haha TheIronSky said he was anti-acta but he wasnt kidding
06:49  TheIronSky: lolno
06:49  hobs: http://www.r9films.com/ironsky_sm.png
06:49  TheIronSky: not a joke
06:49  hobs: more of an understatement
06:50  TheIronSky: lol, even better: http://www.r9films.com/ironsky_complete.png
06:50  TheIronSky: and thats the LOW-res version
06:50  TheIronSky: the other one is rendered at 725DPI
06:50  hobs: why are you makin enormous resolutions
06:50  TheIronSky: because i want a billboard
06:50  hobs: oh
06:51  TheIronSky: hobs, did you read the article?
06:52  hobs: not much completely mainly because I already know acta is just shit
06:52  TheIronSky: :P
06:52  hobs: let me go finish it
06:52  TheIronSky: its very angry
06:53  TheIronSky: possibly too angry for my own sake
06:53 --- siculars_ is now known as siculars
06:53  hobs: well anger can be a useful emotion if it is channeled correctly
06:53  Hiero: heydudes.  I have an image I'm gonna try shimming up inside its wrapper, because it's not sticking to one margin or another. Think it'll work?
06:53 --- Hiero is now known as Hierofant
06:53  TheIronSky: no
06:54  Hierofant: srsly?
06:54  TheIronSky: i dont think that shimming anything will work
06:54  Brodingo: sup y'all
06:54  Hierofant: has to always be a wrapper?
06:54  Hierofant: is never a sibling?
06:54  Hierofant: [spacer]move this to the right
06:55  TheIronSky: Hierofant, i dont know what you're talking about.. do you mean Shimmying?
06:55  TheIronSky: like.. with .css() or something?
06:55  devinrolsen: ajpiano, I think we solved that issue man, I don't have the article in front of me now but had to do with a weird 1.4.1 bug that required a tweak in the lib. I think the client has been more than persuaded to upgrade to the 1.4.3 now :)
06:56  Hierofant: <div id="container">    <div>this div is 200px and pushes the image after it over by 200px in the layout</div><img src="moveme.jpg">     </div>    <--- like this.  YES?
06:56  ajpiano: omg you were on 1.4.1?!?!
06:56  ajpiano: 1.4.1 was busted had some ajax bugs in it
06:56  ajpiano: WHOPS
06:56  coldhead: classic 1.4
06:56  devinrolsen: naw naw it was my bad too
06:56  danheberden: i run 1.2.6 - its like a classic car
06:56  devinrolsen: they stripped the verison form the compressed I had and renamed it to simply jquery.js
06:56  devinrolsen: lol
06:56  devinrolsen: so I had no idea as well
06:56  danheberden: i got it all pimped out with original 1.2.6 plugins
06:57  TheIronSky: Hierofant: can't you just use a <br/> tag instead?
06:57  Hierofant: no its gotta be calculated to the pixel
06:57  devinrolsen: anyways, I feel much better knowing I am not insane hehe
06:57  Hierofant: and its not responding to CSS
06:57  TheIronSky: yeah, just style the tag
06:57  Hierofant: ok so how do I insert a sibling in jquery?
06:58  TheIronSky: you should check out #css, but do you mind if I PM you?
06:58  Hierofant: .insertAfter() isn't what I'm looking for
06:58  devinrolsen: JohnResig rocks!
06:58  devinrolsen: has to say it while he was here
06:58  Hierofant: haha
06:58 @JohnResig: devinrolsen: hehe, thanks
06:58  Hierofant: JohnResig rocks yes he does
06:58  Hierofant: HE SPEAKS!
06:58  devinrolsen: omg you responed, kudos to all your hard work for us all man
06:59  Hierofant: yeah seriously
06:59  TheIronSky: JohnResig: hey, sorry about the last time you were on here
06:59  TheIronSky: i didnt know who you were..
06:59  TheIronSky: and now...
06:59 @JohnResig: hehe, it's ok
06:59  TheIronSky: 0_o
06:59  Hierofant: jquery both shortens all our paths to produce *and* got me to try javascript again
06:59  parndt: jQuery drives me crazy sometimes
06:59  parndt: (for balance)
06:59  TheIronSky: why did you lose faith in javascript?
07:00  ajpiano: JohnResig: i just tooled around with jquery mobile for the first time
07:00 @JohnResig: ajpiano: oh?
07:00  parndt: of course it solves more problems than any other framework, so.. yeah
07:00  Hierofant: I tried learning it in 1997.
07:00  ajpiano: yeah, it's kind of groovy
07:00  ajpiano: :D
07:00 @JohnResig: cool! :)
07:00 @JohnResig: I'm working on perf right now
07:00  parndt: Hierofant: surely it was easier back then without all these crazy browsers
07:00  Brodingo: this is how i feel about jquery vs javascript
07:00 @JohnResig: I think I broke buttons before coming home, heh
07:00  Brodingo: ?g internet research paper
07:00  bot-t: Brodingo, Research Paper Internet Library. - http://www.businessbookmall.com/Research Paper Internet Library.htm
07:00  Hierofant: lol parndt
07:01  parndt: still can't find a reliable cross browser wysiwyg ;p
07:01  Brodingo: research paper = javascript, inernet= jquery!
07:01  ajpiano: i was unclear as to why something happened which is... are all pages equal?
07:01  TheIronSky: parndt: they dont exist
07:01  Brodingo: WHAT
07:01  digitalfiz: say i have a linked list with a sub linked list and i want to add a class to the main <li> if a sub <li> in the sub list has a certain class how can i do this?
07:01 @JohnResig: ajpiano: hmm? not sure I follow
07:01  Brodingo: http://boingboing.net/images/1ff127c9mv3.png
07:01  ajpiano: hmm, maybe i should put it online
07:02  TheIronSky: the internet = magic
07:02  Kerrick: How do I handle cases where multiple scripts call $(callback)?
07:03  parndt: digitalfiz: $('li.with_my_class').parents('li').last().addClass('my_other_class_i_want_to_add')
07:03  parndt: no guarantees that's the best way
07:03  Cork: Kerrick: what do you mean you need to handle?
07:03  digitalfiz: nice lemmie try that
07:03  digitalfiz: thanks parndt
07:04  devinrolsen: JohnResig: Just went to my first meet up last week out here in Portland Oregon! Went great and lots of collaboration and ideas were flying!
07:04  Kerrick: Cork, I have some code that someone else wrote that calls $(callback), which it would be inconvenient to modify. I would like to also call $(callback) from my code, but when I do so, it seems to ignore my callback entirely.
07:04  devinrolsen: was really kinda surprised at the amount of turn on tbh
07:04  devinrolsen: out*
07:04  Cork: Kerrick: you mean the $(function() {}); call?
07:05 @JohnResig: devinrolsen: nice!
07:05  Kerrick: Cork, yes.
07:05  Cork: Kerrick: you would have to pb your code, cause that shouldn't happen
07:05  Cork: ?p @ Kerrick
07:05  bot-t: Kerrick, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
07:05  Cork: or a public link of you have one
07:06  TheIronSky: i wonder if hobs's head exploded whilst reading that article...
07:06  hobs: which one
07:06  hobs: oh yours
07:06  Brodingo: im impressed by the quality of javascript and drupal meet ups in austin, very good stuff 'round here y'all
07:06  hobs: no I read it but then I was in a class sorry
07:06  TheIronSky: guess not
07:06  hobs: I then read the wikipedia acta article
07:06  hobs: then policy laundering
07:07  hobs: wikipedia is great
07:07  parndt: pity about the moderators
07:07  hobs: yeah I try not to think about that
07:07  parndt: our article is still deleted
07:07  parndt: oh well
07:07  hobs: which article is our article
07:07  TheIronSky: i was hoping you'd get past paragraph 3 and just sit in your chair... nnnnnnhhhhhgggggg-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
07:07  parndt: oh our CMS, but it's not notable in the way they want it to be
07:07  hobs: oh I see
07:08  parndt: which is newspaper articles
07:08  TheIronSky: like that scene from scanners
07:08  hobs: yeah TheIronSky I remember when people were saying similar things about NAFTA and the amero
07:08  hobs: ive heard a lot of things
07:08  hobs: it all comes down to politicians are terrible people
07:08  TheIronSky: the amero
07:08  TheIronSky: lol
07:08  TheIronSky: you should take your passport
07:09  hobs: yep there was a lot of crazy rants about that
07:09  TheIronSky: and smash it with a hammer
07:09  Hierofant: To insert some html as a sibling, would I do var addl = "<div id='pushup'>";  (theParent).add(addl) ?
07:09  hobs: its paper
07:09  ajpiano: JohnResig: http://ajpiano.com/jqm/index.htm
07:09  TheIronSky: srs, smash your passport to destroy the RFTH Chip
07:10  ajpiano: nm
07:10  hobs: I have a really old passport
07:10  ajpiano: i figured the whole thing out
07:10  Hierofant: I converted mine to a RTFM chip
07:10  hobs: I have a rtfm shirt but that's it
07:10  TheIronSky: http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b282/sordidfiction/scanners4.gif
07:10  Hierofant: Rage Ta'get Fanservice Machines
07:11  Hierofant: yeah, but slower.
07:12  Hierofant: ajpiano - I got an error
07:12  Hierofant: perhaps intentional... the foo error
07:13  ajpiano: it gets all weird after a while
07:13  ajpiano: tbh
07:13  Hierofant: I guess you know what I refer
07:13  Hierofant: orange box
07:14  Hierofant: so what'
07:14  Hierofant: whats the appropriate way to add a sibling after something?
07:15  Hierofant: if the sibling happens to be HTML code :)
07:15  Brodingo: .after() perhaps
07:16  Hierofant: add(var).after($('div.targetSibling')  ?
07:16  Hierofant: )
07:17  Brodingo: um $('div.targetSib').after(var)
07:17  Hierofant: thanks Brodingo
07:18  Kerrick: Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/GfKyS/
07:18  Kerrick: It won't work on the jsfiddle site properly, but you can see the problem; it's explained in the javascript comment
07:20  Cork: Kerrick: have you tried to remove the //<![CDATA[ part?
07:20  Cork: + //]]>
07:20  Vorspire: :E
07:20  Vorspire: hey Cork
07:21  Cork: ello Vorspire
07:21  Kerrick: Cork, it should make no difference; it's commented
07:21  Kerrick: Cork, I deleted that part and it made no difference.
07:22  Cork: Kerrick: you would have to pb the generated part
07:22  Brodingo: kerrick so why dont you just use jquery?
07:22  Cork: php code isn't exactly telling what happens :)
07:22  Cork: Brodingo: he does
07:22  Brodingo: no i mean instead of the dollar sign
07:23  serio_: Did the handle option get dropped from UI Slider?
07:23  Cork: hmm
07:23  Cork: Kerrick: your using any other framework then jquery?
07:23  Cork: like prototype or mootools or so on?
07:24  serio_: looks like you can't specify handle anymore, it just builds it on it's own...
07:24  Kerrick: Cork, no. I also checked to make sure that my Javascript executes, which it does.
07:25  Cork: Kerrick: a console.log($.version) on the line before $(function() {
07:25  Cork: what does it show?
07:26 --- frigginAsleep is now known as seutje
07:26  Kerrick: The jQuery version is 1.4.2, but I'll run that code too.
07:26  Cork: sorry wrong object...
07:28  Kerrick: Cork, Firebug pops up with an error saying "$ is undefined". I'll try using jQuery.ready() instead.
07:28  Kerrick: err
07:28  Kerrick: jQuery(document).ready()
07:28  Brodingo: woah good idea
07:29  Kerrick: Yay it works
07:29  Kerrick: Thanks Cork
07:29  Brodingo: ...
07:29  Vorspire: kerrick, what about wrapping the code with (function($){ ... })(jQuery); //I know you've fixedit but still, for future :P
07:30  Cork: ya, that will work
07:30  Cork: something is replacing the $ variable
07:30  Cork: or you can do jquery(function($) { });
07:30  Vorspire: not sure if noConflict can help too, because i've never needed it or used it
07:30  Hierofant: crap, I don't think shimming will work
07:30  Kerrick: I'm guessing the other code undefines $ in order to prevent potential conflicts or something.
07:30  Cork: you can reclame the variable
07:31  Cork: but it will most likly break the other script
07:31  ejo: shimming... are you leveling some furniture?
07:31  seancurtis: Is it beer o'clock? Why yes. Yes it is.
07:31  ejo: why, i thought it was beer:thirty
07:32 * Vorspire hands over a fresh Beck's __} to seancurtis ...mmmm...
07:32  Kerrick: Vorspire's method is a good idea, I'll use it.
07:33  Vorspire: I'm going to reassign my jQuery from $ to £ just because I'm English :P
07:33  Cork: Kerrick: wrapping everything in (function($){ ... })(jQuery); gives the same effect as doing jquery(function($) { });
07:33  Cork: except you need another scope
07:34  Kerrick: Cork, what do you mean by "except you need another scope"?
07:35  Superman_: document.getElementById('form1').target = 'upload_target';
07:35  Superman_: is equal to
07:35  Superman_: $("form1").target = 'upload_target';
07:35  Superman_: ??
07:35  Cork: Kerrick: (function($) { $(function() {}); })(jQuery) === jquery(function($) { });
07:35  Vorspire: (Superman_): $('#form1').attr('target', 'upload_target');
07:36  Superman_: its actually an iframe
07:36  Superman_: <iframe id="upload_target" name="upload_target" src="" style="width:0;height:0;border:0px solid #fff;"></iframe>
07:36  Kerrick: Also, now I'm having the problem that the box is briefly flashing in its original form (without the rounded corners created by the jQuery script). How do I suppress rendering of the box until the jQuery has been applied to it?
07:37  Vorspire: (Superman_): nothing changes from what I said :)
07:37 * seancurtis hands Vorspire back his Beck and grabs a James Squire instead :)
07:37  seancurtis: Vorspire: lol @ using £
07:37  Superman_: thanks vorspire
07:37 * Vorspire hands over a fresh bottle of Jack Daniel's __ to seancurtis ...mmmm...
07:37  Cork: Kerrick: the $(function(){}); or .ready (samething) is meant to trigger early enogh to get before the rendering
07:38  coldhead: aw james squire
07:38  coldhead: how patriotic
07:38  Vorspire: xD
07:39  Kerrick: Cork, hmm, that's odd, then. I guess it's a rather minor issue.
07:39  seancurtis: Vorspire: http://twitter.com/#!/seancurtis/status/28377491864
07:40  Vorspire: rofl xD
07:40 --- yuwang_ is now known as yuwang
07:43  Superman_: without using any plugin I want to know how can i upload an image with jquery?? any ideas or links to tutorial
07:44  Vorspire: post the file data to a local PHP file to handle the uploading, Superman_
07:44  Jarda: Vorspire: but you can't upload files with ajax without doing some hacking
07:44  Vorspire: at least I think you can initiate it like that
07:44  Jarda: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
07:44  Jarda: I would use something like that
07:45  Jarda: if using a plugin is impossible, then I would take the code from there..
07:45  Superman_: this stuff which i already done. But as we do with simple text input. Not working with file type
07:45  Jarda: Superman_: yep, you can't upload files with ajax
07:45  Hierofant: This line causes endless errors;  what's the problem?   $('div.ad-image').add('<div id="pushup"></div>');
07:46  Vorspire: is $.fn.add a function in jQuery?
07:46  Vorspire: ?add
07:46  bot-t: .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
07:46  Jarda: Vorspire: it is
07:46  Vorspire: too basic for my liking xD
07:47  Vorspire: (Hierofant): $('div.ad-image').add($('<div id="pushup"></div>'));
07:47  Hierofant: well there's also insertAfter()  but that seemed to only work once you had the code
07:47  Hierofant: Vorspire oh, ok thx
07:47  Jarda: Vorspire: his code also should work, so the problem is elsewhere
07:47  TheIronSky: sLFgsd
07:47  TheIronSky: ghsdg
07:48  Jarda: Hierofant: but you know it doesn't add the contents to the page, right?
07:48  Jarda: it just adds the code to the resultset of your selector
07:48  Vorspire: (Jarda): apparently the docs say it takes a selector, which translates into a jQuery object, does .add take a direct string argument?
07:48  Jarda: .add( html )
07:48  Jarda: htmlAn HTML fragment to add to the set of matched elements.
07:48  coldhead: As of 2006, 59% of developers for the .NET platform used Visual Basic .NET as their only language.
07:48  Vorspire: hmm
07:48  TheIronSky: really?
07:49  Vorspire: I hate VB andI'm a .net dev >>
07:49  TheIronSky: as in, they only knew vb?
07:49  Hierofant: oh.,  well Jarda, I'd like to add it to the DOM and the page and the display
07:49  Jarda: Hierofant: then use append
07:49  Hierofant: gr8 thanks
07:49  coldhead: apparently so, TheIronSky
07:49  Vorspire: VB is deprecated :/
07:49  Hierofant: jarda can I specify a target sibling or parent?
07:49  TheIronSky: coldhead: that's ridiculous
07:49  Hierofant: Vorspire - still used for plugin detection!
07:50  TheIronSky: I know upwards of 8-9 languages
07:50  TheIronSky: and I use them all often
07:50  coldhead: upwards
07:50  TheIronSky: yeah
07:50  Vorspire: html, css, xml don't count :P
07:50  coldhead: cool
07:50  TheIronSky: dont feel like countinf
07:50  TheIronSky: ok
07:50  TheIronSky: well.. then.. does jquery count as seperate?
07:50  coldhead: no
07:50  Jarda: Hierofant: $('div.foo').append('<p>Foo</p>'); results to <div class="foo"><p>Foo</p></div>
07:50  TheIronSky: so then upwards of 5-6
07:51  Jarda: Vorspire: why don't you count xml as an programming language?
07:51  Vorspire: cgi and json dn't count either xD
07:51  TheIronSky: dont use those
07:51  Vorspire: it's a script language
07:51  Jarda: I mean, if you count php as a programming language, then xml is also
07:51  Jarda: or perl
07:52  Vorspire: XML isn't a programming language, its a data storage system
07:52  Vorspire: and a slow one at that
07:52  Jarda: you are wrong
07:52  Dracos: xml is markup, not code
07:52  Jarda: http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_for_each.asp
07:53  Jarda: that is valid xml..
07:53  TheIronSky: Ruby on Rails, Python, C & C++, Objective C, Java, JavaScript, and I occasionally use Visual Basic
07:53  Vorspire: (Jarda): it's still not programming language, that markup tell the server to run a for loop in C
07:53  Dracos: vb is barely code
07:53  coldhead: ruby and python are the same language
07:54  TheIronSky: Dracos, I am aware
07:54  Dracos: lol, no
07:54  coldhead: c, c++ and obj are the same too
07:54  Dracos: n o again
07:54  coldhead: obj-c*
07:54  Jarda: Vorspire: oh, where does it run the loop in C?
07:54  Rotham: ruby and python have some similarities but they are hardly the same
07:54  mekwall: good morning peeps
07:54  TheIronSky: Ruby on rails is a framework
07:55  coldhead: print "Hello world" works the same on python and ruby
07:55  Rotham: ruby isnt rails
07:55  Rotham: lol
07:55  coldhead: so they're the same language
07:55  Vorspire: (Jarda): It's obviously parsed by the browser and compiled into the native code that the browser uses to parse markup
07:55  Vorspire: which would probebly be C
07:55  Superman_: #ajax
07:55  TheIronSky: coldhead: and i combined C and C++
07:55  Dracos: then php and fortran are the same language too
07:55  TheIronSky: but the 2 forms of objective C that I know
07:55  Jarda: Vorspire: php is also parsed with a compiler written in C/C++, is php not a programming language?
07:55  coldhead: and void main () {printf("Hello world");} runs the same on c, c++ and obj-c
07:55  TheIronSky: are very, very different
07:55  coldhead: so they're the same
07:55 --- seutje is now known as frigginWork
07:55  coldhead: php and perl are the same
07:56  coldhead: just different dialects
07:56  Jarda: actually, javascript is parsed and run in browser also, isn't javascript a programming language?
07:56  Dracos: just because languages share one command doesn't make them identical
07:56  Rotham: coldhead: that works in D as well
07:56  coldhead: javascript is just a dialect of java
07:56  TheIronSky: kinda
07:56  TheIronSky: but not really
07:56  coldhead: you need java in your browser for javascript to work
07:56  Rotham: lol
07:56  mekwall: coldhead, python is the same language as ruby?
07:56  Jarda: coldhead: wrong. No need for java :)
07:57  Rotham: uhh lol
07:57  coldhead: exactly the same, mekwall
07:57  TheIronSky: yes, but javascript is formatted and written much differently
07:57  Jarda: but I know coldhead is just trolling
07:57  mekwall: coldhead, say that to a pythonista :)
07:57  coldhead: any python program will run in ruby
07:57  coldhead: and vice versa
07:57  mekwall: that's like saying that american english is british
07:57  TheIronSky: Java is more like Basic than anything else
07:57  coldhead: they'[re just different compielers
07:57  Rotham: Qbasic executes faster than C
07:58  mekwall: coldhead, doesn't matter... they are still defined as different languages
07:58  Jarda: Vorspire: so, isn't php ar javascript programming languages?
07:58  coldhead: if they were different why would they be called IRONruby and IRONpython?
07:58  coldhead: you're trolling mekwall
07:58 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
07:58  coldhead: they're the same
07:58  Jarda: actually, C isn't a programming language either
07:58  Jarda: it is compiled to bytecode
07:58  Vorspire: XML is not a language but a meta language. More
07:58  Vorspire: specifically it is a set of syntax rules but it lacks any semantics or
07:58  Vorspire: element structure. As you know, a fully qualified languages does include
07:58  Vorspire: syntax, semantics and structure. The semantics and the structure are not
07:58  Vorspire: provided by XML but by the designer of the XML based language.
07:58  Rotham: lol
07:58  TheIronSky: doesnt that make it even more of a programming language?
07:59  coldhead: ?p @ Vorspire
07:59  bot-t: Vorspire, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
07:59  Vorspire: ?botsnack
07:59  bot-t: Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
07:59  Vorspire: ?cc
07:59  bot-t: CASE CLOASED >: |
07:59  mekwall: coldhead, it's not trolling... if you learn python that doesn't mean you know ruby and vice versa, even if they are very similar
07:59  Jarda: every programming language is the same, they all instruct the CPU the same!
07:59  TheIronSky: lets settle this like real men: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages
07:59  TheIronSky: because wiki = correct
07:59  coldhead: mekwall: they're just different styles
08:00  mekwall: so you call different programming languages as styles now?
08:00  Rotham: heh
08:00  mekwall: well I guess you have a different definition then :)
08:00  Dracos: coldhead: by your logic, french, italian, and spanish are all the same language too
08:00  Vorspire: (Jarda): wrong, what about 32 and 64-bit processes, what about multi-threading and cross-thread safety? all handled very differently by ASM in different langauges
08:00  Rotham: everyone in the world speaks a different style of english :)
08:00  coldhead: they're different styles but ironpython can run all ironruby code
08:00  mekwall: woot?
08:00  mekwall: Rotham, that is so wrong haha
08:00  coldhead: because they have the same java versions machine
08:00  mekwall: Rotham, english is a germanic language :p
08:01  Rotham: lorem ipsum babysum!
08:01  Jarda: Vorspire: nah, I wasn't that serios with that comment. But XML is a programming language, if Javascript and php is, that I'm certain of.
08:01  mekwall: lorem ipsum dolor sit amet :p
08:02  Dracos: http://www.lorizzle.nl/?feed=1
08:02  Vorspire: (Jarda): would you be willing to meet me in the middle and agree it's a "pseudo programming language"? :P
08:02  TheIronSky: Well, I forgot about C#
08:02  Rotham: look.. python is english, and ruby is sort of like the english they speak in the appalachian mountains
08:02  TheIronSky: haven't used that in forever
08:02  TheIronSky: Rotham: lol, that's about right
08:02  Rotham: it isnt quite understandable until you have spent a little while examining it
08:02  Vorspire: C# is the best. Period.
08:02  Jarda: C++!
08:03  TheIronSky: Vorspire: indeed
08:03  mekwall: C# is evil :(
08:03  TheIronSky: but i do prefer object handling in C++
08:03  Jarda: actually if I could decide, I would just be coding javascript
08:03  Jarda: like the syntax
08:03  TheIronSky: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/BjarneStroustrup.jpg = Jesus
08:04  TheIronSky: c'mon, who doesnt love classes?
08:05  TheIronSky: brb
08:05  mekwall: TheIronSky, that's a true nerd... those running shoes seal the deal :P
08:05  juha_: awesome morning to y'all
08:05  Vorspire: lol
08:06  coldhead: juha_: isn't it true that python and ruby are different dialects of the same language
08:06  mekwall: I never really understood why true nerds use running shoes...
08:07  coldhead: there are really only 5 languages: java/javascript, the c family, perl/php/tcl, lisp and ruby/python
08:07  mekwall: coldhead, they derive from the same scheme
08:07  coldhead: scheme is in the lisp family
08:07  mekwall: just as all english languages derive from the germanic languages
08:07  coldhead: ?w scheme programming language
08:07  bot-t: coldhead, Scheme (programming language) - Scheme is one of the two main dialects of the programming language Lisp. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)
08:08  mekwall: that doesn't mean they are the same :/
08:08  Rotham: Why do you put java and js in the same family besides the name?
08:08  coldhead: naughty pretty angels
08:08  mekwall: I mean... I cannot apply for work as a Ruby coder if I studied Python and the other way around
08:08  Vorspire: Didn't English derive from Latin and French?
08:08  mekwall: doesn't work that way
08:08  coldhead: javascript is just a simplified version of java
08:08  mekwall: Vorspire, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages
08:08  coldhead: javascript is a way to use java with less ram
08:08  coldhead: by having fewer classes
08:09  mekwall: javascript is to use java as script :P
08:09  mekwall: I would say
08:09  coldhead: don't germanic languages derive from sanskrit?
08:09  Rotham: i dont really know java... i just never heard it compared before...
08:09  Rotham: heh most languages derive from sanskrit
08:10  Rotham: alot anyway
08:10  coldhead: anyway spoken languages are all very old, computer languages are only 15 years old
08:10  mekwall: which is old
08:10  cicovy: Hi, can someone tell me how to resolve this IE8 error? " 'undefined' is null or not an object"

11:21  pngll: blackspotwiggins: ok I looked into it, that's a bit too much work for me right now. Changes will be in effects.core, and should affects the first $.each, getColor and getRGB. Also, I couldn't find tests for effects core?
11:21  blackspotwiggins: hmm
11:21  blackspotwiggins: not sure about those things
11:21  blackspotwiggins: you could try posting on jquery forums with a patch or creating a ticket on trac
11:22  Rinthe: anyone?
11:26  pngll: blackspotwiggins: ok, thanks.
11:27  markj: Rinthe - doesnt work is quite vague, do you have a live example?
11:33  Rinthe: markj: not a live example but if you download the example from his website here: http://github.com/arnklint/jquery-contextMenu
11:36  BlackJ: hi! i have a simple menu with submenus and this jquery code http://jsfiddle.net/VVYxg/
11:36  iszak: coldhead, beer o'clock yet?
11:37  BlackJ: how can i make a menu tab active when i click on it
11:37  BlackJ: i'm adding the active class to it, but because it has hover effect in doesn't "stay active"
11:38  BlackJ: actually i have to disable hover effect for the currently clicked menu tab
11:39  BlackJ: how can i do that?
11:39  abj: does jQuery UI support both markup and programmatic declaration of widgets, just like Dojo does?
11:42  Northwoods: does jquery have anything like ltrim and rtrim
11:43  Northwoods: left trim right trim , or just trim , for whitespaces ?

11:52  abj: Does jQuery UI support both markup and programmatic declaration of widgets, just like Dojo does?
11:52  blackspotwiggins: abj, what do you mean?
11:52  blackspotwiggins: probably not just like Dojo
11:52  blackspotwiggins: because that would be dojo
11:53  Rinthe: http://pastebin.com/YyDzQ4Bk this is a plugin for right click context menu, anyone know why it doesn't work in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/YyeSq/
11:53  blackspotwiggins: Rinthe, doesnt work in chrome either
11:53  abj: like with markup I can declare widgets directly in the HTML code in the within the <body> tag. With programmatic method I can also create them directly on-the-fly in a piece of Javascript code somewhere (usually in the header)
11:54  blackspotwiggins: abj, you mean like $("#something").datepicker() vs something having class "become-datepicker"?
11:56  abj: blackspotwiggins, not sure exactly what's the diff between those two, but if I don't have any element with an ID prepared in the HTML body can I then create the element directly from with javascript, that is, both create the element and make it a jquery ui widget?
11:56  blackspotwiggins: yes
11:56  blackspotwiggins: obviously
11:57  abj: yeah, now that I formulated it I see that :) So what about the other way around, creating the widget without using any javascript within the header?!
11:58  abj: (due to source code management)
11:58  blackspotwiggins: you cant create widgets without using js
11:58  abj: ok, but is it safe to put that js in the within the body?
11:58  blackspotwiggins: of course
11:58  blackspotwiggins: you can and should also use ready callback on document
11:59  abj: right
11:59  abj: ok, well then I think I have achieved my goal....
12:00  abj: I guess it's also possible to dynamically load UI libraries and not having to declare them statically like http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/default.html does?

12:18  hrwath: ruby_on_tails, yeah, and you become a vampire
12:18  ruby_on_tails: abj: because after death I won't be able to drink it
12:18  abj: drink what?

13:17  poppiez: does anyone know how to install multiple version of IE (preferrably IE6,7,8) on windows xp? (figure most of you do cross-browser tests)
13:17  mekwall: haha cool
13:17  AsgarothBelem: You dont install, install IETester instead
13:17  markj: poppiez i personally just use http://www.spoon.net/browsers
13:18  markj: or use IETester
13:18  juha_: whoa it's snowing in helsinki
13:18  mekwall: oodavid, HTC Desire HD then ;)
13:18  oodavid: poppiez: I've started putting the "chrome frame" meta tag on my sites
13:18  oodavid: that way I can call the "I'm only human" card :-)
13:18  mekwall: oodavid, but Samsung Galaxy S is still my fav.
13:19  oodavid: mekwall: yeah, I'm a bit strapped for cash, but I'd take the Desire Z
13:19  oodavid: love a hardware KB :D
13:19  poppiez: markj: sweet! nice tools. thank you
13:19  mekwall: oodavid, ah ok... you've ever tried swype though?
13:19  poppiez: oodavid: required a plugin tho ;)
13:20  poppiez: requires*
13:20  mekwall: poppiez, best way to test multiple IEs is to run a clean install of win xp on a VM
13:20  mekwall: the install multiple IE and stand-alone 7
13:20  mekwall: poppiez, http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE
13:21  oodavid: mekwall: was just looking at that yesterday, seems pretty smart
13:21  poppiez: mekwall: thank you. good tip
13:21  mekwall: poppiez, that's what I do :) I have three VMs for testing purposes... Mac OS X, Win XP and Ubuntu
13:21  hrwath: there is Internet Explorer Collection as well
13:21  hrwath: form 1.0 to 9.0 afair ;-)
13:21  AsgarothBelem: yeah microsoft gives this VM for free actually
13:21  hrwath: from*
13:21  oodavid: poppiez: if it's not for "hands-on" testing (ie, rendering only) then you can try browsershots.org too
13:21  AsgarothBelem: these*
13:22  mekwall: hrwath, yeah... that one is better
13:22  mekwall: http://finalbuilds.edskes.net/iecollection.htm
13:22  mekwall: well... it contains Multiple IE literally
13:22  mekwall: and the standalone
13:22  oodavid: ahh, the joys of IE testing
13:22  AsgarothBelem: lol
13:22  mekwall: It's also still maintained
13:22  oodavid: aka: how to double your workload for no reason
13:23  poppiez: oodavid: I mostly use browsershots for CSS tho since it's not very interactive
13:23  mekwall: oodavid, hard to solve bugs if you can't replicate them ;)
13:23  AsgarothBelem: I love IE6, its what I use for browsing, is something wrong with that?
13:23  mekwall: just seeing a screenshot of them isn't nearly enough
13:23  poppiez: mekwall: what virtual machine do you use? I was thinking of going with parallels for mac
13:23  Ely^: Hi, I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/QHUWW/3/, when I hover the red links it does a clone and append from divs that are hidden. But the title (blank space above the small letters) does not show up because of the cufon, I can't find where to place the cufon refresh or reload, nothing works .. somebody an idea? .. sorry for the repeat :)
13:23  oodavid: mekwall: as I said, for rendertesting :D
13:23  mekwall: AsgarothBelem, I hope you are joking ;)
13:23  oodavid: if he's not I think he should be kicked
13:24  mekwall: poppiez, If you're a mac user, parallels is good... otherwise it's VMWare... which should work just fine on mac as well
13:24  AsgarothBelem: seriously guys, whats wrong with using the safest browser in the world?
13:25  nlogax: it's the cowards way!
13:25  AsgarothBelem: save IE6! http://www.saveie6.com/
13:25  AsgarothBelem: hahahahah
13:25  AsgarothBelem: seriosly something is worng with the world, who would create a site for that?
13:26  markj: i use virtualbox on my mac personally, works well for me
13:26  oodavid: yeah, VM's are pretty safe
13:26  mekwall: "You have been mislead by a vocal minority and are using chrome, which is clearly an inferior web browser to IE6."
13:26  mekwall: lol
13:27  mekwall: "The SaveIE6 campaign was launched on April 1, 2009 and will last until April 1, 2010."
13:27  mekwall: awesome
13:27  AsgarothBelem: So I cant save IE6 anymore? :(
13:28  mekwall: nope, the campaign is over :p
13:28  AsgarothBelem: should i start crying now? or later?
13:28  mekwall: "More screen space thanks to no tabs"
13:28  mekwall: haha
13:29  oodavid: "Compatible with IT departments that fear changes" - aiii, so true :(
13:29  mekwall: http://www.saveie6.com/_img/img_chart_renderspeed.jpg :D
13:29  blackspotwiggins: i like how ie is almost as retarded as ie7
13:29  blackspotwiggins: ie6* is
13:30  mekwall: ie6 is a cripple
13:30  mekwall: ie7 is a retard
13:30  mekwall: ie8 is trying to be both, but eventually just end up being a bad actor
13:31  blackspotwiggins: ie8 is ok
13:31  blackspotwiggins: but nothing special
13:31  oodavid: I think we're experiencing the nerd equivalent of "housewives having lunch"
13:31  blackspotwiggins: but once you get to know it you see the small flaws
13:31  blackspotwiggins: like it has no fingers or something
13:31  oodavid: bahahaaa
13:31  oodavid: chromeframe ftw
13:31  blackspotwiggins: but at least it's not giving everybody aids or drooling in the corner
13:32  mekwall: ie9 will be drooling in the corner
13:32  markj: chrome frame is good and all, but whats the likelihood of someone using ie6 actually having it installed?
13:32  mekwall: like the zombie it is
13:33  mekwall: markj, force them!
13:33  markj: wish i had that luxury :]
13:33  blackspotwiggins: neh
13:33  blackspotwiggins: i just leave my just as they are and leave a small note about how the user is slowly killing babies and stealing candy
13:34  blackspotwiggins: by using ie
13:35  oodavid: markj: I have an IE conditional on most my sites urging an upgrade, or at least to install chrome-frame
13:35  mekwall: same
13:35  oodavid: that way I really don't have to think about it
13:36  oodavid: all these years of battling it and I can't see the point in bothering anymore
13:36  oodavid: clients should get that in the project outline
13:36  halish: lo
13:36  mekwall: This is the new highway. You can still drive on your old road, but it's not maintained anymore.
13:36  oodavid: here here
13:36  markj: i completely agree but my issue is people that cant upgrade :/
13:36  halish: guys, i found a bug in jquery 1.4.3 (from google api)
13:37  mekwall: http://www.geekologie.com/2010/08/06/vintage-ad-3.jpg
13:37  halish: it appears on webkit browsers
13:37  mekwall: http://www.geekologie.com/2010/08/06/vintage-ad-2.jpg
13:37  mekwall: halish, show
13:37  halish: hold on a sec
13:45 --- Serpiente_ is now known as Serpiente
13:46  halish: pretty lame, but it shows where's the problem
13:46  halish: http://pastebin.com/tktkGux0
13:46  halish: here's the code
13:46  halish: the problem is with the animation of the opacity
13:47  halish: when the starting point is not 0 || 1
13:47  halish: i found the problem, i probably have the solution
13:47  halish: just need to put in the jquery and post it
13:48  halish: i need to know now, what's the path with posting the patches
13:48  mekwall: halish, works just great here
13:48  halish: mekwall: browser?
13:48  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/rydQ2/
13:48  mekwall: chrome
13:48  mekwall: so it's webkit
13:48  halish: country?
13:48  mekwall: sweden
13:48  mekwall: why?
13:48  halish: what's the decimal point in sweden?
13:48  mekwall: , :)
13:48  halish: i'm from poland
13:49  mekwall: cześć
13:49  halish: and it turns out, that $.css("opacity") returns in country's format
13:49  halish: cześć:)
13:49  mekwall: that's like one of the few phrases of polish I know hehe
13:49  halish: so the parseFloat($.css("opacity")) returns
13:50  mekwall: the rest of my polish vocabulary is words that are best not used ;)
13:50  halish: that's quite interesting in poles meeting a foreigner
13:50  halish: they all teach him or her how to swear in polish;)
13:51  patryk: kurva?! :p
13:51  mekwall: haha
13:51  halish: sort of:)
13:52  mekwall: dupek, idiota, kurwa, cipa
13:52  mekwall: :p
13:52  mekwall: I know those... and how to say hello
13:52  mekwall: I can append hello to all of them
13:52  mekwall: prepend*
13:52  patryk: lol
13:52  mekwall: cześć idiota
13:53  mekwall: one for every occasion I guess
13:53  halish: mekwall: coming back to the issue i'm talking about:)
13:53  mekwall: halish, yeah sorry
13:53  halish: no problem:)
13:54  mekwall: returns with point decimal here
13:54  mekwall: and I use swedish as regional settings for currency etc.
13:54  halish: what's the chrome's version?
13:54  mekwall: but english as language
13:54  mekwall: 8.0.552.11 dev :p
13:54  halish: ...
13:54  hrwath: mekwall, lol
13:55  mekwall: hold on, going to test on stable
13:55  hrwath: mekwall, but it's like that foreigners always ask for swearings ;-)
13:56  mekwall: hrwath, I never asked :P
13:56  oodavid: halish: what happens when you do: var num = 12.345; alert (num.toFixed(2));
13:57  hrwath: mekwall, good for you :)
13:57  oodavid: does that return with commas too?
13:58  halish: anyone has Safari 5? i'm all linux here
13:58  blackspotwiggins: i have but its in my vm which is awfully slow
13:58  mekwall: halish, I can test on safari
13:59  mekwall: got access to all OSes here
13:59  blackspotwiggins: whoa
13:59  blackspotwiggins: ALL oses?
13:59  halish: mekwall: i would be really grateful
13:59  blackspotwiggins: try opensolaris plx:)
13:59  mekwall: meh
13:59  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, you really take the whole arm...
13:59  blackspotwiggins: :)
13:59  blackspotwiggins: only because i love you
13:59  mekwall: xoxo
14:00  halish: damn you, pidgin on xubuntu:/
14:00  doonie: lies, all lies!
14:00  halish: did i missed something?
14:00  oodavid: halish: safari is webkit, if it works on Chrome(ium) etc it'll likely be fine on SF, not to say you shouldn't test every now and then :D
14:00  blackspotwiggins: nah
14:00  halish: oodavid: i believe it's a js engine issue
14:00  blackspotwiggins: safari is "special"
14:00  doonie: halish yes, blackspotwiggins just came out of the closet
14:00  oodavid: oh mybad
14:00  oodavid: haha
14:01  mekwall: halish, same in stable chrome
14:01  oodavid: I should really read everything first :S
14:01  mekwall: point decimal
14:01  doonie: sean` ff isn't that close to chrome/safari on the second graph ;D
14:01  blackspotwiggins: they have different js engines, which makes some difference
14:01  mekwall: halish, what you want me to test on safari?
14:01  halish: te same thing
14:02  halish: $("#box").css("opacity")
14:02  mekwall: testing on mac os x 10.6
14:02  oodavid: halish: did you test what "toFixed" returns?
14:03  halish: oodavid: what's "toFixed"?
14:03  sean`: doonie, second one it passed safari
14:03  Kolin: anyone have any idea how to hide select options in IE?
14:03  oodavid: halish: it puts a number to a fixed number of decimal places
14:04  oodavid: and is "semi stringy"
14:04  oodavid: var num = 12.345; alert (num.toFixed(2))

14:06  bot-t: mekwall: 12.00
14:06  halish: it first turns to 0, then it fade
14:06  halish: mekwall: i'll investigate more on this, then
14:06  halish: shall i put a bug report?
14:06  mekwall: nah
14:06  oodavid: me neither, it's one of the few number functions that creates string representations
14:06  juha_: i dare you to divide with zero
14:06  mekwall: it's not a jQ bug
14:06  mekwall: must be a bug in the javascript interpreter
14:06  mekwall: or something like that
14:07  oodavid: hmm
14:07  halish: it affects jquery, though
14:07  halish: i'd call it rather cross-browser issue
14:07  oodavid: while it's not a jQ bug, jQ does abstract these things away
14:07  mekwall: true
14:09  halish: well, it seems to me that the easies solution would be a jquery fix
14:09  halish: or am i wrong?
14:10  oodavid: halish: I think it should be a jQ fix
14:10  oodavid: interesting to see how deep that rabbit hole really is though
14:10  doonie: sean`hate safari ;D first thing i did on the mac was install ff ;D
14:10  mytoz: I think it's an issue in the browser's CSS functionality.
14:11  poppiez: mekwall: hey buddy. would you recommend XP or vista if I need to test with multiple versions of IE?
14:11  poppiez: mekwall: just bought VMware. now I just need a copy of wind0ze
14:11  mekwall: poppiez, XP
14:11  poppiez: mekwall: any particular reason why?
14:11  mekwall: poppiez, because it's light :)
14:12  mekwall: poppiez, what do you use yourself?
14:12  poppiez: mekwall: snow leopard
14:12  mekwall: ah ok
14:12  mekwall: well... you could perhaps go for win7
14:12  poppiez: mekwall: but I'll go with XP. don't like vista that much either. I was just thinking windows 7 perhaps
14:12  mekwall: not vista though
14:12  blackspotwiggins: if you need to test ie6, only option is xp
14:12  mekwall: you can have both :)
14:13  blackspotwiggins: otherwise go for 7
14:13  poppiez: mekwall: thanks again. can you buy windows 7 online as an ISO or?
14:13  blackspotwiggins: you can "buy" online and you can buy online
14:13  poppiez: blackspotwiggins: haha
14:13  blackspotwiggins: also, msdnaa/technet/etc.
14:13  oodavid: personally I prefer the VM's on Linux
14:13  mekwall: which is darn expensive
14:14 --- rbeene_ is now known as rbeene
14:14  blackspotwiggins: msdnaa = free ms software
14:14  blackspotwiggins: also, i believe you can use trial versions for 180 adys
14:14  blackspotwiggins: days*
14:14  mekwall: yeah
14:14  mekwall: that would be the best way
14:15  blackspotwiggins: also, dreamspark is awesome for students
14:15  mekwall: poppiez, http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/cc442495.aspx?ITPID=neweffc
14:15  halish: blackspotwiggins:  msdnaa gives it free as long as you study
14:16  halish: at least in poland
14:16  blackspotwiggins: well
14:16  blackspotwiggins: yes
14:16  blackspotwiggins: technically
14:16  blackspotwiggins: it depends on how often the admin at your faculty updates the list
14:16  halish: anyway, why vmware, not virtualbox?
14:17  mekwall: vmware is faster
14:17  blackspotwiggins: it is?
14:17  blackspotwiggins: maybe esx/enterprisy stuff
14:17  Rinthe: i'm trying to edit my right click context menu to make it harder for people to save my images. but when i use the fancy box, how can i target the image that pops out?
14:18  blackspotwiggins: Rinthe, dude give up
14:18  Rinthe: why?
14:18  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, nope... normal workstation is way faster
14:18  blackspotwiggins: if they can see the images, they can save them
14:18  halish: Rinthe: what's the point?
14:18  Rinthe: blackspotwiggins: I know
14:18  blackspotwiggins: i could think of tons ways to do that
14:18  Rinthe: I know they still can if they really wanted to...
14:18  doonie: yes dont waste itttttt
14:18  blackspotwiggins: and if you disable context menu
14:18  blackspotwiggins: you are going to piss off a lot of users
14:18  markj: why bother wasting yourtime then Rinthe ?
14:18  Rinthe: I'm not disabling
14:18  Rinthe: only on the images
14:18  Rinthe: I'm not wasting time
14:19  doonie: flick has it ;D
14:19  Rinthe: it's going to say copy right on the context menu
14:19  AsgarothBelem: that would only work for... the common user
14:19  blackspotwiggins: you can't edit that
14:19  markj: well you are if someone just comes along and clicks view source
14:19  Rinthe: yes it'll block out a lot of common user
14:19  Rinthe: so its not a waste of time..
14:19  blackspotwiggins: halish, krakow?
14:19  Rinthe: guys.. i know it can still be downloaded
14:19  doonie: scriptkiddies are the annoyting ones, which know how to inspect an element
14:19  egrouse: you could always just overlay a 1px transporent gif, stretched to the size of the image directly over the top of it
14:19  Rinthe: but my question is simple: i'm trying to edit my right click context menu to make it harder for people to save my images. but when i use the fancy box, how can i target the image that pops out?
14:19  egrouse: that would get them
14:19  Rinthe: how do i target that image that pops up
14:20  doonie: just place a div over the image
14:21  blackspotwiggins: ugh, the stuff people do for minimal gains
14:21  Rinthe: so i can't target the image itself?
14:21  doonie: also there is a target in the event, which probably has the image info o:}
14:21  blackspotwiggins: onoes they is take my image
14:21  doonie: blackie gimmi all yer imgs!
14:21  Rinthe: blackspotwiggins: ugh, the people stuff ignore...
14:21  blackspotwiggins: doonie, sure
14:22  Rinthe: blackspotwiggins: that kind of thinking doesn't work when you're trying to make something good
14:22  Rinthe: doonie: what target?
14:22  blackspotwiggins: good = restricting what people can do
14:22  blackspotwiggins: kk
14:22  doonie: target of the click
14:22  Rinthe: restricting people from downloading my paintings, yes
14:22  Rinthe: duh
14:23  doonie: restricting 1 of 10000
14:23  Rinthe: i understand
14:23  blackspotwiggins: then why show them in the first place
14:23  Rinthe: but i'm willing to do it
14:23  oodavid: agreed
14:23  oodavid: put a watermark on them
14:23  Rinthe: uhh that question is obvious
14:23  Rinthe: because i want to
14:23  doonie: i've done all the tricks in the book regarding image securing ;D not worth it
14:23  oodavid: "stolen from rinthe.com"
14:23  blackspotwiggins: so you want the people to see them but you dont want people to actually see them
14:23  mekwall: Rinthe, the best way to protect your images is by using a watermark
14:23  Rinthe: ok stop guys haha i dont need any advice
14:24  Rinthe: only want a simple answer to my question
14:24  doonie: sure you do ;D
14:24  doonie: plus I gave the answer
14:24  Rinthe: doonie: okay so
14:24  blackspotwiggins: anyway .target on event object
14:24  mekwall: Rinthe, simple answer is... do not stop people from using context menu :)
14:24  Rinthe: doonie: is the only way to make a div over the image?
14:24  AsgarothBelem: I agree with watermark!
14:24  AsgarothBelem: long live watermark!
14:24  doonie: no use the click event.target
14:24  Rinthe: doonie: how do i get that target?
14:24  doonie: ?g jquery event target
14:24  Rinthe: doonie: not even sure what that is :/

14:33  Rinthe: ok ill take a loook
14:33  AsgarothBelem: Rinthe, what about a callback  on the fancy box?
14:33  AsgarothBelem: onComplete
14:34  AsgarothBelem: and recall whatever you are calling to rebind the contextual menu event
14:34  Rinthe: AsgarothBelem: are you talking about the problem with context menu?
14:34  markj: this channel would be pretty dead most days if people read the docs to be honest
14:34  mytoz: argh. the first thing people should learn is "READ THE DOCS".
14:34  mekwall: Rinthe, it linked to the wrong page... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

14:34  mekwall: that's the one you should take a look at

14:58  pngll: Hi, what is the best way to disable input form during an asynchronous request? If I disable an <input> prior to calling $.ajax, that input's value is not send to the server.
14:58  AsgarothBelem: save the value to a variable before disabling then
14:58  l4rk: oh that kind of mask
14:58  l4rk: awesome
15:01  pngll: AsgarothBelem, argh, not clean. But ok I'll do that.
15:01  halish: is a jquery contributor in the channel?
15:02  Bjornet: hi I want to trigger a submit button as soon as a button is pushed. Prob. is that nothing happens. I use this code:
15:02  Bjornet: http://jsfiddle.net/VTDEh/
15:02  AsgarothBelem: pngll, i know but its the normal browser behaviour
15:03  pngll: AsgarothBelem, yes, but I thought there could be send -> disable -> enable on complete
15:03 --- ThraShown is now known as Shownn
15:04  Bjornet: #book_name is the button pushed that should trigger the Submit
15:04  blackspotwiggins: pngll, you can disable after the request starts
15:04  blackspotwiggins: $.ajax(); $("input").attr("disabled", true);
15:04  AsgarothBelem: mmm I dont think is that ugly to save the serialized form to a variable before disabling the input
15:05  AsgarothBelem: Bjornet, why dont you trigger the form submit event instead?
15:05  AsgarothBelem: $('#myform').submit();
15:05  pngll: blackspotwiggins, obviously.
15:05  Bjornet: thats better i suppose will try it
15:06  pngll: AsgarothBelem, no, I mean I should abstract that away using something similar to knockout.js, but doing manually for every form is not pleasant.
15:06  blackspotwiggins: you can bind ajaxStart or similar to forms to do that for you
15:07  pngll: blackspotwiggins, thanks, I'll look into that.
15:07  blackspotwiggins: ?ajax events

16:04  synax: Last time... http://jsfiddle.net/H3eQR/1/ <-- why is the background-position interpolated in IE but not in other browsers?
16:05  mekwall: I haven't really had the time to keep myself updated actually :/
16:05  mekwall: stuck at home with flu for a week and been totally overloaded with work ever since
16:06  erichynds: yeah
16:06  erichynds: that sounds rough
16:06  erichynds: work is taking all my time lately
16:06  vardump: yeah baby, callback is the solution! i used a callback function in .load, it works fine now
16:06  blackspotwiggins: synax, because jquery ui addclass sets it as inline style
16:06  vardump: thanks!
16:06  kk4hh4: hi how ca i integrate a jQuery-slider in a html-form to easyly submit the sliders value on the submission of the form?
16:06  synax: blackspotwiggins: I don't get why that causes the discrepancy though
16:07  mekwall: vardump, you were lucky this time ;) not very often there is anyone here that want to run through 300+ lines of paste
16:07  Mimo: hehe
16:07  blackspotwiggins: mayeb it doesnt remove
16:07  Rinthe: erichynds: hmm i dont really get it haha. is there a list for this tho?
16:07  mekwall: Mimo++
16:07  blackspotwiggins: i dont know, the timed add/removeclass is black magic for me
16:07  blackspotwiggins: i avoid when possible
16:07  erichynds: Rinthe, I'm sure you could find one somewhere
16:08  mekwall: vardump, next time you should check up on jsfiddle.net - it's great for setting ut test cases and makes it easy for us to help
16:08  mcella: mekwall: better parents('body'), if the element is inside another element that's the one being removed .parent() still gives it? right?
16:08  vardump: @mekwall: thanks! didn't know, that the site exists
16:08  Trisox: better parents :O
16:08  mekwall: vardump, also, if the code works on jsfiddle, then you'll know that there's something else that's wrong and that you are looking in the wrong place.
16:09  mekwall: vardump, it's a great tool! i use it daily :)
16:09  mekwall: mcella, probably me... but I didn't get that :D
16:10  mcella: mekwall: not it's my english :-)
16:10  mekwall: 50 minutes left of friday work day... so I guess I might be a bit friend
16:10  mekwall: fried*
16:10  mcella: mekwall: if I check just .parent() for my element and this element is inside another one that's been removed .parent() will still return it
16:11  mekwall: mcella, yeah... that's true :)
16:11  mcella: mekwall: using .parents('body') so that I'm sure it's not attached to the body
16:11  mcella: right?
16:11  mekwall: mcella, yeah if you don't control the amount of elements that's detatched then it's good, but it's also slower
16:12  mcella: mekwall: yeah, that's right
16:12  blackspotwiggins: $.contains is fastar'
16:12  mcella: mekwall: do you think is slower .parents('body') or searching again for the element? sorry if i bother you :-)
16:13  mekwall: mcella, np... I'm not bothered
16:13  mekwall: mcella, .parents('body') is slower then .parent()
16:13  blackspotwiggins: dudes
16:13  blackspotwiggins: $.contains
16:13  sean`: lol
16:13  sean`: .parents ('body') ?
16:13  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, not really
16:13  sean`: $(document.body)
16:14  mekwall: not in this case
16:14  Rinthe: how do i check if fancybox is popped open or not?
16:14  blackspotwiggins: why not?
16:14  sean`: WHY NOT
16:14  sean`: telllllllllllllllllllllll me
16:14  mekwall: see, he have an element... and he need to see if it's detatched or not
16:14  blackspotwiggins: so?
16:14  sean`: ?closest @ mcella
16:14  bot-t: mcella, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
16:14  Trisox: dont tell sean anything
16:14  Trisox: sttt
16:14  Trisox: ;)
16:14  blackspotwiggins: closest or contains is always faster than parent/parents
16:15  mekwall: sean is so cute when he is clueless
16:15  sean`: Then do contains with the dom nodes
16:15  luxigo: blackspotwiggings: not when you look for body
16:15  Trisox: time for coffee
16:15  sean`: Does that mean I'm cute all the time
16:15  sean`: ?
16:15  mcella: whoa! :-)
16:15  mcella: so guys, what's the best thing to do? :-D
16:16  mekwall: well... I'm not sure if I want to hop on the contains-bandwagon yet
16:16  Mimo: yeah i'm curious aswel
16:16  mekwall: I'd like to do a bench :)
16:16  mcella: :-D
16:17  zamba: i'm using the validation plugin for jquery to make sure that the form input is sane before actually submitting it.. how can i make sure that a set of input fields are unique?
16:17  Bjornet: Jonz: I tried with .live('click' function(){}) instead of .click(function(){}) - also tried to execute the jquery below the form. But nothing good came out of it
16:17  Mimo: i would like the answer
16:17  mekwall: $.contains(elem, document.body) vs $(elem).parent(); ...
16:17  blackspotwiggins: im looking into it..
16:17  mekwall: $.contains should be faster if using .parents though
16:17  Bjornet: Still no Submit sent when I press one of my Order label:s
16:18  Rinthe: how do i check if fancybox is popped open or not?
16:18  Mimo: figure out what changed when you open fancybox
16:18  Mimo: i don't know fancybox... example?
16:19  sean`: you know
16:19  Trisox: he knows
16:19  blackspotwiggins: hmm
16:19  sean`: mcella, .is (':visible') will return false if the elemnt isn't onthe page
16:19  sean`: is detached
16:19  blackspotwiggins: you just want to detect if it is detached
16:19  blackspotwiggins: that's it?
16:19  blackspotwiggins: im making sure my test is right
16:20  mcella: yeah, just want to know if it's been removed from the dom
16:20  mcella: I've got this reference
16:20  sean`: mcella, http://jsfiddle.net/8T9GN/
16:21  blackspotwiggins: http://jsperf.com/parent-test
16:21  mcella: note that if removed it's not removed directly (it's a span inside a another div that's the one being removed)
16:21  guy: can anyone suggest jQuery plugin like this http://jsbin.com/emovo but for the situation when you have hundreds of records so that instead plugin would generate paging like: prev, 1, 2, 3, .., 14, 15, 16, ..., 33, 34, 35, next
16:21  Bjornet: I want to trigger the submit every time a Lable for a Radiobutton is pushed. How do I do this?
16:21  blackspotwiggins: parent is 96% slower for me
16:21  Bjornet: I tried with this code but nothing happens..
16:22  Mimo: 71% here
16:22  blackspotwiggins: so SUCK IT PARENT() LOVERS
16:22  Bjornet: http://jsfiddle.net/VTDEh/10/
16:23  sean`: blackspotwiggins, http://jsperf.com/parent-test/2
16:23  sean`: you were saying?
16:24  blackspotwiggins: contains is faster than parent()
16:24  blackspotwiggins: which is true
16:24  sean`: blackspotwiggins, but my native dom pwns u
16:24  temp01: contains uses native dom methods internally
16:24  sean`: I know
16:25  sean`: which is useful to check if an element is inside another, but if you want to see if it's not in the dom.. then this muchos fasteros
16:25  temp01: I know
16:25  IdahoEv: how do I disable some of the <option> elements in a <select> with jquery?
16:25  sean`: I know
16:25  Mimo: you know
16:25  blackspotwiggins: i know that sean knows that temp01 knows
16:25  mcella: is contains jquery 1.4.x?
16:25  temp01: ?contains#sig
16:25  bot-t: Selector - :contains(text) | Added in v1.1.4. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
16:25  sean`: !
16:26  temp01: ?jquery.contains#sig
16:26  bot-t: jQuery.contains( container, contained ) | Returns: Boolean | Added in v1.4. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
16:26  temp01: mcella knows
16:26  sean`: too fast for me today :p
16:26  mcella: cool
16:26  IdahoEv: i've tried both $('element').disable()  and $('element').attr("disabled", true), but I get "an HTMLOptionElement has no method 'attr'
16:26  Mimo: too fast? use parrent()
16:26  temp01: IdahoEv: that means $ isn't jquery
16:27  Rinthe: ok the first hotkey works, any idea why the 2nd two doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/DxQfR8dS
16:30  zamba: IdahoEv: i'm not able to get .disable() working, but .attr("disabled", true) works
16:30  temp01: disable is not a method
16:32  ThinkingMan: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130746229&ps=cprs
16:32  serio: sure it is! function disable( $obj ) { $obj.attr( "disabled", true ) };
16:32  IdahoEv: here's my actual code:  http://pastie.org/1240791
16:32  ThinkingMan: whoops, wrong channel, sorry fellas
16:34  IdahoEv: in any case, when i halt in the debugger, option looks to me like a jQuery object for the right DOM element, but it errors as if there's no method 'attr'.
16:35  guy: why data becomes undefined in callback function? http://jsbin.com/eyime5/edit
16:35  guy: isn't it is global? and how to solve this
16:36  yonk: I have a form that check if the username it's taken. and i want to check the username after some milisecond that user keyup the last keyup
16:36  serio: guy, yes
16:36  serio: or come up with a way to actually pass data to the callback function
16:36  serio: because it isn't in your current code.
16:37  aaroncicali: I know somewhere there's a list of normalized e.which values... ENTER, ESC ... is that in ui?  anyone know where I can find the reference?
16:37  serio: the scope of the data variable is limited to the render() function in your current example.
16:37  aaroncicali: thanks
16:38  Rinthe: the first hotkey works, any idea why the 2nd two doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/DxQfR8dS
16:44  xckpd7: I have a jQuery UI question that kind of leaks into the CSS space: in the jQuery UI icons, they have a little grippy icon... I want to use that, except I have a long item I want to repeat that pattern for
16:45  xckpd7: like this: imgur.com/T7iZq.png
16:46  serio: xckpd7, you'll most likely need to create your own bg.
16:46  IdahoEv: Can someone look at my pastie (http://pastie.org/1240791) and tell me what I'm doing wrong?  It looks like temp01 is correct in that 'this', which I'm calling .attr() on, is just a plain DOM element not a jquery object.   But I don't understand why.  Inside an each() iterator, shouldn't 'this' reflect a jquery object of the element being iterated?
16:46  xckpd7: serio: k, thanks
16:47  temp01: IdahoEv: use $(this)
16:47  IdahoEv: right
16:47  IdahoEv: one of these days i'll actually start to understand jquery :/
16:47  serio: reading the documentation helps :)
16:48  Brodingo: or better yet cache it! var $this = $(this)
16:48  Brodingo: if'n u gonna be usin' it more than once
16:48  mekwall: eh
16:48  IdahoEv: well, that's what i've been doing (reading the docs), but it's very slow going when I don't yet know enough to know what i'm looking for
16:48  mekwall: jsperf is behaving weird
16:48  IdahoEv: still on the slow part of the learning curve with jquery
16:48  IdahoEv: anyway, thanks everyone
16:49  temp01: api.jquery.com/each tells you that this will be an element and in the examples, you can see that it uses $(this)
16:50  Rinthe: the first hotkey works, any idea why the 2nd two doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/DxQfR8dS the two links are <span class="newer"><a href=""></a></span> and <span class="older"><a href=""></a></span>
16:50  mekwall: http://jsperf.com/is-element-detached
16:50  mekwall: wth is wrong with that? :)
16:50  serio: xckpd7, which jQuery UI Interaction are you trying to customize?
16:51  serio: maybe I can lend a hand, as it sounds like you've been at it for two days now...
16:51  Brodingo: rinthe i think you can just do event.preventDefault() at the beginning
16:51  serio: yes, he can
16:51  serio: and he should
16:51  temp01: Rinthe: a) what do you expect .click() to do, 2) is $('.newer > a') matching anything?
16:52  temp01: if he does that, it will prevent all keys
16:52  Rinthe: i expect .click() to click that link
16:52  Brodingo: will it?
16:52  serio: oh yah
16:52  Rinthe: well the markup is <span class="newer"><a href=""></a></span> and <span class="older"><a href=""></a></span>
16:52  temp01: it won't navigate to new page
16:52  Brodingo: hm yeah i understand
16:52  Rinthe: hmm so how do i make it do that?
16:53  mekwall: $foo = [div#foo] ... but I get $("#foo").detatch is not a function ?!
16:53  temp01: Rinthe: location.href = $(..).attr('href')
16:55  serio: oh temp01, we'd be lost without you
16:55  Brodingo: we all would
16:55  Brodingo: i mean the world
16:55  Brodingo: i guess that was implied
16:56  mekwall: I get .detatch is not a function
16:56  mekwall: that's interesting :)
16:57  mekwall: ffs
16:58  mekwall: why oh why didn't anyone tell me that my spelling is WRONG?!
16:58  mekwall: haha
16:58  oodavid: has anyone ever come accross a UX testing plugin?
16:58 * mekwall bashes his head to the wall
16:58  Rinthe: Brodingo: funny when i do event.preventDefault() it doesnt work in IE, only if i do e.preventDefault()
16:58  serio: it's whatever it is at the end of the function
16:58  Brodingo: um sorry i usually use event, its whatever you pass to the function
16:59  Rinthe: ohh
16:59  serio: if you use e, you need to use e.preventDefault
16:59  serio: you could make it event
16:59  Brodingo: yeah sorry rinthe
16:59  Rinthe: right
16:59  Rinthe: no
16:59  Rinthe: my bad
16:59  serio: it's just the param
16:59  Rinthe: that was dumb haha
16:59  Brodingo: i like to be more verbose usually
16:59  serio: and e means event anyway
16:59  Brodingo: helps readability for me
16:59  Rinthe: ah okay
17:00  Rinthe: thanks temp01: that worked great :)
17:01 --- Mongin__ is now known as warpdesign__
17:02  serio: you could make e myawesomeeventparam
17:02  serio: then be like myawesomeeventparam.preventDefault()
17:02  temp01: .bind('click', function(crossBrowserEventObject){ })
17:02  vol7ron: is .live() inefficient?
17:03  bartzy: Hi,
17:03  bartzy: Is it possible to make a UI Draggable object a bit more draggable than it's containment ?
17:03  serio: vol7ron, it's heavier than using bind, yes
17:03  serio: but it depends on use case
17:03  bartzy: meaning just 5px outside the border of the containment, both right and left ?
17:03  serio: to say it's inefficient would be inaccurate.
17:04  vol7ron: serio, i'm trying to apply a class to a few of the datepicker's divs, but it seems the only way i can do that after selecting a new month is with a div
17:04  vol7ron: serio, excuse me, with "live()"
17:04  vol7ron: not being able to bind
17:05  serio: I
17:05  serio: erf
17:05  serio: can you not listen for the datepicker's onchange and bind when that is called,
17:06  serio: it doesn't sound like you would need to use live() in this case, but I would have to see
17:06  c_schmitz: Hi everyone
17:06  vol7ron: serio, by on change, you mean onChangeMonthYear?
17:07  serio: er
17:07  serio: onSelect rather
17:07  serio: but there's a bunch of events you could use.
17:07  c_schmitz: I am just having a dumb moment, I want to select the checkbox of all the checkbox in the same table raw (the selecting one is one the same row). How would i do that?            $(this).closest('tr').children('input').attr('checked',true); does not work?
17:07  freedgy: Hey everyone. I'm using .animate() to slide some large images (800x500) to the left. Right now I'm using the jswing easeing and I notice some clipping on the images while they slide. I'm guessing this is due to the image size.. is there anyway to lessen the clipping or hide it?
17:07  vol7ron: serio, there's no events i could use
17:08  vol7ron: serio, the problem is you can't add a class to something that's not created.  when you select a new month, the calendar is re-created
17:08  vol7ron: serio, what I've done is made it so that the calendar is more of a servlet.  it's inline and when you double click the header, only the month appears
17:08  serio: I didn't relize you were trying to affect the callendar itself.
17:09  vol7ron: s/servlet/portlet/
17:09  c_schmitz: freedgy, usually that is more a problem of the used browser - every browser is up to the task differently
17:09  c_schmitz: don't think you can do anything about it
17:10  c_schmitz: I am just having a dumb moment, I want to select the checkbox of all the checkbox in the same table raw (the selecting one is one the same row). How would i do that?            $(this).closest('tr').children('input').attr('checked',true); does not work?
17:10  freedgy: c_schmitz: ohh you're right.. firefox has a little jitter / clipping, but Chrome is real smooth :(
17:11  mekwall: ?source contains

17:14  jomofcw: Hi there =)
17:15  kk4hh4: hi how ca i integrate a jQuery-slider in a html-form to easyly submit the sliders value on the submission of the form?
17:16  danheberden: slider({change: function() { $('#yourForm').submit() });
17:16  danheberden: but, er.. that might suck
17:16  danheberden: might want to do some nifty ajax call instead
17:17  danheberden: butttttt the moral of the story, use the change event :)
17:18 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
17:20  kk4hh4: danheberden: will this submit the slider.value into my form or submit the form on change of the slider?
17:20  danheberden: lol, well the above would fire the submit of your form - which may or may not be setup to do an ajax request or not
17:22  bartzy: Is it possible to make a UI Draggable object a bit more draggable than it's containment ?
17:22  bartzy: meaning just 5px outside the border of the containment, both right and left ?
17:22 --- tj is now known as Guest9470
17:23  kk4hh4: danheberden: but i want the long form, where the slider is used to define only one <input value=""> and the form to be submited by an ordinary button
17:23 --- Guest9470 is now known as tjholowaychuk
17:25  danheberden: kk4hh4: so update the input in your form with the slider value on change
17:25  Hoe``: Is there anyway to make a link not follow in a .click() event but not prevent propagation which happens when you do return false?
17:26  danheberden: change: function(e, ui) { $('#yourCoolInput').val( ui.value ) }
17:26  danheberden: Hoe``: manually preventDefault but don't preventPropagation
17:27  danheberden: click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* do your shitnit */
17:27  Hoe``: ahhh, thank you :)
17:27  danheberden: don't return false
17:27  danheberden: ?misuse return false

17:27  Hoe``: hahaha thanks :X
17:28  Hoe``: i'll just say i didn't know any better, it was my up bringing :(
17:28  danheberden: correct - blaming parents is always encouraged
17:30  serio: blaming parents() is always encouraged
17:30  serio: blaming .parents() .is() always encouraged
17:30  Hoe``: .parents().detach()
17:30  Hoe``: wait, that's suicide
17:31  destinydriven: hello to all
17:32  _dave_h_d: hello all, can someone tell me about 3d transform and if jquery draggable could utilize that when drag dorpping a div with thousands of elements on it as it seems quite slow on firefox
17:32  _dave_h_d: or rather jerkkey
17:32  _dave_h_d: so the idea behind my question really is if hardware acceleration could be utilized somehow when doing drag and drop?
17:33 --- frigginWork is now known as seutje
17:33  Hoe``: out of curiosity, how's it run in chrome/opera/ie9?
17:33  _dave_h_d: Hoe``: well safari is the best
17:33  Hoe``: they generally are considered to be much faster with js
17:33  _dave_h_d: i am using a mac
17:33  Hoe``: ahh
17:33  _dave_h_d: chrome is close second
17:33  Joikus: hi
17:33  _dave_h_d: ie9 i have not even tried
17:33  Hoe``: i haven't either, waiting for final, and i need to target ie8 :(
17:34  ejb: I have a click event on a link that opens a modal dialog but the browser loads the link target almost immediately. How can I have the browser load the link target only once the dialog has been closed?
17:34  _dave_h_d: i have tried crome on a pc, a bit slower than chrome on a mac
17:34  _dave_h_d: or about the same
17:34  Hoe``: ie8/ff are my targets, my two least favorites!
17:34  Joikus: I have to work with the follow <ul> http://pastebin.com/38hGjrGT - How can I using jquery, add some magic to prevent uses from multiple clicking these <li> tabs?
17:35  Joikus: sorry, dopostback is here http://pastebin.com/1LtzWEQs
17:36  serio: you only want the links to be clicked once?
17:37  Joikus: yea I want the page to be submitted once, and prevent users from clicking many times
17:37  Hoe``: you'd need to do something like if (!$(this).attr("data-been-clicked")) { do click stuff; $(this).attr("data-been-clicked", "true"); }
17:38  Hoe``: if it's a button just disable it until the response comes back
17:38  Joikus: thing is I can't control the <ul><li> that got rendered
17:38  Joikus: I can only use JS
17:39  Hoe``: the above data-been-clicked stuff will make anything do the 'do click stuff;' code only once
17:39  Hoe``: each one will only be clickable once
17:39  Joikus: hmmm
17:39  Joikus: stupid asp.net control
17:39  Joikus: <asp:BulletedList DisplayMode="LinkButton" ID="Tabs" runat="server" CssClass="tabs" EnableViewState="false" OnClick="Tabs_Click" />

18:11  temp01: ejb: hmm yeah, possible
18:11  Joikus: $(this).removeAttr("href")  won't work in my case because the page wont submit :] I need the first doPostBack to work
18:12  temp01: ejb: but you say it closes the dialog
18:13  l4rk: Joikus: a post back reloads the entire page fyi

19:06  diamonds: and you'd mouse over
19:06  temp01: ejb: repaste
19:06  diamonds: and the box would split in 4 smaller squares and remove themselves diagonally
19:06  diamonds: revealing some other content behind
19:08  ejb: temp01: I don't need it to load the page right now so that's commented out... http://pastebin.com/PYaxtrvM
19:08  dub54: can anyone help me sort out my drop down menu? http://pastebin.com/sD8tjRXS trying to get the second level to show to the right but it wont show up
19:08  vol7ron: Alright does anyone find this useful? http://jsfiddle.net/vol7ron/BknKU/7/
19:09  Rinthe: umm ok now i have http://pastebin.com/2AWe4Pbq but it's still not working in IE. working everywhere else tho..
19:09  explodes: How do I add a background color to a set of matched elements?
19:09  vol7ron: Rinthe, whats your problem?
19:09  temp01: .css('background-color', 'red') explodes
19:09  explodes: tahnks thanks
19:09  Rinthe: vol7ron: in IE, when fancybox opens up, and i hit the same hotkey, it just tries to open fancybox again instead of trying to close it
19:10  ajpiano: vol7ron, you know about parseInt, right?
19:10  diamonds: I found it!!! :) http://www.queness.com/resources/html/slicing/index.html
19:10  ajpiano: diamonds++
19:11  vol7ron: ajpiano, yes.
19:11  diamonds: that's a sweet effect...
19:11  ajpiano: vol7ron: is there a reason you aren't using it :p
19:11  vol7ron: ajpiano, in the JS sense, I dont know if there is a jQuery parseInt
19:11  serio: lol
19:11  ajpiano: there isn't a 'jquery everything;'
19:11  ajpiano: you use javascript's parseInt
19:12  diamonds: Kevin Liew++ really <-- the author
19:12  pifantastic: rofl
19:12  ajpiano: unless you're under the impression that you're using the "jQuery Multiply By One" method
19:12  diamonds: lawl
19:12  vol7ron: ajpiano, jQuery likes to take things and adopt
19:12  vol7ron: *1 is faster than parseInt
19:12  vol7ron: that's why.
19:13  ajpiano: vol7ron: is doing a string replace and then multiplying by one faster than parseInt ?
19:13  vol7ron: ajpiano, that's questionable
19:13  ajpiano: yes it is
19:13  ejb: temp01: thoughts?
19:13  vol7ron: for such a small string, it may be
19:14  vol7ron: ajpiano, definitely worth a bench test :)
19:14  ajpiano: vol7ron, on it
19:14  ajpiano: :p
19:14  vol7ron: :)
19:14  mang0skittle: pifantastic: ? wondering if I could get a bit more assistance from you, to add on that toggle to change the link text?
19:15  vol7ron: ajpiano, instead of doing the replace, i was just going to truncate the last two characters of the string, though
19:15  vol7ron: which should be faster than replace
19:15  pifantastic: mang0skittle: kk
19:16  pifantastic: mang0skittle: what text do you need to toggle?
19:17  Rinthe: vol7ron: any ideas?
19:17  vol7ron: Rinthe, I got sidetracked :)
19:17  Rinthe: vol7ron: haha :p
19:17  mang0skittle: pifantastic: The link, I need it to go from saying like "View all" to "Hide" or something and toggles along with the...toggle..
19:18  vol7ron: to be honest i dont use fancybox
19:18  temp01: ejb: use destroy instead of close
19:19  mang0skittle: I tried to turn it into like a toggle with two functions but that broke things a bit
19:21  ejb: temp01: thanks
19:22  ajpiano: vol7ron http://jsperf.com/parseint-vs-times-one
19:22  ajpiano: parseInt kicks the other two methods' ass
19:23  ajpiano: and has the advantage of actually existing for the explicit purpose of doing what you're trying to do
19:23  pifantastic: mang0skittle: unfortunatly its going to need to be more verbose for that http://pastebin.com/ACDww8qN
19:23  vol7ron: ajpiano, i have to verify first
19:24  mang0skittle: oh hmm maye I had too many ()
19:24  mang0skittle: 1 second
19:27  vol7ron: ajpiano did you try with an array slice?
19:27  mang0skittle: pifantastic: the toggle still works fine but the link text doesn't change, something other than .text?
19:28  vol7ron: ajpiano, var a = "1024px";  a.slice(0,-2); -- and some variation of the text, "0px", "1024px" (this shouldn't make much of a difference)
19:30  pifantastic: mang0skittle: it doesnt make a lot of sense to append an <a> to a <ul>
19:30  sneakyness: lol, this jquery freelance crap I'm doing is so bad, the only thing I can do is wrap all of his calls in if statements and tell him that band aids are the best I can offer short of a full rewrite
19:30  mang0skittle: I should move it out to the wrapper probably
19:31  Rinthe: i have http://pastebin.com/2AWe4Pbq but it's still not working in IE. working everywhere else tho.. ok so IE, the if statement of check for #fancybox-img visibility doesn't seem to work. any ideas?
19:33  mang0skittle: pifantastic: actually the end result is just to have a jquery added link after that list that the user can use to toggle more or less of the list to see
19:33  Brodingo: rinthe maybe try to log the condition and see what ie says
19:33  mang0skittle: pifantastic: But right now my focus is trying to get the toggle to actually work, then I can move it about
19:33  Rinthe: brodingo: how do i log it?
19:34  jedatu: Does anyone know if there is an issue with fadeIn in Safari4 and on the iPad?
19:34  stanmancan: Is there anything built into the jquery ui datepicker to specifiy that one field has to be after another? I know you can set a date range but this will need to be dynamic. I have a "start date" and "stop date" field and the stop date will have to be after the start date
19:34  ajpiano: vol7ron: so my comp just ate a dick
19:35  ajpiano: vol7ron but uh.. parseInt was a hell of a lot faster in chrome, like a million times faster in webkit, and a bajillion times faster in firefox
19:36  fermion: is it just me or are there no tests committed to jquery-mobile yet?
19:37  t0th_--: autocomplete ui?
19:38  Brodingo: rinthe go here http://paulirish.com/2009/log-a-lightweight-wrapper-for-consolelog/
19:38  nail_: stanmancan: you could $yourdatepicker.datepicker("option", "minDate", $yourotherdatepicker.datepicker("getDate")) ?
19:39  ajpiano: vol7ron ?
19:40  mang0skittle: pifantastic: maybe .after() is what I need instead
19:41  t0th_--: i have this ajax
19:41  t0th_--: http://www.lojasnoparaguai.com.br/ajax/autosuggest?term=pl
19:41  MichaelBehan: Can jQuery get text width?
19:41  t0th_--: how i can print with special chars ção (example)
19:42  vol7ron: ajpiano, i'm trying stuff out: http://jsperf.com/parseint-vs-times-one/4
19:42  vol7ron: notice that slice w/o the multiply is much much faster in chrome
19:42  serio: t0th_--, just look up the character codes
19:42  t0th_--: [serio]: how?
19:43  serio: ?lmgtfy html spanish chars @ t0th_--
19:43  bot-t: t0th_--, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=html+spanish+chars
19:43  ajpiano: vol7ron: but you need to do both steps, so why go with something so much more verbose
19:43  t0th_--: hmmm
19:43  vol7ron: because there are otherways around that :)
19:43  ajpiano: why do you hate parseInt so much
19:44  ajpiano: what did it ever do to you
19:45  nlogax: once, i forgot the radix arg, and parseInt blew up my house
19:45  serio: ajpiano, It parsed strings and turned them into integers, that's what it fucking did!
19:46  ajpiano: BUT I KNOW HOW TO PARSE STRINGS... AND ALSO TURN THEM INTO INTEGERS
19:46  ajpiano: so imma just do that instead
19:46  serio: lol
19:46  erichynds: vol7ron, try split("
19:46  erichynds: vol7ron, try split("p")[0]
19:47  zef88: Hello, does anybody know why isnt this working? vb.text(vb.text().replace("veces","hola"))
19:47  zef88: I just want to replace some text
19:47  zef88: this using jquery =>     $('.voteBox').text($('.voteBox').text().replace("veces","hola"))
19:47  vol7ron: erichynds that will probably take so long
19:48  erichynds: i bet it's faster than replace and substr
19:48  serio: I don't know about that actually
19:48  vastak: zef88, because you aren't setting the  text just replacing what text() returns
19:48  serio: replace is usually faster than doing split/join
19:50  erichynds: also instead of *1, try like +"300px".slice(0,-2)
19:50  vol7ron: erich already ahead of you
19:50  vol7ron: http://jsperf.com/parseint-vs-times-one/5
19:50  vol7ron: ajpiano, yep I'm not finding anything that is definitively faster
19:51 * ajpiano surprisedn't
19:51  nail_: t0th_--: one thing that works to convert html entities is $('<div>').html(yourstring).text()
19:52  temp01: vastak: he is. setting. the text
19:53  vastak: temp01, yeah I just saw the first .text()
19:53  mstef: hey..trying to call a flash function from jquery..i have no problem calling it from regular javascript, but can't seem to do with with jquery..
19:53  mstef: working js is: var fxControl = document.GacMapLoader || window.GacMapLoader;
19:54  mstef: then fxControl.function(args);
19:54  mstef: anyone know what has to be done to do this with jquery
19:54  mstef: tried $('#id-of-flash-movie').function() - nothing
19:54  jkline: vol7ron: it keeps telling me that parseInt is the fastest
19:54  serio: you don't need jQuery to create a proxy between flash and javasciprt
19:54  temp01: ?but @ jkline
19:54  serio: *script*
19:54  bot-t: jkline, BUTT
19:54  vol7ron: jkline: different browsers
19:55  vol7ron: parseInt takes the cake
19:55 --- NIKO is now known as niko
19:55  jkline: vol7ron: yeah, i see that "t.slice(0, -2)" is fastest in chrome, but parseInt is faster in FF and Safari
19:56  jkline: i should go try IE
19:56  serio: mstef, you need to read up on ExternalInterface, and ensure the flash file is set up properly.
19:56  serio: mstef, http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/external/ExternalInterface.html
19:56  ajpiano: jkline: yeah, but that one isn't actually casting to the number part
19:56  ajpiano: so it's just there.... because... of something
19:56  serio: why you would ask such a question in #jQuery is beyond me.
19:56  jkline: ajpiano: psha, details !
19:56 --- bbttxu_ is now known as bbttxu
19:56  mstef: serio: tried it with no luck..getting 'invalid object initializer'.. i'll look again thanks
19:57  vol7ron: the problem with ie is you have to modify the registry so you don't get that error alert
19:57  mstef: serio: the flash works with plain javascript fine though..any idea why jquery would be having problems? or something specific i have to do?
19:57  vol7ron: ajpiano: it's there just to be a benchmark to see if its capable of being faster
19:57  serio: you don't need jQuery to instantiate a function inside flash
19:57  serio: it's not like jQuery will make it easier or some shit.
19:58  vol7ron: ajpiano: as you stated, there are two parts, if the first part isn't fast enough, then there's no way it would beat out parseInt
19:58  ajpiano: i think we've beat this one to death :p
19:58  mstef: serio: well i have a number of other things going on that will have to call the flash and pass values over, etc.. jquery is just so much easier
19:59  vol7ron: ajpiano... never :)
19:59  jkline: ajpiano: but i'm still fireing up my windows vm to test in IE
19:59  jkline: i should ha
19:59  jkline: ave
19:59  RingZer0: i must be having a brainfart... how do i get a selector only for the first level of nested elements...
19:59  jkline: i should have 6, 7, and 8 somewheres
19:59  jkline: >
19:59  RingZer0: e.g. $('ul li');
19:59  vol7ron: in the effort of better, higher-performing code this debate should remain, especially for jquery
19:59  jkline: or .children()
19:59  evelio50098: Hi ... people, I've got a problem with mouseup 'cuz "return false" doesn't work. This is the code http://pastebin.com/k051Q1uB, but the 2 alerts show despite "return false" in the first function
19:59 --- BBBB is now known as ollie
20:00  jkline: RingZer0: > or children()
20:00  RingZer0: but I only want the first level
20:00  zef88: ?.version
20:00  bot-t: zef88, Version 1.4 - All the aspects of the API that were added, or had a new signature added, in the corresponding version of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4/
20:00  RingZer0: jkline, ah, alright.
20:00  zef88: ?.version()
20:00  bot-t: zef88, Version 1.4 - All the aspects of the API that were added, or had a new signature added, in the corresponding version of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4/
20:00  RingZer0: that's better, i was using next()
20:00  jkline: RingZer0: I think children is the first level and find is all descendants
20:00  ajpiano: vol7ron: i don't really know if finding manual methods to maybe eke out infinitessimally small perf gains over a native method is of the utmost importance, tbh
20:00  RingZer0: yeah, children is still performing the same way :P
20:01  temp01: zef88: $.fn.jquery to get the version
20:02  vol7ron: ajpiano: w/ the way smartphones are adopting more and more, it is important.
20:02  mstef: serio: so no ideas?
20:03  evelio50098: someone knows what can I do ?
20:03  vol7ron: ajpiano: jquery will only grow, so you want to prevent bloat.  it also means you can load/do more if you have that much more perf.
20:03  jkline: RingZer0: can you show an example of your problem or did you get it working?
20:03  ajpiano: vol7ron: i am pretty sure there a lot of other performance roadblocks for mobile than the performance of parseInt versus a bunch of string parsing
20:04  ajpiano: like the fact that jquery 1.4.3 has mad regressions yo
20:04  vol7ron: ajpiano: this is only one place to realize that.  since jquery does a lot of things with width/height manipulation, this is really important.  especially when considering those portions that are called more than once.
20:04  vol7ron: this particular example is only setting the min/max once, but what if you're calculating over and over.  especially on mouse movement
20:05  ajpiano: it is really imporant, but if there was something *faster* than parseInt i'm sure people would have discovered it by now
20:05  vol7ron: ajpiano: yes
20:05  vol7ron: :)
20:05  RingZer0: jkline, I am trying to do $('ul').children('li').hover(fun{},fun{})
20:05  ajpiano: also, you need to optimise the things that have room for improvement
20:06  ajpiano: if 99.9 percent of jquery/jquery ui is spent doing other things than parsing integers, there are extremely limited gains to be found from optimzing that
20:06  jkline: RingZer0: why not just $('ul > li ').hover
20:06  RingZer0: Technically I have $('div#navigation ul').children('li').hover
20:06  RingZer0: jkline, great
20:06  serio: we're still fucking talking about this parseInt nonsense?
20:06  RingZer0: so > is direct decendents, and that works in css too?
20:06  temp01: serio: yes.
20:06  ajpiano: serio, evidently :p
20:07  RingZer0: > is not to be inherited?
20:07  hsbot:   <no location info>: parse error (possibly incorrect indentation)
20:07  serio: "let's make parseInt better"
20:07  Brodingo: jkline ringzer0, what about just $('#navigation').children()
20:07  jkline: RingZer0: yes > is direct children, and I think that works in css too. Not sure what browsers. However, there is no need to use element#id, always just use #id
20:07  temp01: ?child @ RingZer0
20:07  bot-t: RingZer0, parent > child: Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
20:08  serio: I'm sure that's exactly what John Resig was thinking when he first thought of jQuery
20:08  serio: "How can I make parseInt better"
20:08  RingZer0: temp01, for some reason when using children to get all of the li's drectly under the ul, it is inheriting.
20:08  jkline: serio: I think he gave a talk on that at one of the conferences
20:08  evelio50098: someone could help me with the event "mouseup"
20:08  jkline: RingZer0: make a jsfiddle of your example
20:08  serio: and, "how can I run functions in flash from javscript better"
20:08  temp01: RingZer0: are you sure? maybe it's whatever you are doing with the elements that's making you think it's "inheriting"
20:09  pifantastic: I dont even use ints, just strings
20:09  pifantastic: and arrays are fucking buggy as all hell
20:10  pifantastic: I just use variables with sequential names
20:10  serio: I only use one data type in everything I do
20:10  RingZer0:  $('#navigation ul > li').hover(function(){ ..... #navigation is a div
20:10  serio: wtf?
20:10  temp01: RingZer0: yeah, it's hover then.
20:10  RingZer0: that same function is happening at #nav ul li ul li
20:10  serio: nothing but strings!
20:10  temp01: RingZer0: events bubble
20:10  RingZer0: temp01, teach me about events bubble
20:10  temp01: RingZer0: you have google.
20:10  temp01: ?g event bubbling
20:10  bot-t: temp01, Javascript - Event order - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
20:11  zef88: what could this old JQUERY selector be changed into in order to be compatible with newest release? : a[@rel=1]
20:11  temp01: you need to change your markup to  <ul><li><span>item</span><ul><li>....  then bind to the spans using $('ul > li > span')
20:11  temp01: zef88: remove @.
20:11  temp01: zef88: that was changed like an year ago
20:12  zef88: thank you :D
20:12  zef88: what did @ mean?
20:12  temp01: attribute selector
20:12  RingZer0: I will do the same thing but use my anchor that is already there rather than the span.
20:12  zef88: so it was taken away just like that
20:12  serio: it's kind of useless
20:13  serio: [] implies attribute
20:13  temp01: zef88: it was deprecated for some time
20:13  temp01: zef88: then finally removed
20:13  temp01: in jquery 1.3
20:13  toastyghost: can't use other operators in conjunction with the old way of doing it
20:13  temp01: we're at 1.4.3 now
20:13  evelio50098: zef88: yes, lightbox used that
20:13  toastyghost: but you can put *= or whatever into the []
20:13  serio: toastyghost, yes
20:14  evelio50098: toastyghost: you are right
20:14  t0th_--: how i can transform placa m&atilde;e to placa mãe ?
20:14  RingZer0: temp01, that cannot be, when the hover unhovers from the span, the ul disappears....
20:14  RingZer0: temp01, it can't be bound to the span, as the span does not wrap around the nested ul
20:14  temp01: RingZer0: yeah, I see now
20:15  temp01: RingZer0: why is the bubbling causing problems for you?
20:15  temp01: what are you doing in hover()
20:15  serio: t0th_--, wrap it with html()
20:15 --- niko is now known as NIKO

23:19  zef88: Hello, does anybody know what is .unclick for?
23:19  sean`: if you do - .offset, then it'll be the px you're INSIDe of the element
23:19  zef88: i believe is for old jquery versions
23:19  poppiez: sean`: but then I get the mouse coordinates relative to the document and not the relatively positioned div

23:20  sean`: wtf?
23:20  poppiez: sean`: yeah that's what I want
23:20  randomOfAmber: shouldn't this work? http://codepad.org/IHz4RZVC I can't see a major difference between it and the example here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio
23:20  poppiez: sean`: but the inner div has left:0; so it doesn't work
23:20  Nepherius: ...so been reading about jquery for 30 mins now , so if i want to post the result after hiting submit on the same page i have to do something like $("button").load(function () {}); ?
23:20  sean`: poppiez, bs
23:20  sean`: you know that .offset ().left < e.pageX
23:21  Vorspire: (Nepherius): $('button').click

23:21  serio: .unbind maybe?
23:21  sean`: Vorspire, wtf is up with the parentesis
23:21  danheberden: unclickn't
23:21  sean`: serio, there is no unclick
23:21  poppiez: sean`: if the div has left:0; in the CSS, offset().left will always return 0
23:21  Vorspire: what does it matter?
23:21  sean`: danheberden, UNCLICKN'T
23:21 +dabear_: serio: use unbind. unclick was removed in jquery 1.0

23:21  serio: it wasn't me that was asking
23:21  serio: lol
23:21  tainted: Vorspire what is that 'return $(this).each(...)' bit
23:21  serio: zef88, type ?.unclick like 4 times
23:21  serio: *typed*
23:21  Nepherius: Vorspire: you said .load first time..

23:22  npup: I'm checking out QUnit, and wonder how the "Missing tests" feature is used. Anyone here that can explain it a bit?
23:22  zef88: sorry
23:22  zef88: serio said to type it 4 times
23:22  serio: lol
23:22  ajpiano: holy crap
23:22  tainted: so should i do return this.each(...)
23:22  zef88: how isnt there any documentation about deprecated functions?
23:22  Vorspire: (zef88): do us a favor: /query bot-t
23:22  sean`: wtf
23:22  serio: because they're deprecated?
23:23  zef88: yes but php documentation
23:23  zef88: still keeps documentation
23:23  paul_irish: SO deprecated.
23:23  Nepherius: anyway so .click , now i need to put this code in some sort of js script or i just put next to the html stuff ?:D
23:23  danheberden: good for them
23:23  zef88: with a big note saying they are deprecated
23:23  danheberden: so
23:23  danheberden: its not there anymore, THAT should be a huge hint
23:23  poppiez: sean`: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/07/identifying-locating-mouse-position-in.html - if #someDiv was inside a container in the middle of the page and had left:0; this technique wouldn't work, which is the problem

23:24  zef88: :P
23:24  zef88: thx
23:24  zef88: so should i use unbind ?
23:24  serio: YES
23:24  serio: .unbind( 'click' )
23:24  tainted: Vorspire sean` so return $(this).each() or return this.each()?
23:25 +dabear_: $.fn.unclick = function(){ return this.unbind("click"); }; :p
23:25  Vorspire: for the sake of 10kb overhead, use this.each lol
23:25  Vorspire: (tainted): it will work either way, it's up to you and the style you choose imo
23:26  icek: Vorspire! Can you help tell me how to get the blue image to float on top of the pagepeel?  heres the simple demo www.hathol.com/test/test2.php
23:26  Hoe``: is there anyway to make slideDown set it to inline-block, not block?
23:27  Vorspire: (icek): you can try changing the z-index, or swapping them?
23:27 +dabear_: Hoe``: use a custom .animation , or use the finished callback to slidedown
23:27 +dabear_: and set it manually
23:27  npup: (Trying again): I'm checking out QUnit, and wonder how the "Missing tests" feature is used. Anyone here that can explain it a bit?
23:28  npup: No "missing tests" are detected out of the box that I can see at least
23:28  Hoe``: i figured the call back would make it act weird -- slide down as a block then drop in size, guess i'll go custom
23:28  icek: Vorspire i tried
23:29  icek: i dont know what you mean exactly though
23:29  icek: i tried thou
23:29  zef88: thanks
23:30  tainted: Vorspire i need the plugin to intercept the default action
23:30  tainted: Vorspire the $this.each() seems to allow that thru..
23:30  Vorspire: event.preventDefault();
23:30  npup: Ok take care folks
23:31  tainted: Vorspire which function would i pass the event parameter in?
23:31  Vorspire: go that pastebin link?
23:33  tainted: Vorspire http://pastebin.com/bL9sE3Yg
23:33  Hierofant: Hey guys.  I'm setting the height of an image and its two wrappers via height().  After I set them, I try to get them, but they report the original image's pixel dimensions on disk.  I tried css("height") and got the same thing.  In the markup, the script is clearly inserting element sizes properly.  But I can't "get" them.  Any ideas why?
23:34  Vorspire: (tainted): http://pastebin.com/Ah7cUbKV
23:35  tainted: vorspire i mean the plugin is called on an <a>'s onlick()
23:35  Vorspire: is it? can you give me an example?
23:36  tainted: <a onclick="return $('#remove_filter').modalConfirm({confirmId:'#rf_confirm',cancelId:'#rf_cancel',confirmUrl:this.href});" href="abcd.com">test</a>
23:37  tainted: basically it intercepts the href and shows a modal with confirm and cancel buttons
23:37  Vorspire: youch, not the best way to do it
23:37  Vorspire: you should pre-define the script instead of making it in-line with the link
23:37  tainted: ah ok
23:37  tainted: i can do that too
23:39  SugaSlide: lol anyone noticed how all support mails to paypal... they keep refering you till you give up?
23:40  Hierofant: Yes.
23:40  Hierofant: Do not ever use paypal
23:40  Hierofant: It's a frontend for scammers
23:41  funnylookinhat: Is there a way to completely delete an element with jQuery ?
23:41  Hierofant: I have lost $200 on a hotel booking before
23:41  Hierofant: they refused to pay for it
23:41  SugaSlide: we dont have any other option at the moment :(
23:41  Hierofant: and I couldn't find the bastard
23:41  john2496: and they outsource customer support to machine learning algorithms
23:41  SugaSlide: funnylookinhat .remove()
23:41  SugaSlide: bleh
23:42  funnylookinhat: omggggg
23:42  SugaSlide: paypal sucks :(
23:42  SugaSlide: we have another company similer to them here in SA...
23:42  SugaSlide: they took 4 days to get back to me
23:43  tainted: Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/Qpw97K7X
23:43  SugaSlide: and it was a shitty response aswell :(
23:43  SugaSlide: money people blow :(
23:49  Vorspire: (tainted): taking a look
23:50  Hierofant: Heh.  I got scammed by Paypal leech about 3 years ago.  I now live in same city.  I went back thru my records, and found his #.  From this I found his gay nude modeling and hooker website.
23:51  ner0x: Is there a way to make sure that a radio button is always selected at first?
23:51  ner0x: Even if firefox decided to "remember" their last saved check.
23:52  Dykotomee: ner0x: $(function() { $('#propaRB').attr('checked', 'checked'); });
23:53  ner0x: I'll try it. But I don't think that works.
23:53  Dykotomee: Or .trigger('click') might work too.
23:53  evilgeenius: I add a function to class objects like so : "$(".delete_question").click(function() { "  , but then via ajax i load more elements with the "delete_question" class.  What is the best way to re-apply the function to the new elements?
23:53  Dykotomee: ner0x: Works for me, I just implemented it yesterday. :)
23:54  TempTime: Can anyone tell me why when I have http://pastebin.com/Gb5L8vwq and click on one of the three buttons it displays my alert popup twice.
23:54  Dykotomee: evilgeenius: .live?
23:54  evilgeenius: Can I just run "$(".delete_question").click(function() { " again?  what will happen to existing .delete_question elements that have already had an event attached?
23:55  ner0x: Dykotomee: Yep, doesn't work.
23:55  evilgeenius: Dykotomee: sorry, .live?
23:55  soee: is it safe to install proposed updates ?
23:55  tainted: Vorspire any luck?
23:55  Dykotomee: evilgeenius: $('.delete_question').live('click', funcName);

23:56  Dykotomee: ner0x: Try a test page.
23:56  ner0x: Dykotomee: I did.
23:56  Dykotomee: As in, build a simple page w/2 RBs with the same name, submitting to the same page.
23:57  Dykotomee: Then, insert the docReady script that "clicks" the one RB on load.
