13:19  DrSean: but run that console line and see whats up

13:46  SugaSlide: lol
13:46  temp01: and stop with the spam in #jquery
13:46  Hopsy: okay
13:46  Hopsy: sowwy
13:46  temp01: okay.
13:46  SugaSlide: BAN!!!!!!
13:46  temp01: you?
13:46  Hopsy: Noowwwhh
13:47  Seivan|mbp: hmm
13:47  Seivan|mbp: Was hoping to do this without a plugin.
13:47  Seivan|mbp: 1)Something gets prepended to body, execute code on that selector.
13:47  SugaSlide: look how the plugin does it
13:47  temp01: Seivan|mbp: execute your code after appending?
13:47  SugaSlide: hmm
13:47  SugaSlide: ye?
13:48  Seivan|mbp: temp01: on the selector? That doesn't work unless you call live.
13:48  Hopsy: oepz
13:48  Hopsy: http://bot-t.com/factoids/
13:48  Hopsy: lol
13:48  SugaSlide: no
13:48  sean`: Seivan|mbp, live doesn't execute code
13:48  Hopsy: i added too much rulez
13:48  sean`: it's for event delegation
13:48  temp01: Seivan|mbp: it does if you use the selector after appending
13:48  kevinB: Anyone ever had this behaviour with JQuery ????
13:48  kevinB: Remove exec only the 2nd call
13:48  Seivan|mbp: lemme show you code
13:48  SugaSlide: $("#selector").append("<new div>"); $("new div").load()
13:48  sean`: kevinB, read what I said
13:48  Seivan|mbp: http://gist.github.com/629711
13:49  sean`: SugaSlide, wtf?
13:49  SugaSlide: :P
13:49  SugaSlide: i got lazy ok
13:49  sean`: var div = $('<div />').appendTo ('selector').load (.. )
13:49  Seivan|mbp: temp01: SugaSlide can you call methods on selectors that got added dynamically.
13:49  SugaSlide: after they were added... yes
13:49  temp01: yes, if you call those methods and select elements after you add the elements
13:49  sean`: Seivan|mbp, see my example
13:50  SugaSlide: siiigh :(
13:50  SugaSlide: sean` >>>>>>>>> suga
13:50  Seivan|mbp: I want to execute the lightbox function
13:50  Seivan|mbp: does load(..) take a method?
13:50  Hopsy: ?no u
13:50  bot-t: .not(function): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/#not1
13:50  sean`: rtfm
13:50  Hopsy: ?No u
13:50  bot-t: .not(function): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/#not1
13:50  Hopsy: huh
13:50  Hopsy: weird
13:50  SugaSlide: lol
13:51  SugaSlide: botsy :P
13:52  Seivan|mbp: I am trying to do this; http://gist.github.com/629713
13:52  Seivan|mbp: Except my section.modal gets added dynamically.
13:53  Seivan|mbp: so I am looking for something else then "click"
13:53  temp01: call that code after it gets created
13:53  mlechner: hi, what is the right command to "remove" a formerly appended div? I add a div to a jQUery-Object using "jQuery(this).append(foo);" and want to remove it again later on.
13:53  kevinB: .remove()
13:53  kevinB: haha
13:54  kevinB: Hope it works for you
13:54  kevinB: otherwise
13:54  Seivan|mbp: temp01: what method do I use that to call the function on the selecotor?
13:54  kevinB: "JUST CHANGE THE CODE" sean said
13:54  Seivan|mbp: ?
13:54  temp01: Seivan|mbp: what is appending the section.modal div
13:54  Seivan|mbp: a server request
13:55  temp01: then call that code after the server request is done and the element is done
13:55  temp01: ajax requests usually have callbacks, use it.
13:55  Seivan|mbp: .. eh
13:55  Seivan|mbp: Is there a method in jquery to execute a function on a selector, like "clicK" but without having the user to click
13:56  Seivan|mbp: Thats what I am looking for.
13:56  SugaSlide: .trigger("click")
13:56  SugaSlide: ?
13:56  SugaSlide: lol
13:56  Seivan|mbp: what?
13:56  bot-t: You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
13:57  Seivan|mbp: What I am looking to do is to execute a function on a selector. That is all.
13:57  Seivan|mbp: there is .click, I want .execute
13:57  Seivan|mbp: (pseudo code)
13:57  temp01: ?each
13:57  bot-t: .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
13:57  mlechner: kevinB: tried it yesterday - remove() didn't work - now i found the reason - of course it works like that. thnx
13:58  kevinB: mlechner : so what was the reason?
13:59  sean`: Seivan|mbp, add a class to the element
13:59  sean`: and then select on that
14:00  Seivan|mbp: uh.. I am not stupid.
14:00  Seivan|mbp: http://gist.github.com/629720
14:00  Seivan|mbp: This is what I did
14:00  Seivan|mbp: But it feels like a hack.
14:00  Seivan|mbp: Is there a work around.
14:00  Hopsy: ?-christel-
14:00  bot-t: bla bla bla bla bla, I'm -christel-!
14:00  Hopsy: who is this lol
14:01  SugaSlide: bots cheating on you :P
14:01  Hopsy: lol
14:01  temp01: Seivan|mbp: you want each()
14:01  Seivan|mbp: why?
14:01  Seivan|mbp: Why do I need to loop up
14:01 --- LunaVorax_ is now known as LunaVorax
14:02  temp01: if you want to run a normal  function (not a jquery method) on multiple elements, you need to loop manually
14:02  sean`: zomg
14:02  sean`: retarded people
14:02  mlechner: kevinB: just a typo in remove('foooo') - then i tried using the id or the class - after that i tried using erase() - your prompt statement made me looking again to the remove('foo')
14:04  kevinB: sean get your coffee and stop spread your bad humor thanks
14:05  sean`: grow a brain
14:06  Seivan|mbp: temp01:  How do I run a normal function on a selector?
14:06  kevinB: yea that s a good idea too cheers
14:06  temp01: Seivan|mbp: .each
14:06  nlogax: very carefully?
14:06  Seivan|mbp: selector.each {($(this).lightbox_me{....}}
14:07  Seivan|mbp: christ, all I want to do is execute a function on a selector
14:07  temp01:  $('selector').each(function(){ <code here> })
14:07  nlogax: what does that even mean? a selector is just a string, in jquery
14:07  nlogax: foo("hello")
14:07  Seivan|mbp: http://gist.github.com/629724
14:07  Seivan|mbp: temp01: thanks gonna try it.
14:09  SugaSlide: Shake of your dicks this pissing contest is over!!
14:09  Seivan|mbp: $("section.modal").each(function({alert("hahah")}); gives me an error. http://109.228.150.197:3001/7F941/Screenshot_10/16/10_2:09_PM
14:09  Hopsy: SugaSlide!! WHUTT!!
14:10  Seivan|mbp: SyntaxError: Parse Error under <html lang="en">
14:10  nlogax: gotta write valid js. function({alert("hahah")} makes little sense
14:10  sean`: harhar
14:11  Seivan|mbp: nlogax: Okay, but is exactly how temp01wrote it.
14:11  nlogax: no
14:11  Seivan|mbp: ehm
14:11  Seivan|mbp: What is wrong with it then?
14:12  Seivan|mbp: I just wanna see if the code executes
14:12  Hopsy: missing function name
14:12  Hopsy: ?
14:12  sean`: ?eval (function () { return 'don\'t need no name to be koole'; })()
14:12  bot-t: sean`: don't need no name to be koole
14:12  nlogax: your function has no function body, Seivan|mbp.
14:12  nlogax: and the arg is all weird
14:12  Seivan|mbp: each(function(index) {
14:13  Hopsy: ?eval something('Hopsy'); function something(value) { return value; }
14:13  bot-t: Hopsy: Hopsy
14:13  SugaSlide: each(function() { alert("aa")
14:13  Hopsy: sean`: why do you need that () ?
14:13  Hopsy: at the end of your line
14:14  nlogax: to call the function
14:14  sean`: Hopsy, want me to blog about it?
14:14  Hopsy: yeah
14:14  sean`: I'll write on up in a moment
14:14  SugaSlide: lol
14:14  sean`: either wa.. you run the function immediately
14:14  sean`: it's like var foo = function () {  };
14:14  sean`: and you do foo ();
14:15  sean`: now you just execute the functino directly
14:15  Hopsy: hmm
14:15  Seivan|mbp: yeah it works now
14:15  Seivan|mbp: Thanks!
14:15  Hopsy: ?eval (function (something) { return something; })('Haaii')
14:15  bot-t: Hopsy: Haaii
14:15  Hopsy: ah I get it
14:15  nlogax: functino!
14:15  SugaSlide: FINALY
14:16  SugaSlide: sounds italian
14:16  Hopsy: ?translate functino
14:16  bot-t: Hopsy, Translation (English -> English) - functino
14:16  nlogax: función
14:16  sean`: http://jquerymobile.com/2010/10/jquery-mobile-alpha-1-released/

14:56  Titosemi: hey guys could you recommend me a form validation plugin??? i need it to add a class to the field on exist or error and perform a callback function
14:56  sean`: ?validate @ Titosemi
14:56  bot-t: Titosemi, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
14:57  Titosemi: thanks sean`
15:19  r3x: heyokay
15:19  zim: Hi all. if I have <div class="foobar"><div>do somthing with this div</div></div> $('foobar').click(function (){ $(this)here is my Q    }); How do I target the div inside of (this) div?
15:20  r3x: rs
15:20  r3x: i meant okay
15:20  r3x: sean`:
15:20  r3x: this is ridiculous
15:20  r3x: and i was getting my head arround this
15:20  SugaSlide: lol
15:20  r3x: u know what the problem is with jquery
15:20  r3x: look:
15:20  SugaSlide: $(this).find(
15:20  r3x: http://r3x.eu/jquery.html
15:21  r3x: on firefox
15:21  zim: SugaSlide: was that for me?
15:21  r3x: Warning: Unknown pseudo-class or pseudo-element 'sizzle'.
15:21  SugaSlide: yips

15:21  r3x: Line: 0
15:21  zim: thanks
15:21  SugaSlide: r3x im not getting it
15:21  r3x: SugaSlide:
15:21  SugaSlide: disable your extentions
15:22  r3x: this page all it does it calls jquery
15:22  r3x: from http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
15:22  SugaSlide: LOL
15:22  Hopsy: SugaSlide: sorry
15:22  SugaSlide: dont link to it there
15:22  Hopsy: I HAD BLUESCREENNNN
15:22  SugaSlide: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
15:22  SugaSlide: well change 1.4.2 to the latest
15:23  Hopsy: it was not a good idea to do that access thing
15:23  SugaSlide: haha
15:23  SugaSlide: what did you break?
15:23  r3x: SugaSlide: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/latest/jquery.min.js
15:23  SugaSlide: r3x http://gyazo.com/8758eceeff11c1789e140e1dc1014980.png
15:23  r3x: doesnt work
15:23  SugaSlide: um
15:24  SugaSlide: exact model dude
15:24  SugaSlide: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js
15:24  r3x: SugaSlide: i cannot see ur webdeveloper icons
15:24  schone: hi all, just wanting to get some advice on creating a json object. i want to create a json object from a <ul></ul> element, has anyone got any suggestions or plugins that make this easier?
15:24  SugaSlide: dont use "latest" in production
15:24  r3x: cause mine return an error
15:24  r3x: SugaSlide: but that is wrong
15:25  r3x: cause even i created a server side script just to embed the latest jquery
15:25  r3x: to work even on ssl
15:25  SugaSlide: http://gyazo.com/267eb0feec6ae21e629b577e4b91f6a4.png
15:25  SugaSlide: better?
15:25  r3x: (cause jquery certificate is not even valid)
15:25  SugaSlide: r3x...
15:25  Seivan|mbp: Anyone know of a JS library or Jquery plugin that focuses on modifying content on select/option tags? I want to remove past days and past months, but if the user picks another month or year I can show past months
15:25  SugaSlide: using the "latest" might break things
15:25  Evet: which plugin you suggest to make all pages ajax loaded. like new twitter
15:25  Seivan|mbp: I want to remove past dates relative to Date.todays date.
15:25  SugaSlide: when you dev you dev for a specific "number"
15:25  r3x: SugaSlide: the point was having always the latest version
15:26  r3x: like changing a gazzilion sites everytime the version changes?
15:26  SugaSlide: look at what happened from 1.3.# to 1.4.#
15:26  SugaSlide: ALOT of stuff got broken
15:26  r3x: SugaSlide: yes i know
15:26  r3x: but thats the point
15:26  SugaSlide: we still have suers coming in "cant update to 1.4.# since the site was developed for 1.3 and 1.4 breaks it
15:26  JMather: but 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 shouldn't break nearly as much
15:26  SugaSlide: yeah
15:26  SugaSlide: nothing breaks 1.4.2 to 1.4.3
15:27  SugaSlide: but...
15:27  SugaSlide: what happemns when 1.5 comes out?
15:27  Hopsy: SugaSlide: can i show you something? =o
15:27  SugaSlide: latest will pull 1.5
15:27  SugaSlide: shoot
15:27  SugaSlide: so just use http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js
15:28  JMather: I always host locally so I can combine into one JS call
15:28  r3x: ahh
15:28  r3x: so thats the problem i didnt know it had changed
15:29  r3x: so whats wrong with v 1.4.3?
15:29  r3x: cause im getting that "sizzle" error
15:29  r3x: look
15:29  r3x: http://r3x.eu/jquery.html
15:29  SugaSlide: im not getting that error
15:30  SugaSlide: so must be something your side
15:30  SugaSlide: disable your ff extentions
15:30  nlogax: no error here
15:30  berttrand: nor here
15:30  r3x: SugaSlide: http://r3x.eu/Screenshot.png
15:30  nlogax: errorn't in firefox, chrome and safari
15:30  berttrand: FF3.6.10
15:30  temp01: it's a warning not an error
15:31  r3x: yes warning
15:31  berttrand: no warnings either
15:31  temp01: normal
15:31  r3x: hmmm
15:31  temp01: you have to enable it afaik
15:31  temp01: it's not enabled by default to show those stupid warnings
15:32  temp01: "afaik"
15:32  berttrand: show java script warnings?
15:33  r3x: thats weirg
15:33  r3x: weird*

15:34  SugaSlide: http://gyazo.com/3696907fc8088cab515a6d1ee5ed0e3b.png
15:34  r3x: colorzilla firebug google toolbar, web developer
15:34  miket3: i have a jquery ui dialog that displays a table of images.  I am looking to see if there is a way to cache that so it doesnt need to be re-loaded each time my page is refreshed...
15:34  r3x: and ubuntu firefox modifications, maybe that is it
15:35  r3x: ah
15:35  SugaSlide: r2x check screen grab
15:35  temp01: r3x: it doesn't really matter. those warning are for debugging and are harmless
15:35  temp01: warnings
15:35  SugaSlide: thats what it "should" be mebbe
15:35  r3x: yeah i know (but they are "ugly") bad warning!
15:35  r3x: :P
15:36  r3x: suppose ill have to live with it
15:36  nlogax: i get warnings just by starting firefox
15:36  temp01: ;D
15:36  SugaSlide: *in a temp voice* use chrome
15:36  nlogax: i do
15:36  temp01: SugaSlide++
15:36  nlogax: you made me start it!!
15:36  r3x: rs
15:37  r3x: well the thing is i use all those
15:37  SugaSlide: firebug is just so nice and compact :(
15:37  r3x: including opera and epiphany
15:37  nlogax: ?muu
15:37  bot-t: much unlike urself
15:37  r3x: :P
15:37  r3x: but! the point is
15:37  r3x: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
15:37  r3x: with this one
15:37  r3x: it doesnt happen
15:37  r3x: http://r3x.eu/jquery.html
15:37  SugaSlide: as far as i know... they disabled direct linking
15:38  r3x: it works fine
15:38  SugaSlide: to jquery.com js'
15:38  SugaSlide: they have extra scripts running for people that hot link
15:38  SugaSlide: hence why i said sue the google 1
15:38  nlogax: r3x: that particular thing is in a try {}
15:38  SugaSlide: but noooooooooooo dont listen to the suga
15:38  SugaSlide: :P
15:38  r3x: ahah
15:38  nlogax: r3x: so it's done specifically to check for an error
15:39  r3x: ok then
15:39  nlogax: firefox doesn't error, but issues a warning
15:40  r3x: thanks a bunch
15:40  r3x: anyway
15:40  r3x: :P
15:40  r3x: bad jquery!

17:00  JD-Robbs: Hi everyone... Some customers are having problems playing some MP3's for demos of my work. Now, I have about 400 dewplayers (flashplayers) on various pages... They go along the lines of standard html tags <object>Myplayer<flashvars vars="asdf.mp3"></flashvars></object>... Is there a way, with jQuery, to go through all of these object-tags and replace them with a link pointing to the url of...
17:00  JD-Robbs: ...the mp3 in case there is no flash installed?
17:00  JD-Robbs: Tremendous kudos for any kind of help, cheers :)
17:01  miketaylr: does $('flashvars').length return anythign?
17:01  miketaylr: no idea if jquery can grab those guys
17:02  sean`: JD-Robbs, yes, that would be possible
17:02  sean`: but, isn't it better to just generate a <noscript> ?
17:02  sean`: serverside*
17:03 --- Zefster_ is now known as Zefster
17:03  JD-Robbs: miketaylr: Cheers, first of all I am on the case right now ;)
17:03  JD-Robbs: sean`: Thing is, I cannot check if flash is installed on the server, or am I wrong ther? :D
17:03  sean`: lal
17:03  sean`: ignore me
17:03  sean`: <noscript> is for js
17:03  sean`: not for flash
17:04  JD-Robbs: I know that, I thought you had a freudian slip and thought I was talking about javascript and not flash
17:04  sean`: miketaylr, flashvars isn't a tag
17:04  JD-Robbs: Sorry, params not flashvars
17:04  miketaylr: sean`: i have no idea...just going off his example
17:05  JD-Robbs: Mea culpa, "params" not "flashvars" ;)
17:05  sean`: JD-Robbs, if you want to do that, you could simply do: $('object').each (function () {  $(this).after ('shit, no flash click here' + this.data-mp3-link) });
17:05  sean`: summin like that
17:05  sean`: new jQ143 supports flash data :D so that's cool
17:05  progrock: how do I get the windows current display height?
17:06  JohnMiller: Hello, i've got some newbie question, why does the tutorial uses the event parameter http://pastebin.com/uWHHcxsR in this example?
17:07  JohnMiller: and followed by that, how i know that the "event" object exists, i think it is connected to all links ("a")
17:07  sean`: JohnMiller, I reckon semantics
17:07  JD-Robbs: sean`: On it right now, cheers buddy! :)
17:07  sean`: JohnMiller, every event will pass an event argument
17:07  sean`: ?mdc addEventListener @ JD-Robbs
17:07  bot-t: JD-Robbs, element.addEventListener - addEventListener registers a single event listener on a single target. The event target may be a single node in a document, the document itself, a window , or an XMLHttpRequest . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
17:07  sean`: I ment JohnMiller ^^
17:08  shal3r: can i track somehow what adds height:0px to some elements? I can't find anything in code about that, but height adds.
17:08  berttrand: progrock: height of the viewport? $(window).height()
17:09  JohnMiller: alright, so jquery adds internally event listers to all my dom elements which i use
17:09  JohnMiller: ?
17:10  JohnMiller: and the parameter ist for using them (preventing default behavior or so .)
