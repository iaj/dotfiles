00:02  tainted: Vorspire i included an usage example that's not in-line
00:02  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/rPbNe/
00:03 +dabear_: TempTime: nah, let me see a demo.
00:03 +dabear_: ?demo @ TempTime
00:03  bot-t: TempTime, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
00:03  danheberden: TempTime http://pastebin.com/xRfyELCH
00:03  Vorspire: (tainted): http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/rPbNe/
00:03  tainted: Vorspire can i alter that in realtime?
00:04  evilgeenius: Dykotomee: can any function be applied with live? e.g. "overlay" from jquery ui tools?
00:04  Dykotomee: evilgeenius: I don't see why not.
00:04  SugaSlide: evilgeenius only events
00:04  Vorspire: (tainted): yes, but refresh it now
00:04  SugaSlide: .live is only events
00:04  Dykotomee: SugaSlide: No, you bind functions to events.
00:05  Vorspire: (tainted): just hit "Fork"
00:05  danheberden: TempTime: nvm, that's inaccurage
00:05  danheberden: simply put, you'te initializating two buttonsets
00:05  evilgeenius: Dykotomee:  so could "$(".trigger").overlay({ " be used as "$('.trigger').live("overlay", ..."  ?
00:05  Dykotomee: SugaSlide: e.g.: $('.links').live('click', anyFunctionIWantHere);
00:05  danheberden: so just do .buttonset().click() - on one line
00:05  SugaSlide: ye that will work
00:05  Dykotomee: evilgeenius: No.
00:05  SugaSlide: lol
00:06  Dykotomee: wait..
00:06  Dykotomee: ..is overlay an event?
00:06  SugaSlide: my "work" part was at Dykotomee
00:06  SugaSlide: dont think so
00:06  Dykotomee: lol
00:06  Dykotomee: Oh OK.
00:06  SugaSlide: hence mentioning that its events only :P
00:06  Dykotomee: Yeah, evilgeenius, that won't work.
00:06  Dykotomee: First param is event.
00:07  evilgeenius: Dykotomee: is there anyway to make it work?
00:07  Dykotomee: Second param is unlimited, any function.
00:07  Dykotomee: evilgeenius: I have no idea what "overlay" does, so...
00:07  SugaSlide: evilgeenius theres a plugin that does what live does
00:07  chewbranca: anyone using flowplayer tools know how to dynamically create an overlay? ie $("<div><p>Some overlay text</p></div>").overlay();
00:07  Vorspire: ?overlay
00:07  bot-t: Vorspire, Windows and Overlays - AJAX-ZOOM is a powerful image zoom & pan gallery plugin based on jQuery and PHP. It features over 250 options and can be easily integrated into any website, CMS or webshop. http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?type=43
00:07  SugaSlide: but can be bound to anything
00:07  SugaSlide: livewuery
00:07  SugaSlide: livequery*
00:08  Dykotomee: ?livequery
00:08  bot-t: Dykotomee, Live Query | jQuery Plugins - Live Query (formerly Behavior) utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM upda... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery
00:08  Dykotomee: Ummm...isn't that just .live()?
00:08  evilgeenius: SugaSlide: have you tried it? is it good?
00:08  Dykotomee: Or isn't .live() in the core?
00:08  SugaSlide: lol
00:08  SugaSlide: .live = events only
00:09  SugaSlide: .livewuery = events and other things
00:09  SugaSlide: like
00:09  chewbranca: Dykotomee: at least in 1.3.x .live would only work with events whereas livequery would let you run arbitrary functions on new elements
00:09  SugaSlide: .livequery(function(){ $(this).show(); })
00:09  Dykotomee: So missing the difference...
00:09  Dykotomee: (emphasis on the "So")
00:09  chewbranca: you can't run what SugaSlide just said with .live()
00:10  Dykotomee: chewbranca: Well, no, there's no event to bind it to.
00:10  sothisisit: what effect should I use if I need to animate the position of a div upwards?
00:10  SugaSlide: thats where livequery comes in
00:10  chewbranca: Dykotomee: that's the point
00:10  Dykotomee: I have no idea what livequery is being bound to.
00:10  SugaSlide: doesnt NEED an event to run
00:10  Dykotomee: Or what it is binding.
00:10  Dykotomee: Oh, so it runs functions when elements are created?
00:11  chewbranca: Dykotomee: yeap
00:11  tainted: Vorspire ok, but that no longer returns the $(this).each(...)
00:11  Dykotomee: Wow, that's crazy.
00:11  Dykotomee: And probably expensive.
00:11  SugaSlide: wtf
00:11  Vorspire: (tainted): yes, because the plugin is initiated like a normal function, whereby you already have done the selection, which will be the parent of .click
00:12  JoelE: Hey! I am using addClass() function to add a class to a DIV. However, after creating a class that way, say "myClass" and I later try to use $('.myClass') it seems like it is not part of the DOM because nothing happens...
00:12  TempTime: danheberden: my jQuery or Jquery UI must be messed up.  It works fine on jsfiddler and does it double on my local machine...off to redownload I guess
00:12  chewbranca: Dykotomee: yes it is, if I remember correctly they just reparse the dom every 100ms or so and check for new elements
00:12  SugaSlide: paypal sandbox.. theres a reset button to reset the password of the test accounts when you auto create them... but then you cant reset auto created accounts... only manual 1's... yet if you manualy create an account.. theres no reset button
00:13  ajpiano: ?faq events @ JoelE
00:13  bot-t: JoelE, FAQ: Why do my events stop working after an AJAX request? - http://tr.im/jqfaq2_1
00:14  Vorspire: (tainted): i'll modify it so you only need to call $('a').modalConfirm (which will bind .click to $('a') by default )
00:15  sothisisit: guys got a second?
00:15  JoelE: thnx
00:16  l4rk: ?second

00:16  sothisisit: Imagine I have a div with overflow hidden, inside that div there's another div with margin top 500px so that you can see just a bit of it, and a trigger element to slide that div upwards. What effect should i use to do that?
00:16  macmartine: I create an element but haven't added it to the dom yet, like var ul = document.createElement('ul'); -- how can i append another element to that?
00:16  l4rk: macmartine: by using jquery
00:16  macmartine: example?
00:16  l4rk: $("<ul/>").append
00:17 --- snover is now known as snover|workish
00:17  l4rk: .append("<li/>")
00:18  sothisisit: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/JS7DF/
00:18  macmartine: right, but what am I appending it to? i don't have a handle of  the dom object yet since i haven't added ul to the dom. if i try ul.append('<li/>') it says append() is not a method
00:19  l4rk: macmartine: because you aren't using jquery to create the element
00:19  l4rk: did you even try the example i gave you?
00:19  chewbranca: so yeah, anyone know how to dynamically create a flowplayer tools overlay?
00:19  l4rk: createElement creates a dom object, jQuery creates a jQuery object collection
00:19  l4rk: you could use appendChild
00:19  l4rk: but then why are you asking here....
00:25  macmartine: l4rk:  got it, thanks
00:25  l4rk: npo
00:27  macmartine: i see you can add a css property to a new element like this: $('<a></a>').css('color', 'red') -- but how would you add a non-css property such as 'href' in the same manner?
00:29  macmartine: attr() -- nevermind
00:33  sothisisit: I did it on my own ! http://jsfiddle.net/JS7DF/
00:34  temp01: you should use $('<a>') or $('<a/>') not $('<a></a>')
00:37  sothisisit: Did it again
00:37  sothisisit: is there a more elegant way (shorter code) to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/JS7DF/
00:37  stalski1: what is the general known best sollution to create dynamic functions , meaning string functions ?
00:37  sothisisit: oops wrong link
00:37  sothisisit: http://jsfiddle.net/JS7DF/1/
00:39  temp01: hmm, n/m what I said above
00:40  evilgeenius: SugaSlide: cheers, livequery is awesome
00:41  SugaSlide: ye
00:43  sothisisit: temp01: can you take a look pls?
00:46 --- ezra-g is now known as ezra-g|af_tothe_

00:46  temp01: hovering-out slideup (moving mouse to right or top) doesn't hide it
00:47  sothisisit: nice
00:47  sothisisit: didn't know about that
00:47  temp01: in mouseleave(), you can use $(this)
00:48  sothisisit: instead of repeating myself right?
00:48  temp01: right, and reselecting stuff
00:48  temp01: and making the code non-portable
00:49  temp01: (multiple .hidden divs)
00:49  sothisisit: sounds fair to me
00:49  Dykotomee: Any way to get the calculated color of an element?
00:49  sothisisit: what do you mean by non-portable?
00:50  sothisisit: I have the feeling the code could be shorter, but don't know how to
00:52  Vorspire: tainted: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/rPbNe/
00:56  devinrolsen: You know when you are setting up your plugin's options, someOption: true,  would there be a way to set it to be true or false while also setting up nested options for this particular option? Like: someOption:true, {someNestedOption:false}?
00:58  Vorspire: (devinrolsen): just check the options like: if( options )
00:59  devinrolsen: hmmm I think I need a real world example, one sec

01:05  Vorspire: (devinrolsen): http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/V4zPC/1/
01:06  devinrolsen: yeah, but these are default, so someOption will always exist you see
01:06  devinrolsen: thus the need for true or false to be my conditioner
01:06  Vorspire: everything returns true or false
01:06  Vorspire: everything
01:06  Vorspire: in an if statement
01:06  Vorspire: if can only be true or false
01:07  Vorspire: like if ( 1 == 1 ) //is true
01:07  Vorspire: no matter what you put in it
01:07  Vorspire: but i see what you're trying to do
01:07  devinrolsen: yars I get it now
01:08  devinrolsen: just wanted to cut down on an extra option of enable
01:08  devinrolsen: think that will work
01:08  devinrolsen: thanks man

12:43  hyperstream: Hello, im wondering how i would go about this, of if there is a plugin i can use: I have 5 divs, each with z-index's, ranging from 0-4, when i click on any given one, im looking to have it go to the top and all the rest fall down below it
12:51  mlechner: hyperstream: haven't tried this with z-index: use 2 different classes and removeClass().addClass() to change z-index of your div?
12:52  hyperstream: the amount of div's i would have is unknown, thing is, the old top would need to sit right under the new top, and the second to last one on top would become the third and so forth down the chain
12:53  mlechner: hyperstream: o.k i thought you just have to bring one to the foreground and all the rest somehow to the bg
12:53  hyperstream: yeah sorry about that, kinda hard to explain, been trying to google stacking divs and elements etc, with no luck
12:53 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
12:55  mlechner: hyperstream: so you need to decrease the z-index of each div with a z-index-value higher than the clicked one and give the clicked div a z-index of tha number of divs?
12:57  hyperstream: the default order is: 0 1 2 3 4 5, if i click on div with z-index of 2, i need to push that to position 5, while the original 5 becomes 4, 4-3, 3-2, 2-1, 1-0
12:57  hyperstream: The way im counting the divs, is (".class").length-1;
12:58  hyperstream: I using .each to cycle through them
13:00  mlechner: hyperstream: you don't have to change the divs 2-1 (because this is your clicked one), 1 and 0
13:00  hyperstream: Yes that right, my bad
13:01  hyperstream: bugger this, im way to tired, to many hours on it, clear my head and try again tomorrow i think
13:01  mlechner: try a simple for loop - tomorrow ;-)
13:02  hyperstream: yeah, ive been through 5+ loop systems, using + and minus etc ive over thought it all lol
13:02  hyperstream: fresh again tomra, thanks bud

16:10  hmd: Guys, can someone clarify how live events work?
16:11  hmd: I want to attach as a document loads, a live "load" even on images, to replace the images as soon as they load.
16:11  hmd: does that sound like it'd work well
16:20  renat: ?live

16:22  paul_uk: wow this is annoying, if i have focusout with a textbox and then i click a button, the focusout fires first and then the click event of the button.
16:22  paul_uk: i wonder how facebook did it with their newsfeed/wall comment box
16:25  hmd: renat, I've read the manual, I want to know how it works under the hood and does anyone have experience with the scenario I noted.
16:27  paul_uk: hmd your question doesn't really make sense to me
16:27  paul_uk: $('.images').live('click',function(e){  to all images which have the class .images
16:28  paul_uk: which have loaded or are created on the fly
16:28  hmd: paul_uk, I want to set a live 'load' event handler on all images.
16:28  hmd: I want to handle load specifically.
16:28  hmd: Does this have known problems?
16:28  paul_uk: i have no experience with load sorry
16:30  hmd: Thanks. So far it doesn't seem to work :P
16:31  hmd: Is there another way I can just automatically get all images once they're loaded, even with some delay
16:37  paul_uk: man i can't seem to solve my problem, but the good thing is that I'm not alone tho.  2 others are experiencing the same issue.
16:48  nvictor: paul_uk: what's the issue?
16:49  paul_uk: nvictor: this question is in 2 parts.
16:49  paul_uk: 1) lets say I have a textarea with a blur event and a button with an onclick event.  if i focus on the textarea and then click the button.  the blur event fires, but the onclick doesn't.
16:49  Evet: how to abort a getJSON call?
16:49  paul_uk: 2) lets say I have a textarea with a focusout event and a button with an onclick event.  if i focus on the textarea and then click the button.  the focusout event fires first, and the onclick fires second.  How to get the onclick to fire first?
16:51  nvictor: well, i'm not sure if that's a jquery issue
16:51  nvictor: paul_uk: do you have the same effect in all the major browsers?
16:51  paul_uk: nvictor: just been trying with FF 3.6 but lemme see chrome
16:51  bonhoffer: what do folks use to prevent content showing then hiding?
16:51  bonhoffer: use/like?
16:52  paul_uk: nvictor, yeah same for chrome.  I don't think its a browser issue
16:52  nvictor: paul_uk: well, it can't be jquery either
16:53  nvictor: paul_uk: i am no expert
16:53  nvictor: but events handling order is defined by browsers
16:53  nvictor: and i have never heard you can change that
16:53  paul_uk: nvictor, no worries.  I'm trying to replicate facebooks comment box on their newsfeed/wall and it works for them.
16:54  nvictor: paul_uk: can you paste your code?
16:54  bonhoffer: i remember seeing a solution for the content/hiding problem that was css based
16:54  bonhoffer: but can't find it
16:54  nvictor: bonhoffer: $.fn.hide ?
16:54  bonhoffer: nvictor: sorry, are you saying there is a jquery solution?
16:54  paul_uk: nvictor, i'm gonna post the q on stackoverflow.  i'll probably get better reponses there :)
16:55  paul_uk: i want to move onto something else, i've spent enough time on the issue :)
16:55  nvictor: well here too
16:55  nvictor: if you can show people what you are doing...
16:55  nvictor: bonhoffer: hiding an element boils down to selecting it and invoking hide()
16:56  bonhoffer: i can hide elements fine, but content shows, then hides

16:58  bonhoffer: nvictor: i am using accordian effect .  . . i'll play with the css to see if i can get that working
16:58  nvictor: bonhoffer: it's not perfect afaik because some browsers need height, zoom, etc...
16:58  nvictor: bonhoffer: i think showing then hiding is not a big deal, users can handle that :)
16:59  bonhoffer: true -- doesn't look so professional, but they can handle it
16:59  bonhoffer: i thought there was a seamless solution i saw before . . .
17:06  cstextiles1: Is there any way by which if i can check if a String endsWith 'App'?

17:28  linelevel: Hi guys. I have a webform which I'm intercepting with a .submit() event so that I can submit the post via ajax. However, my ajax must post to the same URL that's in the form's action attribute, and that URL redirects the user to a different page (via an HTTP 302 redirect). Is there any way that I can perform this $.post() without allowing the the script to redirect the user?
17:29  vskumar: i have 2 j query code.. one is horizontal menu and other is image rotator. the dropdown menu gets hidden behind the image rotator.
17:29  vskumar: can any one help
17:30  sean`: linelevel, that's something you need to deal with serverside
17:30  sean`: what language ar eyou in
17:30  vskumar: html,css
17:32  linelevel: sean`, Python. I'm using Django, and the redirect happens in the post function for the comments system that I'm using (from the Django std library).
17:32  vskumar: i have 2 j query code.. one is horizontal menu and other is image rotator. the dropdown menu gets hidden behind the image rotator. can anyone help me with this
17:32  nvictor: paul_uk: still there?
17:33  linelevel: sean`, I'm trying to ajax-ify the comment system, so a redirect upon successful posting of a comment is antithetical to my purpose.
17:33  sean`: linelevel, detect the call
17:33  paul_uk: nvictor, yeah
17:33  sean`: you can see what kind of a request it is.. xhr sends a header along with it
17:33  nvictor: paul_uk: your so post was removed
17:34  sean`: So you can see if it's an ajax call, and use that to your advantadge (no redirect)
17:34  nvictor: paul_uk: but i found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1429112/issues-with-jquery-blur-and-focus-events
17:34  paul_uk: nvictor, yeah i removed it.  i wanted to be as correct as possible.  i made a mistake.  i will repost in 10 mins
17:35  linelevel: sean`,  I'm somewhat of a jquerry newbie, and I don't quite understand. Can you give me a starting point to figure out how I can detect the call as you're suggesting?
17:35  g0bl1n: I get a different behaviour with this "if (del_res) row.fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).remove(); } );" in Chrome&Safari and Firefox. Firefox removes all the rows. Chrome and Safari remove only the selected row.
17:36  paul_uk: nvictor: thanks, using a timeout.. hmm yeah i guess its a hack lol
17:37  sean`: linelevel, in php it's like this http://blog.seankoole.com/detecting-ajax-calls-php-example
17:37  nvictor: paul_uk: it is because the issue is not a jquery issue :)
17:37  sean`: and linelevel it's not a jquery thing, it's your backend
17:37  nvictor: paul_uk: it's really the browser, but make your post, i want to see what the code is like :)
17:37  paul_uk: nvictor: the code is really simple..  its what you would expect.
17:38  sean`: linelevel, you could also just do a simple if statement, which doesn't trigger the redirect if you send post data
17:38  paul_uk: nvictor: this is the focusout event : $('.replytext').live('focusout',function(e){ console.log ("focusout"); });
17:39  robokop: .msg bot-t paste
17:39  linelevel: sean`, The issue is that the Python script which is run when posting a comment is defined in the standard library, and I don't want to directly edit the std library (that seems like very bad practice to me).
17:40  sean`: well.. linelevel if your architecture doesn't allow overrides, then you're already doing bad things
17:40  fecal: having a brain fart here.  how do you set the selected option in a select box again?
17:40  sean`: however.. I don't think that's the case
17:41  sean`: I think you're too focussed on jQuery, while you should be focussing on python
17:41  EddieRingle: has getJSON been known to mess up the order of the JSON's items?
17:41  sean`: jquery's ajax is an exact copy of the normal browser post.. so the logic in your python script should be the same
17:41  sean`: EddieRingle, no it doesn't
17:41  linelevel: sean`, Alternatively, is there some way that I can "cage" the ajax call so that the redirect won't apply to the page that this script is running on? maybe attach it to a virtual DOM rather than the one that is being displayed to the user? (As I said I'm a newb so I'm just throwing out ideas, not sure if they make good sense)
17:42  sean`: linelevel, you're doing an ajax post to a page right?
17:42  linelevel: yes
17:42  sean`: does the page where the form is in the DOM redirect or the page to where you post?
17:42  EddieRingle: sean`: I use getJSON to fetch JSON from a PHP script, which accesses and sorts data from a server; I verified that the JSON it returns is sorted correctly, but when I build my HTML list using a for in loop, it's not in the correct order
17:42  sean`: ?details @ EddieRingle
17:42  bot-t: EddieRingle, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
17:43  linelevel: sean`, The page I post to does the redirect

17:43  linelevel: sean`, To clarify, the page containing the form is my own, so I can do anything there. The page I'm posting to is defined in the Django std lib.
17:44  linelevel: Okay. I guess that's a no to my caging idea.

17:53  sean`: oh ofcourse
17:53  EddieRingle: ?

19:52  sprezzatura: am using jquery.validate(http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation) and i find that the form gets submitted even when i have errors in my form. http://jsfiddle.net/n2yf4/
19:53  sprezzatura: should it be something like "$("#sign-in-form").validate().submit(function(event){" instead?
19:54  sean`: sprezzatura, there's an invalidHandler and a submitHandler
19:55  sean`: You shouldn't use it incombination with .submit()
19:55  jschoolcraft: I'm using jquery ui's sortable, and trying to use the update: event to eventually call some ajax to make the sort permanent.  for now just trying to alert(ui.position) or ui.offset. but I'm a n00b and ui.position prints object, and ui.position.val() errors, I'm guessing.
19:57  sean`: jschoolcraft, you can serialize the current positions
19:58  sean`: update: function () { var str = $sortable.sortable ('serialize'); localStorage.setItem ('startingposition', str); }
19:58  guy: guys I am still looking for a script like this just that would get results from an AJAX call
19:58  guy: http://d-scribe.de/webtools/jquery-pagination/demo/demo_options.htm
19:58  sean`: Keep asking
20:00  sprezzatura: sean`: where?
20:00  jschoolcraft: sean`: what's it serialized as? I tried $(this).sortable('toArray').toString(); but that seems like a lot of work to iterate through all the items on the backend and update their position
20:00  sprezzatura: sean`: in jquery.validate?
20:00  sean`: sprezzatura, YES
20:00  sean`: What else would I be talking about :p
20:01  sean`: jschoolcraft, see my sample code
20:01  jschoolcraft: tried $(this).sortable('serialize') and tried to alert(str) and it's empty.
20:02  jschoolcraft: sean`: what is localStorage? just an abstraction for whatever backend I have?
20:04  zjwalden: localstorage is the browsers localstorage..
20:04  vladikoff: lolcatstorage

20:05  Doonce: i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/e3ssN/1/ the goto thing takes a [#], then scrolls to this.. what i have now works, but i heard using eval is bad practice. I tried using [scrollid] but it doesnt work.
20:05  randomOfAmber: is there a way to get jquery to report every single issue it runs into?
20:06  sean`: randomOfAmber, elaborate
20:06  Doonce: when i do [scrollid] i change revs to just #s..
20:06  randomOfAmber: sean`: so I'm trying to use .buttonset(), and it's not working.  I'm not getting any errors, I'd like some :)
20:06  sean`: randomOfAmber, perhaps there aren't any errors
20:07  randomOfAmber: sean`: yes, but then shouldn't it work?  the corredc files are included in the right order, I'm calling it on a container with raido buttons + labels like in the example...
20:07  randomOfAmber: correct*
20:07  sean`: ?details @ randomOfAmber
20:07  bot-t: randomOfAmber, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
20:07  sean`: set up a fiddle
20:07  randomOfAmber: k
20:08  jschoolcraft: sean`: okay, it appears you have to follow an id naming convention that I wasn't. something_id
20:08  sean`: yes

20:13  sean`: hahaha
20:13  sean`: HAHA
20:13  sean`: randomOfAmber, what was the issue again?
20:13  randomOfAmber: .buttonset() .. let me put it back in sry
20:13  jschoolcraft: sean`: heh, you would think this would have been a dead giveaway: If serialize returns an empty string, make sure the id attributes include an underscore
20:14  sean`: dunno
20:14  randomOfAmber: sean`: ok, http://www.jsfiddle.net/nsDpG/1/
20:14  sean`: randomOfAmber, it's about the checkboxes right?

20:19  sean`: <sean`> read the markup, be the markup
20:19  Doonce: is using eval() bad practice? if it is.. how do i do this without using it: http://jsfiddle.net/e3ssN/1/
20:19  randomOfAmber: sean`: but I've READ the markup... that's what I'm saying.  I couldn't find a difference between their example (much like yours) and mine
20:20  Hopsy: vladikoff: hey
20:20  sean`: randomOfAmber, then debug your code
20:20  sean`: It's dead easy
20:20  randomOfAmber: sean`: I have been :S

20:25  guy: it is not ajax based
20:25  vladikoff: guy, you need to implement AJAX with that yourself
20:25  vladikoff: guy, or hire someone to do that for you
20:25  sean`: yes
20:26  paul_uk: even better, learn jquery

21:06  Doonce: it scrolls to the right thing, but when i press the < or > controls it scrolls nonstop
21:06  Doonce: using eval it works fine.
21:06  aro: the docs page doesnt state anything about it
21:07  akheron: Doonce: eval("[1]") -> [1], [srcollid] - ["1"], does this matter?
21:07  Doonce: the goto thing takes a [#]
21:07  Doonce: dont think it can be ["1"]
21:07  akheron: try [parseInt(scrollid)]
21:08  Doonce: that works
21:08  Doonce: that better to use than eval?
21:08  Doonce: im doing it without []s though..
21:09  Doonce: just parseInt(scrollid)
21:09  akheron: If someone can somehow fiddle with the rev's, eval can be used for xss or other bad things
21:09  akheron: so in my opinion you should avoid it if possible
21:09  Doonce: works with or without the brackets
21:09  aro: anyone know?
21:10  sean`: aro, the slider?
21:10  Doonce: ok, so parseInt is fine then?
21:10  sean`: aro, the docs say so www.jqueryui.com/demos/slider
21:10  aro: slide
21:10  akheron: with parseInt you cannot run arbitrary code :)
21:10  aro: not slider
21:10  Doonce: cool, thanks
21:10  sean`: what's jquery slide
21:10  aro: slides an element in or out of viewport
21:12  miloj: hi, is there a way to get a tabs() url with jquery-ui ?

22:43  bot-t: oh snao™ bitch
22:43  alaing: paul_irish: ban him anyway lol
22:44  nvictor: snao?
22:44  mytoz: okay, so basically the idea is that people register on a site (let's call it bookmork, hah), gets a link that they'll drag to their bookmark bar. clicking on the bookmark bar submits the link to the current page they're on silently to bookmork, where it'll be scraped. people can follow each other and thus have a feed of each other's links. so, it's silly.
22:45  mytoz: there's already a whole lot of similar sites, and there's nothing particularly unique about my idea.
22:45  mytoz: although it'd be fun to code. :)
22:46  snover: so…del.icio.us?
22:46  Vorspire: (mytoz): kill it with fire, that would be unique :)
22:46  mytoz: snover: exactly
22:46  Vorspire: nah it sounds good, so good luck:P
22:47  snover: I’m not sure that’s your idea as much as it is…someone else’s idea
22:47  mytoz: yup
22:47  Vorspire: I you have an idea, be assured that the Simpsons Did It first.
22:47  draginx: http://pastie.org/private/tet21clpkmahgj4lhcvqhq why does the a.tooltips have no method live? The a.tooltips is being created within jquery

22:48  mytoz: Vorspire: professor chaos is not amused.
22:48  l4rk: draginx: what do yo umean
22:48  l4rk: it binds an event higher up in the dom
22:48  draginx: l4rk let me re-paste
22:49  Vorspire: ^^
22:49  l4rk: so that nested elements events can be watched for

22:50  draginx: i thought may be somehow delegate would perform the operation differently i tried encapsulating the a.tooltips selector/function inside of $(document).ready() but that also did not do what I wanted to do
22:50  draginx: jQuery is having a hard time finding an object with a.tooltips after adding it through jquery's appendTo
22:51  l4rk: don't bother using delegate there
22:51  l4rk: might as well use live
22:51  draginx: like i said
22:51  draginx: both methods do not achieve what im trying to do
22:51  draginx: it cant even find any a.tooltips despite it being there
22:52  l4rk: welp
22:52  draginx: i was hoping paul was in here :( hed definitely know or snover :P
22:53  l4rk: wow...
22:53 @paul_irish: use livequery
22:53  l4rk: good luck
22:53  SugaSlide: lol
22:54  sean`: lol
22:56  Vorspire: livequery? there was a discussion about that the other day, soemone said it's not needed because it refers to jQuery 1.3.2 ort something?
22:58  sean`: Vorspire, bs
22:58  sean`: livequery taps into jquery methods that play with the dom
22:58  chromiumapps: according to http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery, livequery depends on jQuery 1.3+
22:58  sean`: so each time you add elements that match a specific selector, you can manipulate them
22:58  sean`: not like live does, but in a more specific way

23:04  Nepherius: so , can i make it work this way or i should I find out how to do it with simple js ?
23:05  temp01: jquery is simple js :P
23:05  Nepherius: native than* ^^
23:05  temp01: lemme see
23:06  temp01: use <input type="reset"
23:06  temp01: not javascript
23:06 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 94 seconds
23:06  temp01: also, for defining functions so that you can use them later, don't use $(document).ready like that
23:08  Nepherius: that worked ty
23:08  Nepherius: like what ?
23:08  temp01: don't use document.ready at all for that
23:08  sean`: just outsuide
23:10  Nepherius: i thought it wont work without it :P
23:12  Vorspire: $(document).ready is overrated :P
23:12  draginx: paul_irish: why use livequery?
23:12  draginx: If I'm using jquery 1.4.3 isn't live technically livequery O_o
23:12  sean`: NO
23:13  sean`: read -.-
23:14 @paul_irish: no.
23:14 @paul_irish: read.
23:14  Vorspire: livequery lets you run arbitrary functions on elements now and in the furute with apprently more specifications that .live could, right?
23:15 @paul_irish: live is event based.
23:15 @paul_irish: livequery is omgnewelementswereadded based
23:16  sean`: $('li').livequery (function () { $(this).hide (); }); .. that's what you can do with livequery
23:17  sean`: Live is a mere mortal compared to livequery

23:23  zjwalden: draginx, sean's article explains the difference in the summary
23:24  draginx: thanks :) and yup reading now
23:24  zjwalden: live is event handling(click, mouseover, keydown), whereas livequery will execute code without an event.. atleast that's what i got from it
23:25  zjwalden: anyway, i'm by no means the authority for any kind of answers, but i think that's right.  gotta go, bringing the wife out to eat :)
23:25  zjwalden: take it easy guys, once again thanks sean
23:25  sean`: cheers
23:25  zjwalden: and paul, i plan on reading the duck article later;)
23:26  zjwalden: be good guys, see-ya.
23:26 @paul_irish: :)

23:34  http_Hikari_WS: hey guys could somebody help me with a strange error? http://wordpress.pastebin.com/2hXHGG4U
23:34  paul_uk: hey all, can anyone hazard a guess as to why facebooks "whats on your mind" textbox changes into a contenteditable div with an onclick?  I'm guessing so that the text is html rather than text?
23:34  http_Hikari_WS: it works in my local server, but doesn't work in my host
23:35  guy: Hello again
23:35  guy: I have managed to create my own paging script using the http://d-scribe.de/webtools/jquery-pagination/demo/demo_options.htm
23:35  sean`: http_Hikari_WS, you know the datepicker requires jqueryui also right?
23:36  sean`: nice
23:36  http_Hikari_WS: sean`: http://hik.wptests.hikarinet.info/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui.core.js?ver=1.7.1 is being loaded
23:36  sean`: http_Hikari_WS, that's core, but core dosn't include datepicker
23:36  http_Hikari_WS: sean`: http://hik.wptests.hikarinet.info/wp-content/plugins/hikari-blue-dolphins/jquery.datepick.package-4.0.3/jquery.datepick.min.js?ver=4.0.3 too :)
23:37  guy: as a base. however. I am a bit lost -- I need the pager to appear in two places, thus I created two DIVs $('.navigation') but since pager plugin has an return this.each(function() { [...] it applies the script two times instead just copying pager navigation
23:37  guy: how do I prevent this from happening
23:37  http_Hikari_WS: files are being loaded in the end of HTML document
23:37  http_Hikari_WS: any suggestion on what to do?
23:38  solussd: hello- I'm trying to detect changes to a text input field and append a percent sign like this:      $(':input.Percent').change(function() {$(this).text(function(old) { return old.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '') + '%'; });});   but I get "obj is undefined" console errors everytime I change an input field of class Percent. any ideas?
23:41  http_Hikari_WS: is there a way to see available functions in a jquery object?
23:42  l4rk: http_Hikari_WS: console.dir(jQuery)
23:42  sean`: console.log (jQuery.fn)
23:42  l4rk: ^^ or that :D
23:42  sean`: http_Hikari_WS, use console.log ('datepicker' in jQuery.fn)
23:42  sean`: see if that retuns true
23:43  sean`: also, do a console.log ($('selector').length) on your datepicker selector
23:43  sean`: and also make sure you execute your code on dom ready
23:43  l4rk: also make sure you wash your hands before you eat it
23:44  paul_uk: is there a way of turning a textarea to output html, as in when you do 1 <return> 2 it is actually 1<br/>2 without the need for some plugin perhaps ?
23:44  sean`: catch keydown
23:44  sean`: and halt the return and append a <br>
23:44  icekk: Hey does anyone have any advice on how I can better handle the pagepeel hover effect with the pagepeel wave in the wind wobble effect?  heres the code http://hathol.com/test/javascript/jquery.animation.js  here is the demo  http://hathol.com/test/index.php  It produces weird behavior and I was wondering if anyone had any advice

23:55  zil2: Hi -Having selector problem if anyone can help me... Got 5divs with a class of "Menuitem", eache one has a child/nested div with a class of "submenus". I have hidden all submenus on load, but how do I make just one submenu show? At the moment I can only make them all show... It will work if I give all items a unique class, but I would rather not have to! Any ideas?
23:56  http_Hikari_WS: console.log ('datepicker' in jQuery.fn);   returns true in my local server and false in my host... now why may be causing that difference?
23:56  zil2: ^^ I know the child selector - but can't work it out... tried (".menuitem > .submenus") without any luck.
23:57  solussd: anyone?
23:58  sean`: solussd, the second argument is the current text
23:58  sean`: not the first
23:58  sean`: ?text#sig2
