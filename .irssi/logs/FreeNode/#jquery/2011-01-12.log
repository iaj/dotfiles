00:06  MNU: so i have: var adf = $('#a'); .... i want to apply some css to 'adf' and another selector... something like adf.and($('#b')).css('background-color', '#FFFFFF');
00:08  wutang: i have a hidden table row that has form elements that i clone when i want to add another row...how do I rename the form elements? i tried var new_row = $('#template-row').clone(); var item = new_row.find('input-0'); item.name = 'input-1'; but that doesn't work
00:08  wutang: any ideas?

00:24  dwarder: is it possible to do somehting like this: if(!$(this).attr('tabindex'){continue;} from within each mapped function?
00:24  dwarder: hmm
00:24  dwarder: this is not a loop
00:24  dwarder: but it should do it right?
00:24  dwarder: ohh and i got syntax error
00:26  dwarder: anyway with fixed syntax it still doesn't work
00:27  dwarder: well nevermind i used another construstion
00:29  Tprice: hey
00:29  Tprice: im doing a mouseover
00:30  Tprice: why does it keep triggering the function if the mouse does not move
00:30  dwarder: flickering mouse
00:30  dwarder: ?
00:31  dwarder: i had issue with laser mouse on certain surfaces
00:31  khurram: 4
00:31  Tprice: oh i got it

00:31  Tprice: pop up div was to low

00:42  Tprice: whats the best way to let if the mouse have left or moved out of a div?
00:43  coldhead:  ?mouseover
00:44  coldhead: worst bot-t ever
00:44  coldhead: ?hallllp
00:44  bot-t: coldhead, Couldn't find "hallllp" in jQuery Docs.
00:44  brianpWins: So if I do: $("[id^='section-"+i+"_']:checked") it returns 1 object in an array. if i do $("[id^='section-"+i+"_']:checked").first().attr('selected') i get a number, but if I do $("[id^='section-"+i+"_']:checked").each (function(){ this.attr('section') })  it tells me attr isn't a method
00:45  erichynds: $(this).attr()
00:46  coldhead: ?hover @ Tprice
00:46  bot-t: Tprice, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
00:47  brianpWins: erichynds: Thank you, worked great!
00:48  Tprice: coldhead so i should not use mouseover and mouseout?
00:48  coldhead: Tprice: hover is a shortcut for those guys
00:48  coldhead: use whichever you prefer
00:48  coldhead: i think "hover" sounds more impressive and futuristic
00:53  Tprice: ok thanks coldhead

01:37  dwarder: emulating sleep in javascript is PITA
01:38  dwarder: yes i know ... i just need it
01:39  ironmagma: dwarder: why?
01:40  ironmagma: dwarder: the only reason it seems like you'd need sleep is if you were using a synchronous(=badly designed) framework.
01:43  ironmagma: dwarder: in which case you should boycott the framework and kidnap the designer and hold him hostage until all framework designers switch their frameworks to be event-driven.

01:57  MetaJake: Using .load function to load a 'login' form from an application in a sub-folder, does anyone have any idea how I might set the "Logout" button so that it doesn't attempt to take me to the applications logout page, but rather, stay inside the div that houses the .load(ed) content?
01:57  skione: the page is loaded into a div on a another page, in modal window, does the page I load into the div have access to the libraries on the parent page?
02:01  skione: ug forgot to add the class, I just switched from the regular to the jquery version of tinymce.
02:01  devhen: can someone help me figure out why jquery just isnt working on my page --> http://jquery.pastebin.com/w5LNuhUm
02:02  devhen: onclick="alert($('#checkbox').val())" is working so i know jquery is working, at least somewhat
02:02  devhen: but the event trigger function isnt working at all, i.e. $('#checkbox').click(function() { });
02:03  skione: document.ready?
02:03  skione: I am real new to jquery but the guy who was showing me always told me to include my jquery inside a document.ready block
02:05  skione: http://jquery.pastebin.com/EtUZjwUf devhen
02:05  skione: but again, I'm a rookie
02:07  devhen: skione: that seems to have worked!
02:07  draginx: skione: dont worry about it, I do it still and have been coding in jquery for a long time
02:07  draginx: some people just like to be a pompous little b*tch
02:07  devhen: skione: oh my gosh ... if this works for what im trying to do i might just have to paypal u a thank you donation skione :D
02:07  devhen: cos this has been burgling my turds for 2 days now
02:07  skione: lol
02:07  draginx: 2 days? o-o
02:08  draginx: no problem should take more than 2 days :P
02:08  devhen: draginx: i agree!
02:08  devhen: thats why ive been so frustrated
02:08  devhen: im not a jquery guru but ive been using it for many years ... and i dont think ive ever heard of this document.ready thing
02:08  devhen: and i could not figure out for the life of my why triggers werent working
02:09  skione: yeah my buddy told me that over and over, so I assumed it must be true
02:09  skione: I wish I knew the answer to my div question, I guess I could tias but it seems fairly straight forward
02:10  skione: anyone know how to do a sideways slide in with an ajax load?
02:11  devhen: draginx: admittedly i had only spent about 2 hours on it in those 2 days ;). still was too long for my liking
02:11 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
02:11  PrgmrBill: skione: I would try load, then hide, then apply an effect such as slideDown
02:11  skione: hah
02:11  PrgmrBill: I don't know what the slide in one might be called but it's probably easy to google
02:11  skione: speak of the devil
02:12  skione: I was just talking about you
02:12  PrgmrBill: suhhweeet
02:13  skione: but yeah I had been googling but have not had much luck
02:13  skione: I know there is a fadein
02:13  skione: I assume there would be a slide in as well, since it takes about the same amount of hutzpah
02:14  PrgmrBill: oh there's a slide in"
02:14  skione: there is?
02:14  PrgmrBill: possibly
02:14  skione: I thought it might be slidein().load.() or comething
02:14  skione: but I havent started working on it fully
02:14  skione: I just got tinymce working inside a modal window
02:15  PrgmrBill: did what that guy suggested before work
02:15  aditsu: hi, I have an img with a width attribute (no height), but if I do attr("height") on it it's giving me the height, how can I check if it has a height attribute?
02:15  skione: no
02:16  skione: my problem was I was not using the jquery version of tinymce
02:16  ajpiano: aditsu: try is("[height]")
02:16  aditsu: ajpiano: it says true
02:17  ajpiano: hm
02:17  ajpiano: i donno then
02:17  devhen: skione: im curious, what is the reasoning behind me having to wrap my trigger functions in $(document).ready() ?
02:17  devhen: skione: just so i can make sure i remember this and know in the future when i need to use it again
02:18  devhen: skione: sorry if that didnt make sense. basically im wondering when and why this document.ready() thing is required or is it just something you try out when your functions are being called ?
02:18  devhen: arent*
02:19  skione: I think it is because you want the HTML to finish loading before trying to fire any jquery
02:20  devhen: skione: hmm. makes sense, thats kind of what i was thinking. thanks again! :)
02:20  skione: if it trys to fire on an id at the button of the page it could error out before the page even finishes loading and just like javascript, 1 error nothing works
02:20  skione: np
02:20  aditsu: any significant difference between  $(document).ready(f) and $(f)?
02:21  devhen: aditsu: what do you mean? the dif is that $(document).ready(f) waits to run the f function when the doc finishes loading and $(f) doesnt wait
02:21  ajpiano: wtf
02:21  ajpiano: devhen:
02:21  ngharo: i always through $(f) was a shortcut to $(document).ready(f)
02:22  ajpiano: $(function(){}) is a shortcut to $(document).ready(function(){})
02:22  ajpiano: it is
02:22  aditsu: devhen: it does wait
02:22  devhen: ohh
02:22  devhen: i see!
02:22  devhen: my bad
02:22  alcuadrado: I think I found a little incompatibility in jquery quickExpr for matching ids in html5
02:22  ajpiano: alcuadrado: file a ticket
02:22  ajpiano: with a testcase on jsfiddle
02:23  alcuadrado: but it's not a bug I think
02:23  alcuadrado: en enchacement to that regexp maybe
02:23  ajpiano: either way
02:23  ajpiano: file an enhancement ticket
02:23  alcuadrado: ok (Y)
02:25  aditsu: ajpiano: I'm falling back to $("img")[0].getAttribute("height") (seems to work)
02:27  dwarder: how do i trigger <a href="http://example.com">link</a>
02:27  dwarder: click on it?
02:27 --- Corey is now known as KB1JWQ
02:27  devhen: dwarder: give it an id like this <a id='trigger_link' href.....
02:27  dwarder: #('a').trigger('click') ?
02:27  devhen: dwarder: and then use $('#trigger_link').click(function() { stuff here });
02:28  dwarder: devhen: i need a default behaviour
02:28  devhen: dwarder: but its automatically going to function as a regular link so you may want to take out the href and do the redirection in the trigger
02:28  dwarder: devhen: i.e. open the link
02:28  dwarder: devhen: can't i just trigger click?
02:29  dwarder: devhen: and define nothing?
02:29  dwarder: why i can't?
02:29  devhen: dwarder: sry, dont follow you there
02:29  devhen: what exactly do you want to happen ?
02:29  dwarder: devhen: ('#id').trigger('click');
02:29  ngharo: i believe click only triggers the "onclick" event and not the default behavior
02:30  devhen: dwarder: one way to do it would be to give all your links the same class and then use $('.theclass').click...
02:32 * devhen wonders if the click function will be run before the page reloads to the href loc
02:33  r3negade: hey all, i'm wondering if there's any way to click inside of an iframe from a different url?

02:38  alcuadrado: ajpiano: cool, there was an ticket opened 2 years ago about something like this, and 7 weeks ago snover commented exactly why I wanted to file
02:39  ajpiano: sweet
02:39  ajpiano: alcuadrado, thanks for doing the reserach before fileing ;)
02:39  alcuadrado: btw: not being able to search for "id" in the bug trcker is a little annoying :P

02:42  Chris4645: hi all, if i am using .load() to call a php script with GET variables that interacts with a mysql database, what is the best way to determine if the script (not the HTTP response codes) has succeeded or failed?
02:43  skione: I usually use json to return an array and then create a status variable in it with a success or fail value
02:44  Chris4645: skione: that sounds like it would work. i've never used json before though... big learning curve?
02:45  dwarder: is it possible to press ctrl+right arrow with javascript?
02:45  ngharo: php5 has json_encode()
02:45  alcuadrado: it's the easiest format to learn Chris4645 :)
02:45  ngharo: just feed it a php variable and that's it
02:45  alcuadrado: www.json.org
02:45  Chris4645: thanks
02:46  skione: Chris4645 just stick all your vars in an array and json_encode it, jquery ajax function can be set to read json returns
02:47  aitiba: hi
02:47  skione: then its pretty much the same as a php array in javascript so that should be familiar, at least it was for me
02:48  Chris4645: so i should make the responsetext the result of the json_encode() call?
02:48  alcuadrado: skione approach would work. But it won't take you more than 10 minutes (really) to actually learn and understand json bro
02:48  aitiba: How can I select the br on  form class wpcf7-form p of http://www.aitoribanez.com/que-hacemos/programacion/
02:48  alcuadrado: yes
02:49  skione: alcuadrado you know I kind of thought I was using it "right" since it just worked very intiutively for me. What am I missing?
02:49  alcuadrado: ".wpcf7-form br" aitiba ?
02:51  alcuadrado: you are using it right, but it's useful to learn json by itself in order to be able to read and write it by yourself
02:51  aditsu: huh, ui.position gets messed up when doing droppable from a tab :(
02:51  ngharo: i dont see the need considering there is a json encoder/parser for damn near every language
02:52  skione: alcuadrado I am pretty good at doing XML but I always use writers there as well

03:27  coldhead: well it injects a <script>
03:27  Telegraphs: then realized oh, sigh
03:27  coldhead: so it's kind of up to the browser how it does it
03:28  Telegraphs: yeah, I read up on it earlier
03:28  whitebook: I can add elements but I cant delete them;
03:28  Telegraphs: to me it's just kind of a drag that the browser has such security restrictions.
03:28  Telegraphs: I haven't been coding in JS for long, officially a few days
03:28  coldhead: whitebook: you CAN, you just need to do it right
03:28  coldhead: if it's in the DOM it's fair game
03:28  whitebook: Thats the part I am not sure about;
03:28  coldhead: Telegraphs: it's my early days too
03:28  whitebook: How do I get it into the DOM

03:29  coldhead: append, prepend, replaceWith, html
03:29  coldhead: lots of ways
03:29  whitebook: but its not in the browser DOM
03:29  whitebook: $("#select").append("<tr><td>Test</td></tr>");
03:30  whitebook: Wouldnt that work?
03:30  coldhead: that will append that stuff to the element with id select
03:30  coldhead: assuming it exists
03:30  whitebook: But its not part of the DOM; correct?
03:31  coldhead: no, it is definitely in the dom

03:31  skione: anyone know a rock solid way to control the parent iframe height?
03:31  skione: actually what I really need is a way to dynamically figure out the current page height, that is really where I am failing
03:32  skione: cause I am adding a removing elements all over the place
03:33  skione: duh just youse (document).height(), I need to stop thinking in regular JS
03:34  skione: *use
03:34  coldhead: iframes are hard :(
03:36  skione: actually I have pretty good code for setting the iframe height
03:36  skione: this works all the time parent.window.document.getElementById("com_blockrandom").height = h;
03:36  skione: so long as you know the id of the parent iframe
03:37  skamikaze: someone knows how to jump to the end of a jqueryui effect transition? $(':animated') belongs to a ui-effects-wrapper element (so stop(true,true) doesn't work as expected)
03:40  Chris4645: so i've used json_encode() to encode a php array which looks like this ["1234", "5678"] - and i have used $.parseJSON in my jquery... i'm guessing i need the "name" part of the name/value pairs to access it?
03:41  skione: this is a non associative array
03:41  Chris4645: yes
03:42  skione: if you want to use associative build one in php: $output = array('item'=>'value'); json_encode($output):
03:42  skione: also study on the ajax() jquery function
03:43  skione: that is probably what you are trying to do, this allows you to set POST or GET, and return vars. process on succes/fail and then take the output and pass it to a funciton

03:50  skione: oh yeah thats the stuff!
03:51  harpoon1: coldhead: do I return javascript the same way, but only with the jquery getScript call?  Will it stip out all javascript except the getScript call?
03:53  bentruyman: loneS0m3
03:55  coldhead: harpoon1: no, it should be a .js file with just .js
03:55  coldhead: you want to not inline your JS if you're doing ajaxy things
04:01  joshsmith: does anyone know of a good plugin or something to easily validate that an input is a dollar amount
04:02  joshsmith: either as an integer or up to two decimal places

04:04  harpoon1: coldhead: I must be overlooking something... I want to do an ajax call, return some html with embeded javascript, and run the javascript and render the html in the client.....
04:04  Tprice: what the best way to do an ajax query on window.unload?
04:07  coldhead: harpoon1: you can't do that
04:08  coldhead: you can't embed javascript in html and access it via AJAX
04:08  Tprice: the $(window).unload does not seem to work
04:08  Tprice: or im doing it wrong
04:08 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
04:10  coldhead: ?unload
04:10  bot-t: .unload(handler): Bind an event handler to the "unload" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/unload/
04:10  coldhead: maybe that event doesn't fire for window ?
04:11  coldhead: in which case .bind('beforeunload') might?
04:11  njbair: how do I debug a .get() call?
04:11  Tprice: so something like $(window).bind('beforeunload')
04:14  coldhead: Tprice: yes
04:14  coldhead: i'm not sure it works but it's worth a shot
04:14  Tprice: it works on a page refreash but not when the page gets closed
04:14  Tprice: im using chrome just so you know
04:16  coldhead: Tprice: i would never admit to it but maybe do it without jQuery?
04:16  Aquaguy: Hello
04:16  coldhead: ?mdc onbeforeunload @ Tprice
04:16  bot-t: Tprice, window.onbeforeunload - An event that fires before the unload event when the page is unloaded. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
04:16  serio_: ?mdc onunload
04:16  bot-t: serio_, window.onunload - The unload event is raised when the document is unloaded. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onunload
04:17  coldhead: Tprice: do whatever serio says
04:17  serio_: hah
04:17  serio_: do whatever works?
04:17  coldhead: it's the same thing
04:18  serio_: hardly
04:18  Aquaguy: I'm uploading a file using XHR with PUT method, is there any way to send to the PHP file information about the file itself like filename file extension...
04:18  serio_: I make bad suggestions to people all the time
04:19  coldhead: Aquaguy: probably not, the browser is usually pretty cagey about that stuff
04:19  coldhead: $('<input type="file" />').val() doesn't work everywhere
04:19  serio_: Aquaguy, you'd have to nab that stuff after the file is uploaded with the tools PHP has to offer.
04:20  Aquaguy: I see...
04:21 * coldhead np: retsin - pope street
04:21  Aquaguy: serio the problem about that is for example the last-modified field... it wont be the last-modified data but the data when the file was uploaded.
04:22  serio_: yah, you can't get that kind of detail from the client.
04:22  serio_: at least, not to the best of my knowledge.
04:22  Aquaguy: mmmm maybe I'll send file info by POST, store it in session variables, then upload the file and get back that info from the session
04:23  coldhead: good luck with that bro
04:23  biodegabriel: Can anyone recommend a good jquery plugin for dropdown menus? There are so many out there!! I'm looking for something pretty basic, but hopefully with a nice smooth animation.
04:23  coldhead: i think you need flash for that kind of file detail
04:24  serio_: I don't even think flash can do that shit, but maybe?  Seems like a security thing.  Like, "let's just evaluate these files on the clients machine"
04:24  serio_: doesn't sound quite right.
04:24  harpoon1: coldhead: What's the best way to run some javascript code when I return some ajax html... should I watch for my div using .live?
04:24  serio_: there's the success callback
04:25  coldhead: ^^
04:25  harpoon1: Seems strange that ajax can retrieve and run javascript, retreive html, but not both...
04:25  Aquaguy: the info that I'm going to lookup in the client side is the filename, nothing serious.
04:25  coldhead: harpoon1: it's nominally to prevent XSS
04:25 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
04:26  coldhead: if you want to fetch and run arbitrary JS you better be mindful and explicit about it
04:26  serio_: Aquaguy, ask them to type it in? :)
04:26  harpoon1: coldhead: but are there not hacks for the xss?
04:26  fruitwerks: hmm when you do $("#foo").text("blah"); how do you get a quote in there, I tried the escape codes and they print as is
04:27 --- watermark86 is now known as watermark
04:27  serio_: '"blah"', escape characters should work.
04:27  Aquaguy: serio_ no, when the user drops the file in the drag&drop area the browser checks the filename, file size and file type
04:28  fruitwerks: I tried ('some "quote".') but that threw an error too, escapes print the actual code
04:28  coldhead: harpoon1: one hack is to wrap your js in <span id="secretJS">alert('etc')</span> and then go eval( $('#secretJS').text(); )
04:28  coldhead: people will kill you for doing that though
04:28  wookiehangover: ugh, please don't use eval
04:29  serio_: Aquaguy, see ?g drag-anything
04:29  bot-t: Aquaguy, HTML5 Demo: Simple Drag and Drop - http://html5demos.com/drag-anything
04:29  fruitwerks: haha.. that looks dirty :)
04:29  harpoon1: I want to use the best approach... how do you guys do it?
04:29  coldhead: in the success handler, like serio said
04:29  harpoon1: oh
04:30  harpoon1: jquery mobile does not have that event...
04:30  serio_: ?
04:30  coldhead: you're right, it just does the load for you behind the scenes
04:30  harpoon1: ok
04:31  Aquaguy: serio_ My script does read filetipes and so on.
04:31  Aquaguy: fileName: "tmp672518610.jpg"
04:31  Aquaguy: fileSize: 75312
04:31  Aquaguy: name: "tmp672518610.jpg"
04:31  Aquaguy: size: 75312
04:31  Aquaguy: type: "image/jpeg"
04:31  coldhead: in that case they're going to expect you to load all your JS initially, and then call it as needed
04:31  harpoon1: maybe the pagecreate event...
04:31  harpoon1: how do I call it?
04:31  coldhead: all i know is LUNCH TIME
04:31  serio_: Aquaguy, so then you're golden?
04:31  harpoon1: ok
04:33  Aquaguy: serio_ you are what? lol sorry my english is kind of basic.
04:33  serio_: well, it sounds like you're all done then?
04:34  serio_: your script is already doing everything you need...
04:37  harpoon1: Question - I have an ajax call which returns some html including a div for a google chart.  I normally use the .ready function to call the .gchart, but seeing that I'm now attempting to return it in an ajax call, the javascript wont' execute.  How do I trigger the javascript to be executed?  I'm using jquery mobile...
04:38 --- c4rl-afk is now known as c4rl
04:38  Aquaguy: serio_ but I dont know how to pass that info to the PHP file in the server side
04:38  serio_: what? dude, I'm so confused now, what are you trying to do?
04:39  serio_: just use $_POST or $_GET to send to the server...
04:40  serio_: if all you're doing is taking data from JS and sending that to the server, it should be pretty straight forward.
04:40  harpoon1: is there a jquery mobile irc?
04:40  serio_: harpoon1, this is it. see the topic?
04:41  harpoon1: oh
04:41  serio_: #jQuery for all your jQuery/UI/Mobile needs
04:41  serio_: (at least, when people are around)
04:41  harpoon1: I need help
04:42  harpoon1: I'll take a break to have peanut butter and jelly toast, but I hope someone has answered my query by the time I'm done, it's a real stumper
04:47  serio_: harpoon1, what method are you using to make the ajax calls?
04:47  harpoon1: post
04:48  serio_: that shit has success callback
04:48  harpoon1: using jquery mobile?
04:48  serio_: it's the same shit.
04:49  serio_: jqmobile is just some stuff that goes on top of jQuery, both are on the page aren't they?
04:49  harpoon1: but mobile does the ajax call for me.. how do I hook into the success?
04:50  harpoon1: my toast just popped up out of the toaster, back in 10 seconds
04:50  serio_: heh
04:50  serio_: are you just doing $.post( 'myfile.php' ) ?
04:51  serio_: $.post( 'myfile.php', function(data) { alert( data ) } );
04:52  harpoon1: jquery mobile does all that behind the scenes
04:53  harpoon1: serio_
04:54  serio_: yo
04:54  harpoon1: jquery mobile does all that behind the scenes
04:54  serio_: I read that the first time you typed it bro
04:54  serio_: but thanks
04:54  tbranyen: behind the seens
04:54  harpoon1: behind
04:54  serio_: truthfully, I'm not that well versed in jQ mobile (obviously)
04:55  harpoon1: fantastic
04:55  serio_: can I see some code?
04:55  harpoon1: you just include the jquery mobile and away it goes
04:55  serio_: ...
04:56  serio_: oh, I see
04:57  serio_: so, you're not using the changePage method?
04:57  harpoon1: my first question was weather I should use changePage
04:58  serio_: ?tias
04:58  bot-t: Try It And See
04:58  harpoon1: but that will run for every page load...
04:58  harpoon1: not very smooth
04:59  harpoon1: but thanks, I'll try it and see
04:59  harpoon1: i did'nt think of that
04:59  serio_: lawl, I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful dude.
05:00  harpoon1: ;)
05:00  serio_: jQ mobile is still alpha, so it's got a ways to go yet.
05:01  harpoon1: yeah
05:01  harpoon1: but it runs just fine
05:01  harpoon1: for what I need... other than this running javascript embeded in html returned by an ajax call.....
05:02  serio_: I mean more in regards to documentation and like, how familiar people are with it.

05:16  Aliv3: oh i see it
05:16  Aliv3: sry just doesnt bother me idk how to fix
05:16  Aliv3: whats $(this).dequeue();
05:16  ss23: Looks like it's putting the new menu entries in before the others have faded away
05:16  Aliv3: oh nevermind
05:17  ss23: So it has the current and the previous stuff listed for a tiny bit, then the previous' ones stuff disapears
05:17  Aliv3: oh yea
05:17  Aliv3: thats whats happening
05:17  Aliv3: $(".sub_nav").fadeOut(100);                      $(this).siblings(".sub_nav").fadeIn(100); <- no break between these, they happen async
05:22 * coldhead np: swans - no words/no thoughts
05:27  harpoon1: I thought ajax did not eval javascript??  I just seen this in the docs: "html": Returns HTML as plain text; included script tags are evaluated when inserted in the DOM.

05:28  coldhead: where's it say that?

05:31  eponym: coldhead, well I'm going TO prototype from jQuery. I need to learn it for a job. I'd just like to be systematic about it so that I'm not tripping over my feet expecting jQueryishness.

05:33  coldhead: eponym: its harder going the other way, you'll miss jquery badly
05:34  coldhead: harpoon1: i haven't seen that work in practice with jQuery mobile. i don't think whatever it uses for navigation eval()s embedded JS

07:22  CoolCoder: anyone knows anything about jquerymobile? please help me why no javascript is working on cached pages.
07:23  Aquaguy: I'm trying to do a image zoomer, but I'm kind of... idiot or something. at 50% of the slider I want the image to be at 100% of its original size, then If you slide up to 100%, I want the image to be 100% bigger than it's original size. In the oposite case, if you slide towards 0 I want the image to be smaller
07:23  Aquaguy: anyone can help me out with this?
07:23  tbranyen: CoolCoder: that doesn't sound like a jquery mobile issue
07:26  CoolCoder: i think its because the pages are cached. like i have written some functions in $( function(). this is not working on chached pages(with # because all forms are redirected with #). other pages its working, i am sure there will be someways to work with scripts for this pages. because jQueryMobile uses this # ing for everypages

08:13  paul_irish: $(this).addClass .

08:14  iaj: lo there - I got a task to solve, if you would take a look on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=9 please... theres those foldable <h3> tags.. however.. as you can see theres a arrow showing on the bottom of the folded thingie, generated by background: url css flag... is there any way to add a click event to those 'arrow up images' as well?
08:14  paul_irish: start console.log()ing in there
08:15  Conexion: Basically I'm trying to iterate through all the paragraphs and give it a different class
08:15  Conexion: Alright I'll take a look at that
08:15  RoaDin: Okay I am a Jquery noob, and been watching the room to see if someone has an issue like mine, but I'm trying to do a submit button in a populated DIV that I get from another PHP and cannot seem to get it to submit. I already have one form already on the page, in another DIV that works well already with the jquery. I just need to figure out how to get jquery to recognize the form in the other <div>...
08:16  paul_irish: iaj: .block { position:relative; } and then put a element for the clickable trigger inside that's bottom: 3px or wahtever
08:16  paul_irish: orrr
08:16  Tprice: how would something like $().css('border-bottom') work
08:16  paul_irish: its only visible when block is open and its full width
08:17  Tprice:  want to get the color from the border
08:17  paul_irish: Tprice: you need to get borderBottomColor

08:22  jhine: Ok: http://86.159.119.120 - Can anyone tell me why slidedown() isnt working? it quickly shows, then goes O_O

08:23  unfo-: jhine, http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
08:24  iaj: paul_irish: hmmm you mean I need to have a img src there instead of a background image?
08:24  jhine: woo its up
08:24  nlogax: jhine: the page is reloading
08:24  paul_irish: maybe
08:24  paul_irish: maybe i'm just not being creative.
08:24  jhine: nlogax: ?
08:24  jhine: o
08:24  paul_irish: figuring out click position from the event probably isnt a great idea, though doable
08:24  nlogax: jhine: it slides down, the the page reloads and is back to where it was
08:25  jhine: How can I stop the page reloading?
08:25  nlogax: jhine: add function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... } in your handler
08:25  apollo9: would the e.preventDefault();
08:25  apollo9: help?
08:26  Conexion: Derp derp, paul_irish , the problem was in my CSS. I used # instead of . on accident =p
08:26  jhine: Okay, so that works but now it doesnt slide, it just 'shows'
08:26  nlogax: jhine: o wait, it's a form, so you should probably put it on the form's submit instead of button click
08:27  nlogax: jhine: tables usually don't like being told what to do. could try putting it in a div, then animate the div instead
08:27  jhine: ah ok :P
08:28  jhine: perfect, thanks!
08:31  Conexion: Hmm, does anything look wrong here? || $('#content > p').each(function(index)
08:31  Conexion: I want to select all paragraphs that are children of the #content id
08:31  apollo9: user .children()
08:31  Conexion: Alright, I'll try that :)
08:31  paul_irish: $('#content').children().filter('p')
08:32  paul_irish: maybe.
08:32  paul_irish: probably gets you the same.
08:32  tbranyen: instead of children('p') ?
08:33  apollo9: Hey paul_irish just curious to what the difference between children('p')  and children().filter('p') would make.
08:34  Conexion: None of them seem to be working... could it be because I'm using the HTML5 tag "<section>" ?
08:34  paul_irish: probably the same.
08:34  tbranyen: apollo9: might as well add $("#content > p") into that too
08:34  tbranyen: they are just differnet ways of writing the same thing
08:34  paul_irish: Conexion: in IE? without modernizr? yes.
08:34  paul_irish: you would have a problem.
08:34  Conexion: I'm testing in Firefox, and I've added the elements for IE
08:34  apollo9: tbranyen: cool, I didn't know if there was some sort of performance boost or something.
08:34  Conexion: but I'm not worried about IE yet =p
08:35  tbranyen: apollo9: probably, but you won't notice it
08:35  paul_irish: Conexion: try your selector in firebug console already
08:35  paul_irish: try EVERYTHING in the console

09:11  paul_irish: i have
09:11  ocf: paul_irish has used all.
09:11  Aquaguy: paul_irish it worked for you?
09:11  paul_irish: yeah it did
09:11  Aquaguy: I've plenty of images and it never calls the callback function
09:12  Aquaguy: I've printed out the len variable in the console and it's always 0
09:12  Aquaguy: how do you "attach" this loader to the images? maybe that is what Im doing wrong
09:12  ocf: $('elem').imagesLoaded() ?

09:13  paul_irish: iaj: "previous" how
09:13  paul_irish: like.. previous sibling? or ancestor
09:13  paul_irish: also. same with "next"
09:14  ocf: $('this').closest('div.slideable-box') will get you the previous ancestor, right paul_irish?

09:14  paul_irish: arr1.concat(arr2)

09:15  etpace: do you know if thats supported in chrome?

09:15  paul_irish: dont lie
09:15  blackspotwiggins: that is somewhat hard to believe
09:16  etpace: Uncaught TypeError: Object function Array() { [native code] } has no method 'concat'

09:16  mekwall: paul_irish: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mcWnL/25/ <--- that's better I guess :p
09:16 * paul_irish checks stable..

09:16  blackspotwiggins: it definitely works
09:16  Aquaguy: mmm paul_irish thank you
09:17  etpace: x.concat(..) works in chrome, but Array.concat does not
09:17  blackspotwiggins: Array.concat by itself does nothing
09:17  ocf: i've heard a rumor of w3fools.com being even better
09:17  etpace: Array.concat(a1,a2);
09:17  etpace: obviously
09:17  paul_irish: that doesnt exist.
09:17  paul_irish: but you can do
09:17  etpace: does in firefox
09:17  blackspotwiggins: a1.concat(a2) is too mainstream?
09:18  paul_irish: well i dont think that's specced at all.
09:18  JKarsrud: firefox sucks
09:18  JKarsrud: :P

09:37 * ocf read an awesome article from Stoyan Stefanov on caching, today
09:37  sean`: Aquaguy, 'cause that way you can directly have access to your P, instaed of having to search for it.

10:00  xotix: i have a func which generates a file and then i wanted a downlado out of it so i just made a open(path) in the callback with the parameters i get. it works in ff but not in ie, why?
10:02  peol: xotix: Sorry, but I don't see what jQuery has to do with that
10:02  blackspotwiggins: oneman, all i see is a youtube video?
10:02  blackspotwiggins: where is the example
10:03  xotix: its in the callback of a jquery post and also it isnt suchs spezific js only question...

10:06  paul_irish: does it actually equalize?

10:07  paul_irish: he's protecting his coadz
10:07  xotix: http://pastebin.com/Bzt6JMFN its about generating a .odt. it makes you a clickable list of all you items. when you click on it, it gets generated and you get the download.
10:08  paul_irish: oneman: i work for google chrome .. and we've been talking about constructing the full winamp UI a few times.. this is pretty damn sweet
10:08  oneman: Here is the reason there is no live sample above all other reasons, I don't want to support the alpha code as it is, I figure if its liked then the alpha code would get out there and there would instantly be 100 patched versions and it would not be good
10:08  paul_irish: oneman: let me know when you're ready and i'd love to give you some cash if you would let me toy around with the code

10:54  blackspotwiggins: you could just do 'se'
10:55  russinkungen: arr['se'] returns undefined. I'm guessing it's indexbased since I'm not querying an object.

11:04  mekwall: can't they just go for x264 instead :P
11:04  ablomen: mekwall, make your textarea display block
11:05  blackspotwiggins: x264 is only encoder
11:05  ablomen: mekwall, its the line height that makes the wrapper higher

11:10  akheron: not right now, exactly, but will the patents become an issue as (afaik) some parts of webm quite closely resemble h.264

11:11  blackspotwiggins: however with mpeg-la you are guaranteed to pay if you have >100000 clients
11:12  blackspotwiggins: the thing about image/video compression is, every good/usable method is patented by someone (probably)

11:13  blackspotwiggins: lobaman, wat?
11:14  blackspotwiggins: you remove the attribute before the click

Now when I click on the right side of the handle and start moving the mouse it jumps to the middle. If I click on the left side and start moving it's even worse.

12:46  Lee_msi: or use children
12:47  Lee_msi: look at the jquery docs for the traversing stuff, a few ways it can be done
12:47  Kasreyn: if i have .ui-widget-header { background: #cccccc } css, how can i read/get the background value and store it in a variable in javascript?
12:47  Lee_msi: u need to assign that to an element
12:47  Lee_msi: then use css('background')

12:53  koichirose: Hi, I have this code: http://pastebin.com/zseQ0KTu . It is working for the first click (it correctly adds a new input) then it doesn't work anymore. But I get the input file in the console. What am I doing wrong?

12:58  koichirose: Kambfhase, solved like this: http://pastebin.com/iJMDPaNN
12:58  koichirose: Kambfhase, I don't really know why though.
12:58  Kambfhase: yep
12:59  koichirose: In  the previous version, I was cloning the file input and saving it as 'file_input', then appending the cloned one to the div.
12:59  koichirose: Now I'm appending a clone of file_input to the div. What is the difference?
13:00  Kambfhase: the differencce is, that you now clone it egain for each click!
13:01  Kambfhase: in the old version you only cloned it once!
13:02  dyllan: Kambfhase: I got this far but nothing is happening:  http://pastebin.com/rTKhXxfV
13:02  koichirose: Kambfhase, but now if I select an image in the first file input, then add another one, the new one has the same image as the first
13:03  ablomen: koichirose, $("#my_uploader").append(file_input.clone().val("")); should do it
13:04  koichirose: ablomen, that was easy. thanks :)
13:04  Kaspi: hey guys
13:04  dyllan: Kambfhase: wait i made a typo let me try again
13:12  Kaspi: I'm trying to get familiar with the jquery UI (following this tutorial http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started ). I have added a <input type="text" name="date" id="date"> into my template file and linked it with the necessary styles and javascript (as described in the tutorial). Then, in my JS file, I call: $(document).ready(function() { $('#date').datepicker(); }); When I click the date input then on the generated page, nothing happens, what can be wrong?
13:13  dr0id: hey sean`
13:13  dr0id: there ?
13:13  sean`: sup?
13:14  koichirose: Kaspi, try to post a little bit more code somewhere. Does the console say anything?
13:15  ^jt: is there a way to detect when a <select>'s child menu is open?
13:18  Rayden[MODx]: how come i cant delay .attr('src') or make it fadeIn after loading a new image? -> http://pastebin.com/2q6wjZR2
13:18  Kambfhase: delay only works with effects
13:19  Kambfhase: you could use setTimeout though.
13:19  Rayden[MODx]: ok, but how can i que the attr('src') to go after animate, but before fadeIn?
13:20  Rayden[MODx]: setTimeout( $('img',this).attr('src',img.src) ,300 ); like this?
13:20  Kambfhase: animate can also take a callback
13:20  Kaspi: koichirose: it was due to wrong permissions, the webserver couldn't access the core files
13:21  koichirose: Kaspi, ok :)
13:21  Kaspi: koichirose: thanks though
13:21  koichirose: np
13:21  Kambfhase: Rayden[MODx]: more like: setTimeout(function(){ $('img',this).attr('src',img.src);} ,300 );
13:22  Rayden[MODx]: ok thanks Kambfhase i give it a try as callback of animate, else i try setTimeout

13:31  abracsi_: guys, if you have a lot of html on a page, does hiding elements help speed up animations on that page in a anyway?
13:31  blackspotwiggins: abracsi_, somewhat
13:31  blackspotwiggins: a good practice would be to put the stuff being animated in a position:absolute; container
13:32  blackspotwiggins: so it would not trigger reflow on the rest of the page
13:32  abracsi_: i see
13:32  abracsi_: ok thanks
13:32  blackspotwiggins: also, if you use css transitions
13:32  blackspotwiggins: it is much much much faster
13:32  abracsi_: css transitions?
13:33  blackspotwiggins: yes
13:33  abracsi_: sorry what exactly are css transitions?
13:33  blackspotwiggins: abracsi_, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/CSS_transitions
13:34  abracsi_: right so this is outside jQuery
13:34  blackspotwiggins: yes
13:34  blackspotwiggins: it's done natively on the browser
13:34  blackspotwiggins: and only triggers repaint

13:45  unfo-: Bjornet, paste the code that causes the error?-D
13:45  Aamir: Bjornet what do you by "  that corresponds to a SPAN elem "
13:45  Bjornet: Aamir: what do you by?
13:46  Bjornet: unfo: see the fiddle above
13:46  unfo-: Bjornet, ahhh soz. didn't notice :)
13:46  Aamir: r3negade: i used a wordpress plugin and they were using iframe, there must another way i am sure
13:46  Kambfhase: Bjornet: your img elemts do not have a class, so you selector is wrong.
13:46  Bjornet: ah
13:46  Bjornet: ok, so the "this" corresponds to what comes out of that .child() selector
13:47  Aamir: Bjornet:  ah sorry just saw the link :P leme check
13:47  Bjornet: children
13:47  Kambfhase: Bjornet: yep.
13:47  Bjornet: ah that might be the prob then, lemme check
13:49  Aamir: Bjornet:  a clean html (without php code, which doesn't work on jsfiddle) would be helpful
13:49  Bjornet: yep I provide that if needed now or til next time

13:58  russinkungen: JKarsrud: looks nice, but I'm looking for something free. I'm using it commercially and it's a wee bit expensive.
13:58  sean`: ankur, you should take a look at the bbq pulgin
13:59  blackspotwiggins: russinkungen, netbeans is an option, altho not a super good one
13:59  ankur: yeah i tried
13:59  ankur: i am using hashchange jquery
13:59  ankur: due to my code is maintaining browser history for sub tabs items
14:00  ankur: but my main tabs sequence got distorted
14:00  sean`: ankur, it takes a lot of the extra changes you need for hashchange
14:00  sean`: als it supports multiptle containers
14:00  sean`: it's exactly what you want

14:01  sean`: ankur, check out the examples
14:02  russinkungen: blackspotwiggins: yeah I've used netbeans for java-development. never tried it for anything web oriented though. I've got visual studio 2010 but it seems a little to heavy weight for front-end stuff.
14:02  blackspotwiggins: russinkungen, netbeans, when i last used it, did not have html5 support
14:02  blackspotwiggins: as in it didnt recognize new elements
14:02  blackspotwiggins: it also tends to be on the slow side
14:02  blackspotwiggins: but its quite reliable

It worked and was fast with the old autocomplete but now it hangs after a while and firefox asks if it should stop the script.. is there a workaround for this or is the problem something else?
14:19  rahmen: Note: It freezes when I start typing in the input field.
14:22  sac_: rahmen, use xhr^H^H^Hajax for the autocomplete loading and limit the amount of possible autocompletions if there are too many results at once

14:23  phrearch: hm, i wonder if loading javascript over a websocket and eval'ing it on arrival would have certain advantages above using something like requirejs
14:24  phrearch: that is using http for loading
14:24  blackspotwiggins: phrearch, if you have a lot of small snippets, you would win by not having to create new connection(s)
14:24  blackspotwiggins: if pipelining is enabled and working, it should not be too costly
14:24  phrearch: blackspotwiggins, but caching would become another issue. all stuff is loaded on each connection

14:28  bot-t: SugaSlide, Okay.
14:28  blackspotwiggins: if you only use it for loading content, it might be simpler
14:29  phrearch: yea, i thought it may be easier to have request-like websocket calls, which include all necessary js for that particular view/module
14:29  blackspotwiggins: actually, it is definitely simpler

14:33  rahmen: sac_: The problem is that if I start writing an "a" almost every tag is a result.. but I can't limit the results more :) I'm getting my results from a mysql database and populate the available tags with a php foreach loop. So everything is on the page. I'm not sure about the meaning of ajax.. I should just replace the database with an XML and it's ajax? :P And I can't see how another way can...
14:33  rahmen: ...make things faster since I think it's the regex search that takes too long. Do you agree on that?

15:01  destinydriven: Aamir: yeah but after form is posted, how to tell that its just been posted as opposed to a page refresh
15:01  destinydriven: thats my problem
15:02  Aamir: destinydriven: are you submitting the form with ajax?
15:02  destinydriven: Aamir: NO
15:03  destinydriven: sorry for caps
15:03  Aamir: destinydriven: than the page should refresh right?
15:03  Aamir: what you want exactly when user click the submit button?
15:04  destinydriven: Aamir: when user clicks the submit button, I was the accordion containing search form to return collapsed
15:05  Aamir: destinydriven:  collapsed and than let the form submit (refresh the page) ?
15:05  Aamir: destinydriven: ??
15:05  destinydriven: Aamir: no. actually its doing that right now. After form submit, I want the search form collapsed
15:06  russinkungen: destinydriven: something like http://jquery.malsup.com/form/?
15:06  destinydriven: lemme check it out
15:07  Aamir: destinydriven: not sure what is your question. You mean form is submitted, page is refresh and now you want the form to collapsed ?
15:07  destinydriven: Aamir: thats right
15:08  Aamir: if yes than in your php or whatever language you can create a hidden div or span e.g  <span style="display:none" id="formSubmittedOrSomething"></span>  and in jQuery check if it exists and collapse the form
15:08  Aamir: destinydriven: ^
15:08  russinkungen: Hmm.. my idea was to post the form async in ajax and then collapse it on callback.
15:08  destinydriven: Aamir: hmm ok
15:09  Aamir: russinkungen: he is not using ajax, thats what i asked him
15:09  denysonique: http://browserling.com/ Cross-browser testing from the comfort of your browser! -- seems interesting
15:09  destinydriven: russinkungen: I thought about using ajax but it will be slower
15:09  russinkungen: k, seems lika a hassle to do a postback and check for hidden fields.
15:10  Aamir: lol ajax is faster than refreshing the whole page
15:10  destinydriven: Aamir: the amount of data being returned can be huge
15:11  Aamir: destinydriven:  so its not post but get?
15:11  destinydriven: yeah
15:11  Aamir: still it will be faster than refreshing the whole page
15:12  destinydriven: Aamir: ok will look into using ajax
15:12  Aamir: but it should degrade gracefully if no js support is available

15:41  sean`: ml
15:41  dmsuperman: dyllan: It looks roughly like: find some node. Set that node's contents to nothing. Then request contents from a file using an ajax request. Then store the results in that original node
15:42  dmsuperman: dyllan: So to do that you'll want to look at the following: jquery's selector (to find the node), jquery's ajax handler (to request the contents of the file), and jquery's html function (to set the contents of the node to empty/ajax results)
15:42  dyllan: dmsuperman: yes, that's exactly what it does. Find a #div clear it, then take contents from <input> send them to another file, retrieve the output and place into the #div
15:43  jtarragon: thinkt4nk_work: no, no. I have the labels divs hidden on the page, and just calling fadeIn for the correct one
15:43  Derppy: juha_: I tried setting said properties to about all the elements, but I didn't get desired results. I'd need the container and other columns to grow with the longest column.

15:43  thinkt4nk_work: are they just hidden divs in the html?
15:43  jtarragon: thinkt4nk_work: that's right
15:44  thinkt4nk_work: and when you mouseover a single element that is bound to that event, two divs fadeIn at the same time?
15:44  thinkt4nk_work: or that is the perceived effect, anyway?
15:44  jtarragon: thinkt4nk_work: that's exactly it
15:44  thinkt4nk_work: post the code to pastebin and link it
15:44  dyllan: dmsuperman: Sounds right thanks. I was able to fetch the contents of the file, and display them in an alert(). I think the part im struggling with is the selector, to fetch from the 'node' and push back to the 'node'.
15:45  jtarragon: thinkt4nk_work: I've got a $('.labels).hide(); before the $('label'+id).fadeIn, but still doesn't work

16:47  timmywil: birliban, if you call them from within doc ready it doesn't matter really but it looks better outside.  everything should be in a closure though.
16:47  timmywil: funkydude, .click(function(e) { e.target })

16:50  FunkyDude: ok thanks
16:51  jaql: Kambfhase: no no, i know that as requests are sent, they are put in line and get processed in whatever order they are clicked.  but if i click the link 'foo' once, and then click it again before the first request finishes, it stops trying to use ajax to inject the content and it just loads the actual page into my browser.
16:51  Kambfhase: o.O
16:52  jaql: clicking different links in succession works fine, it's clicking the same one more than once before it actually injects the content that's causing a problem

17:05  timmywil: zeen, you can attach the listable functions to the jQuery prototype, or, maybe a better option, have listable return it's own prototype.  It's a tradeoff, if you do the latter you'll have access to all of listable's functions without getting more into jQuery's namespace, but you won't be able to do regular jQuery chaining.

17:34  pallet: denysonique, you there dude ?
17:35  mordof: i have a list and a slider is currently applied to it, if i use a selector on those list items, how would i tell what # the list item with 'current' is?
17:35  mordof: would i have to do like an each thing.. and check each list item for that class?
17:36  Kambfhase: jaql: did you fix that other problem with the rebinding?
17:37  jaql: Kambfhase: yeah that seems to work
17:37  jaql: Kambfhase: no more duplicater requests
17:38  denysonique: pallet: yes
17:38  Kambfhase: jaql: I think i got it: you prevent Default on the first event.
17:38  pallet: denysonique, are you running FF 3.6
17:38  jaql: Kambfhase: should that not be there? or should it be somewhere else?
17:39  Kambfhase: but then you remove this handler so upon the second click there is no more handler which could preventDefault!
17:40  jaql: Kambfhase: ok removing that line breaks it haha
17:40  jaql: Kambfhase: so what do you suggest doing?
17:40  Altreus: OK so there's a 1-pixel-high element on a page and I can't seem to click on it due to fail. Does anyone know a way I can set up a sort of hover zone around the element that will highlight it when entered, so I can click on that instead?
17:40  Kambfhase: either big deeper into that rebind problem or bind another handler after the unbind
17:41  Altreus: I intend to set up a highlight for hovering on many elements, but the hover zone needs to have a minimum size without disrupting the page layout
17:41  Altreus: hmm I suppose I could float an absolutely-positioned div over the top of the element and use that as the hover zone

17:50  Marsikato: How can I prevent that the option with the value "Please select" ist used in the function? http://jsfiddle.net/Wx9m7/
17:50  teddy_: and therefore i thought maybe highchart would be great but
17:51  teddy_: i couldnt figured it out
17:51  jaql: Kambfhase: yeah there's no js coming from that page
17:51  teddy_: i want data to be choosed in a view and pasted to a controller to get the data from a model
17:52  jaql: Kambfhase: there's a crapton of javascript on the page the uses this script though
17:52  Kambfhase: jaql: well if it works with the hackish way, your fine.
17:53  teddy_: thats how it looks at the moment
17:53  teddy_: http://pastebin.com/5iFgRKaH
17:57  Kambfhase: teddy_: you can use .focusout(function(){}) and check within that function if a valid option was chosen

18:14  digitalfiz: can someone show me how i can do something to a "tr" tag when one of the "td" tags inside it contains a "input" with a certain value?
18:15  Kambfhase: Marsikato: nope, it means that if the str is "Please select" the function reaturns early so the following code will not be executed
18:16  Marsikato: Kambfhase: return -> don't execute

18:18  Jonz: Kris`, i'm not sure that comparing strings like that will work the way you want, try a few test cases to verify
18:18  Kambfhase: Marsikato: or i could have written it liike this: http://jsfiddle.net/Wx9m7/4/
18:18  Kambfhase: chipnt: there is no print function.
18:18  kojiro: isn't version checking generally frowned upon?
18:19  chipnt: Kambfhase how could i send to print when page is loaded then ?
18:19  Marsikato: Kambfhase: better ;)
18:19  Kambfhase: chipnt: sorry, i am talking shit.
18:19  Jonz: what I mean is, what makes a string "greater" than another string may not be what you think.. or maybe it is.  If that doesn't work, another option would be to split it by the periods and then parse the major and minor version number as integers and then compare them that way
18:20  Kris`: Jonz: It works in every browser though. Even IE6..
18:20  ajpiano: Kris`: why do you need write code that checks the jQuery version?

19:38  joelklabo: I am doing jQuery getJSON and sending it a data parameter, on the server side how do I access it? I tried 'data', request.data, etc....
19:38  Trixer: So I got multiple divs that are set resizeable that are nested with in other resizeable divs, and what I am wanting to do is when you resize the children it resizes its parent container is that possible?
19:39  Trixer: Joelklabo: You need to use a server side lang I believe, like php or perl, to proccess it and ehco back a request
19:40  Trixer: #jquery
19:40  Trixer: blah
19:40  Trixer: http://ennuidesign.com/blog/JSON:+What+It+Is,+How+It+ACWorks,+and+How+to+Use+It/
19:40  Trixer: If your new to json start with others apis that give you expected server returns
19:41  ajpiano: joelklabo: however you'd access variables that are passed in the URL in your framework
19:41  joelklabo: Trixer: I am using Django
19:42  Trixer: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/
19:42  Trixer: lol never used it but did a fast search on the docs and I think that will get you started bro
19:42  Trixer: either just echo back your data in a raw format with a echo "my stuff"; or use a view to pass it back in a preformed XML style
19:43  ajpiano: joelklabo: request.GET.get("foo") ?
19:43  joelklabo: ah, that must be it. i tried request.data
19:43  Trixer: so guys on that note, anyone know how to make a child resize the parent? I am  not the best at design so it might be super easy..
19:43  pashmi: anybody know how can I always return false in form validation?????????????
19:44  Trixer: make a validation rule that always fails?
19:44  Trixer: I don tknow though I use ajax forms and proccess alot of my validation server side
19:44  ajpiano: Trixer, children should force their parents to resize unless they're floated...
19:44  pashmi: yes
19:44  Trixer: ajpiano, they might be floated in the CSS that comes with jquiery UI i will check that but right now I have multiple divs nested all resizeable
19:44  Kasreyn: children shouldn't resize their parants. it makes for bad movie sequels
19:45  Trixer: and if you resize one thats nested it just goes pas tthe other
19:45  ajpiano: yah...resizables are positioned absolutely
19:45  ajpiano: sooo that also could affect it
19:45  ajpiano: ( i'd think )
19:47  ^Lestat: lol Kasreyn
19:47  Trixer: ajpiano: any ideas how to over come the problem?
19:48  ajpiano: Trixer: you could use the resizable callbacks to resize the parent
19:49  ^Lestat: my autocomplete() does work, however Addr1 quickly flashes with the correct value then it reverts to the selected label value: http://pastebin.com/XKC4TgtR
19:49  Trixer: ahh yeah, I was thinking that but it just seems like alot of work... cause like if you saw what I was working on that would be a shit ton of calls backs

20:58  ravenzz: testo you have to select every checkbox that was checked

21:02  geekbuntu: hi, does anyone have a clue/site that shows how to upload a fileobject && data objects via ajax?
21:03  Lumpio-: What's a "fileobject"?
21:03  vacho: geekbuntu: u mean a file right? just google "ajax fileuploader"
21:03  geekbuntu: Lumpio-, like a file upload form, but i have other fields in the form
21:03  Lumpio-: right
21:04  vacho: as far as data objects (array), you can serialize it and send it with ajax
21:04  Lumpio-: Unfortunately that'll involve doing trickery with frames
21:04  erichynds: you need to hack an iframe basically
21:04  erichynds: you can' do it with straight XHR
21:04  geekbuntu: vacho, that's what i'm using as my base - the ajax uses fileElementId:'fileToUpload',
21:04  erichynds: look at the jquery ajax form plugin
21:04  geekbuntu: vacho, but i need to bring in other fields along with it
21:04  ravenzz: testo http://jsfiddle.net/TWVYL/
21:04  Bartzy: Do you know if Google CDN serves files with 304 or just sets expires to the future and the browser caches it without need for 304 ?
21:04  vacho: geekbuntu: do one ajax call for the form data and another one for the file
21:05  vacho: geekbuntu: file will be ajaxed when it's attached to the form while the form data is ajaxed upon submission
21:05  geekbuntu: vacho, i hadn't even entertained that thought... it's worth a try
21:06  vacho: geekbuntu: it's worth a shot.
21:06  geekbuntu: vacho, was just looking at the spec - the 'text' has to go up with it
21:06  geekbuntu: vacho, @#$@%
21:06  albemuth_: geekbuntu check this out http://code.google.com/p/html5uploader/
21:06  geekbuntu: vacho, that would've been a nice 'out'
21:06  albemuth_: it does the sending a file + other params
21:06  vacho: geekbuntu: don't use html5 uploader since majority are not on a html5 browser
21:06  erichynds: omg
21:06  erichynds: use malsup's ajax form plugin
21:06  albemuth_: you'll have to dig into the source though
21:06  erichynds: it's legit
21:06  geekbuntu: vacho, good point (html5 isn't mainstream yet)
21:06  erichynds: and stable, and easy
21:07  vacho: geekbuntu: at least in my situation, my analytics still shows about 30% are in ie6
21:07  geekbuntu: albemuth_, thank you - i'll dig - if someone figured this out - it's the least i can do
21:07  geekbuntu: vacho, i think your stats are correct
21:07  geekbuntu: vacho, mostly i see more chrome && safari than new browsers (in my stats)
21:07  geekbuntu: vacho, thank you for the advice
21:08  vacho: geekbuntu: it depends on your demographics... my sites are mostly viewed by corporate ppl and they are usually on older browsers
21:08  geekbuntu: vacho, mine too
21:09  toomy: hi guys, ive included jquery ui from google as follows: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.5.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script> however when i apply the class="ui-corner-all" to a div, it has no effect ?
21:09  SugaSlide: 1st off thats an old version i think
21:09  SugaSlide: 1.8.7 is the latest
21:09  SugaSlide: and then.. you need to include the css file aswell
21:10  SugaSlide: to be able to use the style things
21:10  chao-mu: testo: In your code you are treating each checkbox as if it was a string.
21:11  chao-mu: testo: Also, if you are just going to operate on checked checkboxes it is possible to select only them with jquery selectors
21:11  chao-mu: Take care all!
21:11  pfn: is there a $(selector).isVisible() ?
21:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o eir]
21:11 --- eir sets modes [#jquery -bo Soonus!*@* eir]
21:11  pfn: or do I have to check css('display') ?

21:20  hauni: hi guys ... in prototype there is a .bind(this) which you can add a la function() {asdfljasdf}.bind(var) and var will be available inside the func ... is there an equivalent in jquery?
21:21  andriijas: in jquery ui dialogs,  whats most convinient, to have cancel button to left and ok to right or the other way arround?
21:21  jaql: alright, so i've found a way to add an active class to an anchor tag being clicked and remove it once a different one is clicked, but i don't exactly understand how it's doing it.  could someone explain this to me? http://jsbin.com/oxezo/edit
21:21  jaql: specifically the .not(this) part
21:23  ajpiano: jaql: it's filtering out that dom element from the set
21:23  ajpiano: it would be even faster if you did this
21:23  ajpiano: http://jsbin.com/oxezo/71/edit
21:24  jaql: why is that faster?
21:24  Soopaman: any individuals versed in css3 here?
21:24  jaql: you just put that method in a variable
21:25  Xotix: hi
21:25  hauni: never mind, solved my prob
21:27  jaql: ajpiano: is it because it doesn't have to select it again?
21:27  ajpiano: yep
21:27  Michael: Can't find a demo of webgl + stereo 3d
21:28  jaql: neat
21:28  Soopaman: is it possible to have a property within an css selector reference a specific property of another css selector?
21:29  mekwall: ajpiano: this is fonky! happy music ftw :)
21:29  amh345: hi everyone, can anyone give me a tip for pushing one div inside another?  i have two divs located in different locations, and when the page loads i need to nest one inside the other.   i think there's a way to do it with #target_div .html()  but i dont want to dump all the div code into .html().  any suggestions?
21:29  ajpiano: mekwall: i'm glad you're digging it.... especially cause you're from gothenberg
21:29  ajpiano: urg
21:29  ajpiano: which is where all the good pop comes from
21:30  mekwall: hehe, well I'm not much of a pop listener... tends to be too noisy for my taste, but this is good!
21:31  mekwall: ajpiano: I'm impressed you actually know where Gothenburg is :D
21:31  jaql: ajpiano: thanks for that tip
21:31  Xotix: i want to make a little tool, where you can add something. so i have a page. and 3 steps. like first step, your name, second step your hobbies third step, something else. i thougth, i make a div and change the html in it depending on the current step. is that a good solution? imagen that with a switch case. http://pastebin.com/tApnnqeS all the data get stored in a js array and then at step 3 saved.
21:31  JonMarkGo: Anyone know of a plugin that could emulate the menu functionality here: http://www.nyrp.org/ ?
21:31  ajpiano: mekwall: it's hard not to when you listen to the likes of jens lekman and kings of convenience
21:32  ajpiano: or hang out with nlogax
21:32  ajpiano: :D
21:32  Xotix: the problem with that is, it gets cached. al least in ff
21:32  Xotix: *at
21:32  mekwall: ah, king of convenience :) they are norwegians though
21:32  ajpiano: i know!
21:33  ajpiano: anyone who hangs on irc for a decade ought to have a workign knowledge of northern european geography
21:33  ajpiano: so many of you on it :x
21:33  mekwall: ajpiano: ever heard of nina kinert?
21:33  Trisox: ?seen hopsy
21:33  bot-t: Trisox, #jquery @ FreeNode stats by bot-t - http://bot-t.com/logs/jquery/stats
21:33  ajpiano: nope...marit bergman tho
21:33  Trisox: seen hopsy
21:33  Lampoon: Hopsy was last seen in #jquery 3 days 56 min ago saying 'lol'.
21:34  mekwall: ajpiano: nina is growing atm... she's an old classmate of mine :)
21:34  swiggy: ne one?
21:34  ajpiano: oh, i'll give a listen
21:34  mekwall: ajpiano: she's into alternative / pop, so might be up your sleeve
21:35  mekwall: and her voice is like a razor, just cuts through your skin :P
21:35  ajpiano: haha yea this is definitely in my ballpark
21:35  mekwall: ajpiano: which one you listenin' to?
21:36  SugaSlide: Trisox aparently she was sick
21:36  ajpiano: "play the world"
21:36  amh345: got it. thanks guys! :) $("#dest").html($('#target')).html();
21:38  mekwall: ajpiano: her new album is kinda dedicated to star wars, which is both fun and geeky :D
21:38  ajpiano: ah woot i'm gonna get it
21:38  mekwall: Red Leader Dream :D
21:39  Bartzy: anyone maybe knows how I can avoid the 304 responses when using cached files ? :\
21:40  skamikaze: Bartzy: $.ajax({ cache : false})
21:41  skamikaze: (or use ajaxSetup)
21:42  dans: can anyone help me with using jquery and the html5 file api?
21:42  mekwall: ajpiano: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80b2PIJofpI&feature=related <-- very good, was used by SAAB in a commercial ... that was kinda her breakthrough here in Sweden
21:42  dans: i have a file field...and i want to read in the file as txt
21:42  dans: and the operate on that txt
21:42  ajpiano: mekwall: i am 10 seconds into red leader dream now :)
21:42  mekwall: great
21:43  dans: here is my attempt: https://gist.github.com/776841
21:44  dans: at the moment i'm just trying to trigger the alert, any alert
21:44  dans: within the onload function
21:44  kanzie: Which is the preferred carousel-slider plugin for jquery today? I've previously worked a little with http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/ and liked it but it is a bit old today perhaps?
21:45  kanzie: its updated though
21:46  dans: anyone have any examples of reading a file using jquery and the html5 file api??
21:47  mekwall: ajpiano: another recommendation of a good swedish musician is Tingsek
21:47  ajpiano: awes
21:47  ajpiano: ...this one is really spot on ;)
21:48  khmer: hey guys, i'm sorta drawing a blank on something
21:48  ajpiano: mekwall, i've also been listening to a lot of hakan hellstrom lately
21:48  mekwall: ajpiano: oh I can't stand him :/
21:48  khmer: i don't think i can use .queue() because i need several elements to belong to the same queue
21:48  mekwall: he's a gothenburgian icon
21:48  ajpiano: lol
21:48  ajpiano: why
21:48  ajpiano: oh :)
21:48  mekwall: not sure, I just don't like his voice :/
21:48  ajpiano: i just heard of him 2 months ago
21:49  ajpiano: i like a lot of shitty singers though
21:49  Trisox: khmer what shape?
21:49  mekwall: he's too.... hmm whiney :D
21:49  SugaSlide: mekwall, ajpiano i hate you guys :/ i aslo wanna be sampling musicZ
21:49  khmer: http://jsfiddle.net/xXbtm/ <-- the "Design", "Categories", "Products", "Settings" sections should wait for each other to show and hide
21:49  khmer: ^^^^ but if you click two of them in short succession, you get an error state
21:49 * mekwall is not good for this channel
21:49  ajpiano: heh
21:49  khmer: i tried to implement some simple queueing, but i seem to have confused myself
21:50  khmer: it all looks like diarrhea and i'm going to kill myself right now if everyone doesn't stop their nice conversation and help me instead
21:51  mekwall: ajpiano: you know about ray lamontagne?
21:51  coachz: you better just kill yourself and make it easy
21:51  ajpiano: i've heard im, i'm not really into that like really singer-songwritery stuff
21:52  khmer: ok but before i kill myself, am i misunderstanding .queue() and it can be used here after all?
21:52  mekwall: ajpiano: well, if you're ever in need of charming a girl... he will do the trick for you lol
21:52  ajpiano: ;)
21:52  dans: no-one? :(
21:53  mekwall: dans: reading a file in what sense?
21:54  kanzie: I like this tinsek guy
21:54  kanzie: never heard of him before
21:54  kanzie: Daniel Lemma is also Gothenborg I think...awesome voice
21:54  dans: mekwall, well i actually want to read in a CSV file
21:54  dans: and populate my database based on the result
21:54  mekwall: kanzie: he's not even famous here in Sweden :P
21:55  khmer: dans: $.get
21:55  mekwall: dans: you could dissect Plupload
21:56  khmer: dans: oh, i think i didn't understand the question
21:57  dans: the problem is, i dont want to upload anything....i want it all done on client side with the html5 file api
21:57  khmer: dans: you're limiting your audience
21:57  Kambfhase: dans: MDN has good examples for reading files
21:57  khmer: dans: also that suggests to me that you're trying to generate SQL client-side
21:58  panfist: i was wondering if it was possible to clone() an element and append it to a new target, not the same page
21:58  joelt_nz: Hi guys, how do I get the value of a dynamically added form element?
21:58  mekwall: dans: that can't be done what I know
21:58  mekwall: dans: only if the user drag and drop the file onto the browser
21:59  khmer: joelt_nz: when you added the form element, what did you use to do so?
21:59  mekwall: dans: would be a security risk to let the browser access local files in any other way
21:59  joelt_nz: khmer: $.get
22:00  khmer: joelt_nz: you had an external resource send back html, which you then appended?
22:00  joelt_nz: khmer: correct
22:00  khmer: joelt_nz: when you appended it, you did so at the end of $(some).chain().append(html) right?
22:01  joelt_nz: khmer: $('#shipping_options').html(data);
22:01  khmer: joelt_nz: ok, so the way you did it does not immediately result in a handle for the form input
22:01  khmer: joelt_nz: now that it's part of the DOM, though, you can fetch it like you would anything else
22:02  khmer: joelt_nz: $('#shipping_options :input#inputID')
22:04  timmywil: ew
22:04  timmywil: $('#inputID')
22:04  joelt_nz: khmer: hmmm, it's returning undefined .... let me check my naming
22:05  khmer: timmywil: fair enough
22:05  khmer: timmywil: i offer only readability as an excuse
22:05  timmywil: =)
22:07  khmer: hey if you have time to diss my selectors, do you have time to examine my jsfiddle?
22:07  joelt_nz: khmer: ahhh, user error
22:07  joelt_nz: ;)
22:07  joelt_nz: thx for helpin' !
22:07  khmer: joelt_nz: whoever that "user" guy is, man
22:07  khmer: joelt_nz: we'll get him in the end
22:09  dans: mekwall, i have a file input field
22:09  Xotix: can someone help me here? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/adding-page-with-steps give me some input on how doing it better?
22:09  dans: khmer, yes eventually i want to turn it into sql
22:09  mekwall: dans: check plupload then
22:10  mekwall: dans: it has a html5 module and is built in jquery :)
22:10  mekwall: ?plupload
22:10  bot-t: mekwall, Examples - Plupload - A tool for uploading files using Flash ... - http://www.plupload.com/example_queuewidget.php
22:10  iEatChildren: with the validation plugin, how do i change the border color of the input when it doesnt validate?
22:10  charnel: how can I get the value in the address line via jquery
22:10  dans: mekwall, using flash??
22:10  mekwall: dans: that's one of the modules yes
22:10  mekwall: dans: they have modules for nearly everything... html5, flash, silverlight etc.
22:11  mekwall: dans: http://www.plupload.com/index.php <-- :)
22:12  dans: can't i write my own quite simply?
22:12  dans: if i'm using html5?
22:12  dans: especially if it's text, don't i have a readDataAsText() method?
22:14  dans: mekwall, something like this is what i want http://html5demos.com/file-api#view-source but i dont understand it, nor can i get it work for my case
22:14  dans: nor is it jquery
22:18 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
22:22  dans: aaah im getting somewhere
22:23  devinrolsen: is there a way to dump the html contents of one element into another element but use the .not() to discard certain parts of the html i want to dump?
22:23  khmer: devinrolsen: filter with a regex
22:24  devinrolsen: poopy
22:24  devinrolsen: ok thanks khmer
22:24  khmer: how's that poopy?
22:24  khmer: i mean, if you're just doing a string replace it doesn't even need to be a regex
22:25  mekwall: devinrolsen: the html you want to discard, is it elements?
22:25  devinrolsen: nothing, I was hopeing there was a super cool trick  I didn't know about ;)
22:25  devinrolsen: yes mekwall with classes
22:25  mekwall: then you can use .not
22:25  devinrolsen: can you show an example real quick?
22:26  mekwall: devinrolsen: show me some html code so I know what to work with
22:26  khmer: oh i see
22:26  khmer: i didn't realize!
22:27  khmer: $('#receiver').html($($('#giver').html()).not('.discard')
22:27  khmer: i don't like the looks of that $($(, but i believe .html() returns a string, so that'll elementize it
22:27  dans: YEs, got it
22:28  mekwall: khmer .... giver and reciever... not that's poopy :D
22:28  mekwall: now*
22:28  devinrolsen: http://pastebin.com/CPhAe47W
22:28  khmer: mekwall: would you have preferred "hello.jpg" and "lemonparty.jpg"
22:28  mekwall: khmer: nah, I prefer to have a laugh :)
22:28  devinrolsen: each li list item that is clicked needs to have its contents dumped into .custom-select-display
22:28  dans: this is what i was looking for https://gist.github.com/776921 - so the alert displays the contents of the file...now i just need to operate on that info and do some sql
22:29  devinrolsen: but not .account-full or .ctive
22:29  devinrolsen: err .active*
22:29  toastyghost: i really want to make some flyers that say "Learn how to avoid buying a bad car!  lemonparty.org" and put them all over town in the middle of the night
22:29  toastyghost: i think this means i'm a bad person
22:30  mekwall: devinrolsen: you don't want to dump those at all?
22:30  mekwall: devinrolsen: or just some?
22:30  khmer: devinrolsen: $('li').click(function(){$($(this).html()).not('.active,.account-full').appendTo('.custom-select-display')})
22:30  devinrolsen: AHH yes appendTo after the .not.. that might work.
22:33  mekwall: $(this).children().not(".account-full, .active").copy().appendTo might be better :)
22:33  khmer: see, i knew that was a weird way to do it
22:33  khmer: :)
22:33  khmer: thanks, mekwall
22:33  devinrolsen: sorry just one li's contents at a time..
22:33  devinrolsen: I think I might have it though thanks guys.
22:34  mekwall: $(this).children(':not(".account-full, .active")') works as well :P
22:34  khmer: although...isn't children() only one level deep?
22:34  mekwall: khmer: hehe np
22:34  devinrolsen: ahh yes you are right cause $(this) is reffering to the list item clicked.
22:35  devinrolsen: so children = its contents
22:35  mekwall: yup
22:36  khmer: mekwall: would children().not('.active,.account-full') work if the markup was <li><span class="somenewmarkup"><a class=".active">derp</a></span></li>
22:37  devinrolsen: no it will not ;) just tested khmer.
22:38  khmer: devinrolsen: right, so .not() only works on the elements in jquery's matched elements array
22:38  mekwall: khmer: .contents() ?
22:39  dans: how can i $.post(self) ?
22:39  dans: back to the same page
22:39  dans: $.post('') ?
22:39  mekwall: woot?
22:39  mekwall: ?.post
22:39  bot-t: jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
22:39  khmer: mekwall: that oughta do it
22:40  dans: yes, there is a url parameter....is leaving that blank the right way to post to self
22:40  mekwall: ?try
22:40  bot-t: do or do not, there's no try
22:40  mekwall: meh
22:40  mekwall: ?tias
22:40  bot-t: Try It And See
22:40  mekwall: :)
22:41  dans: im trying mekwall, but it doesnt seem to work
22:41  dans: which is why im asking
22:41  dans: im trying to post a variable back to the same page: $.post('', { filecontents: evt.target.result });
22:41  devinrolsen: I guess after I dump the contents of the list item, I could just run a remove over these two non needed elements.
22:41  devinrolsen: clunky but should work.
22:42  mekwall: devinrolsen: try with .contents() intead of .children()
22:42  devinrolsen: yeah I did, same result.
22:42  mekwall: that's weird
22:45  Bartzy: What's better : YUI Compressor or Closure compiler?
22:46 --- Suga is now known as SugaSlide
22:46  Kambfhase: better in what form? Code quality?
22:46  devinrolsen: mekwall and khmer, assuming we are in the click event callback $('.custom-select-display').html($(this).html()).find('.account-full').remove(); this works perfect.
22:47  Bartzy: Kambfhase: Code quality & size...
22:47  Bartzy: and overall
22:47  dans: with $.post('', { filecontents: evt.target.result }); would the correct way to access this variable be params[:filecontents] in rails?
22:47  dans: ooops wrong channel
22:48  Kambfhase: Bartzy: Closures Compression rate is better than YUIs. But it might break your code.
22:49  mekwall: devinrolsen: $(this).find('*:not(.account-full, .active)') <--- what about that?
22:49  mekwall: do a .copy().appendTo after that
22:49  mekwall: if you do get the right elements that is

22:53  dans: is this not a valid statement? $.post('', { filecontents: evt.target.result });
22:54  mekwall: devinrolsen: otherwise you can try with, $(this).children().copy().remove('.account-full, .active').appendTo
22:54  Xotix: can someone help me here? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/adding-page-with-steps give me some input on how doing it better?
22:54  Cryp71c: dans, you're intentionally not directing the post at any file?
22:55  dans: Cryp71c, i want to direct it back on itself
22:55  Kambfhase: "" would be the current URL.
22:55  devinrolsen: mekwall thanks, that worked great.

22:57  dans: Kambfhase, i presume " or ' makes no difference?
22:57  Kambfhase: dans try posting to window.location
22:57  Kambfhase: dans: niope.
22:57  mekwall: devinrolsen: cool :)
22:58  dans: nope Kambfhase, that redirects me to http://localhost/#.*$/
22:58  dans: but at least its definitely posting somewhere
22:58  fakingfantastic: Wouldn't $(window).height() - $(document).height() give me the amount of space under my #footer (given footer is the last HTML element and all that)
22:59  ngharo: is it possible to gather a list of all 'mousedown' events attached to elements on a page?
22:59  ngharo: if say i want to rebind them progmatically
22:59  fakingfantastic: ngharo: $(elm).data("events")
23:00  ngharo: $(window).data('events').each(fn) you think would work?
23:00  nathanhammond: I have an old account (nathanhammond) in jQuery's Trac install (from when it was at dev.jquery.com) that won't let me login, nor reset password. Can anybody here do something about that? I've a few bugs to file.
23:01  fakingfantastic: nathanhammond: that's why they've locked you out :)

23:02  ajpiano: nathanhammond: i don't know what to tell you except to talk to snover, or register a new account :/
23:02  ajpiano: he's not around right now though
23:03  nathanhammond: fakingfantastic: caps lock - the cruise control for awesome. ;)
23:03  Brodingo: yeah no
23:03  devinrolsen: fakingfantastic I dare you to go to the #css room and state that lol, I simply said "jQuery is the best" once and was flamed by like 5 or 6 people.
23:03  serio: no yeah
23:04  fakingfantastic: nathanhammond: i felt it complimented my ignorant statement rather well, actually
23:04  Brodingo: serio serio
23:04  fakingfantastic: devinrolsen: the statement was intentionally tongue-and-cheek
23:04  serio: Brodingo Brodingo
23:04  Brodingo: boing
23:04  devinrolsen: yeah so was mine lol
23:04  nathanhammond: ajpiano: thank you sir, I'll see if I can't track snover down.
23:05  mekwall: nathanhammond: you'd better be paying royalties to sean` for using that word
23:05  ajpiano: bot-t: tell snover a gentleman by the name of nathanhammond needs assistance with his trac account
23:05  bot-t: ajpiano, Okay.
23:05  dans: :(
23:06  ajpiano: nathanhammond do you remmeber your trac account name either?
23:06  kanzie: which plugin should I use if I want to mimic thickbox behaviour with loading a new page in a modal dialog window
23:06  nathanhammond: ajpiano: it's nathanhammond
23:06  nathanhammond: (real clever, I know)
23:06  ajpiano: and you just don't remember the password and can't reset it?
23:07  nathanhammond: I know the password, but it won't let me login
23:07  ajpiano: oh that's weirdddd
23:07  nathanhammond: I know the email address as well, and it won't send me any email
23:07  ajpiano: what is it (you can pm if you want)
23:08  mekwall: nathan.hammond@gmail.com ?
23:08  mekwall: just a guess ;)
23:08  nathanhammond: mekwall: actually, that is the only place I don't have my name
23:08  nathanhammond: :)
23:08  mekwall: hehe
23:09  nathanhammond: poor guy is going to get spammed now
23:09  dans: no-one knows how to .post() to self in jquery?
23:09  vacho: mekwall: u wanna signup for my newsletter?
23:10  mekwall: vacho: hmm?
23:10  vacho: dans: in the url field, type in your filename?
23:10  dans: vacho, or leave it blank right?
23:10  vacho: dans: ya that might be the default, RTD
23:10  fakingfantastic: so how do i calculate the space under the last elm in my Doc? $(window).height() - $(document).height() isn't working
23:10  dans: vacho, this is failing on line 7 https://gist.github.com/776921
23:11  dans: the alert above it works fine
23:11  nathanhammond: fakingfantastic: do you have to? http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2005/08/29/
23:11  vacho: dans: why not put in the filename?
23:11  guybrush: am I doing sth wrong here? https://gist.github.com/776999 -- why is req.body { 'bla[foo]': 'bar' } and not {bla:{foo:"bar"}} ?
23:12  dans: vacho, it's not a filename, it would be a route
23:12  vacho: dans: oh a route!! that makes so much sense
23:12  fakingfantastic: nathanhammond:  On small-content pages my footer doesn't reach the bottom of the window, im looking for a way to ensure it always does
23:12  dans: that bit isn't the problem i think
23:13  dans: sorry vacho, i mean its just a path
23:13  dans: but i think there is something fundamentally wrong with my statement
23:13  nathanhammond: fakingfantastic: footerstickalt should pin it to the bottom of the page if content height is too small
23:13  dans: maybe evt.target.result is not a valid thing to pass
23:13  nathanhammond: and the bottom of the content if it is > page height
23:14  dans: it seems to disply in the alert as though it were a string
23:14  nathanhammond: fakingfantastic: you also might want to fiddle with $('body').height(), iirc it is more reliable
23:14  Tprice: hey i ahev an issue with a textarea
23:14  Aliv3: guys
23:14  Tprice: when i type in it they textarea get bigger
23:14  Tprice: what would trigger that?
23:14  Tprice: like the hight just gets begger for every carictar
23:15  Tprice: **character
23:15  eternicode: if I have s=$("<span><input> blah blah</span>"), is there a simple way to strip out the " blah blah"?
23:15  dans: hmm i better try #javascript
23:15  Aliv3: do you think it would be a good idea to have a horizontal drop down site map, with different sections, and in one of them it would have like history,bookmarks, and save it in a cookie or something?
23:16  autarch: dumb question - how do I get the id of a jquery-ized element (say an .each function)?
23:16  burg: hello. is there any jquery function that converts json object to json string?
23:16  Kambfhase: autarch: $(elem).attr('id')
23:17  eternicode: autarch, this.id
23:17  autarch: Kambfhase: oh, duh
23:17  autarch: eternicode: no, that doesn't seem to work
23:17  nathanhammond: burg: JSON.stringify({object});
23:17  eternicode: from within the .each loop?  iirc, it should work. id is one of "those attributes"
23:17  nathanhammond: burg: that only works in browsers with the JSON object, but you can use json2.js to support the rest of the browsers
23:18  Trisox: http://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/oatmeal-book-20110111-133023.jpg
23:18  Kambfhase: autarch: if elem is the Dom element use elem.id if $elem is $("foo selec.tor") use $elem.attr('id')
23:18  Aliv3: trisox: wtf?
23:18  burg: nathanhammond, i know that, but i was wondering if there is any jquery function, so i wouldn`t have to include json2.js too
23:18  autarch: Kambfhase: yeah, it's a selector-returned element
23:19  autarch: $(this).attr("id")  seems to work fine
23:19  Kambfhase: :)
23:19  autarch: I just kept assuming jquery would have a separate function for getting the id
23:19  nathanhammond: burg: ah, no.
23:19  burg: nathanhammond, ok, thank you
23:20  autarch: Kambfhase: thanks
23:20  Kambfhase: np

23:22  rynop_: jqueryui datepicker q: I have a date range (from,to) - how do I get a callback on when the "to" date field has been changed? I cant bind to .change() on a datepicker field for some reason.
23:23  Aliv3: http://jsfiddle.net/V8tpc/ <- Top Left == Title, Top Right == Description, Update, Info, Middle Left == Selectiosn, Bottom Left==Map/Selected/w.e, Bottom right==Main content
23:23  blindMoe: does anyone know, off the top of their head, what the jquery plugin is called that will resize a div to match the height of its inner content?  ( I am using ajax to update content )
23:23  rynop_: I know there is a 'onSelect' option, but I'm not sure how to determine if the thing that was selected was the "to" input field and not the "from". Would like to avoid using the onSelect if at all possible.
23:25  recurs|ve: i have a jquery plugin which i wrote and went to test with jasmine (visually it works, just not in jasmine), i am getting the error fixture.filterTable is not a function in http://localhost:53052/__spec__/tableFilterSpec.js (i have fixture = jQuery(jasmine.loadFixture('table_filter'))) -- any help is appreciated, not sure what im doing wrong here
23:26  ajpiano: rynop_: you should use the onSelect callback if that's what datepicker exposes... you can check teh event.target
23:26  ajpiano: in the event handler, to see which element fired the event
23:26  Kambfhase: recurs|ve: localhost?
23:27  Kambfhase: ?paste
23:27  bot-t: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
23:27  rynop_: ajpiano, how can i get at the event.target object in the 'onSelect'? I'm looking at http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range as an example.
23:27 --- Ikamusuko is now known as Dantman
23:27  rynop_: onSelect only passes me dateText and 'inst'
23:27  ajpiano: check what 'this' is
23:27  ajpiano: rynop_ ^^
23:27  recurs|ve: Kambfhase: what would you like me to paste?
23:28  ajpiano: stupid datepicker nonstandard api
23:28  rynop_: what is the diff between 'this' and 'inst'? where can i get more doc's on WTF 'inst' is?
23:29  ajpiano: inst must be the datepicker instance
23:29  ajpiano: rynop_, datepicker has a completely nonstandard api from all the rest of the jqueryui plugins
23:29  ajpiano: you should just console.dir(inst) until you find some element references that are useful to you
23:30  rynop_: ajpiano, sweet.  yea thats whats making this simple task so hard :)
23:30  rynop_: ajpiano, thanks.
23:31  dans: how can I make $.post() actually redirect to the posted url
23:31  dans: like a normal http post would do
23:31  rynop_: ajpiano, in that example url i pasted - they are doing 'instance = $( this ).data( "datepicker" );'. My thought is that is not necessary since 'inst' is passed to the function.  I guess i can find out via ur console.dir method.
23:32  ajpiano: ya, lol, yr right that tha't swierd
23:32  ajpiano: but datepicker is the only widget that passes the instance around as a callback arg
23:32  ajpiano: sooo
23:32  ajpiano: :/
23:34  rynop_: ajpiano, ok cool. i'll figure it out then post back here (incase u care)
23:34 --- WALoeIII_ is now known as WALoeIII
23:36  dans: how can I make $.post() actually redirect to the posted url like a normal http post request?
23:37  rynop_: ajpiano, ok so as we expected 'inst' == $(this).data("datepicker") AND inst.id will give me the # of the input :)  thanks, u da man.
23:37  rynop_: or woman
23:37  joelt_nz: anyone used tablesorter?
23:37  joelt_nz: I'm trying to figure out it's limit
23:37  joelt_nz: (as I seemed to have reached it)
23:38  ajpiano: joelt_nz, not a lot :/
23:38  dans: do i need to nest a post inside a post?
23:38  initself: can anyone get this to work?
23:38  initself: http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example-spreadsheet.html
23:38  initself: it says "Edit the cell and select a cell range to paste the range"
23:39  initself: i'm doing that but it just puts the range inside of the cell?
23:39  ajpiano: dans: you need to just do window.location.href = "whatever" in the callback of your post.
23:39  apollo9: hey dans, it sounds like you might be using the wrong method altogether. What are you trying to accomplish exactly? Could you use .submit() and attach a event handler to handle another function?
23:39  joelt_nz: initself: works for me - in chrome
23:39  apollo9: or listen to ajpiano  him smhart
23:40  dans: ajpiano, thanks
23:40  dans: and if window.location.href is the back on the same page, will window.location.href = window.location.href refresh?
23:41  ajpiano: dans: window.location.reload()
23:41  dans: thanks
23:43  dans: ajpiano, problem is i lose the params i've passed to the initial post when the page reloads

23:58  `teh1: are you sure its auto? because inline could not be auto
