00:00  eTiger13: sanguisdex: that was for you, just get rid of all the irc crap
00:01  prism: hey all, I am using delegate and its working for 'some' items that are being populated by $.get
00:01  prism: http://www.webdev.ws?js=1
00:01  prism: for others it does not seem to
00:01  prism: im not quite sure what is going wrong
00:01  JRGould: ahh alerts!
00:01  prism: the code is here: http://www.webdev.ws/code/code.js
00:02  JRGould: ?ftj @prism
00:02 @bot-t: prism, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
00:02  prism: JRGould, there is only two for debug purposes :)
00:02  prism: yikes that renders badly
00:02 --- nolkyan_ is now known as nolkyan
00:03  prism: JRGould, any sites that do not render off the screen (0_o)
00:04  coldhead: way to riot, UK students
00:04  JRGould: are you on a netbook?
00:04  prism: JRGould, 1650x1080 WXGA
00:04  prism: 1050 even
00:05  JRGould: weird
00:05  eTiger13: prism: try live then
00:05  eTiger13: its a bit easier
00:05  prism: eTiger13, it was more that .delegate works but just not on one single item
00:05  prism: seemed a little perculiar
00:06  prism: JRGould, Ah ha might be my fault I am not sure ... I could not see a next button or well .. anything and it did not auto move like a slideshow normally does or on click
00:06  prism: but if I scroll up/down with my mouse it shifts correctly
00:06  _ZARDOZ: okay what have you changed in jQuery since I was last chatting now that I've skimmed through pertinant sections of my new book?
00:07  JRGould: _ZARDOZ - $ is out Â¢ is in
00:07 @ajpiano: _ZARDOZ, a major rewrite of jquery's ajax internals landed earlier today :)
00:07  _ZARDOZ: hahahah

00:10  blazedd: I have a $50 coupon for MediaTemple I am trying to get rid of (I have hosting elsewhere) I am looking to sell for $35
00:11 @ajpiano: lol
00:11  prism: ?live @ prism
00:11 @bot-t: prism, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
00:11  blazedd: Envato Bundle
00:11  blazedd: had a frient recommend I try here
00:11  _ZARDOZ: well ... that'll take it bit to get thru
00:11  youareno6: I keep running into situations were IE appears to buffer and not display text when I add it to the DOM using .html(). Anyone know a more trusted way of adding text to the DOM?
00:11  _ZARDOZ: maybe tomorrow's project
00:12  eTiger13: youareno6:  yeah, use a real browser
00:12  _ZARDOZ: use netscape 7
00:13  youareno6: eTiger13: Yeah, that's helpful. Since I don't just write websites for myself, I need to support other browsers.
00:13  _ZARDOZ: oops! I hope that didn't date me
00:14  youareno6: _ZARDOZ: Netscape 4.5 would have dated you.
00:15  eTiger13: youareno6: its kind of hard to troubleshoot code ..... when there is no code
00:15  eTiger13: ?p @ youareno6
00:15 @bot-t: youareno6, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
00:15  _ZARDOZ: I was there when SAMv3.0 had only 21 viruses (19 actual and 2 variations) what is there now 10,000's
00:16  jastor: sam bs?
00:16  youareno6: eTiger13: The code is too complex to paste. I don't know If I can simplify it and still replicate the problem.
00:17  youareno6: Just wonder if there is a buffer amount for adding to the DOM before it is displayed.
00:17  _ZARDOZ: precursor to Peter Norton stryking out on his own
00:18  eTiger13: youareno6:  how much text are you trying to addin?
00:18 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
00:18  youareno6: eTiger13: It's a small amount.
00:19  eTiger13: then its not that. there is something else causing the problem. is it just text or is there html in it?
00:20  JRGould: are you using $.html() when you should be using $.text()
00:20  youareno6: html in it.
00:20  youareno6: I'll try to replicate it in jsFiddle.net. However, you'd need to be on IE 7 to see it.
00:21  eTiger13: youareno6:  like i said, the problem probably exists elsewhere. do you have a live link?
00:22  youareno6: eTiger13: No. web app on internal network.
00:27  acidjazz: whats the easiest way to make a div background transparent but keep the inner contents non-transparent?
00:27  acidjazz: like i jsut want to the background-color to be transparent
00:28  eTiger13: acidjazz: use a class and then apply the class to the parent div
00:28  _ZARDOZ: I've had enough fun for one day, see you's in the times to arrive
00:28  thinkt4nk: acidjazz> transparent image
00:29  Dracos: alpha png bg image
00:29  thinkt4nk: yep
00:29  acidjazz: oh reeeaaally
00:29  thinkt4nk: yep
00:29  acidjazz:  png is probably more comaptible?
00:29  Dracos: elements inherit the opacity of their parent
00:29  thinkt4nk: yes, but it's the only way, in addition to more compatible :P
00:30 @ajpiano: you can also use RGBA i think
00:30 @ajpiano: but it's not xbrowser
00:30  acidjazz: graci
00:30  thinkt4nk: np
00:50  macslack: If someone could tell me why my 7 line script throws a 'missing : after property id' error that would be awesome
00:50  macslack: http://pastebin.com/6GUGNeDc
00:53 @ajpiano: pass a function rerefence, not a string
00:53 @ajpiano:         $('.hasDatepicker').datepicker( 'option',  'beforeShowDay', onlyMonday );
00:54 @ajpiano: also you're missing a function
00:54 @ajpiano: it's $(document).ready(function() {
00:54 @ajpiano: not $(document).ready({ }
00:55 @ajpiano: that's why you're getting that error macslack
00:55 @ajpiano: cause javascript thinks you're trying to make an object
00:55 @ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/ik2tk3bj macslack
00:57  macslack: ah error free
00:57  macslack: thank you very much
00:57  macslack: the explanation was useful as well
00:58 @ajpiano: :)
00:58  BoulderDave: i have a file_upload model, used so that a user can upload a .zip file into a directory... are there any file restrictions I can put on the model or form to prohibit anything other than a .zip extension?
01:01  acidjazz: any1 ever try and do a margin spacing inside a .buttonset() ?
01:03  BoulderDave: woops, wrong channel :)
01:07 --- losing_ is now known as losing
01:07 --- c4rl-afk is now known as c4rl
01:08  GoSox: sooo i have .slideUp(300); .html(data); and .slideDown(300); all back to back
01:09  prism: hmm thats probably what I need
01:09  GoSox: the effect I'm looking for is, i want the content in the div to zip-up, and new contnet to zip down
01:09  GoSox: but the  data loads instantly, then the new data zips up, then zips down
01:09  prism: you would probably be good reading the data in.. show a load or something read it into 'data' then do an animation of scrolling the div height to 0
01:09  prism: then fill the div with data and roll it down
01:10  prism: I think >.>
01:11  GoSox: can i do $(id).empty(.slideUp())
01:11  GoSox: something easy like that
01:11  GoSox: to get an animated deletion in one nice steap
01:12 @ajpiano: GoSox: var el = $(id).slideUp(function() { el.empty(); }); will pprobbaly work a lot better
01:12 @ajpiano: cause you want the animation to complete before it's emptied, i assume
01:12  GoSox: yes yes i do
01:13  GoSox: i don't understand why you're doing var el = etc though
01:13 @ajpiano: cause i want to avoid re-creating a jquery object of the same thing in the callback
01:13 @ajpiano: $(id).slideUp(function() { $(this).empty(); });
01:13 @ajpiano: is essentially the same thing
01:14  GoSox: what about the speed integer
01:14 @ajpiano: oh, right
01:14 @ajpiano: i forgot about that.
01:14  GoSox: slideUp( function { ; } , 300 )
01:15  GoSox: like that?
01:15 @ajpiano: no
01:15 @ajpiano: ?slideup#sig
01:15 @bot-t: .slideUp( [duration], [callback] ) | Returns: jQuery | Added in v1.0. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
01:15 @ajpiano: duration first then callback
01:15  GoSox: ohhhh
01:15 @ajpiano: you might not actually need to provdie it if you want the defulat speed
01:15  GoSox: i think 300 is a little faster
01:15  GoSox: than default
01:15  GoSox: but now its really not working
01:16  GoSox: http://pastebin.com/v8pnCh28
01:16  GoSox: theres what i got
01:16  GoSox: it still shows the submitted data instantly
01:17  GoSox: then it slides up, slides down, then slides up again
01:17  GoSox: kinda nutty
01:17 @ajpiano: you have to like, do things in the callback, if you want them to happen...after
01:17  GoSox: call back up the .empty() ?
01:18 @ajpiano: you don't even need the empty
01:20 @ajpiano: GoSox http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/7dytf/
01:22  GoSox: it is so hard to keep track of all the stray )}:)}:}):  with jquery
01:22 @ajpiano: no it's not
01:22 @ajpiano: i promise
01:22 @ajpiano: just be consistent, use indentation, and an IDE that highlights errors
01:22  GoSox: it is, because i'm looking at my code and i'm totally lost, as far as figuring out which ones are right
01:22 @ajpiano: and where you can, avoid lots and losts of nesting
01:23 @ajpiano: use an editor that shows bracket matches
01:23  GoSox: know of one that does that? and also does javascript, html, and php color coding?
01:23  GoSox: i use BBEdit
01:24 @ajpiano: vim!!!!
01:24 @ajpiano: dreamweaver also does all those things,
01:24  GoSox: ugh i can't stand dreamweaver
01:24 @ajpiano: textmate does all that too i do believe
01:24  GoSox: i have golive that i use sometimes to whip up quick stuff but
01:24  croby: textmate++
01:24 @ajpiano: i know me neither, it's like satan fucked a develoepr and that was born
01:25  GoSox: ok what i have is working
01:25 @ajpiano: but it does show javascript syntax errors even as you type
01:25  GoSox: i just deleted my last pair of "});
01:25  GoSox: "});"
01:25  GoSox: and crossed my fingers
01:25  GoSox: http://pastebin.com/JwFuUg0F
01:25  GoSox: that works
01:25  GoSox: is that 'good' syntax
01:26  hobs: I use vim and textmate, both of which are awesome, and no matter what ajpiano says I think there is too many got dang )}:)'s
01:26  GoSox: agreed
01:27  GoSox: agreed on your last claim i mean
01:27  GoSox: BBEdit is wicked old school
01:27  GoSox: its from the system 7 days
01:27  GoSox: but it still works well so i stick with it
01:27  GoSox: so how come my code can't just be
01:28  GoSox: $(id).slideUp(300).html(data).slideDown(300);
01:28  GoSox: or, rather than trying to transform javascript, why not make a new language from scratch. if google did that a few years ago, it would be pretty well supported already
01:29 @ajpiano: lol
01:29 @ajpiano: ok
01:29  stvs: Can I ask you guys for a quick tip
01:29 @ajpiano: guys everyone stop making jquery
01:29 @ajpiano: we're gonna start a new language.
01:29  stvs: Imagine you're creating jQuery for data processing
01:29 @ajpiano: cause GoSox doesn't like lambdas
01:29  GoSox: ajpiano: read again, if they started fresh INSTEAD of making jquery
01:29  stvs: and you need at the end of each chain to have the basic array
01:29  stvs: How'd you implement it without having to manually have literally, say .unbox() or .value at the end of every chain
01:30  erichynds: lol @ GoSox
01:30 @ajpiano: GoSox, you are operating in an alternate universe, I am here in the world where jQuery exists and explain that you don't need a new language
01:30 @ajpiano: GoSox, you need to wait for things to finish
01:30 @ajpiano: in order for things to happen after them
01:30 @ajpiano: that is what callbacks and event based programming are all about
01:30 @ajpiano: and it's not exclusive to javascript
01:30 * erichynds rofl
01:30  stvs: Anyone :P ?
01:31  erichynds: my incorrect code doesn't work; therefore, why isn't google making a new language to replace JS
01:31  owen1: using mustache, how to access the en - {keys: [{en: 'hello'}]} ?
01:31  stvs: :(
01:32 @ajpiano: owen1: mustache sucks a big one when it comes to looping objects
01:32 @ajpiano: so far as i can tell, you can't get ahold of the keyname in a loop unless you transform the object into an array of objects
01:32 @ajpiano: GROSS
01:32  owen1: ajpiano: yes, but is there a way to get the en?
01:32  c4rl: .
01:33 @ajpiano: " so far as i can tell, you can't get ahold of the key name in a loop"
01:43  owen1: ajpiano: i have this: { keys: [{ value: {en: 'hello'} }] } and the way to access 'hello' is this: {{#keys}} {{#values}} {{en}} {{/values}} {{/keys}}
01:44  owen1: so u can iterate on objects as well
01:44 @ajpiano: right, but if you want to loop an object
01:44  jeremy04: hi guys. Im having IE7 / IE8 issues with JQuery. Im using replaceWith, and in IE it tries to replace, but instead of replacing with <a href tags> it actually removes the link... Could be a security defense built in to IE?
01:44 @ajpiano: and print out "en" without KNOWING the key name
01:44 @ajpiano: ?gl
01:44 @bot-t: http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
01:44  owen1: oh
01:44 @ajpiano: that's what i thought you were asking
01:45  owen1: ok
01:45  jeremy04: Firefox Chrome and Safari are all ok, it's only IE.
01:45  hobs: who would have thought ie sucks
01:45 @ajpiano: jeremy04, are you sure you aren't just passing invalid markup
01:45 @ajpiano: to replaceWith?
01:46  jeremy04: thats possible actually
01:46 @ajpiano: i know
01:46  Dracos: ie wouldbe the most likely to try and fix invalid markup, and mangle it
01:46  jeremy04: ... hmm heres an example:  jQuery(this).replaceWith("<a href='index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=registers&Itemid=114' class='mod_login'>Register");
01:47  jeremy04: oh crap
01:47  jeremy04: wheres the </a>
01:47  jeremy04: ... :(
01:47  jeremy04: thanks
01:48  jeremy04: yep that was it
01:48  jeremy04: :-p sorry about that
01:48  jeremy04: ajpiano you saved me :)
01:48 @ajpiano: yes
01:49 @ajpiano: the spectre of made-up mysterious causes
01:49 @ajpiano: comes for us all at times
01:49  jeremy04: it would be kinda cool if IE did block js stuff like that
01:49  jeremy04: to prevent phishing attempts..
01:50 @ajpiano: would it be?
01:50  jeremy04: lol who knows

01:56  gusswakis: hi folks, when clicking on a link, I have the link highlighted and not navigate into the link.... However, when the anchor has Javascript embeded , it seems that it navigates into the link. I want to stop this.

02:02  GoSox: off topic i know, but: is it "<name> email" or "name <email>"
02:04  brimestone: is there a reason why calling a function on docment ready doesnt work without adding alert(); - if i add alert before the other function.. it works fine... but looking to skip alert
02:05  RomD: gusswakis: firstly you should use .live instead of .click so it doesn't bind the event handler to every single element
02:06  RomD: gusswakis: do you have control over the inline javascript? if possible avoid using it. inline handlers get executed before the jquery handler does, so it follows the link before you can prevent it.
02:06  gusswakis: RomD: no I have no control over the inline javascript
02:06  heauxbag: $.autocomplete(url) will attempt to update the list of possibilities from url, right?
02:07  gusswakis: RomD: any way to stop the inline handlers getting executed
02:07  heauxbag: by making an xhr to that url?
02:07  RomD: gusswakis: you could save the content of the onclick attribute, remove the attribute and execute the content later in the jquery function
02:07  RomD: I guess that could work
02:07  gusswakis: RomD: ah very good hack
02:08  RomD: $('a[onclick]').removeAttr('onclick'); I think
02:08  gusswakis: RomD: and how to restore the handler ?
02:09  gusswakis: this would work quite well
02:11  brimestone: is there a reason why calling a function on docment ready doesnt work without adding alert(); - if i add alert before the other function.. it works fine... but looking to skip alert

13:28  Kaaaaa: I can't check the checkbox
13:29  doonie: smurf!
13:29  mekwall: check!
13:30  Kaaaaa: it keeps unchecked even when you click on it
13:30  boobo: ok.. thats because the h1 and its content has a click event
13:33  Kaaaaa: I see... so, how can i remove this click event ?
13:34  mekwall: Kaaaaa: you wouldn't... because that would break the accordion
13:34 --- bnb_dev_ is now known as bnb_dev
13:35  mekwall: Kaaaaa: you shouldn't really use the accordion like that
13:35  Kaaaaa: mekwall: why?
13:36  boobo: why not just have the checkbox inside the h1 content div?
13:36  mekwall: Kaaaaa: because it's not compatible to have input fields inside the header :)
13:37  Flynsarmy: http://pastebin.com/ixgPXC6x Any idea why this gives the error "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'combobox'" ? I included all of the dependencies as stated in http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
13:40  mekwall: Flynsarmy: just load jquery ui from google js api and it will save you the headache
13:40  doonie: mekwall do you have a fallback to a local js?
13:40  Flynsarmy: mekwall: I'd prefer why it's not working instead of just including everything
13:40  Kaaaaa: boobo: inside the content div is not really want i want.
13:41  mekwall: doonie: no... I reckon that if it's down, internet is down
13:41  Flynsarmy: Would like to avoid the one or two hundred extra kb load from all the js i don't need
13:41  doonie: heh
13:41  mekwall: doonie: or at least, people would think so :)
13:41  doonie: was thinking if I should add a fallback
13:41  doonie: not sure yet
13:41  mekwall: Flynsarmy: actually you are wrong
13:41  mekwall: it's not loading anything extra, because it most likely is cached already
13:41  mekwall: that's why
13:41  mekwall: so many big sites use it
13:41  mekwall: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/jquery-ui.min.js
13:42  Flynsarmy: alot less sites use jquery ui than jquery. therefore the changes of having ui cached are alot smaller than jquery.js
13:42  Flynsarmy: in any case it doesn't answer my question
13:42  Kaaaaa: boobo: i want a checkbox visible next to the header
13:42  mekwall: because your question isn't valid.. you must have missed to include something
13:42  Flynsarmy: i know i missed an include, was hoping someone would know which - i included each dependency as stated on the jquery ui doc page
13:43  mekwall: you're shooting yourself in the foot by throwing away precious time on something so trivial that can be solved by loading ui from google
13:43  Flynsarmy: noted. do you know which one i  missed?
13:45  Flynsarmy: Figured it was probably button but included that and it didn't help
13:46  mekwall: Flynsarmy: core, widget, position and autocomplete is necessary
13:46  mekwall: that should be it
13:46  Flynsarmy: evidently it's not :(
13:47  Flynsarmy: I checked the URLs - they're all loading the correct files - no 404 errors
13:47  mekwall: Flynsarmy: try to put position before widget
13:48  Flynsarmy: didn't help
13:48  mekwall: then I have no clue but to point you to the google js api again ;)
13:49  Flynsarmy: heh, guess i don't hvae a choice
13:49  mekwall: Flynsarmy: it is better anyways ;)
13:50  mekwall: one file, minified with closure compiler that will most likely already be cached
13:50  Flynsarmy: I guess we disagree on the liklihood of a cache of jquery UI existing
13:50  Flynsarmy: but I do appreciate your help
13:50  mekwall: the more the merrier :)
13:51  mekwall: also, the extra load is negligible
13:51  mekwall: and only happens once :)
13:51  Flynsarmy: the site will be directed towards australia which for the most part have very slow connections. every KB helps. especially when a user on dialup attempts to load hte page
13:52  Flynsarmy: or one on a mobile
13:56  Flynsarmy: there a jquery CDN for the styles aswell?
13:57  mekwall: Flynsarmy: sure... http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.0/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
13:57  mekwall: well replace the version ;)
13:58  mekwall: Flynsarmy: replace base with the theme you want
13:58  mekwall: i.e. http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/themes/vader/jquery-ui.css
13:59  Flynsarmy: OK, did not see that coming. Error still occurs in Chrome 8.0.552.215 on Ubuntu with the following HTML http://pastebin.com/WnN3GCRD
13:59  Flynsarmy: Error being Uncaught TypeError: Object #<an Object> has no method 'combobox'

14:02  Flynsarmy: Oooooh, I see
14:02  Flynsarmy: In the example they created a ui.combobox BEFORE calling it :)
14:02  Flynsarmy: haha god i'm an idiot

14:15  ajoslin103: is this the right room for jquery ui ?
14:16  stevejalim: i've got a <select> with <option>s that i build from a ul in the plain document. The user picks the item they want from the <select> and hits a button, but the probelm is that option:selected always returns the first option. Do i manually have to bind listeners to the <select> to update the 'selected' attr on the relevant option?

14:20  stevejalim: it's the bit where i'm trying to get the href out of the selected option that's failing
14:20  Cork: stevejalim: what i meant is: to get whats selected you have to ask the selectbox for its value
14:20  stevejalim: ahhhh
14:20  Cork: not look for what has the attribute selected
14:20  Cork: as thats only in the html and doesn't change when the user change selection

14:54  RTPMatt: houdini: elements.children().eq(0) ?
14:56  houdini: RTPMatt: no, then I get children of elements[i], but I need his parent -- elements[i]. Well, I can take parent or May be it's better to rewrite like normal javascript loop?
14:58  RTPMatt: you can do $(this).parent()
14:58  houdini: RTPMatt: $(this) will return total html document, as I am not in event. I tries it already
14:59  RTPMatt: yeah, sorry, im not exactly sure what the issue you are having is.  i think it can be done, just not sure exactly what you need.
15:00  houdini: RTPMatt: I am also sure it can be done, but have idea how to explain it clear
15:00  houdini: RTPMatt: I found solution elements inside codition link to elements[i]
15:01  houdini: RTPMatt: correct answer $this = elements (<- this is not array any more in condition if(elements.children() > 3))

15:27  prism: hey all if I am using code to generate a menu: $.get( 'site.perl?primary=latest_info&secondary=nav',function(data) {  $('#mainnav').html(data) } ); how would I apply css to the new elements within that div
15:28  prism: calling something like: $('#submenu > li > a').first().css("background-color","#661212"); directly afterwards seems to fail
15:28  erichynds: put the rules in an external style sheet
15:28  erichynds: and they'll automatically work
15:28  erichynds: no need to use js
15:28  irfaN|work: prism, you can write css code external file
15:29  roger_padactor: hello, If i want to have the ability to override a function in a widget but give it access to some parameters whats the correct way to do that?
15:29  erichynds: roger_padactor, $.ui.tabs.prototype._someMethod = function(){};
15:29  prism: erichynds, irfaN|work that will not work for my menu, there is more than one menu item, this is simply the initilization
15:29  prism: if I use an external css file it will be static
15:31  irfaN|work: prism, write your css property rules in css file in class
15:31  irfaN|work: for example
15:32  irfaN|work: .activeMenu{background-color:#FFF}
15:32  prism: .active { background-color: black; }
15:32  prism: yes I know how css works that will not work for this menu
15:32  irfaN|work: and you can use addClass method
15:32  irfaN|work: can i see your error in live page ?
15:32  prism: ah it will work with that however
15:32  prism: sure
15:32  prism: http://www.webdev.ws?js=1
15:33  prism: latest info has the background set correctly
15:33  afeijo: how can I check if I have a function available? the function I run like this: $('#id').function()
15:33  prism: but the sub menu should also have a background set over 'latest news'
15:33  afeijo: I'm trying with if (typeof $.function=='function')
15:33  prism: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31044/is-there-an-exists-function-for-jquery
15:33  afeijo: thanks prism
15:34  prism: hold that might not actually do what you want
15:34  irfaN|work: prism, you want remove latest info background after clicked hosting tab ? right ?
15:34 * afeijo freeze
15:34  prism: irfaN|work, thats not the problem I can do that bit its getting 'latest news' to highlight after its just been laoded
15:34  prism: I can just loop over the elements with .each() to unset any existang backgrounds
15:35  prism: afeijo, this should help: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/check-javascript-function-exists/
15:35  prism: window.funcName
15:36  afeijo: even when it is under jquery as in $().function ?
15:36  prism: yes you can use normal javascript within jquery
15:36  prism: least I think you can I am still learning bits and peices my self :)
15:36  erichynds: afeijo, you could just do $.isFunction( foo )
15:42  afeijo: found it! typeof window.jQuery.fn.function=='function'
15:43  afeijo: or with erichynds suggestion ;)

15:58  Bob_Fossil: Aamir: cool thanks
15:58  crab: yeah, ok. i'll repost the question that i asked earlier:
15:58  crab: do i understand correctly that this attack is ineffective if you return a json object and not an array?

16:19  anli_: Nono
16:19  asmerkin: timing: i don't understand how to loop through the elements
16:19  anli_: But on the client side, the user must be able to specify a viewport and a scaling of the image
16:19  asmerkin: do you do it with .next()  ?
16:20  timing: asmerkin: or with .each

16:30  timmywil: closest will be better
16:30  timmywil: assuming it's tr > td > a
16:31  Brodingo: yeah closest continues going up the dom tree to find the matched element
16:31  Brodingo: parent is only for direct parents
16:31  DAElectric: AlexC_: I think parent will only search one level. where closest will continure up the tree till it finds one that is in the filter

17:25  b1lly: within the table

17:39  JuJuBee: How can I grab all inputs in a form and their values?
17:39  JuJuBee: I wish to do some validation...
17:40  diago: JuJuBee: $form.find(':input') will get all the inputs
17:40  JuJuBee: diago: can I get all inputs on a certain form with #formname :input ?
17:41  JuJuBee: #formID
17:41  toastyghost: khmer: looks similar to something i wrote recently, although i can't really tell what's wrong with it at first glance
17:41  diago: of course
17:41  toastyghost: http://redesign.ivygroup.com/portfolio if you want to use that as an example
17:41  toastyghost: the thing in the sidebar
17:42  JuJuBee: diago: like var weights = $("#addCatsForm :input").find();
17:43  JuJuBee: then do weights.each() to loop over them?
17:43  dioek: Hello, is it possible to use css selectors to match an element which doesn't contain another element as its child? e.g: all li that don't have any <table> children. I want the parent element, not the child (that is, i want the selector to return all li elements, not li's children that are not table)
17:43  diago: you don't need the find
17:43  JuJuBee: ok
17:44  toastyghost: dioek: $('li:not(li:contains(table))')
17:45  toastyghost: i think
17:47  toastyghost: no wait sorry
17:47  toastyghost: :contains is for text
17:47  toastyghost: it'd be
17:47  toastyghost: $('li:not(li:has(table))')
17:50  dioek: toastyghost: ah, has doesn't seem to be a standard selector (I was looking at the w3c selector's page), is that right? :)
17:51  jomofcw: Have a nice day all :)
17:51  jomofcw: And a nice week end ;)
17:52  toastyghost: i think it's css3-only but jquery is pretty good about consistency across browsers
17:59  VladDrac: I want to handle clicks on al a's in a certain div, e.g. $("#foo a").click(somefunction);
17:59  VladDrac: somefunction gets a rather generic eventobjects, what's the best way to get the clicked href from it?
18:00  johnathanb: $(this) ?
18:02  VladDrac: hmmm
18:02  VladDrac: ok :)
18:02  Sidhy: hrm
18:03  Sidhy: what font is best to use for header logo ? :)
18:03  toastyghost: $('#foo a').click(function(e){
18:03  johnathanb: What sorta site is it?
18:03  toastyghost: $target = e.target;
18:03  toastyghost: sorry $target = $(e.target);
18:04  Sidhy: hrm how to explain hehe ..
18:04  toastyghost: var someVar = $target.attr('href');
18:04  toastyghost: });
18:04  johnathanb: Cocksure
18:04  Sidhy: lol :) nice font :p
18:05  johnathanb: I know.

18:23  dorgan: using .outerHTML()   is there a way to get back a jquery object I need to be able to change attributes on the element before I add it to the page
18:23  tsyrak: guys, i don't see an event for when the text of an imput changes (and the input still has the focus) so what can i do instead? is there like a timer thing that would execute only when the value of my input has changed?
18:24 @ajpiano: dorgan, you realise that you don't need the html to do that, right
18:24  gmp: hey there, i've been pulling my hair at this modal dialog's styling being wonky.
18:24 @ajpiano: that's why you had the jQuery object of the select element to begin with
18:24 @ajpiano: just call attr and then append to the page
18:24  dorgan: no but i need the html if i want to clone the entire thing...change some attributes and then add the new object to the page....keeping the old object on the page as well

18:36  styol: im stumped, how can i properly target link class binLink from the highlighted input class itemHide? http://img.vishun.com/7f9ca0631797cbffa91b92c232c1197c.png
18:37  styol: there are multiple instances of class binLink so find('.binLink') doesnt work all that well and closest() doesnt seem to work in this instance
18:37 @ajpiano: $(this).closest(".bin").find("a.binLink");
18:38  styol: ajpiano: so that will find binLink only within that specific bin class?
18:38 @ajpiano: styol: closest isn't "magically find the closest thing no matter where it is in the dom", it "search ancestors until you find a match of this selector"
18:38 @ajpiano: so yes
18:38  styol: i think what you just pointed out made me realize how that item was not an ancestor
18:38 @ajpiano: yup :)
18:38  styol: now i dig :) thank you ajpiano
18:38 @ajpiano: it's the child of an ancestor
18:39  styol: right no wonder i was all confused yesterday as to why it wouldnt work, being a moron is fun sometimes

18:39  dabear: don't worry
18:39  dabear: theere are lots of people here that are far more stupid than you whne it comes to jquery

18:40  styol: dabear: thanks but sometimes i really wonder haha
18:40  styol: gnarf: thats just because, all you do is win

18:43  kojiro: firebug is your daddy
18:43  prism: basically setBG sets a background on some data that was pulled in via the $.get
18:44  prism: I think its executing to quick to actually be applies
18:44  prism: applied*
18:44  styol: kojiro: i heard it had ponies in the new version
18:44  styol: *has
18:44  prism: do I need to add a delay or some sort
18:44  prism: s/or/of/
18:44  kojiro: styol: hawt
18:45  gnarf: prism: what is "ref" ?
18:46  gnarf: and/or can you show the content of setBG (preferably on some sort of pastebin)
18:46  prism: gnarf, the above code is part of the function contentSwapOut: http://pastie.org/1365842
18:46  prism: ref is simply what was clicked
18:46 --- nbari|away is now known as nbari
18:47  gnarf: prism: is #mainnav outside of #content i assume?
18:47  prism: gnarf, http://www.webdev.ws?js=1

18:47  prism: if you click hosting
18:47  prism: latest news is not highlighted like it should be
18:48  gnarf: well, you clicked on hosting, not latest news
18:48  prism: gnarf, but 'latest news' exists for every major part
18:48  prism: its the default for each major menu item
18:49  python_guy: gmp: what was your question?
18:49  JuJuBee: diago: can you look at http://pastie.org/1365817 ?
18:49  gnarf: prism: random tip... don't use a bunch of .css() calls, instead addClass('highlighted') and define your changes in css - makes for cleaner javascript
18:49  prism: ok
18:49  gnarf: also, if you are going to use .css, you can do .css({"border-top":'...','background-color':'....'})
18:49  prism: ah
18:50  diago: JuJuBee: what's up with the escapes?
18:50  JuJuBee: sorry, it is embedded in php...
18:51  diago: JuJuBee: what kind of element is #insert_cat
18:51  gnarf: prism: so, in your "if (!secondary)" portion, you are grabbing the new nav, and the new content
18:52  prism: yep
18:52  gnarf: you may want to try in the NAV callback, $("#mainnav").find("a:first") -- use that as your "ref" for setBG(ref, 'small')
18:52  gnarf: and get rid of the setBG on the other callback
18:52  JuJuBee: diago: insert type=submit
18:53  prism: got it
18:53  JuJuBee: *input
18:53  prism: ok gnarf let me give it a whirl thank you for the tips replaced some of the css stuff
18:53  prism: is the opposite to .addClass .delClass or .removeClass
18:53  gnarf: prism: usually its best to use .addClass and .removeClass
18:53  prism: got it
18:53  prism: ta
18:53  gnarf: there is also toggleClass
18:53  prism: ?.toggleclass @ daemon
18:53 @bot-t: daemon, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/

18:54  gnarf: styol: aye -- http://r2-db.com -- its coming along pretty well
18:54  diago: JuJuBee: ok, what's the issue with it then?
18:54  styol: gnarf: already looks different then i recall
18:55  JuJuBee: diago: firebug is giving me a Break on Error for line 4085 of jQuery.js "query is undefined"
18:55  JuJuBee: Line 4085
18:56  styol: gnarf: good stuff, if you ever need help lemme know (haha thats a good one, i know)
18:56  JuJuBee: diago: but I am not very proficient with fb...
18:56  gnarf: :)
18:56  diago: JuJuBee: is there a live page?
18:57  JuJuBee: not at the moment, I can  set one but it will take a few...
18:57  diago: are you sure that escaping is correct?
18:58  diago: JuJuBee: wait...
18:58  JuJuBee: yes, but I change it to use ' instead
18:58  diago: You are grabbing all inputs not just inputs with a value
18:59  diago: JuJuBee: $('#myForm :input[value]')
18:59  diago: and use $(this).val() instead of this.value
18:59  JuJuBee: ok, let me try
19:01  diago: JuJuBee: no find() on line 10
19:01  diago: That's actually where the error is coming from
19:01  RobSpectre: Looking for a plugin that will do a keyboard navigated scrolling menu...
19:01  diago: JuJuBee: line 10 should read $("#addCatsForm :input[value]");
19:01  RobSpectre: Any recommendations?
19:01  RobSpectre: Needs to have a cursor.
19:03  JuJuBee: diago: I remove the var wieght anyway... still get error "$(this).value not a function" (using $(this).value())
19:03  JuJuBee: and changed to use input[value]
19:03 @ajpiano: $(this).val()
19:03  diago: JuJuBee: ^^

19:06  Know1edge: Hey guys, im writing a firebug plugin to attach jquery to the site dynamically so you can use the console to parse elements in the dom for testing. Is there a way to have jquery rescan the dom so you can inspect the elements, because jquery is being loaded after the site has loaded
19:07  diago: well I don't know what jAlert is and you should be using firebug (or an equal) for debugging
19:07  diago: console.log('No Go');
19:08  JuJuBee: diago: go it, was missing a ' before #.  Now when I alert (sum) i get NaN ?  why wouldn't sum be a number?
19:08 @ajpiano: styol: can you make a live demo
19:08  ryrych: hi
19:09  styol: ajpiano: yup but not before i realize further moronacy, was still using $(this.form) from yesterday and without .form on it, it works as expected, sorry about that, thanks very much for being willing to help
19:09 @ajpiano: lol
19:09  ryrych: what is valid identifier for float in .css({...}) ?
19:10  serio: ugh? float?
19:10  ryrych: serio: nope, float is a reserved word and YUI compressor complains
19:11  ryrych: also cssFloat won't work in IE
19:11 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
19:11  styol: interesting! if you have a console.log() in your code and dont have firebug open, its failsauce? i just had a works with firebug open but not closed type scenario, good to know for sure
19:11  JuJuBee: diago: figured out why, I need to narrow down my selection of inputs to only those that have numbers.  Otherwise I get the category names trying to add to a sum.
19:12  serio: styol, that's the way it works
19:13  JuJuBee: Suppose all inputs I want to sum have an id like cat_1_weight, cat_2_weight, how can I grab only those?
19:13  serio: console.log will return an error if console is undefined.
19:13  serio: do not leave it there in production code.
19:13  styol: serio: yeah makes sense just borderline curious how i never noticed that before, either that or i didnt have issues with things i thought i mightve in the past haha

19:16  diago: or just weight whatever
19:16  JuJuBee: what is the diff between * and $ there?  I tried * and it works

19:28  diago: JuJuBee: no problem
19:28  timmywil: karega: css() takes at least one param to get a particular style.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is an easy way to get all styles on an element.  You can get the style attribute on an element .attr('style'), but it won't return styles applied from embedded or external css.
