13:17  Lumpio-: Actually... I think I might be able to do without that information. However I'm still forced to hack with the internal properties because I want to change beforeShowDay without resetting the currently visible month
13:17  mekwall: Northwoods, $("#cust_search_list").find(".alphasearch2").css("width", 100); is enough :)
13:17  Northwoods: mekwall: ok thanks
13:17  mekwall: Northwoods, or rather $("#cust_search_list .alphasearch2").css("width", 100);
13:17 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 99 seconds
13:18  PeterB: mekwall: fantastic, hadn't seen that site before
13:18  Lumpio-: I wonder if .datepicker("refresh") throws the user back to the month of the selected day...
13:18  Northwoods: mekwall: actually i have to use if($("#cust_search_list").find(".alphasearch2"))
13:18  mekwall: PeterB, jsperf is great ;)
13:18  Lumpio-: I could get rid of my hacks...
13:18  Northwoods: find returns true , if found correct ?
13:18  Lumpio-: Let's try!
13:18  mekwall: PeterB, I also tried with the one with .end() in it, and that one was way slower :)
13:19  mekwall: PeterB, I'm pretty sure that removing done-classes and readding them is actually faster then checking :)
13:19  mekwall: reading*
13:19  mekwall: Northwoods, no... find returns set of jquery objects
13:20  dinosaadeh: temp01: MEEEEEEEH! I have to have rel attribute or the next/previous dont shwo
13:20  mekwall: Northwoods, if you only want to know if it exists... use .length :)
13:20  Northwoods: find().length >?
13:21  Northwoods: let me try
13:21  mekwall: Northwoods, or just $(selector).length
13:21  Lumpio-: Actually I just figured out how to get rid of all my hacks :o
13:21  Northwoods: ok
13:22  Northwoods: mekwall: alert($("#cust_search_list .alphasearch2").length); , always returning 0 , even though it exists
13:23  Bjornet: Hi I have this chain:
13:23  Bjornet: jQuery('.entry-content .wrapper-gallery.imgvisualparams').removeClass('imgvisualparams').children('img').removeClass('imgvisualparams').fadeOut(500).parent('.wrapper-gallery').hide();
13:23  Bjornet: I wonder if it is possible to prevent .hide() from hide before the fadeOut is finished?
13:23  doonie: yez
13:23  doonie: ?fadeout
13:23  bot-t: .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
13:23  unfo-: Bjornet, can't you put a callback function on the fadeout
13:24  Northwoods: it is coming through ajax
13:24  unfo-: as doonie pointed out :)
13:24  Northwoods: but i'm using live for it
13:24  Bjornet: ok Ill try that. Im novice so dont really understand the Callback idea
13:25  Bjornet: Ah I see. tnx donnie n unfo
13:25  unfo-: Bjornet, .fadeOut(500, function() { $(this).hide() })

13:27  MoreTea: Does anyone know if there is a open source implementation that looks like the new google docs? e.g. a WYSIWYG / WYSIWYM editor, that doesn't use contentEditable?
13:27  sean`: LOL
13:27  mekwall: Northwoods, I don't think you included jQuery :P
13:28  sean`: HI DONNIE
13:28  Northwoods: i have
13:28  Northwoods: the data is coming with ajax
13:29  Northwoods: its an ajax pagination

13:40  [1ur1]: I'm editting a function $.fn.foo... the first time it's called on DIV foo: $("#foo").foo({banana: 'yellow'}); That's all right... The sencod time, it's caled like this: $("#foo").foo('bar'). What I want to know is where to define the the option 'banana' in the first time, so that the second time $("#foo").foo('bar'), i can get the value of that option ('yellow')... Could you get what I mean? Should I paste code???
13:40  tomash: does anyone know how to simulate clicking on a element (let's say checkbox or radio button) with jQuery? but in a way that'll call all .click functions bind to that element? jQuery("blah").click() toggles the element, but doesn't fire up the custom onclick functions tied to this element.
13:40  Milky: Nopes
13:41  [KS]: [1ur1] if (typeof(param1)=="string") return data[param1];
13:41  [KS]: or something like that
13:41  [KS]: basically you check if user supplied an object, if not return what he needs
13:41  [1ur1]: But that "data" variable is global???
13:41  [1ur1]: I'd like it to be an attribute of div#foo
13:41  markj: typeof foo not typeof(foo)
13:42  [KS]: the what?
13:42  markj: ah
13:42  markj: didnt know you could do both :]
13:42  [KS]: [1ur1] well jQuery has data for each element
13:42  [KS]: which you can use
13:43  [1ur1]: [KS]: So in the first time, i should go like this: this.data['banana'] = 'yellow'... right?!
13:43  [KS]: [1ur1] http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
13:44  [1ur1]: [KS]: thanks!!! That might help!....
13:45  philk: I want to chain my ajax request. SO that if the first URL cannot be loaded, the second URL should be used. For that I have built a new function ajaxEx that accepts an array in the settings.url. This works, but somehow jQuery is reporting 2 errors when the first URL cannot loaded and in the second call all arguments to my error method are null
13:46  philk: code looks like this. http://jsfiddle.net/5QJkd/
13:46  ZEDDY_: so.. uhm whats wrong?  better way to do something like this?
13:47  ZEDDY_: god damn copy paste
13:47  ZEDDY_: $.datepicker.parseDate("mm.dd.yy", date)
13:47  ZEDDY_: whats wrong with that, it causes an error
13:47  ZEDDY_: uncaught exception to be exact
13:47  ZEDDY_: i used this http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/parseDate
13:48  philk: when call "$.ajaxEx({url: "file://somelocalfile", "http://someremotefile"}); The localfile cannot be found, so the method loads the remote url. The remote URL succeeds but ajax calls the error method twice for the first (local) url. Why?
13:50  philk: are there know issues with using ajax and local files?
13:50  Cork: philk: is your source file local too?
13:51  Cork: or just the target for the ajax?
13:51  philk: Cork: yes, its a local app, but running in IE so cross domain is not the issue
13:51  philk: Cork: I have allowed cross domain requests on the device
13:53  philk: Cork: maybe there is something wrong with my ajaxEx function and one is not allowed to call ajax from inside the error callback

13:58  Birliban: hi, i want to prevent an ajax url from being called from another source than the script where the ajax call is made. i already have a request id that is renewed on every request...

14:03  Birliban: ... so is there another 'trick' that can be done?

14:15  sean`: $('div').animate ({background: '#000000'}, 1000);
14:15  erichynds: but jquery ui can!

14:21  mekwall: Birliban, it's more or less impossible to prevent
14:21  Northwoods: http://jsfiddle.net/xSYND/
14:23  mekwall: Birliban, there are a couple of counter-measures ... unique request id is one of them, another is to only allow xmlhttprequest header
14:23  Northwoods: mekwall: ^ ?
14:24  mekwall: Northwoods, you should use delegate instead of live
14:25  Bjornet: hi, can you bind a keyup(right arrow) + click to do the same stuff? something like: jQuery("#trigger-next").live('click keyup(rightArrow)', function(){.....
14:25  mekwall: Northwoods, How can i pass $this in var myFunc <--- set it in the live function and it will be available in the local scope
14:26 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:27  mekwall: Northwoods, ah nvm the last thing ;)
14:27  Northwoods: mekwall: $("#cust_search,.alphaSearch").live('click',myFunc($this)) ; ?
14:27  Northwoods: obviously not
14:27  mekwall: no :P
14:28  mekwall: Northwoods, this should already be available
14:28  Northwoods:  simply like this $("#cust_search,.alphaSearch").live('click',myFunc);     ?
14:28  Northwoods: let me tias
14:29  mekwall: Northwoods, having var myFunc = function(){}; $(el).live('click', myFunc);  behaves exactly as as $(el).live('click', function(){});
14:29  Northwoods: and function(e) {} ?
14:29  Northwoods: event ?
14:30  mekwall: yeah if you use it :)
14:30  mekwall: otherwise it's not needed
14:30  Northwoods: i need it e.Pagex
14:30  mekwall: ok
14:30  Northwoods: .live('click',myFunc(e));  ?
14:30  mekwall: no
14:31  mekwall: only myFunc
14:31  Northwoods: gotcha
14:31  [KS]: live('click',myFunc); function myFunc(e) { ... }
14:31  [KS]: :)
14:31  Northwoods: thanks :)
14:32  mekwall: Northwoods, you should really read up on the basics of javascript before you dig further into jQuery :)
14:32  Northwoods: :( yup
14:33  mekwall: jQuery is a great framework, but if you don't know the basics of JS it's very easy to do it wrong (but it will work, but perform like CRAP)
14:33  Northwoods: mekwall: any good guide upon usage ?
14:34  Northwoods: with perfect examples
14:34  Northwoods: docs are insufficient
14:36  mekwall: Northwoods, there's nothing called perfect :)
14:36  mekwall: Northwoods, http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
14:36  Northwoods: thanks :)
14:36  Northwoods: i have the rhino book though
14:37  Northwoods: but never read it
14:41  mekwall: Northwoods, heh... maybe now is a good time? :)
14:41  RichGuk: If I had a closure (module pattern) that requires the dom to be ready as it need to parse some elements for values, is it best to wrap the entire thing in document.ready - or assign it to a variable then call variable(); in a document ready?
14:41  mekwall: I don't mind helping, but I've seen you've done some very fundamental mistakes
14:42  mekwall: RichGuk, doesn't matter... they both deliver the same result
14:43  RichGuk: mekwall: Well yeah, suppose it's what I prefer - just wondered if there a a general sense of which is cleaner/nicer
14:44  mekwall: RichGuk, well... wrapping it in $(function(){}); would essentially create a closure that will be run after page load
14:45  RichGuk: mekwall: That's true, cheers :)
14:46  mekwall: RichGuk, np
14:47  mekwall: RichGuk, just a rephrase... page load = document ready ;)
14:47 --- Frippe_ is now known as Frippe
14:48  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, why is document ready different from onload then?
14:48  blackspotwiggins: :)
14:48  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, I typed the wrong thing :D
14:49  mekwall: I meant document ready, but wrote page load... which is wrong
14:49  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, and you are only pulling my leg! :S
14:50  blackspotwiggins: i meant that page load is not the same as document ready
14:50  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, which was my rephrase/correction ;)
14:51  mekwall: don't eval everything i say in the js compiler :D
14:52  mekwall: eh, js parser
14:52  blackspotwiggins: heh ;)
14:52  mekwall: i'm too tired today
14:52  paul_uk: hey all, i read that you can do send json to php via ajax post like var data = { foo:bar }; data: {object:$.toJSON(data)} using json2.js but i understand that similar functionality is now in jquery.  or is there a better way of doing this?
14:52  mekwall: my brain is lagging behind hehe
14:52  blackspotwiggins: me too ;/
14:52 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
14:53  blackspotwiggins: paul_uk, $.toJSON is not present in json2.js
14:53  blackspotwiggins: there is JSON.strinify
14:53  mekwall: paul_uk, stringify?
14:53  blackspotwiggins: stringify*
14:53  blackspotwiggins: and it is not part of jquery core
14:53  paul_uk: ah k, i just did a 2 min google check....
14:53  mekwall: ?.toJSON @ paul_uk
14:53  bot-t: paul_uk, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
14:53  FinalAngel: how can i use the auto attribute within animate: obj.animate({ 'width': 'auto' }); ?
14:54  blackspotwiggins: FinalAngel, i think you cant
14:54  paul_uk: mekwall, hmm yeah i kinda figured that one out for myself ;)
14:55  FinalAngel: jquery's awesome -.-
14:55  mekwall: paul_uk, but Resig recommends using json2
14:55  mw44118: what is json2?
14:55  temp01: ?stringify @ paul_uk
14:55  bot-t: paul_uk, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (http://json.org/json2.js) to provide a fallback. jQuery does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
14:56  mw44118: anyone read jresig's ninja book?  i'm curious about what people think.  i learned a lot from his js pro tools book.
14:56  mekwall: mw44118, crockfords implementation - http://www.json.org/js.html
14:56  mw44118: I wish json had a date encoding built in.
14:57  blackspotwiggins: i think it does?
14:57  mekwall: whilst json2 will eventually be built-in to the core, Resig states the following: ""In the meantime PLEASE start migrating your JSON-using applications over to Crockford's json2.js"
14:57  mw44118: mekwall said whilst; he must be british :)
14:58  mekwall: mw44118, I'm not even a native english speaker hehe
14:58  paul_uk: as always, thanks temp01
14:58  mekwall: mw44118, but I guess I prefer using british spelling over american
14:58  mekwall: colour, armour etc :p
14:59  mekwall: even though it's against my principles to write less, do more ;)
14:59  bnb_dev: Hello ALL!
15:00  paul_uk: you know what i heard from an american, no lies..  hey what languages do you speak: them..  american.  me: you don't speak english then?  them: no only american
15:00  paul_uk: O_o
15:00  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, cookie or biscuit?
15:00  mekwall: cracker!
15:01  blackspotwiggins: paul_uk, maybe american finally completely diverges from proper english soon
15:01  doonie: hacker!
15:01  hariom: Hi, I want to ajax (get) some data on document ready. Then it should do get again after an interval. My code is working fine but it is too much code redundancy as I have $.get( ...) method called twice. First as $.get(... ) and Second time inside setInterval( ... )
15:01  paul_uk: blackspotwiggins, why would anyone want that to be the case?
15:01  bnb_dev: how to redirect to some page on click of drop down using jquery?
15:01  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, well if you ask me I'd say that cookie is a type of biscuit :P
15:01  mw44118: USA english diverged way back at the beginning; the earliest USA dictionaries explicitly chose to re-spell some words and throw out certain grammar constructs.
15:01  blackspotwiggins: it's not something i want, but it kindof feels like it's going there
15:02  hariom: How can I reduce the code?
15:02  hariom: get = GET request
15:02  blackspotwiggins: well, if you look at what people are writing on facebook/twitter + ebonics..
15:02  mw44118: hariom: why do you need the setInterval?
15:02  mw44118: hariom: are you polling for changes at the server?
15:02  paul_uk: blackspotwiggins, i better start a facebook campaign against it..  or maybe the brits should just reinvade so everyone speaks the queens english :P
15:02  hariom: mw44118: to refresh the data on my page after every few seconds
15:03  mekwall: hariom, show the code
15:03  paul_uk: we'll soon have boats with no jet fighters on them.. go us O_o
15:03  blackspotwiggins: yeah facebook campaigns usually work ;)
15:03  mekwall: or that part of it atleast
15:03  mekwall: paul_uk, well... english derive from the germanic languages to begin with
15:04  mekwall: so maybe... we should let ze germans decide?
15:04  paul_uk: mekwall, i was gonna say, all this is moot.  give it a few years we'll all be speaking chinese :P
15:04  mekwall: or... actually... the vikings... where it's said that germanic languages come from :P
15:04  mw44118: hariom: ok, the typical way to do that, like keep checking for new emails, say, is to use the function passed into setInterval to call setInterval again.
15:04  mekwall: paul_uk, we are all the same... just sounding differently :)
15:05  hariom: mekwall: setInterval(function(){ $.get( myurl, {para1:value1, para2: value2}, function(response){ do something with response}))

15:09  mekwall: hariom, var foo = function(){ $.get(); };
15:09  mekwall: hariom, then just call foo
15:09  maZtah: every <li> has a class="" with the categories the company belongs to
15:10  hariom: mekwall: let me try.
15:10  maZtah: now i got a few checkboxes with the categories
15:10  maZtah: when i category gets selected i want to only show the companies belonging to that category
15:10  maZtah: when more than one checkboxes get selected i want only the companies belonging to all those categories to be showed

15:11  mekwall: maZtah, that's the basics :P
15:11  maZtah: wow, in one line, i'm afraid this is not what i meant
15:11  mekwall: that will only work on one selected item though
15:12  mekwall: maZtah, I know what you meant hehe... hold on
15:12  maZtah: if f.e. 'cat1' and 'cat2' are selected
15:12 --- frigginSmoke is now known as seutje

15:13  maZtah: this is what i had so far:
15:13  maZtah: http://pastebin.com/gvG8fS17
15:14  maZtah: but it isn't working with multiple categories (checkboxes)
15:15  maZtah: been busy with this for hours :-)

15:18  maZtah: i did it with checkboxes instead of a selectbox
15:18  maZtah: so need to refactor it a bit first
15:18  mekwall: works with checkboxes as well if you rather prefer that
15:18  DanInMass: how do I state that variable lirel should be equal to the title attribute of an A link in an element with a class of memberlist?  I tried  var lirel = $(".memberlist").find("li").attr("rel") == linktitle  but the response is always false
15:19  DanInMass: ( linktitle gets the title info from a currently selected element)

15:22  maZtah: nvm has to change ':selected' to ':checked'!
15:22  blackspotwiggins: maZtah, i understood that if you select two boxes you only need items with BOTH of the companies?

15:26  mekwall: hariom, yw
15:27  maZtah: aah, mekwall: i meant the jsfiddle of blackspotwiggins
15:27  maZtah: that's doing what i eant
15:27  maZtah: want*
15:28  blackspotwiggins: it would be much better with checkboxes, mind you
15:29  mekwall: maZtah, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/FGhdL/4/
15:29  mekwall: it does work with multiple categories
15:29  mekwall: since I use normal selectors for the classes
15:29  mekwall: no change in the code is needed
15:29  maZtah: mekwall: if i check both boxes i don't want company 1 and company 2 to be shown
15:29  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, you have inclusive filter, i have exclusive :P
15:30  blackspotwiggins: AND vs OR basically
15:30  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, using filter because I've cached the elements mind you
15:30  blackspotwiggins: i mean..
15:30  blackspotwiggins: meh
15:30  blackspotwiggins: filter or not
15:30  blackspotwiggins: i meant logic
15:31  monk12: hey all, quick question... i have a submit handler... and it that submit handler i have an $.each, which loops through some lines in a textfield... now i want to 'return false' to make the submit handler quit... but it seems like it doesnt work in the each. im guessing cause of scope. anyone know how to return false inside the $.each?
15:32  DanInMass: how would one go about targeting an LI in "ul.test"  with a rel attribute equal to "test1"
15:32  maZtah: well, thanks mekwall & blackspotwiggins :)
15:32  maZtah: you saved my day
15:33  monk12: here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/eqtaH/ ... select "1" from the drop down and then in the text field type "asdfasdfasdf,asdfasdfasdf" (it should loop through lines in the text field and quit as they aren't numbers)... but the return false doesnt work in the $.each
15:33  blackspotwiggins: monk12, you could use regular a for loop
15:35  monk12: blackspotwiggins, true, I can go that route :). but if i were to being using a function like each, how would you approach my problem?
15:35  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, http://jsperf.com/map-vs-each
15:35  mekwall: mine is faster :p
15:35  mekwall: not by much, but it is
15:35  blackspotwiggins: monk12, im trying somethinf
15:35  blackspotwiggins: monk12, im trying something
15:35  maZtah: mekwall: yours does not what i want :x
15:36  mekwall: maZtah, woot? it does?
15:36  maZtah: 15:29:45 maZtah • mekwall: if i check both boxes i don't want company 1 and company 2 to be shown
15:36  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, exactly, the functionality was different
15:36  monk12: blackspotwiggins,  only thing i thought of is storing a temp variable in the $.each saying error occured and then out of the $.each checking for it and 'evt.preventDefault(); return false;' there.
15:36  mekwall: maZtah, ahhhh
15:36  mekwall: now I get it
15:36  maZtah: heh - my bad
15:36  maZtah: english isn't my best language
15:37  mekwall: well it's not my native language either, so could as well be me :D
15:37  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, yeah... I didn't realize that heh
15:37  Brodingo: holler
15:37  blackspotwiggins: monk12, a crude way would be to check the index it got to when returning false
15:37  blackspotwiggins: i'd refactor the whole thing
15:38  DanInMass: Can anyone please tell me how would one go about targeting an LI in "ul.test"  with a rel attribute equal to "test1"
15:38  mekwall: maZtah, did you get it with checkboxes?
15:38  blackspotwiggins: monk12, maybe use .map or similar
15:38  mekwall: <blackspotwiggins> mekwall, you have inclusive filter, i have exclusive :P <--- haha, now I get what you meant by that...
15:39  monk12: k. ill think about it. for loop quickest solution for now as well.
15:39 * mekwall is really slow today
15:39  blackspotwiggins: monk12, also substringing is not very efficient, try .split(",") for example
15:39  maZtah: what do you mean, mekwall?
15:39  mekwall: maZtah, did you get it to work with checkboxes?
15:39  mekwall: blackspots version
15:39  monk12: k thanks blackspotwiggins
15:39  maZtah: yeah, this one is working: 15:24:05 blackspotwiggins • like this? http://jsfiddle.net/FGhdL/2/
15:39  blackspotwiggins: monk12, since you are simply transforming data, you can do that with map and check the results later
15:40  mekwall: maZtah, yeah but not with checkboxes :)
15:40  blackspotwiggins: monk12, you are doing that already (in a way), as you are adding stuff to phone_numbers_out
15:40  maZtah: mekwall: i'm using this now: http://pastebin.com/7swpUyLr
15:40  DanInMass: anyone?

15:43  mekwall: maZtah, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/FGhdL/7/
15:43  mekwall: otherwise you have it there
15:43  DanInMass: ty
15:43  mekwall: maZtah, it's better to cache the elements
15:43  maZtah: mekwall: hah, which one is better, yours or the one from blackspotwiggins? ;)
15:43  mekwall: maZtah, it's his
15:44  mekwall: I just forked it for checkboxes :)
15:44  maZtah: aah!
15:44  maZtah: :)
15:44  maZtah: well, another thank you for both then!
15:44  mekwall: ah, was a missing semicolon as well
15:44  mekwall: after show()
15:45  maZtah: np ;)
15:45  mekwall: maZtah, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/FGhdL/8/
15:45  mekwall: that's the one I would prefer
15:45  mekwall: that will show all if there's no category selected
15:46  maZtah: http://pastebin.com/7swpUyLr
15:46  maZtah: this one too
15:46  mekwall: maZtah, which is alot of dom querying
15:47  mekwall: cache both the lis and checkboxes
15:47  maZtah: ahh okay
15:47  maZtah: will change it
15:47  mekwall: that's what I'm doing in my example :P
15:47  GaiusOctavius: how can I scroll/jump to the bottom of the page?
15:47  maZtah: lol, your raw examples let my main menu also disappear :D
15:48  blackspotwiggins: GaiusOctavius, window.pageYOffset = document.height - window.innerHeight
15:48  mekwall: maZtah, yeah you need to tweak the selector for the lis/checkboxes
15:48  maZtah: yeah <:)
15:48  mekwall: maZtah, var $cbs = $('input:checkbox'), $lis = $('li'); :)
15:48  blackspotwiggins: should work, typed that from memory
15:48  ranza: is the paste event crossbrowser? - and how do i get the actual paste?
15:48  GaiusOctavius: blackspotwiggins: thx
15:49  GaiusOctavius: blackspotwiggins: that doesn't work: TypeError: setting a property that has only a getter
15:49  maZtah: any reason you use var $cbs and (no var) $lis?
15:50  anli_: Hi!
15:50  anli_: How do I set onselectstart on a jquery object+
15:50  anli_: ?
15:50  anli_: I want to make text unselectable
15:51  blackspotwiggins: GaiusOctavius, window.scroll(0, document.height-window.innerHeight)
15:51  blackspotwiggins: actually you can overflow, no need to subtract the innerHeight
15:51  blackspotwiggins: (at least on firefox)
15:52  blackspotwiggins: maZtah, $lis is also a var
15:52  blackspotwiggins: notice the comma at the end of the first line
15:52  maZtah: aah, gotcha
15:53  fris: GaiusOctavius http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/01/03/scrolling-to-the-top-and-bottom-with-jquery/
15:54  blackspotwiggins: yeah, window.scroll() is much easier
15:55  blackspotwiggins: nice find tho
15:55  mekwall: maZtah, i use it as common practice to place dollar signs before any var that contain jQuery objects :)
15:55  memetic: ,o/ Any particular gotcha to look out for when cloning a li container and updating id attributes?  Inside the li container, I have a form... with a unique id, that I update to another unique ID.  However, when I insert the node into the visible ul container (append after cloning & updating IDs) and inspect with firebug, the <form> is missing.  :(
15:56  mekwall: memetic, could you set up a test case?
15:56  memetic: Everything else is appended to the ul container like I'd expect.
15:56  mekwall: ?jsfiddle @ memetic
15:56  bot-t: memetic, Create a new Fiddle - jsFiddle - Online Editor for the Web ... - http://jsfiddle.net/
15:57  mekwall: memetic, $('li').clone().attr('id', newId).appendTo('ul') <--- you do something like that?
15:57  memetic: It's rather complex, because there are lots... and lots of elements in the hidden ul/li container template I use.
15:58  mekwall: memetic, well... try to create a minimal test case that can reproduce the problem
15:58  mekwall: otherwise it's really hard to help
15:58  memetic: But yeah, I clone, then do things like $(record_data).find('...').attr('name', 'whatever_new_id_' + data.id); ... .attr('id', 'whatever_new_id_' + data.id);
15:59  memetic: Sure... I guess I should be more specific in my question:  What conditions would cause a form node (or any node) not to be copied over when appending?  Duplicate id attributes?
16:00  memetic: err tag, whatever, I think of the dom as a bunch of nodes :p
16:01  mekwall: memetic, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/f8D2n/
16:01  mekwall: something like that?
16:02  mekwall: memetic, well... clone would clone the whole node including the children nodes
16:02  mekwall: memetic, so you must be doing something wrong when changing/appending the clone
16:02  memetic: It does, but for whatever reason... strips out the form, and leaves the children of the form in place.
16:03  mekwall: memetic, well... as you can see in my test case, the form element is there :P
16:03  mekwall: even after the clone
16:03  memetic: yeah
16:03  mekwall: memetic, so it's pebkac :)
16:04  mekwall: memetic, my recommendation is that you start by cloning... don't do any changes to the cloned node... and go from there :)
16:06  sanguisleft: how do I use the dom value clientHeight as a variable in jquery?
16:07  mekwall: sanguisleft, like any other var?
16:08  mekwall: sanguisleft, you should use $(document).height and .width width instead
16:09  mekwall: since the html engines have different box models the values of clientHeight and clientWidth will be different
16:10  mekwall: sanguisleft, and I meant $(window).height & .width
16:10  mekwall: sry :P
16:11  temp01: height()
16:11  temp01: width()
16:11  mekwall: temp01()
16:12  sanguisleft: mekwall: so var foo = $(this).$(document).height; ?
16:12  mekwall: sanguisleft, .height()
16:12  mekwall: sanguisleft, hrm... var foo = $(window).height();
16:13  GaiusOctavius: fris: thx. That's great :)
16:13  mekwall: I am greedy today
16:14  mekwall: sanguisleft, what is _this_ btw?
16:27  anli_: I fail to make text unselectable, using the tip on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/924916/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-div-unselectable
16:29  klusias: hello. how is possible to remove <option>'s from <select>, except first?
16:31  Clonix: klusias: something like $("option[value!=firstValue]", $select).remove();
16:31  ralphholzmann: klusias: $('select option:not(:first')').remove();
16:31  klusias: thanks
16:31  Clonix: ow use ralphholzmann, is better
16:32  shirow: This is probably really simple but I can't find a function for it.. if I have an array and I shift it, how can I renumber all the elements in the array so it starts from 0 again?
16:32  ralphholzmann: shirow: afaik javascript doesn't require reindexing an array
16:32  ralphholzmann: but perhaps you're working with an object?
16:32  ralphholzmann: in that case it would need reindexing
16:32  shirow: how do I reindex it?
16:33  rmurphey: shirow: can you show an example of your code?
16:33  shirow: yes
16:33  memetic: mekwall: Well... it does not work when the form is inside a table, which is likely how it should work I guess.
16:33  temp01: ?eval arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]; arr.shift(); arr[0]
16:33  bot-t: temp01: b
16:33  mrNeeon: Is there a simple way to add an id to each LI? Now i'm using an each loop to add item-1 item-2 etc...
16:34  shirow: rmurphey: http://pastebin.com/A3uFy5c7
16:34  jqp: i'm trying to trigger a function after encountering a 404 error for an ajax request, but i can't figure out what i've got wrong in my .ajaxError handler here: http://jsfiddle.net/pzrbT/.  why is the 'xhr' object empty?
16:34  temp01: mrNeeon: why would you want to do that?
16:36  serio: initially I was like "well, adding an id would be simple enough"
16:36  mrNeeon: temp01: i want an uniq ID for each of them
16:36  serio: but then after thinking about it, temp01's question is very valid
16:36  temp01: mrNeeon: yes but why
16:36  rmurphey: shirow: you know you are pushing an array onto your array, not two items, right?
16:36  shirow: yea
16:36  mrNeeon: because
16:36  serio: because why?
16:36  mrNeeon: it's easy to keep track of them
16:36  mrNeeon: why all the questions
16:36  shirow: I need to take all the values of 'current' and shift them down by 1
16:36  shirow: maybe i'm looking at it wrong
16:37  rmurphey: mrNeeon: because we're tyring to help and we've been doing this for a while
16:37  serio: well, why not just put id's on them to begin with, outside of JS?
16:37  mrNeeon: serio: because, i want minimal markup....
16:37  serio: ugh
16:37  temp01: shirow: why are you adding 'current'? why not just use the array index?
16:38  serio: so you throw arbitrary code into JS instead?
16:38  shirow: temp01: I have to have a value in there, i'm using it for flot
16:38  jqp: flot <3<3<3
16:39  mrNeeon: So.. there are no other way then doing an each loop?
16:39  temp01: shirow: oh then you have to loop and do it manually
16:39  shirow: blech
16:39  shirow: figured.. thanks
16:39  saml: hey, after .each() can I have a callback?
16:39  serio: you can add ID's in your html markup, that's the most logical way
16:39  temp01: saml: if you're doing asynchronous stuff inside the .each(fn) then use the callback for that
16:39  jqp: saml: check if the index in your function matches the length of the thing you're iterating over
16:39  mrNeeon: serio: as i said.. i don't want to do that... what if i have an list of 25 items?
16:40  serio: thing is, there's not much point in adding id attributes afterwards, unless you need each li to have a uinique id for an ACTUAL reason
16:41  mrNeeon: i need it for a reason.. i want to hide all, then jump back and forward within them, then sort them etc..
16:41  jqp: saml: perhaps something like $.each(items, function(index, item){if(index == items.length)doCallback();});
16:42  serio: mrNeeon, you can do that sort of stuff without giving them all a unique ID
16:42  mrNeeon: never mind that i asked...
16:42  jqp: saml: does that make sense?
16:43  temp01: jqp: .. that's the same as $.each(items, fn); doCallback();
16:43  serio: mrNeeon, you already know how to do it with .each and .attr I assume?
16:43  saml: jqp, i don't know. i don't think i need that... this form adds and removes some fields.. and i was thinking it was a good idea to pass max number of possible fields to the server
16:43  jqp: temp01: i've run into problems with IE where that approach doesn't execute as expected
16:43  mrNeeon: yes
16:44  mrNeeon: that's what i've been saying
16:44  temp01: jqp: ... there's no difference
16:44  saml: let's say you have multiple   <input name="foo"> <input name="bar">   only one of foo or bar is required.
16:44  saml: so, I can't just send foo=&bar=something&foo=another&bar=
16:45  saml: so, is the only way....    foo-1=&bar-1=something&foo-2=another&bar-2=   ?
16:45  mekwall: jqp: using if-statements without brackets is a bad habit in JS
16:46  jomofcw: <input name="foo[]">
16:46  jomofcw: saml ^
16:46  jomofcw: try that and juste see the result :)
16:46  jomofcw: just
16:46  oodavid: saml: use [], can even nest them
16:46 * saml googles for []
16:46  oodavid: <input name="one[two][]" />
16:47  serio: handy for grouping things
16:47  saml: you mean [] are valid characters for name attribute?
16:47  oodavid: saml: google for form post array
16:47  saml: oodavid, thanks
16:47  oodavid: saml: yeah, your server will parse them into an object / array
16:48  jqp: temp01: there shouldn't be a difference, but i've had problems where IE doesn't wait for function A to finish before starting a function B, even though B is on the line after A.  that approach with index solved the issue.
16:48  oodavid: still need serialising though if you're building an string for ajax
16:48  saml: but.... how would you zip it?  to construct an object (in server), i need one or both of "foo" and "bar" parameters.
16:48  saml: it's hard to pair foo and bar
16:49  saml: if a user skips a foo here and a bar there.
16:49  mekwall: http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lawzzdFrDA1qd05ovo1_400.jpg
16:49  oodavid: then you can numerate them
16:49  saml: oodavid, so, like foo-1, bar-1....
16:49  oodavid: (or index)
16:50  serio: mekwall, wtf?
16:50  oodavid: foo[0]=hello&bar[0]=world&foo[1]=&bar[1]=missingfoo
16:50  mekwall: serio, awesome eh? now even "real" women can dive
16:50  mekwall: serio, if they can unstuck themselves from the beach that is
16:51  saml: oodavid, and in sever, when you getParameter("foo"), it'll return an array with holes ?
16:51  serio: holes?
16:51  saml: foo[1] is empty
16:51  maZtah: mekwall: http://pastebin.com/QF9hCdmi - how would you change this so that on load all the checked boxes gets scanned?

16:55  progrock: oh.. actually meant left anf top.. not height and width
16:56  oodavid: saml: you can group them in other ways
16:56  progrock: and it works in FF without.. but I dont know if thats just ff, ot if its safe in any browser
16:56 * saml reads http spec
16:58  progrock: I tried reading through the jQuery source to see if it was doing Math.floor within it... but didn;t see it.. so, just trying to figure out if gfractions are widely supported, or if they ar ebad news
16:59  mekwall: ?source Math.floor
16:59  bot-t: mekwall, No results found for "Math.floor".
16:59  mekwall: :)
16:59  mekwall: progrock, did you really read it through to check that?!
16:59  progrock: yeah, I esentially did that.. but also went through the css() functions and the ones it called
16:59  mekwall: heh
17:00  progrock: its always good to look through the source a little.. learn a thing or two
17:00  jonclark: after doing a $.post i want to return a string that will be the name of a callback function that will run after the post succeeds. i've tried calling it using window[callback](); but with no luck. am i fundamentally misunderstanding something?
17:01  jonclark: it says window[callback] is not a function, even after i console.log(callback) and get the string i sent back
17:01  progrock: jonclark: umnm, doesnt .post have abuilt in callback?
17:02  serio: success: function
17:02  mekwall: complete: and error: as well
17:02  maZtah: mekwall: is there a way to count the total matched companies too?
17:02  serio: "success is called if the request succeeds. It is passed the returned data, a string containing the success code, and the XMLHttpRequest object"
17:02  serio: so, you check the returned data
17:02  sean`: Think it will be heavy to bind a click event to the document and trace on which element (based on offset) it triggered?
17:02  serio: and do your ish depending on what it is.
17:03  sean`: all elements are in a jq object
17:04  jonclark: progrock: you're right. i'm trying to call the dynamically named callback from within that success function, since there's a general thing that i want all of these $.posts to do
17:04  maZtah: $lis.length always returns the total <li>'s

17:06  progrock: My function that deletes all trailing whitespace on file save is just not doing its jsut for .js files
17:07  progrock: jonclark: stupid question, but does JS have a form of 'variable variables' to allow you to do that easy?
17:08  jonclark: progrock: after reading up on it, it seems like window['someFunc']() should call someFunc()
17:08  jonclark: and when i hardcode in an example function name that works. just doesn't take a variable
17:09  Cork[home]: or you can juse do var something = somefunction; something();
17:09  jonclark: actually that's a lie, it didn't work
17:09  progrock: jonclark: hmm.. weird.. i think that should be right: http://www.i-marco.nl/weblog/archive/2007/06/14/variable_variables_in_javascri
17:09  Cork[home]: jonclark: that should work
17:10  salvo: Alguem BR ?
17:10  temp01: jonclark: window['someFunc']() executes global someFunc
17:10  Cork[home]: ?eval function test() { return 'hello'; }; this['test']()
17:10  bot-t: Cork[home]: hello
17:10  temp01: jonclark: if someFunc() isn't global, it will not work
17:11  progrock: So. I made a throwback animation (stemming frmthe old school mouse trailing scripts), gotta fix a few small bugs, but its pretty functional: http://www.montev.com
17:11  Rinthe: anyone?
17:11  jonclark: temp01: i have defined it globally, but would calling from within a success function make it inaccessible?
17:11  temp01: no
17:12  mekwall: I call it a day...
17:12  temp01: does window.someFunc() work?
17:12  jonclark: Rinthe: you can take a look at the scrollTo plugin if you're looking for something fancy
17:12  progrock: jonclark: nope.. unless you defined the local var with the same name ;)
17:12  mekwall: cya later or tomorrow
17:12  Rinthe: jonclark: no just a simple task
17:12  Rinthe: jonclark: just want to know which function to do this easiest
17:12  jonclark: Rinthe: using HTML.
17:12  Rinthe: no i want an animation jonclark
17:13  Rinthe: that moves it down
17:13  jonclark: then try scrollTo
17:13  Rinthe: thank you
17:13  jonclark: (the plugin)
17:13  Rinthe: oh..
17:13  serio: fuck scrollTo
17:13  Rinthe: theres no function that does that?
17:13  serio: there is
17:14  serio: it's called animate
17:14  jonclark: temp01: window.someFunc() still comes back as 'is not a function'
17:14  jonclark: i think i'm misunderstanding some scope thing..
17:14  temp01: then it isn't global
17:15  serio: Rinthe, $( 'html,body' ).animate( { scrollTop: $target.offset().top }, 1000 );
17:15  serio: (instead of scrollTo plugin)
17:15  mekwall: temp01, when do you usually sleep? according to the logs you are as active any hour of the day :)
17:15  Rinthe: serio: much better :) thanks!
17:16  temp01: mekwall: never!
17:16  mekwall: temp01++
17:16  jonclark: temp01 is a bot, didn't you know? :P
17:16  salvo: Alysson_Marques, BR?
17:17  serio: temp01 will sleep when he's dead
17:17  Alysson_Marques: yes
17:17  danheberden: temp01 is the jane of ender's game
17:17  danheberden: but... a dude
17:18  mekwall: jonclark, evolution of bot-t? :)
17:18  jonclark: i fear for the planet if bot-t evolves any further
17:19  Alysson_Marques: Why?
17:19  salvo: Alysson_Marques, brazil?
17:19  Cork[home]: terminator next huh? :D
17:20  Alysson_Marques: Yes, Rio Grande do Sul :)
17:20  mekwall: jonclark is actually john connor
17:20  salvo: Alysson_Marques, maravilha! precisando de um help.
17:20  Rinthe: serio: http://codepad.org/oVZro631 this is not working any ideas?
17:20  mekwall: I believe that clark is one of those undercover names
17:20  Alysson_Marques: kkkk
17:21  salvo: Alysson_Marques, penando aqui pra descobrir o erro no IE. maldito ie
17:21  serio: Rinthe, you're calling animate on $(this), which is not what I said, are you trying to scroll down the page?
17:22  Rinthe: serio: yes, i am
17:22  serio: $( 'html,body' ).animate
17:22  Alysson_Marques: vixi, IE eu não sei não :/
17:22  serio: not, $( this ).animate
17:23  Rinthe: serio: ahh there we go
17:23  Rinthe: i thought..
17:23  Rinthe: nm
17:23  Rinthe: thanks
17:23  serio: works?
17:23  Rinthe: serio: yup! perfect. thank you!
17:23  serio: np
17:23  salvo: Alysson_Marques, fiz um simples .css("display", "none"); num <tr> pra ele exibir uma linha qnd o botão for clicado e n funfa no IE.
17:23  Cork[home]: you might want to have a look at the scrollTo plugin, its really nice
17:23  salvo: no resto funciona. rsrsrsrsrs
17:25  Rinthe: serio: how can i give a more room, meaning scroll a little less than what its doing
17:25  Rinthe: something with offset().top?
17:25  serio: offset().top - whatever
17:25  Alysson_Marques: hm, deixa eu ver se encontro alguma coisa a respeito
17:25  serio: + whatever
17:25  Rinthe: ok thanks
17:25  serio: that will change the distance
17:25  serio: 1000 = speed
17:25  Rinthe: distance in pixels?
17:26  serio: yes,
17:26  salvo: Alysson_Marques, nao sei se por conta de ser tabela, da pau no IE.. preciso testar com div ve se funciona. o incrivel é q nenhuma erro aparece.
17:26  Rinthe: serio: great it worked thanks
17:27  jonclark: progrock & temp01: got it working
17:28  jonclark: thanks for the help :)
17:28  Rinthe: http://codepad.org/lJuymJY6 i have this for binding my "c" to focus onto the comment area right now. the problem is everytime i try to copy something on the page (control+c) it goes to the comment box, quite annoying. how can i do a check for if any other keys are pressed down?
17:29  ajpiano: event.ctrlKey
17:29  ajpiano: event.altKey
17:29  ajpiano: etc
17:30  Alysson_Marques: talvez o seu código não esteja errado, oque deve estar acontecendo é que alguma string esta impedindo o seu funcionamento
17:30  Rinthe: ajpiano: is there a check for if ANY key is held down?
17:30  salvo: Alysson_Marques, por exemplo?
17:30  ajpiano: if (event.ctrlKey || event.shiftKey || event.altKey) { }
17:31  ajpiano: Rinthe: that's the part where "knowledge" meets "application"
17:31  Alysson_Marques: poderia me dar mais detalhes sobre oque vc esta tentando fazer?
17:31  salvo: Alysson_Marques, sim claro.
17:31  Rinthe: ajpiano: haha i meant all keys on the keyboard but i guess i don't really need it. thanks i will try that :)
17:31  ericinohio: I have a modal, the controls behind it bleed through in browsers..i know theres a jquery plugin to fix it, anyone remember the name?
17:31  salvo: Alysson_Marques, eu tenho uma tabela q lista registros vindo do banco de dados.
17:31  Alysson_Marques: desculpa a demora a responder, estou almoçando! ^^
17:31  ajpiano: Rinthe: all the keys on the keyboard?
17:31  ajpiano: wtf
17:31  ajpiano: anyway
17:32  Rinthe: no
17:32  Rinthe: i dont need to do that
17:32  Rinthe: i realized

17:32  salvo: Alysson_Marques, e possuo um <select> q traz alguns filtros para exibir registros...
17:32  Rinthe: rofl
17:32  Rinthe: they really need it
17:32  danheberden: perhaps 'all' - like 'any'
17:32  thestream: how do you use json to request a string from a php file?
17:32  danheberden: if a keyboard event is fired
17:33  kanzie: I have a live-change event tied to a select-element but when I click the option-elements in the select it does not trigger in Internet Explorer, but works ok in other browsers
17:33 --- rwaldron is now known as rwaldron_busy
17:33  Rinthe: dannheberden: yea i meant any :p
17:33  kanzie: should I tie it to the options instead?
17:33  salvo: Alysson_Marques, ao ser clicado em algum <option> desse <select>, eu dou um display none na <tr> da minha tabela, exibindo o campo desejado.
17:33  Cork[home]: thestream: normallt you don't, you send the request as params, and reseave the responce as json
17:34  thestream: i am very new to this json term, but i have a php file with an array and it echos a string at random how can i pass that to a javascript viable?
17:34  danheberden: kanzie: what version of jquery?
17:34 --- Killswitch_ is now known as Killswitch
17:35  serio: ajpiano, where's the any key?
17:35  danheberden: keyCode == ∞
17:35  kanzie: danheberden: 1.4.2, bchanging to delegate now and tying it to option-elements in the select
17:35  ajpiano: serio: if (event.keyCode) { }
17:35  ajpiano: :D
17:35  ajpiano: kanzie: there are some known issues with live change in ie on selects in 1.4.2, tried 1.4.3
17:36  Cork[home]: thestream: $.getJSON('/your/url.php', { your: data, here: now }, function(responce) { alert(responce.your_variables); });
17:36  kanzie: ok
17:36  kanzie: ajpiano: ok, thanks
17:36  danheberden: thnx ajpiano - trying to work and irc at thesame time
17:37  danheberden: brain is melting :/
17:37  Rinthe: ok if (event.ctrlKey || event.shiftKey || event.altKey) alert('test'); looks like this works in chrome but not FF
17:37  Rinthe: ok it works in web-kit browsers
17:38  serio: it should work in FF too
17:38  Rinthe: serio: its not tho
17:38  kanzie: ajpiano: hmm..now that I look at it, I realize I was running 1.4.3 all along
17:38  kanzie: bummer

17:39  serio: sweet jesus
17:39  serio: are you using e or event?
17:39  serio: make up your MIND
17:39  Rinthe: oh shit.
17:39  markj: heh
17:39  Rinthe: yea i really need to
17:40  serio: I use e
17:40 * serio pops some more
17:40  Rinthe: haha
17:40  Rinthe: alright now it works. thanks guys!
17:41  markj: webkit must be extremely forgiving
17:41  Rinthe: yeah
17:41  serio: haha
17:41  Rinthe: even IE was working
17:41  serio: weird.
17:41  temp01: other browsers have a global event object
17:41  Rinthe: amazing
17:41  Rinthe: yup
17:41  markj: if serio made it you'd of been slapped around the face
17:41 * Cork[home] doesn't understand how that could ever work in webkit
17:41 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:41  serio: temp01, I did not know that.
17:41  temp01: opera and webkit create a global event obejct to emulate IE
17:42  matt1982: hey when adding dynamic elements to a form should they automatically submit or is there something else I should do? I checked and the elements are within the form tag but nothing appears when I print out the form variables server side
17:42  temp01: ditto for IDs
17:42  serio: FF is more stringent then?
17:42  temp01: yea
17:42  serio: I wonder why FF doesn't do the same.
17:42  Cork[home]: its a waist
17:42  temp01: lol waist
17:42  serio: waste?
17:43  Cork[home]: opps :x
17:43  Cork[home]: ya
17:43  serio: There must be some intelligent way of doing it without it being too cumbersome
17:43  serio: otherwise chrome wouldn't do it.
17:43  temp01: wat
17:43  serio: cuz like, google's all efficient and stuff
17:44  serio: but if they're just adopting the webkit standard,
17:44  serio: I guess there's no changing it.
17:44  Cork[home]: serio: google is speed efficient, they don't always care about memory useage
17:45  temp01: memory is so 1990
17:45  Cork[home]: lol
17:45  Cork[home]: its all in the cloud huh?
17:45  temp01: it's all on google servers
17:46  serio: which are a bunch of clones from 1990 :D

17:49  kanzie: yeap, its official...I cant get the event to fire in IE (any version), works like a charm in FF and Chrome
17:49  kanzie: http://pastie.org/1253009
17:49  kanzie: I tried both live('change') and delegate('option','click')
17:49  kanzie: any takers?
17:49  kanzie: jQuery 1.4.3
17:49  bertrand_: the live change event?

17:53  Hopsy: is a selector @ Brodingo
17:53  Hopsy: i think so
17:53  bertrand_: kanzie: I've had problems when I've used a class selector, but not a id selector... wom
17:53  kanzie: bertrand_: yeah, but I tried with the ID first. Tied it to the select-element, again worked in FF but not in IE
17:53  Brodingo: its used in some module js files for drupal
17:53  Brodingo: and i htink its messing up my site, quite annoying
17:54  serio: @ is deprecated
17:54  Hopsy: bot-t: tell SugaSlide are you in for a pizza?
17:54  bot-t: Hopsy, Okay.
17:54  serio: as attribute selector
17:54  Brodingo: i keep getting this: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [@Name='og_selective']
17:54  oralo: whats the css selector for "all fields in the form.event-detail". something like form.event-detail:input?
17:54  serio: just use  [name='og_selective']
17:55  Brodingo: im not using it, its a contributed module
17:55  bot-t: (37 secs ago) <Hopsy> tell Brodingo haii
17:55  erichynds: oralo, yeah
17:55  Hopsy: Brodingo: remove that @
17:55  Brodingo: so i have to go root around in that shit
17:55  erichynds: oralo, just with a space before the :input

17:56  Hopsy: Rinthe: ?
17:56  Brodingo: console isnt giving me a link or line number either, this is seriously the worst
17:56  erichynds: HarryPitfall, that doesn't capture textareas, selects, etc
17:56  Rinthe: wrong channel
17:56  bertrand_: kanzie: select1 works in IE 8 http://www.jsfiddle.net/x8pzH/1/
17:56  Hopsy: Brodingo: you are doing something weirds
17:56  serio: Brodingo, just do a find/replace, how hard is that?
17:56  HarryPitfall: is :input a special kind of selector?
17:56  Hopsy: Rinthe: with channel was it supposed to sent?
17:56  serio: or, better yet, stop using old plugins :)

17:57  Brodingo: im working on a site second hand, the lead dev who was sloppy as fuck left all this stupid shit and now i have to clean it up ARGH
17:58  Brodingo: if i understood what the modules did id be a little less reticent about going in and editing them
17:58  ajpiano: Treffynnon, only images frames and scripts have load events, so that doesn't work
17:58  Treffynnon: ajpiano: is there a way to get it to work instead of using .load?
17:59  ajpiano: setting data to an object dosen't work ?
17:59  serio: Brodingo, Drupal sucks
17:59  Brodingo: drupal is ok, this particular site sucks balls
18:00  Brodingo: CMS's suck
18:00  serio: some are dope.
18:00  serio: I like ExpressionEngine
18:00  Brodingo: never used it
18:00  Dracos: expressionengine is junk
18:01  serio: everyone's gonna hate on something :)

18:02  nvictor: ajpiano: how?
18:02  serio: with css?
18:02  ajpiano: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-myballs"></span>
18:02  bluegene: hi there. is it possible to select the first sibling of a node (which i identified using $("span:contains('Street'))) that has a (grand-..*)child node of the type "input"?

18:04  Dracos: try these icons: http://dracos.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2xk6w6

18:08  progrock: anyone know if the HTML5Boilerplate asynch google analytics is still up to date (or jshould I jsut go with google's code)
18:08  serio: you successfully removed all the @'s Brodingo?
18:08  Brodingo: yes
18:08  Brodingo: and it unbroke my site
18:08  Brodingo: fucking organic groups module eat shit and die
18:09  serio: that's the thing I hate about drupal
18:09  serio: so many shitty modules
18:09  Soothsayer: how do i check if two jquery objects are the same?
18:09  serio: that consume like all the memory
18:09  Soothsayer: as in they refer to the same DOM element
18:09  Soothsayer: like
18:09  Soothsayer: if( visibleBox.eq(0) === showBox.eq(0) )
18:09  ajpiano: you have to compare the dom eleems
18:09  ajpiano: visibleBox[0] === showBox[0]
18:10  ajpiano: or .get(0)
18:10  Brodingo: the guy that built this site is a great PHP developer, but he really mucked up this drupal install
18:10  Brodingo: very frustrating
18:10  fission6: i am trying to find all image urls on a page and embed them as formal <img> any code snippets on hand to do this?
18:10  Soothsayer: ajpiano: thanks
18:10  serio: fission6, how do you know if it's an image url?
18:11  fission6: if it ends in an image file format, and yes i know this doesn't cover url rewrites
18:11  nvictor: ajpiano: my icons do not look like in the example
18:11  ajpiano: sorry bro
18:11  ajpiano: :(
18:11  serio: fission6, just sayin' :D
18:11  fission6: i also want to take all you tube links and embed them as video vs just having the link
18:11  nvictor: ajpiano: they don't have the rounded box
18:11  blackwhite: hi all I want to update a database parameter by clicking a link and return the new value. I have two pages one which displays the html and the other (php) which takes the data (by using get) and does some checks and then updates the database
18:12  serio: fission6, I've done the youtube thing before
18:12  fission6: do you have / or have seen code i need
18:12  fission6: serio: you got a code snippet i can bum?
18:12  ajpiano: nvictor: the icons have nothing to do with a rounded box?
18:12  blackwhite: can i use get() in jquery instead of link.php?param1&param2&param3
18:12  serio: it was in php, I'm sure you can google around
18:12  nvictor: ajpiano: but i want them?
18:12  ajpiano: nvictor: i want a pony
18:13  ajpiano: i don't know what "rounded box" you're talking about
18:13  ajpiano: but the icons css has nothing to do with border-radius on the element
18:13  nvictor: ajpiano: the url you've given
18:13 --- mfer is now known as mfer-lunch
18:13  Cork[home]: blackwhite: are you talking about ajax calls, or?
18:13  nvictor: ajpiano: it has icons on nice boxes
18:13  blackwhite: Cork[home] yes
18:13  ajpiano: i think some of those aren't officially released yet nvictor
18:14  nvictor: ajpiano: oh
18:14  serio: I WANT A UNICORN!
18:14  serio: :(
18:14  Cork[home]: blackwhite: you can add your parameters to the data argument in the call
18:14  serio: I was thinking a pet platypus would be better though
18:14  Cork[home]: blackwhite: you don't need to encode it into the url your self
18:14  serio: I can throw him at my friends
18:14  serio: (they're venomous)
18:14  Cork[home]: ?.get
18:14  bot-t: .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/

18:15  bot-t: jQuery.get(url, [data], [callback], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
18:15  blackwhite: ahh ok
18:15  blackwhite: so basically it works as if I was putting the data into the url but bypasses it? is that correct Cork[home]
18:16  Cork[home]: blackwhite: jquery encodes the object passed in [data] and adds it to he final url
18:16  Cork[home]: ex. { value: 1} will become ?value=1
18:16  blackwhite: got it

18:17  LakWork: yea
18:17  peepz: ajpiano :)
18:17  blackwhite: that is exactly what I need as I am trying to jquery up my css/php site
18:18  peepz: ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/0eN5pvsU ... the submit function does not get triggered in IE6..but works in FF
18:18  LakWork: jquery (verb)
18:18  LakWork: nice
18:18  serio: "you just got totally jQuery'd"
18:18  nvictor: ajpiano: how can i get these boxes?
18:18  Cork[home]: LakWork: jqueryize ;)
18:18  Maro__: Hi, I'm trying to make a suggestions drop-down div appear below a given input text field when its typed in, using this to set the location it appears:
18:18  Maro__: $("#suggestions").offset({ top: ($(this).offset().top+25), left: $(this).offset().left});
18:18  nvictor: ajpiano: :)
18:18  ajpiano: nvictor: which boxes
18:19  nvictor: ajpiano: around the icons
18:19  nvictor: you said they were not released or something
18:19  Maro__: but after the first tooltip, if I type in another text field the offset seems to add on the coordinate changes rather than just move it...uh, advice? :D
18:19  ajpiano: peepz: i don't know, but i don't know why you're using native dom methods to get the value of the input
18:19  ajpiano: nvictor: you mean the radio buttons and stuff that have the drop shadow on them?
18:19  peepz: I can, but thats not the problem.. I just want the submit to get triggerd.
18:20  nvictor: ajpiano: one sec
18:20  Maro__: I'd like it to appear below each $(this) when you click on them, but atm after its activated once it gets further and further to the bottom-right...

18:45  blackwhite: so $('a').attr('href').substr(200) is instead of id or sort_id right?
18:45  Cork[home]: substr(200 will grab from the 200'ts character
18:45  Cork[home]: its as blunt as it can be :)
18:46 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 99 seconds
18:46  Cork[home]: blackwhite: you can search in the string, or use regex on it if you want to be smarter
18:46  blackwhite: ok
18:46  Cork[home]: blackwhite: but if you just want to use ajax to send the url instead of normal http
18:46  Cork[home]: just use href as url in the ajax call
18:46  Cork[home]: no need to ripp it apart first
18:47  blackwhite: ok
18:48  blackwhite: what I am trying to get my head around is how I make a call with a normal a href
18:48  Cork[home]: $('a.ajax').click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.get(this.href, { val2: 'some extra data' });

18:51  Crshman: I tried <object>.data('event') but that didn't yield anything
18:51  Cork[home]: i think its events
18:52  Cork[home]: i know its something like that, don't remeber right now though :/
18:52  Crshman: nope, that's undefined as well
18:53  Cork[home]: it works here
18:53  Crshman: really? meh
18:53  Crshman: what version of jq are you on?
18:53  Cork[home]: $('button').data('events') gives me an object
18:53  Cork[home]: 1.4.2
18:53  Crshman: ah
18:54  Crshman: I wonder if it got changed around in 1.4.3 when they refactored the data prototype
18:54  Cork[home]: might happen
18:54  progrock: Man, where's paul_irish.. need to bother him about html5boilerplate issues I see
18:54  bertrand_: works in 1.4.3 here
18:54  Crshman: really?

18:58 --- dytrivedi_ is now known as dytrivedi
18:58  Cork[home]: progrock: thats actually farly easy to answer
18:58  Cork[home]: progrock: google analytic tracks links you click on the page, if its async, you don't have to wait for the script to complete
18:59  progrock: Cork[home]: slightly confused... I thought the async is to load it before the page compeltes
19:00  Cork[home]: progrock: async means to load it without blocking
19:00  Cork[home]: not before or after
19:01  robsonkarls: can u guys help me here pls, why  when i click in this  div, its does the same event as mouseleave???  http://jsfiddle.net/gDjCk/ ->  here is the page. mini.tnx.com.br
19:01  progrock: Cork[home]: yes.. BUT... the code is at the end of the HTML (unliek described in the asynch page the technique is taken from)
19:01  robsonkarls: ive been working all day on it
19:01  robsonkarls: and nothing
19:01  robsonkarls: =/
19:01  progrock: Cork[home]: I guess all I can think of is if you are performming a ajax request afetr the page loads
19:02  sanguisleft: so I need to add and (int)var to a css margin-top, but my method of getting the css value as a var then using regex to remove the px doing the math then returning the new value seems silly. there must be a better way. can any one point me in the right direction?
19:02  Crshman: bertrand_: thanks for the tip, that's a handy strapon
19:02  temp01: the page loading indicator maybe progrock
19:02  Cork[home]: progrock: if i remember correctly from the last time i diffled with analytic, its that you want to wait for complete page loads, to reduce noice in the logs
19:02  Rinthe: http://codepad.org/eOMmgJpA ok this works now, but i think it renders the control shift and alt keys useless. ex. i can't control+c to copy
19:03  Rinthe: ops: http://codepad.org/2GoIUjSN
19:03  paul_irish: because the page isnt loaded yet. DOMContentLoaded hasnt fired.
19:03  paul_irish: progrock: ^
19:04  progrock: oh, ok... seemed like it was excessive since it was already at the bottom of the page
19:04  ajpiano: sanguisleft: you can use .animate with a 0 deleay
19:04  Cork[home]: robsonkarls: is the img inside the div container?
19:04  EGreg_: hey guys
19:05 --- mfer-lunch is now known as mfer

19:05  EGreg_: how do I make it so that a dropdown autosuggest box disappears when a textbox loses focus, EXCEPT if it loses focus because I clicked in the autosuggest?
19:05  sanguisleft: .me is trying it
19:05  EGreg_: this "blur" and "focus" thing is supremely annoying in js
19:05 * sanguisleft is trying it*
19:05  EGreg_: because there is no way to tell which element has focus
19:05  progrock: Wow, japanese have made huge stried on [sex] robot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFVlzUAZkHY&feature=player_embedded
19:05  EGreg_: does jquery have a way to tell if a child of this element has focus?
19:06  Cork[home]: EGreg_: bind a click to $(document), and use .one to hide the dropdown, then prevent the click from escalating in the dropdown
19:06  Cork[home]: EGreg_: or track the focus
19:07  Cork[home]: var save the previus focused element, and if it was the textbox, show the div again
19:07  Rinthe: http://codepad.org/2GoIUjSN the hotkey works but i think it renders the control shift and alt keys useless. ex. i can't control+c to copy. ideas?
19:08  Cork[home]: EGreg_: focus normally follow up the tree
19:08  Cork[home]: btw
19:09  Cork[home]: oh wait thats hover :x
19:09  Cork[home]: my bad
19:09  EGreg_: Cork: how can I track the focus
19:10  EGreg_: what if I am in the textbox and press tab?
19:10  Cork[home]: EGreg_: store a global variable pointing to the dom element that got focus
19:10  Cork[home]: and if($('target selector')[0] == oldFocus)
19:11  dinosaadeh: guys, this is super noob, but for a form to validate i should do <form method="post" onsubmit="return validate()"> right?
19:12  Cork[home]: no
19:12  Cork[home]: you sould use .submit in a selector
19:12  Cork[home]: not inline
19:12  progrock: paul_irish: another quesiton with the html5boilerplate.. the way yyou do the jQuery fallback laoding... unescape() better than jsut concat the script ie "<scr"+"ipt>...</scr"+ipts>"
19:12  dinosaadeh: Cork[home]: i really would like to use jquery, but here i am taking some baby steps
19:13  progrock: *is unescape
19:13  dinosaadeh: Cork[home]: so kinda sticking to javascript

19:14  Cork[home]: ah, lol
19:15  Cork[home]: good you quoted that XD
19:15  paul_irish: progrock: not better really, i just think it looks nicer.
19:15  Cork[home]: ok, then you might want to use mouseenter, instead of mouseover
19:15  robsonkarls: ok
19:15  dinosaadeh: Cork[home]: well i am sure there are plenty of jquery plugins to validate, but still dont know of any really good and robust one
19:15  EGreg_: cork:i don't know which element got focus
19:15  EGreg_: browsers aren't consistent about the focus thing
19:15  EGreg_: that's the problem :(
19:16  serio: paul_irish, sup with it?
19:16  EGreg_: maybej query can help? how do I find out what element got focus
19:16  Cork[home]: EGreg_: see ?.observe
19:16  bot-t: EGreg_, jQuery Form Observe | jQuery Plugins - This plugin observes values of form elements. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form-observe
19:16  Cork[home]: no...
19:16  ajpiano: EGreg_ document.activeElement
19:16  Cork[home]: one sec
19:16  erichynds: dinosaadeh, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
19:16 * EGreg_ wishes blurt would say which element is getting the focus
19:16  EGreg_: document.activeElement isn't supported by all the browsers I think
19:16  ajpiano: which ones doesn't it work in that you're worried about egreg
19:16  sanguisleft: ajpiano: so I have inserted a variable in but must have done something wrong. because nothing has changed. but i get no error. any hints? $('.visualize').animate({"margin-top":"+="+visInfoHeight},0);
19:17  ajpiano: is visInfoHeight a number, etc
19:17  EGreg_: IE
19:17  ajpiano: live demo, etc.
19:17  temp01: EGreg_: ie invented it...
19:17  EGreg_: Also they are not consistent ... for example can a div be considered an active element?
19:17  EGreg_: yeah but ie I think does a sucky job of telling me which element is active
19:17  EGreg_: are you saying this is reliable and I can use it?
19:18  temp01: it's reliable if all you care about is form elements

19:18  serio: man, there's a lot of people in here...
19:18  EGreg_: well I care that if I click on a dropdown from atextbox, the dropdown doesnt disappear

19:19  ajpiano: you're sure
19:19  ajpiano: ?
19:20  chris535: I have a div with a click event.  That same div has a child div with a click event.  When the child div is clicked, it fires then the parent div's click event fires.  I don't want the parent div's event to fire if the child divs fire. Besides changing the architecture or setting a global var to trigger when the child div fires, is there a better way to solve this?
19:20  temp01: ?stoppropagation @ chris535

19:20  EGreg_: hey
19:20  EGreg_: so should I use :focus in jquery?
19:20  EGreg_: is it better?
19:20  bakers: Frantic: It shouldn't at all
19:20  sanguisleft: its a variable equal to 381 atm
19:20  Frantic: bakers: but it does :(
19:21  Cork[home]: EGreg_: $('*').live(function() { if(window.currectFocus == $('textbox')[0] && this !== $('dropdown')[0]) { $('dropdown').hide(); }; window.currentFocus = this; });
19:21  bakers: Frantic: if you examine the CSS in firebug it shows it is?
19:21  EGreg_: it looks like only elements which support tabindex work this feature, so it won't work....
19:21  paul_irish: serio: sup with what
19:21  Frantic: bakers: yes
19:21  Cork[home]: opps forgot the 'focus' :S
19:21  serio: paul_irish, anything?
19:21  bakers: Frantic: post a mock-up on jsfiddle.net then I guess
19:21  EGreg_: ohh, cork, nice idea........
19:21  EGreg_: but what happens when I press TAB?
19:21  sanguisleft: ajpiano:  but even when I run  $('.visualize').animate({"margin-top":"+=431"},10000); nothing happens
19:22  ajpiano: well that is most curious
19:22  EGreg_: ohhhhh I see. I can bind to "focus" and "click" events right?
19:22  EGreg_: that's what you're saying?

19:34  ajpiano: sanguisleft: can you make the demo actually work? all yo uneed to do is add some elems and css
19:35  dinosaadeh: guys, quick question please
19:35  dinosaadeh: where am i going wrong in this form style
19:35  dinosaadeh: $('#name').bind('change', function() { if($(this).value != '') $('#name').parent().removeClass('required'); else $('#name').parent().addClass('required'); });
19:35  sanguisleft: ajpiano: the problem is is that the soruce is generated by another jquery lib
19:35  ajpiano: alright well since i'm not a psychic...
19:35  Cork[home]: dinosaadeh: its $(this).val(), or this.value or $(this)[0].value
19:36  Cork[home]: not $(this).value
19:36  ajpiano: i can't really assist in that case unless you mkae something that fails

19:36  pheuter: lol, alright
19:36  ben_alman: the .val method abstracts away different behaviors around multiple input types
19:36  Cork[home]: its cause jquery doesn't inport the dom object into it self
19:36  serio: does text() even work on input fields?
19:37  Cork[home]: it wrap them
19:37  ben_alman: so you don't have to worry about select boxes for example
19:37  Cork[home]: serio: no, as the input doens't have any content
19:37  Cork[home]: it works on textarea though
19:37  dinosaadeh: Cork[home]: thanks, however, i think thename of the event to which i am binding .bind('change' is incorrect
19:38  serio: change is for selects
19:38  Cork[home]: ya
19:38  pheuter: ben_alman: Cork[home] thnx
19:38  ben_alman: .text looks at the .nodeValue property
19:38  ben_alman: and not the .value property
19:40  ManxPower: this is "<tr class="contacts-row">" so I would use  $(this).find('> tr:nth-child(1) > a').text(); to get the contents of the href in the first td of that tr, correct?
19:40  Danielpk: ajpiano, u know how i can prevent browser back to old position when user press back button? let me explain better... check this exemple (http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-advanced/)...
19:40  EGreg_: yo I have a question
19:40  ajpiano: Danielpk: what
19:40  EGreg_: how come when I bind an event to a parent
19:41  ajpiano: the whole plugin exists for that purpose
19:41  Danielpk: ajpiano, open this link..
19:41  EGreg_: it doesn't get the event from its children??
19:41  EGreg_: I thought those events should bubble up
19:41  Danielpk: ajpiano, then click at Chickens, scrolldown page.. and press back...
19:41  EGreg_: even if the children are added after
19:41  EGreg_: I use .bind()
19:41  ajpiano: Danielpk: why are you talking to me like i don't know what this plugin does
19:41  EGreg_: what is happening, what events is it capturing? bubbling phase right??
19:41  Danielpk: ajpiano, u recomended it lol
19:41  ajpiano: i know

19:42  EGreg_: wha is hapepning with this bind? argh
19:42  Danielpk: ajpiano, nvm.. i tought u got some expirence with it..
19:42  ManxPower: akahn, wouldn't that get me the URL instead of the <a href....>STUFF I WANT</a>

19:59  glen1: ill try that thanks flam
19:59  Maro__: Hey, does anyone know why first() next() and prev() might be behaving weirdly? I have a list of divs, I use first() to find one, add a class which highlights it, then on a mouseclick:
19:59  Maro__: $("div.suggestionSelected").removeClass("suggestionSelected").next().addClass("suggestionSelected");
19:59  Maro__: to move the highlight down
19:59  Maro__: but its jumping to like the fourth and then to the sixth and all over the place...
20:00  EGreg_: interesting. mousemove works but not click
20:00 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 91 seconds
20:00  serio: is there a way to trace out which fonts are available on a given system?
20:00  EGreg_: oh of course. mousedown! not click! my bad
20:01  Maro__: I've figured its gotta be something to do with using ajax to reload the page...is there a way of having jquery re-load itself when this new page is loaded?
20:01  Maro__: it works fine if the page is just loaded, but if the list is re-generated using javascript its all wrong
20:04  EGreg_: okay 1 more question
20:04  EGreg_: if I do mousedown on an element, move my mouse outsie of it, and release
20:04  EGreg_: does anything get fired? heh
20:04  Phrogz: Maro__: Perhaps your problem is you are either destroying or double-hitting the event handlers?
20:05  paul_irish: serio: yes
20:05  Phrogz: EGreg_: Easy for you to test, right?
20:05  EGreg_: yeah, nothing got fired
20:05  EGreg_: I was kinda asking how ot capture that. I guess $(document) ?
20:05  Phrogz: EGreg_: You could register a doc-level mouseup handler on mousedown, yeah.
20:06  serio: paul_irish, how? :D
20:06  Maro__: Phrogz, what do you mean? Would it help if I pasted some code?
20:06  EGreg_: I FIGURED IT OUT! YAY
20:06  EGreg_: "fullproof" method: 	var results = $('<div style="text-align: left;" />')
20:06  EGreg_: 		.css({
20:06  EGreg_: 			display: 'none',
20:06  EGreg_: 			position: 'absolute',
20:06  EGreg_: 			left: input.offset().left,
20:06  EGreg_: 			top: input.offset().top + input.outerHeight(),
20:06  paul_irish: span in arial.. check height and width.. change it to new font. check height and width
20:06  EGreg_: 			'z-index': 80000,
20:06  EGreg_: 			width: input.outerWidth(),

20:14  Maro__: Phrogz, yeah it looks like the event handler is like, repeating itself. the first time it does it right, the 2nd load it cycles through every 2, the third time 3 etc...how do I kill the old event handler each time the javascript is loaded?
20:14  peepz: any ideas on what could be the problemo?
20:15  Phrogz: Maro__: It depends on where your event handler is defined, how it is bound, and if you are or are not actually replacing your old elements.
20:15  Phrogz: Maro__: Make a test case.
20:15  Maro__: Hmm. Okay i'll fiddle around...thanks
20:17  peepz: ajpiano: works fine in FF, but not in IE :(

21:26  EGreg_: that it's being taken out of the dom?
21:26  Pritam: eTiger13: Thank you very very much
21:26  EGreg_: so I can destroy a bunch of other elements that are related to it
21:26  EGreg_: like if a textbox is taken out, then I would like to take out the autosuggest thing
21:26  eTiger13: Pritam: no {} after fadeOut()
21:26  Pritam: Ah, ok
21:27  Pritam: My bad :/
21:27 @erichynds: EGreg_ remove em when you remove the textbox
21:29  EGreg_: but how do I know when the textbox gets removed
21:29  EGreg_: what if its parent dom element gets removed without me knowing
21:29  EGreg_: okay screw it, in this case I am able to just replace "hide" with "remove" so I don't remain with vestiges after the textbox itself gets removed
21:29  JoshA: Hmm... snover, your comment helped, but I am still having trouble getting access to all functions bound to scroll on the window. What is the best way to do that?
21:29  JoshA: Thanks again

21:31  Vorspire: still in developemnt though
21:31  ben_alman: cool!
21:31  JoshA: snover: I guess that I am still confused. $(window).data("__events__") gives me a function, but I can't get the scroll function that I bound to window earlier with $(window).scroll(check_inview);
21:32  ben_alman: is this for a client?
21:32  ravenz: hello
21:32  Vorspire: it's for a friend :)
21:32  ben_alman: cool
21:32  Vorspire: he wantedthe url's masked, but he wanted to use BBQ too
21:32  snover: JoshA: it’s a function object with properties just like a regular object.
21:32  ben_alman: JoshA if you did (window).scroll(check_inview); earlier, you already have the function, it's check_inview
21:32  ben_alman: you shouldn't need to get it any other way
21:33  snover: also, what ben_alman says.
21:33  JoshA: ben_alman -- check_inview was defined within a closure in a plugin definition
21:33  ravenz: i have title="text" attributes .. is possible to block his pops up on mouse hover?
21:34  JoshA: ah, I think I see -- I need $(window).data("__events__").events.scroll
21:34  Vorspire: ravenz; i don't think you can stop it without remove the title attr
21:34  ravenz: uhm
21:34  JoshA: Thanks for the help snover and ben_alman!
21:34  ben_alman: JoshA why not modify the plugin to use a namespace
21:34  ben_alman: np
21:34  ravenz: it could be usefull to build a custom tooltip
21:35  ravenz: other nice and easy way to do tooltips?
21:35  Vorspire: ravenz; you couldalways use a custom attr prefixed with "data-"
21:35  ravenz: oh cool
21:35  ravenz: something like data-tooltip="text"
21:35  ravenz: ?
21:35  Vorspire: data-title="Hello World" - still conforms to W3C
21:35  Vorspire: yea
21:35  JoshA: ben_alman: modifying the plugin is an idea, I guess I'm not familiar with the 'right' way to namespace the plugin
21:35  ravenz: amazing!
21:35  ravenz: thank you
21:36  ben_alman: .bind( 'type', fn ); -> .bind( 'type.namespace', fn )
21:36  Vorspire: I use it often to store arbitrary data for processing
21:36  ben_alman: where .namespace can be .anything
21:36  Vorspire: ravenz np
21:36  ben_alman: and then you can unbind or trigger it later using the namespace
21:36  ben_alman: ?namespaced events
21:36  ravenz: i never heard about custom attributes

21:40 @erichynds: revenz, data-* attrs will work they just won't validate against xhtml, if you even care about that
21:40  OhaiBBQ: you could do that

21:43 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, this.options = $.extend(true, this.options)
21:43  eTiger13: fission6: are you including youtubin from somewhere?
21:43  grobot: Can I do something like $.bind(Lightbox.start); to fire an event off when that function is called?
21:43  fission6: yes
21:43  fission6: someplace i include jquery which appears to work fine in my alert
21:43  grobot: Or do I need to look at extending the current Lightbox.start function?
21:44  Tprice: ps its the first time i've dont code style like this
21:44  Tprice: so dont really know
21:44  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: Wouldn't that deep copy an already deep copied object? confused.
21:44  Vorspire: erichynds; wouldn't that be the same as doing this.options = this.options?
21:44  ravenz: i dont care about validation..but it have to work on every browser
21:44  ravenz: eh
21:44 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, you just don't want to make a copy, you want to modify the original?
21:44  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: yes, exactly
21:44  Rinthe: http://codepad.org/2GoIUjSN the hotkey works but i think it renders the control shift and alt keys useless. ex. i can't control+c to copy. ideas?
21:44 @erichynds: Vorspire, yeah i assumed you'd continue to pass shite onto it
21:44  Vorspire: xD
21:45  hariom: Hi, I have a page which gets single or multiple tables on the basis of the server data. And for each table, I have a row which needs a unique id. How can I detect how many tables are drawn and how to create dynamic ids and use those ids to get Ajax response?
21:45  eTiger13: Rinthe: on line 3 that seems like it would tell it to ignore those keys
21:45 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, just don't pass an empty object as the target
21:45  Rinthe: eTiger13: what can i use instead?
21:45  fission6: eTiger13: i am not sure what i need to call it like $(function{$.youtube()}), whats going on there
21:45 @erichynds: ?extend @ EnigmaCurry
21:45  bot-t: EnigmaCurry, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
21:45  eTiger13: hariom: $(tables).length
21:45  eTiger13: Rinthe: delete that line?
21:46  Dykotomee: ?watermark
21:46  bot-t: Dykotomee, form input textbox watermark | jQuery Plugins - Yet another watermark plug-in. This one differs from the others by its: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/form-input-textbox-watermark
21:46  hariom: eTiger13: and how to generate dynamic ids?
21:46  Rinthe: eTiger: but i need the hotkey to not work whent hose keys are held down
21:46  eTiger13: fission6: is the plugin even compatible with noconflict mode?
21:46  Vorspire: hariom; http://acorn.vita-nex.com/JavaScript/serial_provider.vn.js this can generate unique ID's
21:46  fission6: no idea
21:46  eTiger13: hariom: autoincrementing ids should work
21:46  fission6: i am just trying to pull all youtube links and embed them
21:46  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: hmm... from what I understand, this.options is already a copy of the object I've passed in, so any modification I do to this.options.some_key will not modify the original object passed in
21:47  eTiger13: Rinthe: well then control+c are not going to work
21:47  Rinthe: eTiger13: i want control c to work, yeah its not working right now
21:47  eTiger13: Rinthe: or else you have to test for all the ones that you do want to work and not return false on those
21:47 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, ah, you are correct
21:47  Rinthe: eTiger13: wow theres no way around it?
21:47 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, why don't you want a copy?
21:47  eTiger13: fission6: all youtube links ever? thats a lot of links
21:47  hariom: Currently if I give <tr id="somerow"> then if there are multiple tables, I get same id for all tables
21:48  hariom: eTiger13, can you tell me how to auto increment?
21:48  eTiger13: Rinthe: well you are telling the script to exit when one of those keys are pressed. so you would have to add exclusions for any combos you want to add
21:48  eTiger13: hariom: when you are creating the rows, give them unique ids
21:48  eTiger13: hariom:  var x = 0; x++;
21:49  Rinthe: isnt there something in javascript that just lets go go on
21:49  Rinthe: like nothing happened
21:49  Rinthe: if those keys are pressed
21:49  fission6: eTiger13: huh?
21:49  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: I have a dropdown widget I've created. I have an object model that I want modified when the user chooses something from the dropdown, so I thought I would pass in the object model to the widget
21:49  eTiger13: Rinthe: yeah, delete line 3 and it will
21:49  Rinthe: but then
21:49  Rinthe: eTiger: but then fi i try to do Control C it'll focus into my comment box
21:50  Vorspire: hariom; var uniqueID = $.SerialProvider.generate("prefix", 9999); would generate something like prefix-5564124641 when using that plugin i linked you, every time you generate, it will be different
21:50  hariom: eTiger13: Number of Tables are not fixed (we don't know how many tables will come on a page at any time, server data decides that).
21:50 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, perhaps you could fire events with this._trigger() and do it that way?
21:50 @erichynds: then listen to the events and modify the object...
21:50  hariom: eTiger13: if number of tables are not fixed, how can I give unique ids
21:50  eTiger13: Rinthe: you are asking for conflicting things. if you want to ignore those keys then ignore them. if you want to allow them with specific other keys then add those exclusions in
21:50  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: ah, yes, fire my own events. That's a good idea.
21:50  EnigmaCurry: erichynds: thanks.
21:50  eTiger13: hariom: if the server is generating the markup then add the ids there
21:51  fission6: eTiger13: $(function() {     $.youtubin(); }); what does that syntax even say, i dont understandt $(function(){..)
21:51  hariom: hmm...
21:51  eTiger13: hariom: otherwise you have to parse all of the tables and append ids after
21:51  Rinthe: eTigher13: like include C with control and stuff?
21:51  Phrogz: fission6: $(someFunction);  is a shortcut for "run this function when the page is ready"
21:51  eTiger13: fission6: its an alias for .ready() ?ready
21:51  Phrogz: fission6: function(){ ... }   is a function literal.
21:51  fission6: ohhh ok
21:52  Vorspire: anonymous function
21:52 @erichynds: EnigmaCurry, if you don't know already the widget factory has an event triggering method which you can use - no need to roll your own
21:52  fission6: i just want to run youtubin() one a link when a user right clicks
21:52  eTiger13: Rinthe: if ( e.key == control AND e.key == c ) type stuff

21:54  fission6: here is my latest code, which does nothing, doesn't even show the alert, http://pastebin.com/NKC9j20f
21:55  fission6: may be this youtubin thing doesn't event work
21:56  eTiger13: fission6: what is that code part of? wheres the rest of it?
21:56  Vorspire: code not running at all usually means scope fail or a previous error stopped parsing

23:13  rvdb: sorry, full example (based on http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/xml.html) at http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282416/
23:15  eTiger13: little caesars pizza for $5.50, Subway sandwich for $5.50 or sandwich from local deli thats so-so for $6 ?
23:16  Dracos: a local deli that's not as good as subway? wtf?
23:16  eTiger13: they only have 1 bread choice and not a a lot of choices in terms of sauces/toppings
23:17  bakers: eTiger13: how big is the pizza?
23:17  Dykotomee: Dracos: Not that Subway's bad, but how hard can it be to make a sandwich?
23:17  bot-t: (17 mins 40 secs ago) <Dykotomee> tell Dykotomee I think I'm awesome.
23:18  Dracos: imo, subway is meh
23:18  kanzie: My buttons in dialog() does not get the button-classes from styles... any reasong for this yu think?
23:18  eTiger13: bakers: enough to feed a person for two meals unless they are really hungry
23:18  bakers: eTiger13: So the choice is... bad pizza or a bad sub?
23:19  eTiger13: Dracos:  yeh but its not like i have a whole lot of choices when it comes to close by food
23:19  bakers: I choose pizza... even when it's bad it's still sorta good
23:19  eTiger13: kanzie: you have to call .button after opening the dialog since .button doesnt have a .live
23:19  Dracos: what makes the deli not as good as subway?
23:19  eTiger13: i didnt say its not as good. its about the same but not as wide as a selection as subway
23:20  kanzie: eTiger13: thanks
23:20  kanzie: eTiger13: so, $('#mydialog').button();
23:20  snollux: hey there. How can I snag the return value of a PHP call to a JS variable?
23:20  Dracos: subway, then
23:20  Dracos: that deli has no business calling itself a deli
23:21  eTiger13: kanzie: in the dialog open callback, call .button on your buttons
23:21  eTiger13: ?jquery.get @ snollux
23:21  bot-t: snollux, jQuery.get(url, [data], [callback], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
23:21  eTiger13: Dracos: it really doesnt. overall their food isnt great but since they are in walking distance of a lot of business and not much else is they get business
23:22  snollux: eTiger13: and is that mutually exclusive with using .load? or can I store a return value given by a PHP script called by .load?
23:22  paul_irish: anyone with basic video editing skills that is a yayquery fan and wants to smush together some ACTION FOOTAGE?
23:23  eTiger13: snollux: no, you can. its all still ajax
23:23  Dracos: paul_irish: if no one else answers, I could do it
23:23  eTiger13: iMovie ftw!
23:24  kanzie: eTiger13: I keep getting .button is not a function when calling it on the $('#mydialog).dialog().button()
23:24  eTiger13: kanzie: no, you have to call .button on the elements that are actually going to become buttons
23:24  eTiger13: ?dialog
23:24  bot-t: eTiger13, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
23:25  kanzie: eTiger13: oh... but they are created in the dialog-statement, how do I get hold of them? $('#mydialog > button') ?
23:25  eTiger13: kanzie: or if you just have the standard buttons for the dialog like yes or no, then just use dialogs builtin button creation
23:25  snollux: so, say I have wrapper.load('createRequest.php', $.merge(f1, f2));.. can I just store whatever output is returned in php like var f = wrapper.load('createRequest.php', $.merge(f1, f2));
23:25  rvdb: perhaps someone has an example of jquery-ui autocomplete with remote XML datasource?
23:26  kanzie: eTiger13: but that is what I am using, still all I get is a <button></button> generated in the dialog without any button-classes
23:26  eTiger13: rvdb: you cant get json?
23:27  eTiger13: snollux:  no. what are you trying to do exactly?
23:27  eTiger13: ?p @ kanzie
23:27  bot-t: kanzie, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
23:27 --- rwaldron_busy is now known as rwaldron
23:27  rvdb: if all else fails, I guess I'll have to start tweaking the serverside scripts
23:27  kanzie: actually I keep getting el.button is not a function
23:28  kanzie: seems like button() is not in my jqueryui-js
23:28  snollux: eTiger13 You know, I actually just realized that what I did is stupid. I don't need to do .load(), I can change to get
23:28  rvdb: but the autocomplete docs suggest XML is possible
23:28  rvdb: (serving data via XML / XQuery /XSLT, so XML is the native option for me)
23:28  kanzie: and its superhard to upgrade since I have a custom css built with themeroller... hate to go through that process and redesign it every time
23:28  eTiger13: kanzie: it might not be in there. your theme.css should have a url in it
23:28  eTiger13: rvdb: where?
23:29  elpargo: hi, I have a node X and I want to create a new div that will wrap it, which jquery method should I use ? after,append,prepend I'm missing the other one :)
23:29  bot-t: hi, .prepend() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
23:29  eTiger13: ?wrap @ elpargo
23:29  bot-t: elpargo, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
23:29  elpargo: ahhh wrap! thanks eTiger13
23:30  rvdb: eTiger13: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#xml
23:31  eTiger13: rvdb: oh yeah. you can do it that way. but you dont want to fetch the xml once right? you want it on every keystroke?
23:32  rvdb: eTiger13: yep, on every keystroke (a dynamic search script, serverside)
23:32  rvdb: querying an XML collection
23:34  paul_irish: Dracos: pm'ing you
23:34 --- ezra-g is now known as ezra-g|afk
23:35  eTiger13: rvdb: that wont be fun. easier to just switch to json
23:36  rvdb: eTiger13: you mean performance-wise?
23:37  eTiger13: rvdb: no i mean coding wise. and probably performance wise too since not as much data will be transferred using json vs xml
23:38  berttrand: rvdb: does this help you http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/xml.html
23:39  rvdb: berttrand: well, yes, that's where I started from to tweak it to a more dynamic version: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282416/
23:40  rvdb: I think I'm nearly there: the ajax request does get XML data, I can parse it with JQuery, but can't seem to pass it on to autocomplete the right way
23:43  snollux: eTiger13: I'm trying to run a PHP script [which does some SQL stuff] and then grab the return value into a jQuery variable. $.get('createSalesRequest.php', $.merge(f1, f2), function(data) {alert("RID:" + data); return false;});
23:43  snollux: data seems empty
23:43  berttrand: rvdb: is you xml structure right?
23:44  rvdb: berttrand: 100% correct
23:44  rvdb: I can see it returned for the ajax call in firebug
23:45  rvdb: I can access the data in the JQuery script
23:45  qom2: very nooby question here, just a beginner, trying to add a wrapping div around the text below the image here: http://www.eddieahgren.se/#735017/Nytt-test tried with: $('.project_content').wrapInner('<div class="contenttext"></div>').insertAfter('.project_title'); but it made the site break, would appreciate some help if someone could spare some time
23:45  qom2: would be appreciated
23:45  rvdb: but still, the autocomplete widget doesn't seem to pick it up (no dropdown is shown)
23:47  petterr: Hello :-)
23:47  berttrand: so what changes did you make to it?
23:47  eTiger13: snollux:  what are you going to do with that variable?
23:48  snollux: eTiger13: I'm going to use it to redirect to another site
23:48  snollux: based on the query's result
23:48  petterr: Can some1 help me please? Is there any way how to simulate clicking on draggable by onmouseover on some other object?
23:48  snollux: so it's a URL that it'll return
23:49  rvdb: berttrand: I tried to follow the closing comments at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#xml , and moved the ajax call to the source: property
23:49  snollux: then I'll do window.location(URLvariable)
23:49  eTiger13: ?wrap @ qom2
23:49  bot-t: qom2, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
23:49  qom2: not wrapinner?
23:50  eTiger13: qom2: you might also want to check which element you want to actually insert (maybe you should be using append) is the element that is being called at the time you call insertAfter
23:50  eTiger13: ?wrapinner @ qom2
23:50  bot-t: qom2, .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
23:51  eTiger13: qom2: do you want to wrap the element itself or the content in that element?
23:51  qom2: just the content, well, the text
23:52  qom2: but the div I'm targetting has some other divs in it
23:52  qom2: that's what makes it hard
23:53  qom2: so annoying that they didn't put a paragraph around it or nothing
23:56  eTiger13: qom2: move all the divs out, wrap the text , move the divs back in and then do whatever
23:57  qom2: all with jquery?
23:59  snollux: anyone?
