00:58  webben: JAAulde: Yes. It should be available as a property of the page's window object which greasemonkey has access to
00:58  JAAulde: webben: weird, I thought so.  but this script isn't working
00:58  webben: (Should be accessible that is - whether it will work I'm not sure)

00:58 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 108 seconds
00:59  JAAulde: ok, thanks. i'm out
01:00  trollboy: Can you put buttons in jqgrid?
01:04  effekt: I suppose there is no seperate channel for jquery-ui?
01:05  trollboy: effekt, nopers.. but they support it pretty good here
01:05  trollboy: what seems to be the issue?
01:05  effekt: not looking for support, more for development discussion
01:06  effekt: is scott gonzales around here somewhere and what'd be his nickname?
01:08  trollboy: effekt, no idea
01:08  snover: effekt: he is not here right now
01:08  trollboy: wanna help me with my jqgrid question?
01:09  effekt: snover: what's his usual nick? I found a tiny error in my recent commit to ui and don't feel like opening up another pull request for a single character ;)
01:09  trollboy: I've got a grid of stats per item, but instead of allowing the user to edit the grid, I want an edit button on each row, that opens up a new page /items/edit.php?id=itemid
01:09  snover: effekt: You do not need to open a new pull request, just make a new commit.
01:10  snover: effekt: pull requests are “live”, and pick up any new commits made to a branch.
01:10  snover: Noncoincidentally, this is part of why you never develop on your master branch.
01:11  effekt: snover: I know, but I figured he could just throw that in with something else, since it's only a single character to change
01:12  snover: git commit -a -m "Fix to previous commit" && git push origin
01:12  effekt: oh man, I hate small commits like that
01:26  thedangler: what is it called when I want to add click events to generated html with out have to traverse the dom and add click events

01:52  fruitwerks: what is the context?
01:52  TheIronSky: hm... not quite
01:52  snover|away: #jquery, for all your thesaurus needs
01:52 * fruitwerks ... passion
01:52  TheIronSky: the necessity for passionate, efficient work in order to remain contemporaneous. So, from that alone, one can derive that one of the main "driving forces..."

01:58  thedangler: whats the best way to submit a list of data where there are multiples of one thing? name="first[]"?
01:59  TheIronSky: wait
01:59  TheIronSky: are the numerals all spelled out like that?
01:59  TheIronSky: as in, "first", "second", "third"
02:00  TheIronSky: ??
02:00  thedangler: no. as in name="first_name[]" there would be alot of first_name[]
02:00  TheIronSky: oh...
02:01  TheIronSky: so you just want to submit a list of them depending on the number of objects with that class there are on the page?
02:02  thedangler: multiple inputs for one name ..
02:02  TheIronSky: huh... I guess I've never had to do that.. let me see what I can do for you
02:02  TheIronSky: give me a minute
02:03  thedangler: i was thinking of making a json string and base_64 encoding it thendecoding it  but ... dont want to
02:03  snover: thedangler: it depends upon the backend that you are using
02:04  thedangler: php
02:04  snover: there is certainly no reason to base64-encode anything.

02:11 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
02:12  TheIronSky: thedangler: this might help
02:12  TheIronSky: I just used the .size() tag
02:12  TheIronSky: and i think It might be what you need
02:12  TheIronSky: http://jsfiddle.net/TheIronSky/aKGyE/
02:13  thedangler: im looking to submit data? I dont know how that applies
02:13 --- unCork[home] is now known as Guest82789
02:14  TheIronSky: well, you wanted to count the divs, amirite?
02:14  TheIronSky: so

02:14  TheIronSky: submit the variable "div_count"
02:15 --- oksushi|na is now known as oksushi
02:16  wunderkin: i don't think he's asking anything about a count
02:19  TheIronSky: well, then I'm confused.
02:19  Trisox: :D
02:22  snover: TheIronSky thedangler DO NOT use the .size() function
02:22  snover: jesus
02:22  Trisox: hey snover
02:22  snover: hi Trisox.
02:23  Trisox: how your doing?
02:24  houdini: How can I set focus event on body in iframe in designMode? Actually I need event when user set cursor in iframe
02:25  Guest22905: Howdy, how do I make my function run once every 2th second?
02:26  houdini: Guest22905: look up at setTimeout function
02:26  Trisox: snover can i pick your brain i did a selectbox replacement but some how the selections dont happen live any more.. http://vospascal.nl/patrick/ any ideas?
02:29  snover: Trisox: nope, not right now
02:30  Guest22905: houdini I tried while(true) { setTimeout(run(), 1000); }
02:30  Guest22905: it ran it once
02:30  snover: Guest22905: you need to learn the difference between a function reference and invoking a function
02:31  Trisox: i would use jquery ui but for only selectboxes it to big.. i think
02:34  houdini: Guest22905: basic idea is that you call your function in timeout and that function call timeout again, like recursion, google it, it's really common problem
02:35  houdini: Any one know answer to my question? How can I set focus event on body in iframe in designMode? Actually I need event when user set cursor in iframe
02:35  rmurphey: designMode .. ?
02:36  Trisox: he using dreamweaver or something
02:36  houdini: rmurphey: yes iframe.document.designMode="on"
02:36  houdini: Trisox: lol, no I on Ubuntu, no dreamwaver
02:37  Trisox: :P
02:37  rmurphey: learn something new every day
02:37  Trisox: me 2
02:37  houdini: Trisox: designMode is property
02:37  Trisox: whats designmode for then
02:38  Trisox: what does it do
02:38  rmurphey: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533720(VS.85).aspx
02:38  rmurphey: There is no public standard that applies to this property.
02:38  rmurphey: shocking
02:38  firebook: hi can we click an url without refreshing page?
02:38  houdini: Trisox: when you send emails in Gmail, you type your email not in textarea, but in iframe that has designMode="on"
02:38  Trisox: oh didnt know that
02:39  houdini: Actually you use designMode in rich text editors
02:39  Trisox: ah
02:39  vladikoff: also if you used etherpad, they had that
02:39 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
02:40 * rmurphey had no idea
02:40  Trisox: any one an idea whats wrong with my fancy slectbox? http://vospascal.nl/patrick/ the normal ones work good
02:41  houdini: Trisox: there are a lot of select boxes at this page
02:41  rmurphey: ?event @ firebook
02:41 @bot-t: firebook, Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
02:41  Trisox: the first one
02:41  Trisox: that looks fancy
02:41  rmurphey: firebook: you can bind to the click event of an anchor and then preventDefault() on the event
02:41  MaxMeents__: is there a way to say if mouseover true?
02:41  Trisox: ?mousenter
02:41 @bot-t: Trisox, .mouseenter() - Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
02:41  houdini: Trisox: do you mean images are broken?
02:41  Trisox: no
02:41  MaxMeents__: if($('.class').mouseover() = true){do something}
02:41  Trisox: it doesnt update my results live
02:42  Trisox: the other ones do
02:42  rmurphey: MaxMeents__: $('.class').mouseenter(function() { /* do something */ });
02:42  Trisox: like selecteer leeftijd 15
02:42  Trisox: that gives you live result
02:42  rmurphey: MaxMeents__: mouseenter is an event, not a method that returns a boolean
02:42  MaxMeents__: OH
02:42  MaxMeents__: ok, thanks
02:43  Trisox: but that stoped working with the selectbox fancy thingy
02:43  rmurphey: so, really, $('.class').bind('mouseenter', function(event) { /* do something */ } );;
02:43  daemon: hey all i am trying to use delay to queue animations
02:43  daemon: delay(50).animateWave('.x1');
02:43  daemon: apparenyly delay is undefined?
02:43  MaxMeents__: whats the bind about? I've never understood its purpose even after reading about it, somehow I've avoided it
02:43  rmurphey: daemon: you have to call .delay() on a selection i believe
02:43  Trisox: i didnt want to use a to use jquery ui for it because its to fucking big
02:44  daemon: shit. ok ty rmurphey
02:44  rmurphey: MaxMeents__: .bind() lets you bind to any event
02:44  Trisox: for something that simple
02:44  rmurphey: there is also the .mouseenter() convenience function
02:44  rmurphey: .bind('mouseenter', function() { ... }) is the same as .mouseenter(function() { ... });
02:44  rmurphey: generally speaking, anyway
02:44  MaxMeents__: ok, how else could you use bind?
02:44  rmurphey: MaxMeents__: you could bind to a custom event
02:45  rmurphey: also, bind lets you pass arbitrary event-related data
02:45  MaxMeents__: hmm... definitly going to go back and give that a look, its been awhile since i started now
02:45  rmurphey: .bind("someCustomThing", function() { ... });
02:45  rmurphey: see also .trigger()
02:45  MaxMeents__: alright rmurphey, back to work, thank you for the help!

02:48  daemon: hmm
02:50  rmurphey: Trisox: on a saturday night, i'm going to be a lot more helpful if there's a lot less extraneous code to look at
02:50  rmurphey: which is to say
02:50  rmurphey: ?reduce

02:54  MaxMeents__: lol, sorry
02:54 --- snover sets modes [#jquery +q daemon*!*@*]
02:55  trollboy: I at least wrote a jquery function in marker on my distributor cap before asking for the firing sequence of my 78 Pinto
02:58  MaxMeents__: Alright, I finally found the problem (swear to god I looked for it for over 7 hours) but now I'm not sure how to fix it, could someone take a look? I described the problem to the best of my ability in the link http://jsfiddle.net/mBPYa/
03:02  ajpiano: effekt: lol snover
03:02  ajpiano: you +q with an iron fist
03:06  Excell: doea anyone here use jqtouch ?
03:08 @snover: ajpiano: Bitches better keep their hands off my bot-t or else I’ll cut them off >:(
03:09  ajpiano: lol
03:09  Trisox: some how i dont recive focus ...
03:09  Trisox: Received Focus: <select style="width: 190px;" name="geslecht"> shoudl be this

03:09  Trisox: i dont get any thing
03:09  trollboy: Neato
03:14  Zxurian: so I have a question regarding the .blur() function and traversal
03:14  Zxurian: http://jsfiddle.net/VRtSA/
03:15  Zxurian: what selector, or combination thereof, would I use to have the alert fire if it leaves any input, but if the input is grouped (ie. special_wrapper), that it only fires when focus leaves any one of the inputs within the wrapper, but not if your going from one input to another within the wrapper
03:15  hwk2|1: hello
03:15  hwk2|1: $("#up a").click(function() {
03:15  hwk2|1: gives me #up a is null
03:16  hwk2|1: whats the problem?
03:17 --- bowens is now known as tminos
03:19  Zxurian: hwk, I would check your DOM to make sure that #up actually exists
03:20  hwk2|1: Zxurian: WRONG!!!
03:20  hwk2|1: EVEN IF IT DIDN"T exist it would return an empty value
03:21  ajpiano: IS JQUERY EVEN DEFINED
03:21  ajpiano: CAN YOU MAKE A TEST PAGE
03:21 * hwk2|1 how can i get that error msg if jquery wasnt loaded?
03:21  trollboy: Capslock: Its cruise control for cool
03:22  hwk2|1: PROBLEM: jquery and scriptacolous dont get along very well
03:22  hwk2|1: i use them both
03:22  hwk2|1: jQuery instead of $
03:22  ajpiano: ?NOCONFLICT
03:22 @bot-t: jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/

03:22  hwk2|1: yeah yeah
03:22  trollboy: hwk2|1, can you give us a url?
03:22  hwk2|1: to the page?
03:22  trollboy: yeah
03:22  Zxurian: http://jsfiddle.net/Wfvz9/
03:22  ajpiano: no, a random unrelated one
03:22  Zxurian: works fine for me
03:22  hwk2|1: sure
03:23  trollboy: so we can observe the fail in real time and suggest where to apply win in order to resolve
03:23  hwk2|1: http://carbonenergy.ro/
03:23  hwk2|1: see base.js
03:23  hwk2|1: i modded the code and fixed the issue
03:24  trollboy: so... what are we fixing?
03:24  hwk2|1: when clicked on  ^ Sus -- translated to UP
03:24  trollboy: if.. its working..
03:24  hwk2|1: well i would be thankfull if i could use $ instead of jQuery
03:24  hwk2|1: which saves me some time
03:24  ajpiano: uhh
03:24  trollboy: You can
03:24  trollboy: see that noconflict bit
03:24  ajpiano: if the $(document).ready(function() {}) part is firing
03:24  trollboy: you can toggle it on and off
03:24  ajpiano: then jQuery is known as $
03:24  hwk2|1: <ajpiano> then jQuery is known as $: WRONG!
03:24  ajpiano: jQuery is also passed as an argument to the document ready handler
03:25  hwk2|1: theoretically , maybe it is
03:25  hwk2|1: practically it aint
03:25  ajpiano: you said you made this code work
03:25  Zxurian: if jQuery wasn't defined as $, then your earlier comment would return a "#up is null", it would faill out as $ being undefined
03:25  trollboy: hwk2|1, it does work that way, you've implemented it wrong.
03:25  Zxurian: [wouldn't]
03:25  hwk2|1: jQuery("#up a").click(function() {
03:25  hwk2|1: this works
03:25  trollboy: and it sounds like you did some shoe-horning to force it to work anyway
03:25  hwk2|1: :|
03:26  ajpiano: hwk2|1, what about $(document).ready()
03:26  ajpiano: obviously it doesn't?
03:26  hwk2|1: it does
03:26  trollboy: btw what is this popup?
03:27  trollboy: ajpiano, I'm willing to bet that $(document).ready() is scriptaculous
03:27  hwk2|1: ohhhh
03:27  hwk2|1: :)
03:27  hwk2|1: smarty debug is on
03:27  trollboy: he's including it immediately after including jquery
03:27  hwk2|1: that might
03:27  hwk2|1: interfere
03:27  hwk2|1: close your eyes please :D
03:28 * hwk2|1 thats just an ilussion
03:28  ajpiano: hwk2|1 http://fixee.org/paste/xmrjlnz/
03:29  hwk2|1: ajpiano: took a look right here
03:29  hwk2|1: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
03:29  hwk2|1: why would i do that?
03:29  ajpiano: huh?
03:29  hwk2|1: used it this way in all and never had problems
03:29  ajpiano: if $ is not jQuery then you can't use it as jQuery
03:30  ajpiano: if you use either of those approaches, $ will be jQuery inside of the function scope
03:30  frioden: Need a bit of help...trying to iterate over a list of divs, setting element[i].style.top to a floating point digit...works beautifully in FF, Safari, chrome, but in IE is constantly strips it to an INT, removing the decimal places...
03:30  frioden: anyone heard of this or know a fix...
03:31  hwk2|1: obviously scriptacolous is taking over $
03:31 * hwk2|1 bad ass lous
03:32  ajpiano: and i gave you two solutions that will work regardless of what else is on the page
03:33  hwk2|1: var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
03:33  hwk2|1: this will do thanks
03:33  ajpiano: helping you has been a true pleasure
03:33  trollboy: lol
03:33  trollboy: I'm gunna grab a bite to eat, bbl
03:34  Zxurian: so as far as the .blur() function goes, is there a way to have it fire off of a group, and not individually?
03:35 * hwk2|1 liar :D
03:35  Trisox: any one an idea wy i dont get a focus back on the first styled select box http://vospascal.nl/patrick/
03:35  ajpiano: Zxurian, not per se, like that
03:36  Zxurian: http://jsfiddle.net/Zxurian/VRtSA/
03:36  Zxurian: i figured there wouldn't be an easier
03:36  Zxurian: [easy way out]
03:36  Trisox: i use http://vospascal.nl/patrick/js/selectbox.js
03:37  Zxurian: I'm trying to fire an $.ajax request whenever the user tabs to a different filed
03:37  Zxurian: [field]
03:37  Zxurian: but not if the user is going between fields of a group
03:37  Zxurian: ie, 4.blur, 5.blur, and (1 || 2 || 3).blur
03:37  ajpiano: Zxurian, long story short, you're going to need to use focus and blur handlers and keep track of whether or not a "group" has been uncofused
03:38  Zxurian: meh, thought as much, was trying to avoid it
03:38  Zxurian: so basically I have to check each input individually, keeping track of where the focus is coming from, and where it's going to, right?
03:38  hwk2|1: fixed it :D
03:38  Trisox: nice
03:38  ajpiano: Trisox, the proxy element that it's creating isn't focusable cause it doesn't have a tabIndex or anything like that
03:39  Trisox: mmm
03:39  Trisox: ?tabIndex

03:39  Trisox: is there an easy way to fix this?
03:39  ajpiano: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Selectmenu Trisox
03:39  Trisox: i found the jquery ui to big for only a select menu
03:40  ajpiano: that's cause it actually works and doesn't suck massive shit like this one
03:40  ajpiano: :p
03:40  Trisox: i only need that element not the whole thing
03:40  ajpiano: i need to not have this discssuion right now
03:41  Trisox: but its 30 times as big...
03:41  trave: hehehe
03:41  Trisox: even if you download some parts is huge
03:43  ajpiano: well, as you know, it's FORBIDDEN to look at the source code to see how they solve the problem
03:43  Trisox: :P
03:43  Trisox: haha true
03:43  Trisox: ill strip it down..
03:45  Zxurian: i'm looking through the docs, but I don't see it, is there such thing as a .hasfocus() function, or do I have to check a .focus() against a var set by the previous element with an inherent .blur() ?
03:47  ajpiano: you can use document.activeElement
03:47  ajpiano: or use this :focus pseudoselector, which uses document.activeElement
03:47  ajpiano: http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/67ede2e034ab62f3/def5b2207b99a731
03:48  Zxurian: interesting...
03:49  Zxurian: bah, i still have to check against where the focus is coming from..,
03:49  Zxurian: thanks for the reference though, appreciate it

03:59  carbocation: Does anyone do all of their HTML generation via jQuery?
03:59  biagidp: snover: thanks, the invalid URL was responsible. I'd been wondering if I was going to need to use jsonp instead....
03:59  carbocation: For example, I have a page that consists of a form (where you can choose what data you want to see) and a canvas (where that data will be graphed).
04:00  carbocation: Normally I'd create everything in PHP. This time, I'm having PHP only handle the JSON/data creation, and thinking of having jQuery handle everything else
04:00  carbocation: But the thought of actually creating the HTML form elements in jQuery seems a bit weird.
04:00  ajpiano: you should use templating, carbocation
04:00  ajpiano: but like
04:00  ajpiano: that's not really for creating ALL your html
04:00  ajpiano: if you want your content to be like, indexable
04:00  carbocation: ajpiano: In this case, there really won't be text for indexing
04:01  carbocation: It's just scatterplots and histograms, no text
04:01  ajpiano: it just depends like, what you're using it for
04:01  carbocation: ajpiano: templating is a good pointer; I'll look into that further
04:01  ajpiano: ?templating
04:01 @bot-t: jQuery's official templating solution - http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl | underscore.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/ | mustache.js - http://mustache.github.com/
04:01  carbocation: ajpiano: I'm using BBQ, so my query strings are like http://www.example.com/#x=age&y=money
04:02  ajpiano: oh ok
04:02  hwk2|1: that aint for search engines
04:02  ajpiano: if you have a lot of repetitive html chunks that you need to build from json data, templating is definitely the way to go
04:02  hwk2|1: control panel the best
04:02  carbocation: ajpiano: awesome
04:03  carbocation: hwk2|1: is control panel a templating engine?
04:03  ajpiano: no
04:06  Zxurian: if an object has both a .blur() and a .change() attached to it, which fires first?

14:40  SeriousJonny: hmm
14:40  SeriousJonny: i like to change it before i append it
14:40  SeriousJonny: to the dom
14:40  Zxurian: well you need some way to identify that div
14:41  Zxurian: either by referencing the parent, or adding a one time use class that doens't change to that div
14:41  SeriousJonny: well when i ise
14:41  SeriousJonny: use*
14:41 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 112 seconds
14:41  SeriousJonny: $(div2append)
14:41  SeriousJonny: in firebug i get the div
14:41  caludio: SeriousJonny,  $('<img/>').addClass('something').appendTo($("<div/>"));
14:42  caludio: first the IMG. edit it, append.
14:43  Zxurian: <div id="changes" class="doesntChange"><img src="foo" /></div>    -     $(".doesntChange img").bar();
14:44  SeriousJonny: what i dont understand is
14:44  SeriousJonny: div2append = '<div id="dynamic"><img id="pic" src="'+Images.images[items]+'">'+Images.desc[items]+'</div>';
14:44  SeriousJonny: when i use a console.log(div2append)
14:44  SeriousJonny: i get the div before it placed to the dom
14:45  SeriousJonny: so it has to be easy to select the images
14:45  SeriousJonny: out of this div
14:45  SeriousJonny: when i inspect it
14:46  Zxurian: what do you mean when you log it you "get the div before it"
14:46  Zxurian: can you post an example to jsfiddle.net?
14:46  SeriousJonny: look
14:46  SeriousJonny: try just this
14:47  SeriousJonny: dynamic = '<div id="something"><img src="nonexistend.jpg"></div>'; console.log($(dynamic));
14:47  Zxurian: your using jQuery improperly though
14:48 --- unreal_ is now known as unreal
14:48  Zxurian: jQuery takes identifiers within it's object selection, #div, .class, element, etc...
14:48  Zxurian: what your passing to the identifier is the straight html
14:48  Zxurian: so your actually saying $("<div id="something"><img src="nonexistend.jpg"></div>"), which jQuery is trying to interpert as identifiers and failing out, thats why your probably getting odd results
14:49  SeriousJonny: hmm
14:49  SeriousJonny: why is something like this working then in the next attempt
14:50  SeriousJonny: $(dynamic).hide().appendTo('#main').fadeIn();
14:51  Zxurian: i'd say it's just coincidence. jQuery takes identifiers, not html, so when it tries to interpert it, it's coming up with the same element, even though it's parsing it incorrectly
14:53  jeezlephaz: hey guys i cant get a function working properly : http://pastie.org/1329881

15:06  peekaboo: Is it possible to save the current point ou're scrolled to on a page, and then go back there later with qjuery?
15:07  peekaboo: (the scenario is that my page refreshes data, and it keeps messing up where you were because this data is at the bottom of the page)
15:14  SeriousJonny: $(window).scrollTop();
15:14  SeriousJonny: then use a scrollTo plugin to goto there again
15:15  peekaboo: OK thanks :-) I'll look into that
15:15  peekaboo: As soon as my IDE downloads :s
15:15  SeriousJonny: well
15:16  SeriousJonny: $(window).scrollTop(100);
15:16  SeriousJonny: works in firefox
15:16  SeriousJonny: so
15:16  peekaboo: Well this hopefully will be deployed on Chrome
15:16  peekaboo: If it works on that it'll be fine..
15:16  SeriousJonny: current = $(window).scrollTop(); past = (from a cookie); if(current != past){$(window).scrollTop(past);}
15:17  peekaboo: An alternative would be not to empty this div each time and display the loader
15:17  peekaboo: Bu instead just to gray it out and put a loader on top... Might be nicer.
15:18  SeriousJonny: but what mess up the position in first place?
15:18  peol: jumpy content (even if scrolled back to), is not good UX imo
15:18  peekaboo: Basically I have a table displaying data for a certain day
15:18  peekaboo: I change days... So I empty the div and reload it
15:18  SeriousJonny: well
15:18  peekaboo: It goes from over a page, to less than page..
15:18  SeriousJonny: why do you change its height?
15:19  peekaboo: I never set its height
15:19  peekaboo: I think peol  is right, this is just crappy practice of me
15:19  SeriousJonny: ic
15:19  peekaboo: I'll just gray it out and put a loader on top

15:21  RikudoSennin: 10*
15:22  peol: ? closest @ RikudoSennin

15:22  peol: and a selector with something like [id^="foo"]
15:24  peekaboo: ALso, is it bad practice to call a server side method to delet a record, and then just remove it from the html table instead of refreshing any actual data?
15:25  peekaboo: The server side method will return a bool.. And be post only

16:25  compaq: How do you delete image elements who src image are missing?
16:26  Cork[home]: compaq: you mean delete img tags with no src attribute or where the image couldn't load?
16:28  compaq: Cork[home], where image couldn't load, but if it takes a while, I want to wait, but if it doesn't find the src at all, it should leave an empty box
16:28  compaq: Cork[home], FF is cool, it automatically removes the element from the screen, but IE shows an empty box
16:29  compaq: Cork[home], sorry, I mean it should NOT leave an empty box
16:30  dabear: compaq: set the alt property to an empty string?
16:30  compaq: Cork[home], Actually, both, how do you delete image tags with no src attribute, cause then I can probably just add in the code, onerror='this.src=null' and delete them
16:30  peekaboo: Qhat's a nice site to learn jquery off?
16:30  compaq: dabear, that works for FF but IE still shows an empty box
16:31  unCork[home]: gah, stupid modem...
16:31 --- unCork[home] is now known as Guest89731
16:31  buddyq: compaq, you could always remove() the element.
16:31 --- Guest89731 is now known as Cork[home]
16:31  Cork[home]: compaq: you have a few options, bind onerror to the element, or if its after the element has loaded, you could create your own image object and copy the url to it and check onerror there
16:32  compaq: buddyq, how, cause they are loaded dynamically
16:32  Cork[home]: compaq: but onerror is the only way you can tell
16:32  compaq: hmm
16:33  compaq: Cork[home], I can't say that I know how to do either of those
16:33  Cork[home]: compaq: var newImage = $('<img/>'); newImage.error(function() { newImage.remove() }); newImage.attr('src', 'url');
16:34  Cork[home]: parent.append(newImage);
16:34  arik: Hey people
16:34  buddyq: hey compaq, this is exactly what you want I think: http://www.anujgakhar.com/2009/03/16/using-jquery-to-load-alternate-images/
16:34  compaq: Cork[home], remove() is good enough for me, so I could probably leave the last line out
16:35  compaq: Cork[home], so I just make that function, but how will it be triggerred.  It will just run everytime an <img> turns up?
16:36  arik: i have tiny simple Quetion: How do i place an icon near the DatePicker input - like little calendar?
16:36  compaq: Cork[home], Oh, I have to write that for every <img> I have
16:37  arik: someone?
16:37  arik: How do i place an icon near the DatePicker input - like little calendar?
16:37  dabear: calm down dude
16:37  buddyq: compaq, you have to write what for <img>? did you see the article I posted?
16:38  compaq: buddyq, yeah, but I have problem, because, a lot of my images are posted with append if a user clicks to see them
16:39  dabear: compaq: just do this serverside?
16:39  chrismcintosh: say i want to use bind to handle a click event, can i give it a function to call.  so say instead of $('.this').bind('click', function(){...});  I could have a function declared and pass it like this $('.this').bind('click', myClickFunc() );
16:40  compaq: dabear, it slow
16:40  compaq: dabear, why do people insist on server side so much, its wierd
16:40  dabear: compaq: you've tried for over a day now, better start thinking of alternative solutions
16:40  webben: compaq: Still trying to render some images?
16:40  dabear: chrismcintosh: yes, but remove the ()
16:41  chrismcintosh: okay
16:41  chrismcintosh: will the element that it is acting on be available as a this call like normal or do i need to pass that as an additional argument?
16:41  webben: compaq: 'why do people insist on server side so much' : robustness. latency. efficiency.
16:42  compaq: webben, yeah, you go enjoy, to each his own. go robust, laten, effic yourself
16:42  dabear: chrismcintosh: it will be available as the this element inside the function, ofcourse
16:42  compaq: var newImage = $('<img/>'); newImage.error(function() { newImage.remove() }); newImage.attr('src', 'url');
16:42  webben: compaq: You asked.
16:42  chrismcintosh: thanks was not sure
16:42  dabear: chrismcintosh: next time, ?tias
16:42  dabear: chrismcintosh: next time, see ?tias
16:42  bot-t: chrismcintosh, Try It And See
16:42  compaq: webben, going server side, to replace missing images is ok if you have a few, but I have tons
16:43  chrismcintosh: dabear: was trying it with the () and inside a ' ', but did not think to send just the name in
16:43  webben: compaq: To replace them? How about just not to serve them?
16:44  compaq: webben, forget it, help someone else on php or asp or somthing, I am playing with javascript here
16:44  webben: compaq: JS is used serverside too, but that's hardly the point.
16:44  dabear: chrismcintosh: functions are first class in js, meaning when you do function foo(){}; you can reference it as a variable, alter it etc
16:44  buddyq: compaq, so, seems like that should work no?
16:44  dabear: chrismcintosh: http://www.developerfusion.com/article/84433/first-class-functions/
16:44  compaq: webben, if you don't know, be quiet, why you telling people to give it up
16:44  webben: compaq: What was wrong with sean's JS-based approach, or XHR?
16:45  webben: compaq: If I don't know what exactly?
16:45  arik: Hey people - is it possible place an icon near the DatePicker input - like little calendar?
16:45  compaq: buddyq, no, cause that code runs at page load, but if you append images afterwards, it isn't going to run
16:45  compaq: webben, leave me alone buddy
16:45  compaq: webben, help arik
16:46  buddyq: arik, you get an icon and use css to place it.
16:46  buddyq: compaq, pastebin your code.
16:47  dabear: webben: just ignore compaq - he won't ever find a solution anyway :)
16:47  buddyq: you shyould be able to do it with a callback function after the images are put there dynamically
16:47  arik: so it's not a build-in  option in the date picker ?
16:47  dabear: unless he adops our advices, which he clearly won't
16:47  buddyq: arik, no
16:48  arik: ok. thank buddyq you save me a lot of frustration..\
16:53  compaq: buddyq, There isn't much code, it is just a for loop with append(<img.../>);  http://jsfiddle.net/8ejFX/
16:54  compaq: I'll leave the empty boxes if anything.  I am not gonna server side just to get rid of them for IE, cause they don't show up in FF.  But it is an easy fix to remove them.  Cork showed me how, but I don't understand the code to well
16:54  buddyq: compaq, you should put some html in there as well so it can work.
16:54  nlogax: and maybe don't do $('.bottom2') on each loop iteration
16:54  compaq: buddyq, is is just an append
16:56  buddyq: compaq, that builds the image tags but what is the functionality you want on each of those?
16:56  webben: compaq: In theory: $('.bottom2').delegate('img', 'error', function(){this.parentNode.removeChild(this);});
16:57  webben: compaq: (before your loop)
16:57  mekwall: hmm... weird! can't seem to change the color of the highlight effect
16:58  mekwall: .effect("highligh", { color: "#000000" }, 1000) <-- should work!'
16:58  compaq: buddyq, none, just post them
16:58  mekwall: highlight* :D
16:58  buddyq: compaq, i think webben, is right. delegate looks like the tool to use.
16:58  compaq: buddyq, I use http://jsfiddle.net/8ejFX/1/
16:58  buddyq: mekwall, missing a 't' on highlight?
16:59  mekwall: buddyq: I misspelled in here... the code is correct
16:59  prism: hey all could I use jquery to do a simple animation of a shape, lets say a circle with a point on it, could I 'spin' the circle without precaching a large amount of images somehow
16:59  compaq: webben, thanks, I wll try it out
16:59  mekwall: buddyq: also, it's doing the animation... but with the default yellow background
16:59  sean`: sio
17:00  webben: prism: In that JQuery doesn't restrict you from using JS to manipulate all the interfaces browsers give you, yes.
17:00  webben: prism: In that JQuery gives you specific tools for doing that out of the box, no.
17:00  prism: right - any idea what to look for
17:00  webben: prism: You probably want to be manipulating SVG/canvas/VML.
17:00  prism: got it, cheers webben
17:00  sean`: prism, jQuery's new CSS engine allowes you to use animate CSS3 options
17:01  sean`: There is a CSS rotate plugin, which will enable yhou to use .animate ({degrees/rotate: ..})
17:01  webben: prism: http://raphaeljs.com/ might be a decent place to start.
17:01  sean`: Not sure on the key it uses
17:01  h32Lg: how would you guys get the value of current line (curser line within a textarea) or the last line-value?
17:01  prism: thank you again webben
17:01  sean`: Luckely, this version is crossbrowser.. however, I'm not sure wether it'll be relaly fast
17:02  sean`: It was on the blog.jquery.com
17:02  sean`: see: https://github.com/lrbabe/jquery.rotate.js

18:23  Snerf: is there a way to run a function after an image has finished loading when I change it's src using $(img).attr('src', newsrc)  ?
18:26  losing: Snerf: img.load = function() { };
18:28  losing: img.onload*
18:28  Snerf: losing, would that also work with $('#something').load = fucntion.. ?
18:28  losing: Snerf: nope, that's jQuery's load function, it does something else
18:29  speg: There are 632 people in here?!
18:30  dabear: losing: actually, $("#something").load( function(){  }) is valid
18:30  dabear: and it does exactly the same as the native js event
18:30  losing: I thought it loaded HTML into the element
18:30  losing: http://jsfiddle.net/46VWp/
18:31  losing: dabear: load is an Ajax function
18:32  dabear: losing: yes?
18:32  losing: and we are talking about firing the onload event for an image
18:32  dabear: yes
18:32  dabear: go read the docs
18:32  dabear: .load does both
18:33  dabear: .load(function(){}) <-- bind to onload
18:33  dabear: .load("url", function(){}) <-- ajax
18:33  losing: TIL
18:34  speg: is there a way to do: $("#id").click(function(){$("#id).fadeOut();}) without having to use the selector again?
18:35  Brodingo: $(this)
18:35  dabear: speg: yes, $var id = $("#id");
18:35  dabear: speg: yes, var $id = $("#id");

18:43  jajmon: hello good sirs!
18:44  jajmon: i have a form in which ive replaced the submit button with a styled <a> tag
18:44  jajmon: my problem is that the form is no longer submittable via the enter key
18:44  Snerf: hmm, and an <img has an onload event as well
18:45  jajmon: whats the best way to make the enter key work when submitting the form, while still having my styled <a> as the submit button?
18:47  dabear: jajmon: easiest solution: restore the submit button, but set it to invisible. make a click on the anchor trigger a click on the submit button
18:48  jajmon: i tried that with display: none, but didnt work, maybe i should try visible: hidden?
18:48  jajmon: yes, that did work
18:48 --- unCork[home] is now known as Guest68093
18:48  jajmon: thanks alot dabear!
18:48  dabear: jajmon: why can't you use a submit button in the first place?
18:48  dabear: you can style that too
18:48 --- Guest68093 is now known as Cork[home]
18:51  Snerf: hmm, anyone here worked with jCrop, an image cropping tool?
18:52  jajmon: dabear, support for styling submit button is inconsistent across browsers :)
18:52  dabear: Snerf: nope, but what is your problem ? :)
18:52  jajmon: dabear, also im lazy :D
18:52  jajmon: for reference http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/styling-form-controls-revisited/submit-button/
18:53  jajmon: im not sure you can include images on the submit element as well, which i use on my buttons :)
18:53  jajmon: you can on the <button> element though
18:54  dabear: <input type="image"
18:55  jajmon: dabear, well not quite :) more lik ehttp://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/
18:55  jajmon: *like
18:57  Snerf: dabear, the problem is.. I have an <img and I set the .JCrop to the images id, and I set an initial selection area, but since the image is a bit large, it takes a little while to load, and then the selection for the jCrop disappears, so I tried attaching the jCrop to the image after it has fully loaded, no go, the initial selection disappears
18:58  Snerf: and that is using $('#croppedImage').load .. in using <img onload= event, all I see is the selection in the top corner as a single square.. its a little irritating
18:58  dabear: ?paste @ Snerf

20:19  peekaboo: How is best to gray out a table/div?

20:20  dabear: peekaboo: gray out everything or just any inputs inside that table/div?
20:20  peekaboo: The entire div
20:21  seirmubsa: Any idea how you can authenticate a client-side application written in a language like javascript with a remote server?
20:21  dabear: set a div with relative positioning to cover your entire table
20:21  dabear: and set it's z-index high
20:21  dabear: also, set background to gray and opacity to 80% or something like that
20:21  webben: seirmubsa: HTTP authentication is one option.
20:21  peekaboo: Perfect thanks
20:22  seirmubsa: But since it's implemented in javascript, wouldn't it be really easy to reverse engineer that?
20:22  webben: seirmubsa: Oh - you mean in such a way that the user doesn't log in?
20:22  webben: i.e. authenticating the app not the user?

20:29  aaroncicali: Hi everyone
20:29  SeriousJonny: hi all
20:32  aaroncicali: I'm not a fan of namespaced events, not because they don't make sense, but because my OCD doesn't like the look of them
20:32  aaroncicali: Am I crazy?
20:32  aaroncicali: don't answer that
20:32  sean`: Denicked?
20:32  snover: aaroncicali: yes.
20:33  aaroncicali: for a plugin I'm writing, I'd hate to see users have to .bind('ready.myPlugin') verses .bind('ready')
20:33  snover: It’s not obligatory.
20:33  sean`: It'
20:35  SeriousJonny: oo sean
20:35  SeriousJonny: jq soldier
20:35  SeriousJonny: howr ya doin
20:35  snover: You can attach a namespaced event and it will still trigger on the non-namespaced event name
20:35  dabear: afaik they don't have to bind to .myPLugin
20:36  dabear: like snover said ^^
20:36  sean`: SeriousJonny, good :-)

20:37  _numbers: i'm studying client-side heavy implementations of web apps. my biggest question is templating: is it better to render markup server-side and retrieve it via ajax, or engineer javascript functions to render markup client-side based on retrieved json data?
20:37  bot-t: (425 hours ago) <paul_irish> tell _numbers the jquery team is working on one.
20:37  _numbers: and are there tools to make the latter easier?
20:38  snover: _numbers: The latter, and jQuery.tmpl
20:38  snover: ?tmpl @ _numbers

20:38 --- johannes__ is now known as johanness
20:38  _numbers: also how does this compare to XSL/XSLT? World of WarCraft for example uses that technology on their web site. You can make entire blogs out of it, and everything happens client-side
20:39  snover: xslt blows.
20:40  _numbers: i see. well that settles it then. lol
20:40  snover: It is seriously one of the worst technologies ever.
20:40  snover: all its “variables” are immutable once you define them
20:40  SeriousJonny: how if the client is a bit slower
20:40  SeriousJonny: then this will lag out
20:40  SeriousJonny: the client
20:40  snover: SeriousJonny: what are you talking about?
20:40  vladikoff: there's serverside xslt
20:41  crab: snover: don't let the functional programmers hear you
20:41  vladikoff: if you love it so much
20:41  snover: nlogax and I are bros
20:42  SeriousJonny: what benefits would i have using xslt
20:42  rasu: hmm when i try debuging my site now i have a breakpoint on line 1 $(document).ready(function() { my debug in firebug will go to this line all time and i will never see the page. how does this work are the browser looping that function all time or have i some error?
20:43  m0dmd-sleep: e
20:43 --- m0dmd-sleep is now known as m0dmd
20:43  _numbers: there are a lot of downsides, actually. browsers are more likely to support JS than XSLT. it's also not very easy to read or write imho. i just know it was a technology with similar goals
20:43  aaroncicali: rasu: can you post your code to jsfiddle.net?
20:43  snover: SeriousJonny: There are no benefits.
20:44  snover: rasu: if you set a breakpoint, clear the breakpoint?
20:44  aaroncicali: not true... job security could be a potential benefit
20:44  aaroncicali: Employer: "We haven't been able to find anyone else that like XSLT, we'll have to keep SeriousJonny after all"
20:44  sean`: I'm not a fan of xslt either
20:45  aaroncicali: ;)
20:45  SeriousJonny: Disadvantages:* Browser support is all over the map. * Google won't thank you.
20:46  _numbers: ya seo... i have no idea but im sure its bad
20:46  _numbers: for xslt
20:46  _numbers: that is so depressing. so many technologies to choose from, so many cool new experimental things going on, but if you don't stick with ones that can be employed by pakis fresh off the programming boat, you're accused of trying to make yourself indispensable at the expense of the company.
20:46  sean`: lol
20:46  sean`: perhaps yuou shouldn't worry about technology but company
20:47  SeriousJonny: less time = win win
20:47  peekaboo: "paki's"
20:47  sean`: The only thing I can say is, don't hate, fornicate
20:48  aaroncicali: don't do either
20:48  sean`: You don't
20:48  sean`: doesn't mean others can't
20:49  snover: _numbers: In this case it has nothing to do freshman not being able to use it, and everything to do with experienced developers saying “FUCK THAT”
20:50  _numbers: i see a fork in the road. i can continue to experiment with cutting-edge solutions that give me more leverage as an individual to build my SaaS apps, or just stick with broadly-accepted generics and hire overseas labor to do it for me.
20:50  _numbers: for a long time i pursued the former, but im now leaning toward the latter
20:50  noobie25: if i have multiple scripts,   i'm unclear how i can access variables/functions "across the different scripts.   i posted a sample:  http://pastie.org/1330526
20:50  peekaboo: _numbers: Do what will allow you to synergise your productivity the most
20:50  peekaboo: noobie25: No such thing...
20:51  peekaboo: noobie25: Scripts aren't independant
20:51  crab: i suppose i am overseas labour

21:35  templaedhel: Is there another jquery function? Or do I need to do timeouts
21:35  snover: B|ackPanther: you asked what generates it, and the answer is wordpress
21:35  temp01: setTimeout
21:36  templaedhel: Ok
21:36  ajpiano: B|ackPanther, the jquery docs is XML that's maintained in wordpress :/
21:36  SeriousJonny: 3.6.12 = 3.6
21:36  chris1: why are you telling him wordpress ?
21:36  SeriousJonny: main problem is not the version, i guess its the dlls
21:36  SeriousJonny: this plugin use
21:37  SeriousJonny: WINNT_x86-msvc
21:37  B|ackPanther: ajpiano,  but there should be an XML generator they use right ?
21:37  ajpiano: there should be
21:37  ajpiano: but there isn't
21:37  ajpiano: it's just handwritten xml in wordpress
21:37  ajpiano: it's in the slow processs of being improved
21:38  chris1: wordpress sucks
21:38  B|ackPanther: ajpiano : Thanks. That was handy.
21:38  JKarsrud: templaedhel: What you could do is hide() and then call remove in the callback, though
21:39  templaedhel: JKarsrud: I am using css3 transitions though

21:46  aaroncicali: not much partying goin on over here
21:46  temp01: rasu: is your button getting appened by $('#table').html(data);?
21:47  temp01: appended
21:47  chris1: ajpiano: why do you spend hours and hours and months and months of your life helping people for free then?
21:47  ajpiano: altruism
21:47  SeriousJonny: well it doesnt rewrite the urls this is a little issue indeed :D
21:48  chris1: so by being a cocky douche tool who thinks they know it all, you feel you are helping others?

21:50  mortana: but it doesn't uncheck them

21:50  rasu: temp01: thanks i shall read
21:51  temp01: mortana: try using class?
21:51  mortana: how you mean?
21:51  snover: mortana: IDs are unique per-element, you know.
21:51  JKarsrud: mortana: Guess you'll need to check out live or delegate. They probably get added to the DOM at a later stage than your normal event binding, and then you won't be able to do anything with them :)

22:06  pigiman: //join #xpath
22:08  koichirose: hello
22:09  JKarsrud: hi there :)
22:12  koichirose: I'm having trouble with this code: https://gist.github.com/719303
22:13  aaroncicali: sounds problematic
22:13  koichirose: The hover function works fine. Then, when I click on a li, I'd like to unbind the hover and rebind it when I click again. The add/remove class bit works too.
22:14  aaroncicali: koichirose: what's the goal?  my guess is there's an easier way to make it work
22:15  koichirose: aaroncicali, hovering on a li changes the bg position of a span element (contained in the li)
22:15  aaroncicali: you can do that with CSS
22:15  koichirose: it's another element, not the one I'm hovering on
22:16  aaroncicali: but it's contained within the hovered element
22:16  aaroncicali: li: hover span { background-position: 0 -32px; }
22:16  aaroncicali: li:hover span { background-position: 0 -32px; }
22:16  aaroncicali: don't know where that space came from :)
22:18  koichirose: uhm..you're right. but since I have a big span (two rows with 16 elements, 32 elements total) and I just have to change the y position..is it worth it to use 16 css lines as opposed to a couple js ones?
22:18  Dracos_: you can use .toggleClass on the li onclcik
22:18  aaroncicali: yes, always CSS where it can be done
22:18  koichirose: Dracos_, I was using that. I switched to toggle() to bind and unbind
22:19  Dracos_: make the clicked class identical to the non-hover state
22:19  aaroncicali: it's much better than adding all sorts of event listeners.  What if you end up having 100 list items?  Performance will degrade.  With CSS it won't matter
22:19  Dracos_: yup
22:19  Dracos_: something like this:
22:20  koichirose: aaroncicali, ok. I'll do that. I think I'll have the same problem though. When I click on a li, I want it to stay in 'hover' state even when I mouseout
22:20  Dracos_: li span, li.clicked span {]
22:20  aaroncicali: so bind on the click, and add a class "opened"
22:20  aaroncicali: will you have many list items?
22:20  SeriousJonny: is it ok to include jq on bottom of the site?
22:21  Bar_: How can I make smooth animations ? Lets say to fade in a div, or to scroll it from the top of its parent element.. but I want it butter smooth... animate() is good enough ?
22:21  aaroncicali: sure, animate() is good enough
22:21  aaroncicali: mmm... butter
22:21  koichirose: lol
22:21  Bar_: it won't stuck on slow PCs etc etc ?
22:22  koichirose: aaroncicali, yes, many list items
22:22  Bar_: just animate the 'top' property ?
22:22  aaroncicali: ? delegate @ koichirose
22:22  bot-t: koichirose, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
22:23  Bar_: slideDown is just animate in disguise ? :)
22:23  aaroncicali: you should learn about event delegation if you haven't already.  Much better performance than binding to each <li>
22:23  koichirose: aaroncicali, ok.
22:23  koichirose: thanks
22:24  aaroncicali: Bar_: all jquery animation functions are just animate() in disguise
22:24  Bar_: aaroncicali: The better performance is even for small numbers of elements ?
22:24  Bar_: lets say <10 <li>'s ?
22:24  dabear: ?source slidedown
22:24  bot-t: Line#6546 - "slideDown: genFx("show", 1)," - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6546
22:24  aaroncicali: sorry Bar_... I was talking about binding event handlers, not animation
22:24  Bar_: aaroncicali: I understand, that was my question to you.
22:25  Bar_: aaroncicali: And about animation again :) should I use slideDown or my own animate() ? slideDown is somehow optimized and I shouldn't mess with animate to achieve something simliar ?
22:25  aaroncicali: oh.  well, technically anything more than 1 would benefit from delegation since there's usually less DOM traversal and less binding
22:26  Bar_: yeah but isn't that micro optimization ?
22:26  aaroncicali: what's wrong with slideDown()?  are you having problems with it?
22:27  aaroncicali: sure.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend delegation for just a few
22:27  aaroncicali: but if it's possible that your application may change to include more elements, delegation will be helpful
22:27  dabear: delegation has no performance concerns in practice
22:27  dabear: might as well use it everywhere
22:28  aaroncicali: that's what I say
22:28  Bar_: ok
22:28  Bar_: but if I have one element and its ID, I should just bind to it right ?
22:29  Bar_: like a button or something
22:29  aaroncicali: yes
22:30  aaroncicali: but it really depends on your application
22:30  Bar_: ok
22:30  Bar_: CSS3 transitions are faster than jquery animate ?
22:30  aaroncicali: not in IE8
22:31  Bar_: There's a jquery plugin that uses css3 transitions if they're available... should I use it ?
22:31  aaroncicali: is this the Bar exam?
22:31  aaroncicali: cause I really didn't study for it
22:31  Bar_: everyone are just using animate() and it's fine ? :| I really never used animation with jQuery before... It seems heavy
22:31  Bar_: lol
22:31  aaroncicali: what's heavy about it?
22:32  aaroncicali: Use it and see.  You don't have to marry it or anything.
22:32  Bar_: I'm just asking if that's the right way to go. No enchancements or other best practices ?
22:33  aaroncicali: none that I know of.  I try to use animation sparingly.  Things that I used to think were cool are now usually just annoying
22:33  aaroncicali: I usually opt for a show() / hide() with no duration
22:34  Bar_: that's really instantaneous :)
22:34  koichirose: aaroncicali, ok about delegate and performance issues. I still don't understand how to solve my 'hover' state problem. I now switched to CSS for the hover function.
22:39  mortana: I've got a table with cells, some with class A
22:39  mortana: I want an array containing all the values of the cells with class A
22:39  mortana: how can I do this?
22:39  peekaboo: mortana: With javascript
22:39  mortana: lol

22:43  SeriousJonny: js at bottom = faster rendering of site hmmm
22:44  JKarsrud: SeriousJonny: Yup
22:44  JKarsrud: loadng of JS is a blocking operation
22:44  SeriousJonny: so i include jq then my custom js
22:44  SeriousJonny: before </body>
22:45  JKarsrud: That will result in the rest of the page being loaded before the JS
22:45  SeriousJonny: well i use lots of pagespeed
22:45  SeriousJonny: didnt goes into that issue
22:45  SeriousJonny: but yslow does
22:46  SeriousJonny: but i dont see sites doing this
22:46  SeriousJonny: so i asked
22:46  SeriousJonny: is there a issue to load jq at bottom, normaly there shouldnt
22:46  JKarsrud: anyway, loading JS is a blocking operation, meaning that the browser will halt on loading a script, and only continue loading the rest of the page after the scripts are done
22:47  SeriousJonny: but i see there are really shitload of rules
22:47  SeriousJonny: http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/
22:48  JKarsrud: If you put your JS at the bottom, you make sure that the styling and content is rendered before any script is loaded
22:48  SeriousJonny: well i hit 85/100 at the project i work atm, and grade a-b on yslow on it i guess this is good enough :D
22:49  SeriousJonny: well for the next one my hobby site
22:49  SeriousJonny: i guess i will try to hit on both 100 and a
22:49  SeriousJonny: the only thing is cdn
22:50  SeriousJonny: i will try to use maxcdn for private
22:50  JKarsrud: tinycdn! :)
22:50  SeriousJonny: anyone got that maybe and can tell me if he is ok with it?
22:51  SeriousJonny: hmm free trial
22:51  aaroncicali: wait... downloading a JS file does not block downloads of other external dependencies
22:51  aaroncicali: koichirose: sorry, I was away from keyboard
22:51  wunderkin: i don't know standard pricing, but vps.net is doing level3 cdn for $35 for 1tb
22:52  SeriousJonny: maxcdn 30$ for 1tb too
22:52  aaroncicali: you've switched to CSS for hover states... now you just need to add an event listener for the click
22:52  SeriousJonny: but they dont have much nodes

23:15  wunderkin: after the discussion a bit ago i'm trying to convert to delegate.. is there a problem with using it on the toggle event? it works on the first click when using click.....
23:17  Cork[home]: mdance: $('div').click(function() { $(this).find('a').click(); });
23:18  Cork[home]: mdance: but remember that browsers make a difference between clicks the user does and you trigger through js
23:18  mdance: you mean related to history, etc.?
23:19  Cork[home]: mdance: some of the default actions won't trigger when you click a link through js
23:19  Cork[home]: so you will have to simulate them
23:20  mdance: Cork[home]: for some reason its not working
23:20  mdance: return $(this).find('a').click();
23:20  mdance: im debugging in chrome
23:21  mdance: i tried yours, and then added the return
23:21  Cork[home]: mdance: as i said, that will trigger then 1. jquery click function, 2. the js click event, but NOT the default click action
23:21  Cork[home]: then??the
23:21  Cork[home]: sigh
23:21  Cork[home]: then==the
23:21  mdance: it seems to be infinite looping into the same click function
23:22  nickelnick: i'm having some trouble selecting a hidden html section where i want to change the class of a hidden div.
23:22  Cork[home]: oh, ya you need to prevent bubbeling the click from the link
23:22  nickelnick: i've tried something like $('body').find(":hidden");
23:22  Cork[home]: mdance: else it will click on the div, then bubble up to the div, and start all over again
23:22  nickelnick: and
23:22  Cork[home]: uh.. forgot a part there :)
23:23  nickelnick: console.info($('div:hidden'));
23:23  Cork[home]: mdance: it will click the div, trigger the click on the link, then bubble up to the div, and start all over again
23:23  Cork[home]: mdance: a simple event.stopPropagation(); should do
23:24  nickelnick: tried also console.info($(':hidden').find('div'));
23:24  Cork[home]: nickelnick: what does $('div:hidden'
23:25  Cork[home]: $('div:hidden').length show?
23:25  nickelnick: undefined
23:26  mdance:  Cork: still having issues
23:26  nickelnick: oh wait

23:27  mdance:     $(this).find('a:href').click();
23:27  mdance:     event.stopPropagation();
23:27  mdance:   });
23:27  nickelnick: it says 1
23:27  mdance: i have tried the event.Stop before and after
23:27  jedimind_: mdance, probably not a good idea to paste things directly into th echan
23:27  mdance: jedi: ok
23:27  Cork[home]: mdance: no you miss undestood, you need to catch events on the link, and prevent it from bubbling
23:27  Cork[home]: not on the div
23:27  jedimind_: .click( function(e) { e.preventDefault(); })
23:27  jedimind_: i didnt read what the problem was
23:28  Cork[home]: nickelnick: and you want to show it or what?
23:28  nickelnick: i want to assign the class of "current" to the div
23:29  nickelnick: the correct div
23:29  nickelnick: main div goes hidden along with whole site saying #undefined in browser address
23:29  nickelnick: this is for JQtouch
23:31  Cork[home]: nickelnick: so $('div:hidden').addClass('current'); ?
23:32  nickelnick: yea but there are a couple hidden divs....i dont wan thte first one
23:33  nickelnick: i want one with specific id
