01:34  bot-t: SugaSlide, Okay.
01:35  bartzy: My problem is that my page is inside an iframe, and when I drag the handle with the mouse outside of the iframe, when I return to the dragging space, the handle seems like it is still clicked
01:35  bartzy: any idea ?
01:35  bartzy: I tried iframeFix: true, but this didn't help.

01:44  seancurtis: Ok I need to ask you guys for a sanity check. We were going to use Conditional comments to add classes to the <html> tag for IE versions, but realised we then can't target FF/Webkit if we need specific CSS fixes for those browsers (yes we have run into enough FF/Webkit bugs to warrant this). Our current idea is to apply a browser class to the html tag via JS (JS required for the app). Anyone got any alternative ideas/methods of achieving this
01:45  pedramphp: does anyone has better solution that cufos for fonts
01:45  miketaylr: and what happens if you're not using IE, webkit, or firefox, seancurtis?
01:46  pedramphp: ?
01:46  arex\: If I want to unbind(), click() then bind() the handler that I just unbound, how would I do it? I need to save the first handler before i unbind() so i can bind('click', oldHandler)
01:48  arex\: Example: http://www.jsfiddle.net/arex1337/DPj8K/1/
01:48  seancurtis: miketaylr: we have specific browsers we support - if they're not using one of them then we can't guarantee a flawless experience. We try to code as close to the standards as possible but sometimes things just play up.
01:48  seancurtis: miketaylr: Opera seems to play nice for most stuff
01:48  miketaylr: ;)
01:49  expilicious: just out of interest, which font rendering style do you peeps prefer : http://imgur.com/a/4Zrvv
01:49  miketaylr: thats a tricky question, seancurtis
01:49  seancurtis: most of our browser-fixes are really edge case stuff though - mainly for polish :)
01:49  miketaylr: i've used media query h4x for webkit/ff specific stuff in the past
01:49  miketaylr: but just for small tweaks
01:49  seancurtis: expilicious: the first one
01:49  expilicious: are you a mac or windows user seancurtis?
01:50  seancurtis: miketaylr: currently we make use of some of Paul's fantastic browser-targeting css selector hax
01:50  seancurtis: but we'd like to move away from that and be able to just do .ff .foo {...} or .ie9 .foo {...}
01:50  seancurtis: expilicious: osx
01:50  miketaylr: yeah
01:50  seancurtis: expilicious: windows prior to this year
01:51 --- wunz_ is now known as wunz
01:51  seancurtis: miketaylr: it's a large app and we have a lot of people working on the codebase - thinking that the dev speed benefits and clarity provided by a classname would outweigh the obscurity of using a combination of IE conditional comments and media queries
01:52  seancurtis: curious to know if there are any other ways of approaching this besides ua sniffing
01:52  coldhead: hey seancurtis, glad to see i didn't miss you at sydjs :)
01:52  seancurtis: coldhead: I was spewing I missed that one :(
01:52  seancurtis: it looked fcking awesome
01:52  miketaylr: going down the path of ua sniffing is dangerous...
01:52  coldhead: they had 4 women there!
01:53  miketaylr: too many!
01:53  seancurtis: miketaylr: yeah we really don't want to go anywhere near ua sniffing
01:53  expilicious: it's the same font, monaco, first is rendered in windows, the second is osx's way of rendering the same font, but i'm using GDI++ for windows to test, so I don't know how accurate it is
01:53  coldhead: CRAZY!
01:53  seancurtis: coldhead: women? Lies!
01:53  seancurtis: coldhead: sure they weren't just the cleaners?
01:53  coldhead: >: |
01:54  seancurtis: I'll make sure I go to the next one
01:54  coldhead: they may have done light cleaning in addition to their JS discussions
01:54  seancurtis: but I'm betting it won't be anywhere near as good as the last one :(
01:54  coldhead: i won't deny them that
01:54  seancurtis: did you go?
01:54  coldhead: no sir, didn't RSVP in time
01:54  seancurtis: bah just rock up ;)
01:54  seancurtis: mind you I heard it was a full house
01:55  seancurtis: should invite Mr Souders more often :P
01:56  coldhead: it was like a web directions south side show
01:57  miketaylr: you dudes know lachlan hardy?
01:57  miketaylr: he's gonna present something at bk.js on tuesday
01:58  coldhead: he's a good guy
01:58  coldhead: way to go, brooklyn
01:59  miketaylr: yeah, he's down for brooklyn beta so we nabbed him to drop some knowledge while he's around
01:59  seancurtis: miketaylr: used to work with him - he's pretty awesome
01:59  miketaylr: sweet! he seems rad
01:59  seancurtis: knows his shit and good at presenting
01:59  seancurtis: sounds like the airlines screwed his flight seating up though :(
02:00  miketaylr: ruh roh
02:03  bartzy: Hi, I have a problem with UI draggable only with firefox.. anyone else has any problems with it ?
02:03  bartzy: all other browsers works as expected
02:04  seancurtis: bartzy: what problem are you experiencing?
02:04  seancurtis: bartzy: any errors in the console?
02:04  bartzy: seancutis: no errors. let me explain:
02:04  coldhead: someone else was complaining about drag lag in Fx just yesterday
02:04  bartzy: seancurtis: I have a draggable (no resizeable or sortable or droppable...) that has a containment object
02:05  bartzy: all this (and all my JS code) is inside an iframe
02:05  bartzy: as long as I'm dragging inside the iframe, all is good.
02:06  bartzy: But if I click the mouse and drag with the pointer outside of the iframe, then when I come back (even if I released the mouse button), the dragging continues ... All other browsers (Chrome, Opera, IE8) don't do that, they stop the dragging and don't continue it when I returned to the containment object
02:06  coldhead: doing anything across iframe boundaries is tricky
02:06  bartzy: coldhead: I don't want to do anything across iframe boundaries.
02:06  coldhead: oh right
02:06  bartzy: Just don't want to continue dragging when the user comes back from outside of the iframe
02:07  bartzy: coldhead: Also, every other browser works, so I guess it's a quirk in FF, hope someone here knows something about it :\
02:07  seancurtis: bartzy: you are doing things across iframe boundaries - you probably need to do some funky iframe communication to trigger an event that will stop the draggable
02:08  bartzy: seancurtis: Why all other browsers work as usual ? Any idea ?
02:08  bartzy: seancurtis: Also, how can I trigger an event for when the mouse leaves the iframe ?
02:08  seancurtis: bartzy: dragging across iframe boundaries is something I'd consider extremely likely to exhibit weird behaviour between browsers
02:08  bartzy: (I only have access to stuff inside the iframe)
02:09  bartzy: seancurtis: Again, I'm not dragging outside iframe bounaries
02:09  bartzy: seancurtis: The dragging stops at the containment object.
02:09  seancurtis: bartzy: you are - you're starting a drag inside an iframe, then dragging outside the iframe
02:09  bartzy: but when I return to the containment object, the dragging continues.
02:09  seancurtis: bartzy: start logging some events on the iframe
02:09  bartzy: seancurtis: No.
02:09  seancurtis: see if it triggers a drag stop when leaving the iframe...
02:09  seancurtis: or whatever the event is
02:09  bartzy: seancurtis: I don't drag outside the iframe, because it has a containment object.
02:10  bartzy: how can I log events ?
02:10  rchern: i've got an element that has .live("click",fn). but if i look at the element's .data("events") it reports null. also doing element.click() doesn't seem to trigger the event. am i missing something tricky with .live() ?
02:10  seancurtis: hrm what you could do is wrap the contents of the iframe in a div with 1px on all sides
02:10  seancurtis: then get that element to stop the drag event
02:11  seancurtis: so it acts as a buffer for the iframe content...
02:11  seancurtis: rchern: live binds to the document I believe
02:11  seancurtis: try element.trigger('click')
02:11  seancurtis: dunno why .click() wouldn't work though
02:11  rchern: i did. again, nothing.
02:11  bartzy: seancurtis: That's pretty weird :p
02:12  bartzy: seancurtis: It's so weird that from all browsers, FF is the mess...
02:12  bartzy: I didn't find anything online... All iframe & draggable talk was only about dragging into iframes ..
02:12  seancurtis: bartzy: there's probably a reason - or it could be a legit bug :)
02:12  rchern: note that if i actually click on the element it does trigger >_>
02:13  seancurtis: rchern: if that's the case then maybe look at your JS that's targeting the element
02:13  rchern: look for?
02:13  bartzy: seancurtis: So I'm stuck ? :)
02:13  seancurtis: rchern: is the element on the page when you're triggering the click? Often people use live when loading content via ajax - have you tried logging element.length before the click to see if it's actually there
02:13  seancurtis: bartzy: try doing the buffer thing I mentioned
02:14  rchern: yes the element is on the page
02:14  seancurtis: wrap the contents of the body in a div with 1px padding
02:14  seancurtis: then when you mouseenter that div cancel the drag
02:14  coldhead: that sounds like a good approach
02:14  bartzy_: seancurtis: Sorry, I was disconnected, can you repeat your messages ?
02:14  seancurtis: rchern: not sure then - can you put a demo up?
02:14  coldhead: take matters into your own hands
02:15  seancurtis: seancurtis: wrap the contents of the body in a div with 1px padding
02:15  seancurtis: [11:14am] seancurtis: then when you mouseenter that div cancel the drag
02:15  seancurtis: coldhead: any alternative suggestions?
02:15  bartzy_: how can I easily wrap my iframe with a div 1px ?
02:15 --- linusoleander_ is now known as linusoleander
02:15  seancurtis: bartzy_: don't you control the content of the iframe?
02:15  bartzy_: just <div></div> on the entire iframe ?
02:15  bartzy_: I do
02:15  rchern: seancurtis: it is SO's chat app
02:15  seancurtis: bartzy_: wrap the body contents of the iframe with a div
02:16  seancurtis: rchern: SO = stack overflow?
02:16  bartzy_: seancurtis: so why that div need 1px padding ?
02:16  bartzy_: seancurtis: Can't I just bind mouseenter on <body> ?
02:16  seancurtis: well if it's flush with the iframe edge you won't trigger any events for leaving it?
02:17  rchern: $("#message-243863 span.action-link").data("events") >> null, $("#message-243863 span.action-link").length >> 1, $(".action-link").live("click", ta);
02:17  seancurtis: bartzy_: yeah I guess you could do that :)
02:17  rchern: seancurtis: aye.
02:17  bartzy_: OK... I'll try. thanks.
02:17  bartzy_: How can I trigger a drag stop ?
02:17  bartzy_: I don't see it in the docs
02:18  bartzy_: there's only a dragstop event, but not method
02:18  seancurtis: dunno - try $('.selector').trigger('dragstop'); ?
02:19  seancurtis: anyone else know how to programatically stop a jQuery UI Draggable?
02:19  seancurtis: bartzy_: maybe mouseup?
02:19  seancurtis: dunno
02:19  bartzy_: OK thanks I'll try trigger('dragstop')
02:19  rchern: seancurtis: http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/103/script-testing
02:20  bartzy_: seancurtis: Listening on mouseenter is a performance hit ?
02:20  seancurtis: rchern: can't chat - need 20 reputation
02:20  seancurtis: bartzy_: nfi
02:20  bartzy_: nfi ?
02:20  seancurtis: mousemove is heavy - not sure about mouseenter
02:20  bartzy_: seancurtis: I mean - Should I check to do it only on FF (because all others are working), or just do it for all browsers and that's it
02:21  seancurtis: bot-t: ? nfi
02:21  bartzy_: anyone knows ? :P
02:21  bot-t: seancurtis, .Net « All About SharePoint - https://littletalk.wordpress.com/category/net/
02:21  seancurtis: bartzy_: shouldn't hurt triggering it on others
02:21  bartzy_: OK
02:21  seancurtis: but you can target FF only if you want :)
02:21  bartzy_: It's a pretty heavy JS page
02:21  seancurtis: bot-t: define nfi
02:21  bot-t: seancurtis, Did you mean NF?  - (abbreviation) Newfoundland and Labrador, a Canadian province.
02:21  snover: mouseenter doesn’t bubble…
02:21  seancurtis: hrm
02:21  bartzy_: lol
02:21  seancurtis: nfi = no fucking idea :)
02:22  bartzy_: lol
02:22  rchern: seancurtis: no worries, but should still work as a live demo
02:22  bartzy_: snover: So it's not performance consuming ?
02:22  snover: that’s a generic fucking question :P
02:22  bartzy_: seancurtis: Anyway special to target only FF (or any other browser for that matter ?:))
02:22  snover: bartzy_: DO NOT BROWSER SNIFF.
02:22  bartzy_: snover: OK OK.. but then I must bind mouseenter on <body> on all browsers (even though all browsers except FF work)
02:23  snover: bartzy_: what is the problem you are experiencing?
02:23  snover: If Firefox is the only browser not doing what you expect then you are probably doing something wrong
02:23  arex\: I assume textfield.val('asdasd') doesn't trigger typing events?
02:23  bartzy_: snover: Yes I thought so too. I'll explain the problem:
02:24  seancurtis: rchern: I did $('#message-10600 .action-link').trigger('click'); and it worked fine :/
02:24  bartzy_: snover: I'm using UI Draggable (only draggable) inside an iframe. The draggable has a containment object. When I drag inside the iframe, everything is good. But when I drag and then go with the mouse outside the iframe, and only outside I release the click, then when I come back to the dragging space, the dragging continues....
02:24  arex\: Using jQuery how can I type something into a field? (Not just setting the value, but trigger typing events.)
02:25  bartzy_: snover: All other browsers work as I expect (meaning they don't continue dragging when I come back)
02:25  seancurtis: snover: FF isn't cancelling the draggable when he leaves the iframe
02:25  seancurtis: guessing the dragstop isn't firing
02:25  snover: oh
02:25  snover: that.
02:25  seancurtis: suggested triggering the dragstop on mouseenter of the iframe body
02:25  snover: yeah, that is a firefox bug. :|
02:25  bartzy_: snover: Then seancurtis suggested I'd bind mouseenter to <body> of the iframe
02:26  seancurtis: snover: suggested workaround?
02:26  snover: I don’t think the workaround would harm any of the other browsers
02:26  bartzy_: snover: Thanks for confirming. Maybe you have a bug link ? I tried to find something without success...
02:27  rchern: seancurtis: gah. so saying span.action-link rather than .action-link is what makes it not work. why does it break it though?
02:27  bartzy_: snover: And triggering dragstop is as simple as .trigger('dragstop') ?
02:27  seancurtis: arex\: I'm guessing either loop over the desired val character by character and trigger keypress events each time
02:27  snover: bartzy_: It happens with Flash objects, so I dunno if it is specific to embedded objects or window contexts or what
02:27  seancurtis: arex\: unless you can trigger a keypress with data that somehow adds that character in
02:27  bartzy_: snover: So listening on mouseenter on all browsers won't probably hurt ?
02:28  seancurtis: rchern: maybe you weren't being specific enough - were you triggering it on all span.action-links?
02:28  seancurtis: rchern: guessing if you have more than one on the page the little popup script may have issues
02:28  arex\: seancurtis: i guess i should trigger keydown, keypress, keyup and change for each character?
02:28  seancurtis: arex\: have you googled for a plugin - guessing someone has written one to solve this before
02:28  snover: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597106 is about all I can find
02:29  arex\: seancurtis: i have not
02:29  snover: let me try a couple more searches
02:29  n20: How does one center an element with jQuery?
02:29  rchern: no. i was using the selector i pasted into the room. "#message-id span.action-link" does nothing. "#message-id action-link" does work. both report a .length of 1
02:29  seancurtis: n20: use css?
02:29  rchern: erm *.action-link
02:29  bartzy_: snover: thanks a lot.
02:29  seancurtis: n20: vertical or horizontal centering?
02:29  snover: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78976
02:29  snover: there you go
02:29  snover: open since 2001
02:29  snover: woot
02:29  seancurtis: lol
02:29  n20: seancurtis: It's a self-made modal, that's supposed to hover over the page. Both would be great. :)
02:30 --- linusoleander_ is now known as linusoleander
02:30  seancurtis: n20: tried googling? you need to detect screen size, modal size and then do some dynamic calculations - then bind something to the window resize to reposition it
02:30  seancurtis: n20: why not use an existing modal plugin?
02:31  seancurtis: where people have already coded all that up? :)
02:31  snover: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=603550 too
02:31  n20: seancurtis: I'm pretty stubborn when it comes to using stuff like that, I tend to try to make it on my own. :-(
02:32  bartzy_: 2001 :|
02:32  n20: seancurtis: In case of me actually selling a website in the future, it would feel wrong using someone else's code.
02:32  bartzy_: I use FF 3.6.6 and it happens
02:34  pedramphp: border:0 or border:none ?
02:35  arex\: seancurtis: i can't find any such plugin
02:36  rchern: heh. works in the test room at least but not in a "real" room
02:36  bartzy_: snover: $('#draggable').trigger('dragstop') doesn't stop the drag
02:37  snover: bartzy_: trigger a mouseup on document
02:37  bartzy_: ok
02:37  seancurtis: bartzy_: tried using FF4 beta? Be interesting to see if it's fixed in that
02:38  seancurtis: arex\: I did a quick look but also couldn't find anything - why do you need to simulate progressive keystrokes?
02:38  bartzy_: snover, seancurtis: mouseup on document works. ruining some functionality but it works
02:38  arex\: seancurtis: because i need to simulate normal browser behaviour
02:39  bartzy_: seancurtis, snover: Because now if the user clicks and leaves the iframe and won't let go of the click, the drag will stop.. whereas it won't stop on browsers other than FF without the mouseup fix.
02:39  snover: seancurtis: the last bug I pasted indicates more breakage, not less
02:39  seancurtis: arex\: then maybe loop over the val char by char and trigger events on each loop?
02:39  arex\: seancurtis: i have a button that says "type ASDF into that text field", and I need the button to do it the "normal" way
02:39  snover: bartzy_: check the button state
02:39  arex\: seancurtis: yes im writing a jquery plugin for it now
02:39  bartzy_: snover: Weird that just FF has this problems... normally it's the solid-one...
02:40  bartzy_: snover: How ?
02:40  snover: maybe you can’t
02:40  snover: it would be like event.button === 1 or so
02:40  bartzy_: what event ? mouseenter ?
02:40  bartzy_: I'll log just a sec
02:42  bartzy_: snover: event.button is 0 doesn't matter if I keep click or not
02:42  snover: alert('do not move mouse outside iframe')
02:43  bartzy_: lol
02:43  bartzy_: die bugs die
02:44  bartzy_: I guess I'll just use it with the bug until Mozilla fix it
02:44  bartzy_: thanks a lot snover & seancurtis
02:44  snover: it’s only 11 years old, I am sure it will fixed any day now
02:44  snover: oops, I accidentally a word
02:45  seancurtis: lol
02:45 --- cerber0s is now known as cerberos
02:46  bartzy_: yeah 11 years is nothing... :p

03:32  jkirsop: Hi everyone, I'm using .animate to move a object left and right within the page via a mouseclick. I'd like to be able to limit the amount it can move left and right (so, eg, after moving 500px to the left it wont move any more). would a callback be the best way of going about that?
03:32  vIkSiT: hi all
03:32  vIkSiT: I'm trying to use $().load() to attach a click event to a div.
03:33  vIkSiT: however, this doesn't seem to fire for me!
03:33  vIkSiT: firefox and chrome on linux. Has anyone faced similar problems?
03:33  snover: ?faq events @ vIkSiT
03:33  bot-t: vIkSiT, FAQ: Why do my events stop working after an AJAX request? - http://tr.im/jqfaq2_1
03:34  snover: jkirsop: no, clamping the value of 'left' would be the best way of going about that.
03:35  jkirsop: clamping? (I just googled 'jquery clamping' and didn't find anything useful quickly)
03:36  vIkSiT: snover, hmm, thanks for the link, I'm not sure if that helps me though.
03:36  snover: ?mdc Math.max @ jkirsop
03:36  bot-t: jkirsop, max - Returns the largest of zero or more numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max
03:36  snover: ?mdc Math.min @ jkirsop
03:36  bot-t: jkirsop, min - Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min
03:36  snover: I always get those confused…
03:37  vIkSiT: In this case, I'm trying to attach the event after the div loads. The problem I'm facing is that the event doesn't fire on div load..
03:37  vIkSiT: or perhaps I'm missing something?
03:39  snover: vIkSiT: There is no “load” event for elements other than iframe and img.
03:39  snover: and window
03:39  snover: .
03:39  vIkSiT: aah
03:39  robertor: hi everyone!
03:39  vIkSiT: snover, so in this case, what would you recommend I do?
03:40  snover: vIkSiT: Use the ajax callback property in the way it is meant to be used.
03:40  snover: vIkSiT: The documentation I just linked you to says what to do.
03:40  vIkSiT: hrm.
03:41  robertor: i have a doubt with the tab widget. How can i define a size of the "body" of the tab? actually i have defined 3 tabs, but it are using all thw width of the screen
03:41  vIkSiT: snover, I'm guessing you're talking about using the callback that is part of jQuery's ajax fetch?
03:41  snover: robertor: using css.
03:42  burin: sorry to interrupt :) i forked jquery-mobile, fixed some typos on a doc page, and have committed the changes locally, then did a push to my fork. what's the "proper" thing to do to have these small changes pulled at this point?
03:42 --- ocf is now known as Guest55999
03:42  robertor: snover... and do you know what i have to change?
03:42  snover: ?g github pull request @ burin
03:42  bot-t: burin, Help.GitHub - Sending pull requests - http://help.github.com/pull-requests/
03:43  snover: robertor: the jquery ui documentation and/or firebug and/or developer tools will tell you.
03:44  robertor: :-)
03:44  burin: thanks snover! i didn't create a "topic branch" (used to subversion here) and am just working from master: think that'll be a problem?
03:44  snover: burin: yes. never ever do anything from master.
03:45  snover: burin: Once you commit to your master branch you can never do a fast-forward merge again
03:45  snover: burin: Which means you can never submit pull requests again without every single past commit coming with them
03:46  snover: you should rename your master branch to something else and check out a new master branch from upstream
03:46  snover: I guess I will write a tutorial on how to do this since you are the third person (myself included) to fall into this trap
03:46  burin: snover: i'm glad i started with something small like typos ;)
03:47  snover: GitHub does a bad job of warning you not to work on the master branch of a project that exists upstream
03:47  burin: i actually wanted to start small in case there were any traps i'd fall into before i did any "real" contribution haha
03:50  snover: burin: You’ll get the hang of it eventually; it is fairly annoying coming from a svn background to remember the different names for things
03:52  ldexterldesign: hey guys. just relaunched my website: http://www.ldexterldesign.co.uk/ - love to get thoughts. thanks!
03:52  burin: snover: i'm going through a few of the github help docs to see what direction to go in. i don't mind starting over, since what i did was so minor.
03:52  jkirsop: snoover, using those max and min functions, would I need to get the current value of 'left' and see if it's within a certain range (ie. clamp it??), and then run the jquery as follows: $("#scrollEventsLeft").click(function(){$("#scrollingEventsList").animate({"left": "-=306px"}, "slow");}); if it's within the range?
03:52  snover: burin: Their docs ok, but a little confusing. definitely not awesome. there is another thing somewhere that is an article that shows the git and svn commands side by side
03:53  snover: jkirsop: why are you using relative animation?
03:53  snover: jkirsop: also, no. I can’t really handhold you through this though, I am sure you will figure it out
03:54  jkirsop: snoover, I just took that from the jquery documentation, as it looked like it'd to what I want it to do.
03:54  jkirsop: and then modified it..
03:54  snover: jkirsop: do not copy and paste code
03:55  snover: I mean, avoid it
03:55  snover: play around with how animate works instead first so you actually understand it
03:55  snover: and read the docs
03:56  jkirsop: absolute positioning wouldn't work AFAIK because clicking on the button to move the element multiple times wouldn't work? as clicking it the first time would move it to the absolute position and subsequent clicks would have no effect as the object is already at that position
03:57  vIkSiT: hmm, does $(window).load not work in IE?
03:57  vIkSiT: snover, btw, I got my script to work by putting in a $(window).load and attaching using that.
03:57  vIkSiT: thanks for the link on event bubbles
03:57  vIkSiT: caveat - only works on FF and chrome. Still stuck w.r.t IE!
03:57  snover: vIkSiT: you are definitely doing it wrong.
03:58  vIkSiT: snover, as in?
03:58  plantian: Hi, is anyone using this?  Also if there is any chance are any of the owners here?  http://code.google.com/p/openid-selector/
03:58  snover: vIkSiT: If you are delaying script until window.load you are doing it wrong. use window.ready. furthermore, if you are using window.ready to attach events to data that is retrieved via ajax, unless you are delegating events, you are really really doing it wrong.
03:59  snover: plantian: what does openid have anything at all to do with jquery? at all?
03:59  plantian: snover: its an openid selector written in jquery
03:59  vIkSiT: snover, let me address that in two parts. For window.load vs ready - doesn't the former imply that all elements have finished loading, whereas the latter implies that the DOM is ready?
04:00  snover: vIkSiT: what do you perceive as being the difference between “all elements” and “the DOM”?
04:00  plantian: snover: I guess you haven't used it. 1 down, 588 to go
04:00  vIkSiT: DOM tree construction in memory vs loading media and other elements such as stylesheets for those elements?
04:00  coldhead: oh you poor innocent
04:01  vIkSiT: coldhead, moi?
04:01  vIkSiT: :)
04:01  coldhead: no just in general
04:01  coldhead: sorry, wrong window
04:01  vIkSiT: hehe ok.
04:02  vIkSiT: snover, is that a flawed assumption?
04:02  snover: vIkSiT: pretty much the only things not loaded by document.ready time are external image/frame/object assets
04:03  vIkSiT: snover, so a quick clarification - if an external JS is adding a new DIV to the dom tree, it would be captured by window.ready?
04:03  snover: vIkSiT: adding it how?
04:03  snover: ajax?
04:03  snover: or document.write?
04:03  vIkSiT: the latter. document.write
04:04  snover: never do that.
04:04  vIkSiT: snover, unfortunately, not my code. I'd have used .ajax
04:04  snover: The DOM is not built until after document.write because document.write modifies the text stream that is used to build the DOM.
04:04  vIkSiT: I see.
04:05  vIkSiT: so this is what I see. On Chrome and IE, adding an alert($(mydivtobeloaded).html()) shows null if I use $(window).ready, but works if I use load
04:08  snover: vIkSiT: sounds more like a race condition than a solution to me.
04:09  vIkSiT: snover, completely agree
04:09  vIkSiT: it works at times and other times, not.
04:09  snover: document.write can’t be done after the DOM is ready, however.
04:09  snover: Like, if something tries, it will delete the entire page.
04:09  snover: can’t be done.
04:09  vIkSiT: ah.
04:10  vIkSiT: so what do you recommend as a clean method to deal with this?
04:11  vIkSiT: of course, this always works with firefox, just not with chrome or IE
04:12  coldhead: i wish i knew what to have for lunch
04:12  vIkSiT: coldhead, which country are you in?
04:13  coldhead: australia
04:14  vIkSiT: not a pie floater then :)
04:14  plantian: coldhead: fried fish tacos if that's available
04:15  OhaiBBQ: have some rice coldhead
04:17  coldhead: a fish burrito with rice

04:18  destinydriven: coldhead: blueberry cheesecake and then cherry for dessert
04:18  coldhead: oh my god
04:18  snover: vIkSiT: I don’t know, I don’t know what your code looks like :)

04:24  vIkSiT: snover, aah. its using document.appendchild
04:25  snover: then you can’t do anything.
04:25  snover: other than poll.
04:25  snover: or fix the code.
04:25  vIkSiT: hmm
04:25  vIkSiT: the first option - a recursive poll?!
04:25  burin: snover: i started over from scratch, followed a guide, and submitted a pull request from a topic branch :) (guide mentioned http://phonegap.pbworks.com/Git:-Contributor-Workflow)
04:25  vIkSiT: snover, er, I mean - isn't that rather flawed?
04:26 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
04:26  vIkSiT: snover, and this won't be captured in document.load either, I guess
04:26  snover: vIkSiT: If elements are being added non-deterministically to the page without any event dispatch to indicate it has occurred that is the only thing you can do…
04:27  vIkSiT: sigh. true
04:27  snover: by the way, appendChild can’t happen until the DOM is ready too
04:27  vIkSiT: hmm
04:27  vIkSiT: yes, so perhaps I can wait for the dom ready. and then check for the child.
04:27  snover: burin: nice find!
04:28  vIkSiT: snover, btw, what would you use if you had to scrap this appendchild method and do it properly instead?
04:29  snover: vIkSiT: there’s nothing wrong with using appendchild, but it sounds like you need a pubsub so it can tell your application when it’s done something
04:29  vIkSiT: ah I see
04:30  vIkSiT: snover, could you elaborate on the pubsub a bit? (link to some resource/faq perhaps?)
04:30  snover: ?w pubsub @ vIkSiT
04:30  bot-t: vIkSiT, PubSub - PubSub may refer to: PubSub (website), Publish/subscribe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubSub
04:30  snover: sigh
04:30  snover: ?w publish/subscribe @ vIkSiT
04:30  bot-t: vIkSiT, Publish/subscribe - Publish/subscribe (or pub/sub) is a messaging pattern where senders (publishers) of messages are not programmed to send their messages to specific receivers (subscribers). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe
04:34  aaroncampbell: If there is a file with code like this: wpList = {parseClass: function(e,t) {...},...} is there a way for me to override one of the functions (like parseClass in this case) without actually editing that file (it's and external project that I'd like to not mess with)
04:34  Vorspire: load the file into memory and make the edits there
04:35  OhaiBBQ: wpList.parseClass = function() { ... } ?
04:35  aaroncampbell: OhaiBBQ: I'll try that syntax...thanks
04:39  aaroncampbell: OhaiBBQ:  wpList is not defined...I think it's because I just saw that the code is actually more like this: (function($) { wpList = {parseClass: function(e,t) {...},...} ; $.fn.wpList = function( settings ) {}; })(jQuery);
04:40  aaroncampbell: I'm assuming that the wrapping there basically segments the code out so that the global namespace isn't polluted?
04:40  OhaiBBQ: ya, do you have a link to the file?
04:40  aaroncampbell: Is there still a way to get at it?
04:40  aaroncampbell: OhaiBBQ: Sure

04:45  OhaiBBQ: i thought the code would be different, i'll mess with it
04:46  vIkSiT: snover, question on pubsub.
04:47  vIkSiT: If the JS that populates the data is independent of the JS where the event handlers are being added..
04:47  vIkSiT: can that model still work?
04:47  vIkSiT: I guess the pub/sub would have to be through async requests? ugh. cross domain crap too, may come in

06:35  icek: and it shouldnt grow it just move it
06:36  Vorspire: ok
06:39  Vorspire: (icek): can't seem to trace the code back to the place where it expands that element
06:41 --- jurica_ is now known as jurica
06:42  Vorspire: (icek): nvm i got it, one sec
06:42  icek: ?
06:42  icek: ohhh
06:43  Vorspire: (icek): you know this code: jQuery("#pageflip img").stop()
06:44  icek: yeah
06:45  icek: Vorspire yea
06:45  Vorspire: try: jQuery("#pageflip > img").stop()
06:46  Vorspire: sec while i jsfiddle this
06:46  Vubi: i did a quick accordion with jquery without UI
06:48  icek: yo Vorspire i changed it
06:48  icek: kinda broke it
06:49  Vorspire: ok let me see
06:49  icek: it kind of worked Vorspire, it just made the black peel disappear and the accordion lost its green tabs
06:49  Vorspire: you only want to expand the img?
06:49  icek: if you hover your mouse over there the accordion kinda moves
06:50 --- Killswitch_ is now known as Killswitch
06:50  icek: i put an accordion in that and i want evertyhing to expand except the accordion i just want that to move
06:51  schone: hi all, does jquery have any functions which help with working out the size and length of a multi-dimensional json array ?
06:52  icek: if you look at the animation i want to expand everything except the vid_expand and vid_shrink animations
06:52  icek: i just want those to move that div tag
06:52  icek: and not expand it
06:52  icek: Vorspire
06:53  Vorspire: (icek): i'm here
06:53  Vorspire: just checking it
06:53  icek: the accordion is kinda screwed up a little
06:53  icek: it worked thou
06:53  icek: when i tested it
06:56  Vorspire: hmm
06:56  Vorspire: possibly it messes up because of the jq-ui stuff
06:58  icek: hey vorspire i moved the accordion outside of the animation stuff... can you tell me why when you hover over it it expands sooooo far?
07:01  Vorspire: (icek): seems fine to me
07:01  icek: vorspire, it expands like to two lines!
07:02  Vorspire: what browser?
07:02  icek: chrome, firefox
07:02  icek: mac and windows xp
07:03  antaranian: hey ladies
07:03  icek: Vorspire, do you know a better way to do horizontal accordions than how i am doing it

07:07  icek: lemmie try
07:08  Vorspire: it's a re-write of query.animation.js
07:08  Vorspire: but i'm not sure if it will fix your problems
07:08  Vorspire: whoa it's 6am lol
07:09  icek: where you from
07:09  Vorspire: England
07:10  icek: that broke all the animation
07:10  icek: now it wont even work
07:10  icek: :D
07:10  icek: check to make sure i uploaded it right
07:10  Vorspire: xD
07:11  achew22: I have a js file I am including in my html (http://pastebin.com/37XZax9s) I included an alert inside the (function($){ part to make sure it was getting called (it is) but I can't get to the function with "$.hello()" I can get to it with "$.fn.hello()" is there something I'm missing?
07:12  Vorspire: (icek): ypu still have all the old code in that js file
07:12  Vorspire: you'll have to replace the content completely with that pastebin stuff
07:12  icek: so
07:12  icek: OH
07:12  icek: really
07:13  Vorspire: just make a backup first :P
07:13  icek: ya
07:13  icek: :D
07:14  Vorspire: getting sleepy now, guess i'll finish that nodeMenu plugin later xD
07:14  icek: hmm
07:14  icek: it keeps getting a syntax error of });
07:15  icek: the last line
07:15  achew22: is .fn in plugins only for when you call $('selection')?
07:17  Vorspire: (icek): ahh, this code: 490, shrink()); });
07:17  Vorspire: remove the });
07:17  Vorspire: on the end
07:17  Vorspire: i think that should do it
07:17  Vorspire: no wait

07:34  ruby_on_tails: ok the li need height and width
07:34  ruby_on_tails: and that's crazy
07:34  vladikoff: ruby_on_tails, i suggest you put the demo jcarousel on your site, make sure it works properly and then start hackin on it
07:34  ruby_on_tails: vladikoff: how would I do that ? iam unable even to see it working in any way
07:35  vladikoff: ruby_on_tails, the demo on the jcarousel site or the zip file comes with a few demos
07:35  ruby_on_tails: I can't specifiy width to each LI
07:35  ruby_on_tails: hmm
07:35  coldhead: then you can't use this plugin :(
07:35  coldhead: ul.carousel li {width:30px;height:30px;}
07:35  coldhead: you can't do that?
07:36  ruby_on_tails: all images are of different width

07:45  Cork: motaka2: you don't
07:46  Cork: motaka2: you create an img tag and add it to that or as css to an element
07:46  motaka2: Cork but for my photo gallery I need it to be loaded one by one
07:47  Cork: motaka2: you mean replace the old?
07:47  Cork: or what?
07:47  motaka2: Cork I will have some place holders and then i as they come from the server i will show the thumbs
07:48  Cork: motaka2: ok?
07:48  arex\: Hey, does this JS app spec make any sense what so ever? http://www.scribd.com/full/39573220?access_key=key-yzqt15u6cdg9tnqnb7c
07:48  motaka2: Cork thats all just imagin a photo gallery
07:48  Cork: just do $(placeholder).append($('<img/>').attr('src', url);
07:49  Cork: or if you want to switch image do $('.placeholder img').attr('src', newUrl);
07:50  rmurphey: you can also watch for the load event of each image before loading the next one?
07:51  Cork: sure if you care for them to not start to load the next untill the prev is done

08:29  jMyles: SlexAxton: Checking it out.
08:30  jMyles: SlexAxton: So I put that in firebug's console, and I get nothing.  What am I supposed to see?  Is there no way to inspect an element and see all its bindings?
08:31  SlexAxton: did you switch out the selector with a real one?
08:32  jMyles: SlexAxton: Yes.  :-)

08:35  SlexAxton: $('adsf').data()
08:37  icek: .
08:39  icek: Did someone answer my horizontal accordion question?
08:39  jMyles: SlexAxton: It returns "Object { fxqueue=}"
08:39  icek: thats a horizontal accordion?
08:39  SlexAxton: no
08:40  SlexAxton: jMyles: that's the only element in that object?
08:40  SlexAxton: fxqueue
08:41  SlexAxton: ?eval $('<div />').click(function(){ alert('fart'); }).data('events');
08:41  bot-t: SlexAxton: {"click": [{"handler": function () {alert("fart");}, "data": undefined, "namespace": "", "type": "click", "guid": 1}]}
08:41  jMyles: SlexAxton: The element in question is the one to which the events are bound.  Is that what you're asking?
08:41  SlexAxton: see that?
08:41  SlexAxton: if i bind an event to an object
08:41  jMyles: mm hmm
08:41  SlexAxton: it's event is in the events object on the data of that object
08:41  SlexAxton: if it's not there
08:41  SlexAxton: you're doing something else wrong
08:43  jMyles: ok
08:45  jMyles: SlexAxton: I'm sure I am.  It's not immediately obvious to me, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.  Thanks for the tip.  Do you have any opinion on FireQuery or EventBug or, for that matter, FireBug?
08:46  SlexAxton: those are great for firefox for sure
08:46  SlexAxton: chrome has great dev tools
08:46  SlexAxton: chromium nightly has better ones than that still
08:49  jMyles: SlexAxton: And is there anything in the chrom(ium) dev kit, which I have looked at but not dove into, that allows me to directly inspect an element and then click over to view the event bindings for that element?

08:52  SlexAxton: click on an element
08:52  SlexAxton: then scroll down in the right hand side

08:59  jMyles: SlexAxton: This is interesting.  I am very surprised that Firebug doesn't have this basic functionality.  However, at least in my case, when I look at the "event listeners" in chromium, I see only references to jquery.js, not the actual script that binds the event to the element.
09:00  iszak: jMyles, there's a bookmarklet that shows bound events called visual query.
09:00  SlexAxton: firequery should have that functionality
09:01  SlexAxton: ah, yea visual query is good too
09:01  SlexAxton: i dont do a lot of debugging this way
09:01  SlexAxton: so i might not be the best resource

09:02  jMyles: Thanks again for the help
09:06  jMyles: So, I think I can get down with the idea (and I have already been practicing for a long time) of process code being separated from design, thus we don't use onclick inside a tag anymore.  However, if we have lost the ability to look at an element and see why it behaves the way it does, this seems like a pretty shite trade.  I'm really surprised that there seems to be no way for me to inspect an element and see what will happen if, for exa
09:06  jMyles: mple, I click on it.

09:21  Cork: azuu: you prevent the http submit, but doesn't check if it was caused by an enter, so it will still call the ajax

09:25  Cork: danheberden: i never said to put it on the form
09:25  Cork: ever
09:25  trumpetmic: anyone: who is the fastest/smartest javascript programmer you know, who is available for new projects?
09:25  danheberden: So you're gonna bind an event to every form input? Instead of using propagation to differentiate between them?
09:25  motaka2: Cork help me
09:26  Cork: danheberden: thre alreadi is an event on every element (its checkes for enter)
09:26  Cork: it just have to prevent propagation too
09:26  danheberden: I... Give up, lol
09:27  Cork: motaka2: is that not working for you?
09:27  motaka2: Cork no
09:28  Cork: motaka2: and you have id="button" on the element you click on?
09:28  motaka2: Cork yes, I do
09:28  Cork: motaka2: is the button added statically or inserted through ajax?
09:29  motaka2: it add to the html code
09:29  Cork: hmm
09:29  motaka2: Cork  <input type="button" id="#button" value="load"/>
09:29  Cork: ah
09:29  Cork: no its id="button" not #button
09:29  Cork: # means id
09:30  motaka2: Cork I am stupid . Thank you
09:30  Cork: you would have to do ##button if you do it like that :)
09:30  motaka2: Cork yeah. Thank you
09:42  motaka2: Cork do u know php ?
09:42  PERECil: le prends.
09:44  Cork: motaka2: sure
09:45  motaka2: I think i can use file_get_contents to echo an image to the success function of $.post
09:45  motaka2: ?
09:47  motaka2: Cork before that, is this right ?  $('#display').html('<img src="'+data.image+'"/>');
09:49  Cork: motaka2: if image is an url sure
09:49  Cork: if it isn't no its not correct
09:50  motaka2: Cork yes it is a url
09:50  motaka2: Cork u r busy?
09:50  Cork: motaka2: i'm at work so it goes a bit slow ya
09:51  motaka2: Cork yeah i undeerstand. Thanks for helping me
09:51  Cork: $('#display').html('') will replace everything in #display though
09:51  Cork: motaka2: its actually simpler an faster to add an img tag to the code
09:52  Cork: and just change the src of that element, instead of parsing a new strip of html for every time you want to change image
09:54  motaka2: Cork it must be replaced after the ajax loader image
09:54  Cork: motaka2: what do you mean?
09:55  motaka2: in #display , i show the loader gif when the till i fill it with the image
09:56  motaka2: cork forget about that. Can i use file_get_content in src of that ajax loaded image ?
09:56  Cork: motaka2: no
09:56  Cork: thats php, you need to have an url that you add in js
09:56  motaka2: Cork what should I do then ?
09:56  Cork: publicate an url for your image, and load it in the img tag
09:57  Cork: just an url
09:57  Cork: thats all you need
09:57  Cork: if you want to have security you can stream it through a php script
09:57  Cork: but that will be a bit slow on the server side
09:57  lavr-ik: using animate({top: [500, 'easeOutBounce']}), how can i manage the direction?
09:58  motaka2: Cork I wanna stream it
09:58  Cork: motaka2: but you HAVE to have an url for the img tag, you can't send data to the ajax
09:58  Cork: motaka2: you can't
09:58  Cork: motaka2: well you can straem it, but you have noway to use it in js
09:58  Cork: *stream
09:58  Titosemi: hey guys, i am using a plugin for all the notifications on the page. I call it like $.notify(msg); Now i am trying to call the notification as a callback from the form validation plugin but it says that $.notify() is not a function. What am i missing?
09:58  Cork: motaka2: it will just be useless text
09:58  lavr-ik: i want tyo make it inertial
09:59  motaka2: cork let me run a test , I remeber I have added i have used file get contents in src
10:00  sean`: ?empty @ cork
10:00  bot-t: cork, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/

10:03  lavr-ik: using animate({top: [500, 'easeOutBounce']}), how can i manage the direction? i want it to be inertial
10:04  motaka2: Cork you are right . it is impossible
10:04  Cork: motaka2: js has no way to handle binary data, thats why you use urls everywhere instead
10:05  motaka2: Cork yes that's right
10:05  Cork: sean`: this is what isn't happending with jquery-ui elements "To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from the child elements before removing the elements themselves."
10:06  Cork: sean`: the jquery-ui .destroy() call never happens on elements inside the element you run .empty() on
10:06  sean`: Cork, ?
10:06  motaka2: so cork what do you think is the best soloution for making a photo gallery? I want this photo gallery to load images one by one. so the user wont need to wait for all the photos to be loaded
10:07  Cork: motaka2: i would have an #display img tag, where i show the throbber image when the page starts
10:07  Cork: motaka2: i would then through a json call grab all the images thumbs
10:08  Cork: motaka2: then i would loop over them and add the thumbs to the page in a container $('#thumbs').append($('<img/>').attr('src', url);
10:09  Cork: motaka2: i would have a live listner on the thumbs that when i click it it would change the url of the #display img to the new url
10:09  Titosemi: any help for me ? :)
10:10  Cork: Titosemi: have you created notify as a plugin for jquery or something?
10:11  Titosemi: Cork: yes, it´s a plugin
10:11  motaka2: Cork thats good. Thank you. Look I want each thumb to load with it's larg image
10:12  Cork: motaka2: i would prob use thumbs, and have a background loop preload the big images async
10:12  Cork: motaka2: that way it would load faster
10:12  motaka2: Cork that means i dont want the thumb to be show before the big image is tranfered from server
10:13  Titosemi: It´s the Impromptu plugin. I run it like $.prompt rather than $.notify :)
10:13  Cork: motaka2: ok so use a preload loop, and use the load event on them to trigger the next load when the image is loaded
10:14  Cork: Titosemi: are you sure $ is jquery in the callback=
10:14  Cork: *?
10:16  Titosemi: Cork: no. How can i check/assign it?
10:16  Cork: Titosemi: your using noConflict?
10:16  motaka2: crok the way i want to make my gallery is proper or do u think i should first create all thumb versions using php gd and then request for them ?
10:16  Titosemi: Cork no
10:17  Cork: Titosemi: is $ assigned at all?
10:17  Cork: motaka2: it depends on how you want to show the interface
10:18  trumpetmic: Looking for an incredible web developer to add to the team, immediately. Send inquiries to mike@caskeymedia.com,  pt, ft, and contract
10:18  Cork: motaka2: if your ok with a longer loading time before all images is loaded, then its less data to send to send the full size
10:18  motaka2: Cork the first way wont impose loads on cpu
10:18  Titosemi: Cork: It wasnt, but now it is
10:19  Cork: motaka2: it might impose it in a round about way, as you will send much more data
10:19  motaka2: Cork thank you very much.
10:19  Titosemi: I´ve made a quick function to test it, so the call to the $.prompt it´s inside the function
10:19  Cork: Titosemi: thats weird, either your doing something that replaces it, or you trigger before jquery has loaded
10:19  CptPicard: anyone here been using jstree...? if I have ajax html_data tree, what sort of html should I return for a node with no children?
10:19  Titosemi: and i create a button to test it
10:19  Titosemi: $("#wrapper").append('<a class="test" onclick="show(\'Yuhu\');">test</a>');
10:20  doonie: JKarsrud mind pm?
10:20  JKarsrud: doonie: Preferably not, but sure :)
10:20  Cork: Titosemi: you add a link to test if jquery exist??
10:20  Cork: why??
10:21  Titosemi: Cork because if i just run $.prompt, it´s works
10:21  Titosemi: if i try to run it inside a function, it fails
10:21  Cork: Titosemi: its something wrong with your code
10:22  Cork: Titosemi: could you pastebin it or is it to big?

10:22  Titosemi: no, it´s not. i´m going to post it
10:22  Cork: lavr-ik: it moves from the start position, to the new position
10:22  lavr-ik: yeah, but can i manage the direction of its moving?
10:22  Cork: lavr-ik: so grab the current position and calculate your offset
10:23  Cork: lavr-ik: you mean how it bounces?

10:31  Cork: CGo: you want it to fade or slide?
10:31  CGo: .animate({'css-setting':'value','css-setting':'value'}).css('display','none'); doesn't appear to work either.
10:31  Titosemi: Cork:  but that´s it´s just a test. My real problem it´s the call to $.prompt inside the invalidHandler form the $-validator.SetDefaults. It says that $.prompt it´s not a function
10:32  CGo: Cork, slide. I'm just trying to get it to hide the element after the animation.

10:34  victorho: Hi! I am trying to make a new window open when a user submits a form. However, it keeps opening as a popup (I want it to open as a new tab, so it doesn't get blocked by the popup blocker). I have tried both target="_blank" and window.open(). What am I doing wrong?
10:34  CGo: And yeah I know, but the slideDown/slideUp have a fixed orientation.
10:34  CGo: I want it to slide into view *upward*.
10:34  Cork: victorho: its the settings of your browser
10:34  Cork: victorho: there is only .open and _blank, but you have to do it in an event where the user clicks
10:35  Cork: victorho: else the blocker will catch it
10:35  victorho: hmm I see
10:35  victorho: I wonder what I am doing wrong
10:35  Zarathu: Perhaps I should clarify. I'm using the gRaphael plugin and the code is calling .rect() to create a rectangle. But I want there to be a bounce effect on hover(); how can I implement this?
10:35  victorho: Cork: right now it is already part of an onclick event though
10:36  victorho: Cork: when the user hits the "submit" button, calls a function that says "form.submit"
10:36  Zarathu: Specifically, on the hover for that particular rectangle.
10:36  victorho: Cork and the form has target="_blank"
10:36  Cork: victorho: you would have to use a submit button inside the form
10:36  victorho: Cork: confusing because I am copying the way another site does it, and theirs opens in a new tab fine in my browser
10:37  victorho: Cork: ok so I need to have a physical submit button INSIDE the form
10:37  Cork: victorho: you have to trigger the open new window from the user action
10:37  Cork: you can't go through own generated events
10:37  Cork: cause if you do you will be blocked
10:37  victorho: Cork: great, thanks!!
10:38  Cork: Zarathu: you would have to fiddle with .animate
10:38  Cork: Zarathu: and its effects
10:39  Zarathu: Cork: Yeah. But I want to know where, specifically, I should pass the function into hover().
10:39  Zarathu: I'm toying with rect.node.hover = function() { ... }
10:39  Zarathu: That doesn't seem to be working, though.
10:39  Cork: Zarathu: svg is elements in the pages,
10:39  Cork: but you need the dom element not a wrapper object
10:40  Cork: so make sure you get the pure dom element, and you should be able to wrap it in jquery and animate it
10:41  Titosemi: Cork: any more ideas? :)
10:41  Zarathu: Cork: That makes sense. Thanks. :>
10:41  khinester: hello

10:43  Zarathu: If you could, look at that...
10:43  Zarathu: Oh, wait, I need to call it on $(covers[i].node)
10:44  khinester: i have an autocomplete, like http://pastie.org/1229419 how do i bind the selected value and then make another ajax call to pull the associated data based on the selected item?
10:46  ruby_on_tails: how can I increment marginLeft by 1 px continuosly using animate ?
10:46  ruby_on_tails: instead of specifying the end target ?
10:47  Cork: ruby_on_tails: i don't think you can
10:47  ruby_on_tails: hmmk
10:48  Slartibart: Isn't it possible to specify the increment instead of an end target?
10:48  Slartibart: *an
10:50  Cork: Slartibart: you can make it add/remove x px from the starting value
10:50  Cork: but not for indefinitly
10:50  Slartibart: Can't he just call some +1 code in a loop then? setTimeOut() etc?
10:50  Cork: (that is say an offset, but not a step size)
10:51  Cork: Slartibart: ya, that would be the only way

11:41  sean`: j7rft, use the step option
11:42  bryankarlsson: Cork: But the 'value' belongs to the datepicker.
11:43  bryankarlsson: Cork: I want to post the select box in with another variable in load
11:43  sean`: so, no one checked uot my code?
11:43  Cork: bryankarlsson: no the {'value'} is only a wraping for the post call
11:43  krz: sean`: doesnt work

11:46  LearnerJq: if a piece of html is return via $.ajax method to a div within the dom with .html(),so will it be permanently the part of the DOM then?or some appendTo method needs to be used so that the embedded html can also be then traversed by the JQuery object? I am successfully inserting some html into the desired div...but elements within that new html are not being traversed by my code
11:47  Cork: LearnerJq: if you use .html() it means it will replace everything in the parent with the new html
11:47  Cork: LearnerJq: so ya it will be part of the dom untill you remove it
11:48  krz: sean`: http://pastebin.com/KwVuYrRR doesn not work!
11:48  bryankarlsson: Cork: When I echo $_POST['select'], the output is: Array
11:48  LearnerJq: Cork:yes but then anything inside that new html is traversable via JQUERy ?I AM able to traverse the newly embedded html via the console of firebug..but the same code wont work in my document then
11:48  sean`: krz, only jsfiddle
11:48  krz: i get the alert. but the return false, is not executing
11:48  sean`: I'm a one gal only kinda guy
11:49  Cork: bryankarlsson: what was it you put in the select in load?
11:49  Cork: that is, where did you get the data from=
11:49  Cork: *?
11:49  bryankarlsson: Cork: {'value': datum, 'select': jQuery('.closed_times').val()}
11:50  Cork: bryankarlsson: is closed_times alone on the page?
11:50  Cork: that is are you only using it on a single element?
11:50  Cork: wait that shouldn't matter...
11:51  bryankarlsson: Cork: What do you mean with "alone"? Alone as, if it is only one form or whatever with the name "closed_times"?
11:52 --- Titosemi_ is now known as Titosemi
11:52  Cork: bryankarlsson: try jQuery('.closed_times').eq(0).val()
11:53  Cork: bryankarlsson: i meant if you have more then one element in the page with the class "closed_times"
11:57  bryankarlsson: Cork: That doesn't work. No, I only have only one element with closed_times
11:57  Dykam: oh wow, the value attribute of form elements really is a weird thing :/
11:57  Cork: bryankarlsson: try an var_dump($_POST['select'])
11:57  Dykam: like... it doesn't appear in chrome inspector, and css doesn't work with it
11:57  Cork: what?
11:58  Cork: sure it does
11:58  Dykam: but... when setting it manually in the inspector, it works for css, but that is not reflected in the page nor javascript
11:58  Dykam: $("input").attr("value") // still the visible page value, not the attribute `value` value
11:58  Dykam: horrible :/
11:59  Cork: Dykam: that goes on the attribute value
11:59  Cork: use .val instead
11:59  Dykam: ehm
11:59  Dykam: .val and attr value are both the same
11:59  Dykam: that is, give the same result
11:59  bryankarlsson: Cork: the var_dump($_POST) results NULL
12:00  Dykam: oh, it works when the form is empty beforehand :/
12:00  bryankarlsson: var_dump($_POST['
12:00  Cork: oh wait
12:00  Cork: your using post
12:00  bryankarlsson: Yes
12:00  Cork: i think load use get
12:00  Cork: so try $_GET
12:00  Dykam: but then changing it via the page disconnects the two `value` attributes
12:00  bryankarlsson: What should I do? :P
12:00  Cork: bryankarlsson: var_dump($_GET['select'])
12:01  bryankarlsson: It results NULL
12:01  Cork: ...
12:01  bryankarlsson: Wierd.

I'm using jQuery to read from a file and place the string into a variable that I will later output to html, but the string contains alphanumeric character, now what I need is to somehow fiter that string in the variable to output only digits to html. is there a simple way to do that?
12:18  pLr: zkn3: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/regex
12:18  SeivanH: zkn3: as a hack, loop over the string, regex, and sort them in two different arrays.
12:19  zkn3: ok i shall take a look at regex plugin
12:20  zkn3: though i dont need to sort really, just filter out digits from the string in the order they appear

12:34  krz: sean`: well $('#comments ul').find('a[data-remote]') gives me all the a elements
12:35  krz: or am i doing it the other way around?
12:35  sean`: yup
12:36  sean`: $('#comments').find ('ul a[data-remote][href^=foo/bar/]')

12:38  coldhead: zfmf: can you link to the demo you are using so someone else can test it?
12:38  Kasper^: is it possible to access elements loaded via ajax using jQuery ? e.g. $("#myel").val()...
12:38  sean`: krz, var $a =  $('#comments').find ('ul a[data-remote][href^=/songs/1/comments/]');
12:38  sean`: $a.filter ('[href$=123]');
12:39  Kasper^: can jQuery access elements loaded via ajax ?
12:39  krz: hm
12:40  sean`: Kasper^, yes
12:40  sean`: even when they're not added to the dom
12:41  krz: sean`: wow elegant solution
12:41  krz: thanks for that
12:41  coldhead: sean`++ is very good <3
12:42  krz: $('#comments').find ('ul a[data-remote]').filter('[href$=290]'); seems to work as well
12:42  thiago_: the .load() function don't work with absolute callbacks path?
12:42  sean`: krz, yes, that's perfect as well
12:42  sean`: faster even.. but it makes no sense ot do taht
12:42  sean`: if you're not gonna store your orignal result
12:42  sean`: $('#comments').find ('ul a[data-remote][href$=290]'); will work also
12:43  coldhead: thiago_: can you show us your code? i don't know what you mean
12:43  Kasper^: sean` how? $("#myel") cannot see the element
12:44  sean`: Kasper^, ?
12:44  krz: $('#comments').find ('ul a[data-remote][href$=/comments/290]').parents('li').fadeOut() seems to do it

13:36  Zelest: if I run jQuery code on a page which is fetched via an ajax, do I need to load the jQuery script on that page as well? Or will it use the already loaded jQuery code from the "parent" page?
13:36  Jarda: mongag: should work
13:36  Cork: Zelest: when you load a page; do you mean iframe?
13:36  Cork: or what?
13:36  Zelest: $.ajax()
13:36  Jarda: mongag: http://jsfiddle.net/Ts7mg/1/
13:36  Cork: Zelest: ya, but in what kind of element
13:37  Cork: you put it in a div, a span or what?
13:37  Zelest: e.g, a div
13:37  Cork: Zelest: then its part of the current page, and you don't need to add anything
13:37  mongag: hm.. strange
13:37  Cork: Zelest: you souldn't have a complete page though
13:37  nail_: Is there a handy way to have access to a css rule attributes? e.g. if I have a rule ".ambiance.blue { color: #0000ff; }" defined in my stylesheet I'd like to get the value of the color attribute, *but* without having any dom element with that class. The only way I found was looping over all document.styleSheets until found
13:38  Zelest: yeah
13:38  Zelest: hmms
13:38  Cork: Zelest: only part of it. that is, no header, html tag or body tag
13:38  Zelest: yeah :)
13:39  Cork: Zelest: it really only gives you some text to add to the current page, so it isn't a "new page", its just text added to the current page :)
13:40  Zelest: argh...
13:40  Zelest: this seriously starts to piss me off

15:49  JoelE: Hey! Is there anyway to trigger a handler only when the mouse enters a DIV  (just one time once it enters the element), and not ALL the time, like HOVER does?
15:49  Hierofant: Bertrand - Yes?  I don't know what you even mean.  When I hit f12, like I said, it makes a blank icon on my taskbar.
15:50  chrisq: is there an easy way to add a "confirm send" dialog to ajax-calls which decides if the ajax is sent or not, based on the user input to the dialog?

15:52  Hex_101: OH
15:52  Hex_101: idk,
15:52  Bertrand: Hierofant: if you restarted your pc, and opened IE with about:Tabs, would you be able to get Dev Tools then?
15:52  JoelE: any ideas?

15:54  chrisq: wwd: use live()
15:54  chrisq: wwd: oops
15:54  chrisq: answered before finishing reading what you wrote, sorry

15:54  JoelE: thnx

16:02  chrisq: dr0id: is the form fetched using "load" or similar?
16:02  dr0id: umm, no

16:05  dr0id: chrisq: any idea?

16:07  level09: it explains it all
16:07  level09: :DD
16:07  chrisq: ah, i thought by setting the ajax datatype to json it would automagically create an object which could be used
16:11  chrisq: dr0id: maybe you need to return false there?
16:11  dr0id: tried returning true
16:11  dr0id: let me try false now heh
16:11  ambackstrom: chrisq: it does, the "data" argument to the callback is an object (well, anything that can be represented by json)

16:24  jMyles: I want to be able to inspect an element (presumably in firebug, but I'm very open to other similar solutions) and see what events are bound to it.

16:37  timing: haha there is a grid called: Ingrid. I wonder if there is one called Henk as well
16:40  timing: monk12: I think google chrome will indeed show it tried to download it twice, but I think it fetches it from cache

16:43  ff0000_it: or should i put the check outside $.ajax()?
16:44  monk12: timing: cool ... was curious theoretically what would happen and that sounds interesting. FF and IE would do same or not sure?

19:24  codemonkey701: Bertrand: haha its hard to describe. once i leave the li and go to the subnav it starts animating so i was thinking i need to use hoverint

19:55  Hierofant: reeeky apparently so
19:55  Hierofant: I'll just put his pimply retarded ass on ignore
19:57  khinester: why do i get a syntax error at (.each(json.val), function(name, value) {...
19:57  khinester: http://pastie.org/1230307
19:57  Bertrand_afk: pareantheis after val
19:58  Cork[home]: khinester: uhh. caue you can't put .each inside the attribute paranteses
19:58  Cork[home]: *cause
19:58  trumpetmic: thanks Bertrand_afk
19:58  Cork[home]: khinester: i think what you want is $.each(json.val, function()
19:59  sunfun: does anybody know why $("#"+var) doesn't work in ie with compatibility mode enabled?
20:00  Cork[home]: sunfun: why would you run ie8 in compatibility mode when you create a webpage??
20:01  Jonz: cork: to test how it looks in IE7?
20:01 --- jalama|afk is now known as jalama
20:01  sunfun: Cork[home]: it is not for me... it's because the page i'm writing is in a context of legacy software
20:01  Cork[home]: Jonz: ie8+compatibility mode != ie7
20:02  Jonz: ie8+compatibility mode ~= ie7
20:02  Cork[home]: no
20:02  sunfun: Cork[home]: and the man who uses this page has alway the compatibility mode on
20:02  Cork[home]: you will still render with the ie8 rendering agent
20:02  Cork[home]: and it doesn't have all the bugs ie7 has
20:03  Vorspire: IE should be phased out :P
20:03  Jonz: in my experience it's a pretty good heuristic
20:03  Cork[home]: compatibility mode just means it tries not to break old pages
20:03  Cork[home]: not that it try to emulate all of < ie8
20:04  Cork[home]: Jonz: i know alot of situations that it fails
20:04  Vorspire: it's like programming a .net 2.0 app using .net 4.0 as the base lol

20:06  Cork[home]: you closing the attribute parantes to early
20:06  Cork[home]: i said
20:06  Cork[home]: khinester: i think what you want is $.each(json.val, function()

20:27  zkn: Hi, can someone help me implement regex plugin in my code? i cannot get past the syntax error i'm getting..
20:27  zkn: it's a few lines of code
20:28  zkn: and i want to use regex to strip out digits from my string stored in a varaible
20:29  snover: uh…plugin?
20:30  zkn: yes, i was sugested to use regex plugin here earlier but my dumb brain does not know how to make it work
20:32  swiggy: how do i match regex with jquery?
20:32  SugaSlide: normal js
20:33  swiggy: bah
20:33  zkn: http://www.examplet.buss.hk/jquery/selector.regex.php
20:34  snover: zkn: Um, I am pretty someone told you to use *a RegExp*, not a regular expression selector plugin for jQuery.
20:34  snover: zkn: jQuery is not a replacement for JavaScript.
20:34  krz: whats wrong with this: $('#interaction_tabs ul li:eq(0)').prepend(<a href="/songs/1/likes/555" data-method="delete" data-remote="true" rel="nofollow">Unlove</a>)
20:35  zkn: :regex and regex()
20:35  snover: krz: you have no quotation marks around your string???
20:35  msj: my content area is 380px long, is there a way to scroll through the content in this area using the global scrolling bar
20:35  defendguin: how do i modify how an item in my autocomplete is rendered?  I want to customize it and I really don't understand the example here http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
20:35  krz: thanks
20:37  defendguin: i would have thought there would have been a way to access this inside of the "open" event but i haven't found it yet
20:37  sneakyness: hey snover what do you use when it comes to skinning drop downs/checkboxen/forms?
20:40  zkn: $.get("test.txt", function(number){if (number.length>0) {$('#display').html("number is <b>"+number+"</b>"); } else { $('#display').html("no number");}});
20:40  sanguisleft: how can I Print (append) the dom id of an opject
20:40  zkn: so first i read the contents of a file and store the string in a variable
20:41  timing: $('body').append($('#element').attr('id'));
20:42  zkn: but I need to filter that string and strip only digits from it before I output the info to html
20:42  hemanth: how do i get the selected value from the autocomplete() ?
20:43  zkn: the string would contain alphanumeric data but i want to allow only digits reach htlm
20:43  ^Lestat: zkn: str.replace(/[^0-9.-]/g, "")
20:43  timing: zkn: can you paste an example of one of those strings?
20:43  timing: a well Lestat has it :-)
20:43  n_time: is there a qunit room, byt any chance?
20:43  n_time: ne1?
20:44  hobs: no but there is certainly a gunit room
20:44  timing: queue nit wit?
20:44  n_time: oh jeez, hobs. that is superduper what i need.
20:45  zkn: sure... example string:   ${UK}/+35138947563
20:45  n_time: anyone here all 1337 like at qunit?
20:45  timing: zkn: ah you could also split on the / and have the UK part too
20:45  hobs: lol
20:45  n_time: looking for some pro tiiiips.
20:45  zkn: i need only the numbers
20:46  n_time: hobs, you any good at dem qunits?
20:46  zkn: the rest is irrelevant for web
20:46  timing: zkn: okay then do what lestat said
20:46  timing: it will strip the + too
20:47  zkn: so where should i put str.replace(/[^0-9.-]/g, "")  ?   i have tried similar sugestions, which either don't do anything or break everything
20:47  timing: what is the error?
20:47  zkn: syntax error
20:47  zkn: :)
20:47  timing: hehe
20:47  timing: paste your code at jsfiddle
20:48  msj: is there a way to scroll the contents of an area using the main scrolling bar
20:48  timing: msj: use a fixed div for the content you want to keep at the same place
20:48  zkn: sorry, jsfiddle?
20:49  timing: http://jsfiddle.net
20:49  timing: it's in the /topic
20:49  msj: i'll try that
20:50  zkn: hmm...this looks interesting..
20:50  khinester: why does line 24 works, but line 25 does not, the .ajax get returns the output on line 37
20:50  khinester: http://pastie.org/1230307
20:51  msj: timing - maybe i don't know what im doing - but is not working
20:51  zkn: the code i pasted here, too
20:51  zkn: $.get("test.txt", function(number){if (number.length>0) {$('#display').html("number is <b>"+number+"</b>"); } else { $('#display').html("no number");}});
20:51  sneakyness: dear jquery, I love you for always being that freelance work I can fall back on when everything else falls through
20:53  codemonkey701: is there a way to fade something out then remove it seems liek fadeOut().remove() removes it right away
20:54  codemonkey701: hmm maybe i can do a call back
20:54  Jonz: codemonkey701 the last parameter for fadeOut is a callback
20:54  Jonz: yeah do that
20:55  timing: zkn: yeah just your replace in it ?
20:56  codemonkey701: Jonz: thanks
20:56  msj: can someone plz look at this http://jsfiddle.net/kCL9R/
20:56  Jonz: hehe, you answered it yourself faster
20:56  msj: im not sure if this is posible
20:57  zkn: timing?
20:57  timing: zkn: ?
20:57  zkn: :)
20:57  zkn: how do you mean?
20:58  zkn: replace in it..
20:58  annon: I have an object with a method that calls $.getJSON. In the getJSON callback method, I want to access the object that owns the method. What's the best way?
20:58  timing: zkn: add the replace call in that function
20:58  timing: otherwise I don't know what you are dojng :-)
21:00  hemanth: how do i get the selected value from the autocomplete() ?
21:00  zkn: ok, let me ask this way: how would I filter my variable "number" with str.replace(/[^0-9.-]/g, "") so when I call out 'number' again, it will display digits only?
21:00  timing: zkn: dude
21:00  timing: http://jsfiddle.net/t8EtS/

21:02  ajavid: thing is this though
21:03  ajavid: search.php returns 1 string, which is a http://blah.com/link/to/image.ext
21:03  n_time: ajavid: is it on the same domain as your site?
21:03  ajavid: THAT is what I need
21:03  ajavid: no
21:03  ajavid: http://pastie.org/1230570
21:03  zkn: so that's how it's done
21:03  timing: zkn: yeah
21:03  ajavid: http://facebook.frostedweb.com/ilikeitonthe/search.php?keyword=linux
21:03  timing: hey gotto go!
21:03  ajavid: see on the script it self
21:04  ajavid: i get an image, its fine
21:04  ajavid: everything is cool so far
21:04  zkn: i need to let is sink in a bit :)
21:04  ajavid: so far so good yeah
21:04  timing: ajavid: run it through a http proxy on your own server
21:04  zkn: but thanks a bunch
21:04  ajavid: I don't get it
21:04  ajavid: what do you mean?
21:04  timing: google!
21:04  ajavid: thats it?

21:05  bartzy: What's the difference between the events 'load' and 'readystatechange' when bound to an image ?
21:05  n_time: ajavid use easyxdm
21:05  n_time: : D
21:05  steveoh_afk: on the jqgrid row editing example "using events"  there is a onselectrow event that enables editing on that row.  however you can't restore it's state without clicking on another row.  do I need a ui button to cancel that or could i connect to a blur event or something?
21:05 --- steveoh_afk is now known as steveoh
21:05  ajavid: how about this
21:05  ajavid: hmm
21:05  ajavid: i could global image
21:06  ajavid: and then referece $image as php
21:06  snover: easyxdm only works if both sites implement it, n_time
21:06  ajavid: wow, such a simple solution
21:06  ajavid: hah
21:06  timing: yeah or just skip the whole js :-)
21:06  n_time: sure, ajavid
21:06  ajavid: well
21:07  ajavid: hm, might not work... or it might actually multiple php files and nto the same request
21:07  ajavid: global won't work.
21:07  ajavid: but..
21:07  ajavid: I could write the contents of that search.php (which is jsut one line) into a text file
21:07  bartzy: What's the difference between the events 'load' and 'readystatechange' when bound to an image ?
21:07  ajavid: then in the other php script, I can load th text file as a string and use the http link
21:07  ajavid: voila
21:07  ajavid: i think that should work.
21:07  ajavid: its probably faster than cross domian
21:07  ajavid: or proxy stuff

21:16  Phrogz: Those of you using JS-enabled copy-to-clipboard: what are you using these days?
21:16  bartzy: Cork[home] so for that readystatechange is used ?
21:17  bartzy: Cork[home]: And 'load' works for images in all browsers ?

21:17  Cork[home]: *function(){});
21:18  Cork[home]: bartzy: .load is onload, and it triggers when the content is loaded
21:18  bartzy: Cork[home], oh... so it's the standard way to check if an <img> was loaded right ?
21:18  Cork[home]: bartzy: .load is yes
21:18  Cork[home]: and iframes
21:18  Cork[home]: and... so on
21:19  Cork[home]: bartzy: redystatechange is that the dom is ready and stable to modify through js
21:19  Cork[home]: same as the jquery alternatives, but readystatechagne isn't supported in ie
21:20  Cork[home]: thats why the jquery wrapper is there

21:31  mattmtl: thisoneguy2010: thanks
21:31  thisoneguy2010: canvas you write once and the information is destroyed, I believe.  you have to keep track of stuff yourself

21:31  thisoneguy2010: er mattmtl I mean

21:37  bartzy: Can I listen on 'load' on a img element that is not in the DOM ?
21:38  bartzy: meaning $('<img>').bind('load'.......... ?
21:38  Cork[home]: bartzy: i think so
21:38  bartzy: and it will actually load in the background ?
21:38  Cork[home]: bartzy: but i can't garantee it, give it a try ;)
21:39  bartzy: just doing $('<img src="whatever.jpg"') will preload whatever.jpg ?

21:39  thisoneguy2010: you can't do that
21:40  thisoneguy2010: keep an array of your shapes

21:43  ajpiano: you do foo.bind("contextmenu",function(e) { }) and you can get the event coords from the click etc
21:43  ajpiano: boom
21:44  ManxPower: I managed to hover rows and zebra rows with a tutorial

21:44  Cork[home]: there is one catch to think about though, contextmenu triggers after mouseup in windows but BEFORE in linux (not sure about mac)
21:44  ManxPower: ajavid, I assume "e" is a variable containing the event.  What would I do with the coordinates returned?
21:44  jedimind: you know you dont need javascript to do zebra rows
21:44  ajpiano: ManxPower, probably position a div at that location??
21:44  ManxPower: ajpiano, never done that before.  I'll look into it.
21:45  ManxPower: I am a total n00b when it comes to this stuff.
21:45  Cork[home]: ManxPower: just absolute position or fixed position the div
21:45  ManxPower: you can see why I will look for a tutorial

21:48  ManxPower: Cork, I think the easiest thing to do is use any contextmenu plugin I can find and stop worrying so much about it being lightweight.
21:48  Cork[home]: ManxPower: its not really something hard to write, but sure
21:48  b1lly: jonz, you mind directing me in the right direction?
21:49  ManxPower: Cork[home], not hard to write for you. 8-)
21:49  WoNHommer: http://pastebin.com/WbVJhBkT <- why does line 6 break the code?
21:49  b1lly: say i wanted the $test php variable to = $(this).attr('value');
21:49  ManxPower: JS is exactly one thing to me.  It is something to help support my PHP code.
21:49  Cork[home]: ManxPower: its farly basic html+css+js functions
21:49  ajpiano: ManxPower, yeah exactly, half the reason it's not as "lightweight" as you probably think it should be is because you have no idea the complexitiies that really go into making a contextmenu that works as well as you want,
21:49  Jonz: b1lly, check out http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/ and php.net
21:49  ajpiano: so when you actually take those things into account
21:49  ajpiano: it adds weight to the code
21:49  Cork[home]: ManxPower: as long as you don't have to get complicated with sub menus and things like that ;)
21:49  ajpiano: but also makes it work.
21:50  thegozt: can anyone help me w the following code using the easing plugin.... $("").animate({ left: "" }, {duration:2000, easing:easeOutElastic});
21:50  zim: Hi all. what is the form validation plugin of the moment? or is it now part of jquery or the ui?
21:51  thisoneguy2010: strange... if I take <!DOCTYPE html>  off the top of the page it works in FF & chrome.  but that causes errors in IE
21:51  thisoneguy2010: can javascript write to the top of the page before its loaded into the browser?
21:51  l4rk: thisoneguy2010: thats not strange at all
21:51  l4rk: you need a doctype
21:51  l4rk: thisoneguy2010: no no no no no no no stop
21:51  l4rk: leave the damn doctype
21:51  thisoneguy2010: but why does removing it make things OK in FF
21:51  l4rk: because you have shitty markup/code atm
21:51  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: you should never remove the doctype
21:51  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: the html5 doctype is to make a minimal doctype declaration that triggers standard mode in browsers
21:52  ManxPower: thisoneguy2010, as I understand it IE uses the doc type to determine if it needs to be in standards or quirks mode.
21:52  zamba: i'm using the validation plugin to validate a form.. is there a way to make sure that a set of inputs are unique?
21:52  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: without it you get querks mode
21:52  Cork[home]: *qurks
21:52  thisoneguy2010: what is the importance of doctype in FF
21:52  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: doctypes are always important
21:52  wib: always use a doctype
21:52  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: you should ask in #html btw
21:52  thisoneguy2010: why does removing it make the page work though
21:53  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: its the same, but its a less buggy browser
21:53  zim: try this one <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
21:53  jjeff: ben_alman: ping
21:53  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: cause your lucky
21:53  Cork[home]: zim: why use xhtml if your going to get converted to html anyway?
21:53  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: you can't predict how it will look without a doctype
21:53  khinester: can someone point me in the right direction with this http://pastie.org/1230307, i can get the var addresses = json.val; to work
21:53  Jonz: this is my favorite doctype <!DOCTYPE html>
21:54  WoNHommer: Anyone on my issue: http://pastebin.com/WbVJhBkT <- line 6 kills my code..
21:54  thisoneguy2010: adding the longer doctype didn't help FF
21:54  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: one thing I learned is that firefox is always right, the others are wrong
21:55  chrisq: is there an easy way to make a user "confirm"(popup/whatever) before sending ajax?
21:55  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: does your code pass the w3 validation?
21:55  ajpiano: thisoneguy2010: you need to go out and do your research
21:55  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: thats a bit over the top
21:55  Cork[home]: :)
21:55  ajpiano: randomly throwing doctypes at your page
21:55  ajpiano: and wondering why they have the effect that they have
21:55  ajpiano: is kind of pointless
21:55  WoNHommer: just use <!DOCTYPE html>
21:55  erichynds: ?mdc confirm @ chrisq
21:55  bot-t: chrisq, window.confirm - Displays a modal dialog with a message and two buttons, OK and Cancel. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.confirm
21:56  thisoneguy2010: now the dialog is even smaller
21:56  Cork[home]: ie is more or less always wrong, but opera, firefox, safari and chrome is the same
21:56  thisoneguy2010: it almost passes WoNHommer
21:56  chrisq: erichynds: thanks, i'll look at that :)
21:56  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: almost for what?
21:56  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: stay with the html5 doctype
21:56  thegozt: can anyone help me w the following code using the easing plugin.... $("").animate({ left: "" }, {duration:2000, easing:easeOutElastic});
21:57  thisoneguy2010: is there something wrong with this? if((jQuery.url.setUrl(url).param("width") > 1) && (jQuery.url.setUrl(url).param("width") > 1)){
21:57  thisoneguy2010: validator seems to not like the && part
21:57  Cork[home]: khinester: do a console output of what you have in json.val, so you know its actually what you expect
21:57  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: validator should never even read js
21:58  thisoneguy2010: it is
21:58  WoNHommer: thisoneguy2010: can't you put this in an external script?
21:58  thisoneguy2010: yeah
21:58  WoNHommer: do it
21:58  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: are you evaluating it as html5 or xhtml?
21:58  thisoneguy2010: fine...
21:59  thisoneguy2010: xhtml now with the doctype
21:59  Cork[home]: use html5
21:59  Cork[home]: your not writing xhtml anyway
21:59  thisoneguy2010: ya that'll work real good in IE
21:59  thisoneguy2010: lol
21:59  Cork[home]: so stay true with what your writing
21:59  thisoneguy2010: ok
21:59  WoNHommer: IE is never a good parameter
21:59  Cork[home]: and did you put the script tag in your body or header?
22:00  WoNHommer: if only IE shows it right, it means your code is wrong
22:00  thisoneguy2010: hehe
22:00  Cork[home]: (that the validator warned about)
22:00  thisoneguy2010: it was in the html doc not in a exteral file.  moving it external now
22:01  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: thats not what i asked
22:01  Cork[home]: thisoneguy2010: did you add the script block in your body or inline up in the header?
22:01  WoNHommer: Cork[home]: is there anything I should know about putting scripts inside the body? I never did that, but in my current project I had no other way...
22:02  Cork[home]: cause if you have the script block in your body, you have to wrap your code in comments to escape from the parser
22:02  sanguisleft: thisoneguy2010: how do I add a shape to an array when I am drwaing it I just cant figure that out
22:02  hemanth: how do i avoid The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
22:02  WoNHommer: but heeeeey! No one can answer my question? http://pastebin.com/WbVJhBkT <- line 6 breaking the code...
22:02  Cork[home]: and if you go by broken xhtml error corrected as html you get even wors >_<'
22:02 --- el_kevino is now known as el_kevino_afk
22:03  thisoneguy2010: sanguisleft, you should be able to follow the code here thats making the animated banner.  http://jerome.newskoolsoftware.com/portfolio
22:03  chrisq: can an ajax() post be cancelled by a function in the beforeSend option?
22:04  thisoneguy2010: oh right
22:04  sanguisleft: thisoneguy2010: will look into it
22:04  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: if you add a script block in the body it should be <script> \n <!--\n ... //--> \n </script>
22:04  thisoneguy2010: js is external now, passes validations
22:05  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: but if its xhtml read as html its...
22:05  thisoneguy2010: but dialog is still to skinny
22:05  Cork[home]: <script> \n <!--//--><![CDATA[//><!--
22:05  Cork[home]: ... \n //--><!]]> \n </script>
22:05  Ankabout: I need to do something, and I'm betting jQuery can do it. Everyone tells me jQuery is the best thing since sliced bread, so let's see
22:05  WoNHommer: Cork[home]: the validator never complained about it, nothing is broken and I didn't do it..
22:06  b1lly: i'm trying to pass a variable from jquery to php, and I'm doing it this way and having trouble http://pastebin.com/a0XZF55f
22:06  thisoneguy2010: so weird that if there isn't a doctype ff renders is right.  does FF put a detault doctype in if you dont put one in the page?
22:06  Ankabout: I have a page of lots of little <div> squares. And I want them all to appear in a cool way, by flying in, or spinning in or something, one by one.
22:06  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: your code will still be parsed by the html parser, and that can mess things up badly if your unlucky
22:06  Cork[home]: (before its run by the js engin)
22:07  WoNHommer: so for html5 doctype I should use <!--//--><![CDATA[//>?
22:07  Cork[home]: no
22:07  Cork[home]: thats xhtml
22:07  thisoneguy2010: is there a javascript validator?
22:07  Cork[home]: in text/html
22:07  Cork[home]: ?jslint
22:07  bot-t: JSLint, The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
22:08  Jonz: ankabout you were right, jquery can do that
22:08  b1lly: anyone see a problem with that? it's not showing the value
22:08  Ankabout: and.. any suggestion on how?
22:08  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: if your using html of any kind just a simple <!--   //--> is all you need
22:08  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: but thats only needed to be safe
22:08  Ankabout: they're all 1st level children of a parent div
22:09  WoNHommer: Cork[home]: well I'll do that anyway, thx for the advice
22:09  Jonz: ?animate
22:09  bot-t: .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
22:09  Jonz: ^— ankabout
22:10  WoNHommer: please it's killing me... -.-'
22:10  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: what is?
22:10  WoNHommer: can't I use [] in the field name for the validation plugin?
22:10  ionas: WoNHommer, http header type = application/xml => I think CDATA, type = text/html - then no CDATA
22:10  WoNHommer: http://pastebin.com/WbVJhBkT <- line 6 is breaking the code
22:11  ajpiano: WoNHommer, youcan't have a dynamic key name in an object lieral
22:11  Ankabout: thanks Jonz looks like that'll help!
22:11  WoNHommer: it's not a dynamic key name
22:11  Cork[home]: ionas: exactly thats why you need the messed up line if your useing xhtml in text/html
22:11  ajpiano: WoNHommer: oh, lol
22:11  WoNHommer: it's just the name of the input
22:11  ajpiano: WoNHommer, put the keyname in quotes
22:11  WoNHommer: <input name="data[User][confirme_a_senha]">
22:11  Jonz: ankabout if you want it to do some spinny stuff you might have to get crazy with some non-standard css properties or try out a plugin like zoomooz
22:11  Vorspire: so User is not a variable, it's a string?
22:11  Vorspire: then use "User"
22:12  Jonz: good luck with it
22:12  Ankabout: don't like too much crazyness
22:12  Ankabout: I want something like this: www.universaleverything.com
22:12  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: donno much about the validator plugin; but you normally need to escape [] in selectors
22:12  WoNHommer: how? with \?
22:12  Cork[home]: ya
22:12  Ankabout: just the way the black boxes appear, not the very annoying animations and lights and epilepsy stuff
22:12  WoNHommer: let me try
22:13  b1lly: anyone see if I did anything wrong? http://pastebin.com/a0XZF55f ... i'm trying to get the value of the drop down list everytime someone changes it on the fly, and pass teh variable to php
22:13  WoNHommer: did not work -> http://pastebin.com/xUNyZ09B
22:14  WoNHommer: I don't think it's reading it right..
22:14  Cork[home]: WoNHommer: "data\[User\]\[confirme_a_senha\]" or 'data\[User\]\[confirme_a_senha\]'
22:14  ajpiano: ffs
22:14  letsplaypogs: fps
22:14  WoNHommer: it needs to be a string? cause for other simple names, it doesn't need the quotes..
22:14  Cork[home]: you can't have it as a key if you have [] in them
22:14 * letsplaypogs plays aj's piano
22:14  Cork[home]: or space for that matter :)
22:14  thisoneguy2010: this is weird, page is good in IE but not FF.  this dosn't happen very often

22:15  WoNHommer: ohh

22:19  WoNHommer: erichynds: yeah
22:19  erichynds: without looking at the error message throwmn
22:19  WoNHommer: erichynds: use valid()

22:24  bartzy: :(
22:24  borkweb: b1lly: when you change the select box, does it at least make an ajax request now?
22:24  thisoneguy2010: ok, so now there there is hardly any markup

22:24  bartzy: ajpiano: So if I want to know when a future-inserted <img> will finish loading , I can't do it ?
22:25  khinester: Cork[home]: should be just 'json'
22:25  ajpiano: bartzy, you can bind a load event to it at the time that you put it in to the dom
22:25  bartzy: ajpiano: OK, thanks.
22:25  borkweb: b1lly: the request is being made successfully (if you use firebug you can see the request go through along with the response)
22:26  bartzy: ajpiano: It still doesn't exist because I load it with AJAX
22:26  borkweb: if you want the year to display on that page, you will need to handle that with JS
22:26  b1lly: ya but how come its not printing the $variable
22:26  b1lly: $test*
22:26  ajpiano: right and then when the ajaxcall  comes back, you bind the load event, bartzy
22:26  bartzy: but maybe I can create an empty <img> and just change its src along AJAX requests...
22:26  ajpiano: yup
22:26  ajpiano: there's the ticket'
22:26  bartzy: ticket ?
22:26  borkweb: Because at page render time, that $_POST variable doesn't exist
22:26  ajpiano: the right approach

22:41  ajavid: ?
22:41  ajavid: oh ok
22:41  ajavid: thought so
22:41  ajavid: how can I make it go into the streampublish function where url (the last param) is

22:41  ajavid: just move the whole stream publish function into .get?
22:41  ajavid: i mean the call to that function
22:41  erichynds: fixxxermet, you're returning data out of the $.post but not out of the function itself
22:41  ajpiano: ajavid, call that function from inside the ajax callback
22:42  hemanth: erichynds, load(url) just loads the contents but no style sheets and js as they will be in relative paths, whats the work around?

22:43  ajpiano: what
22:44  ajpiano: do WHAT in a callback ... of what
22:44  erichynds: hemanth, put the styles on the page that's loading the content
22:45  snollux: There's a function that uses .load() to call a PHP script which outputs another form in another div. I'm using the load callback to [hopefully] get this event bound to the drop-down selector in question
22:46  hemanth: erichynds, http://b.../~xyz so on are the url's, i want to load that to a div, based on a search box, where the ~ part is given, load() is loading only the text in the div
22:46  snollux: which is generated by a PHP/SQL query based on the first form
22:46  Benji-: ajpiano: Well, I simply have had no luck getting the Plupload plug-in to work. I'm wondering if anyone here is familair with it, and getting it setup.
22:46  ajpiano: Benji-, i never have, but i'm confident that it actually does work... you should put  up a testpage to show people how your attempt to implement it is failing
22:47  ajavid: hey
22:47  ajavid: does .get issue an alert?
22:47  ajavid: or something
22:47  ajavid: http://pastie.org/1230938
22:47  bartzy: if I do if($('#this_doesnt_exist').length), it will return false ?
22:47  bartzy: meaning it will enter the if ?
22:47  ajavid: why do I get an alertbox?
22:48  ajpiano: bartzy, 0 == false, anything nonzero == true
22:48  snollux: okay, ajpiano, I've got    $('#typeSelect').change(function() { alert("Customer Clinic")}); }); working.Now I just need to make the alert happen only if the option labeled "Customer Clinic" is the one selected
22:48  Benji-: ajpiano: Well, the reason I ask in that manner is because I can't get it working with the included examples, it's driving me crazy.
22:48  fixxxermet: erichynds: I understand what you mean..  How do I do that?  If I put the return outside of the post function, it's data is not defined.
22:48  ajpiano: snollux if ($(this).val() == "Customer Clinic") {}
22:48  ajavid: ajpiano, look at my pate if you can
22:49  snollux: okay.
22:49 --- Underscore_ is now known as Underscore
22:49  ajavid: why am I getting an alertbox
22:49  ajavid: when it makes the ajax .get request
22:49  ajavid: it gives me alertbox
22:49  ajavid: why?
22:50  erichynds: fixxxermet, looks like a design problem.. you should put anything that relies on that ajax request inside the success handler
22:50  ajpiano: i have no idea, that has a lot to do with what the streamPublishYourOwn function does
22:50  ajavid: http://pastie.org/1230947
22:50  ajavid: ajpiano,
22:50  ajavid: oh goddamit
22:50  ajavid: stupid stupid me
22:50  ajavid: I haven't eaten anythign or drank anything or fucking smoked anything
22:50  ajavid: :/
22:51  ajavid: nevermind my dumb ass.
22:51  ajpiano: ...
22:51 * ajavid had a stupid alert call in there.
22:51  ajpiano: maybe you shouldn't have said anything :p
22:51  sneakyness: :X
22:51 * ajavid facepalm

22:52  fixxxermet: erichynds: I could easily do the whole post inside the select.change function, but was hoping to resume more of my code?
22:53 --- Bertrand is now known as Bertrand`
22:53  erichynds: fixxxermet, you could do the ajax call, then call a success handler function
22:54  fixxxermet: hmm
22:54 * Benji- gives up
22:55  darkangel: Is there a function to determine if an event handler has already been bound to an element?
22:56  ajavid: ajpiano, i got something for ya
22:56  ajavid: ajpiano, dank.
22:57  ajavid: give me time.
22:57  topher: my brain is a bit fried so my apologies if this is an odd or dumb question. ive got the results of a complex query stored in javascript and i'd like to post it as json data to a page (via the ajax post stuff) but ... i want that posted-to-file to be offered as a download, e.g. set the content-type on an ajax call to something like that of a csv file. is what im talking about even remotely possible (e.g. generate and cause a download via jquery ajax)?
22:58  ajpiano: topher: all you have to do is window.location.href = "urlofthepagewherethecontentisservedwithcontenttypeattachment"
22:58  erichynds: fixxxermet, dunno http://pastie.org/1230966
22:58  ^Lestat: topher you can write it to a csv file then serve it
22:59 --- Evixion` is now known as Evixion
22:59  topher: ah ok, but before i do the window.location.href bit, i'd like to POST to that page so the page can generate the csv from the POST data. is that possible?
23:00  topher: so it's kind of a POST-then-redirect, i suppose
23:00  topher: ah wait, im an idiot. isnt this just basically submitting a form and the page that form goes to sets it content-type so the browser offers a download instead of changing the page?
23:00  ajpiano: topher: yeah, you do the ajax call to the other page, and then when the ajax call is done, you use the callback to redirect them to the page with the content
23:01  ajpiano: pretty much
23:01  topher: bah, thank you both. i knew it was just my fried brain
23:01  RingZer0: anyone ever done an async form post() to includ <input type files> ?
23:02 --- Underscore_ is now known as Underscore
23:02  RingZer0: I am using $(this).serialize() as the data argument ... but server-side I do not see the file upload
23:03 * RingZer0 looks around for temp01, paulirish, or one of his buds that can help with these kinds of things.
23:03  mattmtl: in a $.ajax call, and in the success parameter, I recall the ajax call with settimout and I give a value of 10seconds.... I really don't understand why the ajax fonction is recalled each millisecond
23:03  temp01: sup
23:03  ajpiano: RingZer0: the only way to do an ajax post of input type file is to use an iframe to do the upload, this is done in the see ?ajaxForm
23:03  bot-t: RingZer0, ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
23:04  erichynds: mattmtl, how are you expressing 10 seconds?
23:04  RingZer0: temp01, how's it going friend. :)
23:04  mattmtl: erichynds:  setTimeout(callItself(), 10000)
23:05  erichynds: mattmtl, ditch the () around callItself
23:05  RingZer0: ajpiano, alright.  I'll look into the plugin... kinda bummed the $.ajax() wouldn't support that.
23:05  mattmtl: erichynds: but if I need to pass an argument to the function?
23:05  erichynds: mattmtl: closures :)
23:06  erichynds: function callItself( foo ){ return function(){ /* logic here */ } });
23:06  erichynds: or just setTimeout(function(){ callItself() }, 10000);

23:09  sbryant_work: is there debug output for jquery?
23:10  snollux: ajpiano: okay, this is mostly working.. however, it only works if "Customer Clinic" is the ONLY item selected, rather than among the items selected.. Is there a javascript equivalent to java's .contains()?
23:10  ajpiano: snollux: it's a select multiple ?
23:10  snollux: yes.
23:10  ajpiano: ?jQuery.inArray @ snollux

23:19  Phrogz: snollux: What are you asking?
23:20  ajpiano: snollux: the array is what's returned by $("#selectmultiple").val() (unless it's null)
23:20  Phrogz: Renegade001: I see '{"error":"Rate limit exceeded. Clients may not make more than 150 requests per hour.","request":"/1/statuses/user_timeline.json?screen_name=renegademaniac"}'
23:20  snollux: Phrogz: basically, I want an easy way to determine, in .change(), whether one of the options selected in a  dropdown structure is "Customer Clinic"
23:20  snollux: okay, great
23:21  Phrogz: snollux: You could do that with just a selector, right?
23:21  Renegade001: Phrogz: I get absolutely nothing :/
23:22  Phrogz: $('#myselect option:selected:contains('Customer Clinic')').length
23:22  Phrogz: Renegade001: I mean, when I request that URL directly from my browser, before getting any jQuery involved.
23:23  Renegade001: Oh, yea I get data when I do that but with jQuery, absolutely nothing :/
23:23  losing: Renegade001: shouldnt that be a cross domain request?
23:23  ajpiano: snollux $("#selectmultiple").change(function() { if ($.inArray("Customer Clinic",$(this).val() || []) > -1) {  alert("it's there");  }   });
23:24  Renegade001: losing: Could you elaborate?
23:24 --- palhmbs_ is now known as palhmbs
23:24  losing: Renegade001: you cannot make an AJAX request across domains unless you use something like JSONP
23:25  Renegade001: Ah I see :)
23:25  Renegade001: So any advice? :D
23:25  losing: you should be getting an error in your console
23:25  losing: Renegade001: There are a few solutions, you can use JSONP or create a proxy on your own domain
23:26  Renegade001: Yea, I think I'd rather jsonp :D
23:26  Renegade001: use*
23:26  losing: Renegade001: to use that the Twitter API has to support it
23:26  losing: Renegade001: Im not sure that it does
23:34  poppiez: hi, I'm using the cookie plugin (http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.cookie.js.txt). I'm having problems with overwriting a cookie with a new value. it just won't update the cookie. is it possible to do?
23:35  losing: poppiez: can we see your code?
23:35  losing: poppiez: it is definitely possible to do
23:38  poppiez: losing: no, don't have it hosted. but alright, if you say it's possible I just have to dig in :D
23:38  poppiez: thx buddy
23:38  losing: poppiez: you can just paste the relevant portion using jsfiddle.com or jsbin.com or pastie.org

23:47  aaroninfidel: hi all, can someone tell me how I can remove the labels automatically appended when getting errors from jquery.validate? http://beta.fonlabs.us/appointment
23:48  losing: sbryant_work: are you using Chrome + console or Firefox + Firebug?
23:49  k1ng__: someone please recommend me a movie...

23:49  losing: poppiez: are you updating the cookie for the same domain that it was original set?
23:49  Phrogz: aaroninfidel: Easiest? How about just using CSS to display:none them?

23:51  losing: I tend to use it as a breaking point
23:51  sbryant_work: ajpiano: lol.
23:51  losing: console.log("I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE)
23:51  sbryant_work: ajpiano: still having issues with dialogs
23:51  losing: sbryant_work: and what events might those be?
23:51  aaroninfidel: Phrogz: from what I've tried so far, it hasn't worked for me.
23:52  sbryant_work: click events.
23:52  Phrogz: aaroninfidel: I'm not sure how to respond to that.
23:52  ajpiano: and in what way aren't they working
23:53  sbryant_work: after the dialog is opened for the first time I cannot open it again
23:53  mathi_: hi
23:53  losing: sbryant_work: what is triggering the dialog to open?
23:53  sbryant_work: and I can't get any reason as to why
23:53  losing: sbryant_work: is it an element that is being removed and readded to the DOM?
23:53  aaroninfidel: Phrogz: sorry, what would you suggest I call the class for it to be dominant enough to hide the element?
23:54  mathi_: I want to trigger a callback function: click event on a checkbox. $("input.allDay").triggerHandler("click");  doesn't seem to work, the callback is not triggered
23:54  sbryant_work: a function bound to a click hander on an input element
23:54  ajpiano: ?p @ sbryant_work
23:54  bot-t: sbryant_work, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
23:54  losing: mathi_: $("input.allDay").click();
23:54  Phrogz: aaroninfidel: label.error { display:none!important } ?
23:54  mathi_: losing, yea but that will change the checkbox value
23:55  losing: mathi_: yes, clicking a checkbox tends to change its value
23:55  sbryant_work: hold on sorry
23:55  mathi_: losing, that's why I used triggerHandler, unfortunately doesn't work
23:55  poppiez: losing: btw, I'm setting the cookie on localhost. dunno if that has something to say
