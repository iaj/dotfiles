00:00  soreau: I know it's not directly related to jquery but where else can I ask?
00:00  gnarf: peter2: checked .value ?
00:01  qq99: ajpiano, thanks
00:01 @ajpiano: hm, true
00:01  Kambfhase: peter2: I dont think so, for privacy reasons
00:02  peter2: gnarf: $('#myfile').val() returns C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg
00:02  gnarf: ?eval "C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg".match(/[^\\/]+$/)
00:02  bot-t: gnarf: ["C:\fakepathmyimage.jpg"]
00:02  gnarf: huh
00:02  gnarf: oops
00:02  gnarf: ?eval "C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg".match(/[^\\\/]+$/)
00:02  bot-t: gnarf: ["C:\fakepathmyimage.jpg"]
00:03  gnarf: doh
00:03  gnarf: ?eval "C:\\fakepath\\myimage.jpg".match(/[^\\/]+$/)
00:03  bot-t: gnarf: ["myimage.jpg"]
00:03  peter2: hooray
00:03  peter2: wait why the double backslashes in the path there though
00:04  gnarf: peter2: ?eval "test\test"
00:04  peter2: ?eval "C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg".match(/[^\\/]+$/)
00:04  bot-t: peter2: ["C:\fakepathmyimage.jpg"]
00:04  gnarf: ?eval "test\test"
00:04  bot-t: gnarf: "test\test"
00:04  gnarf: you need \\ for strings (usually)
00:04  gnarf: ?eval "\m"
00:04  bot-t: gnarf: "m"
00:05  gnarf: ?eval "\\m"
00:05  bot-t: gnarf: "\m"
00:05  gnarf: you wont need the doubles cuz the var has it defined properly
00:05  gnarf: the you need em in the RE too, \\\/ prolly safest
00:06  gnarf: "\" being the escape character for strings / RE
00:06  gnarf: ?eval "\n" for instance is a newline
00:06  bot-t: gnarf: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
00:06  peter2: but if the string contains single backslashes? C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg
00:06  gnarf: peter2: then the string already contains them
00:06  gnarf: if you are defining a string to contain single backslashes:
00:07  gnarf: ?eval print("C:\\fakepath\\myimage.jpg")
00:07  bot-t: gnarf: "C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg"
00:07  gnarf: you need to escape em
00:07  gnarf: which is why windows should give up on the backslash
00:07  gnarf: as a dir seperator
00:07  peter2: ?eval "C:\fakepath\myimage.jpg".match(/[^\\\/]+$/)
00:07  bot-t: peter2: ["C:\fakepathmyimage.jpg"]
00:08  gnarf: "\f" is probably some formatting char
00:08  peter2: the thing is im not using windows but the literal path i'm getting is C:\fakepath\
00:08  gnarf: instead of an actual "\"
00:08  gnarf: peter2: its a nice browser then
00:08  gnarf: obfuscating your real path
00:08  gnarf: :)
00:08  peter2: chrome
00:09  peter2: well i just wanted to test if an image filename already existed before uploading but maybe i should just handle this part with php
00:09  gnarf: the .match(/[^\\\/]+$/) will match
00:09  gnarf: trust
00:09  gnarf: try it on the .val()
00:09  gnarf: console.log it
00:09  gnarf: it should give you everything AFTER the last "\" or "/" in the string
00:11  gnarf: bbiab
00:11  peter2: gnarf: $('#photo').val().match(/[^\\\/]+$/)  returns just the filename :]
00:11  gnarf: thats what you wanted right??
00:11  peter2: yup
00:11  gnarf: coo

01:52  mdunham918_: another issue
01:52  mdunham918_: its master slave
01:52  mdunham918_: he has it offset on the increase to +10
01:53  mdunham918_: so every new record's id is +10 of the last one
01:53  mdunham918_: so that reduces the total number of id's by a factor of 10
01:53  mdunham918_: is there something better than int?
01:53  mdunham918_: to allow for largers ids
01:53  mdunham918_: should just switch to textual ids

02:59  Carneque: Nicolas, do you know what an array is?
03:00  qq99: Nicolas_Leonidas, you prob want a jquery table sort, as I assume you're talking about <table>
03:00  qq99: Nicolas_Leonidas, if so, check out dataTables
03:03  jorn: hey, if i use the ajax beforeSend callback, i can return false to cancel the ajax request... but what's the "go on" return value?
03:06  RTPMatt: jorn: if false makes it stop, a truthy value should make it go one.  sucha as, true.
03:06  RTPMatt: *on

04:15  ProLoser|Work: ProLoser|Work	does anyone here use jquerytools?
04:15  jayd: hi!!! need a good programmer,,,anyone?
04:15  ProLoser|Work: jayd: for what
04:17  jayd: need to make a good software
04:17  ProLoser|Work: ya that's too vague
04:17  jayd: whats too vague, looking for a programmer?
04:18  ProLoser|Work: yes
04:18  ProLoser|Work: what language, what software, what company, what do you have to offer, etc
04:18  ProLoser|Work: all of freenode are programmers
04:19  Vorspire: jayd; what you need?
04:20  jayd: I want an academic software that could be used for administration results and so on
04:20  jayd: I work for a company and they are ready to absorb a good programmer
04:21  jayd: we could get talking on the renumerations
04:21  ProLoser|Work: what language
04:21  jayd: Java?
04:21  ProLoser|Work: so it's a desktop app?
04:21  Vorspire: eww :P
04:22  jayd: yup
04:22  ProLoser|Work: jquery is not really where you ask for 'programmers'
04:22  ProLoser|Work: designers maybe, but you should go to #java
04:22  ProLoser|Work: if it's in java
04:22  ProLoser|Work: or ##php if it's in php :)
04:22  Vorspire: i specialize in c# desktop apps.. but java.. eww :P
04:22  ProLoser|Work: etc
04:22  Tallisman: Vorspire, isn't C++ faster?
04:22  Vorspire: for gaming, yes
04:23  Vorspire: if you want to do calculus, use C++
04:23  jayd: wats with java
04:23  Tallisman: but you are specialized in both or just C#?
04:23  jayd: is it complicated?
04:23  Tallisman: java != complicated, it is fun to play with :P
04:23  ProLoser|Work: java is slow
04:23  Tallisman: however slow
04:23  ProLoser|Work: but not complicated
04:23  ProLoser|Work: it's also cross-compatible
04:24  Tallisman: but for desktop applications it is awsome
04:24  Vorspire: I'm just specialized in C#
04:24  ProLoser|Work: but at that point i prefer the web
04:24  Tallisman: (as long as the user has java installed, which all computers have these days)
04:24  Vorspire: I never learned C#... I can write LOLCode tho :D
04:24  Vorspire: never learned C++*
04:24  Tallisman: me to Vorspire :P
04:24  ProLoser|Work: i used to teach java
04:24  ProLoser|Work: heh
04:24  Tallisman: C++ is like - Damnunlogical xD
04:24  ProLoser|Work: it's used in schools cuz it's free
04:24  Tallisman: you were :O?
04:25  Tallisman: wow respect :]
04:25  Tallisman: Bluej? heard that one is populair in edu..
04:25  Vorspire: Tallisman, do you work with C#?
04:25  jayd: @proloser, can u design a software like an academic database, etc?
04:25  whitebook: ANyone know a good table row adder
04:25  ProLoser|Work: what's bluej?
04:25  Tallisman: i can write basic programs yes, can't write games with it though
04:25  Vorspire: whitebook; what do you mean? you need code that will add rows to a table?
04:25  ProLoser|Work: jayd: probably, but i work in php/cakephp now
04:26  ProLoser|Work: mvc frameworks + databases ftw
04:26  whitebook: I want to add rows to a table like structure
04:26  ProLoser|Work: and i'm no java elite
04:26  Tallisman: but C# is far more logical than c++, it is higher, so that is logical :P
04:26  whitebook: then save that back
04:26  Tallisman: if you really want speed you do assembly.. >.<
04:26  ProLoser|Work: we had an enterprise java consultant working here, but he got fired cuz he didn't know his frameworks very well (jboss seam)
04:27  whitebook: jboss seam is hard stuff
04:27  Tallisman: i totally adored the gridBagLayout.
04:27  ProLoser|Work: whitebook: it's freaking obscure is what it is
04:27  whitebook: P-O-S
04:27  ProLoser|Work: i could not find a lot of help, and the consultant didn't know crap
04:27  Vorspire: Tallisman, I love C# :D I'm a developer on WCell and RunUO and have written my own WebServer service (open sourced)... I love C# and everything it can do and how powerful it can be :D
04:28  whitebook: Piece of S**
04:28  Vorspire: but there are still things that C# can't do that C++ can :(
04:28  whitebook: I really want some elegant code to help me add rows to a table;
04:28  Tallisman: what site is your webserver server to download from?, i'll bookmark it
04:28  whitebook: I am looking in the jQuery plugins for something
04:28  Tallisman: then i'll try it out once :]
04:28  whitebook: I am too lazy to write it;
04:28  Vorspire: http://webserverlite.codeplex.com
04:28  Vorspire: I'ts in Stable-Beta 1.2
04:29  Vorspire: 1.3 will come soon :P
04:29  Vorspire: so not really worth using 1.2 Tallisman
04:29  ProLoser|Work: whitebook: was the pos seam?
04:29  whitebook: Piece of Sh.....
04:29  whitebook: Yea
04:29  ProLoser|Work: yes, were you referring to SEAM?
04:30  whitebook: I cant believe I wasted months of my life with that garbage
04:30  Vorspire: whitebook; I've been working on a silly basic grid plugin on JSFiddle.. you could steal my code and use it yourself if you want, but you'd have to strip off the tetris-game code at the start :P
04:30  Tallisman: yea i'll check it out.. now i got to get my snack, brb
04:30  whitebook: whats that jsfiddle
04:30  whitebook: Is it usable? Or it ned swork still>
04:30  ProLoser|Work: a pastebin site for js
04:31  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/
04:31  ProLoser|Work: ~bin
04:31  whitebook: Ohl I know jsfiddle I was asking for the link which you just sent
04:31  whitebook: :)
04:31  ProLoser|Work: how do i rotate?
04:31  wesbos: anyone know if its possible to load a fragment of a page and store in a variable?
04:31  Vorspire: whitebook; that fiddle there, half way down is a comment stating where the grid plugin starts, just remove everything above the comment
04:31  Tallisman: got my snacks ^^
04:31  ProLoser|Work: wesbos: yes, it is possible
04:32  wesbos: .load only lets me load into an element. and .get / .ajax doesnt accept page fragments
04:32  Tallisman: anyhow, i got a question, what is the fastest way to store a javascript variable without cookies or sessions?
04:32  Vorspire: Tallisman, with var? :D
04:33  wesbos: proLoser: how?
04:33  Vorspire: do you mean physically store it?
04:33  ProLoser|Work: wesbos: look at the docs in the ajax section
04:33  Tallisman: nah i mean, that if you reload the page the variable doesn't change from the last time you visited :P
04:33  Vorspire: ahhhhh
04:33  Vorspire: I guess PHP would be required there
04:33  Tallisman: good example.. i want to make a javascript counter to countdown to newyear ^^
04:34  Tallisman: but i do not want the countdown to be changed :]
04:34  whitebook: Vorspire: Can I edit it this or will I ruin your work
04:34  Vorspire: whitebook; click the Fork button :)
04:34  wesbos: proloser : I need to specify the fragment, so for example div #jQuery
04:35  whitebook: Thx; Got it;
04:35  Tallisman: probably requires cronjobs anyway - the countdown (or i can store the variable with php in a mysql page > or file, depends on the speed..) and continue the timer when you return to the page
04:35  Vorspire: Tallisman, use an equation that is based on current date/time and compare it to a hard-coded date/time for the new year, then minu the difference
04:36  ProLoser|Work: wesbos: sorry i thought i saw it somewhere
04:36  Tallisman: true, for that kind of countdown it is indeed smart :P
04:36  ProLoser|Work: anyway i gotta go, gl
04:36  whitebook: Vorspire: Any controls to add rows or I have to write that?
04:36  whitebook: I see th emethods are all there
04:36  whitebook: the methids
04:36  Vorspire: whitebook, save what you have and post me your link, i'll add a couple examples for you :)
04:36  whitebook: methods
04:37  whitebook: http://jsfiddle.net/zdPba/
04:37  Tallisman: in this case it would be a timer you could just write the amount of seconds and javascript will loop through it
04:38  Tallisman: but what is the fastest way to store a variable for later use?
04:38  ProLoser|Work: hey real quick i gotta question for everyone in here
04:38  Tallisman: mysql/files/cookies/sessions.. etc
04:38  ProLoser|Work: a: does anyone here use jquerytools, and b: how is it different/better than base jquery?
04:39  Tallisman: i don't use it :P <-- just to let you know i read and care about your question :]
04:40  ProLoser|Work: :) dankeshan
04:41  ProLoser|Work: okay i'm getting sidetracked, time to close up shop
04:45  Vorspire: whitebook; sorry it took so long, baby was crying :P http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/zdPba/2/

04:52  whitebook: Thanks so much for your helo
04:53  whitebook: help
04:53  Vorspire: but if you want to always add a row to the bottom for example, you can do: grid.addRow( grid.rowCount - 1 ); which will add 1 row at the end :)

04:57  whitebook: I did a quick test on that page to add the rows
04:57  whitebook: I put an add button
04:57  whitebook: so maybe this would work if I can just put some content in there

09:03  matt__: crab: Codeigniter is a framework
09:03  matt__: I have all the resposes coming in JSON
09:03  matt__: but its not generating the drop down
09:04  danheberden: matt__: you've used a debugger to view the ajax request data to verify proper json, etc, ya?
09:04  matt__: danheberden: yes
09:04  matt__: that has come from firebug
09:04  matt__: unless there is something further i can do?
09:04  danheberden: just make sure your response from your server/CI framework is legit
09:04  danheberden: and formatted the way the autocomplete wants
09:05  danheberden: as outlined in the examples on the demo page
09:05  danheberden: you could make a small example on jsfiddle with the autocomplete and just use the returned data copied from firebug as a static source object
09:05  danheberden: so we can poke around
09:05  matt__: well that part of the issue, the examples dont have examples !!
09:06  matt__: however its pretty basic
09:06  matt__: sure
09:07  danheberden: matt__:  jqueryui demo data: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/search.php?term=as

09:12  danheberden: ServerSage: disabling options isn't completely cross browsers
09:12  ServerSage: danheberden: Aaah, ok.  So removing the options and adding them again is the better route?
09:13  danheberden: its the only alternative that comes to mind
09:13  ServerSage: danheberden: Thats what I needed to know.  Just wanted to make sure it wasn't something I fat fingered in.
09:16  matt__: danheberden: my response matches the exmaple
09:16  matt__: still doesnt work, but hey one step at a time!
09:17  danheberden: matt__: well there's also the work of using the response in your callback
09:17  matt__: danheberden:  should i be using this example: ? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
09:17  danheberden: matt__: if you're using jsonp
09:18  danheberden: most likely, you're just using json
09:18  matt__: yeah i am
09:18  danheberden: plain ol' json: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
09:19  danheberden: see how the callback uses the id and value?
09:19  matt__: yeah
09:19  matt__: i need to use POST, also
09:19  danheberden: oh, nvm on the callback
09:19  danheberden: i forgot label is auto
09:19  crab: oh that reminds me i should hack up all my autocompletes to use a hash instead of an array. ugh. i'd forgotten about that.
09:19  danheberden: ( i had to tweak the shit out of my AC on a recent project )
09:19 * crab goes to do it right away
09:19  danheberden: chip chop!
09:20  matt__: danheberden: do you have an exmaple?
09:21  crab: i really hate having to make this change.
09:21  danheberden: matt__: ui does: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
09:22  danheberden: in mine, i sent a type so that the results would be styled accordingly

09:44  Chandu: i have provided the hyperlinks infront of image src tags danheberden
09:44  danheberden: so when you use a hyperlink, it's not going to be all encompasing
09:44  jomofcw: Hello =)
09:44  danheberden: Chandu: aye, but that's not how the plugin operates
09:44  danheberden: Chandu: perhaps you could set a click event on the div instead?
09:44  danheberden: the parent one?
09:45  danheberden: you're gonna have to work around how the plugin works, from the looks of it

09:46  Chandu: please let me know clearly
09:46  danheberden: Chandu: because the plugin can't parse your <a> tags properly

10:00  danheberden: Chandu: it conflicts with the plugin - not jquery. i would suggest manually attaching a click handler to the parent div and opening your window via javascript

10:21  danheberden: _nix00: either i've had too much rum, or that doesn't quite sound like an logical question
10:22  danheberden: like, you have an ajax request in to the click handler of an element
10:22  danheberden: and you want the click of an other element to trigger it?

12:52  temp01: you should use a plugin/method or do your filtering using filter
12:52  alaing: that look for
12:52  temp01: you can do like $('div .foo .blah').filter(':myawesomeselector')
12:52  alaing: would that be cheaper?
12:53  temp01: yes
12:53  temp01: since jquery can use querySelector for selecting 'div .foo .blah' then filter using the custom selector
12:54  alaing: :myNOTsoawesomeselector is looking for specific custom attribute value
12:54  temp01: if you mix the custom selector then querySelector won't work and jquery will have to manually select using getElementsByTagName, ClassName etc and that'll be slow

12:54  alaing: i see
12:55  alaing: I'm getting long run error message in IE and I recon this is the cause
12:55  alaing: firefox is fine
12:55  temp01: well
12:55  soee: can i get visible browser area size not full (visible + scroll)
12:56  temp01: IE6/7 does not have querySelector so most of what I'm saying doesn't apply there
12:56  johnline: omg this is getting stupid
12:56  temp01: soee: $(window).height()
12:56  johnline: cant just make an swf window clickable
12:56  alaing: temp01 u lost me..
12:57  temp01: ie doesn't have querySelector. jquery will always manually select elements using getElementsByTagName etc no matter what you do
12:57  sean`: eff that
12:58  sean`: Give all your elements an ID
12:58  sean`: I do that too http://pastie.org/1337805
12:58  alaing: I figured ID would be a good option but I'm looking up loads of tr
12:59  johnline: anyone here got ie6?
12:59  sean`: xaa, http://jsfiddle.net/6QXyK/2/
12:59  alaing: temp01 oh ok no difference in IE between $('div').filter(':selector') and $('div:selector')

13:09  alaing: glen1: i dont think so
13:09  glen1: ahh, can they a function access vars that are outside it then?
13:10  alaing: glen1: you can declare a value outside and access it from inside and then use it again outside
13:10  glen1: so var something =1; function start()
13:10  glen1: lol
13:10  glen1: ill do that then

13:45  abracsi: i was following along with ajpiano's slideshow

13:46  JKarsrud: which one?
13:46  abracsi: 	
13:46  abracsi: $.widget("aj.filterable"
13:46  JKarsrud: Link me up to the slideshow?
13:46  abracsi: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide5
13:47  JKarsrud: you'd call it using filtarable anyway, I guess
13:47  abracsi: really?
13:47  JKarsrud: It's just to namespace the widget, but you don't use the namespace when calling it
13:48  abracsi: oh right
13:48  JKarsrud: If you look at all his other slides that come after that one, he doesn't use it
13:50  abracsi: oh really?
13:50  JKarsrud: Try it?
13:51  visof: hello
13:51  abracsi: yeh. something is not working
13:51  abracsi: :(
13:51  JKarsrud: Code plz? :)
13:51  visof: there is something i want to do but i can't how, i want to have select box with some values when i choose a value , i got another select box belongs to that value under it "ajax"
13:53  abracsi: http://jsfiddle.net/Luke/dSxz2/1/
13:53  visof: or i want to do : when choose value from select box i got redirect to another page just as click a link
13:53  visof: can i do that ?
13:54  JKarsrud: visof: No problem, just listen for the change event on the select box, and redirect from there
13:54  visof: JKarsrud: how ?
13:55  JKarsrud: $('select').change(function() { location.href = $(this).val(); }) ;
13:55  JKarsrud: For the redirect
13:55  JKarsrud: If the value of the option is the url ofc
13:56  visof: JKarsrud: are you using Rails ?
13:56  JKarsrud: nope
13:58  Trisox: wy you ask visof cause he is on a roll ^^ ?

13:58  JKarsrud: I'm looking at it :)
13:59  abracsi: ah thanks :-)
13:59  mekwall: abracsi: will go much easier if you actually include jquery ui

14:00  mekwall: JKarsrud: always check the power cable first ;)
14:00  abracsi: ah man. gotta be a mistake you make once :-p
14:00  JKarsrud: Even checked if he was including jquery, but didn't see that jquery ui was unchecked :P

14:06  benlangfeld: Hey guys. I'm using jQuery-ui modal dialogs for forms and I'd like to have the form submit when hitting return. This doesn't seem to work without a button present in the form, and I can't find an event that's fired on hitting return. Does anyone know of a better option than including a hidden button in the form?

14:06  abracsi: benlangfeld.. tried keyup event?

14:07  mekwall: benlangfeld: $(form).keydown(function(e){ if (e.which == 13) { $(this).submit(); return false; }});
14:07  abracsi: if (event.which == "13")  i think
14:07  JKarsrud: mekwall: No e.preventDefault() ? :(

14:07  JKarsrud: god?
14:07  mekwall: I am
14:08  temp01: dog?
14:08  JKarsrud: ahh, why not just look for the submit event in first place
14:08  JKarsrud: Makes more sense
14:08  mekwall: benlangfeld: e.preventDefault(); instead of return false :p
14:08  JKarsrud: But then you'd need a submitbutton in the form
14:08  benlangfeld: JKarsrud: Look for the submit event? It's not fired yet
14:09  benlangfeld: Thanks guys, I'll give that a go
14:09  abracsi: u dont actually need a submit button on a form though to make return submit the form do you?

14:10  abracsi: hmm. i'm sceptical. i'm sure we did a search field recently that didnt have a search button and hitting return would submit the form anyway

14:19  guy: ('input[name=call]').keyup($.debounce(findEntried, 100)); this however, does work
14:19  erichynds: cuz $.debounce returns a function
14:20  guy: well, I tried $('input[name=call]').keyup(function(e){ return $.debounce(findEntried, 100); });
14:20  guy: but it didn't work
14:20  erichynds: right
14:20  erichynds: that just returns a function
14:20  erichynds: without executing anything
14:20  guy: ok. can you then suggest a solution?
14:20  erichynds: use what works - keyup($.debounce(fn,100))
14:21  guy: I need to make something before debounce is even initiated
14:21  guy: like give message (loading)

15:37  ocf|zzz: or .size
15:38  ocf|zzz: I think the official answer is no, its not an array, but jQuery exposes the ability to treat it like one
15:38  sean`: ocf|zzz, .size ()
15:38  ocf|zzz: its .length(), or .size()
15:38  ocf|zzz: sean` - they do the same thing

15:40  JKarsrud: Not my fault that I vote for an issue, and I see your nick in the email notification :P
15:41  ocf|lacks_me: JuJuBee -  you can do $.each(obj, function(key,value) { ... }); as well.. depending on what you're returning
15:46  JKarsrud: temp01: Do you have any idea at all about when the bug might be fixed?
15:46  temp01: it's already fixed in chromium builds
15:46  JKarsrud: Allright
15:46  temp01: what are you using - stable?
15:47  JKarsrud: Yup, Chrome 8.0.552.224 on Windows 7
15:50  JuJuBee: temp01:  so the obj is the response or response.assigns ?
15:51  JuJuBee: ocf|lacks_me: I am returning http://pastie.org/1400367

15:53  Jarda: oste: jsfiddle
15:53  Jarda: but mostly, because you add it to body
15:54  Jarda: you should do $('body').find(':not(h1)').click(...)

15:59  ocf|lacks_me: JuJuBee - yes, you should be able to do $.each(response.assigns, function(key, value) { ... });.. the keys will be 1, 2, 3, 4 and the values will be another set of key/value pairs
15:59  xiu_: the first ajax query gets an id, the second check a page with this id

16:19  erichynds: eponym, does that for loop even run?
16:19  eponym: Yes

16:23  acorah: Hi everyone, quick question, i currently have a div containing a table and some basic rows but when i call html() on the div, it strips the table,tr,td tags away. is this normal? the other text remains and <tr2> etc shows fine, but <tr> and other table code disappears
16:24  eponym: erichynds: They're still appending out of order sometimes, though. Am I doing something wrong in that appendTaskListItemsInOrder function?
16:25  erichynds: well you shouldn't really be calling append() inside a loop to begin with
16:25  erichynds: but i'm not sure as to why they'd be out of order
16:25  eponym: why not, and what should I do instead?
16:26  erichynds: because it's not very performant
16:26  erichynds: you should build html inside a loop and inject it once at the end
16:26  erichynds: so you only hit the DOM once
16:26  erichynds: check to make sure the taskListItems object is being built in order first
16:26  Ely: sean`
16:29  eponym: erichynds: it is not, but it isn't supposed to be. the idea is to build up an unordered collection, then pull from it in the order given by the order array.
16:29  erichynds: ah
16:30  erichynds: you need taskListItems.eq(i).attr(... then probably
16:30  erichynds: or order[i] - not sure what that is
16:32  eponym: I am trying to get item from taskListItems which has id=order[i]... that's the one I want to append first/next
16:32  eponym: Am I mistakenly setting the ID of something with that .attr()?
16:32  erichynds: yep
16:32  erichynds: taskListItems.filter(function(){ this.id === order[i]; })
16:33  erichynds: that'll get you the item with the id of order[i]

17:28  Altreus: tehe
17:28  Altreus: http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9536/screenshot3se.png  I want a plugin that can do this
17:29  Altreus: does there exist such a thing?
17:29  Altreus: the <tr> in the example could be any HTML element whatsoever
17:29  erichynds: probably
17:29  Altreus: so long as it has presence
17:30  Altreus: sean`: I made an example :3
17:30  Altreus: at great expense to the nation
17:31  sean`: Altreus, that's noto that hard man
17:31  sean`: you dont' need CSS to do that
17:31  sean`: JS*
17:31  sean`: perhaps if you wanta  fadeIn/Out, but you can do that with simple CSS
17:31  Altreus: Well I'm using JS already and it's going to do way more than just appear
17:32  sean`: Im' jstu talking about the showing part, not the interactin part
17:32  Altreus: The border has to be overlaid on the surrounding page - it can't disturb it
17:32  Altreus: So I'd need it to be overlaid rather than just styled up
17:33  sean`: get laid
17:33  qq99: are the arrows voting or positioning? just curious
17:34  qq99: @ Altreus
17:34  Altreus: positioning
17:34  qq99: how about drag'n'drop?
17:34  Altreus: sean`: I'd rather have a wank these days
17:34  Brodingo: ha
17:34  qq99: Altreus, less trouble ;P
17:34  Altreus: qq99: that's missing from the design
17:34  Altreus: that already works as it happens :)
17:35  Altreus: sortable++
17:36  qq99: Altreus, maybe implement the style on the right, but make an .inactive style that has no red background and buttons are display:none;
17:36  qq99: then it seems it wouldn't disrupt the page flow when it becomes active
17:36  qq99: as long as the outerbox still has layout
17:36  Altreus: qq99: oh so actually duplicate that box for each movable thing
17:36  qq99: yeah, bonus of that is no jquery markup injecting
17:36  Altreus: hmm I didn't think of that, clearly
17:36  qq99: if it's all already there
17:37  qq99: and the no-js folks can just see the .active style by default? or some variation thereof
17:37  Altreus: bollocks to the no-js folks
17:37  Altreus: They can't use it. It's internal anyway
17:37  qq99: agreed
17:37  qq99: well that's how I might go about it
17:37  Altreus: good thinking
17:38  Altreus: It's an avenue for stuff if nothing else
17:38  Altreus: for ... consideration

17:39  JuJuBee: How do I test if a radio button was selected?  $('#classForm input[type=radio]:checked') ?
17:40  Altreus: that will select it if it was checked ..
17:40  Altreus: use $(selector).checked() to test one you've already got
17:40  Vorspire: $('#classForm:radio:checked') ?
17:40  Altreus: oh - radio, so only one is checked anyway
17:40 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:41  Altreus: JuJuBee: $('input:radio').val() I think will tell you which is selected, or undefined if none

17:52  b1lly: is there a way to do a if ( $(selector).click || $(selector).keyup
17:53  Jarda: what do you mean?
17:53  b1lly: i wanna bind a if the user clisk this element or hits his enter key
17:54  benlangfeld: b1lly: Just write your function and then bind it to both events
17:54  b1lly: im asking how
17:54  b1lly: lol
17:54  garann: b1lly: $(selector).bind("click keyup",...)
17:55  b1lly: oh ocol
17:55  SugaSlide: whoa... fancy seeing you here garann :P btw i dig your site
17:55  delinquentme: HEYY does anyone knwo what that weird dotted rectangle thing around selected items on a page is called .. or what i can use to disable it??
17:55  garann: thanks, SugaSlide :D
17:56  l4rk: oh lol it is garann, fyi after talking to ben alman i'm redoing the templates post
17:56  SugaSlide: delinquentme around links?
17:56  benlangfeld: b1lly: I would have done this: https://gist.github.com/229583c2cdb5b9266a5b
17:56  SugaSlide: delinquentme border?
17:56  garann: delinquentme: outline:none i think..
17:56  benlangfeld: b1lly: garann's jQuery-fu is greater than mine :)
17:56  delinquentme: SugaSlide, actuall i found it    outline:none
17:56  Jarda: garann: garann.com? the layout doesn't work with chrome
17:56  delinquentme: yeah garann high five :D
17:57  garann: l4rk: redoing it to what end?
17:57  SugaSlide: garann's css-fu is greater than mine :(
17:57  l4rk: benlangfeld: in your gist you're creating two jquery objects
17:57  l4rk: and manually binding two events for no reason
17:57  l4rk: no good
17:57  benlangfeld: l4rk: What?
17:57  benlangfeld: l4rk: Two objects where?
17:57  garann: Jarda: i'm not surprised. cobbler's children, no shoes, etc..
17:57  l4rk: $(selector) ...
17:57  Jarda: garann: http://screencast.com/t/y85aOuEmEZL
17:57  l4rk: $(selector)...
17:58  l4rk: lines 5 and 6
17:58  benlangfeld: l4rk: Oh right, I didn't know that was creating anything. I do Ruby, not JS :P
17:58  sean`: hi garann
17:58  SugaSlide: lol shes famous :P
17:59  garann: Jarda: thanks! i actually knew about that issue. just need to *fix* it one of these days..
17:59  jomofcw: Jarda wtf is this :D ?
17:59  l4rk: garann: going to discuss creating a site with a backend first and then using postMessage to maintain state and bookmarkable url, and then fetching the template and context during the postMessage trigger
17:59  sean`: SugaSlide, she did  a preso on templating
17:59  SugaSlide: hmm
17:59  garann: hey sean`
17:59  l4rk: or something similar to that, ben is also doing a post and i want to overlap as little as possible
17:59  SugaSlide: yeah i recall
17:59  SugaSlide: was in my "to read" section :/
17:59  garann: l4rk: ooooh, that sounds very slick
17:59  JKarsrud: benlangfeld: Either cache your selector, or chaing your binds
18:00  benlangfeld: JKarsrud: So $(selector).click(...).keyup(...); ?
18:00  qq99: there a good way to remove all custom .css() applied by js indiscriminately?  like a plug-in adds a bunch of .css, I'd like to remove them all from the element
18:00  JKarsrud: benlangfeld: Correct
18:00  jomofcw: garann if I see a dev (frontend or not) which have only Apple "accessory", I can't work with him/her :x.
18:00  SugaSlide: something that amaizes me bout "techies" they always make such simple things seem so complex :/
18:00  benlangfeld: JKarsrud: Will remember that, thanks :)
18:01  jomofcw: I thinks you should change that :D
18:01  SugaSlide: half the time you read bout something that sounds amaizing and revolutionary
18:01  l4rk: jomofcw: why? that seems kind of racist
18:01  jomofcw: l4rk... probably :x. That's more a joke ;)
18:01  SugaSlide: and when you think bout it and cut the big words away its all "o ok but ive been doing that for ages"
18:01  l4rk: racism is not a joke
18:01  jomofcw: Anyway, I find the layout funny and original.
18:01  jomofcw: l4rk Apple is not a race
18:01  l4rk: it is a race of computers
18:02  jomofcw: it is a trademark....
18:02  jpic: hi all, how to figure why a <script></script> isn't interpreted when inserted into the dom through .html() ?
18:02  jomofcw: An iphone is not a computer :D
18:02  SugaSlide: jobsidians ARE a race
18:02  jomofcw: But nvm, that was a joke...
18:02  l4rk: and iphone has memory and a processor, how is a not a computer???
18:02  l4rk: and a logic board
18:02  jomofcw: l4rk it's up to U :)

18:03  jomofcw: But nvm, that was a joke wD And I find her work great :)
18:03  garann: jomofcw: the cartoon's just a joke, too :)
18:03  SugaSlide: and you probably wont ever get to work with ehr anyways :P
18:03  garann: thought sadly accurate ftm
18:04  jomofcw: garann and it's a funny one :)
18:04  jomofcw: garann I really love those ;)
18:04  jomofcw: SugaSlide probably :p
18:04  garann: jomofcw: thanks, yo :)
18:04  nbari: Hi all, I am usgin .ajax to post data to a php script the one just return true/false depending if successfully could save the data, but in jquery using the success: function(), how can i interact with this true/false?
18:05  l4rk: nbari: success is passed a parameter data
18:05  l4rk: are you just echoing out true or false?
18:05  SugaSlide: LOL
18:05  nbari: so the validation needs to be done inside the success riht ? since the error: is just called when the post failded
18:05  nbari: yes
18:05  l4rk: if so, could probably do something like success: function(status)
18:05  SugaSlide: garann http://gyazo.com/0f8792361c7b7b18a5707e36fbed1918.png :P
18:05  nbari: only echo $db->(query..)
18:05  jomofcw: nbari see for complete event too.
18:06  nbari: jomofcw how ?
18:06  jomofcw: nbari it work "lik" succces. Take a look at the doc to understand more how it work
18:06  jomofcw: ?ajax
18:06  bot-t: jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
18:06  SugaSlide: http://gyazo.com/31fbc7b66dcee347585eb9d32a7b6edc.png
18:06  nbari: ok
18:07  l4rk: yeah complete is usually a better callback to bind to
18:07  jomofcw: Have a nice evening !
18:07  johnline: i put a gif in the href, and now magically works
18:07  jomofcw: sure l4rk
18:07  johnline: stupit ie
18:07  nbari: complete(XMLHttpRequest, textStatus) this one right ?
18:07  jomofcw: nbari complete > call anyway success or error.
18:08  jomofcw: yep nbari
18:08  jomofcw: I have to go, so hope you could get it working :).
18:08  l4rk: nbari: complete: function(xhr, status) { xhr.responseText // would contain teh value }
18:08  nbari: so if I properly undestand I can use comple insatead of success
18:08  l4rk: rufo: how are your stairs doing?
18:09  nbari: ok let me try, thanks for the help
18:09  l4rk: nbari: yes complete triggers after success
18:09  l4rk: don't use both
18:09  rufo: l4rk: ?
18:11  SugaSlide: ok so since we got onto templating... any recomendations as to which 1 to use?
18:11  SugaSlide: im curently using the jQ 1... but it seems... under developed lol
18:12 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
18:12  garann: SugaSlide: what features do you need?
18:13  SugaSlide: general templating :/ like give it json.. build html lol.. what diferent features do templates offer?
18:13  SugaSlide: gonna go through your presentation so long
18:13  garann: they have varying levels of js/logic allowed within the template
18:14  garann: some will import from an external file, some you have to do it manually
18:14  l4rk: i like mustache
18:14  SugaSlide: the jQ 1 seems slow
18:14  SugaSlide: or is that just me?
18:14  garann: some have parsers for the backend so you can use the same template on the client and server..
18:15  Snerf: I have an img that is draggable, and I am trying to drag it into a div who's height is much more then the window, and I can only drag the item down so far, and then it won't allow me to drag further. Containment is 'document' Any help appreciated
18:15  garann: SugaSlide: are you caching your templates?
18:15  SugaSlide: hmm.. im busy with apps... basicaly access style things
18:15  SugaSlide: ye
18:15  SugaSlide: where it returns a shit load of records
18:15  SugaSlide: and builds buttons etc into the rows
18:16  SugaSlide: on like 20 records returned... using ajax and brining in the html seems faster
18:16 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
18:16  l4rk: SugaSlide: one thing to note is that mustache doesn't easily allow you to loop nested objects
18:16  l4rk: which is a huge limitation
18:17  SugaSlide: hmm so like loop through each record...
18:17  garann: l4rk: how do conditions work in mustache?
18:17  SugaSlide: and then inside the record it has an array
18:17  SugaSlide: ?
18:17  garann: can you use an expression or is it only {{if PropertyName}}?
18:17  Hopsy: hey SugaSlide
18:17  Hopsy: Trisox: gelukt?
18:17  Hopsy: k moest net weg
18:18  SugaSlide: jQ templ  {{each(i, result) records}} ?
18:18  SugaSlide: hi Hopsy
18:18  l4rk: garann: its more complicated than that iirc
18:18  SugaSlide: :D
18:18  l4rk: i think you need to use a named function
18:18  l4rk: sec lemme check docs
18:19  l4rk: Conditional sections begin with {{#condition}} and end with {{/condition}}. When condition evaluates to true, the section is rendered, otherwise the whole block will output nothing at all. condition may be a function returning true/false or a simple boolean.
18:19  Snerf: if you go to http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/scroll.html and try and drag the box further down the page, you will see it jump. Anyone have any ideas?
18:19  l4rk: kind of weak
18:19  l4rk: those conditions get passed into the view
18:19  SugaSlide: so {{ if this == that }} ... {{/if}}
18:19  SugaSlide: ?
18:20  l4rk: no
18:20  SugaSlide: thats the jQ tmpl thingy
18:20  l4rk: yeah i was showing mustache
18:21  SugaSlide: lol ye.. im just following with the tmpl thing to make sure we on the same page
18:21  SugaSlide: :P
18:21  SugaSlide: devs tend to use big words which go woosh over me
18:21  l4rk: problem with client side templates without fallbacks is that it becomes just as bad as flash someone doesn't have support, they see nothing
18:21  l4rk: terrible for SEO too
18:22  l4rk: you really do need that server rendered fallback to marriage the app
18:22  SugaSlide: im not too worried bout that.. since its intranet apps
18:22  garann: l4rk, agreed 100%
18:22  SugaSlide: and a big bad ass "use a browser and not that piece of shit" on login if they try using somehting that doesnt support
18:22  l4rk: garann: yeah thats what i was talking to you about at bocoup, until maybe a few weeks ago i wasn't convinced of any particular solution, but i think pushState really helps
18:23  garann: l4rk: nice, dude. i'm looking forward to this post. :)
18:23  l4rk: garann: do you use github, have you seen the new source browser there?
18:23  l4rk: thats all pushStatey and client side
18:23  garann: yes, and i don't think so
18:23  l4rk: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
18:23  l4rk: click on any of the files
18:23  garann: i mostly "use" it from the terminal
18:23  l4rk: it'll drill down without refreshing the page
18:24  l4rk: thats the sort of example i want to show people how to make
18:24  garann: hmm.. it's refreshing for me
18:24 --- mfer-food is now known as mfer
18:24  SugaSlide: same here
18:24  l4rk: :-p what hippie browser are you guys using!!
18:24  garann: webkit only?
18:24  l4rk: try it in chrome
18:25  l4rk: should be working in latest ffox too
18:25  SugaSlide: not working in opera 11
18:25  garann: ooooh, it's fancy!
18:25  SugaSlide: whoa
18:26  l4rk: yeah but imagine your entire site made that way :-p
18:26  SugaSlide: ... ok whos blogging how to do that?
18:26  garann: that would be great, provided you had a fallback
18:26  gnarf: ?gnarf
18:26  bot-t: a horrible stupid piece of shit (c) borris
18:26  gnarf: :)
18:26  garann: and were tracking the history
18:26  SugaSlide: at the moment... im uisng page.. and ajax to fill it with content.. no fallback
18:26  SugaSlide: gnarf <3
18:27  gnarf: mornin guys
18:27  l4rk: garann: yeah the goal is to build out the entire site without ajax first, and then add that in to enhance it
18:27  gnarf: (and gals if any of you are hiding)
18:27  garann: l4rk: that sounds lovely
18:27 * SugaSlide points to l4rk
18:27  garann: i've been trying to push for that at work
18:27  SugaSlide: ^_^
18:27  l4rk: garann: sooooooo important
18:27  garann: inorite
18:27  garann: sadly, i lost
18:28  garann: we're not even supposed to use js templates anymore :(
18:28  SugaSlide: whoa
18:28  SugaSlide: thats a bit rough
18:28  l4rk: jquery templates really need to get some ports out for other languages
18:29  l4rk: like php, python, ruby, etc
18:29  l4rk: so they can be references client/server
18:29  garann: besides php and .net?
18:29  garann: there's a php one
18:29  garann: i don't know how mature it is - don't use php - but it exists
18:30  l4rk: .net isn't relevant in my world
18:30  garann: lucky :)
18:30  l4rk: last three jobs i did asp.net and i'm done with it forever
18:30  SugaSlide: lol so what is relevant?
18:30  l4rk: stripped from the resume
18:31  SugaSlide: lol
18:31  gnarf: l4rk: thats how I build pretty much every site
18:31  gnarf: its not as hard as it sounds
18:31  l4rk: who said anything about hard?
18:32  l4rk: if you've ever worked with web forms and know anything about client side development, you want to shoot yourself
18:32  gnarf: well, it can be a pain when your co-workers start writting ajax shit before the non-ajax shit
18:32  garann: gnarf: do you have to work with .net mvc?
18:32  gnarf: like i'm pretty sure the "follow" links on this site i'm working on have no non-js way to acheive them :)
18:32  l4rk: asp.net mvc does seem to be the lesser evil
18:33  gnarf: garann: zend framework actually
18:33  garann: l4rk: until you get to the part about the backend having unmitigated control over the frontend, yeah..
18:33  l4rk: sshhhh microsoft knows best
18:33  SugaSlide: whats the diferencence between zend and normal php?
18:33  SugaSlide: spelling... fail
18:34  danheberden: SugaSlide: you get used to typing :: a lot with zend
18:34  SugaSlide: ok didnt know you could do nestled templates like that in tmpl...
18:35  danheberden: the php tmpl converted looks pretty good
18:35  SugaSlide: isnt it close to normal php?
18:35  jpic: hi all, if i want the values of inputs, selects and textareas of a form for use in $.post(), all i have to do is $('form.myform').serialize() ?
18:35  SugaSlide: ye
18:35  gnarf: SugaSlide: whats the difference between javascript and jquery?
18:35  SugaSlide: var data = $(this).serialize()
18:35  SugaSlide: o ok
18:35  jpic: SugaSlide: awesome trick!!! thanks
18:36  jpic: gnarf: javascript is faster ...
18:36  jpic: (if you mean "pure-javascript")
18:36  l4rk: ?g whats the difference between javascript and jquery @ gnarf
18:36  bot-t: gnarf, jQuery or JavaScript - JavaScript - Web development - http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1227063
18:36  danheberden: i didn't know jquery used un-pure javascript
18:36  SugaSlide: jpic $("#form1").submit(function(){ var d = $(this).serialize(); $.POST.... ; retur false });
18:36 * gnarf laughs
18:36  danheberden: maybe there is some secret javascript in there
18:37  danheberden: instead of "use strict"; jquery has "fuck pure"; ?
18:37  SugaSlide: lol.. well.. sorry wasnt sure what zend was
18:37  gnarf: zend framework is to php as jquery is to javascript....
18:37  SugaSlide: cool
18:37  l4rk: well is there is definitely a difference between $.each([], func) and [].forEach(func) danheberden
18:37  gnarf: that was the point i was trying to make :)
18:37  SugaSlide: php is suuch a baby language.. how can you simplify it more?
18:37  l4rk: -is
18:37  SugaSlide: jQ makes js smaller
18:37  SugaSlide: :P
18:38  gnarf: code size
18:38  ralphholzmann: SugaSlide: php is what you make out of it
18:38  gnarf: sure
18:38  danheberden: l4rk - was simply stating that jquery IS javascript :p
18:38  ralphholzmann: if you code like a baby, it will be a baby language
18:38  SugaSlide: and easier to read
18:38  l4rk: jquery is php
18:38  Brodingo: woah
18:38  Brodingo: COOL!
18:38  gnarf: danheberden: i think we all know that here...
18:38  gnarf: :)
18:38  danheberden: gnarf: uh, you'd be surpsied
18:38  danheberden: *surprised
18:38  gnarf: or rather, those of us participating in this conversation know that
18:39  danheberden: aye
18:39  SugaSlide: "can i use javascript inside the same script block as jQuery" comes up alot
18:39 * gnarf nods
18:39  gnarf: and I answer it a lt
18:39  SugaSlide: i let coldy answer it
18:39  SugaSlide: or aj
18:39  SugaSlide: :D
18:39  ajpiano: ?jsisjs
18:39  bot-t: When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
18:39  ajpiano: i got tired of typing it ;)
18:39  gnarf: nice
18:40  SugaSlide: your usual resposne... was nicer lol
18:40  gnarf: ajpiano: would someone get mad if i left that ?gnarf in bot-t? :)
18:40  SugaSlide: usualy made the person feel like calling gnarf a fool
18:40  SugaSlide: :P
18:40  ajpiano: gnarf, no it's ok
18:40  gnarf: awesome
18:40  SugaSlide: LOL
18:40  SugaSlide: hopsy has like a zillion bot-t factoids
18:41 * gnarf is proud of his strange stalker borris
18:41  SugaSlide: has he been back?
18:41  SugaSlide: what did you actualy do to him?
18:41  Krinkle: Hi, I'm using fadeIn() in combination with stop() and noticed that after a few clicks the fadeIn would only go half-way (the state it was when it was stopped)
18:41  Krinkle: So I thought I'd use fadeTo() instead
18:41  l4rk: Krinkle: stop(true, true) perhaps
18:41  SugaSlide: put the stop in the callback
18:41  SugaSlide: mebbe
18:41  Krinkle: Which works fine :)
18:42  Krinkle: But..
18:42  Krinkle: The problem is that the element (table row) stays visible.
18:42  Krinkle: although the contents hide
18:42  l4rk: Krinkle: Directly from the jQuery docs "To prevent such "strange" behaviours, use stop(true, true) to make jQuery properly finalize the animation with appropriate state."
18:42  gnarf: well, i didn't know how people felt about having vulgarities in bot-t... figured i'd dbl check
18:42  Krinkle: l4rk: I know, I have that already
18:42  l4rk: Krinkle: okay you didn't say that
18:42  armetiz: Hi there
18:42  SugaSlide: "how do they work" - like magic
18:42  l4rk: you just said Which works fine
18:43  Krinkle: l4rk: $tablerows.stop(true, true).fadeTo('fast',0);
18:43  l4rk: next time address me or something :)
18:43  Krinkle: $tablerows.stop(true, true).fadeTo('fast',1); // fadeIn
18:43  armetiz: I have a short problem.. $(function () { alert ("echo") ) } ) doesn't work..
18:43  l4rk: i thought you said you were using fadeIn and fadeOut
18:43  armetiz: I have no error into Console..
18:43  armetiz: I don't understand,
18:43  armetiz: any one have an issue ?
18:43  Krinkle: l4rk: It works in that it doesn't stop half-way, it finished the animation and doesn't only fade in to 50% of something
18:43  gnarf: armetiz: the extra )
18:43  Krinkle: but the tablerow itself stays visible, albeit the text inside is hidden.
18:44  SugaSlide: i dont think you can fade out a tr
18:44  Krinkle: I'll jsbin
18:44  gnarf: "function() { alert("echo"); }"
18:44  l4rk: Krinkle: i have no idea without seeing what you have
18:44  armetiz: gnarf I have write the code on Mirc, I have made a mistake into copy..
18:44  Krinkle: SugaSlide: Since jQuery 1.1.3
18:44  l4rk: I don't think thats a jquery specific thing Krinkle
18:44  Krinkle: slideToggle still doesn't work tho, but fade is fine
18:44  gnarf: armetiz: include jquery before you try to execute that code?
18:44  armetiz: Yeah..
18:44  SugaSlide: well .hide will do
18:44  SugaSlide: so mebbe...
18:45  armetiz: I have check it 3 times..
18:45  Krinkle: l4rk: If I use fadeIn() and fadeOut() it works perfect and hides the table row after fading
18:45  l4rk: okay so whats the ish with fadeIn and fadeOut then?
18:45  SugaSlide: but its gonna turn the text to transparent.. and the last moment.. the block will disapear
18:45  Krinkle: l4rk: but if I use stop and fadeTo() it says visible
18:45  l4rk: don't use fadeTo
18:45  armetiz: gnarf, the jQuery library seem to be old.. 1.2.6
18:45  armetiz: Let me do an update
18:45  armetiz: maybe..
18:46  gnarf: armetiz: even 1.2 should $(function() { alert('echo'); })
18:46  gnarf: ?jQuery(fn)
18:46  bot-t: jQuery(callback): Binds a function to be executed when the DOM has finished loading. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
18:46  gnarf: ?jQuery(fn)#sig
18:46  bot-t: jQuery( callback ) | Returns: jQuery | Added in v1.0. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
18:46  armetiz: gnarf ?JjQuery(fn) ?
18:46  Krinkle: l4rk: How else am I going to prevent this: Element is visible 100%, click-action, hides half-way and click again, fadeIn, fadeOut, click action again and fadeIn only goes to the point where the previous fadeIN was stopped.
18:46  armetiz: Do I have to check this code ?
18:46  SugaSlide: Krinkle maybe add a .data
18:47  l4rk: Krinkle: whats the issue with using fadeIn and fadeOut with stop(true, true)
18:47  gnarf: armetiz: nope '?' is bot-t --- was looking up the version that $( function ) was added
18:47  SugaSlide: with when the user clicks.. it reads the current state.. adds it to data
18:47  SugaSlide: then use fadeTo
18:47  Krinkle: l4rk: When the event is triggered while it animinates, teh next fadeIn() doesn't go to opacity:1 it only goes to the opacity when the prevoius stop was called
18:47  SugaSlide: or animate opacity
18:47  armetiz: gnarf, oh okay
18:47  Krinkle: l4rk: That is the problem with fadeIn/Out and stop(true, true)
18:47  Ely2: anybody interessted in a small job?
18:48  l4rk: Krinkle: can you prove that with some visible demo
18:48  l4rk: i don't believe you
18:48  l4rk: jsfiddle or such
18:48  SugaSlide: LOL
18:48 * gnarf agrees with l4rk 
18:49 * SugaSlide agrees with gnarf
18:49  armetiz: gnarf I have update to 1.4.4, and the problem persist..
18:49  gnarf: armetiz: see ?p
18:49  bot-t: armetiz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
18:49  gnarf: try fixee
18:49  gnarf: works better for straight block of html
18:50  armetiz: gnarf I don't understand "see ?p" ?
18:50  bot-t: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
18:50  gkatsev: no jsbin?
18:50  gnarf: reat the response that bot-t just gave you
18:50  armetiz: oh ok
18:50  armetiz: just pastbin it
18:50  armetiz: :p
18:50  gnarf: aye
18:50  SugaSlide: lol
18:50  armetiz: http://pastebin.com/0Dp5quGe
18:51  gnarf: alert('') will never show anything
18:51  gnarf: try putting something in there?
18:51  Krinkle: l4rk: Afaik it's a very known problem, but I'l jsbin :)
18:51  l4rk: its a known solution to use stop(true, true)
18:51  armetiz: gnarf, same thing
18:51  armetiz: (alert ('') show an alert box with a '' string..)
18:51  gnarf: armetiz: i need more, where is jquery included?
18:52  armetiz: You can see the full web page at : www.eptica.com
18:52  SugaSlide: alert("fupieceofshitcodejusteffingworkalready")
18:52  armetiz: jquery is load before this Javascript
18:52  gnarf: a: you include fancybox before jquery
18:52  armetiz: yes
18:53  SugaSlide: jQ first
18:53  armetiz: http://pastebin.com/iaaL8Hu4
18:53  gnarf: then re--include it
18:53  armetiz: I have update the pastebin
18:53  SugaSlide: css first.. then jQ then the other scripts
18:53  gnarf: you have like 2 versions of fancy box included
18:53  gnarf: nvm
18:53  gnarf: css
18:53  gnarf: sry
18:53  SugaSlide: noob :P
18:54  SugaSlide: im still waiting for that page to load
18:54  armetiz: hum.. CSS are load first..
18:54  armetiz: the I load jQuery
18:54  armetiz: then other kind of script
18:54 --- nbari is now known as nbari|away
18:54  gnarf: yeah, thats what I just said
18:54  armetiz: then, my custom script..
18:54  armetiz: that is not good ?
18:54  gnarf: apologized - misread the <link as <script in my sleepy eyedness
18:55  armetiz: ;)
18:55  Jarda: hey people. I was thinking of using jquery templates in a new project. What I am afraid of, though, is search engines
18:55  SugaSlide: armetiz call him names now
18:55  SugaSlide: he insulted you :P
18:55  Jarda: if I use these great templates, I will still have to provide static html (=duplicate view logic)?
18:55  SugaSlide: armetiz jQuery("form:not(.bouton_action_post)").parents("div.ajax").formulaire_dyn_ajax is not a function
18:55  gnarf: armetiz: random thing
18:55  gnarf: try removing the space before the ( in alert (
18:55  armetiz: gnarf, Alreayd do :p
18:56  armetiz: Thanks a lot dude ;)
18:56  garann: Jarda: if you want what you're templating indexed, yeah
18:56  armetiz: SugaSlide, I have seen it before..
18:56  garann: but if you're loading stuff with an xhr it's not getting indexed anyway, right?
18:56  Jarda: garann: ok, sucks. Then I'm better of with templating in PHP and updating contents with ajax (progressive enhancement)
18:56  SugaSlide: the ajaxcallback.jss runs before the "ready"
18:56  gnarf: aside from that -- it might be that your scripts are inside the <head> tag instead of the <body>, but I'm out of ideas
18:57  SugaSlide: so since its erroring out none of the js later in the dom will run
18:57  SugaSlide: scripts inside head arent a prob
18:57  SugaSlide: its just perfeormance
18:57  Jarda: I really was looking forward to use new client-side techniques. :(
18:57  garann: Jarda: the stuff that gets updated with ajax isn't getting indexed either way, right?
18:57  SugaSlide: his prob is line 308 of ajaxCallback.js
18:57  armetiz: ok SugaSlide.. I'll check this out
18:57  Jarda: garann: it is
18:57  garann: so for that part, you might as well use cs templates
18:58  SugaSlide: cs templates?
18:58  garann: client-side
18:58  Jarda: becaus I traditionally use <a href="foo/bar">Link</a>
18:58  SugaSlide: o ok
18:58  Jarda: but then just fetch that link with ajax
18:58  serio_: what up yall?
18:58  SugaSlide: theres no ways thats SEO
18:58  Jarda: but there is "static" content in the link address
18:58  garann: so you can do that same thing, you're just rendering it differently
18:58  SugaSlide: sup sup
18:58  armetiz: SugaSlide It work
18:58  armetiz: thank..
18:59  garann: how you render it doesn't impact what you put in your link
18:59  serio_: yay, Christmas time
18:59  serio_: imma get crunk
18:59  SugaSlide: Hopsy gonna ?cc it?
18:59  SugaSlide: lol
18:59  Jarda: garann: well, it kinda does for the stuff I need to loop through
18:59  SugaSlide: lucky you
18:59  Brodingo: crunkmas
18:59  Jarda: I need php loops for google and jquery template loops for browsers
18:59  Jarda: and it sucks
19:00  Jarda: so I most likely end up using just php loops
19:00  garann: ohh... the link you mentioned - is it returning html?
19:00  garann: not json?
19:00  Krinkle: l4rk: You're right. stop(true, true) worked. stop(true) not.
19:00  Jarda: garann: traditionally, yes
19:01  Krinkle: I didn't have the second true
19:01  garann: ah, i see
19:01  gnarf: armetiz: try jQuery(function....
19:01  l4rk: Krinkle: your welcome
19:01  gnarf: instead of $ ?
19:01  Krinkle: l4rk: http://jsbin.com/afogu5/edit
19:01  l4rk: No i don't need to see it, i'm glad you got it working
19:01  Krinkle: Bye
19:01  garann: Jarda: so yeah, if you switched to returning json, you'd lose the seo/dry value of returning html from the same link
19:01  serio_: merry crunkmas eberybawdy
19:02  garann: but you wouldn't be returning html :D
19:02  felixjet: hi
19:02  Jarda: garann: then I could use this new #! thing from google, but I still would need to duplicate view logic to serve static html for google crawler
19:02  Sahan: is there a way to select something inside an iframe?
19:02  Jarda: which just sucks. I hate to duplicate things
19:03  garann: Jarda: you could use a templating engine with a php parser?
19:03  gnarf: l4rk++
19:03  gnarf: ;)
19:03  garann: then you're just duplicating the code that renders the template
19:03  l4rk: Sahan: yes
19:03  l4rk: ?contents @ Sahan
19:03  bot-t: Sahan, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
19:03  felixjet: i have 3 images, lets say the image height is 600px, and and i have 3 images of 200px each there. i show 1 image and with a timer, i update the offset to modify the offset and show another image of the set
19:03  l4rk: look in that page it'll show you how to read from an iframe
19:03  felixjet: how i can do it animate?
19:03  serio_: I <3 beer
19:03  Jarda: garann: not that easy, IMO. To write a custom php parser for jquery templates..
19:03  felixjet: like a scroll ?
19:04  serio_: ?eval beer()
19:04  bot-t: serio_: ReferenceError: beer is not defined
19:04  Jarda: if there is one existing, then I could of course use it..
19:04 * serio_ is sad now
19:04  Jarda: but still, I was looking forward to do just pure data-backend + client side view
19:04  Jarda: so this sucks, big time
19:05  Jarda: stupid search engines without javascript :)
19:05  garann: Jarda: https://github.com/xyu/jquery-tmpl-php
19:06  garann: don't know how up-to-date that is, but it's a start?
19:06  Jarda: garann: ok, thanks. Will look it out. Still not the elegant solution I'm looking for :(
19:06  Jarda: to separate data from view completely
19:08  felixjet: i have 3 images, lets say the image height is 600px, and and i have 3 images of 200px each there. i show 1 image and with a timer i update the offset of the image to show another portion, but how i can do it animated?
19:09  Sahan: any recommendations on good jqueryfi ext for chrome ?
19:11  Brodingo: AH
19:11  timmywil: felixjet, need more info.  first thought is see ?animate
19:11  bot-t: felixjet, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
19:12  felixjet: ok, im gonna take a look

19:13  Hopsy: hey, does anyone have good experience with regex =[ ?
19:13  hariom: I have a modal window which opens on click of a link. When the window opens, I see that the main site focus gets dull and the modal windows gets focus. That is fine but when I close the window, I see that main site is still dull and I am not able to edit anything in there.
19:13  garann: hariom: sounds like when you open the modal, it adds a mask behind it, and you need to remove that when the modal's closed
19:14  ajpiano: closing the dialog should close the modal, if you're using the jquery ui dialog
19:14  hariom: garann: how to do that?
19:14  ajpiano: or any modal that doesn't completly suck
19:15  hariom: I have tried dhtmlmodalwindow and closing of it is not shifting the focus back to main site. But if I try the same windows on a page without jquery, it works fine
19:15  hariom: ajpiano
19:16  ajpiano: wtf is dhtmlmodalwindow

19:17  ajpiano: hariom, this is a piece of shit
19:17  ocf: lol
19:18  ocf: maybe you guys could lay it on a little more thickly. I'm not sure he's totally coated in shame quite yet
19:18  ocf: :-P
19:18  timmywil: hariom, if you MUST use that, and it works without jQuery, see ?noConflict
19:18  bot-t: hariom, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
19:18  ajpiano: whatever it takes
19:19  ocf: hariom - I think what they're trying to say is "golly gee, this is way more complicated than it needs to be. There are way better modal implementations that are a piece of cake" :)
19:19  Hopsy: humm
19:19  hariom: ajpiano: I am working on a lagacy site which has this working. I need to only take away parts which are not good these days. So I am making site good features like ajax and for that I am using jquery ajax. If dhtmlmodalwindow works for me then I don't have to link jquery ui lib as dhtmlmodalwindow is already linked on so many other pages.
19:19  Hopsy: isnt this regex valid? preg_replace('#\[img]^*{gif|png|jpeg}$[\/img]#si','',$postedmess);
19:19  ajpiano: say what you will ocf, i am literally trying to shame him into eliminating the use of such a crappy outdated modal
19:20  Hopsy: i want to change every image without an extension in nothing

19:22  ajpiano: another reason is that it's on dynamicdrive.com
19:22  ocf: lol l4rk
19:22  ajpiano: another reason is this documentation is woebegone
19:23  l4rk: hariom: point is that code sucks, its not going to work well and you have a problem, the solution is to not use that crap code

19:23  hariom: 14rk: I can't make a call based on your not so logical reasons as this is a production site and has many pages. What version it is on doesn't make sense and when it was updated doesn't make sense either. CentOS5.4 uses many old versions of the libraries but that doesn't make it a bad choice as a server.
19:24  l4rk: before i walk off i'll say your logic is flawed
19:24  l4rk: that old code isnt bad its just old, that code is bad
19:24  glen1: is it possible to use the animation function with background color?
19:24  l4rk: *that*

19:27  ajpiano: and show us the conflict
19:27  ajpiano: and perhaps we can determine why it is happening

19:33  ocf: if I knew the answer, I'd be a somebody :) never worked with mobile
19:33  Hoe``: There's no way to chain dialog events, correct?>
19:34  momesana: ocf: :-)
19:34  Hoe``: .dialog("close", function() { }); causes the old "close" function to be overwritten?
19:35  ajpiano: Hoe``. dialog("option","close",fn)
19:35  ajpiano: yeah, only one event though
19:35  Hoe``: :/
19:35  ajpiano: you could do bind though
19:35  Hoe``: oh?
19:35  ajpiano: then you probably could have more than one
19:35  glen1: you know the prepend function, is it possible to set a effect to that?
19:35  glen1: $('#info').prepend("<div>"+contentString+"</div>").effect("highlight", {}, 500);
19:35  ajpiano: .bind("dialogopen",fn)
19:36  Hoe``: glen: use prependTo
19:36  glen1: the effect higlights the "container" not the actuall div I want to highlight
19:36  Hoe``: so $("<div>"+contentString+"</div>").prependTo($("#info")).effect
19:36  glen1: thanks Hoe`` lol

20:01  timmywil: marcamillion, should that first line go back to grey?
20:01  ajpiano: peter2 http://jsfiddle.net/KUNha/2/
20:02  ajpiano: you have to use the callback, because ajax is asynchronous
20:02 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 104 seconds
20:03  marcamillion: timmywil: which first line ? the ones with the dashes ?
20:04  timmywil: yea
20:04  marcamillion: at the top ? beside the #1 ?
20:04  marcamillion: yes
20:04  marcamillion: if you click it through 4 times
20:04  marcamillion: what I want is, the first state
20:04  marcamillion: and the 4th state
20:04  marcamillion: everything else, in between is noise, that I don't want
20:04  peter2: is there another way to check if a file exists? i have a series of checks that set a variable to true or false, at the end if its true then submit the form.  i suppose i could write to a hidden input for this particular check instead
20:05  ajpiano: why would it be a "series of checks"
20:05  tchmnkyz-: hey guys
20:05  ajpiano: either it exists or it doesn't?
20:05  peter2: testing if a certain file exists is just one of the checks .
20:06  sean`: Vorspire, ping
20:07  ajpiano: so then your question isn't whether there is some better way to test if a file exists
20:07  ajpiano: it's how to do all those nested checks and then do someting at the end
20:07  Vorspire: sean` ping
20:07  sean`: Vorspire, opinion? http://blog.seankoole.com/private/nuhuoCDhkv
20:07  peter2: for example: if firstname is filled out, pass=true else pass=false.  if this photo filename is taken (file exists) pass = false, else pass = true
20:08  timmywil: marcamillion, i think you need to switch it from a toggle to a click and you keep track of when it should toggle.  As is, I think it's doing the second function when you want it to do the first again.
20:08  sean`: ?stats

20:09  marcamillion: u have an example of how that might look? because i had click first, but getting it to toggle wasn't working
20:09  ajpiano: s<a>hout out
20:09  sean`: ah thanks ajpiano
20:09  Snerf: using .draggable, I set the zIndex to 9999, but it is still under all the other elements outside of its div. containment is 'document'
20:10  sean`: lol @ progressisvme

20:13  veilig_abt: has anyone ever had problems showing a hidden label? ie: $label.show() ?
20:13  erichynds: nope
20:14  sean`: oke
20:15  marcamillion: sean` the video here: http://blog.seankoole.com/pages/about-3631 is hilarious
20:15  sean`: marcamillion, yeah

20:15  marcamillion: lol
20:16  sean`: thought we developers were out on the street making no money
20:16  sean`: :P
20:16  SugaSlide: normaly devs are sean as rich c***s lol
20:21  marcamillion: hey timmywil: can you pm me if you come up with something, or reply to that SO question....I have to go take a shower
20:21  marcamillion: thanks for your help

20:32  hariom: btw, $("<div />") will not select all divs? or it creates a new temporary div (that is what I want, a temporary div)
20:32  BrandonE: Hey. I'm trying to use http://jquerymobile.com/ to make my application (http://brandonevans.org/hanoi/) work when you click a tower. I can get it to work using the "tap" event, but it seems whenever I implement that, it overwrites the click event, regardless of what order they are in, breaking the version computers see. I'm wondering how I could get both of them to work. Can anyone help me?
20:33 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 107 seconds
20:33  gnarf: hariom: yes
20:33  gnarf: hariom: passing ANY html block into $() will turn it into DOM objects
20:34  gnarf: well any html block that has <> (a tag) inside it
20:34  hariom: gnarf: ok. so it creates a new dom object div
20:34  hariom: excellent
20:35  gnarf: hariom: yeah, but obviously, it returns a jQuery object containing that div, as opposed to the div itself
20:36  hariom: hmm... make sense
20:39  bradmaxs: hey all - I am doing a mysql find that can return a single row or array.  I then do a foreach loop and format the data like so $items['m'] = $chat['message'] and then send back with json_encode.  But I am getting an error from jquery: TypeError: Result of expression 'a' [undefined] is not an object.  the data is return like so: {"s":0,"f":null,"m":null} -> there are four records in the db - how can I debug json data since it is ajax? t
20:41  Jarda: bradmaxs: a) firebug b) show us the javascript code
20:41  hariom: I just did   $('<div />').load($(this).attr('href')).dialog({modal:true});  but I got an error saying "$('<div />').load($(this).attr('href')).dialog({modal:true});" is not a function
20:42  Jarda: you have the ui-library included?
20:42  hariom: I have jquery-ui-core and jquery-ui-widget included
20:43  bradmaxs: Jarda: http://jsfiddle.net/YW9kf/   here is the function I am working with. thanks
20:43  miketaylr: do you have jquery?
20:43  Jarda: hariom: include the whole jquery ui just..
20:43 --- ezra-g|brbbbq is now known as ezra-g
20:43  hariom: yea. I can see console.log and i Have other jquery function working fine
20:44  miketaylr: what's this there?
20:44  miketaylr: the div? O_o
20:44  hariom: I just fullfilled the dependencies mentioned here: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
20:45  hariom: btw, I have minified verisons
20:45  erichynds: hariom, if you're using the dialog widget you also need the dialog file..
20:45  hariom: I am not sure if I need uncompressed ones
20:45  hariom: ok
20:45  erichynds: use the download builder
20:46  erichynds: that's why it exists
20:46  timmywil: hariom, load will just return you an empty selection
20:46  hariom: ok
20:46  timmywil: put the dialog call in the success callback for load
20:46  Jarda: timmywil: no need
20:46  timmywil: why's that
20:46  Jarda: .load returns the div (jquery chaining, you now..)
20:46  timmywil: but it doesn't
20:46  BrandonE: Oh, it seems like I can't include jquery mobile on a non mobile version of the page. Is there anyway I can do that?
20:46  timmywil: i just checked
20:47  timmywil: ?source load
20:47  bot-t: Line#5585 - "load: function( url, params, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5585
20:47  Jarda: timmywil: of course it returns
20:47  bradmaxs: Jarda: I changed success: function(data) to uccess: function(items) as well as the .each statement and the error is gone but it still isn't sending back the rows?
20:47  djbokkeman: I got a input field for keywords. When input field contains"kaas" i would like to strong each "kaas" in a div. How can i do this ?
20:47  timmywil: it returns whatever you selected before the load, if you want the html that it loads, you have to put your code in the success
20:47  Jarda: timmywil: it returns the div, as I said
20:47  erichynds: i think he wants dialog() on the div he is creating, timmywil
20:48  timmywil: ah, ok
20:49  timmywil: except i hope he's attaching that div to the DOM at some point
20:49  ajpiano: Jarda, hariom, fwiw, i have always preferred this pattern
20:50  ajpiano: timmywil, you don't have to, if you have an off-dom div and call dialog it will append it
20:50  Jarda: timmywil: dialog injects it
20:50  bradmaxs: function(index, data) - when we do this - are we just setting up a key, value scenario?  so would this be the same function(i, data)?
20:50  timmywil: kk, never used dialog before
20:50  sean`: http://blog.seankoole.com/hawt-new-jquery-ui-effects read 'em and wheap 'em guys
20:50  ajpiano: hariom, Jarda: var foo = $("<div>");  foo.load("url.php",function(data) {  foo.dialog({close:function() { foo.dialog("destroy").remove();  });  })
20:50  ajpiano: this way you don't instantiate dialog until the ajax is don
20:50  ajpiano: you don't have redundant queries
20:51  ajpiano: and you don't get dialog pileup
20:52  hariom: so here it says I need core, widget and position for dialog to work: http://jqueryui.com/download
20:52  hariom: ok. will update the result.
20:52  miketaylr: awesome sean`
20:52  BrandonE: OK, it seems like I need to use a media query or something of the like to only include jquery mobile to my page. this doesn't seem to be working. can anyone help me?
20:53  Jarda: ajpiano: well, I usually do $('<div class="ajax-loading">.load('/foo/bar', function() { $(this).removeClass('ajax-loading'); }).dialog({close: function() { $(this).destroy(); }});
20:53  ajpiano: Jarda: yea, you just need the remove in there
20:54  sean`: ty mike
20:54  Jarda: ajpiano: true
20:54  Jarda: hariom: and of course you need the dialog-file itself
20:55  erichynds: nice sean`
20:55  Jarda: but it's usually a good idea to use the download tool (or just include the whole ui, the js itself isn't that big. It's the css that's massive)
20:55  sean`: :D
20:55  timmywil: word sean
20:55  Jarda: and the css-framework is 100% worth including
20:55  Jarda: otherwise you are using only like 20% of the power of jquery ui
20:57  ocf: hey sean` - fyi, .length and .size() are the same. idiot.
20:58  sean`: ocf, really?
20:58  sean`: wow, thanks
20:58  sean`: didn't know that :?
20:58  ocf: :)
20:58  Vorspire: hey ocf, chill, it's sean`s first day
20:59  ocf: I wasn't really paying attention who I was talking to when I was "informing" you

20:59  ocf: I mean, don't get an overly inflated ego or anything, but I'm pretty sure sean`++
20:59  felixjet: im trying to .animate() a background-Y
20:59  sean`: haha
20:59  sean`: ocf, for the record, I know .size () == .length :p
20:59  hariom: I have included the necessary ui files. I get a error in jquery.ui.dialog.min.js saying c.widget is not a function at line: 34
20:59  felixjet: and it doesnt work in firefox because FF doesnt have background-position-y
20:59  timmywil: .size() is for ugly smurfs
20:59  ocf: lol, I know
21:00  felixjet: and if i animate background-position with X + Y, it doesnt animate
21:00  ocf: you were correcting me earlier, cuz I said .length() and .size, not .length and .size()
21:00  felixjet: it jumps directly
21:00  felixjet: any idea?
21:00  sean`: ah
21:00  sean`: <3

21:01  Jarda: hariom: could you just download the with the service?
21:01  ajpiano: hariom, you probably haven't
21:01  ajpiano: cause you don't have the jquery.ui.core.js
21:01  ajpiano: i mean the jquery.ui.widget.js
21:01  hariom: I have downloaded full ui
21:02  ajpiano: you haven't included the widget factory, or at least not at the right time
21:02  hariom: and selectively linked the required ones in my page
21:02  hariom: Does order of inclusion matters here?
21:02  ajpiano: yes
21:02  ajpiano: it does
21:02  ajpiano: that is how dependencies work
21:02  hariom: ah!, ok. Let me check for that

21:03  ocf: D===8 - invert?
21:03  gkatsev: gnarf: lol
21:03  timmywil: felixjet, yea i forgot that positionY doesn't work in firefox.  you could make the background be a separate element and animate it's position
21:03  SugaSlide: garann use another port for it?
21:04  gkatsev: ##javascript has vbotjr which runs on node and it has the dicks module which is a port of the dicks gem.
21:04  timmywil: and no, it's not core
21:04  BrandonE: dick jokes? haha, so clever
21:04  felixjet: timmywil what do you mean?
21:04  garann: SugaSlide: i can use the web client if i really need to
21:05  felixjet: it needs to be a background, cant be an image
21:05  timmywil: attach the background to an element that sits behind whatever element you're trying to animate, put it inside a block element with overflow:hidden and animate it's top instead
21:05  SugaSlide: garann ye :P but i would suggest you try the other ports first.. web clients are ikky
21:05  vacho: how can I count how many occurances there is of: ngg-gallery-thumbnail
21:05  vacho: class of : ngg-gallery-thumbnail
21:06  felixjet: timmywil but thats not a background
21:06  felixjet: or i dont get you at all
21:06  timmywil: felixjet, it's not an img tag, you can still apply it with css
21:06  garann: SugaSlide: also blocked. but that wasn't really my point. :)
21:06  SugaSlide: vacho $(".ngg-gallery-thumbnail")/length
21:07  SugaSlide: .length
21:07  SugaSlide: garann you MUST be here more :P
21:07  felixjet: timmywil can you please give me some fake code on how it should look?
21:07  felixjet: like <div background-image><div your original div> etc
21:08  felixjet: dont need to work, but i will understand it better >.<
21:08  felixjet: not*
21:08  felixjet: by the way, the backgrounds are 3 which needs to rotate

21:16  ajpiano: what error message
21:16  Trim: basicly i join this channel because all the time i post accordion on my site it breaks jquery XD
21:17  hariom: ajpiano: There are some Math calculations going on for nevigation and that gives error that value is null.

I want to open multiple files in "tabs" would it be best to store the files data in a variable and sync with 1 div on the active file or just create multiple divs with the data for each and hide/show them?
21:18  hariom: Yea, I know. Finding a better way to communicate that error. Btw, is there any conflict between Lavalamp scripts and jquery?
21:20  Trim: so all my js was good, than i made this cycle update, than jquery and ui at last, after that js turned of, after some "first aid" moves i decided to remove funtions and check which one is f around with my, so each time i turn accordion on it happens
21:20  Trim: thats not funny ;p

22:16  ajpiano: li
22:17  BrandonE: ajpiano: Then something else is breaking my app.
22:17  soreau: ajpiano: But it takes two images for one item because of the fade effect
22:18  ajpiano: soreau: including two imagse in every menu item
22:18  ajpiano: to make a menu
22:18  ajpiano: is not really...what's the word...good
22:18  ajpiano: soreau, have yo ulooked up any resources on how to do this, or are you just flying by the seat of your pants
22:19  soreau: ajpiano: I am flying and reading too but no example or tutorial has relevant code that works
22:19 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
22:19  soreau: Right now I just want it to work
22:22  BrandonE: ajpiano: my application (http://brandonevans.org/hanoi/) is including jquery mobile, and when it seems to be screwing up my click binding for the towers.
22:22  BrandonE: if I remove it, it works fine, but doesn't work on the mobile phone obviously
22:23  MatthewG: BrandonE: someone it #mobile-webdev might know if you wanted to as there, fwiw, we mostly discuss jquery mobile
22:24  soreau: ajpiano: All's it does is break the fade effect http://jsfiddle.net/bzThs/11/
22:24  soreau: Not working like I need it to
22:24  ajpiano: soreau, chill your grill
22:24  soreau: ajpiano: My grill is chill, I just need some information
22:25  soreau: ajpiano: Can you point me to a buttons list tutorial that actually has working code? So far google has a whole lot of everything but not what I'm needing to know
22:25  ajpiano: one sec
22:26  soreau: I don't know, maybe I should be asking in #css
22:27  soreau: I think maybe the absolute css position values are throwing it off
22:27  ajpiano: soreau, they are
22:27  ajpiano: i am making something for you if you wait a min
22:28  soreau: Ok thank you
22:31  BrandonE: ajpiano: I've asked the same question in the channel MatthewG suggested, but it seems like no one's around to answer. You seem to know why this might be happening. when you get the chance, you think you can take a look?
22:31  ajpiano: i dont have a clue as to why it's happening :/
22:31  ajpiano: i just wanted to dispel you of the notion that jquery mobile only runs on mobile sites
22:33  ajpiano: soreau, the li positioning is really easy, i can show you that
22:34  ajpiano: i am trying to come up with an elegant way for the buttons to fade
22:34  ajpiano: but it's gross cause you have like....images as text
22:34  ajpiano: which is *so bad*
22:34  ajpiano: especially in a menu
22:35  ocf: disclaimer - I don't use images as text, but is a sprite.... *so bad* ?
22:35  soreau: ajpiano: Is there an easier way to create the fade effect?
22:36  ajpiano: much easier and graceful ways, do you want me to show you one
22:36  soreau: Sure
22:36  ajpiano: i am going to use jquery ui animate class methods
22:36  soreau: I am new to all of this code
22:36  soreau: I want to be able to write in a way that is easier to manipulate and use
22:36  BrandonE: ajpiano: but it's obvious the problem here is the inclusion of the file. I remove it, and it works. how could this not be related? Is it a version issue? v1.0a2 minified
22:37  ajpiano: BrandonE, your towers are draggable, are they not
22:37  ajpiano: and jquery moblie is an alpha product, is it not
22:37  ajpiano: wait, nm.
22:37  BrandonE: ajpiano: no. you click them to pop it off, click another tower to pop it on. This is used to illustrate solutions when you run a solver
22:38  ajpiano: ah
22:38  ajpiano: BrandonE, i would have to aggressively debug it to figure out what's happening
22:38  ajpiano: i can point you to where you should try looking if you want to do it yousrelf
22:38  ajpiano: but i can't myself
22:38  ajpiano: right now
22:39  ocf: probably something really stupid: http://www.kloudmash.com/mashwarelive/mesportsgrill/ - my 3 facebook divs below the header image.. anyone with fresh eyes able to tell me why the fk they won't float left?
22:39  BrandonE: ajpiano: I don't *want* to do it myself, but I'll assume that's my only option. That said, considering it seems that 100% of the problem is inside of the external library, I'm not sure how much I can do
22:39  BrandonE: but feel free to give some pointers as where I should be looking...
22:39  ajpiano: BrandonE, people find and solve bugs in jQuery, they do that by looking iniside of th library code
22:39  ajpiano: BrandonE, know how to use stack trace
22:39  ajpiano: ?
22:40  ajpiano: BrandonE, the exercise here is to learn how jquery assigns an event handlre
22:40  ajpiano: and dispatches the event
22:40  ajpiano: and then see how mobile is modifying it
22:40  ajpiano: BrandonE, before you go too crazy
22:40  ajpiano: you might want to try grabbing the latest jquery mobile from github
22:41  ajpiano: to see if the issue maybe went away

22:44  RideExile1: just looking for a little help... i think it should be easy. ha http://pastebin.com/4EuyLv6Y
22:45  RideExile1: Line 22 and 174 really, they would work untill i put them nested as the other's callback. Now they do nothing. Any ideas?
22:45  ocf: line 30 doesn't have an end-semi colon
22:45  ocf: nor does line 178
22:46  ocf: or 180
22:46  RideExile1: i thought if it was nested as a callback it didn't need it. It does?
22:46 * soreau patiently waits for ajpiano 
22:46  ocf: or 32
22:46  ocf: maybe it doesn't
22:46  RideExile1: ha i got ya.
22:46  RideExile1: i think your right. simple things.
22:46  gnarf: it doesn't "need"
22:46  gnarf: but its best to use
22:47  gnarf: always
22:47  gnarf: unless your golfing
22:47  ocf: so gnarf - you're saying I should use, except when golfing?
22:47  BrandonE: ajpiano: I have a better answer, and sorry in advance for not noticing this
22:47  ocf: why wouldn't you use, while golfing?
22:47  BrandonE: but I have 1.4.2 jquery
22:47  ajpiano: BrandonE: ah :)
22:48  gnarf: semi-colon is an extra character
22:48  gnarf: the whole point of golfing is to do it in the least amount of bytes
22:48  BrandonE: wait, ajpiano, still seems to be not working
22:49  RideExile1: Alright, so i added semi's but it still doesn't do what i intend. ha. I want  ul.subnavi to hide then ul.mainnav and then #concon.
22:49  gnarf: like --- draw a piano in 197 characters: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2202897/code-golf-piano/2203549#2203549
22:49  gnarf: can you do it in less? :)
22:50  RideExile1: impressive
22:50  BrandonE: ajpiano: another thing I noticed...if I remove the click event and I replace it with tap, it works a little on the desktop version, but not really. somtimes, it's counting the tap twice
22:50  ajpiano: BrandonE, like i said, alpha
22:50  gnarf: http://gnarf.net/golf2202897.html
22:50  BrandonE: ajpiano: and I think I know why that might be, too
22:51  RideExile1: cool script haha

22:52  ajpiano: soreau http://jsfiddle.net/bzThs/21/
22:53  RideExile1: i've never heard of code golf but it looks like fun ha
22:53  deafferret: hahah
22:53  BrandonE: ajpiano: this is definitely all my fault, but I'm not positive what I'm doing wrong. It seems I have it so that multiple events are being executed because I'm binding to overlapping elements
22:53  RideExile1: anyone have any ideas about my script though? I promise its gotta be a simple
22:54  ajpiano: soreau, that approach is much closer to how people actually write menus in 2010 in html
22:54  ajpiano: using css to style
22:54  ajpiano: and plain text for the text
22:55  soreau: ajpiano: That doesn't show how to use my custom images for button fade though
22:55  ajpiano: no, i
22:55  backinnam: The ui-effects-wrapper is not being removed after a hide('blind').  Is this expected?
22:55  ajpiano: it doesn't.
22:55  ajpiano: because having custom images for every menu entry
22:55  ajpiano: is bad
22:55  ajpiano: and i said that
22:55  ajpiano: i was going to show you a different
22:55  ajpiano: method of doing it
22:55  soreau: ajpiano: That doesn't really help me at all. I want images for every button
22:55  ajpiano: why
22:56  soreau: Because that is the style I want on my site
22:56  ajpiano: soreau, the part about using ul li with float:left display:block
22:56  ajpiano: still applis
22:56  ajpiano: so use that
22:56  soreau: ok

22:57  soreau: ajpiano: If there is an easier and/or better way to do this, let me know http://jsfiddle.net/bzThs/6/
22:57  BrandonE: ajpiano: Perhaps I should just start over here; the reason that right now it's executing that event multiple times is because I have some overlapping elements, all part of the "move" class, that are executed when you click / tap on them. The goal is to make it so that if you click anywhere in the area of a tower, it'll pop off a disk. Is there a better way to do this?
22:57  ajpiano: BrandonE, are those "move" classes children of each tower area?
22:58  BrandonE: ajpiano: All of the children of the tower area are part of the move class, yes
22:58  ajpiano: BrandonE, why not just bind the click event to the tower area then ?
22:59 --- kdrsx is now known as kuadrosx
22:59  BrandonE: ajpiano: It seems that it won't count if you're clicking blank space, even if it's part of the area

23:00  backinnam: anyone else had a problem with ui-effects-wrapper not being removed after effect is complete?
23:00  BrandonE: ajpiano: I think I know why
23:02  BrandonE: ajpiano: You were right, that works. OK, just to test it on a mobile device and we're set
23:03  soreau: ajpiano: I don't understand why you are saying don't use images as menu buttons - how would you achieve the same effect as this without doing that? http://jsfiddle.net/bzThs/6/
23:04  ajpiano: you could have the image cross fade, and the text on top of it
23:04  ajpiano: having the text as part of the image is "inaccessible"
23:04  soreau: ajpiano: How does that get me text reflection?
23:04  hdon: is there a jquery shortcut for selecting on textContent criteria? (i want to select buttons based on their label, but the label is not an attribute)
23:04  ajpiano: soreau when did you start making websites?
23:04  soreau: ajpiano: Last week
23:05  ajpiano: you should do some reading on the state of the industry and the purpose of the medium
23:05  hdon: or should i just .filter(function(){return this.textContent=='whatever'})
23:05  ajpiano: menus aren't supposed to look cool with awesome text reflection
23:05  ajpiano: they are supposed to actually have words in them
23:05  soreau: ajpiano: I really don't care about any standards if it says I can't have text reflection on my navigation menu buttons
23:05 * hdon lols
23:05  hdon: this is priceless
23:05  ajpiano: that have meaning when the html document is presented with out text or images
23:05  ajpiano: it's not standards
23:05  ajpiano: it's common sense
23:05  soreau: ajpiano: I want it to look cool and sleek
23:05  hdon: soreau, you might be happier with Adobe Flash Studio
23:05  ajpiano: i can't believe i just wasted 45 minutes talking to you
23:05  soreau: No common sense here, just art
23:06  soreau: expression
23:06 * hdon recommends Flash
23:06  hdon: i'm just going to use .filter() then...
23:06  hdon: oh wait... i already have a custom attribute for this...
23:07  soreau: I can't believe you're trying to tell me there's not a way to do what I want to do
23:07  ajpiano: there is
23:07  ajpiano: i'm not saying that at all
23:07  ajpiano: i am just saying that what you are trying to do
23:07  ajpiano: is not the point of a website

23:08  ajpiano: soreau, come back to me in 5 years when you actually take this seriously
23:08  ajpiano: or next week
23:08  soreau: ajpiano: Take what seriously?

23:09  soreau: What you are showing me looks like crap
23:09  ajpiano: the point was to show you the TECHNIQUE
23:09  soreau: Well your TECHNIQUE doesn't work for me
23:09  ajpiano: you can use css3 transitions and shit
23:09  ajpiano: to make really cool looking stuff

23:31  gnarf: if you want a more complex gradient, use a background-image

23:32  timmywil: To be fair, this is all a moot point tho if your site needs to work the same way in ie.  there are quite a few downsides to desandro's site as well.
23:32  nimbupani: soreau: you are harping on stuff that requires way more information to grasp. i would seriously recommend you go thro the Opera webdev curriculum first.
23:32  doonie1: any html5 guys around ;>
23:32  atula: I feel like this is exactly what you need: http://javaboutique.internet.com/Lake/
23:32  nimbupani: before you jump into designing shiny objects in CSS
23:32 --- doonie1 is now known as doonie
23:33  nimbupani: doonie: ask in #html5
23:33  soreau: gnarf: So you're saying just scratch the reflection because ultimately, it will be harder for people to read if their $SETUP isn't just like mine?
23:33  atula: perfect reflection all the time: http://javaboutique.internet.com/Lake/
23:33  doonie: will do
23:33  atula: if you make each menu item a java applet ... the reflection with be perfect.
23:33  nimbupani: ROFLZ
23:33  atula: I bet you can even do something like putting the flash in the applet... then reflect the flash
23:34  atula: but in the flash... have the hover make the reflection as well... so you'd have a reflection inside a reflection
23:34  atula: win win situation
23:34  danheberden: soreau: and fwiw, there's a lot of graphic designers in here along with strictly web dev peeps
23:34  gnarf: soreau: im saying scrap the text reflection it distracts the eye from actually reading the text
23:35  gnarf: also, using browser rendered text has the advantage of being more linkable/crawable by spiders
23:35  ajpiano: but it looks so cool
23:35  ajpiano: the people usng the website
23:35  ajpiano: will think it's really glass!
23:35  ajpiano: actually reflecting the text!!
23:36  soreau: gnarf: So just use html text with a font and use the button bg images without text? (and then I can still use the list for the fade/hover effect?)
23:36  ajpiano: gnarf, props for patience ;)
23:37  gnarf: soreau: yes ... and I would make the html only have the background image on the div, use jQuery to inject an absolute positioned think behind the actual text but in front of the background
23:37  gnarf: or rather "li" in this case
23:37  aziz: decl.find(">.symbol") works in 1.4.2 but not in 1.4.4. What gives??
23:37  gnarf: so then the structure reads nice: <ul class='menu'><li><a href="/">Home!</a></li></ul>
23:39  gnarf: $('.menu li').each(function() { var $item = $(this); var $b = $("<img>").attr('src', '....').css({position: 'absolute', top:0, left:0, zIndex: 10}).prepend($item); });
23:39  gnarf: and .menu li to define a width/height
23:39  gnarf: and .menu a to text-align center
23:39  gnarf: etc
23:40  gnarf: put your hover fade code in there somewhere
23:40  gnarf: etc
23:40  ajpiano: that's more or less what i was attemping here http://jsfiddle.net/bzThs/14/
23:40  gnarf: that approach allows the "lowly" web browsers (like google spiders, screen readers, blackberrys) to still navigate the site
23:41  ajpiano: why are those people allowed to look at my website at all if they won't see the cool effects though
23:41  gnarf: but, this is the advice you'll get from someone who has many years of doing it the wrong way too
23:41  gnarf: :)

23:42  gnarf: HTML/CSS is only as complicated as you want to make it
23:42  ajpiano: soreau, also, if oyu are just learning stuff now, there is no drawback to experimenting witht the latest techniques, using css3 and stuff
23:42  ajpiano: as opposed to trying to just do it the same old way that people knew was bad 10 yrs ago but still "gives the right effect" if you are wiling to compromise on all the things we are talking about
23:42  gnarf: personally --- i just use .ui-state-default and .ui-state-hover, no "transitional" or "fade" effect
