13:07  philk_: totels: thanks!
13:09  totels: farhad2010: get a browser(or plugin) that lets you edit the page in-place, I know there are several plugins for firefox that allow you to do that
13:09 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 131 seconds
13:16  JKarsrud: farhad2010: Disable JS?
13:16  farhad2010: no .just change it in order to bypass some validation
13:17  JKarsrud: ahh, okay. Then do some stuff in firebug or something :)
13:18  JKarsrud: Change the id of the fields you want to bypass, if that's what the validation uses
13:18  farhad2010: Jkarsrud:firebug dont let to change javascript!u can test it
13:19  JKarsrud: farhad2010: I know, that's why I said you can change the id's of the fields in the markup
13:19  igors: hi.. is there any way to use live() to do something when an element is added to DOM?
13:23  e-anima: [12:54] <ravenzz> e-anima http://jsfiddle.net/KMdHk/  , yes using an ewer jq version fixes that i know
13:24  Imaginativeone: what's the best jquery tutorial site?
13:25  aro: is there a way to pass parameters to a bound function?
13:26  Imaginativeone: what's a bound function?
13:26  aro: well a bound element rather
13:27  aro: say i have $(element).click(function() { }); - if a certain element is clicked, id like to pass an extra parameter to that
13:27  aro: in lieu of creating a separate binding for it
13:28  Imaginativeone: ah
13:28  jomofcw: Someone knows any issue about loading facebook JS SDK in a page where jQuery already loading ? It seems that make jQuery "crash"...
13:28  aro: jomofcw: not for me
13:30  jomofcw: aro hi :)
13:30  aro: hai
13:30  jomofcw: You load it asynchroneous ?
13:30  aro: yeah
13:30  jomofcw: Hm that should be the good way to do it... I try
13:30  aro: www.anx.com/blog for an example
13:31  jomofcw: thanks aro
13:31  aro: np
13:31  jomofcw: aro what you use to compress your JS ,
13:31  jomofcw: ?
13:32  aro: i use a component i modified for our php framework
13:32  aro: but, let me find the exact file
13:32  aro: http://code.google.com/p/jsmin-php/
13:32  aro: good stuff
13:33  crab: jomofcw: i've been using yuicompressor and the google closure compiler. both are good. but jsmin is oh-so-much smaller
13:33  crab: (jsmin.c, that is. i don't know about this jsmin-php.)
13:34  aro: just a port of jsmin.c
13:34  aro: its very lightweight
13:34  aro: yuicompressor is slooww
13:34  aro: mine actually generates cache files on my server when one of my js/css files is updated and serves that instead of regenerating every time
13:34  jomofcw: Thans aro :)
13:34  aro: np
13:35  jomofcw: aro hope I could integrate it as well in my php framework ^^
13:35  aro: what framework are you using
13:37  mokush: any idea when the jquery mobile beta will be dropping?
13:41  jomofcw: mokush > http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-mobile-roadmap

13:45  aef: hi, is there a very nice table plugin somewhere for server generated soted and paginated json content, including a ful text filter?
13:45  jomofcw: Not really a jQ question but I can't get an answer ... anyone have already done a facebook login in an iframe ?
13:48  aro: aef check google :)
13:49  Wiz_KeeD: greetings everyone
13:49 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
13:49  Wiz_KeeD: can someone please tell me if there is a possible version of the datepicker in windows mobile devices?
13:50  Wiz_KeeD: i have noticed that javascript is enabled but it clearly doesn't support the heavy-weight framework of jquery and jquery-ui datepicker
13:50  Wiz_KeeD: is there anyone workaround or special version? because from my googleing quest i have yet to find one
13:50  Wiz_KeeD: help would be apreciated
13:51  aef: aro: that is a really useless answer, as i did this for 2 hours and everthing i found hasn't had all the features i were looking for. for example, datatables is client side sorted, not usefull for my amount of data. flexigrid doesnt seem to have filtering capabilities
13:51  totels: jomofcw: it can be done, but you can't pass data from the iframe to your parent window due to cross-domain restrictions, so you will have to do a normal auth flow from your server to fb oauth and back and set up a timeout on your parent page to keep checking for auth data
13:54  Wiz_KeeD: does anyone have a suggestion regarding my problem?
13:55  hernyavila: Hi,  I need help to change the >>HTML code of a input value<< using jquery
13:55 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
13:55  jomofcw: totels thanks ! but actually doing it with the PHP SDK it ask me for a session key oO
13:57  hernyavila: Hi,  I need help to change the >>HTML code of a input value<< using jquery
13:58  Cork: hernyavila: the html code? you mean its attributes?
13:59  hernyavila: yeaph. the atribute value in HTML. it change in view but not in HTML
13:59  Wiz_KeeD: so no one is specialised in this area?
13:59  hernyavila: Cork: my jquery code change the value, the browser show the value but nothing changes in HTML
14:00  totels: Wiz_KeeD: I think most people resolve to use a simple dropdown for dates when they can't rely on a datepicker since dates are a limited set of values that are entirely predictable
14:00 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:00  Cork: hernyavila: what is it your trying to do?
14:00  Wiz_KeeD: are you reffering strictly to the mobile version totels?
14:00  totels: yes
14:01  Wiz_KeeD: even a simple unstyled datepicker would have been wonderfull and practical
14:01  Wiz_KeeD: rather than 3 dropdown
14:01  Wiz_KeeD: using you're pen si carefully select each of the 3 values
14:01  totels: try this: http://cubiq.org/spinning-wheel-on-webkit-for-iphone-ipod-touch
14:01  Wiz_KeeD: instead of having just one big calendar to pick from
14:01  totels: emulates iphone native date-picker
14:07  Wiz_KeeD: hmm doesn't seem to run
14:07  Wiz_KeeD: on my windows mobile
14:10  Wiz_KeeD: sorry
14:10  Wiz_KeeD: as i said that doesn't work on either my browser or windows mobile
14:11  kasad: question, how to call functions contained within iframe from parent window?
14:11  PointMan: I have a  if($(".status_processing").length > 0) { alert("hello world")}; I have a loop so I get a alert as long as there are status_processing nodes, however when I remove them using ajax the alert still pops up...
14:12  hernyavila: Cork: I have several intups (sub-total), each with a value. these values are calculated dynamically by jquery. I need to send these values to PHP and save the bank.
14:13  hernyavila: Cork: but after the jquery change the value, the HTML do not changes, so I will not be able to send it to Data Base
14:14  Cork: hernyavila: the html is used to create the dom the browser uses, the html isn't really used after that
14:15  Cork: ?p @ hernyavila
14:15  bot-t: hernyavila, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
14:16  Wiz_KeeD: any other suggestions totels ?
14:20  hernyavila: Cork: I'm using the Firefox inspect to see the Code. so, no matter if the HTML do not change. I will can send the input value in a for POST ?
14:21  Cork: hernyavila: if you want to get the changes from the client to the server you need to do a form or ajax post/get/similar ya
14:22  hernyavila: Cork: Thanks a lot Guy!!!
14:27  pea[0]: i'm using show() to unhide a div that has an animated background image but sometimes the image isn't shown. I'm not 100% sure but i think when i add the image in an image tag it always also loads the div animation. does that sound right, why is it doing that?
14:31  JuJuBee: How do I prevent a validation on a form if I press cancel?  http://pastie.org/1344381
14:33 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
14:36  prs: Hi all.
14:38  prs: I have an html file: div#foo>div+div+div#foobar>form And I would like to add another div before div#foobar. How can i achive this?
14:39  nbari: Hi all, is there a way to force the tab of a browser to be shown or to make the current page on top of the rest for warning about a session to expire ?
14:39  JoelE: How can I track if a "B" key was pressed?
14:39  Cork: prs: $('#foobar').before($('<div/>'));
14:39  prs: Cork: oh. Thx.
14:40  Cork: nbari: if you mean change tab in the browser tab bar, no you can't
14:42  nbari: I want to warn the user before closing their session, currently I display a dialog saying ( logout  or keep working) but in case the user open multiple tabs how can i alert them
14:54  JuJuBee: If I attach validationEngine ($("#user_info").validationEngine();) to a form, how can I remove it if user cancels the form so the validation doesn't happen?
14:56  Wyrmskull: im really new to jquery
14:56  Wyrmskull: i dont know how to handle the callbacks, i mean i have callbacks in callbacks in callbacks they get nested to infinity
14:56  JoelE: Is there anyway I can know after keypress() event if a Ctrl + "b" key combintion were preesed?
14:57  anli_: If I run .autocomplete a second time on a <input type="text">, will the previous autocomplete be cleaned up first?
14:57  anli_: And forgotten
15:01 --- nbari is now known as nbari|away
15:02  unfo-: JoelE, yeah. b is the key but there is a CTRL MODIFIER present if you press CTRL-b
15:06  anli_: I want to be able to click on a autocomplete textbox and get a list of all values
15:06  anli_: Can I do that by using box.click(box.change) or something
15:06  PointMan: I have a  if($(".status_processing").length > 0) { alert("hello world")}; I have a loop so I get a alert as long as there are status_processing nodes, however when I remove them using ajax the alert still pops up...
15:06  unfo-: JoelE, http://api.jquery.com/keydown/
15:06  timing_: hy guys, it seems like my javascript gets executed first, and then my browser adds the background images to the div's
15:07  timing_: can this be the otherway around?
15:07 --- timing_ is now known as timing
15:07  unfo-: JoelE, press ctrl-b in that input and check the output below and find 'ctrlKey'
15:10  PointMan: if I change the DOM (number of div nodes) using AJAX, why doesnt my if($(".foo").length > 0) pick it up?
15:12  PointMan: woaw, not a lot of help here when temp01 isnt active ;-)
15:12  freedgy: PointMan: check out .live()
15:12 * temp01 activates
15:13  PointMan: freedgy: ok thanks
15:13  PointMan: temp01: you robot! A good one none the less :)
15:13  anli_: What event is called when the user enters a input type=text?
15:13  anli_: .click seems to not be it
15:16  Rovanion: Is there any way I can iterate trough all the items, in my case divs with specific #id's, in a .class? Something like for( item in $('.hidden')).
15:16  PointMan: freedgy: Ive looked at http://api.jquery.com/live/ but domChange isnt a valid event to listen for?
15:17  unfo-: anli_, focus
15:17  anli_: Aha
15:18  anli_: Is there a way to force an autocomplete then? :)
15:18  anli_: I tried to use .autocomplete('search', '');
15:21  dub54: hey, how do I stop myFunc from all running at the same time, and have my code wait until the first myFunc is finished? http://pastebin.com/L6W76wL1
15:22  dub54: at the moment it runs myFunc() all at the same time because of the each, I want to wait until each myFunc is finished processing before the next starts
15:22  freedgy: dub54: check out .delay()
15:23  dub54: freedgy: how would that work? since I don't know how long myFunc takes to run
15:23  anli_: Seems that autocomplete only occurs when the user enters text in the textbox, no way to make this happen programmatically :)
15:23  PointMan: no event is triggered when the is changed freedgy, so how can I use live?
15:25  Rovanion: Is there any way I can iterate trough all the items, in my case divs with specific #id's, in a .class? Something like for(var item in $('.hidden')).
15:25  JuJuBee: How do I prevent a validation on a form if I press cancel? my js is : http://pastie.org/1344381
15:28  anli_: Rovanion: you can use the .each method
15:29  Rovanion: anli_: I will look into it
15:29  anli_: $(selector).each(function() { /* $(this) refers to the element */ });
15:30  Rovanion: anli_: Thank you!
15:32  anli_: If someone has bound "keydown.autocomplete" with bind to an element, how can I call that function?
15:32  anli_: There is an event I need to send, right
15:35  tprice: can anyone tell me why this does not work http://jsfiddle.net/UPwZs/
15:35  freedgy: PointMan: check out the comments on that page.. you may need to use .queue() also
15:35  tprice: it should loop through the divs and change the color
15:36  freedgy: tprice .children().length() ?
15:36  diamonds: hey why do I get "too much recursion" here? http://jsfiddle.net/A7FL2/
15:36  dub54: tprice there's a few syntax errors aswell
15:37  tprice: it onlt does the first 4
15:37  hariom: How to find the list of selected checkbox values? I have tried $("input[type='checkbox']['checked']").each(function(){ ... } ) but it doesn't seem to work.
15:37  JoelE: Is there anyway I can set a cursor to a certain location inside a TEXTAREA?
15:37  mekwall: anyone know of a nice jquery ui styled error tooltip for forms?
15:38  dub54: hariom: I think it'd be attr('checked', 'checked')
15:38  diamonds: hariom: input:checked? http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
15:38  anli_: diamonds: you call openshut from openshut
15:38  diamonds: anli_: yeah, recursion. but it's in a callback
15:39  anli_: I think you should skip ()
15:39  diamonds: anli_: what mean?
15:39  anli_: just openshut, not openshut()
15:39  diamonds: lolol removing the parens did it!!!!
15:39  anli_: nice
15:39  diamonds: ty anli_ !
15:39  anli_: :)
15:39  PointMan: freedgy: um talking to me? the word queue isnt even mentioned on http://api.jquery.com/live/
15:40  diamonds: is funny now... http://jsfiddle.net/A7FL2/1/
15:40  diamonds: very useful :)
15:40  Brodingo: holler
15:40  diamonds: not really I just wanted to take a crack at recursion... don't use it very much
15:40  anli_: This will actually not be recursion in normal sense
15:41  freedgy: PointMan: oops :) Meant for dub54
15:41  tprice: any idea whats going on?
15:41  diamonds: anli_: oh yeah.... I guess because it's just a callback it's not running "inside" the other function
15:41  dub54: freedgy: looked into queue but still running all at once
15:41  anli_: true diamonds
15:41  PointMan: freedgy: well I still need help trying to figure out how to listen for dom changes please
15:42  PointMan: freedgy: live needs an event, but dom changes does not trigger events
15:44  PointMan: freedgy: if only i could do node.change(handler) and the handler would be called if the subtree is changed
15:45  PointMan: temp01: do you have a solution for this?
15:45  freedgy: PointMan, ahh I see what you're trying to do now.. this might help: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/live-listen-to-the-event-create
15:46  freedgy: ..or something along those lines
15:47  freedgy: dub54: you can use .queue() to fire your functions one after another.. sounds like what you're looking for
15:47  dub54: freedgy: yeah think I was using it wrong, found something on stackoverflow that does the same thing but it's confusing me atm lol
15:50  freedgy: dub54: you may not even need .queue() if you did something like $('.foo').funcOne().funcTwo()
15:50  serio: is this the best way to do something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/serio/uGFnf/
15:50  dub54: freedgy: the amount of times the func is run is dependant on the user so i think queue is the way to go
15:52  freedgy: Looks cool serio.. don't know how else you would do that.. looks fairly efficient
15:54  serio: I was checking the microsoft windows phone 7 page, which is silverlight
15:54  serio: but like
15:54  serio: it could all be JS
15:55  serio: with this kinda chaining
15:56  freedgy: silverlight will be short lived

16:56  Prometheus: Boohemian: why not use an existing plugin?
16:56  Prometheus: granted, you'd still have to handle the CSS yourself..
16:57  Boohemian: well, i saw lots of tutorials out there... i've been trying to get this damn slideshow working for DAYS - it's fucking terrible. it's been one problem after another. i finally just got it set up (on my 50th try)
16:57  Boohemian: it was something SO stupid, that i didn't get it
16:58  elb0w: Boohemian, quick and dirty http://pastie.org/1344755
16:58  Boohemian: elb0w: thanks ! now, how do i figure out where i store this js file?
16:58  elb0w: what?
16:59  elb0w: oh lord
16:59  Boohemian: doesn't that style sheet need to go somewhere?
16:59  elb0w: What style sheet, I didnt give you one
17:01  amh345: anyone? bueller?
17:01  Boohemian: elb0w: what is that file then?
17:01  robgleeson-nb: amh345: it's just JS.
17:01  elb0w: that is the javascript
17:01  elb0w: and the html
17:01  Prometheus: Boohemian: in the future, I would suggest looking for help earlier rather than later ;)
17:01  Prometheus: it's something I've picked up along the years =P
17:01  amh345: ok, thanks robgleenson
17:02  elb0w: Here boohemian let me make it easier
17:02  elb0w: sec
17:02  robgleeson-nb: yw
17:02  elb0w: http://pastie.org/1344773
17:02  elb0w: just save it as an html page
17:02  elb0w: the code
17:03  elb0w: not the whole webpage
17:03  elb0w: and edit the /path/to/img.png to your website path to the image

17:26  jeremyw: I hate to reask a question but I never got a response and Googling didn't result in a satisfactory finding.
17:26 @snover: Hi eir!
17:26  jeremyw: I need a good breadcrumb plugin.  I tried xBookmarks but I wasn't too happy with it.  Does anyone know of a good breadcrumb plugin?
17:26  jeremyw: s/good/preferred/
17:28  JRGould: jeremyw: not familiar with any breadcrumb plugins for jQuery - I tend to execute stuff like that on the server-side. how would you envision something like that working? do you just want it to create a breadcrumb based on the url structure?
17:30  jeremyw: JRGould: Actually, I'd be happy with it taking an unordered list and fancifying it into a breadcrumb.  ;)  I don't mind doing this myself actually, so that's my next route.
17:30  Prometheus: jeremyw: isn't that just a matter of CSS?
17:30  jeremyw: xBreadcrumbs did just that but it didn't honor jquery UI's themes.
17:31  jeremyw: Prometheus: It is but I've learned to try a plugin before doing most things myself in the UI nowadays.
17:31  JRGould: yeah jeremyw that's a horrible way to do things
17:31  jeremyw: But yes, that's my plan.  I'll probably write my own.
17:31  Prometheus: jeremyw: but I don't see how a plugin would create a breadcrumb for you
17:31  jeremyw: What's terrible?  Reinventing the wheel or trying to see if there's a plugin?
17:31  JRGould: when you just need about 8 lines of css - there's no need to use a 200 line plugin
17:31  Prometheus: ^
17:32 --- gkatsev_ is now known as gkatsev
17:32  jeremyw: Prometheus: There are plugins for this, one that does it automatically, based on clicks, and another based on a ul in the page.
17:32  linelevel: I'm binding a click even like so:      $('a.myClass').click(function() {   foo(); return false;  });      In every browser I've tested other than Chrome, the 'return false' stops the <a> link from following its default href location.  But in Google Chrome foo() is run and then it follows the href link. Is this a known issue?
17:32  jeremyw: It's not so far fetched if people have already done it.
17:32  Prometheus: jeremyw: surely you need to generate the breadcrumb on the server side?
17:32  Prometheus: rather, the data for it
17:32  JRGould: ?preventDefault @ linelevel
17:32  bot-t: linelevel, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
17:32  Prometheus: or does the plugin magically know that
17:32  jeremyw: Prometheus: Yes, I'm generating a ul already and using CSS to do this.  I know how to create a breadcrumb, and have been doing it.
17:33  jeremyw: Prometheus: One of the plugins actually did it for you.
17:33  linelevel: JRGould: But   return false;  should not only prevent default but also stop propagation.
17:33  Prometheus: I don't understand, but okay
17:33  JRGould: linelevel: fiddle?
17:33  linelevel: fiddlesticks!
17:33  Prometheus: jeremyw: I guess I'm not understanding what you mean by breadcrumb
17:34  JRGould: haha - http://jsfiddle.net
17:34  jeremyw: Prometheus: Don't try to understand it, just try it: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/breadcrumbs  The first will create the breadcrumb for you, hard to believe but true.
17:34  jeremyw: Lesson learned, don't use a plugin for something that's CSS.  Got it.
17:35  JRGould: jeremyw: if i can use an analogy - don't use an axe to hammer in a nail
17:35  Prometheus: jeremyw: are you doing a single page web app?
17:35  JRGould: it'll work, but it's overkill
17:35  JRGould: and you might hurt yourself
17:35  Prometheus: if that's the case, I would understand why you would use a breadcrumb plugin..
17:35  jeremyw: Well, the lesson was to not ask about it.  Apparently others have had the notion to write a plugin for it so thinking there could be one couldn't be too far fetched.  ;)
17:35  jeremyw: JRGould: Yeah.  I have the traditional way working already.
17:36  dub54: need a jquery dev with experience using queue to queue custom functions, msg me, will pay, shouldn't take too long.
17:36  Prometheus: jeremyw: not to mention, if you create them via jQuery, then javascript disabled clients can't make use of it
17:36  Prometheus: :)
17:36  Prometheus: unless you are replacing your server-side generated one with a jQuery one
17:36  Prometheus: which doesn't make any sense..
17:37  JRGould: jeremyw: maybe we're misunderstanding you? if you have a breadcrumb implementation that works - then what do you need jq for?
17:38  Prometheus: the xBreadcrumbs just seems to offer enhancements on to your breadcrumb
17:38  Prometheus: but it's still generated somewhere else
17:38  wrtpeeps: hi chaps, trying to get an image to fade out. I have an img tag with the id attribute set to "bannerimg". I have a setInterval that calls a function every 8 seconds to change the banner's image (by setting the src attribute). THe image changes fine. The first line of that method is $('#bannerimg').hide("fade", {}, 1000);  , however the image doesn't fade out. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
17:38  jeremyw: JRGould: I just wanted to see if I could use a plugin to do more with jQuery and less by myself.  ;)  Just an experiment of sorts.
17:39  l4rk: i amnot a chap
17:39  JRGould: haha - well, the answer is 'yes' to that - but I always tack on "but should you?" ;)

17:43  JRGould: Wyrmskull: ??

17:45  Wyrmskull: http://jsfiddle.net/82rzN/
17:45  pigdude: where el and attr are the same
17:45  pigdude: in each
17:45  JRGould: pigdude: ahh - hmm - off the top of my head I don't know of anything
17:45  Wyrmskull: why does the page in the last "get" get loaded and the alert doesnt work?
17:45  Wyrmskull: the callback doesnt start
17:46  Wyrmskull: and there is no error in the firebug console
17:46  queso: Is there a way to prevent the autocomplete widget from closing when an item is selected?
17:46  pigdude: JRGould: yea, it doesn't appear to support alternation...might just gather the elements manually then

17:49  enapupe:   $("#files ul.images li :not('.more'").live("mo
17:49  kvnn: Wyrmskull : how about the php ?
17:50  kvnn: enapupe : Yea, you could do that. The docs say its usually better not to
17:50  JRGould: Wyrmskull: as long as the var name you pass to the function isn't a reserved word that shouldn't have anything to do with it
17:50  enapupe: wich is the best kvnn ?
17:50  JRGould: you should use firebug or the like to see what's going on with the xhr
17:50  kvnn: enapupe : according to docs, your original selector. nothing wrong with it
17:50  Wyrmskull: kvnn: just returns a json with a filelist array
17:51 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
17:51  kvnn: enapupe : actually, possibly the second one, because there is no 'find' there; i don't know implications of 'find' versus continuing your selector
17:51  kvnn: i.e. i'm not qualified to answer
17:51  kvnn: Wyrmskull : I think thats your issue, though. Data not returning properly, so JS doesn't know to finish.
17:52  kvnn: thats usually what happens to me
17:52  Wyrmskull: kvnn: not really, if i put "alert(1)" instead of "function(){alert(1);}" it works.
17:53  kvnn: Wyrmskull : Oh.

17:53  Lampoon: eTiger13 was last seen in #jquery-dev 15 hours 45 min ago saying 'although my site is much better'.

17:53  Wyrmskull: kvnn: what do you mean
17:54  enapupe: one mousedown bind replaces another mousedown?
17:54  kvnn: Wyrmskull : try blanking that argument
17:54  kvnn: enapupe : yeah. You can name your bindings
17:54  kvnn: enapupe : actually, i think they combine
17:54  enapupe: but replace is just the idea
17:55  kvnn: enapupe : .unbind().bind(...
17:55  kvnn: that will clear the bindings for you
17:55  Wyrmskull: kvnn: function(){alert(1);} doesn't work either
17:55  kvnn: so $('a').unbind.mouseDown(function(){alert("HI!"});;
17:56  kvnn: Wyrmskull : okay, so no function works in there
17:56  kvnn: but js will, i'm almost certain its an issue on the php side
17:56  Wyrmskull: aaa-------aaaaaaaaaaaaa

17:56  Wyrmskull: kvnn: i think i found the problem, i think the file is loaded, but its not formally correct
17:57  kvnn: LOL, whats that mean?
17:58  Wyrmskull: kvnn: its not valid xml
17:59  Wyrmskull: kvnn: the doctype is xml, but it's not a valid document, so it gets loaded by the ajax function, but not loaded as an argument
17:59  JuJuBee: Anybody?  this is driving me nuts.  I have a form inside a div that is hidden.  I have form validation on that form.  If user clicks "new" button, the form in the div is displayed.  If the user presses cancel, the validator fires and displays errors for all fields not filled in.  How do I stop the validator from firing when user presses cancel button?
17:59  JRGould: Wyrmskull: what response code are you getting back from the xhr?
18:00  JRGould: JuJuBee:  what plugin are you using for validation? they probably provide a method to unbind the validation
18:01  JuJuBee: JRGould: the one from position-absolute
18:02  JuJuBee: http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/

19:23  Boohemian: that is, ie...
19:24  dr_traktor: effekt: I think I will use the load method, because I'm writing a script that should be easily embeddable into any site. So the JavaScript should place content, and I can't really rely on people putting every content in advance so that the script will only have to switch it on and off.
19:24  dr_traktor: So this way one can insert only one <script /> tag into the code not the script tag, plus the originally hidden html data.
19:25  dr_traktor: But I was wondering if my script should hold the html in a variable, but that was terribly ugly. So I think I will put the html into html files and use .load()

19:26  SpinachHead: error:    function expected
19:26  effekt: dr_traktor: if you want external sites to include your javascript, don't use ajax if possible at all, due to security constraints ..in that case, do echo from js
19:27  Boohemian: if anybody here can set me up with a slideshow that allows for text over images and a "read more" -esque button (would be best if i can change the text inside that button) that will work in drupal (i can deal with incorporating it into drupal, so long as a module exists for the plugin you want to use), i will pay well... but it has to be done by 5PM boston time
19:27  dr_traktor: effekt: I don't want them to link to my JS on my site. I want them to download a package and place it on their webservers.
19:28  dr_traktor: And AJAX is one of the main reasons they need this script.
19:28  effekt: dr_traktor: in that case load() is just fine
19:28  ProLoser|Work: Boohemian: css3 is pretty decently covered nowadays
19:28  ProLoser|Work: and for ie, you should look at pie.htc
19:28  ProLoser|Work: or use conditional comments
19:28  dr_traktor: That's what I thought, thanks for following me through.
19:28  ProLoser|Work: that's what i do, no more hacks
19:29  JRGould: boohemian - pretty easy to implement with any slideshow plugin (my fave is jquery cycle) just use callbacks to change the text and css to overlay
19:34  beeviz: hey guys
19:34  beeviz: i've got a json object
19:34  Boohemian: JRGould: yeah, but i can't do it - not efficiently at least, and my grant proposal is due at 5pm and this has to be done for it.
19:34  beeviz: and i need the key to a certain value
19:34  beeviz: any idea how
19:34  Boohemian: so i want to PAY people. why won't anybody in #jquery take my money :/
19:34  beeviz: e.g: {0: 'foo', 1: 'bar'}
19:35  beeviz: getKey('bar') --> 1
19:35  JRGould: how much you paying Boohemian ?
19:35  Boohemian: JRGould: is 200$ USD fair?

19:50  danheberden: and set your layout accordingly
19:56  jeremyw: danheberden: Yeah.  Working on that now.
19:58  Today: Is there a relatively simple way to debug ajax content loading to the page? The Firebug console shows the call was made, html was returned as a response but it never makes it to the page sometimes.
19:58  Today: I'd say 1/10 refreshes will have some content simply not show up.
20:00  danheberden: Today: the complete and error callbacks of $.ajax
20:02  Today: •danheberden• Bit confused, do you mean I should find a way to get the callback to display an error about why its not showing up?
20:02  Today: Because right now there aren't any actual errors I can see other than the plain fact it doesn't show up on the page.
20:03  danheberden: well, you seem concerned about it erring
20:03  danheberden: so if it triggers and error, you can see it
20:03  danheberden: and complete will fire as long as it completes
20:03  danheberden: so you can find out whats going on
20:03  Today: That seems like semantics dan, the call is 'completing' as there are no errors showing up in Firebug
20:03  Today: But on the page itself, its just plain not there
20:04  Today: I'm wondering if there is something other than Firebugs console I can look into to see why its not showing up.
20:05  Today: It's just plain puzzling to me - sure it works 9 times out of 10 but telling the customer "sometimes you have to refresh it because stuff just simply doesnt show" seems lame and unprofessional.
20:07  danheberden: Today, other than firebug IS the xhr. Between firebug to make sure it actually went to the server and back, complete the xhr heard anything and error if there was a problem there are no other gaps

20:18 @ajpiano: you could a) use a named function
20:18  Today: I suppose the strange thing is that if the firebug console and firefox think they have html being returned - why doesn't the page I'm viewing. I could understand if 1 out of every 10 refreshes caused some sort of fault - but that fault should show up somewhere.

20:58  datafirm: Is there a way to have jQuery add an id to manipulated items in the dom if they dont already contain an id?
21:01  eTiger13: datafirm: for what?
21:02  datafirm: eTiger13: to identify elements that have been added or manipulated.
21:03  eTiger13: ?attr @ datafirm
21:03  bot-t: datafirm, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/

21:04  datafirm: Im looking to have this done automatically after manipulation, as I stated.
21:04  datafirm: Similar to other libraries, like ExtJS.
21:04  eTiger13: datafirm: and? its not diffferent when it gets done
21:05  datafirm: eTiger13: If there was no id.. id like an UUID of sorts added.
21:05  eTiger13: datafirm: are you talking about jqueryui?
21:05  eTiger13: datafirm: extjs still requires you to define what the id of the new object will be

21:07  eTiger13: m0dmd: huh?
21:08  m0dmd: i'm using that technique as described within that site, however, I need to have another link that can drigger the drop down. For instance clicking on an image

21:10  danheberden: eTiger13: it's like $.fn.frogger
21:10  eTiger13: ?tias @ linelevel
21:10  bot-t: linelevel, Try It And See
21:11  erichynds: linelevel, it will probably request like id=4&id=7 - so however ur server decides to handle that
21:11  linelevel: eTiger13: I have tried it. But that doesn't answer my second question. I don't want to rely on behavior that's not specified to be reliable, and I can't find anything about this in my brief perusal of the specs.

21:25  Dr4g: you missed the point, i'm not uploading a file, the file is d/ling in the backend in PHP
21:25  ravenzz: oh
21:25  Dr4g: the UI will just query it once a second for progress update.
21:25  Dr4g: ajax query to backend to say "20%
21:25  Dr4g: and then jquery to update the nice component for 20%
21:25  Dr4g: get it ?

21:26  Bar_: I must use Content-Dispostion header and server-side language in order to invoke the "Save As" dialog for an image ?
21:26  ravenzz: can you work with file sizes?
21:26  Dr4g: Bar_: correct you do.
21:26  Bar_: thanks.
21:27  Dr4g: else the browser will try to render it's appropriate mime-type and display it accordinly
21:27  Dr4g: eg: show an image, or a pdf
21:27  Bar_: application/x-download is fine as Content-Type ?
21:27  Dr4g: content-disposition will force a download, always.
21:27  Dr4g: bar_ i use the mim type of the file
21:27  Bar_: Dr4g: Really ? And IE6 and stuff doesn't care about it ?
21:27  Dr4g: from my experience, if you set the disposition, it will always download.
21:28  Bar_: very dangerous php file , this one :p
21:28  Dr4g: ravenzz: what ?
21:28  Bar_: ok thanks.. one more question about printing : I want a button that when clicked, it will show the print dialog, but only for a specific image on the page.. is that possible ?
21:28  Dr4g: i will have the full file size.. and check the current downloaded bytes and calc a percentage
21:28  Dr4g: and return that to jquery
21:29  ravenzz: yes?
21:29  ravenzz: you cant?
21:31  Dr4g: i'm looking for a pretty component to display the percentage
21:31  Dr4g: i like uploadify, but it's flash
21:31  Dr4g: unless you can update the uploadify flash component in JS without trying to do the whole file upload thing :)
21:34  ravenzz: uhm yes seems that you have the fla

21:45  ravenzz: instead of using iframes

22:31  serio: something like:
22:31  serio: something like $( '.whatever' ).sequence( {}, speed, delay, callback );
22:32  serio: but, it's pointless if somebody has already done it.
22:33  m0dmd: Ryro that does not work.
22:33  m0dmd: Ryro that's the purpose of first()

22:35  eTiger13: m0dmd: find has to have a selector
22:35  Ryro: m0dmd: do you have html to go with your paste?
22:35  m0dmd: when you say selector, I thought the $(this) uses the parent selector
22:35  m0dmd: ryro it's a drop down styled list

22:36  m0dmd: but i need to be able to use multiple triggers and a few scripts that i've used don't have that option

22:37  eTiger13: m0dmd read that as i dont think you have a good understanding here
22:38  m0dmd: that's no way to help eTiger13
22:39  m0dmd: ...
22:39  Ryro: m0dmd: your paste should work, but it depends on how your html is set up
22:39  eTiger13: m0dmd: well i really dont think you grasp some of the concepts here.  you have a few very knowledgeable people helping you
22:40  m0dmd: that's why you'd help
22:40  eTiger13: m0dmd: and i have yet to see any code pasted
22:40  m0dmd: showing some html Ryro
22:40  m0dmd: you have yet to see because you missed the pastebin links

22:41  eTiger13: i dont support pastebin. please paste to jsfiddle.net and include your html
22:42  m0dmd: I can just add ID numbers and the jquery to the loop, but that is a waste
22:42  Ryro: m0dmd: your html is the problem here
22:42  Ryro: you should use .next('collapse:first') instead of find
22:43  eTiger13: $(this) wont work for you
22:43  eTiger13: or do what Ryro said
22:43  eTiger13: oops meant $(this).find() wont work for you

22:47  eTiger13: ravenzz: try how you think it should be and if that doesnt work, come back and ask. im not going to write your plugin for you

23:03  m0dmd: it's opening the previous collapse div instead.
23:03 @erichynds: you should filter out the open ones

23:12  ravenzz: yes you are right
23:12  ravenzz: but how i can fix it?
23:12  SEJeff_work: What is the best way to select all of the first td elements in a tr in a tbody?
23:13 @erichynds: ravenzz, wrap it in a span tag maybe?
23:13  SEJeff_work: I can select all of them with $('tbody tr td')
23:13  SEJeff_work: But I only want the first td in each tr
23:13  itissid: I have been working on ExtJS for sometime now... But i know JQueryUI is some way away to get to that... One thing I want to ask if there are any devs here... Rather request... ExtJS has this Object.method(...)  kind of philosophy... Which quite frankly sucks cause it changes.. Like take for example selectors... in DOM we do $('div' > 'li') for treepanels we shuld be able to do $('nonLeafnode'>'leafnode'). Maybe change DOM tags to some higher a
23:13  itissid: bstracted tags... in extJS they have  Ext.select() for DOM and a whole plethora of things for treepanels/grids/nodes
23:13 @erichynds: SEJeff_work, $("table td:first-child")
23:13  ravenzz: erichynds dont know which html hi's going to 'process'
23:13  ravenzz: it's*
23:14  itissid: And worst that that is different
23:14  itissid: for different widgets...
23:14  eTiger13: ravenzz: this is slightly better coding practices: http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/9Cqq2/6/
23:14  ravenzz: (my english sucks/alot)

23:15  ravenzz: eTiger13, erichynds thanks
23:16  itissid: eTiger13, I want to request jQueryUI devs to make things simple..
23:16  itissid: Cause ExtJS sucks
23:16  ravenzz: but i think that js lettering doesnt join my needs
23:17  SEJeff_work: itissid, What don't you like about jQ ui?
23:17  eTiger13: itissid: it does but jqui is fine how it is
23:17  ravenzz: i will show <h1> with the same style of normal text, it's just for SEO
23:17 @erichynds: ravenzz, if ur doing that in JS it's not SEO
23:17  eTiger13: ravenzz: oh god. dont worry about SEO. thats the worst thing to do
23:17  bbttxu: got this bit of code http://pastie.org/1345780 basically trying to construct some html in the JS code. stuck on line 13. using jquery to create the elements, but they need to be stored as text, and are not being inserted directly into the DOM
23:17  eTiger13: ravenzz: SEO should not even be part of your vocabulary
23:18  itissid: i like jQuery UI as it is ...i wanyt to talk abut the future..  jQuery UI road map says that its going to make higher lever widgets like treePanels and all...
23:18  ravenzz: why?
23:18 --- nbari|away is now known as nbari
23:18  bbttxu: can you export a jquery object as a string? or do i have to construct it with strings...
23:18  itissid: eTiger13, I want that to be intuitive and simple also ..
23:18  itissid: eTiger13, I dunno if you looked at ExtJS and it is a big mess
23:18  ravenzz: erichynds i know is an aspect.. ive a website with few text, and i need to place some h1 tags that matches my keywords
23:19 @erichynds: search engine bots read the page as is, they don't wait for ur JS to wrap h1 tags around shit and then read it
23:19  ravenzz: oh
23:19  ravenzz: k
23:19  eTiger13: bbttxu: what are you trying to do with that? place.html(html) should be what you want. otherwise place.html is equal to a jquery collection of objects of all the divs on the page
23:19  eTiger13: itissid:  i use extjs everyday and still find jqui to be better in the things it does. its far simpler than extjs already
23:19  nbari: I have a form with multiple checkboxes the onese are made dinamically, how can i post using jqueryvalidate all the checkedboxed and their name in an array?
23:19  jqueryBoy: hi someone use a flexigrid ?
23:19  bbttxu: eTiger13: ultimately a place will be on a google map. this html will be the infobox code
23:20  ravenzz: erichynds one guys at #seo tell me that
23:20  nbari: currently I am using something like: "input[name^='roles']:checked").map(function() {return $(this).val();}).get();
23:20  ravenzz: :[
23:20  SEJeff_work: jqueryBoy, I like datatables.net
23:20  ravenzz: build a plugin that inject h1
23:20  nbari: but that returns just an array of values not an assoc array, any idea?
23:20  ravenzz: into your page
23:20  eTiger13: ravenzz: most people concerned about seo are hacks and are looking to basically rip people off. if you code well and cleanly, and have legitimate content that is relevant, your site will get ranked highly
23:21  ravenzz: yes it's already
23:21  bbttxu: basically want to avoid interpolating js with js, and use jquery objects if possible...

23:22  eTiger13: bbttxu: i still dont understand what you are doing and it looks like what you are doing is excessively complicated
23:22  eTiger13: ravenzz: dont ever go into #seo and like i said, forget seo
23:22  SEJeff_work: Here is a question for you guys. I'm sending an element that contains a regex to a server via $.post
23:22  ravenzz: k
23:22  SEJeff_work: I can decode that urlencoded data with urllib.unquote in python
23:22  SEJeff_work: How can I make that an actual regex?
23:23  SEJeff_work: Because the posted data replaces spaces with +, yet the regex might have actual + signs
23:23  SEJeff_work: uuencode or something ugly?
23:23  tesseracter: any idea why this doesnt work? $('#sortContain select').change( function(){$("#zipForm").submit();});
23:23 @erichynds: ravenzz, even then, wrapping single words over and over in an h1 will probably do more harm than good
23:23 @erichynds: that isn't how well formed sites with good content are layed out
23:23 @erichynds: and that's what they care about the most these days
23:24  ravenzz: maybe.. but as i say i've few contents
23:24  ravenzz: np
23:24  eTiger13: tesseracter: is the id of your form zipForm?
23:24  ravenzz: yes surely its well formed
23:24  tesseracter: eTiger13, yessir
23:24  ravenzz: css and xhtml valid
23:24 @erichynds: thats not what i mean

23:27  eTiger13: tesseracter: whats the code for your submit? are you returning false in it or something?
23:28  tesseracter: eTiger13, i thought i was calling a jquery builtin called .submit, to submit the form
23:28  ravenzz: erichynds i know that.. btw anyone talk about seo.. so sometimes i think 'maybe i've to learn something about it?' even though i got about 40000 unique visits per day
23:29  eTiger13: tesseracter: im asking, do you have any code that happens when the form is submitted? that might prevent it from submitting?
23:30  bbttxu: eTiger13: haha yeah, i tend to over-architect. thanks for the help, got it working: http://pastie.org/1345814
23:30  ravenzz: i only can't express myself as well as i'd want becouse of my bad english
23:31  bbttxu: lines 10-11 are probably shorter if i just used the code directly :)
23:31  peol: bbttxu: $('<h2/>', { text: place.title }) also works ;)

23:42  CFNinja: no. If I look in the thml tab on the console I can see the data
23:43  Ryro: do you have an error method?
23:43 @erichynds: was that no regarding json?
23:43  CFNinja: erichynds: missed your question. half sec. let me confirm
23:43 @erichynds: CFNinja, the success callback won't fire if you're requesting JSON and it's malformed
23:44  CFNinja: no. I this case it is straight html.
23:45  CFNinja: and dataType is specified as HTML
23:45 @erichynds: put something in the error handler and see if it's firing
23:45  CFNinja: Will do. Unfortunately I cannot repeat this on dev or test and to move code to production takes a day. Thanks for the help. I'll followup monday
