08:42  bsoucie: Hello Seion
08:42  danheberden: at first glance it seems perhaps because you're getting all of the contents and then iterating with the jq one
08:43  Seion: http://pastebin.com/2pNb4DAk  not working for me shows testing div anyways like its not accepting the css for one, and also this is on a invision free board
08:43  mekwall: danheberden, where does it get all the contents? :)
08:43  mekwall: danheberden, remember... the jQuery traversing is the faster one... (wrapText2)
08:43  danheberden: $('*', this).contents().filter
08:43  danheberden: yes
08:43  mekwall: which is the faster one ;)
08:43  danheberden: yes
08:44  mekwall: that doesn't say anything as to why javascript traversal is slower
08:44  mekwall: it should be doing the same thing
08:45  mekwall: danheberden, http://www.jsfiddle.net/59mg5/5/ and http://www.jsfiddle.net/59mg5/9/
08:45  mekwall: that's the ones they are based on
08:45  mekwall: as you can see both of them give the same result
08:48  Seion: anyone? when i click the button it just hides it
08:50  Seion: http://pastebin.com/2pNb4DAk  not working for me shows testing div anyways like its not accepting the css for one, and also this is on a invision free board
08:50  mekwall: Seion, use jsfiddle to set up a test case
08:51  sean`: ola compadres
08:51  progrock: anyone know of a betetr way to allow boomarking when using XHR.. otehr than changing the window.location.href to an anchor
08:51  mekwall: in that way we can see exactly what you are doing, and what goes wrong :)
08:51  progrock: bookmarking*
08:52  temp01: change anhor using location.hash
08:53  mekwall: Seion, http://jsfiddle.net/PwkRq/
08:53  mekwall: like that?
08:53  mekwall: that actually works :P
08:53  Seion: lol thanks
08:53  Seion: what was i missing
08:53  mekwall: uhm... I just copy/pasted your code
08:53  superchu: :D
08:53  progrock: temp01: oh, well pretty much same idea... I'm more looking for a more search engine friendly way (ie not using anchors)
08:53  doonie: :}
08:54  mekwall: wrapped it into document.ready
08:54  temp01: progrock: change the path using html5 pushState
08:54  progrock: Ok, so that's the 'future' method essentially
08:54  progrock: and I take it the anchor method is more or less the best way (at least people can bookmark)
08:54  mekwall: ff, chrome, opera and safari already support that progrock  ;)
08:55  mekwall: and that's a bit over 50% of the users
08:55  mekwall: so it's a good solution for those users
08:55  mekwall: when it comes to ie users... they probably don't know what bookmarks is
08:56  doonie: book mark? whats that
08:56  mekwall: doonie, it's that mark you put in the book to remember where you left it :P
08:56  doonie: ah ofc. jut what I thought
08:56  mekwall: "what does that have to do with the internets?"
08:56  doonie: foxmarks will be bought ;> hope they don't screw with my bookmarks
08:56  mekwall: why do you use it?
08:57  doonie: crossbrowser sync
08:57  mekwall: ah
08:57  progrock: hahaha, I like your guys reasoning
08:58  mekwall: doonie, guess you could use xmarks for that as well
08:58  doonie: that's the ones I ment ;D
08:58  doonie: old name was foxmarks I think
08:58  mekwall: aha
08:58  doonie: yepp old name
08:58  doonie: "Our favorite way to keep Firefox bookmarks synced... now offered for Internet Explorer and Safari." © 2009 Xmarks, Inc. (Formerly Foxmarks) ...
08:58  mekwall: didn't know they switched name
08:58  Seion: mekwall still having issues with invisionfree ....
08:58  mekwall: Seion, in what way?
08:59  Seion: button does nothing lol i posted code from javascrip from fiddle in javascript board wrapper and in body went the div and button
08:59  Seion: is <script></script> okay for it
09:00  temp01: link us to fiddle
09:00  Seion: the fiddle works
09:00  Seion: just doesnt work on invisionfree board
09:01  Seion: http://jsfiddle.net/PwkRq/
09:01  temp01: well, you suck at fiddling then
09:01  progrock: hmmm if arrayVar[1] is not defined.. why would the typeof(arrayVar[1]) == 'string' ?
09:02  temp01: progrock: that would mean it's defined
09:02  temp01: console.log it
09:03  progrock: temp01: thats what I;m doing.. the value shows up as undefined.. but its type is dtring
09:03  progrock: string*
09:03  temp01: maybe it's "undefined"
09:03  temp01: a string
09:04  progrock: it appears so.. but why is the question
09:04  progrock: and I'm compaing it to undefined not 'undefined'
09:04  temp01: where are you comparing it to undefined?
09:04  temp01: pastebin code?
09:05  progrock: trying to get the 'important' parts so you dont have to see the other BS code
09:05  temp01: BS code is what creates BS problems
09:06  progrock: http://pastebin.com/UkbxBG0A
09:06  progrock: well if that doesnt show it, I'l post the full code, lol.. but dont think you want that
09:06  earthmeLon: I'm having trouble with:  var whatever = "#"+id;	$(whatever).show();        Is this legal?
09:07  temp01: yes, it is
09:07  temp01: FBI won't come to arrest you
09:07  earthmeLon: :P
09:07  temp01: progrock: what's the value of location.hash at the time the code runs
09:08  earthmeLon: Well, I put an alert above it to make sure whatever was the correct string.  It is an it's value is "#fname", but the fname div is not show()ing v-v
09:08  temp01: earthmeLon: you might want to console.log($(whatever)) and see if it's finding the element or not
09:08  progrock: in the test case, undefined
09:08  temp01: progrock: value of location.hash
09:08  temp01: not the array[1]
09:08  progrock: oh, lol, sorry
09:09  progrock: ni the words of firebug '(an empty string)'
09:09  devinrolsen: man I got this weird error due to a freaking background color. My elements wont animate (on mouse over its parent) the first time I mouse over, but will the second time. If I remove the background color from the parent, it works perfect... this sound familiar to anyone?
09:09  devinrolsen: background color is set via css btw lol
09:09  progrock: devinrolsen: sounds pretty danm random
09:09  devinrolsen: indeed
09:10  progrock: your html/css validate?
09:10  earthmeLon: Wow, thanks temp01.  Wasn't aware of that trick.  Well, I see the problem, but I have no idea what to do.  It's pulling another DOM lol.
09:10  devinrolsen: and the animation is just width and height.. I would expect this from a fade in and out
09:10  temp01: ?unique id @ earthmeLon
09:10  bot-t: earthmeLon, An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
09:11  earthmeLon: temp01, it's pulling it from another DOM... another Document... another webpage lol
09:11  temp01: no way
09:11  earthmeLon: It's pulling from my xml document.
09:11  progrock: oh man, that reminds me of a guy I was heling in here a week ago... he needed his code to work with multiple elements with the same ID... i tried multiple times to explain to him that invalid HTML is nto what you should  be workign with.. period
09:11  earthmeLon: :P
09:13  progrock: well temp01, I know my problem isn;t really important... but definitely still confused.  I'm splitting an empty string on '/'... why would the result[1] == undefined, but typeof(result[1]) == 'string'
09:14  progrock: wow
09:14 --- esmaxwill is now known as esmaxwill|z
09:14  progrock: nevermind
09:14 --- esmaxwill|z is now known as esmaxwil|z
09:14  temp01: progrock: ?
09:14  progrock: now it is undefined..
09:16  progrock: now I kinda wanna figure out what changed it lol.. since it was deifnitely coming up as string, then stil == undefined...
09:16  progrock: lol.. it was my stupidity actually.
09:17  earthmeLon: I'm trying to figure out ajax.  I'm within the ajax function and I want to manipulate the original DOM.  It's stuck searching the XML instead, for some reason
09:18  progrock: i was doing typeof(..) != undefined... not 'undefined'...
09:20  earthmeLon: http://pastebin.com/n6VnANRV
09:21  earthmeLon: http://pastebin.com/ZJK6Pcvw < Has the code
09:22  superchu: i hate .net's stupid ajax-framework with updatepanels and shit..
09:22  superchu: wrote my own updatepanel..
09:22 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
09:23  progrock: earthmeLon: are you simply trying to replace a containers contents?
09:23  progrock: earthmeLon: out of curiousity, seeing how this is a jquery channel.. is there a reason your not cimplifying shit by using jquery?
09:24  devinrolsen: http://www.devinrolsne.com/jpeek/ yes html and css are valid progrock :(
09:24  earthmeLon: This is my first ajax script progrock, so i dont know why I'm not lol
09:24  progrock: earthmeLon: lol.. jquery makes ajax VERY simple
09:25  JKarsrud: earthmeLon: Do it, $.ajax ftw
09:25  earthmeLon: kk
09:25  JKarsrud: ?ajax
09:25  bot-t: jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
09:25  progrock: devinrolsen: that page isnt loading for me
09:25  progrock: earthmeLon: or you can be even more lazy and use .load
09:25  JKarsrud: progrock: http://www.devinrolsen.com/jpeek/
09:25  devinrolsen: http://www.devinrolsen.com/jpeek/ lol guess I forgot how to spell my own name
09:26  devinrolsen: thanks JK
09:26  JKarsrud: And I figured it out before you, dude! :P
09:26  devinrolsen: lol been a long day
09:26  doonie: A for effort ;>
09:26  earthmeLon: progrock Im creating an input validation script.  I pass the input's name to my php script and it returns xml with a corresponding div id and whether or not it's valid.  If it's valid, I want the hidden div to go from hidden to shown to show that it's valid
09:26  mekwall: jpeek is buggy
09:26  mekwall: on chrome... when I move mouse out of the windo it opens the peek :P
09:26  mekwall: +w
09:26  coldhead: everything is buggy
09:26  progrock: devinrolsen: whats the problem? it seems ok in chrome
09:27  coldhead: its how we roll
09:27  mekwall: we roll in a buggy!
09:27  coldhead: conditions on earth are quite intolerable
09:27  mekwall: beach buggy
09:27  devinrolsen: must be a fire fox thing
09:27  progrock: earthmeLon: soudns like a tiem to use JSON
09:27  devinrolsen: the images when you open it for the first time, should grow in to view
09:27  progrock: earthmeLon: if you have your php send you JSON instead of XML, your JS will be extremely simple
09:28  devinrolsen: but right now they just pop into view, but if you close and open it again it works as should
09:28 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
09:28  devinrolsen: and it all is result of the background color (#fff) on the parent element lol
09:28  devinrolsen: let me remove it and you will see
09:28  earthmeLon: progrock So, basically what you're telling me is that i've wasted 3 hours of my life and there is no point to living anymore? :P
09:28  progrock: devinrolsen: I think its safe to say its somethign due to teh loading of the images
09:28  JKarsrud: earthmeLon: No, that's not what he's saying, he just told you how to live life properly ;)
09:29  progrock: earthmeLon: I'm telling you theres a very simple way to do it
09:29  earthmeLon: I'll def take a look over this jquery.ajax doc and figure out json.  Is there a library for json you recommend?
09:29  devinrolsen: well you would think progrock
09:29  devinrolsen: how ever let me switch animation type
09:29  devinrolsen: works perfect
09:29  JKarsrud: earthmeLon: What version of PHP are you on?
09:29  earthmeLon: 5.3
09:29  JKarsrud: Then you can use json_encode :)
09:29  progrock: earthmeLon: json really is not hard to learn.. and in fact.. PHP is very good at outputting json.. probably easier than XML
09:30  devinrolsen: try it now progrock
09:30  earthmeLon: I used json once before with a facebook thing.  I loved it
09:30  devinrolsen: fade animation now
09:30  mekwall: json is kinda like javascript, but with a bit stricter notation
09:30  progrock: devinrolsen: I think its because the height/width are not known for the otehr animation till image loads.. or similar problem
09:31  JKarsrud: earthmeLon: Just send the object you're returning as xml to json_encode() in php, and you're set :)
09:31  devinrolsen: indeed, I am seeing some mixed results from just a few mins ago
09:31  devinrolsen: I think it has to do with how I just packed my script to show you guys
09:31  progrock: well, bookmarks now work :) still a very trivial animation, but its somethign different  http://www.carmosinocontracting.com/#/contactus/
09:31  mekwall: devinrolsen, why did you pack it if you want us to help? :)
09:31  earthmeLon: Well, I'd rather go from array->json_encode().  I'll check php.net for docs on it
09:32  JKarsrud: whatever floats your boat ;)
09:32  devinrolsen: figured it would be faster to load
09:32  progrock: earthmeLon: you will be very happy when you realize how simple the task is now
09:32  JKarsrud: I'm not a PHP man, so :)
09:32  JKarsrud: earthmeLon: Either way, now you can just use $.getJSON in jquery, simple as pie :)
09:32  JKarsrud: ?getJSON
09:32  bot-t: jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
09:32  doonie: pie isn't simple ;\
09:32  mekwall: devinrolsen, of course it is... but why would it matter when we are debugging it? :)
09:33  JKarsrud: doonie: Orly, what kind of pies are you making? :P
09:33  mekwall: and we are talking about a couple of more ms to load it anyways
09:33  progrock: oneof these days I'll make some JS worth minification.. till then.. my JS will be nice and easy for anyone to look at and steal
09:33  doonie: JKarsrud halloween ones ;>
09:34  JKarsrud: doonie: The pies are simple, it's the damned pumpkins that aren't ;)
09:34  Guest_578_: hi folks, I am trying to think of a good approach  to switching a divs content from a button that increments through an array
09:34  Guest_578_: any recommendations?
09:34  Guest_578_: the heck is my alias Guest_578_ for, that isn't cool
09:34  doonie: mine is made out of toiletpaper!
09:34  Guest_578_: and each array element has the content i want to put into the div
09:35  progrock: Guest_578_: umm.. i think tis (#divID).html(array[index]);
09:35  progrock: ?html
09:35  bot-t: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
09:36  Guest_578_: so where does the iterating with the buttons come into place
09:36 --- jamesmacleod is now known as codespectator
09:36  Guest_578_: button*
09:37  Guest_578_: checking out the API now
09:37  progrock: Guest_578_: oh.. prety trivial.. jsut have the button increment or decrement a var that represents the index
09:37  Guest_578_: for that.. look at what you mean
09:37  Guest_578_: hm
09:37  Guest_578_: lol
09:37  progrock: Guest_578_: $(#buttonID).click(function() { indexNum++; }
09:37  progrock: oh.. });
09:38  progrock: and add the $ to the fisrt example of course
09:38  Guest_578_: and the .html() method will update the div automatically?
09:38  bertt: $(".trappedMiner").eq(5).replaceClass(".rescuedMiner");
09:38  Guest_578_: when that variable gets incremented?
09:38  JKarsrud: Guest_578_: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/UE8a5/
09:38  JKarsrud: ?
09:39  progrock: Guest_578_: pretty much.. html() will get the div's content... html(string) will rewrite the conent
09:39  progrock: Guest_578_: should be exactly what you need
09:40  Guest_578_: JKarsud: Exactly
09:40  Guest_578_: now I will just reset the counter once it reaches the last element in the array
09:40  JKarsrud: See? That wasn't hard, it took me exactly one minute to write :)
09:40  JKarsrud: Yeah, do it :)
09:40  Guest_578_: so it goes to the first when its done
09:40  Guest_578_: ha thanks buddy
09:40  Guest_578_: im really stoned and tired
09:40  Guest_578_: honestly
09:40  JKarsrud: no probl, not that I've got any work to di
09:40  JKarsrud: do
09:41  Guest_578_: ha
09:41  mekwall: I've finally decided I'm gonna start blogging
09:41  seutje: go u!
09:41  progrock: damn it JKarsrud
09:41  progrock: ?tijnh
09:41  bot-t: This is #jquery, not #handholding.
09:41  seutje: the world needs another blog
09:41  progrock: :)
09:41  JKarsrud: progrock: relax, figured it would take a less amout of time :)
09:41  progrock: JKarsrud: jsut joking.. i couldnt care less
09:42  JKarsrud: I know ;)
09:42  mekwall: seutje, nah... actually I'm very much against blogging
09:42  Guest_578_: JKarsud: thanks again ;]
09:42  Guest_578_: and the others as well
09:42  progrock: And thought it was funny I remmebered one of the trivial bot t commands... some peopel in here seem to have an insane number memorized
09:42  seutje: so wait, we can't hold hands and sing kumbaya?
09:42  mekwall: seutje, most blogs are just bs :)
09:43  mekwall: I've finally got a good reason to have a blog. I need somewhere to put down my solutions and share them with the world
09:44  progrock: Lol.. I wouldnt dare make a blog.. I know it might make it to 3 posts.. but definitely never to 4
09:44  Eaven: so how much are you guys charging per hour?? since you got no work and all.. maybe we can work something out :)
09:44  Guest_578_: progrock: sorry for being lazy and just asking, i am busy with Rails stuff mostly
09:44  mekwall: Eaven, that's called exploiting
09:44  Guest_578_: and people usually just spit it out in here, as I do in the rails channel
09:44  Guest_578_: thats what theyre here for ;)
09:45  Eaven: um how so? contracting out work because we have too much and others dont have any is exploiting?
09:45  progrock: Guest_578_: oh, I dont really care, most of us are lazy.... I just remmebered that bot command randomly, and it was a valid time
09:45  Eaven: i considered it, feeding niggas but... guess not
09:45  progrock: I prefer to get you to understand the basics of what you are doing.. and il get you 90% of the way
09:45  mekwall: Eaven, no... the way you put it, that's exploiting
09:46 --- brianpWins_ is now known as brianpWins
09:46  mekwall: Eaven, you can rephrase it and call it a win-win situation instead :)
09:46  Eaven: each person will interpret the painting differently
09:46  mekwall: Eaven, not if the painting is ugly
09:46 * mekwall chuckles
09:48  temp01: lol
09:48  Eaven: no but seriously JKarsrud... you say you have no work... how much do you contract out at
09:48  mekwall: Eaven, I'm just saying... if you want people with skills, maybe recruiting based on the lowest possible pay isn't the best way ;)
09:48  progrock: I honestly hate having to define a function before calling it... can screw up my code organization
09:48  Eaven: wasn't trying to pay lowest possible pay
09:49  mekwall: But at least you can say, when the house collapses, that it didn't cost you that much :D
09:49  Eaven: but to not deal with project management or client relations... there is always a deserved break on rate... pure programming rates
09:50  mekwall: Eaven, of course. I'm not saying you are wrong, I just think that the way you asked for services was a bit too arrogant for my taste
09:50  Eaven: and temp01 :) I was talkin shit against my homie... told him "i bet temp could write it in 3 lines" :)
09:50  Eaven: well im glad we're going through the interview process now than later
09:51  mekwall: Eaven, so... I wanted you to know about that, because I think that I'm not the only one hehe
09:51  temp01: I can write it in -3 lines
09:51  Eaven: thats what i was trying to say
09:51  Eaven: he wouldnt understand
09:51  Eaven: ;x
09:51  Eaven: i told him his 7 lines were inferior to temp01
09:51  Eaven: lol
09:51  Guest_578_: temp01
09:52  Guest_578_: do u wanna see the code he is talking about?
09:52  temp01: sup random guest
09:52  Guest_578_: he seriously said that
09:52  Guest_578_: man

09:52  Eaven: we're on the phone

09:53  Eaven: an
09:53  kungfumaster: man, so temp01
09:53  JKarsrud: Eaven: I'm really busy dude,it was irony. I've got way too much to do at work here, so trying to hire me is no good ;)
09:53  temp01: ya, pastebin it kungfumaster
09:53  JKarsrud: And I don't think you can top my pay either way :P
09:53  kungfumaster: i had to do some custom shipping calculators for a hosted ecommerce solution based on item category, price and country
09:53  Eaven: lol ok
09:53  mekwall: kungfumaster, that's a great game ;)
09:53  Eaven: im sure we probably bill out at the same rate :)
09:54  mekwall: s/that's/was

09:54  Eaven: i still say he could do it in 3 or less
09:54  JKarsrud: Wtf
09:54  kungfumaster: it was for a foxycart integration
09:55  temp01: WTF++
09:55  Eaven: lol
09:55  Eaven: see
09:55  Eaven: i told you kungfumaster
09:55  JKarsrud: And with that I'm going for a smoke :/
09:55  kungfumaster: Eaven: shut up
09:55  kungfumaster: haha
09:55  JKarsrud: That actually hurt my eyes
09:55  Eaven: i hope its chronic JKarsrud
09:55  kungfumaster: my code? :[
09:55  kungfumaster: thats fucked up!
09:55  kungfumaster: lol
09:56  JKarsrud: I have one word for you
09:56  JKarsrud: TEMPLATES
09:56  progrock: lol
09:56  kungfumaster: criticizing me is one thing, but do you need to rip my heart out?
09:56  temp01: have you tested this in IE kungfumaster
09:56  kungfumaster: why do you ask?
09:56  JKarsrud: and remove all the stuff you've got going there with the onclick attributes and stuff
09:56  temp01: it most likely won't work
09:56  kungfumaster: can i respond to a question with a question lol
09:56  kungfumaster: why do you say that?
09:56  kungfumaster: no i didnt
09:56  kungfumaster: safari and ff
09:57  mr_lou: Hello all.
09:57  temp01: IE doesn't support "foo".trim() --- $(this).text().trim()
09:57  Eaven: mr_lou: wait your turn
09:57  progrock: lol
09:57  mr_lou: <-- learning jQuery and reading tutorials.
09:57  kungfumaster: Oh
09:57  mr_lou: Eaven: Easy now.
09:57  kungfumaster: i was not aware, what do you recommend as an alternative?
09:57  Eaven: I'm always gentle
09:57  temp01: you can use $.trim( $(this).text() )
09:57  kungfumaster: could you point me in the right direction i mean
09:57  progrock: Haha, mr_lou got any questions, or ojsut saying hi?
09:58  temp01: ?jquery.trim
09:58  bot-t: jQuery.trim(): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
09:58  temp01: $.trim(x) vs x.trim()
09:58  temp01: and then use templating and classes
09:58  Eaven: is there a good blog about these concepts?
09:58  Eaven: ;x
09:58  kungfumaster: i dont even know what that means
09:58  kungfumaster: lol
09:58  mr_lou: progrock: Well, did have a question. Nothing important though. Just reading some beginner tutorials at jQuery.com, and found this line in an example: $("#rating").append("<a href='#'>" + i + "</a> ");
09:59  kungfumaster: ^what he said
09:59  mr_lou: progrock: My question is, isn't it more correct to type it like this: $("#rating").append('<a href="#">' + i + '</a> ');
09:59  progrock: mr_lou: umm, I believe either or is sompletely fine
09:59  mr_lou: progrock: It's the HTML attributes inside " instead of ' I'm thinking about.
09:59  progrock: completely*
09:59  Eaven: mr_lou: id rather have the object inside of "'
09:59  Eaven: rather '
09:59  Eaven: ' should be used for attributes
09:59  progrock: mr_lou: I think thats really jsut personal preference, when it comes to HTML, attributes between " " and ' ' are handled the same
10:00  mr_lou: progrock: I see. I always thought attributes had to be inside "
10:00  Eaven: nope
10:00  progrock: mr_lou: nope.. just preference. I use whichever is easer for my code
10:00  mr_lou: Ok then.
10:00  kungfumaster: hahaha I was using the jquery method like a named scope in rails
10:00  kungfumaster: wow
10:00  Eaven: if you get into actual programming you'll want to use this format
10:00  kungfumaster: I see the problem now, temp01
10:00  Eaven: " 'string'  + i + 'string' "
10:00  temp01: kungfumaster: instead of putting all the html in the script in a string - can't you put it in the html file and .show()/hide() it
10:00  Eaven: always
10:00  kungfumaster: any other recommendations on the code?
10:01  progrock: mr_lou: might I recommend rebecca murphy's intro 'book'.. quite good for beginners.. and you get he bonus of being able to bother her in here
10:01  mr_lou: Eaven: Well I did it that way for a long time (PHP coding), untill I read somewhere (or someone told me, can't remember) that I should use ", so I changed my PHP coding style. And now I see this on jQuery....tsk. I'm tired of religion..hehe
10:01  temp01: kungfumaster: you weren't using a jquery method, you were using the string's trim method which isn't cross-browser
10:01  progrock: mr_lou: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html
10:02  kungfumaster: temp01: i have tended that issue
10:02  mr_lou: progrock: Wow, thanks. I'll print that right away. :-)
10:03  progrock: mr_lou: as far as the " vs ' from php.. actually i havea  simple technique.. if the string is static in php I use ' ' in php, spo the attributes would be " "..... but if the string not static.. vice versa (of course you could always escape the quotes.. but hwy if you dont need to)
10:04  kungfumaster: cool
10:04 --- cna_ is now known as cna
10:04  mr_lou: progrock: Did I imagine some w3 validator not validating my HTML because it used ' instead of " ? Hmm.... could test again of course.
10:04  progrock: mr_lou: yes you did
10:06  mr_lou: progrock: Ok then. :-)
10:06  mr_lou: Thanks progrock and Eaven
10:06  progrock: no problem
10:09  progrock: hmm.. so how much worse is an XHR request in comparison to say loading an image?
10:09  lightharut: I need some kind of table with pagination from jquery. it should be very simple with 3 rows.
10:09  Cork: progrock: "wors then loading an image?
10:10  Cork: its the same if you only look at overhead
10:10  JKarsrud: Hmm, time to rip some code off  the wheel of satisfaction on getsatisfaction.com
10:11  progrock: Cork: really? of course I meant from an overhead standpoint.... for some reason I thought an XHR request was 'a lot' worse
10:11  progrock: wellI didnt think, i thought I read somewhere saying that, lol
10:12  Cork: procto: it adds one extra x- header line
10:12  Cork: thats it
10:12  progrock: oh, not too bad at all
10:13  Cork: progrock: and that header is only to make it posible for the server to know its xhr
10:13  progrock: so I should be just as concerned with the number of image sprites as I am with the number of 'pages' loaded via XHR requetss
10:13  JKarsrud: one sprite to rule them all
10:13  Cork: progrock: no not sprites
10:14  Cork: progrock: one image is the same as one xhr
10:14  Cork: not one sprite part
10:14  progrock: thats what I meant, I apologize for the wording
10:14  Cork: ah
10:16  Cork: progrock: btw a side note the header is "X-Requested-With:"
10:17  progrock: Hmm, guess thats good to know for my logs
10:18  progrock: oh, not too bad at all coding conventions in JavaScript.. compared to my Python or PHP, my JS is pretty ugly, and does not conform with OOP styles
10:19  progrock: wow, must have presed up mid sentence
10:19  progrock: meant to say, I ened to step up my coding conventions in JS
10:21  ignotus: hi, how can I know if a div has been $(..).(hide)'d?
10:22  progrock: ?hide
10:22  bot-t: .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
10:22  progrock: hmm.. does it set diplay: non, or visibilit: hidden....
10:22  progrock: ?source hide
10:22  bot-t: Line#5500 - "hide: function( speed, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#line-5500
10:23  JKarsrud: progrock: display: none
10:23  pi3r: do there is a plugin for displaying a loading spinner during an ajax call
10:23  pi3r: ?
10:23  progrock: ignotus: tehre you go .css('display') == 'none'
10:23  ignotus: progrock: thanks!:)
10:23  pi3r: or a good example how to do it
10:26  progrock: pi3r: I havent used one (everything I load is loaded quickly).. btu I'm sure theres 100 tutorials on it
10:26  progrock: pi3r: or if you wait a little when people are more active in here, I'm sure someone will reocmmend a specific method
10:26  pi3r: yeah i'm looking at some
10:26  pi3r: progrock, thanks :D
10:27  pi3r: progrock, usually it's fast too but here the server is weak as hell
10:27  doonie: ?g ajaxstart gif
10:27  bot-t: doonie, Jquery Block ui only show on ajaxStart of a function - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2293430/jquery-block-ui-only-show-on-ajaxstart-of-a-function
10:27  doonie: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68485/how-to-show-loading-spinner-in-jquery @ pi3r
10:28  progrock: hmm.. I should think about implememnting something for those cases of the server hanging.. but nginx on a solid vps runs faster than I can blink
10:28  doonie: use the ajaxstart function, that will hook to all your ajaxcalls
10:28  pi3r: doonie, thanks  :D
10:28  pi3r: doonie, found this http://jquery-values.googlecode.com/svn/other/loading/jquery.loading.htm
10:28  pi3r: looks sexy
10:28  doonie: ew :)
10:28  ashutosh: i am getting error in jQuery 1.2.3 :- "safari is not defined " but my code is for firefox only  and no where use the word safari in code
10:28  ashutosh: ?
10:29  progrock: ashutosh: maybe try updating the jquery version you are using
10:29  pi3r: progrock, i have to take a look at nginx :D
10:29  ashutosh: problem comes while using the zooming tool
10:29  pi3r: i'm to used to apache ...
10:29  pi3r: s/to/too
10:29  progrock: pi3r: I can;'t stress how much I am in love with it
10:29  doonie: I can!
10:30  suunto: heya guys and girl,
10:30  doonie: nginx pwns the wrldz
10:30  progrock: haha
10:30  suunto: s
10:30  pi3r: :D
10:30  pi3r: so i will give it a try !
10:30  doonie: its worth it
10:30  progrock: pi3r: honestly.. I load pages from half way across the continent so fast i would have sworn they were local
10:30  pi3r: hehe
10:31  pi3r: but there is really a performance diff from apache?
10:31  progrock: its like the first time you open a browser after switchign from windows to linux... the page is loaded while youre waiting to see somethings telling you its loading (like a mouse changing to a timer)
10:31  doonie: pi3r yes
10:31  pi3r: it's all i want to know :D
10:31  doonie: server ram also responds well :}
10:31  pi3r: next project
10:31  progrock: pi3r: my serevr runs php/mysql/nginx on les than 10mb of ram... yes VERY different performance than apache.. and the serevr can handle A LOT of requests at 1 time
10:31  pi3r: nginx :D
10:32  pi3r: or maybe now
10:32  pi3r: :D
10:32  JKarsrud: pfft, IIS ftw :P
10:32  doonie: heh
10:32  pi3r: JKarsrud, AH AH
10:32  doonie: JK ;P
10:33  JKarsrud: We use IIS, but that's because we're a .NET company all the way :P
10:33  doonie: noway ;p
10:33  JKarsrud: Personlly I'd use nginx though :)
10:33  JKarsrud: It owns
10:33  pi3r: hum
10:33  pi3r: i have access to the production server
10:34  JKarsrud: Just need a VPS to play with. nginx + node.js :)
10:34  JKarsrud: would kick ass
10:34  doonie: host it at home ;P
10:34  JKarsrud: Yeah, when I get my iMac I could
10:34  doonie: !!
10:34  mongag: http://jsfiddle.net/q6t7W/  Can you recommend me a way when is clicked on the second box to disappear and in its place to move the third box ?
10:34  doonie: I think I just bought one today JK
10:34  JKarsrud: Use my old macbook as a server :)
10:34  doonie: well tomorrow :}
10:34  JKarsrud: Nice :d
10:34  pi3r: maybe i'm gonna to migrate from apache to nginx today !
10:34  doonie: ya almost 1k€ off
10:35  doonie: i7 ssd+hdd
10:35  doonie: 8gb
10:35  JKarsrud: waiting for pay day on the 20th, then I'll blow off $3200 on the iMac
10:35  doonie: ya thats what I found this beast for
10:36  progrock: pi3r: def worth a shot.. and you can run it on such a low end VPS
10:36  JKarsrud: I'll just go for the HDD with 4GB ram and buy 16gb later
10:36  doonie: yea would have done the same, but this guy is selling a week old one for the same price.. can't say no ;>
10:36  pi3r: progrock, let's roll --> google.com?q=apache+to+nginx
10:37  JKarsrud: Then I would do the same thing :)
10:37  doonie: ya and then remove vat from 4600$ myahaha
10:38  progrock: pi3r: I will say nginx documentation is a little harder to find... but if you're not doing naythign crazy.. its fantastic, and easy enough
10:38  JKarsrud: If I was to buy it from apple norway with 1tb + 256gb it would be $4300 :(
10:38  JKarsrud: Can't afford that
10:38  JKarsrud: :P
10:38  doonie: heh that's what this guy did :D
10:38  doonie: insano
10:38  doonie: ppl with money are funny
10:38  JKarsrud: Crazy
10:38  JKarsrud: Heh
10:38  JKarsrud: Yeah
10:38  doonie: and to later sell it...
10:38  progrock: lol.. I could never see myself buying a mac.. but thats all I'll say, dont want a flame war
10:38  pi3r: progrock, k thanks :D, i just need to make my boss understand i'm making something usefull :D
10:39  doonie: =) I thought so to, but then they made steam work on mac :D
10:39  doonie: so now I have steam and photoshop so im happy
10:39  doonie: and a clean desk with no cables heh
10:39  JKarsrud: I just need to clear my desk a little bit, now it's too cluttered
10:39  doonie: will sit nicely with my 24" external
10:39  progrock: pi3r: if you did some benchmarks, it would be a joke at how much quicker nginx would be
10:39  doonie: it will make it look tiny :D
10:40  progrock: pi3r: if you need any help with rewrite rules let me know.. slightly different between apache and nginx.. but easy enough
10:40  doonie: i hate that nginx conf is tooooo simpel sometimes
10:40  JKarsrud: 24" external monitor, with a 13" macbook on a stand beside it, 2 rokit6 g2 studio monitors, a midicontroller sitting on top of my 1U external audiocard...
10:40  progrock: haha, too simple
10:40  JKarsrud: Too much shit on my desk
10:40  pi3r: progrock, one question remain, i'm using phusion for redmine on my apache, do you know if nginx can handle it
10:40  pi3r: cause webrick really suck :D
10:41  progrock: IS PHUSION SOMETHING TO DO WITH PASSENGER?
10:41  progrock: oops caps lock
10:41  doonie: progrock yea to easy in a way that I can't go into a location, and then do some logics :\
10:41  doonie: have to ahve multiple locations for similar things
10:42  doonie: eg I have a catcher for /tools and for that I need a php catcher and one for static content..
10:42  progrock: doonie: you definitely can run it.. but might be a ltitle tricky... one thing you can always do with nginx is actualyl have it proxy to apache for stuff you ened apache for
10:42  doonie: now when I have 10 others, I suddenly have 20 locations ;\
10:42  doonie: apache will never run on my server :D
10:42  doonie: maybe varnish but never apache
10:42  progrock: well you could jsut make the apprpriate rewrite rules
10:43  doonie: I can't :]
10:43  doonie: those catchers do what they should..
10:43  doonie: you can hax it to work somehow, but I want i tto work on all nginx updates heh
10:44  progrock: hmm, yeah, i dn
10:44  progrock: for a simple site, I rewrite everything eithout a '.' to index.php
10:44  doonie: hmm
10:44  superchu: JohnResig: when will jQuery 1.4.3 be out?
10:45  doonie: I first have a catcher for static content, then one for php.
10:45  doonie: and then the extra passwordprotected folders..
10:45  doonie: and their locations as their root is different
10:45  progrock: yeah, i have similar for static
10:46  fbjork: /join #jqueryui
10:46  progrock: I ctualyl dont use password protected folders.. I'll have folders that are not in the public, thats as far as I go
10:46  doonie: :) well I want to access them heh
10:46  doonie: so first they are not in public + password so I can get to them
10:46  progrock: doonie: well my php scripts can access them.. not anyone from the outside
10:47  doonie: well I use it for tools.. like phpmyadmin and other scripts
10:47  doonie: hard to make my php call them
10:47  progrock: oh... those are on a seperate URL with ssl
10:47  progrock: seperate domain i mean
10:47  doonie: ya that would be a way.. same thing ;D
10:48  progrock: beyond that, I never realyl access the fiels directly.. jsut pull repos and push
10:48  progrock: files*
10:48  doonie: which
10:49  progrock: which waht?
10:49  doonie: which files
10:49  progrock: oh.. all my web conent are stores as local git repos
10:49  progrock: content*
10:49  doonie: hehe
10:50  doonie: I use a custom svn push sys. to keep things up to date
10:50  progrock: ewww... subversion.. for people who don't understand real version control :P
10:50  doonie: heh rite
10:51  blackspotwiggins: what is real? how do you define real?
10:51  progrock: haha.. then again, version control is version control for basic shit
10:51  blackspotwiggins: </morpheus>
10:51  progrock: I like distributed version control.. its fantastic
10:51  doonie: :))
10:51  doonie: I like it all in one place
10:51  blackspotwiggins: svn is as real as cvs before that
10:51  progrock: doonie: well its all in one place.. jsut every place you go has ti all
10:52  doonie: I'm not fond of the networks, merges and stuff..
10:52  progrock: blackspotwiggins: was just watching Linus Torvalds hour long google presentation... half of my anti subversion attitude is a joke
10:52  JKarsrud: svn is epic dammit
10:52  JKarsrud: :P
10:52  doonie: linus and his crazy ideas
10:52  doonie: he's a bum :D
10:53  blackspotwiggins: linux also said that c++ is evil
10:53  JKarsrud: what a piece of shit software he's written too
10:53  progrock: doonie: its pretty easy to get used to.. and certain things are jsut amazing.. epseically when your on vacation without internet and you have every version of your project from day 1 to present with you
10:53  blackspotwiggins: + he cant really say any vcs besides git is good
10:53  doonie: yea I can agree on that part, its nice to locally submit stuff
10:53  doonie: still not as simple as svn on all the other things
10:53  doonie: alteasy not yet for me :) but that's just me
10:53  progrock: blackspotwiggins: yes, he is very biased.... but he's made some successful stuff ;)
10:54  progrock: doonie: well I feel the industry standard is still subversion.. but that is very rapidly changing
10:56  doonie: yeah I've seen it come along more
10:57  doonie: but also see ppl moving away from it :]
10:57  progrock: I havent seen too much of that
10:57 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
10:57  progrock: I cant stand mercurial tho.. obviously based on git.. but not compatible with... so annoying to see a lot of places using it
10:58  doonie: :)
10:58  JKarsrud: hah: http://shouldilearnjavascript.com/
10:59  doonie: what a waste of cyberspace ;D
10:59  JKarsrud: Most sensible site I've come across all day
11:02  doonie: dip dip
11:03  progrock: so what is this.. the 30 minutes thsi channel isnt full of people asking beginner questions?
11:03  blackspotwiggins: easy
11:03  sean`: HIP HIP
11:03  blackspotwiggins: how do i make link goe ajax to databse and get row?
11:04  sean`: who has the #promotejs link on their site
11:05  progrock: blackspotwiggins: ok, that makes the channel feel closer to normal
11:05  JKarsrud: sean`: I will have it when I get my site up :)
11:06  JKarsrud: Saw you got yours yesterday
11:06  blackspotwiggins: if i have <a><button></a>
11:06  blackspotwiggins: IE doesnt follow the anchor if i click on button :/
11:06  JKarsrud: event doesn't bubble?
11:06  JKarsrud: I don't know
11:06  JKarsrud: Why would you have a button inside of an a element anyway?
11:07  progrock: blackspotwiggins: how about "can someone help me with this site... its not loading right in IE5.5"
11:07  blackspotwiggins: JKarsrud, styling reasons
11:07  blackspotwiggins: i could do <button><a>, but then it wouldnt work anywhere
11:08  JKarsrud: oh okay
11:08  doonie: wee 6 out of 33 ppl saved in chile
11:08  progrock: doonie: wasnt there like a fat one that wont fit through the hole.. did tthey solve that yet.. or starving him for another month?
11:08  doonie: hehe
11:08  doonie: no idea
11:09  blackspotwiggins: a miner cant be fat
11:09  progrock: I liek that they did a psych test onthem to maek sure they coudl handle being pulled through the hole (thse are miners stuck in a fuckign hole for months... )
11:09  BMCouto: Good morning, since paul_irish is not around, anyone using modernizr and testing on IE7?
11:09  progrock: I feel bad for Jorge, who needs Carlos to hold his hand when he goes to the corner to take a piss
11:10  doonie: ;p
11:12  JKarsrud: BMCouto: doesn't it work or something?
11:12  blackspotwiggins: ehhõ
11:12  blackspotwiggins: figured out my event issue
11:12  JKarsrud: allright?
11:12  blackspotwiggins: css3pie is not ready for use :)
11:12  JKarsrud: :D
11:12  blackspotwiggins: when it works, it's awesome
11:13  blackspotwiggins: but it works 15% of time
11:13  JKarsrud: :( :(
11:13  blackspotwiggins: and fucks up your events
11:13  JKarsrud: Then I'll stay the fuck away from that shit
11:14  progrock: I'm confused.. is promotJS trying to promotoe a good documentation before the documentation is written?
11:14  JKarsrud: Progressive enhancement will be for the ones using proper browsers

11:14  suunto: guys, i use the following line to get content for my tooltip: content: {text: jQuery(this).next('.hidden-content')}, but i want to get a div inside that like : tr.hidden-content td div.tooltip-details but then my tooltips dont work
11:15  blackspotwiggins: JKarsrud, it's very clever, but quite stable yet
11:15  blackspotwiggins: + it breaks in ie9
11:15  JKarsrud: Problem is, w3schools etc have been on the top of the list for too long with shitty tutorials etc, so we need one that works
11:15  pi3r: progrock, damn i try to launch nginx and "/var/run/nginx.pid" failed (2: No such file or directory) :/
11:15  JKarsrud: blackspotwiggins: Not surprising though
11:15  matt1982: is it possible to bind a change event to say a table cell? I want to know when a "total" cell changes so I can update other parts. Any ideas?
11:15  progrock: pi3r: most tutorials will show you how to make an nginx init script
11:15  JKarsrud: Meh, anyone have a good color scheme they can give me? This one is way too bright now
11:16  rrrreimer: hi everyone
11:16  pi3r: progrock, k, i'm switching to the nginx chan :D
11:16 --- kungfumaster is now known as kungfuninja
11:16  JKarsrud: matt1982: You could trigger your own event
11:16  rrrreimer: I'm wondering why jQuery does create the dom tree from xml but for some elements the "innerxml" is missing
11:16  BMCouto: JKarsrud yeah it's not working for some reason
11:16  matt1982: JKarsrud, hmm sounds interesting, Is there a function or something I can google to find out more?
11:17  JKarsrud: ?trigger
11:17  bot-t: .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
11:17  JKarsrud: $('#total').trigger('imChanged');
11:17  matt1982: ahh thanks for the tip JKarsrud
11:17  JKarsrud: then you can just bind to the event in some other part of the app, ie. the table or something
11:17  philsturgeon: Anybody here using jQuey Uniform and struggling with Checkbox click() events?
11:18  JKarsrud: I got my jquery uniform on right now
11:18  blackspotwiggins: JKarsrud, do you have stars?
11:18  philsturgeon: When I click the checkboxes, it's hitting <span class-"checked" not the checkbox, so any binded events fail
11:18  blackspotwiggins: man i wish i had stars
11:18  JKarsrud: too many
11:19  owzzz: hi, how can I check if an anchor element contains an attribute id of "something"
11:19  BMCouto: JKarsrud any idea why modernizr seems not to be working on IE7?
11:20  owzzz: im thinking something like: $("not sure what goes here":contains('SlideDeck_Bug')").remove();
11:20  owzzz: I want to remove the element from the page once found
11:21  progrock: owzzz: umm.. are ytou trying to remove an anchor of s specific ID?
11:21  owzzz: yeah..
11:21  owzzz: but Im only checking part of the id
11:21  progrock: $("#elementsID").  ....
11:21  progrock: oh, I see
11:21  progrock: so liek a if Id begins with ....
11:22  owzzz: the id has the same first part of it.. but the second part is generated
11:22  owzzz: on page load..
11:22  progrock: owzzz: well you can definitely do that.. but might I recommend using a seperate class instead (if you can)
11:22  rrrreimer: has anyone ever worked with xml+jquery?
11:22  JKarsrud: $('element[id^=something]')
11:22  owzzz: so I want to check for an anchor tag contains an id with part of it matched..
11:22  JKarsrud: but a class i recommended
11:23  owzzz: then remove it
11:23  owzzz: I'm not generating the element
11:23  progrock: owzzz: JKarsrud jaut showed you the regex for mathcing the start of an ID
11:23  JKarsrud: owzzz: That code I just posted looks at the id attribute of the element in question, that begins with "something"
11:23  owzzz: I see o.k.. I'l have a go with that
11:23  progrock: lol.. my typing is downgrading fast
11:24  JKarsrud: progrock: yeah, get off the shrooms dude
11:24  progrock: JKarsrud: haha..i dont waste my time with them anymore.. lucy all the way :)
11:24  owzzz: thank you
11:24  owzzz: that worked perfectly
11:24  JKarsrud: xD
11:24  JKarsrud: Man oh man
11:24  progrock: owzzz: regex's are some powerful beasts
11:25  JKarsrud: CSS X-Fire for phpstorm/webstorm is some serious hardcore effective shit

11:26  progrock: so I'm*
11:27  JKarsrud: Or did you actually mean "I want to bind the click event of an a element inside of .rubics"?
11:27  JKarsrud: Hah, nite nite progrock
11:27  mongag: Hm.. closest seems dosen`t work for me or i`m wrong somewhere
11:28  JKarsrud: mongag: Closest needs a selector
11:28  mongag: $('.rubrics').closests('a').click(function() {
11:28  JKarsrud: But is the a the parent of .rubics, or the other way around?
11:28  JKarsrud: dude, you've got an s to many there :)

11:34  suunto: i have rows like this <tr>stuff</tr><tr class="hidden-content">stuff</tr>

12:41  bl4ckspot: if you have to ask you are not ready to create your own plugins
12:42  mekwall: dinosaadeh, $(obj).children('div:first').slideToggle() ?
12:44  mekwall: dinosaadeh, or $('div:first', obj).slideToggle(); :P
12:45 --- temp0l is now known as matjas

12:45  mekwall: it's nice
12:45  fbjork: bl4ckspot: I am unescaping the output i'm returning though
12:50  lvtrii: Just a quick caveat on that mekwall, dinosaadeh
12:50  lvtrii: $(obj).children('div:first') != $('div:first', obj)
12:50  lvtrii: $('div:first', obj) == obj.find("div:first")
12:50  lvtrii: children is immediate children, find is any level
12:51  mekwall: lvtrii, that is true
12:51  mekwall: didn't really thing it would be a problem... but actually can be
12:51  lvtrii: Internally, $('div:first', obj) calls obj.find(), so it's just a matter of which syntax you prefer :)
12:52  lvtrii: Aye, in most cases it's not a problem
12:52  lvtrii: but you never know
12:52  mekwall: <span><div></div></span><div></div>
12:52  mekwall: that for example
12:53  mekwall: $('div:first', obj) will select the div inside the span, while $(obj).children('div:first') will select the div thats on the first level ;)
12:53  mekwall: lvtrii, I think it's a matter of using as few characters as possible ;)
12:53  fbjork: bl4ckspot: $(”#cart”).html(”<%= escape_javascript(render :partial => “cart”, :object => @cart) %>”);  that should work in Rails 3 i believe as well?

12:58  KRTac: i thought that would do the job, but this animation also stops with stop()
13:01  bl4ckspot: KRTac, as long as you are using jquery to animate, you can always stop() it

13:04  santiagoelf: question
13:04  santiagoelf: how can i call jquery on an asp.net server side event
13:04  santiagoelf: like a select command button in a gridview
13:05  santiagoelf: clicks select command button for row -> issues event server side -> server side calls some jquery method :/
13:05  KRTac: i need to set the opacity of elements, but I allso have a mouseover and mouseout event on the elements that can ocour when the opaciti animation is happening. so, I can't do it with vanilla jquery?
13:06  bl4ckspot: and you need unstoppable animation for.. ?
13:07  KRTac: bl4ckspot: ... the opacity animation.
13:07  bl4ckspot: ..
13:07  bl4ckspot: you are not helping
13:07  bl4ckspot: why does it have to be unstoppable?
13:09  doonie: power ;>
13:10  KRTac: becouse if I hover over a element while the opacity animation is running, the element is stuck with the opacity that was set at the time (the animation would have gone to opacity: 1, but it stopped at 0.77). I need the opacity animation to execute regardless
13:10  bl4ckspot: why does it stop
13:10  bl4ckspot: do you stop it?
13:12  darkangel_: How do you open a jQuery UI accordion section by selector?
13:12  KRTac: yes..stop(true) must execute on the mouseover and mouseout events becouse of obvious resons (the animations would queue)
13:13  bl4ckspot: so don't stop the animation
13:16  sqwk: What's the easiest was to check whether one of multiple selects, all with name foo[], has a value set?
13:16  KRTac: bl4ckspot: I alreadi sayd why I can't
13:16  KRTac: i must run stop(true) on the element on mouseover and mouseout
13:17  bl4ckspot: so you want to make animation unstoppable, which you have to stop for "obvious reasons"
13:17  bl4ckspot: can you see the conflict here?

13:18  temp01: pop porn
13:18  bl4ckspot: .pop() porn

13:19  SugaSlide: lol
13:19  SugaSlide: i still dont get the whole eval thing

13:21  `naes: stop this insanity
13:21  KRTac: bl4ckspot: the opacity animation is this: animate({opacity: fadeTo}, { duration: 300, queue: false })
13:21  bl4ckspot: but they are run one after another, no?
13:21  mekwall: KRTac, .stop(true, true) ?
13:21  KRTac: mekwall: no
13:22  mekwall: ?.stop @ KRTac

13:22  mekwall: jumpToEnd = jumpToEndA Boolean indicating whether to complete the current animation immediately.
13:22  KRTac: bot-t: i know
13:22  bot-t: KRTac, .click() - Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
13:22  mekwall: lol
13:22  bl4ckspot: KRTac, are your animations run ant the same time or not?

13:24  darkangel_: Can anyone invite me into #jquery-ui?
13:24  mekwall: why not just ask your question here?
13:24  darkangel_: mekwall: I did, no answer.
13:25  `naes: darkangel_, this is #jquery-ui
13:25  KRTac: bl4ckspot: i'm a pretty slow typer..sry...if the opacity animation is running when a mouseover event fires, the yes...i have multiple animations at the same time...that's also the problem. I want to be able to make the opacity animation unstopable, so when I run stop(true) I can stop the mouseover/mouseout animation but the opacity runs all the way
13:25  darkangel_: `naes: ?
13:25  mekwall: darkangel_, ask again...
13:25  `naes: ?down jsfiddle
13:25  bot-t: `naes, It's just you. - http://jsfiddle.com is up.
13:25  `naes: ?down jsfiddle.net
13:25  bl4ckspot: KRTac, afaik you cant have multiple animations on same element at the same time
13:25  bot-t: `naes, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
13:26  KRTac: bl4ckspot: i know..that's not the issue
13:26  `naes: stupid jsfiddle
13:26  mekwall: KRTac, why not just start a new opacity animation after .stop?
13:26  bl4ckspot: KRTac, so
13:26  bl4ckspot: you can cancel one
13:26  bl4ckspot: and the other still runs
13:26  darkangel_: mekwall: How do you open a jQuery UI accordion section by selector? It just seems to toggle if already open.
13:27  KRTac: bl4ckspot: "you can cancel one" how?
13:27  bl4ckspot: .stop() if it's running
13:27  bl4ckspot: without true
13:27  KRTac: but that stops all animations
13:27  bl4ckspot: no
13:27  mekwall: darkangel_, why do you need to do it by selector?
13:27  bl4ckspot: it stops the current one
13:27 --- `naes is now known as sean`
13:27  darkangel_: I tried:
13:27  darkangel_:     $('#x').accordion('activate', false);
13:27 --- sean` is now known as `naes
13:27  darkangel_:     $('#x').accordion('activate', '#y'); ... but it just remains all closed.
13:27  bl4ckspot: KRTac, These animations will not begin until the first one completes. When .stop() is called, the next animation in the queue begins immediately.
13:28  mekwall: darkangel_, it's becaue you need an index...
13:28  darkangel_: mekwall: Because that's the only way I can identify the correct section.
13:28  darkangel_: mekwall: Not true, you can use a selctor.
13:28  mekwall: darkangel_, $('#x').accordion('activate', $( '#y').index())
13:28  darkangel_: > selector
13:28  ultror:   Not in scope: `selector'
13:28  mekwall: ah right
13:29  dinosaadeh: guys, i am still doing this menu toggle function.. i have nested divs that show a tree.. i had my function at first on the div but this way the main div will respond to my click rather the inner divs
13:29  KRTac: bl4ckspot: jeah...right. but the opacity animation is the first one running...so that stops
13:29  dinosaadeh: i changed my logic to have the label of the div (just a link) to do the toggling
13:30  dinosaadeh: so i have <a href="javascript: toggleFunc(this)">label</a><div style="display: hidden"></div>
13:30  dinosaadeh: $(obj).next('div').slideToggle() is not doing a thing, not an error nor able to actually toggle
13:31  mekwall: dinosaadeh, that means it does not select it properly
13:31  mekwall: dinosaadeh, do a console.log on $(obj).next('div')
13:31  mekwall: see what you get
13:32  dinosaadeh: hehe, i did $('#21').next('div').slideToggle() and it is toggling!
13:32  mekwall: dinosaadeh, why do you have toggleFunc ?
13:33  KRTac: the opacity animation runs on a element with a duration of 200 ms. a mouseover event fires on the element  at about 50 ms of the running (opacity) animation. I run stop(true) (to clear the queue, becouse i dont want the mouseover/mouseout animation to queue), and by that I allso nuke the running (opacity) animation. I want to be able to run the opaciti animation regardless of the elements fx queue
13:33  dinosaadeh: ah, that was just a shortcut of naming
13:33  dinosaadeh: was abbreviating my problem
13:34  KRTac: so I don't stop the opacity animation with stop()
13:34  KRTac: i guess I'm asking if I could run a animation outsite the queue
13:38  KRTac: bl4ckspot: ?

13:43  rrrreimer: $$() is Mootools

13:48  dub54: perfect, thanks :)
13:48  rrrreimer: is it working?
13:48  dub54: yeah, element is an object so i put alert(element.name) and it worked fine
13:50  rrrreimer: you even could access that field by data[0].name
13:50  rrrreimer: data is an array which contains only one element
13:51  rrrreimer: and this element is an object where you access the fields by the dot notation or you use it as an associative array by using the field name as an index

14:16  SugaSlide: in afrikaans "dom" means stupid...
14:17  Lord_iMac: But it doesn't work on Reload if I remove the "disabled" from the Input Text Field (Checkbox is still checked after Reload - That's the Default). In this Case I need to uncheck and check the Checkbox to disable the Input Text Field.
14:17  Lord_iMac: I don't want to add "disabled" or "readonly" to the Text Field because if someone disabled his JavaScript this Input Field is not writeable. Is there any Way to modify the JavaScript Part that it works in any Case?

14:29  rrrreimer: dub54: just google for "jquery chain"
14:32  dub54: bit too confusing for me ha
14:32  Cork: dub54: the fade is async
14:33  Cork: dub54: so that is in the lines after it will be called BEFORE the animation is complete
14:33  Cork: the callback is called when its complete though, so everything you want to happen after its complete has to be inside its callback
14:34  dub54: but by the time the callback is called it would have already faded in?
14:34  Cork: dub54: yes, but your only running delay inside it
14:34  dub54: i mean, how can I put the fade in the callback if the callback is in the fade?
14:34  rrrreimer: dub54: I posted a link which describes how to execute the chain sequentially
14:35  Cork: dub54: you have to put the next fade inside the callback
14:35  dub54: Cork: but it's in an each statement? won't that just repeat it?
14:35  Cork: dub54: can you pastebin the complete each?

14:39  rrrreimer: it's working asynchronously as Cork already mentioned
14:39  rrrreimer: this means your method is not blocking until it's finished
14:39  dub54: it fades them all in at once
14:40  dub54: i want a second delay before each of them starts fading if that makes sense

14:46  mekwall: http://glesys.com
14:47  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, their highest data transfer is 10 000 GB per month, so I had to calculate how much mbit that is to have something to compare with hehe
14:47  blackspotwiggins: well
14:47  blackspotwiggins: that would mean constant load
14:48  mekwall: yeah exactly
14:48  mekwall: so if it is about 40mbit
14:48  mekwall: then it's enough :P
14:48  blackspotwiggins: it's not
14:48  blackspotwiggins: it's 5 mbit
14:48  mekwall: k
14:49  mekwall: but I don't necessarily need to host the content there
14:49  mekwall: could use a cdn for that
14:49  overdied: My default CSS style for a element is Display:NONE --- How do I make Jquery SHOW() that element inline by default?  It is setting it to Block.
14:49  blackspotwiggins: overdied, if the element is inline element, show() will display it as inline
14:50  overdied: it isn't, it is NONE
14:50  blackspotwiggins: thats css
14:50  blackspotwiggins: div is block
14:50  blackspotwiggins: span is inline
14:50  blackspotwiggins: for example
14:50  overdied: Oh, that makes sense
14:50  overdied: I understand, I will convert it to a span.  I thought it was refering to the display property
14:51  rrrreimer: ok, the javascript channel is very inactive at the moment, does anyone know if it's possible to let a json reference itself? http://pastebin.com/ue9xpJMi
14:51  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, 10 000 (gigabytes / month) = 3.8939154 MBps <-- that's what Google says
14:51  mekwall: and MBps is MB per second
14:51  blackspotwiggins: yeah around so
14:51  mekwall: not mbit
14:51  mekwall: that would mean it's like 8 times more
14:52  mekwall: 31 mbit
14:52  blackspotwiggins: 40 mbit would be 12840 gb/month
14:53  mekwall: so 31 mbit is about 10k :)
14:53  blackspotwiggins: possibly
14:53  mekwall: then it's more then enough for us

15:44 --- frigginSMoke is now known as frigginSmoke
15:44  Ziggy`: lathan: Line 13 doesn't work, since the event handler is for the elements in the beginning each children of #basedOnList, so the newest append is not considered a children of basedOnList in the event
15:44  lathan: Ziggy`, so you need to use the live click handler that I put above...
15:45  BMCouto: lathan you're used to use modernizr?
15:45  `naes: waddup with it
15:45  Ziggy`: lathan: For line 13 or on top ?
15:46  blackspotwiggins: BMCouto, you have been asking that for the entire day
15:46  blackspotwiggins: are you collecting stats or what?
15:46  lathan: Ziggy`, no, use live instead of the click handler
15:46  lathan: BMCouto, no

15:46  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins i ask that 4 ou 5 times already and noone answered, so if you have nothing productive to say, please just don't
15:46  BMCouto: lathan ok thanks

15:47  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins where do you call it? on the <head>?
15:47  blackspotwiggins: yeah
15:47  blackspotwiggins: it's reasonably fast
15:47  BMCouto: because i find weird that calling it at the bottom of the file doesn't work
15:47  blackspotwiggins: hmm
15:47  blackspotwiggins: haven't tried at the bottom myself
15:48  BMCouto: can you?

15:49  BMCouto: i load them at the bottom

15:50  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins it does?
15:50  lathan: madam I'm adam
15:51  BMCouto: on IE7?
15:51  blackspotwiggins: didnt try on ie
15:51  blackspotwiggins: i dont have ie7 anyway
15:51  blackspotwiggins: but i imagine it would not be any different
15:51  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins where did you try it?
15:51  BMCouto: on recent browser you wont see it
15:51  blackspotwiggins: at my local project
15:51  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins it is
15:51  blackspotwiggins: meh
15:51  lukasvlcek: I have some doubts about possibility to catch a correct status code status text for ajax call. For example if I do ajax query to URL that does not exist, that it is quite tricky to catch the error. Moreover, it seems that depending on used browser (thus xhr implementation) the status code and status text may or may not be correct in this case.
15:51  blackspotwiggins: ok i'll boot up my vm for you
15:52  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins thanks
15:52  BMCouto: i called modernizr at the bottom, then went to ie7 and everything was messed up
15:52  `naes: <script src="modernizr.js"></script><script>console.log (Modernizr.input.placeholder);</script>
15:52  `naes: works perfectly
15:52  BMCouto: i couldnt believe it so i called it at the ehad, and everything went back normal again
15:52  Ziggy`: lathan: Does not work.
15:53  `naes: IE8 also
15:53  blackspotwiggins: lukasvlcek, i've had huge issues with webkits regarding xhr objects
15:53  BMCouto: sean change your nick and where are you tryibng that?
15:53  lathan: Ziggy`, are you saying that my example didn't work for you?
15:53  `naes: locally
15:53  BMCouto: yeah but in the jead?
15:53 --- frigginSmoke is now known as seutje
15:53  BMCouto: *head
15:53  Ziggy`: Since the $('basedOnList').children.each .. builds everything on document ready .. and binds a "click" handler for it, I need the $('#basedOnList').children().each loop to be live.
15:53  `naes: before closing body
15:54  BMCouto: sean thats not the problem
15:54  lathan: Ziggy`, did you look at my example! http://jsfiddle.net/Whdq7/
15:54  BMCouto: thoose things work weel
15:54  `naes: oke
15:54  BMCouto: but the elements dont get inserted in the bottom
15:54  BMCouto: in the DOM
15:54  BMCouto: whats wrong with me today
15:54  lukasvlcek: blackspotwiggins: I found out that if I do call URL that does not exist, then I can be save to catch the error in complete fonction, not in error function (because Firefox does not enter error function, it drops into success....)
15:54  `naes: which els
15:54  `naes: elements
15:54  `naes: pastebin
15:54  `naes: or give link
15:54  blackspotwiggins: BMCouto, yes works fine for me
15:54  lukasvlcek: s/save/safe/
15:54  BMCouto: html5 els, section header etc
15:54  blackspotwiggins: ie7 mode on ie9
15:55  `naes: oh
15:56  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins it recognizes the html5 elms?
15:56  blackspotwiggins: pardon?
15:56  BMCouto: ie9 will render them up
15:56  lathan: lukasvlcek, can your return html have a code for success? and look in the data for that?
15:56  BMCouto: if you have an html5 structure with sections articles whatever and call modernizr on the bottom everything is ok on ie7?
15:56  blackspotwiggins: and this is related modernizr how?
15:56  BMCouto: i dont believe so
15:56  blackspotwiggins: yeah it works fine for me
15:56  BMCouto: because modernizr creates thoose elems
15:56  blackspotwiggins: i only have <footer>
15:56  BMCouto: and inserts them into the dom
15:56  blackspotwiggins: modernir doesnt create anything
15:56  blackspotwiggins: it only detects support
15:56  BMCouto: wrong
15:57  BMCouto: Lastly, Modernizr also adds support for styling and printing HTML5 elements. This allows you to use more semantic, forward-looking elements such as <section>, <header> and <dialog> without having to worry about them not working in Internet Explorer.
15:57  corte: hey guys, i'm having a hell of a time accessing the JSON result of an AJAX query--i'm getting "undefined" (http://pastebin.com/GXfqAPJ2)..any help would be greatly appreciated
15:57  blackspotwiggins: ok, i use html5 shiv for that
15:57  Ziggy`: lathan: Sorry I was doing it wrong, your example works completely.
15:57  corte: oh and i know for a fact that the JSON is being returned & in proper format
15:57  Ziggy`: lathan: Thanks alot for the help
15:57  blackspotwiggins: that part has to be in <head> definitely
15:57  BMCouto: blackspotwiggins modernizr does it all
15:57  lathan: np Ziggy`
15:57  BMCouto: yeah that's my point
15:57  BMCouto: so i cant call it on the bottom
15:58  BMCouto: that sucks!
15:58  lukasvlcek: I am not sure I understand. How can I learn that ajax call was not successful and what is the status code?
15:58  blackspotwiggins: modernizr still works
15:58  `naes: you suck :p

22:10  eTiger13: khinester: use google for jquery and jqueryui and download the the css to your server
22:10  zay2: well the data is tabular. there could be rows and rows of this data

22:49  JKarsrud: Anyone done some work with it?
22:51  dev2: has anybody used nested tabs?  Did you find it worked smoothly from the user perspective?
22:51  dev2: (jqui tabs)
22:53  sean`: dev2, yup
22:53  sean`: even ajax loaded ones
22:53  sean`: imo, there are better solutions
22:53  dev2: I'm talking 5+ tabs each with 5-10 tabs inside
22:54  dev2: sean` , I'd love to hear about better solutions to this, or at least alternative..  thoughts?
22:55  sean`: dev2, ask yourself what kind of content you need to publish
22:55  chovy: given a jquery nodeList, how do I get the position of an item in the list?
22:55  [KS]: index()
22:55  JKarsrud: index
22:55  sean`: also, styling is the biggest part
22:55  sean`: you can use several nested tabs, as long as you style them properly
22:55  monk12: hello all, i have css like so ... .sf-menu li li.sfHover > a{color:red;} ... Now since IE6 doesn't support child > selector, i was going to use jquery to target IE6... but $('.sf-menu li li.sfHover > a').css('color','red'); doesnt work in my document.ready... the reason *I think* is sfHover is dynamic and shows up later while u are on the webpage. anyway to make it always look for the update to DOM to update css?
22:55  JKarsrud: dammit [KS]! :P
22:55  sean`: so the user doesn't think of them as the same
22:55 * [KS] rulZ
22:55  [KS]: :D
22:55  monk12: I thought .live() function, but that seems to be called on an event like click.
22:56  sean`: monk12, no
22:56  sean`: livequery can do that
22:56  sean`: but you can also just do it in CSS
22:56  JKarsrud: monk12: Do you HAVE TO use > ?
22:56  sean`: or generaet a style tag on the fly
22:56  JKarsrud: do you need to target the a as the immediate child?
22:56  dev2: sean`, its more for administering  a complex web of content that is the website.  Its not necessary to have more than one parent table, so I really could just have a single group of 5-10 tabs..  but for convenience
22:57  sean`: dev2, this is more a UI questino, which can't be solved by text alone
22:57  monk12: easiest way to do with the SuperFish css i had... if i did ".sel1 .sel2" and ".sel1 * .sel2", specificality rules overruled it. had trouble seeing hwere. so i gave them !important ... and still something was overriding lol. so i thought about just using plain ole jquery.
22:57  sean`: howeveazz, I'm gonna go to slizzeep
22:57  sean`: monk12, you can do body class="ie6"
22:57  dev2: sean`, so you mean screenshots or a working demo
22:57  sean`: .ie6 element color: red
22:58  chovy: kkmaybe there is an easier way to provide a "back" button for an iframe history below it.
22:58  TheIronSky: can I set a class to a variable?
22:58  sean`: but if you really need child selector, then you should add a class to them
22:58  dev2: sean`, would make it easier to suggest how I approach it
22:58  sean`: hyup
22:58  eTiger13: TheIronSky:  class as in css class or object class?
22:58  TheIronSky: css...
22:59  TheIronSky: but let me explain
22:59  monk12: can I do an IE conditional comment to put something like <div class="regular_class <!--[if IE 6]>ie6<![endif]-->">   ?
22:59  TheIronSky: if I have 4 elements with the classes 1, 2, 3, 4... and so on, can I create a function that adds one to a variable to switch to the next class?
22:59  JKarsrud: monk12: no
22:59  sean`: monk12, use js to add it
23:00  sean`: or just do it by default, which is nicer
23:00  [KS]: monk but you can include other css file conditionally which redeclares the same file
23:00  JKarsrud: but the question here really is: Do you NEED the child selector?
23:00  [KS]: same class, even
23:00  JKarsrud: can't ".sfHover a { color: red; }" solve the problem?
23:00  sanguisleft: could some on help me sort out why my bloody click.append is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/sanguis/7YWZQ/8/
23:01  JKarsrud: Do you have more than one a inside .sfHover and need to get the immediate child a?
23:01  TheIronSky: if I have 4 elements with the classes 1, 2, 3, 4... and so on, can I create a function that adds one to a variable to switch to the next class?
23:01  TheIronSky: oops
23:01  TheIronSky: why did I re-ask..?
23:02  monk12: nah. i can show u the css hehe. I couldnt thinmk of easier way...  http://www.arianhojat.com/temp/code/css/superfish/index.htm ... The 2nd/3rd tier menus color changes back to white which looks ugly when the sfHover background of those selected items remains the light color.
23:02  [KS]: sanguisleft: because your #mapIt is set to display: none?
23:02  monk12: .sf-menu li li.sfHover > a{color:#37125F;} fixes issue. but not sure how to do it otherwise.
23:03  JKarsrud: .sf-menu li li.sfHover a ?
23:03  JKarsrud: Does that work?
23:03  sanguisleft: oi vey
23:03  JKarsrud: answer my question
23:03  JKarsrud: [KS]: Good catch, didn't spot that one :P
23:03  [KS]: ha
23:03  [KS]: someone please stop me :))
23:03  JKarsrud: too focused on markup and js to see the css :P

23:05  monk12: JKarsrud, the superfish css has alot of rules... the ".sfHover a { color: red; }" i am pretty sure won't solve it as something else will override. I tried many things, but I can give it a shot though as don't want to look too arrigant.
23:05  sanguisleft: [KS]: oh yeah was going to toggle the data at one point
23:05  monk12: one sec.
23:05  JKarsrud: monk12: No, I was just asking WHY you used the child selector?
23:05  [KS]: missed that part tho :)
23:05  john2496: hey, just got DC'd, not sure if this went through..

23:07  JKarsrud: monk12: Can you change the markup to use a class?
23:07  HarryPitfall: thickbox is... so easy...
23:07  JKarsrud: That would overwrite the styles from sugarfish
23:07  JKarsrud: But
23:07  JKarsrud: Why don't you just change the sugarfish css itself?
23:07  HarryPitfall: I'm using mbGallery to show slides... I didn't know thickbox
23:07  JKarsrud: Instead of copying styles to overwride them yourself
23:08  john2496: JKarsrud & lathan: thanks, are there any reliable workarounds that add FF compatibility?
23:09  lathan: john2496, I don't think you get it, Firefox does NOT support it, and its not easy to go around...
23:09  bot-t: (55 secs ago) <lathan> tell lathan Hi
23:10  monk12: JKarsrud,   I am modifying the super/suckerfish css ... I changed a few rules and added some... You see, their default rules make it so the color of the subnavigation text works out... since the background colors aren't extremely dark or light. the main color works... but i am using dark purple and very light purple, so I had to add some rules.  but it doesnt work out in that scenario of going down into 3rd list. Their rules are already a lil' complicated and
23:10  monk12:  it overwrites my rules...

23:12  monk12: JKarsrud, thats a good idea. I can modify my menu. so add a class and see if can make it so has highest specificality?
23:12  JKarsrud: Jah
23:13  ManxPower: It seems to me that window.parent.$ would work.
23:13  monk12: I can do that :). thanks JKarsrud. I was just hoping i could just make some sort of super rule in the css :).
23:13  monk12: #god_rule{ do_what_I_want: 'true'; }

23:16  lathan: ManxPower, window.top if you're in an external js file

23:48  lathan: BMCouto, is colorbox a global variable? or a function parameter?
23:49  lathan: BMCouto, or not defined....
23:49  amouge: ?anyone @ myself
23:49  bot-t: myself, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
23:49  BMCouto: lathan: colorbox is the function that i'm loading in the ajax()
23:49  BMCouto: so basically i want him to call the js if its not there, and next time since its already loaded just jump to the else
23:50  lathan: BMCouto, well, where are you setting the loaded script to be called colorbox?
23:52  BMCouto: lathan its a modal window plugin
23:52  BMCouto: a known one
23:52  BMCouto: http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
23:53  lathan: BMCouto, how is the colorbox variable supposed to be defined?
23:53 --- gilesgoatboy is now known as gilesgoatboy|awa
23:55  BMCouto: what do you mean supposed to be defined?
23:55  BMCouto: yeah i just $(selector).colorbox();
23:55  BMCouto: *use
23:56  lathan: so does the script actually set window.colorbox? or is it being a plugin and using $.fn.colorbox?
23:57  BMCouto: should i paste the plugin for you?
23:57  BMCouto: i just assumed that if the function colorbox is there then...
23:57  lathan: BMCouto, try checking $.fn.colorbox instead...
23:57  BMCouto: its minified
23:57  lathan: $().colorbox !== colorbox
23:57  lathan: $().colorbox = $.fn.colorbox
23:57  lathan: *==
23:58  BMCouto: where?
23:58  BMCouto: didn't get that part

23:58  lathan: to add functions to jquery like that you add them to $.fn
23:58  lathan: you can't just set a function blah(){...} and then do $('div').blah()
23:58  lathan: you do $.fn.blah = function(){...}, then $('div').blah
23:58  lathan: ()
23:59  BMCouto: lathan: yes its there just in the beggining
23:59  BMCouto: http://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox/blob/master/colorbox/jquery.colorbox.js
23:59  lathan: BMCouto, does ajaxing in a script, mean the jQuery adds it to the page?
23:59  lathan: and runs it?
23:59  BMCouto: thats my doubt
