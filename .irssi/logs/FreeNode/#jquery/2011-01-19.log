00:08 * initself tries the debug feature in the plugin
00:08  coachz: what is the correct way to specify that any  element.style { z-index: 1002; }    in my #mydiv  should have z-index: 2000;
00:09  vacho: jinxdone2: qtip is cool, but lacks documentation
00:09  vacho: jinxdone2: there is not a single example I can download and play with..when u view the source it only gives the jquery..and not html
00:09  coachz: like this?   #statusdialog.element.style{z-index:2000;}
00:09  initself: don't know what debug does! :)
00:09  vacho: jinxdone2: and there is no examples where they are using both img and text
00:09  initself: here are the docs: http://www.programmers.org/index.php/2009/12/jquery-google-suggest-jquerygsuggestjs/

00:10  jinxdone2: vacho it's available at github
00:10  jinxdone2: you should go for qtip2, forget the first one at this point
00:10  Doddlin: what is idx?
00:11  vacho: jinxdone2: im at the qtip2 site now..trying to find an example with both text and image..solid markup
00:13  seanbrant: using autocomplete the results close when i click the scroll bar
00:14  khmer: initself: is your service supposed to be returning jsonp?
00:14  initself: ya, but not at the moment
00:14  initself: let me get it back
00:14  initself: khmer: there
00:14  jinxdone2: vacho, there should be plenty of examples at the qtip2 site
00:14  initself: firebug shows it returning ["Alec","Brian","Mike"]
00:14 --- necromancer`bzzy is now known as necromancer
00:15  initself: maybe that's not proper syntax
00:15  disappearedng: Hey you guys know any good matrix kind of selector (like the facebook matrix that shows who's online) plugin for jquery
00:16  BillCriswell: disappearedng: I think that's just straight HTML and CSS...
00:16  vacho: jinxdone2: then show me one:)
00:17  jinxdone2: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#tips
00:17  jinxdone2: click "view source"..
00:17  temp01: initself: that's not jsonp. the request expects jsonp
00:17  vacho: jinxdone2: i click viewsource and it shows me an empty page.
00:17  temp01: initself: it needs to be in format "callbackname(["Alec", "etc"])"

00:24  bananasontoast: Hey guys, quick question. When using jQueryUI Sortable's serialize function, is there an easy way to just alert the text?
00:24  coachz: how can i override DIALOG's z-index.  it has this being applied that is overriding me  element.style { z-index: 1002; }
00:25  BinaryKitten: bananasontoast what text
00:25  bananasontoast: The string that is generated by serialize?
00:25  coachz: or it could be the jqGrid that is adding that to the dialog,  i don't know wtf it's coming from
00:25  bananasontoast: Or am I getting this wrong?
00:26  BinaryKitten: var myText = xxxxxx.serialize(); alert(myText) ?
00:27  bananasontoast: BinaryKitten: Hmm, alerts a blank box, which is what it was doing before....
00:28  bananasontoast: BinaryKitten: This is what I had, but it doesn't seem right for some reason... var order = $(".span-16").sortable("serialize"); alert(order);
00:29  BinaryKitten: .span-16?
00:29  bananasontoast: Well that is the sortable element, it's just the class of a div

00:39  BinaryKitten: ck
00:39  BinaryKitten: coachz is that the direct copy/paste?
00:39  Fernandos: hi
00:39 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 96 seconds
00:39  coachz: $("#statusdialog").load("docfeedback/status.php?action=<?=r3e('status')?>&webdocumentid=" + webdocumentid ).dialog({width: 750, height: 625, position: 'center'}).css("z-index", 2000);
00:40  coachz: in firebug, element.style has z-index of 1002
00:40  coachz: so i need to make my dialog higher than that to override it
00:40  BinaryKitten: try as a string
00:41  coachz: ahh
00:41  BinaryKitten: .css("z-index","2000")
00:41  BinaryKitten: and if that doesn't work
00:41  Ziggy`: BinaryKitten: I want to be able to work with panels and such in jQuery, I'd like a similar framework.
00:41  BinaryKitten: .css("z-index","2000 !important")
00:41  Ziggy`: framework/library ..
00:41  BinaryKitten: Ziggy`  extJS works with jQuery
00:41  BinaryKitten: has a connector
00:42  Ziggy`: BinaryKitten: It's license does not work for me.
00:42  coachz: nope.    						$("#statusdialog").load("docfeedback/status.php?action=<?=r3e('status')?>&webdocumentid=" + webdocumentid ).dialog({width: 750, height: 625, position: 'center'}).css("z-index", "2000 !important");
00:42  BinaryKitten: then that is a different issue
00:42  Doddlin: anyone here using coda?
00:43  Ziggy`: BinaryKitten: Although I've heard great things, but I can't use it in my way.
00:43  Guest24253: looks like quotes issue
00:43  coachz: in firebug, element.style has z-index of 1002
00:43  Ziggy`: BinaryKitten: They have an absurd license.
00:43  BinaryKitten: Ziggy` fair enough..
00:43  coachz: when i make it a higher number in firebug the dialog pops up
00:43  coachz: above the other one
00:43  Ziggy`: BinaryKitten: Now any other like jQuery desktop based?
00:43  Ziggy`: Know*
00:43  BinaryKitten: coachz  if that the only bit on of element.style?
00:43  bananasontoast: Hey guys, i've just thrown some code on jsFiddle and hoping you guys can help? http://jsfiddle.net/t47wU/ Everything is working fine, however I want to to serialise the positions of the elements into a JSON packet and alert the packet to the screen. Can anyone possibly offer some help/advice for this?
00:44  BinaryKitten: Ziggy` all i will do is google for an answer for you
00:44  coachz: http://fpaste.org/uNHO/
00:45  bananasontoast: Sorry guys - updated... http://jsfiddle.net/t47wU/1/
00:46  coachz: when i change z-index to 1010 it pops above the other dialog
00:48  BinaryKitten: coachz no clue sorry
00:48  coachz: ok, this sucks
00:48  coachz: i open one dialog and it get z-index 1008
00:48  coachz: and the 2nd one opens with 1002
00:48  coachz: wtf ?
00:48  coachz: this element.style crap sucks
00:49  BinaryKitten: element.style = inline styles
00:49  jinxdone2: coachz i think that's the dialogs stack option working
00:49  coachz: and ?
00:49  BinaryKitten: check the dialog options for a way to overwride it
00:49  coachz: stack didn't work here
00:49  jinxdone2: yes but that's what's setting the z-index for you
00:49  coachz: i set the first one  stack: false and the 2nd stack: true and no change
00:49  jinxdone2: just make a css rule with z-index: 9999 for the second dialog? problem solved
00:50  coachz: jinxdone2,  didn't work, been there done that
00:50  coachz: 	#statusdialog{z-index: 2000 !important; }
00:50  coachz: did not work
00:50  coachz: that element-style bs is overriding me
00:51  jinxdone2: no the !important should override even that
00:52  jinxdone2: are you sure you didn't have a typo in there somewhere?
00:52  coachz: yeah
00:53  coachz: #statusdialog{z-index: 9999 !important; }   still pops up behind my first dialog
00:53  Doddlin: guys
00:54  initself: now i can't get it to display because of css
00:54  bananasontoast: coachz: Why are you z-indexes so high. I often find if I work within the range of 1-100 I get more predictable results. Also, it seems this might be a better question if you put a full example of what is happening on jsfiddle.net and possibly more relevant for #css
00:54  coachz: element.style is setting them at 1008,  anything higher should do it but doesn't
00:54  Doddlin: some tweaking is needed, why is the link called "Kollektion" not clickable if "Produkter" is clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/ubfrV/6/
00:54  coachz: jsfiddle is over my head
00:54  Doddlin: i have to "GO BACK" to be able to click on Produkter for instance
00:54  jinxdone2: coachz, make sure the element the dialog is in also has higher z-index than the dialog
00:55  jinxdone2: if a parent element has lower z-index that effects all its children
00:55  coachz: which element
00:55  jinxdone2: whatever is up the dom tree
00:55  coachz: i'm setting it on the div that defines the dialog
00:55  coachz: 	<div id="statusdialog"></div>
00:55  jinxdone2: yes but where is the dialog in the dom tree?
00:55  jinxdone2: in body?
00:56  jinxdone2: somewhere else?
00:56  coachz: yeah in body
00:57  coachz: an i create the 2nd dialog with this:    $("#statusdialog").load("docfeedback/status.php?action=<?=r3e('status')?>&webdocumentid=" + webdocumentid ).dialog({width: 750, height: 625, position: 'center'});
00:57  coachz: but the css doesn't force it to popup above the first dialog that has z-index of 1008 from that element.style crap
00:58  coachz: and in my css i set:     	#statusdialog{z-index: 9999 !important; }
00:58  coachz: i hate css
00:58  jinxdone2: take a look at the dom tree.. the #statusdialog is actually a couple of divs into the dialog
00:59  jinxdone2: it might not be the element that's setting the z-index
00:59  coachz: good idea, thanks jinxdone2     i'm going nuts

01:05  coachz: ahhh
01:06  coachz: no change,  grr

01:29  coachz: righto

01:31  coachz: but revenge is not :-)
01:31  ScottO_: that makes you a psychopath
01:31  coachz: i already knew that
01:32  jastor: ScottO_: there are more requirements than that to label anyone a psychopath
01:32  coachz: darn, i was hoping for time off
01:32  timmywil: bananasontoast: If serialize returns an empty string, make sure the id attributes include an underscore. They must be in the form: "set_number" For example, a 3 element list with id attributes foo_1, foo_5, foo_2 will serialize to foo[]=1&foo[]=5&foo[]=2. You can use an underscore, equal sign or hyphen to separate the set and number. For example foo=1 or foo-1 or foo_1 all serialize to foo[]=1.
01:32  timmywil: you don't have ids on your elements
01:33  timmywil: so serialize aint doin diddly.  you can do other attributes with options.

01:49  timmywil: andornaut: treat it just like a string variable, when you pass it to jQuery it will parse it then
01:49  timmywil: ah it returns an element
01:50  timmywil: in that case, use an array
01:50  andornaut: yeah :-/
01:50  timmywil: you can also pass jQuery arrays of elements
01:50  timmywil: .append(my_array_of_lis)
01:50  andornaut: ah, thanks for the tip
01:50  timmywil: np
01:51  coachz: weird  stack is now working.....hmmm
01:52  coachz: ahh, first dialog is no longer modal
01:52  klj613-: what is the best way to get all the values of all input[name='fileId'] and put them in a js array?
01:53  erichynds: klj613-, map()
01:53  klj613-: ty
01:53  coachz: so if dialog 1 is modal:true and dialog 2 is modal: true, then stack:false on dialog 1 doesn't work if stack:true is on dialog 2
01:53  coachz: set dialog1 to modal:false and stack works
01:54  klj613-: erichynds: im looking at a example of map() and i dont quite understand it
01:55  coachz: can i change the property of a dialog from modal:true to modal:false ?
01:55  erichynds: var values = $("input[name='field']").map(function(){ return this.value; }).get()
01:55  erichynds: klj613- ^
01:55  klj613-: ty.
01:57  timmywil: I know .get() is in the example, but why the .get()?  doesn't map already return an array?
01:58  coachz: timmywil,   can i change modal: true to modal: false on a dialog that already exists ?
01:58  erichynds: it grabs the array out of the jquery object, timmywil
01:58  erichynds: otherwise you'll have an array wrapped in a jq object
01:58  timmywil: but that's already been done
01:58  erichynds: unless of course you use $.map instead of $.fn.map

02:07  initself: i'm using a plugin that does some ajax
02:07  initself: i am finding that sometimes one request lags behind another
02:07  coachz: i'm loading another page in a dialog box (#statusdialog), is it possible to change the first dialog box (#statusdialog)  from modal: true to modal: false  FROM the page that is inside it ?  $("#statusdialog").load("docfeedback/status.php).dialog({modal:true, stack:false});
02:07  initself: can i cancel any pending requests when a new one is sent?
02:08  rainabba: I'm working on an ASP.Net project that implements the ajaxToolKit and I use jQuery. On my masterPage I have a Panel defined with only an asp:UpdateProgress in it and then I use an ajaxToolKit:ModalPopupExtender against it. Then using js to handle beginReq(sender, args) and endReq(sender, args), I .show() and .hide() so in theory, every postback should result in a progress modal. It only shows
02:08  rainabba: up on some pages and I can't see the pattern. Anyone know a better way to automagically get things done?
02:15  coachz: anyone ?
02:18  coldhead: coachz: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-option
02:19  apollo9: Does anyone have a good use case for .delegate() over .live() ?
02:19  coachz: coldhead,  i read taht already
02:19  coachz: i'm loading another page in a dialog box (#statusdialog), is it possible to change the first dialog box (#statusdialog)  from modal: true to modal: false  FROM the page that is inside it ?  $("#statusdialog").load("docfeedback/status.php).dialog({modal:true, stack:false});
02:19  timmywil: coachz: so you want to change the first modal to modal false when the second loads?
02:20  coachz: yes
02:20  coldhead: apollo9: i have some girl telling me delegate is more "performant"
02:20  timmywil: put it in the load callback
02:20  coachz: and change it back when 2nd closes
02:20  timmywil: bind to the close button
02:20  coachz: i'm currently calling the 2nd dialog from a jqGrid onselectrow event
02:21  timmywil: well, you could put it there too, but you might want to wait until the ajax request is finished
02:21  coldhead: you patient soul, timmywil
02:21  apollo9: Thanks coldhead , that's what I was wondering. Micro perf, or is it worth using over .live()?
02:22  coldhead: apollo9: i think it matters if you have a lot of elements
02:22  coachz: you are all very patient
02:22  coldhead: otherwise it's much of a muchness
02:22  coldhead: but people i respect say delegate is the future
02:22  coldhead: so i'm looking for a new career
02:22  coldhead: does anyone need a logician?
02:22  timmywil: gotta run, peace yall
02:22  apollo9: I have heard some of the major js pimps say use .delegate as well.
02:22  timmywil: thx coldhead
02:22  coldhead: or will anyone need a logician in 3 years once i'm qualified as one?

02:51  Psychokinesics: Hi just wondering if anyone could help me with a little problem I'm experiencing with jquery
02:51  coldhead: can you be more specific about the little problem
02:53  Psychokinesics: I've explained it clearly here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4730215/call-to-a-controller-inside-a-javascript-function
02:54  Psychokinesics: I basically have a php variable which stores an id.. and trying to add it to the end of a url in a javascript function
02:55  Psychokinesics: id is basically id (number) from a table in my database
02:57  Ooter: psychokinesics: the answer on stackoverflow seems fine, no?
02:58  cambazz: hello, when using the jqueryui autocomplete functionality, when autocomplete finds something it ignores enter to submit.
02:58  cambazz: when it can not find anything, enter submits.
02:58  Psychokinesics: Ooter: I'm quite lost with that answer on stack overflow
02:59  Psychokinesics: I've done the first part which is <td data-message-id="<?php echo $row['id']; ?>">
03:00  Ooter: ok so you have an element on your page that is like <td data-message-id="1234"></td> or something yeah?
03:00  Psychokinesics: but now quite confused when it comes to adding that id from the variable to the end of the URL in the javascript function
03:01  Ooter: in your javascript function - are you able to reference that td element?
03:01 * coldhead np: matmos - last delicious cigarette
03:01  Ooter: via some sort of jquery selector? does it have an id or something you can use to grab it?
03:02  skiz: Psychokinesics: concat the value of that data to the end. viola
03:02  Psychokinesics: Do I store this $(this).closest('tr').attr('data-message-id') in something then concatenate with +
03:02  skiz: why store it?
03:02  Ooter: you don't need to store it it
03:03  Ooter: that will return the id value
03:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o paul_irish]
03:03  Ooter: as skiz said - just concatenate it to your url
03:03 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o coldhead]
03:03  skiz: $.post(url + $(this).closest(....
03:03  Psychokinesics:      $.post('<?php echo base_url()?>'+$(this).closest('tr').attr('data-message-id'));
03:03  Psychokinesics: like this?
03:04  skiz: I cry when I see php in js
03:04  Ooter: skiz: same haha
03:04  Psychokinesics: lol
03:04 @paul_irish: +1
03:04  skiz: and baby jesus kills a kitten or something
03:04  skiz: o_O
03:04 @paul_irish: WWJD? murder cats.
03:05  Psychokinesics: Ooter: When I view source my URL shows but at the end of it is      $(this).closest('tr').attr('data-message-id');
03:05  Psychokinesics: I thought it would return the actual id
03:05  Psychokinesics: just like in PHP
03:06  Ooter: the id is attached to the td
03:06  skiz: it will.. it will look like  '/basepath' + $.js
03:06  skiz: it will be evaluated at post time
03:06  Ooter: ^^ this
03:06  littulb_: question.... how do you append/follow an animation with another animation???
03:06  skiz: littulb_: event queues
03:06  skiz: ?queue
03:06  bot-t: .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
03:06  Psychokinesics: Because I click to check the checkbox and it seems to have no effect
03:07  Psychokinesics: Would firebug for firefox have something that will show me what happens when I click the jquery checkbox?
03:07 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
03:07  skiz: Psychokinesics: watch your console, use console.log('xxx') for debugging, and verify everything you want is correct.  try one thing at a time and slowly build it, then refactor it once it's working.
03:08  skiz: Psychokinesics: yeah show XHR requests
03:08  skiz: well off to home with me..
03:08  skiz: see ya
03:08  Psychokinesics: Yep I see that post is going to a page that doesn't exist
03:09  Psychokinesics: well it has my url then /undefined at the end of it
03:09  Ooter: ok - so that selector is no good then
03:10 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
03:10  Ooter: you could put the id as an attribute of the checkbox, then you can juse say $(this).attr('data-message-id')
03:12  Psychokinesics: yep that worked perfectly
03:13  Ooter: cool
03:13  Psychokinesics: Thanks alot
03:13  Psychokinesics: very helpful. Appreciated
03:14  Psychokinesics: I think I have to put extra time into javascript
03:18 @coldhead: well worth doing so, Psychokinesics
03:18 @coldhead: it has some very elegant features
03:18 @coldhead: Ooter++
03:18  Psychokinesics: When i click this checkbox it only registers it when I uncheck it
03:19  Psychokinesics: and i actually need it to register the click and process the URL as soon as the check box is checked
03:22  m0nkfish: i need to get the value of a form control (<input type="text">) with id #nameFilter
03:22  m0nkfish: $("#nameFilter").val() isn't working
03:22  m0nkfish: what am i doing wrong?
03:24 @coldhead: OH SWEET I HAVE OPS
03:24 @coldhead: I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL
03:24 @coldhead: Psychokinesics: are you using click() or change() ?
03:26  Psychokinesics: neither
03:26  Psychokinesics: afterCheck: function(isChecked) {  if (isChecked) {  //do something here  }
03:27 @coldhead: can you link us Psychokinesics

03:31  Jee: Hi, I created multiple instances of a jQuery UI dialog. I use the .load() function to load internal files into the dialogs and I want to append a link in the dialog title bar to open the content in a new window: $("#ui-dialog-title-dialog_2").append('<a href="inc/twitterstream.html" target="_blank">Open in new window</a>'); but that doesn't work though if I append this to the body of my html file it works. It just doesn't work with dialogs
03:34 @paul_irish: bananananas
03:34  bananasontoast: paul_irish: moi?
03:35  draginx: How do I make something draggable and then have it remember the position of where the person dragged it?
03:36 @paul_irish: toastsss
03:37  mattalexx: draginx, Look at the docs for Draggable
03:37 @coldhead: Psychokinesics: pastie.org/1475993
03:37  draginx: mattalexx: nothign in there besides stop: function( .. do the work myself; }
03:38 @coldhead: i think your needs go beyond the simple provisions of simpleImageCheck >:\
03:38  mattalexx: draginx, So ... do the work yo self ;-)
03:38  draginx: well i have the CSS positioning the div
03:38  draginx: hmm
03:38  draginx: nvm
03:38  mattalexx: You get the cooredinates, isn't that what you're talking about any way?
03:38  draginx: does jquery not have a $.cookie? only plugins?
03:39  mattalexx: draginx, Only the cookie plugin
03:39  draginx: wow real bad
03:39  draginx: ok so ui.position gives me top and left
03:41  Psychokinesics: Ok it's working when I changed (isChecked) to (!isChecked)
03:43 @coldhead: that's easier than my fix, good work Psychokinesics
03:43  Ooter: make sure you comment that bit :P
03:44  bananasontoast: Okay, last question on jQuery UI Sortable (I think). Is there a way that I can move an element from two connected lists without having to drag? Like set up a .click() function that when fired sends a particular element from one to the other?
03:45  Psychokinesics: It doesn't make sense though.. because the if statement states if isChecked is not true then do whatever... but isChecked is true because the box is checked
03:46  Psychokinesics: As Ooter suggestion I think I'll minimise my use of plugins
03:46  Psychokinesics: just use .change once i figure out how it works
03:46 @coldhead: minimise your use of lame plugins
03:46 @coldhead: i've never heard of that one
03:46 @coldhead: and it looks maybe too "simple"
03:47  Ooter: coldhead: agreed

04:24  ailaG: hi, stupid question - what exactly does $.foo mean / do? (with any value of foo)
04:25 @paul_irish: it is a member on the jQuery object
04:25 @paul_irish: it usually doesnt mean a whole lot.
04:25 @paul_irish: $.fn.foo is a bit more interesting
04:26 @paul_irish: the jquery object ... is just a ummm. object/function/magic potion thing
04:26 @paul_irish: and you can store things on it... or jquery already has.. but it's just a place to hang a hat.
04:27  Mixmasterxp: I have something similar to an accordian. I need to fade out others when the other is faded in. Whats the best way to do this?
04:27 @paul_irish: $.fn.foo stores something on the prototype of jquery.. and that means it's accessible as a method to all your little jquery objects like this one: $('div.omg')
04:28  Mixmasterxp: set a class on them and fade out all and fade in the one with the the specific ID?
04:29  rainabba: Is there ever a reason to use $.find(selector) vs just $(selector) (the first instance I understand to search the entire document just as the second)?

04:32 @paul_irish: rainabba: the first one wont work..
04:33  Mixmasterxp: paul irish, i heard that name before
04:33  Mixmasterxp: have you made some library?
04:33  rainabba: Hey Paul. Really? Could swear it was but it looked odd so I wanted to switch to a syntax I thought more standard.

04:34  khurram: can i use json with php 4 ?
04:34  rainabba: paul_irish: Ok. Considering the shortcut for document.ready(), in that case, wouldn't that essentially be calling find against the entire document?
04:34  Mixmasterxp: I'm screen shotting this
04:34 @paul_irish: rainabba: $('#omg').find(' ...  will be faster than $('#omg ... ') but just by a tiny bit

04:36  rainabba: paul_irish: So if #omg was a div way high in the document tree and #crap was very deep, $('#omg #crap') should be slower than $('#omg').find('#crap')?
04:37 @paul_irish: well this is a bad example with IDs
04:37  rainabba: paul_irish: Not sure yet. The element I'm going for is created by asp.net so I'm not sure how consistent it's placement will be.
04:37 @paul_irish: can we use $('.omg .crap') vs $('.omg').find('.crap')   ?
04:37 @paul_irish: and if so, it's a crapshoot.
04:38 @paul_irish: rainabba: http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/ slides 21 - 33
04:38  rainabba: paul_irish: With that second example, it's more relevant because we'd be searching for potentially X number of elements through the entire document?
04:38  rainabba: ty sir

05:02  buddyq: this script works fine for all browsers except IE. Can someone tell me why this jquery stuff is not working in IE? Here is the code thats not working: https://gist.github.com/785668   on this page:    www.buddyquaid.com/dev/gsc
05:03  draginx: Your first problem is IE LOLZ
05:03  draginx: unistall windows
05:03  skiz: buddyq: what part isn't working? heh
05:03  draginx: why do people insist of using multiple var's still
05:03  skiz: I think you want getScrollWidth and getScrollHeight and such
05:03 @coldhead: $50 says there's a trailing comma
05:04  Ooter: draginx: what do you mean multiple vars - one on each line?
05:04 @coldhead: wager not legally binding
05:04  draginx: or just do $(selct)[0].scrollheight
05:04  buddyq: the overall script is not working. If you view the page in FF, you'll see it works. The task it to reposition the dropdown menu if it does not fit within the window.
05:04  draginx: Ooter: yeah
05:04  draginx: just comma seperate I believe mozilla labs prefers that even O_o
05:04  Ooter: eh, i like my stuff one line at a time too :P
05:04  draginx: u can still do one line >< i just dont need multiple vars :P
05:04  skiz: ______
05:04  draginx: skiz…not from tpbz are you?
05:04  buddyq: draginx:  thats the sumbest thing to say. I'm actually on a Mac. But we have clients...
05:05  skiz: draginx: perhaps, but I don't think so
05:06  buddyq: skiz:  so if you take a look in FF, you'll see the dropdown for marketplace fly's out from to the left instead of the right like it does on 'services'. But in IE, it's ignoring it.
05:06  draginx: buddyq: Im cleary idding around but since u didnt get it
05:06  draginx: turn off your computer
05:06  buddyq: draginx: thats fine. I don't know you and senses of humor don't come through very well in IRC
05:07  Qjimbo: Hey all
05:07  rainabba: I just feel even more in love with Chrome.
05:07  skiz: buddyq: your best bet - log, alert, or step through each of those vars
05:08  Qjimbo: Chrome is awesome
05:08  skiz: buddyq: most likely
05:08  rainabba: Realized that if you "Inspect Element", there is an "Event Listeners" list :)
05:08  Qjimbo: seriously every app should be as optimized as chrome is
05:08  skiz: buddyq: most likely the vars aren't being set correctly.  Your window width and such may be null vs using getScrollWidth and such which is Xbrowser
05:08  Qjimbo: such a refreshing change from the bloatware obsession most software publishers have these days
05:08  rainabba: No kidding
05:08 @coldhead: gross rainabba
05:08 +Mixmasterxp: he left :(
05:09  rainabba: coldhead: ?
05:09  buddyq: skiz: so ... $(window).width() is not xbrowser?
05:09 @coldhead: you are in love with a browser :)
05:09  Qjimbo: haha
05:09  skiz: I had a pita today with IE regarding doing a jQuery('#foo').width(x)  doesn't work in IE..  I had to jQuery('#foo').css('width', X)
05:09  rainabba: coldhead: Wouldn't be the first techo-crush I've had.
05:09  Qjimbo: I didn't know that there was an event listeners list either thats pretty neat
05:10  rainabba: I've been looking for an easy way to confirm my .bind() calls worked correctly.
05:10  Qjimbo: neat, whereabouts is it? I can see Event Listener breakpoints in the scripts tab
05:10  Qjimbo: but that seems like something else
05:11  skiz: too bad there isn't an event for events being triggered
05:11  skiz: or is there? (ponders...)
05:12  Qjimbo: anyway guess I should ask my lovely noobish question: What are some good simple methods for ajax file uploading in jquery? I want to upload a file then refresh the div content with stuff generated from a script that has processed the uploaded file
05:12 +Mixmasterxp: Qjimbo: I dont think you can upload files with pure ajax
05:12  skiz: Qjimbo: flash upload, or iframe upload  basically
05:13  skiz: you can upload to a hidden iframe and capture/trigger events pretty easily
05:13 +Mixmasterxp: There is a small flash that you can hook jquery into
05:13  Qjimbo: oh thats pretty cool
05:13  Qjimbo: I like the sound of the iframe method
05:14  Qjimbo: I always try to avoid flash like the plague
05:14  skiz: Qjimbo: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/iframe-post-form
05:14  skiz: theres the guts, what you do with it is up to you
05:15 +Mixmasterxp: I dont get how that works, the description on the site is vague
05:16 +Mixmasterxp: they're using an iframe to mimic a whole page upload?
05:18  RTPMatt: Mixmasterxp: Im a little late here, but, bascially if you se the target on your form to an ifram that is hidden on the page, you can "fake" and ajax upload
05:18  Qjimbo: thats kinda cool
05:18  Qjimbo: so it posts it to the iframe then grabs the iframe content
05:18  RTPMatt: yes
05:19  skiz: Mixmasterxp: basically, you create a hidden iframe on your page and set the target of the upload to the iframe, on completion, it passes the result back to your main document.
05:19  skiz: heh
05:40  draginx: Any idea why &raquo; will not work in .append() ?
05:41  draginx: &nbsp; does -_-
05:41 @coldhead: &raquo; isn't a real thing?
05:41 @coldhead: oh it is
05:41 @coldhead: so sorry
05:42  draginx: i tried the html # too
05:42  draginx: 187;
05:42 @coldhead: jsfiddle?
05:43  buddyq: so it looks like my problem is the script is failing with IE in getting the offset.
05:43  buddyq: subLeft = Math.round(subMenu.offset().left);   does not work in IE
05:43  buddyq: what do I do?
05:45 @coldhead: which part of that expression is not working?
05:45 @coldhead: is it undefied or NaN or '27px' or what
05:46  buddyq: says its 0

08:05  jones_: I have something like this:
08:05 @coldhead: hello.
08:05  jones_: $('selector').bind('mouseover', my_func);
08:05  jones_: I now realize that I would like to pass an argument to my_func.
08:06  jones_: How can I change the line above?
08:06  jones_: I have tried my_func(my_arg) and function() {my_func(my_arg);} but no  luck.

08:08  jones_: Why do I need it?
08:08  unfo-: it's not required
08:09  unfo-: your  function() {my_func(my_arg);}  should work a-ok
08:09  unfo-: if it's not, then jsfiddle
08:09  jones_: ok jsfiddle then :)
08:09  unfo-: you did read http://api.jquery.com/bind/ and looked at the examples?
08:10  jones_: Yeah.
08:10  unfo-: kk
08:10  jones_: Indeed I thought that function(){my_func(my_arg);} should've worked.
08:10  unfo-: i am guessing, before you paste, that this is a scope / 'this' issue :)

08:16  jones_: as*
08:16  jones_: And all it does is change a css property.
08:17  jones_: unfo-: what were you saying about $this?
08:17  jones_: I think that $this is different, between the two cases.
08:17  unfo-: jones_, that this is not what you think it is :)
08:17  unfo-: lemme hook you up with a good slideshow
08:17  unfo-: sec
08:18  unfo-: jones_, http://fixingthesejquery.com/ good read
08:18  jones_: ok thanks
08:18  jones_: anyway, fyi, in one case, $(this) is the HTMLElement I mean it to be. In the second page it's the whole DOM :)

09:21 @coldhead: beevi7: you don't have to do it that way
09:21 @coldhead: that way is simply more beautiful in the opinion of the author
09:22 @coldhead: i like it because you can set up an object with the properties you're using and reuse it as needed, instead of having to mess around with strings and 'qu"o"tes'

09:33  paul_irish: i dont understand the context...e xample?
09:33  alcuadrado: oh, the selector was '[title="asd"]'
09:33 @coldhead: is [title="whater"] slower than img[title="whater"]
09:33  paul_irish: yes. big perf difference
09:33  ace_me: coldhead and inside each how to refer to the current element ? with this.id ?
09:33 @coldhead: ace_me: $(this)
09:33  paul_irish: you have an implied * (universal) selector without 'img'
09:34  paul_irish: which is really slow
09:34 @coldhead: or you can do function (elem) which makes it available as elem in the fn
09:34  paul_irish: this is covered in the slides.

09:59  Deele: danheberden: if that is possible to control parent items from child items? like... I have a jquery script, inside iframe. It makes slideDown()/hide() for collapsable content inside iframe html. I need to make iframe dynamically change height depending on html. I just wanted to know, if that code is inside iframe, if it can control it and other higher parent items?
09:59  jee: thanks, I will have a look at the link you sent

10:03  hux: :-/
10:04  Zxurian: well either way
10:04  Zxurian: "something" is causing it to change, i just want to try and find out what it is
10:04  hux: firebug/chrome would let you see the class where the css is being applied from... but right now I see what you mean..
10:04  Zxurian: where in Firebug would I setup such a catch

10:24  Zxurian: okay, so I tried the watcher.jquery, but it's not firing
10:24  hux: Zxurian: Does your firebug console say anything?
10:24  Zxurian: nope
10:25  Zxurian: according to the documentation on the original stackoverflow link
10:25  Zxurian: which I replicated, it should be throwing up an alert when the height changes, but it doesn't
10:25  Zxurian: but reading through the plugin, it doesn't look like it does what I awnt it to do
10:25  Zxurian: that plugin is meant to fire a function when <something> changes on an element
10:26  Zxurian: I'm looking for something that will tell me "what" changed <something>
10:30  hux: Zxurian: you could just modify that script to do what you want - I just meant it to be a starting point per-sey
10:32  hux: Zxurian: however, you could most-likely just 'grep' your codebase to figure out where the locations are that are interacting with whatever it is that is being changed
10:32  hux: and if you needed to stop it, just change the class name or id or something of that nature?
10:33  hux: or maybe I am still not quite grasping your situation

11:01  ocf_: Kasreyn - the last time I used theme switcher, that was like that for me too
11:02  ocf_: kephu, I'm not guru wizard like some of these guys, so my process would be to console.log the shit outta the code & see what comes up
11:02  Kasreyn: ocf_: no big deal just wondering why..

11:28  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:28  ruby_on_tails: never worked on json
11:28  Ar-ras: request is sent, but answer is emty, as seen on firebug
11:28  blackspotwiggins: success callback gets passed parsed json, not xhr
11:28  Ar-ras: blackspotwiggins ?
11:28  blackspotwiggins: if the answer is empty you should send something from the server :)
11:29  nlogax: needsomehelp: but not, say, prototype.js or something else?
11:29  Ar-ras: http://teamgesundheit.develweb.de/json.php?_a=search
11:29  Ar-ras: there is a response :O
11:29  blackspotwiggins: use /json.php

11:30  Ar-ras: request
11:30  Ar-ras: sry forgot to mention

11:37  fre: hi
11:38  fre: i have a question: if i do something like this: var anchors = $(this).find('a'); then something like this alert(anchors[0].text()); should be possible, right?
11:39  blackspotwiggins: Ar-ras, you are not using json
11:39  blackspotwiggins: so the response is empty
11:39  fre: firebug gives me an error that anchors[0].text() is not a function
11:39  Ar-ras: gut i use
11:39  Ar-ras: blackspotwiggins $.getJSON('http://teamgesundheit.develweb.de/json.php?_a=search ', function(res) {alert(res.responseText);});
11:39  Ar-ras: or what is the mistake?
11:39  blackspotwiggins: fre, if you do anchors[0] you get plain dom object
11:39  blackspotwiggins: you cant use .text() on that
11:39  blackspotwiggins: try .eq(0)
11:40  fre: so i got to turn it into jquery again?
11:41  Ar-ras: blackspotwiggins :O?
11:41  fre: blackspotwiggins: thank you a lot! i was getting nuts about this as in the documentation it says you can access jQuery objects created by find() like an array
11:41  blackspotwiggins: fre you can
11:42  blackspotwiggins: but the result would not be a jquery object
11:42  fre: or with .get(0)
11:42  blackspotwiggins: if you debugged it in firebug you would have seen it
11:42  fre: didn't say that anywhere
11:42  fre: but thanks
11:42  blackspotwiggins: Ar-ras, you must use $.ajax and specify type as jsonp
11:42  needsomehelp: nlogax: any idea why "$.ajax is not a function" ?

12:48  Yoric: hi
12:48  peepoofoobar: could you please help me in that
12:48  Yoric: I have created a dom element with my usual dom manipulation functions (document.createElement, etc.)
12:49  Yoric: Now, $(foo) doesn't seem to do anything on that element, i.e. it returns the element, not a jQuery.
12:49  Ar-ras: Yoric sample code?

12:50  Psychokinesics: 2 of my columns in a table are for checkboxes. 1 for selected all, read, unread, replied, none messages and the other is for selecting what messages a user wants to make favourite. I notice when I click the select "all" link that ALL of my checkboxes are selected. I don't want the favourites checkbox column checkboxes to be selected. How would I achieve this?
12:51  Ar-ras: Psychokinesics do the columns have class attribute?
12:52  Psychokinesics: Yea
12:52  peepoofoobar: is nlogax / seutje here?
12:52  Ar-ras: $("td.col1>input").
12:54  g0bl1n: in a table TR, I have a SELECT in a cell and a A (link) in another. If the SELECT changes, I want to change the css attributes for that link, 2 cells ahead in the same row. The change() event is working fine, but I need to find the A link. I have $(".ordertype").find(".actionlink").css('color', 'blue');
12:55  g0bl1n: find() doesn't work here, right ?
12:55  Ar-ras: g0bl1n use parent() to get one step higher in the dom tree
12:55  g0bl1n: Ar-ras, and then find ? ok
12:55  Ar-ras: find or children
12:56  Ar-ras: yes find
12:57  g0bl1n: but being in the SELECT, I need to go up 2 levels to get to the row, right ?
12:57 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
12:57  g0bl1n: parent().parent() is ugly. How can jump 2 steps ?
12:57  Ar-ras: use parent().parent() even it is ugly
12:57  Psychokinesics: but in the first columns class I am echoing some php and in the second column the class has "favourite" @ Ar-ras
12:58  Ar-ras: Psychokinesics look for function not() or the selector :not
13:00  g0bl1n: Ar-ras, instead I've done a closest('.row_class').find(...) and it worked. What is more safer/performant ? closest() or parent().parent().parent() ?
13:00  peepoofoobar: argghhh never mind I found the solution. The bastardly ajaxupload plugin is the rogue.
13:03  Ar-ras: g0bl1n I dont know. if you change alot the structure closest is better, but parent should be faster i think

13:18  Psychokinesics: thanks
13:21  russinkungen: g0bl1n: a little late perhaps but you can use .parents(selector) aswell. dunno if there's any performance-difference between that and closest. probably is.
13:24  nlogax: yes, closest should stop when it finds a match, parents will march on

13:43  unfo-: taking
13:44  russinkungen: g0bl1n: hmm tried something out: as nlogax mentioned, it will continue searching parents in the dom. if you have twelve steps in the hiearchy and want to find .parent().parent(), then .parent().parent() is actually faster.
13:45  russinkungen: as in http://jsfiddle.net/dbengtsson/8Leek/4/
13:46  g0bl1n: russinkungen, so parents() goes all the way up ? ok

16:01  slonik: fRAiLtY-, check this http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/methods/uploadifysettings/
16:02  teddy_: probably not the forum for this question, but I'm not sure where else to ask it. How would I go about if I want to extract information from a google map that I've created and create links for each markers on the map which then interacts with the map (toogles the markers information). I haven't been able to find anything for this. I don't want to create the damn map, that's already done for me. I just want to interact with it.
16:02  Aamir: Altreus: c is also not the first level of div.foo
16:02  slonik: fRAiLtY-, scrptData, exactly
16:03  fRAiLtY-: Ah, do I set scriptData to 'always' ?
16:03  slonik: no no
16:03  Psychokinesics: Hi was wondering if anyone could help me with this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4736338/selecting-all-inbox-messages-user-has-checked-using-javascript-jquery
16:04  Aamir: teddy_:  find the class used by google in there markers and interact with those from outside?
16:04  tsyrak: hmmm.....
16:04  tsyrak: just spent two hours working with a menu system
16:04  slonik: fRAiLtY-, at form submit/button click event you do $('#updfy').uploadifySettings('scriptData', 'some=additional&data=here');
16:04  tsyrak: to find out that .click stops working with it
16:05  Aamir: Altreus: your example is really strange. c is inside 4 - you want it but you dont want a or b
16:05  Altreus: Aamir: Sure it is. Its parent is div.bar
16:05  Altreus: div 3 has foo, so a and b should not be picked up. 4 has bar, so c should
16:06  slonik: fRAiLtY-, and this will be sent as HTTP request (GET or POST)
16:06  slonik: fRAiLtY-, so you can pass some additional data to your script
16:06  Aamir: Altreus:  is there any other wrapper around those divs?
16:07  Aamir: you can use something like   parentDiv > div.foo
16:07  Aamir: it will select the direct childs
16:07  Altreus: But c is not a direct child
16:07  Altreus: :)
16:08  Altreus: I think it boils down to: all [selector] that do not have a parent of [selector]
16:08  Blinny: I'm experiencing extreme slowness with IE7 and IE8 using jquery-ui's sortable interaction. I have an example page up at http://www.peopleplaces.org/dave/our_example.html  -- Firefox & Chrome complete in .7 seconds, IE will take 20 seconds to complete and display the onLoad alert. If I remove sortable from my jquery custom download, things speed up but of course no functionality.
16:08  Altreus: s/parent/ancestor/
16:09  m0dmd: hey everyone.
16:09  Blinny: I'd rather not split the page on jsfiddle.. things are ordered just so to avoid interaction problems with another library (milonic dhtml menu)
16:09  m0dmd: any idea on how to customize my theme for two plugins on the same page.
16:10  m0dmd: I'm trying to customize each with the id of the container
16:10  Alkaaran: thanks guys about .each & return false; works well
16:10  Vaerros: m0dmd, you mean different themes for different parts of the page?
16:10  m0dmd: Yea
16:10  Alkaaran: Altreus++
16:11  m0dmd: was just running many tests with #my-id .ui-autocomplete {} no luck
16:11  m0dmd: even tried #my-id ul {} no luck
16:11  Altreus: :)
16:11  Vaerros: m0dmd, themeroller lets you specify a 'css scope'
16:11  m0dmd: ahhhh alright going to take a look.
16:11  Vaerros: on the download page, udner 'Advanced Theme Settings'
16:12  m0dmd: thank you, i thought i'd be able to accomplish this via direct css manipulation
16:13  Aamir: Altreus:  here we go
16:13  Aamir: jQuery('#parent').find('div.foo').not('div.foo > div.foo')
16:13  Aamir: Altreus: http://gyazo.com/3eab08bd29c8ed81f5ba1d2c1eb09c75.png
16:13  fRAiLtY-: slonik: I understand, but how would I integrate that with my current submit button which has a different call, like this: onclick="$('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()"
16:13  Altreus: Aamir: good find :)
16:14  Altreus: I mean
16:14  Altreus: clearly you made it
16:14  Altreus: Aamir: Good er ... logic!
16:14  Altreus: Aamir++
16:14  m0dmd: Vaerros thank you
16:14  Aamir: .not is the magic
16:14  teddy_: Aamir: Hmmm, I'll take a look at that. Thanks.
16:14  Vaerros: np
16:15  slonik: fRAiLtY-, onclick="$('#file_upload').uploadifySettings(...); $('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()" - but better to separate javascript into .js file and use .click() handler for example IMO
16:16  slonik: and do not use inline scripting
16:17  fRAiLtY-: Ah I see, and in scriptData do I do this then to get the folder name? scriptData = 'folder=files/<?_POST['orderId'];?>' from the name of the text input orderId
16:18  davemo: Psychokinesics: answered your q on stack overflow
16:18  davemo: I hope I was clear enough
16:20  slonik: fRAiLtY-, yes, but only if you'll pas it manually using uploadifySettings() I might be wrong and the data has to be in JSON format - check it
16:20  tsyrak: i am using a plugin that has the unwanted effect of prevent click events from spreading the way i want them too
16:20  tsyrak: once inside a .click() function (inside the plugin) how can i pass the event normally?
16:20  tsyrak: so that it keeps spreading
16:21  slonik: fRAiLtY-, check the example on the page I gave you and you can google some more, specifically scriptData
16:21  vbabiy: How can I append a list of elements to another element
16:22  Psychokinesics: Thanks @ davemo
16:22  Michael: Finding issues in phpStorm that are really bad.
16:22  Psychokinesics: I'll take a look now
16:24 --- Cain` is now known as Cain
16:25  slonik: fRAiLtY-, you can do that as well by doing $('#your_uploadify').uploadifySettings('scriptData', '&amp;' + $('#your_form_id').serialize()); and you'll pass all the form's values
16:25  Altreus: This is weird. You'd think that removing the > from Aamir's solution would cause it to work at any depth and not just based on immediate parentage but it seems to filter everything but the first. :s
16:25  Altreus: http://jsfiddle.net/prPTS/1/
16:25  slonik: gotta go, l8r
16:25  tsyrak: how do i send an event to an item?
16:25  Altreus: oh ...
16:25  Altreus: My filter doesn't work either
16:25  m0dmd: interesting, including this custom .js by themeroller and it's telling me autocomplete is not a function ....
16:26  m0dmd: wish i could disable the theme control and design the output myself.
16:26  Vaerros: m0dmd, was widgets->autocomplete checked when you downloaded?
16:26  m0dmd: yea
16:26  m0dmd: rofl
16:26  m0dmd: and it's in the .js file as well/
16:27  etcetera: how do I get the fieldcontain div to take up like 90% of the width of the document?
16:27  m0dmd: i just put the file where my autocomplete.js file is and i know the paths are fine.
16:27  fRAiLtY-: slonik: This makes the script not fire at all :( - <input onclick="$('#file_upload').uploadifySettings('scriptData', '&amp;' + $('#artworkForm').serialize()); $('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()" type="button" value="Submit" />
16:27  m0dmd: ahhh
16:27  m0dmd: Vaerros found my problem :)
16:27  m0dmd: thanx to you!
16:28  hazamonzo_: Hi folks. How do i replace the text in multiple divs (names the div ids the same thing but only one div is changed)
16:28  hazamonzo_: Just give me something to google :)
16:29  Brodingo: so i want to change the title and make the fieldset not collapsible for Url Settings when editing a node. do i just put the whole path_form_alter function in template.php and change what i want?
16:29  Vanesco: Hey, This is an annoying question but how do i iterate though this simple Json result using jquery? http://pastebin.com/0ituQXk3
16:32  tsyrak: Vanesco: 				$.each( data.responseData.results, function ( i, item ) { dostuff; }      ?
16:32  Blinny: I believe I've found a bug in jquery-ui's sortable interaction.

If I remove sortable from my jquery custom download, things speed up but of course no functionality. I'd love to hear that I've just done something stupid though..
16:33  Brodingo: oops wrong chan :3
16:33  Blinny: (And whomever just tried to grab the page, apologies - .htaccess removed)
16:33  MrJones: hi
16:33  fRAiLtY-: slonik: This makes the script not fire at all :( - <input onclick="$('#file_upload').uploadifySettings('scriptData', '&amp;' + $('#artworkForm').serialize()); $('#file_upload').uploadifyUpload()" type="button" value="Submit" /> what have I done wrong?
16:34  MrJones: when having <div someprop="la"><textarea></textarea></div>, shouldn't $('div[someprop="la"] > textarea'); give me that textarea?
16:34  MrJones: $('div[someprop="la"]') works, but I seem to be unable to reach the child with $('div[someprop="la"] > textarea'); or $('div[someprop="la"] > :input');
16:35  timmywil: MrJones: yes that should work, what browser?
16:36  MrJones: timmywil: firefox 3.6.13 on mac os x 10.6.6
16:36  MrJones: (intel)
16:36  timmywil: k, that kills that theory
16:36  uris: hi guys, im a jquery newbie. I am trying to serialize a form without knowing its name, is that possisble? e.g. $(this).serialize()

16:42  timmywil: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/XkxsZ/2/
16:42  MrJones: timmywil: how can I safely check whether I actually got a result? :x and not just something 'empty'
16:43  MrJones: I already wondered that for a longer time and used to use .html() which doesn't really make sense in this case :D (empty string)
16:44  timmywil: MrJones: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/XkxsZ/3/
16:44  MrJones: ah nice
16:44  MrJones: thanks :)
16:44  timmywil: np =)
16:44  m0dmd: Vaerros can you give me an example of custom-scope
16:45  m0dmd: if i give the css-scope the id of a container, then it should use the styling, right?
16:45  timmywil: uris: yes, just need to be in the right context
16:45  timmywil: where are you trying to serialize?
16:45  m0dmd: css-scope: my-id , #my-id .ui-autocomplete?
16:46  m0dmd: "Write completely custom CSS" is proving completely untrue for me.
16:47  Patabugen: Is this a bad place to ask for help with the Validate plugin? The docs are offline so I've had to stop re-reading them. I find when I use _any_ validator or a single field, all fields always say they are invalid if any numeric fields are used.
16:47  Patabugen: It sounds like a really bad bug, but it's more likely me mis-using something
16:48  Vanesco: tsyrak: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/323309/ i can only get all of the results at once, data.responseData.results doesn't exist
16:48  Patabugen: It happens whether I use a custom function or a default one

16:49 --- rchern-afk is now known as rchern
16:51  Patabugen: ahh, it does have something to do with my custom validators
16:51  Altreus: Here's a question. Why does this output '3 1' ?  http://jsfiddle.net/prPTS/2/
16:51  Altreus: It's clear that the div with ID 3 has no parents at all besides the body and html tags
16:51  Altreus: let alone one with class foo
16:53  Altreus: Further testing tells me that - as I suspected - 1 is being reported as a parent of 3
16:53 --- halcyon1234real is now known as halcyon1234

16:54  xotix: hi
16:55  markj: probably doesnt like your invalid id's much either
16:55  xotix: i'm making a xml validator. quite simple. so i have a textarea, and a error like, error on line 3. so now i want to have numbered lines in that text area and/or highlight the 3. line. how can i manipulate a textarea content like that?
17:01  fRAiLtY-: Can anyone help me with this? I'm trying to get this script to set the 'folder' variable to whatever the user inputs in the text input called "orderId", see here: http://codepad.org/lkEMUvZ2
17:08  Blinny: ﻿ I believe I've found a bug in jquery-ui's sortable interaction that causes extreme slowness in IE 7 & 8.

Should I file a bug or am I doing something incorrectly?
17:12  Michael: Anyone else having issues with the latest beta of phpstorm?
17:12  Michael: It's always indexing which renders a lot of actions useless and it seems to be leaking memory.
17:13  SugaSlide: yeah
17:13  Michael: hmm
17:13  SugaSlide: i get it from time to time
17:13  SugaSlide: and it just hangs for a min or 2
17:13  Michael: yeah
17:13  Michael: not just me then
17:13  Patabugen: Aarrgghh! In case it ever saves anyone a whole bunch of time, you cannot make a custom validator called "name" with this plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
17:15  Michael: gotta love that
17:15  Michael: Just like you can't call an ExternalInterface method in AS3 "play" because that conflicts with ActiveX's JS injection into flash
17:16  Vanesco: Hey, This is an annoying question but how do i iterate though this simple Json result using jquery? http://pastebin.com/0ituQXk3
17:16  SugaSlide: $.each(jsonthingy,function(i,v){
17:16  Vanesco: My code by the way http://paste.pocoo.org/show/323309/ i can only get all of the results at once. ( i know i'm alert'ing data)
17:16  markj: name is a keyword so you shouldn't use it anyway
17:17  SugaSlide: i = index.. v = value
17:17  Vanesco: SugaSlide: i'm doing that, but i get all of them :(
17:17  Vanesco: ie. item = everything
17:17  Vanesco: * v = everything, to use your code
17:17  glen1: is there a way to detect if something is in the viewport
17:18  SugaSlide: Vanesco you want to manualy advance to the next 1?
17:18  Patabugen: markj: It shouldn't cause problems like that in a string
17:18  SugaSlide: data[0].test
17:18  SugaSlide: type thing?
17:20  Vanesco: SugaSlide: data[0] is undefined
17:20  Patabugen: .... how do I create an account on jQuery.com? If I click on Login/Create Account it gives me a login box but never an option to create an account..
17:21  SugaSlide: Vanesco you sure the returned data is valid etc?
17:22  oodavid: Is it possible to extend the AJAX object to use PUT and DELETE too?
17:22  Vanesco: SugaSlide: according to http://jsonlint.com/ it's valid JSON
17:22  SugaSlide: hmm
17:22  Michael: oodavid, http://becoming.smart.joyent.com/day_two.html
17:22  Michael: You can use type: 'delete' in $.ajax
17:23  oodavid: Michael - aha! Cheers!

17:36  adatta02: soee, yah use visibility=hidden to do that
17:36  soee: i just need to animate this somehow :/
17:36  soee: can i use fadeIn wirh visibility ?
17:36  adatta02: you could us opacity
17:37  adatta02: not 100% sure - I think fadeIn toggles display first
