09:54  blackspotwiggins: windows is bestest webserver!
09:54  mekwall: sean`: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/D7mgg/
09:54  mekwall: hey blackspotwiggins !
09:54  blackspotwiggins: oh wait, no it isnt :P
09:54  mekwall: did you get my message yesterday?
09:54  blackspotwiggins: hey mekwall
09:54  blackspotwiggins: yea
09:54  mekwall: was that what you had problems doing?
09:54  blackspotwiggins: no
09:54  mekwall: :/
09:55  mekwall: so what was your dilemma? i've never really had any trouble with timezones
09:55  doonie: mekwall somewhat buggy now when moving mouse
09:55  mekwall: local time is detected, chosen time is known and server time is known
09:55  doonie: I click, move mouse a px it dissapears
09:55 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 90 seconds
09:55  mekwall: doonie: yeah I noticed that... no idea why
09:55  doonie: heh
09:55  mekwall: I changed the events
09:55  blackspotwiggins: the situation i described, it actually reflects the same time, yes?
09:55  mekwall: mouseenter and mouseleaves
09:56  mekwall: instead of mouseover and mouseout
09:56  blackspotwiggins: now if you wanted to store a new value on the server
09:56  blackspotwiggins: you would have to use new Date() to get it, correct?
09:56  blackspotwiggins: for current timestamp
09:56  mekwall: ok
09:56  blackspotwiggins: now, you need to send that to server in one format(ISO), display to user in another(custom) in his timezone
09:57  vpv4oo: is hasId() realizable?
09:57  blackspotwiggins: so if your pc is at -5 and user timezone is +10
09:57  blackspotwiggins: to show that current timestamp, you have to shift it 15 hours
09:58  mekwall: yeah?
09:58  blackspotwiggins: and because it is shown to an input field which also stores information, it has to be reverse parsed to normalized time also..
09:58  blackspotwiggins: that caused some issues
09:58  blackspotwiggins: when you do manual shifting you cant use getUTCMinutes anymore ;)
09:58  mekwall: I can't see how, but but :D
09:58  blackspotwiggins: to get the REAL date
09:58  mekwall: you get timezone offset
09:59  blackspotwiggins: which is ALWAYS the offset of pc
09:59  mekwall: yes
09:59  mekwall: but we know the users timezone don't we?
09:59  blackspotwiggins: when it is actually +10, not -5
09:59  mekwall: as long as we have all the variables, there shouldn't be any trouble calculating
09:59  blackspotwiggins: ofc, when its done correctly :P
10:00  mekwall: so, what you are saying is... you didn't? :D
10:00  blackspotwiggins: at first, no
10:00  blackspotwiggins: didnt see all the problems beforehand
10:00  jomofcw: Hello =)
10:00  mekwall: haha, then I get it :P
10:00  mekwall: hey jomo
10:00  mekwall: now help me debug the damn click event
10:00  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/D7mgg/
10:01  blackspotwiggins: still the same issue as yesterday?
10:02  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: what issue was that? :D
10:03  blackspotwiggins: form submit at button click
10:03  blackspotwiggins: this seems to be fixed now
10:04  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: yes, that is fixed
10:04  vpv4oo: how do i get $(this).id and use it?
10:04  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: I am now trying to get the click event for document to behave correctly
10:04  blackspotwiggins: vpv4oo, this.id
10:04  vpv4oo: oh.
10:05  vpv4oo: thanks :)
10:05  vpv4oo: what is returned if there is no id set?

10:21  solars: how do you toggle visibility of an element? (not display:none as with .hide/.show/.toggle but visibility:hidden)
10:22  jomofcw: solars i thinks there isn't core method to do that
10:22  jomofcw: but yopu could sue the :visibility selector
10:22  jomofcw: :visible
10:23  doonie: there iz, sean` show em
10:23  jomofcw: ?:visible @ solars
10:23  bot-t: solars, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/

10:23  Ozzapoo_: Thanks!
10:24  sean`: solars, you'll have to do it yourself

10:24  solars: thank you
10:24  jomofcw: that's what I said :'(
10:25  jomofcw: There's no toggle visibility :D You've to do it on your own ^^
10:25  solars: I mean, not get it but set it
10:25  jomofcw: using :visible and css()

10:30  sean`: fun fact: if you put your headphones plug into a usb port, your pc will crash
10:32  jomofcw: solars it should
10:32  solars: weird
10:32  jomofcw: just not sure about using a "-" in the ID

10:42  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, sean` : I think I solved it! http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/D7mgg/

10:43  jomofcw: or kinda
10:44  jomofcw: So my fault in some case :)
10:44  jomofcw: :visible doesn't work anymore as I expect.
10:45  jomofcw: but, solars, in main case, you've better to use display instead of visibility
10:45  solars: oh
10:45  solars: yeah
10:45  solars: problem was just that I wanted it to not dissapear and free space
10:45  solars: but I'm okay with this plugin
10:45  solars: jomofcw, thanks for your help anyway :)

10:48  jomofcw: and it confirm

10:58  blackspotwiggins: if you have id="" you already fail
10:58  Xtracted: Its not my code, I am working on a widget that creates empty ids to all list objects
10:59  abracsi: do you mean the first element that has a child, and has an id
10:59  triptec: hey, I'd like to have 2 columns, one with categoies and one with topics, both should be sortable but I'd also like to be able to drop topics on the categories
11:00  triptec: anyone who know of a plugin
11:00  Xtracted: I mean the first parent in the tree list that has an id that isnt ''

11:06  Khaan: hi everybody - thanks in advance - i'm trying to make this function work but the onFinish is not triggered: http://pastebin.com/dMq2gJsB -> thus said, might it be a dom error, is this function written correctly?
11:06  jomofcw: or something like that
11:06  Xtracted: hmm
11:06  Xtracted: yeah
11:06  Xtracted: seems like I am forced to do an each
11:06  jomofcw: but the real prob is that your widget put empty ID
11:06  jomofcw: that's a really weird thing
11:07  Xtracted: yeah, I know....
11:07  triptec: Xtracted: yeah but, when I drop a topic on a category I don't want it in the column, I just want a ajax call to give the topic that category
11:07  Xtracted: Not much I can do about that
11:07  Xtracted: triptec: You can make a function that triggers when you drop an element into a droppable
11:08  Xtracted: triptec: But the UI drag/drop/sort is pretty primitive and needs a lot of special hacks if you want to do anything more advanced with it
11:08  triptec: Xtracted: oh, ok
11:08  mongag: How to check if element exists ?
11:09  Xtracted: triptec: but its doable, just read up on the documentation of droppables, draggables and sortables

11:41  SugaSlide: i actualy told you wahat to do for starters res_ras_ajaxy... once you done with that.. i would help you with the .animate part that makes the block move
11:42  san: thanks Man
11:42  SugaSlide: 1st step make the css.. 2nd step get the ajax page into the dom.. 3rd step make the block move into view
11:42  JKarsrud: san: this one is a bit old, but works: http://www.learningjquery.com/
11:43  doonie: 4th step, get a tv
11:43  SugaSlide: na

11:43  doonie: 5th. get a gf ;p
11:43  SugaSlide: your moms taking a break for a bit
11:43  SugaSlide: once shes "fixed" step 5 taken care of
11:44  phrearch: suppose foo.bar = function{} , is there a way to call foo.bar from a string then?
11:44  SugaSlide: :P
11:44  SugaSlide: foo.bar()
11:45  res_ras_ajaxy: SugaSlide: just fixed it myself.. I read two effects, fade in and slide in with .animate(). I set a delay() when the content is loaded between the two effects so that the users see's the fade in first before slide down
11:45  triptec: what's the quickest way to implement a search function, only show objects that match a input sring or something?
11:45  kolor: phrearch: eval(stringvar+'()')

11:49  Shaun_: Hey guys, When the .load function is used to refresh a div, the delete button links no longer work, http://www.webdesignerforum.co.uk/topic/44034-jquery-dymanic-links-not-working-with-load-unless-page-has-been-refreshed-fully/ full topic here.
11:49  blackspotwiggins: let me guess, you use bind?
11:50  blackspotwiggins: "expert web guru" :D
11:50  Shaun_: No :)
11:50  blackspotwiggins: well, live/delegate should stay working
11:50  blackspotwiggins: otherwise you have to rebind
11:50  Shaun_: I tried live?
11:51  Shaun_: Im realy struggling here..
11:52  JKarsrud: rebind in the success callback and see if that works?
11:53  Shaun_: How do i rebind?

11:58  Shaun_: Ok, I carnt see how changing from ID to classes will solve the problem?
11:58  blackspotwiggins: Shaun_, if you put rel="delete" or class="delete" on all the links that actually delete
11:58  blackspotwiggins: then bind .live to that
11:59  blackspotwiggins: it would work
11:59  Shaun_: Ok
11:59  Shaun_: Will give it a shot now :)
11:59  blackspotwiggins: and you wouldnt need to bind to exact ids
11:59 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 91 seconds
11:59  Shaun_: So, how would it know which peice of data to delete then?
12:00  blackspotwiggins: you can still have the id
12:00  blackspotwiggins: but not bind to it
12:00  blackspotwiggins: when the click is triggered, you can find out which element it is triggered on
12:00  blackspotwiggins: and get the id from that
12:01  Shaun_: I see what your saying, Ok let me try it.
12:03  Shaun_: $(".delete-status").live('click', function() {
12:03  Shaun_: <a class="delete-status" id="<?php echo $row['id']; ?>" href="#">Delete</a>
12:03  Shaun_: The click function is not even doing anything now..
12:03  blackspotwiggins: id has to have something more than just a number
12:04  Shaun_: Ok
12:04  blackspotwiggins: well console.log the id, it should do that at least
12:04  blackspotwiggins: try row-<%= id %> or similar
12:05  Shaun_: No that doesnt solve it, Im going to open up a new html page and do some playing around.
12:05  Shaun_: or should i say php page
12:07 --- soniq is now known as hrwath
12:10  Shaun_: Can $(document).ready(function() {}); be used multiple times on a page.
12:10  blackspotwiggins: yeah
12:10  Shaun_: Ahh cool, thanks
12:11  blackspotwiggins: i suggest you put that code in something that is loaded only once
12:11  blackspotwiggins: otherwise you get multiple event handlers running
12:16  Shaun_: True, but for testing this will do.
12:17  Shaun_: Ok, So, How should i collect the id attr value from a link?
12:17  blackspotwiggins: this.id ?
12:17  seutje: I usually use something like $('.foo').not('.foo-processed').addClass('.foo-processed').doShit();
12:18  Shaun_: this.id? Im not the best guy with jquery to be onist, Im still on a learning curve.
12:18  seutje: granted, it's a perf hit, but it keeps things a bit sane when ajaxies are flying left and right
12:18  seutje: this.id isn't even jQueries :)
12:18  blackspotwiggins: Shaun_, in the event handler, this refers to the element
12:18  Shaun_: Ahh, Like a class $this->
12:18  blackspotwiggins: err
12:18  blackspotwiggins: no
12:19  Shaun_: Refers to itself?
12:19  blackspotwiggins: try not to think php in js world
12:19  blackspotwiggins: this refers to context the function is run
12:19  Shaun_: Ok :)
12:20  Shaun_: $('.delete-link').live('click', function() { 			$.ajax({ 				url: "delete.php", 				type: "post", 				data:  				}); 		});
12:20  Shaun_: data:
12:20  seutje: "it's just javascript"™
12:20  Shaun_: Whats the full code to collect the id of a link in a class.
12:20  blackspotwiggins: this.id
12:21  Shaun_: "seutje" text/jascript? some browsers do not like javascript
12:21  blackspotwiggins: but that will give you "row-2" or similar
12:21  Shaun_: just "javascript"
12:21  Shaun_: Ok :)
12:21  blackspotwiggins: so do something like this.id.split("-")[1]
12:21  seutje: whaaa?
12:21  Shaun_: dm :) and ok
12:21  blackspotwiggins: Shaun_, yeah some browsers - like netscape 2.0 ?
12:21  seutje: forreal
12:22  Shaun_: Not sure, but the last time i was here some guy said not to use just "javascript"
12:22  Shaun_: use text/javascript
12:22  seutje: pretty much all browsers assume any <script> is javascript, unless stated otherwise

12:28  triptec: ?

12:29  Shaun_: doesnt seem to be working.

13:20  abracsi: heh ok,
13:20  SugaSlide: if it works...
13:20  SugaSlide: use it
13:20  SugaSlide: but i somehow doubt it will
13:20  x3rames: but i'd be pretty annoying, I guess
13:21  SugaSlide: ye
13:21  abracsi: annoying?
13:21  x3rames: as in "not very usable"
13:21  abracsi: two tier display system? two clicks to access your data?
13:22  abracsi: catagory, subcatagory
13:22  x3rames: I thought of something like that, when you said accordion: http://www.p51labs.com/accordion/
13:22  abracsi: was also planning to load the content once expanded with ajax
13:23  abracsi: x3rames, that's pretty awesome

13:24  x3rames: one of them is, but I guess once you start stacking them, it gets kind of weird
13:24  x3rames: haven't tried yet, though
13:25  abracsi: well the vertically nested accordion is what i'd be trying
13:25  abracsi: but this is scriptaculous, not jquery
13:25  SugaSlide: HAHAHA "your mom"
13:25  abracsi: i'm very happy to implement my own, i just wondered whether the basic accordion was set up for this somehow already
13:25  x3rames: yeah I took the first thing I found on google, just for a ui example
13:25  SugaSlide: she opens up on the web :D
13:28  x3rames: nicl, any error messages on the console or anything? a link to what you've got so far perhaps? ^^

13:32  guy: delete it and stop wasting your time
13:32  nicl: I'm using Drupal so can't rejig the HTML exactly as in the example - how strictly do I need to adhere to the code on the jquery site - ie. with the parent divs etc- or are they unimportant?
13:32  SugaSlide: thats not a bad suggestion
13:32  nicl: x3rames: I'm using Drupal so can't rejig the HTML exactly as in the example - how strictly do I need to adhere to the code on the jquery site - ie. with the parent divs etc- or are they unimportant?
13:33  x3rames: are you using this (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs)  as reference?
13:34  vpv4oo: given is one <img> with a src. how do i crossfade it to another src?
13:35  x3rames: vpv4oo: put another image on top (0 opacity), fade it in, delete the underlying image
13:36  nicl: x3rames: hey, html code is here: http://drupalbin.com/17173 Be prepared for a lot of rubbish though - Drupal adds a lot of mark-up
13:36  vpv4oo: stumbled upon this http://plugins.jquery.com/project/xfade  , but i dont think i can xfade by changing only the src...
13:36  x3rames: no you cannot, you have to use two images
13:37  vpv4oo: x3rames: if i wanted to crossfade between 10 images with your method i would be forced to have them all already loaded at the beginning, right?
13:37  x3rames: not at all, you can load them whenever you need them
13:38  x3rames: lets say you have a gallery for example, and want to crossfade between the images, you could load the first two on page load, and then go on from there
13:39  vpv4oo: i dont know which ones the first two are, the user decides that with his click
13:41  vpv4oo: so what i do is basically load a new <img> tag into my #wrapper div, then do the fade you explained. can i just load('<html>') into my div or am i required to have it presaved somewhere within a file?
13:42  x3rames: vpv4oo: I don't really get the second part of your question... whats with the "load(<html>)"? o.o
13:43  sean`: ?eval function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
13:43  bot-t: sean`: "lol"
13:43  vpv4oo: x3rames: the question is if i can directly load pure html code with load('<img ...>').. bacause if not i would have to have 1 file per img holding the appropriate img tag
13:44  x3rames: yeah of course you can do that. but perhaps you want to check on "preloading images" becuase if you put it in there directly without preloading, the fading may not look so good because the image won't be instantly available
13:46  vpv4oo: x3rames: okay, checking. many thanks
13:47  x3rames: nicl: not really sure why it doesn't work... any chance there is some javascript conflict thing going on?^^
13:48  nicl: x3rames: perhaps - the module which includes the jquery files is pretty buggy so maybe that is it...
13:48  nicl: x3rames: think I am going to look for another solution as I have been confused by this for too long! But thanks anyway

14:06  vpv4oo: x3rames: if i use this preloader http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript for the image and subsequently load('<img...>') will that be better than direct load()?

14:07  vpv4oo: or would i need to wait for the preloading to finish before load() ...as i understand the preloadimages() it will have the same result as only load()ing
14:10  binarious: Hi! I'm using the treeview plugin with cookie. When I reload the page, the path is opened correctly, but the collapse and expandable icons are wrong. Any ideas?
14:12  binarious: This is the result: http://www.dropmocks.com/mN52_
14:12  x3rames: vpv4oo: Personally I wouldn't use load() for images at all... not even show if it works. you want to let the browser do all the work here. the solution proposed by that link is actually pretty good, it only lacks a way to know if the image has been loaded yet
14:13  Arimil: binarious: if you want someone to help you debug your code a link to the code is helpful
14:14  Arimil: an image does not help
14:14  sean`: vpv4oo, .load is an event
14:15  x3rames: sean`: actually jQuery.load is also an AJAX shorthand xD

(alert seems to unminimized the broswer)
14:34  sean`: only prevent it when necessary

15:05  x3rames: and your ajax request for querying the time takes more than .5 seconds? that doesn't seem right :D
15:05  juno303: the problem is, the ajax request sometimes take more time...
15:06  juno303: i can measure the time of the request ?
15:06  x3rames: well, you could start a timer before starting the request,
15:06  hmbg: are there any guidelines for how to use jquery in a smart way, performance-wise?
15:06  x3rames: that is, query the clients time before the request, storing it, and after the request calculating CurrentTime-StoredTime
15:07  x3rames: then you have the time your request took
15:07  juno303: yes, but, the timer need to start when i receive the first data byte
15:07  juno303: not when the request has place
15:07  juno303: because the time of sending i need to avoid

15:08  juno303: is very dificult...
15:08  x3rames: its a very interesting question, though ^^
15:09  blackspotwiggins: juno303, it's very impractical to do this via http
15:09  x3rames: blackspotwiggins: sure is ^^
15:09  juno303: i can use NTP on jquery?

15:10  blackspotwiggins: oh that cant be good
15:11  x3rames: probably not :P but it looks funky
15:11  blackspotwiggins: probably its easier to not to try and sync timer starts, but adjust one or the other
15:12  x3rames: oh come on, your taking all the fun out :P

15:21  blackspotwiggins: hmm, seems that in 2036 there is one moment where real ntp is unusable
15:22  blackspotwiggins: vanillaslice, depends on the LAN i think?
15:22  rlinuxguy2: [
15:22  vanillaslice: blackspotwiggins: obviously .. 200 microS is as efficient as its going to get though

15:28  Miles8of9: just a question... i'm using the Sortable Jquery Ui widget.... obviously i must read the sorted items in some way and send them to the server.. how?
15:29  coachz: Can i send an action post with my jqgrid?  It's being sent as a query string currently,  is there an option to add it as a post var?   https://gist.github.com/49d8db2e04a35eab1cdd
15:30  Miles8of9: i seee jquery sortable widget uses an html list.... but UL can't be sent through post method
15:30  Miles8of9: so sortable component doesn't do anything?
15:31  SugaSlide: you serialize its results
15:31  Miles8of9: how?
15:31  SugaSlide: um not too sure
15:32  SugaSlide: used it a long time ago
15:32  erichynds: you can put inputs inside the list items
15:33  erichynds: sortable just sorts DOM elements

15:35  coachz: google fail

15:37  coachz: there is a data option
15:37  coachz: i can try that
15:37  Birliban: so generally, what is the better way to take ajax response from server, to use a json object and iterate the html in javascript/jquery or build the html on the server and send it back?
15:38  erichynds: coachz, looks like you should be able to do: ajaxGridOptions: { data: { "foo":"bar" } }

15:49  aitiba_: ji
15:49  rokcarl: so I'm using inputs, but when the user focuses on it, it is changed to a textarea and then back to input
15:49  twan_vdp: rokcarl you're able to modify the width and height
15:50  rokcarl: if I set it to 1 column, it is still two columns high
15:50  coachz: correct answer will move you into the lightning round where you can play for a vacation for two to puerta viarta !
15:50  rokcarl: twan_vdp: hmmm, right, gonna try that! (never thought of that :-/)
15:50  aitiba_: how can I do, when I click to an element (<a>) this element chane the color to red?
15:50  twan_vdp: take a textaera adn use $('textarea').focus(function(){ $(this).css('height','200px'); }).blur(function(){ $(this).css('height','20px'); })
15:50  rokcarl: twan_vdp: smart...

15:56  erichynds: i'm not sure
15:56  erichynds: i thought jqgrid would use $.extend but apparently not
15:57  coachz: ok, this jqgrid is becoming harder than i though
15:57  coachz: thought
15:57  coachz: i'm used to the yui one and this is similar but i can't figure out how to add an action to post
15:57  coachz: my php has an if statment that looks at actions passed so see what block of code to run
15:58  twan_vdp: rokcarl no ty
15:59  twan_vdp: bump) Can anyone tell me howto pass dictionaries due an AJAX call in jQuery ? Example: http://dpaste.com/294075/

16:28  ajpiano: $("#yourTable").delegate("tr","click",function(e) {});
16:28  ManxPower: SugaSlide, I was just typing up asking that.
16:28  SugaSlide: lol
16:28  SugaSlide: ajpiano getting all fancy :P
16:28  ajpiano: not fancy, performant
16:28  SugaSlide: ye
16:28  ManxPower: Keep It Simple For N00bs
16:29  temp01: both
16:29  ajpiano: not about simple
16:29  ajpiano: if oyu want to avoid binding 1000s of handlers
16:29  ajpiano: you should use delegate
16:29  SugaSlide: delegate is the highest performance
16:29  ManxPower: ajpiano, binding a .click to '#mytable tr' should work.
16:29  ajpiano: that also binds thousands of handlers
16:30  ajpiano: just in one line of code
16:30  ManxPower: oh 8-(
16:30  SugaSlide: ajpiano busy at the mo?
16:30  ajpiano: kinda ya
16:30  ManxPower: I guess I'll have to (again) try to understand delegation. 8-(
16:30  SugaSlide: hmm k
16:30  serio: he's at his new jawb
16:30  SugaSlide: o yeah :P forgot bout that
16:30  SugaSlide: congrats aj
16:30  SugaSlide: :D
16:31  SugaSlide: we demand details
16:31  temp01: there's nothing to understand
16:31  SugaSlide: :P
16:31  callumacrae: Can anyone answer my question from earlier?
16:31  callumacrae: at 15:14
16:31  temp01: just use delegate vs click ManxPower like ajpiano showed you
16:31  Kartel: Hi, 've got a problem with a script. I'd like to remove all br of a div children, but not the br of children child ....
16:31  temp01: callumacrae: link to site?
16:32  Kartel: I've wrote $("div.article").children().find('br').remove(); I thought it should work
16:32  timmywil: kartel: .children('br')
16:32  timmywil: without the find
16:32  callumacrae: temp01: http://lynxphp.com/ but I haven't got js.js up there
16:32  callumacrae: Everything else is up there though
16:32  ManxPower: temp01, *nod*  I'll give it a try.
16:33  Kartel: timmywil : outstanding, great. Can you explain why this is not working before ?
16:33  muhdik: hi
16:33  timmywil: kartel, children and find are the same except that children only goes one level down on the DOM tree
16:33  timmywil: ?children

16:33  Kartel: timmywil :
16:33  Kartel: ah right
16:33  temp01: couple of lines after your jquery include callumacrae

16:33  Kartel: timmywil : thx very much...
16:34  timmywil: np
16:34  muhdik: how do i count how many checkboxes i have checked when i am using css as selector?

16:34  callumacrae: seriously?!
16:34  callumacrae: I'm a fool
16:34  temp01: which means
16:34  callumacrae: -__-
16:34  muhdik: and i am using 2 selectors
16:34  temp01: $ == 1.4.4

16:34  stricjux: hello all!
16:35  callumacrae: So do I just want to get rid of the google cdn one?
16:35  clu3: hi all, how do i resolve the top HTML layer (such as jquery datepicker calendar) being not-visible by a .swf flash object on the page?
16:35  SugaSlide: ajpiano you full time with them?
16:35  SugaSlide: rofl pic
16:36  stricjux: I'm having some problems with JQ-UI buttons - Visual styles transfer when I clone the set but using .live("click",...) to change button state to disabled doesn't work anymore.
16:36  aitiba_: what is wrong here? $('.menu-item-344 a').addClass('current-menu-parent');
16:36  SugaSlide: stricjux you probably need to do a $("#btn").button("refresh")
16:36  aitiba_: jquery dont add me any new class to '.menu-item-344 a
16:36  Jonz: dscacheutil -flushcache
16:36  Jonz: uh.. mt
16:37  miketaylr: maybe there is no .menu-item-344 a, aitiba_
16:37  clu3: anyone have suggestions for my problem? I have a .swf object and a jquery datepicker and sometimes parts of the calendar are invisible due to the flash object underneath
16:37  aitiba_: miketaylr, yes there are http://www.aitoribanez.com/autonomo/proyecto/
16:38  SugaSlide: almost every pic aj has a diferent gun lol
16:39  miketaylr: wfm, aitiba_: http://miketaylr.com/post/6d34a1d6.png
16:39  serio: why add an arbitrary number like '344' to a class anyway?
16:39  Michael: ugh @ needing to give a swf an id attribute in a twice-cooked method
16:40  serio: what's an SWF? :D
16:40  muhdik: huh?
16:40  muhdik: ajpiano got  a job?
16:40  SugaSlide: lol no... judging by the pics... more a ... "not job"
16:41  Michael: And neither ufo nor swfobject passes in jslint so I can't use those
16:41  clu3: nvm, i fixed it by setting wmode='opaque'
16:42  aitiba_: miketaylr, on this function do the .css but not the .addClass
16:42  aitiba_: http://pastebin.com/2DMJ4ePZ
16:43  miketaylr: why are your selectors so different there, aitiba_?
16:43  miketaylr: $(this).find('a').addClass('whatever') should work too
16:44  stricjux: SugaSlide, tried using .button("refresh"), nothing happens
16:45  aitiba_: miketaylr, this line dont work
16:45  stricjux: SugaSlide, and the funny thing is that the onmouseover doesn't work on the cloned buttons.
16:45  miketaylr: wat
16:46  blackspotwiggins: SugaSlide, unless you deep clone, the event handlers are not cloned with it
16:46  stricjux: blackspotwiggins, how do I deep clone?
16:46  phrearch: hey
16:46  seutje: but deep cloning sounds so perverted :(
16:46  aitiba_: miketaylr, this code http://pastebin.com/ybDzYhaX dont work on my site
16:46  blackspotwiggins: err yeah, clone(true) should take data with it
16:46  phrearch: if i do a $(".sf-menu").delegate("a", "click", function(event){ then only a elements within .sf-menu should be triggered right?
16:47  callumacrae: temp01: There something else disagreeing with jQuery
16:47  callumacrae: My localhost doesn't have the second jQuery
16:47  erichynds: wat
16:47  Jonz: phreach, why not just use a context in a single selector
16:48  temp01: callumacrae: well, upload the real thing somewhere
16:48  seutje: aitiba_: try http://pastebin.com/s32iG3Q3
16:48  phrearch: Jonz: ?
16:49  Jonz: phrearch, nevermind, your code looks like it should do what you think it does
16:49  callumacrae: temp01: This is the only other js http://lynxphp.com/wp-content/plugins/syntaxhighlighter-plus/syntaxhighlighter/src/shCore.js
16:49  phrearch: Jonz: ok thanks
16:49  temp01: callumacrae: any errors in console?
16:49  aitiba_: seutje, dont work
16:50  stricjux: blackspotwiggins, thnx... Now buttons are fully cloned, with onmouseover events.

16:50  Qci: nope
16:50  callumacrae: ... It just started working
16:51  blackspotwiggins: lol Qci
16:51  callumacrae: I hate it when that happens
16:51  stricjux: blackspotwiggins, but I'm now having problems with .live('click',....) that is bound to the buttons - clicking on a button now disables the original button instead of the clicked one.
16:51  Qci: somthing that ajpiano answer before about native javascript
16:52  SugaSlide: lol firefox with 3 tabs open
16:52  SugaSlide: 1.7 gigs of ram used
16:52  blackspotwiggins: stricjux, you usually dont have to clone live handlers
16:52  blackspotwiggins: if you are doing things correctly
16:52  serio: SugaSlide, you're doing it wrong
16:52  SugaSlide: opera with a min of 30 tabs open... 295
16:52  serio: Chrome :)
16:52  blackspotwiggins: you guys just need more ram, is all
16:52  SugaSlide: im testing in firefox
16:52  SugaSlide: i have 6 gigs
16:52  stricjux: blackspotwiggins, I know, but I guess you clone them automagicaly if I clone(true)?
16:52  SugaSlide: its not impacting the system... just wierd
16:53  SugaSlide: ROFL
16:53  SugaSlide: i close firefox...
16:53  SugaSlide: and the ram usage goes up
16:53  SugaSlide: the process doesnt stop
16:53  stricjux: blackspotwiggins, anyways - the $(this) in firebug is showing the right object, but the .button("option","disable",true) targets the other object
16:53  phrearch: hm it seems like the element for the delegate needs to exist first before the delegate works?
16:53  phrearch: $(".main > #wiki-content").delegate("a", "click", function(event){
16:54  blackspotwiggins: stricjux, i have no context with your issue, sorry
16:54  phrearch: .main works, but .main in the case of a special case doesnt
16:54  aitiba_: seutje, miketaylr any ideas of how can I fix this?
16:54  temp01: phrearch: yes, that's how it works
16:57  phrearch: temp01: found a work-around: $(".main").delegate("#wiki-content a", "click", function(event){
16:57  sean``: http://jsfiddle.net/H9x7c/show/ == http://gyazo.com/ab5eb5f540130477d349746f8fb33ff0.png ?
16:57  temp01: phrearch: it's not a workaround...
16:58  phrearch: no, i guess its regular use :-)
16:58  phrearch: i havent used delegates much yet
17:01  juha__: using jquery mobile, is it possible to disable ajax calls for all links? like adding "disable-ajax" etc to data/somewhere?
17:02  ablomen: juha_, http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/#docs/api/globalconfig.html << see ajaxLinksEnabled
17:03  juha__: ablomen: the problem is that it's either all on or all of.. as i want couple of my links to be normal links (like logout), but then i want the fancypancy links for the rest..

17:04  ablomen: juha_, yeah i know the problem, i just hacked something into the source myself, might be the best options for now, there isnt anything else in the docs about it anyway
17:05  seutje: aitiba_: this is like pin the tail on the donkey!
17:05  juha__: ablomen: ugh.. ok, maybe i'll just disable ajax links completely for now and enable them when there are better options..
17:06  callumacrae: I'm confused

17:28  jkies00: hi all, is there a way i can remove all event handlers on a link based on if that link has a 'disabled' class?
17:29  stricjux: Could somebody please help me with .clone(true) and .button("option","disabled") - seems that clone(true) causes the .button("option"....) getter to get information from original button instead of the new object
17:32  jkies00: i have a screen with a few different a tag buttons on it.  by applying a 'disabled' class to the button, i can give it a style that makes it look disabled.  i was hoping to write a handler for that 'disabled' class that would override any functionality already bound to that element, as long as the 'disabled' class is on that elmeent
17:32  jQnub: Looking for some help, trying to write jQuery that makes images 70% transparent and when you click on them they go 100%, but if you click on another image it turns back to 70% and the new image is then 100%
17:33  tbeseda: jkies00: you can check in their click/change handlers to see if their class is disabled and then return false
17:34  randomOfAmber: if you select something ($('.something')) and do something to it($('.something').removeClass('someClass')), and it doesn't exist, is this a problem? should I wrap it in an if block?
17:35  jQnub: ill try that tbeseda
17:35  jkies00: tbeseda , yes i could do that - but then i have to make that check in every handler for every button.  that would certainly work, but i was hoping i could temporarily override all the handlers so that i could write one function to intercept a click on any button with the 'disabled' class
17:36  tbeseda: jkies00: I see, well if you attach two handlers to the same object, they will both fire. so, you're right, you'll have to unbind them. do you add the disabled class with js?
17:37  tbeseda: when you add the class you can unbind events with .unbind()
17:43  zChris: Hi, is there a chance one could get some helpt with http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/#tab-Testing in here?
17:43  jkies00: tbeseda sometimes the diabled class is added by js, depending on the state of the screen.  the primary scenario is that the button starts out with the disable class hardcoded into the markup, and then the class is removed once certain conditions are met
17:44  danktamagachi: Hey, I know this isn't the place for this, but I was hoping somebody may be able to help me... I'm looking to create an apache rewrite rule to turn www.domain.com/foo/1 into www.domain.com/foo.php?bar=1
17:45  ManxPower: danktamagachi, have you tried #apache
17:45  danktamagachi: still waiting for the automated list of support channels that posts in #apache every 15 minutes

17:47  jQnub: can you call focus on an image? I am trying to make a single image 100% opaque, but when it is not clicked or another image is clicked the image is 70% opaque
17:49  ralphholzmann: jQnub: I would manipulate classes
17:49  ralphholzmann: rather than try and "focus" a typically non-focusable element
17:50  jQnub: ralph: so how do I make the class only show up on a clicked image, but that image will lose the class when I click on another image
17:50  ralphholzmann: jQnub: I'll write you up a quick demo
17:51  jQnub: ralph: thanks
17:51  temp01: I think you can add tabindex to make an element focusable but I dunno how well it works cross-browser
17:54  ralphholzmann: jQnub: something like this - http://jsfiddle.net/VAjgz/
17:54  jQnub: ralph: thanks!
17:54  mokush: can I make cross-domain requests using $.ajax if the sever send the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header?
17:55  supsup: zChris: prob because you have no values on your inputs.
17:56  zChris: supsup: alright i give it a shot
17:57  tbeseda: mokush: no, the browser still won't like it
17:57  mokush: tbeseda: why not? :(
17:57  zChris: supsup, nope still not working :/
17:57  tbeseda: mokush: JSONP is the way to go. pretty much the only way to sidestep standard domain origin policies
17:58  mokush: tbeseda: well I have to get xml from an already constructed web service, so there's no way to use jsonp
17:58  mokush: tbeseda: but why doesn't Access-Control-Allow-Origin work as it's supposed to?
18:01  tbeseda: mokush: not sure. maybe some testing is needed.

18:37 --- SpankyFromBRC is now known as spanktar
18:40  x3rames: well, I don't know any guides, really, but most (if not all) the plugins I know, just use a separate language file they load depending on which language is currently selected. and where a language string is needed, the do something like $.i18n(
18:40  x3rames: $.i18n('identifierString')
18:41  x3rames: where $.i18n is a function you can easily write in a couple of lines, some lookup within a dictionary, for the id string
18:42  x3rames: if you want several levels in the dictionary just split it with dots or something -> identifier.string
18:45  Snerf: with $.ajax, what does it mean if the error reports a status=0 ?
18:46 --- seutje is now known as frigginCommute
18:47  macagua: x3rames: thanks for your answer, I think so you guide is useful for this code https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/banjo/trunk/js/banjo.js
18:53  macagua: x3rames: this application using Python, Jquery and HTML, then I will use for support i18n on python i18ndude, for Jquery a plugins as you said me but the HTML files (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/banjo/trunk/index.html) need translate is possible across Jquery manipulate this HTML String?
18:55  x3rames: yeah you probably could do that, but I guess it would be a real pain... is that static html? because I'd rather say you should go get some kind of templating, and then set your language markers in the HTML template and replace them with whatever you are using (taking i18ndude as the source, I guess)
18:56  macagua: x3rames: yes it's a static HTML

19:01  carbonhat: I'm building a feature such that when you click a little colored square, it changes the parent div's background to the color of the clicked square. For a set of a dozen colors, is there any method easier than "if ( $this.hasClass('yellow') ) { $this.parent().addClass('yellow'); } else if ( $this.hasClass('purple') ) { $this.parent().addClass('purple') } etc. etc. etc."
19:02  x3rames: how about $this.parent().addClass($this.class))
19:02  x3rames: not correct, but you get the idea?
19:02  carbonhat: x3rames - I'd love to do that, except the little color boxes have class="colorbox yellow", etc.
19:02  carbonhat: i need the 'yellow' part, but not the 'colorbox' part
19:02  carbonhat: i know i could split(' ')
19:03  carbonhat: but that doesn't work further down the line when i'm trying to save state
19:03  x3rames: well then you could prefix your bg colors like bg_yellow or something, write a small function that extracts the bg_* class it, and bingo ^^
19:03  carbonhat: ahhh
19:03  carbonhat: that's a great idea - would a regex be the best way to extract the bg_ classes?
19:04  carbonhat: or is there a simpler way?
19:05 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
19:05  Ely2: Hornet-
19:05  x3rames: I would just substr the part you expect
19:05  x3rames: for example
19:05  x3rames: substring the first 3
19:05  x3rames: if you search for bg_
19:05  x3rames: and then compare against bg_
19:05  x3rames: ^^
19:06  x3rames: regex tend to be slow, even though I don't know if such a simple one may even be faster ...
19:07  carbonhat: sweet - this is brilliant! is there a built-in jQuery function for something like $this.class().each() or will i need to roll my own function to iterate through all the classes on an element?
19:07  x3rames: not sure ^^ that you will have to find out for yourself :P
19:07  carbonhat: lol - will do
19:07  carbonhat: thanks a ton, x3rames !
19:07  vacho: jQuery('irc://irc.freenode.net/#facebook-like').delay(5000).css('visibility', 'visible'); why does it not wait 5 sec to set the visibility property?

19:11  l4rk: vacho: what the fff
19:11  vacho: stupid irc client.. jQuery('irc://irc.freenode.net/#facebook-like').delay(5000).css('visibility', 'visible');
19:12  bot-t: vacho, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
19:12  erichynds: wat?
19:12  l4rk: vacho: why are you passing an irc url into the jquery object
19:12  l4rk: i'm so cofnused
19:12  erichynds: delay doesn't work like that
19:12  vacho: l4rk: its a secret
19:12  l4rk: keep it a secret, i'm already getting a headache from how retarded that looks
19:12  vacho: ericbarnes: then how do I do it?

19:16  erichynds: no it won't
19:16  x3rames: it does
19:16  x3rames: I tested it ^^
19:16  erichynds: delay only works in between queues
19:16  x3rames: yeah so?
19:16  erichynds: that line by its lonesome won't work
19:17  erichynds: it isn't inbetween a queue
19:17  x3rames: http://jsfiddle.net/aFnMP/
19:17  x3rames: it does
19:17  x3rames: new effect queue is created, the delay is inserted, then the fadeOut effect is inserted
19:17  x3rames: which has to wait for the dela
19:17  x3rames: y

19:19  x3rames: the delay is, internally, just an effext the does nothing, isnt it?
19:19  erichynds: x3rames, delay creates the queue
19:19  erichynds: no, it uses setTimeout
19:19  solars: can anyone recommend one of the wizard plugins?
19:19  x3rames: of course, but all the effects do that
19:20  x3rames: so its just a 1 step effect without doing anything useful, then the queue continues
19:20  carbonhat: so I found the jQuery(attribute*="substr") selector in the API, but am having trouble figuring out how to return the 'THE CLASS NAME CONTAINING "man"' bit in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/wkMS8/
19:20  x3rames: or at least that is how I thought the jquery effect queue worked
19:20  carbonhat: in other words, I can select the input that matches, but I want to return the actual full class name

19:24  x3rames: carbonhat: unfortunately you can't do that with css selectors, they only tell you that the element has that substring somewhere, not which class it actually is or anything
19:24  carbonhat: d'oh - okay, i'll try to attack from a different angle

19:31  kelye: hello
19:31  kelye: guys, how can i fake an event?
19:32  peol: ? trigger @ kelye
19:32  bot-t: kelye, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
19:33  kelye: not that simple :) , i have a calculator like design with a top input text and when i click (mouse click) on the digits i want to trigger keypress on the input text
19:33  kelye: because it has some special formating triggered by keydown/press
19:33  Solow: Funny question, is there any kind of xml listqwith jquery plugins out there? api.jquery.com doesnt supply one. :(
19:33  kelye: is there a way to build the event and declare the keycode myself? and pass it somehow to trigger?
19:34  erichynds: kelye, inside the keypress handler, check if the event.which property equals the key you want
19:35  Techdeck: hey guys, if I have 3 divs, <div class="1 main" title="a"><div class="2" title="b"><div class="3" title="c"></div></div></div> -- all I currently have as a selector is $(".3") -- how can I find the main div using that?
19:35  Techdeck: other than using .parent().parent()
19:35  Techdeck: is there a way to search upwards?
19:36  l4rk: ?parents @ Techdeck
19:36  bot-t: Techdeck, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
19:36  l4rk: ?closest @ Techdeck
19:36  bot-t: Techdeck, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
19:36  Techdeck: .closest! awesome, thanks l4rk!
19:36  l4rk: np
19:37  kelye: erichynds: thanks, as usual... after asking someone you find the answer .. :))
19:37  kelye: jQuery.Event('keypress;) crates an event :)
19:37  kelye: how can i find what keyCode a number has ?
19:38  l4rk: kelye: jQuery.Event creates an event object
19:38  l4rk: not an event
19:38  kelye: like keyCode(backspace) = 39
19:38  kelye: yes, that's what i need
19:38  kelye: and i will pass the object to my script
19:38  l4rk: oh you want to set the keyCode
19:38  l4rk: on the event object
19:38  kelye: yes :)
19:38  l4rk: you need to manually figure that out
19:38  l4rk: and set that
19:39  l4rk: or actually bind to a key event and read it dynamically from that
19:39  kelye: ok, thanks, will try
19:40  Ely2: Hornet- are you here?
19:40  keith27: kelye if your event is triggered by backspace and you want it triggered by click can't you just change it at that point instead of faking a trigger or whatever
19:41  kelye: my event is triggered by clicking on button div's with a windows calculator look
19:42  keith27: why do you need to send backspace? what are you trying to do
19:42  kelye: it was an example, backspace is never used
19:42  kelye: 0-9
19:43  erichynds: why do you need to create your own event object in the first place?
19:43  erichynds: instead of triggering the handler
19:43  Nicolas_Leonidas: hey
19:43  Nicolas_Leonidas: what does "this" mean here? $('#reg_login').keyup(function() { username_all_checks(this,''); });
19:43  Nicolas_Leonidas: is it the #reg_login or this document? or what else?
19:44  kelye: and how would triggering the handler (when no key was pressed) will help me?
19:44  erichynds: #reg_login DOM element
19:44  kelye:  i have to send an  event to the handler
19:44  ManxPower: I'm trying to access the value of the id= when I click on an element.  I must have been away from JS for too long (I'm stilla n00b), but I thought something like ${'this id').val(); would do it.
19:44  serio: anytime 'this' is referenced within an event handler it's refering the DOM element triggering the event
19:44  gnarf: ?caching
19:44  bot-t: Even when you're creating a jQuery object out of an element you'll just be using once, you should always cache. Otherwhise you won't end up in heaven. http://blog.seankoole.com/qotd-why-should-you-cache-when-using-jquery
19:44  serio: *to*
19:45  erichynds: kelye, and the handler uses the event obj and delegates based on the key pressed or something?
19:45  Nicolas_Leonidas: erichynds: thanks
19:45  kelye: yes
19:45  cohitre: ? attr @ ManxPower
19:45  bot-t: ManxPower, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
19:45  erichynds: kelye, so if event.which is null, it'll be the same thing as spoofing an event.. just test for it and act accordingly
19:46  ManxPower: cohitre, thanks, that's what I was looking for.

19:52  ManxPower: am I doing it wrong or is something else amiss?
19:53  pender: ManxPower: It's always $(this) never $('this') unless you have a <this /> tag
19:54  gnarf: does .attr('disabled', false) work reliably ? (i know .removeAttr('disabled') is suggested)
19:54  ManxPower: pender, thanks, I tried that first.  Maybe my HTML is messed up and it is not generating the id=
19:54  pender: gnarf: Depends more on browsers.
19:54  gnarf: pender: do you know a browser it doesn't work in?
19:54  pender: ManxPower: In FF try a console.log($(this)) to see if you even are finding the element.
19:55  kelye: ok, just wanted to let you know it works fine by creating an event object
19:55  kelye: and passing it to trigger

19:56  pender: gnarf: Nope, but I wouldn't assume <input disabled /> === <input disabled="disabled" />
19:56  solars: hey, is there a plugin, that allows "marking" text segments on a page?
19:56  ManxPower: pender, $(this) shows up in the console, should there be an "id" entry?
19:57  pender: ManxPower: Does the actual element appear like <mytag /> or do  you actually see "$(this)" (just makin' sure!)
19:57  ManxPower: I have something like <tr id="123">
19:57  pender: ManxPower: Yeah, you should see the element with the ID (if it has one)
19:57  mindtonic: I have a question about draggable and droppable using jquery ui.  How do I get the value of my draggable object from within the drop formula?  .val() is returning nil
19:57  queso: How do I prevent an enter in a textbox from submitting the form?
19:58  gnarf: pender: actualy, not for $(this) unless you have firequery
19:58  gnarf: then you'll see jQuery( <element> )
19:58  ManxPower: pender, the element shows + [Window user].  I click on the + and it lists things like add, addClass, length, selector.
19:58  gnarf: console.log($(this).get()) would log the elements without firequery
19:58  cohitre: ManxPower: under what context are you using $(this).attr('id')  ?
19:58  ManxPower: there is no element in the list "id"
19:59  pender: gnarf: stand corrected :)
19:59  cohitre: the context for `this` is different when you use the firebug console
20:00  ManxPower: cohitre, Context?  I have a table.  I am using delegate to set a custom click handler for each row on the table.   In that handler I need to access the id of the clicked row so I can get the customer number.
20:00  gnarf: ManxPower: if you are getting the window, its likely your "this" isn't what your expecting... can you paste the code showing where you are doing the console.log ?
20:00  cohitre: ? paste @ ManxPower
20:00  bot-t: ManxPower, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
20:01  gnarf: ManxPower: "context" is a fancy way of saying "what is 'this'?"  JavaScript functions are called from a "context" -  a jQuery event handler calls its functions in the context of the element bound
20:02  ManxPower: standby
20:03  pender: ManxPower: You're looking for something like $('tr').click(function() { alert('My ID is: ' + $(this).attr('id')); });

20:10  gnarf: ManxPower: actually...
20:10  x3rames: shintaku: doesn't firebug or something tell you that in the request section?
20:10  gnarf: ManxPower: the "this" isn't magically passed to showContextMenu
20:10  gnarf: you are calling that function in the context of the window
20:10  shintaku: yeah, but i need to handle it in code
20:11  gnarf: since "ShowContextMenu" is already accepting the "e" param
20:11  gnarf: why not just pass it?
20:11  x3rames: ah okay sorry ^^ I thought you just needed to know
20:11  gnarf: .delegate('td', 'click', ShowContextMenu)
20:11  gnarf: also, its $(this) not $('this')
20:12  ManxPower: gnarf, I'm a n00b, would that pass this to the ShowContextMenu?
20:12 * gnarf nods at ManxPower --- Your function is already an event handler, use it like oe
20:12  gnarf: there is another way
20:12  ManxPower: gnarf, since I don't know much about event handlers.....
20:13  gnarf: function(e) { ShowContextMenu.call(this, e); }
20:13  gnarf: that calls ShowContextMenu in the context of 'this' (whatever it happens to be) with an argument of e
20:13  ManxPower: gnarf, that seems more explicit and easer for me to understand in 6 weeks. 8-)
20:14  gnarf: ManxPower: yeah, but that function does nothing but call ShowContextMenu
20:14  gnarf: so you might as well just pass ShowContextMenu as your event handler
20:14  ManxPower: JS is not the primary focus of the project, the server back end is.  Someday someone that actually knows JS will take over the JS part.
20:14  gnarf: .delegate('td', 'click', ShowContextMenu)
20:14  gnarf: note no ()
20:14  ManxPower: Right, but "e" goes not exist in ShowContextMenu then
20:15  gnarf: yeah it does
20:15  gnarf: function ShowContextMenu(e)
20:15  gnarf: is the same as function(e)
20:15  ManxPower: gnarf, that must be magical to event handlers?

20:20  Fernandos: gnarf: in a price-range slider and some other form controls how would I do that?
20:20  Fernandos: esp. without annoying users
20:21  gnarf: Fernandos: well, i assume you are queueing a request to "update" the results as they slide?
20:21  Fernandos: indeed
20:21  gnarf: there is no reason to hold more than 1 request in that queue
20:22  vacho: what are your favorite plugins?
20:22  Fernandos: maybe release the request when a user leaves a specific region with the mouse?
20:22  gnarf: the one running currently, and the "most recent"
20:22  gnarf: so, i would "empty" the queue before inserting the "newest"
20:23  gnarf: Fernandos: what are you using to queue the ajax request?
20:23  Fernandos: gnarf: currently I'm not queing it, I was researching it, I was looking into redis
20:24  libertiy: hi everyone good wishes for new year
20:24  gnarf: Fernandos: http://l3.sphotos.l3.fbcdn.net/hphotos-l3-snc6/hs067.snc6/167740_1809417835668_1246642480_32119695_5138748_n.jpg
20:24  Fernandos: I thought if many users simultanously slide back and forth it could look like a DDoS
20:24  gnarf: oops
20:24  gnarf: wrong paste
20:24  gnarf: http://www.jsfiddle.net/Fwcbj/4/light/
20:24  libertiy: anyone can advise me  simple. good jquery menu plugin?
20:24  Fernandos: gnarf wtf was that?
20:24  gnarf: Fernandos: a pic from new years eve :)
20:24  libertiy: to create dropdowns, i known suckerfish, superfish but i wonder if there is anything smaller and less features just a simple dropdown is enough and cross browser
20:24  gnarf: check the fiddle
20:25  Fernandos: k
20:25  pender: libertiy: css, a list, and position:absolute
20:25  gnarf: that is a short example of using jquery's .queue to queue ajax
20:26  gnarf: lemme add an 'empty' method for you
20:26  Fernandos: hmm
20:27  gnarf: Fernandos: http://www.jsfiddle.net/bLWTN/
20:27  Fernandos: I just thought how would it be if I additionally fire the queue after a specific timeout?
20:28  Fernandos: does that make sense to clear the queue if there was another slider before the timeout
20:28  gnarf: Fernandos: same slider?
20:28  Fernandos: yes
20:28  gnarf: if so, why pass an "old" value
20:28  gnarf: to the server?
20:28  Fernandos: yes
20:29  Fernandos: it would be even more cleverer to fire only one query to the server and filter the cached html localy only
20:29  gnarf: probably
20:29  JonMarkGo: gnarf: It says that origHtml is undefined when it gets to replace
20:30  gnarf: JonMarkGo: what version of jQuery?
20:30  Fernandos: but I don't know howto do that.. though I would like learn howto do that..
20:30  gnarf: ?.html(function)#sid
20:30  bot-t: .html(function): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/#sid

20:31  gnarf: thats a 1.4 thing
20:31  gnarf: try $outerElem.html($outerElem.html().replace(....
20:32  Fernandos: hmm I think I could work with the queries data when I could somehow get cached or so...
20:33  coachz: Anyone know how to return a hidden field in jqGrid when onSelectRow fires ?
20:33  gnarf: Fernandos: realistically, your original html page could include all results, then you could filter those results based on the html
20:34  Fernandos: hmm..
20:35  gnarf: Fernandos: you could use <div class='result' data-price='2323.23'>
20:35  Fernandos: yes I just thought about using the data element too :)
20:36  gnarf: then $results.find('div').each(function() { var $this = $(this), price = parseFloat($this.attr('data-price')); if (price<min || price>max) $this.hide() else $this.show(); });
20:36  Fernandos: wow thank you! that would be the part where I could struggle.. have only filtered by the data attribute once
20:37  Fernandos: hahah that's what I call iterative enhancement. enhancing a stupid idea I had until there something clever in the end
20:39  JonMarkGo: gnarf - Still says its undefined
20:39  JonMarkGo: Maybe $(this) is messed

20:54  JonMarkGo: Oh weird
20:54  JonMarkGo: It works in firefox but no chrome
20:55 * gnarf shrugs
20:56  JonMarkGo: Well ,thanks, I guess I'll try to figure out this chrome thing
20:58  coachz: Anyone here use jqGrid ?
21:00  Gar_onn: JonMarkGo: why dont you do:
21:00  Gar_onn: $('math').each(function() { $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/<mml:/ig, '<'));});
21:00  coachz: what's the purpose of id:  in the jsonReader in jqGrid ?
21:02  Guest50861: coachz: its the name of the column that identify the row
21:02 --- Guest50861 is now known as Cork[home]
21:03  coachz: Cork,   can i access it directly or do i need to add it to the colModel ?
21:03  Cork[home]: what do you mean?
21:03  coachz: sec
21:04  coachz: https://gist.github.com/76d088588827fc9d517b     see line 34 onSelectRow, i want to access the id (line 27)
21:04  coachz: currently i add it on line 8 and 11
21:05  coachz: when i click a row i want to return the row including that id
21:05  Cork[home]: coachz: ya, thats how its meant to be done, if thats what you ask?
21:06  coachz: so what is id:  buying me?
21:06 * Cork[home] still doesn't get what the question is...
21:06  coachz: what is it telling the jsonreader ?
21:06  Cork[home]: coachz: jqgrid needs it to be able to give you the rowid in the select row
21:06  coachz: but rowid seems to just be a counter
21:06  Cork[home]: its "what column will identify the row"
21:07  QWeb: Hi guys
21:07  coachz: ok, well i guess i'm on the right track,  thank you Cork
21:08  Cork[home]: coachz: http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:retrieving_data#json_data
21:08  coachz: yeah i read that
21:08  QWeb: I'm looking for an example of a jQuery powered gallery that where when you hover over an image, it grows and the other images spread out to make room. Not sure what to search for though... Any ideas?
21:08  coachz: didn't get what id is really doing though
21:09  Cork[home]: coachz: it does have a function, though i haven't used jqgrid for over a year
21:10  pender: QWeb: Didn't Google *just* have something like that on their homepage?
21:10  Cork[home]: simplest way to find these things i found was to read the source
21:10  coachz: thanks Cork  i'll keep going :-)
21:10  QWeb: pender, they had something similar yes, but I need the images to spread out so that nothing overlaps but without looking boxed
21:11  pender: QWeb: Good luck :P
21:11  QWeb: pender, lol thanks
21:13  disappearedng: Hey if I want to have row that has only 1 td inside a table, it's like a header for date, what should I be using?
21:13  vacho: how do I add html to a div using jquery?
21:13  Cork[home]: disappearedng: colspan
21:13  pender: vacho: $('div#myid').html('<h1>hello!</h1>');;
21:14  vacho: pender: i did that.. will that erase all the html already existing in the div?
21:14  JonMarkGo: So there's this weird bug where webkit changes the formatting of certain elements. I want to wrap these elements in a script tag BEFORE webkit touches them, but running my jquery code on document.ready doesn't seem to do it - Is there a way I can run it sooner?
21:14  Cork[home]: vacho: yes it will
21:14  pender: vacho: yep.
21:14  Cork[home]: vacho: use .append or .prepend if you want to add to the content
21:14  pender: vacho: use .append() to add content
21:15  Cork[home]: heh
21:15  pender: damnit!
21:15  Cork[home]: JonMarkGo: "change format" ?
21:16  JonMarkGo: Not sure how to explain it
21:16  Cork[home]: make a minimal example in ex. fiddle is a good start :P
21:17  JonMarkGo: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=61672
21:17  JonMarkGo: Thats the bug report about it
21:17  JonMarkGo: A possible fix is to wrap your mathml in a <script> tag, which I'm doing, but not soon enough..
21:17  JonMarkGo: I just need to run my code before document.ready
21:18  Cork[home]: oh mathml
21:18  Cork[home]: JonMarkGo: i don't think you can fix it with js, if you don't replace the entire content
21:19  Cork[home]: the parsing is already done, and its prob where the bug happens
21:19  Cork[home]: (else i can't see how <script> could help)

21:26 --- webflo1 is now known as webflo
21:26  Cork[home]: vokoda: yes, but you would have to do the string magic your self
21:26  eTiger13: vokoda: not easily. some browsers are getting text selection now but not a lot
21:27  Cork[home]: eTiger13: actually all browsers support it
21:27  vokoda: Cork[home]: is that along the lines of: get selected text string, search string, add tags at location
21:27  Cork[home]: at least if you could ies + other browsers for the last 3 years
21:27  Cork[home]: vokoda: you can get selection start and end position
21:28  vokoda: Cork[home]: oh right? relative to what?
21:28  Cork[home]: vokoda: the element
21:28  vokoda: Cork[home]: great, is that a jQuery function?
21:28  Cork[home]: no
21:29  Cork[home]: so it will differ for ie and the other browsers
21:29  jkies00: thanks bot-t  and eTiger13 i will check those out

21:36  Cork[home]: i'm banging my head ageanst this for hours now :s
21:37  jkies00: eTiger13 - i can't get this to work: $('#completion.disabled')  -  is this a legit selector?  where can i find more info on a combined selector like that?
21:38  Cork[home]: jkies00: if its an element with the id="completion" class="disabled" then ya, thats correct
21:38  Cork[home]: and its valid

21:44  Cork[home]: vacho: browsers normally save files sent as bit streams
21:44  maestrojed: Sorry, it was meant to be a question. Should 1.2.6 still work in FF3.6, IE8, Chrome, etc.
21:45  Cork[home]: vacho: and they normally save things sent with the attachment header (its the way to set filenames in generated content)
21:45  maestrojed: ?
21:45  eTiger13: maestrojed: if i say no will you upgrade?
21:45  maestrojed: eTiger13, no
21:45  maestrojed: :)_
21:45  Cork[home]: vacho: theres a backside to the php solution though, it wil fill your servers buffer with the image, so its heavy for the server to do
21:45  maestrojed: eTiger13: At this point upgrading jQuery would have many rippling effects. It is on the slate but not right now
21:46  Cork[home]: vacho: so the best solution is through .htaccess
21:46  eTiger13: maestrojed: then what are you asking?
21:46  eTiger13: maestrojed: if you arent going to upgrade then it doesnt matter what it is compatible with

22:00  Brodingo: UGH D5??
22:00  maestrojed: I identified the issue (I think). jQuery is running in noConflict but the CMS (drupal) does not expect it to be.
22:00  maestrojed: Brodingo: I know, its an older site.
22:01  Brodingo: sorry bro thats rough
22:01  maestrojed: yeah, I need to figure out where and how jQuery is being told to use NoConflict

22:12  marcamillion: I don't need all that fancy stuff, all i want to be able to do is to detect if a hash is used on the url
22:12  solars: erichynds, http://flowplayer.org/tools/overlay/index.html also quite nice
22:12  gnarf: its available as soon as it is loaded
22:12  gnarf: but if you want to detect when the hash changes
22:12  marcamillion: hrmm....
22:12  gnarf: you will want to use bbq's hashchange event
22:12  marcamillion: then I will need something more powerful
22:12  marcamillion: i see
22:13  justinhjohnson: bbq is light and easy to implement
22:13  marcamillion: but it also does LOTS of other things, that I don't need
22:13  gnarf: marcamillion: it probably doesn't use any of them unless you use them
22:13  justinhjohnson: then strip it down?
22:13  gnarf: :)
22:13  marcamillion: and I rather keep the app lighter and find a way to do it without using plugins
22:14  ajpiano: marcamillion, if (window.location.hash)
22:14  eTiger13: marcamillion:  what do you have against plugins?
22:14  Cork[home]: eTiger13: one sec
22:14 --- Guest68308 is now known as gf3
22:14  ajpiano: ?reinvent @ marcamillion
22:14  bot-t: marcamillion, We will not help you reinvent the wheel if we recommend using the many wheels already available. If you choose to make your own, you're on your own.
22:14  eTiger13: ben_alman:  any chance you could add a size description for your plugins?
22:14  maestrojed: So something on my site (drupal) is making jquery run in noConflict. I have grep searched the most likely files and could find "noconflict". I am search all files but that will take a while. Any way to ask jquery why its running in noconflict? Like, hey jquery where did you get the attribute to run in noconflict?
22:15  Cork[home]: eTiger13: no, i meant detecting ix the content of the td is px wider the then td
22:15  ben_alman: size description?
22:15  Denis: Let's talk about just.
22:15  marcamillion: oh interesting... ben_alman is in here
22:15  marcamillion: cool
22:15  Cork[home]: *if the content
22:15  eTiger13: maestrojed: like i said, view source and search for noconlict. quick
22:15  gnarf: maestrojed: did you search case insensitive for "noconflict" ?
22:15  eTiger13: ben_alman:  like on the plugins showing the size in kb of the plugin
22:15  gnarf: cuz its "noConflict"
22:15  maestrojed: eTiger13: Done, no reference.
22:15  maestrojed: gnarf: I will check the case
22:15  Denis: Select the file.
22:16  Denis: jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library
22:16  Denis: Create a new Fiddle - jsFiddle - Online Editor for the Web (JavaScript, MooTools, jQuery, Prototype, YUI, Glow and Dojo, HTML, CSS)
22:16  eTiger13: maestrojed: did you look in all the js files as well?
22:16  ajpiano: Denis: wtf are you doing
22:16  Cork[home]: eTiger13: and one of the criterias is not to copy the text into a hidden node (as its dead slow)
22:16  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  change .text to .html and itll do it
22:16  marcamillion: nothing against your plugin man....I would just rather not use a plugin if I don't have to
22:17  gnarf: maestrojed: or just make sure your jQuery code is wrapped in a (function($) { ... })(jQuery)
22:17  gnarf: to reassign the $ to jQuery
22:17  Denis: ajpiano: Joyride laboratories nikkI and the online version is kept automatically updated.
22:17  ajpiano: Denis: what????
22:17  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  maybe then wrap the .html of the tds in a div, change to position absolute and then get the size and then unwrap?
22:17  maestrojed: eTiger13: I searched the folders that typically contain the JS files. I did not find a reference to noconflict. Its a big CMS so its possible there are js files in other places. I am trying to do a full search but it will take a while.
22:18  eTiger13: Denis: are you a real person?
22:18  Cork[home]: eTiger13: ya, but... thats the second criteria i set up :)
22:18  maestrojed: gnarf: This is a CMS. The jquery code is not consolidated. It would be a large undertaking to find all jquery functions and convert them to use jquery instead of $
22:18 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o Corey]
22:18 --- Corey sets modes [#jquery +q *!*@c83-254-66-66.bredband.comhem.se]
22:18  ajpiano: maestrojed, check if($ === jQuery)
22:18 --- Corey sets modes [#jquery -o Corey]
22:18  Cork[home]: eTiger13: i use both these already, but in this case the table is contentEditable so i can't add extra elements
22:18  ajpiano: aw Corey ... stealing all the fun
22:18  eTiger13: ajpiano: that wont tell him where it is happening though
22:19  ajpiano: true store
22:19 * gnarf grins
22:19  Corey: ajpiano: Yeah, my interest in watching that in four channels at once was limited.
22:19  ajpiano: hehhh
22:19  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  add them and then remove them immediately
22:20  Cork[home]: eTiger13: but thats just as slow as copying the text to a hidden node
22:20  fade1: Is it possible to disable an event listener, without completely removing it? I'm assigning different click events using namespaceing. ie: $('#id').bind('click.foo', foo).bind('click.bar',bar); With unbind() I can remove each event individually with unbind(), but then later I need to know what the functions are when rebinding. I was hoping there was a way i could do something like: rebind('click.foo') after running unbind('click.foo');
22:20  Cork[home]: eTiger13: the loop needs to go through 50+ rows with around 5-10 cells per row
22:20  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  yup. too bad there isnt an is(overflowed) method. or is there?
22:20  Cork[home]: that takes serus time if you copy the content
22:21  Cork[home]: eTiger13: i would actually be ok with just a way to use scrollWidth on cells :/
22:21  sac_: fade1, when i need to do that i use some var that i check inside the event handler if it should return immediately
22:21  eTiger13: fade1:  add a on/off listener. if ( !enbld ) { return }
22:21  fade1: sac_: that's what i was going to fall back on if i couldn't find a better answer :)
22:22  Cork[home]: eTiger13: or even better a way like in c whre you can ask "how wide is this string in px" thats so nice ^^
22:22  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  but you have it set to overflow hidden which means no scroll. how about dropping the width on the cells via classes and then checking for width greater than 100 than readd the width class?
22:23  sac_: Cork[home], that would be nice to have for real in javascript but that's easy enough to emulate
22:23  maestrojed: ajpiano: I ran if($ === jQuery){ alert('bingo');} Is that what you suggested? I got an "undefined" error
22:23  Cork[home]: eTiger13: showing scrollbars doesn't matter for the scroll
22:23  eTiger13: ?scrollwidth
22:23  bot-t: eTiger13, #7542 (scrollWidth/scrollHeight function) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7542
22:23  Cork[home]: eTiger13: its just that theres an exception for a few elements that gets the width of the element instead of the content
22:23  Michael: Cork[home], Render a 'W' to a div and get the width and height
22:24  Cork[home]: (it works in ie wierdly enough)
22:24  fade1: if( typeof($)!='undefined' && $===jQuery)
22:24  Cork[home]: Michael: as different chars has different sizes that doesn't work sadly
22:24  gnarf: fade1: window.$ == window.jQuery
22:25  Michael: Cork[home], W is the widest letter though in non monospace fonts
22:25  Michael: so that will be the biggest a lettter will be
22:25  Michael: -t
22:25  Michael: should be enough to approximate in most cases
22:25  Michael: If you're doing things like font scaling based on container size
22:25  eTiger13: maestrojed: use the net tab in firebug, show only the js files and then search in those for noconflict ( case insensitive )
22:26  maestrojed: eTiger13: ok thx, will do
22:26  Cork[home]: Michael: i'm planing to add tooltips if the content is wider then the cell
22:26  Michael: right
22:26  Cork[home]: Michael: so it needs to be farly acuret
22:27  Cork[home]: *accurate
22:27  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  you didnt say that before
22:27  Michael: I wonder if you could do a trick with an A tag
22:27  Michael: a { width: 100px; overflow: hidden; } a:hover { overflow: auto; } or whatever
22:27  Cork[home]: eTiger13: i only said i needed to know if it overflow
22:27  eTiger13: Cork[home]:  then copy all of the cells to tooltips and remove the ones that are less than 100px since you have to create them anyway
22:27  Cork[home]: Michael: how would that solve it?
22:28  Cork[home]: eTiger13: the cells never becomes wider then a pre set max
22:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o Corey]
22:28  Cork[home]: and they are added dynamically
22:28  Cork[home]: (infinit scroll)
22:28  gnarf: Cork[home]: well, first of all, you will only need to know this "content wider than the cell" issue on mouseover right?
22:29  Cork[home]: gnarf: mostly ya
22:29  Cork[home]: but today i have hardcoded widths cause the check is to slow
22:29  gnarf: you could probably just detect the single cell case by setting overflow to scroll, changing scrollLeft to some obscenely high number, see if it is greater than 0 and then set it all back
22:29  Cork[home]: if posible i would want to remove that too
22:29  Michael: Are you truncating the strings and suffixing them with an ellipses?
22:30  Cork[home]: gnarf: that would make the content flicker on hover though
22:30  gnarf: Cork[home]: if its all done in the same event loop, it shouldn't
22:30  Cork[home]: hmm, worth a try!
22:30  Cork[home]: thx
22:31  gnarf: and besides
22:31  liam: I have a list of elements. I am picking up the mousedown event of an anchor (hyperlink). I want to then select the <div class="name"> which is above the hyperlink... How can I do this? here is an html example http://sspaste.com/paste/show/4d23950bb4ba1
22:31  Cork[home]: gnarf: though setting the overflow to scroll isn't needed
22:31  gnarf: if you use .data() to cache that result you wont check it twice
22:31  Cork[home]: you can scroll an element with overflow: hidden
22:31  Cork[home]: gnarf: can't as its a grid where the user can resize the columns
22:31  Cork[home]: (and edit the content)
22:32  Cork[home]: but just flicking the scrollLeft shouldn't const that much
22:33  eTiger13: ?select @ liam

22:34  developerhealey: Whats a good auto complete solutions/plugin for a drop down select list i am creating... (there are a lot of options and i want to be able to narrow down by typing... but if nothing is typed id like it to popup anyways to see all options
22:34  gnarf: liam: select the div?
22:34 --- drapetomaniac_ is now known as drapetomaniac
22:35  eTiger13: developerhealey: have you looked at jqui autocomplete?
22:35  liam: eTiger13: sorry I don't mean it like that... The problem is I have a list of the divs and I want to select the closest one (which is above this link) but I haven't been able to get it to work with "closest" or "siblings" any ideas? gnarf

22:35  bot-t: liam, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
22:36  gnarf: liam, that would be .parent().prev() -- also , a <div> can't exist as a child of a <ul>
22:36  sac_: Cork[home], i just had to try how it works, seems ok http://jsfiddle.net/sactor/FLaad/
22:36  gnarf: and a <li> can't exist without a <ul> parent
22:36  raRaRa: Hiya. Anyone here experienced with the Address plugin? It does not seem to trigger change when there's an encoded string such as la%ed a parameter.
22:36  gnarf: so, thats invalid html
22:37  gnarf: easier would be to assign an id to the div, and use the href param to actually link to the id of the div
22:37  marcamillion: what's wrong with this syntax: if(window.location.hash == 'register') { show_registration_form(); }
22:37  gnarf: marcamillion: hash includes the #
22:38  marcamillion: ahhh...
22:38  marcamillion: wow
22:38  marcamillion: thanks man
22:38  marcamillion: u were right
22:38  marcamillion: :)
22:38  maestrojed: eTiger13 gnarf ajpiano Thank you for your help. For some reason Prototype was loading. That was causing the conflict. Your ideas lead me to the issue and I appreciate it.
22:38  sean`: GAIZ
22:39  sean`: First jQuery meeting today ! at 9pm est
22:40  Michael: Kinda late for me

22:40  gnarf: sean`: meeting?
22:40  sac_: http://jsfiddle.net/sactor/FLaad/1/ updated a bit :>
22:41  sean`: gnarf, check out yeah, it awws on blog.jquery.com -- http://pastie.org/1425988
22:41  gnarf: i really should subscribe to that
22:42  gnarf: um
22:42  gnarf: WTB rss link on blog?
22:44  erichynds: sac_ why extend String.prototype there?
22:44  gnarf: http://blog.jquery.com/2010/12/30/hotlinking-to-be-disabled-on-jan-31-2011
22:44  gnarf: hrm
22:44  gnarf: 301 anyone? :)
22:44  FunnyLookinHat: If I have a bunch of form fields in a <form> - is there an easy way to serialize them together and submit via ajax with $.post ?
22:44  Ely2: I have an issue where IE adds the br in the input after the href is opened and ff, chrome, safari adds the BR immidiatly http://jsfiddle.net/HvDva/1/
22:44  ss23: wtf gnarf :/
22:45  ajpiano: gnarf, just redirecting and 301'ing uses too many connection
22:45  ss23: Why did they list the jquey site as a possible link to use for websites if they didn't want people usiung it.
22:45  gnarf: ajpiano: i knows...
22:45  Ely2: is there a ay to do this different
22:45  ajpiano: ss23, there's a sifference between using the CDN and just hotlinking to...anything else that's not the CDN
22:45  ajpiano: like people who are hotlinking to jquery ui theme css and images
22:45  Ely2: what I do is that I have a postback on that link normally and that IE adds the br after the page is loaded (the br is not added to the inpunts)
22:46  ss23: Maybe I'm missing what that was talking about. Last time I checked on the downlaod page, it listed "include this js file from jquery.com in your document header" as a way to use jQuery.
22:46  sac_: erichynds, well you could do it any way you like, i just happened to do it like that
22:46  ss23: Hmm, I thought it was talking about the http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.4.min.js Minified version ones, but if not, then I misunderstood :S
22:47  chovy: is there a way to trigger an event when an object scrolls out of view?
22:47  sac_: kinda liked the idea of 'foo'.width() although most likely if i actually used that in production i'd just make it a function where i pass the string
22:47  erichynds: ?g jquery viewport selectors @ chovy
22:47  bot-t: chovy, Viewport Selectors | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/viewport
22:48  Ely2: U could add the <br> on mouse over but how can I do this only once?
22:48  eTiger13: ss23: include the file in your page header meaning the file you download, put it on your host and include it in your pages header section. or link to one of the cdns
22:49  pender: showEly: use a 'one' event
22:49  pender: showEly: $('a').one('click', function() { alert ('Run once!'); });
22:50  sac_: erichynds, why did you ask though? is it always bad?
22:50  Ely2: ah one ok
22:50  Ely2: lets try
22:50  chovy: erichynds: thanks
22:50  erichynds: sac_ generally yeah.. bad practice at least
22:50  ocf: 'llo all. Its my personal opinion that "repeating animations", or using jquery to replicate a never-ending animated gif, is shitty. Is this just me, or is there an article I can point my client to proving that I'm not a moron?
22:51  Ely2: thank you pender :)
22:51  pender: ocf: No. Having a valid point only undermines your case :)
22:51  ocf: lol pender :)
22:52  pender: ocf: What you need is an even worse idea (the more intrusive the better) that'll shift focus away from that other bad idea.
22:52  sac_: :D
22:52  Cork[home]: gnarf: gah.. its not only scrollWidth that dodesn't work on a table cell, neither does scrollLeft OR overflow: scroll/auto :s
22:52  Cork[home]: oh well it was a nice idea
22:53  ocf: well I just don't want to do it, and I'd love to have some evidence as to why
22:54  gnarf: Cork[home]: you can still copy the text to the tooltip using the same font-size / check its width before displaying right?
22:54  ocf: it just looks shitty, it needlessly uses resources, and it makes me feel like I'm playing with 1995
22:54  pender: ocf: lie. tell them you can't.
22:54  Cork[home]: gnarf: thats not the problem, its the selective ness that gives me headace
22:54  pender: ocf: or... double the cost of the work, feel worse about yourself, but better about your bank account!
22:55  ocf: lol
22:55  gnarf: Cork[home]: why be selective? copy the text no matter what, check the width before .show()
22:55  sac_: pender, it seems you are very experienced :)
22:55  ocf: okay then I guess i'll just do it :)
22:55 * pender lolz
22:55  pender: I'm working on Toyota's website... They have a "RESTful image service"
22:55  gnarf: ocf: animation replicating a gif?
22:55  Cork[home]: gnarf: title="" :)
22:56  ocf: gnarf - there used to be an animated gift that repeated every like 10 seconds
22:56  ocf: it was choppy and ugly and horrendous to behold (slight exaggeration)
22:56  pender: Getting 1 image takes 4 requests: 1 to the site, 1 to the service, 1 to amazon, and 1 more for the site
22:56 * pender cries himself to sleep everynight.... on a pile of dirty, dirty money.
22:57  ocf: I've replaced the functionality with animating via jQuery, and I'd like to avoid hacking in an animation loop
22:57  sac_: pender, that's kinda dailywtf worthy :>
22:57  pender: ocf: why not just throw in a flash animation?
22:57  ocf: a) I don't code in flash
22:57  ocf: b) its so simple
22:58  pender: ocf: good reasons :)
22:58  ocf: its animating the left of an image about 800 pixels, fading in and out text around it
22:58  gnarf: ocf: function myAnimate() { $elem.animate()....animate({}, 10000, myAnimate) }
22:58  gnarf: whats so hard about that?
22:59  ocf: nothing, I just think animated reanimations are retarded
22:59  gnarf: ocf: id agree, but if the client wants it and doesn't want to listen to your "it makes you look retarted" argument
22:59  pender: lol!
23:00  gnarf: i think most animations are retarded in the first place
23:00  seutje: $.fn.cpr \o/
23:00  pender: gnarf: what did you watch growing up?
23:00  ocf: well their site is covered in cartoony font... I should say.. images with cartoony font, so google sees "<html><body></body></html>"
23:00  ocf: so they already look retarded
23:00  ocf: so yeah, why not
23:00  gnarf: pender: in the context of websites
23:01  raRaRa: Is it possible to check if url changes with jQuery, I'm adding different values after the hash
23:01  gnarf: ocf: just don't sign your work or put it on your portfolio
23:01  gnarf: :)
23:01  sac_: ocf, if there's any text on the site, recommend comic sans for them, they'll probably love you
23:01  ocf: I already have
23:02  gnarf: http://www.designlessbetter.com/blogless/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/340x_no_comic_sans_please.jpg
23:02  ocf: definitely recommended @font-face concept
23:02  sac_: i was joking :(
23:02  Pharaoh: gr struggling to make a simple long polling
23:02  Pharaoh: so confusing
23:02  ocf: well, they REFUSE to go away from the cartoon font
23:02  ocf: so I at least offered to give them text instead of images everywhere
23:02  sac_: lol
23:02  sac_: sounds like serious business
23:02 --- flipzagging_ is now known as flipzagging
23:02  ocf: they also are using .NET
23:03  ocf: which is a big enough violation
23:03  ocf: but when I started this project, they had 8 pages in .net, and 93 as .htm
23:03  ocf: so they were selectively abusing an abusive language
23:03  Pharaoh: how do you guys learn all this stuff
23:03 * ocf weeps softly every night... on a pile of dirty, dirty sheets. No money.
23:04  semaphore: i used to do .net; now i don't hate my life.
23:04  sean`: lol ocf
23:04  pender: ocf: you just need to lower your standards, loose the dignity, abuse your conscience and just generally enjoy inflicting misery to people using the internet. simple.
23:05  ian-work: the keys to freelancing dollars

23:05  gnarf: Pharaoh: most of us probably
23:05  ian-work: from 6pm-2am Pharaoh
23:05  ocf: which is why I'm poor
23:05 * x3rames is too
23:05 * ocf is freelancor as well
23:05  Pharaoh: well im looking for 2 particular things one semi small one quite large
23:06 * ocf is freelancer, actually
23:06 * ocf is not a certified spell checker
23:06  x3rames: ocf: whats your problem with building a marijuana empire? ò.o
23:06  pender: x3rames: you get -18 coding points :)
23:06 * gnarf takes ocf's statement and decides its time to roll a joint
23:06  ocf: well I do live in Oregon, so I probably would have a good jumpstart

23:07  ocf: inline-block fails IE, no?
23:07  Pharaoh: never heard of it gnarf ill go look but i bet i cant set it up properly
23:07  gnarf: only on elements that aren't block to begin with
23:08  Cork[home]: no problem, ie works with scrollWidth on td
23:08 * pender wonders what bugs Internet Explorer 15 will have... Bugs of the future! 
23:08  ocf: oh, perfect
23:08  ocf: IE15 might even have a CSS4 selector in it
23:08  gnarf: ocf: nah - you'll have to shiv it
23:09  Cork[home]: gnarf: thx for the idea, i wouldn't ever have thought of that idea
23:09  gnarf: Cork[home]: np - sometimes the obvious approach is hidden behind the elephant in the room
23:09  Cork[home]: :D
23:10  gnarf: Cork[home]: that experience / result is prolly worthy of a blog post
23:10  Pharaoh: can you point me to their homepage gnarf im getting blogs when i search it =/
23:13  raRaRa: No ideas how to check if the address changed? :)
23:13  Pharaoh: hmm not sure campfire is what im looking for cant integrate it to my server
23:13  James13433: Can I animate the backgroundColor to "none" or does it have to be a color?
23:14  frvge: I was going to build a new web app with extjs, but now I see that it's not free for commercial use. Any tips for a jQuery based modular thing? Something with Backbone.js for example? I want to use MVC.
23:14  Cork[home]: James13433: transparent
23:14  James13433: Thanks Cork
23:14  Cork[home]: np
23:15  gnarf: not sure you can animate to transparent
23:15  Cork[home]: James13433: none isn't a valid value for background color
23:15  Cork[home]: you can but it will go to black then be transparent
23:15  Cork[home]: as it doesn't support alpha animation
23:15  gnarf: but you could animate to .parent().css('background-color') then assign transparent
23:15  gnarf: maybe?
23:16  sean`: frvge, http://addyosmani.com/blog/large-scale-jquery/ might be something for yuo
23:16  Cork[home]: i think theres a plugin that implement rgba animation though
23:16  frvge: Yes, that's why I asked. Basically just popped my mind when I saw that URL.
23:16  pender: Be careful! You can't animate 24-bit transparent PNGs in IE.
23:16  draginx: How do I animate into a css class?
23:16  frvge: Ohh, didnt scroll down enough xD
23:18  Cork[home]: draginx: jquery-ui supports that
23:18  draginx: Cork: but how?
23:19  draginx: Trying to look at the documentation doesnt say :(
23:19  Cork[home]: addClass
23:19  draginx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
23:19  draginx: mmm
23:19  draginx: $("selector").animate({addClass: "hello"}) ?
23:19  Cork[home]: no one sec
23:20  developerhealey: The Jquery UI Autocomplete Combobox is SLOWWWW
23:20  James13433: Cork[home] just went white not transparent...
23:20  Cork[home]: draginx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/addClass/
23:20  chovy: ericbarnes: is there a plugin that works with divs instead of windows?
23:20  Cork[home]: James13433: check my convo with gnarf, and you see why
23:21  Cork[home]: James13433: http://pioupioum.fr/sandbox/jquery-color/
23:22  Cork[home]: if you want transparanse animation you need alpha, aka rgba
23:24  draginx: ok what im trying to make is a smooth scroll of text coming through http://cripplewars.com/text/?msg= just type "test" into the box and click it 4 times
23:24  draginx: as u can see its not very smooth :(
23:26  pender: draginx: Your mark-up and CSS could be a lot more efficient. You're controlling the animation via the document flow, and also animating relative to that flow...
23:26  draginx: pender: As u can tell I am 110% lost
23:27  pender: draginx: Set all those <span>'s to position absolute, then animate their position by hand.
23:28  draginx: pender: by hand? cant if the site is dynamic...
23:28  pender: draginx: Or forget all the top/left animations and just animate the height.
23:28  draginx: set height to 0?
23:28  developerhealey: JQuery UI Autocomplete itself is really slow for what it does
23:28 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
23:28  Cork[home]: draginx: as far as i can see your not giveing the fadein a duration
23:29  pender: draginx: When you hide 1 of the span, you end up animating 1) The height of that span and 2) It's top position and 3) all the subsequent elements
23:29  Cork[home]: try something like fadeIn('fast') or something
23:29  EpiphanyG: hey everyone
23:30  pender: draginx: There's too much going on... When you 'hide' the first element, at each step of hte animation it's recalculating all the subsequent divs, because they're positioned relative to the one that's disappearing. So a 1px height animation changes several other animations, which triggers more, etc.
23:30  draginx: hmm
23:30  pender: s/div/span/
23:30 * gnarf grumbles about software making huge changes to its database structure
23:30  draginx: i just want it to limit to the first one..
23:31  EpiphanyG: does anyone know any jQuery plugins written using the "Object Literal pattern" that rebecca murphey mentions here - http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code ?
23:31  pender: draginx: So either do a showHide() on the first span and work from there, or handle all the animations by hand (i.e., you write a algorithm to handle the top/left/opacity of the animations)
23:31  Pharaoh: any one know a good forum to look for freelancers?
23:32  draginx: http://cripplewars.com/text/?msg= ok got it a bi smoother :)
23:33  James13433: Cork[home] cheers for the link, got this error thouhg, in the jquery.color.js file http://jquery.pastebin.com/gh4WDJQR
23:33  pender: EpiphanyG: jquery tools uses it a bit
23:34  EpiphanyG: cool, I'll take a look, thanks! I'm just trying to get my head around how to extend it, because I'm already using an extend once, in the init function
23:36  pender: EpiphanyG: You're out on your own there... Though there's a few posts about writing an object extender in JavaScript.
23:36  Pharaoh: what are u trying to make on cripple wars
23:36  Pharaoh: a chat room?
23:37  EpiphanyG: thanks for the poke in the right direction though, pender :)
23:37  pender: EpiphanyG: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/ --- There's a bit of a turf war goign on in the comments between jQuery/Prototype/base guys but there's a decent explanation of class-based extension, which dove tails into the object literal stuff when you're doing class-bsed inheritance
23:37  EpiphanyG: ooh nice, thanks :)
23:37  mekwall: EpiphanyG: all jquery ui widgets uses object literal pattern :)
23:38 --- Cain` is now known as Cain
23:38  EpiphanyG: mekwall - thanks, looking now
23:39  EpiphanyG: I've never made a plugin before, or even looked at how to, but decided I should turn something I've already written into a plugin... Not as straight forward as I expected :D
23:42 --- Back2Basics_ is now known as Back2Basics
23:44  EpiphanyG: cool, looks like I have a lot to learn, thanks for the info though pender + mekwall :)
23:44  pdxmike: EpiphanyG - what sorts of curve balls are you getting, tring to plugin-ize your code?
23:45  mekwall: EpiphanyG: I have a small plugin patttern that I made: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/jRxHP/
23:46  EpiphanyG: pdxmike: well, not sure yet, just trying to get my head around the basics. I'm just trying to see how I should be using extend as I already use it once, without also extending the user's custom config
23:46  mekwall: EpiphanyG: also, you can look at my jQuery UI Select widget: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/D7mgg/
23:46  BinaryKitten: anyone have a log for a couple of days ago.. i made a small plugin for someone i think called kgx. I lost hte bookmark
23:46  chovy: does $(document).ready() get triggered whenever the dom is updated?
23:46  ss23: BinaryKitten: Let me search for you
23:47  pender: chovy: no
23:47  ss23: BinaryKitten: Only reference to "kgx" I see is just now, sorry
23:47  ss23: Might'vebeen before I joined
23:47  pender: Man
23:47  EpiphanyG: mekwall, thanks for those :)
23:47  pender: I wish they had these awesome bots when I used IRC regularly.
23:47  BinaryKitten: name might be wrong.. but it was an placeholder type plugin
23:47  chovy: pender: something appears to be firing it twice.
23:48  mekwall: EpiphanyG: np :) will probably be some kinks and quirks about, but hopefully you'll find them useful
23:48  pender: chovy: $(document).ready(function() { alert('hi'); }); on it's own alerts twice?
23:50  EpiphanyG: so it doesn't all have to fit into the $.fn.whatever { } closure?
23:50  RobW: .abortion
23:50  RobW: ?abortion
23:50  bot-t: function abortion() { $(document).children().die(); }
23:50  RobW: it still lives on.
23:51  pender: chovy: Are you doing anything on the entire body of the document? like $('body').html() stuff?
23:51  RobW: or even the wildcard asterisk
23:52  EpiphanyG: sweet, that geoNames script is really useful, cheers mekwall :)
23:52  mekwall: EpiphanyG: hehe np :)
23:53  EpiphanyG: do fiddles stay up for long? or will I need to back this up?
23:53  mekwall: so far, there's no lifetime :)
23:53  mekwall: so it will stay up until jsfiddles db crashes
23:53  EpiphanyG: lovely :D
23:53  mekwall: but I guess they have backups ;)
23:53  EpiphanyG: :)
23:53  draginx: Is there a way to select all elements except the last?
23:54  mekwall: EpiphanyG: http://jsfiddle.net/user/mekwall/fiddles/

23:54  bot-t: draginx, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
23:54  draginx: would rather not slice
23:54  draginx: just trying to remove
23:54  mekwall: draginx: sure.. $('*').not(':last');
23:54  draginx: not slice, then each, then remove
23:54  EpiphanyG: nice mekwall, will bookmark it :)
23:55  mekwall: draginx: or just $('*:not(:last)');
23:55  Back2Basics_: has anyone tried to merge the form wizard pluggin nav buttons with a modal dialog box from jquery ui?
