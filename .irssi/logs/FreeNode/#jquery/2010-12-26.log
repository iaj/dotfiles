21:35  eponym: Seriously though, emacs.
21:35  sonotos: eponym: hm curl is afaik for asynchrone http requests, don't think you will have a chance to connect an irc server with that

21:40  snover: AssangeKiller: please don’t stray too far off-topic :)
21:40  AssangeKiller: i am sorry. It is not happen again.
21:42  krz: shouldnt jQuery.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: function (xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/javascript")} }) be enforced in all ajax methods?
21:42  sean`: no, it sets a default
21:43  krz: hm
21:44  krz: sean`: so if i have the following: http://pastebin.com/itPv0tXB Does the code in the paste bin override the default?
21:45  krz: sean`: or it shouldn't?
21:45  sean`: what don't you get about it
21:45  sean`: it's the default
21:45  sean`: a defualt can be told to piss off
21:46  sean`: so yes, this code won't run your ajaxSetu :)
21:46  krz: damn. ok thanks

21:51  islands: hi #jquery
21:52  islands: im developing a jquery plugin that has click handlers.. when i use the plugin on a naked page, it works fine
21:52  islands: however when i insert it into, for example, my movabletype blog, the click handlers dont respond to click events
21:52  islands: im attaching click events to an html5 <canvas> element
21:53  islands: could someone give some insight on how to debug this sort of problem? i have chrome and ff+fb
21:53  EpiphanyG: are they items that are created after page load?
21:53  islands: yes
21:53  islands: the entire plugin is activated after load
21:53  EpiphanyG: maybe you need to use live instead of click
21:54 --- spliff is now known as drubies_
21:54  islands: sorry, my bad, i am using mousedown, mousemove etc
21:54  islands: ah, ok, i will try $.live
21:55  EpiphanyG: maybe try .live('mousedown,mousemove',function({}))
21:55  EpiphanyG: ok yeah :)
21:56  eponym: that's a good suggestion. I'm not an expert on the tools for debugging these sorts of things, but I might try setting up some breakpoints and inspecting the element after you think you've bound the click handler and then inspecting the element to see if that is going right. I think you can do that.
21:57  eponym: and congratulations on a question well asked. i was about to ask whether anyone else was noticing a correlation between their irritability level and questions from the esl crowd.
21:57 --- WebDragon is now known as WebDragon|away
21:58  islands: thanks
21:58  islands: indeed, interpreting questions on irc is sometimes an effort in futility
21:59  eponym: i'm superstitious that the more irritable i get, the worse the questions tend to be.
21:59  EpiphanyG: :)
21:59  EpiphanyG: I think both probably effect each other :)
22:00  islands: EpiphanyG: ok, i switched them to to live, and same behavior (Works naked, doesn't work in site)
22:00  EpiphanyG: doh :D
22:00  islands: eponym: ok lets see if i can set up some breakpoints to see what happens after the supposed binding
22:01  EpiphanyG: I'd suggest you take eponym's advice then, and try setting some breakpoints
22:01  EpiphanyG: I type too slow :)
22:01  islands: u slowpoke :)
22:01  EpiphanyG: :D
22:02  islands: i might be doing something inherently wrong in my plugin
22:02  islands: in a nutshell, the bind events occur within this block in my included plugin: (function($){ $.fn.islandsChart = function(optionsIn) { //mouse handlers here
22:02  eponym: oh god. my roommate is talking loudly about her yeast infection on the phone. i am not going to get *anything* done this afternoon with this in my head.
22:03  sean`: talk about a prude
22:03  EpiphanyG: now it's in my head too :P
22:03  EpiphanyG: very abstract
22:05  islands: hi prgmrBill
22:07  EpiphanyG: bye everyone :)
22:07  islands: laters
22:15  BrixSat: is there any way to treat ajax xml response in jquery?
22:16  sean`: treat it how
22:18  BrixSat: i have this xml http://radiocaxinas.com:8000/status2.xsl and i want to get a specific tag
22:18  BrixSat: in this case titulo
22:24  Drule: p
22:24  Drule: p
22:24  Drule: afqwpoihfp
22:24  Drule: god damn hotkeys
22:24  coldhead: sweet typing bro
22:25  islands: BrixSat: maybe u need something like jParse http://jparse.kylerush.net/ http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+xml+parser
22:27  islands: eponym: im doing some research and maybe FireQuery will be helpful, as it allows me to see which jQuery events are attached to which DOM elements
22:27  eponym: islands: that's good to know about.
22:28  eponym: I need to get better with events, right now I'm sort of clutzy with them.
22:28  islands: im kind of clutzy in general :)

22:49  Bartzy: When doing $('#bla').accordion(...)
22:49  Bartzy: and in some pages #bla doesn't exist.. it doesn't matter right ?
22:51  Bartzy: Meaning I don't need to check for #bla existence, because if it doesn't exist it will just return 0 jquery objects in this selector, and then the plugin won't initiate ?

22:59  islands: mykstor: ka() line 22 is jquery?"
22:59  islands: or your code?
22:59  mykstor: jquery
23:00  mykstor: works fine on Safari
23:00  mykstor: is this a conflict with Firebug?
23:00  snover: mykstor: first of all, do not use minified jquery when developing.
23:00  islands: which version of firebug
23:01  mykstor: 1.5.4 I believe
23:01  mykstor: I should use full version then switch when it works?

23:09  dabear: Vincent1800: hi'
23:09  mykstor: I think my firebug must conflict with it or something?

23:10  dabear: nor the regular one
23:10  mykstor: No I don't think so... not a plugin

23:16  Bartzy: and in some pages #bla doesn't exist.. it doesn't matter right ?
23:16  BrixSat1: dabear:  no site is up
23:17  dabear: Bartzy: accordions would not apply for any elements in that case

23:17  Bartzy: dabear: and #bla doesn't exist... the variable bla will be null ?
23:17  Bartzy: or false ?
23:17  dabear: so www does not work

23:20  temp01: no dabear
23:20  dabear: e.g. some function with wrong parameters
23:20  temp01: there must be a bug in jquery.. see the error is in jquery.min.js
23:20  dabear: temp01: yep, and that can[has happened to me] when I fcked up
23:21  dabear: mykstor: use the non minified version of jquery

23:21  ajpiano: BrixSat1, .innerHTML is not a jQuery method, use jQuery("#nomemusica").html(titulo);
23:22  BrixSat1: ajpiano:  :D
23:22  ajpiano: kippi: datatables...or slickgrid, definitely NOT tablesorter
23:22  mykstor: http://bayimg.com/BaBlHAAdn mykstor1
23:22  Bartzy: Can I toggle between 2 text values ?
23:22  temp01: ?screenshot @ mykstor
23:22  bot-t: mykstor, A screenshot is the lowest form of documentation. A code sample, a live demo, or even a better explanation are usually better than a screenshot.
23:22  Bartzy: I have a span.. I want that on click, the span text will change to 'b' if it was 'a', and vice-versa.
23:22  temp01: ?toggle(fn) @ Bartzy
23:22  bot-t: Bartzy, .toggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle2
23:22  kippi: ajpiano: either datatables or slickgrid as good as each other?
23:23  ajpiano: i don't know much about datatables from a perf standpoint
23:23  ajpiano: just mentioneing that you should research slickgrid
23:23  BrixSat1: ajpiano:  sttill not working :(
23:23  mykstor: http://bayimg.com/cAbLMAADn mykstor2
23:23  rmurphey: ohai ajpiano
23:23  Bartzy: temp01: I don't want to hide and show.. I want to toggle the text itself
23:24  ajpiano: hey rmurphey
23:24  temp01: mykstor: i'll fricking kill you
23:24  ajpiano: mykstor, you aren't really helping anyone with these screenshots, you need to paste *your jQuery code*
23:24  Bartzy: When the span says : close and the user clicks, I need it to change to 'read more' , and when it says 'read more' and the user clicks, I need it to say 'close'....
23:24  mykstor: bot-t thanks... let me try.
23:24  ajpiano: Bartzy, use .text(function() { });
23:24  temp01: Bartzy: oh yeah

23:24  ajpiano: ?text(function @ Bartzy

23:25  Bartzy: so text or toggle ? ;p
23:25  temp01: use text with function
23:25  temp01: forget toggle
23:25  Bartzy: why ?
23:26  temp01: ok, use toggle with text()
23:26  mykstor: u() ka() jQuery.1.4.4min.js()  now I'll post line 22 which is highlighted as "bad"
23:26  ajpiano: mykstor
23:26  rmurphey: mykstor: can you show us the actual html of the page that is having the issue?

23:27  Bartzy: yeah, thanks.
23:28  ajpiano: mykstor, not screenshots of minified jquery
23:28  rmurphey: mykstor: please, can you post a link to the ACTUAL page that you are having issues with?
23:28  temp01: mykstor: start by using the full version of jquery. that'll show you helpful errors and point you to useful line numbers
23:28  ajpiano: i don't have a problem, you are just not faciliating yourself getting help.  someone has to tell you that.
23:28  rmurphey: or at least paste the html somewhere or something?
23:28  mykstor: sure.  http://michaelstorer.com/ATEST.html
23:29  Bartzy: ajpiano: You're very pragmatic :)
23:29  rmurphey: mykstor: that is the entirety of the page?
23:29  rmurphey: i do not see an error
23:29  mykstor: it works fine unless you try it with firefox 3.6.13. mac
23:29  mykstor: it is a test page.. the bare minimum to show the problm
23:30  rmurphey: mykstor: i understand what a test page is, i was trying to verify that, indeed, just this html is causing you an error
23:30  mykstor: this page wont load for me on firefox... i get this entire error message bs on firebug
23:30  rmurphey: i have ff 3.6.12
23:30  rmurphey: and it loads without an error
23:30  ajpiano: what if you disable firebug, mykstor
23:30  rmurphey: (mac)
23:31  mykstor: yes, even just this page without even USING the jquery link
23:31 * rmurphey updates to 3.6.13
23:31  rmurphey: ok, i have gone to http://michaelstorer.com/ATEST.html
23:31  rmurphey: in firefox 3.6.13 mac
23:31  rmurphey: and i do not get any console error and the page loads fine
23:32  mykstor: well, i should disaable firebug next, but don't know how.
23:32  rmurphey: (in that it says ABCDEFG on it)
23:32  mykstor: also, would be best if it would work for people who HAVE firebug
23:32  rmurphey: i have firebug
23:32  rmurphey: 1.5.4
23:32  ajpiano: mykstor, do you have any other weird extensions installed?  have you tried upgrading to fb 1.6.0
23:33  coldhead: lol facebook
23:33  mykstor: no.... is 1.6.0 stable now... thought it was beta.?
23:34  mykstor: other weird extensions... don't think so.. this is mysterious.
23:34  ajpiano: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843/ looks stable to me
23:34  mykstor: ok... will install but may have to restart.
23:35  mykstor: no more ideas, guys?
23:35  rmurphey: works fine for me with fb 1.6.0 as well
23:35  mykstor: where else could I ask?
23:35  Bartzy: $('.accordion_header').click(function() { $(this).next().slideToggle('slow'); return false; }).next().hide();
23:35  rmurphey: mykstor: it's not that we don't have ideas, it's that at least i can't even replicate the issue
23:35  Bartzy: This works, but I don't understand why the .next().hide() is needed at the end ?
23:35  rmurphey: you could try, like someone said, using an unminified version of jquery
23:35  Bartzy: for accordion with multiple sections
23:35  mykstor: so I have some bug in my own firefox or firebug maybe...
23:35  Bartzy: multiple sections open*
23:35  rmurphey: and then you will get better debug/line # info
23:36  rmurphey: debugging against the minified verson is going to give you fairly useless errors
23:36  mykstor: oh, so THAT's the advantage! I'm new to jquery... but I love it...
23:37  rmurphey: ?
23:37  rmurphey: the advantage of what?
23:37  rmurphey: the advantage of unminified jquery?
23:37  mykstor: of full vs mini
23:37  rmurphey: yes, the unminified you can actually .. read

23:41  nvictor: hi
23:41  BrixSat1: http://pastebin.com/FWf4ZHw3 why does the function success is not called?
23:42  nvictor: is a loading message div supposed to have a "loading" class?
23:42  nvictor: or can i use something else?
23:42  ajpiano: BrixSat1, your (this) might have changed in the ajax callback, see ?ajaxcallbackscope
23:42  bot-t: BrixSat1, How to deal with scope in Ajax callbacks. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/calling-object-inside-of-jquery-function#14737000000758879 Before: http://jsbin.com/iliga3/edit After: http://jsbin.com/iliga3/2/edit
23:43  ajpiano: oh nm,
23:43  ajpiano: i misread
23:44  nvictor: http://pastebin.com/3X5V6Tms
23:44  nvictor: this is not appending anything the the body element
23:45  ajpiano: appendTo("body") or appendTo(document.body)
23:45  nvictor: ajpiano: oh ok thanks
23:45  dabear: unless body is a variable containing "body" :p
23:46  BrixSat1: ajpiano:  this is a little bit more complicated than it seems
23:47  Bartzy: ajpiano: following the text toggle thingie.. I also need that when clicking on something, among other stuff it will animate to 500px width if the current width is 300px, and vice-versa...
23:47  Bartzy: can it be done with toggle ? :|
23:47  ajpiano: it can be done with toggle, it can be done with a single click handler with an if statement
23:47  ajpiano: you just have to think about it ;)
23:49  Bartzy: ajpiano : So just check the width now, and animate accordingly ?
23:49  Bartzy: Just thought maybe there's some smart function for it
23:49  ajpiano: you can use toggle
23:49  ajpiano: and alternate the functoins on click
23:50  Bartzy: how do I alternate the functions on click ?
23:50  ajpiano: that is what toggle does bro
23:50  ajpiano: ?toggle(fn,fn)
23:50  bot-t: ajpiano, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
23:50  Bartzy: and toggle is also instead of the click bind itself ?
23:50  Bartzy: oh
23:50  Bartzy: so that doesn't fit for me, I need to do other stuff on click...
23:50  Bartzy: which don't need to alternate on clicks.. so I'll just use 'if's
23:50  Bartzy: thanks :]
