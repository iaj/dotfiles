08:37  trave: so, I am trying to determine if the mouse button is down when a .mouseover() event is triggered... when I console.log the event.button, its always returning 0.
08:48  dotnetted: How can I programmatically start dragging a jQueryUI draggable()? At the moment I have: <a onmousedown="function(e) { $('#foo').draggable(); $('#foo').trigger('mousedown.draggable', [e]);}"> which does not work to start dragging while the mouse is still down. Thanks.
08:53  SethX: hai all
08:53  SethX: is anybody else experiencing wierd issues with jquery 1.4.2 from google cdn?
08:54  vladikoff: SethX, like what
08:55  SethX: like TypeError: a is null
08:55  SethX: [Break on this error] a)return d;return-1},merge:function(a,...="string"){d=a;a=d[b];b=w}else if(b&&\n
08:56  dotnetted: Well after 2+ hrs of futile googling: $('#foo').draggable().data('draggable')._mouseDown(e); will work ;/
09:03  rimantas: trave, I guess button info is only available for events actually associated with a button, so you'd have to track mousedown fro this
09:03  rimantas: s/fro/for
09:04  trave: so, do I need to bind a .mouseup event to BODY, or how would i listen for mouse ups outside of a widget/
09:04  SethX: trave: to document
09:05  SethX: jquery also has a "connect to events on all nodes"
09:05  SethX: cant remember the exact name of it
09:05  trave: if I did bind $(document).mouseup(function(e) { ... });  would it still perform other previously bound mouseup events, say I start making other widgets that need the same behavior?
09:06  SethX: well if you bind multiple event handlers to document it will catch all mouseups, or all events
09:06  SethX: not sure if thats what youre asking though
09:06  SethX: anyhow you can check the e.target and see if its your widget's node
09:08  trave: so $(document).mouseup(myfunc);  would "append" myfunc as an event handler, not "replace" a singleton?

09:12  LearnerJq: i have a question ,please see this code...it is infact JQuery UI Dialogue code for which i have taken from the JQuery UI 1.7 book, http://pastebin.com/XrDDCP6F ....I want to know why is the last block of code where the filename variable is being determined used in the last of the code?because the function is called before the code starting with $("#thumbs").find("a")
09:15  LearnerJq: can a function use variables if they havent been yet calculateD?like in this code?
09:37  JenniferB2: Hi, is there a way to get the function name in all browsers ? function abc () {}; abc.name == true; // works in FF but doesn't seem to be working in IE
09:37  JenniferB2: sorry.. it should abc.name == 'abc' // true
09:38  Lumpio-: Just out of curiosity, what do you need the name for?
09:39  peeps[lappy]: man, i feel dumb, i just spent this time writing a plugin for double buffering canvases, which is totally pointless since I just realized canvas only updates after script is done executing.
09:40  peeps[lappy]: for some reason i just assumed it was an issue :-(
09:41  JenniferB2: Lumpio-: I need it in order to be able to share or make functions public by doing something like makePublic(this, func1, func2)...
09:42  Lumpio-: ok
09:43  peeps[lappy]: function properties are already public in j
09:43  JenniferB2: passing a string would force me to have the makePublic function inside the javascript class itself, and I would have to possibly use eval
09:43  peeps[lappy]: js
09:45  peeps[lappy]: by makePublic, you mean place them in the global namespace?
09:45  JenniferB2: function func() { var t1 = this; this.abc = abc; function abc() { alert(1); } } // abc without the this.abc = abc; wouldn't be public
09:45  JenniferB2: new func().abc()
09:45  JenniferB2: will now alert 1
09:47  peeps[lappy]: JenniferB2, and how would your makePublic function outside of the class ever get access to abc?
09:48 --- sora_h_ is now known as sora_h
09:48  JenniferB2: by dooing inside func() { Globals.makePublic(this, abc) } .. makePublic: http://pastebin.com/VAB2TU2S
09:49  JenniferB2: sorry.. the O.a() is a debbuger I forgot to remove
09:49  JenniferB2: the problem is that IE doesnt support the .name
09:50  carpet_the_walls: I have been using prototype with my rails app, and am thinking of migrating to jquery. Anyone with experience of both know how easy it will be? This is the kind of stuff i will have to switch https://gist.github.com/4b5d56b2b30dc333fe3f thanks
09:50  JenniferB2: chrome, safari, firefox does
09:50  myNewbie: hello need help again.
09:50  BEEPBEEP_: carpet_the_walls, very easy.
09:50  myNewbie: my scenario is http://jsfiddle.net/MqsLR/11/
09:50  danheberden: carpet_the_walls: it's gonna require going through all the code, but it wouldn't be hard
09:51  danheberden: just boring and tedious
09:51  danheberden: and you could improve things if you wanted
09:51  myNewbie: i want to use .show() and hide() on input based on select option
09:51  myNewbie: but it drive to fail.
09:51  myNewbie: pls your suggestion.
09:51  carpet_the_walls: BEEPBEEP_: danheberden: ok thanks, i think ill take the plunge
09:52  danheberden: carpet_the_walls: you'll be happy you did
09:53  carpet_the_walls: danheberden: :-)
09:53  myNewbie: hey guys...pls your assistance ----> http://jsfiddle.net/MqsLR/11/
09:54  myNewbie: i want to use .show() and hide() on input based on select option, but it wont show() or hide() either
09:54  myNewbie: whats the problem here...
09:55  peeps[lappy]: JenniferB2, only thing i can think is to just set .name property on your functions manually
09:58  JenniferB2: yeah.. not so sexy.. I could either copy paste a function to inside every class and pass strings and use eval, or possibly implement the function in one place and somehow attach it on demand to the class I need to use it.. inorder to get rid of the copy and paste stuff
09:58  BEEPBEEP_: myNewbie, use console.log in the different parts of your code to see step by step what goes wrong
10:01  BEEPBEEP_: myNewbie, something like this : http://codepad.org/GdYYfW78 to step by step debug and see where it goes wrong
10:01 --- frigginWork is now known as seutje
10:01  myNewbie: ok let me check
10:02  BEEPBEEP_: also
10:02  BEEPBEEP_: instead of using .val()
10:02  BEEPBEEP_: try using .text()
10:03  peeps[lappy]: JenniferB2, use abc.toString, and parse the name out of that
10:06  myNewbie: i'm not familiar with console javascript..
10:07  kalusn: how can i manipulate a clicked element's sibling?
10:07  sean`: kalusn, traverse to it
10:07  sean`: ?sibling @ kalusn
10:07  bot-t: kalusn, .siblings() - Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
10:07  kalusn: i read about the siblings method
10:08  sean`: .click (function () { var $this = $(this); $this.siblings ().dance ('bitches'); });
10:08  kalusn: uhh
10:08  sean`: You also have next, prev, nextUntill, prevUntill, nextAll, prevAll
10:08  kalusn: that was what i was looking for... $this.. i tried to do it with just "this"
10:08  sean`: yueah man!
10:08  sean`: BEEPBEEP_,
10:09  myNewbie: @ BEEPBEEP_ : can i use console with jsfiddle.net? or should compare with Firebug?
10:10  myNewbie: i use val() insteadof text() for purpose comparing by option value
10:16  JenniferB2: peeps[lappy]: yes.. that might work!
10:16  sean`: myNewbie, it's javascript, use your common sense
10:16  sean`: myNewbie, If you have a console, why wouldn't you be able to use it.. and furthermore.. see ?tias
10:16  bot-t: myNewbie, Try It And See
10:16  BEEPBEEP_: sean`, yes? :p
10:16  sean`: BEEEPBEEP
10:16  sean`: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
10:16  BEEPBEEP_: l)
10:16  BEEPBEEP_: honkhonk
10:16  sean`: tatas
10:16  sean`: taaataas*
10:16  BEEPBEEP_: myNewbie, be sure to remove the console.logs after the testing, shit will crash in some browsers.
10:17  BEEPBEEP_: also did you try .text() instead of .val() ?
10:18  BEEPBEEP_: o, nevermind
10:18  BEEPBEEP_: didn't rly pay attention to your markup
10:18  pixeltarian: is it possible to track an element in the viewport, in its entirety?
10:18  pixeltarian: as in, not just where the "id="thingamabob" resides
10:20  pixeltarian: but to know when the element (let's call it an entire object for our purposes) I mean, object is above or below the middle point of the window?
10:20  peeps[lappy]: i made a page where you can create a scrolling background image thingy.  what do you think:  http://alerttheinternet.com/scroller/
10:20  myNewbie: @ sean' and bot-T ...already capture with firebug.
10:21  peeps[lappy]: when you submit, it changes sets the url so that you can copy it and paste it to show others
10:21  BEEPBEEP_: peeps[lappy], I think it causes panic attacks.

10:24  peeps[lappy]: well, it's past my bedtime
10:24  pixeltarian: or let me ask it this way
10:25  pixeltarian: you can you track the position of the end of an element with jquery?
10:25  pixeltarian: can I track where </div> is?
10:25  pixeltarian: (window position, that is)
10:25  badsyntax: u can use width() with offset() or position()
10:27 --- bnb_dev_ is now known as bnb_dev
10:38  myNewbie: i made as follow : http://jsfiddle.net/MqsLR/15/
10:38  pixeltarian: are you sure that tracks the end of the element
10:38  myNewbie: nothing display on console(firebug)
10:38  pixeltarian: last time I was in here no one seemed to know how to find the end of en element
10:38  pixeltarian: an*
10:38  myNewbie: BEEPBEEP_ *Ping
10:38  twsowerby: hey guys, little bit new to both jquery and IRC. Can I get a little help?
10:38  pixeltarian: we could only figure out how to interact with where the selector resides
10:39  myNewbie: bot-T PING!
10:40  pixeltarian: for example:  <div id="cool"> the thing is neat, [insert 43 more paragraphs] </div>
10:40  badsyntax: myNewbie you have all types of errors in that klink
10:40 * myNewbie slaps bot-t around a bit with a large trout
10:40 * bot-t dodges myNewbie's attack and slaps back!
10:40  badsyntax: your  selectors need to be wrapped in quote to begin with
10:40  pixeltarian: if "the thing is neat" leaves the page, my neat "cool is off the page now" animation triggers.
10:40  pixeltarian: but there's still 43 more paragraphs to go before it's truly off screen.
10:41  pixeltarian: does that make sense?
10:41  myNewbie: badsyntax...can you show me directly into code?
10:42  twsowerby: I cant seem to get my jquery.post working properly
10:42  myNewbie: sorry bot-t...wrong click
10:45  pixeltarian: http://jeffreyjamesmusic.110mb.com//oldjunk/JStesting/appleBottom.html
10:45  pixeltarian: can't seem to get the entire element to react
10:45  JenniferB2: how can I force show or force hide an element, no matter if it has a class with display:none; or style="display:none";  ? without animation ...
10:45  lithi: pixeltarian: huh?
10:45  BEEPBEEP_: so, myNewbie, logs came through?
10:46  pixeltarian: if you scroll down the page slow
10:46  lithi: JenniferB2: hide();
10:46  BEEPBEEP_: more importantly, what did the console.log(text) output?
10:46  lithi: $("div").hide();
10:46  pixeltarian: you'll see
10:46  talented: JenniferB2, css supports !importance
10:46  pixeltarian: cpm
10:46  badsyntax: !hotdog
10:46  pixeltarian: the links at the top react
10:46  badsyntax: :)
10:46  pixeltarian: they'll highlight red
10:46  pixeltarian: but it's in a janky way for a split second
10:47  lithi: pixeltarian: what's supposed to highlight in red?
10:47  twsowerby: can't get my jquery post to work, can anyone help? http://jsfiddle.net/mCmbw/
10:47  pixeltarian: I'm trying to get them to be red based on any part of the element being in the top 60% of the screen
10:47  myNewbie: BEEPBEEP....i'm newby using console...
10:47  pixeltarian: lithi, the links in the fixed div
10:47  BEEPBEEP_: myNewbie, download firebug
10:47  lithi: twsowerby: try alert(data);
10:47  pixeltarian: they will bgcolor red if you scroll down the page nice and slow
10:48  lithi: pixeltarian: they dont :o
10:48  myNewbie: when i go to use console.log(change) ...it show me 'undefined'
10:48  talented: JenniferB2, so if you had display:none !important... it'll override all other displays on that element so that this one will always stand out
10:48  pixeltarian: they do for me
10:48  myNewbie: i already have one..
10:48  BEEPBEEP_: yes, that's normal, myNewbie..
10:48  BEEPBEEP_: you gotta quote
10:48  pixeltarian: you're scrolling slowly?
10:48  BEEPBEEP_: 'change'
10:48  pixeltarian: because it only works for a second, when the selector is in the perfect page position
10:48  myNewbie: so any hints for my code?
10:49  BEEPBEEP_: that means, everytime the change event is triggered you'll see 'change' in the console
10:49  lithi: pixeltarian: oh yeah they do
10:49  myNewbie: ok let me add quote now
10:49 --- raccoon is now known as raccoon_
10:49  BEEPBEEP_: that way, you know, the change event is triggered
10:49  BEEPBEEP_: then you move on
10:49  BEEPBEEP_: you check the value of your text variable
10:49  BEEPBEEP_: by doing console.log(text) (no quotes here because text is a variable)
10:49  lithi: pixeltarian: actually you dont have to scroll down slow
10:49  JenniferB2: talented: we can ignore the !important.. but I want to override all possible implementations that might come from css
10:49  twsowerby: lithi: aha, getting null. im trying to call a specific function within the process.php file, have I done it the right way in the post?
10:49  JenniferB2: i never use !important anyway
10:50  BEEPBEEP_: so you get to seein your console, what the value of your selectbox is every time the change event is triggered
10:50  BEEPBEEP_: and you go from there
10:50  talented: you mean ignore the styling from css?
10:50  talented: like all styling?
10:50  lithi: twsowerby: are you echoing the right stuff in the php file?
10:50  pixeltarian: is only triggering when the last line in the element is in the top 100 pixels of the screen?
10:50  pixeltarian: (I mean I think that's what it's doing)
10:51  pixeltarian: I'm wondering how to make it trigger when any part of the element is in that area
10:51  myNewbie: in my console it show correct value based on each select option
10:51  Hishi[Revo]: Hey. i've included the jquery lib but cant get $('#id') to work. for somereason. im trying to update a value with a simple onclick event by calling $('#id of input box').value='New val'; Is there something ive missed?
10:51  twsowerby: lithi: the php has a function that encodes the result as json and returns it
10:51  myNewbie: now it goes to if condition
10:52  JenniferB2: lithi: if the element has a css class with display:none.. and I do element.css('display', 'what here !imporant') ..
10:52  JenniferB2: lithi: it should be empty to show..
10:52  JenniferB2: what is the show value of display ?
10:52  lithi: JenniferB2: not sure I follow, what are you trying to achieve?
10:52  myNewbie: $('#amName').show();  ----> nothing action is trigger
10:52  lithi: display:block/inline-block/inline/etc;
10:53  lithi: those are the most used anyway
10:53  talented: JenniferB2, depends on the element, jquery show hide, also stores the element information so it can revert back
10:53  lithi: talented: it does? oO
10:53  lithi: never knew
10:53  JenniferB2: talented: but doesn't that method animate ?
10:53  lithi: JenniferB2: no it doesnt
10:53  talented: now
10:53  talented: no*
10:53  lithi: hide(); sets display:none; show; sets displaY:block;
10:53  BEEPBEEP_: well
10:53  BEEPBEEP_: myNewbie
10:53  BEEPBEEP_: you forgot quotes
10:54  BEEPBEEP_: $('#amName').show();
10:54  BEEPBEEP_: and you forgot them everywhere
10:54  JenniferB2: lithi: yes.. but I don't want it go back to block.. i just want the display to be removed basically .. i can't hardcode it to be a block element
10:54  pixeltarian: here's another example where the opening div triggers:
10:54  pixeltarian: http://jeffreyjamesmusic.110mb.com//oldjunk/JStesting/tippyTop.html
10:54  lithi: JenniferB2: so you want it to be removed instead of hiding it?
10:56 --- riven` is now known as riven
10:56  lithi: JenniferB2: http://api.jquery.com/detach/
10:56  JenniferB2: lithi: no.. i want the display:none; to be ignored.  to be removed.. like it was never added.. doing display:block; is something entirely differnt.. what if the element was originally an inline element ?
10:57  lithi: you can do $("div").show().css('display','inline');
10:57  Hishi[Revo]: i think show/hide is the way to go for you JenniferB2
10:57  myNewbie: BEEPBEEP_ thanks in advance...working now :)
10:57  lithi: I actually had a similiar problem yesterday, element was returning to block instead of inline-block; so I just used that to override the block
10:57  JKarsrud: Doesn't show remember the initial styling, if it was inline
10:57  JenniferB2: .show .hide doesn't work properly in IE.. not working now either
10:58  JKarsrud: JenniferB2: Uhm, doesn't work properly?
10:58  talented: JenniferB2, if the element was inline when you hide() it, jquery stores that information, so that when you show() it... it's back to being inline
10:58  JenniferB2: don't matter.. i guess i just have to put the display:none in the style tag of the elemetn
10:58  JenniferB2: talented: it's not working in ie with show hide
10:58  twsowerby: lithi: any idea what i might be doing wrong?
10:58  talented: what version?
10:59  pixeltarian: so we can do http://jeffreyjamesmusic.110mb.com//oldjunk/JStesting/tippyTop.html and http://jeffreyjamesmusic.110mb.com/oldjunk/JStesting/appleBottom.html [03:56] <pixeltarian> but not maintain the css swap for the entire element?
10:59  lithi: twsowerby: sorry missed your chat, can you repaste + whats the problem?
10:59  Hishi[Revo]: IE shoudnt have any problem with CSS display. so the problem is prob not the show/hide in itself
10:59  pixeltarian: (posted that in the wrong channel oopsies)
11:00  lithi: yeah IE isnt giving me any problems with show(); hide(); fadeIn/Out(); or any of those
11:00  lithi: Working oddly good actually
11:00  Hishi[Revo]: hehe
11:00  JenniferB2: Hishi[Revo]: the thing is that if I remove the display:none; from my css or style.. the element is displayed on load.. so there are issue..
11:01  lithi: JenniferB2: paste some code
11:01  lithi: so we can have a little idea
11:01  bnb_dev: i want to acces the image in layout default.ctp , and i use this  echo $html->imgage("home.png"); , it gives error,  ": Method HtmlHelper::imgage does not exist "
11:01  JKarsrud: imgage?
11:01  lithi: bnb_dev: sure its not image(); ?
11:01  JKarsrud: and wtf are you talking about?
11:02  twsowerby: lithi: can't seem to get my post working. link to the code I'm using is here: http://jsfiddle.net/mCmbw/2/
11:02  lithi: ooh yeah
11:02  lithi: hmm
11:03  JenniferB2: lithi: to much code.. the only way I have ever gotten these things to work properly is by adding a class .hide { display:none } add it to the element and do.. element.addClass('hide'); element.removeClass('hide'); i am guessing I have to give up and do that again...
11:03  bnb_dev: how to access the HTML helper in layout?
11:03  twsowerby: the php function returns a json encoded array array("test"=>"test return data");
11:03  twsowerby: but I get null in my alert
11:03  lithi: mmh
11:04  lithi: maybe your not pointing at the array correctly on the jquery side
11:05  lithi: and to be honest I've noidea since your using JSON, I usually just
11:08  twsowerby: lithi: actually no worries, think I may have figured it out
11:08  sean`: BMCouto,
11:08  sean`: did you read that thing I gave you
11:09  lithi: twsowerby: http://pastie.org/1325165 wont return an array but a number which then again can be determined in jquery to forward to the right action
11:09  sean`: BMCouto, ?
11:10  sean`: BMCouto, say something
11:11  Adriaan: hi, I would like to build connectable lists in such way that when one element moves from list A to list B that the last element of list B goes to the first element of list C, but I have no idea how to do this, can anyone point me in the right direction?
11:13  sean`: BMCouto, are you ignoring me?
11:13  twsowerby: thanks lithi
11:14  twsowerby: i got it working. didnt realise that I couldnt wrap my php in a callable function, rather than just a standalone script if that makes sense. rather than return json_encode… i just took it out of the function and echoed it.
11:14  twsowerby: works now and i can pick out the exact parts of the data I want inside my jquery
11:15  lithi: Yeah twsowerby the response is always echoed :-)
11:15  lithi: I need to learn up the use of JSON aswell :| might make my stuff take less code and less work
11:15  sean`: lithi, it's wonderful
11:15  lithi: Yeah so i've heard
11:15  sean`: I LOVE JASON
11:15  sean`: ?fdi JASON, I
11:15  bot-t: JASON, I FUCKING DICK IT
11:15  lithi: but the fact I just learned how ajax works
11:16  JonKirkpatrick: jason is a cool guy
11:16  sean`: lithi, it's not complex
11:16  sean`: it's easy
11:16  lithi: Yeah?
11:16  sean`: yeah man
11:16  sean`: lithi, just need to know two things
11:16  sean`: JSON means JavaScript Object Notation and is ALWAYS  a string
11:16  lithi: twsowerby: can you link the working codes jquery and php side?
11:16  sean`: which you can validate using jsonlint.com
11:17  clu3: hi, is there a way to check if a variable is a valid json data?
11:17  sean`: Second of all, you can parse a JSON string and it becomes a hashtable/object
11:17  sean`: <sean`> which you can validate using jsonlint.com clu3
11:17  sean`: clu3, also you cn do a try catch on $.parseJSON

11:17  twsowerby: lithi: yeah give me a sec
11:17  lonimurar: I'm togging a <div> with an image (on hover) and hiding the <div> by default with css (display:none;) instead of jquery (hide();) because that way I can avoid flash of content on page load. major downside though: people with javascript off won't see the <div> (which contains content). anything I can do?
11:18  sean`: BMCouto, you suck
11:18  clu3: sean`, JonKirkpatrick thanks guys
11:18  sean`: lonimurar, add a <link stylesheet> in <noscript>
11:18  lithi: lonimurar: make the user put js on or install it :D
11:18  sean`: or <style>
11:18  JonKirkpatrick: lonimurar tell them to turn js on?
11:18  sean`: and link to www.enable-javascript.com
11:18  JonKirkpatrick: a very small percent don't have JS enabled
11:19  sean`: I don't have JS
11:19  JonKirkpatrick: that makes you... small?

11:19  lonimurar: sean`: thanks
11:25  red: how would you resolve an issue when you have 512px wide images on the front page in a column, teasers below, and you were asked to fit 500px wide images in the mix?
11:26  timing: red: give all the images a wrapper div of 512px
11:26  timing: with a nice border
11:26  red: thats what I've done so far, but the right edges are misaligned, using padding\border for the remaining 6px on left and right looks bad aswell
11:26  timing: and put the image in the center of its wrapper
11:26  red: im just thinking the most neat way would be somehow to mirror the bgimage of the div to all directions so it would seem like it continues for those 6px to left and right
11:26  timing: sounds too much work for something simple
11:27  red: it would be a good solution since we cache our site to visitors, so it being heavy is no prob
11:27  timing: how come the right edges are misaligned?
11:27  red: I mean if the image is 500px, the container width and other images are 512px
11:27  twsowerby: lithi: jquery is here http://jsfiddle.net/mCmbw/3/ and php is here: http://pastie.org/1325186
11:27  red: you can see the image starts 6px later and ends 6px later (when using centered bg with no-repeat)
11:27  timing: yeah and if you give it a border?
11:27  red: looks bad, white bg layout
11:28  red: on dark bg it would be quite easy to make a neat border
11:28  timing: just a tiny sweet #ddd border ?
11:28  red: i've been fiddling around with it for 30min :)
11:28  timing: hmm ok
11:28  red: can't come up with anything that would look nice heh
11:28  timing: and no designer around?
11:28  red: hence the mirroring the bg idea, just wondered there might be some trick with jQuery
11:28  red: our designer is a blind baboon
11:28  lithi: twsowerby: whoa
11:28  timing: lol
11:29  red: luckily only a trainee so :)
11:29  lithi: I thought responsing an array would be harder :D
11:29  lithi: looks actually quite simple
11:29  timing: red: css3 has this mirroring, but IE is left out then
11:29  timing: and what if you crop the 512 images to 500 ?
11:29  twsowerby: lithi: yeah…it's not bad
11:29  twsowerby: haha my erros were coming from everything else i did
11:29  JonKirkpatrick: twsowerby that php hurts my head
11:30  twsowerby: JonKirkpatrick: why, because its badly written?
11:30  red: one solution yeah, I think I'll go with CSS3 and not give a flying **** about IE :)
11:31  talented: what's worse badly or poorly?
11:31  JonKirkpatrick: i always advocate creating code that people can read
11:31  twsowerby: they're about equal
11:32  JonKirkpatrick: I can understand what it does
11:32  JonKirkpatrick: but i have to read into it
11:32  twsowerby: ah ok…pointers? pretty new to php
11:32  JonKirkpatrick: none really, it just takes time
11:32  JonKirkpatrick: you'll learn with experience
11:33  ravenzz: and studying
11:33  talented: twsowerby, drop the preg matches, you got some weird matches asking for case insensitive and they're only numbers :/
11:33  ravenzz: :p
11:33  CGo: Does anyone if it's possible to pass a Javascript function using JSON from PHP?
11:33  CGo: Or is it possible to define a string containing Javascript code as a function inside JS?
11:34  twsowerby: talented: yeah, only just learny about preg_match. think i need them as the $domain result returns an utterly useless string, rather than just a code
11:34  talented: CGo, that's usually the intention of using JSON, is that it can be mapped into JS
11:34  JonKirkpatrick: maybe parse url will help you twsowerby
11:34  CGo: talented, the latter solution would be ideal though.
11:34  Hishi[Revo]: im trying to populate a input field with a ajax response. but when i try document.getElementById('inputfield').value= $.ajax.responseText; i get the correct value in the response but in the input field it says Undefined. :( what should i do to output the response text correctly?
11:35  CGo: E.g. | var code = 'alert("test");'; $(selector).click(function() code);
11:35  talented: twsowerby, you should try to avoid any regular expression searches, unless it's the utmost necessary and only way to do it
11:35  JonKirkpatrick: im not exactly sure what you are trying to do...
11:35  JonKirkpatrick: doesn't js have an eval
11:35  ravenzz: have to use eval
11:36  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, after the function scope ends the variable with the code is destroyed though.
11:36  coldhead: anyone for cyber PM me
11:36  ravenzz: rotfl
11:36  JonKirkpatrick: then assign it to a global?
11:36  CGo: So it'd be attempting an eval(undefined);
11:36  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, that's a real dirty solution though.
11:36  ravenzz: /msg coldhead hello
11:36  ravenzz: lol
11:36  JonKirkpatrick: so is passing in js from php?
11:37  JonKirkpatrick: func?
11:37  CGo: Not necessarily.
11:37  JonKirkpatrick: what are you trying to do
11:37  CGo: I'm dynamically adding buttons to a list and assigning scripts to their click event.
11:37  CGo: The script is defined elsewhere on the server.
11:37  darkmist: i m trying to call a script when a button (id=button) is clicked (with jQuery Mobile). However, i get an error "#button".click() is not a function. can someone tell me where I m going wrong?.
11:38  JonKirkpatrick: ok that seems resonible CGo
11:38  twsowerby: talented - ok, but the function that checks the domains availability (which i have no control over, its an api) returns a string like: "304 - domain taken, registered until date"
11:38  twsowerby: i just wanted the "304" bit
11:38  JonKirkpatrick: does it return more than a string twsowerby
11:38  ravenzz: darkmist $('#button').click(function() { doSomething });
11:39  ravenzz: if you have more than one button you have to use .each
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: or just a string
11:39  red: timing: couldnt actually find anything about CSS3 mirror background
11:39  twsowerby: Jon - no - just that string
11:39  talented: I haven't used PHP in yonks, but strpos would be the best way to find it
11:39  red: just multiple backgrounds meh
11:39  sean`: BMCouto, ?
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: are they all formmated the same?
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: <response> - <message>
11:39  sean`: JonKirkpatrick, is this you? http://www.johnkirkpatrick.co.uk/
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: no
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: lololol
11:39  sean`: :p
11:39  JonKirkpatrick: thats funny
11:40  twsowerby: talented: it doesnt seem like a particularly well written api - some of the returned results have the code at the beginning and some have it at a different position  in the string.
11:40  darkmist: ravenzz: thats what I tried - $('#button').click(function() { doSomething });
11:40  talented: doesn't matter where it is in the string, strpos will return boolean false if not found or a number of where it's position is
11:41  ravenzz: darkmist jsfiddle.net paste your code here
11:41  JonKirkpatrick: twsowerby, that sucks.. lol
11:41  JonKirkpatrick: I would suggest creating a wrapper around the api
11:41  JonKirkpatrick: and calling functions to check certain conditions
11:41  twsowerby: ah - ok that makes sense.
11:42  JonKirkpatrick: if ( blnOkDomain($domain) )
11:42  JonKirkpatrick: etc
11:42  JonKirkpatrick: or create a class
11:45  CGo: So, anyone got a clue on how a string could be converted to a function?
11:45  twsowerby: ok, thanks Jon - will look into that
11:45  vidarw: Hi! Is there a way to get a jQuery UI accordion to use variable height on the different elements?
11:45  JonKirkpatrick: i think your only method is eval
11:45  darkmist: ravenzz: any idea why I get the ".click() is not a function" & .bind() is not a function" error?
11:45  JonKirkpatrick: just guessing here...
11:45  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, I dearly hope not :(
11:45  JonKirkpatrick: how many scripts are we talking here
11:45  JonKirkpatrick: do they all change?
11:45  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, an indefinite amount. Let me explain more thoroughly..
11:45  timing: red: http://webkit.org/blog/182/css-reflections/
11:45  ravenzz: CGo put your code into vars and then eval it
11:45  ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/AJEp8/
11:46  CGo: I'm working out a plugin that queries the server with a menu ID when the mouseenter is triggered, creates a menu DIV with an UL and then populates the UL with buttons retrieved from the server. Serverside, each button is associated with a Javascript.
11:46  ravenzz: darkmist if you'll paste your code on jsfiddle i'll can take a look
11:46  CGo: So, it gets the json, assigns the button titles/icons etc., and then would bind that script with its click event.
11:47  NET||abuse: hi there folks. I am stuck, i don't see what it is that IE doesn't like this  http://client2.test.featured.ie
11:47  ravenzz: CGo http://jsfiddle.net/AJEp8/ could help you?
11:47  CGo: Putting an eval(data.action); in the click event would run eval(undefined); once the event is actually triggered, and I'd really like to avoid globals.
11:48  JonKirkpatrick: then just put it inside the onclick event
11:48  JonKirkpatrick: lol
11:48  ravenzz: you have to trigger that even on json callback
11:48  CGo: ravenzz, unfortunately no.
11:48  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, there's another thing I'd like to avoid :(
11:48  ravenzz: not on ready
11:48  ravenzz: or so
11:48  JonKirkpatrick: ok, so what do you want to do
11:48  JonKirkpatrick: execute it when its clicked?
11:48  CGo: Exactly.
11:48  JonKirkpatrick: without globals or evals?
11:49  CGo: The string that's declared within the scope of the $.ajax success() function, needs to be bound as a function to the click event.
11:49  CGo: Without globals or eval, yes.
11:49  ravenzz: without eval
11:49  ravenzz: you cant.
11:49  CGo: Hmm..
11:49  ravenzz: also why dont use eval?
11:49  ravenzz: :|
11:49  CGo: ravenzz, because the string containing the code is declared within that success() scope.
11:50  CGo: It's destroyed once the buttons are defined.
11:50  JonKirkpatrick: well without globals or evals I can only think of assigning the buttons one live event click and passing in parameters back to the server to execute a compiled function
11:50  darkmist: ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/CwXvf/
11:50  CGo: I think you're onto something there JonKirkpatrick.
11:50  ravenzz: CGo then you can bind your events on complete
11:51 --- okaycool_ is now known as okaycool
11:51  ravenzz: or success
11:51  CGo: ravenzz, how?
11:51  JonKirkpatrick: but you'd still have to use eval once the code is returned in your ExecuteJS function or w.e
11:51  CGo: I was hoping there'd be a parseFunc() function or something along those lines.
11:51  ravenzz: as you trigger that usually
11:51  CGo: Or that $(selector).click(function() string_with_function_code); would work.
11:52  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, using eval *then* isn't an issue. I just want to avoid using global variables.
11:52  JonKirkpatrick: click ( string_function_code );
11:52  JonKirkpatrick: does that work?
11:52  CGo: Hmm.. Let me try.
11:52  darkmist: ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/CwXvf/3/
11:52  JonKirkpatrick: probably still have to eval it, who knows
11:53  JonKirkpatrick: be a good question for hiring someone
11:53  JonKirkpatrick: lol
11:53  ravenzz: darkmist http://jsfiddle.net/CwXvf/4/
11:53  ravenzz: darkmist read something about jquery from the official doc page :)
11:53 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
11:54  ravenzz: btw you can use <button> instead of <div>
11:55  JonKirkpatrick: CGo don't think that will work
11:55  darkmist: thanks ravenzz: let me check
11:56  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, it didn't..
11:56  JonKirkpatrick: CGo if you are not worried about an extra call to the server, you can do what I suggested
11:56  JonKirkpatrick: if you don't want to use globals
11:56  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, probably the best solution yeah.
11:56  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, I'd like to avoid it since I'm building this as a plugin.
11:57  JonKirkpatrick: hmm, some developers might not like that extra call
11:57  CGo: JonKirkpatrick, they can suck it!
11:57  JonKirkpatrick: lol
11:57  CGo: Seriously though, globals are starting to look more appealing..
11:58  ravenzz: CGo i think that you can easily bind those event on ajax success
11:58  ravenzz: and not before.. without using globals
11:58  JonKirkpatrick: yeah that might work
11:58  JonKirkpatrick: on the callback just stick it in a bind
11:58  JonKirkpatrick: makes sense
11:59  CGo: Think you can pass a string using bind()?
11:59  ravenzz: man
11:59  JonKirkpatrick: lol
11:59  ravenzz: $('#wtf').click(function() { eval(yourstingcode) });
11:59  ravenzz: it's all
11:59  JonKirkpatrick: ^^
12:00  JonKirkpatrick: assuming all that is happening is a click event
12:01  JonKirkpatrick: but if not you can just add additional variables to your php callback
12:01  JonKirkpatrick: target, method, strFunctions
12:01  JonKirkpatrick: etc
12:01  JonKirkpatrick: then just use bind
12:02  JonKirkpatrick: ('#' + data.target).bind(data.method, function() { eval(data.strfunction) });
12:03  enerel: anyone know José Nobile

12:05  Jarda: ?
12:05  thiago_: Jarda, but the css will not be loaded :(
12:05  Jarda: or even $(html).load(url); ?

12:06  Jarda: well, that's not kinda "ajax"
12:06  JonKirkpatrick: sure it is
12:06  JonKirkpatrick: put it in the ajax callback
12:06  JonKirkpatrick: lol
12:06  thiago_: i want make a refresh with fade
12:06  enerel: :p
12:06  Jarda: hmm?
12:06  Jarda: JonKirkpatrick: you are kidding, right?
12:06  Jarda: there's nothing "ajax" in refreshing a page completely..
12:07  JonKirkpatrick: he used the word refresh
12:07  JonKirkpatrick: not replace
12:07  Jarda: and "via ajax"
12:07  Cork: Jarda: there is no way to refresh css without reloading the page
12:07  CGo: ravenzz, the problem there is that $(selector).click(function() { eval(data.code_string); }); will eventually execute eval(undefined); once the click event is triggered.
12:07  Jarda: Cork: that might be entirely true
12:07  Cork: Jarda: except manually removing rule sets....
12:07  enerel: how to dynamically change iframe content flash wmode=transparent or make invisible on some event? any idea
12:09  Jarda: enerel: no need to ask twice. If someone answers, then he answers.. It helps if you show some code of your issue
12:10  JonKirkpatrick: CGo anyway you can store that information in the DOM and access it when say, the button is clicked?

12:26  Lumpio-: Also you can give names to "anonymous" functions if you want to.
12:26  Lumpio-: It's not required though
12:27  coldhead: enerel: maybe what you want is to show a modal (like jQuery UI dialog) over the page with a mesage like "Now loading..." and have the $(iframe).load() handler remove the dialog
12:28  enerel: coldhead: sorry i didnt understand it you mean use UI modal instead of colorbox?

12:39  coldhead: ha, apparently there is such a thing
12:39  Mr_Nobody: sean`: AH
12:39  coldhead: well spotted, sean`
12:39  Mr_Nobody: Yes, thank you sean`!!!
12:39  JonKirkpatrick: oh oh oh closest goes up the dom
12:39  JonKirkpatrick: dang! too late
12:39  lonimurar: http://jsfiddle.net/xX55d/2/ - I'm still getting # in the URL, what am I doing wrong?
12:39  coldhead: bot-t: tell sean THANK YOU SOOOO MUCHHHZOMGGGG
12:39  bot-t: coldhead, Okay.
12:39  Mr_Nobody: So i should use .next instead??
12:39  sean`: ping
12:40  BEEPBEEP_: http://codepad.org/mc8wcHBm gives me the error : unterminated string literal. can anyone see it? thx in advance
12:40  sean`: BEEPBEEP_, you can't just do newlines
12:40  Carneque: http://pastebin.com/676qGtk6
12:40  BEEPBEEP_: they arent newlines, i formated it that way
12:40  BEEPBEEP_: :$
12:40  BEEPBEEP_: to make it readable
12:41  sean`: well dont
12:42  sean`: CUTE http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/foto/b3e395ad_qSNCL.jpg
12:42  nlogax: is that you mr koole?
12:43  sean`: chillin in the house, homez
12:43  aro: is there a good plugin for creating a sliding bottom panel
12:43  Kaapa: sean`: oh, f*ck off!
12:44 * Kaapa needs to remeber never to follow random links
12:46  nlogax: i can't see what you said to sean`, one of the letters turned into an asterisk!
12:46  Carneque: nm on my question
12:46  Carneque: I figured out the weird script error
12:48  Darsain: do you guys know about any plugin that replaces form elements with something I can style, BUT at the same time has some fallback support for changing the state of the original elements with javascript? like if I'll do $("input:checkbox").attr("checked","checked"), than the replaced element will update itself too
12:49  coldhead: i have to pee real bad but the bathroom is downstairs. what can i do, using jQuery?
12:49  Carneque: haha
12:49  Mr_Nobody: I need to do something to a div that is not empty.. how would i do that?
12:49  Carneque: replace computer with toliet
12:49  aro: Mr_Nobody: what do you want to do with it
12:50  Mr_Nobody: aro: I have this script, but it does not return the non-empty selector.
12:50  Mr_Nobody: if ($(".isnotemptyclass").is(":empty")){ } else { $(this).closest(".link-class").click(function() { alert("warning"); });
12:50  Mr_Nobody: I am doing something wrong, but cant figure out what
12:51  aro:  if ($(".isnotemptyclass:empty")){ } else { $(this).closest(".link-class").click(function() { alert("warning"); });
12:51  maushu: Anyone had problem setting ui's datepicker multiple times?
12:51  aro: maushu: nope
12:51  Mr_Nobody: aro: Hm, il try it
12:51  lonimurar: http://jsfiddle.net/xX55d/2/ - I'm still getting # in the URL, what am I doing wrong?
12:52  aro: lonimurar: function( event ) { }
12:52  Mr_Nobody: aro: same result
12:52  maushu: When I set it on the second textbox it sends the date to the first one when picked.
12:52  aro: instead of function() { }
12:52  beevi7: hey guys
12:52  beevi7: i need a quick hint
12:52  Carneque: hi beevi
12:52  aro: $('a.button').click( function( event ) { });
12:52  beevi7: i wanna change an attribute of an input button with a certain html5 data attribute
12:52  lonimurar: aro: ty
12:53  aro: you need to pass the event param to the function
12:53  lonimurar: yeah I know, forgot it *blush*
12:53  beevi7: <input type="button" disabled="disabled" data-issue="1" />
12:53  Mr_Nobody: aro: it gave the same result, no selector found even though itś there.
12:53  aro: Mr_Nobody: jsfiddle it
12:53  ravenzz: Mr_Nobody$(".isnotemptyclass").html() == ''
12:53  ravenzz: :?
12:53  lonimurar: aro: btw, toggling the <div> with clicking doesn't work that well, could you take a look please?
12:53  beevi7: something like: $('input').data('issue').is(1).attr('disabled', false)
12:54  beevi7: any idea how?
12:54  Carneque: http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
12:54  lonimurar: aro: clicking on .button will make the <div> visible, clicking it again should hide it; it'll only hide it after you've clicked AND moved away from the .button though
12:54  ravenzz: beevi7 $('input[issue="1"]).attr('disabled', false)
12:54  aro: you could use fadeToggle
12:54  aro: @ lonimurar
12:54  ravenzz: forget a '
12:54  Mr_Nobody: aro: ok
12:54  ravenzz: beevi7 $('input[issue="1"]').attr('disabled', false)
12:55  beevi7: input[issue="1"]? not input[data-issue="1"] or similar?
12:55  beevi7: just input?
12:55  beevi7: uuuhm issue?
12:55  ravenzz: yes
12:55  ravenzz: sorry
12:55  ravenzz: data-issue
12:55  beevi7: ah, okay ;)
12:55  beevi7: thanks
12:55  maushu: Found the problem.
12:55  beevi7: pretty logical
12:56  maushu: For anyone who cares, the textboxes need to have (different) ids.
12:56  maushu: For the datepicker to work correctly.
12:56  aro: maushu: isnt that assumed you would know that?
12:56  ravenzz: :d
12:57  maushu: Not really, since I dynamically created the textboxes.
12:57  jomofcw: Any known issue about slectable with the lastest version of UI and jQuery
12:57  aro: dynamically give em id's too ;)
12:57  maushu: No need for ids when you can just reference them using variables though.
12:57  maushu: They now have random ids.
12:58  wlievens: I have a chunk of text that contains html. I want to extract a portion of that html using jQuery using a selector. How can I do this?
12:59  wlievens: so it would be something like this:    $.parse(content).find(selector)
12:59  lonimurar: aro: I can't figure it out, could you take a look at it please? :/
12:59  wlievens: (but there is no $.parse of course)
12:59  wlievens: what tried was: create a temporary dom element and append(content)
12:59  lithi: So what went wrong?
12:59  wlievens: but if the html contains <script> tags etc, it loads them!
12:59  maushu: wlievens: $(selector).html() ?
13:00  wlievens: maushu: that seems like the other way around, I don't need that
13:00  aro: lonimurar: http://jsfiddle.net/xX55d/3/
13:01  aro: fadeToggle was added in 1.4.4
13:01  wlievens: maushu: ah you mean the 'setter' version. It's still no good because it forces the <script> tags to be loaded
13:01  wlievens: I want to extract just the portion I care about
13:01  maushu: wlievens: Well, first turn that chunk of text into html with $(chunk) then use find like you said to find the html you want then use the html(), like this: $(chunk).find(selector).html();
13:01  wlievens: let me try that
13:02  maushu: You could probably remove script nodes using regex on the text before using the chunk of text.
13:02 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:03  lonimurar: aro: what about the hovering though?
13:04  wlievens: maushu: similar things happen when I do that
13:04  wlievens: the script tags are resolved
13:06  BEEPBEEP_: Question: I have a selectbox of class 'x'. $('x').change(console.log('foo')); when I clone this selectbox and append it, the change event does not get triggered in the cloned object
13:07  BEEPBEEP_: $('.x') for the antfuckers amongst us
13:07  BEEPBEEP_: :P
13:08  wlievens: is 'antfucker' an expression in english?
13:08  maushu: wlievens: You can remove the scripts from the text before parsing.
13:08  wlievens: it is in dutch (mierenneuker) but since you're in sweden I'm having trouble seeing where it comes from
13:09  wlievens: maushu: yeah with some regex magic I guess
13:09  Mr_Nobody: aro:http://jsfiddle.net/2hwAU/14/
13:09  wlievens: or I could strip the tag I want with regex (and then have somebody show me that SO post that says you CANNOT)
13:10  maushu: wlievens: chunk_of_text.replace(/<script[\s\S]+(</script>|/>)/ig, '');
13:10  Mr_Nobody: aro: Sorry, wrong variable name http://jsfiddle.net/2hwAU/15/
13:10  wlievens: right, thanks, that saves me some searching :-)
13:10  maushu: Bah, it's faster for me to write from scratch instead of searching.
13:11  BEEPBEEP_: wlievens
13:11  BEEPBEEP_: I'm from belgium
13:11  BEEPBEEP_: and yes I know it's nitpicker in english
13:11  BEEPBEEP_: but who cares? except you.
13:11  BEEPBEEP_: :p
13:11  lonimurar: aro: what about the hovering though? :/
13:11  wlievens: ah you're from belgium, dan versta ik het :-)
13:12 * maushu nukes Belgium.
13:13  lonimurar: don't.
13:15  compaq: How can I use jquery to make my website look nice if I don't have a lot of artistic flare and lot of experience working with css background images by page splicing
13:16  compaq: I thought UI was the answer, but I don't know, it seems like just a collection of a few plugins
13:16  maushu: compaq: Well all else fails, use lots of fading, round corners and gradients.
13:17  Mr_Nobody: maushu: lol
13:18  maushu: jQuery will not help you in the artistic department, UI are basically controls with themes.
13:18  Mr_Nobody: maushu: dont forget gradiented corners
13:18  compaq: maushu, are there functions for that?  I tried the plugin jquery.corners.js, but it didn't work with IE
13:18  maushu: Mr_Nobody: You shall not speak of the holy grail.
13:18  JonKirkpatrick: try photoshop
13:18  JonKirkpatrick: lol
13:18  JonKirkpatrick: or just get a wordpress / drupal theme
13:18  JonKirkpatrick: and call it a day
13:18  maushu: compaq: I usually ignore IE and make round corners for the other browsers.
13:18  JonKirkpatrick: obviously being sarcastic
13:19  Mr_Nobody: I think aro left, can anyone else help me get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/2hwAU/15/
13:19  maushu: I ignore IE on many things.
13:19  enerel: i have conflict issue: http://www.mongolio.com/toolbar/ top toolbar menu Бусад should open colorbox but it does not...?
13:19  compaq: JonKirkpatrick, Well, I was thinking of using a css/xhtml template.  But its a pain to customize when you didn't design it yourself
13:19  maushu: Mr_Nobody: What are you trying to do?
13:20  Mr_Nobody: maushu: When clicking the green box, an alert with the "Not Empty" text should appear, when clicking the green box next to an empty box, no allert should appear
13:22  maushu: Mr_Nobody: Well, first you need to find a way to connect the green boxes to their parents.
13:22  maushu: Unless you want to go rambo.
13:22  Mr_Nobody: I use .next?
13:23  maushu: Thats going rambo.
13:23  maushu: Anyways, that code is ugly.
13:23 * maushu fixes code.
13:23  Mr_Nobody: It is
13:23  Mr_Nobody: thanks :)
13:23  Mr_Nobody: Im lucky there is people that know what they are doing ;)

13:29 --- Killswitch__ is now known as Killswitch
13:29  maushu: No prob.
13:30  Mr_Nobody: Heh... there will be a _lot_ of bound click events though, i have about 100 boxes on the live page
13:30  Mr_Nobody: i dont know if that would be a problem on slow machines with IE7
13:31  Mr_Nobody: maushu: what do you think, would that be a problem?
13:31  maushu: Mr_Nobody: Hmm, use live.
13:31  Mr_Nobody: maushu: .live?
13:31  maushu: http://jsfiddle.net/2hwAU/24/
13:32  Mr_Nobody: maushu: Wouldnt that be even heavier? .live is intended when using ajax right?
13:33  maushu: No, live catches the events at the top of the chain.
13:33  maushu: It's like a catch-all event that only fires for clicks on specific elements.
13:33  Mr_Nobody: Hm, wierd, i got warned not to use to much .live earlier in this channel.
13:33  maushu: Better use one live than 100 click events.
13:34  enerel: what is the opposite of stopPropagation()
13:34  Mr_Nobody: maushu: Ok, really good to know! Thanks!!
13:38  jetienne: enerel: no opposite. this is the default

13:53  JKarsrud: enerel
13:53  enerel: yes
13:54  JKarsrud: Typo somewhere? Maybe you tried doing $("li a") but wrote $("lia")?
13:54  enerel: oh
13:54  JKarsrud: Looks like it, do you have som codE?
13:54  enerel: thats right
13:54  Trisox: lia :D haha
13:54  enerel: hehehe
13:54  JKarsrud: was I correct?
13:54  JKarsrud: Damn
13:54  Trisox: made me laugh
13:54  JKarsrud: :P
13:54  Trisox: not me
13:54  enerel: yes ofcourse i did
13:55  enerel: it was all variable i should add space there

13:55  Trisox: :O
13:55  Trisox: whats the best way to manipulate ajax results? like for example table striped?
13:56  JKarsrud: Trisox: Do it in the callback?
13:56  JKarsrud: on complete or success or something :)
13:56  Trisox: http://vospascal.nl/patrick/
13:56  Trisox: check
13:56  Trisox: just press  get results
13:56  enerel: oops now i got uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLLIElement]
13:56  enerel: without a at last
13:57  enerel: lol
13:57  JKarsrud: Trisox: Yeah, striping etc should be done in the callback :)
13:57  Trisox: mm
13:57  JKarsrud: unless you can do it with CSS :nth-child? :)
13:58  Trisox: woudl this update live?
13:58  Trisox: then
13:58  JKarsrud: Yeah, it should
13:58  pngl: Why is there no setClass function? Sometimes you just want to animate to a class regardless of the current state, and right now it is not possible. Or am I missing something?
13:58  nlogax: enerel: you are converting an html element into a string somewhere
13:58  nlogax: ?eval $("[object HTMLLIElement]")
13:58  bot-t: nlogax: []
13:58  nlogax: >: |
13:58  Trisox: nth-child doest do odd even right
13:58  JKarsrud: no, it doesn't add classes
13:58  JKarsrud: But
13:59  Trisox: ?:even
13:59  bot-t: :even: Selects even elements, zero-indexed. See also odd. http://api.jquery.com/even-selector/
13:59  Trisox: ?even()
13:59  enerel:       var linkClass = jQuery(this+" a").attr("class");     if(linkClass!="modalWrapW") e.stopPropagation();
13:59  bot-t: Trisox, :even Selector - Selects even elements, zero-indexed. See also odd. http://api.jquery.com/even-selector/
13:59  Trisox: i dont need classes .css() is fine
13:59  nlogax: enerel: `this` is most likely an element then
14:00  nlogax: enerel: so this.toString() + " a" becomes "[object HTMLLIElement] a"

14:01  enerel: thats why :not(.modalWrapW) was not working also
14:01  nlogax: enerel: $("a", this).blabla would find anchros elements inside that li element in `this`
14:01  nlogax: anchor even
14:01  enerel: oh great
14:02  enerel: thats what i want
14:02  nlogax: or $(this).find("a") of course
14:02  enerel: okay
14:03  Guest6719: hey there, if I have code like this: http://pastie.org/1325411 is there a way to use a wildcard selector in jquery? so I can just apply this to all fields with an id like chkAmountGuest* ?
14:04  nlogax: Guest6719: attribute selectors, like in css. [id^=chkAmountGuest]
14:04  WinegumS: I am back for 4th day ;), i have made example of problem ->  http://www.gaming-xtreme.co.uk/flip/example2/ of my code ( http://pastebin.com/jsUihATh ) maybe it make more sense to someone ?
14:04  sean`: BMCouto,
14:04  sean`: alive?
14:05  sean`: Trisox, it does :nth-child(even)
14:05  sean`: or odd
14:05  Trisox: oke :)
14:05  egrouse: lol a WinegumS
14:05  Trisox: but in the call back then
14:06  nlogax: WinegumS: aren't the elements just stacked on top of each other? blue covers red
14:06  Trisox: ?
14:07  Guest6719: wow, how did I get that guest name
14:07  Trisox: sean just like $("tr:nth-child(even)").css("background-color", "#bbbbff");

14:08  Guest6719: nlogax, does this work with $() ? I don't know it
14:08  nlogax: Guest6719: yes. $("[id...]")
14:08  Guest6719: nlogax, great, thanks a lot!
14:08  enerel: how to check it contains? linkClass = "modalWrapW mm-item-link cboxElement";    if(linkClass!="modalWrapW") e.stopPropagation();
14:08  Guest6719: nlogax, hm, one more thing, how would I iterate over them and reference the respective id then?
14:08  WinegumS: yes they are stacked on top of each other
14:08  nlogax: Guest6719: .each(function(el) { el.id })
14:08  Guest6719: nlogax, thanks :)
14:09  Cork: carpet_the_walls: .checked doesn't exist on $(), you need to use something like .is(':checked')
14:09  nlogax: Guest6719: o sorry, first arg is the index... second arg is the element, and it's also in `this`
14:09  Guest6719: ah, okay
14:09  Guest6719: I'll check
14:11  enerel: how to check it contains? linkClass = "modalWrapW mm-item-link cboxElement";    if(linkClass~="modalWrapW") e.stopPropagation(); is it correct?
14:11  carpet_the_walls: Cork: thanks, i tried .click and that had the same problem
14:12  Cork: enerel: if what contains the classes?
14:12  enerel: yes
14:12  Cork: enerel: if its a jquery selector use hasClass see ?.hasClass
14:12  bot-t: enerel, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
14:12  carpet_the_walls: Cork: click exists on $() doesn't it?
14:12  Guest6719: nlogax, ok one more thing sorry :) in my example above, I'm just iterating over all of them and appending it to the query - can I combine the above selector somehow with :checked?
14:12  enerel: they are classed
14:12  Cork: carpet_the_walls: the jquery function does ya
14:12  enerel: okay
14:13  kapowaz: is there some way of determining if a given element has a given attribute?
14:13  kapowaz: not attribute value, but actually has that attribute at all?
14:13  carpet_the_walls: Cork: ignore me, being thicj - thanks for help
14:13  Cork: ?attribute selector
14:13  bot-t: Cork, Has Attribute Selector [name] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute, with any value. http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
14:13  nlogax: Guest6719: yep, just add [id...]:checked  . i think you can also call serialize() on that object directly, instead of each(), to get the serialized value as it would be sent by a form

14:17  Guest6719: nlogax, hm thats nice.. so if I understand correctly I should be able to write it like this: http://pastie.org/1325411 is that right?
14:17  juha_: opera mobile has weird js engine
14:18  nlogax: Guest6719: was thinking data = $("[id^=chkAmountGuest]:checked").serialize()

14:18  nlogax: Guest6719: and since flag would be true if there's > 0 elements matched, you could just check .length instead
14:19  nlogax: Guest6719: http://pastie.org/1325447 so something like that maybe
14:20  Confused: hi  - i have a div with a background image which i want to slowly fade in/fade out in a loop - how should i approach that? Thanks
14:21  Guest6719: nlogax, hmm data is not empty before.. so I think it won't work, as its length can be nonzero but flag still not set

14:22  Guest6719: nlogax, or why is that
14:22  nlogax: Guest6719: no that's correct, you can declare/define vars like that

14:24  nlogax: sorry, i am not well-versed in bbq matters
14:24  lithi: how exactly do you want to loop and what is the loop binded to?
14:24  NET||abuse: ok, i'm not having luck with colorbox, what other popup iframe plugin would people recomend?
14:24  Confused: the loop should run once the page is loaded
14:25  lithi: and?
14:25  lithi: should it ever stop?
14:25  Confused: it's for a promotional item so it attracts the users attention - it's shouldn't stop
14:25  Confused: i imagine it slowly fadin/fadeout
14:25  lithi: oh right
14:25  enerel: guys whats wrong with this code? if(jQuery(linkClass+":not(.modalWrapW)")) e.stopPropagation();

15:07  KeeperOfTheSoul_: sean`: eg, if title contains the value; <h1>bob</h1> obviously those <> need escaping to &lt; &gt;
15:07  sean`: why
15:07  Kitu: ?eval parseInt("12px",8)
15:07  bot-t: Kitu: 10
15:07  Kitu: ?eval parseInt("12px",10)

15:07  KeeperOfTheSoul_: sean`: unless using $(..).text ('<h1>bob</h1>')
15:07  Kitu: thanks sean`
15:08  KeeperOfTheSoul_: sean`: because otherwise someone can inject random html in to your page?

15:17  aidan: oh, unless sean` has the answers, that's just as good :)
15:17  tristan_: aidan, not sure I follow.  the problem is fairly straightforward i thought, i just don't know the methods involved to do what i want.
15:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: here's an example of what I'm on about http://www.jsfiddle.net/gpnax/
15:18  aidan: tristan_: right, so break down the problem until you understand what methods might be involved
15:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: normally val would come from some json data
15:19  aidan: tristan_: to get the content of a node, .text(), to compare it to all of the other nodes you're going to need to substring, for building lists you're going to need .append, etc.
15:19  sean`: var foo = {}; var $li = $('li'); $li.each (function (i) { var $this = $li.eq (i); var match = /(foo|bar|baz)/i.exec ($this.text ()); if (foo[match[1]] === undefined) { foo[match[1]] = [];} foo[match[1]].push ($this); });

15:43  Hopsy: hmm
15:43  Hopsy: and space?
15:44  KeeperOfTheSoul_: probably, at the moment the space is handled by the regex backtracking after it matches :.. in the negative lookahead
15:44  KeeperOfTheSoul_: then the space is matched by the optional (?: :(..)) part

15:49  nail_: KeeperOfTheSoul_'s looks bulletproof
15:50  Hopsy: lol
15:50  KeeperOfTheSoul_: trouble is, the first part is greedy, so happly matches the " :en" part and thus the second capture doesn't see it
15:51  KeeperOfTheSoul_: and the second capture being optional means it doesn't backtrack to try and match it

16:41  pallet: sean`, it's not a CSS hack
16:42  sean`: pallet, that was the wrong url
16:42  Vorspire: SugaSlide, or you parse the function name from your dta-attribute and call it somewhere in a click-event binding
16:42  sean`: fuck this
16:42  sean`: I can't find the article
16:42  revolveweb: and yeas my bad compaq I thought you wanted to remove specific elements of the div, i misread your question so i'd just use .html

Any idea why?? I m interested in the Mobile version than the desktop version. Can someone help?
16:45  revolveweb: compaq depending on how much data is loaded on each page, you could make a .load call for the data you want to load, if there is minimal data you could just load it all at once
16:45  SugaSlide: so .data("something") is the same as .attr("data-something")?
16:45  SugaSlide: i heard rumours...
16:45  SugaSlide: didnt bother trying it yet
16:45  SugaSlide: lemme try
16:45  compaq: revolveweb, I will check out load.  but really I don't think the text loading will be issue, I think only images will
16:46  Vorspire: I like the data-attributes for development though, inspecting DOM etc, but I try to convert to $.data when complete

16:48  sean`: SugaSlide, it's nothing like that
16:48  sean`: they are completely different
16:48  SugaSlide: ye
16:48  sean`: however, youcan use .data ('name') to get the contents of data-name
