00:00  snollux: trying grab the php return value into a jQuery variable. $.get('createSalesRequest.php', $.merge(f1, f2), function(data) {alert("RID:" + data); return false;});
00:05  eTiger13: qom2: yes
00:05  rvdb: ok, off to bed
00:05  rvdb: thanks for the attention
00:06  Swimming_Bird: how does jquery evaluate javascript when loading it into an element?
00:06  eTiger13: Swimming_Bird: ajax-wise?
00:07  Swimming_Bird: eTiger13:  ya
00:07  eTiger13: snollux:  data is what you want in the line
00:07  eTiger13: Swimming_Bird: normally? it doesnt
00:07  Swimming_Bird: basically i have to manually use innerHTML because i'm loading in some special tags, and jquery strips it out
00:07  Swimming_Bird: but i'd like to have some js evaluated
00:07  eTiger13: ?getscript @ Swimming_Bird
00:07  bot-t: Swimming_Bird, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
00:07  snollux: eTiger13: in the line?
00:07  eTiger13: *that
00:08  Swimming_Bird: eTiger13: i was hoping not to make 2 ajax requests
00:08  Swimming_Bird: but i guess i cant
00:08  snollux: yeah, but what do you mean in that line.. where/how do I want it in that line?
00:08  eTiger13: function(data)   data is what you want right? thats whats being returned from the server
00:09  snollux: I want data, yes. I think that's what would be returned from my php script's "return" value
00:09  snollux: or so I thought
00:09  snollux: but data seems empty
00:10  eTiger13: snollux:  then your server isnt returning anything. what does firebug show?
00:13  petterr: Is there anythink like Tooltip? Eg. when hovering over object (<div>) small floating box with some relevant text will raise
00:13  petterr: anything*
00:14  peepz: ill go crazy soon.. why isnt this working in iE6!!
00:14  fostah: ie6 sucks!
00:14  eTiger13: theres lots of things like tooltip
00:14  snollux: ahah, eTiger13.. it gets all output, not only the "return"
00:15  snollux: wonder why
00:15  eTiger13: ?lmgtfy jquery tooltip plugin @ petterr
00:15  bot-t: petterr, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+tooltip+plugin
00:15  eTiger13: snollux:  what do you mean?
00:16  snollux: in my script I have echo statements, and those are getting called properly.. however, all I want (data) to have is the value that I send back with "return" in php
00:16  peepz: is there any other way I can make a post call beside using.ajax?
00:16  snollux: but maybe that can't be done
00:16  peepz: .ajax just does not work for me.
00:16  petterr: thx :-D
00:17  eTiger13: ?jquery.post @ peepz
00:17  bot-t: peepz, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
00:17  eTiger13: snollux: you lost me. what do you mean?
00:18  peepz: lets try it
00:20 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
00:24  peepz: http://pastebin.com/crhm2QF4
00:24  peepz: I am trying to use post. but im getting an error
00:24  peepz: and since the form submits I cant see the error code
00:25  eTiger13: peepz:  what are you hoping happens?
00:25  bakers: peepz: Throw a simplified mockup on jsfiddle
00:25  peepz: I want it to sen a post request
00:25  peepz: and get the resposne
00:25  eTiger13: peepz: your post is wrong. go back and look at the docs
00:26  Snerf: I am using $.ajax to load a page inside a div. how can I from that page loaded,  reload itself inside that div. I am trying to scroll through pages without having to reload the entire parents page
00:26 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:27  eTiger13: peepz:  fine, i'll do it: http://pastebin.com/gRq369zs
00:27  eTiger13: Snerf:  iframes
00:28  Snerf: can only do it with iframes?
00:28  eTiger13: Snerf:  thats the easiest way.
00:28  Snerf: well, I dont care about easy, I would rather not use an iframe
00:28  eTiger13: Snerf:  wait, are there scripts in the page? if not, then just load fragments ?jquery.load
00:29  eTiger13: ?jquery.load @ Snerf
00:29  bot-t: Snerf, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
00:29  Snerf: ok.. so run multiple jquery's.. gotcha
00:29  Snerf: makes sense.. thanks
00:31  peepz: works like a charm in FF but does not work in IE6
00:31  peepz: eTiger13:
00:31  peepz: thx for the help
00:31 --- friskd is now known as away
00:33  eTiger13: peepz: nothing works in IE6
00:33  bakers: IE6 barely works on its own
00:34  peepz: but this has to work in IE6..
00:34  peepz: so annoying.
00:34  Lumpio-: IE6 doesn't work
00:34  Lumpio-: I got scripts that crash IE6, you could use one of those
00:34  peepz: so basically dont built your site using jquery if ur going to use ie6
00:36  snover: peepz: What a remarkably ignorant statement
00:36  peepz: lol
00:36  brondsem: is there a special process for submitting possible security issues in jquery ui?
00:36 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
00:36  bakers: peepz: JQuery works fine with IE6... the limitations are IE not Jquery
00:37  coldhead: so basically dont expect sites to work if ur going to use ie6
00:37  bakers: Just like ANY design with IE6 it will take some tweaks
00:37  peepz: I cant believe I have to rebuilt this just because it oes not work.
00:37  bakers: html, css, js all need to be tested special for IE6
00:38  peepz: has anyone here ever used .ajax to post a form sucessfully in IE6?
00:39  qom2: what's wrong here:     $('.contenttext').remove('br');
00:39  qom2: doesn't work.
00:39  qom2: http://www.eddieahgren.se/#735017/Nytt-test
00:40  coldhead: peepz: we certainly have
00:40  coldhead: ?remove
00:40  bot-t: .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
00:41  coldhead: qom2: i think it would be more idiomatic to use $('.contenttext br').remove();
00:41  coldhead: unless that doesn't work either
00:42  qom2: yay
00:42  qom2: works
00:42  qom2: thanks
00:42  qom2: and thank you eTiger13, I solved it :)
00:42  parndt: are all dialogs sticking to the left hand side of the window in Chrome for anyone else?
00:42  parndt: jquery ui 1.8.5, jquery 1.4.3
00:42  qom2: but doing it this way, will there be some problems? like a longer loading time and what not?
00:42  coldhead: eTiger13 is a bit of a legend
00:43  snover: brondsem: I’m curious how a client-side library will have a security issue
00:43  brondsem: it could make XSS possible, in a way developers wouldn't expect
00:43  parndt: it sets left: 0px -- is there some other argument I now have to pass to make it center
00:44  snover: brondsem: which component is affected?
00:44  brondsem: dialog
00:44  snover: brondsem: Does it have to do with allowing arbitrary html in the title attribute?
00:44  parndt: (it's safari too, so all webkit)
00:45  snover: or in the closeText?
00:45  brondsem: snover: yea, related to title attr
00:45  snover: brondsem: jQuery UI doesn’t guarantee anything about data being escaped. In fact, it pretty much never escapes anything.
00:46  snover: brondsem: It’s the author’s responsibility to make sure that they are not passing arbitrary HTML :)
00:46  peepz: what is that tool where I can test my js online
00:47  snover: peepz: It’s called “a web browser”
00:47  eTiger13: ty coldhead . although i dont know if you mean a good legend or a bad one
00:48  eTiger13: parndt: are you sure its not just your code thats doing it?
00:48  addyosmani: peepz: perhaps you're thinking of jsFiddle or JSLint
00:48  parndt: eTiger13: that's what I'm currently looking into
00:48  peepz: jsFiddle, thanks!
00:48  addyosmani: no problem
00:48  eTiger13: jsfiddle.net @ peepz
00:48  coldhead: eTiger13: i'd use very different words if i meant a bad one
00:48  peepz: thx
00:49  eTiger13: different works like temp01 or coldhead
00:49  eTiger13: ...oh wait
00:49  parndt: doesn't happen on the demo so it must be something we're doing
00:50  eTiger13: parndt:  we as in you?
00:50  parndt: eTiger13: yes
00:50  eTiger13: cuz its not me
00:50  parndt: I wasn't saying it was you
00:51  eTiger13: you said we and i took we to include me since we is usually you and me and coldhead and eternicode
00:51  eTiger13: and whoever else
00:52  parndt: :)
00:58  LakWork: how can i determine if variable foo is wrapped with a jquery object?
00:59  snover: if jquery property exists
00:59  snover: or instanceof jQuery
00:59  LakWork: instanceOf, cool thanks
00:59  snover: no.
00:59  snover: instanceof.
00:59  LakWork: rgr
01:02  cangeceiro: trying to find a jquery plugin that i ran into a long time ago and cant think of what it was called, hoping someone here might know
01:03  cangeceiro: it was a plugin that would take a div full of images with varing aspect ratios and neatly arrange them on a page
01:06  Crash1hd: anyone know how I can make this work in IE $('#headerFlash object param[name=flashvars]');
01:07  eTiger13: wrap your flashvars with a single quote
01:07  Crash1hd: like this $('#headerFlash object param[name='flashvars']')
01:09  eTiger13: yes
01:09  Crash1hd: eTiger13, didnt work
01:09  eTiger13: if that even works
01:09  Crash1hd: I tried this too $('#headerFlash object param[name="flashvars"]')
01:11  ProLoser: does anyone know any good websites to hire someone?
01:11  parndt: eTiger13: turns out we had some CSS setting .ui-dialog { position: relative; }
01:11  parndt: I changed it to position: absolute
01:11  parndt: and it all works
01:12  parndt: incase you cared ;-)
01:12  eTiger13: parndt: i did since it was a we problem
01:12  eTiger13: Crash1hd: what are you trying to do?
01:13  qom2: does :first only apply to <li>'s?
01:13  qom2:     $('.contenttext br').remove(); - say you only want to remove the first br..
01:14  parndt: eTiger13: lol
01:14  eTiger13: qom2: no, it applies to anything
01:15  qom2: so,     $('.contenttext br:first').remove();
01:15  qom2: ?
01:16  pifantastic: qom2: yes
01:16  qom2: fantastic
01:16  eTiger13: ?tias @ qom2

01:17  qom2: and maybe lazy
01:17  qom2: thanks so much for your help
01:19  Crash1hd: eTiger13, I created a toggle that changes the flash file and xml files in the object (of course it works great in Firefox Chrome Safari just not IE of course)
01:19  ProLoser: anyone know of a site where i can hire someone?
01:20  eTiger13: ProLoser:  to do what? adult themed activities?
01:20  ProLoser: no
01:20  ProLoser: was that what you were hoping for?
01:21  ProLoser: damn, 'hire cakephp developer' gives me nothing but india results
01:22  eTiger13: only if you were a hot attractive female in the 18-45 range
01:22  ProLoser: that's a creepily large range
01:22  eTiger13: im in the middle of it, 27, about
01:22  ProLoser: looking for someone familiar with php and mvc frameworks
01:22  eTiger13: to do?

01:23  eTiger13: voluntourism? as in volunteer tourism? whats that?
01:23  Lumpio-: Voluntourism?

01:25  ProLoser: i couldn't say
01:25  ProLoser: it's between you and the employer, and i'm just searching for my replacement
01:25  ProLoser: so negotiable i suppose
01:25  eTiger13: im trying to download office for mac 2011 and its not working
01:26  eTiger13: well how much are you paid? range
01:26  Vorspire: ben_alman; url masking full working with BBQ :)
01:26  eTiger13: like 0-100k? or 100k-1m?
01:27  ProLoser: i would guess sub-100k
01:27  ProLoser: they had a consultant who was on for 100k i /think/ (completely unconfirmed) but that was at a consulting rate and he fucking failed
01:28  ProLoser: *100k+
01:29  parndt: so it's php for < 100k?
01:30  ProLoser: potentially, i honestly can't say the compensation cuz i don't know
01:30  ProLoser: it is a medium sized company
01:31  ProLoser: not a large development company
01:31  ProLoser: your job would be to develop their website/day-to-day application and then maintain it and improve it
01:33  eTiger13: ProLoser:  where at?
01:38  joeyreno: i'm trying to use fancybox on a site, but it keeps saying that .fancybox is not a function?  I've checked and rechecked that the right fancybox scripts are getting inserted and they are.  If someone has a quick second it would be greatly appreciated.. http://thebiketube.com/blog/cannondale-onbike
01:40  ajpiano: joeyreno, you're loading multiple copies of jquery
01:40  eTiger13: joeyreno:  you know you are including multiple jqueries right? 1.3.2 and 1.4x?
01:41  silo: joeyreno: Try jQuery.fancybox
01:42  ajpiano: perhaps fancybox is being loaded onto to the 1.3.2 , and then when another jquery gets loaded, it's obliterating the first...with all of the plugins loaded on to it
01:43  ajpiano: or somethign alnog those lines
01:43  joeyreno: ok, cool.  i see i'm loading jquery.min.js, but where is second copy?
01:45  eTiger13: joeyreno:  drupal is loading it. and then you are loading 1.4.3 from google
01:45  ajpiano: if you lookat the resources tab or whatnot, you'll see two copies of jquery.min.js
01:46  joeyreno: Ahh, ok, awesome, thanks a lot everyone.
01:46  eTiger13: joeyreno:  you should download yslow
01:46  eTiger13: i bet your site would get an F or close to it
01:47  joeyreno: eTiger13: ...yeah, probably.  i need to fine tune some stuff
01:47  ajpiano: joeyreno, fwiw, my plugins magically dispapearing cause i was loading jquery more than once was what drove me to #jquery for the first time, a few years ago :p
01:47  parndt: man that's a frustrating thing
01:48  joeyreno: ajpiano: haha, yeah, i've taken a similar route :)
01:48  parndt: surely jQuery could know whether it's already been loaded and not load agian?
01:49  parndt: again*
01:50  ajpiano: parndt: you can technically load multiple copies of jquery into a page
01:51  ajpiano: and noconflict them, have different versions
01:51  ajpiano: (i don't know why you really would want that, unless you were up shit's creek and it was your only paddle)
01:51  ajpiano: jqueryui checks for double laoding though
01:52  parndt: right

02:03  comhero: i'm new to jquery for things other than image rotators and other UI related things. Can someone point me in the right direction for making a call to a rest API and authenticating with HTTP Basic auth? (it matters not if the api key is exposed, in this particular case)
02:05  frioden: question...is there a jquery or javascript way to find what divs are visible in the browser window...not which ones have a visibility:hidden tag, but if the body tag is overflow:hidden, which tags are actually seen?

02:15  Crumbs: I have an image, then I have like 3 captions, and when user clicks the caption I want to swap the image for another image
02:16  eTiger13: Crumbs: $('#img').click(function() {  $('#imgArea').html ( $(this).clone() ); });
02:16  Crumbs: what is that? russian?
02:16  eTiger13: or you can change the image attribute of the main image
02:17  eTiger13: Crumbs:  if you dont know what that is you might not belong in here
02:17  Crumbs: thats why i want a plugin, so i dont have to learn chinese, ya know?
02:18  eTiger13: thats jquery/javascript
02:18  felixjet: could someone gimme a hand please? im using tipsy to create tooltips, my problem is that if i use tooltip="text" attribute, the validator say thats an error, but if i use title="", since its HTML, if the user have javascript disabled i dont want him to see the default yellow tooltip with lot of html tags and crap. what can i do?
02:18  Crumbs: i know that
02:18  eTiger13: if you cant handle that then you shouldnt be creating sites that have effects that require that. you should be hiring someone
02:18  Crumbs: no one wants to work for free unfortunately
02:19  eTiger13: felixjet: your tooltip probably shouldnt have a lot of markup in it. are you using xhtml strict? html4? html5?
02:20  eTiger13: Crumbs:  then you are going to have to learn it on your own if you cant afford to pay someone

02:20  cj: hey folks
02:20  felixjet: i think its a good html solution
02:20  cj: how can I get the string value of a dom element rendered to html?
02:21  eTiger13: felixjet: yeah. you can use something like that or data-tooltip="Text"
02:21  eTiger13: cj: what do you mean?
02:21  Lumpio-: The data syntax in "HTML5" is incredibly gay
02:21  cj: for $('<a/>').attr('href',v['href']).text(v['name']) I want <a href="moo">baah</a>
02:21  Lumpio-: I want XHTML and namespaces D:
02:21  Lumpio-: *proper* namespaces
02:21  felixjet: eTiger13 great, thx
02:22  cj: Lumpio-: I think you mean incredibly nigger-like, don't you?
02:22  cj: oh, right.  the word gay isn't like the word nigger
02:23 * cj considers the point made and puts the naughty words away
02:23  eTiger13: cj: what is the v['href'] stuff?
02:23  Lumpio-: ...wat
02:23  cj: eTiger13: assume v['name'] is "baah" and v['href'] is "moo"
02:25  cj: Lumpio-: I was attempting to give you a concrete example of why you should not refer to something as being "incredibly gay".  but perhaps the point was not made.
02:25  nullwire: if I set a variable, and do setTimeout(function(){}, 500); theres a chance my variable could change in 500 ms. how can I pass the variable to the function so it uses what it was at the start of the timeout?
02:25  Lumpio-: cj: Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt the feelings of the LBGTQ community or something?
02:25  cj: Lumpio-: yes.
02:25  Lumpio-: Political correctness is also gay.

02:27  Lumpio-: ¬_¬
02:27  RobW: 4t5y6klujtdyrhy
02:28  cj: Crash1hd: I'd suggest using firefox to view the object and see if you can get ahold of any of its properties
02:28  cj: s/firefox/firebug/
02:28  cj: Crash1hd: and then after you have some working FF code, see if it works on IE
02:28  eTiger13: nullwire: setTimeout function() { your variable; }, 500)
02:28  cj: and if it doesn't, try it on chrome and use its debugging tools
02:28  Crash1hd: cj well I can do this $("#headerFlash object param[name='flashvars']"); perfectly fine in firefox chrome just not IE returns undefind
02:28  eTiger13: cj: im still not clear what your question is
02:29  cj: eTiger13: I want to use $('<a/>') style dynamic element generation and then get a string representation

02:56  Tprice: lol one letter of jquery but thats not the point...
02:56  Lumpio-: ...just do it
02:58  eTiger13: whats it for?

03:26  eTiger13: call the flash() method again
03:28  Crash1hd: eTiger13, hmm the odd part is I tried this flashMovie = $('#flashHeader');flashMovie.flash({
03:28  Crash1hd: swf: 'assets/files/flash/viewFinderFlash/viewFinder.swf'}); and it adds another flash object below the current one
03:28  eTiger13: Crash1hd: remove the current movie and then call it

04:00  blackwhite: http://pastebin.com/WRZ1qbfM
04:00  blackwhite: I am trying to make an image swap
04:00  blackwhite: but nothing happe s
04:00  blackwhite: happens
04:01  rmurphey: blackwhite: why are you using 1.2.6?
04:01  rmurphey: also you may want to put it in a jsbin or jsfiddle if you can
04:02  srmaddox: how can i encode a JSON object to a string?
04:02  srmaddox: rather
04:02  srmaddox: well yeah
04:02  rmurphey: json2.js ?
04:02  snover: no jsbin! :|
04:02  rmurphey: oh sorry
04:02  rmurphey: didn't know we weren't using jsbin
04:03  blackwhite: http://jsbin.com/ocuqi3/edit
04:04  snover: rmurphey: it’s unmaintained
04:04  snover: jsfiddle is the place to be
04:04  blackwhite: oh ok
04:05  blackwhite: I will put it there then
04:05  rmurphey: sorry
04:05  rmurphey: blackwhite: if you can link to an actual working img src that would not suck :)
04:05  rmurphey: and though it's unrelated, i definnitely suggest you upgrade to something newer than 1.2.6
04:05  blackwhite: well I can put it up on my server
04:05  blackwhite: 2 secs
04:06  coldhead: is .replace a valid method for this.src ?
04:11  blackwhite: ok here goes rmurphey
04:11  blackwhite: http://000fff.org/uploads/test.html
04:14  rmurphey: blackwhite: when i view source i see some strange characters in the class attribute for the image
04:14  rmurphey: class="â€œimg-swapâ€"
04:14  blackwhite: hmm weird
04:14  vladikoff: blackwhite, nice domain
04:15  rmurphey: i think if you fix that it will work?
04:15  blackwhite: doh!
04:15  blackwhite: i found the problem
04:16  blackwhite: i had double ""
04:16  blackwhite: that is what gave the strange characters
04:16  blackwhite: it works now
04:16  iszak: hey rmurphey.
04:16  rmurphey: there you go :)
04:16  rmurphey: hi iszak
04:16  vladikoff: ih iszak
04:16  iszak: yay \o/
04:17  iszak: hey vladikoff.
04:17  rmurphey: temp01: i think bot-t should keep a scorecard
04:17  rmurphey: of problems solved in #jquery
04:19  rmurphey: blackwhite: you *may* want to consider switching classes on an element to switch images
04:19  imakewebthings: not to be a killjoy, but why are you using jquery to do this hover swap and not css, blackwhite
04:19  rmurphey: and use a single background image, positioned differently
04:19  imakewebthings: never mind, i'll just let rmurphey tell ya :P
04:19  rmurphey: haah
04:19  blackwhite: well
04:19  rmurphey: switching image src attribute can be problematic
04:19  blackwhite: i already did that www.blueskycouncil.com stack/this
04:19  rmurphey: in that there can be a delay
04:20  rmurphey: whereas if you just move a bg image with css there's no delay
04:20  blackwhite: but I want to be able to update an image once I have submitted a vote
04:20  blackwhite: and thought that if I first learned that part then I could do the next part
04:20  blackwhite: I have it so that it updates locally when I vote up
04:20  rmurphey: i would still consider doing it with classes if you can
04:20  blackwhite: I don't think that is possible
04:21  imakewebthings: what i think she means is
04:21  imakewebthings: using a background image and changing classes
04:21  imakewebthings: instead of an image tag with src
04:21  rmurphey: and have all of your possible states in a single bg image
04:21  rmurphey: and just slide the bg image around using css
04:21  blackwhite: but you can't make css conditional right?
04:22  blackwhite: i mean I want the image to be replaced once I submit the vote to the database
04:22  blackwhite: and remove the a href
04:22  blackwhite: that doesn't seem like something that you can do in CSS or am I wrong?
04:22  blackwhite: I am new to coding
04:23  blackwhite: but did this site myself and realised that I need some jquery to update things locally
04:25  letterpress: blackwhite: http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/
04:25  blackwhite: yeah but it's not just the image it's also the href that I need to remove
04:26  imakewebthings: you can use JS to do that when you submit the vote
04:26  blackwhite: k
04:26  imakewebthings: we're just saying you shouldn't use the js to swap images
04:26  blackwhite: ok
04:26  blackwhite: thnx
04:26  letterpress: why can't you make a composite image? with all the different states?
04:29  blackwhite: letterpress I can but the real reason to use jquery is because I need to remove some HTML
04:29  blackwhite: if you go to blueskycouncil.com and log in with stack/this
04:29  blackwhite: you will see what I mean
04:29  blackwhite: but I get what you are saying
04:30  blackwhite: rollover use CSS and then use jquerey to remove the a href reference
04:31  goosious: Is there a way to make a plugin that I can interact with like: $('.wrapper').note.get(...)    This way I could do note.get, note.put, note.show, etc... or is it best to just pack it all into the options?
04:33  rmurphey: goosious: you probably want to look at $.widget from jquery ui
04:33  rmurphey: and then you'd do $('.wrapper').note('get') or similar
04:33  rmurphey: goosious: here's a worthwhile writeup about it http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/
04:34  rmurphey: blackwhite: you don't necc need to remove the href reference
04:34  rmurphey: just preventDefault on click?
04:34  rmurphey: if you're talking about a link
04:34  goosious: rmurphey: Thanks I'll check that stuff out...
04:35  blackwhite: rmurphey hmm ok. Well I am using the link to update a database with karma points and then return the new value. What I want is to remove the href and exchange the picture with something else
04:36  blackwhite: that's that idea
04:36  blackwhite: but I think I need to do some more studying to understand a few things
04:36  imakewebthings: blackwhite: when you do the vote, add a class to the anchor, don't remove the href
04:36  imakewebthings: then on the click handler for the link, check for that class, and if its there just prevent default
04:36  rmurphey: and if you want to prevent future votes, just attach a click handler
04:36  rmurphey: right
04:36 * rmurphey defers to imakewebthings :)
04:36  imakewebthings: and in the CSS change the cursor so it isn't a hand, cursor:default;
04:37  imakewebthings: (just for that class)
04:37  blackwhite: k
04:40  rmurphey: blackwhite: bottom line is, generally you want to avoid having your js mess with attributes unless there's a good reason
04:40  rmurphey: most things can be done with classes or event handlers or some combination
04:40  blackwhite: got it
04:53  rpflo: rmurphey: love the example app from your jqcon talk :)
04:53  rmurphey: rpflo: thanks :)
04:53  rmurphey: did you see my little pubsub screencast?
04:54 * rmurphey wants to make a similar app with backbone
04:54  rpflo: saw the tweet, haven't watched it yet
04:54  rmurphey: only 9 minutes and 37 seconds!
04:54  rmurphey: or something
04:55  rmurphey: mostly i am pimping it because i have never made a screencast
04:55  rpflo: I've been using an extended pub/sub pattern in my mootools stuff http://github.com/rpflorence/mootools-channels
04:55  rpflo: <3 it
04:55  rmurphey: and i am rather amused by myself
04:55  rpflo: haha, I get excited about making them, then I get all bugged because I waste half my day on 10 minutes
04:55  rmurphey: next is one about requirejs
04:55  rmurphey: but that is going to take a lot more work
04:55  rmurphey: this one i did in two short takes
04:56  rmurphey: could have done it in one but i screwed up part of my demo with a stray comment
04:56  rpflo: I used to make training videos for a software company, you can tell how complicated something is when you try to record yourself preforming tasks with it
04:58  rmurphey: yeah, showing *how* to use something is hard
04:58  rmurphey: especially anything remotely complex
04:58  rmurphey: i feel like my little search app is a good one for demonstrating lots of stuff tho
04:58  rmurphey: and yet i feel like i need to disclaim it "don't ever write something this complicated for something this simple!"
05:00  rpflo: that's the really hard part about explaining heavy JavaScript applications, when you show the methods that decrease code and make the app sane, it's like 20x more code in the example
05:00  rpflo: "I swear, this is better"
05:01  rmurphey: yeah
05:01  rmurphey: look i turned your 10-line chain into 100 lines! amazing!
05:01  rpflo: hgahaha, exactly
05:02  rmurphey: i think the pubsub screencast/demo was good because the code footpritn didn't change much
05:02  rmurphey: just got broken up
05:02  rpflo: I'll have to check it out tonight
05:06  seancurtis: what really works for me is when people take an existing site and actually show how they made the changes and the thinking behind them
05:06  seancurtis: a year or two ago at Web Directions south someone was doing a talk on perf
05:06  seancurtis: and they took the actual WDS site and optimised it
05:06  seancurtis: and showed the perf gains in the waterfall
05:06  seancurtis: that kind of thing shows you the actual real world gains
05:07  seancurtis: sometimes you need to take something big and ugly and show how to make it small and nice
05:07  seancurtis: :)
05:07  rpflo: seancurtis: that's awesome
05:07  seancurtis: can't remember who did that perf session but considering the WDS site is already pretty damn good it was also proof that you can always squeeze more out
05:08  seancurtis: I think it ended up loading in about a third of the time
05:08  seancurtis: and pretty simple stuff too
05:08  devinrolsen: is there a built in feature of jquery to take a list of elements and reverse their markup order?
05:10  rpflo: devinrolsen: I hope not :P

05:45  jnylen: srmaddox: ahh, sorry. misread.
05:45  aaroninfidel: anyone know a good resource for event callbacks on the HTML5 Video element?
05:45  seancurtis: is there a toJSON method?
05:46  jnylen: in that case, john resig recommends http://json.org/json2.js
05:46  jnylen: then you would use JSON.stringify
05:46  jnylen: also see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191881
05:46  seancurtis: can't find it in api.jquery.com
05:46  jnylen: so.. anyone used templates?
05:47  srmaddox: stringify? hrtm
05:49  rmurphey: JSON.stringify has nothing to do with jquery
05:49  seancurtis: jnylen: have you given it a go before asking in here? :)
05:50  jnylen: seancurtis:  no, because I haven't written the backend code yet.  I was hoping someone might be able to review the syntax, since I've read that these things are hard to debug
05:50  jnylen: I like the concept though, I've hacked together several less-useful templating systems in the past
05:52  seancurtis: jnylen: it looks right
05:52  seancurtis: couldn't see any mention of {{each items}} on the jQuery page though
05:53  seancurtis: ah nm just saw it
05:53  jnylen: {{each}} tag sets $item and $index, items will be a data item
05:53  jnylen: I am mainly wondering if I can do ${$index % 2} and ${$item.user}
05:53  seancurtis: should it be {{each items}} or {{each item}} ?
05:54  jnylen: items is called Languages in their example, because it's a property of the data
05:54  jnylen: my data will have a property called items
05:54  seancurtis: ah k

06:55  as_df: so let's say I use a selector $('select'), and I take the first element $('select')[0]. why do I need to re-wrap this object in another $(...) to apply jquery functions back to it?
06:55  as_df: and is there a name for non-jquery javascript objects and "jquery'd" javascript objects?
06:55  snover: because it’s a dom element, not a jquery object.
06:56  as_df: oh hey and those are the names i was looking for
06:56  as_df: thanks
06:56  as_df: is there any design reason for having subscript return DOM elements instead of jquery objects?
06:58  as_df: or is the primary use of subscript just to get DOM elements out of jquery objects
06:59  snover: a jquery object is just a wrapper around dom elements.
06:59  snover: like an array with extra features.
06:59  as_df: ah, okay
06:59  snover: if you want to get a jquery object containing only a single element use .eq
07:00  snover: that’s what it is there for

10:14  imakewebthings: lol can you you just link us to a page?
10:14  imakewebthings: krz...
10:14  markj: thats what i was thinking, or a jsfiddle with the html
10:14  krz: no link
10:14  krz: im just trying to make this work with jquery
10:15  DukeDrake: though I never had that error ... what actually triggers document.ready?
10:15  philk: how can I register a callback with the jQuery datepicker that is called when the user selects a date?
10:16  markj: if you're including jquery before that script tag, I see no reason for anything not to work krz, what is in the body other than that script tag?
10:17  krz: markj: nothing else
10:17  markj: ?datepicker onSelect
10:17  bot-t: markj, UI/API/1.8/Datepicker - The jQuery UI Datepicker is a highly configurable plugin that adds datepicker functionality to your pages. You can customize the date format and language, restrict the selectable date ranges and ad... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker
10:17  krz: markj: other html stuff really
10:17  markj: philk look at the onSelect event
10:18  DukeDrake: i.e. will document.ready trigger if there's no "</body></html>"?
10:18  philk: markj: ah ok and then I can use inst.getDate to get the date object
10:18  markj: something is causing the document to never be ready like DukeDrake suggested
10:18  DukeDrake: or maybe the connection stays open for whatever reason
10:18  krz: yea DukeDrake has a point
10:18 --- CalebD_ is now known as CalebD
10:18  krz: i think document.ready triggers avter </html> no?
10:19  krz: avter=after
10:19  jetienne: console.assert(false); must trigger a message in javascript console, no ?
10:19  blackspotwiggins: DukeDrake, document.ready is triggered whenever DOM is ready for manipulation
10:19  DukeDrake: krz: I guess you could rule this out quite fast: does the page stop "loading" at some point?
10:19  blackspotwiggins: if you leave out </body></html> the browser adds them where it sees fit
10:19  krz: DukeDrake: yea it does
10:19  DukeDrake: blackspotwiggins: ah =)
10:20  blackspotwiggins: if you keep the connection open, document.ready still triggers (usually)
10:20  markj: you could solve this extremely quickly by just dumping the page online
10:20  blackspotwiggins: onload waits until everything is loaded
10:20  DukeDrake: blackspotwiggins: ah, cool
10:20  blackspotwiggins: until something times out ofc
10:21  DukeDrake: krz: create a seperate sample page then, with only the jquery file and the script in the body
10:21  DukeDrake: krz: are you sure the jquery file actually gets loaded? i.e. did you check in firebug?
10:21  krz: yeap
10:21  DukeDrake: blackspotwiggins: thanx... that's quite eye opening =)
10:22  srmaddox: Is there a way to get a rough idea of how complete an ajax request is?
10:22  blackspotwiggins: srmaddox, sure
10:22  blackspotwiggins: there are readystates
10:23  srmaddox: Yeah i saw that
10:23  krz: i think i know what the problem is
10:23  srmaddox: but im not sure how i might...access them regularly
10:23  imakewebthings: krz: do tell
10:23  srmaddox: on a timer or something
10:23  blackspotwiggins: you are doing long polling?
10:23  srmaddox: mmm?
10:23  krz: one sec. let me debug this first
10:23  blackspotwiggins: brb
10:24  srmaddox: Right now its just a simple $.ajax() request with an in-line complete: function to handle the response...
10:25  timing: is it possible to detect if a page is bookmarked? with javascript?
10:25  imakewebthings: i think in IE4
10:26  srmaddox: and, as inefficient as it might seem, im using a php script as middleware between facebook for retreval of all a user's friends - and the php just echos the new entries as it receives them, can take like 20 seconds for some requests
10:26  krz: i had a problem/error in my main js file that was stopping the normal process of loading everything
10:26  krz: seems to work now
10:28  DukeDrake: krz: yay for successful debugging =)
10:28  DukeDrake: next?
10:28  krz: how do i use jquery to rule the world?
10:29  blackspotwiggins: srmaddox, you want to get them incrementally?
10:29  owzzz: hi guys, I've got a container which holds 4 divs, When I hover over one of them I want it to expand and the other three I want to contract. how do I target all the div's excpet the one that's being expanded so that I can contract them?? my code for it so far is: http://pastebin.com/zJGa79tV
10:29  srmaddox: blackspotwiggins: the php script cycles through and handles the facebookapi, it just returns encoded json line by line one per friend
10:30  blackspotwiggins: srmaddox, cant you use fb api directly?
10:30  srmaddox: Sure
10:30  srmaddox: but the reason for not doing that is because JS is not secure for storing credentials, such as those needed to use the data to modify our database as we see it.
10:31  blackspotwiggins: ehh
10:31  blackspotwiggins: what?
10:31  srmaddox: You wouldnt connect to postgresql with a JS client.
10:31  blackspotwiggins: true
10:31  srmaddox: so all our logic is on our back-end php site
10:31  srmaddox: the JS is really just a UI
10:31  imakewebthings: owzzz: maybe theres a more efficient way but in the mouseover you can add
10:31  blackspotwiggins: well, you could use some form of comet
10:32  blackspotwiggins: to send data to browser as it arrives
10:32  srmaddox: comet?
10:32  blackspotwiggins: ?mdc comet
10:32  bot-t: blackspotwiggins, 2006-10-20 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Newsgroup_summaries/mozilla-dev-builds/2006-10-20
10:32  blackspotwiggins: hmm
10:32  blackspotwiggins: ?g comet
10:32  bot-t: blackspotwiggins, Comet - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet
10:32  dinosaadeh:  /join #c#
10:32  blackspotwiggins: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)
10:32  imakewebthings: $('#carouselContainer div').not(this).stop().animate( width 140);
10:33  srmaddox: interesting enough. But the question at hand is finding out a total bytes read so far from the ajax request.
10:34  blackspotwiggins: that i do not know
10:34  srmaddox: since the XMLHTTPRequest object really isnt even instantiated until complete.
10:34  blackspotwiggins: maybe parsing responsetext
10:34  owzzz: thanks Imake...
10:34  owzzz: I want it on hover
10:34  blackspotwiggins: anyway, comet is what you are looking for anyway
10:34  owzzz: so as you hover over each div they expand
10:34  blackspotwiggins: unless you enjoy inventing wheels or something
10:34  owzzz: whilst contracting the surrounding divs
10:35  srmaddox: Nothing invented, its not a push model
10:35  anli_: Is for (var i = 0; i < foo.length; i++) cross browser compatible or do I have to declare i before?
10:35  srmaddox: ajax requests do what we want. user clicks something, and the JS client requests teh data from our servers.
10:35  srmaddox: Seems logical.
10:35  blackspotwiggins: but you do want push
10:35  blackspotwiggins: or you return them one by one
10:36  imakewebthings: owzzz: ....yes
10:36  Birliban: hi, i cant get this to work, whats wrong with that? $('img.button').click(function() { $(this).attr('src', 'images/loader_small.gif').delay(8000).attr('src', 'images/time_delete.png'); });
10:36  anli_: Everyone should use $.post and stop having <form> tags on their webpages
10:36  blackspotwiggins: whichever works for you
10:36  DukeDrake: oh
10:36  doonie: sean`
10:36  DukeDrake: concerning server push ... there was a neat thing back in the days ... apache "nph"
10:36  anli_: hehe
10:36  anli_: In the cgi days
10:36 * doonie *knock knock* sean`, *knock knock* sean`, *knock knock* sean`
10:36  anli_: I was a C cgi coder back then
10:36  srmaddox: blackspot: no, technically, we'd like to just have the client say "give me my friends list" and our server sends it
10:37  srmaddox: but facebook API takes too long, so we want to give a loading bar
10:37  coldhead: those were the days huh
10:37  coldhead: good old C
10:37  DukeDrake: anli_: the technique seemed pretty neat ...
10:37  owzzz: do you suggest I use hover?
10:37  blackspotwiggins: srmaddox, then give an indeterminate loading bar
10:37  DukeDrake: but not sure which browsers would support this nowadays
10:37  anli_: Haha
10:38  anli_: nph is not something browsers will be aware of
10:38  imakewebthings: owzzz: yea you can, here is what i was saying http://pastebin.com/dJYaLyiu
10:38  anli_: Or cgi
10:38  anli_: Its on server level
10:38  krz: how do i check if element is in dom?
10:38  krz: length?
10:38  anli_: krz: yeah
10:39  DukeDrake: anli_: well .. ok ... I was referring to that mime type you would send in order to make the page reloadable on server push
10:40  imakewebthings: owzzz: i'll send you a fiddle in a second
10:40  owzzz: o.k cheers
10:41  owzzz: I will be logged off this now
10:41  anli_: jquery should have some mechanism to make text unselectable
10:43  imakewebthings: owzzz: huh? when i say send it i mean link it here
10:44  joeyreno: is it normal for a web ad to have a bootstrap.js that loads the jquery library?  Or is that really bad practice?
10:45  Birliban: Hi, this: $(this).attr('src', 'images/loader_small.gif').delay(2000).attr('src', 'images/time_delete.png'); doesn't work... anyone knows why?

10:49  blackspotwiggins: real classy coldhead
10:49  Tomashe: anyone got a sec to tell me what is the ptoblem since i defined slider())
10:49  blackspotwiggins: Tomashe, dont use string as an argument for settimeout
10:49  blackspotwiggins: that's extremely bad practice
10:49  Tomashe: ok so how shouldi do that
10:50  blackspotwiggins: pass a reference to function
10:50  philk: can I prevent the datepicker from putting the selected date in the associated input field? I would like the datepicker not update the field it is attached to but instead handle the selection of a date myyself in onSelect
10:50  Tomashe: hmm...?
10:50  blackspotwiggins: read the mdc link
10:50  blackspotwiggins: its the first example
10:50  Tomashe: are you talking to me
10:51  blackspotwiggins: ffs
10:51  blackspotwiggins: are you that thick?
10:51  blackspotwiggins: no, im talking to coldhead about the same topic you asked about
10:52  Tomashe: ok
10:53  Tomashe: works like a charm
10:53  Tomashe: ty mate
10:53  blackspotwiggins: next time make an effort to educate yourself
10:53  blackspotwiggins: as in read the links given to you
10:54  Tomashe: but
10:54  Tomashe: i need it to be a loop
10:56  ei2matrix: Hi guys, Im trying to parse a json response on my js but I can a way... normally I access to it as: response.key but now is multidimensional
10:56  Tomashe: blackspotwiggins: this function isnt good for me since its only delay my click
10:56  Tomashe: i need it to run it each X seconds
10:56  blackspotwiggins: so?
10:57  blackspotwiggins: it is run every 3 seconds
10:57  blackspotwiggins: or so
10:57  Tomashe: no
10:57  Tomashe: it runs 1 time then stops running
10:58  blackspotwiggins: settimeout is ran once
10:58  blackspotwiggins: interval indefinitely
10:58  imakewebthings: setInterval
10:58  Tomashe: ohh i c
10:59  Birliban: markj, setTimeout('$(this).attr(\'src\', \'images/loader_small.gif\')', 2000); doesn't work either... but also produces no error
10:59  Tomashe: ty guys!
10:59  Tomashe: perfect!
10:59  blackspotwiggins: Birliban, dont use string as an argument for settimeout o_o

11:00  Superman_: hi

11:00  blackspotwiggins: also, settimeout/interval runs everything in global scope
11:01  blackspotwiggins: zxiest, there are dom mutation events
11:01  blackspotwiggins: but you are probably doing things the wrong way if you need to use them

11:03  g0rd0n: is there a way to apply a class to all objects of a certain type? for example assign class "foo" on input:text fields?
11:03 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
11:03  zxiest: blackspotwiggins here's the thing... I'm loading ajax data in a span. Images that are small get removed automatically. If a div has all its images removed, it's removed as well.
11:03  imakewebthings: $('input[type=text]').addClass('foo');  ????
11:04 * g0rd0n feels very dumb now :(
11:04  zxiest: I need to know when the whole processing is done to see if there's anything left in my top span
11:04  blackspotwiggins: zxiest, what removes them, magic?
11:04  imakewebthings: er or god im bad with jQ syntax sometimes, but something like that
11:04  zxiest: blackspotwiggins nop.. events on images
11:04  blackspotwiggins: and who created those events?
11:04  zxiest: I did
11:05  blackspotwiggins: and you need events to see if events run?
11:05  blackspotwiggins: if you control everything you dont
11:05  zxiest: blackspotwiggins well there are onerror events as well. [Once everything is done] this is when I wanna execute more code
11:06  zxiest: I think it's impossible to "know" when everything is done
11:06  blackspotwiggins: that's like asking for an event for addition
11:06  blackspotwiggins: 3+2; event -> it's 5
11:06  blackspotwiggins: no shit it's five, i just did that
11:06  imakewebthings: zxiest:  there must be some part in the code where you remove the image, yes?
11:06  blackspotwiggins: james padolsey says it best, really
11:06  blackspotwiggins: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/questioning-non-ui-events/
11:06  zxiest: imakewebthings yes, and then events bubble to remove the divs etc
11:07  zxiest: if all images in it are removed
11:07  imakewebthings: zxiest: so why dont you just do whatever check you're trying to do then
11:07  zxiest: imakewebthings good point.. Let me check =)
11:08  imakewebthings: zxiest: what blackspotwiggins is trying to say, however tersely, is that since things only happen to the dom when you do them, you just make those checks..... when you do the thing that could trigger your condition
11:09  blackspotwiggins: yes
11:09  imakewebthings: if you need to do something when all the images go away, do a check whenever you remove an image
11:11  blackspotwiggins: terse is now my favourite adjective :)
11:13  imakewebthings: you're welcome :D
11:14  zxiest: imakewebthings thanks!
11:15  zxiest: I like this adjective :-)
11:15  zxiest: Yup.. there were a few places to fix and this spared me the timer lol

12:05  wild_oscar: markj: because the issue is not the validity of the element, but it's having html element text inside the script. sure enough: document type does not allow element "li" here --> legend += "<li>" $(this).text() + "</li>";

13:10  blackspotwiggins: i could also do $("a").attr("onclick", "rapepigs()");
13:10  blackspotwiggins: doesnt mean i should :P
13:11  seutje: hence the :D

13:13  blackspotwiggins: seutje, not really horricode
13:13  blackspotwiggins: it can be superuseful
13:13  blackspotwiggins: like $(something).parent_4()
13:13  blackspotwiggins: bad example, i know
13:13  doonie: ;P yez
13:14  seutje: u mean like $(something).parent(4)? :D
13:14  blackspotwiggins: or parententententent mentioned earlier
13:14  doonie: parents are dangerous when it would come to 'index'
13:14  doonie: since an empty space or something small can fux your code, and the next coder has no idea :) <3 closest/parents
13:15  seutje: blackspotwiggins: just saying, u could just make an arbitrary method that looks at the param instead of a secret method_missing method that would look at the missing method being used, no?
13:15  blackspotwiggins: yes
13:15  blackspotwiggins: sure
13:15  blackspotwiggins: the best example i know in ruby is for activerecord

13:21  philk: I have those $.ajax({ url: photo.path, dataType: 'text',  contentType: 'image/jpeg',  processData: false ...}); set but only the error callback is called because jquery parses the binary data
13:21  blackspotwiggins: sure
13:21  seutje: I just don't see the need to catch that in a overarching missing_method thing
13:21  blackspotwiggins: ruby is more readable + instantly understandable
13:22  seutje: if ur gonna call it, u prolly know if it exists or not
13:22  blackspotwiggins: if it's a remote resource through json, it might be there
13:23  blackspotwiggins: matter of taste i suppose :)
13:23  seutje: that's one of the few legitimate cases for try catch, innit?
13:23  seutje: just keep trying till it's there
13:24  seutje: actually, with json u can wait for the callback

13:27  IamTrying: How can i bring the jQuery library in this file (which is a opera browser js plugin) ? ex: http://gist.github.com/651155
13:28  seutje: blackspotwiggins: still sorta smells like a recipe for disaster
13:28  seutje: and it's slower than calling an existing method
13:28  blackspotwiggins: true
13:28  blackspotwiggins: so is try/catch
13:28  seutje: so it still seems more useful to me to make an arbitrary method and pass that a string
13:29  blackspotwiggins: then
13:29  blackspotwiggins: we could do
13:29  blackspotwiggins: .callmethod("methodname", arguments) for everything, no?
13:29  seutje: suppose
13:29  seutje: but I usually know the method is there and available
13:30  blackspotwiggins: or $(document.getElementById("something")).callmethod("show", 400)
13:30  blackspotwiggins: vs $("#something").show(400)
13:30  blackspotwiggins: that's the thing, you could do totally dynamic stuff
13:32  seutje: yeh, but u know when u need to, no?
13:32  philk: why does jquery always wants to parse ajax data?
13:32  seutje: I mean, if ur going to make a method dispensary, make a method dispensary
13:33  Cork: philk: depends what dataType you tell it to use
13:33  Cork: philk: if you tell it to use dataType: 'text' it won't

14:58  sean`: Confused, if you want them to be reinitialized, then you need to do $('select').empty ()
14:58  Northwoods: temp01: up ?
14:58  Northwoods: array or data attr
14:59  Northwoods: .data
14:59  Northwoods: ?
14:59  Hopsy: Confused: i am totally confused what do you want :P
14:59  Birliban: how to select the first td starting @ img <td></td><td><img></td> ?
14:59  Hopsy: :first
14:59  Hopsy: td
14:59  Hopsy: td :first
14:59  blackspotwiggins: $("img + td")
14:59  Hopsy: ?selector first
14:59  bot-t: Hopsy, :first Selector - http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
15:00  Northwoods: sean`: down ?
15:00  Hopsy: owh starting image
15:00  Northwoods: mekwall: up ?
15:00  Hopsy: td img :first :P
15:00  blackspotwiggins: heh
15:00  Birliban: ist not the first td in row, ist the fourth or so...
15:00  sean`: Northwoods, what?
15:00  blackspotwiggins: "td img" is not quite the same
15:00  Confused: sean - when you say reinitialized, do you mean emptied out? I want to restore the state of the selects based on what was saved to the database for that record
15:00  Hopsy: humm
15:00  Northwoods: var arr = new array(); arr[] = val ; ?
15:01  Hopsy: blackspotwiggins: should that not work?
15:01  Birliban: Hopsy, so i need the parent and the prev sibling
15:01  serio: var array = []
15:01  blackspotwiggins: because "td img" looks for images that have td as a parent
15:01  serio: new array() is for suckers.
15:01  blackspotwiggins: somewhere
15:01  blackspotwiggins: img + td looks for the first td after an img
15:01  blackspotwiggins: which is what i think Birliban asked
15:02  Northwoods: serio what is correct way to add checked boxes values in array
15:02  Hopsy: blackspotwiggins: so $("td + img") is not a for loop?
15:02  Northwoods: one after another
15:02  Hopsy: it stops when it found one?
15:02  blackspotwiggins: yes
15:02  blackspotwiggins: like the css selector
15:02  Hopsy: okay, learned something news
15:02  blackspotwiggins: if you have multiple <img>s after a <td>
15:02  Birliban: blackspotwiggins, no, i need the td before the td with the image...
15:02  blackspotwiggins: then it returns multiple
15:03  blackspotwiggins: Birliban, learn to phrase your questions better then..
15:03  crashev: if I have <span class="file">fileName</span> can I somehow select element with class=file and name=fileName or do I have to use .each() ?
15:03  Birliban: blackspotwiggins, as i wrote, i am
15:03  Hopsy: $("td + image").prev("td") ?
15:03  blackspotwiggins: $("td > img").prev()
15:04  Hopsy: and what is that blackspotwiggins ? :P
15:04  Hopsy: a bigger than symbole
15:04  blackspotwiggins: immediate child
15:04  blackspotwiggins: <td><img></td> matches "td > img"
15:05  Hopsy: is that also in a loop
15:05  Hopsy: not in a loop *
15:05  blackspotwiggins: what do you mean in a loop?
15:05  Hopsy: will it get all <td><img></td> ?
15:05  blackspotwiggins: if you have <td><img></td> <td><img></td>, it selects both images
15:05  Hopsy: or just the first one
15:05  blackspotwiggins: same with +
15:05  blackspotwiggins: sorry if i said that in a confusing way
15:06  blackspotwiggins: if you have <span>asd</span><img><img> them "span + img" selects the first one
15:06  Birliban: blackspotwiggins, you are right, sometimes it's hard to show what is meant exactly
15:06  blackspotwiggins: if you have <span>aa</span><img> <span><img></span><img>
15:06  blackspotwiggins: then span + img also selects both
15:07  Hopsy: owh yes, gotchyha
15:07  panfist: is it alright to pass 2D arrays to GET requests, like jQuery.get('/foo/url/', {bar: two_d_array}, function(blah) {...} ...); ?
15:07  Hopsy: blackspotwiggins: does this have a name :P
15:08  Birliban: blackspotwiggins, once again, i have row... in that some tds, in one td i a img and i want to select the td before the td with the image. in this case, $(this) is already the image tag.
15:08  blackspotwiggins: Birliban, as i said $("td > img").prev()
15:08  blackspotwiggins: or if you have the img
15:09  blackspotwiggins: $(this).closest("td").prev()
15:09  Birliban: blackspotwiggins, ok... thats what i was looking for. thanks!
15:10  Northwoods: sean`: if click one main checkbox ( check_all ) , rest of checkboxes are checked , what event happens on the rest of checkboxes , it is does not seem to be  CLICK   ?
15:11  blackspotwiggins: bleh, td > img part is wrong tho :(

15:37  ablomen: aleray, a lot of documentation frameworks are (pretty) code independent, you can use phpdoc javadoc or whatever doc you want for javascript without a problem
15:38  aleray: ablomen, do you recommend any in particular? I'm also going to build the doc for a python library...
15:38  ablomen: aleray, no, i don't like any of them ;)
15:39  aleray: ablomen, ahah. So you don't use any of them or do you have a custom script to do this?

15:50  bot-t: blackspotwiggins: moo
15:50  progrock: oh, ok.  I'm trying to figure out the best (performance wise) way to iterate over a list of objects
15:51  Danny_Joris: Hi all, I'm using slideToggle on some pages. This works good so far, but I have two blocks per page, where one of the two should be hidden (slideup?). When the click function is triggered, the hidden one should slide down and the other should slide up. Is there something to set a "slide state" ?
15:51  blackspotwiggins: probably no real difference
15:51  progrock: performance is extremely important since I'll be doing this iteration on mosue move
15:51  Bjornet: I have a jquery where I want to store the width of an elem. this should be ok: imgwidthNext = jQuery('img.imgvisualparams').width();
15:51  Northwoods: blackspotwiggins: http://pastebin.com/vfGZVyih , is this right way ?
15:51  Bjornet: Problem is that I get NULL in the console
15:51  Dykotomee: progrock: for (key in obj) { /* do stuff with obj[key] */ }
15:51  blackspotwiggins: progrock, maybe you should throttle it
15:52  blackspotwiggins: for in is probably the worst choice
15:52  Dykotomee: ?throttle
15:52  bot-t: Dykotomee, throttle | jQuery Plugins - With jQuery Message Queuing, you can process and manage operations on large queues of items or elements. You can throttle, giving each operation a little breathing room (firing tracking pixels, per... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/throttle
15:52  Dykotomee: Ooh that's cool.
15:52  progrock: Dykotomee: I;d have to do ob.hasOwnProperty as well.. which is too much
15:52  Bjornet: here is an extract from the query: http://jsfiddle.net/rAAfw/
15:52  blackspotwiggins: and he asked to iterate over list of objects, not object members
15:52  Dykotomee: Ah, yes.
15:53  Dykotomee: #1 reason why I did poorly on tests - not reading the question correctly.
15:53  progrock: blackspotwiggins: well, the jsut of objects could be an object or an array in this case
15:53  blackspotwiggins: $.each works eitherway
15:53  progrock: umm *s/jsut/list   dont know how I typed that
15:53  blackspotwiggins: actually use underscore each
15:53  blackspotwiggins: which delegates to native each
15:54  blackspotwiggins: but still, i recommend you not do that for every mousemove
15:54  progrock: I was gonna say, using jquery is probably bad idea in this case
15:54  Dykotomee: progrock: Oh, wait, I remember why I put obj - that way it could be either an array or an associative array (aka an object).
15:54  blackspotwiggins: maybe use timeout and/or the delta of movement
15:54  Dykotomee: progrock: But that still wouldn't work, of course.
15:54  progrock: blackspotwiggins: so.. to 'throttle' it, ar you saying liek do it every 5 times the mousemove is called... ro something likt hat?
15:55  blackspotwiggins: progrock, depending on what you are doing
15:55  blackspotwiggins: both time and space wise
15:55  blackspotwiggins: if you move mouse a lot in a very short time
15:55  blackspotwiggins: like across the screen
15:55  progrock: blackspotwiggins: wll to dumb it down, its a mosue trackign animation
15:55  blackspotwiggins: then it'd be silly to do that for every event
15:55  blackspotwiggins: something like 100 ms is quite ok delay
15:56  blackspotwiggins: or mayeb 75
15:56  blackspotwiggins: maybe*
15:56  progrock: blackspotwiggins: yeah, well I was changing the mouse position for every event.. but only animating (doign the calculations) ever 10 ms (when neeed, and stopping the nimating if mosue is still)
15:56  blackspotwiggins: a more clever way would be to detect when the mouse has stopped moving fast
15:56  blackspotwiggins: a la hoverintent
15:56  Danny_Joris: display:none; did the trick I think....
15:56  blackspotwiggins: also, if the mouse only moves < 10px, it might be unnecessary
15:57  triyo: I have a an iframe on my page and I'm trying to resize it to its contents height. I tried $("#myiframe").contents().height() and it works perfectly in firefox so far. However in chrome, it creates a very big white space at the end of the content thats not in the rendered iframe page.
15:57  progrock: blackspotwiggins: see, I'm trying to do minimummath in this fucntion each time the mouse moves (for performance reasons) so calculating whether its been 10 pizxels is probnably more that I'm doing to begin with
15:58  progrock: s/that/then
15:58  progrock: than*
15:58  blackspotwiggins: well, you'd check if you have to run the function in the first place

16:38  buddhamagnet: I am simply trying to iterate through and array of class and id names and append a paragrah to them
16:38  buddhamagnet: works in all save IE6 and IE7
16:38  buddhamagnet: code at http://gist.github.com/651456
16:39  danheberden: buddhamagnet: and you get the alerted error?
16:40  rvdb: hi
16:40  losing: buddhamagnet: you should use Drupal.behaviors instead of $(document).ready
16:40  rvdb: i've a question about jquery-ui-autocomplete
16:41  buddhamagnet: danheberden - nope, I get an uncaught exception that tells me that length is null or undefined
16:41  rvdb: by default, the current input value is passed on to a remote request as the 'term' parameter
16:41  losing: buddhamagnet: so it looks like the elements you are trying to access don't exist
16:41  rvdb: ...but this does not happen when constructing a source callback via ajax()
16:42  buddhamagnet: losing will using Drupal.behaviours resolve for IE7 - the code works in all other browsers inc IE8 and IE8 in compat moder
16:42  rvdb: how can I access the current input from within the ajax() source callback?
16:42  buddhamagnet: losing yep - on some pages they are there, hence the conditional - I only want to append if they are present in the DOM
16:42  buddhamagnet: losing - and thanks for your help
16:44  losing: buddhamagnet: Drupal.behaviors is Drupals implementation of document.ready, it gets called on document.ready and whenever an AHAH request changes the DOM.  It won't solve your current problem, its just a suggestion
16:44  buddhamagnet: losing and I appreciate it, will have a look
16:45  losing: buddhamagnet: is this jquery 1.2.6? Or are you running the jQuery Update module?
16:46  buddhamagnet: losing swapped it out for Drupal.behaviours, thanks for the tip
16:46  losing: np
16:47  Birliban: i have <td></td><td></td><td><img></td> $(this) is the image, iwant the first td. my solution $(this).parent().siblings().first() works, but is there a shorter way?

16:48  buddhamagnet: the jquery looks clean enough to me and works in Safari, Opera, FF, Chrome, IE8 and IE8 in compat mode

20:59  foucist: wolfman2000: take over how?
20:59  wolfman2000: ...bad phrasing
21:00  wolfman2000: Is the <a> element space completely covering <li>'s space?
21:00  foucist: like css wise? probably
21:00  foucist: i tried removing the css though
21:00  foucist: so its just html & js right now

21:02  bubbafoley: ah ok
21:02  bubbafoley: what if you select the <a> and then do preventDefault()
21:03  foucist: ok i'll at that

21:13  JamesGecko: yes.
21:14  temp01: then create a new form dynamically and do it
21:15  JamesGecko: that would work. thanks. :-)
21:16  temp01: you can do like, newform.append( $('.oldforms').find(':input').clone() );
21:16  bubbafoley: why not just make it one form?
21:17  JamesGecko: the original idea was to be able change a thing in each form and refresh the page to see the difference. but then when i jqueryized it, someone with javascript turned on didn't need to submit each form to the server to see the differences.
21:17  JamesGecko: i'm kinda bad at progressive enhancement, i guess.

21:25  Xenc: since there's only one, no need to use $.each
21:25  Xenc: or is that ok?
21:25  hdon: bubbafoley, care to elaborate? i'm interested in what plugins people are using and why :)

21:27  hdon: i am only interested in the client-side of the mvc framework. i want to implement the back-end myself because i have a unique back-end for which there are no mvc frameworks :)
21:27  bubbafoley: so just the views?
21:28  bubbafoley: controllers and models are generally on the server side
21:30  hdon: bubbafoley, yes i suppose that's all i want. a framework that can manage intermediate forms of models stored on a server, and issue updates to subscribers over some model-updated event, like a user interface element showing the details of an Employee
21:30  hdon: perhaps i should just craft my own

21:39  sean`: hi mheap
21:40  mheap: 'lo sean
21:40  sean`: oodavid, WRONG
21:40  freedgy: i.e. $('#parent').hover()... will trigger when parent's child is hovered over.
21:40  Neil__: mheap: 1.4.2
21:41  mheap: Neil__, then the code I shared should work fine :)
21:41  oodavid: as in: o = function () {}; o.foo = "bar";

21:41  Neil__: mheap: thanks, I'll give it a go. In the example I provided we had a closing tag for the <ul/> but yours wasn't - will that make a difference?
21:42  freedgy: mheap, you mean instead of hover()?
21:42  mheap: freedgy, I do

21:48 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
21:49  freedgy: Hey sean`. I am trying to apply a hover() function to a parent div, that is initially faded to 0.0. hover() brings it back up to 1.0. Works fine.. but the parent div has a child which is positioned outside the parent with css. Like a flyout tooltip. So even though hover() is only bound to the parent div, mousing over the child triggers it - which I don't want.
21:51  sean`: freedgy, event.stopPropagation ()
21:51  sean`: oh wiat
21:51  sean`: you want the child to not trigger
21:51  freedgy: yea
21:51  sean`: jQuery doesn' toffer that
21:51  sean`: you need to bind a native .addEventListener with useCapture == true
21:51  sean`: ?g seankoole.com usecapture
21:51  bot-t: sean`, addEventListener, the use of useCapture - Sean Koole - http://blog.seankoole.com/addeventlistener-explaining-usecapture

22:05  eTiger13: superflit: you mean jquery core right?

22:07  serio_: BBonifield, it's called progressive enhancement
22:07  serio_: fuck google's spec
22:07  eTiger13: Neil__:  for readability use a semi-colon to mark eol

22:20  timing: it shoukld not jump to end
22:20  timing: it should hold position
22:20  timing: like pause
22:20  timing: and then continue
22:20  timing: but the other way
22:22  bobbobbins: so i want to change the way a list is displayed by clicking a button...and then just adjusting the css...simple enough, but one view is a list view, and the next is a thumbnail view...how should i do that with images in one and not the other?
22:23  rpflo: Well crap, then it looks like i have to manuall do the calculations on this effect then :\
22:23  timing: rpflo: got it!
22:24  eTiger13: bobbobbins: show/hide?
22:24  timing: rpflo: http://jsfiddle.net/gqZL5/7/
22:24  timing: rpflo: it's a bit manual, but in a way a toggle
22:24  bobbobbins: eTiger13: so just already have the images there, but turn them on and off?
22:25  rpflo: timing: gross ... and thanks, that's what I was about to do, except I'd dynamically grab it's height
22:25  timing: rpflo: yeah the mootools variant looks better
22:26  eTiger13: bobbobbins: yeah
22:26  bobbobbins: thats what i was thinking...but i actually have 3 views...list, thumbnail and large image....should i swap out the image src to pop in the large images too?
22:26  Kindari|work: the difference is mootools apparently remembers the original height. jquery's method calculates height every time (or if not every time a bit more often.)
22:27  rpflo: Kindari|work: and you can tell a MooTools Fx instance what to do on link: cancel, ignore, chain
22:28  rpflo: Kindari|work: and the Fx.Slide is a completely different implementation, it actually wraps the original element so it's using scrollHeight

22:32  Aristata: hrm
22:33  rpflo: if you log $('#img')
22:33  Aristata: How do I get the img attributes out of that?
22:33  rpflo: you'll see it's the jQuery object
22:33  timing: rpflo: i tested it with slideUp and animate({height: 300});
22:34  rpflo: timing: thanks for the help, looks like you have to do some footwork no matter how you slice it
22:34  timing: sucks :-)
22:34  timing: rpflo: are you the main jsfiddle guy?
22:34  Kindari|work: i would stick original height in a data call so that you dont have the same issues and can still be dynamic.
22:34  rpflo: timing: no I'm a minor jsfiddle guy
22:35  Aristata: So that still does not help me, how can I get an attribute out of an HTMLImageElement

22:37  kanzie: How can I best test if the element is accordion or not to know whether to fire the destry()-function or now?
22:37  kanzie: not?
22:39  rpflo: Aristata: put it up on jsfiddle.net
22:39  rpflo: Aristata: but you're not wrapping the element, are you in an each loop?  If so you need to wrap it with $(this).attr
22:44  kanzie: anyone know how I can test if an element has acordion() set on it or not?
22:44  kanzie: to know whether I should call destroy
22:45  timing: check if there is a .ui-accordeon class on the element?
22:45  timing: but I don't know if that's an official method :-)
22:45  bubbafoley: that's what i would do
22:46  bubbafoley: .hasClass('ui-accordion')

22:53  serio_: "[16:53] <bot-t> No output. (Process Killed)"
22:53  serio_: hmm
22:54  aaroninfidel: temp01: jQuery Mobile is in alpha, and is still EXTREMELY buggy, definitely not ready for production use that's for sure. and I'm trying to keep my load time down to a minimum for mobile devices.
22:54  ajpiano: it sounds like you don't want to use jquery
22:54  snover: aaroninfidel: The amount of time you would need to spend patching jQuery to remove IE support could be better spent making your own code smaller
22:55  serio_: bot-t handles recursion better than I imagined
22:55  vladikoff: ?mlu @ serio
22:55  bot-t: serio, much like urself
22:55  temp01: did you are unimpressed?
22:55  danheberden: if you don't want to use jquery, just prefix all the commands with !
22:55 --- jeffszus_ is now known as jeffszusz
22:56  ajpiano: aaroninfidel: if you want to use jquery mobile as your mobile framework, but you are worried about the bandwidth cost of IE isupport within jquery itself, then maybe you shouldn't use jquery mobile
22:56  serio_: I did one of these to him:
22:56  serio_: ?eval for (i = 1; i > 0; i++) { alert( i ) }
22:56  bot-t: serio_: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798... (Process Killed)

22:56  bot-t: Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
22:56  serio_: well deserved
22:56  aaroninfidel: ajpiano: if I want to use jquery mobile then I shouldn't use jquery mobile? huh??
22:57  ajpiano: yes
22:57  ajpiano: if you want to use jquery mobile
22:57  ajpiano: but you're so concerned about bandwidth
22:57  ajpiano: that you think the problem is the fact that jquery provides support for IE
22:57  ajpiano: becuause it adds too much weight
22:57  rickard8: ls
22:57  rickard8: hm
22:57  ajpiano: then maybe you should consider a completely different framework altogether
22:58  aaroninfidel: ajpiano: well, honestly do you think jQuery (not mobile) is fine for use in the mobile arena?
22:58  ajpiano: it depends what you're trying to do
22:58  ajpiano: maybe you want to use zepto baby
22:58 * danheberden snickers
22:59  danheberden: the ie only code in jquery isn't really that significant
22:59  serio_: temp01, how does bot-t know when to kill a process, that's quite slick
22:59  temp01: serio_: it just does that after 2 or 3 seconds
22:59  temp01: it doesn't know shit
23:00  Putr: hi! I have a prlbem.. i get passed, from an event a event.target input field... i whant to append a <div> after it.. how would i go about doing that? i cant seem to figure it out
23:00  temp01: setTimeout(killProcess, ..); eval(...); clearTimeout(..)
23:00  temp01: psuedo code
23:01  eTiger13: temp01: i think bot-t is rather smart. i think its gaining knowledge and then one day will overthrow us all. it or you. not sure yet
23:02  sean`: aaroninfidel, don't be an idiot and remove IE only code
23:02  bot-t: I'm dumb.
23:02  sean`: LOL
23:02  serio_: I just assumed if I tried to throw bot-t through an endless loop that he'd just crash
23:02  serio_: :(
23:02  sean`: serio_, try
23:02  serio_: I was WRONG
23:02  serio_: sean`, I just did, like several times
23:02  sean`: ok
23:03  serio_: scroll up and you'll see where bot-t puked out a bunch of numbers
23:03  serio_: followed by (Process Killed)
23:03  sean`: you are evil
23:04  serio_: he took it like a champ

23:09  hdon: would there be any reason that a script element would not execute if loaded with .load()?
23:10  temp01: yes
23:10  temp01: you shouldn't load scripts using .load, it's not reliable
23:10  temp01: either use load's callback to run the code, or a separate $.getScript call
23:11  Soulhuntre: HEy all!
23:11  hdon: temp01, my coworkers were using .load() to load HTML with embedded script elements. i assumed it would work fine.
23:12  hdon: temp01, have you or any channel robots links to literature explaining why this is unwise?
23:12  Soulhuntre: Anyone here familiar with the jQueryUI dialog plugin? Under IE8 it is preventing the default key bindings when modal, in particular CTR-N
23:12  temp01: hdon: no, all I know is I've seen lots of users saying it doesn't work and there's a discussion about it on forums.jquery.com somewhere
23:12  hdon: temp01, thank you i will check it out
23:20  Soulhuntre: nyone here familiar with the jQueryUI dialog plugin? Under IE8 it is preventing the default key bindings when modal, in particular CTR-N
23:22  hdon: does jQuery have a property or method that will tell me the version?
23:25  zorph: how to check if an element exists?
23:25  zorph: if($("somediv") != "")

23:30  mshadle: could someone here help me with a jqmodal issue? for some reason some modals work but others don't and give me a $("#foo").jqm is not a function
23:30  zorph: oh, the size() method will help
23:32  delinquentme:  im trying to make this work :  $("#designTemplateButton","#templateMeta") .. obvs its NOT correct syntax .. so how cna i have two divs trigger the same event?
23:32  ajpiano: $("#designTemplateButton,#templateMeta")
23:33  Hoe``: what's that website about return false vs preventDefault?
23:34  Hoe``: ? return false
23:34  bot-t: 'return false' or call event.preventDefault() to prevent the browser's default action (such as navigation on a link) in an event callback. Example: $("#link").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); /* code here */ }) or $("#link").click(function(){ /* code here */; return false });
23:36  joshsmith: How can do an AJAX call every 30 seconds or so (for autosaving a draft)?
23:36  joshsmith: *How can I, rather
23:37  JKarsrud: Hoe``: Is this the one you're looking for? http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
23:37  Hoe``: josh: can you make a recursive timeoutEvent?
23:37  Hoe``: yes, thank you JKarsrud :)
23:37  JKarsrud: No probs dude
23:40  Hoe``: I'm bookmarking that, had to take a co-worker to school on it ;)

23:44 --- hacked1 is now known as hacked
23:44  JKarsrud: I'm really inconsistent on its usage myself, it all depends on my mood
23:45  JKarsrud: Even though I know I shouldn't be using return false in all cases, I usually do. But mostly in cases where I know it doesn't matter much
23:46  Hoe``: JKarsrud: I just made a js-link class that both forces a link to blue and does an e.preventDefault()
23:46  Hoe``: so that covers the majority of the times that I need it
23:47  JKarsrud: Yeah
23:47  sknight: this isn't a jquery question but instead an irc question- how do i respond directly to someone to help them with their question so that they get notified that i'm replying to them but the whole group can see my response?
23:48  ajpiano: sknight: you type their name in the beginning of their response
23:48  Hoe``: can't really both do a private message and a public one
23:48  ajpiano: anyone with half a brain has a highlight on their own nickname
23:48  Hoe``: you can do /notice Hoe`` check the channel
23:48  sknight: ajpiano like this?
23:48  ajpiano: yep
23:49  temp01: ?tab
23:49  bot-t: Use your tab key to complete nicknames in irc. For example, ben_<TAB> will complete to ben_alman: (or something similar). This little bit of magic makes IRC highlighting actually work!
23:49  sknight: cool.. sorry i was looking through the forums and i couldn't find anything.  thanks
23:49  ajpiano: temap02 like this?
23:49  Hoe``: I'm a big fan of Opera's irc client, for something where you'd expect poorly tacked on functionality, it's actually slick as could be
23:49  JKarsrud: Oohh, this theme in Colloquy even highlights when other users are highlighted. That's handy :)
23:49  Lumpio-: tempo1: it doesnt work
23:50  temp01: ?doesn't work2 @ Lumpio-
23:50  sknight: got it. thanks for that trick
23:50  bot-t: Lumpio-, What do you mean it doesn't work? I've tried it a thousand fucking times, it works fine!! Are you some kind of idiot? People have been doing this for years, and they've had no trouble doing it, so eat a dick.
23:50  JKarsrud: Lumpio-: It's a zero, not an "o"
23:50  Lumpio-: JKarsrud: ¬__¬
23:50  Hoe``: lumpi0-
23:50  Lumpio-: Yes?
23:51  Lumpio-: Speaking of l33tsp33k, I don't think my highlighter regexp handles that yet
23:51  sknight: JKarsrud: yeah, i'm using Colloquy.  it even beeps for you too so you don't have to keep watching the screen for a response
23:51  Lumpio-: Should probably add it.
23:51  JKarsrud: sknight: Meh, the sounds are annoying, I always turn them off when I install it
23:51  JKarsrud: The dock bouncing and growls are nice tho
23:52  JKarsrud: Just installed Colloquy on my brand new iMac that I god a mere 8 hours ago :D
23:52  sknight: JKarsrud: yeah, i customized it so that it only beeps when someone is responding to me

23:55  ravenzz: then i get data from google
23:55  ravenzz: youtube sorry
23:55  ravenzz: and try to fill that array
23:56  ravenzz: so now, the data is on the array but i cant use it ..
23:56  [KS]: let me guess, your alert(yd[3][1]) returns nothing... ?
23:56  ravenzz: uhm yes(?)
23:57  ravenzz: i got an error
23:57  [KS]: as you should already know, ajax is async
23:57  ravenzz: yd.3.1 is null or is not an object
23:57  Vorspire: [K] AJAX can be both async and sync
23:57  ravenzz: uhm
23:57  [KS]: yes well set async: false in $.ajax
23:57  tra: SJAX ;)
23:57  [KS]: and those returns in success and error in .ajax do not make a lot of sense tho
23:57  Vorspire: ravenzz, didn't we go through that async stuff the other day?
23:58  Vorspire: or was it someone else
23:58  [KS]: there's one every day :)
23:58  Vorspire: true true ^^
23:59  ravenzz: Vorspire uhm not
