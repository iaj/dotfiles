01:13 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 92 seconds
01:14  NET||abuse: so with jsonp,, my json data   {"foo":"bar"}  has to be wrapped as    bzr({"foo":"bar});
01:14  NET||abuse: so all static files output have to be formatted this way?
01:14  eTiger13: ajpiano: but not with 1.4.4
01:15 @ajpiano: 1.4.4 was released five minutes gao
01:15 @ajpiano: !!!!
01:15  eTiger13: and?
01:15  evantravers: Huh. You'd think there would be more people on then.
01:15  erichynds: lolz
01:15  eTiger13: when was 1.8.6 released?
01:15 @ajpiano: eTiger13: last week
01:15 @ajpiano: finalised two weeks ago
01:17  gnarf: NET||abuse: jsonp results are <scripts> that call a function defined usually with ?callback=jsonpfunc or something similar
01:17  eTiger13: ajpiano: no excuse. get that in there
01:17 @ajpiano: lol
01:35  jconrad: hi, i've got a jscript file which i've included in my html after <script type="text/javascript" src="static/jquery.js"></script> - however the javascript is working, the contents of the jscript file worked fine when i wrote it directly into the html file

02:11  Multi: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-show
02:11  janthony: Is there a way in jQuery to take an <li> and all the elements inside and set them to a str variable? i.e. if you click on an anchor inside the <li> and do .parent(), set that whole li to a var to be inserted into the dom at another place?
02:11  janthony: Or is it as somple as var myVar = $(this).parent();
02:12  janthony: I would think .parent() would only grab the element li, and not all the stuff inside
02:12  NET||abuse: hmm, am I well advised to try using jquery-jsonp  rather than .ajax jsonp requests?
02:14 --- rex1 is now known as rexx
02:17  snover: NET||abuse: no? why would you think that?
02:17  NET||abuse: not sure, someone suggested it was good.. why would you think it's not good?
02:18  NET||abuse: snover, one thing it seems to have is error handling,
02:19  NET||abuse: with normal .ajax method requests, it seems people have to work harder to deal witih timeouts and 404's, etc
02:19  snover: it does?
02:20  NET||abuse: snover, http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
02:21 @ajpiano: snover yeah
02:21 @ajpiano: jaubourg made jquery-jsonp
02:21 @ajpiano: to make jsonp better
02:21 @ajpiano: it's smarter
02:21  janthony: n/m, got it: var parentContent = '<li>' + $(this).parent().html() + '</li>';
02:21 @ajpiano: it got the borg inside
02:22  snover: shit, the borg
02:22  NET||abuse: that's pretty intereseting...
02:23  Multi: I'm having a lot of trouble finding the event for when a tab loads so I can rebind my events..
02:24  NET||abuse: hmm, ok, so i'm loading this widget.js file onto a remote site, i want to include that jquery.jsonp plugin, i created an anonymous function to contain my own version of jquery,,, but can i load the plugin just for my instance of the jquery object?
02:25 --- ezra-g|dine is now known as ezra-g
02:30  NET||abuse: so if i load jquery by injecting a script to and pointing to googleapi's jquery, how can i make sure the plugins i need only load after jquery is loaded?
02:31 * coldhead np don caballero - you drink a lot of coffee for a teenager
02:32  Multi: nvm I got it
02:35 @coldhead: NET||abuse: i think the plugins should work around that for you
02:35 @coldhead: use .ready or whatever
02:36 @coldhead: load order should be irrelephant
02:36 @coldhead: otherwise see also defer="defer"
02:36  NET||abuse: coldhead, well, what about if i'm loading my script onto 3rd party site, and i want to load a plugin like colorbox, what if they have color box already on their page,,
02:37  kenthree: I'm trying to string .animate .css and .animate, .css seems to happen immediately instead of being queued. Am I doing it wrong?
02:38  janthony: If I want to send over all the fields from a form, I would use .serializeArray() riht?
02:39 @coldhead: NET||abuse: in that case you should probably load a custom colorbox with a safe name
02:39 @coldhead: like $.__no_no_no_dad_that_game_hurts_colorbox()
02:39 @coldhead: and use that
02:39  NET||abuse: coldhead, right, just wondering,, how do i wrap plugins for use in a widget contexts.
02:42 @coldhead: NET||abuse: with document.ready() ?
02:42 @coldhead: i don't know, check out some widgets
02:42 @coldhead: or plugins
02:42  NET||abuse: coldhead, know any examples of widgets in the sense of 3rd party widgets we're talking about here?
02:43  NET||abuse: coldhead, so in your safenaming method, you have to change the plugin's code before you include the script tag?
02:43  Articate: $('input').change - what's the on and off equivilent?
02:44  Articate: for checkbox?
02:44  Articate: ..or, let me rephrase - is there a way to do two different functions on "on" and "off" on a checkbox?
02:44  NET||abuse: on change and detect the state of checkbox
02:45  xeen: this.checked
02:45  Articate: cheers
02:45  NET||abuse: http://api.jquery.com/change/
02:45  Articate: thanks :)
02:46  Rappy: Is there a way to reset/remove a loaded .css file?
02:47 @coldhead: NET||abuse: yes, i'd get a copy of colorbox and rename it to something obscure
02:48  NET||abuse: hmm, then re-minify it?
02:48 @coldhead: yup
02:48 @coldhead: blame JS for not having nice safe namespaces
02:54  jedmund: Hi guys, I'm trying to use this ajax uploader plugin: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/ and it uses document.getElementById() to grab the element to bind to
02:54  jedmund: y
02:54  jedmund: the problem is that I have elements that I'm creating in jQuery that I need to bind to, so I'd normally use something like live(), but I'm not sure how I can substitute that
02:55  jedmund: anyone have an idea?
02:55  Neiluj: Rappy: something like $('head').append($('link').detach())
02:55  Neiluj: will probably refresh every stylesheets
02:57  Neiluj: jedmund: you need to execute "new qq.FileUploader(...)" once your target is present
02:57  jedmund: so with a timeout or something?
02:58  jedmund: is there anyway for me to know for sure that I can execute it?
02:58  Neiluj: how do you create those elements?
02:58  Neiluj: ajax?
02:58  jedmund: they are being .load()'d in
02:58  Neiluj: ok, so use a callback
02:58  jedmund: ah, maybe as a callback
02:58  jedmund: sweet, that makes sense
02:58  jedmund: thanks :p
02:58  Neiluj: yw
03:02  jammur: Hi guys. I'm trying to use the $.post function, but it doesn't seem to be calling the callback function. It's posting the data, because it's getting inserted in the database on the server side, but even if I just put a simply alert() in the callback function, it doesn't get called. Any ideas?

03:10  NET||abuse: goddamn.
03:10  NET||abuse: ok
03:11  rexx: why should i use jquery over prototype?
03:12 @coldhead: because #jquery is a lot more fun
03:12 @coldhead: also i'd say jquery has a bigger community -- more plugins, more testing, more releases, wider support
03:12  tminos: rexx: because you don't have to patch jquery (even when using the latest release) to avoid major IE bugs & problems
03:12 @coldhead: hi5 tminos
03:13 @coldhead: because the latest version of jquery is about 2 hours hold
03:13 @coldhead: old*
03:13  tminos: I'm sure prototype has some good benefits, I just haven't found any. I have spent a LOT of time bashing my head on the wall because of it though.
03:14 @coldhead: if you're hardcore into prototypal inheritance and extending native objects, you might like how prototype works
03:14 @coldhead: but also you are weird and get away from me
03:21 @coldhead: HMM
03:21  Neiluj: somebody with IE7 available for a test? I think I found a bug with IE+Modernizer+$.html() ...
03:21 @coldhead: where to luncheon
03:21 @coldhead: yeah link us Neiluj
03:21 @coldhead: i <3 ie7
03:22 @coldhead: its my browser of choice
03:22  Neiluj: hehe
03:22  Neiluj: http://pastebin.com/H1kHEihp
03:22  Neiluj: you'll just need modernizer
03:23 @coldhead: this is not a test case >: |
03:23  Neiluj: not really ;)
03:23  Neiluj: the bug I saw was about IE not applying style to HTML5 tags when .html() is used
03:24  Neiluj: but it did with innerHTML...
03:24  Neiluj: coldhead: tell me where and how I can put this as a real test case please?
03:24 @coldhead: i'm already on it, bud
03:24  Neiluj: ok, thx
03:25  jammur: Is there any reason why a jquery function would run if I paste it in to the javascript console in the browser, but not if it get's called from a js file?
03:25  Neiluj: maybe your js file isn't loaded? :P
03:26  jammur: Neiluj: It's is loading. If I put a simple alert() in it gets called.
03:26  jammur: The $.post called doesn't get called though. However it does if I paste it in the console.
03:26  Neiluj: ok what are you waiting from this function?
03:26  Neiluj: did you think about $(document).ready(..) ?
03:26  jammur: Neiluj: That should have read $.post callback
03:28  jammur: Neiluj: The function is being called after I press a button. The DOM should be loaded by then correct?
03:28  Neiluj: jammur: what do you see in the network console?
03:28  Neiluj: right
03:28  Neiluj: do you see your POST request?
03:29  jammur: The $.post is completing because on the server side the posts data is getting into the database.

03:29  janthony: er, go through each field*

03:36  Neiluj: ok, but this bug exists, I'm not crazy and as I see it got a name :)
03:36 @coldhead: but no, its fixed in moderizr
03:36 @coldhead: so you shouldn't see it
03:36  miketaylr: modernizr includes the fix to the bug, as sir coldhead sez
03:36  Neiluj: do you know which version fixed it?
03:36  miketaylr: just use 1.6
03:36 @coldhead: 1.something
03:37  Neiluj: I wasn't using 0.9.5 last week..
03:37 @coldhead: haha
03:37  Neiluj: I'm curious about how they solve it :)

03:37  Neiluj: it does the job but...
03:37 @coldhead: yeah, ugly times, ugly measures
03:43  janthony: $('#createHeader :input').val(""); Is there a way to do this so it doesn't set the value of the submit button to empty?
03:43  Neiluj: janthony: what you want to do is a form.reset() ;-)
03:45  janthony: Neiluj: Hrm, no cigar: $('#createHeader').reset();
03:45  Neiluj: $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#createHeader').get(0).reset()
03:46  Neiluj: it's a "native" method
03:46  Neiluj: sorry $('#createHader').get(0).reset()
03:46  Neiluj: I suppose you're using a button to do this, why not using <input type="reset" value="Reset this form"/> ?
03:47  janthony: Neiluj: That worked! Thanks.
03:47  janthony: Because I'm using ajax to add records.

03:51  sroussey: Hi all, I'm looking for ideas on what is needed when debugging jQueryUI. I'm working on supporting jQuery like I do ExtJS in my extension for Firebug (see http://www.sroussey.com/article/2010/11/11/42724/Illumination if you are unfamiliar)
03:52  Articate: I was sort of viewing it as a child of the <form>, in which case it would make sense to look up for an id
03:52  Articate: the id would just be "thisform-cb" or something
03:52  sroussey: But it doesn't seem like there are many UI elements to even worry about..
03:54  Kronuz: hey, if I have a form's input, and modify its content… and I do theinput.html() … it doesn't reflect the updated "value"...
03:54  Kronuz: why?
03:54  Kronuz: :(
03:54  janthony: You can do $.ajax inside an .ajax success callback right?
03:55  patbam: hellews... is there a copy of jquery-tmpl on the code.jquery.com CDN somewhere?

04:01  Neiluj: It's probably you ask innerHTML on load, and not on change, I'll try

04:03  EspadaV8_W: http://jsfiddle.net/xcvSf/
04:03  Syk: ·.¸¸.·´¯`> xd
04:03  Phrogz_: I repeatedly do things wrong with $.extend, I think because it does things in a crazy unexpected way (for me).
04:03  EspadaV8_W: (although i have no idea hw to get anything to work on at site :-S)
04:04 @coldhead: I love you Phrogz_
04:04  Kronuz: Neiluj: you saw it?
04:04  EspadaV8_W: temp01: wouldn't surprise me
04:04  Neiluj: Kronuz: yes, I see it, hacking it
04:04  EspadaV8_W: that's jsut a really simple case I've found. holder.first._name should = 'bob' and y.first._name should = 'tags'
04:04  EspadaV8_W: although they both = 'bob'
04:05  EspadaV8_W: i'm assuming that $.extend is using a reference instead of a copy
04:05  EspadaV8_W: but so far, hacking at it I haven't managed to find out what's going on
04:05  Kronuz: http://jsfiddle.net/UYN9r/5/
04:06  Kronuz: I added a textarea, 'cause I need both
04:06  Kronuz: but at any rate neither the input nor the textarea return the innerHTML
04:06  temp01: EspadaV8_W: it should be this._name = 'tags' in the function
04:06  Kronuz: however, if I add another extra attribute to the inputs, it does shows (only not value)
04:06  EspadaV8_W: temp01: yeah, it should, but the issue is still there
04:07  EspadaV8_W: (sorry, i've been cutting back something i'm working on to try and get to the most basic example of it)
04:07  Neiluj: Kronuz: btw, why do you need to get back the innerHTML ?
04:08 --- snover is now known as snover|away
04:09  Kronuz: Neiluj:  well, I really don't, what I really really need is to copy the whole thing to somehwere else… it's like I have a form and I "open" part of the form in a dialog by copying it and opening a dialog with it, if in the dialog I press OK I copy back everything to the form (which is hidden) otherwise, I just discard the changes
04:09  Kronuz: (like editing a form in parts using a dialog
04:10  Kronuz: the dialog and all is working fine, but I found I can't set the value of inputs and textareas which are hidden
04:10  Kronuz: so I figured using innerHTML I could get it and replace it
04:10  Kronuz: …but now it's something else that's not working :(
04:11  Kronuz: (the innerHTML not getting the inputs and the textareas as the user edited them)
04:11  EspadaV8_W: temp01: any other ideas about what's happening?
04:11  temp01: it doesn't copy over your object created using new foo() because it's not a plain object
04:11  Neiluj: Kronuz: sorry but you're doing it wrong
04:11  temp01: it only copies plain objects and arrays in deep mode
04:12  EspadaV8_W: hmmm
04:12  Neiluj: when you say dialog, you mean popup?
04:12  Kronuz: yeah
04:12  Neiluj: like window.open() ?
04:12  Kronuz: like a UI dialog
04:12  Neiluj: ok, so not a real popup
04:12  Kronuz: no
04:12  EspadaV8_W: temp01: know of any fix? for either my code or jQuery
04:13  Neiluj: the best method I know : var $yourForm = $('#your-form').detach()
04:13  Neiluj: and $('#yourDialogBoxOrWhatEver').append($yourForm)
04:15  Kronuz: Neiluj: yeah, that part works fine
04:15  Kronuz: the part that takes back the dialog content's and puts it in the hidden div where the real form lives is the one that's failing
04:15  Kronuz: for the weirdest reason
04:16  Neiluj: Kronuz: "I found I can't set the value of inputs and textareas which are hidden" ???
04:16  Neiluj: what do you mean by hidden?
04:16  Neiluj: display: none?
04:16  Kronuz: yeah
04:16  Kronuz: in a div with display:none
04:16  Neiluj: mmh... weird, I can
04:16  Kronuz: :(
04:16  Kronuz: it's frustrating
04:16  Neiluj: which browser?
04:17  EspadaV8_W: temp01: ah, it's not that much work to convert it into a plain object

04:22  Kronuz: let me triple ckeck once more
04:22  Neiluj: the code I sent you??
04:22  Neiluj: O_O
04:22  Kronuz: yeah, the code is working

04:26  EspadaV8_W: needed a it of refactoring, but not too much :)
04:29  Kronuz: arrgh!!
04:29  Kronuz: Neiluj: it was that I was using html() as well in the part I copied from the form to my dialog
04:29  Neiluj:  hehehe :)
04:30  Kronuz: and it was being copied wrong, so I thought the OK event wasn't chaniging the hidden values
04:30  Kronuz: …a series of events that mislead me

04:53  Kronuz: :(
04:53  Kronuz: why!?? arrgh!!
04:53  iszak: because class selectors are often slow.
04:54  iszak: also learn about console.log.

04:58  Neiluj: Kronuz :  you're cloning
04:58  Kronuz: yeah, it seems it's a bug
04:58  Neiluj: inside your clone there are #id
04:58  Kronuz: with clone()
04:58  Neiluj: ids are unique
04:59  Neiluj: and you don't need to clone
04:59  Kronuz: but if I cancel the dialog?
04:59  Kronuz: I dont' want to get the edited values

05:03  Neiluj: hey, RTFM? :)
05:03  Neiluj: http://api.jquery.com/next/ ==>  .next( [ selector ] )
05:05  wesbos: Any idea how I can wrap all text starting from a strong tag and then right before the next strong?
05:07  Rappy: $('strong').css('color','white'); ?
05:07  wesbos: sorry i have some markup like this:
05:07  wesbos: STRONG TAG as title
05:08  wesbos: Text text tesxt
05:08  wesbos: some more text
05:08  wesbos: strong tag as title
05:08  wesbos: text text text
05:08  Neiluj: ahahaha :)
05:08  wesbos: I want to wrap all content between strong tags in a div
05:08  Neiluj: -> Regexp
05:09  Kronuz: Neiluj: got it working with no clone() …thanks for the tips :)
05:09  Phrogz_: wesbos: a) <strong> seems semantically weak, but whatever b) So walk on, brother.
05:09  Phrogz_: wesbos: By which I mean looping on nextSibling until you have it all.
05:09  wesbos: yeah, just working with the markup i ahve. its one of those situations
05:09  Neiluj: Kronuz: it can work with clone(), your problem was using id for your <input> and <textarea>
05:09  Kronuz: no, the problem is clone() doesn't clone textareas values
05:09  Kronuz: (it's a bug)
05:10  Phrogz_: Find the strong. Append a new div. while .nextSibling.tagName != 'STRONG' append to the div and update your pointer.
05:10  Neiluj: Kronuz: http://jsfiddle.net/UYN9r/14/ with Safari, the textarea value is cloned
05:11  wesbos: @phrogz_ wcould you start me off?
05:11  NiftyLettuce: any good HTML5 canvas Physics Engines out there? javascript phys engines?
05:11  Neiluj: Phrogz: I'm not sure jQuery will consider TextNodes as nodes with nextSibling() ?
05:11  Neiluj: will it?
05:12 * Phrogz_ looks around.
05:12  Phrogz_: Hell, I thought I was in ##javascript. :) Well, you know, walk using jQuery traversal :)
05:13  Neiluj: ;)
05:14  Neiluj: indeed ".nextSibling.tagName" and not .nextSibling() :P
05:14  wesbos: Let me throw up something on jsfiddle
05:17  wesbos: http://jsfiddle.net/pxWcC/
05:17  wesbos: So I need to wrap everything After the strong tag, and before the next one starts
05:18  Neiluj: oh if your text is inside <p> or any <tag> that's an easy one
05:19  wesbos: well it sometimes is
05:19  wesbos: wait somtimes the p stag starts before it

06:51  icek: Whats a good jquery framework for just overall website design, like cool buttons and cool pop ups etc
06:51  danheberden: icek, jqueryui
06:51  danheberden: and for website architecture, check out javascriptmvc
06:52  letterpress: thanks danheberden, but this hasn't been firing at image load. for instance $(".thumbnail img").load(function(){ ... }); doesn't fire...
06:52  letterpress: not sure why
06:53  danheberden: ?g detecting image load jquery
06:53  bot-t: danheberden, Simple image load detection with .load() - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/simple-image-load-detection-with-load

06:56  Third3ye: Hey :) How do I make it so that Jquery checks an input box for a character before it sends POST?
06:57  danheberden: Third3ye: before the form submits or before you do a post ajax request...
06:58  Third3ye: I really wanna start with ajax requests ^^;; but babysteps... so before form submit
06:58  Third3ye: like when entering in to the input
06:58  mdel: ?g .submit()
06:58  bot-t: mdel, Add your URL to Google - http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl
06:58  danheberden: mdel, no dot
06:58  mdel: ?g submit
06:58  bot-t: mdel, Add your URL to Google - http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl
06:58  danheberden: there ya go
06:58  danheberden: oh, lol
06:58  mdel: lol
06:58  danheberden: just submit
06:58  danheberden: ?submit
06:58  bot-t: .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
06:58  spope: join #svn
06:58  danheberden: like that
06:59  mdel: danheberden: keep that bot in line
06:59  danheberden: so Third3ye you can use the submit event to check your input
06:59  danheberden: so like $('#yourForm').submit(function(event) { ...
07:00  danheberden: event.preventDefault(); will stop the form from submitting
07:00  danheberden: and you can use the native submit function if you want it to actually submit.. this.submit();
07:00  mdel: if( validate(this) ) {  this.submit() }
07:00  mdel: validate being your own function, of course
07:01  mdel: remember to handle errors, perhaps with some shiny message or form highlight or whatever

07:09  danheberden: stooney - then get it like you would any other element
07:09  Third3ye: mdel: hmm :/ kind of stuck -- http://pastie.org/1291916
07:09  danheberden: does it have a name, or id?
07:09  stooney: both
07:09  danheberden: then use that
07:09  stooney: keep getting 'undefined'
07:09  danheberden: $('#idOfYourInput').val('new val')
07:10  stooney: that's what I thought, i'll check again for typos I guess
07:10  danheberden: ya, if it's in the dom - it's just like anything else
07:10  stooney: word
07:10  danheberden: it doesn't have a "i'm not part of the cool club" label or anything
07:10  danheberden: well, unless it's <label>I'm not part of the cool club<input /></label>
07:10  danheberden: then you're fucked
07:11  danheberden: Third3ye: what's this self shit?
07:11  danheberden: :p
07:11  danheberden: use this
07:11  Third3ye: ^^;;
07:11  stooney: <input type="hidden" name="clients_translate_upload_clientId" id="clients_translate_upload_clientId">
07:11  Third3ye: $(this)?
07:11  danheberden: in the case of calling the _native_ submit, you don't want a jquery object
07:11  danheberden: so just this.submit()
07:12  danheberden: you're calling the built-in submit function just javascript
07:12  danheberden: well, of the dom
07:12  stooney: $('#clients_translate_upload_clientId').val('wliefj') doesn't seem to change it's value
07:12  Third3ye: Woa
07:12  Third3ye: Over my head like the blue angels ^^;;
07:12  danheberden: that's one ID, brah
07:12  danheberden: Third3ye: you understand that 'this' is the form, ya?
07:12  danheberden: the actual form
07:12  Third3ye: Yeah :P
07:13  thom_logn: I'm binding a click function to an anchor element and want to make sure the click only executes my handler code and doesn't "click" the link. How do i do this?
07:13  stooney: ?
07:13  danheberden: so when you get this, it has some built-in, standard things
07:13  Third3ye: #msubm is the form's id
07:13  danheberden: and just like anything else, if you wrap it in $(this)
07:13  danheberden: you get a jquery object
07:13  danheberden: that CONTAINS 'this'
07:13  danheberden: that is, the form
07:13  danheberden: and that's all 'n good, for using jquery functions
07:14  danheberden: but the problem exists: if you call $(this).submit()
07:14  danheberden: that's gonna say "i submitted! look at me!!!" and the funciton you're in? the one that handles submits? it's gonna run again
07:14  danheberden: .... and again
07:14  danheberden: ........... and again
07:14  _bogus_: hey, how can i unfocus an element ? i mean , when i click an <a> element it keeps focused.. i wanted to unfocus it
07:14  Third3ye: hmm.. keep getting invalid... which means that it isn't searching for @ within a string, but that @ is the entire string
07:14  danheberden: now, you call the native one? the one that jquery cant hear? then you're golden
07:14  Third3ye: oo
07:15  Third3ye: So call form from dom and not jqueries specifications you mean?
07:15  Third3ye: from*
07:15  danheberden: ya, force it submit chuck norris style
07:16  Third3ye: You know, they say that the only time the internet went offline was when Chuck Norris punched his computer
07:16  Third3ye: :P
07:16  thom_logn: how do I get click handlers bound to anchors to make sure the anchor doesn't follow the link, just run the handler?
07:17  thom_logn: I recall it was like one line, I just forgot it
07:17  danheberden: thom_logn: in your event handler, say your event object is called 'event', e.g. .click(function(event) {...
07:17  danheberden: use event.preventDefault();
07:17  danheberden: to prevent the default action of following that anchor
07:18  thom_logn: mine just says .click(function()... Just add the event arg?
07:18  danheberden: ya
07:18  danheberden: it's always passed, just optional to use it or not
07:19  thom_logn: thanks
07:23  danheberden: coldhead, it's a quarter after one, i'm a little drunk, and i neeeeeeed you now

09:11  Agad3z_: Ie will load the whole page, but not the fragment
09:11  Agad3z_: Any help is appreciated :)

09:12  JenniferB2: hi folks.. how can I select checkboxes from a form that are checked
09:12  JenniferB2: ?
09:13  IceD^: e.g. http://foo.com/bar.html#foo will be send to server as http://foo.com/bar.html
09:13  IceD^: in any browser I know
09:13  Agad3z_: In firefox i can load the fragment of the page i want
09:13  IceD^: no
09:13  Agad3z_: just not in ie
09:13  IceD^: it loads the whole page
09:13  Agad3z_: hmmn ok
09:13  IceD^: _probably_ it does apply anchor to it
09:14  IceD^: but you can not and should not relay on this
09:14  jomofcw: Hello =).
09:14  Agad3z_: it actually is loading just the fragment
09:14  IceD^: it's impossible
09:14  IceD^: really impossible
09:15  IceD^: # is client-only side
09:15  IceD^: server is NOT aware of it
09:15  Agad3z_: .load("page.html");  vs .load("page.html #fragment")
09:16  IceD^: proper solution - modify server side - make separate requests available for each part you need
09:16  Agad3z_: ok cool, in the jquery documentation its says its possible: http://api.jquery.com/load/
09:16  Agad3z_: its been sending me xrazy
09:16  IceD^: if you are using good server-side framework/lang - it'll take just few mins
09:17  Agad3z_: ok using wordpress, i'm actually a web designer.. all of our devs quit... so its just me trying to figure this stuff out
09:17  IceD^: ahh
09:17  IceD^: it's not anchor
09:17  IceD^: it's just selector
09:17  IceD^: :)
09:17  Agad3z_: yeah thats right

09:20  IceD^: and also, personal advise, stop supporting IE - people using IE as browser are generally stupid and must be ignored
09:20  Agad3z_: i love jquery though
09:20  Agad3z_: haha.. yeah if only
09:20  Agad3z_: half the stuff i make is for ie users
09:21  IceD^: poor, poor Agad3z_
09:21 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
09:21  IceD^: for me - I ignore IE for past 5 years - no single complain from my customers
09:21  Agad3z_: jeez man
09:21  g0rd0n: ignoring ie is dumb
09:21  g0rd0n: sorry
09:22  IceD^: g0rd0n, why?
09:22  g0rd0n: ignoring ie6 - fine, but you cant ignore the rest
09:22  Agad3z_: yeah, i ignore ie6 for the most part
09:22  Agad3z_: but no way for the others
09:22 * RJD22 agrees with g0rd0n
09:22  g0rd0n: because it's the most used web browser in the world, and if you are a serious web designer, you will make sure your stuff runs at least on ie8
09:22  IceD^: it is not
09:22  IceD^: for an year already
09:22  RJD22: IceD^: please stop talking >.<
09:22  RJD22: cheack you facts
09:23  RJD22: check*
09:23  Agad3z_: basically one million people visit my site a month
09:23  RJD22: IE is the most used browser
09:23  Agad3z_: 500,000 are IE users
09:23  Agad3z_: I cannot ignore 500,000 users a month
09:23  Agad3z_: I would be fired
09:23  IceD^: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
09:23  RJD22: IceD^: those are highly unreliable
09:23  Jarda: IceD^: not reliabler
09:23  IceD^: w3c is not representative of course, but
09:23  g0rd0n: exactly, and ie8 is not so bad as ie's reputation is imho
09:23  IceD^: it's more-less accurate
09:24  Jarda: IceD^: it's actually not accurate at all
09:24  Jarda: they collect if rom w3schools, which is used mainly by web developers
09:24  RJD22: IceD^: they just check their own stats. and since almost only webdevelopers visit the site most likely most have FF
09:24  IceD^: is forum for brides accurate? if yes - it's almost the same, but just 18% ie
09:24  Agad3z_: So... is it true that .load("page.html #fragment"); is a bug in IE?
09:24  Jarda: that has nothing to do with normal end users
09:25  Husar: !help save div content to text file
09:25  RJD22: I have a entertainment site with 7 mill visitors a month. I get about 60 % IE and 40 % rest
09:25  Husar: ;d
09:25  Husar: Hello, can anyone show me example, how to save div content to txt file?
09:25  RJD22: even that number isn't accurate. but atleast more accurate than the ones of w3schoold
09:26  Husar: i find some example on google, but not working ;x
09:26  Jarda: in our app we have 88% firefox, but that is because we recommend it to our customers
09:26  RJD22: Husar: I'm sure you can't do that with jquery
09:26  IceD^: well, I'm not working for US - and in europe as I understand they got windows without IE bundled
09:26  RJD22: nor javascript
09:26  RJD22: IceD^: not true at all
09:27  RJD22: windows gets bundeled with IE in europe
09:27  Jarda: IceD^: doesn't matter at all. Because it's the first option people choose when installing windows...
09:27  Jarda: RJD22: yup, but it's not installed or activated by default
09:27  g0rd0n: i for once don't like firefox very much... i use it for developing because of firebug etc, but am more of a chrome guy
09:27  Jarda: you have to choose it on first run
09:27  IceD^: http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/06/windows-7-to-be-shipped-in-europe-sans-internet-explorer.ars
09:27  g0rd0n: but then again, if you are a serious developer, you make sure the site works on ie/ff/safari/chrome/opera
09:27  RJD22: g0rd0n: there is a firebug for chrome now isn't there?
09:28  Jarda: RJD22: it's not as powerful as the one from firefox
09:28  RJD22: ah ok
09:28  IceD^: testing in ff3, safari, chrome (different versions)
09:28  Jarda: and no firephp, that's a show stopper for me
09:28  RJD22: I use FF so I don't know about that :)
09:28  g0rd0n: yeah
09:28  IceD^: opera is not existent at all ;)
09:28  Jarda: IceD^: ok, I would never hire you
09:28  g0rd0n: i have to restart firefox several times a day, because it just eats too much memory and becomes slow
09:28 * RJD22 ignores IceD^ from now on
09:28  g0rd0n: hehe
09:28  Jarda: RJD22: cood call, me too
09:28  g0rd0n: yeah me too
09:29  RJD22: g0rd0n: yea I hope they fix the memory leak sometime soon T_T
09:29  Agad3z_: So... given that we have doubts about IceD^ competancey..is it true that .load("page.html #fragment"); is a bug in IE?
09:29  Agad3z_: hehe
09:29  g0rd0n: =)
09:30  philk_: anybody using paul irish's idle timer plugin? Once I have destroyed it, I can no longer reactivate it
09:30  g0rd0n: Agad3z_: i dont know, i just know that IE9 has some issues with jquery :)
09:31  Agad3z_: this is ie7 and 8
09:31  RJD22: Agad3z_: I never had any problems with using load that way in IE
09:31  RJD22: even IE6 did it correctly
09:32  Agad3z_: ok cool... man
09:32  Agad3z_: WHY ME??
09:32  Agad3z_: hehe
09:32  RJD22: no errors in firebug?
09:33  Agad3z_: Nope, it works like a dream in webkit and gecko
09:33  RJD22: doesn't IE throw js errors?
09:33  Agad3z_: ie does throw some errors
09:33  RJD22: I know that IE can be picky about comma's
09:34  Agad3z_: actually ie isn't throwing errors
09:35  Agad3z_: I'll try using some 's instead of "s
09:37  g0rd0n: Agad3z_: tried the javascript debugging in ie?
09:37  Jarda: http://jsfiddle.net/qepYq/
09:37  Jarda: works in my IE8
09:38  Agad3z_: Thanks Jarda
09:39  Agad3z_: The debugging in IE is the hazard symbol in the bottom left corner?
09:39  Rappy: I'm reading that .css() doesn't support 'border'... how would I change a border size and keep it the same color easily?
09:40  g0rd0n: Agad3z_: i dont know, i think you can open it with F12 if i am not mistaken
09:41  Agad3z_: Thank g0rd0n
09:41  Agad3z_: Yeah.. no errors in the console
09:42  g0rd0n: :(
09:42  Agad3z_: Tell me about it
09:42  Agad3z_: I'm about to punch the air
09:42  Agad3z_: in rage
09:44  Agad3z_: Ah well.. i can work around it..  if need be
09:44  Agad3z_: Thanks for your help guys
09:44  Agad3z_: I'M OFF TO DRINK BEER
09:50  threeb: is there a way to get the classes of an element? (names)
09:50 --- threeb is now known as babbos
09:51  doonie: ?mdc classname
09:51  bot-t: doonie, element.className - className gets and sets the value of the class attribute of the specified element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/dom/element.classname
09:52  babbos: cool, and how do i access the DOM properties of a jQ element?
09:52  doonie: ?get
09:52  bot-t: .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
09:52  babbos: you are very nice :)
09:53  doonie: that's what she said!
09:54  babbos: hmmm index doen't seem to be optional, is required...
09:54  doonie: do .get(0)
09:55  doonie: if you select just one element
09:57  babbos: i am getting a different .position().top value for an element on run time, after i have injected it in the DOM and afterwards when i query from the firebug console...
09:57  babbos: could it be that DOM doesn't catch up with the injection of html to calculate position property?
10:00  philk_: anybody using idle-timer from Paul Irish? After destroying the timer it cannot be reactivated it seems
10:05  jez9999: hi all
10:05  jez9999: im developing a jQuery plugin, and i want to store a set of options for each invocation of the plugin
10:05  jez9999: well actually, for each different element it is applied to
10:06  jez9999: so, if i did "$('.myDivs').myPlugin({a:'b',c:'d'});"
10:07  jez9999: say there were 3 'myDivs' elements, i'd be iterating through with an .each(); how can i store the passed options separately for each element (or what's the best way)
10:07  jez9999: ?
10:11  babbos: .data ?
10:11  jez9999: there's no way i can store it as an actual javascript var?
10:12  babbos: what do you want to store?
10:12  jez9999: options
10:12  babbos: options for what? be more specific
10:13  jez9999: for the element being customized, like which images to use
10:14  Rappy: $('.class').css({background: $('body').css('background-color'), border-top-color: $('#id').css('border-top-color')}); Is there something I am missing from my syntax here?
10:16  Darsain: borderTopColor
10:16  jez9999: anyone?
10:17  doonie: isn't borderTopColor js
10:17  Rappy: Darsain - Meh. I thought both worked.
10:17  Rappy: That did fix it though.
10:17  jez9999: borderTopColor is converted to border-top-color by jquery
10:17  Rappy: FF kept telling me I was missing the : after the property.
10:17  jez9999: as hyphens arent allowed in property names
10:18  doonie: not even when using it as a string?
10:18  jez9999: you're not using it as a string
10:18  jez9999: you're using it as a property name
10:18  timing: you can do .css('border-top-color')
10:18  doonie: good, that's what I asked :9
10:19  iaj: lo there
10:20  iaj: I got a request.. is there some way to create a jquery script that adds an onclick event to all radiobuttons from a certain form?
10:20  timing: you can ofcourse do: var top = 1337; color = 42; element.css({border-top-color: '#ccc'});
10:20  timing: but thjat won't make any sense
10:20  Rappy: So .css({background: $('body').css('background-color'), borderTopColor: $('#id').css('border-top-color')}) would be correct?
10:21  jez9999: yep
10:21  jez9999: i think
10:21  timing: iaj: $('form.certainForm input[type=radio]').click(function(){ /* your code here */ });
10:21  Rappy: .css('border-top-color') does work... just odd you can't use that when declaring the change.
10:21  jez9999: .css('border-top-color', 'xyz') is just passing multiple arguments to a function, not constructing an object
10:22  Rappy: Ahh, it's when the string is referring to an object that it's an issue.
10:22  pif: hi, are tooltips now included in jq-ui ?
10:22  jez9999: no, when it's being used as a property name
10:23  iaj: timing: thanks i'll try that one.. how can I access those fields... eg. I want to check whether the checked attribute is set or not?
10:24  timing: o use the change event
10:24  jez9999: of course, i dunno why they dont let you use - in property names.  they let you use $ in var names, ffs, which is annoying as hell
10:24  timing: iaj: with the is() method you can check for the checked attribute
10:24  iaj: timing: my javascript I wanted to use looks like that http://pastebin.com/biPFvjaq
10:25  iaj: eg. make radiobuttons toggleable.
10:26  timing: radio buttons toggleable?
10:26  iaj: is there any easy solution to that?
10:26  timing: shouldn't you use checkboxes then?
10:26  iaj: the problem is I need to use radiobuttons since typo3 plugin doesn't submit checkbox data
10:27  iaj: :\
10:27  timing: you know that checkboxes are not submitten if not checked right?
10:27  timing: submitted
10:27  iaj: yeah.. i know... but its the plugin that's causing trouble
10:27  iaj: but its working fine with radiobuttons
10:27  timing: fucking lame ass plugin then!
10:27  iaj: so I try to stick to those
10:28  iaj: timing: yeah.. correct :\
10:28  iaj: but is that accompishable by using jquery?
10:28  timing: did the typo3 guys confirm this issue?
10:28  timing: yeah
10:29  timing: you can get e.srcElement in the callback
10:29  iaj: timing: well basically its working - i don't know how much you are into typo - but if I create another page and make a "use content from" element there - selecting the plugin form... checkboxes are not working there
10:29  timing: and then do var obj = e.scrElement
10:29  daxroc: Morning
10:29  timing: then you can run that same code
10:29  phryk: Hi there
10:29  timing: iaj: I don't know typo3, but maybe there is a quick solution made by them
10:29  daxroc: Anyone seen a problem where you make a json request and it returns a response of failed to load source ?
10:29  iaj: so I'd simply put a var obj = e.srcElement and then radiotoggle(obj)  ?
10:29  phryk: I am in desperate need of help with a little problem that seems unsolvable to me.
10:30  timing: iaj: yeah
10:30  phryk: I need a function call to be delayed
10:30  iaj: timing: i searched a whole day not finding any answer
10:30  iaj: :\
10:30  timing: and don't forget to do: .change(function(e){ });
10:30  phryk: i did functioncall().delay(300)
10:30  phryk: and another functioncall after that
10:30  timing: iaj: see the 'e' as function param
10:30  phryk: which is never executed, and I don't get wh
10:30  phryk: y
10:30  iaj: the e is always set timing ?
10:30  timing: ieyes
10:31  timing: iaj: yes
10:31  timing: you can even remove the whole if statement in that function and do: obj.checked = !object.checked;
10:31  timing: it will inverse the value
10:31 --- jurica_ is now known as jurica
10:32  iaj: timing: ok.. so the jquery part is   obj = e.srcElemet;  radiotoggle(obj);   change(function(e){ });  ?
10:32  iaj: something is missing i guess :D
10:32  iaj: timing: ah thanks.. right.
10:34  doonie: I miss ctrl+q in windows ;\
10:35  ningia: can someone tell me if there's a way for accessing to an iframe content that have external src?
10:35  ablomen: ningia, it can't be done
10:35  ningia: ablomen: I thougth so... thanks for the confirm.
10:36  ningia: doonie: ctrl+w function sometimes... :)
10:36  Cork: ningia: if you ever succeeded with it, you would have found a security bug in the browser
10:36  doonie: it works mostly, but for windows/tabs :<
10:38  ningia: doonie: gnome-shortcuts addicted... :P
10:38  iaj: timing: is that the correct way of proceeding?? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/290338 - thanks :)
10:38  doonie: osx ;x just started to use it heh
10:38  mekwall: doonie!
10:39  doonie: mekkie ;D
10:40  iaj: timing: shouldn't the buttons get an onclick event as soon as I apply that code/
10:41  timing: ho gho ho !
10:41  timing: iaj: make it a change event instead of click
10:41  timing: and remove that change call, it doesn;t make sense

10:49  harshamv: Lumpio_: i am trying to integrate a ajax form submission into Cakephp framework.
10:49  iaj: timing: yeahh.. i fixed it now.. but I always get undefined does not exist.. so at least its calling my javascript function
10:49  iaj: just obj is wrong :\
10:50  harshamv: so i wanna learn how to make an ajax form submit
10:50  harshamv: then implement it there

10:55  HektoR: hello guys... can i simulate .change() ??
10:56  timing: iaj: and if you do e.target instead of e.srcElement ?
10:56  iaj: timing: sec trying
10:57  timing: iaj: I have to go in a few minutes, if you are still unable to fix it, make a jsfiddle at jsfiddle.net and ask the other guys here
10:57  timing: you are almost there :-)
10:57  iaj: thanks for your efforts timing, what's the best way of debugging jquery stuff?
11:00  HektoR: can anyone help ?
11:00  henrikkok: iaj:  Firebug, or the inspector in Chrome and Chrominium
11:00  timing: iaj: with console.log, just like you always debug javascript
11:01  ablomen: iaj, you can install the firequery plugin for firebug too, gives you a few extra jquery specific tools
11:01  ablomen: (for example, see bound events in the DOM view)
11:01  iaj: henrikkok, timing thanks... do you guys use chrome or fireefox btw?
11:01  timing: both
11:02  henrikkok: chrome and chrominium if working with html5
11:02  timing: what is chromINium?
11:02  timing: mine is called chromium i think
11:02  HektoR: can i simulate .change() ??
11:02  henrikkok: timing: i think im just misspelling it. http://www.chromium.org/
11:02  monkeynut: iaj, I find chrome to have a faster js engine but firefox to be more reliable
11:03  timing: henrikkok: haha I thought so already, but maybe it was a port or some sort
11:03  iaj: the only problem is that firefox got vimperator else I like chrome much more :\ in terms of speed stc.
11:03  monkeynut: HektoR: what do you mean by simulate .change() ?
11:03  henrikkok: :D - nah i just can't spell it.
11:03  monkeynut: HektoR: why not just *use* .change() ??
11:03  iaj: chormium... hmm never heard of it
11:04  monkeynut: iaj, have you tried chorizo?
11:04  HektoR: monkeynut: .change() doesn't work. :(
11:04  monkeynut: HektoR   ... it does! at least it does what it is supposed to!
11:05  iaj: monkeynut: what's chorizo?? got a link I only find dinner :)
11:05  monkeynut: HektoR: what is the effect you're trying to achieve?
11:05  monkeynut: iaj, that's the joke ;)
11:05  iaj: timing: target still doesn't work.. it doesn't give me an error message now.. but nothing changes with the radiobuttons
11:05  iaj: monkeynut: :p
11:05  monkeynut: ?change @ HektoR  ... is that what you want?
11:05  bot-t: monkeynut, Tutorial: How to Build an HTML5 Video Player | Steve Heffernan's Blog - http://blog.steveheffernan.com/2010/04/how-to-build-an-html5-video-player/
11:05  monkeynut: WTF??
11:06  monkeynut: sorry HektoR , I was trying to show you definition of change().  Change *only* fires onblur after the information has changed since last focus, is that what you want?
11:07  HektoR: monkeynut: i have two radio button. i bind .change() on them. but now i want to simulate change() at start of script and execute code what will be executed when i Really change radio button
11:07  iaj: timing: i just did an alert to show me the contents of e.target its: object HTMLInputElemet :(
11:07  monkeynut: HektoR: then you can select those elements and just call .change()  (empty brackets)
11:07  monkeynut: HektoR: that will fire off the event (if it has been bound!)
11:08  monkeynut: HektoR: if it's not working the events are not bound when you try to fire them off.
11:08  monkeynut: HektoR: post code! ;)
11:10  jetienne: FYI $.mobile.addResolutionBreakpoints (method) <- this method from http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/#docs/api/methods.html got a bogus example
11:11  monkeynut: are you *sure* jetienne ?
11:11  HektoR: monkeynut: thanks... i'm going to try now
11:11  jetienne: monkeynut: yes this is a double from the upper function. look at the end of the page
11:11  monkeynut: ok HektoR :)
11:12  jetienne: $.mobile.silentScroll(100); is not an example of $.mobile.addResolutionBreakpoints (method)
11:12  jetienne: to make it more obvious :)
11:14  iaj: can someone tell me how I can get the following fragment to work..   http://pastebin.com/GF3zbH9R
11:14  monkeynut: oh, I see jetienne , well spotted ... can you submit a bug report?
11:14  iaj: the e.target part seems to be wrong :\
11:14  JenniferB2: how can I query for attributes on a set.. i mean something like this: jQuery('input').find('[type=checkbox]')
11:14  HektoR: monkeynut: hah... it works... i just inserted change() after change event and it worked
11:14  monkeynut: iaj, what do you want to get from the error object?
11:14  HektoR: monkeynut: thank you very much :)
11:14  JenniferB2: i already have the jQuery('input') saved from earlier...
11:14  monkeynut: HektoR: glad to help ;)
11:15  iaj: monkeynut: well I want to bind the radiotoggle function to the specific radiobtuton (eg. it should get unchecked)

11:15  gls\Fr4NgUs: I need help
11:15  iaj: monkeynut: is it the errorobject?
11:15  monkeynut: iaj, gimme a sec to check your code first ;)

11:16  monkeynut: iaj, yes that is the error object
11:16  monkeynut: iaj, I think I can see what you're trying to do, gimme a sec
11:16  monkeynut: JenniferB2: yes
11:17  monkeynut: JenniferB2: be patient, we're working for free to help people as fast as possible, we're only human and no-one pays us anything to help.
11:17  iaj: monkeynut: thanks.. sorry im not so much into jq yet :\
11:17  gls\Fr4NgUs: Because for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
11:17  gls\Fr4NgUs: Now I will like that when I select another option from the menu that day also puts the price.
11:17  JenniferB2: i asked something earlier and never got an answer.. just wanted to check that I was logged in.. sometimes I can't write
11:18  monkeynut: JenniferB2: it would help if you could post code on pastebin, at least ask your question directly so people can answer it ;)
11:18  monkeynut: JenniferB2: all I saw was this "i already have the jQuery('input') saved from earlier..." which gives me nothing to respond to at all
11:19  JenniferB2: monkeynut: var inputs = jQuery('input') // Runs once only ... at a later time i want to be able to find inputs with certain attributes.. by using the variable inputs
11:19  henrikkok: JenniferB2: use the regular :checkbox selector - $('input:checkbox')
11:20  monkeynut: JenniferB2: the variable is populated at the time you run your query, it's contents will not be 'live' updated as your code evolves.
11:20  JenniferB2: monkeynut: what?
11:20  henrikkok: JenniferB2: or if you want a specific attribute you can use the $('input[attribute="value"]')
11:20  JenniferB2: monkeynut: javascript is object oriented
11:20  JenniferB2: and I haven't noticed that behaviour before
11:21  monkeynut: JenniferB2: so if at a later time you want only ones with certain attributes, you can either select again or if you want only certain attributes within what you have already selected, you need to do inputs.find('myspecialcase');
11:21  iaj: monkeynut: i think the e.target or e.getELemet is wrong :)
11:21  monkeynut: JenniferB2: I know JS has classes and methods, it's not true object oriented. I understand it very well. trust me.
11:22 * quicksilver laughs.
11:22  henrikkok: monkeynut: i don't believe you! :-)
11:22  quicksilver: "true" object oriented?
11:22  quicksilver: is that like "one true religion"?
11:23  quicksilver: There are lots of reasons to prefer prototype-based object systems to class ones.
11:23  monkeynut: quicksilver: he he ;) ... it's a rubbish geeky argument about programming paradigms, not getting into it ;)
11:24  JenniferB2: jQuery('inputs[type=checkbox]') works.. but can you do the same query in two queries ? jQuery('inputs').something('[type=checkbox]') ? it doesn't work with find
11:24  iaj: monkeynut: basically I want to assign to the obj variable the correspending (just changed) radiobutton
11:24  monkeynut: JenniferB2: ... we seem to have got derailed, you may have missed what I originally said which is.  if you have var inputs = $('inputs'), and at a later stage you want, say, checked inputs, then do inputs.find(':checked')
11:24  monkeynut: iaj, sorry, got side-tracked
11:24  quicksilver: filter, not find.
11:24  quicksilver: find looks for descendants.
11:24  monkeynut: iaj, e.target is correct, that will give you the element the event was fired for
11:25  JenniferB2: quicksilver: thanks!
11:25  JenniferB2: :)
11:25  iaj: monkeynut: np...   e.target.. gives me something strange I think
11:26  gls\Fr4NgUs:  Hello all, I have a problem http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/ Because for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
11:26  iaj: i did a alert(obj)  and its telling me object HTMLInputElement ... so somehow its correct but its not quite working yet
11:26  monkeynut: iaj, use console.log instead of alert boxes.  You can get better information about an object
11:27  monkeynut: iaj, yup, it looks correct to me, that's what I would expect
11:27  iaj: monkeynut: can you gimme an example
11:27  iaj: on what to enter?
11:27  iaj: on the console?
11:27  monkeynut: iaj, just:      console.log(obj)     in your code will do
11:27  monkeynut: iaj, I was just saying it's better than alert boxes, by the by
11:27  monkeynut: now, back to your problem
11:28  iaj: ooohh.. now I get it :)
11:28  monkeynut: iaj, what do you expect your code to do?
11:28  monkeynut: iaj, it will always have an object, so the if !obj will not fire
11:29  iaj: well... I want to be able to toggle the radiobuttons in my #kostenlosform
11:29  gls\Fr4NgUs: nobody know how can i resolve my problem ?
11:29  monkeynut: iaj, hang on, i'll be back
11:29  iaj: monkeynut: yeah but the obj.checked = !obj.checked doesn't seem to work
11:29  iaj: alright.
11:30  GoSox: im back
11:30  iaj: for example what can I do with the obj... obj.<> where could I find that out?
11:30  GoSox: so i have a problem, and i don't know how to debug it
11:30  jez9999: I'm developing a jQuery plugin, and i want to store a set of options for each different element it is applied to.  so, if i did "$('.myDivs').myPlugin({a:'b',c:'d'});" and say there were 3 'myDivs' elements, i'd be iterating through with an .each(); how can i store the passed options separately for each element (or what's the best way)?
11:30  GoSox: some of my A tags work fine, but some don't work at all
11:30  GoSox: you click, nothing happens
11:31  GoSox: nothing shows up in javascript console
11:31  GoSox: just... nothing
11:31  GoSox: i don't know where to go from here
11:34  henrikkok: GoSox: sounds strange - have you validated your DOM ?
11:35  GoSox: nnnnnnnno
11:35  GoSox: how would i do that
11:35  henrikkok: w3c webpage
11:36  gls\Fr4NgUs: Hello all, I have a problem http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/ Because for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
11:36  henrikkok: You can try a basic js call like: var e = document.getElementsByTagName('a'); for (i=0;i<.e.length;i++) console.log(e.innerText);
11:36  henrikkok: and see where it breaks
11:37  henrikkok: woops. e[i].innterText that is
11:37  henrikkok: damnit. innerText
11:37  GoSox: its kind of hard to use a validator because my issue takes place only when you are logged in, and then after you already click one object
11:38  monkeynut: iaj, i'm back, I might be having a silly morning, but i'm finding it hard to see exactly what you want to do!  as far as I understand, you want to create a new variable with the information you wanted.
11:38  chr: hi
11:38  henrikkok: GoSox: maybe the js solution can help then
11:38  chr: i need help on datepicker
11:38  chr: someone
11:38  monkeynut: iaj, does that make any sense?
11:39  monkeynut: chr, just ask your question
11:39  monkeynut: ?question
11:39  bot-t: monkeynut, question & answer | jQuery Plugins - SimpleFAQ makes visually pleasing and interactive lists of questions and answers. All questions are shown, with the answers hidden until the user clicks on the question. You can also add a search b... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/question-answer
11:39  monkeynut: ignore that ... still haven't got the hang of the damned bot :(
11:39  chr: how can select month whitout combo , direct in code
11:40  chr: with datepicker
11:41  monkeynut: iaj, check here http://pastebin.com/JWrMshcZ .... does this give what you want?
11:41  iaj: monkeynut: ahhhhhh... ok ill try it that way.. at first I wanted to have an onClick="radiotoggle(___.radiobuttonID)" to pass the button as the object to the radiotoggle function which should then watch - is the radiobutton checked - if yes uncheck it... else.. check it!   so basically I just want to have the possibility to en-/or disable the radiobuttons in a certain form - so I consulted #jquery
11:42  monkeynut: iaj, what you were doing before was a comparison!
11:42  iaj: huh?
11:42  iaj: :D
11:42  iaj: == would be a comparison?
11:42  iaj: oh..
11:42  iaj: it was ==?
11:42  monkeynut: iaj, yes but also != that means not equal to!
11:43  monkeynut: right, chr, you can find the <option> that has the month you want, and change it to have attribute 'selected'
11:44  crashev: im getting "too much recursion", is this some kind of bug in latest jquery releases ?
11:44  iaj: monkeynut: but it was obj.checked = !obj.checked which should have just toggled the values, no?
11:44  crashev: I didnt have this in older versions
11:45  chr: the combo month is obligatory ?
11:45  monkeynut: iaj, oh yeah, sorry.  it would if obj.checked was a property ;)
11:45  monkeynut: iaj, that's why you needed to do $(obj).attr( ... at least to keep it jqueryish ;)
11:46  iaj: hmmm monkeynut I set it accordingly to your instructions but it somehow seems to be broken anyhow
11:46  monkeynut: chr, i'm guessing you need to pick a month or it's kina ambiguous. I haven't used datepicker much but I know jquery well, can you post some code on pastebin?
11:47  monkeynut: chr, or even better a live demo?
11:48  monkeynut: iaj, you set as I wrote in pastebin?
11:48  iaj: yeah.. sec.
11:48  monkeynut: iaj, post your updated version
11:48  iaj: dunno why the webserver is so slow atm :\
11:48  monkeynut: iaj, first, check the braces match up, i'm too tired to check that ;)
11:49  iaj: monkeynut: i did that already (always use vim to insert code)
11:49  iaj: http://www.marcgalal.com/kooperation.php  that's the page for example - on the right side - theres the form
11:50  iaj: with 5 radiobuttons which SHOULD be affected - -well according to console.log they are.
11:50  iaj: but that's a strange behaviour if you try it out ツ
11:50  chr: ok i post an url in 2 minutes
11:51  iaj: monkeynut: they aren't even clickable atm :)
11:51  monkeynut: ok chr, also iaj, i'm going for a ciggy I will be back in 10 mins and I promise i'll get it working this time :P
11:51  monkeynut: (don't let that stop you asking others while i'm gone!)
11:51  iaj: thanks and enjoy
11:56  crashev: I've got: <input id="div_createdir_name" name="data[Dirs][name]" type="text" style="width: 195px;"/> and  $("#div_createdir_name").focus(); triggers an error: "too much recursion" - what is goin on ?
11:57  chr: http://cahors.3wcom.com/public/jm/date/
11:58  Cork: crashev: its something outside those lines make a pastebin see ?p
11:58  bot-t: crashev, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
12:00  monkeynut: ok iaj, i'm back, looking at your code
12:01  monkeynut: iaj, ok I think it's all clear now.  You want only one of those radio buttons to be selected at a given time?
12:01  doonie: anyone have any exp. with using a spreadshirt store? any good/bad remarks on it?
12:02  monkeynut: iaj, do you *have* to do this with javascript? radio buttons should automatically only have one selected, but a set of radio buttons where only one should be selected should all have the same name
12:03  Yannix: how can i pass a global js variable inside jquery callback function ?
12:03  crashev: Cork: its a very big code, hard to tell what to paste
12:03  monkeynut: Yannix: if it's global you don't need to pass it
12:03  monkeynut: Yannix: if it's global, just use it like a local variable
12:03  Husar: How can i get current height this div: <div id="live" style="width: 700px; height: 540px; overflow: auto;"></div> ??
12:03  Cork: ?jslint @ crashev
12:03  bot-t: crashev, JSLint, The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
12:04  Husar: $('#live').height(); always return 540...
12:04  monkeynut: does that make sense?  inside callback   myfunction(myglobal);
12:04  Yannix: monkeynut: in this way it don't run
12:04  monkeynut: Yannix: it should, can you put some code in pastebin or show live link?
12:04  timing: 11:07:37 < iaj> timing: i just did an alert to show me the contents of e.target its: object HTMLInputElemet :(
12:04  Cork: Husar: put the content of the div in another div, and grab its height
12:04  timing: that's good
12:05  crashev: Cork: can I paste whole html into this or just only code between <script> tags ?
12:05  Cork: crashev: just the js code
12:05  monkeynut: timing, his site is here. http://www.marcgalal.com/kooperation.php he doesn't need js, he needs to set the name properties properly ;)
12:06  Cork: crashev: it will validate that your js has a sain ctructure
12:06  Cork: *structure
12:06  chr: sorry new code : http://cahors.3wcom.com/public/jm/date/
12:06  Husar: Second: How can i take 'true' if srollbar is actualy on bottom?
12:06  timing: monkeynut: lol haha
12:07  Yannix: monkeynut: http://yannix.pastebin.com/LEVzjvtg
12:07  timing: monkeynut: what happend to that gray old man? his face looks photoshopped
12:07  monkeynut: iaj, I think there is a design problem, if you have to hack it, in the callback set all the boxes who are not the current one to be .attr('checked', false);
12:08  monkeynut: lol @ timing
12:08  monkeynut: Yannix: checking now
12:08  Yannix: monkeynut: thank
12:08  ruby_on_tails: hi
12:08  ruby_on_tails: can .load() fetch content of a foreign php page ?
12:08  ruby_on_tails: foreign means some other domain's
12:09  monkeynut: Yannix, is that all the code or just a small section of it?
12:09  monkeynut: Yannix: only problem I see there is you have missed two ';'  ... but I think in this case it should still work.
12:10  Yannix: just a section where they are issue
12:10  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: that will violate security mechanisms of most browsers
12:10  ruby_on_tails: hmm
12:10  iaj: monkeynut: nahhh it should be like that I basically want to replace checkboxes by radiobutton (because of a failure of the plugin)
12:10  monkeynut: Yannix: If adding in the ';' at the end of the alert lines doesn't magically fix it, you'll have to post the complete problem code
12:10  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: how ?
12:10  iaj: that's y i need multiple items to be checkable (and uncheckable)
12:10  monkeynut: iaj, I see, in that case you have to use the other suggestion above
12:11  Yannix: monkeynut: ok
12:11  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: the only way I know is to use a hidden iframe to load the contents, it's just a bit more of a hastle but should work
12:11  iaj: monkeynut: which one do you mean.. .attr('checked',false) setting to all the others is NOT what I want :(
12:12  iaj: I just want to be able to deselect a radiobutton if one accidently checked it
12:12  iaj: eg use radiobuttons as checkboxes :D
12:12  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: you can dynamically create the iframe and set the src attrubute. use the iframe's onload function to get a callback
12:12  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: i mean how ould it cause security problems ?
12:12  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: hmm
12:13  monkeynut: iaj, I understand now.  so, you do want to hack it :P
12:13  iaj: monkeynut: yeah
12:13  iaj: :-D
12:13  chr: more precision on my question : i would like calendar datepicker on a month by command, whitout date selected
12:13  iaj: I could achieve the original radiobutton behaviour with no problem - I intentionally created 5 different radiobutton names there ( so that there can be multiple checks ) 
12:14  Yannix: monkeynut: thank's for your help, i have fixit
12:14  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: the problem is i have a flash animation that loads some image. i have to load this flash animation on some other page and not the url breaks.(i have to load the animation on same domain but still the iamges in the animation dont work)
12:14  monkeynut: iaj $('input[type=radio]').click( function() { if ( $(this).is(':checked') ) $(this).attr('checked',false); } );
12:14  gls\Fr4NgUs:  Hello all, I have a problem http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/ Because for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
12:14  monkeynut: iaj, i'm sure you can add the second if in there. that way will be foolproof ;)
12:15  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHH FFFFFLAAAAAAAAASSSSSHHHH :(
12:15  ruby_on_tails: cant helpppppppppppppppppppppppppppp:(
12:15  ruby_on_tails: its a branding engine
12:15  ruby_on_tails: jquery cant do it :(
12:15  ruby_on_tails: like micro-mini photoshop
12:16  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: awwww ... do you have a live site example, i'm struggling to see why creating an iframe doesn't work or why you don't use flash to get that (flash doesn't have same restrictions)
12:16  Husar: How can i get 'true' if div srollbar is actualy on bottom?
12:16  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: iframe works, wanted to get it done without iframe, cant show you the site legal constraints
12:16  mekwall: Anyone celebrating 1112131415?
12:16  iaj: monkeynut: thanks I just embedded it
12:17  monkeynut: Husar: test if $('mydiv').scrollTop() == $('mydiv').height();
12:17  chr: help me (-;
12:17  monkeynut: np iaj ;)
12:17  Husar: monkeynut: thx
12:17  monkeynut: sorry chr, i'll need a live link to see better, I was hoping someone who uses datepicker specifically would chime in for you
12:17  monkeynut: np Husar
12:17  iaj: monkeynut: http://www.marcgalal.com/kooperation.php  still not working do I have to buildin an else part there maybe?
12:18  iaj: i can't select m buttons anymore :D
12:18  chr: http://cahors.3wcom.com/public/jm/date/
12:18  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: the problem is the flash does a redirect, so in a iframe it will redirect inside the iframe, and i dont want that
12:18  monkeynut: iaj, yes, I thought I said you'd have to put the other response in ... I was just writing a small sample. If you have a pastebin i'll write it out if y ou don't get it ;)
12:19  iaj: monkeynut: friday sorry
12:19  chr: this link is not what you want ?
12:19  chr: http://cahors.3wcom.com/public/jm/date/
12:19  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: first, why not have it redirect inside the iframe? second, you can always get the contents of the iframe once it is loaded. or is there something i'm still not getting?
12:19  iaj: monkeynut: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/290362 it is.
12:19  monkeynut: iaj, np ... i've got a tired head too ;)
12:21  gls\Fr4NgUs: Pls someone can help me
12:21  gls\Fr4NgUs: http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/

12:22  iaj: monkeynut: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/290365/ like that?
12:22  iaj: ahh thanks
12:22  iaj: :)
12:22  gls\Fr4NgUs: pls monkeyunt ^^ you are strong
12:22  gls\Fr4NgUs: lol
12:22  monkeynut: iaj, try not to keep it all on one line, debuggin nightmare ;)
12:23  monkeynut: lol gls\Fr4NgUs ;)
12:23  monkeynut: what's the problem?
12:23  monkeynut: chr, i'm taking a look, might have missed it before, sorry
12:23  gls\Fr4NgUs: for the value of the dropdown menu or requests included in the price I am forced to move the slider.
12:23  gls\Fr4NgUs: Now I will like that when I select another option from the menu that day also puts the price.
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: i must move slider for update price
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: because i want when i select other option from dropdown my text_prix value change
12:27  monkeynut: alhors, chr, je ne comprend les problemes ... you want to select a specific date but using javascript rather than the user clicking? I can show you how to do that but i'm not sure that's what you want. the page doesn't look broken
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: french guys ?
12:27  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: have you tried using the .change( function ) event? what have you tried?
12:27  chr: oui
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: ^^ ok
12:27  monkeynut: je suis pas francais, j'ai regarde les 'site' a (what's french for date?) en francais ;)
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: ok ok
12:27  chr: je voudrais selectionner le mois en programmation
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: pourtant tu aprles bien francais lol
12:27  chr: en effet
12:27  chr: !!
12:27  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: was that enough? if you can't get it to work, ask again ;)
12:27  gls\Fr4NgUs: i d'ont understant chnage( ??
12:27  monkeynut: chr, you want to select any month? ok, i'll have a look.
12:27  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: the problem is that there is a micro photoshop in flash, it saves some images on server and redirects to a php page to save those image paths for the user in session
12:27  chr: yes but in command line not with button or combo
12:28  chr: with a function change_month()
12:28  gls\Fr4NgUs: monkeynut : .change( ??
12:28  monkeynut: chr, have you seen http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#method-setDate
12:29  iaj: monkeynut: adjusted code once again - still the same problem - not clickable anymore :'[
12:29  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: bind the change event to your select, then when someone chooses a different option, the handler you bound with change will be called.  In that handler you will select the field you want to update and update it's value.
12:30  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: now on the user end i have a screen where the iframe is loaded, now when the iframe redirects i want some changes done on the main page
12:30  ruby_on_tails: is that possible ?
12:30  monkeynut: iaj, i'll take a look in a mo, got quite a few people on the go atm!
12:30  ruby_on_tails: like the main page will have a h1 change, like "exporting images"
12:30  iaj: monkeynut: thanks so much :)   url is http://www.marcgalal.com/presse-news.php   if you want to check it out :\
12:30  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: do you have any conrol over the page that is being redirected to?
12:30  ruby_on_tails: yes
12:30  ruby_on_tails: everything is on my server
12:31  monkeynut: ok, then you can have the page that is redirected to call a function which is in the parent (outside the iframe) which does the stuff you want to the main page
12:31  chr: yes i see that before, my problem is not in this
12:32  chr: how make a function change_month(month, year) for select month in the calendar ?
12:32  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: however, if it's all on your server, why the cross domain question from before?
12:32  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: yes you can ignore that question, that was a mistake
12:32  gls\Fr4NgUs: <monkeynut> : can you write this in my document and click in update ?
12:32  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: but how can the new page where the iframe is redirected affect the main page ?
12:33  monkeynut: chr, in the docs it looks like you would select a specific (any) date in that month and it should show. or is that not what happens?
12:33  gls\Fr4NgUs: <monkeynut> : because i don't understant what i must to do
12:33  gls\Fr4NgUs: wirte in this doc ; http://www.jsfiddle.net/Kwgfj/29/
12:33  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: can iframe call a jquery function in the parent page ?
12:33  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails: window.parent.myfunctionname ;)
12:33  ruby_on_tails: hmm
12:34  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: lemme try that
12:34  monkeynut: i've used it ruby_on_tails , unless i've got that syntax squiffy, you can google to make sure but I think it's right. I know the technique works because i've used it myself several times
12:34  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: cool
12:34  monkeynut: on it gls\Fr4NgUs
12:34  gls\Fr4NgUs: thx
12:35  gls\Fr4NgUs: yes ?
12:36  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: so you want duree to update like memoire and processeur do?
12:36  chr: no, this way select a date but i want position calendar on a month whitout date selected
12:37  chr: like with combo month, but without combo, only in command
12:38  gls\Fr4NgUs: yes
12:38  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: you need to update the html, so that you can refer to each option individually. gimme a sec, i'm writing it in fiddler
12:38  chr: see  code now : http://cahors.3wcom.com/public/jm/date/
12:38  chr: like this
12:39  gls\Fr4NgUs: <monkeynut> : knowing that the price also includes the processor
12:39  gls\Fr4NgUs: memoire etc ...
12:39  monkeynut: chr, I see what you mean, if there's nothing in the docs we'll have to see if we can hack it, but i'll be very surprised if there's not afunction in the docs somewhere
12:40  chr: i'm blocked 3 month
12:40  chr: i dont see solution, help

12:43  philk_: I am using the UI Tabs and want each tabs content to display its own scrollbars
12:43  philk_: the page should not have any scrollbars (setting overflow:hidden). Which style should the divs of the tabs content have?
12:45  crashev: can someone help me with this -> http://3paste.com/s/1934 ,after clicking on link with node_add_0 (if op=='add') is called and in this function -> $("#div_createdir_name").focus(); -> thorws an error "too much recursion" ?
12:48  ruby_on_tails: i am using jquery ui modal dialog
12:48  ruby_on_tails: and want to have 2 buttons in the dialog
12:48  ruby_on_tails: buttons: [{ text: "Cancel", click: function() { $( this ).dialog( "close" ) }},{ text: "Next", click: function() { $( this ).dialog( "close" ) }}] but this isnt working
12:48  ruby_on_tails: it puts 2 button with text 0 and 1
12:48  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: the page is full of errors! i'm trying to work through them but I might just have to leave comments and let you have a go, i don't have time to write all the code for you :(
12:49  gls\Fr4NgUs: ok
12:49  ruby_on_tails: i read the code from http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-buttons
12:49  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: i've made some changes, I will make a few more and then show you what I got and you can work from there
12:49  iaj: monkeynut: am I able to set a radiobutton through console?? im trying to do a   document.forms.['kostenlosform'].elements['uid242_0'].checked = true currently but something is wrong about that one apparently
12:50  gls\Fr4NgUs: thx a lot
12:50  ruby_on_tails: infact when i copy paste code from http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-buttons it shows 0 on the button, is it a bug in the UI ?
12:51  ruby_on_tails: nvm i think i got it
12:52  monkeynut: good work ruby_on_tails
12:53  monkeynut: iaj, why not use jquery, since you're here ;)
12:54  ruby_on_tails: yea good job me :>
12:54  ruby_on_tails: :D
12:54  iaj: monkeynut: guess that's hard to do (atm) :P
12:55  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: it's strange, it seems to be complaining that updateprice() is not defined.  That's the last bit i'm sorting and then it should work
12:55  gls\Fr4NgUs: ok

13:03  Birliban: hi, does .append() have a callback?
13:03  monkeynut: ?append :P
13:03  bot-t: monkeynut, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
13:04  iaj: monkeynut: well unselecting works if i manually do a document.getElementById('radiobutton_id').checked = true ... so its SOME kind of working at least heh
13:04  Birliban: i was on this page before i asked ;-)
13:04  monkeynut: Birliban: unfortunately no, it doesn't. If you specify a fucntion it will be evaluated and the result will be appended
13:05  monkeynut: Birliban: however if you want something to happen when it's finished appending, just put it on the next line of code!!!
13:05  monkeynut: Birliban: if you want to react when the dom updates, there is an event to hook up ;)
13:05  Birliban: i did, but it seems that the next line is executed before it has finished appending
13:06  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: news on that code? it worked for me, do you like it? comments helpful?
13:06  gls\Fr4NgUs: nice
13:06  Birliban: monkeynut, ok, so i need to react on dom update... thx!

13:07  ruby_on_tails: Superman_:  :D
13:07  templ: Would you tell me please if inserting images into the dom is better or putting it into the html?
13:07  gls\Fr4NgUs: just change calculator
13:08  Superman_:  /msg ruby_on_tails hey how're you?
13:08  Superman_: :D
13:08  ruby_on_tails: :P
13:08  gls\Fr4NgUs: Monkeynut : i try to continue to works
13:08  gls\Fr4NgUs: Monkeynut : thx
13:08  monkeynut: templ, they have the same result
13:09  monkeynut: gls\Fr4NgUs: good luck with the rest of it, remember to read the little comments and try to stick to the (slightly) neater code patterns ;) good luck :)
13:09  templ: yes I know monkeynut :) but their results differ for SearchEngines
13:09  monkeynut: templ, if you want the search engine to find it, it must be a static <img> tag which is there when the page is served up
13:10  templ: oh :/
13:10  monkeynut: templ, search bots don't execute tonnes of javascript ;)
13:10  gls\Fr4NgUs: Yes thx
13:10  gls\Fr4NgUs: strong boy ^^
13:10  monkeynut: not really a jquery question, templ :P
13:10  templ: I've heart about #! URLs do you know anything about that?
13:10  jez9999: I'm developing a jQuery plugin, and i want to store a set of options for each different element it is applied to.  so, if i did "$('.myDivs').myPlugin({a:'b',c:'d'});" and say there were 3 'myDivs' elements, i'd be iterating through with an .each(); how can i store the passed options separately for each element (or what's the best way)?
13:10  Superman_: anybody help me with ajax loading
13:11  templ: templ: as far as I know #! URLs are there to restore state in jquery ajax apps
13:12  iaj: monkeynut: i bet it's just a little issue but I'm unable to figure it out -_X
13:12  templ: monkeynut: I'm building a "single page interface" for a gallery with albums
13:13  templ: and reloading the html to change the album breaks the experience.. that's why I'd like to use ajax for that.
13:13  Superman_: templ pls show it here
13:13  templ: what?
13:14  Superman_: single page interface
13:14  Superman_: gallery with albums
13:14  monkeynut: chr, i'm afraid your only solution seems to be the one I gave, pick a date in the month you want to set, update the datepicker and it will display that month, then the user will have to select the date they want.  if you make the day in that month '1' it will always start with the beginning of the month selected, will look quite natural.
13:15  templ: Superman_: it's not ready yet, as said I'm building it and I'm at that point where I think jquery templates make sense so that I replace the "album_template" with images depending on the album. and I thought about #! Urls, but don't know much about that
13:15  monkeynut: templ.  That's an amazingly original concept, how can we possibly know if it could be made to work?! :P post us a link to the live site or at least code in pastebin/jsfiddler
13:16  mekwall: Oh noes! I missed 1112131415!
13:16  monkeynut: iaj, you've still got a little issue left? remind me, i've lost track with all these people.
13:16  Superman_: hmmm :)
13:17  monkeynut: mekwall, thank god! there's a lot of people needing help here, i've barely got any of my own work done!
13:17  templ: amazingly original concept.. is that good or bad?
13:17  templ: I'm not sure what's so special about that...
13:17  iaj: haha monkeynut oh well check the page  http://www.marcgalal.com/presse-news.php  on the left side.. the radiobuttons aren't checkable
13:17  monkeynut: templ, that was just a joke.  It's been done 10000000 times before so we should be able to help you get it to work. but we need to see what the problem is first
13:18  iaj: even tho I put the codefragment on the site - when I manually check the radiobutton I can uncheck them atleast :D
13:18  kul: hello guys!
13:18  kul: I need 1 help !
13:18  monkeynut: templ, of if you've not so much got a problem but need direction, you need to be clearer about what you've got, what you can change e.t.c.
13:18  kul: I'm working on an animated website
13:18  templ: monkeynut: hahaha Ok :) My question is how I make a single_page interface in general, that would help me a lot
13:20  giggsey: Does anyone know of a plugin that can add a fixed header, and sortable headers to a table, whilst still working with CRUD on rows via the DOM?
13:20  monkeynut: iaj, try switching round the order of the things in the if {  } else {  } brackets. but you have another problem that there is an error your site is not properly loading ;)
13:20  Dev_Josh: giggsey, ajaxcrud man
13:20  iaj: monkeynut: I know that's the validation thing which I am not able to put off :\
13:21  iaj: monkeynut: k ill try sec
13:22  monkeynut: templ, have you seen jquery.ui layout? That will manage the layout for you and you can have for example the main block in the center being a div.  Then as the user clicks through controls of performs whatever actions, you can update the contents of that div in a myriad of ways. look at $.get, $(blah).load, or dynamically adding <img> tags . There's a whole load of options, you have to be a...
13:22  monkeynut: ...bit more concrete about what you want. Always pick the simplest way to get what you want ;)
13:22  giggsey: Dev_Josh: the CRUD needs to be client side. Everything needs to be done client side
13:22  templ: monkeynut: hmm maybe that question was confusing because I meant #! Urls not www.example.org/page#content
13:22 @coldhead: "The Social Network" is set in 2003/4--but it shows PCs running Windows XP Service Pack 3 (2008!)!
13:23  templ: here's a link http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/html-snapshot.html
13:23  iaj: monkeynut: tried.. but still this one is not working.. gnaaaa is the checked setting correct?
13:23  templ: It's not german even though google says de-DE
13:23  monkeynut: iaj, it is IIRC, I can check.
13:23  Dev_Josh: giggsey, that works on client side
13:24  monkeynut: templ, fur ich macht das keine unterscheid ;)
13:24  giggsey: Dev_Josh: and ideally free :P
13:24  templ: hahah cool :)
13:25  iaj: monkeynut: i put a alert() in the else part - it never gets executed
13:25  monkeynut: templ, i've had a look at that. it looks horrible, dirty, over-complicated and I can't see the benefits. Why are you trying to use this for a simple ajax gallery/
13:26  monkeynut: iaj, interesting, i'll take another look
13:26  iaj: the if :checked part seems to be true every time
13:26  templ: monkeynut: man.. you're so right! I'm always going the stoniest way..
13:26  giggsey: In fact Dev_Josh, those examples had the sorting on the server side
13:27 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:28  monkeynut: iaj, that doesn't have the latest code I wrote in, it's still the old code! I also can't see the alert or the else. my caching is turned off
13:28  monkeynut: or have you not updated http://www.marcgalal.com/kooperation.php ?
13:28  templ: monkeynut: It's bascially a mapper from #!key1=value1&key2=value2 to ?_escaped_fragment_=key1=value1%26key2=value2
13:29  templ: but I'll drop it
13:29  iaj: monkeynut: huh.. did you refresh properly
13:29  monkeynut: templ, I don't even want to look at it ;)  how much experience do you have coding? if not much, I suggest you use a jquery gallery plugin ;)
13:29  monkeynut: iaj, yes and I have caching turned off
13:30  monkeynut: iaj, unless you left in the old script as well as new script I can't find, but if so, that's part of the problem
13:30  templ: I think I've lots of coding experience, in all sorts of languages, I'm comfortable with jquery, but far away from good
13:30  iaj: monkeynut: I just reloaded for me it says  http://pastebin.com/pkybGeGF
13:30  monkeynut: ok templ, in that case, I think you should roll your own, it will be a good experience and very flexible ;)
13:31  iaj: I really cleared the old stuff out -__
13:32  iaj: monkeynut: you sure its there??!  oO
13:33  monkeynut: iaj, when I go to this site http://www.marcgalal.com/kooperation.php  only the old code is shown in firebug. The new code you posted on pastebin is not there at all. I'm positive nothing is cached e.t.c, that is what is being served from your server ;)
13:33  templ: I still think about how I should make it look and behave. So far I think there will be a gallery page with a dropdown like nav that has top level images that zoom a thumb on hover and open a gallery that uses jquery templates to load different sets of images
13:34  monkeynut: iaj, perhaps you haven't exported changes to the webroot?
13:34  iaj: but Im refreshing with SHIFT-R (no caching) in firefox as well :\
13:34  templ: I can't decide..fullscreen, lightbox like, or within the page...
13:36  monkeynut: iaj, i've completely disabled all caching, i've even fired up a proxy and checked that is the page coming in before my browser even sees it. I think you have a server configuration issue.
13:37  monkeynut: iaj, that is if it's not a human error issue ;)
13:37  templ: monkeynut: what type of multi album gallery would you like? one that opens a lightbox per album? (cheap imho), on that opens a fullscreen gallery set browse mode, or something different?
13:37  monkeynut: templ, that's all aesthetic, i'm good at coding but rubbish with making things pretty
13:38  iaj: monkeynut: wahh wtf.. I really built it in... :\ its getting displayed for me
13:38  iaj: monkeynut: right above the form, the jquery part.
13:38  iaj:     if (($this).attr('checked')) {   that would be a correct way to check to right?
13:38  iaj: this one is always TRUE as well.. :(
13:38  templ: monkeynut: well thanks for helping me :)
13:39  monkeynut: iaj, that's where I was looking and it's just come back with the new code now!!!
13:39  iaj: monkeynut: wth :\
13:39  iaj: well at least you can see it now :D
13:41  monkeynut: iaj, have you put an alert anywhere else to see that the click handler is called?
13:41  iaj: monkeynut: no but previously I was able to unselect stuff.. so I guess its working
13:42  monkeynut: iaj, ok, and did you try swapping false and true around in the $(this).attr(   part ??
13:43  monkeynut: iaj, I'm thinking the event handler might actually be running when the browser has already changed state, so it always flips back to what it was before it was clicked.
13:44  iaj: monkeynut: ok.... something ain't working properly as I can see.. reload I built in alerts for both handling events - nothing happens - what the heck :(
13:44  monkeynut: right, so the handler is probably not running.    change the .click(   to a .live('click',
13:45  monkeynut: (btw, if you do that you can remove the document.ready bit)
13:47  iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/290397 like that/
13:47  monkeynut: iaj, why is the server so far behind your updates? I'm still seeing the code before you put 2 alerts in!!!
13:48  iaj: hmmmm dunno -_-  I'm seeing it immediaetely
13:48  dean[w]: I have a problem with jquery ui dialogs. I am loading some html content (which contains an anchor) and then placing that content in a dialog. When I click the anchor in the dialog (modal) nothing happens. Any ideas why that might be?
13:48  monkeynut: iaj, not quite like that, i'm making a pastebin for you
13:49  iaj: thanks monkeynut im going for dinner ( have to )
13:49  iaj: :\ ill be back in 1hr approx... tahnks for all your help and efforts so far
13:50  monkeynut: ok, in that case ask me again in an hour, or i'll probably lose the link ;)
13:50  iaj: thanks ill come back to you
13:51  iaj: could you highlight my name with the pastebin when your done?
13:51  iaj: thankie!
13:51  monkeynut: dean[w] could be loads of problems, what have you tried? can you see it? have you looked in firebug? does anything overlap it? do you have click handlers bound?  can you post us a link to live example of problem?
13:52  monkeynut: iaj, i'll do the update when you get back
13:52  monkeynut: iaj, if you're at lunch, other people may need my help more urgently ;)
13:52  monkeynut: I need to go to lunch soon too!
13:52  monkeynut: (and have a lot of work to do today)
13:56  dean[w]: monkeynut, ive looked in firebug, anchor looks fine. i can see it. nothing overlaps it that i cvan see, i dont have any click handlers bound on the link.
13:57  dean[w]: live link isn't possible, it's internal development site. I know that makes it hard to pinpoint the problem. But i was suspicious that anything in a modal dialog has its events stopped
14:04  mekwall: wow! I just got a great idea to throw at mozilla and chrome devs!
14:06  mekwall: when bookmarking, it should recommend category and tags according to previously made bookmarks on that site
14:06  mekwall: that would be awesome!
14:06  ablomen: mekwall, can't you just make your default bookmark folder "porn" ?
14:07  mekwall: ablomen, justin bieber doesn't fit in porn now does it?
14:07  mekwall: perhaps for you...
14:07  ablomen: if its the southpark clip, yes
14:12  monkeynut: dean[w]: can you post some code on pastebin? copy/paste the relevant section from firebug or something?
14:13  dean[w]: i fixed it monkeynut, but thanks :D
14:14  dean[w]: had some interfering z-index in a css file
14:16  monkeynut: I was wondering that, but I thought it wouldn't be because the link was visible. good work :)
14:18  philWeb: hi I've read that find('*') is not working under some circumstances since 1.4.3 (something was fixed within 1.4.4 but doesn't work for me)
14:19  philWeb: what changed between 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 so that it's not working for all possibilities?
14:23  dean[w]: monkeynut, what was even more peculiar is that the hover css on the link worked, but not the click :) Oh well!

14:46  prs: data itself supposed to be json, and the server returns it w/ mime application/javascript. Althought it might treat it like a string.
14:47  prs: Guest84030: yes, it's a string.
14:47  Guest84030: are you using prs malsup form plugin?

14:49  solsTiCe: hi. how do i get the value of the selected value in a <select> tag. I was using $('#level').val() before but this does not seem to work anymore
14:50  Guest84030: do you yourself provide that data parameter?
14:50  solsTiCe: well I got [] in some circonstances
14:50  solsTiCe: and others it woks. need to find why
14:51  Guest84030: @prs?
14:52  prs: Guest84030: what do you mean by "do i provide"?
14:52  solsTiCe: ok. it was because i changed some value to diabled before getting the value
14:52  vhpoet: I have a problem with $.load... http://pastie.org/1292579 it's not always binding load event.. can u help me?
14:54  ablomen: vhpoet, https://github.com/peol/jquery.imgloaded/raw/master/ahpi.imgload.js << use this plugin
14:54  ablomen: vhpoet, there are problems with the .load event with images that are loaded from cache
14:54  ablomen: that plugin should fix it
14:56  Guest84030: binding load to images is tricky. and afaik even that plugin can't fix all problems
14:56  jez9999: I'm developing a jQuery plugin, and i want to store a set of options for each different element it is applied to.  so, if i did "$('.myDivs').myPlugin({a:'b',c:'d'});" and say there were 3 'myDivs' elements, i'd be iterating through with an .each(); how can i store the passed options separately for each element (or what's the best way)?
15:02  iaj: monkeynut: im back on track ;p
15:02  iaj: you still around?
15:04  freedgy: jez9999: maybe with .data() ?

15:05 --- Silker is now known as Sliker
15:11 --- gat is now known as gat|away
15:11 --- Silker is now known as Sliker
15:11  monkeynut: hey iaj, i'm around now, I was away for a bit.  but i'm getting behind with my own work so I can only answer short/easy questions at the moment, I can't bug hunt right now unforrtunatly
15:15  monkeynut: jez9999 you can have a properties object for each element all contained in a mater object, the key for each property being linked to a classname or attribute identifying the tag
15:15  monkeynut: s/mater/master
15:16  jez9999: monkeynut: yeah i think that's kind of done for you with jquery's .data()
15:19  monkeynut: jez9999 it's one way (and a good way), sorry I thought you said you tried that and it wasn't suitable for some reason.
15:19  jez9999: im just wondering what the standard way for doing this is
15:20  serio_: I never did my drewing
15:20  jez9999: a plugin that can be differently configured for each element
15:21  monkeynut: jez9999: if that's all your after, the standard jquery way is with .data().  I personally think what I suggested is more flexible but might get a chewing for not suggesting the pure jquery best practice ;)
15:21  jez9999: why would it be more flexible?
15:22  sveajobb: Hi, how can I modify this so it also allows https://  ? $('a[@href^="http://"]')
15:23  monkeynut: jez9999: e.g. you wouldn't have to know or care about selecting the tags to get at the data, you have a pure js object that's easy to debug. random stuff, sorry don't have time to explain but it's just a pref unless you have a good reason otherwise really. stick with the jquery way and you'll get more support for issues from here in general ;)
15:24  jez9999: yeah, the jquery way seems cleaner.  the code shouldnt even have access to the options for the other elements
15:24  monkeynut: sveajobb href^="http?://"
15:25  ph8: can i "break;" out of a $.each() ?
15:25  jez9999: ph8: return false
15:25  monkeynut: i'd say you're good to go with that method, if there are no problems with it or further requirements, good luck :)
15:25  ph8: ah ofc thx
15:25  sveajobb: monkeynut, ah of course.. but won't  ? actually expect a char?
15:25  sveajobb: I mean so http:// will be excluded
15:25  monkeynut: sveajobb yes it will
15:26  monkeynut: sveajobb, I thought that made an optional char
15:26  monkeynut: well, it does with regex I thought jquery followed that, lemme check
15:26  serio_: sveajobb, just add the 's' then?
15:26  monkeynut: sveajobb: if you want to make absolutely sure you'd have to put both in explicity, seperated by comma
15:27  sveajobb: serio_,  I want http:// and https:// I'm not sure how to do that
15:27  serio_: check what monkeynut said
15:27  serio_: that was going to be my suggestion before he mentioned his.
15:27  monkeynut: sveajobb: $('a[@href^="http://"],a[@href^="https://"]') is guaranteed to give what you want but is not the cleanest
15:28  sveajobb: monkeynut, serio_  excellent, thanks for the help :)
15:28  monkeynut: np
15:32  serio_: actually sveajobb, you could use contains instead
15:32  serio_: $( "a[href*='http']" )
15:33  serio_: will work for both http + https (and any url that contains *http*
15:33  sveajobb: serio_, that's true. I wonder if that would be slower though? might be neglible
15:34  serio_: it's less stringent too, so it could be prone to errors if the url happens to have http somewhere else in it...
15:34  serio_: or, href rather
15:34  sveajobb: yeah, but that I could live with actually :)
15:34  serio_: <a href='how-to-make-https-requests'></a>
15:34  serio_: for example
15:34  sveajobb: it's just for setting up google analytics to measure outgoing links
15:37  monkeynut: serio_ that will match waaay too much
15:37  monkeynut: what if he has a page with http in it?
15:37  monkeynut: (i mean in title)
15:38  serio_: I already explained the pitfalls.
15:38  monkeynut: sorry dude
15:38  monkeynut: missed that
15:38  sveajobb: I guess a more sane approach would just to ignore the :// part
15:39  sveajobb: that way the file has to begin with http_something_else.html or whatever
15:39  monkeynut: sveajobb either ignore that part or use the selector i gave you, whatever you think is prettiest and give least headache ;)
15:39  pif: what is the best tooltip plugin?
15:39  sveajobb: monkeynut, I went with your "double" selector :)
15:39  monkeynut: :)
15:40  monkeynut: pif, try them and see which you prefer. there is on just called tooltip I thought was good. Personally I think the title attribute is good enough ;)
15:40  pif: most of the time, yes
15:40  serio_: truthfully you're probablly better off just putting rel='external' on your outbound links and selecting based on rel attr
15:41  serio_: ^^sveajobb
15:42  sveajobb: serio_, yeah I guess that would be a good approach, although I'm writing this script for another company who has a retarded web agency.. so changing the code is not really an option :)
15:44  sveajobb: (the html-code that is)
15:45  serio_: I thought that might be the case

15:52  eirikb: ajpiano: Thanks
15:55  Altreus: hey. Using jquery 1.4.2. I am using .change(function) on a selector that matches a <select>. The selector is a CSS class rather than ID so that I can apply it to multiple. Anyway, according to Chrome's debugger, within the function, 'this' is an HTMLSelectElement, but $(this) is a DOMWindow. I can't work out what I've done wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/Xw4hu/
15:56  giggsey: Does anyone know of a plugin that can add a fixed header, and sortable headers to a table, whilst still working with CRUD on rows via the DOM?
15:57  danheberden: Altreus: throw some markup in that jsfiddle so we can see it work wrong
15:58  Altreus: danheberden: ok just a tick
15:58  Altreus: Watch it work ._.
15:58  Altreus: hmm
15:58  pif: hel, self you perl guy
15:59  Altreus: pif: what you do you call $(this) so you don't have to keep running $(this)?
15:59  Brodingo: ajpiano i did a drawing
15:59  danheberden: though var $this = $(this); has been getting popular
15:59  pif: $self
15:59  ajpiano: Altreus: $this or elem etc
16:00  Altreus: oh right
16:00  Altreus: Anyway!
16:00  ajpiano: Altreus: you can get around this in a number of way
16:00  pif: the '$' helps remeber is't  a JQ object
16:00  danheberden: and it also makes your code worth more
16:00  Altreus: epic dollar
16:01  JeffJassky: Hey, guys. I'm really awful with regular expressions. I'm trying to make an expression that will match a forward slash if it is the first or last character of a string. for example /path/to/dir/ would match the first and last /.
16:01  Altreus: I put some html in it, but I can't get it to actually run the function
16:01  Altreus: oh I forgot to add jquery
16:02  Altreus: http://jsfiddle.net/Xw4hu/2/  Here's what I have, no changes ...
16:02  Altreus: Not sure how to check whether it's actually working or not
16:02  monkeynut: JeffJassky   /^\/|\/$/
16:02  JeffJassky: is | a group separator or something?
16:03  monkeynut: JeffJassky, that's the or
16:03  JeffJassky: ahhh gotchya!
16:03  monkeynut: ;)
16:03  mekwall: god damn it... this friday is killing me
16:03  Altreus: hmm
16:03  Altreus: ok it works here so it must be my markup
16:03  mekwall: haven't even had time to be in here :(
16:04  danheberden: Ya, Altreus looks like it's workin'
16:04  ajpiano: Brodingo, yay!!
16:04  Altreus: hell, if I put $(this) in Chrome's console it says [ <select ... > ]
16:05  Brodingo: i guess i shouldve said "i maek a drawling"
16:05  Altreus: But if I do var self = $(this) it is like no that's a window
16:06  Altreus: wtf. The vars type and target both have the correct values
16:06  Altreus: But if I try to run the procedure I used to get their values it says self has no method 'parents'
16:06  ajpiano: Altreus: you could just do callback.call(self)
16:07  ajpiano: Altreus: i also kinda think it has to do with how you're defining the function
16:07  switchback: hey guys, I am looping over an array and then doing an if check to see if a value exists, if it does, I an calling $(#target).show(); Only problem is that hidden div shows for a brief second, not sure why, any idea?
16:07  ajpiano: function callback() {}  instead of var callback = function() {}
16:07  Altreus: ajpiano: which function? the callback?
16:07  Brodingo: ajpiano http://brodingo.com/img/summat.jpg
16:07  Altreus: ajpiano: I want it to be local ...
16:07  Altreus: Anyway I'm inspecting the value of self before the function is created
16:07  ajpiano: Altreus, it will be local
16:07  ajpiano: it will be private to the cilck function
16:07  ajpiano: either way
16:07  Altreus: I think that Chrome is buggy
16:08  IceKiller: hey i'm using a function that shows & hides a class called onecolumn, but i'm not sure how i'm able to retrieve the unique id from it with the $(this) stuff i either get undefined or html span element message
16:08  Altreus: It thinks self is a DOMWindow but it lets me carry on using it
16:08  ajpiano: Altreus, this isn't a chrome issue
16:08  monkeynut: switchback: looks like something else is hiding it again afterwards, put up link to problem site or code in pastebin ;)
16:08  switchback: monkeynut: ok
16:09  serio: ajpiano, I did not do a drewing :(
16:09  Altreus: ajpiano: I am not sure why what you are saying makes a difference.
16:09  Altreus: anyway it works now
16:09  Altreus: I forgot I turned four vars into one object
16:09  monkeynut: IceKiller: $(this).attr('id') works if that tag has an id
16:09  monkeynut: IceKiller: I think you should post code on pastebin
16:10  IceKiller: hm weird i'm pretty sure i tried that and got undefined
16:10  IceKiller: but let me try it again ^^
16:10  switchback: monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/1ZBNEE4J thats the code, mainly line 4 and line 33 is what I am working on now but that #promotions gets hidden somewhere again heh
16:10  ajpiano: Altreus http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
16:10  monkeynut: IceKiller: if that doesn't work then your span doesn't have an id, could mean your not selecting the span you think you are
16:11  Harris: :)
16:11  monkeynut: easy Harris ;)

16:12  jez9999: ya know what would be cool?  if 'queue' in .animate() could take a string instead of a bool
16:12  matt1982: hey can anyone explain why I dont get a negative number when I times by -1 this is my code http://pastebin.com/xKJ2m072
16:12  jez9999: the string would indicate WHICH queue to queue the animation in.
16:12  jez9999: then, i could have a per-element queue of animations
16:13  Altreus: ajpiano: cool, reading
16:13  danheberden: yes, reading IS cool
16:14  monkeynut: switchback: are you sure you posted the right code? lines 4 to 33 don't seem related to what you were saying and on't seem to contain $(this) at all!?
16:14  sandstrom: I need autocomplete for a few different purposes. One being a a long select (need to pick from a pre-defined list of items) with local data. Second being a similar select, but with data stored on a server (still user needs to pick from the predefined values). Thirdly a "basic" autocomplete where you could use the hint, or type something new. Also, there should be a separation of values and labels (or keys/values if you wish), since the labels n
16:14  sandstrom: translation. Any suggestions on which plugin I should use?
16:14  IceKiller: http://pastebin.com/fUsEEi3P thats the piece of code
16:15  switchback: monkeynut: hmm let me double check
16:17  monkeynut: switchback: your problem was elements hiding in a loop right? I don't see that in the pastebin
16:18  monkeynut: IceKiller: that span does not have an id
16:19  monkeynut: IceKiller: http://pastebin.com/HcsgNkng    and you can use firebug console to see the element in the DOM
16:19  switchback: monkeynut: well, take a look at line 37 in that paste, thats where I try to show the div when the form is submitted. Basically what happens is user submits form, code checks to see if what was submitted is in the array (line 4) and if it is then display the #promotions div.
16:20  switchback: I do see the form for a quick second then it disappears hehe.
16:23  switchback: monkeynut: can I paste you the URL in /query ? kinda a private page :)
16:23  vmasto: Hello, does anyone know why I can't put 2 autocompletes in the same DOM using jquery-ui ?

16:29  AlexC_: ahh, this is true. I forgot that the world is quite large. 15:28 here in Tea and Cake land
16:29  danheberden: i would expect in the very near future ;)
16:29  danheberden: if you need a cdn like right away, the microsoft cdn is updated
16:29  stuk_gen: hi all :)
16:29  vmasto: Guys? Anyone knows if I can have 2 different autocompletes in the same page, using jquery-ui ?
16:29  danheberden: which is odd, google was way faster for jqueryui 1.8.6 than ms
16:29  danheberden: and this time, its flippy floppied
16:30  stuk_gen: i can i send array() to php with jquery?

16:30  ohst: I have the following code which causes and unresponsive script
16:30  ohst: http://pastie.org/1292857
16:30  ohst: Anyway to optimize?
16:30  danheberden: unresponsive?
16:31  ohst: I am adding .html() to 12000 elements
16:31  danheberden: ?g i dont want to talk about it book

16:31  danheberden: read it that book
16:31  vmasto: ajpiano: http://jsbin.com/ijuzi3/edit check this out, any idea why the second autocomplete gets cancelled out, always?
16:31  danheberden: ohst - two things
16:31  ohst: yeah, you get an unresponsive script when you do some heave work
16:31  ajpiano: that's not a demo
16:31  danheberden: if you HAVE to do it that way, then break up the work load
16:32  danheberden: have a function do 1000, then setTimeout() a few ms and do the next 1000
16:32  vmasto: ajpiano: I know but isn't that supposed to be functional by default?
16:32  vmasto: i just create the 2 arrays
16:32  ajpiano: yes, but i am not a psychic
16:32  vmasto: for sources
16:32  danheberden: but perhaps you don't have to iterate the .html() 1200 times? maybe you can make ONE html call?
16:33  danheberden: (and maybe 100, not 1000 - thought you said 12000)
16:33  ohst: yeah its 12000
16:33  danheberden: THATS OVER 9000!!
16:33  Jonz: 12,000 is the correct number for all iterations.
16:33  Jonz: I make all my loops do 12,000
16:34  stuk_gen: AlexC_: look this http://pastebin.com/Hs3wM6X6 is correct? the php script not receive anything!
16:34  danheberden: concatenating the html and injecting it once, instead of injecting html 12000 times will be WAAAAYYY faster
16:34  ohst: I have 3000 rows in the table and each row has 4 .checks with a value of 1 or 0
16:34  danheberden: icky
16:35  ohst: what do you mean by concatenating the html?
16:35  danheberden: well, say you had to add like 10000 divs
16:35  ajpiano: danheberden, the approach won't work cause he needs to insert into individual elements
16:35  ajpiano: one at a time
16:35  danheberden: ajpiano: ya, i saw that
16:36  danheberden: in tables 'n shit
16:36  ajpiano: ohst, it would be faster if you a ) avoided creating new elements inside of every thing, create the two chckboxes out side of the loop  b) tried doing some of the manipulation Off the dom
16:37  ajpiano: (by using .detach()
16:37  ajpiano: but the fundamental thing is like
16:37  ajpiano: creating 1200 elements is kinda always gonna hang the browser
16:37  Jonz: any chance you can do that work on the server-side
16:38  ohst: its actually 12,000
16:38  ajpiano: ^^
16:38  ajpiano: ohst, creating 12,000 will ALWAYS hang the browser
16:38  ajpiano: ohst, consider this
16:38  ajpiano: the high-performing grid plugins like slickgrid
16:38  ajpiano: ONLY keep elements that are VISIBLE in the dom
16:38  ajpiano: to cut down on manipulation, keep the dom small and manipulable
16:38  ajpiano: everything else is kept in memory
16:39  monkeynut: sounds like ohst needs to do more server-side processing first ;)
16:39  stuk_gen: someone help my to send to php an array? look this http://pastebin.com/Hs3wM6X6
16:39  ohst: yeah that might be the way to go

16:42  josh___: Hey all.  Got a question about jQuery templates, if anyone can give me a hand.  Is there anyway to update the data a template is being rendered against, or would you just delete the dom and regen the template ( ie... jQuery("#foo").tmp(newData).appendTo.... )
16:43  danheberden: josh___: if the data is changing (but the same format) you'd just render it
16:44  josh___: ie: empty where the original dom went, and call render again?  So... no way to preserve event handlers that were applied to the original dom?
16:45  josh___: danheberden: rather, call tmpl again
16:45  danheberden: oh, like you want 'update' that visible portion
16:45  josh___: yeah
16:45  danheberden: ya, that'd be either a re-render and attach or just update the content manually kinda thing
16:45  josh___: ouch.  Thanks!
16:46  danheberden: maybe move your events to be delegated to the parent container?
16:46  danheberden: then you don't have to have any events on the tmpl items themselves
16:46  danheberden: and you only have ONE handler instead of multiple
16:46  josh___: Right.  However, it means that I really shouldn't include widgets in the template
16:48  josh___: danheberden: or rather, shouldn't do things like have tabs in the template section.
16:48  danheberden: ya, might be better to break that down a little
16:48  josh___: thanks

Now what im trying to do is separate out the triggers for each event:  the ".mouseenter" for "#multi-ddm" ... and the ".mouseenter" for "#account-ddm" ... both DIVs have a child called "ddmStateCont" which has two children ".dropActive" and ".dropInactive"
16:57  delinquentme: CURRENTLY .. triggering one div ... fires off the event to both sets of ".ddmStateCont" divs
16:58  monkeynut: TimothyA:   yeah, compatible with 1.2.x should work above but may be broken, please report it if it is.  You can roll your own with jquery as in http://blog.adampresley.com/2010/fisheye-menu-with-jquery/
16:58  monkeynut: it's not a complicated widget ;)
16:58  stuk_gen: when i using post to send array to a php script, the script receive an array[0] with all context is here, why ?

22:40  fiskfisk: but how can I get this into a function that listen (in the same way as .live() )
22:40 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
22:41  ajpiano: ?liveQuery
22:41  bot-t: ajpiano, Live Query | jQuery Plugins - Live Query (formerly Behavior) utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM upda... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery
22:41  ajpiano: dilvie: i haven't a good idea at the moment aside from like, triggering the change inside the otherhandler
22:42  dub54: how comes the checkbox doesnt stay checked? the $.get request returns the right values, but whether it's checked or unchecked it only ever stays unchecked .. http://pastebin.com/Dd195GUp
22:42  dub54: oh
22:42  dub54: ignore that
22:43  dilvie: ajpiano: yeah, that wouldn't work (the other handler doesn't have the right context), but I think I have a solution. Thanks. =)
22:43  ajpiano: cool
22:43  ajpiano: do share it eventually
22:46  compaq: textBox.toLowerCase(); doesn't work for me
22:46  compaq: it works in my browser, but not in my jquery program
22:47  dilvie: ajpiano: I'm planning to poll the value of the element I want to manipulate until it returns a value - because at that point, I know it's ready for me to trigger the change event.
22:47  ajpiano: yipe
22:47  dilvie: yipe?
22:47  dilvie: is that a poor solution?
22:48  yunosh: hi, what's the counterpart of rel="external" for forms in jquery-mobile?
22:48  snover: polling is never a good solution :(
22:48  snover: yunosh: um, no rel="external"? : )
22:48  dilvie: with setInterval() ...
22:48  snover: dilvie: you’re killing me.
22:48  dilvie: urm, I mean setTimeout.
22:48  dilvie: no need for setInterval. =)
22:49  yunosh: snover: heh. no, i mean, how can i keep forms from being submitted through ajax. like what i can do with rel="external" in links?
22:49  dilvie: snover: seems like a better solution than setting the delay to some arbitrarily high value just to be sure it's ready.
22:49  yunosh: the opposite of data-role="ajaxform" from alpha1. this seems to be the default now
22:49  snover: dilvie: but not as good as listening for an appropriate event.
22:50  dilvie: snover: yeah, but the select element doesn't emit events when it's ready to have its value read.
22:51  snover: Sorry, which component are you using again?
22:51  dilvie: snover: it's just an html select element.. need to trigger change from within the change handler of another element
22:52  snover: how about triggering a custom event from whatever component you are using to populate the select?
22:52  dilvie: but if I trigger it before the target select element is ready to have the value read, it breaks.
22:52  snover: $select.append(options).trigger('populated')
22:52  dilvie: snover: that's not what's happening.
22:53  yunosh: looks like i can only turn it off globally through $.mobile.ajaxFormsEnabled?
22:53  dilvie: I'll implement my hacky polling solution and then paste so you guys can show me what an idiot I am. =)
22:53  dilvie: right now I just need to make it work. =)
22:53  dilvie: hehe

23:18  converge: in a jQuery.ajax({ error: {.. } })) what do i need return to use the "error" condition.. ?
23:18  ajpiano: a server response in the 400s

23:22  draginx: How can I override a click in jquery mobile?
23:23  dilvie: if anybody's curious about my trigger-in-a-handler problem, here's how I solved it.
23:23  dilvie: http://pastie.org/1293854
23:24  m0dmd: ajpiano http://pastebin.com/vYqRgejL
23:24  dilvie: polling = evil!
23:24  dilvie: aaaaah!
23:25  m0dmd: ajpiano i also came across this http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=597278 and the fix is -> $("#account").result(function(event, data, formatted) { $("#account_value").val(data["id"]); });
23:25  ajpiano: that autocomplete plugin is kinda old now btw
23:26  m0dmd: wow
23:26  m0dmd: wish they said that at jquery ui website
23:26  dilvie: omg double polling, wtf, what does it mean!???
23:26  ajpiano: what
23:26  mcrittenden1: anybody know how to trigger a click on a <select> option in such a way that it triggers any handlers that are supposed to execute when the option is clicked? using .val() selects the option but doesn't execute any of the select handlers
23:26  ajpiano: said what at the ui website
23:26  dilvie: omg double polling all the way!
23:26  ajpiano: m0dmd, the ui autocomplete is all over the ui website
23:26  m0dmd: it's listed on their site with New next to it
23:27  ajpiano: yeah
23:27  ajpiano: that's new
23:27  ajpiano: this .result() syntax
23:27  ajpiano: is from an older plugin
23:27  ajpiano: :)
23:27  m0dmd: oh
23:27  ajpiano: there's a callback in autocomplete
23:27  m0dmd: how do I get the selected result to change the val of the input field
23:27  ajpiano: for when they pick something, i think it's select
23:27  dilvie: mcrittenden1: .trigger()
23:28  borismus: what's the "correct" way of passing parameters between jQM pages? i'm doing it with get params: index.html#other.html?foo=bar, but pageshow fires before the URL is updated.
23:28  draginx: does jquery mobile support addClass and removeClass :S
23:29  kold: I've seen the proxy() function in jQuery 1.4, but am on a site tied to 1.3 until we can test everything on our site and upgrade to 1.4....is there a way to accomplish the context proxy() is sending to the event handler with jQuery 1.3?
23:29  m0dmd: ajpiano i'm reading the #event-select right now, thanx for the guidance. hope i could figure this out
23:30  snover: kold: just pull out the $.proxy function from 1.4 and make it into a plugin
23:30  tinio: hi.  knowing that it's considered bad practice to determine browser by sniffing for user-agent, what's a recommended way to check if a browser supports touch events?
23:30  snover: kold: there is nothing special about it really
23:30  m0dmd: ajpiano The default action of select is to replace the text field's value with the value of the selected item.
23:30  ajpiano: ?hitch @ kold
23:30  bot-t: kold, jQuery.hitch: Advanced scope manipulation plugin for jQuery. http://higginsforpresident.net/js/static/jq.hitch.js The inspiration for jQuery 1.4's $.proxy.
23:30  m0dmd: ajpiano and it's not functioning the way it should.
23:31  ajpiano: m0dmd, i know.... i've never heard of it not passing the value when the form is submitted
23:31  m0dmd: ajpiano so i have to force that action since it's not by default correct?
23:31  kold: snover: I'm having trouble getting context passed to a bind event, but that's a good option, thanks
23:31  kold: ajpiano: thanks will give it a look
23:31  ajpiano: no you shouldn't have to force it
23:32  m0dmd: i think i'll stick to a select :(
23:33  ajpiano: i'm working on a test case that should show this concretely
23:33  snover: tinio: modernizr detects for touch events.
23:34  mcrittenden1: dilvie: I'm not able to select an option using trigger('click') ...have you done that before?
23:35  snover: mcrittenden1: if you are simulating events to change stuff on the page you’re doing it wrong…
23:35 --- mcrittenden1 is now known as mcrittenden
23:35  m0dmd: ajpiano i could understand if the default functionality of an input field when entering data and submitting were to pass after submitting the form twice
23:35  dilvie: mcrittenden1: five minutes age.
23:35  dilvie: ago, even.
23:36  ajpiano: i havee no idea what you'r talking about
23:36  mcrittenden: snover: basically, I'm using Google Translate's dropdown menu to translate a site, but it doesn't persist across pages so I have to manually select the right language in the dropdown on each page load and get the translation to run
23:36  dilvie: snover may be right about that.
23:36  ajpiano: tbh
23:36  mcrittenden: snover: I don't really know a way around doing it that way
23:36  snover: mcrittenden: I am sure that they have an api.
23:37  dilvie: mcrittenden: Here's how I solved that problem a few minutes ago. http://pastie.org/1293854
23:37  tinio: snover: thx.  i was aware of modernizr but was trying to avoid the extra 36kb when touch support is the only feature i'm trying to detect
23:37  snover: tinio: it’s 3.8kB.
23:37  snover: tinio: Also the tests are self-encapsulated so you can roll your own.
23:37  dilvie: mcrittenden: If there's a select condition you can test for, you can wait for that condition to be met using setTimeout(), and then call your trigger.
23:37  ajpiano: m0dmd, are you saying that when you select an item in the autocomplete menu, and then you submit the form, the value isn't passed to the form??
23:38  snover: dilvie: I have a better idea
23:38  snover: dilvie mcrittenden http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/overview.html
23:39  dilvie: snover: perhaps. =)
23:39  snover: http://translate.google.com/translate_tools
23:39  snover: seriously
23:39  snover: come on guys
23:39  tinio: snover: ahh, misread the size.  also did look for the specific tests and it does look simple enough.  Thanks!
23:39  mcrittenden: snover: you can't just google and shoot a link, it's a lot more complicated than that
23:40  snover: mcrittenden: not really…
23:40  mcrittenden: snover: If I resort to the API, I have to completely reinvent the wheel
23:40  mcrittenden: snover: whereas google already gives you a dropdown that does the work for you, I just need to make the selection persist across pages.
23:40  dilvie: snover didn't like the polling solution for my problem, but didn't give me a viable alternative, either. =)
23:41  snover: mcrittenden: if only there were something like “selectedIndex” or something, but I guess not.
23:42  ajpiano: m0dmd, ok, now i see what you're talking about
23:42  snover: dilvie: I never really saw an explanation of what exactly your problem was, just that due to ??? you couldn’t interact with a drop-down
23:42  D3f0: hi, how should I document my plugin, in particular, function parameters? any tip?
23:43  ajpiano: m0dmd: you gotta use the change event, not the select event :)
23:43  draginx: does addClass() work in jquery mobile?
23:43  dilvie: snover: due to the fact that the drop-down was being manipulated by another event handler and wasn't giving me a valid value... I had to somehow wait for the other event handler to finish doing its thing, and then fire the target handler.
23:44  snover: dilvie: asynchronous event handler?
23:44  dilvie: snover: aren't event handlers asynchronous by definition?
23:45  snover: dilvie: JS is single-threaded. A second event handler cannot execute before the first one is finished executing
23:46  snover: The only way the first event handler could be doing something would be if it fires off its own set of asynchronous functions, like calling $.ajax or something
23:46  draginx: http://pastie.org/1293916 why doesnt this work?
23:46  dilvie: snover: that's exactly what's going on.
23:46  draginx: but the console.logs()s do work
23:46  dilvie: snover: thank you for your brilliant input. =)
23:47  ajpiano: dilvie: that's kidn of what i was getting at
23:47  ajpiano: i think i was a little  vague
23:47  ajpiano: :/
23:47  snover: dilvie: In that case you should attach your other handler separately to a custom event that the first one first once it is done doing whatever it is doing in $.ajax
23:47  snover: first one fires*
23:48  dilvie: snover, ajpiano: don't take my sacrasm seriously. I really do appreciate your input. =)
23:48  draginx: no one knows if jquery mobile cna properly do addClass? hmm
23:48 --- c4rl_ is now known as c4rl
23:49  snover: dilvie: do what I say!!!!!!!!!!!!11111
23:49  snover: draginx: of course it works
23:49  draginx: http://pastie.org/1293916 hmm
23:49  draginx: clicking on grid_view processes the console.log
23:49  draginx: but not the addClass hmm
23:49  ajpiano: draginx, in all browsers, or just mobile ?
23:50  draginx: both
23:50  draginx: browsers + mobile
23:50  ajpiano: can you make a jsfiddle pls then
23:50  ajpiano: that illustrates this issu
23:50  m0dmd: ajpiano i'm looking into that right now
23:51  draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/QgyWj/
23:52  draginx: ajpiano ^ that was for u
23:52  backinnam: anyone know how to bind events to non jQuery objects?
23:52  dilvie: snover: ideally, I agree with your solution. I would much rather fire a custom event -- but in this case, there's no logical place to emit the custom event, because I'm waiting on the browser to finish updating the select element -- not waiting on the script itself...
23:52  dilvie: kindof an odd situation.
23:53  coldhead: isn't jQuery mobile just jQuery with some mobile stuff?
23:53  draginx: coldhead: thats what i like to believe :S
23:53  snover: dilvie: huh?
23:54 --- snover is now known as snover|away
23:54  dilvie: snover: exactly.
23:58  coldhead: draginx: your events don't seem to be firing, i am guessing because of the <a>s within your buttony things that are trying to be all jquery mobiley with your links
23:58  ajpiano: draginx
23:58  ajpiano: here's what's happening
23:58  coldhead: unless you're seeing the console.logs firing
23:59  coldhead: you sound like adrian monk, ajpiano
23:59  coldhead: hi5
