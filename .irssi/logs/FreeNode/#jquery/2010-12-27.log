00:20  Figaroo: How would I do animations NOT on css?
00:21  Bartzy: width() costs anything ? It makes sense to 'cache' it in a variable if I use it more than once on the same element in a function ?
00:22  qq99: axel50397, your ajax version is missing a lot of css classes
00:22  qq99: axel50397, specifically, it only has the data-role attribute, missing class and role attribute entirely
00:23  axel50397: qq99: I've just discovered that if my links are "/blabla/dir/to/file.php", it works well =/
00:23  axel50397: instead of directely "file.php"... So, maybe I don't have to include the classes you're telling me ?
00:24  coldhead: Bartzy: it makes sense to cache it if you're going to reuse the value a lot, yes
00:24  Bartzy: colhead: Just twice, but thanks :)
00:24  qq99: axel50397, well, I know that the missing css classes are what's making the style not work, I don't know why your server would not be adding them in each case
00:24  coldhead: Figaroo: what do you want to animate?
00:24  pheuter: is there a way I can apply a 360 gradual rotation to a div ?
00:25  axel50397: qq99: The thing is that i've httrack'ed the jqm website... Doing the same :p
00:25  Bartzy: coldhead: On that subject, there's a plugin that does animation on 'left', so the animate function happens a lot. The jquery objects are not cached. Could that cause slow downs ?
00:25  coldhead: Bartzy: yes
00:25  Figaroo: coldhead, I want to animate a function
00:25  qq99: Bartzy, any call to jquery has to be evaluated, cache if it would make sense to
00:25  axel50397: qq99: One of my friend told me about "baseURL" but he doesn't know anything about js, so he just told me this :p. Is it something usefull ?
00:26  qq99: axel50397, what is 'httrack'?
00:26  Bartzy: coldhead: Could it cause slowdowns on stuff that are not connected to that animation at all ? A general slowdown of the page ?
00:26  axel50397: qq99: A website "hoover" ^^
00:26  dabear: ?source width: @ Bartzy
00:26  bot-t: Bartzy, Line#1056 - "div.innerHTML = "<div style='width:4px;'></div>";" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#1056
00:26  axel50397: Mirroring software
00:27  coldhead: Bartzy: very possibly. if you keep the browser busy doing the same lookups repeatedly that will slow things down
00:27  pheuter: anyone ?
00:27  coldhead: ?delay @ Figaroo
00:27  bot-t: Figaroo, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
00:27  dabear: ?source getWH @ Bartzy
00:27  bot-t: Bartzy, Line#5396 - "val = getWH( elem, name, extra );" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5396
00:27  dabear: so yeah it costs, cache it
00:28  qq99: axel50397, no idea, my only suggestion is make it so regardless of the type of request it will add those classes to the element
00:28  axel50397: qq99: Adding the classes myself ?
00:29  qq99: axel50397, no, I mean, your server obviously adds it fine in the non-AJAX case, so just find out why they aren't being added to the HTML in the ajax case
00:29  qq99: axel50397, if you're parsing the form from JSON or something I feel sorry for you :P
00:30  axel50397: Mmmmh....
00:30  pheuter: is it possible to rotate a div in jquery ?
00:30  Bartzy: thanks dabear and coldhead.
00:30  axel50397: Why are you talking about the server ? isn't it client-side ?
00:31  Figaroo: I don't get how to use .delay, isn't that just for delaying a jQuery animation?
00:31  qq99: Bartzy, even if you call .width twice, you should treat it like any other operation, and not assume anything about its running time.  like, you wouldn't say if (634 * 11) {...} then inside that, compute 634*11 again
00:32  Bartzy: qq99: Correct.
00:32  qq99: hard to think of an example, but if you call .width twice you're making the assumption that it's a cheap operation
00:32  Bartzy: thanks for the clarification..
00:32  coldhead: Figaroo: what do you mean animate, Figaroo ? i don't understand what you might want to animate that isn't CSS
00:32  Bartzy: I guess the question is where is the line between the overhead (there is any?) of saving a variable to memory and just calling a function...
00:33  Bartzy: But that's micro optimization
00:33  coldhead: Bartzy: the first rule of premature optimisation is don't
00:33  coldhead: and the second is use a profiler
00:33  ajpiano: Bartzy, rarelyis the memory cost of storing a vriable worse than any other alterrnative
00:34  ajpiano: that is why people create local references to global things
00:34  qq99: I can only think of it being a real problem if you have limited memory
00:34  ajpiano: function() {  var foo = window.document.foo.bar.baz;   foo; } is faster than looking up the scope chain
00:34  ajpiano: so
00:34  ajpiano: there you go
00:35  axel50397: So... qq99, thank you a lot for your help =)
00:35  axel50397: See you everybody !
00:36  qq99: gah
00:36  qq99: he left before I could finish typing
00:39  pheuter: is there a way to test if a link is valid in jQuery ?
00:39  Cork[home]: valid?
00:39  temp01: is it on the same domain?
00:39  pheuter: no
00:39  Cork[home]: you mean the target exist?
00:39  pheuter: right CoderForLife
00:39  levu: pheuter: if it's a link to an external domain, you can't because of the Same Origin Policy
00:39  pheuter: Cork[home] *
00:40  pheuter: even with jsonp ?
00:40  Cork[home]: jsnop only works with jsonp js files
00:41  coldhead: the SOP is racist
00:41  pheuter: SOP should die
00:41  Bartzy: How can I add variables inside a animate properties ?
00:41  Cork[home]: pheuter: sop is one of the few things keeping the web sain
00:41 --- snover|away is now known as snover
00:42  Bartzy: .animate({'width:'+my_var+'px'} ?
00:42  Cork[home]: BarryCarlyon: { value: var }
00:42  pheuter: by sain, you mean limited ?
00:42  Cork[home]: so .animate({width: my_var+'px'})
00:43  Cork[home]: pheuter: it would be dead simple for data to leak out of the page if you didn't have iut
00:43  Cork[home]: *it
00:43  Cork[home]: the attacks would never end
00:44  pheuter: yeah
00:44  Bartzy: Cork[home]: $tr_header.animate({width: new_tr_header_width + 'px'}); that doesn't do anything
00:45  Cork[home]: Bartzy: is new_tr_header_width a value?
00:45  Bartzy: nm my problem
00:45  Bartzy: thanks.
00:47 * templaedhel hates javascript data structure
00:48  Figaroo: coldhead: Here's an example of something I'd like to be able to do with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/ku2ce/
00:49  Figaroo: Using my custom built animation engine, I'm able to animate the function slide. Within slide can be any sort of code I wish, rendering the possibilities endless.
00:50  Figaroo: Can I do this in jQuery?
00:50  coldhead: i don't see what that is doing that setTimeout can't do
00:51  coldhead: it's my first day using jQuery sorry Figaroo
00:52  eoss: hello , i trying to place a website on the intrnet i have news for the internet i would like to share inside the internet
00:52  eoss: so what i do is create HTML DOCUMENT i clicked save
00:52  eoss: now what
00:52  Figaroo: coldhead, with setTimeout, I don't have the same level of control with playback. For example, I can pause, stop, play, scrub to specific postion, set the animation speed, and  loop the animation.
00:53  Figaroo: Also with setTimeout, I don't have any easing functions.
00:53  eoss: also does it matter my HTML document i saved it in a google doc, will it show up on my website?
00:53  ajpiano: eoss, please stop trolling
00:53  Figaroo: I'll probably just refine my animation engine and use that.
00:55  ben_alman: does anyone here use my debug.log console wrapper?
00:55  ajpiano: ben_alman, i've been known to
00:55  ben_alman: so i'm reworking the api
00:55  ben_alman: to be like, better
00:56  ajpiano: ok
00:56  ben_alman: do you ever set the logging level to anything other than 0?
00:56  ben_alman: like, do you set it to 4, for example, to allow logging but with no error logging?
00:56  ajpiano: i have never set that flag
00:56  ben_alman: do you ever disable logging, for production?
00:57  ajpiano: i try not to leave them in the first palce
00:57  ben_alman: so you just use them for dev logging
00:57  ben_alman: never in production
00:57  ajpiano: yea
00:57  ben_alman: ok
00:57  ben_alman: i'm trying to find someone other than me that uses them in production
00:58  ajpiano: not i :/
00:58 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:59  ben_alman: so right now, you can set the logging level
01:00  ben_alman: to leave all the debug statements in there but have it not log to console
01:00  ben_alman: in case you needed it in production
01:00  ben_alman: i'm thinking of making it slightly more intuitive
01:00  CoderForLife: you ping me, pheuter?

01:50  Anticom: hi all
01:53  Anticom: i am trying to code a UI, that enables me to create playlists via drag and drop
01:53  Anticom: http://anticom.dyndns.org/Streaming/dragtest/index.php
01:54  Anticom: now i am trying to keep the left box (drag from) as draggables, who's items revert to their original position unless they get dropped onto the right box (drag to)
01:54  Anticom: the right box should somehow convert them into a sortable
01:54  Anticom: but i have no idea how to do that
01:54  Anticom: can anyone help?
01:56  jrockjiggz: i seen a good example
01:56  Anticom: got a link?
01:56  jrockjiggz: wish i knew. it was just on jsfiddle
01:56  sie: If I select .some-class, then how could I get selected tag names?
01:56  Anticom: it should be somehow like on deezer.com
01:56  Anticom: but whith js instead of flash
01:56  sie: Whether it's a div, span or something else.
01:57  jrockjiggz: Anticom: drag list items from left and right.. maybe this might inspire you http://jsfiddle.net/JRGould/4bhcc/2/
01:57  sie: [0].tagName!
01:58  JRGould: how weird!
01:58  jrockjiggz: lol
01:58  jrockjiggz: yea i saved it....
01:58  jrockjiggz: ...
01:58  jrockjiggz: good stuff
01:58  Anticom: jrockjiggz thats not the big deal... my problem is, that the items on the left side should jump back into their position and (i'm not quite sure what exactly i would like to do, also depending on how easy it will be to do) either an instance of the item should be generated or the item should be moved to the right side, whenever it is dropped at the right container
01:59  JRGould: hah
02:00  jrockjiggz: Anticom: i also remember this example, the draggables will animate back to the last container if dragged outside http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/2USCm/47/
02:01  thebloggu: i have a div that whenever you hover it, it shows another one but the side. i would like for the latter not disappear whenever i get out of the first and enter the second. can someone help me?
02:02  Anticom: jrockjiggz yea, that's more like what i wanted
02:02  Anticom: maybe i can work with that
02:02  Anticom: thanks
02:03  jrockjiggz: Anticom: np
02:06 * Anticom is bookmarking this channel
02:06  Anticom: bye all
02:06  Anticom: and gn8
02:07  thebloggu: i have something like this (http://jsfiddle.net/H7L23/) and i want to, whenever i leave the img a, the right div goes away, except if it is on the right.

02:44  zakwilson: Does $('#a-form').submit(foo) replace a form's submit handler or append to it?
02:45  sie: snover, ;-D
02:46  snover: zakwilson: it works exactly the same as every other event handler
02:49  zakwilson: snover: a quick glance at the API docs suggests that event handlers append rather than replace. Since it sounds like you actually know the answer to this, will you confirm?

03:06  aidan: zakwilson: event.preventDefault to stop the form from submitting normally
03:09  zakwilson: aidan: I'd done that already. My problem was that I had buttons to switch the event handler, but I was actually adding more event handlers, creating somewhat unpredictable behavior.

08:01  Tallisman: morning tzy :P
08:02  tzy: by default, when we use jqueryui datepicker the date doesn't display on the text input on init.
08:02  tzy: how to make it display on init ?
08:02  jones-: Hello! Can somebody help me with this code? http://dpaste.com/291029/  It's supposed to be a dropdown menu but I observe some weird behaviour: often I need to click twice on a menu entry to have the dropdown, and often I observe a slideUp behaviour even though I only said "hide()". You can check it in action at the two orange buttons at http://astrobin.com/show/228/
08:02  jones-: thanks!
08:02  tzy: so that user doesn't have to click on the text input and select the date.
08:07  Tallisman: Wookie, did you ever use the jqueryui datepicker?
08:09  Tallisman: I see jones-, your slide doesn't work correctly when clicking view and after that actions, or the other way around

08:12  wookiehangover: I have in the past, I'm no expert on it though
08:12  tzy: wookiehangover: how to make datepicker display date on the textinput on init ?
08:13  tzy: by default we need to select it by clicking the textinput.
08:15  wookiehangover: so, you want the date to be in the input before they choose one
08:16  tzy: kinda...
08:16  _nix00: ls
08:16  nigelb: tzy: you mean you want the date picker already visible when the page loads?
08:16  wookiehangover: so like today's date?
08:16  tzy: wookiehangover: yes
08:17  tzy: nigelb: the datepicker should be visible, just the date itself not appears on the textinput

08:19  jguzikowski: YourNameHere: If you'd like to PM me I can tell you the details and you could give me a quote, goes for anyone who's interested
08:19  YourNameHere: ok
08:20  tzy: nigelb: you mean this http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#inline ?
08:20  nigelb: tzy: yep, exactly that

08:22  YourNameHere: jguzikowski, I PM'ed you
08:22  tzy: nigelb: what i want is rather simpler...like the default: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#default
08:22  tzy: just that the text input will display today date.
08:23  nigelb: tzy: just do it server side then
08:23  nigelb: probably php or whatever you're using
08:23  tzy: nigelb: can't do it with the datepicker /
08:24  tzy: ?
08:24  jguzikowski: YourNameHere: Thanks, responded.
08:25  tzy: nigelb: because i have defaultDate: -7
08:27  nigelb: tzy: not sure if datepicker can do that bit.  but you could just use normal js
08:27 --- dytrivedi_ is now known as dytrivedi
08:28  nigelb: tzy: try $(".date-pick").datepicker('setDate', new Date());
08:31  tzy: nigelb:doesn't seems to work :(
08:32  nigelb: tzy: It just worked for me
08:32  nigelb: tzy: did you put it after the date picker was initialized?
08:33  nigelb: !paste
08:33  nigelb: no pastebin? :(

08:39  nigelb: tzy: err http://jsfiddle.net/VvvBB/2/
08:42  iszak: Tallisman, because match returns an array
08:42  tzy: nigelb: yeah...it works
08:42  iszak: you probably want /regex/.test(string)
08:42  tzy: nigelb: btw, what's the diff $(document).ready and what i used originally ?
08:42  Tallisman: O.O
08:42  Tallisman: thanks iszak ^^
08:42  iszak: Tallisman, what are you trying to do anyway?
08:42  tzy: i follow the documentation.
08:43  Tallisman: i did not quite know that.. trying to check if a entered value is correct :P
08:43  nigelb: tzy: because you want it to populate the field when the page is loaded.
08:43  iszak: Tallisman, make sure the username only contains a-z, 0-9, underscores and hyphens?
08:43  Tallisman: no illegal charracters and stuff
08:43  Tallisman: yep
08:43  iszak: Tallisman, in which case you need to use start and end of line anchors.
08:43  iszak: otherwise "!@abc" will be true.
08:43  Tallisman: oh, yea you're right ^^
08:43  Tallisman: ^$

12:02  hendry: $('li').first().css('background-color', 'red') works, but $('li').first().val() // doesn't, how do I get the value of a list item?

12:03  BinaryKitten: urm
12:03  BinaryKitten: list items don't have a value
12:03  BinaryKitten: hendry what are you after exactly?
12:04  iszak: hendry, .val() only works on form elements.
12:04  iszak: hendry, e.g. inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc, not so much list items.
12:04  iszak: hendry, you probably want .html() or even .text().

12:11  Rovanion: Is it so that HTML objects added with .append do not get their own objects in jQuery?
12:13  Trim: can anybody tell me if newest versions changed sth about accordion api ? each time i call this fucntion it breaks whole js :) it happend after i updatedfiles
12:14  Cork[home]: 1.8.7?
12:14  Trim: y
12:15  Cork[home]: what fails?
12:16  Trim: i have cycles and slider on site and 2 acordions on subpages, but each time i put acoocrdion funcotion cycle and silder don`t load, even accordion is not working :)
12:17  Trim: i was wondering if i should separate them in different temlates (due to cms) bt how possibily it can affect js if funcions are togetehr or not, i keep them in single placeholder
12:17  Cork[home]: that shouldn't matter
12:18  Cork[home]: i've hit an animation bug in 1.8.7 thats why i asked http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6748
12:18  Cork[home]: might be another bug your seeing, you would have to dig in a bit
12:19  Trim: i`m gonna download 1.7 and check it it helps, it should clear case a bit
12:19  Cork[home]: try 1.8.6 first
12:21  Rovanion: Is it so that HTML objects added with .append do not get their own objects in jQuery? I'm having trouble accessing the objects I just .append():ed trough $('.apeendedClass')
12:24  Cork[home]: Rovanion: you have to append them to the dom first; as long as you do that it should work fine
12:24  Rovanion: Cork[home], And how do I do that?
12:25  Cork[home]: $parent.append('<div class="new_elem">text</div'); $('.new_elm').text()
12:25  Cork[home]: + the missing > :)
12:26  Rovanion: Cork[home], Thank you, that will probably do it !
12:26  Cork[home]: Rovanion: or you can save a ref to the element before you append it
12:26  Rovanion: Cork[home], Show me how
12:27  Cork[home]: var $newElm = $('<div class="new_elem">text</div>'); $parent.append($newElm); $newElm.text()
12:27  Cork[home]: (you can even scip the append if you like)
12:27  Cork[home]: (it won't be visible on the page until you do that though)
12:27  m_e: i guess noone from jqplot here?

12:32  m_e: hm yea but might be a bit too heavy... i only want charts... and found jqplot easy to use
12:32  m_e: the only problem i have is that i am having this bug: http://image-upload.de/get/0Gy7QJ/4ea80e57f1.jpg the number on the highes bar doesnt show
12:33  Cork[home]: didn't mean it as use it instead ^^'
12:33  Cork[home]: but it uses svg instead of canvas so it scale
12:33  Cork[home]: thats why i picked it
12:34  m_e: Cork[home]: hehe ok... but still i guess if i ask ppl they would suggest me 10 different plugins for drawing things... i already set jqplot up and would like to use it ;)
12:34  m_e: just that stupid bug remaining :(
12:35  Cork[home]: m_e: check if they have a forum or something
12:39  Dirkos: How can i check how many sub divs there are in a div?
12:40  sac_: $('yourdivselector').find('div').length
12:40  sac_: if you want direct children, use children instead of find
12:40  sac_: or $('div', 'yourdivselector').length that works too

13:18  Tallisman: everything below 12 isn't.
13:19  Cork[home]: /^[A-Z]{12}$/i.test(key)
13:20  Cork[home]: you have to match the complete string

13:39  egsome: SugaSlide, But why not set automatically ?
13:39  egsome: Cork[home], Any demo or beta ?
13:39  SugaSlide: it reads how wide the origional select is

13:41  sean`: for the original*
13:41  SugaSlide: its the css
13:41  SugaSlide: so not totaly theme roller
13:41  sean`: I mean
13:42  SugaSlide: since its using a custom hover etc
13:42  sean`: does it do $select.trigger ('change'
13:42  SugaSlide: not theme roller hovrer
13:42  SugaSlide: hmm
13:42  SugaSlide: ye
13:42  sean`: to keep events bound to it by other scripts alive
13:42  SugaSlide: i think
13:42  SugaSlide: $("#dID").selectmenu().change(
13:42  SugaSlide: that type of thing?
13:42  sean`: no
13:42  sean`: 				this.element.trigger("change");

13:45  SugaSlide: sean` i suck at seeing words describing code
13:45  Cork[home]: egsome: i used button long before it was stable, and i had to hack on it quite a bit at first
13:45  SugaSlide: if you do a $("dID").binf("change", it will fire
13:45  kwame: but my forms are submitted even when nothing has been typed into the input fields and text area
13:45  SugaSlide: bind*
13:45  sean`: SugaSlide, you should comment your code
13:45  sean`: for future stuff
13:45  SugaSlide: bleh
13:45  sean`: and to make others understand your code
13:46  egsome: Cork[home], Same here, I also had to modify some of it's CSS Propertied to work well
13:46  Cork[home]: ya
13:46  SugaSlide: lol no one would want to understand my code :P

13:47  SugaSlide: alot of the stuff has changed drasticaly in the last 2 days
13:47  Hopsy: mhh, i am gonna try to print something lol
13:47  sean`: so
13:47  sean`: put them back

13:48  SugaSlide: i will soon enough.. just got a bug
13:48  SugaSlide: with optgroups
13:48  sean`: well
13:48  sean`: SugaSlide, main reason people comment their code si for understanding and efficiency
13:48  Hopsy: :p
13:48  sean`: If you go through your code and understand it, you will also see the options to improve it
13:49  sean`: 'cause commenting == analysing

14:56  rethus: but if the layers change, they shown shortly below each other
14:56  rethus: why
14:56  rethus: try to use this example: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tabs/slideshow.htm
14:56  Chadams: they are two different sizes
14:57  Chadams: I mean
14:57  Chadams: when the second div appears
14:57  Echoes: rethus: before you fade the new one in
14:57  Chadams: it is put under the previous one
14:57  Echoes: make sure you hide() the one before it first
14:58  Echoes: or sort relative positioning out and z-index
14:58  Chadams: Echoes: I  think he wants to cross fade
14:58  rethus: yes, crossfading
14:58  Chadams: you will need to make each div position:absolute
14:58  rethus: on the example-page it works, i wonder why not on my page... even its copy and paste
14:58  Chadams: so they overlay
14:58  Echoes: oh in that case, rethus make each div absolute positioned in a relative positioned container
14:58  Chadams: this is a CSS problem, not a jquery problem
14:58  Echoes: Chadams: ya

15:02  rethus: Chadams: thanks, i'll try this
15:02  felipe23: i' playing around with rails 3 and ujs
15:02  felipe23: and i happened to find something in javascript/jquery i don't understand
15:02  felipe23: http://pastie.org/1408538
15:02  jomofcw: Jquery Tools, it's just an other UI, like jQuery UI, right ?
15:03  Dracos__: no, it's not
15:03  felipe23: if i apply an onClick handler to a jquery-object i can either call a function directly
15:03  Dracos__: jquery tools clobbers other plugins
15:03  jomofcw: felipe23 you forget the function(){} in the second example
15:03  felipe23: or i can define an anonymous function inside the bind method
15:03  felipe23: that's the question
15:03  jomofcw: Dracos__ hi :) OK so that's just a "compilation" of plugin ?
15:04  felipe23: i could call some function directly like alert("bla")
15:04  jomofcw: felipe23 that's not "you can" but "you have to"
15:04  felipe23: but i can't seem to pass the event object into another function
15:04  jomofcw: felipe23 because it's a function
15:04  felipe23: only works with an anonymous function
15:04  Dracos__: jquery tools is a collection of plugins
15:04  jomofcw: alert("bla") is a fnction like function(){}
15:04  Dracos__: ui is much better
15:05  Chadams: in second example "felipe" it's returning a JQ object
15:05  felipe23: hmm, no i can also call a function without function()
15:05  Chadams: not a finction
15:05  felipe23: but i can't pass in the event object as a parameter
15:05  Chadams: toggleSpinner gets called "before" the bind
15:05  jomofcw: felipe23 th'tas what I said :x
15:05  felipe23: this only works with the function()-wrapper
15:06  jomofcw: felipe23, in then anonymous function "this" will be the event element.
15:06  Chadams: your not passing a finction in the second example, your executing the toggleSpinner function and then passign the result JQuery object into the bind last
15:06  felipe23: ok then where's the difference between bla.click(alert("blabla") and bla.click(function(){alert("blabla")}))
15:06  jomofcw: the element from which one the event was fired
15:06  rethus: Chadams: thanks a lot, work now
15:07  jomofcw: felipe23 I don't understand what YOU don't understand :(
15:07  jomofcw: So can't help...
15:07  felipe23: the difference between bla.click(alert("blabla" and bla.click(function( alert("blabla") ))))
15:08  felipe23: sry i mean function(){ alert("blabla")}
15:09  felipe23: i can't do bla.click(alert(event)) but i can do bla.click(function(event){ alert(event)})
15:09  felipe23: why can't i pass the event-object directly into a function instead of wrapping an anonymous function around

15:22  BinaryKitten: cojack what you need is to overwride your form's isValid
15:23  asdf2345: hello
15:23  BinaryKitten: check to see if the required one is set then you remove the requirement for the other
15:23  BinaryKitten: or something similar
15:23  cojack: huh, thats make sense
15:23  BinaryKitten: then you call the parent::isValid
15:23  BinaryKitten: passing in the data
15:23  asdf2345: i get the following error and i need a little help interpreting it
15:24  asdf2345: Error: $(".radio").dgStyle is not a function
15:24  cojack: BinaryKitten: thanks
15:24  BinaryKitten: urm
15:24  cojack: Echoes and webben u also
15:24  asdf2345: because my include file is there that would allow said function to exist
15:24  BinaryKitten: oh wait
15:24  BinaryKitten: cojack sorry
15:24  cojack: ?
15:24  SugaSlide: any ideas why var data = $this.children line doesnt work? http://fixee.org/paste/blh9cwa/
15:24  BinaryKitten: i thouht I was looking at the ZFTalk channel
15:24  asdf2345: that only thing i can think is that maybe my jquery version was updated
15:25  BinaryKitten: which means that my suggestion is not valid
15:25  cojack: hahaha ;p
15:25  BinaryKitten: sorry
15:25  BinaryKitten: it is valid for Zend_Form though
15:25  cojack: np dude, but your idea have some right to my problem
15:25  BinaryKitten: that's cool
15:25  cojack: and now I know how to make it
15:25  SugaSlide: lol
15:26  BinaryKitten: please do blog your results
15:26  BinaryKitten: share your solution so that others might learn
15:26  cojack: BinaryKitten: I do, cojack.pl ;]
15:27  cojack: but I have no time now for writting, to bussy
15:27  BinaryKitten: ah please make a note to blog about it if you get successful result
15:28  cojack: np, at weekend I will

16:02  codemanki: Hey! I have a page, which does jquery.ajax -> loads html and tries to inject it in html. but the problem, that javascript which is in that ajax html, doesn't execute properly. Even if i am using .load() instead of .ajax. Maybe there is  some other way to require html+js from server and execute+inject it in existing page?
16:02  Michael: We need a bot help for this issue
16:03  asdf2345: i know my last question was vague but are there some avenues i can explore that some of you more experienced jquery writers might be able to suggest?
16:03  ajpiano: codemanki, if you have a block of html and script tags, when you insert that whole thing into the dom, it *should* execute the scripts
16:04  ajpiano: asdf2345, you have to check if all your scritps are still being found and loaded, etc.
16:04  asdf2345: first thing i checked
16:04  asdf2345: they seem to be in there
16:04  ajpiano: mm, seem to be
16:04  asdf2345: in the source of said page
16:04  codemanki: well, it executes in some strange way. the usual <script>alert('blabla');</script> doesn't execute at all...but it executes js which is located in files which are inserted in that html %)
16:04  ajpiano: codemanki http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/E78F3/light/
16:05  ajpiano: script is executed unless you use .load("url selector")
16:06  ajpiano: codemanki, in general though, gttting hunks of script and html is a bad practise if you can avoid it
16:06  codemanki: yes, completely agree, but i am on rails framework and it is dumping data into js
16:06  codemanki: ajpiano: and is there difference between .load and .ajax(dataType:"html")?
16:06  codemanki: i mean, which one is more preferable ?
16:07  ajpiano: load simply takes care of the insertion of content for you
16:07  codemanki: so, it is like alias for .ajax ?
16:07  ajpiano: yes, you can look in the source to see that
16:07  JenniferB2: Hi folks.. i have an element at the bottom of the page i want the browser to scroll to but so that the element appears at the bottom of the browser windwo.. that is, not the scroll the top part of the window to the element .. but the bottom part... any ideas?
16:08  codemanki: ajpiano: tnx, will continue investigation
16:08  JenniferB2: probably hard to undestand what I just wrote.. but let me rephrase
16:08  SugaSlide: jenifer probably work out the ehight of your content
16:08  SugaSlide: height
16:08  SugaSlide: then use something like scrollTo
16:08  SugaSlide: height of content - window height
16:09 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
16:10  serio_: you don't need to use a plugin to animate $( 'body, html' );
16:11  BinaryKitten: no but the scrollTo plugin makes it so easy
16:11  JenniferB2: yeah.. unfortunately it seems as if its more calculation needed... i need to window.scrollTo the element.. minus the element height, minus the rest of area visible under that element...
16:12  serio_: you just get the offset of the element you want to scrollTo
16:12  SugaSlide: $(document).height() - $(window).height()
16:13  JenniferB2: SugaSlide: that might work.. i will report in a while :)
16:13  serio_: var targetOffset = $target.offset().top; $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: targetOffset}, 1000);
16:13  serio_: ^^
16:14  l4rk: why not just scrollTop on the window?
16:15  Dirkos: I have a problem with my events. How can i cancel the current event that is running?
16:15  ThiefMaster: what's the best way to iterate over a huge object (~20k keys) without hanging the browser during that iteration? with an array i'd simply store next the index and continue with that one in a 1ms setTimeout.. but unfortunately objects don't have numeric indices
16:16  BinaryKitten: event.preventDefault();
16:16  Dirkos: The code is actually running 1 event, running the 2nd one on top of it but because it goes that fast he does not have time to close the first event
16:16  BinaryKitten: event is passed as a paremeter to the callback function
16:16  ajpiano: Dirkos, you need to use 'debouncing' technique
16:16  JenniferB2: l4rk: because I am trying to scroll not the top part of the window to the element .. but the bottom part of it
16:16  JenniferB2: serio: not sure what that does..
16:17  ajpiano: Dirkos http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
16:17  serio_: ?tias

16:17  SugaSlide: http://server.zoutnet.co.za/william/select/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js help needed in the ----- HELP ---- section.. any ideas?
16:17  Dirkos: ajpiano: the thing is it happens with onmouse events
16:18  ajpiano: Dirkos, http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/throttle/ also
16:18  ajpiano: Dirkos, why don't you try implementing the techniq
16:18  ajpiano: it works for many different tpyes of events
16:18  faraway: ThiefMaster: you could split iteration by e.g. iterate over 200 elements, then call a callback via the setTimout iterate over the next 200 element setTimout,and so on until you reached the end of the list
16:18  ThiefMaster: yes, that's what i want to do
16:18  ThiefMaster: i don't see a good way to do that with an object (not an array!) though
16:18  Dirkos: yeah im checking :) just want to know that its the "problem"
16:18  Gelegrod1n: someone know why the appended data appears at top? http://jsfiddle.net/jmU3Z/8/
16:19  ajpiano: Dirkos, are you trying to do a hover thing?
16:19  iszak: ThiefMaster, how hard is it?
16:19  jeffsmykil: Is there a pre-made mapping solution for jquery using SVG?
16:19  Dirkos: yeah its a hover / opacity thing
16:19  ThiefMaster: what do you mean iszak?
16:19  ajpiano: ?fix hover @ Dirkos
16:19  bot-t: Dirkos, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using doTimeout (http://bit.ly/12WSwE). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
16:19  l4rk: ThiefMaster: iterating over that many items is not recommended
16:19  iszak: ThiefMaster, use gt/lt => each => end => gt/lt => each, wtf?
16:19  iszak: s/wtf/etc/
16:19  ThiefMaster: it's not a jquery object but a regular object (from an ajax response)
16:20  ajpiano: ThiefMaster, you would just set your own iterator variable and incremnt it
16:20  iszak: oh I see.
16:20  Dirkos: thnx
16:20  iszak: that's going to be fun :)
16:20  l4rk: just iterating an object with that many keys shouldn't hang the browser
16:20  l4rk: what are you currently doing
16:21  ajpiano: l4rk, for each key, he creates 2000 dom elements
16:21  ajpiano: then when the browser is good n' dead
16:21  ajpiano: he kicks it in the chin
16:21  l4rk: damnnnn
16:21  ajpiano: and insults its mother
16:21  iszak: most browsers can handle that shit.
16:21  ThiefMaster: well i'm creating html elements for each element.. the object i'm iterating over it is a playlist so for every song in it i create a <li>
16:21  iszak: only if you're on IE or a 400 MHz PC.

16:22  BinaryKitten: ThiefMaster create the parent Item, loop, append to parentItem, Insert parentItem into dom
16:22  ThiefMaster: aw, that sucks
16:22  ajpiano: you just need to minimise your dom touches
16:23  ThiefMaster: ah
16:23  Gelegrod1n: ThiefMaster: do a big var and append too the dom outside of the loop
16:23  ThiefMaster: so creating the item is fine, just not appending it to the document itself
16:23  Gelegrod1n: yes
16:23  Gelegrod1n: do that ONCE
16:23  Gelegrod1n: after the loop
16:23  BinaryKitten: Gelegrod1n ewww @ "big var"
16:23  Gelegrod1n: BinaryKitten: well.. he understands :)

16:32  Gelegrod1n: webben: well problem is the appended row (the one with the highest age) always appers at top, but it should be at bottom..
16:32  ThiefMaster: especially stuff like .toggleClass('blacklist', song.blacklist) horribly sucks when just creating strings... (song.blacklist ? 'class="blcklist"' : '') or something similar is so much less readable

16:33  Gelegrod1n: webben: its kinda old so.. i guess its possible
16:33  ThiefMaster: ajpiano: a bit
16:33  ajpiano: asdf2345, that syntax is defining a function as a property of an object, known as a method
16:33  SugaSlide: ?

16:33  asdf2345: ok

16:52  muhdik: hi
16:52  hobs: thats an interesting bind
16:52  muhdik: whats the difference between $ajax and $post
16:52  serio_: NOTHING
16:52  ajpiano: muhdik, $.post is a convenience method that calls $.ajax
16:52  ThiefMaster: $.ajax has a nicer/cleaner interface imo
16:53  muhdik: does $.post have traditional?
16:53  serio_: traditional what?
16:53  muhdik: i mena i need to send a list of checked boxes
16:53  muhdik: that are checked
16:53  ajpiano: muhdik, $.ajax gives you more granularity to set options, etc.
16:53  muhdik: hte ides back
16:53  muhdik: the ids back to the server
16:53  ajpiano: you can't set the traditional flag if you're using $.post, only $.ajax
16:54  rethus1: can someone tell me how to use this "interval"  parameter ? :http://flowplayer.org/tools/tabs/slideshow.html
16:54  muhdik: traditional is what you need to send a list of checked ids back to the server?
16:54  ajpiano: i don't know, you're the one who asked about the traditional flag
16:54  sean`: ?define granularity
16:54  bot-t: sean`, granularity - (noun) The condition of being granular.
16:54  rethus1: i add it to this function: $(".slidetabs").tabs(".images > div", {, but take no effect
16:55  rethus1: in the example-sourcecode on this page i read:
16:55  rethus1: // use the slideshow plugin. It accepts its own configuration. but what is the slieshow plugin they spoke about here?
16:55  rethus1: isn't it that from this page?
16:56  serio_: ajpiano, any relation to Susan Sontag?
16:56  ajpiano: nope
16:56  serio_: or are there like a BILLION Sontags
16:56  ajpiano: not a billion
16:57  ajpiano: it was a randomly assigned last name to jews in germany in the late 19th century
16:57  serio_: I said LIKE a billion
16:57  serio_: really?
16:57  serio_: interesting
16:57  ajpiano: yea
16:57  ajpiano: all days of the week
16:57  ajpiano: hence why you see sontags and montags and freitags etc
16:58  Brodingo: whatd you get for Chanukah
16:58  ajpiano: jews only had patronymic names so they were like, damn, y'all need surnames

16:59  Brodingo: yeah i didnt get anything for Chanukah
16:59  SugaSlide: YES PLEASE!!! its working again :D

17:00  Brodingo: i got a cat and a ps3
17:00  muhdik: how do i get a list of checked checkboxes in jquery?
17:00  Brodingo: :checked
17:00  serio_: ?checkboxes
17:00  bot-t: To set a checkbox to checked, do .attr("checked","checked"). To uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked"). To check if it's checked or not: .is(":checked");
17:00  ajpiano: muhdik $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function()  { return this.id; }).join()
17:00  SugaSlide: i didnt get anything for christmas except shouted at :/
17:00  serio_: awes
17:00  muhdik: ok
17:01  serio_: SugaSlide, you're story is like A Wonderful Life, execpt in your version you simply jump
17:02  SugaSlide: lol
17:02  pietia: what's better .replaceWith or .html ?
17:02  ajpiano: pietia, what's better, an apple, or a candy bar
17:02  Brodingo: pretty grim
17:02  ajpiano: neither
17:02  muhdik: ajpiano instead of return this.id i want to send it back to the server as a list?
17:02  ajpiano: sometimes you want an apple, sometimes you want a candy bar
17:02  Brodingo: well apples are better for you
17:03  ajpiano: muhdik, no, you're building the list in that step
17:03  serio_: I always want a candy bar.
17:03  rethus1: how can i slow down this animation (http://www.erfolgsbeginn.de/basis/front_content.php?idart=29) with parm "intervall" (http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tabs/slideshow.html) ? i don't get it?
17:03  ajpiano: then that entire expression returns a string, which you then send to the server
17:03  Brodingo: what about apple candy
17:03  rethus1: seems to be always 3 sekonds
17:03  SugaSlide: i always want your mom
17:03  pietia: ajpiano, so what's the difference?
17:03  ajpiano: pietia, i'm assuming you've already read the manual
17:03  ajpiano: and failed to understand the difference?
17:03  ajpiano: uh, ok
17:04  serio_: haha
17:04  serio_: 'k thnx bye!'
17:04  Brodingo: he probably went to the store to buy some apples and candy bars and do some research
17:04  muhdik: ajpiano so where does the list get saved at?
17:04  ajpiano: muhdik var foo = $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function()  { return this.id; }).join()
17:04  serio_: maybe pietia figured the internet out after all.
17:04  rethus1: sorry, parm interval is descriped here: http://flowplayer.org/tools/tabs/slideshow.html
17:05  muhdik: oh ok cool
17:05  ajpiano: muhdik var foo = $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function()  { return this.id; }).get.()join()
17:05  SugaSlide: whats the normal crap comments that people place at the top of their plugins? anyone got an eg at hand or must i look at other plugins :P
17:05  ajpiano: omg
17:05  rethus1: i don't see,how to use this parm on that sliedhow-plugin
17:05  serio_: everything is explained everywhere
17:05  serio_: especially here.
17:05  ajpiano: muhdik, i keep having typos, sorry:  var foo = $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function()  { return this.id; }).get().join()
17:06  serio_: how is that a typeo?

17:09  Jarda: serio_: what's wrong with jquery tools?
17:10  ajpiano: rethus1, from looking at the docs, interval does not slow down the animation
17:10  muhdik: hi
17:10  fruitwerks: lazy load anyone?
17:10  ajpiano: it sets the amount of time between automatic slide changes
17:10  rethus1: ajpiano: i know, i need that each tab stay for 5 sekonds
17:10  ajpiano: interval:5000
17:10  muhdik: is there a reason that in chrome when i refresh the page checkboxes get unchecked but in firefox they stay checked?
17:10  rethus1: ajpiano: thats not work
17:11  serio_: it should bro
17:11  rethus1: therfor i ask here, where to place the parameter

17:15  trevatwork: I have a submit button that I want to trigger a dialog box.  I don't want the parent form's submit action to actually happen until the box is closed.  what's a good way to do this?
17:15  serio_: you're using a comma before adding in the additional param, right?
17:15  trevatwork: essentially I want to pause the submission of a form until another action happens
17:16  ajpiano: trevatwork, don' think of it as pausing
17:16  ajpiano: you need to cancel the event outright
17:16  ajpiano: and then trigger it again when the dialog closest
17:16  ajpiano: -t
17:16  trevatwork: ajpiano: yeah so do I unbind the submit button's click and then trigger parent form submit on dialog close?
17:16  ajpiano: no
17:16  serio_: now that's a typo!
17:16  serio_: :D
17:16  ajpiano: you can just event.preventDefault(()
17:17  trevatwork: ajpiano: what's the event in this case tho?
17:17  ajpiano: the submit event?
17:17  serio_: submit
17:17  serio_: $( 'form' ).bind( 'submit', function( e ) { e.preventDefault() } );
17:18  trevatwork: ajpiano, serio_: so could I put prevent default in the submit button's click event though?
17:18  ajpiano: no
17:18  serio_: do it on the form
17:18  ajpiano: you need to bind to the submit event on the form
17:18  ajpiano: and cancel that
17:18  trevatwork: ajpiano: ok cool -- thanks. i'll try that out

17:30  erichynds: no clue
17:30  ajpiano: no
17:30  serio_: that's just like, you get to the bottom of the page
17:30  ajpiano: it's just an infinite scroll

17:30  serio_: yeah
17:30  erichynds: i apparently have no idea what lazy loading means then
17:30  serio_: and I think it's specifically for wordpress too
17:30  serio_: lawl

17:31  serio_: dude, we know
17:31  serio_: we know what it is
17:31  fruitwerks: just making sure :)

17:31  serio_: shiiet
17:33  serio_: fruitwerks, you don't really need the ajax part
17:33  serio_: unless you want to kill the fallback
17:33  rethus1:  serio_: thanks, but can i use this slideshow even with normal div-layers instead of images?

17:36  Brodingo: fruitwerks what do you consider low?
17:37  fruitwerks: like 1024 and below
17:38  serio_: are you actually scalling them down dynamically?
17:39  serio_: like, with PHP img libs or something?

17:39  serio_: cuz that sounds really really taxing in my mind.

17:39  fruitwerks: yeah with php and stuff
17:40  serio_: ajpiano, right on topic as always
17:40  serio_: I should follow your ass.
17:40  serio_: fruitwerks, honestly
17:41  serio_: that sounds like a fools errand
17:41  fruitwerks: I can't have images flying off the page
17:42  Brodingo: img max-width
17:43  ajpiano: so why not just constrain the dimensionson the client side
17:43  ajpiano: instead of atually generating new images
17:43  serio_: I think that's what we'd all suggest
17:44  fruitwerks: because if they are shrunk down so much, they will be clickable to load the fullsize one if they want more detail
17:44  fruitwerks: so what is 'everyone' suggesting?
17:44  serio_: ok
17:44  serio_: are these image being uploaded?
17:44  danheberden: ajpiano: serio reminds me of the sites with the 2mb image forced to a viewable size on the homebrew site, lol
17:44  serio_: cuz like, that's when you should generate the thumb
17:44  danheberden: withe the filename DSC0012.jpg
17:45  ajpiano: wat?!
17:45  serio_: wat?! indeed.
17:45  danheberden: whenever my gf sends me, like, a site to lookup of like a dog to maybe buy, the iamges are always straight from the dig. camera
17:45  danheberden: or i find compnay websites sometimes
17:45  serio_: and I remind you of that?
17:45  danheberden: the 'just resize it client side' did
17:46  danheberden: meant for lol's kiddos
17:46  danheberden: no need to panic
17:46  serio_: the ideal solution would be so size the images down after they're uploaded, for sure.
17:47  fruitwerks: *sigh*
17:47  serio_: or just force a filesize on the uploaded content
17:47  danheberden: oh i'm sorry fruitwerks

18:18  jqueryusr: Hi, I have an jQuery $.ajax requests which usually works, but when the response is bigger (a few MBs), then I see the reply OK on firebug, but the "success" or "failure" callbacks in jQuery aren't being called
18:18  jqueryusr: any ideas ?
18:19  RTPMatt: that is a big ass ajax return
18:20  jqueryusr: yeah, but how can i figure out whats going on, why isn't jquery working..
18:20  EpiphanyG: too big a response perhaps :P
18:21  jqueryusr: is this a known limitation ?
18:21  jqueryusr: is it an issue with jQuery ? (since firebug shows the response ok in the NET window)
18:21  jqueryusr: where can i read about the limits of ajax requests like this ?
18:21  kolor: may be the request timeouts by jquery
18:21  kolor: and it removes callback
18:22  kolor: but browser still gets the data
18:22  kolor: look into source of jquery
18:22  snover: jqueryusr: stop returning multiple MBs of data.
18:22  snover: jqueryusr: if you are sending that much data in an AJAX request, you are doing it wrong
18:22  ajpiano: or returnin git
18:22  jqueryusr: that cannot be done for now
18:23  jqueryusr: kolor: when timeout happens doesn't the failure callback get calel ?

18:23  snover: jqueryusr: what version of jquery are you trying to use?

18:24  EpiphanyG: what is parsing it? (out of interest)
18:24  kolor:  if ( isTimeout === "timeout" ) { xhr.abort(); }
18:24  kolor: thats jquery
18:24  jqueryusr: EpiphanyG: i am parsing it
18:24  snover: jqueryusr: are you sure? does the response validate at http://jsonlint.com ?
18:24  jqueryusr: kolor: what's the default timeout setting ?
18:25  jqueryusr: snover: it works perfectly when the data is the same, just smaller
18:26  jqueryusr: kolor: the code also does jQuery.handleError( s, xhr, status, errMsg );
18:26  jqueryusr: yet i don't get the failure callback ..
18:27  kolor: why dont u use some iframe for so big data
18:27  jqueryusr: also the default is timeout = 0
18:27  jqueryusr: which means it's disabled (as far as i can gather from viewing jquery source)
18:27  jqueryusr: i rather if possible figure out whats the size limitation and where it's happening for now
18:28  jqueryusr: since this is the codebase that is used, and besides the usual "dont send so much information", i want to figure out where the limit / problem is
18:28  snover: jqueryusr: you’re almost certainly exhausting the regex engine’s stack space
18:28  kolor: probably  its when parsing regexp
18:28  kolor: json
18:29  snover: there is literally nothing that jQuery can do to fix that for you
18:29  kolor: try transfering it in text
18:29  kolor: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/898477/ajax-request-browser-limit
18:29  jqueryusr: i am doing the parsing with a call to eval it
18:29  snover: ugh

18:39  ajpiano: jqueryusr, if you have a nested json structure, jquery should be parsing the entire structure, not just...parts of it
18:39  jqueryusr: ajpiano: iis returns the json obj in "d" ?
18:39 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 85 seconds
18:39  snover: you’re doing it wrong.
18:39  jqueryusr: what should i do then ?
18:41  snover: read the documentation for whatever thing you are using on the server
18:41  snover: which clearly wants an object of some sort to be passed but instead you are sending it a json string
18:41  snover: then
18:41  jqueryusr: it's some sort of security measure of IIS i belive
18:41  snover: fix your code so that it is not sending MBs of data
18:41  snover: that makes no sense.
18:41  snover: there is nothing secure about double-serializing data.
18:41  snover: in fact, it’s *dangerous*, because the double-serialized data is potentially not actually a JSON string and could execute arbitrary code
18:41  snover: etc etc.
18:41  snover: tl;dr UR DOIN IT WRANG
18:41  RTPMatt: jqueryusr: i believe you need to pass a straight object back from IIS, and you are probably passing a string back instead
18:41  jqueryusr: sec, i'll find it
18:42  kolor: if you pass json from server, especially with headers json -> jquery parses it automatically, and chokes on eval BEFORE callback is called
18:42  snover: ?tijnh @ jqueryusr
18:42  bot-t: jqueryusr, This is #jquery, not #handholding.
18:42  jqueryusr: yeah yeah...
18:42  snover: please figure it out yourself at this point, we’ve told you what is wrong and how you can fix it :)
18:42  jqueryusr: as i said, it works perfectly with small ammoutns of data
18:42  kolor: set breakpoint on jquery ajax function and trace it yourself
18:42  snover: And I already said why it’s wrong, and why it breaks
18:43  jqueryusr: kolor: yeah i guess i'll be doing it, just wanted to know if this is a known issue
18:43  jqueryusr: (googling didn't help too much)

19:08  BrandonE: kolor: The main thing is the positioning. I can easily create the individual shapes. It's all about how to format them one on top of the other. Divs do that automatically

19:34  BrandonE: kolor: Sorry, was afk. So, the first step would be creating a canvas element with a brick for each size, a base, and a peg? We can work on positioning after?
19:34  ajpiano: Alan502, why are you including jQuery twic
19:34  ajpiano: Alan502, you don't have to include a separate jquery for each plugin
19:35  Alan502: ajpiano, I know but I'm using CMS made simple
19:35  ajpiano: ok
19:35  Alan502: ajpiano, and one of it's modules generates a jquery link automatically
19:35  ajpiano: well it's breakiyour shit bro
19:35  EpiphanyG: hehe
19:35  ajpiano: cause jquery.min loads
19:35  ajpiano: then jquery lavalamp adds to jQuery.fn
19:35  ajpiano: then you come along and include jquery again
19:35  ajpiano: which blows away the existing jQuery
19:36  Alan502: ajpiano, Oh i see
19:36  ajpiano: and the plugins you attached to it
19:36  Alan502: ajpiano, But, if i leave only the jquery link that is generated by the module... lavalamp should be able to use the same call?
19:36  ajpiano: yeah
19:37  ajpiano: you should only include jquery once on  apage
19:37  ajpiano: regardless of whatever cms you're using
19:37  Alan502: ajpiano, I tried it, but it didn't work, does order matter?
19:37  ajpiano: yes
19:37  ajpiano: you have to include jquer before plugins
19:37  Alan502: ajpiano, I see

21:27  oste15: I want to know all elements up the dom from that div
21:27  ajpiano: how long have you been using jQuery
21:27  ajpiano: kosaidpoo, it's painfully clear from this paste you have almost no familiarity with basic JS syntax
21:27  kosaidpoo: well im readin now that ebook fom sitepoint and i guess it has some error
21:28  oste15: if they have .hovered class i want to select it
21:28  ajpiano: $(".hovered")
21:28  ajpiano: kosaidpoo, this is basic syntax shit
21:28  oste15: hrm, maybe I am overthinking this
21:28  ajpiano: you're calling a method on nothing, you're missing the leading { in an object, ... the list goes on
21:29  kosaidpoo: guys $(this).animate($('a').scrollTo();}, 1000, 'easeOutBack'); what sude i put in the 'a' the taget o the clicked elemt ??
21:29  ajpiano: $(this)
21:29  ajpiano: but really, no
21:29  ajpiano: you shouldn't
21:29  ajpiano: you should be doing
21:29  ajpiano: $.scrollTo(this)

21:29  kosaidpoo: wht shud i put there

21:31  kosaidpoo: no javascript i jst stated readin this book jquery novice to ninja i dont kno the js

21:46  spiral_shell: is there any good jquery datagrids out there?
21:47  ajpiano: spiral_shell, checkout jqGrid or slickgrid

21:47  danheberden: not free, however
21:47  spiral_shell: ajpiano, cool
21:48  blaa: even with the right name attr
21:48  blaa: the serialize() is not dealing with the new form fields
21:48  blaa: =/
21:49  blaa: ajpiano another advice?
21:49  ajpiano: make a demo that shows it failing
21:50  blaa: ajpiano http://a1986.podzone.org/financeiro/invoice/new
21:50  blaa: can you access?
21:50  danheberden: and, blaa, not to ask a rediculous question but those form elements are inside of the form, ya?
21:50  ajpiano: blaa, no i cant'
21:50  blaa: danheberden yes, but let me check again

21:52  blaa: ajpiano danheberden can you access now?
21:53  blaa: if you can, click the + button
21:53  blaa: new fields are not sent
21:53  danheberden: that a lot of js files
21:53  blaa: in the firebug console you can see the response
21:54  spiral_shell: is there any good text editor jquery plugins that have configurable and context sensitive right click menus?  (This is for an online poetry editor :P)
21:54  blaa: http://a1986.podzone.org:8888/financeiro/media/js/invoice/new.js danheberden this is the .js dealing with the form
21:54  ajpiano: as someone who has written a lot of poetry and a lot of javascript, i can say that i have never wanted to deal with both at the same time
21:54  ajpiano: :p
21:55  blaa: lol
21:56  ajpiano: blaa
21:56  ajpiano: that form does not contain the new inputs
21:56  blaa: why?
21:56  ajpiano: because it doesn't
21:56  ajpiano: http://ajpiano.com/cap/46f78d.png
21:57  ajpiano: the form is a child of a div whose sibling div contains those elements
21:57  ajpiano: thus those elements are not in the form at all

22:04  rovar: hey all, I am trying to make a plugin which draws on a canvas..  I have set it up so that I can call  $("#canvas").startGame();
22:05  Bartzy: Hi
22:05  muhdik: there is html button and input type button
22:05  rovar: however.. the convention that I see for getting the 2d context is calling  ("#canvas")[0].getContext("2d")
22:05  muhdik: which should i use?
22:05  Bartzy: I want to create an accordion that has some text visible for each item
22:05  Bartzy: and when clicking it will slide and show all the text for that item
22:06  rovar: from inside the plugin.. calling  this[0].getContext obviously doesn't work.. can anyone recommend a good method for doing this?
22:06  Bartzy: And I want to allow multiple items opened
22:06  BinaryKitten: muhdik it depends on the content of the button really
22:06  muhdik: well i just want to redirect to another page
22:06  muhdik: and it just says something like pay now
22:06  BinaryKitten: if you want an image in the button, use <button><img></button> if you just want text then use <input type="button" />

22:27  Bartzy: Any idea why this ain't working ? Just showing the element immdiately
22:27  Bartzy: While .toggle('slow'), works, I can see the fade in and fade out
22:28  erichynds: tr:last doesn't exist
22:28  Bartzy: why ?
22:28  erichynds: so the slideToggle is beign called on am empty collection
22:28  erichynds: i don't know your DOM
22:28  erichynds: console.log it
22:28  Bartzy: well it exists.
22:28  erichynds: and see if it matches anything
22:28  BinaryKitten: Bartzy  can you pastebin the code for the slideToggle
22:29  BinaryKitten: or wait is that core?
22:29  Bartzy: .toggle('slow') works, and .slideToggle also works, but without the slide animation :)
22:29  erichynds: oh - i misread your question
22:30  Bartzy: BinaryKitten: That's part of jquery...
22:30  maav: slide sometimes gone crazy when fast mouse moving, try reset style of them before animate

22:39  ajpiano: BinaryKitten, you're on a multiselect?
22:39  BinaryKitten: the issue is, click an option and it deselected the rest
22:39  BinaryKitten: ajpiano yep.
22:39  erichynds: BinaryKitten, that is the default browser behavior
22:39  ajpiano: BinaryKitten, you need to get clever,
22:39  erichynds: oh, i see
22:39  ajpiano: work with the value array
22:39  BinaryKitten: hmm
22:39  ajpiano: and set it and filter stuff
22:40  ajpiano: that's how i've worked with the multiselect value manipulation
22:40  ajpiano: like, hiding adn showing options
22:40  ajpiano: removing them from the dom but persisting their values on submit
22:40  ajpiano: that type of shit
22:40  ajpiano: all involved manipulating the .val()

22:41  LordVorp: BinaryKitten: I like this plugin for multiselects: http://odyniec.net/projects/selectlist/
22:41  BinaryKitten: bah "replacements"
22:41  BinaryKitten: i'm having to merge Dojo and Jquery as it is..
22:42  BinaryKitten: don't want to add more complexity
22:42  ajpiano: also replacing a multiselect performs like ass on IE if you have a lot of elements :/
22:43  LordVorp: WHERE do I find a complete, with kinks and gotchas, tutorial or reference for dealing with instant html snippets, like $('<div />') ??
22:43  ajpiano: LordVorp, from my estimation, by your question, you need a templating solutio
22:43  ajpiano: ?templating @ LordVorp

22:45  Akin: hey, could someone take a look at my sidebar static/fixed div code?  I want to make it a little more elegant and dynamic.   http://pastebin.com/Lu2NqDUk
22:45  Akin: right now, i'm manually inputting a number for the distance from the top of the browser - is there a way to get jquery to dynamically figure that out?
22:45  ajpiano: otherwise... i don't know of some "comlpete reference" to that style... it's just a shortcut to calling .attr() and .bind() LordVorp
22:45  ajpiano: and text
22:46  LordVorp: ajpiano: OK that's really helpful, i'll check it out.
22:47  blackwhite: there isn't any difference between calling a class and an id when you are using mouse over function are there?
22:47  LordVorp: of course there is.
22:47  blackwhite: what I mean is that both are possible
22:47  LordVorp: blackwhite: $("#dom_id") is different from $(".class_name")
22:48  LordVorp: other than the nit I just mentioned, nope, no difference functionally
22:48  blackwhite: hmm ok
22:50  mohadib: hello
22:50  mohadib: can i select all select objects that have a selected value of "Email" ?
22:51  mohadib: $('#listPreview-0 select[name^="colType_"] option[value="email"][selected]')
22:51  mohadib: trying that, but im getting nothing
22:51  blackwhite: Anyone knows why this wont trigger an event http://pastebin.com/DGA4jgcU
22:52  Gate: Akin: is 115 the height of some particular element?
22:52  RTPMatt: blackwhite: ('#idea') class="idea"
22:52  Akin: gate - yes, thats how far down the #sidebar element is on the page.
22:52  kolor: u set up hover for #idea container, rather than row
22:52  BinaryKitten: Also...
22:52  BinaryKitten: you're binding to nothing
22:53  SlexAxton: $('#listPreview select').filter(function(){ return $(this).val() === 'email'; });
22:53  BinaryKitten: as when the script runs, the elements do Not yet exist
22:53  RTPMatt: that too
22:54  blackwhite: so I need to do a document ready
22:54  BinaryKitten: yes
22:54  BinaryKitten: OR move your code to just before the </body>
22:54  BinaryKitten: i prefer the later really
22:54  RTPMatt: and refrence a class like a class and an id like an id
22:54  Gate: Akin: then I would put it in a variable (treat it like a const) at least that way you only have to put it in one place.
22:55  mohadib: how can i refer to a select objects selected value in a selector?  select[value="foo"] doesnt work
22:55  ravenzz: why not?
22:56  ravenzz: you should use each()
22:56  blackwhite: so I can only use hover for rows?
22:56  Akin: gate - yeah, i think so too, but what code should i used to make JQuery figure out how far that div is from the window top at the start?
22:56  SlexAxton: mohadib: i just pasted your answer
22:56  SlexAxton: up there ^
22:56  ravenzz: $('select[value="foo"]').each(function() { dosomething() });
22:57  SlexAxton: selects don't have a value attribute
22:57  SlexAxton: use a filter
22:57  mohadib: SlexAxton: thanks
22:57  SlexAxton: it's not appropriate to do all of that in a selector
22:57  SlexAxton: too much magic
22:57  Gate: Akin: I get what you mean, try $("#sidebar").position
22:57  Gate: http://api.jquery.com/position/
22:57  ravenzz: oh yes sure
22:58  ravenzz: select dont have value
22:58  BinaryKitten: they don't?
22:58  SlexAxton: they have options
22:58  SlexAxton: and the options have a selected attribute
22:58  ravenzz: yep
22:59  SlexAxton: i think maybe some browsers might have a value expando
22:59  SlexAxton: anyways
22:59  SlexAxton: but there is technically no attribute, though
22:59  BinaryKitten: heh selectedIndex FTW!
22:59  SlexAxton: (only pretty sure)
23:02  mohadib: i thought jquery might do some magic there
23:02  blackwhite: thnx
23:02  blackwhite: got it to work
23:02  mohadib: as $('#aSelect').val() gets the selected option
23:04  Akin: using .offset() - how would create a variable to determine how many pixels a div is from the top of the document?
23:06  BinaryKitten: ?.offset
23:06  bot-t: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
