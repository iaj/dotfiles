00:05  bleen: how do mouseover & out events work in terms of transparent images? are the events triggered by the boiunding box or by the image's alpha boundries? is the behavior consistant across (most) browsers?
00:06  BinaryKitten: bleen it's on the tag
00:06  bleen: on the tag? meaning the bounding box of the img tag?
00:06  BinaryKitten: so it' the bounding height/width of it
00:07  bleen: boogers … is there a solution out there for rolling over images based on teh alpha?
00:09  dmshann0n: bleeh, there was some work done by paul bakaus on that

00:37  draginx1: Was does manipulating the DOM have to be slow?
00:37  BinaryKitten: was does things have to be sensical
00:38  draginx1: Why* whoops lol
00:38  draginx1: I feel like we should just get rid of DOM altogether and come up with a new system :| Or better yet, why can't FF/IE/etc. follow in Google's footsteps in regards to javascript ><
00:41  Jayflux: what do you mean draginx1, what are google doing with javascript that ie/ff aren't that affects the dom?
00:42  draginx1: Jayflux: I was more referring to speeds with that comment
00:43  Jayflux: right ok, you mentioned that and the dom in the same sentance although they have nothing to do with eachother
