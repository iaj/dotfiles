11:59  Avalarion: Hey there, I am using fancybox on a project. Is it possible, that the newest fancybox is not able to work with the 1.4.1 Version of JQuery?
11:59 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
11:59  Avalarion: I always get $("a.album").fancybox is not a function
12:00  ocf_: i have no other input Avalarion other than to say are you doing fancybox(); ?
12:00  ocf_: never worked with it, so i can't answer anything about it specifically
12:01  ocf_: i guess maybe I should start by saying - is the error thats thrown in your code, or in the fancybox js?
12:01  LazyMukke: if you do arr.splice(location,1), does it also work for the last one in the arr or should i use arr.pop()
12:01  Avalarion: ocf_: On DomReady I start: $("a.album").fancybox();
12:02  ocf_: and I assume you're including the fancybox js?
12:02  Avalarion: of course
12:02  ocf_: does googles cdn host older versions of jquery to test?
12:02  Avalarion: a good idea!
12:02  ocf_: once in a blue moon :)
12:03 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
12:03  ablomen: ocf_, http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery << click "older versions"
12:03  ocf_: ablomen - then yes, Avalarion can use that to test
12:04  Avalarion: yay, I think 1.4.1 is too old -.- I hate to work in frames that a customer gave to me...
12:04  rmurphey: if you are just doing a simple test, you can use jsfiddle, it gives you access to old versions too
12:05  ocf_: good call rmurphey
12:06  ocf_: ps, danheberden spoke very highly of you when I met with him last thurs
12:06  rmurphey: that's nice to hear :)
12:07  ocf_: I don't remember what he said exactly, but it was something along the lines of "shes the best xyz in the world" - and it was a good xyz, i swear!
12:07  Miika--: Hello
12:07  rmurphey: well, whatever it was it's probably not true, but it's nice he said so :)
12:08  ocf_: lol. he's an incredibly smart dude too. I was much smarter from the 4 hrs of coding we worked on.
12:08  ocf_: shout out to the jquery community for being awesome
12:09  Miika--: How I can stop animation? I mean, when I mouseenter, effect starts and when I mouseout and mouseenter again many times, the effect gets queued and keeps animating... I should do it only once and stop and only after stopped and then mouseentered, start again
12:09 --- mi_ is now known as mi

12:12  rmurphey: ocf_: what were you guys working on?
12:12  monkeynut: hello people ... long time no see!
12:14  monkeynut: I have a nasty little encoding problem and I just can't work out what to do about it.  I know the data is going into the DB fine and coming out fine.  When it comes out it is base64 encoded, sent by XML, retrieved by the XMLHttpReq object, btoa used to un-base64 and written into a textarea.
12:14  doonie: ?tell sean` what a twist ;D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtDYfZ2wuqA
12:14  bot-t: doonie, Okay.
12:14  ocf_: rmurphey - He helped me implement a sentiment analysis engine into a social media dashboard project I've been working on. He also helped with some db/js optimizations & pointed out some refactoring opportunities
12:15  rmurphey: sweet :)
12:15  monkeynut: special characters with accents etc are getting bodged and these bodges are getting saved to the database, can anyone help?
12:15  rmurphey: sounds like interesting stuff
12:16 --- endless is now known as patryk
12:16  ocf_: yeah it was. I'm just starting to look at 'best practice' and 'most performant' when it comes to my code, and he gave me a lot of nuggets & resources to check out
12:17  monkeynut: ajpiano, you're good with this stuff ... does jquery ajax or .text functions etc make any assumptions about encoding? Any idea if jquery can cause my chars to be malformed when written into the textarea?
12:17  rmurphey: monkeynut: have you tried methods other than .text() ?
12:18  monkeynut: not really, I'm retrieving text leaves from xml file
12:18  rmurphey: try using .val() to set the value of the textarea
12:18  monkeynut: I am
12:18  rmurphey: oh
12:18  Echoes: guys have you experience strange behavior with regards to google chrome remembering mouse coordinates from when it last left the stage
12:18  Echoes: ?
12:18  rmurphey: you just mentioned .text
12:19  monkeynut: sorry, I meant using .text() to get the value from xml, use .val to fill the textarea, good point
12:19  sac_: if i have $('a.foobar').live('click', foo) and $('a').live('click', bar), does stuff get bubbled as many times as there are selectors or only once and for each element all of the selectors are checked if they match?
12:19  monkeynut: and idea if either of those make encoding assumptions?!
12:19  sac_: am i making any sense?
12:19  rmurphey: oh hm, i'm not sure i'd use .text to get the value from the xml
12:19  rmurphey: i might get the xml node and read its value directly
12:19  rmurphey: don't know the syntax for that
12:19  monkeynut: sac_ live events don't bubble in the same way, what are you trying to do?
12:20  monkeynut: sac_ they will both fire, if that's what you're after ...
12:20  monkeynut: rmurphey: that is the syntax to read from xml nodes directly.
12:20  monkeynut: afaik
12:20  rmurphey: sorry i thought you were talking about $.fn.text()
12:20  rmurphey: it is too early for me to be talking :)
12:21  monkeynut: $(myXMLfromServer).find('myleaf').text()
12:21  rmurphey: ah so, you are using $.fn.text()
12:21  monkeynut: what else would you suggest?
12:21  rmurphey: i'm saying get the actual xml node and read whatever property contains the text value of the node
12:21  monkeynut: but that's exactly what .text does non?
12:22  rmurphey: $(myXMLfromServer).find('myLeaf')[0].something ...
12:22  rmurphey: monkeynut: and yet you aren't getting the value you expect, so it might be time to either read $.fn.text or try doing it natively
12:22  monkeynut: hmmm ... I guess I've got very little to go on, I can give it a shot ..
12:22  rmurphey: the property is .textContent
12:22  monkeynut: cheers
12:23  monkeynut: i'll let you know outcome ...
12:23  compaq: I'm coding everything in jquery, lol, skipped php shopping basket, and sql database
12:23  rmurphey: this is completely a stab in the dark
12:23  monkeynut: I know, i've been stabbing in the dark for a while! can see no reason this is mangling ...
12:24  monkeynut: actually
12:24  monkeynut: just realised
12:24  monkeynut: that can't be the issue
12:24  monkeynut: more likely to be something with .val() if anywhere in jquery
12:24  monkeynut: because the text in the leaf is base64 encoded
12:24  rmurphey: oh heh
12:24  rmurphey: ok
12:25  rmurphey: so, time to look at .val() and to try doing that natively?
12:25  monkeynut: so it has to be something either with the base64 decoding or applying the result to the textarea ...
12:25  monkeynut: I guess so rmurphey
12:25  sac_: monkeynut, no i just mean does it affect performance as much each time i add a click live event listener
12:25  compaq: see ya later guys, thanks for all your help
12:26  sac_: monkeynut, or is it optimised so that it doesn't traverse up the dom tree many times
12:26  monkeynut: sac_ do you know about event delegation?
12:26  sac_: yes
12:26  rmurphey: monkeynut: not immediately seeing anything in .val that would be causing you problems, but i'm really not the right person to even be trying to help with encoding stuffs :(
12:27  sac_: monkeynut, i'm only asking about .live though
12:27  monkeynut: ok cool, live delegates so is generally more efficient, it shouldn't have to traverse once it is set.  Unless I have still not understood what you are getting at.
12:27  Znow: Hi! Im using the Jquery UI... and i have made a dropdown(select) box with checkboxes in it... but since its a custom made dropdown box, I need to include an icon aswell... which I have by the jquery ui theme icon package... but it wont show the icon in the dropdown box.... the path is right, and ive debugged with FireBug... but it wont show
12:27  monkeynut: sac_ live works by delegating events.
12:27  sac_: yeah i know
12:28  monkeynut: rmurphey: might not be the right person, but right now you're the only person who will even bounce ideas around!
12:28  sac_: i just mean when a click happens and there is live, from what i understand it goes up from the element that was clicked and checks if the live selector matches
12:28  ocf_: I'm using $.getJSON to return an object. The output of that is in my pastebin. I also included 3 lines of code that work. I don't want to write 15 lines of code (3 per source) when I should be able to iterate through my object. http://pastebin.com/VZNdcbxv
12:28  sac_: for each element that is an ancestor of the clicked element
12:29  sac_: my question is, does it go up the tree for EACH of the live listeners or only once
12:29  ocf_: I've used a $.each(function (key, value), but I just can't figure out the syntax
12:29  sac_: guess i just gotta check the source
12:29  rmurphey: ocf_: you probably *really* want to explore using client-side templates
12:30  rmurphey: rather than iterating over an object and using values of it to populate html
12:30  rmurphey: but, that aside
12:30  monkeynut: hmmm, not sure sac_, I think it would do it for each one.  Although, thinking about it, if the comparison is the expensive operation it's the same amount of work for the js, isn't it?
12:30  sac_: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/ <3
12:30  rmurphey: $.each(obj, function(key, value) { ... })
12:31  ocf_: yeah, thats what I have been doing (see above line), but I can't figure out the right syntax
12:31  ocf_: <ocf_> I've used a $.each(function (key, value), but I just can't figure out the syntax
12:32  monkeynut: ?each @ ocf_
12:32  bot-t: ocf_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
12:32  ocf_: not of the each (yes, I know I didn't include object in my sample there), but more with what to code once i'm inside
12:32  rmurphey: ocf_: http://pastebin.com/jXSHsLbB
12:32  rmurphey: but um
12:32  rmurphey: there is a lot of various terribleness in that
12:33  sac_: yeah it seems it binds as many times as there are .live()
12:33  rmurphey: such as making the selection of the element every single time
12:33  rmurphey: ideally you'd want to make those $(...) selections once
12:33  Znow: Hi! Im using the Jquery UI... and i have made a dropdown(select) box with checkboxes in it... but since its a custom made dropdown box, I need to include an icon aswell... which I have by the jquery ui theme icon package... but it wont show the icon in the dropdown box.... the path is right, and ive debugged with FireBug... but it wont show
12:33  rmurphey: store them in an object so you can map the name of the service to the destination element
12:33  rmurphey: (s)
12:33  Znow: im using the uidropdownchecklist
12:33  Birliban: hi, js is in this case shorter: document.form1.inputname.value than jquery: $('form[name="form1"] input[name="inputname"]').val() is there a shorter way?
12:34  rmurphey: native will always be faster and sometimes be shorter too
12:34  monkeynut: sac_ I thought so, but that doesn't seem to really make it more expensive, going up an element isn't the expensive part, matching the selector is.  So unless you've got a really deep DOM it should make little difference? Either way much better than binding a simple click, that takes more memory IIRC
12:34  rmurphey: if you can use more terse css selectors for the things you're after, then you could make it shorter
12:34  Avalarion: strange
12:34  Avalarion: http://fiddle.jshell.net/enfcB/show/light/
12:35  Avalarion: here it runs
12:35  Birliban: rmurphey, ok. cant change the html source in this case... ;-)
12:35 --- BarryCarlyon_ is now known as BarryCarlyon
12:35  monkeynut: rmurphey: native is often not faster unless it's a very simple function, devs for jquery have done a really good job writing bug-free efficient code ;)
12:36  rmurphey: for that example native is going to be faster
12:36  rmurphey: no functions involved
12:36  monkeynut: yeah, for sure
12:36  rmurphey: and generally if you can access an element in a sane way natively
12:36  monkeynut: just stuck that there in case people got the idea its always better to write native code if you can
12:36  rmurphey: it will be faster than asking sizzle to do it for you
12:37  rmurphey: can you point to a case where jquery is faster than native?

12:57  afeijo: anyone using jquery and google maps api? I'm looking how to locate a specific marker, which would be the selector?
12:58  ablomen: afeijo, save your markers in an array while adding them and use that to identify them, navigating google maps html is f-ed up and slow
12:59  doonie: +1
12:59  afeijo: ablomen: hmmm it make sense, if I have thousands of makers, it would be quite slow

13:00  doonie: an object can
13:00  ablomen: afeijo, wrap them in objects

Im using the Jquery UI... and i have made a dropdown(select) box with checkboxes in it... but since its a custom made dropdown box, I need to include an icon aswell... which I have by the jquery ui theme icon package... but it wont show the icon in the dropdown box.... the path is right, and ive debugged with FireBug... but it wont show? Im using uidropdowncheckboxlist...
13:02  BinaryKitten: Znow  have you added the right classes to the item you wish to show the icon in?
13:03  BinaryKitten: eg ui-icon and ui-icon-DESIGNATOR
13:03  BinaryKitten: where DESIGNATOR is the icon you wish to use?
13:03  Znow: hmm nope :p its just: <select name="SelectorCaseWorker" id="SelectorCaseWorker" multiple="multiple">
13:04  BinaryKitten: oh it's an actual select?
13:04  Znow: yep
13:04  BinaryKitten: not all browsers allow styling of options or selects
13:04  Znow: well
13:04  Znow: by default it would show the icon then?
13:04  Znow: but it doesnt
13:05  Znow: it wants the ui-icon instead
13:05  Znow: but that it wont show
13:05  BinaryKitten: ui-icon is default styling for icon placeholders
13:05  BinaryKitten: which is usually a span
13:05  BinaryKitten: <span class="ui-icon....."></span>
13:05  Znow: O_o
13:05  Znow: well yeah
13:06  Znow: but how do I integrate that in the select
13:06  BinaryKitten: you put that in the options
13:06  Znow: ahh okay
13:06  Znow: sec
13:06  BinaryKitten: <option><span></span></option>
13:06  BinaryKitten: but no promises it will work either
13:07  BinaryKitten: since quite a few will ignore html in options
13:08  Znow: just a sec, trying it out
13:08  Znow: <option><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-arrow-1-s">Vælg alle...</span></option> right?
13:08  Znow: uuuhh works :)

13:45  EmilioTucci: ok, here is another ugly one
13:45  JKarsrud: couldn't you just set val() on the select?
13:45  EmilioTucci: we have parseInt to make sure a var is an integer...
13:45  JKarsrud: if you get the value from ajax, just insert it like this?
13:45  EmilioTucci: what about with strings
13:45  EmilioTucci: if I get a NULL I want to convert to ""
13:45  EmilioTucci: is there any function to do that?
13:45  JKarsrud: var theAjaxValue = "2"; $('select').val(theAjaxValue);
13:45  EmilioTucci: I want to save the if(!var) var="";
13:46  monkeynut: well EmilloTucci, you can just do  myvar+'';
13:46  JKarsrud: EmilioTucci: Dude, make a demo or something, IRC doesn't like this kind of stuff

14:37  qq99: oh congratz :)
14:37  cyberfab007: but I cant seem to get anything else like menues logos or any content to go on top of the resizable image
14:37  cyberfab007: amritinc.com
14:37  cyberfab007: either the content goes behind the image or it get resized with the image
14:38  jastor: cyberfab007: tried z-index?
14:38  cyberfab007: Iam sure it is a simple layering answer
14:38  qq99: mm I dunno if css media queries might be a better solution if you're looking for scaling the pic with window
14:39  qq99: tried z-index?
14:39  qq99: with your non-scaling content outside of the resizing div
14:39  qq99: and probably some position:absolutes
14:39  qq99: and also ask #css if that doesn't work
14:40  cyberfab007: I am reading about z index , and when ever I try to put the content outside it drops behind the image insted of in the front
14:40  qq99: let me try something out, brb
14:40  jastor: cyberfab007: z-index: 0;   onteh image div .. z-index: 1; on the stuff thats supposed to be ontop of it
14:40  jastor: cyberfab007: can be any number .. but the stuff thats going to be on top should be more than the underlaying image

15:20  monkeynut: depends on the plugin really
15:20  webgeek: yep I have been to this site... what have you guys done in the past to start learning a new language?  Today, I was at the coffee shop and now after typing $(document).ready(function(){ }); about 20times I am able to understand that concept.
15:20  FLX99: hey guys, quick question.
15:21  monkeynut: lol webgeek ;)
15:21  FLX99: how can I unbind an event hooked to a key (such as "b")
15:21  monkeynut: webgeek, best way I found was to think of a simple project, then implement it.
15:21  webgeek: monkeynut... like i said I am a beginner....
15:21  Gambo: the plugin is an anonymous function
15:21  webgeek: yeah that sounds like a good idea...
15:21  JKarsrud: webgeek: Easy thing to make; create a small todo list application or something :)
15:21  Gambo: is there any reference?
15:22  webgeek: I would really like to go through an only course that takes you step by step and builds as you go
15:22  monkeynut: webgeek, if you can't think of how you'd approach a project, browse around the docs for stuff that looks likely, and pay particular attention to the examples.  Then have a go yourself until you get stuck, then ask ;)
15:22  webgeek: JKarsrud i actually need one of them...
15:22  JKarsrud: Type some text into textbox, click a button, add a new element to a list with the text in the textbox :)
15:22  Gambo: $("#main").pageless( options );
15:22  Gambo: can i reference this script?
15:22  FLX99: can anyone answer my question? thanks :)
15:22  FLX99: I havent been able to unbind b yet
15:23  JKarsrud: Gambo: Spamming the channel doesn't work. If someone knows, they will probably give you an answer
15:23  webgeek: JKarsrud that is a good idea... thanks for the suggestions.
15:23  markj: FLX99 i assume you know about unbind
15:23  FLX99: markj: ofcourse
15:23  Gambo: I didn't want to spam. I just wanted to explain
15:23  markj: just how to specifically unbind that key?
15:23  Gambo: you spam more ;)
15:23  FLX99: markj: I even tried unbinding all events
15:23  FLX99: $(document).unbind();
15:23  FLX99: but that doesnt work : /
15:24  JKarsrud: webgeek: Easy enough to understand the concepts of getting, setting, creating and appending stuff :)
15:24  monkeynut: Gambo, some plugins will change stuff in the DOM and can't be easily removed unless the functionality is built in to it.  If it just binds and anonymous function to the element on some event, you can remove it with unbind()

15:24  mokush: how could I mimic this with jquery-mobile http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/carousel/ /?
15:24  monkeynut: ?unbind @ Gambo
15:24  bot-t: Gambo, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
15:24  JAAulde: Hi all. Is there a "before success" kind of method for jQuery ajax? Of is dataFilter my best bet?
15:24  JKarsrud: FLX99: What if you create a custom event, and unbind that?
15:24  Gambo: monkeynut: thx
15:24  Gambo: I'll try that
15:25  FLX99: JKarsrud: how would you do that?
15:25  monkeynut: FLX99, how did you bind the event in the first place?
15:25  FLX99: monkeynut: I tried all kinds of things
15:25  FLX99: eventually I tried $(document).unbind();
15:25  FLX99: to unbind all
15:26  monkeynut: e.g. if you have $(body).bind('keypress', blah...)   then  $(body).unbind('keypress') should work
15:26  monkeynut: maybe it is a live handler?
15:26  monkeynut: then use die()
15:26  monkeynut: instead of unbind
15:26  FLX99: hmmm
15:27  FLX99: is there a quick way to find out? Currently trying to find the exact event via firebug
15:27  FLX99: but i cant find it yet
15:27  monkeynut: I think you need firebug plugins really
15:27  monkeynut: do you have code?
15:27  sean`: no
15:27  monkeynut: should be easy to spot where it gets bound
15:27  sean`: ?ud brocode
15:27  bot-t: sean`, bro code - Conversation that friends have that only they can understand, many times this is used when describing other surroundings when opposite sexes are around, a distinguished lingual that is understood by each party as a set meaning, language that can be many words or just a few that have meaning, this language can also be taps, hand shakes, winks, nods or other forms of body language
15:28  FLX99: its scattered over several minified javascript codes
15:28  FLX99: aka the suck
15:28  monkeynut: hmmm
15:28  sean`: mmmmmmmmmmminified
15:28  FLX99: hence the reason I'm asking here :)
15:28  sean`: FLX99, whats the prob
15:28  webgeek: Would you guys suggest going though the jquery API reference and looking at each function and doing the examples?
15:29  FLX99: sean`: I'm running on a corp platform, which has several minified js
15:29  omfgitsasalmon: Hi, I need help with datepicker
15:29  sean`: webgeek, yupz
15:29  FLX99: one of them binds the b button to an event
15:29  FLX99: i'd like to unbind that
15:29  sean`: just that event?
15:29  omfgitsasalmon: how do I change the format of the value the datepicker return?
15:29  FLX99: sean`: yes
15:29  johnline: ?ud hittheslide
15:29  bot-t: johnline, Not found - hittheslide isn't defined yet.
15:29  omfgitsasalmon: i'm totally new to jQuery and am editting a theme.
15:29  johnline: ?ud hit the slide
15:29  bot-t: johnline, hit the slide - To quit one's job in truly stunning fashion.
15:29  monkeynut: does the b button activate anywhere on the page, regardless of focus?
15:29  johnline: :D
15:29  sean`: FLX99, you can hack the source and set a namespace
15:29  FLX99: monkeynut: yes
15:30  sean`: enabling you to do .unbind ('.foo')
15:30  johnline: ?ud run and tell that
15:30  bot-t: johnline, Run and tell that - Meaning to go spread the word. To let it be known. To go tell everyone quickly.
15:30  sean`: FLX99, what kind of event is it?
15:30  monkeynut: FLX99 have you tried both $('body').unbind() and $('body').die()  ?? on body not document.
15:30  omfgitsasalmon: Hello?
15:30  omfgitsasalmon: Can anyone help me?
15:30  sean`: no
15:30  FLX99: sean`: when pressing the B button it loads a new page which loads the "new blog" page
15:30  mekwall: hmm
15:30  mekwall: weird
15:30  monkeynut: I like sean`'s idea too
15:30  sean`: FLX99, you're not reading my questions
15:30  webgeek: you know after looking at jquery.com in more detail I think its where I need to spend some time..
15:30  sean`: FLX99, $('.poo').data ('events') will give you all the events
15:30  mekwall: calling datepicker() creates an empty div at the end of body
15:31  sean`: You can look at the function defintion, and find it in the minified code
15:31  FLX99: ah, i'll check it
15:31  sean`: This way you can identify your bind
15:31  monkeynut: omfgitsasalmon: if you have a question just ask ...
15:31  sean`: and then set a namespace on it
15:31  FLX99: my apologies sean`, didnt read that
15:31  omfgitsasalmon: I already asked, no one is answering...
15:31  JKarsrud: omfgitsasalmon: $.datepicker.formatDatE? :)
15:31  mekwall: http://gyazo.com/3dde17ba37e64fad0a2ba15f66a2fa51.png
15:31  mekwall: looks like that at the bottom left :/
15:31  sean`: dateFormat ?
15:31  omfgitsasalmon: how do I do that. currently, 	jQuery( ".datepicker" ).datepicker();
15:31  omfgitsasalmon: this code is initializing it.
15:31  omfgitsasalmon: in html
15:32  FLX99: sean`
15:32  FLX99: $(document).data ('events')
15:32  FLX99: TypeError: $(document) is null
15:32  Nomikos: Is it possible to animate a colour to transparent?
15:32  sean`: omfgitsasalmon, jQuery ('.datepicker').datepicker ({dateFormat: ..});
15:32  omfgitsasalmon: at <input name="datepicker" class="datepicker" />
15:32  JKarsrud: omfgitsasalmon: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
15:32  sean`: FLX99, how sure are you that it fires ont he dom
15:32  sean`: document*
15:32  FLX99: sean`: i don't thats the problem
15:32  mekwall: <div id="ui-datepicker-div" class="ui-datepicker ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix ui-corner-all"></div> <--- Isn't that supposed to be display: none ?
15:32  JKarsrud: .datepicker("option", "dateFormat", "dd/mm/yyyy") for instance
15:32  sean`: FLX99, do you have your page online?
15:32  omfgitsasalmon: Oh okay, let me try
15:33  omfgitsasalmon: I was reading http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker#options
15:33  monkeynut: I think FLX99 needs a way to see where the event is actually bound.  I would suggest a plugin like eventbug
15:33  sean`: or the minified file FLX99
15:33  sean`: plz give me a link
15:33  omfgitsasalmon: and tried "option", "altFormat", 'yy-mm-dd' to no avail
15:33  FLX99: sean`: there are 20 of them :)
15:33  sean`: omfgitsasalmon, that's only for the altField
15:33  sean`: FLX99, /care ?
15:33  sean`: put it online
15:33  omfgitsasalmon: sean`: Hmm, not working.
15:33  sean`: there must be ONE which has the 'filename' of the file you're including
15:33  monkeynut: FLX99 have you tried http://getfirebug.com/releases/eventbug/1.5/
15:34  mekwall: http://gyazo.com/37d20ef7e705deaf2437c778da494d36.png <--- Got the inline datepicker to work, but for some reason it's adding an empty div to the bottom of body
15:34  omfgitsasalmon: After I changed it to dateFormat, the datepicker would not show.
15:34  monkeynut: should be easy to see what binds the keypress event to what, then it will be easy to remove.
15:34  sean`: omfgitsasalmon, see ?pasetbin
15:34  bot-t: omfgitsasalmon, PASTEBIN.ME - http://push2check.com/pastebin.me
15:34  FLX99: monkeynut, I'll try that
15:34  FLX99: sean`: I'll try eventbug first
15:34  FLX99: I don't wanna overload you guys with stuff
15:34  sean`: lol
15:34  sean`: FLX99, CTRL + F
15:35  sean`: your filename..
15:35  sean`: KISS man
15:35  omfgitsasalmon: this is the JS: http://pastebin.me/1d756f95a00c201558004c3ad6e65b8c
15:35  omfgitsasalmon: the html code to initialize it is <input name="datepicker" class="datepicker" />
15:35  sean`: omfgitsasalmon, I dno't see the dateFormat there
15:36  omfgitsasalmon: yeah currently, it's jQuery( ".datepicker" ).datepicker("option", "dateFormat", 'yy-mm-dd');
15:36  mekwall: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4111
15:36  mekwall: bah
15:36  mekwall: that sux
15:36  omfgitsasalmon: doesn't work, removing params work
15:36  Brodingo: holler
15:36  monkeynut: unlucky mekwall! fancy fixing it ;)
15:36  mekwall: monkeynut: if I had the time hehe
15:37  mekwall: deadline in january :/
15:37  monkeynut: its funny how workaround always seems easier ... why the hell is that?!
15:38  monkeynut: Brodingo, that's pretty random ...
15:39  omfgitsasalmon: sean`: I have no idea why it won't work.
15:39  mekwall: $('#ui-datepicker-div').hide() <-- adding that to the last line of of your ready-script solves it :P
15:39  mekwall: ugly hack though
15:42  FLX99: sean`: it's too much of a mess, is there a way to unbind all keypress and keydown binders all together?
15:42  mekwall: monkeynut: same reason it's easier to make cash if you're an asshole
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: currently, the datepicker is returning mm/dd/yyyy
15:42  monkeynut: lol mekwall
15:42  mekwall: monkeynut: well, it's true :D
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: I want it to return yy-mm-dd as in 2010-12-14 as I want it to go into a sql database
15:42  FLX99: sean`: for example: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Capturing+HTTP+traffic+using+Wireshark+or+Fiddler
15:42  FLX99: press E
15:42  FLX99: goes to edit
15:42  mekwall: monkeynut: taking care of others, and being a morally good person that behaves and follow all the laws... won't get rich ;)
15:42  FLX99: I assume it uses the same kind of event binder for B
15:42  sean`: where
15:42  sean`: there is no E
15:42  sean`: FLX99, find out what key is B
15:42  sean`: and then do == 'code'
15:42  sean`: CTRL F
15:42  FLX99: ...right, only when you're logged in
15:42  FLX99: fuck
15:42  sean`: AGAIN, CTRL + F is fucking brilliant
15:42  monkeynut: FLX99, do you know the names of any functions that are being called?
15:42  sean`: or you cans earch for .keyCode
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: sean`: Any idea?
15:42  jomofcw: is there a correct CSS selector for that : .page #zone_secondaire.court
15:42  sean`: omfgitsasalmon, no
15:42  sean`: yo don't seem to be paying attentino
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: =/
15:42  jomofcw: Hi sean` :)
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: Huh?
15:42  mekwall: monkeynut: coding a virus that will take 0.0001% of all accounts in the world and transfer them to 1000 off-shore proxy accounts that will later bounce back to you, will make you rich...
15:42  omfgitsasalmon: I'm looking at the chat

15:49  FLX99: monkeynut: yes, but no results
15:49  FLX99: this js is a fucking mess

15:54  Nomikos: volpeo: you can replace the text with a same-sized canvas element on the fly and go wild in that :-)
15:54  volpeo: yeah but canvas ...
15:54  Nomikos: yeah, yeah, yeah, but /text with a texture/ :-p
15:54  volpeo: lol
15:54  FLX99: it uses a similar event when you push "T" on http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Capturing+HTTP+traffic+using+Wireshark+or+Fiddler
15:54  volpeo: i think i'll go with my *ucking php and GD

15:56  monkeynut: FLX99, try loading your code and running this from the firebug console: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1172127/how-do-i-identify-which-events-have-bound-via-javascript
15:56  monkeynut: (as in, the answer to the question)
15:56  monkeynut: but replace click with keypress,keyup,keydown
15:57  monkeynut: FLX99, it's hard to see what's going on with just the minified code you linked, I don't have much time either!
15:58  monkeynut: FLX99, search for this string: AJS.bind("initialize.keyboardshortcuts
15:58  monkeynut: I believe that's where your shortcuts are bound.
15:58  FLX99: TypeError: $("*") is null
15:59  FLX99: ah, hold on
15:59  FLX99: i need to fix some of this quirky stuff
16:01  FLX99: monkeynut, unfortunately it doesnt work since it's quite quirky
16:01  FLX99: it has modified some jquery
16:01  monkeynut: eh? what doesn't work ...
16:01  monkeynut: modified jquery? are you sure you don't mean *extended* jquery?
16:01  FLX99: AJS.$(this) for example instead of $(this)
16:02  monkeynut: I think jquery is within AJS object in that case
16:02  FLX99: try it for example on http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Capturing+HTTP+traffic+using+Wireshark+or+Fiddler
16:02  monkeynut: which is strange!
16:02  monkeynut: FLX99, how do you know that code works the same way?
16:02  FLX99: i know that it doesnt
16:03  FLX99: because console throws an error
16:03  Bartzy: I want to create a click event (the actual event object) of clicking in the middle (horziontal-wise) of an element (<img> for example)
16:03  Bartzy: How can I calculate that ?
16:04  madtimber: check that your target is the element that you're wanting, then grab the offsets of the e.clientX and e.clientY values
16:04  johnline: background-color:#barbera-streisand;
16:04  madtimber: solid
16:04  madtimber: anyone a jQTouch user?
16:04  monkeynut: Bartzy, or use a transparent element and bind to that ...
16:06  madtimber: no jQTouch devs at all?

16:07  tsyrak: hey guys, if i change a dropped div's parent, it changes its position. is there any known fix to that?
16:08  Lion31: hello... I am using UI autocomplete... specially the example with categorized output:  http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#categories  .... now I'd like that items would render the HTML in my JSON... so something Like te<b>st</b> label would actually render the HTML
16:08  monkeynut: tsyrak, that's supposed to happen if the parent's size, position, float etc are changed.
16:09  monkeynut: FLX99, I was looking at that site, not getting much for T or V ...
16:09  Bartzy: monkeynut, madtimber: I want to create only the event , the user don't move or touch the mouse at all
16:09  FLX99: when you press T it should go to attachments
16:09  madtimber: then you can use .trigger
16:09  Bartzy: I want the event so I can artifitically create the click with that event
16:10  madtimber: and trigger the click
16:10  FLX99: monkeynut: regardless if you're logged in or not
16:10  madtimber: and pass it in its own e object
16:10  Bartzy: madtimber: Yes, but how do I get the X and Y of the middle of the element ?
16:10  tsyrak: nothing has been changed except for the parent here monkeynut, is this still supposed to happen?
16:10  madtimber: you'll have to select the element
16:10  monkeynut: tsyrak, how has the parent changed?
16:10  madtimber: and find its offsets
16:10  Bartzy: madtimber: e.pageX is for the whole page.. meaning I need to do some calculations based on the offset... but then there's window size, resolutions and stuff...
16:11  madtimber: well, which "middle" do you want?
16:11  monkeynut: oh righ, I was already on attachments FLX99! :P
16:11  Bartzy: horizontal middle
16:11  Bartzy: oh I got it
16:11  madtimber: with respect to?
16:11  FLX99: monkeynut: hahaha :P
16:11  tsyrak: monkeynut: i have use appendTo to move it from one div to an other
16:11  madtimber: you just find the height and cut it in half ;)
16:11  Bartzy: just $elem.offset().left + $elem.width()/2
16:11  Bartzy: thanks.
16:11  madtimber: there ya go
16:12  madtimber: err....I meant width
16:12  madtimber: lol
16:12  Bartzy: Another question :p
16:12  Bartzy: if I have $('#elem') , and I use it twice in my page.. but the 2nd time is rare that users will even get to...
16:12  Bartzy: Should I still cache it ?
16:13  Bartzy: the 1st time people will always use
16:13  Michael: It can't hurt.
16:13  madtimber: kinda depends on the complexity that would cause in the code.....maybe its easier for you to maintain, calling it twice
16:13  Bartzy: Nah, I have a cache_objects() function that I call at start
16:13  madtimber: then slap it in there
16:13  Bartzy: just cache stuff at my_namespace.objects.$whatever_element
16:13  madtimber: right
16:14  Bartzy: I'm asking memory-wise
16:14  madtimber: you're fine
16:14  Bartzy: thanks.
16:14  madtimber: one element more isnt going to break the bank
16:14  Bartzy: So it's OK to cache dozens of jquery elements ?
16:14  madtimber: well yeah
16:14  monkeynut: tsyrak, that's not what I mean.  The parent div is obviously not identical before and after.  In what ways is the resulting parent different, regardless of how you changed anything ...
16:14  Bartzy: (Assuming I use them more than once)
16:14  madtimber: its more 'expensive' not to cache them
16:15  madtimber: ...if you're going to be selecting them more than once
16:15  schuranator: Anyone know if there is a way to get the success url after an ajax post?
16:15  madtimber: when I build widgets and such, one of the first things any of my init functions do, is to select the elements I'll be using and stash them in a var for later use
16:15  tsyrak: monkeynut: the parent has 3 divs in it. once i dropped one, the other two move on the left.
16:16  monkeynut: tsyrak, I would expect that
16:16 --- adoven_ is now known as adovenmuehle
16:16  monkeynut: I'm guessing  the other two are floating divs?

16:17  tsyrak: monkeynut: i am trying to figure out the distance by which they are moved and correct it... are there more classy ways to solve the issue?
16:18  monkeynut: hmmm, are you sure they haven't hired gremlins to change window.location manually, FLX99 ?
16:18  monkeynut: tsyrak, you can:

16:21  tsyrak: monkeynut: you mean the float is causing the problem then?
16:21  Bartzy: madtimber: Because I'm using a plugin that does something 'on click', and it doesn't expose that...
16:21  Bartzy: And I don't want to rewrite the plugin :|
16:21  Bartzy: is that bad ?
16:21  monkeynut: tsyrak, you may or may not want the floating, depending on the look you're going for
16:21  tsyrak: well i do nned it
16:21  tsyrak: i'm just a little confused about option 2)
16:21  madtimber: not really, I suppose
16:22  monkeynut: tsyrak: I suggest either playing with the 3 options above or posting the example site and maybe I can give a recommendation of how I would get the desired effect in that case .
16:22  madtimber: just do $(document).trigger('click', {data})
16:22  madtimber: and in data, you'll pass in the variables that the plugin needs
16:22  madtimber: ** I may have the arguments/order wrong, but you can looks it up
16:23  tsyrak: monkeynut: http://www.visionboard.me/ just type a random word in the box, drop the image and click 'test' you'll see
16:23  madtimber: and "data" is just JS object
16:23 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
16:23  Bartzy: madtimber: Cool. and $(document) is ofcourse changed to my element ?
16:24  madtimber: well, in this case it doesnt sound like its going to matter
16:24  madtimber: unless the plugin needs the element's id or properties for something
16:25  madtimber: then yeah, you'd change it to the element
16:25  Bartzy: ok.
16:25  Over[A2xS]: hi all
16:26  faraway: hi everyone .. i have a strange problem with building a node with jQuery("<div></div>"); in safari 3.0.x as soon as there e.g. is an euro sign between the tags i get an error
16:26  Over[A2xS]: is there a way to do this : if ($('#myTRid').attr('odd')==true) ?
16:27  Over[A2xS]: if ($('#myTRid').attr(':odd')==true) ?
16:28  sean`: pfft, done
16:29  madtimber: faraway: switch to US dollars, then it wont error out ;)
16:29  faraway: madtimber: :D
16:29  monkeynut: sorry FLX99 , that's a bit too fubar, I've got to get back on with my code.  If you can obtain an un-minified version of that script, I'll give it another look. It's just taking too long to reverse engineer and I can't find the events on the page you linked either ...
16:29  madtimber: other than that, it sounds like an encoding issue
16:30  nlogax: Over[A2xS]: you have an attr called :odd?
16:30  Over[A2xS]: no in fact, i want to test if the TR i use in my if() is :odd or :even
16:30  tsyrak: monkeynut: hmm it also happens with only just one div in the original parent div
16:30  monkeynut: Over[A2xS]: I think you actually want  if($('#myTRid').is(':odd') ) { blah }
16:30  Over[A2xS]: ha
16:30  Over[A2xS]: thx :)
16:30  Over[A2xS]: .is
16:31  nlogax: i suspect you want :nth-child(odd) too
16:32  monkeynut: tsyrak, whenever you remove a div, if it is part of a set that are in any way relative or floating, the browser will re-calculate positions and re-apply them, after every dom change.
16:32  faraway: madtimber: ah ok .. you are right .. its the charset .. all scripts where included with uft-8 charset except that one
16:33  madtimber: there ya go
16:33  faraway: madtimber: thx ;)

16:40  Bartzy: madtimber: $image_content.trigger('click', {pageX: x_coord,pageY: y_coord});
16:40  Bartzy: doesn't work :|
16:40  Bartzy: I don't think it can work without actually creating an event by using $.Event ?
16:40  Mahi: http://paste.enzotools.org/show/1426/
16:41  DoDoNL: .live() isn't called at all
16:41  madtimber: ZOMG.....tables!!!  everyone run!!!!!
16:41  faianca: zn its break;
16:41  madtimber: Bartzy: hmmm
16:42  Mahi: Anyone here to help me out please???
16:42  zn: faianca: hehe now i see :) :) :)
16:42  faianca: lol
16:42  madtimber: Bartzy: if you trigger a 'click' event, anything listening for it, will 'hear' it
16:42  johnline: i double click hyperlinks
16:42  Bartzy: madtimber: Right, I just want to trigger the click event with my own specified pageX and pageY
16:43  Bartzy: so I must create an event using $.Event , and pass it to trigger ?
16:43  madtimber: hhmm, sounds like you might have to
16:43  Bartzy: ok, thanks.
16:43  madtimber: yeah, cause I guess you're not really clicking, so some of that data doesnt really exist

16:47  Tallisman: Hmm, one question.. is it possible to draw a number of circles (for loop or something) and then bind a event to any of them? i have tryed <canvas> but mouse interaction isn't supported. svg might be an option but the circles must be randomly placed and the number also random, does anyone has a solution to do this without going to flash?
16:47  nlogax: canvas supports interaction
16:48  Over[A2xS]: if($(this).is(':nth-child(odd)')==true) { << this works :) thx again

Anyone who could help me out?
16:54  Bartzy: When creating an Event Object by using $.Event, I can add my own custom properties, and they will be passed with the event when triggered ?

16:56  brian_irish: Given a single photo on a page, and clicking that photo brings up another photo as fast as possible via a generated queue of images with display:none, will photos that are eventually brought in via ajax calls be pre-loaded properly if they are just set to display:none?
16:56  madtimber: Bartzy: yup, thats the idea
16:57  madtimber: should be able to get them off the event object thats exposed in the listener
16:57  Bartzy: madtimber: So blah = $.Event('click'); blah.my_own_property = true;    that's totally valid ?
16:57  Bartzy: and will be pased to the event object in the listener ?
16:57  Bartzy: oh, cool thanks!
16:57  madtimber: well
16:57  madtimber: let me actually look, im telling you this all by memory

17:00  gym_jane: Hi :)
17:00  gym_jane: i need abit of help please
17:02  Bartzy: What's the best way to do some action on 3 elements ?
17:02  Bartzy: $element1.add($element2).add($element3).css('opacity', 1) ?
17:03  monkeynut: gym_jane, ask the question already :P
17:03  monkeynut: Bartzy:  $('selector1,selector2,selector3').css('stuff');
17:04  Bartzy: monkeynut: Is it better than .add(), or it's the same ?
17:04  monkeynut: I think its slightly faster, same result.
17:04  monkeynut: in fact, i'm pretty sure its faster.
17:04  monkeynut: not that I really care about that except for really intensive bits of code ...
17:04  Bartzy: ok.. why it's faster ?
17:05  monkeynut: because you just get one set of elements and apply an action to them all.  Rather than getting one, calling a function on that to add to the matched set, doing it again, then calling a function on the total set.
17:06  monkeynut: as a general rule, the more that stuff happens internally in jquery rather than *using* jquery, the faster it will be.
17:06  level09: how do I de-serialize a json_encoded php variable in jquery ?
17:07  Bartzy: monkeynut: $('#dragwrapper'+randID+', #lt-arrow'+randID+', #rt-arrow'+randID).css('opacity', 1);
17:07  Bartzy: This ain't working for some reason.. probably the ',' Are not right ?
17:07  ablomen: level09, $.parseJSON, or $.getJSON if you load it with ajax
17:07  level09: ablomen: i'm not loading it with ajax
17:07  monkeynut: nope Bartzy, commas look fine for me, sure the IDs are right?
17:07  ablomen: then parseJSON
17:07  Bartzy: yes.
17:07  level09: var jsvar = <?php echo json_encode($phpvar); ?>;
17:08  monkeynut: Bartzy, hyphens before ids?
17:08  Bartzy: monkeynut: What ?
17:08  monkeynut: is it lt-arrow666 or lt-arrow-666
17:08  monkeynut: ?
17:11 --- ben_alman_ is now known as ben_alman
17:12  monkeynut: Bartzy^^
17:12  Bartzy: monkeynut: Maybe because I have $('#rt-arrow'+randID).stop().animate({opacity:0},50);, before my other line... the css('opacity', 1) actually happens, but then the animate finishes ?
17:12  Bartzy: Because the #dragwrapper does change opacity to 1
17:12  monkeynut: ahh
17:12  monkeynut: yes
17:13  Bartzy: but $('#lt-arrow'+randID).stop().css('opacity', 1);
17:13  monkeynut: so it is working but something else is going wrong, that makes sense
17:13  Bartzy: Won't help (I added the stop() to stop the animation of the opacity)
17:13  Bartzy: I don't understand why the animation of the opacity doesn't stop
17:16  monkeynut: ?stop
17:16  bot-t1: .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
17:17  monkeynut: so you do that and the animation just completes? Are they in the same thread?
17:17  monkeynut: Bartzy: I think i'd have to see code from this point ..

17:43  jchillerup: Why can't you use the id attribute?
17:44  bubbafoley: jchillerup: you could use localStorage
17:45  _Brun0_: jchillerup: why would I set id attribute if tehre is already a unique identifier for each html element that is given by the browser?

17:48  ajpiano: right,

17:49  jedimind_: i need to bitch at his snowball js on his site
17:49  _Brun0_: but crossbrowser
17:49  jedimind_: that eats up 200% of cpu
17:49  Jonz: _Brun0_ it looks like that method just generates a new (read: not currently used in this document) ID each time it is invoked
17:49  ajpiano: _Brun0_, there is no such thing
17:49  ajpiano: crossbrowser
17:50  jchillerup: CSSgirl: Yeah, that's not the problem
17:50  ajpiano: that's some proprietary microsoft thing
17:50  jchillerup: The problem is that clicking both the circles yields mr and not jch in the alert
17:51  ajpiano: jchillerup, cause you are storing the 'uri' in 'bar' which is n a shared scope
17:51  ajpiano: so it's not "global"
17:51  ajpiano: but it is shared by all plugin invocations
17:52  ajpiano: everything in your plugin should be private to the plugin... so why you'd stick an argument, that was private, into a higher scope...is beyond me
17:52  ajpiano: and also that expand function... guess what...IT'S GLOBAL!!!

17:56  ajpiano: jchillerup, yes, but make sure you do var foo = function() {} or function foo() {} to make sure it's private to the plugin
17:56  ajpiano: keep in mnid you won't be able to access those methods publicly
17:56  arpegius: ajpiano: thanks. i want to act upon the new $('.tooltip') element tho. should I return $('.tooltip') (doesn't work)
17:56  pallet: in jQuery, if I do a .load(subpage.php) from mainpage.php is there any link with variables between subpage.php and mainpage.php
17:57  ajpiano: arpegius, you shouldn't return that, it's not consistent with jquer'ys plugin authoring guidelines,
17:57  ajpiano: instead you should store a reference to the tooltip in the data of the original element and access it that way, if you ask me
17:57  arpegius: ajpiano: that makes sense. i'll try that.

18:21  orentanay: my store relies on jquery to style elements that I can't access via templates or CSS, but every now and then my JS file doesn't load, and the modifications never happen. I've used firebug and could see that the js file was not loaded. Any ideas? Thanks.
18:22  Abby1: Sorry, i should have said script tags.
18:23  Abby1: if i browse directly to my page i will see all 7 script tags in place in the source code. But if i use .load the whole page but the script tags are there
18:24  danheberden: orentanay: by loaded you mean never downloaded (by looking at your net tab)?
18:24  erichynds: jquery executes them and then discards them
18:24  SEJeff_work: danheberden, So it was pretty easy to add id="active" to the specific h3 in the accordion that should be active
18:25  SEJeff_work: But via the jquery ui, the way to activate a specific version is like this: $("#accordion").accordion("option", "active", 3)
18:25  orentanay: danheberden, that is correct. But this only happens randomly.
18:25  SEJeff_work: where 3 the number of the element
18:25  Abby1: ehh? what about functions that are required later? can i not have them discared?
18:26  SEJeff_work: What is the best way to get the number of the  <h3> with id="active" in a list of <h3>'s

18:33  ajpiano: Abby1
18:33  ajpiano: it's not "weird"
18:33  ajpiano: it's how it works
18:33  SEJeff_work: It seems expected behavior to me.
18:33  ajpiano: $.fn.load does not add script tags into the dom
18:33  ajpiano: it is indeed the expected behavouir
18:33  Abby1: aha, and there are no other methods to acomplish this?
18:34  Bartzy: how can I select an element by an attribute ?
18:35  ajpiano: Abby1, it's not clear to me why you need to actually hvve it put the script tag in the DOM
18:35  ajpiano: why do you need that
18:35  Bartzy: need to get an element that its data-idx=3
18:35  developerhealey: Hello fellow JQueriers
18:35  developerhealey: haha
18:35  Bartzy: And is it really bad performance ?

18:36  Abby1: The load function loads a page into my content div, it contains function for autocompleting on that page. But now the autocomplete code is being striped.
18:36  developerhealey: Well...    I gotta question regarding .ajax()         is there a general hook events that when any ajax request is started and finished that a loading dialog will make the rest of the site inactive?   i was looking at loadmask()
18:36  ajpiano: Abby1: are you using load with a selector??
18:37  ajpiano: ?ajaxStart @ developerhealey

18:37  ajpiano: Abby1, that should be executing the scripts
18:38  ajpiano: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide46 Abby1
18:38  Abby1: maybe i understand wrong, but shouldn't the script execute when i start typing?
18:38  codeshah: hey guys, I am trying to use a datetimepicker http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ ... but the time slider does not show up ;(
18:38  ajpiano: Abby1, what you are understanding wrong is that there are intermediate steps called debugging
18:38  ajpiano: that you are supposed to do
18:38  Bartzy: $('li[data-filter-id="15"]'), is that slow if it's in a context of less than15-20 objects ?
18:38  ajpiano: when your code doesn't work
18:39  ajpiano: Abby1, also including the script tags is ingernally messy and gross
18:39  ajpiano: and you should be using a callback or something else to invoke stuff on remote content
18:39  ajpiano: not including <Script> tags in the remote content
18:39  erichynds: codeshah, no one can possibly help you without more information
18:39  ajpiano: if you can avoid it
18:40  Abby1: Well i can't, they get added by the scriptmanager of .net
18:41  ajpiano: i guess that means you also can't make a live demo that dupllicates the behaviour or anything like that
18:41  ajpiano: ?
18:42  Abby1: let me try to forward some ports, would you mind if i send it to you privatly?
18:42  ajpiano: ugh that is not what i'm hoping for

18:43  Bartzy: anyone ?
18:43  erichynds: Bartzy, define slow
18:43  ajpiano: Bartzy, as long as you have the element type as well it shouldnt' be that bad
18:43  Bartzy: noticeable
18:43  Bartzy: Is it better to just pass my function the element ?
18:43  Bartzy: I already have it in most cases... It's just ugly to pass it to a function
18:43  ajpiano: no, it's not even close to noticabl
18:44  erichynds: 13-20 elems isn't very many
18:44  Bartzy: but maybe it's more stupid to search for it again :|

18:44  JKarsrud: howcome position() doesnt have a setter?
18:44  Abby1: ow well thanks anyway, ill see if i can fix it some other way
18:44  erichynds: and even then it depends more on the size of your DOM rather than the number of elements it could match
18:45  cohitre: Bartzy: give it a class too
18:46  cohitre: $("li.filter[data-filter-id=12]")
18:47  Bartzy: I'll just pass the element to my function.. thanks all
18:48  ajpiano: Bartzy, sesriously dude
18:48  ajpiano: you are NOT getting the idea here
18:50  Bartzy: Courisity question: What's quicker : check if variable is true or false, or setting an variable to true or false ?
18:51  Bartzy: ajpiano: Why I'm not getting the idea ? What's the idea ? :)
18:51  Bartzy: I got that it's not noticeable. But I figured out I already have the element. Why search for it again on another function, if I can just pass it ?
18:51  ajpiano: you are like, insanely concerned about these minute perf concerns

If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element).
