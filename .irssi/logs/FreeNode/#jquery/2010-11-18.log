09:04  sean`: and what a fine morning it is
09:15  doonie: sean` why so

09:36  feesh: what's the score with a sudden jolt at the end of a slideDown? isn't it possible to accurately predict the height of an element when fully expanded?
09:39  Xtracted: good morning
09:39  JKarsrud: feesh: Never noticed, which browser?
09:39  feesh: chromium
09:39  feesh: sorry, chrome
09:40  feesh: I'll check if it's the same in each one
09:40  feesh: I've only been using jquery for all of 10 minutes essentially
09:40  JKarsrud: Isn't that just the easing?
09:40  JKarsrud: feesh: Hah, okay :)
09:40  feesh: JKarsrud: care for a pm?
09:40  JKarsrud: not really
09:41  feesh: that's a no right?
09:41  JKarsrud: feesh: Yeah, it's better for everyone to keep it in here :)
09:41  feesh: on IE it's the worst it seems
09:41  JKarsrud: no wonder
09:42  feesh: well the scenario is, got a table, with a div that's display:none; to begin with, click a link, it expands, with just text inside
09:42  feesh: gets to half way, then it shoots to the end
09:42  JKarsrud: Even if you repeat the animation?
09:42  JKarsrud: Or refresh?
09:42  feesh: don't believe it's anything to do with easing, maybe it's a min-height thing
09:42  feesh: yeah
09:43  JKarsrud: okay
09:43  perty: suppose i have a dynamically generated link that calls a function with a parameter. when i click this link, is there any fancy way to make that specific link's text change?
09:44  ajpiano: ?text
09:44  bot-t: .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
09:44  ajpiano: it's not very fancy
09:44  ajpiano: but it is what you want
09:44  JKarsrud: perty: this is the element that triggered the element, and call text() on it to change the text
09:44  JKarsrud: as ajpiano points out
09:46  JKarsrud: feesh: did your div have min-height?
09:46  feesh: don't think so
09:46  JKarsrud: okay
09:46  JKarsrud: Can you hook up a demo on jsfiddle.net :)
09:46  JKarsrud: While I get some coffee
09:51 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
09:53  JKarsrud: feesh: You could try using animate() too, to see if the result is the same?
09:53  feesh: JKarsrud: if you could give us a hint how to use it
09:53  feesh: I'm banging out an example on jsfiddle
09:54  JKarsrud: ?animate @ feesh
09:54  bot-t: feesh, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
09:55  feesh: eep, I'll get this demo done then I'll give it a whirl
09:55  JKarsrud: Allright =)
09:55  Xtracted: is there a cleaner way to get only the left value from .offset() then first getting the offset as a variable, then pick out the offset.left from that?
09:57  feesh: shoot me now
09:57  feesh: CTRL+W ...
09:57  feesh: web browser, no es nano >.<
09:59  Xtracted: stupid, stupid, stupid math in javascript
10:01  nlogax: offset().left
10:01  sean`: upset().right
10:01  doonie: damn().right
10:02  Xtracted: nlogax: nice... now how do i make the math work when offset().left is -100 and i add -100 to it and it becomes -1680?
10:03 --- amh345_ is now known as amh345
10:03  Xtracted: nlogax: it gets messed up since i use +'%' to get a percent value
10:03  feesh: I can't get an abstract example working >.<
10:04  feesh: http://www.bpna.org.uk/distancelearning/ukoptions.php that's the page
10:04  feesh: clicking on more info shows the problem
10:04  JKarsrud: Ahh, table
10:04  JKarsrud: I'm gonna grab a smoke, and I'll be right on it :)
10:05  nlogax: Xtracted: wat.. are you doing math on strings or something?
10:05  nlogax: better not do that
10:07  Xtracted: nlogax: i get offset().left from a div that has -100% offset and add -100 to that
10:07  Xtracted: nlogax: offset().left gets the value as an int, doesnt it?
10:08  nlogax: Xtracted: i think so
10:08  nlogax: Xtracted: oh, but it's not a percentage
10:08  Xtracted: nlogax: yep, it does... how do i turn the value into a % value instead of a px value?
10:09  Xtracted: nlogax: since jQuery defaults "px" to position values
10:11  nlogax: Xtracted: by mathin' i guess
10:11  nlogax: the percentage will just be 100. not very useful..?
10:12  Xtracted: nlogax: (-100) + (-100) is -200
10:12  nlogax: Xtracted: yeah
10:12  Xtracted: problem is how I turn it into -200%
10:13  nlogax: ?eval -100 + -100 + "%" // mm slutty typing
10:13  bot-t: nlogax: -200%
10:13  Jackkit001: HI
10:13  Xtracted: nlogax: problem is that + "%" makes the value into -1680
10:14  Jackkit001: Anyone use jquery address?
10:14  nlogax: Xtracted: not sure what you mean
10:14  Xtracted: nlogax: will show you a demo in a sec
10:14  nlogax: if you have to numbers and want a string with a percentage sign, just do the math first, then convert to string and add '%'
10:15  nlogax: and hand it off to whatever thing expects such a string. if you're doing animations, you can also do things like .animate({ left: "-=100%" })
10:16  JKarsrud: feesh: You there?
10:16  feesh: I am
10:16  feesh: hey man
10:16  JKarsrud: How come you're using onclick?
10:16  feesh: I don't know better <: (
10:16  doonie: onclick is for the c00lz ppl
10:16  nlogax: he's a feesh, onclick works better under the sea
10:16  JKarsrud: and not binding it with .click from jquery?
10:16  JKarsrud: nlogax: haha
10:16  feesh: what doonie said
10:17  feesh: I need to have a bit more time to play with jquery
10:17  feesh: I banged that out 10 mins to 5 yesterday :$
10:17  doonie: :)
10:17  feesh: no excuses... I suck, but cheers for helping me learn
10:17  doonie: onclick isn't satan itself, its ok to get stuff to work, then later optimize with jq :)
10:18  feesh: will do
10:18  sean`: onclick is cool
10:18  sean`: don't hate
10:18  JKarsrud: sean`: facebook geek :P
10:18  sean`: masturbate

10:22  Jackkit001: just got a problem with IE8
10:22  Jackkit001: :)
10:25  feesh: got a feeling jquery just doesn't like tables
10:25  feesh: and who could blame it
10:26  red: I'm using a tabbed structure on my site
10:26  red: is it easy to do it so, that the tabs are in different .html files and their content gets loaded only when the tab gets clicked
10:26  doonie: feesh sure it does

10:29  poppiez: hi, I'm using mousedownoutside (outside events). I want to prevent it from triggeren when mousedown on another element occurs. adding stopPropagation() to the other element doesn't work. how can I do this?
10:30  JKarsrud: feesh: I get the same error here: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/ccZtd/ so it's either a bug with divs inside td's or it's something else. Can't really see what could do it, but someone else might not now
10:30  sean`: nlogax, this u? http://www.hardartgroop.com/cd_covers/awesome_man.jpg
10:31  feesh: JKarsrud: cheers for taking time out to try it out man
10:31  Xtracted: aha, it seems that offset() doesnt work very well on negative percent values?

10:32  Xtracted: hm... it seems to convert the value into pixels..
10:32  nlogax: Xtracted: #content is 1471 px wide, 100% of that is.. 1471, that's what i get too
10:32  Altreus: Is there a quick idiom to find-or-create a DOM element, given that you know exactly where you want it to be?
10:33  Altreus: I'm looking to use a <span> that's directly after an <input>, it being the error message; but if the PHP didn't draw a <span> I want to create it.
10:33  JKarsrud: Hmm, this is weird: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/ccZtd/2/
10:34  Xtracted: nlogax: yeah, it doesnt return % values but pixel values..
10:34  nlogax: Xtracted: if you just want whatever you've set it to, css("left") should work
10:36  Xtracted: nlogax: also returns pixels
10:37  Jarda: ok, so it seems calling .buttonset() for ~800 elements at the same time gets firefox on its knees
10:37  Jarda: chrome manages without too much problems
10:37  Jarda: either I have to tweak something or implement paging..
10:37  JKarsrud: Jarda: How do you do it?
10:37  Jarda: Jackkit001: $(

10:42  _nix00: hi all, I want to extend jquery-ui. is there some manual about this ? I just find a forum http://forum.jquery.com/  , but it quite fragmented, I think
10:42  sean`: I'm bad at this
10:42  Jarda: _nix00: you mean you want to create your own widget?
10:42  _nix00: Jarda: yes
10:42  Jarda: http://bililite.com/blog/understanding-jquery-ui-widgets-a-tutorial/
10:42  Jarda: there's a tutorial
10:42  _nix00: Jarda: haha, thx.
10:42  nlogax: Xtracted: gets the browsers computedStyle or whatever it's called
10:42  Jarda: but most of all, it's $.widget('ui.mywidget', { _create: function() { do your magic with this.element } });
10:42  _nix00: Jarda: roger, I will pratice it later XD
10:43  nlogax: Xtracted: did you try the relative animation thing? seems like a much simpler solution
10:43  nlogax: if it works for you
10:45  poppiez: any way to prevent the mousedownoutside event from triggeren on a specific element? stopPropagation() on the element doesn't do the trick
10:45  poppiez: triggering*
10:47  Xtracted: The interesting thing is that it works on positive % values
10:47  nlogax: poppiez: haven't used it, but maybe you can check the event target in your main event handler? sounds like you added another on that specific element
10:48  Xtracted: only negative values that gets screwed up
10:48  nlogax: what's the difference?
10:49  poppiez: nlogax: yeah, using e.target would work, but the event object doesn't provide an e.which value which I need (to figure out if there was a right-click)

10:57  enerel: why dynamic include of iframe src does not work in IE $('#wrapper').attr('src', jumpLink);
10:57  feesh: does jquery use some kind of internal clock for animations? so if you do .slideDown() two or three in quick succession, previous animations are halted?
10:57  poppiez: sean`: useCapture?
10:58  sean`: enerel, why can't you wait longer than 5 minutes to repeat yourself?
10:58  BMCouto: sean` you own me :P

11:04  sean`: poppiez, oh
11:04  sean`: that's something else
11:05  JKarsrud: enerel: What if you use something like this instead of using jquery to set it? window.frames['testIframe'].document.location.href
11:05  sean`: poppiez, you'd have to filter the events target then
11:05  Jayflux:  Hi guys with event.preventdefault does the function nerd to have event inside as an argument

11:05  sean`: Jayflux, the function nerd?
11:05  JKarsrud: I think he means need
11:05  JKarsrud: :)
11:06  Jayflux: Sorry need
11:06  sean`: Jayflux, the event is the first argument, and you need that to preventDefault
11:06  Jayflux: Sorry preventdefault doesn't work without an argument
11:06  JKarsrud: Jayflux: If you don't specify event as an argument, you won't have access to preventDefault()
11:06  JKarsrud: It runs on the event

11:07  Jayflux: So test,

11:07  JKarsrud: Jayflux: you can call it hoolapalooza if you want, it's still sent in as the event

11:20  ElGoorf: keep clickign links ont he menu for a while and after about 20-40 clicks it'll lag up
11:20  ElGoorf: might wanna do it in a clean window cos it'll cause it to crash :P
11:22  lanmower: I require jquery code from within an iframe to affect the rest of the page, do you guys rate this is possible?
11:22  shashidhar: talented: my problem is when user clicks on certain image i need to get the associated tags which share the same class name and then select the textcontents from each
11:23  talented: so you capture the click?
11:23  ElGoorf: lanmower, im not expert, but im guessing ajax between the two pages
11:23  ElGoorf: and a server in between
11:23  lanmower: omg thats a far cry from what I intended to do...
11:24  talented: when you said contents of tag based on class name, that would have been $('.className').text() but now it's to do with the click on the image?
11:25 * ElGoorf pokes JKarsrud
11:25  lanmower: I had gone and redesigned my site to use iframes on advice I received over here, now I think I've just made a huge mistake.

11:29  lanmower: several people to the point of them getting angry when I tried to discuss keeping my current version and fixing it. My site has a music player, which needs to remain resident as you explore the site, I had jplayer set up and had a problem where some of the bindings from jplayer would no longer work once an ajax load (replacing the content section of the page, I suspect this happened because jquery would load with the page elements getting replaced) I wa
11:30  lanmower: problem I face now is I have to add songs to the music players playlist when you click on certain links in the content section.
11:30 --- BarryCarlyon_ is now known as BarryCarlyon
11:32  lanmower: the server-inbetween idea would work (albeit a little sporadically) but thats a massive task and theres at least a hundred things that could go wrong.
11:32  shashidhar: talented:ya i group Images by class name
11:33  shashidhar: talented: $('.className').click() does this className is taken automatically or we need to specify it directly bcz i dont knw which class has been clicked
11:33  ElGoorf: lanmower, tldr, you have a music player on your page, you need it to keep playing while people browse, that's the jist of it?
11:33  lanmower: pretty much :)
11:33  ElGoorf: i'd have not used iframes
11:33  lanmower: agreed, I started off not doing that.
11:34  ElGoorf: http://93.96.200.255/NotMyBaseZend/public/    is the page im workign on at this very moment, it uses ajax to load contant, while not changing page
11:34  ElGoorf: content*
11:34  talented: shashidhar, can you post a small snippet of how it's setup with a few class names?
11:34  ElGoorf: i could put a music player in the footer, and it'd always play as people clicked different menu links
11:34  talented: maybe there's something in common that can be used instead of the class name
11:35  talented: or, we just set it to all the class names
11:35  shashidhar: talented:ok
11:35  lanmower: the crux is when I'd reload the content section, jquery would also load if the page required jquery...
11:35  ElGoorf: i wouldnt put 100% behind my solution though, im having issues with it as after a few dozen clicks the browser crashes
11:36  ElGoorf: ..say again?
11:36  monkeynut: hello people, what's the most reliable way to capture an 'esc' pressed with keypress? I ask because if you go to the keypress docs it prints the value of the key pressed, esc comes back as 0 as do the function keys!
11:36  talented: ElGoorf, how many links being bound?
11:36  ElGoorf: wtf@ quit
11:36  stiang: i can’t get scrollable and tabs from jquery tools to work together. separately both work fine. is this the wrong way of doing it? $(".scrollable").scrollable(); $("#tabs ul").tabs(".items > div");
11:36  ElGoorf: there found in the menu
11:36  ElGoorf: 5 i think
11:37  ElGoorf: yes 5
11:37  stiang: with both enabled i get tab functionality, but no scrolling
11:37  talented: why do you have to iterate over them?
11:37  lanmower: ok elgoorf, I'm gonna pick your brain a bit, let me get my site back to using ajax instead of iframes and then I'll be back on track.
11:38  ElGoorf: heh ok
11:38  ElGoorf: talented, come again?
11:38  talented: the .each() call, just to bind them?

11:39  ElGoorf: you think it's a bad thing to do?
11:41  talented: well, I've just only looked at the first few lines, but I'll read the lot and see if anything else would be worth querying

11:43  ElGoorf: nor am i sure what it means, i mean im pretty sure i have control of the animation and im disposing of the old content completely

11:57  philk_: does jQuery $(xml) convert all tags into lowercase?
11:57  owzzz: it works as expected but the reference to the object.title does not show up..
11:57  owzzz: only the string "the title is: '
11:57  ElGoorf: and ur sure the title is set?
11:57  owzzz: how do I output the object.title value

12:02  nVee-work: hey guys
12:02  nVee-work: anyone here use colorbox?
12:07 @coldhead: nVee-work: yes, yes people do
12:07  monkeynut: nVee-work: you got code?
12:08  monkeynut: owzzz: are you looking for $(myelement).attr("title"); ??
12:09  Articate: could anyone help me with a check-box changing the selected element of a drop-down menu?
12:09  talented: what are you trying to do Articate?
12:09  Articate: oh, wait. I tried $(this).attr("selected", "selected");, but that would be the wrong element to do it with
12:10  owzzz: yes

12:10  Fichte: *cry
12:11  Fichte: i want to send a form via $(this).parent().parent().submit()  but it does not work
12:13  Fichte: i already console.log'ed the $(this).parent().parent()    and it is definitly the form dom element
12:13  Fichte: any clues?
12:14  talented: Fichte, can you paste the code to a paste site
12:14  Fichte: sure
12:15  nVee-work: hey coldhead, monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/Jt8yENRQ
12:15  nVee-work: I found a simple solution to just href back to the index page
12:16  nVee-work: but then it reloads the page, where one would just want it to close
12:16  Shrink: I want to add value markings below my jquery slider. How do I do that?
12:16  Fichte: not easy to paste
12:16  Fichte: http://pastebin.com/1MZbvGWc
12:16  Fichte: i tried
12:17  Fichte: there is teh form  and the file input  and in the script block the change event fr teh file input
12:17  owzzz: i know the values are getting assigned to the object.. because I've run console logs on them
12:17  Articate: $(this).attr("selected", "selected"); worked now that I'm actually doing it to the right object :)

12:23  ispirto: how can do this

12:24  nVee-work: but dont know how to close it
12:24  markj: yeah i have
12:24  nVee-work: i really hope you can help me
12:24  nVee-work: I have a lightbox which opens with a single image, 3 urls assigned with image map
12:24  markj: you just want to have a click event, and inside it do $.colorbox.close();
12:25  nVee-work: one part of the image is obviously a close button
12:25  nVee-work: so onclick="$.colorbox.close();" ?
12:25  markj: well

12:34  lazymanc: hi, if I have a selector $(this).prev() how do I get just the dom object and not have the jquery wrapper?
12:36  talented: do you know what the previous sibling is?
12:36  daxroc: Morning
12:36  lazymanc: e.g. if "this" is a HTMLOptionElement I just want the previous HTMLOptionElement, not inside a jquery wrapper
12:37  talented: why not in the wrapper?
12:37  lazymanc: i'm passing it to the function swapNodes() listed in answer 4 here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/698301/is-there-a-native-jquery-function-to-switch-elements
12:38  lazymanc: and it doesn't seem to like the jquery object
12:38  lazymanc: I guess I can just use this.previousSibling() instead of jquery
12:39  lazymanc: but it would be handy to know how to get the raw dom element anyway
12:39  talented: well, you can use jquery to get the element you're on, identify it by the value I assume?
12:39  daxroc: I'm loading a google map in a jquery ui dialog. On first load it's fine , when I close the dialog ( the containers and map canvas (div) are removed when I try add the map again the google map seems to be squashed into the top left of the dialog ?
12:40  daxroc: seems to return to normal operation when I resize the browser window ?
12:41  daxroc: Happens in both Chrome, and FF
12:42  daxroc: can you have javascript to redraw the entire page ?
12:43  talented: lazymanc,  if you're only swapping option elements, why not just swap the values, etc... no need for moving the nodes around
12:47  lazymanc: talented: is swapping the value & content & selected status and classes faster than just swapping nodes?
12:47  talented: well, you can find the index of where you are, and append it to where you want it to be and append the other node to the index

14:32  coconutz: i wonder if its there a reason why all facebook games are in flash and not jquery and stuff
14:33  unfo-: timing, np
14:34  Jarda: coconutz: because of browser restrictions
14:35  Jarda: I mean, your only option will be runnign the game in iframe and that has it's restrictions
14:35  Jarda: but it is possible via the javascript api facebook offers, but I heard it's sucky too :D
14:36  coconutz: so if i can builda jquery game i should go for it?
14:36  coconutz: instad of flash?
14:37  Jarda: well.. I have no experience whatsoever..
14:38  markj: coconutz it really depends on what you want to do
14:38  Nomikos: I'm using the jquery ui sortable thinger, and it works, but some elements in the rest of the page, underneath the sortable items, jump up and down when I drag and drop items

14:43  boairc: what is the selector for all forms that DO NOT have id="xxx" ?
14:44  Hex_101: How would I change a variable inside a function, to affect the function again? I'm using setInterval, and changing the variable 'number' however, it just goes back to what it was set before the setInterval was ran
14:44  Nomikos: boairc: $('form').not('[id=xxx]').etc
14:44  markj: ?paste @ Hex_101
14:44  bot-t: Hex_101, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
14:44  boairc: let me try
14:45  KeeperOfTheSoul_: Hex_101: the variable would have to be declared in a scope outside the callback function
14:45  Hex_101: http://jsfiddle.net/zJqN9/ markj :) thanks.
14:45  Hex_101: markj: basically, I'm trying to change the background image on a ticker... but so far can't get it to alternate yet, relaly bad code I know..
14:45  Nomikos: Hex_101: that, or use closures. (which I will not try to explain, but I think they could help here)
14:47  boairc: Nomikos: won't work. actually i need to apply on the fields inside the forms
14:48  boairc: what are closures? link please
14:48  Nomikos: boairc: hmm.. I'd have thought by chaining a find('input') in between that would work but a quick test here does not work, for me
14:49  juha_: boairc: var something = function() { /** this is a closure*/ }
14:49  juha_: ?closure @ boairc

14:49  boairc: ok...
14:49  Nomikos: boairc: no, wait, that /should/ work. got sample code?
14:49  boairc: isn't there a CSS selector for not?
14:49  Nomikos: (I made a mistake)
14:50  boairc: $('form input[type!=hidden], form select, form textarea').after(function(){ return 'x'; });
14:51  Nomikos: I'm not sure you can use commas inside the selector like that?
14:51  Nomikos: ehr, nm
14:51  Hex_101: KeeperOfTheSoul_: I thought that's what I did, I declared ouside the document.ready function, but it seems to always reset to 2.
14:52  Hex_101: KeeperOfTheSoul_: even though it is changed to 1
14:52  boairc: yes u can
14:52  boairc: CSS rule. enumeration.
14:52  Nomikos: yeah
14:52  Nomikos: (only on my second cup of coffee..)
14:53  boairc: i'm on 3rd :D
14:53  Nomikos: but basically you want to find all the non-hidden fields, and some other things, and put some html behind it
14:54  boairc: all form fields (incl. select and textarea) except hidden ones
14:54  boairc: but i have a form that should not be touched
14:55  boairc: found the solution
14:55  boairc: $('form[id!=proxyform] input[type!=hidden], form[id!=proxyform] select, form[id!=proxyform] textarea').after ...
14:56  Nomikos: boairc: yeah - beat me to it
14:56  Nomikos: :)
14:56  boairc: [id!=value]
14:56  boairc: i actually had it under my nose, i see now. look at that type!=hidden
14:56  boairc: funny thing is that i wrote that too lol
14:56  boairc: just forgot

15:21  friendlystranger: form has a submit event
15:22  friendlystranger: so $('form').submit( function(e){ e.preventDefault } );
15:25  Nomikos: You can also just return false, like $('form').submit(function() {return false;}); , right?
15:25  Nomikos: I guess the function body could do more useful things like check the values, and return true or false based on those

15:42  serio: odd question
15:42  serio: it's dependant on the element itself.
15:42  serio: different elements have different attributes.

15:58  Jonz: affa,  I'm not sure it's even possible with javascript, my advice would be to use a switch statement
15:58  Jonz: possible or not, it's hella confusing, so I wouldn't even try to do it if I was you
15:59  hdon: affa, "same name as an object" -- by that do you mean, you want to evaluate a string to get the value of the named global variable?
15:59  affa: yes
15:59  affa: eval?
16:00  hdon: affa, eval is the obvious choice, but unless you are writing a debugging/development tool, you don't want that. in fact you don't want to be naming arbitrary global variables at all. make yourself an object to put the stuff in you might want to reference, then use foo[stringNamingThingYouWant]
16:00  thyphus: .sortable('cancel') will undo the last change. how do i undo ALL changes? is that possible?
16:01  hdon: thyphus, not a jquery ui expert, but can you add a hidden column that contains values indicating some original order?

16:14  BlaDe^: Oh, sweet
16:15  BlaDe^: and FINAl question heh, how can I check if webkit is supported?
16:15  BlaDe^: rather than finding out which browser it is and checking them against webkit, etc
16:16  hdon: BlaDe^, i dont' understand your question
16:16  BlaDe^: input type=search only works on browsers with webkit (chrome/safari, etc) right now -- and it's due for implementation in FF4
16:17  hdon: BlaDe^, and what do you want to do in javascript?
16:17  BlaDe^: so I want to check if the user has webkit (It's available in user-agent but i'm wonder if there's a better way)
16:17  KeeperOfTheSoul_: BlaDe^: should do feature detection, so test if search is supported rather than test if it is webkit
16:17  hdon: BlaDe^, you want the css thing that checks for browser probably
16:17  BlaDe^: how do I do that KeeperOfTheSoul  ?
16:17 * hdon looks
16:17  KeeperOfTheSoul_: not sure how you test which input types are supported though
16:17  hdon: does anyone know what it's called?
16:17  hdon: it checks for the browser and then gives your body element a css attribute indicating the browser?
16:18  BlaDe^: if search isn't supported I want to use a class and i'll imitate some of the styling as a fallback
16:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: BlaDe^: looks like more than you care to know about html5 feature detection http://diveintohtml5.org/detect.html

16:20  BlaDe^: yeah it looks excellent
16:23  dilvie: Quick question. I just realized that my detection for an empty (but existent) required attribute is evaluating false on some browsers. Anybody know a great cross-browser way to return true if an attribute exists, even if the attribute is empty?

16:25  nbari: any alternativ for the jquery.validation plugin  that could allow to reutilize the same form
16:25  Recca: I understand thatthese things may have security restictions, but in that case I am not sure why it would allow the request but deny the content.
16:26  nbari: Is just that I simple can not make work the resetForm() method
16:26  hdon: sean`, i can't type back-tick in q3a mods, so i don't acknowledge it
16:26  hdon: except in the shell
16:26  sean`: HMPF`
16:26  Recca: The content is definitely there but it beingignored by jQuery/FF as firebug shows content length set as not empty but response data as empty
16:26  sean`: bot-t, do you acknowledge me?
16:26  bot-t: sean`, My sources say no.
16:26  Recca: packet sniffing also shows content
16:26  sean`: bot-t, you're so lucky I don't have awps
16:26  bot-t: sean`, Is that a question?
16:26  sean`: OMG
16:26  hdon: sean`, except when my shell doesn't support leading-space-means-no-history-entry, i use `line`
16:27  sean`: hdon, I don't think your shell likes it when you talk about her secrets like that
16:27  hdon: sean`, well if she knew how to keep my secrets for me without me having to type more characters... i don't get tab completion from "line" you know!
16:28  sean`: yeah

16:37  Jonz: gears was a rad project
16:37  hdon: twas
16:37  Jonz: i'm not sure i'm ready to do my crypto on the client-side yet
16:38  hdon: lol, where else can you do it that matters?
16:38  Jonz: on the server with sessions I guess
16:38  hdon: who would you be getting privacy from then?
16:39  nbari: some one here using the validate() plugint ? any idea of how to properly call the resetFom() ?
16:39  hdon: nbari, resetForm()
16:39 * hdon lols
16:39  nbari: howto make it work ?
16:39  nbari: is just that I have been trying to call it in meny diferent ways but it is not working
16:40  hdon: nbari, i don't know the plugin you speak of. sorry for my poor joke. "how properly call fnctionFoo()?" "spell it correctly, hahaha" :(
16:40  nbari: id does not resets the form
16:40  nbari: no problem :)
16:40  danheberden: nbari - are you asking how to natively reset the form?
16:40  danheberden: using the browsers 'reset form' feature?
16:41  nbari: http://jsfiddle.net/DFc6m/
16:41  nbari: when using the form[0].reset() works
16:41  danheberden: ya, thats how ya do it
16:41  nbari: but the validations rules stop working
16:41  nbari: and a user can bypass the form
16:41  hdon: nbari, did you try $(this).resetForm() instead of $(this).validate().resetForm()?
16:42  nbari: yes still does not work
16:42  hdon: nbari, in case it is not already clear to you, the intrepid user can always bypass the form if they care to :)
16:42  nbari: also added a button so if clicked, try to reset the form
16:42  hdon: nbari, download original plugin source code and see how to reset for yourself. the source code is always a good reference :)
16:43  nbari: what about the jpForm plugin ?
16:43  nbari: could be a good alternative ?
16:44  hdon: i prefer validate plugin, but never had a need for form reset. form reset is so 1990s... :P
16:44  nbari: in some sites I have found that it is not recomended to reutilize the same form, to better reload the page
16:45  hdon: i have not heard that advice
16:45  hdon: i use the same forms all the time
16:45  hdon: of course, all of my forms just do ajax, so...
16:45  hdon: who knows what they are worried about or if it applies to me
16:45  nbari: I see, so all your validations are with the remote right ?
16:46  hdon: nbari, no, i validate both on client and server
16:46  nbari: and ever tryied to reuse the same form after a submit ?
16:46  hdon: nbari, i use $('form').submit(function(){...}) to handle form submission, then submit the data with $.ajax()
16:46  n_time: hello.
16:46  nbari: yes that is what I am doing to
16:46  hdon: nbari, doing it this way i have explained, i reuse forms all the time.
16:47  nbari: I start to notice this problems when a from was not doing the proper validation and the ajax returned an error based on a duplicity of a record
16:48  nbari: so that is why I want to reset the form so users who try to submit the dame data, get a error msg
16:48  hdon: nbari, so you want to avoid form-resubmission of the same request?
16:49  nbari: right
16:49  nbari: the fist time the user submit the data, the fiels are validated
16:49  hdon: nbari, disable the ability to submit then, and reenable the ability in your ajax "complete" even thandler
16:49  nbari: but after the data is submited, the validation rules some how are gone
16:50  hdon: perhaps it is the validate plugin that is having the problem then. i am not using it on my current project. i wrote my own for our project.
16:50  nbari: for example the firt time the user inputs data on the form the validations rules work, but after  submiting (passsing all the validations) he gets an OK msg but if the user wants to submit mor data, then the validations do not work anymore
16:51  hdon: nbari, you should create a fiddle to show your problem. instead of submitting to a server with .ajax(), just set a delay and then run your ajax success handler with phony data. then demonstrate form validation stop working
16:51  nbari: ok
16:52  tristan_: what method do i call to only return the numbers in a case where there are letters and numbers?
16:52  tristan_: parseInt will only work if the numbers are first, in this case the numbers are trailing
16:53  hdon: bbl
16:53  ablomen: tristan_, "asd325erwhaGE ewgw45".replace(/[^\d]/g, "");
16:54  tristan_: awesome, lemme try!
16:54  ablomen: or "asd325erwhaGE ewgw45".replace(/[\D]/g, ""); too actually
16:55  tristan_: worked like a charm, tyvm
16:56  ablomen: np, you will still have to parseInt it btw if you want a real number
16:57  ablomen: (and you can also remove the [ and ] to save 2 extra characters!)

17:27  etcetera: http://blog.westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/
17:27  SugaSlide: what are you trying to do?
17:27  etcetera: anyone know of a similar framework?
17:28  Bartmax: SugaSlide, pretty simple : input[type="number"] when modifing the value, call a simple function.
17:28  Bartmax: there are 2 ways to modify that value on HTML5 capable browser and 1 on the others.

17:39  danheberden: well i see tr, then siblings, then val
17:39  danheberden: and that === uh uh
17:39  danheberden: a tr can't have a sibling of a form element
17:39  danheberden: and you got the idea with closest
17:39  danheberden: use that instead of parent
17:40  Clorith: yeha, closest has helped me a lot
17:40  monkeynut: Clorith: don't you just want    $('.make_activity').click( function(){  $(this).siblings('.activity'); /*<-- .activity input */  });
17:40  ceej: which one is better?  $('#claim-files .file-change-permission') or $('#file-change-permission') ?
17:40  monkeynut: ceej, the question implies a usage misunderstanding.
17:41  Clorith: The .activity isnt' a sibling, as it's in another <tr>
17:41  Clorith: or am I misunderstanding the use of .siblings?

17:41  danheberden: Clorith: sure? http://gyazo.com/91fc08b5abd5bc3231864e81ed5306aa.png
17:41  ceej: monkeynut: file-change-permissions will be unique
17:42  ceej: so is the later quicker?
17:42  monkeynut: ceej, the first one finds elements with class 'file-change-permission' who are children of given id, the second just finds an element by id.
17:42  ceej: latter*
17:42  monkeynut: ceej, using id is always the quickest, if that's what you're after.
17:42  ceej: yee
17:42  ceej: I thought so... thank you
17:42  Clorith: Tried the .siblings without any success =(
17:43  monkeynut: but there is the caveat that all id searches will be slower if you have a huge id hash-table, ceej
17:43  ceej: monkeynut: but still the latter would be quicker :)
17:44  Bartmax: anyone have an idea of the input problem ? http://jsfiddle.net/DSsnS/
17:44  monkeynut: ceej, say you had a table with 5000 rows, if each has a unique id unnecessarily, then getting by id will be slower than it should be.
17:44  KeeperOfTheSoul_: is there a simple table around that lists all xhr.status codes?
17:45  KeeperOfTheSoul_: including the various browser specific ones?
17:45  ceej: monkeynut: so situations like that it should be contained in one id and they should all be classes?

17:45  monkeynut: ceej, ideally, take design clarity is better than slightly faster. Remember web-apps are not power-houses.  Cleanest code design will ultimately result in the better application.
17:46  monkeynut: ceej, i'd have one id for the table, and reference each row by their index, in the example I gave (at least, if speed is the priority and knowing the index is easy)
17:47  monkeynut: ceej, you seem to have the idea, I may be over-complicating things for no good reason as I haven't examined your code.  Just wanted to caveat my statement.  Good luck :)

18:50  janthony: Hrm, what is the best method to add something from a dom to a specified selector in a popup window?
18:52  dilvie: In case anybody else is wondering how to check for an empty attribute, this is how I did it: required = ($this.filter('[required]')) ? true : false,
18:53  ajpiano: wouldn't $this.is("[required]") work in that case as well?
18:53  ajpiano: dilvie: that doesn't actually work bro
18:53  mod: Why would this return 'pnav' ?  $(this).parents('#pnav li.top-level').attr('id')
18:53  dilvie: ajpiano: it doesn't?
18:53  mod: the id of li.top-level is not 'pnav'
18:53  ajpiano: jquery objects are always truthy, you're not checking .length in that expression
18:53  ajpiano: dilvie: that test is the same as var foo = true ? true : false;
18:54  dilvie: ajpiano: it worked in chrome, firefox, opera, ie, mac and pc
18:54  ajpiano: define worked?
18:54  Kingsy_: anyone in here used tabs.js ? the jquery script for a tab system?
18:54  dilvie: functioned as expected. Returns false when it should, returns true when it should.
18:55  ajpiano: that doesn't really make sense
18:55  jqp: mod: the returned parent may have id pnav -- the selector you've got returns an element with ID that has a descendant LI element with class top-level
18:55  jqp: with id pnav*
18:55  dilvie: ajpiano: checking .length would fail, because the spec allows required to be empty.
18:56  ajpiano: you need to check the length of the jquery collection you filtere
18:56  ajpiano: filtered
18:56  ajpiano: that's why iam saying to just use is
18:56  dilvie: ajpiano: oh =)
18:56  dilvie: ajpiano: so am I depending on a jquery bug with that line?

19:02  serio: hilarious.
19:02  dilvie: ajpiano: I've noticed. I've changed my logic here three times I think.
19:03  ajpiano: dilvie: ^^ if .is() failed on IE, it will also fail with .filter()
19:03  ajpiano: because .is() is just calling filter
19:03  dilvie: Really?
19:03  ajpiano: look at the src ^^
19:03  dilvie: Maybe my brain failed again.
19:04  dilvie: ajpiano: I really appreciate your help. =)
19:04  dilvie: Very constructive.
19:04  ajpiano: np man
19:04  ajpiano: dilvie: i think h5validate is a really solid idea in principle, i want to see it..work :)
19:05  dilvie: ajpiano: Oh, does is fail if the value exists, but is falsey?
19:05  dilvie: some browsers set empty attributes to false, I believe
19:05  dilvie: which is why I had to change the logic the first time.
19:05  ajpiano: i'm not too sure, it's kind ofa clusterfuck
19:05  dilvie: LOL
19:05  dilvie: I'll just check the length.

19:11  dilvie: sha1sum: If you're asking about h5Validate, you can pass an array of good values to the .h5Validate.validValues() function with a selector. It will dynamically create a regex pattern for you and test using the same validation function that's used for everything else.
19:12  dilvie: h5Validate is currently broken. Will post a fixed version in about 10-20 minutes, depending on how long it takes me to do my cross-browser checks.
19:12  dilvie: this time watching for false positives a bit more closely (thanks, ajpiano)
19:13  ajpiano: :)
