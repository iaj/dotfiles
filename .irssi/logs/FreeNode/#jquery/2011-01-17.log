00:05  jordan-: i'm binding a click event to an element that activates an element within it.. how can i make it not trigger the click event when i click on the child element
00:06  coldhead: ?preventdefault
00:06  coldhead: >: |
00:06  jordan-: i've tried: $('ul#breadcrumbs li.dropdown:not("ul#breadcrumbs div.expanded")') and $('ul#breadcrumbs li.dropdown').not('ul#breadcrumbs div.expanded')
00:06  bot-t: event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
00:06  coldhead: jordan-: simplify the not, use just 'div.expanded'
00:08  piklu: is there some workalohalic kind of person here ? I need to ask something, please respond if u think u are always doing work
00:08  jordan-: hmm still not working...
00:08  jordan-: $('ul#breadcrumbs li.dropdown:not(div.expanded)')
00:09  coldhead: jordan-: i don't see exactly what you're trying to do
00:09  coldhead: see if the preventDefault link above is relevant to you
00:10  coldhead: failing that, use jsfiddle.net
00:10  coldhead: or experiment with the JS console in your browser
00:10  coldhead: $('ul#breadcrumbs li.dropdown:not(div.expanded)').length, $('ul#breadcrumbs li.dropdown').length, $('div.expanded').length should help figure it out
00:11  jordan-: http://pastebin.com/nVJxfT1u
00:14  jordan-: it's just triggering the toggle event even if i click in div.expanded
00:16  jordan-: (and div.expanded is lively inputted into the page
00:16  jordan-: )
00:21  jordan-: ??
00:22  coldhead: oh SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING JORDAN
00:22  coldhead: I WAS JUST FIXING YOUR SHIT FOR FREE IN MY OWN TIME
00:22  coldhead: I'LL TRY TO BE FASTER NEXT TIME
00:22  coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/bLKf6/1/
00:22  coldhead: that's kind of crude but it works
00:23  coldhead: i just bound to the actual <a> and changed all the $(this) to $(this).parent('li')

00:42  Qjimbo: Hey all
00:43  Qjimbo: I'm trying to use .each() however I can't find out how to loop through the list elements in one particlar <ul>
00:43  GreenRanger: does the UL have an id?
00:44  Qjimbo: yep
00:44  nfiniteset: $('ul li').each(function(){this.dosomething})
00:45  Qjimbo: woo it works, thanks :)
00:45  nfiniteset: np =)
00:45  jordan-: sorry i wasn't at the computer
00:45  jordan-: i expect more free work from you
00:45  jordan-: a life times worth
00:46  nfiniteset: you get why it worked qjim? need an explination?
00:46  jordan-: i made it so it doesn't lively insert it now
00:46  jordan-: had to change my whole breadcrumbs "library"
00:46  jordan-: !
00:46  GreenRanger: I've been trying for hours, but keep running into problems.  Isn't there some straight forward way to disable all the default stuff that happens when clicking and dragging on an element? (highlight, drag image, etc...)?
00:47  Qjimbo: I think I get it, basically it treats element types and ids kind of like the way css treats classes, right?
00:47  nfiniteset: exactly
00:47  nfiniteset: you can pass any css-style selector to the $() function
00:48  nfiniteset: classes too
00:49  nfiniteset: in fact, it can be a little shorter if you simply need to call a function on all items returned. e.g. $('ul li').each().dosomething()

01:22  Bigsista: lo
01:24  Bigsista: i have coded an ajax request to refresh the contents of a div. firebug on ff gives me "success" on textStatus and refreshes.
01:25  Bigsista: ie insteat gives "error" in textStatus" and does not refresh, although firebug lite shows the correct html-response from the server
01:25  Bigsista: anyone have an idea why?
01:25  Bigsista: sorry meant "instead"
01:26  Bigsista: i don't know, where to look for the "error" response in ie anymore. spent hours on that now... =(

01:41  nfiniteset: crankharder: a few things, one, do you have a reason for changing the font-weight property from within js?
01:41  nfiniteset: i would add or remove a class
01:42  nfiniteset: two: i think you have a syntax error, try: css({'font-weight', 'normal'})

01:42  nfiniteset: oops, no curly brackets
01:43 --- johnathanb is now known as Johnathan
01:43  nfiniteset: oh and another thing, i would use css.('font-weight', 500) rather than 'normal'
01:43  crankharder: nfiniteset: it's defined in css as bold.  yes, i can remove the class, but I'd rather animate() the change
01:44  nfiniteset: oh... huh. i havnt seen font-weight animate before... i would be surprised if it were possible

03:49  paul_irish: lis is a jquery object with all the <li>s of the page in it
03:50  Back2Basics: why is the last declaration in there?  "li" all by itself?
03:50  lump`: what's the li all abot?
03:50  lump`: yeh exactly what i was thinking
03:50  lump`: just being instantiated in global context?

03:51  paul_irish: so its like.. heads up guys.. we're gonna use this dude later.

04:09  mutandi: so im new to jquery, but ive been reading and doing tutorials. what's the most common way a feature like facebook's wall comments can be implemented? where you click on the empty comment box and then a form appears
04:11  tbranyen: mutandi: $("textarea").click(function() { $(".formbits").addClass("show"); });
04:11  tbranyen: something like that maybe
04:11  mutandi: ok so it'd be something like an addClass, not a toggle?
04:12  tbranyen: well addClass affords more flexability in my opinion
04:13  mutandi: can you explain a little? i guess i don't understand how adding a CSS class could make a form appear
04:15  tbranyen: mutandi: well learn css :) and do something like .formbits { display: inline-block; } or w/e
04:16  mutandi: tbranyen: fair enough. can you elaborate on why addClass has more flexibility than toggle?
04:17  tbranyen: mutandi: well you can do what toggle does with addClass and much more, so...
04:17  mutandi: i see
04:18  RoaDin: okay, I'm trying to find how you populate a textarea with a jquery/Json request? anyone can point me to the right way, I've googled many diffrent ways and cannot find anything about it.

06:18  disappearedng: does html form allow you to do submission like [a][b] = 1, [a][c] = 2, [b][b] = 3, [b][c] = 4?
06:18  coldhead: clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);
06:18  coldhead: that's making it disappear
06:18  Forbidd3n: is that a bug in the 1.8.8
06:18  coldhead: i don't know why UI is doing that currently and i wish they'd stop it
06:19  coldhead: i don't know
06:19  coldhead: ajpiano?
06:19  coldhead: i fucking hate UI
06:19  Forbidd3n: get rid of both clips?
06:19  coldhead: yup
06:19  coldhead: i mean maybe blind people in wheelchairs need that line to be there
06:19  coldhead: but fuck those guys
06:19  Forbidd3n: lol
06:20  Forbidd3n: thanks that worked.
06:20  Forbidd3n: that must be a bug, what would be a reason they would input that?
06:20  coldhead: can haz $1,000,000?
06:20  coldhead: no idea
06:20  Forbidd3n: thanks coldhead
06:20 * Forbidd3n password protecting the dir so coldhead doesn't twitter it. :)
06:20  coldhead: no problemo
06:21  coldhead: http://twitter.com/coldhead
06:21  coldhead: very little chance i'll be doing that
06:21  disappearedng: Hey I have a gigantic form where the user clicks to submit whether or not he wants to invite this user, but I want 2 pieces of additional information: first_name and last_name per each checked input box, anyway to do this neatly?
06:21  coldhead: i didn't even tweet about ipads apparently
06:21  Forbidd3n: lol
06:21  coldhead: disappearedng: <input type="hidden" ...
06:22  joshsmith: disappearedng: why do you have a giant form?
06:22  joshsmith: shouldn't invites be simple?
06:22  disappearedng: from facebook
06:22  coldhead: joshsmith++
06:23  coldhead: oh cool, facebook
06:23  joshsmith: if it's FB then it should be even simpler
06:23  disappearedng: so I must come up with some first_name_123123 = X last_name_123123 = Y like that
06:23  joshsmith: or maybe I'm just not skilled in the graph API enough
06:24  coldhead: the graph API is an infinite black hole of pain
06:24  disappearedng: don't I submit everything then even if the user didn't check your box since it's filled in?
06:24  disappearedng: I think you can say most apis are like that
06:24  coldhead: disappearedng: .attr('disabled', 'disabled')
06:24  coldhead: as required
06:24  joshsmith: the Amazon FPS API is even more painful
06:24  disappearedng: wait what does that do ?
06:24  coldhead: i highly doubt that
06:25  coldhead: disappearedng: disabled attributes are not submitted
06:25  disappearedng: you mean like <input type=text value=XXX hidden>
06:25  joshsmith: its silly when one of the first three or four users of my newly launched feature is the founder of a competitor site
06:25  coldhead: no i do not
06:25  disappearedng: but I only want to submit when the user checks the box
06:25  coldhead: type="hidden" disabled="disabled"
06:25  coldhead: hhahahaha that means you're doing it right, joshsmith
06:25  coldhead: good luck!
06:26  coldhead: vladikoff: can you help disappearedng?
06:26  coldhead: i'm too stupid
06:26  joshsmith: coldhead: either that or very, very wrong
06:26  joshsmith: coldhead: what's funny is that he must have showed it to two of his friends, one of whom is a Stanford prof. and they both signed up, and both added the same goal...
06:28  coldhead: link, joshsmith!
06:28  joshsmith: coldhead: http://www.goals.com/support/438/Meditate-daily
06:28  coldhead: or is this their private data?
06:28  coldhead: nhahahhahahahahahha
06:28  coldhead: that's precious
06:28  joshsmith: no, it's public, it's goal-sharing
06:28  coldhead: meditation is so hot at stanford
06:28  joshsmith: he's the founder of GoalMafia
06:28  coldhead: just like global warming
06:28  coldhead: ugh what a dreadful name
06:29  joshsmith: and also a kind of...weird...idea
06:29  joshsmith: not to knock the guy, I know what he was going for
06:29  coldhead: well to those people who meet their goals best when intimidated by organised crime, i salute you
06:29  joshsmith: but blue & white & happy clouds vs. black & more black & "executing"
06:29  joshsmith: kinda crazy
06:33  joshsmith: btw, how do you like how it's coming along, coldhead
06:35  coldhead: it looks nice
06:35  coldhead: i'm annoyed that i need to login to see more
06:35  coldhead: but it is ever thus
06:36  coldhead: does it have facebook and twitter integration?
06:36  joshsmith: coldhead: just the share links like you see there
06:36  joshsmith: so that's not really integration
06:36  coldhead: we had to workshop a similar project
06:37  joshsmith: really? for what?
06:37  coldhead: and mgmt were very keen to have our facebook "friends" "support" our "goaks"
06:37  coldhead: goals*
06:37  coldhead: it was a team building thing, christ knows
06:37  joshsmith: hahah
06:37  joshsmith: where do you work, or can you say?
06:38  coldhead: in terms of elevator pitches, how does your site distinguish itself from 43things.com
06:38  joshsmith: I'm also doing fundraising for personal projects http://www.goals.com/support/5/Launch-Goals
06:38  coldhead: nowhere interesting, js
06:38  coldhead: i want high res pictures of molly rudesill
06:38  coldhead: that's my new goal
06:38  joshsmith: hahah
06:39  joshsmith: she's my fiancée
06:39  coldhead: you fortunate man
06:39  joshsmith: the fundraising is a pretty good differentiator from 43things
06:39  SugaSlide: just doesnt know it yet?
06:39  SugaSlide: :P
06:39  joshsmith: this would lead me to believe she does: http://www.goals.com/support/18/Plan-our-wedding
06:40  okaycool: which will be a good way/plugin to skin <select> fields with own CSS styling?
06:40  joshsmith: but looking ahead, coldhead, one big thing we're going to do is actually function as a recommendations engine for discovering new things in life: new goals, new places, new things to do with friends
06:41  coldhead: i think you should be proud, joshsmith, its very nice looking
06:41  joshsmith: coldhead: gracias. this specific feature has been a couple weeks in the works
06:41  coldhead: if i was forced to give one suggestion i'd sake use rounded corners on your inputs
06:41  coldhead: for newer browsers
06:41  coldhead: i'd say*
06:41  joshsmith: yeah, I tried the rounded corners, but I wasn't pleased
06:42  joshsmith: I made them the same radius as the selects and it still looked weird
06:42  joshsmith: I did make sure to have the button have the same radius as the select though
06:42  coldhead: http://gyazo.com/bba58947703c4d8b9f3e2e3955783342.png
06:42  coldhead: that looks better to me, with 3px
06:43  coldhead: but i am not a designer
06:43  coldhead: obv.
06:43  joshsmith: oh gotcha, that input
06:43  joshsmith: hmm that does look a tad better, actually
06:43  coldhead: we have an expensive designer here and he rounds all his inputs
06:43 * coldhead steals
06:43  joshsmith: are all the fonts rendering properly for you? Molly is on the exact same version of Chrome and the top font wasn't rendering
06:44 * joshsmith steals where it's convenient
06:44  coldhead: i think i'm on the beta chrome
06:44  joshsmith: the whole site is now basically a mashup of FB, Twitter, and Kickstarter
06:44  git__: hi
06:44  coldhead: it looks fine by me
06:44  joshsmith: design-wise
06:45  coldhead: that's what the peoples want!
06:45  joshsmith: but I am only like six months into this whole design/development thing and working alone, so whatever
06:45  git__: anyone know how to do jquery ajax plus having the url of the next page ?
06:45  joshsmith: git__: I'm not sure what you mean
06:45  letterpress: joshsmith: the @fontface should be MyriadWebProRegular not MyriadWebPro
06:45  coldhead: i think you've a pretty good instinct, joshsmith
06:45  coldhead: we see a lot of crappy crap crap iin here
06:45  letterpress: on .support-user-text
06:46  joshsmith: letterpress: ahhh that's what I did wrong
06:46  joshsmith: thank you!
06:46  letterpress: np
06:46  git__: i have a "Save and Continue" button on page "step1", it processes form inputs in "step1", I want it to go to "step2" after it finishes processing jquery ajax request
06:46  joshsmith: I've gotten that wrong everywhere then
06:46  coldhead: fancy someone called letterpress helping out with fonts <3
06:46  joshsmith: why does it render fine for me sometimes, though?
06:46  coldhead: letterpress++
06:46  letterpress: should be handset in type metal, but oh well
06:47  joshsmith: gah, I habitually wrote "MyriadWebPro" throughout my CSS
06:47  harmaz: i want to make a <tr> visible/invisible on hover, but this implementation blinks rapidly: https://gist.github.com/782533
06:48  letterpress: you can just change the name of the font-family in your @font-face declaration, right? the stylesheet.css? or is that generated on the fly by fontsquirrel or something?
06:49  letterpress: @font-face { font-family: 'MyriadWebPro'; ...
06:49  coldhead: ?ba debounce @ harmaz
06:49  bot-t: harmaz, Don't fire that event any more than you have to! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
06:49  joshsmith: ah, I actually didn't do it throughout my code
06:49  joshsmith: 4 places
06:50  joshsmith: odd
06:50  joshsmith: I don't think I used MyriadWebProRegular much before, though, is why it's just happening now
06:50  joshsmith: everything on the goal pages was way too bold previously
06:50 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
06:51  joshsmith: coldhead: did you see my response re: 43things?
06:53  coldhead: yes i did
06:53  coldhead: well said
06:53  joshsmith: *bows*
06:53  joshsmith: just wanted to see if you thought that made sense
06:53  coldhead: it does
06:53  coldhead: i'm just flagging that as something people might say
06:54  coldhead: 43things was the first thing i thought of
06:54  joshsmith: yeah, and I like people asking that, because it's not immediately clear what the difference is
06:54  joshsmith: but after a little more development time, it should become painfully clear
06:55 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
06:55  git__: i have a "Save and Continue" button on page "step1", it processes form inputs in "step1", I want it to go to "step2" after it finishes processing jquery ajax request
06:55  coldhead: use the success callback, git__
06:55  joshsmith: I'm really looking forward to launch this whole goal supporters/fundraising thing
06:56  joshsmith: but also nervous
06:56  coldhead: why so nervous?
06:56  git__: coldhead, i got the success callback ... what do i do in it ?
06:56  coldhead: just have a few steadying magnums of champagne
06:56  joshsmith: two things I need to be sure of before it launches fully is making sure I have some failover in case of crazy traffic
06:56  coldhead: window.location = 'somenewpage' ?
06:56  git__: coldhead, to a send a "<meta refresh ..."
06:56  joshsmith: and also being absolutely sure the FPS stuff works properly and I'm handling for all the errors
06:57  coldhead: git__: it's cleaner to do it in JS
06:57  coldhead: if you're already doing AJAX
06:57  git__: coldhead, ah
06:57  git__: let me try
06:57  coldhead: joshsmith: soft launch?
06:57  joshsmith: right now I'm running on a little Linode
06:57  joshsmith: yeah, just not really sure what a soft launch means in this context
06:58  coldhead: it means if something goes wrong you can say "lucky this was just the soft launch!"
06:58  joshsmith: like maybe I should take out some Facebook ads or something and see how that works out
06:59  coldhead: also you don't do any cocaine off naked super models in the soft launch phase
06:59  joshsmith: rather than being like, "Excuse me, TC, can you please wreck my life"
06:59  coldhead: FB ads are pretty cheap and effective
06:59  coldhead: (stupid jerks)
06:59  joshsmith: yeah I've run them before
06:59  joshsmith: thinking I should maybe do it for this page http://www.goals.com/support/goalsignup.php
06:59  joshsmith: rather than Goals proper
07:00  joshsmith: orrrr I should run two separate ads to A/B test

07:15  coldhead: how dare you disrespect someone on their first day

07:32  NemesisD: is there a way to do something like live() but for when elements matching a selector enter the dom?
07:33  NemesisD: any time i have an element of a certain class enter the dom i want to render some svg in it
07:33  coldhead: there isn't really, NemesisD
07:34  coldhead: the jquery way to do it would be to .trigger('something') when you add the elements
07:34  coldhead: and .bind('trigger', doStuff)
07:34  NemesisD: oh i see
07:34  coldhead: .bind('something', doStuff), even

09:22  Rixius: a documentFragment is actually DOM elements instead of a string?
09:22 * Rixius may be misunderstanding the question
09:24  sean`: astropirate, that question isn't relevant..
09:24  sean`: astropirate, when using jQuery you'd use a string, because jQuery internally does the magic for you

09:45  Aquaguy: mmm doesn't work for me

10:11  deisy: hi guys im passing in a variable which is a number I want to add it to this code $("select[id=subcategory]").val(); doing something like this $("select[id=subcategory'+currentline']")
10:11  twoface: Hi. Shouldn't $("#box1").find(".test1,.test2") only match elements classes .test1 and .test2 inside #box1? It seems only the first class (test1) does what it is supposed to. See http://jsfiddle.net/HuHMS/ for an example
10:14  deisy: any help?
10:15  twoface: ah, my problem seems to be due to .live() not working well with traversing - seperating the selector into two .live(s calling the same functions works
10:15  Prometheus: $("select[id=subcategory'+currentline+']")
10:16  Prometheus: deisy: you can just do $("select#subcategory'+currentline+'")
10:16  deisy: let me try
10:16  Prometheus: # = id :)
10:17  JKarsrud: why put select in front of it at all?
10:17  dytrivedi: absolutely, when you have an id to descend from
10:17  JKarsrud: $('#subcategory'+currentline)
10:18  Prometheus: JKarsrud: true, it doesn't make much sense since it's an id.. :P
10:18  Prometheus: it's 3 am here, so I'm not feeling smart :)
10:19  deisy: because im loagin the data from ajax
10:19  deisy: and select value by doument id doesnt work
10:19  JKarsrud: imo it doesn't make much sense even if it's a class. Prefixing with an element is slower anyway
10:19  deisy: im going to upload the code one sec
10:20  JKarsrud: deisy: you'll need to select inside a function handled in the success callback of an ajax call
10:20  JKarsrud: If I understand you correctly
10:21  deisy: http://pastie.org/1469228
10:22  deisy: the subcategory select is laoded with ajax also so i need to select it this way
10:23  deisy: ok it's fixed $("select[id=subcategory"+current_row+"]").val();
10:23  deisy: that was the solution ^^
10:23  Prometheus: o_O
10:23  Prometheus: *shrug*
10:23  deisy: :P
10:23  markj: $('#subcategory'+current_row).val() surely
10:23  JKarsrud: why not $('#subcategory'+current_row=.val();
10:24  JKarsrud: s/=/)
10:25  deisy: because the subcategory id is selected from a select input thats loaded from ajax
10:26  markj: doesnt make any difference to how you select it once it's in the dom, just how you bind events to it before its in the dom
10:28  deisy: it's not bind because im not loading the data with jquery im doing in from an ajax request
10:29  deisy: but now its working it's fast
10:29  deisy: thanks for the help

11:02  JKarsrud: aha
11:02  unfo-: wanting to know if it could cause problems for us
11:03  JKarsrud: a button inside some element with type image shouldn't bubble events up the dom

11:25  JKarsrud: oodavid_: events in templates? ugh
11:25  oodavid_: JKarsrud - if the events are common to the template then it would make sense to have them there

14:24  JKarsrud: svenlito: well, you never do anything else than push a string of html to it, so
14:24  Nick_Meister: JKarsrud, well i am listening to mouse over, but im adding the event to many elements, and i need to move a div in between those, so i need to be able to tell to which and where it is going and coming from
14:24  JKarsrud: use jquery ui draggable? :)
14:24  Nick_Meister: How will that help?
14:24  Nick_Meister: its just a highlighter box
14:25  Nick_Meister: i hover over and element and it moves the box to it
14:25  JKarsrud: okay
14:26  JKarsrud: svenlito: now all those values are stored in an array. Then you need to append the data in that array to somewhere
14:26  svenlito: JKarsrud: how would i go about passing that string as an option to autocomplete?
14:27  JKarsrud: make searchResult available outside your ajax request
14:27  JKarsrud: becuase now searchResult isn't available outside the success callback
14:27  svenlito: JKarsrud: thats what ive realized yep
14:27  JKarsrud: instansiate it inside the click handler or something :)
14:28  svenlito: like?
14:29  JKarsrud: .click(function() { var searchResult = [] // autocomplete magic here });
14:30  JKarsrud: svenlito: if that made sense
14:30  svenlito: JKarsrud: yeah, move to to a different scope?
14:30  svenlito: right?
14:30  svenlito: into
14:30  JKarsrud: yeah
14:31  JKarsrud: move it to somewhere outside the autocomplete, seeing as you're using it in there
14:34  svenlito: JKarsrud: still not able to push data into that array. but at least the autocomplete is running now, seems it got blocked before cause the source wasn't available.
14:34  svenlito: thanks for pointing me in the right direction

14:46  Lee_msi: anyone here have a good working knowedlge of jq mobile... or are they all in the mobiledev chan
14:47  paul_uk: Lee_msi, well its not really about how to do it, as i know how to do it.  More really lets say I have 5 pages to load.  I load in the CSS, JQ, HTML for each of those websites.  How does this affect the performance of the browser?  If I go back to page 1 with it already being loaded in memory, how do I account for not loading its CSS, JQ again and only requesting the page.
14:47  paul_uk: *for each of those pages.  I mean to say
14:49  Lee_msi: all static content should be loaded via the main page, i.e. css files and jq. only jq which must fire when the page content loads needs to be ajax'd in with the external pages
14:49  Lee_msi: since the dom ready() wont fire on the ajax'd content
14:50  paul_uk: the way i want my site to operate, 90% of it is actually dynamic
14:50  Lee_msi: it all depends on how it works
14:50  Lee_msi: theres many ways you could do it
14:51  Lee_msi: if there your own content pages, use session vars to echo out the css and js include lines only if its a first viewing
14:51  wyled: why not just load jquery once? and call external scritps by creating <script> elements or by using eval'd code
14:51  Lee_msi: or as i said, put all static css files e.c.t. in the main page
14:52  tuxnani: how to close a dialog box on submit button click?
14:52  Lee_msi: $('#id').dialog('close');

14:53  paul_uk: wyled: i have well over 50 unique pages that could be requested.  each of those have their own combination of css and js files.  Sure when the page is requested it will get its own stuff loaded in, but when the user navigates to another portion of the site, i don't want a page refresh, rather the "container" portion of the site to be refreshed with incoming data, but this container will need jq/css/etc pertaining to the l
14:53  paul_uk: ink the user chose.
14:53  Lee_msi: well in that case just load them in and hope they have a good enough browser to not cache stuff
14:53  wyled: paul_uk, that's fine just make sure you load the script and link tags
14:53  Lee_msi: make sure its all minified e.c.t. and your fine
14:54  paul_uk: Lee_msi trust me, all optimisation techniques have been taken care of
14:54  Lee_msi: i meant "a good enough browser to cahce them and not redownload". im tired
14:54  paul_uk: the site is practically built and ready to go, but now i have put a chat function like gmail, i want it to operate like gmail does and not refresh the page on each request
14:55  wyled: use gears or storage
14:55  paul_uk: ok thanks for your answers guys...
14:55  tsyrak: what's the comment to feed jslint.com so it passes jquery code? (i'm talking my own code, not the jquery source code)
15:07  Ely2: finally solved it :D
15:08  Qci: i am doing this $("#elm").append("<div id='text'>some text</div>"); my problem is that after i do that i collect all the divs and i dont see the one with the id i insert, what should i do to notify the DOM that its there?
15:14  RoaDin: what is the command I need to change a <textarea> with an id of txb I've tried .val, and .text and both do not work... or maybe I'm placing them wrong.
15:15  Qci: roaDin?
15:15  RoaDin: yes Qci?
15:15  Qci: what you mean...
15:15  Qci: yore textarea have id="txb"
15:16  RoaDin: yes.
15:16  wyled: Qci, are you calling something via ajax? javascript is non-blocking code so you need to ensure that the DOM is ready before trying to access new elements
15:16  RoaDin: let me put it up on the jsfiddle....
15:16  Qci: wyled: the append is called in documet.ready(){}
15:17  wyled: RoaDin $(<elm>).attr('id', 'newId');
15:17  wyled: which version of jquery you using qci?
15:17  Qci: ummi hope its the latest let me check
15:18  wyled: is your code online somewhere?
15:18  wyled: so i can take a look
15:18  Qci: 1.3.2
15:19  Qci: wyled: the issue i am having is with contentFlow gallery,
15:19  Qci: let me see if a new version of JQUERY will solve it.
15:19  RoaDin: http://jsfiddle.net/pQhXz/1/
15:20  RoaDin: know that one wyled, what I am trying to do is change the text inside of it.
15:21  FinalAngel: is there a way to do this: $('canvas').css('max-height', 'auto');? 'auto' is obviously not supported by jquery...
15:21  wyled: http://jsfiddle.net/pQhXz/2/
15:21  wyled: you weren't using jquery...
15:22  RoaDin: oh doh...
15:22  RoaDin: hmm
15:22  RoaDin: odd...
15:23  RoaDin: ty wyled (need to double check my source code to make sure Jquery is loaded right then :/
15:23  wyled: =)
15:23  wyled: it happens
15:23  FinalAngel: kay it works when u leave the value empty, how convenient….
15:23  RoaDin: (back to work finally.)
15:24  RoaDin: oh double doh. had it pointed to the wrong dir.
15:30  irfaN|work: I see all jquery plugins like that; (function($){}(jQuery))
15:30  irfaN|work: what is means jQuery ? I didnt see the syntax
15:31  Qci: got it, the issue that i loaded the contentFlow.js before appending the new divs to my body
15:33  jomn: I'm having trouble adding a plugin to my code http://jsfiddle.net/yxhzU/82/
15:34  petersendidit: irfaN|work: $ === jQuery
15:34  petersendidit: $ is just a shortcut to jQuery
15:34  jomn: I'm using the HTML5 boilerplate which includes a plugins.js
15:35  irfaN|work: petersendidit, yes, but i want to learn what the syntax (function(){}(window))
15:35  irfaN|work: not just jquery
15:35  jomn: should i just copy+paste plugins into that file?

15:49  lorique: Hi. I have created a sliding box, which, when i slide it uses the animate function
15:49  lorique: my issue is. The text area is not shown until the animation is finished
15:50  lorique: can someone tell me why this is?
15:50  markj: ?demo @ lorique
15:50  bot-t: lorique, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
15:51  lorique: markj: can i private msg you to show you? id rather not throw it out there for all to see if not all can help
15:52  markj: keep it in the channel, helps others to learn
15:54  lorique: markj:  i cant do that. Its a site not yet released, and id rather not share our internal testing url's with everyone. i'll figure it out on my own. thanks anyway :)
15:55  markj: lorique if you paste only the specific html and js into a jsfiddle then you dont need to share the urls, if thats not an option then ok
15:55  lorique: markj:  yeah if in a couple of hours i cant figure it out, ill come back
15:56  mrh: So my friend is having issues with havinghis jQuery changing some HTML on his page.
15:56  mrh: his page is at stlaa.com/2011/index-final.php
15:57  mrh: the search box is making request to the db and the json request are fine, but i cant seem to get it to change the #results div =/
15:59  Ely2: is this possible var checked = attr('checked', 'checked');   --> jQuery("#dnn_ctr412_ProductList_dlProductDetail_ctl00_optionradio1_3").checked
15:59  Ely2: or does a var not work like this?
16:00  seutje: nah, then u'd need $.fn.checked = function() { return this.is(':checked'); } or something I guess
16:01  wyled: mrh, the json isn't fine. your server request is outputting some bad json
16:01  mrh: How did you deterimine that? The request that comes back looks fine more or less?
16:01  wyled: firebug?
16:02  wyled: it has some bogus text at the beginning
16:02  mrh: that is the value that was searched on
16:02  wyled: yea and it isn't valid json
16:02  wyled: you're doing a getJSON, and returning invalid JSON
16:02  wyled: which won't work

16:03  mrh: gotcha. hrm. well i'll have to look into that.
16:03  mrh: thanks.
16:03  mrh: oh you are right. test case example doesnt return that before
16:05 --- nbari|away is now known as nbari
16:05  wyled: also mrh, your getJSON request is a little odd
16:05  Ely2: seutje: is it possible to replace this in a var ?  jQuery("label[for='dnn_ctr412_ProductList_dlProductDetail_ctl00_rblModel_0']")
16:05  Ely2: but knowing there is also rblModel_1 and 2
16:06  mrh: How so wyled? Thanks for pointing that out. I reviewed some stuff and just fixed my error. I definitely was spitting out some PHP echo that was getting tagged into the problem.
16:07  Aamir: lorique: http://jsfiddle.net/8Q8qK/1/
16:07  wyled: it should be like this: $.getJSON('search.php', function(data){  showResults(data); runningRequest=false; });
16:07  seutje: Ely2: like with a for loop?
16:07  wyled: not sure what the second param for showResults is for, it isn't used
16:08  mrh: Yeah. I have been reworking some of his code =/
16:08  lorique: Aamir: yeah the thing i created is a little more complex, but i figured it out. It was box inside a box thing, where the inside box was too narrow
16:08  Ely2: euh yes
16:08  Ely2: like using the smae var but possible to call 1 and 2 and 3
16:09  Ely2: i'm trying to make my scripts less complex and use vars because i call some elements to much
16:09  wyled: erm
16:09  wyled: nevermind
16:09  wyled: it's fine
16:09  Aamir: el_kevino:  .replace ?
16:09  mrh: okay cool. i was just about to look into it =)
16:09  Aamir: opps
16:09  wyled: got confused
16:09  Aamir: it was for wyled
16:09  wyled: what is for me?
16:10  Aamir: var str = "label[for='dnn_ctr412_ProductList_dlProductDetail_ctl00_rblModel_0']";       var one = jQuery(str);    var two = jQuery(str.replace('0', '1');  ?
16:10  Aamir: wyled: ^
16:11  wyled: what are you putting it in jQuery for?
16:11  Aamir: because your example is in that way
16:12  Aamir: var ?  jQuery("label[for='dnn_ctr412_ProductList_dlProductDetail_ctl00_rblModel_0']")

16:15  BillCriswell: Birliban: .siblings() perhaps.
16:15  Birliban: BillCriswell, doesn't work because they are no siblings ;-)
16:17  Trixer: anyone who might have a moment to take a look at an ajax problem thats causing a dialog box to crash dead
16:17  Trixer: please take a look at this
16:17  Trixer: http://pastie.org/1470028
16:17  Trixer: it describes the problem and everything
16:17  BillCriswell: $('select:not(#foo)') ?
16:18 --- Dantman is now known as SleepyDan
16:18  Birliban: BillCriswell, it's worth a try but the single elements have no id. they are added dynamically
16:19  BillCriswell: I'm assuming they have different names? You don't just need to use an id there.
16:20  Birliban: BillCriswell, what can i put in the not()? every jquery selector?
16:21  BillCriswell: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/ is for the selector, you can also use this which might be easier http://api.jquery.com/not/ or even http://api.jquery.com/filter/

16:28 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
16:29  seutje: Ely2: it would prolly be more interesting to know what you're trying to do opposed to how you're trying to do it
16:30  Trixer: Igot an ajax call thats like causing my dialogs to die
16:30  Trixer: http://pastie.org/1470028
16:30  Trixer: details the problem and shows the code involved
16:30  seutje: coz var foo = "someString_"; for (var i = 0;i<3;i++) { $('label[for' + foo + i + ']'); } works, but seems silly
16:31  JAAulde: I have a block of code which can submit any of a few forms via ajaxSubmit() ( http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ ). Since upgrading to 1.4.4, some of the forms are being serialized such that [Object object] is the value being submited for many of the inputs.
16:31  JAAulde: The plugin says it is for jQ >= 1.3.2 which leads me to believe the plugin has not been updated at all for jQ 1.4.4
16:32  JAAulde: since jQ changed some parameterization stuff in 1.4, does anyone know of a viable replacement for the old form plugin?
16:33  seutje: Trixer: have u tried to remove the alert()?
16:33  seutje: it's evil, halts execution and causes more issues than it "solves"
16:33  seutje: use console.log or something instead
16:34  JAAulde: crap, the test suite for form plugin is using jQ 1.4.2 and all tests are passing
16:34  JAAulde: wonder what is wrong with my setup
16:35  Ely2: seutje was that long line to me ? other whise I could give you an example of what i'm tring to acomplish
16:35  seutje: Ely2: the var foo = "someString_" shit? yea
16:35  Trixer: seutje: I did
16:35  Ely2: ok
16:36  Trixer: the alerts were simply there to test to make sure teh functions were firing and to see where my code was "stoping" but its not.. it just erm by passes the dialog methods like they are not even there lol!
16:36  Ely2: seutje http://jsfiddle.net/heKru/ and I have some more of them
16:37  Trixer: for instance the cancel button works fine as long as its before teh ok button (which should close the diag but does not, so it kills the cancel button too lol
16:39  Trixer: I have checked to see if my dom is being modified after the append command it is, however the diag should still be there.. according to all my debugging everything is functioning fine.. just the diag gets killed I am wondering if I stumbled across a nasty bug
16:43  Aamir: Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/heKru/1/
16:44  Ely2: ok and is that faster than what I normally use ?
16:45  Aamir: Ely2:  its the same. You are providing a string to the jQuery ( str )
16:45  Aamir: .replace does not make it slower
16:45  Ely2: ok just more convinient :)
16:46  seutje: Ely2, Aamir: went for a diff approach: http://jsfiddle.net/heKru/2/
16:46  Ely2: can I just pick :D
16:46  Ely2: or is one better ?
16:47  Aamir: seutje:  if 0,1,2 are numbers incremented by 1

16:47  seutje: that's the case, isn't it? :)
16:48  queso: What's the best way, using the input box that it is tied to, to determine that the autocomplete widget is open?
16:48  seutje: I'd say mine's easier to extend, but Aamir's is more flexible
16:49  seutje: queso: it fires events afaik
16:49  Aamir: not sure where this 0, 1   are id generated by the server so which can be any number
16:49  Aamir: ids*
16:49  seutje: yea, I'd just going on the assumptions given to me
16:49  queso: seutje: so set a variable?
16:49  Ely2: it's given by the server
16:49  seutje: ?autocomplete events
16:49  bot-t: seutje, Plugins/AutoComplete/Events/"activate.autocomplete" - jQuery ... - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/AutoComplete/Events/"activate.autocomplete"
16:50  Ely2: but it's actually the numbers I gave
16:50  seutje: nice :/
16:50  Ely2: won't chance
16:50  queso: seutje: there are open and close events
16:50  seutje: queso: exactly
16:50  seutje: or do u want to check if it is open at an arbitrary point in time?
16:50 --- rchern-afk is now known as rchern
16:51  seutje: queso: don't think there's a getter method for the open state, so u might have to set ur own during the open event
16:53  JAAulde: for anyone who read my question and wondered, I noticed the test suite for form plugin is running v2.43 as opposed to the latest which is 2.52. The suite is also using jQ 1.4.2
16:54  JAAulde: I downgraded my copy of the plugin to 2.43 since all the suite tests were passing and things seem better
16:54  queso: seutje: okay, thanks for your help
16:56  EvanCarroll: hrm
16:56  EvanCarroll: that was confusing
16:57  EvanCarroll: aparently, there is a chan #jquery-ui that isn't the official chan for jQueryUI filled with idlers
16:57  Altreus: I'm having weird symptoms and I can't track it down. Things that are being set visible during execution are becoming invisible again when execution finishes
16:57  Altreus: EvanCarroll: hello stranger
16:57  EvanCarroll: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/html5-and-jquery-ui-datepicker-date-formatting-defaults
16:57  EvanCarroll: I just wanted to get more attention and comments on that proposal.
16:58  EvanCarroll: it seems to me as if diverging from HTML5 conventions is bad, and should be stopped before the bad defaults stand too long
16:59  Altreus: Frankly i don't think it goes far enough and US date format should be eradicated with prejudice
17:02  EvanCarroll: feel free to expand upon the suggestion
17:02  EvanCarroll: I agree with US date format, I think most everyone does (except jqueryui)
17:03  EvanCarroll: it's a horrible format, and it isn't even easier to read.
17:05  Trixer: I was afk gents did anyone happen to respond to my question?

17:08 --- Yoast is now known as Yoast92
17:08  Yoast92: Guys, I'm new to jQuery and I'm running into something I can't explain
17:09  Trixer: well whats the problem?
17:09  Yoast92: my complete-function isn't triggering after fadeout has done its job
17:09  Yoast92: should I pastebin?
17:09  Yoast92: http://pastebin.com/Tx0eimX6
17:10  Yoast92: span.pageno is a span with a digit in it, div.gallerythumb is obviously a div with a border and an image inside it
17:11  Yoast92: even when I just run those last three lines by themselves, the divs fade out all right but the alert doesnt show
17:12  Trixer: yoast is this jquery ui?
17:12  Yoast92: ui?
17:12  Yoast92: nope I'm just using jquery 1.4.2
17:13  Yoast92: $("div.gallerythumb").fadeOut(900, "linear", function() { alert('Hi') }); <-- according to what I read about it, this should be able to work..
17:13  Trixer: Yoast, seperate the callback function
17:13  Trixer: one sec
17:14  Yoast92: like so?
17:14  Yoast92: 		function complete() { alert('Hi') };
17:14  Yoast92: 		$("div.gallerythumb").fadeOut(900, "linear", complete);
17:14  Yoast92: doesn't work either :(
17:15  Trixer: http://pastebin.com/qxBfBVE0
17:16  Yoast92: nothing :/
17:17  Trixer: hmm I think jquery ui is having some serious bugs here in the newer versions
17:17  Trixer: im thinking of reverting back
17:18  Yoast92: I'm not using the UI though, I got an 'old' 1.4.2
17:18  Trixer: wait your not using the UI?
17:18  swiggy: what is the best and most efficent jquery menu option?
17:18  Yoast92: I dont think I am
17:18  swiggy: i have a css dropdown menu right now
17:18  tbranyen: swiggy: css > jquery
17:18  swiggy: but im sure there is a nice jquery one
17:18  Yoast92: Like I said, I just started using jQuery
17:19  swiggy: cmon, there has got to be a fancy jquery one
17:19  tbranyen: swiggy: if i needed a drop down menu i'd most def explore the css options first
17:19  Trixer: if thats teh case
17:19  Trixer: check this out
17:19  Trixer: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
17:19  tbranyen: swiggy: why do you want jquery?
17:19  tbranyen: to do something that css can already do
17:19  swiggy: "i" dont
17:19  swiggy: this website owner does tho
17:19  Trixer: any ajax pros out there, wanna take a look at this http://pastie.org/1470028
17:19  tbranyen: same thing to me
17:19  Trixer: the ajax call is killing my dialogs for some reason
17:19  tbranyen: you should try and consult better and tell them its not the best option
17:19  Yoast92: What's the difference between jQuery and jQueryUI then? :o
17:19  swiggy: whoa
17:19  swiggy: weird seeing a paste w/ black background
17:20  swiggy: data : ( params != undefined ? params : false ),
17:20  Trixer: lol thats pastie :P
17:20  swiggy: i didnt know u could write if's like that
17:20  swiggy: in js
17:20  Trixer: Yoast Jquiery UI is specifically made to cover what your trying to do :P
17:20  swiggy: i thought u need to group them with ()
17:20  Yoast92: ah oke, great
17:20  Trixer: Swiggy, yeah you can please excuse the sloppy code its being conbstantly redone
17:21  Yoast92: but still, shouldnt that function just be called
17:21  Yoast92: I mean the third parameter of fadeOut seems to be a function that gets called when it's done.. :x
17:21  Yoast92: but I'll have a look at jQueryUI
17:21  swiggy: jqueryUI
17:21  swiggy: makes jquery
17:21  swiggy: jquery
17:21  Trixer: it really does
17:21  Trixer: jquery UI shouldnt even be seperate from jquery really
17:21  swiggy: nope they need to be packaged together
17:21  Trixer: jquery ui is to what jquery is to JS
17:22  swiggy: i do not know anyone who uses jquery without UI
17:22  Yoast92: k..
17:22  wyled: you serious? i don't use UI in most of my projects
17:22  wyled: and it is a HUGE file
17:22  Yoast92: but still, that doesn't resolve my innitial problem
17:22  Trixer: Then your really really selling your self short
17:22  Yoast92: I don't get why the function isnt called
17:22  Trixer: Yoast, try the jquery UI function for fade out they migh thave done swomething to the jquery one sense UI is out
17:22  wyled: how am i selling myself short?
17:23  Trixer: because jquery UI if you plkan on doing any visuals is the way to go :P
17:23  swiggy: yoast - link?
17:23  Trixer: which is kind of the reason that js exists
17:23  Trixer: is for your display layer...
17:23  wyled: that's not true at all trixer
17:23  swiggy: so have we decided that there is no jquery menu option that is worth using in conjunction with CSS?
17:23  Trixer: Swiggy there are lots
17:23  Trixer: what kind of menu are you looking at?
17:23  wyled: i use jquery for the simplicity of ajax calls and the ease of creating plugins
17:24  swiggy: horizontal, about 5 parent menus
17:24  swiggy: and some submenus
17:24  Yoast92: swiggy can I pm you the link? :o
17:24  swiggy: my CSS skills are not that fancy, i am a developer not a designer
17:24  swiggy: sure
17:24  swiggy: why cant u post it in the channel tho? 0_o

17:30  burzum: how can i use the jquery validation plugin to apply a rule to all input elements with a certain class? it seems like i can only specify the name of the field for a rule but not a class?
17:30  swiggy: are   ;'s compulsory in javascript/jquery?
17:31  tbranyen: they are if you want to minify your code
17:31  tbranyen: and not have it blow up in your face
17:31  swiggy: lol
17:31  swiggy: right
17:31  swiggy: thjats what i thought
17:32  Yoast92: yeah if you want to have multiple commands on one line, they're nessesary

17:35  JeffJassky: Hey, guys. Had a question. I have a multi-select list of options. alt+click works to select multiple items. However I'd like to get the REGULAR click to act like alt+click. What might be the best way to go about this?
17:36  JeffJassky: I'm not sure if I can invoke a modifier key with JS.. or if I'll just have to detect the click event and handle the selection manually..
17:37 * Trixer blows jquery up
17:37  Yoast92: ok so after removing 'linear' it now triggers the alert, but it triggers continously for some reason.. $("div.gallerythumb").fadeOut(900, function() { alert('Hi'); } );
17:37  Ely2:     jQuery('input#dnn_ctr386_ProductSearch_txtSearch').watermark('watermark', 'Bv: house, openlucht, nieuwjaar');
17:37  Ely2: can I tell when clicking on a link to remove the use of watermark on that id ?
17:38  Aquaguy: Anyone has used the validator plugin?
17:38  eTiger13: Ely2: only if watermark has some sort of unregister or remove function
17:38  bot-t: (136 hours ago) <Corey> tell etiger13 I am Corey Quinn, yes.
17:38  burzum: Aquaguy, im just trying to use it, maybe i can help you?
17:38  Aquaguy: $("#researchProjectForm").validate({ ignore: ".date" }); that ignore is ignoring me hahaah
17:39  Ely2: ow yes eTiger13 $.fn.removeWatermark = function()
17:39  Ely2: just saw it
17:39  Aquaguy: I dont want class="date" elements to be validated
17:39  Trixer: Yoast it might be a good idea to do a check to see if your div is visible yet or not
17:39  Trixer: or because i think its going to call it until the fadeout continues
17:39  Trixer: erm finishes rather
17:39  burzum: Aquaguy ive seen the plugin has an ignore() method
17:40  Yoast92: it fades to invisible first though, and then calls nonstop
17:40  Yoast92: but yeah I'll check
17:40  Yoast92: oh wait
17:40  Yoast92: I get it
17:40  rgoytacaz: is there a way to get the element height within the document? in other words where is this element position in relation to the document?
17:40  Yoast92: there's 9 divs with the same class
17:40  Yoast92: it's alerting for every single one of them!
17:40  J_A_X: anyone know a way to update the view with new data without having to recreate it?
17:40  burzum: Aquaguy, well, at least i think i saw it
17:40  VictorCL: is there a function that willl put all the <li> in an array so I can then hide all of them excep the last two ?

17:43  Aquaguy: burzum there is no ignore method. there is a ignore property, an object, and the validator plugin checks the ignore element to see if it has elements to ignore
17:43  Aquaguy: but it is not working for me
17:43  JeffJassky: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/879809347 This is not acting as expected. Anyone have any thoughts?
17:44  burzum: Aquaguy, i cant help you then sorry, just messing with it too :/
17:44  Aquaguy: $("#researchProjectForm").validate({	ignore: ".date"	 }); Doesn't ignore it

18:03  eTiger13: Ely2: are you specifically setting those somewhere? like in css or javascript? if not then they are not set
18:04  Ely2: in an xsl they are seth i think
18:04  eTiger13: Trixer:  ok then yes i am familiar with it. i dont see how thats relevant for anything though
18:04  eTiger13: Ely2: not the same
18:04  Trixer: well, I wanted to see a response to the .live() method before I asked my question

18:12  wyled: not anything advanced
18:12  Mnkras-Laptop: Trixer: i did that yesterday with my livesearch
18:12  Kambfhase: jaql: there is neither .live nor delegate in 1.3.2 so you'd have to do that manually. Btw use the child selector!
18:12  jaql: wyled: seems like you didn't use it too much
18:12  wyled: i did
18:12  jaql: Kambfhase: eh?
18:12  Kambfhase: ie "ul > li" instead of "ul li"

18:14  Trixer: however move it out of the call back function and it works great
18:14  Kambfhase: jaql: ok, then your selector is crap.

18:16  eTiger13: jaql: also, your id's should be unique across the page, not just individual sections.
18:16  Trixer: and then I found other CMS system snad like them better
18:16  wyled: naturally, because drupal is so cumbersom
18:16  Trixer: then I found codeignitor and married it with jquery and lived happly ever after
18:16  Mnkras-Laptop: heh
18:16  Trixer: well imho I think the majority of CMS systems are rather cumbersom..... it takes a long time to get productive past a CEO aspect

18:51  eTiger13: thepacmanfan: unless example1 is a var string, then its wrong
18:51  timmywil: thepacmanfan: it's fine, but you have '' inside ''
18:51  Aamir: thepacmanfan:    jQuery('a[rel="example1" ]').colorbox();
18:53  kojiro: That w3 page on js_cookies needs to be on w3fools just for the "A Password Cookie" example
18:53  thepacmanfan: '' inside '' is bad? i corrected to Aamir's suggestion
18:53  thepacmanfan: eTiger13: it's not a var string, as far as i know... what's wrong with it?
18:54  Aamir: if example1 is a var than          jQuery('a[rel="'+example1+'"]').colorbox();
18:54  eTiger13: thepacmanfan: your first single quote opens a string and then the second single quote closes it so example1 is ignored and a js error is thrown
18:54  timmywil: thepacmanfan, if example1 was a string you would still need jQuery('a[rel='+example1+']')
18:55  thepacmanfan: so should it be jQuery("a[rel='example1']").colorbox();    perhaps?
18:55  timmywil: ?g -w3schools javascript string escape quote @ thepacmanfan
18:55  bot-t: thepacmanfan, JavaScript - Strings - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/strings.html
18:55  timmywil: yes that would work too
18:56  timmywil: but the quotes around example1 are unnecessary anyway

18:59  timmywil: there's a firebug for f4
18:59  EvanCarroll: you need firebug if you're using FF
18:59  thepacmanfan: timmywil: oh, ok, i'll look for it

19:15  CallToPower: Kambfhase: always use alert ;) http://enterprise-js.com/17
19:15  Kambfhase: you need a console.
19:15  thepacmanfan: ...i'm using firebug :o
19:15  Kambfhase: yeah, firebug is a console :)
19:15  thepacmanfan: i have Show JS Errors and Show JS Warnings enabled.
19:16  delinquentme: when i store  a var:   var $someVar = $(this);   ... and i want to have it spit back at me with:   alert($someVar)    .. is there a way i can do that without getting  [object Object]  ??
19:16  Kambfhase: delinquentme: console.log
19:16  timmywil: thepacmanfan: console.log(jQuery('a[rel="example1"]')[0]) …if it says undefined you're rel isn't right
19:17  thepacmanfan: timmywil: run that from the console?
19:17  timmywil: sure
19:18  thepacmanfan: timmywil: that seems to do nothing...
19:18  thepacmanfan: the search box turns red...
19:18  timmywil: refresh the page with the console open
19:18  Ownatik: just like me currently at work

19:18  timmywil: what search box?
19:19  thepacmanfan: ahhhh, got it!

19:19  thepacmanfan: heh

19:20  delinquentme: Kambfhase, im not following ?
19:20  Kambfhase: delinquentme: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
19:20  thepacmanfan: ok, running that in the console returned <a rel="example1" href="/sites/all/themes/eac/images/gallery/ashlar3a.jpg">
19:20  Kambfhase: read this. It'll help!
19:20  thepacmanfan: which is the first, but not only, link i have rel=example1 set on
19:20  rgoytacaz: I'm trying to get some function to detect if the element is in the browser viewport, which I think I did, but in pure javascript(read as having problems cross browser). I would like to know where can I check the equivalent of some javascript property/function in jquery.
19:21  thepacmanfan: and when i run this from the console: jQuery('a[rel="example1"]').colorbox();
19:21  delinquentme: Kambfhase, <3
19:21  thepacmanfan: it returns [a.cboxElement /sites/a...ar3a.jpg, a.cboxElement /sites/a...ar4a.jpg]
19:22  timmywil: well that sounds right
19:22  thepacmanfan: that's both of the <a> tags with rel=example1 set
19:22  thepacmanfan: but it doesn't load colorbox
19:22  timmywil: sounds like it does, what happens when you click those links
19:23  thepacmanfan: it loads just the image.
19:23  rgoytacaz: This is the function to check if the element is in the viewport http://pastie.org/1470709, i need to translate this to use jquery, so its cross browser compatible.
19:23  Kambfhase: thepacmanfan: what does jQuery().colorbox return when you type it into the console?
19:23  thepacmanfan: function()
19:24  Kambfhase: colorbox is loaded and initialised than. hmmm
19:24  thepacmanfan: colorbox loads fine if i do this: http://pastebin.com/tdBTaYDv
19:25  thepacmanfan: but colorbox doesn't seem to support grouping based on classes, only rel values...
19:25  thepacmanfan: that's why i'm trying to get this way to work.
19:26  thepacmanfan: i'm just using the colorbox example code... heh

19:45  timmywil: nafri: jQuery might have trouble animating background position.  I know you could do backgroundPostitionY, but that won't work in all browsers.  You could adapt animate to fit your needs most likely, but jQuery doesn't know how to add 1 to "0px 0px"
19:45  joshsmith: Mixmasterxp: yes. use .ajax()

19:57  magnus_: for a programmer coming from C/C++, what exactly are the different parts of a jquery call? like $('myelement').myfunc() .. I guess $ is an instanciated object of JQuery class, and 'myelement' is what .. ? it's not like you "call" a function of $ (or is it some kind of constructor parameter?). the myfunc() is just a function call to the object returned by $('..')?
19:57  t2gs: serio =/
19:58  tolborg: :first will only select 1 element, and :first-child will select the first child only (and not the first child with my given class)

19:59  timmywil: magnus_: "myelement" is a parameter for the jQuery constructor.
19:59  esparkman: new to jQuery so i am sure i am overlooking something simple
20:00  LayneObserdia: magnus_: you will call the function for all elements, matching "myelement".
20:01  timmywil: esparkman, return false;
20:01  ajpiano: magnus_: $ == jQuery.  typeof jQuery == "function".  jQuery.fn === jQuery.prototype.  jQuery("foo") == instantiate a new jquery object, passing that selector as a function and inherit all methods from the jQuery prototype.
20:01  esparkman: timmywil: ??
20:02  timmywil: your click handler needs to return false
20:02  timmywil: you're reloading the page
20:02  esparkman: timmywil: would that go just under the $(".content).hide(); or before it?

20:15  ajpiano: LakWork: eep
20:15  Kambfhase: jaql: pong
20:15  jaql: Kambfhase: remember the problem i was having not too long ago?
20:15  Kambfhase: no
20:16  jaql: Kambfhase: with http://jsfiddle.net/jgsTP/8/
20:16  ajpiano: LakWork: i would try serio's approach
20:16  Kambfhase: kk
20:16  LakWork: what would be the most appropriate event? there's the open and success events which come to mind, but open would only fire when there are results, and success would only fire when the min character value is met
20:17  jaql: Kambfhase: i don't know what it is, but when i implement that on my site each click causes the data change to become slower and slower
20:17  LakWork: i'm thinking success might be viable
20:18  serio: ajpiano, also, that vid of the ppl dancing on the staten ile ferry brightened my day
20:19  jaql: Kambfhase: it works though, but becomes increasingly slow
20:19  Kambfhase: weird
20:20  iaj: hi there
20:20  jaql: the ajax solution you helped me work out a bit ago is faster than this :|
20:20  iaj: what would the selector look like to select all divs with id starting with #foo?
20:20  jaql: i was doing this in hopes of it being significantly faster lol
20:24  Snerf: I am using an <input type='checkbox' id='test' and trying to toggle the button using $('#test').attr('checked',true) , but the button is not changing. I also did $('#test).button() to kame it a UI button, any ideas?

20:25  Kambfhase: iaj: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
20:25  peol: Snerf: use .attr('checked', 'checked') and .removeAttr('checked'), don't use booleans
20:27  eberg: @wyled, what do you mean by "that's how you represent an array in a post request?"  First off, it's a GET.  Second, I've never encountered this before...the unrequested appending of '[]' to the name of a CGI param.  Obviously not a standard approach.  But the question is why is jquery doing it and how do you turn it off?
20:27  Snerf: peol, no difference
20:29  Snerf: peol, just tried removing .button() to make it a normal button, and then it shows properly as checked and unchecked, it seems the issue is when its a UI button

21:46  necromancer: the directory is basically links to other people's hosting right?
21:46  ajpiano: necromancer, it is in the works
21:47  necromancer: ajpiano: where do i get involved? :)
21:48  necromancer: there's a jquery-rails gem that has generators for installing the jQuery framework, and i was looking into making generators that screenscrape the plugins directory and download the plugin selected
21:49  necromancer: right now, the generators have to assume that "DOWNLOAD" actually points to a .js file
21:49  necromancer: which in most cases is not true lol
21:49  tbranyen: necromancer: i wouldn't work too hard on this, once the new plugins site is out it will be a fairly strict process to have something added
21:50  necromancer: that's cool
21:51  necromancer: i mean, i enjoy browsing the repo but one of the best parts of the Ruby world is the fact that I can install plugins in the command line
21:51  tbranyen: Yeah but that doesn't make sense in a javascript world
21:51  tbranyen: ruby is hosted on your machine in a centralized path specific location that can be shared by many apps
21:51  tbranyen: thats not the case with plugins

22:10  khmer: i am completely lost here
22:11  Hoe``: Is there a js error causing the script to stop executing prior to your .delegate?
22:11  Hoe``: ff is good at silently ignoring errors, chrome is better at telling you

22:13  convidado: clarkfischer: I found the error! The target content contains a div with the same ID of my caller file!
22:13  khmer: Hoe``: nah, that wasn't it. i figured it out; an earlier script had bound returnFalse to $('a') :)
22:13  khmer: Hoe``: so that was stopping propagation
22:13  khmer: Hoe``: thanks though
22:14  Hoe``: ahh lol that happens all the time in the project i'm working on. I assume you know the proper way to do it?
22:14  khmer: switched to e.preventDefault() :)
22:14  Hoe``: xotix: not sure what you mean
22:15  khmer: i'm...assuming that's a good way to do it
22:15  khmer: it seems to be working for me

22:20 --- Users 794 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 793 normal]
22:20  Hoe``: xotix: here's the simplest way to do that
22:20  Hoe``: each div which contains a form give a specific class, lets say my-form-page
22:20  dragger: Hello, i have a problem with jquery TinyMce plugin while i defined path to script "/path/to/tiny_mce/jquery.tinymce.js the tinymce try to get related scripts files from another path when i routes to http://localhost/script/pages/view its try to get it from previous path althought my script in http://localhost/script/js/...........
22:21  Hoe``: have your 'next' button do: var currentForm = $(".my-form-page:visible"); currentForm.hide(); currentForm.nextAll(".my-form-page:first").show();
22:21  xotix: yeah hide and show it but how can i say with css where it should be?
22:21  Hoe``: when one hides, the next should take it's place, no?
22:21 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 94 seconds
22:21  xotix: thats why i wanted to includ it into a div :P im new ^^
22:21  Hoe``: put each form section inside of it's own div
22:21  xotix: hmm mhm probably
22:21  Hoe``: btw, only use one <form> tag
22:21  xotix: why?
22:21  Hoe``: in your css do: .my-form-page { display: none; }
22:22  Hoe``: because that's not how forms work
22:22  Hoe``: inside your js do: $(".my-form-page:first").show()
22:22  xotix: wait i make me an example ^^ thanks
22:22  Hoe``: and do your layout like: <form><div class="my-form-page"><input /></div><div class="my-form-page"><input /></div></form>
22:23  Hoe``: see what i'ma saying?
22:24  xotix: why do you have and input there?
22:24  Hoe``: lol that's what they're entering on each page :)
22:24  Hoe``: it was just a place holder for what you really want in your form
22:24  b_52light: anyone using javascriptmvc ?
22:29  xotix: var currentForm = $(".my-form-page:visible"); currentForm.hide(); currentForm.nextAll(".my-form-page:first").show();, first everything gets visible? o.O then hidden, then the first one show? ?
22:32  Hoe``: xotix: that goes into your 'next' button's click event
22:32  xotix: hoe, what exactly does that line do?
22:32  xotix: yeah, but explain it pls :)
22:32  Hoe``: if finds the current visible one, makes it hidden, then finds the next one after it, and makes it visible
22:33  Hoe``: because each section of your form will be wrapped in a <div class="my-form-page">
22:33  Hoe``: that gets the :first of the items that are next to it
22:33  Hoe``: not from the start
22:34  Hoe``: $(".my-form-page:visible").hide().nextAll(".my-form-page:first").show(); you could even do it like that if you wanted to
22:37  Hoe``: so you want your js to look like this:
22:38  Hoe``: $(function() { $(".my-form-page:first").show(); $(".my-next-button").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(".my-form-page:visible").hide().nextAll(".my-form-page:first").show(); }); });
22:39  LakWork: how can i 'addRange' to a javascript array?
22:39  etcetera: is there any specific reason why jqery mobile would get stuck taking a action link from a list element and doing the ajax request
22:39  etcetera: I just get a ..."loading" screen.
22:39  Kambfhase: LakWork: what do you expect addRange to do?
22:39  LakWork: add multiple items to an array
22:41  Hoe``: no addRange, but there is concat
22:41  LakWork: okay that works. thanks
22:41  Hoe``: var joinedArrays = arrayA.concat(array2)
22:41  LakWork: groovy
22:41  etcetera: anyone
22:41  etcetera: ?
22:42  LayneObserdia: or use the array.push() https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
22:42  etcetera: looking at the source, the href looks just fine.
22:42  LayneObserdia: that will not create a new array
22:42  etcetera: if i just append the hostname with that href it resolves fines.
22:42  etcetera: but jquery mobile has issues resolving that route.
22:42  Hoe``: wouldn't push push the array as a single object, not flatten it?
22:43  Hoe``: so you do arrayA = [1, 2, 3, 4]; arrayB = [5, 6, 7, 8]; arrayA.push(arrayB) and get [[5, 6, 7, 8], 1, 2, 3, 4]
22:43  etcetera: uncaught exception: Error: k.data(
22:43  LayneObserdia: hoe``:  :/ that could be
22:43  Hoe``: does k not have .data?
22:43  Kambfhase: ?var a=["a"]; a.push("b","c")
22:43  bot-t: Kambfhase, jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/api/
22:44  etcetera: oh, nvm. forgot to add the required scripts :-P
22:44  Kambfhase: ?eval var a=["a"]; a.push("b","c")
22:44  bot-t: Kambfhase: 3
22:44  Kambfhase: ?eval var a=["a"]; a.push("b","c"); a
22:44  bot-t: Kambfhase: ["a", "b", "c"]
22:44  Hoe``: ?eval var a=["a"]; a.push(["b","c"]); a
22:44  bot-t: Hoe``: ["a", ["b", "c"]]
22:48  Hoe``: xotix: how you doing over there?
22:49  xotix: sry was on the phone. will quike try it and post it
22:53  khmer: look what i learned today! http://jsfiddle.net/uZcTK/
22:54  LayneObserdia: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6zfs/ looks lie you can push an array on array
22:54  xotix: i get unknow pseudoclass visible.
22:54  LayneObserdia: like*
22:55  jakehow: anyone seen an issue where closest() returns an array of 2 objects?
22:56  khmer: LayneObserdia: that's not doing what you might think, though
22:56  Hoe``: jakehow: i haven't, but you maybe able to workaround it using .parents("...:first")
22:56  Hoe``: xotix: are you using the latest jQuery?
22:56  khmer: LayneObserdia: you end up with ['a','b',['c','d']]
22:56  khmer: LayneObserdia: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6zfs/1/
22:57  xotix: its not because that i think i know why.
22:57  jedimind_: but you dont know why
22:58  jedimind_: and that is the fundemental problem
22:58  LayneObserdia: khmer: youre right. tried it in the console. is there any better "debugging" function then console.log() that will write the debugoutput on the page? something like print_r for php?
22:58  khmer: LayneObserdia: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6zfs/1/
22:58  khmer: LayneObserdia: excuse me, http://jsfiddle.net/Q6zfs/2/
22:58  jedimind_: so there.

22:59  khmer: LayneObserdia: you should have a console visible, and then you can use the whole console API
23:00  LayneObserdia: khmer: that's the way I do. but I hoped there is a function for it on this page. I'm really new to this way.
23:01 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22

23:04  jedinix: i'm having some odd ass error with jquery.validate plugin, it's causing my input fields to disappear on validation
23:05  xotix: hoe, thats okay? http://pastebin.com/x8ruGQFK now i can show all my input stuff where ihave tstep1 step2 and i can save the user input directly as value. in ff that works, ff does liek cache it. then get everything save it and resete it. that should be fine, right?
23:07  jedinix: hey i'm having some odd issue with jquery.validate plugin, it's making my inputs disappear on validation
23:07  jedinix: any ideas?
23:08  delinquentme: if(  $spanText != "No file selected" ) {}     this SHOULD evaluate right??
23:14  semaphore: $spantext? that does't look like jquery
23:15  clarkfischer: any variable can be prefixed with $
23:16  clarkfischer: delinquentme: Yeah, it should evaluate. typeof($spanText) === 'string', right?
23:16  delinquentme: clarkfischer, yeaps!
23:18  Xenc: I like to prefix selector variables with $
23:18  seismicmike: is there a viable alternative to the jquery ui datepicker? I'm trying to get a date picker in an adobe air ap and for the life of me cannot get the ui date picker to work. a) it won't respond to click events, which I've read seems to be due to AIR's security restrictions and hasn't been gotten around yet and b) it refuses to theme. When I run it with no theme roller css it shows up but transparent and aweful, but when I use a ui theme it doesn't. s
23:18  seismicmike: how. up. at. all..... odd... anyone know an alternative, or should I build my own?
23:18  Xenc: $main_div =  $('#main_div');
23:19  clarkfischer: Looks like he did something more along the lines of $spanText = $('#span').text()
23:19  clarkfischer: Which is sort of odd, since $spanText isn't/wasn't ever a jQuery object.
23:19  Xenc: each to their ow
23:19  Xenc: n
23:19  snover: seismicmike: I submitted a patch for it like…last year
23:20  snover: seismicmike: UI guys just don’t care about AIR
23:20  snover: apparently
23:20  snover: The theming should work though…
23:20  snover: seismicmike: if you search in the ui bug tracker you will find my patch.
23:20  snover: neglected.
23:22  seismicmike: i found a bug mentioning the problem with a patch, but a) wasn't sure what to do with the patch file b) when I tried to add the changes manually, like was suggested in the post, couldn't find the line of code that was mentioned as the place I should enter the code.

23:34  xotix: http://pastebin.com/zHs0kFPx why does :first get me always the next? can someone explain me that a bit more? first, i set the first one visible. then i get it. then i hide it and show the next one, which is :first. but why? how does it exactly work?
23:35  ScottO_: next one is first, because you hid the original first?
23:37  xotix: and?
23:38  xotix: if i press the button on the 2nd lien of the func everything is hidden. so then i should get an error, if it depens on the visibility.
23:38  xotix: if it doesnt matter, the first div is stil the first. why does get the 2nd one first if the current first gets hidden?
