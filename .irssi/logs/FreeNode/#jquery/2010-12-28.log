00:00  bengro: losing: hm, I dont think so. because $('a.showOriginal').click()... works. so the click event is fine i think.
00:00  losing: ah, kk
00:01  mokush: hey, I'm loading this xml with $.ajax, but it always takes me to the error handler. How can I "return true" from the xml?
00:03  l4rk: return true;
00:04  mokush: I ment like sending an http code of some sort, so that $.ajax know it was successful

00:09  carbonhat: I'm stumped. I'm using a function to highlight a div when I click on it....for some reason, both the div I want -and- all of its parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. are being highlighted. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/JXk5Q/
00:10  Bartzy: Anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/vqBJu/1/
00:10  Bartzy: Any idea why when clicking on this green title, the text slides down and shows more, but then 2/3 way down it stucks for a moment and then continues ?

00:11  Gate: Bartzy: I've had similar animation jumpiness in the past, it has always been realted to margin for me
00:12  Bartzy: Gate: Margin in elements inside the element I animate ?
00:13  Gate: Yes, and on the element that is being animated
00:14 --- versatiletech_ is now known as versatiletech
00:14  Gate: I had slide downs with a "pop" like that because the margins were only being applied at the end
00:14 @snover: woooo margin collapsing!
00:15  Bartzy: Gate: So how do I solve it ?
00:15  Bartzy: yay snover
00:15  Bartzy: die stupid weird feature!
00:15  carbonhat: Bartzy - http://css-tricks.com/forums/discussion/1459/jq%3A-slidetoggle-animation-skips-jumps/p1
00:16  carbonhat: in that post, someone claims -any- element with both a set width and slideToggle will jump like that
00:16 @snover: carbonhat: that post is $ancient years old
00:16  carbonhat: ::shrug:: I don't care how old it is - I'm just tryin' to help.
00:17  carbonhat: putting my google-fu to use
00:17  Gate: Bartzy: I am playing with your example to see if I see a solution
00:17  Bartzy: carbonhat: Thanks for the link. I tried adding position relative as the link suggested but it didn't help
00:18  Bartzy: also the element I slideToggle is a simple <div>, no width...
00:18  Bartzy: snover: Any idea (you said something about margin collapsing) ?
00:18 @snover: Bartzy: no, there’s some bug in height calculation that I haven’t managed to look into
00:19  kippi: hello
00:19  kippi: can I ask for help with slickgrid here?
00:19  Gate: Bartzy: this is a different issue, sorry for the misleading comment. Looks like your problem is more related to the table to me
00:19  Bartzy: snover: So just live with it ?
00:20  Bartzy: snover: BTW, the bug that carbonhat linked to is EXACTLY my issue. but it won't solve my issue :\
00:20 @snover: kippi: you can ask; doesn’t guarantee help
00:20  carbonhat: Bartzy, not that it's a great solution, but when I changed the animation speed from 'slow' to 'fast' the skip almost becomes unoticable
00:21  Bartzy: yeah but I want it slow
00:21  kippi: I have slickgrid working, but for me to be able to see the changes in the table I have to scroll down and then back up to see the change, see code: http://pastebin.com/jqFvSD6E
00:21  Bartzy: snover: If you say that it's some kind of weird behavior bug, I'll just leave it like that
00:21  Bartzy: Gate: Thanks for your help.
00:22  Gate: Bartzy: putting a constant height on the div fixes it
00:22  Bartzy: Gate: But how can I know the height.. the text isn't always the same
00:22  Gate: http://jsfiddle.net/vqBJu/11/
00:22  Gate: Bartzy: yeah, I realize not directly helpful, but you can measure it before you do the .hide()

00:26  Bartzy: snover: Well they didn't provide any resolution there...
00:26  Bartzy: Gate: Nice idea calculating the height
00:26  Bartzy: cool
00:27  carbonhat: I'm stumped. I'm using a function to highlight a div when I click on it....for some reason, both the div I want -and- all of its parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. are being highlighted. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/JXk5Q/

00:28  Bartzy: this is valid right ?
00:28 --- gigamonk` is now known as gigamonkey`
00:28  ajpiano: carbonhat, uh, cause the events are bubbling to those things and the selectors you have chosen are nested?
00:28  santi: Hello! I'm very new to jquery but I want to use autocomplete for my cookbook. There are two problems for me: When I let search.php search for database entries I receive value|md5 and in the input I see value but I want that the md5 hash is inserted into an hidden input. The other problem is, I want more than one field doing the same, can I define classes? http://jsfiddle.net/bdXWV/
00:28 --- gigamonkey` is now known as gigamonkey
00:29  ajpiano: santi yes, you can use any jquery selector
00:29  Bartzy: Gate: How can I calculate the div height, if It's hidden ?
00:29  ajpiano: santi, you ar using  a very old autocomplete plugin
00:29  serio_: why is it that the jQuery UI slider doesn't send rounded percentages to the obj?
00:29  ajpiano: i suggest you use the one in jquery ui
00:29  carbonhat: ajpiano , can you explain what you mean by bubbling?
00:29  Bartzy: There's a way to calculate element's height if it wasn't hidden ?
00:29  serio_: working with numbers like left: 13.083333333333332%;  is annoying
00:29  santi: ajpiano: I will change it, I used the code from the demo example
00:29  ajpiano: santi, you're looking at the wrong demos
00:30  ajpiano: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete
00:30  santi: ajpiano: Damn, I will change everything, try again and if it won't work I ask again. Thanks
00:30  carbonhat: ajpiano - also I know the selectors are nested, but would expect it to only register the click on the 'top' layer, or innermost div
00:30  ajpiano: carbonhat, events "bubble"
00:30  ajpiano: that is, they propogate from one element up the dom to its parent
00:31  ajpiano: that is the fundamenatl basis for live
00:31  bot-t: See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events for a list of events that bubble
00:32  Gate: Bartzy: Its visible until you do the .hide when the page loads
00:32  Bartzy: Gate: Right.
00:32  Gate: So before you do that, measure its height
00:33  Gate: The height will remain the same unless you are dynamically changing the content of the same div
00:33  carbonhat: ajpiano, i just added 'return false;' at the tail end of my function and it fixed the issue. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
00:33  ajpiano: ok
00:36  Bartzy: Gate: But how can I get the height to the click function ?
00:37  Bartzy: maybe store it in $.data of the element ?
00:38  danheberden: Bartzy: i'm not following along with your needs, but $.data or using variable scope to save those kind of variables is typical
00:38  Bartzy: ok. thanks
00:40  Bartzy: $('#element').data(...)
00:40  Bartzy: can I somehow reference the jquery collection inside 'data', or I must use each ?
00:41  Bartzy: I want to store the element's height with .data
00:42  savid: Is it possible to get an element's current padding?  I tried .css('padding'), but it returns an empty string.  It seems to only return something when it's set w/ javascript.
00:42 --- snover is now known as snover|away
00:42  danheberden: savid: you can't get shorthand css
00:42  savid: danheberden,  ahh, that makes sense :)
00:43  Bartzy: savid: Calculate outerHeight(false) - height(), minus the border too
00:44  Bartzy: danheberden: Any idea about my question with .data() above ?
00:44  maestrojed: I need to make graphs on the fly from a sets of data. I need to save these graphs as an img. I will probably need to do things like logarithm graphs, etc. I am reviewing jqPlot. Any other suggestions?
00:45  danheberden: Bartzy: if i understand right, you _can_ save a jq collection using data
00:45  Bartzy: danheberden, that's not what I meant
00:45  Bartzy: I want to do something like $('#element').data('height', $(this).height())
00:45  danheberden: aye - that's how ya do it
00:45  Bartzy: this is really the context there ?
00:46  danheberden: well, depends
00:46  Bartzy: I just want to set the element's height in its .data()
00:46  danheberden: on where you're using 'this' ;)
00:46  danheberden: oooh
00:46  Gate: Bartzy: I doesn't need to be there. Simply measure the height, and set it using .css({ height: $(selector).height()}) or something along those lines
00:46  danheberden: yeah, in that case var $element = $('#element'); $element.data('height', $element.height() );
00:46  danheberden: would be a better approach
00:46  Gate: you don't need to persist the value beyond the first time you set it
00:47  danheberden: I think Gate is getting into the 'you might be setting a bandaid this say' approach, Bartzy
00:47  Bartzy: Gate: OK... so just $('.my_divs').height($('.my_divs').height()).hide() ?
00:47  danheberden: s/say/way
00:47  danheberden: whoa
00:47  danheberden: um
00:47  danheberden: no
00:48  danheberden: it wont just work on a collection like that
00:48  Gate: danheberden: hes dodging a bug, so yes, I consider it a bandaid
00:48  danheberden: (keep in mind, i have no idea what you're trying to actually accomplish)
00:48  Bartzy: I just need to set the element's calculated height before hiding it.. but there can be more than one element
00:48  Bartzy: danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/vqBJu/1/
00:49  Gate: danheberden: also correct, it wouldn't work on a collection, but you could throw it into an _.each fairly easily with minimal alteration
00:49  Bartzy: Click on the green title... see the animation get stuck 2/3 way through ?
00:49  Gate: s/\_/$/
00:49  danheberden: Gate - ya, i'm just thinking he might as well save the var in scope
00:49  Bartzy: danheberden: This is solved (as Gate proved :)) when setting a height to the div I'm animating...
00:49  Gate: danheberden: coding style, I find additional bookkeeping undesireable if you can do a fire-and-forget solution
00:50  danheberden: Gate - ya, depends on implementation for sure
00:50  danheberden: in the context of a single operation, it makes sense to keep it there
00:50  danheberden: if it's over the spectrum of an application however
00:50  danheberden: ya, save it fo lata
00:50  Bartzy: $this.height($this.height());
00:50  Bartzy: This is valid ? :|
00:50  Gate: I also like to avoid unneccecary calls like doing .css({}) on every click, but that is just a pet peeve
00:51  danheberden: Bartzy: assuming $this is a jq collection, sure
00:51  maav: $(this).height()?
00:51  Bartzy: it is. thanks.
00:51  danheberden: maav: assuming $this = $(this);
00:52  danheberden: which is common practice
00:52  danheberden: as a caching technique
00:52  Gate: Bartzy: if there is only one element selected
00:52  Bartzy: danheberden: But only if $this is a jquery collection that consists of 1 element right ?
00:52  Bartzy: yeah
00:52  Bartzy: thanks
00:52  Bartzy: I'm trying
00:52  Gate: Bartzy: $this.height() will return the height of the first item IIRC
00:52  danheberden: Bartzy: yeah, in those cases if it's more, you'll have to use each
00:53  danheberden: oh, wait
00:53  danheberden: ?height
00:53  bot-t: .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
00:53  danheberden: Bartzy: it'll take a function
00:53  santi: ajpiano: Does the new autocomplete only accept json or could I use my "key|value" scheme too?
00:53  danheberden: .height( function(i,h) { $(this).height( whateverVarItIs); } );
00:54  ajpiano: santi, i recall being able to make it use the old scheme
00:54  danheberden: look at the second method signature on the help page
00:54  Bartzy: danheberden: so even if I have multiple elements in the jquery collection, I can use the function ?
00:54  danheberden: Bartzy: it will give you 'this' for every element
00:54  danheberden: so i think you can make it work
00:54  santi: ajpiano: So I have to use json? :(
00:54  ajpiano: no
00:54  ajpiano: 1 sec
00:54  Bartzy: thanks cool
00:55  Bartzy: Gate: It solved the problem. Thanks so much :p
00:55  danheberden: santi: you mean the source? it can be an array or name/value pairs (see the example)
00:55  ajpiano: santi, yeah what danheberden said
00:55  danheberden: json is just the way to deliver said data type
00:55  ajpiano: you just manually roll the ajax request, call split on it
00:55  ajpiano: and pas the data long
00:55  Bartzy: danheberden: Chained commands are happening one after the other ?
00:56  danheberden: Bartzy: yes, the result of the return
00:56  danheberden: each function returns 'this'
00:56  Bartzy: $elements.height(function...{}).hide() - hide will happen only after the function happened for each element in $elements ?
00:56  Bartzy: oh
00:56  Bartzy: so that probably won't work ?
00:56  danheberden: hide will happen after the height
00:57  danheberden: the call backs aren't events, so they'll be called within the context of your height(..)  call
00:57  Bartzy: lol that works somehow...
00:57  Bartzy: I don't know how height returns the entire $elements collection
00:58  Bartzy: and how this function is happening only once ? There are 4 elements in $my_elements
00:58  danheberden: Bartzy: in the case of providing it a function, that function gets called for each element
00:58  danheberden: then hide is called for each element
00:58  danheberden: it's a built in 'each' call, basically
00:58  Bartzy: oh
00:59  Bartzy: cool
00:59  Bartzy: very handy
00:59  Bartzy: so easy, it makes everything for you
00:59  danheberden: when you get time, google on writing a jquery plugin
00:59  danheberden: it might make more sense seeing one

01:06  maav: danheberden can you send me a something to read about this $(this) and $this? I always use $(this)
01:07  Gate: maav: var $this = $(this); is a way of making the jquery call only once
01:07  Gate: "caching" it so that you don't repeat work that is already being done
01:07  maav: but $this is ONLY a template var?
01:07  maav: temporary
01:08  maav: not template :P
01:08  danheberden: maav - ya, like instead of using $(this) all over
01:08  danheberden: and recreating the jq object (in the context of your callback)
01:08  danheberden: just do var $this = $(this)
01:08  danheberden: that way, when you use $this a few times, you're caching the collection
01:08  danheberden: and not recreating it every bloody time
01:09  danheberden: you can name it wahever you want, just $this has become popular
01:09  danheberden: consider it the parez hilton of jquery
01:09  maav: i thoutht that $this is some more special than temporary var
01:09  danheberden: nup
01:09  ajpiano: maav, $ is a legal character in js with no special meaning
01:09  maav: ok
01:09  maav: i got it
01:10  ajpiano: it is put at the beginning of jquery objects by convention only
01:10  danheberden: if you're going to cache it to persist in more that just that callback
01:10  maav: ok ok :)
01:10  danheberden: i'd name it something meaningful, like $myAwesomeTHingy
01:10  danheberden: $thoseFuckingListItems
01:10  Gate: maav: that also provides a way of accessing the top "this" inside loops and things that might have "this" bound to something else

01:46 @snover: application/json, not text/json.

01:48  alpha^: Is there a way to .bind() a handler to an element in such a way that the new handler is appended to any handlers that may already be bound to said element?
01:49  ajpiano: that is how it works

01:50  santi: I changed the header to application/json, and it delivers now JSON, so where is the problem in this script? I'm running against a wall
01:50  santi: Does the "new" autocomplete use the ?q= param too?

02:50  lengrrr: haha.. does ppl still use IE6?!
02:51  lengrrr: I thought everybody was using FF, RM, Chrome, opera or safari :P i thought IE died for like months ago.. damn..
02:53  maav: statistics are not that optymistic :(
02:55  lengrrr: Well.. Is it just to write like border-radius: 15px; in my css file to get it work, right?
02:56  Cork[home]: lengrrr: depends what browsers you want to support
02:56  maav: hmmm...and where -webkit-, -moz- ? ;)
02:56  Cork[home]: older versions of chrome/safari/firefox needs the prefixes ^
02:56  lengrrr: Well, im using rockmelt, firefox, safari and opera..
02:57  lengrrr: right now im using rockmelt..
02:57  lengrrr: -moz-border-radius ?

02:58  Akin: Could someone take a look at my sidebar static/fixed div code?  I want to make it a little more elegant and dynamic.   http://pastebin.com/Lu2NqDUk
02:58  Akin: right now, i'm manually inputting a number for the distance from the top of the browser (115px) - is there a way to get jquery to dynamically figure that out?
02:59  Akin: i was suggested - var myOffset = $('divselector').offset(); - but am not sure how to implement it.  Still very new to this.
03:02  ajpiano: Akin, then the offset from the top is myOffset.top
03:03  Akin: so how do i replace the '115' with that?  sorry, super basic knowledge

03:07  dstanek: i'm using $.get and $.appendTo to dynamically add content to my pages and on every browser except IE it works fine
03:07  dstanek: in IE when I have an embed script block it is not executed
03:08  dstanek: any ideas before i start doing crazy stuff?
03:09  maav: it's flash in content?
03:09  Jezek: if i use getScript should i be able to modify that page's html?
03:09  maav: Jezek: yes
03:10  Jezek: i just get $("body") is null
03:11  Jezek: i did $("body").html(...);
03:11  dstanek: i wonder if i can just exec($('script').val()) or something to that effect
03:11  Akin: ajpiano, i've tried using the myOffset.top variable as the value, but for somereason it breaks the effect now.
03:12  Akin: the div jumps back and forth every pixel i scroll down
03:14  maav: dstanek if you get script with getScript, it's executed like script loaded from <script src=...> if you put in this file alert("test"), you should get alert after $.getScript()

03:16  santi: ajpiano: Now, everything works fine but my second problem is still there :( I have no clue how to use this technique with more than one field with an hidden field. How can I give the next input an value without knowing it's name or anything else?
03:16  JDThatGuy: Anyone willing to lend me a hand with something? :)
03:16  dstanek: maav: i'm using get because i get a check of HTML and a script block to initialize it - currently i'm just adding it to the DOM

03:16  JDThatGuy: Oh yeah?
03:16  cm9: Hi there. I have searched for this, but can't find it, so .. is there a built in jquery feature or plugin that allows dragging from a stack of finite items, where the items of that stack are positioned right on top of each other? imagine a stack of 10 coins on top of each other and you can keep picking them up from the same place, until there are no more. Any ideas anyone?
03:16  dstanek: maav: does that mean that I'd have to resort to 2 hits for IE?
03:17  ajpiano: $(this).next().val() @ santi
03:17  JDThatGuy: Thanks Jezek I'll try there
03:17  Jezek: yeah if it's jquery question stay here, if not.. i'd try the javascript channel
03:18  santi: ajpiano: You're a genius, thanks :)
03:18  dstanek: maav: it looks like i can check the jQuery.support.scriptEval to find out if i'm in IE and do the extra work

05:52  ocf: var fbMod = $('fb_row').length % 3 to determine how many feeds are on the bottom row
05:52  ocf: if 1, i can just use :last or last()
05:52  danheberden: ocf, is setting classes on those in your markup out of the question?
05:52  ocf: if 2, I can use .prev('fb_row').andSelf() (haven't tested, but I'm fairly sure this should work)
05:52  ocf: dan - not necessarily, I thought of that
05:52  ocf: but those are generated dynamically and a sexy html string is thus created

06:03  danheberden: if you pass an array natively, like data: { wtf: ['foo', 'bar'] }

06:28  Figaroo: how do I get the css top value as a number, not the $element.offset().top, which is the offset from the top edge of the viewport (page), but rather the offset from the parent container with the property of either position:absolute, or position:relative?
06:31  Figaroo: To elaborate: $element.offset().top will return 100 if an element is 100px from the top of the window viewport. But if that same element is in a containing element with the CSS property of position:relative and has an top offset of 10px, then the inner element would only need the CSS property top:90px to have an offsetTop of 100px.
06:32  Figaroo: So I want to get the CSS top property as a number, without the "px" appended at the end.
06:32  Figaroo: should I just use .css() or is there another more perferred way to get this value?

10:38  K1ng: anyone got noah?
10:43  imakewebthings: _nix00 have you tried removing the ' around .no-sub
10:44  Cork[home]: _nix00: $(this).find("ul:visible > li > a:not('.no-sub')");
10:45  imakewebthings: ^^ yea find, not .children
10:45  Cork[home]: _nix00: children only check direct decendent, so you need find

10:46  _nix00: it works! :D

10:48  Cork[home]: i don't think the speed difference should be to big
10:48  Cork[home]: if any at all
10:49  _nix00: it feels same.
10:50  rmccue: I'm running $('#something').outerHeight(), however it is not including the border in the value. Any ideas why?
10:54  rmccue: Aha, I have border-top, but no border. Could that be why?
10:55  imakewebthings: rmccue: can you show us?
10:55  rmccue: imakewebthings: Locally, so not really.
10:56  imakewebthings: rmccue: what is your border-top rule
10:56  rmccue: imakewebthings: `border-top: 1px solid #aaa;`
10:57  imakewebthings: rmccue and you can verify that .innerHeight and .outerHeight give the same number?
10:59  m_e: how would i watch for an event "click my second tab" on the tabs ui? http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-show maybe with this?
10:59  rmccue: imakewebthings: .innerHeight, .outerHeight and .height all return 32
10:59  m_e: but i see no specific "click tab2" there
10:59  _30equals: hey all, i have a menu, and each link triggers an ajax call - i was wondering what the best way was to stop the previous ajax call when you click on another link..?
10:59  imakewebthings: rmccue: what element is it?
10:59  rmccue: imakewebthings: A div
11:00  rmccue: imakewebthings: Absolutely positioned, and height is specified in the CSS.
11:00  rmccue: Tried removing the absolute positioning, didn't change anything.
11:02  imakewebthings: rmccue: like this http://www.jsfiddle.net/S52UG/
11:03  imakewebthings: correct?
11:05  rmccue: imakewebthings: http://jsfiddle.net/S52UG/1/ but that gives 33, so it's different to what I'm getting.

11:06  imakewebthings: rmccue: so we just have to figure out what's different between the fiddle and your code.
11:07  rmccue: imakewebthings: Indeed, I'll try changing the HTML to match better.
11:12  rmccue: imakewebthings: http://www.jsfiddle.net/S52UG/2/ is the markup I have, and still can't reproduce. :/
11:14  jomofcw: Hello =)
11:14  rmccue: Interestingly, if I remove the explict height, jQuery tells me all 3 heights are 0.
11:15  imakewebthings: rmccue: that would be the absolute positioning i imagine
11:16  rmccue: imakewebthings: If I remove the positioning and the explicit height, it still tells me they're all 0
11:17  imakewebthings: rmccue: is your element hidden when the code is run?
11:17  rmccue: imakewebthings: No, but it's not inserted into the DOM.
11:17  imakewebthings: where is you code being executed by the way, after load, domready ?
11:17  imakewebthings: rmccue ..... yea that would be why
11:18  imakewebthings: i imagine...
11:18  rmccue: Hrm, indeed, if I check after it has been inserted into the DOM, it's right.
11:18  rmccue: Damn it.

12:35  yannick_: Cork[home]: hm...
12:35  yannick_: done
12:35  Cork[home]: well you can do $('[id^="uc-catalog-buy-it-now-form-"]') but thats slow
12:35  Cork[home]: class is simpler and faster
12:42  g0rd0n: hello!
12:43  g0rd0n: i have a problem using ckeditor inside a jquery ui dialog. perhaps this is somehow related to the dialog. the problem is, i cannot interact with the overlay screens of ckeditor, for example with the link editor... i cannot type in the URL field, nor make any selections with the drop-downs
12:43  g0rd0n: any ideas where the problem could be? i tested ff/ie/chrome all with same results
12:44  g0rd0n: probably the problem is that the modal form locks out that overlay, but i dunno how ti fix that

13:08  dr0id: that sucks juha__ :(
13:08  juha__: hoh why?
13:08  dr0id: I don't want to do that hard work that's why needed endless pagination (also for learning experience though)
13:09  juha__: well, if you think of it, how are you going to get the next part of content?
13:09  dr0id: query the DB with a LIMIT
13:09  dr0id: LIMIT 100, 100
13:09  dr0id: then LIMIT 200, 100
13:10  juha__: yeah, that's it
13:10  jessica-m: is there a way to apply labels to a slider?
13:10  juha__: dr0id: there you have a working pagination for infinite scroll
13:11  Nikro: stygyan: thnx)
13:12  dr0id: juha__: heh, I want something like, as soon as the first 100 records are seen, there would be an ajax request loading the html for the next 100 records and just appending
13:12  dr0id: or basically, an ajax request to another page
13:12  dr0id: that would just echo the html for the next 100 records
13:14  dr0id: juha__: or tell me, how can I know that the user has read 100 records? after that I will write the rest of the code myself (and not use a plugin)
13:15  sean`: pagination
13:15  jessica-m: anyone know?
13:15  dr0id: o_O
13:15  sean`: jessica-m, you can manually do it
13:15  dr0id: sean`: don't need pagination, infinite scroll :P
13:15  jessica-m: manually do it how
13:15  sean`: dr0id, same logic
13:15  sean`: You need to provide a pointer
13:15  sean`: eg, last output'd id
13:16  dr0id: sean`: see, I scroll down and down, and as soon as the 100th record is in view I load the next 100
13:16  jessica-m: i just want to print the corresponding values against the slider bar
13:16  juha__: dr0id: well, i'm not sure how the infinite scroll works, but i'm sure it sgives you some sort of page number
13:16  sean`: dr0id, seriously trying to tell me what an infinite scroll is?
13:16  juha__: that you can use to calculate the offset
13:16  juha__: that's how i've done similar thing on our site
13:16  sean`: infinite scroll == pagination
13:16  dr0id: sean`: heh, no, but I want to know, how can I know that the 100th record was read, that's it, I will write the rest of the code myself
13:16  sean`: I've told you the answer
13:20  jessica-m: sean`: how would i do it manually? jquery ui doesnt have a way to do it?
13:20  sean`: jessica-m, isn't your last answer already answered?
13:20  jessica-m: huh?
13:21  sean`: you're asking me two questions
13:21  sean`: didn't i just asnwer your last one?
13:21  sean`: as for your first one, provide more info on what you're trying to do
13:21  jessica-m: you said do it manually
13:21  dr0id: maybe I didn't get it sean`, but there should be some javascript function that could know that the 100th record was read and then call a function that would .load ?
13:21  jessica-m: well there is this page: http://weblogs.asp.net/jaredroberts/archive/2010/01/12/add-label-to-jquery-slider-handle.aspx
13:21  jessica-m: i dont want to put the label on the handle
13:21  sean`: dr0id, you want me to explain to you how pagination works?
13:22  jessica-m: but along the edge of the slider bar, A B C .. and so forth
13:22  jessica-m: but in my case, i only have 4 values
13:22  dr0id: not really , but not sure what you are trying to say (because I haven't done it before)
13:22  jessica-m: so in accordance with the steps
13:22  sean`: dr0id, I'm telling you, you need to build a pagination system
13:22  sean`: and instead of replacing the content, append it
13:23  sean`: that's what infinite scroll is
13:23  sean`: it fetches ?p=2 and appends it
13:23  dr0id: right, but with pagination you click a link for the second page, in infinite scroll you don't, so how does the infinite scrol clicks/loads the content of the second page? on what basis? how does it know that "hey! lets load the second page content now" :P
13:24  sean`: the position of your scrollbar
13:24  sean`: dr0id, http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
13:24  JKarsrud: dr0id: If you implement pagination on the server, you just need to load that page with JS on the client, and append it when the scrollbar is at the bottom of the page
13:25  JKarsrud: Easy as pie, even
13:25  dr0id: cool, thanks
13:33  Nikro: how can I trigger the default hover event? =\ mouseover mouseenter focusin dont work

13:38  JKarsrud: Nah, not really sure, didn't hover() without any params work?
13:39  sean`: dr0id, you can't trigger hoverf
13:39  sean`: you can only trigger mouseenter/leave/in/out
13:39  dr0id: ok
13:39  sean`: .hover isn't an event, it's a shorthand
13:40  dr0id: true

15:05  DragoneneWork: anybody in here got experience with jquery and touch devices (iphone primarily)?
15:05  timing: yeah moi
15:05  timing: but just ask your question
15:05  DragoneneWork: I was about to :P
15:05  DragoneneWork: hadn't had time to write it yet :>
15:05  DragoneneWork: trying to figure out if there's a good way to speed up interaction with the site -
15:06  DragoneneWork: eh, how to explain this
15:06  DragoneneWork: it's not necessarily jquery related really
15:06  DragoneneWork: not sure how to make an interface feel "responsive"
15:06  DragoneneWork: having a clickable link which runs a javascript takes a while because it takes the iphone a while before it responds to your click
15:07  DragoneneWork: I'd like it to react faster, possibly even on "fingerdown", something like onmousedown
15:07  DragoneneWork: if that makes any sense
15:07  Techdeck: hey guys, whats the best way to transform a full date to something like: Dec 28, 2010
15:08  DragoneneWork: I was going to suggest looking at the javascript date object and just constructing the string yourself
15:08  DragoneneWork: but might not be the most convenient way
15:08  Michael: All our ipod work is in objective c so far
15:08  Michael: because of the response time
15:09  DragoneneWork: :/
15:09  DragoneneWork: this isn't for something that's necessarily super performance-critical
15:09  Marz: hi, i have links that open up in a lightbox via jquery, but if the user clicks the link before the DOM is ready, the link will be followed to another page... to prevent this an idea is to hide the elements, and the show when the dom is ready... but this solution doesn't degrade gracefully...
15:09  DragoneneWork: but it'd still be nice to be able to get it to react faster on the iphone side
15:09  Michael: DragoneneWork, As a rule of thumb you can try to keep new content load to 1 second or under
15:09  Michael: Anything 2 or over is bad user experience
15:09  drasz: $("#box1") is null
15:09  DragoneneWork: see, once it runs the script it's fast enough
15:10  DragoneneWork: ah, there's no new content at all
15:10  Michael: Well that's good
15:10  DragoneneWork: it runs a javascript which sends a request to the server
15:10  DragoneneWork: nothing else
15:10  DragoneneWork: it's just a button really
15:10  Michael: And I don't know about onmousedown because they might be long pressing it
15:10  DragoneneWork: if I hold down the link and then release with the option "open link" it's fast enough
15:10  DragoneneWork: it's just that *before* even doing that it takes a while to react to the touchdown on the iphone side of it
15:10  Michael: There's not much you can do about that
15:11  DragoneneWork: :/
15:11  Michael: That's the iphone processing slowly
15:11  Michael: Droid does the same thing
15:11  Michael: The good news is that people already expect that
15:11  DragoneneWork: it sure doesn't feel like the iphone processing slowly?
15:11  DragoneneWork: I mean, if you hold down the link and then choose the option to open it, it's fast
15:11  Michael: Just like I expect to have a degraded experience on most sites if I use MSIE
15:11  DragoneneWork: I guess it *could* do processing in the background
15:11  Michael: (brb)
15:11  DragoneneWork: but I expect it doesn't
15:12  DragoneneWork: hm...
15:14  jomofcw: Damned thing, I can't display only an element of the ajax loaded content in a colorbox :/

15:15  timing: DragoneneWork: try touchstart event
15:15  jomofcw: Just test case, so nothing really to JSFiddle, I just don't find any method to do it :/. Colorbox provide a onComplete callback, but without any parameter :/.
15:16  timing: DragoneneWork: I don't think mousedown is triggered at an iphone, but touchstart is
15:16  DragoneneWork: timing: cool, I'll try it.
15:16  DragoneneWork: is there a html attribute for that, or do I bind it with jquery?
15:17  timing: I think ontouchstart can be used, but using .bind('touchstart') is better :-)
15:17  DragoneneWork: timing: that worked much better
15:17  DragoneneWork: cheers! :)
15:18  timing: np!
15:18  DragoneneWork: (just using ontouchstart for now, could change it later if needed)
15:18  DragoneneWork: I suppose it might also work differently on different phones
15:18  DragoneneWork: so might have to detect platform and change which function is bound depending on that
15:21  timing: touchstart works on my android too
15:21  timing: it's widely supported by any modern webkit browser
15:21  timing: *mobile webkit browser
15:21  jomofcw: Android FTW !... sorry, off topic :x
15:22  timing: DragoneneWork: I just noted that mousedown works too
15:22  timing: no clue which event fires first
15:22  timing: I expect mousedown to fire later
15:22  timing: but that's just a guess

15:24  DragoneneWork: timemachine3030: mousedown didn't work for me
15:24  DragoneneWork: but I suppose I'll put all of them there
15:24  DragoneneWork: and just return false after
15:24  DragoneneWork: hopefully that'll make it fire only one

15:35  DragoneneWork: somebody recreated mousedown/mouseup behaviour using ontouchX events
15:35  DragoneneWork: and created a test page for it
15:35  DragoneneWork: seems to work pretty nicely
15:35  DragoneneWork: could be useful for some things, I imagine
15:36  zn_: i'm looking for something like this: $(a href='test123').click()
15:36  adamhutton: rreyes: what do you expect to happen when $('#frm').submit() is run?
15:36  rreyes: adamhutton: I would expect #frm form to be submitted
15:36  rreyes: nothing else
15:37  zn_: $('a href["test123"]) ? I don't remember it :/
15:37  adamhutton: rreyes: can you call $('#frm').submit() from the firebug console?
15:37  rreyes: Yes... nothing happens
15:37  l4rk: zn_: helps to read the docs $("a[href='test123']").trigger("click");
15:37  adamhutton: right--it's not the onchange event that's failing is all I'm noting here :)
15:38  rreyes: Yes
15:38  rreyes: I know
15:38  rreyes: I already tried with a simple alert and that worked
15:38  rreyes: :)
15:38  zn_: l4rk: thx
15:38  zn_: :)
15:39  rreyes: but I don't know why .submit() fails without reporting a single thing
15:39  DragoneneWork: I used .submit the other day in pretty much exactly that way
15:39  DragoneneWork: worked fine for me
15:39  DragoneneWork: :/
15:40  DragoneneWork: (I realize that's not what you wanted to hear...)
15:40  adamhutton: rreyes: I'm checking the comments on http://api.jquery.com/submit/
15:40  adamhutton: and I think http://api.jquery.com/submit/#comment-106178333 might be your issue
15:40  adamhutton: I see <input value="Submit" name="submit" class="boton" style="float: none;" type="submit"> in your source :)
15:41  rreyes: yes
15:41  rreyes: that seems to be the issue
15:41  DragoneneWork: that souonds right
15:41  rreyes: let me see
15:42  DragoneneWork: why would the submit button need to be named in any case?
15:42  DragoneneWork: ...unless you change the value of the button with stuff you do in the form
15:42  DragoneneWork: and want to retrieve that on the server side
15:42  adamhutton: rreyes: there's also http://api.jquery.com/submit/#comment-55040528 -- but I can confirm the form does not submit in Chrome 8 on Mac, so idk if that's related
15:42  DragoneneWork: which would be... strange :D
15:43  dr0id: whats wrong with var a = TRUE; ? :P
15:43  dr0id: ok, lowercase
15:43  rreyes:  adamhutton: that fixed it... thanx, adam

16:01  Miffdiver: yeah it was neat
16:01  Miffdiver: i like how it inserts the necessary form into the dom as well
16:01  Miffdiver: dependant on a <h1> <ul> structure though, as it sticks it in between those two
16:02  Miffdiver: but hey, thats good semantics
16:03  Miffdiver: skipping the animation helped too
16:04  Miffdiver: hm, maybe slideUp(0) is a bad idea, whats another jquery function that does the same but without the animation?
16:04  ablomen: Miffdiver, hide()?
16:05  Miffdiver: heh yeah
16:05  Miffdiver: sorry, i was a bit lazy there
16:06  Miffdiver: neat, went from only being able to handle 300 entries tops to 3700 entries
16:06  Miffdiver: with some lag though
16:07  EpiphanyG: would it be quicker to append a <style> tag to the document that does display:hidden to whatever elements they are?
16:07  erichynds: Miffdiver, rewrite the events to use delegate() instead
16:07 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o paul_irish]
16:08  EpiphanyG: I mean you could only append a style tag if it was easy to target them all with one selector
16:08  erichynds: so like form.delegate("input", "change", fn) instead of $(input).change(fn)
16:08  erichynds: and use filter() instead of :contains

16:13  muhdik: within the td
16:18  muhdik: does div gets an exception to the nowrap rule?
16:19  ajpiano: muhdik, you should set the nowrap on the td itself, not on a nested div
16:20  muhdik: i do my set up is <td>$<div>0.00</div><td>
16:20  muhdik: but my $ and 0.00 are on two seperate lines
16:20  muhdik: i mean </td>
16:20  Brodingo: thats because a div is a block element
16:20  adamhutton: muhdik: div is a block-level element and will always go to a new line unless you set display:inline on it. or use a span?
16:20  timmywil: isn't the nowrap attr deprecated now?
16:21  Brodingo: yeah you should use a span for text
16:21  muhdik: ok
16:21  EpiphanyG: what's the best way to toggle the jQuery ui sortable()? use items: "li:not(.ui-state-disabled)" and then toggle the class?
16:21  timmywil: white-space: nowrap
16:21  adamhutton: jessica-m: http://jsbin.com/ixulu works for me :(
16:21  ajpiano: muhdik, it would make a lot more sense to put a span instead of a div
16:21  adamhutton: jessica-m: http://jsbin.com/ixulu/edit has relevant code
16:21  ajpiano: EpiphanyG: you'd have to call sortable("refresh") after toggling the class afaict
16:21  serio: muhdik, that no-wrap thing doesn't work if you have other floated elements inside your div
16:22  muhdik: ok display inline wokred
16:22  EpiphanyG: ah ok, thanks ajpiano :)
16:22  muhdik: but i want to make my $ sign be left and my 0.00 on right within my td do i have to put $ in div too?
16:22  serio: ?
16:22  muhdik: and do align left
16:23  muhdik: i have <td>$<div align="right">10.00</div></td>
16:23  muhdik: i want $     10.00 with all my collumns aligned the $ on left and numbers on right
16:23  Brodingo: once set to display inline an elements width will not expand to fit its parent
16:24  muhdik: cause i am doing subtotal , tax and total
16:26  adamhutton: muhdik: it almost seems like you want the $ to be decorative. like <td style="background-image:url(dollarsign.png);background-position:0 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat">10.00</td> :)
16:26  adamhutton: oh, and text-align:right on the td :)

16:28  timmywil: muhdik, can you use external css instead of the align attribute on a div?  I wouldn't think you would need to do any aligns, but it's hard to know for sure without seeing code.
