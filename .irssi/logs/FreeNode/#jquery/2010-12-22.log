10:09  ajpiano: $("foo").bind("click.namespace",fn)
10:09  cojack: ajpiano: I mean, that I bind event submit on form
10:09  cherrypie_: I am a little out of it, I must be a insomoniac because I don't sleep its like 4:30 here
10:09  cojack: but when I call submit without jquery just pure js, this event it's not fire
10:10  cherrypie_: I didn't sleep at all yesterday either I am going on a bender
10:10  ajpiano: cherrypie_, OTOH, there's sort of a reasonable limit to how much one can talk to oneself about consumer electronics before we all start to wonder wtf
10:10  ajpiano: ;)
10:10  Vorspire: sean` ping
10:10  ajpiano: cojack, jquery handlers are not attached directly to elements
10:10  ajpiano: they are stored in jQuey.cache
10:10 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 93 seconds
10:10  ajpiano: when you trigger native dom events, you won't get the jquery bound handlers
10:11  cherrypie_: some people were talking back to me, i wasn't talking to myself the whole time...lol
10:11  cojack: ajpiano: so, there is any way to get it works coretly?
10:12  ajpiano: $("form").trigger("submit') ?
10:12  cojack: let me check
10:12  schweizer: how can i add a new node in jstree?
10:13  cherrypie_: I have a habit of making things too long, especi2.2ally when I am slap happy from not sleeping.   I should of been like guys what do you think about those android tablets that running 2.2 out there?  Out of the 15 something do you think any one of them might cut the mustard for someone who just play games, and might read a book or two?
10:13 --- akw__ is now known as akw_
10:13  cherrypie_: I am trying to get a present for my mom :-)
10:14  cherrypie_: if my mom end up an android fan I will shit my pants
10:16  vladikoff: cherrypie_, ask #android, they know
10:16  ajpiano: cherrypie_, i understand your...instinct and desire to discuss stuff like this online, but do you not have a slightly more appropriate venue for this sort of stuff...?
10:17  cherrypie_: allright bro my bad..I will back off..
10:17  ajpiano: :)
10:17  cojack: ajpiano: I don't think so it will works...
10:17  ajpiano: a little OT never hurt nobody but there's kind of a happy medium is all
10:17  ajpiano: cojack, what are you actually trying to do
10:18  cherrypie_: Thanks to mekwall and everyone else who listened to my rants :-)
10:18  mekwall: heh np
10:18  cojack: ajpiano: call binded event in jquery from pure js
10:18  ajpiano: that's what .trigger() should do
10:18  ajpiano: if you want to trigger the jquery-bound handlers
10:19  cojack: ajpiano: can you show me simple example?
10:19  cojack: I don't thinks so I get it
10:19  cherrypie_: Can we talk about Jquery for mobile phone application development, or is there a channel for that too?
10:21  kefafo: ajpiano: thank you, you were correct. it was with the registration
10:21  ajpiano: cherrypie_, yes, you can
10:22  norbi: hi guys, i'm trying to get the current height of an img with img.height(); and it returns 0; the width is very ok...
10:22  cherrypie_: Someone mentioned something earlier that is used to.. I believe make web apps.. I think it wraps Jquery code  in objective c or C++, so it work on the Ipad, or Iphone, anyone know the name of that program?
10:23  norbi: what may be this causing
10:23  cojack: ajpiano: can you?
10:23  markj: cherrypie_ it might have been Titanium or Phonegap
10:23  ajpiano: cojack http://jsfiddle.net/aqwzT/
10:24  cojack: dude, it's not that what Im talking about
10:24  cojack: bind submit event for form, and how make it called when I call submit from pure js without using jquery
10:25  ajpiano: you can't
10:25  cojack: I have old code, and I don't want rewrite them
10:25  cojack: ajpiano: so this Is the answer what I need
10:25  cojack: thanks
10:25  ajpiano: that's what i said 15 minutes ago
10:25  cojack: o rly? :P
10:25  ajpiano: [4:10 ] <ajpiano> when you trigger native dom events, you won't get the jquery bound handlers
10:26  cojack: ohhh, sory I miss them...
10:30  cherrypie_: I basically am wanting to make a web app and then port it too all the major devices including Android, iOS, Blackberry, WebOS and OVI, sotre and possibly even port for that  Chumby operating system, I believe sony just bought the right to use it just like HP bought the rights from Palm for WebOS.  This way by developing for such a large target I am bound to make some mucho denerio $$ and I will only have to focus on making one killer
10:30  norbi: why i can't get height of any element in Chrome?
10:30  blackspotwiggins: cherrypie_, web apps by definition use web technologies, not C++
10:31  ablomen: is there someone in here able and willing to test one small thing in ie7? i don't have access to a computer that has it atm
10:31  sean`: dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/text.html - vs http://gruppler.dojotoolkit.org/ (BlockFadeOut) -- If you place "<a href="">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Morbi nibh. Maecenas metus nisi, tempus sed.</a>" the dojo one it fades perfectly word by word, howeffs mine doesn't :(
10:32  cherrypie_: I am talking about using some easier languages like jquery, php, and maybe some python.. someone was telling me there are programs out there that will do the C++ for me.
10:32  sean`: http://dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/text.html *
10:32  nlogax: blackspotwiggins: what about native client?
10:32  ajpiano: cherrypie_, look at PhoneGap
10:32  blackspotwiggins: nlogax, a bit too early for that i think..
10:32  blackspotwiggins: but yeah, that is a future possbility
10:32  blackspotwiggins: cant wait for how do i access pointers with jquery ajax 2.0 web tech
10:32  nlogax: blackspotwiggins: i just mean, it's "web technology", and allows you to write C(++) (and more stuff soon i think)
10:33  cherrypie_: ajpiano You are awesome!  I remember now, that is what the guy was talking about.. I sure hope its open source, because opens source rocks..ha
10:33  nlogax: i think it's moving to llvm, or already did..
10:33  ablomen: http://zinzi.nl/index.php << on this page there should be a big yellow pane that warns you your browser sucks in case you are running ie < 8
10:34  ajpiano: PhoneGap is an open source development framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
10:34  blackspotwiggins: nlogax, i think it has potential for being great. but even more potential to be horribly misused by noobs. also security.
10:35  nlogax: blackspotwiggins: yeah, time will tell. would be pretty sweet to have more than 1 thing to choose from, as it is now:)
10:35  cherrypie_: that is so sweet, I saw something like that I think its name was appcelerator, but they wanted a lot of money.. so I will surely check phonegap out I hope I can really develop iOS from a none mac computer that would be so awesome.
10:37  norbi: guys, would you like please help me too a bit?
10:38  lonimurar: no
10:38  ablomen: sean`, how about wrapping the links in a div that has the same dimensions and fading the a's out?
10:38  sean`: ablomen, it needs to be word by word
10:38  ablomen: ah right i see
10:38  sean`: iunno why the one from dojo doesn't do that
10:39  sean`: and my devtools are acting really strange -.-
10:39  mekwall: lonimurar: I'm a bit slow... but I would do: if ($('p').not('.active').length > 0) { ... }
10:39  sean`: ablomen, by running http://pastebin.com/bZmNEcAx that one will last 10 seconds
10:40  sean`: if you put my markup in the text box, you can see how it's affected a bit more precise
10:40  lonimurar: mekwall: thanks!
10:40  cherrypie_: Did you guys know apple opened up their devices for the first time for adobe based products.  I think you can make adobe air, action script, and some type of flash program and they actually work on the ipad.   Flash videos still don't work for some reason but everything else does if it's done right, imagine cross coding with adobe products, html5, and jquery.. you could probably make a nice app right?
10:40  mekwall: if ($('p').not('.active').length) { ... }
10:40  mekwall: even
10:42  mekwall: lonimurar: if you need to do something with the elements, cache them :) var $p = $('p'); if ($p.not('.active').length) { /* whatever we do with $p here, it will happen if all of them have .active */ };
10:47 --- tbk is now known as mpeeters
10:49  cherrypie_: I need your guys help, what are the 3 or 4 programming/scripting  languages I should learn to make a killer web app- then like I said b4 I plan to develop it so it suitable for mobile phones and port it too all the  marketplace out there.   I know HTML definitely is a first (even though I code some but not, HTML5) then I am going to study and play with Jquery in depth.. what other languages are hot right now (for my purpose of course
10:51  Vorspire: php
10:52  Vorspire: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript are the fundimental languages for website development imo
10:52  JKarsrud: not PHP
10:52  JKarsrud: It's not essential
10:52  Vorspire: I couldn't live without PHP :P
10:53  sean`: html, css, js, <serverside>
10:53  JKarsrud: HTML, CSS and JS are fundimental
10:53  dominikl: hi guys, does anyone know how i can disable the automatic styling of a select-box with jquerymobile?
10:53  JKarsrud: sean`: Exactly
10:53  sean`: and the language of STFU
10:55  Vorspire: I coudn't imagine building a website without PHP these days :P
10:55  sean`: Vorspire, look at my issue plzktnx
10:55  Vorspire: what's your issue? :)
10:56  cherrypie_: I was thinking about Python since most people say it's friendly and easy to learn, I think there is even a PyWebKit that works with HTML5.  I have months and months that I can spend to self learn with nothing but myself stopping me.  I also have enough funds to get any book/ebook that I need, even might take training classes.   If you were stuck out in a jungle (w/ a laptop and 4g of course) and you had to make the best app ever what
10:57 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
10:57  ablomen: cherrypie_, http://nodejs.org/
10:59  ablomen: sean`, they don't seem to actually manipulate the existing dom, or at least, thats the best i can make of it
10:59  ablomen: they just change the opacity to 0 and put whatever it is over it
10:59  cherrypie_: Anybody learn more than one language at a time I am planning about 5 actually,  HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript/Jquery, and Python and C++ (you think python or c++, especially python for web, can help make the killer web app better)
11:00  sean`: ablomen, it does
11:00  sean`: ooh
11:00  sean`: ablomen, but the elements aren't position: absolute
11:00  sean`: so, how can you put them on top of 'em
11:00  ablomen: sean`, offset etc
11:00  unfo-: cherrypie_, why would you learn php AND python AND c++ at the same time?
11:00  sean`: yeah, but the element needs position: absolute for that
11:00  bryandowning: Are there optimal hours to be in this channel (when jquery is the main topic of discussion)?
11:00  sean`: yet, they aren't
11:01  sean`: and what I can make of it, is that they do change the DOm
11:01  unfo-: cherrypie_, learning basics of c++ first and then php makes some sense since php is descendend from c/c++; but versus python it's a wholly different thing
11:01  ablomen: sean`, right, ill do this in dutch
11:01  sean`: http://gyazo.com/e2e1c37de2fd87dbd70ce82f1878a270.png
11:02  sean`: bryandowning, every hour of the day bro!
11:03  lonimurar: $(this).prev('a.foobar').add('span.foobar').removeClass('active');
11:03  lonimurar: this should work right?
11:03  ablomen: sean`, het lijkt er op alsof ze het element hiden (opacity op 0), er iets overheen gooien wat animeert etc, en daarna het element replacen met de nieuwe content, tenminste, dat is alles wat firebug mij laat zien
11:03  cherrypie_: I don't know why, I always wanted to learn python, and I heard some developer including the biggest web app of all time facebook have went back and re-write some of there code in C++ too make it faster.   Thats the only reason i can think of, if Python and C++ are not friendly for Web and Mobile I will step back.
11:03  norbi: i see that jquery with webkit browsers do not calculate well the height and width
11:03 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
11:03  norbi: for height i'm getting 0
11:03  norbi: and it is not an ajax loaded or added element
11:04  sean`: ablomen, dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/dojo.text.js
11:04  unfo-: cherrypie_, python is used quite a lot in web frameworks, c++ is not that much
11:04  sean`: check out " function animatePieces(piece) {"
11:04  Vorspire: norbi; are you using width/height on <img> ?
11:04  norbi: or a div
11:04  norbi: that contains that im
11:04  norbi: img
11:04  Vorspire: img width/height will always be 0 until it's loaded
11:04  unfo-: cherrypie_, and learning c++ for the very highly unlikely scenario of you inventing the next facebook is not that reasonable in my opinion
11:05  eightfold: if '#id1 .class1' is empty this should hide .class1, right?
11:05  eightfold: $("#id1 .class1:empty").closest('.class1').hide();
11:05  eightfold: closest() will not travel up the dom if the current class is the class i want to select?
11:05  sean`: from that I can only see that they're doing the same ;p
11:05  norbi: Vorspire so i think that $(document).ready() is not seiing that its loaded or not
11:05  norbi: how can i check out if its loaded ?
11:06  cherrypie_: Shoot, while I am thinking of Python and C++, I am missing out in Java and Adobe Air, I like adobe air apps and that makes total sense to learn that to make killer mobile apps only if a prog like phone gap, would make it run on different mobiles OS's
11:06  Vorspire: $(document).load instead of .ready
11:06  Vorspire: load will fire when everything including images is loaded
11:06  ablomen: sean`, ah lol i was looking at an entirely different demo XD
11:06  unfo-: cherrypie_, so i would suggest going with python or php instead of c++ if you are learning new stuff. i'd even go as far as suggesting python instead of php since python is a more useful a tool outside of web context whereas php isn't
11:07  sean`: -.-
11:07  norbi: Vorspire, thanks, lets see, if it works i get you a beer ! :)
11:07  sean`: hahahaha
11:07  sean`: omg
11:07 --- frigginCommute is now known as seutje
11:07  Vorspire: if you learn PHP, you'll be able to easily transfer that skill into JS and other things like C#
11:07  lonimurar: this should remove the 'active' class from the prev a.foobar (this works) and every span.foobar (this doesn't): $(this).prev('a.foobar').add('span.foobar').removeClass('active');
11:07  blackspotwiggins: Vorspire, like naming stuff with $names :)
11:07  lonimurar: what am I doing wrong?
11:07  markj: cherrypie_ facebook is written in PHP and they use HipHop to compile it as C++ https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/
11:07  unfo-: cherrypie_, well Air is quite a neat idea for cross-platform coding. but i suggest taking up one tech at a time. choose one, learn it and then either stick with it or learn a new one. but don't try to do a million things at once
11:08  markj: well, transform it sorry
11:08  Vorspire: blackspotwiggins; I don't get it, lol
11:08  blackspotwiggins: php variables always begin with $
11:08  cherrypie_: Ok I am not going to learn C++ anymore but will keep python.  But how about replacing C++ with java, that is for both the web, and other apps as well, what about adobe air man, that is some good technology, what is behind that actionscript..and what?
11:08  Vorspire: well yeah, but that's not what I meant :P there's plenty of transferable skills :D
11:08  blackspotwiggins: true
11:09  blackspotwiggins: it's also very easy to learn sloppy coding with php and transfer THAT
11:09  seutje: I am yet to see an air app that doesn't either eat my memory, or simply doesn't feel like installing
11:09  Vorspire: blackspotwiggins; also very true :D
11:09  sean`: omnomnomnom
11:09  markj: adobe air is just a wrapper pretty much
11:09  blackspotwiggins: yeah, air is the suck
11:09  blackspotwiggins: wrapper is extremely leaky and slow
11:10  sean`: that's not air
11:10  blackspotwiggins: oh it is
11:10  sean`: that's adobe > *
11:10  unfo-: cherrypie_, java / other jvm languages are widely used as the backend technology on a lot of web sites. but i still say: learn one thing first, then look for the next thing :)
11:10  seutje: it's a wrapper of thick goo instead of air
11:10  markj: haha
11:10  seutje: slowing everything down and making it nasty
11:10  markj: true, im not a fan
11:10  blackspotwiggins: my previous webapp took 1.4 gb of ram when left running in AIR overnight
11:10  seutje: now with extra leaks!
11:10  cherrypie_: True Air does eat memory, but some program are really useful I use a adobe air todolist and calander everday.  What is the technology behind that again, my bad if you already mentioned it?
11:11  blackspotwiggins: seutje, dont forget custom UI made to imitate native
11:11  blackspotwiggins: but that fails horribly
11:11  blackspotwiggins: ?g adobe ui gripes
11:11  bot-t: blackspotwiggins, Daring Fireball Linked List: Adobe UI Gripes - http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/01/26/adobe-ui-gripes
11:11  lonimurar: this should remove the 'active' class from the prev a.foobar (this works) and every span.foobar (this doesn't): $(this).prev('a.foobar').add('span.foobar').removeClass('active');
11:11  lonimurar: what am I doing wrong?
11:11  blackspotwiggins: using mousewheel to scale native app UI, trololololo
11:12  seutje: heh, so silly
11:12  sean`: Vorspire, have you looked yet !?
11:12  norbi: Vorspire: $(document).load(); never fires up
11:12  norbi: in chrome
11:13  Vorspire: hmm what where who when
11:13  seutje: so u have the freedom to make it look however u want
11:13  blackspotwiggins: LIKE ASS
11:13  seutje: :P
11:13  Vorspire: $(document.body).load(...) ?
11:13  Vorspire: sean` whaaaaaaaa
11:15  norbi: Vorspire: $(document.body).load(function(){ alert($("img").height()) });
11:15  norbi: nothing happens
11:16  Vorspire: norbi; it's because the images are cached, i think
11:16  norbi: so?
11:17  Vorspire: ?preloadImages @ norbi
11:17  bot-t: norbi, preloadImages | jQuery Plugins - preloadImages makes it easy to preload any image, or a list of images. Just call $.preloadImages(['myimage1.jpg', 'myimage2.jpg']); and it'll do all the work for you - preloading one image at a tim... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/preloadImages
11:17  norbi: i wil try that
11:17  norbi: l
11:18  norbi: thanks:)
11:18  cherrypies: I am going to be studying different languages each day, like I was in school taking 5 different classes. I will make sure to do my homework and take lots of advice.  There have been lost of "one man" teams that made the next big thing, I don't even want the next big thing maybe the biggest small thing our something, as long as I learn, have fun, and make money at the same time I will be happy. Studying 6 + hours a day.. maybe in 6 mo
11:18  blackspotwiggins: cherrypies, look at functional programming. thats the future (some say)
11:18  Tosak: Hello all! I have a problem with the change event not firing when using the browsers sutosuggest feature. Anyone know if this is a known issue?
11:18  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: but i don't want to select multiple, .class1 is inside #id1 and i only want to select .class1 if it is inside #id1, hence '#id1 .class1'. correct, no?
11:19  Tosak: *autosuggest that is
11:19  blackspotwiggins: eightfold, huh?
11:19  cherrypies: Functional programming
11:19  cherrypies: What is that I swear I read something about that.
11:19  norbi: Vorspire: preloadImages is included now in Jquery?
11:19  blackspotwiggins: cherrypies, a different style of programming. C and friends are imperative, functional is declarative
11:19  Vorspire: norbi; I don't know, I thought it was a plugin
11:20  sean`: Vorspire, check <sean`> dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/text.html - vs http://gruppler.dojotoolkit.org/ (BlockFadeOut) -- If you place "<a href="">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Morbi nibh. Maecenas metus nisi, tempus sed.</a>" the dojo one it fades perfectly word by word, howeffs mine doesn't :(
11:20  blackspotwiggins: cherrypies, also logic programming is nifty, but even more mindfuck for me
11:20  cherrypies: Isn't it supposed to be the next new wave of computer science that teaches programming to liberal art students and is not math intesnive as some computer sceience degrees
11:21  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: ok, better example. should .class1 get hidden here: $(".class1:empty").closest('.class1').hide();
11:21  blackspotwiggins: cherrypies, err, dont think so
11:21  lonimurar: this should remove the 'active' class from the prev a.foobar (this works) and every span.foobar (this doesn't): $(this).prev('a.foobar').add('span.foobar').removeClass('active');
11:21  lonimurar: what am I doing wrong?
11:21  blackspotwiggins: eightfold, your last example would work if you had <div class='class1'><a class='class1'></div>
11:22  blackspotwiggins: or something
11:22  cherrypies: Ok that is something else I read about, very intresting- oh yeah that was python I think, it talked about computer science for everyone, saying everyone can learn to program.
11:22  blackspotwiggins: but it doesnt make much sense
11:22  Tosak: Using the browsers autofill feature on a form field = Change event not firing. Anyone have experience with this? When I type a letter, then use the suggest feature to fill it it fires, but when I just dclick the field and select a value it dosent
11:22  Tosak: Sorry for the repetitions, just need to draw some attention to myself :P
11:23  Vorspire: sean` looks fine to me :S
11:23  cherrypies: Should I read a book about the DOM or like the aspect of WebKit before I get deep into javascript and Jquery
11:23  sean`: Vorspire, no
11:23  sean`: it doesn't
11:23  blackspotwiggins: ?101 @ cherrypies
11:23  bot-t: cherrypies, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
11:23  sean`: Vorspire, if you animate mine, you see underlining on the <a>
11:23  Vorspire: how can you tell what my perception of this world is? :D
11:23  blackspotwiggins: thats a very good intro
11:23  sean`: On dojo you don't
11:23  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: but according to the closest() doc ( http://api.jquery.com/closest/ )   "The .closest() method _begins its search with the element itself_ before progressing up the DOM tree"
11:23  Vorspire: ahh yeah you're right
11:23  sean`: Iknow
11:24  cherrypies: I am not new just very dusty..lol
11:24  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: so there shouldn't have to be an element inside an element, both with .class1, as i interpret the documentation
11:24  cherrypies: I actually took a class and got a good grade in college.. but my memory not that good.
11:24  Superman_: ..
11:24  cherrypies: I didn't keep up.
11:24  blackspotwiggins: eightfold, seems like it does
11:25  blackspotwiggins: but that would be stupid
11:25  blackspotwiggins: why would you use $(".something").closest(".something") to get the same elements
11:25  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: what do you mean by "seems like it does"?
11:25  norbi: Vorspire: how can i now if the image was preloaded?
11:25  cherrypies: Bot-t but thanks for that link, I will read since I need to brush up.   Anyone else sent me a link can you please resend it, my browser crashed on me.
11:26  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: messy story, i can only change js, not too much of the html.
11:26  blackspotwiggins: the question is still valid
11:27  eightfold: blackspotwiggins: yeah, the doc and other sites clearly states it should start with "itself". if it matches it should not travel up the dom tree.
11:27  blackspotwiggins: so why would you use $(".something").closest(".something") to get the same elements
11:28  Tosak: Hoping my question dosen't get busied as fast this time :P Is monitoring for a browsers autofill on a form field only possible with some kind of setInterval? .change dosen't fire
11:29  Tosak: *buried
11:29  cherrypies: I need to be like a spon/ge right now, and since you guys already been there- what books/websites would you recommened, so I can take the intelligent fast pace to learning the art and science of web/mobile app dev

11:31  mekwall: lol
11:31  blackspotwiggins: cherrypies, the eloquent js one is a nice beginning. i recommend steve souders vooks for learning about fast web
11:31  blackspotwiggins: books even
11:31  JKarsrud: vooks!
11:31  mekwall: actually, I did short it... and thought I copied the shorted url :)
11:31  bsod2: tinyurl has its merits
11:32  mekwall: http://bit.ly/gRXFkQ
11:32  JKarsrud: bsod doesn't
11:32  mekwall: that was the link I was supposed to paste haha
11:32  bsod2: :)
11:32  cherrypies: My books are all pretty old around 2004-5 I think.
11:32  mekwall: that theme looks ok?

11:33  cherrypies: I am looking it up in the kindle right now hope he has some kindle editions!
11:34  cherrypies: I am so tired right now I will buy any book you run across me..lol
11:35  cherrypies: Then when I wake up I will actually get some use out of them.
11:36  cherrypies: Mekwall
11:36  mekwall: cherrypies: y?
11:37  cherrypies: How did you learn most of Jquery/Javascript was there any book or website that helped you along the way, or accelerated your learning?
11:37  mekwall: sure
11:38  mekwall: cherrypies: jquery.com, http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page, http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials :P
11:39  mekwall: cherrypies: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html
11:39  mekwall: that's a good start
11:39  mekwall: the author is in here, rmurphey
11:40  cherrypies: Every one has different opinions!  One guy told me javascript mostly sucks, and was made at the time as a incomple language, and I should read "Javascript the Good Parts" because it has the only thing I really need.
11:40  cherrypies: But I doubt it, I still think I am going to read "Javascript the good parts" though.
11:41  mekwall: don't waste your time on "real" books
11:41  mekwall: most of the time they are outdated
11:41  Xedecimal: ok, I do something like $('#id').click(function () { ### $(this) is now set to what I want to update ###; $.post('target', { id: value }, function () { ### $(this) is now my ajax result, how to I get my event sender back? ### }); }
11:41  rambo3: jQuery("#edit-betwean").daterangepicker is not a function
11:42  cherrypies: I know I have a book sitting right here, and I am like why even read it - it was prob made before the term "ajax" got coined!
11:42  Xedecimal: I could have my post result json with the id I sent it, then use like $('#type-'+id).text('Updated!'); but that seems like not the right way to go
11:42  mekwall: cherrypies: well... the JavaScript we know today, is actually ECMAScript
11:42  mekwall: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript
11:42  cherrypies: yeah I know that much :-)
11:42  mekwall: woah ok :)
11:42  mekwall: that's good
11:42  red: Can anyone suggest a way to track Flash clicks when I have no control over the flash content?
11:44  cherrypies: the guy was going on and on how there is much better languages than javascript and how a top few corporations got control over what get implemented into a web browser so you really have no choice but to learn what they make you
11:44  mekwall: red: cover it with a transparent div and hook a click event to it? :p
11:44  red: good idea, but how will the click go through?
11:45  red: wont the div on top of the flash make the flash uninteractable?
11:45  Tosak: If you use the browsers autofill feature to fill a form field, the change event dosen't seem to fire. There has to be a keydown on the field first. Not sure if this is a bug, similar to this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6109 - Anyone?
11:45  cherrypies: So, those 3 tutorials is all I really need.   Thank you!
11:46  Xedecimal: is there something that can parse what serialize() would have created? Eg. test=val turning into { test: val } ?
11:47 * red pokes mekwall 
11:48  mekwall: red: hehe it won't work :)
11:48  mekwall: red: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1789233/track-a-click-on-a-flash-movie-object-embed-with-jquery
11:48  mekwall: that's what you are looking for
11:48  red: yes except I can't tweak the flash, hence that method wont work
11:48  red: i did google on it before asking :)
11:48  red: offsite resources I have no control over but been ordered to make trackable (damn management)

11:50  cherrypies: Just found the perfect book!!!!!    Building Iphohe Apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript by -Jonathan Stark
11:50  sean`: Vorspire, nope
11:50  mekwall: red: if you don't care about IE7 or earlier... $(window).hashchange(function () { .. }
11:50  sean`: that's wrong
11:50  ruby_on_tails: make it html, css and jquery man

11:51  ruby_on_tails: Vorspire: dont cry
11:51  cherrypies: I really need to find the same book but instead of Iphone it says Android :-(
11:51  levu: how can i watch a property like window.opener.closed so that a callback is called when this property changes? Is there a way without setInverval?
11:51  ruby_on_tails: cherrypies: #android :D
11:51  cherrypies: I dont even have a mac to buid apps w/
11:51  cherrypies: Okaydoky
11:52  ruby_on_tails: cherrypies: #android-dev even
11:52  cherrypies: Yeah I wish the book said Jquery instead of Javascript too.   Boo!
11:54  cherrypies: ruby_on_tails   I am looking to make a web app w/ jquery and others see.  and then port them over too different mobile phone --so an android or apple channel don't really fit me.  I need to learn web apps first.
11:55  ruby_on_tails: cherrypies: hmm
11:55  cherrypies: But knowing its possible to use those languages and jquery alone to build a Iphone app, especially know since there is book named after it, it gives me hope!
11:55  ruby_on_tails: then start with php/asp
11:55  cherrypies: now(

11:56  cherrypies: Yes PHP, I have a lynda tutorial that I never tried yet, but it old is dirt!  Things are always changing and I don't want to learn all the old bits
11:56  cherrypies: It was an expensive tutorial too!
11:57  Hornet-: just use isohunt
11:57  Hornet-: lynda is overpriced and outdated
11:57  Vorspire: mekwall; for each char ? :D
11:58  Hornet-: unusual problem: how would be best to syncronise an event on multiple client browsers, at $time as specified by the _server_?
11:58  ruby_on_tails: cherrypies: lynda is no good, jump into the thing you wanna make
11:59  ruby_on_tails: its not only overprice but its a great lullaby for me atleast

12:21  pi3r: hi all
12:21  cherrypies: dang no one to talk too now :-(
12:21  cherrypies: Hey pi3r
12:21  cherrypies: you new to jquery?
12:22  pi3r: my js files are now served by a cdn but i  get an error 500 when i make an ajax call
12:22  pi3r: surely an same origin policy issue
12:22  pi3r: but i'm not sure how to fix it
12:24  cherrypies: yeah i am not one to help.  I still have to learn jquery, all I know right now is basic javascript.
12:24  JKarsrud: pi3r: Did it work before you used cdn?
12:24  cherrypies: i am actually asking people for jquery books to read thats why i am here
12:24  pi3r: JKarsrud, yep
12:25  JKarsrud: are all your files served from a cdn, or just your library files?
12:25  cherrypies: that and because jquery is something i really want to learn bad.
12:25  pi3r: library are loaded using google ajax api
12:25  pi3r: my js per pages are loaded from a cdn
12:26  JKarsrud: Aha, then it sounds like a same origin issue
12:26  pi3r: so my js are loaded from www.static-mysite.com
12:26  pi3r: then i do request on /controller/action :D
12:26  pi3r: so www.mysite.com/controller/action
12:26  pi3r: ...
12:26 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
12:27  JKarsrud: Is there a reason you serve all your files from a cdn instead of having them locally on your server?
12:27  pi3r: minimizing http request?
12:28  pi3r: and the size of the headers
12:28  JKarsrud: Other than that. You could always concatenate and minify your scripts :)
12:28  pi3r: done
12:28  pi3r: :)
12:28  JKarsrud: Allright :)
12:28  pi3r: it's just the final step
12:28  pi3r: :)
12:29  JKarsrud: Well, it sounds like a same origin policy issue for sure
12:30  JKarsrud: do you serve from a subdomain, or is it www.static-mysite.com?
12:30  pi3r: static-mysite :)
12:31  norbi: i'm trying to get the original size of an image in chrome, the image is distorsioned, it takes the width and the height of the parent element, img.removeAttr("width"); width=img.width() returns me the current width; not the original
12:32  JKarsrud: pi3r: Could this be helpful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing ?
12:32  hokapoka: pi3r:You need to set the right headers
12:33  hokapoka: Also you need to beaware that FF & Chrome do "pre-flight" requests to obtain the headers before the post
12:33  pi3r: hokapoka, so i have to "proxify" each response?
12:33  hokapoka: The pre-flight requests are using the  "OPTIONS" method.
12:33  pi3r: JKarsrud, thanks :)
12:34  hokapoka: Ensure you have the right headers, Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* - or the origins you are setting
12:34  Xtracted: good morning
12:35  pi3r: hokapoka, hum let my try that
12:35  hokapoka: Additionally, I found a need to inc. Access-Control-Allow-Headers:Content-Type

12:36  flayks: do you know why the nothash array doesn't work in a $.inArray(window.location.hash.substr(1), nothash) == -1 condition ?
12:36  hokapoka: As for how I handle it, I set the headers in a seperate handler for OPTIONS, so that any browsers that do the Pre-flight request that come-in with OPTIONS get passes to a seperate handler that sets the headers, however, for IE & the XdomainRequest object it doesn't do any pre-flight so you need to set them in the actual handler too.

12:37  jetienne: q. i launch a jquery ajax call, but i would like to be able to interrupt it before its end. how can i do that ?
12:38  hokapoka: pi3r: one thing to remember, this is on the service you are sending the request to, not the page that contains the html that going to make the request.
12:39  iainvdw: anyone have experience with the jquery cycle plugin?
12:39  iainvdw: i want to set a different animation for the next and previous methods

12:40  JKarsrud: Or am I missing something?
12:41  Xtracted: JKarsrud: you assign buttons to a modal dialog when you create the dialog, not in the content of the dialog
12:41  JKarsrud: Xtracted: Yeah, I know that, that's what I mean

12:42  Xtracted: JKarsrud: and the buttons object doesnt seem to accept a icon variable
12:42  pi3r: didn't know about access-control-allow-origin
12:42  jetienne: Hornet: socket.io makes it relativly easy to use cross brower
12:42  hokapoka: pi3r: are you using the XDomainRequest object in > ie8
12:42  JKarsrud: Xtracted: Like buttons: { "New button": function() { $(this).addClass("ui-icon-something"); } };
12:43  JKarsrud: Don't know if it'll work, but might be worth a shot :)
12:43  hokapoka: As there are a whole bunch of restrictions.
12:43  JKarsrud: this would be the button, so
12:43  Hornet: hrm, interesting
12:44  flayks: do you know why the nothash array doesn't work in the if with the $.inArray ? http://jsfiddle.net/Flayks/6ps4U/
12:44  pi3r: hokapoka, dunno about that -_- just using jquery :)
12:44  hokapoka: Hornet: are you after a PUSH from the server then?
12:44  Altreus: There's a method similar to live() that does something else now-and-in-the-future but I can't remember what it's called to find out if it does what I want. Any ideas?
12:44  JKarsrud: delegate
12:45  Xtracted: JKarsrud: Nope, doesnt work... Found this while searching: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2525524/jquery-ui-dialog-button-icons

12:45  johnline: anyone know how i connect to a website with specifying the domain ip?
12:45  Altreus: darn that's not it
12:45  hokapoka: pi3r: oh, I didn't use the jquery AJAX tools.  not sure if it uses it.  I've created a simplified version of socket.io that PUSHs to the client from a service that I run on all my sites.
12:45  Hornet: hokapoka: sort of
12:45  Hornet: ideally yes,but that wouldn't work in old browsers
12:45  johnline: cause we're getting the wrong ip resolved
12:45  Hornet: I'm thinnking maybe ajax polling
12:46  Hornet: with the final request synchronous
12:46  Altreus: I want all elements that match my selector to be droppable, now-and-in-the-future style
12:46  JKarsrud: johnline: Add it in the hosts-file?
12:46  hokapoka: Hornet: socket.io does work in older browsers.
12:46  Hornet: hrm
12:46  Hornet: ie6+?
12:46  hokapoka: It'll drop down to a hiddne iframe if it hasn't got flash
12:46  Hornet: aha
12:46  Altreus: I can of course do $(selector).droppable() for now, but would I have to do it again in the future?
12:46  johnline: ok will try JKarsrud thanks
12:46  JKarsrud: Or access the IP directly?
12:46  Hornet: interesting, thanks
12:46  johnline: http://84.22.161.185/
12:46  hokapoka: What have you got on the server?
12:46  johnline: direct ip goes to horster
12:46  johnline: *hoster
12:47  Altreus: Is there an element-created event that I can use with live to say, when an element that matches the selector is created, do stuff?
12:47  cojack: hmmm
12:47  cojack: how to set value to input working with datepicker from jquery ui?
12:47  JKarsrud: Altreus: jQuery UI-stuff isn't delegateable, but just reinit the droppable() when you create the element?
12:47  cojack: if I pass them some, they erase them...
12:47  Altreus: JKarsrud: yar that's what I thought I'd do
12:48  JKarsrud: That's the way
12:48  Altreus: JKarsrud: Actually I thought I'd refactor it so I can use clone(true)
12:48  JKarsrud: Yeah, might work too, if you really want a clone
12:48  Altreus: Pretty sure that's feasible with what Ihave
12:48  Altreus: I'm already using clone, it's just the handlers aren't there when I clone it
12:49  hokapoka: cojack: can you clarify what you mean>
12:50  JKarsrud: Altreus: Why not pass in a boolean with clone, so that you can copy event handlers etc?
12:50  JKarsrud: ?clone
12:50  bot-t: .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
12:50  hokapoka: You have got an input and you've set it to use the datepicker via : $(".selector").datepicker({opts...});
12:51  Altreus: JKarsrud: Yes, that's what I meant. I am just working out how to shuffle my code around so the handlers exist at the right point :)
12:53  Hornet: hokapoka: is there a way to use sockets.io on a lamp server?

14:02  g0rd0n: basically i am adding, via jquery, images directly after being uploaded. the problem is, if i upload an image which replaces an existing one, the browser will still show the old image from cache... is there any way i can force a reload of the image?
14:02  levu: Aamir: ok, i forget it :D
14:02  levu: g0rd0n: you can make the url like ?cache=<currentTImeStamp>
14:03  levu: g0rd0n: if the query string changes, the browser reloads the image from the server instead of taking it from the cache
14:03  Aamir: g0rd0n:  append something to the old image url        something.png?blabla=blabla

15:51  markj: sean` you should probably remove the console logs
15:51  themodr2: hi
15:51  sean`: yeah
15:51  sean`: it's in dev :p
15:51  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, nice, except for one thing :)
15:52  blackspotwiggins: align the key on login to text
15:52  markj: id tell you to use paul irishs console log wrapper but you probably know about it id imagine, but then im forgetful and sometimes leave them in
15:52  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: that's default  jquery ui styles on the button
15:53  blackspotwiggins: tweak it ;)
15:53  mekwall: well, positioning and sizing that is :)
15:53  blackspotwiggins: you can modify the line-height of text
15:53  mekwall: probably
15:53  mekwall: well already tried
15:53  mekwall: didn't change anything :)
15:53  blackspotwiggins: thing is, the close to perfect you get, the more small errors annoy you
15:53  blackspotwiggins: closer*

15:54  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, nice..
15:54  blackspotwiggins: i would work on those pixel perfect things for a bit :)
15:54  blackspotwiggins: otherwise looking very good
15:55  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: yeah, want to reuse as much as possible
15:55  blackspotwiggins: bottom padding is 1px bigger and right is 5px bigger
15:55  Hopsy: sean`: how did they cut the div's into thousand pieces?
15:55  blackspotwiggins: also, it would look nice if labels lined up with text in the inputs

15:58  JenniferB2: .length() ?
15:59  Cork:  jQuery('.myClass').length
15:59  bot-t: JenniferB2, .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
15:59  alaing: JenniferB2: yes u can use .length
15:59  blackspotwiggins: Qci, use classes for hiding and add/removeClass
15:59  Qci: thanks

16:03  mekwall: didn't get that
16:03  blackspotwiggins: look at the space left to the input
16:03  blackspotwiggins: and then to right of the input
16:03  blackspotwiggins: now back to me
16:03  blackspotwiggins: the input is diamonds
16:03  mekwall: lol
16:03  mekwall: hahaha
16:04  blackspotwiggins: but srsly, the right side has more whitespace
16:04  mekwall: in the button?

16:05  blackspotwiggins: alaing, fix your script
16:05  blackspotwiggins: probably infinite loop
16:05  alaing: which is faster using clases for hiding/ showing using add/remove class or using .show and .hide
16:05  peol: alaing: sounds more like you're doing something DOM-heavy/looping
16:05  blackspotwiggins: and that's measured in execution time not memory afaik
16:06  johnline: http://pastebin.com/cyJdwsE7
16:06  johnline: is there anything wrong with this?
16:06  alaing: I'm not using any hand made loops
16:06  alaing: $.inarray
16:07  alaing: a couple of times
16:07  alaing: but mostly filtering out rows from a table and using .show/hide
16:08  jomofcw: What is your opinion about defer the laoding of jquery ?
16:09  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: kinda stupid... ui-button have a right margin by default
16:09  mekwall: 0.4em
16:09  mekwall: probably to make some space when having two or more buttons side-by-side
16:09  blackspotwiggins: it's probably for when there are multiple buttons next to eachother
16:10  blackspotwiggins: .ui-button + .ui-button { margin-left:.4em }
16:10  alaing: great minds think alike lol
16:10  blackspotwiggins: same effect
16:10  blackspotwiggins: but only when there are multiple buttons
16:11  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: wonder why they didn't think of that :D
16:11  blackspotwiggins: BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ME MUHAHAHHAHA
16:12  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: true
16:12  blackspotwiggins: IMO it would be better to have padding on the container rather than the button

16:17  jomofcw: What is your opinion about defer the loading of jquery ? And what about loading script not in the HEAD element but at the bottom of BODY element ?
16:17  alaing: because the function that I'm getting the long script error uses .show /hide
16:17  dAnjou: hi, i need some fancy jquery image crop tool. i found some, but as always i'm not sure which one is state-of-the-art. can you recommend one?
16:17  blackspotwiggins: jomofcw, head is the worst place load scripts like jquery
16:17  alaing: quiet a bit and a lot of filtering
16:17  blackspotwiggins: alaing, use profiling to find out what takes the most time
16:17  timmywil: jomofcw, only modernizr or headjs needs to be loading in the head
16:17  timmywil: load other scripts at the end of the body
16:18  blackspotwiggins: firebug/webkit devtools are quite good for that
16:18  jomofcw: timmywil blackspotwiggins OK thanks :)
16:18  timmywil: or use a script loader
16:18  alaing: blackspotwiggins: i only get the error on ie and i dont have any ie debugging tool
16:18  Tallisman: i like to keep al js at the head.. clean code..
16:18  blackspotwiggins: alaing, you can profile on other browsers too
16:19  Tallisman: anyhow.. i had a question.. i got a function, this.function1 = function() { }, and i want to do something like this in function 2: function1()
16:19  alaing: yeah i just thought there maybe code that gets executed in one browser but not in anohter and so profiling in another browser would seem a bit pointless
16:20  blackspotwiggins: there is some
16:20  blackspotwiggins: but you get the general idea
16:20  blackspotwiggins: from other browsers too
16:20  blackspotwiggins: almost always the problem is algorithmic
16:20  alaing: let me give it a try
16:21  timmywil: tallisman, it depends on what you're loading, but you're blocking the page by putting them in the head.  If the site or app is large enough, this makes a big difference.  It is best practice to put them at the end of the body.
16:21  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: http://gyazo.com/33555f462093c3ff5018620769227d51.png
16:21  Tallisman: oh.. well that is a great tip timmywill, i'll remember
16:21  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, now it looks like right side is narrower
16:21  blackspotwiggins: :/
16:21  alaing: apparent;y 38 % of the time is used on add()
16:22  blackspotwiggins: alaing, are you caching your selectors?
16:22  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: yeah that's right, by one pix :p
16:23  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: I've set the width of the inputs manually
16:23  Tallisman: anyhow.. i had a question.. i got a function, this.function1 = function() { }, and i want to do something like this in function 2: function1() <-- the thing i want is to call a function that is not found in the function i am calling the function from, therefore the function is not known. how do i call it :P?
16:23  mekwall: can't do 100% because of padding :/
16:23  alaing: blackspotwiggins: I was but then my script seemed to be taking longer
16:23  timmywil: tallisman, also that is a scoping problem, you're trying to call a function that doesn't yet exist in the scope of function 2, cause it's the same function.  And it might put you in an infinite loop
16:24  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: checkbox is ok yes?
16:24  blackspotwiggins: looks ok
16:24  Tallisman: it is a scoping problem, but wont put me in an infinite loop since i am trying to call a function from another function :P
16:25  timmywil: tallisman, maybe im reading it wrong
16:25  timmywil: ok so function 2 is in a separate function definition?
16:25  Tallisman: i'll post a code sample :P, clearification
16:25  timmywil: k
16:26  alaing: how do i clear cached selectors
16:26  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: you think I should style the checkbox/radios as well? :P
16:26  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, it's quite hard to do
16:26  mekwall: yeah I know
16:26  blackspotwiggins: dont bother
16:26  blackspotwiggins: at first anyway
16:27  epichero: Can anyone recommend a plugin for table creation? Or, really template plugins in general?

16:29  Cork: Tallisman: call this.function2() instead of function()

16:35  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: with the toolbar "minimized"
16:35  Cork: alaing: or delete mySelector if you want to remove the variable
16:35  Cork: (not needed though)
16:35  Cork: it will die with the scope if you don't
16:35  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: it's a one-page interface, so the tabs on the bottom left actually work :)
16:35  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: will change the content of the middle area

16:36  mekwall: only 20 minutes left on my work-day, then it's christmas after-work :D
16:36  Cork: alaing: just to make it clear, a cached jquery selector is just that your storing the object $() returns instead of calling $() each time
16:36  Tallisman: in this country we do not really celebrate christmas..
16:37  mekwall: Tallisman: yeah but I only slept for about 5 hours
16:37  Cork: alaing: no greater magic

17:12  sean`: alaing, as in what? extend it?
17:12  Vorspire: alaing; .add?
17:13  sean`: $('foo').alaing () ? or what Vorspire
17:13  sean`: said
17:13  Vorspire: xD
17:13  Vorspire: sean` at what point would pushStack ever be useful btw? I never figured it out
17:13  Vorspire: I guess that's why there's also 0 user comments on that function since 1.0 lol
17:14  sean`: Vorspire, caching
17:14  git__: how old is AJAX ??
17:14  sean`: store multiple objecsta nd instead of using $.fn.each you can use a simple for and you have your object ready
17:14  ajpiano: Vorspire, pushStack is how you return a new set of elements in a jquery fn method
17:14  sean`: git__, older than time itself
17:14  git__: haha
17:15  git__: when did ajax start ?
17:15  alaing: as in I'm looping through a whole lot of tr and if they have a specific value then add them to like some sort of array
17:15  ajpiano: git__, the whole "AJAX" movement started in like, 2005
17:15  ajpiano: ?add @ alaing
17:15  bot-t: alaing, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/

17:15  git__: woah
17:15  dschuett: var printv =  window.open('','PrintWindow','menubar,scrollbars,resizeable=1'); why doesn't that line of code allow me to reisize the new window?
17:15  git__: that's hella fast
17:15  Vorspire: ajpiano, i found using .add was a better solution for what I needed, but if you get a sec could you give me an example of proper usage? if not then np :D
17:15  Vorspire: proper usage of pushStack
17:16  alaing: ajpiano: so if i has var $test= $(); $test.add(this)?
17:16  ajpiano: Vorspire, add calls .pushStack :p
17:16  Vorspire: xD
17:17  ajpiano: alaing, no
17:17  Vorspire: ajpiano, i found the problem was it could only be called once and anything in the previous stack would be overwritten, however, .add seems to continue the last stack and extend it properly
17:17  Pupeno[work]: Does anybody know if there's anything on jquery or a plugin to make two selects where the content of the second depends on the content of the first one?
17:17  ajpiano: Vorspire, the point of pushStack is to overwrite the previous stack
17:17  alaing: ?add
17:17  bot-t: .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
17:17  Vorspire: ahh then fair enough :)
17:17  ajpiano: alaing test = $(".test");  test = test.add(".bar");
17:18  ajpiano: Vorspire, as in like, "i have an element, now i want its .children()...children finds its children, and pushes them on the stack"
17:18  ajpiano: and then that allows .end() to do its magic
17:18  ajpiano: Vorspire, if you look at jQuery source you'll see it all over the place
17:18  Vorspire: ahh I get it :)
17:18  alaing: ajpiano: Can test be an empty jquery object?
17:18  ajpiano: alaing yse
17:18  Vorspire: I thought it was a source specific function tbh
17:19  Vorspire: it doesnt seem to be commonly used otherwise
17:19  alaing: and the .add part has to be a valid jqueyr selector?
17:19  ajpiano: ?add#sig
17:19  bot-t: .add( selector ) | Returns: jQuery | Added in v1.0. http://api.jquery.com/add/
17:19  ajpiano: it can be anything pretty much
17:19  dschuett: var printv =  window.open('','PrintWindow','menubar,scrollbars,resizeable=1'); why doesn't that line of code allow me to reisize the new window?
17:20  ajpiano: dschuett, because "resizable" is spelt resizable, not resizeable ?
17:20  alaing: ajpiano: oh i see. what I want to do is go through my tr and add them cache each row to specific variables that I can use later
17:20  Vorspire: alaing; var empty = $([]); empty = empty.add('#one').add('#two'); //Result: Length = 2, [#one, #two]
17:21  ajpiano: Vorspire, you can just do $() for empty jQobj
17:21  Vorspire: I felt uncomfortable without anything inside the ( ), dunno why but nice to know, thanks
17:21  dschuett: ajpiano: haha - yup, it sure is...thanks. - Is there a parameter that makes it fit to screen?
17:22  ajpiano: you had to do $([]) in < 1.4
17:22  alaing: lol i only figured $() was an empty jqobj when i console log it and it returns that when it cant find any selectors
17:23  Vorspire: I really like how you can take a native array and wrap it with the jQuery "ctor" to perform .each and stuff without having to write arbitrary iterators :)
17:23  dschuett: ajpiano: if i do a fullscreen=1 it takes away the menubar
17:24  ajpiano: Vorspire, you don' thave to wrap it with to iteate an aribtrary array, just use $.each(arr,fn);
17:25  Vorspire: ajpiano, I suppose so, I guess it's a matter of style, preferably I'd rather chose the less resource intense method which I guess would be $.each, since you don't have to initialize a new jQuery Object with the Array?
17:25  zakwilson: http://jsfiddle.net/Sm92g/ <-- stripped-down demo of the problem I'm having adding on to data I'm trying to post. I'm sure I'm just misusing the API, but it's a bit unclear to me what acceptable values are for data.
17:25  ajpiano: it's not a matter of style.
17:25  Hopsy: is it possible to see the original height/width of an image?
17:25  Hopsy: by useing jquery?
17:25  ajpiano: using $(array).each(fn) to iterate over a generic array is just wrong.
17:26  ajpiano: if it's an array of dom elements, that's a different story, but otherwise, it's wrong.
17:26  Vorspire: It's usually an array of DOM elements when I do it :P
17:26  Vorspire: otherwise I just use for( var i in arr)
17:26  Vorspire: well, for object iteration
17:26  ajpiano: yea, but that is a native behaviour of jQuery, that you can wrap a simple array of dom elements
17:27 --- jaiball is now known as jaiball_

17:27  sean`: normal arrays should be iterated using for (..), and if you can't contain yourself, at least use $.map (array, fn)

17:56  ajpiano: fl0at, km.widget.edVolGraph is a constructor, essentially?
17:56  fl0at: fixed. yes
17:56  ajpiano: you should use it like one
17:56  ajpiano: right now the way it's defined, you don't have separate instances
17:57  ajpiano: you just have one object
17:57  fl0at: how am i doing it wrong
17:59  ajpiano: each widget is not distinct from the other widgets
18:01  fl0at: ajpiano: so im just missing some fundamental js object understanding here.
18:02  fl0at: ajpiano: if I instantiate them properly I don't think I could solve the problem with unsubscribe still

18:04  timmywil: or parent
18:04  toastyghost: sry that was @u19809
18:04  u19809: thx
18:04  toastyghost: np
18:05  toastyghost: hm, which runs faster? closest or parent?
18:05  timmywil: depends on how many levels up you need to go
18:05  timmywil: if it's li > a, go with parent
18:05  toastyghost: also you might need to reverse the order of siblings.removeclass and addclass there, i don't remember if siblings returns the current element as part of the set
18:05  ajpiano: fl0at, i would say you should probably do it with more specific topic names
18:06  timmywil: it doesn't
18:06  toastyghost: ok cool nvm then
18:06  fl0at: ajpiano: yes, but it's just one file to fetch. perhaps i need to rethink the whole thing.

18:41 --- alaing_away is now known as alaing
18:42  JeffJassky: Hmm I just read something that says that the HTML parser sets a binding for the element.. and reading the "source code" of an onclick attribute might be impossible.
18:42  Kambfhase: $(elem).attr("onclick")
18:42  Kambfhase: tried that?
18:43  JeffJassky: right. it just returns "onclick(event)"
18:46 --- alaing is now known as alaing_away

18:57  NiftyLettuce: paul_irish: you included some sort of minify script in h5bp right?
18:57  johnathanb: I'm including jQuery 1.4.4 min up above and jquery.tmpl.js does exist

18:58  bsdnux: i have a list of links that load additional content using ajax. one link may be selected at a time. what i did is $('#linkdiv a').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active'); in the $('#linkdiv a').click event. ie: remove all occurences of active and set it on the newly selected one. however, the addClass is ignored (or overwritten by some racecondition?). when leaving away the removeClass call, the addClass call works.
18:59  ajpiano: bsdnux: $("#linkdiv a").not(this).removeClass("active") ?
19:00  paul_irish: NiftyLettuce: there is a full build script. you should try using it.
19:00  paul_irish: it uses yui compressor atm
19:00  bsdnux: ajpiano, same result

19:07  gnarf: what is that factoid with the nice ref to the html spec for ID?
19:07  ajpiano: ?w3c id error
19:07  bot-t: An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
19:07  gnarf: ?valid id
19:07  bot-t: ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time

20:08  serio: not everything is on grooveshark

20:12  thepacmanfan: fris: grooveshark has been around for a couple years now. not familiar with seeqpod.
20:13  fris: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeeqPod
20:14  Hopsy: for example [url]http://www.mypage.com/something?p=something[/url]
20:14  Hopsy: will change to <img src="http://www.mypage.com/something?p=something">
20:15  Hopsy: so it would execute something without ppl knows it =[
20:15  thepacmanfan: grooveshark appears to be doing enough things right business-wise that they will have to be forced out legally rather than financially... but i may be wrong.
20:15  Hopsy: serio: =[
20:16  serio: :/
20:16  Hopsy: gnarf then? :p
20:16  gnarf: Hopsy: pretty sure thats doable on most forums
20:17  gnarf: or rather [img] tags
20:17  gnarf: i used to have a forum signature php script that told people their IP
20:17  Hopsy: yes, but isnt there a simple solution for this?
20:17  Lumpio-: nope
20:17  gnarf: don't allow users to post images?
20:18  thepacmanfan: slightly related... there's an interesting image tearing bug in Firefox 3.
20:18  Lumpio-: Services that use GET for destructive actions deserve that anyways
20:18  Hopsy: gnarf: can i see the source of that signature?
20:19  Hopsy: did you put some executeable stuff in the meta tags?
20:19  gnarf: Hopsy: long long time ago, it basically was a createimagefromjpeg() and then write some text over my image
20:19  gnarf: no, <img src="http://gnarf.net/genmysig.php">
20:19  gnarf: or whatever it was
20:19  Hopsy: ah
20:19  thepacmanfan: if you do <img src="randomimage.php">, reload the page so the script provides a different images, Firefox doesn't redraw the old image until you scroll. so if you scroll partway and then go back, the image tears.
20:20  thepacmanfan: was not an issue in 3.5 branch, but it is in 3.6... go figure
20:20  gnarf: Lumpio- makes a good point about not using GET for actions that change/destroy things
20:20  Hopsy: hmm, a image have image headers right?
20:21  Hopsy: cant i just download the first 2 lines?
20:21  Hopsy: control the header
20:21  Lumpio-: That involves making the request.
20:21  Hopsy: and allow, or disable it
20:21  Lumpio-: You could always try a HEAD request but it's not guaranteed not to run stuff
20:21  gnarf: Hopsy: then your server needs to make a request for the image
20:21  gnarf: and that just slows shit down

22:06  erichynds: .add()

22:07  peter2: i can't figure out why this isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/qFhTk/
22:07 @ajpiano: gnarf you could .get().push()

22:45  gnarf: rather
22:45  Figaroo: ?
22:45 * mikeputnam facepalm
22:45  gnarf: function(indexInArray, valueOfElement)
22:45  mikeputnam: thank you
22:46  gnarf: what "string" are you trying to build
22:46  mikeputnam: i was thinking that the parameters of the function were related to the structure of the json
22:46  gnarf: cuz data.something.join(",") might be easier :)
22:47  gnarf: ?$.map([1,2,3], function(i, v) { return 'Value '+v;}).join(' -- ');
22:47  bot-t: gnarf, .css() - Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
22:47  gnarf: oops
22:47  gnarf: ?eval $.map([1,2,3], function(i, v) { return 'Value '+v;}).join(' -- ');
22:47  bot-t: gnarf: "Value 0 -- Value 1 -- Value 2"
22:47  gnarf: hrm
22:47  gnarf: map must take values in opposite order
22:47  erichynds: yeah, that is annoying
22:47  gnarf: thats kinda strange
22:48  gnarf: or rather "inconsistent"
22:48  gnarf: but i suppose it makes sense
22:48  gnarf: ?mdc map
22:48  bot-t: gnarf, map - Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
22:48  gnarf: ?mdc forEach

22:48 * mikeputnam takes gnarf out to dinner and a movie
22:48  mikeputnam: thanks a bunch!
22:48  explodes: Brodingo: FWIW it was the periods...
22:49  gnarf: forEach / map take things in the same order
22:49 @Brodingo: congrats
22:49  gnarf: mikeputnam: be careful, borris might return to call me an asshole if you're too nice to me
22:49  mikeputnam: :/
22:51  CFNinja: What happens if this $thisobj.closest("tr").find("input") doesn't encounter an input?
22:51  gnarf: you'll get an empty result CFNinja
22:51  cpgo: length = 0
22:51  CFNinja: oh! length.
22:52  CFNinja: I kept going to null and isdefined etc.
22:52  CFNinja: thanks
22:52  gmonnerat: hello all, Is possible get one div from url, but without load ?
22:52  gnarf: CFNinja: its better to return an empty result so you can continue chaining it
22:53  gmonnerat: i.e 'url div.my_tag' ?
22:53  CFNinja: ah. now that makes sense. thanks for the context.
22:55 @Brodingo: did i break it
22:55  sean`: yez
22:55  gnarf: gmonnerat: $.get('url', function(data) { $(data).find('div.my_tag'); }) ?
22:57  gnarf: anyone out there able to explain why map and each don't use the same callback parameter order?
22:57  gnarf: i would almost expect (value, index) for both but each is (index, value)
22:58 @ajpiano: no idea
22:58 @ajpiano: "Also, for some bizarre, cruel reason, the arguments to the function supplied jQuery.fn.map and jQuery.map are NOT consistent with each other. The function signature for effin’ map, the one on the jQuery prototype, is function(index,element), consistent with other iterating functions on the jQuery prototpye, whereas the generic jQuery.map’s signature is function(element,index), because of [REDACTED]."
22:58  sean`: gnarf, map expects an array as each can expect an object
22:58  sean`: on
22:58  sean`: that thing
22:59  sean`: seriously, no idea
22:59  toastyghost: i'd guess they were added by different developers at different times and there wasn't any protocol to follow on that
22:59  sean`: it bugs me too, but once you know it, it's done
22:59 @ajpiano: toastyghost, they weren't added  by different develoeprs
22:59  gnarf: i would imagine both were jresig in jQ 1.
22:59 @ajpiano: yep
22:59  gnarf: old enough core funcs
22:59  toastyghost: ah
23:00  gnarf: so .fn.map takes index, value
23:00  gnarf: crazy
23:00  gnarf: $.map is the lone wolf that complies with the mdc .map/.forEach :)
23:00 --- sean` is now known as Guest91554
23:01  Kambfhase: ich hope they'll correct this revers arguments in jQ 1.5
23:01  gnarf: i don't
23:01  gnarf: too many people relying on the broken way probably
23:01  gnarf: :)
23:01 --- Guest91554 is now known as sean`
23:01  gnarf: ajpiano: wheres that quote from?
23:02 @ajpiano: one of my blog posts
23:02 @ajpiano: :p
23:02  gnarf: does map call the callback in the context of the value?
23:02  sean`: ?source map: @ gnarf
23:02  gnarf: ?eval $.map([1],function() { return this });
23:02  bot-t: gnarf, Line#311 - "map: function( callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#311
23:02  bot-t: gnarf: [<global object>]
23:02  Kambfhase: It's not a bug, it's a feature
23:03  gnarf: nope, called in global context
23:04  gnarf: hrm
23:04  gnarf: http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#742
23:04  gnarf: someone explain the purpose of the concat.apply([], ret) ?
23:04  gnarf: as opposed to return ret
23:05 @ajpiano: it flattens any nested arrays
23:05  gnarf: ahhh
23:05 * gnarf sees the light
23:05  snover: gnarf: this is commented in the current jquery source
23:05 * gnarf read apply but thought call
23:05  snover: everyone makes that mistake
23:05 @ajpiano: snover, you pulled that ?
23:05 @ajpiano: <3
23:05  snover: which is why it has a comment now :)
23:05  snover: ajpiano: I thought John did?
23:06  gmonnerat: gnarf: thanks.. it works fine :)
23:06  snover: ajpiano: http://bot-t.com/jquery-git.js#742
23:06  snover: I can’t take credit, sadly
23:06 @ajpiano: oh he
23:06 @ajpiano: did one of those commits that makes rwaldron angry

23:14  u19809: hi all, when I click on my tab the previous div dissappears but the one that should become visible remains hidden, this because it still belongs to the class ui-tabs-hide.  Is that normal behavior ?
23:16  JKarsrud: Sure the id's match up?
23:19  JKarsrud: What's the recommended way to define modules in requireJS 0.2.1? require.def() or define()?
23:20  JKarsrud: Ahh, never mind
23:20  JKarsrud: Need to learn to read docs :P

23:22  qq99: in console it does indeed work
23:22  qq99: I have to redeclare it on line 75
23:22  qq99: where it is indeed a proper array of 6 objects
23:23  qq99: some kind of scoping issue, I figure
23:23 --- del is now known as add_
23:23  gnarf: qq99: not scoping
23:23  gnarf: you are looking for elements that don't yet exist in DOM
23:23  qq99: oh?
23:23  qq99: hmm
23:23  gnarf: try including the script as the last line of the body instead of in the head
23:23  gnarf: it will probably be there then...
23:23  qq99: is there a better solution than that?
23:23  gnarf: document ready
23:24  qq99: ah ok
23:24  gnarf: just like you did
23:24  qq99: makes sense now

23:46  gnarf: that googleapis link is solid though
23:46  soreau: gnarf: Why not use an official jquery file?
23:46  soreau: Unless you're hacking on it..
23:46  gnarf: soreau: they download the official one and host it
23:46  gnarf: so they know its official
23:46  soreau: gnarf: Yea but why host it?
23:46  gnarf: and don't use someone elses bandwidth
23:47  gnarf: soreau: the googleapis CDN hosted jQuery wasn't always around
23:47  soreau: I figured it would be an official standardized script or something
23:47  gnarf: there are different release versions too
23:47  gnarf: hosting your own means you are using the one you know you want to use
23:48  soreau: Ok, now I can actually make some buttons and play with this js code stuff

23:52  gnarf: soreau: thats not how you fiddle
23:52  soreau: I'm not sure how much code it needs ie. if it needs html <head> and <body>
23:52  gnarf: the <script> tag is implied
23:52  soreau: gnarf: Ah right
