00:41  Brodingo: pea[0] try $(this).siblings(".menu_header_left").toggleClass("menu_header_left_slide");
00:44  peepz: how do I select something with jquery
00:44  peepz: from a drop down select
00:45  Brodingo: ?val
00:45  bot-t: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
00:46  sean`: peepz, for real, you should know this by now
00:47  sean`: rtfm and learn a bit
00:47  pea[0]: Brodingo, thanks
00:47  Brodingo: yw
00:50  peepz: right thx :D
00:51  deoxxa: hey guys, i'm having a little trouble with the "submit" event on a form. it works fine the first time the user tries to submit the form, but then if the user attempts to do it again, the event doesn't fire and the form is submitted as normal (thus bypassing my pretty ajax stuff). do i need to reattach the event or something?
00:54  coldhead: are you reloading the form, deoxxa ?
00:55  deoxxa: coldhead: not that i know of?
00:55  deoxxa: http://gist.github.com/654616 << this is my code, by the way
00:56  deoxxa: it just seems that the event is detached after the first submission attempt
00:58  coldhead: deoxxa: i would try taking all that code out of the callback and replacing it with a simple alert('fired!'); return false;
00:58  deoxxa: good idea
00:58  coldhead: i would expect that alert to fire every time
00:59  deoxxa: hm yep, that works fine.
00:59  deoxxa: now time to find how how i'm breaking it :D
01:00  peepz: gents, I am targeting the change event of a selectbox and setting it's size to 1... this works fine in FF but not in IE6.. In IE6 it does not recognize what element that was selected.. I found a trick to to use http://pastebin.com/GumWZZwG .......my trick only works when I use alert!...wier
01:00  peepz: d
01:03  peepz: sean`:
01:04  peepz: :)
01:05  deoxxa: it appears that the append() operation is breaking the submit() event somehow :/
01:06  cppmonkey: hey everyone
01:07  snover: peepz: IE6 change event on select boxes with “multiple” option is busted
01:07  snover: peepz: Don’t think there is anything we can do about it
01:08 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
01:08  coldhead: deoxxa: inspect with firebug or your local equivalent, maybe you're busting the form?
01:09  cppmonkey: Im trying to read in an external script to a div section. is this at all possible without getting the file again? its a <script> section with a src. I know this seems like an odd thing to do, but I want to use it for WebGL Shaders an
01:12  eTiger13: whoa room lost almost a hundred people since i was last here
01:13  l4rk: out of 644 not really a big deal :-p
01:13  l4rk: well out of 700
01:14  peepz: snover: I am not using multiple
01:14  peepz: snover: My problem is that its not setting the selected element to the one clicked on when I change the size attribute to 1
01:18  w0tan: sorry for dropping a noob bomb, but i just started with jquery a week ago and am going insane trying to find the problem in these 10 lines i wrote. anyone mind guiding me in the right direction? http://pastebin.com/TT3KDrqS
01:19  ajpiano: try changing                         .attr("rel", "position: "inside") to .attr("rel","position:'inside'"")
01:20  ajpiano: try changing                         .attr("rel", "position: "inside") to .attr("rel","position:'inside'") even.
01:20  ajpiano: you have a mismatched number of quotes
01:20  snover: the syntax highlighting shows you your errors :)
01:20  ajpiano: you should be able to see that something is off cause the syntax highlighting is off
01:21  w0tan: oh :\
01:21  w0tan: .. that little thing to drive me crazy.
01:21  w0tan: thank you
01:21  int_64: hello...question about jquery ui component- according nav menu....how do you set thwe default menu to be opened first?
01:21  int_64: left alone, the first item is open
01:22  int_64: how can one make an arbitrary item be open?
01:22  int_64: accordian*
01:22  int_64: not according.
01:22  int_64: I think I still misspelled it, but you get the idea
01:23  ajpiano: int_64, see the "active" option
01:23  int_64: ah, thanks ajpiano
01:23  int_64: I jumped the gun a bit
01:23  ajpiano: yea you did
01:23  ajpiano: :p
01:23  int_64: :p
01:24  Hoe``: i need something to happen 1 second after the mouse moves over it, and not happen if the mouse moves out -- it's a tool tip, any ideas?
01:25  eTiger13: Hoe``: set a timeout with a flag
01:25  Tobbe: Hoe``: setTimeout on mouseenter, clearTimeout on mouseleave
01:25  Hoe``: thanks guys, I'll look into these :)
01:25  ajpiano: or use see ?dotimeout
01:25  bot-t: doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, it’s fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
01:28  amareus: Hello :)
01:28  amareus: $('tagname') returns all elements with said element tag
01:29  amareus: But how can I choose from the index?
01:29  Brodingo: ?eq
01:29  bot-t: .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
01:29  amareus: $('tagname')[3] maybe..
01:29  amareus: Oh thanks
01:30  Brodingo: using .get(index) or [index[ will return a dom element instead of a jquery object
01:31  cotycjc: can anyone offer some tips for use of jquery on http://displayinstyle.net/
01:34  Hoe``: cotycjc: what do you mean/need?
01:43  amareus: Brodingo, you mention eq, is it capable of finding the last value in the array values?
01:43  ajpiano: ?last
01:43  bot-t: .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
01:43  amareus: -1
01:43  amareus: ?
01:43  amareus: Oh I see
01:43  ajpiano: yep
01:43  ajpiano: -1will work
01:44  eTiger13: -1 will work
01:44  stoned: yo
01:44  ddaa: hi there
01:45  ddaa: I'm very confused by .find()
01:45  Brodingo: oh no
01:45  stoned: how come?
01:45  ajpiano: ddaa: hopefully you can .find() some illumination here
01:45  ajpiano: all it does is search all descendants of an element/set of elements for any elements that match a selector or pass a callback
01:45  ddaa: in my page, using the firebug console, $('form *') gives me the the expected, but $('form').find('*') gives me an empty list!
01:46  stoned: $("#ancestor").find("descendents");
01:46  amareus: ?count
01:46  bot-t: amareus, .length - The number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/length/
01:46  stoned: whats the big issue
