00:00  aro: has anyone used the jquery ui checkbox plugin?
00:00  _Madmartigan: so fucking useless
00:00  Down: wow, the site has a little engine that you can do examples, I downloaded the pdf before
00:00  _Madmartigan: i ALMOST paid them $50 for the little certification a long time ago
00:00  _Madmartigan: i think i used tizag.com or something as well
00:00  snover: aro: nope, nobody ever.
00:00  _Madmartigan: dont remember the name
00:02 --- Eric is now known as Guest58450
00:03  _Madmartigan: omg there is jquery certification on w3schools
00:04  _Madmartigan: only 95 dollars lol
00:05  jrockjiggz: theres a checkbox plugin?
00:05  dalela: wookiehangover, you got my paste?
00:07  wookiehangover: dalela: ya, gimme a minute
00:07  dalela: okay
00:07  wookiehangover: dalela: there's no js here
00:07  bradmaxs: does .serialize(); only work on form data?
00:08  wookiehangover: bradmaxs: yes, only for forms
00:08  Down: I feel like a good now that I can control params, omg I love javascript now
00:08 * Down can't spell god
00:08  wookiehangover: ? serialize @ bradmaxs
00:08  bot-t: bradmaxs, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
00:08  jrockjiggz: aro: i just use something like $('input:checkbox').attr('checked',true); -- this will check the selected boxes
00:08 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
00:09  bradmaxs: wookiehangover: thanks, trying to rewrite a script and learn at same time:)
00:09  dalela: wookiehangover, what do you mean? the js is not shown?
00:09  dalela: The JS is in the html at the bottom
00:09  dalela: It's just one line..
00:09  wookiehangover: dalela: you kinda missed the point of jsfiddle
00:10  Down: oh.. dude, can you loop a function and have a param be an array?
00:10  dalela: wookiehangover, sorry. Used it the first time
00:10  sean`: ?ud bpeg
00:10  bot-t: sean`, bpeg - boob picture like a jpeg
00:10  sean`: :)
00:10  sean`: enjoy
00:11  dalela: wookiehangover, should I reupload it?
00:12  snufft: i've currently got this, which tells me if what i'm mouseover-ing, is the particular element that i am after. is there a better way to write this in jquery? if($(this).attr('id') == 'our_story_begins_menu'){
00:13  coldhead: does this work for anyone? www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ilmarihe/metatunnel.html
00:13  jrockjiggz: coldhead No webGL content found
00:14  coldhead: i think it might be for chrome
00:14 * jrockjiggz firefox 3.6.1
00:14  coldhead: but i just get a flickering box
00:14  wookiehangover: nope
00:14  wookiehangover: not in 8.0.552.208 beta at least
00:14  coldhead: and not this awesome effect: http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=52777
00:14  coldhead: dang
00:14  coldhead: thanks for verifying, wookiehangover
00:15  Down: what is that coldhead?
00:17  wookiehangover: dalela: well first off you need to put the code you want to execute inside the doc ready
00:17  coldhead: it looks like it's supposed to be some exquisite 3d tunnel effect
00:17  wookiehangover: coldhead: liek dis http://js1k.com/demo/15
00:17  dalela: okay
00:18  dalela: but if I put the function in the docready, tje onclick does not work anymore (menuUp function not found)
00:18  coldhead: hey that's nice
00:19  coldhead: but the one i saw was fancier
00:19  coldhead: smoother
00:19  coldhead: blobbier
00:19  SugaSlide: talking bout boobs?
00:19  SugaSlide: o nvm...
00:19  bradmaxs: how can I make this: message = $(chatboxtextarea).val(); into this data[Model][field]?
00:19  coldhead: picture a birth canal lined with lactating breasts
00:19  coldhead: also you are on acid
00:20  SugaSlide: fancy, blobbier, smoother...
00:20  SugaSlide: bewbs lol
00:20  jrockjiggz: $(chatboxtextarea).data([Model][field], $(this).val());  ???
00:21  bradmaxs: jrockjiggz: thanks - I'll give ti a try.
00:21  wookiehangover: dalela: an element has to be either position relative or absolute to animate the 'top' property
00:21  dalela: it is relative, or not?
00:21  wookiehangover: its not
00:22  wookiehangover: dalela: http://www.jsfiddle.net/hxx34/
00:22  dalela: you are right, it works
00:22  dalela: thanks!
00:22  dalela: and how can I put my function into the document ready ?
00:22  dalela: If I put it in there it does not work anymore
00:24  wookiehangover: dalela: functions need to be invoked after they're defined
00:24  dalela: invoked? I dont know what this means. Do you have a link which describes this for me?
00:25  danheberden: ?d invoked
00:25  bot-t: danheberden, No results found for 'invoked'.
00:25  wookiehangover: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
00:25  danheberden: did you just post a w3schools link in here?
00:25  danheberden: ?w3schools
00:25  bot-t: http://oksoclap.com//whyw3schoolssucks
00:25  wookiehangover: ?101 @ dalela
00:25  bot-t: dalela, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
00:26  wookiehangover: then read this one once you're more comfortable http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/
00:27  dalela: ok thx
00:34  ragefuljoe: if I have two separate apps, what's the best way to combine them into one, and have a tab menu to swap from one to the other?
00:39  m0dmd: hey everyone
00:39  m0dmd: I have var content = $("#Editor").val(); but my $_POST is empty
00:39  m0dmd: #Editor is a textarea
00:40  m0dmd: I searched up .val() on textareas and from my findings, it should work.
00:40  m0dmd: Ideas
00:40  danheberden: m0dmd: yes, val works on text areas
00:41  m0dmd: this is weird then
00:41  m0dmd: danheberden can you just take a quick look at my script lines
00:41  m0dmd: http://pastebin.com/VYeKvrCr
00:42  m0dmd: And I have a <div id="result"></div> So I know my autosave.php is returning empty $_POST
00:42  danheberden: well you aren't sending it any variables
00:43  m0dmd: There is a mistake in my paste though, I have commented out var content
00:43  danheberden: it should be getting an EMPTY post
00:43  m0dmd: i was testing
00:43  danheberden: it doesn't return any post
00:43  danheberden: php doesn't do that
00:43  danheberden: but you never _use_ content
00:43  m0dmd: I pasted the new changes :)
00:43  danheberden: and is the text editor a mce?
00:43  danheberden: or just textarea
00:43  m0dmd: The var content still doesn't send
00:43  m0dmd: it's an MCE
00:43  danheberden: you have to udpate it first
00:44  danheberden: ckeditor has a plugin for it already
00:44  danheberden: not sure about tinymce's implementation
00:44  danheberden: you can look at it on their website
00:44  m0dmd: alright
00:44  m0dmd: thanx dan
00:47  bradmaxs: still having problems. I would like this: data: {to: chatboxtitle, message: message} which outputs - to: me, message: hey there -  to be data[Chat[to]: me  any ideas?
00:49  m0dmd: danheberden ahhh I remembered cuteeditor has javascript API functions to get the HTML
00:49  m0dmd: thank you very much man
00:50  danheberden: of course
00:51  dalela: is it possible to "clone" an existing div with the same position/height/width above the existing one?
01:03  Down: how can I $('  next line  #id next line ')  ?  thats not want I want to know for but how do you add more than one line like that?
01:06  rmurphey: Down: i'm not clear what you're asking, can you rephrase or show an example of what you're tyring to do that isn't working?
01:06  rmurphey: ?paste
01:06  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
01:07  Down: here, this is why I need it... http://jsbin.com/usepu5/edit
01:08  rmurphey: ?tmpl @ Down
01:08  bot-t: Down, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
01:08  rmurphey: Down: you want to use templating
01:08  rmurphey: you do not want to do what you are trying to do
01:08  Down: ok, let me see this
01:09  rmurphey: Down: http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
01:09  rmurphey: that's a better link
01:10  Down: so confusing, this will take awhile but I think you gave me the right answer, thanks rmurphey
01:10  rmurphey: basically, you don't want to be building html in javascript
01:10  rmurphey: i mean, you can
01:10  rmurphey: but much easier to use a templating solution
01:11  rmurphey: where you start with a string with some placeholders in it
01:11  rmurphey: and then combine that with the data that should be used to fill in the placeholders
01:11  rmurphey: (which is basically what the templating plugin lets you do)
01:12  Down: lol, I just discovered params and feel like a god, I've now been knocked down to village idiot again because what you just said is extremly confusing
01:13  m0dmd: danheberden ya there?
01:13  rmurphey: Down:
01:13  danheberden: ya, wresting git
01:13  Down: any my sentence structure/ sense of humor is a little embarassing as well
01:13  rmurphey: var templateString = 'Hello, ${name}';
01:13  rmurphey: $.tmpl(templateString, { "name" : "Down" });
01:13  m0dmd: dan already, i figured how to get the the html. But I had this script working on something different and returning a response
01:14  m0dmd: dan, i don't think it's sending the content via the post array
01:14  Down: hmm... so name would be replaced with down in the string?
01:14  rmurphey: yup
01:14  Down: oh, see, why the f aren't there any simple examples like that
01:15  rmurphey: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
01:15  m0dmd: danheberden updated http://pastebin.com/1waSgdFr
01:15  rmurphey: there are some there
01:15  danheberden: m0dmd: and?
01:15  m0dmd: danheberden I was using the .post with the editor after clicking submit. So I assume it's not submitting the POST vars :(
01:16  danheberden: also, i would put the create setTimeout thing-a-ma-jig in the result of the $.post
01:16  danheberden: so you don't get ajax requests gettin' all lumped up together
01:16  Down: well, your explanation was perfect but one thing, why can't you just do like you do in regular javascript and make variable = "line"  next line    . "line"   next line   ."third line"
01:16  m0dmd: ok
01:16  danheberden: m0dmd: so in firebug or chrome dev tools on your autosave script call you see no post vars?
01:17  danheberden: and you can't just throw content in there like that
01:17  danheberden: you need to name it
01:17  rmurphey: Down: you can't have line breaks inside quoted strings
01:17  rmurphey: which is what you ahve
01:17  danheberden: m0dmd: http://pastebin.com/aVUHTjsQ
01:17  Down: hmm... right, but can I put quotes around each line and a period at the begging to make them add togetehr?
01:18  m0dmd: i see them
01:18  Down: I thought I saw that once in javascript
01:18  rmurphey: Down: concatenation in js is done with + not .
01:18  rmurphey: but otherwise yes
01:18  rmurphey: but trust me
01:18  Down: oh, hmm... well let me try that again
01:18  rmurphey: you do *not* want this much html in your js like this
01:18  rmurphey: this is a maintenance disaster
01:18  m0dmd: rofl
01:19  danheberden: Down - you are talking to the ruler of good javascript design and architecture land, fyi
01:19  m0dmd: danheberden ok i see why this was not working and my other script was
01:19  m0dmd: danheberden that was awesome.
01:19  m0dmd: danheberden can you help me modify the timeout idea that you recommend, I'm not a guru :(
01:19  m0dmd: with js
01:19  Down: oh, really? cool, thanks for talking to one of your peasants
01:19 * Down grovel grovel
01:19  Down: = )
01:19  m0dmd: rofl yea dan is definitely hot stuff round here.
01:19  Down: anyways, alright but I'm not worried about search engines pickiing up my content
01:20  rmurphey: Down: nothing to do with search engines
01:20  m0dmd: thanx so much dan! this helped me understand how things work with jquery lots more
01:20  rmurphey: everything to do with how much you want to pay me later to fix it :)
01:20  Down: ?? then what else could go wrong?
01:20  Down: lol
01:20  Down: hopefully a few hundered thousand
01:20  danheberden: m0dmd: http://pastebin.com/NrmYABFH
01:20  rmurphey: i'm mostly saying that this is a pretty easy thing to do "right" from the get-go
01:21  rmurphey: using templates instead of concatenating strings in your js
01:21  danheberden: m0dmd: i wasn't talking about me
01:21  m0dmd: i am talking about you :) you r awesome
01:21  rmurphey: it will behoove you to learn about js templating
01:21  m0dmd: do you have a firm, do you except money for such good support man?
01:22  Down: alright rmurphey, I'll take it into consideration but honestly it sounds like a lot more work since I wanted my entire page to be made from javascript
01:22  rmurphey: and what part of $.tmpl isn't javascript?
01:22  Down: hmmm... the part where I leave in divs
01:22  Down: unless I'm not getting this
01:23  rmurphey: you're not :)
01:23  danheberden: m0dmd: consultant / independant
01:23  rmurphey: Down: do some homework on js templating
01:23  m0dmd: nice
01:23  rmurphey: aka client-side templating
01:23  Down: ok, promise I will
01:23  danheberden: if you want to show your support, feel free to donate :)
01:23  danheberden: ?donate
01:23  bot-t: want to help support the jQuery project? Donate at http://jquery.org/donate
01:23  m0dmd: yea man
01:23  m0dmd: let me know how man
01:23  danheberden: just did :D
01:23  rmurphey: Down: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template
01:23  m0dmd: oh via bot
01:23  rmurphey: there's another templating implementaiton
01:24  m0dmd: dan permission to pm, (not for support)
01:24  danheberden: sure
01:25  Down: lol, its overwhelming how little sense most of these tutorials make
01:26  Down: I'm going to study more on http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
01:26  Down: as soon as I get done making the site
01:27  rmurphey: Down: are you familiar with server-side templating?
01:27  rmurphey: like, here's a template, here's some data, put them together and get output?
01:27  Down: not at all
01:28  m0dmd: dan an issue with the timeout inside the .post is that I need it to autosave no matter what.
01:28  hobs: tutorials generally suck
01:28  rmurphey: in your case you could create a template for the image tags you're creating
01:28  hobs: I just read the docs as much as I can
01:28  rmurphey: the template would have placeholders for all of the things that change from one image to the next
01:28  rmurphey: and then you'd combine the template with, basically, the settings to use
01:28  danheberden: m0dmd: you might want to use $.ajax
01:28  m0dmd: danheberden or should i do something like .change() set a var and then the autosave will run automatically
01:28  rmurphey: and the output would be the html you wanted
01:28  danheberden: and call on error or complete
01:29  danheberden: m0dmd: ya, that would probably be better.. keep track of when you last saved instead
01:29  m0dmd: yes, i'll be returning the last update via timestamp
01:29  Down: rmurphey, I'm telling you bro, I'm just not there yet. Only started this whole scripting thing a few weeks ago (I've been at it 16 hours a day though) and what your saying makes no sense to me
01:29  danheberden: and then on change event if that time was more than whatever seconds go ahead and query the server again
01:29  danheberden: m0dmd: you can just keep it locally too
01:30  rmurphey: var imgTemplate = '<img src="${src}" alt="${alt}"/>'; $.tmpl(imgTemplate, { src : 'youtube.png', alt : 'YouTube' });
01:30  Down: OH
01:30  rmurphey: so all of those things you are creating a bunch of times in your js
01:30  rmurphey: you can create one template for all the similar things
01:30  rmurphey: and then pass in a different set of settings for each one you need
01:31  rmurphey: and boom, smaller, more maintainable clode
01:31  rmurphey: code, too
01:31  Down: wow, that sounds nifty
01:31  Down: thanks for the great example.. let me work with this
01:31  rmurphey: this isn't js so much as it's just the standard "don't repeat yourself"

01:54  mbugger: Hi im looking for an event trigger for any option in a select being clicked by a user. If I use change() the event dosen't fire if the option is already the default. Any way to get around this?
02:06  NET||abuse: so i've had greybox recomended to me for poping up a model form for a https form transaction,, what's peoples thoughts on that, as it doesn't seem to be a jquery plugin?
02:06  NET||abuse: model??? modal
02:07  wunderkin: maybe its a model modal
02:07  NET||abuse: :P heh,
02:08  aro: how could i go about doing a select all / select unread / select none from a list of checkboxes? whats the best way to check the state of a checkbox?
02:09  coldhead: ?modal
02:09  bot-t: There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
02:09  coldhead: you know modals are?
02:09  coldhead: OVERUSED
02:09  hobs: lol
02:09  hobs: I know im gonna laugh when coldhead gets warmed up
02:10 * coldhead keeps his cool head
02:11  coldhead: i do actually have a cold presently
02:11  coldhead: the irony is lost on me
02:11  NET||abuse: coldhead: so , i have a widget i load on a 3rd party website, when user clicks buy button, we are under agreement we won't take users away from main site. so i was just going to load a modal iframe to the secure page for the checkout form
02:12  NET||abuse: coldhead: would you look to do it another way?
02:13  coldhead: well the way i would do it is not to make such an agreement
02:14  coldhead: and i'd use the web like it was designed to be used
02:14  hobs: huehue
02:14  coldhead: but as it may be out of your hands :)
02:14  coldhead: yes, i'd probably do that
02:14  coldhead: although modals and iframes aren't really straightforward
02:14  coldhead: like people often expect the rest of the page to be grayed out
02:15  coldhead: and that's not gonna happen outside your iframe
02:15  NET||abuse: coldhead: ah, well see i already have jquery an my own jquery plugins loading in a quarantined anonymous function, so i can load my own modal dialog and it will grey out the page
02:16  coldhead: knock yourself out, champ
02:16  coldhead: rock it like a locket
02:16  NET||abuse: :P lol
02:16  coldhead: take it to town
02:16  coldhead: what are you selling?
02:16  coldhead: please don't say "testicle keyrings"
02:17  NET||abuse: coldhead: haha, nah, it's group buying scheme

02:27  _Madmartigan: i believe it stop at the first parent aro
02:27  snover: aro: the api documentation explains this.
02:28  aro: how do i select a parent like 12 nodes up?
02:28  _Madmartigan: probably u want to rethink what ur doing
02:28  _Madmartigan: it sounds dubious
02:29  _Madmartigan: but there are many ways to if u have to
02:29  snover: aro: The API documentation explains this…
02:29  _Madmartigan: docs.read();
02:29  aro: well we have some nested tables, and one of them has a checkbox that is matched on. i just wanted to uncheck it if the parent up like 12 levels doesnt match a certain class
02:29  aro: anyways
02:29  _Madmartigan: snover this is a place for help afaik
02:29  aro: ok
02:29  taitems: has anyone got time to help me with a jquery mobile changePage issue?
02:30  snover: _Madmartigan: It is indeed a place for help, but it’s not a human-powered version of the API documentation :)
02:30  _Madmartigan: spamming rtfm not neede3d if ppl are willing to help
02:30  _Madmartigan: but i know what u mean
02:30  aro: i have read the api on .parent() - and it has no use case applicable to my situation
02:31  aro: i think closest() is what i want, but not sure
02:32  snover: it is
02:32  aro: i just worry that it will match the following row instead of the previous
02:32  snover: that doesn’t make any sense. it functions vertically.
02:33  aro: .parents() is what i needed
02:33  aro: not parent()
02:33  snover: you’re almost certainly doing it wrong.
02:35  aro: seems to work fine for me
02:36  danheberden: pwwwnd
02:37  snover: If you are checking for *any* parent with a certain class you do not need to keep walking up the DOM once you find it
02:37  snover: that is wasteful
02:37  snover: but of course, a DOM with 12 levels doesn’t exactly sound well-architected either
02:37  danheberden: "but it works when i use a sledhammer to nail a finishing nail into the wall"
02:37  _Madmartigan: just use a wrapper and find the wrapper, then find the child u need
02:38  _Madmartigan: if its too complicated
02:38  _Madmartigan: that a stray span will break ur script looking up 8 parents

03:03  hwk2|1: so $ is defined
03:04  rmurphey: hwk2|1: so, we're presented with a dilemma: is it more likely that the console is lying to you, or that something is wrong with your code?
03:04  hwk2|1: http://carbonenergy.ro/ro/contact.html
03:04  hwk2|1: take a look
03:05  hwk2|1: script is in source code

03:05  rmurphey: contact.html:288Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
03:06  rmurphey: so, i'd start there
03:06  rmurphey: by removing the <br/> in the middle of your javascript
03:06  hwk2|1: uuuuh :)
03:06  hwk2|1: why didnt firefox complain?

03:07  hwk2|1: crap... must stop using dreamweaver
03:07  snover: hwk2|1: take a deep breath :)
03:08  rmurphey: i strongly suggest using an editor that will run jslint on your js every time you save it
03:08  hwk2|1: well if you looked over the source code could you suggest any improvements, besides using jquery validate plugin?
03:09  rmurphey: don't make the same selection more than once
03:09  rmurphey: you select $('#submitstats') repeatedly
03:09  rmurphey: fix your indentation
03:09  rmurphey:                     if ($("#telefon").val() == '') {
03:09  rmurphey: use $.trim to trim whitespace
03:10  rmurphey: then just test for truthiness
03:10  rmurphey:                          $("#email").css('border','1px solid #F00');
03:10  rmurphey: don't change css in js, use classes and css rules
03:10  rmurphey:                             $("#submitstats > p").html(errors.join("\n"));
03:10  hwk2|1: in this case it isnt possible and reliable solution
03:10  rmurphey: that isn't actually going to put line breaks in your errors
03:10  snover: it’s always possible.
03:10  hwk2|1: it does :)))))

03:11  hwk2|1: it adds a newline foreach <li>
03:11  rmurphey: if ($.trim($('#telefon').val())) { ...
03:11  rmurphey: hwk2|1: why do you need a newline between li's?
03:11  hwk2|1: :)
03:11  snover: all whitespace just gets coerced to a single 0x20 anyway
03:12  snover: unless you are using white-space: pre
03:12  hwk2|1: got used to readable xml
03:12 * hwk2|1 got server-side validation :)
03:12  rmurphey: ok but js is client-side
03:12  rmurphey: so there's no reason for whitespace between li's

03:12  hwk2|1: :)
03:12  snover: uhhh. what?

03:21  hwk2|1: serialize doesnt work
03:22  hwk2|1: $("#contactform").serialize()
03:22  hwk2|1: how do i debug that?
03:23  snover: First make sure your selector is valid. Then make sure there are actually inputs to serialize.
03:24  hwk2|1: http://carbonenergy.ro/ro/contact.html take a peak :)
03:24  hwk2|1: its all there
03:24  hwk2|1: $("#contactform input, textarea").attr("disabled", "disabled");
03:24  hwk2|1: does this interfere?
03:24 * hwk2|1 dont think so
03:26  snover: Disabled form elements are not serialized. Read the HTML 4.01 spec sometime. :)
03:27  hwk2|1: uuhhh :)
03:28  snover: or, hell, *any* of the HTML specs; they all say the same thing.
03:29  hwk2|1: THANKS A LOT!!!!

04:18  NET||abuse: ok, IE 8 doesn't like line 137 of http://dealsrv1.test.featured.ie/media/js/widget.js     it thinks siteid isn't set on the json,, ??
04:19  rmurphey: letterpress: thank you :) i plan to keep blogging and yayquerying -- just need a break from the speaking
04:19  NET||abuse: FF safari opera and chrome all accepts the siteid json
04:19  talented: $('element').children().hasClass('className')
04:19  letterpress: no thank you
04:19  Danny_Joris: talented: cool tnx
04:19  talented: might need to be more specific with the children() though
04:20  NET||abuse: anyone know why IE won't parse this json   (on the page it's   <script>{"siteid":"1"}</script>   )
04:20  letterpress: glad to hear it, but i mean at least put up a donate button, so those of us who've benefited from your volunteer work can give back.
04:20  Danny_Joris: talented: yeah, the tag is quite deep, that might be a performance issue then, no?

04:20  talented: how many children with that class?
04:21  wookiehangover: console.log(blah.siteid) <= 1

04:21  Danny_Joris: not sure 10, 15 max ?

04:22  wookiehangover: NET||abuse: ya it doesn't really work like that
04:22  NET||abuse: wookiehangover: It works in FF/Chrome/Opera etc.. to just run var siteid = $.parseJSON($('#idofscripttag').text());

04:24  bot-t: wookiehangover, Javascript and XHTML - http://javascript.about.com/library/blxhtml.htm
04:25  wookiehangover: but in general there's really no good reason to keep JSON in the dom not attached to a variable
04:26  wookiehangover: either attach it to a var or have it returned as a response from the server
04:26  NET||abuse: wookiehangover: so surround the json with /* <![CDATA[ */   to see if that works?
04:27  wookiehangover: yes
04:27  wookiehangover: but you should probably re-think what it is you're doing
04:28  Danny_Joris: Can you do this? $(this +'.classname') ?
04:29  NET||abuse: wookiehangover: ok, tried that /* Cdata */ wrapper,, no joy
04:29  NET||abuse: wookiehangover: infact that breaks FF and Chrome now :(
04:29  wookiehangover: yes, because IE wants it in a variable
04:30  NET||abuse: maybe i can just pass it in with a var for everything then. that's fine,, no big deal
04:30  NET||abuse: although, i'd have to do 2 script tags then?
04:30  NET||abuse: wookiehangover: one for the script src="widget.js" and the other to have the var siteid=siteid
04:30  NET||abuse: as inline javascript?

11:38  pixolin: hello. I'm not too firm with jQuery and just had an idea of a web page layout where I just would like to know, if this is possible with jQuery: I think of the Malsup Cycle Plugin, but want to have pictures cycle on hover only.
11:38  pixolin: I.e. as soon as user hovers over a stack of pictures, they start to shuffle.
11:39  pixolin: I guess that's more like a flash animation, but I would prefer to have this with jQuery.
11:39  RandomSort: thanks, JKarsrud

11:54  Cork: Noeble: just add an if case in the delegate, that checks if $(this).next().is(':visible') is true
11:54  Cork: if it is, don't do .show
11:54  pixolin: MadMaX_: I was hoping for an answer for another question and I'm afraid, my jQuery-knowledge is rather poor, but spontaneously I would think of  .hover -- if "within 15px of an alement" is related to the mouse pinter
11:55  pixolin: pointer
11:55  Cork: MadMaX_: you can't do that actaully, you need to either add another rapping element, or track mouse coordinats
11:55  Cork: rapping==wrapping
11:55  MadMaX_: oh
11:56  MadMaX_: ok
11:56  MadMaX_: I was hoping there was something like .distance()  ... you never know
11:56  Cork: MadMaX_: the dom doens't have the info, so js can't really solve it
11:57  MadMaX_: oh, I see

12:51  JKarsrud: mainiak: which IE version?
12:52  mainiak: JKarsrud, 8
12:52  JKarsrud: console.log the response then, and check it out in the developer tools
12:52  JKarsrud: To see if it looks the same in IE as in Fx
12:52  mainiak: JKarsrud, will try

13:30  pallet: doonie can you explain how you mean
13:30  doonie: .ratingkey_x
13:30  doonie: add the style you have in alert_style
13:30  doonie: save in css
13:30  doonie: then just use ?addclass to the #ratingkey

13:33  steevenz: @pallet: i think u must use .css() too fill the style at #somediv better than u write like that

13:51  alaing: how do i set a time out on an function say for example ajax request taking to long

13:52  temp01: alaing: ajax has a timeout option
13:52  steevenz: not official jquery i think
13:53  alaing: temp01 i know but i have to use a different ajax function bloody oracle application express
13:54  steevenz: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/timers
13:54  steevenz: set some timers
13:54  alaing: how would u do it in normal js terms
13:54  steevenz: when u call the function
13:54  steevenz: when reach then u set some errors dialog appear
13:54  Noeble: Question: is it posible to disable marking.. other words.. end user to mark text or element with the mouse cursor
13:55  steevenz: i think is the other way :D
13:56  alaing: thanks steevenz. I dont normally usign timeout how would you do it in js normally. at the moment when i do an ajax request and the network falls over then it hangs the browser
13:59  steevenz: @alaing: i have no idea bro.. ^^ cause i use ajax() from jquery to get the timeout..
13:59  steevenz: or maybe u can set an error on the engine
13:59  steevenz: what engine did u use?
13:59  steevenz: php or asp?
13:59  steevenz: or maybe java?
13:59  alaing: i wish
14:00  alaing: no it ORACLE Application Express which is like phpMyAdmin but for an oracle db
14:00  alaing: it server html pages dynamically like pphp
14:01  alaing: their latest version was the first version to include jquery
14:02  alaing: we managed to hook our pages to use jquery beofre its latest release and unfortuately we waiting to be upgraded as I thinkg the latest one will help with using $.ajax() instead of their own ajax api
14:05  pallet: is there a way to fire an event if a div is being .fadeout
14:09  alaing: fadeout has a calls back if thats what you after?
14:13  steevenz: @JKarsrud : i 've found the answer
14:13  steevenz: haha
14:14  steevenz: i close the select tag to early
14:14  JKarsrud: okay?
14:14  steevenz: yup
14:14  steevenz: at the original <select />
14:14  steevenz: it mus be <select>
14:15  pallet: alaing, can I PM
14:15  steevenz: @pallet what u want try to do with that.. we must get ur point first.. cause many ways to trigger
14:15  JKarsrud: steevenz: Aha, I didn't see it
14:15  steevenz: ya mee to bro
14:15  alaing: pallet: if you want
14:15  JKarsrud: "bro"
14:15  steevenz: sometimes codding is sucks..
14:16  steevenz: when got some small errors
14:16  JKarsrud: should have validated your code
14:16  steevenz: ya.. i disabled the html validator at my browser cause my laptop running very slow..
14:17  steevenz: it's cool to hang out at #jquery channel
14:17  JKarsrud: disabled the w3c validator too?
14:18  steevenz: long time not chat through mirc
14:18  steevenz: hehehe
14:18  creati29: can anyone tell me if its possible to simulate the click of a button using jquery, not just execute an click function?
14:19  steevenz: @creati29 : sorry doesn't understand ur point..
14:19  Cork: creati29: $('button').click()
14:19  steevenz: what u trying todo?
14:19  Cork: that will trigger a click event
14:19  steevenz: i think creati29 try to do something else beside that Cork
14:20  creati29: i'm trying to execute some server side stuff from the client side
14:20  Cork: creati29: but no, you can't ever fake things to the point that the browser doesn't know theres a difference
14:20  Cork: creati29: if you want to do things server side, that should be ajax
14:21  steevenz: $('selection-button').click(function() { $.post() or $.get() or $.load() });
14:21  steevenz: maybe like this?
14:21  Cork: creati29: but as i said, the browser it activly blocking your from some event facings
14:21  Cork: *faking
14:22  steevenz: @JKarsrud: what ur name bro? and asl?
14:23  Noeble: Cork: I managed to solve most question regarding the code u helped with before. I now added a second jsonget to get data related to each section and I want to populate each section with this data. Within each loop, I do a new jsonget and try to append that data. However, somethingg goes wrong. Can u see any obvious errors in the code?
14:23  Noeble: http://pastebin.se/202559
14:24  Noeble: fyi, I disalved the click events for now. They seem to work fine and arent needed at this time.
14:24  Cork: Noeble: ajax is async
14:25  Cork: your looks doesn't wait for the last line to be added untill it goes onto the next
14:25  Cork: looks==loops
14:25  Noeble: hmm
14:26 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
14:26  Noeble: I first append the primary TR.. and then I do the new jsonget.. and start looping that and want to append all conents.. before i go into the next loop
14:26  Noeble: hmm why doesnt it wait?:)
14:26  Cork: Noeble: ya, but that doesn't happen
14:27  Noeble: apparently it doesnt .. :(
14:27  Cork: the getJSON is async, that means the code doesn't wait for it to complete
14:27  Cork: Noeble: so more or less all your calls happen at the same time
14:27  Noeble: Cork: ok hmm.. so how do I solve this in a proper way?
14:28  Noeble: cuz thats how I normaly do it on the server side
14:28  Cork: Noeble: you need to replace the loop with a function loop, and call it to start the next iteration inside the getjson
14:29  Cork: $.getJSON(function() { function next(index) { test[index]; $.getJSON(function() { next(++index); }); }
14:29  Cork: opps
14:29  Cork: oh, wait it was correct XD
14:29  Noeble: hehe
14:30  Cork: except for the closing of the functions :s
14:30 * Cork gives it a second look just to make sure
14:30  steevenz: or maybe u can use http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/02/add-table-row-using-jquery-and.html

14:32  andrepadez: hi everyone
14:32  steevenz: @Noeble i read ur script i think ur script its wrong
14:33  andrepadez: i'm looking for some help with a sortable/draggable problem wutg IE, can anyone help me please?
14:33  Noeble: steevenz: that might be true, Iam very new to jquery. What seem to be wrong?
14:33 --- RTPMatt_ is now known as RTPMatt
14:34  steevenz: at the loops
14:34  Noeble: can u be a little more specific?
14:34  steevenz: what result did u get with that script?
14:35  Noeble: well first jsonget loop adds all tr's
14:35  Noeble: and then I get 3 added rows from the second jsonget at the bottom
14:35  steevenz: @andrepadez try use tablesorter if u want to use at table
14:36  Noeble: probably 3 at the end because the first jsonget generates 3 hits
14:36  steevenz: what array from the engine looks like?
14:36  steevenz: which u want to loop
14:37  Noeble: hmm think of it as grops. First json get I get the primary grps and the second jsonget I get group members
14:37  steevenz: it is generate 3 times?
14:37  Noeble: so for each group, I want to get the members and append them
14:38  andrepadez: can anyone please give me some help with a draggable/sortable problem please?
14:39  sean`: happy windows btw
14:39  sean`: totally forgot on saturday
14:39  steevenz: @andrepadez try use tablesorter if u want to use at table
14:39  andrepadez: that's not the problem, stevenz, i didn't see your first message
14:39  creati29: if i have a server side event and client side event both wired up to one button and i use e.preventDefault to override the server side from being initialised, but i use it at the end of my client side script
14:40  andrepadez: i see you're busy with noeble
14:40  creati29: is there a chance that the server side will initialise before the client side gets to the prevent default part of the script?
14:41  creati29: or will the client side always run through before the click event takes place on the server
14:41  steevenz: sorry all see u guys next time.. must working again at my projects
14:41  andrepadez: thanx steevenz
14:42  steevenz: no problem

14:42  steevenz: oya if u want to use some drag on the table
14:42  steevenz: u can also use tabledragndrop
14:42  steevenz: from isocra
14:43  andrepadez: thanx, but the problem is with nested ULs in IE
14:43  andrepadez: it works perfect in FF and Chrome
14:43  steevenz: what the problems appear?
14:43  andrepadez: http://www.andrepadez.com/admin/menus/mainmenu     can u have a look?
14:44  steevenz: cause at this time i working also.. something like that
14:44  jqp: i'm getting an unexpected lack of behavior in the first demo of http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/ -- i.e. the demo immediately after the text 'With the element initially shown, we can hide it slowly with the first click:'
14:44  jqp: after clicking 'Click here', nothing happens
14:44  jqp: same when clicking on the image itself
14:45  steevenz: @andrepadez
14:45  steevenz: is that using a ul?
14:45  steevenz: or a table?
14:45  andrepadez: UL
14:45  Noeble: Cork: does ur codesnippet replace all jsongets I have? or just the second one? cuz with ur code I now have 3, even tho I only need 2.
14:45  steevenz: and for the libray?
14:45  andrepadez: various actualy
14:45  andrepadez: what do u mean?
14:46  andrepadez: if u click on the arrow on the right of the LIs that have children
14:46  steevenz: let me have a look for a while at ur source code
14:46  andrepadez: you open the child UL
14:46  andrepadez: in the js file, it's the last section of the code
14:47  Cork: Noeble: that code snippet was only to show you how to do a loop if it needs to handle async calls
14:47  Cork: Noeble: its not meant to replace anything, only an example
14:47  andrepadez: starting with function EditMenu
14:47  Cork: Noeble: sorry that i can't be of much more help right now, but i need to focus on work a bit
14:48  creati29: can anyone advise me if i use a .click on a form submit button which is wired to some server side code behind, will my client side .click function be executed before the form submits to the server?
14:49  mainiak: JKarsrud, are you still here?
14:49  JKarsrud: mainiak ofc, always here
14:49  Noeble: Cork: np. Ur examples are prolly nice. Iam just to green in this to be able to understand em outside a concreet example
14:49  mainiak: ok
14:49 * steevenz off guys. see u all next time
14:49  mainiak: JKarsrud, I did console.log for xml output and maybe found reason
14:49  oodavid: is it legal to start an object property with + and - ?
14:49  jqp: is anyone else able to reproduce that seeming bug on slideToggle?
14:50  JKarsrud: mainiak: okay?
14:50  mainiak: in short - I have found nothing wrong with xml
14:51  mainiak: but maybe the reason is I am working with "dom" as string
14:51  RTPMatt: .click on the form submit will fire before the for is bubmitted, you probably want to use .submit on the from though, it will also fire before the form is submitted
14:51  jqp: creati29: yes, i'm pretty sure
14:51  RTPMatt: *form
14:51  creati29: i've found that using .submit on the form doesnt fire before the form is submitted
14:52  RTPMatt: it does fire before the form is submitted
14:52  mainiak: JKarsrud, I am not sure if it is caused by that, but $("selector", $(string_xml)).length gives me 0 always
14:52  RTPMatt: something else is wrong if it is nore firing before the form is submitted
14:53  ratrace: Hi all. I have a problem with jquery-ui tabs. I followed the docs to "hijax" links in ajax loaded tab content, and it works on first load, but the "load" event apparently does not fire in reloaded content.
14:53  Noeble: Cork: When you have a min over. Is it something like this? http://pastebin.se/202560
14:53  temp01: jqp: that's not a demo, that's just an image to show you what will happen after you click. scroll down to examples section to see demos
14:54  creati29: when using .submit over .click i've found that non of my client side is executing before the postback occurs
14:55  RTPMatt: are you making sure that your selector for your form is correct? so you are actually selecting the form?
14:56  creati29: yes because when its bound with a .click the client side is executing, what i want to be sure of is that the client side executes before the form submits, not at the same time as that would mean if i have a large amount of client side to process then i am constrained to the time before the postback occurs am i right?
14:57  Cork: Noeble: yes, that looks correct
14:57  Cork: btw, you could move mouseover to delegate too :)
14:58  Noeble: hehe
14:58  RTPMatt: the client side processing happens before the form is submitted, they can not happen at the same time, one hapens on the users computer one happens on the server.  if you attach to the .submit on the form it will fire before the form is submitted to the server.
14:58  Noeble: I will
14:58  Noeble: tho it doesnt work
14:58  Noeble: :P
14:58  Noeble: so cant be 100% correct
14:59  mainiak: JKarsrud, FF log - http://pastebin.com/R1ua8Jr4
15:00  Cork: Noeble: ah the call to next(0); is missing
15:00  Cork: Noeble: line 48
15:00  RTPMatt: http://api.jquery.com/submit/
15:00  Cork: Noeble: and yes, its my error
15:01  Noeble: ok next stupid question.. how do I make that call? is it like the .change call?
15:01  Cork: Noeble: ugg, that means you need to replace the outer each loop too
15:01  Noeble: oh noes
15:01  Noeble: =)
15:01  Cork: Noeble: do what call?
15:02  Noeble: 15:00 < Cork> Noeble: ah the call to next(0); is missing
15:02  Noeble: 15:00 < Cork> Noeble: line 48
15:02  Cork: "next();" :)
15:02  Cork: opps
15:02  Cork: "next(0);", that IS the command to run :)
15:02  Cork: its what starts the loop
15:02  Noeble: ok so next(++index); isnt correct
15:03  Cork: Noeble: it whats does the next iteration in the loop
15:03  creati29: sorry to keep asking virtually the same thing just trying to get clear, so if i have a client side event and server side event wired to the same button, lets say a .click event for each
15:03  creati29: are they run synchronously or asynchronously
15:03  Cork: Noeble: you need to check when you reash the end, i missed that too...
15:03  mainiak: JKarsrud, IE8 log - http://pastebin.com/AWAwiK8f
15:03  Cork: if(index > text.length) { return; }
15:04  Cork: Noeble: if(index > test.length) { return; }
15:04  RTPMatt: they run synchronously, first the client side one will happen, then, once it is doen the form will be submitted to the server, where the server will to its magic
15:05  RTPMatt: you can (as seen in the example seen on jquery site) prevent the form from even submitting to the server
15:06  Noeble: Cork: you lost me.. I think the fastest way to get rid of me is to edit my example to a working one.. but if u dont have time ill just try myself
15:07  Noeble: Cork: http://pastebin.se/202561
15:09  movi: i have an XML like this http://dl.dropbox.com/u/196370/data.xml and would like to search for a cluster using its name. I make it into a jquery object using var jObject = $(xmldata); and then try to search it using jObject.find("clustername[..]"); how do i write the selector ?
15:10  movi: alternatively, how can i splice one cluster out of all of them using the <clustername> value only ?
15:11  Cork: Noeble: something like this: http://jsbin.com/okije3/edit
15:12  Cork: Noeble: i'll be home in about an hour i should have more time to look at this for real if your around then :)
15:13  asdf2345: hello
15:14  asdf2345: can anyone tell me if it if possible to include an event listener in a function like function abcd() { $.()hover(); } ?
15:14  tom2strobl: $("#content .mid div").fadeOut().html(data).slideDown(500); Why is the data shown before it fades out?
15:14  chefid: do we have a default function called changeSlide() in jquery?
15:15  RTPMatt: asdf2345: is it is possile, the listeners will be attached when the function is executed
15:15  KeeperOfTheSoul_: when using the datepicker in IE 8, if a user clicks on a date a change event isn't raised for the input field
15:15  asdf2345: ok thanks
15:15  KeeperOfTheSoul_: is this a known problem or do you want an example?
15:16  asdf2345: i appreciate the quick answer
15:17  Noeble: Cork: yes I do, thc
15:17  Noeble: x
15:17  mainiak: anybody with partial dom (xml) as string in IE8 traversal experience?
15:20  erichynds: ?ask @ mainiak
15:20  bot-t: mainiak, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
15:21  cryptic-: hey i'm thinking about asking to ask a question, may i ask to ask?
15:21  erichynds: KeeperOfTheSoul, use the datepicker onSelect event? although I agree a change event would make sense there
15:23  tom2strobl: why is the data shown before it fades out? http://pastebin.com/uB0ThuhY
15:24  erichynds: tom2strobl, you need to use the callback function of fadeOut
15:24  pif: is there a way to do this without each() ?  $('#pricetable a[href^=?id_cabin_]').each(function() {  $(this).height($(this).closest('td').height()); });
15:24  tom2strobl: erichynds: I tried, with the same result. hold on a sec.
15:25  mainiak: erichynds, $(selector, string_xml).each() doesn't work in IE8
15:25  erichynds: mainiak, you can't feed XML to $() - it's technically not supported
15:25  erichynds: you have to convert it to an XML DOM first
15:26  mainiak: erichynds, you mean $dom = $(string_xml)
15:26  erichynds: mainiak, peep this http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/working-with-xml-jquery-and-javascript/
15:26  erichynds: no
15:26  adrian|laptop: when using serializeArray() to post a form's contents over ajax (using jQuery.ajax()), I've noticed I can't seem to append an array to the data to be posted. For one reason or another, firebug shows the array as being a string of integer values, delimited by a comma.
15:27  tom2strobl: erichynds: like this? http://pastebin.com/dA6Rp9aL still strange behaviour. slides down before it fades out
15:27  erichynds: wouldn't make sense to fadeOut, and then slideDown
15:27  mainiak: erichynds, maybe it is not supported, but somebody here one week ago told me this trick and it works
15:27  temp01: nice post erichynds
15:27  adrian|laptop: so, despite doing postData.push({name:'myAdditionalArray', value:arr}) to modify the data, prior to POSTing it, the value is not posted as an array... Does this make sense/ring a bell?
15:28  mainiak: erichynds, $(selector, $(string_xml)) works for me pretty well in FF, Chromium, Opera but not IE8
15:28  mainiak: erichynds, and only IE8 is my issue
15:28  erichynds: thx temp01
15:28  erichynds: what doesn't work about it?
15:28  _Madmartigan: do you guys ever have issues with firebug frezzing/crashing the browser?
15:28  erichynds: is it malformed?
15:28  _Madmartigan: freexing*
15:28  _Madmartigan: wow
15:28  erichynds: what does it look like when you inspect in firebug?
15:29  ratrace: I have a problem with jquery-ui tabs. I followed the docs to "hijax" links in ajax loaded tab content, and it works on first load, but the "load" event apparently does not fire in reloaded content.
15:29  KeeperOfTheSoul_: erichynds: possible, the only thing is I have a separate part of the script handling dirty tracking
15:29  _Madmartigan: its all good, but once in a while it just freezes up, even after i disable it
15:29  KeeperOfTheSoul_: erichynds: and chrome/firefox raise changed just fine
15:30  andrepadez: can anyone please give me some help with a draggable/sortable problem please?
15:30  mainiak: erichynds, $(selector, $(string_xml)).length gives 0 even I know, the element really exists
15:30  mainiak: andrepadez, whats your issue?
15:30  _Madmartigan: andre what
15:30  andrepadez: ok
15:30  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah sorry, it wasn't when you clicked that works fine, its when you tab to the next field whilst the date picker is showing, the change event isn't raised
15:30  andrepadez: so i have a ul inside an li inside a ul
15:31  andrepadez: and i want to do something like
15:31  temp01: mainiak: " $(“<html string>”) method only supports parsing HTML strings, but users often try to parse XML strings with it. This doesn’t work since jQuery uses the .innerHTML property for parsing and implicitly enforces HTML rules on the string. IE in particular will throw errors or misparse XML strings passed to $() in this way."
15:31  temp01: mainiak: from the article erichynds linked
15:31  temp01: note the last line
15:32  andrepadez: $('ul').sortable ({start: func{id=this.id}, cancel:'$('#id').parent().parent().parent()})
15:32  mainiak: temp01 - thanks
15:32  andrepadez: so when i am sorting a child ul it doesn't mess with the parent one
15:33  andrepadez: (this only happens in IE. FF and Chrome works just fine)
15:33  movi: i want to get a parent out of an xml by a string of its child. how would one do that ?
15:33  mainiak: erichynds, sorry for quick reading your article .. need to find new solution. yay! :-/
15:34  _Madmartigan: andre im not sure what youre after
15:34  _Madmartigan: are you looking for "containment"?
15:35  jomofcw: Hello =)
15:35  RTPMatt: hi
15:36  KeeperOfTheSoul_: here we go http://www.jsfiddle.net/gUc5c/4/ works in chrome, not IE 8
15:38  mainiak: question - there is XSLT way of selecting nodes - this also forces to treat tags as html?
15:38  KeeperOfTheSoul_: so anyone have an idea why, known problem? or shall I break out the debugger?
15:38  mainiak: KeeperOfTheSoul, srry - have own problems with IE8 :-/
15:39 --- kiu is now known as kube1987
15:39 --- kube1987 is now known as kiu
15:40  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: it shows the value in ie 8 after i tab to the next box, is that not the expected result?
15:42  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: it doesn't for me if the datepicker is visible when I tab
15:43  losing: Is there any reason using custom attributes (i.e. $('body').attr('foo', 'bar')) could be problematic?  Like are there any browsers which won't support this?
15:43  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: I don
15:43  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: i don't know, it works fine for me
15:43  jomofcw: Do you know any existing script which can do that : http://img72.imageshack.us/i/sheman.jpg/ each "square" is picture. The A picture is fix (at the middle of the zone) and I have n other picture to display around the A picture. Should render something like that : http://www.queticointernetmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/march08-friend-graph-facebo.jpg
15:44  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: so you click in the text box, the picker shows, you enter a date and hit tab (with the picker still showing) and value updates?
15:45  RTPMatt: yes, I have to tab out of the second box before the value shows up, but that is normal
15:45 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
15:45  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: tab out the second box before it shows?
15:45  RTPMatt: yes
15:46  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: and then it shows the date you entered against the first value?
15:47  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: Ah, my bad I was looking at the second value, you are correct, the date does not show
15:48  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: yeah, most odd, chrome and firefox work fine. IE 8 works if you click on a date in the picker, or when the picker is not visible
15:48  KeeperOfTheSoul_: but IE 8 doesn't work when the picker is visible
15:48  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: you probably should add an onSelect callback to the date picker
15:48  jomofcw: No idea :( ,
15:48  jomofcw: ?
15:48  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: that might do it
15:49  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: add an onselect callback and have that fire the change event?
15:50  KeeperOfTheSoul_: so on working browsers I'd just get 2 changed events, which isn't a big deal
15:51  RTPMatt: sorry, an onClose
15:51  RTPMatt: onClose: function(val) {$('#a2').text (val);}
15:52 --- |gat| is now known as gat
15:52  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: yeah, though in this case I'd probably do $('#a1').trigger ('change') or something
15:52  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: you could make it fire the .change, but then it will be firing twice, if that is not aproblem for you then i guess it is ok
15:52  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: its only used to update a dirty flag
15:53  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: trouble is the parts that handle the datepicker and the parts that look out for changes to inputs don't actually know about each other :)
15:53  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: it is probably fine
15:55  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: you should probably check out the sub/pub stuff
15:55  RTPMatt: http://www.command-tab.com/2008/12/04/jquery-fling/
15:55  RTPMatt: you can google it yourself, i was just trying to find a simple post about the idea
15:56  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: chears, I'll check that out
15:56  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: cool, good luck

16:18  gretagail: but it doesn't work

16:19  gretagail: yes

16:20  gretagail: So far all the examples I've come across have the template code within the main html file

16:20  gretagail: Unfortunately I can't find any examples of doing this
16:22  KeeperOfTheSoul_: gretagail: so <script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" src="something.tmpl"></script> doesn't work?

16:58  erichynds: fruitwerks, u sure jquery has been included correctly?
16:59  erichynds: also check that noConflict(true) hasn't been called somewhere
17:00  fruitwerks: would frames break it?
17:00  ||cw: you have to inlcude it on each frame

17:05  kenno: can somebody look and give some hints
17:05  Aliv3: i wish there was a way to punch windows in the face
17:06  [271828183e-8]: aliv3: use nix
17:06  Aliv3: nix?
17:06  [271828183e-8]: linux
17:07  Aliv3: lice treatment?
17:07  fruitwerks: lol
17:08  ||cw: fruitwerks: is #wm in one frame and the code in another?
17:08 * Aliv3 has tried win*,ubuntu, openSUSE
17:09  RTPMatt: kenno: your sample does not have any markup for it to actually run on
17:09  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: ah well, added a bug to the forums and see what response it gets
17:09  kenno: do i need to build that whole code?
17:10  Aliv3: i sorta like ubuntu
17:10  Aliv3: i havent got to try mac yet because it doesnt work in a virtual machine
17:10 --- tpratt_ is now known as tpratt
17:11  RTPMatt: KeeperOfTheSoul_: yeah, sounds like a bug, gotta love IE!
17:12  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RTPMatt: well in this case it should work, but something is causing focus to change so that _change_data is updated without raising the change event
17:15  Aliv3: how many ppl still use ie
17:15  sean`: Aliv3, around 400 million people
17:15  sean`: give or take a few million
17:15  sean`: or 10 million
17:15  sean`: or 100 million
17:16  Aliv3: how manyppl use other browsers
17:16  sean`: it's between 1 and 6 billion
17:16  sean`: uhm, I'd say that's the same estimate
17:16  Aliv3: i vote we kill the ie users, we dont need them, worlds over populated n e ways
17:16  sean`: between 1 (like literally 'one') and 6 billion would be the best estimate
17:16  sean`: Aliv3, do you have a mustache?
17:16  snover: that seems like one of the worse ideas I have heard
17:16  Echoes2: howdy folks, I am looking to create a 'slider' that moves content horizontally in a div.. I don't want to use the jquery ui widget though, any good clean examples you know of?
17:17  sean`: oh, picky
17:17  Aliv3: no
17:17 * Aliv3 shaves mustache
17:17  Aliv3: im onwe four
17:18  Cork[home]: Noeble: not sure this is what you intended, but its the only way i could make any sence out of the code http://pastebin.se/202564
17:20  Noeble: Cork[home]: lemme see
17:20  northband: Curious - is this appropriate for Rails/jQuery question?
17:21  Noeble: Cork[home]: it stops on th first round
17:21  ||cw: northband: more jquery, less rails, but sure
17:22  northband: I place a simple function on the page - works, place it in the application.js and it doesn't?  http://pastie.org/private/5vtci4gkym9tnbsupgnaw
17:22  Noeble: Cork[home]: what I want is to first populate the table with groups and then populate members to each group
17:22  northband: Load paths look correct and seem to be working as light box works fine.  So curious why this simple checkbox function won't work...
17:22  Aliv3: crap i broke it
17:22  Aliv3: ima have to rewrite my entire page
17:23  Noeble: Cork[home]: but I dont know the best way to do it.. first way didnt work cuz jsonget is async.. as u told me..
17:23  Aliv3: my html isnt even showing... wtf
17:23  Noeble: Cork[home]: so trying what ur showing now
17:23  seutje: can any1 tell me a quick and fool-proof way to wrap a textnode in an element without touching the textnode's child elements?
17:24  seutje: like <div>foo<span>bar</span></div>, how to wrap the "foo"?
17:24  Noeble: Cork[home]: debugger says that "pk" is undefined on row49, even tho it just used pk.id cuz first round worked
17:25  Cork[home]: pk??
17:25 * Cork[home] checks
17:25  pk4r: Hi there. A style question: How do you generally organize your jquery source code ? Are there any good guides on that ? I'm talking about splitting various parts of logic, UI etc.. For example I don't want the startup code which is responsible for setting up UI events reside in the same part as logic (data management) code.
17:26  Cork[home]: Noeble: do you have pk as a member of the description json?
17:26  Noeble: Cork[home]: in the second append I use y.pk, and it works.. but it fails when records from the first jsonget ends
17:26  Noeble: Cork[home]: as I said, y.pk works the first round.. but when first is over.. it fails
17:27  Noeble: its there when I watch the json table
17:28  Cork[home]: Noeble: a few specifications: should the second loop loop over the responces from the description call? (to give support for several rows per line)
17:29  Cork[home]: Noeble: if thats not the case the second loop is unnessesary
17:29  Noeble: hmm, in the first jsonget I get all groups, the second jsonget get members for each group
17:29  Noeble: therfer I send an id with the second json get
17:30  Cork[home]: uh...
17:31  Noeble: so I need tp append first group, and then append all emmbers to that group, and when thats done.. I append next group
17:31  Noeble: and so on
17:31  Noeble: thats the idea anyways
17:31  Cork[home]: Noeble: from what the code does: you get the list of groups, then loop over them and for each name make a call that returns its description
17:32  Cork[home]: if thats not what you intend, the code is wrong
17:32  Cork[home]: the extra question i made is: do you need to support multible rows of descriptions?
17:32  Noeble: then I dont think that is what I intend.. second call returns new entires related to the first member in the loop
17:33  ||cw: northband: is it application or Application?  a lot of web servers are case sensitive
17:33  northband: Sorry application.js
17:34  Cork[home]: Noeble:  you would have to pb an example of both the structures from the responce, cause code and what you ask for doesn't match up at all
17:34  ||cw: also if that's at the top of the page, the <a>'s may not exist yet.  best to put it in a $(document).ready()
17:34  Noeble: Cork[home]: ok, 1sec
17:35  northband: I think you may have solved it ... - let me try that.

17:44  danheberden: put it above it

17:53  Pinchiukas: Is there a way to take data from an ajax request that hasn't finished yet?
17:55  ||cw: Pinchiukas: I don't think even java script supports that
17:56  ||cw: you may be able to use a paging technique to return your data in chunks
17:56  Pinchiukas: With several XHRs?
17:56  ||cw: yeah
17:57  ||cw: I'm considering that for a project too
17:57  tapmodo: Pinchiukas: you can read data as it is received, if you work with an XHR object directly
17:57  tapmodo: at least, I have done that...
17:57  ||cw: if I find the data loads to slow, I plan on making a req for the first 30 rows then a 2nd req for the rest
17:57  Pinchiukas: tapmodo: any suggestions how to do that?
17:58  ||cw: first 30 would fill the screen and give them something to look at while the rest loads
17:58  Pinchiukas: :)
17:58  tapmodo: yes... let me find my code... just a second
17:58  fruitwerks: ok I'm a bit confused, I have an alert previous to this that gives me the correct val for tacos, but in my post data is says tacos, not the value - var tacos = $('#wm').val(); $('#uploadify').uploadifySettings('scriptData',  {[+params+],"wm": tacos});
17:59  KeeperOfTheSoul_: tapmodo: I didn't think that was supported cross-browser though (some will let you access it, others won't) ?
18:00  tapmodo: Pinchiukas: you have to set onreadstatechange property on the XHR object, then look for this.readyState == 3 (on the XHR object)
18:00  tapmodo: I don't know about cross-browser support though... that would have to be tested

18:01  danheberden: kenno - your problem is most likely data isn't available for some reason
18:01  danheberden: ie can't access that member of data, meaning what you're trying to access without checking first, isn't there

18:06  Cork[home]: Noeble: sorry missed the responce
18:07  fruitwerks: no ideas on my issue?
18:07  kenno: danheberden, you mean IE encodes data wrong?
18:07  danheberden: i mean your data might be malformed? hard to say
18:07  danheberden: try to break down your problem
18:08  the-erm: Simple question.  Can I have more than 1 $(document).ready(function() {});
18:08  kenno: im gonna try to give var data some static variables, without php
18:09  earthmeLon: yes, the-erm
18:09  the-erm: that is crazy.
18:10  the-erm: I figured it'd overwrite one of them.
18:10  earthmeLon: No, you're telling jquery to executing the encapsulated code once the document is ready.  Just like you can have multiple events for when another event is triggered (such as pressing a button)
18:11  fruitwerks: ok then, how can I decode some JSON, add something, and recode it?
18:11  Cork[home]: Noeble: if(indexDesc >= data.length) { should be if(indexDesc >= test.length) {
18:11  Cork[home]: Noeble: other then that, i can't see anything that should be wrong
18:14  kenno: IE still doesn't like that same line
18:14  kenno: even If I give statically those variables
18:15  earthmeLon: fruitwerks you going to use JS or PHP to encode the json?  What are you trying to do, actually?
18:15  kenno: is that line syntax correct: content = (data[jQuery(this).attr('rel')] == undefined) ? 'n/a' : data[jQuery(this).attr('rel')];
18:15  Blink7: hi all
18:15  Blink7: is there a way to check if the selected="selected" is actually in the HTML ?
18:16  Blink7: i know that i could just do option:selected, but i only want it to give a true in case there really is selected="selected" in the HTML
18:16  earthmeLon: Blink7 If you use Chrome, you will be able to check the source and even check the DOM on the fly by inspecting the page
18:16  Cork[home]: Blink7: $('[selected]')
18:16  earthmeLon: oh, I misunderstood :P
18:16  Blink7: Cork[home]: that's a new one, let's see
18:18  Blink7: Cork[home]: thanks, it works! is there any documentation on this?
18:19  Cork[home]: Blink7: its normal css
18:19  Cork[home]: its an attribute selector
18:19  Cork[home]: element[attribute=value]
18:19  Blink7: does this work in IE6 as well?
18:19  Cork[home]: ya
18:19  Blink7: great, thanks :)
18:19  Cork[home]: [selected] == *[selected]
18:20  Cork[home]: means any element with the attribute selected
18:20  Blink7: i did know of [attribute=value] but never saw [selected]
18:20  Blink7: yes
18:20  Blink7: or just #input_name [selected]
18:20  Blink7: it couldn't possibly be easier
18:20  Blink7: thanks again!
18:21  Cork[home]: Blink7: #input_name [selected] is not the same
18:21  Cork[home]: it should be #input_name[selected]
18:22  Blink7: Cork[home]: are you sure about that? if i don't type the space there it doesn't work, with space it works
18:22  Pinchiukas: tapmodo: after I access responseText, it disappears?
18:22  Pinchiukas: Or over time I'd have to deal with an increasingly large string.
18:22  Cork[home]: Blink7: if you have a space, it will select children of #input_name
18:23  Blink7: Cork[home]: my bad, i gave a bad example, i was using it with a #select
18:23  Cork[home]: ah
18:23  Tora_: Question, I am using jquery tools accordion, works great, but something overrides it later in the loading process.  Running drupal so there is a bunch  stuff, is there any better way of tracking down whats going on other than just manually digging with firefox?

18:50  PeterB: Is there an opposite of wrapInner()?
18:50  PeterB: like unwrap, but going down the dom tree to remove tags
18:53  pifantastic: kenno: content = data[$(this).attr('rel')] || 'n/a';

19:13  tesseracter: is there any speed benefits to ordering your selectors differently? $('#foo input:radio:checked') vs $('#foo input:checked:radio') for example?
19:13  danheberden: tesseracter: in that case, yes, because you'd filter by radio THEN by checked
19:14  danheberden: removing the need to find checkboxes
19:14  danheberden: though i would suggest input[type="radio"]:checked
19:14  danheberden: as that is a valid css selector, and would fire the browser's qSA which is faster
19:15  danheberden: try to move away from the custom selectors if you can
19:15  snover: [checked]
19:15  snover: not :checked

19:27  Aliv3: i made a <div class="form><input type="submit" class="submit" in="tools/shoutbox.php?mode=out2" done="map" out="#post" get="msg,method"></input></div>
19:28  sean`: Aliv3, you should use data-* attributes
19:28  Aliv3: $('.form .submit').click(function() { dtc = $(this).attr('done'); window[dtc](); }); is in an external doc
19:28  Aliv3: map is in the main document
19:29  Aliv3: data-* attributes???
19:29  Aliv3: what
19:29  Flam: K new version, i know it's getting the width attribute correctly, but it isn't setting it http://jsbin.com/ocuto5/3/edit
19:29  tom2strobl: its probably a quick one, but why do I already see the data before it slides up? http://pastebin.com/mSSPW5H4
19:30  Aliv3: ok i have a post when the page starts up, it calls map(); when the post is done, so that map will also effect the data that was posted
19:30  JKarsrud: tom2strobl: Hook us up with an example on jsfiddle, and wait more than 1 minute between each time you ask questions, plzlol
19:30  Aliv3: i want the map to effect the data after the jsform as well
19:31  tom2strobl: JKarsrud: sorry just thought its an easy typo or basic missunderstanding of mine
19:31  SeismicMike: might be the wrong place and if not, feel free to redirect me, but I'm trying to use Javascript MVC 3.0 to write an Adobe Air 1.5 app using Aptana. I've walked through a couple tutorials on writing air apps using aptana and am relatively familiar with that. I've also watched the video on jmvc 2.0 and skimmed the getting started guide. I think I have it working sort of... at least, when I visit the file in firefox, the JMVC stuff loads, but I'm gettin
19:31  SeismicMike: g an error from Air saying "Adobe AIR runtime security violation for JavaScript code in the application security sandbox (eval)" - this may be more of an air problem than a javascript problem, but idk if there's an air room in here or not.... Leastways, is this familiar to anyone?
19:31  JKarsrud: doesn't look like it tbh
19:32  JKarsrud: that was for tom2strobl
19:32  JKarsrud: SeismicMike: Sure you can use a library like jmvc in air apps?
19:33  SeismicMike: JKarsrud: thx. do you know what's causing this error though and what I can do about it?
19:33  Aliv3: http://pastebin.com/8EXXsfKt http://pastebin.com/FMjUinyV http://pastebin.com/ctbD5P3E
19:33  JKarsrud: SeismicMike: It was really a question, but I guess you've done everything this says: http://storytelling.concordia.ca/storiesmatter/?p=445 ?
19:34  Aliv3: seismike: there is indeed a ##air
19:34  Aliv3: :)
19:34  Aliv3: but its dead :(
19:35  SeismicMike: well I haven't followed that guide per se b/c I was mostly skimming it to see if anything related to this came up and I didn't see anything... also, he's using jmvc 1.5 and I'm using 3.0... don't know if that makes a difference
19:35  SeismicMike: I'll try following it though and see if anything comes to light.

19:42  JKarsrud: Well, that doesn't exactly work on jsfiddle
19:43 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 85 seconds
19:43  tom2strobl: JKarsrud: so you think its a lot more complicated?
19:43  JKarsrud: BUT! What if you trigger the event, with some the returned data as the event data, and bind to the event and fetch the data?
19:43  JKarsrud: sec

19:58  ignaciogiri: sean`: how
19:58  Ely2: h ihi
19:58  Ely2: hi hi
19:58  JKarsrud: Now maybe you could use ben's nice tiny pubub plugin, or phiggins pubsub plugin?
19:58  Cork[home]: ignaciogiri: you could do JQuery.parseJSON and wrap it in a try catch
19:59  JKarsrud: tom2strobl: but great that it worked :)
19:59  ignaciogiri: Cork[home]: but if I'm returning html it will parse the same?
19:59  ignaciogiri: Cork[home]: or it will return false?
19:59  Cork[home]: ignaciogiri: no it fill fails, as its invalid jspon

20:10  patbam: greetings earthlings
20:10  patbam: is there a way i can use $.getJSON to return an object instead of inserting into the DOM immediately in the callback? all the examples in the doc seem to show doing something immediately with `data`
20:10  notnotjosh: it's kind of hard to google for to turn up relevant results, but is there a selector to filter on data properties?
20:11  notnotjosh: along the lines of $(':data[foo=bar]')
20:12  Cork[home]: patbam: in short: no, ajax is async, so you need to use a callback
20:12  Cork[home]: patbam: that said, nothing prevents you from storing the responce in a global variable
20:12  patbam: Cork[home]: maybe i could do something like stick it on an object?
20:12  Cork[home]: sure
20:13  Noeble: Cork[home]: it started working before, it was that tony little error that messed it up.
20:13  patbam: Cork[home]: i see. what's the best practice there? $.fn comes to mind but it's for plugins... can i use jQuery's data function somehow
20:13  earthmeLon: I normally use $(document).ready but I need to wait for a js script to run before running my jquery.  The JS script loads/creates some DOM.  I have to wait for that script to finish before I attempt to modify the newly created DOM.  Any suggesetions?
20:14  Cork[home]: patbam: that depends what your needs are, you can create a global variable, or use window.<your variable> = dataM
20:14  Cork[home]: *data;
20:14  JKarsrud: patbam: how about this: var data = null; $.getJSON('someUrl', function(resp) { data = resp; }); ?
20:14  patbam: JKarsrud: hmm that's an interesting idea
20:15  Cork[home]: patbam: the responce is js data just like anything else, so it all depends where you want to store it
20:15  Cork[home]: patbam: not though, that you can't depend on data beeing set directly after the call to getJSON
20:15  Cork[home]: *note
20:16  Cork[home]: patbam: as its async, the code following the getJSON call will be run BEFORE the callback
20:16  patbam: Cork[home]: yeah i just noticed that
20:16  patbam: hmm.
20:16  Cork[home]: Noeble: ya i saw that before
20:16  JKarsrud: Not if you put in a call to a function inside the callback, mind you. So that's the way to go :)
20:16  Cork[home]: yup callbacks for the win
20:17  patbam: hmm i think i get it now
20:17  patbam: thanks guys
20:17  Noeble: Cork[home]: ok. Its 98% working now. Only thing that isnt working is when I do the click part. It only hides 1 "desc" row.. so if ther are 2 or more.. they still show
20:18  Noeble: which is wierd.. they should all hide.. but
20:18  Noeble: hmm
20:18  Cork[home]: Noeble: ya, as you add multible lines thats expected
20:18  kenno: i have a line:    return '<a class="menusublink" href="catid=' + namee.id + '">' + namee.name + '</a><br />';
20:18  kenno: it displays name well
20:18  kenno: but not id
20:18  Cork[home]: Noeble: you need to use nextUntill('.name') instead for next()
20:18  kenno: i think that syntax error
20:19  Noeble: Cork[home]: ok, trying
20:20  Cork[home]: kenno: no that line doesn't have a syntax error
20:21  kenno: href="catid=' + namee.id + '" this displays in source "?catid=%5C%27+++namee.id+++%5C%27"
20:21  JKarsrud: then you're not doing it right
20:22  kenno: but i got name from namee.name
20:22  kenno: and both name and id i have in data var
20:22  Cork[home]: kenno: that problem isn't with the variable
20:23  Cork[home]: kenno: do you have the function inside your html body?
20:23  Noeble: Cork[home]: This gives me syntax error: $(this)nextUntil('.name').slideUp(50);
20:23  Cork[home]: Noeble: forgot a dot
20:23  JKarsrud: $(this).nextUntil, nor $(this)nextUntil
20:23  KeeperOfTheSoul: kenno: why do your quotes start with " and end with ' ?
20:23  JKarsrud: Use a proper editor people!
20:23  Cork[home]: KeeperOfTheSoul: it builds an html string
20:23  JKarsrud: KeeperOfTheSoul: It doesn't
20:23  Cork[home]: but they do match
20:23  Kasreyn: vim! \o/

20:30  Cork[home]: kenno: where are you adding this function, you never answerd that
20:31  kenno: KeeperOfTheSoul, it is working, when i manually put the var data like: http://jsbin.com/ahobo3/7/edit
20:31  sac: make sure the draggable is not under your cursor blocking the mouseover
20:31  kenno: put when I use: var data = <?php echo json_encode($data); ?>;
20:31  kenno: then I cannot display id
20:31 --- mfer is now known as mfer-lunch
20:32  kenno: but i can display name though
20:32  Guest61673: how can i get my draggable div in front of my mouse cursor?
20:33  sac: Guest61673, http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-cursorAt
20:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: kenno: don't know about that function but should encode fine, so I'd take a look at your data php side
20:33  Guest61673: thanks, will try it :)
20:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: kenno: also, double check using firebug or the like, what the data is coming down as over the wire
20:34  kenno: http://pastebin.com/SZJPpPNk
20:34  kenno: php of that
20:34  sac: kenno, show the json_encode output of that
20:34  sac: $data
20:34  kenno: I used and thats exactly the same, as I manually put
20:35  sac: so it should work
20:35  sac: if it's exactly the same
20:35  sac: there is no magic
20:35  Cork[home]: the content of the json doesn't matte
20:35  Cork[home]: +r
20:36  Cork[home]: its something in the code that isn't escaped
20:36  ari5av: anyone with experience with the "tooltip" plugin?  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip  something's going wrong with $.fn.extend and I'm not sure what.  I think it's something I'm doing wrong
20:36  ari5av: this is the js: http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/jquery.tooltip.js
20:36  Cork[home]: kenno: try validate your code with w3c html validator and jslint
20:36  ari5av: I am not getting any javascript errors and I'm using it in the same way it's used in the demo, but mine's not working for some reason
20:36  sac: Cork[home], json_encode automatically escapes inside json properly
20:36  Cork[home]: kenno. cause something causes your code to get escaped
20:36  kenno: http://jsbin.com/ahobo3/8/edit
20:37  Cork[home]: sac: that doesn't matter, look at hte url he generated, it has %20, its the actually js code
20:37  kenno: i added the output of json_encode($data)
20:37  Cork[home]: it takes the js and pakes it into an url, so its not php thats at fault
20:37  Cork[home]: *makes
20:38  kenno: they are identical
20:38  kenno: you think html error?
20:38  Cork[home]: kenno: i supect something like unescaped html body inline script tags
20:39  Cork[home]: or something like that
20:39  hdon: hi all :) suppose someone tried this: (function($){var closureVariable={}; $(selector).bind('get-it', function(){return closureVariable})})(jQuery)

20:39  Cork[home]: causing the parser to escape your code causeing the js to generate something you don't expect
20:39  sean`: man
20:39  sean`: futurama sucks
20:40  JKarsrud: sean`: Orly?
20:40  Cork[home]: hdon: what is it your trying to do??
20:40  kenno: Cork[home], but when I manually output the data of json_encode($data), then I get id
20:40  sean`: yup
20:40  kenno: it is not very logical for me
20:41  Cork[home]: kenno: i've told you pleny of time, its NOT php its your html or js
20:41  sac: hdon, that should do what you're trying to do :P you're missing some ; but that's it and it should not even matter i suppose
20:41  Cork[home]: so json_encode doesn't matter
20:41  Cork[home]: kenno: your id isn't inserted cause your variable is added as text instead of its value
20:41  hdon: Cork[home], i have some data, and i want the DOM to be a view for the data. if i only react to events that fire on the DOM, then i am fine. but what if i want methods that aren't DOM-triggerable? how should i do it?
20:42  sac: hdon, if get-it event fires in $(selector), they'll do the meaningless function that just returns closureVariable :P
20:42  hdon: sac, well i'm calling trigger() to get "it", but i don't get "it" back i just get the jQuery result set
20:42  Cork[home]: hdon: custom events?
20:42  hdon: $(selector).trigger('get-it') doesn't return "it"
20:42  hdon: Cork[home], i don't know if jquery events provide me what i want. it seems they won't return "it"

20:43  hdon: wouldn't "it" just be available in the "meta" argument (if i had named my arguments) and not affect anything else?
20:43  sac: hdon, you don't want to trigger the event if you just want to call the function for each of those in the selector
20:44  hdon: sac, yeah i was just giving it as an example of a wrong way to do it that i hoped would convey what i want to do :)
20:44  sac: that was too meaningless i guess :P
20:44 * hdon thinks
20:45  Cork[home]: hdon: do you want to be able to pass data out to the caller of the trigger, is that what your looking for?
20:45  Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/EFhAt/3/ i want to sort the content inside the div but it doenstt work

20:46  hdon: Cork[home], ideally (at least i think) i want to be able to use jQuery selection to get at something that has an OOP feel to its interface. if i could somehow set an attribute on a DOM element that is a reference to a Javascript object that would work too, but i'm not sure that's reliable, i think my object just gets stringified before it's stored as a DOM element's attribute value
20:46  Cork[home]: ?.data @ hdon
20:46  bot-t: hdon, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

20:54  MadMaX_: I mean, I'll look it up
20:54  hdon: friskd, that's relatively easy to implement on your own
20:54  friskd: hmm..
20:54  friskd: ok.
20:55  friskd: i think im fried. then.
20:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: Cork[home]: the problem is, newer browsers arn't allowing you to access responseText before the request is complete
20:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: Cork[home]: which looking at the W3C spec seems like it is the designed behaviour
20:55  pfrog: that just seems stupid
20:55  Cork[home]: KeeperOfTheSoul: well newer browser do have sockets so...
20:55  Cork[home]: ?g websockets
20:55  bot-t: Cork[home], WebSockets - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets
20:56  pfrog: those don't work everywhere
20:56  KeeperOfTheSoul: pfrog: welcome to progress
20:56  pfrog: and besides
20:56  pfrog: I don't need two way
20:56  pfrog: I have a one way stream
20:56  pfrog: I don't need websockets, http does streaming just fine
20:57  Cork[home]: pfrog: well when things is usd in a why they weren't intended, this tend to happen, it gets blocked if its a problem and something new that is built for it is created
20:57  hdon: friskd, function set(root, path, value){path=path.split('.');if(!root.hasOwnProperty(path[0]))root[path[0]]=path.length==1?value:{};if(path.length>1)set(root[path[0]], path.slice(1).join('.'), value)}
20:57  friskd: hdon:  whats the best way to test if a json object has a given path? based on . notation?
20:57  hdon: friskd, that might contain errors or bugs, i just typed it in IRC to give you an idea
20:57  friskd: ok let me read that.
20:57 --- Guest61673 is now known as leon223
20:58  ||cw: pfrog: this isn't about http, it's about the browsers XHR implementation
20:58  friskd: hdon:  is hasOwnProperty a function
20:58  hdon: friskd, i know how you feel pursuing this though. i often wish javascript would embrace the arbitrary data graph and give us more powerful features for manipulating it :)
20:58  pfrog: which apparently is gimped
20:58  ||cw: by design
20:59  acidjazz: where doi change my status bar color?
20:59  leon223: i am using sortable on a list, is there any way to get the currently selected object (the object that is being dragged)?
20:59  Cork[home]: pfrog: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/eventedAjax
20:59  hdon: friskd, yes, all objects inherit Object.prototype. Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() checks to see if the object has a property by the name given as an immediate property. it excludes following the prototype chain, which is not excluded, for instance, when you look up hasOwnProperty with "obj.hasOwnProperty" :)
20:59  friskd: ok gotcha.
21:01  jcody: hey channel, smashing my head against the wall on a Mustache.js call that seems it should work. not sure if anyone has experience. I'm passing this object: http://d.pr/kPSi to this template: http://d.pr/6lQ3 -- it seems the code is not recognizing movieList at all, as it's just returning a blank string. ideas on where i could be going wrong?
21:01  hdon: friskd, if you find yourself working with ontological/hierarchical data graphs, you may want to check out E4X (XML extensions for ES/Javascript) and XPath
21:02  kenno: Can I ask a js question not related to jquery?
21:02  hdon: friskd, while limited to non-cyclical data graphs, you do get a lot of powerful querying options, and XML is a well supported data format :)
21:02  hdon: kenno, maybe. but you certainly cannot ask about asking :P
21:02  kenno: :) nice one
21:02  Cork[home]: kenno: ya, as its all pritty much js anyway (you might want to go to ##javascript if its really deep though)
21:03  friskd: ok. reading about that now hdon.  it sounds like it might really be relavent.
21:03  kenno: http://jsbin.com/ajoga4/3/edit  - this is div height 100% with js, working everywhere but older IE's
21:06  snover: kenno: That’s not jQuery.
21:06  kenno: is it possible to get it working in IE8 compatibility view aka in older IE's
21:06  Cork[home]: snover: lol that was stated from the start :)
21:07  earthmeLon: Anybody here using any of the jQuery mobile frameworks?
21:07  snover: I’m sure someone, somewhere does
21:07  hdon: kenno, that's really an HTML question
21:07  Cork[home]: kenno: you could try doing it with jquery, that might actually be simpler
21:07  Cork[home]: hdon: well more a css one
21:08  snover: Or with CSS
21:08  Cork[home]: it prob breaks on ie's broken box model
21:08  kenno: Im sure i want jquery or js for this one
21:09  kenno: Cork[home], can you change code there or give me an url to do so
21:09  Cork[home]: kenno: ya, but the reason it fails isn't cause of js, thats what we mean
21:09  Cork[home]: kenno: i don't have an ie to test on
21:09  Cork[home]: kenno: and when you have to fix ie, thats the only way
21:10  Cork[home]: (test it in every freeking version you care about=
21:10  Cork[home]: )
21:10  hdon: how many millions of work hours would be recouped without IE's existence?
21:10  Cork[home]: i'm so happy i'm out of that mosquito nest..
21:11  Cork[home]: hdon: i would prob have saved a year alone...
21:11  Cork[home]: i spent more then half my work day fiddeling with ie < 7 up to two years ago
21:12  Cork[home]: (and i dind't get any faund memorys thats for sure!)
21:12  kenno: but some people still use xp and IE6
21:13  kenno: and this js doesn't work in IE6
21:13  Cork[home]: kenno: so link them to chrome frame!
21:13  serio: Remember when IE6 was all you used for testing?
21:13  Cork[home]: ya
21:13  serio: cuz like, that was the only browser anybody cared about
21:13  Cork[home]: well no
21:13  serio: pre Firefox
21:13  Cork[home]: not ie6
21:13  Cork[home]: ie5 thtough
21:13  Cork[home]: *though
21:13  serio: yeah, I guess it was 5/5.5
21:14  Cork[home]: ie 5 what while ie was still pushing things forward
21:14  kenno: jquery works in IE6, am i right?
21:14  hdon: Cork[home], heh, yeah i'm glad i don't have to do that anymore. i'm doing web work now, but i've been told we don't need to support IE :D :D :D
21:14  Cork[home]: hdon: you lucky baster ;P
21:14  kenno: what kind of work is that hdon
21:14  kggle: Hi. i submit a form in a a href="javascript:$(form).submit();" i have also a event that process the submission (form validation) in this i make a return false; but the browser calls the href="javascript...". could anyone please help?
21:14  serio: kenno, yes
21:15  serio: of course it does.
21:15  Cork[home]: hdon: i have almost the same luck, but i need to support ie7 and 8 at a "it works" state :)
21:15  hdon: kenno, we run javascript on server and client side using Spidermonkey on the server. our clients are telephone companies and this project is web-based support platform
21:15  Cork[home]: hdon: so instead of 90% of my time it get 2-3 ^^
21:15  kenno: okay, I see
21:15  hdon: i want to implement the NodeJS API on our server platform :) but haven't had time to complete it
21:16  hdon: Cork[home], lol, "it works" can be a very subjective term :P
21:16  Cork[home]: hdon: it has to not break horrably
21:16  Cork[home]: but it doens't have to be fast or good looking
21:17 * hdon nods
21:17  Cork[home]: so it just barly have to work
21:17  kggle: i hope you understand what im mean
21:17  chovy: anyone used jQuery.template() ?
21:17 * Cork[home] has built a web os with jquery :)
21:18  hdon: kggle, instead of using href="Javascript:..." you should connect to the click event of the <a> element onDomReady with $(document).ready(function(){$('a or whatever').click(function(){...})})
21:19  hdon: kggle, you may also want to check out the jquery validate plugin which is designed to make form validation easy and uniform :)
21:19  Cork[home]: hdon: about notjs, we aim for go ourself :)
21:19  hdon: Cork[home], what is notjs?
21:19  Cork[home]: *nodejs
21:19  kggle: hdon, i use the validate plugin
21:20  hdon: kggle, :)
21:20  hdon: kggle, you could also use a submit button in your form and connect to the submit event of the form instead of using an <a>
21:20  kggle: hdon, but if i call the javascript:form.submit() in href, it always calls the href def after validating.
21:20  Cork[home]: hdon: its actually really nice, and so close to a script language its scary (even though its compiled you think about it as if it would be a script @_@
21:21  kggle: no, it has to be a "a" i will try the connect to a, thanks first ;)
21:21  hdon: kggle, the easy answer for you is to use javascript:void form.submit(). the void operator returns undefined after evaluating is operand, and browsers won't follow the undefined href. however as i said, you should probably not use an <a> at all for forms
21:21  creati29: I have an overlay which is triggered upon matching an if statement within a button click function, the overlay is created using Jquery TOOLS, can anyone tell me why the second time the button is clicked before page refresh the overlay will not load?
21:21  hdon: Cork[home], google is not giving me any love for "notjs" you got a link?
21:22  kggle: hdon, yes, but i have t use it for styling reasons etc. i would like to use a submit button for my self :d
21:22  Cork[home]: hdon: i corrected that one i meant nodejs not notjs and the language i talked about is "go"
21:23  hdon: kggle, ok, well i recommend that you set the href element to #. then in a script you should use $(document).ready(function(){$('select the a element').click(function(){/* do your form submit here */})})
21:23 --- snover is now known as snover|away
21:23  hdon: Cork[home], oh! i am huge fans of both :) when i first read about Go, i realized that someone had fulfilled my dream of duck-typing for a systems programming language, and they did it much more elegantly than my own thoughts about it had been :)
21:23  creati29: can anyone help me with my problem?
21:24  hdon: Cork[home], as i just mentioned i am working in my spare time to implement the NodeJS API on our javascript platform :)
21:24  kggle: hdon, ok i will give a try
21:24  hdon: creati29, only if your problem is not confusion about whether or not you can be helped
21:24  Cork[home]: hdon: :)
21:24  hdon: Cork[home], are you familiar with NarrativeJS?
21:24  creati29: did you read the problem as I described it?
21:24  Cork[home]: hdon: i recognize the name, but can't place it right now
21:25  Aliv3: guys ima try again ok?
21:26  Aliv3: i have external file with a post and inside the post it says if (dtc) { window[dtc](); }
21:26 * Cork[home] is almost asleep so don't count to much on him
21:26  Aliv3: but function dtc() is in the main document, not the external document
21:26  Aliv3: should dtc still be called or no?
21:26  hdon: Cork[home], it's basically Javascript but without all the "here's the next callback to call after this async action completes" nonsense. it rewrites your javascript to implement continuation passing without you ever needing to write it. at least in theory, in practice i have some qualms with it. i started work last night writing a javascript parser so i can try to copy the idea. i sort of want stackless javascript for all the async stuff y
21:26  hdon: ou have to do in it :)
21:26  creati29: heres a retype of the problem : I have an overlay which is triggered upon matching an if statement within a button click function, the overlay is created using Jquery TOOLS, can anyone tell me why the second time the button is clicked before page refresh the overlay will not load?
21:26  kggle: hdon, now it calls the pageurl/# but withouth the script, so the hole page is reloading, i dont know why this happens
21:26  mathi: hi
21:27  hdon: mathi, hi :)
21:27  Aliv3: mathi: hi:)
21:27  Cork[home]: Aliv3: what document its in doesn't matter, what matters is what scope its in (is it declared globaly?)
21:27  kenno: lol, $("#centerin").height($(document).height());
21:27  kenno: is all i need
21:27  hdon: kggle, in your click event handler, you need to call ev.preventDefault(); this prevents the browser's default action for the associated event. "ev" as i have named it is the first argument jquery gives to your click handler
21:27  mathi: hdon, hello
21:27  mathi: Aliv3, hi!
21:27  kggle: hdon, one sec, i will do a pasetbin ;)
21:28  Aliv3: oh yay it works now
21:28  hdon: kggle, check out jsfiddle.net some time :) it's a totally awesome pastebin for these kinds of things
21:28  Aliv3: now how do i automaticly scroll to the bottom
21:28  mathi: hdon, why not just "return false;" ?
21:28  Aliv3: $('body').scrollToBottom??
21:28  hdon: mathi, return false is not quite the same. there is a write up on it if someone would like to summon the irc bot
21:28  Aliv3: $('body').scroll('bottom'); ??
21:28  hdon: ?preventDefault
21:28  bot-t: event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
21:28  Cork[home]: Aliv3: document.scrollTop = document.height;
21:28  hdon: mathi, check that link from bot-t
21:29  kenno: hdon, jsfiddle.net is extremely slow  :/
21:29  snover|away: ?return false
21:29  bot-t: 'return false' or call event.preventDefault() to prevent the browser's default action (such as navigation on a link) in an event callback. Example: $("#link").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); /* code here */ }) or $("#link").click(function(){ /* code here */; return false });

21:29  kggle: hdon, thanks for the link!
21:29  hdon: kenno, i will check that out :)
21:29  kenno: snover, maybe, I used it only one time
21:29  hdon: kggle, also thank snover, he gave you the link i actually wanted you to get :)
21:30  snover: jsbin is unmaintaned.
21:30  hdon: oh it's not a link
21:30  hdon: just a summary
21:30  hdon: -and it doesn't actually explain it nvm
21:30  Aliv3: would $(document).scrollTop($(document).height()); work?
21:30  hdon: snover, what is the real writeup i wanted for return false vs. preventDefault()?
21:30  snover: return false calls preventDefault and stopPropagation
21:30  snover: it’s not a writeup, it’s 6 words

21:36  randomOfAmber: does dialog('open') not work in ie7? (as in this example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#animated)
21:36  hdon: ScottO_, i also get null if that's what you're getting. wrap a div around it and measure that.
21:37  ScottO_: hdon: no i get 19 in firefox and 426 in every other browser ive tried
21:37  ScottO_: hdon: what version are you using?
21:37  hdon: ScottO_, ah, well it's possible that for whatever reason, firefox is not looking up the property in a consistent way. i recommend just wrapping it in a div with zero border/margin/padding
21:37  friskd: hdon:  thank you so much!
21:37  hdon: ScottO_, 3.6

21:43 --- bowens is now known as tminos
21:44  hdon: kggle, ah ok. :)
21:44  kggle: hdon, yes i had this. the whole thing. and the reason was just a rendering of the code or whatever. on mouseover on link it just showd stage.com/# instead of stage.com/adas.php# don´t know why, i think from the messy system i update currently :D
21:45  kggle: i´m not new to this, but sometimes my head explodes :D
21:45  hdon: kggle, when the browser shows you what it thinks the <a> links to, it will show whatever the HREF is. you can override it by attaching to mouseover events and setting the status text of the browser, if you want
21:46  kggle: hdon, i mean the target url, in e.g. firefox on the browsers left bottom
21:46  hdon: kggle, yes, that is also what i'm talking about ("status text", i guess i mean "status bar" text)
21:47  hdon: bbiab
21:48  kggle: hdon, yes, but if i overwrite the status bar text the target will still be the same :) know i just prepend the current url to the # and it works

22:19  MadMaX_: I'm using .css({height:''+40 * size+'px',width:''+62 * size+'px'}) to set the size of all my elements and on opera, its perfect but it looks just a little off on Firefox and google chrome, any suggestions as to how I can set a different function if firefox is true or google chrome?
22:19  mmestnik: Hmm, I'm unable to discover how complete can be used for enforcing/suggesting a format.  It seams like I can pass it an array, but I need a call back to use.
22:19  kggle: _Madmartigan, whats your goal? to stay the sort in a current list?
22:19  _Madmartigan: yes, not allow items to go into sub lists
22:20  _Madmartigan: it will be 3 levels

22:27  _Madmartigan: still use it though (:

22:29  _Madmartigan: lovely, thx so much for the help
22:29  kggle: i would use a foreach with a class selector
22:30  _Madmartigan: as yes great

23:02  MadMaX_: magic dude, magic. Anyways, yeah, firefox and opera display my .css perfect but chrome requires me to make my certain elements, 25.5 px to be pixel perfect
23:02  Trisox: what color does the halve a pixel have
23:02  danheberden: MadMaX_: its probably the rounding calculation
23:02  MadMaX_: it changes, black and white
23:02  MadMaX_: na man, 26 doesn't work
23:02  danheberden: are you centering an odd-pixel element?
23:02  danheberden: MadMaX_: correct
23:02  Trisox: oh thats old school give it a color ;)
23:02  danheberden: ROUNDING
23:02  danheberden: division
23:02  danheberden: that kind of thing
23:03  MadMaX_: what I'm centering is pictures over pictures
23:03  danheberden: and are their widths odd or even
23:03  MadMaX_: oh, rounding = division?
23:03  danheberden: MadMaX_: like.. you have 25.5 / 2
23:03  MadMaX_: the widths are odd
23:03  danheberden: firefox will get a dif num than chrome
23:03  danheberden: MadMaX_: that's why
23:03  danheberden: ?eval 111 / 2
23:03  bot-t: danheberden: 55.5
23:04  MadMaX_: oh... cool
23:04  danheberden: so one browser goes one way
23:04  serio: Math.round people
23:04  serio: use it.
23:04  danheberden: the other, a different way

23:04  aro: why is that throwing an error
23:04  danheberden: make 'em even
23:04  danheberden: you'll be happy you did
23:04  serio: just wrap your math func with Math.round(), and you'll never get an odd number.
23:05  MadMaX_: I hate that I'm on a side project of a side project of one of many thigns I'm trying to accomplish, makes trying to get stuff perfect extremly stressful
23:05  MadMaX_: tedious

23:06  serio: OK!?

23:06  danheberden: gem css.js.php
23:06  serio: danheberden, yes, he should be using round numbers
23:07  danheberden: serio - SQUARE numbers
23:07  jaredhoyt: aro: cuz ie7 doesn't have the JSON object and i'm pretty sure the $.parseJSON uses JSON in the background
23:07  danheberden: and somehow needs the log function in there
23:07  danheberden: and Math.pow
23:07  jaredhoyt: aro: just check if JSON exists and use it otherwise eval()
23:07  aro: how do i do that
23:08  danheberden: jaredhoyt: or just use json2.js
23:08  danheberden: ?json2
23:08  bot-t: Douglas Crockford's standard JSON library - http://json.org/json2.js e.g. JSON.stringify(obj) and JSON.parse(jsonstr)
23:08  danheberden: and don't eval json
23:08  Trisox: is'nt there like jsonlint
23:08  serio: he is using json2
23:08  Trisox: or something
23:08  danheberden: return it in a closure

23:21  RTPMatt: Trisox: You need to set the value property on the select boxes, they have no value to be serialized

23:28  aro: how do i convert that string to a json object?
23:28  serio: see, not you're catching on
23:29  ||cw: b-lew: you could download their js files and decipher it
23:29  ||cw: they arne't even minified
23:29  b-lew: true I might do that
23:29  b-lew: http://www.thebeatles.com/js/pageloader.js -> ?
23:29  serio: aro, you use parse, at least that's the idea.
23:29  someguy00: well I now feel like sharing my newfound ...feature of IE :blisfull face:
23:30  someguy00: if you specify img {border-style: none;} the jquery .width() wont work properly, but if you specify img {border: none;} it works
23:30  someguy00: yaaay for 2 hours spent realizing this
23:30  someguy00:  ^_^
23:30  someguy00: :/
23:31  aro: parse is the only way? what about eval?
23:31 --- FrozenDan is now known as Ikamusuko
23:31  serio: eval is the oldschool way of doing it,
23:31  danisoftware: hello... I cannot make this json work. I tried for almost 2 days, no success. The goal is to load and change the values of input fields after an hyper link being clicked:
23:31  danisoftware: <script>
23:31  danisoftware: $(document).ready(function() {
23:31  danisoftware:        $('.editarcategorias').click(function(){
23:31  danisoftware: 		$.getJSON($(this).attr('href'), function(editarcategorias){
23:31  danisoftware: 			$("#tituloc").val(editarcategorias.titulo);
23:31  danisoftware: 			$("#ppaginac").val(editarcategorias.ppagina);
23:31  danisoftware: 		});
23:31  serio: dude
23:31  danisoftware: 	});
23:31  danisoftware: });
23:31  danisoftware: </script>
23:31  danisoftware: (...somewhere inside the rest of the HTML ):
23:31  danisoftware: <!-- $row['id']=integer -->
23:31  aro: what in the blue hell
23:31  danisoftware: (...)<a class=\"editarcategorias\" href=\"adminget.php?id=".$row['id']."&categorias=editar\" title=\"Editar Categoria\" ><img src=\"../graficos/editar.png\" alt=\"Editar\" /></a>(...)

23:42  darcyclarke: aro this sounds like a job for jsfiddle.net post the code your trying to run there and it may help understand why it's "not parsing in IE but is in FF"
23:42  aro: im going home
23:42  danheberden: ie IS an error

23:44 @coldhead: guys i'm cybering Trisox
23:44  danheberden:   /msg coldhead Trisox
23:45  kenno: but serio
23:45  danheberden: serio usly
23:45  kenno: how can I add click to mouseout http://api.jquery.com/live/#multiple-events in this example
23:45  _Madmartigan: any way to serialize non-form elements? using ids as values and order as keys?
23:46  serio: add click to mouseout?
23:46  _Madmartigan: for example, a UL - get the order of LIs and their IDs
23:47  SugaSlide: sup
23:47  kenno: I want same thing happen if I mouseout or click
23:47  Trisox: ?
23:47  Trisox: cybering ! hehe
23:47  danisoftware: the ideia is: I have a hyperlik to the PHP script that produces JSON; the jquery function should transform the JSON results and populate the input fields...
23:47  kenno: And I want to put it in the same function
23:47  SugaSlide: bind("click, mouseOut",function
23:47  danheberden: i wanna see something happen when i take that blue pill
23:47  danisoftware: the back slashes are no problem
23:47 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:47  danheberden: SugaSlide: events are space, not comma
23:47  Trisox: _Madmartigan i love to know that 2
23:48  _Madmartigan: something like what the sortable plugin does...
23:48  SugaSlide: danheberden ye realised after pressing enter
23:48  _Madmartigan: but on non-sortable element
23:48  danheberden: SugaSlide: i think i do that every time too
23:48  kenno: Can I do $('.hoverme').live('mouseover mouseout click', function(event) {  AND THEN  if (event.type == 'mouseover') {
23:48  kenno: then else gives me mouseout and click both
23:49  kenno: ?
23:49  serio: kenno: http://jsfiddle.net/8jg5m/
23:49  serio: YES
23:49 --- c4rl-afk is now known as c4rl
23:49  SugaSlide: yes... but not too sure why you would want to do it like that lols
23:49  serio: it makes sense if you want to perform the same action for two seperate events
23:49  serio: and keep your code DRY
23:50  kenno: thanks!
23:51  kenno: but serio
23:51  kenno: here http://jsbin.com/eluna3/9/edit
23:51  kenno: i have the (e) to
23:51  kenno: but in this example I have (event)
23:51  kenno: how to put them both there or smth?
23:52  serio: kenno, you really don't get it do you?
23:52  serio: function( e )
23:52  serio: e
23:52  kenno: oh
23:52  kenno: damn im stupid
23:52  serio: it could be function( wowawesome )
23:52  serio: and then if wowawesome.type == 'click'
23:52  kenno: I forgot that
23:52  kenno: :) no hard feelings?
23:53  serio: none whatsoever
23:55  danisoftware: can anyone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/Lyfr9/
23:56  Lumpio-: You might want to return false
23:57  danisoftware: where?
23:57  FatGuyLaughing: I have an HTML form that has a set of two fields. These field get generated 20 times each. Each field has and id with it's associated number. So client-number-X and client-name-X. I would like to change the client-name-X field base on the value of client-number-X. So far that's not an issue. I'm trying to NOT have to write this snippet of jquery twenty times, instead loop through it. Don't know
23:57  FatGuyLaughing: if this makes sense.
