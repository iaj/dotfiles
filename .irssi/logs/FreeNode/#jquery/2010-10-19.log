00:00  sbryant_work: ?
00:00  sbryant_work: I guess I can try upgrading
00:00  ajpiano: $(ui).remove() makes no sense, i promise you that
00:01  losing: lol
00:01  ajpiano: sbryant_work what you're looking for is close:function() { $(this).dialog("destroy").remove();  }
00:01  ajpiano: not that querying the dom by aria attribute isn't an AWESOME idea
00:01  sbryant_work: ;_;
00:01  sbryant_work: it was really a last resotr
00:01  sbryant_work: resort*
00:02  ajpiano: but that's why the destroy method is there
00:02  ajpiano: to clean up
00:02  ajpiano: so you don't have to do shit like that
00:02  sbryant_work: perfect reasonable, I don't know how I even missed it
00:02  sbryant_work: perfectly reasonable event
00:03  sbryant_work: ajpiano: try not to be too hard, this is my first time doing much of anything with jQuery UI
00:03  sbryant_work: o.O
00:03  sbryant_work: my typing today is really off.
00:04  ajpiano: so is your estimation of how hard i am ;)
00:04  sbryant_work: changing the close handler didn't do anything :(
00:04  sbryant_work: ajpiano: good to know!
00:04  ajpiano: hold on
00:04  thisoneguy2010: http://ghnexussix.dynamicwebcasting.net/index.thisone.html  dialog good in IE, bad in FF and chrome.  anyone have any suggestions?  I've stripped just about everything out of it
00:04  RingZer0: I am sure I am getting a jquery error here.
00:04  ajpiano: wait, are you saying you have events bound to things that are INSIDE of the dialog??
00:04  ajpiano: sbryant_work ^^
00:04  sbryant_work: ajpiano: no
00:05  ajpiano: remind me again what the prolem is
00:05  RingZer0: I have found a post about the error I am experiencing here: http://plugins.jquery.com/node/15666
00:05  sbryant_work: ajpiano: method is what's called to open a dialog
00:05  RingZer0: My error: $.fn.ajaxForm.optionHash is undefined
00:05  RingZer0: http://www.test.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.form.js?ver=2.02m
00:05  RingZer0: Line 1
00:05  sbryant_work: grrr
00:05  ajpiano: sbryant_work: what
00:05  sbryant_work: hold on let me actually explain the problem
00:05  ajpiano: no please, random stitches of unintelligibility are great too
00:06  Phrogz: *snicker*
00:06  RingZer0: Basically I am attempting to use jquery multifile plugin with the ajaxform plugin.  I googled the error and found that page on top.  Any ideas on how to modify one of the plugins to stop them from not liking eachother?
00:06  sbryant_work: ajpiano: I have an input button element, that calls the manageEvents method to open a dialog. When I click the button, the dialog opens. When I close the dialog and try to click the button again, the dialog never opens. the open handler never gets called and no exceptions are raised.
00:07  ajpiano: sbryant_work: are you really trying to call dialog on something ,and then when it opens, you try to load the content of another page into that someting, and then you look inside of that something, to find another element with the exact same id as the original something, and then call tabs on that???
00:08  sbryant_work: ajpiano: woops, no not at all. that's actually a typo. I was in the middle of rearranging code ;)
00:08  ajpiano: basically, your open call back leaves a lot to be desired from a ... logical standpoint
00:08  Bertrand`: I have to create a draggable psudo modal, any thoughts?
00:08  sbryant_work: oh, I understand your reason for pause.
00:08 --- losing is now known as pifantastic
00:09  eTiger13: ah good. I was just going to ask where 1.4.3 was and i see jquery.com was updated today to show 1.4.3 is the latest
00:10  sbryant_work: ajpiano: what's your suggestion?
00:10  RingZer0: as soon as .MultiFile() and .ajaxForm() are both called on the same form I receive that error
00:10  entr: what's new on 1.4.3
00:11  RingZer0: ?changelog
00:11  bot-t: RingZer0, UI/Changelog/1.6 - What was originally planned as the 1.6 release was moved over to the 1.7 release. The final 1.6 release is 1.6rc2 plus fixes. This is a legacy compatibility release for those still using jQuery 1.2.6. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Changelog/1.6
00:11  mathi_: I call .click() on an unchecked checkbox element, and in the callback function, it says that it is unchecked, I expected it to be checked ...
00:11  ajpiano: sbryant_work: how am i meant to have a suggestion, i ahven't seen the thing fail, and i'm really confused about the flow
00:11  ajpiano: without a live demo or something it's pretty hard for me to diagnose tbh
00:12  ajpiano: oh wait
00:12  ajpiano: i know what the problem is dude
00:12  ajpiano: if you REMOVE the dialog
00:12  ajpiano: and you're using a static ID
00:12  RingZer0: where is that live test site?
00:12  ajpiano: how the hell are you meant to reselect it.... sbryant_work
00:12  mathi_: when I manually click on the unchecked checkbox, it says that it is checked, like I expected
00:12  ajpiano: $("#foo").remove() ... $("#foo").length == 0
00:12  RingZer0: where you can copy html/js-includes, etc.
00:12  ajpiano: ?ldoidh @ RingZer0
00:12  bot-t: RingZer0, Live Demo Or It Didn't Happen - http://jsfiddle.net - http://pastebin.me - http://jsbin.com
00:13  entr: .click triggers only manually assigned events
00:13  thisoneguy2010: can javascript write to the top of the document before its read by the browser?
00:13  RingZer0: jsfiddle!
00:13  RingZer0: great.
00:13  mathi_: entr, what ?
00:13  eTiger13: mathi_:  you have to manually tell it to be checked on .click events
00:13  mathi_: omg
00:13  mathi_: i'll try that
00:13  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: why?
00:13  ajpiano: thisoneguy2010, javascript can't really do anything until the javascript itself is read by the browser, which typically is after the top of the document itself is parsed
00:13  pifantastic: sbryant_work: use $(this).dialog("close") or $(this).dialog("destroy"), dont use $(this).remove();
00:14  thisoneguy2010: what if the javscript is at the top of the document and would in theory be read first?
00:14  ajpiano: sbryant_work, yeah, do what pifantastic sez... use $(this).dialog("destroy") only ... or really sbryant_work, what you should do is int the dialog ONCE and then use the open and close events to close and open it
00:14  mathi_: this doesn't work correctly :
00:14  mathi_: $('tr.dayTr').last().find("input.allDay").attr('checked', true).click();
00:14  ajpiano: thisoneguy2010: that's technically not where your js is supposed to go
00:15  ajpiano: ?xy problem @ thisoneguy2010
00:15  bot-t: thisoneguy2010, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
00:15  mathi_: the callback is called, but says it is unchecked
00:15  sbryant_work: ajpiano: thanks, that's what I tried to do !
00:15  mathi_: uhm no, it says it is checked, sorry
00:15  sbryant_work: ajpiano: but this is an attempt at a workaround because that wasn't working
00:15  thisoneguy2010: this is problem X
00:15  Phrogz: mathi_: Do you realize that .attr() changes the checked state?
00:15  thisoneguy2010: http://ghnexussix.dynamicwebcasting.net/index.thisone.html  dialog good in IE, bad in FF and chrome.  anyone have any suggestions?  I've stripped just about everything out of it
00:15  mathi_: but the checkbox is unchecked in the interface
00:15  ajpiano: sbryant_work: that probably wasn't working cause you weren't doing it right
00:15  thisoneguy2010: taking out the doctype makes it work in FF for some reason
00:15  sbryant_work: ajpiano: bingo.
00:16  sbryant_work: ajpiano: though that shed some light on the issue, I think I got it now
00:16  mathi_: Phrogz, but when I do this => $('tr.dayTr').last().find("input.allDay").click();   then the callback is called, checkbox in interface is checked, but in that callback it passes condition, checkbox unchecked
00:16  ajpiano: thisoneguy2010, why are you doing all this crazy shit of parsing the number back and forth through a url string
00:17  thisoneguy2010: I have my reasons
00:17  Phrogz: mathi_: Are you trying to select the item only if it is checked, or are you trying to programmatically change its state and get the result in a callback?
00:17  thisoneguy2010: its temporaty until the admin panel is finished
00:17  thisoneguy2010: admin panel suports only one field
00:17  snover: ahahah. yeah, sure, temporary.
00:17  sbryant_work: ajpiano, pifantastic thanks for the help.
00:17  snover: I think we have all heard that before.
00:17  thisoneguy2010: it is
00:17  snover: “No, really, this hack is going to be removed before the final release version”
00:18  Phrogz: :D
00:18  thisoneguy2010: whatever
00:18  mathi_: Phrogz, I just want to automatically check a checkbox and trigger its callback. in the callack I have : $('input.allDay').live('click', function() { if($(this).is(':checked')) { ... } else { ... } });
00:18  eTiger13:  thisoneguy2010 why dont you just tell us what you want to accomplish with that?
00:18  eTiger13: mathi_:  that is the callback or that is IN the callback?
00:18  thisoneguy2010: I want the dialog box to be the right width in FF and safari
00:18  OhaiBBQ: hey everyone
00:19  thisoneguy2010: thats ALL
00:19  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: what do you mean "right width"?
00:19  mathi_: eTiger13, well it's a callback as u can notice, live('click', ...)
00:19  thisoneguy2010: look at the page in internet explorer.  then look at in firefox
00:19  sbryant_work: ajpiano: https://gist.github.com/aaad1550a60f41a2b4b5 is the new and improved version
00:20  mathi_: eTiger13, when I call .click(), checkbox is checked, but in callback I go into else {,...} condition, it's driving me nutts :-(
00:20  eTiger13: mathi_:  no its an event handler that has a callback. its not a callback or in a callback as you said
00:20  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: i dont have IE nor would I open anything in it
00:20  sbryant_work: that works.
00:20  thisoneguy2010: well you can see how it is broken in FF
00:20  mathi_: eTiger13, ok, I don't htink it makes a big difference to the question
00:20  thisoneguy2010: what are you looking at it wiht
00:21  eTiger13: mathi_:  in your .click() event for that checkbox, set the attribute for checked to be the opposite of whatever it is and preventDefault on it so it doesnt do it twice. then your .live() code should work
00:21  mattmtl: how can I replace a class?
00:21  eTiger13: mathi_:  it does if you have .live in a callback function
00:21  thisoneguy2010: it WORKS in IE, so you don't have to open it with ie just open it with FF or safari, or chome and you will see the brokensss
00:21  Phrogz: mathi_: I don't have the expertise or energy to dive deeper into your problem, but I might offer this advice:  a) is 'this' for sure what you think it is? b) does this problem exist if you change from .live to .bind? (Pare down your test.)
00:21  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: why dont you just let jqui open it how it wants to be opened? and an iframe? for what?
00:21  mathi_: eTiger13, it is a .live specific problem ?
00:22  eTiger13: mattmtl:  theres a replaceClass plugin or you can do .removeClass('whatever').addClass('new')
00:22  thisoneguy2010: what?
00:22  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: looks fine in chrome to me
00:23  mattmtl: eTiger13: problem is that I have no clue what is the previous class
00:23  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: and firefox
00:23  mathi_: eTiger13, is there any example for this ?
00:23  thisoneguy2010: ya it being 300px wide when it sohuld be 800 looks great
00:23  eTiger13: mattmtl:  do you want to replace ALL classes or a specific one?
00:23  mathi_: Phrogz, bind will take me some time as elements are dynamicly generated in the webpage, but i'll test if there is any difference
00:24  thisoneguy2010: thats cause the doctype is gone
00:24  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: 800 wide on both my browsers
00:24  thisoneguy2010: which breaks it in internet exploer
00:24  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: you know IE doesnt support html5 really right?
00:24  thisoneguy2010: what am I using that is html5?
00:24  mattmtl: eTiger13: I could remove all the classes
00:25  eTiger13: mathi_:  jsfiddle what code you have
00:25  olly_k: ie6 & html5 :P http://mrdoob.com/
00:25  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010:   <!DOCTYPE html> is html5
00:25  thisoneguy2010: its 300px wide now, I put the doctype back in.
00:26  mathi_: eTiger13, what should I paste ? only the code related to the problem or the whole page ?
00:26  Kindari|work: actually IE "supports" html5 pretty decently, back to ie6, if you use the "html5 shiv". small javascript that does some unknown (to me) magic and makes things still look pretty.
00:27  thisoneguy2010: ya you can use ccs3 on ie to.
00:27  thisoneguy2010: css3pie
00:27  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: is your script disabling right click?
00:28  thisoneguy2010: no
00:28  kanzie: what is the plug that lets me see what events are bound to a element in firebug
00:28  thisoneguy2010: rightclick near the bottom of the page it will let you
00:28  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: i cant right click in the dialog
00:28  erichynds: kanzie, firequery
00:28  Phrogz: mathi_: It should be 90 seconds of work to create a test case from scratch with .bind, right?
00:28  thisoneguy2010: me neither
00:28  Phrogz: mathi_: You don't need your actual page to test if it's a live/bind issue.
00:29  Phrogz: You certainly don't need all those complex selectors to test it.
00:29 * Phrogz puts air-scare quotes around 'complex'
00:29  mathi_: Phrogz, you're right ... i'll better create something from scratch, be back in 90 secs, I hope :p
00:29  BruceJohnson: hi guys - I'm a newbie here, and to jQuery in general, so be gentle! My first question though - is it posible to get a list of the css attributes for an element? ie not a list of the classes, but rather the complete list of properties being applied to an element at this moment. Just a simple hint needed, not an exact solution... thanks...
00:29  olly_k: i think it isn't worth to support nextgen tec on relics like ie 4+ 8
00:30  Phrogz: BruceJohnson: No, you need a full explicit list of all CSS properties to iterate through.
00:30  eTiger13: thisoneguy2010: replace width: url_width with width: 800, and see what happens
00:30  BruceJohnson: ok, thanks Phrogz I suspected that might be the case...
00:30  Phrogz: BruceJohnson: There exists a jQuery plug-in somewhere that iterates over 'all' properties and gives you the current value.
00:31  BruceJohnson: ahh - so as Ben told us "there's a plugin for that!" I'll try and find it...
00:32  thisoneguy2010: ok eTiger13, its wider but off center
00:38  BruceJohnson: Phrogz, I don't suppose there's an easy way to know which actual CSS class contains the attribute? So say the element has a class list of class="one two" (not to mention inherited attributes) - if I detect that 'font-size' is set to '12px' - can I also tell if that's coming from one or two or other?
00:38  arex\: Could someone help me figure out how to approach this problem? http://jsfiddle.net/arex1337/Tjwmx/3/
00:38  Phrogz: BruceJohnson: No, this information is not exposed via the DOM.
00:39  BruceJohnson: cool - thanks Phrogz...
00:40  mathi_: Phrogz, eTiger13  here is the minimalistic code : http://www.jsfiddle.net/    it displays "unchecked", though, I check it with .click(). wether the binding is done with .bind() or .live(), it will display "uncheked"
00:40  elvis2: is there a way to push additional js to a page within js code, outside of ajax?
00:41  mathi_: Phrogz, eTiger13 you may see in the result box (bottom left box), that the checkbox is checked
00:41  mathi_: when clicking Run
00:43  thisoneguy2010: i am invencible!
00:43  thisoneguy2010: I guess I needed to parseInt(url_height) before using those strings...
00:43  thisoneguy2010: now to celebrate with a little drink
00:44  aaroninfidel: anyone have a good tutorial on form error checking?
00:44  thisoneguy2010: rubyonrails validations r good...
00:45  thisoneguy2010: but might not be for you
00:45 --- Praise` is now known as Praise
00:49  arex\: it's very problematic to stop the click event in the first place, because it seems impossible to restore "default behavior" after that - is there a way for me to just delay the event until the user clicks a menu item? http://jsfiddle.net/arex1337/Tjwmx/4/
00:55  mathi_: eTiger13, , Phrogz  easiest solution : $('#test')[0].click();  works!
00:58  TimothyA: when using .submit(), how can I pass along the name/value of the submit button that was pressed?
00:59  TimothyA: I hope I don't have to resort to creating an hidden field
01:02  mathi_: TimothyA, i think that's automatically included, isn't it ?
01:03  TimothyA: mathi_: nope
01:04  mathi_: TimothyA, i'm pretty sure ths ubmit button is included if you gave it a name and value
01:04  TimothyA: well...moment, I think I'm using .submit() on the wrong element
01:04  mathi_: *the submit button
01:04  mathi_: arex\, I don't understand the question

01:12  BMCouto: Hi in a $.getJSON how do i grab the path of the json in the callback?
01:14  eTiger13: BMCouto: why would you need to do that since you are setting the path for it already? set it in a var before the call
01:14  BMCouto: eTiger13:  yeah my thinking is wrong
01:14  BMCouto: just re-making some stuff
01:14  BMCouto: 2misn pls
01:15  friskd: is there a design pattern that is used for making it so that certain js code loads only on certain pages.
01:15  friskd: right now i have a js file for each page that has its own custom js
01:16  friskd: its wrapped in    page_init function
01:16  prgmrBill: you could give each page's body tag a certain class
01:16  prgmrBill: if body has tag X then do different things
01:16  friskd: and then i have a general js function that is called on the onload
01:16  friskd: and it calls the page_init function if it exists...

01:17  BMCouto: eTiger13: i remade this but i'm still missing something - see if you get my idea pls - http://www.jsfiddle.net/VEQjf/

01:35  BMCouto: eTiger13: any idea why?
01:37  erichynds: BMCouto, why are you randomly adding methods to $.fn ?
01:38  erichynds: those don't belong there
01:39  BMCouto: erichynds: what do you mean?
01:39  erichynds: $.fn.serviceLogged
01:40  erichynds: $.fn.addToBook
01:40  BMCouto: so how should i do it?
01:40  erichynds: function serviceLogged(){}
01:40  BMCouto: serviceLogged should be like a global function
01:41  BMCouto: that verifies the same for several functions
01:41  erichynds: oi
01:41  BMCouto: got it?
01:41  erichynds: $.fn is for when you want to act upon elements... like $(".foo").serviceLogged()
01:42  OhaiBBQ: try window.myNamespace.serviceLogged ;)
01:42  erichynds: then just declare it as a function, or setup some kind of object literal
01:42  OhaiBBQ: instead of polluting $.fn
01:42  BMCouto: i have it like a function now
01:42  BMCouto: same issue
01:42  BMCouto: addToBook is not defined
01:43  coldhead: can anyone please kill me?
01:43  coldhead: really appreciate it
01:43  BMCouto: OhaiBBQ: what?
01:43  erichynds: wut
01:44  BMCouto: it always sau that the function is not defined
01:44  erichynds: well the issue isn't how you declare a function
01:44  erichynds: i was just saying as a side note
01:44  BMCouto: on $('.addToBookForm').delegate('[type=submit]', 'click keypress', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $.getJSON('../json/tests.json', addToBook(data)); });
01:44  BMCouto: addToBook is not defined
01:44  BMCouto: :S
01:45  erichynds: have you defined it above that getJSON call?
01:45  erichynds: it's not going to work the way you hve it anyway
01:46  BMCouto: erichynds: i did
01:46  BMCouto: why its not going to work?
01:47  erichynds: cuz ur invoking addToBook instead of just referencing that function as your handler
01:48  eTiger13: http://www.jsfiddle.net/VEQjf/3/ although logged and success arent doing anything
01:48  erichynds: function addToBook(data){};  $.getJSON("url", addToBook);
01:48  BMCouto: let me try
01:48  eTiger13: oops http://www.jsfiddle.net/VEQjf/4/

01:52  Vorspire: hey, in jQueryUI docs, it states that you need to change the background-image css property of the value to "images/pbar-ani.gif" - I can't seem to find this image in any of the images directories supplied in any jQuery download... so where can I get these gifs?
01:53  Vorspire: for progressbars btw
01:54  eTiger13: arex\: so why not just have the button show/hide the div as in a sliding menu or suckerfish type menu?
01:54  eTiger13: BMCouto: live link
01:54  BMCouto: eTiger13: i havent right now
01:54  eTiger13: Vorspire: where in the docs does it say that?

01:56  erichynds: var addToBook = function(){};
01:56  eTiger13: arex\: "Example Link" is for all intents and purposes a button. and the menu created in your menu could be easily switched to a div
01:57  arex\: eTiger13: I don't get what that has to do with anything. I think you are missing my problem.

01:59  erichynds: BMCouto, either your file isn't being included, or are scoped to something other than window, or you're trying to call the functions before they've been defined
02:00  BMCouto: erich i have that delegate on a html file, calling my script_global.js before that so it is

02:04  erichynds: BMCouto, the same way all jquery's methods exist under the "jQuery" variable, all yours should exist under something as well
02:04  Vorspire: lol looks lie you're busy :D
02:04  victorho: eTiger: in this example, what is the callback?
02:05  OhaiBBQ: arex\: you dont have any links in your code?
02:05  eTiger13: Vorspire: it is. in the dev bundle and in examples, progress bar, images
02:05  arex\: OhaiBBQ: Example link?
02:05  BMCouto: erichynds: and that namespace i can call it inside jquery?
02:05  erichynds: yeah
02:05  erichynds: because it exists in the global scope
02:05  eTiger13: victorho: why? dont use the plugin and do it yourself
02:05  BMCouto: they can be both inside thats it?
02:05  erichynds: yeap
02:06  BMCouto: ok thank you gonna try
02:06  eTiger13: msj: no since its not generally worth the effort. you have to manipulate the scroll event
02:06  OhaiBBQ: er, arex\, my bad
02:06  arex\: OhaiBBQ: np - do have any ideas?
02:08  msj: eTiger13, cool, i'll just forget about it then, as is not important just thought it may help knowing how to do it

02:11 @ajpiano: <3
02:11  eTiger13: arex\: i dont think anybody knows what you are trying to do or why?
02:12  arex\: eTiger13: Of course. I have a working app, but I'm just simluating the original event instead of actually using it. Which is horrible.
02:12  arex\: eTiger13: I could send you my app, but I think minimal examples are better.
02:12  arex\: eTiger13: My problem description should be enough. If it's not, please tell me so I can write it better.
02:12  eTiger13: ajpiano: what was that xy problem thing again. i think you should send it to arex\
02:13 @ajpiano: ?xy problem @ arex\
02:13  bot-t: arex\, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
02:13  arex\: Not applicable.
02:13 @ajpiano: it definitely is applicable
02:13  OhaiBBQ: lol
02:13 @ajpiano: cause what you AREN'T doing is developing an app the goal of which is to tool around with click events
02:13  eTiger13: arex\: your solution is flawed because i dont think its the right solution
02:14 @ajpiano: native versus simulated
02:14 @ajpiano: you're trying to actually accomplish a task
02:15  arex\: i am doing simulated now, i'm trying to figure out how i can do native
02:15 @ajpiano: you can't
02:15 @ajpiano: my point is that your app is NOT "simulate a native click event"
02:15 @ajpiano: your app is an app
02:15  arex\: actually it is :D
02:15 @ajpiano: and you should tell someone what the actual problem you're trying to solve is
02:15 @ajpiano: alright
02:15 @ajpiano: well glhf
02:15  snover: then your app sucks
02:15  arex\: ok, let me try it another way
02:15  eTiger13: arex\: what you are describing is unbind an event from an element and then moving that binding to a different element, which isnt a great idea
02:16  eTiger13: its like "hey user, click here. Aha! I fooled you. You actually have to click here instead"
02:17 @ajpiano: that sounds pretty useful
02:17  eTiger13: and if i was that user id be like, uh no. next site time
02:17 @ajpiano: www.sleight-of-cursor-pointer.com
02:17  eTiger13: ajpiano:  you would think its useful because you are a jqueryhole
02:17  eTiger13: ;)
02:17  arex\: My app should provide users with a GUI to describe and save algorithms for surfing the web. The user makes a new step in the algorithm by first clicking an element in an iframe. Then the user must choose what action they want (click, type, check if __).
02:18 @ajpiano: people want a gui interface for saving their interactions with webpages
02:18 @ajpiano: ?
02:18  snover: ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/snover/4nA7v/show/
02:18  arex\: There might be subsequent menus. When there are no more options, I want to do the original event in the iframe so that the user can continue to make the next algorithm step.
02:18  arex\: Does that make any sense? :o
02:18  eTiger13: no
02:18  OhaiBBQ: lol
02:18  svnlto: snover: lol
02:19  arex\: i was afraid of that
02:19  WarDragon: Is that a spamming app that learns where you click an how you fill a form, and then repeats it? :P
02:19  eTiger13: so how is it supposed to make sense for your users?
02:19 @ajpiano: in the sense that like, a unicorn riding on a narwhal to fight against german u-boats "makes sense"
02:19 @ajpiano: like you can envision it
02:19 @ajpiano: but it isn't something that can happen in the real world
02:19  arex\: WarDragon: except for the repeating/play part, you have it right!

02:21  bartzy: if I can check something in PHP, versus checking it on JS, where should I do it ?
02:21  bartzy: performance-wise.
02:21  svnlto: bartzy: server
02:21 @ajpiano: svnlto: yes, it's a waste of time to recreate $(this) $(this) $(this) over adn over again
02:21  arex\: bartzy: only checking it in JS sounds like a security risk
02:22  bartzy: arex\ : nope, it's just a width/height image thingy...
02:22 @ajpiano: "checking something" is such an extremely vague concept that the idea someone could state definitively which is "better" is absurd
02:22  arex\: svnlto: i prefix variables with $ to remind myself they are jquery objects
02:23  arex\: clicked_element vs $clicked_element etc
02:23  bartzy: ajpiano: I want to do some math calculations (division stuff for width/height image calculations)...
02:23  bartzy: simple stuff
02:23 @ajpiano: i prefix all my variables with "var" to remind myself that they're variables
02:24  erichynds: i'm lol'ing
02:24  coldhead: you should use myvar, to remind you whose they are
02:24  bartzy: anyone ? :|
02:24  arex\: ajpiano: if there is no way to manufacture a native click event, i should be able to solicite a choice from the user before the original event is fired?
02:24 @ajpiano: coldhead: at that point, then i can just use numbers for the variable part
02:24  svnlto: varajPianosVar
02:24  svnlto: A*
02:25 @ajpiano: bartzy: it stil really depends like, in what context
02:25  coldhead: myglobals = window;
02:25  bartzy: ajpiano: But generally PHP is faster ...?
02:25 @ajpiano: like, sending an ajax request, to do division of two numbers you're calculating on the client side
02:25 @ajpiano: is ... inane
02:25  bartzy: no no
02:26  bartzy: I can do it server-side before client gets the HTML ... or do it JS side..
02:26 @ajpiano: oh sorry, i guess my psychic tuner was miscalibrated
02:26  bartzy: well I guess there's no straight answer
02:26 @ajpiano: if it's calculable during the period that the page is being rendered, your instinct is correct, it would be wiser to do it in php
02:27  bartzy: OK: The reason is because I know that the server speed is consistent and I can control it, and I can't control the client performance ? or just PHP is faster than JS in general ?
02:28 @ajpiano: bartzy: what is "faster in general" is kind of a not-straight-answer
02:28 @ajpiano: it's like saying, what's faster, 100 each doing their own laundry, or 100 people sending it to the same laundromat
02:28  bartzy: OK so my question is just "Why" ?
02:28 @ajpiano: cause yes, the laundromat is really fast and awesome at doing laundry
02:29  bartzy: Why my instinct is correct ?
02:29 @ajpiano: but for all the individuals, it might be faster for them to do certain actions in a decentralised nature than to wait for some action in a different place
02:30 --- ezra-g|afk is now known as ezra-g
02:30 @ajpiano: bartzy: cause you're already painting the page on the server side, doing a bit of math is going to be trivial
02:30  bartzy: OK
02:30 @ajpiano: and not add a lot of burden
02:31 @ajpiano: and then the user won't have to wait for all that calculation to take place on the client side
02:31 @ajpiano: coldhead: i need your advice
02:31  bartzy: ajpiano: And if the JS code requires to get some data from the DOM (css width/height), then it's defintely better to do it server-side right (assuming I can set those width/height values in PHP) ?
02:31  eTiger13: OhaiBBQ: didnt know that was your real name
02:31 @ajpiano: wat
02:32 @ajpiano: if you can only calculate the numbers on the client side, sending them to the server for the math part...is bad
02:32  bartzy: yeah ofcourse.. well thanks :p
02:32  eTiger13: php only tells the browser what the paramaters for the dom are. the browser can then take those and do whatever it wants with them. thus dom manipulations are best done in the browser client side
02:35 @ajpiano: coldhead: which is faster, a charging rhinoceros or a woman's heart

02:36  nimbupani: i love the comparison ajpiano

02:37 @ajpiano: nimbupani: [20:21 ] <bartzy> if I can check something in PHP, versus checking it on JS, where should I do it ?

04:36  cwillu_at_work: rchern, no magic yet

05:09  dshap: i have two $(document).ready() blocks.  one is in a separate JS file that is included at the top of my PHP/HTML page in the <head> section, and another that is coded into the beginning of the <body> section within <script> tags.  im defining a function in the separate JS file, and i've confirmed that its code is executing before the code in the body, but when the code in the body tries to call the function it is getting a function undefined e
05:09  dshap: any ideas what could be going on here?
05:12  rchern: dshap: different scopes?
05:12  dshap: rchern: are they?
05:12  Nomikos: Is it "safe" to use element names like input, checkbox as variable names inside functions in jQuery/JavaScript?
05:12  rchern: not making it out of a closure?
05:13  dshap: rchern: what's a closure?
05:13  dshap: rchern: i was under the impression that they'd be the same scopes...am i wrong?  i'm new to this
05:15 --- Killswitch_ is now known as Killswitch
05:15  dshap: can i not define a function in document.ready() from a separate, included JS file and then call that function within the <body> of the main HTML file?
05:16  iszak: dshap, you should be able to bind events outside of jquery.
05:17  iszak: unless you mean using jquery but in a separate file in which case you can so long as it's not post-document ready.
05:17  dshap: iszak: i think the problem might be that i'm defining the function post-document ready (i.e. putting the definition within $(document).ready()), but calling the function within the document itself
05:18  iszak: well test then by putting a flag on a normal document ready, and logging the flag result on the 2nd document ready.
05:18  iszak: unless there's an alternative problem.
05:19  iszak: solution not problem
05:19  dshap: i moved the function definition outside of document.ready(), but still in the same external JS file
05:19  alerante: dshap: if you define the function inside of your function argument to document.ready(), it's only visible within the scope of that function.
05:19  dshap: and now it works

05:21  LCCX: Hello. I would like to select all of the children (and grandchildren, etc.) with a tag name of <input> of a certain element of #target-id. Might there be a nice way to do this with jQuery and could someone point me to a resource? I cannot seem to find the right terminology to describe what I want to Google.
05:22  Nomikos: $('#target-id input') ?
05:23  LCCX: Would that also select '#targetid table tr td input'?
05:23  Nomikos: yeah, it's like CSS, doesn't need to be a direct descendant
05:23  Nomikos: (Actually, jQuery selectors are very, very much like CSS)
05:24  LCCX: Ah, excellent. I was suspicious that might be the case, but did not see in the documentation an explicit example confirming it. I was messing with .children() to try and grab them.
05:27  LCCX: Hrm. Does $('#target-id input') return as an array that can be used in a for(in) JS statement? The next step is to fill the text input fields' values to match the handle values from a jQueryUI slider.
05:28  Nomikos: LCCX: it returns a jQuery "set", it's not exactly a JavaScript array I think; but you can loop through them with the .each() method
05:28  Nomikos: http://api.jquery.com/each/
05:29  Nomikos: so you could do $('#target-id input').each(function() {$(this).val('Hello world!')}); to set them all to that greeting
05:30 --- borkweb is now known as borkweb|Zzzz
05:30  cwillu_at_work: coldhead, rchern, protovis
05:30  Nomikos: $(this) will always refer to the input element that it's looping over at that point, so you can use its attributes to select what value you want to give it, as well
05:30  cwillu_at_work: it's sane.
05:30  rchern: erm huh?
05:30  cwillu_at_work: needs some jquery love, but they've embraced the "pass in a function instead of including a thousand lines of inane babble"
05:31  cwillu_at_work: rchern, charting
05:31  Nomikos: that would work as well
05:31  rchern: cwillu, you realize i have no clue what you're on about, right?
05:31  cwillu_at_work: rchern, oh, absolutely :p
05:32  cwillu_at_work: rchern, you asked me to work my non-existent magic, this is what you get ;p
05:32  rchern: heh.
05:32  rchern: i figured out my problem anyway ^__^
05:38  shing`: Is this a bug in jQuery or webkit? I noticed that in chrome, when you do a simple animation like moving a box to the right, at normal zoom, it works fine, but if you zoom out a couple times, the box jerks 50px left and then animates right.
05:39  shing`: I made a demo of if here: http://ankur.res.cmu.edu/demo.html
05:39  shing`: I think this happens in safari and firefox also
05:40  LCCX: Nomikos: Thank you very much for your assistancel. I feel I have still failed to understand something a bit more fundamental. Can I pass the unnamed function additional parameters?
05:41  Nomikos: LCCX: ahm.. it takes 2 optional params already, I don't think you can add extra. Maybe you can use the function body code to find/fetch them?
05:42  LCCX: hmm...
05:42  Nomikos: LCCX: are the values different for each input element?
05:42  Nomikos: Maybe you need to change your approach
05:42  LCCX: possibly.
05:44  LCCX: I have some multi-handle sliders and each slider has some text input fields (in case the user wants to type an exact value)
05:45  Nomikos: Then I'd put a .change() to the value of the slider, and when that fires, use its value to update the input field that belongs to it
05:45  Nomikos: if I'm guessing right
05:45  shing`: anyone have any idea?
05:46  LCCX: Nomikos: How do I know which handle's value changed?
05:46  Nomikos: LCCX: that depends on the sliders I'm afraid
05:46  LCCX: Nomikos: How so?
05:47  Nomikos: Never worked with them myself, native or plugin, but I bet they have some event that fires when you change their settings
05:47  LCCX: Hmm, k.
05:48  Nomikos: LCCX: if you view them as say, a select menu, those have an onchange() handler that you can use
05:48  Nomikos: the sliders /should/ have something similar
05:48  LCCX: The handles?
05:48  Nomikos: got a url?
05:48  LCCX: ah. The sliders do.
05:48  LCCX: yeah
05:49  LCCX: http://www.logsine.com/sovsoc/
05:50  LCCX: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
05:52  LCCX: So I am pretty sure I want to use change: func() when it is initialized and the values option/method.
05:53  Nomikos: yeah, looks like
05:53  LCCX: Change fires when the slider UI element as a whole changes though, so I figured I needed to loop through all the handles and all the text boxes.
05:54  LCCX: I could write a bunch of getElementById in a switch and some other stuff, but it gets nasty quick, and it doesn't exactly accomplish the "learn jQuery" goal.
05:56  Nomikos: At http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider#option-values , the //getter code, you could use that to get all the values, and then loop through the inputs, setting each value to an input?
05:57 --- bananasontoast is now known as b[a]nanasontoast
05:57  Nomikos: I *think*, if you use a var values, .each(function(i) {$(this).val(values[i])}; // might work
05:58  Nomikos: it would grab values from the scope above it (it has to be defined obviously), and use the index parameter to fish out values one by one, going over each input
05:58  Nomikos: ehrm.. the first values refers to the variable name, the second to the slider values, sorry :-)
05:59  LCCX: I'm getting confused about the order of the loops.
05:59  LCCX: I can get the values with values = $(slider_id).slider( "option", "values" );
05:59  LCCX: I can get the input elements with $(slider_id+"-textfields input").each(function(index){});
05:59  Nomikos: ah,
06:00  Nomikos: you *get* the input elements with just the selector: $(slider_id+"-textfields input")
06:00  LCCX: the input fields each have their own id
06:00  LCCX: er, yeah
06:00  Nomikos: you can then loop through them with each() and give them a value from the values array
06:01  Nomikos: the ids would be useful if the slider's values also had some type of name to refer to, but afaics there's only the values array
06:04  LCCX: I had gone with "slider-ID" for each slider, "slider-ID-textfields" for the parent of each slider's associated text boxes, and a named ID (with semantic worth/value) to the text boxes themselves
06:06  Nomikos: Hm-mm, can't hurt
06:07  Nomikos: but not sure the input ids will be necessary or useful, as the values array is basically just that (no keys)
06:07  LCCX: I'm stuck that if I use the text fields as the outer loop and the slider values as the inner loop (using the outer-loop-provided index to pick out values from the inner loop value array), then I somehow need the inner function to have the ID of the initial slider whose .change() triggered
06:08  Nomikos: ah, right
06:09  LCCX: If I use the selector values as the outer loop, then I have no JS array with indexes that I can use as the inner loop
06:09  Nomikos: in the change() function body, you can also set thisSlider = $(this); , then use thisSlider inside the each() function body
06:10  Nomikos: (one of JavaScript's little gotchas, I believe..)
06:10  Nomikos: Does that make sense?
06:11  LCCX: um, maybe
06:11  Nomikos: pls try :-) it's 6:11 here and my customer is going to wake up wanting good news somewhere soon
06:11  Nomikos: so.. I should get back to that for a bit..
06:12  LCCX: Yep, trying.
06:12  LCCX: Thank you very much and good luck. That is early!
06:13  Nomikos: Late, but yeah
06:13  Nomikos: (vampire schedule)
06:13  LCCX: Oh, haha. I have a couple friends who work night-shift. :)
06:22  Vorspire: ffs why does recursion through a list of div's in a tree-like fashion have to be so... awkward and inefficient
06:23  iszak: Vorspire, it's not.
06:23  Vorspire: well i fixed the efficiency part at least
06:25  Vorspire: but for some reason, when using a local variable that incriments by 1 with $.each, for some reason that integer is incrementing by 2, even though the call is index++
06:25  Vorspire: but it's still awkward and i managed to fix it :/
06:26  Nomikos: Doesn't each() already pass an optional incrementing index to it's function?
06:27  Nomikos: each(function(index) { // do stuff
06:27  Cork: yes
06:27  Cork: ?each
06:27  bot-t: .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
06:28  Vorspire: yea but in the context i need the index variable is useless like that
06:28  Vorspire: i dont use the standfard each-index
06:28  LCCX: Yeah, the index bit is working just fine. :P
06:29  Nomikos: Vorspire: I thought they might mess with one another
06:29  Cork: Vorspire: could you pastebin your code?
06:29  LCCX: Well, it is very late so I need to head off to bed. Maybe tomorrow I'll figure it out. :)
06:29  Vorspire: the index i have to use is declared outside of the scope of the $.each and increments by 1 every time $.each is called, the each-index I use for sub-indexing, but the main-index goes up by 2 a time, which was wierd, so I set it to idx += 0.5; which fixed it...
06:29  Cork: Vorspire: most of the times the default index works fine
06:29  Vorspire: nevermind now i re-wrote the entire elgorithm for handling the structure of div's
06:30  Cork: O_o
06:30  Cork: Vorspire: your code is buggy
06:30  Cork: if you have to use floating point values to get +1 increments you have a serius problem
06:31  Vorspire: it boiled down the 2 each functions itterating the same elements twice by accidnet during recursion, i used find instead of children :P
06:31  Vorspire: children fixed that
06:31  Vorspire: but i still re-wrote it all lol
06:32  Vorspire: the index was used to determine the level of indent for a menu-node, which isn't needed now thankfully due to the re-write

06:32  Vorspire: (Cork[home]): acorn.vita-nex.com - The menu plugin on the left

06:32  Vorspire: sorry, was gIRC :P
06:35  Cork: Vorspire: its node_menu?
06:35  Vorspire: yea
06:35  Cork: well what ever it did before it looks fine now :)
06:35  Cork: nice menu btw :)
06:36  Vorspire: ty :) first plugin i've wrote after a few months away from jQuery :)
06:36 * Cork isn't to found of the use of table though, but thats a matter of taste
06:36  Vorspire: yea, i hate tables too
06:37  Vorspire: it's the only table i'll ever use, because of the width x height problems of div's as content containers after <body>
06:37  Vorspire: the page must not expand past 95%x95%
06:38  Vorspire: i foun that using div's the strucutre the layout wasn't very friendly, especially adding all the floats to the elements etc
06:38  Cork: :)
06:38  Cork: ya, its a bit tricky ^^
06:38  Vorspire: but the menu is purely div + button :D
06:38  Cork: and that images can escape from divs is another problems
06:39  Cork: Vorspire: ya i saw that
06:40 --- Killswitch_ is now known as Killswitch
06:40  Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/pZyn7N6x - the source I use in the php file for generating the menu: you could effectively simulate an entire directory tree easily :D
06:42 * Cork nods
06:43  Cork: i guess your going to do that from an sql loop or something when your down with the front end
06:44  jham111: can someone tell me what this might look like written with jquery? http://pastie.org/1231812
06:45  Vorspire: well, it would look a lot different, maybe a few $ here and there and a selector or two...
06:45  Vorspire: (Cork): exactly :D
06:45  Vorspire: (Cork[home]): exactly :D
06:45  Vorspire: wtf lol
06:46  Cork: jham111: where are you using the init() ?
06:46  Cork: Vorspire: your client is broken ;P
06:46  jham111: I am not using it as of right now...just trying to understand if it needs to be re-written..a lot of the if / else stuff seems to be based on how browsers interpret..which jquery takes care of right?
06:47  Cork: jham111: well the attach things would simply be $(function() { });
06:47  Vorspire: well it can be re-written, but no need to fix what's not broken :P
06:47  iszak: jham111, http://pastie.org/1231822
06:47  Cork: jham111: what you have there is nativly supported in jquery
06:48  jham111: top I believe is the "window"
06:49  iszak: well is it or isn't it, I don't want believers.
06:49  Cork: its funny how much less code you need when you convert old scripts to jq :)
06:49  iszak: plus I can tell there's more code, e.g. what uses the topmost function.
06:49  jham111: haha. let me give you the whole thing

06:50  Vorspire: for the love of team support, use http://pastebin.com :P
06:50  jham111: don't really care for the console stuff...just curious how it can be cleaned up with jquery
06:51  arex\: jsfiddle
06:51  Cork: jham111: wow you could almost remove all of the js from there >_>
06:53  iszak: jham111, http://pastie.org/private/nomzijid5i6xjx4cd307bw
06:54  jham111: iszak: thanks..going to give it a shot
06:54  iszak: add some console.log("message"); to see.
06:55  iszak: jham111, also you're binding the "click" event on blur, wtF?
06:56  iszak: binding the click function on blur, sorry.
06:56  iszak: e.g. top.attachEvent('onblur', processIFrameClick);
06:58  jham111: hrm... this didn't seem to work http://pastie.org/private/t3veadq9vv2vqwm1jcqa
06:59  Cork: jham111: the isOverIFrame needs to be outside of $(function()
06:59  Cork: or move all your functions inside it
07:00  Vorspire: (jham111): http://pastebin.com/VnY9GEWY ?
07:00  Cork: (i would prefer that last one)
07:00  jham111: hrm nope
07:01  Cork: Vorspire: you forgot the state variable
07:01  jham111: btw - my nope was to Cork's suggestion of the isOverIframe..that didn't work
07:01  jham111: I get no console outputs when hovering in/out of the iframe
07:02  Cork: do you get any errors?
07:02  jham111: did I ever forget to tell you guys how much of a moron I am? you would think forgetting to include the entire jquery library would be a red flag
07:02  jham111: lol
07:03  jham111: works now
07:03  jham111: thanks
07:03  Vorspire: xD
07:03  Cork: lol
07:04  Cork: jham111: but have a look at Vorspire's example it should simplify your code even more
07:05  jham111: ok
07:05  Vorspire: ahh there, i forgot you were using a textware to display text, i just went for the webkit console.log lol
07:05  Vorspire: look at this one instead
07:05  Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/ANzy3NfF
07:05  Vorspire: textarea*
07:08  jham111: Vorspire looks good, but the iframe actually itself can't capture the click
07:08  jham111: that is why the blur is used
07:08  jham111: when I ran your code..it won't capture the click
07:08  Vorspire: ahh :P sorry, i don't really work with iFrames
07:08  jham111: haha that is ok
07:08  Vorspire: but you get my jist with that code :P
07:08  jham111: your code is clean though
07:09  Vorspire: i'm a c# dev heh, it's natural xD
07:10  Vorspire: ?weather Newcastle Upon Tyne
07:10  bot-t: Vorspire, Newcastle Upon Tyne - Weather: Clear, 4°C / 39°F
07:10  Vorspire: ohh i ain't goin outside today lol
07:10  Vorspire: 6am... gnite :)
07:11  Cork: uh, thats not night, thats morning :)
07:11  Cork: <- starts working then ^^
07:18  jham111: damn this is annoying. So the first time this page loads....the iframe doesn't recognize a click, I have to physically click in my document first, then the iframe forit to be recognized. Even setting focus on the window, on teh document, doing a trigger click on teh document/window isn't working
07:19  Vorspire: (jham111): you can trigger any events that you need to without those events actually happening
07:19  Vorspire: for example: $(document).trigger('click');
07:20  Cork: Vorspire: that might not actually be true
07:20  jham111: yea I know, that is what I am doing...I even have that on a 5 sec timeout..yet when I try to make my first click over the iframe..it doesn't register
07:20  jham111: I have to physically click somewhere in my document (outside the iframe) and back into the iframe for it to register
07:20  Cork: jham111: is your focus in the correct element?
07:21  Cork: jham111: might be that the iframe has focus
07:21  Nomikos: Is there a way to force an image to reload? I'm changing some vars serverside and want jQuery to refresh an image on the page
07:22  jham111: I have tried setting focus to the body, the document, the window
07:22  Cork: Nomikos: append a parameter to the url
07:22  jham111: and none work
07:22  Nomikos: Cork: something like Math.rand() ?
07:22  jham111: guess I could set focus to an actual div or something on the page first
07:22  Nomikos: I'd hoped that would not be necessary
07:23  Cork: Nomikos: 'url/image.png?' + Date.now()
07:24  Cork: Nomikos: thats how you normally work your self around the cache
07:25  jhan09: Hi. How can I select a custom html tag that I made? For example how can I select <something> with jquery ?
07:25  jham111: hrm..setting focus to a texarea worked, but not to a div or anything
07:25  codemonkey701: for some reason my if statement doesn't work in webkit browsers http://www.jsfiddle.net/vKsJ4/
07:25  Hierofant: $(something)  doesnt work?
07:25  Cork: jhan09: just select it like any other element
07:26  Cork: jhan09: but its normally a bad idea to invent your own tags in html
07:26  Hierofant: I guess it's $('something')
07:26  Cork: it is
07:26  jhan09: Yes that works, I forgot to put it in a $(document).ready
07:26  jhan09: Thanks
07:27  Cork: jhan09: but normally you sould use classes or id's instead
07:27  Vorspire: codemonkey701, try: current_src !== image_url
07:27  Cork: jhan09: if you use custom tags the page won't validate, and might give you strange problems in browsers
07:27  jhan09: Cork: I don't really care for validations.
07:27  codemonkey701: Vorspire i did and it was a no go i will try again
07:28  Cork: Vorspire: that will only be even more precise
07:28  codemonkey701: Vorspire: no go
07:28  Cork: codemonkey701: have you checked so you have the same type of url in them?
07:28  Cork: with an alert or console.log?
07:28  Vorspire: codemonkey701, isn't this.href supposed to be: window.location.href?
07:28  Vorspire: sec
07:28  Vorspire: i may have read it wrong :P
07:29  codemonkey701: Cork:  good idea i will check
07:29  Cork: Vorspire: no its this on an a tag
07:29  Cork: so its the currently clicked links target
07:30  Cork: codemonkey701: it might be that one is an absolute, and the other is relative or something like that
07:30  Nomikos: Cork: thanks, it's working
07:30  Vorspire: well if it helps, here's a small "class" function I wrote to help with URL's :P http://acorn.vita-nex.com/JavaScript/url.vn.js

07:41  zackattack: every time i do a jquery $.post('page.php', data,function(blah) { doSoemthing(); }); ... the page refreshes automatically and i can't check out the results in firebug. what gives?
07:42  Cork: zackattack: are you doing it in a submit or click event?
07:42  Cork: or what?
07:42  zackattack: yeah, a click event
07:42  Cork: on a link?
07:42  zackattack: a $("button#buttonid").click(function() { // yea... } );
07:42  Cork: a button...
07:42  zackattack: the $.post() is where the // yeah is.

08:44 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 92 seconds
08:44  patrickgamer: ManxPower: i don't think <th> will carry down to other rows - it's just a formatting tag
08:44  ideea: patrickgamer, its just a modal window, i have already found modal window, that i like, but there isnt switch between two modal windows :)
08:44  patrickgamer: ManxPower: i don't think you can use it to reference cells beneath it
08:44  ManxPower: patrickgamer, then I'm back to where I started.
08:44  ideea: patrickgamer, open modal window on site, that i gave, and press "register" button and u will see :)
08:45  ManxPower: How to a name a column "mobile" for your example?
08:45 --- cuco_ is now known as cuco
08:45  ManxPower: use a colgroup?
08:47  patrickgamer: ManxPower: that's a loaded question. it totally depends on how the table is being generated in the back-end. Presuming you're doing some kind of nested loop in read in data from a PHP/DB array somewhere, you should be able to reference that systematically for labeling when you push to the client
08:47  patrickgamer: ideea: the window is up and I see it. what is the second window you want to switch to (remember I don't read russian!!) :)
08:48  patrickgamer: ManxPower: if you had no control over generating the table, you could scrape the text within each cell to tell what kind of content was inside
08:48  ManxPower: I control the table
08:48  ideea: patrickgamer, ;D right
08:48  ideea: there is two buttons in that window
08:49  ideea: press right button
08:49  ManxPower: patrickgamer, I realize I did not phrase my question well, but that is the underlying issue.
08:49  ideea: green button :)
08:49  patrickgamer: ideea: ah, i see
08:49  patrickgamer: ideea: the one button doesn't swing the first window all the way out of view...
08:49  patrickgamer: ideea: why can't you just use show/hide
08:50  patrickgamer: ideea: something simple like http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
08:51  ideea: hm
08:52  ideea: so, on this site - it is one html page, that loads into modal window and just show/hide between them?
08:52  patrickgamer: yeah, loads with both hidden
08:52  patrickgamer: click the register button, show the first. click the arrow or whatever, hide/fadeout and show the 2nd
08:52  patrickgamer: then go back all based on buttons
08:52  ideea: hm, i can make this in one, that white area, but there is two areas, so, two modal windows. nope?:)
08:54  patrickgamer: ideea: i don't know if i'd use two windows... just rewrite the contents of the same window using effects
08:55  patrickgamer: ideea: also, maybe modal windows isn't the best choice for what you're trying to do? have you considered other presentation options?
08:57  ideea: like what?
08:57  ideea: i have two modules, signin and signup,that i need to load into modal window, like here
08:57  patrickgamer: ideea: why modal?
08:57  ideea: why not?:D
08:58  ideea: client wants login/registrer like here
08:58  patrickgamer: ideea: well, if you're having troubles with it, maybe there's something easier... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqWindowsEngine
08:59  patrickgamer: ideea: but remember, clients only know what it looks like, they normally don't know anything about the code itself. There's more than one way to make something look like something else
08:59  ideea: patrickgamer, ofcourse, i made it with modal window. problem was - how to show two windows, i will change content in one, that is even bette :) thanks
08:59  patrickgamer: np
09:01  snover: patrickgamer: there are at least 2 better suggestions I can think of off the top of my head for modal dialogues than that
09:02  motaka2: can js determine the real height and width of an image?
09:02  patrickgamer: well, to be fair, i'm kind of distracted with my own problems right now. Just trying to be helpful why sorting my own issue out
09:02  patrickgamer: **while
09:03  snover: patrickgamer: what is your problem?
09:06  patrickgamer: snover: i've got to bind an image request to clicks of a specific type of element, and just using a straight delegate causes race conditions in FF and Chrome. I'm trying to find a way to suspend the onmenuclick function call until after my function finishes
09:07  patrickgamer: i'm going to try copying the existing function to a var and unbind the old function, then call the var after i'm finished - but i've got a feeling it won't work
09:07  snover: patrickgamer: dunno what onmenuclick is…
09:07  snover: patrickgamer: I am not sure I understand
09:07  patrickgamer: snover: it's a stupid attribute/property microsoft thinks is clever and special
09:08  patrickgamer: snover: imagine a page with a list of files. when you click on a image next to a filename, a menu opens up with a bunch of options (copy, check-out, delete, etc.)
09:08  snover: patrickgamer: It’s not documented anywhere on msdn.microsoft.com… are you sure about that?
09:09  snover: patrickgamer: ok, so far so good
09:09  patrickgamer: snover: :) small sample: http://dpaste.com/260016/
09:09  snover: so um
09:09  snover: why does it matter if it doesn’t work in not-IE if you are using some sort of proprietary thing that is so proprietary it is not even documented and you really probably should not be doing that?
09:10  inf_loop: hi. any pointers on how to get the functionality of .detach() in regular javascript? (I still use jquery 1.3, because a lot of code is relying on it).
09:10  snover: inf_loop: use the compat library.
09:10  snover: plugin. whatever.
09:10  patrickgamer: snover: it's sharepoint server - it's proprietary, but not at all small distribution
09:10  snover: then upgrade to 1.4!
09:10  snover: patrickgamer: nope, that doesn’t explain it
09:11  patrickgamer: snover: it's really not rare - default Sharepoint functionality. i'm testing on a hosted solution (think out-of-the-box site farm) - no custom/modular tech included
09:13  snover: patrickgamer: SP.UI.PopoutMenu.onMenuClick(evt) ?
09:13  patrickgamer: snover: anyway, the point is that binding has to be done b/c the menu doesn't exist on page load - it's instantiated when you click the menu icon. and the race condition fails in FF and Chrome, which are major browsers for our clients
09:13  patrickgamer: snover: that looks right
09:13  inf_loop: snover: ok. thanks.
09:14  snover: I’m missing the part where you need to use a custom event
09:14  snover: instead of click
09:14  snover: and the part where “race condition” happens
09:15  patrickgamer: snover:  LOL okay sorry. so, I don't need to use custom event. I'm binding a normal click
09:15  snover: var working = false; $('foo').bind('click', function (e) { if (working) return; $.ajax({ success: function (data) { working = false; } }); });
09:15  patrickgamer: but while my click is running, the other function kicks off and redirects before my image request completes
09:15  snover: what other function?
09:16  patrickgamer: snover: the: onmenuclick="javascript:navigateMailToLinkNew('https://unilyticsmicrosoftonlinecom-2....
09:16  patrickgamer: for example
09:18  snover: well that all depends upon whether click comes before onmenuclick or not
09:18  inf_loop: snover: reason for having to stick with 1.3 is because jquery 1.4 doesn't seem to play nice with my ajax code (running scripts from pulled data). (http://pastebin.com/MJm5rJuR). Any changes in API that causes the $.globalEval to not work?
09:19  patrickgamer: snover: yeah... i'm going to look at this thing i started and then check back here
09:19  patrickgamer: thanks for looking at it
09:22  zackattack: what's the best event listener to use for an <input type="text"> ... that it will be triggered any time a key is pressed, including a paste (ctrl/cmd-v)??

09:24  zackattack: thx bro
09:25  nlogax: yes, motaka2
09:25  motaka2: how ?
09:25  nlogax: there are some properties on the image itself, you can also use jQuery's height() and width()
09:25  nlogax: just make sure it has loaded first
09:26  nlogax: can't know before, unless you've set some dimensions on it already
09:26  motaka2: nlogax: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/623172/how-to-get-image-size-height-width-using-javascript

09:33  zackattack: keypress isn't quite right
09:34  nwillems90: damn, thats not nice. is jquery compatible with any major css grid-systems?
09:34  doonie: its not the grid system that is the problem, its the reset file
09:34  doonie: don't use that one from blueprint and yer fine
09:34  nwillems90: ahh
09:34  doonie: and the one with the form stuff
09:35  nwillems90: wouldn't that break blueprint instead? :)
09:35  doonie: use html5boilerplate + add the span-x divs and you're set heh
09:35  doonie: that's what I have currently
09:35  zackattack: the correct answer is keyup. thanks!
09:35  doonie: np ;p
09:35  Cork: zackattack: what is it that you want the keypress isn't giving you?
09:36  Cork: zackattack: if you hold the key down it won't repeat with keyup though
09:36  doonie: to react when the user releases I guess heh
09:36  nwillems90: Couldn't it be solved by providing a CSS scope for jquery and the resetting things to some sane default inside that environment?

09:37  red: Any ideas what I should be looking for?
09:38  red: I could always make our journalists create such wordlists for their language though, but would be easier if there was some nifty site which offered such lists :)

11:05  Cygn: Bertrand:  http://www.3tagetape.de/jQuery.html < it just doesn't work like expected....          $("<div/>").appendTo('body'); adds <div></div> before <body>  $("</div>").appendTo('body');  adds nothing and </div> should be added :(
11:05  iszak: they have xhr.onreadystatechange = jQuery.noop;
11:06  iszak: where noop is an empty function.
11:06  iszak: whether that's a bug fix, who knows.
11:06  Bertrand: $("<div>").appendTo("body")
11:07  iszak: but if it's not fixed, I guess you'll have to a) patch it yourself b) wait until it's patched c) don't use jquery d) use another framework
11:07  iszak: it's just unfortunate if it's the last 2.
11:07  kobhqlt: hi there, i've got a problem. I've got a ajax query which on success, put a .click() on a div. But this ajax is called in a loop, so when i click after 3/4 ajax calls, i've got like if i've clicked 4 times (surely because the bind is set 4times), how to unbind a .click function ? or how to know that the click is already binded ?
11:07 --- hokapoka_ is now known as hokapoka
11:07  Cygn: Bertrand: But this would add <div> wouldn't it?
11:08  hemanth: is there a way to use get() to get the js and css also from relative paths? That is i say $.get('/var/www/index.php', function(data) {... it just renders the text, but fail to get the relative paths of css and js
11:08  Bertrand: cyga: what are you trying to wrap a div around the contents of body?
11:08  Cygn: Bertrand: exactly
11:08  Bertrand: who let you get this far? lol
11:09  Cygn: Bertrand: :) I'm nearly like start crying, this has to be possible
11:09  hemanth: even load() fails
11:10  Bertrand: it is possible, wait one mo - phone call
11:10  philk__: iszak: not using jquery is no longer an option. The whole app is designed around it.

11:11  noaXess: hi all
11:11  iszak: philk__, so patch it then?
11:11  Cygn: Bertrand: Thx :)
11:11  philk__: instead of "$('Obligation[code=' + code + ']', this.currentNode.ownerDocument).remove();" how could I use the DOM element function to remove the element?
11:11  noaXess: if i dynamically change data in a div, i can't use browser back/forward function.. is there any fix to get it work?
11:11  iszak: philk__, try nightly/svn!
11:12  philk__: iszak: I will try nightly
11:14  iszak: philk__, beware the nightly wasn't updated for ages.
11:15  philk__: iszak: its not a nightly then...
11:16  Cygn: It just seems like jQuery is trying to make fun of me ^^
11:17  doonie: philk__ best is to create a ticket defining the problem with an example code and paypal a dev or two ;D
11:17  iszak: philk__, I know.
11:18  Bertrand: Cygn: $("<div>").append($("body *")).appendTo("body") // appends everything * in the body emelement to a div, which is then appened to the body

11:21  Vienzzion: Bertrand: can u explain a little about !function(){} how it works
11:22  Bertrand: Vienzzion: sorry, I don't know anything about !function
11:22  Vienzzion: dam...
11:23  DrChandra: hmmmm
11:23  Bertrand: damn
11:23  Vienzzion: do u know what ! would do in javascript
11:24  Vienzzion: it is use to create an anomyous function
11:24  Vienzzion: by facebook guys
11:24  patrickgamer: I'm having a hard time thinking my way through this sample problem I created for myself. A second pair of eyes would be helpful: http://jsfiddle.net/ReCxJ/
11:24  Cygn: @Bertrand: Just recognized: WrapAll() Just gives me that functionality

11:58  Bertrand: its not about hover, it shows you uses of stop with animate - the hhover is simply triggering the animate
11:58  red: Anyone know an simple way of getting a node id by trid?
11:59  shal3r: Bertrand, and is it the same with slideDown/up
11:59 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 95 seconds
11:59  Bertrand: patrickgamer: you remove the click, nothing to preserve
12:01  Bertrand: shalr ?.stop uses the slideup/down set as an example
12:01  patrickgamer: Bertrand: but I'm adding it back on mouse leave   $(this).attr('onclick', tempFunk);
12:02  kobhqlt: hi there
12:02  kobhqlt: I've got a js script
12:02  kobhqlt: and i need to return a value
12:02  shal3r: Bertrand, i think it's a problem with animations in callback. If i add stop in callback in slidedown, it stops working
12:03  kobhqlt: but .. when i alert() my function call to the return value, it tells "Undefined"
12:03  kobhqlt: i really dunno how to fix it ..
12:03  kobhqlt: http://pastebin.com/cdPpMv9t
12:03  kobhqlt: line 29
12:03  Bertrand: shal3r: exactly, it stops the animation
12:05  Bertrand: patrickgamer: you're using raw js to remove the attribute and JQ to set the attribute that you've removed... why not use bind and unbind?
12:06  shal3r: Bertrand, so, how to stop queue building without stopping animation?
12:06 --- Bertrand is now known as bertrand_afk
12:10  patrickgamer: bertrand: probably b/c i've been up for 22h and i'm making silly mistakes
12:10  patrickgamer: oh wait
12:10  patrickgamer: no, i can't bind
12:12  patrickgamer: this is a proof of concept for the real problem, which is binding to a menu that doesn't exist on doc.ready - it's only instantiated when a user clicks a button (and then is de-constructed when they mouse-off)
12:14  openstandards: has anyone been playing around with .data yet/
12:15 --- carter05_ is now known as carter05
12:15  shal3r: I just don't get how to correctly use .stop() for this animation to avoid queue building. I tried to many combinations of stop() but it always gives weird results. http://pastie.org/1232246
12:17  kanzie: if I have a class with a backgorund, and when the user clicks I want to override the background by tempporarly adding a new class. How can I make the new class override the already existing one, right now addClass adds the class to the end of the class-definition, making the already present classes override it
12:19  kanzie: best would be if I could toggle, but then again, I need a default fallback and that is what doesn't work
12:20  Northwoods: http://jsfiddle.net/SKSC5/
12:20  Cork: kanzie: it depends on when you have the class in your css
12:20  kanzie: yeah, just noticed
12:20  Cork: kanzie: or if you use !important
12:20  kanzie: cork: thanks...
12:21  Vorspire: well I got loads of sleep... not :P
12:21  Northwoods: name='amount[]' , way to access this element ? http://jsfiddle.net/SKSC5/
12:22  Cork: $('input[name="amount\[\]"]')
12:22  Northwoods: Cork , i got 8 of them , .each ?
12:22  Cork: yup
12:22  Northwoods: Cork thanks
12:22  Cork: if you don't have anything else to filter on
12:23  Northwoods: aah , i could use class
12:23  Vorspire: that method is awesome for passing arrays to POST for PHP (using name="key[value]")
12:23  Cork: Northwoods: your html is invalid btw
12:23  Cork: you repeat your id, thats not allowed
12:24  Northwoods: :)
12:24  Northwoods: that was just copy paste
12:24  Northwoods: i understand
12:24  Vorspire: hehe
12:25  Vorspire: custom attributes can be assigned to HTML elements with the data- prefix: these attributes will still be validated successfully and are great for storing custom values
12:26  Vorspire: so if you find yourself repeating the ID for whatever reason, just revert to data-id
12:26  Northwoods: Vorspire: right
12:26  Northwoods: but most guys here recommended me to put the data inside the javascript , instead of custom attribute
12:27  Northwoods: but i still love and go by customer-attr
12:27  Northwoods: s/customer/custom
12:27  Vorspire: prefix that attribute with data-
12:27  Northwoods: Vorspire: not necessarily
12:27  Northwoods: it can be zebra='blah'
12:28  Vorspire: It won't pass W3C validation
12:28  Vorspire: it works, but because they are HTML elements not XML nodes, it won't pass :/
12:28  Northwoods: you mean data-id='blah' passes W3C ?
12:28  Vorspire: yea
12:28  philk__: IE does not call "onchange" until the focus is lost in the <input> element. I want to change the enablement of some button when the user enters some text. Should I use keydown event instead?
12:28  krz: i need to insert 5 lines of html block into a dom element. whats the best way to do this?
12:29  Vorspire: the data- prefix was enabled in HTML 4.0 as a means for custom data storage
12:30  Vorspire: buuuuut I could be wrong these days, seems jQueryUI uses aria- prefix for some attributes
12:31  Vorspire: (krz): $('div').html('<span>My HTML</span>');
12:32  Vorspire: (philk__): keydown may not be sufficient
12:34  kanzie: what is the jqueyr event representing "change"
12:34  kanzie: sorry, I mean blur
12:34  chrisq: can an ajax() post be cancelled by a function in the beforeSend option?

12:35  chrisq: Cork: great, do you have a link or pointer to how this would be done?
12:35  chrisq: Cork: but isnt the xhr returned by the ajax function?
12:36  krz: Vorspire: but i would like to put it as a line by line format
12:36  Vorspire: (philk__): try this: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/onChanged
12:36  Vorspire: (krz): what do you mean "line by line format"?
12:36  Cork: chrisq: you have the xhr object in the callback, just pass it...
12:36  Cork: what was it... abort()?
12:36 * Cork checks
12:37  Cork: chrisq: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-abort-method
12:37  krz: Vorspire: http://pastebin.com/6LPt9FCE
12:37  krz: something like the above ^^
12:37  chrisq: Cork: thanks for the help, what i'm trying to do is attach some form of confirm to the ajax post which makes it possible to cancel by user
12:38  Vorspire: ahh i see :P
12:38  chrisq: you'd think that was a normal thing to do?
12:39  Vorspire: (krz): try using the line-break character after H1 and P
12:39  Vorspire: that's \n
12:39  Cork: chrisq: donno how much use it actually would have, requests are normally farly fast
12:40  Vorspire: (krz): http://pastebin.com/10T2Sa3m is this what you mean?
12:41  patrickgamer: bertrand: so i switched out the attr functions for bind/unbind and it solved the issue
12:41  chrisq: Cork: ok, so ajax does not wait for beforesend to finish?
12:41  krz: yea
12:41  krz: thanks
12:41  Vorspire: np :)
12:41  patrickgamer: bertrand which is good, but i'm confused why it didn't work in my first approach. either way, whatever. thanks for helping me along
12:41  Vorspire: I know it sucks that in JS, strings can not be line-wrapped like in most other OOP languages
12:44  krz: thanks Vorspire works :-)
12:44  Vorspire: awesome, np

12:45  timing_: khinester: change the query serverside
12:45  Vorspire: oh no, autocomplete, everyone evacuate the channel quickly and sensibly.
12:45  timing_: lol, why?
12:45  Vorspire: IMO autocomplete has been one of the most tricky things to work with so far :P
12:46  Vorspire: and it seems to be a hot topic for support requests
12:47  khinester: i have a search form but if a user types a search string with Caps it does not find it, i will check the server side query
12:47  khinester: and get back
12:49  Vorspire: (khinester): You want to make auto-complete case-INsensitive if that's your problem
12:49  timing_: Vorspire: lol, that's what he asked
12:49  timing_: 12:44:55 < khinester> how do i make autocomplete case sensitive?

12:51  ruby_on_tails: Vorspire: why bread ? why not butter ?
12:51  Vorspire: why not toast?
12:51  Vorspire: :P
12:51  ruby_on_tails: pizza
12:52  Vorspire: that scrolling things is smooth to me imo
12:52  ruby_on_tails: hmm
12:52  Vorspire: but i think everyone forgot about the old, but very much awesome, <marquee> html tag :D
12:53  timing_: yeah why not use marquee?
12:53  timing_: that's some native scrolling!
12:53  Vorspire: :P
12:53  ruby_on_tails: I have not even heard of that tag

12:54  flayks: do you have an idea why i have margin in the bottom when you scroll entierly the boxes ? http://www.tmp.b2architectes.fr/
12:54  Vorspire: (shal3r): i had to overcome a very similar problem with my nodeMenu this morning
12:54  Vorspire: the key is not the .stop() function
12:54  Vorspire: let me digress...
12:55  shal3r: .stop() function just ruins everything - it cannot work with callback animations
12:56  kanzie: so how do I capture the event-triggerer in delegate?
12:56  kanzie: $(this) doesn't do it
12:57  Vorspire: given the element you are animating, I found that my problem could be fixed by using a check on that element before calling the animation method: if( $('div').is(':animated') == false ){ $('div').toggleSlide(400); }
12:58  Vorspire: (shal3r): @above :)

13:15  yonk: and the click event don't work
13:16  Vorspire: got a live page?
13:16  doonie: cause the si is loaded by ajax maybe
13:16  Vorspire: if it's to do with <iframe> - the click event handler won't work
13:16  Vorspire: learned that this morning (thanks Cork)
13:16  yonk: yes, it's with ajax

13:47  bertrand_afk: darkangel@ trac it at http://dev.jqueryui.com/
13:49  Vorspire: reg_f: of course jQuery can help with that, especially if you use AJAX to get the ad info
13:49  Vorspire: (greg_f):
13:50  darkangel: bertrand_afk: k
13:50  timing_: uhm, the banners are probably hosted on a different server? so it's crossdomain?
13:51  timing_: google analytics works with iframe ( or object, not sure )
13:52  greg_f: timing_: yes, banners storage is different server
13:52  Vorspire: (timing_): i think you're missing my point... jQuery -> AJAX -> Local PHP -> cURL -> Ad Data
13:53  Vorspire: use jQuery-AJAX to load a Local PHP file that uses cURL or fsockopen to retrieve http data
13:53  Vorspire: thus cross-domain ajax is born ;P
13:53  Vienzzion: wa? where?
13:54  Vienzzion: o
13:54  Vorspire: you get what i'm saying? :P
13:54  greg_f: Vorspire: I use python for server side. Thanks any more!
13:55  Vorspire: Well then just use Python's urllib to get remote page data and return it as HTML, XML or JSON, then call your Python file with jQuery-AJAX
13:55  greg_f: thanks
13:55  Vorspire: np :)
13:56  Vienzzion: np
13:56  doonie: so why do browsers try to stop crossdomain when there are other ways around it
13:58  Vorspire: (doonie): it's unsafe for the javascript to run inside the browser process (that's how it works) but it's much safer for the webserver to handle the PHP to retrieve the external data, where it doesn't run in the browser

14:01  StevenTyler: is there a way to get the hex value instead of rgb(179, 0, 179) for color value?
14:01  Hex_101: HEX
14:01  Hex_101: oh.
14:01 * Hex_101 walks away
14:02  hyperstream: Hey guys, im having trouble with this selector, for some reason its not firing:(description+code example) http://pastebin.com/6Ru6zWai
14:02  hyperstream: If anyone could perhaps explain why its not working, that would be great
14:03  Imek: is there no setting for a jQuery UI dialog to have it fixed-position, i.e. not moving up/down when the user scrolls the page?
14:04  Imek: or do I have to set position to fixed and position it manually with .css()
14:04  Vorspire: Imek what about Modal Dialog?
14:05  Cork: Imek: you have to set the css
14:05  Imek: the ones I have are modal, doesn't seem to make a difference
14:05  Cork: it doens't
14:05  Imek: ok then, thanks anyway
14:06  Vorspire: I thought modal dialogs stopped behind-page interaction, including scrolling etc?
14:06  doonie: some do
14:06  Cork: Vorspire: all jquery ui dialogs are position absolute
14:06  Cork: Vorspire: the screen is fixed though
14:06  Vorspire: *nod*
14:07  Vorspire: haven't had the opportunity to use dialogs yet ^^
14:07  Vorspire: hope that will come soon
14:07 * Cork has an interface that dynamically create dialogs :)
14:07  Cork: so i know the beast farly well :)
14:07  Vorspire: sweet
14:08  Cork: i had to build an extension to it to be able to build the window interface i have
14:08  Vorspire: did you manage to create a decent win7 look and feel? :D
14:08  Cork: (menus, taskbar, minimize, maximize, close, zindexing focus and so on)
14:08  Cork: Vorspire: heh hw acceleration is still a bit to far into the future :)
14:09  Vorspire: if you noticed my code in the index earlier, it has .desktop(); ? - That was the initial plan for that site, got half way then decided it was an unfortunate design plan for the usage of the site
14:09  Cork: Vorspire: but in development versions of chrome, firefox and ie9 it should be posible :)
14:10  Vorspire: well, I was thinking about just creating a jquery-ui theme called win7 :P
14:10  Vorspire: rip out the graphics
14:10  Cork: Vorspire: i've created an os feal for the site (a control panel)
14:10  Vorspire: respect :)
14:10  Cork: not really
14:10  Cork: its more js then html though :)
14:11  Vorspire: yea I bet :P
14:11  Cork: about 13000 lins js and 200 html :D
14:11  Cork: and most of the html is for product cards
14:11  Cork: the page only need about 17-20 lines of html :D
14:12  Vorspire: lol
14:12  Vorspire: the layout :D
14:12  Cork: Vorspire: no more like a boot loaded
14:12  Vorspire: lol
14:12  Cork: html, header, load all the js, a html "you need js" or "your browser is to old"
14:12  Cork: the rest is js
14:12  Vorspire: (Cork): do you have any C# experience?
14:12  Vorspire: (Cork[home]): do you have any C# experience?
14:12  Vorspire: omg lol
14:13  Cork: Vorspire: some, but i prefer to stay away from that language
14:13  Vorspire: ahh, why so?
14:13  Cork: Vorspire: its just a new take on java...
14:13  unfo-: lol
14:14  Vorspire: It's my main language btw :D
14:14  unfo-: <3 maybe but >=3.0 is a much better language than java
14:14  unfo-: the language actually is being developed and released ;)
14:14  Cork: either go script (ruby, perl, python, php) or compile (c, c++, asm, go)
14:14  Cork: i don't see the need for .net
14:14  Vorspire: I wasn't referring to ASP.NET though, I mean C# in general context, Application Programming, etc
14:15  hyperstream: If anyone here is decent with messy dynamic selectors, could you please take a look at http://pastebin.com/rBi3tqCY
14:15  Cork: Vorspire: # is .net :)
14:15  unfo-: .net > asp.net :)
14:16  nlogax: you can use a lot of different languages on .net, including python and ruby
14:16  zmijunkie: Vorspire - seems to understand the same arguments, but doesn't look as nice on my mobile - I was expecting it to look somehow like this: http://scr3.golem.de/screenshots/1008/jQuery-Mobile/jquery-mobile-smartphone-11aug20102.png
14:16  Vorspire: Yes, but you can't write Web-Server software with PHP, HTML, etc, which is why I disticted C# from ASP.NET :D
14:16  Cork: hyperstream: wow... you need to split that up into some variables XD
14:16  Vorspire: lmao
14:16  Cork: its almost inreadble...
14:16  Cork: *unreadble
14:16  nlogax: they can/are all compiled though, what do you think those .pyc files are?
14:17  hyperstream: Cork, it alerts the correct value, but chucking it inside of $().scroll(function() { }); it wont fire
14:17  Vorspire: (nlogax): I wrote a C# compiler in C# ^^
14:17  Cork: hyperstream: i didn't joke.. you REALLY need to split that up a bit, its imposible to follow the code
14:17  nlogax: Vorspire: that's the spirit :)
14:18  hyperstream: Cork, split how so? i cant pre set any of them, its needs to select what ever is scrolling, that is active(multiple windows)
14:18  Vorspire: (nlogax): http://webserverlite.codeplex.com
14:18  Cork: hyperstream: put at least some of the selectors into variables
14:19  hyperstream: Cork, just for code reviewing purposes?
14:19  Cork: hyperstream: then use the variable instead of the selector
14:19  Cork: hyperstream: no for code readability, you sould never squash your code like that
14:19  hyperstream: Cork, i cant preset any variables...
14:19  Cork: you will go mad in say 6 month when you need to parse that line again
14:19  thinkt4nk: is there a way of displaying an object's hierarchy like php does with print_r or var_dump ?
14:20  thinkt4nk: with jquery
14:20  khinester: on this code http://pastie.org/1232455 how do i reset line 17 so that if the loop is re-run it removes this value - what is the function to reset the form if a user puts the cursor into the input field?
14:20  Cork: thinkt4nk: there is a var_dump implementation for javascript :)
14:20  thinkt4nk: DOPE!  thanks
14:20  hyperstream: Cork, is there some sort of before firing scroll() event?
14:20  Cork: thinkt4nk: or you can just use console.log
14:21  Cork: hyperstream: no
14:21  hyperstream: Cork, where i could preset these
14:21  hyperstream: Cork, im not sure how im suposed to go about presetting them ?
14:21  thinkt4nk: thanks a lot cork
14:22  Beam: is there any way to have some code run on each matched element as they're loaded into dom?
14:22  Beam: so page doesn't show incorrectly while loading
14:23  peder: is there an easy way to skip doing a click event, lets say on a tr when the element clicked has event bound already? typically links and inputs and such
14:23  Vorspire: what would the second event be, peder?
14:24  Vorspire: the already-bound event(s)
14:24  peder: Vorspire: yes, i don't want the event on the tr do do anything if any childelement in the tr has its own click-event
14:25  Cork: peder: set event.stopPropagation in your child elements event
14:25  Cork: that will prevent the event from bubbeling up to the tr
14:26  peder: Cork: well... when that event is a default one, like activating a href or entering an input-element, that is a bit hard...
14:26  Cork: peder: why so?
14:27  Cork: peder: you can check if the target element is the tr, but that won't work in ie
14:27  Cork: so the simplest way is to either reuse a click or mousemove or what ever event you want to stop, or if you don't have one, add a new one
14:28  Cork: and prevent the bubbeling up through the tree
14:28  peder: let me claryify with an example.  i have a table, with lots of trs each containing a checkbox, lots of static text and a link.
14:29  peder: what i want to do is to toggle the checkbox when you click anywhere in the tr, but not get in the way of the link and the checkbox
14:29  Cork: peder: $('table tr a').click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
14:30 --- cna_ is now known as cna
14:30  BMCouto: anyone into jquery mobile?
14:31  peder: Cork: ok, but then i have to do that for every link, input and whatnot that has a click-event in the table, and that defeats the purpose of using $("table").delegate('tr', 'click', ...) a bit
14:32  Cork: peder: you need to stop the event before you get to the tr, or in another way remove it
14:32  Vorspire: one or the other :P or each
14:32  Cork: peder: as far as i know, there is only two ways to do it
14:32  Cork: either with target element, but that doesn't work in ie
14:32  Cork: or by stoping the event from bubbeling
14:33  peder: Cork: so no way of checking in the delegate-handler if anthing else has fired before it?
14:33  Famic_: hi
14:33  Vorspire: e.propogationStopped; ?
14:34  Cork: peder: i don't know the inner workings of delegate to answer that
14:34  Vorspire: http://api.jquery.com/event.isPropagationStopped/
14:34  Cork: Vorspire: that would still need the other event
14:34  Famic_: anyone knows if there is an easy way to clone a bunch of html and rename all id/name/for fields ? I want to clone part of a form and add _1 _2 etc
14:35  Cork: peder: i think deligate works the same as live, and if so it adds it self to a parent element, and then you don't know who triggers first
14:36  Vorspire: ?clone @ Famic_
14:36  bot-t: Famic_, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
14:36  peder: Cork: yes, it binds to the table-element in the example above... so tou don't need to bind on every tr in the table (useful for dynamic tables)
14:36 --- chia_ is now known as chia
14:36  Famic_: Vorspire: yeah, the cloning part is the easy one...
14:36  Famic_: but renaming all name/id/for ?
14:38  peder: .find('*[id]').each(function(){ $(this).attr('id', $(this).attr('id')+'_'+counter++) }); ?
14:38  peder: or maybe not the ++ part...

14:39  peder: Famic_: not sure if it works, bu that would be what i would start with :)
14:39  Vorspire: .each(function(counter){ ... })
14:39  Vorspire: use the each's index as the counter to avoid the ++ incriment
14:40  Vorspire: (peder): that code looks sound
14:40  peder: Vorspire: i guess Famic_ would increment the counter for each clone, not each id/name/for
14:40  Famic_: peder: indeed :)
14:40  Vorspire: fair :)
14:41  Vorspire: I would scope it and add local variables tbh
14:44  FLX99: I'm using a cms that is currently binding the "B" key to a function

16:34  miketaylr: a jQuery object?
16:34  ben_alman: "a jquery collection object" ?

16:34  Prometheus: ben_alman: a collection?
16:35  ben_alman: i guess what do we call $ and what do we call what $() returns

16:35  l4rk: atula: typeof isn't a function!!!
16:35  rmurphey: what's up?
16:35  atula: heh. it returns 'object'
16:35  rmurphey: ben_alman:
16:35  ben_alman: it's A function but what do we call it? $ = THE jQuery Object, not to be confused with what $() returns, which is A jQuery Object?

16:37  atula: if you're allergic to "array" then a list of object
16:38  l4rk: a generic collection, the collection itself never has the specific class's methods on the collection, its inside the iterables.  jquery has them on the collection which is awesome because you can then run methods on everything inside the collection, so its more than just a collection
16:38  kojiro: ben_alman: it's just that, "The character that is often mistaken to be a Javascript sigil" is not obscure enough. :(
16:38  ben_alman: $() returns an array-like object that at its core is a collection of object references plus jQuery "chainable" methods
16:39  ben_alman: etc
16:39  Prometheus: ben_alman: are you writing a book? =)
16:39  l4rk: yeah but thats unique imo instead of just a vanilla array

18:00  webguy024: I tried using the UI 1.8.5 in jsfiddle but there is no draggable in it.
18:00  ajpiano: maxfreeze, yeah exactly, the days of the week are random for the purposes of this example
18:00  ajpiano: justto show you it working
18:00  maxfreeze: :)
18:00  maxfreeze: nice
18:00  ajpiano: webguy024, there is definitely draggable in jqueryui 1.8.5

18:16  Dykotomee: Basically, if I have a DDL of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'Other...'], when "Other..." is selected, I want a TextBox to appear to allow for users to enter their own value.
18:16  ejb: ajpiano: thanks! any idea about that error? ^
18:16  akahn: stoned: read the learning jquery blog
18:16  Dykotomee: I'm sure this isn't hard to do, but if somebody's done it already, what's the point in reinventing the wheel?
18:17  ejb: ajpiano: nvm, it was bc I was using the wrong version
18:17  pifantastic: Dykotomee: it's simple enough it's actually probably easier for you to do
18:17 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 95 seconds
18:17  pifantastic: Dykotomee: you need an <input> field that is hidden with CSS
18:17  pifantastic: and a change() handler for the DDL
18:17  stoned: i needed .append
18:17  stoned: thanks
18:17  Dykotomee: OK. I was looking for a generic function.
18:18  Dykotomee: Something like $('#myDDL').applyOther({/*params*/});
18:18  ajpiano: ejb: window.location.href = "/join";
18:18  pifantastic: $("#myDDL").change(function() { $("#input").show(); });

18:20  danheberden: hey guys, i need a plugin like this: $('#element').performalAllCrudFunctionsAutomatically({ /* stuff */ });
18:20  stoned: whats the event for when a person leaves the textbox
18:20  danheberden: ?blur
18:20  stoned: either with mouse or with keyborad
18:20  bot-t: .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
18:20  Dykotomee: Wow, that's a heck of a lot easier than I was making it.
18:20  Do``: Vorspire: bertrand_afk has a different version which has rolling average speed calculation in it. i'm not sure if that's a better solution. what do you think?
18:20  stoned: haha
18:20  stoned: aptly named
18:20  ejb: My dialog doesn't seem to be themed... Is there another file I need to include for that?
18:21  ajpiano: ejb: you have to include the various css files that came with your UI distro
18:21  ejb: ajpiano: are those on google's CDN?
18:21  Vorspire: Do`` I could impliment average speed into the plugin I'm developing
18:21  ajpiano: ejb: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
18:22  Dykotomee: pifantastic: Thanks!
18:22  pifantastic: Dykotomee: np
18:22  Do``: Vorspire: right, but i just don't see a case where that would perform better than a regular version without rolling average
18:23  Vorspire: Do``, it depends on the code used tbf

18:32  EyePulp: is there a way to get the version of jquery ui from the console?  I'm loading it via script tags, but my calls to .button() are erroring as though ui isn't loading - just trying to verify it's loaded somehow
18:33  prgmrBill: EyePulp: you can determine it's loaded by looking at the error
18:33  sabitertan: hi
18:33  trobrock: I am trying to use the change event on the jQuery UI autocomplete, but it seems the event on fires after focus is removed from the text field
18:34  sabitertan: can anyone help me i want to callback a variable like  $("input#(katQty)") katQty is a variable
18:35  EyePulp: prgmrBill: yeahhhh...  "$('#some_known_valid_id').button() is not a function" makes me thing it's not loaded, though $.ui from the console shows me it is.
18:35  sabitertan: how can i add this in there
18:35  ajpiano: $("#"+katQty)
18:35  ajpiano: EyePulp: is $.ui.button defined
18:36  prgmrBill: EyePulp: it matters where in the code you try to do that. if you're loading all of your JS just before the closing body tag you should be fine
18:36  EyePulp: ajpiano:  just looked - comes back as a function() in the console
18:36  ajpiano: and $.ui.buttonset ?
18:36  EyePulp: function()
18:37  nvictor: when i use http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
18:37  nvictor: do i get ui, etc?
18:37  ajpiano: are you loading the lib before you call button()
18:37  ajpiano: nope
18:37  ajpiano: you get the core lib
18:37  yonk: can i send and array with getJSON?
18:37  yonk: an array*
18:38  EyePulp: ajpiano: I think you & prgrmr bill must be right, that it's a timing issue, except I'm not launching the .button() call until after core & ui are done loading.
18:38  nvictor: ajpiano: how do i get the ui then?
18:38 * EyePulp adds a console call for $.ui.button right before the .button() call
18:39  khinester: i get this warning in FF but Chrome does not show this 'The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless.' here is the code http://pastie.org/1233071 what goes on?

18:39  nvictor: ajpiano: thanks
18:39  nvictor: ajpiano: also
18:39  danheberden: khinester: use keyCode
18:39  Dykotomee: khinester: Isn't it keyCode?
18:39  Dykotomee: Yeah.
18:39  ajpiano: nvictor you also need the css for ui, http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
18:39  nvictor: ajpiano: <script src="jquery.dimensions.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
18:40  ajpiano: nvictor you don't need the dimensions plugin since jquery 1.2.6
18:40  khinester: where?
18:40  nvictor: ajpiano: ok
18:40  nvictor: ajpiano: not sure i even need the css file
18:40  danheberden: ah i see what you're using khinester

18:40  ajpiano: Posted on 18th February 2008
18:41  ManxPower: Is there something similar to $(this).find('> td:nth-child(1) > a').attr('href') that would allow me to name the column by name/id/class instead of by number?
18:41  sabitertan: ajpiano :thanks
18:41  ManxPower: i.e instead of nth-child(1) something like .mobile
18:41  yonk: How i can send an array with getJSON ?
18:42  ajpiano: ManxPower, if you put the class .mobile on the elements , then you can select them by that class
18:42  Kindari|work: how could i scroll to a #id
18:42  ajpiano: yonk: you can .join() the array and send it as a string, or use see ?stringify
18:42  bot-t: yonk, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (http://json.org/json2.js) to provide a fallback. jQuery does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
18:42  ajpiano: ?scrollTo @ Kindari|work
18:42  bot-t: Kindari|work, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
18:42  ManxPower: ajpiano, yes, but I don't want to select the entire column, just the cell on this row in that column
18:43  ajpiano: ?scrollTo @ Kindari|work right... and what is preventing you from doing that
18:43  trobrock: the autocomplete in UI has an event called change, should this event wait for the text box to lose focus?
18:43  ajpiano: whoops

18:43  devinrolsen: in firefox this ajax script gets posted just fine, however in IE it always error:'s out.. anyone see something I might not be? http://pastebin.com/KwFK406M
18:43  ajpiano: ManxPower, what is preventing you from doing that
18:43  yonk: thanks ajpiano and bot-t
18:43  bot-t: yonk, I'm a bot you know..
18:44  ajpiano: devinrolsen are you manually concatenating together a JSON STRING
18:44  ajpiano: as your data object??
18:44  ManxPower: ajpiano, from what I read $(this).find('> td:.mobile > a').attr('href') would give me an array of all cells in the column mobile.
18:44  ajpiano: also known as ARE YOU INSANE
18:44  ajpiano: ManxPower, not if $(this) is already a tr
18:44  devinrolsen: lol was not originally written by me
18:44  ajpiano: ManxPower, also just use $(this).children("td.mobile")
18:44  ajpiano: if you  just want children and not all descendants
18:44  ajpiano: oh
18:44  ajpiano: but you want a of that
18:44  ajpiano: but yeah, td.mobile, not td:.mobile
18:45  ManxPower: ajpiano, the next part is how do I specify a class for an entire column?  <col class="mobile" />
18:45  devinrolsen: so you think the problem lives in the JSON string?
18:45  ajpiano: ManxPower,  when you render the table on the server side, put a column on the class
18:45  ajpiano: put a class on the column i mean
18:45  ManxPower: ajpiano, $(this) is a tr
18:45  devinrolsen: I dont know what is going on sever side, so I assume they waiting for the string to be in JSON format (aspx)
18:45  ajpiano: devinrolsen, well it's fucking insane to do that
18:45  ajpiano: that way
18:46  devinrolsen: yeah I personally never use JSON for ajax requests like this
18:46  ManxPower: ajpiano, I'll give it a try.  thanks.
18:46  devinrolsen: so I already feel like its insane hehe
18:46  ajpiano: it's fine to send JSON, just to manually stringify it is ridiculous
18:46  yonk: ajpiano, but how exactly: $.getJSON(mirror+'?peticion_json', {'datos': arr.join(), 'ok' : true }, function(data){ } ); ?
18:46  nvictor: so
18:46  ajpiano: yonk: try that and see
18:46  ManxPower: the only thing jSON has ever done for me is waste hours of my time barfing on quotes
18:46  nvictor: there is a difference betweeb $(window).ready() and $(document).ready() ?/
18:47  ajpiano: nvictor, one is right the other is wrong
18:47  nvictor: ajpiano: which one?
18:47  ajpiano: $(document) is right
18:47  nvictor: ajpiano: but the tutorial uses $(window) ...

18:53  quicksilver: chaining .attr is easier to read than lots of javascript '"' and +

18:54  stoned: ahahha
18:54  stoned: nice
18:54  Brodingo: quicksilver++
18:54  danheberden: quciksilver, easier to do $('<img />', { src: A_JS_VAR })

18:55  quicksilver: danheberden: I didn't know you could do that.

19:31  MatthewG: Dykotomee: hm, that would help :) it's just a div with a link and a ul
19:31  danheberden: and you cant use class names because....
19:31  Dykotomee: Yeah, that's what's getting me.
19:31  LCCX: Why does alert($(this).className) result in "undefined"? The jQueryUI slider has classes as well as an id and I am having trouble getting them out.
19:32  Dykotomee: Use classes instead of IDs to reference your elements.
19:32  MatthewG: danheberden / Dykotomee - uh, that's a no brainer.
19:32 * MatthewG blushes and does
19:32  danheberden: whew
19:32  Dykotomee: Orrrr...if you're simply using divs with NOTHING but an a & a ul, just use simple selectors.
19:32  danheberden: was afraid of seeing $('#firstdiv, #seconddiv, #thirddiv')
19:32  danheberden: and then was gonna cry
19:32  ajpiano: LCCX: this.className or $(this).attr("class")
19:32  Dykotomee: And use a class to ID each div.
19:33 --- Yvemath_ is now known as Yvemath
19:33  LCCX: Which "this" would
19:34  LCCX: Which "this" would this apply to, compared to $(this) -- which I understand to be the active object.
19:34  Dykotomee: Hence: $('div.MyDropDownDiv a').whatever, $('div.MyDropDownDiv ul').whatever.
19:34 --- danheberden is now known as burden
19:35 --- meenpeter is now known as bentruyman
19:35  Dykotomee: LCCX: I believe "this" is the active DOM element, while "$(this)" is the jQuerified active DOM element.
19:36  LCCX: Oi, great! I'll try that and I hope it works. This might be what I was looking for.
19:36  ajpiano: ^^
19:40  jgn: Hi, I'm a confused one
19:40  jgn:     $("#submissionButton").click(function(){
19:40  jgn:         $('#triggerFormElement').submit(function(){ alert('pooh'); return true;});
19:40  jgn: doesn't alert for me
19:41  jgn: any ideas?  triggerFormElement is just a form element, named trigger because it is the triggerform
19:41  jgn: nothing to do with triggering events
19:42  jgn: I'm only trying to do validation on my form when I hit submit
19:43  jgn: this is all inside a document.ready(function(){
19:44  Dykotomee: Is there a CSS selector that matches the parent node?
19:44  Dykotomee: I know there isn't one for CSS, but I'm looking to get around calling $('whatever').parent() all the time.
19:45  ajpiano: Dykotomee, why
19:45  ajpiano: if there is some OTHER way to do it
19:45  ajpiano: you'll just be doing THAT all the time
19:45  MatthewG: Dykotomee: hm, with classes, I do something like this: $('.dropdown-link').click( function(){ $('.dropdown').slideToggle('slow') } ) - right?
19:45  ajpiano: if you already have a dom element reference, you can do elem.parentNode
19:45  Dykotomee: Why not? Another chained function as opposed to selecting everything right in the text.
19:45  Dykotomee: Mostly for legibility.
19:46  ajpiano: wel, there isn't
19:46  Dykotomee: But if .parent()'s the way to go, that's fine too.
19:46  ajpiano: there's a :parent selector but it selects elements that *are parents*
19:46  Dykotomee: Eh. Not quite what I'm looking for.
19:46  burden: but really, the markup should be better architectured
19:46  Dykotomee: So basically, anything that isn't a leaf.
19:47  Dykotomee: MatthewG: It depends on your code.
19:47  Dykotomee: Or rather, your markup.
19:47  Dykotomee: Could you paste EXACTLY the section you want to jQuerify?
19:47  MatthewG: Dykotomee: I guess that's how you select a class. Strange, this isn't working. /me pastebins
19:48  MatthewG: Dykotomee: http://pastebin.com/QVMPFEfp - thank you. It was working with IDs ... very weird
19:48  jgn: ah it seems to have been a cache issue for me
19:49  ajpiano: MatthewG: you know about chaining right bro
19:49  MatthewG: ajpiano: hm, negative. /me learnin' the jquery ropes
19:49  ajpiano: it's REALLY REALLY BAD to do $(".foo") $(".foo") $(".foo") over and over again
19:49  ajpiano: it is a complete waste of time
19:50  ajpiano: so you should either do $(".foo").bar().baz()
19:50  Dykotomee: Yeah, set a var or chain.
19:50  ajpiano: or var foo = $(".foo");  foo.bar().baz()
19:50  burden: var = $foo
19:50  ajpiano: MatthewG, also... why don't you just have both of those things take place in the same event
19:50  MatthewG: actually... I just realized I have $('.dropdown-link').click( function(){  ... twice.
19:50  Dykotomee: Did you know you have an extra </div>?
19:50  MatthewG: haha
19:50  ajpiano: binding two click events to the same element...
19:50  ajpiano: yeah
19:50  LCCX: Awesome!! I now have a function that fits into sliders' slide() and change() to duplicate the handles' values to associated text boxes. :) Thanks ajpiano!
19:50 * MatthewG does
19:51  MatthewG: hm, Dykotomee - will do, but any reason why this isn't working? (extra div might have been from bad paste
19:51  Dykotomee: Looking now...
19:51 * MatthewG makes this more concise
19:51  MatthewG: seems like it would work
19:52  stoned: is it possible to eat the first click ?
19:52  stoned: does that make sense
19:53  stoned: say you click something and you want nothing to happen, but if you click again, you want something to happen
19:53  stoned: just setup a counter?
19:53  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Get rid of the semicolon in the css value, it's not necessary.
19:53  burden: stoned, for that a boolean would be good, but ya
19:54  MatthewG: Dykotomee: hm, that's right
19:54  ajpiano: stoned: you can use .one() or you can use .toggle()
19:54  Dykotomee: This works for me: http://www.jsfiddle.net/nDxb5/1/
19:54  burden: ajpiano: he wants to run notOne
19:54  Dykotomee: If it's not working for you, then you need to fix your setup.
19:54  stoned: ajpiano, hm
19:55  stoned: ok
19:55  MatthewG: Dykotomee: hmph, thank you. /me investigates
19:55  Dykotomee: :)
19:55  ajpiano: burden: $("#foo").one("click",function() { $(this).click(function() {  alert("this will happen on ever click but the first");  }); })
19:55  k1ng: please recommend me a movie... i am bored :(
19:55  webguy024: k1ng do you have netflix on demand?
19:55  burden: but you're doing more work in making two event handleres
19:55  burden: then you are tracking a simple boolean
19:55  burden: ^^
19:56  ajpiano: truf
19:56  Dykotomee: ajpiano: Won't that append multiple alerts after each click?
19:56  burden: but extra points for bad-ass style bro
19:56  ajpiano: nope
19:56  burden: yes
19:56  burden: haha
19:56  k1ng: webguy024, no
19:56 --- pubsub is now known as ralphholzmann
19:56  ajpiano: Dykotomee the very idea of an alert being appended... doesn't even make sense
19:56  Dykotomee: # of alerts = # of clicks - 1
19:56  MatthewG: Dykotomee: hm, what in my set up could break this, I wonder?
19:57  ajpiano: nope, read what the .one() fn does
19:57  Dykotomee: No, but there will be multiple events.
19:57  Dykotomee: Ahh.
19:57  Dykotomee: Missed that ".one" - haha
19:57  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Go for something simpler.
19:57  webguy024: anyway the King of Kong is a great documentary on breaking the Donkey Kong record score, if you are interested in a good flic k1ng
19:58  Dykotomee: Try alert($('.down').html());
19:58  k1ng: wth?

19:58  MatthewG: Dykotomee: ah, I got it. The <!-- and --> was marking it as a comment in <head> err.. lame
19:58  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Also, do you need to include jquery UI?
19:59  stoned: ajpiano, Chose your own
19:59  stoned: ajpiano, please
19:59  ajpiano: what
19:59  ajpiano: i really don't want to add facebook apps
19:59  ajpiano: lol
19:59  stoned: ajpiano, type word in the input and don't click ok, just click anywhere to make a blur event
19:59  stoned: just help me test it out
19:59  stoned: please
19:59  Prometheus: oh my god..
19:59  stoned: you can remove it
19:59  MatthewG: Dykotomee: nah, have that. Ok, so, classes work - but the issue now is I have 2 of the drop downs. When I click on one, they both drop down
19:59  Prometheus: stoned: please don't do that here either
19:59  Dykotomee: MatthewG: lol
20:00  stoned: what?
20:00 --- flux23|away is now known as flux23
20:00  Dykotomee: Then you didn't paste ALL of your markup.
20:00  MatthewG: Dykotomee: yeah, I just added it to a second one :) /me does
20:00  stoned: prometheus, what are you talking about?
20:00  Dykotomee: Grr, hold on...
20:00  mahen23: quickly, give me a jquery CDN
20:00  Prometheus: stoned: advertising your app, asking people to test it =)

20:01  burden: emphasis on demo
20:01  stoned: thats just wrong.
20:01  Prometheus: it's not wrong
20:01  Prometheus: it's wrong for you to ask people to install your app =)
20:01  stoned: Yes it is because you're slandering my name like this.
20:01  ElGoorf: question, im trying to add a proceduarlly generated list, so that when the user clicks an item, it triggers an action specific to that item in the list, but at the moment when a user clicks it triggers the action for all of the items: http://pastebin.com/6vr4f2Ba
20:01  stoned: Shame on you.
20:01  burden: this is not a democracy
20:01  Prometheus: slandering your name?
20:01  Prometheus: lol.
20:02  stoned: If you have a problem with it, deal with it yourself.
20:02 * Prometheus is taken Business Law right now, please don't talk to me about slander.
20:02  stoned: There is NO way for me to show the fucntionality of the jquery quesiton I'm asking
20:02  Prometheus: taking*
20:02  stoned: other than yourself looking at the actual app.
20:02  Prometheus: stoned: sure there is
20:02  ajpiano: ElGoorf, you're creating a lot of global vars bro
20:02  ajpiano: Prometheus: stoned SHH
20:02  stoned: What is it?
20:02  Prometheus: stubs, mock data
20:02  ajpiano: SHH
20:02  ajpiano: SHH
20:02  ajpiano: no one cares shh
20:02  MatthewG: Dykotomee: I think I'm going to have to have multiple ids and not classes, unless you have a better idea
20:02  Prometheus: ajpiano: don't be an ass
20:02  burden: bot-t, can i get some ops?
20:02  bot-t: burden, Cannot predict now.
20:02  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Try this: http://www.jsfiddle.net/nDxb5/3/
20:02  ajpiano: i promise no one needs to read you guys have this argument
20:02  Dykotomee: I did it in 1 line of code.
20:02  Prometheus: k
20:02  stoned: I'm asking for support and I'm getting attacked and I'm trying to explain my question and I'm being told to fscking shush?
20:03  stoned: seriously?
20:03  ElGoorf: ajpiano,  im aware of this, its quite a big experiment im doing and im quite noob to js
20:03  stoned: *sigh*
20:03  MatthewG: Dykotomee: heh, call me a noob. thanks /me investigates what you did
20:03 * webguy024 agrees
20:03  ajpiano: ElGoorf, just use var id, var name etc.
20:03  ElGoorf: but im workign on it, i did a massive tidy up last night and removed about 75% of the globals :D
20:03  stoned: ajpiano, prometheus started the argument and the trolling.
20:03 --- flux23 is now known as flux23|away
20:03  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Of course, this assumes that all of your markup is set up with a div/ul pairing, one right after the other.
20:04  Dykotomee: You place anything in between and the code barfs.
20:04  ajpiano: yeah i know but you're engaging with him and then i said to stop talking about it cause it's boring as hell and now i have to type it and my fingers are aching from all this typing OUCH
20:04  ElGoorf: ajpiano, is that relevant to my problem?
20:04  stoned: ajpiano, please keep it in mind. Now if there is a way for me to show you my app's jquery question, without someone arguing about installing it on FB then please, tell me.
20:04  burden: great, you guys made ajpiano grumpy
20:04  stoned: But this petty attack on 'advertising' is quite inflammatory and very much not needed.
20:04  Dykotomee: burden: not good for visitors.
20:05  stoned: How can I show my questions's demo?
20:05  ajpiano: you can make a live demo that emulates the problem without requireing people to install a fb app
20:05  stoned: ok
20:05  MatthewG: Dykotomee: yup, that's how it is. although, a quick paste and it didn't work. hah *investigates
20:05  stoned: ajpiano, thankfully you're more reasonable and have more social skills. Word.
20:05  Dykotomee: stoned: Go to godaddy.com, register www.hereismyfacebookdemonowlook.com, load up your website, and have people look.
20:05  mahen23: damm,  i hate it that i still have to look at the docs to write (document).ready() :(
20:06  Dykotomee: MatthewG: Yeah, like I said, it depends on the markup.
20:06  burden: mahen23: it'll become like a second language, and js will permeate into your dreams
20:06  burden: i speak from experience on that one ;)
20:06  stoned: And it isn't my app, I don't gain or lose anything. I simply get paid to code. Please keep that in mind.
20:06  stoned: jeez.
20:07  Dykotomee: mahen23: $(function() { }) works too.
20:07  stoned: people and thier militant hatred of social media... mindless.
20:07  stoned: ok im done venting.
20:07  burden: although $(document).ready( is much more readable code
20:07  mahen23: burden: its not like i work with jquery everyday, but its still shameful for me :(
20:07  burden: i recommend that because $(function() { looks too similar to a closure
20:07  stoned: mahen23, dude
20:07  stoned: mahen23, whats the problem?
20:08  burden: heh - well you got a bitchin' api mahen23 so worry not :)
20:08  stoned: mahen23, i am new too, but its not hard, jquery make sthings amazingly easy
20:08  stoned: like you have no idea
20:08  stoned: looking at jquery is nice. looking at stright js is eye cancer.
20:08  MatthewG: Dykotomee: heh, extra } ... fixed.
20:08  mahen23: stoned: i was talking to burden why are you even talking to me?
20:08  burden: straight js is beautiful
20:08  stoned: mahen23, because I can.
20:08  burden: the dom, THATs the ugly bitch
20:08  Dykotomee: MatthewG: It's always the "missing semicolon." :)
20:08  stoned: mahen23, you can stop me with /ignore. Have at it. :)
20:09  mahen23: oh shaddap and let me code
20:09 * mahen23 looks away
20:09  stoned: its ok dude. relax.
20:09  stoned: don't let this shit get the best of you
20:09  stoned: you're THE human. these are machiens. you pwnz them.
20:09  Prometheus: nvictor: turns out that quirksmode snippet didn't work too well with IE7, so I just went the easy route and included minified jquery =P
20:10  burden: ok - everyone - can we please keep the comments down? the topic is jquery, not highschool drama. don't reply, don't keep going - take a breath, calm down and lets get back on topic
20:10  burden: PLEASE
20:10  Prometheus: just ignore them if it's a problem

20:10  bot-t: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
20:11  Prometheus: seriously, don't bitch about it
20:11  stoned: *sigh*
20:11  burden: i've earned my bitching rights
20:11  ajpiano: stoned: it's not mindless hatred of social media, it's that requiring people to install an app an go through all those hoops when you could provide a live demo on jsfiddle, which is standard operating procedure for this channel, would be better
20:11  ajpiano: by the same token
20:11  stoned: wtf is a jsfiddle
20:11  ajpiano: Prometheus: you don't really need to like come in and be all self-righteous about administartive channel stuff, we pretty much got that taken care of
20:11  stoned: nm.
20:11  Dykotomee: stoned: An instrument.
20:11  Prometheus: ajpiano: no worries, just airing my opinion
20:12  stoned: prometheus, ouch! BURN!
20:12  ajpiano: kk
20:12  stoned: prometheus, now how does it feel to be on the ASS end of a comment?
20:12  stoned: :)
20:12  Prometheus: stoned: you are not worth my time buddy, I'm not going to bother =)
20:12  stoned: ajpiano, jsfiddle is like a pastebin + codepad for js
20:12  stoned: prometheus, apparently you are.
20:12  ajpiano: yep
20:12  stoned: ha, talk about irc drama makers.
20:13  stoned: ajpiano, codepad is also good but it has no client side
20:13  stoned: wow jsfiddle is freaking awesome
20:13  stoned: but i figured out my problem
20:13  mahen23: WE ALL SUCK as web developers, who agrees?
20:13  stoned: I was advised the wrong event (mostly because I probably didn't ask the right question)
20:14  stoned: its ok. I got it fixed
20:14  stoned: life is a blast.
20:14  stoned: mahen23, im 1 year into web development
20:14  mahen23: i am nothing without my coffee and my coffee is nothing without me

20:15  stoned: mahen23, i don't depend on chemicals to make me feel godo
20:15  stoned: *ahem*
20:15  stoned: ok I'm out.
20:16  mahen23: i bought that book from sitepoint: jquery from novice to Ninja
20:16  mahen23: well what a waste of money
20:16  Dykotomee: mahen23: I learned everything I know about jQuery from that book.
20:17  burden: I'd recommend javascript, the good parts by douglas crockford
20:17  stoned: its not the book thats the problem
20:17  mahen23: in this time of googlefu, its faster to run a query that shuffling through the pages
20:17  stoned: its individual brain capacity.
20:17  stoned: cognitive ability
20:17  stoned: ability to reason and larn new things
20:17  Dykotomee: stoned: Well, yeah, that plays a role too I suppose. :)
20:17  stoned: not everyone is the same.
20:17  stoned: also
20:17  stoned: not everyone learns the same way
20:18  stoned: that book might have really been ineffective for him
20:18  mahen23: stoned: where did you learn to be so philoshophical?
20:18  stoned: I have three degress, two honors.
20:18  mahen23: stoned: is tha the beer or the caffeein talking?
20:18  stoned: I went to school like a good little nerd.
20:18  stoned: its the pot talking.
20:18  hobs: it isnt beer or caffiene
20:18  hobs: obviously
20:18  ner0x: What could cause a jquery-ui button not to stay in "active state" if it's a buttonset?
20:18  hobs: edit: beaten
20:20  mahen23: yesterday i bought this big jar of blended coffee and everyone was like: omg so much, you gonna die from an overdose"
20:20  mahen23: the hell is their problem?
20:21  stoned: they are idiots
20:21  stoned: they thing you're going to drink it all in one sitting...
20:21  stoned: or a few... or really just try to drink too much... i don't know, I just chalk it up to people being people.
20:21  stoned: ner0x, looks like people here don't use jquery-ui
20:22  stoned: hehe

20:22  modles1: hey guys
20:22  mahen23: its pretty verbose
20:22  ner0x: mahen23: I have. Stupid mistake that I already found. Use firebug as well. :) Thanks though!
20:22  stoned: ahh
20:22  stoned: i totally forgot about firebug..
20:23 * stoned got irritated with firefox being so slow
20:23  modles1: why would safari and firefox be reporting a different .height() for a div. the div has an image floated left and an h3 and p with no float set? cheers
20:23  modles1: firefox is correct, safari is too small
20:24  mahen23: firebug has this cool feature that allows you to play with the padding and margin on an element live
20:25  juro: in this szenario http://jsfiddle.net/9eZMc/1/ , how can I select only the <li>s directly under ul.mainmenu?
20:25  mahen23: and once you got the numbers right, you just copy paste the css
20:25  modles1: mahen23:  you can change most values live
20:25  modles1: its a shame firebug doesnt have a 'save css' option
20:25  mahen23: modles1: yeah, but i like to play mostly with the layout boz
20:25  mahen23: box*
20:25  MichaelBehan: copy&paste
20:27  modles1: will jquery struggle to get height of a div in safari if child elements are floated
20:28 * mahen23 puts on sunglasses
20:28  mahen23: modles1: what if its not jquery the culprit?
20:28  antivirion: hey guys this here does not work any longer in jquery 1.4.3 $("#user_options a[href^=#]").click.........  if i remove the a[href... part it works... but i need to filter out ti see if it has a hash
20:28  antivirion: so whats the new fix.. i mean why is it not working anymore and how to make it work
20:29  modles1: mahen23:  well obviously the error is with my code or with safari, but i guess my question is what kindof things would freak jquery out

20:34  majorchamp: when hovering over a link in an iframe (the page not controlled by me), it displays the url in the status bar of the browser. Is it possible to grab the value of this status? Only way I can think of doing it is if you have a generic event firing every second calling for the "current" status since you might not be hovering over anything..and you can't capture the value of data inside an iframe
20:34  majorchamp: that you can't control

20:36  modles1: ah safari isnt including the height of the star image
20:36  danheberden: poppiez: animate operates on all elements in the collection
20:37  poppiez: danheberden: the two different elements get a different left value - not the same. does that still apply then?
20:37  danheberden: no - seperate calls then

22:11  snover: wolfman2000: jQuery does not have full XML support. You are pretty much on your own if you try to use it that way :)
22:12  wolfman2000: ...alright, backup plan then. Can all XML elements support the name attribute without issue?
22:13  snover: wolfman2000: XML itself has no restrictions on the attributes you can put on nodes…

22:21  kanzie_: can I have the datepicker work without an input. I want only the icon and populate a p-tag
22:22  BarelyFitz: maybe you could hide the input :-)
22:23  kojiro: That's what SHE said
22:23  kanzie_: BarelyFitz: im thinking about something like that unless it is possible
22:23  kanzie_: trying to get the darn thing to show up at all with an icon now
22:23  danheberden: hide input + http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#icon-trigger
22:24  BarelyFitz: or try calling it on input type=hidden
22:24  itmustbejj: how could I switch this over to a document.ready() event: jscolor.addEvent(window, 'load', jscolor.init);
22:24  kanzie_: danheberden: that only takes me to icon trigger, I got that part down already (though cant get the icon to show, but its just something wrong in my code)
22:25  BarelyFitz: itmustbejj: $(function(){ jscolor.init(); })
22:26  Rotham: hey... im trying to understand ajax context (with no background in js) what is something good I can read on the topic?
22:26  chuckmo: hello all.. i basically have a <label></label><span></span><input/> and when the input has focus(), I want to hide the label. I'm trying to do this with $(this).prev('label').hide(), but it only works if i take out the <span>. whats up?
22:27  Brodingo: rotham wikipedia?
22:27  Do``: anybody knows if there's going to be a jquery 1.4.4 to fix the bugs in 1.4.3 or we need to wait until 1.5? (meaning a much longer wait)
22:27  Rotham: haha alright
22:28  stoned: hello
22:28  itmustbejj: BarelyFitz thanks
22:28  stoned: I am .appending an element to the other element, and I also want to fadein the appended element
22:28  stoned: not sure hot to or ganize the chain
22:29  stoned: $(".showimage").empty().append('<img />');$(".showimage img").attr({'src' : data});
22:29  stoned: I'd like to fade the image in, please advise.
22:30  chuckmo: stoned: just add .fadeIn() to the attr chain
22:30  chuckmo: $(".showimage img").attr({'src' : data}).fadeIn()
22:30  stoned: huh
22:30  stoned: doh
22:30  coldhead: won't it already be visible?
22:31  stoned: yeh
22:31  Brodingo: .hide().fadeIn()
22:31  stoned: should I add .css(display,none)
22:31  stoned: ?
22:31  stoned: oh
22:31  stoned: .hide
22:31  stoned: huh
22:31  coldhead: maybe .css('opacity', 0) to prevent reflow
22:31  coldhead: ?tias
22:31  bot-t: Try It And See
22:31 * sneakyness pokes coldhead 
22:32  coldhead: hi sneakers
22:32  chuckmo: you could also just use $(".showimage").html('<img style="display:none"/>'); then the fadein
22:32  chuckmo: .html(content) is the same as .empty().append(content)
22:32  LCCX: Demo: http://www.logsine.com/sovsoc/
22:33  danheberden: chuckmo: then the image would be hidden
22:33  LCCX: Function: http://www.logsine.com/sovsoc/includes/js/functions.js
22:33  danheberden: and it's container would fadeIn
22:33  chuckmo: yeah, laod it as hidden then run $(".showimage img").attr({'src' : data}).fadeIn()
22:33  LCCX: Why, on slide(), do slider handle only push lower handles and not higher handles up?
22:34  chuckmo: so anyone have thoughts on my .prev(selector) dilemma?
22:34  chuckmo: hello all.. i basically have a <label></label><span></span><input/> and when the input has focus(), I want to hide the label. I'm trying to do this with $(this).prev('label').hide(), but it only works if i take out the <span>. whats up?
22:34  ajpiano: Do``, there'll probably be a 1.4.4
22:34  danheberden: LCCX, could you clarify th eproblem?
22:34  ajpiano: ?prevAll @ chuckmo
22:34  bot-t: chuckmo, .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
22:35  LCCX: chuckmo: I think you need another .prev()
22:35  Do``: ajpiano: do you have an educated guess on when? i don't know how bad things are and i don't know what used to be the trend with bugfix releases
22:35  chuckmo: beautiful aj! thanks
22:35  LCCX: danheberden: I am having a hard time finding the words for it. If you go to my demo page and drag a middle slider handle, hopefully you can see what I mean.
22:36  ajpiano: not really, but i would kinda be surprised, with some of the rgressions we have, that it would be more than a month
22:36  kanzie_: man I think I give up, I find no way to control that icon. It just places itself in the middle of everything and then the datepicker shows up in the top-left corner
22:36  PaulB: hey there do you guys use jquery or swfobject to embed flash?
22:36  ajpiano: hopefully shorter :)
22:36  danheberden: that is defaults to the lower step?
22:36  LCCX: danheberden: If you drag a middle handle to 0, it pushes lower-index handles down below it.
22:37  danheberden: lccx - it assumes you want that range between the nodes
22:37  coldhead: ?g jquery swfobject @ PaulB
22:37  bot-t: PaulB, jQuery SWFObject - http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/
22:37  LCCX: danheberden: If you drag it up, nothing happens to the higher handles until you release the middle handle.
22:37  coldhead: you don't have to choose one or the other <3
22:38  kanzie_: OK, so if I hide the input, the datepicker shows up in the top-left corner...not so stylish
22:38  Do``: ajpiano: thanks, that good
22:38  PaulB: coldhead: thank you
22:39  LCCX: danheberden: By default, can slider ranges be negative?
22:39  Do``: that's*
22:39  danheberden: ino
22:39  danheberden: *no
22:39  danheberden: its a feature request currently
22:40  LCCX: Okay, then which range between which two nodes/handles does jQuery think I want?
22:40  stoned: $(".showimage img").hide().attr({'src' : data, 'height' : 100, 'width' : 125}).fadeIn();
22:40  stoned: hey this ok?
22:41  stoned: or is there a better method?
22:41  BarelyFitz: stoned: you can drop the quotes around the attr names
22:41  stoned: oh
22:41  stoned: okie dokie
22:41  danheberden: lccx - i think it isn't a range issue
22:42  danheberden: it seems like a bug
22:42  LCCX: I do not want negative ranges for this application. I want to be able to divide an input by % into a number of categories, preferably with a single, multi-handled slider bar for now.
22:42  freedgy: Hi everyone, I'm using $('#myList li').each(function....  to itterate through all list items. I have 3 items in my html markup, but .each is looping through 5 items. Any ideas how I can troubleshoot this?
22:42  danheberden: yeah, you're just using independant tickers
22:42  LCCX: bug with jQuery, or with what I have written, since I haven't written much.
22:43  chuckmo: freedgy: what are the extra items?
22:44  freedgy: Oh.. I spoke too soon :p Looks like another script I'm working with is adding extra items (not visable in View Source) my bad.. thanks anyway chuckmo :\

22:44  LCCX: Ah, thanks!
22:45  chuckmo: stoned: i would load the image hidden (with style="display:none" in the tag) so there's no flickering and then take out teh hide()
22:45  chuckmo: in the <img> tag that is
22:46  stoned: is it possible to trigger a function on the last keypress event only?
22:46  stoned: or the last keyup event
22:46  ajpiano: how do you know that it's the last
22:46  stoned: exctly

22:49  kanzie_: so does anyone understand the datepicker, does it really _have_ to be tied to a input-element that _have_ to be visible?
22:49  kanzie_: I want a text to be the date with a icon next to it that expands the datepicker, feels like a fairly common usecase?

22:54  stoned: ajpiano, ok now im kinda confused on hwo to use this
22:54  ajpiano: cool, there aren't any demos or explanations on the site
22:54  stoned: basically i made it work, but i don't quite understand it.
22:55  toxic: ello guys, I'm trying to add some <div> right at the top of the page... juste after the <body>... But I can't find the right selector for that
22:55  stoned: how exactly is this delay handling
22:55  ajpiano: stoned: the way it works is that it sets a timeout on every keypress to do the action, but it cancels any preexisting timeout on every keypress as well
22:55  snover: kanzie_: If only there were some demos on the jquery ui site illustrating the use of datepicker without an input, but I guess you are just out of luck
22:55  stoned: i see
22:55  ajpiano: so that only when you keypress and then not keypress again, is the function that's in the timeout actually executed
22:55  kanzie_: snover: am I blind or what?
22:55  stoned: so the bound function only gets called XX time AFTER the last key press
22:55  ajpiano: exactly
22:55  stoned: ahh
22:55  stoned: btw
22:55  kanzie_: snover: right now I have a input with width 0px, background same as page-background

22:56  stoned: :D
22:56  snover: kanzie_: yes, you are blind.
22:56  hobs: im a bad programmer

22:57  serio: toxic, problem?

22:57  kanzie_: snover: you might showing me with your amazing sight.
22:57  Aristata: Guys and Gals I am very frustrated, I can't seem to select an element in jQuery through chromes inspector OR my scripts, i can type jQuery into the terminal and get something back, but doing something like $("#header"); keeps returning null, I KNOW there is a header as well, what's going on here?
22:57  toxic: serio : I tries $(document:first-child).after('<div>')...
22:57  snover: kanzie_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#inline
22:57  kanzie_: snover: that is not what I want
22:58  toxic: serio but it seems I'm using the after on the wrong selector
22:58  kanzie_: which I explained earlier... I want the icon-behaviour
22:58  Phrogz: Aristata: Are you sure that the chrome developer tools that you have is for the correct window/tab (if you have it detached)?
22:58  snover: kanzie_: I know it’s hard you will have to do some thinking yourself to figure out how to take that concept and turn it into exactly the thing you are looking for

23:00  ceej: hmmm that's what I thought...it's not working
23:00  serio: *read*, rather lawl
23:00  Phrogz: Aristata: So, to be clear: you have the Developer Tools anchored in the same window/tab. When you right-click and choose "Inspect Element", you see an html element with a particular ID. However, when you type $('#foo').length into the console, you get 0?
23:00  Aristata: correct
23:00  Aristata: well more specifically I get $"#foo"); = null
23:00  Phrogz: Aristata: Are you using something like Prototype that might be hijacking $? What about jQuery('#foo') ?
23:00  chuckmo: ceej: you may not be selecting your div right, because your clas name is "1". this should be a letter, not a number
23:00  Aristata: well more specifically I get $("#foo"); = null
23:01  Aristata: OMG that was it
23:01  Aristata: Thank you!
23:01  Phrogz: :)

23:01  ner0x: Are there a such thing as drop down menu buttons?
23:01  ner0x: Like a select, with a default button next to the selection arrow?
23:02  ceej: chuckmo: it's not one just using that as an example should have said one or something :)
23:02  chuckmo: ah gotcha
23:03  chuckmo: so $('div.class1').next('div').html() aint happenin?

Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?

23:18  frioden: hey guys...havin a little trouble with the step callback in the .animate function
23:19  frioden: can you only have one "now" value even though you pass a property map of both Left and right css properties?
23:20  nvictor: isn't there a way to just select an element?
23:20 --- lumberg is now known as frio80
23:21  g__: how do i change the value of a select input?
23:21  g__: simple $('#foo').val('someval'); ?
23:22  dabear_: g__: yes
23:22  frioden: if I pass $(".animateThis").css({left: 250px, right: 150px}); and I call $(".animateThis:gt(0)").css({left: now, right: now}): in the step function...it only animates the top value
23:22  Phrogz: frioden: Did you mean {left:"250px"... ?
23:23  g__: dabear_: what if 'someval' was a value that was not an option?
23:23  frioden: sorry {left: 250, right 250})
23:23  Phrogz: g__: tias
23:23  Vorspire: (Do``): you there?
23:23  Do``: +
23:23  frioden: sheesh
23:23  g__: Phrogz: yeah i have and they're not changing
23:23  dabear_: g__: simply construct and append an <option> then
23:23  nvictor: dabear_: how do i select one element?
23:23  dabear_: ?eq @ nvictor
23:23  bot-t: nvictor, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/

23:24  Do``: 64 :) you're persistent
23:25  Vorspire: I got bored and kept tweaking it lol :P
23:25  g__: would help if i corrected all js mistakes
23:26  nvictor: dabear_: thanks
23:26  g__: all's good now, thanks Phrogz / dabear_
23:27  Do``: Vorspire: take a look at $.fx.interval
23:27  Vorspire: ?
23:27  Do``: i think it would be better if you gathered info for a sec using that rate
23:27  Vorspire: the interval is simply the rate at which the data refreshes :)
23:28  Do``: mousespeed would work for shorter timeframes as well
23:28  Vorspire: it does :P
23:28  Do``: not just for units of 1 second
23:29  Do``: well yeah but if you lower the interval to something very small
23:29  Vorspire: $(this).mouseSpeed(function(data){ ... }, { interval: 10 }); /Every 1/10th of a second
23:29  Do``: the "last speed px/sec" becomes meaningless
23:29  Vorspire: Yea, Just testing by the px/s - it depends on thhe developer how they want to use the input :P
23:29  Do``: meaningless is probably the wrong word, i don't see a use for it
23:30  Vorspire: output even
23:31  Vorspire: hmm
23:31  Vorspire: (Do``): what if the developer wanted to use it to detect the % speed increase since the last movement? that's when lastSpeed comes in
23:31  nvictor: when do i find documentation on the "ui" object mentioned on the slider plugin page?
23:31  dabear_: wow
23:31  dabear_: http://jsperf.com/dot-first-vs-colon-first
23:31  dabear_: that is insane
23:32  nvictor: oh ok, found it
23:32  Do``: Vorspire: i think an option to show current speed and average speed, using 2 separate intervals might be better, if this is intended to give developers all options they would want
23:33  Do``: the key being, separate intevals
23:33  Do``: intervals*
23:33  Vorspire: I'll use an index that resets after each callback call, to detect the averages
23:34  kanzie_: ok, so I have now changed my whole take on the bloody datepicker(), now I have datepicker inline and hide by default, then have a button that show() the datepicker-div. But then I dont get the overlay effect but instead if is mixed with the items in the background in a weird way. Any ideas?
23:35  kanzie_: I wish I could go back in time a few hours and someone would have told me the datepicker doesn't work unless you have input-elements
23:36  S1kx: oh i know how you're feeling ;[
23:36  S1kx: i have setup a project for about 5 hours yesterday coding it with zeromq just to see that it doesnt support raw udp, so -everything- could be trashed away
23:37  kanzie_: S1kx: I suffer with you man
23:38  ManxPower: I'm a jQuery n00b.  I'm using the jqModal plugin.  The plugin is called as $('#contact').jqm({ option1: value1, option2: value2 });  I would like to replace value1 with a function that returns the value I want.  Where would I find docs on that?
23:41  BarelyFitz: kanzie - why can't you create an input element to use with the datepicker?
23:42  kanzie_: BarelyFitz: I can, just not what I want.
23:42  BarelyFitz: kanzie_: so make it a hidden element and copy value when you're done
23:42  kanzie_: I want a text as text in a div... an icon that presents overlay datepicker. The icon is to the right of the date
23:42  kanzie_: BarelyFitz: if it is hidden the overlay loose its anchor
23:42  kanzie_: and unfolds in top-left
23:42  wolfman2000: ...welp. Had to send an email to Keith Wood. Maybe he can figure out why my animation sucks.
23:42  kanzie_: corner
23:43  BarelyFitz: <input type=hidden>
23:44  nvictor: what are innerWidth and outerWidth ??
23:45  snover: if only there was some documentation
23:45  snover: that answered that question
23:46  addyosmani: if only.

23:47  kanzie_: grrr
23:47  kanzie_: BarelyFitz: just like that
23:47  kanzie_: BarelyFitz: let's see if I can get that working or if my html/css will mess it up
23:47  kanzie_: amazing job man

23:56  superyoda: does anyone know if I can make the jquery dialog only have an outline until the dialog is dropped?  there seems to be some preformance issues when the dialog window has lots of stuff in it, I would think this would make it faster, a la windows 3.1

23:56  jedmund: I'm not sure how to make repeated element act individually of each other
23:57  jedmund: probably a pretty noob problem
23:58  frioden: jedmund: what do you mean a repeated element? and act differently?
23:58  jedmund: so if you go to the finput.php file, theres two of the red dropdown menus
23:58  jedmund: if you click on one of them, they both open up
23:58  jedmund: instead of just the one you clicked on opening
23:58  Jonz: superyoda you can just give the dialog a css class when you start to drag it, then remove it once it's placed?  the css class might be visibility:hidden or something, whatever you need it to do
23:59  BarelyFitz: superyoda: make a custom helper for the draggable? http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#visual-feedback
23:59  devinrolsen: BarelyFits, sorry new to this ajax debugging: if you are saying
23:59  devinrolsen: error: function(XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
23:59  devinrolsen: 	alert(textStatus);
23:59  devinrolsen: }
