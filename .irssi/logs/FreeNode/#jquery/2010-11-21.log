18:49  miket3: can someone help me figure out what the jquery team uses on this demo page to achieve the outer scroll bars  http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#fillspace
18:49  miket3: I cant seem to get my accordion to apear inside of a scrollable section
18:50  RTPMatt__: css?  the overflow is set to auto?
18:50 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 83 seconds
18:50  miket3: is that for me RTPMatt__
18:50  RTPMatt__: yes
18:51  miket3: thanks
18:51  RTPMatt__: np
18:51 --- Chris____ is now known as k1t
18:51  paul_irish: overflow:auto
18:51  SeriousJonny: humm
18:51  SeriousJonny: a much harder task appears
18:51  SeriousJonny: creating a iframe dynamicly listening into it seams to work
18:52  SeriousJonny: but can i create a iframe without appending it somewhere?
18:53  whutch: what do you mean?
18:54  SeriousJonny: $.append("<iframe id='dynFrame'></iframe>");
18:54  RTPMatt__: seriousjonny: I am assuming you mean you don't want to see the iframe?  in that case you can make it 1px by 1px and hide it somewhere or something
18:54  SeriousJonny: aha
18:54  SeriousJonny: well yes that was my goal in the first place xD
18:54  anthony_: RTPMatt_  Didn't know if you had a chance if we could pick up where we left off last night.  Still not doing anything for me
18:54  SeriousJonny: but then i saw you can create them dynamicly and listen to them
18:55  SeriousJonny: so i thought i could place them into a "placeholder"
18:55  SeriousJonny: do stuff to it then append it to the body
18:55  RTPMatt__: anthony_: sure, sorry, i got distracted and then went to bed
18:55  SeriousJonny: but your solution should do the trick too
18:55  SeriousJonny: thx
18:55  RTPMatt__: seriousjonny: sure thing
18:55  anthony_: bascially when i add that  $.mobile.ajaxFormsEnabled = false;  the .click does nothign when a button is clicked
18:56  RTPMatt__: anthony_: yeah, let me take a look at the mobile stuff again
18:57  RTPMatt__: anthony_: can you link me to your code again so i can take a look?
18:57  eightfold: could anybody see why this jquery masonry thing isn't working in webkit browser, but in firefox? http://sn.im/1hxxsl
18:57  anthony_: yeah literally just closed pastebin
18:58  anthony_: RTPMatt_ the docs are saying i have to bind that mobileform event..
18:58  anthony_: not just place it in the .click what are your thoughts?
18:58  anthony_: "jQuery Mobile will automatically handle form submissions through Ajax, when possible." heh but doesn't tell me "how" it handles it
18:59  miket3: ok...  they have to be doing something else special besides overflow:auto.  something specific for chrome
18:59  aro: how do i create an element and insert text/html into it?
18:59  aro: i newcontent.append("p").html( contenthere ); doesnt seem to work
19:00  RTPMatt__: anthony_: it attaches a live event for form submits
19:00  thyphus: aro: http://tinyurl.com/274qxym
19:00  RTPMatt__: anthony_: at the top of which it does: if( !$.mobile.ajaxFormsEnabled ){ return; }
19:01  anthony_: huh
19:01  aro: thyphus: did yoiu read the first result? it doesnt explain at all what i need to do
19:02  aro: ill just build a string and use html() then
19:03  anthony_: hmm wonder if preventdefault would help
19:04  RTPMatt__: anthony_: it may, if your for is actually being submitted
19:05  anthony_: here is the pastebin again http://pastebin.com/G1ZUiDvx
19:05  anthony_: well I "thought" the form was actually being submitted
19:05  kernelpanic_: is it possible to get a "handle" on the html element just above the <script>-element from which js is executed? I'm patching in a framework and cannot get at element-IDs :|
19:06  paul_irish: var thisscript = document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1];
19:06  paul_irish: $(thisscript).prev();
19:06  shifteleven: yeah, but that would assume that you know the script tag
19:06  shifteleven: and that may be enough
19:06  shifteleven: oh wait, that would be the last
19:06  paul_irish: wha?
19:07  paul_irish: that first line HAS to run immediately
19:07  paul_irish: no document ready BS
19:07  RTPMatt__: anthony_: I am assuming that you have double checked that $("#chainButton") does actually select your button?
19:07  thyphus: aro: do you only read the first result if you google? read further...
19:07  RTPMatt__: anthony_: as it does not in the code you posted
19:07  shifteleven: paul_irish: yes, that also assumes that you're not doing any async-script loading
19:08  anthony_: yeah,  i does
19:08  anthony_: it does that is
19:08  paul_irish: mmhmm
19:08  dfrank: hello all. If i doing $("#someId").click(function(){/*do something*/}), then all previous click function attachments still present. How do i do to remove all previous click declarations for this element?
19:09  thyphus: y helo thar paul_irish. how you're doinin japan? ;)
19:09  shifteleven: kernelpanic_: are you doing any async script loading or anything?  I'm betting that paul_irish nailed it for the 80%
19:09  thyphus: s/nin/n\ in/
19:09  RTPMatt__: anthony_: what if you stick debugger; at the top of your click handler?  does it dtop there?
19:09  anthony_: umm
19:09  kernelpanic_: shifteleven: uh, what?
19:09  anthony_: never actually used the debugger
19:09  anthony_: so not sure what that is
19:10  paul_irish: thyphus: i'm back now. SF. ^_^
19:10  RTPMatt__: anthony_: you should, it is awesome.  it basically puts a breakpoint wherever you put it
19:10  thyphus: ah, ok ;)
19:10  paul_irish: that's a no. :)
19:10  anthony_: is it just a library i need to pull?
19:10  RTPMatt__: anthony_: if it gets to that line it fill bring up firbug there and let you step through your code
19:10  shifteleven: dfrank: http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
19:11  anthony_: where do i get the debugger?
19:11  RTPMatt__: anthony_: no, if you have firebug it will work
19:11  whutch: dfrank: .unbind("click") or .die("click") if you used .live() to attach it
19:11  dfrank: shifteleven: thank you much.
19:11  RTPMatt__: anthony_: or some other console if you are in a different browser
19:12  anthony_: well i'm using firebug
19:12  anthony_: console doesn't come upw ith anything in it
19:12  anthony_: when i run it.
19:12  anthony_: except that originally error message
19:12  ScottO_: im trygint o get the #('#MyElementId').val() and its returning '' always, when i inspect the lement in chrome it says the value is 3
19:12  RTPMatt__: anthony_: do you get the error on the page load, or when you click the button?
19:12  ScottO_: why cant i get the value of a select element?
19:12  miket3: ok.  thanks guys.  chrome recognizes css overflow.  but not jquery scrollable
19:13  ScottO_: would optgroup be causing the problem?
19:13  anthony_: If i have the .mobile tu turn off moibile forms nothing happens
19:13  anthony_: If i have it on then i get..
19:13  ScottO_: mi actually using $(this).val() in the event listener...
19:14  anthony_: k.attr is not a function
19:14  anthony_: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0a2/jquery.mobile-1.0a2.min.js
19:14  anthony_: Line 90
19:14  RTPMatt__: yeah, switch your script tag to this one: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0a2/jquery.mobile-1.0a2.js
19:14  RTPMatt__: the minified version is not helpful for debugging
19:14  eightfold: is there some error with how i load things up:
19:14  eightfold: jQuery (function ($){$('#wrapper').masonry({ singleMode: true });});​​​
19:14  eightfold: ?
19:15  whutch: ScottO_: have you checked to see if the selector is returning the right object?
19:15  eightfold: uhm
19:15  eightfold: http://pastebin.com/adWXLxDw
19:15  anthony_: ok now i get.. to.attr is not a function
19:15  anthony_: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0a2/jquery.mobile-1.0a2.js
19:15  paul_irish: you got a weird relationship with whitespace.
19:15  anthony_: Line 3321
19:15  eightfold: is what i meant
19:15  shifteleven: ScottO_: what does $('#MyElementId')[0] give you?
19:15  ScottO_: ive verified the element has the correct id and that even in the console i get a value of ''
19:16  anthony_: var toID = to.attr('id'),
19:16  shifteleven: ScottO_: in particular, what type of HTML element is it?
19:16  paul_irish: hahaha i repeat my sentiment
19:16  ScottO_: shifteleven: thanks, seems i have 2 elements with the same id
19:16  RTPMatt__: haha
19:16  ScottO_: :/ th div surrounding the select
19:17  anthony_: ?
19:17  shifteleven: cool.  so that one's easy to fix :)
19:17  Rixius: how can you use .attr to add an attribute witout adding the =""?
19:17  Rixius: so you can make <div></div> become like <div data-fooBar></div>
19:17  paul_irish: eightfold: kill the space after jQuery
19:18  whutch: Rixius: .attr("name","value")?
19:18  anthony_: RTPMatt_  see something?
19:18  paul_irish: oher than that its groovy
19:18  Rixius: whutch: not general usage, adding stuff like disabled, that doesnt need a value, it just needs to be on the element
19:18  RTPMatt__: anthony_: well, that error is more helpful i suppose
19:19  whutch: Rixius: oh I missed the second part
19:19  RTPMatt__: anthony_: are you getting that error on page load, or when you click the button?
19:19  NET||abuse: ok, i put an example of my code up on a test site.. if anyone can help me figure out the cross domain js template loading fun i'm having.. http://client2.test.featured.ie/
19:19  Rixius: whutch: it's cool
19:19  anthony_: when i click the button
19:19  anthony_: RTPMatt_: when i click the button
19:19  paul_irish: Rixius: ummmmmm i dont know if the DOM has an api for that
19:19  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: fancy another go at this problem i was asking you about before? :)
19:19  RTPMatt__: anthony_: ok, then it looks like it is trying to change the page
19:20  anthony_: what would cause that?
19:20  RTPMatt__: NET: i can try, i may have to leave soon, but as long as I am here ill do what I can
19:20  Rixius: paul_irish: sad day, i'll look into it
19:20  paul_irish: Rixius: just add a value anyway.. disabled="disabled"
19:20  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: that would always be appreciated.. http://client2.test.featured.ie/
19:20  Rixius: paul_irish: for now that's what I'll do
19:21  RTPMatt__: anthony_: my guess is the form submit.  It is hard to know without seeing the actual code.  Try changing it from $(button).click to $(form).submit
19:21  anthony_: form in $(form) being the id of the form?
19:21  NET||abuse: so the template that gets appended to teh end of 'body'  is not loading in firefox.
19:22  RTPMatt__: anthony_: correct
19:24  anthony_: well crap RTPMatt_
19:24  anthony_: that solved the problem
19:24  anthony_: what can i learn from this.. Always use $form.submit when dealing with forms?
19:25  _Madmartigan: definitely ( :
19:25  RTPMatt__: anthony_: i usually do
19:25  RTPMatt__: anthony_: glad it is solved though
19:25  _Madmartigan: u never know if the user will just hit enter or tab+enter
19:25  anthony_: Thanks for the time/help
19:26  RTPMatt__: anthony_: it is troubling though that we dont know why yoiu didn't catch it the first way
19:26  RTPMatt__: anthony_: np
19:26  eightfold: paul_irish: thanks, but chrome/safari still don't load masonry
19:26  RTPMatt__: NET: does it work in another browser?
19:26  eightfold: oops, he's offline
19:27  anthony_: Should i report this somewhere to the mobile team?
19:28  RTPMatt__: NET: is this the one you are talking about? <script src="http://dealsrv1.test.featured.ie/media/templates/meteorgoodiebag/mainapp.js" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"></script>
19:28  RTPMatt__: NET: because it is there
19:30  ispirto: hi, can i do the animation like mouseover on the logo of this page: http://www.mjz.com/ ?
19:32  NET||abuse: RTPMatt__: yeh, just had a quick run through stuff, i'm loading that script tag with LABjs, i think a jsonp request would be better for managing the callback
19:35  RTPMatt__: NET: so, is it working then?
19:36  whutch: ispirto: take a look at http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
19:39  liviu_: hi
19:40  liviu_: has anyone any ideea how to make this work ok: http://94.62.148.237
19:40  liviu_: when you click on the flag it show additional languages to choose from
19:41  liviu_: but what is the best way to make those disappear when the user moves the mouse away from that area ?
19:41  pixeltarian: is there a css equivalent to http://api.jquery.com/browser
19:41  pixeltarian: ???
19:42  RTPMatt__: liviu_: you can put them all in a div, then have a mouseout event for that div that hides it
19:42  liviu_: ok RTPMatt
19:48  pixeltarian: I kind of don't want to make something if a well maintained css reference exists
19:49  pixeltarian: I conceptually know what can be done, but I don't know every css property
19:51  imagma: pixeltarian: I think the best you can do is combined browser docs + CSS specs
19:52  liviu_: RTPMatt, i've done so but as soon as mouse leaves the current flag it all slides out.
19:53  Dracos: w3schools.com has a pretty good CSS reference
19:53  liviu_: although they the mouse is still in the wrapper div ( the one that has the mouseout )
19:55  liviu_: oh, sorry ... i should have used mouseleave instead of mouseout
19:56  ManiO: Hi
19:56  ManiO: any function to get an URL to a file giving a PATH to the FILE? thanks
19:56  RTPMatt__: liviu_: you got it fixed then?
19:56  liviu_: yes, thanks RTPMatt
19:57  RTPMatt__: liviu_: oh yeah, that looks nice
19:57  anthony_: gotta be kidding me, not it's not working again
19:57  liviu_: thanks
19:58  ManiO: anyway to print an OBJECT structure as I do in PHP with print_r ? thanks
19:58  ManiO: vardump?
19:59  RTPMatt__: Mani0: install firebug, then use console.log(object)
19:59  RTPMatt__: www.getfirebug.com
20:00  ManiO: ok, what about my first question to convert a path to a file to an URL to the file?
20:00  anthony_: well RTPMatt_ I lied, apparently it was my old stuff i was looking at (still alphaa on that server)
20:00  RTPMatt__: Mani0: it will make your life at least 10% better* *this is not a guarantee
20:00  anthony_: back to square one
20:00  m0dmd: sup everyone, hope you're all good
20:01  RTPMatt__: anthony_: that sucks, anyway, I would start by putting that debugger statement in and seeing what happens
20:01  bradmaxs: how can I debug json arrays?
20:02  wookiehangover: console.dir(var)
20:02  wookiehangover: in firebug
20:02  anthony_: hmm actually it was the right thing
20:02  wookiehangover: or console.debug
20:02  anthony_: I just dont' get what is causing it to do this error
20:02  anthony_: one second it works and now it's busted again
20:03  RTPMatt__: console.info
20:05  anthony_: ok fixed it
20:05  anthony_: good lord i need to take a break
20:06  bradmaxs: Is there a way to kill a process like die; in php and then print_r or something?
20:07  bradmaxs: I do use web inspector to see the output but I was wanting to see it before it is sent.
20:07  RTPMatt__: you can stick debugger; before it and it will stop on that line
20:08  Trisox: can someone help me out? i try to get matching results from this http://jsfiddle.net/ARXS4/25/
20:09  bradmaxs: never used that before.  I'll give it a try.
20:09  shifteleven: Trisox: what do you mean?
20:09  bradmaxs: and thank you!
20:10  RTPMatt__: sure, hope it helps
20:10  Trisox: i want to get matching results from a dropdown boxes selection
20:11  Trisox: and filter out data
20:11  RTPMatt__: Trixon: sorry, i am not sure what you are asking
20:11  Trisox: wel i get no result back
20:12  Trisox: it gives me a string thats it
20:12  shifteleven: Trisox: I think I know what you want
20:12  Trisox: :)
20:13  shifteleven: Trisox: why not just to $(this).serialize(), why add the extra ':input' selector?
20:13  Trisox: to get if there is a textarea also get that one
20:13  Trisox: thats not the part that goes wrong i think
20:14  shifteleven: I thought serizlize() on the form should give you that too
20:14  shifteleven: but your selector reads something like: $('#liveform:input')
20:14  shifteleven: well, i'm pretty sure that doesn't match any html elements on the page
20:15  Trisox: i did an update
20:15  Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/ARXS4/26/
20:15  Trisox: my php is iin the css box lol
20:15  Trisox: <form method="post" id="liveform">
20:15  Trisox: $('#liveform').submit(function(){
20:16  shifteleven: guess I was wrong
20:16  Bar_: Hi, I have this problem with jScrollPane: http://www.mail-archive.com/jquery-en@googlegroups.com/msg43106.html
20:16  Bar_: Anyone know how to fix it ? :|
20:16  shifteleven: Trisox: so when I get the alert, I'm seeing the input come through
20:16  shifteleven: is that what you're seeing?
20:17  RTPMatt__: Trixon: in the PHP after you run the quere don't you have to select the row from the result? (it has been a long time since I have done PHP)
20:17  Trisox: yes
20:17  ManiO: I have a FILE into my website directory structure, I want to call it from my js script using an URL format. Is there any funciton like in PHP that converts to an URL a path to a given file, thanks?
20:18  Trisox: RTPMatt i'm not good in php either
20:18  shifteleven: Yeah, http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php returns a resource, not a result
20:18  RTPMatt__: Trixon: i think you need mysql_fetch_assoc($result)
20:19  Trisox: mm
20:19  shifteleven: I also don't know if you have a good SQL statement either
20:19  shifteleven: when I do the replacements, I see: geslacht = '$ff1' becoming geslacht = 'geslacht="man"'
20:19  shishirmk: Hi i am writing a chrom extension and a i want to use jquery for analysing the DOM. I have to import the jquery file to another javascript file where i am writing my custom code. How do i do this?
20:20  Trisox: what do you mean replacements
20:21  Trisox: can you update so i can see what you have done?
20:22  RTPMatt__: Bar_: i think if you set the height on .jScrollPaneTrack to 99% instead of 100% it might fix the problem
20:25  pixeltarian: is there a jquery equivalent for lightview?
20:26  pixeltarian: http://www.nickstakenburg.com/projects/lightview/
20:26  Trisox: lightbox?
20:26  Trisox: there a lot of thouse out there
20:26  pixeltarian: lightview is pretty though
20:26  pixeltarian: and animated
20:26  Trisox: ?lightbox jquery
20:26  bot-t: Trisox, Cody Lindley's ThickBox - jQuery - http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
20:26  pixeltarian: just click something and see
20:27  Trisox: just google around there a lot lightbox clones out there
20:27  pixeltarian: you're assuming I didn't do that
20:27  pixeltarian: I'm asking because I can't find anything as nice
20:28  pixeltarian: would using 2 frameworks be horrible?
20:28  Trisox: ?piroBox
20:28  bot-t: Trisox, pirobox v.1.2 | jQuery Plugins - <link href="css_pirobox/shadow/style.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/p... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/V12
20:28  Trisox: i like piroBox
20:29  Trisox: horrible mm no if you use them corecly not realy only extra data for the user to download
20:29  Trisox: its where you put the bar/line
20:32  pixeltarian: will I have to use jquery noconflict?
20:33  ispirto: how can i get not mouse over'ed li's from a ul
20:34  Trisox: ?
20:34  Trisox: idd pixel no conflict would help :)
20:37  Kasreyn: i have a problem. jQuery says urls with alt=json&callback=? default to "jsonp" and thus can only be called asynchronously. so i figured i'll just call with "alt=json" but i get error every time for that $.ajax call. What am I doing wrong?
20:38  ispirto: can i use .not('.classname') ?
20:38  shifteleven: Kasreyn: are you trying to load your ajax from a domain that's not your own?  the callback=? is what allows JSONP to work
20:38  Kasreyn: i'm trying to $.ajax this url: http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/Deckswax/uploads?alt=json
20:38  Jarda: ispirto: in a selector or what?
20:39  Jarda: $('.something:not(.somethingelse)') works
20:39  shifteleven: yeah, that's not going to work unless you have the callback
20:39  Kasreyn: shifteleven: well yes, i'm trying to use google youtube api
20:40  Kasreyn: i don't see why i can't get the same data synchronously :)
20:40 --- ajpi is now known as ajpiano
20:42  Mr_Nobody: Hi, i need to remove a comment inside the head with jquery, how would i do that? Regexp?
20:43  shifteleven: Kasreyn: why do you care?
20:43  shifteleven: I would think async is better because it doesn't lock up the user's browser
20:43  Kasreyn: shifteleven: it would make it much easier to collect all the data and after it's all done do stuff with it
20:44  Mr_Nobody: nevermind, found that "view source" never gets changed..
20:44  shifteleven: Kasreyn: well, in the callback for one JSONP request, make a request for another one
20:45  shifteleven: then you get your order, but the browser still handles it async
20:45  shifteleven: that way other things can happen and not lock
20:45  Kasreyn: right but how would i know where to close my table ?
20:45  Kasreyn: i don't know when it's finished
20:47  shifteleven: you know when it's finished when your callback gets called.  further more, just close your HTML (I hope this is tabular data here) and then inject your results into the HTML
20:48  Kasreyn: shifteleven: i have a for loop inside my first request which will make further requests..
20:48  shifteleven: all the more reason to support async.  that sounds like it could take a while
20:48 --- elpancho is now known as jedimind_
20:48  shifteleven: you can chain things though callbacks
20:49  Kasreyn: how do you mean chain?
20:49  shifteleven: I'll show you.  one sec
20:54  sean`: ok
20:54  sean`: so, I bet everyone here has used jquery valdate at some time
20:55  Mr_Nobody: yeah
20:55  sean`: Do I really need to place an object for every element in messages to have a default ..
20:55  sean`: 'causer that'd be kinda ..
20:56  Mr_Nobody: Um

20:56  Mr_Nobody: Dont know sean`, i switched to jquery tools validation plugin. smaller and supports html5 browers out of the box
20:56  sean`: /care
20:56  sean`: but thanks :p
20:56  RTPMatt__: put an id on it, then select it $('#myCanvas')[0]
20:57  Mr_Nobody: how come people dont care every time i mention jquery tools??
20:57  RTPMatt__: or, really, at that point you chouls just do document.getElementById('myCanvas')
20:58  SugaSlide: http://www.shadyurl.com/ <-- sweet ass url masking tool
20:58  Mr_Nobody: SugaSlide: sounds shady.....
20:58  sean`: Mr_Nobody, it's not that, it's more that my question is very direct
20:58  sean`: Mr_Nobody, I <3 all jQuery
20:58  Mr_Nobody: sean`: Oh, ok. sorry i cant help on that plugin :-S
20:58  sean`: Mr_Nobody, already fixed it
20:59  Mr_Nobody: sean`: what was it?

21:01  eightfold: can't really figure out what i'm doing wrong
21:02  dabear: what is it supposed to do?
21:02  dabear: using ff4beta6

21:10  v-dogg: good evening. a quick question I'd love to get an answer: is the execute order of different $(function() {..}) definitive? if I have both inline <script> $(function() .. and included scripts (either in <head> or inside <body>) do I know the execute order for sure?
21:10  RTPMatt__: sure
21:13  aro: can you do $('.selector:not( $(this) ')
21:13  RTPMatt__: $.ready is LILO
21:13  RTPMatt__: so, yes you do know the order
21:13  ajpiano: aro: $(".selector").not(this)
21:13  sean`: man
21:13  sean`: I'm so awesome
21:13  aro: thanks
21:15  eightfold: it can't possibly be masonry itself is not functional, i must be doing some stupid error that i can't see.
21:15  eightfold: http://sn.im/1hxxsl
21:15  v-dogg: RTPMatt__: so basically the order which they are defined in the page (either via <script src=".. or inline)?
21:16  RTPMatt__: v-dogg: yes, the first one defined will be the first one executed
21:16  v-dogg: roger. thank you.
21:17  RTPMatt__: sure thing
21:17  v-dogg: how about <script> var foo = 'asd'; </script>. is foo defined when dom ready is triggered?
21:18  v-dogg: i.e. is it quaranteed to be defined or can it also be still undefined
21:18  RTPMatt__: v-dogg: it depends, if you have that above your $.ready, then yes, if you have it below it, the answer is maybe
21:19  v-dogg: ok. thanks again. this might explain some weird and random undefined errors I have seen
21:20  RTPMatt__: ok, good luck
21:23  kevinSJ: I have a small problem. I want to loop the last td in each tr in a table. After that I fetch the a inside that td and log the href-attribute from it. But I only get the first, any ideas? http://pastebin.com/TDJdWeyf

21:27  itissid: Hey I have a question on DOM compliance and how jQuery is designed around it... Does jQuery need the browser to be DOM compliant to a specific level?
21:27  itissid: I see some functions are just not there in jQuery
21:27  itissid: by functions I mean "functionality
21:27  itissid: Like ranges
21:28  itissid: import node etc

21:35  danktamagachi: hi all! I'm trying to make an interactive resume for myself on my website and i'd really like to have my different jobs dyamically display by using a tag-based system for users to refine what they would like to see
21:36  danktamagachi: so for example, they could click "school-based" and "management" and have jobs I've had with those attributes show up
21:36  SugaSlide: var $body = $("'body'); $body.click(..); $body.click(..)
21:36  danktamagachi: is there something in jquery that would help me with that? a plugin or the like?
21:36  shifteleven: SugaSlide: yeah
21:36  shifteleven: without the extra "
21:37  SugaSlide: i know its possible... just wondering if its really abd practice
21:37  SugaSlide: bad
21:37  SugaSlide: like... how many years of no sex i'll have to endure if i use it lol
21:39  ajpiano: sugaslide, of course it's find
21:39  ajpiano: fine
21:39  ajpiano: you probably want to put things on document instead of body, fwiw
21:39  v-dogg: SugaSlide: does your girlfriend review your code before letting you get some?
21:40  SugaSlide: ajpiano i have a bunch of elements i need to hide if clicked out of
21:41  SugaSlide: 2 if functions to handle them.. just trying to neaten it up now

21:42  aro: has anyone used the jquery ui checkbox plugin?

22:01  SugaSlide: if (.... .get(1)) ?
22:02  Mr_Nobody: SugaSlide: I think sean worked on something similiar but without using iframes
22:02  ajpiano: var elem = $(elem).length ? $(elem).get(0) : RESCUE()
22:02  sean`: Mr_Nobody, ?
22:03  SugaSlide: i only use iframes for the error message.. and the popups
22:03  sean`: why is my name being used?
22:04  sean`: you wanna get sued?
22:04  SugaSlide: the error message so that if the web server decides to load a ikky themed file with css it doesnt polute my dom
22:04  SugaSlide: lol
22:04  SugaSlide: sean` cause you awesome?
22:04  danktamagachi: does anyone know a non-hackish way of adjusting the height of a container div to the biggest jquery-ui tab? its hard to just cycle through and get all the heights because they are hidden divs
22:04  SugaSlide: its a price awesome people must pay im afraid
22:04  sean`: oh k, I'll let it -suga-slide

22:09  dabear: one extra semicolon
22:09  SugaSlide: also cache the this
22:09  SugaSlide: var $this = $(this)
22:10  danktamagachi: dabear, even without the extra semicolon i get a bunch of alerts with the different divs I have but all heights are 0
22:10  SugaSlide: .each(function(){ var $this =$(this); then use $this instead.. like $this.height()
22:10  dabear: SugaSlide: sure, but that's not his error..

22:10  bot-t: danktamagachi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
22:10  danktamagachi: ok
22:10  danktamagachi: will do now
22:10  SugaSlide: the .each after calling the .tabs?
22:12  haq: is there a better way to do this? var formCount = $('.worklog').find('form').length;
22:13  haq: this works fine, seems like i've done it a different way before though, but I might be confusing something
22:13  dabear: $(".workload form").length
22:13  danheberden: haq - you could combine the selectors lke ^^
22:13  danheberden: your way is typically a bit faster if you use an id
22:14  danheberden: $('#idOfWhatever').find('form')
22:14  danheberden: would not invoke sizzle
22:14  danheberden: thus a tiny bit faster
22:14  hwk2|1: is this right:
22:14  hwk2|1: $("#nume").css('border','1px solid #F00;');
22:14  haq: ooh okie =)
22:14  SugaSlide: but sizzle is nice!!!
22:14  SugaSlide: :P
22:14  haq: see i was doing workload:form
22:14  haq: but I get confused sometimes hehe
22:14  haq: thanks for the tip guys!!
22:14  hwk2|1: help
22:14  SugaSlide: 0')
22:15  ravenzz: hwk2|1 yes remove the ;
22:15  danheberden: hwk2|1: you cant do shorthand css
22:15  dabear: jquery is effin hot with sizzling speedz!
22:15  hwk2|1: you mean the colour code?
22:15  danheberden: "border"
22:15  hwk2|1: well thats how it is
22:15  hwk2|1: border: 1px solid #F00;
22:16  danktamagachi: SugaSlide, dabear, http://jsfiddle.net/Ac5FC/1/
22:16  danktamagachi: it looks kinda shitty in the small jsfiddle box
22:16  danheberden: hwk2|1: nah, i'm wrong
22:16  danktamagachi: but the idea is that I want the main content  div to stay the same size as the largest tab
22:16  danktamagachi: so that it doesn't dynamically resize when changing sections of the resume
22:16  SugaSlide: hwk2|1 http://www.jsfiddle.net/JYj23/
22:16  danheberden: like ravenzz said, just kil the semicolon
22:16  ravenzz: danheberden he can
22:16  danheberden: now where is it that shorthand doens't work.. hmmm
22:17  ravenzz: hwk2|1 http://jsfiddle.net/gGkZ3/
22:17  danheberden: hate those random thoughts on a sunday morning
22:17  danheberden: heh
22:17  SugaSlide: hehe
22:17  SugaSlide: ye
22:17  dabear: danktamagachi: ok, what was the issue again? the height seems to be correct no?
22:17  hwk2|1: ravenzz: thanks
22:17  ravenzz: np
22:18  danktamagachi: dabear, the alerts that pop up report the height of all the "job" tab divs as 0...  I need to get the heights so I can set the container div's height equal to the tallest job div
22:18  SugaSlide: lol
22:18  SugaSlide: its probs detecting the wrong divs
22:18  danktamagachi: all the tabs-x heights and the jobs-x heights are 0
22:18  danktamagachi: its not, because the names are correct
22:18  ravenzz: danktamagachi jsfiddle?
22:18  danktamagachi: the alert has name height
22:18  danktamagachi: http://jsfiddle.net/Ac5FC/1/
22:18  haq: hmm
22:19  haq: one thing that seems odd, is I get "b" is undefined doing this: var formCount = $('.worklog form'); formCount.each(alert(formCount.serialize()));
22:19  dabear: danktamagachi: replace the alerts with console.log()
22:19  SugaSlide: im getting a shit load of popups
22:19  SugaSlide: with numbers
22:19  dabear: annoying  hell
22:19  danktamagachi: sorry
22:19  danktamagachi: can remove
22:19  SugaSlide: that arent 0
22:19  danktamagachi: all of mine say "jobs-1 0" or "tabs-2 0"
22:20  SugaSlide: mine are like 400 etc
22:20  danktamagachi: really?
22:20  danktamagachi: why would it be different?
22:20  SugaSlide: 1 sec
22:20  danktamagachi: every single one of the alert boxes I get has 0 after the name, representing a 0 from the height function
22:21  SugaSlide: waiting for it to finaly load
22:21  danktamagachi: dabear, done!
22:21  SugaSlide: again
22:22  danktamagachi: SugaSlide, just changed alerts to console.log to make it les annoying to work with

22:24  danktamagachi: wtf? why would mine all be 0 and yours have correct heights?
22:24  SugaSlide: not too sure but i dont think tabs is the right thing for the job there
22:24  danktamagachi: SugaSlide, also, i was hoping to get the heights of all the jobs divs, even the hidden ones
22:24  danktamagachi: which are still reporting as 0 on your side
22:24  danktamagachi: also, what do you think would be a better tool
22:24  danktamagachi: ?
22:24  odin500: I'm using jquery to search for something; how do I get to the actual parent element of the text I want?
22:24  SugaSlide: nvm it works lol
22:25  ravenzz: danktamagachi having different pages could be a good way for SEO
22:26  SugaSlide: danktamagachi http://gyazo.com/d4bd7e0ef13dba4d8a05049c26a0d6f0.png
22:26  dabear: danktamagachi: also try outerHeight()
22:26  haq: http://jsfiddle.net/3Vxdy/  <-- i get b is undefined in firebug
22:27  ravenzz: danktamagachi also set a min-width for the main container!?
22:27  danktamagachi: ravenzz, i can set a min width but given that all my pages load dynamically i dont want the user to be stuck with a huge content pane on another page where there isn't as much content
22:28  danktamagachi: dabear, still get 0s with outerHeight.  is the solution to temporarily unhide the objects to get their height?
22:28  ravenzz: we are talking about width not height
22:28  danktamagachi: oh
22:28  danktamagachi: yeah i should do that
22:28  danktamagachi: hah
22:29  ravenzz: btw the tabs works great
22:29  ravenzz: what's the matter?
22:30  danktamagachi: ravenzz, when I switch from the "jobs" tab to the "activities" tab for example, the page resizes. it's just a little ugly
22:30  danktamagachi: would prefer to set the height of the page to the largest tab so that it never has to resize
22:30  ravenzz: you can set a min-height
22:30  danktamagachi: ravenzz, i just want to intelligently set the min-height to fit the content without being too large
22:30  ravenzz: to the largest tab size
22:31  danktamagachi: ravenzz, that is what i would like to do!  but I'm having trouble getting the heights of the tabs in order to do that
22:31  danktamagachi: ravenzz, because they are hidden and jquery height() returns 0s
22:31  ravenzz: use the :hidden
22:31  ravenzz: selector
22:31  ravenzz: http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
22:32  danktamagachi: ravenzz, my each() statement works fine.  if you look in the console log it detects each div and properly displays its ID. it just won't get the height. so it isn't a selection issue, its a height-detection issue
22:32  haq: nvm.. i found out what i was doing :)
22:33  danktamagachi: dabear, any other ideas?

22:37  _Madmartigan: "parent" not working as expected
22:37  _Madmartigan: li's from the first level are able to go into nested levels, not what i want
22:38  _Madmartigan: i can't think of how to use parent(':first');
22:39  dabear: danktamagachi: hol on
22:39  dabear: hold on
22:43  _Madmartigan: nvm, realised i can use .each()
22:44  _Madmartigan: gah no i cant ):
22:44  _Madmartigan: ok maybe i can, im being quiet now lol
22:45  dabear: danktamagachi: the tabs seem to have a negative height and width when hidden, by inspecting them in firebug and the layout tab
22:47  danktamagachi: dabear, so it seems the only way to do it would be to unhide it, maybe adjust margins so it unhides off screen, get the real height, and rehide, yeah?>
22:47  dabear: nah
22:47  dabear: I tried .show()ing them
22:47  dabear: still 0
22:50  danktamagachi: dabear, i've even tried removing the class -ui-tabs-hide, still can't get the height!
22:50  danktamagachi: class ui-tabs-hide that is
22:55  unkanon: $("*").html() is probably a dumb way to get the html of the whole document... what's a smart way?
22:57  ravenzz: danktamagachi the matter is that the width and height are auto
22:57  ravenzz: they haven't a fixed height or width
22:57  danktamagachi: hm.  but they have a computed height, right?
22:57  danktamagachi: as in, they are auto but they take up a defined amount of space given font size and stuff. so is there a way to measure that?
22:58  Down: someone did something like this in my script a long time ago and I'm wondering how I can do it again, I think its a syntax issue... $var =$.removeClass('class1').addClass('class2')  how can I set a series of stuff like that to a variable and then how do I append it?

23:00  danktamagachi: hm
23:00  danktamagachi: so it works when they are displayed already
23:01  danktamagachi: ravenzz, but there doesn't seem to be a way to detect the height of the skills tab when the experience tab is selected
23:01  dabear: danktamagachi: they have a computed height that is negative
23:01  danktamagachi: gar!
23:01  danktamagachi: this seems like it may be needlessly complicated
23:02  danktamagachi: I can just gues and set a min-height of 600px or so

23:05  danktamagachi: dabear, do you mean removing the whole, hashtag based navigation
23:05  danktamagachi: or just the bbq plugin?
23:05  danktamagachi: go ajax-less and have static pages for each one?
23:06  danktamagachi: each section of the site, i mean
23:06  dabear:  removing the whole, hashtag based navigation <-- yes
23:06  danktamagachi: i have been thinking the same.  do you say that for SEO purposes or just because it needlessly complicates things? the main reason i use it is to have smooth navigation with little fadein/out effects between sections of the site
23:07  dabear: it complicates things ;)

23:12  ajpiano: Down: you can store a reference to a function name and invoke it as a variable
23:12  ravenzz: you'll can change the value of myclass even
23:12  ajpiano: but not a function with an argumen string
23:12  wunderkin: _Madmartigan: alert() is part of js.... you have to use html only in noscript ;P
23:12  _Madmartigan: orly thx
23:13  _Madmartigan: ( :
23:13  dabear: _Madmartigan: seriously dude?
23:13  Down: I get all that but the part I'm confused about is this... instead of .removeClass('class').addClass('class2');   how could I make a long list of these .jquery()  things into a single variable... or do you do a function instead?
23:13  _Madmartigan: lol no
23:13  dabear: that WAS NOT a joke?
23:14  _Madmartigan: thought itd be an obvious joke ( :
23:14  dabear: good
23:14  _Madmartigan: sorry its my first day
23:14  ajpiano: Down: you make a jquery "plugin"
23:14  Down: lol, ok
23:15  Down: nevermind, I'll just write it out until I learn more
23:15  ajpiano: jQuery.fn.foo = function() { return this.each(function() { $(this).addClass("foo").removeClass("bar");   });  }
23:15  _Madmartigan: anyone know a thing or two about UI sortable "containment" option?
23:15  ajpiano: $("#thing").foo()
23:15  ajpiano: ok
23:15  ajpiano: bye evreybody gluck w/ your jqueries
23:16  wookiehangover: bye
23:16  Down: thanks ajpiano, I'll try what you suggested
23:16  unkanon: can anyone help me with this?  http://pastebin.ca/1998269
23:16  ajpiano: ?g jquery plugin authoring guildelines @ Down
23:16  bot-t: Down, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
23:18  _Madmartigan: can javascript in ajax loaded content (using the second param of load to grab an element) ALWAYS be initialized IF you know how to do it?
23:23 --- mspa is now known as matsebc
23:23  ||cw: _Madmartigan: what do you mean "initialized"
23:24  _Madmartigan: grabbing an element from a full html doc that would normally attach events to the element
23:25  ||cw: not following
23:25  _Madmartigan: ok, meaning i want to load() an elemt from a page...
23:26  _Madmartigan: that element would normally have some jquery events....  but they dont fire because the js that would normally be run (on the full page) is not run
23:27  ||cw: so you are using .bind() to attach an even to all elements of certain type?
23:27  ||cw: maybe use .live() instead
23:27  _Madmartigan: the question is not HOW, but CAN it ALWAYS be done
23:28  _Madmartigan: caps for emphasis
23:28  ||cw: well, I'm trying to undestand what you are doing that isn't working
23:29  dalela: Hi
23:29  _Madmartigan: its more of a general question
23:29  ||cw: it sounds like you want live() instead of bind(), but I', not sure since you are being very high level and vague
23:30  _Madmartigan: yes, vague on purpose
23:30  dalela: I have a div with two words in it. Now I want to move this div up on a click (with an effect). Is this possible with jquery?
23:30  jrockjiggz: i have content loading with jquery ajax, and this one page all the link load blank content, but if I follow the url in browser content shows.. what gives any ideas how i can trace this?
23:30  ||cw: ok, if you want to be high level and vague, then the yes answer is maybe
23:30  ||cw: it depends
23:30  dalela: you mean me?
23:31  ||cw: dalela: I think that's possible
23:31  dalela: do I have to use jquery oder jquery ui ?
23:31  _Madmartigan: thx cw, that works for me
23:32  ||cw: jrockjiggz: is your ajax coming back blank?
23:33  ScottO_: how would i reverse an insertAfter?
23:33 --- Afkytman is now known as Ikamusuko
23:34  ||cw: ScottO_: like, delete the things that was inserted?
23:34  ScottO_: im adding a loading gif image
23:35  jrockjiggz: ||cw: no, its an entire html page
23:35  ScottO_: guess i can can just use remove
23:35  ||cw: jrockjiggz: are you ajax loading it into an iframe?
23:38  jrockjiggz: ||cw: ok i narrowed it down, it is part of the URL ( &amp;NetworkName=1%201%201%209-15%20Team ).. possibly jquery doesn't handle url encode?
23:39  serio: what up ya'll
23:39  jrockjiggz: ||cw: in english is: ( &NetworkName=1 1 1 9-15 Team )
23:39  waawaamilk: I have noticed some strange behaviour in the 'tabs' UI plugin: the show event sometimes gives you ui.panel as an array with the panel it it, and other times gives you just the panel.
23:39  jrockjiggz: so i think the spaces are breaking jquery's load() function
23:39  waawaamilk: any rhyme or reason for this?
23:40  ||cw: jrockjiggz: it should, what's the server getting?
23:40  dabear: jrockjiggz: by design, load accepts a selector in the url string
23:41  coldhead: touch me i'm sick
23:41  dabear: "http://foo.com #bar" would mean "find the element #bar in the site foo.com"
23:41 * danheberden pokes coldhead
23:41 * dabear touches coldhead's head
23:41  dabear: so freezing
23:41  coldhead: you make me like this, dan baby
23:41  danheberden: my most sincere apologies
23:42  ||cw: jrockjiggz: oh you mean you aren't encoding the url?  yeah I think you have to handle that yourself
23:42  jrockjiggz: ||cw: the httrequest has only the first '1', the rest is cut off/missing
23:42  bradmaxs: hey all: how can I debug the data sent? http://jsfiddle.net/Dt22B/
23:42  ||cw: jrockjiggz: really better to pass the params as an object anyway
23:42  jrockjiggz: is there a js urlencode() ?
23:43  jrockjiggz: ||cw: its all done by url
23:43  ScottO_: shouldnt $(this).remove('img') work just fine if i added by $('<im src="...">').insertAfter($(this)); ?
23:45  ScottO_: nm
23:47  Down: is it a big deal why type of html I use? I mean is it ever going to matter if my site is built on XHTML 1 vs 5? Do you think there will be a converter eventually?
23:47  dalela: cw, do I have to use jquery ui ?
23:47  dalela: Is it possible to move a div which position is not absolute?
23:48  wookiehangover: Down: that's not really how it works
23:48  Down: ok, just making sure it won't be a big deal in the near future
23:48  Down: I don't want to remake everything
23:48  wookiehangover: Down: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Version_history_of_the_standard
23:48  ||cw: dalela: relative should be movable too
23:48  jrockjiggz: how do you text replace space with %20?
23:48  ||cw: if you want to use jqueryui's effects plugins, then well...
23:49  ||cw: you can certainly use some other effects
23:49  ||cw: jrockjiggz: .replace I think, plain old javascript
23:49  wookiehangover: jrockjiggz: encodeURIComponent(string)
23:50  dalela: cw, but when it's relative nothing happens when calling animate({'top':'-=150px'})
23:50 --- fabiomcosta_ is now known as fabiomcosta
23:50  dalela: When it is absolute, it works
23:50  dalela: but it should be relative
23:50  ||cw: -= ?
23:51  dalela: yes
23:51  dalela: $('#logo').animate({"top": "-=150px"}, "slow");
23:51  wookiehangover: {'top':'-=150'}
23:51  ||cw: not familiar with that notation.  maybe it has to be absolute
23:51  wookiehangover: leave off the px
23:51  jrockjiggz: wookiehangover: sweet
23:51  ScottO_: i cant seem to remove all img tags within a div....
23:52  dalela: wookiehangover, this does not change anything here
23:52  wookiehangover: I'm just telling you whats in the documentation
23:52  wookiehangover: ? animate @ dalela
23:52  bot-t: dalela, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
23:53  dalela: yes, I read that
23:53  dalela: But I'm asking why a position:relative div is not moving
23:53  dalela: the same div with position:absolute moves
23:55  jrockjiggz: hmm. encodeURIComponent is encoding http:// to http%3A%2F%2F and so the browser is requesting: http://http%3A%2F%2F
23:55  jrockjiggz: i am getting 404 error
23:56  Down: omg, I now understand params in functions!! dude, they are just FREAKing variable names that you can assing later! WTF, it has been so confusing writing functions and not understanding that
23:56  snover: jrockjiggz: you don’t read very much, do you
23:56  snover: ?101 @ Down
23:56  bot-t: Down, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
23:56  wookiehangover: jrockjiggz: you need encodeURI()
23:56  jrockjiggz: omg. sorry
23:56  Down: I tried readign that, too boring
23:56  Down: I need examples
23:56  snover: it has examples.
23:56  dalela: wookiehangover, you know what I mean?
23:56  _Madmartigan: reading = boring?
23:56  Down: I mean, like w3schools has
23:57  Down: but better cuz w3schools sucks
23:57  wookiehangover: dalela: no, i tried that and it definitely works
23:57  wookiehangover: is your selector good?
23:57  _Madmartigan: w3schools is great imo
23:57  jrockjiggz: i googled  encodeURI() and brought me to a page with encodeUriComponent and i copied the example.. oops
23:57  _Madmartigan: the little test windows are great
23:57  jrockjiggz: wookiehangover: thanks - works now :D
23:57  wookiehangover: ?cc
23:57  bot-t: CASE CLOASED >: |
23:57  snover: _Madmartigan: no.
23:58  snover: _Madmartigan: NO.
23:58  _Madmartigan: ynot?
23:58  snover: ?w3schools @ _Madmartigan
23:58  bot-t: _Madmartigan, http://oksoclap.com//whyw3schoolssucks
23:59  _Madmartigan: hmm yeah i guess
23:59  _Madmartigan: havent used the site for years...
23:59  _Madmartigan: but thats where i got started
23:59  Down: snover!!!!
23:59  snover: what?
23:59  _Madmartigan: omg yes agree with the certification bit
