20:08  aro: explain?
20:08  jdunck: sorry, working on dpaste to make it clear :-)
20:08  aro: so you have $('#id').click(function() { .... });

20:49  Ankabout: jdunck:  maybe you can answer a simple question for me as well... I've been shouted at for not making my site compatible with non-JS browsers (why someone would turn that off... no idea)
20:50  jdunck: Ankabout: JS has serious security implications :-)
20:50  jdunck: as does flash, etc
20:50  jdunck: but what's the q?
20:50  Ankabout: almost (if not all) all of the stuff on my site with JS is making things appear or disappear (news sliders, etc).  how should I go about making everything that's hidden for the JS to show visible to non-JS people?
20:51  Ankabout: if that makes any sense
20:52  jdunck: sure.  are you saying there's not enough room to show everything at once?
20:52  Ankabout: well for example, I have a news page with all the teaser texts showing, and on clicking a link, jquery animates the main body of the news into view
20:53  Ankabout: now if someone doesn't have js enabled, I want the body visible already
20:53  Ankabout: the way it works now is I have display: none; in the css of the body block, and on clicking jquery slides it down
20:54  vebbe|wrk: use jquery to set 'display: none;'
20:54  vebbe|wrk: not css.
20:55  Ankabout: won't the stuff appear quickly then and then disappear from the jquery once it's run

21:00  Ankabout: so temp01, your solution will obviously not cause the flickering, and vebbe|wrk's solution will, right?
21:01  temp01: it won
21:01  temp01: it won't
21:01  temp01: you'll do .shit { display: none }   .nojs .shit { display: block } in css
21:01  Ankabout: exactly, I get that
21:03  temp01: if you want to be evil, put the .nojs .foo stuff in an external css at the bottom of the page .. to give nojs users some nice sweet flickering
21:05  Ankabout: temp01: haha got it
21:06  Ankabout: I just tried vebbe|wrk's solution, and I don't see flickering... is that just me not seeing it, or does that also not flicker?
21:06  Ankabout: I'll eventually make a css file for the no-js people, and change things accordingly, but just testhing this one first, as it's faster to test
21:08  temp01: it depends on the time it takes for the content to load then the js to execute
21:08  temp01: you probably won't see it on a fast browser when browsing localhost
21:09  Ankabout: not browsing local, but of course I'm the only user on the site right now

21:41  temp01: jdunck: can't you just change it to .bind('example', fn(e, arg) {})
21:42  dub54: temp01: what am I doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/LSSSLthC it's returning 200? but firebug is showing it return 3654
21:42  jdunck: temp01: sure, but why the broken abstraction?
21:43  jdunck: normally, bind just takes fn, right?
21:43  snover: treasonx: do you have a link?
21:43  temp01: jdunck: the first parameter is always the event object
21:43  temp01: that contains information about the event that just triggered
21:43  temp01: dub54: what does the alert show
21:44  dub54: 200
21:45  temp01: where do you see 3654?
21:45  temp01: note that you are sending xhr.status to the callback to the return value of the ajax request
21:46  temp01: http://pastebin.com/C6Q7Wscy
21:46  jdunck: temp01: holy shit.  i'm not sure why, but i was just sure that the only args to the bind fn were explicit ones.
21:46  jdunck: i just spent forever thinking it was something to do with me relaying
21:46 * jdunck goes for a beer
21:46  dub54: temp01: firebug response says 3654 (which is right)
21:46  jdunck: temp01: thanks for unscrewing me

22:58  ajpiano: that's why it hasn't been released yet
22:58  ajpiano: cause its' on googlecode

23:05  nail_: Hey, would anyone happen to know if there's a way to get rid of the cached data of /one/ given site in chromium, from the browser? (i.e without going manually through the sqlite tables)
23:05  vladikoff: 1.4.4 ftw
23:05  ajpiano: webchick: if you play near the edge cases you deserve to fall off is what i say!!
23:05  coldhead: what about stuff broken in 1.4.4?
23:05  temp01: nail_: .. ctrl+shift+r ?
23:05  webchick: ajpiano: well said!
23:05  temp01: coldhead: they'll become features
23:05  seutje: heh
23:05  ajpiano: coldhead: that's what 1.4.5 is for, it's due 67 futures from now
23:05  temp01: it's a feature not a bug etc
23:05  temp01: no u ajpiano
23:08  nail_: temp01: it doesn't get rid of the browsing history of the whole site, not the session data
23:08  nail_: *nor
23:08  paul_irish: what data are you trying to clear?
23:08 * coldhead hugs bot-t temp01
23:08 * bot-t hugs coldhead back
23:08  temp01: it just reloads the page ignoring cached data
23:10  nail_: paul_irish: everything related to one given site, cached images, scripts,... cookies, visited links, basically I'd like to test one site as if I was a first time user, and you can only batch delete by time periods on chromium obviouslu (unless you go playu with the sqlite dbs)
23:10  paul_irish: do it in incognito mode.
23:10  temp01: incognito still uses history etc from your normal profile
23:11  temp01: nail_: just do it in a diff profile
23:11  paul_irish: ^
23:11  temp01: chrome --user-data-dir=/tmp/foo
23:12  nail_: oh Im gonna try that, thanks to both of you :)
23:13  dabear_: would /dev/null work too?
23:13  coldhead: sharp as a tack, temp01
23:13 --- webchick is now known as webchick|afk
23:13  seancurtis: gmorning all
23:13  jonkri: is there a plug-in can i use to display a notice at the top of the page (like the chrome save password notice, or firefox pop-up block message)?
23:13  vladikoff: hey seancurtis
23:14  nail_: wondering if that could be made through an extension, could be handy
23:14  coldhead: gday sean
23:14  seancurtis: mornin vlad, cold
23:14  Brodingo: sup #jquery
23:14  coldhead: space gypsies, Brodingo
23:15  Brodingo: woooaaahhhh
23:15  paul_irish: jonkri: i dont know of one but there should be something out there for it
23:16  paul_irish: we call it a "butter bar" at google but generally its called a browser notification bar
23:17  seancurtis: jonkri: should be able to write something simple that uses the new notifications API - http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/notifications/quick/
23:17  seancurtis: just fall back to prepending a div or something for other browsers
23:17  seancurtis: paul_irish: why butter bar?
23:17  paul_irish: its the color of butter.
23:18  seancurtis: makes sense
23:18  paul_irish: :)
23:18  seancurtis: how's google treating you?
23:19  temp01: nail_: extensions are installed per profile. you can just create different system shortcuts to launch different chrome profiles
23:20  temp01: paul_irish: it's called infobar on the chromium pages
23:20  seancurtis: anyone know if there's a way to run FF4 at the same time as 3.6?
23:20  temp01: portaable ff?
23:21  seancurtis: hrmm lemme go look that up
23:21  seancurtis: awesome temp01 - forgot all about portable versions
23:22  seancurtis: hrm portableapps version is win only
23:23  seancurtis: sad panda
23:23  nail_: temp01: I meant, creating  an extension that would delete all data for a site
23:23  temp01: nail_: ok
23:26  jonkri: paul_irish, seancurtis: thanks
23:27  paul_irish: find one?
23:27  jonkri: seancurtis: only chrome is supported? :P
23:27  paul_irish: http://alexbarberis.com/infobar/
23:27  paul_irish: god that one is shit.
23:27  jonkri: that's a little strict... and i don't even care about ie8 or ie9 or whatever they are doing
23:27  jonkri: paul_irish: no i have not found one yet
23:28  paul_irish: much better http://www.jeroenvanwarmerdam.nl/content/resources/javascript/jquery/infobar/infobar.aspx
23:28  seancurtis: jonkri: that'll change as time goes on :)
23:28  paul_irish: jonkri: use the one i just linked.
23:29  jonkri: paul_irish: i don't find any license
23:30  dub54: hi, my code is saying loop undefined, http://pastebin.com/KyA0s2sZ i'm trying to make an ajax request every x amount of seconds, and increment in 20
23:30  jonkri: seancurtis: i'm all for that but i prefer to support at least the recent firefox as well at any time :)
23:30  snover: dub54: ugh.
23:31  snover: ?g setinterval harmful @ dub54
23:31  bot-t: dub54, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
23:31  snover: also, passing a string to setTimeout or setInterval means you are calling eval. Don’.
23:31  seancurtis: jonkri: well it's just progressive enhancement right - if there's a standard/browser implementation then use that and fall back to a manual div+button method for the browsers that don't have support
23:31  snover: Don’t*
23:31  seancurtis: jonkri: then as support increases you end up using the browser implementations
23:32  jonkri: seancurtis: yeah, that's nice
23:32  dub54: snover: use what instead? someone suggested that way in here..
23:34  jonkri: seancurtis: actually i will use that and fallback to an alert()
23:35  seancurtis: jonkri: ewwwww
23:36  seancurtis: is it a strong warning that you want to prevent them taking any action or is it just a notification?
23:36  seancurtis: you could use one of the growl-like plugins if it's just little notifications
23:36  jonkri: seancurtis: i'm thinking it's not that important since it's just an alpha. i can recommend users to use chrome
23:36  seancurtis: the growl ones allow for simple notifications where no interaction is required and also has options for displaying ones that need to be dismissed
23:37  jonkri: seancurtis: i will look into it though
23:37  jonkri: thanks again
23:42  dub54: how can I use $.get in a loop, and delay each loop by x seconds
23:42  l4rk: use a timeout
23:42  RobW: don't use a loop
23:43  dub54: snover: ?g setinterval harmful @ dub54
23:43  dub54: what should I use then ?
23:43  l4rk: i just told you
23:43  l4rk: use a timeout
23:43  RobW: function myFunc() { /* do stuff */ } var myInt = setInterval(function() { myFunc(); }, 5000);
23:43  l4rk: read pls
23:43  l4rk: no do not use an interval as already said
23:43  RobW: you could just use setTimeout and just call the function within itself
23:44  l4rk: function myFunc() { $.get("...", function() { /* do stuff */  setTimeout(myFunc, 5000); });
23:44  l4rk: syntax error >_<
23:45  l4rk: }); }
23:45  random_nick: Hi, I want to make portlets with jQuery UI. I managed to replicate the behaviour of the provided example, but I have a problem - I want to be able to make a selection inside portlets, but when I click on them, drag operation starts.
23:46  random_nick: It is possible to customize dragable elements, so it will be possible to specify some element as a "handle"
23:47  random_nick: ?
23:47  ajpiano: random_nick, like the "handle" option?
23:47  ajpiano: sortable supports all of draggable's options, one of which is a handle
23:48  random_nick: ajpiano: thanks, that's it. Must have missed that while reading docs
23:49 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
23:49  dub54: l4rk: do I call myFunc() inside the loop?
23:49  l4rk: it gets called in the timeout
23:50 --- YuRi- is now known as YuRi
23:51  dub54: how do I break out of the function?
23:52  dub54: well, until it reaches totalSubscribers
23:58  l4rk: dub54: you have an if statement and only call setTimeout if you want to conintue
23:58  l4rk: continue*
