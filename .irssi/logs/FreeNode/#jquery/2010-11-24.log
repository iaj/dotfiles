00:00 @ajpiano: wha
00:01  sonoprontosonoqu: trying to optimise, there can be quite a load of elements
00:01  SJr: Hmmmm
00:02 @ajpiano: yes, you could use the same index approach on   asmaller tree, just do a more refined selection
00:02  SJr: lets say that some jQuery animation stopped running
00:02  SJr: is there a way to get it to continue?
00:03  sonoprontosonoqu: SJr not likely, unless you open the box and recode
00:03  SJr: assuming .stop() is never called what could cause an animation from not finishing?
00:04  tori: Hot damn, lots of people here.
00:04  SJr: what could prevent an animation from not finishing
00:04  sonoprontosonoqu: memory
00:04  SJr: memory?
00:05  sonoprontosonoqu: or another event using the same global variables and running in parallel. is there a "var " missing ?
00:05  SJr: hmmmm
00:05  SJr: I don't know what you mean
00:06  SJr: would calling innerHTML kill existing JS?
00:06  sonoprontosonoqu: happens sometime that we forget to define the variable in a callback or function. that actually tells js to look for a global variable
00:06  SJr: Hmmmm basically I have an IM client, and a Browser control, with the browser control I can execute javascript from java. So one thing I do is I append data to the DOM via innerHTML,   and then get jQuery to animate it in.
00:06  SJr: However if I append / call jquery fairly quickly. The jQuery effect never finishes.
00:07  SJr: you can see it here
00:07  SJr: http://imagebin.org/124153
00:07  SJr: so above, I'm typing slowly and the john thomson is a bot, that echos back
00:07  SJr: the first few lines I do it slowly
00:07  SJr: then I start hammering away at it
00:07  SJr: and the jQuery seems to stop running when new messages come in.
00:08  SJr: I have tried looking at the callback function on the fadeIn() and that never gets evaluated on the things that don't fade in all the way
00:08  solars: hey - which plugin for tables (ajax) do you recommend? datatables?
00:08  sonoprontosonoqu: way too complex for me.  just gave a wild guess
00:09  SJr: I don't need to scope the following do I:
00:09 --- b[a]nanasontoast is now known as bananasontoast
00:09  SJr: ($("#block_25")).slideDown("fast",scrollv)?
00:09  SJr: ($("#block_26")).slideDown("fast",scrollv)?
00:10  SJr: if I execute both of those in succession
00:10  SJr: will the second interrupt the first?
00:11  tori: I have elements inside a <p>. What can I do to have all of the elements hide when I do $('p').hide()?
00:11  Lumpio-: Hiding the parent image obviously makes the children disappear as well
00:11  Lumpio-: What do you mean?
00:13  karega: I am attempting to use jQuery.ajax with Yahoo's Placefinder and I keep getting an error
00:14  karega: ajpiano
00:15  coldhead: karega
00:15  tori: Lumpio-: it doesn't seem to work at the moment.
00:16  tori: Let me get an example going.
00:19 --- Gercek_ is now known as Gercek
00:20 --- cpg|brb is now known as cpg
00:20  aidan: How can I add something to the dom then make a pretty animation on it. e.g. $('.feed').append(chunkofhtml)
00:20  aidan: I want to animate the li's in "cunkofhtml"
00:21  tori: Lumpio-: This just doesn't seem to work. http://fpaste.org/uedm/
00:22  pk4r: How do I stop propagation and immediate propagation from jquery UI's datepicker's events such as onClose ? No 'event' handle is provided..
00:22 @ajpiano: aidan: $(chunkofhtml).hide().appendTo(".feed").fadeIn()
00:23  kevinSJ: I have a small problem. I use jquery UI sortable() which has a serialize method. At the moment I get positions[]=number for each item.
00:23  kevinSJ: Is it possible to get it as a named hash/array?
00:23  kevinSJ: like this position[name]=number
00:23 @ajpiano: tori: you know you're missing a quote in the script tag right
00:23 @ajpiano: kevinSJ: just write your own function that does it
00:24  kevinSJ: ajpiano, Okey.
00:24  tori: ajpiano: >.> oops http://fpaste.org/vw9P/
00:24  aidan: ajpiano: ah forgot I could build a jquery object from a string
00:24  aidan: cheers!
00:25  tori: Also, do you guys know of a good collaborative platform for testing code? Like fpaste.org, but with visualizing and rendering the html.
00:26  karega: ajpiano, can you tell me why this doesn't work?  http://www.jsfiddle.net/b6g6W/
00:26  karega: coldhead, you can chime in also
00:26  JKarsrud: tori: jsfiddle has revisions etc?
00:26  JKarsrud: minus the '?'
00:26 @ajpiano: tori: jsfiddle
00:26  tori: JKarsrud: neato
00:26  tori: ajpiano: thankyou
00:27 @ajpiano: tori: i made a fiddle of your problem alread http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/AcRZS/
00:27  tori: Thanks :)
00:28  eTiger13: karega: what doesnt work about it?
00:31 @ajpiano: tori: it works if oyu use a div
00:31 @ajpiano: technically, p elements aren't supposed to be used as containers
00:31  tori: ajpiano: I see.
00:32  tori: Thank you for the info. I will test that now.
00:32 @ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/AcRZS/3/
00:32  tori: Oh man, I really like jsfiddle
00:32 @ajpiano: yeah
00:32 @ajpiano: it's amazing
00:33 @ajpiano: we use it for all jquery bug testcases now
00:33  tori: My apologies for not reading the topic before asking about it.
00:35  rchern: I wish they'd hurry up with user settings
00:41  madhat: does anyone know why the background-color on the note element changes to black when moved, instead of a varying shade? http://pastie.org/private/fshykqry0lzllmdgyfer5w

00:42  Mafia: hi
00:42  Mafia: anyone uses teh syntaxhighlighter?
00:43  JKarsrud: Ahh, this is just weird. http://pastebin.com/RRQe9fh4
00:43  karega: someone checkout my fiddle
00:44  JKarsrud: The markup that code works with has a form and an input type="submit"â€¦ :P
00:44  JKarsrud: Someone needs to learn to not overcomplicate things, huh?
00:45  NET_: jeeebuz,
00:45  NET_: my internet connection died :(
00:46  NET_: what's this about? jQuery not defined?????   http://dealsrv1.test.featured.ie/cbtest.html
00:47  JKarsrud: NET_: type="text/javsacript" != type="text/javascript" :)
00:48  JKarsrud: if you fix that, I guess things should work out better for you :)
00:48  twalve: should do the link's correct
00:48  JKarsrud: but the mime-type isn't
00:49  twalve: exactly
00:49  JKarsrud: aka. he has written text/JAVSACRIPT, not text/JAVASCRIPT
00:50  twalve: relax :) I'm 100% behind your diagnosis :D
00:50  JKarsrud: yeah, I just wanted to caps it to make it even clearer ;)
00:50  JKarsrud: I'm totally relaxed in my totally laid back position at 1am ;)
00:51  anthony_: when should you use ' vs " in $(".stuff"); ?
00:51  Zyci: hey guys
00:51  JKarsrud: doesn't really matter anthony_
00:51  Zyci: how's it going?
00:52  aidan: anthony_: same thing to javascript
00:52  JKarsrud: all good Zyci
00:52  JKarsrud: You?
00:52  Zyci: has anyone tried out CollabShot yet?
00:52  Zyci: trying out CollabShot
00:52  anthony_: thanks
00:56 --- cpg is now known as cpg|brb
00:57  Mafia: anyone uses teh syntaxhighlighter? any ajax brush?
00:57  JKarsrud: ajax brush?
00:57  Mafia: well it highlights code
00:57  JKarsrud: wouldn't that just be a javascript brush?
00:58  Mafia: http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/whatsnew.html
00:58  JKarsrud: Yeah, I know what a syntax highlighter is. And I know which one you're talking about. I was just wondering what an ajax brush was supposed to be?
00:58  Mafia: well js does not works fine
00:58  JKarsrud: okay?
01:00  efeel: is $('*').not(this).attr('disabled', 'disabled') and $('a').click(function(elem) { elem.preventDefault(); }  a bad way to disable elements and links on a page?
01:01  efeel: i'm essentially trying to build a very lightweight page disabler + loading screen type thing
01:01  efeel: can't use something like blockUI because of licensing issues
01:02  RTPMatt: efeel: i would say anytime you think about using $('*') you probably want to find a better solution
01:03  efeel: The thing is, I just want to disable EVERYTHING except a blessed element, like a div
01:04  RTPMatt: efeel: well, I don't really know what you are trying to do, just in general i just consider $('*') a terrible idea
01:05  JKarsrud: yeah, don't do it
01:05  Mafia: JKarsrud : {"Api_Take":{"take":{"response":{"message":"Invalid Method Call to take. Missing argument(s): user, pass."},"status":"failed"}}} will it work as a JS brush? :)
01:05  JKarsrud: Yeah, it's just JSON
01:05  Mafia: need json
01:05  JKarsrud: json = javascript, so should work just fine
01:05  Mafia: the problem is that is shows it really crappy
01:05  efeel: RTPMatt: Just display a div and disable any control elements/links on the page (i.e. the user can't do anything until an event is done. Think uploading an image or some other long-lived process)
01:05  Mafia: all in one line with the overflow-y
01:05  JKarsrud: Well, see if you find a json brush then?
01:05  Mafia: xD
01:05  Mafia: none available
01:06  Mafia: tried already ;/
01:06  JKarsrud: I guess you could manually break it then?
01:06  Mafia: yep
01:06  efeel: start event, disable everything on the page. end event, do something else
01:06  JKarsrud: Mafia: Then I guess that's your solution then ;)
01:06  efeel: It doesn't *have* to be $('*'), I know what elements are on the page (i.e. I can explicitly disable a particular form)
01:06  Mafia: XD
01:07  RTPMatt: efeel: and you can't just use like a modal overlay?
01:07  kevinSJ: I got a array that has key, value pairs and when I console.log i I get [ ] but can open it and view all content. I tried to use it in a $.post() but the parameter doesn't seem to take my array, any idea?
01:07  efeel: RTPMatt: that's what I'm trying to build (I think?) Does jquery have a method for that?
01:08  efeel: (or jqueryUI)
01:08  JKarsrud: efeel: why not just put a div as a background, with a 100% width and height that has a higher z-index than the rest of the elements?
01:09  JKarsrud: ?dialog
01:09  bot-t: JKarsrud, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
01:09  RTPMatt: efeel: jquery dialogs have a modal setting
01:09  efeel: I am actually on that page now, thanks :-)
01:12  efeel: Sweet. jQuery modal with dialog does what I need. thanks.
01:12  RTPMatt: sure thing
01:12  JKarsrud: efeel: great, now you won't have to do it yourself ;)
01:13  efeel: Yes, and more than likely, wrong, inefficient, and not very portable :-)
01:13  JKarsrud: most likely ;)
01:13  JKarsrud: no offence though :)
01:15  efeel: None taken, I'm a systems/backend programmer tasked with building a web frontend for something.
01:15  JKarsrud: Uh oh :P
01:23  kevinSJ: I've got a serialized array. Is it possible to then use it in $.post() and get positions[name] = value ?
01:24  kevinSJ: I've got the structore from serialized array. So earch array element is a set of name: value, value: value
01:25  Zyci: hey guys, have you checked out http://collabshot.com/ ?
01:34  vacho: can I with jquery check if a div is visible or not?
01:34  vacho: if( $('#foo').is(':visible') ) {
01:34  vacho: got it

01:49  temp01: semaphore: what do you think unique does
01:49  MadMaX_: I just want to make sure I'm not missing something, I don't want to store json code in a database, I want a database results to turn into json? this is all very confusing, I just made my first database and all I'd like to do is somehow put up a simple example database and call something from it, anybody know where I could learn to do this?
01:49  semaphore: i read in the docs it sorts/uniques an array of dom elements
01:50  temp01: semaphore: $('.myselect option') will never give you non-unique dom elements

01:51  semaphore: temp01: er how is that?
01:51  semaphore: at the console, i see multiple items with the same value and text
01:52  temp01: are they actually the same elements or different option elements with same value/text?
01:52  temp01: if you have <b>foo</b><b>foo</b> then they are 2 completly different elements but same text
01:52  semaphore: ..... oh
01:53  semaphore: can you suggest a work around?
01:53  semaphore: but wait, the exmaple has multiple divs with teh same class and somehow those are unique'd in an expected manner
01:54  semaphore: which are different elements with empty body
01:55  snover|away: semaphore: no?
01:55 --- snover|away is now known as snover
01:56  semaphore: snover: what temp01  says and what the example shows seem different to me
01:56  snover: temp01 is right
01:56  snover: the example concatenates two arrays containing the same elements together, then reduces the array so it no longer contains the duplicates
01:57  semaphore: oh, i missed that--
01:57  semaphore: so i guess i'm sorting it myself
01:57  snover: reading is hard, i know

01:58  MadMaX_: but then it will be part of my html file??

01:58  MadMaX_: ok
02:06  di_: how to handle only event with sortable? i'm using bind("sortupdate")  and  bind("sortreceive")
02:06  polarbear4: does anyone know of a good example of a ajax php image uploader?
02:06  di_: but sortupdate reacts always
02:06  coldhead: polarbear4: the one facebook uses is nice

02:07  coldhead: oh wait, you said PHP
02:07  polarbear4: yeah. and its just for uploading one image.
02:07  coldhead: i guess you'd need a PHP interpreter in JS so it would run in your browser
02:07  coldhead: i wonder if that exists
02:07  di_: i'm trying to handle remove,receive and change events separate
02:07  danheberden: coldhead, $.php
02:08  polarbear4: cant you just use jquery ajax to call a php file?
02:09  coldhead: thanks danheberden++
02:09  coldhead: yes you can, polarbear4
02:09  coldhead: polarbear4: i use uploadify but that's not pure ajax
02:10  coldhead: there's some fancy new one that people are all excited about but i can't recall the name
02:10  danheberden: plupload
02:10  coldhead: that sounds like you just made it up

02:25  formguy: let's say you have this error message pop up with a form.... how could you make the error messages disappear with jQuery?
02:25  formguy: I've done it with other messages, like in application.js with the simple line $(".formthing").click /etc./ to make it disappear
02:25  formguy: but it won't work for forms...I don't know why
02:25  RTPMatt: formguy: $(msg).hide()
02:26  formguy: RTPMatt: I've done that, but it doesn't work....
02:26  RTPMatt: are you sure you are selecting it correctly?
02:26  RTPMatt: console.log() you selection to make sure you actually got the right thing back
02:27  dshap: if you guys are going to asynchronously load data from a server script and then display it on the page, do you generally prefer to load raw data into JS objects (i.e. $.getJSON()) and generate the HTML client-side, or do you generate the HTML server-side and simply render what you load (i.e. $.load())?
02:27  danheberden: dshap: generate the html client side
02:27  danheberden: check out $.tmpl or mustache.js
02:28  RTPMatt: dshap: you should check out template (probablyt the jquery .tmpl plugin)
02:28  danheberden: less bandwidth to send the data then markup
02:28  danheberden: *than
02:28  dshap: good point
02:28  dshap: i need a special plugin for $.tmpl?
02:28  danheberden: it _is_ the special plugin :)
02:28  dshap: i'll just google those
02:28  dshap: yea that's what i meant
02:28  danheberden: that's the spirit
02:29  coldhead: don't use mustache.js
02:29  coldhead: it has a stupid name
02:29  dshap: another good point
02:29  danheberden: ooooh - someone can't grow a mustache
02:29  coldhead: if i were a client and you used mustache.js on my project i'd withold payment
02:29  coldhead: and any court in the world would back me up
02:29  danheberden: coldhead: you'd withhold payment anyway
02:29  dshap: lol well i don't have any clients so i'm not worried about that
02:30  coldhead: in texas i could probably get you executed for using mustache.js
02:30  coldhead: especially if i can prove you're retarderd
02:30  danheberden: coldhead: actually, that's probably the one state that that would be accepted
02:30  coldhead: which i can, by virtue of your use of mustache.hs
02:30  coldhead: j*
02:31  coldhead: oh right
02:31  coldhead: "i sentence you to death but i commute it because you have a nice mustache"
02:31  danheberden: but can you say "who wants a $.tmpl ride" ?

02:33  dshap: ok i want to get your guys' opinion on this if you don't mind...i have this facebook app that involves users browsing photos 1 by 1.  obviously i could make it super awesome by preloading the next N images and setting up some cool jQuery plugin so that they can scroll through them really quickly, but that totally kills a lot of opportunity to get impressions for ad revenue...i was thinking about some hybrid where every few photos get pre-loaded and then the wh
02:33  dshap: page needs to be loaded again for the next set.  thoughts?
02:33  formguy: wha-? I was talking about my own form problem... /HAHA/
02:34  coldhead: i'm happy for you, formguy
02:34  coldhead: ima let you finish
02:34  coldhead: zomg tldr; dshap
02:35  dshap: coldhead: come on it's like 3 sentences
02:35  coldhead: well tldr and also fuck facebook
02:35  coldhead: to be brutally honest
02:35  dshap: what makes you say fuck facebook
02:35  coldhead: my fondness for a free and open internet
02:36  coldhead: my disdain for this centuries AOL
02:36  coldhead: century's*
02:36  gjvc: coldhead, good observation
02:36  coldhead: no what you suggested sounds good, dshap
02:36  coldhead: you could still do some preloading
02:36  coldhead: and then cause a refresh every so often
02:37  dshap: just like a timer or something?
02:37  coldhead: to suck some $$ from the facebook blight
02:37  dshap: hm
02:37  dshap: yea that's the goal obviously haha
02:37  dshap: well then u got those kids who click through like 40 pics in 30 seconds
02:37  coldhead: yes or um, i'd do a reload on every Nth state change
02:37  dshap: yea i like that
02:38  coldhead: and if you preload the images
02:38  coldhead: it will still load faster and sexier
02:38  coldhead: even once you reload the page
02:38  coldhead: thanks, cache
02:38  coldhead: take 5
02:38  dshap: do i need to do something special to load them into the cache that persists between page refreshes?

02:39  MaxMeents: sorry, trying to register a username
02:40  coldhead: dshap: if facebook is serving the images you can probably rely on them to have sensible headers
02:40  coldhead: to save their bandwidth
02:40  coldhead: so beyond that, no, if you load an image and subsequently refer to that same URL it should come out of the cache, browser willing
02:40  dshap: coldhead: they are serving the images, but i'm choosing the images to load - they don't know which ones i want until i request them
02:40  coldhead: that's okay
02:40  coldhead: just preload and forget

02:41  compufreak: uhh...
02:41  coldhead: it will show that it got them out of the cache if its working
02:41  compufreak: Maybe not
02:41  dshap: compufreak: what was that about setting cache headers
02:41  compufreak: On pictures in peoples' profiles there's the no-cache header
02:41  compufreak: coldhead: "Cache-Control:max-age=0, no-cache"
02:42  coldhead: oh, well in that case, to return to my earlier point, fuck facebook
02:42  compufreak: ;)
02:42  coldhead: THANKS FOR NOTHING, FACEBOOK
02:43  dshap: wait so if i create JS image objects and have the src point to a facebook-served image, you're saying the browser won't cache it?
02:43  compufreak: Any ideas on fixing the text problem?  http://illegal3alien.kodingen.com/accordion/
02:44  compufreak: dshap: yep
02:44  dshap: compufreak: so what's the solution.  have my server download it from facebook and then re-serve to my users?
02:44  compufreak: dshap: maybe download them all and use
02:45  compufreak: AJAX to cycle through pics and ads
02:46  dshap: compufreak: i'm like 100% new to ad publishing.  can you load ads with AJAX and count them as impressions?
02:46  dshap: compufreak: i guess there's no real way for them to know the difference whether they're on a new page refresh or just called asynchronously huh
02:46  compufreak: dshap: I guess it depends on how the ad determines the page
02:47  dshap: compufreak: doubt i could do that with Adsense
02:47  compufreak: have ads.html with the ad code. Use .load to drop the contents into a div
02:48  compufreak: Preload like 3 images and then each time the image is cycled to the next preload one more
02:50 --- cip is now known as chipnt
02:52  dshap: compufreak: i like it.  thanks
03:02  NET_: hmm, with jquery templates, how do i get by if a value i'm looking for is undefined?
03:02  dshap: compufreak: btw, not seeing cache-control header in google chrome's resource tracker when i direct-load a photo from facebook
03:05  RTPMatt: NET_: you can use an if stament to chack if it is undefined in your template

03:08  wesbos: hey guys
03:08  wesbos: I've got a UL with 3 UL nest inside of it (a navigation)
03:08  RTPMatt: HI WESVOS!
03:08  wesbos: I want to tigger something only when the top level  UL LI  is hovered on
03:09  wesbos: HEY MAN
03:09  RTPMatt: (sorry i mispelled your name)
03:09  wesbos: #nav ul > li  doesnt seem to trigger it
03:09  wesbos: its okay, I know a bunch of Vos's
03:10  RTPMatt: you can put it on the .hover for the top level, then in each of the sub ones, do a return false; in their handler
03:10  coldhead: ?w voss
03:10  bot-t: coldhead, Voss - is a municipality in Hordaland county, Norway. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voss
03:10  coldhead: ?w voss (novel)
03:10  bot-t: coldhead, Voss (novel) - Voss (1957) is the fifth published novel of Patrick White. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voss_(novel)
03:10  wesbos: yeah I could, but isnt there a way to select just the top level ones?
03:11  compufreak: dshap: under Resources > Headers, down near the bottom?
03:11  wesbos: I'd rather not write a return false tfor the other two levels
03:11  dshap: compufreak: right, im looking at the response header
03:11  dshap: headers*
03:11  RTPMatt: you could do $(toplevel).children().hover(function(){return false;});
03:12  RTPMatt: that hould fix it
03:12  compufreak: dshap: If they are set it should give max-age or expiration dat
03:12  compufreak: e
03:12  compufreak: dshap: the uploaded photos had them specifically set to no-cache
03:13  compufreak: dshap: profile pictures didn't have them set
03:13  dshap: compufreak: what does this mean
03:13  dshap: X-Cache:MISS from 10.240.20.12, MISS from 172.19.134.2
03:13  dshap: X-Cache-Lookup:HIT from 172.19.134.2:3128
03:14  compufreak: 1/3 things in cache matched the server so it didn't download I think
03:15  dshap: 3 things?  it was just a request for a single image
03:15  compufreak: Must be checking multiple servers then
03:15  dshap: ah
03:15  compufreak: You have a caching proxy?
03:15  dshap: not sure
03:15  dshap: im actually on an airplane right now
03:15  dshap: haha
03:16  compufreak: It's very possible they have a proxy running that caches stuff to save bandwidth
03:16  dshap: who knows what could be going on w/this connection
03:16  dshap: gotcha
03:16  compufreak: Port 3128 is not standard
03:16  dshap: meh, shouldn't inhibit my pre-loading adventures
03:19  compufreak: dshap: net says gogo runs a squid proxy which probably caches junk
03:20  dshap: compufreak: looks like i will have to reinvestigate when i get home then
03:26  shazmoh: What's the possible explanation of this feature in Javascript: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4261496/scope-of-self-invocation-function-in-javascript
03:26  shazmoh: Self-invocation functions always having the 'global' scope?
03:28  coldhead: not if they're nested inside another function
03:28  coldhead: ?eval (function () {var x = 'lol';})(); x;
03:28  bot-t: coldhead: ReferenceError: x is not defined
03:28  coldhead: is that what you meant?
03:28  coldhead: or
03:29  coldhead: ?eval x=101;(function () {alert(x)})();
03:29  bot-t: coldhead: 101
03:29  shazmoh: coldhead: speaking to me?
03:29  coldhead: vaguely
03:30  coldhead: is not clear what you mean by "[have] the global scope"
03:30  shazmoh: coldhead: means its executed in the 'global' scope, no matter what the scope of the outer function is
03:31  shazmoh: or 'this' inside the self invocation is always 'global'
03:32  coldhead: shazmoh: i think 'this' will always be window, no matter how deeply dested your functions are
03:33  coldhead: but its only my first day using jQuery
03:33  snover: you could use .call on the function to rebind 'this' inside the function
03:34  snover: otherwise, the value of 'this' is determined by the object that the function is attached to
03:34  shazmoh: i'm clear about, how to change the scope if needed.. but looking for a proper explanation in terms of JS language design, why the self invocation functions are ignoring the scope of the outer functions
03:35  RTPMatt: kind of odd to have a self executinf function as an object property, no?
03:35  coldhead: ?eval (function () {var this = 'sexy'; (function () {alert(this);})();})()
03:35  bot-t: coldhead: SyntaxError: missing variable name
03:35  coldhead: oops
03:36  RTPMatt: I would say the explination is because you can then pass whatever you want into it maybe?  but other than that it is just the way the spec says it should be
03:37  snover: RTPMatt: not at all
03:37  coldhead: i would recommend not using functions, to avoid 'this' confusion
03:37  snover: RTPMatt: It makes sense *if* what you are trying to do is generate a value that gets set as the property
03:37  snufft: RTPMatt: i know the use of .next() is involved, but how does it know not to get the first element in the list to begin with?
03:38  snover: like, var event = { add: (function () { return window.addEventListener || window.attachEvent; }()) }; or something
03:38  shazmoh: RTPMatt: is there a link to the "spec" that you mentioned
03:38  haq: hmm, how would you perform an action after something has been entered into an input(text) field?
03:38  haq: would keydown be the ticket?
03:39  shazmoh: Specific ECMAScript page... if possible!
03:39  RTPMatt: uh, yeah, ECMAScript
03:39  coldhead: ?change @ haq
03:39  bot-t: haq, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
03:39  haq: ah, so change works on input too, okie
03:40  haq: i wasn't sure if it was just select or not, but i must've messed something else up=)
03:40  haq: (er input text)
03:40  coldhead: good luck haq
03:40  haq: thanks coldhead
03:40  haq: =)
03:44  ProLoser|Work: hello
03:45  RTPMatt: if that is how browsers do it, seeing the spec is unhelpful, it tells just how things should be done.  feel free to peruse the spec http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf
03:45  RTPMatt: or 5th http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf
03:46  compufreak: Do something to everything without certain class?
03:46  ProLoser|Work: could anyone tell me why line 207 of ISVOnline.js isn't firing? http://74.212.246.74/
03:47  shazmoh: RTPMatt: Got it
03:49  trollboy: so who wants to see something I'm building to teach myself jquery for fun?
03:49  trollboy: I'd love tips, suggestions, etc
03:49  RTPMatt: trollboy: lets see it!
03:49  trollboy: http://shoggoth.net/chargen/chargen.html
03:49  trollboy: there's a couple bugs I got to fix, but that's as far as I'm gunna get without backend support
03:49  RTPMatt: haha! nice
03:50  trollboy: its the start of a call of cthulhu character sheet generator
03:51  RTPMatt: if you are looking for tips, i can try
03:51  trollboy: totally
03:51  RTPMatt: where you do this:
03:52  RTPMatt: it is better to cache the result of $(old_san_target) to the var so you can re use it, so you dont have to jqueryify it twice
03:52  doc_lee: Has anybody created a nested list populated by ajax using jquery mobile?
03:52  RTPMatt: rather than just caching the string
03:53  doc_lee: Still can't figure this darn thing out
03:54  RTPMatt: also, using $(selector).change inside of your $(function(){... id prefered over using onchange directly on the DOM nodes
03:54  coldhead: javascript is so simple but i don't understand anything at all
03:55  RTPMatt: it cleans up your global namespace and helps remove your code from you markup
03:55  trollboy: how would I cache the var? I don't follow there
03:55  ProLoser|Work: anyone here use ui tabs?
03:55  trollboy: ProLoser|Work, I do
03:55  ProLoser|Work: for the load event, what are the 2 objects for?
03:55  ProLoser|Work:  load: function(event, ui) {
03:55  RTPMatt: i just mean where you are doing var san_target = '#sanbox span:contains(' + $('#Power').val() * 5 + ')';
03:56  ProLoser|Work: do either of these represent the loaded in DOM? should i be reselecting the new dom in order to reduce selector scope?
03:56  RTPMatt: make it var san_target = $('#sanbox span:contains(' + $('#Power').val() * 5 + ')');
03:57  RTPMatt: then you can use
03:57  RTPMatt: san_target.css('text-weight', 'bold');
03:58  RTPMatt: san_target.css('color', '#FF0000');
03:58  trollboy: ah gotcha
03:58  ProLoser|Work: does anyone know?
03:58  RTPMatt: but actually in that case, i think you can use $('#sanbox span:contains(' + $('#Power').val() * 5 + ')').css({'text-weight': 'bold', 'color': '#FF0000'});
03:59  RTPMatt: move it all into 1 line
03:59  trollboy: Cool i'll do that, i figured there was a one liner..
03:59  trollboy: hey question for you on a bug with that actually
04:00  RTPMatt: shoot
04:00  trollboy: try changing the power to 5
04:00  haq: eh.. what does bubble mean?
04:00  trollboy: Magic Points == Power
04:01  trollboy: and in the check boxes the current score is highlighted red
04:02  trollboy: but when you change it to 5, you'll see every multiple of 5 in the magic points box turn red, as opposed to just 5
04:02  RTPMatt: so it should change is the problem?
04:02  trollboy: It should highlight the 5 alone
04:02  trollboy: but it highlights every number that's got a 5 in it
04:02  RTPMatt: im colorblind..kinda hard to see that ;) but yeah, i see a bunch or colored
04:03  trollboy: AH, sorry
04:03  trollboy: Should I try text-weight: bolder as well?
04:03  RTPMatt: np
04:03  RTPMatt: yeah, that would be really nice for people like me
04:03  trollboy: I didn't even think of color blindness, I feel like an ass
04:04  RTPMatt: naw it is cool, as long as you dont ask me if I only see black and white we are cool
04:04  trollboy: lol
04:08  RTPMatt: trollboy: are you using firebug?
04:09  trollboy: yeah
04:10  RTPMatt: if you type debugger; at the top of processPower() it will stop there and let you step through it so you can see when/why it stop there
04:11  RTPMatt: sorry, the wife wants me to go watch some TV with her, so I can't help you much longer
04:14  trollboy: no worries, thanks!
04:15  RTPMatt: yeah, no problem, always nice when someone is here to just learn!
04:15  RTPMatt: im off
04:18  ProLoser|Work: unbind is unbinding too many things, how can i make sure it only unbinds specific behaviors?
04:23  acidjazz: wats the best way to bind an input box to do something upon the enter key being hit?
04:23  acidjazz: jquery have something built in?
04:25  haq: Ahh, can someone tell me why this works, $('.worklog form') but not $('.small_input_box input[type=text]')  (i have to do: $('.small_input_box:input[type=text]') )
04:29  compufreak: How can I find out if a clicked object is before or after #other-object?
04:30  zuez: Where in the jQuery API should I be looking if I want to take a reference of everything contained in an element?
04:31  zuez: I basically have something like <div id="foo"><span id="somespan">stuff</span></div>, I want to get a hold of #somespan and later remove everything inside of id=foo and put somespan back
04:32  zuez: I think it's .html() actually, never mind.
04:34  RTPMatt: compufreak: what do you mean before or after?
04:34  RTPMatt: there is contains and closest?
04:35  RTPMatt: contains looks down the DOM, contains looks up it
04:35  RTPMatt: or maybe find insead of contains
05:00  TheIronSky: !@#R$#%TYTU
05:06  disappearedng: Is there a way I can get a window to scroll to a particular height? height is some node's left and top

05:11  RTPMatt: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
05:11  disappearedng: yeah but then it's 2007
05:12  RTPMatt: something, when done do not need to be updated ;)

05:29  ner0x: Is there a way to test if a div has two classes?
05:30  ner0x: $("div.class").hasClass("otherClass").click( function() {} ); etc.
05:33  bananasontoast: Hey guys, just written some nifty JS to do some magic on some lists. Is there a way I can target a single level of list elements and not any of it's children using an each function? Like, inside the each statement can I test if it's a child of the level I am trying to target?
05:35  danheberden: var level = $('ul.yourClass')[0];... in your each: if( this.parentNode == level ) { /* yay! */
05:35  danheberden: but if you're calling the each, why not just from it's parent?
05:35  danheberden: like $('ul > li').each..
05:36  coldhead: and notorious homo
05:36 * danheberden claps emphatically 
05:36  buddyq: bananasontoast, $('ul li').nth-child(2) will select the second li of all ul's
05:37  bananasontoast: danheberden: Sorry guys, I'm not explaining myself well...
05:37  coldhead: won't it subtract child(2) from a property "nth" ?
05:37  bananasontoast: Sorry, that was for all...
05:37  danheberden: buddyq: that's not a function
05:37  danheberden: nth-child is a slector
05:37  danheberden: $('ul li:nth-child(2)')
05:37  buddyq: oh sorry... its a filter so it should be $('ul li:nth-child(2))
05:37  danheberden: though just use eq
05:38  danheberden: either :eq(2) or $('ul li').eq(2)
05:38  danheberden: to get the THIRD
05:39  bananasontoast: I need a list that has first level as an integer (1, 2, 3 etc.) second level as a decimal (1.1, 1.2, 1.2 etc.) and a third level that has lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, etc.)... this is the script I came up with... but it's not just effecting the second level... http://pastebin.com/c9CGKNBF

05:49  antipop: Hi, I'm tring to check a form with several inputs , using if ($("input:text").val().length < 3) {
05:50  bananasontoast: I know I can use the CSS counter attribute, but that doesn't work in IE6 and IE7
05:50  antipop: but this only checks the first input, how can I check all of them???
05:50  tori: $("input:text").get()
05:50  tori: returns an array of jQuery oejbjects
05:51  tori: ($("input:text").val().length < 3) {
05:51  tori: gah
05:51  bananasontoast: buddyq and coldhead: is that making sense? :S
05:51  tori: hold on
05:51  buddyq: bananasontoast, thinking...but seems like you're making it hard on yourself. Why don't you use the nth-child and then just add a class and keep the styles in your stylesheet instead of injecting crappy inline styles?
05:52  coldhead: $('*').text('GIRL I WANT YOU')
05:52  tori: antipop: Iterate through the array: $("input:text")get()[i].val().length < 3) {
05:52  antipop: what about $("input:text").each(function(index) { ?
05:52  bananasontoast: buddyq: Maybe - could be a better solution...
05:52  tori: antipop: That will work too.
05:53  Cliyeh: hello, can someone pls help me on the collapsible tab jquery code.
05:53  Cliyeh: is it possible to hide the loading tabs at start?

05:53  antipop: although I need to set a variable inside that, so how can I pass a variable to the each mehtod?
05:53  buddyq: bananasontoast, is 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 supposed to be letters?
05:54  bananasontoast: buddyq: No - letters are good.... 2.1, 2.2 instead of the second level of numbers...
05:54  bananasontoast: First level: 1,2,3
05:54  bananasontoast: Second level: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
05:54  bananasontoast: Third level: a,b,c

05:54  tori: antipop: I think this may be what you are looking for. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works#Callback_with_arguments
05:54  buddyq: right....should be easy...
05:54  buddyq: you just take the number and add .Number
05:54  tori: Although, you're not readlly doing a callback.
05:54  tori: Wait
05:55  tori: Hmm..
05:55  antipop: ok, thanks tori
05:55  tori: See if that works. I have a doubt, but I may be correct.
05:55  bananasontoast: Well... You just need to change the index from Index to ParentIndex.Index

06:04  antipop: trying
06:04  buddyq: antipop, that's it? Just make label red?
06:04  antipop: yes
06:04  tori: antipop: I'm thinking your code needs some boolean algebra to achieve proper error storing.
06:04  bananasontoast: buddyq: Yep, but if you go to 3.1, 3.2 etc. they are just showing as 1, 2
06:05  antipop: toru, I ned to pass the "eeror"variable to the function
06:05  antipop: "error"
06:05  tori: wait, ignore me. I propabbly spoke too soon/too complicated.
06:05  antipop: then I set error to false and I do an OR
06:05  buddyq: did I fix it?
06:05  buddyq: bananasontoast,?
06:05  coldhead: yay for jesus!
06:05  buddyq: coldhead, are you working on the same thing with bananasontoast?
06:05  gnarf: sounds to me like you wanted to color the prev label for EACH element?
06:05  gnarf: or just for the form?
06:06  bananasontoast: buddyq: Not quite. It certainly targets the right level now, but it also doesn't work on the 3rd level of the top list... From "3. Sales of products and comissions" onwards the lists are just in their default state...
06:06  coldhead: buddyq: no, i have everyone in here on ignore, i'm just typing at random

06:27  SeriousJonny: since yesterday iam playing around with it ^^
06:27  coldhead: SeriousJonny: i'm not allowed to use Aptana
06:27  SeriousJonny: whys that :X
06:27  coldhead: it is too complicated and management says it would "waste time"

06:28  SeriousJonny: after heavy modification you dont even need a mouse for it i guess ^^
06:28  bananasontoast: buddyq: Any luck so far? :-)
06:29  SeriousJonny: but where is the problem to use the mouse anyway? :D
06:29  SeriousJonny: the buildin jq api is really handy

06:41  Snerf: what do you mean?
06:41  coldhead: can you give me a link
06:41  coldhead: where i can see it
06:41  coldhead: on the internet
06:42  coldhead: so i can see what is wrong
06:42  Snerf: sorry, its in a private site which requires login
06:42  coldhead: instead of guessing
06:42  Snerf: let me paste some code
06:42  coldhead: aw fug
06:42  ocf: writing code to emulate an accordion, but instead of .click, I'm using .hover. When I leave the header div to hover over the contents of the second div, obviously my second div disappears. How do I mitigate this?

06:43  coldhead: ?g hoverintent @ ocf

06:43  Snerf: http://pastebin.com/h21NQjD1  <- quite simple really
06:44  coldhead: yes snerf but i can't see what CSS rules its inheriting
06:44  coldhead: which is where the rub may lie
06:44  Snerf: hmm. right
06:45  snufft: why would you remove elements from the dom, in say the case of a rotating gallery? ie, you remove elements, then add them in, as needed
06:45  coldhead: Snerf: do you know how to inspect styles with firebug or your favourite equivalent?
06:45  Snerf: coldhead, no I do not
06:45  coldhead: Snerf: do you have chrome?
06:45  Snerf: yes I do
06:46  coldhead: right click on the house and choose Inspect Element
06:46  Snerf: ok
06:46  coldhead: on the right you should see all the styles
06:46  coldhead: try unchceking and rechecking lines to see what might be breaking it
06:46  coldhead: especially float lines
06:46  coldhead: and display
06:46  coldhead: good luck!
06:47  Snerf: oh, wow, thats so cool.. I didnt know chrome could do that :)
06:47  coldhead: very powerful, Snerf
06:47  coldhead: also good for testing code fragments at the console
06:47  coldhead: and you can edit live pages
06:47  Snerf: how do you uncheck a line tho?
06:47  coldhead: checkbox on the right?
06:48  SeriousJonny: so upped it
06:48  SeriousJonny: well

06:48  coldhead: cheers, SeriousJonny
06:49  SeriousJonny: www.ewein.at
06:49  SeriousJonny: was the original
06:52  buddyq: bananasontoast, can you add a class?
06:52  SeriousJonny: so much todo :/
06:52  ocf: coldhead - I'm not sure if the hoverintent works for what I want (maybe it does, but I'm not seeing it). I simply want to make the animate displaying the 2nd div, and if you mouseoff the 1st div, mousing on the 2nd div, the 2nd div stays visible. Can't that be done in base jquery/UI?
06:53  ocf: http://www.jsfiddle.net/eJfep/ in case anyone wants to take a look
06:54  bananasontoast: buddyq: I guess I could if I had to... perhaps there is no other way?
06:54  Snerf: coldhead, seems it was in the ui.custom.css, it was displaying ui.icon as display:block
06:55  trollboy: Hey guys; Need some help with this: http://pastebin.ca/2000735
06:55  coldhead: good job, Snerf
06:55  Brodingo: http://www.jsfiddle.net/eJfep/1/
06:55  Brodingo: ?
06:55  coldhead: spend some time with the chrome web inspector, it will save you dayyys
06:55  Brodingo: ocf?
06:55  Snerf: coldhead , thanks a bunch, that really helps a GREAT deal in debugging :)
06:55  coldhead: esp. with ajaxy stuff
06:55  coldhead: zomg
06:55  coldhead: so testy
06:56  Snerf: ya, but I love it, this jquery stuff is a blast
06:57  coldhead: ocf: i'd use hover intent, but you can sometimes make it work by making sure your hover selector applies to all the elements, i.e.: $('.diva, .divb').hover();
06:57  coldhead: .hover(...) even
06:57  ocf: Brodingo - worked on jsfiddle, didn't work on my site. will debug
06:58  Brodingo: also, return false in a hover?
06:58  ocf: coldhead - hard to do if you're using $(this).next...
06:58  ocf: Brodingo - got it from jqueryUI.com's accordion text
06:58  Brodingo: hmm
07:00  Brodingo: ocf did you see i changed it two places? the initial selection and in the function
07:00  ocf: yeah I just copied your code straight from jsfiddle into my js script tag
07:00 --- cjm is now known as cjmFloating
07:02 --- cjmFloating is now known as cjm
07:03  ocf: Brodingo - I got it. There are 20 some div's inside of the accordion. Just had an incorrectly nested tag
07:03  Brodingo: cool beans
07:03  ocf: thx
07:03  ocf: hmm
07:04  buddyq: bananasontoast, there's a way... creative selecting... i'm working on it still. Good challenge.
07:04  ocf: I added header class to 2nd item. Obv when I hover over either of the 2, both $(this).find('.header').next().toggle('slow') events fire
07:04  bananasontoast: buddyq: Hehe, I'll say! I'm still trying things too...
07:04  ocf: I could just change them to ID's and repeat
07:06  Superman_: I just create a read more widget in which i'm clicking the read more button and its slides down. But I want that when once I clicked it the click event doesn't work again with this button??
07:06  Superman_: any thoughts
07:06  bananasontoast: buddyq: What about testing how many parents it has using parents() ?
07:08  ocf: Brodingo - i'm failing epically on this. To reiterate - when I add a 'header' class to my second header, if I hover over any individual header, they all expand. Thoughts?
07:10 --- cjm is now known as cjmFloating
07:10  Brodingo: because the event is tied to the parent element so any header elements that are in it are triggered
07:10  ocf: right, I totally get that, but I'm stuck on figuring out how to fix it
07:11  ocf: I have an id on each of the header divs, so I was going to hack it and just use those
07:11  Brodingo: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-popup-bubbles/
07:12  ocf: guessing that wasn't for me :-D
07:12  Brodingo: no it was

07:32  SeriousJonny: no privacy
07:32  SeriousJonny: nothing left
07:32  Cork: SeriousJonny: well... internet hasn't really ever been about privacy though
07:32  SeriousJonny: "Make the Web faster" there slogan, hah i laugh... Its just so that they can parse pages faster, to categorize Humans ^^
07:33  iszak: SeriousJonny, my god adblock plus in GC is bad if you go to certain sites, it leaks out of it's anus.
07:33  iszak: but essentially Cork is right.
07:34  SeriousJonny: gc?
07:34  iszak: Google Chrome.
07:34  SeriousJonny: i dun use chrome ^^
07:34  SeriousJonny: firefox
07:34  iszak: GC + Adblock + Techcrunch => ~460 MB for the home page.
07:35  SeriousJonny: oha
07:35  Cork: SeriousJonny: just to make it clear, i do agree with you though ;)
07:35  Cork: SeriousJonny: its just about correcting the facts :)
07:35  dr0id: coldhead: this channel has lost humour :(
07:35  SeriousJonny: Well the worst part is ther PageRanking just a Monopol for big Industry nothing else
07:36  iszak: TechCrunch + Google Chrome + No Adblock => ~110 MB for the home page.
07:36  iszak: GC memory usage in general is quite high.
07:37  maestrojed: I want to load jquery if it has not already been loaded. I am not overly concerned with the version. I want to keep it simple. My research lead me to implement this http://pastebin.com/Wpdkzvej but that only works in FF. Any suggestions?
07:40  iszak: maestrojed, that won't work if they've got noConflict true enabled :P
07:41  iszak: ?source
07:41  bot-t: jQuery 1.4 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.js
07:41  iszak: or will it?
07:41  iszak: no, don't think it will.
07:43  talented: maestrojed, why would jquery not be defined?
07:43 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
07:44  maestrojed: talented: The scope of the project calls for embedable code that can work in a multitude of environments.
07:44  maestrojed: iszak: i have it workint in noConflict environments but in FF.
07:44  maestrojed: iszak But now I doubt myself. I am going to go check
07:44  maestrojed: either way I need a more solid solution
07:45  talented: maestrojed, use a try catch statement
07:45  talented: usually undefined can cause execution to stop in some scripting engines
07:46  talented: ... some... I mean IE
07:46  maestrojed: TY! I will give it a try and research it.

07:47  Superman_: how to disable a button after first time clicking it?
07:47  SeriousJonny: doesnt scrollTop scroll to top?
07:47  SeriousJonny: $(this).scrollTop(0)?
07:47  Superman_: so that it can't launch any event
07:48  talented: Superman_, use a class
07:49  talented: click it and turn on the class
07:49  Superman_: ok :)
07:49  SeriousJonny: $('body').scrollTop i guess
07:49  Superman_: I was looking for something like event can't propogate further after first time clicking
07:49  Superman_: ??
07:49  Superman_: is there any way to do it in this way
07:50 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
07:50  SeriousJonny: now i got it
07:50  SeriousJonny: html,body
07:52  talented: Superman_, you could also store data about the click so that it can't be triggered again, or at least after some timeout
07:52  Superman_: I just want that when I click it once It doesn't launch the click event again
07:53  Superman_: right now I'm hiding the button after first click
07:53  talented: well, disabling the button will definitely cause that
07:53  talented: as no event will work after that
07:53  Superman_: yep
07:53  talented: and to re-enable it, means using an event from somewhere else, or a timeout function
07:54  Superman_: http://jsfiddle.net/Superman/Kz5VY/
07:54  Superman_: look at it
07:54  Superman_: and try to remove the .hide() you'll see that it keep on repeating itself
07:55  Superman_: as it should have to do.. actually I'm just want to learn if there is any way in jquery to handle it like that
07:55  SeriousJonny: so wich one is the safest option html,body,window,document.scrollTop()?
07:55  talented: well, once the click happens do you want it to continue or stop once it's done it's thing?
07:56  SeriousJonny: guess i stick with document since it works on ff,chrome,ie
08:00  cylence: I'm getting a XSS error between a domain and a virtualhost subdomain on the same domain. I thought that things on the same domain would work for ajax?
08:00  danheberden: using a relative path?
08:01  cylence: no, they are two separate web apps.
08:01  cylence: one at sub.domain.com and domain.com (where domain.com has the script making the ajax call to sub.domain.com)
08:01  danheberden: those are two different domains :D
08:01  cylence: meh, hehe
08:01  cylence: how can I get around that?
08:01  cylence: or can I?
08:02  danheberden: jsonp's a simple answer
08:02  Superman_: anybody can tell me how this code is working ??

08:02  dilvie: Hello. =)
08:02  cylence: danheberden: its an installation of the horrible vbulletin software
08:02 * danheberden shudders
08:03  cylence: hehe, exactly
08:03  cylence: danheberden: trying to allow votes through an ajax call
08:03  cylence: I have it working with a regular form submission
08:03  danheberden: i'd google it to death
08:03  danheberden: (the question, that is)
08:03  cylence: so, would a virtualhost of domain.com/forum work?
08:04  cylence: danheberden: yeah, been looking, but I'm only getting people with genuinely different hosts
08:04  cylence: can I even setup a ServerName with a slash? :s

08:10  SeriousJonny: dun works

08:16  danheberden: sweet

08:16  danheberden: heh heh
08:16  ocf: not for long, if I can help it :|
08:16  danheberden: drove out there this morning
08:16  ocf: whereabouts you at?
08:16  danheberden: i'm out by tanasbourne
08:16  ocf: oh yeah I was just at the REI & Old Spaghetti Factory the other night
08:16  danheberden: heh - small world
08:16  ocf: no doubt
08:17  ocf: whatta you do out here?
08:18  danheberden: lately, work :(
08:18  ocf: employed or on your own?
08:18  danheberden: on my own
08:18  ocf: yeah me too
08:18  danheberden: now that the weather is cooperating, i'll be hitting the mountain hopefully
08:18  dilvie: does .draggable provide any way to reset the position to before drag without doing it automatically when the element gets dropped?
08:19  danheberden: dilvie - like besides just using the event data?
08:20  ocf: what kind of coding do you do? I know a few guys who are always looking for resources
08:21  dilvie: danheberden: Which event data?
08:21 --- bananasontoast is now known as b[a]nanasontoast
08:21  danheberden: dilvie - the drag event
08:21  danheberden: ocf - php/mysql and pretty much anything front-end
08:22  danheberden: lots 'n lots of javascript
08:22  ocf: you work with social media at all?
08:23  danheberden: not much, no
08:26  ocf: looking for work, or too busy?
08:29  danheberden: been trying to decide if i wanna get back into a 'job' or not
08:29  danheberden: but right now, too busy
08:30  ocf: heh yeah me too. started looking, ended up finding two more 1099 ongoing project work jobs :|
08:30  dilvie: Looks like ui.position is what I'm after. =)
08:31  danheberden: i need a job that pays me rediculously well and is cool with me spending half my time on the jquery project :p
08:31  danheberden: dilvie: there ya go :)
08:31  ocf: lol. I'd rather make what I'm making now, but in a SaaS model that requires <1 hr/day support :-D
08:32  dilvie: I took a J-O-B
08:34  dilvie: It's a really good fit for my skills, and I like the location and the steady paycheck.
08:34  dilvie: It's in Miami.
08:34  danheberden: constant pay, benies, 401k.. oh it _is_ tempting
08:34  dilvie: oh yeah. I have health insurance for the first time in almost two years.
08:35  ocf: yeah, that definitely has a lot of appeal
08:35  dilvie: Good thing I didn't need any surgeries while I was not covered.
08:35  ocf: http://www.jsfiddle.net/eJfep/4/ - I know WHY both events are firing, but I don't know how to code it so only the initial div I hover over displays its content div. thoughts?
08:36  dilvie: This is my first "real" job in about 10 years.
08:36  dilvie: I've always kinda done my own thing until now.
08:36  ocf: yeah dilvie I worry about that, between snowshoeing, backpacking, rafting, etc
08:36  ocf: paid time off... mmmm num num
08:37  dilvie: My answer to paid time off has always been to run my own revenue-generating websites.
08:37  dilvie: Which is still not a bad strategy, IMO.
08:38  ocf: dilvie - thats been my idea too. I've just never entered that market, so any pointers you can give me... ;)
08:38  talented: ocf, you'll definitely make an accordion out of that code
08:38  ocf: talented - yeah I tried that angle too
08:38  talented: no, I mean with finding that class, then once it opens, that class is no longer hovered
08:39  talented: so it'll be back and forth
08:39  ocf: but its using images & text in the header, and I wasn't able to get that working right, especially with the hover. So I figured I'd just go this route
08:39  talented: once it expands the div, you're no long hovering it
08:39  talented: but, I guess you want to solve the opening of both divs
08:39  ocf: I want this to execute on hover, not on click
08:40  talented: mouseover!
08:40  talented: not hover
08:40  ocf: so on the div itself, use onmouseover?
08:40  ocf: or use mouseover in jquery?
08:41  talented: well, you can delegate it to the whole div if you want
08:41  ocf: guess I didn't realize there was a mouseover until now
08:41  ocf: only the oldschool <div onmouseover=function>
08:42  ocf: wont' I run into the same problem?
08:42  danheberden: odc - you could attach the event to just .header
08:42  danheberden: instead of accordion
08:42  danheberden: *ocf
08:42  ocf: when I mouseover the initial div, then move to the newly shown content div, won't I lose the div?
08:42  danheberden: ugh, brain is getting tired
08:42  m0dmd: good night everyone
08:42  danheberden: ocf - see ?hoverIntent
08:42  bot-t: danheberden, hoverIntent | jQuery Plugins - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
08:42  danheberden: might help
08:42  m0dmd: night night people!
08:42  m0dmd: lata dan
08:42  danheberden: 'night m0dmd
08:42  ocf: danheberden - I had that initially, but then someone here changed it to this method (with find('.header')
08:43  talented: ocf, just looking at... it's really unexpected behaviour that you're forcing the user into
08:43  ocf: yeah coldhead pointed me to hoverIntent as well. It just seemed complicated for what I figtured would be something really simple
08:43  talented: it looks like a link, you goto it... and it opens up strangely
08:43  liquidcms: sorry.. likely trivial.. but... why does this work... $('#' + this).hide();
08:43  ocf: talented - hovering over a menu, and having it "pop out" a submenu? I wonder if I should re-evaluate and just turn this into a straight UL structure. I didn't create the initial code. They just asked me to fix bugs
08:43  dilvie: ocf: use delegate, listen on accordian, and target the header elements directly.
08:44  liquidcms: when this is a id string
08:44  liquidcms: but this doesn't $(this).hide();
08:44  liquidcms: when string is the same as first case but with # in the front
08:45  liquidcms: so case 1 this = "test" and case 2 this = "#test"
08:45  liquidcms: ok..maybe not trivial then.. :(
08:46  talented: are you overwriting this?
08:46  dilvie: ocf: as for the money-making-websites market, the sky is the limit, there. Build something useful, get a bunch of users on board, and then start a premium account (freemium model), or start showing ads.
08:46  danheberden: ocf - this might help, btw
08:46  danheberden: http://www.jsfiddle.net/eJfep/5/
08:47  ocf: dilvie - yeah my problem has always been analysis paralysis I think. There are a million $1 million ideas. I'm sure, someday, I'll look back and realize how much of an idiot I was (cough am, not was)
08:47  dilvie: I've done one that reached a million visitors monthly, and a few others that were in the hundreds of thousands monthly... the first made enough to replace a full-time job. A couple of the others made part-time job money, and more than a few made a tiny trickle. Make a few, spread the word, see what takes.
08:47  talented: liquidcms, you're not trying to over the keyword "this" are you?
08:48  liquidcms: over?
08:48  talented: override
08:48  liquidcms: i am using this since this is part of .each loop
08:48  dilvie: ocf: don't analyze. Code. Release. Test with users. Iterate or put on back burner. Rinse, repeat.
08:48  liquidcms:  $.each(mypage, function() {      $(this).hide();
08:49  talented: $(this) is part of each loop... this refers to owner of the function in js
08:49  dilvie: ocf: Ideas are crap. Just do something and see what happens. If nothing happens, do something else.
08:49  liquidcms: so pass it an array with ["#test1", "#test2"]
08:49 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
08:49  ocf: dilvie - yeah I know. I just need to execute on SOMETHING. eventually I'll figure out what that is :)
08:50  liquidcms: as opposed to using ["test1", "test2"] with $('#' + this).hide();
08:50  liquidcms: that works.. other one doesnt
08:51  talented: so why are you iterating over them, what does your function do, apart from also hiding the element?
08:51  ocf: danheberden - that's much closer, but I still have the problem of mouseout.
08:51  talented: also in this case, you'll probably be better of adding a class to hide the element over using hide()
08:51  ocf: dilvie - same issue with using delegate. It works great, except when I mouseout of the header, into the content area, my content div disappears
08:51  liquidcms: i have a bunch of elements
08:52  liquidcms: and i loop through and hide them
08:52  liquidcms: thats it, thats all
08:52  liquidcms: lol.. .hide() works
08:52  dilvie: It's not the million dollar idea that counts. It's the weekend you spend launching SOMETHING.
08:52  dilvie: OCF: I have a friend who lives large on a project he built in less than a month over ten years ago.
08:52  dilvie: OCF: cooltext.com
08:52  dilvie: the styles *look* ten years old, but he's still doing well, ten years later.
08:52  dilvie: ocf: bind mouseenter
08:52  dilvie: but not mouseleave
08:52  talented: hide() is slow
08:52  talented: in fact, a lot of the css styling is slow in jquery
08:52  liquidcms: this is not about the function..just trying to find out why $('#' + this) works and $(this) doesnt
08:53  danheberden: ocf: you want it like a dropdown basically?
08:53  danheberden: over-shows, out-hides
08:53  ocf: oh, so instead of .delegate('.header','hover') its .delegate('.header','mouseover',...)
08:54  ocf: yeah danheberden, I think I just landed it
08:54  dilvie: yep.
08:54  danheberden: don't forget about mouseenter and mouseleave
08:54  liquidcms: i would guess this is a quote issue.. more than a jq issue
08:55  danheberden: liquidcms: in your each, try function(i,v) { $(v)
08:55  liquidcms: nvm.. got it
08:55  dilvie: ocf: then you can set your mouseleave event to trigger the close when it leaves the header + content block area.
08:55  liquidcms: just used this $('' + this)
08:55  liquidcms: it doesnt like this directly.. but ok as long as i + it to something
08:56  dilvie: ocf: use this - http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
08:57  talented: liquidcms, can you paste your code?
08:57  liquidcms: umm.. but it is fixed now :)
08:57  talented: I want to see why you would do such a thing
08:57  dilvie: I'm going to sleep. I was only awake to push some bug fixes out.
08:57  dilvie: =)

08:57  liquidcms:       $('' + this).hide();
08:57  liquidcms:     });
08:57  liquidcms:   }
08:57  dilvie: later peeps
08:58  liquidcms: mypage is an array of strings
08:58  talented: is that a nested function :/
08:58  danheberden: liquidcms: paste please, don't paste multiline code
08:58  danheberden: sorry, use ?p
08:58  bot-t: sorry, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
08:58  liquidcms: lol.. ok.. didnt want to paste any code
08:58  liquidcms: night guys.. 3 AM here too.. thanks for the help
08:59  danheberden: jeez i'm old - 12pm and i feel so dead
08:59  talented: well, can see why his $(this) wasn't working
08:59  danheberden: *12am
08:59  talented: he could of done away with $('' + this) and just done this.
08:59  dilvie: yeah
09:00  danheberden: talented: 'this' was a string in an array
09:00  ocf: dilvie - mouseenter doesn't work at all
09:00  danheberden: which was #idOne, #idTwo that kinda thing
09:00  dilvie: ocf: oops
09:00  dilvie: ocf: I start talking out of my arse when I get sleepy.
09:00  ocf: well it should work, but i might be implementing it wrong

11:07  ruby_on_tails: http://pastebin.com/DxnCa9Qu whats wrong with this code ? i get checking is not definde
11:07  quicksilver: setTimeout(checking,300);
11:07  quicksilver: if you pass it a string, it has to eval it, and checking doesn't exist in the global scope.
11:07  ruby_on_tails: hmm
11:08  quicksilver: function ref is better than string anyway.
11:08  ruby_on_tails: ok, thanks
11:08  ruby_on_tails: got it
11:10  xotix: i dont get it.
11:10  ruby_on_tails: quicksilver: setTimeout(checking, 5); would call the checking function every 5 seconds right ?
11:11  jetienne: ruby_on_tails: setTimeout(checking, 5000) will do everty 5sec
11:11  ruby_on_tails: umm
11:12  ruby_on_tails: jetienne: but it does it onlye once

11:58  alaing: Cork I tried that exampel us sent me just now and it replaces the divs on the page.

11:58  alaing: is there a way i could cache the table and then work on it or somehow copy it

12:25  Crash_o: sorry, but I don't understand...
12:25  Crash_o: Google odn't support callback

12:31  Crash_o: SeriousJonny, "access denied"?
12:32  sean`: Crash_o, that is a JSON
12:32  sean`: not a JSONP
12:32  sean`: so y ou need to use a proxy to get that data
12:32  Crash_o: mmm
12:32  sean`: the reason I think they have this, is because you have a maps api for js
12:32  sean`: so, you can use that
12:32  Crash_o: unfortunatly
12:33  Crash_o: I can't use a proxy...
12:33  sean`: then use google maps api
12:33  sean`: i's greagt
12:33  SeriousJonny: what about parsing it
12:33  Crash_o: because this site is running on an AS400
12:33  sean`: SeriousJonny, you can't parse it if you can't get it
12:34  Crash_o: where I can't install php or something other
12:35  Crash_o: but If I can download it through the browser
12:35  SeriousJonny: what i dont understand is
12:35  SeriousJonny: you get valid json data back
12:35  SeriousJonny: so why cant you use it <.<
12:35  Crash_o: This is my initial questio
12:35  Crash_o: question
12:35  Crash_o: :-)
12:36  SeriousJonny: could it be
12:36  SeriousJonny: the linebreak
12:36  SeriousJonny: it mentions
12:36  Crash_o: sean`, I can get it... the response "invalid label" is about the first line in JSON
12:36  Crash_o: so I've GOT it
12:37  SeriousJonny: "status": "OK",\n
12:37  Crash_o: I think it is parsing as HTML or text....
12:37  Crash_o: so the \n char
12:37  Crash_o: is breaking balls
12:37  SeriousJonny: cause firebug can handle it
12:38  SeriousJonny: if you couldnt get any data firebug wouldnt show any
12:38  SeriousJonny: or jq wouldnt fire even an error
12:38  SeriousJonny: guess its the format the server delivers you
12:38  SeriousJonny: is bogus for jq
12:38  Gelegrod1n: the google repsonse is valid json
12:39  SeriousJonny: invalid label
12:39  SeriousJonny: [Break on this error] "status": "OK",\n

13:00  bot-t: JKarsrud, hoverIntent | jQuery Plugins - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover.

13:00  JKarsrud: If you want to pop shit up on hover, it's gonna be a pain

13:47  Woelfle: I can't even return the widget-instance in _init() to make something like this possible: $("#33").field().column
13:50  da-beginner: hi all
13:50  da-beginner: does anyone know resources to build google-like live-preview?
13:51  compaq: anyone use the jquery.corner.js plugin and know of a IE fix?
13:52  lithi: Hmm, I've come to the conclusion that there are multiple ways of inserting elements with text in another element, what would be a good approach?
13:53  compaq: lithi, what do you mean?
13:54  compaq: lithi, append() prepend()
13:54  lithi: hmm
13:54  lithi: yeah
13:54  lithi: I think thats what i'm looking for
13:55  lithi: yeah thats it
13:55  lithi: cheers
13:58  lithi: Also, is there a function to count elements inside an element?
14:00  teppi|work: lithi, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+length
14:01  ruby_on_tails: yo
14:02  lithi: mm'm
14:03  ruby_on_tails: mm'mm
14:04  lithi: Sweet, everythings going as planned :p
14:04  ruby_on_tails: its just destiny, no one plans anything
14:07  xotix: how do i make, if i hover over .second it should set its background to blue and the color of the a tag in it on white?
14:09  ruby_on_tails: xotix: $(".second").hover(function(){$(this).css("background", "bluehex");$(this).find("a").css("color", "#fff")}, function(){reverse})
14:10  lithi: Hmm
14:10  ruby_on_tails: lithi: hmm
14:11  lithi: I'm just wondering if i'll get .attr("value") form an input it will turn out right even if edited and reposted, but if i'll take a textareas .text(); value it will only show the original one even if it's edited
14:11  xotix: for whats the {reverse}?
14:11  lithi: from an input*
14:11  ruby_on_tails: xotix: to get back to original after you remove your mouse from the hover state
14:11  ruby_on_tails: you can skip that
14:11  xotix: rly? nice
14:12  xotix: okay thanks :)
14:12  ruby_on_tails: if you skip it your button will stay blue
14:12  ruby_on_tails: lithi: console.log the value
14:14  lithi: ?
14:14  lithi: What do you mean?
14:14  ruby_on_tails: nothing :P
14:15  lithi: :|
14:15  xotix: the reverse doesnt work. :( ^^
14:15  xotix: or isnt it just a foo thing?
14:15  ruby_on_tails: xotix: paste your code
14:16  ruby_on_tails: whats a foo thing ?
14:16  ruby_on_tails: ?.hover xotix
14:16  bot-t: ruby_on_tails, Couldn't find ".hover xotix" in jQuery Docs.
14:16  ruby_on_tails: ?xotix: .hover
14:16  bot-t: ruby_on_tails, Couldn't find "xotix: .hover" in jQuery Docs.
14:16  xotix:  place holder
14:16  ruby_on_tails: paste your code on pastebin.com
14:17  lithi: Ah got it
14:17  lithi: changed .text(); to .val();
14:17  xotix: it the oen you posted i thougth reverse does reset the element byitself, but i hae to write the func by myself, right?
14:17  lithi: which makes sense
14:17  ruby_on_tails: lithi: yes
14:17  ruby_on_tails: i never use .text()
14:18  ruby_on_tails: .val for inputs, .html() for tags
14:19  xotix: got it thanks a lot!
14:25  xotix: thanks!
14:25  nasso: i have loaded a page inside a jquery ui dialog windows with jquerys load-function. the page has a form and when i press any on the buttons on the form i want to close the dialog window
14:25  nasso: does anyone know how to do this?
14:25  nasso: i have managed to get it working with: $('button[role=button]').click();
14:26  nasso: but that just feels like an ugly hack :p
14:26  nasso: i have defined a jquery dialog button that closes the window
14:31  diago: nasso: you want the form to submit and then close the dialog?
14:32  nasso: diago, exactly
14:33  Birliban: how to trigger an change event via jquery? i have a dropdown and want to select an option via jquery, on selecting this, the change event must be triggered?
14:34  nasso: Birliban, something like: $('#selectid').change(function(){  alert("change"); }); ?
14:34  claudio: Birliban, have you tried simply setting the value of the select with .val() ? I think the change will then be fired
14:34  diago: nasso: that would need to go in the form event handler
14:35  nasso: Birliban, oh. the other way around. my bad. forget whet i just wrote
14:35  Birliban: nasso, this exists already ;-)
14:36  Birliban: claudio, i have an index with an id in any option, this is my refer. could i just use option selected?
14:36  nasso: diago, ok. but how do i close the dialog? i have a cancelbutton that closes the dialog and i can close it from the form by adding this to onclick:
14:36  nasso:  $('button[role=button]').click();
14:36  nasso: but there has to be an better way to do it?
14:37  diago: I would pass the dialog reference into the form handler and use the dialogs 'close' method
14:37  claudio: Birliban, with something like <option value='42'>Ehi</option> I'd try with $('select').val(42);
14:37  diago: handler($('some').dialog('widget'))
14:38  diago: or you could bind the context of the handler to the widget depending on your other needs
14:39  Birliban: claudio, then i get the jquery opject of the wanted option, but i need to select the option to fire change event
14:40  compaq: whats the best rounded corners with IE compatibility?
14:41  nasso: diago, ok. i think i have to do some reading about handlers. have never heard of it before
14:41  nasso: thanks though! :)
14:42 --- sveimac_ is now known as sveimac
14:42  diago: nasso: it's the function you are attaching to the onSubmit event
14:43  nasso: diago, oh. ok
14:45  claudio: Birliban, this works for me: http://paste2.org/p/1107131
14:45  claudio: (simply setting the val() seems not to fire the change event.)
14:46  lithi: Hmm, weird. My ajax request is taking 1.5seconds to complete, even though it's only parameter is success:
14:46  lithi: o_o
14:46  lithi: or, it might've been a lagspike of mine :0
14:47  lithi: and for some reason it's telling me that $.ajaxSend(); is not a function
14:47  lithi: o_o
14:47  lithi: $.ajaxSend is not a function my myfile.js(line #)
14:47  nasso: diago, i got a solution :) i declare the dialog in code. dialog = $('<div style="display:hidden"></div>').appendTo('body');
14:48  nasso: it was a local variable before but i made it global so i could access it from the form
14:48  nasso: and then i just did dialog.dialog("close"); from the onClick event of the button
14:48  nasso: diago, thanks for helping me!
14:50  Birliban: claudio, thanks for that
14:51  toxz: hi! is there a jquery alternative for array.indexOf(element) ??
14:52  diago: np nasso, glad you got it
14:52  lithi: toxz: most likely is, check the docs
14:52  toxz: i found jQuery.inArray()
14:55  claudio: do you know if there's a way to "kill" an .animate()? I mean, the setTimeout used by it
15:00  claudio: (A: nope) :(
15:02 --- rolux_ is now known as rolux
15:02  lithi: Mmm, can I put functions to be fired off after the previous one is done?
15:02  prgmrBill: put it one line beneath the current line
15:03  lithi: I have it like that now but they fire at the same time
15:03  prgmrBill: can you prove that?
15:06  daxroc: Afternoon all
15:07  lithi: prgmrBill: I can see it with my eyes :P
15:07  prgmrBill: lithi: the point I'm trying to make is that I think your analysis of the problem is erroneous
15:08  daxroc: When using the ajax request with dataType script can you access the parent html dom from the newly loaded scirpt ?
15:08  lithi: prgmrBill: explain :o
15:09  lithi: actually you might be right, now that I thin of it
15:09  lithi: thihnk
15:09  lithi: *
15:09  prgmrBill: lithi: to ensure something is running after another thing, set a variable and only execute the next part once that variable is set
15:09  lithi: yea
15:09  lithi: Well maybe I just got this in a wrong order
15:10  compaq: my website looks cheap
15:10  serio: compaq, presario's were cheap back in the day, seems fitting D:
15:11  prgmrBill: does e.preventDefault work for forms or should I use return false?
15:11  daxroc: hah,
15:11  gizmore: is it possible to have a single <input> and do something when enter is pressed?
15:11  freedgy: prgmrBill: yep it does
15:11  gizmore: *<input type="text">
15:11  daxroc: gizmore: yes
15:11  shifteleven: gizmore: sure
15:11  compaq: maybe some rounded corners and shadows will make it look better?
15:11  prgmrBill: freedgy: thanks!
15:11  lithi: gizmore: it's possible to onyl have the submit button :P
15:12  gizmore: i mean only the text input :]
15:12  lithi: oh right
15:12  lithi: my bad ^^
15:12  compaq: I am just gonna use thick border everywhere
15:13 * daxroc alerts teh border control !
15:14  lithi: aaah figured it out
15:14  lithi: Had to literally put some speed to things :P
15:14  gizmore: hmm i think i can just make the submit invisible =)

15:22  DrBitch: hello
15:22  DrBitch: i have this simple code: http://www.pastie.org/1322919
15:22  DrBitch: but when bubble is showing there is no text
15:22  DrBitch: but alt attributes are defined
15:23  RTPMatt: DrBitch: you are passing $ as the argument to your function this means you are overwriting jQuery with your event
15:23  RTPMatt: change function($) to function(e)
15:23  lithi: Hmm
15:23  lithi: What would make ajax request make non-success?
15:23  lithi: do I have to return false from the target or what?
15:24  DrBitch: RTPMatt: still getting blank
15:25  DrBitch: the problem is with $(this).attr('alt')
15:25  DrBitch: its returning blank
15:25  RTPMatt: DrBitch: please try posting what you are doing to jsfiddle.net I can't see what is happening otherwise
15:25  RTPMatt: $(this).attr('alt') is blank?
15:26  DrBitch: it isnt returning anything
15:26  DrBitch: but alt atributtes are defined
15:26  RTPMatt: lithi: if it is a link, or form or something else that would reload the page, you must return false, or call event.stopPropagation()
15:27  RTPMatt: DrBitch: at the top of your $(doc).ready function, do console.log(this); and see what you get back
15:28  triso-x: any one lost his ID ? http://img56.imageshack.us/img56/3066/88362309.png
15:28  DrBitch: RTPMatt: it doesnt returning nothing in console: just: 'window frontend_dev.php'
15:28  nasso: im trying to apply an function to an event of an element in a dialog that i loaded with jquerys load.
15:29  nasso: where should i put this? $(document).ready(function() { it too early!
15:29  RTPMatt: DrBitch: That is not correct for a well made jquery plugin
15:30  RTPMatt: change this to e.target
15:30  nasso: gah. there is a complate function i load. im stupid. forget that question :)
15:30  gizmore: how to get the value from <input type="text" id="foo"> ?
15:31  DrBitch: RTPMatt: ok not it returned 'function()'
15:31  RTPMatt: gizmore: $('#foo').val()
15:31  DrBitch: this is the code if somebody want to see... http://www.pastie.org/1322919
15:31  gizmore: RTPMatt: thank you... saved minutes of browsing :)
15:31  RTPMatt: sure thing
15:31  ajpiano: DrBitch, you are assuming that there is a scope change when there isn't
15:32  ajpiano: just because you're calling plugin, doesn't mean that 'this' changes to each element in context
15:32  RTPMatt: DrBitch: you better have gotten rid of that $ in tunction($) ;)
15:32  ajpiano: RTPMatt, you know there's nothing wrong with that, right
15:32  ajpiano: the problem is that he needs an 'each' essentialy
15:32  RTPMatt: is there not?
15:32  ajpiano: RTPMatt: there is not.
15:32  RTPMatt: well, poop me
15:32  RTPMatt: my bad, ignore me them
15:32  RTPMatt: then
15:33  DrBitch: <ajpiano can u put a piece of code
15:33  DrBitch: i dont know a lot of scopes
15:33  DrBitch: how can i create a scope with a this plugin
15:34  ajpiano: http://www.pastie.org/1322946
15:34  RTPMatt: passing in $ will not locally overwrite the assignment of $ to the vent rather than jquery?
15:34 * RTPMatt has some experimenting to do
15:34  ajpiano: RTPMatt, jQuery is passed as the argument to the document ready event, not an event object
15:35  RTPMatt: oh, duh, for whatever reason i was thinking i was looking at an event here
15:35  buddyq: hey guys, I'm trying to figure something out but I can't seem to filter or select the right thing. I've got a 4 level nested <ol>. I want to only select the second level <li>'s. How can I do that?
15:35  ajpiano: RTPMatt: the problem he was making was this... $("div").html($(this).html() + "foo")
15:35  RTPMatt: my bad, maybe I need some coffee
15:37  DrBitch: ajpiano: thanks very much
15:37  DrBitch: ill read something about scopes
15:37  DrBitch: now it works

15:48  buddyq: I have something like... ol li ol li ol li ol. I just want to select the second LEVEL of <ol>'s.
15:48  Madmartigan: ol > ol:first
15:48  buddyq: not the second one but the second level
15:48  Madmartigan: or..  ol ol:first

15:50  buddyq: Madmartigan, doesn't work. I tried that of course...
15:50  buddyq: anyone know how?
15:52  lithi: Madmartigan: o o:first;

15:52  lithi: ol ol
15:52  lithi: *
15:52  lithi: but then again
15:52  Madmartigan: he wants to get ALL the ols though, 2nd lvl
15:52  RTPMatt: can you post your actual markup?
15:52  lithi: Oh
15:52  lithi: ol > ol I think then :P
15:53  lithi: ol > ol > ol > ..... as much as he needs
15:53  Madmartigan: so i dont see why ol > li >ol dopesnt work
15:53  lithi: hmm
15:53  Brodingo: holler
15:53  lithi: try $("ol").child() or .find()
15:54  lithi: Mmm
15:54  lithi: how could I get two variables to be returned with ajax request?
15:54  Pawka: lithi, use JSON.
15:56  Madmartigan: lithi: returned from the server request?
15:56  gizmore: lithi: i agree with "use JSON"
15:56  buddyq: http://jsfiddle.net/JdSbf/5/
15:57  lithi: Meh, I just got the hang of ajax and now I have to change again
15:57  gizmore: lithi: basically you retrieve a json string via ajax
15:58  gizmore: lithi: php?
15:58  RTPMatt: there is no ol that is a direct child of another ol

16:01  Defi__: hi everyone, i am trying to position a dialog box, whenever i do $("#dialog").dialog("option", "position", [x, y]) it sets the y position but it always stays against the left side of the document, ignoring x
16:01  Defi__: does anyone have any idea why or of a workaround?
16:01  StevenTyler: how do you get all the indices of 'man' from 'footballmanagerman'?
16:03  lithi: gizmore: yeah php
16:03  lithi: I just basically got the idea of how ajax works
16:03  Defi__: even with $("#dialog").dialog({ autoOpen: true, position: 'center' }); it still sticks to the left side
16:03  lithi: can you get the response to return as an array or something?
16:04  RTPMatt: Defi__: are you using the latest stable jquery and jqueryUI?
16:04  Pawka: lithi, you can use php funcion json_encode to serialize arrays and other data to JSON object.
16:04  Defi__: RTPMatt: yup, directly from google
16:05  Pawka: lithi, then make ajax query with jQuery.getJSON()
16:05  Pawka: or parse response with .parseJSON
16:05  Madmartigan: lithi: php way to check if the request is ajax http://pastebin.com/bSPc7qAJ
16:06  RTPMatt: Defi__: it sounds like your code it right, can you reduce it down to just the dialog, and if still having problems post it to jsfiddle or something?
16:06  lithi: mm
16:07  Defi__: RTPMatt: if i resize it with the mouse and then hide it or create it again, i can position it correctly

16:30  Defi__: RTPMatt: just tested it in a seperate file without layout, and it works
16:31  Defi__: must be a css conflict of some kind, will have to figure out what exactly
16:32  RTPMatt: Defi__: ok, good luck
16:36  r0x4n4: dukebag,
16:37  dukebag: repeat your questions here
16:37  r0x4n4: oki
16:37  r0x4n4: Hi, I create jquery menu, when yo click in a button  this change color, but the problem is... that doesn't function, I mean doesn't redirect to the page, I tried with a window.location in jquery but, when do it the redirect, the button rest and noone is "active", it's posible just to load the content with jquery ?
16:37  r0x4n4: like a tab or something like this
16:38  dukebag: ok, the answer you'll always get is that you should not ever use javascript to perform a function that HTML does natively
16:38 --- frigginSmoke is now known as seutje
16:38  dukebag: i'm not going to go into it, search the keyword "accessibility, javascript"
16:38  dukebag: beyond that, you should paste your code so ppl can look at it and give you specifics with what's wrong
16:38  RTPMatt: r0x4n4: not sure exactly what you are doing, but you could try $(whereToPlaceIt).load(URLtoLead)
16:39  r0x4n4: ...
16:39  gooddesignusa: r0x4n4: you can use .load to load some content via ajax
16:40  r0x4n4: ey look http://mt.marcoconsultora.com/ try with menu doesn't redirect
16:40 --- illusionz is now known as impreziv
16:41  r0x4n4: let me try with load
16:41  Brodingo: my eyes
16:41  N00b333: In jquery tabs, is there any successful way to use "hash anchors" within the tabs (which already use hash anchors) ?
16:42  sveajobb: Hi, I'm haveing some trouble with serialize.  var rootElemeent = $('blaj blaj');  var o = rootElement.find('input').serialize(); I can't seem to get anything nice into o. for(v in o) alert(v + '=' + o[v]); returns bogus.
16:43  sveajobb: What could possibly be wrong? I've got serialize working before.. can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong this time
16:43  erichynds: serialize returns a string
16:44  sveajobb: ... really? well I guess I have to try alert then :)
16:45  sveajobb: ok, so the error is that it returns an empty string
16:45  sveajobb: which is really weird. do I have to set ID doesn't name suffice?
16:45  ||cw: sveajobb: maybe the $('blaj blaj') isn't matching?
16:46  ||cw: the whole point of serialize is that it returns a string, btw
16:46  sveajobb: ||cw, I thought of that aswell so I did a  .css({background:'yellow'}) on them and they turned yellow :)
16:46  ||cw: and rootElement.find('input').css({background:'yellow'}) too?
16:46  sveajobb: ||cw, I would have prefered an object so I could pass it to $.extend and use it in $.ajax
16:47  ||cw: find() will return an object
16:47  sveajobb: ||cw, yes, on the input elements
16:48  sveajobb: .... omfg
16:48  sveajobb: Ok, I am officially retarded. I see the error now
16:48  nail_: if I want to include a script/css for IE7+ and all other browsers, the invalid <![if gt IE 6 ]> markup is the way to go, right?
16:49  sveajobb: for some reason when I changed id into name I spelled name like this c l a s s
16:51  sveajobb: Well ok then. to my next question then. Is there a smart way of concatenating a string returned from serialize along with some custom data stored in an object (lists and stuff like that) ?
16:51  elb0w: theres no .value() method is there? is it .attr("value")?
16:52  sveajobb: el_kevino,  .val()
16:52  RTPMatt: sveajobb: like you want to concat the entire object on to it, or just some of it?
16:52  sveajobb: elb0w, .val()
16:52  sveajobb: sorry, wrong person :)
16:52  elb0w: ty
16:52  sveajobb: RTPMatt, yeah the entire object
16:53  r0x4n4: forget it, it's alive \o/ ... It's was cache...
16:54  StevenTyler: any idea why it's showing undefined for http://pastie.org/1323141 ?
16:54 --- jxpx777__ is now known as jxpx777
16:54  erichynds: the != null isn't necessary
16:54  RTPMatt: sveajobb: you could $.each over the object and add them that way?
16:54  RTPMatt: that is the best idea i have
16:54  StevenTyler: but that doesn't explain the undefined output
16:55  sveajobb: RTPMatt, is there perhaps a way to deserialize the serialized string? and then do $.extend?
16:55  lithi: And my shoutbox is done :p
16:55  sveajobb: RTPMatt, or well.. I guess I could do an own extend which returns an object instead of a string.. I guess that would be easiest
16:55  lithi: http://thegame.banreality.net/
16:55  StevenTyler: also, it goes into an infinite loop if I don't don != null
16:56  RTPMatt: sveajobb: I don't think so, you could extend then deserialize it by hand
16:56  erichynds: it won't work with the != null
16:57  jcody: hey channel, having serious issues with ie 6-8 choking on fading elements with transparent background images. thinking of writing a plugin to override fading behavior so fadeIn and fadeOut become .show and .hide in IE. anyone have thoughts on this? bad idea?
16:57  erichynds: http://gyazo.com/fd0d8b5378d731ef5f55c2d6a0d61c85.png
16:57  StevenTyler: wow!
16:57  StevenTyler: that fixed it, gaaah!
16:58  StevenTyler: thanks erichynds
16:58  erichynds: yep
16:58  ultrarapid: hi, i want to create the effect of something scrolling by using slideUp() then changing the content and then slideUp() again, but can't get it to work. I haveto use slideUp() then slideDown() otherwise the new content doesn't show
16:58  StevenTyler: god bless you with excellent and profitable projects

17:05  sveajobb: Aah, that did the trick :)  jQuery.fn.objSerialize
17:05  RTPMatt: nice
17:05  Carneque: Hey all, I'm using JCarosel http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/ in a project and it only shows the first and last image in the list.    http://jsfiddle.net/Jzt6C/
17:05  Carneque: Any ideas?
17:06  Brodingo: moo
17:06  Brodingo: tools
17:06  Carneque: wrap: 'circular' is the only one that works
17:06  Carneque: moo tools?
17:06  Carneque: Never tried that before
17:06  Brodingo: youre loading mootools in that fiddle
17:07  Carneque: where?
17:08  RTPMatt: Carneque: on the left side where it says "choose framework"
17:09  Brodingo: also, if youre not really using the carousel functionality why not use cycle instead?
17:09  RTPMatt: Carneque: it would be nice if you could stick in a url to the actual lib too, so we can actually test it
17:09  `Peter`: can anyone give me a hand with the .parents() function?
17:09  `Peter`: it doesn't seem to return what I expect
17:10  RTPMatt: `Peter`: what are you expecting?
17:10  `Peter`: RTPMatt : I run .parents() on each p element in my html
17:10  `Peter`: but it always returns HTML and BODY as the tag names
17:10  `Peter`: when some of the p elements are nested
17:10  `Peter`: it never returns anything but html and body
17:11  `Peter`: so for the nested elements I'm expecting HTML, BODY, P
17:11  `Peter`: but it doesn't do that
17:12  rupert88: hey guys... how would i fix an element to the top of the screen to stop it going completely off the screen with jquery?
17:12  Carneque: let me check this
17:12  erichynds: position:fixed ?
17:12  rupert88: no, it cant be fixed initially
17:13  rupert88: i want it to behave normally, until you try to scroll it off the screen
17:13  Carneque: Hey guys I'm gonna throw everything up on my server (eeww) haha one second
17:14  `Peter`: RTPMatt : It seems to work if I nest spans for example, but not p
17:14  `Peter`: and p is what I really need lol
17:14  RTPMatt: `Peter`: that seems odd, can you post an example over to jsfiddle?
17:15  `Peter`: uh sure let me work out how to do this
17:15  claudio: `Peter`, <p>s can't nest. Maybe your browser "normalizes" the DOM
17:15  Brodingo: rupert88 http://jqueryfordesigners.com/iphone-like-sliding-headers/ helpful?
17:16  RTPMatt: claudio: good catch
17:16  rupert88: it could be actually yeah,cheers
17:16  claudio:  <!ELEMENT P - O (%inline;)*
17:16  `Peter`: damn
17:17  `Peter`: that's not very helpful lol
17:17  `Peter`: since that's exactly what I need
17:17  `Peter`: no wonder I couldn't work out the element depth properly
17:18  dilvie: I'm trying to get image width and height right after $mainImage.attr('src', imageName); -- but it's giving me unpredictable results. Sometimes it's the correct value - sometimes it's a smaller value. I suspect it's trying to get the value before the image has finished loading. Is there an event I can listen to so I can fire a callback when the image has loaded?
17:18  Carneque: Here you go guys!  Thanks for your help on this carousel
17:18  Carneque: http://www.adamhott.nl/tik/index2.html
17:19  claudio: dilvie, attach a "load" handler to the image element
17:19  dilvie: claudio: Thanks a million.
17:19  claudio: dilvie, IMGs fires load events
17:19  dilvie: Very cool.
17:20  dilvie: =)
17:20  claudio: :)
17:20  dilvie: Thanks for the tip.
17:20  `Peter`: claudio : if I put a span within the p and list the parents of that, I get nested p elements
17:20  `Peter`: so that's rather annoying
17:20  claudio: `Peter`, invalid HTML, unreliable results :)
17:21 * `Peter` switches to DIVs
17:24  NiftyLettuce: any advice on jQTouch and Box2D working simultaneously?
17:24  NiftyLettuce: or box2d experts here that want a job lol

17:28  lithi: I managed with a load of struggle to get my shoutbox working :P
17:29  Lumpio-: "It's not supposed to accept foreign characters :p"
17:29  Lumpio-: Define "foreign"
17:30  lithi: well
17:30  lithi: foreign might be a little wrongly stated
17:30  lithi: but such as Ã¥Ã¶Ã¤
17:30  azeaeazea: qsdqsd
17:30  Lumpio-: lithi: Why would you not accept all characters?
17:30  lithi: aweawe?
17:31  ||cw: lithi: can't you just use unicode?
17:31  ||cw: has to go through the whole stack though
17:32  lithi: Lumpio-: Cause I dont know how to do proper database protection
17:32  Lumpio-: ...
17:32  ||cw: just set your table and connection to utf8
17:32  Lumpio-: You're not protecting your thing properly as it is you know
17:32  lithi: Yeah like I said
17:32  Lumpio-: If I was mean I'd XSS it

17:41  IM_: hi everybody, I'm using jQuery+MSXML.DOMDocument in a Microsoft HTA app to read a XML config file; I've successfully loaded it but now I want to persist the structure and don't know how to get the XML source from jQuery object to store data, could somebody give me some hints on how to do that?
17:41  crab: and, just like that, i am enlightened.
17:42  swiggy: how do you copy something to the clipboard? I have a textbox that when the user clicks in it, i want it to select all the text and then copy it to their clipboard automatically (similar to what imageshack does with their links to share)
17:42  lithi: Lumpio-: I figured filter_input might be a solution to atleast some of the XSS
17:43  timing: swiggy: that;s evil!
17:43  swiggy: ?
17:43  serio: it's evil, but it can be done.
17:43  timing: well, what if I have something important in my clipboard
17:43  timing: and I go to your site and you overwrite my important data
17:44  Lumpio-: lithi: Filtering HTML out is useless
17:44  Lumpio-: Just escape it.
17:44  lithi: I'm escaping it
17:44  swiggy: serio, where do i search for it?
17:44  lithi: mysql_query("INSERT INTO game_tempcomments (name,date,comment) VALUES('".mysql_real_escape_string($name)."','$date','".mysql_real_escape_string($comment)."');");
17:44  serio: on the internet
17:44  timing: swiggy: I see some hacks with flash
17:44  serio: ?g how to copy to clipboad in javascript @ swiggy

17:45  serio: I beat you
17:45  timing: serio: we are teh googlers :-)
17:45  timing: yeah you did
17:45  whutch:  just select all the text for them, let them choose to ctrl+c
17:45  timing: I agree with whutch
17:45  swiggy: that is so sloppy..
17:46  swiggy: there has got to be a straght forward javascript way
17:46 --- gnat_x_ is now known as gnat_x
17:46  gizmore: swiggy: important is to not interrupt common user behaviour
17:47  swiggy: yeah i know
17:47  timing: and you have to tell the user 'the data is in your clipboard'
17:47  timing: I think 90% of the people hit ctrl+c themself too
17:47  Jonz: skitch has a really good way of doing this
17:47  timing: because they don't believe you actually put it there
17:47  Jonz: they select the text in an input box, then there's a little button that says "copy to clipboard"
17:47  Jonz: so its a one-click action, but it also is clear to the user what is happening
17:47  gizmore: Jonz: that sounds good
17:48  timing: hmm, good one

17:52  Carneque: I shall
17:53  lithi: properly equals?
17:53  lithi: I dont really know many ways of escaping the strings
17:53  johnathanb: By doing it properly?
17:56  Lumpio-: Just escape the special HTML characters

18:23  inoni: whats the jquery function for getting your script to load without waiting for the whole page to load 1st
18:26  Aamir: ?ready @inoni
18:26  bot-t: inoni, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
18:26  ||cw: inoni: um, that's the default behavior when the code is in the HEAD section
18:26  ||cw: ready() waits for the whole page to laod first
18:26  inoni: no not ready
18:27  Aamir: loadscript?
18:27  Brodingo: ready() waits for the dom to be ready
18:27  inoni: so whats the code for load before page is loaded?
18:27  Brodingo: $('window').load() wait for every element to be loaded
18:27  gnarf: inoni: just execute the JS wherever you want to
18:28  Brodingo: um, how about no wrapping it in a fucntioN?
18:28  gnarf: i.e. <script> tag at the bottom
18:28  inoni: its not in a function
18:28  inoni: its in a external file
18:28  gnarf: doesn't need the $(function() { }); wrapper
18:28  Carneque: Later guys, thanks for the tip on cycle
18:28  gnarf: inoni: what is the purpose of the code?
18:29  inoni: to make it load before the page finish loading
18:29  gnarf: make wht load?
18:29  inoni: my script
18:29  gnarf: you're not helping
18:29  Brodingo: oh my god
18:29  gnarf: :)
18:30  Aamir: why you want to load something before loading the page ? :/
18:30  gnarf: a <script> tag loads the JS >IMMEDIATELY<
18:30  gnarf: in fact, it even waits for the JS to finish loading before proceeding with the rest of the page
18:30  gnarf: so, if there is a specific task you want to perform at a specific time, inject the <script>
18:30  Aamir: include ur js file in head
18:31  inoni: it is....
18:31  inoni: ill paste my code in a moment
18:31  Brodingo: can you paste it 10 minutes ago?
18:31  inoni: no because i cant go back in time
18:31  Brodingo: oh, darn
18:32  gnarf: inoni: $(document).ready(somefunction) will run somefunction whenever the DOM has finished loading, and all your HTML elements will be available
18:32  gnarf: if you just call somefunction() it is run immediately
18:32  inoni: http://pastebin.com/ijHJGDX3
18:33  gnarf: ow, my eyes
18:33  gnarf: :)
18:33  inoni: its messy at the top
18:33  inoni: had to trick css =)
18:33  Brodingo: oh my
18:33  gnarf: so, both of those big ass blocks of code are running on document ready
18:33  gnarf: and probably need to
18:34  gnarf: specially the "roundthis"
18:34  gnarf: or whatever that is
18:34  inoni: yup thats why i need to know whats the correct function to load them before the page loads
18:34  gnarf: you can't affect DOM elements that aren't loaded
18:35 --- seutje is now known as frigginWOrk
18:35 --- frigginWOrk is now known as frigginWork
18:35  gnarf: remove the document.ready() calls, and include the script AFTER the content you wish to alter
18:36  inoni: cant remove document.ready
18:36  gnarf: $j(somefunc) is an alias for $j(document).ready(somefunc)
18:36  inoni: my script stops working correctly
18:36  gnarf: remove the document.ready calls and include the script AFTER the content you wish to alter (not in the <head>
18:37  gnarf: thats the only way to execute something any sooner than .ready()
18:37  inoni: ok lemme try
18:37  gnarf: think like google analytics script, include at the bottom before </body>
18:38  gnarf: at that point, all your DOM elements have been created
18:39  inoni: ahh it worked
18:40  inoni: thanks
18:40  gnarf: no problem, try listening next time? :)
18:40  inoni: yes i will =)
18:40  letsgojuno: anyone got a min, I'm trying to get the absolute pos of an image in a page, .position doesn't work btw... http://jsbin.com/ifodo3/2/edit
18:42  gnarf: letsgojuno: see ?.offset() ?
18:42  bot-t: letsgojuno, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
18:42  gnarf: .position() returns position to its nearest relative parent
18:42  gnarf: .offset() goes all the way to the doc
18:43  letsgojuno: ill give it a go but think i tried it before.
18:43  letsgojuno: its a bookmarklet im building
18:43  gnarf: letsgojuno: is the image hidden? you can't call .offset() on a hidden element either
18:43  letsgojuno: so the images are in different viewers for zooming etc
18:43  gnarf: or rather, it wont be correct
