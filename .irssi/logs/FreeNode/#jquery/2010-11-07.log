20:59 @ajpiano: you can pick up your uniform from the table over there
21:00 @ajpiano: Aliv3, other people have solved this problem already

21:01  snover: KB1JWQ: pm for cyber?
21:01  Aliv3: but i dont want to use php
21:01 @ajpiano: what does php have to do with it
21:04  OhaiBBQ: lol
21:04  snover: ajpiano: I thought you had to PHP in order to jQuery
21:04  snover: ajpiano: Actually I am pretty sure you do because I read it on a disqus comment by happylover75
21:04 @ajpiano: snover: it's true
21:04 @ajpiano: you have to be a Pretty Happenin' Person
21:04 @ajpiano: to use jQuery
21:04  OhaiBBQ: isnt jQuery BBQ written in php?
21:05  skonet: snover: I guess thats what I was looking for!  now figuring out the difference between those two :P time to read the documentation for both
21:05  Aliv3: ok this is what i was looking for http://w3schools.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=16302&st=0&p=88781&#entry88781
21:05  snover: skonet: The difference is live binds to the document whereas delegate can bind a lower element
21:06  snover: Aliv3: If it has the word “w3schools” in it, I can pretty much guarantee it is not what you want
21:06  dilvie: snover: you're not kidding.
21:06  Aliv3: its a post
21:06  OhaiBBQ: w3schools
21:06  Aliv3: i know i know w3schools == fail generally
21:06  Aliv3: but theirs a post on it
21:07  uvacav: is there anyway to set a delegate or live with elements in dynamically added iframes before the iframe is loaded
21:07  snover: Aliv3: I think you really, really want to reconsider just using BBQ.
21:07  OhaiBBQ: hate it when people talk about bbq ;[
21:07  snover: ?ohai @ OhaiBBQ
21:07  bot-t: OhaiBBQ, bbq bbq bbq bbq bbq bbq
21:07  skonet: snover: thanks, you're awesome, I think its doing what I want now...
21:08  dilvie: uvacav: That kindof the point of delegate and live. Both of them work in the context you described.
21:08  dilvie: I mean, they also have other advantages, but one of them is the ability to set up your event handling before the elements are actually ready to manipulate.
21:09  Aliv3: does it use jquery
21:09  snover: Aliv3: it can, or it can not.
21:09  Aliv3: if i have page.html?post=example and in my code do alert($_GET['post']); will it give me a popup that says exampe
21:09  uvacav: dilvie: i thought I had to call .contents.find() to select an element inside an iframe? and I can't call iframe's contents() until the iframe is added
21:11  dilvie: uvacav: Oh, sorry. I'm the wrong guy to ask about iframes. I rarely use them.
21:11  snover: uvacav: that’s correct; .contents() gets you into the context of the inner frame
21:11  snover: Aliv3: So…you are wanting to just pull stuff from the query-string part?
21:12  OhaiBBQ: ?mdc location.search
21:12  bot-t: OhaiBBQ, window.location - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
21:13  uvacav: snover: right, so am I right in thinking that i cant use .delegate or .live to watch for events on elements in iframes unless I set the .delegate or .live AFTER the iframe itself has loaded?
21:13  snover: uvacav: Before you continue down this road, I need to warn you that you are going to leak memory like a motherfucker if you start attaching events to framed documents
21:15  snover: uvacav: cleanData doesn’t pay attention to what happens inside iframes and so your event listeners will never be automatically unbound or cleaned up when a frame navigation/reload/remove happens
21:16  uvacav: snover: uh-oh.. hm.. I'll have to look into that..dont have much of a choice in the iframes right now as Im using ckeditor which uses contentEditable='true' on an iframes body
21:16 @ajpiano: uvacav: why do you need to bind to events inside of an RTE
21:16  uvacav: collaboration
21:17 @ajpiano: you're trying to make etherpad

21:21  TSnowman: hi, does anyone know how I can change the color of specific items returned in an autocomplete set?
21:22 @ajpiano: TSnowman: you can use the _renderItem callback (not...really..documented) and add a class or whatever you want...
21:22  TSnowman: I have a custom source function that returns a data set, I also have a success function that I can use to remap the data as I please
21:22 @ajpiano: to the autocomplete menu entries
21:22  TSnowman: ajpiano: googling this callback :)
21:23  mathi: hi
21:23 @ajpiano: TSnowman it's in one of the jqueryui demos
21:23 @ajpiano: the one "custom data and display" jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete
21:23  TSnowman: I have that open, didn't even notice...
21:23  TSnowman: ooooh
21:24  mathi: I have several radio input elements with class "patientLang". I need to check the input which has a value of variable "language". how can I achieve this ?
21:24  KB1JWQ: snover: Not in front of the kids. :-p
21:25  mathi: for example, if variable "language" has a value of "fr", I need to check <input class="patientLang" type="radio" name="language" value="fr"> FR
21:26 @ajpiano: $("input.patientLang[value='"+ language +"']");
21:29  mathi: ajpiano, thank you
21:29  cardona507: I am trying to get the -moz-border-radius value for a div in my markup -when I use this code https://gist.github.com/666399 in my console I see (an empty string) - has anyone experienced this? Does anyone have any insight into how to get the -moz-radius-border value?
21:30  cardona507: it works fine when I say
21:32  cardona507: ok - I changed the gist slightly to show what code I have that works and what doesn't work
21:32  cardona507: I can successfully use jQuery to get the border-radius value from chrome but not the -moz-border-radius value from firefox
21:33  melvinram: Hi there, I'm looking for a little help with figuring out what to google for what I need. I've got this page I'm working on: http://www.photoblog.com.php5-16.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com and when someone clicks the Login link at the top, I want it to show the login form. I've got that working. Now I need to figure out how to make it hide automatically if the user moves the mouse out of that area and doesn't have the focus on the field
21:33  melvinram: Any help would be appreciated.
21:34  melvinram: I want the timeout for that to be about 5 or 10 seconds
21:35  TSnowman: you can use bind() for mouseover and mouseout events and define custom functions to control the timers
21:35  TSnowman: the login form can be showen/hidden using show() and hide() (you can redefine the effect it uses to do that)
21:37  melvinram: TSnowman: any examples or tutorials you can think of that talks about that timers part?
21:38  loxs: how do I select a submit button in jquery?
21:39  melvinram: TSnowman: could I pay you to do it for me?
21:40  TSnowman: lol are you serious?
21:41  melvinram: Yes, I have a meeting coming up shortly and I don't want to waste time doing it.
21:41  melvinram: *Waste time figuring it out
21:42  unomi: melvinram: mouseexit
21:42  TSnowman: just one moment, phone call brb
21:42  unomi: mouseout, even
21:42 @ajpiano: melvinram, how much $
21:42  melvinram: unomi: well it's not just a mouseout on the link... but also on the login form
21:43  unomi: err, mouseleave
21:43  unomi: you can put the mouseleave on the container
21:43  melvinram: unomi: hmm let me try
21:43  unomi: http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
21:44  sean`: mousesleave
21:44  TSnowman: I think you need to increment a global variable with setInterval() every 1 sec
21:44  sean`: Who?
21:44 @ajpiano: please don't do that
21:44  unomi: he was talking ot melvinram
21:44  TSnowman: then mouseleave/out/whatever function you end up using simply resets that count
21:44  TSnowman: this is probably a bad way to go about it though in JS
21:45  TSnowman: sean`: yeah, sorry, melvinram
21:45  melvinram: unomi: thanks... got it working
21:45  unomi: no worries
21:45  melvinram: http://www.photoblog.com.php5-16.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/
21:45  melvinram: TSnowman: is that a bad way to do it?
21:45  unomi: as for the 5 second thing, just have a setTimout on mouseleave that you clear on mouseenter
21:46  TSnowman: what I just described will prolly work but something feels off about it in JS...single thread...timers...resetting...asking for trouble
21:46  TSnowman: I need to rethink :)
21:46 @ajpiano: melvinram how much $
21:46 @ajpiano: i could literalyl code this in 3 minutes
21:46 @ajpiano: if that
21:46  sean`: You'd be honoring your president too
21:46  TSnowman: lol
21:46 @ajpiano: at my standard rate of $9001/hr
21:47 @ajpiano: that should come in pretty cheap
21:47  cardona507: haha
21:47  TSnowman: iso 9001/hr
21:47  melvinram: lol
21:47  melvinram: ajpiano: I would have been up for paying $25 for it but since it's working, don't need it anymore
21:47  melvinram: sorry bud
21:48  TSnowman: melvinram: do the same thing you're doing now on that page but add a div or border with a little 'x' around it, on mouse enter, show...and have the little 'x' hide() it
21:48 @ajpiano: i thought you wanted a delay before the container disappeared?
21:48  zwalden: If I clone an element that has multiple input boxes within it, how can I change the name of these input boxes with an incrementing variable?
21:48  melvinram: ajpiano: it's not critical
21:48  sean`: zwalden, why not use the [] convention
21:49  TSnowman: melvinram: it's too late, you have to pay him; he'll break your legs if you don't
21:49  TSnowman: it's one of those irc-rules
21:49  melvinram: TSnowman: is there a reason? I mean I'm doing the same thing but putting the trigger on the parent
21:49  TSnowman: sorry, is there a reason for...?
21:49  melvinram: TSnowman: lol i see... well no one told me so
21:49  zwalden: Well, maybe i'm thinking all wrong, I am using the [] convention, but it's two levels deep, and I also need to be able to display the data again(if they want to make changes)
21:50 @ajpiano: melvinram http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/Uj4Bs/
21:50  zwalden: so I have something like supersedes[$i][0] - supersedes[$i][5]
21:50 @ajpiano: there it is, with no css, but iwth a delay
21:50  melvinram: TSnowman: for putting the trigger on the border/parent. I don't want it to have a border visually
21:50 @ajpiano: it was 4 lines of code, counting },5000);
21:50  TSnowman: nice
21:50  zwalden: so when I add another one, i need to find my place; if i were to just do [][], it throws them all in one array or maybe I did it wrong..
21:51  melvinram: ajpiano:
21:51  melvinram: that didn't work
21:51  melvinram: but that's okay
21:51  TSnowman: it works in jsfiddle on my end
21:51  TSnowman: disappears after 5secs
21:51  zwalden: I guess I could've split the array with php, every 6 values, but I figured I could do it with JQuery too
21:51 @ajpiano: yeah, works fine for me too
21:51  TSnowman: zwalden: I think you may want a for loop with splice()
21:52  dilvie: how do I get the value of a select option?
21:52 @ajpiano: ?val
21:52  bot-t: .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
21:53  melvinram: hmm
21:53  zwalden: ah thanks TSnowman, i'll try it out.
21:53  TSnowman: np
21:55  dilvie: ajpiano: I'm trying to use .val(), but unless I'm missing something (which isn't unusual), it's giving me the descriptive text instead of the value.
21:55 @ajpiano: which version of jquery
21:55 @ajpiano: i do recall it trying to be a little too clever w/ select options
21:57  TSnowman: dilvie: I use var options = $('#selectid').find('option'); options.index(options.filter(":selected"))
21:58  TSnowman: probably not the most efficient if you have a lot of items in the pull down
21:58 @ajpiano: TSnowman: you know you could just do $("#select option:selected")
21:59  TSnowman: ajpiano: yeah, I've seen that before it's just that I so often use "options" var that I have to do it like above...and forget all about the syntax you just showed :)
22:00 @ajpiano: ok
22:00  TSnowman: my jquery-judo is not strong yet :D
22:00 @ajpiano: TSnowman: in any event, dilvie's problem isn't that he doesn't know how to find the selected option
22:00  TSnowman: oh
22:00 @ajpiano: it's that .val() on an option is returning the inner text of the option, instead of the value
22:00  TSnowman: I totally misunderstood his question then
22:01  sean`: It's sad to be misunderstood
22:01  disappearedng: http://imagebin.org/122242 for something like this do I use span for e1 and wrapper of e2 and e3?
22:01  TSnowman: it's sad to be misunderstanding
22:01  TSnowman: or to construct grammatically-poor sentences like that--^
22:01  TSnowman: hehe
22:02  TSnowman: (that arrow was supposed to point to my statement btw)

22:31 @ajpiano: nice!
22:32  teolicy: snover: Uhm... I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong about it, but I though the way GET encodes and POST encodes are different, no?

22:47  TSnowman: ajpiano: another q regarding autocomplete - how do I prevent the normal behaviour on focus and on select? specifically, how do I prevent item.label appearing in the text field (I realise I have to override the functions but what to put in them?)
22:48  TSnowman: like, I have select: funct(event, ui) { some stuff I want to do...<want to prevent item.label from appearing in text field/autocomplete field> ...}
22:48 @ajpiano: TSnowman: .autocomplete({focus:function(e,ui) { return false; });
22:48  TSnowman: hmm, I tried return false just now didn't seem to do anything :/
22:48 @ajpiano: prevents it happening wen you just hover
22:48 @ajpiano: in the focus event, not select
22:48  TSnowman: oh
22:49  TSnowman: ok...how about preventing on select behaviour?
22:50  TSnowman: like, once the user selects the item my function does what I want it to do but the item.value still ends up in the text field I used to start the autocomplete
22:51 @ajpiano: uhh, i think you need to cancel the default and then set this.value = watever
22:51 @ajpiano: i can't remmber, i kinda wanna get off the comp for a bit though
22:51  TSnowman: hehe ok, thanks for the quick info :)
