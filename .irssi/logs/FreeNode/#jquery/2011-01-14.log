09:32  Jester831: what's causing it to change?
09:32  AL13N_work: ajax event from other jquery stuff
09:33  Jester831: well, if you're changing it, then you shouldn't use a user event
09:33  AL13N_work: Jester831: well it's code from someone else
09:33  AL13N_work: Jester831: i would like to not change that code
09:33  Jester831: I'd need to see the code to help
09:33  AL13N_work: Jester831: modular stuff and all that
09:34  AL13N_work: in effect, the ajax success event does stuff which does $("#id").html(result);
09:34  AL13N_work: so possibly if i can add another event but i need to be 100% it's executed after the first event is completely done
09:35  Jester831: well, you can double bind the same event
09:35  Jester831: but no setting hte html doesn't trigger an event, although you can trigger an event yourself

10:46  kaseano: hey, I'd like to do something where each letter in the title fades-in in sequence, is there a way to get each letter in a sequence?
10:46  Hex_101: that's just confusing me lol
10:46  kaseano: So i don't have to put each letter in a span with an id
10:47  bloopletech: mastro: there's no mycontainer element in the html sample
10:47  bloopletech: what selector are you actually using?
10:47  mastro: bloopletech, that was an example
10:47  clarkfischer: kaseano: Lettering.js?
10:47  mastro: bloopletech, this is the actual selector i'm using: #sitemap_container li > ul
10:47  kaseano: I'll look that up, thanks clarkfischer
10:47  ocf: kaseano - i've used the typewriter plugin, not sure about fading each in
10:47  clarkfischer: http://letteringjs.com/
10:48  kaseano: mayb i can dig through the typewriter and figure out how they did
10:48  mastro: trisox, children only go down 1 level...
10:49  ocf: mastro - unless you have a sub basement
10:49  mastro: may be find? i tried jQuery('#sitemap_container').find('li > ul') but it seems it do now work as well
10:49  ocf: what are you trying to do here?
10:49  bloopletech: what are you guys talking about? the #sitemap_container ul part is a descendent selector so it does that part first, then the child selector
10:50  trisox: Use it 2 times
10:50  jomofcw: http://letteringjs.com/ > clarkfischer it seems it isn't crossbrowser :/...
10:50  kaseano: oh that's awesome lettering puts the span/id on for you
10:50  mastro: bloopletech, ocf uh.. sorry... my bad.. i was using an each function with an if.. the if is wrong and that's why it doesn't do anything
10:51  bloopletech: http://jsfiddle.net/FmyBn/ proves it works
10:51  mastro: anyway... I've have a markup like the one i gave to you, i'm not the one rendering it.. is there some javascript I can apply to make it a tree with open / close feature and collapseAll / expandAll button?
10:51  bloopletech: trisox: ocf: the space between sitemap_container and the ul means it's a descendent selector, not a child selector
10:51  mastro: may be some plugin already out there
10:52  mastro: bloopletech, yes that was the idea
10:52  bloopletech: mastro: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+tree+plugin
10:52  mastro: bloopletech, already googled....
10:53  mastro: bloopletech, I want to have a suggestion on which one to use
10:53  deebo: was there a selector to skip first match?
10:53  mastro: deebo, yes to skip the root ul
10:53  deebo: like $('#something > allbutfirstchildren').remove()
10:53  mastro: deebo, more like "hide" but yes
10:54  bloopletech: mastro: :not(first-child) maybe
10:54  bloopletech: oops that was meant for deebo
10:55  mastro: bloopletech, so any suggestion for which jquery tree to use?
10:56 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
10:56  bloopletech: mastro: I've used jstree before and it's ok, maybe the jquery ui tree is more supported
10:56  deebo: bloopletech: yeah works, thanks
10:56  bloopletech: deebo: np
10:57  mastro: bloopletech, and not documented as well: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tree
10:58  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/
10:58  mekwall: any feedback is welcome
10:58  mekwall: positioning is solely made with css
10:59  bloopletech: mastro: well sorry. If you don't like my recommendations ask someone else or do your own research
10:59  mahen23: eum, can i refresh a div in jquery?
10:59  bloopletech: I've only ever used jstree
10:59  RomD: refresh in which way?
10:59  mastro: bloopletech, I just told you that jquery Tree is not documented, that's why i did not choose it.. I like jstree actually... i was trying to take a suggestion
10:59  bloopletech: mastro: sorry if I'm coming across as harsh, in a snarky mood atm

10:59  mahen23: like a form, reset it to blank
11:00  bloopletech: mastro: ah, ok, sorry
11:00  mastro: bloopletech, don't worry :) that's common on IRC
11:00  RomD: mahen23: $('#myform input').val(""); I guess
11:00  mahen23: no no, the entire form, want to blank it out
11:00  mastro: bloopletech, you haven't ever been in #oracle! those are really harsh guys :P
11:01  bloopletech: mastro: thankfully.
11:01  RomD: mahen23: don't really understand what you want
11:01  bloopletech: mahen23: $("#myform").empty()
11:01  mahen23: ok will try that bloopletech
11:01  mastro: bloopletech, if you manage to get a reply (10% of the times) it will be "you are a complete idiot" (90% of the times)
11:02  mastro: (not only with me by the way)
11:02  mahen23: mastro: lets troll them?
11:02  mahen23: like Oracle Sucks!
11:02  mahen23: mySQL wins
11:02  mastro: mahen23, :) no thanks.. I need those guy somewhat :)
11:02  bloopletech: mastro: In defence, it can get annoying when people ask questions badly or appear not to have tried very hard to solve their own problems. OTOH people can be jerks
11:02  Yancho: http://pastebin.com/MiPscpWf hi i'm trying to replicate the fadeTo (line 2,3) by putting the css attributes myself. anyone can hint me how i can do the -ms-filter part please?
11:03 --- Scumeth is now known as Scum-Person
11:03  bloopletech: Yancho: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=ms-filter+reference
11:04  bloopletech: Yancho: wait... that's not going to work
11:04  mastro: bloopletech, I agree with you but most of the time if I came asking is because I don't know a damn thing and I need directions just to be able to look it myself :) it's frustrating when you look around trying hard to understand and you use the wrong keywords or simply miss some basic information :) oracle has a sucky documentation anyway :P
11:04  bloopletech: Yancho: you need to quote the -ms-filter and the filter value
11:04  bloopletech: mastro: :)
11:04  Yancho: bloopletech, quote ' or " ?
11:05  bloopletech: Yancho: probably "
11:06  mastro: bloopletech, jstree is very cool but may be overkilling. what do you think if this? http://mkhudon.com/treeview/ have you ever tried it?
11:06  Yancho: bloopletech, like this? { config.$leftnavbutton.css({ opacity: 1 , "-ms-filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=100)", filter: alpha(opacity=100) }) }
11:06  mastro: replace(/if/, "of")

11:07  triggertoo: hi, i wanna create a fade effect which directly fades from an image to another, without fading the first one completely out
11:08  triggertoo: any suggestions what's the easiest way to do this?
11:08  bloopletech: Yancho: sorry I meant { opacity: 1 , "-ms-filter": "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=100)", filter: "alpha(opacity=100)" }
11:08  bloopletech: triggertoo: start facving one out then start fading the other in in the same space - you
11:08  bloopletech: *you'll get a crossfade
11:09  bloopletech: mastro: no I haven't used it
11:09  mastro: bloopletech, thanks
11:09  bloopletech: mastro: np
11:09  triggertoo: bloopletech: with overlapping divs?
11:10  bloopletech: triggertoo: you can do that, or you can make the images display: block and overlap them directly - or you can look around for a crossfade plugin
11:10  Lee_msi: anyone have any experience with ckfinder ?? or know somewhere i can source help without waiting a week for a reply in their forum
11:10  triggertoo: ok thanks, don't wanna use plugins for that, should be simple enough to do that
11:11  kaseano: clarkfischer have you got lettering.js to work ? It's so simple but doing nothing, wouldn't even know where to debug
11:12  JohnRandom: hi everyone
11:12  kaseano: there's no setup, just attach the file, run function lol, isn't doing anything tho
11:12  JohnRandom: is it just me, or doesn't return $.map() an array? Firebug keeps telling me $.map().join() wouldn't be a function
11:13  bloopletech: bbl

11:24  VagaStorm: load() loads html into an element. I found what I whanted, $(window).load(function() {
11:24  RomD: no problem
11:24  VagaStorm: :)
11:25  RomD: VagaStorm: .load with a function is the callback which is called after the element finished loading
11:26  RomD: VagaStorm: if you want to use it on just a single or a couple of elements you can use e.g. $('#img1').load(function () { ... });
11:27  kaseano: i have a Q, so js creates a class, do I need to use live or something like that to modify that class?
11:27  VagaStorm: I whanted to ensure an element with overflow property filled parent element, but that dosent work to well in ie, hence using jquery seems easier...
11:31  LionMadeOfLions: I've got a resizable with custom handles, everything is absolutely positioned, I drag the handles and see the "ui-resizable-resizing" class added to the appropriate element until I release the button, but the resizable element does not change size
11:33  Yancho: bloopletech, nothing is being added to the object. no ms-filter stuff
11:35  kaseano: hi, I'm rly stumped on what to do here, I'm creating an element with a class in js, I can't seem to select that created class though.
11:44  squeek: possibly dumb question: is it possible to have a callback when something becomes hidden, or do I have to bake in some other event?

12:32  cburgdorf: I have a droppable bound to the html node and a droppable bound some levels deeper
12:32  cburgdorf: however the html one catches the drop event even the deeper one is greedy
12:32  cburgdorf: idea!
12:33  cburgdorf: first one...bind the droppables in a specific order as it works in script.aculo.us described here: http://script.aculo.us/docs/Droppables.add.html
12:33  cburgdorf: I dont know if that applies to jquery ui as well
12:35  cburgdorf: second idea...dont bind to the html node but to a absolute layer that lays somewhere in between (hint adjust z-index) and which is no parent of the deeper level droppables

13:22  vertic4l: thanks for sharing your senseless thought, squeek
13:22  doonie: kaseano no preferebly not
13:23  kaseano: doonie it's not a good idea? the alternative would be getting the ID from the container to find the child, which is obv a lot harder
13:24  Famic: kaseano: what are you trying to get ?
13:24  doonie: easier to tell us what you want to do
13:24  Famic: you can do $(this) and work from there
13:25  kaseano: I have a bunch of similar containers for types of info, when you highlight the container I was going to have the title in that container light up
13:25  kaseano: instead of doing container_1.mouseover, highlight title_1
13:25  kaseano: it'd be nice if I could just do this (the container's) title
13:26  kaseano: if that makes sense
13:26  Famic: not making sens here
13:26  kaseano: damn lol
13:27  kaseano: ah well I'll write out the code the long way and mayb you guys can help tell me if there's a shorter way to do it
13:29  Famic: maybe something like $('.container').bind('mouseover', function(){ $(this).find('.title').addClass('.highlighted'); }); ?
13:29  kaseano: Oh that's perfect!
13:29  kaseano: why'd you use .bind instead of just .mouseover
13:29  Famic: drop the . before highlighted
13:30  Famic: I always use bind
13:30  Famic: but you can use the shortcut
13:30  kaseano: oh ok wasn't sure what the difference was. ok thx Famic
13:30  Famic: good thing with bind is that you can have namespace (i.e. .bind('mousover.whatever'..)). This makes it easier to handle add/remove events listeners
13:31  kaseano: oh well I'm not advanced enough for listeners yet luckily haha
13:32  Famic: that's what .mouseover() does, actually. It listends to the mouseover event and binds a function to it
13:33  kaseano: oh

13:49  mekwall: cburgdorf: there?
13:49  mekwall: I think I solved your problem ;)
13:49  vertic4l: Famic: if i just use that code, to recognize if its the checked radio button, everything is fine
13:49  cburgdorf: with nested droppables?
13:49  vertic4l: the problem starts, when i iterate through all input fields.
13:50  vertic4l: then i have always the unchecked and checked radio button
13:50  mekwall: cburgdorf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/pPs34/
13:50  mekwall: I also answered on SO
13:51  Famic: vertic4l: probably because the second line catches it
13:51  Ely^: sean
13:51  vertic4l: the first if statement is correct. but how do i get rid of the unchecked one?
13:51  mahen23: how do i put this spinning ajax wheel in my .ajax?
13:51  Famic: vertic4l: !$(this).is(":radio[name='anrede']:checked") -> an unchecked radio button fits that rule
13:51  mahen23: is there an example i can follow?
13:52  doonie: follow the red pill
13:52  cburgdorf: exuse me, how can I see the console in jsFiddle?
13:52  vertic4l: Famic: if( !$(this).is(":radio[name='anrede']:checked") ){ 	return true; ); 			} ?
13:52 * mahen23 looks for the red pill
13:52  mekwall: mahen23: insert image or change css class on an element before ajax request, remove it / change back when it's done? :)
13:53  mekwall: cburgdorf: shift+ctrl+i ?
13:53  mahen23: mekwall: can i do this with the .load function?
13:53  cburgdorf: oops it using the default browser console...lol never knew about that
13:53  mahen23: oh wait
13:53  mekwall: no
13:53  mahen23: where can i find one of those spinning wheels?
13:53  mekwall: mahen23: and it's called a throbber :)
13:53  vertic4l: or was it just next(); ?
13:54  mahen23: why call a spinning wheel a throbber?
13:54  mekwall: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throbber
13:54  Altreus: grr escape doesn't trigger keypress
13:54  Famic: vertic4l: just refactor... something like : for each input : if is(':radio[name='anrede']') : if :checked : ... else : ...
13:54  Altreus: how do I capture escape?
13:54  mekwall: mahen23: because it's not only a spinning wheel, it has a purpose :)
13:55  mekwall: Altreus: e.which == 27
13:55  mekwall: if I recall hehe
13:55  Altreus: mekwall: escape isn't triggering keypress :s

13:56  mekwall: 13 is enter hehe
13:58  vertic4l: refactoring is not my type of game i guess -.-
13:59  vertic4l: now i got the unchecked one, insteed of the checked one :D
14:02  Famic: vertic4l: I suppose removing the :checked from the second if would be what you want
14:04  vertic4l: Famic: no, that's not the right way, this way i get the unchecked radio button twice at the end in the alert box
14:04  JKarsrud: vertic4l: what are you trying to do?
14:04  Famic: there probably is a shorter way to do that.
14:04  vertic4l: i just need all input field without the unchecked radio button
14:05  JKarsrud: $('input:checked') then?
14:05  vertic4l: http://vertic4l.com/sharkness/index3.php
14:05  vertic4l: which means?
14:05  vertic4l: all inputs + the checked one ('s) ?
14:05  mekwall: cburgdorf: did it work?
14:06  JKarsrud: $('input:radio').filter(':checked').each() ?
14:06  vertic4l: this way i will only get the checked radio button or am i wrong ?
14:07  JKarsrud: you should
14:07  JKarsrud: I'm writing a quick test :)
14:07  vertic4l: but thats not what i want ^^
14:08  vertic4l: i need to iterate through all input fields... there will be more soon.. and just wanna have all input fields except the unchecked ones ^^
14:08  cburgdorf: mekwall: in this given example it seems to work. However Im still trying to figure out how this is any different from mine. In addition I must say that my weird behaviour only occures in Firefox. And in this jsFiddle I figured out that the draggables will get locked after drop in FF while still beeing free after drop in Chrome...
14:08  Famic: $('input').filter(':radio:not(:checked)').each(...)
14:08  mekwall: cburgdorf: interesting :)
14:09  vertic4l: sounds good, let me
14:09  mekwall: cburgdorf: don't forget to accept/vote on SO :D
14:09  cburgdorf: thats not me asking on SO ;-)
14:09  vertic4l: dont work
14:10  jomofcw: "doESn't work"
14:10  jomofcw: :D
14:10  vertic4l: oh ya
14:10  vertic4l: damn
14:10  vertic4l: ^^
14:10  Famic: define doesn't work
14:10  ss23: It won't get a job!
14:10  jomofcw: just a joke, I'm really the worst here about english writing :)
14:10  JKarsrud: vertical, hell yeah it works
14:10  vertic4l: i only get the unchecked radio button value this way
14:11  vertic4l: how ?
14:11  Famic: so you get just the opposite of what you want ?
14:11  cburgdorf: mekwall: but maybe the answer why it is locked after drop in FF has to do with the whole weird stuff going on within my app ;-)
14:11  vertic4l: ya, exactly Famic
14:11  Famic: replace filter with not
14:12  vertic4l: haha amazing!
14:12  jomofcw: Jquery is amazing :)
14:12  jomofcw: We should quote each time someone write "amazing" here.
14:12  kaseano: i have this really simple code w xcolor, it's sorta buggy tho, am I doing it correctly? (color changes on mouseover, returns on mouseout) http://pastie.org/1459860
14:12  JKarsrud: vertic4l: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/7gENM/
14:13  vertic4l: Famic: Thanks a lot.
14:13  JKarsrud: sorry, was busy, so didn't save it :P
14:13  Famic: np. as you can see: "code less, do mor" ;)
14:13  vertic4l: JKarsrud: Famic already had the solution. But thanks anyway for your time!
14:13  JKarsrud: okay, well, mine's better
14:13  JKarsrud: :P
14:13  Famic: lol
14:14  Famic: not even sure it gets the job done ;p
14:14  JKarsrud: wha,tm ine?
14:14  vertic4l: JKarsrud, nice example!
14:14  vertic4l: but will just work at radio buttons
14:14  vertic4l: not at mixed input types
14:14  kaseano: oh nevermind i think xcolor (instead of color) was my problem
14:14  Famic: see
14:15  JKarsrud: vertic4l: Well then just modify it :)
14:15  JKarsrud: It's not hard at all
14:15  cburgdorf: mekwall: its so strange, sometimes its freezed after drop, sometimes not. But only in FF. How is it for u? http://jsfiddle.net/M8g3R/8/
14:15  vertic4l: Famic gave me the hint i was looking for
14:15  Famic: you just have to say out loud what you want to select... then tranlate that to jquery ;)
14:15  vertic4l: i ve tested a lot yesterday, but never came up with that short nice code he did
14:15  vertic4l: ^^
14:16  afeijo: why this doesnt work? $('body').resize(function() { $.log('resized'); });
14:17  Famic: ?doesn't work
14:17  bot-t: What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
14:17  afeijo: nothing happens :)
14:17  afeijo: when I resize the browser
14:17  mahen23: i told firefail to: $("#TestDrive_error").load("css/ajax-loader.gif");
14:17  mahen23: and it gave me the garbled GIF
14:17  vertic4l: what is firefail? :D
14:17  mahen23: with encodings and all
14:18  mahen23: firefail = big / lazy / slow Firefox
14:18  vertic4l: :D
14:18  mekwall: cburgdorf: it's not strange hehe... it's when firebug is closed
14:19  afeijo: found it! I should use $(window) :D
14:19  mekwall: cburgdorf: if you close firebug, it will fail miserably with console is not defined
14:19  mekwall: cburgdorf: in chrome, console is always defined ;)
14:19  cburgdorf: umm...ok ;-)
14:20  mekwall: hehe
14:20  vertic4l: have a nice day everyone, see you later.
14:20  JKarsrud: vertic4l: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/7gENM/1/
14:21  JKarsrud: that good enough for ya?
14:21  vertic4l: hehe
14:21  vertic4l: ya its nearly that what i wanted
14:22  vertic4l: famic came up with:
14:22  vertic4l: $(".steps_content_right input").not(':radio:not(:checked)').each(function(){ 			values.push( $(this).attr('value') ); 		});
14:22  vertic4l: which does what i wanted to have
14:22  JKarsrud: well, so does mine tho, so use whichever you want
14:22  Famic: you can remove the :radio in the .not, btw
14:22  vertic4l: 'cause next / last step is to write all values in html, for overview
14:22  JKarsrud: yeah
14:22  vertic4l: ah ok :D
14:23  JKarsrud: but I don't see why .filter() is worse than not tho
14:23  JKarsrud: When I use :not(:checked) in the filter
14:23  vertic4l: i dont know
14:23  vertic4l: never used .filter and :not so far
14:23  erichynds: :not() is css3, so it'll map to QSA, but only if you do :not([checked])
14:23  Famic: filter only keeps defined targets instead of removing them
14:24  mahen23: of course it would not work
14:24 * mahen23 slaps himself
14:24  JKarsrud: erichynds: alright
14:25  mahen23: erichynds: hey dude, how are you?
14:25  JKarsrud: we all learn something new each day :)
14:25  erichynds: mahen23, good! how are you?
14:25  cburgdorf: mekwall: well this example definitly works as expected...I need to figure out why my isnt..
14:25  mahen23: erichynds: feelin tired, waiting for the weekend. You read my mail, i corrected the bug....
14:26  erichynds: ya i did, good to hear
14:26  mekwall: cburgdorf: show some code! :)
14:26  vertic4l: Famic: you were wrong. :radio has to be there
14:26  vertic4l: otherwise it just selects the radio button
14:26  vertic4l: and not everything else too
14:27  Famic: right... a text input is always not checked
14:27  vertic4l: ;)
14:28  cburgdorf: mekwall: I need to break it down to a test case...its however, very jqgrid related...the whole issue begins with another bug. I shouldnt be in need for nested droppables at all in first place
14:28  mekwall: erichynds: I borrowed some of your code ;)
14:28  JKarsrud: vertic4l: That's why mine was better :P
14:28  erichynds: nice
14:28  erichynds: which parts/
14:28  mekwall: erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/33/ <--- just the instancing part, thought that was really nice
14:28  vertic4l: :D
14:28  erichynds: oh word
14:29  vertic4l: i saved it  as a precaution
14:29  erichynds: you're pumping these widgets out like a machine
14:29  tcampion: has anyone tried loading the accordian for external php script?
14:29  mekwall: erichynds: hehe, well I need them for work
14:30  mekwall: erichynds: admin interface, and I'm missing all  these widgets... so churning them out as fast as I can
14:30  erichynds: nice
14:30  JKarsrud: vertic4l: this uses qSA even
14:30  JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/7gENM/2/
14:30  JKarsrud: if it's supported :)
14:30  cburgdorf: mekwall: I guess we would need a whole skype / teamviewer session to discuss this from ground up...
14:30  vertic4l: btw, whats qsa?
14:30  erichynds: mekwall, the only thing i didn't like about creating & returning a new instance widget is that it breaks the chain
14:30  JKarsrud: querySelectorAll
14:30  vertic4l: oh ok
14:31  JKarsrud: ?mdc qsa
14:31  bot-t: JKarsrud, Web Tech Blog » Blog Archive » querySelector[All] - https://developer.mozilla.org/web-tech/2008/07/22/queryselectorall/
14:31  JKarsrud: ?mdc querySelectorAll
14:31  bot-t: JKarsrud, document.querySelectorAll - Returns a list of the elements within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes) that match the specified group of selectors. The object returned is a NodeList . https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/document.querySelectorAll
14:31  JKarsrud: that's better :)
14:31  mekwall: erichynds: hmm, in what way?
14:31  mekwall: erichynds: well, my first implementation I created the object inside the create function
14:32  vertic4l: mekwall: nice shit! i like those stuff
14:32  mekwall: erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/28/
14:32  mekwall: like that
14:32  erichynds: mekwall, you can't do $("#foo").notification().css() or whatever because it returns the
14:32  erichynds: widget instance
14:32  erichynds: not #foo
14:32  mekwall: ahh, I see
14:32  mekwall: well you should be able to rememedy that
14:33  erichynds: you could add an end() to the prototype that returns this.parent
14:33  erichynds: so you can work with the instance, then when done, return to the chain
14:33  sean`: or just return this;
14:34  erichynds: yeah, but having it return the notification object it created is also pretty baller
14:34  erichynds: so you can programatically call methods and shit on it
14:34  tcampion: has anyone tried loading the accordian from an external php script?
14:34  erichynds: while creating new instances after it
14:34  sean`: .data ('notifcation')
14:34  mekwall: erichynds: not needed mate :) you can return this directly in create
14:34  mekwall: erichynds: push the notification into an array
14:34  erichynds: ehhhh
14:34  mekwall: and then have a widget function
14:36  erichynds: yeah
14:36  erichynds: but if you open like 5 instances and you need the 3rd
14:36  erichynds: you don't have an easy reference to it
14:36  erichynds: if any of them close in between you've lost the position in the array
14:37  mekwall: not really
14:37  mekwall: you can just get the index as a reference
14:37  VictorCL: when there is a line jump insinde the .html()  .. it wont work :(
14:37  erichynds: i think the index is subject to change though
14:37  erichynds: like what if diff parts of your app are opening notifications at the same time
14:38  mekwall: erichynds: not if you call it directly :)
14:38  mekwall: you can have an index function to return the previously added notification
14:39  erichynds: then you run into race conditions :)
14:39  erichynds: oh snap, i broke the build
14:39  erichynds: brrrrbbb
14:40 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
14:40  JKarsrud: hah
14:46  VictorCL: whats the easiet way to escape line breaks .. it breaks html()
14:46  Lumpio-: "breaks html()"?
14:47  Lumpio-: Are you sure your problem even have anything to do with html() ?
14:47  VictorCL: well ... javascript dont accpet line breaks so it mess up
14:47  astropirate: I am working on a "Map" for a hobby browser game. Has anyone done something like this with jquery? i can't seem to be able to find anythign after h ours of googling
14:47  squeek: VictorCL: \ at the end of every line
14:48  Lumpio-: VictorCL: That's like saying "alert() doesn't work because I put invalid syntax inside the parenthesis"
14:48  Lumpio-: And yeah, escape the actualy newline character with \.
14:48  VictorCL: no .. I take this text from a textarea and then put it in some other place with .html() ... but if the text from textarea has a line breaks .. the .html() wont work
14:49  Lumpio-: VictorCL: That's like saying "alert() doesn't work because I put invalid syntax inside the parenthesis"
14:49  cburgdorf: mekwall: I might have a test case
14:49  mekwall: erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/
14:49  cburgdorf: mekwall: have a look at this...http://jsfiddle.net/h8FDm/
14:50  cburgdorf: mekwall: the red one stays there after drop
14:50  jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/h8FDm/
14:50  cburgdorf: because the origin element has been removed before dropping ends
14:51  cburgdorf: thats the case in my jqgrid example...I move from table a to table b while the original row which is beeing moved is already gone because the user has set a filter
14:51  mekwall: cburgdorf:  function(){ $('#red').remove(); } ?!
14:51  cburgdorf: yes, read above
14:51  mekwall: cburgdorf: of course red will stay there
14:51  tcampion: has anyone tried loading the accordian from an external php script?
14:51  cburgdorf: yes but it shouldnt
14:52  cburgdorf: its just the clone
14:52  jomofcw: cburgdorf according to me it's normal
14:52  jomofcw: you should missunderstood the "clone" use of dragging element
14:52  jomofcw: Hm... the clone should remove too... not sure
14:52  cburgdorf: give me a second to explain the whole case...;-)
14:53  cburgdorf: jqgrid, two tables a and b
14:53  cburgdorf: both filled with rows
14:53  cburgdorf: the user can move rows from table a to table b
14:54  JKarsrud: tcampion: wtf are you talking about?
14:54  noaXess: how do i use the CSS scope in jquery-ui? have two different jquery-ui themes on same page...
14:54  jomofcw: tcampion you should mess it up :) PHP = server side, JS = client side
14:54  cburgdorf: now the bug happens when: the user moves a row...while it is beeing moved the original row vanished because any filter was applied (he set this filter just a millisecond before he decided to move the row)
14:55  erichynds: mekwall, oh, i get it
14:55  erichynds: cool
14:55  cburgdorf: now when the row is beeing dropped on table b, AND the original row isnt present anymore, the clone wont disapea
14:55  fris: with datepicker can you use time as well like certain date at 12pm
14:55  cburgdorf: dissapear
14:55  cburgdorf: damn, how is it spelled disappear ;-)
14:56  mekwall: erichynds: not sure if that's the best way to do it, but at least you keep the chaining intact :)
14:56  jomofcw: cburgdorf the thing I missunderstood is why you use clone if you remove the original one as soon as drag start... it's the default wait it works without clone :s
14:56  erichynds: mekwall, yah i'd say so.  cuz in reality, how often do devs need to interact with the notification? probably not often
14:56  jomofcw: s/wait/way/
14:56  erichynds: it either auto closes or users will close it
14:56  mekwall: cburgdorf: I'm afraid I have to leave you hanging... gotta do some work :P
14:56  mekwall: erichynds: that's what I thought ;)
14:57  cburgdorf: mmh...clone is the default option jqgrid uses internally...
14:57  jomofcw: cburgdorf that should be waht I missunderstood : I don't use jqgrid :/.
14:58  jomofcw: cburgdorf if you could overwrite this default option try to turn clone to false
14:58  jomofcw: according me, it's the way you would it to work
14:59  johnmartirano: I'm using jquery tabs in a webapp with a Rails backend, as I understand it the code in tabTemplate is used for javascript injection when adding a tab dynamically, however, normal rendering of the page uses an html (erb) file, so i'm trying to DRY the code by removing tabTemplate, but if I do that the tab-close-icon of any added tabs wont render until the next refresh.  Any ideas?
14:59  cburgdorf: jomofcw...in my example...even if u just drag it elsewhere the clone isnt hiding anymore...is this really what we want?
14:59  cburgdorf: just because the original element has gone?
15:00  cburgdorf: if I use "clone" this suggests me that I work decoupled from the original element
15:00  jomofcw: cburgdorf I think it's a specific case, try to turn clone on false and to handle the ending callback to process the original element as you want.
15:02  VictorCL: ehhhhhh
15:02  VictorCL: friday ... goind home
15:03  cburgdorf: u know what, I cant take the original because what if the user filtered that away just while he is dragging it
15:03  cburgdorf: I need it to be decoupled from the original...I guess thats why jqGrid decided to go this way
15:05  gsnedders: Is there any reason why Opera should see different number of tests in test-suite on different platforms?
15:07  gsnedders: (And it just being down to a bug in the build is entirely plausible.)
15:08  cambazz: hello, i need a search bar with context, like in istockphoto.com
15:08  cambazz: basically, keyword entry, and a select bar, and search button
15:09  cambazz: the thing is it could be quite tricky to make something like that
15:09  cambazz: that is cross browser comptible
15:09  cambazz: any ideas  or plugins that will make my life easier?
15:10  johnmartirano: Rather than use tabTemplate for jquery tabs - how would I inject the tabs already filled out header directly?
15:11  cburgdorf: there must be a way to use draggable which might disappear right in the second u are dragging them...
15:12  cburgdorf: u know, thats why I had a big outter droppable that catches thoses drops and cleans up those clones laying around...
15:19  astropirate: I am working on a "Map" for a hobby browser game. Has anyone done something like this with jquery? i can't seem to be able to find anythign after h ours of googling

15:20  astropirate: squeek, yes
15:21  squeek: Then use it, I guess. it's open source.

15:41  RingZer0: So, love jQ, works great with webapps... what about using it to automate user-tasks _on_ the web... e.g. autoit or this plugin for firefox: http://www.iopus.com/imacros/firefox
15:41  RingZer0: Any thoughts?
15:41  vertic4l: you cant change mouse position with js
15:42  RingZer0: vertic4l: you dont need to with selectors and .click()
15:42  vertic4l: hm nice thought
15:42  vertic4l: just emulate the click instead
15:42  RingZer0: that's the beauty of it... you can actually run a full script... e.g. our mail provider is fusemail
15:43  RingZer0: I have to go into every account and change their sub accounts to user accounts.
15:43  RingZer0: no way to mass-do this
15:43  RingZer0: just hte page load times it will take me 2 hrs
15:43  RingZer0: since it does not need the mouse, I could actually do something else
15:44  RingZer0: looks like im going to make a firefox plugin
15:45  vertic4l: crazy shit

15:48  VonGodric: hello. I got a small question: when using scroll event. is it possible to distinguish between user initiated scroll from the scroll event that happens when browser window reloads and its scroll position is somewhere down?
15:49  timmywil: vongodric: you could grab the initial scroll position on page load and keep track that way
15:53  letsgojuno: bump: can anyone see why sortable is never being called here http://jsfiddle.net/letsgojuno/cv5GU/1/
15:54  Jonz: VonGodric, my hunch is that you cannot reliably tell the difference between those two events.. is it possible to fix the the UI/UX issue which makes users refresh the page?
15:54  VonGodric: timmywil: thanks. I will investigate this.
15:55  VonGodric: Jonz: I guess not. But it seems I can get the initial scroll size. hopefully
15:55  Aamir: letsgojuno: sortable works after u drag it to the container
15:55  Jonz: make sure you do it on window load, not document ready
15:56  letsgojuno: Aamir, it should but, once the items are dragged into the container sort doesnt work :?
15:59  erichynds: letsgojuno, try doing a .sortable('refresh') after you move the items
15:59  erichynds: so sortable can recognize them
15:59  markj: does anyone know how to load a page fragment using the full ajax method rather than the load method? i assumed I would just do /url #whatever but it just returns all of the html

16:01  Shwaiil: Q: I'm wondering how to create a confirm dialog trough jquery ? Any sugestions ? Tks
16:01 --- Phil is now known as Phil-Work
16:02  erichynds: Shwaiil, there is an example of one on jqueryui.com dialog widget docs.  also see blockUI, or one of the other hundred modal plugins out there..
16:03  Shwaiil: erichynds, thanks for looking. I didnt want to use plugins for this, I would like to make my own (i'm learning). I guess if I bind mouseclick and send the event, I can pass the href and use the url if Yes or Return false if no ? something like this ?
16:04  erichynds: I don't follow
16:04  markj: doesnt seem like it's possible, might just use load, i can't imagine using find('#selector') on the returned data is as fast
16:04  letsgojuno: erichynds that seems to call myappend function again see http://jsfiddle.net/letsgojuno/cv5GU/3/

16:12  thepacmanfan: i don't quite grasp Drupal 7's implementation of jQuery UI.
16:12  thepacmanfan: i'm trying to use accordion. do i need to include the specific accordion JS file?
16:14  netking: i would imagine, drupal comes with jquery ui but accordion is another addon
16:15  thepacmanfan: well, i have included jquery.ui.accordion.min.js
16:15  blup: are there jquery features that don't work in ie7?
16:16  thepacmanfan: but jQuery('#faq-gen').accordion();   does nothing
16:16  koriel: hi there..i want to use a $.post method to get an entity (a product ie) and then update input elements on my page...how can I just update those inputs at once with $('#price').val(price) ... etc..
16:16  ss23: Ajax?
16:17  ss23: That's how I do it
16:17  ss23: Wait
16:17  ss23: That is ajax?
16:17 * ss23 hides
16:17  koriel: yes..but i use something like this $.post("file.php",{id:id},function(data){ });
16:18  koriel: the data can it be an array or something?
16:18  JKarsrud: koriel: does it return json?
16:18  netking: thepacmanfun, not familiar with drupal but make sure you include the plugin.js file before the file you try to call it from
16:19  JKarsrud: koriel: return it from php as json, as an array of objects or something. Then just loop it and set the data or something :)
16:19  koriel: ok thx...got it
16:19  thepacmanfan: netking: the code i pasted is inline... the plugin is being included before that.
16:19  JKarsrud: but then you could just use $.getJSON('file.php',{id:id}, function(resp) {});
16:20  JKarsrud: Or do you need to post it?
16:20  JKarsrud: ahh, wait
16:20  JKarsrud: You're posting the data from the form, and want the data back into the form at once, yeah?
16:20  netking: pacman do you have firefox with firebug or chrome with javascript debug on? it may help you figure out whats stopping it
16:25  timmywil: koriel, JKarsrud, post will work, you can still set the datatype you expect from the server, which will be "json",  so $.post( url, data, successFn, "json").  It depends on whether you need to post or not.  If not, just use getJSON.  boom.
16:25  netking: anyone got any insight on why i'm unable to access the same map and reposition/zoom it in google maps v3? i can do everything else but can't figure this part out
16:26  JKarsrud: timmywil: yeah, I know :)
16:26  timmywil: k
16:26  JKarsrud: That's whay I suggested, until I realized he probably actually posted some more data, not just the id
16:26  JKarsrud: =)
16:27  JKarsrud: why I suggested it, even
16:27  timmywil: yesyes
16:27  JKarsrud: meh, sucks that a form needs to have a button in it in order to be submitted
16:27  JKarsrud: even if you use .submit();
16:28  thepacmanfan: netking: i just tried chrome js debug, and it's showing an error in the accordion script, but no errors when i try and trigger accordion running...
16:28  thepacmanfan: also, what do you mean "access the same map"?
16:29  netking: i can send the options to move/zoom the map but its not the same one i am working with
16:29 --- fabiomcosta_ is now known as fabiomcosta
16:30  thepacmanfan: err... umm... no idea. i've only worked with one map.
16:30  netking: anytime i've seen the error in the plugins.js file i'm either sending it the wrong stuff, didn't configure it properly or it sounds like drupal could need more info
16:30  netking: i dont have more then 1 map at this point, i just can't send the options to the correct map, can't figure it out for days
16:31  netking: i can send markers and wait for events and everything
16:32  thepacmanfan: k... the only thing i've done with gmaps is send markers and position the viewport
16:32  thepacmanfan: no idea about options :(

16:32  netking: is your accordion.js file loaded after the jquery.ui.js file?
16:32  Aamir: i have  $li  which is   jQUery(li.atItem)    how can unwrap to get the dom object?
16:33  Aamir: ah got it  - its .get
16:33  thepacmanfan: wait, jquery.ui.js needs to be loaded?   i'm loaded jquery.js, then jquery.once.js, then jquery.ui.accordion.js
16:34  thepacmanfan: loaded = loading
16:34  netking: Note: This module depends on the jquery_ui module. Please install jquery_ui module
16:34  timmywil: need the ui core for any widgets to work
16:34  Bartzy: Hi, I'm having a problem in IE (8) . Using jScrollPane and jquery 1.4.2, sometimes it doesn't load (and the scrollbar remains the browser one), and the whole JS seems "stuck", like the events haven't been bound.
16:35  thepacmanfan: netking: oh.. err... uhh... where did you find that?
16:35  Bartzy: Anyone know of this problem in IE ? Other browsers work great.
16:35  thepacmanfan: hmm, my bad! let me go try that.
16:35  netking: teh google told me
16:35  Aamir: is there a better of doing things like        $('.atLeftFloated').find($li.get()[0].nodeName)
16:35  thepacmanfan: i just need jquery.ui.core.min.js?
16:36  netking: i was confused about jquery.ui at first, thought each widget used its own, theres a bunch of different pieces you load to use different ui stuff too
16:36  thepacmanfan: i don't see that text on the overview of jquery ui accordion docs... hmm
16:36  thepacmanfan: but it makes sense ;)
16:37  timmywil: aamir: can you just do $('.atLeftFloated').find('li')?
16:37  Aamir: timmywil:   $li is a jquery object
16:37  timmywil: aamir: true, but a jquery object with li elements?
16:37  Aamir: timmywil:  no sorry my example is bad...
16:37  timmywil: judging from the name $li
16:38  timmywil: ok then, .get()[0] is redundant, you can do [0] or .get(0)
16:38  Bartzy: Anyone know about a problem in jQuery and IE (8) where sometimes the JS doesn't "load" (maybe document.ready isn't happening)?
16:38  Aamir: timmywil:  http://gyazo.com/b489d277f828510643b55bf920e360f6.png
16:38  Vorspire: Bartzy; quirks mode?
16:38  timmywil: or slice(0,1)
16:38  Bartzy: No
16:39  netking: bartzy: asynchronous code not finishing at time the page loads?
16:39  timmywil: aamir: so it is a jquery object of lis, not find($li), but find('li')
16:40  netking: one of my gmaps is hacked up nice and doesn't load in chrome sometimes but does elsewhere because the browser gets done before the script is ready
16:40  Aamir: $li is a specific LI from a long list of lis in OL
16:40  Bartzy: netking: What do you mean ?
16:40  timmywil: aamir, ohhh, you just want to select the first one?
16:40  Aamir: timmywil:  i select $li using      $li = $body.find("li[aria-describedby='"+layerName+"']");
16:42  timmywil: tell me what you're trying to do
16:42  Bartzy: netking ?
16:42  netking: bartzy: this is where that callback function thing comes in, that allows your script to let everyone else know when its ready, instead of just assuming its done and calling it
16:42  timmywil: ?first @aamir
16:42  bot-t: aamir, .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
16:42  thepacmanfan: aha! including core and widget solved it. thanks folks!
16:42  timmywil: ?eq @ aamir
16:42  bot-t: aamir, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
16:42  Altreus: Is return false the correct way of disabling links, or preventDefault? In the click handler
16:42  Aamir: http://gyazo.com/ef7933a4328dc07ae719084b9f8e2eff.png
16:42  Bartzy: netking: I don't understand how it relates to my problem ? What exactly do you mean ?
16:43  Bartzy: I have $(document).ready()...
16:43  netking: yea but your script does not run in ie, i was saying maybe its because the document is ready but your code is not finished yet
16:44  Aamir: timmywil:   i think i need to go other way around  if ( $li.parents(' .atLeftFloated ').length != 0 ) {.....}
16:44  Bartzy: netking: OK... how come it works in other browsers ?
16:44  timmywil: aamir: i don't understand what you're asking for, sry
16:45  netking: because ie might be getting it done quicker, i doubt that but its possible
16:45  JKarsrud: if(!$li.parents('.atLeftFloated').length) {} is better
16:45  Aamir: timmywil: never mind, got the idea
16:45  timmywil: altreus, see ?preventDefault
16:45  bot-t: altreus, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
16:45  netking: chrome puts my page together so fast google maps isn't ready, other browsers dont finish quickly enough for there to be a problem
16:45  timmywil: altreus, nvm
16:45  timmywil: it depends
16:46  Aamir: netking:  fast is sometime bad :P
16:46  netking: yea but ie?
16:46  netking: lol
16:46  timmywil: returns false will do both event.stopPropagation and event.preventDefault.  If you don't want stopPropagation, then just do preventDefault.  If it doesn't matter, do return false;
16:46  Altreus: timmywil: Thanks :)
16:46  netking: only reason i caught on with my issue was remembering chrome is wai faster
16:47  timmywil: np
16:47  triggertoo: are there any known issues with .outerWidth() and webkit browser?
16:48  triggertoo: i always get 0, but works on ff and all ie's
16:48  Altreus: also: .live() binds to current stuff as well, doesn't it? The docs suggest so, but my callback apparently is not happening, so I'm just tracking that down.
16:48  JKarsrud: Altreus: it does
16:48  Bartzy: window[current_page]['init'](); that is legal? (current_page contains 'select_photo', which is an object I have in JS that contain init() function)
16:49  JKarsrud: Altreus: the event handler?
16:49  JKarsrud: is that what doesn't fire?
16:49  Altreus: ffffffuuuuuu I'm so stupid
16:49  Altreus: I had stopImmediatePropagation() in body's click handler
16:49  JKarsrud: lol
16:50  JKarsrud: yeah, that could be a problem :P
16:50  Bartzy: OK I understood the problem, I think
16:50  Altreus: It was the right thing for it to be doing when I wrote it but that's all changed now ._.
16:50  Bartzy: For some reason, IE triggers $(document).ready() ONLY when all images on the page has been loaded.. why is that ?
16:50  netking: thats when the document is ready? i think
16:51  Altreus: yeah but the dom is ready way earlier. seems odd
16:51  JKarsrud: netking: nope
16:51  netking: what about the poor unloaded images when the document boat takes off tho?
16:51  JKarsrud: the document is ready before images have loaded
16:52  Bartzy: JKarsrud: Why is that happening ?
16:52  netking: and when you say nope, doesn't that mean yes in ie terms since the browser is backasswards?
16:52  Bartzy: lol
16:52  JKarsrud: Bartzy: no fucking idea :P
16:52  Bartzy: Damn :\
16:53  Altreus: which IE
16:53  JKarsrud: 8
16:53  JKarsrud: ?
16:53  netking: ya
16:54  Bartzy: yes.
16:55  timmywil: there's a ticket for dom ready in IE right now, might have something to do with that
16:56  netking: you could just do what i do, dont use ie and hold ppl at gun point forcing them to use chrome or firefox
16:56  Bartzy: timmywil: Can you please share a link ?
16:56  JonMarkGo: Is there any way to trigger one script when another script has finished running?
16:57  JonMarkGo: Like if I have a remote include that runs on document.ready, how do I run my code only when that is complete
16:57  erichynds: in the success/complete handler
16:58  JonMarkGo: What if I can't modify the source js
16:59  thepacmanfan: thanks for the help, netking

17:01  bot-t: Line#275 - "ready: function( fn ) { jQuery.bindReady(); if ( jQuery.isReady ) { fn.call( document, jQuery ); } else if ( readyList ) { readyList.push( fn ); } return this; }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#275

17:55  thinkt4nk_work: can one use addClass to add a pseudo class?
17:55  Krambfhase: Which of the following is correct? [] jQuery is a JSON Library [] jQuery is a JavaScript Library
17:56  Altreus: the latter ...
17:56  Bartzy: I have a problem where IE won't fire .ready() on document until all images are loaded...
17:56  Altreus: a JSON library doesn't make much sense.
17:57  Bartzy: mekwall: Maybe you know anything about it ? Banging my head with this issue all day long..
17:58  Krambfhase: Bartzy: how about just moving your script code to the bottom of <body> so there is no need to wait for .ready() ?
17:58  Bartzy: Krambfhase: So why use document.ready() at all ?
17:58 --- k1t_ is now known as k1t
17:59  Krambfhase: Bartzy: well, thats the question i am asking you!
17:59  Altreus: because the document won't be ready until *after* the script tag has been parsed :)
17:59  Bartzy: Krambfhase: I'm using a lot of jquery plugins and stuff... It won't break them if I don't use document.ready?
17:59  Krambfhase: :/
17:59  Krambfhase: ?TIAS
17:59  bot-t: Try It And See
17:59  Bartzy: :\
17:59  Bartzy: ok thanks
17:59  Altreus: Bartzy: I don't know whether it's exactly equivalent or not, but I use $(function()  instead of $(document).ready(function
18:00  Luffha: i want to load a <table> structure, when i hover on a specific element...how do i do that?
18:00  Bartzy: it's exactly equivalent..
18:00  Altreus: Bartzy: It might be that JQ is smart about IE and does the right thing
18:00  Altreus: oh right
18:00  Altreus: ._.
18:00  bakers: How do I find the text of a select when I know the value is 123?
18:00  bakers: The best I could come up with was $("#select option[value=123]").text() is there a better way?
18:00  Altreus: That's what I'd do
18:01  ajpiano: Bartzy, that doesn't make a lick of sense that ready is waiting for images ONLY FOR YOU
18:01  ghettobillgates: hello, is it possible to call jquery w/in a simple php script?
18:01  Bartzy: ajpiano: I can show you... :|
18:01  Altreus: ghettobillgates: no
18:01  ghettobillgates: I cant get my redirect working so I was hoping a jquery redirect can be called
18:01  ghettobillgates: fuck!
18:01  Altreus: ghettobillgates: jquery runs on a browser
18:01  ghettobillgates: fuck php, fuck html4
18:01  Altreus: php runs on a server
18:01  ghettobillgates: makes sense, my bad
18:02  Altreus: You could run a PHP script that outputs the text for jquery ...
18:02  ghettobillgates: I cant even echo out the window.location
18:02  Bartzy: ajpiano: See http://apps.facebook.com/photomaniafx on IE8
18:02  Altreus: suspect other things may be wrong :)
18:02  Bartzy: if you're willing to..
18:04  ghettobillgates: Altreus: you jquery ninja! I was echoing it with single quotes and not double quotes and PHP started crying so I slapped it in the face and it works now! Thanks dude

18:07  gkatsev: can I add myself to it?
18:07  ajpiano: pull req baby
18:08  Bartzy: ajpiano: So you won't do it ? :\ I can't testcase because it happens only there.. maybe an iframe issue or whatever
18:08  Bartzy: I'm banging my head with this all day long... stupid IE :p
18:08  gkatsev: oh, that's why I want to add to my site. the promotejs.com thing

18:11  ngharo: nm was just slow to respond :)
18:12  Krambfhase: Bartzy: why not inster the images later?
18:12  Krambfhase: *insert
18:12  Bartzy: Because it's a hack. It shouldn't happen.
18:12  Bartzy: and now I notice that it happens on another page, not involving images...
18:12  Bartzy: ready() just doesn't happen.
18:13  Krambfhase: IE ist a hack. It shoulnd never happend.

18:18  semaphore: if i $('.foo
18:18  semaphore: if i $('#foo').empty() what is $('#foo').text() ? '' ?
18:18  Krambfhase: ?text @ semaphore
18:18  bot-t: semaphore, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
18:20  semaphore: so it depends on whitespace, i guess
18:20  timmywil: if you empty, there is not text
18:20  factorial: anyone know why someone would do $(window).something rather than just window.something ?
18:21  timmywil: factorial, if they want to use jquery
18:21  factorial: and is $(window).resize(ResizeFrame) basically the same as window.onresize = ResizeFrame ?
18:22  factorial: i'm sure there's some kind of jquery event subscription handling or something, but basically
18:22  devinrolsen: For the life of me, I can't seem to gather the account number out of this markup and assign it to a variable. Any suggestions?? http://pastebin.com/fgeY98id
18:22  timmywil: no, jQuery tries to use the best options for event binding in each browser
18:22  timmywil: .onresize isn't really your best option
18:23  factorial: timmywil: so the answer to my question is yes, basically that's what it's doing, but jquery chooses better methods where available.
18:23  factorial: thanks
18:23  timmywil: well, the answer is no, i don't think it ever uses that option
18:23  timmywil: even in ie
18:24  devinrolsen: var n = $("li.selected a .account-full",this).html().remove('span'); or var n = $j("li.selected a .account-full",this).remove('span').html(); fails every time.

18:24  bot-t: devinrolsen, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
18:24  factorial: timmywil: any way to find out what event is subscribed to when someone does $(window).resize() ?
18:24  timmywil: devinrolsen, are you meaning to find a .account-full inside an a tag?

18:25  bot-t: Line#2960 - "jQuery.each( ("blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick " +" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#2960
18:25  factorial: timmywil: i need to remove that event handler in later code that can not use jquery
18:25  devinrolsen: I just want the account number timmywil.. when using text it seems to gather the text from <span class="closed">closed</span> as well.
18:26  devinrolsen: and <span class="closed">closed</span> is not always the same. it could be <span class="active">active</span>
18:26  devinrolsen: or <span class="pending">pending</span> and so on.
18:26  Krambfhase: devinrolsen: then use a regexp to extract the acciount number
18:26  devinrolsen: really.
18:26  timmywil: so you want all the text in account full that is not part of a a span in account-full?
18:27  devinrolsen: yes
18:27  devinrolsen: just the account number.
18:27  timmywil: factorial: ok, in that case your simplest option is onresize
18:27  devinrolsen: with out having to write a bunch of regex.

18:28  factorial: timmywil: sadly, i can't remove the jquery code that does $(window).resize() -- i just have to unsubscribe that resize handler after the fact, and not using jquery. is there any info somewhere on the various handlers .resize() might choose to use?
18:28  factorial: s/various handlers/various events/

18:30  factorial: awesome bot
18:30  timmywil: so if jquery is on the page, why can't you use jquery?
18:30  factorial: thanks timmywil
18:30  timmywil: ok np
18:30  devinrolsen: tinnywil - yes, ONLY the account number in .account-full
18:30  factorial: timmywil: long story. short version: the page is being hosted within another html page which is acting like a browser. the "host browser" html does not have & can not include jquery js
18:30  devinrolsen: timmywil*
18:31  timmywil: factorial: that's a strange one
18:31  factorial: timmywil: yeah :)
18:31  Bartzy: ajpiano, or anyone else... I think I narrowed it down to an iframe - Until that iframe finishes loading, the parent JS won't happen... Any idea ?

18:32  devinrolsen: :) happens
18:35  factorial: nm found it

18:37  devinrolsen: timmywil, its like I can't condition out that nested span in .account-full prior to .html() or text(), nor can I after. I just makes no sense.
18:37  timmywil: yup, regex remove it
18:37  timmywil: yea, thought i could work out a selector
18:38  timmywil: but you can select all the text, select the span text, then just remove it from the string
18:38  devinrolsen: but how do I regex something that has up to 15 diffrent combos of the nested span.
18:38  devinrolsen: that is going to be a huge regex
18:38  timmywil: doesn't even have to be regex
18:38  devinrolsen: ?
18:39  timmywil: var fullText = $('.account-full').text();  var spanText = $('.account-full').find('span').text();  fullText = fullText.replace(spanText, '')
18:40  devinrolsen: ah.
18:40  devinrolsen: not as bad as I was thinking.
18:40  timmywil: =)
18:44  factorial: can someone link me to the source for .resize() ?
18:45  factorial: i thought i had found it, but i hadn't.

18:51  link_: nope
18:51  JAAulde: mekwall: he wants current to slide out (to the right, I suppoe) as new slides in from left
18:52  mekwall: but that's not a tab
18:52  mekwall: that's a slider or accordion
18:53  JAAulde: yeah, agreed
18:53  JAAulde: *sigh*
18:54  JAAulde: we have what you might call a wizard...tabbed interface in a dialog

19:01  dorgan: right now I am doing $('#element').html(data.html)     data.html contains html content as well as <script> elements
19:02  Krambfhase: why would you load JavaScript via JSON?
19:02  mekwall: then you're screwed :)
19:02  dorgan: so there is no way to do this?
19:03  mekwall: dorgan: jQuery will eval script elements automatically

19:11  ngharo: EpiphanyG: you could bind a mousedown handler to toggle a flag
19:11  ngharo: and then a mouseover handler to toggle squares if flag is set
19:11  ngharo: then on mouseup, remove the flag
19:11  sehh: nobody knows? :P
19:11  EpiphanyG: bind the mousedown handler to the container rather than the individual pieces?
19:11  ScottO_: the slidedown seems to happen after the content is inserted into the element

19:22  timmywil: sehh: you're not going to find a plugin exactly like it, but you could probably adapt an existing one to make it look like it.  see ?g jquery accordian plugin
19:22  bot-t: sehh, Accordion | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/accordion
19:22  timmywil: find the closest
19:22  mekwall: woah... too many people here with fun problems
19:22  mekwall: wanna help u all
19:22  swiggy: mekwall,
19:22  swiggy: help me first
19:22  swiggy: should be fast
19:22  swiggy: just something dumb with my selector
19:22  EpiphanyG: was mine a fun one?
19:23  mekwall: this channel desperately needs a queuing system
19:23  mekwall: swiggy: that html gave me a headache
19:23  felcom: mekwall: are you going to publish the notification widget on your site any time soon?
19:24  mekwall: felcom: yup, during this weekend
19:24  EpiphanyG: ngharo: I use live when I'm dynamically creating whatever I'm binding the event to, saves me re-binding events
19:24  mekwall: felcom: but it's up on github already
19:24  mekwall: eh disregard that, didn't add it there yet
19:24  mekwall: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-tagging
19:24  mekwall: that one is on github :P
19:25  swiggy: yeah i know lol
19:25  swiggy: thats why i didnt want to give it to you
19:25  mekwall: swiggy: lemme check
19:25  jillianadriana: hey all! i'm a newbie here
19:25  mekwall: hey newbie!
19:25  mekwall: welcome :)
19:25  jillianadriana: i need some help
19:25  mekwall: ?ask @ jillianadriana
19:25  bot-t: jillianadriana, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
19:25  felcom: mekwall: sweet, i'll keep an eye out for it, already loading UI in my project so yours makes more sense to use
19:26  mekwall: felcom: also working on a ui form widget
19:26  jillianadriana: i was told to come here for help on twitter
19:26  mekwall: sure, go ahead
19:26  mekwall: we'll try and help
19:26  jillianadriana: ok
19:26  ngharo: EpiphanyG: ohhhh, i failed to realize that it works for FUTURE elements too
19:26  Hopsy: i need also help :(
19:26  ngharo: thx
19:26  ngharo: thats neat
19:26  EpiphanyG: :D
19:26  JAAulde: mekwall: http://www.panic.com/coda/ those tabs are what we want. Guess I can't use UI for that--time to get writing
19:26  EpiphanyG: saves a lot of headaches
19:26  jriggins: I'm a newbie too...thanks for the twitter post just now that mentioned this room...no questions just trolling for now :-)
19:26  Hopsy: but, i dont know what to ask
19:26  EpiphanyG: glad we could help each other :D
19:27  sehh: q: is it possible to make the jquery UI accordion horizontal instead of vertical?
19:27  mekwall: JAAulde: that's really just a slider with a couple of buttons above it :)
19:27 --- kanzure_1 is now known as kanzure
19:27  jillianadriana: i am very close to launching my personal portfolio website. i know very little about coding, so i payed someone to code my design for me... so i asked for a specific jquery gallery design and now i don't like it... i have no idea how to go about implementing a new gallery
19:27  Lumpio-: What advantage does using an accordion have over using tabs?
19:28  paul_irish: omg i heard w3schools is under attack!
19:28  JAAulde: mekwall: indeed...not that tabs or accordian are anything much different
19:28  Krambfhase: anonymous strikes again!
19:28  paul_irish: verbal assault!
19:28  mekwall: welcome paul_irish
19:28  paul_irish: hey bro
19:28  felcom: JAAulde: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/
19:28  EpiphanyG: nothing to do with w3fools I hope :P
19:28  mekwall: paul_irish: Stål needs to be in here so we can teach him what's right and wrong :)
19:28  falcom: who the heck is felcom
19:28  swiggy: $('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]').remove();            should remove    <select class="submenupos4"><option value="1">1</option><option value="2">2</option></select>     an option depending on what the value is passed to it right??
19:28  paul_irish: hahaha i know rite
19:28  sehh: Lumpio: I'm trying to create this effect, but I haven't found a good plugin: http://www.templatemonster.com/website-templates/24475.html
19:28  felcom: who the heck is falcom
19:28  swiggy: it shows up in console.log
19:28 * falcom detects an evil twin
19:28  swiggy: but it doesnt remove?!
19:29  backinnam: mekwall: sorry, had to step away.  I have a large application built without realizing this bug.  Should I override the fade function and implement removeAttr('filter')?
19:29 * falcom : falcom punch!
19:29  swiggy: console.log($('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]'));
19:29  mekwall: jillianadriana: that's quite a complex question
19:29  swiggy: is returing the right option
19:29  mekwall: backinnam: did you mean after or during fade?
19:29  jillianadriana: i know
19:29  JAAulde: felcom: thanks, will take a look. before I do, though, does this use UI tabs, or is it something else? I am quite sure I can write something, but was hoping since we were already using UI tabs() that I wouldn't have to
19:29  EpiphanyG: ngharo: any idea how to make it work on the first item you click too? http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/92bxa/6/
19:29  jillianadriana: so if anyone wants to skype, let me know
19:29  backinnam: during the fade the type is all screwy
19:29  mekwall: jillianadriana: not something that could be answered in a couple of minutes... why not let the same person fix it up to your liking?
19:30  jillianadriana: no offence or anything, but i need someone who speaks fluent english to help me
19:30  felcom: JAAulde: ah sorry missed that part, yeah this is from scratch. i'm sure you can just pull from the logic though and integrate into UI
19:30  EpiphanyG: w3schools taught me everything I knew about websites...!
19:30  backinnam: the elements disappear after the ui wrapper is removed also but I think that is a different problem
19:30  jillianadriana: i can't afford to pay them to  change it :(
19:30  mekwall: EpiphanyG: w3schools taught me everything I shouldn't
19:30  falcom: jillianadriana: why fluent english? because the previous guy didnt speak english well?
19:30  EpiphanyG: indeed :D I have since learnt the error of my ways
19:30  jillianadriana: yes
19:30  gsnedders: W3Schools taught me XHTML is HTML5.
19:31  JAAulde: felcom: ok. yeah, this thing is integrated into a wizard, so I had some custom hooks in the tab events and such. I can write a basic slider, but this needs some widgetesque stuff too--needs state and such.  Will look at what you linked, thanks
19:31  swiggy: plz someone?!
19:31  jillianadriana: we just had trouble communicating
19:31  mekwall: swiggy: i'm looking at it dude
19:31  falcom: jillianadriana: what changes must be done in the gallery? styling? behavior?
19:32  mekwall: swiggy: can't seem to get the click handler to fire at all
19:32  swiggy: click on the [x]
19:32  Lumpio-: sehh: The navigation is pretty awful... and that's pretty much all there is to it it seems
19:32  jillianadriana: mostly just styling
19:32  mekwall: ah
19:32  mekwall: swiggy: I see
19:32  swiggy: might need to put href="#" for JSFiddle
19:32  swiggy: im not sure
19:32  mekwall: swiggy: everything got removed properly
19:32  swiggy: no it doesnt
19:32  swiggy: look at the select
19:33  mekwall: swiggy: well, body is empty :)
19:33  mekwall: i clicked alll x
19:33  swiggy: lol
19:33  swiggy: do 1 at a time
19:33  swiggy: and take note of the # in the select
19:33  swiggy: when u remove it
19:33  jillianadriana: actually maybe a bit of behaviour
19:33  swiggy: the otehrs should be updated
19:33  swiggy: with the one removed
19:33  ngharo: EpiphanyG: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/92bxa/7/
19:33  jillianadriana: i don't think it's a huge change, i am just unsure of how to even begin trying to do it
19:33  EpiphanyG: ngharo, nice! what did you change?
19:33  falcom: jillianadriana: i can give a shot
19:34  paul_irish: is anyone skyping with jillian yet?
19:34  mekwall: swiggy: i think my brain might be too mashed to handle that code P
19:34  EpiphanyG: I'm not, should we be?
19:34  jillianadriana: no... jillian.adriana on skype if anyone wants to help
19:34  falcom: however i need to get lunch so if you cant find anyone by then i will be available
19:34  falcom: yea i heard she's hot
19:34  jillianadriana: ok
19:34  falcom: ;)
19:34  jillianadriana: i am hot
19:34  jillianadriana: haha
19:34  mekwall: haha
19:34  jriggins: lol
19:34  ngharo: EpiphanyG: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/92bxa/8/ just added a mousedown event to .griditem
19:34  swiggy: its not code
19:34  swiggy: its the selector
19:34  mekwall: now that's the kind of spirit we like in here jillianadriana
19:34  swiggy: there is something wrong with my selector
19:35  EpiphanyG: ah I see, thanks ngharo :)
19:35  jillianadriana: :)
19:35  mekwall: casual, relaxed :)
19:35  jillianadriana: so yea, jillian.adriana if anyone wants to give it a go
19:35  EpiphanyG: swiggy: where was the fiddle? I missed it, could you link it again
19:35  swiggy: [JSFIDDLE:: http://jsfiddle.net/chmode/DvHjB/] - [PROBLEM:: $('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]').remove();  ]              NO DOM errors, but its not removing the <option> either =( =(
19:35  swiggy: i am trying to removed all the <options>
19:36  swiggy: from multiple selects
19:36  swiggy: not remove ALL the option, remove the same option from all the selects
19:36  EpiphanyG: when you press what?
19:36  swiggy: [x]
19:36  jriggins: @member:jillianadriana just curious what's your timeline?
19:36  jriggins: oops
19:37  jillianadriana: whatever works for you :)
19:37  PrgmrBill: confirmed hot: http://www.myspace.com/jillianadriana
19:37  jillianadriana: i am flexible
19:37  mekwall: swiggy: sorry mate, that problem is just too complicated for me right now heh
19:37  jillianadriana: lolol that is sooo funny
19:37  jillianadriana: i don't use that anymore
19:37  paul_irish: PrgmrBill: you do a good service to maintaining the reputation of men on IRC
19:37  PrgmrBill: paul_irish: all in good fun :P
19:37  mekwall: PrgmrBill: haha
19:37  sehh: DAMN, i found the exact plugin I was looking for but its NOT for jquery :( its for mootools... damn
19:38  ajpiano: meh
19:38  swiggy: arg
19:38  falcom: she does have a cool name. first and last.
19:38  swiggy: ajpiano,
19:38  jriggins: confirmed :-)
19:38  swiggy: u always save me
19:38  swiggy: can u help?
19:38  swiggy: not remove ALL the option, remove the same option from all the selects
19:38  swiggy: [JSFIDDLE:: http://jsfiddle.net/chmode/DvHjB/] - [PROBLEM:: $('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]').remove();  ]              NO DOM errors, but its not removing the <option> either =( =(
19:38  EpiphanyG: swiggy, I'm looking now but I'm finding your code hard to read, no offence!
19:38  swiggy: yeah i bet
19:38  jillianadriana: may last name is actually dutch, so i use my middle name instead
19:38  jriggins: well if the experts on here don't have time to help...i'm curious but in the middle of my own work right now
19:39  mekwall: so who was next on my helping list?
19:39  EpiphanyG: swiggy: so clicking the first x should do what..? remove the 1/2/3/4/5 from the dropdown box?
19:39  Hopsy: mekwall: mee!
19:39  Hopsy: =d
19:39  swiggy: no
19:39  Hopsy: I amm
19:39  EpiphanyG: what should it do?
19:39  jillianadriana: http://www.mustlovepink.com/index2.html is my domain... using index2 just as a test...
19:39  ajpiano: swiggy: use linebrakes if you want people to help you
19:39  jillianadriana: take a look at what i have now
19:39  ajpiano: line breaks
19:40  swiggy: ok so if you click [X] on the first <li> it should remove '1' from all the selectbox's
19:40  mekwall: swiggy: one option?
19:40  jillianadriana: girly, i know
19:40  ajpiano: swiggy, your selection is clearly not matching anything, debug it
19:40  Krambfhase: swiggy: judging by the code you write you believe in the spaghetti monster?
19:40  swiggy: if you click [x] on the 3rd, it should remove <option value="3">3</option> from all the rest of the <select>'s
19:40  falcom: jillianadriana: isnt Love Pink a VS slogan?
19:40  swiggy: yes i do
19:40  EpiphanyG: that doesn't seem very intuitive :D
19:41  jillianadriana: i dont know... mine is MUST LOVE PINK
19:41  swiggy: no not 'one', the value="1"
19:41  swiggy: <option value="1">1</option>
19:41  swiggy: look at the selector
19:41  swiggy: its easy to follow
19:41  swiggy: and ajpiano
19:41  swiggy: it does match
19:41  swiggy: option value="1">1</option>
19:41  swiggy: <swiggy> look at the selector
19:41  swiggy: <swiggy> its easy to follow
19:41  ajpiano: bro town
19:41  swiggy: console.log($('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]'));
19:41  mekwall: Krambfhase++
19:41  swiggy: will return the the right values n sheet
19:41  mekwall: made my brain into spaghetti :(
19:42  swiggy: but $('.submenupos'+tabid+' option[value="'+value+'"]).remove(); doesnt remove it
19:42  ajpiano: swiggy, don't paste stuff that looks like this http://ajpiano.com/cap/f436d5.png and describe it as "easy to follow"
19:42  Hopsy: i have a thing that rotates photo's, when i pause and replay, it turns 2 times :(
19:42  EpiphanyG: indeed
19:42  swiggy: lolllllll
19:42  mekwall: ajpiano: haha
19:42  swiggy: its not the html
19:42  swiggy: the js is my problem
19:42  EpiphanyG: but there is js in the html
19:42  swiggy: here i will just ask
19:42  EpiphanyG: it's hard to see what's calling what
19:42  mekwall: well the js is manipulating the html :)
19:42  mekwall: so the html becomes a part of the problem
19:42  swiggy: how do i remove an option from a selectbox with the class of submenupos#?
19:42  ajpiano: select it an then remove it bro
19:42  Krambfhase: mekwall: :D
19:43  ajpiano: obviously something is wrong with your selector
19:43  swiggy: i dont know how
19:43  swiggy: bc
19:43  swiggy: console.log()
19:43  swiggy: returns it valid and all the right attributes
19:43  mekwall: Hopsy: sounds like that thing is broken )
19:43  ngharo: swiggy: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/DvHjB/1/
19:43  Hopsy: yess :(
19:43  swiggy: ty ngharo
19:44  jillianadriana: so instead of having the option of two additional photos for each piece, i want it just to be one big photo and then maybe i'll use numbers below the image to show if there are additional images... does that make sense?
19:44  mekwall: ngharo: hooray!
19:45  ngharo: i deciphered the code!
19:45  ngharo: lol
19:45  mekwall: jillianadriana: makes perfect sense
19:45  jillianadriana: ok good
19:45  jillianadriana: not all of my pieces have additional images
19:45  mekwall: jillianadriana: what blog engine do you use?
19:45  jillianadriana: so not all the image boxes can be filled
19:45  jillianadriana: ummm
19:45  EpiphanyG: wow, you get some sort of modal ngharo!
19:46  jillianadriana: i am not sure... it's not wordpress or anything...
19:46  timmywil: ngharo, swiggy, don't need the each http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/DvHjB/2/
19:46  EpiphanyG: that was some cool code obfuscating, and you beat it!
19:47  jillianadriana: mekwall: how do i find that out?
19:47  mekwall: jillianadriana: mind showing me? I can perhaps figure it out
19:48  jillianadriana: mekwall: sure, how exactly do i show you?
19:48  mekwall: you got a link to it?
19:48  jillianadriana: the website?
19:48  mekwall: yeah
19:48  mekwall: might be some info in the headers
19:48  jillianadriana: http://www.mustlovepink.com/index2.html
19:49  EpiphanyG: ngharo, I really appreciate your help with my fiddle earlier, cheers :)

19:54  halcyon1234: Does anyone have a list of all the jquery files/plugins that google hosts through ajax.googleapis.com?

19:56  JAAulde: when I upgraded from jQ 1.7.x to 1.8.x all my datepickers started initializing as visible in the DOM. Did a default option or init valuechange?
19:56  JAAulde: the upgrade path did not mention anything of that nature
19:57  Edler: can i have an event on the change of a value of an attribute
19:57  EpiphanyG: Edler: sounds like something a plugin might do
19:57  Edler: like if i have <div id="test" name="myName"> </div>
19:57  Edler: if the attr name changes .. can i have an event on that?
19:57  cburgdorf: mekwall: if you can owe me some minutes, give me a shout. I figured it all out and would like to share the weirdness with you ;-)
19:57  EpiphanyG: you could use setInterval to record what it should be and keep checking, but I don't think there's an event for it
19:57  EpiphanyG: I could be wrong though :D
19:57  mekwall: cburgdorf: got some time before jumping into the shower
19:57  cburgdorf: ok

19:58  mekwall: jillianadriana: can't really read anything out of a html file, need to see the real deal to look for any tags that might tell what's running behind the curtains
19:59  jillianadriana: i can give you full ftp access if you'd like
19:59  mekwall: jillianadriana: sure, but running short on time... tomorrow if you don't find anyone else to help you before that :)
19:59  cburgdorf: Ok, first...there is no simple way atm to drag an element which might be removed from the DOM while you drag it. Even if you use a clone for dragging. But you can work around it
20:00  jillianadriana: ok, absolutely. whenever works for you
20:00  jillianadriana: do you have an email i can keep in touch with?
20:00  mekwall: cburgdorf: you aren't supposed to do that :)
20:00  cburgdorf: oh yes you are
20:00  cburgdorf: think of a live table with data rushing in and out
20:00  mekwall: jillianadriana: mekwall@writeless.se should work just fine
20:00  cburgdorf: and you take a row to drop it elsewhere
20:00  jillianadriana: mekwall: thank you x1 million
20:01  mekwall: jillianadriana: don't cry wolf :D
20:01  cburgdorf: however, u can fix it with nested droppables
20:01  mekwall: jillianadriana: or however you say it, the other way around haha
20:01  Nomikos: !visible
20:01 * Nomikos grmbls
20:01  jillianadriana: mekwall: i got ya
20:01  cburgdorf: but when you use nested droppables there is one thing to keep in mind
20:02  jillianadriana: i just need to get my site up and running already
20:02  mekwall: cburgdorf: well, remove it when it drops, not when you start dragging?
20:02  jillianadriana: my mom keeps asking why it's taking so long haha
20:02  cburgdorf: exactly!
20:02  cburgdorf: but still some trickyness
20:03  mekwall: jillianadriana: moms...
20:03  cburgdorf: if u drop the the item somewhere where it wasnt supposed to be dropped it, there wont be a drop event to clean that up
20:03  jillianadriana: mewall: oh i know...
20:03  cburgdorf: u can fix that with an outter droppable that catches all and cleanes it up...
20:03  cburgdorf: but, STILL some trickyness in it
20:03  jillianadriana: i made a poor decision and used some of my student loan money to pay for the website, so my mom and dad want me to get it up and running asap so it wasn't a waste haha
20:03  cburgdorf: (hold your breath, jsFiddle coming right soon) ;-)
20:04  mekwall: cburgdorf: to me it sounds as if you are making this more complicated then it really is :)
20:04  cburgdorf: the drop event gets captured by the droppable that was first instanceinated not the one that lays deeper in DOM level
20:05  jillianadriana: mekwall: i will email you my ftp info
20:05  mekwall: I get it, but I'm sure there's a better way to do it

20:05  _Hace_: :)
20:05  cburgdorf: change the order of foo and bar and it wont work
20:05  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: looks quite nice, your page!
20:05  mekwall: jillianadriana: shoot
20:05  jillianadriana: thanks!! :D
20:05  cburgdorf: if you know a better way to achieve it Im willing to listen ;-)
20:06  cburgdorf: the red square demonstrates it
20:07  jillianadriana: Krambfhase: my background image didn't turn out right though :(
20:07  k1t: Krambfhase: it is for no conflict mode
20:07  Danielpk: i using $('element').append(html); then i try to $('element').scrollTo('id#content-inserted', 1500); but scroll dont work, how i can make it work?
20:07  k1t: Kaapa: but even when I make it just $() i still have the same issue
20:08  cburgdorf: for me, the bug is, if u use "helper: clone" the helper element should not freeze where it is just because the original element was removed.
20:08  cburgdorf: thats the actual bug if u ask me
20:08  k1t: oops, I tabbed to the wrong person on that second one
20:08  Krambfhase: k1t dunno :|
20:08  k1t: };
20:08  k1t: thanks anyways
20:08  k1t: :p i will figure it out.. i had it working, but broke it
20:08  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: looks ok to me.
20:09  Krambfhase: never change a running system!
20:09  jillianadriana: yea but it's not the image i asked for... i mean, it is... but it was edited!!
20:09  jillianadriana: they mirrored it or something
20:10  mekwall: cburgdorf: you want them to stay in the drop, right?
20:11  cburgdorf: nope, it should dissapear
20:11  cburgdorf: after it was dropped
20:11  cburgdorf: no matter if the original element is still there or not, it might has gone in between
20:11 --- c4rl is now known as c4rl-afk
20:12 --- irfaN__ is now known as irfaN
20:12  cburgdorf: I should remove the blue one from this fiddle...that has actually no meaning
20:12  mekwall: cburgdorf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/vuhBw/1/
20:12  mekwall: doesn't that do what you want?
20:13  cburgdorf: nope
20:13  mekwall: then I don't understand what you are trying to achieve
20:13  cburgdorf: the thing is, the original element #red might has been removed from the dom while you drag it
20:13  cburgdorf: thats why I simulate that on dragstart
20:14  jillianadriana: Krambfhase: what i asked for: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/JillianVW/bg.gif vs. what i got: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/JillianVW/bg-body.gif
20:14  mekwall: cburgdorf: well, that doesn't really matter
20:14  EpiphanyG: Edler, still there?
20:15  cburgdorf: what is disableSelection supposed to do?
20:16  EpiphanyG: Edler: does this do what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/EpiphanyG/XNwra/2/
20:16  cburgdorf: I think your example wont work if #red has been removed while you drag it
20:16  mekwall: cburgdorf: ofc it does?
20:16  Cryp71c: can I change .css() changes onto each other? .css('height', '200px').css('width', '20px'); or somehow otherwise condense multiple calls on the same selector for changing css values?
20:16  mekwall: cburgdorf: you are dragging the helper
20:17 --- danheberden is now known as danheberden|away
20:17  mekwall: cburgdorf: disableSelection just disables selection ;)
20:17  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: well, close enough.
20:17  jillianadriana: Krambfhase: not to me :P
20:17  cburgdorf: can u build in a simulation of removing the element while you drag it as I did?
20:17  Krambfhase: Cryp71c: http://api.jquery.com/css#css2
20:17  mekwall: sure
20:18  cburgdorf: from what I spotted, no matter if its only a helper, if you remove the original element in between, the helper will stay and freeze
20:18  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: why dont you tell em that?
20:18  jillianadriana: do you think i can still ask them to change it?
20:18 --- d0m^^ is now known as d0m
20:18  cmerlo441: can anyone answer a really bizarre jqueryui question for me?
20:19  mekwall: cburgdorf: if you drag the element while it gets removed, do you want the dragging to continue or just dissapear as well?
20:19  cmerlo441: i've never seen this before, but calling $.dialog() creates a dialog box with a *huge* title bar
20:19  cmerlo441: like, 100 px high
20:19  cburgdorf: to continue
20:19  cmerlo441: when i resize it, then the title bar resets itself
20:20  JAAulde: cmerlo441: we just had the same issue when upgrading from 1.7.x to 1.8.x. It was an issue with our custom CSS for the dialogs
20:20  cmerlo441: oh, good, glad it's a known issue
20:20  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: well, if your contract says that you want that image as the background you can complain.
20:20  JAAulde: our designer fixed his CSS and all was well
20:20  jillianadriana: hmmm ok
20:20  cmerlo441: i don't have any custom css for the jqueryui stuff, though
20:21  JAAulde: cmerlo441: did you just recently upgrade UI?
20:21  cmerlo441: it's 1.8.4
20:21  mekwall: cburgdorf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/vuhBw/2/
20:21  mekwall: there it is
20:21  maxli: $j("#process-box2").clcik(function(){
20:21  maxli: 		$j(".services-content div.holder").animate({"left": "-=790px"}, "slow");
20:21  maxli: 		
20:21  maxli: 	});
20:21  Krambfhase: jillianadriana: or you can ask someelse to help you change that.
20:21  cmerlo441: the weird thing is that other code in this very codebase doesn't do that
20:21  cmerlo441: only this one page
20:21  maxli: anyone know how do stop second click?
20:21  EpiphanyG: Edler: does this do what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/EpiphanyG/XNwra/2/
20:21  jillianadriana: ok... does anyone else know how to change my background?
20:21  JAAulde: cmerlo441: not sure what to tell you. i can only relay what happened here
20:21  cmerlo441: and no, i didn't upgrade recently
20:21  cmerlo441: ok, thanks
20:22  mekwall: cburgdorf: after you start dragging it will remove the element after 2 seconds
20:22  cburgdorf: here u are it freezes anywhere if you just dont drop it on the droppable
20:22  mekwall: regardless of what you do
20:22  cmerlo441: i will try to upgrade to 1.8.8 and see if it happens again
20:22  cburgdorf: just drop it elsewhere and u will see how it freezes
20:22  mekwall: cburgdorf: not here?
20:22  mekwall: it reverts just fine
20:23  mekwall: ff?
20:23  cburgdorf: grab it, move it for some seconds and than drop it elsewhere but not on the droppable (chrome)
20:23  cburgdorf: its not reverting for me
20:23  mekwall: well, then its removed
20:23  maxli: first click for .animation does a move from left to right how to prevent second click which move to further left??
20:23  cburgdorf: should I make a screencast *G
20:23  mekwall: ah I see
20:24  jillianadriana: is there a css chat or html chat where i can ask for help with my background image?
20:24  Caraes_Naur__: #html, #css
20:24  cburgdorf: yes, its removed but the helper still freezes just there where it is
20:25  maxli: anyone hlep me?? first click for .animation does a move from left to right how to prevent second click which move to further left??
20:25  EpiphanyG: maxli: add an if? (if it's already left, don't bother)?
20:26  jillianadriana: alrighty, i may be back
20:26  cburgdorf: u see what I mean?
20:26  Caraes_Naur__: or if the animation is active
20:26  maxli: oya.
20:26  maxli: lol. thanks eplphanG
20:26  queso: How do I select an element by name?  For example, <input type="hidden" name="person_id"/> ?
20:26  EpiphanyG: you're welcome :)
20:26  Joikus: why wont this get rid of my span? $('#symbol_' + symbol).remove();    the html is: <span id="symbol_^IXIC">Nasdaq <a href="#" onclick="CustomWidgets.RemoveSymbol('^IXIC')">Remove</a></span>
20:26  Krambfhase: maxli: or .unbind()
20:27  timmywil: queso: $('input[name=person_id]')
20:27  maxli: how do i use unbind?
20:27  queso: timmywil: ty
20:27  timmywil: maxli, see ?unbind

20:27  Krambfhase: ?unbind @ maxli
20:27  Krambfhase: :)
20:28  maxli: how to show you guys my code?/
20:28  cburgdorf: mekwall: did you see what I mean?
20:28  timmywil: joikus, your selector must be off
20:28  Krambfhase: ?paste @ maxli
20:28  mekwall: cburgdorf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/vuhBw/3/
20:28  bot-t: maxli, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
20:28  mekwall: solved
20:28  mekwall: cburgdorf: just bind mouseup on the helper
20:28  mekwall: and remove it
20:28  cburgdorf: wooot
20:28  mekwall: actually
20:28  cburgdorf: thats cool!
20:28  Cork[home]: Joikus: try escape the ^ with \^
20:28  Joikus: timmywil: I did alert ('#symbol_' + symbol) and it is identical
20:29  mekwall: cburgdorf: well, I told you there was an easier way heh
20:29  maxli: http://jsfiddle.net/UNkw4/
20:29  timmywil: maybe what cork said then
20:29  maxli: how do i use unbind for the second click to prevent the div animate further?

20:30  Krambfhase: maxli: http://jsfiddle.net/UNkw4/1/
20:30  cburgdorf: yes, you are right, this seems to be a better way to handle it because you wont need any nested droppables at all
20:30  Joikus: \^ worked timmy
20:30  Joikus: hmm
20:30  Joikus: they don't all have a ^ though
20:31  timmywil: ?
20:31  cburgdorf: jette tak ;-)
20:31  timmywil: your id does
20:31  Joikus: $('#symbol_\\' + symbol).remove();  this workedf
20:31  ngharo: maxlim, Krambfhase: or use .one('click', fn)
20:31  Joikus: but symbol could could and could not have ^
20:31  Blazento: how would you make a radio button / input field not selectable instead of just hiding it? and making it grayed out?
20:31  Back2Basics: can you have form buttons outside the form tags that affect the form?
20:32  maxli: thanks guys
20:32  Krambfhase: ngharo: oh yeah, i always forget about that one.
20:32  mekwall: cburgdorf: hehe yw
20:33  Joikus: timmywil you know what I mean? in this case my id was symbol_^ixic, but sometimes it's symbol_goog
20:33  EpiphanyG: Blazento: $('radio_button').attr('disabled','disabled') ?
20:34  timmywil: blazento, or readonly
20:34  timmywil: and css to grey it
20:35  Blazento: awesome, thanks guys!

20:40  letsgojuno: is there a refresh function for a draggable list using jQueryUI?
20:41  timmywil: letsgojuno, there is not
20:41  timmywil: call again for new elements
20:43  letsgojuno: not sure what you mean timmywil
20:43  letsgojuno: how would i do that
20:43  jdolan: hi, is it possible to use jQuery selectors to find non-standard elements that look like <?SOME-CUSTOM-GARBAGE attribute="foo"?>   ?
20:43  letsgojuno: im append an element back to a list but its not draggable
20:43  jdolan: i've tried $('\\?SOME-CUSTOM-GARBAGE') and it doesn't work :/
20:46  timmywil: letsgojuno, ah to the same list, ok, you may have to call draggable on the list again
20:46  timmywil: letsgojuno: or, instead of using remove for whatever you're putting back see ?detach
20:46  bot-t: letsgojuno, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
20:47  timmywil: will keep it's data and should continue working with draggable
20:47  letsgojuno: ill look into it thanks.
20:49  timmywil: jdolan: you could select by the attribute $('[attribute=foo]'), but selecting by the tag name should work as well
20:49  Joikus: what am I doing wrong here? $.each($('.index'), function(i) {...
20:49  Back2Basics: or put an id in there jdolan
20:49  Joikus: I have a bunch of <span class="index"
20:49  ajpiano: Joikus, $(".index").each
20:51  Joikus: $('.index').each(function(i) { alert(i) }); didn't work
20:51  Joikus: oh
20:51  Joikus:  <span class="undefined"
20:51  Joikus: something broke there, my bad
20:52  ajpiano: that is how you're meant to iterate over a jquery object though
20:52  ajpiano: when the way that is supposed to work doesn't work, it means you have to figure out why it isn't working, not just rry some random shit
20:52  timmywil: he got it aj

21:22  eirikb: Gent: You can use ajax
21:22  eirikb: Gent: $.ajjax and beforeSend or something, then add them to xhr object
21:23  Cork[home]: Gent: getJSON sends accept header for application/json so yes
21:23  Gent: Cork[home]: thank you
21:23  Cork[home]: (same as $.ajax({ dataType: 'json' });
21:24  Gent: Cork[home]: yes, I didn't know if that was only used internally for how to parse it or if it actually sent appropriate headers
21:24  Cork[home]: it sends two headers
21:24  Cork[home]: application/json and application/javascript
21:25  Cork[home]: javascript as a fallback for servers that doesn't know json

21:43  Newcomer: Hello, I dont know where to start but to learn jQuery do I need to learn JavaScript first? can I dive in directly to jQuery?
21:43  ajpiano: morovan: it looks like you're running into some really ugly sticky territory with IE's type rendering
21:44  Newcomer: I do have some basic programming skills like c, c# etc
21:44  ajpiano: it looks ok in chrome
21:44  ajpiano: Newcomer: it helps to at least dive into them both at the same time
21:44  ajpiano: otherwise you won't really understand how jquery is doing what it's doing or if your code has bad tendencies
21:44  morovan: Thanks ajpiano, any suggestions to remedy?

21:45  ajpiano: Newcomer: yeah
21:45  ajpiano: Newcomer: i acutall yhave something really good for you to watch
21:45  ajpiano: if you say you have general programming experieence
21:45  Newcomer: Thank you ajpiano:
21:46  ajpiano: Newcomer http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-talk-at-northeastern/
21:46  Newcomer: Yes I have general basic programming skills and familiar with tid bits
21:46  Newcomer: let me see..
21:46  morovan: Perhaps I could remove the opacity, and just have it swap directly?
21:47  Newcomer: ajpiano is it lectures series?
21:47  ajpiano: morovan: the page i sent says you can just set an explicit background color, but i've not tested it myself... taking out the fade effedct would also solve the problem

21:47  ajpiano: Newcomer: it's just one video by the creator jquery explaining javascript concepts to a CS class
21:47  ajpiano: it was pretty useful for me once upon a time
21:47  Newcomer: hmmm... good stuff for this weekend then.
21:47  a_L_p_: with taht code it just acknowledges when the option changes, not the value it has.
21:47  ajpiano: Newcomer: there are also some  good videos on the YUI theatre that were really helpful when i got started
21:47  a_L_p_: any one have any suggestions how I might fix this?
21:48  Newcomer: I'll start from this video . The First ever step to leanr jQuery! :)
21:48  ajpiano: a_L_p_: you need to check teh value of the option
21:48  ajpiano: a_L_p_, everytime you do $("ANYTHING") it returns a jQuery object
21:48  morovan: ajpiano, I think you sent me my page back again
21:48  ajpiano: which always returns true

21:49  ajpiano: a_L_p_, you can do $(this).val() inside of the change handler
21:49  ajpiano: to get the value of the currently selected optoin
21:49  a_L_p_: ajpiano: thanks, I will give that a try
21:50  swiggy: anyone have any recommendations for a jquery menu plugin/solution?
21:50  joshsmith: I have two different submits for a form (name="save" and name="launch"). Can I bind to those submits separately?
21:50  joshsmith: without binding to a click or something instead
21:51  swiggy: .submit(function() { });
21:51  swiggy: ?submit
21:51  bot-t: .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
21:51  swiggy: $(form1).submit
21:52  joshsmith: swiggy: but the point is that they're the same form
21:52  morovan: ajpiano, I set a bgcolor on that element and that fixed it!  Thank you so much, do you have a wishlist somewhere?
21:52  joshsmith: swiggy: but with two different submits
21:52  ajpiano: morovan: um, buyyourfriendadrink.com
21:53  joshsmith: so on the backend you'd handle them differently
21:53  swiggy: so you want one to submit and then the other after?
21:53  swiggy: or both submit at the same time?
21:53  joshsmith: I want to bind the handler to just one of them
21:53  joshsmith: I need to do jQuery validation on the name="launch" submit event
21:54  joshsmith: but not on the name="save" event
21:54  morovan: ok, give me your details so I can :)
