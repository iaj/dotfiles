00:03  bellHead: What needs to loaded first so that "$(document).ready(..." will work? I'm getting "$ is not a function".
00:04  sheepz: jquery.js perhaps?:P
00:05  bellHead: It's in the page, and it's above the file giving the error ...
00:08  sheepz: bellHead: have you checked with firebug if it's acutally loaded?
00:14  bellHead: sheepz: It seems to be. Net panel reports it retrieved 300ms before the file I try to use it in, so it's not a race condition ...
00:14  bellHead: Is $(document).ready( the correct way to add on onload event?
00:18  sheepz: well, yes
00:18  BasementJack-C: Does anyone know of a jquery based reporting engine?
00:19  sheepz: bellHead: what do you mean by onload? document.ready means that the dom has loaded
00:19  sheepz: onload is afaik when everything is loaded
00:21  bellHead: sheepz: When the dom has loaded is fine. When I can start addressing elements and know they're all there.
00:22  OhaiBBQ: define "there"
00:24  BasementJack-C: bellHead: Yeah, for the most part $(document).ready is what you want - that is when the page is loaded, but could be before images have been pulled from the server.
00:25  dabear: avoid putting coding in document ready
00:25  dabear: put your code just before </body>
00:25  dabear: and you will have direct access to all elements in the page
00:28  bellHead: I'm still left with the problem of why $(document) is not playing nicely ...
00:30  darcyclarke: bellHead whats the issue?
00:30  bellHead: darcyclarke: jquery.js is loading, and in another file loaded a few 100 ms later I get "$ is not an object" error.
00:30  Aliv3: hi
00:32  darcyclarke: bellHead you're loading a file and trying to run the js in it?
00:33  darcyclarke: bellHead any chance you can throw up an example of what your trying to achieve on jsfiddle.net
00:33  darcyclarke: a test case would be good
00:34 --- kylehayes_ is now known as kylehayes
00:37  bellHead: darcyclarke: http://jsfiddle.net/4ZmaB/ is the content of the second file. It's really simple. Just looks like I'm not getting jquery.js loaded.
00:39  darcyclarke: seems to be working in jsfiddle.net...
00:39  razieliyo: how can I select all the other objects but not THIS?
00:40  dabear: .not(this)
00:40  razieliyo: nice, and can I do it inside ""?, so, $("ul.item:not(this)")?
00:40  dabear: var $all = $(".foo"); $all.each( function(){   var $notThis = $all.not(this);  })
00:40  Dreamer3__: fun
00:40  dabear: nope
00:40  dabear: not inside a selector
00:40  razieliyo: oh, ok
00:41  dabear: that wouldn't make sense either
00:41  razieliyo: I just want to apply something to all the objects that are not this
00:41  razieliyo: I'll try with not(this)
00:41  dabear: all objects?
00:41  dabear: define that
00:42  razieliyo: I mean, ul, li, a, p
00:42  razieliyo: does this make sense? $('ul.item').not(this)
00:42  razieliyo: to apply something to all the ul.items that are not the one that I'm clicking at
00:43  razieliyo: I'll try
00:43  dabear: that would select al ul's but not this
00:43  razieliyo: nice
00:43  razieliyo: I think that's what I want
00:43 * gothm0g leaves
00:43  dabear: razieliyo: avoid selecting elements again and again
00:44  Aliv3: canyou do cookies in javascript/jquery

00:45  razieliyo: I see, that seems simpler
00:45  razieliyo: that what I was doing
00:46  dabear: razieliyo: this is how you SHOULD NOT do it:  $('ul.item').click(function(){   var $otherULs = $('ul.item').not(this); }  )
00:47  razieliyo: so... how would yo do it?
00:47  dabear: ( the last one selects all elements both initially and again on every click)
00:47  dabear: like the first one
00:47  dabear: notice they are different
00:47  razieliyo: oh, ok ok
00:47  razieliyo: I thought they were
00:48  razieliyo: the same
00:48  razieliyo: but not, I'll try this
00:48  dabear: did you read?
00:48  razieliyo: yes yes
00:48  razieliyo: I understand
00:48  razieliyo: sorry, here at spain it's a bit late and my eyes are getting down

01:00  lxsameer: hi is there any tool for minimizing javascript code, just like jquery mini ?
01:01  dabear: lxsameer: there are several. yui minifier was used by jquery earlier. google closure compiler is used now
01:04  coldhead: lxsameer: or you can just shorten your variable names and remove inessential whitespace

03:10  shipit: hi all, from an evt.currentTarget, how can I select an <img> child node?

03:16  shipit: TNorris: thx! I'm trying ...
03:16  TNorris: np
03:16  BenjiBee072: Pilate, do you have any ideas about what I might be missing?
03:20  amereservant: BenjiBee072: What's not working?
03:21  BenjiBee072: amereservant: Sorry, I updated the fiddle with comments to indicate that: http://jsfiddle.net/CAqhy/1/
03:22  BenjiBee072: I'm getting both the title and the description and using my function for one and the code outright for the other. One works, the other doesn't.
03:22  jrockjiggz: FUUUUU
03:23  amereservant: BenjiBee072: Well you're providing a callback function when calling it and there's no parameter for a callback function.
03:23  jrockjiggz: I have 3 basic php if statements generating jscript, if I take the 1st one, it and duplicate it once, it works, if I duplicate it a 3rd time, js breaks
03:24  amereservant: BenjiBee072: When you declare your function getFlickr, you only provide two possible parameters...
03:24  amereservant: BenjiBee072: When you call it, you're adding a third parameter, function(data){} and that's invalid.
03:25  imakewebthings: ^ is basically right
03:25  amereservant: imakewebthings: Hehe, there's more than that wrong with it, but that's a good place to start.
03:25  BenjiBee072: amereservant: Hmm, okay. I guess I thought that was taken care of by using return(data).
03:25  imakewebthings: amereservant word
03:26  imakewebthings: BenjiBee072 data is not defined within the scope of your function
03:26  BenjiBee072: I know, the code isn't great, but I am about a week into jQuery and Javascript, heh.
03:26  amereservant: BenjiBee072: No problem, you need to read on variable scope and do a little tinkering with that.
03:26  jrockjiggz: semicolons.......
03:27  BenjiBee072: Okay, so I should define a third parameter: data, is that correct?
03:27  amereservant: imakewebthings: The best thing that helped me with learning jQuery functions was http://www.authenticsociety.com/blog/jQueryPluginTutorial_Beginner
03:27  imakewebthings: BenjiBee072 http://jsfiddle.net/CAqhy/2/
03:27  amereservant: BenjiBee072: ^^
03:27  amereservant: Wrong person.
03:27  imakewebthings: lol
03:28  imakewebthings: i took your function and added a third parameter, a function to pass to getJSON
03:28  amereservant: BenjiBee072: The title is a little misleading as far as the content of that page goes, but it does a great job at explaining functions and the scope of variables.
03:28  BenjiBee072: imakewebthings: Hah, so just a comma and "fn", I love it.
03:29  imakewebthings: BenjiBee072 the length of the syntax isn't important, knowing how to pass functions around as variables is key
03:29  BenjiBee072: I'm getting there, don't worry. I think I need to read up more on JS instead of relying on jQuery.
03:31  dilvie: BenjiBee072: jQuery is not another language. If you're using jQuery, you're coding in JS.
03:32  BenjiBee072: dilvie: Yes, I understand that, of course. But it's such an extensive library that if you get into jQuery without any pure Javascript knowledge you pretty much learn a jQuery specific lanuage.
03:32  BenjiBee072: I feel jQuery would make much more sense to me if I had been coming up with solutions from scratch in pure JS before the advent of jQuery.
03:33  BenjiBee072: imakewebthings: Now that my code is working, I'm curious.. how else would you change my approach?
03:34  imakewebthings: hold on phone
03:34  amereservant: I learned jQuery first and because of it, I better understand Javascript and see how nice jQuery really is compared to it's parent language.
03:35  BenjiBee072: amereservant: I suppose there is that, too. jQuery would allow you to immeadiatly see a really tangible value in the language.
03:35  dilvie: BenjiBee072: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742  <-- read that.
03:36  amereservant: $('#selected span') is MUCH easier than document.querySelector("#selected span")
03:36  amereservant: And I can use that same syntax to select an element by id too.
03:36  dilvie: BenjiBee072: Honestly, learning jQuery first is probably the best way to learn good JavaScript. Most tutorials and JavaScript books teach really lousy practices.
03:37  dilvie: jQuery is good JS
03:38  dilvie: jQuery and Node.JS are beacons of hope in a sea of crappy code. =)

03:39  BenjiBee072: amereservant: Ihad a feeling someone would mention that. My actualy code uses an ID, that was laziness on my part for the fiddle.
03:40  BenjiBee072: dilvie: That was exactly what I'm  looking for. I've started out with some terrible books that put me off toother languages before.

04:17  muley: lol ya, just.. "when it's ready"
04:18  muley: alright just curious

04:48  imakewebthings: but yea go to town
04:48  imakewebthings: have fun
04:48  interopcop: (code doesn't work btw)
04:48  josephoenix: I heard <a href="javascript:foo('bar');"> was the wrong way to make a link that triggers some javascript
04:48  imakewebthings: im confident the code is doing exactly what it should ;)
04:48  interopcop: probably missing some closing brace or something
04:48  josephoenix: What's the right way?
04:49  imakewebthings: oh, yea ha i def am just spitting the idea

04:49  dilvie: josephoenix: There are several right ways.
04:50  josephoenix: Where can I read about them?
04:50  dilvie: if there are lots of elements, or you need to attach events to elements that may not exist or be ready to manipulate, use .delegate()
04:52  josephoenix: Okay, well what would be best in my case? What I'm doing now is having a list of items, each one with a link that triggers javascript to add it to another list
04:53  josephoenix: This was easy with javascript: links, because I could generate the link on the server and include the identifier the javascript expects
04:55 @ajpiano: why would you need to pass the identifier to each element on a one to one basis?
04:56 @ajpiano: $("#yourul li").click(function(e) { $(this).appendTo("#someOtherUL");   });
04:56  josephoenix: okay, well I lied :] It's not as simple as moving <li>s around
04:56 @ajpiano: it never is
04:57 @ajpiano: if you need to pass cutom server generated data to elements
04:57 @ajpiano: you should look into using html5 data attributes
04:57  imakewebthings: mmmmmm data-*
04:58  destinydriven: I posted this earlier . . . I need a better way of handling the way rows are updated in this table on edit. My current code works if only table row is edited but I'm getting issues with subsequent edits http://www.jsfiddle.net/unwej/4/ live example is here http://msea.commerce.gov.lc/admin/baseline_data_records/edit/4
04:58  josephoenix: mm data
04:58  josephoenix: looks useful
04:58  Aliv3: knock knock anyone home
04:58  josephoenix: But how widely supported?
04:58 @ajpiano: works everywhere
04:59 @ajpiano: jquery consumes the data in them automatically in jquery 1.4.3
04:59  imakewebthings: josephoenix what the heck does "supported" mean in terms of data atts
04:59 @ajpiano: imakewebthings: "
04:59 @ajpiano: it means "i am vaguely scared of this,being unfamiliar with it"
04:59  sohail: anyone here use the qtip plugin?
04:59  imakewebthings: ah
04:59  imakewebthings: anyway
05:00  imakewebthings: <section your-mom="inmybed"></section>
05:00  josephoenix: ajpiano: it means: will jquery be able to read data attributes in older browsers?
05:00  imakewebthings: it wont validate but i can totally use that attribute
05:00  sohail: I want to display the qtip (on another element) depending on the contents ofa nother element
05:00 @ajpiano: yes,it's an attribute
05:00  imakewebthings: $('section').attr('your-mom');   // "inmybed"
05:01  imakewebthings: but what ajpiano said, jQ is nice in that it looks for data-* atts and gives them to .data

05:09  iszak: or create a local script to poll the remote script.

05:44  Superman_: do you google it?
05:44  Superman_: I think there are plenty of plugins out there
05:44  destinydriven: yeah, google got me that one but its ooooold
05:45  Superman_: okay let me check my bookmarks
05:47  Superman_: destinydriven the easiest solution to this
05:47  Superman_: is make your own controls
05:47  Superman_: and enter data through them
05:47  Superman_: and table sorter will read it back
05:48  destinydriven: I tried something like this with ui dialog and I got stuck

06:16 @ajpiano: the real question is why do you need such an old plugin

06:21  teolicy: Hi. I'm new to web programming. I'd like to do an ajax POST request, and I was surprised by the API of $.post(), namely, I'd expect my callback to receive a 'status' and 'data' parameters, and handle errors if status != 200, orsomething like that.
06:22  temp01: teolicy: if you want to handle errors, use $.ajax with success and error callbacks
06:22  teolicy: I saw in my colleague's code the use of asyncPOST (notice no $ at the beginning), which seems to have the API I want but (a) doesn't work and (b) ...
06:22  teolicy: Oh.
06:22  teolicy: Great! :)
06:23  teolicy: I guess I was taken back by the label "low level interface", I was thinking "gee, it can't be right that I'll be using THAT already..."
06:23  Taar779: Hello everyone
06:24 @ajpiano: $.post and $.get etc are just shortcuts to $.ajax
06:24 @ajpiano: you should use $.ajax if you need to

06:27  teolicy: temp01: $.ajax is precisely what I wanted, thanks mate.
06:28  coldhead: good on ya mate
06:28  b0x: too right gov
06:28  teolicy: coldhead: I assume you were cynical, but let me tell you that I find Windows 7 so complex and scary while I find a nice vintage 1998 Debian rather simple.
06:29  destinydriven: ajpiano: SlickGrid looks hot, gonna give it a go
06:29 @ajpiano: destinydriven: woot! glad i was able to persuade you
06:30  teolicy: Pardon the rant here, but what's the use of $.post and $.get? Why would anyone want to use an 'easy' API that /doesn't let you check for an error condition/? (well, except with a complex and scary global event... :)
06:30  MagusOTB: Dumb question: What's the CSS selector for an element that is a member of class A and class B?
06:30  coldhead: teolicy: oh i'm too good natured to be cynical

06:30 @ajpiano: teolicy: they're convenient for ppl with simple use cases
06:30  coldhead: keep your use cases simple, people!

06:31  MagusOTB: ajpiano: Awesome, thanks
06:31 @ajpiano: coldhead: and your rectums tightly clenched
06:31  coldhead: way ahead of you
06:32  teolicy: ajpiano: Yes, I'm always making sure it's tight as a fist. But that doesn't mean I don't check for an error condition... what's the point in doing an operation (a network operation!) if you don't care if it succeeds? It's not that I blame the simple people... errr, the people with simple use cases, I just wonder why would you give your users an API which is likely to shoot them in the foot.
06:32 @ajpiano: coldhead: too late i'm already in bro
06:32  teolicy: Well, whatever, the deadline is looming to near for this kind of discussion :)
06:32 @ajpiano: teolicy: there are other ways to handle errors in ajax besides explicitly a header in the 400 range
06:33  teolicy: ajpiano: Ah. Yes, that's a very good point.
06:33 @ajpiano: like, what if it's an error from your application you want to return, you could still have a success handler, and then tell the user something bad happened
06:33  coldhead: if my POST handling URL has gone away whether my AJAX correctly reports it is way down my list of problems
06:34  teolicy: ajpiano: Yes yes. Well, the only thing I can say is that this is probably not what the Gods of HTTP intended, but, alas, I think the Gods of HTTP didn't intend many things.
06:34  coldhead: the gods of HTTP were cunts
06:34  coldhead: there i said it
06:34 @ajpiano: teolicy: there's a big differece between "file not found" and "that username is already taken"
06:35  coldhead: ah good old http status 604: username is already taken
06:36  teolicy: ajpiano: I thought I should use HttpForbidden in mostly all error cases, i.e., "I understood what you're trying to do, but I'll not allow it".
06:36  teolicy: ajpiano: Within it you can send a nice message explaining why (username is too gay for me to let 'puppyDollz<3' on my system)
06:37  teolicy: (just, for example, you know)
06:37 @ajpiano: not everyone does that

06:50  josephoenix: Randy__: I believe you can get the webkit inspector by right clicking on an element and choosing 'inspect element'
06:50  temp01: you can access them using .data()
06:50  josephoenix: then you can just switch to the console tab
06:50  josephoenix: works in Chrome for mac

07:18  teolicy: Suppose I have a JSON string, how should I deserialize it?
07:19  teolicy: (i.e., not with eval)
07:19  teolicy: $.parseJSON(), never mind.
07:21 --- BarbaraWalters is now known as SlexAxton
07:21  MagusOTB: Out of curiosity, why is eval(jsonstring) considered such a bad idea anyway?
07:21  coldhead: its mostly superstition, MagusOTB
07:21  coldhead: eval SOUNDS evil
07:22  coldhead: its like how 13 is considered unlucky
07:23  rimantas: if you get your 13 from site you don't control it may as well be unlucky
07:24  temp01: teolicy: $.ajax has a dataType option, you should specify json as value
07:25  teolicy: temp01: Yes, but I think it doesn't process it on error, no?
07:26  temp01: no it doesn't process the response if there's an error
07:26  teolicy: Well, I'd like my error to be JSON, too.
07:27  MagusOTB: rimantas: this is true, but javascript is clientside. If somebody manages to inject JSON data that looks like it is from me, I've got worse things to worry about than my clients running said data.
07:27  temp01: MagusOTB: it's also slower.
07:28  MagusOTB: temp01: really? How can parseJSON() parse it faster than the js interpreter itself?
07:28  temp01: browsers have native JSON.parse method specially meant for parsing JSON

07:38  Randy__: temp01: -sigh- I just copy and pasted the class names from the JavaScript and forgot to remove the "." but its fixed though still not working http://www.jsfiddle.net/DMSve/7/
07:38  teolicy: In css, if I specify <style>.foo.bar { border:0; }</style>, it's the same as <style>.foo .bar { border:0; }</style> (notice the space between ,foo and .bar now), right?
07:38  temp01: you didn't fix shit
07:38  temp01: the dots are still there
07:38  temp01: teolicy: no
07:38  temp01: .foo.bar means one element with both foo and bar classes
07:39  Randy__: temp01: ahh sorry this is the corrent updated url http://www.jsfiddle.net/DMSve/8/
07:39  teolicy: Ah. Thanks.
07:39  temp01: .foo .bar means .bar inside .foo
07:39  temp01: Randy__: it works?
07:39  teolicy: I never saw this notation, and I'm copying a colleagues code (apparently a common thing since I became a 'web programmer'), I thought he made a typo.
07:39  temp01: ?unique id @ Randy__
07:39  bot-t: Randy__, An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
07:40  imakewebthings: ^^ ++
07:40  Randy__: temp01: http://www.jsfiddle.net/DMSve/9/ yes and corrent, those should be another class, but can you have more than one class attr for an html element?
07:40  imakewebthings: if (name == name)

07:43  Randy__: when i change the if statement to if (name == name) it works but if i change it too if (name == "Randy") it doesn't

07:45  josephoenix: This "console.log($('ol.course_list > li > h3').data('code'));" returns null
07:45  Randy__: That might be a bit diffcult since its a script for a chrome exstansion. The Ext. is designed to edit some css and html for a website. Kinda like the style changes ext. for facebook
07:45  unfo-: Randy__, are you sure you don't have a newline your code elsewhere
07:45  josephoenix: as opposed to "EDUC300G-CG-01"
07:46  unfo-: Randy__, maybe you should strip all front and trailing spaces
07:46  Randy__: unfo-: ok how would i go about that?
07:46  teolicy: __hidden__ is how jquery implements show() and hide()?
07:46  teolicy: i.e., if I want an object to be 'hide()' when the page loads, should I set the __hidden__ class on it?
07:46  unfo-: Randy__, G: javascript strip
07:47  Mythmon: is the demo at http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/default.html working for anyone else?
07:47  unfo-: Randy__, or G: javascript trim string
07:47  temp01: teolicy: there's no such thing as __hidden__
07:47  teolicy: temp01: Then it must be in our code.
07:47  temp01: Randy__: use .addClass()
07:47  Mythmon: all i see is a white screen with some text -- no sliders
07:47  teolicy: temp01: How do I make an object hidden (i.e., as if hide() was executed on it) when the page loads?
07:47  temp01: css display:none
07:48  teolicy: Hrmf. I suspect that's what our __hidden__ class does.
07:48  josephoenix: Can someone tell me why jquery .data() isn't working with my html5 data-* attributes?
07:48  Randy__: temp01: inplace of .attr("class", "awesome");? so $(this).addClass("awesome");?
07:48  temp01: yes
07:48  teolicy: But then we always manipulate the hidden-state with addClass removeClass, and not show()/hide(), and I don't know why.... I'll ask someone in my team when people get up.
07:49  imakewebthings: josephoenix: its a 1.4.3 feature

07:51  zwalden: i hate working with dynamic forms
07:51  unfo-: Randy__, great, no problem ;)
07:51  temp01: Randy__: unfo-: jquery has a crossbrowser $.trim
07:51  unfo-: temp01, oh. didn't know that
07:52  unfo-: temp01, i should prolly in the future advise ppl to G: jquery <somethign> instead of javascript <something> :)

08:04  unfo-: josephoenix, yeah you can
08:04  unfo-: josephoenix, that way the element has the event attached to it as soon as it is added
08:05  unfo-: josephoenix, i.e. var div = $("<div />"); div.bind("click", mycoolstuff); body.append(div) for example

09:45  Jarda: yup

09:46  Jarda: it's just another event handler
09:46  level09: okay great !
09:46  akheron: it just adds a new handler each time

09:46  level09: I want to render tabs after some data is returned from ajax
09:47  level09: or in other words, what happens if I call document.ready after the dom is ready
09:49  imakewebthings: you would want to just do what you're doing with the data inside the success handler
09:49  imakewebthings: theres no point in adding it to document.ready
09:53  akheron: imakewebthings: yes there is
09:53  akheron: imakewebthings: if you fire the ajax request before the dom is ready and the result comes very quickly
09:54  imakewebthings: akheron, ok deal

10:30  Ankabout: nlogax: sorry had a little internet problem, lemme see what you said
10:32  Ankabout: nlogax: I can't find the splice method in the jquery docs... am I not looking right??
10:32  nlogax: ?splice
10:32  bot-t: nlogax, Types - JavaScript provides several built-in datatypes. In addition to those, this page documents virtual types like Selectors, enhanced pseudo-types like Events and all and everything you wanted to know a... http://docs.jquery.com/Types
10:32  nlogax: >:|
10:32  nlogax: what the hell, it's undocumented?
10:32  nlogax: ?eval $("p").splice
10:32  bot-t: nlogax: function splice() {[native code]}
10:32  nlogax: anyway, it's just like [].splice
10:33  nlogax: .splice(1,1) splices out element at index 1
10:33  nlogax: jqobj.splice(1,2) gives you el 1 and 2, removing them from jqobj
10:33  nlogax: so you could just splice stuff out until it's empty
10:34  CuDi: im off to sleep
10:34  CuDi: nite ya'll
10:39  Ankabout: nlogax: so I'd do the randomisation at the point where I build the array then?
10:40  nlogax: Ankabout: well if you just have like $("yourstuff"), you can splice out of that one, picking random numbers between 0 and its.length-1
10:41  Ankabout: I currently have $(".project-list .views-row").each(function(index, elm)
10:42  Ankabout: so I'd first have to put each .project-list .views-row into an obj  and then splice them out one by one?
10:43  nlogax: no no, $("..") already gives you the object you need
10:43  Ankabout: oh that automatically selects all of them! ahhh ok
10:44  timing: $.ohoh('#cherso');
10:45  Ankabout: timing: hahahaha
10:45  Ankabout: timing: you should be kicked for that
10:45  timing: true
10:45  timing: never watched it even
10:46  Ankabout: nlogax: damn, just realised this won't work...   since my divs are all floated left, having them activated one by one will not activate them in the right space on the page
10:46  Ankabout: timing: same here, and I'm not planning to. I only listen to 'joketje?' on 538
10:47  nlogax: Ankabout: you could use visibility:hidden; or something else to make them be visiblen't but still stay in place
10:47  Ankabout: ohhh yeah of course
10:47  Ankabout: *facepalm
10:49  Ankabout: nlogax: this should work then right?    $(".project-list .views-row").splice(3).css('display', 'block');
10:50  Ankabout: haven't used the hidden yet, it's still display: none for noe
10:50  Ankabout: now*

10:52  Jackass3D: wheres the jquery mobile
10:52  Jackass3D: channel
10:52  Jackass3D: is it all in here
10:54  Ankabout: technically this should display the first element right?    $(".project-list .views-row").splice(1,1).css('display', 'block');
10:54  Ankabout: it doens't seem to do anything actually
10:55  Cork: Ankabout: whats wrong with .first() or eq(0) ?
10:56  nlogax: Ankabout: i think you get an array back, so you need to jquerify it
10:56  Ankabout: Cork: I'm just trying to get the splice to work, then I'm going to make it random, to display a bunch of divs randomly on the page
10:56  nlogax: Cork: they don't modify the object
10:56  Cork: neither do splice
10:56  Ankabout: splice removes the spliced element from the array :)
10:56  Cork: it returns the reqult
10:57  Ankabout: or so my research tells me thanks to nlogax
10:57  Cork: *result
10:57  Jackass3D: what do u use for testing mobiles app?
10:57  Jackass3D: on desktop
10:57  nlogax: Cork: it returns the spliced out elements, and modifies the object
10:57  Ankabout: nlogax: sorry for the noobie question, but how do I 'jquerify' the returned array?
10:57  nlogax: Ankabout: $(it)
10:58  Mimo: hi is this the most efficient way to check whether a selector exist ::     config.selLogin = $("a#login").length ? $('"a#login')  :  false ;
10:59  Ankabout: nlogax: I did it like this:  .$(splice(1,1)).
10:59  Ankabout: but not sure that's how it works, according to the JS splice doc, it returns the removed element, so not an array
10:59  nlogax: ?eval p = $([1,2,3,4,5]); print(p.length); p.splice(2,3); print(" <-> ", p.length) // @ Cork
10:59  bot-t: Cork: 5 <-> 2
11:00  nlogax: Ankabout: splice isn't a standalone function though, it's a method on jquery objects and arrays
11:00  Ankabout: nlogax: ahh wait, it returns the removed elemen(S), so it is an array
11:00  nlogax: just splice(1,1) by itself should throw some referenceerrors or something in your console
11:01  Ankabout: nlogax: this is the full line of code I've got, which seems grammatically correct to me:   $(".project-list .views-row").$(splice(1,1)).css('display', 'block');
11:01  Ankabout: oh no it's not
11:01  Ankabout: I need to puit it in {} right?
11:01  doonie: puit it nauuuw
11:02  temp01: Cork: slice doesn't splice does
11:02  nlogax: Ankabout: jqobj.$(..) does not work, there's no method named $
11:02  temp01: $.fn.$=$.fn.find
11:02  temp01: THERE IS NOW
11:02  nlogax: BOOM
11:03  Ankabout: o_O
11:10  Ankabout: nlogax: using your little eval up there ^ I tried this... am I getting somewhere closer?   block = $(".project-list .views-row").splice(1,1);   $(block).css('display', 'block');
11:11  nlogax: yeah, closer
11:11  Ankabout: heh, but?
11:11  nlogax: i made an example http://pastebin.me/02f006e48997e5ce87625fd005be60fd
11:12  nlogax: click the big EDIT CODE thing to see codes
11:13  Ankabout: nlogax++
11:13  Ankabout: that's awesome man
11:13  Ankabout: I'll FedEx you a beer
11:13  Ankabout: so I was missing the [0] I see now
11:13  nlogax: mmmm beer
11:14  nlogax: well you can either create a new jquery object like you were doing, or grab the naked element and set the style directly
11:14  nlogax: mmm naked element
11:18  Ankabout: well I can't just take the element, the page has many of them
11:18  Ankabout: so I'll modify it a bit

11:22  clocKwize: hey guys, is there any 'listview' control for jquery? like a table but with horizontal scrolling and resizable columns

11:25  clocKwize: thanks cork
11:25  clocKwize: wow, the font they use makes me feel sick
11:25  Ankabout: nlogax: very strange, but if I take your code, and I simply replace the   var stuff = $("div"),   with   var stuff = $(".project-list .views-row"),    it doesn't work..
11:25  nlogax: should work. did you shove that in doc ready too?
11:27  libertiy: hi everyone

11:28  timing: jqgrid !

11:29  Ankabout: nlogax: here's the full code as it is now:  http://pastebin.com/jzFURye0

11:30  dominikl: hi guys, i'm having some trouble with jquery mobile. I'd like to display a button with an icon within a header bar. I'm using the latest source from github and I can't get it to work.  The button appears, but there is no icon. Were there any changes how to get an iconed button inside a toolbar?
11:31  timing: dominikl: can't you check in firebug or chrome's devtools which ( if any ) image url it tries to access? maybe there is something wrong with the path?
11:35  dominikl: timing: hi there ... the path isn't the problem! jquery mobile doesn't even add the span-element with the icon-css-classes...

11:40  dominikl: timing: true!! thx anyway
11:40  Ankabout: nlogax: it's strange, I just modified the code a bit to have classes in the divs and a containing div, and it works fine with your example... maybe it's a library issue?  I'm using it in a drupal install, but all my other jquery stuff works fine
11:41  nlogax: Ankabout: which version of jquery?
11:42  Ankabout: nlogax: checking...
11:42  libertiy: i was away for a few seconds ;p so jgrid is a good solid jquery grid
11:43  libertiy: i looked at jgrid already i believe, it was a pain to get working somehow
11:43  libertiy: but i could try again i now have flexigrid but that seems to not work in firefox mac ;s
11:43  Ankabout: nlogax: is there a way I can check it with code? like phpinfo?
11:44  nlogax: Ankabout: go to your page and type $.fn.jquery into the console
11:45  Ankabout: 1.2.6
11:45  nlogax: whoa, that's pretty old. lemme check if splice is in it

13:00  xotix: does IE got some problems with getelementbyid?
13:01 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
13:01  destinydriven: is there any way to have a jquery 1.03 plugin running on the same page with 1.4+ without conflict?
13:01  Sleeping_Shadowz: IE love getElementById
13:01  Superman_: how to write a thumbnail scroller any ideas??????
13:01  timing: destinydriven: I know one way, port the plugin to 1.4 :-)
13:01 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:02  timing: Superman_: by opening an editor and write one yourself, or search plugins
13:02  destinydriven: timing: that would have been my other question, I dunno enough jquery to do that
13:02  Superman_: :)
13:02  timing: ah okay
13:02  Superman_: I'm writing timing??
13:02  destinydriven: wanna take a look at it?
13:02  timing: destinydriven: maybe you can do some stuff with noConflict() and use two jqueries?
13:02  markj: xotix unless you're using an IE older than 5.5 you should be fine
13:02  timing: Superman_: then, what's your question? :-)
13:02  destinydriven: ?noConflict
13:02  bot-t: jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
13:03  destinydriven: so I can have one use  $ and another use jQuery?
13:03  Superman_: timing take a look - http://jsfiddle.net/SuWft/
13:03  xotix: 8, but i got a name tag, tahts still the same with ids and name ine ie?
13:04  Superman_: right now the thumb scroller is fixed and static
13:04 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
13:04  temp01: xotix: use jquery not getElementById?
13:05  xotix: yeah, i'll change it
13:05  Superman_: timing
13:05  Superman_: timing
13:05  timing: Superman_: a you want to float it?
13:05  Superman_: yes and they are floating
13:05  Superman_: I want it should look at the images in thumbs. and then do scrolling on all
13:05  poppiez: does anyone have experience with hashchange and iframes? I'm using the BBQ plugin. I've set it up for domain1.com and domain2.com (which is included in an iframe on domain1.com). however, when I use the browser back button I have to hit it twice for the hash on domain1.com to change. any way to fix this?
13:06  Superman_: I only want it count the images and get width and height of each img then use animate({top:"variable"})
13:08  Superman_: timing are you looking at it??
13:08  Sleeping_Shadowz: I used jsfiddle.net. I placed the code and it ran fine. I have the same exact copy of code saved in a folder on my computer. I open it with same browser and it does not work.
13:11  Sleeping_Shadowz: I used jsfiddle.net. I placed the code and it ran fine. I have the same exact copy of code saved in a folder on my computer. I open it with same browser and it does not work.
13:13  jomofcw: Hello =)
13:14  Sleeping_Shadowz: I used jsfiddle.net. I placed the code and it ran fine. I have the same exact copy of code saved in a folder on my computer. I open it with same browser and it does not work.
13:14  timing: SugaSlide: nope sorry, busy here
13:14  SugaSlide: ?
13:16  Sleeping_Shadowz: anyone have any ideas to help me out?
13:16  Cork: Sleeping_Shadowz: might be cross site restrictions
13:16  porton: When I attempt to submit a bug report, it says "Submission rejected as potential spam (Akismet says content is spam)". What to do?
13:16  Sleeping_Shadowz: cause it's on my computer and not online?
13:17  Cork: porton: do you have js diesabled?
13:17  Cork: *disabled
13:17  porton: Cork: Certainly it's enabled.
13:17  Cork: then i donno
13:18  porton: Where to send the bug report?!
13:18  Cork: porton: jquery bugreport?
13:18  quicksilver: Sleeping_Shadowz: browsers generally won't run javascript from local files
13:18  Tomashe: hey guys i got some serious problem
13:18  porton: Cork: Yes
13:19  SugaSlide: isnt var strippedstr = $(str).text() ment to work?
13:19  Cork: porton: http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket
13:19  porton: Cork: I say that it considers it as SPAM!
13:19  Jarda: SugaSlide: most likely it works, if your html in str translates to valid html elements
13:20  SugaSlide: if it doesnt have any html in it?
13:20  Sleeping_Shadowz: quicksilver,  so jquery won't run from local but my javascript can, haha i can see that but it's too funny when i have jquery downloaded in the same folder lol
13:20  nVee: hey guys
13:20  Jarda: SugaSlide: then the selector most likely doesn't return anything sane
13:20  nVee: http://pastebin.com/ni3WTSq0
13:20  SugaSlide: str = "done" or "<body>error</body>" etc
13:20  unomi: porton: maybe the system is getting too many bug reports and is throttling
13:20  porton: http://pastebin.ca/1985259
13:21  nVee: i think my question could combine jquery and javascript - I want my line 6 to open the url download.php with the class example6
13:21  nVee: so that colorbox can open the link
13:21  Jarda: SugaSlide: http://jsfiddle.net/fSQxk/
13:21  nVee: or atleast the link open with colorbox. I have very little javascript experience, anyone know how to do this?
13:22  porton: What's about my bug report in http://pastebin.ca/1985259 ?
13:22  Sleeping_Shadowz: alright, THANKS everyone.  I'll try to build online with JQuery and prey it works without p-offing my customers too much
13:22  destinydriven: anyone here with experiencing porting pluging from jQuery 1.0.3 to 1.4+
13:24  Tomash12: ?
13:24  destinydriven: plugins*
13:24  destinydriven: http://pastie.org/1281392
13:25  nlogax: porton: the problem is that the second selector doesn't match anything
13:25  SugaSlide: Jarda http://www.jsfiddle.net/ZkPxF/
13:25  Cork: destinydriven: i donno if there is one for going all the way, but each release notes for jquery has links for how you update plugins from older versions
13:25  nlogax: porton: log its .length and you'll see that it's 0
13:25  destinydriven: Cork: cool
13:25  porton: nlogax: It matches the p with span inside. It shoudl match
13:25  nlogax: porton: no, you're selecting any descendant of a p with a span inside
13:26  nlogax: porton: "p :has(span)" is not the same as "p:has(span)"
13:26  nlogax: porton: just like "a :hover" is not the same as "a:hover". it's the same as "a *:hover"
13:26  Jarda: SugaSlide: http://www.jsfiddle.net/ZkPxF/2/
13:26  Jarda: works as expected
13:27  nVee: hey guys. How do I open a url using jquery?
13:27 --- SuPr|away is now known as SuPr
13:27  SugaSlide: its 1 of those days :(
13:27  SugaSlide: cant see the diference :(
13:28  SugaSlide: 2 secs
13:28  SugaSlide: ahh typo
13:28  nVee: I am using colorbox and I only know how to call a url with an <a href="url" class="colorboxfunc">
13:28  nlogax: pleasure helping you, portan >:|
13:28  Tomash12: there is a way to create a function that work when everything on the page is set
13:28  Tomash12: set and loaded
13:28  Tomash12: include plugins
13:28  nVee: but I want to write a jquery funciton which will open that page automatically after a certain amount of seconds
13:29  compaq: if you have two function, and you are in an anonymous function, can you change a variable in an named function, namely 'this'?
13:30  SugaSlide: uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ffs
13:30  SugaSlide: i give up today
13:30  SugaSlide: :(
13:31  nlogax: nVee: click() it, if that's what colorbox listens to
13:32  nVee: nlogax: http://pastebin.com/25qkcEVL
13:32  nVee: i think that might explain my problem better
13:32  nVee: the comment on line 6 gives my problem
13:33  compaq: How to edit this of another function: http://jsfiddle.net/JJJQA/ ?
13:33  nVee: nlogax: I want download.php to open after 3 seconds in colorbox
13:34  EugenA: i just want to call php file from a server with ajax, no additional communication client-server
13:35  nlogax: compaq: use call() or apply()
13:35  nlogax: ?mdc call
13:35  bot-t: nlogax, call - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
13:35  Tomash12: there isa cuntion like $(document).complete or somethign?
13:35  Tomash12: ready doesnt look enoght
13:36  nlogax: nVee: i don't get it :)
13:36  nlogax: Tomash12: there's window load. if some flash player comes along and starts loading more stuff, it won't wait for that though
13:36  nVee: nlogax: class="example7" is the identifier which tells colorbox when a url is clicked that I want the link to open in colorbox with example7
13:37  nVee: ill assume you ahve used colorbox in the past?
13:37  compaq: nlogax, that doesn't work in my case, cause the function that creates the 'this' element does other stuff too.  So I just wanted to change one element in all the elements it creates
13:37  nlogax: compaq: then maybe use explicit arguments rather than the implicit one
13:37  compaq: nlogax, not sure what you mean
13:38  clocKwize: hey, is it possible to set the value of the url anchor in javascript?
13:38  nlogax: nVee: yeah, but "ADD class="example7" to this window.location " is the part i don't get
13:38  nVee: okay
13:38  nVee: so because the ahref wont be on the page anywhere
13:38  poppiez: does anyone have experience with hashchange and iframes? I'm using the BBQ plugin. I've set it up for domain1.com and domain2.com (which is included in an iframe on domain1.com). however, when I use the browser back button I have to hit it twice for the hash on domain1.com to change. any way to fix this?
13:39  nVee: I cannot have <a href="url.php" class="example7">
13:39  nVee: i want that to open automatically after 3 seconds
13:39  compaq: nlogax, you mean, use an id='' instead of this, thanks
13:39  nVee: if I just do what I do now (as per pastebin)
13:39  clocKwize: nvm, I can just do window.location.hash
13:39  nVee: after 3 seconds download.php opens
13:40  nVee: in the window as if I would have clicked the URL
13:40  nlogax: yeah
13:40  nVee: but I need class=example7 linked to it somehow that it doesnt open in the new window
13:40  nVee: but that colorbox will give the lightbox with download.php
13:40  nVee: this is as simple as I can explain it
13:40  nVee: it might be my own stupidity taking the wrong approach
13:41  nVee: long story short, I want download.php to open in colorbox after 3 seconds
13:41  nlogax: nVee: just took a look at the colorbox docs, $.colorbox({href:'login.php'})
13:41  nlogax: try that in your setTimeout
13:42  nlogax: but with the correct uri of course
13:42  nVee: off course
13:42  nVee: let me quickly check that
13:42  nVee: thanks so much
13:51  nlogax: did it work?
13:51  nVee: nope
13:51  nlogax: :S
13:51  nVee: still struggling :)
13:51  nVee: but I see the logic
13:51  nVee: and its only 1 page anyways
13:51  nlogax: according to the docs, that's how you should open a colorbox with some stuff in it, without having to bind some clicks to elements
13:51  nVee: http://pastebin.com/7fk1y3g6
13:51  nVee: thats what I have now
13:51  nVee: but it doesnt open it
13:52  nVee: probably syntax issues
13:52  nlogax: you need to quote "download.php"
13:52  nVee: i just dont know how to check for them :)
13:52  nlogax: which browser are you using? firefox has firebug, safari/chrome has webkit inspector
13:52  nlogax: they should both get angry about that
13:53  nVee: getting firebug quick
13:53  nVee: well it still doesnt work
13:53  nVee: weird
13:53  nVee: am I doing the rest correct?
13:54  nlogax: uh wait.. setTimeout(colorbox,3000);
13:54  nlogax: there's no colorbox function/anything in the paste
13:54  nVee: hmmm
13:54 --- djuggler_ is now known as djuggler
13:55  nlogax: nVee: http://pastebin.com/m4gDHGEi should be enough
13:56  nlogax: maybe stick it all inside doc ready, if you want it to be 3s from that
13:57  nVee: nlogax:
13:57  nVee: you're a star!!!!
13:57  nVee: thanks for the help!
13:58  nlogax: :)
14:01  doonie: nlogax I have loads of stuff in my doc ready, but essential links that use post/json show errors if users click on them too fast, any solution to that other than hide all until doc ready done?
14:04  nlogax: doonie: the nicest thing would be if they worked without js too.. but uhh.. you can fix it in a number of ways, but i don't know a really nice way
14:04  nlogax: doonie: one is using onclick (eww), another is inserting a script element just below the link, so that you can add event listeners to it really quick (also quite ewwy)
14:05  doonie: heh
14:06  nlogax: did the onclick thing at my old job.. so that we could put all js down below. except for a tiny function that kept track of all the clicks and stuff
14:07  doonie: think its easier to show a modal until it loads, as I dont want them to click anything anyhow. or somehow disable all links...
14:07  nlogax: but.. i assume you load scripts in the <head>? since you're using doc ready
14:08  nlogax: that means you could have a temporary handler that just queues stuff up.. that could be frustrating too, if it takes a long time to load
14:08 --- matjas_ is now known as matjas
14:09  nlogax: or maybe you can just change it to use delegate() or live(), then you don't have to wait for doc ready either
14:09  doonie: i have it placed in the </body> actually
14:09  doonie: maybe I don't need the docready then
14:09  nlogax: not if it's at the bottom, no
14:10  doonie: great, didn't think about that. been mixing things up I guess. will try without to see if it's any faster
14:10  nlogax: but watch out for IE, i think it gets mad if you try to append stuff to the body before it has parsed </body>
14:10  doonie: hehe
14:10  xotix: when i have a div with generated stuff inside. and i call my dialog of that div. why does the value change? it is a li element and the value isnt the same if its open or closed
14:11  Jarda: oh god
14:11  Jarda: why can't datepicker be a widget
14:11  Jarda: extending it would be that much easier..
14:12  nlogax: :(
14:14  Jarda: ok, so this is almost impossible to extend
14:14  Jarda: I just would want to replace one function..
14:14  compaq: if I have <img id="imga" />, Can I refer to it by $(img #imga) ?
14:14  Noeble: question: I am doing a jsonget and with that info I populate a dropdown menu (a <select>). What I need is to make the first option populated, to also be selected. How can I make this happen?
14:14  Noeble: the code: http://pastebin.se/202430
14:15  iszak: So I went on the jQuery UI site to view source to get jquery ui source (I know there are other ways) and my god, what is with people using things without any need? for example <!--[if IE 5]><div id="ie5" class="ie"><![endif]-->  I don't see no ie5 anchoring, it's just a giant circlejerk lets all be sheep and follow someone.
14:15  iszak: What's that? HTML5 doctype? but it's not using HTML5 elements?
14:16  iszak: It's like, hey lets all jump on the bandwagon even if we don't understand, I expected better.
14:16  doonie: iszak maybe you found an easteregg ;D
14:16  iszak: Be quiet.
14:17  Cork: iszak: whats the problem with it?
14:17  Jarda: iszak: you serious?
14:18  compaq: if I change the source of an image, does it automatically update?  Or does it require a trigger?
14:18  iszak: I mean seriously, who the FUCK supports ie5?
14:18  iszak: it's like supporting IE Mac.
14:18  Cork: iszak: one of the big parts of jquery it the support for old ie browsers
14:18  iszak: IE6+ last time I checked.
14:19  Cork: well, ya, but it works fine most of the times in 5 and 5.5 too
14:19  iszak: Cork, and I'm sure they test vigorously for IE5 and 5.5.
14:19  nlogax: IE5/mac had png alpha support, at least
14:19  iszak: I doubt they even test it in IE5 or 5.5.
14:19  juha_: how about ie 3?
14:20  juha_: it's important to support that
14:20  Cork: iszak: what is it to be so ubset about?
14:20  Cork: *upset
14:20  nlogax: but is it supportant to import it?
14:20  Noeble: question: I am doing a getJSON and with that info I populate a dropdown menu (a <select>). What I need is to make the first option populated, to also be selected. How can I make this happen?
14:20  Noeble: the code: http://pastebin.se/202430
14:21  iszak: Cork, because I expected better from the developers of jQuery UI.
14:21  iszak: Furthermore I hate how everyone jumps on a new technology/technique without fully understanding it.
14:21  nlogax: Noeble: did you try attr("selected", "selected"=
14:21  nlogax: ?
14:21  iszak: I would like to think of the HTML5 boiler plate as a godsend but it's becoming more and more less like that, just a noob friendly HTML5-ready template.
14:21  StevenTyler: jquery should support lynx too, else i condemn it as incomplete
14:22  Noeble: nlogax: yes. Doesnt work.
14:22  Noeble: nlogax: The first option is selected at load of the page.. or it looks like it but it isnt.
14:23  Cork: iszak: expected "better" removeing support on the advertizement page for backwards compatibility??
14:23  ravenzz: hello there
14:23  Noeble: nlogax: if I manualy type an option in that select it gets selected at load, but not when I loop through a json object
14:23  iszak: Cork, do we even know if the site works in IE5? why are they wasted there time supporting IE5?
14:23  iszak: If they're not supporting IE5 why the hell is that line in there.
14:24  iszak: Because they read it off paul irish's blog and modified it a bit?
14:24  Cork: iszak: it might be as simple as its not that much more work then supporting ie6, and it might be its not the same ppl developing the packages
14:24  iszak: Cork, I don't believe that.
14:24  iszak: Furthermore I see no anchors to the ie5 id.
14:24  Cork: why do you need anchors for??
14:25  iszak: anchors e.g. a link/reference.
14:25  Cork: its just css parents
14:25  iszak: e.g. #ie5
14:25  Cork: i looked at it way back
14:25  Mimo: trick question named Named function expressions or not so var myfn = function(){} or function myfn(){}
14:25  iszak: So now unless they're user agent sniffer and serving IE CSS which makes it even more useless they're not even using it.
14:25  Cork: they use it for #ie5 .css_overide
14:25  iszak: no they don't.
14:25  nVee: anyone use colorbox? My close button does not show, want to find out how to I manually create one or have mine shown?
14:26  iszak: maybe on another page perhaps.
14:26  Cork: well they did
14:26  Cork: might be they removed the css overides, but left the divs
14:26  erichynds: using an html5 doctype doesn't mean you must use html5 elements
14:26  iszak: genius programmers.
14:26  iszak: erichynds, I know but what's the point? it's like using XHTML doctype without using XHTML specific features.
14:26  iszak: Which I might remind A LOT of people still do.
14:27  erichynds: shorter, easier to type, less bytes going down the pupe
14:27  erichynds: pipe
14:27  xotix: when i have a hidden div, genereted with document ready (li elements) and the value="1" it set. i open this div as dialog and the value is "", why?
14:27  iszak: erichynds, yet they couldn't remove the ie5 condcom?
14:27  erichynds: 99% of the web uses xhtml doc type and don't even serve xhtml mime type, which is wrong
14:27  iszak: my god, think of the bytes implication.
14:27  erichynds: i'd rater see an html5 doctype and no html5 elems
14:27  Cork: iszak: sadly the xhmtl doctype doesn't mean so much, if your not sending the page as the correct mime type, it will be read as broken html anyway
14:27  Cork: *xhtml
14:27  iszak: Exactly.
14:27  erichynds: iszak, probably could, perhaps you should ask someone or open a bug on the tracker
14:27  nlogax: Noeble: quick hax.. http://pastebin.me/8dcd1ad244860248e3952635ebcc0e7a using attr(), appears to wor
14:27  nlogax: K!
14:28  Noeble: looking
14:28  erichynds: maybe they used it at some point and it was never removed
14:28  iszak: But tell me what benefit is it using HTML5 doctype over HTML4 besides.. "bytes" god forbid.
14:28  erichynds: either way, WAHHHH
14:28  minver: I want to be able to select a null (empty string) value in my autocomplete combobox. How is that possible?
14:28  erichynds: iszak, why not?
14:28  Cork: iszak: browsers that support html5 will give you better error corrections
14:28  iszak: there shouldn't be errors.
14:28  Cork: iszak: or rather all browsers will error correct the same way
14:29  iszak: erichynds, because it's the same situation as really the xhtml debate.
14:29  Cork: iszak: ya, but count the number of public sites with no html errors...
14:29  iszak: Cork, lots.
14:29  connrs: cool
14:29  iszak: and heaps with errors.
14:29  sean``: iszak, there's a different between moving sideways and ahead
14:29  Cork: iszak: ya, but compared to the numbers with many errors
14:29  iszak: sean``, elaborate?
14:29  erichynds: why not use the shortest thing to trigger standards mode?
14:29  erichynds: that all browsers support anyway?
14:30  iszak: why not use HTML4 because you're not using HTML5?
14:30  sean``: iszak, html4 is followed by html5
14:30  iszak: HTML5 specific features.
14:30  Noeble: nlogax: is that picking teh first choice?
14:30  sean``: xhtml is a step sidewards
14:30  iszak: sean``, It wasn't seen as that some time ago however.
14:30  sean``: it's on another track
14:30  iszak: I am not here to argue XHTML use though.
14:30  nlogax: Noeble: no, just tested with some position. change eq(2) to eq(0) for the first one
14:30  Noeble: kk
14:31  nlogax: Noeble: iirc, you can also do select[0].selectedIndex = 0
14:32  sean``: LOL
14:32 * doonie whips sean`` with a mouse cord
14:32  sean``: yammm
14:32  iszak: do people still use mouse cords? :P
14:32  timing: jQuery, it really whips the sean's ass
14:33  doonie: iszak yes, crossbrowser and all <3
14:33  iszak: + it's faster to receive signals!!
14:33  iszak: think of the delay with gaming if you were using wireless.
14:33  doonie: you mean give ;>

19:32  Locus_Asaf: I'm having an issue with the radio button
19:32 @ajpiano: philk__: use whichever one you want, petes is the leanest, considering that ben says "don't use this abstraction" in the comments of the gist
19:32  Locus_Asaf: In particular with the form validation partt

19:33  philk__: why does https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/raw/master/pubsub.js have ";" right in front of the closure?
19:34  paul_irish: protection for concatenation
19:34  Noeble: question: how come my script doesnt run when I paste it into a .js file? It runs fine if I run the code directly on the page.
19:34  davidflam: How can I make a datepicker appear over an applet?
19:35 @ajpiano: Noeble, is the code in a document ready block in the js file?
19:35  oodavid: janthony: assuming your data object doesn't describe the DOM on the page, do this: $("#results").html(data.coupon_results);
19:35  oodavid: etc
19:35  t0th_-: hi
19:35  t0th_-: i have a div id="test"
19:35  erichynds: nice
19:35  t0th_-: how i can add a div id="test2" before test
19:35  t0th_-: ?
19:36  erichynds: insertBefore
19:36  philk__: paul_irish: thanks! Just today "duck-punched" the $.ajax function to let it query alternative urls given in settings.url as an array. Thanks for your blog post
19:36  paul_irish: tight, bro
19:36  erichynds: $('<div id="test2"></div>").insertBefore("#test") t0th_-
19:36  t0th_-: [erichynds]: thanks
19:36  Locus_Asaf: can anyone help me with a problem I'm having here http://jsfiddle.net/MPuQF/7/ ?
19:37  janthony: oodavid: yup, that worked! thanks!
19:37  Phrogz: Locus_Asaf: What's the problem? What should I do to reproduce, what did you expect, what are you seeing, what browser?
19:37  Locus_Asaf: I'm using firefox
19:38  Locus_Asaf: when you run the page, check the checkbox and click the little mouse image
19:38  oodavid: np
19:38  Noeble: ajpiano: yes it is, I only skip the <script> tags when I move the code into the new js file
19:38 @ajpiano: a live demo would kinda help
19:38  Locus_Asaf: an alert should pop up that says the value of the radio button, the problem is no matter what the state of the radio button is, the alert is always returning the same value
19:38  Noeble: ajpiano: hmm might be hard, I can give u code
19:38  Noeble: sec
19:39  brandini: AHA! $(this).parent().next(".summary").toggle(); == pr0fit!
19:39  Hopsy: bot-t: ?
19:39  bot-t: Hopsy, Is that a question?
19:40  Phrogz: Locus_Asaf: A single radio button always has the same value.
19:40  Phrogz: Locus_Asaf: Did you want a :checked in there?
19:40  erichynds: Locus_Asaf, don't you want FinanceRateInput instead of FinanceRate?
19:40  Hopsy: Lampoon: seen Sugaslide
19:40  Lampoon: SugaSlide was last seen in #jquery 1 hour 15 min ago saying 'mkay'.
19:40  Hopsy: Lampoon: seen coldhead
19:40  Lampoon: coldhead was last seen in #jquery 8 hours 49 min ago saying 'also a classic nirvana album'.
19:40  Noeble: ajpiano: http://pastebin.se/202433
19:40  Locus_Asaf: Phrogz: I want that alert to return the value of the checked radio button
19:40  Noeble: ajpiano: this is the page that works
19:41  Phrogz: Locus_Asaf: So   $('input[name=FinanceRate]:checked').val()
19:41 --- hacked_ is now known as hacked
19:41  Locus_Asaf: Phrogz: thanks!
19:42  Phrogz: Locus_Asaf: You're welcome. Next time, you might try paring it down even further.
19:42  Locus_Asaf: I see the difference between that and the event handler for the .change function
19:42  Noeble: ajpiano: and I remove the script and I add a script link to my js file
19:42  Locus_Asaf: that's what was confusing me
19:42 @ajpiano: Noeble: this is why pastes of static code are not enlightening
19:42 @ajpiano: i don't know anything i didn't konw before
19:43  Noeble: hmm lemme see what I can do
19:43  hdon: anyone here use the jquery inheritance plugin?
19:43  hdon: i have a static method that needs a reference to its own static method table (the constructor)
19:44  hdon: i guess if i know the name of the constructor i can do it that way
19:44  Noeble: ajpiano: just a sec. Enabling port in firewall.
19:46  brandini: how should I create an ajax load() for each item I have in a list using the item.id to create the callback?
19:47  brandini: I've been told that onclick="" is not the place to do that
19:48  hdon: brandini, if all the "items" are created before the DOM is ready (static HTML items) select your items with jQuery and use .click(function(){/* use .load() here (/})
19:48  hdon: brandini, if these items may change during the document, use the same selector but with .live: $(selector).live('click', function(){/* use .load() here */})
19:49  brandini: hdon: what I do now is build a url like .load('/admin/getfileinfo/5') where five is generated using the file.id
19:50  hdon: brandini, the click handler will receive the relevant DOM element as "this," so you may find the .id from that
19:50  Noeble: ajpiano: http://81.216.105.80:8000/index3/
19:50  brandini: hdon: I mean, file.id is an item in the list that I'm iterating over
19:51  Noeble: ajpiano: working example without the js.
19:51 @ajpiano: peol: ok
19:51 @ajpiano: Noeble: ok
19:51  brandini: hdon: sorry, that was unclear
19:51  hdon: brandini, you have not mentioned iteration before
19:51  peol: ajpiano: ok!
19:51  hdon: brandini, is the list a GUI list? can the user see it and click it to .load() something? or is the list just a javascript array?
19:51  hdon: brandini, i assumed because you mentioned .click() that it is a GUI list
19:52  brandini: hdon: this is a list of files and the user can click on a file to get the summary of the file
19:52  hdon: brandini, ok, i will give a concrete example to make my answer very clear to you :)
19:52  brandini: thanks :)
19:52  hdon: brandini, suppose this is your file list: <ul><li id=file1>file 1</li><li id=file2>file 2</li></ul>
19:53 * brandini headdesks
19:53  brandini: ok duh
19:53  brandini: thanks hdon
19:53  hdon: brandini, you can use $('ul li').click(function(){$('#placeToLoadDetails').load('details?id='+this.id)})
19:53  hdon: brandini, if the list changes dynamically, you must not use click() or the click() handler will be lost to new items in the list
19:54  hdon: brandini, then you want to use .live('click', handler...
19:54  Noeble: ajpiano: shall I switch to linking the js file?
19:54  brandini: hdon: one last question... I have a toggle() for the visibility of where the results are displayed, but my .load() is called when I view or close
19:54 @ajpiano: Noeble ye
19:54  hdon: brandini, could you explain more?
19:54  BrianB04: I have a question, though it's not entirely about jQuery. I stumbled upon a site awhile back that allowed you to insert HTML, then jQuery (Or other javascript code) and the site would eval that and show what happens. Does anyone here know the name of that site?
19:54  brandini: hdon: let me finish doing the last bit of changes you just gave me and I'll paste some code :)
19:55  hdon: ok :)
19:55  erichynds: BrianB04, jsfiddle.net
19:55  BrianB04: erichynds: Thank you.
19:55  Noeble: ajpiano: now
19:55  erichynds: or jsbin.com
19:55  BrianB04: I have been going nuts trying to search for that.
19:56 @ajpiano: Noeble: you're missing a comma
19:56 @ajpiano: Noeble are you using a debugger

19:57  davidflam: How can I make a datepicker appear over an applet?
19:57 @ajpiano: noeble    $.getJSON('/getappcat/', {format:"json"} , function(data) {
19:57  Noeble: ajpiano: hmm no I aint. is ther a debuger plugin for chrome/ff?
19:57  serio: davidflam: applet?
19:57 @ajpiano: there's one built into chrome, hit cmd-shift-i / ctrl-shift-i
19:57  bakers: ajpiano: How did you get that inline error/ Is that just firebug?
19:57  davidflam: serio: yes
19:57  serio: as in java?
19:57 @ajpiano: bakers: webkit inspector
19:57  hdon: Noeble, firebug for firefox (getfirebug.com) chrome has builtin javascript console (debugger also i believe)
19:57  bakers: ajpiano: Nice
19:58  davidflam: serio: yes, ur right
19:58  bakers: Firefox 4 will ship with a console app, like a Firebug Lite
19:58  hdon: davidflam, i believe serio asked you "as in java?"
19:58  hdon: nevermind
19:58  brandini: hdon: that worked BRILLIANTLY!
19:58  brandini: :)
19:58  hdon: brandini, great :)
19:59  serio: davidflam, I'm not sure there's a way you can overlay html on to of a java applet.
19:59  hdon: brandini, remember if your items change, they will lose a regular .click() handler, you must use .live()
19:59  serio: without it being all buggy n shit.
19:59  brandini: hdon: I'll paste up some code for the next bit of discussion
19:59  brandini: ok
19:59 * hdon nods
19:59  brandini: I'm using 'bind()'
19:59  davidflam: serio: i got to iframe shim
19:59  davidflam: have u heard of that?
20:00  serio: no
20:00  brandini: hdon: http://pastebin.com/hASK92mP
20:01  brandini: the .load() is called each time I click on that element... making two calls to the app when it should really only do it when I'm doing .show()
20:02  brandini: oh, and I sent you the python template instead of just straight html... sorry :)
20:02  arex\: What events should I look for when making a kind of autocomplete? keyup triggers when someone tabs to the field, but change is too infrequent
20:02  hdon: brandini, which element are you clicking that causes two calls to .load()?
20:02  brandini: keypress 'space' arex\?
20:02  Noeble: ajpiano: u were correct. Missing the ,. Iam gonna use the debugger.
20:02  brandini: hdon: it's the span class="review_count"
20:03  Noeble: ajpiano: when I use the script on another page, I get this error in the debugger: "TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function"
20:03  Noeble: what does that mean?
20:03 @ajpiano: that means jquery isn't loaded properly
20:03  arex\: brandini: i want any character key i think... do i have to use keyup and check what key was pressed?
20:03  brandini: arex\: yes
20:03  Noeble: ajpiano: hmm but it is, cuz I run other scripts with jquery
20:03 @ajpiano: oh
20:03 @ajpiano: it means maybe noConflict has run, or something
20:03  Noeble: on the same page
20:03  arex\: brandini: but how the * do i check if a "character" is pressed? :P
20:03  Noeble: ah yes
20:03 @ajpiano: are you using jQuery and $
20:04  Noeble: using $
20:04 @ajpiano: aww man Noeble you are making me feel awesome right now btw
20:04  brandini: arex\: no idea
20:04  Noeble: ajpiano: hah why?:D
20:04  hdon: brandini, hmm
20:04 @ajpiano: 'm in the middle of working on a presentation on basic jquery debugging techniques
20:04  brandini: hdon: do you see what I'm doing?
20:04 @ajpiano: you are reminding me of why its necessary :)
20:04  Noeble: ajpiano: :D
20:04  brandini: hdon: it seems like something that would be pretty easy/common
20:04  hdon: brandini, have you used fiddle? could you mock up an example to show the behavior?
20:05  hdon: brandini, http://jsfiddle.net/
20:05  brandini: hdon: let me try it out
20:05  Noeble: ajpiano: as u said, jQuery.noConflict(); ran on a script above
20:05  Noeble: what does that do?
20:06 @ajpiano: ?noConflict
20:06  bot-t: jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
20:06  RobW: what's the proper selector to select all elements with class that's not $(this) ?
20:06 @ajpiano: RobW $(".foo").not(this)
20:06  RobW: ah you can do that? nice
20:06  Michael: Zomgies
20:06  josephsaliba: hey guys ... imagine i have <div id="box1"><div id="header"></div></div> <div id="box2"><div id="header></div></div>
20:07  Noeble: ajpiano: yes. what does noconflict do?
20:07  josephsaliba: how can i access each of the header with jquery?
20:07  paul_irish: guys if i say the word "Documentation" do you think of A) api reference  or B) tutorials and guides
20:07 @ajpiano: Noeble: "Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable"
20:07  paul_irish: plz vote
20:07  paul_irish: guys if i say the word "Documentation" do you think of A) api reference  or B) tutorials and guides
20:07  paul_irish:  
20:07  Noeble: ajpiano: is it safe to remove? it worked fine withut it
20:07 @ajpiano: paul_irish, i'm gonna say A)
20:07  snover: paul_irish: a
20:07 @ajpiano: Noeble, why did you put it in there in the first place
20:08  Michael: paul_irish, API ref
20:08  Michael: Tutorials are usually a separate link
20:08  Noeble: ajpiano: its in a template file that I bought.
20:08 @ajpiano: awesome
20:08 * ajpiano punches self in face
20:08  Noeble: heh
20:08 @ajpiano: what exactly did you "buy" that was in this template
20:09  darcyclarke_: paul_irish A)
20:09  RobW: $('.contentSubAltMainMenuLi a').not(this).parent().removeClass('opened').find('.listAlt').slideUp(); - .not(this) is still selecting (this)
20:09  brandini: hdon: it doesn't seem to be working properly, but this is it... http://jsfiddle.net/JwRTw/5/
20:09  Noeble: its a desinged admin template, and since i dont design I buy :)
20:09  paul_irish: RobW: brandini Noeble.. plz vote ^ ^

20:09  josephsaliba: ?
20:09 * hdon clicks
20:09 * RobW Pimp Slaps paul_irish
20:09  SugaSlide: boooooooom
20:09  darcyclarke_: paul_irish the best of both worlds would be an api reference with links for tutorials and use cases
20:09  RobW: paul_irish: vote for?
20:10  paul_irish: guys if i say the word "Documentation" do you think of A) api reference  or B) tutorials and guides
20:10  RobW: a
20:10  SugaSlide: sup pi
20:10  hdon: brandini, you had mootools selected in the framework section. select jQuery and then click update, give me the new link :)
20:10  SugaSlide: i think of both?
20:10  brandini: ahhhhhh that's why!
20:10  BrianB04: paul_irish: Tutorials and guides.
20:10  hdon: brandini, if you choose onDomReady under framework, you don't need to do $(document).ready() yourself, it is already wrapped around your code :)
20:11  brandini: http://jsfiddle.net/JwRTw/6/
20:11  serio: I would say documentation refers to api
20:11  hdon: brandini, ahhhhhhhhh, i see!
20:11  brandini: hdon: what you can't see is that it's loading www.google.com each time you click
20:11  hdon: jquery veterans: what's the most succinct way to .toggle() and then only take further action if the new state is visible?
20:12  SugaSlide: documentation = anything that helps you with the "thing"
20:12  darcyclarke_: jQuery(function($){ ... }); #FTW
20:12  SugaSlide: manual, pamphlet, etc
20:12  paul_irish: toggle().filter(':visible').stuff()

20:12  RobW: I've even tried .not($(this))
20:12  brandini: paul_irish: that looks useful :)
20:13  josephsaliba: how can i access the 2 different headers with jquery ?
20:13  paul_irish: headers?
20:13  paul_irish: o.
20:13  RobW: $("h1,h2")
20:13  serio: paul_irish, I don't know why anybody would think 'documentation' refered to tutorials.

20:14 @ajpiano: ?w3c id error @ josephsaliba
20:14  bot-t: josephsaliba, An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
20:14  RobW: line 10
20:14  paul_irish: o. :)
20:14  paul_irish: boom
20:14  hdon: does any browser throw a javascript exception if you attempt to set a redundant DOM ID?
20:14 * hdon thinks not
20:14 @ajpiano: no
20:14  jqp: could someone explain why http://jsfiddle.net/rnuBK/ works qith jquery 1.4.2 but not 1.4.3?
20:14 @ajpiano: but shit won't work
20:14 @ajpiano: sooo
20:15  paul_irish: RobW: you can probably use .siblings() instead of the not()
20:15  brandini: man, what a productive day in UI land!!
20:15  paul_irish: sorta kinda
20:15  hdon: :)
20:15  Noeble: ajpiano: I got everything I needed to work now. Ty. the debugger was a catch :)
20:15 @ajpiano: :)
20:15  Noeble: gl with the debug paper
20:15  paul_irish: ajpiano: check out jqp's fiddle.
20:15  paul_irish: or snover ^
20:15  RobW: paul_irish: oh ffs I forgot about .siblings, thanks :)
20:16 @ajpiano: jqp: you can't do x-domain ajax like that
20:16  SugaSlide: anyone have the google api link to the ui style sheet handy?
20:16  darcyclarke_: paul_irish so are all the awesome JS dev's in Boston right now?
20:16 @ajpiano: jquery 1.4.2 was a little wonky and called success on ajax handlers
20:16 @ajpiano: when it shouldn't have been called
20:16  paul_irish: not all of them.
20:16  paul_irish: <3
20:16  darcyclarke_: haha
20:17 @ajpiano: jqp: an ajax request of http://www.google.com will never be successful
20:17 @ajpiano: because of the single origin policy
20:17  snover: same origin
20:17 @ajpiano: eat a ball
20:17  snover: eat a bag of balls
20:17  jqp: ajpiano: i'm getting a similar situation even when not xss-ing, though (i can't think of how to demo it through jdfiddle)
20:17  paul_irish: of balls.
20:17  darcyclarke_: ajpiano ...
20:17  darcyclarke_: lol
20:17 @ajpiano: jqp: see the "Testing AJAX Requests" part of jsfiddle
20:18  serio: ajpiano says "eat a ball" because he was only born with one
20:18  serio: :(
20:19  hdon: is arguments.callee portable? or is that only a mozillaism
20:19  jqp: ajpiano: ah, thanks.  so i tried http://jsfiddle.net/rnuBK/1/, and am still getting inconsistent results between 1.4.3 and 1.4.2
20:20  brandini: hdon: How would I make .filter() look to see if .next(".summary") is visible?
20:20  jqp: (and that more closely resembles my problem)
20:20  darcyclarke_: Pretty sure I just got a look from someone in Starbucks that went something like ".... is that IRC? yikes... nerd... " ... ... ... to barrista ~ "I'll take a ridiculous latte thanks"
20:20  hdon: brandini, .filter() simply allows you to refine a jQuery set. so $('a:visible') is the same as $('a').filter(":visible")
20:21  brandini: ok
20:21  hdon: brandini, it is easy to hide *all* other .summar if you want that
20:21  hdon: .summary
20:21  brandini: hrmmm, it doesn't appear to be working for me yet
20:21  hdon: darcyclarke_, hahaha
20:21  wesbos: hah
20:22  wesbos: irc ftw
20:22  hdon: darcyclarke_, my roommate was pretty shocked in a positive way when he saw me "going to work" one day. i telecommute. everything i do is over ssh/screen and xchat :D
20:24  Billy1: hey, can anyone point me in the right direction to search a server response for a certain element id, take the contents of that element and put it in another element
20:24  jqp: ajpiano: it looks like http://jsfiddle.net/rnuBK/4/ gives a consistent result -- the issue may have been that $(window).ajaxSuccess(...) wasn't getting bound to anything
20:24  Billy1: i tried using .find with little luck
20:25  brandini: hdon: so putting .filter() in with $(this).parent().next(".summary").toggle().filter().load() should have matched the visibility of the right .summary
20:25  wesbos: I ran my first jQuery mobile app on my phone as a native app today
20:25  wesbos: pretty sweet
20:26  hdon: brandini, sorry, i am busy now! others will help you :)
20:26  brandini: ok!
20:26  brandini: Thanks again!
20:27  brandini: paul_irish: can you take a look at this and tell me why filter isn't working properly? http://jsfiddle.net/JwRTw/14/
20:27  paul_irish: nope cant right now
20:27  paul_irish: buzy
20:27  brandini: ok
20:28 @ajpiano: hmm
20:28 @ajpiano: wth is jQuery.ajaxSuccess undefined in jquery 1.4.3 +
20:29  brandini: ahhh, my antique 1.3.2.min needed updated :)
20:29  brandini: THAT'S why!
20:29  darcyclarke_: brandini :)
20:29  hdon: ajpiano, did you define a success handler for your ajax?
20:29  brandini: hdon: problem solved!
20:29 @ajpiano: hdon: i'm not having any trouble with any code
20:29  snover: ajpiano: it’s $.fn
20:29  hdon: ajpiano, sounds like jQuery did this somewhere: (settings.success||jQuery.ajaxSuccess)(args)
20:29  brandini: hopefully 1.4.3 is backwards compatible with all my other crappy jquery!
20:30 @ajpiano: snover, it was there in 1.4.2
20:30 @ajpiano: wait nm
20:30  darcyclarke_: ajpiano , paul_irish bought fnjquery.com the other day ;)
20:30 * ajpiano retarded
20:30  snover: ajpiano: :)
20:30 @ajpiano: ugh
20:30  snover: ajpiano: you almost had me there for a minute
20:30 @ajpiano: stupid global ajax events
20:30 @ajpiano: who uses them
20:30  snover: nobody because “global” is a huge misnomer
20:30  snover: change the context and they are no longer global
20:31 @ajpiano: i literally thought you bound them by doing $.ajaxStart(fn).... lol
20:32  hdon: ugh i wish jquery inheritance would give me a reference to the constructor a static method was defined for
20:32  hdon: it will only give me the inherited constructor :C
20:37  jqp: anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/rnuBK/6/ has inconsistent results between 1.4.3 and 1.4.2?
20:38 @ajpiano: jqp: it seems like ajax events are only bubbling to the doucment, not the window, now
20:38 @ajpiano: hm
20:43  hdon: darcyclarke_, clearly fn.jquery.com should be the jquery plugin directory
20:43  darcyclarke_: hdon that would be smart
20:44  darcyclarke_: hdon fnjquery.com = all mine though ;) I'll look into turning it into a resource for plugins I think.. that or a one pager on how to extend jquery
20:44  darcyclarke_: "effin jquery" ;)

20:46  vrtigo: yay, came to work and someone had upgraded both my monitors
20:46  vrtigo: extra inches!! ^_^
20:46  hdon: vrtigo, more pixels too i hope :)
20:46  vrtigo: neg :/
20:46  vrtigo: but thats ok
20:47 * hdon 's pixels are the perfect size. any smaller and their detail would only be good for pictures.
20:48  vrtigo: tbh, text was a bit small before, now its pretty good
20:48  jqp: ajpiano: is it a bug that 1.4.3 doesn't support binding global ajax events to the window object?
20:49 @ajpiano: jqp: tryna decide that now
20:49  aaroninfidel: can someone tell me the difference between a prototype property and a public property?

20:51 @ajpiano: yes please

21:22  yi: hey guys.  I'm trying to write a jquery plugin and everything initializes properly, but I was wondering how to access the properties or helper functions of the jquery extension after it has been initialized?
21:22  paul_irish: god she is beautiful.
21:22 * serio nods
21:23  serio: I think that perhaps she isn't quite as beautiful as she appears in these airbrushed photos.
21:23  serio: but, it's nice to dream.
21:23  yi: for instance if you do $("#some_div").plugin(); and plugin() has some properties or helper functions inside of it how would you reference these?
21:23  Jackass3D|elite: what girl!
21:23  shredcopter: I have a function bound to an <a> element using .click. Within the function I have the code $(this).fadeOut(); , yet when I click the element nothing happens.

21:24  ambackstrom|fsck: What's the selector for every td in column 3 in a table?
21:25  ambackstrom|fsck: My use of :eq() is just giving me the third cell, rather than the third cell in every row
21:25  ambackstrom|fsck: $('tbody tr td:eq(3)')
21:25  serio: use the eq on the tr, not the td
21:25 @ajpiano: ?:nth-child @ ambackstrom|fsck
21:25  bot-t: ambackstrom|fsck, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
21:25  serio: or that.
21:26  ambackstrom|fsck: :nth-child() seems to work. what would the eq syntax look like, serio?
21:26  vrtigo: pewpew girl is the pinnacle of nerdy dreams
21:27 @ajpiano: there is no eq syntax that would work for this, you want to use nth child
21:29  brandini: ok, I won't be able to use .next() like I want to :(
21:29  serio: pewpew girl is the pinnacle of WET dreams
21:29  brandini: I have <div class="a"></div> <div class="b"></div> and .next() doesn't find div class="b"
21:30  serio: .next( 'div' ) ?
21:30  ambackstrom|fsck: .nextAll('.b')?
21:30  brandini: nextAll!
21:31  brandini: that sounds useful!
21:31  josephsaliba: how can i display on and off rows of a table with jquery?
21:31  brandini: HAH!

21:31  hExDj: I am using jquery mobile on an iphone 4 when I rotate the screen sometimes the fonts look pixelated
21:31  ambackstrom|fsck: josephsaliba: $('tr').hide();
21:32  ambackstrom|fsck: josephsaliba: or have a "hidden" class that you toggleClass() or add/remove

21:33  serio: MatthewG, how is it off topic?
21:33  brandini: ambackstrom|fsck: BAH nextAll does every summary on the page :)
21:34  serio: jQuery mobile is in the topic.
21:34 @ajpiano: devinrolsen, you'll need to put the nested assignemnt in the ternary in parens
21:34  MatthewG: serio: it's CSS and iPhone specific? :) (has nothing to do with jquery)
21:34  devinrolsen: ahh
21:34  serio: pretty sure css has something to do with jQuery
21:34  MatthewG: serio: (I still could have said it here, but I did PM because I thought it was off topic... if that's cool here, I can answer here :))
21:34 @ajpiano: i current = + i ...
21:34  ambackstrom|fsck: brandini: nextAll('.b').first()
21:34 @ajpiano: looks plain wrong to me though, devinrolsen
21:34  serio: and in the context of jQuery mobile, iPhone as well.
21:35  MatthewG: serio: Then I stand corrected :) I'll keep it here

21:39  snover: josephsaliba: what have you tried?
21:39  josephsaliba: $("#unitPrice").html("text");
21:40  josephsaliba: ??
21:41  shredcopter: serio, can you take a look at my code? http://www.fixee.org/paste/ml09ddm/
21:41  shredcopter: i'm positive it's a problem with 'this', but i don't know how to fix it
21:41  shredcopter: it's definitely not pointing at the right element
21:42  ambackstrom|fsck: shredcopter: "this" is pointing to DOMWindow (check console.log or your debugger)
21:42  josephsaliba: what shoud I use?
21:42  ambackstrom|fsck: shredcopter: http://jsfiddle.net/gtarM/
