00:08  BinaryKitten: you make the request to a local point
00:08  Mafia: coldhead ?
00:08  BinaryKitten: that local point then makes the actual request and returns the data
00:08  Mr_Nobody: BinaryKitten: but a proxy have to be on the same domain right?
00:09 --- rwaldron sets modes [#jquery +o ajpiano]
00:09  BinaryKitten: you make a request to a local (same domain) resourc
00:09 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 106 seconds
00:09  BinaryKitten: that resource then makes the external request and gives you back the result
00:10  Mr_Nobody: Yes, im familiar with this method.
00:10  Mr_Nobody: But where im in need to use this, the platform does not allow any other code than js, html and css.
00:11  BinaryKitten: then you're going to have to stick with the more complicated methodologies or move to a different platform
00:12  jhilla: Does anyone know of an exsisting plug-in to scatter elements randomly on a page?
00:12  Mr_Nobody: BinaryKitten: Ok, ajpiano suggested document.domain, since its possible to create subdomains. or would that be to risky?
00:12  Mr_Nobody: too*
00:12  Mafia: coldhead is not anything better?
00:13  JBar_: how does one change a 'droppable disable option: false' after a draggable item has been dropped on?
00:13  Mr_Nobody: BinaryKitten: Prob dumb questions, it depends on whats on the subdomain
00:13  danheberden: .css({ 'top': Math.rand() * $window.height, 'left' : Math.rand() * $window.width() }); @ jhilla  ?
00:14  BinaryKitten: Mr_Nobody i don't know and would bow to ajpiano's knowledge..
00:14 @ajpiano: and i'd defer to alex :)
00:15  Tomashe: i noticed that with animate there is a bit ease at the end
00:15  BinaryKitten: who would look to paul?
00:15  Tomashe: there is a way to disable this ?
00:15  Mr_Nobody: irish
00:15  BinaryKitten: yeah that antipattern guy
00:15  Mafia: anyone knows what it is used at markup.io ? to draw?
00:15  Mr_Nobody: was mentioned in the screencast about cross-domains i just watched :)
00:17  jhilla: danheberden: I should have been more specific.  I want then randomly scattered, but as non overlapping as possible.  What you wrote works, but they tend to clump a little.
00:17  danheberden: $.fn.kittylitter
00:18 @ajpiano: danheberden, please generate true randomness pls
00:18  danheberden: $.fn.danheberden
00:18  danheberden: DONE
00:18  BinaryKitten: $.fn.hell('getAGrip');

00:21  Neo--: guys, if I have an element (div) with various nodes in it (h1, p, and plain text), is there a way to get plain text as nodes as well (elem.children() doesn't show text as node), although it could since IIRC, plain text is still considered a text node
00:21  primepie: is it possible to know the inner element that the mouse is over ?
00:21 @ajpiano: ?contents @ Neo--
00:21  bot-t: Neo--, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
00:22  Tomashe: what is no easing property?
00:22  Neo--: ajpiano, wow, thanks, totally overlooked that one
00:22  Mafia: anyone knows what it is used at markup.io ? to draw?
00:22  BinaryKitten: Mafia have you tried looking at the source code?
00:23  Mafia: mmm cant recognize it
00:23  stuffmc: hi folks
00:23  BinaryKitten: because if i was to find out for you.. that is pretty much what I would do..
00:23  stuffmc: nobody at #css can answer this...
00:23  stuffmc: I realize it might be a CSS newbie question

00:33  BinaryKitten: that is the plugin
00:33  jhilla: If anyone is interested, here's what I've come up with so far, but they still tend to group depending on the size of the elements and their boinding boxes.

00:42  Aquaguy: I'm trying to hide a div element when it's focused out, but I want to avoid hiding it when a child of this element is focused, how can I achieve this?
00:45  bartmax: hi
00:51  jrockjiggz: Aquaguy: if you find out let me know
00:53  `Peter`: Been struggling with this one for a while, how can I take an example like this - <div id="test">Hell<b>o</b>!<div id="test2">Hi</div></div>
00:53 --- Gercek_ is now known as Gercek
00:53  `Peter`: and JUST get the "Hello!" text
00:53  `Peter`: without the child div
00:53  JBar_: can anyone point me in the right direction. looking to prevent 2 draggable items from occupying single droppable area.
00:54  JBar_: disable: true would work on drop: function
00:54  JBar_: not sure how to write event..
00:54  jrockjiggz: $('#test').not('#test2').text();
00:55  `Peter`: jrockjiggz : I won't necessarily know any details about the child div
00:55  `Peter`: and there may be more than one of them
00:55  `Peter`: but they'd always be below the text I want
00:55  jrockjiggz: ic
00:57  `Peter`: I don't really get why $("#test").not("div").text(); doesn't work
00:57  BinaryKitten: because #text is a div
00:57  BinaryKitten: you're saying get me item with id #test that's not a div
00:57  BinaryKitten: and get the text from within it
00:57  `Peter`: alright
00:57  `Peter`: but in theory then
00:57  `Peter`: $("#test").children().not("div").text();
00:57  `Peter`: should work
00:58  BinaryKitten: in theory
00:58  `Peter`: but it doesn't - it just returns everything before the opening <b> tag
00:58  `Peter`: which I don't get
00:58 --- c4rl-afk is now known as c4rl
00:58  `Peter`: well, everything in the <b> tags actually
00:58  `Peter`: when in reality I want all of that text
00:59  `Peter`: I thought that even text like that should be counted as a child node
00:59  `Peter`: but $("#test").children().first().html() only returns "o"
01:01  ocf: returning 1.3 million records daily to my db, one field is 'thumbnail' - its a hot link to the image on the source server (e.g. twimg01 = twitter's image server). I believe best practice would be to cache this image instead of hot linking. But caching 1.3 million images per day? capturing 180 days worth of data? That's 2.34 billion images stored on my server? yikes

01:11  ocf: they've provided me with a list of 450 keywords that I need to collect data for, and currently I'm collecting 60k records/hr
01:11  ocf: this is a filterable/searchable list, so theoretically somebody could want to view a twitter post from day 146, and the UI requirements state I need to display that twitter users thumbnail img
01:11  ocf: or a youtube thumbnail
01:12  ocf: I did the math on this - I grabbed a few thumbnails that averaged around 2.2 kb/per... thats 500 gb of thumbnails on my server when I hit 6 months of data
01:13  semaphore: that's quite the requirement
01:13  ocf: well it won't be on my server indefinitely
01:13  sone: Does anyone know how to add checkboxes to indicate selected rows for jqGrid? I cant seem to find any examples anywhere
01:13  semaphore: a thumbnail of their twitter page, twitter avatar or something else?
01:14  ocf: avatar
01:14  ocf: facebook prof pic
01:14  ocf: youtube thumbnail
01:14  ocf: flickr thumbnail
01:14  semaphore: at the time, not the current one
01:14  ocf: ah, I don't think that's relavent
01:14  ocf: could be either
01:14  semaphore: because you could use apis to get the current one, and not need to store ot
01:14  semaphore: er, it
01:15  ocf: but that's still going to be an HTTP request right?
01:15  coldhead: my precious ops
01:15  semaphore: yep
01:15  ocf: so storing just the link is going to be more performant for the db
01:15  ocf: yslow/firebug says I'm making 15 dns lookups per page refresh
01:15  ocf: to hit all of the twitter/facebook/youtube/flickr img servers
01:16  ocf: and that's just ugly (it graded me E on an A-F scale :(  )
01:16  semaphore: accumulate them with image magik;10x10 , and make one request and sprite them
01:18  ocf: so given the ability of a user to pull up nearly unlimited combinations of 50 records on a page, I'd have to do this dynamically. Can that be done with image magik? Aggregate 50 sources (passed in a single HTTP request), return a sprite, and then display properly? That seems far fetched
01:19  ocf: I can certainly build a.. say.. json string that contains all of the thumbnail URLs
01:20  semaphore: you could send json post and get back a sprite of images, let the server do the work
01:20  semaphore: with lots of images, i don't think firebug will ever approve of that
01:20  semaphore: it's just offloading requests from the client to the server;
01:22 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
01:22  ocf: cool i'll take a look at it
01:22  ocf: if it can take json & I can load my page in sub 3 seconds, I'll give it a whirl
01:23  semaphore: it would depend on how fast the server can fire off all those image requests at once and assemble it
01:23  semaphore: you wouldn't need imagemagik, i think php/gd could do it too
01:23  ocf: man I've done a lot of crazy shit for this project :)
01:23  primepie: if an element and its children have mouseover events.. how can I catch the child's mouseover event before the parent catches it ?

02:10  bartmax: RTPMatt: maybe... let me try
02:10  bartmax: ner0x: it should
02:10  ner0x: bartmax: Serialize still picks it up.

02:11  bartmax: mm RTPMatt is there a way to get all elements with the same data-time without specifing the value of data-time ?
02:12  RTPMatt: just [data-time] ?
02:12  RTPMatt: er, that gives all of them

02:34  mortana: when using onkeypress
02:34  mortana: but at the stage of onkeypress
02:34  mortana: the key isn't yet performed on the input box
02:35  mortana: so the value stays null
02:37  JBar_: how to write multiple events?
02:39  RTPMatt: mortana: ej, you could check that $(txt).val() + String.fromCharCode(e.charCode) is valid, if that is that kind of thing you are in to
02:41  mortana: RTPMatt: Thanks, this is getting close, besides the backspace not working
02:42  RTPMatt: just alwasy cound backspace a a valid char

05:19  SpinachHead: does $(input).val() return and empty string or null or what? when the  input is left blank?
05:19  emanu: my .delegate('load', function() {} ) doesn't seem to work...
05:20  danheberden: emanu: load events dont bubble
05:20  danheberden: they dont even simmer
05:20  danheberden: they just kinda sit there
05:20  emanu: danheberden: aaah, ok. So how do I bind to it?
05:20  danheberden: hmmm
05:20  danheberden: if only there was a function
05:20  danheberden: to bind thing

05:20  danheberden: ah it works!
05:21  iszak: danheberden, I know that.
05:22  emanu: danheberden: but .bind() doesn't work either. I basically have a div that's created when I click a button

05:22  emanu: I tried .live() and .delegate(), but both don't work.
05:24  emanu: the problem is that I have a div #mygrid, that contains a table. When I click on a link, the contents of #mygrid get replaced with a form, and in that form is a div #status that I want to fade in
05:24  emanu: so when I click and reload the contents of that #mygrid div, I can't seem to bind to the #status div that gets created...
05:24  danheberden: emanu: so, like, if you're in the process of creating it
05:25  danheberden: why not just execute your fades when you're done?
05:25  zbrown: Is there a way for me to check if a particular class is applied to an element? i.e. I want to know if "selected" is applied

05:40  letterpress: yeah that worked
05:40  letterpress: not elegant, but it did the trick.
05:40  danheberden: letterpress, also using attr to get it won't coerce
05:41  letterpress: ah thx ok good to know
05:41  danheberden: but then, that would probably get cooerced
05:41  danheberden: hmm
05:41  danheberden: lemme know if you try it
05:41  danheberden: i know "true" and "false" get coerced

06:17  danheberden: which the drop would do

06:18  Jbar: danhenberden: no.  only 1 can occupy the space at a time.  1 moves in, 2 cant (hence droppable: false)
06:18  Jbar: 1 moves out, droppable: true
06:19  Jbar: 2 can move in
06:19  Jbar: pretty much, on an off
06:19  danheberden: i think you're gonna have to track more/ do more to get that kind of functionality
06:19  danheberden: cuz out fires everytime the element leaves the bounds of the draggable
06:19  danheberden: period

06:20  Jbar: not positive
06:20  danheberden: you disabled it on drop
06:20  Jbar: correct
06:20  danheberden: you should try returning false on drag

06:20  danheberden: or drop
06:21  danheberden: like, on drop check if there's an element in the droppable
06:21  danheberden: if there is, then return false
06:21  danheberden: otherwise, let the drop happen (by drop, i mean the drop of ransom money to get timmy back)
06:22  Jbar: how can I conduct that?

06:41  danheberden: Jbar - looks like you got it working?
06:41 @ajpiano:  Jbar, i think the problem is that the "out" handler is never firing
06:41  Jbar: danheberden: no http://jsfiddle.net/jbarbeau/2USCm/22/
06:41 @ajpiano: because you never are able to actually take the draggable out of the droppable
06:42  Zxurian: this, still looking through other plugins to figurei tout
06:42  Jbar: drag 1 to A
06:42  Jbar: then 2 to A
06:42  Jbar: thats what I want
06:42  Jbar: cant occupy same space
06:42  Jbar: drag 1 to 2
06:42 @ajpiano: Jbar: the out handler is only fired when the draggable has been dragged out of hte droppble and dropped somewhere else
06:42  Jbar: not drag 2 to A
06:42  danheberden: ajpiano: not even on dropped
06:43  Jbar: *now
06:43  danheberden: once it passes out of bounds (whilst dragging)
06:43 @ajpiano: hmm
06:43 @ajpiano: well i can't get the 'out' handler to fire in this example
06:43  Jbar: recap: 1 to A, 2 to A (cant happen); 1 to 2, 2 to A, (doesnt work, but how I want it to work)
06:44  qq99: hey, if someone could have a look at: http://anthonycameron.com/personal/index.html -- I was wondering what the best way to pass data to js would be s.t. you might link someone to the page with and it would load with a set of tabs opened.. maybe index.html#about#contact for example loading with those tabs opened? or is that a bad idea?

06:46  kindlebit: danheberden:can i use $(".mailSend").this.click(function(){?
06:47 @ajpiano: Jbar: you understand that by DISABLING the droppable
06:47 @ajpiano: you prevent it from firing any events
06:48 @ajpiano: which means that when you attempt to drag the thing out of it
06:48  Jbar: no, I did not
06:48 @ajpiano: the 'out' event never fires

06:50  Jbar: I'll see what I can come up with
06:54 @ajpiano: Jbar: i think i have an idea
06:54  Jbar: ok
06:57 @ajpiano: Jbar: why are you using the revert:"invalid" option
06:58 @ajpiano: kind of makes it hard to ever pull something out of the draggable
06:58  Jbar: ajpiano: eventually this is going to be a 5x3 (75x75) grid
06:59  Jbar: ajpiano: so my images never overlap
07:00  Jbar: ajpiano: so, i need them to snap back if they arent in a valid spot
07:06  Jbar: ajpiano:can we use the accept option and two group 'all' and 'none'

11:27  basicgeek: hello all
11:27  ColdKeyboard: Is there a way to take a screenshot of a page with jquery?
11:27  Vorspire: yea, because the function has a call to itself inside of its own scope, you need to create a buffer function
11:28  basicgeek: I am building a new version of my issue tracking app ( www.naphtaline.net ), and I'd like to move to an ajax intensive webapp
11:29  basicgeek: since I already used jquery for dom manipulation and ajax queries, I'd like to stick with it. However, since the app goes way beyond basic selection/manipulation, I'd like to know whether there are guidelines to organise code in order to ensure easier maintenance
11:29  FLX99: Vorspire: can you give me an example on that? because this is getting confusing :P
11:30  Vorspire: FLX99; var foo = function(){ foo(); }; //too much recursion
11:30  alaing: Hi does anyone know if js has like an "in" clause like a sql statement could have select * from tbl where id in(1,2,3,4,7)
11:30  ColdKeyboard: Is there a way I could take the 'look' of the current page user is viewing and save it to some var o pass it to PHP to make an image of it?
11:30  FLX99: no Vorspire, i meant on fixing that error
11:30  Vorspire: FLX99; var foo = function(){ bar(); }; var bar = function(){ foo(); }; foo(); //fine
11:31  Vorspire: oh
11:31  FLX99: right
11:31  FLX99: thanks dude
11:31  Dracos__: alaing: SQL's in clause is basically a shorthand for a bunch of logical OR operators
11:31  alaing: Coldkey hmm good question. I recon you could
11:31  Dracos__: besides, SQL is a 4th gen language, js is not
11:32  Dracos__: ColdKeyboard: you essentially want to tkae a screenshot?
11:33  FLX99: Vorspire, call me stupid but this doesn't work: http://paste.enzotools.org/show/1437/
11:33  alaing: Dracos__: I figured that but jus thought I would put it out there. I'm trying to search to see if a users has checked a value in a list of checkboxs and I have quiet of few $.inArray(val,arr)
11:33  Vorspire: O_o
11:33  Dracos__: you'll have to loop over them
11:36  alaing: thanks my code is working I''m just trying to find a way to speed it up as IE is complainging about that the script is taking long
11:37  FLX99: i'm already looping over it
11:37  FLX99: $(this).animate({ backgroundColor: color }, 100,foo());
11:38  alaing: another question is there a way i can change the mouse pointer when a user selects an option from a select list. this then runs through some code once its finished to set it back to a pointer
11:38 --- BarryCarlyon_ is now known as BarryCarlyon
11:38  alaing: ColdKeyboard: something like $('body').html() then you send that back to the server or could even use a ajax call.
11:39  ColdKeyboard: alaing: How can I use that to generate PNG or JPG image?
11:39  alaing: ColdKeyboard: the tricky bit would be trying to inject the css and html together to make an image. why do you need an image you could just store it as html and output it. is this for like a helpdesk application
11:39  Dracos__: ypou can't, unless there's a way to copt the rendered page to a canvas
11:40  Dracos__: *copy
11:40  alaing: ColdKeyboard: might be worth asking in #php as well
11:40  Dracos__: nah, this is entirely a client side thing

12:01  FLX99: awesome, thanks Vorspire!
12:01  sean`: I like it
12:01  sean`: <3
12:01  Vorspire: so you can omit the list of colors and it will always be random :P
12:01  ColdKeyboard: Is there a way to capture screenshot with jQuery and pass it to php or save it on server?
12:01  FLX99: Vorspire: maybe you know why the color change callback does work on http://denniskromhoutvandermeer.com/atlassian/livetwitter/ but not on http://denniskromhoutvandermeer.com/atlassian/twitter/
12:02  fr34k: claudio, ya but it wont work
12:02  FLX99: it complains that "fx.start is undefined", but there is virtually no difference between the two pages in that respect
12:02  sean`: atlassian
12:02  sean`: :O

12:03  Vorspire: FLX99; sorry, i don't know :(
12:04  claudio: fr34k, probably because the img has to fully loaded, first
12:04  Vorspire: FLX99; but i just added more support to that demo lol
12:04  Vorspire: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/5jtc2/
12:04  claudio: fr34k, so, you have to resize it AFTER it has been loaded (hint: .load() event on the image)
12:04  Vorspire: now if you specify a list of colors and one is "random" it will generate a random color at that point

12:11  mheap: I tried that, said it wasn't defined
12:12  Vorspire: try this; var obj = null; obj = { ... }

12:14  fr34k: :/
12:15  claudio: fr34k, that is wrong on many levels.
12:15  Vorspire: fr34k, after you use .find, use .each

Am wondering if this is the right way to do it, since i need it to send a new request each time the person choses a new option in the dropdown.. how can i achieve this?
12:22  Vorspire: fr34k; you should set up the code something like this; http://pastebin.com/WyP7GsFk
12:22  Dracos__: handling a key event or a mouse event would generate too many concurrent requests
12:23  Dracos__: so yes, change is the right event
12:23  Vorspire: if change will work with that element yes, otherwise try blur

12:27  Vorspire: then .val() :P
12:27  mrHat: ha
12:27  mrHat: nice:)
12:27  Vorspire: but that selection will select all inputs starting with id_ not a singleton
12:28  mrHat: i dont even want to think the code you need to write without jquery
12:28  Vorspire: lol
12:28  mrHat: Vorspire so if i have more then 1 input starting with id_ what happens
12:28  mrHat: returns an array of values ?
12:29  mrHat: $('input[id^="id_"]').val() ?
12:29  Vorspire: you get a list of elements from the selection instead of one, but .val() will always return the first element's value
12:30  mrHat: but the list its an array
12:30  mrHat: right ?
12:30  Vorspire: a jQuery object

13:27  Nomikos: anli_: if you're using utf8, there's only like 5 characters you need to find/replace I think? I'd use a little string wrapper thinger
13:27  mekwall: Avalarion: it's not a one-string hint... and I'm not sure I'm getting you right anyway, so if you run off to jsfiddle.net and setup the html structure, then I'll be able to help

I use the superfish plugin to create nice menues, but in Chrome, whenever I open a <select>, the first menu item expands as well. It is located in the top left corner of the window. I can stop chrome from doing it, by not having 'body { margin: 0; }', but that doesn't make any sense. Any ideas?

14:06  Zxurian: so i'm attempting to rewrite the jCarouselLite plugin to allow for certain methods that I need, but I have a feeling that I'm mixing up the namespace in some areas. - http://pastebin.com/UqnqLprF - is it possible for someone to give a quick look through and see if i'm doing anything bad in terms of proper jQuery?
14:07  mekwall: Zxurian: where are your changes?
14:08  Zxurian: the original plugin had no methods
14:08  mekwall: Zxurian: so var methods is your creation?
14:08  Zxurian: so... I moved all of the funtions out of the original "return this.each(function() {" from line 300 into the area just below the declaration
14:08  Zxurian: er... below (function($) {
14:09  Zxurian: yea
14:09  Zxurian: I followed the Plugins/Authoring page from jquery.com
14:09  Zxurian: the only problems I have are that I seem to have broken the ability to have two instances running at the same time
14:09  mekwall: $.extend ( o, options ); ---> o = $.extend({}, o, options) :)
14:10  Zxurian: if I make that change mekwall, the script breaks with "missing ) after argument list" on that line
14:11  mekwall: uh?
14:11  mekwall: how can it be missing a ) ? :D
14:11  mekwall: you did add the semicolon yes?
14:11  Zxurian: doh, didn't see the second comma there
14:11  Zxurian: one sec
14:11  Vorspire: var opt = $.extend(true, defaults, options);
14:12  mekwall: Vorspire: not if opt was already defined
14:12  Zxurian: okay, new problem. Making that change looses all of the options that were sent when called from DOMready
14:12  Vorspire: well opt is not usually defined if i just declared it with var, lol
14:13  webgeek: I am noticing in the documentation that <script>with no $(document).ready(function(){ });</script> being used. Do we still need to use it ?
14:13  mekwall: Zxurian: well... you only have one options for all elements, which means that if you init more elements they will all share the same options
14:13  sean`: doonie, http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/1249291/8c636e5e/even_mijn_kamermaat_laten_schrikken.html
14:13  sean`: rofl
14:13  mekwall: sean`banan!
14:13 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:14  Zxurian: i kind've thought that might be the case. so If i wanted to keep the options separate between multiple instance calls, where should i move the declaration calls to?
14:14  Zxurian: inside the return "this.each(function() {" for the individual methods?
14:15  mekwall: sean`: hahaa
14:15  mekwall: best reaction
14:15  mekwall: printer through the window is the shit
14:15  doonie: sean` lolz ;D idiot student
14:15  pallet: You know when you have some php in a jquery function for example 		jQuery("#statcontent").load("/components/com_osemsc/views/member/tmpl/statspages.php?<?php echo 'sealid='.$sealuserid; ?>&page=" + this.id, hideLoader);
14:15  sean`: ui[
14:15  sean`: yup
14:15  Vorspire: webgeek, the short-hand for doc.ready is: $(function() { ... });
14:15  doonie: sean` tweet it :D
14:16  pallet: this is working because the jquery function is in the .php page, but I need to move the function to its own fiel
14:16  pallet: how can I pass that variable from the php to .js file
14:16  pallet: ?
14:17  sean`: doonie, done
14:18  jaredquinn: pallet: say you're loading your content on click of an A tag.  You could have an onclick that did  jQuery('#statcontent').load($(this).attr('href'), hideLoader) for instance.
14:18  mekwall: pallet: use a function?
14:19  pallet: mekwall,
14:19  pallet: I kinda was
14:19  pallet: but I've just realised a better way,
14:19  pallet: thanks
14:20  mekwall: pallet: var loadStatsFile = function(sealid) { jQuery("#statcontent").load("/components/com_osemsc/views/member/tmpl/statspages.php?sealid="+sealid+"&page=" + this.id, hideLoader); };
14:20  pallet: I think sometimes if you just ask a question out loud it actually give you time a space to think about it yourself
14:20  pallet: mekwall, AWESOME
14:20  mekwall: then call loadStatsFile(<?php echo $sealuserid; ?>); from your php file
14:20  doonie: sean` now ill retweet! and only you will see it again :D
14:20  pallet: thanks
14:20  mekwall: pallet: never do like you did previously ;)
14:21  sean`: :P
14:21  mekwall: pallet: with your previous method, if for some reason sealuserid is not set, javascript will not throw an error
14:21  mekwall: pallet: so it will be much harder to debug
14:21  pallet: yeh, thanks
14:22  doonie: sean` ffs spoiler alert :P
14:23  Zxurian: thanks for the help by the way, are functions / variables I put underneath (function($) {  available to jQuery entirely, or just within the plugin that I write?
14:24  mekwall: Zxurian: you can take a look at a plugin of mine
14:24  mekwall: to give you some ideas
14:24  mekwall: <?php echo 'sealid='.$sealuserid; ?>

14:29  doonie: why
14:29  Dracos__: and it's not alleged rape
14:29  mekwall: because I don't believe he is a rapist
14:30  doonie: why
14:30  Dracos__: it's some invented swedish crime about whether a condom was used
14:30  mekwall: Dracos__: hehe, that's not actually the case though

14:53  alaing: I ran through jsonlint.com and it recons my json is valid

14:56  alaing: i'm really confused how can my json be incorrect if jsonlint.com is saying its valid
14:56  feesh: are extensions such as autocomplete on topic in here?
14:56  Vorspire: couldnt find any toastable products so you'll have to do with a pepsi
14:56  Vorspire: feesh; nothing here is ever on topic :D
14:56  feesh: (my autocomplete keeps submitting when I select an options from the dropdown list, even when autoSubmit is set to false)
14:56 * alaing puts his pepsi can in the microwave
14:56  mekwall: alaing: possibly because of encoding?
14:56  Vorspire: well, rarely
14:56  feesh: Vorspire: that's nice to know :O
14:57  mekwall: alaing: make sure you aren't responding in UTF-8 with BOM
14:57  Vorspire: autocomplete is often discussed though
14:57  alaing: mekwall: ok you lost me
14:57  Vorspire: Blessing Of Might xD
14:57  feesh: well I'm experiencing form submits when I hit return to make a selection, the code in the javascript doesn't appear to be getting fired though
14:58  feesh: so is there a way of preventing form submissions on key presses?
14:58  mekwall: ?g UTF-8 BOM
14:58  bot-t: mekwall, FAQ - UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 & BOM - http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html
14:58  mekwall: ^--- alaing
14:58  feesh: would I need to attach a key listener on the form or something?
14:58  alaing: I'm using firebug and debug the script
14:58  mekwall: if using utf-8, do it without bom :)
14:58  erichynds: feesh, bind keypress and listen if event.which === 13
14:58  mekwall: alaing: yes, and the encoding you use when you respond... is it utf-8?
14:58  erichynds: if so, preventDefault
14:59  feesh: $(
14:59  edbaffei: http://dpaste.com/286972// .. hi guys.. how is something like this achieved
14:59  Vorspire: does event.which always work? can't remember which of the key events don't support the enter key i which, alternatively use event.keyCode if i remember right
14:59  feesh: :$ stupid #... $("#frmData").keypress = function(e)? that valid jquery?
15:00  alaing: mekwall: I'm not sure
15:00  feesh: Vorspire: I guess I can just check both really
15:00  erichynds: use event.which
15:00  erichynds: it's normalized
15:00  feesh: oki doki
15:00  erichynds: event.keyCode or event.charCode don't always work
15:00  mekwall: feesh:  $("#frmData").keypress(function(e){ /* .. */ });
15:00  alaing: i know i have another similiar function where i return a string from the server and parse it through $.parseJSON
15:00  Vorspire: ahh yea, i'm getting them visa-versa'd lol
15:00  feesh: mekwall: cheers
15:01  alaing: and that works
15:01 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
15:02  feesh: hmm, this is making no sense :-/ I think the autocomplete is preventing default
15:03  feesh: rawr, the worst part is, the exact same code worked on another site :|
15:03  feesh: least so I thought I suppose
15:05  mekwall: alaing: well I had a similar problem... jslint validated my json, but my js-app said it was invalid
15:05  alaing: mekwall: could a single quote break the json?
15:06  erichynds: single quote is not valid json
15:06  mekwall: alaing: if used incorrectly, yes :)
15:06  mekwall: {"this":"is", "valid", "json"}
15:06  mekwall: {'this':'is','not':true}
15:06  alaing: so [{"data":"It's my first JSON object"}] woudl be incorrect?
15:06  mekwall: that should work
15:06  erichynds: jsonlint.com
15:07  mekwall: erichynds: he did that already :p
15:07  erichynds: and it still doesn't work?
15:07  mekwall: alaing: but depending on the encoding of the file that outputs that string
15:07  alaing: erichynds: I used that with the object in question and it said it was valid
15:07  mekwall: it can still break
15:07  sac_: jsonlint.com? :D
15:07  sac_: oh why
15:07  sac_: just generate json, don't write it yourself -> problem solved
15:08  alaing: sac_ boss wont listen lol
15:08  sac_: your boss insists on hand writing json?
15:08  mekwall: alaing: check the file that is outputting the string
15:09  alaing: its a pl/sql statement and he builds up the json for me too use.
15:09 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
15:09  mekwall: alaing: yes but there has to be a server-side file that is responding with it?
15:10  coachz: Can i pass my linktext and webdocumentid attributes in my onclick?   http://pastie.org/1379356
15:10  Vorspire: alaing; you could always use a json encoder to turn associative arrays into well formed json strings
15:10  mekwall: the encoding of that file might be UTF-8 with BOM
15:10  mekwall: if so, that's probably the culprit
15:10  alaing: let me check his code he maybe escaping the values
15:10  mekwall: "BOM use is optional, and, if used, should appear at the start of the text stream."
15:10  mekwall: that will break JSON :)
15:11  doonie: boom boom boom bom I want you in my doom
15:12  alaing: can carrage returns break it?
15:12  Vorspire: alaing, CL/RF ?
15:12  alaing: like a yeah
15:12  Vorspire: most likely
15:13  Vorspire: double escape \\n
15:14  alaing: that might explain it because when I console log it its a nicely formated sql string
15:14  mekwall: alaing: are you seeing ﻿ in the beginning of the string?
15:15  alaing: ??
15:15  mekwall: hehe I guess not
15:15  mekwall: ﻿ would be the ISO-8859-1 for the Byte Order Mark :)
15:16  alaing: how would I replace those cl/rf with /n?
15:16  mekwall: alaing: server-side? depends on the language
15:17  alaing: the bit of text I'm pulling back is a free form that users use to input their comments.
15:17  Vorspire: cr/lf (my bad)
15:17  alaing: oracle DB and pl/sql
15:17  Vorspire: Carriage return / Line Feeds
15:17  mekwall: uhm
15:17  mekwall: so it's perl?
15:17  alaing: could I know just do that with the string from the front-end
15:17  alaing: mekwall: no
15:17  Vorspire: \n \r is universal afaik
15:18  mekwall: not if you are passing it to $.ajax
15:18  mekwall: and use dataType: json :)
15:18  Vorspire: double-escape might work; \\n \\r
15:18  alaing: no i have my own ajax function that fetches the data
15:18  mekwall: and that's bad practice
15:18  mekwall: always format strings server-side
15:18  ironmagma: once I've assigned an anonymous function to, say, $(document).ready, is there some way I can access that function?
15:19  Vorspire: would javascript have native string functions if all formatting was supposed to be done server-side?
15:19  alaing: ironmagma: its anonymous for a reason just give it a name
15:19  beepbeep_: anyone have any idea why the checkbox in my site stays checked when I click it? http://jsfiddle.net/ymbnx/
15:19  mekwall: alaing: so you're saying you are getting the json directly from oracle? :)
15:20  feesh: so ... after some sherlocking, I've found that it submits the form after calling my callback function
15:20  alaing: mekwall: no I'm using ORACLE APEX and they have their own ajax API but it just returns strings
15:20  erichynds: ironmagma, var handler = function(){};  $(document).ready(handler);
15:20  feesh: function(value, data){ document.getElementById("membership_no").value = data; alert("BANG");  } anything in there that would make a form submit :-/
15:20  mekwall: alaing: I'm pretty sure that would return correctly formatted strings
15:21  alaing: ironmagma: $(document).ready(function(){//your functions you want to run})
15:21  feesh: maybe the alert is scaring it ...

15:22  Vorspire: feesh, put it on pastebin.com for me :)
15:22  ironmagma: all right this does not answer my question. what I want to know is if there is some way to access an anonymous function after it has been assigned to be an event handler, like so: $(document).ready(function(){ /* do some stuff */}); $(document).getHandler("ready"); // returns the anonymous function (pseudocode)
15:22  feesh: when I remove the // it submits
15:22  erichynds: ironmagma, var handler = function(){};  $(document).ready(handler);
15:23  erichynds: you can then access handler after it's been bound to an event
15:23  ironmagma: that doesn't do what I'm asking for. it's just an alternate solution to one problem, and not the problem I'm asking about.
15:23  beepbeep_: anyone have any idea why the checkbox in my site stays checked when I click it? http://jsfiddle.net/ymbnx/

15:23  RTPMatt: ironmagma: no you can't
15:24  erichynds: ironmagma, look in the element's .data("events") then
15:24  erichynds: where the handler is stored
15:24  Vorspire: ironmagma; then elaborate more on your problem istead o beating around the bush and people might be able to help more
15:24  erichynds: althought it's a huge pain in the ass and is certainly not an effective way to do whatever you're trying to do
15:24  Jonz: Ironmagma, you can trigger events http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
15:25  ironmagma: it's just a simple question, and deserves a yes/no answer. I find it hard to believe that there's no way to do it. erichynds: thanks

15:25  JAAulde: So I have some base code which uses $.ajaxSetup() to add some global settings to the ajax stuff. I have another script which is only inluded sometimes and when it is, it injects itself into the code base to take over where it should. However, this code also calls $.ajaxSetup() to put itself into place, and some of the properties collide causing them to be overwritten instead of augmented. Is there any way other than $.ajaxSetup() to work with t
15:25  JAAulde: he global settings in a more gentle way?

15:34  mekwall: feesh: with a button? :p
15:34  alaing: based in london but work from home near southend

15:34  mekwall: feesh: when?
15:34  feesh: when I hit return
15:34  mekwall: there's your problem :)
15:34  feesh: but, if the custom function isn't called, (still hitting return) the form doesn't submit
15:34  alaing: feesh all the reason to name and shame lol
15:35  mekwall: feesh: and return false didn't work?

15:35  feesh: mekwall: no

15:44  AdamDV: ysynopsis: Yea. I got it working now though.
15:45  freedgy: CFNinja: if you see it in view source, and can click-through and view the jquery library code - then its good to go.
15:47  CFNinja: That's what I thought. I'm fighting an odd problem. I've rolled the test server to the exact same revision as dev and the library shows in source however on production when I try to pull up a modal I get the error $("#genericmodal").dialog is not a function
15:47 --- alaing is now known as alaing_away
15:47  CFNinja: The exact same code on test works fine.
15:47 --- alaing_away is now known as alaing
15:47  CFNinja: I'm befuddled.
15:48  freedgy: does it work with jQuery('#gen...  instead of $(
15:48  freedgy: also, are you using .ready() ?
15:48  alaing: if i had a json object l_data = '[{"data": "1"}]' and then parsed it using myObj = $.parseJSON(l_data) how would get to the value 1?
15:48  CFNinja: I was going to go there next.
15:49  coachz: Can i pass my linktext and webdocumentid attributes in my onclick?   http://pastie.org/1379356
15:50  Vorspire: CFNinja, you want to detect if jQuery is installed and working or not?
15:50  claudio: coachz, you won't use "onclick" attribute anymore.
15:50  feesh: I think I know a way to work around this issue
15:51  feesh: it seems to be getting the return key down twice, the first time it fires, the selectedIndex is set to something other than -1, then by the time it receives the next press, it is -1 and so it doesn't prevent default then
15:51  coachz: claudio,  i'm working on a site that someone else wrote and if i use document ready then all the vars are not accessible outside it
15:52  feesh: fixed...
15:52  alaing: if i had a json object l_data = '[{"data": "1"}]' and then parsed it using myObj = $.parseJSON(l_data) how would get to the value 1?
15:52  feesh: that was a more productive hour
15:52  feesh: that's an array with a single value
15:52  feesh: well single object value
15:52  claudio: coachz, anyway, in a "onclick", the "this" refers to the element (as a DOM node, of course).
15:53  coachz: so how to pass the attribute value ?
15:53  claudio: coachz, this is #jquery, sorry
15:53  feesh: alaing: I'd guess $.parseJSON(l_data)[0].data

15:56  claudio: coachz, 1) my previous comment solves your issue 2) if you don't understand it, you should first clear up some basic JS stuff 3) your issue is not jquery related
15:56  claudio: so, what's that "jesus" about?

15:57  coachz: i thought so
15:58  coachz: jesus
15:58  Vorspire: coachz; i *think* (not sure) that you may still be able to access those vars inside document.ready by using the window reference; window['myFunc'](); //a function call for example

15:59  coachz: i'll try that claudio, thanks
15:59  CFNinja: Vorspire: yes, I need to know if jquery is actually functioning on a certain page.
15:59  Vorspire: ?installed
15:59  bot-t: To detect if jQuery itself is installed and active, you can test without errors using this snippet: if( !window["jQuery"] ){ /*Not Installed*/ }
15:59  Vorspire: just added that to bot-t :D
15:59  CFNinja: Vorspire: yes, jquery-ui is loaded too
16:00  coachz: i get undefined when i do   alert(this.webdocumentid);   after calling   onclick="fdbkprompt(this);
16:00  g0rd0n: i am using jquery/ajax to submit forms which works fine so far, but now i am stuck trying to get a file upload to work... did i miss something?
16:00  CFNinja: The only thing I can imagine is that maybe the production server has different firewall settings than test server and since jquery loads from google's cdn is having problems...however, if that were the case, I wouldn't see the jquery source code I'd see a 404.
16:01  coachz: same with  alert(this.webdocumentid.value);
16:01  Dracos__: g0rd0n: check your form/request encoding
16:01  g0rd0n: Dracos__: i am an idiot
16:01  Vorspire: CFNinja; seems like you've got yourself half-a-hole :P

16:25  dub54: Hi, I'm trying to modify some code so it doesn't use inline javascript. is $(this) (where this is a form object) the same as this.form ?
16:26  Clonix: its not what you want but... is maybe enough
16:26  Dracos__: form objects do not have form properties, their contained inputs do
16:26  dinosaadeh: Dracos__: I found some but none is working or the link is simply wrong
16:27  Jonz: dub54 $(this) is a jquery object, where the matching elements are.. probably your form

16:29  alaing: if i had $.parseJSON('[{}]') how do I test if its empty because the length would be 1
16:29  Jonz: dub54, for one thing you need <script> tags around your javascript code
16:30  dub54: Jonz: yes, I've got that..
16:31  Jonz: dub54, this is still pretty bad style but it just might work: http://pastebin.com/hWaJ6sTv
16:32  Jonz: what you really want to do is get away from functions like AddToCart that take an entire form as an input
16:32  Jonz: but i can't really get a sense of the whole system from this little paste
16:32  dub54: Jonz: sure, it's a shopping cart called Nopcart I've been asked to work with, not my choice
16:32  dub54: that worked, how comes $(this).parent() didn't work?
16:33  dub54: the input is inside the form

16:35  muhdik: do that on click?
16:35  hariom: depending upon the nature of the call (get vs post)
16:36  muhdik: whats the nature?

16:48  Panzen: can't belive no one is using tests...not using tests is very bad practice
16:49  alaing: Panzen: and practice makes perfect?
16:49  claudio: alaing, test directly the JSON string :)
16:49  alaing: how?
16:49  alaing: before i parse it?
16:50  claudio: right
16:50  claudio: if (data == "[{}]")
16:50  alaing: oh but of cause silly me :P
16:50  alaing: whats the point of parse if its empty object
16:50  RJ_: Please Help: I am using the jQuery UI slider $(".slider").slider({ this not working here });  I would like to get a reference to the selector within the slider method but "this" is not available, is there another way?
16:51  alaing: perhaps a hidden enhancement for future jquery versions
16:51  Panzen: alaing: no but any good developer who codes code that go in productive mode should/need use test scenarios...or he is not a good developer in my eyes
16:52  alaing: If you a good developer and you know what you doing then why test.....you shoudl be testing as your developing
16:52  nortocs: Panzen: and we all know how important it is to be a good developer in *your* eyes....
16:52  Panzen: ....in a project who more then 5 codders code its not possible...
16:52  alaing: Panzen: I do agree with you I wish we had more time for testing in our firm
16:53  nortocs: Panzen: Yeah, we use Test Driven here too... :)
16:53  nortocs: Panzen: Just kidding around with you...
16:54  alaing: unfortuantely we only a team of three that dev,test and release an applicaton with over 5000 users
16:54  alaing: on a monthly cycle
16:54  Hopsy: heyy alaing
16:54  claudio: RJ_, there is no "slider method". Do you mean the "slider options object"?
16:55  RJ_: yes, sorry
16:55  alaing: Hey Hopsy long time no see
16:55  Panzen: alaing: we release each week and with TDD you save so much time...
16:55  Panzen: you dont need "more" time for testing
16:55  claudio: RJ_, in that case, you can use directly the $('.slider')
16:55  alaing: Panzen: dam your dev team work around the clock?

16:56  alaing: TDD?
16:57  Panzen: alaing: lol, what do you do if you software has a bug? u need to find them and that is time consuming..with TDD (Test Driven Development) you give bug no chance ;)
16:57  nortocs: Panzen: we use JsUnit
16:58  alaing: Panzen when we have a bug we call bugbusters!!!
16:58  alaing: Panzen: its not hard to find stinkbugs in code
16:58  ipalaus: someone has experience using jQuery UI Dialog? I want to do something like I usually do with fancybox. I need to preview a images with a click and show it as a dialog, but with dialog() i need to first write it with HTML and then create a dialog in js foreach image. There is some way to do it with less code??
16:59  Panzen: alaing: your opinion....
16:59  claudio: RJ_, you can use .each()
16:59  alaing: Panzen: yeah I just mucking about....I see your point and like i said i wish we did more testing lol
17:00  claudio: RJ_, $('.slider').each(function() { $(this).slider({some options here, and you have your "this" too}) }
17:00  Panzen: alaing: then do it ;)
17:01  RJ_: thanks claudio, I will try that, I just was hoping I could get the selector some how
17:01  muhdik: what does # beofre a name mean in jquery?
17:01  alphaG: hi, i'm using the http://www.jeremymartin.name/projects.php?project=kwicks , kwicks like mootools for jquery... but i couldnt control the width of the whole thing (it supposed to calculate it based on the width of each LI element, but it doesnt take all the containing tag (div e.g) width...
17:01  alaing: Panzen: somethigns are out of ones control and I'm affraid thats one of them.
17:01  alaing: Hopsy: ?
17:02  Hopsy: yes?
17:02  Vorspire: muhdik; the # means that it should search for an ID
17:02  nortocs: muhdik: it means that the name refers to an ID as opposed to a class
17:02  muhdik: how do u search for a class?
17:02  Vorspire: like in CSS, # represents an ID and . represents a class
17:02  Hopsy: alaing: do you have experience with ollydbg?
17:03  Hopsy: i think i am gonna buy this book, http://www.amazon.com/OllyDbg-Lambert-M-Surhone/dp/6132076786
17:04  Hopsy: alaing: Yoeeehuuuu!!
17:04  muhdik: <div class="slick-cell c0 slick-cell-checkboxsel"><input type="checkbox"></div>
17:05  muhdik: how do i detect if the checkbox is clicked?
17:05  claudio: jquery is going too far ... muhdik should never be asked, in any javascript related channel/forum :(
17:05  muhdik: what was that?
17:05  claudio: muhdik, a thought
17:05  alaing: nope but it sounds like some karma sutra for debugger
17:05  muhdik: well i am useing slickgrid
17:05  Hopsy: ?g karma sutra
17:05  bot-t: Hopsy, Kama Sutra - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_Sutra
17:06  muhdik: anyway i need to see how to detect if the checkbox from the above html snippet is clicked?
17:06  muhdik: or unchecked
17:06  fdsdf: gdhd
17:06  muhdik: from
17:06  muhdik: <div class="slick-cell c0 slick-cell-checkboxsel"><input type="checkbox"></div>
17:06  alaing: muhdik: $('something').is(':checked')
17:07  muhdik: how do i detect input type checkbox within div with class slick-cell
17:08  dinosaadeh: guys any jquery to animate from one class to another? I still believe there must be one out there
17:08  Hopsy: omg alaing
17:08  Hopsy: nevermind

17:09  diago: ha, or that
17:09  alaing: Hopsy: what?
17:09  alaing: Hopsy: i should have warned about the content lol :P
17:10  alaing: Hopsy: never heard of it sounds quiet cool though
17:12  shadowhand: i have a strange issue when using .replaceWith()
17:12  shadowhand: heres the demo http://demo.naturefreshmilk.com/pages/zone/7
17:13  JAAulde: I'm sure I know the answer to this question, but I want to ask to be sure...does the browser JS model provide access to the response headers which came back with the current loaded page? (I am not talking AJAX, here)
17:13  JAAulde: hi shadowhand
17:13  shadowhand: now, when you click Save in the form, it will show you some errors
17:13  shadowhand: when you click the "nevermind" link, it should reset the form
17:13  elb0w: How do I do continue; inside of $.each?
17:13  shadowhand: but you have to  click it twice
17:13  shadowhand: elb0w: return;
17:13  elb0w: return would end it no?
17:13  shadowhand: elb0w: only for the current loop
17:14  elb0w: I just want to go to the next iteration
17:14  shadowhand: elb0w: the function executes once per item in collection
17:14  dinosaadeh: Vorspire: I am trying it but it is not working =(
17:14  elb0w: oh
17:14  shadowhand: so if you return; it will jump to the next iteration
17:14  elb0w: ty
17:14  elb0w: gotcha
17:14  shadowhand: JAAulde: sorry, hi
17:15  shadowhand: anyways
17:15 --- alaing is now known as alaing_away
17:15  JAAulde: s'ok
17:15  claudio: JAAulde, I really don't think so. *Which* response header, anyway?
17:15  JAAulde: claudio: I have a custom X- header
17:15  Vorspire: return will return, continue will break to the next itteration
17:15  shadowhand: does anyone have an idea why my .live('click') has to activate twice to work?
17:15  JAAulde: and, claudio, I also really don't think so
17:15  claudio: JAAulde, so JS should access the http header of the page it resides into
17:16 --- ecurtis|away is now known as ecurtis
17:16  JAAulde: claudio: I don't understand what you said
17:16  claudio: JAAulde, I mean, your X- header is served upon the "main" page request, right?
17:17  laurenty: any experts on jqueryui tabs widget?
17:17  claudio: the, say, index.php one
17:17  JAAulde: claudio: yes, actually, all page requests. I have the AJAX ones taken care of and was hoping for a simple solution for the "main" page load
17:18  JAAulde: I have a solution for the main load, but it is a little more complex and I was hoping for simplicity
17:18  Forbidd3n: Anyone know where I can find a jquery plugin that can show webstats for pages visited like this one? -- http://enstyled.com/adminus/original/page.html (the one on the main page)
17:18  claudio: JAAulde, anyway, none that I can't think of.
17:18  JAAulde: claudio: cool, thanks
17:18  Forbidd3n: Like the Per Days or Per Months (Line or Bar Graph)
17:19  claudio: JAAulde, a window.request object would be cool :)
17:19  claudio: sorry. window.response
17:19  Forbidd3n: Basically, I am trying to find a good jquery bar and line graph plugin.
17:19  sean`: Forbidd3n, jqplot
17:20  Forbidd3n: thanks
17:20  JAAulde: claudio: yes, it would be fantastic
17:22  shadowhand: anyone?
17:23  shadowhand: my replacement is form.replaceWith(create.clone()); form = $('#cropper form');
17:23  qq99: Is there some kind of pre-req needed to make the window scroll?  like $("body").scrollLeft += 10; doesn't seem to be working on my horz. page.  (trying to bind mousewheel to horz. scrollbar, but think my DOM might be messed or something)
17:24  qq99: it detects scroll, just doesn't move anything
17:24  shadowhand: qq99: i think you need to do that on $(window) not ('body')
17:24  janthony: If I want to add little navigation to the bottom of a rotator, i.e. have 4 circles, and the rotator you're on is the existing circle, is the cycle plugin easy to modify to do this, or should I just start from scratch?
17:25  shadowhand: qq99: and the syntax would be $(window).scrollLeft(amount)
17:25  janthony: Or, shoudl I look for another plugin that already does that?
17:27 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:27  janthony: I guess I could actually make that part of the dom.
17:27  qq99: shadowhand, thanks :) you just saved me a ton of time
17:28  qq99: shadowhand, it's working now
17:30  Forbidd3n: anyone know what jquery wysiwyg plugin this is - http://enstyled.com/adminus/original/page.html
17:30  Forbidd3n: or one that they could recommend that is the best wysiwyg editor
17:30  qq99: shadowhand, this works well, but is there any way to do a relative scrollLeft? as it stands, it can only go 1 time left, or 1 time right with mousewheel
17:31 --- ecurtis is now known as ecurtis|away
17:31  qq99: shadowhand, like scrollLeft(window.currscroll - delta)
17:31  qq99: or something
17:31  iEatChildren: im trying to show the next div after a button is clicked. For some reason the div is showing then hiding right away. I thought it wasnt working at all untill i put my results in an alert. when i did that i noticed while the alert was up the "next div" was being shown...but when i closed the alert that div was hidden again. can anyone explain what im doing wrong? http://pastebin.ca/2020458
17:33  m0n5t3r: Forbidd3n: source says it's http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jWYSIWYG
17:34  qq99: shadowhand, nvm, found it
17:35  Forbidd3n: m0n5t3r, what would you say is the best jquery wysiwyg editor?
17:35  Forbidd3n: or anyone for that matter
17:36  qq99: how can you have wysiwyg for code?
17:36  markj: he means wysiwyg editor for content I'm sure, but coded in jquery
17:36  qq99: ohh
17:37  Forbidd3n: there are many to choose from, just curious what others recommend
17:37  qq99: Forbidd3n, I'd almost recommend providing markdown syntax and no wysiwyg
17:37 --- unruthless_ is now known as unruthless
17:38  qq99: because I feel like most would turn your data into soup
17:38  qq99: or frustrate the user with loading/lag times
17:38  qq99: if people like the site enough, they'll learn markdown
17:39  iEatChildren: anyone have an idea why this code is not working? http://pastebin.ca/2020458
17:39 * m0n5t3r using wymeditor with markdown
17:39  Forbidd3n: not sure what you mean by "markdown"
17:39  shadowhand: i figured out my .live() issue... i was using a pre-selected jQuery object that was replaced at an earlier time and was no longer valid
17:39  qq99: stuff like "##header" is turned into "<h2>header</h2>" by server-side, tab is new paragraph, etc
17:40  shadowhand: doing a new selection on the form fixed it
17:40  qq99: check out bluecloth and the like for more examples
17:40  Forbidd3n: qq99: is there an editor that does the ##header stuff?
17:40  shadowhand: i prefer MarkItUp
17:41  qq99: like, user enters markdown, and sees a javascript preview underneath?
17:41  shadowhand: really clean, supports Markdown and other stuff
17:41  shadowhand: http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/examples/markdown/
17:42  qq99: yeah I'd go with something like that
17:42  Forbidd3n: shadowhand: so that would be a good markdown editor?
17:42  Forbidd3n: thanks
17:42  m0n5t3r: huh, my memory fails, I was actually using markitup :)
17:42  qq99: but when you serve it up, you need to convert it
17:42  shadowhand: quite true
17:43  Forbidd3n: shadowhand, qq99: is there a doc on what to convert on server-side?
17:43  shadowhand: it does not actually render markdown, only provides a little toolbar
17:43  shadowhand: Forbidd3n: what's your server side language?
17:43  shadowhand: php?
17:43  Forbidd3n: php
17:43  shadowhand: use PHP Markdown http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/
17:44  Forbidd3n: shadowhand: pretty simple learning curve?
17:45  qq99: I suppose you COULD submit the "compiled" version of the markdown'd txt if you don't wanna render it server side, but it makes it impossible for the user to ever edit that with markdown again
17:45  qq99: they'd then have to use html
17:45  shadowhand: Forbidd3n: include 'Markdown.php'; $html = Markdown($text);
17:45  shadowhand: yah, pretty simple
17:45  shadowhand: qq99: i prefer saving both the html and the text
17:45  Forbidd3n: shadowhand: gotcha, didn't know if there was more involved
17:46  Forbidd3n: shadowhand: so you save the default markdown and then convert the markdown and save both
17:46  shadowhand: qq99: then you don't have to re-render all the time, but you can still give the user a chance to edit
17:46  shadowhand: Forbidd3n: right
17:46  janthony: Does anyone know if it is possible to change the z-index on the cycle?
17:46  Forbidd3n: bring back the markdown original in the editor
17:46  Forbidd3n: and so on...
17:46  janthony: Er, the cycle plugin.
17:46  shadowhand: exactly
17:46  Forbidd3n: can they change the html with markdown?
17:46  janthony: Right now the cycle plugin is starting with a z-index of 2, and I need it to be 30 or higher.
17:47 --- HarryPitfall_ is now known as HarryPitfall
17:47  qq99: shadowhand, but that results in twice as much data transfer from user on submit, I'd rather render once on server and cache
17:47  shadowhand: qq99: sorry, i do render it on the server
17:47  digitalfiz: testing
17:47  shadowhand: not on the client side
17:47  Forbidd3n: qq99: how would you cache it
17:48  shadowhand: user only submits markdown text, then i render the html from the text and save both into the database
17:48  qq99: Forbidd3n, your table has the user submitted content, which is in markdown. on submit, I'd prob markdown(content) and store it in another column
17:48  qq99: and then if he edits the markdown'd content, you'd markdown(content) and update that field again
17:49  shadowhand: ding ding :)

17:49  qq99: safeguard him*
17:49  weedar: There's a site that still uses frames(!) and I'd like to change it so it uses div's instead - and that all links within such a "frame"-div loads the linked URL into its target div instead of to a frame-target. Does anyone have any comments on this idea?
17:49 --- sean` is now known as nlean
17:50  titii: Hey guys, I have a big problem, Why nothing dont work??? jQuery('todayhollyday-blocks').css('border','1px solid red');
17:50  qq99: Forbidd3n, the other option is app-level caching but I can't help you with that
17:50  titii: Is it wrong?
17:51  weedar: One "requisite" is that I could use a new jquery-index.php instead of the old frame-based index.php and use jquery to alter all <a>-tags on the fly so it would still be possible to use the old frame-based version if one was so inclined
17:51  qq99: titii, is that a class?
17:51  qq99: titii, you need '.todayhollyday-blocks'
17:51  qq99: titii, also, standard is $('.today...etc')
17:51  titii: qq99: no this is UID
17:51  titii: ID
17:51  qq99: then # instead of .
17:52  titii: qq99: ou, thanks
17:52  qq99: weedar, maybe iframes inside of positioned divs?
17:52  claudio: weedar, if the main purpose of the frame is to have a "sticky" navigation menu, you should also consider position: fixed
17:53  claudio: weedar, what you're thinking it's only apparently simple (think about the back button, or the bookmarking...)
