19:58  josephsaliba: hey guys ... what is the event when a user clicks on the enter key?
19:58  josephsaliba: i mean a user presses the enter key
19:59  timing: there is keyup, keydown and keypress
19:59  Jonz: keydown when they press down the key, keyup when they release it
19:59  timing: and in that event you have to check which key it is
19:59  Jonz: keypress on down then up
19:59  josephsaliba: ok i want keypress
19:59  josephsaliba: but how do i check which key is pressed?
20:00  Jonz: code = event.keyCode || event.which
20:00  timing: e.keyCode I think
20:00  timing: but just check the docs for it
20:00  timing: I think the enter key is 13
20:00  josephsaliba: I'll do :)
20:00  josephsaliba: thanks
20:00  Jonz: if you're using jquery UI, there are "constants" for it
20:00  Jonz: i.e., code == $.ui.keyCode.ENTER
20:03  innociv: What's the best way to add something to an array if it's not already in it?
20:04  Jonz: yourArray.push(newThing)
20:05  timing: and with indexOf you can check if the item is already there
20:05  Jonz: or yourArray.unshift(newThing) if you want it at the front
20:06  Jonz: there's no special jquery way to work with arrays, this is just pure js
20:06  josephsaliba: do u know the keyCode for "Esc" ?
20:07  Jonz: the jquery api page for event.which has a demo
20:07  Jonz: which you could use to answer that question
20:07  Jonz: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
20:12  Dr4g: Efficient way of having a counter count down from 60 -> to
20:12  Dr4g: (seconds)
20:13  Dr4g: setTimeout is decent enough or not ?
20:15  josephsaliba: i have this
20:15  josephsaliba: $('#upgradePromotionWindow').bind('keypress', function(e) {
20:15  josephsaliba: i'll put it on fiddle
20:15  Jonz: Dr4g, setTimeout is the only way to do a counter
20:16  Jonz: or setInterval
20:16  josephsaliba: http://www.jsfiddle.net/8LAuW/
20:16  josephsaliba: if i change the key to an enter it works
20:16  josephsaliba: now its set to escape
20:16  Jonz: Dr4g, i made a countdown plugin if you want to use it, it's not super great but gets the job done: https://github.com/macgyver/countdown
20:16  l4rk: or using web workers :)
20:17  l4rk: and loops
20:17  l4rk: i think those are the three only ways of doing a counter
20:17  aro: if you globally bind ajaxComplete - will that trigger before the calling ajax request or after?
20:18  Jonz: nver used it before, but Complete suggests to me that it will trigger once the response comes back
20:18  Dr4g: Jonz: thanks - example usage?
20:20  Jonz: Dr4g: http://brokendisk.com/code/countdown.html
20:21  KeeperOfTheSoul: is there a simple way to save/export/download some data client side using javascript?
20:22  Dr4g: Jonz: what' wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/FfR9wbwa
20:22  dabear: KeeperOfTheSoul: what do you mean? you can always post a form, or import json data with $.parseJSON
20:22  KeeperOfTheSoul: in this case using a remote server/local storage wouldn't work as its assuming the client has lost network connection
20:22  KeeperOfTheSoul: dabear: naw, I want to allow a user to save some data from a page locally when they've lost network connection
20:23  KeeperOfTheSoul: only they are entering data on one machine, then resume on another so local storage won't work, they need to be able to save the data to a usb-stick
20:24  KeeperOfTheSoul: its a sort of last resort thing
20:25  losing: does updating location.hash not push a new item on the navigation stack?
20:25  Phrogz_: losing: It does.
20:25  losing: kk
20:25  Dr4g: Jonz: i got it mate - had  to put my function outside of the jquery ready
20:25  losing: thnx
20:25  Jonz: coolio
20:26  KeeperOfTheSoul: I couldn't see any way of triggering a download locally though, just asking in case someone knew a way
20:26  ionas: maybe through some hack like an java/flash applet

20:38  KeeperOfTheSoul: aro: I think google had a nice way of handing that using an in-app message broker, so the widgets talk via the broker and command handlers then send the ajax request
20:38  KeeperOfTheSoul: aro: when the response comes back it is translated in to a message and submitted to the event broker again
20:39  ionas: KeeperOfTheSoul, silverlight wont be installed on osx, no idea about android, ios is closed to foreign vms anway
20:39  aro: hmm
20:39  l4rk: pretty sure i suggested ajaxSuccess before as well
20:39  KeeperOfTheSoul: ionas: hmm, not a bad idea, pop-up a window with the JSON or something in it and the user just does save as
20:39 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 90 seconds
20:39  l4rk: well its not in my lastlog so maybe not
20:40  ionas: no idea exactly, but the basic idea was to use the document "handler" that is already there (via File->Save)
20:40  KeeperOfTheSoul: ionas: well android, ios wouldn't be so bad since they are mobile they'd be the user's own device so they can just wait until they get a connection again, and until then there's local storage
20:40  ionas: you could use a popup and use copy+paste json
20:41  ionas: KeeperOfTheSoul, save editing forms on the server every x seconds and notify if no connection - next time they login they will get back to that state
20:41  KeeperOfTheSoul: aro: the idea came from this presentation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuhR18-EdM
20:41  pietia: lets say that i want to fire an _event_ when some div is updated (data in that div id refreshed). how can i "add" that event ?
20:41  ionas: battery gone
20:41  ionas: gtg home  - cu
20:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: ionas: yeah, but part of the idea is they should be able to continue whilst no connection is present, except then some users carry on completely oblivious to the warning (since most users don't read error messages)
20:43  dabear: pietia: you wanna listen to that event, or do you want to trigger it?
20:44  dabear: DOM mutation events, or see ?trigger
20:44  bot-t: .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/

20:46  dabear: listen to that
20:46  dabear: not supported in ie6-8
20:46  pietia: daemon, so maybe  i should just call javascript function in rendered html ?
20:47  dabear: dude, I am not daemon
20:47  sean`: lol
20:47  aro: damn
20:48  aro: it still lets the calling function get the response first
20:48  pietia: daemon, i know  :) but i have to support 'all' browsers
20:50  aro: this is a description of my problem: http://osdir.com/ml/jQuery/2009-03/msg02163.html
20:54  KeeperOfTheSoul: pietia: excellent, so let me know when the site is ready and we'll see how well it handles links ;)
20:54  pietia: KeeperOfTheSoul, ? :)
20:56  KeeperOfTheSoul: pietia: you said 'all' browsers
20:56  pietia: KeeperOfTheSoul, ah. linkS:)
20:56  pietia: sorry, links will be not supported - only lynx :P

21:15  Yan_Nick: Hey guys, how can I detect a link with regexp?
21:15  aro: so i was just wondering if there was a way to basically make them all go through a single function before they get to the calling functions
21:16  Jonz: yan_nick, definitely something you can google for
21:16  Yan_Nick: Jonz: but is there another way to detec links?
21:16  Yan_Nick: detect*
21:16  Jonz: not specific to javascript even, and especially not particular to jquery
21:17  Yan_Nick: If a user writes http://blabla in a text...

21:19  t33: hmm works, but still all alt texts appear on hover at once
21:19  t33: it works though for each
21:19  t33: alt
21:20  t33: i could try to nest the hover function int he each call right?
21:21  t33: not sure how to do it but i'd prob figure it out in time
21:21  aro: i need something to override the local callbacks
21:23  Hoe``: what's the simplest way to change "500px" to "500" ?
21:23  Hoe``: oh look at that, parseInt lol
21:27  rgl: is there anything that can bind a function to an object (eg. bind to "this")?
21:28  Hoe``: you mean like: var myObject = {}; myObject.foo = function() { } ?
21:29  Hoe``: I don't believe you can do it to this directly, but i believe you can do: var t = this; t.foo = function() { }
21:29  rgl: and then pass a function to other object (like, $.ajax({...., success: myobj.myfunc }) where its called with myobj as this.
21:29  Pilate: rgl: you may be looking for 'apply'
21:31  rgl: Pilate, I'm currently using apply manually like var self = this; $.ajax({
21:31  rgl: ..., success: function() { self.onBackupStarted.apply(self, arguments); } } ... but was wondering if this binding is already on jquery?
21:37  rgl: humm there is jQuery.proxy ... !

22:40  naturalethic: how might i derive a selector programatically given an element in a document
22:41  pifantastic: hmm
22:41  RomD: naturalethic: what are you trying to do?
22:42  naturalethic: searching for text in a document, when I have the element, I want to store the path to the element as the text might change
22:42  Phrogz_: naturalethic: Via a large variety of possible heuristics?
22:42  naturalethic: presuming the document structure doesn't change, but the text might, i want to retain the path
22:42  RomD: naturalethic: like var $foo = $('#foo .bar')?
22:42  Phrogz_: I'd go for element ID up the ancestry chain first, and then class, and then element.
22:43  pifantastic: naturalethic: you already have the element, just save that
22:43  Phrogz_: naturalethic: If it really, really, really, really, REALLY is never going to change, just use the hierarchy plus a sibling index.
22:43  naturalethic: Right, is there a function to find the hierarchy so I don't have to write it myself
22:43  Phrogz_: (it being the document structure). But that still seems like a shortsighted decision.
22:44  seancurtis: or if it's that important give it a semantic ID and target it directly?
22:44  naturalethic: i cannot modify the document
22:44  pifantastic: naturalethic: you have the element, dont save the path, save the actual element object
22:44  Phrogz_: naturalethic:     var path = []; var me = el; while (me){  path.push(me); me = me.parentNode;  }
22:45  Phrogz_: pifantastic: That wouldn't work across different page loads and sessions.
22:45  naturalethic: pifantastic: i can't assume the element is special enough to uniquely identify it based on its attributes alone
22:45  pifantastic: You need a reference to the element across page loads?
22:45  pifantastic: that's something you need to do on the server side
22:45  naturalethic: Phrogz_: i'd need sibling (array order) info as well, but yeah basically that -- i just want something already written :)
22:46  naturalethic: pifantastic: this is for screenscraping, its not my document
22:46  pifantastic: oic
22:46  MagusOTB: Is there a clever way to slice out the center of a string and replace it with "..." or something of the sort?
22:46  seancurtis: yahoo pipes?
22:46  naturalethic: i guess i just figured jQuery would have a
22:47  naturalethic: .. generateSelector or some such -- seems useful
22:47  MagusOTB: I want to display strings in a space that has a certain length, and if they are too long, I'd like to cut out the middle. Is there a function to do that somwhere or shoudl I just write one?
22:47  naturalethic: MagusOTB there are non-standard CSS attributes that do that, not sure how up-to-date they are in modern browsers
22:47  pifantastic: MagusOTB: by certain length, do you mean, certain # of words, certain # of characters, or certain # of pixels?
22:48  seancurtis: use a combo of substring and replace MagusOTB
22:48  seancurtis: naturalethic: you thinking of text-overflow: ellipsis?
22:48  seancurtis: only adds ... to the end
22:48  MagusOTB: pifantastic: characters or pixels would be fine. It's not going to have any whitespace in it, so words wouldn't mean much
22:48  naturalethic: oh right, guess that's standard
22:48  khmer: MagusOTB: yeah i'd just write one
22:48  seancurtis: naturalethic: nah not all browsers support it
22:52  seancurtis: MagusOTB: do you need the ellipsis in the middle?
22:52  MagusOTB: seancurtis: yeah.
22:52  seancurtis: saw a few jquery plugins that do trailing ones
22:52  temp01: it's standardized and all browsers except ff have supported it for a long time
22:52  naturalethic: for anyone who was interested, here we go: http://www.jessieamorris.com/random/selectorDetector.js
22:52  MagusOTB: seancurtis: it's for showing a DNA sequence, and the only part that really ever needs to be hand checked are the first and last 20 bases or so.
22:53  seancurtis: MagusOTB: do it on the server?
22:55  MagusOTB: seancurtis: the place that it's shown is resizable, and if I'm going to write a function to do it, writing it in PHP versus in JS isn't much more or less work.
22:58  khmer: String.prototype.preview = function() {var len = (!arguments||!arguments[0]||parseInt(arguments[0]===NaN) ? 127 : arguments[0]; return [this.substring(0,Math.floor(this.length/2)).substring(0,Math.floor(len/2)),this.substring(Math.floor(this.length/2),this.length-1).substring(Math.floor(this.length/2)-Math.floor(len/2),Math.floor(this.length/w))].join(' [...] ';}
22:58  khmer: that ought to do it
22:59  Hoe``: How do I also include all the children in a selection?
22:59  Hoe``: so I have $(foo) but I also want it's children
22:59  seancurtis: $('#foo').children().andSelf()
23:00  Hoe``: thanks :)
23:00  khmer: MagusOTB: i air coded that and it definitely won't work on the first try, but there you are
23:00  khmer: MagusOTB: for instance it's missing an end paren there :)
23:01  MagusOTB: khmer: thanks :D will try it.
23:01  kenman: anyone know why height() and css('height') would return drastically different values?
23:02  kenman: e.g. one returns 1087 and the other returns "1453px"....for the same element
23:02  Hoe``: hehe, because you've got a hight attribute does not mean it's the height
23:02  khmer: wow hmm MagusOTB it could be way simpler :)
23:03  kenman: p.s. I'm trying to fix an overflow/scrollbars bug in IE... there's lots of nested elements, my table on the inside is stretching beyond the bottom of the screenm, and so are it's scrollbars
23:03  Hoe``: kenman: which one is correct? I'd assume height()
23:04  kenman: depends on what you mean by "correct"
23:04  kenman: it needs to be the value of height(), but its really the value of css('height')
23:06  kenman: height() just seems to be reporting the viewable height
23:06  kenman: whereas css('height') is the true height of the element
23:07 --- anos is now known as eternicode
23:07  Hoe``: use it then :) just pass it through parseInt to strip the px and get an int
23:08  kenman: i was hoping to find out why the reported heights are diff or why my table isn't respecting the suppsoedly bounding box
23:09  Hoe``: "Note that .height() will always return the content height, regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property."
23:09  Hoe``: there is that note, but I really don't know
23:10  kenman: box-sizing is CSS3 I believe which doesnt even apply to IE8
23:10  kenman: i know its a problem with my html/css, unfortunately its not easily demonstratable here
23:13  khmer: MagusOTB: String.prototype.preview = function(len) {len = len || 40; return [this.substring(0,Math.floor(len/2)),this.substring(this.length-Math.floor(len/2),this.length)].join(" [...] ");}
23:16  MagusOTB: Is there an advantage to doing it with join vs doing it like this: return str.substr(0, len/2-1)+".."+str.substr(str.length-len/2-1);
23:19  MagusOTB: (substitude this for str, cause I didn't use prototype)
23:26  markedwords: I'm trying to time a function to fire after all other javascript has completed.  Is there a way to do that?
23:26  jrockjiggz: you need to use callbacks
23:26  jrockjiggz: or event firing
23:27  markedwords: Some of the javascript in question has no callbacks, that's the problem
23:27  markedwords: What event could I use?
23:27  coldhead: markedwords: its kind of like schroedingers cat
23:28  coldhead: you're saying i want to give my friend a book, and put him in a box, and i want to do something when he finishes reading it
23:28  coldhead: but how can you know?
23:28  coldhead: and what if he finished but he's reading chapter 3 again because it was funny
23:28  jrockjiggz: markedwords: $(document).bind('runJS', function() { SOME CODE });   then: $(document).trigger('runJS');
23:29  jrockjiggz: yea thats true
23:29  markedwords: Right, I get it.  The problem I have is certain parts of the javascript affect the height of the document, and I need to make a height measurement when its settled down.
23:30  coldhead: markedwords: the simple fix for that is to set a timeout, and fix that shit 2 secrodns after page load
23:30  coldhead: or some reasonable amount
23:30  markedwords: coldhead: head, I'm trying to avoid such a hack
23:31  coldhead: put the fixy code as the very last bit of JS you load then?
23:31  markedwords: jrockjiggz, so then I could do something like, $(document).ready().trigger('runJS'); ?
23:31  markedwords: coldhead: yeah, not working unfortunately
23:32  markedwords: the offending library is FLIR font replacement I think, and its just doing its own thing.
23:33  coldhead: markedwords: if you can maybe load the font replacement with getScript
23:33  coldhead: that gives you a callback
23:33  coldhead: and you could do cleanup in there
23:34  disappearedng: quick question about organization of html nodes: if I were to use a table with 5 tds, how can I determine which td has the number of elements?
23:35  jrockjiggz: markedwords: are you using ajax?
23:35  seancurtis: disappearedng: umm can you rephrase that question - it doesn't make sense
23:35  coldhead: disappearedng: specifically the "has the number of elements" bit
23:36  disappearedng: ok I think it would make more sense if you look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/tags so I need to dynamically append a tag to the table.
23:36  markedwords: jrockjiggz: I don't think so

23:39  coldhead: ?getscript @ markedwords
23:39  bot-t: markedwords, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
23:39  markedwords: thanks guys, gonna try that in a second
23:39  coldhead: disappearedng: go on?
23:40  seancurtis: disappearedng: do you want to add to the shortest col?
23:41  Yan_Nick: Can you explain me please when do I need function(context)
23:41  disappearedng: yeah
23:41  disappearedng: basiccally I want to insert to the shortest column
23:42  seancurtis: disappearedng: var shortestCol, max = 999; $(".tag-col').each(function(){ if ($(this).find('.post-tag').length < max) { shortestCol = this} }); $(shortestCol).append(foo);
23:42  disappearedng: I was thinking of doing .length on a $('.column > .tags)
23:42  disappearedng: ok so yeah the same method
23:42  disappearedng: anyway thx
23:50  sha1sum: hey all. what's an easy way for me to $(element).prepend() n times?
23:51  Yan_Nick: Guys? How can I repeat the last 2 steps after 3 clicks using toggle?
23:51  kenman: sha1sum, i think it will prepend() for every element in your $() set
23:51  Yan_Nick: 1. Load  / 2. Pause / 3. Play / 4. Pause / 5. Play.
