02:03  mortana: it's the htmlentities that might mess stuff up
02:03  mekwall: possibly
02:04  mortana: other than that, it kinda works sweet
02:04  mortana: I'm using jQuery
02:04  mortana: and PHP

02:05  matze145d: Hey guys, how can I do sth. with all "a"s which haven't the "title" attribute?
02:06  mekwall: $('a:not([title])')
02:08  matze145d: thx
02:08  matze145d: mekwall: $('a:not([title])').attr("title", $(this).attr("href"));
02:09  mekwall: what is `this`?
02:09  matze145d: mekwall: the selector
02:09  mekwall: matze145d: a:not([title]) ? :)
02:09  mekwall: if so, that won't work
02:10  matze145d: mekwall: all links with a href and without a title should get the href as title
02:10  mekwall: matze145d: $('a:not([title])').map(function(){ this.title = this.href; });
02:10  mekwall: might not work though
02:10  matze145d: mekwall: why map instead of each?
02:11  mekwall: map is faster
02:11  matze145d: mekwall: i should ever use map instead of each?
02:11  mekwall: no
02:11  mekwall: different functionality
02:11  matze145d: and how can i select the a's which hasn't a title (done) and have a href?
02:11  matze145d: ?map
02:11  bot-t: .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
02:12  mekwall: wait....
02:12 * mekwall is being stupid :p
02:12  mekwall: getting late here
02:12  matze145d: $('a:not([title][href])').map(function(){ this.title = this.href; }); ?
02:12  matze145d: here in germany it's 2:12am
02:13  mekwall: same here
02:13  matze145d: mekwall: where u are?
02:13  mekwall: $('a:not([title][href])').each(function(){ var $this = $(this); $this.attr('title', this.href); });
02:13  mekwall: try that
02:14  mekwall: not sure this.title will work

14:49  piklu: atula: Agreed
14:50  atula: ss23: I suppose... but here's why I am a bit jumpy. I got private message with random question.. I jump into #jquery and see a little argument... not about jquery
14:50  atula: soooo I just want to make sure things are good.
14:50  atula: I want to protect the users in #jquery from spam as much as I can
14:51  piklu: atula: I really do not care, if others are not happy. I already said that guy alainxx that ok, I ll not, but he was nuts to make me declare it openly, and so trying to pull legs, common @ irc, where u got friends and a stranger comes in

15:33  nYmo_: hi, what have i to do when i use load(), to load new data into an div but then i want to use some document.ready functions on the new imported data?
15:34 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 105 seconds
15:35  atula: nYmo_: there's a complete callback. i.e... once the div is finish loading the callback executes
15:35  atula: may that's something you're looking for
15:35  atula: ?load
15:35  bot-t: .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
15:35  Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/eax8W/ seems like when I'm asking if a certain td is empty .. the other td is not made empty.. any quick solution for this?
15:35  temp01: ?load(url)
15:35  bot-t: .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
15:36  atula: http://api.jquery.com/load/
15:36  atula: :/
15:36  Ely2: ow
15:36  Ely2: should be :empty
15:36  Ely2: my bad
15:36  Carneque: http://www.jsfiddle.net/tPyCu/1/
15:36  atula: saw the wrong url so I went to look for it :P
15:36  nYmo_: atula:yeah but the imported data is a link and it should only be executed when you click on it and that is the problem
15:37  atula: nYmo_: then bind it in the callback function
15:37  atula: nYmo_: you could also use .live
15:37  atula: ?live
15:37  bot-t: .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
15:38  nYmo_: ah okay so i have to write a document ready function in the callback of the load
15:38  Carneque: I'm triggering the source with a function which adds the source, the path, and appends the element to the body
15:39  Carneque: I think that's how you'd describe what I'm doing
15:39  Carneque: :/
15:39  atula: no need for document ready in there... just write the bind function in there. by that time... when the callack is called the document is alreayd done nYmo_ again.. read .live event and see if maybe that's something you want
15:40  nYmo_: atula:thanks i read the api for live this would work !!
15:40  Vorspire: sean`; turns out pushStack wasn't what I needed, got everything working now using obj = obj.add(extObj);

15:41  sean`: pushStack just creates an array of objects
15:41  sean`: add extends

15:42  sean`: wwhat are you making
15:42  JuJuBee: I have an ajax routine that returns a form and I want to attach a .click to the submit on that form.  Do I add  the js to the return html or is there a way to attach from main calling page?  Since the  form does not exist until after ajax call  putting in .ready does not make sense.
15:43  Vorspire: sean`; don't worry, i'm only hooking the scope for testing doc.ready
15:44  sean`: kl
15:47  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: you can make it a live/delegate event, or just attach the event after you insert the form
15:48  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: how do I attach after inserting the form?
15:49  JuJuBee: in the success portion of the ajax?
15:49  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: just after you do .html() or whatever to insert it, do $(blah).submit(... or whatever
15:49  JuJuBee: OK, thanks
15:49  RTPMatt: sure thing
15:50  JuJuBee: So if the new submit is another ajax call, it will look pretty ugly, huh
15:51  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: you can make it a seperate function and just do $(blah).submit(myOtherFunction)
15:51  RTPMatt: where you have var myOtherFunction = function(e) {...} defined somewhere else
15:51  RTPMatt: that cleans it up a bit
15:51  JuJuBee: Would I put the myOtherFunction definition outside the .ready

17:27  gigamonkey: i'm trying to use hover() on one element to display and hide another element. However the mouseleave event seems to fire instantly.
17:27  gigamonkey: When I change the handler functions to do something else (like change the color of the whole body) they fire when I expect: i.e. when the mouse goes ever the element the color changes and when I move it out, the color changes back.
17:27  gigamonkey: What am I missing?
17:29  gigamonkey: Hmmm. I can also display and hide the second element with no problem as long as I don't reposition it.

17:47  webben: Tallisman: So the second call errors

18:40  rmurphey: Zenger: well, the one line you pasted should work
18:40  rmurphey: and since it's not, it'd be helpful for you to put together a small demo that shows it not working
18:41  Univ: Zenger: where are you placing this line of javascript ? In head ?
18:41  Zenger: Now i am realising that  $("img").mouseover(function() {       alert('Zenger');   }); this is not working either ... :D . but the ajax call worked like a charm
18:41  Zenger: yes in head
18:41  Univ: okay
18:41  Univ: it's normal
18:42  rmurphey: is it inside a document ready block?
18:42  Univ: Zenger: try $(document).ready(function() { $('.thumbs').mouseover(grabtitle); });
18:43  piklu: atula: u there?
18:43  atula: piklu: ?
18:43  Univ: if you're not using a document ready block, you are just placing a callback on an element that doesn't exist yet
18:45  elegos: hello! How can I debug a $.getJSON call? It seems it simply doesn't work... I tried to console.log the first line of the called function, but there is nothing in the console!
18:45  Univ: firebug ?
18:45  elegos: site: http://test.elegosproject.org/tutorial/elegos/Test_guide.html - JS: http://test.elegosproject.org/tutorial/elegos/script.php?user=elegos&guide=Test_guide
18:46  elegos: there seems to be no error in the JS console
18:46  elegos: that's the point
18:46  Univ: Zenger: did you fix your problem ?
18:47  Zenger: I've moved my code to a blank page and realized that you were right, now I am fixing my code , I think i'm gonna be ok
18:48  Univ: great :)
18:49  Univ: elegos: your getJSON call succeeds
18:49  elegos: I think it's just the JSON file messed up
18:50  Univ: I would check the callback function if I were you
18:50  elegos: btw is there a way in general in jQuery to catch errors?
18:50  Univ: the JS errors should appear on your error console
18:50  elegos: for example, if the JSON file is corrupted, what does jQuery do?
18:50  elegos: but they don't
18:50  elegos: in fact there was an issue in the JSON file
18:50  Univ: so the error must be in the logic
18:51  Univ: the returned JSON looks pretty clean to me
18:52  piklu: [ Anybody interesting in participating in a project for Web UI's against a profit share can contact me ]
18:52  rmurphey: elegos: you may want to try using $.ajax instead of $.getJSON
18:52  rmurphey: ?ajax
18:52  bot-t: jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
18:53  elegos: rmurphey: yes I may, but what's the point if there is a getJSON method?
18:53  rmurphey: imho the "convenience" functions don't end up being very convenient :)
18:53  elegos: Univ: I've fixed it, this is why it's correct now :)
18:53  rmurphey: elegos: for starters, the ability to specify a failure callback?
18:53  ben_alman: so, re. inheritance.. i see http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/03/base/ and http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/ - does anyone have a recommended approach for doing inheritance, like one of these two or another?
18:53  ben_alman: rmurphey surely you have an opinion about inheritance
18:53  ben_alman: or SlexAxton
18:54 * ben_alman is a n00b
18:54  rmurphey: prototypal is often just fine
18:54  ben_alman: well these all do that under the hood, they just offer sugar
18:54  rmurphey: it depends on what you're doing, but i've done stuff that just uses Object.create and that's all i need
18:54  Zenger: This is crazy :) . Is there any possibility the code not to work on a ajax loaded content ? I make an ajax call that loads 20 images all have the class thumbs, lower , I write <a href='#' calss='thumbs'>Test</a> , when I hover over Test the code works, but when I hover on the ajax loaded content nothin happens ...
18:55  rmurphey: Zenger: it is not only possible, it is how it works
18:55  ben_alman: rmurphey Object.create is ECMA 5
18:55  rmurphey: you need to use event delegation if you want to automatically bind to stuff as it's added to the page
18:55  rmurphey: ben_alman: yes but trivial to fake
18:55  ben_alman: exactly
18:55  ben_alman: sthat's what i'm looking for :D
18:56  Zenger: rmurphey: Didn't get it ...
18:56  rmurphey: ben_alman: you're looking for how to fake Object.create? http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html
18:56  ben_alman: oh, it's that
18:56  ben_alman: ok, gotcha
18:56  ben_alman: i've seen that before.
18:56  rmurphey: Zenger: when you do $('.foo') you are only selecting elements *currently on the page*
18:56  ben_alman: thanks rmurphey, you rock.
18:56  rmurphey: not elements that appear on the page later
18:57  rmurphey: if you are adding to the page later, you have two options
18:57  rmurphey: one, re-bind
18:57  Zenger: rmurphey: ?
18:57  rmurphey: two, event delegation
18:57  rmurphey: ?delegate
18:57  bot-t: .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
18:57  rmurphey: ben_alman: yw :)
18:57  rmurphey: i've used that and i've used john's
18:58  Zenger: hm... how can i delegate ?
18:58  rmurphey: ?delegate
18:58  bot-t: .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
18:58  Zenger: rmurphey: :) the rebind worked :)
18:58  rmurphey: Zenger: rebind is entirely the wrong way to do it
18:59  rmurphey: altho yes it will work
18:59  Zenger: I know, but the problem is that I am newb to jQuery ))
18:59  rmurphey: you must make sure that you're only binding to new elements, and it can get very inefficient in a hurry
18:59  rmurphey: Zenger: that's why i'm suggesting you read up on delegate() and event delegation in general
18:59  rmurphey: Zenger: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html#N20EB8
19:00  Univ: Zenger: did you try live ?
19:01  Zenger: Univ: Slow down :) I am fammiliar only with the basics :D I am reading about delegate now ) . But please tell me about live
19:01  Univ: $('.thumbs').live('click', grabtitle);
19:01  Univ: instead of your $('.thumbs').click(grabtitle);
19:01  Univ: http://api.jquery.com/live/
19:01  rmurphey: Univ: delegate is now the preferred method
19:02 --- arpegius_ is now known as arpegius
19:02  rmurphey: chances are that Zenger could identify the container in which .thumbs elements will appear
19:02  Univ: yep, I know that
19:02  rmurphey: $('#thumbsContainer').delegate('.thumbs', 'click', grabTitle)
19:03  Univ: live was probably the easiest way to make it work
19:03  Univ: that's why =)
19:03  Zenger: xD I would like to know it properly workin , not just workin' )
19:03  Univ: both will work
19:04  Univ: and work properly
19:05  Zenger: the manual says that it would be better to use delegate instead live
19:05  Univ: $(foo).live(...) is basically a shortcut for $('body').delegate(foo, ...)
19:05  rmurphey: especially if you can easily identify a containing element
19:05  rmurphey: because, yes, otherwise the containing element is assumed to be the body
19:06  Univ: well, use delegate then :)
19:06  rmurphey: so any click, anywhere on the body, is tested
19:06  rmurphey: to see whether it matches the criteria
19:06  rmurphey: .live() also comes with the cost of the initial and unnecessary selection of $('.thumbs')
19:06  rmurphey: which, in browsers without QSA, is not inexpensive
19:07  Univ: rmurphey: didn't thought about it, thanks for the hint!
19:07  rmurphey: .live() was an api error, imho
19:07  rmurphey: it should not be used
19:11  Drule: Ok so my domain got hijacked by the registrar register.com and is now up for bids. They did this when I tried to move the domain *away* from them to another registar. Anyone got any experience with this that could potentially help me?
19:13  Univ: complaint to the register ?
19:13  Univ: what is the tld ?
19:14  RTPMatt: if you are in the right, threaten legal action, they might just give up then
19:14  l4rk: lol good luck
19:14  l4rk: you're pretty much sol
19:15  piklu: Drule: can u sue them
19:15  piklu: ?
19:15  l4rk: piklu: seriously dude?
19:15  piklu: Drule: did it got expired or somebody got it transferred
19:15  l4rk: also its not a tld
19:15  Drule: no piklu, they just hijacked it
19:15  Drule: and denied me the move
19:16  l4rk: ...
19:16  kurol: lifehacker just had a post on this
19:16  Univ: Drule: what TLD ?
19:16  piklu: Drule: what domain ?
19:16  Univ: is it a gtld or a cctld ?
19:16  l4rk: Univ: dude its not a TLD
19:16  Univ: l4rk: the domain must have an extension...
19:16  piklu: Drule: send them a legal notice first by your lawyer friend
19:16  Drule: piklu gamingw.net
19:16  l4rk: oh i see you're just asking
19:16  Drule: Univ I don't know.
19:16  Drule: Ya I guess.
19:16  RTPMatt: are you sure they didn't just park it till it gets finally moved and you can change your DNS?
19:16  l4rk: you don't know if its a .com or a co.uk?
19:16  Univ: Drule: so it's .net ;)
19:17  Drule: Ya.
19:17  piklu: Drule: did u take help from the registrar you are moving to
19:17  piklu: such cases are taken very seriously
19:17  Drule: No.
19:17  Drule: But that's a good diea.
19:17  piklu: whois it, and check what name it reflects
19:18  piklu: the best idea is getting a legal action done against registrar.com, sending a mail to their support team first
19:18  piklu: if the whois details are changed, this is kill
19:19  rmurphey: the whois record shows it expiring on 12/17/2010
19:19  Univ: Drule : you also should try to contact Verisign
19:19  piklu: also, if you own blog and some famous website, or a friend owns one, get this incident published
19:19  Drule: Alright.
19:19  piklu: and digg it
19:19  Drule: Yeah.
19:19  rmurphey: can you explain a bit more about exactly what happened?
19:19  Drule: Oh dude, that's a great idea.
19:19  Univ: in such cases, Register.com could loose his licence
19:20  piklu: get a screenshot, and mail their support team
19:20  piklu: saying we are gonna get u for this
19:20  Drule: There's nothing to explain. We had a domain, we asked to get it moved, they denied due to "suspicious activities" and then they closed it and put it up for bids.
19:20  piklu: Drule: you should gather all proof that u actually owned it
19:21  Univ: yea, ask Verisign what to do
19:21  piklu: Check Archive.com, if they have your website on this domain
19:21  Univ: there is a chat support here : https://knowledge.verisign-grs.com/support/registrar/index?page=nosidebarlogin&returnqs=page%3Dhome%26cat%3DV_R_COMNET%26vproductcat%3DV_R_COMNET
19:21  piklu: Get a copy from google's cache, which may show your IP pointed to this domain too
19:22  Drule: They do piklu
19:22  Drule: Alright Univ.
19:22  Drule: Thanks for all the good ideas.
19:22  piklu: Gather all sort of proof you can today
19:22  piklu: and blogging is best
19:22  Univ: (this is *supposed* to be intended for registrars only, but...)
19:22  Univ: you could also call them directly
19:22  piklu: Univ: they might know what to do
19:23  Univ: piklu: Who ? Verisign ?
19:23  Univ: That's their job
19:23  Univ: (well, it should be)
19:23  piklu: Drule: there is a rule, a domain can not be put up back for new registarant untill its expired and 1 month locking period after it is over, in which the original owner has exclusive rights to get it renewed
19:24  piklu: since ur domain got expired on 17 December
19:24  piklu: u have rights upto 17th Jan
19:24  Drule: oh
19:24  piklu: to renew it anyhow
19:24  Drule: thats really cool
19:24  Drule: maybe thats a good timeframe to try to get it back
19:24  piklu: they simply can not allow registering it by any other person
19:25  rmurphey: did it actually expire or not?
19:25  Drule: I can't say, my partner has the actual ownership.
19:25  Drule: But I don't think it expired.
19:25  piklu: You need to check with the guy
19:25  Univ: and even if it does, that changes nothing
19:25  rmurphey: i'm just gonna suggest that you figure that out first :)
19:25  rmurphey: before you start threatening to sue people
19:25  piklu: because sometimes internal control panel have options to make it available for bidding
19:25  Univ: really, start with Verisign
19:26  Univ: pikklu : but it should not change the ownership
19:26  rmurphey: why not start with "oh shit did we let this domain expire by mistake?"
19:26  piklu: You must talk with the owner first, and proceed along
19:26  Univ: which was done, according to the whois
19:26  piklu: It would park the page and make it go for bidding

19:42  Bennit: writing this in my chrome console returns an XMLHttpRequest object: $.post('Register',{username:'jos',firstname:'jos',lastname:'frans',password1:'jos',password2:'jos',email:'jos@jos.com'},function(data) {console.log(data);},"json")
19:42  Bennit: nothing ever gets logged
19:43  Bennit: if I fold open the return object from the post, the response & response text are these: "{password1:false,username:'Username not available',password2:false,email:false,lastname:false,firstn…"
19:43  Bennit: so I'd say the "on success" function should be executed, no?
19:43  rmurphey: Bennit: is the response valid json served as json?
19:44  Bennit: I don't get any errors that it's not
19:44  rmurphey: (also you may want to use the more feature-ful $.ajax instead of $.post)
19:44  tehKitteh: i'm using the validate plugin for my contact form. how do i change the border color of input fields if its input is invalid?
19:44  Bennit: yeah i was using that one before but since It didn't get solved, I tried with $.post, perhaps I misset some vars
19:45  rmurphey: Bennit: $.post is just a convenience wrapper for $.ajax
19:45  rmurphey: but, if you're not sending back valid json then it's not going to help :)
19:45  rmurphey: http://www.jsonlint.com/
19:46  Bennit: {error:'Username not available'} # says it expects tstring or }, why?
19:46  Bennit: aha
19:47  rmurphey: Bennit: what are you using to generate your json server-side?
19:47  Bennit: {"error": "Username not available"} # that one does it
19:47  Bennit: well I was using a java json object, but since it gave some errors I tought something was wrong with the json encoding
19:47  rmurphey: do not generate your json by hand on the server
19:47  Bennit: guess i'll go back to the jsonobject :)

20:10  into`: any idea?
20:11  into`: <module> is the parent element of the xml file
20:13  atula: into`: have you try $(xml).find('module') ?
20:13  into`: yes, returns 0 too
20:13  atula: haven't done xml in a long time heh
20:14  atula: hmm... xml is legit? as in is it valid xml ?
20:14  atula: IE is a pain when it comes to xml/html in response.. it breaks if stuff is invalid

20:16  Univ: Hey, I have a string like "function() { alert('foo') }" returned by a REST web service
20:17  Univ: how do I eval it?
20:17  Univ: firefox returns a syntax error
20:18  RTPMatt: well, eval((function() { alert('foo'); })());
20:18  RTPMatt: but i would first see if you can find a solution that does not use eval
20:18  snover: sending arbitrary code to be evaluated by the client in that way is like…a pretty terrible idea
20:19  rmurphey: +1
20:20  Univ: yes, but it's not *my* web service
20:20  rmurphey: allt he more reason not to eval its code
20:20  Univ: I have no control on it, I just have to use it
20:20  Univ: the client asks me to do that, I just do that
20:20  Univ: :/
20:20  rmurphey: what does it actually send back
20:21  Univ: a callback to a function that I have to define
20:21  rmurphey: so it's jsonp?
20:21  Univ: nope
20:21  Univ: no json
20:22  RTPMatt: is the function the same every time?
20:22  Univ: a specific callback with three parameters
20:22  Univ: RTPMatt: For the moment, more or less. But it's not guaranteed to stay that way
20:23  rmurphey: how does the provider of the web service reocmmend that you use it?
20:23  Univ: he does not recommand anything except "Eval the code returned"
20:24  snover: this sounds well-engineered already
20:24  Univ: this is not
20:24  RTPMatt: I don't know, seems like a bad idea to trust someone who tells you "Just trust me and do this terrible thing"
20:24  rmurphey: by evaling the code, you are givng the third party the ability to execute js from your domain
20:25  Univ: this will be my client's site, I already told him it was a bad idea, he just doesn't want to hear anything
20:26  Univ: so if he wants to take the risk, wery well

20:32  carpet_the_walls: hi, using the jquery "build your download" service. Would i be right in saying that after you have completed the download, there are several directories, the one labeld "js" contains everything you need for your project, based on your selections?
20:33  jones-: Hello. If inside a selector I have a .each loop, and inside the .each I use $(this), will it refer to the thing I'm looping or to the selected element?
20:33  Univ: jones-: to the current element in the loop

20:37  Univ: yes
20:37  rmurphey: jones-: $.each is a generic iterator function
20:37  rmurphey: $.fn.each is the each to call to iterate over a selection

20:38  jones-: Ok thanks guys. Besides, I was iterating thw wrong selection :)
20:38  rmurphey: they do similar but different things
20:38  Univ: you could do $.each($('img.flickr-thing'), function() { ... });

21:32  johnathanb: Is there anyway to disable the "Back" buttons in jQuery Mobile? The one that sits in the Header when I stray from the first page?
21:33  johnathanb: Also is there anyway to go to another page pragmatically? Like after a successful login or something?
21:33  Dirkos: I have a strange bug in google Chrome (only firefox works ok)
21:33  Dirkos: http://www.jsfiddle.net/DSQCV/
21:33  Dirkos: drag the square to the left corner and pull it down after that :o
21:33  Dirkos: or pull it down really fast
21:36  Dirkos: Only happens when the block is attached to the left side or something
21:38  Prometheus: Dirkos: funky
21:38  Dirkos: yeah funky but not funny at all haha
21:39  Dirkos: maybe at has something todo with the float but dunno for sure
21:45  ty2u: Hishi[Revo], how can i take an onclick attribute and move it to a jquery .click event so I can add another function before it?
21:46  ty2u: i mean hi
21:54  borior: hello all. if I make an ajax request with jQuery that returns with a "Location" header, jQuery does the right thing and goes and GETs it for me. The only problem is that I'm at a loss as to how I can set custom headers on this second request.
21:54  borior: any ideas?
21:57  Jarda: borior: it's not jquery doing the Locaiton-header following
21:57  Jarda: it's your browser
21:58  Jarda: and I've discovered, chrome sets the same request headers for the "second" request, where as firefox doesn't
21:58  borior: Jarda: indeed
21:58  borior: just been doing a little more digging
21:58  borior: and this looks nasty
21:58  Jarda: so with firefox, I don't even get the "requested with" header for the "second" request
21:58  borior: this is registered as a bug with FF, that doesn't look like it's going to be fixed for FF4
21:59  borior: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=553888
21:59  Jarda: the one I use in my backend to detect something is requested with ajax
21:59  Jarda: oh, yes. I've run just into that
21:59  Jarda: I just worked around it in my backend
21:59  borior: eugh.
22:00  into`: argh fuck IE: why does it return 0 and firefox, chrome and so on 1: alert($(xml).children('module').length);
22:00  into`: .find('module') returns in IE 0 too
22:00  borior: that's horrible. so now I have to get my API's create & update calls to return the object they just created rather than a redirect to the resource URL
22:00  into`: the xml file is valid
22:01  borior: Jarda: oh well. thanks for the heads-up
22:03  Jarda: borior: no problem. As my problem was trivial (wrong view method being called, as in I got the wrong template), I just worked it around with putting an url parameter to the redirect url
22:10  jrockjiggz:  using UI datepicker, having already instantiated the plugin, i later want to change a change, it doesn't seem to let me re-instantiate ontop of the element with the changed settings
22:12  RTPMatt: jrockjiggz: why dont you just set the setting on the old one, rather than make a new one?

22:38  tomaw: It was a global notice to all users.  You don't need to respond unless you feel the need :)
22:39  Hopsy: ah
22:39  Hopsy: okay :D
22:41  jrockjiggz: hmm. with datepicker(), if i select yearRange: '-10:+10', whenever you choose a year, and re-open the datepicker, the range is shifted +10/-10 from the select year
22:41  richardr: Hi, I'm using jQuery Accordion and I'd like to define a custom HTML. Instead of <h3> then a <div>, I want that, but wrapped within another <div> for easy targetting. How would I achieve this?
22:42  richardr: <div><h3></h3><div></div></div>

23:04  Tallisman: is there anyone here with knowledge of form spamming? might seem odd but i got a challenge of a classmate to spam his website.. but i can't seem to find anything on this matter =(
23:04  snover: Tallisman: uh-huh.
23:05  Tallisman: actually that above story is true :P
23:06  Tallisman: but as far as i got, i need to get an external website using iframe and then bind a local form to it.. no clue what to do next and i have looked for several hours on google >.<
23:07  semaphore: i wouldn't use jquery to do it
23:07  semaphore: you can't use an iframe
23:08  Tallisman: yea :P, i tryed to fill the form by binding jquery to the iframe, but that isn't possible from external sources
23:08  mekwall: Tallisman: I'd just use some kind of distributed denial of form attack
23:08  Tallisman: mekwall, it is a challenge to break his form, not to kill his website.
23:09  mekwall: How boring.
23:09  Tallisman: :p
23:09  mekwall: Tallisman: how is breaking his form not killing his webiste?
23:09  mekwall: website*
23:09  Tallisman: well, i break his form, submit some entry's to his database and shut it of, in theory, then i won lol
23:09  mekwall: and as you said, you were planning to using a local form, which means its not his form anymore :P
23:10  mekwall: I don't really get this challenge
23:10  snover: Let’s not help Tallisman learn ethically questionable things :)
23:11  Tallisman: yea i already thought you guys would respond this way :P
23:11  mekwall: client-based form "security" is really just a layer of usability
23:11  mekwall: if your friend knows what he's doing, he would have implemented server-side security to deal with incoming data
23:11  Tallisman: google also responded this way.. i did learn 93.000 ways to prevent it
23:12  Tallisman: best way to prevent it is a captcha on most cases.
23:12  mekwall: hardiharrharr
23:12  mekwall: best way to prevent hammering is to have a delay :)
23:12  mekwall: throttle the requests
23:13  mekwall: so after the first request was sent, you'd throttle that client for its next request for that function
23:13  Tallisman: yea, but that is alot harder to implement :P
23:13  mekwall: not at all
23:13  mekwall: with a decent framework it's just a matter of a few lines of code
23:13  mekwall: fatfree framework for php, it's just one line of code )
23:14  mekwall: F3::set('THROTTLE', 300); heh
23:14  Tallisman: wow, that is indeed small lol, however, a framework is like learning a new language lol
23:14  mekwall: not if it's a good framework
23:14  Tallisman: then i do not find zend to be a good framework
23:14  mekwall: then it will come naturally :)
23:14  mekwall: zend is a behemoth
23:15  Tallisman: :P
23:15  mekwall: i am a minimalist.. I prefer micro frameworks that do the basics
23:15  Tallisman: then i indeed prefer your way :P
23:15  mekwall: http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/
23:15  mekwall: check it out if you want
23:15  mekwall: it's just one file to include :)
23:16  Tallisman: sure will ^^, now i need to continue searching :)
23:16  mekwall: I still don't get what you are trying to do with this challenge
23:16  dans: is there an easy way to fetch a link with jquery and prevent the page reloading? such as in pagination etc..
23:16  dans: if so, can someone show me a simple example
23:17  mekwall: dans: you mean, load data dynamically when clicking on a page link?
23:17  dans: yeah
23:17  mekwall: sure it's easy
23:17  dans: so the page is loaded without refreshing
23:17  Tallisman: actually it is just proving that i can :P, also he want's to see i can break it and then improve, and then again :P
23:17  dans: a new header being sent
23:17  dans: etc etc
23:17  mekwall: http://d-scribe.de/webtools/jquery-pagination/demo/demo_options.htm
23:17  dans: mekwall, can you give me the simplest example?
23:17  dans: thanks
23:17  mekwall: perhaps?
23:18  Univ: does anyone know how to check whether window.onpopstate is supported ?
23:18  dans: ok mekwall, so for that i need the jquery pagination plugin
23:19  dans: is there an easy way using standard jquery
23:19  mekwall: Univ: if (typeof window.onpopstate == 'function') { ... } ? :)
23:20  mekwall: dans: using a pagination plugin would be the jquery way :)
23:20  dans: ok mekwall
23:20  Univ: mekwall: well, it's null in FF4, and undefined in Chrome 8
23:20  Univ: never a function
23:20  Univ: :/
23:20  mekwall: cool
23:21  Univ: abd both are supporting it
23:21  Univ: and*
23:21  semaphore: Tallisman: there's one way to inject arbitrary code into a form
23:21  semaphore: with a bookmarklett
23:23  mekwall: ?.support @ Univ
23:23  bot-t: Univ, jQuery.support: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
23:23  mekwall: what about that?
23:24  Univ: doesn't seem to include a test for onpopstate...
23:25  mekwall: Univ: what about checking window.history.pushState ?
23:25  Tallisman: i don't think i need to insert arbitrary code, i just need to send form data from another place the form is on :P, an autoclicker would do the trick already, but i want to keep controll :P
23:26  mekwall: if (window.history.pushState) { console.log('YES!'); } :P
23:27  Univ: mekwall: Thanks!
23:27  Univ: You saved my life (kind of) :D
23:27  mekwall: Univ: onpopstate is just an event, and you have to bind it
23:27  mekwall: Univ: that's why it shows null/undefined ;)
23:27  Univ: yep
23:27  Univ: just what I was doing
23:27  Univ: thanks
23:27  mekwall: np
23:28  Univ: I just wish jQuery supports this event
23:28  Univ: out of the box
23:28  mekwall: Univ: extend it? :)
23:28  mekwall: and then post a patch
23:28  mekwall: probably it's already on route
23:28  Univ: never done that
23:28  Univ: i'm kind of a n00b :D
23:30  mekwall: Univ: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/BpvDV/
23:30  rmurphey: paul_irish: is this in modernizr? ^
23:30  dans: mekwall, do you know how i can write the callback function for that pagination plugin?
23:31  dans: in my case i dont really want pagination, i want an entire new page loaded
23:31  paul_irish: yes it is.
23:31  paul_irish: if (Modernizr.history)
23:31  mekwall: Univ: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/BpvDV/ updated
23:31  mekwall: it's really just one line of code hehe
23:31  rmurphey: just found it thanks paul_irish :)
23:32  Univ: mekwall: indeed... Thanks again.
23:32  Tallisman: hmm, one step closer.. i filled another form and just linked to the link the reall form was on :P
23:32  mekwall: dans: no idea, never used it
23:34  dans: :(
23:35  dans: im not sure its what im looking for
23:35  dans: seems too complicated
23:36  dans: i think i want $.get()
23:37  Tallisman: ah, better question, how can i send a form to an iframe?
23:37  snover: ?lmgtfy form to iframe @ Tallisman
23:37  bot-t: Tallisman, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=form+to+iframe
23:37  webben: Tallisman: "target"
