00:16  bekabug: $ is not a function -- Line 29   $(document).ready(function() {
00:17  Cliyeh: i've moved the sripts around and still the same thing
00:17 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 133 seconds
00:17  eTiger13: Bartzy|work: depends, if its .show() then theres not much of a perf diff. if its .show(300) or .show(300, effect) then yes it would be better to check, as long as you are caching your selecteor
00:17  eTiger13: Cliyeh: try fixing all the validation on your whole page first. that might help
00:17  Cliyeh: body content disappears right when the rotate script hides the first body
00:18  Bartzy|work: eTiger13: I'm caching my selector, but the .show() is only show().. no animation. Just leave it at that ? No is(':visible') check ?
00:18  Cliyeh: are you seeing all the validation problem in firebug?
00:18  eTiger13: yeah, it doesnt need it. jqueryui .show however needs it but regular jq doesnt
00:18  eTiger13: Cliyeh: yeah and html validator plugin
00:19  eTiger13: like a link tag in your body as well
00:19  Cliyeh: ok will need to d/l that
00:21  Snerf: if I hav an event.currentTarget from a keyup event from document, how can I get the class id of that currentTarget?
00:22  Dracos: $(event.currentTarget).attr('class')
00:23  Snerf: thanks Dracos
00:24  Dracos: DOM elements can be passed as the arg to $
00:24  ajpiano: or you could just do event.currentTarget.className
00:24  Bartzy|work: eTiger13 ?
00:25  Dracos: or that
00:26  Bartzy|work: how can I make an element move down and up 3 times before returning to it's original place ? just 3 times animate() ?

00:35  Third3ye: Ey, Firebug is giving me the error "a is undefined" on line 24 -- a bug with jquery or a bug with my script, or.. just wrong methodology?
00:35  Bartzy|work: what is line 24.
00:36  Third3ye: It's in jquery.min.js, Bartzy|work
00:36  Third3ye: and the line is ""find")f.selector=this.selector+(this....(a){return this.pushStack(c.map(this, "
00:36  Bartzy|work: what did you do to cause this
00:36  Third3ye: o.o
00:36  Third3ye: that was dramatically put
00:36  Third3ye: I have no idea quite frankly, but seems to be my fault then :/

00:41  FunnyLookinHat: Is there a way to scroll the window to a certain position with jQuery ?
00:41  FunnyLookinHat: scrollTop doesn't seem to be right... or is it ?
00:43  Figaroo: can I do $('<div/>') even though I can't do this in HTML?
00:43  GJdan: http://dpaste.org/5Hcg/   the domElement.onclick part of this at the top is currently not working with jquery (this was apparently made for mootools) what needs changed?

00:45  FunnyLookinHat: DAElectric: Will that scroll the view to the appropriate place?  Looks different...
00:47  Bartzy|work: animating margin-top is a bad idea ?
00:47  DAElectric: FunnyLookinHat: I havenet taken an indepth look at that. but it is supposed to be able to position anything in relation to anything else. The newest blog post on the ui has some new info on it
00:47  FunnyLookinHat: Ah figureed it out.
00:47  FunnyLookinHat: Thanks DA
00:47  FunnyLookinHat: DAElectric:

00:48  FunnyLookinHat: DAElectric: Your IRC client doesn't auto complete?  :)
00:48  croby: i'm having a strange issue with a selector -- $("*[title]") is returning an <input> with its name attribute set to 'title' -- <input name="title" type="text"/> -- is there a different selector I should be using?
00:48  croby: i'd expect it to only return elements that have a title attribute, not title in the value of the attribute
00:51  DAElectric: FunnyLookinHat: just using the webchat.freenode interface
00:54  FunnyLookinHat: Ah ok.
00:54  jrockjiggz: http://www.pjirc.com/demo.php online irc interface ipad friendly
00:56  ajpiano: croby: there are certain properties that are "Expando properties"
00:57  ajpiano: and jquery runs into isues with those in a lot of places
00:57  ajpiano: cause like, if you have a form, you can access any input in form by name like
00:57  ajpiano: <input name="foo">  === someform.foo
00:57  croby: ajpiano: very interesting
00:57  croby: it is inside a form, so this makes sense
00:58  ajpiano: i'm not saying it isn't a bug, it probably is
00:58  ajpiano: there are a lot of tickets though against this type of stuff in the tracker though
00:58  croby: okay, so its a known issue
00:58  ajpiano: yep
00:58  croby: is the only option right now then to simply change my attribute value so it doesn't get selected?
01:00  ajpiano: probably the fastest way to do it, yes, wuold be that
01:01  croby: ajpiano: okay, thanks for your input!
01:01  jqStarter: Guys...i need your suggestion for this problem http://www.jsfiddle.net/eyvqV/1/
01:01  DAElectric: jrockjiggz: looks too java dependent
01:02  Figaroo: Is $('<div/>') slower than $('<div></div>') or $('<div>')?
01:03  ajpiano: they're all the same, don't sweat it bro
01:03  DAElectric: jqStarter: do a search for jwuery xmltojson  handy plugin that will handle it for you
01:04  DAElectric: Figaroo: that should be about the same but doing several chaining it might be faster to build up the string first

12:26  antti_s: LiohAu: what are you trying to do?
12:26  LiohAu: trying to understand why this code works, and how
12:26  antti_s: LiohAu: the second parameter is used "as is" if it's a string, if it's not a string, then it goes through $.param
12:27  LiohAu: ok, is there something in the doc where they say that?
12:28  LiohAu: or should i guess it by myself?
12:28  antti_s: LiohAu: the inner workings of $.ajax (and .load) can be found from the jquery source
12:29  antti_s: LiohAu: but umm... why are you passing a function in the data?
12:29  boobo: found the problem..... IE doesnt handle dialog show/hide animation very well..
12:29  SugaSlide: ?source ajax
12:29 @bot-t: Line#6280 - "jQuery.support.ajax = !!jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr();" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6280
12:29  LiohAu: that is the problem, i saw that in the code of another person, and i thought it wasn't correct, but it works
12:30  LiohAu: so now i don't know if it is correct to bypass the "data" parameter or if it works by luck
12:32  antti_s: LiohAu: it works by luck

12:57  sean`: no, it's timing is off
12:57  pen: you sure livequery works for that event too? in the doc they only show off click
12:57  pen: maybe nvm
12:57  sean`: pen, it'll enable you to trigger events for elements that are to be inserted
12:58  sean`: if you do .append () and it contains a p, you can directly change it
12:58  timing: hmm shit
12:58  timing: how do I clone an element?
12:58  sean`: It's not directly a DOMNodeInserted event, but you can use it in such a way

I have an  "Add New" section that uses ajax to add a new course.  The routine sends the course name etc.. back to server and the server puts together some html to insert into the existing table of courses.
13:41  JuJuBee: This works fine.  I also have similar routine to delete a course which removes the item from the table.  Problem is that when I  try to remove a course I just added, it does not work.  Seems the post vars do not contain the id of the newly added course even though it is on the page.

14:08  JuJuBee: markj: don't think that live will do the trick.  When I add a course then select it and delete, the click action fires and calls the ajax routine, but the ID from the newly added  input doesn't get sent to the php script via the post
14:09 @sean`: JuJuBee, got link?
14:09  JuJuBee: sean`: trying to put together a simple example, not done
14:09 @sean`: cool
14:09 @sean`: you rawk
14:09  bartmax: sean`: with your code: Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #
14:10  markj: ah the click fires, yeah get the demo together :]
14:10 @sean`: console.log (id);
14:10 @sean`: see what it says
14:10  bartmax: c.l : 21product_name
14:10  bartmax: sorry
14:11  bartmax: c.l : product_name
14:12  bartmax: which is ok
14:12  bartmax: btw i modified one of your line attr('id')  for attr('for')
14:15  aro: why is this returning zero for an ajax element, even though alert( text ); returns the string? 		var text	= $(this).parent().find('input.bind-active-text').val();
14:15  aro: $(text).length is what returns zero
14:17  [1]pallet: can someone help me with http://pastebin.com/jw9516Ft please
14:17  doonie: how
14:18  [1]pallet: what I need it to be doing is actually changing #button, but instead it's just changing the SPAN like so <span onclick="popUp()" id="button" style="right: 0px;"></span>
14:18  [1]pallet: and I don't want the Style.. to be adding there, I need the CSS in #button to change
14:19  [1]pallet: does that make any sense ?
14:19  doonie: the span IS the id=button so...
14:19  doonie: eaither yer drunk, or donno what yer doin ;D
14:21  [1]pallet: doonie, thanks ;)
14:21  linelevel: [1]pallet: Nope, doesn't make any sense to me... '#button' is the selector for that SPAN tag
14:21  SugaSlide: LOL
14:21  doonie: here is another drunk ;>
14:21  SugaSlide: 15:19] <doonie> eaither yer drunk, or donno what yer doin ;D and he says thanks????
14:21  [1]pallet: ok, what I mean is if I look at it in Firebug,
14:21  SugaSlide: pfft
14:21  SugaSlide: ..|..
14:22  aro: anyone know why .length is returning 0?
14:22  bartmax: aro: try size()
14:22  [1]pallet: rather than changing the style it's creating style= in that span
14:22  aro: ok
14:22  doonie: how will it else apply a style on it
14:23  [1]pallet: ok, in firebug I can see that #button has right:0px for example
14:23  aro: size returns 0 too
14:23  aro: but if i just alert( text ); it alerts a long string
14:23  bartmax: aro: is your collection with no items? :D
14:24  doonie: [1]pallet yes that is from the style tag ;>
14:24  [1]pallet: but when my function fires it still says right:0px; and just adds a <span onclick="popUp()" id="button" style="left: 0px;"></span>
14:24  linelevel: bartmax: is there actually any different between .size() and .length ? the docs just say "use .length, it's faster"
14:24  aro: bartmax: it definitely has a value in there
14:24  bartmax: linelevel: don't know.
14:24  [1]pallet: I'm trying to override the style
14:25  aro: ajpiano: are you around? i need your genius
14:25  linelevel: aro: if .length returns 0, then it doesn't represent any dom elements. check your selector.
14:25  bartmax: aro: value ? try val(); size() or length() are for amount of objects in collection
14:25  aro: isnt it just .length
14:25  linelevel: yes
14:25  aro: its a property no?
14:26  SugaSlide: .size is basicaly .length in a wrapper
14:26  aro: like i said; alert( text ); returns a string
14:26  aro: alert( $(text).length ); returns 0
14:26  linelevel: aro: perhaps it is not a well-formed html strip representing a single element
14:27  bartmax: aro: alert(text.length) ?
14:27 --- a1986 is now known as blaa
14:28  linelevel: s/strip/string/
14:28  aro: its just a line of text
14:28  bartmax: is there any other way to get an element instead of using $('#" + id) ?
14:29  doonie: depends what you have
14:29  [1]pallet: So jQuery("#button").css("right", "0px"); doesn't actually dynamically change the CSS, it just adds a new tag in the SPAN ?
14:29  markj: bartmax that question is very vague, there are loads of ways to select elements, do you mean using the id variable you have?
14:29  doonie: [1]pallet bingo
14:29  doonie: dunamically
14:29  doonie: ups
14:29  doonie: it adds the style dynamically
14:30  linelevel: aro: the $() constructor takes either a selector or html as argument. In the former case it selects existing dom elements, in the latter it builds a new one (without inserting it into the dom)
14:30  Arimil: Wouldn't the false on this page prevent the link from triggering? http://jsfiddle.net/sfhmQ/
14:30  bartmax: markj: let me check something and I will rephrase it
14:31  linelevel: [1]pallet: It applies the style dynamically.
14:32  linelevel: aro: I'm not sure what you're expecting but $(text) will not give you anything useful for arbitrary text strings.
14:32  bartmax: var id = '#' + $this.attr('for');  --> this works, but throws a uncaught syntax error, unrecognized expression: #
14:32  JuJuBee: sean`: https://www.q3ait.org/ajax/TESTING/
14:32  linelevel: bartmax: $(this), not $this
14:32  bartmax: linelevel: i have $this = $(this) :)
14:32  linelevel: ah :)
14:34  linelevel: bartmax: the error is thrown on that line or when you invoke id as a selector?
14:35  [1]pallet: linelevel, the odd bit, I understand it adds the style dynamically, but it's adding the style, not over riding it
14:35  [1]pallet: linelevel, can I PM please ?
14:35  doonie: ?p @ [1]pallet
14:35 @bot-t: [1]pallet, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
14:36  Arimil: nvm I got it
14:36  bartmax: THANK YOU! FIXED :)
14:36  bartmax: linelevel: not sure how/why :)
14:36  PY1NB: from parent, can I access an element inside an iframe?
14:36  bartmax: linelevel: but now, no error is thrown
14:37  bartmax: actually, now i got it :) if ($this.attr('for')) this fixed the issue
14:37  bartmax: i guess i was getting elements without for attribute and not checking for empty values
14:38  linelevel: bartmax: odd, . operator has higher precedence than + anyway, but glad it's working
14:40  RTPMatt: PY1NB: yes you can access it
14:40 @sean`: lol
14:40  PY1NB: RTPMatt: something like ? $('iframe * #widgetcontainer').attr('scrollHeight');
14:40 @sean`: $('iframe').contents ().find ('#widgetcontainer')
14:41  Cork: PY1NB: why on earth would you have iframe * #widgetcontainer ??
14:41 @sean`: best to do var $iframe = $('iframe').contents ();
14:41 @sean`: and thend o $iframe.find ('..')
14:41  Cork: iframe #widgetcontainer will select the same or even just #widgetcontainer
14:41  PY1NB: ahhhh I will try it!
14:41 @sean`: do that!
14:41  PY1NB: but, stuff like scrollHeight, will be preserved?
14:42  RTPMatt: PY1NB: I believe you will have to do something like $('iframe').contents().find('#widgetcontainer').attr('scrollHeight');
14:42 @sean`: No, calculated on acces
14:42 @sean`: RTPMatt, repeat much :p
14:42  PY1NB: hm, ok

15:35  MrJones: is there something like $({'a', 'img'}) ?
15:35  temp01: what would that do?
15:35  Lumpio-: Which would do that
15:35  Lumpio-: what
15:35  Lumpio-: Find both links and images?
15:35  Lumpio-: "a,img"
15:35  Lumpio-: {'a', 'img'} isn't even valid JS syntax :V
15:36  ponty: hi. i m trying to change and get the results of a hidden field. <input id="company_loc" name="company[loc]" type="hidden" /> . tried alert($("#company_loc").val())   . but it says undefined
15:36  MrJones: well if I wanted to do $().hover on both at once :x
15:36  ponty: anybody an idea?
15:36  Lumpio-: MrJones: "a,img" selects both links and images
15:36  MrJones: and how can I select "a,img" and an object I got in a local javascript var?
15:36  RTPMatt: ponty: you dont have a value set on that inout
15:36 --- ejtues is now known as seutje
15:36  MrJones: which I'd usually address using $(var)
15:36  RTPMatt: you need to give it a value="foo"
15:37  RTPMatt: MrJones: $('a, img').add(yourOtherVar)
15:38  ponty: RTPMatt: i did. but that didnt work. that s the mistake. the alert command works but the set command didnT. thx
15:38  diago: is this the correct way to extend a jQuery fn https://gist.github.com/731831
15:39  RTPMatt: ponty: are you sure you are selecting the input correctly?  what happens when you console.log() your selection?
15:39  alaing: ccan I delegate hover?
15:39  MrJones: RTPMatt: so $('a, img').add(myOtherVar).hover(...) would set hover on both of them at once?
15:40  RTPMatt: diago: probably not, toy probably want beforeSend [http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/]
15:40  RTPMatt: MrJones: i believe so
15:41  MrJones: hm
15:41  MrJones: can I make an object (has position: absolute) undetectable by the mouse?
15:41  MrJones: so all hover, click and whatever events just won't go to it but whatever is behind/in front
15:41  klawd: hi!
15:41  klawd: can i get the position of the mouse relative to the element i hover on click?
15:43  RTPMatt: MrJones:
15:43  RTPMatt: MrJones: I dont think so, but you can just not put a hover event on it, and the event will bubble up
15:43  MrJones: um no
15:43  MrJones: well
15:44  MrJones: it is in front of something else
15:44  MrJones: and causes a mouse leave on that something else
15:44  MrJones: which I don't want :x
15:45  ponty: RTPMatt: it seems to work now. console.log too. thx. i was the setter command
15:45  RTPMatt: sure thing
15:45  RTPMatt: MrJones: I'm not sure what your issue is
15:46  MrJones: the issue is
15:46  MrJones: I got a parent with a hover element
15:46  MrJones: *hover event
15:46  MrJones: now there is a position:absolute child div
15:46  MrJones: which is somewhere over the parent in the air (due to position absolute)
15:46  MrJones: when moving with my mouse on the parent, I get a hover event. fine
15:46  gzy: i need to find out scrolltop of a parent window from inside an iframe, is it possible?
15:46  MrJones: but as soon as I move the mouse on the child div, the parent gets a mouse leave
15:47  MrJones: so the child div steals mouse focus
15:47  MrJones: /hover state
15:47  MrJones: and that's odd
15:50  Jonz: Mrjones, you might consider investigating the difference between mouseover/mouseout and mouseenter/mouseleave, as a start
15:51  Jonz: mouseover/mouseout are standard DOM events, mouseenter/mouseleave are events created by the framework, as I understand it
15:51  RTPMatt: Jonz: that is my thinking as well, i'm still not exactly sure what the problem is
15:52  MrJones: Jonz: so what do you suggest I should use? :x
15:52  Jonz: mrjones, I don't know what your goal is, also don't have time to help troubleshoot, just wanted to throw my two cents in to get you headed in the right direction, go read the docs and all will be made clear
15:54  JuJuBee: sean`:  sorry, had to step out.  Did you get a chance to look at https://www.q3ait.org/ajax/TESTING/

16:01  qask: hi
16:01  MrJones: Jonz: it doesn't make a difference apparently
16:01  ajpiano: yeah, but if you plan on using the element, doing var myel = $("#myel");  if (myel.length) { myel.foo() } makes more sense
16:01  SugaSlide: is proxy the right thing to use? i have a plugin that basicaly takes an element and changes it to another element..
16:01  ajpiano: SugaSlide huh
16:01  SugaSlide: but want to try add the bind stuff from the origional to the new 1
16:01  ajpiano: $.proxy is for scope manipulation
16:02  SugaSlide: hmm my plugin takes a select menu.. changes it to a hidden field
16:02  SugaSlide: builds the ul stuff
16:02  mekwall: meh, bug with jquery ui dialog (modal) and animations in webkit... the first time it's run the animated dialog is behind the modal background
16:02  SugaSlide: want to do somehting like $("el").selectbox().change()
16:02  SugaSlide: the .change is on the <select>
16:03  SugaSlide: the plugin .removes() the origional... and renames the hidden to the origional
16:03  ajpiano: you should use the ui widget factory
16:03  SugaSlide: hmm
16:04  qask: I have some div-tags like this:  <div class="prefix1-1"></div><div class="prefix2-1"></div><div class="prefix1-2"></div><div class="prefix2-2"></div> ... is it possible to grep only the div-tags, that uses the prefix "prefix1" in its class-name?

16:35  ajpiano: it's fine to store functions on a jquery plpugin, just that finding ways to then call them is not always fun
16:35  ShawnRisk: I am so confused with my problem, and not sure how to fix this
16:36  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: right click on something on the page and select "inspect element" and it will take you to that place in the page on the HTML tab
16:36  mekwall: ablomen: actually it's not needed :)
16:36  mekwall: just remove it
16:36  ablomen: mekwall, cause if you run it on more then one element now, yourObj.$this etc gets overwritten, which might give unexpected results depending on the rest of the code
16:36  ajpiano: mekwall: i saw this yesterday
16:37  ajpiano: tbh
16:37  ajpiano: i'm not sure why wouldn't just use the jquery ui widget factory
16:37  mekwall: ajpiano: yeah, it's nearly the same
16:37  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: ok I see the newly added row now in the live view.  How do I get that added so that If I post the form again, it will be included?
16:37  mekwall: ajpiano: dunno, haven't really looked inte it... I thought it was only for building jquery ui-like widgets ;)
16:37  ajpiano: mekwall, it's REALLY bad to store properities on dom elements directly.
16:37  ajpiano: like, really really really bad
16:38  ajpiano: which is what you're doing
16:38  ajpiano: that's why jquery.data exists
16:38  JuJuBee: RTPMatt:  i used $("#classList").append(response.newClass); to add it to the table
16:38  mekwall: ajpiano: yeah, I'm gonna put em in data
16:38  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: I have no idea what you are doing, I wasn't paying attention, but if it is inside your form tag, it should be posted
16:38  JuJuBee: It isn't
16:38  ajpiano: mekwall, yeah, they're jquery ui like in the sense that like, they're stateful and have a consistent api for stuff
16:38  ajpiano: not like...they look like jquery ui widgets or anything by default
16:38  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: is this an ajax post or a regular post?
16:38  JuJuBee: I have demo http://localhost/~knichel/ait/ajax/TESTING/  try click new class
16:38  s34n: which browsers don't support DELETE and/or PUT in an XMLHttpRequest?
16:38  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: ajax
16:39  mekwall: updated
16:39  JuJuBee: then try to delete new class
16:39  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: you are the only person who can see what is on http://localhost
16:39  mekwall: ajpiano: it was just a temporary solution to store it on the dom
16:39  ajpiano: ok
16:39  ShawnRisk: I am trying to upgrade http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/ to include bounce effect but I have tried a number of different code and nothing is working. nextslide.effect("bounce", { times:3 }, 300, function(){$.inAnimation = false;});  Any thoughts?
16:39  mekwall: wanted to see if the whole handleCall did work out
16:39  mekwall: which it did :)
16:40  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: make sure it is inside the <form> </form> if you do, it should work
16:41  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: sorry, meant https://q3ait.org/ajax/TESTING/
16:41  crab: hmm. i don't understand how jquery plugins work yet. but i think i need to learn.
16:43  RTPMatt: JuJuBee: your form tags are not correct
16:43  ajpiano: crab, it's pretty straightforward, it gets a construted set of elemensta dn you iterate through it and do whatever you want
16:43  developerhealey: Got a question...   does $.post() allow you to set target="_self" so that page will forward?
16:43  ajpiano: huh
16:43  cohitre: developerhealey: $.post doesn't forward, that's the point
16:43  developerhealey: I KNOW
16:43  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: I just saw that...

16:44  cohitre: if it's forwarding it may be that you have to preventDefault on your form submit event
16:44  developerhealey: is there a dynamic way rather than making a hidden form and using submit
16:44  crab: yeah. my plan is to take the combobox widget from the ui examples and dissect it to understand how it works. i need to use it, anyway.
16:44  cohitre: developerhealey: don't handle it with ajax. let the browser do it
16:44  lanmower: hey guys
16:44  developerhealey: Im doing everything ajax... but i need to send a get variable to the next page (and i dont want to use GET)
16:45  developerhealey: So i guess ill just hide a form in the page, set the variable, and use $.submit
16:46  DAElectric: hmm the links the bots give for jquery ui documentation are wrong

16:48  DAElectric: temp01: so it just looks like how you query them
16:48  temp01: the first link wasn't wrong though
16:48  temp01: it's just jquery.com vs jqueryui.com
16:49  DAElectric: temp01: it didnt work? it didn't like to anything but an error
16:49  PointMan: how can I in jquery traverse my simple json set? "{"1":2,"3":4}"  Im trying to say "{"1":2,"3":4}" .each_pair k,v $(k).html(v)

17:04  aleray: hi, is there a way use different css on two jquery ui widgets?
17:05  oojacoboo: aleray: assign a class to a parent container
17:05  Billy1: cohitre, no just jquery
17:06  aleray: oojacoboo, but then I have to overwrite the default styles...
17:06  oojacoboo: aleray: no, you just override the default styles
17:06  aleray: oojacoboo, that's what I meant
17:07  oojacoboo: aleray: yep, that's jquery ui in all it's great bloated glory
17:07  oojacoboo: you could add a class to the element in your js function as well
17:07  semaphore: not as bloated as extjs
17:07  oojacoboo: or remove any unwanted ones
17:07  oojacoboo: semaphore: they are all bloated, always will be

17:10  b-lew: any way i can get some help on a single input validation?
17:11  JuJuBee: RTPMatt: thanks for looking that did the trick
17:12  DAElectric: b-lew: think you need to give more information on what you are trying to validate it to be . http://devzone.zend.com/article/1113
17:13  b1lly: how come its not adding the rows to the table? http://pastebin.com/yrWf9Si3

17:13  b-lew: i'm not too hot at this stuff.
17:13  b-lew: trying to get better but the light isn't coming on
17:15  DAElectric: b-lew: looks like your just trying to validate it client side.
17:15  oojacoboo: can someone please tell me why jquery ui css doesn't include border-radius styles without the prefixes??
17:15  b-lew: DAElectric yea. i just want it to validate the one field

17:15 @bot-t: b-lew, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
17:16  DAElectric: b-lew: this can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you
17:16  b-lew: humm okay.
17:16  b-lew: seems like overkill for one input but i'll take a look
17:16  DAElectric: i was imagining that your form would not stay one little input field

17:17  b-lew: haha nope it will just got grab a email
17:17  ajpiano: oojacoboo, border radius works in moz webkit opera w/o a prefix
17:17  dilvie: b-lew: also consider h5Validate: http://ericleads.com/h5validate/
17:17  b-lew: oh html5 nice
17:17  b-lew: okay
17:17  b-lew: thanks
17:17  oojacoboo: ajpiano: I know, so why doesnt' the css file have it overriding without the prefix!
17:18  ajpiano: huh?
17:18  oojacoboo: ajpiano http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
17:18  oojacoboo: n/m :/
17:18  oojacoboo: it's written correctly now
17:18  oojacoboo: it wasn't in the current one I have
17:19  ajpiano: oojacoboo, when you say bloated, btw...
17:19  ajpiano: what would you remove from jquery ui
17:19  oojacoboo: ajpiano: everything I don't want to use for my project
17:19  ajpiano: so don't include it
17:19  oojacoboo: easier said than done
17:19  ajpiano: like what
17:19  oojacoboo: like, I gotta go through this stylesheet and figure out what gets included and what doesn't
17:20  ajpiano: you odn't have to use the ui-all
17:20  ajpiano: you can build your own custom distro
17:20  HideMe: Anyone here good with CSS and have time to look at something for me?
17:20  oojacoboo: ajpiano: say I want to use the datepicker

17:20  oojacoboo: but I don't want to have all these other classes
17:20  HideMe: I'm trying to create a minimum height on a div (385px), but also need it to scale if content within the div exceeds 385px.  Can somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong?  example here:  http://www.osequal.com/test/
17:20  ajpiano: which other classes?
17:20  oojacoboo: it's not setup to allow that level of granularity
17:21  oojacoboo: in the link I sent earlier
17:21  oojacoboo: the css files, 2 of them
17:21  ajpiano: jquery ui requires like, some portion of th e css framework to ... work
17:21  oojacoboo: yes, I realize that
17:21  ajpiano: oojacoboo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.datepicker.css
17:21  ajpiano: you don't have like, pull apart that gigantic stylesheet yourself
17:22  oojacoboo: ajpiano: sweet
17:22  oojacoboo: is there a repo of these?
17:22  ajpiano: that's what i am saying man
17:22  ajpiano: have you even tried using the ui download builder?
17:22  ajpiano: it includes a dev bundle
17:22  ajpiano: with everything separate
17:22  ajpiano: oojacoboo, you're looking at a github repository
17:22  oojacoboo: yea, takes me about 45 min to update it when a new jquery release comes up and core needs to be updated
17:22  oojacoboo: can't save my theme roller
17:22  ajpiano: oojacoboo, there are ways to approach that issue
17:22  ajpiano: put any overrides to the theme in a separate file
17:23  oojacoboo: please explain :)
17:23  ajpiano: instead of editing the acutal files from themeroller
17:23  ajpiano: that's what i do
17:23  oojacoboo: done
17:23  oojacoboo: yep, did that
17:23  ajpiano: then you can just pull the theme again....
17:23 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:23  ajpiano: and it should be ok
17:23  dilvie: b-lew: for your problem, you could just do <input type="text" class="h5-email" required /> and then paste $('form').h5Validate(); into your document ready function.
17:23  oojacoboo: but I still have to go back through the theme roller and setup all the right colors
17:23  dinosaadeh: guys anyone did http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable with discrete intervals? this way i can create a scrollbar and know how many sections a user scrolled
17:23  ajpiano: oojacoboo no you don't
17:23  ajpiano: oojacoboo if you look at your ui.theme.css
17:23  ajpiano: there is a URL
17:23  ajpiano: you paste the url
17:23  serio: HideMe, your issue stems from your floats
17:23  ajpiano: and it rebuilds the entire theme.
17:23  oojacoboo: the color stylesheet I have doesn't look even close
17:23  serio: and they way you have this all set up.
17:24  oojacoboo: ajpiano: interesting
17:24  ajpiano: yeah
17:24  ajpiano: i feel very bad if you have been manually rebuilding your theme on every releasse
17:24  ajpiano: and maybe we need to do some more work to make that fact more visible
17:24  oojacoboo: ajpiano: yea, I have, glad to know this
17:24  ajpiano: cause you can just like, take the url and rebuild the entire theme, it's pretty straightforward
17:24  oojacoboo: ajpiano: usernames and saved themes would be awesome!
17:24  oojacoboo: even a theme gallery would be cool
17:25  serio: HideMe, this is quite the mess indeed.
17:25  ajpiano: all themes are saved via the permalink!!!

17:25  b-lew: thats pretty sweet dilvie
17:25  b-lew: thanks for the help
17:25  oojacoboo: ajpiano: yea, I was trying to think of a good use for it, being a custom user created gallery
17:26  oojacoboo: but w/e, might not be worth it
17:26  b-lew: html5 seems awesome. not for sure i understand what makes it so sweet but… i'm down with it
17:26  oojacoboo: ajpiano: props on the longest url on the web :P
17:27  ajpiano: :)
17:27  oojacoboo: what's the limit, I forget
17:27  dilvie: b-lew: Well, for one thing, it makes form validation really easy. It used to actually be a pretty complex problem, using different validation rules on the client and server side. With html5, the server sends the validation rules to the client right with the form fields themselves, which keeps things nice and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
17:28  dilvie: there are lots of other cool HTML5 changes
17:28  entr: guys, fast question
17:28  timing: how do you guys make a popup menu which hides when clicking outside of that menu?
17:28  timing: with a mousedown on document?
17:28  dilvie: but that's the one I'm most excited about right now, because you can use it right now and it works everywhere (if you're using h5Validate -- tested on a TON of browsers, including mobile).
17:28  b-lew: why would html5 change all of this . i don't get it but i know i like it a lot!
17:28  entr: while in anonymous event function (e) { ... }
17:28  timing: or is there a clickEveryWhereElse event?
17:29  entr: this returns the current trigger element
17:29  b1lly: is there a way to drop an element... for example <td class="dropme">arg</td>            $(".dropme").empty()   this clears the data inside it but dont drop the td all together
17:29  ajpiano: ?remove @ b1lly
17:29 @bot-t: b1lly, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
17:29  oojacoboo: ajpiano: the theme roller does allow you to choose your "modules" now
17:29  entr: but what if i have selector that matches more than one like all $('a').click(function(){}), how to reference all matches inside the function
17:30  ajpiano: oojacoboo, it's been like that some time
17:30  oojacoboo: ajpiano: very nice work
17:30  dilvie: b-lew: HTML5 just set a universal standard for us to rely on. So we're all doing things the same way now. Validation used to be all over the map.. people using all kinds of different methods to validate inputs. Now it's standardized. That's really the biggest difference in terms of form validation.
17:30  ajpiano: :)
17:30  oojacoboo: ajpiano: it's been some time ;)
17:30  ajpiano: heh
17:30  dilvie: b-lew: I wrote a blog post on the topic of form validation in HTML5 here: http://ericleads.com/2010/11/html5-form-validation/
17:30  DAElectric: http://daelectric.no-ip.org/hd/HD/NavCustomization.aspx   I seem to be having an issue on line 208   when you click on one of the edit header buttons it doesn't set the appropriate select to have the right value
17:31  serio: entr, you reference $( this ) or this.
17:31  johnathanb: I need to AJAX-ify an array. How?
17:31  dilvie: b-lew: it's a pretty good overview on why it's a good thing that you can now attach validation rules to your HTML in a standardized way.
17:31  serio: not entirely sure what you're trying to do.
17:31  b-lew: yea thats great!
17:31  ajpiano: entr, do like this...
17:31  johnathanb: So we got this auto complete stuff going on and it takes everything from an array (I think) and we kneed to get stuff from a database as a user is typing into a form to build the array.
17:32  ajpiano: var anchors = $("a").click(function() { anchors.foo();   });
17:32  ajpiano: entr ^^
17:32  entr: ajpiano, right
17:32  entr: should have thought of this

17:33  serio: ajpiano is pro at abstracting what people are really asking.
17:33  ajpiano: johnathanb, what do you mean "Ajaxify" an array
17:33 * serio is not so pro
17:34  ajpiano: you mean, send it as a parameter to an ajax call?
17:34  ajpiano: you can json stringify it, or just do array join and send it as a simple string
17:34  johnathanb: Erm, not sure :/
17:34  ajpiano: lol
17:34  johnathanb: I want an auto complete form field that pulls info from a database as I type.

17:35  b-lew: man you guys are smart
17:35  b-lew: i'm pretty jealous
17:36  johnathanb: We have an auto complete thing in place already, we just need a way to dynamically generate the array it's using as a user types into the text input
17:36  johnathanb: http://d.pr/CpVA
17:36  HideMe: serio Mmmm now I have the content hidden under the float.  :\
17:36  johnathanb: That's the array it's using at the minute.
17:37  ajpiano: are you usng the jquery ui autocomplete?
17:37  ajpiano: looks like it
17:37  johnathanb: No idea, someone else implemented it, I just get to make it work properly :D.. -_-
17:37  ajpiano: johnathanb, you realise that when asking strangers for help, having details and ....a clue, helps a lot
17:38  johnathanb: I do, but to be honest that's all you need to know.
17:38  ajpiano: if you want to ask questions like that, ask other people at your job
17:38  ajpiano: oh, is it?
17:38  ajpiano: fine
17:38  ajpiano: "do some ajax"
17:38  serio: HideMe, you need to learn what float actually does and how to use it.
17:38  ajpiano: that's all you need to know
17:38  johnathanb: You need to know I have a static array and I want it to be dynamic. It doesn't matter what I'm using it for.
17:38  ajpiano: lol
17:38  ajpiano: so the timing of the request
17:38  DAElectric: ajpiano: lol
17:38  ajpiano: when it happens with respect to typing in the box, etc
17:38  ajpiano: all those things are irrelevant
17:38  ajpiano: i forgot
17:39  Ryro: ajpiano: you're my hero
17:39  ajpiano: johnathanb, "how do i make an array dynamic" is not an actual question
17:39  ajpiano: you should go ask the "someone else" who implmeneted it how they would do it.
17:39  johnathanb: Ok, how do I make an array dynamic?
17:39  johnathanb: That's a question.
17:40  ajpiano: johnathanb. don't waste people's time.
17:40  johnathanb: Well they wouldn't which is why I'm doing it.
17:40  serio: arr.dynamify();
17:40  DAElectric: johnathanb: the documentation that ajpiano linked you to has examples for doing ajax request with the autocomplete plugin. did you actualy look at it or just dismiss it as soon as it was posted to you. being the php guy instead of the javascript guy
17:40  ajpiano: they "wouldnt'?"
17:40  ajpiano: Ryro, you are mine :)
17:40  johnathanb: I just dismissed it.
17:40  ajpiano: thanks
17:40  johnathanb: They wouldn't/couldn't/didn't one of them.
17:40  ajpiano: i really appreciate that
17:40  ajpiano: well
17:40  ajpiano:  guess what PHP guy
17:40  ajpiano: you have to look at examples
17:41  ajpiano: and use them.
17:41  ajpiano: if i was writing php and someone gave me a link to an example of exactly what i wanted to do in php
17:41  ajpiano: i wouldn't dismiss it, because i'm a javascript guy.
17:41  johnathanb: Who said I dismissed it because I'm a PHP guy?
17:41  ajpiano: oh
17:41  johnathanb: I dismissed it because I'm not a documentation guy ;)
17:42  ajpiano: oh

17:46  serio: how is that any different?
17:46  serio: exactly?
17:46 * ajpiano is done
17:46  ajpiano: gluck figuring out how to "make an array dynamic"
17:46  johnathanb: No, it's making an array dynamically
17:46  serio: aren't array's dynamic to begin with?
17:46  serio: haha
17:46  serio: OOOOH
17:46  ajpiano: johnathanb, from an ajax call.
17:46  johnathanb: Well not if I type it out by hand.
17:47  ajpiano: which you have no idea when to invoke based on the autocomplete...
17:47  ajpiano: but you don't know ANYTHING bout the autocompltee widget you're using
17:47  ajpiano: which means there is no generic answer to your question
17:47  ajpiano: aside from "use ajax"
17:47  serio: flame on
17:48  johnathanb: Well.. What I need to do is make jQuery listen for when I type stuff, send that stuff from a page, get a test response or something back assigning it to a variable :D
17:48  pallet[1]: I need a way to copy the contents of <textarea id="wscript" to the copy/paste buffer, can someone help me with that please
17:48  johnathanb: I could be using that array for anything.
17:48  ajpiano: johnathanb, do you know what json is
17:48  johnathanb: I do.
17:48  ajpiano: do you know what a keyup event is in jquery
17:48  johnathanb: I don't.
17:48  ajpiano: ?keyup
17:48 @bot-t: .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
17:49  Billy1: any idea when i do a $('[name=actionType]').val('changemode'); alert($('[name=actionType]').val()); in IE it shows actiontype as blank
17:49  ajpiano: but i am almost willing to guarantee that there is a way of doing the ajax natively in your autocomplete if you would like
17:49  ajpiano: even bother to find out anything about it
17:50  ajpiano: but why should you need to know anything about the strucutre of your application, that's what strangers on the internet are for.
17:50  johnathanb: I do know about the structure of the application.
17:50  johnathanb: Well sorta know.
17:50  bartmax: Billy1: should be $('[name="'+ actionType + "')
17:50  ajpiano: you don't know which autocomplete widget you're using
17:50  ajpiano: which you could find out rather easily
17:51  johnathanb: In fact. You're probably right. On a whole I know very little about it. Also it's home time in 10 minutes and need to get tidied up before I go so I'll be back to  be "difficult" tomorrow. Maybe with more information depending on what I can get out of the powers that be.
17:51  Billy1: bartmax, why when im setting the value of the form input
17:51  johnathanb: bubbi
17:51  Billy1: the inputs name is "actionType"
17:51  bartmax: then it should be $('[name="actionType"]')
17:52  pallet[1]: I need a way to copy the contents of <textarea id="wscript" to the copy/paste buffer, can someone help me with that please
17:52  Billy1: same problem
17:52  ajpiano: yes, you can.
17:53  ajpiano: ?lmgtfy javascript copy and paste @ pallet[1]
17:53 @bot-t: pallet[1], http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+copy+and+paste
17:53  bartmax: actionType is a button ?
17:53  Billy1: no
17:53  Billy1: its a text input
17:53  xeen_: I think only IE lets you dick around with the copy/paste buffer without flash pallet[1]
17:54  bartmax: Billy1: case is correct? it should work.
17:54  Billy1: yes case is correct, works fine in every browser except IE
17:55  bartmax: Billy1: weird, i think ajpiano can help you out with that one... sorry
17:55  zfmf: why this doesnt work : $('input[type="text"]').each(function() {alert($(this).val()); }); ??
17:55  bartmax: Billy1: never had this problem on ie
17:55  Billy1: its cool, thanks for trying
17:55  ajpiano: i donno
17:55  bartmax: zfmf: looks like having the same problem as Billy1
17:55  Sidhy: hmm
17:55  oojacoboo: ajpiano: how would I go about utilizing the core css from the google cdn while maintaining my own theme?
17:55  Billy1: the form and javascript is loaded into a div using ajax
17:56  oojacoboo: is there a certain part of the generated stylesheet I can isolate?
17:56  ajpiano: oojacoboo, you could include the entire google css and then your own theme after
17:56  Sidhy: is there something to crossfade the background image from a page ?
17:56  Sidhy: I mean the body background
17:56  ajpiano: oojacoboo then you're loading a lot of extra css for no real reason
17:56  Sidhy: found a plugin to fade images ..
17:56  oojacoboo: ajpiano: the two files are separated out in any fashion
17:57  Sidhy: but it does not crossfade body backgrounds
17:57  ajpiano: not on google...
17:57  Lumpio-: ...how would one even cross-fade backgrounds
17:57  oojacoboo: ajpiano: I just mean the theme elements, aka, colors
17:58  oojacoboo: or, are they all intermixed
17:58  ajpiano: oojacoboo, you should be able to just use the ui.theme.css from your download
17:58  ajpiano: no, they are not intermixed
17:58  ajpiano: everything that's like, specific to your theme is located in one place in the file
17:58  ajpiano: everything for the widgets and stuff is purely structural
17:58  oojacoboo: jquery-ui-1.8.6.custom.css is what I have ajpiano
17:58  igor_111: if i get elements in $('#rotate li:visible') which order will they have? random or same as in the dom tree?
17:59  ajpiano: oojacoboo, what is the point of loading it from google if you have a custom build that contains what you need in it
17:59  oojacoboo: ajpiano: less loaded from this server, granted it's another request, but less from this end
17:59  ajpiano: oojacoboo, put your entire custom css thing in a pste
17:59  ajpiano: paste
18:00  ajpiano: i'll take out the parts you don't need
18:00  ajpiano: but it's kinda silly
18:00  oojacoboo: ajpiano: na, that's not what I mean, but I appreciate it
18:00  ajpiano: cause then you're gonna load a larger file from google
18:00  oojacoboo: I just thought there was a core css sheet
18:00  ajpiano: oojacoboo,  in what you downloaded
18:00  ajpiano: there should also be all the files broken out separately.
18:00  oojacoboo: that could be updated without having to change the colors one
18:00  ajpiano: look in the developmen bundle
18:01  oojacoboo: ajpiano: also, google cdn hosts the images
18:01  oojacoboo: that saves another 4-5 requests
18:01  ajpiano: true
18:01  oojacoboo: ajpiano: I guess what I really want is...
18:01  oojacoboo: google cdn core, small tight color override
18:01  oojacoboo: local override
18:01  ajpiano: so just do that :)
18:02 * oojacoboo is asking how
18:02  ajpiano: make another css file
18:02  oojacoboo: the sheet I get from the theme roller has everything put toghter
18:02  ajpiano: so show me the sheet
18:02  oojacoboo: ok
18:02  ajpiano: and i wlil take out the superfluous parts
18:02  ajpiano: that is what i was saying

18:03 --- seutje is now known as frigginGone
18:03  oojacoboo: ajpiano: wouldn't it be nice to separate out this file based on this intention?
18:04  ajpiano: oojacoboo, i am telling you, the package you downloaded already has it
18:04  oojacoboo: like, just the color overrides at the bottom, and all the core stuff at the top that 99% of people dont' want to touch
18:04  ajpiano: but you are just not finding it.
18:04  oojacoboo: :/
18:04  ajpiano: and they *are* broken out
18:04  ajpiano: just not with the theme stuff at the bottom
18:05  ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/6zvLVeqS
18:05  oojacoboo: ajpiano: I see in the development-bundle
18:05  pallet[1]: oh, FF doesn't allow the copy Option
18:05  ajpiano: yes, that is what i was saying
18:05  oojacoboo: ajpiano: sorry, didn't see that
18:06  oojacoboo: ajpiano: cheers for that anyway
18:06  ajpiano: :)
18:06  ajpiano: what's in that paste and what's in the ui-theme css in your dev bundle should be pretty much the same
18:06 --- mfer is now known as mfer-lunch
18:06  oojacoboo: yea, figured
18:07  oojacoboo: ajpiano: ui-theme includes all the background-position styles and border-radius items
18:07  oojacoboo: but other than that, looks the same
18:07  ajpiano: yeah
18:08  ajpiano: cause i knew that you didn't want to be pulling images locally i ommited that
18:08  oojacoboo: yep
18:08  oojacoboo: thanks man
18:08  ajpiano: border radius should be there though yes, cause it's part of your theme
18:08  ajpiano: no problem
18:08  ajpiano: oojacoboo, just tell your friends how nice the jquery ui team is
18:08  ajpiano: :)
18:08  oojacoboo: haha, yep
18:14  aro: whats the difference between keypress and keydown
18:15  mortana: morning folks
18:15  aro: hai
18:15  mortana: how can I serialize all checkboxes in a div container?
18:15 @bot-t: JavaScript - Detecting keystrokes - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
18:16  mortana: I'm using $(div).serializeObject
18:16 @bot-t: mortana, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
18:16  aro: add a form
18:16  mortana: but it gives me an empty object
18:16  mortana: aaaah
18:16  aro: $.serialize()
18:16  mortana: lol
18:16 @bot-t: $('div').find('input').serialize()
18:16  mortana: thanks man
18:16  wunderkin: ('input:checkbox') ?
18:17  wunderkin: if you need to be more specific
18:17  aro: $('div#divid input:checkbox')
18:17  wunderkin: or :checked for all checked ;D
18:17  aro: then you could use filter and map too
18:17  aro: theres a million ways to do it
18:18  mortana: well, I'm used to serializeObject, but that failed since there were no form tags
18:18  mortana: but the find().serialize works great
18:18  akahn: aro: keydown is depressing a key, keypress is depressing and releasing a key
18:18  mortana: thanks fellas!
18:18 @sean`: aro, FUUU
18:18  ip-route: hi
18:18  mortana: hi
18:19 @sean`: aro, don't do tag#id
18:19 @sean`: juts do #id
18:19  DAElectric: why is there a keypress and a keyup then sounds overkill
18:19  ajpiano: keyup is releasing a key
18:19  aro: yeah i realised that after i said it sean` :)
18:19  ajpiano: DAElectric, the value of the input is different depending on which event you use
18:20 @sean`: DAElectric, 'cuz keypress is something else
18:20  aro: but thats also assuming that users dont have duplicate #id's - which several times a week i still see duplicates
18:20  ajpiano: like, you can't prevent the action in keyup, and you cna't get the new value in a keydown
18:20  ip-route: $('#toconcatestringid'+my_id+'').length  // because this don't work on ie8 ?
18:20 @bot-t: mortana, .find().serializeObject() should work too
18:20 @sean`: it'll fire non stop if you keep pressing
18:20  ip-route: on FF work fine
18:20 @sean`: bot-t, what do you know!
18:20 @bot-t: sean`, Ask again later.
18:20 @sean`: wasn't a question!
18:20  DragoneneWork2: any thoughts on why my $(document).ready(function() {}); is run twice?
18:20 @sean`: DragoneneWork2, give use ?Details
18:20 @bot-t: DragoneneWork2, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
18:21 @bot-t: DragoneneWork2, are you using 1.4.3?
18:21  mortana: bot-t
18:21 @bot-t: mortana
18:21  mortana: hahaha
18:22  DragoneneWork2: sean`: Well, I'm reluctant to paste all of the code as it's a php/js combination that's rather tricky to read
18:22 @sean`: well
18:22  Krinkle: I remember from 1.4 alpha 1 there was a supposedly working cross-browser support for live( "submit" ), did this make it into the real version ? I can't find it anywhyere in the documentation
18:22 @sean`: don't paste all of it, just relevant
18:22 @bot-t: Krinkle, Yes, it did.
18:22  DragoneneWork2: yeah, that's easier said than done ;)
18:22  ajpiano: Krinkle, yes, live submit works
18:22  Krinkle: Even in IE6 ?
18:22  DragoneneWork2: hm, is there such a thing as a JS callstack?
18:22  DragoneneWork2: I could try to figure out where its run from.
18:23  Krinkle: Wow, I can't explain how that joys me. Friggin live submit handling.
18:23 @sean`: DragoneneWork2, add console.log ('foo');
18:24 @sean`: DragoneneWork2, do you have $(function () { $(document).ready (function () { }); });
18:24 @sean`: by any chance?
18:24 @bot-t: DragoneneWork2, why you gotta ignore my question
18:25  DragoneneWork2: nope. I found the issue, though, fortunately!
18:25 @sean`: what was it :O |
18:25  DragoneneWork2: bot-t: I wasn't ignoring it. Aren't you a bot?
18:25 @bot-t: DragoneneWork2, Ask again later.
18:25 @sean`: :O-|-<
18:25 @bot-t: Yes, and?
18:25 * wunderkin shakes bot-t
18:25  DragoneneWork2: sean`: eh, I had a javascript error somewhere that I had missed when browsing errors
18:26 @sean`: hah
18:26  DragoneneWork2: it was hidden among a bunch of jquery errors
18:26  DragoneneWork2: and apparently that caused opera to run in such a way that the document.ready was run twice
18:26 @sean`: and you were like
18:26  DragoneneWork2: I have no clue why.
18:26 @sean`: awh, this script is erroring out all over the place
18:26 @sean`: but, I want to fix that douoble document ready!
18:26  l4rk: lol ie 8 has a fade bug when an image under an li has position relative or absolute the li will not fade
18:26  l4rk: such bs
18:26  DragoneneWork2: no, I didn't see the error at all sean`
18:26  DragoneneWork2: It was an element getter that used id 0 instead of 1
18:27  DragoneneWork2: that caused me to get null instead of an <option> tag, which in turn gave me errors. :)
18:27 @sean`: Sucks when you run out of <options>
18:28  kojiro: sean`: lol
18:28  serio: What are peoples thought on jQuery tools?
18:28  DragoneneWork2: sean`: >)
18:28  serio: *thoughts*
18:28 @sean`: Can I not have one?
18:28  kojiro: serio: well, most jQuery users are nice.
18:28  DragoneneWork2: alright, I'm out :)

19:28  Nomikos: Otherwise they might conflict?
19:32  Ryro: looking at code to remember how i did this once, it was a while ago and my code was pretty ugly
19:32  Nomikos: Ryro: okies. I'll see if I can get it to work

20:03  vvuksan: ajpiano: yes

20:03  guggero: Thanks for that
20:03  freedgy: mrittman: always   $(element) , so in your case $('li:first').not(   maybe?
20:03  vvuksan: ajpiano: i didn't see anything that says onTabClose or similar
20:04  esparkman: hey guys is it possible to chain css options together from the .css action
20:04  ajpiano: vvuksan: why don't you actually read the event descriptions
20:04  vvuksan: ajpiano: there is show
20:04  ajpiano: excatly
20:04  ajpiano: and when one is shown, the other one is closed.
20:04  igor_111: i'm not doing anything wrong, i get my element into variable, check it's value in debugger . it's a jquery 'li' object. then get .next() for it.  - empty obj that's it
20:04  ajpiano: igor_111: yes, you are.
20:04  ajpiano: maybe there is no next sibling
20:05  serio: igor_111, did you look at the example I pasted?
20:05  serio: cuz like, that's how you use it.
20:05  ajpiano: igor_111, jQuery's .next() method works just fine, and if you continue to insist that it doesn't.... no one will listen to you
20:05  RTPMatt:  esparkman: sure, you can also pass it an object and set multiple ones at one time
20:05  vvuksan: ajpiano: thanks
20:06  esparkman: RTPMatt: would it look something like .css('param', 'value', 'param', 'value')
20:06  nuba: hey folks, what do you use to debug js in IE7 ?
20:06 * nuba hates being in this position, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...
20:06  ajpiano: nuba, you can use ie8 in ie7 mode
20:07  ajpiano: or you can use microsoft script debugger or visual webdeveloper etc
20:07  mrittman: freedgy, any idea how to get it working on parent pages and ancestor pages?
20:07  RTPMatt: esparkman: like this: .css({'p': 'v', 'p2', 'v2'});
20:07  Lumpio-: That's not even valid JS
20:07  nuba: do i get anything remotely resembling the debugging facilities I have with chrome and firefow with ie8 ?
20:07  caludio: nuba, does anything happen when you  hit F12 in your IE?
20:07  ajpiano: nuba, yes
20:07  RTPMatt: err, like this: .css({'p': 'v', 'p2': 'v2'});.
20:08  esparkman: RTPMatt: so the first param.....lol ok :)
20:08  ajpiano: nuba, you just can't interact with the page, and the console api is like, pretty much nothing but .log
20:08  ajpiano: but there's a debugger and a watch window and all that shit
20:08  nuba: coolio! thanks a lot ajpiano!
20:08  nuba: caludio: nothing happens with F12

20:22  Jarda: (there's numerous ways to set text as bold, so matching tagname etc isn't enough)
20:22  mrittman: it breaks where the two lines of code are indented but I can't figure it out
20:22  Peec: Anyone tried Valums Ajax Upload (http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) ? I have problems setting fileName to the new fileName on the server side. Everything is nice on the server side.

20:22  Peec: list!
20:23  serio: Jarda, like you said, it depends
20:23  serio: you can check the css of the element
20:23  Jarda: serio: what I would like to, is to somehow check the internal representation of the element, to see what it's font-weight is
20:23  t3uth: http://shadowpark.we.bs/test/ looking for an answer as to why my scroller dosen't move past panel # 5 :(
20:24  serio: Jarda, we're not talking about <b> or <strong> tags here are we?
20:24  Jarda: serio: no
20:24  serio: if that's the case, then you just described how to do it.
20:24  PointMan: two conditions in one selector ? $(".container #body") ? if i want a node that both has a container class and the body id ?
20:24  Jarda: serio: what I mean, is that I can have in css .foo { font-weight: bold; }
20:25  ajpiano: PointMan, get rid of the space
20:25  Jarda: so $('p.foo') is bold. but no way to know it?

22:03  Bartzy|work: memory-consumption wise.. and performance wise ?
22:03  ajpiano: Bartzy|work yes
22:03  ajpiano: but if you want the function to work for more than one element, than caching outside doesn't make sense.
22:03  Bartzy|work: you are bad :p
22:03  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: Understood. thanks.
22:03  ajpiano: so both are valid implementations
22:04  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: The memory consumption and performance improvement of the first implementation is noticeable ?
22:04  ajpiano: Bartzy|work, not even close
22:04  Bartzy|work: ok.

22:13  yi: hey guys I'm having an issue with positioning after creating new draggable divs in javascript.  If I create two or more draggable divs and then hide the first div all the other divs will lose their positioning and be shifted up in the page.
22:14  nul: semaphore: the jquery ninjas part and quit every 0.0001ns, hence you don't know they're here
22:14  yi: I have an example here. http://slacks.no-ip.org/adhoc/
22:14  yi: you can see the problem the most if you create a div and then drag it around a bit and the create some more and do the same thing and then hide the first div.
22:15  aro: has anyone seen a problem with jquery ui that when clicking a ui label, it goes to the top of the document?
22:16  eTiger13: aro got an example?
22:16  chmode: what do i use to tell if an object already exist by id selector?
22:16  aro: unfortunately not, its internal :\
22:16  aro: clicking the actual element is fine, but when you click its label, it scrolls the document to the top
22:17  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: thanks for your help.
22:17  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: I animate a element's top by 10px , up and down.. 800ms for each animation (up + down together is 1600ms). Even in chrome it's a bit sluggish... it's because it's so small (only 8px per side?) ?
22:18  ajpiano: yeah
22:18  ajpiano: animating 8 pixels over a second
22:18  ajpiano: almost a second...
22:18  ajpiano: is a long time
22:19  oojacoboo: ajpiano: why is ui-icon position: absolute; ?  As a result of this the containing <button> doesn't know it's own boundaries
22:20  lover: is it possible to prevent text from being selected when double clicking on some element supposed to do something?
22:21  jqStarter: ajpiano: would u be kind check http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data , if i change its data formats, it wont working. i'm really stuck with this old problem
22:21  draginx: http://pastie.org/private/zgf9kpz8y9ms2btdlbkzgw any idea why after one click the .click doesn't work anymore?
22:22  jrockjiggz: we got a lot of snow lastnight http://i.imgur.com/M9sVA.jpg  http://imgur.com/BcE1E.jpg
22:22  draginx: nvm I just changed it to .live('click'
22:22  aro: i do have an example actually
22:23  aro: https://www.anx.com/secure/user/register
22:23  aro: open that in firefox
22:23  ajpiano: jqStarter: if you think i'm insane enough to continue this dicussion you are even more naive than i thought
22:23  aro: scroll down to the 'interests'
22:23  eTiger13: yeah ajpiano its all your fault cc oojacoboo
22:23  ajpiano: eTiger13 it's ok
22:23  aro: oh jesus christmas
22:23  aro: it works in prod
22:23  aro: not in dev
22:23  aro: MF
22:23  aro: nevermind
22:23  oojacoboo: eTiger13: huh :P
22:25  ajpiano: oojacoboo: it's absolute so it can be.. positioned relatively to the actual button
22:25  ajpiano: cause the .ui-button has position relative
22:25  ajpiano: and that is...how it works
22:25  chmode: what do i use to tell if an object already exist by id selector?   if ( $('#addsubmenuitem-'+tabid+'-'+item).length() == 0 ){ } isnt working
22:25  oojacoboo: ajpiano: how does the button get it's sizing though?
22:25  oojacoboo: right now I have a 1px height button
22:26  ajpiano: ?linaf @ chmode
22:26 @bot-t: chmode, .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
22:26  jqStarter: ajpiano : whats the problem? i even dont know it ..should this channel help other?
22:26  ajpiano: jqStarter, i've spent the last three hours (and three years) helping people in here so if you are in the mood to be self-righteous i suggest you take it somewhere else.
22:26  lover: ok, I ask more specifically. I know that -moz-user-select can prevent text selection, but the webkit based browsers and IE, how to do it in those?
22:27  oojacoboo: ajpiano: does this really rely on the extra <span>&nbsp;</span> to be inside the button?
22:27  ajpiano: oojacoboo, are you using the ui-button plugin, or just applying styles manually
22:27  oojacoboo: plugin
22:27  oojacoboo: autocomplete select
22:27  ajpiano: so then why *Wouldn't* the span be there??
22:27  jqStarter: ajpiano : whats my wrong?
22:28  eTiger13: lover: hopes and dreams? that is a more #css appropriate question. you could also check google for an answer
22:28  oojacoboo: ajpiano: I am talking about 2 of them
22:28  nul: if I want to select the table tbody inside div #table_data, is it: $("#table_data table tbody")?
22:28  ajpiano: lover: you should look at jQuery UI's disableSelection method
22:28 --- r0bby is now known as r0bby_
22:28 --- r0bby_ is now known as robbyoconnor
22:28  lover: eTiger13: I'm not sure the CSS way to do it is the answer
22:28  Mr_Nobody: Im stuck at this, this works but it dont want to fetch the whole page, only the contents of a div #contents : http://jsbin.com/edibe/4/edit
22:28  lover: ajpiano: that's a good tip, thanks!
22:29  oojacoboo: ajpiano: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
22:29  oojacoboo: notice that inside that button there are two <span> elemenets
22:29  oojacoboo: also, btw, this renders 1px off in firefox 4
22:29  ajpiano: oojacoboo, yeah, there are two.
22:30  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: perhaps you can help me, we where so close.
22:30  oojacoboo: ajpiano: :/
22:30  yi: is there anyway to have complete control over the positioning of an jquery ui element if the element is created in javascript and poistioned absolutely?
22:30  ajpiano: oojacoboo, i just don't understand what your question is
22:31  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, i have no idea what this.getTip is
22:31  oojacoboo: ajpiano: well, if the extra span must be in there, that kinda solves the issue, but there is still a 1px height difference
22:31  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: Its the tooltip returned as a jquery object
22:31  ajpiano: ohok
22:31  ajpiano: ohh
22:31  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody
22:32  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: I still only want to fetch the content of a specific div inside the returned page
22:32  ajpiano: http://jsbin.com/edibe/5/edit
22:32  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: it works now, but it gets the whole page
22:32  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: What the hell, thats it? Thats all it took to filter the response?
22:32  ajpiano: yup

22:34  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: Hm, it still fetches the whole page
22:36  Mr_Nobody: i must have missed something
22:36  robert1: can you use .is() to check if an element has an effect running it?
22:36  robert1: I want to find out when an element is "fading".
22:36  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: I can just .animate a jquery set of elements ?
22:36  ajpiano: robert1: is(":animated")
22:36  robert1: thanks a lot ajpiano :)
22:37  ajpiano: Bartzy|work, yes.... you noticed?
22:37  ajpiano: this entire exercise is based on that fact.....
22:37  Bartzy|work: I have two elements that needs to be animated together, both top+=10px and then -=10px... but if I cache a jquery element of them both.. the effect is weird...
22:38  nul: what would be the proper jquery selector for the element: <div class="abc"><table><tbody></tbody></table></div>.. I tried $("#abc table tbody")?
22:38  erichynds: .abc tbody
22:38  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: $('#choose_effect > div.arrow_down').add('#choose_effect > div.line:eq(1)') , this is what I cache
22:38  bartmax: anyone uses tagdragon autocomplete ?
22:38  nul: thats it?
22:38  nul: k
22:39  erichynds: yeah bro
22:39  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: It just gets stuck at loading....
22:39  Bartzy|work: actually div.abc.children('tbody') should be better I think ?
22:39  nul: no worky ;(
22:39  nul: ok
22:39  Bartzy|work: $('div.abc).children('tbody');
22:39  erichynds: thats a lie
22:39  Bartzy|work: nul ^
22:39  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: but it fetches the page in firebug
22:39  Bartzy|work: erichynds: Why ?
22:39  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, so DEBUG.
22:39  nul: k
22:39  Bartzy|work: I checked with jsperf
22:39  erichynds: Bartzy|work, that won't work
22:39  Bartzy|work: ohhh right
22:39  Bartzy|work: sorry nul
22:39  erichynds: tbody is not a child of .abc
22:40  Bartzy|work: I'll shut up :p
22:41  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: I noticed it was fetching .text, shouldnt it be fetching .html?
22:41  jqStarter: i have a problem when changing data in http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data, somebody pls your suggestion.( i live in different languange, sorry if i'm too rude anyway or else)
22:41  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, uh, what
22:41  ajpiano: jqStarter: don't link to the demo, link to your actual code
22:42  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: $tip.text($(response).find("#funktion-description"));
22:42  ajpiano: that's not fetching text, it's setting it
22:42  Mr_Nobody: Oh
22:42  ajpiano: but yeah, probably you'd want to set html
22:43  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: now the loading.. text gets replaced, with nothing.
22:43  ajpiano: obviously the $(response).find() isn't working properly
22:43  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, do you know how to debug javascript
22:44  jqStarter: here for code : http://www.jsfiddle.net/vmjue/
22:44  ajpiano: jqStarter: you really don't get it, do you
22:44  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: not a clue, im all new to jquery
22:45  Bartzy|work: ajpiano: any idea about animating 2 elements together ?
22:45  ajpiano: jqStarter, the data that is passed to autocomplete NEEDS TO BE IN THE FORMAT that is provided by the demo... you can't make up your own schema
22:45  ajpiano: jqStarter, that is why the examples all show how to transform arbitrary data into that format with value, label...
22:46  ajpiano: the value and label and desc stuff, is mandatory.

22:49  jqStarter: the demo says "You can use your own custom data formats and displays by simply overriding the default focus and select actions"

22:55  ajpiano: it's some random dudes thing that happens to use jquery ui
22:56  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: what should i be looking for?
22:56  ajpiano: aro, the problem isn't this plugin being compatible with 1.4.4 necessarily, the entire jquery ui 1.7.2 isn't compatible with 1.4
22:56  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, use the firebug console to inspect what happens when you do $(response) or $(response).find("somestuff")
22:56  ajpiano: and see what results
22:56  aro: i am using 1.8.6
22:56  yi: ajpiano: do you know how to set the position of a jquery ui element?  I tried the position method that comes with jquery ui 1.8 but that just lets you position it relative to another element.  I really just want to position the elements statically
22:56  ajpiano: yi: you can position them relative to the window
22:57  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: Ok
22:57  ajpiano: aro: you're using 1.8.6, but this plugin is compatible with the 1.7 widget factory.
22:57  ajpiano: so it won't work with 1.8
22:57  aro: oh
22:57  yi: ajpiano: using the position method or something like 'div.style.left = 50'?
22:57  aro: are there specific elements that can be modified to make it compatible?
22:58  ajpiano: using the position method, you can just do of: document , i believe
22:58  bartmax: ajpiano, <datalist> to jason ? :D ideas ?
22:59  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: Nothing is showing in the console when i reach that breakpoint
22:59  ajpiano: you have to type into the console things
22:59  oojacoboo: ajpiano: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6729
22:59  yi: ajpiano: ok I'll give it a try... the odd thing is it seems to know that there are other absolutley positioned elements on the page and it doesn't want me to put an element on top of another one.

23:08  sentientwaffle: ah, so there isnt a selector. thank you!
23:09  Mr_Nobody: ajpiano: is there no other way, this is taking forever... and its a lot of jibberish
23:09  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, the other option is making a demo that actually shows the problem and having someone else fix it

23:25  DAElectric: if I add a button to the dom via jquery will a load event be triggered?

23:25  atan: One other thing. Can I adjust $('.nav span') to apply to .nav span but NOT .nav ul if the ul has some like, class=noslide?
23:26  DAElectric: didnt think items without a src would trigger one
23:26  ajpiano: Mr_Nobody, cause you have to concat it onto the string for it to make load happy
23:26  ajpiano: right now you're passing that selector as a second argument
23:26  DAElectric: $('.nav span:not(noslide)')
23:26  ajpiano: this.getTip().load(theUrl + "#funktion-description");
23:27  Mr_Nobody: oh
23:27  Mr_Nobody: how silly of me

23:49  DAElectric: coldhead: yeah as soon as html5 comes along with the video tag no one want video anymore
23:50  brimestone: hey JKarsrud: i added it in http://pastebin.com/tFTQTsQd but still doesnt work.. if i can get just one sample i could get it going..
23:51  tjholowaychuk: if you have say div > form > p > input   for $(input).parent('form)
23:51  coldhead: do you know how many videos were watched on youtube in the last month?
23:51  tjholowaychuk: blah sorry
23:51  coldhead: ZERO
23:51  tjholowaychuk: would $(input).parent('form') grab that form?
23:51  coldhead: its a ghetto
23:51  tjholowaychuk: or should I use .closest()?
23:52  RTPMatt: .closest
23:52  tjholowaychuk: k thanks
23:52  dabear: nope
23:53  dabear: .attr("form")
23:53  dabear: input elements have they accociated form in an attribute called form
23:53  bakers: tjholowaychuk: parent() is direct parent
23:53  RTPMatt: you could use .parents()
23:53  nul: I have a table full of information.. it grabs new information via ajax.  I want to have a loading animation inbetween loads.  Anyone know of something existing that is just a nice, simple loading animation?
23:53  RTPMatt: parent() might not work though,
23:53  nul: even a popup is acceptable though
23:54  JKarsrud: ?g ajaxloader
23:54 @bot-t: JKarsrud, Ajaxload - Ajax loading gif generator - http://ajaxload.info/

23:55  nul: JKarsrud: yup.. well I have the image(s), that's not the problem.. I just want something as simple as eg: loadingScreen.Show(); then loadingScreen.Hide(); and throbber is no good though
23:55  tjholowaychuk: dabear: I can in this case, I dont need to use this in the browser
23:56  dabear: I am surprised that so few actually know of $aninput.attr("form")

23:57  tjholowaychuk: dabear: jsdom messes up a lot of things
23:57  tjholowaychuk: .attr() doesnt even work
23:57  tjholowaychuk: for example
23:57 --- jwbuzz is now known as jwbuzz|afk
23:58  tjholowaychuk: I have to .get(0).getAttribute()
