00:00  danheberden: icek - it is?
00:00  ajpiano: m0dmd, by the time it changes, it should already BE the value
00:00  ajpiano: why would that be necessary
00:00  draginx: ajpiano here's what's happening
00:00  draginx: ?
00:00  m0dmd: ajpiano no luck because I don't know how to pass the selected value to jquery as you notice the val(data)
00:00  ajpiano: (e,ui) are the arguments passed to jqueryui callback
00:00  icek: lol it is?
00:00  icek: damn chrome
00:00  icek: cache or somethin
00:00  m0dmd: ajpiano i made the change and checked the source and the value remained empty :(
00:00  m0dmd: ajpiano i don't know how to pass the selected value
00:01  icek: danheberden no its not workin
00:01  m0dmd: ajpiano something interesting, with that code it put [object Object in the input field] but the value="" remained empty
00:01  m0dmd: [object Object]
00:02  ajpiano: m0dmd, that's what i'm trying to explain
00:02  ajpiano: YOULL NEVER SEE THE VALUE ATTRIBUTE UPDATE
00:02  ajpiano: m0dmd
00:02  ajpiano: what you should log instead
00:02  ajpiano: is the serialized value of the form
00:02  m0dmd: understood

00:04  juha_: is there any better plugin than this for making floating notes to images: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ImgNotes
00:04  juha_: similar to tagging people in facebook images
00:06  icek: Helppp please, simple accordion problem: www.hathol.com/test/test.php
00:06  Nick_Meister: hi guys ive got a form in my html page but for some reason it wont let me select it using $(#name)
00:07  Nick_Meister: i know it definately has a nambe
00:07  Acorn: Could anyone tell me why these two lines aren't working? http://pastie.org/1293954  (I get "canvas.getContext is not a function")
00:07  kmurph79: is there any easy way to iterate over each checkbox on the page?
00:07  Nick_Meister: and i can select the parent div but nthing else
00:07  ajpiano: draginx, i have a feeling that jquery mobile is like, catching those click events higher up and forcing a class back down
00:07  temp01: Acorn: jquery doesn't return pure dom elements, do canvas.get(0).getContext
00:07  ajpiano: cause the class shows up if oyu pause a debugger in the handler
00:08  temp01: var canvas = $('<canvas/>', {width: cw, height: ch}).appendTo('body');
00:08  temp01: Acorn: ^
00:08  Acorn: temp01: Does that mean I'm going about it a strange way?
00:08  icek: Helppp please, simple accordion problem: www.hathol.com/test/test.php
00:08  temp01: it's fine. use jquery to create the element then just get the dom element and work on it
00:09  Acorn: temp01: okay, cheers :)
00:09  Buttons840: i have a table, and i have used a CSS class and jquery to change the background color of every other table row (this is pretty common i think); but the background color has breaks in it where it transitions from one column to another;  i've tried searching, but it's a difficult to describe problem and i haven't found anything?
00:10  temp01: Buttons840: use #css
00:12  erichynds: Buttons840, what's ur selector look like
00:13 --- c4rl_ is now known as c4rl
00:13  draginx: ajpiano: so what would be a solution :S
00:13  ajpiano: i don't know
00:13  draginx: cause what im doing is such a basic mobile web app thing u know?
00:14  Buttons840: erichynds: i've done $('.stripped tr:even').addClass('highlight');   then use css to change the appearances of the classes
00:14  draginx: i cant even do $9"#grid").hide(); or anything
00:14  draginx: the only command that the jquery mobile can execute there is console.log ;P
00:14  erichynds: Buttons840, do you have cell padding?
00:15  yunosh: what could be reason for jquery mobile to not enhance a page loaded through ajax? if i load that page individually, it's being enhance correctly. if loading through ajax it stops after enhancing the outermost data-role=page div.
00:15  Buttons840: erichynds: i think so; i'm looking at that now
00:16  erichynds: there you have it
00:22 --- c4rl_ is now known as c4rl
00:22  Acorn: Can anyone explain why my attempt at drawing a grid on a canvas isn't working? (it's supposed to be an even grid with a gap of 10px on each side) http://jsfiddle.net/Acorn/Fz24M/4/
00:23  icek: Helppp please, simple accordion problem: www.hathol.com/test/test.php
00:24  Acorn: Fixed on mistake but the grid still isn't even http://jsfiddle.net/Acorn/Fz24M/5/
00:25  Acorn: *one
00:27  danheberden: icek, for one - you have a doc ready call inside a doc ready call
00:27  danheberden: so when the doc ready call runs, it adds a doc ready event
00:27  danheberden: that will never fire
00:28  icek: oh
00:28  icek: lol
00:28 --- kn0wn is now known as known
00:28  danheberden: also, i don't see the class "head" in your markup
00:29  danheberden: which you're referencing in your source
00:29  LCCX: Does someone on have experience using DataTables with ThemeRoller?
00:34 --- snover|away is now known as snover
00:37  draginx: ajpiano: normally I'd agree with ur theory..but there's another problem… http://jsfiddle.net/QgyWj/2/ #grid can't even hide :S
00:49  Nick_Meister: guys i registered a .submit event on a form but when i submit the form the normal action gets executed
00:49  Nick_Meister: what am i doing wrong?
00:49  monkeynut: the normal action will still be executed
00:50  Nick_Meister: yes but i used the $.post
00:50  monkeynut: if you don't specify an action it will not be submitted and your submit function will be instead
00:50  Nick_Meister: to give it a call back function
00:50  monkeynut: ah, you used a $.post?
00:50  Nick_Meister: yes
00:51  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, I think you need to change the submit for a click event on the submit button.
00:51  Nick_Meister: what do you mean?
00:52  monkeynut: is your page re-loading?
00:52  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, no it goes to the page specified in the type attribute
00:52  Nick_Meister: i mean action
00:52  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, you wanted to submit the form when the user clicks on the submit button, so you can do that with a click event
00:52  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, I'm pretty sure I know what's going on, but i think i'll have to see some code to explain
00:53  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, either a live site or code in pastebin would be fine
00:53  PaulB: anyone using boxy here?
00:53  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, Query failure: Table './pastebin/pastebin' is marked as crashed and last (automatic?) repair failed
00:53  Nick_Meister: insert into pastebin (poster, domain, posted, format, code, parent_pid, expires,expiry_flag) values ('Ano
00:53  Nick_Meister: lol
00:54  monkeynut: he he, sql injection
00:54  monkeynut: is your site facing the net?
00:54  Nick_Meister: no
00:54  Nick_Meister: its on my computer
00:54  monkeynut: hmmm, try jsfiddler
00:54  monkeynut: ?ask
00:54  bot-t: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
00:54  danheberden: ?p
00:54  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
00:54  monkeynut: dammit, I thought that gave the fiddler link
00:54  monkeynut: cheers danheberden
00:55  Nick_Meister: http://jsfiddle.net/PX7dr/
00:56  monkeynut: cool, taking a look ;)
00:56  Hutch[S]: hey all. i have a link that instead of following the link, i want to call some jquery. should i use an onClick or a preventdefault in the jquery script?
00:56  danheberden: Nick_Meister: a few quick things, why not jsut use the id? too, instead of attr('value') - use .val()
00:56  danheberden: (its a getter and setter, and works on things like selects 'n textarea's 'n shit)
00:57  monkeynut: yeah, Nick_Meister it's what I thought
00:57  monkeynut: your form is posting the conventional way
00:57  monkeynut: but you are trying to use ajax
00:57  Nick_Meister: so what do i do T.T
00:57  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, what effect do you want to achieve?
00:58  Nick_Meister: send some crap to the server
00:58  Nick_Meister: and get some html back
00:58  danheberden: Nick_Meister: also from a conventions aspect.. naming uname $uname, is a big un-common.. typically you use the dollar sign in a variable to say it's a jquery collection. In the case of getting a value, its simply the data of value
00:58  Nick_Meister: hopefully in xml format
00:58  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, do you want the page to only forward on if username and password are correct?
00:58  danheberden: var $uname = $('#unamel'); var uname = $uname.val();   see what i mean?
00:58  Nick_Meister: no to check that the php script will know
00:59  Nick_Meister: and itll either say nope
00:59  Nick_Meister: or itll say hey look at all this cool data he has
00:59  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, php shouldn't see it as anything other than text
00:59  danheberden: if you're using php, you might want to use json instead of xml
00:59  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, I think there's some stuff you need to learn about how this works
00:59  danheberden: json_encode/json_decode
01:00  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, yes i understand what php will get, but i dont understand why its using the conventional submission
01:00  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, is 'this cool data' page a different page from your server?
01:00  Nick_Meister: no
01:00  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, you have set up a conventional form so it's doing what it's told
01:00  Nick_Meister: its auth.php
01:00  KeeperOfTheSoul: never liked the $ prefix for a jquery collection myself
01:01  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, I suggest you change the type=submit to type=button
01:01  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, that is the simplest way to stop it behaving like a normal form
01:01  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, that should give you more like what you think you are doing with that code
01:02  Nick_Meister: doi register a live event then>
01:02  monkeynut: doesn't matter yet, any events are irrelevant if the page gets reloaded, they'll all be cancelled and ignored
01:02  monkeynut: I'll edit your code on fiddler, gimme a sec
01:04  Nick_Meister: also for some reason it wont let me search for #login
01:04  Nick_Meister: only form.login works for some reason
01:07  mekwall: sooooo...
01:07  ajpiano: coldhead: sorry bro
01:08  coldhead: feels good man
01:08  kmurph79: is there a way to check for the next element on a page from a certain selected element.  like, if i select a checkbox, i want to select the next select box on the page
01:09  monkeynut: http://jsfiddle.net/PX7dr/6/, Nick_Meister
01:09  monkeynut: that will work
01:09  monkeynut: (doesn't run on fiddler because didn't put in jquery script link, I'm presuming that IS in your full page ;)
01:09  mekwall: monkeynut, dont waste too much time in here :)
01:10  monkeynut: mekwall, solving easy problems and helping people is cathartic for me
01:10  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, not even close thats the problem form
01:10  monkeynut: solving tricky problems can be fun and if they're not I can drop them
01:10  Nick_Meister: lol
01:11  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, what do you mean not even close? that will do what you were trying to do. That is how to get the post function to fire instead of just submitting the form. It's what you asked for.
01:11  Nick_Meister: thanks ill try this in a second
01:11  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, i was referring to it being the full page
01:11  monkeynut: ok, sorry, I just saw that after ;)
01:12  mekwall: monkeynut, amen to that... but I also know that you can get addicted to it ;)
01:13  monkeynut: aaah shit, really?
01:13  monkeynut: I might be already!
01:14  monkeynut: actually, will have to turn it down in next week, a LOT of work piling up from excessive 'productive' procrastination
01:14  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, it does not work :(
01:16  mekwall: lol
01:17  Nick_Meister: nvm now it works
01:18  Nick_Meister: for some reason it did not like rollUp method
01:18  Nick_Meister: thanks for the help
01:18  mekwall: Nick, what are you trying to do?
01:18  mekwall: ahhh.... I'm lagging
01:19  monkeynut: np Nick_Meister
01:19 --- squiggy_ is now known as squiggy
01:19  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, it works for me
01:19  monkeynut: Nick_Meister, I just tested it with jquery library, it only fails because the page posting to does not exist
01:20  Nick_Meister: monkeynut, what was failing was the callbacks rollUp function i dont know why, i removed it and it works fine
01:21  monkeynut: fairy nuff, I didn't put it there ;)
01:21  monkeynut: glad you've got what you need now, I was sure that was the problem ...
01:22  monkeynut: danheberden, I also incorported the more traditional naming conventions to the example code, in your honour ;)
01:23  Neiluj: is parseInt() the only way to force-type something like "120%" ?
01:23  monkeynut: doesn't parseInt fail on that?
01:23  nlogax: no
01:24  nlogax: ?eval parseInt("120%")
01:24  bot-t: nlogax: 120
01:24  monkeynut: I see, didn't realise it stripped % for you, i've always done that manually :/
01:24  Neiluj: ?eval ~~(1*"120.5")
01:24  bot-t: Neiluj: 120
01:24  Neiluj: ?eval ~~(1*"120%")
01:24  bot-t: Neiluj: 0
01:24  Neiluj: see?
01:25  Neiluj: ~~ does a floor, 1* does a force-type but only if the string contains a "real" number
01:25  monkeynut: Neiluj, that's not 'force type'
01:25  monkeynut: that's js being weakly typed
01:26  Neiluj: call it whatever you want, you know what I mean ;)
01:26  nlogax: it also converts everything to a signed 32 bit int
01:26  nlogax: have fun chasing bugs :)
01:26  Neiluj: haha
01:26  monkeynut: if it can be converted to an integer then that multiplication becomes meaninful. It also depends on the function context it's being evaluated for (what type it expects)
01:27  Neiluj: so, the answer is no : parseInt is da best?
01:27  nlogax: ?eval [~~2147483647, ~~2147483648] // WHOOPS
01:27  bot-t: nlogax: [2147483647, -2147483648]
01:27  monkeynut: well, ~~ is less characters
01:28  monkeynut: and parseInt is only an advantage if you have % numbers
01:28  Neiluj: ?eval parseInt(101)
01:28  bot-t: Neiluj: 101
01:28  Neiluj: ?eval parseInt("101")
01:28  bot-t: Neiluj: 101
01:28  Neiluj: mmh...
01:28  Neiluj: ?eval parseInt("0101")
01:28  bot-t: Neiluj: 65
01:28  Neiluj: ahaha
01:28  nlogax: ?eval parseInt("0101", 10)
01:28  bot-t: nlogax: 101
01:28  monkeynut: do you understand how parseInt works now?
01:28  Neiluj: ?eval parseInt("0101", 10)
01:28  bot-t: Neiluj: 101
01:28  Neiluj: I know how it works ;)
01:29  Neiluj: I was just searching for a shorter way, seems there's not for "px" or "%"
01:29  monkeynut: I see, parseInt is the most general, if you need it's features go with it, it's not particularly slow.
01:30  Neiluj: yes, it was more for my own curiosity
01:30  Neiluj: than short code
01:30  niels_: what is the best way to get form values as a object mapping? Not serialized or array?
01:30  snover: var p = parseInt;
01:31  monkeynut: Neiluj, short code is very important sometimes. I still have an emergency 28.8k dialup modem ;)
01:32  Neiluj: monkeynut: yeah I know, closure compiler is my best friend but he needs help sometimes
01:32  backinnam: is there a way to bind an event with a string regex match like $('div').bind('^foo.*', function(){ //whatever })
01:32  Neiluj: snover: var parseInt = parseInt inside a function looks better
01:32  backinnam: so any event starging with foo will trigger it
01:32  monkeynut: backinnam, that's not very common, you'd have to roll your own system
01:33  backinnam: bummer...
01:33  monkeynut: backinnam, I presume your app has tonnes of custom events?
01:33  Neiluj: it stays readable for developer but after minification it will be transform to p or whatever,
01:33  monkeynut: backinnam, it sounds like  you may have a design issue, or a very very complex site
01:33  LCCX: Does anyone know how to "enable the flag in the initialisation object" for the jQuery UI DataTables widget?
01:34  monkeynut: LCCX, when you do .dataTables()  you provide options
01:34  Neiluj: backinnam: event's namespaces ?
01:34  snover: Neiluj: you can’t do that…
01:34  backinnam: monkeynut: I am trying to listen for changes on a objects properties.  when the title changes i will fire 'change:title'
01:34  snover: Neiluj: “var parseInt = parseInt;” is “var parseInt; parseInt = parseInt;”
01:35  backinnam: and have one listener that catches it and knows to update the title in the dom based on the title property on the model
01:35  Neiluj: snover: I don't understand
01:35  backinnam: the triggered events will be dynamically generated
01:35  monkeynut: backinnam, just bind an event for object property changes to all of them
01:36  snover: ?g javascript hoisting @ Neiluj
01:36  bot-t: Neiluj, Adequately Good - JavaScript Scoping and Hoisting - http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting
01:36  monkeynut: then inside the event handler $(this) will refer to the one that fired
01:36  backinnam: yeah, i was hoping to not have to create a listener for each property
01:36  monkeynut: it doesn't work like that
01:37  monkeynut: backinnam, it's per object, you'd be able to handle all properties in that one callback
01:38  monkeynut: if you're talking about performance wise because you have tonnes of elements, then use a 'live' binding instead
01:38  Neiluj: snover: sorry but I still don't get it http://jsfiddle.net/aj8QP/
01:38  Neiluj: jslint doesn't yell at me
01:38  backinnam: monkeynut: I guess im not visualizing what you mean properly
01:38  snover: Neiluj: var parseInt = window.parseInt is not the same as var parseInt = parseInt
01:39  monkeynut: backinnam, can you paste example code?
01:39  Neiluj: snover: oh ok, I wrote quickly ;) of course I meant window.parseInt
01:39  backinnam: yeah, one sec
01:41  rmurphey: Neiluj: do the words premature optimization mean anything to you? ;)
01:42  backinnam: monkeynut:  http://jsfiddle.net/vhsJq/1/
01:42  backinnam: the set method is what im dealing wiht
01:42  backinnam: but I want the listener to hear any change events
01:42  Neiluj: rmurphey: hehe of course it does, I wasn't really optimizing but like I said it was more about curiosity
01:44  Neiluj: don't get me wrong : I don't expect to win some ms with a parseInt alternative :D
01:44  monkeynut: cool backinnam, gimme a few mins.  I think you need this event: DOMAttrModified (or similar)
01:45  rmurphey: ok as long as you aren't doing this for the sake of perf
01:45  rmurphey: curiosity is a much better reason
01:46  Neiluj: half curiosity and half < 80 chars lines length ? ;-)
01:46  Neiluj: still reasonable?
01:47  monkeynut: backinnam, that's a big page and you have a broken bracket picked up on line 272
01:49  backinnam: http://jsfiddle.net/vhsJq/2/
01:49  Prometheus: even though the new www.amctheatres.com looks and works like crap, at least it's using jQuery + jQuery UI
01:49  backinnam: monkeynut: woops
01:49  backinnam: thats the new one
01:50  monkeynut: i'm guessing your console.log() didn't fire?
01:50  backinnam: really, the important part is the set method
01:50  monkeynut: http://jsfiddle.net/vhsJq/3/
01:52  monkeynut: backinnam, only problem with that is i'm not sure how cross-browser it is. Some sort of dom update has been in most browsers for long enough, but that particular event is quite recent spec IIRC
01:52 --- ajpi is now known as ajpiano
01:52  monkeynut: so you may have to fiddle more to get it cross-platform. I'm looking to see if there's a jquery normalised version
01:52  backinnam: monkeynut: domAttrModified fires when element in the dom is changed, correct?
01:53  backinnam: i am wanting an event to fire when the model attr is changed
01:53  backinnam: and then update the dom
01:53  monkeynut: backinnam, it fires when one of the attributes (what I read as your description property) changes
01:53  monkeynut: what do you mean by 'model attr' ?
01:54  monkeynut: you mean <a model='blah'>
01:54  monkeynut: if so that should work
01:54  monkeynut: it should react so if you use js to change that element to <a model='other'> the event should fire
01:54  Hutch[S]: is it possible to have an OR on a click function? e.g. $('#backdrop').click() OR $('#modal_close').click() function(){ blah blah?
01:55  monkeynut: Hutch[S], certainly, use ','
01:55  backinnam: monkeynut: sorry for the confusion.  I am using jresig's simple class based inheritance
01:55  monkeynut:  $('#backdrop').click() OR $('#modal_close').click() function(){ blah blah?
01:55  monkeynut:  $('#backdrop,#modal_close').click() function(){ blah blah?
01:55  monkeynut: Hutch[S], ^^
01:55  backinnam: there are models that are stuffed into the dom elements data object
01:56  monkeynut: oh I see!
01:56  backinnam: so the properties that I am changing are on that object
01:56  monkeynut: I *think* that may work
01:56  monkeynut: because the serialised data will still change
01:56  monkeynut: but you will have a more complex handling process
01:56  monkeynut: unless you're saying you've tried and it doesn't fire?
01:57  backinnam: ill try that out, but from what i read, it doesn't work in ie
01:57  backinnam: which is a problem
01:58  backinnam: but I can fire my own custom event, and try to glean the specific into from e.target
01:58  monkeynut: backinnam, but then you're back to binding a tonne of handlers or even better, pass extra data with a single event
01:59  monkeynut: so have one 'mydatachanged' event
01:59  monkeynut: and pass extra parameters to it
01:59  DevX101: i used jquery to update the contents of a select list dynamically, after a first select list is selected.  However, when I try to submit the form (no ajax) it does not detect the changes to the updated form.  What's going on here?
01:59  backinnam: monkeynut: how do you pass extra parameters with an event?
01:59  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: will #modal_close only work for divs? what about if it is an img? ie. <img id="modal_close"
02:00  monkeynut: backinnam, i'll have to look it up because I don't use it, but i've seen it done several times, someone chime in? or I can google it
02:00  rmurphey: ?bind @ backinnam
02:00  bot-t: backinnam, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
02:00  monkeynut: Hutch[S], it works for any kind of tag with an id set
02:00  backinnam: monkeynut: nvm.  i had a case of needing to rtfm
02:00  rmurphey: ?trigger @ backinnam
02:00  bot-t: backinnam, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
02:00  backinnam: its documented
02:00  monkeynut: cheers rmurphey
02:00  backinnam: thanks
02:01  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: hmm, jquery not executing on img click with that tag, but backdrop works
02:01  monkeynut: good luck backinnam looks like you're on your way ;)
02:01  monkeynut: Hutch[S], post code?
02:01  backinnam: monkeynut: thanks a ton, that is that push i needed
02:01  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: oh nvm, the div that the img is in was ajaxed in, i gotta delegate it, grr FML
02:01  monkeynut: Hutch[S], not in here, in jsfiddler or pastebin
02:01  monkeynut: he he
02:01  monkeynut: happy to help backinnam
02:02  monkeynut: I like people like backinnam who are flexible about how to meet their requirements :)
02:02  backinnam: im just happy if it works these days
02:02  backinnam: :P
02:03  monkeynut: backinnam, you'd be surprised how many people are determined to get *their* idea to work by hook or by crook!!
02:04 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
02:05  monkeynut: Hutch[S], just thought, did you consider using 'live' instead of manual event delegation?
02:05  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: couldnt get live to work before
02:06  monkeynut: should be able to, fiddle with it ;)
02:06  monkeynut: Hutch[S], common cause of it not working is some other handler returning false
02:07  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: yea i gave me hell so i just delegate to body now
02:07  monkeynut: Hutch[S], if you're learning, try to get it working. if you've got a deadline, just go with what you know ;)
02:07  Hutch[S]: monkeynut: im learning :D i got a deadline and i don't know much hah
02:08  monkeynut: right, i'm off to bed, good luck everyone! :)
02:08  monkeynut: lol Hutch[S] , I've been there!
02:10  SkullSplitter: hi
02:19  kwaa: At the first refresh, (im refreshing div#window), I get a div#window within my div#window...
02:19  kwaa: http://pastebin.com/isSqVEjz
02:19  kwaa: Any idea why?
02:21  Neiluj: kwaa: not your answer but the "div" in "div#window" is useless
02:23  Neiluj: kwaa: your answer, I supposed you got a div#window inside your index.php response
02:23  Nick_Meister: guys how do i check if a variable contains valid JSON data?
02:23  Neiluj: Nick_Meister: parse it and you'll see ;-)
02:23  kwaa: Neiluj: Yeah, I do.
02:23  Nick_Meister: Neiluj, how do i parse it T.T
02:24  Neiluj: JSON.parse(yourVar)
02:24  Neiluj: ?eval JSON.parse('{"ok":true}')
02:24  bot-t: Neiluj: {"ok": true}
02:24  SkullSplitter: can anyone tell me whats wrong? http://pastebin.com/Sm1S8MDn .. it loads both images but it shows only image 2
02:24  Neiluj: kwaa: so you got your answer?
02:25  kwaa: Neiluj: Nope, I have no idea why it does what it does.
02:25  Neiluj: SkullSplitter: look at your inspector, the other one is probably hidden inside the <ul>
02:25  kwaa: I'll setup a example page.
02:27  SkullSplitter: hmmm
02:28  kwaa: Neiluj: http://imkwaa.com/
02:28  kwaa: It will refresh after 5 seconds.
02:28  kwaa: And you'll see what happens.
02:29  Neiluj: kwaa: :) why are you getting index.html?
02:29  Neiluj: it's an infinite loop
02:30  kwaa: Yeah, just getting .html for an example.
02:30  kwaa: Ok, you know why the entire page copies into div#window, rather than just div#window getting refreshed?
02:31  Neiluj: because you're asking for the entire page?
02:31  Neiluj: :/
02:32  kwaa: Oh, I am? You know how to tweak it?
02:32  Neiluj: $.ajax({type: "GET", url: "/something-else.html",...})
02:33  SkullSplitter: i dont know ...
02:41  anthony_: If i include my jquery code inside of a .js script, should i still have document.ready function inside of that .js include file?

07:59  wookiehangover: jrockjiggz: ya that's fine
08:00  wookiehangover: you can use $(e.target) in this case too
08:00  jrockjiggz: wookiehangover: where?
08:00  jrockjiggz: instead of $(this) you mean,
08:00  wookiehangover: instead of $(this), but they refer to the same element
08:00  wookiehangover: ya
08:01  jrockjiggz: ok, i thought it would refer to $.ajax which is somehow document by default
08:01  Doonce: is there something like .clone that would only make one copy at a time, instead of copying all of them, making an exponential amount of copies
08:02  Doonce: i have a ul that i want to copy and append whenever a link is clicked
08:02  jrockjiggz: .after(  $(this).html() );
08:02 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
08:02  Doonce: instead of clone?

08:07  wookiehangover: or you could just limit your selector $('ul:first').clone().insertAfter('ul:first')
08:11  Doonce: i got it with the first .after example.
08:12  Doonce: but the clone option looks intriguing
08:13 --- denysonique_ is now known as denysonique
08:13  Doonce: yes i like that a lot better
08:16  Doonce: well is there a way to do it where it wouldnt clone values
08:16  Doonce: of inputs
08:16  Doonce: or does that just come with clone
08:17  wookiehangover: you'd have to clear out the values
08:18  Doonce: what i want is.. i have a row of inputs, after they are filled in and they need to add more, i have a button to add another row.
08:18  wookiehangover: $('input').clone().insertAfter('#blah").val("")
08:20  wookiehangover: well you don't even need clone for that
08:20  Doonce: its a lot of inputs.
08:20  Doonce: im copying a ul
08:21  Doonce: i have a ul, want to copy the ul and put it in the form
08:21  wookiehangover: so clone it
08:21  wookiehangover: then clear out the values
08:21  Doonce: yes, thats what im doing
08:21  Doonce: what you said last time didnt work, since im not cloning the inputs directly
08:21  Doonce: im guessing
08:21  wookiehangover: $('.cloned-ul input').val("")
08:22  Doonce: so add a class to
08:22  wookiehangover: you don't *have* to add a class, that's just an example
08:22  wookiehangover: $('input').clone().insertAfter('#blah").find('input').val("")
08:23  Doonce: well that wouldnt work, what i said. ill try that
08:23  Doonce: that worked

08:30  vector_xyz: hi guys
08:30  vector_xyz: any ajax website gurus here :]
08:30  jrockjiggz: hey
08:30  jrockjiggz: i know a bit
08:31  vector_xyz: I wrote an entire web-app in Ajax... works great... it uses alot of custom plugins... so .live() doesnt work always.. so each page loads its own "pagename.js" via getScript that works sweet...
08:31  wookiehangover: that doesn't make any sense
08:31  vector_xyz: my entire web app is in ajax
08:31  vector_xyz: even page loading
08:32  vector_xyz: every single thing .. so what do u propose ?
08:32  wookiehangover: I'm sorry... are you asking a question?
08:32  vector_xyz: anyways...
08:32  jrockjiggz: what is question?
08:32  vector_xyz: if i open page X and go to page Y and go back to page X now in 'console' i see X is doing everything 2x.. if i repeat it keeps adding...
08:32  wookiehangover: or is this like a weird riddle?
08:32  wookiehangover: that's called recursion
08:32  vector_xyz: so after a while it keeps doing things 5x ..
08:32  wookiehangover: and you've got too much of it
08:32  vector_xyz: the question is how do i prevent that
08:32  jrockjiggz: die

08:34  jrockjiggz: vector_xyz: to be safe, i use $('selector').die('click').live('click', function(){});
08:34  vector_xyz: what do u think wookiehangover about jrockjiggz method ?
08:35  vector_xyz: i still think the browser keeps the old .js in its memory and keeps loading a new one
08:35  vector_xyz: should i keep a global array of already loaded files or ?
08:36  wookiehangover: well, you should familiarize yourself with BBQ
08:36  vector_xyz: because my events are not even .live in these .js files so i dont know how it still keeps the old one active the page totally is removed from the dom
08:36  wookiehangover: ? bbq
08:36  bot-t: BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
08:36  vector_xyz: thats what i am using but when i load something the datepickers etc.. are not working
08:36  vector_xyz: so i have to rebind them all
08:36  vector_xyz: and all the slideshows and multiselect by erichynds etc..
08:37  wookiehangover: yeah, it sounds like you've built a fun little rats nest
08:37  wookiehangover: prettymuch, you should structure your "ajax site" in such a way that you know what state you're in and what state you've come from
08:38  wookiehangover: the cs concept of a "state machine"
08:38  wookiehangover: then you can manage your requirements for each state
08:38  wookiehangover: and that will keep you from invoking plugins and dependencies multiple times
08:39  trollboy: with jquery ui, can I nest an accordian inside a dialog?
08:39  wookiehangover: but in general, what jrockjiggz said is correct
08:41  vector_xyz: but what i dont understand is i have an  $("#something").submit(..) its not an live() if i remove the form and re-add it
08:42  vector_xyz: how is it able still to work with this js
08:42  vector_xyz: shouldnt it need a 'rebind' because its not live ?
08:42  wookiehangover: I can't tell you without seeing the code
08:46  wookiehangover: if you have an event bound to an element and you remove it from the DOM and re-add it, you would have to re-bind any events attached to it
08:46  wookiehangover: that's not true if you use clone or detach
08:46  wookiehangover: so I'd have to see the code. patebin that shit, homie
08:57  jrockjiggz: i don't know if this is good practice, but i ended up using .die('submit'),live('submit'...
08:57  jrockjiggz: *.
08:57  wookiehangover: it depends on the context

10:37  ravenzz: var status;
10:37  ravenzz: while (status == undefined) donothing
10:37  ravenzz: :?
10:38  tadejm: You should put an observer on the element and handle the event you want to catch.

10:41  rubydiamond: Need I use jquery UI for small popup / modal dialog
10:42  tadejm: If you want a fancy animation, then yes.
10:47  rubydiamond: tadejm: how is this http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/modal-dialog.htm
10:48  rubydiamond: colorbox vs jquery tools .. which is better ?
10:49  philk__: hmmm can I use QUnit with async requests? Name I have an object that performs an async request and then does an $.event.trigger. Can I wait in my unit test until the event arrives?
10:52  Enselic: If you had a nice website that allows to send messages, and you want automatic testing for that, what framework/method would you use?
10:53  tadejm: rubydiamond: I haven't used any of them yet, so I can't give you a good answer on that one.

11:56  Rappy: I tried it with .css({map}) too. Both seem to fail.
11:58  rubydiamond: jquery ui or facebox ?

12:08  Rappy: Hmm?
12:09  progrock: one sec, i'll psatebin it for you

12:09  progrock: oastebin
12:09  Rappy: Sorry. That's what it was before.
12:09  progrock: yeah,thats better
12:09  Rappy: That still fails.
12:09  progrock: thats what you should be doing
12:10  ravenzz: i've 3 different submit buttons for the same form ...how can i check which one was clicked on submit?
12:10  Rappy: I broke it up into separate .css() because the map was failing.
12:10  philk_: is this the reocmmended way of defensive programming "$.publish && $.publish('DailyProgram/ERROR', [{ 'expert': self.expert }]);" in case the plugin is not available?
12:10  progrock: philk_: check if the plugins object exists, if not it didnt load
12:10  progrock: Rappy: seperate css is bad aidea and slwoer...
12:11  philk_: progrock: thats what $.plugin && $.plugin(..) does, or does it not?
12:11  progrock: Rappy: why are you getting colors liek that.. why dont you add a class istead
12:12  progrock: philk_: if thstas the plugisn objects name, then yes
12:12  progrock: philk_: actually loks like its doing theopsite
12:12  Rappy: progrock - It needs to be dynamic because there are several sites this loads on.
12:12  progrock: "if $.publish then do $.publish('DailyPrograM/ERROR'....
12:13  progrock: Rappy: then the  second code you pasted looks right... are you getting an error, or jsut odd results?
12:13  Rappy: I'd rather do CSS, but I won't know the site's color through CSS.
12:14  philk_: progrock: uhmmm aa && aa() is a shorthand for "if then" isn't it?
12:14  Rappy: progrock - It doesn't do anything and none of the code below it loads. No error in FFs console.
12:15  progrock: philk_: yes thast what I jsut wrote
12:15  progrock: Rappy: and you are doing this after the document is ready?
12:17  Rappy: progrock - No, but the sites CSS loads before the JS does, so that shouldn't matter. I will move it to the bottom of $(document).ready and see what happens.
12:18  progrock: Rappy: as long as its in the document ready you are fine
12:18  progrock: and without the dom, you cant get the css liek you are.. so the documetn needs to be ready
12:20  ravenzz: has the submit event priority
12:20  ravenzz: than the click one?
12:20  Rappy: progrock - I am getting "uncaught exception: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [" showing up in the console, but I can't tell where/what line/what file that is coming from. Is there anyway to find out?
12:21  ravenzz: Rappy try with IE

12:25  ravenzz: swill+allow=swallow lol
12:27  Rappy: progrock - I found the problem and it wasn't the JS I posted. Apparently if a class doesn't exist, you can't use .before('[').after(']') on it.
12:28  Rappy: I had to change it to if ($('.editsection').length) $('.editsection a:last-child').before('[').after(']').text('Edit');
12:29  Rappy: To test if it actually exsists. Then the rest of the code below worked fine.

13:10  ruby_on_tails: hello
13:10  ruby_on_tails: when i close a modal or destroy it why doesnt the actual div get placed back where it was ?
13:10  ruby_on_tails: i see that the div is placed at the end of the html after i close a modal
13:10  ruby_on_tails: why ?
13:10  monkeynut: you're probably appending it to a container
13:11  ruby_on_tails: yes
13:11  ruby_on_tails: no
13:11  ruby_on_tails: i have a div id modal
13:11  monkeynut: ok
13:11  ruby_on_tails: and then $(modal).dialog
13:11  ruby_on_tails: then i close it
13:11  ruby_on_tails: and the actual div goes to the </body> as if it was appended there
13:11  ruby_on_tails: i am using jquery ui default modal
13:11  ruby_on_tails: dialog*
13:12  ruby_on_tails: what i want is that on destroy the actual div to be returned to the place where it was without modifications
13:12  monkeynut: ok, that's just the default behavior then? what did you expect and what do you want?
13:12  ruby_on_tails: how can i get that ?
13:12  monkeynut: I see
13:12  ruby_on_tails:         destroy            Signature:         .dialog( "destroy"        )                Remove the dialog functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state.
13:13  monkeynut: well, it apparently doesn't! which is confusing. I would handle it manually with an even 'ondestroy' or similar
13:13  John_r: hi ppl, can i call this function automatically?  http://pastebin.com/0HLQaVES
13:13  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: can you try closing a modal http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-close ? and see what happens
13:14  monkeynut: John_r, what do you mean by 'automatically'?
13:14  monkeynut: yup, gimme a sec ruby_on_tails
13:14  ruby_on_tails: ok, thanks
13:14  John_r: monkeynut:  when load page
13:14  John_r: when i load my page, open dialog automatically
13:15  nbari: hi, it is posible to have id's in an array format , something like id='mypaginator[title]'
13:15  John_r: monkeynut: Call this function when i load my page
13:15  John_r: http://pastebin.com/0HLQaVES
13:15  monkeynut: John_r, you need to use the onload event ;)
13:15  monkeynut: ?onload
13:15  bot-t: monkeynut, .ready() - Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
13:15  John_r: monkeynut: onLoad event calling function?
13:16  monkeynut: John_r, yes :)
13:16  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails, it closes for me
13:16  ruby_on_tails: oh
13:16  John_r: monkeynut:  i use $(document).ready(function () {
13:16  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails, am I supposed to be looking for it afterwards in firebug? I can click the button and it will pop up again
13:16  John_r: more its not load my dialog
13:16  ruby_on_tails: that wouldnt show the destroy feature
13:17  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: they are closing it not destroying
13:17  monkeynut: ok John_r, gimme a sec i'll look at your code.
13:17  John_r: monkeynut:  thank sir ^^
13:17  ruby_on_tails: though, manual handling would be crazy
13:17  John_r: jqm plugin link: http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/jqModal.js
13:17  monkeynut: only crazy if it works without ;)
13:19  monkeynut: John_r, that should do it http://pastebin.com/QBD2G8Wc
13:20  John_r: monkeynut: humm, when i click here: <a href="#" class="jqModal">view</a> open dialog
13:20  monkeynut: nbari, ids are just strings that are unique in the DOM used to reference things. What are you trying to do I bet there is a better way ;)
13:21  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails, have you got anywhere with it? still not getting/seeing what you need to sort out.  I can only suggest if it's not handling properly to clone it before you modal it and then put the clone back where you want onclose?
13:21  nbari: i am making a paginator and want to add a click event to the title of the rows but wanted to specify the 'sort name' inside the id something like id=sort[name]
13:22  monkeynut: John_r, what do you expect to happen? are you sure you're using the plugin right?
13:22  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: yes i am doing that
13:22  ruby_on_tails: searching a way how to move that html back to square#1
13:22  nbari: wha it am doing not is seting the id like this: id='sort-name', and alter use $('a[id^=pSort-]').click(function(e) split  var sname = $(this).attr('id').split('-'); ....
13:22  John_r: monkeynut: yes... see it
13:23  nbari: I just wanted to avoid the split
13:23  John_r: trigger: '.jqModal',  can i call this trigger automatically when open my page?
13:23  John_r: when i click into .jqModal, i open my dialog
13:23  monkeynut: nbari, I think you should either use classes or a 'name' attribute
13:24  nbari: i think on the 'name' attribut but on HTML5 the  a tag is not suported
13:25  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: i guess a simple append() would move it to square1 ?
13:26  monkeynut: nbari, I think if you post code I could show you what I would do. If you really want array of ids then store each of the id strings in a js array
13:27  monkeynut: ruby_on_tails, that's one way of getting it back in the dom, if you can get it where you want it with that, go for it ;)
13:27  nbari: ok
13:27  monkeynut: John_r, yup you can trigger that. put the trigger function in the $(document).ready(
13:27  ruby_on_tails: monkeynut: ok
13:28  John_r:  $('#dialog').jqm({ .triggerHere )};
13:28  John_r: ?
13:29  John_r:  $('#dialog').jqm({ .triggerHere(); )};
13:30  nbari: http://pastebin.com/vxWEVQ97
13:31  monkeynut: nope, John_r: $(document).ready( function(){ $('#dialog').triggerhere });
13:31  nbari: that is the full code
13:31  monkeynut: John_r, it's not very clear what you're trying to do
13:31  nbari: maybe you can give me some hints on how to improve it
13:31  monkeynut: ok nbari, i'll take a look
13:31  nbari: thanks
13:36  monkeynut: nbari, can you narrow down the bits of code I should look at?
13:37  nbari: sure
13:37  monkeynut: John_r, have you got much further? I'm guessing you're quite new to jquery, what bits about how it works do you find least clear?
13:37  nbari: http://pastebin.com/9xxTCNx5
13:38  monkeynut: nbari, I just meant line numbers, but that'll do ;)
13:38  nbari: oh ok sorry from 112:116
13:39  nbari: also I am trying to find a way of toogle the click so i can add a nice 'arrow' but only on that ID and if user clicks on the other ID remove the arrows from the previous id
13:40  monkeynut: yeah, nbari.  I would have each of those having a pSort class, each id being the unique number
13:41  monkeynut: then your event can be a simple live $('.pSort').live( ... get and handle ids in here
13:42  nbari: with the .live i can start removeing/adding css stuff just for that field and later clicking on other id does changes with the previos ID will be lost right ?
13:43  monkeynut: not sure what you mean, nbari. you should get exactly the effect you were after just a bit cleaner, unless there's more i'm not getting.
13:43  monkeynut: can you explain a bit clearer what you are concerned about?
13:44  nbari: Currently with the code that i have, with every click on a title of the row, each rows append a row (css image)
13:45  monkeynut: ok
13:45  nbari: but I think as you suggested that using the .live('click..... will help to only change/append css to the current id
13:45  nbari: that way only the selected title will have the nice css images/rows
13:48  monkeynut: it looked like you were trying to only get the effect for the particular one that has been clicked on. live will still do the same
13:48  monkeynut: $(this) inside the callback of live will only refer to the one clicked on. I'll edit that code just to check we're on the same page ;)
13:49  nbari: ok thanks
13:50  monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/qu4iPNrr nbari
13:52  nbari: the value sname is the one contains the name of the mysql tables
13:52  nbari: used to later make the query and make somethingl like ORDER by 'sname'
13:52  monkeynut: cool, so does that code give what you were after or is there still a problem?
13:53  nbari: it did
13:53  nbari: but now i just want to improve more the code |o|
13:54  nbari: now insted of replacing the text I would like to tooggle just the text
13:54  nbari: since that way , in every click will just add more text
13:55  monkeynut: ok, have you considered having it there but hidden and then just toggling show/hide?
13:56  nbari: good point
13:57  monkeynut: nbari, ;)
13:58  nbari: I think i will use a toggle and later a toggleClass forthat hidden element for changin  the row image (up/down)
13:58  monkeynut: that's a good plan
13:58  nbari: let me try to doit, thanks for the ideas :)

14:17  ralc: hey, just trying again. I have this droppable and a draggable to drop on it. Is there any way (at pageload), that i can register the draggable with the droppable, so the dropout event will be triggered when the draggable is dragged out?
14:19  arex\: What do you guys think of making a website that requires Javascript support? I.e. it doesn't work properly without Javascript.
14:20  Northwoods: arex\: all dynamic websites that i've made so far will cease without javascript
14:20  Acorn: How would I "translate all coordinates" as this person suggested on SO? http://bit.ly/bTTrer
14:20  Northwoods: Is it possible to replace all options of a select dropdown with ajax call ?
14:21  monkeynut: Northwoods, yup
14:21  arex\: I was previously very concerned about graceful degradation and accessibility, but now I'm developing a "f it" attitude :P
14:21  Acorn: is it a function I'd have to chain onto each context command?
14:21  monkeynut: Northwoods, just write them out, do $('myselect').empty().append( ... )
14:21  arex\: Too much double coding when making autocompletion and other functionality
14:22  monkeynut: Northwoods, all dynamic websites will fail without some scripting language they are written in being enabled!
14:22  monkeynut: arex\, I got an f-it attitude as soon as I got deadlines
14:22  Northwoods: $('myselect').empty().append('<option value="1">first</option><option value="2">second</option>') monkeynut  ?
14:23  monkeynut: rcalc, don't get your problem, can you explain again?
14:24  monkeynut: arex\, you can put <noscript> tags and just have a simple page come up that says 'you must enable javascript to see this page'

15:03  IamTrying: How can i trigger this <input type=file id=attachment />    tried, does nothing: $('#attachment').trigger('click');
15:03  monkeynut: IamTrying, what do you want to do?
15:03  monkeynut: ah, I see, type=file is your problem
15:03  Northwoods: monkeynut: $(this).empty().append("<option value='10'>operator1</option><option value='11'>operator2</option>");  doesn't work , something wrong ?
15:04  monkeynut: IamTrying,  security strictly prohibits javascript activation for file uploads. would work on another input button
15:04  monkeynut: Northwoods, what does $(this) refer to?
15:05  monkeynut: are you sure $(this) is referring to a <select> ?
15:05  Northwoods: monkeynut: :D
15:05  Northwoods: ;p
15:05  IamTrying: monkeynut,  Is this possible? ex: <input type=file id=attachment /> <input type=text id=triggerhidden_file />  , $('#attachment').trigger('click');
15:05  Northwoods: that was issue
15:05  Northwoods: thankyou
15:05  monkeynut: he he, thought so  ;)
15:06  monkeynut: nope IamTrying , that trigger is still associated with file. it would trigger any click event on the type=text if the selector was $('#triggerhidden_file') instead, but that wouldn't get what you want
15:07  monkeynut: IamTrying, if you can find a way to get it to submit the file with pure js (user not clicking themselves) you have found a vulnerability and should report if you can do it!
15:08  monkeynut: IamTrying, if you want to simulate ajax with file, you'll have to use an iframe
15:08  IamTrying: monkeynut,  i want to overlap the browse button with somthing like "bijlage"
15:09  monkeynut: IamTrying, is there a link to your site or some live demo or at least code?

15:12  monkeynut: ravenzz, the problem with multiple submits on a standard form is any of them will submit the whole form, this confuses users
15:12  ravenzz: by default in search mode
15:12  ravenzz: and then i need other 2 button to do other stuffs
15:12  NET||abuse: ok, hmm, not getting this,, ok, i have tried insertAfter  append, appendTo, but i can't add this script tag
15:12  monkeynut: ravenzz, if you want to 'model' a submit button but control each individually and use ajax. just change type=submit to type=button in the inputs and bind click events.
15:13  ravenzz: monkeynut and what about the enter key press?
15:13  monkeynut: koichirose, by y value I assume you mean 'up/down' value? this is $('myelement').height(newheight);
15:13  monkeynut: you can bind a keypress too if you like
15:14  ravenzz: uhm finally i must provide a submit by default?
15:14  ravenzz: or the form could not have submit?
15:14  ravenzz: (sorry for my engl)
15:14  monkeynut: that's okay ravenzz, where you from?
15:15  monkeynut: ravenzz, do you have an example live site to show? or a code sample on jsfiddler?
15:15  ravenzz: italy
15:15  koichirose: monkeynut, no, I mean background position. I have an horizontal sprite image with 5 images on the first row and their hover counterparts below. So I only need to change the y value for the hover to work.
15:15  monkeynut: I can't speak italian at all ravenzz :(
15:15  ravenzz: i can try wait.. im going to try the buttons solution
15:16  ravenzz: np
15:17  koichirose: ravenzz, I'm italian ;)

15:25  monkeynut: koichirose, fair enough, glad you got it working.  I meant that seems like a strange way to achieve hover results, but I don't have the full picture.
15:25 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 88 seconds
15:26  koichirose: yes, I know. The think is that I can't do it with css only, because I'm hovering on the next element. I have something like <li> <span>xxx</span> <span>yyy</span> </li>
15:26  koichirose: an I want to change xxx position while hovering on yyy
15:31  gz0: whats the best way to make variables accessable between javascript files?
15:33  ravenzz: monkeynut http://jsfiddle.net/5bgpF/
15:35  koichirose: ravenzz, what are you trying to do?
15:36  koichirose: .myform > input is not correct there. use .myform input
15:36  ravenzz: mi serve un form con 3 pulsanti.. inserisco un valore nell'inputbox e in base al valore ed al pulsante che clicco dovrei fare robe diverse
15:37  ravenzz: ottimo
15:37  ravenzz: thanks
15:37  koichirose: inizia a cambiare quello. inoltre, mi sa che ci kickano se parliamo in ita :D
15:38  ravenzz: yes lol
15:38  EugenMayer: what is the proper way to get all options of a select element? $('id > option').html() ?
15:39  ravenzz: ok it works
15:39  ravenzz: ty
15:41  IamTrying: monkeynut,  is this the only way to do it to make a jquery plugin. ex: https://gist.github.com/675375
15:42  philk_: I have written a custom selector "DailyProgram:old"  Would it be possible to give the selector a parameter, like the current date?
15:46  monkeynut: EugenMayer, without the .html() you have selected the options, what info do you want to extract from them?
15:46  EugenMayer: monkeynut: its clear to get any attrib / value whatever
15:46  EugenMayer: i just though there is a wrapper for this, lets say
15:46  EugenMayer: $(sel).options()
15:47  monkeynut: ?options
15:47  bot-t: monkeynut, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
15:47  monkeynut: nope.
15:47  monkeynut: I would do a $(yourselector).each(  if you need to handle the values individually somehow
15:49  monkeynut: IamTrying, that input type=file will show up, but yo won't be able to do much with it if it's not in a form, and you can't auto-submit it using ajax
15:50 * EugenMayer is confused
15:50  EugenMayer: ist append inserting after the element selected, not "inside after" ?
15:50  ravenzz: damn works only on IE :\
15:53  philk_: uhmm should one always use $.extend instead of just $.plugin = ?
15:53  ravenzz: bbl
15:54  IamTrying: monkeynut,  i think this is my last chance (i have my plugin for iframe ajax upload, but in ZF i am not trying this) ? ex: https://gist.github.com/675382
15:54  EugenMayer: how to insert a element after some other ( jq 1.2.x )
15:55  EugenMayer: ?after
15:55  bot-t: .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
15:55 * EugenMayer ok
16:04  NET||abuse: how come this is so hard? http://pastebin.com/wpBU8Q2M    Method 3 works, neither of th eother two have worked for me
16:04  NET||abuse: hah, only the last line of each of the methods changes.
16:04  NET||abuse: been playing with that snippet a while.
16:05  NET||abuse: so why don't the jquery append[To] methods work?
16:06  monkeynut: NET||abuse, hang on, i'll take a look
16:06  NET||abuse: ah, forgot , method 2 i did actually try creating the elemnt with $('<script'>, {type:"text/javascript", src:"... etc})
16:08  NET||abuse: so more like it for Method 2,,, http://pastebin.com/8vSZ2kD3    but it actually didn't work.
16:08  monkeynut: http://pastebin.com/ywfSA83g Nek
16:08  monkeynut: NET||abuse, ^^
16:08  NET||abuse: yeh, but stil doesn't work.
16:09  monkeynut: why not? what do you get?
16:09  NET||abuse: no error in firebug or chrome, just the head doesn't have the script element added,,,
16:09  NET||abuse: while it does have a link element for a css file.
16:10  monkeynut: NET||abuse, you don't have to have it in <head>, have you tried appending to <body> ?
16:12  NET||abuse: here's something http://pastebin.com/9QH4Ynjm
16:14  monkeynut: glad you've got a working method.  out of curiosity did you try $('head').append(jpi);
16:15  NET||abuse: monkeynut,  http://pastebin.com/9QH4Ynjm    that's method 1????
16:17  NET||abuse: monkeynut, trying body now also, no joy, still jquery method not working.
16:18  cobexer: there is a bug report for that IIRC

16:25  cobexer: Despe70: you could confirm your speculations by enabling scrippt debugging in IE8 and open the developer tools(F12).
16:25 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 85 seconds
16:25  monkeynut: Despe70, which 'object', xhr is 2nd parameter in callback
16:26  cobexer: Despe70: and it would help if you used the development version when debugging problems
16:26  monkeynut: EugenMayer, decode from what? how was it encoded?
16:27  EugenMayer: monkeynut: i already found it
16:27  monkeynut: ok
16:27  EugenMayer: (difference between .html() and .text()
16:27  NET||abuse: hmm, ok, next issue,, my code doesn't get access to the jsonp method....
16:29  xeen: Are you waiting for it to be loaded NET||abuse?
16:29  xeen: Or just executing after your appendTo()?
16:30  NET||abuse: xeen, hmm, just executing appendTo which is a very good point,, how do i wait till all my plugins i want to load are loaded?
16:30  xeen: I usualy put callback functions on the load event of the script element I create and append
16:31  NET||abuse: using that code i  have working now, how do i include a few plugins, (jsonp, colorbox, maybe one more) and then execute more code.
16:31  xeen: Since script is a blocking load, after the last one is done the previous ones should be.
16:31  NET||abuse: ahh, with script_tag.onload=scriptLoadHanlder and script_tag.onreadystatechange ?
16:32  cobexer: with $(script_tag).bind('load', function(){...});
16:33  xeen: I have a little method that just uses addEventListener when it's avablie NET||abuse, but you already have jQuery loaded, right?
16:33  NET||abuse: xeen, yeh, exactly, this is all actually running in a loadhanlder function for the jquery script tag i included : )
16:33  philk_: how would I select the first element whos attribute value is less than a specfied one
16:34  xeen: IF you already have access to jQuery just use cobexer's example.
16:34  NET||abuse: xeen, yeh, at this point i do,, so ok,
16:34  NET||abuse: xeen, i think i was just confused as jquery's append method wouldn't load the script in the first place.. only a native javascript method worked int he end.
16:35  NET||abuse: can't even append a jquery object ,, the native javascript complains when you pass it the jquery node
16:35  cobexer: NET||abuse: if not you should look up the way jQuery loads scripts in the ajax method, there are some nice comments about memoryleaks and such ;)
16:35  johnf_: how do I force a window to open on top of the clicked window?
16:35  NET||abuse: cobexer, oh? people use the ajax method as a script loader?
16:35  johnf_: My print window always opens behind the calling window/click window
16:36  NET||abuse: ok, taking a break;  afk, thanks for the ideas.
16:36  cobexer: $.getScript but that calls $.ajax internally
16:37  xeen: NET||abuse: you weren't talking about doing element.append($('<some><markup>')); just then were you? because that wouldn't work.
16:37  cobexer: NET||abuse: reading the jQuery code will teach you just how "dangerous" it is to use plain javascript if you care about cross browser compatibility ;)
16:42  johnf_: I'm opening the window like so:window.open('/register/printregistration/','regwindow','width=400,height=400,toolbar=no'); and I want it to be the top windows - how do I do it?
16:42 --- seutje is now known as frigginGone
16:44  Despe70: "interesting" ... it seems that my $.ajax call works correctly when I define my <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" />, but when I replace that by <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> it throws an error about the httpRequest var ...
16:44  Despe70: any ideas ?
16:46  Despe70: I'll give this a try ... http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problems-with-ajax-in-internet-explorer-8
16:46  monkeynut: hello johnf_ :)
16:47  johnf_: monkeynut:  Hey there dude!
16:48  monkeynut: johnf_, have you tried $(window).focus()?
16:48  monkeynut: (that's assuming jquery is loaded in this page you are requesting
16:48  Hopsy: is it possible to block the backspace button in my browser
16:48  johnf_: Nope
16:48  monkeynut: Hopsy, sort of, but not nice!
16:48  johnf_: will try it now
16:48  monkeynut: Hopsy, catch the keypress event, e.preventDefault, return false if key was backspace
16:49  Hopsy: I WAS writeing a text for an hour and pressed accidently at my backspace button :|
16:49  Hopsy: i hate myself
16:49  monkeynut: OH NO!
16:49  monkeynut: I always write long text in an editor and then paste into browser
16:50  Hopsy: thanks for the tip :\
16:50  monkeynut: however, did you know most browsers support ctrl-z on a textarea
16:50  monkeynut: so if you higlight and delete all the text you can ctrl-z it back
16:50  Hopsy: after i go back in history?
16:50  monkeynut: if you've navigated away sometimes it restores the text when you get back ot the page (depends on the page)
16:50  Hopsy: doesnt work for me
16:51  monkeynut: :(
16:51  Hopsy: it was phpmyadmin
16:51  monkeynut: stick to text editor ;)
16:52  monkeynut: johnf_, silly jquery me ... you can just use window.focus();
16:52  Hopsy: bot-t: tell SugaSlide, Hopsy want to smack you!
16:52  bot-t: Hopsy, Okay.
16:52  johnf_: in the calling js or in the window code I'm opening?
16:52  monkeynut: johnf_, you would do this 'onload'. easiest way is to write the following in the body tag for the new page you open:    onload='window.focus();'
16:53  johnf_: cool
16:53  monkeynut: :)
16:53  monkeynut: johnf_, sometimes browsers will block your popup though.
16:54  monkeynut: johnf_, you may prefer using an iframe and requesting the page into that.
16:55  johnf_: Hmmmmm - sounds like it's over my knowledge for the moment
16:56  monkeynut: johnf_, I think you could handle it ;) ... <iframe src='/usl/to/page'></iframe> , then you just have to position it ;)
16:57  monkeynut: but johnf_ go with what works, you may just have to warn users that they should allow popups for your site.
16:58  johnf_: On the net I read that I'm suppose to stay away from iframe?
16:59  johnf_: but after six days who knows what I read?
16:59  monkeynut: johnf_, lots of people say that, usually if there are relevant security concerns. but it's actually a better way to do a lot of things. This could spark a huge argument though ;)  It would be *easy* but not best. best however would involve you doing more coding, and I know you're not in the position to do that at the mo if it can be avoided
17:01  johnf_: you can say that again - I normally learn a programming lang step by step and not the way this is happening at all.  Worse yet it's due one Tuesday
17:02  johnf_: I was totally unfair for him to die - how dare he ;-(
17:02  johnf_: it was
17:02  johnf_: that was a funny
17:03  monkeynut: he he, I know ;)
17:03  Cacheaway: johnf_: i came in late, what are you trying to learn?
17:04  Arimil: anyone know why "$('input[value="pollvote"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html()" is returning null? shouldn't it return the html inside of that node?
17:04  monkeynut: Cacheaway, jquery, javascript, dom, ajax, css and related patterns and techniques ;)
17:04  johnf_: yes the hard way - I have to know it all - and finish a project (the programmer passed - a friend too)
17:05  monkeynut: johnf_, you'll get the hang of it.  Try not to panic too much about the deadline, if I do that I get more confused and work/learn slower
17:05  Cacheaway: johnf_: what is your programming experience?
17:05  RiaGuy: Hey guys
17:06  RiaGuy: Do you know.. it there some JS Framework based on jQuery library?
17:06  Cacheaway: Hey Ria
17:06  monkeynut: Jquery is a js framework really, what are you after?
17:06  johnf_: VFP. python, a little C and C++,
17:06  monkeynut: johnf_, no SQL? :P
17:07  RiaGuy: monkeynut, Dojo, YUI are frameworks, jQuery is just a js library, i don't even have a notion of widgets/modules
17:07  johnf_: Lot's of SQL - in fact way to much
17:07  Cacheaway: johnf_: if you know c / c++ then all you really need to wrap your brain around is closures and anonymous functions, and you have javascript learned
17:07  monkeynut: I see what you mean RiaGuy, drupal works well with jquery
17:07  monkeynut: RiaGuy, so does joomla
17:07  monkeynut: RiaGuy, have you seen jquery.ui ??
17:08  RiaGuy: yep
17:08  RiaGuy: jquery ui is just a set of reusable elements..
17:08  RiaGuy: http://pastebin.com/p6z6cucf
17:08  monkeynut: does ui and associated widgets not count?
17:09  johnf_: First issue so far has been understanding selectors, then the way jquery is being called (don't really have that yet) and then all the html (not to bad) and CSS (that's strange) and then the django stuff (I think I understand most of it)
17:09  monkeynut: RiaGuy, "- A library is something you call/inherit from your code, but framework is something that calls your code or provide services for your code" like drupal and joomla
17:09  johnf_: Oh then the overlap between all of it with jquery
17:10  monkeynut: jquery just covers the client side (browser) actions.
17:11  johnf_: yes - so does CSS, html, and the django can pass data {{something}}
17:11  monkeynut: johnf_, the dom IS your page, jquery is a powerful tool for accessing and manipulating that dom as well as responding to user behavior
17:11  monkeynut: CSS is for formatting
17:11  monkeynut: html is for specifying the structure
17:11  monkeynut: django is your backend
17:11  johnf_: html and the flow
17:12  Dr4g: johnf_, do you have a technical jquery question or just chatting in general? I couldn't figure that out from reading the logs
17:12  monkeynut: django does the server side stuff with python but doesn't do client side stuff (except for javascript it writes into the page it returns)
17:12  monkeynut: Dr4g, I side-tracked into a discussion when he said he was having problems seeing how all the technologies hang together and where jquery sits
17:13  Dr4g: I see.
17:13  johnf_: Oh - so when I return a responses - I'm using jquery (javascript)?
17:13  monkeynut: once the response returns to the browser, jquery/js is taking over
17:14  johnf_: Oh I had not considered that
17:14  johnf_: but it makes sense
17:14  monkeynut: I think that's definitely a key point to realise
17:14  Dr4g: johnf_, maybe you need to read up on the intro to "what is javascript"
17:15  Dr4g: it's client-side code running in your browser.
17:15  johnf_: three days to deliver and my books coming on Monday
17:15  monkeynut: it's funny, he's not got the normal balance of knowledge in this area, it's like he's reached 3rd level in some ways but hasn't walked through the first door in other ways!!
17:16  johnf_: well said
17:16  monkeynut: johnf_, remember the jquery docs are goldmines and the introductory tutorials on there are pretty good. do you want the links again?
17:16  johnf_: No II was re-reading two this morning
17:16  monkeynut: good stuff
17:17  johnf_: One thing I don't like about the doc is they do NOT (normally) include the html in the examples of code - just the actual example does and I have to open the source.
17:18  monkeynut: johnf_, you should use firebug then you will see all their code!
17:18  Arimil: Would anyone mind taking a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/kM9U8/
17:19  monkeynut: Arimil $33,000,000 upfront :P
17:19  monkeynut: what's the problem?
17:19  Arimil: The line starting with "$('form[action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr"]')"
17:19  Arimil: should be grabbing the poll info from the left column and replacing the right column with it
17:19  Arimil: but it's simply removing the right column
17:19  johnf_: Oh - I am doing that - and now see what you mean about using console - at the moment my opinion of the debugger is there is a lot to be wished for
17:20  monkeynut: the debugger is pretty good once you get the hang of it, but I think it's very rare to come across a case where it's better than console.log ;)
17:21  monkeynut: I find the debugger most useful when penetration testing a web-app, and even then rarely
17:21  monkeynut: Arimil, taking a look
17:21  Arimil: monkeynut: thanks
17:22  johnf_: I noticed too that chrome has a debugger and it reports different things than firebug - so I'm using both.
17:22  monkeynut: Arimil, would you like me to clean up some of the code first? I think there's some techniques you should really be aware of. like how to not have 10*.parent() !!
17:23  Arimil: lol sure if you want ;p
17:23 --- nbari|away is now known as nbari
17:23  monkeynut: good work johnf_ , they actually can access the same information, but they have different priorities.
17:25  monkeynut: actually, i'll give you the tips and let you do it.
17:25  monkeynut: ?closest
17:25  bot-t: .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
17:25  monkeynut: instead of multiple .parent. just do .closest('selector').attr( ...
17:26  monkeynut: also, declare a variable for this http://www.xoohq.com/xoo-images/divisions part of the selector, and add it in rather than having it written out each time
17:27  Arimil: Thanks, I'll remember that, however that doesn't solve the problem that I came here for. :p
17:28  Arimil: Granted it isn't optimized but most of it works ^_^
17:28  monkeynut: Arimil, you are replacing that great great ancestor with the input, then next line you are selecting it, going up to that great great ancestor and setting it's html to '' which means remove all it's children.
17:29  monkeynut: Arimil, it's not just optimisation, its about having much cleaner code so you can easily spot problems and change things to meet requirements.
17:29  Arimil: "$('form[action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html($('input[value="pollvote"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html());"
17:30  Arimil: isn't replaceing the right column with .html('');
17:30  Arimil: its grabbing other html and putting it there
17:30  Arimil: in place of what was there
17:30  monkeynut: that's what you told it to do
17:30  monkeynut: the line underneath is the one which removes all the children by setting .html('');
17:31  Arimil: Yes it grabs a node from the left side moves it to the right side and then sets the left side to .html(''); thus removing it from the left side
17:31  monkeynut: I think if you made those two changes I told you about, you would spot the problem right away!
17:31  Arimil: the line before that moves it, the next line deletes it
17:31 --- hackeron_ is now known as hackeron
17:31  monkeynut: Arimil, that's not what it's doing.
17:32  Arimil:   $('form[action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html($('input[value="pollvote"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html()); replaces the html
17:33  Arimil:   $('input[value="pollvote"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().html('');
17:33  Arimil: removes the previous
17:33  Arimil: where is it wrong? I came here for help not to be told it doesn't work :p I already knew that
17:33  bove_: I'm trying to do a case-insensitive id match selection, but can't really understand the suggestions commented in http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
17:34  monkeynut: Arimil, I thought I explained where it is wrong
17:34  Arimil: You said it is being removed before it should be however you never explained where :(
17:35  Arimil: You simply said it's being removed however you didn't tell me where so I can attempt to fix it.
17:35  bove_: I need the selector $("[id*="+searchText+"]").show(); to be case-insensitive
17:35  monkeynut: Arimil, I told you it was that second line you wrote, the one ending in .html('');
17:35  monkeynut: that is the one doing the removing
17:35  monkeynut: It's clearly removing more than you expected
17:36  Arimil: I want the whole right column to disappear, it's not removing anything more than expected, it's just not replacing it with what was expected.
17:37  monkeynut: what is it replacing it with?
17:37  monkeynut: what is different from what you expect?
17:37  Arimil: For example: http://jsfiddle.net/kM9U8/1/
17:37  Arimil: The right column now shows up
17:38  Arimil: I don't want it to be there.
17:38  Arimil: I want the poll from the left column to replace the entier right column.
17:38  monkeynut: $('input[value="pollvote"]').parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent() is what is being put into the element you selected.

17:38  monkeynut: looking at second example
17:39  Arimil: Yes, but the alert that pops up shows the content of pollvote
17:39  Arimil: which isn't being put in the other column like it should be
17:39  Arimil: The other column just ends up empty like if it was null.
17:41  monkeynut: Arimil, I already explained why the other column ends up empty, it's because of .html('')
17:41  Arimil: I want the entire column to be replaced with thus removing the other column.
17:41  Arimil: Oh, wait now I get what you mean
17:41  Arimil: LOL
17:41  monkeynut: :D
17:41  monkeynut: got there :)
17:42  Arimil: Yeah, i'm moving the code corretly but then i'm also removing it when I'm meaning to remove the one from the left column
17:42  Arimil: Thus I'll need to copy the html to a variable :p
17:42  Arimil: thanks
17:44  Arimil: monkeynut: thanks a lot for all your help
17:44  monkeynut: no problem
17:44  monkeynut: honestly, it won't take that long to clean your code, then you will find these things so much quicker to code and problems easier to find! I promise you!
17:44  monkeynut: Arimil, ^^
17:47  pw-toxic: hi
17:47  stefuNz: hi
17:47  pw-toxic: does someone know the jstree plugin?
17:47  pw-toxic: i'm wondering if you can use ajax requests after a drag and drop has been done
17:47  monkeynut: yes
17:47  monkeynut: bind the ondrop event
17:47  monkeynut: then put your ajax request in the handler
17:47  pw-toxic: the "drop_finish" function of jstree only works when i drop something on an element outside of the tree
17:48  pw-toxic: how do i bind the ondrop event?
17:48  pw-toxic: http://www.jstree.com/documentation/dnd
17:48  pw-toxic: there is a "drop_finish" option with a function callback, but it only works for the external jstree-drop class
17:49  monkeynut: pw-toxic, so what are you dragging and where is it being dropped?
17:50  pw-toxic: monkeynut, im dragging "Root node 2" onto "Root node1" and the element gets moved, but no alert window opens
17:51  pw-toxic: now "Root node 2" is inside of "Root node 1" but no function callback was called
17:51  pw-toxic: but i need to call a function so i can update my database
17:52  monkeynut: is Root node 1 a drop target?
17:52  monkeynut: hang on, just seen link
17:52  monkeynut: i'll check that first
17:52  pw-toxic: monkeynut, o dont understand your question ;(
17:53  monkeynut: sorry, thought that was link to your code
17:54  monkeynut: pw-toxic, where have you put your alert() ? in which event handler and what is that handler bound to?
17:54  pw-toxic: monkeynut, i have done nothing.. i'm only talking of the example on the examples page
17:55  pw-toxic: if i drop a node onto the external big div item where i can drop something
17:55  pw-toxic: i get an alert
17:55  pw-toxic: but i want this alert to happen when i drop an tree element item onto an tree element item
17:58  pw-toxic: monkeynut, any idea?
17:59  monkeynut: that's interesting pw-toxic I'm not getting any alert boxes firing from their example page either. either page or plugin is broken or they haven't really put the alerts in
17:59 --- nbari is now known as nbari|away
18:01  pw-toxic: monkeynut, damnit.. im building a databased navigation and i need some events fired to update the database ;(
18:01  monkeynut: pw-toxic, there is another way
18:01  pw-toxic: so tell me ;)
18:02  monkeynut: you could define them as draggable using jquery.ui and then have your handler use that dragStop event
18:02  pw-toxic: monkeynut, haha I have found a much easier solution
18:02  monkeynut: go for it?
18:02  pw-toxic: monkeynut, just add "class="js-dropable" in the li element
18:02  pw-toxic: ;)
18:02  pw-toxic: and the alert appears
18:02  monkeynut: excellent, can you report that as a bug to the plugin dev?
18:03  pw-toxic: "jstree-drop" i mean
18:03  pw-toxic: im not sure if this is a bug
18:03  monkeynut: it should have been put there by the plugin.
18:03  pw-toxic: ok
18:03  pw-toxic: where can i report it?
18:03  pw-toxic: ah
18:03  pw-toxic: google
18:06  pw-toxic: monkeynut,reported it
18:08  monkeynut: good work pw-toxic
