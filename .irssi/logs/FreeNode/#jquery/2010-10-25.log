00:00  JKarsrud: Vorspire: Not even close when it comes to Js
00:00  Vorspire: for html, xml and JS
00:00  Vorspire: it's quite proficient
00:00  JKarsrud: I use VS2010 for all serverside stuff on .NET, but when it comes to HTML, CSS, XML, JS it sucks compared to webIDE
00:01  Vorspire: autocomplete and format document is all i need
00:02  Vorspire: tbh I didn't know about WebIDE before you said it, so I'll give it a look :)
00:02  JKarsrud_: Sorry, had to reboot my router, it sucked :P
00:02  JKarsrud_: Vorspire: I suppose you know about Jetbrains, coming from .NET and all?
00:02  nelsaidi: I'm using notepad ++ :P
00:02  nelsaidi: coded a hell of a lot of PHP And used to it, I've got aptana installed and see its benefits just find it akward
00:02  Vorspire: no, I haven't heard of Jetbrains tbh
00:03  JKarsrud_: nelsaidi: It works for simple stuff, but when you want to do a lot of JS, it doesn't cut it
00:03  icekk:  can anyone tell me why this callback function is being called before the animation is complete? jQuery(".vid_block").stop().animate({ width: '56px', height: '51px'}, 400,  function() { alert('animation complete'); });  just hover over the pagepeel and exit the hover to see it happen www.hathol.com/test/index.php
00:03  JKarsrud_: Not having any code sense, indexing of files etc
00:03  nelsaidi: yep
00:03  JKarsrud_: Vorspire: Never heard of Resharper?
00:03  Vorspire: Yea I've got that
00:04  JKarsrud_: Jetbrains makes resharper ;)
00:04  Vorspire: or at least I did have
00:04  Vorspire: ahh :D
00:04  Vorspire: I tried PHP Designer too, but the IDE needs work
00:04 * jrockjiggz has been looking for a good IDE
00:04  Vorspire: never been able to finda decent PHP IDE
00:05  jrockjiggz: was about to switch to netbeans
00:05  JKarsrud_: Ahh, excellent. The reboot of the router worked like I hoped it would! Back to 24/24 mbps, instead of 2/2 :P
00:05  nelsaidi: All the PHP I've done tbh has been of my own framework or no framework so it doesnt get too complicated
00:05  Vorspire: rofl
00:05  JKarsrud_: jrockjiggz: check out phpstorm or webstorm :)
00:05  boxod: Using a jquery swipe gesture on my iPhone site, but when using this on an iPhone 4 it is slow and not as smooth. Any suggestions?
00:05 --- JKarsrud_ is now known as JKarsrud
00:05  jrockjiggz: JKarsrud: webstorm
00:05  nelsaidi: Aptana's SVN,the auto complete, auto sense, etc- all works good
00:05  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: Well, that's because it runs on eclipse
00:06  nelsaidi: yep, but whats wrong with eclipse?
00:06  JKarsrud: WebIDE runs on IDEA, that's used in IntelliJ, RubyMine etc etc
00:06  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: It's slow as hell
00:06  JKarsrud: And I find IDEA to be a much better written piece of java software than eclipse
00:07  nelsaidi: loading for me takes ~20 seconds but from there on its fast
00:07  nelsaidi: Also - Can anyone recomend a good horizontal accordion? I've got one on my site but it works pretty awfully?
00:07  nelsaidi: I'm trying to fix it up though
00:07  JKarsrud: Plus the refactoring possibilities you have in WebIDE is so much better than those of aptana
00:07  JKarsrud: Which one are you using now?
00:07  Vorspire: is there any good PHP IDE?
00:08  JKarsrud: Vorspire: PHPStorm? :)
00:08  b0x: netbeans is ok
00:08  b0x: aptana
00:08  Vorspire: It's not buggy is it?
00:08  JKarsrud: Vorspire: If you download the EAP, it's pretty stable
00:08  Vorspire: ok, thanks for that info :)
00:08  JKarsrud: Weekly builds etc, so they're pretty stable
00:09  JKarsrud: Plus if there are a lot of complaints and bugreports, they're quick to release new builds :)
00:09  snover: Komodo Edit is great with PHP but it is not an IDE. Komodo IDE is an IDE but it is not free.
00:09  snover: Also
00:09  snover: This is not ##php
00:09  nelsaidi: heh
00:09  JKarsrud: snover: I know
00:09  JKarsrud: :)
00:10  boxod: Does anyone use jquery for iPhone sites that may be able to help?
00:10  snover: Do you, JKarsrud? DO YOU?
00:10  JKarsrud: I do.
00:10  snover: very well.
00:10  JKarsrud: I wasn't the one who started talking about PHP in here in the first place, I just suggested a great JS IDE :)
00:11  JKarsrud: nelsaidi: Which accordion plugin are you using now, btw?
00:11  icekk: this is driving me insane, why the heck is my animate callback being called before its even finished animating? www.hathol.com/test/index.php  http://www.hathol.com/test/javascript/jquery.animation.js
00:12  nelsaidi: none, it was a snippet extracted from the first google result for jquery horrizontal accordion
00:12  JKarsrud: aha
00:12  nelsaidi: its pretty simple, and i understand how it works so thats cool
00:12  nelsaidi: but its too simple to be usable
00:12  JKarsrud: You could check out the jQuery UI accordion
00:12  nelsaidi: sorting out other aspects before i attempt touching it up
00:12  JKarsrud: ?jqueryui accordion
00:12  bot-t: JKarsrud, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
00:12  nelsaidi: Its vertical
00:13  boxod: Can anyone help with some iPhone jquery?
00:13  ajpiano: icekk: you're not passing the callback properly
00:13  ajpiano: you need to pass a reference to the function, not execute the function
00:13  icekk: ?
00:13  ajpiano: icekk:  jQuery(".msg_block").stop().animate({ width: '49px', height: '44px' }, 590, shrink );
00:13  ajpiano: not
00:13  ajpiano: jQuery(".msg_block").stop().animate({ width: '49px', height: '44px' }, 590, shrink() );
00:14  icekk: ajpiano har har har thank you that fixed it
00:15  Vorspire: bah, still need a strong regex to detect groups of ./ and ../ - all the times i've tried have failed by grouping the entire file path
00:16  NET||abuse: ok, so been reading up on creating cross site widgets, one of the things people are saying is don't use a framework?
00:17  boxod: www.guywoodier.co.uk/test can someone tell me why this is less smooth on an iPhone 4 than on a 3gs
00:17  NET||abuse: Does anyone here have any experience with 3rd party site widgets
00:20  Hierofant: I hate when I can't reproduce the client side error!  Debugging is a pain done thru chat with a layman
00:20  Hierofant: I have a bug in Safari for Mac and possibly one version of IE, on some machines, some days.
00:21  fkr680: hello everyone
00:21  fkr680: if i do var audio = $('<audio>'); can i later call audio.play() ?
00:22  fkr680: and if so, how? (the code above doesn't work)
00:22  ajpiano: try audio[0]
00:22  ajpiano: .play()
00:22  ajpiano: otherwise it's wrapped in a jquery obj
00:23  etcetera: anyone tried the new asp.net mvc 3 jquery validation stuff?
00:23  TrentHauck: hi
00:24  serio_: Who uses .net?
00:24  serio_: I mean, really
00:24  fkr680: ajpiano: hmm, i'm guessing it worked (it didn't throw an exception this time)
00:24  Jonz: I met a guy who uses .net once
00:24  fkr680: ajpiano: it worked!
00:25  fkr680: ajpiano: thanks!
00:25  fkr680: bye
00:25  Jonz: I think a lot of gov't contractors/subcontractors use it, there's this lingering perception in the gov't space that microsoft products are more secure/supported
00:26  etcetera: probably not the answer to the question I was looking for...
00:26  serio_: I know a lot of companies use it.
00:26  etcetera: I mean, really.
00:26  Hierofant: Hey all.  Is this valid code?  if (top.location.href !== "http://bgmezibov.com/client/index.php") { top.location.href = "http://bgmezibov.com/client/index.php"; };
00:26  serio_: etcetera, I was just kidding.
00:26  kronus: hello! I'm having a bit of a strange issue - I am storing the results of a selector in an array, and having trouble applying addClass to it. However, I can do the exact JS on the command line, and it will work, which is why I'm stuck on what's wrong...
00:27  serio_: kronus, you're using document.ready?
00:27  kronus: serio_: yes
00:28  serio_: can we see some code, or perhaps a live example?
00:28  Pymous: Helloooooo !
00:28  kronus: potentially. let me get it uploaded.
00:28  serio_: brb
00:29  Pymous: How i can select every <li> from a ul with a certain class ? (like <ul class="myul"><li>Test</li><li>Test2</li></ul>)
00:31  jonthomas83: I have a variable 'year' (e.g. 1999) I need to iterate through the options in a select list, find the one option that matches the text() to the variable, then I need to put the "value" of that option into another variable, anybody have any ideas how I'd do this and how I'd mark it up? Many thanks
00:31  kronus: serio_: http://dyakovlev.info/connect4
00:32  serio_: Pymouse $( 'ul.myul li' )
00:32 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:33  Pymous: serio_ > I have find something else => $("ul.myul > li"), works like a charm
00:33  Pymous: But thanks anyway ;)
00:33  serio_: kronus, where's the array in question?
00:34  kronus: game.DOM.columns
00:34  kronus: I'm caching a few selectors in order to not have to continually re-execute them
00:35  serio_: yeah
00:36  serio_: so, game.initBoard() is what kicks off everything in the connect4.js?
00:36  kronus: no, game.init() does that
00:37  kronus: but the html is calling the same thing init() calls, individually for now (for debuggin')
00:37  serio_: where's game.init() being called?
00:37  serio_: perhpas that should be in your document.ready function as well.
00:37  kronus: it currently isn't. the doc.ready code calls the various init bits directly
00:38  serio_: but, there's nothing being called in connect4.js that involves jQuery other than what's inside document.ready?
00:39  kronus: yes, the part i'm having issue with - stuff in buildBoardListeners
00:39  serio_: k, you can't access js before document.ready
00:40  serio_: I would guess that the connect4 js is trying to call jQuery stuff before it's ready
00:40  serio_: this.init() gets called as soon as the connect4.js is loaded?
00:40  kronus: even if none of of the connect4 stuff is initialized before document.ready?
00:40  kronus: no, it shouldn't
00:41  kronus: as far as I understand JS, none of that code is executed until I make a new Connect4 in document.ready
00:41  serio_: I don't see how it would be an issue, because you're only creating the Connect4 object on domready
00:41  serio_: yeah
00:41  kronus: yup, that's where I am currently stuck :/
00:42 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
00:42  serio_: so it's the buildBoardListeners() function that
00:43  serio_: is giving your grief?
00:43  kronus: ooooh wait I think I may have figured it out
00:43  kronus: this is a scope problem - the functions I pass to hover are not aware of this.DOM
00:43  serio_: ah
00:43  kronus: probably. testing it out
00:44  serio_: you'll need to reference the Connect4 object then
00:44  kronus: yeah... I'm wondering how to do this.  is it possible without the whole var that=this mess?
00:45  serio_: not sure.
00:45  kronus: hrrm. no dice, referring to it via game or window.game doesn't do it
00:46  serio_: my guess is that you're right about it being a scope issue,
00:46  serio_: depending on how and when items are being called, 'this' probablly isn't referencing what you think it is.
00:46  Pymous: Excuse me (again), i have a little issue, when i do this: $(".sub_content").css("width", 295);
00:47  kronus: hah, yeah. in the event handler callbacks, 'this' is actually the td element
00:47  Pymous: It's simply... doesn't work !
00:47  IceGuest_75: Can someone tell me how to run a script while holding the mouse click on an element?
00:47  serio_: Pymouse, your syntax is wrong
00:47  Pymous: Oh ?
00:47  pifantastic: "295px"
00:47  serio_: $(".sub_content").css( { "width" : "295px" } );
00:47  pifantastic: oh, that too
00:48  serio_: try that.
00:48  pifantastic: serio: css("prop", "val") should work too
00:48  Pymous: Doesn't work either :(
00:48  pifantastic: Pymous: are you waiting for $(document).ready ?
00:48  pifantastic: ?p @ Pymous
00:48  Pymous: Yep pifantastic
00:49  bot-t: Pymous, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
00:49  serio_: yes, it should also work
00:49  serio_: I just checked the css docs to make sure.
00:49  IceGuest_75: anyone?
00:49  kronus: serio_: got it to work by accessing it vai the external handle. I don't like this fix...
00:50  pifantastic: IceGuest_75: I dont understand your question.  What do you mean "holding the mouse click on an element"?
00:50  IceGuest_75: I want an event
00:50  pifantastic: $("#foo").click(function() { /* do stuff here */ });
00:51  IceGuest_75: holding the mouse click on an element
00:51  Pymous: pifantastic > Here u are: http://jsfiddle.net/Pymous/CQKPu/1/
00:51  IceGuest_75: pifantastic, I do not want one click
00:52  IceGuest_75: is to hold a click on an element
00:53  pifantastic: Pymous: the width attribute is overriding the CSS
00:53  Pymous: I don't understand, if i do .css("background", "red"); it's work !
00:53  Pymous: pifantastic > I don't understand, so i can't change it ?
00:53  pifantastic: Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/HHvBB/
00:54  Pymous: Oh !
00:54  Pymous: Get it !
00:54  Pymous: Thank u ! :)
00:54  serio_: lol, you were specifying width in the tag
00:54  pifantastic: IceGuest_75: You mean, when the user clicks, you dont want them to be able to move the mouse until some script finishes executing?
00:54  icekk: What is the proper syntax for setting the display property from jquery? jQuery("#slides").display("inline");
00:54  serio_: css
00:55  icekk: nah its jquery
00:55  serio_: jQuery("#slides").css( { 'display' : 'inline' } );
00:55  pifantastic: IceGuest_75: Because user's are the ones that get to control when they click and release the mouse, im afraid that is not something you can do with javascript
00:55  serio_: use the css method, I mean :)
00:55  Hierofant: dang.  hate it when the url broadcasts the session id
00:56  IceGuest_75: no, I want the script to run when the mouse button is hit on an element
00:56  pifantastic: icekk: jQuery("#slides").hide() or jQuery("#slides").css("display", "none");
00:56  pifantastic: IceGuest_75: Use the click event: http://api.jquery.com/click/
00:56  icekk: thanks
00:56  Pymous: pifantastic > Sorry to bother u again, but it's still not working :( (i've removed the width attribute in the HTML)
00:57  IceGuest_75: not click!
00:57  pifantastic: IceGuest_75: http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/
00:57  pifantastic: Pymous: in jsfiddle?
00:57  pifantastic: because your original link was not loading jQuery
00:57  jonthomas83: I'm trying to iterate through options in a select list to get the value into a variable, can anyone tell me where my syntax is going wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/tbQ7x/5/ many thanks
00:58  pifantastic: jonthomas83: use .val()
00:58  Pymous: pifantastic > No, in my own code :(
00:58  IceGuest_75: while I hold the mouse button pressed over an element
00:58  IceGuest_75: this is what I want

01:05  icekk: After I execute a line of jquery is there a way to just wait for a specified amount of time before executing the next line?
01:06  Krinkle: Hi, I've got two jQuery objects in two variables $t_links and $p_links, and would like to have them in 1 object and then do a $all_links.each(). Currently I have two exact same eaches() which seems a bit unhandy.
01:06  icekk: pifantastic?

01:07  Pymous: pifantastic > The EXACT same without the width in the HTML
01:07  Krinkle: pifantastic: It's kind of impossible to pastebin it.
01:07  Krinkle: $data_later = $data.find('pages > page[title="' + wgWhatLeavesHereTarget + '"]').find('cl, el, im');
01:07  Krinkle: $data = $data.find('pages > page[title="' + wgWhatLeavesHereTarget + '"]').find('tl, pl');
01:07  Krinkle: $data = $data.add($data_bottom);
01:08  Krinkle: I need to each() over "tl, pl" first anad then over "cl, em, im"
01:08  Krinkle: in the live code I have $data_later.each() and $data.each() but I prefer to add them together and do only 1 each()
01:08  Krinkle: but $data = $data.add($data_bottom); causes soms cl's to be between "tl" and "pl"
01:09  Krinkle: (the source is XML, hence the weird element tag names)
01:09  Krinkle: I would like to add $data_later after $data in the array.

01:32  pifantastic: Not completely,  but the TDs have to fill up the width of that TR

01:33  pifantastic: and they werent adding up to 700

02:36  beeradb: hey all… I was hoping someone might point me towards the documentation I need… I've got a bunch of li's.. each li has a single select form option in it, I'm allowing those li's to be sorted using jquery.ui.sortable…. I've got sortable calling my own custom function on drop, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to update those selects to be in the right order.. i.e. the first select should get the value 0, the second 1, and so forth
02:36  beeradb: striking out on what to search google for :)

03:42  fourcolors: is there a way to reload an element with jquery? such as text field so my placeholder reshows after I do an ajax request for a comment
03:42  macmartine: thanks guys, i'll try
03:43  l4rk: fourcolors: in the ajax success callback you could reset the placeholder
03:43  l4rk: are you using a plugin or something?
03:43  fourcolors: l4rk: yes, I'm using javascript to make sure I have the html5 placeholder tag
03:44  l4rk: k placeholder is an attribute not a tag
03:44  l4rk: probably just need to reset the value
03:44  l4rk: $("path to input[type=text]").val("")?
03:44  fourcolors: ooh so I don't use .css to change it ?
03:44  l4rk: not if you're using a plugin... i'd assume that'd handle everything for you
03:45  fourcolors: l4rk: but when I click on the box the text still shows up, it doesn't disapear like with a placeholder
03:45  l4rk: what text
03:45  l4rk: the placeholder text?
03:45  fourcolors: yes
03:45  l4rk: what plugin are you using?
03:45  fourcolors: let me try the attr() command first one sec
03:46  l4rk: http://github.com/miketaylr/jQuery-html5-placeholder should emulate it just fine
03:50  fourcolors: l4rk: ok im going to give that plugin a go, I  had a different one
03:51  paul_socal: hey guys, in my regex match how can i match hyphens and periods as well?
03:52  fourcolors: l4rk: i'm confused on how to use that plugin, do I need to call a function to make sure it's working in my dom or something?
03:53  fourcolors: l4rk: the last plugin I was using I just called the function while in my dom and it worked
03:53  coldhead: escape them, paul_socal \. and \-
03:56  l4rk: fourcolors: you call the placeholder function as described in the readme on that page i linked you to
03:56  fourcolors: l4rk: oh I see so I have to call the placeholder() call on every element that uses the placeholder attribute?
03:57  l4rk: yea but the first example does that for you
03:58  fourcolors: l4rk: ooh whats with this part? $('input[placeholder]').placeholder({ color: '#bada55' }); I guess that just changes the color or something eh?
03:58  l4rk: guessing its just a css() object
03:58  l4rk: so anything you'd use in css() could be assigned there
04:05  NoPyGod: curr = $('#edit-pmsg span').html();
04:05  NoPyGod: returns
04:05  NoPyGod: bla bla&lt;"
04:05  NoPyGod: why does it not escape the "
04:06  NoPyGod: the most important thing for it to escape is the "
04:06  NoPyGod: but it does not do it
04:08  l4rk: NoPyGod: it maps to innerHTML
04:09  NoPyGod: what is the correct way to get escaped text
04:09  NoPyGod: i need to make " and > into their safe html special characters
04:09  l4rk: i suppose you could use the escape function
04:09  NoPyGod: isnt the escape function for urls
04:09  NoPyGod: ie %20 instead of space
04:09  l4rk: hey you said escape not me
04:10  l4rk: i think you want html entities
04:10  NoPyGod: yes
04:10  NoPyGod: that is what i want
04:10  NoPyGod: please tell me where im going wrong
04:10  l4rk: i'm not entirely sure how to do that outside of regex
04:11  NoPyGod: but it's so essential to basic ajax stuff
04:11  aaroninfidel: sorry, I might be overly thinking this but how could I overide the functionality of an anchor tag and add a slide effect to it? http://lifeiscontent.net/lc4/  click on item 1 and item 2 to see what I am talking about.
04:11  NoPyGod: how could it not be part of jquery, i just dont understand it
04:11  l4rk: uh if you are using ajax you'd want to escape it like i just said
04:11  NoPyGod: using the escape function?
04:11  NoPyGod: here's what im doing
04:11  l4rk: yes and you said it wasn't what you wanted
04:12  NoPyGod: user profile page has a "personal message" span
04:12  NoPyGod: when u click the span, it turns into a textbox
04:12  NoPyGod: and u can edit the personal message from there
04:12  NoPyGod: so my problem is arising when i copy the value of the span into the textbox
04:12  NoPyGod: see here - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/280109/

04:13  NoPyGod: in the code i showed you, you can see how the text is being copied into the new input
04:13  NoPyGod: and since the " is not escaped, it results in the input's text field being broken out of
04:14  l4rk: why are you using text(...) to set and html() to get?
04:14  l4rk: instead of using text() in both places
04:14  NoPyGod: ive been fiddling aroud trying to get it to work
04:14  NoPyGod: doesnt matter what combination i use
04:14  NoPyGod: i always have problems
04:15  NoPyGod: the problem is not with the reset function
04:15  NoPyGod: but with the html that is created in the edit function
04:16  l4rk: just need to add slashes then
04:17  NoPyGod: no
04:17  NoPyGod: ah man
04:17  NoPyGod: this is ridiculous
04:17  NoPyGod: ive spent hours on this, fucking jquery
04:17  NoPyGod: wheres the special_chars function
04:17  l4rk: well adding slashes works fine here and its totally not jquery's fault
04:19  l4rk: jQuery("<input/>").val('"'.replace(/"/g, '\"')).val()
04:19  l4rk: returns "
04:20  NoPyGod: having to manually replace characters is frickin crazy
04:20  NoPyGod: whats the point in having a framework
04:20  NoPyGod: this isnt a big ask from a framework
04:20  l4rk: its a library and yeah i know programming is crazy
04:21  l4rk: i mean holy shit i have to use a replace function thats built into every single javascript implementation

04:42  someguy00: Hi, I'm loading an xml file with "?"+Math.random() appended to the filename to prevent caching every 15 seconds with the jquery ajax function. After a while the system returns "low on virtual memory" error which is understandable... How would I destroy the data variable/loaded file after Im done with it?
04:43  snover: someguy00: jquery already does that.
04:43  Jonz: in javascript, you can do "delete varName";
04:43  someguy00: but in Chrome I can watch all the xml files loaded
04:43  snover: someguy00: there is no reason you should need to ever handle deleting the data yourself unless your code is totally fucked
04:43  someguy00: hmm ill try the delete varname
04:43  Jonz: but I second snover's assessment that your code is fucked
04:43  Jonz: jk, jk
04:43  snover: and delete varname isn’t going to solve your problem if the data is not being gc’d because you have a closure or other reference to it stored somewhere else
04:45  someguy00: delete doesnt really do anything
04:45  someguy00: its not the variable i need to remove
04:45  someguy00: its the loaded xml file i need to unload
04:46  someguy00: http://api.jquery.com/unload/ ?
04:47  Jonz: someguy00, if you really need to update data every 15 seconds, you might consider looking into making a persistent connection, in Apache you can do this with so_keepalive
04:49  Jonz: but the quickfix is probably what snover told you, find the place where you're storing the data in a closure that's causing the data to not get garbage collected and fix that
04:49  snover: Jonz: keepalive is handled below the js level
04:49  someguy00: its a unix thing? i think my client uses windows iis
04:49  snover: it’s not really the same thing as a persistent connection
04:50  snover: it’s held open, but only for a few seconds to avoid the cost of tcp buildup/teardown on every request
04:50  Jonz: ah, i haven't used it myself, just thought I understood the principle
04:51  someguy00: hmm did i understand this properly: instead of just $.ajax({ i need to use something like lala = $.ajax({
04:52  someguy00: http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/
04:52  someguy00: hmm
04:52  someguy00: oh nonono
04:52  someguy00: i am using setTimeout and i should be using lala = setTimeout?
04:53  someguy00: var lala*
04:53  Jonz: someguy00 you could probably get more help if you paste a link to code
04:54  someguy00: :/ let me check something and if it doesnt work ill paste
04:57  someguy00: http://jsfiddle.net/tnPe6/
04:57  someguy00: i just added the cleartimeout thing so that shouldnt be there i think
04:57  someguy00: http://jsfiddle.net/tnPe6/3/
04:58  someguy00: how do i destroy the xml file after its been stored in the window.INV.dataXML variable?

06:15  fourcolors: it worked before I did an ajax request to delete the comment

06:16  coldhead: Adman65: did you try the jquery UI autocomplete?
06:16  Adman65: coldhead: I am using my own bastardized hack to get that to work. Was wondering if anyone had written a dedicated solution
06:16  someguy00: theMadness: what kind of slider? you can use jQuery Tools for a slideshow but im not sure if it can rotate divs
06:16  fourcolors: Adman65: oh I think thats it, because I have a delete request but when i view source I can't see the authenticity token
06:17  fourcolors: Adman65: Ok cool, I'm generating the link in a helper method so I think that might be whats messing it up
06:17  Adman65: fourcolors: make sure you have the correct stuff in the header that adds a form authenticty token into the tom
06:17  Adman65: i don't remember the helper but it's there
06:17  Adman65: (it will affect all PUT/DELTE/POST) r
06:18  fourcolors: Adman65: I believe what your talking about is this ...   <%= csrf_meta_tag %> ... however it's located in my application file just fine and creating a comment with ajax works great

07:54  Cork: codemonkey701: jquery normally don't really care about its original position, so if you want to keep that information, you need to save it your self
07:54  codemonkey701: Cork: thanks. but  is there a way to get that the position of the element say the 3rd one down returns a value of 3?
07:54  arifbandali: I have a form that is using the validator plugin to make sure at least one radio button is selected. Works well. However, once that first form validates and is then submitted, some js reloads the form (with different items as radio button items) and on this iteration the validator does not work.
07:54  arifbandali: I'm sure I'm missing something fairly simple - any idea? Thanks in advance.
07:54  codemonkey701: Cork: then i can save that info to the data
07:56  Cork: codemonkey701: no not that it know it by it self. but you can do $('ul li').each(function(index) { $(this).data('original', index); });

08:11  fourcolors: I have the watermark plugin included in my project and then in my header am calling this script in my dom http://pastie.org/1246592
08:12  chovy: temp01: says permission denied now.
08:12  fourcolors: is this how to add html5 support for placeholders ??
08:12  fourcolors: or is there a better way
08:12  temp01: chovy: you can't do that if it's not from same domain
08:13  chovy: bummer
08:14  Superman_: getting disabled control's value is same as we get the normal control's value???

08:19  temp01: Superman_: stop with multipe ??
08:19  temp01: multiple
08:20  Superman_: multiple?
08:20  coldhead: maybe his ? key is busted???
08:23  chovy: temp01: can't be a subdomain either apparently.
08:24  chovy: like cdn.example.com/script.js can't access an iframe on example.com
08:24  temp01: you can do subdomain if you set document.domain

08:43  mogilny: visiblity:hidden is better ;)
08:43  mekwall: depends on the usage
08:44  mekwall: it's not better or worse
08:44  aaroninfidel: is there a way I can get the offset of a child element inside in comparison to the parent element?
08:44  mogilny: for fadding is better
08:44  mogilny: shifting layout doesn't work for fading
08:44  mekwall: not if you the element you are fading should be hidden :P

08:58  aaroninfidel: Hi, if I have a parent element with a class of .body and a child element with an ID of #test-1 how could I find the offset between the 2? rather then the offset of #test-1 and the body element?
08:58  aaroninfidel: window*
09:06  mogilny: aaroninfidel
09:06  mogilny: get the offset of both and subtract
