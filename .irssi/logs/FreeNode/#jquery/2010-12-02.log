16:28  DAElectric: ajpiano: only been here 5 mins and have allready had to direct someone to your site that pm'd me
16:28  felixjet: if i have 2 functions, like... var foo = { s1: function(){}, s2: function(){} };
16:28  ajpiano: DAElectric i made that site cause like, after 3 yrs in this channel....had a lot of repeat customers
16:28  ajpiano: if you know what i mean
16:29  felixjet: and s2 does: s2: function() { this.s1(whatever); }
16:29  ajpiano: oh wait
16:29  felixjet: why doesnt work?
16:29  felixjet: it works with foo.s1(whatever);
16:29  felixjet: but why "this" doesnt reference the scope?
16:29  ajpiano: felixjet, what are you attaching the s1 function to
16:29  ajpiano: an element using bind??
16:29  felixjet: no, just calling it
16:30  felixjet: s1: function(bla) { alert(bla); }
16:30  felixjet: s2: funciton() { this.s1('aaaa'); }
16:30  felixjet: it doesnt work

16:35  danheberden: DAElectric: isn't there, like, css examples galore on teh interwebs?
16:36  Vorspire: $('img.example').width() returns 0 all the time, I know this is because the call is made in a doc.ready callback and the image hasn't "loaded" yet, however attaching a $.load handler to the img element and "blocking the current stack" until all images are loaded still does not work, any ideas why?

16:52  crab: ok, i have a form in which i have n sets of three fields (each set in its own div) and an "add another three fields" button. would it be better (on button click) to clone the last element and set the input values to "", or to keep a display:none div at the end of the form and clone that and display one clone?

16:53  crab: or is this one of things where i should just think "blah, whatever works" and move on?

16:53  sean`: compaq, in my head
16:53  compaq: sean`, alert is just for testing
16:53  sean`: compaq, don't use alert
16:53  granden: sean`: That would be really neat. But Im not that good with jquery javascript just modifying a gallery script. So sorry but I really would need help on implementeing it
16:53  sean`: granden, you'll have to do it yourself, we'll help yo uwith some stuff
16:53  mathi: temp01, if I use $('#typeOfMessage').val('dummy'); the behaviour isn't the same. seems that the first option is selected

16:55  compaq: shauntain_mobile, are seriously saying javascript can not assign variables
16:55  shauntain_mobile: compaq: json is not switching languages, it's used for templating... if you want to do an associated lookup like that then it is the best way
16:56  compaq: sean`, doesn't work, I tested foo is still baz

17:05  danheberden: .attr("disabled", true) btw
17:05  ajpiano: danheberden, nuh uh
17:05  ajpiano: afaik
17:06  danheberden: you're the one that convinced me otherwise
17:06  ajpiano: you use disabled disabled, checked checked, etc.
17:06  ajpiano: did i?
17:06  danheberden: ajpiano: nope
17:06  ajpiano: that doesn't sound like something i'd do
17:06  danheberden: DOM is different than markup
17:06  danheberden: the DOM node is true/false
17:06  temp01: attr() sets property, it doesn't really matter. "disabled" is truthy too
17:06  danheberden: true
17:06  ajpiano: thy
17:06  danheberden: temp01, YOU are truthy
17:06  temp01: Nno u
17:06  temp01: -N
17:06 * danheberden blushes
17:07  danheberden: but, like, if you check the disabled property of a dom node
17:07  danheberden: it isn't "disabled"
17:07  danheberden: it's a boolean
17:08  ajpiano: i knows
17:08  temp01: he knows
17:08  danheberden: ajpiano: do you know what a dom node is?
17:08  danheberden: cuz i has a jquery
17:08  ajpiano: NODE I DON'T
17:08  danheberden: and i needs to use it on a dom nodes
17:08  danheberden: i keep trying my selectors
17:08  danheberden: but they don't work
17:09  danheberden: $("SELECT `val` FROM `input` WHERE `name` = 'username'");

17:11  Brodingo: lol
17:11  Hory: thx
17:11  danheberden: 99.9% of the people need to use SQL
17:11  Ryro: where can i get that?

17:11  danheberden: BOOM DONE
17:11  squeeks: ooh, it appears people have tried to do SPARQL and jQuery.
17:12  Ryro: except for the fact that it will expose your db to any kind of sql injection
17:12  ajpiano: lexer, parser, throw er out of bed
17:12  Dracos_: lol
17:12  danheberden: Ryro: you can trust your users
17:12  danheberden: like they would every do anything malicious
17:12  Ryro: oh.. ok
17:12  Ryro: good point
17:12  l4rk: what? I'm talking about using sql on the dom
17:12  l4rk: not a database
17:12  l4rk: there is literally no security issue there
17:13  danheberden: hahahaha
17:13  Ryro: you're right css is more verbose than it needs to be
17:13  Ryro: SQL is much more concise
17:13  squeeks: But I use a NoSQL datastore because SQL is so old, you can't SQL inject me!

17:16  ajpiano: ugh
17:16  ajpiano: i just got back to the doctor, i had selections that were lasting over 400ms
17:16  Dracos_: what about your mom's inputs?
17:16  danheberden: lawls
17:18  crab: if i am using the jquery form plugin and have $('form.someclass').ajaxForm({...}), how can i convert that to a delegation such that new DOM elements of that class also become ajax forms?
17:19  ajpiano: crab $(".foo").live("submit",function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).ajaxSubmit(options);  });
17:19  ajpiano: crab: $.fn.ajaxForm is jsut a light wrapper around the $.fn.ajaxSubmit method which does all the actual work
17:19  felixjet: it is possible to remove a script tag from dom?
17:19  felixjet: after its been executed
17:19  temp01: you won't get name of submit buttons thoug
17:20  temp01: h

17:25  monk12: hello all, is there an easy way to check if a radio button is changed ... like i want to use $(this) or something like that instead of retyping the selector in my if statements:  http://jsfiddle.net/8VDum/
17:26  TheSin: morning all, got a quick question.  I'm having a hell of a time making my site more iphone/ipad compatible, right now if they click on an anchor it created a perm hover event, using jquery can I cancel or stop the hover on click?
17:26  monk12: something like a  $(this).get(':checked') ... i want to get the value of the checked radio button using 'this' in the event.
17:26  ajpiano: ?checkboxes @ monk12
17:26  bot-t: monk12, To set a checkbox to checked, do .attr("checked","checked"). To uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked"). To check if it's checked or not: .is(":checked");
17:27  monk12: ajpiano, in the case of a radio button, how would  you get the current value that is checked... i could check all the radio buttons, but i want just the one that is checked.
17:28  ajpiano: monk12, the best approach is not to select at all, but filter the existing set, i'll show you
17:28  roger_padactor: plupload looses the session one uploading a file how do ppl work around this?

17:31  monk12: thanks!
17:33  monk12: I like how you assigned the variable to the inputs and re-used it.
17:33  enRaged: WHat would be the best way to query a database every X minutes to see if a datetime column > current time and if so do a popup (havascript or some other way)
17:34  Ryro: set interval to fire off an ajax call
17:34  enRaged: ok
17:34  enRaged: how do i make it popup though?
17:35  Dracos_: you mean an old school evil window.open()?
17:35  enRaged: i would prefer something more stylish...
17:35  Dracos_: ui.dialog, jqmodal, there are lots of ways
17:36  Brodingo: i think he meant a recursive settimeout
17:36  DAElectric: is there a way to set which check is the default for checked so that when you call resetform the correct one will be checked
17:38  enRaged: can i just have it so a <div> that is set to display:none changes so it is displayed if date time column > current time?
17:40  Ryro: brodingo: i always mix up the 2 you're right recursive settimeout is the way to go
17:42  tapmodo: regarding recursive settimeout, is that better than setinterval? I would've thought it was the other way around... any info on this?
17:42  Ryro: http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/ its a few minutes in but he does a good job explaining it

18:03  kasad: i guess i am making mistake somewhere with not referencing iframe properly
18:03  boobo: .attr('checked', (json.some_field == 0) ? false : true) ..did I use with no problems

18:05  Unode: hi everyone
18:05  Unode: is there any alternative to ":gt()" using a function instead of building a string?
18:05  ajpiano: Unode, use .slice
18:06 --- cgreninger is now known as creativecag
18:06 --- mfer-phone is now known as mfer
18:06  Unode: ajpiano, slice uses 1 index instead of 0 index like :gt() right?
18:07  ajpiano: nope
18:07  ajpiano: slice is 0 too
18:07  ajpiano: the only thing that uses a 1 based index is child-based selectors
18:07  ajpiano: :nth-child(1)
18:07  ajpiano: cause it doesn't make sense for a child to be the 0th child of its parent
18:07  boobo: http://wijmo.com/
18:08  Unode: ajpiano, hum ... .filter(":gt(1)") gives me the same as .slice(2)
18:08  aro: i have a problem: i have 5 checkboxes, and when the last one gets deselected, it pops an alert window that says at least one checkbox must be selected - and it then selects the checkbox(es) - however when it does the reselect (using $.each().trigger("click"); ) it gets an endless loop of alerts
18:08  aro: how do i avoid that?
18:09  ajpiano: Unode: what do you want, exactly
18:09  kasad: hm
18:10  Unode: ajpiano, the slice function gives me what I want, I was just pointing out that :gt(index) == .slice(index+1)
18:10  kasad: can .append work to inject something into iframe or is there something like .insertInto, similar to .insertBefore

18:17  erichynds: kasad are u trying to work inside an iframe from the parent page?
18:17  erichynds: if so, you need to use contents() to get inside of the thing, assuming it's on the same domain
18:18  kasad: iframe is pointing to login page of whole system
18:18  kasad: and everything is functional from the browser
18:18  kasad: but one of tards at the company insisted that they have the "client" for using the system
18:18  Backie: Hey guys, how would I select an input item using the name field as the identifier. (If that makes any sense)

18:19  kasad: so i figured just to get her off my back i'd make simple air app that just has an iframe which points to login page
18:20  kasad: i can't my fiance works for company that was their consultant for years :P
18:20  kasad: fiancee*
18:20  erichynds: not sure how the whole AIR thing works tbh
18:20  kasad: so what i'm trying to do is to add back, forward, reload and close buttons on top of whole thing
18:21  kasad: but obviously only for those who are using the client
18:21  erichynds: inside the iframe?
18:21  erichynds: or outside of it?
18:21  kasad: it's currently outside, whole iframe is login page of the system
18:21  kasad: or well dashboard if you log in
18:22  erichynds: yeah
18:22  erichynds: i imagine you'll run into cross origin issues there
18:22  ajpiano: erichynds: function live() { breathe(in,function() { breathe(out,live);} }
18:22  kasad: it can be inside if it can be injected from parent document
18:22  kasad: yeah i already had nightmare with sandbox
18:22  erichynds: setInterval(live, 10)
18:23  kasad: but everything works fine now, even added nice tray icon which can pop notifications if you get a message or so (didn't made any notification, as matter of fact atm i have one it says EAT COCK :P )
18:23  ajpiano: erichynds, nah bro, it recurses
18:24  erichynds: oh yeah
18:24  kasad: it re curses
18:24  kasad: and curses

18:31  MaxMeents: need some ideas on why url="http://www.visoogle.com/"  is valid but not url="http://www.visoogle.com/_ajax/Movies/883/1999/Fight Club-1999-MPAA-R.html"  I'm adding twitter buttons dynamically next to all my movies
18:31  kasad: why i accepted this shit is beyond me
18:31  MaxMeents: if I type paste that second url in the top of my browser, it will go to that page and redirect back to visoogle becasue thats what that page is supposed to do but any ideas why it isn't a valid url if I can visit it through my browser?
18:32  sohail: MaxMeents: you need to escape the url
18:32  sohail: and btw, you made fight club? dude I loved that movie
18:32  sveajobb: MaxMeents, might be because of the space between fight and club. it should be %20 I think?
18:32  manveru: is there some event i can bind to when the id portion of the uri changes?
18:32  MaxMeents: so the browser does this automatically?
18:32  Jonz: manveru, what is the id portion of the uri?
18:33  sohail: MaxMeents: yes, use the js escape() function
18:33  sveajobb: MaxMeents, mine does atleast :)
18:33  manveru: Jonz: foo.bar/#someid
18:33  MaxMeents: man, I'm very hopfeful right now
18:33  Jonz: ah
18:33  Jonz: manveru, we call that anchor or hash
18:33  manveru: oh, thanks
18:33  Jonz: manveru, check out jquery bbq
18:33  manveru: that's nicer for google :)
18:34  kasad: i need some hash right now
18:34  manveru: so it's the hashchange event
18:35  kasad: yes
18:35  kasad: google for it
18:35  manveru: Jonz: thanks for bbq, but that's way too much for what i need :)
18:35  manveru: kasad: that's what googling told me ;)
18:36  manveru: how else do you think i found it?
18:36  kasad: i meant google for plugin, didn't figured you found it

18:40  kasad: like once in a zillion years i actually need air for something
18:41  kojiro: you think that's air you're coding?
18:41  kasad: and i expected to be done in like 30 minutes tops

18:52  kasad: ok i officially hate adobe air
18:52  kasad: so, i'm gonna go for gay solution
18:52  sohail: MaxMeents: I just put escape around the second URL =
18:52  kasad: which just springed to my mind
18:52  MaxMeents: can you show me?
18:53  aro: i have a problem: i have 5 checkboxes, and when the last one gets deselected, it pops an alert window that says at least one checkbox must be selected - and it then selects the checkbox(es) - however when it does the reselect (using $.each().trigger("click"); ) it gets an endless loop of alerts
18:53  kasad: instead of messing with air "client"
18:53  aro: how do i avoid that?
18:53  anxiolytic: I have an img within an <a> tag. I want to grab the alt of the img.. all I have is $(this) (the <a> tag)
18:53  anxiolytic: what to do ??
18:53  kasad: i will include on every page, if webkit then display stupid back/forward/reload/close buttons
18:53  aro: anxiolytic: $(this).find("img").attr("alt");
18:54  aro: or next()
18:54  aro: in lieu of find()
18:54  aro: actually i think it is juist find()
18:54  anxiolytic: aro: thanks
18:54  kasad: find(money)
18:54  kasad: doesn't work, still broke
18:55  MaxMeents: sohail? what do you mean you put it around the second one? I used URL = escape(URL) and it failed with both urls
18:58  sohail: MaxMeents: worked for me
18:58  sohail: what browser
18:58  toby--: is it possible only refresh a function if the content in a php file changes?
18:58  MaxMeents: firefox
18:58  MaxMeents: your clicking the second one right?

18:59  MaxMeents: what are u using, I want to try
18:59  sohail: oh yes, I do get invalid
18:59  sohail: invalid url
18:59  sohail: but that's from twitter so you have to ask twitter how they want the urls to be encoded
19:00  MaxMeents: hmm... right, but they have nothing about that on the support forums from what I can find, how would you do a search for this information, I mean what is this called that I'm trying to find
19:02  MaxMeents: OMG
19:02  MaxMeents: THANK YOU
19:02  MaxMeents: sohail, twitter url encoding
19:02  MaxMeents: lol, it works now
19:03  MaxMeents: twitter wants a freaking + instead of space, thats it
19:03  aro: i could have told you that :P

19:10  danktamagachi: I have a form that has no default submit function because I validate the input with jquery before it is submitted.  After the validation, I submit the form to a php mailer file I made via a JQuery AJAX call.  However, when javascript is disabled, the form doesn't do anything!  Is it best practice to have the form work anyways?  Or should I provide alternate contact info for people without JS?
19:10  erichynds: make it submit and add server side validation
19:13  danktamagachi: erichynds: should I then change my JQuery code to remove the default submit action and instead validate client side first?  My server side script does validate, the client side stuff is just to avoid a refresh if they don't enter a return email address or somethign
19:13  erichynds: danktamagachi, use jquery to intercept the submit and ajax to the action in the form
19:14  danktamagachi: sounds good!

19:16  freedgy: Hey all, I'm sliding some divs with background images with animate() on css 'left'. Works fine. I've added some tool tip style popups in each div, using hide() on them - when you mouse over each I'm using fadeTo() to show them. Works Fine. Problem is, when sliding the animation those hidden divs leave artifacts on the divs, like you can see a rectangle of artifacts while sliding. Any ideas?

19:34 * cohitre sighs
19:34  Trisox: might need to use htmlspecialchars
19:34  Trisox: then
19:35  Trisox: cohitre something wrong?
19:35  Trisox: if its valid its no problem
19:35  cohitre: wysiwyg editors are generally a pain to interact with.
19:37  cohitre: i would say that rendering HTML is not a job for JSON and you should consider making an ajax call that only returns the HTML
19:37  ajpiano: i wouldn't say that
19:38  ajpiano: i've delivered html inside of a json bfeore

20:19  swiggy: i just dont understand.. how id use .live() with http://jsfiddle.net/Pze29/ since my .change() event is in $(docuement).ready
20:19  swiggy: what do i put in .live('change', //here)
20:19  erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/Pze29/1/
20:19  Ryro: function(){}
20:19  swiggy: what do i put in .live('change', function(){ //here })
20:19  swiggy: i know
20:19  swiggy: but what goes inside it..
20:19  erichynds: the same shit you have
20:19  swiggy: i dont have a 'function'
20:19  swiggy: .. ugh
20:20  swiggy: i hate duplicate code
20:20  erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/Pze29/1/ swiggy

20:20  Tomashe: hey guys
20:20  swiggy: o
20:20  hariom: erichynds: I have used serialize and I get parameter string. Is it possible to convert this string into Json?
20:20  Ryro: he doesnt need live for this though
20:20  Tomashe: there is a way to man min script regular script
20:20  dtelepathy: .bind('function', function(){});
20:20  swiggy: .live() will work with current object too?
20:20  dtelepathy: .bind('event', function(){});*
20:21  erichynds: hariom, no, but you can use the script @ json.org
20:21  erichynds: hariom, but if it's a form submission, you don't need json
20:21  swiggy:  $('select[name*="itemtab"]').live('change', function(){   alert($(this).val());  });
20:21  swiggy: is that correct??
20:21  swiggy: its not fuckn working
20:21  swiggy: not firing at all
20:21  dtelepathy: Do any mods have access to the plugin directory?
20:21  erichynds: swiggy
20:22  Ryro: swiggy: are you using a debugger
20:22  Tomashe: guys ? can i take colorbox.min and make it a readable version?

20:22  swiggy: yes

20:23  Tomashe: i got some .min script

20:23  erichynds: hariom, use this to make JSON ?see stringify
20:23  swiggy: wtf is wrong

20:23  bot-t: hariom, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (http://json.org/json2.js) to provide a fallback. jQuery does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
20:24  dtelepathy: Eddie
20:24  Tomashe: someting that dont have source
20:24  swiggy: the jsbin script isnt 100% accurate
20:24  erichynds: swiggy, wtf does a console.log of ur selector show you
20:24  swiggy: my html is being dynamically created
20:24  swiggy: how do i log it
20:24  erichynds: we know
20:24  Tomashe: custome script that friend made but i cannt reach him anymore and i have the min only
20:24  swiggy: its not made yet
20:24  swiggy: console.log only fires on dom ready
20:24  swiggy: not each time
20:24  erichynds: it goes into the DOM at some point
20:24  eTiger13: Tomashe:  then look for an unpacker
20:25  eTiger13: swiggy: console.log it after it is created
20:25  swiggy: console.log($('select')) ?
20:25  erichynds: it's probably not firing because it's probably not matching anything

20:34  swiggy: but in firebug its there
20:34  swiggy: ..
20:34  swiggy: wtf
20:34  erichynds: ur god damn selector is wrong then
20:34  erichynds: give them a common class and be done with it
20:34  eTiger13: swiggy: you have nothing named itemtab nor is anything being created with that name
20:34  eTiger13: thats why your selector fails
20:35  swiggy: name="tab1itemtype1"        selector->   [name*="itemtype"]
20:35  swiggy: right?!
20:35  eTiger13: i see this: $('select[name*="itemtab"]')

20:46  hariom: erichynds: Should I use json2.js instead of jquery-json?
20:47  ajpiano: hariom: yes
20:47  ajpiano: you should always provide JSON2.js, it mocks the native object and falls back if it exists

20:57  ajpiano: true
20:57  eTiger13: seanbrant: oh maybe i was thinking of sortable
20:57  seanbrant: eTiger13: yeah, the prob is the overflow auto hides that element when you drag it outside the container
20:57  Putr: eTiger13: ye but would it be a big NONO if i used both? (i have a script that uses get to filter users, and i whant to use it to send emails, but because of get size limitations i wanna send the email text with post)

21:31  ServerSage: Hey folks, I think I may have found an odd bug with jqGrid, but I'd like verification I'm not whacked in the head.  I have thrown together a small sample page that demonstrates the problem in FF, Safari, and Chrome (I don't have IE to test).  Here is the link:  https://www.emolhealth.com/test.htm
21:33  totels: all together: $('li > a[href*="'+ window.location.pathname +'"]').parent()
21:34  wellthere: is it possible that to have a select, select from 2 different types of elements (in my case, an <input> & <select>) but suppling a containing modifier for name?? I was thinking something like          $('input|select[name*="whatever"]')  ?

21:37  richardr: PaulB_: or attr("id") ?
21:37  danktamagachi: does anyone know of a good resource where I can learn more about queue() and dequeue()? the API is pretty lacking in explanation
21:38  richardr: I've dynamically created some HTML after a successful AJAX request. However, when I click the dynamically created HTML buttons - which I've defined triggers for it doesn't work

21:39  Ryro: you need to bind the event to the button after it is created or use something like live or delegate
21:39  eTiger13: danktamagachi: how so? seems pretty straight forward. add to a queue or remove from it
21:39  richardr: Ryro: how do I bind after the button is created?
21:40  Ryro: after you insert the html into the dom, $('#button_id').click(function(){//what do you want to do});
21:40  eTiger13: richardr: in the callback
21:40  danktamagachi: eTiger13: I'm just looking for a more indepth explanation.  I'm nto sure on what dequeue does, also, I don't know how to implement them properly.  You can see how I did it at www.davenadel.com , but I'm not sure this is correct.  I wanted to wait until the first DIV hid before I showed the "loading" div
21:40  richardr: Ryro: that's already there. How do I bind it after my successful AJAX request?
21:41  Ryro: in the success:function(){} of your ajax call
21:42  DAElectric: eTiger13: ok it is buttonset() not button() when using a set of radios

21:44  danktamagachi: eTiger13: so how can i ensure the div is hidden before the load() method is called
21:44  freedgy: Hey all, wondering if you can restrict a jquery ui draggable object to only positive or negative values.. i.e only want an item to be dragged on the positive X. Thanks!
21:45  freedgy: Docs seems to only state restriction is based on axis, not which side of the axis
21:45  dmpeters63: hey - so I want to load data using ajax that currently is hidden using the .hide - when some one clicks on the element to .show the data - I want it to load then - any suggestions on what jquery function I should use?
21:45  eTiger13: danktamagachi: chain it. $(div).hide().load(stuff)
21:46  ajpiano: freedgy: wouldn't that mean that if you slide something to the right, and then you slide it too far, you can't slide it back to the left at all
21:46  danktamagachi: eTiger13: that's what I wanted to do!  But the hide() method is in an if block so I can't chain anything to the end of it.  If I didn't put the hide() in an if block, it would momentarily show the div and re-hide it if it was already hidden.  so i need the hide() in the if block and the load() outside of it
21:46  ajpiano: freedgy, in any event, ithat's not available in dragable by default
21:46  voodootikigod: ben_alman: Here what's up
21:47  eTiger13: danktamagachi: huh?
21:47  elb0w: when I pop up a dialog how do I make it the same size as the content im passing it?
21:48  aro: how do i access jquery plugin member functions?
21:48  freedgy: Yes, exactly. Making an image carousel you can click / drag, and use back / next buttons. Also making it have a circular option. When circular is disabled, and you come to the end of the image set, I want to disable dragging to the right. Similar if you're at the beginning I don't want you to drag left.. only right.. any ideas?

21:49  danktamagachi: eTiger- I have a DIV that may or may not be hidden at a given time.  I have a function that hides the div, shows a loading div, loads new content into the div, and then hides the loading message and shows the div with new content.  However, I need to have the first hide() method in an IF block because if it fires on an element that is already hidden, it re-shows it for a split second before runnning the hide animation.  So, I ne
21:49  danktamagachi: chaining them
21:49  compaq: I have a bunch of img element with with a common class and unique id's, but some of them are missing src images, Anyone know how to select and delete them?
21:49  danktamagachi: eTiger13: you can see what I mean in the source of www.davenadel.com
21:50  compaq: danktamagachi, wierd, cause I call hide on hiden and it doesn't show them
21:50  freedgy: oops, ajpiano, that last post was for you
21:50  danktamagachi: compaq: even if hide() has an animation attached?
21:50  eTiger13: danktamagachi:  it shouldnt show it
21:50  compaq: danktamagachi, yep, I use hide(1200)
21:51  ajpiano: freedgy, i would basically say you could give a SHOT to using the drag events and trying to cancel if you track some sort of negative delta
21:51  ajpiano: but you're basically on your own
21:51  compaq: danktamagachi, I have about five hidden and one showing, and if I call show on anyone of them, I first call hide on the rest
21:53  eTiger13: danktamagachi: http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/8unsP/
21:53  freedgy: ajpiano: yea I dont see anything in the docs.. you're totally right. Not quite sure how to acheive this. the drag: event fires once dragging has begun.. and the start: event is prior.. so I can't tell which direction it's going... even if I try to pad it out with distance() before dragging that keeps it all disabled, so I can even check during the initial drag.. :(
21:54  ajpiano: freedgy, you'd have to check during like, a few events and log to see what was even happening
21:54  ajpiano: like, log the current x position
21:54  ajpiano: and see if it's going downward
21:54  freedgy: Which means, if I do it in drag: the element is dragged a little before I can disable it. I just want to disable all -x movement..
21:54  Ryro: freedgy: here is an example $('#draggable2').bind('drag', function(event, ui){ if(ui.position.left > 200){ $(this).trigger('mouseup'); }});
21:54  danktamagachi: eTiger13: your blue DIV doesn't show up for me at all in that example
21:54  Ryro: it stops dragging at 200
21:55  eTiger13: danktamagachi: exactly. and it doesnt show if hide is called on it when it is hidden
21:55  freedgy: Ryro: thats exactly how I'm determining which way to fire the carousel (you drag 25px on the X and the carousel fires left, or -25px and it goes right... but I want to disable any -X before the dragging has ever begun
21:56  Articate: I have this form that has functions on .change and .keypress and such. but there's some php going on first that might enable the
21:56  Articate: a checkbox*
21:56  danktamagachi: eTiger13: check this one out though http://jsfiddle.net/8unsP/4/ the blue flashes for a second before it hides!
21:56  Articate: ..no, wait.. I figured it out :)
21:56  Ryro: do that in the start method, put an if and if you're past where you want to go, trigger a mouse up so it never starts maybe?
21:56  Ryro: *start event
21:57  freedgy: that mouseup might be helpful.. hmm.. ok thanks for the thoughts gents
21:57  eTiger13: danktamagachi: what browser?
21:57  eTiger13: ?hide
21:57  bot-t: .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
21:57  danktamagachi: firefox
21:57  Ryro: so you're building a slider based on a mouse gesture of sorts?
21:58  eTiger13: danktamagachi: i only see it flash on the initial page load
21:58  danktamagachi: eTiger13: I only have this issue when using hide() with an animation function
21:58  freedgy: Ryro: normal image carousel, but also has dragging support.. so eventually on an iPad you can just flick your finger to trigger the carousel.. works great so far, but it's allowing dragging -X at the begining and such.. which just messes everything up
21:59  danktamagachi: eTiger13: that's the problem! it doesn't flash on page load when the hide() method has no animation attached, only when i added the ("Highlight", 750)
21:59  Ryro: freedgy: sounds interesting

22:00  compaq: Love this piece of code here: ('img').error(function() { $(this).remove();  });
22:01  freedgy: Which brings me to my next question... :) So the dragging works great on a comp w/ mouse... on iphone / ipad so far it seems like flicking your finger is not considered a 'drag'.. any ideas?
