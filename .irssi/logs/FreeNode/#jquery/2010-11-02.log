00:06  schnork: hi
00:06  schnork: Quick question: Is it possible to get an html element from a jQuery object ?
00:07  rmurphey: ? get @ schnork
00:07  bot-t: schnork, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
00:07  rmurphey: is that what you mean?
00:07  schnork: let me see
00:07  Lumpio-: Or you could just do [0]
00:08  schnork: oh
00:08  schnork: ok, thanks
00:09  schnork: I feel stupid, now ;-)
00:10  rmurphey: schnork: nah it's actually not a super-well-known method
00:11  schnork: rmurphey: That's true the name isn't really explicit. But I'm using it often, and I didn't pay attention to taht
00:12  _Pepr_: Evening everyone. Does anyone know a good way to iterate over a JS object's available function?
00:12  ajpiano: for...in ?
00:12  _Pepr_: sorry meant a Javascript  Objects' available funtions
00:13  ajpiano: for... in?
00:13  ajpiano: or $.each
00:13  ajpiano: either way
00:13  _Pepr_: maybe,  but Object.keys() is an ECMA 5, new feature, and I was hoping to find something that would even work on IE6
00:13  ajpiano: a for in loop works on ie6, as does jquery each
00:14  _Pepr_: hmmm.. I must be doing something wrong, cause I was getting a error every time.
00:14  _Pepr_: I was using the $.each method, cause I love jQuery and will use it anytime I get the chance :)
00:14  ajpiano: for (k in obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(k) && jQuery.isFunction(k) {  alert("ITS A Function!!!");  }  }
00:15  ajpiano: missing a paren in there, but irc isn't an IDE
00:15  _Pepr_: thank you aj, very nice.. I will tweak.. although I am sure I was doing it that way
00:16  jerome187: wow that was fun debugging
00:16  _Pepr_: One more quick question. What is the most cross-browser compatible way to get the OBJECT tag object in JS
00:16  _Pepr_: *jQuery
00:17  l4rk: jQuery("object")[0] ?
00:18  _Pepr_: sorry meant to add it has an id. But that would mean that it is.. jQuery('#idofoject')[0]? or jQuery('#idofobject').get(0) ?
00:18  _Pepr_: The reason I am asking is that it goes hand in hand with my first question.
00:19  ajpiano: [0] == .get(0)
00:19  ajpiano: _Pepr_, when you said JS Object, did you mean, a javascript object, or a Javascript HTML Object Element
00:20  _Pepr_: I am trying to write a method that will grab the object of the dom ( in this case the OBJECT tag ) and read all the functions it has available.
00:21  _Pepr_: So in essence, grab the HTML Object in the DOM and see if it has functions available. More specifically for properiteary plugins like Flash and Silverlight.
00:22  rmurphey: _Pepr_: dumb question but, can you just check that the method you want is available?
00:23  _Pepr_: and hopefully if all works the end goal is to be able to create a Object Tag in a DOM for either WMP ( Windows Media Player ) and/or QuickTime , and then discover the functions that it has available so that I can control it ( the movie or audio  that would play in it )
00:24  _Pepr_: I could rmurphey, but in the case of dynamically loading OS native capability, there is no real guarentee cause that would force my plugin to have to have a library of all the possible methods ( Win, Mac, Linux ) could have.
00:24  _Pepr_: I was trying to avoid that.
00:24  _Pepr_: since I can regex for the simple stuff, like Play, Pause, FF, rewind.
00:30  _Pepr_: Thanks ajpiano, the direction helped me tweak the function. It is not perfect, but it gets the job done. Cheers
00:30  ajpiano: woot
00:31  _Pepr_: As per usual, this a great channel thanks for all the help.

00:43  Tatsh: anyone here ever used jcarousel?
00:43  Tatsh: i'm using the drupal module that implements it but the initialisation looks really bad
00:44  Tatsh: not sure which element(s) to hide at init of the page
00:44  HarryPitfall: How I can validate a file input before the submit?
00:44  Brodingo: i used the drupal module but stopped because it was having problems loading stylesheets in ie6/ie7
00:44  HarryPitfall: like "please, select a file!"
00:45  HarryPitfall: .val() returns the filename?
00:45  Brodingo: so i just used the plugin and HTML list in views
00:46 --- johnathanb_ is now known as johnathanb
00:46  HarryPitfall: .val() returns the filename without path, or empty if no file is selected

00:55  babbos: how can i load on a jQuery selection a request for a page? e.g. $('#myid').get('http://url.com'); ... but this doesn't work...
00:55  ajpiano: ?load
00:55  bot-t: .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
00:55  ajpiano: ffuu

01:03  pifantastic: can you give the ftitle div an id?
01:04  Northwoods: pifantastic: not really since you can see i have more than 1 ftitle
01:05  pifantastic: Northwoods: use $(this).closest(".filter").find(".ftitle");
01:07  Northwoods: pi - fantastic , it worked :)

01:22  insaynewrapper: Hey does anyone know where to find documentation for jQuery UI that I can download and read offline?
01:22  ajpiano: insaynewrapper, unfortunately, i dno't think we have offline docs for ui right now
01:23  insaynewrapper: Ah bummer. my dev pc doesn't have internet access atm..
01:24  destinydriven: insaynewrapper: get a book  .. . apress I think
01:24  insaynewrapper: Great idea thanks destinydriven!

01:35  EGreg_: hey
01:35  EGreg_: how do I remove or disable an option in a select via jquery
01:36  EGreg_: .hide() doesn't seem to work
01:36  EGreg_: .remove() works
01:36  EGreg_: .attr('disabled', 'disabled') doesn't work either
01:36  EGreg_: in chrom
01:36  EGreg_: e
01:36  coldhead: i'd use the one that works
01:37  EGreg_: yeah but then I need to restore it later
01:37  EGreg_: so .remove kinda sucks
01:37  EGreg_: in that regard
01:37  EGreg_: why can't they dynamically be disabled
01:37  AaronCicali: eTiger13: sorry once again... had to run out.  You asked a question, the answer is yes... .html()
01:37  AaronCicali: :)
01:38 --- abdelm is now known as deadocelot
01:38  EGreg_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/877328/jquery-disable-select-options-based-on-radio-selected-need-support-for-all-brows
01:38  EGreg_: AHA
01:38  eTiger13: AaronCicali: what was the question?
01:38  EGreg_: The proper way to achieve the functionality you want is just to remove the options. As you discovered the hard way, disabling individual options is not supported particularly well across browsers
01:38  AaronCicali: you asked how I was getting content into the DOM... wait...
01:38  AaronCicali: no, you asked where it was coming from... $.post()
01:39  eTiger13: EGreg_:  create a hidden select and move the option to that one and then you can move it back again
01:39  AaronCicali: lol.  I'm still trying to figure out if there's a tricky way to determine when DOM content is finished loading
01:39  l4rk: i wanna select your hidden option
01:39  AaronCicali: I've got a grid that caches pages
01:39  l4rk: and move it
01:39  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  so then call your ajax loading icon and then in the post callback, remove it
01:39  EGreg_: etiger: thanks, good advice
01:39  eTiger13: psht. i know
01:39  AaronCicali: eTiger13: right... but for pages that are cached, there's no ajax call
01:40  Joshua__: Alright, if you were here earlier I ran into an error where time_left $("time_left); was resulting in an error and nobody managed to figure out what it was.
01:40  AaronCicali: it's just a call to .html()
01:40  Joshua__: #time_left rather
01:40  AaronCicali: and it still can take a second or so
01:40  AaronCicali: but without a loading indicator :(
01:40  Joshua__: turns out you can't have a variable name with the same name as your id in IE.
01:40  EGreg_: but still, it would be hard to keep track of what place to put it back into
01:40  EGreg_: bah
01:41  EGreg_: I guess I'll prepend it
01:41  EGreg_: when I put it back
01:41  EGreg_: still, it sucks that you can't just disable options in selects with js
01:41  EGreg_: across all browsers.
01:41  AaronCicali: you can't?
01:41  AaronCicali: what about attr('disabled', 'disabled') ??
01:42  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  what are you adding that takes that long?
01:42 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
01:42  AaronCicali: DOM content
01:42  AaronCicali: from a cache
01:42  AaronCicali: http://aaroncicali.com/jquery-plugins/grid/
01:42  AaronCicali: visit a few pages, then go back and forth
01:42  AaronCicali: previously visited pages get cached
01:42  AaronCicali: but they still take a second or so to render
01:43  AaronCicali: only new pages show the loading indicator
01:43  AaronCicali: since cached pages only need a call to .html(), the loading indicator hides() immediately
01:44  AaronCicali: which sucks because it feels unresponsive
01:44  EGreg_: okay, works
01:44  EGreg_: although the order is wrong
01:44  EGreg_: but at least it works
01:44  EGreg_: nope doesnt work in chrome try it
01:44  EGreg_: heh
01:46  eTiger13: AaronCicali: grid.js youre render function, why are you constructing the html everytime instead of constructing it once and caching that
01:46  AaronCicali: huh?
01:46  AaronCicali: right over my head
01:47  AaronCicali: I tried caching the markup, but it didn't provide any additional performance benefit, and my future plans will be much easier without cached markup
01:47  AaronCicali: so I just cache the data
01:47  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  thats what you are talking about right? the .html in the render method?
01:47  AaronCicali: yeah
01:47  AaronCicali: what's grid.js?
01:47  AaronCicali: oh... MY grid.js?
01:47  AaronCicali: lol
01:48  AaronCicali: right... so I did try caching the markup too, didn't make any difference
01:48  AaronCicali: when I add editable, it'll be much easier without cached markup
01:49  AaronCicali: thing is... even if I set it to 10,000 rows per page, I think the loop to add markup is trivial
01:50  AaronCicali: seems like there's no way to get a loading indicator for me :(
01:52  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  replace your grid.js with this: http://jsfiddle.net/GErwS/
01:52  eTiger13: and then let me know when it is up
01:53  AaronCicali: it's up
01:54  AaronCicali: not seeing your changes yet...
01:54  AaronCicali: ahh... loading.hide() moved to render()
01:54  AaronCicali: but it doesn't fix it
01:55  AaronCicali: I thought at one point that maybe it's just taking long because the browser has to render the table, but fixing the column widths didn't solve it
01:57 --- abdelm is now known as deadocelot
01:57  eTiger13: ?html
01:57  bot-t: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
02:01  AaronCicali: I really liked the idea of caching... prefetching too, but I'm not so sure they're even useful if they break the loading indicator
02:04  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  try this: http://jsfiddle.net/GErwS/1/
02:05  AaronCicali: exnay
02:07  AaronCicali: I actually tried something similar, setting a background image for the container
02:07  AaronCicali: didn't work.  Also, if I $container.html(), then $container.html(html), the container doesn't ever appear empty
02:08  eTiger13: AaronCicali: http://jsfiddle.net/GErwS/2/
02:08  AaronCicali: :)
02:08  AaronCicali: thanks for all your help
02:09  AaronCicali: it's up
02:10  pepone: Hi is posible to append elements to an element before append it to dom,  i want to do $("<applet></applet>").append("<p>Foo</p>); but that seems  to not work
02:11  pifantastic: $("<applet><p>Foo</p></applet>");
02:11  pepone: pifantastic: but i want to add a lot of params and prefer to avoid create all the markup as a big string
02:12  snover: pielgrzym: :(
02:12  parndt: yo - is it accurate to say we don't need <meta /> in HTML5?
02:12  snover: pifantastic: :(:(
02:12  parndt: as in, self closing
02:12  eTiger13: var html = $('<applet />'); html.append('<p />').text('Foo');
02:12  snover: pepone: <applet> is deprecated forever
02:12  snover: pepone: use <object>
02:13  snover: pepone: Better yet, don’t use Java applets
02:13  pifantastic: pepone: this works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/r3HGE/
02:13  pepone: snover: Object doesn't work very well in all browsers
02:13  snover: pepone: it works fine.
02:13  snover: Java applets are so…quaint
02:13  Gate: snover: you do not have <object> in your inventory
02:13  snover: A technology even more pitiful than Flash
02:13  Gate: </textAdventureGameReference>
02:14  snover: Gate: I don’t know how to “you”
02:14  coldhead: technology is killing music
02:14  l4rk: music is killing technology
02:14  parndt: politics is killing both
02:14  pepone: pifantastic: i have say before append to DOM you do $('body').append
02:14  AaronCicali: I'm killing politics
02:14  coldhead: both is politicking killing
02:14  pepone: but that way the applet tag is crated an iterpreted before the params are added
02:15  pifantastic: pepone: I dont understand you
02:15  coldhead: created* interpreted*
02:15  coldhead: and*
02:16  pifantastic: pepone: "i have say before append to DOM you" <-- can you rephrase that?
02:16  pepone: pifantastic: if you do $('body').append('<applet></applet>').append('<p> foo</p>'); it works , but that way the appelt tag is aded to dom and later p tag is append to applet
02:16  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  just for fun: http://jsfiddle.net/GErwS/3/
02:16  pifantastic: pepone: is that not what you want?
02:16  pepone: i want to create the applet tag append params to it and then add the tag to dom
02:17  AaronCicali: k
02:17  AaronCicali: I'm not so sure it's even possible eTiger13
02:17  AaronCicali: it's just not in JavaScript's nature
02:18  pifantastic: $('<applet />').append($('<param />').attr("name", "lollerz"));
02:18  parndt: is it accurate to say we don't need <meta /> in HTML5? (self closing tags)?
02:18  pifantastic: parndt: technically you dont
02:18  pepone: pifantastic: that seems to not work to me
02:19  parndt: pifantastic: it makes me feel uneasy having unclosed tags.
02:19  pifantastic: parndt: then close them
02:19  pifantastic: parndt:  nobody has a gun to your head
02:20  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  yeah the html you are injecting is just so large that the browser is taking a bit to render it. it thinks it has but it hasnt.
02:20  parndt: pifantastic: just sayin'
02:20  parndt: I guess it's a hangover from XHTML
02:20  pifantastic: parndt: free your mind
02:20  AaronCicali: even setting the column widths explicitly doesn't help the rendering speed
02:20  parndt: pifantastic: hah
02:20  AaronCicali: it's really just a UI issue... I need another way to let the user know that something's happening
02:20  pifantastic: pepone: this works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/r3HGE/2/
02:21  AaronCicali: it's not so bad when it's only a few hundred rows
02:21  AaronCicali: but it's still confusing that sometimes there's a loading screen and sometimes nothing
02:23  snover: parndt: There are two dialects of HTML5
02:23  snover: parndt: It’s not a holdover of anything
02:23  snover: parndt: There is HTML-style HTML5 and XML-style HTML5. They are both valid.
02:24  parndt: snover: which one's your favourite
02:24  snover: XML-style HTML5.
02:24  AaronCicali: I like tuhdles
02:26  AaronCicali: so... what do you do when you're using .html(MASSIVE_DOM_OBJECT) and you need to show the user some sort of loading indicator?
02:27  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  you could try $container.html('').hide().html(html).fadeIn('slow', function() { $loading.hide(); }); it might make the UI slower but it also might work
02:28  AaronCicali: hmmm... that might do the trick.
02:28  AaronCicali: I event thought about using a setTimeout() on loading.hide()
02:28  AaronCicali: lemme see
02:31  ner0x: Anyone having issues with the jquery ui dialogs just removing the HTML?
02:31  pepone: this doesn't works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/r3HGE/2/ any ideas?
02:31  snover: what?
02:31  snover: pepone: I already told you. STOP USING <APPLET>.
02:32  snover: AaronCicali: How massive is massive?
02:33  snover: All eTiger13’s suggestion is prone to do is make your app even less responsive
02:33  pepone: snover: there is any difference in append tags to Object?
02:33  AaronCicali: http://aaroncicali.com/jquery-plugins/grid/
02:33  AaronCicali: my grid caches, but since .html() is synchronous, I can't have a loading indicator
02:33  AaronCicali: and it still takes a while to render the cached pages
02:33  snover: AaronCicali: you know this has been solved…see slickgrid
02:34  AaronCicali: there are many grids
02:34  AaronCicali: I like mine :)
02:34  AaronCicali: it's flexible and lightweight
02:34  snover: mmmmk.
02:34  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  my original changes seem faster and according to the timer, seem about 10-20% faster
02:35  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  try the fading thing
02:35  snover: and then there’s slickgrid
02:35  snover: which doesn’t have this problem
02:37  AaronCicali: no hosted demo?
02:37  AaronCicali: :(
02:37  snover: uh, yes hosted demo
02:37  snover: http://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples
02:38  eTiger13: AaronCicali:  actually the best advice i can give you is to not try and render 5000 rows at once. break them down into smaller chunks, like 1000 or less
02:39  AaronCicali: thanks eTiger13
02:39  AaronCicali: and snover
02:42  AaronCicali: I actually don't plan to page 5000 rows at once, this was just for demoing the load indicator problem
02:42  AaronCicali: it's pretty fast with 1000 rows and that'll be fine for my application
02:45  jerome187: anyone know how to pass multiple arguments to this thing? http://www.davecomeau.net/blog/56/jQuery+Plugin%3A+externalInterface
02:46  ner0x: can you have more than one dialog at once?
02:46  ner0x: Loaded on the page?
02:46  jerome187: $('#myFlashMovie').externalInterface({method:'flashMethodToCall', args:'args for actionscript'}); but how do you pass more than one argument?
02:46  jerome187: ner0x: no I don't think you can
02:46  ner0x: Hm. How about initialized but not "open" ?
02:47  jerome187: I dunno
02:47  ner0x: It's literally just removing the html from the dom.
02:48  ner0x: It's quite frustrating.
02:48  jerome187: huh
02:50  jerome187: use something else.  like a jquery dialog.
02:50  jerome187: you can have as many of those as you want, I think.
02:51  ner0x: Oh, that's what I meant.
02:51  ner0x: I'm using that and it's just removing the html. For no good reason.
02:52  jerome187: i've only used one at a time so far, but I think you can have many of them.  see if your re-using the same name to many times.
02:53  jerome187: http://www.davecomeau.net/blog/56/jQuery+Plugin%3A+externalInterface   that function is only 37 lines.  I don't understand it though.
02:53  ner0x: I've used them before. It's odd that it just removes the HTML.

02:56  vysical: is there a way to determine if an event has been fired up normally or because it got triggered manually?
03:01  danheberden: vysical: the one you trigger will have document as currenttarget
03:01  danheberden: the actual triggered one will have the source elemend
03:01  danheberden: *element
03:01  danheberden: actual triggered - that's a bit misleading - the event fired by the user, not by your code
03:04  vysical: and this target is in the event-var i guess
03:04 --- abdelm is now known as deadocelot
03:05  jerome187: http://www.davecomeau.net/blog/56/jQuery+Plugin%3A+externalInterface   function is only 37 lines, I don't see how you can pass multiple arguments to it though, can you?
03:06  danheberden: jerome187: what do you mean?
03:07  danheberden: vysical: ya, target's the dispatcher
03:07  binaryfus10nz: how do you use a prevAll type thing if the elements are siblings not child / parent
03:07  danheberden: binaryfus10nz: prevAll IS for siblings
03:07  binaryfus10nz: maybe someone can help me with simple issue..
03:07  binaryfus10nz: http://pastie.org/1265649
03:07  danheberden: not children or parents
03:07  binaryfus10nz: ok well check it out
03:07  binaryfus10nz: thats my code... I want it only to look within the parent which is '.event'
03:08  danheberden: k
03:08  danheberden: by the way, class names of the element type aren't best practic
03:08  binaryfus10nz: so on btn-gue find the sibling .form only
03:08  danheberden: *practice
03:08  danheberden: ahh
03:08  binaryfus10nz: well its an element that is reused
03:08  danheberden: yah, just saying you could name it more functinally - but that's beside the point of what you need here
03:08  binaryfus10nz: but either way how do I say relate only to the sibling element
03:08  danheberden: $(this).siblings(''.form')
03:08  binaryfus10nz: let me try 1 sec
03:08  danheberden: where "this" is the .btn-gue that triggered the click event
03:09  danheberden: things like siblings(), find(), children()
03:09  binaryfus10nz: hmm doesnt work
03:09  danheberden: is if for sure a sibling?
03:09  danheberden: paste a bit of the markup too
03:09  binaryfus10nz: does it matter the order in which they are?
03:09  danheberden: nah, not really
03:09  binaryfus10nz: I can just show you live version 1 sec
03:09  danheberden: cool

07:47  ancestral: Alright, I'm stuck
07:47  ancestral: What's happening is I'm iterating through an array of 3 items trying to get some values from different JSON files
07:48  imakewebthings: aaroninfidel: var.function will just effect that one variable.  Any new var() calls don't get that method.  If you add it to the prototype, var.prototype.function, then any new creations also get the method
07:48  ancestral: image paths, and setting the background of an element to that image path, but what's happening is it's only taking the last pass through the for loop

08:01  ancestral: The goal is to have three <li> each with a unique background-image. Each <li> has its own JSON file.
08:01  imakewebthings: understood
08:02  ancestral: When I loop through the array which holds the names of each of the three <li> I am about to write, it only holds on to the last passthrough
08:02  ancestral: Simplified: http://pastebin.com/vqS6CccP
08:02  imakewebthings: out of curiousity, why do you do comma separated string
08:02  imakewebthings: instead of just a native array in the json
08:03  ancestral: Limitation of the input I'm given, otherwise yes, I'd use a native array
08:03  mekwall: ancestral, you shouldn't loop through an array with for var in

I have a first function that contains an html("") clear function followed by an append function that appends <img class="next"> and then I have a second function which called the first function.  So it clears and appends something new.  Then I have third function.  $('.next').click(function() {alert('Handler for .click222() called.');  This 3rd function works when the page loads, I get the alert, but wh
10:01  compaq: en it updates once, ie if function 2 calls function 1 again, after the page is done loading the first time, function 3 fails
10:02  timing: mekwall: true :-), but there are channels were I ask stupid questions, then they tell me this, so I want to feel like the big guys once in a while

10:38  compaq: sean`, I am, but it doesn't work though, but let me see what you did
10:38  zalun: so it should always be different
10:38  sean`: lol
10:38  sean`: 3 times B
10:38  sean`: compaq, my test works lol
10:38  naimon: sean`: thanks for your answer but it's not what I mean

10:39  zalun: one was indeed a B, the second was actually equal
10:39  naimon: *at top of the image
10:39  sean`: naimon, use gyazo or something to capture what you mean

10:42  zalun: perceiving speed depending on the spinner delay
10:42  naimon: Is it possible to make a page like that yet?
10:42  sean`: zalun, if you show the spinner longer than necessary, yeah, you'll think it atkes longer
10:43  zalun: sean`: it's a little more complicated
10:44  zalun: the delay might be too long and then there is the "broken button" feeling

10:53  sean`: ofcourse
10:53  encompass: but it's not using the scroll wheel
10:53  sean`: Look at the classes man!
10:53  encompass: hehe

10:54  sean`: did you are unimpressed?
10:54  sean`: encompass, $('#combobox').val () ?
10:54  sean`: never mind
10:54  oodavid: encompass: $(this).find ("#ComboBox option:selected").text() ??
10:54  sean`: encompass, what it this?
10:54  sean`: $(this).find ('option:selected').text ()

11:17  sean`: oh wait, I didn't see the each
11:17  sean`: Dude.. that's like.. totally not done
11:18  sean`: ranza, you shudn't do appending inside an each/itterator
11:18  ranza: why not?
11:18  sean`: ranza, see http://jsfiddle.net/5CHzA/2/

11:29  compaq: is there a way to know in jquery, if a file on the server exists?  If not, I am guessing it should know the file size, and if its zero, then it doesn't exist
11:30  oodavid: compaq: you'd have to talk to your backend to do that
11:30  kuya: should undelegate() with no args clear up all event handlers on an object?
11:31  compaq: oodavid, I think it can be done is jquery though
11:32  compaq: if you use jquery to post an image, and the src doesn't exist it just post an empy box, so there may be a way to know that the box is empty and there is no image there
11:33  kuya: this seems to show that undelegate() is a little broken imo http://jsbin.com/ehani4/4/edit
11:33  oodavid: that's not really the same thing
11:33  compaq: oodavid, true
11:33  compaq: oodavid, but it would work practically
11:34  oodavid: checking to see if a file exists on the server is different to seeing if a user selected a file for upload
11:34  sean`: compaq, you could do an ajax call
11:34  sean`: if it errors out, it prolly doesn't exists
11:34  sean`: check the statuscode/
11:35  oodavid: well, if you're checking for large files, AJAX is a bad idea, make an interim PHP script that will check for you with file_exists (or equivilent) and throw a result in JSON
11:36  sean`: kuya, /wii var ?
11:36  compaq: sean`, thanks
11:36  compaq: oodavid, thanks
11:36  kuya: sean`: ?
11:36  sean`: compaq, not adviced !
11:36  sean`: oh wait
11:38  compaq: in html, you can specify alt if which will be loaded if src does not exist, or is user has img turned off, so there should be a way to detect in jquery.  I will google for a while  then
11:38  oodavid: compaq: ohhhh
11:38  oodavid: totally misunderstood the question
11:39  oodavid: if it's just for <img src=".." /> I think you can grab an error event
11:39  oodavid: ?error @ compaq
11:39  bot-t: compaq, .error(handler): Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/error/

12:03  yonk: Hi people, how i can wait the response of getJSON. While i wait the response i want to show a loading image.
12:04  onre: yonk, display the loading image right after calling getJSON and then hide it in the callback handler. it gets executed when request is complete.
12:06  yonk: aha, thank's onre, i was doing it ;)
12:07  Wipster: if I make a div I am using as a button sink when the user clicks it to load a new page, but I have noticed if they hit the back button the button is still in that sunken state. There a way to reset it? I guess .ready only is fired when it loads not with back and forward
12:08  compaq: timing, I tried the live() fix on error() but it didn't work
12:09  compaq: timing, I had the same issue with error() as I did with click()
12:09  mekwall: Wipster, why have it sunken as default state then?
12:11  Wipster: mekwall, well its not supposed to be, I dont think I have...

12:12  mekwall: lot = look
12:12  mekwall: hariom, you could as well be saying the following: "My car is black, but it should be blue. Why?"
12:12  timing: compaq: but it's working in my fiddle right?
12:13  compaq: timing, no, yes it is working, but not with error()
12:13  timing: compaq: k, do you have an updated fiddle?
12:13  alaing: hi i have a group of tabel that I want to combine an return as a string. I have $('.myTable') I think I have to use .map but I'm not to sure.
12:13  alaing: is there perhaps a better way
12:13  timing: and it's not a bug in click() it's just that the elements are gone you bound the events to
12:13  compaq: timing, ok, 1min
12:14  coldhead: http://desktop.sonspring.com/
12:14  hariom: mekwall: I can not reproduce it on jsfiddle bcoz it has some tal template code which can't run jsfiddle
12:14  hariom: mekwall: have you came across such a problem?
12:14  mekwall: hariom, so the error is elsewhere.
12:15  mekwall: hariom, impossible to help you if we don't know where the error is. and if you can't show us the error, why bother asking?
12:15  hariom: mekwall: have you came across such a problem?
12:15  mekwall: hariom, such as you? yes.
12:16  mekwall: now I'm off to lunch. coldhead, mind taking over? :)
12:16  hariom: Will see template to note if it is propogating from somehwere else
12:16  timing: alaing: you issue is very unclear, can you try to explain better?
12:17  compaq: timing, ok, here I didn't include the live yet, and you see the same issue happens, where it works in the beginning, but after you punch in the text box it doesn't work, http://jsfiddle.net/5CHzA/4/ , and then I will change it to the live version
12:17  alaing: timing: ok I have a group of tables $('.myTables') I want to combine the html of each table and then return the combined html as a string
12:18  compaq: timing, and in the live() version it doesn't work at all
12:18  compaq: timing, http://jsfiddle.net/5CHzA/5/
12:18  timing: alaing: iterate over it with each() and then append .html() to a string which you can later use again
12:19  timing: compaq: where does the error event come from?
12:19  alaing: timing: oh I see I was making it more complicated than it needed to be,,,,,i.e by trying to use .map
12:19  timing: compaq: is that when the image cannot be loaded?
12:19  timing: alaing: hehe, no worries :-)
12:20  compaq: timing, yeah, so the first time, you see you get four errors, which is right, but then after you edit, it doesn't come again,  and then when I change it to the live() version, the errors don't come at all
12:20  timing: hmm interesting
12:21  matt1982: i have a loop that is calling a function. Inside this function it displays a dialog which content varies depending parts of the loop. However it flies through and leaves the last dialog active. What should I look into to get them to display in a chain. Im struggling to hit to correct term in google
12:21  mareq133: @oodavid @10:51 ...perfect. just what I needed. Big Thank You for this one.

12:25  coldhead: matt1982: you want a blocking dialog
12:25  compaq: timing, put it at the top of the page?
12:25  coldhead: such as alert()
12:27  matt1982: coldhead, right a blocking dialog i will look into that
12:27  matt1982: thanks coldhead
12:27  coldhead: good luck!
12:27  compaq: timing, or put it in the keyup function
12:29  timing: compaq: I would add it in the my_function
12:29  compaq: timing, do I still need live()?
12:31  sean`: compaq, still with that shit
12:31  compaq: sean`, I am gonna try to change it around to a better style later, but I wanna get it going for now, cause this way is working, but later, I will revise to a more elegant style
12:32  sean`: what you have now
12:33  matt1982: coldhead, actually I have just realised it is the same dialog DIV, just the content that is changing withing the inner div. It looks to be overidding the HTML
12:35  coldhead: so maybe you need to set a timeout or bind a function to the OK button so your code knows when to keep going?
12:35  compaq: sean`, I am having trouble with error(), it only works once, but then after I edit the text box, it doesn't work again.  And when I add live() keep it working all the time, it doesn't work at all, not even the first time: http://jsfiddle.net/5CHzA/6/
12:36  matt1982: coldhead, ahh good idea thanks for the idea
12:36  timing: compaq: not for the error
12:36  timing: compaq: but for the click yes
12:36  compaq: timing, the click works yes
12:39  compaq: timing, see, I have dir that will have images, and I want to write a function that will cycle through the images as I click them, and then when it reaches the last one, to go back to the beginning.  So my plan was, I would have a.jpg, then a1.jpg, thne a2.jpg..and finally alast.jpg, so when it reaches alast+1.jpg, and would use .live('error', function()) to change the image src file name to a.jpg again, and it would start over
12:39  timing: compaq: http://jsfiddle.net/5CHzA/7/
12:40  timing: compaq: can't you tell the javascript what the max is?
12:40  compaq: timing, omg, thanks so much
12:40  compaq: timing, yeah, but I was think this way, I could add images to the directory without changing code
12:40  timing: compaq: I set the src attribute after the error()
12:41  timing: you want to add images while the people are on the page?

12:42  EtotheK: thanks
12:42  timing: and even kapowaz tries to do it better!
12:42  compaq: no, not while on the page, but before or after, but I want to just be able to open the directory, see that the images go up to say a5.jpg, and then add one called a6.jpg
12:43  timing: well, then set a javascript var based on a php var?
12:43  timing: var maxNumberOfImages = <?=$maxNumOfImages?>;
12:43  sean`: DUDE
12:43  sean`: Lucky we're not in ##php, otherwhise I'd kill you
12:44  timing: haha why?
12:44  sean`: Don't use shorthand tags
12:44  beasty_: lol
12:44  compaq: timing, thanks
12:44  beasty_: shorttags
12:44  timing: sean`: I just asked in #php, now you can bash me :-)
12:44  sean`: I'm not there
12:44  timing: o you were last time
12:44  sean`: so just imagine me
12:45  timing: I will wait for them
12:45  sean`: yes, today my client refuses to autojoin, so I just joined the channels I like the most
12:45  beasty_: btw <? conflicts with <?xml ;)
12:45  silv3r_m00n: to select all a tags which have the data-hotkey attribute is this ok >> $('a[@data-hotkey]') ?
12:46  timing: sean`: thanks for the compliment about the channel you like most
12:46  timing: sean`: hmm they are not that bad about it
12:46  compaq: timing, $maxNumOfImages? is a predifined php variable?
12:46  timing: sean`: it's just that servers should be configured to support it, but I knew that already
12:47  timing: compaq: no, that's what you detect based on count(glob('a*.jpg'));
12:47  timing: compaq: are the images places local?
12:47  timing: *placed
12:47  compaq: timing, yep
12:47  timing: then you should count the images on pageload
12:47  compaq: timing, those are php commands?
12:47  timing: tell your javascript about the max number of images
12:47  timing: yeah
12:48  compaq: timing, so you saying error() is not a good idea?
12:48  compaq: timing, its not going to be reliable eh?
12:49  timing: I don't think it's that reliable
12:50  compaq: I wrote this stuff in PHP first using echo to punch in html, and then I switched to javascript cause I thought it would be faster, but working with elements with error prone when you just make up your framework as you go along, so now I am in jquery, and I want all to be in jquery, lol
12:51  compaq: Like appendChild in javascript, people do it, but I couldn't working
12:52  compaq: I made a header.php, top.php, middle.php, footer.php...files, and then my index.php file just had those mentioned in there
12:52  compaq: So instead of appending, I would just reload the whole page
12:53  compaq: I guess thats what wordpress and joomla pretty much do, something like that
12:54  compaq: won't function bindError(img){} affect all img's on the page?
12:55  silv3r_m00n: wats wrong with this >> $("a[@href]") ?
12:55  compaq: silv3r_m00n, I never knew about it
12:56  compaq: This code is going over my head
12:56  erichynds: silv3r_m00n, ditch the @
12:57  silv3r_m00n: I need this actually $('a[@data-hotkey]')
12:57  silv3r_m00n: all a tags with an attribute data-hotkey
12:57  erichynds: ditch the @
12:57  silv3r_m00n: why ?
12:57  erichynds: because that's how you do it
12:57  silv3r_m00n: let me try
12:57  erichynds: it's a css selector
12:57  silv3r_m00n: it worked
12:58  silv3r_m00n: but what does this mean >> $('a[data-hotkey]') ?
12:58  silv3r_m00n: according to XPATH @ means to see if the attribute is there or not
12:58  silv3r_m00n: is it different from xpath ?
12:58  erichynds: jquery uses CSS selectors, not xpath
12:58  markj: where do people get these crazy ideas from
12:58  erichynds: jquery used to, back in like version 1.2
12:59  silv3r_m00n: hmm , then may be
12:59  markj: i dont remember ever using xpath with jquery so maybe before i started using it
12:59  compaq: I though jquery uses XPath too
12:59  erichynds: not xpath, but the xpath @ attribute style
12:59  erichynds: i don't think xpath itself was ever supported
13:00  markj: the old selectors page does mention xpath, so probably http://docs.jquery.com/DOM/Traversing/Selectors
13:01  silv3r_m00n: elem.click()   , doesn't that trigger the click event on the elem ?
13:01  silv3r_m00n: I have an a tag in elem but elem.click() doesn't change the page ?
13:02  compaq: timing, where did you learn to code like that, I can't even read it.  Are you part of the jquery development team.  Did you design jquery?
13:04  compaq: timing, oh I see...

13:21  Guest52747: thanks.. will see...
13:23  compaq: timing, I got it now, you append it, but it doesn't have a src yet, then you set up the error(), then you set the src, which triggers the error() if there is no image.  Right?
13:23  compaq: timing, I can't imaging how you could have figured it works like that.  You need to have the checker in place and waiting, then set the src. If you set the src, and then set the error(), it will wait for the src to change, before being triggered
13:24  OhaiBBQ: what are you talking about o:
13:24  compaq: OhaiBBQ, error()
13:24  timing: compaq: yes that's right!
13:25  compaq: timing, you are gonna laugh, but why do you need bindError() then?
13:25  hariom: how to check if there is a particular key:value pair available in the Ajax's JSON response?
13:25  timing: compaq: well the comment at the error() dopcs said that you can't set the src and then add the error handler
13:25  hariom: only key existance check
13:26  timing: compaq: o sorry you can delete that one, forgot to remove it
13:26  compaq: timing, I got that part, but I would never have surmised that you need to have the <img set up fist
13:27  timing: well that way the element is there
13:27  timing: so i can attach the event to it
13:31  compaq: timing, I see, so when the code run error(), it needs to attach.
13:31  compaq: timing, of course
13:31  compaq: timing, thats a major lesson in programming
13:32  imakewebthings: hariom:  if (data.key == undefined) ...       if i understand your question right
13:33  compaq: timing, I need to know who to make the element ID connect with the for loop too
13:39  hariom: imakewebthings: yea, you got it right. I want to find if key is available in data. So when I do data.key I don't get error

14:01  timing:  [name=password]
14:01  compaq: why couldn't it just be <img id="img + 'textBox[i]'"
14:01  compaq: timing, cause if I delete the last + it breaks
14:01  timing: compaq: the string is now between: ' '
14:01  timing: the double quotes are the html

14:19  tiemonster: How can I compare two jQuery selectors to ensure they point to the same object?
14:20  pi3r: i catch a click event on a '<a>'  inside a '<tr>' and i want to do something like that $(this).parent('tr').css('color', 'red') but it doesn't work

14:21  bdahl: question: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/constrain-movement.html, resize the browser window small enough so that the scroll bar appears, grab the 'I'm contained in my parent div', scroll the window, the containment becomes broken until you drag the image around? anybody know how to harden the containment when the window is scrolled either with the mouse wheel or because the dragged object is near the window edge?
14:21  pi3r: tiemonster, :D but the syntax is good?
14:22  tiemonster: pi3r: didn't check. try .find("td") and try again
14:22  tiemonster: (after parent)
14:22  nlogax: tiemonster: if you're only interested in the selector, jquery objects have a .selector property that you can look at
14:22  tiemonster: nlogax: I want to compare jQuery objects
14:23  nlogax: tiemonster: for same object or same contents?
14:23  nlogax: same object is just ===
14:23  tiemonster: same jQuery object, stored in different variables
14:23  tiemonster: equality returns false
14:23  pi3r: tiemonster, nope doesn't work
14:24  nlogax: tiemonster: then it's not the same object :)

14:24  timing: juha_ yes but only from the same domain
14:24  nlogax: not if you just want to see if it's the same object
14:24  tiemonster: nlogax: hm... didn't think of ===
14:24  timing: juha_: window.parent.window.hello();
14:25  timing: juha_: or something like that
14:25  tiemonster: the [0] trick works, too
14:27  juha_: timing: ok, so won't help me

14:30  compaq: what's the difference between "img'+textBox[i]+'" vs "img"+"textBox[i]", cause there is a difference, but I have no idea what
14:32  Poetro: compaq: "textBox[i]" is a string
14:32  nlogax: the second one concats two constant strings, "img" and "textBox[i]", -> "imgtextBox[i]"
14:32  Poetro: the other is the value of textBox[i]

14:33  bLUEEE: is there anyway to pass the 2 as a parameter ??!
14:33  compaq: Poetro, thanks
14:33  nlogax: yes, var foo = 2; blaba visible: foo });
14:34  nlogax: if that's what you mean
14:34  compaq: Is " ", and ' ' the same or different?
14:34  bLUEEE: yeh thats what i mean
14:34  Poetro: compaq: it is almost the same
14:34  nlogax: same, compaq. you have to be consistent, though
14:34  Poetro: compaq: the value is the same if that was the question
14:37  compaq: In my program, it works with "img'+textBox[i]+'" but breaks with "img"+"textBox[i]", and breaks with "img'+textBox[i]'"
14:38  Brodingo: holler
14:38  compaq: Whats the difference between "img'+textBox[i]+'" vs "img'+textBox[i]'" ?
14:38  compaq: man...I am mental or something, cause I just can't see it
14:38  Poetro: compaq: try to console.log it
14:39  compaq: Poetro, you don't see a difference either?

14:42  Poetro: compaq: try to read some docs about strings and concatination
14:42  compaq: timing, I don't see why it can't just be id="img"+textBox[i]
14:42  timing: compaq: look at the quotes carefully
14:42  Poetro: compaq: it depends on what you want to do
14:42  timing: i just SINGLE quotes in your example
14:43 --- rwaldron__ is now known as rwaldron
14:43  Poetro: compaq: and we dont c a full line of what you are doing
14:43  compaq: Poetro, yeah, try, sorry about that, I was gonna sent the whole line
14:43  timing: compaq: do you understand this: '<img id="img5" class="next"/>';
14:43  compaq: <img class=\"next\" src=\"alpha-images/" + textBox[i] + ".jpg\" width=\"50\" height=\"75\"/>"+" ");
14:43  timing: compaq: the strins is inside the single quotes
14:44  timing: compaq: if the string makes use of single quotes, you don't have to use backslashes
14:44  compaq: I understand that '<img id="img5" class="next"/>';
14:44  timing: okay
14:44  timing: dp you understand that this is a part of the above string: '<img id="img'
14:44  timing: ?
14:44  timing: then we have this part as well: '5'
14:45  timing: and this part: ' class="next"/>'
14:45  compaq: timing, as I understood it, that first ' is closed by /> '
14:45  timing: so we have the following parts: '<img id="img' '5' ' class="next"/>'
14:45  timing: compaq: do you anderstand the three different parts?
14:45  Poetro: '<img class="next" src="alpha-images\/' + textBox[i] + '.jpg" width="50" height="75" \/> '
14:45  compaq: timing, can you put dashes - between the three parts please
14:45  timing: easier: '<img id="img'           '5'              ' class="next"/>'
14:46  timing: are spaces okay too :-) ?
14:46  compaq: timing, yep,
14:46  timing: okay
14:46  timing: so let's say that '5' is a dynamic string
14:46  juha_: timing: i already do ajax cross-domain on this project ;)
14:46  timing: '<img id="img'            dynamicString            ' class="next"/>'
14:46  timing: juha_: lol okay :-)
14:46  compaq: timing, so it could have been '<img id="img +'textBox[i];+" class="next" width="50" height="75" /> ' just the same?
14:47  compaq: I have to save this converstation
14:47  juha_: getting data and posting
14:47  timing: compaq: no!
14:47  compaq: sorry
14:47  timing: the + sign is INSUDE your string
14:47  timing: INSIDE
14:47  juha_: compaq: you have typos on the code
14:47  compaq: timing, so it could have been '<img id="img +'textBox[i]'+" class="next" width="50" height="75" /> ' just the same?
14:47  timing: juha_: no, he just doesn't get it :-)
14:47  timing: NO!
14:47  Poetro: compaq: try to use an IDE that that has syntax highlighting
14:48  compaq: Poetro, I do, I use Kate
14:48  Poetro: compaq: then u'd see that u have a problem there
14:48  juha_: syntax highlight wont help
14:48  timing: this is the same:         '<img id="img'    +     textBox[i]      +       ' class="next" width="50" height="75" />'
14:48  juha_: you need something that understands javascript and validates it
14:48  compaq: timing, thanks for trying.  the things you said went by to fast, I have to read them over now
14:48  timing: haha okay
14:48  compaq: timing, don't bother repeating, I need to read what was already said

14:48  Poetro: :D
14:49  compaq: timing, thanks so much helping me on something so simple

15:16  dorgan: anyone?
15:16  ben_alman: jacksprat you can just link to the actual project page if you want, that would be great.

15:56  oodavid: something I've been itching to do for ages but don't really have the time
15:57  oodavid: the js is no problem, but not had a chance to look into plugin architecture
15:57  Itrace: mohi666: It's an AJAX loading type issue. I'm working with a third party script that slowly loads in. I can either run my click event as an onClick when the data is loaded or I need to wait for everything to load in and then add the click event. But the data is loaded in via Flash so it's not something I can easily detect.
15:57  alaing: is there a way to test to see if a plugin is available?
15:58  vysical: hello
15:58  vysical: can i set a change event handler to also fire when i "change" the element using jquery?
15:58  alaing: oodavid: I've played making plugins before

16:01  vysical: Brodingo: yeah i know that but i thought of doing it without additional coding. (that change just fires when attr value gets changed, doesn't matter how)
16:03  tktiddle: Does animate work with all css properties?
16:04  Brodingo: no tktiddle
16:04  Fratyr: hey guys. Is there any bugs with .delay(int) function? Can't make It work.
16:04  markj: ?paste @ Fratyr
16:04  bot-t: Fratyr, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
16:05  Brodingo: fratyr delay is for the animation queue, are you trying to delay something unrelated to animatioN?

16:08  webguy024: yeah  the way it is supposed to be
16:17  RobW: uh
16:17  RobW: why the fuck is IE not working with this:
16:17  RobW: $("form.select_form").live('submit', function() { var page = $(this).find("input[type=hidden][name=page]").val(); alert(page); });
16:18  Fratyr: Brodingo: Hm.. maybe you know If I can check somehow that doTimeout is currently running?
16:20  AjJi: [type=][name=] are not supported by IE6
16:20  AjJi: is it 6 or 7 ?
16:20  danheberden: AjJi: those css selectors (in your css that is) is not supported in ie6
16:20  AjJi: yep, that's what I meant to say
16:20  ryrych: hello, what are valid string values for animation speed? fast, slow and?
16:21  AjJi: normal ?
16:21  danheberden: but will work just fine in a jquery selectr
16:22  EtotheK: how i can get length to string in input?
16:22  ryrych: AjJi: seems obvious :D
16:22  RobW: ie8

16:24  a_l_e_x: hello anyone know a nice jquery-based graphing library, like WireIt for YUI?  (http://neyric.github.com/wireit/)
16:27  Aristata: Hey is there a way I can trigger an event to fire each time an elements height changes?
16:27  OhaiBBQ: trying to think of the name
16:27  mekwall: bot-t, tell doonie http://gyazo.com/aaedbf9ba371ffbb9085564d94d5c4ed.png
16:27  bot-t: mekwall, Okay.
16:27  OhaiBBQ: they mentioned it in some yayqueyr episode
16:28  oodavid: a_l_e_x: I have a few bookmarked, just a tick
16:28  oodavid: a_l_e_x: highcharts, protovis, emptrise, fusion, flot
16:29  a_l_e_x: oodavid, thanks - will check them out
16:29  oodavid: can't recall which is which library
16:29  OhaiBBQ: http://morrisonpitt.com/jsPlumb/html/jquery/demo.html like this, a_l_e_x?
16:29  Gate: Aristata: try $().resize
16:29  Gate: that might only work with the window though
16:30  a_l_e_x: OhaiBBQ: exactly
16:30  webguy024: is there a way to select elements with display:block?
16:31  timing: Aristata: how do the elements change height?
16:31  a_l_e_x: oodavid, those all look like charting libraries; i'm looking for directed graphs, workflows etc. - like yahoo pipes if ur familiar
16:31  danheberden: webguy024: i don't think so, you'd have to $(':visible').each and then check each one specifically
16:32  compaq: timing, I got it, hehe, I can't believe I couldn't see that, thanks
16:32  timing: compaq: a you rule !
16:32  webguy024: danheberden: yeah :visible doesn't select them, I'll just iterate and check all the display - only like 5 of them.. no biggie :)
16:32  oodavid: ah I'm with ya, fraid I've not really investigated that :S
16:32  ericnakagawa: Hi folks, have been scouring the web looking for a drop-in mobile Calender control for Jquery Mobile.
16:32  a_l_e_x: OhaiBBQ, wireit looks more complete for what i'm doing so i might have to take a deep breath and try YUI
16:38  StevenTyler:  how do you do a $('#id').prev('.selected') ?
16:39  erichynds: what do you expect that to do?
16:39  StevenTyler: wanna select the last object with class 'selected' from '#id'
16:40  erichynds: last? as in sibling? or ancestor?
16:41  StevenTyler: sibling
16:41  erichynds: try prevAll
16:42  StevenTyler: ok
16:43  daxroc: When you use toggleClass to change a class will an event bound to the new class assigned work ?
16:44  erichynds: daxroc, if it's bound with live or delegate
16:44  Aristata: timing I figured it out
16:44  Aristata: BUT
16:44  Aristata: In case this happens to someone else on here
16:45  daxroc: erichynds: it's just  $('.class').dblclick...
16:45  erichynds: daxroc, make that say $(".class").live("dblclick"...
16:46  Aristata: I have a little "featured product box" that needs to expand upward as content is added, otherwise it will flow over the footer. I had some js to change the bottom positioning based on the height. HOWEVER, I was using typekit to load my fonts, and if they did not load prior to the positioning, then the text would grow and the positioning would be screwed again.
16:46  Aristata: Luckily typekit has a callback for that.
16:46  flupke: is there a way to force "this" to be some object, in order to reuse event handlers in loops such as with .each() ?
16:46  Aristata: set it to a variable you can pass?
16:47  daxroc: erichynds: Much appreciate it, thanks
16:48  flupke: Aristata, you mean give my event handlers a signature like this: handler(event, this) ? I think it will break their normal usage as event handlers
16:49  flupke: or maybe I should do it the other way around and use small wrappers to call the event handlers logic
16:54  tesseracter: i usually use webdevout.net/test to set up examples, but im having trouble loading jquery there. ideas for places to setup test pages, or how to make jquery work on webdevout?
16:54  ablomen: tesseracter, its in the topic: http://jsfiddle.net
16:54  Brodingo: jsfiddle.net
16:55  tesseracter: excellent, thanks ablomen/ Brodingo
17:00  JAAulde: as near as I can tell, when jQuery is given a block of markup to append to the DOM, and that markup has script elements within, jQuery extracts the script elements from the markup prior to the append and adds them to the head. but it seems to remove them from the head right after it appends them.
17:00  JAAulde: is this correct? and if so, why is this done?
17:00  JAAulde: I have found it nearly impossible to debug/step code which was added to the DOM in this way
17:00  JAAulde: other than a bunch of console.log and alert statements

17:05  tesseracter: keeping in mind that there will be an ajax call that sets this stuff.
17:05  tcpsyn: Hello.
17:06  tcpsyn: I'm trying to open csv data in excel from within an ajax call with jquery.
17:06  tcpsyn: I can open the data like so:
17:06  tcpsyn: window.location='data:text/csv;charset=utf8,' + encodeURIComponent(data);
17:06  tcpsyn: within the success: callback of my query
17:06  tcpsyn: but I'm not sure how to set the appropriate mime type

17:13  Brodingo: yup
17:15 --- carter05 is now known as carter05_
17:16  bakers: Is the jquery test suite online somewhere? I.e. Can I run it from my browser?
17:17  Bjornet: Hi, have a prob with IE8, anyone surprised? I have this code (working fine in Safari and Firefox):
17:17  tesseracter: so... i've stumped people with my checkboxes, or it wasn't interesting enough. http://jsfiddle.net/JBQEj/2/ is the call being made twice when I hit the checkbox compared to hitting the yellow li?
17:17  Bjornet: http://jsfiddle.net/Nj3NR/
17:18  bakers: Bjornet: is that your whole test case? Where is the HTML?
17:18  tesseracter: Bjornet, most of my problems with IE8 have been because they deal with non-standard JS differently.
17:18  Bjornet: what might non standard be?
17:18  Bjornet: Ill paste some more.. one sec
17:19  Bjornet: What I want is just to fire off the submitButton
17:19  Bjornet: once someone selects an opition
17:19  bakers: Bjornet: why are you doing trigger('click') why not just .submit()
17:19  Bjornet: cuz I didnt get that to work..
17:19 --- carter05 is now known as carter05_
17:19  bakers: Bjornet: post some HTML as a test case and we can look deeper
17:19  Bjornet: ok
17:21  Bjornet: Its difficult to just extract it when it is connected to data from a database..
17:21  Bjornet: should I poste the actual site?
17:21  bakers: Bjornet: a simplified mockup is all we need
17:21  bakers: Bjornet: the less code the better
17:21  Bjornet: ok
17:22  timing: Bjornet: you can use jsfiddle for that
17:23  Bjornet: yes just cleaning first
17:24  Bjornet: http://jsfiddle.net/Nj3NR/2/
17:25  Bjornet: I think that is a clear example.
17:26  Bjornet: 1. Im new to web so Iv used a well tested php code here that generates <option> tags from a database. 2. Remember that this problem is IE(8) specific. works well in FF and Safari
17:30  Bjornet: And Opera
17:31  erichynds: Bjornet, bind to the change event of the select
17:31  erichynds: not click on the option tags
17:32  Bjornet: ah, what is that change event?
17:32  erichynds: ?change @ Bjornet
17:32  bot-t: Bjornet, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
17:32  Bjornet: sorry if that is not even a ? but I cannot realy follow..
