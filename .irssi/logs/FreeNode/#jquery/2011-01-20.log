08:41  doonie: hola mi amigo
08:42  Cork: soee: in ie7, and ie8 its a opacity bug
08:42  Cork: soee: ie6 shouldn't be able to get that to work at all
08:43  Cork: *its an opacity
08:43  soee: Cork: yeah i just found that info on msn
08:43  Cork: the only way to work around the bug is by using solid colors
08:43 --- rolux_ is now known as rolux
08:43  soee: yes but i need half transparent bg
08:43  Cork: or index transparancy in the png
08:44  Cork: ya, but opacity and alpha channel can't be combined in ie7 and 8
08:44  Cork: cause you get the black bug
08:45  xotix: hi
08:47  xotix: i've a textarea. i post the data wih $.post to a php script explode it there and print_r it back. then in the callback i put it into a div. since i have xml tags liek <> i get an empty array because the browser thinks it is html. so i thougth im adding pre tags to the .html(). but that doesnt work, cant i do it like that?
08:48  ss23: xotix: escape
08:48  ss23: xotix: Also, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24816/escaping-html-strings-with-jquery
08:51  xotix: uh thanks :)
08:51  ss23: escape() the function I meant btw
08:52  Cork: alternativly you can use <pre></pre>
08:52  ss23: But then if you ever have </pre> it messses stuff up too
08:55  xotix: i've delete the pre. thanks, got it now.
08:56  Cork: anyone ever had the problem where mouseleave is triggered on a chile element that extends outside its parent when the mouse moves out of the parent?

09:27  sahilsk: ...
09:30  Symbi0nt: sahilsk the mouseover event returns x and y coordinates I guess
09:31  Symbi0nt: with a little bit of math and some browser dimensions you can calculate verything you want
09:32  sahilsk: hmm
09:32  __machine: how can i remove outline for click to focus but retain it for tab to focus (keyboard users)?
09:35  carpet_the_walls: hi, can someone help me with this problem please, i am sure its quite simple, I have the following code https://gist.github.com/d3973666bfde8d0f955d, but when i call function foo with the validation function pointer, i would also like to pass in the string "foobar"
09:36  fRAiLtY-: Hi there,
09:37  fRAiLtY-: can anyone tell me why I get an Uncaught Exception when trying to post this? slonik helped me yesterday a lot but then went afk: http://codepad.org/xjUuVmoR
09:37  fRAiLtY-: I'm trying to post the folder name to be the value of the text input box
09:37  fRAiLtY-: so it creates the folder based and names it based on the input of the text box?
09:39  dirkpennings: guys, anyone knows about jquery mobile status? is the 1.0 still coming in January? can't find hard answers about this :)
09:43 --- danheberden is now known as danheberden|away
09:45  ablomen: carpet_the_walls, what is the problem? that code would work.. (except you running foo(validation) before both are defined)
09:46  carpet_the_walls: ablomen: it does work
09:46  carpet_the_walls: but i want the string "foobar" to be passed in to function foo
09:47  carpet_the_walls: along with the validation pointer
09:47  ablomen: well then do function foo (func, str) { func(str); }
09:50  carpet_the_walls: ablomen: oh, thanks!
09:52  fRAiLtY-: can anyone tell me why I get an Uncaught Exception when trying to post this? slonik helped me yesterday a lot but then went afk: http://codepad.org/xjUuVmoR
09:52  fRAiLtY-: It's the submit line that's causing the issue
09:52  Predominant: Hey, using jquery mobile testing in my browser, chrome, I get the following: "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin" when trying to change to a new page.
09:52  Predominant: I was wondering if someone could help me resolve this problem so I can separate out my pages
09:53  JKarsrud: it's a local site?
09:53  Predominant: Yes
09:53  JKarsrud: yeah, chrome isn't too happy about ajax requests on the local file system
09:53  Predominant: Any way around it?
09:53  Predominant: Its just jquery mobile
09:54  doonie: how does one track ajax req. in chrome tools, console didn't pick em up
09:54  ss23: doonie: Network tab
09:54  etcetera_: anyone kow of some good live demos of jquery mobile..?
09:54  JKarsrud: Predominant: add this to chromes startup script: --allow-file-access-from-files
09:54  etcetera_: I mean actual revenue generating products and such...
09:54  Predominant: JKarsrud: I don't think I can do that for things like iphone / android?
09:54  doonie: ow
09:54  doonie: i knew that ;P
09:54  doonie: thx ssssssssss
09:55  JKarsrud: no, but you wouldn't have your site locally on a phone now, would you?
09:55  JKarsrud: it's just because it's on the local file system
09:55  JKarsrud: do you can just upload it to a server to test it too
09:55  JKarsrud: so *
09:55  Predominant: JKarsrud: It will be local to the phone
09:55  eXistenZ: hi
09:56  JKarsrud: Predominant: and how would it be local for the phone?
09:56  eXistenZ: anyone know how to solve this error while trying to download from: http://jqueryui.com/download
09:56  eXistenZ: output file /srv/jqueryui.com/htdocs/repository/cache/0f252b053be416f5f18e9ebef7722c16/jquery-ui-1.8.8.custom.zip doesn't exist, redirecting to /download
09:56  Predominant: JKarsrud: In phonegap
09:56  JKarsrud: And I think it's chrome, not webkit
09:56  JKarsrud: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416
09:56  Predominant: Well, it just sits there doing nothing on webkit too
09:57  eXistenZ: never mind.. .deselect and select some will solve
09:58  JKarsrud: Predominant: ok. Well, I haven't seen anyone complaining about it on phonegap before, so I guess they've done some shit to fix it :)
09:58  JKarsrud: You'll have to try tbh
09:58  Predominant: I'll have to try.
09:58  Predominant: not very helpful.
09:58  Predominant: Thanks anyway
09:58  JKarsrud: But for testing on your computer, just upload it to a server I guess
09:59  JKarsrud: Predominant: I've never worked with phonegap and jquery mobile before, so I don't know enough about it
10:00  Predominant: Its not a phonegap issue.
10:00  Predominant: The issue is the local ajax
10:00  Predominant: Solve that, and I solve the problem.
10:00  Predominant: Surely there is a way around not being able to use local files.
10:00  etcetera_: anyone on jquery mobile demos?
10:01  JKarsrud: yes, I posted it to you, Predominant
10:02  Predominant: Posted what to me?
10:02  JKarsrud: but that only works in chrome I think

10:28  felisse: i have a keyevent on my website to load more content by reaching the end of a screen. this of course happens via $.ajax
10:29  felisse: it happens that the ajax call is fired more than once by hitting a key very fast
10:30  felisse: is there any way to block a call, if the same call (means the same request url) already running ??
10:30  dinosaadeh: hi guys, is there a jquery carousel that scrolls following the mouse (right: scroll to right, left: scroll to left)
10:31  markj2: ?debounce @ felisse
10:31  bot-t: felisse, debounce | jQuery Plugins - jQuery throttle / debounce allows you to rate-limit your functions in multiple useful ways. Passing a delay and callback to $.throttle returns a new function that will execute no more than once eve... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/debounce

10:42  Raymond: hi, every one.
10:43  clarkfischer: hi, Raymond
10:43  Raymond: can anyone advise me if I can move to the next element by press enter, instead of tab, by jQuery?
10:52  coldhead: everyone doing good?
10:53  Raymond: yeah, except for not getting answer yet on my question.
10:53 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
10:54  coldhead: ah okay i just saw your q.
10:54  coldhead: it's an interesting one
10:54  clarkfischer: Raymond: You'll need to bind to a keypress/down/up event, check to see if it's the enter key, prevent default behavior, then focus the next field
10:54  coldhead: let me experiment
10:55  Raymond: thank you
10:56  clarkfischer: $('input').keypress(function (event) { if ( e.keyCode == 13 ) { event.preventDefault(). this.next('input').focus(); } })
10:56  fRAiLtY-: can anyone tell me why I get an Uncaught Exception when trying to post this? slonik helped me yesterday a lot but then went afk: http://codepad.org/xjUuVmoR
10:57  Raymond: thanks clarkfischer. I will try with your valuable code. :D
10:57  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: What kind of uncaught exception?
10:57  clarkfischer: Raymond: You're quite welcome
10:58  fRAiLtY-: That's all firefox tells me :( I'm trying to pass the contents of the input box called "orderID" to create the folder in the scriptdata, but it doesn't even submit. slonik told me to add the uploadify.Settings bit to the submit and since then its' not worked
10:59  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: Can you post the code that PHP spits out?
11:01  coldhead: Raymond: i had to make a few mods to clarkfischer's excellent suggestion: http://jsfiddle.net/wXkJy/
11:01  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: http://codepad.org/qUK9xG74 - that's the code for the uploadify.php the file that creates the folder
11:01  fRAiLtY-: I want it to create the folder but call it the contents of the input box
11:01  fRAiLtY-: in the form
11:02  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: Does firefox give you a line number? Any sort of debugging information? Do you have firebug installed?
11:02  fRAiLtY-: I have firebug yes
11:02  Nailor: Do I need to attach the elements in to DOM for the find etc to work?
11:03  coldhead: Nailor: no
11:03  Nailor: I hmm. Wonder then why that's not working.
11:03  coldhead: ?eval $('<div><a href="lol">foo</a></div>').find('a').attr('href')
11:03  Nailor: I have jquery object containing a div, that gets stuff added in to it by evently (a framework). When I try to .find stuff in the div, it just does not work
11:03  bot-t: coldhead: TypeError: div is undefined
11:04  coldhead: NO U, bot-t
11:04  coldhead: ?p @ Nailor
11:04  bot-t: Nailor, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
11:06  Nailor: The problem is that the current code has a load of moving parts and pasting it there would not probably help at all (it's a couchapp that relies on evently, the code that is not working is a jasmine test :p)
11:07  dinosaadeh: hi guys, is there a jquery carousel that scrolls following the mouse (right: scroll to right, left: scroll to left)
11:07  Nailor: So I probably have to keep on digging the problem myself. Just wanted to know that the .find is not DOM-bind
11:08  HardPhuck: how can i test an element if it's the last sibling?
11:08  clarkfischer: Nailor: Can you serialize the dom at the point you're trying to troubleshoot? $('#myDiv').html()
11:08  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: Sorry, it's uploading now I must have made a change yesterday, that code I pasted is up to date, it's uploading the files but NOT creating a folder :(((
11:09  VictorCL: on $ajax->form the indicator will hide the #id if there is an error aswell?
11:09  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: This is a problem with the uploadify script?

11:09  coldhead: Nailor: http://jsfiddle.net/xvC6D/
11:09  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: This is my PHP error in error_log: [20-Jan-2011 11:04:48] PHP Warning:  mkdir() [<a href='function.mkdir'>function.mkdir</a>]: File exists in /home/demo/public_html/upload/ext/uploadify.php on line 38
11:09  fRAiLtY-: This is the same .php file I have working elsewhere on the site, I just duplicated it to start a new project
11:10  coldhead: what can that error possibly be trying to say :D
11:10  coldhead: IT'S LIKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE
11:10  ss23: coldhead is a noob
11:10 * ss23 runs away
11:10  alphaG:  hi, if i have a table which, each row (TR) tag has an ID, and i want to use the DOM to delete the row by its ID, how do i do that? (on ALL browsers), i've tried using: var i=document.getElementById('something'+idNo); i.parentNode.removeChild(i); , and also Jquery's $('something'+ idNo).remove(); . Without a success.
11:10  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: It looks like it's trying to call mkdir on an existing directory. Perhaps try an if (file_exists($newDir)) ?
11:11  Nailor: clarkfischer: Odd. The .html does not return a thing, but if I just console.log the variable containing my element, it looks ok
11:11  coldhead: ss23: if i had ops i would kick you so hard
11:11  ss23: :O
11:11  coldhead: i wouldn't really
11:11  ss23: One might take that for sexual abuse coldhead
11:11  clarkfischer: Nailor: .html or .html()?
11:11  coldhead: i don't know how
11:12  Nailor: clarkfischer: .html()
11:12  ss23: All this talk of "hard" and putting your feet near me
11:12  coldhead: it's my first day using irc
11:12  Nailor: clarkfischer: I have a code like: console.log(div); console.log(div.html());. Latter does not print a thing, the first one does
11:12  ss23: coldhead: Type "/server set vhost color on" to turn on colored hosts!
11:12  Kasreyn: coldhead: welcome. you missed the party. it started about 20 years ago :)
11:13  Nailor: Maybe I need to dig in to the evently source to see if it's breaking my object.
11:13  clarkfischer: Nailor: is div a jquery object? try div.innerHTML
11:13  clarkfischer: console.log(div.innerHTML)
11:13  Nailor: clarkfischer: It's created with $('<div>');, after that an evently app is connected to it.
11:14  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: http://codepad.org/DCFajTVA - line 17 is the folder specification
11:14  Nailor: clarkfischer: That basically tells what happens: http://jsfiddle.net/aBYhh/
11:14  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: This should work?
11:15  Nailor: clarkfischer: and innerHTML returns undefined
11:15  clarkfischer: fRAiLtY-: does /files/ exist?
11:16  fRAiLtY-: yes, it holds lots of other files in folders of unique names, I want to place these files in folders that are subdirectories of /files/
11:17  clarkfischer: Nailor: What does div.length return?
11:17  Nailor: 1
11:18  Nailor: clarkfischer: which is odd, as the console.log(div) presents me with an dom object containing all sub-divs added by evently.
11:18  Nailor: But I bet there's something fishy in the evently.
11:19  clarkfischer: Nailor: Is div.find('*') returning all the children?
11:19  fRAiLtY-: clarkfischer: yes, it holds lots of other files in folders of unique names, I want to place these files in folders that are subdirectories of /files/

11:19  Nailor: clarkfischer: Nope
11:20  Nailor: clarkfischer: it returns an empty array

11:22  aidan: I'm so in love with themeroller ... being able to prefix the theme so I can use three themes on a single page = amazing.
11:22  clarkfischer: Nailor: Hrm... And you're using an unmodified version of jQuery?
11:22  Nailor: clarkfischer: Hah. Nailed it! Seems that for some reason the all rendering stuff takes too long
11:23  clarkfischer: Oh, that makes sense.
11:23  Nailor: clarkfischer: So I just need to add some sort of busyloop there to wait for the stuff to actually appear inside the div
11:23  clarkfischer: Uh...
11:23  clarkfischer: A blocking busyloop isn't a great idea.
11:23  Nailor: clarkfischer: Well acutally jasmine provides a wait-method to do that :p
11:23  clarkfischer: Evently doesn't trigger some sort of event once it's done doing its thing?
11:23  Nailor: clarkfischer: but anyway, thanks for help
11:23  Nailor: clarkfischer: Apparently not
11:23  Nailor: At least by looking at the source I'm not figuring out if it does
11:24  sdgfh: Hi, i have some questions regarding multiple autocomplete fields on the same page - that I couldn't find the answers for from the manual.
11:27  sdgfh: I know it's possible to use class names to get more than one autocomplete field, but the handling code for selecting a suggestion is " document.getElementById('cust_id').value = ui.item.id;" and I'm not sure how to deal with this for multiple input boxes.  Is there some OOP obj that refers to the input in question?
11:27  sdgfh: So I won't have to use ID names for updating the input value?
11:29  clarkfischer: sdgfh: You're using jQuery UI's autocomplete?
11:29  sdgfh: yeah
11:31  clarkfischer: sdgfh: I don't think you should have any trouble.
11:31  clarkfischer: just call the .autocomplete method on each of your autocomplete boxes, and configure the options.
11:31 --- rolux_ is now known as rolux
11:32  clarkfischer: Some of the options have callbacks that will hand you their own ui instance, so you don't have to worry about what's what.
11:33  silv3r_m00n: hi there
11:33  sdgfh: I forgot to give you one bit of crucial info...The point of using the "select" event is so that I can set another hidden input with the DB id of the selected sugegstion.   but I load the input's dynamiclly...  is there a way of knowing the "active" input fields ID when binding it through class name?
11:33 --- JoshManders_ is now known as JoshManders
11:33  silv3r_m00n: I am using jquery ui autocomplete and calling it twice ,  but the in the second time the data it in stays same as before , is it supposed to happen like that ?
11:34  clarkfischer: sdgfh: Presumably $(this).attr('id')
11:34  clarkfischer: Depends what context jquery ui uses
11:34  clarkfischer: I'd imagine it would use the input field
11:34  dirkpennings: Anyone knows about the 1.0 jQuery mobile "roadmap"? is 1.0 still coming this January? can't find any recent updates on this..
11:34  sdgfh: clarkfischer: thx I'll try that.. i'm a real noob when it comes to JS but common sense has brought me a long way ;-)
11:35  clarkfischer: sdgfh: Well, if you've made it this far, you're doing well.
11:36  sdgfh: clarkfischer: it's all thanks to jquery.. such a delight to work with... i can just forget about learning JS and get it all done anyway, heheh ;)
11:36  Superman_: ..
11:36  Kasreyn: aidan: what do you mean by prefix the themes?
11:36  clarkfischer: That's exactly the idea.
11:38  aidan: Kasreyn: you can prefix the themes when you download them, name space
11:38  sdgfh: clarkfischer: forgot to ask you, but I'm also usign a completly seperate autocomplete to another db table and that is fixed to just one input ID (not class)... when several autocomplete uses the same PHP to handle the event, can I specify some extra GET var for it so send along with the request?  just to seperate them in the PHP?
11:38  Kasreyn: aidan: ok so the UI webpage generates tags for you that you can then use in different parts of your html ?
11:40  Rails3: question: I just created some forms with wufoo for my site: http://www.moneyTMS.com - and I don't like the branding, or not having full control of the data. Can anyone reccomend a good form solution that will look polished like wufoo? I am good with html/css and PHP - but my jQuery is lacking. Or even a workaround to remove wufoo's branding
11:40  clarkfischer: sdgfh: I don't see why not.
11:40  sdgfh: clarkfischer:  maybe i should just check if   "source: "index.php?auto_no=1"   is valid syntax? ;)
11:41  clarkfischer: If they're all in the same <form> it shouldn't be hard.
11:41  Kasreyn: aidan: ok found it now. under "Advanced Theme Settings" right?
11:41  clarkfischer: sdgfh: Close. Literal syntax dictates: `source: "index.php?auto_no=1"` OR `'source': "index.php?auto_no=1"`
11:41  Kasreyn: "CSS Scope" is the namespace ?
11:41  clarkfischer: Without the `s
11:42  sdgfh: they are, but the problem is determining which db tabel to get the results from in the PHP, all autocomplete uses the same $_GET['term']
11:42  clarkfischer: sdgfh: Change the name attribute on the <input> field?
11:42  clarkfischer: Or, the name attribute on the hidden field
11:43  clarkfischer: The autocomplete has little to do with the form submission/data handling
11:43  sdgfh: thats not where it's defined, it's internal jQuery names for the request
11:44  makin: Hi i have a performance problem. I have this code implemented: http://pastebin.com/v8wYcLcn This script it's too slow because the return array it's very big. How i can improve this script? Thank you in advance.
11:44  sdgfh: clarkfischer: when specifying an autocomplete to the input xxx jQuery still sends the request to the PHP code as ?term=partly_inputed_text
11:45  sdgfh: no relation to my own input ID's
11:45  aidan: Kasreyn: right,
11:45  gnarf: are there any free css3 compatible font repos?

11:46  tozerwin: hi, does anyone knows where i can find a recent offline version of api.jquery.com thx
11:48  sdgfh: clarkfischer: i use POST, but i think you'r misunderstanding me... when jQuery is requesting JSON results from my PHP (before any form is submitted) it uses the GET var "term" on top of the PHP filename I specify... I guess it's not much of a problem, just have to make another PHP to handle it when it's a diffrent autocomplete tabel that needs querying, but still... I'd liek to use the same PHP for both, and to do that I need to be abl

12:13  felisse: when loading content into your page via ajax, the new content is "untouched" html. thats why you have to ecexute any necessary javascript after you placed the new content in your page. but when the new content even comes from your own page, it happens, that elements, that already are on your page before the ajax call, get also effected by the javascript, which is executed after the ajax call,
12:13  felisse: actually only meant to hit the new content.
12:13  felisse: is there any way to execute javascript on the ajax response object before putting it into your page? e.g. you get an xmlResponseText and transform it via $(xmlResponseText) into DOM structure. is it possible to execute javascript on that jquery object?
12:15  Aamir: felisse: ajax success method?
12:15  Aamir: gym_jane: i sent u few emails. i hope u got those

12:19  pashmi: hi there, i am using JQ dropndown select list. when the list of item gets bigger it shows scrollbar at the right handside which is good. however, mostly in ie i am unable to scroll down the list with scroll bar. clicking on scroll bar closes the list. has any body got experience in that?
12:19  gym_jane: right, i need to learn abit abt jsonp
12:19  gym_jane: brb
12:20  Aamir: gym_jane:  in simple words, jsonp is json wrapped in a function which will be called soon u get a response from a server
12:21  Aamir: gym_jane: u send the name of the function to server - server generate the json and wrap it in the function u gave it. so you should have that function in ur code which will be called soon the response arrive from server
12:21  gym_jane: well what would have is some links i.e <a href="http://www.domain.com/page.html">Some interesting page</a>inside an XML file hosted on google appspot along with jquery files etc
12:22  gym_jane: then I want an embedable code that anyone can put on their site

14:23  pashmi: hi, I am usung jquery dropdown/selectbox. when the list get long, there is scrollbar at inside the list, but does not work, trying to scroll the list with it cause closing the list. it same for all browsers except FF
14:25  sdgfh: blackspotwiggins: hmm, does splice work the same way in all browsers?  using it like this page says: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp   which claims that 2 params are required, but splice(0,8) returns only the FIRST 8, not everything after as i want.... splice(8) - only - works, but wrong syntax ?  if 2 params are a requirement? :S
14:26  blackspotwiggins: meh
14:26  sdgfh: meh? :P
14:26  blackspotwiggins: 1) w3schools sucks

14:26 --- LayneObserdia is now known as LayneObserdia|aw
14:27  blackspotwiggins: .splice(0,8) works the same across everything
14:27  sdgfh: heh, i figured, but still... they shouldn't make such obvious mistakes as claiming a method requires arguments when it doesn't :S
14:27  blackspotwiggins: you shouldn't make the obvious mistake and use w3schools
14:27  sdgfh: lol
14:27  sdgfh: i blame google O.o

14:33  ClearCarbon: $('#Sortable li'), I want to test if that selector returns no results would that be if(('#Sortable li') == null) ?
14:35  erichynds: ClearCarbon, test if .length === 0
14:36  LekisS: ndee: try removing the "javascript:" since the onclick is implying it... The "javascript:" would be useful if it would be in the href for example
14:36  erichynds: ?inline @ ndee
14:36  bot-t: ndee, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.

14:49  erichynds: $(this).closest('tr')[0].tagName
14:50  ace_me: I was there without [0] ... so why is a collection ?
14:50  erichynds: you have to take the elem out of the jquery object to call tagName on it
14:50  erichynds: otherwise you are calling tagname on a jq object, which doesn't have that property
14:50  erichynds: you want the actual DOM node

15:44  xotix: i've made this, http://pastebin.com/Tv1AXHne but i doesnt rly like it. hwo can i do that better?
15:44  keglevich: blackspot: I can post the code somewhere if you want
15:45  blackspotwiggins: sure, do that
15:46  keglevich: blackspot: http://www.pastie.org/1480915
15:47  Hopsy: shiawuen: hmm, i am not useing swfobject
15:47  Aamir: xotix: you are using inline javascript and inline css :|
15:48  xotix: i've copied from jquery so?
15:48  Hopsy: shiawuen: http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showpost.php3?s=a44317471e627ff4acd6113a98753614&p=484889&postcount=2
15:48  blackspotwiggins: keglevich, i _think_ you can nest accordions
15:48  Hopsy: the tip :o
15:48  blackspotwiggins: but im not sure
15:48  Hopsy: "Note: Z-index only works on elements that have been positioned (eg position:absolute!"
15:48  Aamir: xotix:  keep them separate
15:48  xotix: Aamir whats the inline js?
15:49  blackspotwiggins: right now you only setting it on the first level
15:49  keglevich: blackspot: yeah I know...I can give you FTP access if you are kind enough to test that
15:49  Aamir: xotix: onclick="urlInput()"
15:49  rjgoldsborough: hey all. I have a jquery ajax function and on success I want a confirm modal to pop up. I have it working with an alert, but for some reason my function won't work. http://pastebin.com/TNcpYY4n any ideas?
15:49  blackspotwiggins: keglevich, i dont really want to do that
15:49  Aamir: xotix:  use  $('#navUrlInput').click(function(){ .. })
15:49  xotix: Aamir? and? whats wrong with that?
15:50  keglevich: blackspot: you know for someone who could help maybe?
15:50  xotix: why?
15:50  Aamir: keep js separate from ur html
15:50  Aamir: and keep css out of js
15:50  Aamir: xotix: ^
15:50  iaj: erichynds: hmmm I tried.. its actually setting the value of the second selectbox to '' instead of the correct place (same as in the selectbox above - but another value ;)
15:51  blackspotwiggins: keglevich, i dont know if anyone here would really enjoy doing your work
15:51  iaj: (should be same as in .. ) i mean
15:51  Aamir: xotix: google for "avoid inline javascript"
15:51  keglevich: blackspot: as I said...I am willing to donate if needed
15:51  blackspotwiggins: keglevich, thats not really the place for that
15:51  blackspotwiggins: if you want to get help on jquery related questions, sure
15:51  shiawuen: z-index works for HTML elements, but not for plugin like Flash
15:51  blackspotwiggins: if you are looking to hire someone, there are sites for that
15:51  xotix: Aamir, why is the onclick wrong? whats wrong with that? and why shouldi do that stuff with css? its just backgroudn changing...
15:51  shiawuen: also here is the reason behind http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15523.html
15:52  blackspotwiggins: keglevich, look at mechanical turk for example
15:52  Aamir: shiawuen:  facebook do such stuff... dialogs on the top of flash
15:52  shiawuen: and you just need to set wmode="opaque" to your <embed />
15:52  keglevich: blackspot: basically I think there's only a small modification needed, so for someone with good jquery knowledge adding that second level accordion shouldn't be that huge problem
15:52  keglevich: however, thank for your time
15:53  shiawuen: you need to tell Flash to act nicely to other elements by setting the wmode
15:53  Aamir: xotix:  keep ur css in .css files, ur javascript in .js files and html in .html or .whatever
15:54  xotix: why? i've my css out. but JS i dont. and i dont knwo why. tell me why. whats wrong about js in a html.
15:54  keglevich: blackspot: is this maybe something what could help? http://www.explorejquery.com/assets/images/uploads/jquery_Multi_level_Accordion/jquery_Multi_level_Accordion.html
15:54  blackspotwiggins: yeah
15:54  blackspotwiggins: sure
15:54  keglevich: this is something as you said...nested accordion
15:54  Mafia: hi
15:54  keglevich: I'll try to put something together
15:55  Mafia: I am looking for a nice image anotation script, anyone does know where to find a nice one? The ones google returns are not very usefull
15:56  erichynds: ?inline @ xotix
15:56  bot-t: xotix, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
15:56  fr34k: is there any function to cut a string? var=thisismytext; and i want var=thisismy

15:58  abracsi: is there a way to display model forms in jquery?
15:58  norbi: guys, nothing about slideToggle()?
15:59  iaj: you gave me the code for selecting a selectbox entry based on the selection from another select box  $("#select1").change(function(){ $("#select2").val( this.value ); });   however this one sets my second selectbox to nothing :(   you could check for yourself @ http://verimatic.com/index.php?id=62
15:59  xotix: still, is there a better way to do what im doing in the js? doesnt matter if its outsoruced yet or not. pls thanks
16:00  blackspotwiggins: xotix, you were jut told that dont use inline js, thats a start
16:00  blackspotwiggins: just*
16:00  norbi: iaj: the code is fine
16:01  abracsi: modal pop overs, am i going mad, i swear jquery has something like this?
16:01  Kasreyn: is IE retarded? i can load a css from external with link but not a local one?
16:01  erichynds: iaj what does "this.value" return?  is there an option in the second select with the same value?
16:02  blackspotwiggins: IE is retarded
16:02  norbi: eichynds: it can have the same values
16:02  norbi: 1,2,3 or
16:02  norbi: GER, IT
16:02  norbi: etc
16:02  norbi: to have the same value
16:02  norbi: and it will be just fine in php to process it
16:02  dirkpennings: Anyone knows about the 1.0 jQuery mobile "roadmap"? is 1.0 still coming this January? can't find any recent updates on this..
16:02  norbi: but iaj can work with indexes too
16:02  iaj: erichynds: no completely different selectbox
16:03  iaj: erichynds: it shall just use the same selectbox selection position-wise
16:03  Kasreyn: IE doesn't understand $("head").append(cssLink); if cssLink is local..
16:03  abracsi: does jquery have a method for displaying overlay content? (akin to alerts)
16:03  norbi: index from select one to change the value of the other select to the same index
16:04  wdimiceli: does jquery automatically strip inline script tags when using .append()?
16:04  wdimiceli: where the new html was retrieved via ajax
16:04  erichynds: iaj, this is working for me: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/AJzC2/
16:04  abracsi: ahha, found it!! it's Dialog in jquery UI
16:05  erichynds: iaj, if you want them competely in sync do http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/AJzC2/1/
16:08  norbi: var index; $("#select1").change(function(){ index=$(this).index("#select1 option:selected"); $('#select2')[index].attr('selected', 'selected');
16:08  norbi:   });
16:08  norbi: iaj: try this
16:09  norbi: iaj: the first solution was good in case you have the same values
16:09  norbi: but if you don't want to mess with php forms
16:09  norbi: to change the values
16:09  norbi: and etc
16:09  norbi: processing data
16:09  norbi: then you should try that i given you
16:09  serio: is there like, an unwritten rule as to how much data should be transfered when making ajax calls?
16:10  norbi: serio: i think no. you can make a preload animation and wait until data will be processed
16:10  norbi: but
16:10  norbi: you ave limitation from the server
16:10  jaql: i have a page that is initially missing the main content.  to get the content, you enter information into a form field and it does an ajax request to load all of the information.  when the information is loaded there javascript that's supposed to be applied to some of the elements from the ajax request, but this is not happening.  the js does not load until the page is refreshed (because the form information is stored in a cookie).
16:10  norbi: php execution time
16:10  jaql: how would i work around this?
16:10  norbi: is your php script exceeds that
16:12  norbi: jaql: your script dunno about the element loaded after the script was loaded
16:12  norbi: so you need a callback
16:12 --- 15SABEIS4 is now known as chevelle
16:12 --- chevelle is now known as chevelle102
16:12 --- chevelle102 is now known as chevelle
16:12  norbi: for example make a function
16:12  Bigsista: jaql: when/where is the modify-function called?
16:13  norbi: like function dotheelementthing(){ here comes you operation with loaded elements } then on the success method of the ajax you call the function
16:13  norbi: then it will know that you have the elements
16:13  jaql: when the whole page is first loaded, which, if the user did not enter a the information into the form, is initially missing the main content
16:13  jaql: Bigsista: ^
16:13  norbi: because you've called the function after the elements was loaded
16:14  norbi: jai: works now?
16:14  xotix: http://pastebin.com/VyqGiA4E whats wrong?
16:14  Bigsista: jaql: put your function in success: or complete:
16:15  jaql: yeah, i just have to figure out how.  the ajax request is being done by drupal.
16:17  norbi: xotix: whats wrong with what?
16:18  norbi: what do you expect?
16:18  Bigsista: jaql: did you write the template, ajax request?
16:18  jaql: Bigsista: not this one.
16:18  norbi: Bigsista: i don't think so :)
16:18  xotix: the alert.
16:18  norbi: the alert?
16:18  xotix: when clicking on the first li
16:18  Bigsista: norbi: heh...  =)
16:19  norbi: xotix: pastebin the real code
16:19  norbi: not this ...
16:19  jaql: Bigsista: i have a few i did, but the form one is an option in views
16:19  norbi: jaql: give a link to us
16:19  jaql: norbi: i resent you're last comment if that was directed towards me ;p
16:19  xotix: this is everything. an li, you click the li. the click() gives me an alert. thats all i want.
16:19  jaql: norbi: and i don't have a link to show you.
16:20  jaql: norbi: i understand how i can fix it, i just have to figure out how to modify the request drupal makes.
16:21  Bigsista: jaql: of add some stuff to the end of the loaded data...
16:21  norbi: jaql: give us then a link of online example with that
16:21  Bigsista: of = or
16:21  JohnnyL: anyone know of a very good eample of Drag And Drop using jQuery UI? (like images, text boxes, text, etc etc)
16:21  norbi: Bigsista: yes, he could add a javascript to the end of the file, but that is xss :P
16:22  xotix: norbi, its just about the click. it worked with onclick but since onclick is bad i tried it with the click. there is no other code.
16:22  Bigsista: norbi: that's ending headaches sometimes
16:22  jaql: norbi: i don't have a link of an online example with my exact problem, nor do i have the time to search the web for an example at the moment.  you seem to understand what i am having a problem with anyway, and have already suggested a solution.
16:22  norbi: xotix: give the code
16:22  norbi: xotix: that code has html
16:23  norbi: and there is no <script></script> so dunno what it has before it
16:23  norbi: or after
16:23  norbi: jaql: probably if it is done by drupal then you have an example at drupal demo
16:23  norbi: ?
16:23  Bigsista: question: i have a $("#submit-1080129276").bind("click", function (event) {$.ajax({beforeSend:function (XMLHttpRequest) ( HERE I NEED HELP ...
16:23  Bigsista: is it valid to add a function here, that checks my form
16:24  Bigsista: AND how do i cancel the bind('click'... from breForesend
16:24  norbi: you mean {$.ajax({beforeSend:function (XMLHttpRequest){
16:24  Bigsista: jap
16:24  jaql: is that my question with pseudo code?
16:24  Bigsista: i can cancel the ajax reqeust w/ return false; but not the submit
16:25  norbi: yes you can
16:25  Kasreyn: IE is retarded: if ($.browser.msie) { $(cssLink).clone().appendTo('head');}
16:25  norbi: i mean if you call a function..
16:26  Kasreyn: if you don't clone and append to head it refuses to redraw with new css
16:26  xotix: http://pastebin.com/419m4j4p
16:26  Bigsista: norbi: return false in a function called in beforeSend only cancels the ajax request as far as i see it im myconsole
16:27  norbi: Bigsista: and you want to cancel the handler?
16:27  tsyrak: hi
16:27  tsyrak: how can i cancel a picture being dragged?
16:28  tsyrak: i have a draggable but in some circumstances i'd like to cancel the drop
16:28  tsyrak: sorry i do mean cancelling a picture being dropped (not dragged)
16:28  norbi: tsyrak: you have to make the if statement before you enable the drag
16:28  norbi: or you have drag pause or cancel method
16:28  Bigsista: norbi: what happens, when i return false; in beforeSend is, that the req is cancelled. but then for some strange reason the form get submitted via conventional POST
16:28  norbi: you need to define the condition when it should not allow it to be draggable
16:29  norbi: ahh
16:29  xotix: norbi http://pastebin.com/419m4j4p why does the click() not work?
16:29  norbi: Bigsista: form.submit()
16:29  norbi: you have to cancel submiting
16:29  norbi: #submit is a submit button
16:29  Bigsista: right
16:29  norbi: then you have to disable submiting the form by javascript
16:30  anli_: Is there a reason why $('<input type="checkbox" checked/>') generates a radiobutton on a certain linux box (using ff)?
16:30  tsyrak: norbi: you mean i have to play on the draggable properties, i CANOOT cancel a drop?
16:31  norbi: tsyrak: you can cancel the drop, but you've said that you want to disable the drag
16:31  Bigsista: ok. so a $('form').bind('submit', function(event ... event.preventDefault(); ... might do?
16:31  norbi: not the drop
16:31  norbi: Bigsista: yes, i think so
16:31  tsyrak: yes sorry i do mean the drop
16:32  norbi: tsyrak: jquery ui riht?
16:32  tsyrak: norbi: yes
16:33  norbi: tsyrak: look, this is a solution just of many:
16:33  Vaerros: anli_, what's the exact code for that insertion?
16:33  norbi: you have to set the accept method of the dropable
16:33  norbi: accept: "#thiswillbeaccepted"
16:33  norbi: and any other element or image that doesn't have that class will be not accepted
16:34  norbi: so you need to add the class to those images that you want to be accepted and remove it from those you don;t
16:34  tsyrak: oohhh
16:34  tsyrak: sweet
16:34  norbi: Bisista: does it work?
16:34  cburgdorf: Can anybody tell me if its fine to nest tests in qunit? It works and fulfills my goals but I wonder if thats something undocumented that might break in the future or if its fine to do so...

16:37  dunkel2: hey vladikoff sup
16:38  anli_: Vaerros: Its a lot of code, I have minimized it however, its on http://nopaste.info/b1196fba7b.html
16:38  anli_: That code generates a radiobutton on one box
16:38  anli_: using linux and ff
16:38  anli_: On other boxes, you get a checkbox as you should
16:39  norbi: xotix
16:39  norbi: :)
16:39  anli_: Is the "checked" attribute break things?
16:39  anli_: breaking
16:41  cataclysm: hi all. can someone take a reeally quick look at what i setup in my code and let me know if anything is wrong? jquery is included and the code is built right, im just not getting it to work: http://pastie.org/private/l83srs2cmguimhsqfjbew
16:41  norbi: anli_: what happens?
16:41  Vaerros: anli_, well, you could try checked='checked'
16:41  Vaerros: anli_, works for me though(firefox 3.6.13)
16:42  norbi: me to
16:42  norbi: me too
16:43  xotix: but still. i have 3 lis, each one got the same color. now i want to change the active one. i dont have a link in it jsut a plain li. at the moment i do add .css the color. in all, i need9 lines for that, each li 3. how can i do that better? doesnt look quite nice. same code.
16:43  cataclysm: ive included jquery. ive created the <script> code for autocomplete that points to an ID of a textbox on the form. what could have gone wrong?
16:45  Bigsista: norbi: finally understood it, i think.
16:46  cataclysm: oops got disconnected
16:46  Shishire: ok, I need to run a block of code every time an element with a certain class is inserted into the DOM... Other than polling, which is less than ideal, I'm stumped.  Is there some kind of DOM Insertion event that's well supported? http://jsfiddle.net/fWnDV/
16:46  cataclysm: after looking at it, it says $(#business").autocomplete is not a function
16:46  Bigsista: with return (validateFrom()); it seems to work. validateForm() returns true of false
16:46  cataclysm: does that mean that i have  JS configured wrong on xampp?
16:47  timmywil: cataclysm: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8
16:47  akheron: Shishire: I'm afraid you need to do polling
16:47  norbi: cataclysm: you don't have the autocomplete function defined
16:47  cataclysm: norbi err what's that mean. i followed the demo
16:48  Shishire: akheron, damn.  I was hoping there was something clever.  Thanks.
16:48  timmywil: cataclysm: fourth point of that slide
16:48  akheron: Shishire: at least with changed attributes you have to, I'm not exactly sure about added elements
16:49  timmywil: cataclysm: autocomplete requires jquery ui core as well, make sure that is included
16:49  norbi: cataclysm: it means that you have to use this instead of 1.7.1 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.8/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
16:50  akheron: Shishire: Also, I wouldn't be suprised if there already was a plugin to do the polling for you, if polling is needed
16:50  Shishire: akheron, yeah, I saw a watch plugin, I just don't like the idea of having to poll, kinda goes against the core idea for the system I'm working on.

17:11  timmywil: the default type is GET for ajax requests, it is an option you can set  type: "post"
17:12  osmosis_paul: but form example in the code that i pasted it is an ajax request?
17:12  timmywil: $.post obviously sets that for you
17:12  norbi: timmywill: so guys, here is the solution for the bug of the slideToggle if you meet the same problem
17:12  timmywil: yes, $.post is just a shortcut for $.ajax
17:12  norbi: you have to add the overflow: hidden to the element that is toggled

17:22  tsyrak: cause i have set the method to always return false;
17:22  tsyrak: http://www.visionboard.me/concept/#
17:22  tsyrak: and if you keep trying the images finally drop into the canvas
17:23  tsyrak: actually it still does not accept it
17:23  tsyrak: it's just that the picture does not revert to its original location properly
17:24  dpy: Okay, what use is there to be able to programmatically trigger a mousemove   (elQ.mousemove() or elQ.trigger('mousemove'))  *without* being able to specify *where* (read: x,y) you want the move to supposedly be triggered...
17:26  ajpiano: dpy: you can specify where
17:26  ajpiano: for instance
17:27  ajpiano: $("foo").trigger({type:"mousemove",clientX:40,clientY:90})
17:27  ajpiano: justinbmeyer, i don't know, but i am pretty sure you would have more luck with that question in #jquery-dev :)

19:42  coachz: they havent 'rewritten' whatever crap apps they have that require 6 yet ?
19:42  necromancer: it's not that
19:42  necromancer: in a company that has 3,000 machines, for example
19:42  necromancer: and 5,000 people working for it
19:43  necromancer: they have to pay their IT staff to upgrade every single one
19:43  necromancer: which costs them money
19:43  coachz: that could take a week max
19:43  jinxdone2: trust me necromancer its not the IT staff that wants to keep old ie's around
19:43  necromancer: if the IT staff works overtime
19:43  coachz: sounds like a weak excuse
19:43  ajpiano: rofl
19:43  necromancer: it is a weak excuse but it saves them money
19:43  necromancer: IMO it's a lot of bullshit but that's the way these companies think...
19:44  coachz: where i work most are on leased laptops that get changed out with win 7 so at least that forces a new browser
19:44  sac: necromancer, well kinda bad setup if the upgrade requires visit to each desk
19:44  sac: but i bet there are many like that
19:44  necromancer: probably
19:45  coachz: i just can't image after 10 years of IE6 bashing that anyone would still have it
19:45  coachz: surely it's in the tiny minority by now
19:45  sac: it's sad :(
19:45  necromancer: well we don't always have to code for IE6
19:45  necromancer: this is a special request
19:45  sac: we do ie7+ only too, ie6 for extra price only
19:45  jinxdone2: I've stopped supporting it quite some time ago
19:45  necromancer: however, we've gotten pretty good around here...we barely even use browser-specific selectors anymore
19:45  coachz: ie6 for criminally insane
19:46  necromancer: all of our code works perfectly on all browsers, naturally
19:46  JohnnyL: ajpiano, i'd imagine if I put a bound checker in the draggable area it would suffice. Do you happen to have any non buggy jQuery DnD features?
19:46  ajpiano: JohnnyL: draggable has a containment option??
19:46  BarelyFitz: I'm seeing less than 5% IE users now. end-times are near.
19:46  necromancer: haha
19:46  coachz: amen
19:46  necromancer: IE in general?
19:46  necromancer: that's good...
19:46  coachz: i luckily have just ignored it all together
19:47  JohnnyL: ajpiano, is english your second language?
19:47  ajpiano: hooo boy
19:47  JohnnyL: ajpiano what part of 'if I put' makes it seem that it's already there?

20:04  erichynds: mekwall i dig i just think it over complicates things
20:05  erichynds: like extending the constructor onto the fn itself
20:06  erichynds: like new $.fn.myplugin.instance()._init(); instead of just new myPlugin();
20:07  WebNickel: If i were to use a $('a').live("click", function()...  and I wanted to create a div to slide to as link is clicked but i also needed the div to exist before they clicked it. what would be the best way to achieve this?
20:07  JohnnyL: same bug in  http://threedubmedia.com/demo/drag/
20:07  JohnnyL: bugz0rs
20:07  erichynds: and i'm not a fan of breaking the chain, although i realize that's hypocritical of me
20:07  WebNickel: i have all the .last.append down..
20:07  WebNickel: just not the rest
20:08  erichynds: also extend is unnecessary, $.fn.myPlugin.prototype = {}; is cleaner & faster

20:16  Jayse: hi, Im posting a form with the jquery form plugin. Im using ajaxSubmit and sending a request to a file that ONLY  returns "hello"
20:16  Jayse: but then Im alerting the response it has <html> and <body> tags?!
20:16  Jayse: how come? I really want get the return in plain text :/
20:16  vrtigo: look at the response in firebug
20:16  vrtigo: if it has html and body tags still, then its your response script which has the issue
20:17  vrtigo: you are using firebug, arent you?
20:17  Jayse: no
20:17  Jayse: Im using chrome
20:17  vrtigo: hm ok, well use its equivalent method of examining the response
20:18  Forbidd3n: can I pass two object to before
20:18  Forbidd3n: .before(li1,li2)
20:18  felcom: For a large js project is it better to use abstract methods and pass in the elements they act on as parameters to the method?
20:19  Jayse: vrtigo: I got no errors
20:19  ajpiano: felcom: it definitely helps
20:19  ajpiano: to make more modular code
20:19  vrtigo: sure, but look at the response content
20:19  vrtigo: does it have html and body tags?
20:19 --- kenno is now known as whateverb
20:19  vrtigo: if so, look at your response script
20:19  Jayse: vrtigo: yeah it has
20:19  vrtigo: then jquery isnt the problem
20:19  NemesisD: how do you combine (AND) filters?
20:19  wycks: Hello, I have a jquery fadeto hover that is flickering ( all browsers) and its messing up the ability to click, any suggestions?
20:19  Jayse: vrtigo: the file only contains "hello" but the response is "<html><body>hello</body></html>"
20:20  vrtigo: well your web server must be doing weird things
20:20  Jayse: vrtigo: oh okey
20:20  felcom: ajpiano: so then in the view i'd just have a block of method calls? It seems smarter and more awkward at the same tim
20:20  ajpiano: felcom, ya, i'm in the middle of grappling with that stuff myself
20:21  ajpiano: the whole "smarter but more awkward"
20:21  felcom: yeah heh
20:21  felcom: i want it to be easy for my backend guys and designers to see whats going on
20:21  ajpiano: well, modularising the code does
20:22  felcom: right thats what brought me to this solution
20:22  Forbidd3n: How would I make a UL expand/shrink to the childrens size within it?
20:22  ajpiano: cause like, the logic for the widget is completely selfcontained and they just have to know that, hey, this element is being invoked as such and such a widget
20:22  felcom: exactly
20:22  RingZer0: ajpiano: textReplace does not appear to be recursive... i can't search entire html document
20:23  ajpiano: you can't?
20:23  RingZer0: nope, workes great when I specify the h2 tag tho
20:23  RingZer0: lol
20:23  RingZer0: ajpiano: unless i do $('*').each(function(){ $(this).textReplace(......
20:24  RingZer0: selector works like glob right? * is wildcard?
20:24  ajpiano: $("*").replaceText()
20:24  ajpiano: not that like, $("*") is a good ide

20:35  LakWork: yeah that's understandable
20:35  LakWork: I'm a .NET developer so that's no big deal
20:35  Jayse: should I change mime type in apache?
20:35  vrtigo: um
20:36  vrtigo: what file extension is it?
20:36  vrtigo: .html?
20:36  Jayse: .js on the js-files

20:37  vrtigo: how?
20:37  vrtigo: anyway
20:37  Jayse: on page load yes
20:37  vrtigo: for a quick fix, use header('Content-type: text/plain');
20:37  vrtigo: in your php script
20:38  vrtigo: i assume thatll fix it, if i understand your problem

21:00  eTiger13: cambazz:  no it  is not a plugin
21:00  sac: ProLoser|Work, pro tip: the api is categorized, that is clearly manipulation so if you just check http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/ and see through the function names you would see that
21:00  Fuld: etcetera, any luck? :)
21:01  sac: also you could even do that with .after(yournewelement).remove() even if you didn't know about replaceWith()
21:01  eTiger13: Fuld: whats the animation? I see "Yay it worked."
21:02  Fuld: etcetera, okay. Did the box slide in from the right?

21:14  vrtigo: Jayse: create a new file with this
21:14  vrtigo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/556289/
21:14  vrtigo: also create a test.txt file with some text in it
21:14  vrtigo: then if that works, modify it to get the response from your php script
21:15  vrtigo: this is to narrow down where the problem is, and remove variables like the form plugin

21:26  Ely2: i it possible to create a jquery preloader for a flv file ?

21:27  felcom: just fine
21:27  felcom: as far as i'm aware
21:28  Forbidd3n: hover doesn't work with dynamically added objects on the dom
21:28  Forbidd3n: it doesn't appear that you can use hover with .live
21:28  Forbidd3n: unless you use mouseout and mouseover
21:28  Fuld: I'm getting this error in opera: Uncaught exception: ReferenceError: Undefined variable: $
21:29  Chadams: Fuld: Are you executing your script onload
21:29  ajpiano: Forbidd3n: use .live("mouseenter mouseleave"), that's what i always do
21:29  PE: i'm extending dialog. so how do i "extend" the _setOptions ?
21:30  Fuld: Chadams, no after document.body
21:30  Fuld: I think it's because the way I'm loading jquery is weird
21:31  ajpiano: PE, you have to do something like ...  _setOptions:function(options) { doStuff();  $.ui.dialog.prototype._setOptions.call(this,options)   })
21:31  Chadams: Has jquery been included before your script?
21:31  Forbidd3n: ajpiano: how would I check which event it is inside the function
21:31  Forbidd3n: nvm
21:31  Fuld: Chadams, jquery is downloaded with a synchronous xmlhttprequest() and injected into a script element that's appended to head
21:32  Michael: That's magical.
21:32  Fuld: Then the next line uses jquery, so Opera probably is running that before the script element is appended
21:33  ajpiano: Fuld: you have to use the load event of the script element
21:33  Chadams: Yea don't do that
21:33  Fuld: ajpiano, yes
21:33  Jayse: vrtigo: its the ajaxSubmit that dosent work
21:33  Chadams: Loa from google cache and use $(document).ready()
21:34  Chadams: Load
21:34  loa: =/
21:34  vrtigo: ajaxSubmit is part of the form plugin is it?
21:35  vrtigo: why not just use jquery standard .ajax?
21:35  kaylee_work: so is it possible to escape out of jquery to use prototype?
21:35  vrtigo: gather form data to send with .serialize()
21:35  ajpiano: vrtigo, ajaxSubmit works just fine
21:35  vrtigo: well in this case, its not
21:35  ajpiano: well what's breaking
21:36  vrtigo: where as .ajax() does

21:43  ajpiano: why???
21:43  ajpiano: why don't you use like
21:43  ajpiano: requireJS
21:43  ajpiano: or LABjs
21:44  Fuld: Why are those better?
21:44  Jayse: ajpiano: the ajaxSubmit problem. the responeText got some addtional html tags
21:44  Fuld: Anything worse wrong?
21:44 * Fuld is looking at requireJS()
21:44  ajpiano: cause um, they are tools that people have invested lots and lots of time and effort into for this explicit purpose
21:45  mekwall: bot-t: tell erichynds thanks alot for that mate! I'll revise it and come back to you :)
21:45  bot-t: mekwall, Okay.
21:45  Fuld: requireJS is async isn't it?
21:45  ajpiano: mostly
21:45  ajpiano: why do you want to load jquery synchronously
21:45  Fuld: Yeah, it is horrible
21:46  Fuld: And fails on Opera
21:46  ajpiano: Fuld: how long have you been like, working on this script load solution
21:46  Fuld: ajpiano, lol that was like 20 min
21:46  ajpiano: ya
21:46  ajpiano: so
21:47  Fuld: No, 10 minutes :)
21:47  mekwall: Fuld: doest it work everywhere?
21:47  mekwall: -t
21:47  ajpiano: why in your right mind do you think a script loader that you hacked on for 20 minutes is somehow an equally well vetted product to vetted, widely adopted tools like requireJS or LABjs etc
21:47  mekwall: Fuld: perhaps I should ask, how long have you been developing? :)
21:47  Fuld: ajpiano: I don't
21:48  ajpiano: ok
21:48  Fuld: mekwall: Since last August.
21:48  ajpiano: well i think you'd get a lot of mileage out of using one of those tools instead of rolling your own loader
21:48  mekwall: Fuld: ok, then you're pardoned
21:48  Fuld: I'm also writing Perl code and C on the server-side
21:49 * Fuld will get requireJS though
21:49  mekwall: Fuld: reinventing the wheel is strictly something that will waste your time, even if you thing you might be optimizing things according to what you need
21:49  Fuld: Sweet, also works in node
21:50  vrtigo: Jayse: i dont know why .ajaxSubmit() doesnt work like you expect it to - i dont use it. just use .ajax() instead, thats all you need anyway
21:50  mekwall: Fuld: I agree wholeheartedl with ajpiano on this one... even if you think requirejs or labjs is a bit over the top for what you need, it's really not a good idea to develop something those libs already do :)
21:51  coachz: is there an easy way to make my dialog cancel button the default for the enter key ?

21:55  mekwall: Fuld: I did the same thing back when I started developing, and yes I did learn alot of things... but I also wasted many years on something that never really became useful
21:56  mekwall: Fuld: that's the beauty with open source, you can contribute to existing projects that will actually be usable
21:56  mekwall: Fuld: even as a "noob" you can contribute, solely by showing interest in contributing... you'll learn alot from the community, and eventually you might be joining the core dev team :)
21:57 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 102 seconds
21:57  coachz: So how do i set the focus to my Cancel button,  it doesn't have an id but the parent dialog does.   https://gist.github.com/788651
21:57  Fuld: Yeah, I expect to be reaching professional level by the end of March
21:58  mekwall: coachz: is cancel the last button?
21:59  mekwall: coachz: I rather not use the :contains selector, so if you can use :last
21:59  Seb___: Hello guys, I have a question : really like to learn jquery : what is the best book or website you will advise ?
21:59  coachz: yeah, i'm trying this:   $(this).parent('delfdbk').find('button:contains("Cancel")').focus()	
21:59  Fuld: My next goal is to master closures.
21:59  mekwall: coachz: use :last instead of :contains
21:59  mekwall: :contains is really slow :)
21:59  coachz: actually no, sorry it's not the last button
21:59  coachz: 2nd to last
21:59  mekwall: Fuld: if you ask me, you can never master anything when it comes to tech/IT hehe
22:00  mekwall: coachz: will it always be the 2nd to last?
22:00  coachz: yes mekwall
22:00  mekwall: coachz: use :eq
22:00  mekwall: ?:eq @ coachz
22:00  bot-t: coachz, :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
22:01  mekwall: coachz: only use :contains / .contains when you really have to
22:01 --- Rogi_ is now known as Rogi
22:01  ajpiano: there is no $.fn.contains :)
22:01  ajpiano: jQuery.contains is really fast but does something completley different
22:01  coachz: ok thanks, so with OK and Cancel is my index for Cancel 1 ?
22:03  coachz: i tried   $('#delfdbk').eq(1).focus();	   but no focus happens
22:03  mekwall: whoa... nearly hurt myself badly, my whole set of knives fell to the floor and I nearly stepped right on one of them ... phew
22:03  coachz: jesus
22:04  mekwall: ajpiano: haha right :) sometimes I expect too my hehe
22:04  mekwall: my = much
22:05  coachz: no luck setting focus like this:   https://gist.github.com/788668
22:05  mekwall: ajpiano: btw, how's going with nina kinert?
22:05  mekwall: coachz: do it in the open event
22:06  wontoner: I'm using jQuery's .ajax() function and i'm receving a json data object. How can I find/replace all the single quotes in the json data with the html code &#39;
22:06  wontoner: and still pass it along as a json object
22:06  ajpiano: mekwall: been meaning to tell you, i'm a big fan
22:06  ajpiano: listened to that album a bunch of tgimes
22:07  mekwall: ajpiano: i'm happy to hear :D
22:07  mekwall: whenever I speak to her (on facebook) I'll tell her :D
22:08  ajpiano: you are still friends? nice!
22:08  klj613: can can i bind lightBox "live" ? (elements which aint in existant yet)
22:09  lrvick: hey all. anyone know a way for me to easily output raw json into a div?
22:09  mekwall: ajpiano: we'll always be I guess... we studied together for 6 years :)
22:09  ajpiano: oh nice
22:09  mekwall: ajpiano: from 3rd grade to 9th
22:09  ajpiano: aw adorbs
22:09  mekwall: well, in swedish terms hehe
22:09  lrvick: lets say i have 'foo.body' which is json. waht if i just want to take that in plaintext and do an appendto it into a div ?
22:10  TheEmpath: any reason why &nbsp; appears in dialogs instead of it being converted to an ISO space?
22:10  mekwall: ajpiano: our class travelled to rhodos together and did some really nice concerts at a church and at the hotel we were staying at :)
22:11  ajpiano: cool, what do oyu play
22:11  mekwall: ajpiano: ever heard about oskar linnros?
22:11  ajpiano: naw
22:12  mekwall: ajpiano: well, it was mostly singing in the class, but outside of that I played drums for 11 years, in a local rock/pop band
22:12  ajpiano: oh awesome.  come to new york, we need a drummer
22:12  mekwall: nowadays I only sing in the shower, which is sad :/
22:12  wontoner: I tried to do json.replace("'","&#39;") but there's not replace function on the json object
22:13  Seb___: any recommandation on a book to learn jquery ?
22:13  mekwall: ajpiano: haha, I plan to go to NY eventually hehe
22:13  ajpiano: ?jqfundamentals @ Seb___
22:13  bot-t: Seb___, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/book/book.html
22:13  mekwall: ^--- best book out there!
22:13  coachz: jquery in action is nice by Manning
22:13  Brodingo: and its freeeeeee
22:13  coachz: is there a pdf for that mekwall
22:14  mekwall: any old school paper books are outdated imo
22:14  mekwall: coachz: jquery in action? I might have lagged P
22:14  mekwall: I meant jq fundamentals
22:14  Brodingo: got my jq cookbook pdf from jq summit :)
22:14  coachz: jQuery fundamentals, i think i see a pdf
22:14  coachz: http://jqfundamentals.com/pdf/jquery-fundamentals-book.pdf
22:15  mekwall: Brodingo: how did your html5 rectangles turn out? :)
22:15  Brodingo: decent i made a lil thermometer widget thingy
22:15  Brodingo: http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/762Hd/3/
22:16  TheEmpath: anyone know why a modal isn't parsing &nbsp; into spaces?
22:16  Seb___: cool thanks guys
22:16  Brodingo: i thought i could do some cool masking stuff but some of the drawing in canvas was going over my head a bit
22:16  coachz: Is this the right way to focus my cancel button cuz i can't get it to work.   https://gist.github.com/788694
22:16  mekwall: Brodingo: gonna make it so it can actually measure temperature? :D
22:16  Brodingo: haha oh god
22:17 --- sonuloveu is now known as sonuloveu-afk
22:17  Brodingo: im trying to figure the best way to do a cool meter widget for fundraising actually
22:17  mekwall: coachz: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/2348v/ <--- something like that
22:17  Brodingo: still just thinking about idea though
22:18  coachz: nice mekwall
22:18  coachz: thx
22:18  mekwall: don't thank me before you know it works hehe
22:18  mekwall: just pointing you in the right direction
22:18  coachz: so you put an anonymous function in the declaration
22:19  mekwall: coachz: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-open
22:19  mekwall: just hooking into the open event
22:19  coachz: no worky
22:20  mekwall: coachz: try with focus event
22:20  coachz: isn't that what you did?     $(this).find('button:eq(1)').focus();
22:20  mekwall: focus: instead of open: :)
22:20  coachz: k
22:21  coachz: nope
22:21  Jester831: hey so, how does partial https work with jquery ajax?
22:22  coachz: jquery is usually so simple, i would have expected a 'default' property on my dialog button
22:22  ProLoser|Work: hey
22:22  Jester831: can I have a page that loads https, does https ajax, and does http swfupload uploads
22:22  ProLoser|Work: okay so can you paste the code?
22:22  ProLoser|Work: ~bin
22:22  ProLoser|Work: ]bin
22:22  ProLoser|Work: ~pastebin
22:22  coachz: https://gist.github.com/788704
22:22  ProLoser|Work: !pastebin
22:22  ProLoser|Work: !paste
22:23  ProLoser|Work: i give up
22:23  vladikoff: ?paste
22:23  bot-t: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
22:23  ProLoser|Work: lol
22:23  Jester831: is jquery.ajax inherently sent https on https pages?
22:24  mekwall: coachz: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/2348v/1/
22:24  mekwall: there you go
22:24  mekwall: realized you need to base from its parent
22:24  eTiger13: Jester831: why would you? why not have the upload do https as well?
22:24  Jester831: well, an https upload would be a lot slower no?
22:25  eTiger13: not really no.
22:25  Jester831: the uploads are only going to be images
22:25  eTiger13: like, at all
22:25  royboy789: hey, i got my jquery working the way i want, but how do I make it work across multiple instances (in the example i need multiple "images" divs with different images, and each has its own "desc") - http://pastebin.com/dJw85LEZ
22:25  Jester831: ah ok that solves that question
22:25  coachz: sec
22:25  Jester831: now then, does jquery ajax automatically send over https when loaded as https?
22:26  ProLoser|Work: royboy789: can you pastebin the html?
22:26  coachz: that works !   so how did you figure out that it needs to come from parent ?
22:26  eTiger13: royboy789:  have a parent div that has the image and desc and then just have the hover operate on those
22:26  royboy789: http://pastebin.com/xSDsNV2f
22:26  eTiger13: Jester831: it should
22:26  clarkfischer: royboy789: That will work on all img.images tags
22:26  Jester831: It's described solely as an "asynchronous http Ajax request" and there is no mention of https whatsoever on the jquery api
22:26  clarkfischer: royboy789: But, it'll also show all elements with class .div every time.
22:27  royboy789: the way i have it setup, no matter what img you roll over, the "desc" div shows up
22:27  royboy789: when within each "images" div, there is a UNIQUE "desc"
22:27  royboy789: and i only want that one showing up when i hover over the img within "images"
22:27  eTiger13: Jester831: it uses whatever the document is using
22:28  Jester831: nice, thanks mate
22:29  Jester831: I'd have felt pretty crappy if all my https ajax was randomly http and I was forgetting some setting haha
22:29  eTiger13: royboy789:  change the $(desc) to $(this).next('.desc')
22:29  coachz: mekwall,   thanks very much
22:29  mekwall: coachz: yw :)
22:29  coachz: how did you think to base from parent ?
22:30  mekwall: coachz: checked the dom
22:30  Adman65: Hey guys. I'm looking for a plugin that will allow me to make help style popups. The idea is you click an icon, then you a div appears over that icon, then scrolls with icon as you scroll the page, then the div can be closed
22:30  coachz: ahhh
22:30  mekwall: coachz: where the this element was located ;)
22:30  ProLoser|Work: royboy789: i'll be right back if you don't get it figured out
22:30  coachz: how come my Cancel button shows to the left of the OK?   I have this:   							  "Ok": function() { $(this).dialog('close'); delfeedback(); },
22:30  coachz: 							  "Cancel": function() { $(this).dialog('close'); }	
22:31  coachz: where OK is first
22:31  coachz: yet cancel shows up first on the dialog
22:31  royboy789: ok ProLoser|Work
22:31  wontoner: How can I convert this json object into a string, run a replace on that string and then convert it back into a json object?
22:32  erichynds: json is a string :)
22:32  erichynds: ?stringify @ wontoner
22:32  bot-t: wontoner, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
22:32  wontoner: i have a json object from jquery's .ajax() function
22:32  erichynds: you have a JS object
22:33  bot-t: wontoner, There's No Such Thing as a "JSON Object" http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/
22:33  wontoner: I have an object that is described as type 'json' by the jquery .ajax function
22:33  wontoner: hot-t: better?
22:34  erichynds: jquery converts the result into a JS object for you
22:34 --- kiddphunk__ is now known as kiddphunk
22:34  erichynds: the response is JSON, but by the time it hits your success handler, it's an object
22:35  tesseracter: ive got a form, and i want to send the files back via ajax before i submit the rest of the form, so i dont lose them. so i don't want to submit the entire form. i haven't seen any barebones ways to do this with .post(), anyone got a good link?
22:35  wontoner: Is there an easy to way to search all strings on an object and run a replace() call on them?
22:35  mekwall: erichynds: hey mate :) thanks alot for your comments
22:35  mekwall: I really appreciate it
22:36  mekwall: erichynds: about your last comment, I agree... but then again you don't have to implement some kind of check
22:36  mekwall: erichynds: the rest, I agree and will revise accordingly
22:36  eTiger13: wontoner: can you just change the response on the server side?
22:37  eTiger13: tesseracter: so you want to submit the forms values before you submit the form as a page?
22:37  erichynds: mekwall cool :)
22:37  mekwall: coachz: try to change place on them ;)
22:37 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
22:37  coachz: i did, they reverse, the opposite of the order in code,  hehehe no worries
22:37  mekwall: erichynds: that pattern is actually based on your widget pattern used in your notification :) I really liked it, semantically
22:38  eTiger13: erichynds: are you on twitter?
22:38  mekwall: eTiger13: http://twitter.com/#!/erichynds
22:38  tesseracter: eTiger13, i want to submit files of the form (long form) before i run back and hit full validation(which might lost the file uploads)
22:38  erichynds: mekwall, yah, i actually grabbed that pattern out of jquery ui dialog widget
22:38  erichynds: but i don't really like it
22:38  mekwall: erichynds: oh? :)
22:39  mekwall: erichynds: sure, you can reduce it code-wise but that will result in less readable code
22:39  eTiger13: tesseracter: like gmail when attaching emails?
22:39  erichynds: i think it's more readble
22:39  erichynds: readable
22:39  mekwall: hehe
22:40  mekwall: erichynds: well, isn't that the whole purpose with using prototype anyways?
22:40  mekwall: I'm a total noob when it comes to javascript (which is kinda weird I know)
22:40  erichynds: mekwall, yeah, it's still a prototype though
22:40  tesseracter: eTiger13, that sounds similar, although flash isnt on our stack, and i actually have a button they could be clicking before going on to the rest of the form. no need to have progress bars and such.
22:40  mekwall: good at jquery but noob at js :D
22:40  erichynds: just the constructor is in a different location
22:41  wontoner: eTiger13: that's what I'm looking into right now
22:41  erichynds: there's no reason for it to exist on $.fn.plugin
22:41  eTiger13: tesseracter: flash is the easist way to go ajaxy uploads
22:41  mekwall: erichynds: well I'd be happy to improve on this pattern with your help
22:41  erichynds: mekwall https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L680
22:41  eTiger13: wontoner: or have it return type text, do you replaces and then parse the json
22:41  tesseracter: eTiger13, is that what ajaxForm uses?
22:42  mekwall: erichynds: http://milan.adamovsky.com/2010/09/jquery-plugin-pattern-20.html
22:42  mekwall: did you check that out=
22:42  mekwall: ?
22:42  wontoner: eTiger13: that isn't a bad idea
22:42  mekwall: erichynds: what I really like is that it's chainable in a different sense as most plugins are
22:42  mekwall: erichynds: and how .end() is kinda working like jquery .end()
22:42  cambazz: hello, what if i want to log some user behaivor on a page, and send it on the background like events, what strategy must i follow
22:42  erichynds: haven't really looked at the code, but i know that ben_alman doesn't like it.. which is enough for me :)
22:43  mekwall: you "enter" the plugins scope and can chain in there, and then return to the element
22:43  ben_alman: which?
22:43  eTiger13: ? ajax file upload @ tesseracter
22:43  bot-t: tesseracter, Ajax Iframe file upload | jQuery Plugins - Well, it's not really Ajax uploading considering file upload with ajax is not possible, but the end result is similar. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/iframe-post-form
22:43  royboy789: any new suggestions, I am trying to cross fade image with text, when hovering... on a multiple basis (each specific image must fade with specific text), is there a main function that will do them without having to put in function for each image
22:43  eTiger13: wontoner: although if you are doing this on every returned result, modifing it at the server level is better
22:43  mekwall: erichynds: so ben_alman decides what you should think? I'm not sure he would agree with that :)
22:43  erichynds: mekwall, yeah, i like the widget factory pattern better where you call methods through the interface.. dialog("close")
22:43  mekwall: with=to
22:43  erichynds: mekwall, read the comments on that post
22:44  eTiger13: royboy789:  i told, like at .next or .siblings
22:44  mekwall: erichynds: alrighty
22:44  tesseracter: eTiger13, i see, ajaxForm uses iframe. thanks.
22:44  mekwall: erichynds: thing is, I think it's slower
22:44  mekwall: since it's not really native :)
22:44  ben_alman: mekwall: the only real advantage to being able to do $.fn.foo.bar instead of $.fn.fooBar is that $.fn.foo might be enumerable in some way. other than that, it's all downsides
22:44  mekwall: ben_alman: that's not what I do
22:45  cambazz: is there a starts with in jquery?
22:45  ben_alman: like, a) confusing the chaining metaphor and b) adding a lot of extra code
22:45  Brodingo: ^=
22:45  Brodingo: i believe
22:45  mekwall: ben_alman: I do $fn.boo.bar instead of $fn.foo("bar")
22:45  eTiger13: ?selectors @ cambazz

22:45  geneller: hi there, guys i got a question, i already "solved" my problem, but my solution its not ok with me, so i'm searching for a better answer, i got two fields, i want to keep theirs values but clear all the other inputs, so i knew that my problem is with the .not() selector, here its the code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1100962922
22:45  geneller: first one its working "fine" but i think that the second solution would be the best
22:45  ben_alman: it's still a lot more code and confuses the chaining metaphor
22:46  mekwall: ben_alman: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/8ZWuD/ <--- eric already left his comments, if you want to add something I'd really appreciate it
22:46  mekwall: ah, he changed the code as well
22:46  mekwall: hold on
22:47  ben_alman: mekwall, jQuery 1.5 is probably going to add support for subclassing jQuery, so this will probably not be of value
22:47  Jortuny: howdy, anyone here have a problem with hover being 'sticky' (not doing the mouseleave event)
22:47  mekwall: ben_alman: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/JZq2N/ <--- that's my code
22:47  eTiger13: in Chrome's tools, how do i view an ajax response?
22:47  mekwall: ben_alman: probably is not good enough :)
22:47  ben_alman: mekwall: what does that mean?
22:48  mekwall: ben_alman: which means what? " probably is not good enough" ?
22:48  ben_alman: with your code, you can't create a plugin that traverses the dom and is .end able
22:48  ben_alman: and also has sub-methods
22:48  ben_alman: because .end is now overridden
22:48  mekwall: ben_alman: ah, .end is just an internal function of the plugin
22:48  ben_alman: yes
22:48  ben_alman: i have a plugin patter njust like this
22:49  ben_alman: it's sitting on my desktop in a file called bad_stateful_jquery_plugin_factory.js
22:49  mekwall: ben_alman: .end is not overridden?
22:49  ben_alman: in mine, it is
22:49  mekwall: the name of .end is just metaphorical
22:49  ben_alman: i used .end exactly as you did
22:49  mekwall: well I haven't seen yours so I wouldn't know :)
22:50  ben_alman: my implementation is different, but it effectivley does the same thing
22:50  ben_alman: but the problem is that it gets confusing, inside the chain, what methods are available
22:50  wontoner: eTiger13: I owe you one
22:50  ben_alman: it's hard to use.
22:50 --- Chainfire_ is now known as Chainfire
22:50  mekwall: ben_alman: I disagree, but it's easy for me to do that ofcourse :)
22:50  ben_alman: np
22:50  wontoner: I just used text and then converted to json after my replace call using $.parseJSON
22:51  mekwall: ben_alman: with the proper indentation it's easy to keep track of where you are in the chain imo
22:51  ben_alman: either way, a lot of us in here have discussed it, and we pretty much all agree that it's confusing
22:51  eTiger13: wontoner: for what?
22:51  ben_alman: but you're of course welcome to do whatever you'd like
22:51  eTiger13: wontoner: oh. does the "one" equal the 27" Dell IPS monitor?
22:51  mekwall: ben_alman: using native function calls like foo.bar is better then foo(bar)
22:52  wontoner: eTiger13: Your recommendation was a good one.. i was trying to do a string replace within a json formatted object
22:52  ben_alman: mekwall: that's a matter of opinion
22:52  mekwall: ben_alman: sure, everything have it's cons and pros
22:52  wontoner: apparently that's like pulling teeth with JS, so i just used text for my data type setting and then converted using parseJSON
22:52  ben_alman: while i agree with your sentiment on a theoretical level, i disagree from a practical standpoint
22:52  ben_alman: it's simply harder for people to use
22:52  ben_alman: because they get confused where they are in the chain
22:52  royboy789: thanks guys - the $(this).next('.desc') worked... never knew that i could do that
22:52  ben_alman: even with indentation and end
22:53  mekwall: ben_alman: I respect that, and it probably is enough to scrap the pattern
22:53 --- LV is now known as LordVorp
22:53  eTiger13: royboy789:  yw. take some time and go through the api docs. its helpful
22:53  ben_alman: that's why i scrapped mine
22:53  ben_alman: :/
22:53  mekwall: ben_alman: hehe, no need for the sad face
22:53  geneller: hi someone?
22:53  geneller: hi there, guys i got a question, i already "solved" my problem, but my solution its not ok with me, so i'm searching for a better answer, i got two fields, i want to keep theirs values but clear all the other inputs, so i knew that my problem is with the .not() selector, here its the code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1100962922
22:53  mekwall: ben_alman: everything evolves and adapts :)
22:54  geneller: first one its working "fine" but i think that the second solution would be the best
22:54  mekwall: ben_alman: I'm just here to contribute, not to put my name on it and say it's the best :D
22:54  serio: is the colour picker no longer in jQ UI?
22:54  ajpiano: there never was a color picker in jqui
22:55  eTiger13: ?color picker
22:55  bot-t: eTiger13, jQuery UI Slider - Colorpicker - http://ui2.jquery.com/demos/slider/colorpicker.html
22:55  serio: I must be dreaming
22:55  mekwall: ben_alman: do you mind sharing your scrapped pattern?
22:55  ben_alman: hmmn
22:55  ben_alman: i might have a gist
22:55  mekwall: ben_alman: would be cool to take a look at your implementation
22:55  serio: slider colour picker = fail
22:56  serio: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137750/ColorPicker
22:56  serio: is it actually in the roadmap?
22:56  ben_alman: i don't have it posted
22:56  ben_alman: but it was just a proof of concept
22:56  ben_alman: not even remotely finished
22:56  ben_alman: so it's not really worth showing
22:56  ben_alman: i hadn't even got into the inheritance, i was just using $.extend to copy methods over
22:56  eTiger13: "how do I create a copy of an object, instead of just creating a reference to it?"
22:57  ben_alman: and then in .end returning the original obj
22:57  mekwall: ben_alman: just like mine heh
22:57  ProLoser|Work: royboy789: you get your shit figured out?
22:57  mekwall: ben_alman: I see.... well I thought about messing with the jQuery object prototype, but felt it wouldn't be very jQueryish
22:57  royboy789: yup
22:57  ben_alman: when jQuery is subclassable it'll be interesting
22:58  mekwall: ben_alman: so that you could call the plugins functions directly on the jquery object
22:58  ben_alman: well, imagine having a subclass of jQuery in your plugin
22:58  ben_alman: then you prototype your methods on top of that
22:59  mekwall: ben_alman: yeah that'll be great :)
22:59  ben_alman: and then when you instantiate your plugin, you return a new one of those, with the props copied over
22:59  ben_alman: and when you end, you just return the original obj
22:59  ben_alman: but still... it'd make chaining confusing
22:59  mekwall: ben_alman: I just wonder how compatible it will be
23:00  mekwall: ben_alman: oh, so it will essentially work like mine / your pattern?
23:00  ben_alman: well, you could make it do that if you really wanted to
23:00  ben_alman: not that you would.
23:00  ben_alman: but you could.
23:00  mekwall: hehe
23:00  mekwall: ben_alman: so I should scrap this pattern and wait for 1.5?
23:01  ben_alman: i'd scrap it in general and use the jQuery UI widget factory
23:01  mekwall: ben_alman: I do already use the jquery ui widget factory ;)
23:01  ben_alman: i made a "lite" version of that as well, but i'm not sold on the benefit of my code
23:01  mekwall: ben_alman: http://jsfiddle.net/user/mekwall/fiddles/
23:01  mekwall: all those jquery ui stuff uses the factory
23:01  ben_alman: https://gist.github.com/652131
23:01  mekwall: ben_alman: just a disclaimer... most of it is speed coded ;)
23:01  ben_alman: this is super-simple
23:01  ben_alman: no events, no inheritance, nothing
23:02  ben_alman: just state and sub-methods
23:02  ajpiano: mekwall: holy crap !!!!!
23:02 --- sonuloveu-afk is now known as sonuloveu
23:02  mekwall: ajpiano: what?
23:02  ben_alman: i will totally re-vamp at some point
23:02  ajpiano: these ui widgets are.... so awesome!
23:02  mekwall: ajpiano: ehm... seriously?=
23:02  ajpiano: can i use them?
23:02  ajpiano: are they on github?!?
23:02  mekwall: ajpiano: .... sure :D
23:03  ben_alman: maybe he should put them on github
23:03  mekwall: ajpiano: I'm gonna add them there
23:03  ajpiano: mekwall: please do
23:03  mekwall: ajpiano: I just made them for work, they will all be open source licensed ofc
23:03  ajpiano: holy crap, editor
23:03  ajpiano: dude
23:03  mekwall: ajpiano: editor is just a proof of concept
23:03  ajpiano: ya but still
23:03  mekwall: hehe :)
23:04  ajpiano: this is all hella tight
23:04  mekwall: yeah if worked on it may be awesome
23:04  justinhjohnson: noob question, what is the double !! used for?
23:04  justinhjohnson: return !!$.data( elem, widget_name );
23:04  mekwall: ajpiano: just started with ui.table ;)
23:04  erichynds: justinhjohnson, coerces it into a boolean value then flips it
23:04  ajpiano: i just started working on inline edit
23:05  mekwall: ajpiano: notification widget was coded in 3 hours
23:05  mekwall: and it's stable imo
23:05  ajpiano: notification is baller
23:05  ben_alman: erichynds: don't say the "and flips it" part
23:05  erichynds: what's the proper verbiage?
23:05  mekwall: ajpiano: yup, I don't even remember coding it lol
23:05  erichynds: negates.. ?
23:05  ben_alman: well, "coerces it to a boolean"
23:05  mekwall: ajpiano: what you think about tagging?
23:05  ben_alman: ?eval [ !!0, !!1, !!"", !!"a", !!function(){}, !!true !!false ]
23:05  bot-t: ben_alman: SyntaxError: missing ] after element list
23:06  ben_alman: ?eval [ !!0, !!1, !!"", !!"a", !!function(){}, !!true, !!false ]
23:06  bot-t: ben_alman: [false, true, false, true, true, true, false]
23:06 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:07  ajpiano: i don't think the tagging one is working in chrome
23:07  Needhelp: Need some newbie help. I have a couple of div's that I want to perform the same action on onmouseover and onmouseout. I know this won't work, but you'll get an idea what I'm trying to do: http://pastebin.com/4efNSTt5
23:07  mekwall: ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mcWnL/36/ <--- try inputting @paul @john
23:07  ajpiano: oh right, the @
23:07  mekwall: yeah
23:08  mekwall: ajpiano: that one is actually made for a question on stackoverflow hehe
23:08  mekwall: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4661482/jquery-facebook-like-tag-feature/4661513#4661513
23:08  justinhjohnson: one more quick question…if you pass a callback function and you want to execute it, is there a benefit to using callback.call(params) vs callback(params)?
23:08  ajpiano: this is clever, i wonder if there's a way to like meld that functionality into the generic list builder stuff i was showing you
23:08  mekwall: ajpiano: well, even better is to use a contenteditable div
23:08  mekwall: ajpiano: that's my next step
23:09  ajpiano: for the tagging or for the editor?
23:09  mekwall: ajpiano: tagging
23:09  ajpiano: i'm using contenteditable for my inline edit
23:09  ajpiano: ah
23:09  mekwall: for editor it has to be iframe with designMode
23:09  ajpiano: ah
23:09  parndt: hey, is there any way to ensure that a .bind() happens after all other events that are currently bound to that button?
23:09  mekwall: ajpiano: editor is only working in chrome because it's not getting the iframes document properly in other browsers
23:09  parndt: or is that just not possible
23:10  ajpiano: mekwall: so with notification, i basically put a notification region, and then i just register notifications with it, and position that region however i want
23:10  ajpiano: and boom?
23:10  mekwall: ajpiano: yup
23:10  ajpiano: tight
23:10  mekwall: ajpiano: and you have to use some of the css styles as well
23:11  mekwall: ajpiano: but color and so on will be inherited from the theme
23:11  Brodingo: taskbar is baller
23:11  mekwall: Brodingo: hehe, I needed that for my admin ui
23:11  ajpiano: yea taskbar is ballin
23:11  mekwall: that's actually why I created all these widgets
23:11  Brodingo: very cool
23:11  ajpiano: yea they're perfect
23:11  mekwall: taskbar need loads more css styles to look good
23:11  ajpiano: for that stuff
23:12  ajpiano: mekwall: you should change the namespace and then put these on github asap :D
23:12  mekwall: ajpiano: may I pm you?
23:12  mekwall: ajpiano: its for the admin ui so rather not share it here ;)
23:13  ajpiano: bot-t: tell gnarf pm me when you're around
23:13  bot-t: ajpiano, Okay.
23:13  Forbidd3n: would this append the next UL to the DIV?
23:13  Forbidd3n: $(this).closest('div').append(ul);
