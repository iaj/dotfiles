00:07  rns: anyone know why this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/AqD3ETug
00:11  RTPMatt: ns: are you sure you mean $.cookie(cookieName, $(this).find("h3").index(ui.newHeader[0]));  and not $.cookie(cookieName, $(this).accordion("option","active"));  ?
00:12 --- Crash is now known as Guest35189
00:13  Guest35189: Last year I made something that used a Post that returned HTML.  I figure this is probably not the best way to do it.  What is?
00:13  RTPMatt: Guest35189: probably not
00:14  Guest35189: What is?/
00:15  RTPMatt: Guest35189: usually returning JSON, and then doing something, if you need html, probably something involving templates
00:15  RTPMatt: hard to say what is best without knowing what you are trying to acomplish
00:16  Guest35189: Well, here http://67.23.12.211/login.php
00:17  RTPMatt: Guest35189: looking at that give me zero insite into what you are trying to acomplish
00:18  Guest35189: Can you be more specific, then?  It either returns Good, an error or a Registration form.
00:18  Guest35189: That is, plaintext or HTML
00:20  RTPMatt: Guest35189: ok, i see now.  it is giving a 404 on submit BTW, but I would suggest you return JSON with the result that you can then test in your javascript
00:20  RTPMatt: ? JSON
00:20  bot-t: RTPMatt, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
00:21  Guest35189: RTPMatt, yeah, it's an old proof-of-concept and somehow the post got deleted so I'm trying to write it back in and figured I'd optimize it.
00:22  RTPMatt: good idea
00:22  rns: RTPMatt: I updated it, but still doesn't work.  Any other ideas? http://pastebin.com/msymf8TV
00:23  timmywil: paul_irish: i have problems with font-face in IE.  could this be a server config issue?  im using bulletproof
00:24  timmywil: my local server is rack, im hoping that's the only problem
00:24  RTPMatt: rns: in what way does it "not work"?
00:25  zachera: when i parse json, it loses its consistency
00:26  rns: RTPMatt: the accordion doesn't work at all.  However, if I comment out the change option which sets the cookie, the accordion works, but the state won't save
00:26  RTPMatt: zachera: what?
00:26  zachera: or, actually, i think $.each is sorting the json
00:27  zachera: RTPMatt: i have a json response which gives me a list of states
00:27  RTPMatt: rns: try setting the cookie to just an int or something and see if that works
00:27  zachera: i do an ajax request for a list of states in the US
00:27  zachera: the json returns Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas ...
00:27  zachera: but Arkansas has a lower ID than Alabama, so Arkansas is placed before Alabama
00:28  RTPMatt: zachera: objects in javascript are not ordered, so you can never be sure what order you will get.  if you need a specific order, you need to use an array.
00:28  rns: RTPMatt: No that doesn't work either
00:29  RTPMatt: rns: cookie setting seems to be the problem then, try setting a cookie somewhere else and see if that works
00:31  zachera: RTPMatt: the ajax response: http://i54.tinypic.com/mk93yd.jpg
00:31  zachera: and, when i use $.parseJSON on the ajax response: http://i56.tinypic.com/52hzlx.jpg

09:42  doonie: yea for the bottom left/right parts
09:42  doonie: still cool
09:43  doonie: you should make a js game :)
09:43  mekwall: doonie: I can't take all the credits, most of the calculation comes from fg
09:44  mekwall: I'm just refining it
09:44  doonie: just share the credz then heh
09:44  doonie: still like it
09:44  mekwall: and will implement into my jquery ui tooltip fork
09:44  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/fHpjF/
09:44  mekwall: already in there, but looks like crap atm ;)
09:45  doonie: nice, i'd use it :) currentpy use the toolbox one
09:46  doonie: ah i mean tools http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html
09:46  doonie: hard to find tooltips that stay on hover
09:46  mekwall: omg
09:46  mekwall: dont use that
09:46  doonie: have to ;D not many that did what i wanted it to do
09:47  mekwall: heh, you can use mine :)
09:47  doonie: when you finish it i sure will ;D
09:47  doonie: whats wrong with this anyhow ;D
09:49  mekwall: doonie: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/fHpjF/41/

09:49  schweizer: ok thx Visage
09:49  doonie: yea
09:50  kaseano: I have a bunch of text_fields that I'm controlling w jquery, what's the event for when someone presses enter after typing something in a text_field ?
09:51  mekwall: doonie: crappy coded if you ask me
09:51  mekwall: and will eventually give you a headache due to compatibility reasons
09:51  doonie: =) i like the ui implementation of yours, since my site runs the ui themes
09:51  mekwall: with jquery ui
09:51  mekwall: yeah that's the reason with it
09:51  mekwall: however, callouts are png pics in that one
09:51  mekwall: so you'd have to make your own if you want to use em :)
09:52  mekwall: with later releases I'll use css arrows where that won't be needed
09:52  dr0id: can anyone help me improve this code, http://pastie.org/private/6sa12d0hm5zf00z7nf3yoa ?

09:53  dr0id: is that from the jquery ui only ?
09:53  doonie: jq ui dependant
09:55  doonie: -13 today ;(
09:55  mekwall: dr0id: it's based on the latest jquery ui tooltip from git
09:56  mekwall: I've added some missing stuff... sticky tooltip, mouse tracking, callouts
09:56  mekwall: and improved configuration

09:58  mekwall: sry, no time :/
09:58  kaseano: can I get an enter event on the text_field that's not part of a form?
09:58  mekwall: need to develop  a single page admin interface
09:59  mekwall: kaseano: just bind the keydown to that input
09:59  mekwall: e.which == 13  iirc
10:02  stvs: Can anyone help me with this (read the PROBLEM: comment) http://pastie.org/1394461
10:03  mekwall: kaseano: $('input').bind('keydown keypress', function(event){ if (event.keyCode == '13') { event.preventDefault(); }); try that :)
10:03  kaseano: oh wow, thanks mekwall
10:03  mekwall: not sure if keydown is necessary, might work with just .keypress
10:03  mekwall: eh
10:03  mekwall: not event.keyCode, use event.which
10:03  mekwall: my bad
10:03  kaseano: well I'm torn on whether it's simple to
10:03  sean`: just use keydown

10:07  kaseano: it works :) thx mekwall
10:08  mekwall: kaseano: did you use event.which instead of event.keyCode ?
10:09  kaseano: no I forgot to switch it out, it works fine tho.  You think I should change it?
10:10  mekwall: kaseano: $('input').keydown(function(event){ if (event.which == '13') { event.preventDefault(); });
10:10  kaseano: oh you took out the bind too
10:10  hExDj: I have an array with certain values and want to see if any of those values are contained within a string, regardless of case, is it possible?
10:10  mekwall: shouldn't be necessary
10:10  mekwall: kaseano: .keydown is a shortcut to .bind('keydown'
10:10  kaseano: oh ok. ya made the switch and that 1 works too
10:11  kaseano: thx
10:11  mekwall: preventing default behavior of enter key on keydown should effectively stop keypress and for the event to reach the form
10:12  mekwall: kaseano: e.keyCode usually works as well, but not on all browsers :p
10:12  mekwall: e.which is normalized by jquery so that one should always work

10:18  mekwall: ningia: before/after is for moving/inserting elements/content
10:18  mekwall: has nothing to do with effects

10:19  NiftyLettuce: how do I use SSL and YUI compressor to encrypt/compress my javascript?

10:35  giampaolo: hi, I'm using jQuery.getJSON() to pass data between client and server. jQuery.getJSON is called every time tough, and I don't want that. I want to load the json string into a variable so that I make only one request. Is there something to do that?
10:37  Vorspire: var json = '{ "hello": "world" }'; ?
10:38  bot-t: giampaolo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
10:40  Rails: hey guys, i'm using jquery ui combobox. it works fine except for the dynamically added form attributes, any help??
10:42  giampaolo: bot-t: this is how I retrieve the json: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307769/
10:42  bot-t: giampaolo, Stored "this".
10:43 @ajpiano: giampaolo, so if the request was done before, you want to cache it?
10:43  giampaolo: yes
10:43 @ajpiano: there is a jquery ui autocomplete demo that should demonstrate this well for you
10:44 @ajpiano: giampaolo http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
10:44 @ajpiano: you essentially use the request term as a key in an object
10:44 @ajpiano: and as part of the function, you check the cache to see if the json has been stored there, if not, do ajax and store it
10:45  Vorspire: bbq has a good example for caching too
10:47  giampaolo: Vorspire: bbq?
10:47  Vorspire: ?bbq
10:47  bot-t: BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event.

10:53  JKarsrud: Wow, shit happens while you're at the dentist. My company launched the new site today: Yay! http://www.okb.no/
10:54  doonie: not bad jk
10:54  doonie: about us is missing images to the right imo
10:55  JKarsrud: I know :(
10:55  PeterB: With the Autocomplete widget, is it possible to rename the 'label' and 'value' keys? They're making the lookup file much larger than necessary
10:55  JKarsrud: I'm not dealing with it, the guy responsible knows :(
10:55  doonie: eek data:image ;D hopefully they made some kind of ie support
10:55  JKarsrud: But you should see the old one. I've been ashamed to show it :P
10:55  doonie: hehehe
10:55  doonie: nice to see html5
10:55  JKarsrud: doonie: Yeah, IE has fallbacks to regular png's
10:56  JKarsrud: next step is to make that damn scroller on the front page a widget :P
10:56  doonie: hehe
10:57  JKarsrud: Okay, so the site is not completely done, it seems :P
10:58  JKarsrud: I guess he pushed it out so the boss would be happy :P
10:59  Vorspire: it's still pretty good
10:59  Vorspire: a good website is always under construction
10:59  JKarsrud: Yeah, it's just content etc. that's not complete all the way
11:02  doonie: now brade me! http://beta.kafic.net
11:02  doonie: grade not brade ;> ew
11:02  tsyrak: guys, the api doc says: "the $.param() method serializes deep objects recursively to accommodate modern scripting languages and frameworks such as PHP"
11:03  tsyrak: does anyone have any such example?
11:03  tsyrak: because i'm struggling to get that data in usage format in php
11:04  Vorspire: the cute thing is that php has json functions (encode/decode) so just use them if possible?
11:05  blackspotwiggins: tsyrak, it's http serialization
11:05  blackspotwiggins: if you have a decent backend it should automatically get parsed to hashes/arrays
11:05  tsyrak: i'm using php 5
11:05  tsyrak: well it does not
11:06  blackspotwiggins: php 5 is a language not a framework
11:07  giampaolo: ok I've found another way to deal with the json: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307786/   this code is supposed to cache the request so that the json is retrieved only once but it doesn't work: it's still not cached
11:08  juha_: ugh, last couple of weeks i've been wishing that i would be a front-end developer..
11:08  tsyrak: i'm coding everything myself for now, no framework
11:08  JKarsrud: doonie: Your site looks good too :)
11:08  JKarsrud: Different style tho :)
11:08  blackspotwiggins: juha_, i thought you were frontend?
11:08  juha_: blackspotwiggins: all around guy basically
11:09  juha_: lately it's been more about the backend stuff

12:16  bja: mekwall: overpopulation in nature isn't shown until the species experiences a drastic drop in population due to the species overuse of a particular resource (usually food)
12:16  tsyrak: guys, after encoding data through the use of jQuery.param, i do a urldecode in PHP and get this:a[one]=1&a[two]=2&a[three]=3&b[]=1&b[]=2&b[]=3 Anyone knows how to turn that into a PHP variabl or object?
12:16  okaycool: what exactly this is $("li a")[0].nextSibling.nodeValue , I cant find any document for that nextSibling.nodeValue

12:31  bja: is a load event fired when a new element is created after the page has loaded?
12:32  bja: i.e. after $('body').append("<p>HI</p>");
12:32  blackspotwiggins: bja, no
12:32  blackspotwiggins: only when a resource is loaded from cache/network
12:32  bja: is there some event that will get called on new element creation?
12:32  blackspotwiggins: image or similar
12:33  blackspotwiggins: there are dom mutation events
12:33  blackspotwiggins: but when you are doing .append() you practically have that very event there

12:35  okaycool: the each() documentation is confusing me. If I have to iterate over all <li> inside my #list how do I ?
12:35  bja: otherwise I'd just do it on creation where it would normally make sense
12:35  blackspotwiggins: bja, mutation events dont work in ie
12:35  claudio: okaycool: why have you to iterate? (many times the each is useless)
12:36  mekwall: okaycool: $('li').each(function(){ ... });
12:36  okaycool: I was looking at the wrong doc page,

12:37  blackspotwiggins: kk, np then
12:38  mekwall: bja: you mean you've decided to give up on the people still using IE
12:38  mekwall: because I am pretty sure you gave up on IE long before today :)

12:54  johnline: but thanks, i realise now this is probably the pager func generating these
12:55  alaing_away: _nix00 replace the href to #
12:55  _nix00: alaing_away: the only way ?
12:56  alaing_away: _nix00: well whats the point of having links that take you to a bookmark is you disable the functionality

12:57  _nix00: I make a menu, the menu is too high, when I click it to jump, the browser always scroll.

13:02  alaing_away: JKarsrud: why?

13:43 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, $(".foo #bar") isn't a magical lookup that is free
13:43 @ajpiano: it is an operation, a potentially complexone
13:43 @ajpiano: where you are querying the dom
13:43 @ajpiano: if you do that over and over and over again
13:43 @ajpiano: especially using not-so-great selector patterns like an id nested in a class
13:43  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: Hmm, I tried using firebug, caught nothing.
13:43 @ajpiano: it's just a lot of expensive operations for absolutely no reason
13:44 @ajpiano: it's impossible that you could have learned what you needed to learn about using fireubg in the last two minutes
13:45 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, if you have an id on element, $("#foo") should always be an adequate selector, IDs are unique.
13:45  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: As in, when I try to click the submit button. Firebug shows no javascript watch thing. Nothing changed.
13:45 @ajpiano: right
13:46 @ajpiano: you relaise there is a middle ground between "it works" and "it doesn't work" right
13:46 @ajpiano: and that you can debug to inspect what is going wrong

13:50  omfgitsasalmon: My class don't teach jQuery, It's a php class so my facilitator knows nothing about jQuery.
13:51 @ajpiano: hm
13:51  nuaie: basically it should be fonding a parent then find next img, but that find didn't work
13:51  blackspotwiggins: nuaie, $(this).parent().next().find("img") ?
13:51 @ajpiano: well, omfgitsasalmon, don't you think it makes more sense to handle a "Form submit" in the submit event of a form, rahter than in a bunch of click handlers on buttons in the form?
13:51  nuaie: doesn't next find next sibling?
13:52  eightfold: can i use mutiple selectors with "OR"? i know i could do ('.class1.class2') to select all all elements that have class1 AND class2. i want class1 OR class2

13:52  omfgitsasalmon: Moreover, the email regex seems to work, I see no reason why phone shouldn't work too =/
13:52  omfgitsasalmon: Or is it that it can only work for 1 at a time?
13:52  blackspotwiggins: eightfold,  ".class1, .class2"
13:53  nuaie: blackspotwiggins, no i want to find <li this is parent><a><img this is what i want to find>
13:53 @ajpiano: huh?
13:53 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, only one regex can work at a time?
13:53  nuaie: thats not a sibling to li
13:53  eightfold: brainfart, that's basic css :) sorry
13:53  blackspotwiggins: nuaie, paste your html structure
13:53  Aamir: nuaie:  $('li').find('img') ?
13:54  nuaie: i'm trying to do this  <li><a><img></a><p></p><img by clicking this makes previous img dissapear></li>
13:54  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: As in, only one of that same jQuery line can work at the same time? Because the email check works, I just duplicate it and change the regex for phone numbers.
13:54 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, that's not the problem at all
13:54  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: Oh sorry, the link to the other page that I'm working on for the validation is at register.php
13:54 @ajpiano: the problem is that the code is not executing at all.
13:54  nuaie: Aamir, i tried that but no luck
13:54  blackspotwiggins: nuaie, so really you want previous not next?
13:54  omfgitsasalmon: But after implementing that on register.php, the login form in my index.php stopped working.
13:54  blackspotwiggins: nuaie, $(this).prevAll("img").hide()

13:55  blackspotwiggins: no wait
13:55  nuaie: lemme try that
13:55  Aamir: nuaie: $('li').find('img:last') ?
13:55 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, if you would set a breakpoint on the checkForm function, you'd see that it is simply not executing
13:55  blackspotwiggins: .prevAll("a").find("img").hide()
13:56  nuaie: lemme try
13:57  stvs: Does anyone know how to retrieve a hash for an object instance
13:57  mekwall: boom!
13:57  stvs: Any hash at all, something relatively, but not necessarily unique per instance
13:57  blackspotwiggins: stvs, for checking equality ?
13:57  blackspotwiggins: === should work for that
13:58  stvs: blackspotwiggins, I need to quickly find an object reference in a list of object. right now I loop every item and use ===
13:58  stvs: I want a more direct/faster way to verify if I have the object
13:58  blackspotwiggins: ah, you want O(1)
13:58  stvs: Anything less than O(n) :)
13:58  stvs: I could deal with collisions
13:58  stvs: And such
13:58  nuaie: yes, that worked blackspotwiggins
13:59  blackspotwiggins: stvs, there is no builtin easy way to do that
13:59  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: Hmm, I guess I'll give up on that. jQuery really look alien to me. Damn, to think having experience with php and java would give me at least something into it.
13:59  stvs: blackspotwiggins, any blackmagick way :P
13:59  blackspotwiggins: but you could store object type and creation timestamp as semi-unique thing
13:59  stvs: blackspotwiggins, unfortunately the default object.toString is the same for all objects
13:59  blackspotwiggins: or
13:59  blackspotwiggins: hmm
14:00  blackspotwiggins: you could hack valueOf to return someting unique-ish
14:00  stvs: blackspotwiggins, what I do now is store the a little "tag" on the object, object['%tag'] = id
14:00 @ajpiano: omfgitsasalmon, copying a bunch of dubious-quality code from a friend and trying to hack away at it when you have no idea what it's doing or much about DOM scripting in general
14:00 @ajpiano: is not the best way to learn jQuery or JavaScript
14:00  stvs: blackspotwiggins, as I want it to be generic. But I wish I didn't pollute the object
14:00 @ajpiano: if you approach it a litle bit more methodologically, it will make more sense
14:00  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: Haha, true. Well, I guess after my academic year ends. I'll go look for some jQuery/Javascript for dummies.

14:01  markj: bookmark it :]
14:01  blackspotwiggins: and store it
14:01  blackspotwiggins: and return it with valueOf
14:01  blackspotwiggins: altho that could lead to some funky behaviour elsewhere
14:02  omfgitsasalmon: markj: Thanks! Appreciate it.
14:02  blackspotwiggins: anyway store the unique key : object combo in the hash and reference from there
14:03  stvs: blackspotwiggins, that unfortunately assumes I control creation time, but it's for arbitrary objects
14:03  Miika--: how I can dynamically change regex value  ? I have following: //\b(val)\b/gi, but the val should not be string 'val', it should be the contents of var called val
14:03  blackspotwiggins: stvs, you have access to constructor, no?
14:04  blackspotwiggins: Miika--, new Regex()
14:04  stvs: blackspotwiggins, no, the mapping accepts any kind of object, built in, third party or anyhow
14:04  blackspotwiggins: or was it Regexp
14:04  blackspotwiggins: stvs, ah ok
14:04  blackspotwiggins: well, if you want to use anything besides ===
14:05  blackspotwiggins: you have to use something like that
14:05  blackspotwiggins: make a special way of creating said objects
14:07  omfgitsasalmon: ajpiano: Well, changed my approach and use javascript to limit the input to numbers only :)
14:08  omfgitsasalmon: Worked around using that
14:08  Miika--: blackspotwiggins: I'm trying to use that replaceText plugin, that were mentioned earlier
14:13  bja: if I have an Array() stored via .data() and access it with $('foo').data('bar'), is the Array returned the actual array (i.e. I can modify it and the changes are reflected back in a later call to $('foo').data('bar')) or just a copy of that array?

14:51  shivid: i assumme because it is not an object
14:52  shivid: any suggestions?

16:23  blazedd: erichynds: the wierd part is that it works fine on my server, but when I moved it to the client server it bugged.
16:23  erichynds: blazedd, run $.zIndex in console and see if it returns something

16:26  blazedd: latest
16:26  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, with $.proxy maybe

16:29  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: ahh that makes sense what if is within the object itself  myreallyfuckingstupidobjectname what i'm trying to avoid is all the hard coding of the object name if i could have a central point were i could change the name should it need to be changed
16:29  erichynds: blazedd, it's a jquery ui prob
16:30  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, if you store a reference to the root, it doesnt matter what its called
16:30  sean`: this sucks
16:30  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: basically is there some sort of "this" that i could use
16:30  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, this is usually the context of the function
16:31  blazedd: erichynds: I was using 1.8.5 before and it was working, I just had to get a couple new widgets, I'll get an older version and see if that helps. Thansk for your help!
16:31  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: so nothing like it for an object
16:31  erichynds: blazedd, cool, good luck
16:32  Ssmn: Hmmz, how do you refer to a function defined like this: this.function = function() { } from inside that function?
16:33  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, actually, this should be the object
16:33  blazedd: viola! worked like a charm
16:34  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, but if you use the object in functions, this gets overwritten
16:35  JeroenDeDauw: blackspotwiggins: thanks
16:35  blazedd: Ssmn: check this out http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/oriented-programming-1
16:35  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: perhaps I need to do a bit more research. do you know of any good tutorial or resources I could go through?
16:36  timmywil: Ssmn: it will give you undefined if you try to refer to that.
16:36  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, easiest is when you experiment a little with it in jsfiddle
16:37  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: I only just started using it and its much better to work with than loads of anonymous functions for loads of functions filling up a namespace
16:38  blackspotwiggins: alaing_away, i would suggest not nesting too deeply and just referencing the root variable
16:40  alaing_away: blackspotwiggins: thanks for the advice. I'll play around with it in jsfiddle and see if i run into any problems
16:41  alaing_away: is there any kind of code that maps out an object and styles it .

16:47  sean`: they don't do the same
16:48  sean`: .parent () goes to the parent and .siblings () fetches it's siblings
16:48  sean`: it's being the current element
16:48  sean`: set of elements*
16:48  sean`: also makes no sense to use .parent () in thsi case
16:48  AZora: i posted the suggestted code change, again, same result
16:49  orolo: i'm building a string but my links won't work after the string. try clicking on "CRM" and the "google" link: http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~holdman/live/
16:49  Renegade001: Does an a click event, well um, have to events?
16:49  Renegade001: Click and unclick(?)?
16:49  orolo: and i think the culprit is in here: http://jsfiddle.net/s5MrP/
16:50  johnline: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html < :o maybe i need updateactivepagerlink
16:50  RTPMatt: Renegade001: eh, no?  what would unclick do?
16:51  RTPMatt: Renegade001: you mean like mousedown/mouseup?
16:51  Renegade001: Yea, I really don't know but for some reason my .live("click") is being called twice every click
16:51  AZora: sean`: i agree siblings is much more elegant, but i am still not able to narrow the scope of the matched element to the single div's child. it returns all with the same class. I can't seem to find the syntax to get just that one object matched
16:51  megenius: oh, erichynds, i was trying that & it wasn't working & i thought that there's a problem with jQuery itself. now i realized that i need also to bing dragover & dargenter to make the html5 drop event work. thnx :)
16:52  timmywil: renegade001: sounds like a double bind
16:52  sean`: AZora, what are you using now?
16:52  RTPMatt: Renegade001: it shouldn't be, soulds like you have a problem there
16:52  Kambfhase: orolo: well, be returning false you cancle the default action!
16:52  AZora: sean`: i posted the code change you suggested and came up with an equivalent answer
16:52 --- PM|online is now known as PM|offline
16:52  Renegade001: Aha, It is triggering a custom event
16:52  orolo: Kambfhase, i tried that.
16:52  sean`: AZora, you can't answer a simple question?
16:52  Renegade001: .live("click", function() { [trigger event] });
16:53  sean`: or like.. cut and paste a line?
16:53  AZora: siblings, as you suggested
16:53  sean`: good luck then
16:53  AZora: var $this = $(this); 			 $this.siblings ('.selected').css("color","black");
16:53  AZora: it matches all
16:53  sean`: AZora, it will select ALL sibligns of $this
16:53  sean`: siblings*
16:54  sean`: if you want something else, look at next, prev, prevAll, nextAll, nextUntil, prevUntil
16:54  AZora: I am easily able to get .selected to be selected. I am not able to narrow the scope to just the one div and not the entire class .siblings
16:54  AZora: erre .selected sorry
16:55  dipser: does someone know a fallback script for input-pattern (i could use it on html5pattern.com)
16:55  Kambfhase: orolo: how bout removing the return false?
16:55  orolo: Kambfhase, i tried; no effect; i'll update the file.
16:56  orolo: Kambfhase, works on live server!
16:56  orolo: Kambfhase, thanks.
16:56  Kambfhase: :)
16:56  AZora: next works! thank you!
16:58  sickup: anyone use aviaslider?
16:59  johnline: oh thats haw
16:59  johnline: t
17:01  sean`: yeah tis
17:02  SugaSlide: with the whole wiget thing... wheres the best place to put a function i need to call on each option for the select menu?
17:02  SugaSlide: inside _create?
17:02  SugaSlide: or do i do a _myfunction
17:02  Renegade001: Aha, I have found why it's being called twice, this http://pastie.org/1395293
17:02  danheberden: SugaSlide: is it something done when the element is created?
17:02  Renegade001: Well, that's not the exact code but how it works
17:03  SugaSlide: http://pastie.org/1395296
17:03  SugaSlide: danheberden dont think so
17:04  SugaSlide: its a function that gets called while the element is being created
17:04  danheberden: SugaSlide: for the sake of organization, it looks like having it as it's own function but calling it inside of create might make it easier to work with
17:05  SugaSlide: so.. _create()... destroy()... buildoptions()
17:05  SugaSlide: and _init
17:06  WebDragon|away: hey folks
17:06 --- WebDragon|away is now known as WebDragon
17:06  WebDragon: quick question
17:06  WebDragon: have a set of four thumbs which when hovered/clicked show some content
17:07  WebDragon: however if you re-hover/re-click the same element it doesn't 'stay' -- it rehides and reshows the element already being shown. to prevent that I'd add a bit of state-checking, therefore I need to know how to ask jquery whether the item is already visible or not, but there's no isVisible() -- what's the correct jquery equivalent that does what I am describing here ?
17:09  Kambfhase: WebDragon: $().is(':visible')
17:09 * WebDragon facepalms
17:09  WebDragon: I was close :)
17:09  Kambfhase: m(
17:09  WebDragon: close doesn't earn me any cigars though
17:10 --- MrNibblesFreenod is now known as MrNibbles
17:10  Kambfhase: :)
17:11  toastyghost: is there any kind of plugin/workaround that addresses the glitch that happens when you animate opacity on an element that contains a transparent png in ie7/8?
17:11  WebDragon: hmm wait, :visible.. it might make more sense if I did currrent = $("div.hovercontent p:visible).attr("id"); hcontent = $(this).attr("rel"); if (rel != current) { // do the hover state change, otherwise ignore}
17:11  SugaSlide: if i have 2 objects (like in $("<input/>").attr( style stuff... and i want to place both of them inside a div
17:11  SugaSlide: and add it to the dom
17:11  WebDragon: make sense, Kambfhase ?
17:11  SugaSlide: how would i do that?>
17:11  WebDragon: then I don't have to test each p in the div, just find the only one that's actually visible and test that
17:12  WebDragon: if it matches what's being asked for, ignore it
17:13  Kambfhase: WebDragon: try it. but :visible ist a valid QSA Selector so that might fail.
17:13  WebDragon: O_O
17:14  WebDragon: how does jquery determine whether an item is :visible then, if it's not a valid selector ? X-)
17:14  Kambfhase: SugaSlide: $('<div />').append( input1).append( input2).appendTo( DOMPARENTHERE)
17:14  SugaSlide: cool thanks :P
17:14  Kambfhase: WebDragon: it's Magic!
17:14  SugaSlide: thought there might be a joiner thing
17:15  WebDragon: ZOMG MAGIC
17:15  WebDragon: :)
17:15  toastyghost: the first time i saw jquery i was confused and frightened
17:16  toastyghost: then when i started learning it, i felt like i had power over mere mortals
17:16  toastyghost: and it reminded me of that sufficiently advanced technology quote
17:17  erichynds: toastyghost, no fix for that
17:17  AZora: aside from "I can't do that Dave" he didn't come up with many good lines
17:18  WebDragon: seems to work in Opera
17:19  WebDragon: anyone here with MSIE8 can have a look at http://phantom:review@phantomlab.us/home.php and hover/click the thumbs at the bottom to see whether it retains state and doesn't rehide/show the one already being shown ?
17:19  WebDragon: testing in FF/chrome here now, myself
17:20  sickup: i get a windows security popup in ie8
17:20  Kambfhase: page not found
17:20  WebDragon: IE doesn't grok user/pass in the url
17:20  dabaR: Can you have more than one jQuery(document).ready(...) in one page?
17:20  WebDragon: http://phantomlab.us/home.php  user: phantom, pass: review
17:21  KAACH: dabaR yes
17:21  WebDragon: I knew ONE of them didn't understand that, but couldn't recall whether it was IE or one of the others
17:21  Kambfhase: WebDragon: looks ok to me
17:21  WebDragon: now I can make a note
17:21  dabaR: KAACH: thanks
17:21  sickup: the text that appears on hover doesnt have a background
17:21  WebDragon: Kambfhase: so if you re-hover the same thumb near the footer, it doesn't re-hide and show the content div ?
17:22  WebDragon: sickup: in which ver of IE? there should be a blue-shaded transparent png
17:22  sickup: ie8
17:22  Kambfhase: WebDragon: nope, looks all fine
17:22  Kambfhase: ie8, too
17:22  WebDragon: Kambfhase: are you seeing the same thing sickup is?
17:22  sickup: i see the bg in FF but not ie8
17:22  WebDragon: sickup: thanks for the heads-up :)
17:23  Kambfhase: yep, no bg
17:23  WebDragon: it should bloody work fine. I have the IE9.js thing on there, which should be set to show transparency on png images
17:24  WebDragon: at least I can be sure you're not running with js disabled, there, since the other bits work :D
17:24  WebDragon: hmm wonder what the problem is. that 'fix' has worked for ages
17:24 --- sroussey_ is now known as sroussey
17:24  sickup: what fix
17:25  WebDragon: http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/  with var IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = ".png";
17:25  KAACH: you don't need any fix to have png 24 transparency in ie8...
17:26  sickup: lol
17:26  WebDragon: it's there for versions lower than IE8
17:27  WebDragon: it also is there to fix a number of things that they still don't get right
17:27  WebDragon: png transparency is just a side-benefit
17:27  WebDragon: good to know that it's fixed in IE8 though
17:27  User949: hey all i was just in the javascript channel and they told me to ask here if anyone knows how to get load to work with ie6
17:27  sickup: are you targetting ie for css purposes?
17:27  WebDragon: half a moment while I adjust
17:27 --- ocf is now known as Guest83226
17:27  KAACH: it's fixed in ie7 too
17:28  KAACH: only ie6 doesn't support it
17:29  SugaSlide: dytrivedi lol at twitter :P
17:29  dytrivedi: SugaSlide: sup
17:29  dytrivedi: long time no see
17:29  SugaSlide: yeah :D
17:29  dytrivedi: :D
17:29  User949: my load call works for ie7+ chrome, firefox and safari just not ie6
17:29  SugaSlide: did you get the job?
17:29  dytrivedi: ?weather SugaSlide
17:29  bot-t: dytrivedi, No results found for 'SugaSlide'.
17:29  dytrivedi: aww
17:29  User949: anywone know a work around
17:29  dytrivedi: SugaSlide: in the process
17:29  dytrivedi: that's what's making me crazy
17:29  SugaSlide: :/
17:30  SugaSlide: yeah
17:30  WebDragon: try reloading now. I set the var to only be in effect for IE6
17:30  SugaSlide: same here... mine only might happen 1st march
17:30  SugaSlide: ive been grumpy for the past month hehe
17:30  WebDragon: if what you're saying is true, you should now see the normal transparent png image behind the div that shows when the thumbs at the bottom are hovered
17:31  fwaokda: I'm trying to get the div I click to animate slowly to the top left of my parent div. I'm using this but it's not working anyone know why? http://pastebin.com/u55pKm9P  -- It's relocating to the correct position but it's doing it very abruptly
17:31  sickup: <WebDragon> try reloading now. I set the var to only be in effect for IE6
17:31  sickup: fixed in ie8
17:32  SugaSlide: hmm
17:32  WebDragon: sickup: to answer your question from before, yes, I am using the IE9.js to target IE for css purposes and get a number of fixes in there so that I can write css as it's meant to be written mostly :)
17:32  WebDragon: things like div > p:first-child
17:32  sickup: ya stuff like that you dont need a plugin for
17:32 --- dytrivedi_ is now known as dytrivedi
17:32  WebDragon: or table td + td
17:33  SugaSlide: seutje i suspect... the speed of the line will play a massive role in that
17:33  WebDragon: well the > and + selectors you do
17:33  SugaSlide: and how fast you can talk :P
17:33  SugaSlide: "google how do i deploy my parac... splat"
17:33  dytrivedi: Lampoon: seen seutje
17:33  Lampoon: seutje was last seen in #jquery 19 hours 29 min ago saying 'thx for clearing that up mekwall <3'.
17:33  WebDragon: not sure about 7 or 8 but I'm totally certain ie6 needs 'em
17:33  dytrivedi: SugaSlide: xD
17:33 * mekwall slaps dytrivedi 
17:33  WebDragon: it's progressive, applying the fixes only as needed depending on the IE version being used
17:34  sickup: i prefer to use snippets ive built to target these things rather than have a plugin you wont use 100% of its abilities
17:34  WebDragon: works pretty dam well too
17:34  SugaSlide: dytrivedi new cv look share share!!!
17:34  mekwall: dytrivedi: your fault that my nick was highlighted! :)
17:34  dytrivedi: haha
17:34  SugaSlide: mekwall you're so awesome your name comes up when you seen somone else :P

17:34  WebDragon: sickup: but thanks for checking for me
17:34  SugaSlide: time to rape ideas :P
17:35  mekwall: SugaSlide: hehe, or it just proves I'm the übernerd of this channel
17:35  dytrivedi: :p
17:35  WebDragon: and for the heads-up on the trans not working :)
17:35  sickup: oh did write the plugin?
17:35  sickup: oh did you write the plugin?
17:35  mekwall: dytrivedi: so many symbols, so little time...
17:35 * WebDragon slides a cuppa DragonCoffee™ over to sickup and Kambfhase 
17:35  SugaSlide: whoa dytrivedi........... thats a huge change!!!
17:35  dytrivedi: ghehe
17:36  Kambfhase: thanks, i am done with coffee for today
17:36  WebDragon: sickup: no it was originall done by Dean Edwards.. no idea if he's still the sole lead on it, now that it's at googlecode
17:36  WebDragon: originally*
17:36  sickup: well ive just tested your site in ie6 and its busted so not sure what this plugin achieves right now ;P
17:36  mekwall: dytrivedi: Trivedi sounds italian
17:36  WebDragon: sickup: what's busted
17:36  WebDragon: sickup: I haven't myself tested in IE6 yet
17:36  WebDragon: sickup: that's next :)
17:36  dytrivedi: hmm but I'm like, an Indian
17:36  mekwall: yeah I read that

17:37  WebDragon: sickup: LOL fair enough
17:37  seutje: SugaSlide: whaaa?
17:37  mekwall: dytrivedi: How can one be a hacker and mac-crazy at the same time?
17:37  WebDragon: well thanks for the help :)
17:37 * dytrivedi runs chanserv as an administrator
17:37  l4rk: mekwall: when one is a hacker who uses a mac
17:37  sickup: just saying i dont understand why your changes the plugin to target ie6 only now and its not fixed anything
17:37 * WebDragon gets back to the next steps on development leaving IE6 to gather some more dust while I flesh out the additional pages 
17:37  SugaSlide: seutje the tweet bout google voice :P

17:37  dytrivedi: I USE hackintosh!!!
17:37  WebDragon: sickup: that's mostly due to browser-bugs not the css fixes that it applies

17:38  dytrivedi: totally
17:38  l4rk: toastyghost: huge issues with that in IE

17:39  toastyghost: hm
17:39  WebDragon: toastyghost: wait, it's still fubared in IE8 ?

17:40  mekwall: l4rk, dytrivedi... I've owned a mac pro, mac book pro and an iphone... a couple of years back I decided to never head back down that road again :)
17:40  WebDragon: it's their own damn fault for putting up with MS's slacking for this long
17:40  l4rk: mekwall: i use linux at work and i game on windows, i use os x for most of my at home development
17:40  WebDragon: that and being clueless about browser support for web standards

17:40  SugaSlide: LOL
17:40  mekwall: I hate mac for what it did to my soul :(
17:40  dytrivedi: and everything else is hacked inside ;-)
17:40  WebDragon: and OUR fault as developers for pandering to its deficiencies for so damn long

17:41  dytrivedi: exactly
17:41  dytrivedi: and how do you program for mac? Obj-C
17:41  mekwall: l4rk: I guess you and dytrivedi are immune to jobso

18:11  erichynds: mekwall yeah true
18:11  erichynds: d3lud3d`, ur jsons are invalid

18:12  d3lud3d`: obvious i have code inside the function
18:12  lonimurar: Kambfhase: this is in $('div.foobar').click(function() {});
18:12  erichynds: run the response through jsonlint.com d3lud3d`

18:15  d3lud3d`: my other json, which is structure the same works tho
18:15  erichynds: or have line breaks
18:15  d3lud3d`: thats the puzzling thing

18:16  schweizer: without the dummy element i mean
18:16  mekwall: d3lud3d`: single quotes aren't valid json
18:16  erichynds: d3lud3d`, keys must be in double quotes; you're using an = instead of :
18:16  d3lud3d`: not really, i just learn to use it that way
18:16  timmywil: d3lud3d`: equal signs?
18:16  d3lud3d`: as my original need for it was cross server
18:17  erichynds: you should be using something to generate your json rather than doing it by hand
18:17  d3lud3d`: DOH
18:17  d3lud3d`: its colons isnt it haha
18:17  mekwall: yes
18:17  mekwall: $.getJSON('ajax/contact.send.php', { from: from, subject: subject, message: message, callback: '?' }, function(data) { });
18:17  mekwall: also, that is how you should send data
18:18  mekwall: but we still don't know why you are using jsonp
18:18  Kambfhase: schweizer: no, unless you create the text node by hand
18:18  d3lud3d`: would that come to my other script as a post, or as a get
18:18  d3lud3d`: as its dynamically created by php
18:19  mekwall: schweizer: $('<div>', { text: 'This is fun & stuff' }).html()
18:19  mekwall: that's a tad shorter :P
18:19  Kambfhase: nope, its not.
18:20  mekwall: schweizer: but you'd be better off with $('<div>This is fun & stuff</div>').html();

19:20  flayks: "bizarre" ? a french ? :p
19:21  mekwall: Typh_: it's not... it's a bug
19:21  mekwall: Typh_: can be checked with $.support.hrefNormalized
19:21  mekwall: Typh_: you'd have to remove the baseurl
19:21  dpham: im trying to toggle an icon when a user clicks on a list item. it seems like a simple problem but i can't seem to get it to work. the console displays no errors. can somebody help me debug this, this is what i have so far: http://pastie.org/1395671
19:22  mekwall: Typh_: var baseUrl = window.location.href.substring(0, window.location.href.lastIndexOf("/") + 1); var url = href.replace(baseUrl, "");
19:22  mekwall: Typh_: I guess one of the sites is running in compatibility mode, yes?
19:22  mekwall: if so, it uses IE7 rendering engine
19:23  Typh_: mekwall: hmmm, I'll check.
19:24  mekwall: Typh_: add the following meta tag to your sites and you won't run into that problem in IE8... <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8" />
19:24  Typh_: neither one seems to be in compatibility mode.
19:25  mekwall: compability mode should really be called defunct mode :)
19:25  mekwall: Typh_: well it's obvious that you've run into normalized href, which is typical IE7 behavior
19:25  m0dmd: sup everyone. hope you're all well.
19:26  mekwall: Typh_: just check what $.support.hrefNormalized returns
19:26 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
19:27  Typh_: mekwall: false in the messed up site. huh.
19:28  Typh_: OH compatibility mode. Like in the browser.
19:28  mekwall: flayks: actually bizarre originates from the basque regions of spain :)
19:28  Typh_: I will check, and likely slap the developer in the head :D
19:28  flayks: mekwall: ha... happy to learn that :p
19:28  mekwall: flayks: it's bizarre, I know
19:29  mekwall: Typh_: so you're blaming this on someone else? :D
19:30  Typh_: mekwall: the compatibility mode part, yes :), I'm not the one testing. Mind you, it never even occured to me to check.
19:31  Typh_: thank you very much.
19:31  mekwall: Typh_: np :)
19:31  mekwall: Typh_: I usually forget to check that as well.... but you can compare compatibility mode in IE8 with the power cable... always check that first lol
19:32  gooddesignusa: i never use this type of selector and I know its changed from jquery 1.2.3 to the newer version. How would I go about selecting different IDs that have the prefix of edit-field-permission-value-   everything after that could be different

19:52  erichynds: SugaSlide, from within the widget or outside of it?

19:53  timmywil: moke: put the set Interval inside the document ready
19:53  timmywil: after you create the progressbar

19:54  SugaSlide: :D

19:54  SugaSlide: lol it works
19:54  moke: the set intervol isnt the problem

19:55  Pilate: d^mien: whats the typeof data?
19:55  moke: its just plane text, number that is loaded form the page @ pilate
19:55  Pilate: so its a string instead of a number?
19:55  moke: here: http://pastebin.com/SnZrvhB7
19:55  moke: it prints out a number between 1 and 100
19:56  Pilate: i know moke, ive seen that, that doesnt answer the question

19:56  Pilate: well then, there you go

19:57  Trisox: lets say set the mediaquerie to portrait
19:58  moke: so why doesnt it update the progress bar?

19:58  gooddesignusa: is there anything like parentsUntil in jquery 1.3.2

20:00  erichynds: i'm willing to bet jquery ui type casts it anyway
20:00 @ajpiano: gooddesignusa, there's still parents and closest

20:10  JuJuBee: ajpiano: thanks, didn't see that.
20:10 @ajpiano: carpet_the_walls, the best thing to do is to download the pacakage
20:10  JuJuBee: Fresh eyes always help.
20:10 @ajpiano: and then make any rule modifications in an external stylesheet
20:10 @ajpiano: so does jslint ;)
20:11 @ajpiano: carpet_the_walls, by making the changes in an external stylesheet, you ensure that you can go back to themeroller and regenerate your theme as newer versions come out
20:11  carpet_the_walls: ajpiano: using important! ?
20:11 @ajpiano: and that you won't then have to go make those tweaks again in the generated stylsheets

20:11 @ajpiano: carpet_the_walls: if it's needed
20:12 @ajpiano: a lot of the overrides i needed were context specific

20:14  erichynds: jsidhu, just rip the regex out of it

20:18 @ajpiano: TheoMurpse, you need double quotes in json, not singles
20:18 @ajpiano: TheoMurpse, did you handwrite that json
20:18 @ajpiano: ?
20:19  TheoMurpse: ajpiano: I have PHP generating it. I dont' have PHP 5.2, so I can't use the built in JSON stuff, and I don't have control over the server, so I can't upgrade or install the JSON extension.
20:19 @ajpiano: you should always let whatever language you're using handle JSON serialization, if it is at all possible
20:19 @ajpiano: ga
20:19 @ajpiano: that's kind of absurd :/
20:19  prgmrBill: there are functions on the manual page to replace jsoN_encode if you don't have it yet
20:19  prgmrBill: as there are with most functions
20:19 @ajpiano: handwriting JSON is a fool's errand
20:19 @ajpiano: not insulting you ... just that it is inherently error prone
20:20  TheoMurpse: Thanks for the note about using double quotes. Why does it matter? It's just a JS array, isn't it?
20:20 @ajpiano: it matters because that's how it has to be
20:21 @ajpiano: no, it is a string representation of an object/array
20:21 @ajpiano: and there is a spec for it

20:25  Renegade001: Is it possible to record how many times a function has been called?
20:25  SugaSlide: var i = 0
20:25  SugaSlide: i++
20:25 @ajpiano: Renegade001, yes, you can store a property on the function
20:25  SugaSlide: inside the function
20:25  SugaSlide: or that
20:26  Renegade001: But will it not reset every time the function is called?

20:27  erichynds: couldn't do you foo.count = foo.count || 1;
20:27  erichynds: ++foo.count that is
20:27  AdamDV: Can I do this? if ($('#password_box').length<5)    { alert("bla"); } ?
20:27 @ajpiano: ?eval function foo() {  foo.count = ++foo.count || 1  }; foo(); foo(); foo(); foo.count
20:27  bot-t: ajpiano: 3 (Process Killed)
20:28  erichynds: process killed?
20:28 @ajpiano: i'm suspicious of it
20:28 @ajpiano: cause if it's undefined, it'll screw up incrementing it
20:28  TheoMurpse: ajpiano: erichynds I think it's because the pre-increment of a non-existent variable
20:28 @ajpiano: that's what i was suspicious of
20:28  erichynds: it doesn't hit the increment though
20:29  erichynds: rite?
20:29  TheoMurpse: I think foo.count++ might actually work because it won't try to increment a nonexistent variable.
20:29  ow1n: Trying to do a UI Autocomplete. Anyone know why Firebug would report 200 OK but an empty response? Testing the GET URL directly gives me data
20:29 @ajpiano: the other simple solution is just...
20:29  erichynds: oh, i see now, you're right
20:29  TheoMurpse: It will fail the first part of the or, set foo.count equal to 1. Then it won't increment since foo.count++ failed and was skiped over. The ternary operator is so much nicer, though ;)
20:30 @ajpiano: ?eval function foo() {  foo.count++ }; foo.count = 0; foo(); foo(); foo(); foo.count

20:33 @ajpiano: jsidhu, do you have console.log calls in the code?

20:51 @ajpiano: queso, there, in fact
20:51 @ajpiano: you have to use a couple of the event handlers together, i did it once in a fiddle but no idea where it is :/
20:51 @ajpiano: if i hav a couple minutes i'll work it up for you again
20:51  queso: ajpiano: great, thank you, would appreciate that.  perhaps that could be made an option in a future release.
20:52 @ajpiano: nope...
20:52 @ajpiano: the point of autocomplete is to make it lean and expose options

20:53 @ajpiano: ocf, you can detect which event.type is hapening
20:53 @ajpiano: Ssmn, you want it to recurse, using a timeout inbetween though, i assume?
20:53  Ssmn: yes :P
20:54  sean`: (function foo () { /* do something */ setTimeout (foo, 300); })();
20:54 @ajpiano: ^^
20:54  timmywil: delinquentme, you need a jQuery selection $('body').html(Quotation[whichQuotation])
20:54  Ssmn: sean, in oop syntax :P, not procedural :P
20:55  Ssmn: hmmmm

22:58  mekwall: well, if you want the money to work for you and not the other way around
22:58  Tallisman: well.. let's say it this way.. i would be just as happy with 20.000 as with 1.000.000.000 :P
22:58  johnp_: Hrm. This is so strange. I literally have nothing on this page but jQuery and an image that doesn't exist and it's consistently hit twice. Baffled.
22:58  mekwall: haha
22:59  Tallisman: no clue what the heck i would want to do with a billion..
22:59  Tallisman: buy a cool house - 1 million
22:59  mekwall: if I won a billion I would buy my own island P
22:59  Tallisman: buy some cool electronics - 50.000
22:59  Abbas-: a billion?
22:59  Abbas-: thats too easy to spend
22:59  mekwall: ofc it's easy to spend it
23:00  Abbas-: heck, my top fav cars are gonna eat up a good junk of that
23:00  Tallisman: i would place the rest on a couple of banks and live from the rent.
23:00  Abbas-: then 2,3 fav plans
23:00  Abbas-: anotehr 10-20%
23:00  mekwall: a trip to the moon, 1 billion
23:00 --- kal-EL__ is now known as kal-EL_
23:00  Abbas-: a few villas and mansions arond the world
23:00  Abbas-: nah, forget trip to the moon
23:00  Abbas-: its already been done
23:00  Abbas-: i mean i wouldn't spend my billion dollar on it
23:00  mekwall: but have YOU been there?
23:00  Abbas-: unless iw as the first one
23:00  Tallisman: i would start my own space company.. O.o
23:00  mekwall: mars then :P
23:00  Abbas-: yea
23:01  Abbas-: mars
23:01  mekwall: it would probably cost as much
23:01  Abbas-: is gg
23:01  Abbas-: but
23:01  Abbas-: again
23:01  Abbas-: i wouldn't be a lab rat for a 9 months space travel
23:01  Abbas-: not alone and not with anyone else :O
23:01  mekwall: Abbas: function (event) { if (event.which == 13) { return false; } }
23:02  RTPMatt:  johnp_: it still does it when you remove jquery?
23:02  johnp_: Nope.
23:02  johnp_: https://gist.github.com/750695
23:02  Abbas-: 13 .. erm . .. ?
23:02  johnp_: It happens with this markup snippet -- *intermittently*!
23:02  RTPMatt: er, yeah, thats what i meant
23:02  mekwall: Abbas-: well
23:02  mekwall: Abbas-: stop
23:02  mekwall: Abbas-: the enter
23:02  mekwall: Abbas-: hammering :p
23:02  Tallisman: maybe i would hire some awsome programmers and make one awsome opensource program..
23:03  johnp_: RTPMatt - Sorry, no, the behavior disappears when I remove jQuery
23:03  mekwall: Abbas-: I was hoping you'd get the fun in that ;)
23:03  RTPMatt: yeah, that what i was trying to say
23:03  Abbas-: for $1billion Tallisman, hm, i say, work on producing cheap energy
23:03  Abbas-: thats the best thing you can do for mankind
23:03  Abbas-: everything will become affordable. food , medicne
23:03  Abbas-: its all attached to cheap energy
23:03  mekwall: or just kill off all the americans...
23:03  Abbas-: look at the morons controlign our life strings
23:03  Abbas-: with all those petrol prices
23:03  mekwall: but that wouldn't be politically correct
23:03  RTPMatt: johnp_: as far as I know it should not be doing anything
23:03  Abbas-: some sheikh in saudia incrases oil prices
23:03  Tallisman: also good one :P, you could also invest in building better electronic cars
23:04  Abbas-: and all of a sudden my pay is 33% less useful
23:04  mekwall: you know what... I pay €30 every month for public transportation :)
23:04  Abbas-: well
23:05  Abbas-: u pay much more for transporatin ;p
23:05  Tallisman: mekwall, where do you live!?
23:05  Abbas-: when you pay $10 for soemthing, you could've wait $7 for
23:05  Tallisman: i travel 20km a day, it costs me 112 euro a month! :O
23:05  Abbas-: basically, i believe, we could make everyone's life better
23:05  Abbas-: when we bring down eenrgy costs
23:05  Abbas-: upto , may be 70%
23:05  mekwall: Tallisman: Sweden
23:06  Tallisman: i now am so going to sweden on vacation.
23:06  mekwall: Public Transportation is great, but it's not as convenient as taking the car ofc
23:06  Tallisman: just getting on a train..
23:06  mekwall: and right now, when it's snowing.... not so good :p
23:06  Tallisman: travel 3 days in that trains..
23:06  Tallisman: 3 days in the train without getting out :P
23:06  mekwall: Tallisman: that would cost more then €30 though :p
23:07  Tallisman: i heard that certain tracks can be a really cheap hotel :P
23:07  mekwall: what I pay for is just for the local city (though second largest in Sweden)
23:07  mekwall: yeah that's true
23:07  mekwall: if you travel north
23:07  ajpiano: gah
23:07  ajpiano: monthly metrocard is going up to $102
23:08  mekwall: omg :D
23:08  Tallisman: it is funny, cause trains in sweden have wireless internet, heard that.
23:08  mekwall: that's expensive
23:08  ajpiano: hup, i mean 104!
23:08  ajpiano: $15 increaase :/
23:08  Ryro: thats called inflation
23:08  ajpiano: 3 fare hikes in 2 yrs
23:08  Abbas-: see mewall

23:08  ajpiano: ENJOY YOUR SOCIALISM
23:08  danheberden: ajpiano: damn dude
23:08  Abbas-: $15 incrase in travel costs of thousands of ppl
23:09  Abbas-: that is why we need cheap energy
23:09  Abbas-: so they don't complain about fuel prices
23:09  Tallisman: btw, guys, how do you like the snow (i heard it is globally..)
23:09  Abbas-: and don tkeep increase fare
23:09  danheberden: ajpiano: and it's not like the quality is increasingly stellar
23:09  Tallisman: well, in europe everything is white..
23:09  mekwall: Abbas-: ofc... clean and free energy for everyone would be a life savior
23:09  Ryro: we've gotten 6 inches today
23:09  mekwall: http://www.steorn.com/
23:09  mekwall: \o/
23:10  mekwall: I wonder what's happening with them :P
23:10  Tallisman: nice :), i must say i am getting sick of the snow :P
23:10  Tallisman: i live in the netherlands, there isn't supposed to be any snow here
23:10  Tallisman: now the roads are snowed under.. 50km/h on the highway yay :D
23:11  Abbas-: is it good or b ad to have snow?
23:11  Abbas-: caz we dont get it ever :s
23:11  Abbas-: sux2live on dEquator
23:11  mekwall: Tallisman: "supposed to be" is kinda stupid :P
23:11  Tallisman: it is good for the first week :P
23:11  Abbas-: o, like marriages
23:11  Tallisman: after that you get sick of it, transportation is so much harder :P
23:12  mekwall: humans have lived on this rock a couple of hundred thousand years, and our weather stats date back a couple of hundred
23:12  Ryro: at least it'll be a white christmas?
23:12  Abbas-: like marraiges
23:12  Tallisman: trains have huge delays, cars travel with 50% effectiveness, cycling is slipping..
23:12  mekwall: weather stats mean crap, especially now when we're entering a new age
23:12  Tallisman: i once heard about a thing called global warming..\
23:13  Tallisman: think it was a hoax though :)
23:13  mekwall: I think we should accustom to it not working as it did 20-50 years ago :P
23:13  mekwall: because it will only get worse
23:13  Tallisman: none dares to speak about it these days xD
23:13  mekwall: global warming is the least of our worries
23:13  Tallisman: global warming means - global snow.
23:14  Tallisman: we know when we screwed it when it snows in the sahara.
23:14  Abbas-: and Tsunamis
23:14  Abbas-: when it snows here
23:14  Abbas-: that'll be the end of it
23:14  Abbas-: i'll let you guys know
23:14  Abbas-: when it does
23:14  mekwall: next year or so :P
23:15  Abbas-: are you saying, i'll die a virgin?
23:15  Tallisman: i took peace with that years ago :D xD
23:16  mekwall: Abbas-: you do have a whole year to get rid of that :P

23:20  mekwall: sean`: that should be watched by everyone
23:20  Tallisman: are you some kind of reversed player type?
23:20  Tallisman: :]
23:20  mekwall: reversed? :D
23:20  ningia: anyone know a way to that smartly? $("#myid").val($("#myid").val()+1)
23:20  ningia: *to do
23:21  Tallisman: yea you're here right.. that must mean something..
23:21  sean`: this.value += 1
23:21  mekwall: Tallisman: lol
23:21  Tallisman: this channel doesn't seem like a colaboration channel for players xD
23:21  Tallisman: or is it.. just kidding :P
23:21  mekwall: Tallisman: I'm no player nor a pua :)
23:21  sean`: ningia, you need to parse int it
23:22  Tallisman: =)
23:22  sean`: ningia, http://jsfiddle.net/NfdmC/
23:22  mekwall: Tallisman: I'm way too intellectual to like that kind of stuff
23:22  mekwall: I think too much :)
23:23  Tallisman: well, seems like when you were 14, things were different, how old are you now?
23:23  mekwall: about double that age
23:23  flayks: heyp
23:23  Tallisman: ah, 1982?
23:23  ningia: uhm... I've not "this", but a jquery element..
23:23  mekwall: early 83 to be precise
23:23  flayks: how can i get the class of all #sort .option a ?
23:23  flayks: (class1, class2, class3, etc)
23:24  Tallisman: i think you are about 10 years older than me :)
23:24  mekwall: eh?
23:24  mekwall: I'm getting old :/
23:24  Tallisman: which is good, cause i feel young again :p
23:24  mekwall: It's depressing. Might just go play WoW again hehe
23:24  ianl`: 8)
23:25  Tallisman: hahaha, WoW, a game which time has ended :)
23:25  ningia: flayks: do you mean something like that? $("#sort .option a").each(function(){$(this).class();});
23:25  flayks: ningia: hm yes... maybe, simply :(
23:25  flayks: i test it
23:25  sean`: Vorspire, ping
23:26  Tallisman: funny though, once runescape was 'the shit', after that it was word of warcraft.. etcetra :P
23:26  mekwall: Tallisman: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCEQ1XXZTyI
23:26  mekwall: :D

23:31  Tallisman: you killed me mekwall!
23:31  Tallisman: murderer!
23:32  flayks: ningia: i don't view your modifications
23:32  flayks: see*
23:33  ningia: flayks: classes in the cycle are ok or what?
23:33  ningia: if you want all the classes in an array outside the function... humm... needs some variable scope...
23:33  ningia: but not impossible
23:34  flayks: ningia: just get the class of each .option link ;)
23:35  mekwall: Tallisman: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8rrFP2RMmo&feature=related
23:35  mekwall: Sweden
23:35  mekwall: !
23:35  Tallisman: i am not even done watching the last one :O
23:35  Tallisman: but now i am ^^
23:36  Tallisman: awwh =(
23:36  Tallisman: You need to upgrade your adobe flash player to watch this video =(
23:36  Tallisman: why isn't every video html5 =(
23:37 --- CalebD_ is now known as CalebD
23:39  Tallisman: question - why doesn't youtube simply change to html5 in general :P?
23:40  Tallisman: flash isn't quite as much use if youtube is converted :P
23:40  phantomkiwi: how do you past a string to a selector?
23:40  sean`: $('foo' + bar);
23:40  phantomkiwi: Strange it doesnt work
23:41  Tallisman: it works phantom :P
23:41  sean`: ?eval foo = 'bar'; 'bla ' + bar
23:41  phantomkiwi: $("#ajax-page").load(url +"");
23:41  bot-t: sean`: ReferenceError: bar is not defined
23:41  sean`: ?eval foo = 'bar'; 'bla ' + foo
23:41  bot-t: sean`: "bla bar"
23:41  sean`: phantomkiwi, perhaps url is not what you think it is
23:41  phantomkiwi: when I do $("#" +id doesnt work
23:41  sean`: or it's invalid
23:42  phantomkiwi: the above works but when I do an id doesnt work
23:42  phantomkiwi: didnt want to hard code the ID
23:42  Tallisman: $('#timer' + id).click();
23:42  Tallisman: for example :P
23:42  Tallisman: but the above code works when grabbing stuff like #timer1 (if id == 1)
23:43  phantomkiwi: weird something wrong witht he load then
23:43  eydaimon: https://gist.github.com/f7e556582a0154f4932c <- why would I get the info printd twice with this simple change event listener?
23:44  mekwall: sleepy time
23:45  mekwall: cya
23:45  Tallisman: goodnight mekwall
23:45  phantomkiwi: something really wrong
23:45  phantomkiwi: i did error checkign this works: $('#ajax'+'-page').load(url +"");
23:45  phantomkiwi: when I do var id = '-page'; $('#ajax'+id).load(url +"");
23:46  phantomkiwi: doesnt work
23:46  phantomkiwi: I cant see why it shouldnt
23:46  phantomkiwi: if the top works the bottom should work too
23:49  eighty4: phantomkiwi: that should work yes, jsfiddle the code?
