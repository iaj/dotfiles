12:06  MrNibbles: ok
12:07  denysonique: if it is inserted then it is in the DOM if it has not been inserted it won't be there
12:07  MrNibbles: but that means i have to parse the whole dom structure to do so

12:09  sean`: Northwoods, USE YOUR MAGICAL BRAIN

12:09  denysonique: Damit, it could be anything e.g. search/name of the movie

12:11  MrNibbles: https://gist.github.com/703244

12:11  MrNibbles: but if i do: $('<div/>').is(':onscreen')
12:11  Northwoods: sean`: oh thats more depressing for me  :(
12:11  MrNibbles: it always returns true
12:11  Northwoods: cuz i'm still at 2 %
12:11  MrNibbles: but the element does not yet exist in the dom
12:11  Northwoods: and i'm thinking of quitting programming
12:12  MrNibbles: sean`: perhaps i am not understanding what your saying :(
12:12  sean`: MrNibbles, what do you want to do
12:12  MrNibbles: https://gist.github.com/703244 <-- see there
12:12  MrNibbles: and do: $('<div/>').is(':onscreen')
12:13  MrNibbles: with those selectors
12:13  MrNibbles: it always returns true
12:13  MrNibbles: it works if the elements are in the dom
12:13  MrNibbles: but not if they are created in the collection

12:14  MrNibbles: hehe
12:15  MrNibbles: sorry its a bit fiddly
12:15  MrNibbles: i need to check if the passed in elements are in the dom or not
12:19  MrNibbles: perhaps checking the element has existing parents, and if so, that window is one of them would work

13:38  doonie: ph^ can you show the headers again the same way with the new link
13:38  sean`: (. )( .)
13:38  sean`: (      )
13:40  eightfold: sean`: thanks a lot. so jQuery (function ($){    would actually be a better way to start off then $().ready(function(){   ?
13:40  doonie: | . . . . . c.......... | waka waka waka waka
13:40  ph^: doonie: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/aukbob6yfuxo1myandqq7q
13:40  doonie: ph^ you do see the underline do ya?
13:40  ph^: yes
13:41  sean`: eightfold, you got the message
13:41  doonie: why not make the request to that then
13:41  doonie: /ABB_AS/
13:41  doonie: to skip the forwarder that doesn't include the args
13:41  ph^: doonie: because the request is all about checking if something exists
13:41  doonie: oh, well then the rewrite is to blame
13:42  doonie: if its /ABB_AS/?_=1289997419902 you want to be forwarded to
13:42  ph^: That's not the point, why doesn't jQuery resend the headers when it follows a 301 redirect?
13:43  ph^: I'm aware this might be XHR following the redirect automatically
13:43  doonie: i think its the server that makes the browser get that url
13:43  doonie: which doesn't include the get variables
13:43  doonie: just a hunch
13:44  eightfold: sean`: greatie
13:44  ph^: the get variables are only because of cache: false in jQuery.ajax
13:44  Cork: ph^: get/post is always lost on 301, the the default behavior
13:45  Cork: *thats the
13:45  doonie: depends on the server though
13:45  Cork: ya
13:45  ph^: Cork: I knew the variables were lost, but not the headers
13:45  Cork: ph^: what headers are you refering to?
13:45  ph^: Accept header
13:45  ph^: that's the whole issue here
13:45  Cork: hmm
13:45  ph^: the Accept header changes between the two requests
13:45  Cork: thats strange
13:46  ph^: the first requests asks for json, the second for text/html
13:46  Cork: ph^: does it happen in all browsers?
13:46  ph^: (that is after the redirect it asks for text/html)
13:46  ph^: Cork: firefox and Chrome so far
13:46  Cork: ir chrome/firefox/ie/opera?

13:55  gabriel9: i have one button which do togle
13:56  doonie: nice!
13:56 * doonie steals gabriels button
13:56  gabriel9: hold your horses, i have some problems with typing :D
13:57  gabriel9: i have one button which do toggle, and life is good. but i have one more button for genereal hide when i click him. But when i again click again on first button it does not show. It do hide
13:57  gabriel9: :/ OMG i wrote this like devil itself :D
13:59  gabriel9: button1 toogle(hide/show) button2 just hide, when click on b1 it shows, then b2 hide, then again b1 it does not show it hides(function toggle is continue work)
13:59  doonie: heh
13:59  gabriel9: just need to break that "thread"
14:03  gabriel9: i can just stop using toggle, but that is not fun :)
14:03  philk_: can i prevent buttons from staying in the "active" state after they have been clicked? its anoying
14:03  doonie: disable em
14:04  doonie: or set focus on something else
14:04  Fustrated: ! rawr!  - http://pastebin.com/WtWvzTJ8   - Could someone see how I can make CheckForJs() a dynamic name as well? I got the checker working but I need it to be CheckForJs'+genre+'()
14:04  philk_: doonie: disabling does not remove the active state
14:04  doonie: what about the focus idea
14:05  Fustrated: I tried	function eval('CheckForJs'+genre)() but it says syntax error
14:05  Fustrated: eval('CheckForJs'+genre)(){event}
14:05  philk_: doonie: hmmm then I would have to attach another click event handler to each button?
14:05  doonie: philk_ or call blur on the btn
14:05  doonie: no you can use the one you use
14:06  Cork: Fustrated: window['Proof_' + genre](), why use eval if you don't need to?
14:07  Fustrated: thanks Cork, I'll use that instead, my knowledge of javascript is EXtremly limited
14:07  Clorith: So I'm using jQueryUI (1.8.6 w/ jQuery 1.4.4) with tabs and accordions (I have 4 tabs with multiple accordions under each tab). But only the accordion on the first tab show properly, all others only show the title and the na minimal scroll field for the actual content.
14:08  Cork: Fustrated: btw your creating chekcForJs inside a for loop... but never calls it inside it??
14:08  aidan: How do I load jqueryui using google's CDN? do they just host the main ui file? How would i use say the button framework with the relevant images etc.
14:08  Fustrated: it calls it under the mouse over event
14:08  doonie: aidan they host it all
14:08  Fustrated: thats why I need a unique name
14:08  doonie: ui + css
14:08  philk_: regarding jQuery CSS... is there a way to define a style of an element based on the themes base classes... say I want to display old entries in a table differently than new entries but not create css for each possible theme. Is there a base class I should use for this?
14:08  Fustrated: for the function as well
14:08  Cork: Fustrated: but that doesn't change that you define it 25 times in the for loop
14:09  Fustrated: ? oh

14:12  Northwoods: nice one
14:12  Fustrated: huh, well, each one needs to check for a different function... so, idk, i don't want to write out 25 different functions and attach each one individually. Like function (CheckForJsRomance){window.Proof_Romance(){event} and then I'd have to attach CheckForJsRomance to span.onmouseover = function(){ } ... or even create spanRomance.onmouseover = function(){} ... I'd love to some how do this dynamically
14:12  Clorith: I solved my problem by disabling autoHeight =)
14:13  molokoi: hello. Is there a way to trigger toggle( specific_state) ?
14:14  aidan: thanks doonie
14:14  Fustrated: Cork, I need to define it 25 times... but as 'CheckForJs'+genre() so that each one is different
14:15  Fustrated: but eval('CheckForJs'+genre)(){event}  isn't accepted as a function
14:15  Cork: Fustrated: line 7 "function CheckForJs(){", that means CheckForJs is overwritten 24 times
14:15  Cork: not added with different actions
14:15  Fustrated: write, thats the part I'm trying to change
14:15  Fustrated: I want to make it eval('CheckForJs'+genre)(){event}
14:16 --- matjas_ is now known as matjas
14:16  Cork: what?
14:16  Fustrated: I mean, 'CheckForJs'+genre(){event}
14:16  Fustrated: if I can avoid eval, great
14:16  Cork: why do you need to create duplicate functions for the same action?
14:16  Cork: pass what you want to check as an attribute
14:17  Fustrated: its not a duplicate, the even for each is a different genre, checkforjsaction, checkforjsromance, ect. and the function itself checks for that specific js file
14:18  Fustrated: to see if romance.js, is attached and if not, attach it, and then I'm making that a rolloever event for when you rolloever the word action so that my movies in that category load
14:18  Cork: Fustrated: and why can you do checkfor('romance') ?

20:40  icekk: or can it be done with a jquery call
20:40  jubblernut: icekk: you could set the div's opacity to 80%, then on hover change it to 100%
20:40  triptec: icekk, yeah have a transparent div over that u change value on
20:40  rubydiamond: danheberden: and one of them has selected as addtional class

20:53  icekk: jubblernut, is there another way to do it thats compatiable?
20:53  jubblernut: you could use jQuery's hover function to toggle 2 different css classes

20:54  triptec: jubblernut, yeah that's true
20:54  triptec: but it's time to drop support for it;)
20:55  icekk: jubblernut, i'll try that, the hover
20:55  icekk: can i just modify the current opacity with the hover class?
20:55  jubblernut: icekk: probably, but you'd have to change all of the various opacity rules. switching classes seems easier
20:56  icekk: jubblernut what about like $("li.fade").hover(function(){$(this).fadeOut(100);$(this).fadeIn(500);});
20:57  nbari: I need to reuuse this paginator: $('#rolesTable').myPaginator({......
20:57  nbari: how or what can I do for avoid copy/paste the same code on all the js

21:09  cyatwork: I downloaded JQuery UI and noticed a bug with the accordion plugin that prevents it from displaying properly when executed on a hidden div.  I found a fix here https://github.com/dominiquevincent/jquery-ui/commit/32b826f1b4970bf98128cbe803b173b8867da4c7 and would like to implement it.  How do I go about editing the js file and reminifying it with the jquery UI core?
21:09  icekk: If I have the following line of code, how do i make it only work on mouse in and not when the mouse moves out also, its like being called twice, i just want it called when the mouse touches it on in and not out   $(".window").hover(function(){$(this).fadeTo("slow", 0.33);$(this).fadeTo("slow", 1);});
21:12  BillCriswell: icekk: You use .mouseout() instead.
21:12  BillCriswell: mousein()*
21:12  icekk: instead of hover?
21:12  joelmccracken: hey guys, there was an article a while back about lessons learned from examining the jquery internals... any idea what that was?
21:13  danheberden: ?g jquery paulirish 10 things i learned
21:13  bot-t: danheberden, 10 Things I Learned from the jQuery Source « Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
21:13  danheberden: tada!
21:13  joelmccracken: thankssssss!
21:14  joelmccracken: i'm mocking out some of the jquery internals, and i thought this might be rather helpful

21:17  BMCouto: i my script only works on IE when i have the document mode on IE9 standards (and i can have browser mode on IE7). it works on all other browsers. does that tell me anything else? anything that was not allowed on previous document modes?
21:20  joelmccracken: so, using jasmine, if I do spyOn(window, '$').andReturn([]);
21:20  joelmccracken: then later I try to do a $.each(..), it wont work

21:33  jxpx777: lol… jeffsmykil there's also a missing quote in $('#alert_panel
21:33  erichynds: icekk, does ui.text even exist in the open event?

21:34  icekk: erichynds, no it doesnt, how do i find out what does?

21:36  Cork[home]: icekk: console.log(ui); ?
21:36  solars: I mean how does $() know its xml?
21:36  Cork[home]: opps missed the old answer :x
21:37  erichynds: solars, what is the result of $.isXMLDoc(xml)?  it might still be an HTML document
21:37  chealer: so, I found documentation on event handlers in http://api.jquery.com/bind/
21:38  chealer: "If there are multiple handlers registered, they will always execute in the order in which they were bound."
21:38  Cork[home]: solars: yes that should work
21:38  chealer: is there a way to visualize in what order are the handlers of an event? perhaps with Firebug?

21:51  monk12: hah....
21:53  monk12: I use it on a radio boxes... i want to custom validate it after something pressed (just that one to disapear the error message for it)... it doesnt have an ID... so cant use  $("#myform").validate().element( "#someInputID" );
21:53  icekk: erichynds event.target.id works, but it gives me the id of the div, how do i get its contents? like <div id="b">get this stuff here</div>
21:53  monk12: can i use a selector in element() func? like .element("input[name=myradioset]")
21:54  alaing: whats the differance between $.data() and $('#something').data(). I'm just reading through the jquery ui change log and apparently the later is more expensive
21:54  erichynds: icekk, $(event.target).html()
21:55  icekk: THank you erichynds
21:56  alaing: $.data(element,key,value) does the element part have to be a native dom element or can it be $('somethingawesome')
21:57  ner0x: Is there an option to make a jQuery dialog overwrite one of the same name, rather than make two?

22:13  peterPan-: bartmax: yes there are :)
22:13  bartmax: alaing: what data questions ?
22:13  alaing: whats the differance between $.data() and $('#something').data(). I'm just reading through the jquery ui change log and apparently the later is more expensive
22:13  alaing: $.data(element,key,value) does the element part have to be a native dom element or can it be $('somethingawesome')
22:14  carbonhat: peterPan, that did it! thanks!
22:14  ajpiano: alaing, $.fn.data is a shortcut method
22:14  laurenty: hey folks
22:14  ajpiano: that calls $.data(elem,key,val)
22:14  peterPan-: carbonhat: you are welcome
22:14  ajpiano: and with $.data it must be a domelement
22:14  ajpiano: so the reason $.data() is faster is cause all the $.fn iteration shit
22:15  alaing: ajpiano: i see so $.fn.data loops through each element and calls $.data()?
22:15  ajpiano: no,
22:15  BillCriswell: $.fn sounds like "fn'" to me which sounds like "fuckin" to me which is actually "fucking".
22:15  ckb: okay, so I'm setting an elements offset multiple times, and the offset values stay the same everytime it gets called, but the offset applied to the element is double what it needs to be each time
22:15  ajpiano: it ends up just returning the first matched element's value
22:17  bartmax: ckb:  more info? code example?
22:17  ckb: well, I changed the offset to happen on docready
22:17  ckb: I'll put it back and provide a link
22:17  bartmax: ckb: actually, your question? :D
22:17  ckb: seems odd to me
22:17  ckb: bartmax: http://portraitsbywendy-com.weathersdesign.com/index.php/the-edge/
22:18  ckb: If you click on the contact tab below the right frame, then close it, and reopen it
22:18  alaing: ajpiano: for example  I got this piece of code that that selects all the inputs and stores its orginal value in .data. $('input:text').each(function(){$(this).data('originaData', $(this).value))}) would be quiet expensive right
22:18  serio: ajpiano, how'd your naughty webcamming go?
22:18  bartmax: If you click on the contact tab below the right frame ....... nothing happens?

22:20  ckb: OH
22:20  ckb: Sorry, refresh it
22:21  Nick_Meister: hi guys im using php in conjunction with jquery, the php script uses sessions and jquery does $.post() methods on a bunch of forms.  And now i am having problems accessing session variables in between scripts when it does the submits
22:21  bartmax: ckb:  ok :P
22:21  ckb: I didn't take that .offset() call out
22:21  Nick_Meister: do you guys know why>
22:21  ajpiano: alaing: i think the fastest possible way to write that would be $("input:text").each(function(i,elem) {  $.data(elem,"originalValue",elem.value);   })
22:21  Nick_Meister: i checked the cookies and session cookies are definately there
22:21  ckb: Nick_Meister: session_start()
22:22  alaing: ajpiano: no that makes better sense to me. as $(this) would have to work through the dom right?
22:22  Nick_Meister: ckb, yes i am using that
22:22  ckb: bartmax: you see what I'm talking about?
22:22  philk__: how can I have only icons on the UI tabs?
22:22  ajpiano: alaing, no, $(this) is just wrapping a dom element, there's no search
22:22  bartmax: ckb:  looking at it....
22:22  pharrisee1: hi, just looking at the template addin for jquery and am hitting a bit of a problem using it with JSTL core and it's ${} syntax, so, my question is, is there any  way of changing the delimiters that jquery template uses?
22:23  bartmax: ckb: tried position instead of offset?
22:23  Nick_Meister: ckb, but when i store something in the variable on one script, the other script thinks the variable is empty
22:23  ckb: .position({top:,left:});?
22:23  bartmax: ?position
22:23  bot-t: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
22:23  ajpiano: alaing: but there is a minimal perf cost to just calling $()
22:23  alaing: ajpiano: so there would not be any speed enhancements by using this over $(this)
22:23  bartmax: bah.
22:24  ajpiano: no there are
22:24  zim: Hi all. what is the jquery command to get the contents of an element? ie $('foobar').what(what) <div class="foobar">I need this</div>
22:24  brianpWins: is there a way to monitor a css attribute and if it chnages fire an event?
22:24  ajpiano: alaing, i have some benchmarks somewhere, just trying to find them

22:28  ckb: bartmax: I changed the positioning to docready rather than the click event
22:28  pharrisee1: as in the ${} business?
22:28  bartmax: ckb:  not really, try to refresh when page tiny in height

22:38  alaing: ner0x: so search for is before you do .dialog
22:38  alaing: is=it
22:38  ner0x: alaing: I would like to, how do I do so?
22:38  brianpWins: tesseracter: becuase myotherthing isn't a function that occurs to that object
22:38  alaing: ner0x: see if the html exists?
22:38  pixellace: ajpiano: function still works and doesn't stop it from happening on .resend items

I'm getting two dialogs with the same name because of the html having the same #ids.
22:42  bartmax: tesseracter: you can avoid the not tfoot if you use #planSelect tbody tr>
22:42  ajpiano: pixellace: i probably wrote the selector wrong in that case
22:42  ajpiano: pixellace, the bottom line is, you need to run live directly against a selector

22:43  bartmax: shouldn't
22:43  alaing: ner0x: cant you rename the ids like my_offiice and all_offices

22:46  alaing: on your button clicks you need to remove the html doe the ajax call and then use that html to build the new dialog right?
22:46  ner0x: Correct.
22:46  ajpiano: tesseracter, this is quite possibly the least performant hover implementation ever
22:46  ajpiano: you're like, doing an insane amount of dom querying and event binding every second
22:46  tesseracter: ajpiano, obviously this is why im here.
22:46  ajpiano: hm
22:47  alaing: ner0x: $('#myhtml').remove(); //do ajax and the nbuild .dialgo again
22:47  ajpiano: tesseracter: step 1, $("#planSelector").delegate() :)
22:47  bartmax: tesseracter: you can create a function getCol(n) { return $selectorObject }
22:48  ajpiano: tesseracter, give me a sec
22:48  bartmax: ?delegate
22:48  bot-t: .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
22:48  ner0x: alaing: It's not longer there since it was take away from the dialog.
22:48  ner0x: alaing: It'll leave parts of the dialog there.
22:48  ajpiano: tesseracter, you got some markup?
22:48 --- nolkyan_ is now known as nolkyan
22:48  tesseracter: ajpiano, one sec
22:48  alaing: how are you removing the html?
22:49  ajpiano: ner0x, are you trying to get rid of a jqui dialog and failing
22:49  alaing: .dialog('destroy')
22:49  tesseracter: ajpiano, a little old, but here: http://jsfiddle.net/KGb4F/7/
22:50  ajpiano: tesseracter <3
22:50  tesseracter: bartmax, http://jsfiddle.net/KGb4F/7/ for you too.
22:50  ner0x: ajpiano: It was a confusing case. I'm trying to "replace" it with another #id being exactly the same already existing. If igured it out though.
22:50  ajpiano: k
22:52  alaing: ner0x: sorry i cant help you any whether i have to go now
22:52  ner0x: ajpiano: alaing: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/56399
22:52  alaing: I'll take a quick look
22:52  ner0x: ajpiano: Destroy the dialog and then since the dialog re-adds the <div> that the dialog was created from back, $(this).remove(); to get rid of that as well.
22:53  ajpiano: ner0x: are you using $("#dialog").dialog("destroy")
22:53  ajpiano: you should call hat before you call remove()
22:53  alaing: ner0x: can you post the call where yo ubuild the dialog
22:53  ner0x: ajpiano: that's exactly what I'm doing.
22:54 --- ihme-TTilus is now known as TTilus
22:54  ner0x: alaing: It's mixed between about 5 functions. :) so no.

22:56 --- Users 760 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 759 normal]
22:56  bartmax: tesseracter: i would do a function that returns the object with a n as a parameter of the index.
22:56  alaing: ner0x: nope
22:56  ner0x: alaing: That's the correct way to do it.
22:57  alaing: ner0x: nope
22:57  ajpiano: tesseracter: i am working on a rewrite, i am going to change it so it doesn't put classnames on the tds but rather the rows
22:57  ajpiano: it makes a lot more sense that way
22:57  ner0x: alaing: What do you mean? It's doing exactly what I want it to.
22:57  alaing: ner0x: if it is then whats the problem?
22:57 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 99 seconds
22:58  tesseracter: ajpiano, ah, that works for the row highlighting, and i know there are optimizations there, but what about the column highlighting/selection?
22:58  ajpiano: tesseracter: yeah you need it for the columns but not the rows
22:58  ner0x: alaing: There isn't one anymore. I mentioned I fixed it a while up.
22:59  ner0x: $("div.ui-dialog div.ui-dialog-content").attr( "id" ); will give you the id of the original dialog create.
22:59  tesseracter: ajpiano, ok, so my row implementation is dumb, but javascript is dumb about columns?
22:59  ajpiano: i got you on a much more perf friendly way to deal with the columns
22:59  ajpiano: much more perf friendly in general
22:59  tesseracter: <3
22:59  alaing: i gtg
22:59  bartmax: i want to see that too ajpiano :)
22:59  alaing: see ya laters
23:00  alaing: same here
23:00  tesseracter: i'm glad i did my mockup work in jsfiddle, and i love the interface, even if i suck at implementation.
23:06  ner0x: ajpiano: Were you speaking to me?
23:06  danheberden: ... or singing?
23:06 * ner0x kills danheberden with a fish.
23:06 * ner0x "A singing fish".
23:07  tesseracter: ner0x, i think i caught ajpiano in a jsfiddle puzzle.
23:07  Whats`up: hi sirs =]
23:07  Whats`up: can i use this code $.getScript('js/mask.js', function() {alert('ok loaded.');}); if not loaded alert another dialog?
23:08  Whats`up: $.getScript('js/mask.js', function() {alert('ok loaded.'); else { alert('not loaded'); });
23:09  Whats`up: anyone?
23:10  ner0x: Whats`up: Have you read the docs?
23:10  Whats`up: full docs ner0x ?
23:11  ner0x: Whats`up: All it is, is an ajax call.
23:11  danheberden: well the else just thrown in there
23:11  danheberden: i think you need more than just docs
23:11  danheberden: ?g learning javascript
23:11  bot-t: danheberden, JavaScript Tutorial - http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
23:11  danheberden: omg
23:11  danheberden: bot-t - do NOT serve that shit here
23:11  danheberden: fucking w3schools
23:11  etcetera_: anyone here used quickui before?
23:11  ner0x: Whats`up: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/  <- Take a look there. It'll explain itself.
23:11  danheberden: ?mdc if else
23:12  Whats`up: ?g learning all web codes and languages.
23:12  bot-t: danheberden, if...else - Executes a statement if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement can be executed. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else
23:12  bot-t: Whats`up, HTML: An Interactive Tutorial - HTML Code Guide: Learn HTML Free - http://www.davesite.com/webstation/html/
23:12 * etcetera_ really doesnt like "control" based development...but it seems interesting.
23:12  etcetera_: basically like code-templates for markup.
23:13  Whats`up: $.getScript('ajax/test.js', function(response, status, xhr) {if (status == "error") {bla bla bla} else { bla bla bla}
23:13  ner0x: Whats`up: I would go with the $.ajax({}); approach.
