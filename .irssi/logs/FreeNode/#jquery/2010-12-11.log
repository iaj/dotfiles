00:54 @bot-t: Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.

00:55  johnline: i want to use 'image_position:' to position individual imgs
00:57  nateL: then do it?
00:58  nateL: what's your question?
00:58  johnline: < nub
01:00  johnline: the current system applies the 'image_position:' style to all images in the slideshow, i am unsure how to impliment code that singles out particular imgs in the slide (by file name) and applies a custom position
01:03  joshsmith: I've had this question unanswered for awhile on SO and am about to offer a bounty for it
01:03 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
01:03  eTiger13: look at the the source or read the documentation
01:03  joshsmith: would love to know if anyone has an answer here before I do
01:03  joshsmith: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151162/patterns-for-a-jquery-or-css-pop-up-menu-from-a-button
01:04  liam: can I do this? $("a", this)  to reference an anchor from inside an element?
01:05  liam: ok nvm
01:08  nateL: joshsmith: this is one of the most basic things jQuery can do - the gist is that on the click event of your button, you use the show method to reveal the previously hidden box
01:08  joshsmith: nateL: I'm more interested in the CSS, I suppose
01:08  joshsmith: I'm quite familiar with toggle()
01:09  nateL: ahh, well I'm not sure how CSS questions are generally dealt with here, but the gist is this
01:09  nateL: the hopup should have display:hidden
01:09  nateL: then when you show it, display:block (or jQuery's toggle/show)
01:10  nateL: it will need to have position:absolute, most likely
01:10  joshsmith: yeah I think it's the position:absolute that I've been getting wrong
01:10  joshsmith: what I've been trying to implement simply displays inline with the nav, which is def not what I want
01:11  nateL: put the contents in their own div
01:11  nateL: then show/hide that
01:11  nateL: and give it display:block; position:absolute;
01:11  joshsmith: what does display:block do for that?
01:12  nateL: it may not actually do anything other than the browser default, but the point there is that it's not inline, in case it was inherited based on your other rules
01:12  joshsmith: ah, gotcha
01:13  marcamillion: drive by SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4412634/my-right-border-of-my-image-disappears-when-link-is-clicked-css-jquery
01:13  marcamillion: anyone got any solutions for that ?
01:14  joshsmith: ah yeah! I think is doing what I want
01:14  joshsmith: *this is
01:14  nateL: cool
01:14  joshsmith: thanks nateL
01:14  nateL: you bet
01:14  johnline: wow this is question room 101 ;p
01:15  joshsmith: any thoughts on aligning it directly below the button, or should I just do it by pixel (e.g. the button is 24px high)
01:15  nateL: that will depend on your layout, but you can also use negative values if that's helpful for you
01:16  joshsmith: meh I tried top:-24px and that ain't doin' it
01:16  nateL: you may have to give the parent container a CSS value of position:relative
01:17  nateL: (keeping in mind that the position values of the child will then be relative to that)
01:17  joshsmith: ah yeah, I think that's what I wanted
01:17  joshsmith: thanks again
01:17  nateL: you bet
01:17  marcamillion: soo... nateL: my turn ? :)
01:17  nateL: lol
01:18  ivyf: I have a jquery bind() question. I want to use bind, but I dont want the "this" in the handler to refer to the element
01:18  joshsmith: anyone know what the compliance is for box-shadow?
01:19  joshsmith: IE what+?
01:19  johnline: i will try reformat my question and come back
01:19  nateL: johnline, looks like an involved one
01:20  nateL: joshsmith: http://www.findmebyip.com/litmus
01:20  nateL: ivyf: can you give more info?
01:21  joshsmith: nateL: eesh. that sucks
01:21  ty2u: using jquery is it possible to request an external page and filter to show only a certain element and its child elements?
01:22  ivyf: sure
01:22  ivyf: I'm binding keyup to an input field
01:22  ivyf: this._inputEl.bind('keyup', this._detect);
01:23  ivyf: in this._detect handler, I use this ot refer to
01:23  ivyf: the whole object
01:23  ivyf: which has other methods
01:23  ivyf: not the element
01:24  eTiger13: ?jquery.load @ ty2u
01:24 @bot-t: ty2u, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
01:25  eTiger13: ivyf:  what whole object?
01:25  ty2u: i see.  so i cant load from an external link i guess

01:29  marcamillion: ahh right....thnx
01:30  marcamillion: re: everything else ? :)
01:30  nateL: sounds like you want the menus to be position:absolute (within containers of position:relative)
01:31  nateL: I think you want them to be block, not inline
01:31  marcamillion: care to respond to the question on SO ?
01:32  nateL: I don't think I have an acct there
01:32  nateL: and frankly, I don't have the time right now
01:32  nateL: my apologies
01:33  marcamillion: ok, fair enough
01:39  g_: ok, so i'm using the validation plugin, and i have a 4 fields named foo[], and i want each one to be required, except, validation is only catching the first input, and not caring about whether the others are filled in. bug?
01:39  ivyf: I got it - I did a  that = this trick
01:39  ivyf: i couldve sqorn that jquery had a way to change the this in bind
01:39  ivyf: sworn
01:40  nateL: it's been real today, fellas
01:40  eTiger13: g_: generally you only have fields named that if they are radios
01:40  nateL: have a good one
01:40  nateL: eTiger13: you're up for now...  ;)
01:41  g_: eTiger13: oh, so how would i handle a group of text inputs?
01:41  eTiger13: g_why would they need to be a group? why would they need the same name?
01:42 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
01:42  g_: eTiger13: i'm asking the user for a collection of words, and so i have a group of inputs
01:43  g_: i could use a textarea and a newline for each word, but i want to control a min and max amount
01:43  eTiger13: g_:  why not just use a comma separated list?
01:43  g_: eTiger13: as above, i'm not sure how validation would handle that
01:44  eTiger13: g_: handle what? one input that is required? hopefully easily
01:44  g_: eTiger13: i need to enforce a min and maximum count. sure in php easy, but i'm not sure how to implement in jquery validation
01:45  eTiger13: split it into an array and then length it
01:45  g_: eTiger13: and besides, i think i'm going to be needing to ask for synonyms for each word as well, so, i need separate inputs
01:45  joshsmith: nateL: mucho props. if you'd like to see how it looks, scroll to the bottom of my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151162/patterns-for-a-jquery-or-css-pop-up-menu-from-a-button/4414525#4414525
01:46  eTiger13: g_: then just use your own validation
01:47  g_: eTiger13: kinda defeats the purpose of having a jquery validation plugin then :(
01:47  eTiger13: g_: well its not an official plugin so its not perfect
01:49  g_: eTiger13: so, foo[] is only acceptable on radio inputs?
01:49  eTiger13: not only but thats the most common use
01:49  g_: ah ok.
01:50  g_: i guess i've got some thinking to do, and talking about it, gave me an idea about how to solve another problem

02:07  Dracos: is there a crash course about the css differences between ui 1.7.2 and 1.8.1?
02:07  semaphore: 0.0.9
02:08  Dracos: version difference I had already worked out
02:08  Dracos: I need to update a very customized 1.7.2 themroller theme to 1.8.1
02:09 @ajpiano: Dracos
02:09 @ajpiano: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Upgrade_Guide
02:09 @ajpiano: but in terms of CSS
02:09 @ajpiano: it's kinda painstaking
02:09 @ajpiano: if you made the modifications directly to the files
02:09  g_: is there a little plugin to offer default text values for text inputs?
02:09  Dracos: I'm not surprised, ui is difficult to customize
02:09 --- spyrosl_ is now known as spyrosl
02:09 @ajpiano: Dracos, what i did was
02:09  bid: hello, i have a question about "toster" im not sure its the right term, i want to show a small popup when the broswer is minimized, notification like gritter plugin. is it possiable? i know that in chrome it can be done and also i read that maybe with window.creatPopup...? can anyone direct me to how to in IE,FF?
02:10 --- spyrosl is now known as peqnp
02:10 @ajpiano: instead of making all the modifications again to the 1.8 stylesheet
02:10 @ajpiano: i made all the modifications to a new stylesheet
02:10 @ajpiano: which i can always use to override the TR defaults
02:10 @ajpiano: even as i update themeroller in the future
02:11  Dracos: I did this one a year ago, pretty sure I wasn't thinking this far ahead
02:11 @ajpiano: i know
02:11 @ajpiano: i am just saying
02:11 @ajpiano: that i went through the same 1.7 -> 1.8 upgrade pretty recently
02:11 @ajpiano: and that's what i did this time
02:11 @ajpiano: in order to prepare for next time :)
02:11  Dracos: k
02:14  crazz: why is it that on some elements, class is not added ? http://pastie.org/1366956
02:14  crazz: I specified document as a selector, I expected all elements to be responsive
02:20  Dracos: now to look and see it we supported multiple css files per plugin
02:22  Dracos: aha! we did
02:23 --- nbari is now known as nbari|away
02:26  crazz: anyone see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1188184/jquery-addclass-not-working
02:28  Dracos: is the 1.8.12 themeroller still available anywhere, or will the current 1.8.7 work for me?
02:41  joshsmith: I've got a kind of tough question (for me at least)
02:41  joshsmith: I have a checkbox that is currently using .bind('click', fn)
02:41  joshsmith: but there are other checkboxes that come on-screen via AJAX
02:41  joshsmith: so I really need it to be .live('click', fn)
02:42  joshsmith: however, I'm calling e.stopPropagation on the fn handler
02:42  joshsmith: when I use return false, it won't have the box checked, so that doesn't work for me
02:42  joshsmith: any thoughts on how to do this?
02:43  joshsmith: I need to stop bubbling because there's a task bar beneath the checkbox that opens an editor when clicked
02:43  joshsmith: so clicking the checkbox also means a check on the bar
02:43  joshsmith: *a click on the bar
02:49  joshsmith: in case anyone wants some SO rep, I posted the question here
02:49  joshsmith: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4414743/how-to-mimic-stoppropagation-using-jquery-live
02:59  rawtaz: hi everyone. i am having a problem in that in safari and chrome, when i click an unchecked radiobutton, the change event triggers before the click event. i have registered two seperate handlers for these events using $(..).live('change', function(){..}); and the same for 'click'
03:00  rawtaz: is there any way to get the same behavior as in IE, FF, Opera, meaning that the click event isnt triggered after the change event?

03:32  johnline: this doesnt work
03:32  johnline: i cant figure out what is stalling the js
03:34  johnline: lol and i just fixd it
03:34  johnline: i think :o
03:55  flam`: Say I have "<div class="post" id="post62">", how can I get only the 62 in id="post62" ?
03:59  tprice: js> var test  = 'post62'.split('post')[1]
03:59  flam`: but how would I get the string 'post62' without specifically typing it in
04:00  flam`: Can I search for $('.post') and then get that same div's id value somehow?
04:03  letterpress: yes, with $(".post").each(function(){ ... $(this).attr("id"); ... })
04:03  tprice: var test = $('.post').id.split('post')[1]
04:04  flam`: thanks
04:06  tprice: var test = $('.post')[0].id.split('post')[1] or maybe that
04:08  flam`: ive got a $(this) inside a $(".adminDeletePost").live('click', function(e){, but the this isn't referencing the .adminDeletePost, but the current url.  Why is that?
04:11  sentientwaffle: Is there a known issue using $().live("change"...)    ?
04:16  Snerf: is there a way to change the values of a class, not a specific element?
04:17  joshsmith: Snerf: yes
04:17  joshsmith: a class represents multiple elements
04:17  joshsmith: depending on your situation
04:18  Snerf: ok
04:19  Snerf: so I need to change all the elements, your saying
04:19 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
04:20  joshsmith: if that's what you want to do
04:20  joshsmith: the way you phrased your question, that's how it sounds
04:20  joshsmith: idk what you mean by "values," though. it's a little vague
04:24  Snerf: are you serious?
04:24  Snerf: you dont know what a value is, cmon now, your just being ignorant
04:25  snover: Snerf: Your question was vague.
04:25  Snerf: no it wasnt
04:25  snover: Two people that can’t peer inside your brain seem to think so.
04:25  Snerf: you change the value of an item in a class, how much simpler is it to word that?
04:25  jastor: Snerf: im not quite getting it either
04:26  crab: you could try saying "blerp", that would have about as much meaning.
04:26  crab: but it's certainly simpler
04:26  jastor: do you mean you want to change calss="this in here" ?
04:26  joshsmith: is there a specific key id (using e.which) for the up and down arrows? I mean something other than what I'd find by just logging it to console
04:26  jastor: class
04:26  jastor: *
04:26  Snerf: wow, you guys are noobs
04:26  jastor: Snerf: yes were noob at understanding your jibberish
04:26  Snerf: example: change the font-size value of a class
04:26  joshsmith: Snerf: Thanks. that's what we get for trying to help
04:26  joshsmith: Snerf: ah! CSS values!
04:26  jastor: Snerf: so you want to change the css .. righto
04:26  joshsmith: Snerf: there you go. clarity rules!
04:26  Snerf: trying to help, being ignorance isnt helping
04:27  joshsmith: omg, I am a vowel
04:27 * joshsmith rocks
04:27  jastor: Snerf: nothing you said hinted that you meant style
04:27  Snerf: jastor.. what the hell is a class?  a bunch of styles
04:27  joshsmith: Snerf: no it's not
04:27  Snerf: obviously I am asking in the wrong channel
04:28  joshsmith: Snerf: no you're not
04:28  Snerf: i'll try #css
04:28  jastor: and id probably say something that insulting people here doesnt help your case either
04:28  joshsmith: lolol
04:28  Snerf: jastor, likewise
04:28  crab: "value" could mean the text contents of an element, the value of an input, the value of an attribute, etc. if you say "value of a class", it certainly doesn't bring to mind css rules.
04:28  jastor: Snerf: youre the one asking for help . not us
04:28  joshsmith: Snerf: crab has it exactly right
04:28  Snerf: crab, I asked for the value of a CLASS.. how is that a textbox?
04:29  snover: ?w Class (computer science) @ Snerf
04:29 @bot-t: Snerf, Class (computer science) - In object-oriented programming, a class is a construct that is used as a blueprint (or template) to create objects of that class. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)
04:29  joshsmith: Snerf: please learn to read. he said text contents
04:29  Snerf: sheesh. I guess saying class, you guys didnt think I meant what that means, CSS
04:29  joshsmith: Snerf: var value = $('.class').text();
04:30  Snerf: well, now that we are clear.. how can I change the value of a "css" setting in a class?
04:30  Snerf: or was that not clear yet?
04:30  jastor: .css();
04:30  overrider: Hello, how can i fetch the id of the next input element http://pastebin.com/mPCNa0g3 . Thanks for any suggestions
04:30  snover: Snerf: What, exactly, are you trying to create?
04:30  crab: e.g. $('.classname').css({background: '#ffffff'})
04:31  joshsmith: Snerf: $('.class').css({'color': '#333', 'background' : '#fff'});
04:31  joshsmith: crab: high five!
04:31  Snerf: ya, never mind
04:31  joshsmith: crab: btw, you do know that you can do #fff and it's shorthand for #ffffff, right?
04:31  joshsmith: #fab === #fabfab
04:31  snover: no
04:31  joshsmith: well
04:32  joshsmith: !==
04:32  crab: ffaabb
04:32  joshsmith: ==
04:32  snover: #fab is #ffaabb
04:32  joshsmith: oh it is?
04:32  Snerf: this isnt working, I think I need to do it to the child of the element..
04:32  joshsmith: my bad
04:32  joshsmith: you learn something new every day
04:32  joshsmith: Snerf: whatever floats your boat
04:32  flam`: is there a .closest() that goes down the DOM tree?
04:32  snover: yes
04:32  flam`: and not up
04:33  joshsmith: isn't it on document?
04:34  l4rk: flam`: probably check if its the element already with filter and if not use find?
04:35  l4rk: i'm not sure if there is an easier way
04:37  flam`: but the starting point, say $('.a') is not a direct parent of what im trying to find, say $('.b').  I just want to find the first occurance of .b after .a
04:37  snover: uhhh.
04:37  snover: what?
04:38  flam`: example: <div class='one'> <p class='a'> </p> </div> <div class='two'> <p class='b'> </p> </div
04:38  flam`: I want to find that immediate b from a, and not any other b's down the dom tree
04:38  crab: flam: .next('.b') if they're sublings
04:39  flam`: they arent
04:39  crab: oh, it's a and b, not one and two.
04:39  flam`: yes
04:39  snover: flam`: There is no way to do what you want to do with the markup you gave there unless you know that the parent is always a <div> and the child is always in the same position or has the same class.
04:40  crab: flam: no easy way to do that afaik
04:41  flam`: that's troublesome :/
04:41  flam`: oh well, thanks
04:42  snover: I mean, I can think of a way, but it’s pretty stupid and grossly inefficient
04:43  snover: you should really just make your markup more predictable
04:43  flam`: It's quite difficult at this point
04:44  flam`: I'm thinking of doing closest('.b').next('.b')
04:44  flam`: or something
04:44  paul_irish: darcyclarke: SUP
04:49  flam`: I did $(this).closest('.b').find('.b').html() and it worked :)
04:50  paul_irish: cool bro
04:50  flam`: Because I know that my this is always between 2 .bs
04:50  flam`: cool story me
04:51  crab: did you mean .closest('.two')?
04:52  flam`: yes
04:52  flam`: in terms of my last example, sorry bout that
04:52  joshsmith: I'm trying to use a ul as a source for autocomplete
04:52  joshsmith: should I use .each() to get each li?
04:53  flam`: actually my last example wasn't accurate as i was looking for the next .two and not the .b in it, so it would be $(this).closest('.two').find('.two')
04:54  flam`: but if i wanted the .b in it I would just add $(this).closest('.two').find('.two').find('.b') or something like that
04:54  darcyclarke: paul_irish hey
04:54  crab: why do you need the find, then? (or maybe i misunderstand closest)
04:54  paul_irish: hows it goin
04:55  darcyclarke: not bad.. wishin I was in the U.S. to grab one of your fancy Chrome OS machines to test drive
04:55  darcyclarke: based on johns post Im a bit skeptical I could dev on it though
04:55  paul_irish: john didnt flip the switch
04:55  paul_irish: NOOOB

04:58  paul_irish: June.
04:58  vladikoff: [1-z]
04:58  snover: LAST FOREVER AGO
04:58  snover: geez darcyclarke
04:58  darcyclarke: saw that
04:58  paul_irish: ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
04:59  darcyclarke: I dont catalog pauls life... geeze snover
05:00  snover: obviously you don’t watch yayquery either :( :(
05:00  flam`: crab, closest goes upwards in the DOM tree
05:00  flam`: find goes downwards
05:00  darcyclarke: thought working at google means you can work everywhere lol
05:01  paul_irish: i moved to sf to work for google
05:01  paul_irish: i could work from boston
05:01  paul_irish: but the ladies look better from here.
05:01  darcyclarke: paul_irish thumbs up
05:01  darcyclarke: hows your tan?
05:01  paul_irish: i dont believe in tans
05:01  crab: flam: oh, so the closest is finding some div which isn't shown in your example markup, and then the find finds the one that's showed? ok
05:01  darcyclarke: you and Slexton alike eh?
05:02  flam`: crab exactly haha.
05:02  joshsmith: paul_irish: where in SF do you live?
05:02  flam`: so it's actually: <div class='two'></div> <div class='one'> <p class='a'> </p> </div>  <div class='two'></div>
05:03  joshsmith: paul_irish: I used to live south of Sunset
05:03  paul_irish: joshsmith: 24th and valencia
05:04  joshsmith: right by BART. nice. not that it matters so much with your fancy shuttle and all
05:05  darcyclarke: paul_irish have you seen Doug lately? (jquery meetings etc.) haven't been able to get more then a 2 minute chat with him for the past 4 days
05:05  joshsmith: paul_irish: you ever go to Ike's?
05:06  paul_irish: whats Ike's?
05:06  paul_irish: darcyclarke: he friended me on facebook today
05:06  joshsmith: best sandwich shop I've ever been to
05:06  paul_irish: and i saw an email from him today.
05:06  paul_irish: i hate sandwiches
05:06  joshsmith: with just about the longest menu ever
05:06  joshsmith: bah, sucks for you
05:06  flam`: u hate sandwiches and dont do tans.  omg
05:06  flam`: that's my entire life right there
05:07  joshsmith: if anyone lives in or visits SF, go to Ike's and order the MILF
05:07  joshsmith: chicken + Frank's Red Hot Sauce + jalapeño poppers
05:07  flam`: sounds spicy
05:07  joshsmith: you better believe it
05:08  flam`: haha
05:08  joshsmith: and expensive, but that's kinda par for the course
05:08  flam`: how expensive
05:08  joshsmith: you should know better to live in SF anyway
05:08  flam`: and how big is the sandwich?
05:08  joshsmith: around $10 expensive
05:08  joshsmith: it's pretty big
05:08  joshsmith: full meal big
05:09  joshsmith: but if you work at Google, I guess you can afford that kind of splurging
05:09  flam`: true
05:09  joshsmith: if you're in a garage, not so much
05:09  flam`: paul_irish did you get a google notebook?
05:10  flam`: im still in the garage :/
05:10  darcyclarke: wow... haven't checked the google group in awhile... things getting expensive paul_irish
05:11  joshsmith: flam`: doing what?
05:13  flam`: I can't really talk about it lol
05:14  flam`: webwork though
05:15  joshsmith: flam`: my advice: talk about it
05:16  joshsmith: talk about it early and talk about it often
05:19  eponym: How can I create a DOM element without inserting it?
05:20  paul_irish: $('div')
05:20  paul_irish: shit
05:20  paul_irish: $('<div>')
05:20  paul_irish: thats how
05:20  eponym: Cool, thanks.
05:24  eponym: if I set a var equal to a DOM element, then use replaceWith() on that element to replace it with something else, will my var still hold the original element?
05:26  frio80: no, the variable holds a reference to that DOM element.
05:27  tsyrak: i am trying to make an html object resizable once it is dropped somewhere
05:27  joshsmith: I'm looking for some thoughts on how to do this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4415013/simple-gmail-like-solution-for-jquery-string-filter-which-highlights-matched-text
05:28  tsyrak: my question is: how can i get access to that object from drop: function( event, ui )
05:28  joshsmith: I don't think AutoComplete is really what I'm looking for
05:29  aro: i love how firefox decides to take up 1.4gb of ram and 40% cpu
05:31  flam`: tsyrak: drop is another word for the onmouseup event
05:31  flam`: sorta
05:32  tsyrak: yeah i get what the drop section does
05:32  tsyrak: i just don't get how to access the object being dropped from there
05:32  crab: joshsmith: have you seen the "combobox" example in the autocomplete demos?
05:33  joshsmith: crab: not 'til now
05:33  joshsmith: I actually think I might have found something simpler here: http://kilianvalkhof.com/uploads/listfilter/
05:34  tsyrak: the doc says 'ui.draggable - current draggable element, a jQuery object.' > how can i access its content?
05:34  tsyrak: if i try a resizable() on it it actually makes the parent resiable also
05:35  tsyrak: i'm just not sure how to look into that ui.draggable object further
05:36  tsyrak: ...Hmm my bad parent does not resize... it just moves around

06:01  Tasyne: What would be the $('') jQuery selector to select all <text> elements under an object with a certain node? Is that even possible?
06:02  Tasyne: sorry, all <text>s under an element with a given class.
06:03  OhaiBBQ: text
06:03  OhaiBBQ: .class text
06:04  tprice: anyone used the tmpl plugin?
06:04  tprice: i cant seem to get it to work
06:04  dilvie: tprice: paste
06:04  Tasyne: OhaiBBQ: thanks :)
06:05  joshsmith: hmm
06:05  tprice: im trying to template a li into a ul but the li element does not show
06:05  tprice: it just shows the text
06:05  joshsmith: I've got a keyboard shortcut that brings up a menu with an input
06:05  tprice: something like this ( "movieTemplate"  ).tmpl( dataArray ).appendTo($(li + ' ul')).page();
06:05  joshsmith: but it puts the key pressed for the shortcut in the input
06:06  joshsmith: how can I prevent that from happening?
06:06  tprice: and then i have this that i use in the tmpl <script id="movieTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"> <li><b>${name}</b> (${type}) (${message}) (${logtime}) (${action})</li></script>
06:06  joshsmith: nvm
06:07  joshsmith: e.preventDefault
06:07  joshsmith: duh

06:26  quizme: i just called a bunch of thumbnails down from flickr.  how do i add click handlers to them?
06:30  tsyrak: you need to add the handler inside of the ajax function
06:31  tsyrak: inside of its callback quicksilver
06:31  tsyrak: quizme
06:32  quizme: tsyrak ok thanks
06:33  quizme: tsyrak i figured it out
06:33  quizme: i added a class to the images from flickr
06:33  quizme: then added the click handlers at the end of the success function
06:40  randy__: So guys I've been messing around with the .scrollTo plugin and localscroll and I can't seem to make it work. I've been at it for two days now and It simply eludes me.
06:41  randy__: anyone here?
06:42  quizme: i'm here but i'm useless
06:43  wunderkin: don't quiz him
06:43  randy__: no worries
06:44  randy__: I guess I'll just continue failing miserably :)
06:48  vladikoff: randy__, got errors? do you have a live page ?
06:48  randy__: I've been working on localhost and I'm not really getting errors, it just doesn't seem to be functioning at all
06:49  Edler: guys
06:49  randy__: I've checked my links to the js files like a million times
06:49  Edler: anyone here messed aroudn with the youtube javascript api ?
06:53  tsyrak: does using resizable() on an object removes its draggable properties?
06:54  tsyrak: i have a bit Edler
06:54  tsyrak: long ago
06:58  tsyrak: if i set an image draggable() after dropping it, then i just can't move it anymore....
07:07  tsyrak: hmm it's a problem with images
07:07  tsyrak: i can make a droppable div resizable after dropping it no problem, behaves as expected
07:08  tsyrak: if i do the exact same thing on an image, the layout is meesed up + the img can be resized sure but they cannot be dragged anymore
07:08  tsyrak: anyone aware of that?
07:30  noaXess: good morning..
07:30  iszak: Morning noaXess
07:31  noaXess: i try this jquery lightbox plugin.. http://www.balupton.com/sandbox/jquery-lightbox/demo/ but if i use $('a:has(img)').lightbox(); than all a/images on the site will be included in lithbox counter..
07:31  noaXess: can i use that? $('a').attr('rel=lightbox').lightbox();
07:31  iszak: no
07:31  iszak: use $('a[rel=lightbox]')
07:31  iszak: attr is for setting or getting an attribute, not filtering.
07:31  noaXess: aha.. ok
07:32  iszak: unless you wanted to set an attribute to lightbox?
07:32  iszak: in which case you'd use $('a').attr('rel', 'lightbox');
07:32  noaXess: no just check if a has attr rel=lightbox..
07:32  iszak: the later then
07:32  iszak: or $('a').filter('[rel=lightbox]');
07:32  iszak: so you'd probably want $('a[rel=lightbox]:has(img)').lightbox(); ?
07:33  noaXess: iszak: ha.. thanks..
07:33  iszak: no prboelm
07:33  iszak: s/prboelm/problem
07:33  noaXess: i tried that: $('a[@rel*=lightbox]').lightbox(); but won't work.. it's from another lightbox version
07:34  iszak: yeah, you no longer use the @
07:35  noaXess: ok..
07:35  iszak: the original lightbox isn't as popular as it once was, a lot of people now use alternatives.
07:35  iszak: fancybox is a good alternative.
07:35  noaXess: iszak: ok...
07:35  noaXess: link?
07:35  iszak: ?g fancybox @ noaXess
07:35 @bot-t: noaXess, Fancybox - Fancy lightbox alternative - http://fancybox.net/
07:36  noaXess: iszak: ok.... will test that-
07:36  iszak: i mean if you haven't got the time - stick with lightbox.
07:37  noaXess: iszak: i will also have text in a box.. so fancybox looks nice
07:38  iszak: excellent.

07:44  Blink7: i have a <button name="button_name" value="1">Click</button> When I click on it and fire a $('form').serialize(); the button and value are not there, any ideas?
07:48  noaXess: grrr..
07:48  noaXess: anybody work with tinymce?
07:49  noaXess: i try to insert a template into tinymce editor, and that template has html jquery code init.. beut only html will be inserted.. but if i manually insert the jq code.. it works
08:00  ruby_on_tails: hello
08:01  ruby_on_tails: how can i scroll the user to the top of the page on an event ?
08:01  iszak: ?scrollTop
08:01 @bot-t: .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
08:01  iszak: ?scrollTop(value)
08:01 @bot-t: .scrollTop(value): Set the current vertical position of the scroll bar for each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/#scrollTop2
08:01  iszak: e.g. $('body,html').scrollTop(0); IIRC
08:03  ruby_on_tails: got it
08:32  joshsmith: how can I find what has the current focus?
08:37  quizme: joshsmith: i'm guessing but maybe something like this:  if( $('.overlay').is(':hidden') ){
08:38  quizme: replace hidden with focus
08:38  quizme: or something
08:38  joshsmith: quizme: I actually think it's document.activeElement
08:38  quizme: maybe do a google search on "jquery is focus"
08:38  quizme: ok
08:38  joshsmith: thanks though
08:38  quizme: sorry i was just guessing
08:38  joshsmith: no, it's totally cool
08:39  snover: if document.activeElement == some element, some element is focused.
08:39  joshsmith: I'm running into a weird issue where my keyboard shortcuts (which are only listened for when not focused on an input) aren't getting picked up until after I click on the document not once, but twice
08:39  joshsmith: if I try to manually set focus to the document, it still doesn't do it
08:39  joshsmith: very weird
08:40  joshsmith: the thing I'm working on is something like Gmail's labeling
08:40  joshsmith: you have an email selected, hit "L", it opens up a menu
08:40  joshsmith: you click out of the menu and it returns focus to the document
08:40  joshsmith: you should be able to hit "L" again
08:41  joshsmith: but in my case, I have to click on the document twice
08:41  joshsmith: any brilliant thoughts as to what's going on?
08:44  quizme: sorry i'm a newbie
08:45  joshsmith: so am I
08:47  joshsmith: huh
08:47  joshsmith: this is even weirder than I thought
08:47  joshsmith: when starting fresh (i.e. when "L" should open up the menu no problem)
08:47  joshsmith: if I click on the document once
08:47  joshsmith: it won't work
08:47  joshsmith: if I click a second time, it'll work again
08:48  joshsmith: so clicking the document toggles on and off my ability to listen for the keyboard nav
08:48  joshsmith: that makes zero sense to me
08:51  coldhead: you are almost certainly doing it wrong
08:52  joshsmith: I'm guessing, just have no idea how/why
08:52  joshsmith: trying to JSFiddle something up
09:06  joshsmith: gah, I can't reproduce this outside of my actual code
09:10  joshsmith: ah, nvm, I found the issue
09:10  coldhead: good work, joshsmith
09:10  joshsmith: grazie
09:10  coldhead: best wishes for the rest of your life
09:10  snover: was it coldhead’s fault?
09:10  joshsmith: it was indeed
09:10  coldhead: i am so sorry
09:11  joshsmith: it's alright. you couldn't have known
09:11  ss23: Dammit, coldhead always messing things up
09:17  joshsmith: I had a focus on an input somewhere in my code that worked whether the menu was up or not; it should've been focusing only when the menu was visible
09:21  tsyrak: it's too bad there is no comments section in the jquery ui docs
09:21  snover: tsyrak: why do you say that?
09:21  tsyrak: i have just spent hours to find out that jquery does not support draggable + resizable images (you have to put the resizable img in a draggable div)
09:22  tsyrak: i can't be the only one to have been through that and i can't even put a memo online
09:22  tsyrak: i love the php docs for that
09:22  snover: If you think it should be possible, please submit a bug report :)
09:23  tsyrak: okay will do
09:23  joshsmith: boo-yah: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4415013/simple-gmail-like-solution-for-jquery-string-filter-which-highlights-matched-text/4415881#4415881

09:25  tsyrak: nice website joshsmith
09:25  tsyrak: are you the owner?
09:25  joshsmith: I am indeed
09:25  joshsmith: and thanks
09:25  tsyrak: you're welcome. that's funny cause i'm designing a vision board website atm
09:25  joshsmith: it needs a bit of an overhaul on the landing page, but as soon as I get some stuff refactored
09:25  joshsmith: oh, nice!
09:26  joshsmith: that's awesome
09:26  tsyrak: i'm bookmarking your site
09:26  joshsmith: do you have anything I can look at?
09:26  tsyrak: will let you know when the first version is up if you want
09:26  joshsmith: heh we get enough fundage in the coming months and maybe we can acqui-hire you ;)
09:26  tsyrak: well nah started the design like 3 days ago
09:26  tsyrak: héhé sure
09:26  tsyrak: maybe we can partner or something
09:26  tsyrak: we'll see
09:27  joshsmith: and I'm only quarter-kidding
09:27  tsyrak: nice to see anyway, makes me think my vision board idea ain't stupid lo
09:27  tsyrak: business is going good?
09:29 --- joshsmith_ is now known as joshsmith
09:29  joshsmith: sorry, got d/ced
09:30  joshsmith: last I heard you were making a vision board web app
09:30  joshsmith: and I was asking if you had anything you could show me
09:33  tsyrak: well nah started the design like 3 days ago
09:33  joshsmith: meh I'd still be curious
09:33  tsyrak: hehe
09:33  joshsmith: do you have any idea how many revisions Goals went through?
09:33  joshsmith: and is still going through?
09:34  tsyrak: i guess so
09:34  tsyrak: has to
09:34  joshsmith: I'd really love to make an animation of the design changes at some point on Vimeo or something
09:34  tsyrak: CANI, constant and never ending improvement ;)
09:35  tsyrak: well you ask people to sign up right away
09:35  tsyrak: it might be worth letting them sign in with facebook or test drive the site
09:35  tsyrak: people don't like signing up
09:35  tsyrak: or you have to bribe them when you do héhé
09:36  tsyrak: it really looks neat tho
09:36  stygyan: u know what cani is in spanish, tsyrak?
09:36  tsyrak: gonna try it later
09:36  joshsmith: well I actually don't let people sign up right away
09:36  joshsmith: it's a very closed alpha
09:36  tsyrak: i'm curious if it can work as sort of a todo list for me
09:36  tsyrak: ah okay
09:36  joshsmith: but when I open it up, people will able to sign up with Facebook
09:36  tsyrak: stygyan: hmm dunno, tell me :)
09:36  stygyan: guido, chav
09:36  joshsmith: I've actually integrated Facebook, Google, and Twitter OAuth connections
09:36  tsyrak: yeah it's nice if you can sell it as a select thing for starters :)
09:37  tsyrak: what about that opensocial thing, did it ever take off?
09:37  joshsmith: so you can find friends who've connected with all of the above
09:37  joshsmith: not really, no
09:37  joshsmith: what's really nice about connecting with Facebook with Goals is that we take your interests from FB
09:37  tsyrak: i ve tried it for the first time the other day but it wasn't in sync so i had to wait so i left
09:37  joshsmith: and recommend interests, goals, dreams, etc. on Goals
09:38  joshsmith: I literally only had like six interests on FB and I got recommended a whole ton of really relevant, awesome stuff when I tested it on myself
09:38  crab: what is a vision board web app?
09:38  joshsmith: crab: http://www.google.com/images?q=vision+board&um
09:39  joshsmith: tsyrak: I was initially going to have vision boards be a part of Goals, so it'll be interesting to see what you come up with
09:39  crab: good god.
09:39  joshsmith: crab: pretty tacky, but a lot of people swear by 'em
09:40  noaXess: what is faster: $('#divid').load('load.php') or $.get('load.php', function(data) { $('#divid').html(data); });
09:41  tsyrak: snover: there is already a ticket open, should i add to it? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3446
09:42  noaXess: anyway.. have trouble with both if returning data has javascript included.. then it won't be loaded.. but only in IE6+.. any idea? in FF and safari it works fine..
09:43  tsyrak: i'll message you here or by email when i've got something up n running joshsmith :)
09:44  joshsmith: tsyrak: message me before. don't worry about being stealthy or anything. I might be able to give some feedback here and there
09:44  joshsmith: josh at goals dot com
09:45  snover: tsyrak: add a comment if it is actually contributing useful information, otherwise if you want you can register an account and vote on it
09:46  tsyrak: pretty easy to remember!
09:46  tsyrak: ok will do
09:46  tsyrak: if i can save some time to the dev
09:48  noaXess: any idea why ie6 don't show all content retunring trouhg .load or $.get? if i enable a alert(data) befor .load or .hml i can see the html, but ie won't show it..
09:49  joshsmith: *sigh* fixing one bug just begets another
09:49  noaXess: ie just stripp the html if there is javascript code included..
09:52  sone: IE 6 is too old man why waste time testing on it
09:53  ss23: sone: Because for some sites it still accounts for 15% of sales
09:53  noaXess: sone: it's not only in ie6 also in ie7
09:55  joshsmith: what's the difference between '.class:first' and '.class :first' ?
09:56  ss23: It's a CSS selector
09:56  ss23: Hmm
09:56 --- joshsmith_ is now known as joshsmith
09:56  ss23: I'm not sure joshsmith ;_;
09:57  joshsmith: both seem to function the same, but I'd think there would be a difference
09:57  joshsmith: just not discernible at first glance
10:03  tsyrak: eyes burning
10:03  tsyrak: gtg! cu
10:06  joshsmith: wow ALL the work I did today
10:06  joshsmith: was not even on my to-do list
10:06 * joshsmith fail
10:06  joshsmith: I mean it was stuff that needed done
10:06  joshsmith: but I thought I'd be able to delete all this stuff
10:06  joshsmith: or fix some bugs in Bugzilla
10:06  joshsmith: nope.
10:06  joshsmith: nothing.
10:07  joshsmith: what a letdown

11:54  prism: even google/youtube no longer officially support it
11:54  noaXess: prism: but it affect also IE7 and IE8
11:55  prism: what doctype are you using
11:55  noaXess: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> and alos transitional.. both same problem
11:55  prism: try using something that is even rendered in IE
11:55  noaXess: now it works..
11:56  prism:  XHTML:  http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/  http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml And the MUST READ: http://www.dev-archive.net/articles/xhtml.html
11:56  prism: unless you are using a valid XML/xhtml application
11:56  prism: you should be using 4.01-strict
11:56  prism: or a subset of 4.01, or even html5
11:56  prism: but not xhtml it is misused in 90% of occurances
11:56  prism: and IE does not even support it, it just mubngles the code to make it work like html
11:57  sone: lol is that a word mubngles?
11:58  prism: it was meant to be 'mungles' but that its self is a subset of prism (tm) shorthand
11:58  prism: ;-)
12:00  prism: noaXess, the main keypoint would be this:
12:00  prism: XHTML does not have good browser support. In typical setups, most browsers simply pretend that your XHTML pages are regular HTML (which presents a number of problems, as I'll explain later). Some major browsers like Firefox, Opera, and Safari may attempt to handle the page as proper XHTML if and only if you include a special HTTP header instructing it to do so. But when you do, Internet Explorer and a number of other user agents will ch
12:00  prism: oke on it and won't display a page at all. Even when handled as XHTML, the supporting browsers have a number of additional bugs, which I'll also discuss in this article.
12:01  noaXess: prism: i see i see... but as i said.. i have fixed it.. :).. so need some food..
12:01  prism: http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml#myths is the refference for that ^
12:01  prism: its just a very bad idea to use xhtml at the end of the day >.>

12:47  pallet: I need to do it without a page refresh
12:48  igor_111: and prev, next onclick makes another request
12:48  igor_111: with jquery
12:48  igor_111: the difference is in data format, may be, that you should send
12:49  igor_111: and the request should be in js

16:40  jones-: hello. I know next to nothing to jquery, but I'm trying to debug something and I could use some help
16:40  jones-: It's about checking if some options in a select are selected
16:41  emidln: why would a td's this.parentNode.rowIndex change to -1?
16:41  jones-: I have a select with 2 options, and both have selected="selected"
16:41  Cork[home]: ?.val @ jones-
16:41 @bot-t: jones-, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
16:41  jones-: and in the js code I do options.hasClass("selected"), but it
16:41  jones-: is false.
16:42  dyer_: Anyone around that is pretty good w/ jQueryMobile?
16:42  Cork[home]: jones-: why would options have a class selected?
16:42  dyer_: I have having some issues with select lists, and would really appreciate someone sparing a moment to beat this into my head :)
16:42  sac: selected="selected" doesn't mean it has class selected
16:42  jones-: Cork[home]: I have no idea, this is some code I wanted to use, which obviously is not working to that reguard :)
16:42  mushin: Cork[home]: yeah i know but do you know if its possible to get it to fill in the whole space to the left of the FixedWith_Right div?
16:43  mushin: Cork[home]: see thats why i tried width 100% first
16:43  Cork[home]: jones-: selected is an attribute; BUT it will only reflect what the source said to show as the default
16:43  Cork[home]: jones-: you need to use .val on the select box to find what the user selected
16:43  Cork[home]: mushin: no, you would have to use position:absolute
16:44  Cork[home]: mushin: two floats can't ever fill the entire width, you need to leave wiggle room
16:45  jones-: Cork[home]: it's more like I want to loop the options and do something with each that is selected. This is my code so far: http://pastebin.com/NvnSUcVe
16:45  Cork[home]: ex. one float can be 50% and the other can be 49%
16:45  jones-: Cork[home]: and it
16:45  Cork[home]: jones-: the options doesn't have info about if they are selected by the user
16:45  jones-: and it is a multiple selection select, btw
16:45  Cork[home]: as i said
16:45  Cork[home]: only if they where selected by default
16:46  jones-: Cork[home]: yeah, I care about default selection, not user's.
16:46 --- ohcibi_ is now known as ohcibi
16:46  Cork[home]: jones-: only the selectbox it self has the information about the users actions
16:46  Cork[home]: ah
16:46 * Cork[home] wonders why that would be...
16:46  jones-: heh, and at the moment the default options have selected="selected" in the html
16:46  jones-: so how can I fix my if in that foreach?
16:47  Cork[home]: $('select option[selected')
16:47  Cork[home]: *$('select option[selected]')
16:47  jones-: what is select there?
16:47  Cork[home]: the select parent
16:47  jones-: ok, I
16:48  jones-: I'll try something, I hope I manage because I know nothing of js and jquery :)
16:48  Cork[home]: or you could do something like filter('option[selected]')
16:48  Cork[home]: if you already have the options selected
16:48  jones-: yeh, the options are and appear selected
16:48  jones-: but I wouldn
16:48  jones-: 'w know how to use that filter thing in my if
16:48  jones-: wouldn't*
16:49  jones-: (typing for foreign keyboard, sorry for the mess)
16:49  mushin: Cork[home]: ok that sucks.. do you think it would be possible to calculate the remaining width with jquery and give that value to #Fluid_Left?
16:49  Cork[home]: options.filter('option[selected]').length > 0
16:49  jones-: Cork[home]: I know I
16:49  Cork[home]: or options.filter(option[selected]').each(function() { this )}; if yo want to work with each of the options
16:50  jones-: I know I'm asking a lot, but could you write that code so it fits the rest of my code I pasted?
16:50  jones-: oh
16:50  jones-: that would be even better
16:50  Cork[home]: mushin: as i sad you can't ever make floats fill the width, as it will wrapp if this happens
16:50  Cork[home]: mushin: its how html works
16:50  Cork[home]: if you want to fill it use absolute position
16:51  Cork[home]: or put one inside the other
16:56  mushin: Cork[home]: alright thanks for the help buddy
16:57  emidln: why would the logical order or a row be -1 (i.e. the value returned from an HTMLTableRowElement in the dom via $('td').click(function() { this.parentNode.rowIndex; }); )
16:57  emidln: *logical order of a row
16:58  Cork[home]: emidln: use $(this).parent().inde() instead
16:58  Cork[home]: *index
16:59  emidln: ok, I'm assuming that does some sort of cross-browser magic
16:59 --- grhwood_ is now known as grhwood
16:59  sac: you could check the jquery source code to see what it actually does
16:59  emidln: since the direct DOM access works on Mozilla but fails on Chrome
17:05  jones-: Cork[home]: I'm more than puzzled. I did as you suggested and it kinda looks like it should work, because I can step into the "each", but look at this code. http://pastebin.com/JfCh1JjQ If I put a breakpoint at line 5, it never stops. If I put it at line 4 it stops, but when I step over, the debugger behaves like it
17:05  jones-: like it is done.
17:06  jones-: I have tried both in Firebug and in Chrome's debugger.
17:07  jones-: Also a breakpoint inside addItem will not be reached.
17:07  Cork[home]: http://pastebin.com/BzDSG3hW
17:08  jones-: I'll try.
17:09  jones-: MAGIC! It works! :)

17:15  Wes-: Anybody know what I'm doing wrong?
17:15  nlogax: that part of it is fine, if your selector is right
17:15  nlogax: console.log($("#dlg_KBAdminMenu_kbDetails form .add").length)
17:16  Wes-: Hm - I could sworn that selector was okay, but don't know how to debug it ^^^^ that looks like a good idea, thanks

17:41  paul_uk: hey all, i've got the issue where because the js hasn't loaded and the DOM hasn't initialised.  When a user clicks on a a tag it goes to the url instead of a click event.  i've been reading on head.js less.js i.e to stop scripts blocking.  but whats the best solution to use?
17:41 --- sky|plone is now known as skylamer`
17:45  claudio: paul_uk, the best? Put your js just after the HTML containing the tags and don't wait for dom ready
17:46 --- bekabook is now known as bekabug
17:46  RTPMatt:  paul_uk: use jquery(document).ready
17:46  claudio: of course, jquery must already by there... but then you can use require.js (head.js is still a little young, maybe) to fire something as soon as jquery has been loaded
17:46  RTPMatt: ? ready @paul_uk
17:46 @bot-t: paul_uk, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
17:47  claudio: uh. I assumed he already use .ready
17:47  claudio: ok, I'll stfu
17:47 --- Chainfire_ is now known as Chainfire
17:48  RTPMatt: he may be, it sounded like a .ready problem to me
17:48  paul_uk: RTPMatt: yeah I'm using .ready
17:49  paul_uk: but the issue is when jquery and my js file is currently loading.  if i click on an a link i go to the url instead of what it should be doing.
17:49  RTPMatt: paul_uk: what are you doing that causes the .ready to not work then?
17:50  paul_uk: RTPMatt:  It's like this, when the page has finished loading and the Dom is initialised.  I have no problems with my code.
17:51  claudio: paul_uk, the fact is, if you "see" the link, then the js capturing them should already be in place
17:51  RTPMatt:  paul_uk: well, there is only so much you can do about that.  you can instead of using .ready you can move the javascript to the bottom of the page, then it will probably fire sooner
17:51  grandy: hello, anyone know if there's an irc room for backbone.js
17:51  paul_uk: RTPMatt: well Im using the html5boilerplate and all the js is at the bottom of the page
17:53  RTPMatt: if it is at the bottom of the page, you dont need to use .ready, and make sure that all of your JS for handling your links is first, that is about as quick as you can do it
17:56  RTPMatt: paul_uk: you could put onclick="return false;" on the actual a tags if it is really a problem for you
17:57  paul_uk: RTPMatt: i think the issue is more to do with that jquery isn't loaded and within that time an a tag acts like one, instead of being used by jquery.
17:58  RTPMatt: paul_uk: yeah, that sounds like it is exactly what the problem is,  you can add return false; to the onclick, and the does not require jquery, it is not my favorite solution, but you can do it
18:00  iEatChildren: Ive been playing around with some jquery but cant figure out how to do what i want. Basically if you look at the following code im trying to make it so when you click one of the links for a song that the "lyrics" div for only that song shows. Can anyone show me how to make this happen? http://pastebin.ca/2016606
18:02  RTPMatt: iEatChildren: there is no jquery in there, so it is hard to help you, you probably waht to do something where when a link is clicked you .show() the lyrics div.
18:02  iEatChildren: RTPMatt: the jquery code i wrote simple shows all of the "lyrics" divs when any link is clicked
18:02  iEatChildren: im not sure how to use $(this) to make what i want happen
18:03  iEatChildren: ill re-post with my existing jquery code
18:03  iEatChildren: http://pastebin.ca/2016613
18:05  RTPMatt: iEatChildren: you probably want to cvhange this: $('.lyrics').show() to this: $(this).next().show()
18:05  paul_uk: iEatChildren, $(this) is what it is referenced too.  i.e say with an a tag $('.foo').live('click', function() {  $(this) would be the a tag and then you can do $(this).attr('class') to get the class of the tag.
18:05  RTPMatt: ? next @ iEatChildren
18:05 @bot-t: iEatChildren, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
18:06  iEatChildren: RTPMatt: thank you
18:06  RTPMatt: sure thing
18:08  DeathRayDragonLu: okay — here's a question that google can't seem to answer for me
18:08  DeathRayDragonLu: i totally get .delegate() and it's nefarious powers
18:08  DeathRayDragonLu: but
18:08  DeathRayDragonLu: if i do more than one .delegate() call;
18:08  DeathRayDragonLu: say, for different elements on the page...
18:09  DeathRayDragonLu: does it "stack" the bound events?
18:09  RTPMatt: DeathRayDragonLu: yes
18:09  DeathRayDragonLu: or does it just keep one binding?
18:09  DeathRayDragonLu: gotcha
18:09  RTPMatt: you can bind many
18:10  DeathRayDragonLu: that doesn't seem optimized
18:10  DeathRayDragonLu: i'm not sure i'm making sense
18:10  DeathRayDragonLu: let me go set up a scenario and come back
18:10  DeathRayDragonLu: :p
18:10  RTPMatt: eh, jquery can't prevent the programmer from making poor decisions
18:10  RTPMatt: ok
18:11  DeathRayDragonLu: lol
18:11  DeathRayDragonLu: hold on — let me set it up over @ jsbin
18:18  DeathRayDragonLu: okay
18:18  DeathRayDragonLu: he's back
18:19  DeathRayDragonLu: http://jsbin.com/asiki3/edit
18:19  DeathRayDragonLu: so is this innefficient?
18:19  DeathRayDragonLu: or, rather
18:19  DeathRayDragonLu: does this actuall bind 3 events to the body tag?
18:20  RTPMatt: DeathRayDragonLu: well, id does not make much sense to use .delegate on the body tag, that is what .live does
18:20  DeathRayDragonLu: sure
18:20  RTPMatt: the point of delegate is that it does not operate on the entire document, but on a sub section of it
18:20  DeathRayDragonLu: I get that
18:21  DeathRayDragonLu: I'm just trying to figure out how to bind delegate one click event to an element (like the body tag) but have it act on different elements inside the body tag
18:21  DeathRayDragonLu: one to many
18:21  DeathRayDragonLu: instead of many to many
18:21  DeathRayDragonLu: i realize i can just use .bind and if/else $.closest
18:22  DeathRayDragonLu: but i was wondering if delegate/live manages this for you automagically
18:22  RTPMatt: you can do .delegate and pass it "p, h1, h2", then inside if the fctn check what this is and do something based on that
18:22  DeathRayDragonLu: — ah!  the answer
18:22  DeathRayDragonLu: cool
18:23  RTPMatt: wellm there ya go!
18:23  DeathRayDragonLu: ha
18:23  maxiking: Hey guys, how can I go to "0" after clicked on "3"? http://jsfiddle.net/rM75z/
18:24  DeathRayDragonLu: still wonder if .bind would be more efficient :p
18:24  DeathRayDragonLu: but thanks for the answer :)

18:26  jamov: i have something like this: $(".item h4 a").live("click", function() { place_widget(this); }); where the place_widget() could return a value. but how do i pass that value from that event/function to another? such as function do_sth(value_from_place_widget) {... ?
18:26  jbw: maxiking,  http://jsfiddle.net/rM75z/1/
18:27  maxiking: jbw++
18:27  maxiking: thx
18:27  RTPMatt: DeathRayDragonLu: it depends, for 3 events, it does not make a big difference, but if you are binding a LOT of events .bind is faster on the initial bind.  If you are binding to a LOT of DOM nodes, .live is faster on the initial bind.
18:28  RTPMatt: jamov: var x = place_widget(this); do_sth(x); ??
18:29 --- grhwood_ is now known as grhwood
18:29  jamov: if i do that var x = .. inside the live bind, the x is out of scope when i want to pass it to a function somewhere else
18:30  FunkyDude: when posting a form via $.post(), i want to replace the form with something else if ok, but if not show error messages to each of the fields not correct, how can i do this?
18:30  RTPMatt: DeathRayDragonLu: actually i misspoke, if you are binding a lot of events, .bind is faster on the lookup, when running the event, not on the initial bind
18:30  FunkyDude: i thought of passing an array from php that contains all the error messages, then having javascript evaluate it and display the error messages, though not sure if this is the best method
18:31  DeathRayDragonLu: RTPMatt — that was my suspicion
18:33  iEatChildren: Now that i have the appropriate div showing i decided to put the lyrics in a dialog box. The problem im running in to now is that the dialog box will only open 1 time per link. Here is the code http://pastebin.ca/2016641
18:34  iEatChildren: Say i click "Song One".... the dialog box opens with the correct content but if i close that dialog box and click the same link again nothing happens
18:36  RTPMatt: iEatChildren: this is a common problem people have with dialogs, you need to move the $(this).next().dialog({ title: title }); statment out of the click event, and add the property autoOpen: false, then in the click event you do $(this).next().dialog('open')
18:37  RTPMatt: the problem is that you are creating the dialong on every click you want to create it outside of the event, and simply open it in the event
18:37  iEatChildren: i think i see what you are saying
18:38  iEatChildren: can you update my jquery code so i can understand what you are talking about?
18:38  RTPMatt: actually you shouldnt be doing $(this).next() you should make a seperate dialog div on the page and be doing $('#dialog').dialog(...) or something like that
18:38  RTPMatt: give me 1 second
18:38  iEatChildren: thank you
18:41  RTPMatt: iEatChildren: i did not test it, but you want something like this: http://pastebin.ca/2016648
18:41  RTPMatt: im going to go get some food ill be back later
18:41  iEatChildren: thank you again
18:42  RTPMatt: oh, actualkly more like this: http://pastebin.ca/2016649

18:49  [M]ax: jcody whats the wmode that you use?
18:50  jcody: i haven't set one. checking out the flowplayer docs now.
18:50  [M]ax: wmode=transparent on the flash
18:50  [M]ax: will allow you to place something with a higher z-index over the flash video
18:51  Bartzy: If I do an AJAX request and the response is with Content-Disposition header.. the browser will popup the Save-As dialog ?
18:51  jcody: [M]ax - thanks so much! setting to either transparent or opaque gives me the ability to fade it.
18:52  [M]ax: transparent is better :D
18:52  [M]ax: z-index doesnt work with opaque

18:59  aro: is anyone aware of a plugin that will strip certain elements from a pasted or typed string in a field?
18:59  aro: (like if someone were to paste something in with a bullet, it would strip it out)
19:00  ravenzz: you would strip html tags
19:00  ravenzz: or simple words

19:02  ldexterldesign: also can anyone recommend a good html5 book?
19:03  ravenzz: aro you can do that with regex
19:03  ravenzz: and replace()
19:04  ravenzz: ldexterldesign google a bit
19:04  ravenzz: or join #html5
19:04  ldexterldesign: cheers
19:04  aro: would i do it on keyup?
19:04  aro: the regex replace etc
19:08  ravenzz: yes
19:09  sKreeM: aro - or on change
19:10  aro: ok
19:10  aro: is onchange triggered when you use the mouse to paste stuff in via a right click?
19:10  sKreeM: yep
19:11  ravenzz: on keyup could help you when you use ctrl+v
19:11  sKreeM: otherwise the function would be called onchange_apartfromwhensomeonepastes
19:13  ravenzz: you can start from here
19:13  ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/VCcBR/
19:15  ravenzz: or you can replace by array
19:15  ravenzz: var replaceThis=new array('foo','fooo','ofoo');
19:16  ravenzz: var withThis=new array('bar','baaar','bar');
19:16  ravenzz: .replace(replaceThis,withThis)
19:16  l4rk: var replaceHisWithThis = ['bar','baar','bar'];
19:16  ravenzz: yep
19:16  l4rk: ravenzz: dude do not recommend new Array unless you need to initialize a blank array with a specified length
19:16  ravenzz: im in multitask
19:17  l4rk: also its new Array not new array
19:19  aro: what is that fiddle supposed to do
19:19  ravenzz: write or paste foo into the textarea

20:06  groundnuty: hey, anyone used datatables jquerry plugin, to render columns dynamicly?
20:07  b1lly: what do you mean by render columns
20:07  b1lly: like the field title or the information within the database
20:09  groundnuty: b1lly: lets say I have s table with 3 columns, I got it working to feach data with ajax. My question is it is possible to feach not only data but also columns definitons
20:09  groundnuty: b1lly: so that onec I cant generate a table with 2 columns and another time with 10 - just depending on the concent of the server response
20:10  Fabian: why cant i change .ui-resizable { position: relative;} to position absolute.
20:12  Fabian: any one here??
20:13  b1lly: groundnuty: the same way you fetch data (using a select query); there are other queries to adjust the table
20:16  groundnuty: b1lly: I'm not sure dont you mean :(. In all exampels (like this one  http://www.mccran.co.uk/examples/datatables/) there is defined <thead> part that defines what/how many columns may be recieved with the ajax request.
20:17 --- nolkyan is now known as JusticeFries
20:17  groundnuty: b1lly: my poin is, to be able to change the content of the <thead> columns count/coulmns titles etc. with data supplied by some ajax request.
20:21  b1lly: groundnuty: like I said, the same way you use SELECT * FROM table inside the ajax request
20:21  Bartzy: How can I append an element to a container, only if it doesn't exist in the container yet ?
20:21  b1lly: you can use other mysql queries to adjust the table, update the fields, and what not

20:32  DeathRayDragonLu: I want to know if the attribute is not ACTUALLY there
20:32  dabear: DeathRayDragonLu: .attr wil return both attributes and properties
20:32  DeathRayDragonLu: i see
20:32  DeathRayDragonLu: i mean, this scenario makes that clear
20:33  DeathRayDragonLu: but what if you want to just find out if the attr tag is actually missing
20:33  DeathRayDragonLu: as in <img src="nowidth.png" alt="nowidth!" />
20:34  DeathRayDragonLu: or rather <img src="nowidthattr.png" alt="nowidthattr!" /> :p

20:35  DeathRayDragonLu: I don't really care about properties in this scenario

21:00  Mixmasterxp: How do you guys test ajax calls without writing jquery? Is there a plugin of some sort?
21:00  Mixmasterxp: or do I have to write code to test?
21:03  snover: whut?
21:04  Cork[home]: Mixmasterxp: you mean a server side to test the ajax implementation in the page or what?
21:04  marcamillion: Cork[home] interesting....that might be what I mean indeed
21:04  Mixmasterxp: client side. Like a browser plugin so I can build my calls and check the result
21:04  marcamillion: is there a tool, that allows me to do a backtrace on what sections of the code produced the final output ?
21:05  Cork[home]: Mixmasterxp: firebug in firefox, or the development tools for opera and chrome
21:05  marcamillion: because what's happening is that I have an image that is too large, much larger than it shoudl be, and I am having a hard time going through it all - to figure out which section of the code is resizing this particular image
21:05  marcamillion: ?
21:06  Cork[home]: ?firebug
21:06 @bot-t: Firebug - Web Development Evolved: http://www.getfirebug.com/ , FireQuery (firebug enhancements for jQuery): http://firequery.binaryage.com/
21:06  Mixmasterxp: Cork[home]: I can create a request using firebug?
21:06  Cork[home]: no...
21:06  nlogax: yes
21:06  Cork[home]: Mixmasterxp: you would have to put breakpoints in the code, that would be the simplest way to do it
21:06  Cork[home]: then step through the code
21:07  Mixmasterxp: no, i mean I dont want to write any javascript, just a tool to make calls
21:07  Mixmasterxp: something like how web services have their tools
21:07  Cork[home]: Mixmasterxp: what browser are you using?
21:07  Mixmasterxp: firefox, chrome and ie
21:07  marcamillion: anyone care to comment on my question ?
21:08  Cork[home]: ?g firebug
21:08 @bot-t: Cork[home], Firebug - http://getfirebug.com/
21:08  Cork[home]: give it a look
21:08  marcamillion: i know firebug, but how do I get that ?
21:08  marcamillion: as in...get it to tell me which part of the code resized this image ?
21:08  Cork[home]: you would have to find a track that you know result in the image resize
21:09  Cork[home]: just earlier in the chain somewhere
21:09  Cork[home]: then add a debugger; there
21:09  marcamillion: hrmm
21:09  Cork[home]: then run the code and step until you find what changes the size
21:09  Cork[home]: there is no shourt cuts
21:09  Cork[home]: *short
21:10  marcamillion: ok
21:10  Cork[home]: cause the browsers doesn't keep any information about what changed the dom information
21:10  Cork[home]: so you can't find js from a dom element

22:05  bobsomebody: is it possible to animate font-size using 1.2.x? Im trying to port infogrid from 1.4 to 1.2 so i can plug it into drupal. I got everything working but the font size
22:05  snover: ?gl
22:05 @bot-t: http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
22:06  snover: also drupal has a 1.3 upgrade module, you should probably use it
22:06  bobsomebody: (infogrid demo: http://css-tricks.com/examples/InfoGrid/)
22:06  schz: hi everyone, this is something ive been stuck on a while, excuse my newbness to JS in general, why doesnt this work : var NEXT_RECEIPT_NUMBER = 0; $.getJSON(SERIES_URL, function(JSON) { NEXT_RECEIPT_NUMBER = JSON.next_receipt_number });
22:06  bobsomebody: snover, yeah ive got that one, i just wanted to double check it wasnt something put in on 1.4, i vaguely remember seeing it somewhere before 1.4 but i cant remember
22:07  tsyrak: hey guys, from stop: function(event, ui) in a call to resizable(), how can i access the parent of the html object being resized?
22:07  schz: after those 2 statements NEXT_RECEIPT_NUMBER is still 0
22:07  schz: im sure JSON has the correct data
22:07  bobsomebody: tsyrak, $(this).parent() wont work?
22:07  RTPMatt: ? ajax101 @ schz
22:07 @bot-t: schz, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
22:07  schz: i imagine it has something to do with the scope of the function ref im passing to getJSON, but i dont know how to fix it
22:08  Cork[home]: schz: just a side not; i would stay aways from using variables like JSON
22:08 --- oksushi|na is now known as oksushi
22:08  Cork[home]: schz: most browsers use it for native json objects function objects
22:08  schz: aaah, excellent tip
22:08  schz: thank you
22:10  bobsomebody: duh bob... fontSize... not font-size :|
22:10  bobsomebody: got it working now lol
22:10  schz: ok so basically i need a global variable that i update from a function that gets called on success ?
22:10  Cork[home]: ya
22:10  Cork[home]: well it doesn't have to be global
22:11  Cork[home]: it needs to be in the same scope as those functions you want to share the data with
22:11  schz: i get it - cork i appreciate the help, thanks
22:11  Cork[home]: and you need to remember that ajax is async, so code after the call will be run before the call is complete
22:12  tsyrak: it does work bobsomebody, thanks :)
22:14  bobsomebody: tsyrak, yw :)
22:14  Bartzy: $('#whatever').html('<iframe><img src="test.jpg"></iframe>') ; this would work ?
22:14  Bartzy: Or <iframe> must have a src ?
22:15  Cork[home]: no that won't work
22:15  Cork[home]: you can add it inline in a later call, but not inline like that
22:19  Bartzy: Cork[home] , how can I add it inline ?
22:19  Bartzy: I have no page, just want the image there, so I can issue 'print' on the iframe :| is that the way to go in order to print only the image and not the whole page ?
22:20  Cork[home]: Bartzy: as i said you can't; you can create the iframe, wait for its dom to be created then add it manualy though
22:20  Bartzy: .html() ?
22:21  Bartzy: $('<iframe></iframe>').appendTo($element).html('<img.....'); ?
22:21  Cork[home]: ya, but the problem is to get jquery to manage to get across the docuemnt borders for the iframe
22:21  Cork[home]: no
22:21  Cork[home]: you have to first add the iframe; then use settimeout so that the browser can create the dome
22:22  Cork[home]: the use $('iframe')[0]. ... shit i have forgotten the member name >_<
22:22  Bartzy: what.. why ? :|
22:22  Cork[home]: anyway you have to reach across the iframe borer
22:22  Cork[home]: Bartzy: cause the iframe is a new dom tree
22:22  Bartzy: contentWindow ?
22:22  Cork[home]: you can't add image directly in it
22:22  Cork[home]: contentDocument
22:23  Cork[home]: thats the member :)
22:23  Cork[home]: .body
22:23  Bartzy: but why use setTimeout ? How much time ?
22:23  Cork[home]: 0 ms
22:23  Cork[home]: you have to yield to let the browser create te dom
22:23  Cork[home]: thats all
22:23 --- PM|online is now known as PM|offline
22:24  Cork[home]: well browsers has a min time of 10 ms
22:24  Cork[home]: but no need to force them if they ever lower that :)
22:24  Bartzy: Cork[home] : You know any better way to print a single image ?
22:24  Cork[home]: why do you need the iframe?
22:24 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
22:25  Cork[home]: or do you mean print as in on a printer?
22:25  Bartzy: yes.
22:25  Cork[home]: ah
22:25  Bartzy: Popup the print dialog
22:26  Bartzy: But only for that image... like it's the only thing in the page
22:26  Cork[home]: i would most likly load a small html file from the server instead
22:26  Bartzy: Cork[home] the image is changing...
22:27  Bartzy: It's possible to open a popup window with the image, but that seems weird when I have the iframe option...
22:27  Cork[home]: haven't worked much with printing; specially not parts of a page (like one single image)
22:27  Bartzy: Cork[home]: I still didn't understand why 0ms is enough.. if the browser didn't create the dom tree after that time ?
22:27  Cork[home]: Bartzy: well its doable, but be prepared that iframes is a messy deal
22:27  Bartzy: why messy ? :)
22:28  Cork[home]: Bartzy: if you access the content of an iframe directly after you add it through js
22:28  Cork[home]: the sever won't have ANY time to add it, as your code doesn't end
22:29  Cork[home]: if you use setTimeout you yield your control of the process, and give the browser back the control so it can do whats needed to the new iframe
22:29  Bartzy: why the server has anything to do with it ? It's only client side
22:29  Cork[home]: never said anything about a server
22:29  Bartzy: 'The sever' ?
22:29  Bartzy: thought you meant server...
22:30  Cork[home]: when the browser executes a script block it can't do anything else
22:30  Bartzy: Oh I get it
22:30  Bartzy: $('<iframe>') is valid ? It shoudn't close with $('<iframe></iframe>') ?
22:30  Cork[home]: $('<iframe/>')
22:30  Cork[home]: but ya
22:31  Cork[home]: anyway you can't pput anything inside the html iframe tag
22:31  Cork[home]: its not valid html
22:31  Cork[home]: but you can add things to the new dom the iframe gets, when its created
22:32  Bartzy: OK.. so $('<iframe></iframe>') is fine ?
22:32  Bartzy: or $('<div></div>') ? I have a lot of those in my code
22:32  Cork[home]: all you need is $('<div/>')
22:32  Cork[home]: no need to separate the start and end tag
22:33  Bartzy: How does that work ?
22:33  Cork[home]: xml short hand tags
22:33  Cork[home]: <div></div> === <div/> and empty tag
22:34  Bartzy: oh
22:35  Bartzy: and it doesn't matter I use HTML5 ?
22:35  Cork[home]: actually your not ^^
22:35  Cork[home]: your using the dom
22:35  dilvie: Cork: browser dom manipulation is non-blocking, and it has variable completion time depending on what else the computer is doing, if the dom code is running in a separate thread, etc... you shouldn't assume that the browser will be finished with its dom manipulation in 0 ms, or 10ms for that matter. It's safer to poll for something you know will be truthy when the browser is finished with...
22:35  dilvie: ...the manipulation, and wrap your follow up code in an if block. You can then call the function inside a setTimeout in the else block. Net result: you poll in a non-blocking way, and only try to access your DOM properties when you KNOW they're available.
22:36  Cork[home]: dilvie: the matter here isn't about the time, is that if the js doesn't give up its control of the cpu the dom isn't created in the iframe
22:36  Bartzy: Also, last question (I hope! :p) - Is it posbile to create a jquery element and insert it into a container, but return the jquery element ?
22:36  Cork[home]: this is only true for iframes
22:36  Cork[home]: try it your self if you don't beleve me
22:36  Bartzy: something like $('<iframe/>').appendTo($container), but not appending ? I want the iframe to be the only element in the container.. like html.. but I want to get the <iframe> jquery object.
22:37  ss23: "Last question" - Story of my life!
22:37  Cork[home]: Bartzy: you mean like var $div = $('<div/>'); $parent.append($div); ?
22:37  Mixmasterxp: I have: <span id="lol">15</span> how do I do math on the html? for eg. minus 1 from it
22:37  Bartzy: yeah but I rather do it in 1 call ?

23:58  sone: Are you saying I do not need to tell it which element I wish to use? i.e the jsonName?
23:58 --- snover|away is now known as snover
23:58  Cork[home]: sone: no i guessed you got your json through ajax
23:58  sone: the data I am passing is already been returned as json
23:58  Cork[home]: but i might have assumed to much
23:58  Cork[home]: then why are you parsing it again?
23:59  sone: I need to loop through it to generate html
23:59  Cork[home]: if its been retured as json it should already be a json object
23:59  Cork[home]: not a string
23:59  sone: but my problem is I need a generic fucntion so I can parse different elements into html
