00:03  qq99: snufft, so animating a collection?  if it's a hackjob and needs to be done fast, then collection.each(function(){ assign each its curr height, then animate individually });
00:03  qq99: sounds like it would work
00:04 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 102 seconds
00:04  snufft: qq99: i've got a bunch of divs with a class of .right . in those divs, there's a h3 and a p, when mouseovering the h3, i want the p to appear, for that .right div only. the p's are not a set height or width, they're auto. does that clarify a little?
00:05  deanclkclk: anyone here familiar with JQGrid?
00:05  deanclkclk: please
00:06  deanclkclk: I am trying to get Integrated Toolbar Search datagrid to work in my project but, it isn't working
00:07  JeroenDeDauw: I'm looping over a certain part of the DOM using contents().each() and would like to replace certain words in text nodes with spans that contain these words. I'm not finding a way to do this. Any help?
00:07  qq99: snufft, so is p display:none?
00:08  gnarf: soreau: http://jsfiddle.net/akdcK/

00:08  bot-t: JeroenDeDauw, jQuery replaceText: String replace for your jQueries! | jQuery Plugins - jQuery replaceText will replace text in specified elements. Note that only text content will be modified, leaving all tags and attributes untouched. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-replacetext-plugin
00:08  soreau: gnarf: Wow, cool
00:08  ajpiano: JeroenDeDauw that plugin does *exactly what you just described*
00:08  snufft: qq99: pretty much. on that topic, is it better to set the css to display none, or do a $document ready hide()?
00:09  JeroenDeDauw: ajpiano: Awesome! I'll have a look at it. Thanks :)
00:09  soreau: gnarf: So why do you have two ul.menu li {}'s?
00:09  gnarf: um
00:09  gnarf: no reason
00:09  gnarf: combine em
00:09  gnarf: i was just throwing shit at it, i think it modified the old li.fadeitem or whatever
00:09  gnarf: to be ul.menu li
00:10  deanclkclk: anyone care to look into my problem..here's the code http://jsfiddle.net/yELJy/
00:10  soreau: gnarf: It seems if I remove display: block, it works the same too
00:10  gnarf: and didn't realize there already was one
00:10  gnarf: soreau: display:block is default for LI
00:10  gnarf: so yeah
00:10  soreau: ok
00:10  deanclkclk: again..I can't get JqGrid ....Integrated Toolbar Search to work
00:10  deanclkclk: not sure why
00:11  gnarf: ajpiano: now thats patience ;)
00:11  qq99: snufft: on ready hide if you've got non-js browsers, imo
00:11  soreau: gnarf: When you say 'pointer', does that mean the link pointer or the default mouse cursor?
00:11  qq99: snufft: unless it's possible to do a conditional css to target them
00:11  gnarf: ?g css cursor:pointer
00:11  bot-t: gnarf, CSS cursor property - http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_cursor.asp
00:11  ajpiano: gnarf, :))
00:12  qq99: snufft: if you don't care about no-js users, then put the hide in the css
00:12  ajpiano: soreau, you should thank gnarf a lot
00:12  gnarf: "pointer" == the finger
00:12  snufft: qq99: this is what i have at the moment, in terms of js: http://pastebin.com/ZuavK6ry
00:12  gnarf: thats probably not needed anymore either
00:12  gnarf: actually
00:12  gnarf: take that back
00:12  snufft: qq99: css it is then :)
00:12  gnarf: there is section of the button that aren't the "a"
00:12  gnarf: the 12px at top / under
00:13  qq99: snufft: so what I'd do is something like this... $(".right").each(function(){ var ref = $(this); ref.find("h3").hover(function(){ ref.find("p").show();   }, function(){ ref.find("p").hide();  });  }
00:13  gnarf: the css makes it look like a clickable link
00:13  gnarf: and the click event makes it act like one
00:13  qq99: it's a lot of mess but I hope I didn't mess it up in the irc chatinput
00:13  gnarf: maybe
00:14  gnarf: hrm
00:14  gnarf: i thought .click() on an A would navigate...
00:14  soreau: gnarf: Looks great because it's functional :) Now where is a good place to read a js tutorial?
00:15  soreau: or information that puts all three html, css and js in perspective
00:15  gnarf: soreau: the problem with most tutorials
00:15  gnarf: is they teach shit wrong
00:15  gnarf: :)
00:16  qq99: gnarf, .click on a doesn't navigate without event.preventDefault()?
00:16  qq99: sounds odd, I figured it would too
00:16  gnarf: qq99: i called .find('a').click() and its not navigating
00:16  snufft: qq99: that's heaps better than what i had :) thank you very much :)
00:16  gnarf: i mean, i know i could document.location = ...find('a').attr('href') but that seems lame
00:17  j00bar: hi! i am running $.load() with $("#id_form").serialize() as the second argument - according to the docs, shouldn't this imply POST, not GET?
00:18  tkuben: you can set if its post or get
00:18  j00bar: tkuben: how?
00:18  tkuben: hold on I did this before let me just get that code :)
00:19  j00bar: the docs for $.load() read: "The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed."
00:20  gnarf: soreau: http://jsfiddle.net/akdcK/1/ fixed the click event
00:20  soreau: gnarf: Well I meant what is the recommended way to learn js?
00:21  soreau: gnarf: And I am trying to use the code to read the image from disk but it's not reading any image at all
00:21  gnarf: soreau: i can't rightly recommend any way to learn JS -- Ive been doing it for 10 years and still feel like an idiot daily
00:21  snufft: is there a kudos function in here?
00:21  soreau: gnarf: heh - ok

00:25  j00bar: any further insight on how to for $.load() to POST instead of GET?
00:25  ajpiano: j00bar, if you pass any data
00:25  ajpiano: it will do a post
00:26  ajpiano: instead of a get, by default
00:26  j00bar: ajpiano: i did pass data. it did a GET.
00:26  j00bar: :)
00:26  ajpiano: that's weird
00:26  ajpiano: in the querystring
00:26  ajpiano: or as a data param
00:26  j00bar: i called $(fooelement).load("/some/url", $("#some_form_id").serialize());
00:26  j00bar: the result was a GET call with the form data as query args
00:27  ajpiano: hmm
00:28  ajpiano: j00bar, can you just patronise me for a sec, and try with .load("foo/bar/",{bam:"baz"})
00:28  ajpiano: see what happens?
00:28  j00bar: happy to - stand by

00:30  aziz: found out what my problem was: id attributes shouldn't contain dots. fucking took me half an hour to figure this out. stupid shit. sorry for my anger.
00:31  aziz: even though i'm not even selecting on the id attribute but on the class attr
00:31  j00bar: ajpiano: whatever it is that $(form).serialize() generates does get recognized by $.load() as POST worthy.
00:31  gnarf: ?valid id
00:31  bot-t: ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
00:31  ajpiano: it's a string
00:31  soreau: gnarf: I'm still trying to figure out how to make it work on my demo page
00:32  j00bar: ajpiano - that's probably why.
00:32  gnarf: apparently they are legal in the spec
00:32  gnarf: :)
00:32  ajpiano: j00bar, i'm trying to figure out if that's something we'd call " a bug"
00:32  gnarf: horrible for css selectors tho

00:46  soreau: what is the problem?
00:46  glen1: is there a problem with using height: "auto" in the animate function
00:47  ajpiano: yes, it doesn't work glen1
00:47  glen1: ajpiano, ahh thats why my effects looked worse than usual :P
00:47  soreau: Also the hover/fade effect is not working on my demo page
00:48  backinnam: soreau: looks like perhaps you aren't setting list-style-type: none
00:49  glen1: when using prependTo, is it possible to find the height of an element?
00:50  glen1: I am using a default height, so sometimes there is overlap
00:50  soreau: backinnam: Yes you were right.
00:50  soreau: Now I wonder why the hover/fade effect isn't working
00:52  soreau: Maybe I need some different code to load the image from disk. This is what I have: var $b = $("<img>").attr('src', 'button_bg3.png').css({

01:13  qq99: backinnam, thanks, the shadows are troubling
01:14  qq99: as it is, there is 1 on each section, but unfortunately they overlap and look superdark
01:16  ajpiano: soreau, the li's do not expand to contain absolutely positioned content
01:16  ajpiano: the images are 'on the page' but they are not visible bcause the li's are too short to show something that's offset from the top by 150 px
01:16  soreau: ajpiano: Well it isn't the problem here.. maybe I need to tell it to appear above the bg image
01:17  soreau: hmm. zindex is already set to 10
01:18  soreau: nah, that's not it either
01:18  soreau: I wonder why the js code wont load this image or why the hover/fade isn't working in my demo

01:19  soreau: backinnam: Yes, I've been asking for some good information to learn it all

01:23  ajpiano: gnarf, i tried to explain that, but soreau explained to me that that was a waste of time.
01:23  gnarf: can you upload that html somewhere so i can see it?
01:23  ajpiano: but since he likes you and hates me
01:23  soreau: gnarf: sure

01:27  gnarf: soreau: good... here is the thing
01:28  gnarf: can you just use jsfiddle for that?
01:28  gnarf: thats kinda what it was made for

01:30  soreau: gnarf: See line 63 http://pastebin.com/0BcDwW4W
01:31  soreau: I think maybe it's the wrong syntax but firebug didn't say anything
01:31  gnarf: can you tell me what difference there is between the two?
01:31  gnarf: i can begin pointing them out
01:32  soreau: gnarf: Between the working one and this one? All's I changed was the links to filenames (the one in css code works, the one in js fails) and the pix offsets for top
01:32  ajpiano: soreau: there is no document ready block
01:32  ajpiano: in this pastebin
01:33  gnarf: okay... do a view source on the /show
01:33  gnarf: the url i just posted to you
01:33  gnarf: the JS in 'jsfiddle' runs "onload"
01:34  gnarf:  $(window).load(function(){ ... });

01:35  gnarf: it deserves to be fixed
01:35  gnarf: if you wrap the whole script tag in the document ready ^^^^
01:35  ajpiano: soreau, you can only work with elements in the DOM when the DOM is "ready" or the window has loaded, which is after the dom is ready
01:36  soreau: ajpiano: I haven't got a grasp on what 'the DOM' is yet.
01:36  gnarf: ajpiano: boo for misinformation... to get even more techincal... you can only find DOM elements that EXIST
01:36  gnarf: DOM = your HTML as javascript objects
01:36  gnarf: you havent loaded your <ul> into the browser yet
01:37  gnarf: so it doesnt exist when script runs
01:37  gnarf: therefore nothing happens
01:37  soreau: gnarf: DOM = js code in the script tags?
01:37  gnarf: the script needs to run AFTER that

01:40  gnarf: soreau: jsfiddle is MEANT for you to be able to play with it
01:40  Tallisman: i = a O.o
01:40  ZoDiMMorTal: http://jsfiddle.net/XURU8/
01:40  gnarf: use it while you play
01:40  ZoDiMMorTal: done
01:40  gnarf: you could probably build a small one page site using it
01:41  Tallisman: anyhow, i had a problem - my classmates like to hack - and i do not like captcha's, is there any other way to prevent hacking? (any form of legal hacking)
01:41  soreau: gnarf: Ok last thing: the buttons displayed on the demo page are pretty far away from the left border but I don't see any left padding
01:42  soreau: gnarf: And in jsfiddle, there is almost no padding
01:42  gnarf: soreau: again, look at the source
01:42  gnarf: they include a stylesheet you don't
01:43  soreau: ok
01:43  gnarf: what the pros in the biz call a 'reset' they call a 'normalize'
01:43  gnarf: they also include the "result-light".css
01:45  Tallisman: does anyone know a alternative for captcha's? one that doesn't screw the user experience ^^?
01:45 * soreau is reading
01:46  zakwilson: Tallisman: kittenauth!
01:46  ajpiano: Tallisman, there are "captchas" that ask a simple question
01:46  ajpiano: like "What is four plus two"
01:46  ajpiano: "or "Type the first letter of this sentence"
01:46  Tallisman: hahaha, yea those are quite fun :P, however they still require extra work from the user :P
01:46  Tallisman: would use them before using a captcha though :p
01:47  zakwilson: I want to put a submit handler on a form that does an ajax call to something else, then submits the form after it completes. Is there an idiomatic way to do that? I keep writing infinite loops.
01:47  Tallisman: i'll look up kitt3nauth, brb
01:47  ajpiano: zakwilson: ?p
01:47  ajpiano: ?p
01:47  bot-t: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
01:48  zakwilson: Yeah, I was afraid of that. One moment, please.
01:48  soreau: gnarf: Cool, I guess you have to override defaults often for more control
01:48  soreau: Well thanks for everyones help, I will take a break and try to read some more
01:48  gnarf: ZoDiMMorTal: working on it
01:48  ZoDiMMorTal: ty man ^^
01:48  gnarf: soreau: browsers do some fucked up shit with margins and paddings and they ALL do it differently
01:49  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal http://jsfiddle.net/XURU8/2/
01:49  ZoDiMMorTal: I would like put a cookie and set it for 1 week (for example)
01:49  ajpiano: gnarf:  beat you to it ;)
01:49  gnarf: AGAIN
01:49 * gnarf raises fists
01:49  gnarf: thats it ajpiano
01:49  gnarf: your a bastard asshole
01:49  Tallisman: kittenauth is ingenieus XD
01:49  gnarf: ./quit
01:49  gnarf: oh damnit
01:49 * gnarf sulks in the corner
01:49  soreau: gnarf: So what is the best thing to do in order to accommodate most major browsers?
01:50  soreau: WRT padding/margins etc
01:50  gnarf: soreau: start with that normalize.css
01:50  gnarf: and work your way up
01:50  gnarf: hell
01:50  gnarf: copy theirs
01:50  ZoDiMMorTal: ok I try it in live O_O (lol very difficult code)
01:50  gnarf: or see ?g reset css
01:50  bot-t: gnarf, CSS Tools: Reset CSS - http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
01:50  richardwhiuk: gnarf: build for chrome and firefox, use selected styleshets for ie
01:50  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal, most of the code there is me inlining the cookie plugin
01:50  soreau: gnarf: You mean like - don't trust the defaults but explicitly specify what you mean via style sheets?
01:50  ajpiano: soreau, the defaults are different in every browser
01:51  ajpiano: so you have to 'reset' so that you can reliably expect it to be the same
01:51  gnarf: soreau: exactly how can you trust what you do not know?
01:51  gnarf: in fact reject it
01:51  ajpiano: soreau http://sixrevisions.com/css/the-history-of-css-resets/
01:51  gnarf: and put your will into law
01:51  Tallisman: however - youtube doesn't show any captcha data - for 3 times of sending messages - well i know that data is linked to their user account
01:51  gnarf: ?reset css
01:51  bot-t: gnarf, :reset Selector - Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
01:51  soreau: gnarf: Well I thought maybe there was some standard that browsers are supposed to follow
01:51  Tallisman: is there any way to log data from a person that did not log in?
01:51  soreau: but I guess the more information you include, the better
01:51  ajpiano: Tallisman, use cookies/localstorage
01:52  Tallisman: ip's can be faked by proxy's, cookies unset, sessions deleted
01:52  zakwilson: http://jsfiddle.net/VFBfK/ <-- using this as the submit handler makes an infinite loop. I just want to submit after the ajax post.
01:52  Tallisman: i need a method that is not hackable :P
01:53  ajpiano: Tallisman, so you don't want a captcha, or anything that otherwise causes the user to do anything... you don't want to use localstorage or cookies cause it can be hacked
01:53  ajpiano: do you suspect somoene in here has some magical super easy super safe method of authenticating that you've just never heard of?
01:53  Tallisman: maybe :P
01:54  Tallisman: it was worth the try :P
01:54  ajpiano: ;)
01:54  wald: hi
01:54  Tallisman: so the most flawless method i can think of now = looking at page traffic
01:54  ajpiano: huh
01:54  ajpiano: flawless method of what
01:55  Tallisman: of looking whether a hacking is at work, or a user :P
01:55  richardwhiuk: Tallisman: 301 redirect to a different page for each user
01:55  ajpiano: Tallisman, people don't use captchas cause they like them, they use them (or something similar) because they actually work
01:55  wald: is it possible to execute for example datepicker on ajax call ?
01:55  richardwhiuk: eg I visit yoursite.com - you 301 redirect me to yoursite.com/usertaghash/
01:55  Tallisman: not all captcha's work :p, but that is not the subject at this moment :P
01:55  ajpiano: no, of course not
01:55  richardwhiuk: you then can use the usertag as the use
01:55  richardwhiuk: *user
01:55  richardwhiuk: and use that as a session id
01:55  ajpiano: Tallisman, also, a spammy comment is different than "hacking"
01:56  richardwhiuk: it's not perfect but it's pretty good
01:56  Tallisman: what do you define as hacking?
01:56  ajpiano: it's not clear to me how a captcha prevents "hacking"
01:56  Tallisman: thanks a lot richardwhiuk :P
01:56  ajpiano: a malicious attempt by an entity to take control of a comptuer or network of computers?
01:56  Tallisman: i do not see how a website can be hacked that way :P
01:57  Tallisman: unless if you really got security holes O.o
01:57  richardwhiuk: Tallisman: you remove the user string and you've just logged out
01:57  richardwhiuk: essentially
01:57  richardwhiuk: but you are approaching security from the wrong standpoint
01:57  ajpiano: Tallisman, i just don't know what type of "hacking" you're trying to prevent by putting a captcha in place
01:57  gnarf: btw, u guys hear about this: http://www.blog.jbi.in/security/firesheep-a-packet-sniffer-that-creates-security-nightmare/
01:58  Tallisman: well, website 'hacking' :P, spamming, iritating me xD
01:58  richardwhiuk: gnarf: yes, the solution is to do SSL for the entire site
01:58  gnarf: yeah, no shit
01:58  gnarf: :)
01:58  ajpiano: Tallisman, but those are separate problems
01:58  gnarf: i personally prefer the encrypted vpn
01:58  richardwhiuk: there is a plugin out there to detect people using firesheep though
01:59  gnarf: yeah, the article mentions it too
01:59  richardwhiuk: gnarf: only protects you to the VPN endpoint
01:59  gnarf: blacksheep
01:59  Tallisman: you are right about that aj :P
01:59  Tallisman: maybe i am just - sceptical about hacking - because i have never actually been hacked :P
02:00  Tallisman: i used to define hacking - when someone stole my user account of a game i was playing when i was little - that has changed
02:00  SirFunk: hey how do you select on the name attribute if it contains [] ... like:
02:00  gnarf: richardwhiuk: im more willing to trust the packets from my office to the switch to the router to the fiber to their destination
02:01  ajpiano: Tallisman, well, if you had been, you'd know that "looking at the server logs afterward" isn't going to save you from anything
02:01  gnarf: as a site developer
02:01  gnarf: i want to offer https for anyone
02:01  SirFunk: $('input[name="customer[first_name]"]');  something like that?
02:01  ajpiano: ?escaping @ SirFunk
02:01  bot-t: SirFunk, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
02:01  SirFunk: ahh, thanks
02:02  Tallisman: i just realized however, many people have the wrong idea of the definition hacking O.o
02:03  ZoDiMMorTal: ajpiano: your code seems work only if I refresh page but if I close browser and open again it doesnt work O_O
02:03  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal, cookies are kind of brittle storage mechanism
02:04  ZoDiMMorTal: it is possible set a cookie for 1 week similar I did with my UI Tabs?
02:05  kjy112: hey guys
02:05  kjy112: does weather.yahoooapis.com support ajax cross domain?
02:05  Tallisman: yes it is possible to set a cookie for 1 week
02:06  Tallisman: (which just made me google the subject - setting cookies with javascript O.o, i always used php for cookies xD)
02:07  ZoDiMMorTal: I am using jquery.cookie on my ui tabs
02:08  ZoDiMMorTal: then I would like use it also on ui accordion and toggle effect
02:14 --- kdrsx is now known as kuadrosx
02:16  gnarf: ZoDiMMorTal: how did you set the cookie for tabs?
02:16  ajpiano: gnarf, tabs has a simple drop in cookie option
02:17  ajpiano: accordion doesn't
02:17  gnarf: boo
02:17  gnarf: fix it
02:17  ZoDiMMorTal: I took example from ui site
02:17  gnarf: want me to fix it?
02:17  ZoDiMMorTal: in ui site there was example with tabs + cookie
02:17  ajpiano: gnarf, it's planned
02:17  ajpiano: to refactor accordion to make its api more similar to tabs
02:21  gnarf: ZoDiMMorTal: it appears $.cookie(name, value, options)
02:22  gnarf: options can be {expires: 7} for 7 days
02:22  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal, did you actually try modiying the example i made for you
02:22  ajpiano: to add an expires option?
02:23  ZoDiMMorTal: yup
02:23  ZoDiMMorTal: active:parseInt($.cookie("accordionState", { expires: 7 })) || 0,
02:23  ajpiano: nope
02:23  ajpiano: wrong place
02:23  gnarf: name, value, options
02:23  ZoDiMMorTal: d'oh O_O
02:23  ajpiano: you have to put it in the part where it SETS the cookie
02:23  ajpiano: not where it READS the cookie
02:23  ajpiano: ;)
02:23  ZoDiMMorTal: I am very noob in jquery man ^^
02:24  gnarf: damn, look at ajpiano sanitizing the SHIT out of that cookie
02:24  gnarf: *fistbump*
02:24  gnarf: you forgot, ",10" tho
02:24  ajpiano: lol
02:24  gnarf: im willing to forgive
02:25  ajpiano: gnarf, if i don't parseInt it, accordion thought it was a selector
02:25  ZoDiMMorTal: gulp little help about where I must insert that?
02:25  ajpiano: and didn't match anything
02:25  gnarf: ajpiano: makes sense...
02:25  gnarf: it is a string, not a number
02:26  gnarf: i sometimes curse JS for its ability to treat those things like each other
02:30  ZoDiMMorTal: ajpiano my jquery cookie is little different O_O
02:30  ZoDiMMorTal: it is key, value, options
02:31  ZoDiMMorTal: if you want I can give you link of cookie O_O

02:42  johnline: !seen coldhead
02:42  jedimind_: yeah ive seen him around, just havent been around recently myself

02:42  toph: ok, but have you seen him in the last few days or so?
02:42  toph: last 3 maybe?

02:46  jedimind_: lol
02:46  vladikoff: jedimind, >:|
02:47  Tallisman: hey.. jedimind_, do you know if it is possible to define a IP'adress wrong or right? by pinging maybe?
02:47  Tallisman: i am looking for a way to divide a proxy from a reall ip
02:48  Tallisman: it doesn't have to be 100% flawless, if it has 1% correctness it could already help :P
02:48  toph: guys
02:49  toph: moments later, coldhead called us and told us that he didnt have  reception
02:49  jedimind_: vladikoff, what?!
02:49  toph: so dont worry
02:49  toph: we hadnt been able to contact him, but he just called us
02:49  jedimind_: toph, okay, tell him that i love him when you talk to him next
02:49  jedimind_: and that iw as worried
02:49  jedimind_: and that im glad he's okay
02:49  toph: ahha alright then :)
02:49  toph: cyas
02:49  jedimind_: Tallisman, what do you mean?
02:50  jedimind_: you mean for the sake of validating a form? or for some other reason?
02:50  jedimind_: because any other reason would have to be done server side and not applicable to jquery
02:50  Tallisman: yea, it could also be done with php
02:50  Tallisman: but i was simple wondering, it is indeed for validation
02:51  jedimind_: well you can just do simple regexp validation
02:51  jedimind_: that's server side
02:51  Tallisman: will a proxy server return a different regexp than a normal ip service?
02:51  jedimind_: i mean pretty much every IP address in existence is already used
02:51  jedimind_: what?
02:51  jedimind_: ok step back, what exactly are you trying to do ?
02:52  Tallisman: i am trying to distinquis a reall ip from someone with a fake ip :P
02:52  jedimind_: what is a "fake" ip ?
02:52  jedimind_: and how are you gathering the information?
02:52  jedimind_: is it a form, and you're asking people to enter their IP address?
02:53  Tallisman: no :P, i use serverside to get their ip :P
02:53  jedimind_: so then you need something server side to validate it, but how exactly are you going to check if it's "fake"
02:53  Tallisman: after that i want to know whether it is reall or not, and thereby deside whether to let them register/ or not
02:53  jedimind_: what does "fake" mean
02:53  jedimind_: i mean as long as its 255.255.255.255 and lower, it's "real"

03:06  Tallisman: a failed project happens to all of us
03:06  openstandards: get yourself a good gas powered BB gun that would be more fun and more productive Tallisman
03:06  gnarf: Tallisman: stack overflow pops a captcha if you try to edit / post more than x number of items every y minutes
03:06  openstandards: or even a good paint ball gun

03:10  jedimind_: http://www.pud.ca/beta-v7a/ is the new folio if youre curious, just working on content still
03:10  jedimind_: so it's just temp content
03:10  Tallisman: i see Z to :P
03:11  Tallisman: checking it out ^^
03:12  Tallisman: hahaha, the scrollbar controll confused me for a moment :P
03:12  Tallisman: i expected to see new content :P
03:12  Tallisman: you got it nice on one page however
03:13  jedimind_: yeah, no need to have more than needed :)
03:13  jedimind_: plus each project expands and has a ton more content
03:13  jedimind_: well... not right now, but will when i launch :)
03:13  Tallisman: :]
03:13  ajpiano: jedimind_, you did the win7 meetups site?!
03:13  jedimind_: ajpiano, yup, not the design, just coded it
03:14  jedimind_: it's finished now though :(
03:14  jedimind_: we do about 3.5-4mil/year for microsoft stuff
03:14  SirFunk: why would: $('select[name="customer\\[state\\]"]').val('NY');  not set the value of the select but .val() returns 'DE' .. but setting it to NY does nothing
03:14  ajpiano: yah, i remember that site
03:14  gnarf: jedimind_: i quit
03:15  gnarf: :)

03:21  Krinkle: the $(data).find() doesn't return
03:21  Krinkle: data is the entire response including <html>, I guess that's the problem
03:22  SirFunk: man, why can i not change what is displayed in this <select>!!!
03:22  SirFunk: i set it with .val but it does nothing!
03:23  Krinkle: SirFunk: Can you jsbin.com inize the script you have ?
03:23  Tallisman: $( ''#elementone" ).load( <-- that doesn't look that good to me, single, single, selector, double?, might be mistaken though
03:23  ajpiano: Krinkle, if i were you, i'd just use $.get or something and parse al the content out
03:23  SirFunk: Krinkle: uhh.. yeah it might take me a while.. hangon
03:23  ajpiano: instead of using .load() at all
03:24  Krinkle: ajpiano: I use load() because it does a lot of smart stuff (like stripping out script-tags etc. )
03:24  Krinkle: it's not just a rerouting to $.get() and then html() the selector
03:24  Krinkle: it does more
03:25  ajpiano: Krinkle: tried .load("Foo.php #bar,#baz") by any chance?
03:25  Krinkle: ajpiano: That would load both into one element
03:27  ajpiano: Krinkle, looked at the source for .load?
03:27  ajpiano: it doesn't really do anything that *magic* that you couldn't emulate in your own $.get callback
03:27  ajpiano: OH BTW Krinkle
03:27  ajpiano: ben_alman finished a plugin that might be useful to you the other day
03:27  ajpiano: for parsing entire html documenets with $()
03:28  ajpiano: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
03:28  Krinkle: ajpiano: Thanks
03:28  Krinkle: is the rscript-variable available publicly ?
03:28  Krinkle: I'm not sure how to grab it
03:29  ZoDiMMorTal: ajpiano if ask you support for last cookie in "toggle effect" do you beat me?? Q_Q
03:29  SirFunk: Krinkle: http://jsbin.com/epefe3/edit
03:30  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal, i barely even know whare you're talking about
03:31  ajpiano: Krinkle, that regex is private
03:31  ZoDiMMorTal: with your support cookie about accordion works very good
03:31  ajpiano: ZoDiMMorTal, so here's a crazy idea
03:31  ZoDiMMorTal: and ty for your time
03:31 --- ezra-g is now known as ezra-g|afk
03:31  ajpiano: why don't you look at how i created that cookie
03:31  ajpiano: and try to make one yourself
03:32  ZoDiMMorTal: yap I am trying man ^^
03:32  ajpiano: Krinkle, jquery isn't going to execute the scripts unless you insert them in the dom with a regular $.get, why do you have to strip them?
03:34  Krinkle: ajpiano: Okay, I'll see
03:35  ajpiano: .load("url selector") just happens to strip them for you
03:35  ajpiano: the reason your $(data).find() is failing, is, i think because of docs#7784
03:35  bot-t: [#7784] $(str) is failing when str is an entire html document (closed bug: duplicate) - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784
03:37  SirFunk: Krinkle: checking out my code? it should work i don't get it
03:37  Krinkle: SirFunk: I'm looking at it, something is going strange
03:39  tzy: hi...
03:39  SirFunk: Krinkle: if i simplify the select it works fine
03:39  SirFunk: if i get rid of the customer[] stuff
03:39  SirFunk: that's WEIRD
03:39  tzy: i have $("#datepicker_from").datepicker({dateFormat:'yy-mm-dd'});   });
03:40  SirFunk: Krinkle: http://jsbin.com/apovu3/edit  works fine
03:40  tzy: how to set the default date to today ?
03:40  Krinkle: SirFunk: Have you heard of <optgroup> ?
03:40  SirFunk: Krinkle: nope.. what's that?
03:40  ajpiano: SirFunk, i was gonna ask the same thng, but was trying to figure out what's going on
03:40  ajpiano: SirFunk, what does it sound like :p
03:40  ajpiano: it's for grouping options ina  select
03:41  SirFunk: hehe, i'll read up on it
03:41  SirFunk: but it shouldn't make a difference here
03:41  ajpiano: no, of course not
03:41  SirFunk: yeah using a simpler select everything works fine.... that doesn't make sense
03:41  SirFunk: that i can get the .val with the other select but i can't set it
03:42 --- tpratt_ is now known as tpratt
03:42  Krinkle: What I find weird is that the result of the following line is 0
03:42  Krinkle: select  .find( 'option[selected]' ).size()
03:43  Krinkle: it should be 1
03:44  ajpiano: i'm trying to dupe this in a super simple case
03:48  gnarf: its been fun everyone
03:50  ajpiano: SirFunk: couldn't dupe the behaviour http://jsfiddle.net/PMwB6/1/
03:53  SirFunk: ajpiano: so what's wrong in my code?
03:54  ajpiano: i donno
03:54  ajpiano: i was just eliminating the possiblity it was a jQuery Bug
03:57  SirFunk: ahh
04:09  ajpiano: hmm
04:09  ajpiano: or maybe it is
04:10  lind: Hi
04:10  ekkis: anyone here using the layout plugin?  I can't figure out how to tell it to use a given cursor.....
04:10  lind: Can someone give me a jumpstart at jquery. I want to read out a class of an element and change it accordingly. I have no Ide how to read out the classname
04:10  ekkis: I set it in CSS but it overrides my selection...
04:11  ajpiano: $("#foo").attr("class") lind
04:13  lind: ajpiano, i get null when i do that. the element looks like this <div id="sider1" class=".sider_normal"></div>
04:13  ajpiano: lind, don't put a period in the actual attribute
04:13  ajpiano: class="slider_normal"
04:13  lind: that was a typo
04:13  lind: I dont have the . inside the div
04:14  ajpiano: do you have a document ready block
04:14  lind: Yes and the inner function is started with $(document).ready(rotate_digits());
04:14  ajpiano: nope
04:14  ajpiano: it's running before documetn ready
04:15  lind: aha
04:15  ajpiano: $(document).ready(rotate_digits)

04:24  Taggnostr: when I do e.g. how can loop through all the tr of a table and then edit the first th (in two steps)? I tried for (tr in $('tr')) { th = tr.find('th:first-child'); } but it gives error on tr.find

04:24  ralphholzmann: omg @ dicks
04:25  gf3: Taggnostr: UR DOIN IT RONG
04:25  iszak: Taggnostr, hey!
04:25  iszak: Wow, I haven't seen you in ages.
04:25  Taggnostr: hey iszak
04:25  iszak: Didn't you use to be in #regex? what happened?
04:26  Taggnostr: gf3, yep, that's what the error console is telling me
04:26  ajpiano: Taggnostr, use .each() to iterate a jquery object, not a for in loop
04:26  iszak: for loop is pro tho
04:26  Taggnostr: ajpiano, let me try
04:26  gf3: Taggnostr: or just look for the <th> directly
04:27  iszak: $('table th:nth-child') that shit
04:27  Taggnostr: gf3, I also need to check the next tr so it should be easier to find the tr and then check with next() and find
04:27  iszak: Taggnostr, so why aren't you in #RegEx anymore?
04:28  Taggnostr: iszak, I changed a few PCs, operative systems and irc clients and #regex and several other chans got lost in the process
04:29  iszak: how can you forgot about #regex when you've got a bot in there.
04:31  ajpiano: SirFunk, it was a jQuery bug after all, but it's been fixed already
04:31  SirFunk: haha.. ok
04:31  SirFunk: ajpiano: thanks for checking into it
04:32  ajpiano: SirFunk this test breaks on 1.4.4, succeeds on latest GIT http://jsfiddle.net/PMwB6/5/
04:32  Taggnostr: I didn't forget it, it's just that I haven't set up the ajoin list and now I'm just in a few chans and I join others when I need them
04:32  ajpiano: if you want to see for yourself
04:34  SirFunk: ajpiano: cool, thanks. I'm just going to give it a simpler ID and select for it by that for now :)

04:54  iszak: ajpiano, can I see your internal work plz?
04:54  iszak: kthnxbai
04:54  ajpiano: lol
04:54  ajpiano: are you coming onto me
04:54  ajpiano: :p
04:54  iszak: No, if I were I'd say, can I see your internals

04:55  Tallisman: lol, i must admit, that slide is pretty complicated.
04:56  ajpiano: Tallisman, the 14th slide is the cool one, where it shows the widget in action
04:56  Tallisman: i saw it yea ^^
04:56  Krinkle: Is there a way to make .load() ignore if a page returned a 404 error code ? I'm trying to AJAX-fy a theme, but the error pages aren't being loaded when I click a broken link
04:56  ajpiano: ;)
04:56  ajpiano: Krinkle, nope
04:56  Krinkle: ie. just load the HTML anyway (since there's a custom 404 error page)
04:56  ajpiano: it works on success only
04:56  Tallisman: i didn't see immediatly i could interact with it
04:56  Tallisman: but i did find it :P

04:58  Krinkle: ajpiano: oops, didn't mean to PM
04:58  Krinkle: It's funny. Someone in this channel goes to #mediawiki and asks something, I answer (there) then I go here (#jquery) and ask something else (which he most likely knows)
04:58  ajpiano: ohh
04:58  ajpiano: ok
04:58  Tallisman: but alright, i couldn't understand it all, which is not about the slide but my very noobish jquery knowledge :], also my age is young, which is a good thing, cause otherwise i couldn't say my age is young and relate my newbieness to my age XD
04:58  Krinkle: ajpiano: Hm. okay, so no 404 load(). Can it be done with $.get() though ?
04:58  ajpiano: Krinkle, with $.ajax
04:58  Krinkle: ajpiano: That would call the error callback, right ?
04:59  thanhhx: a
04:59  thanhhx: next
04:59  Krinkle: so I'd have to somehow alias the error callback to the succes calback.
04:59  Krinkle: That's doable
04:59  Krinkle: A solution is better than no solution :)
04:59  thanhhx: good
05:00  ajpiano: donno if he's done it
05:00  ajpiano: whop
05:00  ajpiano: Krinkle, use the complete callback
05:00  ajpiano: fires after both success and error
05:01  Krinkle: ajpiano: nice
05:01  Krinkle: also passes "data" ?
05:02  ajpiano: no :/
05:02  ajpiano: passes the full xhr and some other params
05:02  ajpiano: you can get the content from xhr.responseText or responseXML or something like that
05:02  Krinkle: but it's different per browser, hence jquery passes data to some funtions
05:03  ajpiano: well, it doesn't pass it to complete :p

05:56  boaz: :D
05:56  boaz: I wish I could debug for you right now, but I can't
05:57  boaz: even if it did work in ff, it would be bogged down with how slow ff is

06:00  boaz: sorry, didn't read  the whole thread
06:00 * CRUM googles jquery to find out what all the excitement is about
06:00  ajpiano: lol
06:00  boaz: uh, so, http://code.bocoup.com/dataurl uses window.FileReader which is definitely not x browser
06:01  metaxyy: Is there a way to run a call back at the *beginning* of a fadeIn, just after the element is laid out?
06:01  templaedhel: Yea, thats what I gathered from reading the breakdown underneath.
06:01  CRUM: ahhh jQuery is a tool to "write less, do more"
06:01  metaxyy: I.e., it normally does <set display: block or whatever> <fade opacity from 0 to 100> <call callback>
06:01  metaxyy: But I want <set display: block or whatever> <call ballback> <fade opacity from 0 to 100>
06:01  boaz: ... but it should work in ff
06:01  boaz: idk, it just crashed my ff
06:01  metaxyy: Because I want to fade a button in already focused.
06:01  boaz: :p
06:01  ajpiano: metaxyy, just do it ... before you call fadeIn
06:02  metaxyy: ajpiano: See above. You presumably can't focus an item set display: none, right?
06:02  boaz: templaedhel: uh, it seems to work in my ff
06:02  templaedhel: boaz: Isnt filereader in ff slow, because it reads the whole file into the memory? Let me try a smaller file.
06:02  ajpiano: focus?
06:02  boaz: the crash was b/c I used a big file
06:03  ajpiano: metaxyy, hm, you might want to use fadeTo or animate opacity
06:03  ajpiano: instead of using fade in and fade out
06:03  ajpiano: this way the elements never disappear?
06:03  boaz: templaedhel: try this: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2675685608_83931618ee.jpg
06:03  templaedhel: boaz:  Even with a small file it freezes up quickly, but something is definitely happening.
06:04  boaz: yeah, the problem with dataurls is that they KILL the runtime if you try to store them in the dom
06:04  metaxyy: ajpiano: Yeah, I guess that's the easiest way.
06:04  boaz: templaedhel: can you load this file into your ff ?: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2675685608_83931618ee.jpg
06:05  metaxyy: Of course, I don't want the button to be clickable, so I'd have to disable the button before it's faded in.

07:13  Taggnostr: so I have the elements like this: X y y z y z K W X z z y K X y W. Now I have the X and I want to take all the y and z after the X but stop when it find a K a W or whatever other element/class that is not y or z
07:14  qq99: wookiehangover, is there some kind of doc that explains the whole thing?  I would rather not float
07:14  Tallisman: i never know what html is going to do, i mostly experiment till i'm happy with the result..
07:14 --- eoss_ is now known as eoss
07:15  wookiehangover: qq99: I've actually never seen a comprehensive explanation all the silly, contradictory css rules
07:15  Taggnostr: is there some interactive jquery thing where I can try out snippets of code?
07:15  Tallisman: jes
07:16  Tallisman: jsfiddle
07:16  qq99: Tallisman, yeah that's it
07:16  qq99: wookiehangover it's frustrating, trying to make my own version of jScrollPane atm
07:16  Taggnostr: thanks Tallisman
07:16  Tallisman: np
07:16  wookiehangover: but I'm sure paul irish will make a micro site for it
07:16  wookiehangover: someone lazyweb that for me
07:17  qq99: lazyweb?
07:17  wookiehangover: ?g paul irish lazyweb
07:17  bot-t: wookiehangover, A call for development help and research: Lazyweb Requests Â« Paul ... - http://paulirish.com/2010/lazyweb-requests/
07:17  qq99: sounds like I need to read the w3 docs and hope people adhered :/
07:18  qq99: so is lazyweb just like a call to arms to work on open source software?
07:18  qq99: organized inside that github project?
07:18  wookiehangover: qq99: in general, if you need a display:block node to auto-size to fit it's child's content, floating or overflow:hidden will get you there
07:19  wookiehangover: nb about floating: the children need to be floated too
07:19  wookiehangover: but it's cool if that's not relevant to your interests
07:20  Tallisman: to my opinion everything needs to be opensource ^^, certainly to the general public, it is in business where people must make their money in
07:20  wookiehangover: and lazyweb is exactly what it sounds like. pitch ideas for other ppl to build
07:20  wookiehangover: Tallisman: ^^ double true
07:20  qq99: wookiehangover, that's the thing, the parent is display:block, and yet.. hang on let me just upload the example lol
07:21  Tallisman: lollol, so someone posts a idea to lazyweb, and someone else can use those?
07:21  Tallisman: that is like reversed copyright xD
07:21  Tallisman: not a bad initiative though
07:22  qq99: the top of the block element, ui-scrollpane-pane, the parent, is below the top of the margin of the <p> inside it!  http://anthonycameron.com/personal/pane_test.html
07:23  qq99: I thought margin would push the p inside downward
07:23  qq99: but instead, the parent is pushed down
07:23  qq99: even though it's the same size as its own parent
07:23  wookiehangover: dude you should float
07:23  wookiehangover: trust me
07:24  Tallisman: float or absolute :P, float is easyer :P, absolute is a bitch te center
07:24  qq99: hm
07:24  Tallisman: just float :)
07:24  Tallisman: it isn't there for nothing :P
07:25  wookiehangover: fuck it, just use a table >_<
07:25  qq99: I figured overflow:hidden would prevent things from clipping into the padding of the parent too :S
07:25  Tallisman: roflmao xD
07:26  Tallisman: yea tables are awsome to do development in - lie.. lie.. lie.. xD
07:26  wookiehangover: I was actually forced into using tables yesterday
07:26  Tallisman: really?
07:26  Tallisman: how?
07:26  wookiehangover: I tried to pass the buck and say I didn't know how
07:26  wookiehangover: but my pair made me do it
07:26  Tallisman: O.O
07:26  wookiehangover: to his defense it was tabular data
07:27  Tallisman: oh :p
07:27  Tallisman: well, using tables where tables are ment to be used is a good excuse
07:27  Tallisman: :P
07:27  wookiehangover: I've had table styling go really, really badly in the past
07:28  Tallisman: :]
07:28  Tallisman: tables are in fact the most horrible things one could imagine, however they are pretty neat at certain tasks :P
07:29  wookiehangover: I think that css columns/grid will go along way to achieving my goal of never having to use them
07:29  wookiehangover: but that won't be until 2025 when IE8 stops being supported
07:30  qq99: you're gonna give me nightmares ;P
07:30  Tallisman: aaaaah, nightmares, what are those?
07:30  wookiehangover: IE6 is supported until 2014
07:30  qq99: ugh
07:30  Tallisman: i haven't had those since i was a little kid :P, does that make me special?
07:30  qq99: not with me it isn't lol
07:30  Tallisman: 2014 isn't that long to wait for :)?
07:31  Tallisman: we have had that horrible browser for soooo long, let's not linger in the dark till it is gone xD
07:31  wookiehangover: not when you charge double to build for IE6
07:32  qq99: that I would do
07:32  wookiehangover: it easily adds 30% onto any front end build
07:32  Tallisman: O.o
07:32  Tallisman: yea i understand
07:32  wookiehangover: unless you use IE6 as your primary dev environment
07:32  Tallisman: i don't work for clients xD
07:32  qq99: half the time in IE6, a smaller portion in IE7/8
07:32  Tallisman: quess i am afraid to do so.
07:32  wookiehangover: but if you do that, I'm so sorry
07:33  Tallisman: actually it is smart to use IE6 as primary dev enviroment
07:33  wookiehangover: lol ok
07:34  Tallisman: you rule the worst, then have a easy time doing the rest :D
07:34  qq99: I wouldn't say smart
07:34  wookiehangover: with all of those legendary MS developer tools it comes with
07:34  wookiehangover: oh wait...
07:34  Tallisman: smart.. well, my stumic hurts, alot.. maybe 3 liters of coke indeed is to much.., anyhow, not smart :P
07:35  Tallisman: but it would be fun :]
07:35  Taggnostr: why the first next returns an object even if nothing matches? http://jsfiddle.net/Dm8ME/1/

07:35  Taggnostr: what is console.log?

07:36  ajpiano: i was about to link that :p
07:36  wookiehangover: whoops, thats ^ correct
07:36  ajpiano: Taggnostr, all jQuery traversal methods return a jQuery object
07:37  ajpiano: you have to test the .length of a jQuery object to see if contains any elements
07:37  wookiehangover: ajpiano: great site / preso btw
07:37  Taggnostr: ajpiano, thanks, that's what I needed to know :)
07:37  ajpiano: thx wookiehangover :)
07:37  ajpiano: Taggnostr, you also need to know what console.log is
07:37  ajpiano: alert is not a debugging method
07:38  ajpiano: wookiehangover: it's also at ?ftj btw ;)
07:38  Tallisman: ajpiano, is it wrong to say i love you know? anyhow, alert has always done the trick for me :P
07:38  Taggnostr: ajpiano, I'll look at it
07:38  Tallisman: now*
07:38  ajpiano: Tallisman: :)
07:38  Tallisman: awsome site
07:39  Tallisman: webkitinspector does not return all errors :P
07:40  temp01: it does?
07:40  temp01: not?
07:40  Tallisman: i keep track of em all the time, they help with ethics, but it does not return all kind of mistakes :P
07:40  temp01: does it not?
07:41  Tallisman: i must say, most of my problems are more logically than programmatically
07:41  folklore2: heh
07:42  qq99: wookiehangover, aha, instead of float, clear:both on parent does the trick
07:42  qq99: I did not know margins could collapse upon each other :/
07:42  wookiehangover: qq99: killer
07:42  wookiehangover: ya css is strange
07:43  wookiehangover: has anyone lazyweb'ed the all-css-rules-with-examples-and-explanations microsite yet?
07:43  Tallisman: never know debugger; what a command.
07:43  Tallisman: was***
07:44  qq99: almost sounds like a wiki would be helpful for that lazyweb
07:44  wookiehangover: fork it and make it a wiki ;)
07:44  qq99: maybe when I get some free time :P
07:44  wookiehangover: i would but I'm far too lazy
07:45  wookiehangover: plus http://gif.ly is getting re-written between now and january
07:45  qq99: speaking of gifs, I dunno why ppl even use them anymore, can get better resolution/framerate AND sound with videos nowaday
07:45  qq99: for the same filesize
07:46  wookiehangover: lol the whole point is that they're anachronistic
07:47  qq99: oh man the little "gifly" animating in was tripping me out, thought I was seeing things at first
07:48  wookiehangover: http://gif.ly/gif/383
07:53  folklore2: lol
07:54  Tallisman: just learned html has a tag called <dl> O.o
07:54  eponym: Tallisman: it's a wonderful tag.
07:55  wookiehangover: be careful with those in IE6
07:55  wookiehangover: cannot be floated
07:55  eponym: Fuhgeddabout IE6.
07:55  wookiehangover: i mean really, if you're an IE6 user, aren't you used to things being slow and looking like shit
07:56  Tallisman: well, since we build stuff for ie6, i quess not :P
07:56  eponym: This function is doing almost exactly what I expect it to, but when I log the output 'undefined' shows up in addition to the returned array. I think it has to do with the ternary operator, but I'm not sure. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/Gr6gPS5c
07:56  Tallisman: anyhoe.. what is <dl>'s main purpose?
07:56  wookiehangover: definition list
07:57  wookiehangover: like a dictionary or an FAQ
07:57  eponym: Tallisman: But really it's just great for key/value pairs.
07:57  Tallisman: got that far :], so <dl> can be used for very important content? static
07:57  wookiehangover: eponym: is the taskId always truthy/falsy
07:58  eponym: wookiehangover: it is either a string or it is not passed.
07:59  wookiehangover: eponym: you should use find() instead of chaining children()
07:59  wookiehangover: ? find
07:59  bot-t: .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
07:59  wookiehangover: eg, find('.li .task')
08:00  Tallisman: sometimes i think you guys made jquery xD, the amount you know about it is huge, just huge
08:00  wookiehangover: eponym: also, doing .parent().children('ol) can be a .siblings('ol')
08:02  eponym: If I do find("li .task") won't that get all .tasks that are subordinate to li's?
08:02  wookiehangover: yes
08:02  Tallisman: :first
08:02  Tallisman: :last, .eq
08:02  eponym: Each <li> contains a <div class="task"> which has a sibling <ol>
08:02  wookiehangover: but it's literally the same result as what you're doing
08:03  eponym: They can be nested. I only want the first level
08:03  qq99: .closest?
08:03  qq99: never used it myself
08:04  Tallisman: .closest? O.o, how can something be closer than the other..?
08:04  eponym: The sibling ol might contain more li's with .task's and ol's
08:04  wookiehangover: root.find('li > .task')
08:04  wookiehangover: can you jsfiddle this
08:04  qq99: so you've got recursive ols?
08:04  eponym: Yes
08:04  qq99: and you just want the very first one? or all siblings
08:04  qq99: or the first sibling
08:04  qq99: or what
08:05  eponym: I'm not really having a problem with the selectors, the problem is just it returning undefined in addition to the array that is coming up perfectly.
08:05  wookiehangover: how do you mean?
08:05  qq99: try the x ? y : z with variables instead of direct calls to $(..)?
08:06  qq99: does undefined appear in console before or after the object?
08:06  eponym: If I pop open console and do: var d = outlineGetChildOrder("4d1345c40d3145ad07000004"), I get the output: [exactly the array I expect] then on the next line undefined
08:06  eponym: after
08:06  wookiehangover: dude, that's normal
08:06  eponym: It is?
08:06  eponym: facepalm
08:07  qq99: in firebug?
08:07  qq99: lose the 'var' for firebug
08:07  eponym: Safari
08:07  qq99: I don't think you need to declare var in console
08:07  wookiehangover: you still should
08:07  wookiehangover: but it gets attached to the window anyway
08:07  qq99: in firebug I know it will make things odd
08:07  wookiehangover: bs
08:08  qq99: try it, any page, "var test = 's';"
08:08  qq99: will spit out undefined
08:08  qq99: sorry that's what I meant by odd
08:08  eponym: I'm an idiot. Thanks.
08:08 --- ged_ is now known as ged
08:10  wookiehangover: qq99: I think it just can't accessed a variable as it's declared
08:10  wookiehangover: unless you don't use var
08:10  wookiehangover: then it can see it from the window before it executes the line

08:26  qq99: o.o
08:27  qq99: it has gained sentience?
08:27  JusticeFries: the ackermann function is a recursive mathematical function that gets really big, really fast.

08:35  Taggnostr: also that doesn't match whole words
08:35  ajpiano: it doesn't?
08:36  Taggnostr: only whole words*
08:36  Tallisman: slow caps.. delete the c, replace it by the first letter of the first word, and put b before the stripped slow. you have now got a really horrid sentence.
08:36  ajpiano: ?tias @ Taggnostr
08:36  bot-t: Taggnostr, Try It And See
08:37  Taggnostr: it's in the example
08:37  Taggnostr: maybe it's easier to copy the headers I need in the class
08:37  ajpiano: it will perform a lot better
08:37  ajpiano: than custom attribute parsing

08:41  paraschopra: I create an alias of JQuery object like this:  var vwo_$ = jQuery.noConflict(true);
08:41  paraschopra: the problem is plugins don't seem to work
08:41  paraschopra: speficially http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag/
08:41  paraschopra: how can I make plugins work with the vwo_$ notation instead of $
08:41  temp01: paraschopra: why are you using 'true' parameter
08:41  temp01: that's extereme and hardcore
08:43  paraschopra: So you recommend using no parameter?
08:43  paraschopra: Will plugin work then?
08:44  initself_: there was a freaking number 8 somehow just in the middle of my freaking code
08:45  paraschopra: doesn't seem like working..
08:45  temp01: paraschopra: yes, it will
08:45  temp01: that plugin should work
08:46  temp01: if you use jQuery.noConflict()
08:46  temp01: since it uses jQuery and aliases it to $
08:46  temp01: paraschopra: does it work if you don't use noConflict?
08:47  paraschopra: yES
08:47  paraschopra: If I use $ directly it works
08:47  temp01: how do you use $ directly
08:47  temp01: pastebin the code that you are using
08:47  temp01: you can't use $
08:47  temp01: you need to use jQuery
08:48  paraschopra: One point to note is that the page already have JQuery 1.2 and I inject JQuery 1.4.2 with the alias vwo_$ -- my idea is to use plugin with vwo_$ and not $ or JQuery
08:48  temp01: what
08:48  wookiehangover: >_<
08:48  temp01: you are using two versions of jquery and not even on of them is latest
08:48  paraschopra: No, sorry JQuery 1.4.4
08:49  paraschopra: It is a bit of a different situation. You see the page loaded in my app can be any page on the web
08:49  paraschopra: it can already have JQuery or no JQuery
08:49  temp01: the plugin will bind to the variable 'jQuery'
08:49  paraschopra: but my app relies on JQuery to do some changes on the page
08:49  temp01: the only way to change that would be to modify the source
08:49  paraschopra: Yes, I see something like pinit=i.dropstart=i.dropend=b})(jQuery);
08:49  paraschopra: in plugin code
08:50  paraschopra: but when I change jQuery to vwo_$, it stops working
08:50  temp01: do you have a live page
08:50  temp01: there are references to jQuery inside the code
08:51  qq99: in jQuery widget, is _init auto-called after _create?
08:51  temp01: you can do <script load-new-jquery.js><script>$144 = $.noConflict();</script><script loadplugin><script>jQuery = $;</script>
08:51  qq99: nvm, seems so
08:51  temp01: wait that won't work
08:53  paraschopra: Yes, there was one reference of JQuery
08:53  paraschopra: within the plugin code
08:53  paraschopra: I have changed it, lets see if it works
08:53  temp01: i see 3 including the last })(jQuery)
08:55  paraschopra: yes, changed all
08:55  paraschopra: getting a weird error while dragging

10:27  ocf: alright... http://jsfiddle.net/ax6Vg/1 - the JS adds a listener called caMouseOver that currently displays a tooltip on hover. Effectively what I want to do is add 'cursor:pointer' when you hover over a circle element (see HTML - output of google visualization API)... $('circle').hover doesn't fire, so I don't know where I should be putting my css
10:27  ocf: I added the caMouseOver code just in case there's a way to do it in the listener too

11:06  sean`: Accelerator, you don't have an element with class scrollPage
11:07  Accelerator: Ahhh, I see, thank you!
11:07  ocf: yup
11:07  ocf: on your a tags
11:07  ocf: damn you sean` - can't I get a chance to help out? at least on the easy ones?
11:07  sean`: Accelerator, change $('.scrollPage') to $('a[href^="#"]')
11:07  sean`: ocf, I don't see you asking me questions
11:08  ocf: sean` - i didn't say "answer me" i said "me answer them" :)
11:08  ocf: you're too fast
11:08  sean`: oh
11:08  sean`: lol
11:08  sean`: ocf, http://dev.seankoole.com/jquery/ui-effect/text.html --> the first lorum on build/disintegrate starts on top0, left0
11:09  sean`: fix it
11:09  Accelerator: http://docs.icyrc.com/ ^^ Thanks sean` and ofc :)
11:10  ocf: sean` - whats wrong with top0, left0?
11:10  sean`: ocf,
11:11  sean`: it's notit's position
11:11  sean`: I get the offset of the word/char, but it's put to 0,0 instead of what it's supposed to be
11:12  ocf: hmm... i think I said "at least on the easy ones" :-D
11:14  sean`: ocf, it's not hard
11:15  ocf: I don't understand wtf you're asking. maybe I should say "the non-i-am-a-retard" ones
11:15  ocf: it looks fine to me
11:15  ocf: the examples
11:15  ocf: i'm not sure what its supposed to look like, so I have no context
11:18  sean`: ocf, check the console
11:18  sean`: if you click on 'build by word'
11:21  sean`: only happens in chrome though
11:25  CRUM: is there a larger market in doing jquery web programming, or is there a larger market with making executable programs with c c++ java and sort of thing
11:26  ocf: well the market for the latter is definitely going to be bigger
11:26  ocf: but the supply of coders in that market is going to be much bigger as well
11:26  sean`: CRUM, people are moving more to the web now a days
11:27  sean`: but the web can't be made possible without the latter
11:27  sean`: so.. either way you're good
11:27  sean`: the latter languages will probably make you a higher steady income
11:27  ocf: and, yes, I'd agree with sean`'s first point - there's a definite trend towards a 'connected web' model.
11:27  ocf: and again with his last
11:27  sean`: and CRUM jquery is not a programming language, it's a javascript library, so you should ask about javascript
11:28  sean`: also, you should see a fortuneteller, 'cause I can't tell your future
11:28  ocf: web is more fun though
11:31  CRUM: sean` that was a pretty rude answer
11:31  sean`: CRUM, which part?
11:32  CRUM: oh nevermind I'm being over sensative
11:32  CRUM: thanks for the honest answer!
11:32  sean`: right

13:13  carls: hello, i need some support. I'm trying to show a beauty tip with JQuery, but seems that css property of the element "display:none" not works in chrome. Anyone has dealed with this error?
13:19  benlangfeld: carls: display: none; definitely works in Chrome
13:20  temp01: really?
13:20  temp01: chrome supports css?!
13:20  benlangfeld: temp01: Who'da thunk it?
13:20  temp01: inorite
13:21  carls: benlangfeld, mmmmm, so strange 'cause it shows me a blank beautytip. The same code works in firefox. Also it not works in Safari.
13:21  eponym: I think technically Chrome supports Microsoft S-Sheets Live, which is enough like CSS.
13:21  benlangfeld: carls: I have no idea what a beautytip is, but "it doesn't work" isn't going to get you any helpful responses
13:22  eponym: carls: try pasting some code on jsfiddle
13:23  carls: benlangfeld, if i change the property to display:block with firebug it shows correctly.
13:23  carls: benlangfeld, Beautytips provides ballon-help style tooltip
13:24  benlangfeld: carls: Property of what? No-one knows what you're talking about (or at least I don't)
13:24  eponym: benlangfeld: it's a jquery plugin I gather
13:25  eponym: carls: you're not so easy to understand. can you show us some code, using http://jsfiddle.net?
13:25  benlangfeld: eponym: I got that much, but as it stands all that's been said is "it doesn't work in Chrome" and something about setting something to display as a block
13:26  carls: benlangfeld, ok. I'm developing with drupal. I have some links that when i hover on it, shows information. To do this, i have a a div, with property "display:none", that it's showed on hover, inside the beautytip.
13:26  carls: Maybe now sounds more clear ;)
13:26  benlangfeld: carls: Ok, and what doesn't work and in what conditions?
13:26  eponym: carls: we need more context. show us something you're doing.
13:27 * eighty4 is doing something!
13:28  eponym: hooray!
13:28  carls: benlangfeld,  if i hover the link, the beautytip is empty. only if the property none is set. With block, shows ok.
13:28  benlangfeld: carls: Ok, and what do the plugin docs say?
13:28  eponym: carls: that just isn't enough information. do you have something to show?
13:28  carls: eponym, this -> http://www.lullabot.com/articles/announcing-beautytips-jquery-tooltip-plugin
13:29  benlangfeld: carls: While we're here, may I suggest this as a better option: http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html
13:29  eponym: carls: right, but that is the beautytips plugin page. what are *you* doing with it? how are you using it?

14:38  _kw: I'm making a simple connection checker (to see if a server is reachable), by doing an Ajax request to the server and responding to the success and error events..
14:38  _kw: Problem is, it always triggers the success handler, even when I've yanked out the inet cable :P
14:38  _kw: code is pretty straight forward, at http://paste.pocoo.org/show/309310/
14:39  _kw: I guess even the json packet I'm sending along is completely irrelevant, since it should fail long before that would even matter
14:40  _kw: there, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/309312/
14:40  _kw: 37 lines left in total :P
14:40  eponym: _kw: I'm taking a look, hang on.
14:41  _kw: thx a lot :)
14:42  eponym: _kw: I think error handles HTTP errors. Try returning a 404 and see if your error function fires then.
14:42  piklu: hello
14:43  _kw: eponym - what the server returns doesn't really matter I guess, since I'm testing it without internet access :)
14:44  _kw: hm, seems more people have run into this
14:44  eponym: _kw: woah, dude, that's *very* asynchronous.
14:45  _kw: what do you mean?
14:45  eponym: no internet access. :)
14:45  _kw: ah, hehe
14:45  eponym: I'm just saying, I think you need to receive an HTTP error, such as a 404, or a 408, for your error function to fire.
14:45  _kw: ok, but what would fire if I don't have internet access at all?
14:45  eponym: I'm not sure though.
14:46  _kw: also, it still seems odd that it'd still fire the 'success'
14:46  _kw: I'd think that if there's one thing it's not, it's a success :P
14:47  eponym: _kw: that's a good point!
14:47 --- seutje is now known as frigginSmoak
14:47  _kw: odd, isn't it
14:47  eponym: what happens if you console.log data or status  there?
14:48  _kw: data is null, status is "success"
14:49  eponym: _kw: try setting a timeout?
14:49  _kw: actually, I think data will only be null if there was no real connection
14:50  _kw: I might just be able to check that
14:50  eponym: _kw: But don't you want to know what's going on?! :)
14:50  _kw: haha
14:50  _kw: fair enough
14:50  _kw: although it seems to be a quirk that's been reported before
14:50  eponym: _kw: if you set a timeout: on your ajax call, does the error function fire then?
14:50  _kw: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-ajax-call-in-version-1-4-error-callback-not-called

14:52  _kw: still the same thing
14:52  _kw: success is triggered instantly in firefox

14:52  _kw: despite the complete and utter lack of internet ;P
14:53  eponym: Very odd, but interesting.
