00:09  philk_: is there a way to select elements $("DailyProgram:old(' + new Date().toCUFA() + ')') and if there are no such elements found, just return all DailyProgram elements?
00:10  philk_: currently I am doing this select first and then if nothing was selected I do another select $("DailyProgram")
00:10  temp01: philk_: select all dailyprogram elements then use filter and check length
00:10  philk_: maybe I should just get all and filter?
00:10  philk_: temp01: ahhh writing it gave me the same idea :)

00:25  negev: if i hide the submit button, ie8 won't submit when i press enter. is there a solution that doesn't involve catching the keyup event with javascript?
00:25  negev: a non-javascript solution would be ideal
00:25  Prometheus: cjm: not yet, but I'm thinking about it =)
00:25  temp01: i drink heavy coffee when scripting with jquery, does that count
00:28  cjm: yea it does temp01, I think im going to go that route to prometheus, want to hear about it from someone trying it

00:49  coldhead: in general
00:50  jedimind: thanks!
00:51  skrypets: how to load external page into jQuery UI Tabs widget , but not the whole page only some of tags ?
00:51  jedimind: coldhead, http://www.pud.ca/beta-v7/
00:51  jedimind: click around on the projects' thumbs
00:52  jedimind: some design still outstanding, but just wondering if that interaction is worth refining or if i should go somewhere more traditional (read: modal)
00:53  coldhead: i think that's pretty nice, jedimind
00:54  ajpiano: jedimind here's what i think
00:54  coldhead: modals are overused
00:54  ajpiano: i wish i could design as well as you :o
00:54  coldhead: especially when they give you the sense that you can't interact with the page until the modal fucks off
00:54  jedimind: ajpiano, i still have cleanup / implementation to do; so dont mock my code just yet :)
00:54  coldhead: jedimind: how do i go back to just the thumbs?
00:55  coldhead: find a way to make me not ask that question :)
00:55  jedimind: you dont just yet, eventually there'll be a X inside the popup
00:55  jedimind: now you can click on the currently selected thumb and it'll go away
00:55  jedimind: by virtue of the page refreshing :)
00:55  jedimind: im not done yet, the content areas will be significantly nicer visually
00:56  jedimind: so, overall, it works?
00:56  jedimind: any bugs / quirks that you guys can spot?
00:56  coldhead: just the closing thing
00:57  coldhead: and i didn't test in IE
00:57  coldhead: but it feels good
00:57  coldhead: FALCOM PUNNNCH NOOOO
00:57  jedimind: it's fine in IE, just no opacity yet
00:57  jedimind: though i thought .fade handled IE ?
00:58  jedimind: or fadeTo even
00:58  jedimind: works surprisingly well in IE now that you mention it :)
01:01  victorho: Hey guys, this is not directly jquery related but I am at my wits end. If you visit my website: http://www.awesomestartup.com/accounts/login/ you will see that the logo at the top left "resconnection" becomes very pixelated at certain levels of zoom

01:16  skrypets: i'll try thx
01:16  jamiros: @coldhead any ideas?
01:20  jamiros: found what was wrong
01:20  jamiros: I had inline as true
01:20  jamiros: but now my buttons don't show lol
01:22  coldhead: jamiros: do you need to make them display block or something?
01:22  coldhead: try messing with them in firebug
01:22  coldhead: or your regional equivalent
01:22  jamiros: yeah I've been doing that
01:22  jedimind: hrm do i have to have filter opacity set on an object in order for .fade(To) to work in IE ?
01:22  jamiros: I just put a ; in the inline true option and it displays the value
01:23  jamiros: but it seems jquery messesup
01:23  coldhead: sounds likely, jedimind
01:23  coldhead: can you paste the current state of things, jamiros?
01:23  coldhead: and say where to check?

01:27  jamiros: that's the result
01:27  jamiros: but there's a no show on the page
01:28  jamiros: the format is somehow stopping it from showing
01:28  coldhead: and when you inspect the html with firebug?
01:28  coldhead: is there anything there?
01:28  jamiros: where?
01:28  jamiros: in the result?
01:28  coldhead: #datapicker

01:32  taitems: hmm, i've still got this issue where a jquery ui dialog with an iframe inside of it is growing by 5px every time i drag it in by its titlebar in IE
01:32  taitems: i tried setting up a similar scenario in JSbin, but couldn't get it to replicate
01:32  coldhead: jamiros: http://jsfiddle.net/MBRnj/
01:32  coldhead: is that what you're seeing?
01:32  coldhead: except better styled, obv.

01:34  jamiros: yes
01:34  jamiros: exactly what I'm seeing
01:34  jamiros: no values in the texbox areas
01:34  coldhead: oh right
01:35  coldhead: you want the value="" to still be there
01:35  jamiros: yes
01:35  coldhead: that should be possible!
01:35  jamiros: I'm editing a parent's DOB and info that I get from mysql
01:35  jamiros: but the darn value doesn't show
01:36  jamiros: eventhough it's there
01:37  jamiros: see if I remove the dateformat option it does show
01:38  jamiros: but when I choose another date the format is default (obvious)
01:39  Third3ye: Hey there, I'm writing an ajax form and I was wondering if there was a better way of doing this: data: {email : $('input["mail"]').val(), stance : $('input["mail"]').val()},
01:40  jamiros: I'm gonna try to set regionalization maybe that will work
01:40  taitems: Third3ye: i believe you can specify a form and serialize all the values
01:41  jamiros: I can test in jsfiddle =D thanks for the page @coldhead
01:41  Third3ye: Alright... how do I use serialized data in $.ajax? Just... leave data to it's standard value?
01:42  Third3ye: eh, taitems?
01:43  taitems: Third3ye: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
01:44  coldhead: ajpiano: do you know how to have datepicker keep its original value in the input text?
01:45  Third3ye: That has told me nothing at this point, taitems :/
01:45  Third3ye: I'm still stuck wondering why a function in my script which used to work doesn't work anymore...
01:46  taitems: Third3ye: i just saw your question asking if there was a better way to send the data along with an ajax request, other than manually specifying all of them - so thats why i suggested serializing all the form values
01:47  taitems: i haven't really dabbled with it either
01:47  d4ft: hey guys quick question -  I'm making an ajax call which returns a div with images.  I'd like to call function once those images load.  I'm trying to something with .resize, but im not exactly sure how to get it to fire correctly.  Any thoughts?
01:48  Third3ye: oo syntax error >.<;; nvm, taitems ^^;; wasn't the ajax values
01:50  coldhead: jamiros: http://jsfiddle.net/MBRnj/2/
01:50  icek: hi, im trying to run this demo on my server for learning purposes, i copied it exactly but it renders differently then the demo url... what the heck is going on?  very minor difference, look at the down arrow on the accordion Section headers that and the accordion itself looks slightly different:  demo:  http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/jquery-ui.html  my url http://hathol.com/test/test.php
01:50  coldhead: you can probably do all that in single calls to datepicker but it seems to work

02:52  Hoe``: is there a way to remove a property set via .css?
02:54  josephsaliba: Hoe what do u want to remove?
02:54  Hoe``: a background-color
02:55  josephsaliba: u want to put it white? transparent? ...
02:55  Hoe``: I don't think setting it to inherit will do the trick, as there's specific css selectors it should fall back to
02:56  Hoe``: I need a specific place to override the color of a jquery ui-dialog, so in dialogclose i need it to revert it
02:57  josephsaliba: u can change the color by $("#urElement").css("background-color","...");
02:57  Hoe``: ya, but i need it to fall back to the old css selectors, not to a specific color, so that the themes kick back in
02:57  josephsaliba: if u want to remove i guess u want it to appear as transparent
02:59  Phrogz_: Hoe``: In standard DOM you would set backgroundColor to ""; presumably the same will work with jQuery?

03:08  Joikus_: is there a way to accomplish via js
03:08  Joikus_: i tried something like this on the page in question,  $("#createMessage").each(function () { var popup = jQuery(this); popup.parent().appendTo(jQuery("form:first")); });
03:08  Joikus_: no luck
03:09  Hoe``: joikus: you can do .get/.post with .serialize
03:09  Hoe``: well, maybe that wont work if you call .serialize on a !form
03:10  Joikus_: no I need to write my <form> tag outside of the original <form> which I cannot touch
03:10  Joikus_: hmm
03:13  Joikus_: problem is, jquery ui dialog dumps the popup outside of my <form>

03:50  ajoslin103: good [local] evening everybody, I am seeking advice on which build tool to use.  I work primarily with javascript, html/css & php.  I am hoping to be able to automate delivery of minified javascript and/or streamlined css.  I use git for my scmTool, but would switch if needed.  thoughts?

03:52  tolborg: ill try it :D
03:52  tolborg: thanks
03:53  tolborg: i would have loved to use the placeholder attr though
03:53  felixjet: you can
03:54  felixjet: just replace .val()

04:40  rhizmoe: how can i do something like $('input#foo'){ var foo = contents_of_#foo }
04:40  rhizmoe: ?
04:40  rhizmoe: one of the elusive secrets of javascript for me: where the stuff is.
04:40  mac9416: JS and jQuery noob here. I'm getting the error "c.easing[this.options.specialEasing && this.options.specialEasing[this.prop] || a] is not a function" in Firebug. Any idears?
04:41  rhizmoe: looks like you're not including your fancy easing junk
04:41  rhizmoe: or whatever listens for it
04:42  mac9416: Not including fancy easing junk. Check. So, I'm using Wordpress and this line to include what I donwloaded from jqueryui.com: "<?php wp_enqueue_script('jQuery', get_bloginfo("stylesheet_directory") . '/jquery-ui/js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js'); ?>"
04:42  mac9416: I think this wouldn't be as complicated if I stopped trying to be nice to Worpdress.
04:43  rhizmoe: maybe you dl'ed a funky jquery package? it gets a little confusing sometimes.
04:43  mac9416: This URL: http://jqueryui.com/download/jquery-ui-1.8.6.custom.zip
04:43  rhizmoe: which is to say, is this default jq functionality?
04:44  rhizmoe: yeah, custom is subject to all the checkboxes and stuff. everybody gets "...custom.zip" if you don't get everything
04:44  mac9416: Um... Not sure. I'm trying to achieve the "blind" effect.
04:44  mac9416: I hit the "stable" link on jqueryui.com.
04:46  rhizmoe: yeah, don't click anything else, download it, and worry about easing until after you have the blind working
04:47  mac9416: Well, I had no idea I was using any easing stuff. My script just uses whatever.hide("blind"...
04:47  mac9416: Nothing fancy I don't think.
04:47  mac9416: Maybe I should include jquery-ui-1.8.6.custom.min.js.
04:47  rhizmoe: ah
04:48  rhizmoe: well, whatever the file you have is named, you should put that
04:49  mac9416: I just included both files. Seems to have done the job. Maybe not how WP would like me to do it, but it works. Thanks, rhizmoe.
04:50  rhizmoe: WP DON'T KNOW NOTHIN
04:50  mac9416: Hehe, you're right.
04:50  rhizmoe: can i just stick a gsub in a method chain to prevent e.g. ajax requests for postcodes less than 5 digits long?
04:51  Phrogz: rhizmoe: I think you mean .replace; this isn't #ruby :)
04:51  rhizmoe: hm, i thought js was the same. where else? php?
04:57  dibs: should .live('submit' be working in 1.4+??
04:58  rhizmoe: actuall .match (or something like it ;)
04:59  rhizmoe: so, as far as the "dropping in the method chain" business goes, is this ok?

05:31  danheberden: David - can i touch jquery? if so, is it ticklish?
05:31  danheberden: and more importantly, will it touch me back?
05:32 @coldhead: atan: ogg is very good for speech
05:32  danheberden: and animal sounds
05:32 @coldhead: you usually just need to specify the quality
05:33  atan: I just want to figure out what I will tell my recorder. To I just tell them record OGG using Vorbis, or do I need something else in there.
05:33 @coldhead: ask for the file in ogg vorbis format
05:33 @coldhead: i think that's the parlance
05:33  danheberden: and if they ask for quality/bitrate say "as high as the slider goes"
05:33  atan: coldhead, is there a bitrate I should be including in that phrase?
05:34  atan: danheberden, won't that result in an overly large file? :P
05:34 @coldhead: atan: just the quality
05:34  danheberden: sure ;)
05:34 @coldhead: i'mn trying to find you the table
05:34  atan: http://nigelcoldwell.co.uk/audio/ ?
05:35 @coldhead: atan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis#Technical_details
05:35 @coldhead: at right it gives the bitrates
05:35  danheberden: 96+ would more than suitable for just voice
05:36 @coldhead: more than
05:36  atan: danheberden, think of this as an audio book =)
05:36  danheberden: exactly
05:36  atan: Except it's important that it is very clear, and the listener is able to hear everything very clearly
05:36  danheberden: you're only using like 400hz range
05:36  atan: So 96kbps or up?
05:37  danheberden: coldhead - you think a vbr would add a bunch to the filesilze ?
05:37  atan: And I suppose this audio format will output a .oga file for just audio?
05:37 @coldhead: i think using the quality setting automatically does VBR
05:37 @coldhead: .ogg, atan
05:37 @coldhead: you should do some test encodings yourself
05:37 @coldhead: or look some up
05:37 @coldhead: to find a good setting
05:38  danheberden: i'd be curious what the filesize difference would be on such a limited bandwith recording
05:38 @coldhead: it would depend on the source
05:39  Third3ye: Trying to make an "if else" statement where if the input box is empty the script will display an error message so if ($(this).is(:empty)).. or if ($('input').is(":empty"))?
05:41  danheberden: Third3ye: keep in mind :empty is for childnodes
05:42  Third3ye: hmm
05:42  danheberden: i assume you want to check the value property of that input
05:42  Third3ye: Yeah, not it's children ^^;;
05:42  danheberden: if( this.value =="" ) { /* display crazy awesome error message /* }
05:42  danheberden: or $(this).val()
05:43  danheberden: but this.value will work crossbrowser just fine
05:43  danheberden: (if it's a typical input
05:43  danheberden: if you're working with selects 'n shit, then $(this).val(0
05:43  danheberden: *)
05:43  danheberden: silly closing parens

05:48  Third3ye: Now here's a question...

05:49  Third3ye: But I'm going to make a filter for e-mail input..
05:50 @coldhead: ?eval 'yes'.match(/y.s$/)

06:01  Third3ye: Why wouldn't that work? :/
06:02 @coldhead: are you trying to match email addresses?
06:02  Third3ye: Yepp
06:02 @coldhead: that wheel has been thoroughly invented already
06:02  Third3ye: and no, I don't want to use jquery.validate.js :P
06:03  Third3ye: unless you had something else in mind, coldhead ^^;;
06:04  Third3ye: I wanna slimline all source code and feel that at this point the functionality of jquery.validate.js is overkill
06:04  Third3ye: the PHP does most of the validation anyways
06:06 @coldhead: there are lots of other javascript email address matchers
06:07  Third3ye: Like...? ^^;; I'm.. not that well versed in JS
06:09  haq: Third3ye, probably check google.. you're looking for a regular expression for a valid email to plug in
06:09  Third3ye: Ah k...
06:09  haq: a lot of them are available
06:09  haq: just plug it in between match()
06:09  Third3ye: Thought js was able to parse regex :/

06:09  haq: put your regex expression in between match()
06:10  haq: match will return the value though, i believe, not true or false

06:42 --- rchern-afk is now known as rchern
06:42  danheberden: da-beginner: and not using jquery to create it?
06:42  danheberden: cuz jquery is badzors?
06:43  danheberden: and there aren't value elements
06:43  danheberden: but there are input elements
06:43  danheberden: that have a value attribute
06:43 @coldhead: var ele = $('#maker').val(); $(ele).appendTo('body')
06:44  danheberden: $('<input />', { value: 'whatwhat' }).appendTo('body');
06:44  danheberden: boom
06:45  icek: If I have <div class="window" id="window1">Device List</div>   and i simply want to hide it using javascript, how would I hide all elements contained in the div class "window" ?

06:46 --- perlite_ is now known as perlite
06:46  icek: ?
06:47  danheberden: um.... $('#window1').hide()?
06:48  danheberden: or you trollin', with that getElementsByTagName shit
06:49  da-beginner: danherberden: i have x.createElement(input)
06:49  icek: not trolling danheberden, how do i hide all within the window class not just window1
06:49  da-beginner: then i want to add the 'value' attribute using the same kind of syntax
06:50  danheberden: icek - but if you hide window
06:50  da-beginner: thanks danheberden
06:50  icek: ?
06:50  danheberden: all the others will be hiddeen
06:50  danheberden: its like, if i blow up your house
06:50  danheberden: your windows will be blown up too
06:51  danheberden: even though i didn't explicitely blow up your windows
06:51  icek: huh, but i just want to hide all things contained in class window
06:52  Cork: icek: $('.window').hide(); ?
06:53  Cork: or do you want to explisitly hide the children?
06:53  danheberden: $('.window').children().hide()
06:53 --- hi is now known as Guest54765
06:53  danheberden: $('.window *').hide()
06:54  icek: is there an easy way to hide all elements within a javascript canvas?
06:54  danheberden: omg
06:54  danheberden: just hide the canvas
06:54  Guest54765: so I'm trying to create a search engine for my site but something weird is happening. just curious, when you have .keydown(function{whatever()}) does it run whatever a ton of times or just once when you press a key
06:55  Cork: icek: jquery is built to handle dom elements, there is no dom elements in a canvas
06:55  Guest54765: and if so, how can I run something only once when a key is pressed?
06:55  icek: Cork, how do i hide all elements within the canvas?
06:55  Cork: Guest15399: it runs on interval as long as the key is down, if i remember correctly
06:56  Cork: icek: you would have to ex. create an image of whats in the canvas and clear it
06:56  Cork: icek: but ya, by far the simplest way is to hide the canvas
06:56  icek: canvas.hide();
06:56  icek: ?
06:57  Cork: if canvas is a jquery object, ya
06:57  Guest54765: ok, that makes sense, how do I make it run only once per new input value, like if(value = 1) {run function}  is that how you would make it run only once?
06:57  Cork: Guest15399: trigger on keyup?
06:58  Cork: or keypress
06:58  Guest54765: keydown
06:58  Guest54765: what should I use?
06:58  icek: It is not, $(document.getElementById("canvas")).hide();   ?
06:58  danheberden: keydown is once
06:58  danheberden: keypress is repeated
06:59 @coldhead: guys, programming isn't easy
06:59  Guest54765: SWEET
06:59  Guest54765: thanks man
06:59  Cork: keyup only triggers once per keypress, that is no repeat what so ever even if you hold it down to get more characters, keypress triggers each time a new character is added

07:10  Guest54765: I got my search engine working great now, so thank you, but its really slow because it runs on every result, is I tried setTimeout but it seems to then run every 500 after the first time, how would you suggest adding time each keypress so it waits before doing the function associated with it?
07:10  danheberden: and a gentle lover
07:10  FWOAR: Say, any ideas why .load() would be firing twice?
07:10  kindlebit: danheberden:ok,i am new to this chatzilla

07:10  danheberden: coldhead has one
07:10  danheberden: and i don't mean a rug
07:10  FWOAR: and the hot arabic chick
07:11  danheberden: Guest54765: the timeout will sitll fire
07:11  danheberden: you need to log the time and check it
07:11  kindlebit: danheberden:ok,i use simple javascript for ajax and i want to use jquery now
07:11  danheberden: like a var higher in scope = new Date().getTime(); then in the request make sure it's been more than like a second or whateve
07:12  danheberden: kindlebit: well get ready for some simpler javascript
07:12  Guest54765: sweet, I'll look up those functions so I know how to use them

07:22  muley: so why does $('form').serialize() work, but $('div').serialize(); doesnt? .... you have to do $('div').find(':input').serialize(); ... seems redundant, no?
07:22  icek: if i have a list <ul id="list1">  is there an easy way to make the elements within the list draggable but not the entire list itself? $( "#list1" ).draggable(); makes the whole list draggable
07:23  Guest54765: got it Cork
07:24  Cork: Guest54765: thats in msec though not sec
07:24  Guest54765: i'll keep that in mind
07:24  muley: icek: you probably want to do $("#list li").draggable() instead? make the li's draggable instead of the entire ul?
07:24  temp01: muley: form.serialize() is a common operation and makes sense. div.serialize() is not a common operation and the user might expect it to get serialized differently than how serialize() serializes (i.e. just form elements)
07:25 --- onre is now known as Guest42384
07:25  temp01: so being explicit in that case avoids any surprizes

07:25  muley: lol
07:25  wookiehangover: unicorns
07:26  temp01: people might expect it to serialize the whole element
07:26  muley: true that is php behavior for serializing objects...
07:26 @coldhead: no $('elem').toString() does that
07:26  temp01: no u
07:26  muley: but the current behavior does nothing
07:26  muley: better to win some than lose all =]
07:29  muley: still have nothing but <333 for jquery
07:31  hamed: hi
07:31  icek: lol muley, thanks, i am working with a list inside of an accordion, i want it to drag out of the accordion and then snap back when i let go, are there any plugins for something like that?
07:32  icek: in otherwords, does anyone know of an accordion type plugin or something that lets me drag the elements of the accordion out and have them snap back in when i let go?
07:32  muley: icek: sortables? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
07:32  icek: o maybe that'd work mulet
07:32  icek: muley
07:33  muley: i think the accordion functionality supersedes the drag/drop
07:33  muley: should be ok
07:36 @coldhead: you're playing with firse

07:37  icek: muley, im trying to drag the item out of its own div class and into another for drop detection, but when i drag it tries to expand that area with a scroll bar and doesnt let me move it over
07:38 @coldhead: i think bob turned out to be laura palmer's father

09:15  atan2: I clicked a # link, then another, and the second link still worked
09:15  atan2: But perhaps I am applying this wrong
09:15  Cork: atan2: that will applay to all a elements
09:15  Cork: *apply
09:15  atan2: http://pastie.org/1301967 is what I am using
09:16  Cork: atan2: but it won't prevent js events bound to the element
09:16  atan2: Cork, I clicked my control link (a href=#) and then another right after it, and the second link still worked fine
09:16  Cork: only the default action
09:16  atan2: The PDF link aside, I wasn't using that one
09:17  Cork: atan2: do something like $self.data('block-click', true); (and unset it in the setTimeout)
09:17  Cork: atan2: then check if its set in the other events
09:17  Cork: and bail out ifit is

09:25  Gelegrod1n: atan2: $(this) refers too setTimeout ?

09:43  trollboy: anyone ever have issues nesting a accordian within a dialog?  the accordian isn't expanding for some reason.  There's no error being thrown however.  I can post the url if you'd like
09:44  denniscollective: if I have an object, how would I get each key of an object? i.e. {language: "javascript", level: "aprentice"} and return "language" and "level"?
09:44  Jarda: trollboy: could it be that the z-index of dialog is bigger than the one from accordion so the accordien isn't receiving click events?
09:44  Jarda: denniscollective: $.each(myObjec, function(key, value) { });
09:44  trollboy: the little indicator triangle indicates it *should* be expanded Jarda
09:45  Jarda: trollboy: oh, right. Then I don't know. Check with firebug :)
09:45  StevenTyler: trollboy, post the URL
09:45  denniscollective: thanks Jarda

09:50  JKarsrud: atan2: Any luck so far?
09:50  atan2: JKarsrud, no =(
09:50  atan2: Closest I got was moving it outside to an external function
09:50  JKarsrud: mock up a demo on jsfiddle and I'll help you out :)
09:50  atan2: But I can't get that to run it
09:53  atan2: http://jsfiddle.net/MghEg/1/
09:53  atan2: I've never used jsfiddle before hope that's correct
09:56  doonie: why would you create a function within an event ;\
09:56  atan2: doonie, I can't seem to run the code inside setTimeout()
09:56  doonie: because it does not know what this is
09:57  atan2: It doesn't even error out though?
09:57  atan2: nothing was in console =\
09:57  doonie: cause it just doesn't find it
09:57  doonie: function() { $this.html('after'); }
09:57  doonie: http://jsfiddle.net/MghEg/2/
09:58  doonie: it doesn't show an error cause there is none, the code just doesn't work ;>

09:59 * atan2 gives doonie a great big hug
09:59  atan2: and you to, JKarsrud =D
10:01  atan2: Now the only thing that's slightly crappy is the animated GIF freezes up
10:01  JKarsrud: Ooh, was kindof bizi, sorry :) But doonie figured it out :)
10:01  atan2: But in the end, it does replace it back with the other image so it's hard to notice
10:01  atan2: I think the GIF thing is a browser issue though
10:01  atan2: I suspect the browsers stops all animations when a new page/link is clicked or requested
10:01  JKarsrud: Probably is, try preloading it :)
10:02  atan2: I suppose there's a simple jquery function for that?
10:02  JKarsrud: ?g "jquery preload"
10:02  bot-t: JKarsrud, jQuery.Preload - Ariel Flesler - http://flesler.blogspot.com/search/label/jQuery.Preload
10:02  doonie: don't use javascript:; that stops
10:02  doonie: and some other stuff
10:03  atan2: Can you escape javascript? setTimeout("$this.html('<img src=\"/assets/images/file_pdf.png\" width=24 height=24 />');",
10:04  Cork: atan2: don't use strings for setTimeout and you don't need to
10:04  Cork: use setTimeout(function() {}) instead of setTimeout("")
10:05  atan2: ty =D
10:05  Cork: atan2: its much faster in new browsers, so its better for many reasons

10:28  finfin82: no idea ;-) sorry
10:29  JKarsrud: have you included jquery? :)

10:37  krz: slide up and click
10:37  krz: delay slide up and fadeout on click
10:37  Cork: krz: thats one event and one function call, not two events
10:38  krz: how should it be written then?
10:38  Cork: krz: you want it to fadeout and slideup at the same time?
10:38  krz: no. i want it to fade out after 5 seconds period
10:38  krz: err
10:38  Cork: and what is slideup meant to do?
10:38  krz: no. i want it to slideup after 5 seconds period
10:39  krz: is what i meant to say ^^
10:39  krz: i also want a click event
10:39  talented: http://codepad.org/5qRVvDWk
10:39  Cork: ok, so: on create it should show for 5 seconds then slideup, nad when you click it it should fade?
10:39  krz: whats so difficult to understand?
10:40  Cork: krz: your not specifying what should happen when
10:40  Cork: your talking about events that isn't there
10:40  krz: it slides up in 5 seconds. if the user clicks on it before 5 seconds it should fade out
10:40  Cork: ok
10:40  krz: it seems that the delay method is preventing the click event
10:40  Cork: you need to go the delay, slideup call after each time you add a new element
10:41  talented: a timed event and if click, stop the timed event and instead fade out
10:41  Cork: hmm, i don't think the delay queue should block events, but i'm not sure about that
10:42  Cork: but ya, if thats really the case use setTimeout instead
10:43  krz: Cork: it seems like its blocking it
10:43  krz: if i remove lines 5-7, the click event works
10:44  Cork: krz: ok then use setTimeout(function() { $notification.slideup('slow'); }); instead
10:46  krz: well how does setTimeout(function() { $notification.slideup('slow'); }); set a timer?
10:46  krz: where do i specify the seconds?
10:46  Cork: opps forgot the last argument :)
10:46  Cork: its msec after ); }

11:01  talented: yea... without indicies/indexes
11:02  JKarsrud: talented: But why, really?
11:02  NET||abuse: The error is the $ is not defined in the jsonp plugin.
11:04  Cork: talented: what is it you want then, the last? first? or what?
11:04  talented: because I'm at like the 4th child of it... and I go to the parent but need to be able to get to the 2nd child... basically the it's just every 2nd child of each td element needs special attention
11:04  Cork: eq(1) is always the second in the talbe
11:04  talented: yea... but I need to cater for change if it alters
11:05  JKarsrud: talented: Don't overcomplicate things if it doesn't have to be
11:05  JKarsrud: What you could do, is apply a class to that td
11:05  Cork: the only other thing i can think of is .next().next()
11:05  talented: would next() next() get that element?
11:06  talented: hmm... at the parent that would get the next sibling which would be another tr
11:06  Cork: if you have the first child it will get you the third, and if you have the sencond it gives you the forth and so on

11:08  JKarsrud: ElGoorf: What version of jquery are you using?
11:09  JKarsrud: if it's hidden, and you're using < 1.4.4, it will return 0 I think
11:09  ElGoorf: thats a good point i am using an old version
11:09  JKarsrud: I believe they fixed that in 1.4.4
11:09  ElGoorf: yes thats the excact issue
11:09  JKarsrud: Upgrade time! YAY! :D
11:09  JKarsrud: Probably won't break anything
11:09  JKarsrud: Unless you're checking if the height or width is 0 somewhere because the element is hidden, but I guess that's not an issue for you yet ;)
11:11  ElGoorf: aww that didnt fix it :(
11:12  JKarsrud: code plz lolz
11:12  JKarsrud: :)
11:12  ElGoorf: i'd love to show you, but its massive, unless you've got lots of free tiem i'd rather not hastle anyone

11:13  JKarsrud: ElGoorf: Minify it to an example? :)
11:13  ElGoorf: i'll try
11:13  ElGoorf: i'll show you the page

11:14  StevenTyler: in a real fight who would win? jquery or ruby on rails?
11:15  ElGoorf: i have a jsfiddle inbound
11:15  JKarsrud: ElGoorf: it alerts the height here
11:15  ElGoorf: yeh it should do
11:15  ElGoorf: but its the wrong height :P
11:15  JKarsrud: orly?
11:15  JKarsrud: which height should it be?
11:17  tom2strobl: hi guys I'm missing something and just cant figure out what it is. Everything works perfectly, but whenever #addnewsbutton is clicked it fires two times. http://pastie.org/1302144
11:17  ElGoorf: what happens is it does an ajax request for the next page, and then loads it into a div on an adjacent hidden panel
11:17  JKarsrud: StevenTyler: I do believe you have your definitions mixed up. rails is a framework for RUBY, jquery is a framework for JAVASCRIPT.
11:17  ElGoorf: which then slides in
11:18  ElGoorf: its the height of the new generated panel that's coming with the wrong value
11:19  ElGoorf: and because it relies on an ajax request i cant rly show you working code XD

11:20  JKarsrud: Hmm, what if you load in the content, but put visibility hidden on it, so that it takes up the proper height, and then show it
11:21  ElGoorf: holy crap
11:21  ElGoorf: i just spotted a typo
11:21  ElGoorf: a rly significant one XD
11:21  JKarsrud: okay=
11:21  JKarsrud: ?
11:21  ElGoorf: shit me
11:21  ElGoorf: it was all down to a missing "
11:21  ElGoorf: its fixed XD
11:21 * ElGoorf has a party and then slaps himself for wasting so many hours
11:22  JKarsrud: nice :)
11:22  JKarsrud: Next time, use a proper editor :P
11:22  JKarsrud: ;)
11:22  ElGoorf: missed the " so it wasnt even applying the class
11:22  JKarsrud: Aha
11:22  ElGoorf: im using netbeans :(
11:22  JKarsrud: Sucks
11:22  ElGoorf: but because its in a string
11:22  JKarsrud: webstorm! :d
11:22  ElGoorf:  $('.panel').after('<div class="panel"><div class="panel-wrapper">'+data.contents+'</div></div>');
11:22  JKarsrud: Ahh, it's inside a string
11:22  ElGoorf: at the end of panel-wrapper
11:22  JKarsrud: I see
11:22  JKarsrud: Makes sense, then
11:22  JKarsrud: But still, should use a proper editor
11:23  JKarsrud: Mine injects html/xml if it's built like that
11:23  ElGoorf: well im always open to new ideas
11:24  ElGoorf: and netbeans is a resource hog
11:24 * ElGoorf downloads this.. "webstorm"

11:25  JKarsrud: Yeah, but you get update messages when new builds are out

11:35  MikeH: Hi guys
11:36  MikeH: is there a way to get the whole response from a getJSON request?
11:36  MikeH: similar to xhr.responseText?
11:37 @coldhead: MikeH: if you could just access the xhr, would that be okay?
11:37  MikeH: well yes, then I could just use responseText then :P

11:38  MikeH: Thanks

11:38  NET||abuse: so here's a good question if anyone's got time to look at my 3rd party site widget embed bootstrap code? http://pastebin.com/Rvtg8eBa
11:39  NET||abuse: the error i get is the $ isn't defined in the jsonp plugin,
11:39  NET||abuse: this is because my JQuery instnace is hidden inside the scope of the anonymous function.
11:39 @coldhead: MikeH: i'm glad you asked here, i didn't know about .responseText
11:39  NET||abuse: so the plugin isn't picking it up, i need a way to connect the plugin just to my instance of jquery.
11:40  MikeH: coldhead, the first time I used "ajax" (I know) I used native XHR object and .split()
11:41  MikeH: that is the only reason I know :P
11:41 @coldhead: you're a real man, MikeH, i never did ajax without cosy comfy safe jquery
11:46  NET||abuse: anyone? :) http://pastebin.com/Rvtg8eBa  solve the plugin conundrum here?
11:46  Fichte: how can i send my file input via $(this).serialize()?
11:47  Fichte: the file seems not to be sent by my $.post($(this).attr(action), $(this).serialize(), function(data){callback();})

12:07  ablomen: NET||abuse, for one, line 15 should be mainapp().init($);, since mainapp is a function that returns an object
12:08  ablomen: also, what is $LAB?

12:21  denysonique: there is
12:21  cha0s_: ty
12:23  denysonique: cha0s_, and if you don't know the dimensions there is array.length
12:26  oggu: How can i view what events are binded to an element?
12:30  NET||abuse: ablomen, i don't need to run mainapp() as at the end of the definition of mainapp, i run it  with   }();
12:30  NET||abuse: ablomen, so it's already callable.
12:30  NET||abuse: ablomen, although, you've just given me a little idea.
12:30  NET||abuse: still, i'm not able to get jsonp to pick up jquery in this way.
12:32  ablomen: NET||abuse, ah yes missed that
12:33  NET||abuse: ablomen, have any idea s to why i'm having the troubles i'm having? :)
12:33  NET||abuse: or rather as to how i can get jsonp to pick up jquery her?
12:33  ablomen: NET||abuse, ehm does the plugin for any chance extend $?
12:33  ablomen: s/for/by
12:34  NET||abuse: ablomen, it's the standard jquery.jsonp2.1.3  http://jquery-jsonp.googlecode.com/files/jquery.jsonp-2.1.3.js
12:36  NET||abuse: ablomen, so it's constructed using ( function( $ , setTimeout ) { ..../stuff }(JQuery, setTimeout)
12:36  ablomen: NET||abuse, i have no idea, with all the noclonflicts and script loading going on i can't debug just in my head
12:36  NET||abuse: yeh, ok
12:36  NET||abuse: ablomen, that's the simplified version :)
12:37  Birliban: Hi, i user datatables plugin and i have one hidden column with an id in it. how to access this id? if i do it the usual way with jquery selectors i cant get it. in firebug i do not see the column too...
12:39  ablomen: NET||abuse, btw i would also look out with defining the functions after you run the $LAB part, it does not seem a very safe bet that the callback of loading jquery runs after the functions are defined (cached content etc)
12:40  NET||abuse: ablomen, how do you mean?
12:41  oggu: jquery data
12:41  ablomen: oh btw
12:41  NET||abuse: ablomen, are you saying the callback the runs jqloadplugins() would be risky?

12:43  NET||abuse: yes it would undefine $, but it returns a jquery instance. no? which i assign to the locally scoped JQuery.
12:43  ablomen: so the plugin could not extend it since it is in variable that is called JQuery, and
12:44  ablomen: which is only available in that scope
12:44 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 91 seconds
12:44  ablomen: while the plugin wants jQuery in a global var
12:44  NET||abuse: yes this is true, and done on purpose,
12:44  NET||abuse: the reason is to run jquery without inflicting any conflicts with another copy of jquery
12:45  NET||abuse: this call would affect the jquery that the site was already using?
12:46  Lumpio-: ...why would you use two instances of jQuery at the same tmie
12:46  Lumpio-: That is silly
12:46  NET||abuse: I wouldn't
12:46  NET||abuse: this is to be dropped into 3rd party sites, that may or maynot use jquery already

12:48  styol: if i would like to bind a click to a div of a certain type, how could i pass hidden text related to / in the div, to the click function? i had a <span style="display:none;">hidden stuff</span> but it seems like there must be a better way
12:48  NET||abuse: styol, wuh?
12:49  NET||abuse: styol, explain a little clearer?
12:49  harshamv: how to create a button which on click goes to a url like delete/{id} and then once the php logic returns true comes back and posts a message delted
12:49  NET||abuse: harshamv, ajax
12:50  talented: styol, you could use .data() on that element
12:50  styol: sorry, basically im trying to execute some jquery when something is clicked and grab a hidden string from the item being clicked that is then used in the click function.
12:50  ablomen: NET||abuse, yes but if the plugin tries to extend jQuery
12:50  ablomen: ..
12:51  gambo: hi
12:51  gambo: can anybody tell my why jQuery.ajaxComplete(); doesn't exist?
12:51  ablomen: even if it did know about the JQuery variable it has no way to access it since its in a different scope
12:51  gambo: http://jsfiddle.net/5epYC/2/
12:51  NET||abuse: ablomen, so there must be someway to container up the plugins and have them only apply locally to the scoped JQuery
12:52  ablomen: NET||abuse, well define JQuery as window.JQuery and edit the plugin
12:53  NET||abuse: ablomen, well, the main jquery that would be on the site already would be window.JQuery   so i'd need to define window.myjqquery or something?
12:53  gambo: I have a Site where I want to listen to ajaxCompleteEvents. I don't want to change code of another developer who used jQuery.ajax();
12:53  styol: talented: i guess more like is there an attribute i can piggy back to pass a string like <div text="hidden text jquery pulls">
12:53  ablomen: NET||abuse, no that would be window.jQuery
12:53  ablomen: jQuery !== JQuery
12:54  NET||abuse: ablomen, ohhh? sorry, didn't notice case
12:54  styol: i know i can retrieve an attribute with attr() but curious if there is a valid attribute that i could use for this i suppose
12:54  talented: styol, class
12:54  ablomen: anyway, myjQuery or something would be a better name since this is confusing enough already
12:54  gambo: http://jsfiddle.net/5epYC/3/
12:55  styol: talented: use a class to pass "a random text string that will be outputted to the user" hmm.. that would make hooking these items harder tho cause id need to use ID's to hook
12:55  NET||abuse: styol, attach the click event by class  so <a class="deleteme" href="/path/id">delete</a> then use the id from the href in the click handler for $('a.deleteme').click(function(){//stuff});
12:56  styol: <a class="willshowmessage" href="javascript:void(0);" text="something to read in with jquery via attr()">this will render an overlay of sorts</a>
12:56  gambo: solved
12:56  JKarsrud: styol: Use html5 data attributes
12:56  gambo: jQuery(window) works
12:56  JKarsrud: Or use jquery data()
12:56  talented: styol, probably .data() is the best option then
12:57  talented: store it on the element, retrieve it when clicked
12:57  styol: hmm i guess i dont get how to use data() for this, will check it out more.. i just didnt want to use a random attribute that will fail validation but i guess thats what html5 data attributes would be for or am i confused?
12:57  JKarsrud: you are correct
12:58  styol: there is nothing i could use that is valid without defining html5 data attributes?
12:58  styol: cause im ok with a span inside that is hidden and read out hehe
12:58  JKarsrud: then a hidden input would be better imo
12:58  styol: good call, thanks
12:58  JKarsrud: as it's that elements job to actually hold hidden data :P
12:59  harshamv: NET||abuse: is there a tut for ajax?

13:12  Fabian_: this only makes the first element draggable
13:12  kelye: Fabian_: full example needed :)
13:12  kelye: html and all
13:12  Fabian_: while $('.droppable_container').css('display', 'none')
13:12  kelye: pastebin somewhere
13:13  Fabian_: disables all
13:13  JKarsrud: Fabian_: Either make an example, or try to loop each element inside the list to set them to draggable

13:15  TF22Raptor: hi guys just wondering if someone could show me what I am doing wrong with this super basic script. On rollover of an image, I am trying to change the image of a completley different image (not the rollover, it has a class of midimage) http://pastie.org/private/rrsgoplxgb5roludnm9aq any help would be great
13:16  Fabian_: is each able to do such things??
13:16  JKarsrud: TF22Raptor: Why do you have three functions inside your hover?
13:17  JKarsrud: Fabian_: $('.droppable_container').each(function() { $(this).draggable(); }); might work, I don
13:17  JKarsrud: don't know for certain
13:17  Fabian_: thanks ill try
13:17  TF22Raptor: JKarsrud, first line if for hover state, 2nd line is for off state (these 2 work fine), 3rd line is the line I am trying to change the completely different image.
13:17  JKarsrud: But hover can't take more that two functions
13:17  pashmi: has anybody know, javascript bookmark this page button is supported in Safari and Chrome or not?
13:18  JKarsrud: first is mouseenter, second is mouseleave
13:18  TF22Raptor: JKarsrud cant I simply extend that and have it also do something else?
13:18  JKarsrud: You need to do the switching inside one of them, not in a third function
13:18  JKarsrud: nope
13:19  JKarsrud: But I can't see why you can't do the switching inside the mouseleave?
13:19  TF22Raptor: JKarsud sorry I'm not all that good with javascript, can you show me how you would set that argument up?
13:20  sveajobb: hi guys. I'm having some trouble with mangeAjax..

I do the following.  .manageAjax.add('manager',{url:'ad.jx',dataType:'json',data:{action:'listProfit'......  and a few more requests ofcourse. The only problem is that EVERYTHING occurs at the same time :)
13:20  sveajobb:  so it's not being queued, any pointers?
13:20  JKarsrud: TF22Raptor: Remove the last function, but put its content inside your second one?
13:21  sveajobb: sorry guys, I just realised the problem here..
13:21  sac: is there a way to do something right before element gets removed from DOM (directly via jquerys remove, or by parent being removed)?
13:21  TF22Raptor: JKarsud but then I love the swap back don't I?
13:22  TF22Raptor: I mean loose
13:22  TF22Raptor: loose the swap back?
13:22  ruby_on_tails: hi
13:22  ruby_on_tails: cant i apply sleep to a php script which jquery fetches via ajax ?
13:22  ruby_on_tails: to delay the result a bit ?
13:23  sac: you can
13:23  ruby_on_tails: seems it doesnt work
13:23  sac: php related though, not jquery related
13:23  ruby_on_tails: it sleeps forever
13:23  talented: why not delay the jquery?
13:23  sac: talented, to simulate longer response time
13:23  ruby_on_tails: yep
13:23  sac: i've done it so it's doable
13:23  JKarsrud: TF22Raptor: Setup an example at jsfiddle.net, hard to understand what you're trying to do
13:24  ruby_on_tails: i did sleep("3000"); in the php
13:24  ruby_on_tails: and no output coming to jquery
13:24  sac: sleep is seconds
13:24  sac: so try sleep(3) instead
13:24  ruby_on_tails: oh
13:24  JKarsrud: yay, sleep for 50 minutes! :D
13:25  ruby_on_tails: cool it works :D

13:29  TF22Raptor: JKarsud see this image. http://gyazo.com/08c14c22cd7dda960c1e0770b241727d.png my black button has an on/hover image and an off/mouse off image (thats the first 2 functions), when I am hovering this button I want it to change to its on/hover image but at the same time I want the "other image" to also change to something
13:29  TF22Raptor: JKarsrud see above
13:30  JKarsrud: TF22Raptor: Dude, if that's a button, just use :hover from CSS on the button itself
13:31  JKarsrud: And then use this: $('someButton').hover(function() { otherImage.attr('src','someOtherImage'); }, function( otherImage.attr('src','firstImage'); });
13:31  JKarsrud: It's not hard
13:31  iszak: He may not be able to if he's targeting IE6 but otherwise you're right.
13:32  JKarsrud: iszak: I don't care about IE6 in here unless people ask about it :)
13:32  JKarsrud: but yes, you are right
13:32  iszak: We are both right, yay!
13:32  JKarsrud: wohoo! :d
13:32  TF22Raptor: JKarsrud hehe for some for some. Yeah Im trying to keep all the interactivity inside Jquery itself
13:32  philk__: hmmm 1.4.4 does not support $(this).bind() anymore when this is just a plain object
13:33  iszak: define: plain object? it should?
13:33  JKarsrud: TF22Raptor: hover on a button is not something you'd want to push to jquery, as the browser does that job better already
13:33  JKarsrud: philk__ Yeah, that should work
13:34  talented: can I copy an element, remove it then place it back somewhere else? or can I clone a fragment excluding an element?

15:08  finfin82: div#ausgabe stays empty
15:08  finfin82: ;-)
15:09  templaedhel: What's the problem?
15:09  finfin82: the line where i fill div#bla is correct?
15:10  dr0id: this code is not working in IE, http://pastie.org/private/asf3m2zmbdby9l0aaqovna what could be the issue ?
15:10  finfin82: the point, that i have to fill a div inside of my template, and it doesnt get filled...
15:10  JKarsrud: finfin82: Bad way to do templating anyway, I think
15:11  finfin82: its very abstract ...
15:11  finfin82: i guess i will google to this term ;-)
15:12  JKarsrud: wouldn't something like var tpl = '<div id="test"><div id="bla">{0}</div></div>'; tpl.replace('{0}
15:12  JKarsrud: frack
15:12  JKarsrud: tpl.replace('{0}', 'filled'); augabe.html(tpl); be better?
15:13  templaedhel: finfin82: what does $(' div#ausgabe').length give?
15:13  finfin82: the point is, that i put some event-listeners to $tpl before appending
