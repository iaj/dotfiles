19:15 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 108 seconds
19:16  hadees: i'm having some problems with my code, i'm not getting any errors but it isn't working, i think i might have my selectors wrong or something,  http://pastie.org/1484903
19:16  jrockjiggz: I have content loading in via ajax, how can i find .closest('el') from the that loaded the content (mind i don't know the div)
19:16  Mage_Dude_Work: jriggins: I'm having an issue getting it to accept my json. It's jsonlint valid, and in the proper format, but it says "DataTables warning (table id = 'plantDataTable'): Added data (size undefined) does not match known number of columns (7)"
19:16  JKarsrud: hadees: campaign_group is not an input, it's a select
19:17  vacho: jQuery(".promo-ads li:nth-child(5)").fadeIn();
19:17  jrockjiggz: actually nm
19:17  JKarsrud: and how come you're not using an ID on that thing, it's way faster
19:17  vacho: shouldnt that fadeIn the fifth LI element of <ul class="promo-ads">???
19:18  hadees: JKarsrud: doh, thanks that was it
19:18  johnline: das hawt ajpiano
19:18  johnline: thanks for help
19:18  johnline: just gotta place the .delay in the right place
19:18  vacho: ajpiano the guru... got a sec?
19:19  Aquaguy: is there a function or something to convert a string into a valid url? http://83.147.72.125/upload/?name=highway to hell.mp3&size=3479542&type=audio/mp3
19:19  Aquaguy: that URL has spaces
19:19  Aquaguy: so to make it valid I need to parse it somehow
19:19  ngharo: encode
19:20  ajpiano: vacho: what's up, maybe, maybe not
19:20  jriggins: Mage_Dude_Work: I've not seen that myself, but stating the obvious...you're sure that your array in aaData matches your table dev in column count?
19:20  jriggins: table def(inition)
19:21  Mage_Dude_Work: jriggins: Yup. 7 and 7...but it seems that aData is 'undefined'
19:21  vacho: ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/0PMta7ah
19:21  jriggins: and you mean aaData right (not aData)
19:22  vacho: ajpiano: think I got it!!
19:22  thekidd: Question about sortable: Is it possible to get them to change position with the one that I drag and drop? Instead of moving all down one level. (Like if I move nr 7 up to position 2 the 2 will take the place of the 7 - from the example)
19:22  vacho: jQuery(".promo-ads li img:nth-child(2)").fadeIn();
19:22  Mage_Dude_Work: jriggins: aaData is the JSON part, I think that aData is an internal count of some kind
19:23  Aquaguy: anyone??
19:23  jinxdone2: Aquaguy, encodeURIComponent()
19:23  Aquaguy: jinxdone2 THANK YOU!!!
19:24  jriggins: Mage_Dude_Work: sorry Dude...I've never seen that one...gotta run for now...good luck!
19:24  Mage_Dude_Work: thx
19:27  jinxdone2: Mage_Dude_Work, i'd guess your data is of the wrong type.. like an object where it expects an array
19:28  jinxdone2: Mage_Dude_Work, Just my guess though.. since the error is ""Added data (size undefined)"" ... undefined is probably the result of data.length somewhere inside the code

19:29  vacho: I thought jquery had random?
19:30  EnlightenMental: anyone here familiar with jplayer for jquery? the reason I ask, is I'm wondering if anyone has solved the issue of using cookies to track the the current "time" of the audio file when the user navigates from page to page.
19:32  gulliva: I am trying to initialize a radio UI but the checked="checked" is not enough
19:33  ace_me: to get a input value before is changed I need to use $('.qty').focus(function (){ but how to use it in a $('.qty').blur(function (){ ?
19:34  jinxdone2: ace_me store it in a variable?
19:34  vacho: how do I generate a random number between 1 and 8 with jquery????
19:35  ace_me: jinxdone2 $('.qty').focus(function (){ valinit = $('.qty').val();});
19:35  jinxdone2: vacho look at javascript Math object
19:35  Zxurian: vacho: you don't need jQuery for that, javascript has it built in = random()
19:35  Krambfhase: ?g javascript math random @ vacho
19:35  bot-t: vacho, JavaScript Math Object - http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_math.asp

19:36  Krambfhase: ace_me: window.globalVar = oldvalue;
19:36  jinxdone2: ace_me, read about scope in javascript
19:36  ace_me: that's how is called :)
19:37  vacho: Math.floor(Math.random()*6) will generate between 0-6 .. I want between 1-6
19:38  jinxdone2: Math.random()*5+1 ?
19:40  vacho: of
19:40  vacho: c
19:41  vacho: var rand_number = Math.random()*5+1; jQuery(".promo-ads li:nth-child(rand_number)").show();
19:41  jrockjiggz: is there an easy way to check if radio is checked or not?
19:41  vacho: it seems the nth-child does not like taking my var
19:41  jrockjiggz: *if any radio are checked or still blank
19:41  serio: vacho, cuz you're not doing it right

19:42  Superman_: how to send multiple values via ajax to update in db
19:42  Krambfhase: vacho: how 'bout learning JavaScript before writing jQuery?
19:42  vacho: superman: use post and serialize a form
19:42  ace_me: jinxdone2  if I do $('.qty').blur(function (valinit){ then alerting valint is object
19:43  vacho: Krambfhase: but that should work?
19:43  Superman_: I'm using jeditable which is confuing me
19:43  serio: noooo
19:43  serio: I just told you what you need to do
19:43  Lumpio-: vacho: How could it
19:43  Krambfhase: console.log() @ ace_me
19:44  ace_me: console.log()  how
19:44  Krambfhase: ace_me: http://fixingthesejquery.com/ scroll to the right until you find console.
19:45  vacho: var rand_number = Math.floor((Math.random()*5+1));  jQuery(".promo-ads li:nth-child(rand_number)").show();
19:45  serio: vacho: http://jsfiddle.net/qXbN7/
19:45  vacho: My console log outputs integer.
19:46  jinxdone2: vacho.. your not actually using the rand_number variable in your select
19:46  serio: you cannot throw rand_number into a string and expect js to understand what the fuck it is
19:46  jinxdone2: vacho.. your not actually using the rand_number variable in your selector.. you have a literal string there
19:46  vacho: oh...
19:46  serio: which I said
19:46  serio: like WAY up
19:47  vacho: serio: sorry didn't catch that.
19:47  serio: check my example vacho
19:47  ace_me: nice thing Krambfhase
19:47  vacho: .. ild("+rand_number+")") ... solved it
19:47  serio: that's still a mad ugly way to do it, in my opinion.
19:47  Krambfhase: ace_me: created by ajpiano and yeah its awesome
19:48  vacho: serio: I did..you are not defining the between?
19:48  vacho: oh nice...ur taking the divs length.
19:48  vacho: clever.
19:48  serio: I wasn't really talking about that part though, you should just make the use of something like .eq
19:49  serio: so you don't have to concatenate the variable in the string
19:49  serio: anyway
19:49  serio: small preference
19:49  serio: as long as it's working

19:50  Crshman: hey guys, i'm using the ui resizeable plugin and i want to make some custom handles
19:50  Crshman: right now i'm appending a vertical lines div to the handles to create some verticle lines ala: http://ss.crshman.com/Selection_082.png
19:51  Crshman: http://ss.crshman.com/Selection_083.png
19:51  Crshman: however when selecing the div with the vertical lines the object does not resize
19:51  Crshman: any ideas on how to get around this?
19:53  serio: vacho, also, scap my use of parseInt
19:53  serio: Math.floor is more performant

19:59  Aquaguy: I'm implementing an HTML5 drag and drop uploader, it works great, it uploads the files, when uploading multiple files, it uploads all of them
19:59  Aquaguy: http://pastebin.com/YdN5jkN0
19:59  Aquaguy: but the response text of the XHR on uploadFinished just outputs one of the files.
19:59  Lumpio-: But... will it works on my corporate intranet which is optimized for IE 5.0?
20:00  vacho: serio: got it thanks.
20:01  Aquaguy: the PHP file echoes a json object for each uploaded file containing, file name, size, type and url

20:01  hobs: edit
20:01  hobs: http://trpdsah5.tumblr.com/
20:01  Aquaguy: In the uploadFinished method I just get the echo for one of the files, why?
20:01  Lumpio-: hobs: What?
20:02  ace_me: very nice ajpiano
20:03  hobs: I just thought since you were trolling html5 youd like a laugh
20:03  Lumpio-: tehe
20:03  vacho: serio: your code does not return a number.
20:03  ace_me: Krambfhase is complex enough to be a separate coder association ;)
20:04  Mage_Dude_Work: jinxdone2: Well the data in PHP is an array... but I suppose that doesn't mean much when it gets to the json parts
20:04  Krambfhase: if you say so
20:05  ace_me: but still need $('.qty').focus(function (){ valinit = $('.qty').val();  inside   $('.qty').blur(function (){.... any hint Krambfhase?
20:06  Superman_: is there a way to alert the success or failure message in jeditable plugin??

20:08  Vaevictus: is $("#target").fadeOut("slow").attr("src","newpic.png").fadeIn("slow"); correct/good to swap imageS?
20:09 --- Banktar is now known as Spanktar
20:09  pineappleclock: no
20:09  pineappleclock: you want to bind to the load event on the image to fade it in
20:10  pineappleclock: attr('src','newpic.png').load(function () { $("this").unbind("load").fadeIn(); }); or something to that effect
20:11 --- aspaulding is now known as jfelchner
20:11  thewanderer1: holy hell, my ISP doesn't like me asking in #jquery
20:11  Vaevictus: pineappleclock: gotcha.
20:11  PrgmrBill: time for a new ISP
20:11  serio: vacho, what are you talking about?
20:11  serio: it returns a div
20:13  vacho: http://pastebin.com/EsWnpJq6
20:13  thewanderer1: so I've figured out that I can refer to a Draggable like this: $(".ui-draggable")   - but if I access its position(), it is different than the one in callback (drag, for example) - why?
20:13  Vaevictus: dang... attr("src","fn") doesn't seem to swap the image
20:13  thewanderer1: if I access it inside callback, it's relative, but if I use the selector, the position is absolute
20:14  Mage_Dude_Work: jinxdone2: As usual... malformed json for the plugin. It's valid but not 'valid'.
20:14  Mage_Dude_Work: Anyone else think that if a plugin accepts json that there should be a special checker with additional validation?
20:14  ajpiano: thewanderer1, relative to what, the container?
20:15  thewanderer1: ajpiano: yes, the parent container
20:15  ajpiano: thewanderer1, that's like, on purpose
20:15  thewanderer1: ajpiano: but why is there a difference?
20:15  ajpiano: i'm pretty sure that when you're dragging something, it technically is absolutely positioned in the document
20:15  thewanderer1: I access it via callback - get relative; access it from outside callback, get absolute
20:15  thewanderer1: yes, it is
20:15  ajpiano: so draggable is normalising that and accounting for the parent container offset
20:15  thewanderer1: yes...
20:15  thewanderer1: but only in callback
20:16  ajpiano: whereas when you just use the selector and get the position it's telling you the offset relative to the document
20:16  ajpiano: yeah
20:16  thewanderer1: this is incoherent...
20:16  ajpiano: .position() just knows, this element is absolutely positioned and a child of the document
20:16  thewanderer1: cause the .ui-draggable is still inside the parent container...
20:16  ajpiano: ok yeah, i had a feeling i might have been wrong
20:16  ajpiano: :/
20:17  ajpiano: can you put together a fiddle
20:17  thewanderer1: a what?
20:17  cwd1: hello. i'm having trouble with ui-datepicker. with themeroller css, input is hidden. did i miss something?

20:18  thewanderer1: well... reproducing my site inside this?
20:19  jinxdone2: thewanderer1, i think you are confusing jquery's position() with jquery ui's position plugin
20:20  thewanderer1: jinxdone2: well, probably. but how else am I to get the position of the UI element?
20:20  jinxdone2: with jquery ui's position plugin
20:21  thewanderer1: uh, the code's ugly

20:22  jinxdone2: thewanderer1: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Position
20:22  thewanderer1: I did call: var c1 = $(this).position();    $(this) is an ui-dragged-something...
20:22  ace_me: how to use that window. ? http://jsfiddle.net/2JsCK/1/
20:22 --- JoshManders_ is now known as JoshManders
20:22  thewanderer1: well, I don't really need to position elements myself... I need to get their current position which results from dragging
20:25  thewanderer1: so... I can't get the relative position of the draggable, right?

20:28  jinxdone2: oh.. right. well it may take a bit of coding but it shouldn't be too hard to do that yourself
20:29  thewanderer1: I figure I just need to subtract the parent's x and y :P
20:31  ace_me: http://jsfiddle.net/2JsCK/2/
20:31  ace_me: can you show me how to get valinit every time I change the field value ?
20:32 --- jurica_ is now known as jurica
20:33  thewanderer1: ace_me: http://api.jquery.com/change/  is this what you need?
20:36  ace_me: thewanderer1 I need to calculate something based on the new value of a field ! qty1=1 qty2=2 and if I input qty=2 need tp make qty2=4 and if I do qty=3 than qty2 need the initial value of the field qty1
20:36  ace_me: that's why I try to get a global variable with focus and use it inside blur
20:37  thewanderer1: I don't think focus/blur is the way to go here
20:37  ace_me: but I don't know how to make the init varinit available in the blur
20:37  ace_me: focus means a possible modification of input value
20:37  ace_me: blur is the final value of the input
20:38  thewanderer1: well, let's say so
20:38  thewanderer1: if you really want to have a global variable, make it so
20:38  thewanderer1: just declare it outside of your functions
20:38  ace_me: second input value will be input2 val / valinit) * valfinal I think
20:40 --- aspaulding is now known as jfelchner
20:40  jinxdone2: there you go ace_me
20:41  ace_me: and call the function with it ! ?

20:44  Yuyo: <form><input type="text" id="foo_bar" name="foo[bar] /></form>      $('foo_bar').readOnly = true;  doesn't make the field readonly while   document.getElementById('foo_bar').readOnly = true;   does.. what's going on here? i verify that $('foo_bar') selects an HTMLInputElement
20:45  jinxdone2: yuyo: $('foo_bar') returns a jQuery object, it's not the dom node
20:46  fwaokda: i'm wanting to upload a picture to my database which jquery form plugin would be best for this?
20:46  thewanderer1: guys, does a draggable node need to have class ui-widget-content?
20:47  ace_me: thank you jinxdone2 but forgot to mention a each there http://jsfiddle.net/2JsCK/6/
20:47  ace_me: and still works
20:48  Yuyo: jinxdone2, hmm ok, why does using $('foo_bar') in the watches say that its type is HTMLInputElement then? and what do you recommend doing?
20:51  jinxdone2: Yuyo: $('foo_bar').attr('readonly', true);
20:53  Yuyo: jinxdone2, doesn't seem to work either
20:53  jinxdone2: no?
20:54  Yuyo: nope
20:54  jinxdone2: well you can get the dom node with $('foo_bar')[0] or $('foo_bar').get(0)
20:54  jinxdone2: if you prefer to use .readOnly = true
20:54  jinxdone2: but i think that earlier one i wrote should work.. hmm
20:55  erichynds: it's $('#foo_bar'), not $('foo_bar')
20:55  jinxdone2: oh lol :)

21:02  Cryp71c: Is there anyway to use fadeIn and fadeOut but maintain display: table-row or other display values?
21:03  Cryp71c: eg, a fadeIn fadeOut which changes opacity?
21:05 < Null_> how could I go about searching a serialized string for specific text?
21:06  Cryp71c: Null_, stringVar.indexOf(0
21:06  Cryp71c: indexOf() **
21:09 --- aspaulding is now known as jfelchner
21:10  Null_: Cryp71c: thanks
21:12  pineappleclock: Cryp71c perhaps wrap the html content in a div or span and fade that
21:12  pineappleclock: or you could animate the opacity directly
21:13  Cryp71c: pineappleclock, it looks like the issue is not with fadeIn() fadeOut(), I believe it will work for display: table-row.
21:14  hilko: I wrote a jQuery script that only seems to work when Firebug is on. Any idea why?
21:14  pineappleclock: is it calling console.log()
21:14  hilko: yes
21:15  hilko: a lot
21:15  Cork[home]: then you know why
21:15  pineappleclock: try commenting out the console calls and re-running it
21:15  hilko: interesting
21:15  hilko: I was not aware of that
21:15  hilko: I'll try that
21:15  pineappleclock: or create a wrapper function
21:15  Cork[home]: console only exist when firebug add it to the page
21:16  hilko: right
21:16  hilko: thanks, I'll try that
21:16  hilko: a wrapper function?
21:16  hilko: yes! it works
21:16  owen1_: i open new window with window.open(url). how to make it new tab instead of window (chrome)?
21:17  hilko: is there an easy way to leave the console.logs in there while I develop, but allowing my client to not use firebug?
21:17  hilko: never mind, I thought I'd google and I think I found a solution...
21:17  pineappleclock: yes you can replace console.log(x) with consoleLog(x) then create a function consoleLog(x) { }
21:18  pineappleclock: in that function, check for the existance of the console and then log it if it exists
21:18  hilko: duh, of course. didn't think of it
21:18  hilko: :-).
21:18  hilko: thanks! you guys saved me what could have been hours of figuring this out
21:18 * hilko high fives the channel
21:19  Cork[home]: hilko: window.console = window.console || { log: function(); };
21:19  Cork[home]: hilko: * window.console = window.console || { log: function(){} };
21:19  pineappleclock: oh that's better ;)
21:20  delinquentme: umm how about a jquery / js way to trigger the file browser ( like select a file upload ) on click?
21:20  Cork[home]: delinquentme: depending on your browser, that might not be posible
21:20  delinquentme: ahhh
21:21  Cork[home]: firefox < 4.0 demands that you actually click on the button, it can't be triggered at all
21:21  Cork[home]: i think some versions of ie has the same limitations
21:21  hilko: heh
21:21  Ely2: anyone here that has some experience with facebook open graph javascript SDK ?
21:22  hilko: the five-second solution is to do %s/console.log/consoleLog, add the latter function, and just comment out the contents of the function when I want the client to see it
21:22  hilko: yay
21:23  Cork[home]: hilko: the code example i gave you should work with out any code changes
21:23  hilko: oh, really
21:23  hilko: awesome
21:23  Cork[home]: ya, if firebug creates the console, it uses that one
21:24  Cork[home]: else its create a bumy
21:24  hilko: yeah
21:24  hilko: nice
21:24  pineappleclock: don't the parameter counts need to match?
21:24  hilko: I just spent an hour trying to handle a mysterious bug that turned out to be me not accounting for the differences between two different JSON 'objects'... solving something this quickly is a nice morale boost
21:25  Cork[home]: pineappleclock: not in js
21:25  pineappleclock: oh nice

21:27  Cork[home]: tcpsyn: you don't
21:27  tcpsyn: well thats a bummer
21:27  Cork[home]: tcpsyn: ajax is async, so it is returned to the ajax function
21:28  Cork[home]: and then it goes away
21:28  Cork[home]: tcpsyn: the code after the ajax call is most of the time called BEFORE the success

21:50  leks: what am I doing wrong here? I've got jquery and ui.core linked, jQuery.ui is an object, but jQuery().effect is not a function. does pulsate require other pieces of jquery ui?

21:53  lamdk`: not pro here, but isnt it jQuery.effect()   or $.effect()?
21:53  serio: $ = jQuery
21:53  serio: ie, sameshit
21:53  leks: jQuery.effect isn't a function either
21:53  lamdk`: doesnt spelling it out only work when you do noConflict or sumthin
21:54  leks: I am
21:54  serio: no, jQuery exists even if you don't use noConflict()
21:54  serio: no conflict just ensures that jQuery doesn't take over the $
21:55  serio: so you can use it with other libs that use $
21:55  leks: so if $.ui exists, $(this).effect() should too?
21:56  leks: or am i reading too much into the fact that $.ui exists?

22:05  serio: ah
22:05  serio: well then
22:06  Aquaguy: Cork[home] great, it works, what is form[0] why are you accesing the 0 index of that object?
22:06  Cork[home]: Aquaguy: that calls the dom native event trigger
22:06  leks: aha, thanks SugaSlide, it's just that the ui core I have from wordpress doesn't include .effect()
22:06  Cork[home]: so jquery doesn't know about it
22:06  aaroninfidel: serio: right now the magic number is 576 in portrait view to align it to the bottom... but I'm giving a fixed value and I'd like to get it dynamically: window.scrollY + window.innerHeight-576;
22:08  Cork[home]: aaroninfidel: why don't you just set display:fixed on the element?
22:08  Cork[home]: bottom: 0;

23:23  eazyigz_: TypeError: Object #<an HTMLImageElement> has no method 'bind'
23:23  blackspotwiggins: eazyigz_, you cant use .bind if you dont have jquery object
23:23  renegade001: Like CSS3 and some jQuery
23:24  blackspotwiggins: thats a stupid way to select something in the first place
23:24  JKarsrud: if you use [0] you're back on a normal js object, and that doesn't have jquery methods

23:25  renegade001: paul_irish: Got a better way? :D

23:25  eazyigz_: eTiger13: I have a UL with a class name, that has a bunch of LI's with class names, and each LI has an img

23:33  thewanderer1: most of the time they are correct but I managed to get 3 different readouts from this

23:35  jinxdone2: If I want to build some js applications that need desktop like features.. like layout manager, grid, panels, treeviews, toolbars and such.. what's the library/framework to go for these days? I love jQuery and jQuery UI but ther's just so many pieces still missing.. and using a bunch of misc plugins for jQuery is rather cumbersome to connect together in a corehent way
23:36  eTiger13: jinxdone2: if you dont mind obscure and screwed up licensing, ExtJS is the way to go
23:38  jinxdone2: Yeah i visited their site and was a bit baffled.. it's 800-900$ for the standard version with everything.. and apparently no upgrade possibility?
23:38  jinxdone2: if you only take the licence that's cheaper but no support or anything
23:39  eTiger13: jinxdone2: if you dont mind having to open source your code if someone asks for it, its free
23:39  jinxdone2: yes but my server software is proprietary
23:40  jinxdone2: *server side..
23:40  eTiger13: yeah like i said screwed up licensing
23:41  eTiger13: its sad really because it is currently the best thing on the market right now
23:42  JKarsrud: jinxdone2: it's not that hard to write your own widgets to UI tho, and it does provide a decent starting point. You could look into dojo too tho?
23:43  rebugger: JKarsrud: it just gets hard if you need a complex grid-control (mass-data support, sorting/hiding/locking of columns), ....
23:44  ajpiano: jqueryui team is in the middle of building a grid component right now actively
23:44  jinxdone2: Well, i've been using jquery ui so far, it's great.. but progress seems slow.. i have written a few widgets on top of the ui's widget factory.
23:44  ajpiano: jinxdone2: what kind of stuff have you written?
23:44  jinxdone2: well, a dataview component, and a middle piece for displaying my data as either dialog or panel
23:44  ajpiano: oh really?
23:45  ajpiano: the ui team is like, working on the datamodel for the grid componenet  right now
23:45  ajpiano: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid
23:46  ajpiano: sonds like your input would be valuable :)
23:47  jinxdone2: I've been using slickgrid for now though.. it's pretty nice
23:47  Insanity5902: I've got a problem with .clone() in IE, open to other suggestions http://jsfiddle.net/Ramk7/3/
23:48  Insanity5902: I'm wanting to duplicate a set of fields in a form, this works in all browsers but IE
23:48  Insanity5902: it will duplicate the fields in the window, but the aren't added in the dom and aren't being submited
23:48 --- nbari is now known as nbari|away
23:49  JKarsrud: ajpiano: stuff looks good, how far along are they?
23:49  ajpiano: still pretty early
23:50  ajpiano: jinxdone2: well if you have written a datamodel in ui that you can share
23:50  ajpiano: that would be ... pretty awesome
23:51 --- ehynds is now known as erichynds
23:52  JKarsrud: oh man, this jquery grid sounds like something we could use for sure
23:53  eTiger13: Insanity5902: that code is Insanity
23:53  Insanity5902: LOL
23:54  Insanity5902: that code has been disected while troubleshooting
23:55  Insanity5902: i tried to keep as much as the JS from the current itteration , and simplify the form
23:55  rebugger: Insanity5902: i tried to look at it, but its horrible ;) adding by appending .html() isnt cool ;) why not just .append(content)?
23:55  eTiger13: Insanity5902: simplify this bit: par.find('.duplicate:last').after(content);
23:55  ajpiano: Insanity5902: yo, check it... you can use .attr( with a function setter
23:55  eTiger13: second to the last line. you dont need to wrap it in div.duplicate since it already is in one
23:56  eTiger13: rebugger: you beat me to it
23:56  ajpiano: ?attr(...,function()
23:56  bot-t: ajpiano, .attr() - Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
23:56  ajpiano: meh
23:56  Insanity5902: Yes, the JS sucks, I'm working with what I was given
23:56  ajpiano: ah ok
23:56  eTiger13: then make it better
23:57  ajpiano: Insanity5902 $(".foo").attr("name",function(i,name) {  return name.replace("0",size);  });
