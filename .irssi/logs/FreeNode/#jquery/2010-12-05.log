00:05  dekhaus: Hi.  Is it possible to put a link in the section of an accordian in addition to the existing link (aka the one within the 'h3' tab) ?  If so - how ?  Thx
00:06  Rufus: wow, I'm so not good at this heh /me looks at devinrolsen and RTPMatt
00:08  RTPMatt: problems?
00:08  mathi: hi
00:08  mathi: how do I remove all $('span.receiverWrapper') elements except the first one ?
00:08  RTPMatt: dekhaus: AFAIK, there is not good way to do it
00:08  Rufus: RTPMatt I'm not sure what I must do to be honest. /me n00bish about jquery and such ;/ Would a link help maybe?
00:09  dekhaus: ok. any 2nd opinions ?
00:09  mathi: anyone ?
00:09  ronx: hey guys, i have a question about using jquery with SharePoint (2007). i've searched everywhere but can't seem to find a good explanation of the difference between _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames and $(document).ready
00:09  RTPMatt: mathi: $('span.receiverWrapper').shift.remove();
00:10  ronx: seems like they are both designed to do the same thing (execute when DOM is loaded/ready)
00:10  RTPMatt: Rufus: yes,m if you can give a link  thaqt is good
00:10  Rufus: RTPMatt sending via /notice
00:11  RTPMatt: ronx: there is a pretty big difference between when the DOM is ready and when the DOM is loaded
00:11  mathi: RTPMatt, $("span.receiverWrapper").shift is undefined
00:11  RTPMatt: shift()
00:12  RTPMatt: sorry, it is a function
00:12  mathi: RTPMatt, $("span.receiverWrapper").shift is not a function
00:12  ronx: RTPMatt, any insight into the difference between those two events?
00:12  Rufus: poor RTPMatt ;) Must be nickname
00:13  RTPMatt: mathi: you are right, i am bad
00:13  mathi: RTPMatt, it's not me, it's firebug :-)
00:14  RTPMatt: try $(..).slice(1).remove()
00:14  ronx: i'm wondering if they're interchangeable... _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames is a sharepoint function that adds functions to the body's onload event... whereas the jquery document.ready is jquery's way to do the same thing
00:15  devinrolsen: mathi $('span.receiverWrapper').not(':eq(0)').remove()?
00:15  mathi: $('span.receiverWrapper').slice(1).remove();
00:16  mathi: RTPMatt, devinrolsen ^
00:16  danheberden: $(me).find('bills').remove();
00:16  devinrolsen: lol
00:16  mathi: ahahah ))
00:16  danheberden: .animate()
00:16  ronx: RTP here too btw ;)
00:16  RTPMatt: ronx: the 2 you are lookin at, i am not sure, i dont know anythin about _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames
00:16  ultrarapid: RTPMatt: i found the problem, now i just don't know how to fix it with my modal, the problem is that the div that fills with an image sometimes get the wrong height and width, i guess it gets the value from the div width and height before the image is loaded and therefor the modal is off
00:18  RTPMatt: Rufus: i dont see the search call in there?
00:18  ronx: RTPMatt: k, nps, gonna debug a little and see if i can tell if there's a diff...
00:18  ronx: just wondering if anyone in here was doing jquery dev in sharepoint
00:19  Rufus: RTPMatt $( "#query" ).autocomplete({ source: "js/suggest.php", 	minLength: 1 });  it's what's doing the search
00:19  RTPMatt: ronx: maybe try them both at the same time and see which is triggered first?
00:20  RTPMatt: yeah, add: $('#query').click(function(){$( "#query" ).autocomplete('search')}); inder that
00:20  ronx: RTPMatt: yeah, that's what i'm doing... i threw in some alerts... first test showed _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames triggered first
00:21  ronx: but wondering if that's because it was listed first in the script block
00:21  ronx: e.g. if both are adding to the same body onload event
00:21  ronx: so i'm changing the order and see if it makes a diff
00:21  RTPMatt: ronx: .ready does NOT add to the body onload, it should in general fire long before that
00:21  ronx: problem is this damn sharepoint farm test environment doesn't have enough resources... taking forever to update the scripts
00:21  RTPMatt: so neither does the other one i guess
00:22  RTPMatt: the other might be better for your use
00:22  Rufus: Thank you RTPMatt. Worked like a charm.
00:22  RTPMatt: i dunno
00:22  RTPMatt: awesome
00:22  ronx: yeah sorry didn't mean body onload... meant just whichever onload they were using.. jmaybe it's the same
00:23  RTPMatt: if it fires before .ready, and it works for your need, it might be the way to go
00:23  Rufus: uhm, actually... That disabled the option to click one of the items in the autosugest list RTPMatt
00:24  ronx: if it fires before .ready, i'd be skeptical to use it since i'm using jquery to manipulate the dom...
00:24  ronx: even if it appears to work fine for me, what if i have some js files cached and it doesn't always work for other users, heh
00:25  RTPMatt: yeah, that would be my concern...so i guess it just depends on if it works...with .reay at least you know it wirks
00:27  ronx: yeah, but double edged sword... what if .ready doesn't take into consideration if all sharepoint pages are finished loading... which i doubt, but it'd still be nice to find a good explanation of the exact difference between the two methods
00:28  RTPMatt: Rufus: can you take out the line so i can check it out with out it again?
00:28  Rufus: Sure, sec RTPMatt
00:29  Rufus: Done
00:29  RTPMatt: Rufus: foir me i get the same error with or without that iline
00:30  Rufus: Hmm... smth was changed then. Give me a few minutes RTPMatt
00:30  Rufus: <-- not the only one playing with it it seems
00:31  danheberden: twss
00:31  trave: Is anyone familiar with a way to stylize a .buttonset() to work vertically?
00:31 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
00:32  trave: say ive just got 16x16 icons, and want them stacked ontop of eachother, and have the corners of the first use top left and right, instead of left top and bottom, visavi the last one too?
00:32  Rufus: Ok all fixed now. Thank you RTPMatt
00:32  RTPMatt: sure thing
00:32  Rufus: Your line was good
00:36  ultrarapid: i have a modal which loads images, the modal is centered by calculating window/document size and popup-size. but sometimes when the server is slow the size of the popup is calculated without the image which puts the modal way of the center, any one know any sollution. code: http://jsfiddle.net/SXjBm/
00:38  RTPMatt: ultrarapid: you could add a .load() to the image that positions it correctly
00:40  ronx: interesting... when i moved the _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames underneath the document.ready block, this time document.ready fired immediately before _spBodyOnLoadFunctionNames.. but i got the 2nd alert on top of the 1st (instead of the first alert blocking until dismissing it)
00:40  ronx: so it seems like i can probably use either one
00:41  ultrarapid: rtpmatt can i do that when i get the image by an ajaxcall. i mean i get a html-part from ajax which is <img src=".....">
00:45  RTPMatt: ultrarapid: well, doing a .load() on an image can be a bit trickey, you can add one, you can do something like have the ajax return you <img _src="..."> then add that to the dom, attach the .load() event, the change the _src attr to just src to be REALLY sure that it will fire
00:47  RTPMatt: actually writing that out gave me a better idea
00:47  mathi: gtg, thanks for the help
00:47  RTPMatt: just make it a live/delegate event for the .load() on your image
00:48  RTPMatt: then it should work just fine
00:51  ultrarapid: hmm haven't done that before, ill check it out and ask you if i don't get it :p
00:51  RTPMatt: ok
00:53  RTPMatt: actually, i just tested it, i don't think load will work with live
00:54  jmorris: im looking for a tooltip for jquery like this: http://www.nickstakenburg.com/projects/prototip2/
00:54  RTPMatt: ..it sounds like it should though
00:54  jmorris: any recommendations ?
00:55  ultrarapid: RTPMatt do you know if it works with delegate? or is live() needed also?
00:56  RTPMatt: they work the same way, so if one does not work, i dont think the other will.  let me test real quick
00:56  flying_fortress: jmorris, like this? http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
00:57  jmorris: flying_fortress: im going to have a form in it
00:57  jmorris: seems like that one disapears
00:58 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
00:59  RTPMatt: yeah, the delegate and live both do not do it for me...that is unfortunate
01:00 --- kdrsx is now known as kuadrosx
01:01  ultrarapid: in your previous sollution, why would i want to remove the src from img?
01:03 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
01:03  RTPMatt: well, you need to make sure that you attach your load handler before the image is loaded, so if you add the ser attribute after attaching the load handler, you will be sure that it is attached before the image is loaded
01:05  ultrarapid: ok then i understand
01:06  jsilver: guys what library do i use if i want to pop a lightbox of an HTML pages i.e. an IFRAME thansk
01:07  flying_fortress: you want to open a lightbox like inlay popup containing a secondary website?
01:07  RTPMatt: jsilver: jquery UI dialogs and thickbox are both good choices
01:07  gnycl: hey
01:07  RTPMatt: hi
01:08  gnycl: Hi all, have a quick question on using a bunch of new shiny JS tools out here
01:08  flying_fortress: http://fancybox.net/ and http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/ come to mind in this case
01:08  gnycl: has anyone had any luck using CoffeeScript with Jquery with zencoding technique?
01:08  gnycl: does it all parse correctly
01:09  jsilver: ty flying_fortress RTPMatt :)
01:09  gnycl: ie no probs converting coffeescript to javascript?
01:09  gnycl: forget i even mentioned zencoding
01:10  gnycl: wow
01:10  gnycl: thanks a ton flying_fortress
01:11  flying_fortress: what for?
01:11  gnycl: links provided
01:11  gnycl: very useful hopefully
01:11  RTPMatt: yw
01:11  flying_fortress: they were for jsilver but okay
01:11  flying_fortress: xD
01:12  jsilver: gnycl: try js2cs
01:12  jsilver: hehe
01:12  jsilver: doesnt work on jquery tho
01:12  jsilver: just javascript lite
01:12  jsilver: no support for $,
01:12  jsilver: you could add it
01:12  gnycl: jsilver: thx
01:12  jsilver: ;) bp
01:12  jsilver: np
01:13  jsilver: thanks all
01:13  jsilver: ill keep trying
01:24  ultrarapid: RTPMatt: thanks alot for the help, it worked very well
01:28  RTPMatt: sure thing

12:07  SugaSlide: <div class="wrap"> < lobby_panel ></ loby_panel> < lobby_data > </ lobby_data> </div>
12:08  JKarsrud1: why not use data-attributes to store the tooltip data, and just have one tooltip that positions itslelf relative the to the triggering element, with the text of the data attribute?
12:10  JKarsrud1: I have no idea what the usecase is, as I just joined, but that would be my suggestion :)
12:11  SugaSlide: JKarsrud1 http://jsfiddle.net/yg4eg/
12:11  SugaSlide: lol
12:12  JKarsrud1: amagad
12:13  SugaSlide: i had the same reaction
12:13  SugaSlide: the html is a bit.. messy.. but looks sweet
12:13  JKarsrud1: Ahh, lulz
12:13  JKarsrud1: It wasn't a tooltip at all :o

12:30  Nightbox: but in jquery :D
12:30  Nightbox: i dont
12:31  JKarsrud1: look at my example

12:43  SugaSlide: play nice :P

12:44  JKarsrud1: SugaSlide: Yeah
12:44  SugaSlide: could do somehting like...
12:44  JKarsrud1: Exactly
12:45  SugaSlide: nvm
12:45  JKarsrud1: Nightbox: If you modify your markup to not have the details separate from the panel itself, it makes more sense, and would make it easier for you to code as well
12:46  Nightbox: im just php coder :D
12:46  JKarsrud1: no matter, now you can own your designer with semantics :P
12:47  JKarsrud1: I'm making an example now :)
12:47  frigginSnowedIn: odd, it returns undefine for .data('panel')
12:47  frigginSnowedIn: and .data() returns an object that doesn't contain panel
12:48  SugaSlide: .attr("data-panel")
12:48  SugaSlide: .data("panel")
12:48  Nightbox: i cant disagree with you but can i have a solution ? :D
12:48  SugaSlide: should return the same thing
12:48  SugaSlide: solution: redo the markup
12:48  Nightbox: i cant personally
12:49  Nightbox: i'm not the designer :D

13:41 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 135 seconds
13:41  yareckon: i.e. I have a function that loads content after a click.... at the end of this function, it also sets up a pager to be clickable
13:42  yareckon: but the pager links are firing right on the load of the content
13:42  yareckon: I tried .click and .bind('click' and both fire
13:42  JKarsrud_: yareckon: paste some code? :)
13:44  yareckon: http://jsfiddle.net/yN2Xq/
13:45  yareckon: it's pretty naive stuff, and the mediaArray variable holds the result of an ajax call earlier
13:45  yareckon: just trying to get it working,,, then gonna rework the embed code, so don't worry about that
13:46  yareckon: those two click functions at the bottom are firing right away, causing it to instantly page through all the videos returned
13:50  yareckon: I just want bind to click, not trigger it the function .. I assume I am doing something wrong here.  I supposed a *very* remote possibility is that this is a bug in the old version of jquery 1.2.6 shipped with drupal 6

13:52  linusoleander: temp01: Okey, how do I know when all images a loaded?
13:52  yareckon: linusoleander, is that a question for me?

14:08  Aple: I'm making this basic web-app. I'm trying to make it so when you click '#images a', it sets '#output img' src to the same src that was in '#images a' attr src.
14:08  Aple: Can anyone browse my code and tell me what I'm doing wrong? It looks right to me but isn't doing anything: http://pastie.org/1349236
14:09  JKarsrud_: Aple: use e.preventDefault(); in the click event
14:10  Aple: TL;DR - I want to change a different image's src onclick. http://imgur.com/XKrkB.jpg
14:10  JKarsrud_: $('#images a').click(function(e) { your code; e.preventDefault(); });
14:10  Aple: k 1 sec
14:10  JKarsrud_: pass in e to the handler get the event
14:11  Aple: Yeah, did so, still nothing. Let me upload a working version of this.
14:11  JKarsrud_: did you see this: $(selector).click(function(event) {});
14:11  Aple: http://pressedweb.com/example/app_bug/
14:12  Aple: Yeah, I added the 'e'
14:12  JKarsrud_: Aha
14:12  Aple: Basically I want to be able to click that pizza (or chef) and it replace the src of that "Logo Goes Here" image.
14:13  JKarsrud_: You need to get the src of the image, not the a
14:13  JKarsrud_: $(this).find('img').attr('src')
14:13  JKarsrud_: not $(this).attr('src')
14:13  Aple: Oh, that makes sense :)
14:13  JKarsrud_: a doesn't have a source attribute :)
14:14  Aple: Awesome. Thanks JKarsud_ :)

14:14  Aple: Yeah, I notice that now. Simplest things blow by me.
14:15  JKarsrud_: We all make simple mistakes :)
14:15  Aple: What's the deal with adding the 'e' ?
14:15  Aple: I see a lot of people add function(e), or function(evt), etc...
14:16  JKarsrud_: then you get the event (in this case "click"), so that you can get info from it
14:16  JKarsrud_: like e.target, e.currentTarget etc etc, and it enables you to prevent default behaviour with e.preventDefault, stop propagation; e.stopPropagation etc
14:16  JKarsrud_: If that makes sense? :)0

14:29  JKarsrud_: no difference for the server
14:29  Back2Basics: I'm using formwizard plugin - if you don't see step 2 or the questions or the nav buttons then where do you usually look for the problem?  (javascript or html code)
14:29  Chris64: mh, okay, thank you

17:20  beeviz: hey guys
17:20  beeviz: i've got a json object
17:20  beeviz: and i need the key to a certain value
17:20  Nightbox: i have a column called online: if user is online then its 1, if offline its 0; the really problem is that how can i track if user is offline (inactivity, closed browser)
17:20  beeviz: any idea how
17:20  beeviz: e.g: {0: 'foo', 1: 'bar'}
17:20  beeviz: getKey('bar') --> 1
17:21  RTPMatt_: beeviz if it is an object, you access it the normal way to access an object: object.bar
17:21 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 131 seconds
17:21  beeviz: yes. but in this case, 'bar' is the value
17:22  RTPMatt_: oh, sorry, then: object.1
17:22  beeviz: yes. i know ;)
17:22  RTPMatt_: oh, you are trying to get it backwards?
17:22  beeviz: but i only know "bar" and i need the according 1
17:22  beeviz: exactly
17:22  RTPMatt_: then use $.each to look over it and pick out the one you need
17:22  beeviz: i need something like getKeyByValue()
17:22  RTPMatt_: Nightbox: so, the problem is keeping that column up to date?
17:23  Nightbox: yeah, how to know if user closed the tab/browser
17:23  beeviz: yes. that's the way i'm using. i thought there's a more easy way maybe
17:23  Afuna: beeviz: it won't work exactly like that, since there's no guarantee that the value is unique.
17:23  Nightbox: and update the column would not be the problem but tracking that would be
17:23  RTPMatt_: beeviz: i think that is the best way
17:23  Afuna: so there might be multiple values of "bar"
17:23  beeviz: i know
17:24  beeviz: in case of multiple values, the function should return another array/object
17:24  beeviz: with all keys ;)
17:24  beeviz: so i think the $.each() way should really be the best
17:24  beeviz: thanks
17:27  RTPMatt_: Nightbox: yeah, there is no way I have found to do that that I _really_ like.  I would probably do something like every time the access a new page rest a timestamp to the current time and assume that if the timestamp is more than X number of minutes old, they are offline.  You can also do a synchronous ajax call in the onbeforeunload to update it, which i really don't like.  I don't know. ...
17:27  RTPMatt_: ...If someone has a better idea, I would like to hear it.
17:28  Nightbox: thats what i dont want to do
17:28  Nightbox: i know that is the "classic" method
17:28  Nightbox: but im thinking with new web scripts to be able to connect to user
17:28  Nightbox: keep a link
17:28  Nightbox: and if the link is broken, change online to 0
17:29  RTPMatt_: Nightbox: i don't think there is a way to do that that would be friendly to most browsers
17:29  Nightbox: hmm
17:29  Nightbox: i thnk of doing a constant ping
17:30  Nightbox: every 30 sec to user
17:30  Nightbox: and if ping is timeout update status
17:30  Nightbox: is that possible ?
17:30  Nightbox: to ping someone ?
17:30  Nightbox: hmm
17:30  Nightbox: get his ip and then do ping ?
17:31  Nightbox: oh, thats not page related :(
17:31  RTPMatt_: Nightbox: not really, you could have the user touch the server, but no the other way
17:32  RTPMatt_: Nightbox: you could (I am NOT saying you should) have the page do an ajax request on a URL every 30 seconds and use that to keep it updated
17:32  Nightbox: yeah
17:32  Nightbox: that would be USER Ping :D
17:32  RTPMatt_: basically

17:41  keres: $('body').keyup doesn't seem to work at all
17:41  keres: It doesn't fire
17:44  RTPMatt_: keres: The keyup event is sent to an element when the user releases a key on the keyboard. It can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form elements can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.
17:44  keres: Ok, so there is no way to do that?
17:44  RTPMatt_: not as far as I know

18:55  ralc: i though you got my link before, sorry
18:58  Hory: ralc: when you set the top and left position of the draggable, it's relative to the element that contains it
18:58  Hory: put the dragger div directly in the same element as the target
18:58  krz: if i do .clone(); does the element stay in memory until the page is reloaded?
19:00  ralc: Hory, yeah that would be a solution, but i need it to stay in a temporary location before pageload
19:00  Hory: put it hidden in the container
19:00  Hory: and display on load
19:00  ralc: i'm using it for a grading system, so if a user has already graded an item, the score holder will 'swoop' up into its position
19:00  krz: anyone?
19:01  trave: If I have 75% of 200, (150) im struggling with converting 150 back to the original width of 200, its not 125% like my mind first assumed, its more closely to 133.5% ? ... Is there a simple calculation to find that "reverse" percentage?
19:01  Hory: also you need to set position: relative on the container and position: absolute on the draggable
19:01  Hory: it's 150/75*100
19:05  trave: Thanks Hory
19:07  ralc: Hory, it's not an option for me to put target and draggable in the same div
19:07  ralc: i have many many targets, but a limited set of draggables, so it wont do
19:08  Hory: then put the draggable in the element above the target
19:08  Hory: put it in body if you like
19:09  ralc: ah, let me try that
19:11  JuJuBee: Im trying to learn to use $.ajax  and have trouble with http://pastie.org/1349885  How do I get the return data from the php script?  Currently php just echo's "Success".
19:12  amf: what call do i use to get the modification date of an image file?
19:14  ralc: seems to work, thanks Hory
19:14  Hory: JuJuBee: the script looks ok, what's happening?
19:15  JuJuBee: I get nothing added to my messageDiv ( I expect "Success" as echo'd from php script)
19:17  robert2: is there anyway to know when .html() has finished populating an element with content? I need to setup a binding on some of the content after it has been inserted
19:18  JuJuBee: Hory: any suggestions?
19:19  Hory: only to specify the datatype as html so jquery doesn't have to guess
19:19  Hory: but that's probably not it
19:20  JuJuBee: the dataType is the type of the data being sent to server? or received from?
19:20  Hory: received
19:20  JuJuBee: let me try
19:20  JuJuBee: no change
19:21  Hory: get firebug and double-check that the content of the php is what you expect
19:23  JuJuBee: Hory: wow, i just tried to php newTest.php in cli and it worked and now works on web....
19:24  robert2: hrm this is tough.
19:24  robert2: async nature of JS is cumbersome sometimes :O
19:25  Hory: robert2:  shouldn't the element population with content be instantaneous?
19:27  Hory: or are you talking about an entire process like loading the html from somewhere and then populating?
19:28  robert2: Hory: making a request through AJAX, and then populating the result in an element.
19:28  robert2: Hory: takes about >= 500ms to populate the element(I'm missing setTimeout)
19:28  robert2: seems like a hack tho
19:28  robert2: ajaxComplete is too soon as well :(
19:29  Hory: it takes 500ms only for the .html() function after the request to load the content is completed?

19:32  robert2: Hory: I wonder could it take longer on slower machines.
19:32  robert2: Hory: my solution is flakly.
19:33  Hory: well as far as I know the population should be instantaneous
19:33  Hory: it may be the browser that lags while displaying the change
19:33  robert2: ok
19:33  robert2: so 500ms is 'safe'?

21:41  djino: I am particurarily confused about extracting those values
21:43  cohitre: djino: $.get( $("a").attr('href') )
21:43  cohitre: no need to extract the individual values if the link is already pointing to your resource

21:48  vrtigo: i need to make an ajax indicator that overlays the div related to the ajax event
21:48  vrtigo: so like
21:49  vrtigo: think a list of li's, with prev/next links that update with content via ajax
21:49  vrtigo: when those links are clicked, the div surrounding the ul needs to have appended an ajax loader gif div
21:50  vrtigo: the problem im having is that ajaxStart needs to be attached to a specific element, but i want it to be global
21:50  vrtigo: $.ajaxStart isnt allowed
21:50  vrtigo: hmm.
21:51  vrtigo: apparently you cant use $.ajaxSetup to define default beforeSend/complete callbacks
21:52  vrtigo: scratch that - it actually does

23:00  topping: hi guys, i am just learning jquery, have a page with tabs and a document.ready function that works just fine in the safari console but not when I load the page.  are tabs tricky like that?
23:00  topping: the ready function logs to console, so i know it's getting called
23:01  snover: topping: Are you sure you are not confusing “not working” with “I forgot to load the jQuery UI css”? :)
23:02  topping: haha, thanks but I don't think so!  wouldn't I have problems using it from console if that were the case?
23:02  snover: I don’t know what that is supposed to mean exactly since you can’t, like…render your site in the Web Developer console
23:04  ragefuljoe: can someone point me to a reference on how I can wrap an image around a 3d object? I want to be able to manipulate the object…basically I'm skinning the object I guess
23:04  snover: ragefuljoe: are you sure you are in the right place?
23:04  topping: snover: i probably don't know what i am talking about, this front end stuff is new to me.  but when I render the page and bring up the web console, I can do a selector with an .addClass and it changes the display elements just peachy
