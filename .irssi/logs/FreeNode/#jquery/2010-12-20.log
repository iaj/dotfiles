00:00  zamba: RTPMatt: it worked if i just created a blank .html page and put a simple string in it
00:00  Drule: $closest('.panel').slideUp();
00:00  Drule: will someone just tell me what's wrong with this
00:00  snover: it’s wrong :)
00:00  Drule: how
00:00  Drule: ive tried so many different variants of $closest, $parent, $toggle, slideUp() etc. and I can't even get the damn thing to react in any way
00:00  mekwall: $(selector).closest()
00:00 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:00  RTPMatt: zamba: are you doing a console.log() of the return inside of the callback?
00:00  mekwall: $jqueryobject.closest()
00:01  mekwall: ?.closest @ Drule
00:01  bot-t: Drule, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/

00:02  Bizzeh: rmurphey: so i could check if Modernizr.borderradius = false, then dont apply rounded corners to something?
00:02  Drule: Okay guys, thanks.
00:02  rmurphey: Bizzeh: there are all sorts of ways to use modernizr :)
00:03  mekwall: meh, need to get up in 6 hours... but not tired at all :/
00:03  rmurphey: but yes, the general idea is that it does feature detectgion and then you do stuff depending on whether a feature is present
00:03  Drule: $('.header').$closest().slideUp();
00:03  Drule: shouldnt this work then?
00:03  rmurphey: Drule: where are you gettting $closest from?
00:03  Drule: whoops
00:04  Drule: i meant -$
00:04  rmurphey: and, .closest() requires a selector
00:04  rmurphey: ?closest
00:04  bot-t: .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
00:04  Drule: what's a selector
00:04  Drule: i thought $('.header') was the selector
00:04  rmurphey: '.foo' is a selector
00:04  rmurphey: $('.header') returns a jquery selection
00:04  rmurphey: '.header' is the selector in that case
00:05  rmurphey: once you have made a selection, calling .closest() on the selection does .. well, exactly what the docs say it does
00:05  rmurphey: it gets the first element that matches the selector that you pass to .closest()
00:05  rmurphey: starting with the current selection and working up through the tree
00:05  Drule: Well if you say that $closest needs a selector, isn't that exactly what I was doing at first
00:05  mekwall: ?selectors @ Drule
00:05  bot-t: Drule, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
00:05  rmurphey: Drule: no
00:06  rmurphey: it's not what you were doing
00:06  Drule: er i meant closest()*
00:06  rmurphey: you must *pass* a selector to the .closest() method
00:06  rmurphey: .closest('li')
00:06  rmurphey: .closest('h1')
00:06  rmurphey: .closest('.whateverclassyouwant')
00:06  mekwall: Drule: also, you must have already selected another object to use .closest on
00:06  rmurphey: $('.header') is the *selection* on which you are calilng .closest()
00:07  mekwall: $item = $('#foo'); $closestbar = $item.closest('.bar');
00:07  Drule: This is over my head. I don't think I'm going to get this.
00:07  Drule: Thanks for helping though.
00:08  mekwall: Drule: the dollarsign before the vars is not needed... I merely use it for internal purposes, easier to track which vars (should) contain a jQuery object
00:08  Drule: All I'm trying to do is select the parent object of the object I am clicking on
00:08  mekwall: Drule: in jQuery, $ is used as an alias for jQuery... it's just a variable name like any other
00:08  Drule: $('#sidebar .panel .header a.minimize').click(function(){
00:08  Drule: 					closest('.header').slideUp();
00:08  Drule: 				});
00:08  Drule: this is what i have
00:09  mekwall: $('#sidebar .panel .header a.minimize').click(function(){ $(this).closest('.header').slideUp(); return false; });
00:09  mekwall: is probably what you want
00:09  joshwins: $(this) is what you didnt have :)

00:09  bot-t: Drule, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
00:09  mekwall: ^---- go read that Drule :)
00:09  rmurphey: you may want to spend some quality time learning the basics & doing the exercises
00:11  Drule: That worked mekwall, thanks.
00:11  mekwall: Drule: and you should learn why.
00:12  Drule: Meh, the pieces will fall into place when I've messed around with this for a bit. ;-)
00:12  mekwall: Drule: or when you've wasted our time :)
00:13  mekwall: seriously, for everyones well-being you should check out jQuery fundamentals
00:13  Drule: Don't get me wrong, I always google and look through documentation, but as I'm not a programming-oriented person I find it very hard to dig through material like this. It's *very* long-winded and unintuitive for someone who isn't already into programming.
00:14  Drule: I don't want to come across as a douche or anything, but it's hard to read documentation like this when you're not into coding terminology.
00:14  mekwall: Drule: jQuery fundamentals is not documentation :)
00:15  mekwall: Drule: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
00:15  randomOfAmber: I have an animation that's called in a couple of different circumstances.  how can I disallow animate() on that element until all other animations have finished?
00:16  Drule: Oh, I thought this was the material provided on the official jquery page.
00:16  mekwall: randomOfAmber: check if animation is running with the :aninmated selector
00:16  randomOfAmber: snap, thanks
00:16  mekwall: :animated*
00:16  Drule: I'll have a read then.
00:17  mekwall: Drule: best of luck :)
00:17  Drule: Thanks.
00:18  g0bl1n: I'd like to open a new window, give it size values, and set a link via jQuery. Can this be done via jQuery core ?
00:19  RTPMatt: ? jsis @ g0bl1n
00:19  bot-t: g0bl1n, javascript is javascript is javascript
00:19  g0bl1n: something like this "window.open( '/help/fee/','help', 'menubar=1,resizable=1,width=350,height=250')
00:19  mekwall: randomOfAmber: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/VfAyD/
00:19  mekwall: you might want to check that out
00:20  mekwall: it's a little test I did with animation queues :)
00:20  randomOfAmber: awesome :D
00:20  randomOfAmber: that's pretty cool, thanks

00:34  mekwall: zamba: yup
00:34  mekwall: zamba: timer = setInterval(fn, duration)
00:34  mekwall: zamba: then you can use clearInterval(timer) to stop it
00:36  kbm: mekwall: i cant destiguish between an abort and a host unreachable. they both look identical

00:36  Univ: http://pastebin.com/nxaqA8r3
00:36  kbm: status 0
00:36  kbm: :(
00:37  Univ: anyone can tell me why _intervalHandler is called
00:37  Univ: but why firefox keeps saying "_parse is not a function"
00:37  Univ: ?
00:39  mekwall: kbm: host unreachable should be timeout hrm
00:40  kbm: its not.. they look identical
00:40  kbm: i console.dir()ed them
00:41  mekwall: weird
00:42  zamba: how can i return a specific value from a $.get() call?
00:42  mekwall: they should be distinguishable in one way or another
00:42  zamba: or rather, set a value for use in an "outside" function
00:42  zamba: i'm sorry if the question made no sense :)
00:42  mekwall: zamba: by using the callback?
00:43  zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/4Qq5k/
00:43  zamba: this is the code, so you can probably see what i'm trying to accomplish

00:44  zamba: mekwall: i tend to agree :)
00:44  zamba: mekwall: i usually use duh.html for testing purposes, but that file was already used for something else :)

00:45  zamba: heh, yeah
00:45  kbm: mekwall: http://pastebin.com/ZwstzDAY
00:45  Univ: webben: thanks !
00:45  zamba: mekwall: but do you know how to fix my code?
00:45  kbm: heres the proof
00:45  webben: Univ: wrap your call to _intervalHandler in an anonymous function to fix.
00:45  mekwall: zamba: well, you can do whatever you want inside that function(data) { }
00:45  zamba: mekwall: i want to get that one value out
00:45  zamba: mekwall: so far unsuccessful
00:45  mekwall: zamba: since now_playing will return before .get is finished, you can't do the changes in that function
00:45  zamba: mekwall: oh
00:46  zamba: mekwall: but you see what i'm trying to accomplish, yeah?
00:46  kbm: mekwall: the top part is the dump off all the params to error() after abort() was called
00:46  mekwall: I see
00:46  kbm: mekwall: the second part is the host unreachable
00:47  kbm: k
00:47  mekwall: kbm: no idea mate :/ that's something to do with xhr itself
00:47  kbm: ..
00:47  kbm: is there anyway for me to stop that callback?
00:48  zamba: mekwall: how do i make fix?
00:48  mekwall: zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Qq5k/1/
00:48  mekwall: something like that
00:49  zamba: mekwall: where's the interval?
00:49  zamba: mekwall: i need to run setInterval("function", returnedrefresh * 1000);
00:50  Univ: webben: It works! You're the dude =)
00:50  zamba: mekwall: because that function shall be rerun every x second
00:50  mekwall: zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Qq5k/2/
00:51  mekwall: don't use setInterval with ajax requests :P
00:51  mekwall: well you can, but I rather use timeout
00:51  zamba: one sec, i'll try something
00:52  mekwall: zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Qq5k/3/ <-- should run the check again, one second after the previous one completes
00:53  zamba: mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/4Qq5k/4/

00:53  kvnn: So, does anyone know how to mix sortables with indentation?
00:53  splanquart: can u help me on ajax no data problem?
00:54  kvnn: splanquart : what data type are you using? xml or json

03:07  losing: adamaig, give the li's you want to be sortable a specific class and then use the items options: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#option-items

03:09  adamaig: ul.item_traits contains li.item_trait contains a ul.item_trait_values which contains li.item_trait_value ... i try setting up a sortable for each ul in that hierarchy
03:09  qom2: are you sure? looks fine to me
03:09  Brodingo: NiftyLettuce adding queue false to your animation would work aswell

03:51  Billy1: is there a way to activate the overlay the jqueryui dialog uses without using a dialog? I'm currently using blockui(which works great), except in IE8, it blocks the dialog after its been opened. I tried playing with the z-index with no success

04:17  Forbidd3n: Is there an editor that allows the user to see a visual html editor instead of the html itself using markdown?
04:17  dstanek: is there a good way to scroll a page so that a certain element is in the center?
04:17  lithi: Uh what?
04:17  Forbidd3n: I am looking at using this, but the user must know html to use it. http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/
04:17  Forbidd3n: I am looking for a visual editor kinda like tinymce does it
04:17  dstanek: right now i have a goofy function getting the element's offset and using scrollTo to move things around
04:18  duellsy: @dstanek perhaps you coudl use scrollto, and do some math to find the height of the element and the height of the window to find where to scrollto
04:18  duellsy: haha so, same as what i suggested
04:18  duellsy: not neat enough for you? or is it jumpy?
04:19  Forbidd3n: anyone on the wysiwyg question?
04:20  dstanek: duellsy: it seems to be working OK, but I was hoping that there was an easier way
04:23  duellsy: @dstanek hmmm yeah not sure, nothing that i can think of is already smart enough to know where to stop the scrolling
04:33  somnium: How do you get jquery-ui tabs to load content via ajax only once? Tried binding to 'tabselect' but no success.
04:34  Forbidd3n: anyone that recommend a visual wysiwyg editor with image upload feature using jquery
04:35  Forbidd3n: I was going to use markdown, but the user has to know html to use it, I need something like tinymce, but lightweight using jquery
04:36  duellsy: somnium: .tabs( "option", "cache", true );
04:37  somnium: duellsy: thanks!
04:38  duellsy: somnium: work?
04:39  mattems: duellsy: hey!
04:39  duellsy: mattems: sup homes
04:40  etpace: do I need to use juqery any differently if I have it inside my <body> tags? just a <body> .. <script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function() { .. });</script></body> should be fine?
04:42  duellsy: etcetera: should be fine
04:42  duellsy: provided you aren't loading mootools or something else that is using $
04:42  somnium: duellsy: yeah, fixed everything. even made my nested tabs work.
04:43  etpace: hmm.. for some reasons it's not working at all, and in firebug i can only view my loaded .js files
04:44  duellsy: somnium: awesome :D

06:12  marckohl: hi all
06:12  marckohl: when using a click event handler, how can I make sure it is NOT activated when an element inside the binded element is clicked
06:13  marckohl: say I have a paragraph with some text and an image… I bind an click-event to the paragraph, how can I make sure it isn't activated when the image is clicked. (or inside the function, how I can determine which element was clicked)
06:14  iszak: marckohl, check the event.target
06:15  marckohl: iszak: thanks, seems like what I was looking for
06:16  marckohl: yep, cool
06:16  marckohl: this worked: if(this == event.target)
06:17  marckohl: or if(this != event.target) break;
06:17  marckohl: (haven't tried the last one, but should work)
06:20  marckohl: perhaps a css question, bot how do I select all elements that DON'T have a certain class
06:21  marckohl: ah, never mind
06:21  snover: marckohl: Have you tried reading the documentation?
06:21  snover: there we go. :)
06:21  marckohl: :not(.classname)
06:21  marckohl: I was thinking too complicated
06:21  marckohl: forgot about the :not selector
06:21  marckohl: it's 6:21am here, should probably go to bed soon hehe
06:27  dans: i have the following code: https://gist.github.com/748055
06:28  dans: its working except, once i click the link the style (css) is not exactly as it should be
06:29  marckohl: have you set the :visited and :active pseudo classes?
06:29  marckohl: also, what do you mean with "is not exactly as it should be" ?
06:31  dans: i mean the font goes back to times new roman
06:31  dans: the layout seems ok
06:31  dans: but the font styles are gone
06:31  dans: infact padding margins etc goes too
06:31  dans: it's as though the page has no css
06:32  marckohl: the whole page?
06:32  marckohl: oh wait
06:32  dans: yeah im replacing 'html'
06:32  marckohl: I didn't really look into your code too much, but you're replacing the whole HTML I see now
06:33  dans: perhaps body instead?
06:33  marckohl: yeah, try that
06:33  dans: yeah, thats done the trick
06:33  marckohl: I'm not sure whether the browser re checks the stylesheets after it has been loaded
06:33  dans: i was thinking that the new page should have <head> too though
06:33  dans: and load the css
06:33  dans: but obviously .get() ignores it?
06:33  marckohl: I guess de external stylesheets are loaded when the page is requestes, and that's it
06:34  dans: yeah, ok
06:34  marckohl: *requested
06:34  dans: thanks marckohl
06:34  marckohl: no problem, you figured it out yourself :)
06:35  dans: :)
06:36  marckohl: Anyone know this? When doing a element.slideUp(); it unhides all its children, can this behavior be disabled?

07:02  Bhavic: Hi, would anyone know if this is right: I have a <div id="domain56"></div> and then $('#domain56').val("hello2"); , but it doesn't seem to change.
07:02  Bhavic: It's getting called.
07:02  Bhavic: Just isn't changing
07:04  Bhavic: even trying to get val() doesn't work
07:04  Bhavic: It returns empty.
07:04  Bhavic: Like it doesn't exist
07:04  Bhavic: But it does
07:04  letterpress: are you trying to put the text "hello2" inside the div?
07:04  OhaiBBQ: val gets the value attribute for inputs
07:05  letterpress: cause that would be $("#domain56").text("hello3");
07:05  Bhavic: Oh
07:05  Bhavic: How would i get the value of text inside a div?
07:05  Bhavic: just .text() ?
07:06  letterpress: um that would return the text inside the div, if that's what you're asking
07:06  Bhavic: Ah right. Thanks!

09:23  JKarsrud: Do you get any errors in your console?
09:23  JKarsrud: And do you have a link to the plugin itself?
09:25  JKarsrud: You haven't included all the right scripts, man
09:26  JKarsrud: First off, you're using jquery 1.2.6, which is effin' old, plus you don't have the easing-plugin in there. There might be some functionality in jquery 1.2.6 that's missing
09:28  epaphus: JKarsrud, hmm i got that from http://jqueryfordesigners.com/demo/coda-slider.html ... but i think ill just modify the official sites examples rather. Sorry and thanks.
09:28  JKarsrud: yeah, that's old. And it doesn't even auto scroll

09:35  mekwall: var trackMouse = $(document).bind('mousemove', function(){}); $.unbind(trackMouse); would make sense :)
09:35  mekwall: but ofc that doesn't work :)
09:36  Hishi[Revo]: Cant be that easy aye. :D
09:36  sean`: mekwall, no
09:36  sean`: var trackMouse = functino () { }
09:36  mekwall: sean`: doh :P
09:36  sean`: .bind ('mousemove', trackMouse);
09:36  mekwall: ofc
09:36  mekwall: !!!
09:36  sean`: .unbind ('mousemove', trackMouse)
09:36  sean`: or .. use a namespace

09:44  mekwall: I know
09:44  mekwall: that's the part I'm gonna tackle now
09:44  mekwall: and refine the code itself
09:44  mekwall: I dislike using jquery ui position
09:45  mekwall: sean`: actually, auto-align does seem to work... except the callout is on the wrong side :)
09:45  mekwall: sean`: options for that tooltip is that it should show up to the right of the target, but shows up to the left
09:45  sean`: it'd be more koole if you use data-*
09:46  mekwall: for what?
09:46  mekwall: content?
09:46  potatodemon: If I have nested anon functions, how can I set a global variable inside of them?
09:47  sean`: mekwall, options
09:47  mekwall: potatodemon: define it outside of the functions, and then just set it?
09:47  sean`: like positioning

09:49  mekwall: potatodemon: your console.log() will fire long before that success callback will fire
09:49  jomofcw: Morning mekwall ;).
09:49  JKarsrud: getJSON is async
09:49  mekwall: jomofcw: mornin :)
09:49  potatodemon: oh shit, make it sync then ?
09:49  JKarsrud: meaning it's callback will only fire when the request is done, and your console.log(all_done) will fire an hour before that
09:49  mekwall: potatodemon: asynchronous functions will run in the background while the rest of your code will be executed programatically (which is close to instant compared to an ajax call)
09:50  JKarsrud: potatodemon: Use it inside the callback instead?

10:51  DragoneneWork: as soon as I attempt to use it, the datatable stop sworking

11:00  sean`: can't you distinct on class?
11:00  sean`: or do like $('#uniqueparent td.someclass')

12:49  thinced: url matters
12:49  giampaolo: thinced: sorry?
12:50  thinced: You can't get anything with ajax from outside. If you need, then you should use jsonp
12:50  giampaolo: the JSON gets downloaded (I see that in firebug). only problem is that the callback function is not called
12:50  Rantanen: Malformed json?
12:51  JKarsrud: yeah, try jsonlint.com and see if the json validates
12:51  ravenzz: no data passed to the callback?
12:51  JKarsrud: If it doesn't, that's your problem. jQuery doesn't call success for malformed json
12:55  fresco_: is there a simple way to load an array of scripts in parallel (using $.getScript, probably) and fire a callback once they've all loaded? perhaps firing the same callback after each scripts loads and doing something once a counter increments to the number of scripts?

12:56  Bennit: (if I check my console for $("a.iframe") I get an array back
12:56  Bennit: should be included
12:56  ravenzz: JKarsrud on success the callback needs the data to be passed? i mean getJSON(url,foo(data)) ?

14:45  SugaSlide: no my cock is not 20" long
14:46  sean`: SugaSlide, ..
14:46  SugaSlide: lol
14:46  SugaSlide: i some how doubt thats the Q she wanted to ask right?
14:47  Hopsy: A 32-year old female falls from the 10th floor of her apartment building in an apparent suicide attempt. Upon presentation, the patient had obvious head and extremity injuries. primary survey reveals that the patient is totally apneic. By which method is the immediate need for a definitive airway in this patient best provided?
14:48  Hopsy: A. orotracheal intubation, B. Nasotracheal intubation, C. Percutaneous cricothyroidotomy, D. intubation over a bronchoscope or E. needle cricothyroidotomy
14:49  SugaSlide: the bag thingy
14:49  RTPMatt: F. she is dead already
14:49  SugaSlide: and the morg van
14:49  SugaSlide: lol
14:49  SugaSlide: my answer is F
14:49  SugaSlide: and if she isnt dead... she should be..
14:49  mytoz_: D.

14:52  BAttila: sorry, i answer a post before 1/2 hour. :)
14:52  Hopsy: and G was?
14:52  sean`: Hopsy, nasotracheal intubation
14:52  SugaSlide: same as F
14:52  Hopsy: why not Z?
14:52  vladikoff: why not 37?
14:53  Hopsy: anyway
14:53  Hopsy: this is the answer
14:53  Hopsy: A. In a patient with significant blunt mechanism of injury and head injury, the cervical spine should be protected against further injury. In an apneic patient with the potential for cervical spine injury, orotracheal intubation may be attempted with in-line stabilization of the neck. if this is unsuccessful percutaneous cricothyroidotomy is the best definive step.
14:53  sean`: I had it right
14:53  sean`: I said C
14:53  Hopsy: it was A -_-'
14:53  SugaSlide: lol
14:53  sean`: if this is unsuccessful percutaneous cricothyroidotomy is the best definive step.
14:53  sean`: I actually said B
14:53  sean`: so that means I was closest

14:57  chachan: I have 3 DIVs that have the same name, what I want the text of one of them when are clicked?
14:57  Hopsy: but it has two times N sean`
14:57  sean`: Hopsy, yeah, it's missing X
14:58  chachan: I'm doing this: $("div.toolbar-button").text()
14:58  chachan: but I got the text of 3 of them
14:58  SugaSlide: give each div an ID
14:58  chachan: I just want the clicked
14:58  SugaSlide: o
14:58  SugaSlide: $(this)
14:58  RTPMatt: chachan: when you give it a .click handler, this inside of the function is the one you clicked
14:58  SugaSlide: $("div").click(function(){ $this.text()
14:58  RTPMatt: so just to $(this).text()
14:59  SugaSlide: $(this)
14:59  Hopsy: or use eq?
14:59  SugaSlide: na
14:59  SugaSlide: since its which 1 was clicked
14:59  Hopsy: owh wait
14:59  Hopsy: now i see
14:59  SugaSlide: unless you work out the index of the clicked div
15:00  chachan: but I'm testing for firebug console making $("div.text-toolbar")[0].text()
15:00  SugaSlide: then do eq... but its ALOT easier just uing this
15:00  chachan: and I get wrong method or something
15:00  Hopsy: its not an array
15:00  Hopsy: you cant just put an [0] behind that :p
15:00  chachan: $("div.text-toolbar") returns me an array
15:00  sean`: chachan, $('div').bind ('click', function () { var $this = $(this); console.log ($this.text ());});
15:01  RTPMatt: chachan: $(foo)[0] give you the dom node, you need the jquery of the dom node, use $(foo).eq(0) for that
15:01  chachan: Oh!
15:01  chachan: I see
15:01  ablomen: it _is_ an array (or kind of) but its an array of dom elements
15:01  chachan: I will try with eq(0)
15:01  chachan: :D
15:01  chachan: yep

15:05  sean`: oh wait, in a toolbar

15:19 --- Boohemian_ is now known as Boohemian
15:20  Nomikos: hmm.. but only for one div
15:23  Nomikos: okaycool: curious, can you make this work if there are more than one div?
15:23  okaycool: Nomikos: you mean if there is another div inside the parent div i am targeting?
15:24  Nomikos: or just one after it
15:24  okaycool: let me try that. working on client site but what the heck ;)
15:24  Nomikos: I'm playing around with it now :) and can only get the first div to listen
15:25  Sam_Place: Hi all, I'm working on a jQuery Mobile webapp. Has anyone else here seen a problem with webkit browsers not clearing the loading message after page load?
15:27  Nomikos: I guess all the <p>'s are dumped in one set, of which only one can be 'first'
15:27  sean`: :firts-child
15:28  sean`: ?:first-child @ okaycool
15:28  Nomikos: not applicable, other elements may sit in front of it

15:30  Nomikos: BarelyFitz: I'm just playing with it, but the first <p> element of any <div> element
15:30  Nomikos: regardless of other elements inside divs
15:30  Nomikos: I can get there with an each(function() {..}) but that seems overkill somehow..
15:30  sean`: okaycool, $('div').find ('p:first')..
15:30  okaycool: sean`: yep got it :)
15:30  sean`: <3
15:31  Nomikos: See :-)

15:32  Nomikos: JKarsrud: a little 'stop' sign?
15:32  abracsi: or $("div p").first() ? would that be more efficient?
15:32  halcyon1234: Is this the right way to prevent an a tag from default clicking? (the # and return false, that is)....
15:32  halcyon1234:   <a href="#" class='foo'>Hi</a>   ... $("a.foo").click(function() { doStuff(); return false;  } )
15:32  sean`: abracsi, that own't work
15:32  sean`: ?mdc preventDefault @ halcyon1234
15:32  bot-t: halcyon1234, event.preventDefault - Cancels the event if it is cancelable, without stopping further propagation of the event. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.preventDefault
15:32  abracsi: no?

15:33  halcyon1234: Thanks, Sean.
15:33  sean`: s/row/result set/
15:33  JKarsrud: Nomikos: Yeah, that's the best one so far, but I'm not entirely sure I like it....
15:34  JKarsrud: Plus this icon set didn't have one, but a previous version of it does
15:34  Nomikos: JKarsrud: google images for 'cancel' ?
15:34  JKarsrud: So I'll just style it to look the same
15:34  sean`: Put a picture of mr t
15:34  JKarsrud: Nomikos: Yeah, but is X really a good icon for cancel?
15:34  JKarsrud: Does it speak cancel?
15:34  Nomikos: Well, /sort/ of.. it's context dependent, obviously
15:35  Sam_Place: an X embossed on a circle makes sense for cancel
15:35  sean`: how about a round circle with a c in it
15:35  Nomikos: Copyright? :_
15:35  Nomikos: :)
15:35  sean`: ?

15:37  jes: Does hide work with toggle?
15:37  sean`: Yeah
15:37  sean`: that's a good cancel button
15:38  sean`: jes, you can do .toggle () to show hide an element
15:39  Trisox: hello :)
15:39  sean`: hey Trisox
15:40  jes: just asking if hide will work on a toggled object. (I want to hide it no matter if it's visible or hidden).

15:42  blackspotwiggins: Dirkos, $("#id1, #id2")
15:42  Dirkos: i want #photo-wrap OR #user-wrap
15:42  Dirkos: ah , :)
15:42  Dirkos: ok thnx
15:42  blackspotwiggins: but it's not exactly OR
15:42  blackspotwiggins: you get both of them
15:42  superdmp: hello - I wonder if anyone can recommend a JQuery-based script that will allow me to re-create something along the lines of the image carousel at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/wales/ ?
15:42  Dirkos: yeah does not matter :) one div on top of the other so
15:43  sean`: Dirkos, that's not nice
15:43  Dirkos: "," is the thing i need
15:43  sean`: If you need or, then do or
15:43  sean`: , is and
15:43  Dirkos: not nice?
15:43  Dirkos: , works like an or?
15:43  Dirkos: just tested it
15:43  sean`: no
15:43  sean`: it's AND
15:43  blackspotwiggins: needs moar powerpuff girls for extra nice
15:43  JKarsrud: it's and
15:43  Nomikos: isn't it and/or ?
15:43  sean`: no
15:43  JKarsrud: no
15:43  Dirkos: works for me though
15:43  Dirkos: i click at the first div and it works
15:43  sean`: it's and, but if jquery doesn't find soething, it doesn't mean it stops
15:43  JKarsrud: it just selects both
15:43  Dirkos: and the other works too
15:44  JKarsrud: yeah, that's an and right there
15:44  Dirkos: ah ok well :) it works, most important
15:44  Dirkos: but is there an or btw?
15:44  JKarsrud: the first works AND the second
15:44  JKarsrud: :)
15:44  sean`: $.fn.or = function (s) { return this.length ? this : $(s); };
15:44  Nomikos: but if it can't find the first, it will still work on the second?
15:44  JKarsrud: yeah
15:44  sean`: $('#foo').or ('#bar')
15:44  Dirkos: k
15:44  Dirkos: thnx
15:44  sean`: Dont' assume stuff is what you need, 'cause it works now
15:46  blackspotwiggins: i dont think "," is AND. with AND, if one operand is false you get false (nothing)
15:46  JKarsrud: it's and in CSS
15:46  Nomikos: yeah, semantics, in SQL it's different
15:47  blackspotwiggins: more like in logic
15:47  JKarsrud: Okay, maybe it's not and. Maybe it's an array of selectors for jquery to look for :)
15:47  blackspotwiggins: it's just separate queries, no logic between them
15:47  JKarsrud: but it's definetely not or
15:47  sean`: blackspotwiggins, it's and
15:48  Nomikos: It depends a bit on how you interpret 'or' and 'and'..
15:48  blackspotwiggins: it's closer to or than and IMO
15:48  sean`: $('#adsfadsf').SMD() will work
15:48  sean`: doesn't return false
15:48  blackspotwiggins: ?
15:48  sean`: $('#foo, #bar').SMD () will work on both when available, therefor it's an and operator
15:49  sean`: blackspotwiggins, if #adsfadsf doesn't exist
15:49  blackspotwiggins: if #foo didnt exist it would still work for bar
15:49  blackspotwiggins: not and :D
15:49  sean`: yes
15:49  sean`: It selects ALL
15:49  sean`: So it selects #foo and #bar
15:49  sean`: if #foo doesn't exist, it still continues
15:49  sean`: heck if both don't exists
15:49  Hopsy: bot-t: tell SugaSlide to say goodbye before disconnecting
15:49  bot-t: Hopsy, Okay.
15:49  Hopsy: omg
15:49  blackspotwiggins: but and would not continue when one operand fails
15:49  sean`: but int he selector, it's read as an 'also for ..'
15:50  sean`: blackspotwiggins, agreed, but it isn't an operand
15:50  sean`: It's a selector notation to include another set
15:51  blackspotwiggins: so it's a bit presumptuous to call it and if it's not a logic operator :P
15:51  sean`: meaning it's open for intepretation
15:51  sean`: and imo the closest intepretation I can link it to is an 'and'
15:52  sean`: or 'if available also'
15:52  sean`: but I really prefer and
15:52  Nomikos: I'm just going to call it the 'comma operator'
15:52  blackspotwiggins: im going to call it steve. just because
15:52  abracsi: union :-p

16:21  blackspotwiggins: Trisox, use html5 version and scale the <video>
16:21  Trisox: it needs to be in ratio
16:21  Trisox: its for mobile devices
16:21  RTPMatt: delinquentme: no it would not
16:21  blackspotwiggins: ratio calculation should not be too difficult :)
16:22  Trisox: widht is 100% of the screen
16:22  Trisox: height should be like 40% of the height
16:22  Trisox: of the width
16:22  Trisox: sorry
16:22  RTPMatt: delinquentme: using a live/delegate event would be a better choice
16:22  Trisox: RTPMatt wy not bind?
16:23  blackspotwiggins: delegate/live uses a single event handler
16:23  blackspotwiggins: bind uses n
16:23  Trisox: k
16:23  Trisox: any ways could some one point me in a direction?
16:24  RTPMatt:  Trisox: 1. selecting nodes by the href attribute is slow to begin with so for 100 elements it would be vers low.  2. binding to 100 elements nomatter what they are is going to take a long time
16:24  delinquentme: RTPMatt, if the process were User Clicks >> If ( "X" URL) >> do Z .. it would be fine .. but it would definitely NOT be the best option if there was existing code added to each and every link ... is this what the live/delegate event stuff is .. and where do i read more please :D

17:20  tsyrak: and does it make a difference using null or false for a timeout var?
17:20  MarcelT3: lo all.
17:20  mekwall: if (typeof waitForDC == 'object')
17:21  mekwall: or something
17:21  jes: $('#automatas').change(function() { var a = 5;
17:21  mekwall: tsyrak: nope
17:21  tsyrak: yeah i could use setTimeout right?
17:21  MarcelT3: just wondering: is there a nifty plugin to push divs to the bottom of another div with jquery?
17:21  mekwall: tsyrak: try try :P
17:21  MarcelT3: inside that other div, of course
17:22  Trisox: mekwall sorry didnt work
17:22  mekwall: Trisox: it does work on jsfiddle

17:22  Trisox: some how it doesnt do the height
17:25  Altreus: swearing at my JS. My stuff is running in an iframe. I think jQuery is getting confused about the location of all the DOM elements because the top of the iframe is not the top of the main page. Is this likely?
17:25  mekwall: Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/BJj36/6/

17:28  Trisox: same result
17:28  mekwall: Trisox: something else then
17:28  mekwall: the code is working
17:28  Altreus: erichynds: Do you know of any solutions?
17:29  Altreus: google is just returning questions
17:29  Trisox: yup it is :)
17:30  erichynds: Altreus, are you trying to access elements within the iframe from the parent?

17:30  Altreus: It is the things I attach to the contents that are not working right.
17:31  erichynds: is the iframe on the same domain?
17:31  Altreus: for example, the drop zone for my droppable is not in the same place as the droppable itself
17:31  Altreus: yes
17:31  erichynds: can you put together something on jsfiddle.net ?
17:31  Altreus: the JS works to an extent; it just seems like all the positions are out
17:31  erichynds: or pastie coads
17:31  Altreus: I'm not sure how to demonstrate an iframe on jsf
17:31  mekwall: im giving up for today!

17:33  Altreus: yes
17:33  Altreus: the event is firing
17:33  Altreus: It's just firing in the wrong place

17:44  timmywil: np
17:48  eric256: i've got a link on a page, that has an href="javascript: saveThis()", i'm registering an event handler for that link, that code makes a jsonp call and returns false, the jsonp call then calls the .trigger event of that same link passing an additional value so that the second time its called my handler knows to return true
17:48  ajpiano: sounds convoluted
17:48  eric256: this all seems to work, except that the "saveThis()" function doesn't get called the second time through the event... and i'm not sure if its related to my code or if the trigger method isn't working like i am expecting it
17:49  eric256: it is convoluted, i'm tacking javascript onto a thirdy part solution so that we don't edit a ton of their code
17:49  ajpiano: why don't you just not use the a href=javascript: link to begin with, and do all the evnt handling in jquery
17:49  ajpiano: oh
17:49 --- unruthless_ is now known as unruthless
17:49  ajpiano: trigger only triggers jquery-bound handlers afaik
17:49  eric256: yea...not realy my favorite solution, but if i can get the trigger to actualy call the javascript: then i'll be set
17:50  eric256: can i eval the links href or something?
17:50  timmywil: eric256: i'd try evt.preventDefault() instead of return false
17:50  ajpiano: eric256, you *can* :/
17:50  eric256: timmywil: i tried that first, but it seemed to stay in effect both times through the event handler instead of just the first....i'll try agian though
17:50  eric256: maybe i had something else broken
17:51  timmywil: ah, just a first thought
17:51  eric256: ajpiano: yea...thats kinda what i thought lol
17:51  eric256: i almost need a triggerDefault :)
17:52  eric256: yea with preventDeafult it gets all the way through my handler both times, but second time if doesn't activate the href...but that might be more related to calling trigger on the link... don't know how else to get to their code after mine executes
17:53  eric256: coudl just hardcode a call to their saveThis(), but i'm worried that as soon as i do that they'll push an update and sometimes the link will have different code lol
17:56  eric256: so no jquery way to trigger a link  and have it behave just like a user clicked it?
17:56  ajpiano: no, you can't trgger the native click, essentially
17:56  timmywil: eric256, no, you can trigger native clicks, but only in certain browsers, and it gets dirty
17:57  timmywil: so it's best not to try, but does the eval not work?
17:57  eric256: lol okay...just found an edge case that kills me anyway...they call their saveThis from somewhere else too...can i wrap that function somehow?  i.e. put my own code around it
17:58  jes: Can i do .css('border', '1px solid red'); ?
17:58  eric256: timmywil:  i hardcoded the call to saveThis for now and that works...just have to watch their updates, which i'll have to do anyway, like that better than evaling
17:58  timmywil: that's an idea, you could do var _saveThis = saveThis; window.saveThis = //mystuff  _saveThis();
17:59  timmywil: hacky fun
18:00  Danny_Joris: Hi all, I'm using jquery_ui 's stortable functionality. I have a table that contains TR's of different height. I would like the placeholder to have the same height as the row that is currently being dragged.

18:20  kanzie: using $.autocomplete, I just want to pass the resut of a conditional statement.
18:20  kanzie: I tried putting the statement in a function in a variable and then add the var to the url
18:20  kanzie: but didnt get it to wokr
18:20  ajpiano: using source:function(request,response) { $.ajax({data:{foo:"bar",q:request.term},success:response});    }
18:21  ajpiano: kanzie, you have to roll the request yourself
18:21  kanzie: ajpiano: any pointers as how to do that
18:22  ajpiano: yea
18:22  ajpiano: the LINE OF CODE I JUST TYPED
18:22  kanzie: ok, didn't understand that was for me
18:22  kanzie: good thing you caps'd so I know

18:23  ajpiano: lol
18:23  ajpiano: kanzie, you really hate trying things, don't you
18:23  kanzie: ajpiano: not at all, been trying things for quite a bit before asking
18:23  ajpiano: if that's "out of your league" then you can't pass custom data
18:23  kanzie: but when I see that snippet I might as well just code it in brainfuck
18:23  ajpiano: so you should try to change leagues
18:23  ajpiano: lol
18:24  kanzie: I dont think the code in itself is to difficult, once I understand what it is you mean by it
18:24  kanzie: ajpiano: having a tough day today?
18:24  ajpiano: look at this example http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache

18:28  ajpiano: one is the request, which contains the value that is currently typed into autocomplete

21:46  manouch: hello... in the documentation of jquery ui it is written, that overwriting "select" with a do-nothing function won't update the input field
21:46  ajpiano: sherl0ck, tbh, in 3 yrs, i've never seen someone even try to do that
21:46  manouch: but it is updated anyway
21:46  ajpiano: so, it's most certainly uncharted territory
21:46  manouch: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-select <--- this is the documentation part
21:47  ajpiano: manouch, you needt o actually cancel the event, not a function taht does nothing

21:50  ajpiano: like isaid, i've never seen anyone even try it
21:50  sherl0ck: snover: i was kinda wondering about that, what r the drawbacks?
21:50  ajpiano: probably...cause it's not a good idea
21:51  StoneCyqher: adding new protocol verbs is fine, you just have to know the protocol really really well to do it right.  if you don't know what idempotency is, don't even try.
21:51  sherl0ck: broswer support i was guessing
21:52  StoneCyqher: no, protocol verb extensions have been fine since gen 4 browsers.  it's just something that you need an old gray ninja beard to do.
21:52  snover: sherl0ck: jQuery certainly won’t be able to understand whether one of your new verbs is idempotent or not, or if it can accept a message body or not, any of the other restrictions that go along with HTTP verbs, and there’s no way to extend it to know those things.
21:52  StoneCyqher: and if the answer is "i guessed that", then no, don't do it.
21:52  StoneCyqher: what?
21:52  StoneCyqher: snover: don't use words you don't understand.  all verbs are idempotent.
21:52  snover: I mean, without going into the source directly
21:52  StoneCyqher: well except get.
21:53  StoneCyqher: and get should be, except for a protocol specification flaw./

22:28 @paul_irish: filter() probably

22:28  hdon: paul_irish, ah, thanks :)

22:29  hdon: peol, i won't be selecting on classes though :)
22:29  peol: i know, bot-t is just being a douche
22:30  hdon: do i have to do something like
22:30  hdon: .filter('[name='+name+']') ?
22:31  hdon: that doesn't leave me feeling very safe
22:31  hdon: i guess a little safer might be +uneval(String(name))+
22:31  hdon: but what a pita
22:31  erichynds: i prefer .filter(function(){ return this.name === name; }); in those type situations
22:31  hdon: erichynds, ah, ok :) well since i am iterating over the results anyway, i think i will just put that as a condition in my .each() function :)

22:32 --- joshsmith_ is now known as joshsmith
22:35  marek_z: okay so I added an array into a jQ object with $().add(listOfElems) but when I call addClass on it, the elements don't get the class. they only get it if I use this.addClass from within an .each() call on the jQ object. Shouldn't the first variant work too?
22:36  marek_z: oh and I just realized I can shorten that to $(listOfElems)
22:42  abracsi: hi guys, i'm playing with draggables / droppables.. i was wondering if there were any dom order/zindex concerns when doing this sort of thing?
22:42  Cork[home]: abracsi: concerns?
22:43  Cork[home]: as in bugs or what?
22:43 --- perlite_ is now known as perlite
22:44  abracsi: yeh like, when something is being dragged. does it change it's position in the dom at all.. i mean are there any usual rules to follow when setting up your layout
22:44  marek_z: it gets fucked
22:44  Cork[home]: abracsi: yes there position in the dom is chaned
22:44  Cork[home]: *changed
22:45  gnarf: actually - i think by default the dragable doesn't move position in DOM, just position attributes in CSS
22:45  Cork[home]: gnarf: no it moved in the dom, else it would have to use absolute positioned elements
22:46  Cork[home]: the position while its dragged is another matter though
22:46  gnarf: Cork[home]: it could use relative positioned too
22:46  Cork[home]: (if that waht was the question i'm sorry and miss understood)
22:47  abracsi: ok cool, so basically, if i have 2 sibling divs, and i want to drag another div from inside one to inside the other
22:48  Cork[home]: its absolut positioned while its dragged, and droped into its new parent ya
22:48  abracsi: then you'd just start it inside one of them, or as a sibling to those droppable areas
22:48  gnarf: Cork[home]: relative positioned
22:48  Cork[home]: gnarf?
22:49  Cork[home]: you mean while its dragged?
22:49  gnarf: yeah
22:49 * Cork[home] checkes
22:49  abracsi: suppose relative to the container..
22:50  mokush: hey, where is the mobilize function in jquery mobile?

22:50 --- lux_ is now known as Guest99963
22:51  abracsi:  Cork[home]: so would you place the draggable as a sibling to the droppables, or as a child of one of them, and then manipulate the dom on drop
22:51  abracsi: that's what i am getting at :-)
22:52  Cork[home]: abracsi: where you want to put it depends on what you want to do
22:52  Cork[home]: your building a list or?
22:52  gnarf: abracsi: check out sortables ?
22:52  abracsi: not checked those out yet
22:53  abracsi: would my example not be a common use for draggable and droppable?
22:53  gnarf: abracsi: draggable just lets you move an element around
22:53  janthony: Is there any easy way to make an index or random .eq() display in a container with jquery, or will I need a plugin for this? For example <div id="myContainer"><div>div 1</div><div>div 2</div><div>div 3</div></div>  #myContainer { display: none; } then have jquery randomy select a .eq from the given eq set, in this exampe, 0, 1 or 2 and do a .show() on it.
22:53  gnarf: droppable allows events to be fired when draggable things are droped
22:53  janthony: I know how to do everything but how to build/create a number to place in the .eq(random number).show()
22:53  gnarf: by default, draggable/droppable don't move items around in the DOM
22:54  gnarf: sortables actually will change position in dom
22:54  abracsi: sure.. i would have thought a standard function to trigger on drop would be to append the draggable
22:54  zxiest: Hey there... Can someone tell me more about jquery mobile?
22:54  Cork[home]: janthony: the eq is a reference to the index in the internal jquery array for your selected elements
22:54  gnarf: abracsi: yes - you can do it that way
22:54  abracsi: right
22:54  abracsi: cool
22:54  janthony: Cork[home]: I'm aware of that. :P
22:55  gnarf: but sortable already does some of that...
22:55  abracsi: ok cool, i'll look into sortables now then. cheers
22:55  janthony: I know that .eq(0) will grab the first div, .eq(1) will grab the second, etc... I want to display a random div inside the given container
22:55  Cork[home]: janthony: so you would have to know its position in the array, no real way to build or create that number
22:56  Cork[home]: janthony: s.eq(Math.random() * s.length) ?
22:57  gnarf: abracsi:  http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/AGgZA/
22:57  gnarf: note you can drag from #zone1 to #zone2, but not the other way around
22:57  Cork[home]: oh, you need an Math.floor too
22:57  janthony: Cork[home]: I can try it... :P We could use .length to grab the eq range, and then somehow figure out a way to grab a random number from the index range.
22:58  abracsi: gnarf: wow that was quick
22:58  gnarf: and in that case, the items DO move position in the DOM
22:58  Cork[home]: ?eval Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
22:58  bot-t: Cork[home]: 5
22:58  abracsi: if you knew how long that took me to do that with raw javascript
22:58  Cork[home]: janthony: ^
22:58  janthony: Cork[home]: So you could almost reword my question to "How can a select a random number that is in a given range?" :P
22:59  abracsi: I wish i'd converted to frameworks earlier.
22:59  Cork[home]: i just gave you the answer :)
22:59 @ajpiano: janthony: use whatever multiplier
22:59 @ajpiano: and his solution
22:59  janthony: Cork[home]/ajpiano: Thanks, I'll try it out!

23:09  randomOfAmber: ajpiano: hmm... it seems the element needs to be drug into another list for that to fire
23:10  randomOfAmber: out is what I was using... but it fires when the element is drug out of the list, and not when I mouseup after dragging it out
