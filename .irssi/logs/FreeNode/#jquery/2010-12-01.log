00:01  DAElectric_: ui.resizeable doesnt seem to have this kind of option
00:02  eTiger13: DAElectric_  [Div 1 100% width  [DIV 2 Resizeable]]
00:03  coldhead: hobs, eTiger13 are you able to do anything about dtelepathy's plugin?
00:04  dtelepathy: I can provide proof of trademark, I essentially need a cease and desist use of term "slidedeck" here: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/slidedeck
00:05  dtelepathy: Our plugin has zero visibility, and the above mentioned plugin hijacks our brand
00:05  dtelepathy: :(
00:06  DAElectric_: eTiger13: like this I need the needstobeadjusted div resized when resizer is adjusted <div style="width:100%"><div class="resizer" style="width:30%">legen here</div><div class="needstobeadjusted" style="width:70%">stuff here</div></div>
00:08  addyosmani: dtelepathy: so..your complaint is that someone is using your brand name in a tag?
00:08  ajpiano: addyosmani, a competing product took the url from his plugin page
00:08  ajpiano: and made it link to their plugin
00:08  addyosmani: ah, I see
00:08  ajpiano: and be a description of their thing
00:08  ajpiano: etc etc

00:12  peekaboo: Wait so can I use jquery with other servers?
00:12  peekaboo: Like IIS or err I forget the name of it
00:12  coldhead: you sure can, peekaboo
00:12  peekaboo: Wow cool
00:13  ajpiano: peekaboo: i swear to god
00:13  coldhead: any server that shoves data into a web browser should work
00:13  DAElectric_: No. you cant use jquery with any servers. you use it with browsers
00:13  ajpiano: DAElectric_ don't waste your keystrokes
00:13  coldhead: YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE, DAElectric_
00:13  DAElectric_: the server just presents the jquery
00:13  peekaboo: coldhead: XHTML you mean?
00:13  peekaboo: or just xml?
00:13  coldhead: i don't care
00:13  coldhead: whatever floats your boats
00:13  peekaboo: Yeah but to present it, it has to know how to handle it

00:17  TheSin: oh thank god there is a jquery irc chan :)
00:17  coldhead: its not a very good one, TheSin
00:17  coldhead: lot of jerks
00:17  coldhead: white supremacists
00:17  t33: is it possible to change background images and colors with css while scrolling a page so that when you scroll the css will change a background image per position?
00:17  TheSin: since I have spent the last 4 hours trying to figure it out, when I use .animate() why does it auto reset scrollTop to 0?
00:17  t33: trying to make a candle burn out as you scroll down the page
00:18  t33: cool idea
00:18 @ajpiano: TheSin, are you clicking on an <a> to trigger the animation
00:18  TheSin: yes
00:18  jjenzz: e.preventDefault()
00:19  TheSin: thanks ajpiano I feel stupid
00:19  TheSin: the page is so simple I didn't even notice the reload ;)
00:20  t33: looking for recommendation and help ^
00:20  TheSin: perfect thanks jjenzz that worked 100%, you guys rock!
00:20  coldhead: t33: i'm not sure what event you would bind to to catch that
00:21  t33: are their any plugins i can use you know of?
00:21  jjenzz: TheSin: np
00:21  t33: theirs gotta be a scroll function though
00:21  t33: i mean that changes something as you scroll
00:21  t33: maybe not with css but i'm sure it's prob possible
00:21  coldhead: t33: i guess you'd have to poll the scroll position with setTimeout and get the offset
00:21  t33: poll?
00:21  coldhead: and burn the candle accordingly
00:21  t33: i'm not familiar with that temr
00:22  DAElectric_: whats the window width again"
00:22  DAElectric_: ?
00:22  t33: well it would ne an image or something
00:22  coldhead: poll as in keep checking for it
00:22  coldhead: every n seconds
00:22  t33: i might use transparency
00:22  t33: to change hte vbrightness
00:22  t33: and make dissapear in the air
00:22  t33: oooo check the position
00:22  t33: hmm no idea where to start any tutorials out htere?
00:23  coldhead: t33: take a look at the source for infinite scroll
00:23  coldhead: ?g jquery infinite scroll
00:23  bot-t: coldhead, Infinite Scroll | jQuery plugin, Wordpress plugin, interaction ... - http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
00:24  coldhead: it detects when its near the bottom of the page
00:24  coldhead: you could borrow that code
00:24  eTiger13: ?get
00:24  bot-t: .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
00:25  Lumpio-: .get is largely useless nowadays
00:25 @ajpiano: lol
00:26  coldhead: ?mlu
00:26  bot-t: much like urself
00:26  Lumpio-: har har
00:26  DAElectric_: so its kinda like first with a parameter
00:27  madebyevident: hi, i just wanted to know, when i call the jQuery('el').sortable('cancel') function, what else is called by jQuery in order to revert the item back to its original position?
00:29  coldhead: i think you'd have to read the source for that, madebyevident
00:30  coldhead: or do some kind of debugger step-through
00:30 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
00:30  devinrolsen: afternoon all
00:30  felixjet: which effects i can aply if i change the src attribute of an image?
00:31  coldhead: felixjet: none
00:31  felixjet: for example, the image is b&w, and i want to animate to the new src, which is full color
00:31  felixjet: none is possible?
00:31  felixjet: no fade or something?
00:31  coldhead: if you want to change images with an effect you have to have two images and do a crossfade or something
00:31  hobs: coldhead: I will try the plugin thing
00:31  felixjet: yea, i want that
00:31  coldhead: but just changing the src is atomic
00:31  hobs: if nothing happened on that, sorry I was afk
00:31  coldhead: it switches straight over
00:31  felixjet: how i can do it then?
00:31  felixjet: i have both images
00:31  coldhead: ?fadetoggle
00:31  bot-t: coldhead, .fadeToggle() - Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/

00:33  coldhead: hobs: the complainant fucked off but you can probably prevent some headaches down the line by fixing it for him anyway
00:34  devinrolsen: single image that animates the opacity to 0, then changes the src and animates the opacity back again
00:34  felixjet: great
00:34  felixjet: thanks devinrolsen
00:34  devinrolsen: np
00:34  hobs: dteyeah let me read into it coldhead
00:37  hobs: alright so it looks like if I just delete that plugin we are good
00:37 --- siculars_ is now known as siculars
00:40  coldhead: do it, hobs
00:40  coldhead: then decommission the plugins site
00:40  hobs: ok ill start loading it
00:40  hobs: haha
00:40  hobs: I printed the source to a file for eTiger13 and it is 152 pages for the source code for one plugin page
00:41  coldhead: your poor browser
00:41  devinrolsen: holy crap
00:41  devinrolsen: was the font size like 22 on that print out?
00:42  eTiger13: 152 pages? how many lines is that?
00:42  coldhead: ALL OF THEM
00:43  snover: hobs: There’s nothing to be done
00:43  snover: hobs: There’s no “hijacking” going on
00:45  snover: hobs: Dude is just incapable of understanding the difference between a plugin tags listing and a project page
00:47  coldhead: i am similarly incapable
00:47  snufft: hi everyone
00:49  coldhead: hi snufft
00:50  Hopsy: hai i have a quick question
00:51  Hopsy: i would like to add the country place through the registration of a member
00:51  Hopsy: should i use this large list? http://snipplr.com/view/4792/country-drop-down-list-for-web-forms/
00:51  Hopsy: witch all the countries
00:51  Hopsy: or do we have an api for this
00:52  losing: When you say API, are you asking if there is a a webservice that offers a list of countries via JSONP request?
00:52  snufft: hi coldhead ^^
00:53  devinrolsen: yeah I am confused by the quesiton as well Hopsy
00:53  eTiger13: Hopsy: if you mean we as in you and me then if you dont then we dont
00:53  losing: Hopsy: if you don't mind your site breaking if a user has javascript disabled, you may want to find one.  Otherwise, I would either generate the select list on the server side or hard code it into the HTML
00:53  losing: hi snufft, hi coldhead
00:54  Hopsy: okay clear
00:55  eTiger13: i say do away with countries and we all can be one united world
00:55  devinrolsen: its kind of an overkill to json a list of countries, I say hard code it
00:56  Hopsy: okay, andd is it possible to find all of the states from the chosen country?
00:56  Hopsy: states=places
00:57  devinrolsen: now you are getting in to a server side need :)
00:58  lvh: There are multiple plugins that let me automatically resize textareas as the input grows
00:58  lvh: Which one should I use?
00:58  Hoe``: (prob wrong channel, but...) i have an ajax result which is returning an error, any idea how i can see it in ie8?
00:58  snufft: hi losing
00:59  devinrolsen: lvh, I like this one
00:59  devinrolsen: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
00:59  DeathRayDragonLu: anyone have a good tutorial on binding all click events to the body and using some sort of element propagation finding to define which element you clicked?
00:59  madebyevident: hi guys when i do a jQuery('item').sortable('cancel') and when the update event is activated, one of my lists doesnt recognise the item, it seems as though its stuck somewhere.
00:59  DeathRayDragonLu: not sure I'm making sense
00:59  lvh: devinrolsen: Okay, thanks :)
00:59  BinaryKitten: DeathRayDragonLu  event.relatedTarget
00:59  Hoe``: DeathRayDragonLu: .live auto-listens to the root element for your selector, if that helps
01:00  DeathRayDragonLu: The idea would be $("body").click(function() {  if(event.relatedTarget ==
01:00  DeathRayDragonLu: etc...  ?
01:00  DeathRayDragonLu: didn't know that about .live
01:00  DeathRayDragonLu: good to know
01:00  DeathRayDragonLu: so it's automagically efficient.
01:00  lvh: devinrolsen: It appears to be for 1.3 -- is there a way to know up front if something still works in 1.4?
01:00  Hoe``: so $(".foo").live("click", function() { }); listens on the root element for click to .foo
01:01  lvh: devinrolsen: If not, is it reasonable to assume it will?
01:01  devinrolsen: yes it works for 1.4
01:01  lvh: Okay, thanks
01:01  DeathRayDragonLu: root == "body" ?
01:01  lvh: devinrolsen: How about in general? Sorry, I'm new to jquery and its plugins
01:01  robertor: hi! everyone...
01:01  Hoe``: i believe so
01:01  DeathRayDragonLu: shweet
01:01  DeathRayDragonLu: had no idea it was built in
01:01  robertor: someone could help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4310563/ready-state-problem-with-ajax-and-jquery
01:01  robertor: ?
01:02  hobs: alright
01:02  hobs: snover: so I will do nothing then?
01:02  hobs: I like the idea of doing nothing
01:03  eTiger13: robertor: what is j?
01:03  RTPMatt_: DeathRayDragonLu: you should check out .delegate as well
01:03  DeathRayDragonLu: I've seen it...I forget the difference, but yesh.
01:04  Hoe``: i feel like i'm being punked, can you really not view requests/results made via ajax in ie8?
01:04  DeathRayDragonLu: I'm basically doing the following: $("a[href]")...

01:04  robertor: ohh this values are counters only eTiger13
01:04  robertor: are not important for the main problem
01:05  Hoe``: snufft: the general way is to use <label for="theIdOfTheRadioButton">your label</label>
01:05  devinrolsen: Hoe,http://www.fiddler2.com/Fiddler2/version.asp
01:05  snover: hobs: yes, nothing is good
01:05  devinrolsen: great tool for reviewing http requests over all browsers
01:06  robertor: the comunication with the server is ok... the response work perfect... but only one time... i have debugged... and i think that the problem is that tab() abort the load of tabs. When i see in firebug... the <ul> only has the class... but in the list there is no modification...
01:06  Hoe``: the other way is .attr("checked", "checked")
01:06  hobs: sounds good
01:06  eTiger13: robertor:  http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/zys3X/
01:06  Hoe``: Thanks, I'll give fiddler a try

01:24  DAElectric_: is there a way to get .width to return a % instead of a px
01:24  aidan: How can I make draggable "live", at the moment it stops working for any elements that were cloned.
01:25  DAElectric_: best to add the draggable after cloning instead of using live. live supports very few event types if memory servers correct
01:26  Hoe``: daelectric: you'll need to use css("width") to get any set percentage, i'd suspect
01:26  Hoe``: if it's not set as a percentage, you'll need to calculate it
01:26  Hoe``: child.width / parent.width
01:30  eTiger13: robertor:  try the js code from this in your match_all.js file http://jsfiddle.net/eTiger13/u75Fn/
01:30  blah2: hey all, my question is in this url : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-flexigrid-javascript-problem
01:30  eTiger13: although i have no idea what the code is doing. seems excessively complicated
01:31  DAElectric_: Hoe``: I am getting inconstent results using width
01:32  robertor: eTiger13, did you change the order in the code and change the direct call of the function and change by live()?
01:33  eTiger13: robertor:  uh sure?
01:34  blah2: eTiger13, can you help me next?
01:36  eTiger13: i charge $5000 an incident
01:37  eTiger13: blah2:  what is g.doSearch() doing?
01:38  blah2: haha, can you do me a pro-bono?
01:38  robertor: eTiger13 it doesn't work
01:40  blah2: etiger13, I actually just found that it is probably a problem with the ajax, seems like that when I switch windows it refreshes properly, looks like the enter key (char 13) does something to the ajax that makes it return the correct values, and without it it returns the old values (for example, if query #1 was 10 rows, query #2 with char 13 returns 5 rows, but without it it still returns the
01:40  blah2: same 10 rows
01:41  Hoe``: are you checking the raw requests to make sure they're going through/returning properly?
01:41  Hoe``: and don't submit a request for ajax on each key press lol
01:43  blah2: hoe, ok, then what would I do instead? I need to search and minimize the list according to the search pattern
01:43  blah2: hoe: raw reqests are fine, I checked with the php script that creates the JSON
01:44  eTiger13: robertor:  you need to look at the tabs .load method
01:44  eTiger13: blah2:  i was thinking that they are getting cached
01:45  blah2: etiger, php script has this : header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate" );
01:46  blah2: from all the debugging I performed (and it was a lot), it seems that the enter key (char 13) makes all the difference
01:47  blah2: the function that receives the json structure gets the old data without the char 13 for some reason
01:47  blah2: like it is only refershed the next time
01:48  Hoe``: blah2: I'd probably make it delayed request the ajax, so once no key has been pressed for 800ms submit the query
01:48  eTiger13: robertor: try changing the .tabs() to .tabs("destroy").tabs() just for fun even if it is dirty code
01:49  Hoe``: blah2: also... he's gone :(
01:49 --- blah2 is now known as blah222
01:49  blah222: hoe: can you give me an example? because even if i set a simple delay it will request the ajax twice (if i press two chars)
01:51  Hoe``: http://pastey.net/143469 that's using a timer plugin, it shows something on delay, but if mouse out occurs, the timer is canceled
01:52  robertor: let me try eTiger13.... but the first, doesnt work
01:52  ajpiano: blah222 http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
01:52  DAElectric_: anyone seen an issue with nested sortables in IE? its going all wonky on me. When you try to move one of the nested items it moves the parent
01:52  Hoe``: so you'd do something like: keydown(function() { $.doTimeout("ajaxdelay"); $.doTimeout("ajaxdelay", 800, function() { d.WhateverItwas(); } })
01:52  Hoe``: that way it cancels the timer then restarts it
01:52  Hoe``: you need the doTimeout plugin
01:53  robertor: eTiger this work!!!
01:53  robertor: let me reply in all...
01:53  shishirmk: I want to make a form like this http://wiki.sahanafoundation.org/lib/exe/fetch.php/foundation:gsoc_kohli:import:resolve_duplicates.jpg can any one tell me what i should use for this in jQuery?
01:53  syncopated: can anyone point to some live-site examples of jqGrid in action? thank you very much
01:54  blah222: hoe, testing both solutions
01:54  robertor: eTiger13... !!! perfect! thanks a lot for the hint!!!
01:54  Hoe``: they'll both work pretty good for you
01:54  Hoe``: i think 800ms is a good delay, fyi/imho
01:55  ajpiano: 250 is usally enough for "stopped typing"
01:56  Hoe``: i'd agree if it was generating something client side, but it might end up being funky for a slow typist when it results in an ajax request
01:57  Hoe``: i bet he'll use 525 and neither of us will win :(
01:57  ajpiano: you have to be an epically slow typist
01:57  eTiger13: robertor:  i accept donations
01:57  ajpiano: if it takes you a second in between keystrokes
01:58  ajpiano: and if you are that slow
01:58  ajpiano: then you probably want ajax suggestions sooner rather than later
01:58  ajpiano: :p
01:59  Hoe``: lol
02:00  robertor: really eTiger13?
02:00  robertor: :-D
02:00  eTiger13: yup
02:00  robertor: do you have a blog or something?
02:01  DAElectric_: Can someone please take a look at this and tell me if it is a bug or just something that I am doing wrong http://jsfiddle.net/kNQxB/11/
02:01  Snerf: is it possible to run a function after you changed a .attr()?  .attr().load perpahs?
02:02  Hoe``: snerf: .attr isn't asynce
02:02  Hoe``: so .attr(); alert("it's been changed by this point");
02:02  blah222: i'll try and see what works ;-)
02:02  Hoe``: any luck yet blah?
02:02  blah222: btw, older people type slower, my father can have 2 seconds delay between letters .. ;)
02:02  Hoe``: maybe using the delay, one way or another, will fix the odd problem :)
02:03  blah222: just got back from restroom, now startig to check
02:03  Snerf: Hoe``, thanks
02:03  DAElectric_: as you got old with bad eyesite your head is too close to the keyboard to hunt and peek effectively
02:04  eTiger13: robertor: i do but it sucks. eddiemonge.com
02:05  eTiger13: DAElectric_:  why are you connecting .subUL with itself?
02:06  DAElectric_: eTiger: to allow dragging of children to the different parents

02:07  DAElectric_: eTiger: regardless of what its linked to it stills has the same dragging issue.
02:08  DAElectric_: eTiger: notice here that it is commented out and is still broken in IE  http://jsfiddle.net/DAElectric/kNQxB/14/

02:11  DAElectric_: eTiger: oh and I got laid off today
02:12  eTiger13: DAElectric_:  that sucks. then why are you still supporting it?
02:13  DAElectric_: eTiger: I'm not now I am try to compet kinda. I am building a new front end based on thier com obs and dlls that will work cross broswer
02:13  blah222: .keydown( $.debounce (250, g.doSearch ) );
02:13  blah222: doesn't seem to run at all

02:14  torch_: hi guys .. just new to jquery thing ...
02:15  torch_: need some help when trying to use forms inside a jquery plugin (cluetip)
02:15  torch_: anyone?
02:16  blah222: err, stupid me, i thought it was a part of jquery
02:16  DAElectric_: torch: what prob are you having?
02:16  eTiger13: ?ask @ torch_
02:16  bot-t: torch_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
02:18  torch_: ok .. I have: $(document).ready(function() { $('area.tips1').cluetip({ attribute: 'rel', titleAttribute: 'title', local: true, hideLocal: true, arrows: true, dropShadow: true, hoverIntent: true, sticky: true, mouseOutClose: false, closePosition: 'bottom', closeText: 'close'}); });
02:19  torch_: and <area class="tips1" shape="rect" rel=".risk" alt="Risk" title="Risk" coords="0,269,67,329" />
02:19  blah222: etiger, could it be that the function doesn't recgonize the callback function g.doSearch() because it is not in it scope?
02:20  torch_: and <div class="risk"> the risk is bla bla bla <br> <input type="radio" name="risk" value="yes">Yes  <input type="radio" name="risk" value="no">No  <input type="radio" name="risk" value="some">some </div>
02:21  torch_: so .. my question is ... when the tip comes out I can see everything just fine ... but when I click Yes, No or Some ... the value seems to disappear
02:21  torch_: what am I doing wrong?
02:22 --- gothm0g is now known as balr0g
02:22  robertor: what is the difference between do this: $("#previous_left").live('click', previous_left);   instead this  $("#previous_left").click(function(){previous_left()});
02:23  alcuadrado: robertor, the first one attaches the event handler to #previous_left, the second to one of its ancestors and delegates the event
02:23  DAElectric_: $("#previous_left").live('click', previous_left); any new elements with the id of previous_left add to the html will get the click even add to it
02:25  blah222: anyone? if I want to call a function inside the jquery scope, $.g.doSearch() doesn't work..?
02:26  robertor: ohh i see
02:26  robertor: thanks a lot!
02:27  eTiger13: blah222:  can you paste it at jsfiddle?

02:33  lukemh: Hello all. Im looking for a solution to the following problem: i am using .html() to grab an div, which is working fine. But i would like to pass a string to replace within that div. http://pastebin.com/ZLF9mabv
02:34  blah222: $ is extended with var g = .... .doSarch = function {} ...
02:35  blah222: trying to call g from outside, tried $.g.doSearch(), $('g').doSearch, doesn't work ?
02:36  eTiger13: lukemh:  what do you mean?
02:37  lukemh: I think i have a solution.
02:37  eTiger13: torch_: what are you asking?
02:37  lukemh: brb
02:39  torch_: hi etiger13 ... the thing is .. I'm using cluetip to make tooltip for a image (usemap) ...when the tip pops up inside of it I have some forms and when checking one of the radiobuttons I simple cant get it ..
02:40  lukemh: i got mine working... i just replaced the text before the html() call
02:41  eTiger13: torch_: you are putting a form in a tooltip?
02:41  torch_: that's right eTiger
02:44  blah222: anyone? i'm going to kick something soon
02:45  DAElectric_: $.fn.g?
02:45  DAElectric_: had to do that to make  sure that a lazy load javascript was done
02:46  torch_: eTiger13 .. can I pm u?

02:47  jquery: test my word
02:47  jquery: somebody tell okay?
02:49  torch_: eTiger13: hmmm I'll take a look at it .. but I'm not sure
02:49  blah222: daelectric, doesn't work..
02:50  torch_: eTiger13: the thing is ... inside of the dialog ... I'll ask some questions .. and I need to get all the answers .. that's why I'm trying to use forms inside of it
02:52  DAElectric_: a modal dialog might work better from the users perspective.   $(".hoverItem").hover(function(){ $(".divThatContainsForm").dialog({modal: true});  }}

03:52  Woosta: How can I get a collection of the last td in every tr of a table?  $('#table_id tr td:last') only selects the last TD in the last TR

03:53  OhaiBBQ: ;_;

03:53  ajpiano: :p
03:53  nirvdrum: ajpiano: Thanks.
03:54  OhaiBBQ: lol, do people on other channels call you piano?
03:54  Woosta: ajpiano: thanks .. works great
03:54  ajpiano: no, no one does
03:54  ajpiano: but people sometimes talk about the instrument
03:54  nirvdrum: I thought it was something built in on tabs that I was just missing.  The docs on the ajax stuff there seem a bit outdated.

04:02  eTiger13: i see what you are talking about on the plugin site
04:03  hobs: yeah
04:03  hobs: I mean I am also just afraid of the load I am putting on the server each time too :(
04:04  ajpiano: Woosta, call .prev() on the entire seelction
04:04  eTiger13: yeah the load is about 12% cpu for each request on that. im looking at the drupal plugin to see how it can be modified
04:04  hobs: sorry :()
04:04  Woosta: ajpiano: nice :-D
04:04  janthony: If I want to fade something in and then fade it out, I guess I would animate for that? Or just use animate with opacity?

04:10  hobs: :0
04:10  eTiger13: unless i was logged into my account and not the user one, hold on let me double check
04:10  hobs: oh maybe it is just logged out
04:10  hobs: yeah double check
04:10  hobs: because I thought that was what I isolated
04:11  hobs: maybe I was wrong, its an occurence im familiar with
04:11  eTiger13: this is hard without a mouse

04:19  joshwins: kinda like labs.js?
04:19  ajpiano: i dont know what that is
04:19  joshwins: or require.js?
04:19  joshwins: ok
04:19  ajpiano: headjs seems like ... an ok loader coupled with an ok feature detection library
04:19  ajpiano: yeah exactly
04:19  ajpiano: lab.js, not labs
04:19  ajpiano: i was like, wtf.
04:19  ajpiano: i don't know why you wouldn't just use require and modernizr
04:19  joshwins: sorry *lab :)
04:20  erichynds: there's nothing in head.js worth using that isn't already in require or modernizr
04:20  erichynds: imo
04:20  joshwins: true. guess its new, so might just have a play and see
04:22  alcuadrado: great, finally I find people that make a good critic of head.js hehe, I don't undestand why it got soo much attention today
04:23  joshwins: new kid on the block?
04:23  ajpiano: alcuadrado: cause the internet buzzes about new things

04:24  alcuadrado: and hackernews
04:24  alcuadrado: and many blogs, even from here, argentina
04:24  nirvdrum: ajpiano: Perhaps a silly question, but with that bbq tabs code, is it possible to customize the hash name?  Or do I need to use the more general, non-tabs variant?
04:24  ajpiano: you can put any naming convention you want in bbq, i know that much

08:08  paul_irish: :)
08:08  paul_irish: hmmm i think you want more control than that.
08:08  paul_irish: some throttling.

08:10  Arimil: Hi guys, I'm trying to remove some elements from a page using jquery. I got it to work however the table I removed is given a border using css.
08:10  letterpress: interesting. thanks...
08:10  Arimil: I tried $('a[href="http://www.site.com/forums/awcl_cpsl.php?do=list"]').parent().attr('class', '');
08:10  Arimil: to remove the class and thought that would remove the border
08:10  Arimil: but it did not
08:11  Arimil: any ideas?
08:14  letterpress: paul_irish: cool. any thoughts about this plugin, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ , for the task?
08:15  doonie: moin
08:16  paul_irish: hey doonie
08:16  doonie: hai paulsie
08:16  doonie: back home yet?
08:16  paul_irish: letterpress: actually throttle is the wrong word
08:16  paul_irish: you want chunked processing
08:17  paul_irish: both throttling and debouncing throw away items
08:17  paul_irish: which you don't want to do
08:17  paul_irish: zakas's code is basically what you want but up that timeout to something much higher
08:17  paul_irish: also.... you COULD potentially use my imagesLoaded plugin
08:18  Arimil:   $('a[href="http://www.site.com/forums/awcl_cpsl.php?do=list"]').parent().attr('style', 'border: 0px;'); doesn't seem to work either *sigh*
08:18  letterpress: ...which i already am using on the site, even.
08:18  letterpress: but the problem is that the .load() event won't fire until 10+ seconds
08:18  letterpress: oh wait i see
08:19  letterpress: or not. how would i use the imagesLoaded plugin?
08:21  Arimil: nor does $('a[href="http://sitecom/file.php"]').parent().css('border', '0px');
08:22  ajpiano: Arimil are you even sure you're selecting the right element
08:22  Arimil: Yes, I am using the same selector to remove it's contents.
08:22  letterpress: i'll try to get the chunk on in the morning, thanks paul
08:22  Arimil: It's contents get removed but the border remains
08:22  ajpiano: are you sure it's not the css outline proprty you're seeing, not border?
08:23  Arimil: Hm, <table class="tborder" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="1" border="0" width="100%" align="center">
08:25  paul_irish: letterpress: i guess you'd wait till all images in a chunk have loaded and then set up the rest
08:25  paul_irish: to do so
08:25  Arimil: .tborder{background: #333333;	color: #CCCCCC;	border: 1px solid #333333;}
08:25  paul_irish: but then i suppose you wouldnt be using zakas's chunking :)
08:25  ajpiano: Arimil, all i'm saying is, is this you asking for help, or debugging out loud
08:25  Arimil: I'm asking if anyone knows any other way that I could remove it. :p
08:25  letterpress: ok thanks again, i'll try to get the chunk working first. i did all the development on chrome and then realized...the rest of the world isn't this fast :(
08:25  ajpiano: we barely have any idea what' happening
08:25  Arimil: I'll type something up
08:26  LearnerJq: ajpiano:do u remember my problem yesterday?i have resolved it...want to share ...clarify my concept further
08:27  ajpiano: i remember that you had a problem
08:27  ajpiano: and that's about it
08:28  doonie: :))
08:28  ajpiano: jog my memory...
08:28  doonie: he's still playing in explorer don't mind him ;P
08:28  LearnerJq: i was getting more than once dialogs via Jquery live() method because i was replacing the dialog link via ajax..and DOM would  consider it more than one...thus i had to use .remove() method each time i would replace the dialog link so that initial one is completely wiped out
08:29  ajpiano: yea
08:30  ajpiano: that's basically what i told you was happening
08:30  Arimil: ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/zTCqL/
08:30  Arimil: is what I mean :p
08:30  Arimil: border remains
08:30  LearnerJq: so now just for clarification purpose..i just want to know that if an element of a particular class say class="foo" is replaced via another class="foo" via ajax..and the .html()..so the DOM actually thinks to have 2 elements of Class="foo" or one?
08:32  ajpiano: Arimil, 1999 called, it wants its markup back.
08:32  Arimil: xD
08:32  Arimil: not my site
08:32  doonie: that's what she said
08:32  Arimil: tell that to the noobs that run my website and won't let me edit it
08:32  doonie: be a man and take control ;p
08:33  Arimil: well, it's not really my website
08:33  Arimil: it's my guilds website
08:33  Arimil: and I'm constantly changing it because I find it highly unuseable
08:33  ajpiano: a) that's the nerdiest thing i've ever heard
08:33  Arimil: greasemonkey win xD
08:33  ajpiano: b) not really
08:33  doonie: ;D
08:33  ajpiano: c) use border 0 not 0px
08:33  ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/zTCqL/2/

08:34  Arimil: didn't know about that

08:39  ajpiano: oh shiiiii
08:39  MaxTJM: god I suck at math, someone plz help,  1=12  2=70  3 =154  I need a solution to provied 2.5=125
08:40  MaxTJM: I'm getting my css figured out
08:40  doonie: that is not an equation
08:40  crescendo: wat
08:40  alcuadrado: what's that MaxTJM ? :S
08:40  doonie: 2,5=125 is an answer ;P
08:40  beastman: im having a hard time seeing why my code is not functioning when hovered over a certian div, but consistently runs when on background
08:43  doonie: I shot the sheriff
08:43  MaxTJM: basically, 1 to 2 is an increase of 58, and from 2 - 3 is an increase of 84 for a total of 1 - 3 = 142   somehow I need to come up with a solution like x * y * 1 = 12  x * y * 2 = 70...
08:44  doonie: oh you want to figure out the formula based on 2-3 results ;p
08:44  MaxTJM: or divided by, whatever, I really suck at math but i need to figure out 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... all the way to 3 and I know what 1, 2, 2.5, and 3 are
08:44  MaxTJM: exactly donnie
08:45  MaxTJM: and my math skills are non-existant
08:45  doonie: 1=12, 2=70 should be enough to build an equation
08:45  doonie: err no you need 3 heh
08:45  doonie: ya i can't help with this, maybe 7y ago ;D
08:46  doonie: x=12, 2x=70, 3x=154
08:46  MaxTJM: lol, see, I would definitly not know that, its ok doonie, I'll find a math geek somewhere, I've asked on a few fourms already, this was my last resort
08:46  doonie: try #math ;D
08:46  MaxTJM: lol, ok
08:47  alcuadrado: MaxTJM, if doonies system is right
08:47  beastman: need a genius, http://www.opennatal.com, having trouble fixing when cursor is inside the div
08:47  doonie: 1x=12, 2x=70, 3x=154
08:47  alcuadrado: that has no solution :)
08:47  doonie: not x=12
08:47  doonie: still it can be 1+x or god know what ;D long time i did that
08:47  doonie: think we need more variables
08:48  doonie: like cracking a hash table
08:48  doonie: only way is to brute :)
08:49  doonie: god I don't miss school ;D
08:50  alcuadrado: maths is not that bad
08:50  alcuadrado: the only problem is math teachers trying to teach CS :(
08:50  doonie: cs?
08:50  alcuadrado: counter strike
08:50  alcuadrado: hehe, computer sciencces
08:51  doonie: ;> ya that used to be worse 10y ago
08:52  doonie: when all students knew more than the teacher, nw the generation is somewhat diff. so the teach has a chance
08:52  alcuadrado: mathematicians knows A LOT about it, but they are just boring hehe
08:54  beastman: .mousemove not firing when hovered over object tag
08:56  phrearch: hey
08:56  phrearch: does anyone know if an editable div can have the same events as a textarea?
08:56  beastman: im sorry, mousemove not working in iframe tag
08:56  Cork: phrearch: you mean like keyup?
08:57  Cork: or what?
08:57  phrearch: Cork: yea, and for carrot location stuff
08:57  Cork: phrearch: yes it can
08:57  phrearch: Cork: ok great. ill have to start experimenting with it soon then
08:58  phrearch: working on a collab texteditor. would be nice if other users' input can have a different colour while they type
08:59  alcuadrado: that's completly possible =)
08:59  alcuadrado: titanpad does that
09:10  MaxTJM: um, I know I suck, sorry, can't help it and people at math f'n hate me/everyone, so here, a visual example of what I'm doing, I need to place the twitter img directly in the bottom middle of the poster regardless of the size, currently size is  (size * 2) * 17.5  but that isn't working, here http://visoogle.com/test.html   use the jquery ui slider at the bottom left to see what I  I'm talking about
09:15  alcuadrado: I see
09:15  alcuadrado: you suck at maths man hehe
09:15  alcuadrado: you should do this
09:15  ajpiano: good fucking god man
09:16  ajpiano: that CssSize function is one of the ... sheesh
09:16  ajpiano: it's not maths that's the problem
09:16  ajpiano: the entire approach
09:16  ajpiano: is like
09:16  alcuadrado: twitter_button_left_margin_from_image_left_side = (image_width - twitter_button_width) / 2
09:16  ajpiano: nonsensical
09:17  sean`: wow
09:17  sean`: nice var names
09:17  sean`: should make them camelcase for more readability

09:17  alcuadrado: haha, it's just pseudocode, I hope MaxTJM would change them =)
09:18  NoOova: hi all! why html(param) dont attach to the queue?
09:18  MaxTJM: lol, hmm... thanks alcuadrado, I'll check it out, I'm very hopeful
09:18  Cork: NoOova: only animations attach ot the queue
09:18  NoOova: to = $(to);     to.fadeOut(300);     to.html(html);     to.fadeIn(300);
09:18  NoOova: but how i can attach it?
09:18  alcuadrado: us a callback
09:18  alcuadrado: use*
09:19  NoOova: how? i cant transmit params to function
09:19  alcuadrado: to.fadeout(300, function() { to.html(html); });
09:19  NoOova: khm... 1 se
09:19  alcuadrado: it's a clojure
09:19  alcuadrado: so it can access to it's parent scope variables directly
09:20  Cork: alcuadrado: no (function() {}); is a closure, func(function() {}); is a callback
09:20  ajpiano: MaxTJM, is this generated code
09:20  MaxTJM: generated?
09:20  ajpiano: like, did you write every line of this by hand
09:20  ajpiano: or is php or something generating it
09:20  MaxTJM: dynamic?
09:20  NoOova: alcuadrado: thanx))) i tryed without a function(){ ***}
09:20  Cork: opps * (function() {})(); is a
09:21  MaxTJM: oh, jquery
09:21  alcuadrado: Cork, isn't it a closure passed as argument?
09:21  ajpiano: MaxTJM
09:21  ajpiano: what
09:21  MaxTJM: ajpiano, jquery
09:21  ajpiano: jquery did not generate this code
09:21  Cork: alcuadrado: no its a function passed as an argument
09:21  MaxTJM: all of it
09:21  Cork: alcuadrado: an anonymus function
09:21  ajpiano: so you wrote every single line of this yourself
09:21  MaxTJM: yes
09:21  MaxTJM: I'm hiding the real goodies
09:22  ajpiano: this is so far from the right way to code javascript
09:22  ajpiano: it's insane
09:22  MaxTJM: thats ok
09:22  ajpiano: it really isn't
09:22  MaxTJM: I don't know the right way, but my way works, you'll see, and i can easily get it lint approved
09:22  beepbeep_: now I'm curious
09:22  beepbeep_: where can I see this codez!
09:23  ajpiano: http://visoogle.com/_js/Footer.js
09:23  ajpiano: MaxTJM, this might be the stupidest way of sizing elements on a page dynamically that i have ever seen a human being come up with
09:23  MaxTJM: lol, possibly
09:24  beepbeep_: ajpiano, ever heard of constructive feedback?
09:24  beepbeep_: :p
09:24  ajpiano: beepbeep_, yeah
09:24  ajpiano: i give it all day long
09:24  ajpiano: but sometimes
09:25  MaxTJM: yeah, seriously, I don't know whats wrong with it and I definitly don't know another way to do what I'm doing
09:25  alcuadrado: cork, I might be wrong, but AFAIK a closure is a function with variables bounded to the ones from the lexical scope it was defined, doesn't matter if it is self invoking or not
09:25  ajpiano: a man simply cannot get his jaw off the floor
09:25  beepbeep_: so don't talk with your jaw hanging on the floor
09:25  beepbeep_: ;)
09:25  beepbeep_: :D
09:25  Cork: alcuadrado: yes, but your not passing a scope, you passing a pointer to a function (or a function if you prefer)
09:26  ajpiano: well
09:26  ajpiano: in short
09:26  ajpiano: i'd say
09:26  alcuadrado: I can't see the difference :(
09:26  Cork: alcuadrado: when you create a function it creates a scope, and inherits the parent scope, that does not mean that the function you pass it to get access to those variables
09:26  ajpiano: you know you can use CSS for positioning and sizing things dynamically
09:27  Cork: alcuadrado: so your not passing a scope, only a function
09:27  ajpiano: hardcoding a bunch of like, multiplication values into a bunch of uncached nonperformant dom selectors
09:27  MaxTJM: hey, real quick ajpiano, if it works, what could happen? I mean, if I take up a little more processing time than nessary or I don't have good looking code, but my site works, and I know how to make changes... idk, I don't see a problem
09:27  ajpiano: is just a recipe for terrible
09:27  MaxTJM: how do you put variables in css?
09:27  beepbeep_: but isn't it click & drag stuff?
09:27  MaxTJM: I'd love to
09:27  ajpiano: percentage sizing??
09:28  ajpiano: MaxTJM: the whole thing you're trying to do with this slider
09:28  ajpiano: is built into the browse
09:28  ajpiano: press cmd-+
09:28  ajpiano: cmd - -
09:28  MaxTJM: right, I know, but the user dosn't know that for the most part
09:28  ajpiano: so put a footnote telling them how to do it
09:28  MaxTJM: and there is no function to call this effect
09:29  MaxTJM: that would be the easy route, but I want my site to be so user friendly that my grandpa can use it
09:29  ajpiano: just out of curiousity, how old are you
09:30  MaxTJM: 22, just got out of the navy and I'm trying to get something started
09:30  alcuadrado: I undestand that, but still not seeing your point Cork. when I create an anonimous function that uses variables from the lexical scope it is defined, isn't it, by definition, a closure? I'm now confussed
09:30  ajpiano: aha
09:30  Cork: alcuadrado: ya, but if you could pass the scope to a function, that mean the function chould access the scope, thats not true
09:30  ajpiano: MaxTJM well
09:30  ajpiano: i commend your service
09:30  ajpiano: :)
09:30  ajpiano: and
09:31  ajpiano: reccomend that you do some learning about like, programming
09:31  Cork: alcuadrado: you can never pass a scope, you can return a variable from the scope from the function, thats it
09:31  alcuadrado: sure, luckly it's not true. but why does it remove it's closure "title"?
09:32  ajpiano: cause if you stick with this web thing for awhile, you'll end up learning quite a bit, and one day you'll be able to look back on this code and wonder what the hell you were smoking when you came up with it
09:32  MaxTJM: thanks, and I will but first I need a few million... remember the name, Max Meents, 6 months from now, millionare, 2 years, billionare

09:33  MaxTJM: not you to beepbeep, I like sliders, I'll give the user the ability to make it disappear but for those that want it, it'll be there
09:33  ajpiano: people aren't gonna come to your website and be like
09:33  temp01: aknagi: use the visual events tool above. or you can use chrome/webkit and see attached event handlers in the elements panel

09:34  MaxTJM: lol, sounds good, me too
09:34  alcuadrado: cork: oh, I think the confusion is that I was calling closure to the function itself, and you to the closed scope, right?
09:36  ajpiano: MaxTJM
09:36  ajpiano: i just figured it out

09:50  MaxTJM: yay!!!!!!!!!!!!
09:50  lonimurar: temp01: so not having any scripts in the head would be reommended, yea?
09:51  temp01: lonimurar: browsers usually wait for scripts to load and run before continuing with the rest of the page
09:51  JRGould: lonimurar: if you can help it - you want to avoid loading anything that blocks until after your html loads to give the appearance of a faster pageload
09:51  temp01: lonimurar: so putting them at end makes the page loading look faster
09:52  JRGould: woot
09:52  temp01: lonimurar: but most browsers now support defer attribute too so you could use that if you want
09:52  ajpiano: temp01, who cares if it's just a little bit slower, though really, if it works?
09:52  ajpiano: the website is going to be awesome
09:52  JRGould: I agree, people won't care if the next google is a bit slower
09:52  lonimurar: temp01: I don't have any problems putting my scripts at the bottom of the body (I think), I just always thought it's better to have them in the head instead of the body
09:52  JRGould: because it will be the next google
09:53  JRGould: you should probably just call it that
09:53  ajpiano: lonimurar, it's one of those things that has changed in the last few years
09:53  temp01: ?ajpiano fast pages
09:53  bot-t: ajpiano wants to make fast pages come
09:53  ajpiano: it used to be best practise to put them in the head
09:53  lonimurar: the only thing I need to do before any content loads is add a .js class and I guess I'll just do that with plain javascript
09:53  ajpiano: but now it is not

09:54  lonimurar: (add the class to <html>, that is)
09:54  JRGould: lonimurar: write your html and class the html or the body .nojs
09:55  JRGould: and then remove it with your js

09:56  sean`: graceful degradation vs progressive enhancement, has no meaning
09:56  trollboy: using jqgrid and gridComplete... I see how gridcomplete is looping through the table... but how do I loop through the result... I want to pass a RecordID and RecordName to an input.
09:56  lonimurar: what's the difference?
09:57  JRGould: hah - well if we're going to get into that argument - words have no meaning
09:57  sean`: lonimurar, former is 'if it misses, do this', latter is 'if it has, do this'
09:57  JRGould: do you design for the few users that don't have javascript and then progressively enhance for those who do, or do you design for those who do have js and gracefully degrade for those who don't
09:58  sean`: JRGould, that sentence has no meaning, I'm not interested in the what's better
09:58  sean`: There is no point in saying .. vs ..
09:58  JRGould: it's a perspective
09:58  JRGould: that guides your development process
09:58  lonimurar: so I guess which is better is a matter of dispute?
09:58  JRGould: i don't know that there is a better
09:58  sean`: lonimurar, personal preference usually decides
09:58  JRGould: it's just understanding what you are doing on your project
09:58  sean`: I prefer to say fuck it and don't care
09:59  phrearch: ehm, is it possible to disable a link's click event and add another behaviour to it instead?
09:59  sean`: phrearch, yeah

10:02  MaxTJM: '+((76 - 55)*.5) + 22 +'  anyone see a problem with that? trying to add (result) + 22  and it totally goes crazy, if I take away + 22, it works fine... is my syntax ok?
10:02  sean`: JRGould, I met him, not true :p
10:02  sean`: Well.. there was beer

10:03  jastor: MaxTJM: add another ()
10:03  MaxTJM: hi sean, thanks jastor
10:03  phrearch: hm do i need a delegate for future elements?
10:03  sean`: phrearch, to bind events to them, yes
10:04  phrearch: sean`: ok, is there some reason to still use .live by the way?
10:04  trollboy: Anyone see my jqgrid issue?
10:04  sean`: phrearch, they're the same
10:04  JRGould: phrearch: use live if you don't know the scope of those elements
10:04  phrearch: aha, good to know
10:05  JRGould: live is like$(body).delegate()
10:05  JRGould: or window?
10:05  JRGould: someone correct me
10:05  ajpiano: document
10:05  JRGould: pwn3d
10:05  phrearch: hm, i use delegate in the same way
10:05  phrearch: $("body").delegate("button", "click", function(event){
10:06  JRGould: if you can get more specific you should
10:06  lonimurar: temp01: if I just follow the advice from that paul irish blog post, I'll basically be fine?
10:06  JRGould: because now there's overhead every time you click within the body
10:06  phrearch: i guess narrowing the selector scope on a delegate/live will improve lookup times?
10:08  MaxTJM: OMG F'N GOD, thank you alcuadrado, final solution, thanks in large part to you is, left:''+((((76 * size) - (55 * size))*(.5 * size)) + (22 * size)) +'px'
10:10  doonie: lol at eq ;D
10:10  doonie: would never get to that heh
10:10  JRGould: phrearch: yeah - if you delegate a click from the body or use live that basically means that every time there is a click anywhere on the page that click event has to be tested to see if it matches your selector - which I imagine has a bit of overhead that you'd like to avoid
10:10  ajpiano: MaxTJM, so , when this websit egoes live, who is going to be manually coding in the proportions for zooming every image
10:10  MaxTJM: no one, everything is database driven and completly dynamic
10:11  phrearch: JRGould: im using a delegate now to route buttons to a js function based on their classname. not sure if it can be made faster
10:11  shishirmk: how do you select second element in a form in jquery?
10:11  ajpiano: and by completley dynamic, you mean you're hardcoding intricate proporrtional sizing calculations into your javascript
10:11  phrearch: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/298396/
10:11  JRGould: timthumb()!
10:12  MaxTJM: trust me, the world will love it and so will you, just 3 or 4 more months mostly due to internet speed
10:12  phrearch: its quite dirty code
10:12  ajpiano: MaxTJM: please do come back when that has happened
10:12  ajpiano: i will eat a shoe
10:12  ajpiano: you can pick the brand
10:12  MaxTJM: omg, will you post it on youtube... just one whole bit
10:12  MaxTJM: bite
10:12  ajpiano: i will literally eat a shoe
10:12  ajpiano: bit
10:13  ajpiano: one little bite
10:13  JRGould: phrearch if you aredynamically generating a lot of buttons in random containers then that makes sense
10:13  JRGould: it's really just me being picky
10:13  JRGould: but I'm picky
10:13  MaxTJM: HEY EVERYONE, TAKE NOTE. ajpiano is goign to eat a shoe, and I'm going to hold him to it, if the site is dynamic, easily updated and no hardcoding
10:13  phrearch: well, thats good for performance sake :)

10:14  JRGould: you could literally save milliseconds, phrearch!
10:14  lonimurar: temp01: you there?
10:14  temp01: no
10:15  phrearch: JRGould: talking about performance, how about using css animations vs. jquery animations?

11:02  JKarsrud: change isn't triggered by all controls, if I recall correctly
11:03  sasori: argghh..i don't understand the doc of .each(function) ...the sample creates/has an array on it's own...my objective is select a specific value from the existing dropdown menu and show a dom element :S
11:03  bnb_dev: JKarsrud: i want to use ajax call on the select box, so i use change here, is there any other way to get the value of select?

12:12  liviu_: hi
12:13  liviu_: i would like to get the "value" of every input element in my form and store it in an array when page loads
12:13  liviu_: how can i do that so that i can later retrieve the value of the input element by it's key(id) ?
12:14  ajpiano: you can use $.fn.map to make an array
12:14  ajpiano: but that is a bad way to do it
12:14  ajpiano: you can use jQuery's .data()
12:14  ajpiano: to store the original value , associated with each element
12:14  liviu_: ok ajpiano , i will check it out
12:14  liviu_: thanks
12:15  ajpiano: $("input").each(function() {  var $t = $(this); $t.data("originalValue",$t.val());  });
12:15  ajpiano: and then you can just do $(elm).data("originalValue")
12:15  ajpiano: and you'll get it back
12:15  liviu_: oh, that's great
12:16  ajpiano: :)
12:16  liviu_: but one more question

12:57  Cork: sorry i'm mixed up >_<'

13:00  perty: $.get('b.html', function(data) { var x = $(data); alert(data); }); gives me all the HTML returned. what i need is to be able to access this HTML as i would the current document, like i'd go $(data #someid).html("xyz");
13:00  perty: er
13:01  perty: without the var x bit
13:01  perty: the example you wrote makes x and object, and if i do x.html() it's just null
13:03  bot-t: perty, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).

13:04  perty: basically what i'm trying to do is a $.ajax with a beforeSend callback to modify the language header, and i need to access a specific part of the return data and apply it to a specific div
13:04  perty: i'd just use .load but it doesn't do beforeSend

13:58  RTPMatt: kaseano: if any of those inline tags try to call something inside of $.ready, it will not work.  instead, in the $.ready you should be using $(element).click(function(e){...});
13:58  kaseano: ya I didn't know it wasn't possible to do the onClicks anymore, in this case I'm not using any tho
13:58  RTPMatt: sac: are the all bound to the same thing?  but you only want some of them to happen?  or are they bound to different things?
13:59  sac: no not the same thing
13:59  sac: many different things and different kind of elements
13:59  RTPMatt: kaseano: not using onClick allows you to seperate you code from your markup which is a good thing
14:00  kaseano: ya no I really love how jquery does that
14:00  RTPMatt: sac: so you just have a bunch of events, but sometimes you want them "turned on" and somethimes "turned off"?
14:00  sac: yup
14:01 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 219 seconds
14:01  sac: well, more exactly i just want to disable click events for a while
14:02  sac: there could be other solutions as well, my specific problem is that if i mousedown, then move the mouse, and mouseup, if there is the same element under mouse at about same position relative to the pointer, a click is fired
14:02  RTPMatt: sac: you bind/unbind is i suppose the "normal" way to do that, but you could do something like have a variable that you check at the top of your click handler and if it is set to false, just don't run it
14:02  sac: yeah that's not possible :\ i have too many different kinds of handlers
14:02  sac: can't modify them all for this
14:02  RTPMatt: sac: I belive your problem is that you are not using event.stopPropagation();
14:03  sac: i am :\
14:03  sac: i'm doing $(document).bind('click', preventClick); and there i have e.stopPropagation();
14:03  RTPMatt: sac: you should make your click handlers $(...).click(function(event){event.preventDefault(); ...);
14:05  RTPMatt: in the preventClick you have event.stopPropagation();?
14:05  sac: yeah, my preventClick is function preventClick(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }
14:05  sac: and e.preventDefault() there as well
14:05  sac: i'll see in what order the events trigger
14:05  RTPMatt: doing: $(document).bind('click', preventClick); will prevent clicks on the document itself to not bubble, it will not stop ALL clicks from bubbling.  and actually bubbling stops at the document, so reayy that will do nothing
14:05  sac: i'll have to think of something
14:05  sac: thanks
14:06  RTPMatt: events trigger first on the element you click, then bubble up through every parent element till they hit the documtn

Rather than using the same term for the other 'w's, who, when, where, and why, it makes more sense to actually state the word and follow it with 'tf' Capitalization doesn't really matter. This term can also be likened to 'What the shit?' which is more comical and has a tantamount meaning.

15:03  quicksilver: gambo: there are DOMChanged events but browser support for them is very poor
15:03  gambo: nice
15:03  quicksilver: gambo: (you can google for more details)
15:03  gambo: it has to run on the latest browsers
15:03  erichynds: it's not well supported and has actually been deprecated

15:04  RTPMatt_: gambo: what is your goal?  perhaps there is a better solution for what you are trying to do?
15:04  gambo: they should behave like jqueryui buttons
15:04  gambo: but I've build my own once
15:06  gambo: I've a select which is hidden and a span which is created and a div which wraps all this
15:06  gambo: this must happen, when the element appears
15:06  gambo: i don't want to have it in my ajax routine

15:06  erichynds: putting in there is the best way
15:06  gambo: DOMChanged is nice i guess
15:07  RTPMatt_: gambo: if you do not like the idea of putting it in your ajax callback, you might want to check out pub/sub

15:09  erichynds: matej, why not just do $().each() ?
15:10  erichynds: also, i assume a datepicker widget has already been created on these elements?
15:12  matej: erichynds sorry for that each() I was new to jQuery when creating that code :) Yes, datepicker is created on the elements by the time the function runs
15:12  RTPMatt_: gambo: yeah, that's it, basically you could in you ajax callback publish a "hey fix your buttons" and then have a subscriber of that that will fix all of the buttons for you, if there is no subscriber.  If there is no subscriber, nothing happens, and it allows you to separate the 2 parts of functionality you feel are different.  if for instance, after doing something else you needed the...
15:12  RTPMatt_: ...buttins to be fixed again, you can always just publish "hey fix your buttons" again.

16:14  level09: how to inject complex string using the .html() method ?
16:14  erichynds: o rly
16:14  erichynds: _zoggy_, either, length is preferred
16:15  _zoggy_: tried length but it returns 1
16:15  _zoggy_: not 46 like i expect
16:16  _zoggy_: var n = $jQuery("select#dropDown").length();
16:16  erichynds: do $("select option").length
16:16  ohst: anyone know of a good live search that  fires only when the user stops typing
16:16  erichynds: ur counting #dropDown, not the num of option tags
16:16  ohst: http://nakajima.github.com/jquery-livesearch/
16:16  erichynds: osht, i just show'd you how
16:16  _zoggy_: oh gotcha
16:16  ohst: i know but the throttle does not work well wit hthis plugin

16:17  ohst: i am saying the plugin code from what i see fires too many times
16:17  erichynds: so throttle keyup or whatever at like 300ms
16:17  SeriousJonny: hoi
16:19  ohst: erichynds, it seems like after you run a search you cannot throttle again
16:19  solars: hey, is there a or for selectors? like $("#foo OR #bar") ?
16:20  ohst: solars $("#foo, #bar")
16:20  Afuna: solars: try a comma
16:20  solars: thanks!
16:20  erichynds: ohst, are you throttling the logic in the actual plugin- the stuff that is bound to key events?
16:20  ohst: no, should i be editing the plugin directly do you think?
16:20  erichynds: i dunno why he is binding to keyup, keydown, and keypress... seems a little redundant
16:20  ohst: wasnt sure where to place it
16:21  erichynds: ohst yah put it in there
16:21  ohst: that is what i am saying
16:21  ohst: this plugin might not be very good
16:21  ohst: or maybe that is the only way to do it
16:21  erichynds: all u should need is keyup and blur
16:21  lithi_: I like blur.

16:51  erichynds: omg no
16:51  RTPMatt_: kenno: in general, that is not a good idea
16:52  sean``: kenno, ##php
16:52  sean``: also, kenno you could add a class to those elements
16:52  sean``: and just use $('.foobar');
16:52  kenno: I would like to conditionally add classes
16:53  kenno: if value from database is 2, then add class .whatever
16:53  kenno: and so on
16:53  lithi_: o_O
16:53  lithi_: I see no point for echoing javascript
16:53  lithi_: to be honest
16:53  orolo: for the boilerplate html, there is a js/plugins.js referenced; my question is where do i put my plugins?

16:54  k1ng__: kenno, are you newbie to php?
16:54  avillanueva: http://pastebin.com/DFTEBjYt
16:54  effekt: kenno: worst code I've seen in a while. add those styles to CSS, call the classes whatever-<id>, add the class to whatever they apply to, done. You don't need any javascript for that.
16:55  sean``: kenno, why don't you do that when you generate the output
16:55  sean``: it makes no sense to iterate the same set for manipulatino
16:55  Ryro: kenno, what is your end goal with the code?
16:56  kenno: im making a map with maphilight( jquery plugin) and i need to fill those areas on map which has status value in database 2 or 3
16:56  kenno: and both different colors
16:57  kenno: {stroke:true,strokeColor:'3d3939',fillColor:'C80D00',fillOpacity:1.0,alwaysOn:true} is the class code to fill
16:57  kenno: and so I thought to use php to get values from db
16:58  kenno: and then conditionally add the class to elements who has those statuses

17:23  crab: if i have a form with multiple inputs of the same name, can i count on browsers to submit the empty values as well?
17:23  CGo`Work: See, if the element with (value) ID exists, it changes the value under that key to the element's value.
17:24  CGo`Work: However I'm noticing that if I use this syntax, oa[index] = value, the object array is destroyed.
17:24  CGo`Work: Or it's wrongly interpreted, anyway.
17:24  CGo`Work: I'm passing this on to an $.ajax() request, and it can't read it as data anymore.

18:27  Ryro: put a div infront of it and fade it in and out
18:27  serio: yeah
18:27  dalela: mhh
18:27  serio: use absolutely positioned divs with your background images and fade those in and out.
18:27  dalela: but the div has to be positioned absolute, right?
18:28  Ryro: it just has to be a div that takes up the full width, it could be fixed or just a friggn large div
18:28  Ryro: *width and height
18:28  NiftyLettuce: you could do absolute container with floaters/z-index inside

18:29  NiftyLettuce: z-index

18:30  dalela: right?

18:32  NiftyLettuce: note the use of z-index

18:32  dalela: but it is positioned absolute
18:33  NiftyLettuce: best way to learn is to just play with css and think logically
18:33  NiftyLettuce: stackoverflow great resource for basic css troubleshooting
18:33  Ryro: heres a good place to start - http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp

18:35  serio: dalela, http://jsfiddle.net/serio/qe9Cg/4/
18:35  dowut: wtf
18:35  dowut: it works on jsfiddle..
18:35  serio: it's fading the text too, but you get the idea
18:35  serio: it was just a quick test.
18:35  dalela: great, thanks
18:35  serio: a hack of another script.
18:35  serio: it's totally busted.
18:35  serio: actually.
18:36  NiftyLettuce: serio: neat images
18:36  dowut: lol
18:36  dowut: i forgot $(function(){
18:37  RTPMatt_: ah

18:39  amano: hello
18:39  RTPMatt_: hello
18:39  amano: how can i toggle the possition between two elements
18:39  Rovanion: So I've taken the #id of a header which underneath has a text that I want to animate when the header is clicked. The id of the text is the headers id +Text. So I first run: var name = this.id; name += "Text"; And I then try to run: $(name).animate(...). Though this doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?
18:40  amano: I mean: <div id="id_1"></div><div id="id_2"></div> to be <div id="id_2"></div><div id="id_1"></div>
18:40  RTPMatt_: amano: give them a class that positions them as you like, then toggleClass() on them?
18:40  amano: how can I do that
18:40  Ryro: or modify the dom?
18:40  amano: I don't mean "toggle visibility"
18:41  RTPMatt_: yeah, you have to just modify the DOM in that case
18:41  Ryro: what is the purpose in moving them, is it visual only?
18:41  amano: I've tried, but jquery removes some attributes, I have them lost...
18:41  Ryro: have you used .detach()
18:41  amano: reorder them
18:41  dowut: ? click
18:41  bot-t: .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
18:41  amano: just reorder them visually
18:42  Ryro: if its just 2 divs then absolutely just toggle the css classes
18:42  Ryro: course that depends on how you have them positioned
18:45  amano: thanks, detach() works, it isn't loosing attributes now
18:45  dowut: what is the difference between    $(document).ready(function() { });    &&  $(function(){ });
18:46  Ryro: one executes when the dom is deemed ready the other just executes
18:46  Rovanion: So I've taken the #id of a header which underneath has a text that I want to animate when the header is clicked. The id of the text is the headers id +Text. So I first run: var name = this.id; name += "Text"; And I then try to run: $(name).animate(...). Though this doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?
18:47  dowut: which should be used for something like .blur() events?
18:47  dowut: $('input[name^="menutab_"]').blur(function(){ })
18:47  RTPMatt_: dowut: they are the same
18:47  dowut: doesnt really trigger until user uses the textbox
18:47  amano: thanks again
18:47  dowut: thats what i figure
18:48  Ryro: for the most part... ive experienced bugs in ie using the latter
