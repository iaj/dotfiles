00:00  RTPMatt: verloc: you shoukd check out rebecca murphy jquery beginners docs
00:01  dshap: frigginCarebear: just tried to code you gave me above, with the bind call on a new <img /> element.  and i made it append to a div that has display:none, and it works!
00:01  dshap: frigginCarebear: even though the div is set to display none, when you add an img to it, it preloads it
00:01  dshap: frigginCarebear: at least in firefox it does
00:02  dshap: frigginCarebear: thanks
00:02  frigginCarebear: dshap: try IE before u shout victory :P
00:03  dshap: frigginCarebear: heh true
00:03  dshap: frigginCarebear: or i could just choose to not support IE users :-p
00:03  coldhead: do it, dshap
00:03  RTPMatt: dshap: i wish that were an option~
00:03  dshap: coldhead: this isn't anything mission-critical
00:03  dshap: this is a silly facebook app i've created
00:04  dshap: that shows you photos of people your'e not friends with :-p
00:04  coldhead: mmm, sounds direspectful to privacy
00:04  coldhead: so facebook
00:05  RTPMatt: is that no the facebook MO?
00:05  dshap: well
00:05  RTPMatt: *not
00:06  dshap: it just organizes the photos you can already see
00:06  dshap: it doesn't show you any photos that you can't access already
00:07  dshap: it searches your mutual friends' albums & tags, and aggregates photos that have a specific individual tagged, who's not necessarily your facebook friend
00:15  coldhead: so in a way, dshap... you're an american hero?
00:19  Bhavic: Whats the var_dump command in JS? Ie to print it to console
00:19  Bhavic: to check the vals of vars
00:19  destinydriven: console.log()
00:19  camonz: how can I check if an element is of type of an element?
00:19  camonz: sorry... badly edited; how can I check the type of an element

00:57  jedimind: so ... not much coldhead
00:57  coldhead: gross story, bro
00:57  Bhavic: How would i go about getting the value of a hiddenfield?
00:57  jedimind: coldhead :)
00:57  coldhead: $('input:hidden').val()
00:57  jedimind: Bhavic, the same way you would a non hidden field
00:57  Bhavic: Ahh
00:57  Bhavic: Thanks
01:00  lonimurar: how does one avoid getting those dotted borders around <a> when they're clicked? I'm using jquery tools and it seems like that for some <a>s I get no dotted borders
01:02  hobs: http://haslayout.net/css-tuts/Removing-Dotted-Border-on-Clicked-Links
01:02  hobs: this mentions the js and css methods
01:02  hobs: to do that
01:05  Snerf: anyone happen to know of a good undo/redo plugin?
01:06 * coldhead np: rodan - the everyday world of bodies
01:06  coldhead: interesting concept, Snerf
01:06  coldhead: i've never seen such a thing
01:07  coldhead: IT NEVER RESTS
01:08  coldhead: IT NEVER SLEEPS
01:08  Snerf: coldhead, I am making an editing thing, and need a way to undo/redo items.. I tried a few thing myself, I just cant get the concept right
01:08  coldhead: ITS RUSTED
01:08  coldhead: ITS COMING
01:08  coldhead: Snerf: google knows of a few of them, but the way they work seems to vary widely
01:08  RTPMatt: what would you want beond the normal OS undo/redo?
01:08  coldhead: maybe check the stack overflow post google mentions
01:08  Snerf: coldhead google knows of plugins that dont work a damn
01:09  coldhead: that has expertise
01:09  Snerf: RTPMatt, this isnt for the OS, this is for an online app
01:09  Snerf: say like an online text editor
01:09  coldhead: undo/redo is so nebulous. its like trying to do a plugin to increase productivity
01:09  coldhead: ITS RUSTED
01:09  coldhead: ITS COMING
01:10  int_64: hello, question about the jquery.corner plugin....It works flawlessly in firefox, but in IE sometime sI have problems
01:10 --- sumeet_ is now known as shipit
01:10  RTPMatt: yeah, but i can still to undo/redo in my browser, the OS handles it, so what else do you want?
01:10  int_64: My current problem is that I can use borders in firefox...but the borders do not work in IE
01:10  Snerf: well, I think its vital
01:10  int_64: anyone have a fix for this?
01:10  int_64: or another plugin that actually works in IE always?
01:10  Snerf: RTPMatt, not in this case
01:10  int_64: hmm, my post nay have gotten garbled
01:11  int_64: I am referring to the jquery.corner.js plugin :)
01:11  Snerf: RTPMatt, if your doing online editing in a textbox, changing colors and such, I would like for it to be able to unod-redo items
01:11  SeriousJonny: god this is so frustiating
01:12  SeriousJonny: still no solution :((

01:12  coldhead: hell no, SeriousJonny , not that i'd ever admit to
01:12  int_64: meaning I get paid for it
01:12  SeriousJonny: nice
01:13  coldhead: SQL is so brown ties and 70s
01:13  int_64: I surely am not an expert
01:13  int_64: just a pro
01:13  Snerf: coldhead, with stackover post, the 1st link provides no source, and the 2nd one basically no documention, but it is one I am looking at more
01:13  int_64: if you get my meaning
01:13  coldhead: active record is the bet thing that ever happened to SQL
01:13  coldhead: best*
01:13  RTPMatt: Snerf: well, i guess it depends on your needs, but you could like save it to an array on .change() and revert as the user needs?
01:13  SeriousJonny: int_64 look i have this scenario http://pastebin.com/AHsPDtFM
01:13  coldhead: sorry Snerf, i've never heard of undo/redo plugins before today so i got no tips
01:13  coldhead: i'd rely on the OS, as suggested
01:14  coldhead: laziness ftw
01:14  int_64: hmm
01:14  int_64: it appears there is only one level of depth
01:14  dub54: anyone familar with uncaught exception: unknown player iframe in shadowbox?
01:14  SeriousJonny: yep
01:14  SeriousJonny: this is not really a tree
01:14  int_64: hmm
01:14  int_64: let me think about this
01:14  int_64: becayuse on first blush I dont see the complexity
01:15  Snerf: RTPMatt, yes, what I am attempting.. juist frustated with it, so thought maybe someone made one already :)
01:15  coldhead: good luck int_64
01:15  int_64: I am clearly missing something as this is Thanksgiving and I have had drinks
01:15  SeriousJonny: xD
01:15  coldhead: Snerf: maybe search forum.jquery.com ?
01:15  SeriousJonny: happy thanksgiving to you all :D
01:15  coldhead: I TRADED YOU
01:15  coldhead: I TRADED YOU
01:16  SeriousJonny: the only guy wich responded to this solution is gone in #sql :D muha thought i made him ragequit XD
01:16  int_64: ok
01:16  int_64: you can do a inner join
01:17  int_64: it will only return categories with at least one matching user..
01:17  coldhead: blergh
01:17  JKarsrud: when did this turn into #mysql?
01:17  SeriousJonny: since mysql couldnt handle the problem :D
01:17  JKarsrud: ...
01:17  int_64: Serious, do you understand inner joins?
01:17  coldhead: since int_64 kindly lent a hand after he got some jQuery help
01:17  SeriousJonny: <3 int_64
01:17  SeriousJonny: and int_64 no :D
01:18  dub54: anyone familar with shadowbox?
01:18  int_64: ok, well with normal joins (aka outer) you return rows even without a match in the other table
01:18 --- Suga is now known as SugaSlide
01:18  int_64: with inner joins, there must be a match
01:18  SeriousJonny: i see
01:18  int_64: so even though it isnt really a pretty soluytioin
01:18  int_64: it is quick, simple, and elegant
01:18  int_64: well not elegant
01:18  int_64: but quick and easy
01:18 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
01:18  int_64: ideally you would have designed your database in such a way to account for this fact
01:19  SeriousJonny: i didnt
01:19  SeriousJonny: design this
01:19  int_64: but since that is not the case, an inner join will be your easiest solution
01:19  SeriousJonny: this is what i have to work with
01:19  coldhead: of course you didn't
01:19  int_64: ok
01:19  SeriousJonny: i diiiiidnt really i swear :D

01:19  SeriousJonny: on a holy day like this dont make me swear coldi
01:20  coldhead: yeah we're good bro
01:20  coldhead: don't sweat it
01:20  SeriousJonny: god my head explodes
01:20  scutum: quick question, here at http://www.farilist.com/USA.inc.php I would like it so all other states will disappear after the user clicks of the state
01:20  SeriousJonny: i have read myself since 2 hours between mysql documents
01:20  SeriousJonny: my frist idea  was
01:21  SeriousJonny: just build up a multidimensional array
01:21  SeriousJonny: with all categories
01:21  scutum: I tried $(this).parent().siblings().find('li').fadeOut();
01:21  int_64: serious, lord no
01:21  scutum: but wont do :(
01:21  int_64: serious, keep it simple
01:21  int_64: always keep your database as simpleas possible
01:22  int_64: I mean to say database logic
01:22  SeriousJonny: based on my pastebin
01:22  SeriousJonny: can you give me quick sql advice
01:22  scutum: $('#menu li a').click(
01:22  SeriousJonny: how i should leftjoin
01:22  scutum: function() {
01:22  scutum: $(this).next().slideToggle('normal');
01:22  scutum: SeriousJonny try #sql
01:22  int_64: Serious, I would recommend the wikipedia article on joins
01:22  SeriousJonny: scumt iam in sql
01:23  int_64: it is by far the best article on joins I have ever read
01:23  int_64: seriously
01:23  int_64: I sometimes refer back to it mnyself
01:23  SeriousJonny: the only guy left 30mins ago and still left me with the problem :D
01:23  scutum: help me with my problem and I will help you with yours
01:23  scutum: :D
01:24  scutum: Im pretty good at sql
01:24  int_64: SeriousJonny, if you dont want to bother with joins, there is another option
01:24  int_64: a distant second...
01:24  int_64: you could select each category
01:24  int_64: then iterate in your server side lang over each one
01:24 * coldhead np: rodan - gauge
01:24  int_64: and inside th eloop do another query selecting the count of users for that category
01:24  int_64: a very Freshman type approach
01:24  int_64: but if you dont cre about how crappy the code is, it will work fine
01:25  int_64: and it will be fast, provided you dont have many users or categories
01:25  scutum: I got a jquery question...
01:25  SeriousJonny: this was my frist attempt
01:25  scutum: please please help
01:25  int_64: you could also do things with sub selects..etc
01:25  SeriousJonny: but there are 4k users 1k categories
01:25  int_64: but at the end of the day, an inner join is the best way
01:25  SeriousJonny: i fear this will be to bad
01:25  int_64: ok, if you have that many rows, then forget what I said
01:26  int_64: just learn about inner queries
01:28  coldhead: scutum: $(this).parent('li').siblings().hide().end().next().slideToggle('normal');
01:29  coldhead: that doesn't quite work
01:30  coldhead: but its in the right direction
01:30  scutum: ...
01:30  scutum: let me check
01:31  Bhavic: Does fadeIn() change the display: attr?
01:31  int_64: coldhead,  I am checking our "roundrect" on github...but how do I get to the documentation?
01:32  int_64: I really am behind on github...I have barely ever been expoised to it
01:32  coldhead: there is a readme file
01:32  coldhead: https://github.com/csnover/RoundRect
01:32  int_64: oh
01:32  int_64: gotcha
01:32  coldhead: there's not much to know
01:33  coldhead: snover here is the author, you can bug him when he's around for free support
01:33  int_64: ccan it allow me to only round certain corners? like upper left, or bottom right, etc?
01:34  Bhavic: Could anyone please tell me how i can get the <p> inside a <span id="x">
01:34  coldhead: int_64: dunno :(
01:34  int_64: no probs..thanks anyways
01:34  coldhead: int_64: actually, knowing snover, it should be fine
01:34  coldhead: it just uses CSS
01:35  int_64: ok
01:35  Hello71: Bhavic: span#x > p?
01:35  coldhead: so just CSS style the corners you want
01:35  Bhavic: Ah ok
01:35  Bhavic: thanks
01:35  scutum: I gave it a try
01:35  Hello71: just remove the ? and the Bhavic:
01:35  scutum: and always lefts one more
01:35  Bhavic: Kik
01:35  scutum: http://www.farilist.com/USA.inc.php
01:35  Bhavic: Lol*
01:36  scutum: coldhead, how can I do to make them all dissapear?
01:37  coldhead: scutum: siblings().andSelf() ?
01:37  coldhead: except that might make the submenu disappear too
01:37  coldhead: >: \
01:38  scutum: no I dont want the submenu to dissapear
01:38  scutum: disappear
01:38  scutum: just the other stater
01:38  coldhead: oh actually
01:38  scutum: states
01:38  coldhead: .andSelf won't affect the submenu
01:39  coldhead: why the hell is it leaving some?
01:39  scutum: $(this).parent('li').siblings().hide().end().next().slideToggle('normal');
01:39  scutum: will leave one
01:39  scutum: let me check
01:40  coldhead: it really should
01:40  scutum: nope
01:40  scutum: it leaves one
01:40  scutum: next to it
01:40  scutum: strange
01:41  int_64: coldhead, sappologies..but I need more advice on snover's plugin
01:41  int_64: What class, or id, do I assign something I want \rounded.
01:41  int_64: his instructions dont specify that
01:41  coldhead: int_64: do you know how to do rounded corners in CSS?
01:42  int_64: coldhead, um, well I have used imaged and CSS in the past to do that..but I dont know a pure CSS way to do it, no
01:42  coldhead: you should just do it in CSS and his code will magically round your corners in IE
01:42  int_64: images*
01:42  coldhead: which doesn't do CSS rounding
01:42  Trisox: he want to round numbers
01:42  int_64: oh
01:42  Trisox: oh
01:42  int_64: hmm
01:42  Trisox: :P
01:42  scutum: coldhead, >	$(this).parent('li').siblings().hide().end().next().slideToggle('normal'); will leave one state still
01:42  coldhead: ?g css rounded corners

01:42  user2009: hello all, got a question about the use of "live()" method.
01:42  int_64: much obliged, good man
01:42  user2009: is it possible to find if a node X (with event Y) in a document may match a handler created with live()?
01:43  int_64: yeah, never done that border-radius thing before
01:43  Trisox: first time i saw some one call coldhead a good man
01:43  Trisox: ;)
01:43  coldhead: scutum: maybe try return false from your click() handler
01:43  coldhead: Trisox will probably be able to help you out

01:44  SugaSlide: good man to coldy????
01:45  coldhead: it was a typo
01:46  SugaSlide: hmm.. surely [{"a":"1","b":"2"}] == {"a":"1","b":"2"}
01:46  SugaSlide: getjson doesnnt agree
01:46  SugaSlide: it doesnt work with the [] version lol
01:46  int_64: hurrah! it works
01:46  SugaSlide: am i missing somehting?
01:46  int_64: now, to see if I can make it work on selected corners.
01:47  coldhead: scutum: you don't want to add my code AND your code. my code was meant to replace yours
01:47  user2009: anyone please?
01:48  coldhead: snover, your roundrect just made int_64's day
01:48  scutum: yes I tried
01:48  scutum: ok
01:48  snover: I need to deprecate that and link people to css3pie
01:48  int_64: I spoke a tad bit too soon
01:48  int_64: I hate to piss in cheerios and what not
01:48  scutum: could you please give your code on the click event
01:48  int_64: But it appears I still have an IE issue
01:48  int_64: hopefully it is my own screwup
01:48  int_64: I shall report back in 10 or so minute
01:48  snover: go use css3pie
01:50  coldhead: scutum: $('#menu li a').click(function () {$(this).parent('li').siblings().hide(); $(this).next().slideToggle('normal'); return false;})
01:50  coldhead: that works for me
01:51  scutum: man you are great
01:51  scutum: :)
01:51  coldhead: sorry for the bother
01:52  scutum: Im sorry myself
01:52  scutum: Im terrible at this
01:52  coldhead: scutum: one thing you might consider, instead of hide()ing the siblings, is fading them out
01:52  scutum: Im going to take a class on Lynda learn a bit more
01:52  coldhead: so that the menu stays in the same place on the screen
01:52  scutum: yes
01:52  scutum: O thoguht about that
01:52  scutum: will look nicer
01:53  coldhead: $('#menu li a').click(function () {$(this).parent('li').siblings().fadeTo(0,0); $(this).next().slideToggle('normal'); return false;})
01:53  coldhead: does that
01:53  coldhead: and you can change how slow the fade is

01:56  Hopsy: huh
01:56  IceD^: well, I can add it in JS part, but still
01:56  Hopsy: weird a's

02:02  int_64: is it close to firebug in quality now?
02:03  user2009: sorry,i don't use firebug. need venkman to debug extensions
02:03  int_64: ah ok
02:04  PeterDrop: not easy that venkman xD

02:10  bot-t: Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
02:10  codeputty: the elements must not exist when the code is running if size() is zero

02:19  IceD^: ok, and another (kinda OT) q - trying to do str.replace('.*page=\(\d*\).*', '\1') to get page num from string like 'foo?page=1234&bar=244' - it looks like JS's replace doesn't support it
02:20  IceD^: yes, I know about url parse plugin, but... well... I'm not really sure if I can add even new JS to project
02:24  j0hng4lt: Is there a significant performance difference between .live() and .delegate() provided I can anchor my .delegate() to, say, a specific div?
02:24  coldhead: delegate is supposedly faster
02:25  coldhead: also its cooler
02:25  coldhead: and it gives better job security because its not as well understood
02:25  j0hng4lt: coldhead: lol
02:28  j0hng4lt: With .live, I've been doing things along the lines of $editor.find('a[href=#Delete]').live('click', ...)
02:28  j0hng4lt: Usually as part of a long chain
02:29  coldhead: cool
02:30  j0hng4lt: So this could work well with delegate. The only problem is that things that can get added or deleted would have to be included multiple times in the .delegate() selector
02:30  j0hng4lt: (instead of an extra .find())
02:32  arex\: Using jQuery UI Autocomplete, how can I avoid that the search after 1 typed characted returnes slower than the search after 2 typed characters?
02:33  arex\: in other words, the results for 1 typed characted is displayed after and overwrites the results for 2 typed characters
02:33  arex\: any request should bury the potential previous request
02:33  j0hng4lt: arex\: The delay is probably due to the fact that there are more items that match 1 character
02:34  rupert88: hi im trying to use a jquery ui element - datepicker
02:34  j0hng4lt: arex\: Are you pulling your items from the server via Ajax?
02:34  rupert88: however its not showing up wen i click on the input box
02:34  arex\: j0hng4lt: 1) yes, of course 2) yes
02:35  j0hng4lt: arex\: Try limiting the number of results returned by the server
02:36  arex\: seems like a nonoptimal solution - the problem can still appear due to some lag somewhere
02:37  snover: j0hng4lt: a[href=#Delete] is not a valid selector
02:38  j0hng4lt: snover: Sorry, I'm on an iphone... I quoted #Delete in my code
02:38  NET||abuse: ok,, i get a datetime string (YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm-ss) from json request,, i need to split it up in to date and time, and then years months days, and hours minutes seconds
02:39  NET||abuse: what's a good way to split up a string like that?
02:39  snover: Date.parse
02:39  rupert88: regex could work if you have to as well
02:39  j0hng4lt: arex\: Try using the minLength option
02:40  arex\: j0hng4lt: still a suboptimal solution, I want to be able to search on 1 character
02:40  j0hng4lt: arex\: Very rarely does it make sense to autocomplete after 1 character
02:40  coldhead: lol suboptimal
02:41  arex\: Still, using minLength doesn't address the problem at all. I can easily have the same problem with 3 and 4 chars, instead of 1 and 2.
02:42  rupert88: aww shucks, my my jquery was in the wrong place because i moved something earlier...
02:42  rupert88: that could explain why the datepicker ui wasnt working lol
02:45  j0hng4lt: arex\: You could try overriding .search() so you can keep track of whether there is a search in progress
02:45  j0hng4lt: arex\: That way, you can queue up searches
02:45  j0hng4lt: arex\: actually, there's no need to override, you can add a handler
02:46  rupert88: just wondering if theres a jquery accordion, and jquery datepicker ui why cant i find a input box or selection menu?
02:46  rupert88: can they not be styled or something?
02:46  coldhead: HEY WAIT A MINUTE JUST ONE LAST THING / DON'T FORGET TO PICK THE NEEDLE UP OFF THE LOCK GROOVE
02:47  arex\: j0hng4lt: sounds interesting
02:47  coldhead: its impossible to gauge the path of a reciprocal conversation

02:55  RiaGuy: Is there an easy way to find out height of a <td> cell including all the spacing around it? $('td').height() returns the height of an inner area of <td>
02:57  snover: RiaGuy: what have you tried, other than .height?
02:58  RiaGuy: innerHeight(), height() for <td> returns 290, but actually there should be 293
02:58  RiaGuy: height() on <tr> returns 291, still 2px missing
02:59  Third3ye: how about outerHeight?
03:00  RiaGuy: Third3ye there are no such method
03:00  Third3ye: Strange it's in the API then
03:00  Third3ye: http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
03:00  snover: Third3ye: I like your brand of sarcasm.
03:00  Third3ye: :P
03:01  Third3ye: Yes, it's "Stoic Douché" by Giavani
03:03  RiaGuy: $('tr').outerHeight(true|false) still returns 291, 2 missing px from cellspacing or cellpadding
03:03  RiaGuy: is there a way to find out cellspacing value dynamically
03:04  snover: yes.
03:05  NET||abuse: hmm, will a div accept a title attribute? in markup
03:05  NET||abuse: trying to use jquery.countdown  plugin, and want to get the enddate for the countdown from the markup
03:08  snover: NET||abuse: yes; also, you can just look at the html4/5 spec to answer those questions
03:09  NET||abuse: snover: hmm, I never know the best place to go looking at specs for my info
03:09  snover: try searching for the title attribute.
03:10  RiaGuy: $('table')[0].cellSpacing, $('table')[0].cellPadding return an empty string. Any other ideas how to find out cellspacing/cellpadding?
03:11  snover: RiaGuy: it’s a css property…

03:39  ragefuljoe: snover> im using a list filter search script
03:39  ragefuljoe: an when I type the 3rd or 4th letter all the text on my screen goes pixelated

03:40  ragefuljoe: i have no idea y
03:40  ragefuljoe: then if i delete one letter the font is ok again
03:40  Third3ye: sounds like a bug to me
03:41  Third3ye: But, just to be sure: go to pastie.org or pastebin.org and paste your JQuery code
03:41  ragefuljoe: I think it's one of the included .js that Im using

04:39  aww_yeah: HTTP GET vs POST question: I know the difference between the two, but I'm not sure which I should use for this particular application: I have an AJAX request that sends a GET:'getPendingList'. This request should return a JSON string indicating a list pending requests that need to be approved.
04:39  aww_yeah: The problem is that GET requests can be cached.
04:39  aww_yeah: I don't want this to be cached because it can change.
04:39  rmurphey: aww_yeah: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
04:39  aww_yeah: Yet POST doesn't seem to be the right thing to do either...
04:39  rmurphey: set cache : false to prevent cache
04:40  rmurphey: use GET when you are getting data from the server without changing any data on the server
04:40  aww_yeah: sweet

04:40  rmurphey: use POST when changing data on the server

10:28  RikudoSennin: hey guys, I'm having a bit of a problem:
10:28  RikudoSennin: $('a[href='+window.location.hash+']')
10:28  snover: that’s not a valid selector.
10:29  RikudoSennin: when in the javascript file, it doesn't seem to target it properly (at all), but when I copy/paste it into firefox's console, it immidiately finds it.
10:29  RikudoSennin: snover, how come?
10:29  snover: because your attribute value is missing quotes
10:29  RikudoSennin: snover, where? how should it look like?
10:30  snover: ?attribute selector @ RikudoSennin
10:30  bot-t: RikudoSennin, Has Attribute Selector [name] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute, with any value. http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
10:30  snover: whoops.
10:30  snover: ?attribute equals selector @ RikudoSennin
10:30  bot-t: RikudoSennin, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
10:30  snover: RikudoSennin: read what it says about “value”
10:30  RikudoSennin: that's a bit new to me, but I'll give it a shot
10:30  snover: second
10:31  RikudoSennin: also the weird thing is, when copypasted into the console, it does findi t
10:31  RikudoSennin: find it*.
10:31  snover: IE sometimes makes href absolute.
10:31  snover: and there is nothing you can do to prevent this.
10:31  snover: so your attribute selector will fail to match.
10:31  RikudoSennin: snover, I changed every link to the form of #/path/
10:31  RikudoSennin: snover, with an each()
10:31  claudio: snover, I'll give you an aside "thank you" :) Reading css specs I always thought quotes were optionals.
10:32  snover: claudio: There is one instance where they are optional but it is way too hard to explain to most people
10:32  RikudoSennin: snover, nope, still doesn't seem to find it.
10:32  snover: RikudoSennin: using what?
10:32  RikudoSennin: $('a[href="'+window.location.hash+'"]').addClass('current_link').parent().addClass('current_page_item');
10:33  RikudoSennin: that's the full line
10:33  markj: ?demo @ RikudoSennin
10:33  bot-t: RikudoSennin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
10:33  RikudoSennin: http://yankele.co.il/#/about/
10:34  RikudoSennin: what SHOULD happen, is the page loads, immidiately loads the about page, AND change the current link in the nav above to a green light status next to the אודות link
10:34  RikudoSennin: in reality, both links remain in a red light status (as if none of them is loaded)
10:34  claudio: RikudoSennin, shouldn't you try the *= ?
10:35  RikudoSennin: it shouldn't matter, the link is an exact match to the hash
10:35  claudio: oh ok
10:35  markj: ive not had a long look, but the selector that isnt working is used before you change the links to be hashes
10:35  markj: would explain why it matches when ran in the console
10:35  markj: because by then the links have been manipulated

10:42  RikudoSennin: another question, less stupid this time (I hope)...
10:43  RikudoSennin: I want to calculate the height of: parent's padding top + child height + parent's padding bottom
10:43  RikudoSennin: only the result is displayed as a string ('20px24020px')
10:43  RikudoSennin: how can I get the padding value as a number?
10:43  JKarsrud: parseInt the values :)
10:44  RikudoSennin: '20px'.parseInt = 20?
10:44  JKarsrud: then you'll get the numeric values only
10:44  markj: ?g mdc parseInt
10:44  bot-t: markj, parseInt - MDC Doc Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
10:44  JKarsrud: parseInt("20px") = 20 yes

10:52  Iveaux: but instead of an empty id, not an  id at all
10:52  anli_: id="" ?
10:52  ravenzz: ?!
10:53  anli_: Why having an empty id then?
10:53  Iveaux: just to show what i am looking for
10:53  ravenzz: Iveaux jsfiddle.net
10:53  markj: Iveaux if you explain why you want to be able to do that, people might be able to suggest an alternative, because selecting something without an ID sounds strange
10:53  anli_: id="" doesnt make sense, has it been empty all the time, or did script empty it+
10:54  anli_: Or ids consisting of the empty string
10:54  Iveaux: just a sec, ill post some code :)

10:58  vanillaslice: hello
10:58  vanillaslice: hello
10:59  Superman_: hello hello
10:59  Iveaux: I found it, although maybe not very elegant:
10:59  Iveaux: $(".foo:not(.foo[id])")
11:00  lithi: anli_: So give it an ID?
11:00  Iveaux: if anyone has a prettier solution :)
11:00  lithi: id="blabla"
11:01  ravenzz: Iveaux you have to select any div that has .foo class
11:01  ravenzz: with some id?
11:01  Iveaux: without an id
11:01  nlogax: might be faster to do the id filtering later, i think that selector makes it bypass qSA
11:04  JKarsrud: nlogax: only one way to find that out ;)
11:05  Iveaux: so $(".foo").not(".foo[id]") ?
11:05  nlogax: .not("[id]")
11:06  Iveaux: ah
11:06  Iveaux: of course :)
11:06  ravenzz: yea
11:06  ravenzz: $(".foo:not(.foo[id])").remove();
11:06  ravenzz: could be ok
11:06  Iveaux: or $(".foo:not([id])").remove();
11:06  RikudoSennin: hmmmm
11:06  ravenzz: works too
11:06  JKarsrud: ravenzz: Depends.. If the selector bypasses qSA it will be slower
11:06  RikudoSennin: http://yankele.co.il/ << click on דף הבית link, and see what happens
11:07  lithi: RikudoSennin: i'll pass
11:07  Iveaux: alright, thanks guys :)
11:08  RikudoSennin: instead of animating to the full 405px height, it animates to 166px for some reason, and I have no idea why...
11:08  RikudoSennin: it's the last action executed, so it shouldn't miss anything happening prior to it..

11:13  mammut: how do you use "each" to only loop through a certain number of elements?
11:14  nlogax: could .slice().each

11:15  nlogax: slice it to the subset you want before eaching

14:14  RobertsR: KeeperOfTheSoul, didn't quite good understood your question...
14:15  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: be better to wire up the click handlers, etc in a document ready function rather than inline like that
14:15  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: eg, $('input[name=first_name]', context) then all you need to do is find the right context
14:15  RobertsR: Yeah, I know that, but I have a problem to sort out, how to point those values to each input
14:16  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: in that case the context would be the parent <div class="tableDataContent">
14:16  KeeperOfTheSoul_: well, the context you want
14:16 --- wasabist_ is now known as wasabist
14:17  RobertsR: brr, why does this must be so hard to understand :D
14:17  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: as for the original values, you could use either a hidden input <input type="hidden" name="orig_last_name"> or a data attribute <input type=text name=first_name data-original-value="...">
14:18  RobertsR: KeeperOfTheSoul, hmm, this makes sense :)
14:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: look up the jquery docs on selector context (basically, says only search with in this context (ie these dom nodes)
14:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: RobertsR: so step 1, from this (the cancel link) find the parent tableDataContent, that's your context
14:22  RobertsR: Oh gosh, this makes lots of headaches :)
14:25  RobertsR: KeeperOfTheSoul, then I should count, how much in this page are those input[name="first_name"], then somehow get this inputs order number, and then i could successfully point this value only for this input... Right?

15:07  schweizer: is there a OR selector? like e.g. $('.superclass input OR span').atombomb() ?
15:07  schweizer: can this be done via css selectors?
15:07  Iszak: $('.superclass').find('input,span')
15:07  schweizer: maybe (input|span) ?
15:07  schweizer: ah ok, the Iszak
15:07  schweizer: thx
15:07  sean`: the Iszak
15:08  Iszak: No problem, use an element prefix too.
15:08  sean`: capital THE
15:08  Iszak: e.g. div.superclass
15:08  schweizer: ok
15:08  schweizer: is that considered 'cleaner' ?
15:08  Amel: sean`, I have a div, and an element with the "head" class under it. Then I want to append the id of the div to the "head" class
15:08  Iszak: It's considered faster for browsers who don't have get element by class name.
15:08  Amel: If that brings any clarity
15:08  Iszak: I wouldn't say cleaner.
15:08  schweizer: ok
15:09  sean`: Amel, it's soooooooo hard
15:09  sean`: a simple question
15:09  sean`: what's the markup
15:09  sean`: which is literlaly copy/paset

15:13  KeeperOfTheSoul_: I'm sure someone mentioned one the other day though
15:13  friendly-strang: Anybody know a plugin that does the same as 'placeholder' on input tags in html5
15:13  SugaSlide: so submit form via ajax.. it returns json
15:13  Hopsy: KeeperOfTheSoul_ *
15:13  Iszak: Smooth sean`.
15:13  sean`: Amel, create a jsfiddle
15:13  Iszak: SugaSlide, ya much lighter than XML too.
15:13  SugaSlide: so i can return a bunch of info like ID, name etc..
15:13  sean`: xml sucks
15:13  Iszak: No it doesn't.
15:13  sean`: jason is hawt
15:14  SugaSlide: haha
15:14  sean`: I know, it doesn't :p
15:14  SugaSlide: no no noooooooo
15:14  Iszak: So don't say it.
15:14  SugaSlide: i havent used XML in a web app before
15:14  SugaSlide: :.
15:14  sean`: it's not hard
15:14  boobo: Adding new content to a table using a modal... should I make one modal html for new content and one for update content?
15:15  boobo: or just add a hidden "update id" field when a edit link is clicked?
15:17  sveajobb: anyone knows of a good flexible menu plugin? perhaps something that kinda emulates the mac 'bigger on hover' image kinda thing. Preferably vertical instead of horizontal
15:17  Iszak: I think they call that fisheye.
15:17  sveajobb: Aah
15:18  Hishi[Revo]: why cant i get this to work? http://pastebin.com/CHh2Fyqp
15:18  Iszak: sveajobb, I would link you to something but I'm sure you're capable :)
15:18  Aamir: http://interface.eyecon.ro/demos/fisheye.html
15:18  serio: sveajobb, are you talking about the dock?
15:18  Iszak: Hishi[Revo], try and avoid inline events if you can.
15:18  buddyq: .is(:visible...
15:18  sveajobb: serio, not sure what it's called. I don't use mac ;)
15:18  buddyq: just do $('.myclass:visible')
15:19  webflo: was the best way to alter all link in an string of html?
15:19  Iszak: $('div.myclass').click(function(){$(this).filter(':visible').hide();});
15:19  sveajobb: thanks Iszak and Aamir :)
15:19  Iszak: Hishi[Revo], ^
15:19  Hishi[Revo]: thanks. ill try that
15:19  buddyq: Hishi[Revo], did you see?
15:19  Iszak: no onclick ;)
15:19  nlogax: sveajobb: $(".yourclass").click(function() { $(this).toggle() })
15:19  nlogax: sorry, Hishi[Revo] i mean ^
15:19  Hishi[Revo]: yes buddyq. :P
15:20  Iszak: or if you want to toggle it ^
15:20  nlogax: i gues it will be hard to toggle back once it's hidden
15:20  nlogax: details.... >_>
15:20  Iszak: boobo, are you doing an AJAX request? why would you need to store the update id?
15:20  Aamir: Hishi[Revo]:  http://jsbin.com/anowa4/edit
15:20  GreaterCore: hello, is anyone around?
15:21  Aamir: ?ask @GreaterCore

15:21  Hishi[Revo]: i have a working toggle function which im using in a menu. problem is that i want all that i have toggled to "show" to be shown after i reload the page. (aka follow a link to the same page)
15:23  poppiez: hi, I've attached $.ajaxSuccess to an element. I want it to trigger _before_ the success in a random ajax call triggers. right now, if I do an ajax request, its success function calls and then afterwards $.ajaxSuccess runs
15:23  poppiez: how can I do this?
15:23  Hopsy: is it possible to do an and like in this way $(".form" and ".input")
15:23  Aamir: Hishi[Revo]:  may be http://jsbin.com/anowa4/2/edit
15:23  poppiez: Hopsy: $('.form, .input');
15:24  Hopsy: ok thanks poppiez
15:24  Iszak: AND would be .form.input, no?
15:24  Iszak: OR would be .form, .input
15:24  Aamir: poppiez:  is right
15:24  Hishi[Revo]: Aamir not quite but something like that
15:25  Aamir: ?multiple-selector @Hopsy
15:25  bot-t: Hopsy, Multiple Selector (“selector1, selector2, selectorN”) - Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
15:25  boobo: Iszak: hmz.. to pass the db row to update?
15:25  Iszak: oh right, hmm.
15:25  buddyq: <div class="one two"> would be $('.one.two')
15:25  Aamir: true
15:26  buddyq: div class 'two' inside div class 'one' would be $('.one .two')
15:26  darkmist: is there a window.open (URL, windowName ..) equivalent in jQuery Mobile??
15:26  boobo: I could probably paste the code..
15:27  Hopsy: Aamir: and an or ?
15:27  Hopsy: selector 1 or selector 2
15:28  Aamir: Hopsy:  AND
15:28  Hory: why does jQuery UI Resizable require the UI CSS to included for it to work?
15:28  darkmist: is there a window.open (URL, windowName ..) equivalent in jQuery Mobile??
15:28  sean`: darkmist, <a href="" target="_blank"
15:29  Aamir: Hornet:  may be the resizable icon ? and also while you resizing and have duplicate copy of the actual element which get styled using UI css - may
15:29  Aamir: darkmist:  window.open will work on mobile
15:29  Hopsy: Aamir: i have a search input, when i not pointed with my mouse to it, it doesnt dissapear
15:29 --- riven` is now known as riven
15:30  darkmist: sean`: href points to the URL, right? what about target?
15:30  sean`: you don't know what the target attrib ute does?
15:32  poppiez: how can I make the ajax complete callback function run before the success callback function?

15:38  boobo: seems like its easier to make a create modal and a update modal.. but it had been nice to reuse the code for both operations
15:47  Nomikos: Is it possible with jQuery mobile to drag elements on the page around, without the phone thinking you want to drag the page around?
15:47  Nomikos: (.. and how can it tell the difference?)
15:47  Nomikos: Same for iPad and whatever else they come up with these days
15:48  MrJones: hi
15:49  MrJones: I'm using $(domelement).replaceWith('<img ..>'); and it doesn't appear to work :( when examining the domelement in firebug (which is an <input> originally), it's still an <input> afterwards
15:49  MrJones: alerts() I put after the replace line get executed so it doesn't stop due to an error or something
15:49  MrJones: :/
15:50  Nomikos: Maybe it can't find $(domelement) ? if you append css('background', 'red'); does that work?
15:50  MrJones: Nomikos: domelement is a local var
15:50  Nomikos: Keep the error console open anyway, can never hurt
15:50  MrJones: and it comes from windowObj.document.createElement
15:51  Fichte: can i change the tagname with jquery?
15:51  MrJones: firebug doesn't report any errors
15:51  Fichte: i have an a-tag but want it to be a span tag
15:51  claudio: MrJones, you have to appended the new element
15:51  MrJones: I do that later
15:51  MrJones: it is visible, but it is an <input>
15:51  MrJones: although the replacing html specifies an <img>
15:51  MrJones: the code runs through happily, no errors, but when appending the resulting thing I simply end up with an <input> :|
15:52  claudio: MrJones, if you .hide() the element instead of replacing it, does it work?
15:52  MrJones: no
15:52  MrJones: I only have the new element as html
15:52  Nomikos: pastebin?
15:52  MrJones: I dunno what else to do with that except use it with .replaceWith
15:53  claudio: yes, paste the code somewhere
15:54  MrJones: http://fpaste.org/I15a/ type is "input", class name "btn_bag". id contains the html code. I get both alerts and also the funtion returns the element and it gets appended, but by seeing it and examining it with firebug, it's an <input>
15:54  MrJones: although id contains an <img> tag
15:55  fruitwerks: I want to fade in a body background image, is this possible? I know it is simple to do with any image given an id, but this is a bit diff.
15:55  SugaSlide: can you doa  ajax type: "POST" and dataType: "json" in the same call?
15:55  MrJones: the exact contents passed to img are: <img src="includes/languages/english/images/buttons/button_add_to_back.gif" border="0" alt="" width="71" height="26">
15:55  MrJones: *passed to id are
15:57  MrJones: anyone having an idea? :x
15:57  Nomikos: MrJones: does it work if you replace id with the html code on line 9, in the pastebin sample?
15:58  claudio: MrJones, your code is really a mess, sorry.
15:58  Nomikos: MrJones: long shot, but it's possible that id as a variable name confuses things
15:58  claudio: MrJones, anyway, I'd try replacing the element AFTER you  appended it
15:59  MrJones: claudio: don't blame me for someone else's code >.> that suggestion sounds nice though
16:01  fruitwerks: hmm $("body").css("background", "url('/css/metal.gif')").fadeIn(600); - works, but no fade action?
16:01  Nomikos: MrJones: I think I see it - you're appending element, but the replacement was done on $(element)
16:01  Nomikos: one is the DOM object, the other a jQuery object
16:03  _cb: <li id = '1'>one</li><img src ="add.png"></img></li>  How do I get to the image src? $("#1"). ?
16:05  Nomikos: _cb: id values can't start with numbers
16:05  claudio: fruitwerks, I don't think there is a way. The only things that I could think of is something about .animate() and rgba
16:05  Nomikos: _cb: and you're closing the <li> twice, I assume the one right before the img tag shouldn't be there
16:06  claudio: fruitwerks, like varying the alpha channel of the background as a whole
16:06  _cb: <li id = 'A'>one</li><img src ="add.png"></img>  How do I get to the image src? $("#a"). ?
16:06  Nomikos: _cb: as for the image src, try $("#A img").attr('src');
16:06  fruitwerks: claudio, yeah looking more like a css3 thing, or plaster a div with a low z-index and go from there
16:06  Nomikos: _cb: and <img> doesn't have a closing tag ..
16:07  Nomikos: Unless this is some exotic flavour of XHTML I haven't heard of
16:07  MrJones: Nomikos: given I append element first, a nonjquery object.. shouldn't I be able to do $(element).replaceWith() afterwards to turn it into a jQuery object, and then replace it?
16:08  MrJones: I just tried that and it doesn't seem to work either :|
16:09  Nomikos: MrJones: once you have appended it, I think you need to tell jQuery where to find it first, again - not sure if the JS variable will still point to the object after appending it
16:09  Wiz_KeeD: hey guys
16:09  Wiz_KeeD: can anyone please help me with the datepicker to set the minimum date on a picker?
16:09  Nomikos: MrJones: can you append $(element) itself instead, using jQuery ?
16:09  Wiz_KeeD: i tried the one in the documentation it simply won't load the datepicker
16:12  MrJones: Nomikos: I'll try in a second... actually, the replacement code "works" now - the button disappears :|
16:12  Nomikos: MrJones: progress! :-)
16:12  MrJones: searching in firebug, it has turned into an <img> but is displayed in 'disabled grey' in the firebug list
16:12  MrJones: now I have no idea what that means, but it doesn't look as if it was visible as intended
16:12  MrJones: I can't spot a css hide though
16:12  MrJones: so basically it seems to be there but not visible for whatever reason that is not obvious to me :x
16:12  Nomikos: MrJones: is one of its parents invisible maybe?
16:13  MrJones: the parent looks normal in the firebug graph
16:13  StR: Hi everyone
16:13  MrJones: it's just a div
16:13  MrJones: no css hide to be seen either
16:14  _cb: Nomikos that worked Thanks!
16:14  MrJones: hah
16:14  MrJones: Nomikos: the image was simply not there (broken image). lol
16:14  MrJones: fixed!! :D
16:14  StR: anyone using jqGrid? I'm trying to understand what to return to when the user clicks the save button in the edit form. Anyone? Thank you very much
16:14  MrJones: basically the hint to replace it after appending it to the parent solved things
16:14  Nomikos: MrJones: I would edit the DOM via Firefox, see if content insert right before or after the image shows up. if it does, it's the image itself somehow. See if other image tags work, there
16:14  Nomikos: MrJones: ah, cool :)
16:15  Nomikos: _cb: you're welcome. try HTML validating now and then, too ;-)

16:44  buddyq: its a dat picker... not a time picker?
16:45  hejner: buddyq: That is true, but date pickers in my mind should be able to extend into time as well if needed. Maybe my personal opinion differs from the jQuery UI team - that is why I'm asking if there is something I overlooked, or it's working as intented
16:46  Lumpio-: It's a *Date*picker

16:52  MrJones: hi guys
16:53  MrJones: I do: element = $(element).replaceWith('<img src="path/to/image.gif">');
16:53  MrJones: element is a DOM element (not a jquery object) that has already been added to the graph
16:53  MrJones: now that works
16:53  MrJones: but $(element).click(function(e) {alert("test");}); doesn't :(
16:54  MrJones: and when I'm adding element directly as img to the DOM, then it works (without using replaceWith() afterwards on it)
16:54  MrJones: so for some reason when using .replaceWith() on element, I can't use .click() lateron :/
16:55  MrJones: is that expected/correct? since it's not clear to me at all why that should be the case
