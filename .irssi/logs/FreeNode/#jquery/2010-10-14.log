00:00  bot-t: lathan, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
00:00  BMCouto: because getScript() its supposed to do that
00:00  naimon: hello everyone
00:00  BMCouto: and its the shorhand for the ajax()
00:00  naimon: I have a problem with animate method
00:00  lathan: BMCouto, setting the dataType to script doesn't make it run it....
00:00  lathan: naimon, continue...
00:01  BMCouto: lathan: so what does it?
00:01  lathan: BMCouto, create a scripttag with that as its src
00:01  lathan: in the head
00:01  naimon: I apply that method an absolute div element to change top attribute
00:01  lathan: ?demo @ naimon
00:01  bot-t: naimon, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
00:02  BMCouto: lathan: how? a script tag where?
00:02  naimon: but when check that div during animation I cannot get top value
00:02  BMCouto: on the url?
00:02  lathan: BMCouto, in the head
00:02  naimon: I get the starting position
00:02  lathan: ?demo @ naimon

00:02  BMCouto: lathan: i dont want that
00:03  BMCouto: i want to call it there inside the fcuntion
00:03  naimon: lathan: ok. just a sec
00:03  lathan: BMCouto, you can do that.....
00:03  BMCouto: lathan: its a global function so i dont want call it on each head of each page
00:04  BMCouto: like you can see on my code the function gets called depending on the <a>
00:09  ei2matrix: Hello, I am trying to modify a site that has been created (which by the way is a mess but I have been tasked with the update of a file upload process) to this end I decided to use uploadify plugin, which I have used on other ocassions withouth issues, however this time I am getting an error that states that " $("#image_path").uploadify is not a function"  despite the fact that I can verify in firebug that the uploadify javascript is found and loaded on
00:11  lathan: ei2matrix, something must be destroying uploadify
00:11  lathan: try on the firebug console $().uploadify
00:11  lathan: (no parenthesis ), ei2matrix
00:11  ei2matrix: lathan: let me give it a shot
00:12  ei2matrix: get a type error
00:12  ei2matrix: $.uploadify is not a function
00:12 @ajpiano: ei2matrix, is jQuery even properly loaded?
00:12 @ajpiano: console.log($) console.log(jQuery)
00:13  lathan: ei2matrix, not $.uploadify $().uploadify (sorry my mistake)
00:13  ei2matrix: ajpiano: function() in both cases so Iĺl assume JQuery is properly loaded
00:13 @ajpiano: hmm
00:13  ei2matrix: lathan: let me give it another shot
00:13  lathan: $.uploadify is different than $('div').
00:14  ei2matrix: lathan: $().uploadify doesn't output anything
00:15  ei2matrix: however
00:15  ei2matrix: $().uploadify() errors
00:15  jqp: when working with the 'unload' event, is there a way to distinguish when the user closes the browser and when they simply go to another page?
00:15  ei2matrix: I should be getting a "function()" output for $().uploadify shouldn't I?
00:16  lathan: ok, uploadify is not loaded
00:17  lathan: ei2matrix, yes, but try it without the final (), do it like this exactly: $().uploadify
00:17  ei2matrix: right tried both ways
00:17  ei2matrix: withouth the parenthesis, I get no output at all
00:17  lathan: meaning its not defined...
00:18  lathan: try firebugging the uploadify scripttag, make sure the source is real (hit the plus next to the script tag)
00:18  ei2matrix: wait, just noticed  we are loading jquery, then uploadify, then jquery again
00:18  lathan: bad news...
00:19  ei2matrix: must be the redefinition of $ that's killing uploadify
00:19  lathan: jqp, not that I am aware of
00:19  ei2matrix: let me get that solved, thank a lot for the suppport guys
00:19  lathan: ei2matrix, uploadify is extending the first jquery, and jquery is clobbering itself
00:19  jqp: lathan: i think i may be able to use the 'context' property of the jquery object
00:19  lathan: ?context @ lathan
00:19  bot-t: lathan, context: The DOM node context originally passed to jQuery(); if none was passed then context will likely be the document. http://api.jquery.com/context/
00:20  lathan: I doubt it...
00:21  jqp: agreed.  the context of 'unload' is always the browser window (as opposed to the document)

00:22  ei2matrix: lathan ajpiano, that was it, thanks again for your time guys
00:23  lathan: np
00:23  lathan: jqp, give me a minute, looking at the arguments given: http://www.jsfiddle.net/dEvyW/1/
00:24  BMCouto: lathan: any other suggestion?
00:25  lathan: BMCouto, just load the script on all the pages, and let the browser cache it...
00:25  BMCouto: lathan thats what i want to avoid
00:26  lathan: then no, I don't have any other suggestions...

00:35  peepz: what a wierd error.
00:35  peepz: $("#mediatype").val(data['media_type']).attr("selected", "selected");
00:35  peepz: the error log says: "$("

00:36  lathan: other way around, .attr(....).val(...)
00:36  lathan: or in 2 lines...shiver
00:37  lathan: peepz, .val(newValue) doesn't return the jquery Object, it returns undefined
00:37  erichynds: what?
00:37  erichynds: val is chainable
00:38  peepz: it works sometimes..
00:38  peepz: after I make some call or submission, it works..
00:38  lathan: peepz, no, erichynds is right...wierd
00:38  lathan: the source code has a lone return undefined at the end...
00:38  erichynds: it's not chainable as a getter
00:38  lathan: correct

00:39  peepz: ok will do
00:44  jqp: lathan: i think i may have found a way.  compare the 'originalTarget' properties of the 'unload' event between a window-based action like refreshing and a document-based action like a page transition
00:44  lathan: will do
00:45  lathan: jqp, both e.originalTarget == [ object HTMLDocument ]
00:46  hazamonzo: Folks i have a h3 with an id of "title1"   - should this code not change that h3? $("#title1").innerHTML = "foo";

00:48  bot-t: Excel, Escape the editable text (eg for "<b>jo</b>") | jQuery Plugins - I think in several places of the jEditable script the ".html()" method should be replaced with ".text()", so that input like " <b>jo</b> " does get escaped.

00:53  peepz: http://dev9.us/asset-form/asset.php
00:53  OhaiBBQ: post ends up calling ,ajax
00:53  peepz: here's the form

00:53  lathan: peepz, when you get to more complicated settings, you have to use $.ajax
00:54  peepz: ok, so I cant use the cache:false in this case? I have to turn my post to ajax?
00:54  jqp: lathan: oh, i see what you mean.  oddly enough, for me console.log(e.originalTarget) is always 'document', but console.log(e.toSource()) shows 'originalTarget' as #3# or #4#
00:54  dschuett: wow, i could get more answers in a channel that has nothing to do with my problem...
00:54  lathan: $.ajax({ method: "POST", cache: false, url: "ajax.php", data: {...}, success: function(data){...} });
00:54  lathan: peepz, ^^
00:54  lathan: toSource, ah...
00:54  peepz: oh nice, ill try that out right now thanks!
00:55  jqp: peepz: also consider $.ajaxSetup({cache: false});
00:55  lathan: jqp, peepz, but be warned, that is a global setting
00:55  jqp: lathan: any ideas on the reason for that discrepancy?
00:55  jqp: right
00:57  peepz: oh i rather use the global setting! will that effect my .post?
00:58  lathan: jqp, no idea, but my toSource() string shows currentTarget as #6=({})
01:04  peepz: http://pastebin.ca/1961369
01:04  peepz: it does not send the post data
01:06  lathan: peepz, you aren't telling it what to send

01:08  lathan: jquerykid, what?
01:08  jquerykid: lathan: my bad I think I got it!

01:12  lathan: .serialize
01:13  lathan: peepz, just select the form, its easier $('form#add-asset').serialize()
01:13  lathan: whatever your form id is
01:15  peepz: still does not work..
01:15  peepz: ill go back to my .post function instead.
01:17  lathan: peepz, you don't want cached posts...
01:17  peepz: ya, but I couldnt get it to work
01:17  peepz: did u visit the url?
01:17  lathan: just saw it, sry
01:18  peepz: cant I just disable caching globally and have it affect my .post?
01:18  lathan: yes
01:18  peepz: $.ajaxSetup({cache: false});
01:18  peepz: I have that right after my document.ready

02:11  vacuoustruth: thx
02:11  erichynds: what would happen if options.foo was "false" in that case?
02:12  vacuoustruth: looks like it would be overridden anyways
02:12  erichynds: yep
02:12  vacuoustruth: sweet. thanks for clarifying
02:12  erichynds: plus you'd have to do that one for each option

02:36  paul_irish: apollo9: sup
02:36  apollo9: Well, on the download link on the actual HTML5Boilerplate page, the IE conditional statements are on the body tag.
02:37  apollo9: In the GitHub page they're on the html tag

02:37  eTiger13: paul_irish:  what do you think about nov 4 or 11?

02:39  paul_irish: eTiger13: i think both are good looking dates.
02:39  eTiger13: Pymous: what do you mean select the next textarea? like other than tabbing through it or clicking on it?
02:39  paul_irish: apollo9: html tag is .. better
02:39  paul_irish: for all intents and purposes.
02:39  Pymous: eTiger13 > In fact, i want to use Tab for jumping to the next textarea :)

02:47  erichynds: why tab into something that's hidden?

02:47  Pymous: Try to click in one case
02:48  Pymous: It will show a textarea
02:48  Pymous: So, here is what i wan't to do
02:48  Pymous: When i tab, the next textarea showed up and is focus
02:48  Prometheus: so basically you want to hijack default tabbing behavior =P
02:49  Pymous: Prometheus > Yeah, kind of ^^
02:49  eTiger13: so when you tab you have to slide the next part open and then give focus to that box
02:49  Pymous: But it's possible, Google Spreadsheet do it :)
02:49  Pymous: eTiger13 > Exactly !
02:50  Pymous: (and if possible, slide up the first textarea for keeping the page clean
02:50  Pymous: )
02:50  eTiger13: Pymous: that page has a lot of invalid stuff and typos. you should fix it because my firefox doesnt like it

03:26  amouge: all of my form elements work fine except my checkboxes
03:26  amouge: if i take out the success and allow it to submit and redirect to a new page.. the checkboxes work fine... if not they just disapear out of the $_POST variable in php
03:27  eTiger13: amouge:  what do you mean your checkboxes dont work? like they dont show? or they dont submit their values?
03:28  amouge: they dont submit their values when i use the success return function
03:28  amouge: which makes no sense.. because they should be submitted before the "success" happens
03:28  amouge: but if i take out the success function that replaces the form with the new one... then they submit their values just fine
03:28  amouge: unless the return false on submit is causing the problem.. still dont see that causing it

04:00  amouge: ehynds: in php?
04:01  ehynds: no. jquery. but since you said php what's wrong with how jquery specializes it?
04:01  ehynds: serializes
04:02  amouge: ehynds: uhm.. i mean i could do a multiple replace I guess... and turn it into comma seperated.. but other than that.. its just a funky string that could be better serialized...
04:02  ehynds: but you want it as an array in pho?
04:03  amouge: ehynds... an array or comma sepperated is fine..
04:03  amouge: im going to serialize it in php and save it to the database that way
04:03  amouge: then pull it back out and unserialize it into an array to use foreach functions on later on
04:03  ehynds: so what is the prob? php should turn it into an array
04:04  HarryPitfall: as long there is [], php will transform into a array
04:04  HarryPitfall: a[]=1&a[]=3 will become a = array(1, 2)
04:04  HarryPitfall: buts there extras ; will break php...
04:05  amouge: yea.. there are the ;'s in between the pickup and [] for some reason..
04:05  HarryPitfall: you will still have a $_REQUEST['pickup;']
04:05  HarryPitfall: that is the array with the keys
04:05  HarryPitfall: :3
04:06  amouge: HarryPitfall: not when submitting through ajax
04:06  amouge: thats the whole problem is submitting these through ajax..
04:06  HarryPitfall: i do ajax all the time... with php as  backend
04:06  amouge: im manually passing the different items.. is there an easier way?
04:06  amouge: to just tell it to pass all form values like it normally would?
04:07  Pymous: Bye all ! (Thanks for the help again :) )
04:07  paul_irish: bye
04:08  amouge: if there is a way to tell $.ajax() to just pass all form values like it normally would.. that would be great
04:08  erichynds: amouge: traditional mode
04:10  HarryPitfall: serialize function looks good
04:10  HarryPitfall: and you can just pass into a ajax call, as "value", and parse_str() on php... do deserialize...
04:11  HarryPitfall: php have a function that takes a query string, and build a associative array, parse_str() if I remember well
04:11  amouge: HarryPitfall: you are correct.. which would be great... if the checkboxes were being passed correctly... :/
04:12  amouge: but they are coming out with the pickup;[]=1
04:12  HarryPitfall: check the name
04:12  cfddream: quit
04:12  HarryPitfall: looks like the checkbox name is "pickup;"
04:13  amouge: <input type="checkbox" name="pickup[]" value="<?php echo $row->id; ?>" /> <?php echo $row->location; ?><br />
04:13  amouge: nope
04:13  dougb: i have the following script: http://pastebin.com/K2qmvGwJ it will show a button to pop up the datepicker.  is it possible using that script that i can specify a class to it?
04:13  amouge: and the first one in the serialized string doesnt have the ;
04:14  amouge: just all of them after it
04:14  HarryPitfall: look at serialize source code
04:14  dougb: a class to the button i mean, i already know that .date is specified for the text box
04:14  amouge: pickup[]=1&pickup;[]=2&pickup;[]=3 is what it serializes it to...
04:14  HarryPitfall: or build your own code
04:14  HarryPitfall: :3
04:14  amouge: yea I guess I will just go back to my old code.. was just figuring there had to be a working built in way..
04:15  amouge: I was serializing them myself into comma seperated.. then exploding them into an array later in php..
04:15  amouge: but was gonna try to go with the serialize functions in php.. figured jquery's would work correctly
04:16  jowy: hi im trying to load some json. php json_encode is formatting my array as { "result" : "success", "data" : [ { ... }, { ... }, { ... } ] } -- but i need it to be { "result" : "success", "data" : [ [ ... ], [ ... ], [ ... ] ] }
04:16  hyperstream: dougb, you mean like: $(".date").addClass("Addthis"); ?
04:17  jjb123: Hey everyone! I was hoping to get some help with a little problem I'm having. http://pastebin.com/ctGBWicT Here is my code. Basically the problem is that when if I enter something in the "amount" field and then press the "Add Product or Service" button it wipes the entire field and resets the page. If any one could help me out with this I would really appreciate it as this has been driving me crazy trying to fix.
04:17  angryonion: hi
04:17  m0dmd: hey everyone
04:18  jjb123: hi
04:18  m0dmd: anyone know of a simple jquery fade in/out gallery that works with IE8 and PNG?
04:19  hyperstream: jjb123, need to use correct method to display the & (messing up the coloring of the paste lol)
04:20  jjb123: Oh sorry, let me fix that
04:20  hyperstream: not a problem, just viewing in my own editor now
04:20  jjb123: http://pastebin.com/RMZB56H1 here we are
04:20  dougb: hyperstream: you can see the issue i'm having here: http://imgur.com/aWrE1.png the javascript i pasted to pastebin is what creates that "filter" button.  you can see it is larger than the other buttons i have on the page because i cannot apply a class to it
04:22  hyperstream: jjb123, so when you click that button it fires the $("#add_item").click(addRow); event?
04:23  hyperstream: dougb, having a peak
04:23  dougb: thank you sir/ma'am
04:24  hyperstream: dougb, how do you want to add the class? when the page loads ?
04:24  dougb: it's through a stylesheet
04:24  dougb: someone gave me an answer on stackoverflow though, i'm going to try it now
04:24  amouge: erichynds: the traditional mode didnt fix it :/
04:24  amouge: I put jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional = true; before the ajax call
04:24  rullie: hello, with slide, whenever the DOM i'm sliding changes, the slide animation becomes jerky. Is this a known issue?
04:25  jjb123: hyperstream: yep, and for some reason when I do that with valid input in the amount box, it wipes it. However, when I do it with invalid input in the amount box (like letters or something that trips the validator) it doesn't do it
04:25  rullie: for instance, I slide the DOM up, modify its content, and slide it down. The animation is not as smooth as it normally is
04:25  jjb123: hyperstream: That is, it works as expected when there is invalid content in the amount box
04:25  dougb: wait a second, i'm a retard hyperstream i took a screenshot of the wrong page
04:27  dougb: i got it hyperstream!
04:27  hyperstream: jjb123, give me a sec bud (phone)
04:28  jjb123: hyperstream: no problem
04:28  hyperstream: dougb, what was the solution
04:28  dougb: the button had a clas of: .ui-datepicker-trigger
04:29  dougb: *class
04:33  hyperstream: dougb, ahh
04:33  dougb: i probably just overlooked it on the jquery-ui website
04:37  amouge: screw it.. i serialized the crap myself.. much easier
04:38  naquad: is there some plugin able to do something like "Featured Artist Bears" at http://www.bearpile.com/ ?
04:39  danheberden: naquad: withor without the broken css
04:39  OhaiBBQ: lol
04:40  danheberden: or inside the god-awful table
04:40  naquad: forget the page
04:40  OhaiBBQ: i think he just wants the bears

04:41  naquad: OhaiBBQ, yeah, and awful css, and table and other crap
04:41  danheberden: not often does a bear say "hi, molest me please"
04:41  OhaiBBQ: just noticed the site's name rofl
04:41  naquad: yeah, example i've shown is kind of creepy =\
04:42  danheberden: the bear in the header is like "i'm gonna find you in your sleep.. and suffocate you"
04:42  danheberden: every time you look at it, it's closer to you
04:42  infid: when there's already jquery embedded in many php pages, is there anything i can do to bottom load query libraries, or am i stuck with only 2 choices of either taking the jquery to separate files or top-loading the libraries?
04:42  OhaiBBQ: lol
04:43  amouge: holy fudge... a $500 bear?
04:43  amouge: is there gold bulion inside??
04:43  amouge: or at least a happy ending? :-p
04:43  dougb: is there a channel for website critiquing?
04:43  amouge: dougb: I have a great domain name in mind for one :)
04:44  amouge: and its only 6 letters long
04:44  dougb: reddit?
04:44  amouge: haha.. no
04:44  amouge: a non-taken domain
04:44  amouge: and its a "real" word somewhat
04:44  dougb: critqr?
04:44  amouge: nope :-p
04:45  dougb: good
04:45  amouge: you'll never guess it :)
04:45  dougb: i'll take that one :-P
04:45  amouge: lol
04:45  dougb: nevermind, some advertisement douche took it
04:45  amouge: lmao
04:45  amouge: mine is definately available.. sadly i dont even have the 11 bucks right now to buy it :-p
04:46  dougb: you already have the hosting?
04:46  amouge: yea i have 2 dedicated servers and 3 vps's at my disposal
04:46  dougb: do a freedns thing for the time being
04:47  amouge: dougb: not about that lol.. im talking about wanting to buy the domain..

04:47  amouge: but i wanna buy the domain before I say anything to anyone

04:54 * jjb123 bows down to hyperstream
04:55  hyperstream: :)
04:55  OhaiBBQ: this bear is a bit too creepy for me
04:55 @snover: that doesn’t do anything here.
04:56  OhaiBBQ: focus then blur the iframe
04:57  amouge: lmfao... its growing... omg.. .run!!!!
04:57  amouge: must... kill.... creepy.... bear!
04:59  Boohemian: hi all - to learn jquery, i need to be an expert at javascript, correct? (i am just starting out learning front end web design, and am trying to learn html, css and js over the next 6 months... what i see from the sites i develop for, jquery is used more than any other js library
05:00  OhaiBBQ: you don't need to be an expert, just watch out for creepy bear
05:00 @snover: ?101 @ Boohemian
05:00  bot-t: Boohemian, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
05:00 @snover: ?mdc @ Boohemian
05:00  bot-t: Boohemian, Mozilla Developer Center - https://developer.mozilla.org/
05:01  cmaujean: Boohemian: I don't think you need to be an expert at javascript. Having a handle on the basics of the language should be enough to get you started.
05:01  Boohemian: snover: thank you very much!
05:01  Boohemian: do i need to learn html and css before i can start learning js and a library like jquery?
05:01  OhaiBBQ: lol i keep refreshing my ticket to see if someone has replied
05:02 @snover: Boohemian: um, yes.
05:02  cmaujean: Boohemian: Yes, understanding HTML and CSS is very important.
05:02  Boohemian: ok
05:03  dougb: Boohemian: you should know how to create a red div with 2px black border centered in the page that is 15px from the top....then you can learn javascript ;-)
05:03  Boohemian: okay, i'll come back here in a few months :)
05:03  Boohemian: thanks
05:03  dougb: youll be back tomorrow, web dev is easy to pick up and hard to drop
05:04  l4rk: dougb: much like meth unforuntately
05:05  Boohemian: dougb: well, isn't design and dev different? i've always called myself a web developer - everyone i've worked with who have designed sites for me calls themselves a web designer
05:06  dougb: Boohemian: javascript can make web development easier in some aspects
05:06 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
05:06  dougb: jquery ui is amazing
05:06  dougb: instead of scripting a calendar in PHP, i was able to use its datepicker and that did all of the work for me
05:07  Boohemian: dougb: yeah, that's really why i want to learn it. i work a lot with drupal, and in drupal a lot of plugins use jquery for styling
05:08  hyperstream: *shivers drupal*
05:08  dougb: take a look at Boohemian, a lot of it is copy and paste
05:11  Boohemian: hyperstream: what's wrong with drupal?
05:12  danheberden: omg absolutely NO drupal talks tonight
05:12  Boohemian: dougb: yeah, i wonder how much of web design is new stuff - in the last few days when i've started to learn about html/css i've found COUNTLESS blog posts on recreating (what the blog author sees as cool) designs already in place (e.g. vimeo and digg header) just by googling "how to build a drop down menu with suckerfish
05:12  Boohemian: lol
05:12  dougb: yup
05:13  dougb: but that's how programmers learn, but copying other code and breaking it then figuring out how to make it work again :-P
05:13  at133: Is there a way to set the offset on a datepicker in 1.8.5?  In the past there was the dpSetOffset() method, but it doesn't work anymore.
05:14  hyperstream: Boohemian, im not even going to start on the subject lol
05:16  Boohemian: i'd really like to know what is so bad about drupal from a web design perspective? i have no insight into this, as the most html/css i know are how to make a bold tag and to align text inside a textfield :P
05:16  hyperstream: bold tag... lol
05:16  hyperstream: You'll pick up HTML/CSS pretty quick, i use HTML just for the elements, style it all using CSS
05:17  hyperstream: then jQuery to make things so sexy
05:17  danheberden: Boohemian: uh uh
05:17 * OhaiBBQ bows down to hyperstream
05:17  hyperstream: Damn, two bow's in one day lol
05:17  OhaiBBQ: ;D
05:18  dougb: Boohemian: i think it's just bloated.  but then if you go into PHP they tell you to use a framework which is confusing to set up and bloated in its own ways.  i prefer not to use a framework and just code from the ground up
05:18  paul_irish: hyperstream: sounds easy enough. you have a tut?
05:18  hyperstream: paul_irish, lol a tutorial for HTML/CSS?
05:18  OhaiBBQ: rofl
05:18  paul_irish: yah lol
05:18  hyperstream: dougb, Exactly - Just like in C :P
05:19  Boohemian: hyperstream: and even i am confused about the bold tag - why can't i use <b> anymore, why is the new way of bolding text with <strong>?
05:20  paul_irish: you can.
05:20  paul_irish: b tag is fine.
05:20  paul_irish: its in html5.
05:20  Boohemian: dougb: well, isn't jquery somewhat of a framework? i mean, "framework", "library" - what really is the difference? it's a way to code the underlying issue quicker
05:20  Boohemian: paul_irish: then what's up with this push on the <strong> tag?
05:21  paul_irish: bunch of assholes.
05:21  dougb: true, i guess i'm a hypocrite but i prefer to use the tools i'm comfortable with :-P
05:21  hyperstream: Boohemian, jquery is about the only framework/library i use period.
05:22  paul_irish: The strong element represents strong importance for its contents.
05:22  paul_irish: The b element represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is boldened.
05:22  hyperstream: CSS styling = win.
05:23  danheberden: ?mdc strong
05:23  bot-t: danheberden, strong - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/strong
05:25  OhaiBBQ: danheberden: have you played any kickball this week?
05:25  hyperstream: <i> and <b> were HTML4 font style elements and are still used presentationally where appropriate to follow typographic conventions. They now have semantic meaning, however, and their style can be changed via CSS, meaning they’re not only presentational — <b>, for example, doesn’t have to be bold. Because of this, it’s recommended to use classes to indicate meaning to make it easy to change the style later.
05:25  hyperstream: What is kickball?
05:25  danheberden: OhaiBBQ: did on sunday, won't this sunday cuz of jsconf
05:25  l4rk: google uses center tag and font tag
05:25  l4rk: so thats enough reason for me to use them :D
05:25  OhaiBBQ: ffff im the only one who isnt going
05:26  Boohemian: according to that page, danheberden , when i use a <b> tag, i should wrap it in any color other than black? hell, isn't "black" a "color"?
05:26  danheberden: wtf dude, why the hell not?
05:26  l4rk: maybe cause its sold out :-/
05:26  OhaiBBQ: im 16, no money, no job, i just code creepy bears for change on the street
05:26  Boohemian: i don't mean to be rude, but after reading that page, i feel like i was just in that meeting i had 29 weeks ago with some designers where we spent two hours debating the font to use for regular text on the website i was developing for. i think it was a complete waste of time
05:27  Boohemian: danheberden: '
05:27  Boohemian: Logical states separate presentation from the content, and by doing so allows for it to be expressed in many different ways, perhaps instead of rendering some text as bold you want to render it red, or a different size, or underlined, or whatever. '
05:27  infid: wwhen there's already jquery embedded in many php pages, is there anything i can do to bottom load query libraries, or am i stuck with only 2 choices of either taking the jquery to separate files or top-loading the libraries?
05:27  l4rk: Boohemian: typography is incredibly important
05:27  danheberden: so you don't like summaries that put the arguments succinctly Boohemian ?
05:27  danheberden: why <b> is a state and <strong indicates what the hell you're doing...
05:28  paul_irish: DONT U
05:28  hyperstream: l4rk, just reading, google does things like that to save bytes, (terabytes of data)
05:28  hyperstream: http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2005-11-17-n52.html

05:29  l4rk: hyperstream: i microoptimize everything i write
05:29  paul_irish: ooooh the editor of the html5 spec works for google
05:29  paul_irish: but we're gonna use the html5 doctype with a bunch of totally fucking nuts markup
05:29  paul_irish: just to screw with your heads.

Here is the beginning of the Response: http://pastebin.com/EEk434EE .. i tried data.d.rss.channel.title, d.rss.channel.title, nothing working, please help!
06:12  Ricoshady: not both, it seems like it grabbing both
06:14  serio_: bung, your data is ISO-8859-1
06:14  serio_: but montreal looks like it has an non ISO-8859-1 character in it
06:14  bung: hmm interesting
06:14  serio_: not sure if that would break your code though, this certainly doesn't look like full js source
06:15  serio_: just your json obj

06:15  bung: sorry
06:18  Ricoshady: anyone with a good way of gracefully swaping images, or divs?

06:23  aaroncampbell: dceartas: That's what I thought...maybe I'm doing something wrong in trying to use a variable as the key?
06:24  aaroncampbell: dceartas: I need to use the value of somevar[0] as the "key"
06:24  aaroncampbell: but myobj.somevar[0] = something didn't work
06:25  serio_: odd, it should work
06:25  serio_: could it be your data source, prehaps?
06:26  dceartas: hm. must be ambiguous to the interpreter. an extra line, var x = somevar[0]; myobj.x = value might clarify the issue?
06:26  dceartas: does [] always bind higher than . ?
06:27  bung: serio_: perhaps for sure, but then why can i JSON.stringify and output succesfully with the ajax version

06:32  dceartas: interesting.

06:59  akoimeexx: Hey all. I started building a jquery plugin to display weather for a given location. I use a sqlite database file to store latitude & longitude based on zip code, and am currently using a PHP wrapper to get at that. Is there a better way, rather than using a wrapper? Or with something like this, is a wrapper the only way to go?
07:02  danheberden: bot-t, does akoimeexx need to use jay-z?
07:02  bot-t: danheberden, Signs point to yes.
07:02  akoimeexx: jay-z?
07:02  danheberden: ?g jay-z
07:02  bot-t: danheberden, Jay-Z - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z
07:03  akoimeexx: danheberden: Definitely the rapper, not a wrapper. ;)

07:10  akoimeexx: At least it was funny. :)
07:10  hyperstream:  akoimeexx i dont really understand the question, you use a PHP Wrapper that accesses a database to retrieve long/lat based on zip code(s), you want to know what exactly ?
07:10  mghatiya: Hi, can anyone tell me if something is wrong with this code: ? http://pastebin.com/bavcSWE2
07:10  akoimeexx: If there's a better way to access large amounts of data for jquery to use.
07:11  akoimeexx: Basically.
07:11  hyperstream: mghatiya, looks fine from a quick view, have you tested it ?
07:11  akoimeexx: I'm dealing with a dataset almost 50,000 lines long, with over ten fields per set.
07:12  hyperstream: akoimeexx, i would just be using jquery to $.get and display the contents of the returned data
07:12  mghatiya: what is supposed to happen is if I select one radio button, a particular text-file is supposed to get disabled, and it should get enabled when i click on other radio button. But only half is working. i.e. text-field is getting enabled. but not getting disabled again. By default it is supposed to be disabled initially.
07:13  akoimeexx: hyperstream: That's what I figured... Just wondered if that was really kosher when putting it into a plugin.
07:13  echosystm: anyone know of a good javascript table enhancement that uses theme-roller themes?
07:13  echosystm: all i want to do is be able to make the columns sortable etc.
07:14  mghatiya: hyperstream: What is supposed to happen is if I select one radio button, a particular text-file is supposed to get disabled, and it should get enabled when i click on other radio button. But only half is working. i.e. text-field is getting enabled. but not getting disabled again. By default it is supposed to be disabled initially.
07:14  hyperstream: mghatiya, its grabbing the value of the input with name="monogramoption", if the value of it equals edit-monogramoption-no then it will disable, otherwise it'll remove a disabled tag
07:14  echosystm: ive just tried http://www.datatables.net/ and it totally sucks
07:15  echosystm: feature wise, its great
07:15  echosystm: but the themeing is complete fail
07:15  hyperstream: mghatiya, it will disable something with id="edit-monogram"
07:15  hyperstream: echosystm, jqgrid ?
07:16  mghatiya: hyperstream: Yes, that's what it is not doing. The other half of the expected functionality where it is "supposed to enable" is working
07:16  joelklabo: does anyone know how to get a scroll bar in jqueryUI tabs? if the content is larger than a certain size?
07:16  hyperstream: mghatiya, without seeing the full code i dont think i can help much(need to see the html involved etc)
07:16  echosystm: i dont think thats what im after hyperstream
07:16  echosystm: i want to take a html table and make the columns sortable
07:17  echosystm: and have the table use my jqueryUI theme
07:17  mghatiya: hyperstream: ok wait a sec. I will put "alert" and see if both alerts are getting invoked.
07:18  hyperstream: echosystm, sorry not sure, jqgrid is pretty customizable uses UI theme as well
07:18  echosystm: ah, sorry i was looking at the wrong demo
07:18  echosystm: it looks like this will work, thanks
07:19  echosystm: wait, no it wont
07:19  echosystm: sorry

07:20  HarryPitfall: flexigrid is very 'bare bones'

09:05  eirikb: sean`: That is the wrapping I mentioned earlier
09:05  sean`: Ricoshady, then you wrap it with a td, that's wrapped with a tr, that's wrapped with a tbody, thats wrapped with a table
09:05  sean`: I know
09:05  Ricoshady: yum
09:05  eirikb: sean`: Wasn't too keen on using it, but I guess its the best way?
09:05  sean`: it's nt bad to do it
09:05  eirikb: sean`: ok. Great, thanks I will use it
09:05  JKarsrud: best way would be to loop them imo
09:06  sean`: eirikb, you could use map
09:06  eirikb: sean`: And print them one by one?
09:07  eirikb: sean`: As in, that is automatically ofc, but the code would do that
09:07  Ricoshady: sean` what about wrapping multiple elements?
09:07  Ricoshady: like if I have two equal level divs

10:40  hmphf: so i was just wondering what might have gone wrong that would make it not work
10:40  eirikb: How can I select on elements that contain &nbsp; ? (I basically want to remove them, and maybe even change the element). Doing $myHtml.find(":contains('&nbsp;')") does not work
10:40  hmphf: while it worked in one server and it does not in another
10:41  Cork: eirikb: the &nbsp; has already been resolved when you look in the dom
10:41  eirikb: Cork: I also tried :contains(' ') without luck
10:42  eirikb: Cork: And it's not in the DOM
10:42  eirikb: My HTML, that is
10:43  Cork: eirikb: what is $myHTML if its not a dom element?
10:43  eirikb: Cork: And it's not :empty either
10:44  eirikb: Cork: var $myHTML = $("<div>...."); I'm guessing that will not go into the DOM
10:44  eirikb: So it's just a jQuery object floating around? :)
10:44  Cork: it doens't get put into the dom docuemnt, but it gets converted to dom
10:45  Cork: no
10:45  Cork: its generated un attached dom elements
10:45  eirikb: ok
10:45  eirikb: Anyway, how to get the elements?
10:45  hmphf: anybody, any idea, what might have gone wrong to my slider images not being shown in one server and being shown in another server?
10:47  Cork: eirikb: i'm not sure contains can find spaces
10:47  eirikb: Cork: So I have to manually do it? Like $each.($myHTML.find("*"), function(i, e) { ... });
10:48  Cork: eirikb: i think so
10:48  eirikb: Cork: Ok. Thanks
10:48  Cork: eirikb: but spaces exist in bundance in dom so...
10:49  Cork: you most likly will hit almost every element
10:49  eirikb: Cork: Yeah but the elements contain only that
10:49  eirikb: So it's as close to empty as I get
10:49  Cork: eirikb: then you don't want contains
10:49  Cork: you want is
10:49  Cork: not sure there is a trigger like that though
10:49  eirikb: :empty is a trigger, but as I said earlier it will not hit
10:50  eirikb: Err selector
10:50  Cork: eirikb: ya, but they arn't empty :)
10:50  Cork: they contain a space
10:50  eirikb: Yeah I know :/
10:51  eirikb: Is space printed out as &nbsp; again? Cause console.log($(e).html()) following my previous snippet prints &nbsp;
10:52  eirikb: Isn't that a bit strange considering what you said?
10:53  Cork: eirikb: .html converts it to html
10:54  Cork: eirikb: so it will have the entity in them
10:54  johnathanb: Hi, I know it's probably right in front of me, hell I've probably read it already but could someone point me but could someone possibly point me to where I would find out how to submit a form (POST) and get the result of that form back to do stuff with in jQuery please?
10:54  eirikb: So it knows that the space in the DOM is of that type?
10:54  Cork: .test() should print the text though
10:54  Cork: eirikb: it keeps the original html

11:17  rtil: blackspotwiggins: yes, the issue is that i am resizing a div element based on its child, an img tag that is resized based on the width of the page, then the height is set to auto. if i reference height(), it gives me its original, not resized height
11:17  blackspotwiggins: for ajax, probably no

11:33  SugaSlide: anyone wrked with paypal dev side before that i pick their brains a bit?
11:33  pLr: Bjornet: print it
11:33  SugaSlide: console.log()
11:33  SugaSlide: :P
11:33  blackspotwiggins: SugaSlide, use the api, all the advice i can give you :P
11:34  SugaSlide: well not sure which 1
11:34  SugaSlide: :(
11:34  blackspotwiggins: there used to be two ways to do that (don't know about now)
11:34  Clorith: I'm trying to grab the name of a table (using the attribute name=""), but I'm not getting it quite right, I have the following code; http://jsfiddle.net/QjrtG/
11:34  SugaSlide: setting up an application that the user puts in their pay pall details into admin... and then if anyone buys 1 of their items it pays to the users account
11:35  blackspotwiggins: i don't know the names
11:35  blackspotwiggins: but the old one just redirects you to a page on paypal
11:35  blackspotwiggins: but api is just that-communiation via api
11:35  blackspotwiggins: which means you can control stuff MUCH better later on
11:37  Bjornet: pLt: I didnt get u, Im new to js so please explain with an example
11:39  Bertrand: Bjornet: you need to have a debugger inplace so that you can print it to the console (IE8> developer tools; Firefox>firebug; Chrom> debugger; websit>debugger; etc) or wrap the var in an alert(var)
11:40  Bertrand: or put it into the .text() of an element $('selector').text(var)
11:40  blackspotwiggins: dont use alrt
11:40  blackspotwiggins: alert*
11:40  Bjornet: Bertrand: tnx, if I want to learn the debugger Firefox, how do I go about
11:41  Bjornet: var imgwidth = jQuery('.imgvisualparams img');
11:41  Bertrand: bjornet you need to install the firebug plugin
11:41  Bjornet: I have firebug
11:41  temp01: then you just do console.log(variable) and the value will appear in firebug's console
11:42  Bjornet: ah, then I need to be able to read the value ^^
11:42  Bertrand: inyour code then write console.log(imgwidth) and it will appear in the console (select the console tab in firebug)
11:42  Bjornet: cool, the row above: var imgwidth = jQuery('.imgvisualparams img');
11:42  Bertrand: after
11:42  Bjornet: will that contain information about the img?
11:42  Bjornet: for instance the width etc
11:43  temp01: ?tias
11:43  bot-t: Try It And See
11:43  Bertrand: no, imgwidth will be refernce to the jQuery object
11:43  Bjornet: Ok
11:44  Bertrand: personally, I'd write it: console.log(jQuery('.imgvisualparams img').width());
11:45  Bjornet: ah nice I try
11:45  Clorith: http://jsfiddle.net/QjrtG/2/ why do I keep getting undefined on my name variable here? (the first object in the returned element is <table name="someName">)
11:46  Bertrand: !!!! parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode
11:46  Clorith: yesyesyes

11:46  Clorith: That's what google informed me was the way to go about it >-<
11:46  gemmes: hi, does anyone know a jquery plugin that will find a specific tweet? or latest tweet with a certain tag?
11:47  temp01: Clorith: .closest()
11:48  Clorith: will that work backwards though?
11:48  Bertrand: upwards
11:48  Clorith: I'm thinking what if there's a <table> 2 lines under the <td>, and the one I want is 4 lines above
11:48  Bjornet: so if I want a button to trigger the measure of my img value and then set that value to another element I should partly use this code inside the #button-element?
11:48  Clorith: oh, I see
11:48  Clorith: ancestor :D
11:49  Superman_: i'm trying to create a dependent selectbox

12:00  matt1982_: I don't seem to be getting the styling sadly
12:01  sean`: well
12:02  sean`: have you checked your dom
12:03  temp01: matt1982_: yes, that's correct. a class would be better though
12:03  matt1982_: temp01, I have .orderLine on each row would the same apply just change it to $('.orderLine:even')....?
12:03  temp01: yes

12:13  Cork: Bjornet: $('.class *')
12:13  Bjornet: ..simple tnx Cork
12:13  Cork: Bjornet: but #wrapper-trigger is an id, so you don't need to filter it
12:14  Cork: it can only exist once in the page
12:14  Bjornet: And that is another biiiiiig flaw in by build! Ill fix that now!
12:15  Cork: Bjornet: so you can't actually make that kind of selection, as the dom don't store that data
12:15  gemmes: hi, does anyone know a jquery plugin that will find a specific tweet? or latest tweet with a certain tag?
12:15  temp01: gemmes: use the twitter api with $.getJSON
12:16  Cork: Bjornet: you would have to do something like $('.imgvisualparams [id="wrapper-trigger"]') (and thats really yucky!
12:16  Bjornet: ok ^^
12:17  Cork: Bjornet: if the name exists multible times in the page, use class
12:17  Cork: if its globaly uniq use id
12:17  gemmes: temp01: thanks, I was about to try that. I was hoping for plugin though.

12:57  saje: Any workarounds.
12:58  saje: It just sits there, forever.
12:58  doonie: sits how
12:58  mathi: screen-x, aaa k. yeah it's about horus and minutes, so biggest number is 59
12:58  jastor: saje: ask in #firefox or similiar channel? mayby firebug got their own forum
12:58  saje: It's stick at loading jquery, doonie.
12:58  saje: stuck*
12:58  doonie: ow
12:58  doonie: no neve seen that
12:58  screen-x: mathi: that expression should work then.
12:58  doonie: try the 1.6 ver
12:58  BudVar: doonie: I though $(data) would make data the selector, rather than the dom to be searched?
12:58  saje: Ah gosh darn it all to hell :/
12:58  mathi: screen-x, thanks. do you have a question ?
12:59  blackspotwiggins: mathi, http://pastebin.com/Lh6vfQsQ
12:59  doonie: BudVar $('<div>') creates stuff aswell, not just selects :)
12:59  amagee: ok, bug in jquery ui:  http://www.webdevout.net/test?0E
12:59  mekwall: Budvar is a nice beer ;D
12:59  screen-x: mathi: nope, just lurking :)
12:59  mathi: blackspotwiggins, thx I'll use it in future
12:59  amagee: in firefox, the dialog centres properly, in chrome, it centres only vertically, and remains to the left of the page
12:59  BudVar: I'm a nice person too :)
12:59  blackspotwiggins: i hope the usage is selfexplanatory
12:59  mekwall: :)
12:59  dr0id: doonie: see my question in #mysql please
13:00  blackspotwiggins: amagee, yea its a nasty bug
13:00  blackspotwiggins: set the margin to auto on the container
13:00 * doonie read sexplanatory
13:00  mathi: blackspotwiggins, sorry, I kinda suck at JS. how do I call that function ?
13:00  amagee: blackspotwiggins: which container?
13:00  blackspotwiggins: String.leftpad("1",2,"0")
13:00  blackspotwiggins: amagee, the one you are centering
13:01  mathi: blackspotwiggins, extending String JS class ?
13:01  mekwall: doonie, you are a pervert
13:01  blackspotwiggins: yea
13:01  doonie: ?pervert @ mekwall
13:01  bot-t: mekwall, SugaSlide and paul_irish
13:01  mathi: wow that's sick
13:01  mathi: thanks
13:01  JKarsrud: amagee: the dialog is contained inside some ui-dialog-container or something, put a margin auto on it
13:01  blackspotwiggins: actually
13:01  JKarsrud: It's a position-bug in chrome
13:01  mekwall: doonie, haha
13:01  mekwall: should add your name to that list
13:01 * blackspotwiggins highfives JKarsrud
13:01  SugaSlide: so now mek also in the perv group :P
13:01  mathi: blackspotwiggins, do you have a question ?
13:01  mekwall: ?pervert
13:01  bot-t: SugaSlide and paul_irish
13:01  mekwall: :p
13:02 * JKarsrud highfives blackspotwiggins back
13:02  doonie: :D
13:02  BudVar: so, if I do an ajax call, using $.get, and wish to extract just a certain div tag, am I right in using find on the returned data?
13:02  doonie: ?nlogax mom
13:02  bot-t: doonie, IRSeeK.com - Conversation page. Keywords: macdev - http://www.irseek.com/show.php?pageid=083b65ee48f911dea3537d667678ae8f&hilite=macdev
13:02  doonie: ;\
13:02  blackspotwiggins: mathi, it could be made as a function on the string itself
13:02  doonie: ?nlogaxs mom
13:02  bot-t: gay
13:02  blackspotwiggins: but as it is now, you have to call it separately
13:02  doonie: ?your_mom @ mekwall
13:02  bot-t: mekwall, console.dir( your_mom );
13:03  amagee: ah lovely, that fixed it, thanks guys
13:03  mathi: blackspotwiggins, it's like a static call now
13:03  temp01: bot-t: forget nlogaxs mom
13:03  mekwall: funny
13:03  bot-t: temp01, Forgot "nlogaxs mom".
13:03  temp01: bot-t: yes
13:03  bot-t: temp01, HELP | jQuery Plugins - Please how to add these Plugin to a drupal site??? http://plugins.jquery.com/content/help
13:03  temp01: er
13:03  temp01: BudVar: yes

13:03  mekwall: harr
13:04  mathi: to get the first element, I'm used to use ":first", but how do I get the second, there's no such thing as ":second"
13:04  mekwall: :eq(1)
13:05  mekwall: ?.eq @ mathi
13:05  bot-t: mathi, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
13:05  BudVar: temp01: cos it aint blooming working! :)
13:05  SugaSlide: :first:next

13:07  JKarsrud: dammit. Anyone know why the hell index can be .1 here: http://jsfiddle.net/gmCuJ/
13:07  JKarsrud: It works one site, but somehow it doesn't work on another. The markup is identical
13:07  mekwall: mackarell if you please :)
13:08  JKarsrud: Not my code btw, was just asked to implement it, and it doesn't work
13:08  mekwall: mackerel*
13:08  mekwall: doh
13:08  mekwall: can't spell
13:08  JKarsrud: Can't see why index = -1
13:08  JKarsrud: makrell plz
13:08  JKarsrud: :P
13:08  mathi: mekwall, thank you!! you got a question ?
13:08  mekwall: mathi, no :)
13:09  mathi: :-(
13:09  mekwall: most of the questions I ask here never get answered ;)
13:09  SugaSlide: uummm...
13:10  SugaSlide: you probs as Q's like "how hawt is your moms bewbs"
13:10  JKarsrud: tabIndex == -1 for some reason in my code
13:10  SugaSlide: not many peeps will answer that
13:10  mekwall: SugaSlide, that is not a question...
13:11  doonie: mekwall cause your q. are bad ;p
13:11 * doonie hugs his new nas
13:11 * mekwall kicks doonies new nas
13:12  doonie: oh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooo..............................
13:12  vector_xyz: hey guys does anyone know if there is a YUI (Yahoo) Theme for jQuery ?
13:12  BuGo_laptop: how to convert jquery object to string representation? $("<img  src=....>")
13:12  BudVar: temp01/doonie can you point me to an example of what I'm trying to do? I'm struggling to find an example @ jquery.com
13:12 * doonie points
13:12  mekwall: JKarsrud, that code is not so nice :P
13:12  mekwall: JKarsrud, mind adding the html as well so we can see that -1 ?
13:13 * BudVar slaps own forehead
13:13 --- pelle__ is now known as pelle_
13:13  JKarsrud: mekwall: I know it's not nice :P
13:13  JKarsrud: two secs :)
13:13 --- phpedinei_ is now known as phpedinei
13:13  mekwall: BudVar, what are you trying to do?
13:13  doonie: not sure where to find example, just try it :)
13:13  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, my questions never get answered too
13:13  mekwall: blackspotwiggins, 42!
13:13  SugaSlide: like... who let the dogs out?
13:13  mekwall: SugaSlide let the dogs out.
13:14  mekwall: and I'm more of a cat person
13:14  blackspotwiggins: no not like who let the dogs out
13:14  SugaSlide: who let the beeches outt he kitchen
13:14  mathi: i can help you guys, i'll try to answer your questions
13:14  SugaSlide: more to the point
13:14  BuGo_laptop: any 1?
13:14  BudVar: I'm trying to ajax a search page, by posting to itself, and then returning the contents of just a div tag into the same named tag on the current page. So far I can get it working if I just want the entire page in the div tag
13:14  blackspotwiggins: BudVar, how about you use traditional search?
13:15  blackspotwiggins: why do you need ajax?
13:15  mathi: but i'm pretty noobish
13:15  BudVar: blackspotwiggins: cos I'm trying to be fancy
13:15  SugaSlide: typewatch :P
13:15  BudVar: and the traditional post functionality works already
13:15  mekwall: BudVar, that has more to do with the backend then with the js ;)
13:15  SugaSlide: <div search form > <div to load results into >
13:15  mekwall: BudVar, what backend do you use?
13:16  blackspotwiggins: SugaSlide, if i have an array of sorted integers, how do you cluster them together given a tolerance
13:16  blackspotwiggins: stuff like that :P
13:16  BudVar: backend? you mean framework? it's bespoke
13:16  BudVar: and its in php
13:17  mekwall: never used that framework myself
13:17  SugaSlide: BudVar http://pastie.org/1220499
13:17  SugaSlide: not sre if its what you want
13:17  mekwall: so I can't really help you... but if it's based on MVC I guess you'll need to set up a separate view for your ajax request
13:17  JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/gmCuJ/1/ okay, seriously fucked up. It works on jsfiddle
13:18  johnathanb: Anyone got ANY idea why this isn't working?
13:18  johnathanb: http://pastie.org/1220501
13:18  mekwall: JKarsrud, it's not the code then :)
13:18  JKarsrud: No, clearly not
13:18  JKarsrud: :(
13:18  JKarsrud: Dammit
13:18  ablomen: JKarsrud, are you using an older version of jquery?
13:18  blackspotwiggins: johnathanb, i have
13:18  BudVar: mekwall: why? why can't I do a post to an existing page and extract the required data?
13:18  johnathanb: Ok.. So why? :D
13:18  JKarsrud: Dammit
13:19  blackspotwiggins: you are binding to an elment that does not exist at that point
13:19  mekwall: BudVar, you can... but that just doesn't make sense
13:19  blackspotwiggins: you need to use document.ready
13:19  dr0id: doesn't this means the direct li childs of ul -> 'ul.nav-1 > li a' ?
13:19  JKarsrud: ablomen: You're so right
13:19  johnathanb: Oh. My. Good. Jesusing. Fuck.
13:19  JKarsrud: This crappy site is running on 1.3.2
13:19  johnathanb: Thank you soo much :D
13:19  johnathanb: Been trying to get shit to work all morning.
13:19  JKarsrud: And then the code fails: http://jsfiddle.net/gmCuJ/2/
13:19  dr0id: doesn't this means the direct li childs of ul -> $('ul.nav-1 > li a') ?
13:19  JKarsrud: dr0id
13:20  JKarsrud: ypu
13:20  mekwall: BudVar, also... if you use ids... they would conflict ;)
13:20  JKarsrud: children even
13:20  dr0id: it selects all li
13:20  dr0id: my whole nav gets broken
13:20  ablomen: JKarsrud, there ya go, they changed the behaviour of index in 1.3.2
13:20  temp01: if all uls have class nav-1
13:20  temp01: it will do that
13:20  dr0id: all the li's/a get sorted in alphabetical order
13:20  ablomen: you will need to use $(what).index("selector")
13:20  JKarsrud: it selects all li's that are direct children of ul.nav-1
13:20  JKarsrud: Not only the first
13:21  SugaSlide: ul.nav-1 > li:prev:next:first a
13:21  dr0id: temp01: I want to sort the first level alphabetically first, then the second level and then the third level, is that possible with this plugin ?
13:21  BudVar: SugaSlide: that will help lots, as currently I'm doing a similar thing using keyup, so that is well better, but I'm looking to do a $.get and then injecting the code into a div
13:21  SugaSlide: post rather
13:21  dr0id: what was that ? :S
13:22  temp01: dr0id: it should be
13:22  johnathanb: And one last thing, anyone now know why THIS isn't working? :) http://pastie.org/1220510
13:22  temp01: make a demo if it doesn't work
13:22  temp01: ?sop @ johnathanb
13:23  mekwall: ul.nav-1 > li:prev:next:first a <--- lol
13:23  johnathanb: ?sop ??
13:23  SugaSlide: mekwall *flex*
13:23 * mekwall slaps SugaSlide with irrational thought
13:23  temp01: johnathanb: you can't $.post to a different domain
13:23  BuGo_laptop: can anyone tell me how to convert jquery object to html string?
13:23  johnathanb: It was working earlier though :/
13:24  ablomen: johnathanb, because you where dreaming
13:24  johnathanb: Is there any way then I can do what I want using POST?
13:24  mekwall: ?.html @ BuGo_laptop
13:24  JKarsrud: ablomen: Thanks, it was 1.3.2. But instead of rewriting the code, I'll go through the scripts and update to 1.4.2 :Ø
13:24  JKarsrud: :P
13:24  mekwall: hrmm
13:24  mekwall: bot-t is dead
13:24  JKarsrud: Now going out for a smoke
13:24  BudVar: SugaSlide: http://pastie.org/1220512
13:24  mekwall: BuGo_laptop, $(obj).html()
13:24  BudVar: or anyone
13:24  BuGo_laptop: mekwall, but isn't this returning innerHTML?
13:25  mekwall: BudVar, runningRequest is a useless var
13:25  dr0id: temp01: doesn't works -> http://pastie.org/private/gzjzc1dwxzltgv4ckuioeq
13:25  mekwall: BudVar, use the request var instead...
13:25  dr0id: all the li's inside ul.nav-1 gets sorted alphabetically = INCORRECT NAVIGATION :P
13:25  mekwall: BuGo_laptop, $(el).andSelf().html() :P
13:26  mekwall: not sure if that works though
13:26  BuGo_laptop: :)
13:26  BuGo_laptop: trying! tnx
13:26  ablomen: JKarsrud, even better
13:26  BudVar: mekwall: there is a missing if(runningRequest) { request.abort }  just above that snippet
13:26  mekwall: BudVar, then use request?
13:27  BudVar: mekwall: but other than that, you are suggesting that should work
13:27  mekwall: BudVar, if (request) { request.abort }
13:27  mekwall: set request to false when it's not running
13:27  BudVar: so, if (request) { request.abort() } ?
13:27  BudVar: fair enough, thanks for that, so what about my actual problem?

13:28  mghatiya: Hi, I want to access a child element by doing this $('.abc').children('.xyz')       But problem is, that particular child element is hidden, which is causing mentioned code to not work. How do I go about it?
13:29  temp01: it doesn't matter if it's hidden or not
13:30  mghatiya: hello temp01... But it is not working. Are you suggesting that something else might be wrong?
13:30  temp01: yes
13:30  mghatiya: hmm ok.. i will check. thanks.
13:30  temp01: check the dom in firebug and make sure .xyz is a child element of .abc
13:31  mghatiya: sure. thx
13:32  Mr_Nobody1: noob question incoming.
13:32  Mr_Nobody1: in <li><a></a></li> is the <a> tag a child of the <li> tag?

13:32  Mr_Nobody1: Ok.

13:34  freddy22: Hi, anyone where who got experience working with galleria? I would need some help, or perhaps any jQuery developer could help me. I am not really a programmer just need to modify the galleria gallery a little bit to fit my needs. ust some simle UI tweaks
13:34  freddy22: Maybe not simple for me, but I belive anyone knowing jQuery could accomplish it
13:35  mekwall: BuGo_laptop, well... Mine would still wrap the original element with a div ;)
13:35  freddy22: http://hem.agfoto.se/galleria/ - There is my galleria right know, I would like the red-dotted-border part to be moved down about 25-30px
13:35  Mr_Nobody1: So if i have $selected.eq(0).addClass('selected') and i want to also add the class to the selectors children, how do i chain it?
13:35  mekwall: BuGo_laptop, so you would have to unwrap it afterwards
13:35  Mr_Nobody1: *also
13:35  bot-t: BuGo_laptop, jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
13:35  Clorith: is it possible to tell .closest() to pick the 3rd closest element (or 2nd closest for that matter)
13:36  temp01: Clorith: .parents().eq(2)
13:36  Clorith: aha, thanks =)
13:37  mekwall: about that outerHTML snippet
13:37  mekwall: I disilke that it clones it
13:37  mekwall: dislike*
13:38  dr0id: thanks temp01
13:38  temp01: mekwall: why
13:38  mekwall: temp01, uses unnecessary resources :p
13:39  temp01: mekwall: but it would modify/move the original element otherwise
13:39  mekwall: not if you unwrap it directly
13:39  temp01: what
13:40 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
13:40  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/yVD27/
13:40  mekwall: like that
13:40  temp01: modifying live element in dom (wrapping/unwrapping) will be slower than cloning and using it
13:41  temp01: not to mention it will screw up for <li>s etc
13:41  mekwall: hmm
13:41  mekwall: perhaps
13:41  temp01: and it's not 1.3 friendly
13:41  temp01: etc
13:42  freddy22: Anyone able to help me with galleria?
13:44  sean`: ?ask @ freddy22
13:44  bot-t: freddy22, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

13:51  sabitertan: i cant get work that each function

13:52  sabitertan: ok
13:52  johnathanb: I need to post from my app (iPhone) to a different server then get some sort of response back. How can I? I can't have PHP or anything sitting in between as the app is running on the actual phone, not just being installed as a web app
13:53  sabitertan: http://pastebin.com/wu5vaU0h
13:54  sabitertan: and hole function i try to work is http://pastebin.com/kYLQHL5n
13:54  jastor: johnathanb: isnt there a #iphone-dev channel here?
13:54  l4rk: johnathanb: what does that have to do with #jquery
13:54  johnathanb: Because I'm using jQuery to build it.
13:55  l4rk: you just said its not a webapp
13:55  l4rk: you mean its in a webview or something?
13:55  johnathanb: It's written in HMTL, CSS and JS then installed on the phone through PhoneGap to make it more native.
13:55  l4rk: right
13:55  l4rk: use $.post
13:55  l4rk: the phone still has internet and its just a webview
13:55  johnathanb: That won't work going to a different domain though
13:56  l4rk: of course not, you'll have the same issues with a regular web page
13:56  johnathanb: Yea.. so I need a way around it.
13:56  jastor: johnathanb: so it only works localy? whats teh purpose of this then :) since its utterly useless
13:56  jazzanova: whats the status of this: http://ryanpricemedia.com/2008/03/19/jquery-broken-in-internet-explorer-put-your-documentready-at-the-bottom/
13:57  johnathanb: How's it useless?
13:57  jastor: johnathanb: if it cant work with the rest of teh web
13:57  Clorith: Even more issues arise, I'm on a roll today xD
13:57  johnathanb: Well that's what I want to solve and it only needs to work with a tiny little part of the web :)
13:57  Clorith: Got a datapicker and dynamically generated content, I'm using it with the .live() function and it believe I've set it up properly
13:57  Clorith: $(".date").live('click', function() { $(this).datepicker({showOn: 'focus'}).focus(); });
13:58  jastor: johnathanb: then youll have to ask in "phonegap"s forum, irc, whatever
13:58  l4rk: jazzanova: i dunno that doesn't look very accruate
13:58  l4rk: accurate*
13:58  l4rk: what the hell is a adjustedPrice element
13:58  johnathanb: But it's nothing to do with PhoneGap, i'm trying to do it with jQuery..
13:58  saje: "load" events fire twice for me on images, idea why?

13:59  jastor: xss is not jquerys fault
13:59  johnathanb: No. I'm trying to find a work around.
13:59  l4rk: johnathanb: if you have control of the server use jsonp
13:59  jastor: johnathanb: yes .. and that workaround youll have to ask for in ""phonegap"s forum, irc, whatever"
13:59  johnathanb: I  assumed I'm not the only person that has had this problem and that the problem has been solved at some point.
13:59  l4rk: if you don't write a proxy to convert to jsonp for you
13:59  l4rk: it has been
13:59  l4rk: it requires a server side fix
13:59  l4rk: unless you have control of the other end
14:00  johnathanb: Well I have control of the server.
14:00  johnathanb: All it does is take some information from form fields, put them into a PDF and email it.
14:00  l4rk: research jsonp then
14:01  l4rk: that will allow you to do your crossdomain request and read the response
14:01  sehh: hey people
14:01  sean`: ?
14:02  johnathanb: Will it allow me to POST? Can't see anything about it, only GET which is bit of a bumfuck
14:02  sehh: q: I'm trying to use .show() but when it displays my <div> it makes it into an inline element. Is there a way to use .show() but make my div into a block element instead of inline?
14:03  l4rk: johnathanb: sure?
14:03  l4rk: use $.ajax

14:11  sehh: q: I'm trying to use .show() but when it displays my <div> it makes it into an inline element. Is there a way to use .show() but make my div into a block element instead of inline?
14:11 --- s_ittna is now known as antti_s
14:11  erichynds: sehh: make your element block before the call to show()
14:12  sehh: erichynds, won't that display the element? then I don't even need show()... but I loose the animation feature
14:13  erichynds: what type of elem is it?
14:14  mongag: Can you recommend me some multiple upload lib based on ajax  for jquery ?
14:15  doonie: plupload
14:16  sehh: erichynds, its 3 <div> elements, stacked one of top of each other, all three of them are display:none, once the user makes an action, one of the three is displayed.
14:16  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/yVD27/1/ <-- what about that?
14:17  mekwall: extending the html function to allow return of parent
14:17  sehh: I tried .show(), which seems to work, but brakes the display of the element, it doesn't follow the width/height/margin rules that I've set, because show() forces the element to become inline.
14:17  erichynds: sehh, are you positive the display is set to inline after show?
14:17  erichynds: i disagree
14:18  SugaSlide: .show() says display:block
14:18  SugaSlide: ?source show
14:18  bot-t: Line#5456 - "show: function( speed, callback ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#line-5456
14:18  sehh: erichynds, I think thats what causes the div's not to display properly, I read the documentation on .show() and it says it that it returns the element to its previous state and by default that is "inline".
14:18  sehh: hmm
14:18  erichynds: for div's it's block
14:18  sehh: weird..
14:19  sabitertan: i hate BOM
14:19  sabitertan: :)
14:19  sehh: then I must be doing something wrong... maybe the content (which is a bunch of <p> elements) causes the display to brake

14:21  naimon: Anyone tried draggable feature on iPHone?
14:21  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/yVD27/1/ or http://jsfiddle.net/yVD27/2/ ? :)
14:22  naimon: I just tried with a basic implementation and unfortunately it doesnt work
14:22  mekwall: i guess the second is actually better, since the original html-function is only available in the overrider scope
14:31  craZZter: Hmm... I wonder if someone can give me a clue how to accomplish this the "jquery way"... I have the illustrated div-structure: http://pastebin.com/E92uDCKq

14:47  jqp: i believe so

14:59  Mr_Nobody1: yes, then i select the attribute, but how do i filter the ID name? For example, i have selected a div with ID="something3" and i need to select the matching class="othername3" using the number.

15:02  zmbmartin: when I call .dialog('destroy') it deletes the dialog but does go back to pre init state. So the form fields still have data in them?
15:02  zmbmartin: Any ideas why?

15:02  quicksilver: Mr_Nobody1: yes.

15:09  zmbmartin: No one has any ideas why .dialog("destroy") is not going to pre init state?
15:10  temp01: dialog('destroy') just removes the html created by dialog
15:10  temp01: it doesn't change the original html which might still have values etc
15:10  quicksilver: Mr_Nobody1: actually I was busy thinking of a suitably sarcastic response :P
15:10  zmbmartin: temp01: that is what I am saying it is not removing the html

15:11  mathi: temp01, thank you buddy
15:11  zmbmartin: temp01: I know it is not removing the html that dialog created
15:12  toxz: @temp01: i want to check if paramKey is of type object

15:13  mathi: isn't that the default ?
15:13  zmbmartin: temp01: any idea why?
15:13  temp01: mathi: does the form have a submit button and an action?
15:13  temp01: zmbmartin: why do you expect it to reset form field values?
15:13  Darsain: guys. regex for "word starting with letter d and containing letter s"
15:14  mathi: temp01, no
15:14  mathi: temp01, it's a jquery UI dialog, just noticed that the buttons are not inside the form
15:14  zmbmartin: temp01: I create the form in dialog. so I thought that destroy sets the page back to how the html was before I called it therefor removing the form.
15:14  mathi: temp01, how could I lsiten for enter key on a specific text field ?
15:15  quicksilver: Darsain: d[a-zA-Z]*s[a-zA-Z]*
15:15  temp01: zmbmartin: nah, it just removes the wrapper that contains the close button etc

15:22  l4rk: jchillerup: its ajax so you're going to need to assign it in the callback
15:22  jchillerup: Ah, crap. I have scope problems, then.
15:22  l4rk: $.get("/url/, function(data) { myvar = data; });
15:22  l4rk: work around them, shouldn't be hard
15:22  jchillerup: Hmm...
15:22  jchillerup: I've made the variable it writes to global

15:23  jchillerup: That's my code

15:31  Mr_Nobody: Google is failing me :-S
15:32  Mr_Nobody: No one?
15:34  jchillerup: l4rk: one thing; the get is supposed to be triggered by the user hovering over the element with the tooltip. The tooltip will then display whatever its 'bodyHandler' returns. If I put the get as the body handler, how will I then return stuff properly?
15:34  jchillerup: Mr_Nobody: Try googling javascript substring

16:17  FLX99: also, I've been thinking about using javascript maps to save each value, is there a more efficient way?
16:18  sean`: FLX99, you want it to animate
16:18  sean`: or each click change color
16:18  FLX99: click change color
16:18  koichirose: erichynds, you're right, it's stopPropagation(). Still doesn't work though, I get a "too much recursion" error

16:21  erichynds: koichirose, then stopPropagation on the link's handler, not the li's
16:22  koichirose: erichynds, true. Thanks.
16:25 --- lark is now known as l4rk
16:26  FLX99: hey sean, the problem is that it also performs the previous action
16:26  FLX99: for example: if I click once it alerts yellow
16:26  FLX99: on the second click it alerts the new color, and the yellow again
16:26  FLX99: and that's how it builds up

16:47  prgmrBill: Bertrand: wouldn't that just be a loop?
16:48  sothisisit: Is it possible to sum the width of all the images inside a div?
16:48 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 87 seconds
16:49  ablomen: sothisisit, var totalWidth = 0; $(".yourDiv img").each(function ( ) { totalWidth += $(this).width(); });
16:49  sothisisit: just like that?
16:49  sothisisit: ablomen: thanks :)
16:49  ablomen: np
16:50  sothisisit: so then  I can change the total width of other div making it equal to totalWidth right?
16:50  Bertrand: prgmrBill: you got me, what was I thinkig?
16:50  prgmrBill: haha I dunno
16:50  ablomen: sothisisit, sure
16:50  sothisisit: awesome
16:51  sothisisit: going to try it right away
16:53  kanzie: can someone good at manipulation please give me a penny on this problem. I want to add data() to a element that I then want to append to another element... cant find a clean way to solve it: http://pastebin.com/3r8mzpk1
16:54  sothisisit: ablomen: Should I do something like $(.mydiv).css("width","totalWidth"); ?

17:03  Bertrand: append the data() after the append, its operates on DOM elements
17:03  Bertrand: append the data() after the append, its operates on DOM elements
17:04  Bertrand: kanzie: ^^^^
17:04  Asone: hi
17:04  codemonkey701: why is this $(".frontpage-gallery a[href='+url+']") returning object object. it was working for me before
17:05  ablomen: codemonkey701, because that returns an object..
17:05  ablomen: it is expected
17:06  ablomen: use firebug or a similar debugger and console.log it to see more information
17:06  codemonkey701: shouldn't it return the href
17:06  ablomen: no
17:06  ablomen: $(".frontpage-gallery a[href='+url+']").attr("href"); should
17:06  kanzie: Bertrand, but if I do that it wont add data to .Box?
17:06  ablomen: but since you already know the href..
17:06  Bertrand: ?tias
17:06  bot-t: Try It And See
17:09  codemonkey701: ablomen: what im trying to do is find an A element with the url stored in the var url
17:09  ablomen: codemonkey701, yes, and the code that you just pasted returns that a element
17:10  ablomen: and that a element is wrapped in a jquery object, hence, alerting it, it shows you [object Object]
17:11  codemonkey701: oooo ok so in the code it should work but alerting it would not. hmm but the actual code isnt working though. i switched sites and it stopped
17:11  kanzie: Bertrand, yeah, didn't work at all
17:11  kanzie: hmm
17:12  Bertrand: did it attach it to .box?
17:12  ablomen: yes but there is no error in that line, so the error is somewhere else or some elements don't exist in that second site, we need an online example/the code to see what is wrong there
17:13  ablomen: anyway, time for me to start my weekend, im off
17:14  Asone: i've been trying to create an Ajax Request for an XML. usually it does work, but here i'm requesting a xml generated by a php file with modx, when i call the URL, in firebug the request statuts ends in a "OK" ( response type : 200 ), but no data loads. Does anyone could tell me why it fails how i could fix it ? sources : http://www.akbarworld.info/xmlload/xmlloadergr.html & http://www.les-graphiquants.fr/arbo.html
17:14  codemonkey701: thanks ablomen
17:14  Bertrand: is the SML well formed?
17:14  Bertrand: ***XML***
17:14  Asone: when i load it in navigator
17:14 --- coreyballou is now known as cballou
17:14  Asone: as any normal user
17:14  Asone: it works
17:14  Asone: ( the second link i gave )
17:15  Asone: but when calling it with the ajax request it says its not well-formed
17:16  mbrevda: how can I see what is happening behind the scenes when an event fires?
17:16  Bertrand: is sedning the correct headers?
17:16  Bertrand: Asone: ^^^
17:16  sothisisit: ablomen: sorry to ask again, but will something like this do the trick: $(.mydiv).css("width","totalWidth"); ?
17:16  mbrevda: I have a click event that is causing other things to fire (only on firefox), and I need to figure out how to stop it
17:17  Asone: Bertrand : seems like yes
17:17  Asone: if you have firebug you can test it
17:17  Asone: network tab
17:17  Asone: and loading the first link i gave
17:17  Asone: http://www.akbarworld.info/xmlload/xmlloadergr.html
17:17  Asone: the generated xml file : http://www.les-graphiquants.fr/arbo.html
17:18  SlexAxton: sothisisit: that won't do anything, no
17:18  SlexAxton: mbrevda: try returning false at the end of the event handler?
17:18  sothisisit: Hmm I see
17:20  mbrevda: SlexAxton:  that would be a fair test, but its impractical. My issue is : im using the scrollTo plugin. Its firing for any animation/slider on the page. Im looking for something more practical that to  return false for every single element
17:20  sothisisit: SlexAxton $(.mydiv).style.width = totalWidth ?
17:20  SlexAxton: sothisisit: nope. Is totalWidth a variable that you've defined?
17:20  sothisisit: yes
17:21  aaroncampbell: If the code is using myitem.load() to populate myitem, is there a way to hook into that and do something once it's loaded?  I can't change the existing myitem.load() line of code, so I'm wondering if I can do something like myitem.change() that works when the item changes (I know .change() is for form elements...I just don't know what else to call what I need)
17:21  SlexAxton: mbrevda: cancelling an event stops it from bubbling
17:21  SlexAxton: if there's a single handler
17:21  SlexAxton: you'd only have to do it once
17:21  mbrevda: SlexAxton: just tested - its not stoping the event
17:21  SlexAxton: sothisisit: same as your first guess, then, but without the quotes
17:21  sothisisit: oh , i was close! thx"!
17:22  SlexAxton: only on your variable though
17:22 --- yogi_ is now known as yogi
17:22  SlexAxton: the other quotes were fine
17:22  Bertrand: asone: does it have an xml element <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
17:22  sothisisit: so it gets "printed"
17:22  johnathanb: Using this form ,how can I get the contents using jQuery, on the same page without it fucking off somewhere else?
17:22  Asone: Bertrand : yes
17:22  SlexAxton: not really, but we'll go with that!
17:22  johnathanb: And it needs to use that anchor for the submit button.
17:23 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:23  SlexAxton: johnathanb: you didn't pass in a form, and dont say fuck.
17:23  SlexAxton: what is 'this form'?
17:23  johnathanb: http://pastie.org/1220986
17:23  Asone: well
17:24  Asone: it's not the same encoding
17:24  Asone: but yes, i did put a doctype
17:24  SlexAxton: johnathanb: have you tried http://api.jquery.com/serialize/ ?
17:24  Bertrand: you must have the <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> tag at the front, this is different from the header
17:24  Bertrand: but it wioll need the right version number
17:24  jMyles: Can I use .html() with multiple lines?
17:24  johnathanb: How do I make the anchor act as a submit button?
17:25  jMyles: johnathanb: .submit('form_name');
17:25  SlexAxton: johnathanb: $('#anchor').click(function(){ $('#formID').submit(); return false; })
17:25  jMyles: johnathanb, Yes, SlexAxton is right, not me
17:25  johnathanb: Ok thanks, I'll try that
17:26  SlexAxton: jMyles: multiple lines?
17:26  jMyles: SlexAxton: Yes, if I have a whole bunch of lines of html.  If I just wrap .html('loooooooooooooooootsofhtml'), it tells me I have an unterminated string literal
17:26  johnathanb: I could give you a blow job. Thank you :D
17:27  SlexAxton: that's a syntax error
17:27  SlexAxton: not a problem with html
17:27  SlexAxton: you have an extra comma
17:27  SlexAxton: err
17:27  SlexAxton: quote
17:27  SlexAxton: somewhere in your html
17:27  SlexAxton: (or a couple)
17:27  SlexAxton: johnathanb: lets keep it kind of clean
17:27  SlexAxton: plz
17:28  johnathanb: I don't make any mess ;)
17:28  johnathanb: Ok, one more thing :)
17:28  Bertrand: skanky
17:29  johnathanb: So now I have that I need to post it to a server, a server that this page is not on. How can I do it exactly? Someone was saying something about JSONP earlier but couldn't really find what I needed to do.
17:29  johnathanb: This is my first time properly using jQuery by the way. Building an iPhone app for work.
17:29  SlexAxton: put the url of that page you are trying to submit to in the action attribute
17:29  jMyles: SlexAxton: Well, if I use a single-quote to wrap the whole thing, I can then use (and only use) double-quotes in the html, right?
17:29  Asone: Bertrand : i just checked the declaration, when i use the xml file in local
17:30  johnathanb: But it needs to stay on that page, it can't go somewhere else and the server will more than likely be returning a message
17:30  Asone: i don't have any problem
17:30  Asone: but still having the problem as i use the file on the web
17:30  Bertrand: yes, but when you are using XHR it must have the tag
17:30  SlexAxton: jMyles: you can escape quotes as well
17:31  SlexAxton: "lol a \"quote\""
17:31  Asone: i must put the <?xml version=1.0" encoding-"utf-8" ?> at the beginning of my xml file, right ?
17:31  Asone: 'cause as i told you, i did it ^^"
17:31  jMyles: SlexAxton: Here's the thing: If I put the HTML on one line, it works.  But then it's unreadable.
17:32  SlexAxton: haha
17:32  SlexAxton: you can't put newlines in the middle of your strings
17:32  SlexAxton: close the string
17:32  SlexAxton: "first line" +
17:32  SlexAxton: "second line"+
17:32  karega: hey if I want to get the dimensions of the current view how do I?
17:32  SlexAxton: "third line"
17:32  sothisisit: what does this error means? get_data is not defined ?
17:33  SlexAxton: karega: the entire page, or just the viewable area?
17:33  sothisisit: I'm getting like lots of errors per second on firebug :S
17:33  Bertrand: asone: sorry, are you doing this cross domain?
17:33  aaroncampbell: If the code is using myitem.load() to populate myitem, is there a way to hook into that and do something once it's loaded?  I can't change the existing myitem.load() line of code, so I'm wondering if I can do something like myitem.change() that works when the item changes (I know .change() is for form elements...I just don't know what else to call what I need)
17:33  SlexAxton: sothisisit: it means you are accessing a property that doesn't exist
17:33  sothisisit: I see
17:33  sothisisit: need to find it then
17:34  codemonkey701: can someone help me with this. for some reason its not working http://jsfiddle.net/8BzGN/1/
17:34  codemonkey701: the animation isnt working
17:34  Asone: Bertrand : no, i just use various domains cause the xml is generated by the cmd modx on les-graphiquants.fr
17:34  Asone: and akbarworld.info is my own domain
17:35  Asone: i'm just usin' it for testing
17:35  Asone: once finished the file will be on the same domain than the generated xml file
17:35  Bertrand: one moment
17:35  SlexAxton: aaroncampbell: pass in a success function
17:36  SlexAxton: $('asdf').load('url', function(){ in here it's loaded! });
17:36  sothisisit: really strange, i've just deleted all of the changes I made and keep getting the error. Could firebug be crazy?
17:36  sothisisit: jQuery(document).ready(function($){var...et_data('browsing-page')",timeout)}});
17:37  johnathanb: Ok, I've got this.. http://pastie.org/1221034 What can I do to make it work? :)
17:37  ManxPower:  I'm trying to do iframe javascript streaming (aka forever loading iframe).  Do I have to use an http chunked response when doing that?
17:37  Bertrand: Asone: its because you are doing cross domain, you must request from the same domain or Turn off the security feature
17:37  SlexAxton: johnathanb: you've got to be more specific than that
17:38  johnathanb: It's the ajax bit, I think it's because of the cross domain thing
17:38  SlexAxton: ManxPower: no
17:38  SlexAxton: you can't do ajax cross-domain
17:38  SlexAxton: unless it supports jsonp
17:39  johnathanb: If it did support jsonp would that code be correct?
17:39  Asone: Bertrand : ok, i'll try it
17:39  SlexAxton: no
17:39  SlexAxton: johnathanb: you'd have to use
17:39  SlexAxton: GET
17:39  SlexAxton: and pass in jsonp

17:46  peterPan-: hey guys, I got question: Is there a way to preload and applet and show a waiting screen in this time? I though of blockUI, but I don't how to load the applet...via jquery. Anyone did that?
17:48  karega: SlexAxton, viewable
17:49  codemonkey701: hey guys i want to use a variable where it says variable a[href=variable] what would i say?
17:50  Bertrand: $("a[href="+varaiable+"]")
17:51  johnathanb: Ok, how would I do it with GET?
17:51  johnathanb: The same way I was doing only replace POST with GET?
17:52  SlexAxton: just remove it altogether
17:52  codemonkey701: Bertrand: thank you. My quotations were messed up
17:53  johnathanb: I need to send it but still stay on the same page, it's for an iPHone app
17:53  johnathanb: iPhone*
17:53  Kaizen: i have an extremely simple php form that executes a script that can take a long time to produce output so I want it to display a loader gif when the user presses submit, does anyone know a tutorial or easy method to achieve this?
17:53  Bertrand: show the loader before the ajaz call, then in the sucecess function of the ajax call hide the gif
17:54  mbrevda: is there any simple way to throttle ajax calls?
17:54  Bertrand: mbrevda: you want your ajax to slow down ?
17:54  mbrevda: Bertrand:I dotn want it fired more than x times in y
17:55  kanzie: Why is this giving me all children divs INCLUDING topSlideScreen? $("#selectSensors").children('div:not:(.topSlideScreen)');
17:55  Bertrand: you will need a queue to handle the ajax calls
17:56  mbrevda: Bertrand: meaning?
17:56  Bertrand: kanzie: one too many :
17:56  Bertrand: mbrevda: what is y ? time?
17:57  mbrevda: yup
17:57  kanzie: Bertrand, nopes...
17:58  johnathanb: Ok, now I got it doing everything apart from getting a result back from the page, I removed the dataType thing because no matter what it was, text, jsonp etc. it sait it was undefined.
17:58  johnathanb: said*
17:58  johnathanb: It was Chromes web inspector saying that.
17:58  Bertrand: so you need to have a queueing system that either holds new requests after x is reached with y time, or regects them... there are a few queue managers, I don't know if any handle time based though
17:58  mbrevda: hmm... anything built in to jq?

18:02  sothisisit: I don't even understand why the second time works, and not the first
18:02  sothisisit: ok
18:03  Bertrand: not time to look at now, but I suspect that you are running a script before resources are loaded, on send refresh resources are in caches and so everything happy
18:03  Seion: so IE sucks face
18:03  alpine_style: anyone know how to use validate plugin for a form with an alert box? for the life of me I can't find an example

18:10  ajpiano: also this is what your jquery file looks lilke
18:10  ajpiano: http://ajpiano.com/cap/5f9fd8.png
18:10  Seion: that jquery file is straight from the website lol
18:11  ajpiano: Seion: in case you're wondering, no one really likes debugging things where we see all the errors and teh person who is getting help is like DERP I GOT NOTHING OFFICER

18:13  serio_: you need to use html safe chars.
18:13  bung: maybe i should convert it to char entity
18:13  bung: yes
18:13  bung: ok thanks
18:13  serio_: yeah
18:13  bung: :)
18:14  Seion: ajpiano This is what mine looks like lol http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/5803/57050749.jpg but ill have to try it on some other computers
18:14 * bung slaps serio_ on the _
18:14  serio_: *twang*
18:14  serio_: (is the sound it makes)
18:14  bung: hah
18:14  ajpiano: Seion, try loading jquery and jqueryui from teh cdn http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.5/jquery-ui.min.js  http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js
18:14  bung: ok back OT before /kick
18:15  serio_: ?g html french chars @ bung
18:15  bot-t: bung, HTML Codes - Special Characters for French - ASCII Table - French ... - http://webdesign.about.com/od/localization/l/blhtmlcodes-fr.htm
18:15  Seion: ajpiano, ok thanks
18:16  ajpiano: something super funky is going on on your server cause all the jquery/jqueryui/css is being served up all wrong
18:16  bung: serio_: so even if my xml source is ISO-8859-1, i use utf-8 in my ajax call, and utf-8 in my meta tag, but it still doesnt show
18:16  serio_: yeah
18:17  bung: im not sure what the xml2json plugin is doing behind the scenes
18:17  Seion: ajpiano what about now?
18:17  serio_: even if everything is UTF-8, I still think you're going to have issues with that one character
18:18  serio_: because you're using html() funciton
18:18  bung: oh
18:18  bung: snap
18:18  bung: lmao
18:18  serio_: which assumes html safe chars (I think)
18:18  ajpiano: you have to load jquery befoer you load jquery ui seion
18:18  Seion: fixed
18:18  ajpiano: Seion you're also supposed to put scripts at the bottom of your body, and definitely AFTER your css
18:18  bung: dang, i tried .text and no luck
18:19  serio_: replace the chars, and see if it works.
18:19  ajpiano: Seion: you know what a DOCTYPE is??
18:19  bung: im adding this to my code-bhind that sends the json string, .Replace("É","&Eacute;");
18:19  serio_: just modify the script temporarity with 'montreal' or 'montr&eacute;al
18:20  Seion: ajpiano, thought scripts were suppose to be pulled in head
18:20  ajpiano: Seion: the reason it's breaking in IE is because you have a trailing comma in your object literal, line 400
18:20  serio_: lowercase r
18:20  bung: oh, in jquery?
18:20  bung: ok
18:20  ajpiano: http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/07/high_performanc_5/ Seion
18:20  serio_: I don't even know if that will work bung
18:20  ajpiano: once upon a time, scripts in the head was all good, it is no longer the case
18:21  serio_: you need to do it in the backend
18:21  Seion: lol i suck ....
18:21  bung: yea in C# it's .Replace
18:21  ajpiano: Seion: you need a DOCTYPE so this thing doesn't go into quirks mode
18:21  serio_: oh, OK
18:21  serio_: :)
18:21  ajpiano: you also know it's possible to debug scripts in IE...right?
18:22  Seion: do now :D

18:31  orolo: i need to access data that is available in a plugin outside of the plugin. so i need to get view.start from fullcalendar but i need it outside of the fullcalendar function.
18:32  KiiK: Hi. I don't know why if im using firefox and it call from Click/ timeout or whatever. it's very very slow. but if it executes directly would be very fast  **** this contains large set of data, don't open with FF, try chrome. http://jsfiddle.net/RhTuV/  (copy to local.html would be fine on FF)
18:32 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 87 seconds
18:33  ajpiano: KiiK: $("ul li").hide();
18:34  ajpiano: no reason for an .each() there
18:35  KiiK: ajpiano: hide(), addClass, .css everything is same result, slow in FF, only Firefox
18:35  ajpiano: KiiK: are there going to be lots of li coming into the page
18:35  ajpiano: or are the LI static
18:35  KiiK: lots of li
18:36  ajpiano: but all there at the beggining
18:36  ajpiano: or new ones coming in and out
18:36  ajpiano: you should probably change it to just be $("li") unless you also have ols on the page that you don't want
18:36  ajpiano: less filtering
18:36  temp01: lol ol
