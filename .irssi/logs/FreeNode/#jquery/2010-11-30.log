08:45  jamesdean77: Anyone know how to pass a var to data: in ajaxSubmit
08:46  crab: data: {var: "value", othervar: "othervalue"}
08:47  sean`: or a serialized string
08:47  sean`: ?seralize @ jamesdean77
08:47  bot-t: jamesdean77, .serialize() - Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
08:49  jamesdean77: No I want data: {RemoveRow: "defindvar"} iusing quotes makes definvar a literal
08:49  linelevel: Hi. Is there any way to change a style associated with a class, so that any element which is later added to the DOM with that class will have the new style?
08:50  jamesdean77: I have tried {RemoveRow: "{defindvar}"}
08:50  jamesdean77: I have tried {RemoveRow: \"defindvar\"}
08:50  jamesdean77: intresting
08:52  crab: jamesdean: {RemoveRow: definedvar}
08:53  jamesdean77: did that i get a error
08:53  sean`: lol
08:53  Snerf: linelevel, $('.class').css() ?
08:53  sean`: ?details @ jamesdean77
08:53  bot-t: jamesdean77, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
08:53  crab: then your var isn't defind enough
08:53  figaroo: Anyone here ever used jQuery History?
08:54  figaroo: http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-history ???
08:54  linelevel: Snerf: That only changes elements that already exist with that class.
08:54  linelevel: Snerf: I asked about changing the style associated with a class so that when I later add a new element with that class, it will get the new style.

08:55  bot-t: figaroo, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
08:55  jamesdean77: Can someone look at this simple bit of code http://pastebin.com/Hk6ikitb
08:56  jamesdean77: cant pass RemoveRow_Table to data:
08:57  Jarda: hmm... I've made a jQuery UI widget, and have the following in one of the methods: https://gist.github.com/721321 $this is just var $this = this; earlier in the code
08:57  Jarda: how can I access the widget object in _handleSearchResults
08:57  Jarda: as this in _handleSearchResult is the ajax-object
08:57  jamesdean77: Shit I see my error
08:58  jamesdean77: thanks al, I have to say you guys are very helpfull, unlike bsd devs
08:59  Jarda: I could of course refactor my code to use an anonymous function, but...
08:59  Jarda: I need the same code over and over again in my widget

09:03  Alicia_Keys: can get in the way of what I'm feeling!!!
09:03  Jarda: trying to access my jquery ui widget object in a ajax callback..
09:03  Jarda: (not anonymous, so defining var $this = this; not helping)
09:04  figaroo: sean, why use BBQ over jQuery History?
09:04  Alicia_Keys: figaroo, 'cause if I access that site, it doesn't work half of ht etime
09:04  doonie: Jarda oh noez not that again hu ;D
09:05  doonie: isn't your widgets 'global' in the jq object?
09:05  doonie: aren't*
09:05  Alicia_Keys: no, to be honest, I haven't used jQuery History that much, so I can't give a fair perspective.. I can say however, that BBQ fits in all your needs
09:05  Jarda: I'll try to refactor this to a show case
09:05  OhaiBBQ: too many highlights
09:05  doonie: there is no sean! err spoon
09:06  figaroo: Alicia_Keys, what site?
09:06  figaroo: Btw, are you really Alicia Keys?
09:06  Alicia_Keys: figaroo, the 'no' was ment to retract that (was a joke, misplaced perhaps)
09:06  Alicia_Keys: And yes, I am Alicia Keys

09:07  figaroo: And, I'm confused, which site were you talking about that you can't access?
09:08  linelevel: From my searching, I can't find any way to change the properties of a CSS class (not of the objects which currently have that class, but of all objects that will ever have that class). Is this really impossible?
09:08  Jarda: doonie: https://gist.github.com/721330 this is kidna what I have
09:09  doonie: gtg to meeting ;\ sean help out darn stripper *kicks in nuts*
09:09  Alicia_Keys: figaroo, I'm not a nerd, I'm a web opener
09:09  Alicia_Keys: figaroo, forget that site statement
09:10  figaroo: Can I still call you sean?
09:10  Jarda: hrrr. I'm gonna hurt myself soon..
09:12  Alicia_Keys: Jarda, que paso?
09:12  Alicia_Keys: figaroo, you can call me Mr Jones
09:13  Jarda: Alicia_Keys: how to access my widget object when in a ajax callback (the situation in my gist)
09:13  Alicia_Keys: Jarda, live demo? jsfiddle?
09:13  Jarda: Alicia_Keys: isn't my gist enough?
09:13  Jarda: there's nothing that acts wierd.
09:13  Alicia_Keys: Not for Alicia Keys it isn't
09:14  Alicia_Keys: ?caching @ Jarda
09:14  bot-t: Jarda, Even when you're creating a jQuery object out of an element you'll just be using once, you should always cache. Otherwhise you won't end up in heaven. http://blog.seankoole.com/qotd-why-should-you-cache-when-using-jquery
09:14  Alicia_Keys: first of all, cache
09:18  alcuadrado: Jarda, I would tipically solve that with an object or closure
09:18  figaroo: Mr Jones, you starting to sound like a guy I know...
09:18  Alicia_Keys: seconf od all, you want to you find _handleSearchResult
09:18  Jarda: I'm trying to avoid writing function(data) { $this._handleSearchResult(data); } over and over again
09:18  Alicia_Keys: Jarda,

09:21  sean`: you want access to the object in baz?

09:21  JKarsrud: it's bass, not baz :P

09:22  Jarda: ok, thanks
09:24  figaroo: sean` I don't get BBQ
09:24  OhaiBBQ: too many highlights
09:24  figaroo: what's the equivalent $.History.bind(function...) for BBQ?
09:24  OhaiBBQ: ;[
09:25  sean`: lol
09:25  bot-t: bbq bbq bbq bbq bbq bbq
09:25  sean`: tel ben_alman to change his plugin name
09:25  OhaiBBQ: llol
09:26  JKarsrud: why? I like it
09:28  figaroo: yeah, why change the name?
09:28  OhaiBBQ: because bbq highlights me
09:28  Third3ye: Hello there =) How do I prevent a .load from showing before certain effects are finished, and then showing with a transition effect?
09:28  JKarsrud: lol
09:28  JKarsrud: then you're doing it wrong :P
09:28  JKarsrud: Third3ye: Use the animation's callbacks?
09:29  sean`: So, I was at this BBQ the other day
09:29  JKarsrud: this back button & query ?
09:30  sean`: haha
09:30  OhaiBBQ: yesterday at school i met this guy named sean`
09:30  JKarsrud: Ooh, I'm gonna be so geeky this summer

09:31  sean`: figaroo, you're not getting the jokes
09:32  JKarsrud: Third3ye: Do you have some code for us?
09:32  Third3ye: Oh indeed :)
09:32  Third3ye: Tried some callback, but apparently I'm doing it wrong :S
09:32  JKarsrud: Just like OhaiBBQ! ;)

09:37  JKarsrud: lol, didn't recognize you there trisox :)
09:37  JKarsrud: Third3ye: any luck?
09:37  Third3ye: Nope
09:38  Third3ye: I tried adding a function() to the append, and taking the append out of the fadeOut, and removing the function() from that one as well
09:38  trisox: On my android phone going to work now :p
09:38  trisox: Jkar how your doing?

09:39  JKarsrud: Doing my regular #jquery channel hour :P
09:39  Third3ye: ^
09:39  Third3ye: ^^
09:41  Third3ye: What's that supposed to do, JKarsrud ?
09:41  sean`: JKarsrud, that your code?
09:41  JKarsrud: nope
09:41  Third3ye: It's mine with two # signs in it ^^;
09:41  sean`: ok
09:42  JKarsrud: well, pastebin said "use ## to highlight" :P
09:42  sean`: It's bad man
09:42  sean`: You should cache Third3ye
09:42  JKarsrud: That he should. But did my small fix work Third3ye?
09:42  JKarsrud: without the ## :P
09:42  Third3ye: Yes it did, JKarsrud ^^
09:42  JKarsrud: if it works, we'll help you clean it up :)
09:43  Third3ye: What did you do anyways?
09:43  JKarsrud: Great. append doesn't take a callback, so I moved your #loader.load-function to the line below your append, and removed the callback :)
09:43  JKarsrud: If you compare the two, you'll see it :)
09:45  figaroo: sean`: I'm trying out BBQ, and one thing that seems to stand out from jQuery History is that when I refresh the page with a hash, the hashchange event doesn't fire
09:46  JKarsrud: Third3ye: Now if you'll cache your selectors and stuff, your code will be better! :o
09:46  OhaiBBQ: figaroo, you'll need to trigger it yourself
09:46  Third3ye: Oh ok
09:46  OhaiBBQ: it technically shouldnt fire because the hash doesnt change
09:47  Third3ye: Just some tutorial that said it had to be uncached to work
09:47  stiang: what’s the name of that plugin that emulates the zoom effect of the mac os x dock?
09:47  Third3ye: that was in .ajax though, which is what I suspect we're talking about...
09:47  JKarsrud: Third3ye: Not the selectors :)
09:47  JKarsrud: var loader = $('#loader') etc
09:47  Third3ye: Ah I see, I should use variables more ^^;;
09:48  JKarsrud: yeah
09:48  Cork: stiang: are you thinking about fisheye?
09:48  OhaiBBQ: Third3ye, fisheye?
09:48  OhaiBBQ: er meant stiang
09:48  Third3ye: OhaiBBQ: No, it's glass
09:48  Third3ye: :P
09:48  JKarsrud: you only use your selectors once here, but it's good practice either way, because that way you only query the DOM once, instead of each time a selector is called
09:49  Cork: stiang: http://marcgrabanski.com/articles/fisheye-javascript-menu
09:49  JKarsrud: ?caching

09:50  sean`: figaroo, hashchange is a browser event
09:50  sean`: has nothing to do with bbq
09:51  OhaiBBQ: browser events and i are like this
09:51 * OhaiBBQ holds his arms out
09:52  Third3ye: Ok, so to clarify things, if I add var empty = .one('click', function() {$(this).val("");}); I just add $(sample).empty(); ?
09:52 --- kiu1 is now known as markube
09:52  OhaiBBQ: ok, i'll admit, that was really lame
09:52  sean`: it was
09:53  OhaiBBQ: lol
09:53  figaroo: hmm, is there a way to prevent the browser from moving down to the element that has the same id as in the hash fragment?
10:00  figaroo: Anyone know?
10:00  ravenzz: what?
10:01  timing: return false upon click
10:01  timing: or e.prevenDEfault(0
10:01  timing: then it won't jump to that hash fragment
10:01  Third3ye: e.preventDefault is the superior solution
10:02  figaroo: preventDefault in which onclick? I'm talking about when a page is loaded with the hash
10:02  ravenzz: demo
10:02  ravenzz: :?
10:03  figaroo: I don't have a demo, because it's in the admin area of a site
10:03  Third3ye: How about setting the viewport position to the top
10:03  Third3ye: Not sure how you do that :/
10:03  ravenzz: jsfiddle.net can you reproduce that piece of code?
10:04  figaroo: but let's say you have a page with an element with the id of foobar, and then you enter the page url with #foobar at the end of the entire url, what happens is the page loads but also jumps to element foobar
10:04  ravenzz: oh
10:04  figaroo: I could just manually do a window.scrollTo(0,0);
10:06  figaroo: actually that doesn't seem to work either.
10:06  Third3ye: Ah, so I can't just add functions, i also have to add $(this).functionsToCome
10:06  LearnerJq: if a dom element of class="foo" is replaced with another dom element with the same class="foo" via .html() method, so the DOM will consider to have two elements with class="foo" or just one
10:07  ravenzz: figaroo the jump happens before the document is ready(and generally before javascript runs) so you really cant stop it
10:07  Third3ye: How do I make this: .one('click', function() { $(this).val(""); }); // in to a variable?
10:07  AndChat: Jump?
10:08  ravenzz: "jump"
10:09  Third3ye: I'm kind of stumped, as I don't know how to call the variable after a selector, like $("input[name=email]").clearInput();
10:09  Third3ye: or would that be declaring a function, not a variable..
10:09  Third3ye: hmm
10:09  Third3ye: Silly me
10:09  ravenzz: btw you can edit or remove the name attr
10:09  ravenzz: if you dont need it
10:10  ravenzz: or move to the top on document ready

10:13  JKarsrud: Cache your selectors, not your event bindings :)
10:17  Third3ye: It's not a generic event, JKarsrud
10:17  Third3ye: It's to be used twice, on two different inputs, with two different sets of functions
10:17  JKarsrud: Okay, then I don't understand you
10:18  AndChat: ;)
10:18 --- AndChat is now known as trisox
10:19  Third3ye: Well I got these two inputs and I got this line on both of them (.one('click', function() { $(this).val(""); });) -- I might reuse this function again
10:20  ajpiano: Third3ye, you need to make a "jQuery Plugin"
10:20  Third3ye: jquery extend?
10:20  ajpiano: jQuery.fn.yourThingy = function() { return this.each(function() { $(this).one("click",function() { $(this).val("");  });  });  };
10:21  JKarsrud: Third3ye: Aha, I see. Then ajpiano is right, make a plugin for it :)
10:21  trisox: He always is..
10:21  JKarsrud: I know

10:45  jedmund: Hi guys, anyone around? I'm having a problem with jCrop. I am trying to make it so that the user can enable/disable the jCrop plugin and have the selection persist. If you click on the "Content" button on http://dev.getfoundation.com/admin/projects/edit?p=1 you'll be able to play around with the implementation
10:45  jedmund: and here is the relevant javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/5xNpW/
10:46  jedmund: the problem is that, whenever it reloads the selection, it is scaling and moving it around, so it loads something, but its not what you first input

10:51  Cork: JoelE: no
10:52  Cork: JoelE: except the tiny cost of creating several scopes
10:52  Cork: (but every time you create a function you get that)
10:52  JoelE: ok thnx
10:54  JKarsrud: jedmund: Can you in some way store the top left corner coordinates, plus width and height of the mask?
10:56  JKarsrud: jedmund: So that if the user disables it, you still have the coordinates etc. of the cropping mask
10:56  jedmund: yeah, i'm storing them in hidden inputs
10:57  jedmund: the problem is that the box and coords are scaling when I re-init the plugin
10:57  jedmund: and im not 100% sure why

10:57 --- Trisox is now known as Trisox[atwork]
10:57  BG_: Does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem? I need to send the page location from javascript to the server using AJAX. The problem is that in IE and Firefox the URL retrieved from "location.href" is already encoded (so non-latin characters become %D7 etc..) - but on Safari they remain untouched! So if I encode the URL, it gets double-encoded on IE/FF. Help...?
10:59  JKarsrud: jedmund: No idea really
11:00  Cork: BG_: what about location.host + location.pathname ?
11:00  BG_: Cork - let me check that
11:01  jedmund: i think i got it
11:01  BG_: Cork - same
11:01  Cork: BG_: then it means thats the url the browser uses
11:01  Cork: BG_: what does it matter?
11:02  BG_: let's say the url is http://a.com/à (this is a non-latin character). the server will get different inputs from IE and Safari for the same url...
11:03  JKarsrud: jedmund: great :)
11:03  Cork: BG_: ya, but the browser should handle that
11:03  BG_: http://a.com/%D7%90
11:03  BG_: that's the encoded form
11:03  Cork: BG_: the browser shouldn't ever send à to the server
11:03  BG_: I store the result in the database
11:04  Cork: BG_: all none us characters should always be encoded in the url, as its not safe to use those
11:04  BG_: since safari doesn't encode location.href, I have to encode it manually, which results in it being encoded twice in IE/FF
11:06  BG_: I guess I could do decodeURI(location.href) and then encode the result
11:07  doonie: booya
11:07  doonie: hi corkie
11:07  BG_: but I'm not sure how it will behave on safari, since I'm decoding an already decoded string...

11:12  JKarsrud: eni23: Anyway, ui draggable only restricts movement on the x and y axis in the. Browsers controlling your mouse is a dangerous thing
11:15  eni23: ﻿JKarsrud: ﻿Cork: there is mabye another way: change the real mouse-cursor to an transparent image and move an fake-cursor. but it doesen't work really great
11:15  JKarsrud: eni23: hell no!

11:30  eni23: damn, i think it's really not possible to prevent mouse from moving with js only (should be possible with an java-applet, but this is not cool). i don't get it why, i mean cmon it's possible to read local files with js but not moving the mouse?
11:34  eni23: should be possible would be really great for some graphical applications
11:34  PointMan: umm
11:34  PointMan: why would you need to move the mouse?
11:34  PointMan: doesnt sound like great UI
11:35  JKarsrud: eni23: Why would you want to do it in the first place?
11:35  oodavid: when animating, is there a nice plugin that lets you smoothly change direction? If I run stop ().animate it tends to be jumpy...

11:39  Superman_: how to disable the keydown event on any textarea??
11:41  Cork: Superman_: $('textarea').live('keydown', function(event) { event.preventDefault() });
11:41  Cork: hmm you might have to catch all of them, not sure
11:41  Cork: Superman_: $('textarea').live('keydown keyup keypress', function(event) { event.preventDefault() });
11:41  Superman_: ok so I want to make it happen after 10 digits for example
11:42  Superman_: so I'll just count the text and in if condition put this code right?
11:42  Cork: Superman_: keydown is a tricky plack to check the input
11:42  Cork: as the value haven't entered the field yet
11:42  Superman_: hmm
11:42  Superman_: so what should i go for
11:43  Cork: but you could do something like $('textarea').live('keydown', function(event) { if($(this).val().lenght > 10) event.preventDefault();  });
11:43  Cork: (no garantee it will work though
11:43  Cork: )

11:44  dr_traktor: Hi. Is there a way to pass a function with an argument to .click without messing up? My problem is, that the argument is passed as a reference - I guess - but by the time the click even happens it doesn't hold the value I wanted.
11:49  coldhead: ?p @ dr_traktor
11:49  bot-t: dr_traktor, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
11:49  coldhead: let's have a look what you got already?
11:49  dr_traktor: Okay, I will write something.
11:52  dr_traktor: coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/mx23N/
11:54  dr_traktor: Okay, I updated it since I don't know if you can automatically see that.
11:54  dr_traktor: The idea would be to display a specific number to a div when it's clicked.
11:55  coldhead: dr_traktor: http://jsfiddle.net/mx23N/3/
11:55  coldhead: you can't start an id with a digit
11:55  dr_traktor: I know, I updated it since.
11:55  dr_traktor: http://jsfiddle.net/mx23N/2/
11:55  coldhead: and you can use this to find the clicked element
11:56  dr_traktor: This also shows that I don't want to display exactly the id of the element.
11:56  yunosh: hi, in jquery mobile, how do you overwrite the default options of a widget? i want the iconpos for a certain navbar widget to be "notext" instead of the default "top".
11:56  dr_traktor: coldhead: Now I can extract the data I need with string manipulation it just won't be so nice.
11:57  coldhead: dr_traktor: http://jsfiddle.net/mx23N/4/
11:57  coldhead: something like that?
11:57  coldhead: ?eval 'div_93'.match(/\d+/)[1]
11:57  bot-t: coldhead: undefined
11:57  coldhead: ?eval 'div_93'.match(/\d+/)[0]
11:57  bot-t: coldhead: "93"
11:57  dr_traktor: Yes, well if you say that's the only way I have to go with that.
11:58  coldhead: thats as clean as i can do it but its my first day using jQuery
11:58  coldhead: if you want to store JUST the digit and not attach it to the id you could use data()
11:58  coldhead: ?data @ dr_traktor
11:58  bot-t: dr_traktor, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
11:58  dr_traktor: Ill take a look.
11:58  coldhead: or if you just want to the know the position of the element there is index()

12:03  hokapoka: When sending json to the server I'm using EncodeURIComponent for the entire JSON.  but I need to escape the JSON properties.  for example : { "prop":"some value with \" chars in"} does Jquery have an escape function that will escape any chars that might cause issues in JSON when deserialized on the server.
12:03  hokapoka: Althought I can only think of the " char causing issues, there might be others.  Rather use a method that handles the escaping that I can rely on rather than using my own simple regexop that might miss somthing.
12:06  dr_traktor: coldhead: .data() works fine. I like it more than string manipulation. Thanks for the tip.
12:06  coldhead: no problem, dr_traktor!
12:07  dr_traktor: I guess nothing bad happens when I delete an object that has data associated to it, right?
12:07  coldhead: i believe the data is literally attached to the object, so it should disappear too

12:54  JKarsrud: lvh: hey
12:55  doonie: JKarsrud ya weird that he didn't look for it
12:55  lvh: Is there a way in jQuery UI to make sliders and progress bars have different CSS themes?
12:55  lvh: In a dialog, I would like the title to meld into the content
12:55  doonie: using iframes ;D
12:55  doonie: maybe some master class
12:55  lvh: (The text styling there will be enough to make it stand out)
12:55  doonie: haven't treied
12:55  doonie: tried
12:56  lvh: However, sliders use headers for the 'highlighted' area and progress bars use headers for the completed area
12:56  lvh: so if I make them meld in, the progress bar effectively becomes completely useless
12:56  JKarsrud: lvh: Try hooking it up with some more specific selectors in your classes
12:56  JKarsrud: uhm
12:56  JKarsrud: stylesheet
12:56  lvh: JKarsrud: I fixed the problem yesterday by the way, still using google's stuff
12:56  JKarsrud: nice
12:56  lvh: Just downloaded it again and tried that
12:56  lvh: still no idea what the hell went wrong
12:57  JKarsrud: no, me neither, weird problem. Glad you fixed it :)
12:57  JKarsrud: lvh: you know the scoring of different kinds of selectors in css?
12:57  lvh: I'd rather know why it's broken tbh :-p
12:57  lvh: JKarsrud: Yep
12:57  lvh: JKarsrud: In fact I wish I knew less advanced CSS so I would stop being angry at IE so much
12:58  lvh: Actually maybe I should move some of this stuff to jQuery
12:58  lvh: (I have crude hacks because I needed :last-child)
12:58  JKarsrud: okay. how about you hook on to the classes of the slider/progressbar and override them in your own stylesheet by making it more specific?
12:58  lvh: yep, sounds good
12:58  lvh: Just wondering if there was a jQ UI specific method, but it looks like everything is Just CSS

13:01  JKarsrud: It should, not 100% sure tho

14:37  impi: my site is here: and a normal scrollbar works...but as soon as i apply n jquery function to it, it fails: http://www.micket.me/micket-white
14:39  JAAulde: Hi everyone. I have a greasemonkey script running on a page w/ jQuery. When U run the body of the script in my Firebug console, it works perfectly.

14:47  coops89: how can I trigger a jquery ui event?
14:48  coops89: e.g. I want to trigger the "slide" event on an initialized slider widget
14:48  Pawka: try $('#blah').slider('slide');
14:48  Pawka: of course slider must be initialized before.
14:49  Cork: no that will call the function slide in the plugin
14:49  Cork: if you want to trigger the events use the normal .trigger
14:49  Pawka: oh ok.
14:52  coops89: i'm tying $("#slider").trigger("slide")
14:52  coops89: but it doesn't work
14:52  coops89: does the "widgetEventPrefix" has anything to do with it?
14:54  Cork: coops89: what exact is it you want to trigger?
14:54  coops89: the slide event
14:55  Cork: coops89: you want trigger your own code or things thats part of the plugin?
14:55  coops89: Cork
14:55  coops89: my own event
14:55  Cork: slide isn't correct
14:55  Cork: is it the ui slider your diffeling with?
14:55  coops89: I think you had to prefix jquery ui event's when triggering them, but I'm not sure
14:56  coops89: like "slide_slide" or something
14:56  coops89: Cork: yes.
14:56  Cork: let me check for a min, it looks like slider doesn't use prefixes
14:56  Cork: oh, so it does (the documentation sucks again...)
14:57  Cork: the event is trigger('slideslide');
14:57  jetienne: q. is there a way to generate a unique dom ID by jquery ?
14:59  coops89: Cork: just tried slideslide, didn't work :P
14:59  coops89: and like 6 variations of it
14:59  Cork: coops89: thats strange thats what the code says it should be
15:00  Cork: coops89: $.widget("ui.slider", $.ui.mouse, { widgetEventPrefix: "slide",
15:00  coops89: $(e).slider({   ...   });  (e).trigger("slideslide");
15:00  coops89: didn't work :/
15:00  Cork: so that means it SHOULD be slide+event_name == slideslide
15:01  Cork: coops89: no not on e
15:01  Cork: on your element
15:01  Cork: $(this).trigger('slideslide');
15:01  erichynds: do you have any handlers bound to the event?
15:02  Cork: hopefully, else it would be farly pointless trying to trigger them :)
15:02  coops89: that's $(e).trigger ... btw
15:02  coops89: yes ofc..
15:02  coops89: :P
15:02  coops89: $(this) ?  but my slider is in $(e)
15:02  Cork: k
15:02  Hishi[Revo]: YoH. Im using .show and .hide to make a dropdown menu to appear/disappear on mouseover and mouseout but obviously it wont persist if i mouseover the submenu. any ide how i make the menu persist if i mouseover the submenu? using a ul to make the menu frame
15:03  Cork: normally e is the event object :)
15:03  ohst: is there anyway to avoid a timeout in a situation like this http://pastie.org/1335308
15:03  coops89: ah, e is an element in my case :)
15:03  coops89: $(slider).slider({ min: min,       max: max,    value: value, slide: function (event, ui) {  ...   } });   $(slider).trigger("slideslide");
15:04  Consolas: thyphus thanks buddy
15:04  coops89: doesn't trigger slide!
15:04  Consolas: guess it is something like that yeah! thanks sorry about the delay
15:04  thyphus: Consolas: no problem
15:04  Cork: and your doing $(slider).trigger('slideslide'); ?

15:05  thyphus: Consolas: http://jsfiddle.net/GVRqS/
15:05  coops89: just after initializing it
15:05  erichynds: you have to use the bind syntax coops89
15:05  erichynds: there is nothing bound to that event.  it is a callback when using that syntax
15:05  coops89: I'm binding in the initializer that makes the slider.
15:05  coops89: as you can see
15:05  coops89: slide: function (event, ui) { ... }
15:06  erichynds: as i said, that is a callback fn, not a binding to the event
15:06  SeriousJonny: hmm
15:06  SeriousJonny: what boxes you check
15:06  SeriousJonny: to make jquery code pass in jlint?
15:06  coops89: erichynds: it's an event callback?
15:06  erichynds: 1 sec
15:07  coops89: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#event-slide
15:07  Cork: coops89: wait a min
15:07  Cork: coops89: your adding slide inside your init
15:07  erichynds: coops89, http://jsfiddle.net/mpL9u/
15:07  Cork: thats not an event listner
15:08  erichynds: trigger will only fire handlers that were bound to the event itself
15:09  Cork: ya, callbacks only work from inside the plugin
15:11 --- unCork[home] is now known as Guest84278
15:12  coops89: so I can't trigger the slide event manually? well that sucks
15:12  Cork: coops89: you can if you bind it instead of giving it as a callback
15:12  Cork: the callback isn't really an event
15:13  Cork: its just a callback the factory calls before it triggers the event
15:13  anli_: Weird, in all my $.post result handlers, the resulting webpage has begun to be included with an extra newline
15:13  anli_: Why?
15:13  Cork: anli_: your editor?
15:13  anli_: Its ajax results
15:14  Cork: anli_: there is nothing in the jquery or xhr that adds new lines
15:14  anli_: Wonder then if php adds them
15:14  Cork: so its either your editor or your server
15:14  anli_: I wish firebug could give me some hex
15:14  Consolas: thanks!:)
15:14  anli_: It seems that json works as it should however
15:15  anli_: Ah, must be an include that adds the newline
15:15  jetienne: q. is there a way to generate a unique dom ID by jquery ?
15:16  Consolas: guys: speaking of json, its bad to have an ajax getting a result from a query into "normal" html, and they just replace that in the "div".responseText ? Without using any json
15:16 --- gat is now known as gat|away
15:17 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
15:17  erichynds: jetienne, new Date().getTime() will give you a somewhat uniquish timestamp
15:17  anli_: Consolas: I am not sure how you mean
15:18  anli_: unless you do that twice in a row
15:18  jetienne: erichynds: not very clean. but i got the point
15:18  jetienne: erichynds: thx
15:18  anli_: You can always get an id from a db insertion
15:19  Consolas: anli_: lets say you want to sort a table right? but not just the "visible" part (you have paging). So you want to sort all the table according to name, etc.
15:19  Consolas: Should I use json? I am trying to implement a somewhat "general" ajax controller
15:19  Consolas: So I just receive the "field" I want to sort and the order, and then send that info to a general php controller
15:20  Consolas: this way I can have multiple different tables
15:20  Consolas: and the sort "function" is implemented to all
15:20  anli_: I would sort on server side, maybe thats far from what you are asking
15:20  Consolas: server side? what do you mean?
15:20  anli_: That the php that generates the table data also do the sort
15:20  Consolas: When I execute the query, Im executing it with some sorting parameters of course
15:21  anli_: Or whatever you use on the server
15:21  ||cw: Consolas: that's how most of the table/grid plugins works
15:21  Consolas: oh yeah sure
15:21  anli_: ah
15:21  Consolas: yeah of course
15:21  anli_: Maybe I am not the right person to answer
15:21  Consolas: but if the user changes the field to sort, I have the ajax to refresh the table
15:21  Consolas: ehehhe either way thanks for the help and attention anli_
15:21  ||cw: yup
15:22  Consolas: ||cw hum...table/grid plugin? gonna check that out. is there one already implement?
15:22  Consolas: in jquery? with fancy stuff?
15:22  Consolas: eheh
15:22  Consolas: that I can easilly insert ajax/ph to fit my needs?
15:23  ||cw: there's like 50
15:23  ||cw: and of course, i didn't like any of them, so i wrote my own, so now 51
15:23  ||cw: mine doens't do paging though
15:24  ||cw: what mine does do is advanced cell formating and group headers and footers
15:25  anli_: Why use plugins for something easy as tables
15:25  ||cw: anli_: easy re-usability
15:25  anli_: yeah, but yagin
15:25  anli_: yagni
15:25  anli_: I maent
15:26  anli_: cant spell
15:26  anli_: need a spell plugin
15:26  ||cw: also some MVC
15:26  ||cw: i like to separate my layout, logic, and data
15:26  anli_: reusability is overrated
15:26  anli_: usability in itself underrated
15:27  ||cw: sorry, but you fail a programmer
15:27  Consolas: ||cw same here, mvc
15:27  Wizek: hi there
15:27  Consolas: anli_ it is not overrated.
15:27  Consolas: just sometimes
15:27  Consolas: eheh
15:28  ||cw: I wrote it for 1 table, then expanded that to cover 3 more similar cases, then used it for another not so similar and it's saved me about a week of coding already
15:28  ||cw: and I have about 20 more to do
15:28  Wizek: How do I get an element with jQuery which has an id of "bar.foo"? or elements that has class of "foo#baz"?
15:28  ||cw: I have most of the bugs worked out now too, so the rest will be cake
15:28  Consolas: ||cw where can I check out those tables / grids plugins? jquery.ui ?
15:29  ||cw: Wizek: foo\.bar
15:29  ||cw: Consolas: there's a list on the plugins section on the site, or just google "jquery grid" or "jquery table"
15:29  Consolas: thank you
15:29  erichynds: ?escaping @ Wizek
15:29  bot-t: Wizek, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
15:30  ||cw: whoops, \\
15:30  Wizek: ||cw: $('div#foo\.bar') gets interpreted as a a div which has foo ID and class of bar.
15:31  Wizek: ||cw: oh, it actually works, thanks
15:32  Consolas: this one datables.net seems awesome
15:33  coops89: any firebug user here that happens to know how to break at a line programatically (e.g. using console.break() etc)
15:33  erichynds: coops89, toss the "debugger" statement in there
15:34  coops89: erichynds: nice, thx

15:38  erichynds: no
15:38  thyphus: greedo .click() is no condition
15:38  thyphus: it's a trigger
15:38  lee__: is there a way to have a sortable <ul> where you can drop the <li> anywhere below the list, container doesnt work when u have connected lists
15:38  greedo: hmm
15:38  jomofcw: Hello =)
15:39  greedo: so then maybe the trigger and then nest the condition check
15:39  thyphus: greedo yes
15:39  erichynds: greedo, plus that css call returns a jquery object that'll always be true
15:40  erichynds: if you want to check if the height is 75, do height() === 75
15:40  greedo: ah

15:54  ||cw: libertiy: or .css()
15:54  libertiy: just addClass thanks thats simple
15:55  libertiy: and how about removing a class?
15:55  erichynds: put them in your stylesheet and keep CSS/JS separate
15:55  libertiy: is that possible also?
15:55  erichynds: removeClass
15:55  ||cw: guess
15:55  greedo: i guess i forgot a ) somewhere

15:57  ner0x: Also, is it unheard of to put the validation and error reporting in the DBIC resultsource?
15:57  ||cw: binni: try creating the button with document.createElement('button') and append that
15:57  freedgy: Hi everyone. I made an image carousel using .animate() to slide the images left and right. I'm using some large jpegs, like 950x560 - compressed down to under 100kb each. On newer computers the carousel moves nice and smooth. On older machines, the images jitter and become jagged during movement. Any ideas how I can make it run smoother on these older comps?
15:58  ner0x: Ignore that last question. For another channel.
15:59  ||cw: freedgy: moving large images smoothly requires some cpu/gpu power
16:00  binni: ||cw: the resulting button from that doesn't seam to be themed, but it's a bit small so I could be wrong.

16:33  gkatsev: isn't it the same thing, really?
16:34  ||cw: is it?
16:35  ||cw: not looked it up, but i assumed the difference was the $.function() fired when jquery was ready and $(document).ready(function()) fired whr the DOM document is ready
16:35  gkatsev: ||cw: could be, but I thought they both fired when DOM is ready, along with window.onload
16:36  RTPMatt_: they are the same
16:37  RTPMatt_: All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:
16:37  RTPMatt_:     * $(document).ready(handler)
16:37  RTPMatt_:     * $().ready(handler) (this is not recommended)
16:37  RTPMatt_:     * $(handler)

16:39  gkatsev: what is the difference exactly?
16:39  ||cw: read the link?
16:40  markj: window.onload waits for all resources to be ready
16:40  markj: document ready waits for the dom only
16:40  gkatsev: oh, so, document ready is like putting the script at the end of the body tag, good to know.
16:42  gkatsev: that like should probably mention that specifically. The difference between the two

17:00  formasfunction: 4lld3bt5publ1c
17:00  halcyon1234: http://jsfiddle.net/MQSeh/3/   Still being fiddly with the checkbox. I tried adding in .stopPropogation().
17:00  RTPMatt_: halcyon1234: so are you wanting it to work no matter if they hit the checkbox or the text?
17:00  formasfunction: Well, there's that. Sorry. Anyway, had a bug I wanted to run by you guys just to make sure I'm not crazy and to see if there's a workaround: http://formasfunction.com/jquery_bug/
17:01  halcyon1234: RTPMatt: That's the hope.
17:01  halcyon1234: =)
17:01  RTPMatt_: halcyon1234: you have 1 checkbox, but 2 TDs w/ text, should they both check the same box?
17:02  halcyon1234: Yes. Clicking anywhere on the row should do it. (I might be adding other controls later, but only the one check box)
17:06  davetarmac: Anyone used easytooltip.js before?
17:06  RTPMatt_: halcyon1234: the problem you are having is that when they actually click the checkbox, the event bubbles up to the $("#tblSelect tr").click and the checkbox gets doubleclicked.  You could fix it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/MQSeh/5/
17:06  fourmi-1: davetarmac : your are injecting php code on the cleint side ! you are tring to do some magic !
17:07  davetarmac: fourmi-1: hmm - this is a very good point
17:07  davetarmac: how can I get that variable from PHP in to the JS?
17:07  fourmi-1: ajax
17:07  squeeks: json.
17:08  davetarmac: is it a small script?
17:08  fourmi-1: read on : api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
17:09  fris: what's the namespace for functions in javascript in the page, if I wanted to wrap it I want to do: oldfn = document.functionname; document.functionname = function(args) { something; oldfn(args) }
17:10  TimothyA: is there a jquery plugin or some kind of other way to implement psuedo-selectors cross-browser?
17:10  TimothyA: e.g. first-line and such
17:12  MrNibbles: sean`:  i decided that i didnt like that rotate script by the way
17:13  sean`: COOL
17:13  MrNibbles: it has to store a rotation reference as a data attribute
17:13  libertiy: ok thanks guys i do like         $this->view->books = $books->fetchAll("book_id = '7'"); and i get the descriptions of all the books
17:13  MrNibbles: stuck with my silly regex parse :S
17:13  halcyon1234: Thanks, RTPMatt, that's great!
17:13  RTPMatt_: sure thing
17:13  libertiy: it just looks for all ids with a 7 in it i guess
17:13  libertiy: i would need it to be really just "7"
17:13  TimothyA: I'm pretty sure I saw a jquery plugin around that would read the stylesheet and apply the pseudo-selectors to the document regardless of browser
17:14  deploy: There's an <img> on my page and its src attribute is being changed by script I have no control over. Is there any way I can bind a callback that will run whenever the src is changed?
17:15  RTPMatt_: deploy: you might be able to do like$(img).load(function()...) to catch it
17:16  deploy: "might"?
17:17  RTPMatt_: yes, you can: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
17:17  FinalAngel: is there a updated version like jquery classy available or an equivalent?
17:21  kalees: hi
17:22  JKarsrud: FinalAngel: What is this jquery classy?
17:22  kalees: does anyone using webspere application server 6.1 to run the jquery application?
17:22  deploy: RTPMatt_: Thanks, but nothing happening: $('#lightboxImage').load(function() { console.log('asdasdasda'); });
17:23  Kindari|work: Hey guys. How can I retrieve from the url a section name? link page.html#section
17:24  FinalAngel: JKarsrud: an object orientated approach in writing jquery
17:24  JKarsrud: like classy query?
17:25  Know1edge1: whats the best way to get a child by index id?
17:25  Know1edge1: for example 3rd child
17:26  FinalAngel: yes exactly
17:26  RTPMatt_: deploy: I just tried it and it worked for me, are you sure you selected the image correctly?  are you sure you bound you .load AFTER the IMG tag was in the DOM, but BEFORE the src on your image was changed?
17:28  davetarmac: ok, been redirected here from #javascript with my problem. I've managed to get the variable passing from php to javascript and assigned it a variable, but it's still not working
17:28  deploy: RTPMatt_: Well, the DOM should be ready. Do I misunderstand? Is this a one off event or will it fire any time the src is changed?
17:30  FinalAngel: found one, moo4q looks cool
17:30  serio: davetarmac, <script type='text/javascript'><?php echo 'var my_var = "woohoo";'; ?></script> ???
17:30  RTPMatt_: deploy: it should happen every time, but if the other code on the page is changing the src before you bind that event, you wont be able to catch it
17:30  serio: ?p @ davetarmac

17:31  DZer00ne: Hello, could anybody help me with this please, I'm new to javascript and I had form validation on a contact form (jQuery) and now I've also added ajax for submiting the form... the ajax part works just fine but the validation isn't done anymore, here is the link: http://pastebin.com/53kM6x54
17:31  DZer00ne: Thanks.
17:31  hokapoka: argh... I can never find any decent icons.  Any reccomendations?
17:31  serio: silk?
17:31 --- RJD22 is now known as RJD22|away
17:31  DZer00ne: what type of icons do you need?
17:31  davetarmac: https://gist.github.com/4adbb682e873f8f503da
17:31  serio: ?g silk icons fam fam @ hokapoka
17:31  davetarmac: serio: ^^
17:31  bot-t: hokapoka, famfamfam.com: Silk Icons - http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/
17:31  hokapoka: DZer00ne: w/o looking at it I woudl suggest you were using the onsubmit evet,
17:32  hokapoka: ohh. serio many thanks.
17:32  sean`: slik
17:32  DZer00ne: yes, the validation was done on clicking the submit button
17:32  DZer00ne: hokapoka, for really nice icons, you could try this http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/icons/
17:32  hokapoka: DZer00ne: yes there's an evet on a html <from> onsubmit that's probably triggering the validation
17:33  deploy: RTPMatt_: Oddness. To help clarify, the other code is a lightbox plugin. I need to bind my own events whenever the image is changed. Trying to do it by watching the src attr of the image the lightbox uses. But as I said Im getting nothing out of .load() when I click next/prev/ etc. I'll keep trying. Thanks.
17:33  hokapoka: damn keyboard.  s/evet/event
17:33  DZer00ne: hokapoka, can you please tell me what I need to change in that code? I am new to this, what I have achieved so far was trough tutorials :)
17:33  serio: davetarmac, are you familiar with js debug tools?
17:34  hokapoka: As you're now using XHR to post the form to the server the onsubmit event will not be triggered, so you need to trigger it via the click event.
17:34  RTPMatt_: deploy: are you sure you are selecting the image properly?  Are you sure they are just changing the src, and not the entire image tag?
17:34  DZer00ne: so what you mean is I need to add an onclick event to the button (sorry if I'm off, but like I said, Im new) :)
17:34  deploy: RTPMatt_: Yep to both.
17:35  davetarmac: serio: nein
17:36  RTPMatt_: deploy: well, sorry, unless you have an example somewhere, there is not much else i can do to help at this point
17:36  hokapoka: DZer00ne: I've never used the jquery validate plugin.
17:36  serio: so, the top part where your javascriptvar is in one set of <script> tags
17:36  deploy: RTPMatt_: NVM! Just explained to my boss what I was doing and he says hes throwing out the problematic lighbox soon so problem avoided! Thanks.
17:36  serio: why are you using a second set directly below it?
17:37  RTPMatt_: well, there you go
17:37  rubydiamond: hi guys.. I want to implement a patter which shows locations listed on the left side ... upon selecting from the left side .. it adds in the right section
17:37  serio: why not just echo the number inside the *div.hidden-* string?
17:37  rubydiamond: do you guys know some good example or jquery library for that
17:38  DZer00ne: anybody else could help me with my problem then?
17:39  hokapoka: DZer00ne: it appears friom reading the docs you need to just call the $("#contact").validate( function(){ /* do your submiot */ } );
17:39  hokapoka: from the click event of the button.
17:40  DZer00ne: any idea as to what I have to write in the onclick event?
17:40  hokapoka: what you have now, but wrap it with what I just typed
17:40  hokapoka: replace the /* do your.. */ with your current on click handler logic
17:42  hokapoka: serio: many thanks, the silk icons are great.
17:42  DZer00ne: could you please write the code in a pastebin? I'm kinda lost :) I'd be grateful

17:52  SeriousJonny: hmm
17:52  SeriousJonny: how do you make continuous scroll seo friendly
17:52  SeriousJonny: bookmark seo
17:53  prgmrBill: did you just glue together a bunch of buzzwords and attempt to form a question?
17:53  SeriousJonny: since servers doesn't get url fragments
17:54  SeriousJonny: is there a way to serve bots and users same content with the same url
17:54  prgmrBill: sure, just make the "more" link something like ?startAt=18
17:54  SeriousJonny: but on a heavy ajax frontend
17:54  prgmrBill: if you have JS, then the link auto loads that content
17:54  prgmrBill: if not you click the link and see the same results
17:54  SeriousJonny: yes but
17:54  SeriousJonny: non js has pagination
17:55  SeriousJonny: js has infinite scroll
17:55  prgmrBill: yeah and?
17:55  SeriousJonny: assume someone like to share that link
17:55  SeriousJonny: hmm
17:55  prgmrBill: did you miss what the ?startAt does?
17:55  SeriousJonny: no
17:55  SeriousJonny: i get it what you say
17:56  SeriousJonny: could just hide the paginator
17:56  SeriousJonny: on js
17:56  SeriousJonny: and use its values
17:56  prgmrBill: right
17:56  SeriousJonny: to fetch next content
17:56  SeriousJonny: but again
17:56  SeriousJonny: bookmark
17:56  ||cw: SeriousJonny: you can detect useragent serverside ...
17:56  SeriousJonny: i know
17:56  SeriousJonny: redirect bots to static content?
17:57  ||cw: no, just service it instead
17:57  SeriousJonny: what has useragent todo with this :D
17:57  ||cw: if the useragent is known to not support js, serve the full list, else serve a pagnated one
17:58  SeriousJonny: this is called cloaking :D

17:58  RTPMatt_: what do you do for people who don't have javascript turned on?  The search engine will basically see that.  people should not _need_ javascript so neither should a search spider
17:58  SeriousJonny: i did allrdy

17:59  lvh: Hi
17:59  lvh: Is there something like jquery ui's modal dialog box that just displays a div/section?
18:00  lvh: jquery ui's dialog appears to want to do everything using spans and classes
18:00  SeriousJonny: what i could do is a share this site button and hope that the user doesnt copy paste url
18:00  SeriousJonny: since 1page layout where url doesnt change
18:01  lvh: I can already produce a pretty looking form of the right size that uses the right markup (ie a heading is actually h1, etc), I just want to display it in the middle of the page with a lightbox.
18:01  SnackWhack: I'm using legacy code, and I have a form with a submit button in it. The form has no id or name, nor does the button. I can't modify the baseline code, but I can reference jQuery. How can I change the text of the button on that form? I think I need to reference $('form:first')., or document.forms[0], but I'm not sure about the syntax. Can anyone help? Thanks
18:02  ||cw: SnackWhack: sounds right.  try it?
18:02  SnackWhack: ||cw: try what? How do I reference the submit buttons text?
18:02  Consolas: hello again my friends
18:03  SnackWhack: document.forms[0].button[0] ?
18:03  DZer00ne: anybody? Please... I really need to finish this.
18:03  Consolas: guys, regarding the stuff asked before, what tag can I get to send info to the jquery functino from an href? I mean I have href with the link, title and class used up. I was thinking of sending the ifno using the name tag, but the href link starts messing up
18:04  ||cw: SnackWhack: maybe $('form:first > input:submit') ?
18:04  SnackWhack: will try
18:04  RTPMatt_: $('button').text('Some other text')
18:05  SnackWhack: ||cw: Ah, I found a working example: $(this).find(":submit").attr('value','Saved!');
18:05  ||cw: well, a sumbit buttom to me implies it's not a button, but an imput
18:05  ||cw: SnackWhack: assimung this is the form, should do it
18:06  SnackWhack: ||cw: I tried this: $('form:first > input:submit').attr('value','2!'); < didn't work

18:06  SnackWhack: then again, I just realized, there are 2 forms. One in the header for searching

18:07  SnackWhack: ||cw: form.last worked... can I set that to an index? like form[1]...
18:08  cpass: is this a help channel
18:08  ||cw: nth I think, you should probably read the selectors section of the docs
18:08  ||cw: cpass: aren't most all freenode channels?
18:08  SeriousJonny: here is an example what i have so far, if agent.bot or no js server static content.. if js able fetch stuff per json
18:08  SeriousJonny: http://cenk.shake.cc/jsd/index.php
18:08  SeriousJonny: but now i dont know how should i make this seo friendly
18:09  cpass: well im not a frequent user so i really wouldnt know that
18:09  Brodingo: so im trying to get the index of an element with the class active within a collection of elements with the class ajax-request
18:10  SeriousJonny: i used a meta refresh on header its valid w3c to pass users with nojs into a static content
18:10  SnackWhack: so I guess that's my question... if I have multiple forms on a page, how can I select one in the middle? There must be a way to reference by index...
18:10  SeriousJonny: bots gets content with 0 js
18:10  Brodingo: but i have 1.3.2 and cant use index(selector)
18:10  SeriousJonny: forms[0]?
18:11  cpass: so what is the proper way to return json encoded data to form fields?
18:11  monkeynut: ?serialise
18:11  SnackWhack: $('form:last > input:submit').attr('value','My New Text'); changes to $('form[1] > input:submit').attr('value','My New Text'); ???
18:11  bot-t: monkeynut, .serialize() - Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
18:11  ||cw: SnackWhack: did you lookup the 'nth' selector?
18:11  SnackWhack: lemme look it up
18:12  SeriousJonny: the js version was form[index]
18:12  SeriousJonny: as far as i remember
18:13  SnackWhack: got it, thanks!
18:13  SnackWhack: $('form:nth-child(2) > input:submit').attr('value','My New Text');

20:41  Schalk: For example have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/eUeRH/
20:42  b-lew: hummm
20:42  Schalk: In Chrome this will always be true if (xmlHttp.status != 200) { because it returns a 0 and not 200

20:49  b1lly: ajpiano: so basically all I do is make a php $array = {'dog' => 'sparky', 'age' => '24'}; and than json_encode($array); and than on the return i just use (data.dog)
20:49  Schalk: Oh I see the bug is against 1.4.4 however, the version of jQuery this fails against is 1.4.2 but, as stated, this happens when using plain JavaScript as well

20:58  SlexAxton: FBLikeButton_: no, i was just searching google
20:59  ajpiano: FBLikeButton_: SlexAxton is the James Carville of the FB Like Button, which, for this analogy, is Bill Clinton
20:59  SlexAxton: that would do it, but you'd need to set a height
20:59  SlexAxton: based on other params you pass
21:00  delinquentme: this line : $('.save_cancel_button_down').delay(1000).attr("value", "Saved!");  is syntactically correct right?
21:00  FBLikeButton_: ajpiano, sadly no idea who James Carville is  but SlexAxton is my new best friend = )
21:00  JRGould: ajpiano: Wait.. so SlexAxton did not have sex with that like button... or he didn't inhale the like button?
21:00  ajpiano: FBLikeButton_: he's the bald-headed southern gentleman who talks real loud and does politcal commentary, he gained nationwide fame advising bill clinton's 1992 campaign
21:00  ajpiano: therefore

21:29  Nicolas_Leonidas: is there a quick fix that would make it work?
21:29  Ryro: right, its closing because you follow a link and it reloads the page, and the menu is closed again what you could do is have a function that opens the appropriate menu based on which page you are on

21:29  b1lly: is there a way in firebug to see where my jquery errors are
21:29  b1lly: or get an error log

21:52  ajpiano: panfist: which autocomplete callback are you using
21:52  panfist: the problem is i'm not sure how to hook into an event that occurs after autocomplete does everything it's going to do
21:52  ajpiano: you should use "change" probably
21:52  panfist: i have tried select, change and close
21:52  khmer: dilvie: seriously :)
21:52  Lumpio-: berakwhat
21:52  Lumpio-: Speak English

21:55  khmer: so do you guys dislike $() as a shortcut for $(document).ready() because it makes $() seem more like Everything()?

21:55 --- frigginWork is now known as seutje
21:55  ajpiano: khmer: a) yes, kinda, and b) the only time it acts like that is when you pass a function
21:56  dilvie: .ready() spells it out.
21:56  ajpiano: khmer: whereas the thing you just proposed works when you pass a string
21:56  ajpiano: which is how a lot of OTHER things work in jquery too
21:56  ajpiano: so it would add even more parsing and shit to that
21:56  ||cw: I dislike things that are non-deterministic
21:56  ||cw: 'this' even bugs me sometimes
21:56  ajpiano: so at least with $(function(){}) you're doing some overloading based on type
21:56  dilvie: llcw: you're in the wrong place.
21:57  ajpiano: whereas with $("url") it's string parsing city
21:57  ||cw: necessary evil
21:57  josheee12: hi guys.
21:57  khmer: ajpiano: i see
21:58  dilvie: llcw: jquery = contextual determination, not non-determination. =)
21:58  khmer: ajpiano: but on the other hand, $() parses strings for their intent--are they selectors, or html?
21:58  ajpiano: khmer: right, that's why i'm saying adding more string parsing to determine more intent
21:58  ajpiano: and this one , that doesn't have to do with elements at all
21:58  josheee12: i'm using draggable to make a div draggable.  is there a way to make a div inside it /not/ draggable, but leave the surrounding area draggable, so the outer region acts as a "handle" for the inner?
21:58  khmer: ajpiano: having used yui a lot, and prototype in the distant past, i already think of jquery as "the library that has a switching station"
21:58  ajpiano: khmer: it saves the developer 3 or four characters, and adds a boatload of junk to core
21:59  rwaldron: khmer, imagine adding a layer of regex to determine if that string is a url cc @ajpiano
21:59  khmer: rwaldron: granted
21:59  ajpiano: or imagine
21:59  ajpiano: $("<a href="http://www.google.com">")
21:59  rwaldron: khmer, but this one doesnt know if its going be a url, because it cant actually rely on http:// whatever
21:59  khmer: no, i thought about it more and i realize it's a dumb idea for other reasons, not the least of which is that it would be the only asynchronous mode of $() and that's always totally crappy
21:59  rwaldron: $('/uh/oh/')
21:59  serio: ?eval $("<a href="http://www.google.com">")
21:59  ajpiano: do i want to make an anchor? do i want to do ajax?  do i want to create an anchor and then immediately ajax it?
21:59  bot-t: serio: SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
21:59  serio: :(
21:59  ajpiano: WHO KNOWS
21:59  serio: you done fucked up yer quotes
22:00  khmer: yeah i hear you
22:00  ajpiano: serio: YOU DUN GOOFED
22:00  serio: :D
22:00  serio: deserves a re-watch
22:00  khmer: i mean YUI 3 doesn't even use the same function for all selector queries
22:00  khmer: you gotta use Y.all() or Y.one()
22:00  serio: REPROCUSSIONS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!
22:00 * serio still wonders what that means
22:00  rwaldron: khmer, prototype: $() $$()
22:00  khmer: so my mind is, sort of roughly, trying to travel in the direction of centralizing functionality
22:01  rwaldron: $A()
22:01  khmer: rwaldron: zactly
22:01  rwaldron: $R()
22:01  rwaldron: barf
22:01  serio: wait, he said consequences.
22:01  sac: also mootools has several
22:01  rwaldron: btw, those last two dont count in that last
22:01  rwaldron: list*
22:01  khmer: so already jquery says "just give it to $()" and so my inexperienced mind stumbles in that direction
22:02  serio: ajpiano, you remember that font-resizing script you helped me out with?
22:02  khmer: but i get it...$() really is for the DOM
22:02  sac: i used mootools full time for two years on a big project until two months ago, and then i moved onto another project that uses jquery, i just gotta say i like how jquery keeps to certain things and is more consistent
22:02  rwaldron: khmer, as long as you never come off like an ungrateful retard, someone will always e willing to explain stuff to you
22:02  ajpiano: serio, uh, vaguely
22:02  serio: I'm gonna build a bunch of stupid shit like that and roll it into a plugin called 'stupid client requests'
22:02  ajpiano: lol
22:02  ajpiano: nice
22:02  serio: it's gonna have everything
22:02  serio: a print button
22:02  ajpiano: you should make a package
22:03  serio: font-resizer
22:03  ajpiano: for people to download
22:03  ajpiano: jQuery Plugins For Managers

22:03  carlosleon: serio: and should have some tweaks for making buttons seem like facebook ones :D

22:04  JKarsrud: $.fn.makeMyLogoBiggerCream();
22:04  khmer: $.fn.putDashesInTheWordsWebsiteAndEmail();
22:04  carlosleon: serio: lol
22:04  ajpiano: khmer: i still put a dash in e-mail
22:04  ajpiano: because "email" is a shade of green
22:04  rwaldron: serio, ajpiano, $.fn.makeSeoFriendly()
22:04  rwaldron: managers will love that shit
22:04  sac: oh but one thing i liked more about mootools was that if something didn't quite do what i wanted it was easier to extend the functionality, in jquery everything inside is scoped so tight
22:04  Brodingo: $.fn.synergize();
22:05  rwaldron: sac, thats because mootools is shit
22:05  ajpiano: lol
22:05  rwaldron: just sayin
22:05  ajpiano: $.fn.leverage
22:05  dwarder: what does this mean: $('[value=""]',event.target).remove();
22:05  dwarder: i dont understand this square brackets

22:05  khmer: $.fn.buySXSWibadge
22:06  rwaldron: web 2.0 is awesome
22:06  b1lly: if i wanted to make $('.class').html = $('.class').html + "more" is there a way to do that?
22:06  sac: for example there's a very very specific bug in jquery UI Mouse which breaks a certain type of sortable, but it's so specific that i don't even bother reporting it, so every time i update my jquery ui i just manually modify it :P
22:06  rwaldron: because marketing dipshits STILL go to conferences for it
22:06  serio: carlosleon, this channel is logged, I can always dig through the archives.
22:06  rwaldron: and AJAX
22:06  dwarder: when will web 3.0 out?
22:06  serio: when I have time.
22:06  sac: in mootools i could just have a file that extends the mouse which does the fix
22:06  Ryro: $('.class').html('some html' + someotherstuff);
22:06  rwaldron: i dont think developers go AJAX conferences anymore
22:06  carlosleon: $.harassEmployees();

22:07  rwaldron: i wish

22:07  dwarder: eww
22:07  erichynds: carlosleon, i think you mean $.sexuallyHarassEmployees()
22:07  sac: rwaldron, no i don't, but i wish i had :(
22:07  rwaldron: j/k i kinda love my job
22:07  rwaldron: fuck days off
22:07  rwaldron: days off are boring
22:07  khmer: yeah, my employer has released a set of REST APIs
22:08  serio: lol at raptorize!
22:08  serio: Brodingo, I did it with the konami code

22:09  b1lly: ok append dont really work :o
22:09  sac: serio, using it for the same purpose as json, oh yes it's shit

22:10  khmer: the joke is that ultimately our REST API will consist of a single method

22:16  Schalk: Any ideas why for success the xhr and textStatus is undefined?
22:16  khmer: function isThisJavascript() {return eval('isThisJavascript()')}
22:16  Schalk: Ah ok
22:16  erichynds: Schalk, jsonp is not an xhr request
22:16  erichynds: unless it's on the same domain
22:16  Schalk: So for jsonp it does not populate those two arguments
22:17  jedimind: fuck you know it's a slow day when you get sidetracked by reading bash.org for almost a full hour
22:17  alcuadrado: Schalk, what you mean by "returned" is passed :p
22:18 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 120 seconds
22:18  Schalk: <alcuadrado> - Where did I say that?
22:18  Schalk: only be return if an exception was trapped - this?
22:18  alcuadrado:  According to the documentation when a success callback is run it is *returned* three arguments
22:18  Schalk: sure, it should be passed
22:19  alcuadrado: and there too
22:19  alcuadrado: =)
22:19  Schalk: my bad
22:19  alcuadrado: that should be documented more clearly
22:19 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
22:20  Schalk: So let me get this straight, for jsonp calls that are cross domain the xhr and textStatus will not be populated
22:20  Schalk: But if it is same domain or not jsonp, they will be
22:20  ajpiano: Schalk: yep
22:21  Schalk: sweet
22:21  dilvie: is NaN falsey?
22:21  alcuadrado: jsonp is almost always used for cross domain ajax (maybe in jquery always) as you can't do xhr to different domains
22:21  serio: ?tias @ dilvie
22:21  bot-t: dilvie, Try It And See
22:21  Schalk: <alcuadrado> - sure, agree
22:21  alcuadrado: so as no xhr object is used, you don't get it in the callback
22:21  Schalk: Guess the docs needs to be updated to more clearly reflect this
22:21  erichynds: ?eval !!NaN
22:21  bot-t: erichynds: false
22:22  alcuadrado: I agree with that Schalk
22:22  dilvie: erichynds: Thanks. =)
22:22  Schalk: Do I log a 'bug' and make the suggestion?
22:22  ajpiano: what
22:22  khmer: typeof NaN == "number" though
22:22  khmer: that always pissed me off
22:22  ajpiano: Schalk, you can file a ticket yes
22:22  Schalk: regarding an update to the documentation
22:22  ajpiano: i'll fix it up whe n you're ready
22:22  Schalk: cool
22:22  l4rk: khmer: so is 0 and its falsly
22:22  l4rk: whats your point
22:23  l4rk: other than it makes no sense :-p
22:23  panfist: but 0 is a number?
22:23  khmer: l4rk: yeah that's my goddamn point
22:23  khmer: what does the first "N" stand for
22:23  l4rk: Sorry i don't use the n word
22:23  panfist: how does typeof 0 == "number" not make sense? it makes perfect sense
22:23  khmer: haha

22:24  panfist: yeah but the js definition of Infinity is not the same as the mathematical definition of infinity
22:24  carlosleon: hahaha
22:24  carlosleon: gregglind: jquery tools
22:25  dilvie: panfist: Not a Number == number?
22:25  dilvie: I think that's a little confusing. =)

22:25  bot-t: serio: "number"
22:25  panfist: i agree
22:25  alcuadrado: what would be the type of NaN if not number? "wtf"?
22:26  ||cw: as it should be
22:26  gregglind: carlosleon, very fancy, I like it.
22:26  dilvie: alcuadrado: Yes.
22:26  panfist: none? null?
22:26  panfist: undefined?
22:26  serio: it's because of where NaN comes from that it's type is set as such.
22:26  alcuadrado: but it is not null, it's a NaN
22:26  panfist: how about undefined
22:26  ||cw: null is NaN
22:26  alcuadrado: imagine doing 3 / 0 == undefined? WTF :P
22:26  ||cw: but only in a number type'd var
22:26  khmer: ?eval typeof null
22:26  bot-t: khmer: "object"
22:27  carlosleon: gregglind: there's another one but I can not remember its name because I didn't like it :P

22:27  alcuadrado: panfist, you are right =$

22:51  Schalk: caught = correct ;D
22:51  alcuadrado: :)
22:51  Xinil: If I have a .change(function(){alert('test');}) on a checkbox set...why is it not executed when I do .attr('checked',true) somehow else on that particular checkbox?
22:52  Xinil: somewhere else* rather
22:52  Schalk: Ok, if you remove the &jsoncallback=? bit from the URL it does call the error callback
22:52  alcuadrado: oh, I think that I have read that when using jsonp you loose erros controll
22:53  Schalk: Geez ok, is there some way one can confirm this?
22:53  Schalk: Because I see errorThrown = undefined
22:53  Schalk: textStatus does equal error though
22:53  erichynds: Xinil, try just trigger("change")
22:54  serio: I don't understand trigger( 'change' );
22:54  serio: can't you just call .change() ?
22:54  alcuadrado: I'm googling it
22:54  Xinil: erichynds: instead of .attr('checked') you mean?
22:54  Ryro: if the box is already checked when you call it it wont trigger change
22:54  Schalk: And the xhr.status is now 0
22:55  Ryro: .attr('checked', true)
22:55  erichynds: Xinil, yeah
22:55  serio: ?checkboxes
22:55  bot-t: To set a checkbox to checked, do .attr("checked","checked"). To uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked"). To check if it's checked or not: .is(":checked");
22:55  ||cw: serio: you can, which will then call .trigger('change') for you
22:55  serio: but, in this case, since you're already binding change
22:55  serio: just call it.

22:57  jamesdean77: Can someone explain why a function is auto calleded on pahe load when writen like this funcname(), but without () function is not auto called ?
22:57  alcuadrado: Schalk, "First and foremost, there is no error handling for JSONP calls" from: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/
22:58  erichynds: jamesdean77, because () executes the function
22:58  ||cw: Xinil: .change() with no argument is, however, a replacement for .trigger('change')
22:58  Xinil: Serio: ah, I udnerstand what you're saying now :) .change() is synonymous with calling .trigger('change')
22:58  erichynds: otherwise it's just a reference to the function
22:58  Xinil: ||cw: yeah, just figured that out
22:58  gz0: how can I create dynamic variables, I've tried eval() but I keep getting the error "missing ; before statement", thanks
22:58  serio: yeah, it's just a matter of preference as to which you use.
22:59  alcuadrado: gz0, please, don't use eval
22:59  erichynds: gz0 scope them to an object
22:59  Xinil: cool, thanks again guys
22:59  serio: but, that could change.
22:59  serio: GET IT?
22:59  erichynds: xz0 like var foo = {}; foo[ someDynamicName ] = "bar";
23:00  alcuadrado: gz0, yot can read this, it'll help you a looooooooot: http://11heavens.com/everything-is-a-property-of-an-object-in-javascript
23:00 --- sab_ is now known as sab
23:00  Schalk: ok, so for jsonp on success xhr and textStatus will be undefined and for error, maybe because something in the URL is wrong, the only thing set will be the status value on the xhr Object and a textStatus of error
23:01  gz0: erichynds: I thought that was kinda ugly, but ill do it that way
23:01  alcuadrado: Schalk, I think the error callback wouln't be executed saddly
23:01  Schalk: Actually no, that is not entirely correct
23:01  erichynds: gz0 better than eval
23:01  ajpiano: Schalk, jsonp also doesn't fire an error handler in jquery
23:02  erichynds: and better than a random global variable
23:02  ajpiano: you have to use the jquery-jsonp plugin
23:02  Schalk: The error calback will only be calledif one removes the &jsoncallback=? bit
23:02  gz0: ya
23:02  gz0: thx
23:02  gz0: alot for the help
23:02  ajpiano: Schalk, we know that
23:02  jamesdean77: @eichynds I get that, whats the differance when calling a function like funcname() and just funcname
23:02  Schalk: Else it will simply silently fail and not call success or error
23:02  ajpiano: Schalk, there is a pending rewrite of the ajax module that fixes a lot of the weird shit around JSONP
23:02  Schalk: Sounds awesome
23:02  ajpiano: yeah
23:03  alcuadrado: jamesdean77, In javascript functions are firs-class citicens, so by calling it without the parens you can asign it to a variable
23:03  Schalk: <ajpiano> - I am just thinking in terms of the current documentation it would probably clear up a lot of confusion for current users of the API
23:03  delinquentme: So i've got an interesting situation with regards to " .click() " ... so im trying to get a function to activate when someone interacts with a <textarea> ... now the click within it works properly ... however i'd also like the function to fire when text is pasted into the <textarea> .. im assuming i need a replacement for " .click() " ... something that activates whenever a click OR a paste happens ... thoughts anyone?
23:03  erichynds: jamesdean77, just funcname doesn't call the function.  funcname can be passed to methods that'll call it automatically - so like .bind("click", functionname)
23:03  erichynds: that only works because bind fires the function for you
23:03  Schalk: If one made the differences with JSON-P clearer
23:03  jamesdean77: Outstanding answers poeple thank you
23:04  rightnow|away: Anyone know how to (using jquery.validation) putting a input to validated = false using a external js function?
23:04  alcuadrado: I agree with Schalk, it is missdocumented
23:04  serio: ajpiano, fuuuck, nobody ever told me about the non error shit with jsonp
23:04  Schalk: <alcuadrado>, <ajpiano> - you agree?
23:04  serio: back when I was trippin' about that shit.
23:05  jamesdean77: So, funcname in "var funcname" is only called when a the var is called
23:05  erichynds: ?101 @ jamesdean77
23:05  bot-t: jamesdean77, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
23:05  alcuadrado: I don't get you... var functname would define a variable with the same name that a function :s
23:06  Schalk: <ajpiano> - Is the no error handling aspect of JSON-P a jQuery thing or a JSON-P limitation?
23:06  DAElectric_: anyone got a work around for nest sortables?
23:06  ajpiano: it's a jsonp limitation basically, but julian figured out how to make it work
23:06  ajpiano: Schalk, where do you think the docs need to be improve
23:06  alcuadrado: ajpiano, It should be clarified
23:07  alcuadrado: nothing is said about the diferences about JSonp specific behaviour
23:07  ajpiano: i really?
23:07  ajpiano: are you guys looking at the docs, you promise??
23:07  Schalk: Well basically where it states what is passed to the error and success callbacks. And there probably needs to be a note that clearly states the fact that if an error occurs with a JSON-P call, it will silently fail and neither the success nor the error callbacks will be called
23:07  alcuadrado: and although it's JSONP's matter and non jquery spesifc, it's important
23:07  DAElectric_: anyone have a work around for nested sortables issues in IE.
23:07  ajpiano: http://ajpiano.com/cap/81dcf0.png
23:08  ajpiano: it does need to state explicitly that there is no error callback for jsonp, i'll add that
23:08  alcuadrado: wait a minute
23:08  alcuadrado: something is said
23:08  alcuadrado: the structure of the doc is the problem
23:08  alcuadrado: it is at a separate place
23:08  Schalk: Here is the 'bug' - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7666
23:09  Schalk: The comment needs to be removed or edited though, as it is not 100% accurate.
23:09  ajpiano: yeah

23:30  peekaboo: Why doesn'y apache compile my jquerry?
23:30  alcuadrado: rightnow|away, if you make a jsfiddle isolating the error, an example of what you want, or your actual progress, your chances to recieve help would really increase
23:30  peekaboo: It compiles my javascript and php just fine
23:30  ajpiano: peekaboo apache doesn't compile jquery
23:30  peekaboo: ajpiano: what?
23:30  ajpiano: no one has a clue of what you're talking about
23:30  peekaboo: Does it use an interpreter?
23:30  ajpiano: wtf
23:30  ajpiano: jquery runs in the browser
23:30  ajpiano: it has nothing to do with apach
23:30  peekaboo: Apache serves the web pages ajpiano
23:31  ajpiano: hooo boy
23:31  peekaboo: It has EVERYTHING to do wit it
23:31  ajpiano: peekaboo:
23:31  ajpiano: i have actual work to do
23:31  ajpiano: someone else can take this one from here
23:31  alcuadrado: hehe
23:31  alcuadrado: peekaboo
23:31  alcuadrado: what are you triying to do?
23:31  peekaboo: Make my site work
23:31  alcuadrado: I think you are just missunderstanding who HTTP and the web works
23:31  alcuadrado: so, what are you using jquery for?
23:32  peekaboo: Getting data from my database
23:32  alcuadrado: what? :|
23:32  ajpiano: peekaboo: are you trolling
23:32  alcuadrado: with jquery?
23:32  janthony: Is jQuery UI easy to pick up?
23:32  ajpiano: janthony: it's like othello
23:32  ajpiano: a minute to learn, a lifetime to master
23:33  janthony: ajpiano: Ahhh. I'm going to be doing some stuff in WordPress for a plugin, which uses jQuery UI. I may just try and tap into the drag and drop setup they have already built in and recycle their code.
23:34  janthony: I'm basically going to make a sorting function. Allows you to sort items by drag and drop.
23:34  ajpiano: there's a jquery ui sortable ...
23:34  alcuadrado: that should be trivial
23:34  janthony: Stores the values of the sorted items in the db as well of course.
23:35  janthony: Yeah, I figured that would be pretty entry level, which is why I'm not too concerned about it.
23:36  janthony: Man, I switched to drinking Tea while at work instead of Pop, and it seems like I have to take a bio every 45-60 mins now
23:37  coldhead: bio?
23:37  janthony: bio break, restroom break. :P
23:37  peekaboo: Is there a module I need for apache to compile jquery?
23:38  ajpiano: peekaboo, are you seriously not joking
23:38  alcuadrado: mod_jq_db_handler
23:38  PaulB: thank you guys
23:38  alcuadrado: ajpiano, he must be trolling
23:39  ajpiano: peekaboo: jquery is a javascript library, it does not need to "compiled" by apache, and it does not get things from the database unless you use a server.
23:39  ajpiano: alcuadrado, i know
23:41  Schalk: ajpiano - Wrote a small post about this here : http://espressive.tumblr.com/post/2052477733/a-small-gotcha-with-ajax-and-jsonp
23:41  ajpiano: Schalk: and i added it to the docs
23:41  ajpiano: :)
23:42  r3negade: hey all, i'm trying to modify a plugin, i'm wondering where I went wrong this this line:
23:42  r3negade: $(myitm + "img").attr({"href" : $(myitm + "img").attr("longdesc")});
23:43  Schalk: Awesome, thanks so much
23:43  alcuadrado: great Schalk
23:43  r3negade: will I need to do like a foreach or something?
23:44  ajpiano: ?concatobj @ r3negade
23:44  bot-t: r3negade, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
23:44  r3negade: ahh.
23:44  r3negade: thx
23:45  ajpiano: r3negade, you can do .attr("href",function(i,href) { return $(this).attr("longdesc");  }
23:45  ajpiano: that will implicitly iterate and set the property
23:45  r3negade: thanks :)
23:45  Schalk: cheers everyone
23:46  dtelepathy: Hello, we have created several jQuery plugins that seem to have been restricted from the jQuery plugin directory with no notification.
23:46  dtelepathy: May someone please assist me?
23:46  eTiger13: dtelepathy: restricted as in removed?
23:47  dtelepathy: We have 4 plugins, (SlideDeck) that were all active
23:47  eTiger13: man i hope squaretrade is as good as ive heard otherwise ive just wasted $33
23:47 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
23:47  dtelepathy: They are viewable when I login, but Access Restricted when not logged in
23:47  eTiger13: ?slidedeck
23:47  dtelepathy: And another developer has hijacked our trademark
23:47  bot-t: eTiger13, slidedeck | jQuery Plugins - DESCRIPTION http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/slidedeck
23:47  coldhead: dtelepathy: don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to server troubles
23:47  dtelepathy: Correct
23:47  dtelepathy: That's not us
23:47  dtelepathy: http://SlideDeck.com
23:47  dtelepathy: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/SlideDeck
23:47  dtelepathy: That's us
23:47  dtelepathy: Which is now restricted
23:48  coldhead: i think that site is being upgraded, dtelepathy
23:48  rocket: newbie question: how can I shorten this -> http://pastebin.com/HBZEUaZN
23:49  dtelepathy: What do you mean upgraded?
23:49  ajpiano: dtelepathy: the plugins state is kind of in a state of flux, shall we say
23:49 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
23:49  dtelepathy: As in, the directory is slightly borken?
23:49  coldhead: exactly
23:49  ajpiano: slightly is putting it lightly
23:49  dtelepathy: Any idea when this will be resolved?
23:49  ajpiano: dtelepathy: the future
23:49  eTiger13: when we get around to it?
23:49  ajpiano: :/
23:50  coldhead: hobs, please fix plugins.jquery.com, thx
23:50 --- sab is now known as Guest86526
23:50  dtelepathy: The plugin that shows up at this link: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/slidedeck
23:50  dtelepathy: is highjacking our brand
23:50  dtelepathy: which is rights protected
23:50  dtelepathy: Should I file an abuse ticket?
23:50  coldhead: dtelepathy: is this about your brand or access to your plugin?
23:50  coldhead: or both?
23:50  ajpiano: uhh
23:50  coldhead: you can host the plugin yourself
23:51  dtelepathy: We do host the plugin ourselves
23:51  Ryro: $(this).parents('.ui-jqgrid-view').find('.ui-jqgrid-bdiv table').trigger('reloadGrid');
23:51  coldhead: oh good
23:51  ajpiano: i thinkit's about the fact some other dude put something else at his page
23:51  coldhead: ?cc
23:51  bot-t: CASE CLOASED >: |
23:51  dtelepathy: we like the visibility that jQuery's directory provides
23:51  dtelepathy: and when search for the problem, I found this plugin (as recently as a few hours ago)
23:51  dtelepathy: so to answer your previous question, both
23:51  hobs: coldhead: I would love to
23:51  hobs: remember the plguin issues thing I told you about
23:51  Brodingo: that paintbrush
23:51  hobs: it isnt fixed yet last time I checked
23:51  Brodingo: on their website
23:51  coldhead: jquery's directory makes me think a plugin is cursed. i only use plugins that aren't in the directory
23:51  coldhead: sup Brodingo
23:52  eTiger13: hobs: what issues?
23:52  Brodingo: lol they doggin slidedeck on their site
23:52  Brodingo: sup coldhead
23:52  hobs: eTiger13: its an admin of the plugin site issue, but it loads every name of every user in the assign to list
23:52  Brodingo: oh shi, gotta go to Trudy's YUM YAY BYE
23:52  hobs: so it takes 30 seconds to 4 minutes to load a page for me to fix a plugin
23:52  hobs: so I just gave up
23:52  dtelepathy: Understood
23:52  dwarder: never give up
23:52  hobs: paul irish knows and sent it on to some guy to fix but still working on it
23:53  coldhead: NEVER LET GO
23:53  hobs: to be honest im still here and I dont know any javascript or jquery
23:53  hobs: I was learning it one day and just offered to clean up some stuff
23:53  hobs: then I never left
23:53  hobs: so id say im doing a pretty good job at not giving up
23:53  dtelepathy: lol
23:53  coldhead: you're a valuable community member, hobs
23:53  coldhead: and a fine writer
23:53  hobs: im never gonna give you up
23:53  dtelepathy: Sorry to beat the dead horse
23:54  dtelepathy: any suggestions for reporting the abuse?
23:54  coldhead: that poor dead horse
23:54  eTiger13: hobs: hmmm can you email me the problem and ill take a look at it at some point soon?
23:54  eTiger13: just gotta figure out which server out of millions of servers that is on
23:54  hobs: sure, let me get some screenshots together
23:55  hobs: what's the email
23:55  coldhead: eTiger13: you got write access to jquery.com?
23:55  eTiger13: maybe. but im not touching the main site
23:57  titusx: does anyone know of a jquery plugin for html validation?
23:57  eTiger13: you mean to validate a page to see if its w3c valid?
23:57  titusx: yes
23:57  hobs: win 11
23:59  eTiger13: titusx: why not just go to the validator page or install the firefox extension?
23:59  dtelepathy: coldhead: case is unfortunately not closed :(
23:59  DAElectric_: is there a way to do a synchronous resize to where one item to where the total width of the 2 items is 100% kinda like a spitter
