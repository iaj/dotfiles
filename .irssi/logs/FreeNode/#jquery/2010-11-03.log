11:08  Znow: hey guys. using the jquery plugin jcarousellite... I got a gridview of 3x3 cases (3 per row(3rows)).. is that possible to make with that plugin? to show the next cases ex: 10-12 and so forth?
11:08  Znow: or is there another plugin that is more flexible in that way
11:08  mekwall: mattems, according to that test... detach is about 15% faster
11:10  mattems: benchmarks and all
11:10  mattems: you guys rock
11:10  mekwall: heh

11:11  nVee: mekwall: The scroller you wrote earlier, how do I set it to only move in a specific area? Currently you set it to top: 50% but I want it to be in my sidebar :) Its currently hovering within my content area :P
11:11  nVee: sorry for all the stupid questions
11:12  nVee: i would do it myself if I knew how to :P
11:12  mekwall: nVee, you want it to have be fixed horizontally?
11:12  mekwall: eh... -have
11:12  Ar-ras: hi, when does the event .load() gets fired?
11:12  nVee: well, it looks like it is situated in the dead center of my page now
11:12  nVee: so I want it to be within my sidebar
11:13  nVee: move up and down as I scroll up and down
11:13  nVee: so it must inherit its "left right" location from where the sidebar is located?
11:13  nVee: if that makes any sense :)
11:13  nVee: ive tried position: inherit
11:13  nVee: but then the image stays just where it is :P

11:14  mekwall: nVee, left: 480px <--- so it will always be 480 px from the left side
11:14  mekwall: change it to whatever fits your situation
11:14  nVee: awesome!
11:14  nVee: 1 question tho
11:14  nVee: will it not change with different resolutions?
11:15  mekwall: nVee, do you have variable width design?
11:17  nVee: mekwall: Sorry, I dont understand?
11:17  nVee: :)
11:18  mekwall: nVee, do your design change in width based on resolution/window size?
11:18  mekwall: fixed or variable :)
11:18  nVee: fixed

11:19  mekwall: it will automatically be placed to the right of the sidebar with 10px left padding
11:19  nVee: haha
11:19  mekwall: nVee, that's what you wanted?
11:19  nVee: shucks I suck at explaining :)
11:20  nVee: nah it must be within the sidebar :P
11:20  nVee: hahaha
11:20  nVee: i see what you did now

11:32  jomofcw: plz

11:33  bot-t: mekwall, jQuery UI - Documentation: UI/Effects/Methods - http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Methods
11:33  jomofcw: " The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called swing, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called linear."
11:33  mekwall: ^--- jomocfw, that perhaps?
11:33  jomofcw: mekwall thanks ^^ and just find this line in doc
11:33  mekwall: jomofcw, yeah... jquery ui have more easings :)

11:37  Ar-ras: but load sucks for finishing loading too
11:37  mekwall: depends on what is loading
11:37  mekwall: m4co, what do you need to check? is it an image?
11:37  Ar-ras: i put load to an img but it doesnt work for me :/
11:38  m4co: mekwall, a <ul> list
11:38  m4co: or it's parent div if you prefer
11:38  mekwall: .load on image will work if it's not cached afaik
11:38  m4co: it's a twitter widget
11:38  mekwall: oh, that's why then :)
11:38  m4co: so it loads separate from the site
11:38  mekwall: then .load is not what you are looking for

13:25  Ely^: Hi, is it possible to merge 2 cells that are next to eachother with as little code possible?
13:26  doonie: sure
13:27  Ely^: well I found some scripts
13:27  Ely^: but they are all very long
13:27  Ely^: I have here my 2 cells http://jsfiddle.net/qndnB/
13:27  doonie: something like ('#td').attr('rowspan', '2').html + " " + ('#td').next().html; ('#td').next().remove; ish
13:27  unfo-: Ely^, var td2html = td2.html(); var td1html = td1.html(); td1.html(td1html + td2.html); td1.attr("colspan", 2) :)
13:28  doonie: colspan ;> my bad heh
13:28  unfo-: similar to what doonie said
13:28  doonie: you forgot to remove td2 ;>
13:28  unfo-: ah right ;)
13:28  doonie: you sire are going on a timeout!
13:28  unfo-: lol ;D
13:29  hekin: running $('.some_checkbox').attr("checked", true) will not trigger the change event, what am i supposed to do to trigger the event?
13:29  unfo-: btw have you guys heard of this: http://reallyslowsite.com/
13:29  unfo-: you can use /5 for 5 sec pause afaik
13:29  unfo-: or maybe it was in millis
13:29  doonie: wow ;p
13:30  doonie: why ;>
13:30  Clorith: Why not
13:30  doonie: whyyyyy
13:30  unfo-: well instad of contriving with setTimeout you have a site that will be slow?

13:55  doonie: i thought we figured this one out
13:55  ohcibi: how to avoid a form beeing submitted by pressing return in one of its inputs?
13:55  Clorith: the nth-child(1) for my checkbox works, the .val() for the textarea works and the .val() o nthe select box works, but everything eles turns up undefined :s
13:56  Clorith: ohcibi: onSubmit and return false?
13:56  ohcibi: Clorith: i dont want to avoid the form beeing submitted, i want to avoid that it gets submitted by pressing enter in _one_ of its inputs
13:56  ohcibi: Clorith: all other inputs + submit button should work as usual
13:57  Clorith: oh...hmm, that's a mighty fine question then
13:57  doonie: Clonix define what you wanted now again
13:57  oodavid: ohcibi: add  keyup to el > check keycode > cancel for enter
13:57  Clorith: doonie: After you've typed 30 characters into the textarea, I want to get the value of the input fields, the checkboxes and the select box, wstored in their own variables
13:58  Clorith: and I'm using the "this" identifier since ther emay be multiple <tr>'s listed downwards(hence the .each() loop)
13:58  doonie: why not juse store the whole form
13:58  Clorith: doonie: What do you mean?
13:59  doonie: ?serialize
13:59  bot-t: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
13:59  doonie: that way you get checkbox: true, fieldx: content
13:59  doonie: etc.. without doing weird stuff :)
14:00  Clorith: hmm, that may work, but could I limit that to just the <tr> I've grabbed with .each() ?
14:00  ohcibi: oodavid: firebug warns me that keycode is useless when using keyup event
14:00  doonie: only if they have a form of their own
14:00  Clorith: Then it won't work, as it's all one massive form
14:01  ohcibi: oodavid: i.e. i found a snippet, which should work, but due to me having another keycode on return, its not working on my pc
14:02  doonie: then i donno, try to simplify your task somehow :) .nth-child should probably be .eq
14:03  ohcibi: oodavid: i mistyped keyup... plus i had to use keydown because the form is submitted on keydown and not up
14:04  Clorith: I could with $(identifier, this).blabla it will always use that <tr>(lots of html etc in here)</tr> as the element it matches inside
14:04  Clorith: so if I do $(".class1", this).val(); and applied class1 to one of my input fields, it'd just trigger for the one in the currently active <tr>, correct?
14:04  oodavid: ohcibi: ahh you got there
14:04  oodavid: just need some sniffing :D
14:06  doonie: Clorith yeah
14:06  Clorith: Awesome, then I think I've found a much simpler workaroudn for this :D
14:06  Clorith: Thank you for your time =) Much appreciated

14:07  martinchristov: HEY :) has anyone had trouble with cufon replacement at an iframe ?

14:10  Hex_101: Wow lol
14:11  Hex_101: well the way cufon works would be that it replaces, so so
14:11  Hex_101: for some reason something is overridng th ehide
14:11  Hex_101: might want to add this to your css, one sec
14:11  Hex_101: .cufon-active cufon-text { display:none; }
14:11  Hex_101: that should work martinchristov, but untested, never had that before
14:12  martinchristov: oh... this looks like a good solution Hex_101
14:12  martinchristov: thanks a lot !
14:13  Hex_101: It's okay.. cufon leaves the old text in, for screen readers
14:13  Hex_101: in the format: <cufontext>oldtexthere</cufontext>
14:13  Hex_101: so if you just hide that element, it should do :)
14:15  martinchristov: cool :) almost did the trick. however I still have some gaps between the words. whatever. .. I'll figure that out in the manner you suggested. thanks again :)

14:21 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:21  quicksilver: hariom: making them hidden in the initial CSS will look better.
14:23  hariom: quicksilver: It means if I make style element display to none it will be much quicker then hiding it using hide(). Right!
14:24  quicksilver: or visibility: hidden
14:24  quicksilver: subtly different effects to display: none
14:24  rmurphey: hariom: or switch a class on it?
14:24  rmurphey: or rather add/remove a class
14:25  rmurphey: and use the class to define whether it is hidden or not
14:25  quicksilver: that's what I meant
14:25  quicksilver: when I said "making them hidden in the initial CSS"
14:25  quicksilver: ;)

14:26  rmurphey: that may be useful to you
14:26  hariom: rmurphey: I want to save as much of network traffic as possible so most of the CSS which I needs immediately after page display, I am adding it with elements itself. Later CSS will be linked to external css.

14:35  rmurphey: oh, and you have
14:35  rmurphey: sorry, i didn't realize the old link was still the one to look at
14:36  dbugger: No problem
14:36  dbugger: But i still don't get the expected behavior :(

14:37  rmurphey: something's wonky therhe
14:37  quicksilver: Ely^: becuase you always prepend it to the first.
14:37  dbugger: I do see some changes as time goes by in the "style" attributes the document, so Im guessing the autoloop is really doing something

14:38  rmurphey: dbugger: are you using firebug or similar?
14:38  dbugger: yes
14:38  rmurphey: ok, so throw a console.log in your document ready and make sure it's running
14:38  Ely^: teh first inside each TD yes ... but it's only in the first td
14:38  quicksilver: Ely^: no.
14:38  quicksilver: Ely^: you are always selecting the first in the page
14:39  Ely^: ah ok
14:39  quicksilver: Ely^: you make no attempt to find the first in the current td.

14:39  dbugger: is this a function? console.log() =
14:39  dbugger: ?
14:39  rmurphey: also dbugger is there any chance there's a css file you're supposed to include?
14:39  rmurphey: dbugger: console.log('it works!')
14:39  Ely^: quicksilver how can I make that attempt

14:40  Ely^: works like a charm
14:40  Ely^: ty
14:40  rmurphey: dbugger: it seems like it's "working" except maybe some css is missing .. but i'm not familiar with slideView
14:40  rmurphey: hovering over the images changes the descriptive text
14:40  rmurphey: clicking on an image takes you to it
14:40  rmurphey: or, not ..
14:41  Ely^: strange that it becomes a part of the link quicksilver
14:41  rmurphey: but, yeah, i'd verify you're not missing some css
14:41  quicksilver: well that's what 'prepend' means
14:41  quicksilver: Ely^: .prepend() adds it to the beginning of the matched element.
14:41  dbugger: oh you were right
14:41  Ely^: ow ok I thought put if before
14:41  quicksilver: Ely^: that would be .before()
14:41  dbugger: if I had the css page of the demo page it works... but it should say so in the documentation page :S
14:42  Ely^: serious ? :p
14:42  rmurphey: welcome to the world of plugins, dbugger
14:42  quicksilver: Ely^: Yes, serious. Read the documentation.
14:42  Ely^: ah ok
14:42  Ely^: ok thx
14:42  Ely^: was always looking at the appending stuff
14:42  dbugger: rmurphey, what does that mean?

15:17  NET||abuse: if you're doing something so light like this, say somekind of redirect logic or something, what approach would you take if not using jquery?

15:22  mark-: Hi all. So I'm writing a Wordpress plugin that uses a jQuery plugin. Is it possible the jQuery plugin requires the noConflict() setting be OFF? How do I check? The plugin is mini'ed
15:22  NET||abuse: Next post, I kick raghav's ass with that shoe!!
15:23  Ar-ras: var $ = jQuery;
15:23  mark-: Ar-ras - is that to me?
15:24  Ar-ras: yes bro
15:24  mark-: but I dont want to have to do that
15:24  mark-: You mean I should search for that in the plugin?
15:24  Ar-ras: then download minified js and replace it
15:24  Ar-ras: no at beginning of your js file
15:24  mark-: wordpress wants me to use noConflict()
15:24  Ar-ras: var $ = jQuery.noConflict();
15:25  NET||abuse: mark-, use an anon function with the jquery reference being only internal
15:25  mark-: I dont know what that means
15:25  mark-: you mean wrap the code in a function that allows $()
15:26  Ar-ras: dude write at the beginning of your var $ = jQuery.noConflict(); and everything is bueno
15:26  Ar-ras: dont waste time
15:26  mark-: alright
15:26  mark-: but doesnt that defeat the purpose of <script type='text/javascript'>try{jQuery.noConflict();}catch(e){};</script>
15:27  Ar-ras: if you code your functions.php correctly, then jquery will be loaded so why do try etc.

15:34  NET||abuse: Aristata, but not he div itself?
15:34  Aristata: I just want the background image to go away, fade out
15:34  Aristata: If I can do that with some alpha setting than so be it
15:34  Brodingo: sounds tricky
15:34  NET||abuse: i don't think you can fade a background-image
15:34  Ar-ras: if you want to do something like this then you break the separation between design and content
15:34  Brodingo: might be easier to animate an absolutely positioned div with an img
15:34  mark-: Ar-ras - thank you.
15:34  Aristata: I hate absolute positioning
15:34  NET||abuse: i think you'd have to have 2 divs, one iwth content and one with just background absolutely placed on the same location
15:34  Aristata: hrm
15:34 * NET||abuse belched
15:34 * NET||abuse is sorry for NET||split
15:34  Aristata: Is there anyway around this without another div?
15:35  NET||abuse: ... not really. in js create a new div in the dom iwth js code
15:35  Ar-ras: yes, prepend div to parent() per jquery

15:41  Ar-ras: wut?
15:41  Ar-ras: why
15:41  timing: wut tuh fuk!
15:41  Yoric: Essentially, I have an extract <foo id="bar"/><script>$("#bar").doSomething()</script>, which I'm inserting with .html() .
15:41  Brodingo: no
15:42  Ar-ras: and whats the point of this?
15:42  timing: haha
15:42  Yoric: The script is triggered immediately -- and this seems to be before my <foo> is actually inserted.
15:42  Yoric: So $("#bar") is an empty jQuery.
15:42  timing: why do you trigger your script this way?
15:42  Ar-ras: an empty jQuery?
15:42  timing: why not just run the code based on a certain value
15:42  Yoric: A tad complicated. Let's just say that it's sent dynamically from the server.
15:43  Ar-ras: like ajax code?
15:43  Yoric: Well, yes.
15:43  timing: then just run it through evil()
15:43  Brodingo: cant you use load() with a callback?
15:43  Ar-ras: where you can separately execude jquery after the jquery object is loaded?
15:44  Ar-ras: execute javascript
15:44  Ar-ras: ajax object loaded
15:44  Yoric: This whole code is generated on the server. I'd rather avoid having to parse it on the client, just for the sake of separating <foo> from <script>.
15:44  Ar-ras: damn, kind of weird when you think jquery = javascript
15:44  Yoric: How comes the script is executed before the DOM node is created?
15:45  Yoric: How comes the script is executed before the DOM node for <foo> is created?
15:45  gkatsev: the problems arise when people start using jquery as a language and not as helpers to js.
15:45  Yoric: gkatsev: well, that's the problem with all frameworks, I guess.
15:45  Yoric: (on whichever side of the HTTP connexion)
15:46  Yoric: Can anyone confirm my diagnosis, though?
15:46 --- deadocelot is now known as not_deadocelot
15:46  Yoric: i.e. that the script is executed before the DOM tree is changed?

15:47  bertrand_: I'm building a plugin and across 3 methods they each share some code... to my mind this needs to be reusable, would you add it to another method of the plugin or make a function to handle it it and place it at the end of the plugin file, but within the Jquery block?
15:47  Ar-ras: well yes,
15:47  gkatsev: Yoric: yes, but javascript and jQuery is especially susceptible to it because a lot of js newbies get directed to jQuery when they try to do something that is a lot easier with jquery and thus they forgo learning js and end up messing up the whole web.
15:47  Ar-ras: your javascript is maybe faster then your dom
15:48  frio80: gkatsev: +1
15:48  Yoric: Ar-ras: that sounds unlikely.
15:48  gkatsev: bertrand_: yes, you want to refactor that code out to another function.
15:48  Ar-ras: gkatsev has said it
15:48  Ar-ras: you misusing jquery
15:48  bertrand_: me misusuing?
15:49  gkatsev: bertrand_: first class objects make this a lot easier and fun.
15:49  Ar-ras: @Yoric
15:49  bertrand_: phew   =@==>
15:50  Yoric: gkatsev: granted.
15:51  Ar-ras: yoric, why not using $.ajax
15:51  Yoric: I tend to avoid frameworks, but jQuery is quite convenient as a compatibility-layer for browser quirks.
15:51  Yoric: And, again, in this case, I have the same issue with jQuery or without.
15:52  Yoric: I was just hoping that I had met a somewhat-well-known issue with a well-known workaround.
15:53  Yoric: I guess I'll have to change the server->client protocol.
15:53  Yoric: Thanks.

16:08  Shwaiil: wib, I see. I'm woste to mootools, this is the first time i'll stick with jquery, the syntax looks similar.

16:17  diamonds: but I can't seem to find a listing of what all's on there
16:18  MrJones: now I want to insert it into a container element into the site graph, so I used .html() for it
16:18  MrJones: the bad thing is, <script> blocks in there don't get executed then, but that's what I'd like to do
16:18  MrJones: so what do I need to do to get the script blocks executed when it's inserted into the site? (since .html() doesn't do this)
16:18  Ar-ras: separate code from content?
16:18  MrJones: ok and then?
16:18  MrJones: eval() on the requested code?
16:19  MrJones: it would be actually a bit challenging to separate them
16:19  MrJones: so if there's an easier solution...
16:20  openstandards: sorted out my problem applying a .hide to the dialog sorted the problem
16:21  MrJones: Ar-ras: since it is autogenerated I can only get it in one request from the server
16:21  MrJones: (fetching it separately would give sync problems when the server state changed between the two fetches)
16:22  MrJones: hm ok I might use a json object maybe...
16:22  MrJones: noone having an idea how to do this? I'm quite new to javascript and jquery
16:22  Ar-ras: yes json could help, and then with $.ajax you put html execute javascript
16:22  MrJones: I tried putting html there
16:23  MrJones: sadly that doesn't seem to execute the javascript at all :/
16:23  MrJones: also since the script wants to access the html elements in the fetched html itself it wouldn't make sense to run it before the insertion into the site graph is done

16:29  alexcabrera: Brodingo: It's handling error-free responses fine, but my API throws a 404 when an item isn't found, and I'd like to gracefully handle that in my method
16:29  oDesk: danheberden: actually i don't know how to extract the index from inside the name of the input element which is inside the TR that i'm cloning

16:34  danheberden: oDesk - replace the occurance of "id" with "name" in the code i gave ya
16:35  danheberden: the principle is, using a function for the setting of attr
16:35 --- boaz_ is now known as boaz
16:35  danheberden: and inside that function, you alter the existing name
16:37  dilvie: Does IE 6 support Array.push()?
16:37  danheberden: sure
16:38  oDesk: danheberden: it's  TR block that being copied not only the input element, so the TR doesn't have name i should loop into the TR input elements and change the names
16:39  danheberden: so after the clone, find('input.doYOuHaveAClassNameOnThem')
16:40  dilvie: Hi Paul - h5Validate is going into production at Zumba.com soon - millions of users using HTML5 forms in current generation browsers. =)  We're also using html5 boilerplate.
16:41  Brodingo: if zumba.com is anything like zombo.com then IM THERE
16:43  danheberden: if it's anything like zoomba the cardio workout
16:43  dilvie: danheberden: Zumba Fitness is a cardio workout. Is there a copy-cat called zoomba? =)
16:43  danheberden: ah - mis spelled
16:44  dilvie: ten million people per week attend zumba classes.
16:44  Brodingo: all i know is that the infinite is unknown at zombo.com
16:44  dilvie: Brodingo: the possibilities are endless at Zombo.com
16:45  paul_irish: dilvie: huge!
16:45  paul_irish: omg my mom does zumba
16:45  dilvie: LOL
16:45  paul_irish: <3
16:45  paul_irish: dilvie: did you keep the pink text highlight?
16:45  Brodingo: yeah where the hot pink
16:45  Brodingo: at
16:46  dilvie: paul: we probably will, because it blends with our branding.
16:46  paul_irish: HOT
16:46  paul_irish: do it
16:46  dilvie: paul: we're using magenta links. =)
16:46  Brodingo: lollll
16:46  dilvie: paul: I'm thinking we should have unicorns, too.
16:46  Brodingo: its a revolution
16:46  dilvie: cornify here we come!
16:47  paul_irish: WOOT DO IT
16:47  alexcabrera: does the error callback in $.ajax catch things like 404s from an API?
16:47  guredrose: Rainy Season in Koh Samui now
16:47  paul_irish: alexcabrera: yes
16:47  guredrose: I'm sick
16:48  alexcabrera: paul_irish: So I'm likely just an idiot?
16:48  paul_irish: perhaps! pastie your code in shit
16:48  paul_irish: i gotta roll. someone will look at it
16:48  paul_irish: dilvie: keep me posted.
16:48  alexcabrera: paul_irish: http://dpaste.org/SkI9/
16:48  alexcabrera: am I doing something just completely wrong?
16:49  dilvie: paul: cool. Will do. =)
16:50  danheberden: alexcabrera: put a console.log('errored') in the error handler - make sure it's getting fired
16:50  danheberden: second, returning false tehre won't return false for your get function
16:51  danheberden: but, rather, the closure
16:51  alexcabrera: danheberden: yes, it's getting fired
16:51  danheberden: plus, is there a reason you're using async: false? it locks up the browser - why not just use tthe callbacks to their full potential?
16:52  alexcabrera: danheberden: I figured I was using async wrong
16:52 --- sab_ is now known as sab
16:52  danheberden: i would strive to take advantage of the event based style of it instead of so linearly
16:53  alexcabrera: danheberden: Is what I'm trying to do making any sense though? I'm trying to build REST resource objects that are all fed off an API
16:53  alexcabrera: is there something inherently wrong with that idea?
16:54  danheberden: and one option is to supply your get function with a handler - so  var functiontoRunIfSuccessful = function(data) { /* do shit */ };  CartResource.get( parameter, functionToRunIfSucessful );
16:54  danheberden: alexcabrera: no, i just htink you need to rethink the architecture a tad
16:54  danheberden: because there is a delay
16:55  alexcabrera: danheberden: what's the best way to minimize that delay?
16:55  v-dogg: regarding my earliers question about supported HTTP methods w/ ajax requests: it seems at least Firefox supports "anything". $.ajax({type: 'TEE-POT', url: '/test.php'}); works and Apache+PHP shows "TEE-POT" as the request method
16:55  danheberden: it's not "go get pk:4" it's "ask for pk:4 and hopefully it answers"
16:55  danheberden: alexcabrera: well that's just internet traffic - so send only the data you need
16:55  alexcabrera: danheberden: so how can I best handle the lag?
16:55  alex__c2022: So when an ajax request is sent and returns back some HTML that is appended to document. The styling is applied to that HTML, however, event handlers are not. Is there a workaround/solution for this? Do I have to add all event handlers again to elements within that HTML?
16:55  danheberden: alexcabrera: the best thing is to not lock the user - use the time for helpful feedback
16:56  danheberden: by the time a thing that says 'working' or 'loading' or 'hold your horses i'm busy' fades in, you probably have your data
16:56  alexcabrera: I was hoping that handling the feedback would be the job of the code that was using these objects
16:56  danheberden: and if not, then the userknows what's going on
16:56  Pilate: alex: use .live
16:56  danheberden: alexcabrera: and it can be
16:56  danheberden: you can pass functions
16:56  alexcabrera: which is the handlers your were talking about
16:57  danheberden: ya
16:57  danheberden: "go get pk:4 - oh, and when you're done, fire off this bad boy with the data"
16:57  danheberden: instead of a linear process like php
16:57  alex__c2022: Pilate: was that for me?
16:57  Pilate: yep
16:57  alex__c2022: Pilate: thanks
16:58  alexcabrera: danheberden: that makes a lot more sense
16:58  alexcabrera: so then I'd just drop the function they called into the error or success
16:58  alexcabrera: can I have some sort of basic function that would do something like log to the console if nothing has been passed?
16:58  oDesk: danheberden: i did this after cloning    $('#currency_form tr:last').prev()[0].childNodes[1].childNodes[0].name = "currency_id["+ number +"]";
16:58  alexcabrera: because ideally you'd just override stuff, right?
16:58  danheberden: oDesk - can you paste your code?
16:59  danheberden: ?p @ oDesk
16:59  bot-t: oDesk, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
16:59  danheberden: alexcabrera: depends if you need the error response or not
16:59  oDesk: danheberden: ok let me send you simple scrano
17:00  danheberden: it might be success: function(data) { yourCallback( true, data); }, error: function() {{ yourCallback( false) }
17:00  Prometheus: might make sense to pass the error objects on to the function in case of error
17:00  Prometheus: so that the client can figure out what went wrong
17:01  danheberden: yes definitely
17:04  b52: a good jquery plugin to overlay the page by something i retrieve using an ajax call ?
17:05  Prometheus: where to begin =)
17:05  Prometheus: pretty much any of the modal plugins
17:06  Prometheus: b52: blockUI might work for you
17:06  b52: i just wanna show a lil bit of html in simple overlay window fashion
17:07  Brodingo: fancybox or colorbox?

17:20  explodes: How do I disable an input? $('input#myId').disabled(true); ?
17:21  explodes: ?? disable
17:21  explodes: ?disable

17:36  badtwin: noone has an answer about my question? :(

17:38 --- ezra-g is now known as ezra-gphthegeek
17:38  explodes: dunno badtwin
17:39  Cork[home]: hmm, it should work...
17:39  badtwin: it only works, when it's in the first tab
17:40  ChrisPitzer: I'm having a really odd bug.  I'm using requirejs (i'm using the jquery bundle).  I've got some text!/foo/bar.tmpl files I'm loading, and I'm running google maps.  On one particular page, if I load text files that have not been loaded by other pages, the google map stalls on some authentication request.
17:40  ChrisPitzer: they are seemingly unrelated issues...
17:41  ChrisPitzer: but i can trigger the bug easily by loading or not loading a dummy .tmpl file
17:41  Cork[home]: badtwin: its farly the same as whats in here http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
17:41  ChrisPitzer: load the file - no map, and vice versa.
17:42  alecs: badtwin: i think it is working ...
17:42  badtwin: what exactly do you mean, Cork[home]? the stuff with 'connect lists thorugh tabs'?
17:42  Cork[home]: ya
17:42  Cork[home]: i know i've seen an example about is somewhere
17:43  Miff: can anyone confirm that the example on this page works? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#xml
17:43  Miff: i've tried other examples, datepicker() for instance, and it works fine
17:43  badtwin: ok. then i'll try that. thank you
17:43  Miff: but .autocmplete in that form just wont do anything
17:43  Cork[home]: badtwin: and connected sortables in a second tab is what you have on the right of the page i linked to
17:44  badtwin: i'm already reading ;)

17:47  SingAlong: hi all
17:47  SingAlong: any jquery gallery plugin that's mobile compatible? (android especially)
17:48  JoeEllis: I'm trying to bind a load event to a select box like so: $('select.course').bind("load change", function () {..}), but it doesn't fire on load like I'd expect.  Can anyone explain to me why exactly?
17:49  jomofcw: SingAlong not sure but if it's make with jQuery it's kinda compatible with Android Browser
17:49  jomofcw: nop ?
17:49  jomofcw: The one you need now is to "design it" for Mobile
17:49  jomofcw: The script still be the same
17:49  SingAlong: jomofcw: ya. but the screensize etc does matter :) oz most galleries I tested are broken
17:50  dinosaadeh: guys, anyone know of a slider/scroller.. no scrollbar, i just place arrows to right and left of divs and i scroll.. i dont want those that scroll every three together
17:51  jomofcw: SingAlong what did you mean by "screensize" ? Navigate on my Android browser, the "screensize" is "emulated" like a large screen, except for explicit mobile website.
17:51  jomofcw: and so, if the "size" matter, just rewrite the css, nop ?
17:51  SingAlong: jomofcw: any gallery plugin you know that works fine on your phone?
17:51  docgnome: Is there a function to see if an element only has a given class?
17:52  JoeEllis: hasClass()
17:52  docgnome: right that will say if it has a class, but not if that is the only class
17:52  jomofcw: I just load a Colorbox
17:52  jomofcw: And it works
17:52  jomofcw: SingAlong ^
17:53  SingAlong: jomofcw: you mean a color picker?
17:53  jomofcw: Nop
17:53  jomofcw: http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/core/example1/index.html
17:53  docgnome: or maybe is there a way to get every class of an element back?
17:53  jomofcw: SingAlong ^ click :)
17:53  jomofcw: docgnome .attr('class')
17:53  docgnome: jomofcw: ah. thanks
17:53  jomofcw: it gives you each class in one string
17:54  jomofcw: class still be an attribute ;)
17:54  docgnome: hehe yeah. brain-o
17:54  jomofcw: lol docgnome :p
17:54  OhaiBBQ: .attr('class').toString().split(' ') for an object with all the classes
17:54  jomofcw: Yep good solution OhaiBBQ ^^.
17:56  docgnome: ah. perfect! :-)
17:59  Shaylor: Anyone using Superbox?
18:03 --- mfer is now known as mfer-lunch
18:03  jomofcw: nop Shaylor, I usually go with colorBox [but dunno superbox]
18:04  Shaylor: Ah well. Thanks anyway.
18:04  jomofcw: What's the prob with superbox ?
18:05  jomofcw: It's usually an easiest way to ask for the real problem, than to ask for anyone who could know something about the prob ^^
18:05  Shaylor: Our mock-ups use multiple modal dialogs, which SuperBox doesn't support.
18:06  Shaylor: Or doesn't appear to, anyway.
18:06  jomofcw: hm OK... have you tried to get it with jQuery UI ?
18:06  jomofcw: And what's happen so ? "doesn't support" ?
18:07  Shaylor: It uses a single div for all its contents.
18:07  Shaylor: And the event handlers appear to be unbound when it's open.
18:07  jomofcw: Shaylor, yea it create a single element that will be the superbox, that's ?
18:08  Shaylor: I'm looking for a way to display a modal box on top of a modal box.
18:08  jomofcw: Shaylor not sure but the jQuery UI Dialog should be the job
18:08  Shaylor: I checked the demos on the jQuery UI, it replaces the old box with the new one instead of displaying one on top of the other.
18:09  jomofcw: Shaylor I'm sure I do a multi modal with it :s
18:10  jomofcw: are you sure you create dialog from different element ?
18:10  jomofcw: "from" = "based on"
18:10  Shaylor: I just went to the demo page and used Firebug to "click" multiple links...
18:11  docgnome: hrm... Having a bit of trouble. Any easy way to select all the visible tr's of a table that only have one class?
18:11  Shaylor: jomo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
18:11  jomofcw: yea ^^ try it, I'm sure it does the job
18:11  JohnTheBuffer: Guys, what is wrong with this code? It doesn't do a thing: $.getJSON("/Php/dirs.php", {},  function(data){ $.each(data.items,function(i,item){ $("<li>foo</li>").appendTo("#orgs"); }); });
18:11  jomofcw: docgnome what do you mean with "visible" ? visibility or display ?
18:11  jomofcw: And is it always the same class ?
18:12  docgnome: jomofcw: well the current code is... $("tr:visible",table.tBodies[0])
18:12  docgnome: jomofcw: what i'm trying to do is modify a table sorter that does zebra striping on the table to make it not stripe if the row already has a class
18:12  jomofcw: $("tr[class=myClass]:visible",table.tBodies[0])
18:12  jomofcw: docgnome ^
18:13  jomofcw: docgnome I think you've better to do it with CSS nop ?
18:13  docgnome: i don't follow
18:13  jomofcw: And using !important or order declaration to override the stripe.
18:14  jomofcw: Have you got any online HTML docgnome ?
18:14  docgnome: ... oh duh.
18:14  docgnome: i always forget about !important
18:14  jomofcw: Yea, very usefull, but use it with care
18:14  docgnome: i should just use that and then i don't have to change the table sorter
18:14  docgnome: thanks ;-p
18:14  jomofcw: You could easily override it with declaration priority
18:14  docgnome: eh?
18:14  jomofcw: np docgnome :)
