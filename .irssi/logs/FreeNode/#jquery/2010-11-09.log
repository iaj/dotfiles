09:11  mekwall: there we go
09:16  mekwall: harovali1, you there?
09:16  harovali1: mekwall: thanks, fiddling with what you posted, I got pretty much what I wanted. I think the problem has to do with some box model problem.
09:16  mekwall: harovali1, but does my plugin work better?
09:16  mekwall: and do you need any other options?
09:17  harovali1: mekwall: yes it does
09:17  harovali1: mekwall: I added the keyup: expand item to the dict , and it works even better
09:17  mekwall: harovali1, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/WDt44/
09:17  mekwall: check latest update :P
09:18  Superman_: any fiddle or jsbin working example of scrolling thumbnails...?
09:18  mekwall: did some optimizations
09:18  harovali1: mekwall: I also did this change : $this.height(this.scrollHeight+4);
09:18  mekwall: harovali1, well... that latest update should solve any problems afaik
09:18  harovali1: mekwall: thanks, I'll check them up
09:18  mekwall: you shouldn't need to edit anything hehe
09:18  harovali1: mekwall: :-) thanks a lot
09:18  mekwall: harovali1, also with animation support hehe
09:19  harovali1: mekwall: may I ask  newbe thing ?   how do I tell the initial rendering to 'expand' every textarea element ?
09:20  Superman_: http://jsfiddle.net/SuWft/
09:20  mekwall: harovali1, just like in the fiddle... $(function() { $('textarea').textareaExpander(); });
09:20  Superman_: I need help with  thumb scroller
09:21  mekwall: Superman_, what's the problem?
09:21  harovali1: but I just get the areas expanded when I put something there, I'd like them to show the whoel lines ASAP
09:21  harovali1: mekwall: the animation ROCKS
09:21  Superman_: you can see that I'm scrolling thumbs
09:21  mekwall: harovali1, sure... can solve that :)
09:21  Superman_: by a hard coded value
09:21  Superman_: i need to count the images at runtime and then allow to scroll
09:22  Superman_: by hovering over scroll up and scroll down
09:22  harovali1: mekwall: me or kind you ?

09:24  dsdeiz: Superman_: u sir are super
09:24  Superman_: thanks
09:24  Superman_: but I'm here to fix it up its not dynamic
09:25  Superman_: :)
09:25  Superman_: mekwall does i make sense to you??
09:26  harovali1: mekwall: it's pretty awsome. Just a 'bug' , it 'animates' on every keystroke, up and down.
09:30  Superman_: :)
09:30  Superman_: mekwall mekwall
09:30  mekwall: Superman_, hold on... working on another thing :P
09:31  Superman_: ok :)
09:32  mekwall: harovali1, I cannot replicate that?
09:32  mekwall: harovali1, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/WDt44/
09:32  mekwall: updated...
09:32  mekwall: now default value of minHeight is 'inherit'
09:33  harovali1: mekwall: let's see
09:33  mekwall: so whatever you set it to with css or in style, that will be it's minHeight
09:33  ningia: hi all
09:33  mekwall: which works better when you want to apply it to multiple textareas
09:38  hExDj: I am using jquery mobile, when I use data-role="page" all images show a question mark placeholder on my test site,  any ideas?
09:40  Superman_: they dont find image path
09:40  Superman_: check ur images path first
09:40  Superman_: mekwall mekwall :)
09:41  mekwall: harovali1, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/WDt44/ <-- fix for padding

09:43  mekwall: Superman_, textarea expand? :)
09:43  Superman_: yes
09:43  mekwall: hehe cool
09:44  timing: joshsmith: I always log the keycode object, press e e e e e e and see what keycode it is
09:44  Superman_: mekwall can u looked at my fiddle
09:44  mekwall: sure
09:44  Superman_: http://jsfiddle.net/SuWft/
09:45  joshsmith: timing: yeah I'm gonna have to; just hoping someone might know it off the top of their head for some oddball reason
09:45  Superman_: I want to know the height of each image and then according to that scroll the whole thing
09:45  mekwall: Superman_, ok :)
09:45  Superman_: right now its fixed and hard coded
09:45  harovali1: mekwall: thanks a big lot , you kind man , you've been very helpful
09:45  joshsmith: 69, if anyone's curious
09:45  Superman_: 96 if anyone's curious
09:46  mekwall: harovali1, np :) but is it still buggy?
09:46  Superman_: I think no, :) mekwall
09:46  harovali1: mekwall: I think the setup needs some work still , though. I'll stick to some of the versions , with minor adjustments that 'just work for my case' , if you don't mind
09:46  harovali1: mekwall: f.i., I can see some flickering when adding text
09:47  harovali1: mekwall: and there is some issue with the size of the font (more precisely the part of the line shown) in the last line
09:47 @coldhead: i love you Superman_!
09:48  harovali1: mekwall: and I'm tired indeed to report apropriately
09:48  Superman_: thanks :)
09:48  harovali1: mekwall: I'll be bak tomorrow , and report back , should you don't mind ?
09:49  mekwall: Superman_, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/SuWft/1/
09:49  Superman_: its looking gorgeous mekwall
09:49  mekwall: Superman_, seems to be scrolling too far though
09:49  Superman_: but one thing i want to ask if i have less than 4 images in thumnbs
09:49  Superman_: then it will scroll??
09:50  Superman_: i think not. right?
09:50  hExDj: Superman_: images load fine when I don't put data-role="page"
09:51  hExDj: so paths are not the problem
09:51  Superman_: hexDj any fiddle so we can take a look
09:51  Superman_: mekwall one more request
09:51  mekwall: Superman_, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/SuWft/2/

09:51  Superman_: nops hexDj sorry
09:52  Superman_: mekwall the second fiddle isnt scrolling them all
09:53  Superman_: there are more thumbs in the markup but its only scrolling 8
09:53  mekwall: Superman_, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/SuWft/3/
09:53  mekwall: there
09:53  Superman_: mekwall thanks just for a concept
09:54  Superman_: plz tell me that what's the logic
09:54  Superman_: we get height of each img
09:55  Superman_: and also what the asterisk is doing in totalThumbHeight*-1
09:58  mekwall: Superman_, the asterisk is multiplication minus 1 :)
09:58  mekwall: which gives the same amount but negative
09:58  joshsmith: how do I prevent bubbling of events when clicking on a checkbox that itself is within a div (and clicks are bound to both)
09:58  Superman_: a+=1;
09:58  Superman_: like a*=2; right?
09:59  mekwall: Superman_, and I'm only getting the height of the thumb container... waste mapping a function to each image
09:59  jomn: anyone know of a good maps tutorial?
09:59  mekwall: Superman_, no :) a*-1 :)

10:14  mekwall: indeed
10:14  mekwall: coldhead, even harder with night vision scope on 100x zoom

12:56  monkeynut: @bot-t
12:57  monkeynut: !bot-t
12:57  monkeynut: can anyone see what i'm typing?
12:57  juha_: no
12:58  monkeynut: he he, cheers juha :)
12:58  danslo: monkeynut: I think you're best off just asking your question. If someone knows he'll answer :)
12:59  monkeynut: okey dokey ...
13:00  monkeynut: I want to know if the .ajaxStop event will be fired when the ajax requests all return or when the callbacks from all the xhr objects have completed ...
13:00  monkeynut: basically I wanted to use ajaxStop but I have to guarantee that not only have the requests completed but the callbacks have also finished running
13:01  monkeynut: thanks in advance for any help :)
13:01  nils_r: Is there a way to create animations based on css? eg I add an class that changes the positionof an element and jQuery creates the animation?

13:02  revolveweb:  e.preventDefault(); });  then why would the hyperlink still work?
13:03  monkeynut: @revolveweb, I think for live events you need to finish with return false to prevent the hyperlink being followed.
13:04  revolveweb: i tried tha ttoo
13:04  monkeynut: is there any reason not to just remove the href property?
13:04  monkeynut: why does it need to by a hyperlink at all?
13:05  revolveweb: because sometimes the hyperlink may want to link depending on the page
13:06  monkeynut: so you want two classes, one when the hyperlink is working normally and one where it fires your live event?

13:07  revolveweb:  kind of yes monkeynut
13:07  mekwall: nils_r, http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggleClass/
13:08  revolveweb: thing is I don't get why it isnt preventing the default
13:10  monkeynut: @revolveweb, I think this is something to do with bubbling not working in the same way for live querie3s
13:10  monkeynut: sorry, live events
13:10  monkeynut: I think you will have to modify the link *when* you change the class
13:11  revolveweb: i changed it to a click and not using live and same thing
13:11  monkeynut: if you want your <a> to be restored at some point, store the href in oldhref or something
13:12  revolveweb: is oldhref valid tag?
13:13  monkeynut: you can create any other tags you like (tested firefox/chrome/opera)
13:13  monkeynut: they just won't be interpreted
13:13  monkeynut: I use this all the time to store old values or bits of meta-data
13:13  monkeynut: very useful
13:13  monkeynut: oh sorry, clean up confusion .... not a tag, a property of a tag
13:14  monkeynut: so for example  $('#mylink').attr('oldref', $('#mylink').attr('href') );
13:15  monkeynut: will create an attribute called oldref equal to what href is, then you can remove href but still restore it later by doing the opposite
13:15  monkeynut: it would be nice if the preventDefault just works but i've seen a number of situations where it inexplicably doesn't and I've had to work around it instead ..
13:16  monkeynut: e.g. according to this:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265478/preventdefault-on-an-a-tag     what you used has worked for the same thing for other people ...
13:17  JKarsrud_: monkeynut: what do you mean preventDefault() doesn't work?
13:17  revolveweb: monkeynut, if you are "creating" new tags then you should use data-
13:18  monkeynut: not tags, attributes
13:18  monkeynut: can use data, but I use the way I said ...
13:18  monkeynut: @JKarsrud_  well, for example it's not working for revolveweb
13:19  monkeynut: look at his code sample, it should work if preventDefault is working.
13:19  JKarsrud_: okay, I just joined, so haven't seen anything :)
13:21  revolveweb: very odd, it works in firefox not chrome >.<
13:21  JKarsrud_: revolveweb: Do you have a paste? This seems odd
13:23  monkeynut: if I add a class of reload_data on a hyperlink then have:
13:23  monkeynut: $('.reload_data').live('click', function(e) {
13:23  monkeynut:  e.preventDefault(); });
13:23  monkeynut: (quoting revolveweb earlier)
13:23  JKarsrud_: And that doesn't work?
13:23  revolveweb: http://pastebin.com/3TbaENhh
13:24  revolveweb: it alerts in firefox fine, in chrome it will activate the href
13:24  monkeynut: I think it's a chrome bug to be filed .... in the meantime, you should think of a workaround.
13:25  monkeynut: luckily my professional development is for internal stuff ... I get to demand everyone uses firefox or doesn't use my app! :P
13:25  JKarsrud_: Alerts in Chrome here
13:25  revolveweb: grrr, must be caching :|:|
13:25  JKarsrud_: http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/6Ykva/
13:25  JKarsrud_: That works
13:26  JKarsrud_: Even without return false
13:26  monkeynut: @revolveweb, you mean it works now and it didn't seem to work because it was using an old cached version of your code?
13:26  revolveweb: monkeynut, it would seem so
13:26 * revolveweb loves wasting time
13:26  monkeynut: he he, I've been got by that one before!
13:27  monkeynut: I now use the web-developer tools and disable cache completely while i'm developing
13:27  monkeynut: I only turn it on for my production tests before push to stable
13:27  monkeynut: could save you time in the future ;)

13:35  finfin82: hello everyone
13:35  mekwall: ?.ajaxStop @ monkeynut
13:35 @bot-t: monkeynut, .ajaxStop(handler):  http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/
13:35  mekwall: monkeynut, "Whenever an Ajax request completes, jQuery checks whether there are any other outstanding Ajax requests. If none remain, jQuery triggers the ajaxStop event. Any and all handlers that have been registered with the .ajaxStop() method are executed at this time."
13:36  monkeynut: cheers mekwall, i've scoured the api doc, it's not clear what the behavior is
13:36  mekwall: I think it's pretty obvious it triggers after xhr is fully completed (all data recieved)
13:36  monkeynut: specifically, there's no clarification of what it means when it says  'request completes'
13:36  finfin82: i have a short understanding question to this code: http://jsfiddle.net/G5vHs/ <--- how do i get a return value  no matter if there is a ajax-call or the data is allready available
13:36  mekwall: it only triggers when there are no more outstanding Ajax requests
13:37  monkeynut: well, i'm not sure if the xhr is registered as fully completed when the data is recieved or it's callbacks have completed
13:37  mekwall: monkeynut, when it's recieved
13:37  mekwall: monkeynut, how else could you manipulate the data in the callback? :)
13:37  mekwall: if all of it wasn't recieved?
13:37  imme-emosol: hey, i'm working with a site that uses jquery already, now i want to create a draggable, is there a place where i can download it vor jquery version 1.2.6 ?
13:38  monkeynut: I know e.g success callback is fired when data is successfully recieved
13:38  finfin82: i know that i can use $.ajax instead of .get with option async:false; and set a var inside the success function and return it finaly.... but its not the way i want to do
13:38  monkeynut: that's how you manipulate that data in the callback
13:39  mekwall: imme-emosol, legacy jquery ui is for 1.3.x so I guess you're out of luck :/
13:39  deploy: With UI autocomplete, when I specify 'http://localhost:3000/data.json'  as the source, its requesting 'http://localhost/data.json?term=whatever' from the server, i.e. it ignores the PORT. Whats that about??
13:39  mekwall: monkeynut, error, complete and success all fire at the same place
13:40  imme-emosol: mekwall: buggers, any change the 1.3.x version might work ?
13:40  imme-emosol: chance that is :s
13:40  monkeynut: so .ajaxStop will also fire at that same place so long as there are no other requests with data in transit
13:40  imme-emosol: grmbl.
13:40  mekwall: ?tias @ imme-emosol
13:40 @bot-t: imme-emosol, Try It And See

13:41  mekwall: but then again... jquery ui != jquery
13:41  imme-emosol: so i could try to just replace that old jquery-file with a new one and see if everything still works :s ?
13:42  mekwall: monkeynut, based on status it's either error or success... complete will trigger right after

13:42  sean`: monkeynut

13:43  doonie: no u!

13:45  mekwall: monkeynut, why'd you wanna do that?
13:47  mekwall: finfin82, you cannot do it like that... the function will always return before the ajax request have finished
13:48  finfin82: mekwall: i know... any ideas?
13:48  finfin82: ;-)
13:48  monkeynut: @mekwall, because the requests will return data, things will happen.  I want to fire off a sanity check once all the dust has settled
13:48  mekwall: finfin82, ofc... do whatever you need to do in the callback function
13:48  monkeynut: if I use ajaxStop() and it fires as soon as the data has been recieved, the callbacks won't have done what they needed to do and my sanity checks will be performed too early
13:48  mekwall: monkeynut, then do so before "things will happen" in all the callbacks :)
13:49  mekwall: monkeynut, setInterval to see if it's ready to be checked then?
13:49  mekwall: or just delay the check
13:49  monkeynut: @mekwall ... I can't sanity check before things happen in the callback, and all callbacks need to complete for me to sanity check
13:50  mekwall: monkeynut, well... do it in the complete callback then
13:50  mekwall: it should fire after success
13:50  monkeynut: @mekwall, I thought of delay timer ... but some people are on very fast lines with very fast computers and some people are using vpn over 3g with bad signal on old laptops!
13:50  monkeynut: @mekwall ... I can't do it in the complete callback, that doesn't make sense
13:51  monkeynut: unless the complete callback only fires once all other callbacks of the xhr are completed
13:51  monkeynut: but even then, I need something global that checks things after ALL callbacks from xhr have completed
13:51  monkeynut: * ALL xhrs

13:55  sean`: On what do you bind ajaxStop?
13:55  monkeynut: the only solution I can think of is a messy one ...
13:55  monkeynut: .ajaxStop would be bound on a little error indicator div ... but I think that's unimportant?
13:56  monkeynut: since regardless of where it is bound it has the same behavior
13:56  silv3r_m00n: is there a jquery plugin , in which we select a language and a virtual keyboard for the language comes up , something like a character map ?
13:57  monkeynut: the only effect being what $(this) refers to ...
13:57  sean`: $.ajaxSetup ({beforeSend: function () { $elem.data ('calls.ajax', ($elem.data ('calls.ajax') || 0) + 1); });
13:57  mekwall: monkeynut, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/tnwkF/
13:57  sean`: $elem.ajaxStop (function () { $elem.data ('calls.ajax', $elem.data('calls.ajax')--); if (!$elem.data ('calls.ajax')) { they're completed } });
13:59  sean`: -- should go before btw
13:59  monkeynut: cheers mekwall, but that isn't really what I need ... that would fire every time an ajax object receives all its data. Not after all callbacks of that xhr have completed.  Also it would fire for every request but I only want it to fire on teh last request
13:59  Aamir: in JSON is    "clickOnLoad" : false  === "clickOnLoad"	:  "false"  ?
14:00  monkeynut: @sean` ... wouldn't this just emulate the behavior of ajaxStopr ... i.e. can't actually tell you that all the callbacks have finished processing
14:01  finfin82: mekwall: this is an OOP-function i cant do everything in the callback
14:01  mahen23: i want to modify ckeditor
14:01  finfin82: cause there are different things todo ;-)
14:01  monkeynut: I guess i'll just have to go back to something like adding a function call saying " I'm done " to the end of every callback which increases a counter ... but that still leaves me polling a counter instead of having an event :(
14:02  mekwall: finfin82, you'll need to create a callback function that is connected to the object
14:02  finfin82: can you give me a short example?
14:02  mahen23: by default, when you upload an image, ckeditor uses style in the <img tag>

14:08  monkeynut: @mahen23 ... I don't use ckeditor ... but you can set those parameters with $('#myimg').attr('width', w).attr('height',h);
14:08  JKarsrud_: mahen23: Do you see this being #ckeditor?
14:08  finfin82: mekwall: ?
14:08  Blink7: hi all
14:08  Blink7: does anyone know any good tools to check IE's performance?
14:09  mahen23: i just created the #ckeditor room, feel free to join
14:09  monkeynut: @Blink7 ... stopwatch :P
14:09  JKarsrud_: mahen23: Not much help to get there then
14:09  Blink7: monkeynut: ? :P
14:09  mahen23: monkeynut: count on fingers :P
14:10  monkeynut: @Blink7 ... i'm guessing you mean performance profiling?
14:11  mahen23: i am going to contact those ckeditor dev
14:11  Blink7: monkeynut: exactly
14:11  JKarsrud_: mahen23: Why don't you just search through the files for <img> or something?
14:11  mahen23: JKarsrud: dude, i already done that
14:11  philk__: how can I force the browser to refresh the screen?
14:11  mahen23: findstr /S /M "<img" *.*
14:11  monkeynut: @Blink7 ... do you want to test your code's performance or IEs?
14:12  Cork: philk__: window.location.reload() ?
14:12  JKarsrud_: It's probably not inserted as a string
14:12  monkeynut: to test your code i'd recommend using one of the nice test-suites for firefox or chrome ... but if you want to test IE only code, that isn't going to work
14:12  Blink7: monkeynut: yes, i got lots of javascript and would like to know which piece of code or plugin is causing the bottlenecks in IE
14:12  JKarsrud_: mahen23: You'd be better off searching for "img"
14:12  mahen23: JKarsrud: whaaaaaaat?
14:12  mekwall: monkeynut, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/tnwkF/
14:12  mekwall: there it is
14:12  monkeynut: @Blink7 have you considered using something like valgrind on IE while it is running your code?
14:12  JKarsrud_: mahen23: not inserted as an html string, but rather used with document.createElement("img"). But I don't know, I've NEVER EVER used ckeditor
14:13  mekwall: ?.proxy @ finfin82
14:13 @bot-t: finfin82, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
14:13  mahen23: i am not good with maths: Answer this question to prove that you're not a bot. What is the middle number from 95372?
14:13  Blink7: monkeynut: i have never heard of it, but will give it a try, looks like it's more for processes, not sure if it will show me the exact piece of code that's slow
14:13  mekwall: finfin82, you will need to function that you pass through proxy as a callback :)
14:13  mekwall: to = a
14:13  mekwall: ol
14:14  mekwall: +l
14:14  monkeynut: @mekwall ... cheers, i'm just reading that code now :)
14:14  finfin82: mekwall: thx, i will read and try to understand ;-)
14:16  philk__: Cork: no, no window reload... I want some part of the webpage update after a XMLDocument.load call (synced, blocking)
14:17  Cork: philk__: what?
14:17  Cork: philk__: if you want something to show on the page, it needs to be part of the dom
14:21  kostodo: anyone used google maps with jquery ui tabs?
14:21  philk__: Cork: yes I know that. I have 10 calls to XMLDocument.load() and after each call I do $('#progress').text('Loaded catalog ' + catalogName); But the text is not shown on the screen. Only after the last call to XMLDocument.load returns the text is briefly visible
14:21  monkeynut: @mekwall ... thanks very much for this code.  That's a nice chunk of what I will need to write, and I like the use of objects where I would have used an array
14:21  mekwall: monkeynut, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/tnwkF/2/
14:21  monkeynut: I was hoping for a cleaner solution (like an .ajaxStop that called after events!) ... but this will have to do ....
14:21  Cork: philk__: you most lilly need to do async loop around it to let the client update
14:21  mekwall: monkeynut, updated to use array instead of object... so you don't have to name the requests
14:21  philk__: Cork: not possible in my scenario
14:21  Cork: philk__: var loop = function() { setTimeout(loop, 0); }; loop();
14:22  Cork: philk__: if you can't, then your out of luck
14:22  mekwall: monkeynut, just push them into the request array, then check if processed is set to true in the XmlHttpRequest
14:22  Cork: philk__: if you don't let the browser do anything outside your loop, it can't update
14:22  philk__: Cork: setTimeout with 0ms will give the browser time to update?
14:22  Cork: philk__: ya, as the loop will be async
14:23  Cork: it will let the browser trigger the next loop
14:23  Cork: philk__: note though, all browser has a min time of about 10 ms

14:50 @bot-t: dbugger, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/

15:06  anli_: There should be a $.implode in jquery
15:08  xotix: hi
15:09  monkeynut: hi xotix
15:09  xotix: how can i get the return value of the callback func of post or how can i change the value of a variable within the callback func?
15:10  monkeynut: how have you made the post
15:10  monkeynut: usually the first parameter of the callback is the data returned
15:10  monkeynut: e.g. $.post( "url" ,{parm: 'val'}, function(data){ //do stuff with data });
15:11  xotix: http://pastebin.com/y7JTDT0q line 2, line 73. looks like they are 2 diffrente scopes.
15:11  monkeynut: if that is your post function, then use $(data) to reference that data as a jquery object
15:11  xotix: i want to chagne a variable outside of the callback function.
15:11  monkeynut: I see ... well, you need to have the variable in scope
15:12  monkeynut: you can declar    var myvariable; before the $.post
15:12  xotix: i did
15:12  monkeynut: then you will be able to reference and modify that variable from within the callback
15:12  monkeynut: validation, Categori and drinks should be accessible to that callback function
15:13  monkeynut: (and dailogMode)
15:13  monkeynut: what exactly is the problem you are having?
15:14  xotix: after the callback, the variable validation is false. but it does get into the if.
15:15  monkeynut: yes, it will do
15:15  monkeynut: your if statement is being evaluated before the function in your callback has completed
15:16  monkeynut: this is the nature of simultaneous threads.
15:16  mekwall: anli_, not needed...
15:16  mekwall: anli_, there's .join in javascript
15:16  monkeynut: the simple solution would be to put that if statement inside the callback function
15:16  monkeynut: is there any reason you wouldn't want to do that?
15:17  monkeynut: @xotix ... bump ...
15:18  xotix: oh, hmm. once i thougth i cant do the reload in the callback so i put it outside. hmm :P but of course. ^^ at that time i had some other issues. thanks. :P thats a bad one.
15:18  xotix: thanks

15:32  monkeynut: woops
15:33  monkeynut: sorry :\
15:33  xotix: whats the div id of the header generated by datatables and how can i force the table width to be 100%? already did table css.
15:33  mekwall: no worries, that was pretty cool hehe
15:33  loxs: monkeynut, thanks

15:33  mekwall: like so many others*
15:34  monkeynut: @xotix, setting the table width will fill 100% of the containing div
15:34  monkeynut: I can quickly look up the class it uses for you
15:34  xotix: i got that with the header.
15:34  xotix: table.display, normaly.
15:34  monkeynut: but I suggest you get the firefox plugin 'firebug' and find it yourself ;)
15:34  monkeynut: datatables wraps your table in divs
15:34  monkeynut: these divs have classes e.t.c.
15:35  xotix: yeha i already have, i just found it. but i still ned the column width to be 100% of the table.
15:35  ciss: hi, i have a problem with dynamically adding/loading images to a page. they show as loaded, but their content is not displayed. http://fiddle.jshell.net/8caEH/

15:37  MrJones: hi
15:39  MrJones: given I got "<div class='lul'>  <input id='lal'> </div>", shouldn't $('#lal').parent('.lul') give me the div?
15:39  monkeynut: @ciss ... what are the get parameters q= supposed to be equal to ... in your code those parameters are set to be equal to an encodeURIComponent !!
15:39  arpegius: for text inputs in jquery mobile with a predefined value, anyone else noticing that value jump out of the input area when you try to edit?
15:39  MrJones: that worked previously for me, but now I get some strange jqeury object back for which html() is null, attr('id') and attr('class') are undefined etc... basically just nothing :( :(
15:39  MrJones: instead of the proper parent div
15:39  diamonds: how the heck is this the FIRST hit on DDG for "jquery fader" https://code.google.com/p/jqueryfader/ ?
15:39  MrJones: in firebug, the DOM looks just fine
15:40  MrJones: (parent is there, it is indeed the parent (although not the direct one) and has the right class set)
15:40  monkeynut: @MrJones ... why not just use .parent()
15:40  monkeynut: (without parameters) to give you that div parent?
15:40  ciss: monkeynut, the parameter contains the url: base64 encoded, escaped
15:40  MrJones: monkeynut: well, because that's not what I want
15:40  monkeynut: I see ... perhaps it is too long?
15:40  MrJones: I'm searching for something more up the line
15:41  MrJones: what is too long? :/ the id?
15:41  monkeynut: that was @ciss
15:41  MrJones: ok
15:41  xotix: monkeynut, my table is 100% width of my div. but my only column doesnt stretch itself to 100% of the table.
15:41  monkeynut: @ciss ... GET parameters are very limited in length (around 100+ chars)
15:41  monkeynut: are you sure this length isn't being exceeded, resulting in incomplete data?
15:42  monkeynut: @xotix, I see ... hang on
15:42  ciss: monkeynut, please read the description: accessing the images directly or embedding them statically in a page works. the src urls aren't any different.
15:43  xotix: "sScrollY": "100%", does stretch the column, but its not meant to that since it looks very ugly. looks like align left the column and then stretch t he last line of pixels :P
15:44  monkeynut: @ciss, I've read the description, i'm just trying to understand why the code doesn't work ... for example possibly encodeURI is truncating the parameter?
15:44  mekwall: ciss, http://fiddle.jshell.net/8caEH/1/
15:44  monkeynut: @ciss, in your situation i'd be using a proxy like burp to check that the URL is going through as expected when your javascript sends it
15:44  MrJones: just to be right on that: .parent('.classname') should go up the DOM tree to the parent, the parent's parent etc until it comes across an element of the class "classname", right?
15:45  mekwall: ciss, two of them work... the first proxy return 0x0 in dimensions
15:45  monkeynut: @ciss, it shouldn't be a render issue, especially since some images work with precisely the same method
15:45  monkeynut: @ciss, I think your problem should show up right away if you look at the data exchange in the history of a proxy (I use burp, it's great)
15:46  monkeynut: @MrJones no ... don't think so
15:46  monkeynut: @MrJones ... I think you want to use .closest() instead
15:47  monkeynut: adding a selector to parent is useful if you only want to select the parent if it satisfies the selector criteria ... there is always only one parent
15:47  monkeynut: (the rest are deeper ancestors)
15:47  monkeynut: .closest('selector') will keep going up the tree until it matches that selector
15:47  monkeynut: that's what you want to use

15:59  mekwall: ciss, I can't really find an explanation to it :)
16:00  ciss: mekwall,i might be able to work around that by opening the page in an iframe in the background before loading the image directly. i just need it for a short period to draw it on a canvas element.
16:01  ciss: and it's definitely the cookie.
16:01  gym_jane: hi all
16:01  gym_jane: need some help
16:01  mekwall: ciss, well... thing is... it doesn't work to link it directly either ;)
16:01  gym_jane: i am using this http://www.seangw.com/wordpress/index.php/2009/01/basic-ajax-tutorial-jquery-toggle-and-slide/
16:01  gym_jane: I have 4 divs
16:01  mekwall: ciss, I just tried to add the image directly to the html with the same result
16:02  gym_jane: how can i toggle other divs when one of them is being "show"

16:08  BillCriswell: xotix: If there's block level elements inside you need margin: 0 auto;
16:09  JKarsrud_: VERTICALLY
16:09  mjsilva: xotix: forget, http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pos_vertical-align.asp
16:09  xotix: no, i trieds auto, but without 0:)
16:09  Dr4g: gym_jane, almost there
16:09  xotix: thanks i will take a lok :)
16:09  mjsilva: xotix: or use line-height: http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_line-height.asp
16:09  monkeynut: @amereservant ... I see, missed that!   it will go through each of the elements of the fieldSelection object, and execute the function on that object ... i is the index of that object in the array
16:09 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 115 seconds
16:10  xotix: ok thx :)
16:10  gym_jane: Dr4g aww thank you every so much :)
16:10  gym_jane: ever*
16:10  monkeynut: @amereservant ... so it's adding each of those functions to the jQuery.fn array (in an each loop 'this' refers to the current element)
16:10  mekwall: ciss, have you tried coraldn?
16:11  mekwall: ciss, coralcdn*
16:11  amereservant: monkeynut: So then that's applying those functions to each element that's selected?
16:11  mjsilva: about my question anyone know if it's possible? I need to know before the change actualy happen what is the value in a input text, is there any magic in event change() that allows this?
16:11  amereservant: monkeynut: Ok, gotcha.  Thanks!
16:11  mjsilva: I belive this $(this).val() returns me the new value
16:11  monkeynut: @amereservant ... happy to help :)

16:11  amereservant: monkeynut: Is that a common way of writing jQuery functions or is that just a LEET way of doing it?
16:11  josephsaliba: hey guys ... how can i make an infinite loop with jquery
16:12  josephsaliba: I want the code to always check if a variable is set to true or false
16:12  Dr4g: gym_jane, done. 2 lines of jq :)
16:12  mjsilva: josephsaliba: why do you need jquery for that, and don't do infinite loops in javascript it'll crash the browser
16:13  mjsilva: josephsaliba: use the set_timeout funciton
16:13  gym_jane: Dr4g where?
16:13  daemon: hey all if I have an iframe on my site where I have a form, when the iframe is loading or the form is submitted how would I get a load wheel up or similiar, is there a jquery module I should be looking at in particular
16:13  Dr4g: gym_jane, http://jsfiddle.net/NCjLt/
16:13  josephsaliba: what i want to do is when the user clicks on submit ... I will post through ajax ... but as soon as he clicks the variable showLoads = true and a loading image will show
16:13  mekwall: ciss, http://www.coralcdn.org/
16:13  josephsaliba: and when the post is successful ... i'll put the showLoad = false and the loading image dissapears
16:13  Dr4g: gym_jane,  there you go, i removed the toggle_ from the <a> you click on and append that to #mydiv_ - you see ?
16:14  sean`: 1) Google, 2) "Most populair women on the web", first result 3) 7
16:14  JKarsrud_: daemon: do it in beforeSend in your ajax, and remove it on complete
16:14  daemon: got it ok JKarsrud_
16:14  gym_jane: Dr4g let me try that brb thank you btw
16:14  Dr4g: sean`, inspect this jquery i'm helping gym_jane with - can it be better? :) http://jsfiddle.net/NCjLt/
16:15  Dr4g: this was his previous non-working code: http://pastebin.com/UvKwS9iE
16:16  ciss: mekwall, haven't head of it before, thanks! do you know of more networks like this one?
16:16  mekwall: ciss, I think that's the only one I'm afraid
16:16  ciss: ok
16:17  mekwall: ciss, but they have 260 servers world-wide
16:17  mekwall: ciss, it can be slow, but it will never be down :p
16:17  gym_jane: Dr4g i want the divs to be hidden initially and then on click it should slide down
16:17  mekwall: ciss, first time load is usually slow... when it's cached it will replicate quickly
16:17  Dr4g: gym_jane, the divs are hidden innitially, see my jsfiddle there is HTML, CSS and JS in there and a Result box you can test it.
16:17  JKarsrud_: gym_jane: use slideDown() instead of show() then
16:18  JKarsrud_: in Dr4g's code
16:18  Dr4g: gym_jane, change the slideDown() on the show() on the jsfiddle page and click Run (top left) then click on your <a> on the Result box.
16:18  Dr4g: to see it change.
16:19  gym_jane: k trying it now
16:20  monkeynut: @amerservant ... It's how they're normally defined ... have a look at plugins to get a better idea
16:20  monkeynut: there are other ways ...
16:23  sean`: Dr4g, http://jsfiddle.net/NCjLt/1/
16:23  Dr4g: sean`, i like it
16:24  Dr4g: caching the divs outside was a noobie mistake by me
16:24  sean`: Dr4g, http://jsfiddle.net/NCjLt/2/
16:24  dinosaadeh: guys, can anyone check a problem i am facing on chrome.. http://sultangardens.koeinbeta.com/ I have a slideshow in the center, only on chrome captions are not showing properly.. I remove and reapply the class and it works!
16:24  gym_jane: Dr4g than you
16:24  Dr4g: sean`, he wants a slidey now, so can't use toggleClass()
16:24  Dr4g: unless you done toggleSlide() magix
16:25  Dr4g: gym_jane, you're welcome.
16:25  gym_jane: oh which one should i use?
16:25  gym_jane: btw guys this is specifically for a mobile template
16:26  Dr4g: gym_jane, doesn't matter, whatever one you like
16:26  Dr4g: does it work? use it :)
16:26  gym_jane: yes
16:26  gym_jane: thank you again :)
16:26  ciss: mekwall, there's coblitz, but it doesn't seem to be available everywhere

16:29  mekwall: ciss, it only seems to serve large files?
16:30  mekwall: ciss, "File size limits - No files smaller than 100KB or larger than 20GB are served for the general public. Exceptions are provided for PlanetLab users and for US Educational sites."
16:30  xotix: why cant i do multilines at JS? -.-.
16:31  mekwall: ciss, "We are focusing on serving large files, like ISO images, PDFs, etc. We automatically change the content type of '.iso' files to be 'application/octet-stream'. We do not serve Web pages, images, videos, or audio files for the general public."
16:31  mekwall: xotix, huh?
16:31  mekwall: xotix, multiline what?
16:32  danheberden: xotix, multiline string?
16:32  squeeks_: Err, I'm trying to set the content of an iframe to some data received, not point the iframe at some url and I'm failing. So far I've tried stuff like $('iframe').html(data); to no avail. Any suggestions?
16:32  xotix: yeah, sry. like http://pastebin.com/jU8u6H5z
16:32  Third3ye: Hey all :) trying to chose a CSS selector, the css selector for <legend> to be specific -- and I tried $("legend") with no effect
16:32  monkeynut: @xotix ... you can't do multi-line strings because javascript sux ... use + at the end of each string line
16:32  monkeynut: to concatenate them
16:33  Third3ye: Would I absoloutly have to add a class tag to the HTML, or is there some other way of adressing all <legend> blocks
16:33 @ajpiano: $("legend") ?
16:33  danheberden: xotix: http://pastebin.com/ZM2FgSkw
16:34 @ajpiano: that's strange that legend isn't working
16:34  danheberden: or xotix: http://pastebin.com/tnnm3b7u
16:34  xotix: yeah well
16:34  Third3ye: I tried that, ajpiano :/ Must be the script I'm using that's not responding correctly -- I'm using a third party script called jquery.corner.js
16:34  monkeynut: @danheberden ... didn't know you could do that ... nice tip :)
16:34 @ajpiano: malsup's corner plugin?
16:34  xotix: thanks, but why cant yxou just do it without some / + stuff. :( ^^
16:35  Third3ye: One sec, been using it for son long I can't remember ^^;;
16:35  danheberden: xotix - because in js line breaks mean end of the statement
16:35  Third3ye: Yeah, it's malsup's alright, ajpiano
16:35  danheberden: and a string declaration is a statement
16:36 @ajpiano: squeeks_ you need to do $("#iframe").contents().find("body').html("foo")
16:37  sd: I have read about cookies, and I can't figure out how to write the function which handels so the modal window doesn't appear all over again when the site is reloaded.
16:37  squeeks_: ajpiano: looking to replace more than just the body, but that's cool thanks.
16:37 @ajpiano: squeeks_ bottom line is you need .contents ()
16:38  dinosaadeh: guys how come $.delay(3000) is not working?
16:38  Mimo: thx mekwall for previews answer
16:38  squeeks_: ajpiano++ # ¡HA! ¡HA! ESTOY USANDO EL JQUERY!
16:39  monkeynut: $sd ... store a variable in the cookie called 'visited' or something and set it to true .... then check the value of that and only fire the function to show the dialogue if that value is not set or false
16:39  mekwall: Mimo, wow... that was a long time ago haha
16:39  danheberden: dinosaadeh: it's really only for queued animations - iike fade/hide 'n shit
16:39  monkeynut: if your cookie keeps getting replaced you need to change the expiry settings
16:39  danheberden: monkeynut: or put them in a better cookie jr
16:39  monkeynut: there's not a lot you can do unless they store cookies
16:40  gym_jane: Dr4g one more thing, when a div is open and i click on it it doesnt hide itself
16:40  gym_jane: basically doesnt work like a normal toggle
16:40  Mimo: mekwall: haha i know sorry  :P i had to run
16:41 @ajpiano: ?delay2 @ dinosaadeh
16:41 @bot-t: dinosaadeh, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
16:41  KucukMubasir: guys, when you use jquery along with RoR, do you use RoR's helper methods or JQuery's native methods?
16:41 @ajpiano: Third3ye, selectng $("legend") definitely works: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/ZSzLH/
16:41  dinosaadeh: danheberden: thanks
16:41  danheberden: or you could reference the docs :p
16:41  dinosaadeh: ajpiano: thanks ^.^
16:41  Third3ye: Oy :P something wrong with my coding then ^^;; I will check it some more, thanks for the dilligence ajpiano :D *thumbs up*
16:42  KucukMubasir: any help?
16:42  mekwall: Mimo, what exactly did I help you with? :P
16:43  Mimo: haha ajax call and cache (but still wondering if i cashe my ajax call it won't put an other request?

16:45  KucukMubasir: netbeans
16:45  mekwall: Mimo, if you don't want it to do another call you need to have your own checks :)
16:45  pensfan: is there a way to create a new div, add my click handler, then append it where i want it to go?
16:46  Mimo: so should (performance) i include it in a var? or make that cache call mekwall
16:46  xotix: will take a look thx
16:46  Mimo: because it's static html

16:47  ciss: mekwall, sorry, seems i have skimmed it too fast. by the way, those proxies only check the referrer, the iframe strategy works. check this with referers disabled. http://fiddle.jshell.net/Ym9rc/
16:51  mekwall: ciss, don't you want to automate that?
16:51  mekwall: ciss, it's a really ugly solution anyway haha
16:52  ciss: who are you telling ... :)
16:52  monkeynut: @danheberden ... no cookie jar is safe from me! :P
16:53  mekwall: ciss, well there's no other way I guess... but still... that's not really usable :D
16:53  ciss: mekwall, it is, for my use case :)

16:59  danheberden: xotix - you're on pc?
16:59  JKarsrud_: xotix: Okay, I was about to suggest WebIDE, but then that's too big too
17:00  xotix: yeah. in a few months i get a mac, but at the moment i need something good for pc. since im a beginner i rly dont use too much stuff.
17:00  xotix: *need

17:00 @bot-t: JKarsrud_, E - TextEditor | The power of TextMate on Windows - http://www.e-texteditor.com/
17:00  danheberden: xotix, something simple would be notepad++
17:00  danheberden: or ya, e editor or vim
17:00  JKarsrud_: If you need an ide, it will never be really tiny
17:00  xotix: mhm thansk will try them
17:00  JKarsrud_: if you need a text editor
17:00  JKarsrud_: notepad is win
17:01  monkeynut: notepad++ is very good ... +1 that suggestion ..
17:02  JKarsrud_: Hmm, reminds me. I need to install VMWare on thismac
17:03  monkeynut: @JKarsrud ... I hope that's to run linux/BSD and not windows!
17:03  JKarsrud_: Both really
17:03  JKarsrud_: I "need" Windows for work
17:03  danheberden: monkeynut: how else are us mac folk supposed to test ie?
17:03  JKarsrud_: And I need IE, as danheberden points out
17:04  gym_jane: ok and now for mobile detection
17:04  danheberden: if they got spoon to work on mac
17:04  danheberden: i would be so so so happy
17:04  gym_jane: is there any recommended script for  mobile detection?

17:06  asdf2345: can anyone teach me a way i can use a directory as an image repository for a rotating banner?
17:06  JKarsrud_: orl
17:06  monkeynut: @danheberden ... if i'm asked to test it in IE I tell them I don't like coding for IE :P
17:06  JKarsrud_: monkeynut: There's a good deal of money in coding for IE
17:06  Michael: and... if you don't code for IE you are pretty much shooting yourself in the foot
17:07  JKarsrud_: If we need to support IE down to IE6, we usually add 100-150 hours
17:07  danheberden: monkeynut: if you don't have to, congrats :) my clients require their sites to run for everybody
17:07  JKarsrud_: on the estimate
17:07  danheberden: JKarsrud_: ya, ie6 support brings up the invoice quite a bit
17:07  JKarsrud_: yeah
17:07  adamaig: i thought that was what chromeframe was for ....

17:10  dsdeiz: anyone knows a nice jquery plugin similar to jquery_scroller but works with 1.2.x?
17:10  JKarsrud_: whoa, why are you on 1.2.x?
17:10  JKarsrud_: That's like...
17:10  JKarsrud_: old
17:10  JKarsrud_: as hell
17:11  dsdeiz: yeah, it comes with a cms that i'm using
17:11  JKarsrud_: Which cms is that? :o
17:11  monkeynut: @danheberden ... internal web app, I get to tell everyone they have to use firefox or chrome :)
17:12  monkeynut: @dsdeiz ... I strongly recommend upgrading your jquery to 1.4 instead
17:12  pensfan: $('<div class="scan_item">' + scan.DisplayName + '</div>').appendTo('#host_view_scans').click(function(){ShowScan()}); ... can anyone tell me why this isn't working?
17:12  monkeynut: at worst you may have to change the odd selector
17:12  JKarsrud_: Yay, found my Win7 iso, off to install that + VS2010 then
17:12  monkeynut: but it is a lot more bug resillient, faster and compatible ... usually extremely easy to use 1.4 instead of 1.2
17:13  danheberden: pensfan: post a working demo into jsfiddle.net
17:13  monkeynut: sometimes you can literally just point to the new jquery.js
17:13  monkeynut: @pensfan, what is the effect you are trying to achieve
17:14  JKarsrud_: dsdeiz: listen to monkeynut, though you'll probably run into some issues, but maybe not :)
17:14  pensfan: monkeynut, add a clickable div to another div
17:14  dsdeiz: hm, yeah. though it'll conflict with the js that the cms is using
17:14  dsdeiz: so i guess upgrading isn't an option for me :(
17:16  dsdeiz: i could also prolly use jscroller though it scrolls too fast :D
17:16  monkeynut: @pensfan ... I think it's best to do:
17:16  monkeynut: var obj = $('<div class="scan_item">...');
17:16  monkeynut: obj.appendTo(blah).click(blah);
17:16  JKarsrud_: dsdeiz: What CMS are you using, that seems wack
17:17  monkeynut: otherwise I think it tries to treat the string as a selector, which won't match anything ...
17:17  dsdeiz: it's drupal though it has an update for jquery but only upto 1.3 and it seems to be buggy when used with other plugins for the cms
17:17  danheberden: monkeynut: you can also do $('<div />', { class: "scan_item", click: function() { } });
17:17  JKarsrud_: doh, I was about to say that danheberden
17:17  JKarsrud_: :(
17:17  danheberden: über sneakyness
17:18  JKarsrud_: That's what I get for installing a vm :(
17:18  monkeynut: @danheberden ... nice suggestion ... guess it depends what paradigm you're most comfortable with
17:18  JKarsrud_: danheberden: though class should be 'class'
17:18  JKarsrud_: or "class" even
17:19  danheberden: well, actually should be className
17:19  JKarsrud_: uhm, yeah
17:19  danheberden: but native js objects don't need "name" or 'name'
17:19  JKarsrud_: but if you say "class"
17:19  danheberden: then it's "class"y?
17:19  JKarsrud_: yeah, clazzy!
17:19  JKarsrud_: it's shorter :P
17:20  danheberden: but class: "whatever" works
17:20  sean`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnWTwmoUi4c&feature=player_embedded
17:20  sean`: Are you born awesome?
17:20  danheberden: jq fixes that mistake for ya
17:20  danheberden: heh heh
17:20  JKarsrud_: danheberden: okay, I have gotten errors on that before, but I guess it might be fixed now
17:21  danheberden: hmm - maybe not in init then?
17:21  JKarsrud_: Either way, I usually do "" around stuff that are attributes
17:21  JKarsrud_: to easily see which are attributes and which are functions/methods
17:21  danheberden: JKarsrud_: the json gods thus smile upon you
17:22  geneller: hi there, i want to show the options for a dropdown, in firefox that happen if when focus you press keys "Alt + down" how can i do that using jquery ?
17:22  danheberden: geneller: alert("Can you please either click on the select box or press alt-down when focused on it? thanks and love you!");
17:22  JKarsrud_: danheberden: yeah! I love it
17:23  danheberden: past that, uh, it's a big uh uh
17:23  geneller: hi danheberden , yes, click its enough too, but i want to do that on ready()
17:24  geneller: i tried $('select').trigger('click');
17:24  JKarsrud_: geneller: .trigger('click')
17:24  JKarsrud_: Ory
17:24  JKarsrud_: orly
17:24  danheberden: geneller: what i'm trying to elude to, is that you cannot
17:24  geneller: it does not work
17:24  danheberden: you can NOT trigger NATIVE interactions
17:24  danheberden: you can bind shit to dom elements, and 'trigger' clicks 'n shit which will fire your handlers
17:24  danheberden: but you can't, say, click on a link for a user
17:25  danheberden: or open a select for them
17:25  geneller: oh, ok, thanks danheberden
17:25  danheberden: or even open a input[type="file"] for them
17:25  danheberden: now if you had some sort of js select menu implemention
17:25  danheberden: then you could show _that_
17:25  danheberden: because it's a generated thing anyway
17:27  monkeynut: just out of curiosity ... what happens if you $('select').focus() it ?
17:27  monkeynut: does it just higlight blue or does it expand? I can't remember .... either way, it's not generally something to mess around with, you probably want to get the effect a different way
17:28  geneller: just highlight, but the options are not shown
17:29  geneller: i tried too :  $('select').children().show();
17:29  geneller: but neither
