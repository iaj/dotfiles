00:06  yn: Noob javascript question that seems to recur often, but I still don't know the answer: i have a map/object return by $(document).data("something") How do I tell the number of key/value pairs in that something?
00:16  skonet: anyone know why doesn't this work? $("#cancel_button").click(function() { $(this).closest("td").empty(); }
00:17  Kindari|work: skonet: create a live example on jsfiddle.net
00:20  paul_irish: looks like it shoudl!
00:20  mekwall: evenin'
00:21  skonet: trying to figure out how to jsfiddle.net works, but yeah, that seems to just empty the text out of the input type='text' and leave the buttons when I call it... no idea why
00:22  paul_irish: sup mekwall
00:22  mekwall: hiya paul
00:22  paul_irish: skonet: so try .children().remove() instead
00:23  p3lim: anyone here with photoshop or something that can create something _really_ simple for me?

00:27  haroldini: how do i find the closest parent li to an item?
00:27  into`: i get always xmlParser not defined
00:27  paul_irish: haroldini: guess what the method is named
00:27  haroldini: .find
00:28  johan_bouveng: paul_irish
00:28  haroldini: or .parent?

01:12  Hopsy: ajpiano: are you not interested to follow me?
01:17  paul_irish: aww
01:17  mekwall: paul. its beer time!
01:21  paul_irish: damn straight
01:40  into`: when i iterate through an array: i get for each element: [Object { name="name of the object", more...}] ... but $(this).name gives me undefined, why?
01:42  darcyclarke: into` can you give an example on jsfiddle.net
01:45  into`: http://www.jsfiddle.net/2ySGb/ darcyclarke
01:45  destinydriven: into`: are you sure that $(this) is what you think it is?
01:46  into`: i think and hope it is an object from type of "Section"
01:46  destinydriven: do a console.log($(this));
01:46  into`: line numbers would be nice on jsfiddle
01:47  darcyclarke: a working example would be wicked
01:47  into`: console.log($(this)); //[Object { name="Einführung", more...}]
01:47  into`: console.log($(this).name); //undefined
01:50  destinydriven: have you tried $(this).name[0] . . .
01:50  darcyclarke: into` this.name
01:51  into`: ahhhhhhhhhh
01:51  into`: thx, very nice
01:51  darcyclarke: no problemo
01:51  destinydriven: which one worked?
01:52  into`: this.name works
01:52  darcyclarke: ;)
01:52  destinydriven: the other doesn't? :P
01:52  darcyclarke: its not a jquery object your passing into .each(0 right?
01:53  darcyclarke: just an array of objects?
01:53  Rogi: is there a way to get parent('.class') as well as parent('.class').siblings('.class') ?
01:54  destinydriven: .parent() ?

01:56  darcyclarke: yea... so this.name makes more sense ;0
01:56  darcyclarke: ;)
01:56  int_64: hello, question about the scrollable class in Jquery UI....is there some max number of elements?
01:56  destinydriven: into`: ahh ok cool
01:57  int_64: I am buiolding a image gallery, and if I have more than 25 or so elements, the thing acts very erratic
01:57  int_64: I have it so that each image is in its own div
01:57  int_64: so scrolling simply shows 1 more image..so about 30 div "items"
01:57  into`: to create html elements with jquery, i need an plugin or can do this with the core of jquery? $.create(..) is undefined
01:58  int_64: when you get to the 24th, I believe, it starts scrolling really fast without my control until it hits the end
01:58  RomD: into`: $('<div id="#hi" />').appendTo('body');
01:59  RomD: no # of course
02:00  into`: ok, but i would like to create an ul list with li's: var ul = $('<ul id="blub">'); ul.append($('<li>bla</li>'); but how to close the ul tag
02:01  RomD: into`: you don't have to
02:01  LazyMukke: is there anyway to check if an element exists ? (by id)
02:01  RomD: LazyMukke: $('#foobar').length > 0
02:01  LazyMukke: aha
02:02 --- robertm is now known as rsm
02:02 --- rsm is now known as rsmeineke
02:02  LazyMukke: i thought there was something like $chk() but that is possibly another framework
02:02  into`: ok nice RomD
02:03  l4rk: LazyMukke: .length is the fastest and best way to check
02:04  LazyMukke: ok
02:04  l4rk: if($("div").length) // exists
02:04  l4rk: if (!$('div').length) // doesn't exist
02:04  LazyMukke: kk
02:04  LazyMukke: thx
02:08  DTrejo: hello
02:14  hobophobe: Is there a convenient way to add .next() to the current stack?  Something like $('.foo').pushStack($('.foo').next()) but without the redundant selection?
02:15  conee: easy question, but i couldn't find an answer on the jquery api docs.  what does .val() return if an input box is empty?
02:19  hobophobe: conee: An empty string.
02:21  trend: how much slower do you'll thnk $("a[rel='abc']") is from$("#abc") ?
02:22  trend: I'm trying to think of a good way to select multiple nodes w/o using .classname
02:22  hobophobe: It'll depend on how many anchors, but it definitely will be slower if a lot of them.
02:23  hobophobe: Why not use a class?
02:23  rroelofs: trend: $("#abc") is mapped directly to getElementById, it is a lot faster
02:23  trend: :/ just wondering if it is going to be a lot slower than getElementByClassName() actualy
02:24  ProLoser|Work: hello people
02:24  trend: yeah, sorry, didn't word the question well. I know id is fastest, then class, then name (in newer browsers), but just not sure about a random attribute
02:24  trend: selector
02:24  ProLoser|Work: i need some assistance: http://jsfiddle.net/HmfUZ/ i want to only enable the find button when both selects have values
02:24 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
02:24  hobophobe: trend, the more specific you can be it will be faster... if there are a lot of anchors it will be slower, etc.
02:24  ProLoser|Work: actually, i'll need to slide the third select set into view, and THEN after they all have values enable it
02:25  ProLoser|Work: the question is what should go in my if statement? do i have to reselect the dom or is using $(this) enough?
02:25  trend: hobo, good point.. I guess it will just be a try and see if it works fine situation .. thanks :0
02:27  ProLoser|Work: anyone mind helping me?
02:27  danheberden: ProLoser|Work: ya, gimme a sec
02:27  hobophobe: ProLoser|Work: What if they add a value then remove it?
02:28  ProLoser|Work: need it to be re-disabled
02:28  ProLoser|Work: the arrangement of code should suffice, i only have to throw in the proper 'if' check
02:28 --- rue|sorry is now known as rue
02:29  ProLoser|Work: hobophobe: actually you have a point i'll probably need an else
02:29  user_corrupt: <JS n00b: when I use a certain mootools plugin, then a jquery pluging that I am using fails...I've tried to resolve the conflict by replacing "$" with "jQuery" and also "$j", but that also fails...here is the page with the script that I am trying to fix (slideshow), and here is a codepaste if someone can please tell me how to fix this: http://www.pastie.org/1276297
02:29  danheberden: ProLoser|Work: sounds like you got it figured out
02:29  ProLoser|Work: danheberden: i don't have the if statement figured out
02:29  ProLoser|Work: that's what i'm asking for help with
02:29  danheberden: btw, it should be attr('disabled', true)
02:31  ProLoser|Work: how can i evaluate that all selected elements have values?
02:32  chealer: hi. I'm trying to use .submit() with return false to prevent the action, but it's submitting anyway and I don't see any JavaScript error. what happens to the submit element's onclick handler if there's a submit function binded? does it execute? after, before?
02:34  user_corrupt: http://www.petarivcec.com/camilopardo.com/
02:34  user_corrupt: is the page that i meant to post
02:34  user_corrupt: slideshow is having conflict with mootools
02:35  user_corrupt: tried to replace "$" with $j and "jQuery", but  no joy
02:35  user_corrupt: please help, javascript n00b
02:37  deafferret: user_corrupt: I haven't used mootools, sorry.
02:38  danheberden: wtf he left?
02:38  int_64: another question...Is it pretty simple to bind scroll wheel actions to other events?
02:38  int_64: I have a plugin that scrolls through this gallery upon mouseover event
02:38  elTigre: hey, I am having big trouble diagnosing a problem. In certain circumstances inside several layers of event handling,  the $ object changes to something that mostly returns null when it clearly shouldn't
02:39  int_64: Is there some tutorial that tells me how to easily hook these actions to the scroll wheel?
02:39  danheberden: ?tell ProLoser|Work  http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/HmfUZ/4/
02:39  bot-t: danheberden, Okay.
02:39  elTigre: function ()
02:39  elTigre:     {
02:39  elTigre:         return document.getElementById.apply(document, arguments)
02:39  elTigre:     }
02:39  danheberden: ?p @ elTigre
02:39  bot-t: elTigre, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
02:40  elTigre: that's what $ looks like when debugging the problem
02:40  danheberden: not multiline pastes here in chat
02:41  hobophobe: int_64 there's a plugin that may help? http://plugins.jquery.com/project/mousewheel
02:41  int_64: ah nice..thanks
02:42  hobophobe: err, look at http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/mousewheel the one I linked may be stale
02:42  int_64: ok
02:42  elTigre: so no idea=
02:43  danheberden: elTigre: you running other libraries?
02:43  destinydriven: danheberden: I tried another not so elegant solution: http://jsfiddle.net/HmfUZ/5/
02:44  elTigre: none that I'd know would use $
02:44  danheberden: destinydriven: whoa
02:44  destinydriven: heh, overkill
02:44  elTigre: I already tried removing pretty much any other js files, but probably I have to be more thorough in that
02:46  danheberden: elTigre: looks like prototype
02:46  danheberden: or some other library
02:47  danheberden: if it's jquery, console.log( $.prototype.jquery ) will evaluate to the version number
02:47  danheberden: try using jQuery instead of $ and see if you yield better results
02:50  elTigre: danheberden: hm good to know. I am not the only programmer on that project, so I wouldn't know if someone hid away some prototype code... I'll try searching for that
02:51  danheberden: seems a bit simple for prototype - or really old, the prototype function is http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/5pVnt/
02:57  user_corrupt: $20 for anyone who can fix this jquery conflict with mootols
02:57  user_corrupt: should take like 5 mins for one of you guys
02:57  user_corrupt: and maybe i will learn something
02:57  rmurphey: do we get to know what the problem is?
02:57  rmurphey: or do we just get to guess
02:58  rmurphey: if the latter, i bet the answer is jQuery.noConflict()
02:58  conee: hobophobe: hey sorry was afk for a little, the problem i'm running into is that instead of returning an empty string i get undefined
03:00  conee: hobophone: i'm doing a check on an input box with .change(), and sometimes i get "" as the return for an empty input from .val(), but sometimes i get an undefined string
03:00  rmurphey: ?paste @ conee
03:00  bot-t: conee, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
03:01  rmurphey: ?noconflict @ user_corrupt
03:01  bot-t: user_corrupt, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
03:01  p3lim: is it possible to make a script replace the class tag within an element once the width of the text line has reached x pixels?
03:02  p3lim: got issues with line-height, so that would probably fix it
03:02  user_corrupt: rmurphey: yeah, i bet that is solution, Im quite inept with JS, but I tried replacing "$" with "$j", and also "jQuery", but no joy...here is the page with the failed jQuery slideshow: http://www.petarivcec.com/camilopardo.com/ and here is a pastie of the code im using:  http://www.pastie.org/1276297
03:03  conee: rmurphey, hobophobe: http://jsfiddle.net/t84Lg/
03:05  danheberden: user_corrupt: so why not wrap that in a (function($) { /* your slide show init here /* })(jQuery); block
03:06  user_corrupt: danheberden: Im inept at JS
03:06  user_corrupt: but will read a good book on it soon
03:07  danheberden: http://www.learningjquery.com/
03:07  user_corrupt: i was gonna go with the eloquent javascript book
03:07  user_corrupt: really like the writing style
03:07  user_corrupt: are you familiar with it?
03:08  danheberden: best book: javascript the good parts
03:08  danheberden: though, you might want to let that be your 2nd read
03:08  danheberden: not familiar with any getting started books
03:09  conee: rmurphey: any ideas?
03:11  user_corrupt: danheberden: here is how I tried wrapping that: http://www.pastie.org/1276340 no joy
03:11  danheberden: user_corrupt: if jQuery is undefined, then there's something getting in it's way
03:12  danheberden: either a failed script before it, or for whatever horrible only-god-knows reason it's being overwritten (highly unlikely)
03:12  danheberden: $ will be overwritten, sure
03:12  danheberden: but not jQuery
03:12  danheberden: though not sure with the word 'block' in your code there
03:13  danheberden: what do you get if you console.log(jQuery)
03:13  user_corrupt: danheberden: how do i do that precisely? will google now
03:14  danheberden: use firefox with firebug or chrome dev tools
03:14  danheberden: in your script tag, put console.log(jQuery);
03:15  danheberden: in the console of the dev tool (firebug has a 'console' tab, chrome too) you'll see the item
03:15  danheberden: whether it be undefined, a function, etc - you can click on it to dig deeper
03:17 --- webflo1 is now known as webflo
03:17  danheberden: user_corrupt: you with me still?
03:17  danheberden: i just saw the link you posted to the production site
03:17  user_corrupt: $("#slideshow").crossSlide is not a function
03:17  danheberden: or, er, public site
03:17  danheberden: yup
03:17  danheberden: you saw it
03:17  danheberden: and jQuery is runing fine
03:18  danheberden: albeit not $ but jQuery
03:19  danheberden: so user_corrupt wanna know something interesting?
03:19  user_corrupt: yap
03:19  danheberden: the script you're loading on top
03:19  danheberden: is jquery 1.4.3
03:19  danheberden: but in console, if you look at jQuery.fn.jquery
03:19  danheberden: it prints 1.4.2
03:19  danheberden: care to guess what that means?
03:19  user_corrupt: hmm
03:20  user_corrupt: im perplexed
03:20  danheberden: it means you're downloading 1.4.3 up top
03:20  danheberden: and somewhere, it's getting replaced with 1.4.2
03:20  danheberden: so you load up 1.4.3
03:20  danheberden: it adds the pluging
03:20  danheberden: *plugin
03:20  danheberden: then you load 1.4.2
03:20  danheberden: and jQuery is overwritten
03:20  user_corrupt: i guess its a wordpress thing?
03:20  danheberden: line 31
03:21  danheberden: probably
03:21  danheberden: not big on wordpress theming
03:21  danheberden: but that's the issue
03:21  user_corrupt: at least its been narrowed down, thanks

03:28  bobbobbins: question...im using a jquery watcher to change the css of a div...but then i have a pulldown that reloads the div, and the changes i just made went away, but i'd like to keep them, is there a way to do that?
03:29  bobbobbins: will live() work in that case?

03:29  bobbobbins: i feel like it won't
03:29  danheberden: user_corrupt: below where you call jquery, run <script> jQuery.noConflict(); </script>
03:29  danheberden: that will assign $ back to mootools
03:30  danheberden: bobbobbins: "the changes i just made went away" - a bit unclear, can you paste your code?
03:30  danheberden: throw it on jsfiddle.net
03:32  bobbobbins: http://pastebin.com/WEb10iDV
03:32  bobbobbins: too late
03:32  bobbobbins: its real simple though
03:33  danheberden: so what's #switch_list?
03:33  danheberden: there's no markup in the paste for context
03:33  bobbobbins: when #switch_list is clicked i make those changes...but if i reload the div they're in...they go back to their original settings
03:33  bobbobbins: its a button
03:33  danheberden: by reload, you mean replace it's contents
03:33  bobbobbins: yeah, with load()

03:53  Lumpio-: <script src="/includes/jquery.js" type="text/javascript" />
03:53  Lumpio-: Browsers don't like XHTML syntax unless you tell them to do so.

03:54  surferchick12: Does the Doctype not count as an XHTML declaration?
03:55  prgmrBill: just close the script tag like this instead </script>

03:58  surferchick12: Working, thanks for the quick response guys <3
03:58  vladikoff: surferchick12, http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()
03:58  vladikoff: surferchick12, enjoy!
03:59  surferchick12: I used to use $(document).ready(function() { }); in all my jQuery code but then I noticed that some code works without it so just got lazy/stopped
04:00  danheberden: surferchick12: any code that relys on a dom node needs to be in a ready function
04:00  danheberden: you put $('#myCoolElement').whatever() above that element actually loading in the dom, and you're fuxored
04:23 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
04:24  destinydriven: how do I turn an input field into a hidden input? say I have $('#ElemId').attr('hidden', true);
04:25  deafferret: .attr('type', 'hidden')    ?
04:25  destinydriven: ahh ok
04:27  destinydriven: hmm, that didn't work
04:29  RobW: you can't change it i don't believe.. but you can create an element within the form with type hidden and just copy data from the element you wanted to make hidden, then just delete the old element
04:30  danheberden: RobW++
04:30  destinydriven: RobW: :(
04:31  destinydriven: i'm importing a form with .load() , I just need to hide the id field
04:31  danheberden: $('#yourIdField').hide()
04:31  danheberden: boom done
04:31  destinydriven: why didn't I think of that
04:32  danheberden: because you don't have a tasty texas whopper in front of you
04:32  RobW: but if you hide it I don't think it'll post its data
04:32  RobW: check it.
04:33  destinydriven: worked like a charm lol, yeah not having a whopper sucks too
04:33  RobW: ok so you can post from a hidden field from .hide()?
04:33  destinydriven: RobW: I think you're right
04:34  destinydriven: the operation is still failing, though it could be something else
04:34  RobW: try just changing its css
04:34  RobW: $("#elem").css({"position":"absolute","left":"-9999px"});
04:34  RobW: haha
04:34  RobW: although i'm sure there's gotta be a better resolution than that
04:35  destinydriven: or just have a class for that and addClass('disappear')  lol
04:36  danheberden: RobW - you're right
04:36  destinydriven: I suspect I have other issues than the hidden field, it fails even when the id field is not hidden
04:36  destinydriven: haven't worked on that code for almost a month and I'm just trying to get back into that mindspace ..  hate when that happens
04:37  danheberden: var $input = $('#yourinput'); $input.after( $('<input type="hidden" />').val( $input.val() ) ).remove();
04:37  Lumpio-: I wish there was a jQuery function to just create an element
04:38  Lumpio-: I feel so dirty doing $("<span />")
04:38  Lumpio-: ...or $.create = function(name) { return $(document.createElement(name); };
04:38  danheberden: well createElement('span') isn't THAT much different
04:38  Lumpio-: $(document.createElement("span")) is a bit long ¬_¬
04:39  danheberden: i mean instead of <span />
04:39  Lumpio-: eh
04:39  danheberden: $('<span />', { id: 'zomg', className: 'whoohoo' } );
04:39  danheberden: seems classy
04:40  coldhead: Lumpio-: $.create = function (sowhat) {return $('<' + sowhat + '>')}; $span = $.create('span');
04:41  danheberden: should be called $.justForLumpio
04:41  chrismcintosh: is there a way to detect if a url get parameter or address has changes
04:41  chrismcintosh: i know you can detect a hash tag change
04:41  astropirate: anyone use the fullCalendar plugin? i'm using it inside a tab widget and it isnt' rendering. It's hidden
04:41  Lumpio-: Sounds great
04:42  Lumpio-: chrismcintosh: Changing the URL will (nearly always) cause a page reload
04:42  destinydriven: danheberden: your code works at hiding the field but I end up with an unidentified hidden input field
04:42  danheberden: oh, right
04:42  danheberden: copy the name too
04:42  chrismcintosh: Lumpio-: changing the hash tag does not
04:42  destinydriven: k
04:42  danheberden: Lumpio-: history.pushState
04:43  Lumpio-: danheberden: I know, I know, hence the "nearly always"
04:43  danheberden: ya, but that'd be the only case
04:43  danheberden: for his problem
04:43  Lumpio-: I'd say the amount of people who know of pushState is still low (let alone the amount of people who actually use it)
04:43  danheberden: otherwise, it'd be a new page
04:43  Lumpio-: ...I doubt he's using pushState
04:44  danheberden: heh, well i wasn't gonna be THAT bold :p
04:44  danheberden: hahaha
04:44  chrismcintosh: okay the situation i have is this
04:44  chrismcintosh: i have a drupal install
04:44  danheberden: every time i assume the devs level, i get attacked for not going into every possible detail
04:44  Lumpio-: oh no it's PHP we're doomed
04:44  chrismcintosh: and it navigates using something like index.php?q=
04:44  danheberden: "WHY DIDNT YOU SAY _______?!?!?!?!?!?!?! ZOMG!!"
04:44  Lumpio-: danheberden: I'll start doing the opposite then
04:44  skonet: they have a good point
04:45  danheberden: hahaha
04:45  danheberden: you kids tryin' to push ma buttuns - i sees what you're doin
04:45  Lumpio-: "geez, stop overestimating people, it's too much to expect all developers to know of complex concepts such as objects these days"
04:45  danheberden: "or let alone google the fucking thing"
04:45  chrismcintosh: i was wanting to find out what when the ?q= changes or if i can change it without a page reload
04:45  Lumpio-: "They're the people who get the job done, but you can't expect them to be smart"
04:46  Lumpio-: Well, you can tell that the query string has (possibly) changed /when the page starts all over again/
04:46  chrismcintosh: actually i have been googling
04:46  Lumpio-: If you want to change it without a page reload you'll have to pushState ¬_¬
04:46  danheberden: uh oh, i goggled
04:46  Lumpio-: (Which only works in few browsers)
04:46  danheberden: *googled
04:46 * danheberden looks bashful
04:47  chrismcintosh: well i gues i could keep updating hash tags,
04:47  danheberden: mmm now for the whopper jr
04:47  chrismcintosh: thanks though was just trying to see if there was a way
04:47  danheberden: it thought it was gonna survive in tehre
04:48  danheberden: but no, it's gonna get eated
04:48  Lumpio-: no fair, you get burger kings :<
04:48  danheberden: with drupal, almost nothing is imposible
04:48  danheberden: is that how the saying goes?
04:48  danheberden: well i had to drives all the way there
04:48  danheberden: and almost got hit by a cop
04:48  danheberden: effing retarded woman
04:49  Lumpio-: At least yours is in the same /country/
04:49  danheberden: :(
04:49  danheberden: i'll send you a whopper
04:49  Lumpio-: I'm pretty sure you can only send McDonald's through the mail
04:50  Lumpio-: Other stuff tends to go bad in the process
04:50  danheberden: hahaha
04:50  Lumpio-: But not to be afraid! They're planning on opening some restaurants here
04:50  Lumpio-: In the near-ish future
04:50  chrismcintosh: okay so if i cant change it
04:51  chrismcintosh: nevermind just answered my question
05:12  astropirate: anyone use the fullCalendar plugin? i'm using it inside a tab widget and it isnt' rendering. It's hidden
05:21  astropirate: is there a callback function for show()? once it's done with the animation?
05:25  coldhead: ?show
05:25  bot-t: .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
05:25  coldhead: apparently so
05:25  coldhead: .show( duration, [ callback ] )
05:31  astropirate: ahh ok, thanks

06:32  Guest90995: cool
06:32  paul_irish: Guest90995: you want us to do your homework for you?
06:32  Guest90995: so
06:32  Guest90995: no no
06:32  Guest90995: I am stuck
06:32  paul_irish: sounds like it
06:32  gkatsev: also, what kind of programming class has an assignment in jQuery?
06:32  paul_irish: also plz /nick back to richardface
06:32  Guest90995: how do I do that paul

06:33  gkatsev: paul_irish: /say :)
06:34  gkatsev: benkulbertis: shouldn't callback have a value in the url?

06:35  destinydriven: Guest90995: type /nick Richard
06:35 --- Guest90995 is now known as Richard
06:35 --- Richard is now known as RichardE
06:35  RichardE: hi
06:35  RichardE: cool
06:35  RichardE: ok so --
06:36  RichardE: it's a mock ecommerce site, and when you mouse over the little square divs for the products I have made it is supposed to turn the img into a span I made with a "description" within that div
06:36  RichardE: I figured it out with javascript but now we have to redo the assignment with jquery
06:36  RichardE: and I am a bit lost
06:36  RichardE: whether to use toggle or mouseover/mouseout
06:36  RichardE: show/hide
06:37  RichardE: does that make sense?
06:40  RichardE: anyone ?
06:41  benkulbertis: Anybody interested in helping find why my $.getJSON request returns nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/nfrek/
06:42  destinydriven: is there a way to add data to something like $('form.editForm').serialize() ??   I want to pass a table row id with that
06:44  destinydriven: RichardE: you'll get more attention if you jsfiddle some code
06:44  RichardE: what does that mean
06:45  destinydriven: paste your test code here http://jsfiddle.net with the minimal stuff required to reproduce your problem
06:47  paul_irish: $.extend({}, { otherthing : 'yahhh'}, $(form).serialize() );
06:47  paul_irish: destinydriven: ^
06:47  destinydriven: paul_irish: thanks
06:47  paul_irish: ?ajax101 @ benkulbertis
06:47  bot-t: benkulbertis, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png
06:49  benkulbertis: @paul_irish thanks paul, ran into this before. thanks for the help.
06:50  paul_irish: RichardE: you'll probably use .mouseenter
06:51  carbonhat: Hi all! Can anyone tell me why my if statement isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/UAqXK/ The code inside the if statement is being executed whether the checkbox is checked or not.
06:51  RichardE: I ahve it set up like this http://jsfiddle.net/e4tjB/ -- but when I hover over any one of the shapes it is replacing all of the images inside the divs with teh description divs
06:51  RichardE: but I just want it to do 1 at at time
06:51  RichardE: if that makes sense?
06:52  RichardE: how do I limit the jquery to just do the mouseoever event for tha tparticular div rahter than all of them
06:52  danheberden: carbonhat: you have nextAll and a boolean check
06:52  danheberden: and with no markup in your paste
06:53  danheberden: i can only assume you're confusing next with nextall? or you think it'll automatically loop? or that vaginasours will attack the earth?
06:54  destinydriven: RichardE: you didn't include any html in your paste
06:54  RichardE: oh sorry 1 sec!
06:55  RichardE: http://jsfiddle.net/e4tjB/1/
06:55  destinydriven: put the relevant css too if its required
06:55  RichardE: oh
06:55  danheberden: and ffs put some cloths on!
06:55  danheberden: *clothes
06:56  RichardE: would it be ok if I uploaded the project and showed you the website?
06:57  carbonhat: danheberden - i added some markup to my jsfiddle -- and yes, i do have some suspicions about vaginasours, along with a propensity for confusing nextAll and next.
06:57  EverettZ: I searched for jQuery UI bugs and clicked on a couple, but keep getting "irc://freenode/drupal-contribut"
06:57  EverettZ: argh
06:57  EverettZ: sorry, Invalid Changeset Number
06:58  danheberden: um.. carbonhat.. why do you have style settings in your class attribute?
06:58  carbonhat: danheberden - unfortunately, a simple swap from nextAll to next didn't do the trick
06:58  RichardE: destinydriven - http://onepotcooking.com/richardespinosa/ecommercejquery/
06:59  RichardE: it's the mouseover on the shapes that I am having trouble with
06:59  danheberden: carbonhat  there is no class called universal-font-master
06:59  carbonhat: danheberden - those aren't actually in the code, that snippet is extracted from FireBug
07:00  carbonhat: danheberden - i'll get more thorough in my jsfiddle -- my original source is a mix of PHP and HTML, so it's a bit tricky to copy/paste something legible -- the mixed code screws up syntax highlighting in jsfiddle
07:00  carbonhat: but essentially, all finer points aside, i'm trying to say "if the next checkbox in this form is checked, do stuff.....if the next checkbox is NOT checked, don't do stuff"
07:00  danheberden: and whats with getting the id and using that to make the selector?
07:01  danheberden: just do var $uni_font = $(this);
07:01  danheberden: var $uni_font  $(this), uni_font_value = $uni_font.val();
07:03  RichardE: ?
07:04  carbonhat: danheberden - I tidied up my markup a bit on jsfiddle to make it clearer - http://jsfiddle.net/UAqXK/3/
07:05  benkulbertis: ok, I'm sorry but I'm still confused. What is wrong with my code here? http://jsfiddle.net/nfrek/ Apparently something is wrong with my AJAX logic.
07:05  carbonhat: danheberden - I have one "Universal Font Control" set, then 26 different "Font Option Sets". All the ones where that checkbox is checked, should change to match the "Universal" setting. All the ones unchecked should not
07:05  destinydriven: RichardE: if you want to get individual shapes to work independently, you will have to assign ids to them and use  the ids as selectors
07:06  carbonhat: danheberden - it all works swimmingly on its own (without the checkbox stuff) - it's just "if next checkbox is checked" that's stumping me
07:07  RichardE: destinydriven -- I looked a classmate's code and she put, where I have $("div.shapeinfo").show(); she put $("div.shapeinfo", this).show();
07:07  carbonhat: to top it all off, this code has been handed off to me - i didn't write the original, i was just tasked with "add the checkbox thing"
07:07  RichardE: and hwen I add the ", this" it works
07:07  RichardE: ????
07:09  danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/UAqXK/4/
07:09  benkulbertis: Anybody have any idea what is wrong with my ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/nfrek/
07:09  danheberden: there's more class names you're referencing 'n shit so i have no idea what you're doing
07:09  destinydriven:  $("div.shapeinfo", this).show();  you can try something like  $('div#circle').show()
07:10  danheberden: but hopefuly thats a starting poing
07:10  danheberden: carbonhat - you should really re-think the architechture of what you're trying to achieve
