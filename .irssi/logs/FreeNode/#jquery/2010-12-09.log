00:00  croby: is there an easy way to, given a child element, find out which order that child is in relative to the parent? so if I had a ul > li, find out which position that li is in in relation to the other li's in the ul? I know I could do it by iterating over children, but that doesn't seem very cool
00:00  buddyq: croby, thats what i was trying to ask earlier.
00:01  buddyq: thats what I meant by "index"
00:01  buddyq: li[2], etc.
00:02  yacc: Wondering, any idea what could make .tabs(options) calls get ignored? And how can I try to figure it out?
00:04 @bot-t: yacc, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
00:04  yacc: Yeah, I guess I'm down to trying to find a minimal non-working example :(

00:11  smcguinness: looking to mimic the functionality of http://www.linkedin.com/ search drop down
00:12  smcguinness: except for a hover event
00:12  smcguinness: the hover is fine, however, when I leave the hover element to the drop down, i cant get it to stay
00:12  smcguinness: thoughts or suggestions?
00:13  BinaryKitten: smcguinness $('targetSelector').hover(function(){ $('#popupdivID').show(); }, function() { $('#popupdivID').hide(); });
00:14  BinaryKitten: you'll need to work out how to get it to not hide when you move over the panel though.. not going to give you all the answers :p
00:14  smcguinness: BinaryKitten: haha, that is the answer i'm looking for though
00:14  buddyq: how do I jqueryify a dom element?
00:14  smcguinness: BinaryKitten: already have the hover event firing
00:14  BinaryKitten: buddyq pass it to jquery
00:15  buddyq: BinaryKitten, like this? I have elem = [HTMLLiElement] so doing $(elem) will do it?
00:15  BinaryKitten: yep
00:15  smcguinness: BinaryKitten: I've messed with trying to detect the event.target, setting a variable, etc
00:15  buddyq: BinaryKitten, its an <li> and I need to find which one it is in the order.
00:16  buddyq: how do I do that?
00:16  BinaryKitten: buddyq .. ok? and what's not working
00:16  buddyq: i dont know how to get the order...
00:16  BinaryKitten: ?index
00:16 @bot-t: .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
00:16  buddyq: if the <li> is the 3rd <li> I want to get 3 to pass to another function.

00:21  BinaryKitten: and reset it again when you leave it

01:21  CFNinja: Hmm.
01:21  RTPMatt: better open up firebug
01:24  CFNinja: been there. I'm trying the code on a different server.
01:24  RTPMatt: well, i don't know, the code looks fine to me
01:29  CFNinja: Ugh. Code validates. No js errors. This is mad http://cfninja.com/pub/test/OrderDetails.cfm

01:33  heauxbag: CFNinja: i'm talking about removing all of the options and replacing them with new ones
01:33  heauxbag: i figure .html?
01:33  CFNinja: oh.
01:35  CFNinja: I'm not clear on your circumstance. Seems like I'd start with $("#idoftheselect option").remove(); then build the new options.

01:40  dev2: I just wondered if there some reason it wouldn't behave the same as an actual click (security concerns, etc).  I'll keep trying
01:40  croby: it'll behave just fine
01:41  dev2: I trap the key stroke.  I trigger the click event on the link.  I have a click event on $("a")  just so I can see whats going on, and it is triggering.
01:41  dev2: but the page never goes to the link
01:42  DAElectric_: anyone have a good html5 tutorial?
01:43  croby: dev2 are you returning false by chance in your click event handler?

03:32  DAElectric_: hmmmm wonder how the html5 input type="url" is going to handle parsing none http:// or ftp:// urls    file://
03:32  Dracos: or aol://
03:38  luxgeek: I need to be able to trap a click on an <a href> link in jquery(which is working fine), then pass it to my php function to handle from there...without the browser trying to go to the link...is there anyway to post/get to my php function and NOT have it return to the jquery script?
03:38  luxgeek: I'm having to prevent default atm is there anyway to tell jquery to then UNprevent default after?
03:39 * luxgeek thinks that each time I come here that the ppl signed on are either sleeping or dead :P
03:43  RTPMatt: mostly dead
03:43  Dracos: I feel happy!
03:44  RTPMatt:  luxgeek: you need to use ajax, and the either do e.preventDefault() in your handler, or reutrn false; at the end of it
03:44  RTPMatt: happy?  whats that like?
03:44  Dracos: you don't want to go on the cart
03:45  luxgeek: RTPMatt: I did that...but the function I'm passing the link path off to then needs to go to that path...but it can't because prevendefault or return false prevents it. :/
03:45  RTPMatt: luxgeek: so, you don't want to go to that path, but you do?  I'm not following
03:46  Hello71: luxgeek: Can you just set window.location.href in the ajax callback?
03:46  luxgeek: RTPMatt: I'm guessing because it was a cliked link that was intercepted that it's the default behavior being prevented....
03:46  Hello71: s/can/can't
03:47  RTPMatt: perhaps Hello71 has your answer?  I'm still not sure what your problem is.
03:48  luxgeek: Hello71: Prob is...I am actually needing to send it to another internal php function to take the reformatted drupal link (changed from a path to a node Id) and displays it within the clients parameters for a mobile device.
03:49  RTPMatt:  luxgeek: you should be able to do that in php regardless of what the javascript does
03:49  luxgeek: and I don't think window.location.href will do that will it? I can try it I guess...it's all on a test server anyway atm :P
03:49  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Do what exactly?
03:50  RTPMatt: call another php function from inside your php.  That should have nothing to do with the javascript
03:50  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Hmmm...you may be right...if I use the Location: function...it may work...not sure.
03:50  luxgeek: RTPMatt: But atm I'm doing something similar to that but I'm still getting returned back to the jquery code...
03:51  luxgeek: at the end of my function I AM calling another function...but the e.preventdefault seems to be keeping me from getting there....

03:52  RTPMatt: ok then
03:52  RTPMatt: luxgeek: can you post code?
03:52  luxgeek: RTPMatt: This is how I get to the url reformat code:
03:52  luxgeek: var href = $(this).attr(\'href\');
03:52  luxgeek: 								$.get("m/nodealias", { path: href });
03:53  luxgeek: RTPMatt: And directly following that is: alert("I am still coming back to the script just after the get!!! GAH!!!");
03:53  luxgeek: RTPMatt: And I get there everytime.

03:55  cn1209: Is there any documentation for reverse ajax using jquery
03:55  Adman65: can you submit file data using serialize() / ajax?
03:56  Adman65: nm
03:56  RTPMatt: Adman65: you can't submit files with ajax
03:58  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Here you go: http://paste2.org/p/1132223   I put a comment for you in there in all caps so you wouldn't miss it :P
03:59 @bot-t: my philosofy is to let person like you run your on code in your brain.. once you understand it will be a red head to wash with dirty waters.. no problem enjoy
04:00  luxgeek: ^^ can't spell philosphy right tho :P
04:00  RTPMatt: luxgeek: hmm, im still not exatly sure what you problem is , but I'm guessing it is the ajax stuff.  You need to pass $.get a function.  that fuynction will be called after the $.get request ois finished, and you will have access to the returned results in it
04:00  DAElectric_: are you wanting to just not prevent the defualt the 2nd time they click on it?
04:00  RTPMatt: $.get does not wait for the request to finish (that is the point of ajax)
04:01  DAElectric_: if so just set a property on the link with an if statement at the start
04:01  luxgeek: RTP...but that's just it...I am not returning anything...
04:02  RTPMatt: luxgeek: then whats the problem?  what is happening that you think shouldn't (or the inverse)
04:02  RTPMatt: ?
04:02  luxgeek: DAElectric_: They are only clicking once...I reformat the link to actually point to an internal function that drupal knows what to do with...so I am just trying to get it to that second function...usually...I am able to build the links myself...
04:03  luxgeek: But these links are user created within the body of a post...so I have to trap the click and reformat and the intend is then to let drupal redirect etc...
04:03  RTPMatt: also, this: var href = $(this).attr(\'href\'); should just be var href = $(this).attr('href');
04:04  luxgeek: RTPMatt: What's NOT happening is...with preventdefault inplace...I get the reformatted link returned instead of redirected....without it...the user is direced to the original link as if it never went to my function at all.

04:05  DAElectric_: damn i cant type
04:05  luxgeek: RTPMatt: I know...but that's just the way drupal modules work...nothing I can do about it really :(
04:06  cn1209: has anyone played around with reverse AJAX. Example: Comet server or something in its realm?
04:06  RTPMatt: luxgeek: yeah, i think hello was on the right track.  How are you going to get the reformated URL if you say the .get does not return anything?
04:06  brendo^: Hey, does anyone know where I would start looking to figure out how to make OS X-Dock-like icon magnification for SVG icon-based navigation for web?
04:07  brendo^: preferably using jQuery?
04:07  luxgeek: RTPMatt: The REAL prob is...it would be a nightmare to parse the post bodies for all the links they may have and replace them with a proper one (not to store but just on output) so instead of doing that I just want to trap the click...reformat the link...and send them where they're SUPPOSED to go :)
04:08  alcuadrado: brendo^, maybe you can use Raphael
04:08  brendo^: alcuadrado: just googled it but cant find a main page for Raphael. What exactly is it?
04:08  RTPMatt: luxgeek: then what does the get do?  but either way, just set window.location = 'you new link'
04:08  luxgeek: RTPMatt: This: drupal_goto("m/singlenode/".$nid); will handle sending them to the right place, the right way...or at least the "drupal" way :P
04:08  alcuadrado: brendo^, http://raphaeljs.com/
04:09  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Can you see how the link will be reformatted on what I just pasted?
04:09  brendo^: odd that it didnt come up when i googled it.
04:09  brendo^: alcuadrado: thank you very much
04:09  alcuadrado: brendo^, you're wellcome
04:09  RTPMatt: eh, that is not really a valid link, so i am not sure how you would use it
04:09  luxgeek: RTPMatt: It would then look like: m/singlenode/3119  will window.location.href handle that as though the user clicked on it?
04:09  brendo^: alcuadrado: So Raphael has nothing to do with jQuery, then?
04:09  RTPMatt: you want <a href="drupal_goto("m/singlenode/".$nid);">blah</a> ?
04:10  RTPMatt: luxgeek: yeah, just do window.location = 'm/singlenode/3119'
04:10  alcuadrado: AFAIK not brendo^
04:10  brendo^: alcuadrado: Alright, great. Thanks for the start!
04:10  alcuadrado: as it's SVG/VML, not DOM
04:10  luxgeek: RTPMatt: No...the url is this:  m/singlenode/3119  <-- exactly as that. Drupal knows what to do if a user clicks on a link like that.
04:11  luxgeek: RTPMatt: So then...window.location behaves as though the user clicked on a link then?
04:11  RTPMatt: luxgeek: yup
04:11  luxgeek: Sweet.
04:11  luxgeek: Thx...will try it and report back.
04:11  luxgeek: :P
04:15  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Should I then take out the preventdefault or will the window.location not be affected by that?
04:15  RTPMatt: luxgeek: no, you should leave it in
04:15  luxgeek: RTPMatt: K, Thx.
04:16  RTPMatt: sure thing
04:17  Adman65: is there an easy way to serialize the form + some other data?
04:17  Adman65: like another array?
04:22  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Ok...it PARTLY worked,,,instead of acting like a user clicked it in just puts that as if the user pasted a url and hit enter...I need it to behave as if a user "clicked it on the page" behavior,,,ideas?  But we're SO close...so ...awesome!
04:23  RTPMatt: luxgeek: oh, suppose you need to append the beginning of the url?
04:24  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Well...no...see, if that WAS the url the user clicked on (the reformatted one) drupal would then pass it to my OTHER function which handles the formatting of the page...instead of letting drupal theme it...(long sorty so don't ask :P )
04:24  luxgeek: *story
04:25  RTPMatt: you probably want to do something like window.location.split(window.pathname)[0] + theUrlYouHaveRightNow
04:25  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Because it's defind in my module's menu_callback stuff...so drupal knows that's what needs to happen...if I append the other stuff at the beginning it would be no different than now.
04:26  brendo^: Can one import SVG art into a canvas element to be manipulated by jQuery? Correct me if i'm wrong, but I can't find anything in jQuery about manipulating SVG
04:26  brendo^: (forgive me, i'm probably asking the wrong questions. still trying to wrap my head around svg and canvas)
04:26  RTPMatt: er
04:26  RTPMatt: window.location.href.split(window.location.pathname)[0]
04:26  RTPMatt: + yourURL
04:27  luxgeek: RTPMatt: Gotcha...wil try it.
04:28  luxgeek: RTPMatt:  Now nothing happens...it just sits there on the same page you were on when you clicked :P
04:30  luxgeek: RTPMatt: I would have thought there would have been a way to do a click since we can trap for one :P   Must be thinking SO far outta the box that I ended up in a paralell universe :P
04:32  luxgeek: My only other otion would be to parse the whole post body BEFORE output and replace all the href values with what I need....and THAT doesn't sound like ANY fun at all! :(
04:32  luxgeek: *option
04:33  luxgeek: Unless there's a handy dandy way jquery could fly through it ....it IS all in ONE variable so...
04:34 * luxgeek thinks RTPMatt has given up :P
04:34  bartmax: hi all :D
04:35  bartmax: I have a question, and after that I will support for a little (got some time to spare) :) -- Question: how to secure ajax calls (request) on a full driven ajax site?
04:36  brendo^: alcuadrado: It occurs to me that I might be able to accomplish the same thing with CSS3... think I might be able to?
04:36  alcuadrado: yes, you can
04:37  alcuadrado: the quality of the animation would vary depending on the browser implementation
04:37  alcuadrado: for example, CSS3 transformations in firefox 3.6 suck
04:37  brendo^: alcuadrado: should be alright with FF/Chrome/Safari, you'd think though, right?
04:37  brendo^: oh bummer
04:37  alcuadrado: but in firefox 4, chrome and else they are pretty cool
04:37  brendo^: FF4 is still in alpha, isnt it?
04:38  crab: bartmax: what do you mean?
04:38  alcuadrado: it also depends on how much do you want to transform the images
04:38  brendo^: not very much. 128x128 down to 48x48, probably.
04:38  alcuadrado: it's actually in beta7, about to shipping the beta8
04:38  brendo^: alcuadrado: thats a lot further along than i thought. nonetheless, i need to, at the bare minimum, target stable releases atm
04:39  bartmax: crab: let's see, I have a server side method that mmm add user to database, and I need that method exposed to Javascript, but of course, it needs to be secure from executing it.
04:39  alcuadrado: brendo, just test it, and maybe the quality isn't bad
04:39  alcuadrado: also, you can replace the images with a highquality 128x128 once the animation finished
04:39  rpj8: Would using $.get('search.php') pass the same data to search.php that a regular <form action="search.phpmethod="get">
04:39  rpj8:  fffff
04:39  rpj8: one sec
04:40  Cvelde1: bartmax: no, you dont
04:40  alcuadrado: css3 animations trigger events on finished brendo^
04:40  bartmax: Cvelde1: what do u mean by : you dont ?
04:40  Cvelde1: bartmax: you dont need it exposed to javascript :)
04:40  rpj8: Would using $.get('search.php', { username: $('input [name="username"]').val() } ) pass the same data to search.php that a regular <form action="search.php" method="get">?
04:40  brendo^: alcuadrado: What are the implications of that?
04:41  alcuadrado: brendo^, you can replace the low quality transformed image with a highquality one :)
04:41  bartmax: ? $.get
04:41 @bot-t: bartmax, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
04:41  luxgeek: Guess RTPMatt has given up on me :P
04:41  rpj8: welp there we go.
04:41  bartmax: ? $.post
04:41 @bot-t: bartmax, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
04:41  brendo^: alcuadrado: interesting. so i'd replace the transformed image with jQuery, i take it?
04:41  Cvelde1: bartmax: but in the case you would need to (nonsense) there is no way you could protect it from executing
04:41  crab: bartmax: (a) check that the user is authenticated, of course and (b) protect against csrf attacks by sending a cookie with each form and verifying it in the handler (google for csrf, it'll explain how)
04:42  rpj8: ty bartmax
04:42  alcuadrado: yeah brendo^ =)
04:42  brendo^: alcuadrado: you're freaking solid, man.
04:42  crab: and validate the rest of the form parameters too, of course.
04:43  bartmax: crab: I've read that I need to add a while(1) so it can be cross-domain execution via <script> tag... I thought it would be some example of practical uses for securify on the matter.
04:43  bartmax: can = cant
04:43  crab: ...what?
04:44  alcuadrado: brendo^, transitionend is the event triggered
04:44  bartmax: crab: more info on that 'hack' here: http://insecureweb.com/javascript/secure-your-ajax-request-with-jquery/
04:45  alcuadrado: and webkitTransitionEnd in webkit
04:46  bartmax: xss attacks
04:46  bartmax: I dont understand how csrf works (i used it on Django [python]) but never understood it.
04:47  Cvelde1: o.O
04:47  crab: i don't understand this. is the server returning javascript code on a post request, or what?
04:47  rpj8: what's a decent plugin to look at html after jquery has done it's thang :P
04:47  rpj8: firefox plugin
04:47  rpj8: that is
04:48  ironmagma: rpj8: Web Developer
04:48  bartmax: crab the JSON returns while(1) as a parameter, so if you include the request on a <script> tag (which allows cross-domain) will loop.
04:48  ironmagma: rpj8: http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/
04:49  deafferret: w/in 22
04:49  Cvelde1: bartmax: where is the security?
04:49  Cvelde1: that makes no sense at all o.O
04:49  rpj8: thanks very much
04:50  dunkel2: hello hello
04:50  bartmax: check here: http://insecureweb.com/javascript/secure-your-ajax-request-with-jquery/ if you have xss vulnerabilities, any kind of token technique (like csrf) is a waste
04:50  Cvelde1: thats plain crap
04:51  dunkel2: guys, have you have a problem in IE that when u fadeIn a div containing a PNG there is a blabk border or something similar
04:52  bartmax: Cvelde1: is it? im have no knownlodge of js security...
05:04  bartmax: so quiet, i think my connection get lost :)
05:19  Aple: What is the quick way to call doc ready?
05:19  Aple: $(function){ or something?
05:19  Brodingo: $(function(){});
05:19  ironmagma: $(document).ready(function(){ blah })
05:23  Tordek: hi
05:25  Tordek: I'm trying to change a form's action as it's being submitted. ie: <type> <press enter> <change action> <send to new action url>, but if I try to return true in the .submit() handler, it just sends to the old action url
05:27  eppa: Tordek: preventDefault or something?
05:27  Aple: thanks brod
05:27  Tordek: eppa: sure, that stops it... but how do I make it submit afterwards?
05:28  Aple: Any cons to that method?
05:29  bartmax: Tordek: you can do from.submit()
05:29  bartmax: form.submit()
05:29  Tordek: bartmax: that just loops into itself :s
05:29  bartmax: BUT! have in mind that the button that triggers the form, if it have a name/value pair won't be sent in the submit
05:30  bartmax: Tordek: it doesn't.
05:30  coldhead: who wears short shorts?
05:30  Tordek: bartmax: uh, my live example begs to disagree
05:31  bartmax: $('#myForm').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault();$(this).submit();}) <-- try this
05:32  bartmax: Tordek: errrr,... i think it's $('mySubmitButton').submit() :)
05:36  Tordek: bartmax: no dice; still getting a loop...
05:36  BriMestone_: other than <div id="*".. what else can i use to trigger a function?
05:37  bartmax: Tordek: $('[type="submit"]').submit(function(e){e.preventDefault();$('form').submit();}) <-- this MUST work.
05:37  bartmax: BriMestone_: ?????
05:38  BriMestone_: can i use <a href="void" id="function"> ??
05:38  bartmax: BriMestone_: why would you do that?
05:38  BriMestone_: well aside from using buttons..
05:39  bartmax: BriMestone_: you can add click event to any element... a is not needed.
05:39  BriMestone_: alternative for me lame <button id="seek">Current +50</button>
05:39  bartmax: BriMestone_: but, you can use <a>
05:40  bartmax: like this: <a href="a-real-link.html">Something</a> and then on your script $('a').click(function() {}); wrapped in a doc.ready()
05:41  bartmax: obviuslly you can target a specific link via id or class
05:41  BriMestone_: but that function is going to get called by any <a> tag...
05:41  BriMestone_: i have something like <button id="stop">Stop</button> but id prefer not to use button..
05:42  hahuang65: hey guys, can I pinpoint an element in jquery by doing ID and class? for example if I wanted to find the class of "button" that is contained by a div whose id is "contact" but i do this: $("#Contact .button").removeClass("someClass")
05:42  bartmax: BriMestone_: <a href="no_js_alternative.html" id="stop">Stop</a>
05:42  bartmax: BriMestone_: $('#stop').click(function() {//do something})
05:42  BriMestone_: thanks
05:43  bartmax: BriMestone_: oh, you may want to prevent default
05:43  bartmax: BriMestone_: code should looks like : $('#stop').click(function(e) {e.preventDefault();//do something})
05:43  hahuang65: heh, I tried it. Works :)
05:43  bartmax: so link is not followed
05:44  bartmax: hahuang65: yes you can :)
05:44  hahuang65: bartmax: :-p thanks, I got it :D TIAS ftw :-)
05:44  BriMestone_: i got.. <a id="function">xxx</a> i just did not realize that i can do that..
05:45  BriMestone_: <a id="show" style="cursor: pointer;">[Marks]</a>
05:45  BriMestone_: :D
05:45  luxgeek: Frustrating...I'm appending a full <a> tag/link and trying to do a .trigger('click") on it and nothing happens. Can you do that on an element even if it isn't visible? (e.g. jqtouch default hides it)
05:45  bartmax: BriMestone_: it's would be better to make the login for everylink/button...
05:46  bartmax: luxgeek: does your a has an href ? :)
05:46  bartmax: luxgeek: are you using live for event handlers?
05:46  BriMestone_: nope.. it just an object to call my jQuery function
05:47  bartmax: BriMestone_: what i meant was: <a href="..." data-execute="functionName">command</a>
05:47  luxgeek: bartmax: Oooh...SO tempting to make a smart remark...resisting...yes it does...
05:47  luxgeek: :P
05:48  luxgeek: bartmax: Or even MORE tempting to say "Here's you're sign!" but since I don't know you and need/want help I will refrain :P
05:48  bartmax: and then wrap in a $([data-execute].click(function(e){if ($(this).attr('data-execute'){e.preventDefault;$(this).attr('data-execute')();})
05:48  bartmax: luxgeek: and you want to execute it's href? or some event added on js ?
05:48  luxgeek: bartmax: Yes I want to execute it's href.
05:49  jcody: Does anyone have experience with Pete Higgins' pubsub plugin? Specifically, I'm having some issues with it too-eagerly responses.
05:49  bartmax: BriMestone_: so every item with data-execute will try to call that function instead of doing it's default, no matter what it does.
05:49  bartmax: luxgeek: tryed $('#myLink').click(); ?
05:49  BriMestone_: man.. this jQuery amazes me.... only shows i havnt been in webdev for more than a decade
05:50  bartmax: ? jsfiddle

Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres

05:50  bartmax: luxgeek: can you post it on jsfiddle ?
05:50  luxgeek: bartmax: Sorry, I have to build the ele id prior.
05:50  luxgeek: bartmax: can try.
05:51  bartmax: you can always test with console.log ($(selector).attr('href')) to see if you are reaching the correct element

05:57  coldhead: oh it does? thanks
05:57  ajpiano: boom jquery ui has position method
05:58  jcody: Using pete higgin's pubsub plugin, I'm subscribing to an AJAX response generated when clicking an item. First time is great, but each subsequent time, I'm receiving an extra publish. Confirmed only publishing one item per call. Responses look like this: http://d.pr/pQJd

06:05  JRGould: Hey all - I asked this earlier today - but maybe there's someone here now that can help -> I'm working on a little app that will allow users to build a document ( for printing )that is a subset of all articles on a website, and I've created a little drag/drop interface to do so - since it wouldn't make sense to have the same article show up twice in the document I'd like the target (sortable) to reject a draggable from being dragged
06:05  JRGould: it if it already exists in the target. I've managed to do this by checking on the sortable's update event if there are more than one of the source element and if so to just remove it - but I'd really like to be able to have the sortable 'reject' the element so that draggable's 'revert' functionality is used (a neat little animation) - here is the src: http://jsfiddle.net/JRGould/5ehDf/ ant help with this or code crits of the whole w
06:05  JRGould: would be greatly appreciated
06:05  ajpiano: too simplifieid deos not dupe issue sorr bro
06:06  JRGould: furthermore: ajpiano wtf happened to yayquery - what am I supposed to listen to while I walk my dog now? jquery podcast? pff.
06:06  ajpiano: lol
06:06  ajpiano: we stil are making the podcast
06:06  ajpiano: just

06:07  JRGould: i was going to dress her up as a rainbow unicorn for next halloween in honor of yq
06:07  bartmax: ajpiano: is there anyway to secure ajax calls ?
06:07  JRGould: unicorn. rainbow. puppy. think about it.
06:07  ajpiano: bartmax: #1 ) don't ask a drunk guy
06:08  bartmax: ajpiano: #2) stop drinking yourself :)
06:08  ajpiano: #3) why
06:08  JRGould: #4) how can he drink himself, that sounds gross...
06:09  bartmax: ajpiano: i was thinking on doing a webapp, and the server only has methods that I want to expose/access via javascript (ajax) ... some methods will be 'sensitive' for hacking, so I think it can be done ONLY if we have a way to protect those ajax calls
06:09  bartmax: JRGould: sorry bout my enlgish, native is spanish.. i didn't mean that :)
06:09  ajpiano: bartmax, put some soldires near it and arm them with guns
06:09  ajpiano: they will secur the ajax
06:09  ajpiano: :/
06:10  JRGould: I kid, bartmax!
06:10  bartmax: ajpiano: i heard rumors of some wikileakers killing soldiers with zombies... soldiers are not reliable anymore. :D
06:11 --- ugisozols_away is now known as ugisozols
06:11  bartmax: and while zombies are great for attack, they are not for defense, so my second guess of using zombies instead of soldiers it's also not an option :(

06:17  FrozenFire: Is this the correct way to filter child input elements of a form based on the name attribute value?: $(".theForm").children("input[name=\"inputName\"]")
06:18  khurram: that link doesn't work
06:18  ajpiano: khurram: i hope you realised i literally jsut didd a google search
06:18  alcuadrado: it should work FrozenFire, but why not  $(".theForm input[name=\"inputName\"]") ?
06:18  FrozenFire: alcuadrado: Doing it in an each(), so I'm using $(this)
06:19  JRGould: wouldn't children() be faster anyhow?
06:19  khurram: yep no worries i googled a lot and then i came to this channel thinking may b i get some genuine
06:19  alcuadrado: FrozenFire,  $(".theForm input[name=\"inputName\"]").each(function () { console.log(this); });
06:19  khurram: by the way does any one know .chm manual for javascript ?
06:19  alcuadrado: JRGould, who cares? :P
06:20  FrozenFire: alcuadrado: Believe me, I'm structuring it correctly ;). No use explaining the whole context.
06:20  alcuadrado: it'd be preoptimization
06:20  JRGould: hah - milliseconds matter alcuadrado
06:20  JRGould: @
06:20  alcuadrado: I disagree
06:21  alcuadrado: miliseconds matter, sometimes
06:21  ss23: Well deepends what browser right?
06:22  BriMestone_: how hard is to SELECT  from mysql via jQuery??
06:22  dilvie: I missed the topic.
06:22  JRGould: I like the idea that I might be one day making applications where milliseconds matter and therefore do my best to know the most efficient ways to do things (@alcuadrado )
06:22  alcuadrado: brimestone, it's not possible :s
06:22  BriMestone_: Ajax??
06:22  JRGould: brimestone: very!
06:22  dilvie: Bri: you don't. jQuery doesn't have any mySQL helpers.
06:23  dilvie: BriMestone: You can use j
06:23  alcuadrado: brimestone, make an ajax call is trivial, but you should implement the server side app to respond to that call =)
06:23  BriMestone_: sorry.. i just woke from the blinding php mysql isolation
06:23  dilvie: jQuery to access a mySQL database via a server-side json service.
06:24  alcuadrado: JRGould, it's pretty cool to know that. But I always prefer clean code =) as the good old donald says: http://bit.ly/PREMATURE
06:24  JRGould: brimestone: you need to perform your database transactions with php - though you could create a simple api for accessing your db from jq
06:24  ss23: Awesome image alcuadrado XD
06:24  alcuadrado: =)
06:25  dilvie: alcuadrado: What are you calling premature optimization?
06:25  JRGould: alcuadrado:  hah!
06:25  BriMestone_: so.. i create a server side php select query which feeds my jQ?
06:25 --- BlueSherpa_ is now known as BlueSherpa
06:25  alcuadrado: optimize before knowing that something IS performance critical
06:25  JRGould: maybe i just think too much like a computer - I always read selectors from right to left, so I still prefer find(), children(), etc.
06:25  BriMestone_: and in return fetchning data without refresing the page :D
06:25  dilvie: BriMestone: That topic is outside the scope of this channel. Try #php
06:26  BriMestone_: thanks
06:26  jcody: oh, ajpiano, re: earlier pubsub issue. troubleshooting away, but didn't think that i could simply link to the broken code on a dev server: http://app.dev.optini.com/ftg-rebuild/fandangoMain.php
06:26  jcody: repro: click theater name, click movie name.
06:26  jcody: definitely no problem if you can't have a look at it. wish i could simplify to a fiddle :/
06:26 * ss23 fiddles jcody 
06:27  dilvie: BriMestone: And be sure to ask, "How do I create a json web service to fetch data from a mySQL database for ajax calls?" -- or something along those lines.
06:27  JRGould: brimestone: yeah you can create a script that accepts FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, etc. args that you can pass via POST and return via JSON or something - just be aware of the security implications
06:27  BriMestone_: thanks dilvie was just thinking about how to ask that
06:27  alcuadrado: hey guys, what's the meaning of fiddle? :$ I  couldn't find a definition on the web that had something in common with jsFiddle
06:27  jcody: it means, "to mess with" or "to tinker with" or "to play with"
06:27  l4rk: alcuadrado: to fuck with
06:27  dilvie: alcuadrado: Ignoring best practices for efficient code is the root of all evil.
06:28  alcuadrado: thanks =)
06:28  JRGould: it's an instrument much like a violin
06:28  jcody: one might fiddle with their car when trying to fix it. or fiddle with their keys looking for the right one to put in the door.
06:28  alcuadrado: dilvie, yeah, that's knuths point in that quote
06:28  JRGould: so like... jsFiddle - is... a stringed instrument... for th e web
06:28  JRGould: or something...
06:28  BriMestone_: anybody heard about SAJAX?
06:29  alcuadrado: IMHO, it's a piece of shit :)
06:29  alcuadrado: and I'm a php developer too
06:29  BriMestone_: no good??
06:29  alcuadrado: I haven't tryed it, but I don't like the idea of autogenerating javascript
06:30  alcuadrado: I don't wanna think about having to debug autogenerated js in ie6
06:30  dilvie: somebody on IRC went on a rant when I suggested they use string functions to format numbers instead of math functions -- I suggested it because string functions are faster, and the source data was already a string. They called it "preoptimization" and informed me that it's the root of all evil.
06:30  dilvie: I laughed at them.
06:32  ss23: wtf
06:32  ss23: That's messed up dilvie
06:32  dilvie: auto-generating javascript = probably a bad idea.
06:32  ss23: What does "preoptimization" even mean?
06:32  ss23: Like, before optimization?
06:32  ss23: Isn't that just coding?
06:32  l4rk: dilvie: isn't that what gwt does?
06:32  l4rk: ss23: no its harping on stupid shit
06:32  dilvie: ss23: generally, it means doing things like unrolling loops when you don't need to.
06:32  l4rk: that doesn't mean anything
06:32  iszak: it's optimization before you really need to optimize.
06:32  BriMestone_: so i need to do json
06:32  ss23: :<
06:32  ss23: I was making a funny
06:33  ss23: I mean that I've only ever seen it as Premature Optimization, and preoptimization would imply before optimization
06:33  ss23: But FINE
06:33 * ss23 sobs
06:33  l4rk: your joke was premature
06:33  ss23: I'm premature around your mother
06:33  dilvie: preoptimization is bad when you take it to the point that you damage readability for the sake of shaving milliseconds off of something that isn't a bottleneck.
06:34  ss23: Yeah, I know what it is >.<
06:34  JRGould: i thought premature optimization was normal? that's what my last girlfriend told me...
06:34  ss23: I've just never heard the specific term "preoptimization"
06:35  dilvie: but following best practices to make your application fast (stuff like caching your jquery selector lookups, or pulling crap out of a loop that doesn't belong there in the first place) does not qualify as preoptimization.... it's just smart coding.
06:35  l4rk: JRGould: she was being... nice?
06:35  l4rk: or hot
06:35  JRGould: she said as long as my code wasn't minified it was cool
06:36  JRGould: there's a closure joke in here somewhere too... I just know it
06:36  JRGould: self invoking anonymous function.
06:37  dilvie: there's no such thing as a self invoking anonymous function in strict mode.
06:37  dilvie: immediately invoking functions still work, however. ;)
06:38 --- okaycool_ is now known as okaycool
06:38  alcuadrado: you must name them in strict
06:38  JRGould: you nerds ruined it.
06:38  alcuadrado: afaik that's to let compiler optimize them
06:39 --- seutje is now known as frigginWork
06:39  alcuadrado: that's why arguments.caller was removed too
06:39  dilvie: alcuadrado: You don't have to name IIFs in strict mode. I was just making fun of the "self invoking" misnomer.
06:40  JRGould: callee
06:40  dilvie: alcuadrado: and taking advantage of the opportunity to toss the kinky "strict" reference into the sexual innuendo cesspool that JR was stirring up.
06:40  alcuadrado: only if you what the function to be recrusive I meant
06:41  alcuadrado: I didn't get the joke, sorry :$

07:22 +andr0id: the fare, stay and food and fun*
07:23  rethus: i try to make a little faq-script. The questions should be visible. if someone click on a question, the answer should slide below it to visible.
07:23 @paul_irish: hey rethus
07:23 +andr0id: that's simple rethus :P
07:23 @paul_irish:  wait  you're not my friend nevermind
07:23  rethus: so i try all the questions encapsulate in divs... id=f1, id=f2 and so on
07:24  rethus: the answers i encapsulate into divs with id like id="a1" id=a2" and so on.
07:24  alcuadrado: you can use classes rethus
07:24 +andr0id: why use ids? use classes
07:24  alcuadrado: that would be cleaner
07:24 +andr0id: and then it would be 1-2 lines of code in the jquery :P
07:25  rethus: ok, can u explain this?
07:25  crab: rethus: just give the questions class=question and the answers class=answer and in the click handler find the answer by using .next('div.answer')
07:25  rethus: how can i differ which question is clicked, if i don'Ät have a unique id?
07:25 +andr0id: $('.x').click(function(){ $('.x').next('.y').slideDown(); }); ? :P
07:25  dilvie: rethus: that's what the .next call is for.
07:25  crab: rethus: $('.question').click(function () { $(this).next('.answer').show() } );
07:25  rethus: ah, ok, realy clean... much better than divs. thanks
07:26  rethus: i'll try this
07:26  crab: or yeah, slideDown. whatever.
07:26 +andr0id: wow, slideDown is a jquery function ? :P
07:26  shashidhar: how to highlight contents of all the elements which have same class name
07:26 +andr0id: $('.x').getMeHighlighted();
07:28  dilvie: slideDown can cause document reflow weirdness, FYI
07:29 +andr0id: dilvie: how do you fix that ?
07:29  dilvie: I yanked it out of a countdown timer we were using because it made the layout dance up and down in funny ways.

07:29 +andr0id: not screen but the body portion in the html

07:30  dilvie: <-- lazy
07:30 * andr0id is lazy too, and was lazy enough to not even pull out the anim
07:30  crab: i've never used any of the animation functions
07:30  dilvie: andr0id: Yeah, it's probably because the browser is doing a reflow / repaint cycle. );
07:31 +andr0id: invent some more terms for that characteristics :P
07:31  dilvie: andr0id: you could plan the container size appropriately, or hide the container overflow...
07:31 +andr0id: that would be lame, anyway, I already mentioned I am lazy and don't bother

08:52  ernop: anybody use labjs?  i'm using it to load some scripts, the first one of which is jquery.  the later ones depend on jquery... and who woulda thunk it, but it works in chrome and ff, but for some reason ie8 doesn't realize it's already loaded jquery by the time it gets to the first one that requires it, and just dies!
08:54  alcuadrado: are you using wait() ernop ?
08:54  rethus: why it didn't work, if i encapsulate the div calss="answer" int div class="question"... and using slideToggle() ? http://www.erfolgsbeginn.de/basis/front_content.php?idcat=7
08:54  ernop: alcuadrado, yes, I am
08:54  alcuadrado: so, no idea what could be happening
08:54  rethus: have i to choose something like child() instead of next() ?
08:56  rethus: or better here: http://jsfiddle.net/FVKCx/1/
08:57  rethus: k, found the function children() with it, it works... i will buy me a jquery-book and learn to handle this framework... its realy great and easy to use.
08:58  ernop: I'm doing pretty much $LAB.script("/media/js2/jquery-1.4.4.min.js").wait().script("/media/js2/mine.js").wait() but when i get to mine.js, it just fails to parse and nothing in there ends up getting defined.
08:58  alcuadrado: great rethus, you'll love it
08:58  rethus: i do it right now ;)
08:59  alcuadrado: I havent use LAB very much ernop, so I can't help you
09:00  ernop: i think it's likely an ie8 issue, not LAB...
09:02  alcuadrado: the new twitter uses LAB, and it works in ie8 AFAIK
09:04  ernop: maybe LAB has a better debug mode

09:59  johnny: why would someone see jQuery.queue  is not a function?
09:59  johnny: it's like jQuery isn't accessible inside jquery itself.. that makes no sense, so something else must be going on
10:01  JKarsrud: it's like you havent loaded it, or it's not a function on jquery itself?
10:02  johnny: well it seems to happen with the cycle plugin only, and only with jquery > 1.2.6
10:02  johnny: but.. i downloaded the cycle example code and tested it to make sure that it worked with 1.4.4
10:12  rethus: i use slideToggle to open and close a answerbox below my question.
10:12  rethus: what can i do to close the prev. open answer, if i click to another question.
10:13  Wyrmskull: looks like inserted elements cannot have css properties modified, why?
10:14  markj: Wyrmskull are you sure you're selecting the new elements correctly?

10:15  rethus: k, i got it
10:16  anli_: Is there autocomplete with checkboxes?
10:17  Wyrmskull: markj:  yeah, because text() works
10:17  markj: ah right
10:17  markj: i see no reason why you can't edit their css properties

10:26  ramontayag: I'm using this http://code.google.com/p/jquery-swapimage/ and it's cool, except I can't find a way to simply swap an image manually.. like $('img').swapThis('/some/other/image.gif'); Is there another plugin that does this?
10:34  JKarsrud: ramontayag: Do you really need a plugin to do that?
10:34  ramontayag: JKarsrud: no. but the less code i write, the better. :)
10:34  JKarsrud: You could make your own without much hassle
10:34  ramontayag: JKarsrud: yup found something like that here http://www.web-design-talk.co.uk/200/jquery-hover-effect-image-gallery-for-ecommerce/
10:34  JKarsrud: ramontayag: $('someimg').attr('src', '/some/other/image.gif');
10:35  JKarsrud: Do you want to swap on hover?
10:35  ramontayag: JKarsrud: nope, on some other event.
10:36  ramontayag: i want the thumbnail of the image i'm currently viewing to be colored (it's normally b&w).
10:36  ramontayag: but yes, what you pasted should be enough.
10:36  JKarsrud: aha
10:37  ramontayag: JKarsrud: i've implemented the rollover/rollout with swapimage.
10:37  ramontayag: but there are next and previous buttons (so you don't have to click on the thumbnails themselves). these already load the large image, but i want a visual clue to show that a particular thumbnail is currently being viewed. i wanted to make it colored.
10:41  JKarsrud: Aha. I guess you'll have to make som stuff yourself, then
10:41  JKarsrud: Doesn't look like the plugin have any options for that
10:44  ramontayag: JKarsrud: yup
10:46  Wyrmskull: If i was able to reproduce the error, I probably wouldn't have the problem at all
10:46  White--: hi, is there some built-in support to access input elements named in an "array" way like name="element[5]" (i know it's not valid html though)
10:47  Phil: that'd work fine ^^
10:47  markj: Wyrmskull if you don't show any code, I doubt anyone will be able to help, you should be able to modify the css properties
10:47  Wyrmskull: ive shown some code
10:48  markj: obviously I missed it then, hang on
10:48  Wyrmskull: but its not "working" as I cant call the cgi and the source file then
10:48  Wyrmskull: (9.59.49) Wyrmskull: http://jsfiddle.net/JVUSV/
10:48  JKarsrud: Wyrmskull: do a dump of the json that is returned then, and show us some other code
10:48  markj: i wasnt in the channel at that point
10:48  Wyrmskull: markj: np about that
10:48  JKarsrud: And why aren't you using $.getJSON?
10:48  JKarsrud: :)
10:49  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud: the answer is implicit
10:49  boobo: Hello you guys. Anyone know anything about touch events?
10:49  boobo: plugins etc
10:49  JKarsrud: Wyrmskull: If you make a proper example at jsfiddle, with the json returned from the server stored in a string, and some markup, it'd be a lot easier
10:50  boobo: Like the one apple is using on their iPad-site... a 360-viewer that works on touch
10:51  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud: I cant do much more... hufff it will take me more time to do that than anything else
10:51  ramontayag: JKarsrud: another question. given class="swapImage {src: 'images/2.gif'}", how do I extract "src" manually? Looked at swapImage source but can't figure it out
10:51  thrillERboy: how to run a function automatically on page load?
10:51  Wyrmskull: i have to fake a file load and dom inserting the results
10:51  Wyrmskull: i think that if i do that, i lose the point of my error
10:51  dominikl: hi guys, does anyone know if and when the currently experimental scrollview will become part of a jquery mobile release? maybe with alpha3?
10:51  ruby_on_tails: how can i toggle slideup/down ?
10:51  JKarsrud: ramontayag: does swapImage to that?
10:51  ruby_on_tails: i knew how to do it but just cant remember :(
10:52  JKarsrud: ruby_on_tails: see ?slideToggle
10:52 @bot-t: ruby_on_tails, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
10:52  boobo: Wyrmskull: I actually made something like that tonight
10:52  ruby_on_tails: aah yes
10:52  ruby_on_tails: thanbks
10:52  ramontayag: JKarsrud: i suppose so - see #3 at http://code.google.com/p/jquery-swapimage/
10:52  boobo: last night
10:53  JKarsrud: ahh
10:53  Wyrmskull: boobo: good to know :P
10:53  boobo: http://interwebz.org/boat/ ....steal the code.. or make it better than give it back to me :D
10:54  JKarsrud: ramontayag: It uses the metadata-plugin
10:54  ramontayag: ahh
10:54  crab: http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/01/advanced-web-attack-techniques-using.html <- now that i understand this, it worries me
10:54  ramontayag: ok will study that then
10:54  JKarsrud: var data = $(this).metadata();
10:55  boobo: line 81 to 126 does all that stuff... if that was what you ment..
10:55  JKarsrud: That's the one
10:55  ss23: crab: I know that feeling. You learn about an attack, and all the code you've ever written flashes before your eyes like "oh god...."
10:55  JKarsrud: ramontayag: Then it uses the data.src to get the source
10:55  ramontayag: cool thanks JKarsrud
10:56  JKarsrud: And seeing as it requires metadata, you already have it included, thus you can to the same :)
10:56  Wyrmskull: this has no sense... i'm making a static demo of a dynamic content loading
10:57  Wyrmskull: and the problem is in the dynamic part
10:57  boobo: anyone know of a site where the entire plot is a man walking down some street? The link was pasted here some days ago
10:57  JKarsrud: How do you know? Can't it be the same without a dynamic part?
10:57  JKarsrud: boobo: http://benthebodyguard.com
10:57  boobo: thats the one. thanks
10:58  JKarsrud: np =)
10:58  boobo: not sure what you mean by static demo of dynamic content..hmz

10:59  Wyrmskull: i want to load content from a file and to be able to set his visibility through a menu button... they tell me to build a live demo in a different setting... and i cant cause i cant host the file and have it loaded in jsfiddle
10:59  schweizer: JKarsrud: is this possible with css=
10:59  schweizer: ?
10:59  schweizer: i thought ckEditor was customized by js
10:59  JKarsrud: Do mean that the user should actually be able to edit the line-height-property? Or is it just display?
10:59  schweizer: just display
11:00  JKarsrud: Wyrmskull: Then you need to provide some more info on what is wrong, because I didn't understand your problem at all
11:00  JKarsrud: schweizer: then you can inspect the ckEditor in the browser, and see which element is used, and set line-height on that?
11:01  schweizer: hm should it be that easy.....
11:01  JKarsrud: it should be

11:14  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud:  http://jsfiddle.net/JVUSV/25/ this is what should happen, but the <article> should be loaded from a file
11:15  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud: and the buttons should be one for each <div> inside the article, dynamically generated
11:15  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud:  but when i try the toggle(), there is a "this[a].style is undefined" error
11:16  Figaroo: can I do $var = $("<div>new element</div>").click(function(){...}); ?
11:16  Figaroo: and $var will equal the new element with the event callback attacted?
11:17  Wyrmskull: JKarsrud: if it isnt clear, try look at the original page http://brackets.alwaysdata.net/
11:17  JKarsrud: Figaroo: You could do this: var $var = $('<div>', { text: "new element", click: function() {});
11:20  Figaroo: really, didn't know that.
11:22  Figaroo: what kind of properties go inside that second parameter?
11:23  JKarsrud: all kinds of properties
11:23  JKarsrud: text, html, value, event bindings, classes, id's whatever
11:24  JKarsrud: text and html are special, and uses .text() and .html()
11:26  Figaroo: so for class it's just class:'something'
11:26  Figaroo: what about attributes?
11:26  Figaroo: What about appending other elements?

12:49  krz: why does this fail in jquery 1.4.4 ?
12:49  krz: $('input[name='+media_type+'[attachment]]').clone().appendTo($('#update-media').parents('form').find('div:eq(0)').css('display','none'));
12:55  Bisu[Shield]: as opposed to using .mouseover() .mouseout() functions, is there a way to only use one function??
12:55  Bisu[Shield]: maybe focus()
12:55  Bisu[Shield]: dont know
12:56  krz: why does $('input[name=song[attachment]]').length  return 0?
12:57  krz: ive got <input type="file" name="song[attachment]" style="position: absolute; right: 0pt; margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt; font-size: 480px; font-family: sans-serif; cursor: pointer;">
12:57  krz: $('input[type=file]').length  returns 1
12:57  krz: is this a bug in 1.4.4!?
13:01  krz: anyone?
13:01  JKarsrud: Hmm, doesn't chrome do clear on elements with display: none;=
13:02  ablomen: krz, try escaping the inner []'s
13:02  krz: ablomen: how do you mean?
13:02  ablomen: so something like $('input[name=song\[attachment\]]')
13:02  krz: i just tested this with 1.2.2, it works. 1.4.4 doesnt
13:03  ablomen: hmm
13:03  krz: $('input[name=song\[attachment\]]').length still returns 0
13:04  erichynds: thats a regression in 1.4.4
13:04  krz: regression?
13:04  erichynds: and you escape with \\
13:04  erichynds: and you need to wrap that in quotes
13:05  erichynds: regression = something that once worked but is now broke
13:05  krz: erichynds: so is this normal or broken in 1.4.4?
13:05  krz: $("input[name=song\\[attachment\\]]").length still returns 0
13:06  erichynds: wrap the some part in quotes
13:06  erichynds: "song\\[ ... \\]"
13:06  erichynds: but it still won't work
13:06  erichynds: because it's a bug in 1.4.4
13:06  ablomen: $("input[name='name[a]']").length; << seems to work
13:06  erichynds: letme look..
13:07  krz: yea $("input[name='song[attachment]']").length seems to work
13:07  pallet: I've got a <div id="notice">THIS IS A WARNING</div> which is hidden, then I'm using jQuery("#notice").fadeIn("fast"); to show it, but what if I've got a different text that needs to go in that id, at the moment, I'm creating a while new style id for a different notice
13:07  krz: but is this the right way to do this in 1.4.4 or is this a workaround?
13:07  pallet: I know I asked earlier and someone helped me, but my IRC client crashed and I've forgotten the answer
13:08  ernop: ok, if anybody remembers the ie8 labjs error from about 6 hours ago...  the answer is, if you have .script(src).wait().wait(function{})...  the first .wait() will wait forever and the function will end up running without the script being loaded.  yes it makes no sense...
13:08  krz: erichynds: is this a confirmed bug?
13:08  erichynds: 1 secd
13:08  erichynds: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7216
13:09  erichynds: ah, it's broke with the = char, not [ ]
13:10  serAphim: hi there. i'm trying to display a div dependent on a checkbox. when i use if($("#checkbox").not(":checked")) { $("#div").css("display","none"); } it hides the div when the box is checked and the page is reloaded. using if($("#checkbox").is(":checked")) { } else { $("#div").css("display","none"); } does the job, but i'm not really comfortable with that solution. any ideas?
13:12  krz: erichynds: so is $("input[name='song[attachment]']").length a workaround or the proper way?
13:13  erichynds: proper
13:13  krz: what was wrong with $("input[name=song[attachment]]").length ?
13:14  erichynds: you needed quotes
13:14  erichynds: to take the song part literally
13:14  erichynds: off to work
13:15  krz: ok thanks for clearing that up
13:15  glontu: any ideea how i can strip the wrapping div around some html that i receive from ajax ?

13:34  gremmachook: um there is something that I have in mind. I wanted to make a web app where we could dynamically take sections of text and join them together from a set of predefined text segments. I figured out that this could be done using JQuery ( I mean the interface ). I wanted to know if there is a way that I can have a temporary text file where the user drags and deletes text. This has to be done on a server. I am using PHP. When I say interface,
13:34  gremmachook: I mean the drag-and-drop interface.
13:36  Holek: on drop event do ajax call to save the contents, maybe?
13:37  gremmachook: Holek, thanks, how do I compile all the text together?

13:43  erichynds: attr("checked","checked")
13:45  Thorn: erichynds: attr of what? is it possible to select a radio button by value?
13:45  doonie: yes
13:45  doonie: instead of name use value
13:45  erichynds: select however you want
13:45  Thorn: can I use both at the same time?
13:45  erichynds: attr doesn't care as long as there's at least 1 elem found
13:46  Thorn: my problem is in selecting the correct one rather than setting its checked attribute
13:46  Holek: gremmachook: well, I assume they're <span> elements or sth, so I guess var text;$('#text span').each(function (i,e){text = text + $(e).text;}) should suffice ;)
13:47  Cork: erichynds: it doesn't care about that either actually, it will fail gracefully if there isn't one

13:47  Cork: same as <>

14:28  Wyrmskull: can two $.getJSON be nested?
14:28  Lumpio-: Define "nested"
14:28  gjvc: wyrmskull, yup
14:29  gjvc: lumpio-, call one within the callback of another
14:29  Lumpio-: k
14:29  Lumpio-: It's not really nested in an execution kinda sense though
14:29  coachz: i also tried width: 300  without quotes but my dialog width doesn't change
14:29  coachz:  https://gist.github.com/734705
14:30  gjvc: lumpio-, pointless conversation, but yes it is because the inner one will return before the outer one
14:32  Wyrmskull: ok the problem was that the parser is strict with quoted keys
14:32  Wyrmskull: the json was invalid and the callback couldnt be called

14:57  markj: oh yeah, that problem, I know the one
14:58  markj: ... but seriously, what problem, you're being pretty vague
14:59  rseyferth: everything works fine, but the event.preventDefault() just doesn't prevent the default action
15:00  markj: does it error at all?
15:00  pallet: I've got a <div id="notice">THIS IS A WARNING</div> which is hidden, then I'm using jQuery("#notice").fadeIn("fast"); to show it, but what if I've got a different text that needs to go in that id, at the moment, I'm creating a while new style id for a different notice
15:00  rseyferth: no, no errors
15:01  markj: pallet do you mean you want to change the text inside the div?
15:01  pallet: yeh, I guess
15:01  ernop: wow, so ie8 just arbitrarily caches ajax requests.
15:01  markj: im afraid I don't have ie9 to test or id try and help
15:01  pallet: can I do jQuery('#co_name').text("dfgsfdg")
15:01  pallet: or something like
15:02  crab: pallet: sure.
15:02  markj: well, that would change the text in a div with id co_name, if thats what you wanted to do sure
15:02  RTPMatt: rseyferth: my guess it the problem is in your end.  I think somone would have noticed if preventDefault() didnt work in ie 9.   can you post code?
15:02  pallet: cool
15:02  crab: markj: whatever element had id co_name, not necessarily a div
15:03  Aedous: Hey guys, i got a really important question
15:03  crab: though, well, i guess you probably knew that
15:03  markj: yeah, i know that, i didnt mean to say div :]
15:03  Aedous: How do you wait for a $.post action to complete, before you check for validation
15:03  pallet: ok, I think this one is my last question for a bit, I need an if statement to see if this is empty jQuery('#contact_name').val()
15:03  Aedous: for example if you want to check if a query to sql was a success or failure ?
15:03  crab: Aedous: give it a callback function to run when it's completed
15:03  rseyferth: an example:
15:03  rseyferth: $(this).click (function(event) {  			event.preventDefault(); 			if ($(this).hasClass ("active")) { return; }  			 			showVideo (this); 			 		});

15:06  Aedous: even if im interacting with PHP ?
15:06  ernop: hmm, so ie8 has decided to cache my $.getJSON queries, but ff & chrome don't.  is there a way to make the call in jquery so ie8 will just do it?  I could append a random string to the end...  which is probably easier than getting into the internals of server-side caching system...
15:08  pallet: can someone help me with syntax for .... if (($.trim(jQuery('#contact_name').val()).length==0) OR ($.trim(jQuery('#co_name').val()).length==0)) { Do something};
15:09  pallet: I'm not sure what the OR should be?
15:09  crab: if (a || b) {do something}
15:09  pallet: ||
15:09  pallet: fair enough
15:09  markj: you dont need to check if it is 0 by the way, just check the length and use it like a boolean
15:10  pallet: oh ok
15:11  pallet: markj, what I'm trying to write is........   if jQuery('#co_name').val() is empty then do something

15:15  ernop: wow, ie8 sucks soooooo bad.
15:16  pallet: markj, I'm new to all this business, but could you just do if (!jQuery('#co_name').val()) {do something}
15:19  markj: i guess yeah, seems to work as expected, be careful with any spaces in the input though
15:19  Aedous: HELP ME PLEASE. this ajax code does exactly the same thing as the post code.
15:20  Aedous: All i want it to do, is wait until it finishes retreiving a variable from the php , whether true or false..
15:20  Aedous: And then use that to determine whether to let the user do something or not.
15:20  Aedous: Both calls, have the same output...
15:20  Aedous: Any links that you can point me to at all?
15:20  markj: your php isnt right then
15:21  Aedous: all my php is doing
15:21  Aedous: it returning true or false ?
15:21  Aedous: and because its asynchronous, it does the other calls, before it even registers the new variable for it to check.
15:21  markj: success: function (data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) { // do something with data, which is whatever youre making php respond with }
15:21  markj: check in the callback then
15:21  markj: like you were told
15:22  Aedous: im new to this, all i need is a link, that explains it properly then i can go from there..

15:39 @bot-t: RTPMatt, Is a Modal Confirm Box Using JQuery Possible? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/878710/is-a-modal-confirm-box-using-jquery-possible
15:40  smackapoo: I am looking for a content slider that can be populated with database entries using ajax. I found sudo slider but it only allows images or a whole file like .html file to be used with ajax...
15:41  smackapoo: Anyone know a content slider that can be used for my purposes?
15:42  bamccaig: smackapoo: Is there a reason you can't transform your data into compatible html?
15:42 * bamccaig has never used sudo slider before. Just reading the Web site makes it sound like it can take in any data, so long as it conforms to a few simple rules.
15:42  smackapoo: you mean convert the database entry into an html file and then importing that?
15:43  Hopsy: http://twitter.com/#!/Op_Payback/status/12869971424055296 :O
15:44  danheberden: as long as they don't go after rackspacecloud
15:44  smackapoo: Wouldnt that mean to convert all database entries on the fly when needed? Wouldnt that slow everyting down or is there a simple way to accomplish that?
15:44  bamccaig: smackapoo: It really depends on what the database data /is/, I guess... And what you're trying to achieve with it.
15:44 --- kurund_ is now known as kurund
15:44  danheberden: if the solution you're achieving is sending html via ajax, you're doing it wrong
15:45  Hopsy: danheberden: lol why?
15:45  danheberden: all my customers are on rs
15:45  bamccaig: smackapoo: Why don't you start by telling us what the database data looks like. :)
15:45  danheberden: :p
15:45  Hopsy: i will inform them :p
15:45  serio: is there a psuedo selector, or another equality efficient way to detect if an element is binded?
15:46  danheberden: element is binded?
15:46  serio: or .live()d
15:46  danheberden: you mean read the event data?
15:46  smackapoo: The database consists of enriched text
15:46  smackapoo: thats it
15:46  smackapoo: pretty simple
15:46  danheberden: serio, have you looked at $('whatever').data('event')
15:46  serio: nope, but I will now.
15:47  bamccaig: smackapoo: What do you intend the slider to do for you? Transition between records of "enriched" text?

15:48  danheberden: :p
15:48  bamccaig: smackapoo: No need to yell. ;)
15:49  serio: hey man, at least you corrected yourself before I came back with:
15:49  serio: "It doesn't work!"
15:49  smackapoo: Simple example: 1. entry: <h1>Hi there</h1> 2. entry: <h2>good to see u</h2>
15:50  smackapoo: First slide should show the first entry and the second slide the second one. The entries should be loaded on demand (ajax)
15:51  smackapoo: However if someone hits another category the slider should be deleted and reloaded with new content
15:51  smackapoo: I better make examples to make myself clear
15:52  bamccaig: smackapoo: Examples would be good. Maybe you can use http://jsfiddle.net (really good site for client-side demos)?
15:52  smackapoo: You should have two buttons, to keep it simple. First button says : "Hello" and second one says "Goodbye"
15:53  bamccaig: I /think/ all you'd need to do is wrap the record data into basic HTML. Something like this: <ul><li>{record1}</li><li>{record2}</li>...</ul>
15:53  danheberden: serio: heh
15:54  smackapoo: When "Hello" is hit the slider should be made visible and be populated with "Ciao", "Hi", "Hallo" ect. When "Goodbye" is hit it should populate the slider with "Arrivederci", "CU" etc. The entries should only be loaded when the button is pressed
15:57  Niels_E: Using UI Tabs, how do I prevent the first tab from being preloaded?
15:57  RTPMatt: Niels_E: just don't put the content in it?
15:57  Niels_E: RTPMatt: Well, I need content in it... the tabs are in a dialog
15:58  Niels_E: RTPMatt: Tabs are loaded with ajax
15:58  bamccaig: smackapoo: It sounds like you could make a server-side script that returns one record at a time. :-/ If you have a list of record identifiers, then you could generate uris with them:   http://foo/bar/baz.php?id={id}
15:58  RTPMatt: Niels_E: so, you don't want it loaded, but you want content in it?  those ideas seem to be in conflict with each other
15:59  Niels_E: RTPMatt: I want content when it's actually shown. But yes, I see your point.
16:00  RTPMatt:  Niels_E: oh, you just don't want it to be seen when the page loads?  you just set its style to "display: none"
16:00  smackapoo: You mean generate a url for each entry and then use that for sudo slider for example?
16:01 --- ugisozols is now known as ugisozols_away
16:01  Niels_E: RTPMatt: No, that's not enough. The tabs are in a dialog, and each tab is filled with ajax. but there's no need to fill any tab before the dialog is shown. I'll try to put an empty, hidden dummy-tab first.
16:02  danheberden: Niels_E - or only initialize the tabs when you show the dialog
16:02  RTPMatt: Niels_E: so you are basically just trying to prevent the first ajax call loading the first tab from going off till you display the tabs?
16:03  RTPMatt: yeah, i think danheberden has it
16:03  Niels_E: RTPMatt: yes, right
16:03  Niels_E: danheberden: yes, that's an idea, thanks
16:04  bamccaig: smackapoo: Yes. Except the URL would be the same for each entry, only differing by ID. The id would be processed server-side.
16:04  Aedous: hmm thanks for your help.. seems I got a bit further now.
16:05  Aedous: However, you know the success callback function
16:05  Aedous: can you pass more than one argument into it ?
16:05  bamccaig: smackapoo: That, or you just use a normal AJAX request, fetch all of the data, and generate an unordered list from it, then embed that in your slider and then call the sudoSlider method on it.
16:07 --- mquin is now known as Mquin
16:08  smackapoo: Both sound like a good idea, however sudo slider has a syntax like this:   ajax[image.jpg,page.html]  The problem here is that I never know how many entries are in it thus I don't know how to populate the variables inside the ajax[] call
16:09  smackapoo: I tried the second one but whenever I tried creating the sudoslider when a click was made the slider got broken for some reason.
16:10  Niels_E: danheberden: Yes, that worked, thanks! Now how can I detect whether the tabs have been init. so I don't do it again and again?
16:10  smackapoo: It seems odd
16:10  danheberden: Niels_E: or the dialog
16:11  danheberden: and just hide/show it
16:11  danheberden: easiest way: $('#idOrWhateverOfYourDialog').is('.ui-dialog-content')

17:18  Mekzholan: youareno6: well, I tried all three of them already :( - might it be that it doesn't work as I didn't insert my $('<div>) into the DOM yet?

17:22  LakWork: youareno6 nevermind i see now, that is weird
17:22  youareno6: LakWork: This is a simplified example.
17:22  ricklamers: Yeah I found the attr thing, but it's like this: <li rel="550">Item1</li><li rel="350">Item2</li> Now I want variable "newTotal" to be equal to 550 + 350 = 900. I know how to select one attr. But thats as far as I get.

17:26  ricklamers: Ah, weird. I never had problems using it. And I could change "rel" to anything because using HTML5 and Javascript custom attributes are supported everywhere

18:04  _ZARDOZ: Thx
18:04  markj: its not styled, what do you expect :]
18:04  RTPMatt: here it opens when you click a buitton: http://jsfiddle.net/4wGnK/8/
18:04  RTPMatt: it is "poped up" when the page loads
18:04  coachz: i don't get this fiddle thing
18:05  coachz: it doesn't look at all like my dialog
18:05  RTPMatt: coachz: it is missing the style shees, so it is not going to look right
18:05  coachz: how to make it look like   http://imgur.com/GPpTr
18:05  RTPMatt: you can add the style shees on the left side if you wanrt
18:06 * coachz is lost as usual

18:07  coachz: that's my current dialog

18:07  coachz: how to get buttons on left and text on right ?
18:08  coachz: that's my current code   https://gist.github.com/734985
18:08  coachz: i thought it would be easy to place text with a button but an hour later i'm pissed again
18:08  RTPMatt: coachz: you need to add the buttons when you make the dialog http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-buttons
18:08  coachz: really ?
18:09  RTPMatt: yes
18:09  coachz: that's what hoses the styling ?

18:09  markj: i imagine
18:10  coachz: how do you add a radio button in jquery dialog ?
18:10  coachz: if it will style them i'll do it there

18:10  prestonparris: does anyone know of a solution to using jquery resizable with snap to grid and ghosting or visual feedback? when i try to use both, the visual feedback adheres to the grid but when I let go of the mouse click it resizes to wherever my mouse left off
18:10  RTPMatt: coachz: like i said jsfiddle does not have your styleshees, you can include them on the left side if you really want it to look like your site, otherwise, just live with the fact that it wont look right
18:10  coachz: and when you click on the text it selects the radio button too
18:10  coachz: RTPMatt,  i don't know how to include them though
18:11  markj: you need to make the text a label coachz if you want the radio button to check when you click the text
18:11  coachz: i did make it a label
18:11  coachz: how do you add a radio button in jquery dialog ?
18:11  markj: you need to use the label for attribute
18:11  coachz: i did
18:11  coachz: did you look at my code ?
18:12  coachz: https://gist.github.com/734985
18:12  coachz: i'm hearing that jquery needs to add them instead though
18:12  coachz: how do i do that ?
18:12  markj: no i didnt, im trying t understand what on earth you're saying
18:12  markj: what do you mean by button

18:16  markj: what? your code allows that already coachz
18:16  coachz: yeah and it hoses the layout
18:16  coachz: wihout labels it looks fine
18:16  markj: what do you mean hoses? :\
18:16  markj: style them then
18:16  coachz: button on left, text on right

18:29  prestonparris: $('img').live('load', function () {     alert("image loaded: "+this.src); });

18:40  coachz: congrats
18:41  l4rk: efff that
18:41  l4rk: html5 multiple file upload or have them upload one at a time
18:41  l4rk: resorting to plugins to do that is blasphemous
18:42  necromancer`: l4rk: not cross-browser
18:42  necromancer`: you will need a flash alternative somewhere
18:42 @ajpiano: $("img").live("load",fn) doesn't work
18:42 @ajpiano: btw
18:42  l4rk: necromancer`: uploading files one at a time is most certaintly cross browser
18:42  necromancer`: no i mean html5 multiple file upload
18:43  necromancer`: but wouldn't uploading too many one-at-a-time files eventually timeout the server?
18:43  necromancer`: i mean, HTTP has some time limits on requests...
18:49  coachz: how can i get space between my radio button and my text please?    http://www.webdevout.net/test?01_
18:50  coachz: i'm convinced that only a true genius can do it
18:50  eyda|mon: is there a way to get the document.location.search as a json structure or something or must I parse it myself?
18:50  coachz: it appears to require 10 phds in css
18:52  necromancer`: coachz: you're using float improperly
18:52  necromancer`: you should enclose all of those input/labels in a <div> and float that left
18:52  coachz: i can try that
18:52  necromancer`: then, you can pad-left the labels and create any space you want
18:52  necromancer`: be careful with float...unexpected results on earlier browsers
18:53  serio: coachz, http://www.webdevout.net/test?021
18:53  coachz: serio, that looks great
18:53  serio: input[type=radio] {margin-right: 20px;}
18:53  coachz: thanks, trying now
18:53  serio: just call me a css 'genius' ?
18:53  coachz: for sure !
18:54  croby: serio coachz you actually shouldn't enclose the input in the label
18:55  coachz: how should it be
18:55  serio: heh, I didn't even notice that.
18:55  coachz: label /label input ?
18:55  eyda|mon: Anyone?
18:55  croby: <input/><label>labeltext</label>
18:55  coachz: k
18:55  croby: it can be on either side of it
18:55  serio: I didn't even look at the markup
18:56  serio: I just wrote the css rule, haha
18:56  croby: serio i didn't either until the css wasn't behaving as it should
18:56  serio: strange, the rule I wrote still worked, oddly enough
18:56  croby: a simple margin-left or padding-left on the label should have done the trick
18:56  coachz: now it's worse ...
18:57  croby: coachz: yes, bc your css isn't correct either :)
18:57  croby: coachz: make the only rule on the label be padding-left:10px
18:57  necromancer`: serio: that's not valid CSS2
18:57  necromancer`: so it's not compatible across all browsers
18:57  necromancer`: IE doesn't understand that kind of selector
18:57  lanmower: this is all a little off-topic isnt it?
18:57  necromancer`: the only way to make it understand that kind of selector is by using jQuery, which slows down performance
18:57  coachz: http://www.webdevout.net/test?022
18:57  necromancer`: it usually gets pretty off topic in here lol
18:58  serio: I'm pretty sure IE7+ will pick up attribute selectors
18:58  serio: I don't give a fuck about IE6
18:58  necromancer`: that's good
18:58  necromancer`: i'm glad you make money as a web developer
18:58  serio: also, I just wrote the rule
18:58  coachz: so now the radio buttons are on the wrong side
18:58  serio: he could easily add a class to each input instead
18:58  croby: coachz: read my lines above
18:58  coachz: how to get them on the left again
18:58  necromancer`: and you are in the real world with the rest of us
18:58  coachz: ok
18:58  necromancer`: who have to develop for IE6
18:59  serio: jesus people, it's just an example
18:59  necromancer`: :)
18:59  serio: like I said, if he needed it to work in ie6, he could class them all properly and do it that way
18:59  coachz: looks like crap still
19:00  croby: http://www.webdevout.net/test?023
19:00  croby: coachz: ^^
19:00  croby: the /only/ rule should be the margin-left
19:00  coachz: yeah but in my jquery dialog it looks wrong
19:00  serio: OMG
19:00  croby: well then your css there isn't correct :)
19:00  serio: it looks fine on the page you're sharing with us.

19:01  serio: that looks pretty awesome to me.
19:01  coachz: for a retard maybe

19:01  Brodingo: g_ $(".class1.class2")

19:01  g_: ah, thanks guys
19:01  croby: Brodingo: whoa
19:01  coachz: labels suck
19:02  ricklamers: Google dropped Compatibility for IE6 so it's not like we developers should keep supporting it. Just give an error with an option for new browser download.
19:02  coachz: what a stupid idea
19:02  croby: coachz: stick with it
19:02  coachz: no i'm fed up
19:02  coachz: 2 HOURS now
19:02  coachz: on this stupid shit

19:02  eyda|mon: necromancer`: do you know ?
19:02  Brodingo: croby great minds
19:02  necromancer`: just fixed it
19:02  necromancer`: change "padding" to alter distance between radio & text
19:02  necromancer`: come on, this is easy
19:03  necromancer`: eyda|mon: huh?
19:03  eyda|mon: necromancer`: is there a way to get the document.location.search as a json structure or something or must I parse it myself?
19:03  coachz: necromancer`,  fail !
19:03  necromancer`: eyda|mon: i'm not sure
19:04  coachz: http://imgur.com/J72Xy
19:04  necromancer`: coachz: well, if you extract the markup/css and it behaves normally, there's something wrong elsewhere in the dialog or document
19:04  coachz: wonderful
19:05  coachz: so i quit, thanks
19:05 * coachz kills off labels
19:05  necromancer`: yeah i mean, you don't HAVE to use labels
19:05  g_: i really hate tooltips that pull html from the title attribute
19:05  g_: it doesn't degrade nicely
19:05  coachz: sucks working on other peoples projects
19:05  necromancer`: OH
19:05  necromancer`: then yeah you better just use text
19:05  necromancer`: i just had to do this with a site that uses flash
19:05  necromancer`: they wanted iOS compatibility
19:05  necromancer`: and IE6 compatibility
19:06  necromancer`: so i had to play with this code that was using shadowbox, SpryEffects and a plugin called IEPNGfix that caused 20-30sec load times on each page
19:06  coachz: i do thank you all for trying
19:06  necromancer`: in addition, there was so much extra markup and CSS code that jQuery/IE had trouble parsing the documents
19:06  g_: what's the name of that little inline mp3 player which when not playing is just a play button?
19:07  necromancer`: g_: the one you see on blogs all over the place?
19:07  g_: yeah
19:08  RefriedWork: hi, is there a more idiomatic way to get the first element returned by a query than $("id")[0] ?
19:08 @ajpiano: you can use .get(0)
19:08 @ajpiano: but there's no point really
19:10  RefriedWork: i'm trying to modify someone else's code and don't know too much about jquery.  i'm trying to get the number of cells in a tr element that was selected using row=$("id").   row.cells is undefined though, and row is an Object[ ], with the first element being the HTMLTableRowElement
19:10  RefriedWork: row.append seems to work
19:10  RefriedWork: so i was surprised that row.cells didn't
19:10  RefriedWork: row[0].cells would, i assume
19:10 @ajpiano: RefriedWork that's cause append is a jquery method, and cells is a native property
19:10  RefriedWork: ajpiano: ok i figured it was something like that, thanks
19:11 @ajpiano: you could just do row.children().length
19:11  RefriedWork: ajpiano: is there a more jquery-like way to do what i want, or is row[0].cells totally reasonable
19:11 @ajpiano: ^^
19:11  RefriedWork: ah i see
19:11  RefriedWork: are they equally acceptable, or is row.children() more acceptable? :-D
19:11  RefriedWork: (thanks btw)
19:12 @ajpiano: that's really in the eye of the beholder :)
19:12  RefriedWork: fair enough
19:12  RefriedWork: i guess there aren't supposed to be any elements other than th/td inside a tr right, that would throw off my count?
19:12 @ajpiano: correct
19:12 @ajpiano: that is why went with children instad of children("td")

19:16  Ely2: is there a way to load certain parts from jcarousel only on the next or previous click? I got like 500 elements and ofcourse my webpage is loading slow. I googled a bit but don't really find something
19:16  necromancer`: g_: that's a wordpress plugin of some kind
19:16  g_: serio: for 2 tiny mp3 files, no!
19:16  g_: necromancer`: yeah, but it's using a flash mp3 player of some sort
19:16  Ely2: seems like I googled wrong I found some things, if anybody ha an idea let me know
19:17  necromancer`: you can make one of those pretty easily with SoundManager2 though
19:17  necromancer`: you just need to configure it right
19:17  necromancer`: if not that try jPlayer, that's another slim HTML5 <audio>-based audio player
19:17  necromancer`: i'm working on a project right now that uses SM2
19:18  necromancer`: it's basically a music store so it's gotta have it. it either uses <audio> provided by SoundManager2 to play files or a SWF on browsers that don't accept HTML5 yet
19:18  necromancer`: the great thing is that the flash file only plays the audio and sends metadata to the player widget, so the controls are the same regardless.
19:18  serio: the reality is that you should still being using flash even if you are using <audio>
19:19  g_: sheesh, all i need is a little swf file to pass in an mp3, and if it's there, play it!
19:19  serio: the jPlayer one looks pretty nice actually.
19:19  necromancer`: g_: that's pretty much what these plugins do
19:20  necromancer`: i'm just creating something that requires selection and loading of different tracks
19:20  necromancer`: and SoundManager2 works well and fast for that
19:20  necromancer`: so if it's not too hard to configure, it might be a good, fast and clean option for you
19:20  g_: yeah sm2 nice and all that, but until html5 becomes a standard, i'm not touching it yet
19:20  serio: the volume slider on this thing doesn't actually 'slide'
19:20  g_: i don't want to then have to browser test
19:20  necromancer`: g_: "Fallback to Flash for MP3/MP4 support, as needed"
19:20  necromancer`: it does it for you

19:41 @ajpiano: that's what i was gonna suggest

19:41 @ajpiano: RefriedWork, do something like var c = row.children(), l = c.length;  c.filter("[colspan]").each(function() { l = l + parseInt($(this).attr("colspan"));   });
19:41  RefriedWork: oooh
19:42  RefriedWork: lambdas, thanks
19:42  RefriedWork: oh no
19:42 @ajpiano: oh you'd have to subtract 1 from the colspan
19:42  RefriedWork: in the process  of trying to copy that line, i cleared the chat buffer instead
19:42 @ajpiano: so you don't double-count it
19:43  RefriedWork: could you send it again?
19:43 @ajpiano: RefriedWork, do something like var c = row.children(), l = c.length;  c.filter("[colspan]").each(function() { l = l + (parseInt($(this).attr("colspan")) -1) ;   });

19:53  dilvie: haha, that's very good
19:54 @ajpiano: also i'm sure you are familiar with see ?jsisjs
19:54 @bot-t: When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
19:54  dilvie: just means my logging code is going to be longer than expected.

19:56  dilvie: I've just been doing feature detection for so long, I don't remember the last time I looked for a browser string. Was years ago.
19:56  igors: hi. does animate() works with {visibility: 'hidden'} ?
19:56  dilvie: probably why jQuery doesn't make it a one-liner. ;)

20:47  d4ft: ok
20:47  d4ft: so im running this little bit of code
20:47  d4ft: http://codepad.org/Tv24h0pT
20:47  d4ft: the table is dynamically generated
20:47  d4ft: but the results are included
20:47 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 88 seconds
20:47  d4ft: no firebug errors or anything
20:47  d4ft: but
20:48  d4ft: no sorting functionality
20:48  d4ft: and the table is not altered in anyway
20:48  d4ft: ive tried to run it in the console as well once everything is loaded up
20:48  d4ft: but no love
20:48  Ely2: FunkyDude: .... i have the carousell fully set up .. but I have not an idea how to load those items step by step (wen I click on next)
20:48  Ely2: was looking for some examples but none are available
20:48  Ely2: at first sight, and second sight :p
20:48  Trisox: d4ft how do you load it?
20:49  d4ft: trisox: how do you mean
20:49  Trisox: the table
20:49  d4ft: document.ready?
20:49  d4ft: oh
20:49  d4ft: i load it in a rails view
20:49  Trisox: no .. you use ajax json or just
20:49  Trisox: dynamicly or not dynamicly
20:49  d4ft: so no dynamic loading (although that will happen later)
20:50  gnarf: d4ft: whats .length of that selector?
20:50  d4ft: one sec.
20:50  gnarf: $('#article-table:has(tbody tr)').length
20:50 @ajpiano: d4ft, tablesorter provides a method for telling it "i have added new rows, you must update"
20:50  Ely2: FunkyDude: http://www.allposters.com/ this site uses ajax to load the rest in the carousel
20:50  _ZARDOZ: when did "ui.core.js" become "jquery.ui.core.js"?  and by which version did it occur?
20:50 @ajpiano: _ZARDOZ, jquery ui 1.8
20:50  d4ft: gnarf: 1
20:51  d4ft: ajpiano: yeah, but there is no dynamic loading going on when the page is first loaded
20:51  gnarf: so, .tablesorter() should have a table to work with... i'm not 100% sure... firebug $.fn.tablesorter?
20:51  _ZARDOZ: Thx ajpiano
20:51  _ZARDOZ: I got a book that's a year old and it's junk now
20:51  d4ft: yeah it returns function

20:55  d4ft: tried both
20:55  Trisox: d4ft wy not use $('#article-table table').tablesorter();
20:55  Trisox: that one
20:55  d4ft: ok
20:55  d4ft: lemme try
20:56  d4ft: trisox: that returns length=0
20:56  Trisox: oh
20:56  Trisox: i mean this one right ? http://tablesorter.com/docs/
20:56  d4ft: thats the table name
20:56  d4ft: that is the one
20:56  d4ft: yup
20:57  Trisox: there example just does  $("#myTable").tablesorter();
20:57  d4ft: yeah i did that too
20:57  d4ft: didnt work

20:59  randomOfAmber: hello.  I'm going to make two lists, one that always has the same items, and you can drag items off of it into the second list.  you cannot rearrange the first list.  the items in the first list are disabled (not droppable) after you add them to the second list.  should I use http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable ?  or just use draggable widgets and make something new?
21:00  gnarf: random question... the error(), complete() and success() functions of an AJAX request are called in the context of the object passed to $.ajax() right?
21:00 @ajpiano: gnarf, yes, by default
21:00  gnarf: doesn't seem to be documented in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax ever since the `context` parameter was added

21:01  stygyan: http://jsfiddle.net/eafPm/
21:01  gkatsev: if I have an AJAX request and the returned JSON is not a string but actually the array, is jquery going to freak?
21:01  stygyan: i can't make this work, no matter how much i try
21:02 @ajpiano: gkatsev, how could an ajax request return something that's not fundamentally a string
21:03  gkatsev: ajpiano: um... I dont know. But basically I get something like ["foo", "bar", "baz"] rather than '["foo","bar"]'
21:04  gnarf: i remember seeing that in the documentation at some point, but it appears to be missing now...
21:04 @ajpiano: gkatsev, and have you ever looked at a response that returns json before?
21:05 @ajpiano: gkatsev, you don't need the actual string literal wrapping it to be part of the response
21:05 @ajpiano: regardless of wheher it's an object or an array
21:06  gkatsev: ok
21:07  gnarf: ahh - nvm found it

21:11 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
21:11  JRGould: haha ARE YOU SOBER ENOUGH?
21:12  JRGould: http://jsfiddle.net/JRGould/5ehDf/
21:12  JRGould: just wondering if there's a way to more gracefully reject duplicates from being dropped on the sortable
21:12  JRGould: possibly invoking the draggable's built in 'revert' thinger
21:13 @ajpiano: right now you're just removing it after?
21:13  JRGould: yeah
21:13  JRGould: which - i could add some feedback manually - but I think the revert functionality makes a lot of sense to users
21:13 @ajpiano: off the top of my head, i can't think of anything that actually works for rejecting drops but i feel like there is one
21:13  JRGould: it seems like there should be!
21:14 @ajpiano: under what conditions does it reject?
21:14 @ajpiano: already exists in list
21:14  JRGould: yeah- that's it for now - I just don't want to dupe them
21:14 @ajpiano: JRGould, what if you made it so the droppable accept selector was more specific
21:15 @ajpiano: and then you added a class onto things that had already been dropped
21:15 @ajpiano: so that it wouldn't accept things
21:15 @ajpiano: that had already been dropped
21:15 @ajpiano: ?
21:15 @ajpiano: does that make sense
21:15  JRGould: hmm- would that work? or would you have to re-bind the sortable and droppable everytime the sortable's collection changed?
21:16 @ajpiano: hm
21:17  JRGould: right now the sortable is made droppable by using the connectToSortable
21:17  JRGould: on the draggable
21:17 @ajpiano: i'm thinking something like  accept: '#destination li:not(.moved)',
21:18  prism: good day all, I am currently using $.get to fetch information for my site, is there anyway I can animate the actual information in, not really to bothered about anything to fancy just not quite sure how to go about it, all the information is actually within one of two divs #content or #navbar so... would I animate a height change to zero grab the content and then animate the div back to the right size or...
21:18 @ajpiano: and then you add the class 'moved' to the original element once it's been dropped
21:18  stygyan: i found the error
21:18 @ajpiano: so that the next time they try to drop it, it won't match the accept param and should invoke  a revert?
21:20  JRGould: okay - so then remove the connectToSortable option from the draggable and make the sortable also dropable... use the :not(.moved) - I'll try that out - thanks! I'll let you know how things work out
21:20 @ajpiano: ok, gluck :)
21:23  gkatsev: ajpiano: I guess my problem specifically is that I have an AJAX call that returns a 15MB json document and parsing it works fine in IE. However, in ff&chrome, wihle I get a success code of 200 the responseText is an empty string.
21:23 @ajpiano: rofl
21:23 @ajpiano: 15mb json string
21:23  gkatsev: yep, a list with 70K objects
21:23 @ajpiano: parsing thta on the client side doesn't sound insane to you?
21:23  gkatsev: basically, just testing the most extreme case
21:23  RTPMatt: WOA
21:24  gkatsev: though, apparently, it does not work with a small set either.
21:24 @ajpiano: gkatsev, try opening a 15mb html document and see how much any browser likes that :/
21:24  RTPMatt: i think that counts as extreme
21:24  gkatsev: heh, yeah, extreme to the max (tm)
21:24  gkatsev: But a small set doesn't work either.
21:25 --- mc_plectrum_ is now known as mc_plectrum
21:25  gkatsev: and the json is valid.
21:26  RTPMatt: not so famous last words?
21:26  erichynds: is ur error callback firing?
21:26  gkatsev: jsonlint.com says valid.
21:26  erichynds: maybe the thing timed out
21:26  gkatsev: erichynds: both are firing actually.
21:26  erichynds: impossible
21:26  erichynds: u mean complete+error or success+error ?
21:27  erichynds: maybe you should try loading only a piece at a time
21:27  erichynds: infinite scroll like
21:28  gkatsev: erichynds: in this app we are only going to really load up like 7K items but it doesn't work with a smaller set either. So, set size doesn't actually matter.
21:28  gkatsev: erichynds: yeah, you're right. Only the success is called with a success code of 200 and an empty responseText
21:29  erichynds: so error doesn't fire?
21:31  gkatsev: doesn't seem like it. (Was going by a cow-orker's word)

21:49  _ZARDOZ: the reason I'm inquiring (not to be offensive) is that the accordion menu is way outdated for what jQuery has currently going (went from unordered lists to divisions
21:49  _ZARDOZ: unless you're telling me that jQuery is not mature enough to actually be a presence
21:49 @ajpiano: huh?
21:50  erichynds: wat
21:50  RTPMatt: yeah man, i hate it when things evolve
21:50 @ajpiano: how is a UL an appropriate element for an accordion?
21:50  _ZARDOZ: 3 writwes in ayears time , come on
21:51 @ajpiano: there haven't been three rewrites of jquery ui in the last year, i don't know what you're talking about
21:51  _ZARDOZ: well then if not that many how is it that 7ed. is unordered lists and not divsion practices
21:52 @ajpiano: _ZARDOZ, accordion will work on a variety of markup structures
21:52 @ajpiano: _ZARDOZ, are you talking about the Dan Wellman book?
21:52  _ZARDOZ: Tom Negrino
21:52  gkatsev: ajpiano: it may be that jquery's ajax function is problem. My cow-orker added callback=? to the end of the GET url manually and now it is working just fine. jQuery is supposed to add it automatically, no?
21:53 @ajpiano: huh, are you trying to do JSONP or a regular ajax call?
21:53  gkatsev: apparently, I do want a JSONP call.
21:53  enapupe: Is possible to set an iframe parent without reload it?
21:53 @ajpiano: on the same domian???
21:54  _ZARDOZ: okay, Thanks for the assistance on this small topic, let you know what I've come across afteer a bit
21:54  enapupe: I mean change iframe's parent div to another
21:54  gkatsev: ajpiano: using WCF, it doesn't work otherwise.
21:55  prism: hey all if I have a string such as '?x=y&blah=bleh' how would I split that into an array or some sort of hash table so I could myHash['x'] to get y etc...
21:55  gkatsev: actually, it is just a regular ajax request? $.getJSON('url/path?id=foo&callback=?', function(){console.log(arguments);}); works. but if I take the &callback=? out it fails.

22:50  serio: did you catch my question from earlier today ajpiano?
22:50 @ajpiano: nope
22:51  serio: is checking .data( 'events' ) the best way to see if an element has been bound?
22:51  Prometheus: DAElectric: not that I know of, probably some plugins that can do that for you though
22:51 @ajpiano: kinda
22:51 @ajpiano: in the sense that it is not good
22:51  serio: would it be 'wiser' to say attach a class when you .unbind() and just search for that?
22:52  erichynds: set your own $.data on unbind
22:52 @ajpiano: ^^
22:52 @ajpiano: that would be better, erichynds betterrerr
22:52  serio: thanks gents
22:52 @ajpiano: bottom line, check for program state, not... the existence of an event handler
22:52  serio: yeah
22:53  serio: that's what I figured
22:53  serio: it was danheberden's idea to check .data( 'events' )
22:53  serio: given my question, I guess it was the best way
22:53 @ajpiano: yeah i mean i have told people the same thing
22:53 @ajpiano: but i am giving it to you straight bro
22:54  mathi: hi
22:54  erichynds: it won't exist in .data("events") after unbind, i don't think
22:54  serio: yeah
22:54  mathi: if I disable an input element, will is remove the value also ?
22:54  mathi: *will it
22:55  serio: but it's still something to check against in this case, since I'd be comparting it to other elements that are bound.
22:55  erichynds: mathi, no
22:55  serio: *comparing* rather
22:55  mathi: erichynds, values will  be sent to server ?
22:55  erichynds: no
22:55  erichynds: i thought you mean the value attribute
22:55  erichynds: values will not be sent to server on disabled inputs
22:56  prism: hey all got a little issue with delegate... did I get something mixed up here: http://pastie.org/1363512
22:57 @ajpiano: prism, are you adding new LI's to the page
22:57  erichynds: prism, does #submenu > li exist in the page?
22:57 @ajpiano: or are you adding new A's
22:57  prism: I am repopulating the entire of #submenu
22:57  prism: the actual html is <div id=submenu></div>
22:57 @ajpiano: prism: then you need to do $("#submenu").delegate
22:58  prism: ahhh got it thank you
22:58 @ajpiano: delegate attaches the lsistener to the thing you select
22:58 @ajpiano: so if those things go away, or aren't there
22:58 @ajpiano: no events :(
22:58  prism: should I change the "a" to
22:58  prism: 'li > a'
22:59  dunkel2: hello
22:59  prism: the error I am getting is the confusaing bit, apparently I am missing an expression
22:59  prism: http://www.webdev.ws?js=
22:59  prism: http://www.webdev.ws?js=1
22:59  dunkel2: have anyone had problems with IE and the fadeIn method
22:59  prism: which does not seem to make sence
22:59  dunkel2: like your fadedIn div looks so dark
22:59  dunkel2: or something
23:00  marcamillion: can anyone help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4400957/how-do-i-make-this-carousel-implementation-better ?
23:00  serio: you can make it better by using a trusted plugin
23:01  serio: and not writting this horrid js code
23:01  prism: ah I see why
23:01  erichynds: marcamillion, cache ur selectors
23:01  erichynds: you're selecting the same shit over and over
23:01  serio: AND OVER AND OVER
23:02  coldhead: $($($('#lol')))
23:02  erichynds: use the .eq(1) method instead of the :eq(1) pseudo selector
23:03  serio: marcamillion, just use cycle like the rest of the interwebs
23:03  serio: ?cycle @ marcamillion
23:03 @bot-t: marcamillion, Cycle Plugin | jQuery Plugins - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
23:03  erichynds: try #foo .baz instead of #foo .bar .baz
23:03  marcamillion: heh serio....did you even read the post ?
23:03  serio: no
23:03  marcamillion: ok
23:04  serio: reading's for suckers
23:04  marcamillion: so how can you be answering ?
23:04  coldhead: serio is illiterate you insensitive clod
23:04  danheberden: i saw my name popup
23:04  danheberden: cursed giving advice out of context
23:04 @ajpiano: it's ok dan, i feel your pain
23:05  serio: I understand that there are probablly 'sophisticated' features what you want to implement here, but you should really take a look at some pre-existing code/plugin before rolling your own
23:05  serio: is all I'm really saying
23:05  marcamillion: lol....serio...i didn't roll my own
23:05  marcamillion: I am using Tiny Carousel
23:05  marcamillion: and extending it
23:05  marcamillion: but I need some help getting it functioning like I need it to function
23:06  marcamillion: I have looked at many others out there, but for some reason or another, they didn't suit my needs
23:06  danheberden: function likeINeedItTo() {
23:06  danheberden: its that easy!
23:06 --- losing_ is now known as losing
23:06  marcamillion: Tiny Carousel came close, but it needs A LOT of customizing
23:06 * marcamillion sighs
23:06  serio: we're not all haters
23:06  serio: just me and danheberden
23:06 @bot-t: .triggerHandler(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers attached to an element for an event. http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/
23:07 @ajpiano: marcamillion, erichynds started giving you a bunch of advice...
23:07 @ajpiano: you NEED to cache your selectors
23:07 @ajpiano: it is dreadful for perfomance to do these deeply nested selectors on every click
23:07  marcamillion: oooh...i never even saw that...my bad
23:07  erichynds: bro
23:07  erichynds: come on bro
23:07  serio: there's a lot more than just that going on here though
23:08 @ajpiano: there's a lot going on
23:08 @ajpiano: that is true
23:08  marcamillion: exactly....a nicely crafted response would REALLY help me...rather than just giving me piece meal responses
23:08  serio: and truth is, nobody is going to sit down and break apart all the calculations you're running to see if they can make it more DRY
23:08  marcamillion: that's why I went to the trouble to post the entire picture
23:09  serio: there's like a TON of width / 2, height / 2 stuff going on, and typically if you're looking to align things those kind of calcs can be minimized
23:09 @bot-t: answer better, slaves!
23:09 @ajpiano: marcamillion, you realise that that is a pretty tall order right?
23:09  marcamillion: ajpiano: I know :(
23:10  marcamillion: but I kinda feel overwhelmed with it all
23:10 @ajpiano: understandably
23:10  marcamillion: and just needed someone to take some time to work through it with me
23:10  marcamillion: because I been battling with it for a while now
23:10 @ajpiano: well
23:10 @ajpiano: what do YOU think is wrong with it
23:10  serio: stack of cards man
23:10  serio: stack of cards
23:10 @ajpiano: like what is breaking
23:11  marcamillion: well....as I listed in the post....if you click on the 5-up view
23:11  marcamillion: 4-up view
23:11  marcamillion: i mean...for starters, the border on the right most image disappears
23:11  marcamillion: there are lots of little things that go awry
23:11 @ajpiano: marcamillion, after doing this type of support for 3 years
23:11 @ajpiano: i can tell you this authoritatively
23:11 @ajpiano: people will help you with big picture things
23:12 @ajpiano: people will help you with coding practises, technique whateve
23:12  marcamillion: but then I have to break it down, into small chunks right ?
23:12 @ajpiano: no one wants to help anyone else deal with minute pixel-by-pixel math calcaultions that probably don't belong in javascript
23:12  marcamillion: yeh, I know
23:12  _ZARDOZ: gotz me a "jQuery IN ACTION 2ed." covers jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI 1.8 (there goes the 2012 theory)
23:12 @ajpiano: no, i'm just sayig like, doing all this type of positioning in javascript is generally considered to be not the bet idea anyway
23:12  serio: marcamillion, are you coming from an actionscript background?
23:12  marcamillion: no serio
23:13  marcamillion: i am coming from no bg
23:13  marcamillion: essentiallty
23:13  serio: :D
23:13  marcamillion: so ajpiano you are saying I should use css for that positioning ?
23:13  marcamillion: and not JS ?
23:13 @ajpiano: yes
23:13  marcamillion: but the problem is, it's all dynamic
23:14 @ajpiano: there are measurement units in css besiddes pixels that work nicely for this type of thing?
23:14  serio: you can make things dynamically position with pure css and a little, LITTLE, JS
23:14  _ZARDOZ: Thanlks for the assistance in this, greatly appreciated
23:14 @ajpiano: _ZARDOZ, yeah jq in action is a good one, yehuda is a core dev
23:14  marcamillion: ajpiano: like what ? em ?
23:14 @ajpiano: em, %
23:14  marcamillion: yeh....
23:14  _ZARDOZ: excellent
23:14  marcamillion: hrmm
23:15 @ajpiano: marcamillion, it's just that you're looking to do like what probably would be a few hours of consulting work for free, on here and SO, so you're pretty much gonna have to work it out in bits and take the advice that you get
