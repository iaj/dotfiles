00:00  Cork[home]: sone: ok, what are you calling with .ajax?
00:00  Cork[home]: or .get?
00:00  Cork[home]: or .getJSON=
00:00  Cork[home]: or what?
00:00  sone: $.post('/admin/ajax/listnews/
00:00  Cork[home]: ok
00:01  Cork[home]: ?.post
00:01 @bot-t: jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
00:01  Cork[home]: sone: if you set [dataType] to 'json'
00:01  Cork[home]: jquery will parse your json for you
00:02 --- dub54_ is now known as dub54
00:02  Cork[home]: and you won't need to parse it again
00:02  binni: How do I select this's div? not  $(this) but something like  $(this+" div")?
00:02  Cork[home]: just a speed up tip
00:02  Cork[home]: ?.find @ binni
00:02 @bot-t: binni, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
00:03  Cork[home]: sone: your original question is still the same what ever way you go, use [jsonName] instead of .jsonName
00:04 --- snover is now known as snover|away
00:04  sone: Ok I was given that block of code to parse and loop though my json yesterday. my data is already in json form so how do I modify my loop .. do I just comment out the parase line?
00:05  Cork[home]: ya, if you tell post to use json, it will already be in the form you want
00:05  Cork[home]: so no need for the parsing line
00:05  sone: var news = data[jsonName]; ?
00:05  marcamillion: so once I animate something's opacity to 0, how do I make it go away for good ?
00:05  marcamillion: animate({ opacity: 0 }, 1000 );
00:05  Cork[home]: ya
00:06  marcamillion: I want the element to disappear like I called hide() on it
00:06  sone: ah ok
00:06  Cork[home]: marcamillion: use its complete callback
00:06  sone: thank you i will try that
00:06  Cork[home]: sone: good luck
00:06  Cork[home]: ?.animate @ marcamillion
00:06 @bot-t: marcamillion, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
00:07  marcamillion: so it would look like this: animate({ opacity: 0 }, 1000, hide() ); ?
00:07  Cork[home]: nope
00:07  marcamillion: given that I want the default easing
00:08  Cork[home]: animate({ opacity: 0 }, 1000, function() { $(elm).hide() } ); ?
00:08  Cork[home]: -?
00:08  marcamillion: ahh...interesting
00:08  marcamillion: ok
00:08  tprice: how would i fake a ajax call on jquerymobile?
00:08  Cork[home]: fake?
00:09  tprice: im havong issues loading pages
00:10  tprice: im not using ajax to get data from the server but jquerymobile uses ajax for loading pages
00:10 --- spyrosl is now known as peqnp
00:13  tprice: if i do something like this $('div#log') why does it come up as  [, , ]
00:13  tprice: why is it empty
00:16  tprice: should it not show me the div?
00:17  dabear: tprice: if you have a div with that id, then it will show up
00:17  dabear: tprice: and why do you specify the div?
00:18  dabear: "#log" would be more optimized
00:19  tprice: if there was no did it would come up as just [] not [ , ,]
00:20  tprice: div**
00:21  sone: I need some help please http://pastebin.com/DSBnaghT my use of the json for setting 'news' variable is coming up as undefined. All json and javascript function is posted there. my data seems valid
00:22  tprice: sone: ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side expression in prefix operation
00:23  Cork[home]: tprice: if you have an id, you NEVER have to add a tag name before it
00:23  Cork[home]: thats just waste full
00:24  Cork[home]: id is by defenition uniq, so no need for extra filters
00:24  sone: tprice: so how do i fix var news = data[jsonName];
00:25  tprice: Cork[home] : its not want i asked
00:25  Cork[home]: you mean .length == 2 ?
00:25  tprice: name div name id name class point been it should come up with something in the []
00:25  tprice: and not just [,,]
00:27  Cork[home]: sone: http://pastebin.com/DiFijQsx
00:28  Cork[home]: sone: another side note ;) you sould be able to get the format from the accept header if you want to ^^
00:29  Cork[home]: but requesting it as a param is fine too
00:29  sone: did you change the formatHtmlTable(data, jsonName) function it looks the same?
00:29  tprice: has anyone used jquerymobile?
00:30  Cork[home]: sone: nope i did what i said before to the .post
00:30  Cork[home]: you where still asking for html instead of json
00:34  sone: tprice: changing the html to json made a change. now my console.log(data) is showing up as [object object] how do I use it in my formatHtml function. I guess my problem Is I dont know how to work with json
00:35  Cork[home]: sone: json is like a named array in php or a hash in those language that support that
00:36  Cork[home]: data.var1 for data = { var1 = 'test' }
00:36  tprice: its coming up as "[object object]"  couse your tuning an object into a string
00:38  Figaroo: Need help trying to figure out why my banner image slider is running slower with more slides (40 or so)
00:40  sone: tprice: thank you it makes more sense now. I was working with previous ajax class and I was getting back not [object object] like now but the string version of json. What is the difference is one not valid json?
00:40  sone: because of my html post request instead of json before?
00:42  tprice: its coming up as [object object] as you are dealing with the object and not the string that i think it what you want
00:43  tprice: look inside the object you are trying to use
00:43  tprice: maybe something like myJson.myString
00:43  tprice: you need to look insode the object that is xcoming up as "[object object]"
00:44  tprice: but i dont know as i have not really looked at your code
00:44  sone: how would you know whats inside the object if console.log returns [object Object]. Is there another way to view objects for debugging?
00:45  Figaroo: here http://jsfiddle.net/sammy/ynfbp/
00:45  Figaroo: Notice how the slides are kinda jittery?
00:45  phrearch: hm is var regexp = new RegExp(pattern); isnt supposed to return an object?
00:46  tprice: sone: its turned into "[object Object]" (a string) before it gets to console.log if your using chrome
00:47  tprice: so look back
00:50  sone: Ok I get that console.log turns it into a string. What do you mean by looking back. I still dont get how you would be able to work with the json object without explicitly knowing its structure to begin with
00:51  l4rk: phrearch: it returns a regular expression object
00:51  phrearch: l4rk: when i do an alert, i only see the pattern
00:51  l4rk: phrearch: and that is why you fail
00:52  phrearch: hm, ill try typeof then
00:52 --- carter05_8 is now known as carter05_40
00:52 --- carter05_40 is now known as carter05_14
00:52 --- carter05_14 is now known as carter05_45
00:53  phrearch: hm, its a function
00:53  l4rk: phrearch: when you do alert it does Object.prototype.valueOf.call( new RegExp("/whatever/") )
00:53  linusoleander: How do I select the plain text in a div block?
00:53  linusoleander: Like this: https://gist.github.com/737726
00:53  l4rk: phrearch: no its a fucking object, which is what i just told you
00:53  phrearch: l4rk: it returned a function with typeof, thats all. :S
00:54  linusoleander: Anyone ? Just using text() doesnt work
00:54  linusoleander: Then it selects the content inside the span block
00:55  l4rk: phrearch: i have no idea why typeof would say that, but its definitely a regular expression object
00:55  smooth_penguin: hi, is anyone here familiar with highcharts
00:55  tprice: $41,000 for jquerymobile and it does work why why oh why
00:55  Cork[home]: linusoleander: you could have to close the div, and remove all its children to get that
00:55  smooth_penguin: or well this is more of a json/js question
00:55  l4rk: phrearch: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
00:55  l4rk: first line
00:55  Cork[home]: could==would
00:56  Cork[home]: man...
00:56  Cork[home]: linusoleander: *you could have to clone
00:56  phrearch: l4rk: does it make any sense to compile the regex?
00:56  phrearch: ok thanks
00:56 * Cork[home] gives up and goes to sleep... T_T
00:56  l4rk: i think chrome is just being weird
00:56  linusoleander: Cork[home]: Okey, sounds easy enough
00:56  linusoleander: Thanks
00:59  epaphus: anybody here available for a small job involving design and modification of cosa slider... a jquery popup windows PM me please.
00:59  smooth_penguin: im trying to access the data object, http://highcharts.com/ref/#series
00:59  eponym: Is there a way to use wildcards or OR in selectors? I want to select for the class "priority-1", "priority-2", or "priority-3"
00:59  smooth_penguin: im not sure how Im supposed to print it out, ive tried alert(series[0].data);
01:00  wookiehangover: ? console
01:00 @bot-t: Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
01:00  smooth_penguin: in my case the array looks something like data: [[5, 2], [6, 3], [8, 2]]
01:01  wookiehangover: smooth_penguin: console.log(series[0]["data"])
01:01  wookiehangover: with webkit inspector or firebug
01:01  Figaroo: Strange. My script is slow in newer browsers (IE8 and Chrome) because I don't have visibility set to hidden or display set to none. But in IE6&7, it's fast. O.o
01:01  Figaroo: That's unexpected, wouldn't you say?
01:03  Vikom: Working on http://fontcomparer.com which is only html/css/jQuery. Anyone know of another way of forcing updates instead of appending ?v=123 ?
01:05  tprice: sone: console.log would pring out the object like an object
01:05  tprice: its not the console
01:06  linusoleander: How do I re-render a view using jquery mobile?
01:06  smooth_penguin: wookiehangover: well the chart.series[0]["data"] is an object - im trying to get to the first array element in data
01:06  smooth_penguin: am I making sense
01:08  tprice: <linusoleander: are you appending it to the page then you want ot re-render it?
01:09  linusoleander: tprice: Yes, thats right
01:09  linusoleander: It looks like Jquery Mobile is adding a lot of css-classes to the element
01:09  tprice: add .page() to the end of appaned()
01:09  tprice: like $().appendTo().page()
01:10  tprice: jquery mobile it pissing me off right now
01:11  linusoleander: tprice: Are you using it?
01:11  tprice: <linusoleander: do you find that the html in jquery mobile is in a kind of limbo?
01:11  tprice: yeah it trying to
01:14  tprice: lnusoleander:  i suggest you use jqtouch as it has had more time worked on it
01:20  linusoleander: tprice: I've already used that, I'm trying to migrate over to jQ mobile
01:25  tprice: lnusoleander:  well its pissing me off right now
01:25  necromancer: i like jQuery Mobile
01:25  necromancer: not for the UI stuff, more so for the new events it created
01:25  tprice: its must work for you then
01:25  dabear: maybe $.mobile.changePage can do that
01:26  linusoleander: tprice: Take a look at icanhaz.js a realy nice way to build templates in jQ Mobile
01:27  necromancer: i haven't really delved too far into it though
01:27  necromancer: i've been using it for sites with jScrollPanes and stuff
01:28  necromancer: so iOS users can swipe up or down and scroll inside the element, much like how scrollballs/2-finger drag works on regular computers
01:30  tprice: jq moble has a long way to go
01:31  necromancer: well it did just get released lol
01:34  tprice: i like things that work
01:37  linusoleander: How do I select the next last item in a list?
01:37  linusoleander: $('li:eq(-2)') ?
01:39  dabear: .eq(-2)
01:39  dabear: ?eq @ linusoleander
01:39 @bot-t: linusoleander, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
01:39  linusoleander: Thanks!
01:40  tprice: why when i do $('body') nothing comes up?
01:40  dabear: tprice: sounds strange
01:41  dabear: are you using a frameset?
01:41  tprice: no
01:42  l4rk: tprice: are you running that in a ready/onload function?
01:42  tprice: no
01:42  l4rk: well..
01:42  l4rk: duh
01:42  tprice: it shouls not matter
01:43  dabear: ?demo @ tprice
01:43 @bot-t: tprice, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
01:45  dabear: no pm
01:45  dabear: plz
01:46  tprice: wanted to save the link
01:48  tprice: its kinda like jquery is been highjacked
01:49  dilvie: hijacked?
01:49  dilvie: check noconflict
01:50  tprice: $('body') should show something
01:50  tprice: this si why my clicks are not working
01:53  snover|away: or it could be because of <l4rk> tprice: are you running that in a ready/onload function? <tprice> no
01:53  dabear: tprice: alert($.fn.jquery)
01:53  dabear: what does that alert
01:53 --- snover|away is now known as snover
01:54  tprice: 1.4.4
01:55  tprice: the page is read
01:56  tprice: its been sitting for 20 min
01:56  tprice: but if i nav around my page the after a bit the $('body') comes up as [] and not [
01:56  tprice: <body class=​"ui-mobile-viewport">​…​</body>​
01:56  tprice: ]
01:59  tprice: maybe i just go back to jqtouch
01:59 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
02:00  dabear: $("body")
02:00  dabear: [
02:00  dabear: <body class=​"ui-mobile-viewport">​…​</body>​
02:00  dabear: ]
02:00  tprice: click around a bit
02:00  tprice: then try
02:02  linusoleander: Anyone knows if it possible to active cross domain xhr in chrome? Like i Safari
02:02  snover: yes.
02:02  linusoleander: Okey, how?
02:03  snover: The exact same way.
02:03  linusoleander: I have not done it in Safari, it did work by defaylt
02:03  linusoleander: *default
02:04  dabear: tprice: display bug only
02:04  dabear: the element is there still
02:05 --- necromancer is now known as necromancer`bzzy
02:05  tprice: is it a known bug?
02:05  dabear: dunno
02:06  tprice: i need to know if its my code jquery or jqmobile
02:06  dabear: you are probably altering the DOMNode base element somewhere
02:07  snover: $('body') is the sillies selector ever anyway…use document.body
02:07  snover: silliest*
02:09  dabear: snover: yes, but the issue is there still :p
02:09  dabear: and "body" is now a direct shortcut to document.body
02:09  snover: dabear: still not as fast
02:09  dabear: snover: well, give me a test
02:10  dabear: i don't remember the name of that test site, but I guess you do
02:10  dabear: :)
02:11  snover: it’s not much of a difference
02:11  snover: whatever operation is actually happening is more expensive
02:14  LeetDog1337: hey guys, http://rdogg.homeunix.net/walls/ , and click an image,  how would i set a max size for it in the slimbox ?
02:14  dabear: tprice: might be a bug in your code, in jq mobile, or in chrome
02:15  dabear: dunno
02:15  dabear: LeetDog1337: slimbox?
02:15  LeetDog1337: yeah, its like lightbox
02:16  dabear: read the docs?
02:16  dabear: ?g slimbox
02:16 @bot-t: dabear, Slimbox, the ultimate lightweight Lightbox clone · digitalia.be - http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox
02:16  LeetDog1337: theres no docs
02:18  dabear: slimbox is based on mootools too
02:18  dabear: so why asking in here? :/
02:19  dabear: oh, ok, v2 uses jquery
02:27  dabear: LeetDog1337: seems it uses the image.height and image.width explicitly
02:34  _zoggy_: man i used to use slimbox back in the day, nice to see he finally did a jquery version
02:37  joshsmith: I just broke some nice modular little code I had and need some thoughts on how to fix it
02:38  joshsmith: essentially in my html I had a div which contained an element
02:38  joshsmith: and a link which had a rel
02:38  joshsmith: when you click the link with a rel, it called .parent().nextAll('someclass')
02:39  joshsmith: unfortunately, I had to change the HTML elsewhere so that the link was another layer deep
02:39  joshsmith: requiring .parent().parent().nextAll('someclass'), which breaks the module
02:39  joshsmith: any thoughts as to how to rectify this?
02:39  _zoggy_: .parent().next().nextALL ?
02:40  joshsmith: I've not used the next() selector before
02:40  joshsmith: wouldn't that not work for the first case though because you're looking for siblings?
02:41  joshsmith: actually wouldn't work in either case
02:42  joshsmith: I suppose I could just change the HTML itself to have an extra, superfluous container div
02:43  joshsmith: but there's gotta be a better way

03:15  Segaja: hi, how can i get the first two children of a div, that are also divs?
03:17  Hopsy: ?eq @ Segaja
03:17 @bot-t: Segaja, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
03:18  maxstoller: Can I use JQuery to select an element that's inside of a frame on the current page?
03:18  Hopsy: yes maxstoller
03:18  Segaja: and .slideUp does not remove the elements, right? so eq would give the hidden elements?
03:19  Hopsy: yes Segaja
03:19  Hopsy: thats right
03:19  Segaja: Hopsy: but i could use the success callback of .slideUp() to remove the element from the DOM?
03:19  maxstoller: Hopsy: Can you point me in the right direction? Not able to select the div in the frame
03:20  Segaja: so .eq(1) would give me the first two elements?
03:20  RTPMatt: maxstoller: you probably need $('frame').contents().find('whateveryouwant')
03:20  maxstoller: RTPMatt: Cool, will give it a shot .. thanks
03:20  RTPMatt: yup
03:22  Dracos: Segaya: $('#mydiv').children('div:lt(2)')
03:22  Dracos: hmm, wait
03:23  Dracos: Segaya: $('#mydiv').children('div').filter(':lt(2)'
03:23  Dracos: )
03:23  Dracos: missed that last one
03:24  Dracos: .eq(1) would give you the second lement
03:25  maxstoller: $('frame[name=content]').contents() is returning an empty array in firebug
03:26  RTPMatt: are you sure $('frame[name=content]') is selecting the frame?
03:27  RTPMatt: console.log($('frame[name=content]')) and see what you get
03:27  maxstoller: [frame] (frame links to the frame in the dom)
03:28  maxstoller: hmm I think I know the problem
03:28  maxstoller: so i pasted the JQuery code in console in FB
03:28  maxstoller: so it loaded it .. but probably only for the current page, not for the frame inside of it?
03:31  RTPMatt: dunno
03:33  snover: maxstoller: you can’t access the contents of a frame that violates the same-origin policy
03:33  maxstoller: ooph
03:34  maxstoller: ok, i give .. was trying to automate a task with javascript, guess i'll have to spend the time and manually do it
03:34  owen1: is there advantage of having a form or can i simply have a button without form? in both cases i grab the data of the different fields with jquery.
03:36  RTPMatt: owen1: supporting people without javascript would be one advantage
03:40  aro: when setting a value via a json response, if that value has an apostrophe in it, it breaks the output - how can i fix this?
03:43  RTPMatt: aro: you probably need to escape it
03:43  jpic: aro: escape the output before it's sent to the browser
03:43  owen1: RTPMatt: good point
03:43  snover: aro: You’re doing it wrong.
03:44  snover: aro: Every single language has a library for generating wellformed JSON. You need to use those instead of trying to roll your own.
03:44  aro: i am using json_encode
03:44  jaja911: Quick Computer question, if I send an email out from a random wifi spot from an address made at another random wifi spot on a computer that is only used for that purpose is there any chance it will be traced
03:44  aro: jaja911: wrong channel
03:45  jaja911: Just say no I know the answer I got to prove this to someone
03:47  RTPMatt: the chance is slightly greater than 0
03:47  aro: var content = "<span class='saved-data'>" + newData.Message.data + "</span><a href='#' rel='" + element + "' rowid='" + newData.Message.id + "' class='submit-entry default-site-button-confirm edit-list-item'>Edit</a>";

03:57  savant: Hi all. Is there any way I can programmatically detect if a browser is a mobile browser?
03:57  savant: jQuery.browser gives only the user agent afaik, which isn't very useful.
03:58  savant: My use case is optionally loading the jquery mobile css/js when the browser is mobile (i've done the necessary work to make my layout work with both stylesheets)
03:58  savant: I would appreciate any help on this

04:07  l4rk: snover: hmmm those would not be able to stop assets from being downloaded
04:07  l4rk: especially when using something like jquery mobile
04:07  snover: depends on the assets, and depends upon what you are doing
04:07  l4rk: yeah i have no idea what savant is doing
04:08  l4rk: but in order to use jquery mobile with a desktop version you need to do UA sniffing or something similar
04:08  snover: Well the thing is, you have to think about what exactly it is that you are changing
04:08  snover: right
04:08  snover: so
04:09  snover: Typically for a “mobile” experience you have a small screen and an alternative touch method for interaction

05:19  brendo^: Hey, how can I get jQuery to retrieve a particular element from a separate HTML file? I don't want the *entire* document, just everything inside a certain <div>
05:20  l4rk: sure but there are some caveats
05:20  l4rk: external resources from that file will be loaded with this approach
05:20  l4rk: like images and stuff
05:21  brendo^: l4rk: are you talking to me?
05:21  l4rk: actually i bet you could do it with $.ajax and set the type to xml
05:21  l4rk: yea
05:21  brendo^: ah
05:21  brendo^: its a really bare document
05:21  l4rk: are you putting that content into another element on your page?
05:21  brendo^: i just need to traverse the document quickly, grab a div (specified by a hash tag link in another document)
05:21  l4rk: if so, $("container").load("url #selector")
05:21  brendo^: then i'm inserting the external element into a <p> tag on my page
05:21  l4rk: yea
05:21  jrockjiggz: brendo^: load(url + ' #divId');
05:21  l4rk: use load
05:22  brendo^: perfect, thanks
05:22  brendo^: to both of you
05:22  l4rk: but if you have any images or stylesheets from that external file they will be loaded
05:22  l4rk: so just be mindful of that
05:22  brendo^: gotcha
05:32  fitzgen: Can anyone help me find a link to the "how to"/guide for pull requests to jquery that was written by Ben Alman (I think)?
05:33  fitzgen: I want to share it with others because I think it is a good guide in general
05:33  fitzgen: my google fu is failing me...
05:34  fitzgen: I swear it was a gist on github...
05:40  brendo^: l4rk, could you tell me what i'm doing wrong? I want to load the element from the external page that has the same ID as the link that is clicked on the parent page: http://brendanstromberger.com/ec2/functions.js
05:40  brendo^: l4rk: main page is at www.brendanstromberger.com/ec2/ (trailing slash required)
05:41  l4rk: brendo^: fyi ($()) isn't necessary
05:41  l4rk: just need $()
05:41  tonysan: how do I change some class style instead of id?
05:41  l4rk: brendo^: you need a space between .html and theHref
05:41  l4rk: and you need to add a #
05:41  l4rk: $("#masthead p").load("desc.html #" + theHref);
05:41  l4rk: like that should work
05:42  l4rk: tonysan: thats a very basic question that a quick google would answer, but $(
05:42  l4rk: $(".className").css()
05:42  brendo^: oh great
05:42  brendo^: thanks l4rk
05:42  l4rk: np
05:42  tonysan: l4rk: (#id) to (".class") ?
05:42  l4rk: yes
05:42  brendo^: l4rk: if you wouldnt mind, if I wanted this to transition with a nice fade, how might i do that? do i need to add a callback function to load() ?
05:43  l4rk: yeah def, do soemthing like $(masthead).hide().load("url", function() { $(this).fadeIn("slow") })
05:49  l4rk: brendo^: all good?
05:49  brendo^: l4rk: www.brendanstromberger.com/ec2/ - its working somewhat, but if you are in firefox (not sure about webkit) notice the browser's scrollbar as you go over the icons
05:50  l4rk: brendo^: not seeing anything in os x firefox
05:50  brendo^: odd, i'm on os x firefox.
05:50  brendo^: 3.6.13
05:50  l4rk: ah my resolution is probably larger :-p
05:50  l4rk: i just shrunk the window
05:50  l4rk: and can see the jumpiness
05:50  brendo^: ah yes
05:51  l4rk: fyi brendo^: if you do jQuery(function($) { // you can do the ready function and localize $ to your code
05:51  l4rk: instead of $(function() {
05:52  l4rk: hmmm try fadeTo(0,0) instead of hide
05:52  brendo^: l4rk: What are the ramifications of that?
05:52  l4rk: see if that helps any
05:52  l4rk: brendo^: the ramifications of your current code is that $ could be overwritten by something else
05:52  brendo^: ah
05:53  l4rk: by doing jQuery(function($) { you guarentee that within your code $ will map to window.jQuery
05:53  brendo^: like this? $("#masthead p").fadeTo(0,0).load("desc.html #" + theHref, function() {
05:53  l4rk: yea
05:53  brendo^: thats not working
05:53  jpic: hi all, i'm trying to integrate JSONSuggestBox into my existing design, the problem is that the suggest box is invisible unless i remove "position: absolute" from the css (extract: http://dpaste.com/285790/) ... Any idea what from my existing css could cause the invisibility of the suggest results box?
05:53  brendo^: l4rk: the screwiness with the bar is gone, however, the content is invisible
05:53  OhaiBBQ: does it throw any errors brendo^?
05:53  brendo^: OhaiBBQ: no
05:54  OhaiBBQ: could you link me?
05:54  l4rk: brendo^: yeah thats weird
05:54  l4rk: its not changing that opacity at all
05:54  l4rk: hrmmm
05:54  brendo^: OhaiBBQ: www.brendanstromberger.com/ec2/
05:54  l4rk: also you're using 1.3.2?
05:54  l4rk: why?
05:54  brendo^: jQuery? dunno.
05:55  l4rk: use the latest
05:55  l4rk: 1.4.4 is latest
05:55  brendo^: hmm, dunno how i grabbed something old
05:55  l4rk: heh
05:55  l4rk: 1.3.2 is like when i started using jquery
05:55  l4rk: >_>
05:55  brendo^: how the deuce did i grab 1.3x...
05:56  brendo^: l4rk: upgraded.
05:56  brendo^: l4rk: still no worky
05:56  OhaiBBQ: brendo^: i dont think that this refers to the element you want
05:57  l4rk: $(this) refers to the p
05:57  l4rk: it def does
05:57  OhaiBBQ: it might, in the callback add console.log(this)
05:57  l4rk: i already stepped through the code
05:57  l4rk: it def does
05:57  OhaiBBQ: kk
05:57  l4rk: issue is def with fadeIn
05:57  l4rk: maybe just use fadeTo?
05:58  brendo^: Hmmm. hey l4rk, I just added console.log to $(this) in the callback
05:58  brendo^: take a look at what Firebug spits out
05:58  tsyrak: hi, when i append a div with style="width:somevalue' it just gets ignored... is this documented somewhere?
05:58  brendo^: does that seem unusual to you?
05:58  l4rk: no
05:58  l4rk: its the paragraph tag with opacity of 0
05:59  l4rk: f it
05:59  l4rk: brendo^: just use fadeOut(0)
05:59  l4rk: not fadeTo
05:59  l4rk: fadeTo and fadeIn don't play nicely together
05:59  l4rk: you need (0)
05:59  l4rk: not just fadeOut
06:00  OhaiBBQ: same with fadeIn
06:00  l4rk: yeah he has fadeIn("slow")
06:00  l4rk: i dunno what the deal is with fadeTo and fadeIn not working
06:00  brendo^: hmm
06:01  OhaiBBQ: throw the load in the callback for fadeout
06:01  OhaiBBQ: fadeOut
06:01  l4rk: OhaiBBQ: i had him putting it first so that the content wouldn't jump
06:01  l4rk: before it was loaded
06:02  l4rk: hmmm maybe this...
06:02  brendo^: *brain explodes*
06:03  brendo^: its working *somewhat* right now but its a bit buddy
06:03  brendo^: *buggy
06:04  l4rk: brendo^: i told you to change the ($()) to $()
06:04  l4rk: ...
06:05  brendo^: i must have misunderstood your meaning
06:05  l4rk: brendo^: use stop(true, true) as well
06:05  l4rk: before fadeOut and fadeIn
06:05  l4rk: stop(true, true).fadeOut
06:06  l4rk: are you working on this for amazon?
06:06  brendo^: l4rk: no, its a student project, more or less
06:06  l4rk: gotcha
06:07  OhaiBBQ: he should put the .load in the fadeOut callback so you dont see the content change while it's fading out
06:08  jeremyw: Is it bad taste to use the CSS classes for things they weren't inteded?  Like using the tab header for a table header?
06:09  brendo^: l4rk: I feel a little dense on this, but I'm not quite sure what you mean about chaning the ($()) to $()
06:09  brendo^: my resolution is so tiny, it just now occurred to me that () is two parenthesis and not a zero...
06:09  l4rk: line 3
06:09  jeremyw: I love the jQuery UI for tabs but if I'm going to use the tabs, I'd love to style my tables the same.
06:09  l4rk: you have ($(this)
06:09  l4rk: ($(this))
06:09  l4rk: rather
06:09  l4rk: get rid of the ()
06:10  brendo^: ah, very good, my apologies. i read () incorrectly and it really confused me

06:42  OhaiBBQ: whats wrong with it brendo^
06:43  brendo^: OhaiBBQ: its clunky... the dimensions of the box disappear altogether, so the bar of content beneath it moves up and down way more than it needs to
06:43  brendo^: i need the content of the <p> to fade, but i need the box itself to remain
06:44  OhaiBBQ: fade to 0.01
06:44  brendo^: ooh good idear.
06:44  brendo^: does that mean I should use fadeTo again?
06:45  OhaiBBQ: yeah, but only for the fadeOut
06:57  brendo^: OhaiBBQ:  Any tips on how I could get the original <p> to re-appear once the mouse leaves the area (#masthead) altogether?
06:57  OhaiBBQ: isnt there a hoverout function you can pass to hover()?

06:58  brendo^: do I pass it as a callback function?

08:32  Blink7: i'm using $.post to turn on a cronjob that takes a couple of minutes
08:33  Blink7: after turning it on i'm setting a new request that checks the status every 5 seconds via setInterval
08:33  Blink7: problem is that the second request only works after the first one (the long one) finishes
08:33  Blink7: is this some kind of server configuration?
08:37  stvs: Blink7, browsers won't open more than 2 connections per server at a time
08:37  stvs: Blink7, additionally if you use PHP, sessions will block you from opening more than 1 connection at a time for the same user
08:38  Blink7: stvs: I'm quite sure that this is not the case, I got this working on a server a while back, but now I'm reproducing it locally and it doesn't work
08:38  Blink7: gotta be the server config

09:46  joshsmith: and then in the function use .stopPropagation?
09:47  tprice: umm

09:49  joshsmith: ruby_on_tails: done
09:50  ruby_on_tails: joshsmith: fun
09:50  joshsmith: I'm trying to figure out how to use .delegate on a checkbox
09:50  ruby_on_tails: hmm
09:50  ruby_on_tails: try live ?
09:50  joshsmith: can't use live. trying to use .stopPropagation
09:51  joshsmith: basically I have a checkbox and something beneath it that's clickable
09:51  tprice: what about .change
09:51  tprice: dont really knwo what .stopPropagation does
09:51  joshsmith: when it's the checkbox that's clicked, I want to stopPropagation on that
09:51  joshsmith: tprice: it stops the event bubbling
09:51  ruby_on_tails: joshsmith: simply do return false
09:51  joshsmith: the click will register on the clickable element beneath it otherwise
09:51  tprice: return false
09:51  joshsmith: ruby_on_tails: that doesn't work
09:52  tprice: oh haha
09:52  ruby_on_tails: return false should work
09:52  joshsmith: it'll stop the checkbox from being checked
09:53  jester831: so, i'm using $.ajax with error and success functions and am randomly getting success triggers on errors, thoughts?
09:53  tprice: event.preventDefault();
09:53  joshsmith: tprice: that doesn't work either, tried that to no avail
09:53  joshsmith: it'll also prevent the default, which is the checkbox getting checked
09:53  jester831: I'm getting both the exit and die messages on success, and i wasn't getting those results earlier so I'm rather perplexed
09:55  tprice: josh: .chage will give you an event for the checkbox
09:55  tprice: but dont know what your try to do
09:55  tprice: jester831: randomly maybe a missmatch of functions?
09:55  joshsmith: tprice: I need it to be live
09:56  joshsmith: and to stop the propagation on the click below
09:56  joshsmith: the most important thing is stopping the click propagation
09:56  joshsmith: but not at the expense of having the checkbox left unchecked
09:57  tprice: test for a checkbox change and if so return false on the  click below
09:57  tprice: return false will stop the  click below from doing anything
09:57  jester831: I don't think so; my error function handles die messages, and my success handles an echoed json
09:59  jester831: php die should always trigger the error function?
09:59  jester831: or is exit more suitable
10:01  tprice: jester831: are you testing for an error?
10:01  jester831: well, it's a login file that echos out form information
10:02  jester831: the success/error is to either log in and echo the form info, or to display the error
10:04  tprice: return json object for login or not login and only and error for server error that was not to do with the login
10:04  sone: http://pastebin.com/MUe8tkeh is there a way for me to get key and value of a json Object I don't know the length of or its fields?
10:06  tprice: sone for in should work
10:07  tprice: i is the key and news[i] would be the val
10:08  sone: ok I'll try output the keys in the loop
10:08  joshsmith: tpri
10:08  jester831: well, I was only doing or die with htmlentities, no input and is_wp_error
10:08  joshsmith: tprice: did you mean return false generally, or return false on the click specifically?
10:08  joshsmith: if the latter, I've no idea how to do that
10:09  joshsmith: if the former, still not allowing the check to register for soem reason
10:09  joshsmith: wait nvm
10:09  joshsmith: it is registering the click, so I think you meant the latter
10:12  joshsmith: tprice: can you explicate?
10:13  tprice: joshsmith: what would the code look like
10:13  joshsmith: $(':checkbox').live('change', function() { return false; });
10:15  tprice: joshsmith: that will stop the checkbox from changing
10:15  tprice: but you said there is a click element below?
10:15  tprice: you want to stop that or the checkbox?
10:15  joshsmith: not for me
10:15  joshsmith: the text box changes just fine with that code
10:16  joshsmith: which makes sense; you're doing a function after the change has already happened
10:16  joshsmith: in which case wouldn't it also make sense that a return false wouldn't stop the click below, either?
10:18  tprice: with .live('change' there is no click and retuning false for a change will not affect the click
10:19  tprice: but what i was saying is that you might have to deal with both the change and click
10:19  tprice: but again "i think"

10:23 --- eir sets modes [#jquery -qo *!*@66-168-255-112.static.mtgm.al.charter.com eir]
10:24  joshsmith: yeah, there's the checkbox, and an element below it
10:26  tprice: on the element below add the return false if the checkbox has changed
10:27  tprice: but i dont really know might help if someone else knows more about it
10:28  joshsmith: how do you mean add a return false
10:28  joshsmith: in the $(':checkbox').live('change', function() {}); ?
10:29  joshsmith: or in a $('.element-below').live('click',function () {}); ?
10:29  joshsmith: it'd be best if you could just JSFiddle what you mean here: http://jsfiddle.net/g5bn4/3/
10:31  joshsmith: this is what I thought you meant, which doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/g5bn4/4/
10:31  joshsmith: but that's probably not what you meant
10:34  tprice: ahh i see what you mean
10:34  tprice: give me a sec
10:35  joshsmith: np, and thanks for the help thus far
10:37  tprice: when do you want to apply the css to .page?
10:37  joshsmith: sorry, got kicked
10:37  tprice: when do you want to apply the css to .page?
10:38  joshsmith: only when it's clicked directly, but not when the checkbox above it is clicked
10:45  joshsmith: this is maybe a bit of a hack, but maybe I could just bind the stopPropogation to the checkbox click after the AJAX call
10:51  tprice: its really messy sorry but it work i think http://jsfiddle.net/g5bn4/5/
10:51  tprice: yeah it work

10:58  joshsmith: tprice: trying now
10:59  tprice: _ZARDOZ: what are you tring to do?
10:59  tprice: _ZARDOZ: sorry dont know about Accordion
11:01  _ZARDOZ: I am trying to get a custom ThemeRoller design/look to an Accordion that fits the look of a Webpage, I'll be using the Accordion as a collapsible navigation menu about 120px wide
11:03  _ZARDOZ: I just can not seem to get the custom look files in right or something to have it function and look they way the theme provides
11:03  joshsmith: tprice: I'm still not sure this is doing what I want (my case is slightly more complex than the the JSFiddle)
11:05  _ZARDOZ: it is all jQuery
11:06  tprice: joshsmith: but you get the idea of stoping the click from doing anything
11:07  _ZARDOZ: thanks Tprice
11:10  tprice: _ZARDOZ: sorry not to much help on that

11:16  _ZARDOZ: I attempted to provide as much existing information that could be of assistance on the webpage
11:18  tprice: no yeah that was cool haha lots of pics
11:18  tprice: dont know what they where for
11:19  tprice: but agian didnt really read it
11:20  tprice: nn all
11:23  _ZARDOZ: The pictures are all the files in the Web Hosted Account (hierarchy) just for the jQuery Accordion Menu (I believe that the basic/generic Accordion Menu files are some how paralleled with the jQuery Accordion ThemeRoller Custom Design files
11:24  _ZARDOZ: Thanks for looking though Tprice, night
11:26  joshsmith: tprice: that ended up working, though at the cost of something else
11:26  joshsmith: I had a div around the checkbox that activated a check as well, and it just screws things up to have that
11:31  joshsmith: well, I implement a half-measure at least
11:32  joshsmith: I just made the div around the checkbox return false
11:32  joshsmith: well, I mean, set click = false
11:32  joshsmith: that way it doesn't register the click on the element below
11:32  joshsmith: so that someone with a kludgy click has the wrong interaction (they intended to click the checkbox but failed)
11:33  joshsmith: but ideally I want like a whole 10px area around the checkbox to be clickable as though it were the checkbox itself
11:34  _ZARDOZ: imagemap area joshsmith
11:34  joshsmith: _ZARDOZ: howso?
11:35  joshsmith: I've never really used imagemaps before
11:39  _ZARDOZ: I'm not a wizard at any of this web development but I know an image (pic of a checkbox (x2: one empty box and one chk'd box)) can be made to have a surrounding area that is activatable (I used homemade graphics from PhotoShop/ImageReady 7) and when making a clickable rollover it can be accomplished
11:39  sone: is there any avaiable class that will take a json data object and put all records into an html table and has paging feature?

11:44  sone: ok thank you ^^
11:48  _ZARDOZ: maybe joshsmith  you could make a surrounding area of the checkbox a "ui-selected" area, may just mean a little more div work to encapsulate the checkbox
11:48  joshsmith: _ZARDOZ: that's basically what I've done already
11:48  joshsmith: just doesn't play nicely with the other code

11:57  joshsmith: actually found a nice SO answer on that
12:08  joshsmith: nice! got it working
12:08  joshsmith: I was making a tooltip navigator like Gmail has
12:09  joshsmith: and wanted the screen position to change if the tooltip wasn't visible anymore
12:12  _ZARDOZ: congrat's joshsmith, always nice to see the fruition come
12:13  joshsmith: _ZARDOZ: yeah, this is looking really sweet
12:13  joshsmith: it's a Gmail-inspired task manager
12:13  joshsmith: complete with keyboard navigation and in-line editing
12:14  _ZARDOZ: I see you smiling :)
12:14  joshsmith: so you click a task and it slides down the editor

12:20  _ZARDOZ: that's impressive, maybe someday I'll be there doing that, I'm just getting started with jQuery and it appears the latest updates have not really made into the old examples yet, I'm a bit stymied at the moment
12:20  _ZARDOZ: your checkbox was the "Due Today" checkbox?
12:25  _ZARDOZ: I remember working with VSBasic years ago to make small ditties, the aspects have changed considerably since then with all this new server side scripting and whatnot's
12:26  joshsmith: it was the checkbox in front of it, yeah
12:26  joshsmith: clicking on the task opens up the editor
12:26  _ZARDOZ: maybe not VSBasic but rather Visual Basic
12:26  joshsmith: so I was trying to prevent the editor from opening
12:27  joshsmith: _ZARDOZ: I recommend reading jQuery in Action
12:27  joshsmith: and also rmurphey's book
12:27  _ZARDOZ: okay, pretty close proximity
12:31  _ZARDOZ: yes, I have just recently purchased jQuery IN ACTION and a jQuery Cookbook (ORIELLY) - I've been bending pages and they all work with the previous version(s) but the latest UI update the ThemeRoller provided has me out in the cold so to speak (new naming convention)
12:33  joshsmith: ah gotcha
12:33  _ZARDOZ: it is rough learning an advanced technique when they changed boats as I was just getting onboard
12:33  joshsmith: I don't use ThemeRoller
12:35  _ZARDOZ: I thought it would be a quick way to provide a styled theme for my page as I am not quick with the keyboard
12:36  _ZARDOZ: page= needed menu for my page(s)
12:37  joshsmith: gotcha, yeah, I've just rolled my own stuff

15:08  alex88: what should .button() do?
15:08  Goldan: The code is in http://pastebin.com/t2aVrFU0
15:09  Goldan: it should turn elements into "buttons", like in http://jqueryui.com/demos/button
15:11  Goldan: the thing is that the line 6 works, and line 7 not.
15:11  Goldan: and I'm using the latest jquery UI and jquery.
15:13  erichynds: are you sure jquery ui is included correctly?
15:14  Goldan: yes, I've just checked all three files (view source -> click link)
15:15  Goldan: and the line 6 works ok: $("a").addClass("ui-widget-shadow");
15:15  Goldan: but $("a").button(); doesn't work
15:16  alex88: mmmhhhh...and without the 6th line?
15:16  erichynds: the only reason button wouldn't work is if it's not included
15:16  erichynds: perhaps you didn't include button() with the custom build?
15:18  Goldan: I will check one more time
15:18  Goldan: without the 6th line it doesn't work neither, the same error
15:18  erichynds: right
15:19  erichynds: line 6 has nothing to do with it
15:19  erichynds: the button widget is not in your custom build, OR the path to  jquery ui is incorrect
15:19  erichynds: you should also be chaining lines 6 and7, so like $("a").addClass("ui-widget-shadow").button();

17:22  Prometheus: or subset of them
17:22  Stava: Prometheus, I have a text input field which will only be shown if the radio button is selected
17:22  foofoobar: http://foofoo.atwebpages.com/ can someone tell me why the elements of the list which appears when you slide over "Aktuelles" are on the left, middle and right? Is it superfish related?
17:22  Prometheus: and then conditionally do something else for those that are selected?
17:22  Stava: Prometheus, as well as on page load
17:22  Stava: Prometheus, just one
17:23  Prometheus: okay
17:23  Prometheus: so what do you have right now then?
17:23  Stava: So the change() function would work
17:23  Stava: But not on page load
17:23  Prometheus: right
17:24  Stava: Prometheus, http://pastie.org/1370353
17:24  Stava: Prometheus, It works fine, but if I reload the page with that radio button checked, the input field is hidden
17:24  Prometheus: Stava: you can trigger a change to it on page load
17:24  Prometheus: .trigger('change')
17:24  Prometheus: to make it run that binding
17:25  Prometheus: if you like
17:25  Stava: Oh
17:25  Stava: yeah I'll do that, thanks
17:25  Prometheus: np
17:25  Prometheus: I'm sure you could do many other ways as well
17:25  Prometheus: but that's probably the easiest with your existing code :)
17:25  Prometheus: Stava: also, instead of doing switch
17:25  Prometheus: you could just test $(this).is(':checked')
17:26  Stava: Prometheus, Well it fades in/out twice on reload and ends up being hidden
17:26  Prometheus: if ($(this).is(':checked')) { // fadeIn } else { //fade out }
17:27  Stava: Prometheus, that wouldnt work, because there are 3 radio buttons which are selected with that code
17:27  Prometheus: oh ok
17:27  Stava: 0, 1 and 2
17:27  Prometheus: couldn't tell from just that code =)
17:27  Prometheus: thought it might be unique
17:27  Prometheus: btw, wouldn't it make to give them all a class
17:27  Prometheus: and use that class selector
17:28  Prometheus: instead of a more complex selector like that
17:28  Prometheus: I think it would simplify that a bit =)
17:28  Prometheus: of course, if you have no control over the html, then that's not an option
17:28  Stava: Well I do, actually
17:28  Stava: I'll simply give it an id
17:29  phrearch: hi
17:29  phrearch: im trying to return an unnamed group from a js regexp, like http://paste.pocoo.org/show/303952/
17:29  phrearch: any idea why i get the whole string as result, instead of just slug?
17:30  Stava: phrearch, (?:...) is not capture-able :o
17:30  phrearch: Stava: should i use () without ?: ?
17:30  Stava: phrearch, skip the ?:
17:31  phrearch: aha that works. weird, i read somewhere that was the syntax to specify unnamed groups
17:31  phrearch: thanks :)
17:31  Stava: phrearch, no thats just like saying you want to group whatever you write inside it, but not capture it
17:31  phrearch: aha ok
17:32  phrearch: named groups dont work in js?
17:32  Stava: phrearch, I dont know, but the way you specify a named group should be (?<name>...)
17:33  Stava: (?P<name>...) perhaps, im not entirely sure
17:33  phrearch: aha, i did that with ?P i think. ill try. thanks
17:34  wrtpeeps: hi chaps, I have a question about the tabs control from jqueryui. Is there a way I can get the selected tab to change after a period of time (i.e. cycle through them). Sort of like "wait 5 seconds,s how tab 2, wait 5 seconds show tab 3" etc?
17:35  phrearch: sure
17:35  phrearch: $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected',selected_tab);
17:35  phrearch: where selected_tab is a number
17:35  manveru: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-select
17:35  wrtpeeps: ah
17:35  wrtpeeps: cool!
17:35  phrearch: and tabs is  $tabs = $('#personal_tabs').tabs();
17:36  wrtpeeps: thanks phrearch
17:36  manveru: actually, there is http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-rotate

17:44  manveru: rchern: http://api.jquery.com/category/offset/ - in particular offset() and scrollTop
17:45  rchern: manveru: Yes, I was going more for if there was a plugin or logic already written. IE, there could be more than 1 post visible on the screen. A single post could be more than 1 screen and you're in the middle of it, etc.
17:46  jorn: heyho, is it possible that the documentation for keydown/press/up events is a bit outdated? http://api.jquery.com/keyup/ It mentions that the second variant (of three) is equivalent to trigger('keyup')... but isn't it the third?

17:50  omglikehello: alright thanks.
17:50  RTPMatt: sure thing
17:51  omglikehello: er, i have download the jquery. but it's in javascript...
17:51  omglikehello: so should i change it to exe?
17:51  omglikehello: And run it via dreamweaver? :\
17:52  RTPMatt: omglikehello: uh, no it is javascript, it runs on a webpage, you so just put it in a javascript tag on the page
17:52  RTPMatt: omglikehello: I am guessing you don't have much experience with javascript in general?
17:53  omglikehello: Yeah..
17:53  RTPMatt: you should probably start with regular javascript and once you feel comfertable with that, start using jquery
17:54  omglikehello: oh.
17:54  omglikehello: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works#Complete_Example
17:54  RTPMatt: jquery IS javascript, so you need to understand javascript to understand jquery
17:54  omglikehello: i'm just looking at this tutorial..
17:54  Holek: is there a reason for not putting stuff in $(document).ready() if the script is loaded at the very bottom of an HTML file?
17:55  RTPMatt: Holek: if the javascript exists in the page after the DOM nodes it works on, you do not need to put it in a .ready (because those nodes will be ready when the JS runs) if you don't need to use .ready, you shouldn't,

18:04  h3llz-2: RTPMatt: i guees there isnt a default effect which mimicks the same effect used by rapidshare.com's dialogs? You know if there'd be any plugins for this?
18:04  RTPMatt: ? someone @ Boohemian
18:04 @bot-t: Boohemian, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
18:05  RTPMatt: h3llz-2: I have no idea, I don't know what rapidshaes does
18:05  h3llz-2: ok
18:07  Boohemian: RTPMatt: evidently the way drupal handles jquery is very specific and i'm not that good with jquery, but okay, here it is... for whatever reason, this code no longer collapses text on my site anymore and i am unsure why: <div class="collapsible-block">text should always display. <span class="collapsed-section">this text should appear hidden until clicked</span></div>
18:07  Boohemian: how do i go about diagnosing what is wrong?
18:07  Boohemian: i diff'ed the jquery file collapse.js from when it worked to now and the only difference is an extra });

18:12  RTPMatt: Boohemian: once you install firebug (www.getfirebug.com) there will be a little firebug in the bottom right of firefox, click it to open firebug

18:17  oal: Is it impossible to animate a background image with background-position? It just jumps to the desired position after the duration has elapsed and no animation
18:17  Stava: Well the ":checked" selector seem to keep the value from when the document loaded and not change after that. http://pastie.org/1370475 will only fade in once, and never fade out
18:17  Stava: or something
18:17  Stava: Or perhaps change() does not do what I think it does
18:24  Boohemian: RTPMatt: and then to look for errors?
18:26  RTPMatt: Boohemian: open it, reload the page, see if you get any errors
18:35  Stava: Oh change() is not called when a radio button gets de-selected! How do I work around this?
18:40  RTPMatt: Stava: you could probably  do a .click and .keyup to capture it?
18:41  Stava: RTPMatt, I'm not sure if I like that solution. I solved it by using a selector for all the radio buttons
18:42  RTPMatt: Stava: yeah, i don't like it either

No one is going to trawl through the channel logs looking to steal awesome intellectual property and code from broken examples that you once posted in a support channel in order to steal your ideas. If you're here for support, don't bring your lawyer.
19:53  dilvie: briMestone: Use jQuery ajax. If you want to learn how it works, look under the hood at the jQuery source, for education's sake -- and then use the library.
19:54  phrearch: hm, regexp returns an array which really sucks if you have named groups :D
19:54  dilvie: There are cross-browser peculiarities you would need to worry about and fork your code for if you don't use the library -- and trying to stay on top of that every time you roll your own ajax call is just stupid.

20:30  Woelfle: italic, I can't recall why but for some reason I always tried to avoid delete. isn't it evil and causing problems sometimes?

20:32  temp01: Woelfle: it isn't great for arrays since it doesn't fill the gap but it's what you want for objects

20:32  dilvie: um.. the current page href

20:33  marcamillion: because it isn't a child or parent
20:33  dilvie: Stava: that's news to me. Try it and see! =)
20:33  Stava: dilvie, I would not state it otherwise :o
20:33  marcamillion: they are both children of the same parent, so how do I get there ?
20:33  temp01: alex88: get rid of >
20:33  dilvie: Stava: and let me know how the cross browser testing goes. =)
20:33  Stava: dilvie, Yeah well that can be a problem
20:33  Woelfle: ok thx for now
20:33  dilvie: Stava: why?
20:33  alex88: temp01, worked.. thanks a lot
20:34  Stava: dilvie, I do have most browsers installed, but not older versions
20:34  italic: is there an internal debugging var that contains the contents of console.trace ?
20:34  dilvie: Stava: try ietester
20:34 @bot-t: italic, csnover/TraceKit - GitHub - https://github.com/csnover/TraceKit
20:34  Stava: dilvie, I do have ie6, but not older versions of the other browsers :o
20:35  dilvie: older versions of other browsers are not really a big deal, because most people smart enough to use other browsers are also smart enough to upgrade them now and then. ;)
20:35  Stava: I guess :p
20:36  dilvie: I'm not guessing. I base that opinion on traffic logs from sites that get LOTS of traffic.
20:36  ajpiano: briMestone_, wat
20:37  Stava: dilvie, Actually the documentation for jQuery.ajax() says that the default value for url is the current page. Is there any documented value which I should use to make jquery use the default value (which is dynamic/unknown)?
20:37  Stava: Such as false, or undefined
20:38  briMestone_: ajpiano http://jsfiddle.net/brimestone/RnJkv/
20:38  dilvie: Stava: no -- just don't specify a value, and the default -- well ... defaults.
20:38  ajpiano: briMestone_ http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/Mxdy3/1/
20:38  Stava: dilvie, But i'm forced to with the element.load() method, because I need to specify the data parameter
20:39  briMestone_: does the "html" side gets updated?
20:39  ajpiano: what html side?
20:39  johnline: http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/ < this page in firefox has some weird symbols at the top
20:39  briMestone_: up on the 1st quandrant
20:39  johnline: how to remove?
20:40  dilvie: Stava: Are you sure?
20:41  _ZARDOZ: that jsfiddle loks pretty intense ... is that code sniffer
20:41  Stava: dilvie, I want to specify a query string
20:42  robgleeson: does jQuery or JavaScript provide anyway to get access to the parameters passed after 'foo?param=value' ?
20:42  robgleeson: s/after/like/
20:42  ajpiano: robgleeson: console.dir(window.location)
20:42  dilvie: Stava: can you paste your code?
20:42  Stava: dilvie, $("#email").load('', 'email');
20:42  Stava: And I dont think the empty string is pretty :p
20:43  ajpiano: huh
20:43  robgleeson: ajpiano: let me see thanks.
20:43  ajpiano: Stava, you want to use .load() but you don't want to use a POST to pass the parameters
20:43  Stava: ajpiano, the data parameter is sent as query string?
20:44  ajpiano: not when you use .load
20:44  _ZARDOZ: no code sniffer, just a compiler
20:44  dilvie: Stava: does it work?
20:44  _ZARDOZ: pretty cool though
20:45  Stava: dilvie, ajpiano: it works, and I use the query string on the server side successfully
20:45  Stava: dilvie, ajpiano: I just dont want to specify an empty string :p
20:45  Stava: Since its not documented
20:45  ajpiano: you do'nt have to
20:45  ajpiano: huh
20:45  ajpiano: Stava, you don't have to pass empty placeholder arguments
20:45  Stava: ajpiano, I want to do the ajax request without specifying an url
20:46  vrtigo: ...
20:46  johnline: ï»¿
20:46  Stava: :o
20:46  robgleeson: ajpiano: hm.. two problems, my object isn't a Location object(it's a string), and I don't see how I could construct a Location object.
20:46  johnline: if this apears on your page, what to do?
20:46  vrtigo: panic
20:46  johnline: :/\
20:48  ajpiano: Stava, then ... what page are you trying to reques
20:48  Stava: ajpiano, The current page
20:48  marcamillion: anyone care to take a stab at my question ?
20:48  ajpiano: Stava, window.location.href
20:48  briMestone_: hey ajpiano.. http://jsfiddle.net/brimestone/RnJkv/1/ it works
20:49  Stava: ajpiano, Cool, is that cross-browser compatible?
20:49  marcamillion: for a quick refresher, http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/selectors_descendant.htm   say I want when the user that clicks on one of those <li> tags, I want the <em> tag that is a child of <p> to get a border, how do I do that ?
20:50  ajpiano: Stava, yes
20:50  Stava: ajpiano, Great, thanks
20:50  grundel: is there a preferred place for code snippets?
20:51  ajpiano: grundel, we prefer you put a working demo on jsfiddle.net, if possible
20:51  dilvie: Stava: that's the same advice I tried to give you 20 minutes ago. ;)
20:51  grundel: thanks
20:52  Stava: dilvie, Yeah I realize, but I did not understand which href you were referring to :p
20:52  johnline: hou tu pranownse inglish?
20:52  Danny``: I'm having a problem with this accordion I am trying to code
20:52  _ZARDOZ: :)
20:52  RTPMatt: marcamillion: $('li').click(function(e){$('p > em').css('border, '...');}); ?
20:52  Danny``: It works great, but the inside div is being set to height: 16px
20:53  Danny``: http://dev.danielimmke.com/svglass/
20:53  grundel: ajpiano, can I just link jQuery there?
20:53  alex88: how can i run a command after an images is loaded? (it's loaded after the page, with javascript calls)
20:53  ajpiano: grundel: look at the frameworks panel on the left
20:53  Danny``: See how the image from the first tab is going over everything?
20:53  johnline: any of you guys know of a site where i can see output in all browsers?
20:53  RTPMatt: ? load @  alex88
20:53 @bot-t: alex88, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

20:54  Andy[1]: guys, if I have this html: <ul><li>foo<ul><li>bar</li></ul></li></ul> is there a clean way of getting rid of the parent ul & li without getting rid of the child ul?
20:54  ajpiano: ?unwrap @ Andy[1]
20:54 @bot-t: Andy[1], .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
20:54  Matthijn: Good Evening :) If it is evening over there too ofcourse :)
20:54  Andy[1]: thanks ajpiano! :)
20:54  Matthijn: Having a Simple question.
20:54  dilvie: Stava: um. How many hrefs are there? =)
20:54  alex88: RTPMatt, i've checked that.. but i have to change the background with a image, and then fade to 1.. i've tried to put the selected link with href to the image and .load but it not works..
20:54  Danny``: Nevermind, I got it.
20:55  Stava: dilvie, I didnt even know about that one :o
20:55  dilvie: stava: oh.
20:55  Matthijn: I wonder if it is possible to 'select' subchildren of an element using an selector? You can do this: $(obj).children('input'); which selects the input children of obj, but if they are sub-children, they are not selected, is this possible in any way? :)
20:56  ajpiano: ?find @ Matthijn
20:56 @bot-t: Matthijn, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
20:56  Matthijn: I will look into that, thanks! :)
21:01  binni: how do I make clicking a button change the theme from one to the other (from smoothness to redmond for example)?
21:03  snover: binni: There is a “disabled” property on DOM representation of <link> elements. you need to load the additional CSS you want to display as rel="alternate" and then toggle the disabled attribute on it
21:04  ajpiano: binni: you should look at the ui-themeswitcher widget, and see the techniques it's using to do what it does
21:04  binni: alrighty, thanks guys.

21:26 @bot-t: solars, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
21:28  marcamillion: say I applied 'fadeTo()' to an img/element, how do I check if it has been faded before ?
21:28  alex88: check opacity attribute
21:28  marcamillion: for instance, say I wanted to 'unFade' it
21:28  marcamillion: ahh...would that be css: opacity ?
21:28  marcamillion: that's brilliant....thnx
21:29  solars: Fernandos, Dracos not really an accordion, best example is an xml source tree, where I want to collapse/expand the indentation levels
21:30  Dracos: ?tree @ solars
21:30 @bot-t: solars, Tree Traversal - http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
21:30  Dracos: meh, that's not what you wanted
21:30  Dracos: there are tree plugins
21:31  alex88: np
21:31  Fernandos: marcamillion: there are lots of vendor specifc namings for opacity that you'd need to have it working across browsers -khtml-opacity, -moz-opacity, -o-opacity, opacity and a microsoft specific one
21:31  Dracos: http://www.jstree.com/
21:32  Dracos: marcamillion: the MS opacity property is still filter(), I think
21:33  alex88: i've tried also to use ajax and get image so it would be cached.. no way..
21:33  grundel: have no idea why this don't work in my browser... http://jsfiddle.net/grunde/pTNRR/
21:34  melignus: I'm using this tutorial right here -> http://javascript-array.com/scripts/jquery_simple_drop_down_menu/#
21:34  melignus: But for some reason my drop down is ending up side by side and I can't figure out what's going on.
21:35  ejo: wow, that's kind of funny.  some javascript for the left sidebar menus at jqueryui.com is broken :P
21:35  marcamillion: alex88: what's wrong with this syntax: if($(this).parent().parent().css({ 'opacity' < 1 })) {	alert("This image is faded"); } ?
21:35  marcamillion: I am getting an 'unexpected token <' message in my console
21:35  marcamillion: for that line
21:36  alex88: marcamillion, sure, you can't put < there.. do something like value = $(this).parent().parent().css({ 'opacity'}); if (value<1) etc etc
21:36  cohitre: grundel: what do you mean it "doesn't work"
21:36 @bot-t: (43 hours 30 mins ago) <snover> Tell cohitre May I use a wonderful cohitre for my jQuery team headshot?
21:36  cohitre: ?
21:36  solars: Dracos, thanks, I'll have a look
21:36  ajpiano: marcamillion if ($(this).parent().parent().css("opacity") < 1) { }
21:36  marcamillion: ahh...i see
21:37  melignus: No suggestions for what to look for why my drop-down menu is side by side instead of one on top of the other?
21:37  melignus: Where should I look?
21:37  Dracos: hmm, would be nice is parent() took an arg to see how far up it should go, which would default to 1
21:37  ejo: ... but only on some pages... jqueryui.com must not be making use of a good template inheritance system, or something...
21:37  grundel: cohitre, work if i load the function in firebug after loading the page
21:38  grundel: but for some reason it doesn't work just after the page loaded
21:38  ajpiano: Dracos, see ?closest

21:39  ajpiano: disaster area
21:39  ajpiano: it's more britle than ... actual delicious chocolate brittle
21:39  marcamillion: alex88: now this line is giving me an 'unexpected token }' error message in console: var img_opacity = $(this).parent().parent().css({ 'opacity' });
21:39  ajpiano: marcamillion, ffs
21:39  ajpiano: css("opacity")
21:39  alex88: remove {}
21:39  marcamillion: ok
21:39  ajpiano: when you pass css with an object, it's a setter, not a gettter.
21:39  marcamillion: ajpiano: ok.....take it easy

21:40  ajpiano: marcamillion i know you are

21:40  ajpiano: but see ?tijnh
21:40 @bot-t: This is #jquery, not #handholding.
21:40  marcamillion: heh
21:42  Ned_: Is there any way to have a jQuery object (with say 100 nodes in it), and "pop" nodes from the object ?
21:42  marcamillion: w00t w00t...this thing is coming together nicely :)
21:43  ajpiano: Ned_, you can use .slice() on a jquery object
21:43  thinkt4nk: Ned_ > see iterator design pattern
21:43  Ned_: cheers ...
21:43  Ned_: thinkt4nk: that's just in the docs somewhere ?
21:43  ajpiano: ned, use slice
21:44  Ned_: ajpiano: slice doesn't modify the original though
21:44  Ned_: and it seems rather nasty to do
21:44  Ned_: myvar = myvar.slice()
21:44  ajpiano: Ned_: nothing modifies the original on a jquery object, pretty much
21:44  Ned_: in each loop
21:44  ajpiano: Ned_, every single traversal method returns a new jquery object
21:44  Ned_: ajpiano: I guess
21:44  ajpiano: .add() returns a new jquery object
21:44  Ned_: true
21:45  Ned_: actually, the iterator isn't going to work for me
21:45  Ned_: because I want to pop stuff on-demand
21:45  Ned_: not all in a quick sequence
21:45  Ned_: ajpiano: I think I'll use slice ;-)
21:45  Ned_: ajpiano: you'd use .eq(0) and slice() ?
21:46  Ned_: to get the element, and get the rest ?
21:46  ajpiano: you don't need to use .eq at all
21:46  ajpiano: you can call slice directly on a jquery
21:46  ajpiano: object
21:46  Ned_: yes
21:46  Ned_: but the pop operation needs to be done in two steps right ?
21:46  Ned_: first I need to get the "first" item
21:46  Ned_: then I need to remove the "first" item ?
21:47  ajpiano: you want to filter shit out of the site?
21:48  Ned_: ajpiano: no
21:48  ajpiano: just do slie with two args
21:48  ajpiano: slie
21:48  ajpiano: $("div").slice(5,10)
21:48  Ned_: I don't need two args
21:48  Ned_: I can just use
21:48  ajpiano: i dno't know what you're asking anymore
21:48  ajpiano: ?xy problem
21:48 @bot-t: You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
21:48  Ned_: myvar.slice(1)
21:48  Ned_: ajpiano: I understand XY problem
21:48  Ned_: ajpiano: what I'm asking is how to "pop"
21:48  Ned_: and I have an answer now
21:48  ajpiano: ok
21:49  Ned_: :-)
21:49  ajpiano: .eq or .slice, yes.
21:49  Ned_: well, both
21:49  Ned_: it's a two step process
21:49  ajpiano: if you .eq() first..... you aren't going to have much left to slice
21:49  ajpiano: watever
21:49  Ned_: ajpiano: two separate commands
21:49  ajpiano: if you think you are good to go, then i am happy to, believe that
21:49  Ned_: var popped = myList.eq(0);
21:49  Ned_: myList = myList.slice(1);
21:50  ajpiano: Ned_, are you exepcting that .eq() wil have modified the original set?
21:50  Ned_: ajpiano: no
21:50  Ned_: ajpiano: when I say pop, I don't just want the first item removed, I also need whatever value that was
21:50  Ned_: so the first command gives me the value of the item I'm "about to pop"
21:50  Ned_: then the slice "pops it"
21:50  ajpiano: what
21:50  ajpiano: no it doesn't
21:50  ajpiano: .eq returns the element
21:50  Ned_: yes
21:51  Ned_: oh, I should use .get() ?
21:51  Ned_: wait
21:51  ajpiano: ...
21:51  Ned_: .eq() returns a jQuery object
21:51  ajpiano: right
21:51  Ned_: not the element
21:51  ajpiano: i know that.
21:51  ajpiano: i am just saying
21:51  ajpiano: when you do foo.eq(0).... you have the jquery object, you don't need to.. "pop" it anywhere
21:51  Ned_: do you know what pop is ?
21:52  Ned_: if you have an array of 10 items called "mylist"
21:52  Ned_: a = pop myList
21:52  Ned_: typically means: a == first element from the list, and myList is only 9 elements long now
21:52  ajpiano: i know what pop means in a js context, yes.
21:52  Ned_: well, pop in a js context is pop in a general programming context right ?
21:53  Ned_: Hmmm, okay, I'm doing it from the "other end" according to jQuery documentation
21:53  ajpiano: remove the last elem in the array and return it
21:53  Ned_: yes
21:53  Ned_: so it's like that, except I'm doing it from the front
21:53  Ned_: I'm removing the first element and returning it
21:53  Ned_: I guess that's "shift"
21:53  Ned_: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_shift.asp  :-)
21:53  Ned_: so I lied when I said pop
21:53  Ned_: I meant shift
21:53  ajpiano: right, and .eq is not .shift
21:54  Ned_: ajpiano: no, it's the first part of shift
21:54  Ned_: the slice is the second part
21:54  Fernandos: does someone seen a center and stretch/fit snippet or plugin?
21:54  Ned_: .eq gives me the first element, and then a subsequent .slice removes it
21:54  ajpiano: ok
21:55  ajpiano: as long as you're happy
21:55  Ned_: :-)
21:56  snover: Ned_: Do NOT link to w3schools
21:56  Ned_: snover: oh?, why's that ?
21:57  tprice: yeah why?
21:57  snover: ?w3schools @ Ned_
21:57 @bot-t: Ned_, http://oksoclap.com//whyw3schoolssucks
21:57  ajpiano: ?w3schools
21:57 @bot-t: http://oksoclap.com//whyw3schoolssucks
21:57  ajpiano: lol
21:57  ajpiano: funny that that question comes up so much on sunday
21:58  Ned_: fair call
21:58  Ned_: ajpiano: it's Monday here ;-)
21:59  tprice: why use the word "BULLSHIT" a lot dont they
22:00  snover: tprice: w3schools is a lot of bullshit.
22:00  tprice: haha yeah so does the internet
22:01  Jester831: What is the proper way to echo out a php array via $.post?
22:02  Dracos: ajpiano: that link has a double slash to start the path :)
22:02 --- Catikos is now known as Nomikos
22:02  snover: Jester831: that question makes no sense.
22:03  Ned_: are there any jQuery commands that modify the current object (rather than returning a new one) ?
22:03  snover: no.
22:03  Bartzy: How can I open a new window without URL, and inject html to it ?
22:03  Ned_: right, so nothing like pop() or shift() are every likely to exist ... ?
22:03  snover: no.
22:03  Ned_: right ... oh well
22:03  Ned_: :p
22:04  Jester831: Well, I created an array in my php file, and I can print_r it, but then the callback data has a php array, not a javascript object
22:04  ajpiano: Ned_, you could get the underlying array and call pop or shift on it
22:05  Ned_: ajpiano: it's an "object" rather than array ?
22:05  Ned_: ajpiano: it doesn't matter
22:05  RTPMatt: jester831 you are probably looking for the php fctn json_encode
22:05  Bartzy: How can I open a new window without URL, and inject html to it ?
22:05  Ned_: I'll just go with the .eq + .slice combo for now
22:05  ajpiano: var el = $("foo").get().pop()
22:05  ajpiano: Ned_, have you considered, just for a second, the notion that i actually know what i am talking about?
22:05  Jester831: Yea actually I am using json_encode instead of print_r now, but one of my messages is generated by wordpress and causes a json error
22:05  Ned_: oh, that works ?
22:06  ajpiano: yes, it does
22:06  Ned_: interesting ....
22:06  Ned_: I've considered the notion you're a tad grumpy right now ... clearly you have a better understanding of this than me :-)
22:07  Jester831: the issue is that json_encode trips up if html is in one of the objects, and print_r gives me an array instead of an object, and I need a javascript object to return values by name
22:07  Ned_: ajpiano: I'll try that out, that looks much cleaner
22:07  snover: Jester831: json_encode certainly does not give a shit if the content is html
22:07  ajpiano: it's just that, there is probably a better way of what doing what you want to do :)
22:08  Ned_: ajpiano: well, the ultimate thing I'm trying to do is:
22:08  Ned_: I have say 100 elements, and I need to make an AJAX request for each one
22:08  Ned_: but I can't just start them all at once (at least not in IE)
22:08  snover: you’re doing it wrong.
22:08  ajpiano: ok
22:08  ajpiano: yeah...already you're kinda in trouble.
22:08  Ned_: well yes, this isn't a public site, it's an internal administration interface
22:09  Ned_: that's pushing updates out to 100 servers
22:09  Ned_: it's not expected to be super-fast
22:09  Ned_: each request takes a little while to complete, and on return I update the status on the page
22:09  Ned_: to say that server i supdates
22:09  Ned_: err, is updated
22:09  Dracos: 100 ajax requests will be super slow
22:09  ajpiano: Ned_are you trying to do one after the other
22:09  Ned_: ajpiano: well, ideally say 4-5 in parallel
22:09  ajpiano: like, when one finishes, the next one starts?
22:09  Nomikos: Ned_: server-to-server might be better for that
22:09 --- boaz_ is now known as boaz
22:10  Ned_: Nomikos: yes, I've considered that, for now this basically works, and the only issue is that IE doesn't like the huge parallelism
22:10  Ned_: so I just want to cut it back to only attempted up to "n" at once
22:10  Ned_: so I figured
22:10  snover: If you’re relying on your *client* to ensure consistent data distribution to a bunch of service, you are fucking nuts
22:10  ajpiano: ?g self-executing calblack execution paul_irish @ Ned_
22:10 @bot-t: ajpiano, No results found for 'self-executing calblack execution paul_irish'.
22:10  Ned_: using the ajaxstart/stop callbacks, and just popping them off the list as requests finish
22:10  ajpiano: Ned_, however, all you need is slice for this
22:11  ajpiano: var rows = $("tr")
22:11  Ned_: snover: normally I'd agree with you, in this case it's a very controlled environment
22:11  Ned_: only 1-2 users on a very locked down network
22:11  Ned_: all local traffic
22:12  Nomikos: Give them Firefox :)
22:12  snover: doesn’t matter dude. clients crash; IE doubly so.
22:12  snover: impatient users close windows
22:12  snover: power outages occur
22:12  snover: etc.
22:12  snover: etc.
22:12  Ned_: snover: sure, and then shit doesn't happen,
22:12  snover: ?w ACID
22:12 @bot-t: snover, Acid - An acid (from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour) is a substance which reacts with a base. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid
22:12  snover: fucking bot-t
22:12  Ned_: heh
22:12  Nomikos: <3 bot-t
22:13  Ned_: snover: yes, I guess it fails there, but even on the server-side many of the problems you outline still exist
22:13  snover: In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties that guarantee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction are processed reliably. In the context of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID
22:13  Ned_: snover: I can't update 100 separate machines atomically
22:14  Ned_: even if I do it from the server-side
22:14  Nomikos: mysql replication?
22:14  Ned_: I agree that durability would be improved however
22:14  Ned_: Nomikos: except then I'd be using MySQL
22:14  Nomikos: (not that I know what I'm talking about, but it sounds good, no)
22:14  snover: Basically every database system has the ability to perform distributed updates
22:14  Nomikos: Ned_: ah. are you not using any db for this?
22:15  snover: MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Couch, Cassandra, Oracle, MSSQL
22:15  snover: pick one
22:15  Ned_: Nomikos: the remote machines are running a custom service I'm sending data to
22:15  snover: it has replication.
22:15  Ned_: I have no control over the service
22:15  Ned_: the service is a bit shit, but hey, there it is
22:15  Ned_: the client has actually pointed out they don't really care if some of the machines don't get updates
22:16  Ned_: so yes, I concede that it would definitely be more durable to do the updates from the server-side and just push progress messages back to the browser
22:16  Ned_: but there's no way I can make it atomic, and it just doesn't need to be anywya
22:16  Ned_: err, anyway
22:18  Bartzy: anyone knows Erik zaadi's PrintElement plugin ?
22:18  solars: does anyone know a plugin to create an expandable tree from an xml file? jstree needs me to convert the xml file first into its format..
22:19  Dracos: there's more than one tree plugin
22:19  Ned_: ajpiano: you were going to say how I only needed slice() ?, I'm curious to see the rest of that if you're still about ?
22:19  ahmed-tux: can jquery do same work as ajax ??
22:19  paul_irish: ?g Erik zaadi PrintElement plugin
22:19 @bot-t: paul_irish, jQuery Print Element 1.2 - Erik Zaadi @ GitHub -> Home - http://projects.erikzaadi.com/jQueryPlugins/jQuery.printElement/
22:20  Dracos: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/tree
22:20  Nomikos: ahmed-tux: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
22:20  ahmed-tux: Nomikos: thank you ,
22:21  solars: Dracos, yeah, but it seems nothing that converts an xml file into a tree view
22:23  Ned_: as an aside, if we don't use w3schools, do we have a preferred javascript reference site ?
22:24  Ned_: MDC ?
22:24  Nomikos: That's a good one
22:25  Ned_: ajpiano: .get().shift() doesn't modify the original jQuery object, but it does modify the array, so I think I'll do it that way (I assume that's what you meant?)
22:25  ajpiano: Ned_, yes, then you can $(array)
22:25  ajpiano: also i'm making a slice example
22:25  ajpiano: giv e a few mins
22:26  Ned_: ajpiano: yeah, well in this case I don't even need that ... I only need the element I shifted
22:26  Ned_: so I can just keep the array as my "state"
22:26  Nomikos: Ned_: also, this guy http://www.crockford.com/javascript/
22:26  Ned_: ajpiano: cheers
22:28  Nomikos: Curious too, what other JS references do you guys use?
22:28  Nomikos: http://www.javascriptkit.com/ ?
22:32  ajpi: Ned_: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/hWNQV/
22:32  Ned_: ta
22:33  Ned_: ajpi: Hmmm, interesting
22:33  Bartzy: Anyone knows of issues of Safari with print() ?
22:34  jigz: no
22:34  Ned_: ajpi: that's a fairly different way from what I was thinking :-)
22:36  jigz: Ned_: do each ajax call one after another using callback on success, this will take the longest, but using a parralel var (say 2, or 3 simultanious calls) and devide the callbacks up depending on what the var is.. and do browsercheck if IE parralel var = 1, else if firefox, parralel = 10 (testing of success rate of course)
22:36 --- ajpi is now known as ajpiano
22:36  ajpiano: Ned_: just food for thought :)
22:37  Ned_: jigz: err, that's kind of what I'm doing already
22:37  Ned_: jigz: which is kind of what ajpiano's exapmle is too
22:37  Ned_: err, example
22:37  Ned_: just a different pattern for doing it
22:39  jigz: Ned_: why not send a list of http requests to process to a php script, and in that script process each one server side? much easier imho
22:39  Ned_: jigz: well, for one I hate PHP ... but I imagine that's not your point ;-)
22:39  Ned_: jigz: yes, that has been suggested above
22:39  Ned_: jigz: you can read back if you want to see it all :-)
22:40  Nomikos: jigz: what an *excellent* idea ;-)
22:40  jigz: lol
22:41  Ned_: Nomikos: except for the PHP part :p
22:42  Nomikos: Ned_: it beats IE/JavaScript in this context
22:42  Ned_: I dunno
22:42  Ned_: I think I'd rather write JS than PHP
22:42  Nomikos: Any chance of serverside JS?
22:42  Ned_: nodejs is pretty awesome :p
22:43  jigz: node.js ?
22:43  Ned_: yeah
22:44  Fernandos: especially node-boilerplate if you want a quick and smooth run
22:45  k1ng__: its time to reinstall my fking os. cya
22:47  jigz: glhf
22:53  jigz: encodeURI clips hash symbol ?
22:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery -o bot-t]
22:56  jigz: encodeURI('index.php #fragment') //gives index.php%20
22:57  Nomikos: jigz: also when you do like alert(encodeURI('index.php #fragment')); ?
22:57  Nomikos: because that gives me index.php%20#fragment
22:58  tprice: js> t(encodeURI('index.php #fragment'));
22:58  jigz: encodeURI('index.php') + ' #fragment';  //works :-)
22:58  jigz: tprice: what is t();?
22:58  tprice: haha then end of alert
22:59  jigz: o heh
22:59  soee: for example: $('div#content-bottom li') can i somwhere inside use $(this) ?
23:00  Nomikos: soee: probably. pastebin example code?
23:02  soee: Nomikos: dont have yet, just want to set li width the same as img width insite it, so i want to use .each but i dont know how to ref to iage inside li
23:03  ajpiano: $("#foo li").each(function() { var $t = $(this); $t.width($t.find("img").width());  });
23:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [#jquery +o ajpiano]
23:04 --- ajpiano sets modes [#jquery +b k1ng*!*@*]
23:04  Nomikos: damnit, you beat me to it by like 5 minutes
23:04  jigz: encodeURI inside load() causes ' #fragment' to clip. that is all.
23:05  soee: ajpiano: thank you very much, works fine :)
23:06  Bartzy: How do I get the actual html of <img id="bla" />
23:06  Bartzy: I want to actually get <img id="bla" />
23:06  jigz: can anyon recommend a host for dev that will be fast both in north american and europe?
23:07  tprice: $('img')
23:07  Bartzy: no
23:07  Bartzy: I want to get the html
23:07 @ajpiano: ?g jquery outerhtml @ Bartzy
23:07  bot-t: Bartzy, .html() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/html/
23:07 @ajpiano: sonofa
23:07  tprice: $('img').thml()
23:07 @ajpiano: ?g jquery outerhtml plugin @ Bartzy
23:07  bot-t: Bartzy, My jQuery outerHTML plugin | DBJ.ORG - http://dbj.org/dbj/?p=91
23:07 @ajpiano: ^^
23:07  Bartzy: plugin ? :\
23:08  Bartzy: oh
23:08 @ajpiano: it's not a core method
23:08  Bartzy: nm. thanks ajpiano. exactly what was looking for.. as always :p
23:09  Bartzy: ajpiano: Why this is working ?
23:09  Bartzy: appending an empty div to a clone of the element ?
23:09 @ajpiano: huh
23:10  Bartzy: ?
23:11  prism: hey all is:  $('#content').css("background-image",'url("/images/world.jpg")'); correct .. do I actually need to specify url()
23:13  jigz: prism: yes
23:13  prism: cool, thank you jigz
23:13  jigz: prism: you do need to specify url
23:13  prism: got it ^_^
23:13  prism: ajpiano, can I pm you for a channel related issue
23:13 @ajpiano: ok?
23:14  prism: ta

23:25  pedramphp: toggleClass sample in jquery ui doesn work
23:25  pedramphp: !!!
23:25  pedramphp: http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggleClass/
23:25  treasonx: quick jquery mobile queston how can I clear the urlStack?
23:25 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 99 seconds
23:26  treasonx: i see its exposed right now.. but that wont be forever
23:26  pedramphp: if I want to use the toggleClass functionality is there anyway to not load jqueryUI
23:26  pedramphp: by the way I am using the toggleClass in my project it doesn't apply the animation
23:26  pedramphp: it seems like the duration feature doesn't work in it
23:27  pedramphp: any thoughts
23:27  pedramphp: ?
23:28  Guest93338: Can someone provide a recommended plugin for doing endless scroll?  I am trying to do it exactly as on decafsucks.com, with the continuous load and the "loading" popup.
23:28  RTPMatt: pedramphp: i belive toggle class is part or jquery, so you shouldnt need jquery UI to use it, only jquery
23:29  pedramphp: I am checking the jquery ocs
23:29  pedramphp: docs I dont see anything
23:29 @ajpiano: toggleClass is a ui method as well
23:29 @ajpiano: RTPMatt
23:29  pedramphp: how come it doesn't work though
23:29 @ajpiano: jquery ui lets you do class transitions
23:29 @ajpiano: pedramphp, i don't know, i let the team know that it is broken
23:29 @ajpiano: i don't know why the demos aren't working,
23:29  RTPMatt: right, but you can use toggleclass without ui
23:29  RTPMatt: right?
23:29  pedramphp: I know
23:29 @ajpiano: yes but it won't transition, RTPMatt
23:30  pedramphp: I need the transition
23:30  RTPMatt: right
23:30 @ajpiano: which is what he's trying to do
23:30  pedramphp: I don't know what to do
23:30  pedramphp: do you guys know what is the logic behind it
23:30  RTPMatt: heh, right
23:30 @ajpiano: try an older version
23:30 @ajpiano: of ui
23:30  pedramphp: so we can write the lugin
23:31  pedramphp: thanks guys
23:34  bawigga: in terms of performance what is faster? $('#id div.classname') or $('div.classname', id),  where id = $(#id)
23:34  bawigga: or do they end up being the same?

23:45  simmerz: hi. starting what is going to be a fairly complex js app and wondered what the best approach is for the following:
23:46  stuffmc: hi folks
23:46  simmerz: I have a model in the backend called Story, and I want to get the list of stories, display them on page load (using js), and then bind events and handle them. Am I best off namespacing and writing a plugin?
23:46  stuffmc: jQuery and XML :)
23:47  stuffmc: $.get - gives me a "Document" back
23:47  trend: why not a JSON file?
23:47  trend: Doc is fine though
23:47  stuffmc: because I can't choose
23:47  trend: ah ok. heh
23:48  stuffmc: so how can I at least got the string representation, or even better, parse within jQuery...
23:48  trend: I would just use delegate to bind the evts to the container, so no need to bind multiple times
23:48  stuffmc: I can use DOMParser though
23:48  trend: no plugin dev needed
23:49  trend: but if you don't use an obj literal design or some other js design structure
23:49  ahmed-tux: how to do fade without change Div size
23:49  ahmed-tux: changing
23:50  stuffmc: I'm not sure what I need to call when my "data" (in $.get) is a "Doc", to get its string representation
23:50  bp0: set dataType to 'text' in the get
23:51  bp0: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
23:51  bp0: see the dataType section
23:52  bp0: .get is a shortcut to .ajax, has a dataType param
