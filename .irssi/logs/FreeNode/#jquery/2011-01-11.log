00:00  KostasDi: ohh come on.. at least say hi
00:00  iamjarvo: KostasDi:  sorry I said hi earlier
00:01  iamjarvo: hi all
00:01  KostasDi: no.. i'm talking about my question..
00:01  timmywil: iamjarvo, which browser are you using?  you should be able to see everything in the response in the resources tab for web inspector and net->xhr in firebug
00:01  KostasDi: i don't seem to get any answers.. even greetings
00:01  nlogax: codespectator: jquery calls the function with the current element as `this`, could that be what's messing it up?
00:01  flipzagging: I'm trying to achieve this with jquery ui: create elements which are "pre-slided-up" inside another element which is already hidden
00:01  iamjarvo: timmywil: i am using firebug in the response i see the entire page though
00:02  flipzagging: however, slideUp() does nothing if the element doesn't have layout
00:02  flipzagging: and hide() isn't the right thing either, since then it won't slideDown()
00:02  flipzagging: so, in the past, I fixed this with divs that were set to height: 0;, but I'd rather not do that.
00:02  nlogax: codespectator: did you try console.log()ing it to see that it's what you want?
00:02  flipzagging: Suggestions?
00:02  codespectator: nlogax: I figured it would be something to do with the scope, but not sure how to fix it
00:03  nlogax: codespectator: in the outer scope, you can say var whatever = this: the refer to the "correct this" using that name, further down
00:03  nlogax: *then
00:03  timmywil: iamjarvo, so the response is html?
00:04  iamjarvo: timmywil: in the response tab i see an entire html page i would just like to get back the error or success messages from the php file
00:05  KostasDi: http://jsfiddle.net/v5xye/ try adding a new box. The sortable inside it does not work, even after a refresh (test it by adding a new line inside)
00:05  timmywil: iamjarvo, sounds like a php question, it will need to respond with that
00:06  g_: interesting, a php file_get_contents can pull this file ok, but a .get seems to pull the file but with an empty response
00:06  g_: though firebug is showing that the 'size' value is the same for a .get or a direct access
00:07  iamjarvo: timmywil:  well if i am doing an ajax submit how do i catch errors and success messages ?
00:08  g_: ahh, i'm trying to .get a file on a third-party server
00:10  timmywil: iamjarvo, are you just wondering how to know whether or not the ajax was successful?  There aren't any messages unless you're talking about javascript/server errors.
00:10  nlogax: there's the http status
00:11  nlogax: and callbacks for them
00:11  nlogax: other than that it's up to you
00:11  iamjarvo: timmywil:  well for example I have in my php if name is blank the error is name can't be blank. now if the user submits the form and name is blank how do i get that error to show them
00:12  gnarf: g_ you may be able to abuse yahoo pipes for that get
00:12  peter2: what would be the best way to select a child of a div that is an input, both have a class but no id
00:12  timmywil: iamjarvo, ok, php needs to send that error back to you in the response then
00:13  khurram: <a href='hello.php'> myData </a>  please tell me how can i get the value myData on click using jquery ?
00:13  iamjarvo: khurram:  you can use .load
00:13  khurram: .load will return the string myData ?
00:14  richardr: I'm having trouble selecting the checked radio button on my form with Javascript. I keep getting "undefined". http://pastie.org/private/e1qbeuqu5pvcpiq2irpota
00:14  iamjarvo: khurram:  sorry misuderstood your question thought you wanted to laod the data from hello,php
00:14  iamjarvo: you can just say this.attr('href')
00:14  khurram: no i just the want the value of <a>  not the href value but the value
00:14  timmywil: khurram: $('a').click(function () { var data = $(this).text(); //Do what i want });
00:15  khurram: oh thankx a lot
00:15  iamjarvo: timmywil:  do you have any articles that talk about php returning the value?
00:15 --- Frippe_ is now known as Frippe
00:16  timmywil: i try to steer clear of php as much as possible
00:16  timmywil: so i don't know how to do that in php
00:17  iamjarvo: timmywil: alright thanks man
00:18  SugaSlide: bleh
00:18  SugaSlide: .data() and .attr("data-sort") return undefined
00:18  g_: how do i get the error message from an ajax error handler?
00:19  timmywil: np
00:19  gnarf: richardr: is the #question-id in your search above that form?
00:19  gnarf: or did you mean #form-question-{id}
00:19  richardr: no if you scroll horizontally on pastie
00:19  richardr: you'll see fieldset id="question-{id}"
00:19  richardr: and im 100% im getting question_id, the alert comes up with the correct one
00:19  gnarf: aha
00:19  gnarf: sorry
00:20  timmywil: sugaslide, you did .data('sort')?
00:20  SugaSlide: yips
00:20  richardr: gnarf: any ideas? really having trouble with this
00:20  gnarf: you tried putting '' quotes around answer[]
00:20  timmywil: weird
00:20  gnarf: in the selector?
00:20  timmywil: your selector's wrong or something
00:20  richardr: timmywil: it looks right? :/
00:21  timmywil: i was talking to sugaslide
00:21  richardr: gnarf: i can give that a try
00:21  timmywil: or is he helping you
00:22  peter2: i can't get this to work: $(this).parent().addClass('.red');   http://jsfiddle.net/WsHWt/1/
00:22  SugaSlide: bleh
00:22  gnarf: richardr: http://www.jsfiddle.net/xXNhd/
00:23  ecto: hey all. <noob> is this an analog to $.text() for images? </noob>
00:24  peter2: nevermind i figured it out $(this).parent().addClass('redbg'); duh
00:24  ecto: or a general way i could to it
00:24  richardr: gnarf: adding '' didnt fix it around name=..
00:25  gnarf: richardr: look at the fiddle -- i get the right value
00:25  gnarf: i moved :checked to before the [name
00:25  gnarf: dunno if that made any difference
00:25  richardr: gnarf: fixed, thanks so much. :)
00:25  timmywil: ecto, what?
00:26  skyl: this still isn't fixed http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7942 : P
00:26  timmywil: skyl, that's what it's supposed to do man
00:26  SugaSlide: i dont get this :/
00:26  ecto: I'm scraping a page, pulling out content from td's. It's ugly. I need to check if there's text or an image in the cell
00:26  g_: ok, so i've found i can see data returned in firebug with datatype set to jsonp, but no callback is being fired. how do i specify a callback with josnp?
00:26  timmywil: depending on the browser
00:26  SugaSlide: ahhhhhhhhh
00:26  SugaSlide: found my problem
00:27  timmywil: jQuery can't fix that for you
00:27  skyl: j/k
00:27  SugaSlide: with drag / drop ui... when you drop an item onto a dropable how do you move the dragable to the dropable..
00:27  gnarf: g_: is the data actually JSON
00:27  SugaSlide: .appen it keeps its positioning
00:28  SugaSlide: ui.helper.appendTo(this)
00:28  peter2: skyl:  lol
00:28  SugaSlide: offsets the dragged elements position :/
00:28  g_: gnarf: no, html
00:28  gnarf: SugaSlide: ui.draggable.appendTo?
00:29  g_: gnarf: no error handler is being fired either
00:29  gnarf: g_: thats to be expected
00:29  g_: why?
00:29  gnarf: your asking for JSONP
00:29  timmywil: skyl, actually they could, but they don't want to
00:29  gnarf: but your not getting jsonp
00:29  g_: gnarf: so why wouldn't the error handler fire?
00:29  gnarf: because there is no reliable error handler for jsonp
00:29  gnarf: it either works, or doesnt
00:29  g_: oh
00:29 * SugaSlide hugs gnarf
00:30  SugaSlide: thanks
00:30  gnarf: look at yahoo pipes
00:30  skyl: I like it like that, don't have to go scuffling around in ~/Downloads or wherever
00:30  SugaSlide: the ui docs needs updating :P
00:30  g_: i haven't used pipes for about 4 yeras
00:30  SugaSlide: i was sure there was a ui.draggable but meh.. docs says there isnt
00:30  gnarf: or yql
00:30  gnarf: or
00:30  g_: ql?
00:30  gnarf: you need to write your own server side proxy
00:30  g_: ah
00:31  timmywil: skyl, that and it's hosted on their cdn, so you can include it directly from there on your pages
00:31  g_: screw it, in that case, i'll just call a php file which will get the data i want
00:31  g_: thanks anyway gnarf
00:31 * gnarf nods at g_
00:34  g_: chips. i could just murder a plate of chips now.
00:34  g_: haven't had them for about a year at least
00:34  SugaSlide: ok.. how do you disable the draggable on the thing once you dropped it?
00:37  timmywil: .undragify
00:37  timmywil: =)
00:37 --- Chainfire_ is now known as Chainfire
00:38  timmywil: don't do that, it's like .draggable('disable') or something
00:38  SugaSlide: ui.draggable.unbind("drag").appendTo(this);
00:38  SugaSlide: tho it doesnt work
00:39  SugaSlide: googleing
00:39  timmywil: .draggable('disabled', true)
00:40  timmywil: you're using jquery ui right?  or did i miss something...
00:40  SugaSlide: ye
00:40  SugaSlide: maybe i should just "build" the li again
00:41  vacho: guys..
00:41  vacho: I am running shadow box and having some issues..how can I trigger a function after shadowbox is done with it's stuff
00:42  timmywil: sugaslide: sry, it's this: .draggable( "option", "disabled", true );
00:42  SugaSlide: that gives it a class and all aswell
00:42  SugaSlide: which i dont want :/
00:42  timmywil: oh dumb
00:43  SugaSlide: ok here we go with a creating the li again :P
00:43  timmywil: er, wait, what's wrong with that?
00:43  vinay: using the jquery formwizard (http://thecodemine.org/) is there a way to branch a form, but then "rejoin" after the branch?
00:43  vinay: i.e. on the first step, i want it to branch into two directions. however, after that 2nd step (which depended on the first step), both will go through steps 3, 4, 5, 6 etc.
00:44  timmywil: make the css match and you're golden
00:44  SugaSlide: http://gyazo.com/fdf9c8a21e9c4844cdf6c6de7fcaa5ad.png
00:44  SugaSlide: after <li data-sort="7" data-f="cm" style="position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px;" class="ui-draggable ui-draggable-disabled ui-state-disabled" aria-disabled="true">Cm</li>
00:44  SugaSlide: before <li data-sort="3" data-f="datein" style="position: relative;" class="ui-draggable">Date</li>
00:44  SugaSlide: lol
00:45  timmywil: jquery ui added aria-disabled?  that's interesting
00:46  timmywil: what if i just don't want it to drag anymore but have it still be readable
00:46  timmywil: weird
00:47  SugaSlide: spam bots on the loose again
00:47  SugaSlide: :/
00:47  timmywil: yup
00:47  vacho: I am using shadowbox and I am adding a padding of 20px to the lightbox container... the problem with that is that shadowbox calculates the width of the image incorrectly. take a look here: http://screencast.com/t/kSN13Qj24C
00:48  vacho: I can reset the width using jquery, but I need something to trigger my function when shadowbox is COMPLETED

00:52  SugaSlide: solution found :D
00:52  vacho: timmywil: wont that ovveride?
00:53  timmywil: vacho, yea, do you call it a lot?
00:53  timmywil: well, should be synchronous anyway, i thought you wanted this every time you call shadowbox
00:54  timmywil: shadowbox will still do everything it did before but with the little extra you tacked on
00:55  vacho: ya thats what I want..
00:55  vacho: I want shadowbox to run one line of jquery when it's completed
00:56  KostasDi: http://jsfiddle.net/v5xye/ try adding a new box. The sortable inside it does not work, even after a refresh (test it by adding a new line inside)

01:08 * vacho slaps timmywil with a trout
01:08  timmywil: vacho: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/TCGKa/
01:09  timmywil: ha
01:09  squeek: g_: then a javascript implementation is the wrong idea, surely. gnubarcode can generate EPS formatted barcodes, is written in C so you can use the lib as an indesign extension if that's what you're shooting for. Have your extension build a frame area and fill it with the libs output.
01:09  timmywil: thx
01:09  vacho: haha sorry!
01:09  vacho: timmywil: this means I have to find the function that triggered the lightbox of shadowbox?
01:09  vacho: timmywil: meaning, the name of the function
01:10 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 97 seconds
01:10  SugaSlide: fuck i love webIDE
01:10  SugaSlide: :D
01:10  timmywil: not necessarily, shadowbox should be done with everything it does for the lightbox by the time it gets to your line of code.  So when you call $('div').shadowbox();  It will do all the lightbox creation, then run your stuff.
01:11  timmywil: now if you want to trigger something every time it opens, bind to the click that opens it.  Your function will run after the one that shadowbox has bound.
01:11  vacho: timmywil: http://pastebin.com/TM3c73GH then this should trigger the alert right?
01:12  timmywil: it should, i've never used shadowbox, this is just my best guess without going too far into it
01:13  g_: squeek: interesting
01:15  vacho: timmywil: if i bind something to it's click event it will run parallel with the shadowbox code and not afterwards.. jQuery(' #sb-nav-next').live('click', function(){ alert(4); });
01:16  vacho: timmywil: my alert appears before shadowbox has completed
01:17  timmywil: things can't run in parallel in javascript. do you bind the click before or after you call shadowbox

01:33  vacho: I wish I could animate the new width.. it looks choppy currently
01:33  coldhead: get a faster gombuter
01:33  erichynds: and use animate()
01:33  erichynds: instead of wishing css() was animate() amirite?
01:35 --- eoss_ is now known as eoss
01:36  rgoytacaz: any1 on the animation on scroll event?
01:38  slithytove2006: how can i prevent a link from carrying out its click event?
01:39  dizabled: .click( function(e){ e.preventDefault(); })
01:39  erichynds: slithytove2006, call preventDefault() on the event object you pass in
01:42  vacho: where can I find the source for shadowbox..the current one I have is minified.
01:44  slithytove2006: erichynds: like this? $('#memberNav > li.lock > a').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); return false; });
01:44  erichynds: return false is not necessary
01:44  erichynds: and is a bit redundant
01:44  jormo: suppose i want to make an element draggable on mousedown, how do i make it immediately draggable without having to first lift up the mouse and press it back down
01:45  slithytove2006: erichynds: with or without that, it still carries out the link =/
01:45  jormo: i tried o.trigger('dragstart') on it but that didn't work
01:45  snover: vacho: Out of all the viable, high-quality lightbox plugins, you picked the one that uses a proprietary license. nice!
01:45  erichynds: slithytove2006, actually in 1.4.3 you can just do .bind('click', false);
01:45  erichynds: your selector is probably wrong then
01:46  slithytove2006: well, what i actually want it to do is .show() on a different element, and then not go to the link
01:46  vacho: snover: damnit!!
01:46  slithytove2006: oh oh! sorry to bother you. i know whats wrong
01:46  vacho: snover: what does that really mean? :)
01:46  erichynds: slithytove2006, yeah, check ur selector.  make sure it's returning something.  console.log it
01:48  jormo: basically, i want the same behavior that dialogs have when you click the title bar... except i want the dialog to be non-draggable and then BECOME draggable on mousedown and instantly allow you to drag it
01:48  slithytove2006: yeah. the li isnt a direct child of #memberNav. all better now. thanks!
01:48  erichynds: isn't that typically how draggables work, jormo?
01:48  jormo: the reason is because i have a ton of elements, and i don't want all those extra jquery wrapper divs n stuff for dragging to be present
01:49  jormo: so i only want to create draggables when i really need them
01:49  jormo: namely, onmousedown
01:49  jormo: erich, no
01:49  rgoytacaz: does anyone knows how to display a div when you scroll to a certain mark ?
01:49  erichynds: so create the draggable on mousedown
01:49  jormo: i did
01:49  jormo: it doesn't become draggable until i lift up and mouse back down
01:49  erichynds: don't make me put together a test case
01:50  jormo: i even tried to do o.trigger('dragstart')
01:50  jormo: on mousedown
01:50  erichynds: are you talking native drag or jquery ui drag?
01:50  ejo: could you simulate a second mousedown?
01:50  jormo: not sure, didn't try
01:50  jormo: it's a jquery draggable
01:50 --- EoN` is now known as EoN
01:51  jormo: native
01:51  ejo: I'm not sure if it's possible, but if you could emit a second mousedown at the same coordinates as the original one, after creating the draggable... and might also have to stop propagation on the original mousedown etc.
01:52  jormo: another option is to create the draggable on mouseenter and then remove it on mouseleave
01:52  jormo: but i really don't want to resort to that
01:53  jormo: that way, by the time the mousedown happens, the draggable already exists
01:53  ejo: Perhaps you could instead, as a different approach, do some delegation magic.  Such as make a larger element containing all of your potential-draggables be the draggable, but make sure that only the smaller element in which the click-drag occurred is shown during the drag.
01:54  ejo: that way you'd only have one draggable for many elements.  But it would be more complicated code, figuring out behavior based on click location etc.  No fun.
01:54  jormo: hmm
01:55  ejo: but at that point you'd probably want to write a "delegating draggable" plugin from scratch rather than try to reuse the regular one :P
01:57  erichynds: i don't understand why you just don't make it draggable on mousedown
01:57  jormo: i did
01:58  jormo: but by that time, it's too late and it doesn't get the mousedown/click until i release and re-click
01:58  ejo: hmm
01:59  erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/NWCas/1/  that is working fine for me
01:59  erichynds: it instantly drags
01:59  ejo: could this be related to propagation?
01:59  jormo: i'm not using a dialog
01:59  jormo: i don't know if that behaves differently
02:00  erichynds: oh, thought you said a dialog.
02:00  erichynds: HOLD PLZ
02:00  erichynds: ok, now i see it
02:02  jormo: with a good solution hopefully :P

02:08  bot-t: vacho, There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
02:15  jormo: erichynds, can you explain really quick what the .data('draggable') does?  from the documentation, i thought .data() was just to add arbitrary user data to an object
02:16  erichynds: so when you call draggable(), it creates a new draggable object and stores it in the $.data of the element
02:16  erichynds: so .data('draggable') grabs that object out of the elems data cache
02:16  erichynds: within that object exists a method called _mouseDown which is called programatically
02:16  SugaSlide: in regex how would i select all "<th>client</th>"? basicaly im looking for a <th>*</th>
02:16  SugaSlide: ?
02:17  jormo: ah, so it was just shorthand?  i couold've just done:  var o = d.draggable(); o._mouseDown(e);
02:17  jormo: ?
02:18  erichynds: negative
02:18  erichynds: draggable doesn't return its own object
02:18  jormo: ah
02:18  erichynds: it returns the d element so you can chain it
02:18  jormo: i understand
02:18  erichynds: console.log() the data.('draggable') call
02:19  erichynds: you'll see a big ass object with a bunch of methods
02:19  jormo: does this work with all types of objects?  like if i do .data('nameOfTheFunction') that will give me back the created instance of the object all the time?
02:19  charnel: how can I submit a form without page refresh via jQuery  ?
02:20  erichynds: jormo, no, only with jquery ui widgets.  or anything on the widget factory, really
02:20  jormo: ah, ok
02:20  erichynds: some plugin developers do put the object in the data, but you can't rely on it
02:29  thatryan: hey guys, i have a vertical menu that hides its kids until on click it shows them, but does not work right, need to return false to prevent initial click, but then children clicks dont work... http://pastie.textmate.org/1447042  help? :
02:29  thatryan: :)
02:29  agronholm: hi, is this the right place to ask questions about jqgrid?
02:30  agronholm: or does it have a separate channel
02:30  paul_irish: wat
02:31  war10ck_ti: jquery save my life!!
02:31  khurram: why i keep receiving the errror a.cluetip is not a function when i have included both the cluetip.js as well as the css of the clue tip ?
02:31  erichynds: thatryan, i'm not sure why you're returning false there
02:31  coldhead: awesome war10ck_ti
02:31  war10ck_ti: whos admin?
02:31  khurram: does any body tried cluetip ? please help ?
02:32  coldhead: ?p @ khurram
02:32  bot-t: khurram, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
02:32  coldhead: it definitely can work, you're probably doing something wrong
02:32  thatryan: erichynds: too stop the first link from navigating the page
02:32  erichynds: thatryan, what does ur DOM look like?
02:32  coldhead: war10ck_ti: bot-t is an admin
02:33  coldhead: ask here agronholm
02:33  war10ck_ti: my conection is fail..
02:33  paul_irish: thatryan: dunno but i would put the logic into the JS.
02:33  paul_irish: and make a fiddle
02:33  war10ck_ti: i'm back tomorow...
02:33  paul_irish: OH.
02:33  khurram: http://jsfiddle.net/5MJQE/
02:33  erichynds: war10ck_ti, we'll be waiting <3
02:33  paul_irish: you want closest() not find() .. right?? maybe not
02:33  khurram: coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/5MJQE/
02:33  agronholm: if I add captions to the buttons in jqgrid's pager, they are printed outside of the button area
02:34  agronholm: so the captions and button icons overlap
02:34  agronholm: anyone know why, or how to fix it?
02:34  khurram: i have not written any thing yet its just the example code from cluetip
02:34  thatryan: paul_irish: perhaps those two confuse me. but it does work, slides as it should.
02:34  agronholm: I don't recall seeing any jqgrid example with custom buttons with captions
02:35  agronholm: if I just use the default buttons and add captions to them, captions don't overlap but the button areas aren't what they are supposed to be
02:35  thatryan: erichynds: what do you mean.
02:35  coldhead: khurram: do you have a live demo? or the rest of your code? there's nothing wrong with this
02:35  coldhead: maybe in your html
02:35  coldhead: <script> etc
02:36  khurram: do u want me to paste the complete file
02:36  coldhead: yes please
02:36  khurram: ok
02:36  thatryan: alrighty an excuse to finally make a fiddle ;)
02:38  erichynds: thatryan, change your selector to #spliiter > li
02:39  coldhead: khurram: http://jsfiddle.net/5MJQE/4/
02:39  coldhead: when i actually include cluetip and jQuery it works happily
02:39  thatryan: erichynds: lol that makes clicking any link close the accordion
02:39  erichynds: thatryan, or bind the click event to the links themselves
02:39  khurram: then what am i doing wrong ?
02:39  erichynds: instead of the li
02:40  erichynds: or paste a damn DOM structure so i can stop guessing :)
02:40  coldhead: khurram: check firebug/web inspector
02:40  coldhead: ensure you're not getting a 404 for cluetip
02:40  coldhead: ensure you don't see any syntax error
02:40  coldhead: s
02:40  khurram: Error: $("a.title").cluetip is not a function Source File: http://webdev.anl.com.au:8050/~ijazk/public_website_v4/?quick_search_input=Enter+container+number&submit=View Line: 12
02:41  rgoytacaz: Does any1 know how to do an animation that procs of the scroll down event on a page?
02:41  coldhead: khurram: that sounds like cluetip might not actually be reaching your browser
02:42  khurram: hmm so what is the solution
02:42  coldhead: first identify the problem
02:43  coldhead: do you have firebug or web inspector?
02:43  khurram: i think the security issue
02:43  khurram: yes
02:43  coldhead: check in the scripts tab to make sure it's there
02:43  coldhead: that it's not a 404
02:43  khurram: its there in the fire bug included in my page
02:43  coldhead: try hotlinking to the file on github like i did in the jsfiddle above
02:44  coldhead: and failing that, paste all your code
02:45  agronholm: anyone here using jqgrid? I asked a question about button captions a while ago
02:45  Thomas`-: Hi guys. my click even such as $('.my-class').click(function(e) {   wont register after i dynamically copy html between elemements.  any idea how i could make this trigger on the newly copied html?
02:45  rgoytacaz: Thomas`-: use .live
02:45  rgoytacaz: to register the event
02:45  coldhead: khurram: a working demo of your code would be the best thing
02:46  rgoytacaz: it will re-apply the bind to the new element when its added
02:46  rgoytacaz: no one answers my question, not nice.
02:46  Thomas`-: rgoytacaz, thanks! i will read about .live
02:46  Thomas`-: rgoytacaz, what was your question.. sorry im a noob i prob couldn't help you
02:47  rgoytacaz: I'm trying an animation that will happen after you scrolldown the page to a certain mark.
02:47  rgoytacaz: I saw it on here http://www.globo.com, but I don't know how to describe it
02:48  rgoytacaz: so I don't know what to ask.
02:50  erichynds: rgoytacaz, i would start by binding to the scroll event and using viewport selectors to see if the element is in view.  if so, animate
02:50  erichynds: ?jqueyr viewport selectors
02:50  bot-t: erichynds, Viewport Selectors | jQuery Plugins - Viewport ads couple of extra selectors to jQuery. With these selectors you can check whether element is inside or outside of viewport. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/viewport
02:52  rgoytacaz: erichynds: so its not something simple that a plugins can make for you :(
02:52  erichynds: there might be a plugin out there
02:53  felixjet: how i can append before all other elements?
02:53  erichynds: prepend() !
02:54  felixjet: like, <div>appendhere<span></span>
02:54  felixjet: thanks!
02:55  corinx: is correct ?  $(location).href = "url" ?
02:56  felixjet: corinx $('#whatever').attr('href', 'url');
02:56  erichynds: corinx just location.href = "url"
02:57  corinx: thanks
03:00  rgoytacaz: erichynds: is there a way to relate events to pixels or something like that?
03:01  gnarf: rgoytacaz: what do you mean?  e.pageX / e.pageY type styff?
03:01  gnarf: console.dir(e) an event, there are a lot of things hiding on that event
03:01  gnarf: ?event object

04:06  coldhead: draginx: your code is quite gomblex :S
04:06  coldhead: i don't get this avatar_lock and doTimeout stuff
04:07  coldhead: draginx: is the lock meant to prevent multiple simultaneous AJAX requests?
04:07  draginx: coldhead: it's for gui usability
04:07  draginx: no it's meant so that the FIRST time they ever hover
04:07  draginx: it takes 1 second to load before firing off
04:08  NoMeStay: can someone help me, im trying to do a basic slide toggle with slider retracting to a certain height
04:08  draginx: then starts a timer for 1 second if they hover over anything within that second (names are real close together) its 0 seconds
04:08  draginx: but after that 1 second is up they go back to the 1 second delay
04:08  coldhead: gomblex
04:09  draginx: yup
04:09  draginx: but the weird thing is..
04:09  draginx: the return false actually executes when its suppose to
04:09  draginx: but it still re-draws the draw_avatar block

04:09  coldhead: which return false?
04:10  draginx: the first one...

04:21  draginx: coldhead: alright thanks :)
04:21  javajosh: Akufen: hmm it works without authentication...
04:23  Akufen: javajosh looks like I might be mistaking from looking at the jquery api page
04:24  Akufen: ah yea, I had $.get in mind: "Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol."
04:25 --- joe_alman is now known as ben_alman
04:26  Akufen: anyway, care to bin your attempt?
04:27  javajosh: "Some types of Ajax requests, such as JSONP and cross-domain GET requests, do not use XHR"
04:27  javajosh: haha
04:27  javajosh: That would explain why i'm not able to set headers
04:28  Akufen: does the Calendar API require you to set them?

04:44  coldhead: depends on the modification, friend

04:44  NoMeStay: thanks!
04:44  skomorokh: I want to use jQuery BBQ with Drupal 6's stock ancient jQuery 1.2.6. The only 1.3+ function it wants is isArray(). I tried adding it thusly and it seems to work: if (!$.isArray) $.isArray = function( obj ) {...
04:46  Figaroo: How can I know if there is there is more vertical scroll left over on an element?
04:46  Figaroo: ya know
04:46  gnarf: NoMeStay: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/9Y7U7/ something like that?
04:48  skomorokh: coldhead: So my modification is tacking on a function. But I know jQuery does all sorts of cool tricks with function prototypes and suchnot and just wanted to check if this is going to bite me in the ass some subtle way next week.
04:48  skomorokh: Or not so subtle for that matter.
04:50  coldhead: skomorokh: it's pretty well behaved and tries not to ruin things for other people UNLIKE SOME OTHER LIBS
04:50  coldhead: its mostly adding extra stuff you can use, rather than changing underlying things
04:50  gnarf: Figaroo: compare scrollTop with scrollHeight?
04:51  coldhead: you just want to avoid replacing a jquery function with something less good

04:54  Aliv3: what do you mean when your slacking
04:54  gnarf: Aliv3: to prevent the default, and stop event propagation
04:54  skione: gnarf thanks, that is pretty much what I have, so the problem must be elsewhere, do I need the return false?
04:54  skomorokh: Aliv3: I mean, my gf notices if I just click for too long I'm probably on reddit and if I'm typing too much I'm wasting time on irc instead of coding.
04:54  gnarf: skione: return false will event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
04:55  gnarf: not needed in all cases
04:55  Aliv3: can jquery even take access to your keyboard/mouse? isnt it just web?
04:55  skomorokh: Aliv3: I bet you could train some machine learning with that input and get a scarily accurate system.
04:55  Aliv3: idk how to do that lol'

06:01  p4km4n: How do I stop this? Is there like a .delegate(), but for variables?
06:01  mthorn: I'm trying to build a simple date picker and I'm 99% there, but I've got one niggling bug. Once the picker is visible, if the user scrolls the page or div, the picker doesn't change positions. Is there an easy way with jquery to make one element change positions relative to another automatically?
06:02  coldhead: can't you people fix your own problems for once?
06:02  coldhead: sheesh
06:02  sdwrage: Is there a way to create an event handler that will trigger if a said object calls a particular method?
06:03  sdwrage: I need this for html5uploader and I am using jquery to do an ajax call to replace content of a div if a particular method has been called.
06:03  p4km4n: I've fixed most of my own problems, it's just no one has been able to answer this one.
06:04  coldhead: i was kidding
06:04  coldhead: i'm having a little trouble understanding your code, p4km4n
06:04  coldhead: it looks interesting though
06:04  coldhead: what is the symptom you're trying to fix?
06:05  coldhead: ?unique id
06:05  bot-t: An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
06:05  coldhead: p4km4n: ^^ you can't have more than one id="number"
06:06  p4km4n: haha.
06:06  p4km4n: really? It was actually working quite well except for that.
06:07  coldhead: mthorn: you should  try to do your positioning with CSS and leave jQuery out of it
06:07  bot-t: (1 min 9 secs ago) <dytrivedi> tell coldhead same old same old.
06:07  p4km4n: coldhead, this is actually code for this project, vapor.ne8us.com/music/
06:07  coldhead: position:relative and such
06:07  p4km4n: Check it out, it's pretty nice.
06:08  coldhead: ah neat
06:08  coldhead: IT HAS THE SAFETY DANCE
06:08  p4km4n: Hahaha, most definitely.
06:12  p4km4n: How would I pick the first element of class "song"?
06:12  coldhead: :first
06:12  coldhead: $('.song:first') sorry
06:12  p4km4n: mmk.
06:12  p4km4n: yeah, I got that, thanks coldhead.
06:12  coldhead: or $('.song:nth(1)')
06:12  coldhead: or maybe that should be nth(0)
06:13  coldhead: it's my first day using jQuery
06:13  p4km4n: really?
06:13  p4km4n: nice.
06:14  wunderkin: he's in the accelerated class
06:14  coldhead: i wish

06:17  khurram: stuck in event bubbling please help i have check boxes comming through ajax and i want to attach onClick event on them but
06:17  p4km4n: but what?
06:17  khurram: every thime i click a check box it automatically checks the top one by it self
06:18  p4km4n: code?
06:18  p4km4n: also, coldhead, you still there?
06:18  khurram: yes where sholud i paste it
06:18  p4km4n: http://pastebin.com
06:18  p4km4n: use jquery syntax highlighting, if they offer it, if not, use javascript syntax highlighting.
06:18  p4km4n: Anyways, you there coldhead?
06:19  coldhead: p4km4n: somewhat
06:19  p4km4n: haha.
06:19  p4km4n: ok, so I fixed that, but now I can address my main problem.
06:20  khurram: http://pastebin.com/Adv6vpPc
06:20  p4km4n: when I click shuffle, I can't figure out a way to keep the currNum still highlighted.
06:20  coldhead: link p4km4n?
06:20  p4km4n: coldhead: http://vapor.ne8us.com/jquery/
06:21  coldhead: khurram: http://pastebin.com/GAxvgrn9
06:21  coldhead: maybe you want something more like that?
06:22  coldhead: p4km4n: when you reload those entries via ajax you do indeed lose the reference to the original
06:23  khurram: it is same
06:23  coldhead: because it's no longer in the dom
06:23  p4km4n: I figured as much.
06:23  khurram: how should it be done
06:23  coldhead: khurram: try :selected instead of .attr('selected')
06:23  p4km4n: How would I try to counteract that?
06:23  khurram: ok
06:23  coldhead: p4km4n: you can either NOT replace the elements, and some how get a new order back from the server
06:23  coldhead: or you can give every element a unique ID
06:24  coldhead: save it, insert the new stuff, select via that ID and colourise
06:24  coldhead: or you could use ?:contains
06:24  bot-t: :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
06:24  p4km4n: eh.
06:24  coldhead: and select via the actual track name
06:24  p4km4n: That might work.
06:24  coldhead: if you have it handy
06:25  p4km4n: well, actually, the track name, in the actual music player example, would just be source.html();
06:25  coldhead: or you could get the server to keep track of it, and give class="current" to the appropriate one
06:25  coldhead: right, if you have the track name anyway that's pretty simple
06:25  p4km4n: wait.
06:25  p4km4n: server.
06:25  coldhead: it's a slow operation but you're not doing millions of times a second
06:26  p4km4n: that's a better idea, when I call the shuffle, I can check if currSong is defined.
06:26  p4km4n: or rather, if source is defined, if it is, I can pass the name of the song onto the php function, and give that element a particular id.
06:27  coldhead: neat!
06:28  p4km4n: coldhead, I still don't like it though, it's not slick and smooth like it should be, I suppose I could do it, but if I could find some way to just smoothly reconnect the dom..
06:28  p4km4n: Or stack the dom.
06:29  coldhead: p4km4n: the Right way to do it would be not to remove the dom elements but just reorder them
06:29  p4km4n: how would I do that?
06:29  p4km4n: oh, actually move the elements?
06:29  p4km4n: no ajax?
06:29  coldhead: yup
06:29  coldhead: well you might still get the actual order from the server
06:29  coldhead: but if you can do without <3
06:30  coldhead: dom injections are expensive
06:30  coldhead: p4km4n: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/shuffling-the-dom/
06:30  hn: hi i am using jquery form to submit some data through the ajaxSubmit() but it is not going into the the jquery script at all
06:30  coldhead: god bless james padolsey
06:30  hn: it is not showing any errors also
06:30  coldhead: ?p @ hn
06:30  bot-t: hn, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ . If that is down then you may use: http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org/
06:34  hn: http://pastie.org/1447433 this is the piece of code i have
06:35  hn: please look i nto it
06:35  hn: i have a form and ajaxSubmit function
06:36  coldhead: hn: is there some reason you're using ajaxSubmit instead of ajaxForm ?
06:37  khurram: why the other checks boxes are getting auto clicked ? how can i stop this event bubbling in jquery ?
06:37  coldhead: khurram: i don't think that's event bubbling, i think it's overselecting
06:37  coldhead: paste your current code please?
06:37  hn: coldhead, no there is no any specific reason for it i tried both both were not working
06:38  coldhead: hn: i prefer ajaxForm because it's the laziest
06:38  hn: coldhead, wat is the major difference between the ajaxSubmit and ajaxForm
06:38  hn: ??
06:38  coldhead: ajaxSubmit lets the programmer submit the form when they want to
06:38  coldhead: ajaxForm automatically converts a regular form to an ajax form
06:38  coldhead: you don't have to do anything else
06:39  coldhead: it handles the submit etc
06:39  khurram: coldhead: http://pastie.org/1447439
06:39  hn: if we use ajaxForm we an pass the extra parameters to post method rite other than request ??
06:39  coldhead: probably
06:39  coldhead: but that is a good reason to use ajaxSubmit instead
06:39  coldhead: if you need fancy stuff
06:40  hn: hey thanks for the inputs will try for it
06:40  hn: thanks al ot
06:41  coldhead: khurram: its not clear what $(this) will refer to on line 7
06:41  p4km4n: coldhead, you seem like you might have been doing this for a little more than one day.
06:42  coldhead: it's been a long day
06:42  coldhead: ME SO SWEEPY
06:42  khurram: this referes to checkbox
06:42  coldhead: khurram: so it does, i am sorry
06:43  coldhead: khurram: what is the function on lines 5 - 10 supposed to do?
06:43  khurram: it does show the correct contents as well all the problem is auto matic selecting of the top level check box when i select any from the botttom
06:43  p4km4n: coldhead, if you could give my code a good looking at before going to bed, that'd be exquisite. http://vapor.ne8us.com/jquery/
06:44  khurram: the last statement for function die i just put it to stop the event bubbling but some how it does n't even die
06:44  coldhead: khurram: does die() work with click() ? should you replace click with .live('click') ?
06:44  khurram: and the other two lines above it are simply showing the value of the name attribute which i want to grasp the contents of the row
06:44  coldhead: and should you replace $('.sd_checkbox').die('click'); with $(this).die('click') ?
06:45  khurram: of course i should do this
06:45  wookiehangover: hey gang
06:45  wookiehangover: whats the best way to get the difference between 2 arrays?
06:45  coldhead: thank god wookiehangover is here. khurram needs help from someone actually competent
06:45  khurram: but still not working
06:45  coldhead: wookiehangover: i believe underscore.js has a good array_diff method
06:46  wookiehangover: coldhead, that's what I though too
06:46  wookiehangover: but it doesn't appear to
06:46  khurram: wookiehangover: here
06:46  coldhead: khurram: try useing $(this) and .live() instead of .click()
06:46  khurram: on which line ?
06:46  p4km4n: wookie, could I have bit of help with my code?
06:47  wookiehangover: ya where at
06:47  p4km4n: http://vapor.ne8us.com/jquery/
06:47  wookiehangover: k.... is there a question coming?
06:47  p4km4n: When I click shuffle, it shuffles it, but then the next functionality becomes toast.
06:48  khurram: still not working
06:48  khurram: yes
06:48  wookiehangover: p4km4n:  next seems to work if you click on one first
06:48  khurram: http://pastie.org/1447439
06:48  khurram: wookiehangover: http://pastie.org/1447439
06:48  wookiehangover: p4km4n: maybe trigger('click') the first element after you shuffle
06:49  p4km4n: What if it were important to keep the current element?
06:49  coldhead: wookiehangover: var intersect = _.intersect(arrA, arrb); var diff = _.without(_.flatten([arrA, arrB]), intersect)
06:49  coldhead: my set theory is so rusty
06:49  coldhead: THANKS FOR MAKING ME FEEL BAD WOOKIEHANGOVER
06:49  wookiehangover: coldhead you genius
06:49  wookiehangover: I new there was a way to do it with flatten
06:50  coldhead: there's surely a more elegant way
06:50  p4km4n: and also, coldhead, it appears that the fix still somehow screws with the DOM.
06:51  wookiehangover: I was already looping through the array once, so I merge sorted then. but it was a time when I was like "I bet someone on #jquery would know"
06:51  p4km4n: or my next function is messed up, and I don't think it is.
06:51  Figaroo: $elem.scrollHeight exists?
06:51  coldhead: p4km4n: and you're using delegate, huh. hmm
06:51  wookiehangover: p4km4n: the next function seems to work only once it's got a target element selected
06:52  p4km4n: coldhead, yeah, I'm using delegate because initially I couldn't use the click listener on newly drawn in elements. Is that fine?
06:53  wookiehangover: khurram: you're making an implicit global by not declaring checkData with var
06:53  p4km4n: wookiehangover, it does, if you click an number element, click shuffle, you should still see....
06:53  p4km4n: I'm an idiot.
06:53  p4km4n: wookiehangover, I was misinterpreting the css highlighting I was doing for the element actually being selected.
06:54  khurram: checkdata is  declared globally on the top of the script i dint copy and pasted taht
06:54  p4km4n: wookiehangover, why does my currNum become disconnected from the DOM?
06:54  wookiehangover: khurram: gotcha
06:54  khurram: yep
06:55  NoMeStay: cam someone take a quick look at my code im trying to do height by the height of the div and for some reason its not returning the height, im pretty sure im doing it correctly
06:55  letterpress: will a $.post return html with  <script> tags stripped out?
06:55  NoMeStay: http://pastebin.com/iEJPXbUG
06:55  coldhead: letterpress: yes
06:55  coldhead: for your safety
06:56  coldhead: p4km4n: delegate is why it SHOULD work. and why i can't say "oh just use delegate, that'll fix it"
06:56  imakewebthings: NoMeStay, any reason you're doing the height call outside of domready?
06:56  NoMeStay: because it doesnt work with it inside
06:56  letterpress: coldhead: thanks. ah ok, what i'm trying to return is a js object, can i load that any other way with ajax?
06:57  coldhead: ?json @ letterpress
06:57  bot-t: letterpress, jQuery.getJSON() - Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
06:57  wookiehangover: p4km4n: so it will probably be easier to do what you're doing with a class
06:57  coldhead: that's good for data
06:57  NoMeStay: ive tried to move it inside and outside of it and its just not returning the height
06:57  wookiehangover: that way it's tied to the dom implicitly
06:57  coldhead: if you need to get functions, you need .getScript
06:57  imakewebthings: nomestay, yea have you tried on load?
06:57  p4km4n: wookiehangover: what do you mean?
06:57  imakewebthings: nomestay heights are usually not able to calc or are incorrect until all resources, css and images, are loaded
06:58  letterpress: cool thanks. no functions thankfully
06:58  wookiehangover: p4km4n: $('.number:first').addClass('current'); $('current').removeClass('current').next().addClass('current')
06:58  NoMeStay: so what would be the correct way to do that im kinda new at jquery
06:58  wookiehangover: I mean there's nothing wrong with the way you're doing it now
06:59  wookiehangover: but it may make life easier to toss a class on the one you have selected, and then tranverse ahead based on that
06:59  imakewebthings: hmmm lets see if i get this right
06:59  imakewebthings: ?load-event @ nomestay
06:59  bot-t: nomestay, .load() - Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

07:08  NoMeStay: the height isnt coming back at all lol
07:08  NoMeStay: and thats with it inside the dom
07:08  letterpress: so the js object that i'm trying to get with ajax is generated from a smarty template. so not sure how i'd return json...
07:08  imakewebthings: nomestay: i just told you, height will NOT come back correctly within domready
07:09  imakewebthings: nomestay: it needs to be within load
07:09  devdrinker: is there a way to attach information to an event, in one delegate binding I do e.formSubmitted = true, but a container similar delegate fires, but e.formSubmitted is undefined

07:12  devdrinker: but the inner and outer fire but setting a property on the event from the inner doesnt seem to show on the outer
07:12  wookiehangover: devdrinker: so you can pass an option eventData object as the 3rd argument?

09:23  mymine: how to do it? since i want to use fancybox from select option
09:23  sean`: phrearch, ?
09:23  phrearch: mymine: i dont think a regular select box allows links
09:23  sean`: give me a pracical example

09:26  askhader: Ah interesting
09:26  sean`: $('div.class').bind('click', function(){ this.id });
09:26  phrearch: when the keydown event fires, i should probably check for a keyup event where the undo is exited
09:26  sean`: or $('div.class').bind('click', function(){ var $this = $(this); $this.attr ('id') });

09:30  phrearch: $('#myselectbox').change(
09:30  phrearch: and then window.open something
09:31  mymine: hmm..
09:31  phrearch: the select options take a value parameter in which you can stuff the url
09:31  mymine: popup using fancybox is trigger by clicking href..
09:32  phrearch: well, if you want to open a window after selecting an option, then this is probably the fastest way to do it

09:51  Derppy: The transition itself should work fine, since using :hover pseudo-class to apply the new properties works fine. But not adding a class with the new properties.
09:53  Derppy: Do the browsers even launch transitions if something changes via js? Or do I need to trigger it manually somehow.

10:03  JKarsrud: yeah, 1.5hrs here, not the greatest feeling :P
10:04  Derppy: Gah, is there a way to force an element redraw or something? New element won't do a transition when I apply a class with new properties to it via addClass()
10:04  crab: askhader: if it has an #id, just select it by the id.
10:04  doonie: blackspotwiggins didn't you work from home
10:04  askhader: Hm probably right
10:04  blackspotwiggins: doonie, no
10:04  blackspotwiggins: well sometimes
10:04  blackspotwiggins: not right now
10:04  JKarsrud: ahh, did the input have an id? Then definitely select just that
10:04  crab: askhader: or if it doesn't (why not?) but the position wrt. the div is fixed, you could use $('#divid').children().first() or whatever to get to the input element
10:05  doonie: sometimes is nice
10:05  crab: see the "traversing" functions in the api documentation
10:05  JKarsrud: askhader: what does your markup look like?

10:06  askhader: JKarsrud: Thanks, I think I've got it
10:09  Derppy: To answer my own question: You need to force a redraw if you create a new element and want a css transition to happen when adding a new class to it. $(this).width() seems to do the trick.
10:10  JKarsrud: askhader: Good
10:14  mymine: finally done :)
10:16  Altreus: Can anyone recommend to me a lightbox/overlay plugin that isn't initialised in some $('trigger').overlay() way? All the ones I can find are set up by attaching them to <a> tags, and I want one I can open and close arbitrarily with Javascript
10:16  Altreus: I want to basically do $('div.overlay').overlay instead of $('a[rel]').overlay
10:16  Derppy: And now I ran into a new problem. Might be more about js generally than jquery, but how can I tell if a css-transition has completed? Do I need to create an interval relative to the element's transition-duration property and assume it went right, or is there a better way?

10:18  Altreus: JKarsrud: Tools Overlay was what was annoying me ._. binds to an anchor
10:18  markj: use colorbox
10:19  Altreus: dialog might be what I need
10:19  JKarsrud: Altreus: no it doesn't?
10:19  JKarsrud: Just in a basic example, but you can bind it to whatever
10:19  Altreus: oh hmm
10:19  Altreus: can you
10:19  Altreus: The first line of the documentation says it binds to the trigger
10:19  JKarsrud: But if UI dialog works for you, then great! :)
10:19  Altreus: I didn't look any further -_- I've tried reading Tools documentation before

10:22  JKarsrud: Altreus: yeah, then I'd stick to that

10:33  JKarsrud: double .net all the way :P
10:33  sean`: mekwall, do tell
10:33  sean`: JKarsrud, I need a mail script for asp.net
10:33  doonie: did you spit on him like i told ya!
10:33  mekwall: not much to tell :P
10:33  doonie: that earns respect
10:34  mekwall: i more or less told him that his company is crap
10:34  coldhead: don't listen to him! he's mad!
10:34  sean`: I'm sending from (name, email), to (name, email) and msg - it's a tell a friend)
10:34  mekwall: :D
10:34  sean`: mekwall, join the club
10:34  doonie: uuuuuuuuuuu
10:34  sean`: doonie, I have my conv today
10:34  sean`: in 2 hours
10:34  blackspotwiggins: mekwall used a small knife to carve "more money, bitch" in mirror image to the bottom of his shoe, went to bosses office and kicked him in the face saying "look in the mirror"
10:34  mekwall: coldhead: talking to yourself again?
10:34  doonie: finally, what happened in friday :P
10:35  mekwall: blackspotwiggins: oh, that I did half a year ago
10:35  JKarsrud: mekwall: That article you linked to wasn't very impressive. Thought it'd be a plugin :P
10:35 --- ZombieDan is now known as ShinDan
10:35  mekwall: JKarsrud: oh, no idea
10:35  mekwall: didn't check it ou lol
10:35  mekwall: out*
10:35  Kasreyn: anyone else get visual bugs in the themeswitcher widget on this page? http://brn.ath.cx/test/test.html
10:35  mekwall: sometimes I just link stuff that sounds interestning ;)
10:35  JKarsrud: mekwall: Well, it wasn't :P
10:36  mekwall: JKarsrud: too bad you can't edit tweets :(
10:36  sean`: JKarsrud, ?
10:36  JKarsrud: you can delete them ;)
10:36  mekwall: yes but that's not the same
10:36  mekwall: for example, I usually forget to add tags
10:36  Kasreyn: even delete is questionable in some cases
10:37  mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/ZxkuX/5/ <-- isn't that a bit like hoverintent?
10:37  JKarsrud: sean`: You have the System.Web.Mail namespace you could use. I know there's an SmtpMail object in there you can use
10:37  sean`: eah
10:37  JKarsrud: ++
10:37  sean`: but do you have o set up web.config with smtp?
10:37  JKarsrud: yeah
10:38  JKarsrud: this might be a help: http://www.systemwebmail.com/
10:38  sean`: can't you do like, just hotsname = localhost
10:38  sean`: and nothing else
10:39  JKarsrud: Maybe, I don't really remember. We have all sorts of wrappers around it, and have preconfigured web.config for our projects, so I'm not really sure
10:40  Altreus: Can someone help my brain work? I can't figure out how to load an external page into an iframe, using javascript, if I have to be able to send data to that page. I can't use a GET string because there's too much data :(
10:40  doonie: mekwall iz they gonna fire ya
10:40  Altreus: It needs to be an iframe because it's a dialogue box with several steps
10:40  mekwall: doonie: no... they can't
10:40  squeek: Altreus: use a form with a target to the iframe's name
10:41  doonie: will you try to find something else?
10:41  mekwall: doonie: they need me, secondly they can't just fire me :)
10:41  sean`: JKarsrud, can you look at one of those web.config?
10:41  JKarsrud: sure
10:41  mekwall: doonie: always looking for something else
10:41  doonie: I would if you talked bad about my compand ;D
10:41  Altreus: squeek: Hmm let me try this!
10:41  doonie: easy to find a substitute
10:41  sean`: If I'm asking too much lemme know, 'cuz otherwhise I'll scoure the webternet
10:41  SugaSlide: :D
10:41  mekwall: doonie: I'm underpaid, working my ass off extra hours that I don't get paid for etc.
10:42  doonie: SugaSlide would do it for half your pay!
10:42  SugaSlide: rofl
10:42  SugaSlide: i would do it for a 10th of his pay
10:42  mekwall: shush
10:42  doonie: heeh
10:42  sean`:  mekwall you'd find it amusig how many people are in your situation
10:42  mekwall: sean`: hehe, well I don't mind as long as I get respect from my boss
10:42  SugaSlide: im working 18 hour days at the moment for no pay :/
10:42  mekwall: sean`: and as long as I like what I do, money aint it all
10:43  doonie: i prefer money over respect :D
10:43  mekwall: but I do have a problem with a boss who says that I am lying.
10:43  sean`: doonie++
10:43  sean`: mekwall, what happend
10:43  mekwall: doonie: agreed, but I have none :P
10:43  SugaSlide: ive been in meks position :/
10:43  doonie: i have loads of respect here, but it aint paying the bills, nor the car :D
10:43  doonie: hehehe
10:43  SugaSlide: 6 years for like $450
10:43  SugaSlide: when going rates is like 3000+
10:44  mekwall: sean`: let's just say that he's put 50% of 2011 years turn-over on my shoulders - on a project that I said a long time ago I wouldn't be able to do on my own
10:44 * SugaSlide hugs mekwall
10:44  sean`: ?translate scrutiny to dutch
10:44  bot-t: sean`, Translation (English -> Dutch) - toetsing
10:44  SugaSlide: rofl
10:44  SugaSlide: mek :D welcome to my world
10:44  mekwall: sean`: he's been pushing his luck ever since, and now it's MY fault that we can't keep the deadline (which is in 2 weeks)
10:45  SugaSlide: im gonna be sole dev on a suite of web apps
10:45  blackspotwiggins: mekwall, srsly why dont you quit?
10:45  SugaSlide: OUCH
10:45  JKarsrud: sean`: I can't seem to find the config atm
10:45  SugaSlide: mekwall tell him to go screw himself
10:45  mekwall: SugaSlide: that's kinda what I did :)
10:45  doonie: amen to no more deadlines
10:45  soee: how can i implode all elements in array ?
10:45  doonie: its done when its DONE!
10:45  squeek: Altreus: http://pastebin.com/ATAccVGK simplest example I can give you.
10:45  sean`: JKarsrud, thank anyways
10:45  blackspotwiggins: if he needs you, work for him as a consultant for 10x the money
10:45  doonie: which in my case is nevah ;D
10:45  sean`: JKarsrud, I'll just try some random stuffz :p
10:46  mekwall: this is not the first time we fight
10:46  JKarsrud: sean`: You can set it programmatically too tho
10:46  SugaSlide: if he wants to dump responsibility like that on you... then he must give you free reign.. and you hire more devs yourself
10:46  sean`: O.o
10:46  JKarsrud: SmtpServer.hostname or something
10:46  JKarsrud: It seems
10:46  mekwall: he's an entrepreneur, everything in his world has to be done by his rules
10:46  mekwall: and if a IT guy like me, says it's hard... he might just say, no it's not
10:46  mekwall: even though he have NO clue what it's about
10:46  sean`: JKarsrud, ty
10:46  SugaSlide: those bosses suck :/
10:46  mekwall: SugaSlide: they shouldn't be bosses
10:46  JKarsrud: Let me check it with code instead of scouring our repos :P
10:46  doonie: all bosses sux :)
10:47  doonie: thats how the pyramid works
10:47  mekwall: he's good at what he does, starting up companies... but he shouldn't boss em :)
10:47  blackspotwiggins: doonie, not necessarily :)
10:47  SugaSlide: lol we should all start a company :P
10:47  sean`: we should get another channel for random crap :p
10:47  doonie: now go carry that cementblock *whips SugaSlide*
10:47  mekwall: a good boss listens and respects employees
10:47  doonie: nah my window is full sean` ;D
10:47  SugaSlide: hmm i learnt a while ago i dont have bosses... i have people that pay me
10:47  doonie: do you think they became bosses by listening and respecting ppl :D
10:47  SugaSlide: haha sean` :D
10:47  doonie: think again
10:47  doonie: else we'd all be there heh
10:48  SugaSlide: doonie my last boss wasnt too bad
10:48  mekwall: well, my biggest problem in this crap is that he is the head of the company... but isn't my closest boss
10:48  SugaSlide: and the new 1... well.. hes far from a typical boss
10:48  doonie: :)
10:48  doonie: 3 whips instead of 1? :p
10:48  mekwall: well in the hierarchical chain of command that is
10:49  doonie: kids, stay in school as long as you can!
10:49  SugaSlide: well... he asks the staffs opinions on shit... like.. "do we take on this project? how long you see it taking? whats the work load in it"
10:49  SugaSlide: every morning
10:49  SugaSlide: doonie++
10:49  SugaSlide: on that comment
10:49  mekwall: thing is, my closest chain in command left the company this new year, and everything I told him about how I feel about work, and that I have too much on my shoulders, haven't been passed along to his boss (who I am now fighting with)
10:49  SugaSlide: altho i did drop out like 4 years earlier from school lol
10:50  SugaSlide: (explains my spelling)
10:50  doonie: mekwall better if they know than you getting angry about it and leaving them clueless
10:50  mekwall: doonie: i've been leaving him clueless though
10:50  SugaSlide: mekwall whats the worst they can do? fire you?
10:50  doonie: SugaSlide and alot of other things ;D
10:51  mekwall: thought about to take it up with him many times ,but just didn't feel right to go behind my closest boss
10:51  doonie: the worst thing is to give him more work :D
10:51  SugaSlide: around here... being fired is like the mother ship
10:51  mekwall: now it's too late though
10:51  SugaSlide: labour courts = big payouts
10:51  blackspotwiggins: ok, maybe #jquery-OT is for this
10:51  blackspotwiggins: :
10:51  mekwall: SugaSlide: they can't do shit
10:51  SugaSlide: haha
10:52  doonie: blackspotwiggins u fooled us!
10:52  sean`: #jquery-sugaslidemekwalldoonieblackspotwigginssean ?
10:52  doonie: there is noone there
10:52  mekwall: lol
10:52  sean`: yes there is :p
10:52  Kasreyn: well thats funny. the developers at jQuery can run any code they want on your site and won't release sourcecode for parseTheme.css.php @ http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/css/parseTheme.css.php
10:52  SugaSlide: ajpiano we demands access to OT
10:53  SugaSlide: :/
10:53  sean`: Kasreyn, the themeroller is going to get redone
10:53  SugaSlide: well then... lets just keep raping this channel
10:53  doonie: guess who got a raise by chaning their job :]} <3
10:53  JKarsrud: sean`: ehey: this should work :) http://pastebin.com/MAKWbS3M
10:54  sean`: or at least an upgrade, I'll talk about getting it on github
10:54  squeek: Kasreyn: I'm curious, how do they run any code they want on my site? Because I think it's me and my clients running the code, surely?
10:54  mekwall: weei, just finished writing a 3 page technical overview over the project
10:54  Kasreyn: because the output from that php is included ?
10:54  sean`: SugaSlide, join :p
10:54  JKarsrud: Would still store some of the values in web.config
10:54  SugaSlide: tmpl.. how bad would the performance hit be to have a shit load of if's in it?
10:56  JKarsrud: SugaSlide: have you looked at Mustache instead?
10:56  SugaSlide: nopes :/
10:57  SugaSlide: i have json that comes in.. i need to show columns based on the data
10:57  JKarsrud: SugaSlide: Aha
10:58  SugaSlide: its a 35 column table
10:58  JKarsrud: You could do that with mustache.js, but jquery.tmpl is good too :)
10:58  JKarsrud: Whoah
10:58  SugaSlide: but only some of the columns should be shown
10:58  mekwall: this channel will now slowly die...
10:58  JKarsrud: hahaha
10:59  SugaSlide: i know i can... just... what kind of a performance hit will it be {{ if response.heading }} <td> heading </td> {{/if}} everywhere
11:00  doonie: *nudge*
11:01  ablomen: SugaSlide, you are using a templating engine in javascript.. the performance hit of a few if loop's should not really matter..
11:01  JKarsrud: SugaSlide: Do you really need to recieve the whole table?
11:02  SugaSlide: thought of using php to limit it
11:02  SugaSlide: i have a thing that the user can select what columns they want
11:02  SugaSlide: so basicaly what i did was add the template to a page.. with php if's around the columns
11:02  SugaSlide: if the user says he wants the column..
11:02  SugaSlide: then show it
11:03  SugaSlide: then when they close the popup it runs an ajax request back to the template page to get the "new" template
11:03  SugaSlide: load it into the tmpl part on the main page..
11:03  SugaSlide: and then reload the data
11:04  SugaSlide: thing is.. the template never refreshes
11:24 * doonie drops a rock in the water *plop plop plop* 
11:27  Altreus: squeek: Thanks - but I also discovered I can do parent.$ in the iframe :)
11:28  squeek: Altreus: that works too. I ended up using the target for my needs since it removed a lot of complexity.
11:29  Altreus: squeek: I'll bear that in mind and prepare myself to give up and go back if it gets too complex :)
11:30  squeek: Also it let me use multipart forms as well, something ajax can't do (I'm sending 20kb+ into my iframe).
11:32  BAttila: hi
11:33  BAttila: i have a problem. I try to make application with jquery. But when i can't trigering click event on newly crate element.

11:34  MadawarDawar: How come jquery .hide('blind',{direction:''},1000) does not work on linux
11:41  Lee_msi: anyone know when jquery mobile will support the datepicker/timepicker widgets ?
11:42  Lee_msi: its says in the blog (a while back) theyw anted to get them ready for the 1.0 release, im guessing thats the official 1.0 out of beta release not the alpha release version number ?
11:44  SugaSlide: how do i clear a tmpl cache?
11:44  rapha: Hi all!
11:44  coldhead: SugaSlide: reinstall your browser?
11:44  SugaSlide: haha
11:45  rapha: Among the various audio player plugins, is there one that could be made to disable the "play" button after it has been clicked 2 times?
11:46  coldhead: rapha: if i was on a site that only let me play something 2 times...
11:46  coldhead: you wouldn't like me when i'm angry
11:48  rapha: coldhead: it's for an application where i control everything - the computer it runs on, the browser it runs in (Mozilla Prism) and also who's got access to the room.
11:48  coldhead: Mozilla Prison more like amirite!
11:48  SugaSlide: how complicated can a tmpl template get?
11:49  SugaSlide: before it kills the browser completely
11:50  abracsi: is it ok to put <script>s wherever the hell you like in a document. and use $(document).ready(... on each
11:50  abracsi: for instance if you want to bundle a script with a segment of a page from a .jsp
11:50  abracsi: that may or may not be loaded
11:51  abracsi: like a navigation bar, that has a carousel, but the nav bar is only included on certain pages
11:51  abracsi: so can i just bung the script logic in with that part of the html in the navigationbar .jsp
11:52  rapha: coldhead: sure, but there's niches where it makes sense
11:53  rapha: coldhead: so, would it be possible to do with e.g. jme? jPlayer? I don't even know which one of all these audio/video plugins is considered state of the art / widely used?
11:54  coldhead: rapha: i'm no expert but take a look at flow player
11:55  coldhead: from the author of The missing UI library for the Web
11:55  rapha: coldhead: nah i want a jquery plugin that tries to use HTML5's <audio>/<video> elements nad only falls back to Flash if necessary. actually i think JME and jPlayer use FlowPlayer for their Flash fallback though.
11:57  impi: heya guys
11:57  ablomen: abracsi, it works, though it has a couple of disadvantages (for example slower page rendering) you might want to always load the script's and check for the existence of elements, this might make the page load slower on the first visit but visits/pages after that should use the cached version (with a bit of luck) so it will be faster after that
11:59  ablomen: so for example if ($(".someWidget")[0]) { doYourSomeWidgetCode(); }
11:59  impi: i do this: $('.date_has_event').each(function () { $(this).qtip({     - inside the .date_has_event td there is a div with a class events - and i am trying to display that in my tooltip: I use text : $(this).children('.events') - but is there not a better way as i get an error?
12:00  abracsi: ablemen, cool. however if it's a very small script then maybe it's ok to bundle with the actual elements
12:00 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
12:01  ablomen: abracsi, well the problem is, whenever the browser spots a <script> tag before other content, it will first run that script tag to see if it changes something in the dom, so the size does not matter (really!), it will still render slower
12:02  abracsi: ok thanks ablomen
12:04  impi: mmm
12:04  impi: how can i select a div inside $(this)?
12:04  SugaSlide: $("div",$(this))
12:04  ablomen: impi, $(this).find("blah") or $("blah", this)
12:05  impi: where $(this) is one of array becasue i get it with .each
12:05  impi: lemme try that, thanks man
12:06  SugaSlide: my way sets the context to this
12:06  gnarf: $('div', this)
12:06  gnarf: works as well
12:07 --- [1]Lee_msi is now known as Lee_msi
12:07  SugaSlide: ye
12:07  prs: hi.
12:07  SugaSlide: hmm... how many years before i actualy get a correct answer in this place? :/
12:08  prs: Is there anything like $('input[type=checkbox']).check(function () {.... ?
12:08  prs: i mean that $.check() function
12:08  blackspotwiggins: no
12:08  blackspotwiggins: there is change
12:08  blackspotwiggins: or click
12:08  prs: hmm...
12:09  prs: blackspotwiggins: thx for info, will try to create something from them.
12:12  pintofeggs: hey guys whats the easiest way to get the last word typed in jquery?
12:13  pintofeggs: So for example if i was to type: Hello my real name is Alex Thomas. How would i get 'Thomas' as a string?
12:15  Altreus: What does jQuery use to sanitize GET strings? is it a public function?
12:16  gnarf: ?jQuery.param @Altreus
12:16  bot-t: Altreus, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/

12:17  Altreus: ah lovely ta
12:17  pintofeggs: gnarf: can you expand?
12:18 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
12:19  gnarf: I would var words = string.split(/\s+/); words[words.length - 1]
12:20  Altreus: any plans for JS to support negative array indices in future, does anyone happen to know?
12:23  gnarf: Altreus: some impls support .slice(-1) like jQuery will
12:25  mekwall: Altreus: in a sense js already does, but .length won't count em :p
12:25  Altreus: mekwall: ah, hax
12:26  Altreus: I forgot that the same subscript notation is used for both arrays and objects
12:26  Altreus: I never understood why Perl differentiated but since using PHP and JS I've come to understand

12:33  Altreus: gnarf: yes we just want to know where this -1 index is stored

12:34  bot-t: gnarf: "test"
12:34  gnarf: arrays can have named properties just like objs
12:34  gnarf: -1 just happens to be a valid name
12:34  Altreus: but they don't appear in the array
12:34  gnarf: its not in the array
12:34  Altreus: Where is it :(
12:34  gnarf: array goes from 0-(length-1)
12:35  gnarf: its on the '-1' property of the array

12:35  tommy_the_dragon: i am getting some strange results from a piece of code
12:36  JKarsrud: tommy_the_dragon: oh really? how about a paste? :)
12:36  tommy_the_dragon: it is supposed to build an array of results from ajax requests (which are working fine) when i log the array at the end of the code however it is empty
12:36  tommy_the_dragon: http://codepad.org/49lruohU
12:37  gnarf: $.get is an asyncronus operation
12:38  gnarf: ?async
12:38  bot-t: NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
12:38  iszak: bot-t is a wet blanket, do it.
12:38  gnarf: anyway, that function callback gets called AFTER you've console.logged
12:38  JKarsrud: tommy_the_dragon: Use contents.push(data) :)
12:38  gnarf: try console.log inside the function
12:38  JKarsrud: plus, it's async
12:39  JKarsrud: and never mind my push
12:39  Altreus: arrgh if I include jquery tools, droppable breaks (from UI) and if I don't I can't have overlay
12:39  Altreus: ._.
12:39  gnarf: you'll need to find some way of counting how many operations you started
12:39  JKarsrud: it's just that the loggin is executed before the async call is done
12:39  gnarf: and then finish...
12:40  tommy_the_dragon: its the same after the call has finished anyway
12:41  gnarf: tommy_the_dragon: http://fixee.org/paste/n49gnd1/

12:42  tommy_the_dragon: how is it not
12:43  gnarf: ?jQuery.support
12:43  bot-t: jQuery.support: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/

12:44  sullivan0: are you sure you are getting a 200 ok and not a 404?
12:44  Kaapa: mekwall: woot! Thanks :)
12:44  tommy_the_dragon: sullivan0:yes
12:44  tommy_the_dragon: logging the data in the callback works
12:45  iaj: i think i need to go up a block < first.. how would I do that :S
12:45  Kaapa: mekwall: I saw in google a different approach: return !!document.createElementNS && !!document.createElementNS(ns.svg, "svg").createSVGRect;   You're confident on that one?
12:45  mekwall: Kaapa: you see.... $.support is just a set of different functions for feature detection
12:45  Kaapa: mekwall: you're seems cleaner
12:45  gnarf: tommy_the_dragon: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
12:45  Kaapa: mekwall: yeah, I know, but svg is not there, at least according to the api

12:46  tommy_the_dragon: after the request is complete

12:47  tommy_the_dragon: lol
12:48  mekwall: Kaapa: huh?
12:48  tommy_the_dragon: well its a link actually but whatever
12:49  Kaapa: mekwall: if I include that block on my code, in the future, when I upgrade to 1.5, I'll be overriding the function in the jquery code, right?
12:49  Kaapa: sholdn't I use an extend or something?
12:49  mekwall: Kaapa: yup, then you should remove it :P
12:49  Kaapa: ok - I'll use an if :)
12:50  mekwall: you can do $.support.svg = $.support.svg || function(){ ... }
12:50  Kaapa: yeah, thanks man!
12:52  Kaapa: mekwall: did you find that patch on the issue you linked?
12:52  Kaapa: mekwall: I'm asking so that next time I can look for myself instead of just asking. I can't see any patch in there
12:52  gnarf: not written yet

13:40  squeek: durin: the same webkit console is available in chrome.
13:46  rhandom_2: I assume #zoomDuration: 1000 means 1 second, right? Loading of clickable fields and regional maps seems to take a lot longer..
13:47  rhandom_2: Perhaps jQuery(document).ready(function($) { in http://javascript.pastebin.com/Pa7UMYFE is taking a long time after a while and therefore fields are not loaded?

14:14  unfo-: ¯\(°_o)/¯ no comprende.
14:14  Shwaiil: lol
14:15  ante: Hrm. I've a treeview that fetched the currently selected node with a jquery.ajax call. When a node in the tree is selected the page reloads itself and loads the view for said node. The thing is. When i click the back button, its using a cached result for the selected node, instead of fetching the actual selected node: http://ante.webbgruppen.se
14:15  ante: Try selecting a node, then another, then click back.
14:15  ante: The currently selected node is stored in a session variable and is fetched with the ajax call...
14:16  ante: i tried using cache: false on jquery.ajax, didnt help.
14:16  ehynds: Shwaiil, $('ul').appendTo('#someOtherPlace')
14:16  Shwaiil: ehynds, thats it ? Wow, thanks man ;D
14:17  ehynds: or prependTo, insertBefore, etc
14:17  ante: so my question is... when the back button is used in the browser, and an ajax call is made on the previous page, how can i make it NOT use a cached value?
14:18  Mr_Nobody: jomofcw: i have a lot of dates in textformat in divs, and i need to find the date amongst these that is closest to a compare date.
14:18  Mr_Nobody: specific date*
14:19  chilversc_: ante: back button is odd, I've found in some browsers when hitting back the javascript doesn't even run, it just restores the state direct from some cache somewhere internal to the browser
14:19  ante: chilversc_, that must be whats going on... idk
14:20  ante: it works in firefox with all the cachce options disabled and/or set to 0
14:20  chilversc_: ante: which browser is causing problems?
14:20  ante: Firefox (with caching on), IE, Chrome
14:20  ante: :P
14:21  chilversc_: ante: and is it sending an ajax request at all? i.e. anything going over the wire?
14:21  ante: I can see the requests in firebug.
14:21  ante: I tried sending along the current timestamp as the querystring
14:21  ante: to make the url be different every time
14:22  chilversc_: ante: I'd fire up a copy of something like fiddler2, and see what the response from the server is
14:22  ante: the timestamp was different, but the response was not.
14:22  chilversc_: ante: I'm thinking the server could be returning a cached copy?
14:22  ante: hmmm
14:22  ante: IIS 7.5
14:23  chilversc_: ante: simplest way to test is use fiddler2 and see what is requested from the server, and the response
14:23  chilversc_: ante: if its a browser cache thing, you'll either get no request go through fiddler
14:24  chilversc_: ante: server side, you'll either get the same response from the server or a 304 Not Modified
14:24  ante: downloading
14:24  ante: k
14:25  ante: chilversc_, installed on the client right?
14:26  chilversc_: ante: yeah, or a machine in between (though you'll need to enable remote access in fiddler options)

14:32  ante: But that doesnt explain why it works in Firefox when cache is disabled.
14:34  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, first of all dont define your handlers inside the actual callback

14:37  squeek: $this.parents('ul p') maybe?
14:38  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, can you reformat it so it would return all the data in one request?

14:38  blackspotwiggins: why dont you assemble the html on the backend in the first place?
14:38  klusias: hello. i got table like (<tr id="x"></tr><tr>..</tr><tr id="y"></tr>...) how can i get "next" tr element if i specify id (like - jQuery('tr#x'))?
14:39  rhandom_2: Is there a way to simplify: http://javascript.pastebin.com/0vW7SkKA After a while the click event no longer seems to work, perhaps because of http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
14:40  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, also, if you dont necessarily need a table you could use floated divs with 20% width to automatically create rows
14:40  ehynds: klusias, next()
14:40  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: so just geneate divs and add a class with float left?
14:41  blackspotwiggins: noeble that is one possibility

14:46  felixjet: like

14:51  StHa: can I call the same file twice without the file being loaded twice?
14:51  mizerydearia: var properties = ["border-left"]; properties.forEach(function(prop){ $(this).css(prop) }); <--- This chunk of code produces error in mozilla firefox indicating a.ownerDocument is undefined from jquery 1.4.4 -- Any ideas why?
14:52  blackspotwiggins: mizerydearia, this is probably not what you think it is in forEach
14:53  blackspotwiggins: also use $.each
14:53  mizerydearia: I believe it is specific to the forEach loop since If I put --> $(this).css("left"); <-- outside of the loop, there is no error.
14:53  blackspotwiggins: or.. why would you even do that
14:53  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: hmm u mean 1 ajax request?
14:53  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, yes
14:53  gnarf: mizerydearia: use $.each
14:53  mizerydearia: blackspotwiggins, gnarf, thanks
14:53  gnarf: ?jQuery.each
14:53  bot-t: jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
14:53  Znow: Anyone other than me that dont have JCarouselLite working atm?
14:53  gnarf: also
14:53  Znow: It loads fine, but wont work
14:53  gnarf: inside that function, "this" is probably not what you expect
14:54  gnarf: its likely going to be 'border-left'
14:54  gnarf: try var $this = $(this); before the loop
14:54  gnarf: forEach isn't available in all browsers

14:59  StHa: Can somebody answer my question please? Regarding the $.getScript calling the same scripts twice?
14:59  neekers: ahh, i can do alert(this) to tell me what the this pointer is.
14:59  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: ok. Thing is, why i get two separate requests is because Iam using the first req PK for the second request to get all related objects. First req contains teams, then I loop the team object and for each team I get its members in a new request
14:59  neekers: thank you stackoverflow
14:59  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: therfor I choose not to get all in 1 request.
15:00  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, you can do that in one request
15:00  mizerydearia: gnarf, blackspotwiggins I get same error using: 	var properties = ["left"]; $.each(properties, function(index, prop){ $(this).css(prop); });
15:00  blackspotwiggins: why cant you render the table on backend and just inject it?
15:01  blackspotwiggins: mizerydearia, wtf are you trying to do?
15:01  blackspotwiggins: $(this).css("left") does not do much
15:01  mizerydearia: Of course not, however, that is where I narrowed the bug down to.
15:01  jomofcw: it just return the value of left css properties for the element...
15:01  mizerydearia: What I am trying to do is $(grippie).css(prop, $(this).css(prop));
15:02  jomofcw: var properties = ["left":"value"];
15:02  blackspotwiggins: err wat?
15:02  gnarf: mizerydearia: "this" is "left"
15:02  gnarf: inside that function
15:02  chilversc_: bah, I give up, apparently, scrolling focus in to view when tabbing is a feature for people not using IE6
15:02  russinkungen: mizerydearia: you're trying to set the css of another element to this.css?
15:02  blackspotwiggins: mizerydearia, 1) you can set all the css with an object literal, you dont have to manually loop
15:03  jomofcw: and gnarf is right
15:03  gnarf: you need to var $this=$(this), properties = ['left']; $.each(properties, function() { $this
15:03  blackspotwiggins: 2) your last line does nothing
15:03  mizerydearia: Yes, I am trying to set the css property of grippie element from this
15:03  jomofcw: you missundertood the each thing
15:03  blackspotwiggins: 3) closures create a new meaning for this

15:07  mongag: I have json string like {"key" : "value", "key" : "value"} how to get key and value values with jquery ?
15:08  gnarf: mongag: you can use $.each to iterate objectx
15:08  gnarf: $.each(data, funciton(key, value) {
15:08  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: "why cant you render the table on backend and just inject it?", I do reneder the actual table tag and then I generate trs and tds.. by my code for some reason just keeps generating tds.. it never breaks of corectly with a tr.
15:08  mongag: I know that but can`t figure out how to get value of key
15:09  diamonds_: mongag: does this help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/684672/loop-through-json-object
15:09  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, i meant why dont you render the table on the backend
15:09  mizerydearia: gnarf, Thanks for pointing out that "this" was "left"  That helped me to resolve my issue/understanding.
15:10  gnarf: mizerydearia: np
15:10  gnarf: mizerydearia: remember, each function has its own meaning for this
15:10  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: Iam not with u, backend as in? servercode? or as in my html template
15:12  gnarf: ?eval var json = '{"key" : "value", "key2" : "value2"}', data = $.parseJSON(json); $.each(data, function(key, value) { console.log(key + ' is ' + value); });

15:12  blackspotwiggins: noeble
15:12  blackspotwiggins: yes as in server code
15:12  blackspotwiggins: do the request -> receive html

15:13  johncarlson21: Hello all
15:14  diamonds_: hello johncarlson21
15:14  johncarlson21: here is a script I'm using: http://pastebin.com/e1600hpQ
15:14 --- diamonds_ is now known as diamonds
15:14  johncarlson21: I am trying to figure out how to make it so that this works on different instances
15:15  blackspotwiggins: Noeble, you create everything in js? dont you have a templating system for that?
15:15  johncarlson21: it is a news ticker and I made it so that it can accept a param to either scroll up or down
15:15  diamonds: johncarlson21: you mean you have multiple sliders/carousels on one page?
15:15  johncarlson21: but if I use 2 on the same page it scrolls the same direction
15:15  johncarlson21: yes
15:15  okaycool: I have $(ul).mouseout($(this).hide()); but this hides the UL even when I am moving the mouse still on it. Any better method?
15:15  diamonds: johncarlson21: call the plugin twice, once for each slider/ticker
15:15  johncarlson21: I did
15:15  johncarlson21: let me show you that call
15:16  johncarlson21: http://pastebin.com/nvj80YPv
15:16  diamonds: johncarlson21: the two calls are exactly the same, you want them to behave differently?
15:17  mongag: gnarf: Thanks. That work
15:17  johncarlson21: no they are not one is for .newsticker-jcarousellite with a param of down:false and the other is for .newsticker-jcarousellite2 with a param of down true
15:18 --- avillanueva_ is now known as avillanueva
15:18  diamonds: johncarlson21: oh you are correct
15:18  johncarlson21: I remember some js calls having to be tick1 = call and tick2 = call2
15:19 --- ehynds is now known as erichynds
15:19  johncarlson21: but this one doesn't do that.. I think it has to do with the way that the code is created.. maybe not an actual class
15:19  diamonds: johncarlson21: that will call the method on the jquery object then return the object to the var (tick1 e.g.)
15:19  okaycool: how can I apply .mouseleave() with some delay
15:19  johncarlson21: right but that still doesn't give the correct effect
15:20  johncarlson21: maybe I need to turn off the auto scroll and then call it after it builds the ticker
15:20  Noeble: blackspotwiggins: my template is a html pag with django template variables, so yes I can generate tables etc in my template.. but how can I inject my ajax data into predefined tr/tds?
15:20  johncarlson21: what do you think? or will that still not work
15:20  diamonds: johncarlson21: I don't know :)
15:20  johncarlson21: hahahaha
15:21  johncarlson21: do you know of a good tutorial as to how to build a class that would allow instances?
15:21  johncarlson21: I also think it is because it does it in one return
15:21  diamonds: johncarlson21: hmm... are you familiar with the concept of prototypal inheritance?
15:21  johncarlson21: kinda not really.. I'm more a PHP guy
15:22  johncarlson21: but I've dabbled in some JS but more with prototype.js
15:22  diamonds: johncarlson21: read up on prototypal inheritance, it's different from classical inheritance (tl;dr: there are no "classes" in javascript, not like in PHP at least)
15:22  diamonds: that will probably not fix your current issue however
15:22  johncarlson21: yeah.. I know
15:23  sam___: hi
15:23  sam___: i have issue in jquery easy slider
15:23  johncarlson21: I do think it has to do with the way it was written
15:23  okaycool: http://pastie.org/1448324 this hides the element immediately, how differently I can do it so that the event takes place after slight delay?
15:24  diamonds: johncarlson21: could be... try playing around with the plugin.  that's the best way to get the effect you need sometimes!
15:24  johncarlson21: yeah.. that is what I'm doing now.. just thought I would ask.. :) unless you know of a news ticker that allows both directions and separate instances

15:37  tolborg: Im building a site where the owner would like the background image of the body to change according to the weather in our town (:D!) . The site dmi.dk provides information on this - that is, I am able to find for instance an image or a class on that site, which I can use. But, is this at all possible? I guess it can be done with a php proxy, but can it be done without?
15:37  johncarlson21: hhhmmm
15:37  Altreus: but the problem is, the $(function()) in the iframe itself is being called before my load function
15:38  johncarlson21: jquery site has this example: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/HJS
15:38  Altreus: oh snap it's probably because it was defined first

15:39  chris_k: johncarlson: sorry misread your question

15:40  erichynds: I've been been able to get consistent results out of ready()
15:40  erichynds: never*
15:40  sam___: anyone answer my ques

15:41  gnarf: Mr_Nobody: do you have a way to parse that date?
15:41  erichynds: Mr_Nobody, you'll have to convert each to a date object and calculate the difference in days
15:41  gnarf: because .text() should be about the most jQuery you'll use
15:42  gnarf: maybe an each, and 2 selectors

15:48  sam___: okay
15:50  gnarf: sam___: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/6YqaK/
15:51  gnarf: should be about the same as your post

15:52  Rayden[MODx]: im using jquery to do a sequence of things to an img inside a div with id. the sequence is: fadeOut, set new img src, animate (to set new with and height) and fade in
15:52  sam___: yes..the same
15:53  Rayden[MODx]: the result is not the right sequence
15:53  gnarf: Rayden[MODx]: paste the code?
15:53  Rayden[MODx]: it fades the new image in before rescaling
15:54  Rayden[MODx]: ok thanks, i must say i tried several aproaches
15:54  Rayden[MODx]: http://pastebin.com/e6xmUwYJ
15:54  Rayden[MODx]: now i post my previous aproach
15:54  gnarf: Rayden[MODx]: .attr() isn't an animation queue function
15:55  Rayden[MODx]: ok that might be the problem
15:56  gnarf: Rayden[MODx]: use the callback of the fadeOut() to switch your src
15:56  gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/caTBx/
15:56  Rayden[MODx]: how can i force it to do somethings first , then set new attr src, and do somethings after that
15:56  gnarf: and might i suggest against using "alt" to store the image?
15:56 --- [1]Shwaiil is now known as Shwaiil
15:56  gnarf: maybe data-alternate="http://..."
15:57  fr34k: hey $(window).height(); post me a false value... any ideas?
15:57  Rayden[MODx]: ok but the original image source is a dynamic generated thumbnail from phpthumb
15:57  Rayden[MODx]: thats why i put the real source to the image in alt
15:57  Rayden[MODx]: but you suggest better to use data-alternate?
15:58  gnarf: Rayden[MODx]: "alt" is a property that should store the "text version" of the image
15:59  Rayden[MODx]: im aware of that ;)
15:59  Rayden[MODx]: didnt know about data-alternate, so ill go for that then
15:59  Rayden[MODx]: thanks ill modify and see how it works out
15:59  gnarf: Rayden[MODx]: data-* are properties you can just make up
15:59  gnarf: attributes rather
16:00  Rayden[MODx]: ok and are those xhtml tidy?

16:02  Shwaiil: Q: Let's assume $('ul').each(function(index){ something }, I want that somethign happens only on mouseclick for each. How to do that ? Thanks
16:03  CRUM: russinkungen well answer my question and you will be added to my research pool
16:03  CRUM: what the heck is $('ul').each(function etc etc
16:03  CRUM: complicated code pretty cool
16:03  erichynds: Shwaiil, ditch the each and just bind "click"
16:04  jaredhoyt: CRUM: each() is an iteration method
16:04  Shwaiil: erichynds, thanks for looking!so, dont use each, but bing ?
16:04  erichynds: bind ?
16:04  erichynds: yes
16:04  jaredhoyt: Shwaiil: $('ul').click(function(){ ... });
16:04  erichynds: bind/click or wahtever you want does an each internally
16:04  erichynds: as do all setter methods on $.fn
16:04  Shwaiil: but wont the click be on UL and not in each LI ?
16:04  russinkungen: Shwaiil: err, are you trying to do what jaredhoyt suggests?
16:04  Shwaiil: ahhh ok ok =D nice thanks
16:05  Shwaiil: russinkungen, I need a function to be triggered on each LI click
16:05  Shwaiil: :)
16:05  russinkungen: Shwaiil: yes. $('.class li') to bind each li.
16:05  jaredhoyt: Shwaiil: you're wanting it on the lis?, then change the selector :p
16:05  Shwaiil: ok i'll use $('.class li') =D
16:05  Shwaiil: thanks guys
16:05  russinkungen: where .class is the css-class of that ul. or # for ids.

16:06  erichynds: gnarf++
16:06  russinkungen: gnarf: oh. sweet.
16:07  gnarf: knowing how to use delegate is a jQuery protip imo
16:07  gnarf: (and when)
16:07  pietia: any ideas how to add events to "share" links dynamically loaded via js? in normal flow i put FB-related code in the end of html
16:07  pietia: and then it adds events
16:07  pietia: to buttons etc
16:08  russinkungen: gnarf: yeah I know. peol is always ranting on about how he want's to make sweet love to delegate().
16:08  russinkungen: I haven't gotten around to reading about it though.
16:08  Shwaiil: Q: If I do alert(index), for  .each() index, I get [object object], how can I see its structure to use it ?
16:08  gnarf: russinkungen: its REALLY simple... you ever use .live?
16:08  erichynds: Shwaiil, console.log
16:09  erichynds: in firebug/webkit inspector
16:09  gnarf: $('.some .selector').live('click', fn) == $(document).delegate('.some .selector', 'click', fn)
16:10  gnarf: gotta run
16:10  gnarf: bbiab
16:10  pietia: i other words i want to reparse some div
16:10  russinkungen: gnarf: yeah, ran in som trouble with async postbacks in asp.net where some elements where added dynamically to the page. solved it with .live.
16:10  Shwaiil: erichynds, thanks. I know about the console terminal, but not console.log I'll google it =)
16:11  erichynds: Shwaiil, console.log is how you print to the console from within your code
16:11  Shwaiil: oh its a method
16:11  Shwaiil: console.log(index) returns nothing
16:12  russinkungen: Shwaiil: what browser? I think console.log is incompatible with ie.
16:12  Shwaiil: firefox =)
16:12  russinkungen: ah
16:12  erichynds: it works in ie8 w/ developer tools
16:12  russinkungen: Shwaiil: using firebug?
16:12  erichynds: Shwaiil, must be doing something wrong.  i assume firebug is open with the console panel activated?
16:13  russinkungen: does ff have a native console?
16:13  Shwaiil: I'm probably doign something wrong. But yes the console is open :)
16:13  Shwaiil: I'll keep googling thanks
16:13  Shwaiil: this is what i'm doing http://pastie.org/1448462
16:13  erichynds: click receives an event object
16:13  erichynds: not an index
16:14  erichynds: not that it will fix ur console issue
16:14  erichynds: Shwaiil, do this for index: http://pastie.org/1448463

16:27  eirikb: Have to be JSON, as content in a POST
16:28  erichynds: then JSON2.stringify
16:28  erichynds: jquery doesn't have that built in
16:28  eirikb: JSON2 would be the library I mentioned
16:28  eirikb: ?
16:28  eirikb: Ok, I guess I have to do that then. Thanks
16:29  erichynds: yeap
16:29  eirikb: :)
16:29  impi: mm
16:30  impi: if i put the content of my tooltip in a <ul><li> then it works, if i remove the <ul><li> then i get "a is undefined"
16:30  timmywil: mornin, it's snowing
16:33  houss: hello. i would like to add a jquery slider when a specific <li> element was clicked. So I thought I could append the html snippet to the Dom which contains a <span> element which should be substituted with the slider. but the event handler for rendering the sliders is not working, so the <span> value is shown instead of the slidebar. any hints? a sample can be seen here: https://gist.github.com/d93aa28b6ca72e38fd03
16:34  erichynds: houss, dunno if this solves it but i notice you're passing in the result of setSlider to bind
16:34  erichynds: rather than a reference to the fn
16:34  erichynds: so just do bind('content_loaded', setSlider);
16:34  DaveJ|UK: Can anyone familiar with jPlayer tell me how to programatically add files to the playlist?
16:37  Shwaiil: Q: When doing $(this).html() for a UL LI (wish has a UL has child), I get the parent LI text plus the child ( the UL ). How can I get just the child UL ? =) tks
16:38  timmywil: $(this).find('ul').text()
16:39  Shwaiil: timmywil, hi! for my case? wont that give me just the text? I want just the html =D
16:39  erichynds: then use html() instead of text()
16:40  Shwaiil: yup, thats what i'm going, but I also get the current LI text
16:40  erichynds: $(this).find('ul').html()
16:40  Shwaiil: The structure is <ul><li>first<ul id="child"><li>firstChild</li></ul></li> and so on.

16:42  erichynds: yep
16:43  houss: erichynds: this modification fixed an exception which was caused: "g is undefined"  But still no slider.
16:45  russinkungen: houss: are the spans loaded when the script is fired up or do you append them dynamically through $('#sliders').append(data);?
16:45  erichynds: houss, you're binding to the spans before they exist
16:45  erichynds: use live() instead of bind()

16:56  Jasmin_2011: yeah
16:56  Jasmin_2011: one is enough for me
16:56  Jasmin_2011: cause i cant found 1 in google
16:56  Jasmin_2011: maybe i got keyword error :(
16:57  Jasmin_2011: somehow i'm looking for a live url preview on hover script
16:57  Brodingo: someone probably has a jquery script
16:57  Jasmin_2011: example
16:57  Jasmin_2011: like i hover my mouse on the image
16:57  Jasmin_2011: and it will popup a box but with live url preview and not screenshot
16:57  mekwall: Can we go back to 2010 please?
16:58  Jasmin_2011: cant :p
16:58  impi: no fuck 2010

16:59 --- [1]Shwaiil is now known as Shwaiil
16:59  impi: hehe
16:59  impi: sowwey
16:59  Jasmin_2011: is there any script like this out there?
16:59  mekwall: http://home.comcast.net/~littlemoe85/thumbhover/jquery.thumbhover.js ?
17:00  Jasmin_2011: i need a script like this http://home.comcast.net/~littlemoe85/thumbhover/index.html
17:00  Jasmin_2011: but not screenshot preview
17:00  Jasmin_2011: is a url preview
17:00  Cryp71c: Does the .children() look recursively, or does it check only immediate children?
17:00  Jasmin_2011: like i hover the image then it can live preview google website
17:00 * mekwall is confused
17:00  Cryp71c: Jasmin_2011, previewing the live status of a website, you mean?
17:00  Jasmin_2011: can say so
17:00  Jasmin_2011: no need live status
17:00  Brodingo: jasmin are you aware of the same origin policy?
17:01  gnarf: Jasmin_2011: there are some services out there that can generate screenshots, but I have never needed this feature...
17:01  Jasmin_2011: is it?
17:01  Jasmin_2011: i just need a preview for my portfolio
17:01  russinkungen: Cryp71c: immediate. use .find() for recursive. (i think, still a rookie)
17:01  Brodingo: just go with a screenshot
17:01  Brodingo: much easier
17:01  Brodingo: save yourself some headaches
17:01  Jasmin_2011: i lazy to do screenshot save :p
17:02  mekwall: omg
17:02  Brodingo: then you will be WAYYYY to lazy to get a live preview working
17:02  jaql: i'm using ajax to inject specific content into an unordered list.  i'm doing so like this:  "$('ul#my-list').html($('div.some-div', data));". this works, but i end up with markup like this: "ul > div > li, li, li, ..." how would i say select all of the list items inside of "div.some-div" and just putting the li's inside of the ul?
17:02  Cryp71c: Jasmin_2011, trying to generate HTML from a target website to get live preview on the fly is a huge undertaking.
17:02  Kambfhase: Jasmin_2011: Well, you could create an iFrame upon hovering and hide it again later.
17:02  Jasmin_2011: ermm
17:02  Jasmin_2011: yeah iframe can be a good choice
17:02  Brodingo: lol iframe w css3 transform
17:02  Jasmin_2011: i want is like it get the href value
17:02  russinkungen: argh
17:02  Brodingo: so its like a tiny lil webpage
17:03  mekwall: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/content/thumbnail
17:03  mekwall: that's like ...
17:03  Jasmin_2011: like <a href="http://www.google.com"><img src="bla bla.jpg alt="" /></a>
17:03  Jasmin_2011: when i hover it
17:03  Jasmin_2011: it show google website
17:03  Jasmin_2011: instead of screenshot
17:03  ajpiano: Jasmin_2011: you would be MUCH better served using a screenshot
17:03 * gnarf steps back from this one
17:03  mekwall: Jasmin_2011: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/content/thumbnail
17:03  russinkungen: Jasmin_2011: check mekwall's link.

17:04  Cryp71c: ajpiano, are you using RIFE as an acronym, or the literal definition of rife?
17:04  mekwall: I wonder why some people want to waste both ours and their own time by NOT googling.
17:04  ajpiano: as the literal definition of rife
17:04  Cryp71c: gotcha.
17:04  Jasmin_2011: i do googling >.<
17:04  mekwall: Jasmin_2011: it was the FIRST FRIGGIN RESULT ON GOOGLE!
17:05  Kambfhase: mekwall: >> [16:56:57] <Jasmin_2011> maybe i got keyword error :(
17:05  Jasmin_2011: but the result come out is img preview

17:05  houss: russinkungen: erichynds: bot-t:it worked with delegate, but the selector is not unique, so only the last appended element is rendered correctly. In order to use a unique div id: is there another way to bind the span element instead of using bind in the click-event of the li element : $("uniqueDivID > span").bind('content_loaded', setSliderValue);

17:06  Jasmin_2011: thanks mekwall :)
17:07  ajpiano: in other words, shhh ;)
17:07  jspath: @gnarf so offset() is behaving as intended?  The docs say it gives position relative to the document ...

17:09  freedgy: Hey everyone, am I correct that $(this).css('opacity', '1.0')  would in no way affect IE?
17:10  Cryp71c: Noeble, for starters, your recursive controls seem odd? It looks like (lines 23-26) when your indexDesc exceeds the actual data, you call nextDesc() again and return, which would result in an infinite loop (since you're already outside the bounds of appdata and contuing to incrase your index)

17:11  gnarf: jspath: im not sure, but i think that could be a body
17:11  gnarf: er bug
17:12  gnarf: although, imo
17:12  gnarf: border/padding/margin on body = bad idea
17:12  gnarf: wrap a container around the content for that
17:12  freedgy: oste: obj.ID or obj['ID'] should work as well
17:12  Noeble: Cryp71c: looking
17:12  jspath: yeah ... a designer threw that on yesterday, causing my headaches :)
17:13  oste: freedgy thanks
17:13  gnarf: jspath: take it off, wrap the page in a <div id="main_conatainer"> -- apply styles there instead
17:13  oste: forgot to add the return type
17:13  Aamir: oste:  $.each(obj,function(key,val){   //you get key and its value })
17:13  oste: so it was returning as a string
17:13  oste: aamir that is actually what i am after
17:13  jspath: gnarf: think should I file a bug for this?  I can work around this problem now in a few different ways thanks to you
17:13  oste: take the data from the db and insert it into the dom
17:14  Noeble: Cryp71c: when appdata => the loop is done and it calls the other one to keep going, it actually loads fine
17:15  gnarf: jspath: i say file it, and ajpiano agrees

17:25  freedgy: Cool guys, thanks!
17:27  houss: russinkungen: it is only an assumption, but while using delegate i used the selector '#sliders > span', but this selector is equal to every appended element. I don´t know whether jquery can handle this or maybe i did a mistake?: https://gist.github.com/59aea8dfc78d98c08591 . Therefore I thought maybe it is necessary the delegate it with a unique selector, but I don´t know how.
17:27  Cryp71c: Noeble, yeah, at work, so my attention is sporadic.
17:28  ARTSIOM: I need a solution to move some content together with page scrolling. I have found this plugin http://kitchen.net-perspective.com/open-source/scroll-follow/ and it seems to be working fine. But seems like it is no longer developed for couple of years, so maybe there is some more recent up-to-date solution available? Or maybe it is pretty easy to do just with jquery without plugins?
17:28  Cryp71c: Noeble, ah, I misread "nextName" for "nextDesc" which would cause the recursion issues I was describing.
17:29  Cryp71c: Noeble, 1sec, still looking for other issues in code.

17:55  Cryp71c: Noeble, Firefox and Firebug, or Chrome and the dev toolbar (Ctrl Shift C)
17:56  Cryp71c: The dev toolbar is built into chrome, firebug is an addon for firefox.

17:57  Michael: Similar to firebug
17:58  Noeble: Cryp71c: ah nice
17:58  Noeble: Cryp71c: so, any idea why this is happening? I dont even specify anything named tbody
17:59  Cryp71c: Noeble, tbody exists implicitly, its part of the html spec.
17:59  Cryp71c: Though I'm not sure IE follows the existence of tbody as strictly as FX and Chrome.
17:59  Cryp71c: Getting a firebug equivilent on IE is a huge pain.
18:00  chilversc_: Cryp71c: for IE just use Visual Studio
18:00  Cryp71c: chilversc_, oh god, for a second there, I vomited in my mouth.
18:03  Noeble: Cryp71c: its odd tho when I specify it to add the tr to a specific table?
18:03  Cryp71c: Noeble, yeah, not sure with that regard. Perhaps a div implementation would be better.
18:05  devinrolsen: good morning all.

18:11  Shwaiil: Tks for looking
18:13  erichynds: yes, as long as $(element) is hidden
18:13  Shwaiil: erichynds, thanks once again :) like this ? $(element).html(  $(this).find('ul').html()  ).fadeIn(); ?
18:13  Aamir: Shwaiil:  $(element).hide().html(  $(this).find('ul').html()  ).fadeIn();
18:14  erichynds: yaaaaaaaaap
18:14  Shwaiil: Aamir, thanks :)
18:14  Aamir: Shwaiil:  you dont need .hide() if its already hidden
18:16  Shwaiil: yeah yeah ;)

18:21  DaveJ|UK: bot-t: thanks, im looking at that but i cant get it to trigger an uploadify event
18:21 * bot-t sighs
18:21  DaveJ|UK: $('#file_upload').trigger('onAllComplete');
18:22  Altreus: serio: ah, I didn't realise that events specific to plugins were applied using bind()
18:22  Altreus: That is almost certainly what I want then
18:22  serio: DaveJ|UK, have you tried $('#file_upload').onAllComplte(); ?
18:22  DaveJ|UK: yup
18:23 * serio shrugs

18:23  serio: yeah...

18:36  Kronuz: hello
18:37  Kronuz: hey, how can I tell if a DOM object has a onchange event attached or not?
18:38  Kronuz: I have some code that it's doing .change(…) on the object every now and then (attaching the same function) …but it's attaching it every time, it seems, and it ends up being called multiple times after some time
18:39  erichynds: sounds like a logical problem
18:40  ancanta: hi...whats the problem here http://jsfiddle.net/Kfse8/    ?? :/
18:41  Kronuz: ancanta: don't use <script> tags there
18:41  ancanta: thx Kronuz
18:42  Kronuz: erichynds: my problem is the logical? …but how do I fix it :P
18:42  erichynds: Kronuz, don't attempt to rebind the same handler over and over
18:43  toastyghost: that's happened to me before
18:43  toastyghost: you're probably calling bind or live inside a handler for another user-driven event
18:43  toastyghost: does it seem like it gets worse the longer you've had the page up?
18:44  Kambfhase: ancanta: no need for <script> tags
18:44  erichynds: Kronuz, also look at one(), or unbind the event first
18:44  Kambfhase: just paste your JavaScript in the bottom left box
18:44  Kronuz: I see some widgets, when they're called on an item they add stuff as .data()I'm not sure what's the convention for that, but my widget it's not adding anything to the data… I was hoping to use that to see if the object was already attached with it, and avoid attaching the event if it had been "initialized" before
18:45  erichynds: Kronuz, just unbind the event before you re-bind it
18:45  erichynds: so at most it'll only exist once
18:45  toastyghost: that's what i ended up doing
18:45  Trisox: like untie your shoe before you tie it again :D
18:46  toastyghost: it's a bit of unnecessary overhead,  but it definitely works
18:47  Kronuz: it did work
18:47  Kronuz: thanks :)
18:47  Kronuz: …what's the convention to "mark" DOM objects as being already initialized by some widget?
18:48  toastyghost: no idea
18:48  Kronuz: …'cause an "if initialized" is in place, to avoid re-initializing stuff
18:48  toastyghost: $.data( $('body').get(0), 'events' )
18:48  toastyghost: tried that?
18:48  toastyghost: (replacing body selector with element you're looking for bindings on)
18:49  Kronuz: other than unbinding events, I'd guess adding a .data('myWidget', widgetObject) to the DOM object would be best
18:49  ajpiano: toastyghost: document.body == $("body").get(0) minus a shit load of overhead.
18:49  ajpiano: Kronuz, if yr using the widget factory, it puts the widget instance in .data() of the elemnet automatically
18:49  Kronuz: and then if I call the widget intiializer to the object once more, I'd simply ignore the initialization?
18:50  ajpiano: Kronuz: there's _init and _create
18:50  Kronuz: ajpiano: I'm not, but think I should...
18:50  ajpiano: oh
18:50  Kronuz: I'm using a third party widget
18:50  ajpiano: sounds like you should ;)
18:50  ajpiano: oh i figured you were using the WF
18:50  Kronuz: and I guess I'll try to make it work with the WF
18:51  Kronuz: …WTF is WF?
18:51  Kronuz: (couldn't resist :P)
18:51  ajpiano: heehhe
18:52  Kronuz: ajpiano: if I use the WF, what happens if you "reinitialize" a widget? will it use the new options in the reinitialization or ignore them?
18:52  ajpiano: Kronuz, there's _init and _create
18:52  ajpiano: _create is only run if the widget hasn't been instantiated at all
18:53  Kronuz: and what's the proper behavior for widgets during "reinitialization"?
18:53  ajpiano: _init runs every time widgetname() is called without any arguments or just the options obj
18:53  ajpiano: Kronuz, not sure there necessarily is one
18:53  karimal: Hey guys, how can I check whether the first five characters are "Farbe:" ?
18:53  ajpiano: could depend on the widget
18:54  Kronuz: how do most other widgets work? what do you expect on those cases? do they generally use _init() or _create() for the most part?
18:54  ajpiano: almost all of them use _create only
18:54  ajpiano: only dialog uses both, afaik
18:54  crankharder: how is e.preventDefault() different from return false; to.. stop the default of an event?
18:54  Kronuz: thanks ajpiano :)
18:54  ajpiano: Kronuz, the WF protects against multiple instantiation
18:55  ajpiano: so the default is for it to just do nothing if you did like, widget() ... widget()
18:55  ajpiano: but if you had code you wanted to run on that second call to .widget() after it was instantiated, that's when you'd use _init
18:55  Kronuz: that's nice… this other guy widget requires me to do something like myObj.hisWidget().change(…)
18:55  saba: does anyone know if the change event for textareas are affected somehow by tinyMce? I've got tinymce on a few textareas and the change event doesn't seem to trigger on them
18:55  Kronuz: I guess I'll move that change to be a callback for the widgets options
18:59  saba: I have btw tried using .live () instead of .bind ()

19:31  swiggy: as you can tell, it just swaps the IDs back and forth durp durp
19:32  Kambfhase: swiggy: uses classes maybe?

19:38  serio: sounds like you should just be using a toggle
19:38  serio: like Kambfhase mentioned.
19:39  LakWork: okay so back to my breaking the chain question, the plugin i'm making creates a cascading country > state dropdown, the function is fired on the country select and accepts the state select field as a parameter. I'm not sure if retaining the chain makes a lot of sense here because the fields returned by the state selector may not match 1 to 1 with the country select fields
19:39  LakWork: perhaps i shouldn't implement this as a plugin at all?
19:40 --- Klarn is now known as rljohnsn
19:40  Michael: LakWork, For the sake of consistency it's good to return $(this).each
19:41  Michael: Someone else might have a reason for wanting it
19:41  Michael: And it's following the recommended convention
19:41  LakWork: yeah i certainly agree
19:41  LakWork: I think the best action in this case is to implement this operation as a standard method, and not a jquery plugin/function
19:42  Michael: Couldn't it return the dropdowns it creates?
19:42  Michael: $('blah'.myDropDown('init').find('option[value=FL]').remove() as an example I guess
19:42  Michael: )
19:43  LakWork: doesn't make much sense in this context, it could return the country dropdowns, but binding the state dropdowns won't work in a meaningful fashion because the country and state fields are explicity associated to one another
19:43  Michael: right
19:44  LakWork: the country and state fields *aren't* explicity associated to one anothe

19:55  swiggy: i dont want the lenght of the text inside the span
19:55  swiggy: i want to know how many spans existw
19:55  ajpiano: swiggy, length is a property of the jquery object, it will tell you how many elements are selected
19:55  Michael: swiggy> how can i figure out how many items there are with a certain selector? $('input[id^="this"]').length   will return the # of elements with that id?

19:57  swiggy: the count is to long
19:58  swiggy: nvm
19:58  Michael: BlaDe^, I've never used it. Theoretically speaking I would say store the coordinates of every plot points and when the user clicks, search for coordinates withint X pixels of the mouseX/mouseY
19:58  Michael: pardon the typos
19:59  Michael: Seems to be a common thing with me the past few months
19:59  BlaDe^: np, the thing is I don't actually store the points
19:59  BlaDe^: I guess I'll have to add some console.log's to see what the object shows for multiple points on one hover
19:59  BlaDe^: http://hackdispenser.net/usage <- if you look at 16:30 you'll see what I mean (3rd graph down)

20:01  Michael: seems like a bug
20:01  Michael: oh
20:01  Michael: Then.. 1 option lol

20:27  pfn: ?
20:27  pfn: basically, I want to run the effect until I call something to stop the effect
20:27  Mr_Nobody: paul_irish: I would if i could :-)
20:27  peol: oste: That sounds very very much like a no-go, sorry. Unless it's webkit integrated into some native app
20:28  pfn: or should I just do it times: 1, and have it call a callback that lets it know whether or not to continue?
20:28  Mr_Nobody: paul_irish: im sure ill learn a lot if you could help me though, im just a student.
20:28  peol: pfn: Just add a ridicilously high number, probably the easiest (which often is the best) approach
20:28  pfn: oh, $('#elem').stop()
20:29  pfn: so a silly high number, and then call .stop() when done

22:15  Krambfhase: if you want it to always be checked move the checked true line below the trigger click.
22:15  thinkt4nk_work: if it does, you might have to use an id
22:15  swiggy: without using a loop
22:16  cdtank: Krambfhase: Ihmm..k I updated the code so that the setting happens inside the click event handler > http://jsfiddle.net/tankchintan/8R9NT/7/ but still the same result
22:16  Behl: thinkt4nk_work: I'll try it. jsut a sec :)
22:16  thinkt4nk_work: kk
22:16  thinkt4nk_work: tbh I've never tried to select an element with an attribute whose value had square brackets in it
22:16  thinkt4nk_work: but... who knows
22:17  Krambfhase: ?preventDefault @ cdtank
22:17  bot-t: cdtank, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
22:19  pallet: Anyone ?
22:20  swiggy: i have multiple <lis> with the same 'style' id (<li id="item4sm1"></li> <li id="item4sm2"></li> <li id="item[x]sm[x]"></li>) how do i determine the last visible on of multiple? without using a loop

22:20  mekwall: hmm
22:20  Krambfhase: Behl: jQuery('div').filter('[name="abd[0]"]') works fine
22:21  Xenc: swiggy: $('#theircontainer').find('li:last')
22:21  mekwall: jsfiddle is down again :(
22:21  swiggy: ty
22:21  Krambfhase: mekwall: ZOMG, we are all gonna die!
22:21  thinkt4nk_work: Krambfhase > then what I showed him should work just fine
22:21  bartek: Good day. Currently, I have this code snippet: http://dpaste.com/307613/ ... Is there a way to do the same thing, without running two $.each loops? Basically, I want to add booking_id key/value into each object.
22:21  cdtank: Krambfhase: so here is the deal.. sometimes the user's click event would trigger the handler.. & sometimes.. it would be automated.. so if I prevent the default action. I will be in trouble. I know my example did not really help clarify this. sorry about that. but is there any other way out.
22:22  mekwall: Krambfhase: indeed... I was working on a project there :P
22:23  Behl: Krambfhase: thx I'll try that as well
22:23  Krambfhase: cdtank: as far as i can see you problem lies within your ajax' response. you rebind click there.
22:24  Krambfhase: FUCK, not to self: never answer to many request at once.
22:24  thinkt4nk_work: Behl, did it not work?
22:24  cdtank: Krambfhase: I was confused there for a second :P
22:25  Behl: thinkt4nk_work: was actually out having a cigarette so haven't tried yet
22:25  thinkt4nk_work: lol
22:27  RobW: Can anyone help me figure out why when you click the DOWN ARROW in the footer it disappears during the animation, then comes back up?
22:27  RobW: http://lifecouldbebetter.com/
22:27  Behl: thinkt4nk_work: works perfectly thx :D
22:27  thinkt4nk_work: awesome, np
22:29  Luwe: @RobW it doesn't come back here
22:29  RobW: what
22:30  Luwe: nvm, read your questing wrong
22:30  Jbar_: sullivan0: I check your last fiddle. drag out, drag in, try to drag out again. ;-(
22:33  RobW: so any idea why it's disappearing momentarily?

22:36 --- skione_ is now known as skione
22:37  erichynds: yeah
22:37  skione: was there any trick to it?
22:37  skione: by jquery I mean a modal popup window using the jqModal plugin
22:37  erichynds: ajax?
22:38  skione: no
22:38  skione: sorry yes
22:38  skione: I am loading the popup like this: $('#ex7').jqm({ajax: '@href', trigger: 'a.sendemail'});
22:38  skione: and it loads just fine just no tinymce
22:39  erichynds: bind tinymce in the "onLoad" callback
22:39  mislav: anyone knows how to unbind all live() handlers on the page?
22:39  mislav: and no, $('*').die() doesn't do what you think
22:40  skione: erichynds I am still pretty new to jquery, really only about 3 weeks in at this point. Could you give a code sample of what you mean?
22:40  erichynds: skione: pass this into the options hash:  onLoad: function(){ $("textarea").tinymce() }
22:41  erichynds: right after  trigger: 'a.sendemail'
22:41  skione: so cool
22:41  skione: jquery is so awesome
22:41  erichynds: ?mlu

22:45  jocrawfo: hello everyone.  I seem to be having a problem with 2 jQuery scripts conflicting with eachother.  On the site we have a device selector which works fine until we add our Survey code (jquery based) Once I do that if I click on the device selector I get an error message in firebug like so: $ is not a function
22:45  jocrawfo: the developers of the survey widget are a 3rd party company and by looking at their code it appears they are using JQuery.noconflict() but we are still having this issue
22:45  erichynds: noConflict would do it
22:45  jocrawfo: it stems from the thickbox.js file in our code
22:46  jocrawfo: erichynds, it was doing this prior to them using noConflict also
22:46  erichynds: does "jQuery" in lieu of "$" work?
22:46  jocrawfo: in which component device selector or survey widget?
22:46  jocrawfo: as survey has been altered to use noConflict
22:47  erichynds: survey
22:47  erichynds: you can either change your $ refs to jQuery
22:47  erichynds: or
22:47  erichynds: wrap your device selector in a closure
22:48  erichynds: (function($){ /* device code here /* })(jQuery);

22:48  jocrawfo: hmm ok thanks i will check on this as thickbox is a 3rd party as well I am not sure we will want to modify that
22:48  jocrawfo: why would 2 different scripts conflict when both were using $
22:48  erichynds: thickbox shouldn't be calling noConflict
22:48  erichynds: and you shouldn't be using thickbox
22:48  bot-t: Thickbox was abandoned by Cody like an unwanted child but jQuery UI Dialog is awesome. p.s. Cody loves his kids.

22:53  kvnn: anyone feel like critiquing my code?
22:53  jaredhoyt: it's bloated
22:55  jocrawfo: so what would make this other library conflict with our code though when they are using JQuery() calls and not $
22:55  dwarder: $('#1').('#2').html    does it mean that #2 is inside #1 ?
22:55  erichynds: jocrawfo, noConflict
22:55  kvnn: jaredhoyt : any examples? too many variables? not enough chaining?
22:56  erichynds: dwarder, that would throw a syntax error
22:56  dwarder: erichynds: but the idea?
22:56  jocrawfo: erichynds, so since they are using noConflict it causes this issue?
22:56  dwarder: erichynds: <div id=1><div id=2>lalal</div></div>
22:56  erichynds: if you mean $('#1 #2') then yes, but that selector isn't very good
22:56  erichynds: jocrawfo, yep
22:57  erichynds: jocrawfo, when noConflict() is called, $ no longer references jquery
22:57  jocrawfo: erichynds, they were not using noConflict prior and we still had the same error.  they implemented noConflict based on a request from our manager to see if it would rectify the issue
22:57  kvnn: erichynds : what is wrong with $('#1 #2') ?
22:57  mcnellis: how can I apply a custom attribute to an element and select it's value in jquery?
22:58  erichynds: kvnn, ids are unique, there should only be one element with the same ID on a page; therefore, $('#2') is enough
22:58  kvnn: erichynds : I've heard that specifying further increases speed. Is that negligible? Seems like it might be negligible.
22:58  erichynds: jocrawfo, then jquery isn't being included correctly, or you're using another library that is stealing the $ namespace
22:58  erichynds: kvnn, no, that would hurt speed for sure

23:44  matt_m: hello, I am trying to make the UI slider handle bigger in one axis and I run into issues when I changed the css for that. Here is the bundle I downloaded from jqueryui.com and modified "width" property of the handle: http://0xff.pl/tmp/uislider/ . Now when I click on the right side of the handle and start moving the mouse it jumps to the middle. If I click on the left side and start moving it's even worse. Am I doing something wrong, or it's a bug?
23:45  amh345: gnarf: was that for me?
23:45  mekwall: gnarf: exactly
23:45  mekwall: doesn't work :&
