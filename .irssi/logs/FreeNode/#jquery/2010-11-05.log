13:08  Guest2357: hi i have a question i want to make a image slide show, so i want to have six tiny pictures on the left 3 rows 2 cols (that can be changed by dragging) and on the right side i want to have the photo each 5 sec can someone tell me how i need to begin ?
13:08  Guest2357: the left pictures do i need to put it in <div>6 divs in this divs and in the divs a img ?</div>
13:09  hekin: I want to send a request to the server via jQuery ajax, and the 'data' is composed of form.serialize() and some additional parameters, what am I supposed to do to add additional parameters to the form.serialize()?
13:09  JKarsrud_: If you don't know how to structure your HTML, how do you expect to be able to write a slideshow like that?
13:09  JKarsrud_: Anyway, I'd do an ul with the li's floated left
13:10  Guest2357: why not div
13:11  JKarsrud_: Guest2357: Because a list makes sense
13:11  JKarsrud_: You have a list of images you want to be sortable
13:11  Guest2357: hmm is there a differnce in dragging in divs and li
13:11  Guest2357: ?
13:11  JKarsrud_: What you do to the large image is up to you.
13:11  JKarsrud_: Guest2357: No
13:13  JKarsrud_: hekin: What if you use serializeArray() instead. That way you can push additional params to that array
13:13  Guest2357: oke oke
13:14  hekin: JKarsrud_, great, thanks a lot
13:14  Guest2357: i try to code it right now
13:14  Guest2357: and then show it to you oke:D
13:14  JKarsrud_: Guest2357: Oke!

22:56  BinaryKitten: urm why?
22:56  BinaryKitten: i mean what is the end purpose
22:56  Hoe``: because i have a json list of element property values that i need to be a list of jquery objects

23:01  BinaryKitten: it's at best 2 Dom searches
23:01  BinaryKitten: and more for each item.. there is a much better way

23:02  BinaryKitten: 1 you're grabbing document
23:02  Hoe``: ok, thanks
23:02  BinaryKitten: 2 you're doing another 5 dom searches

23:03  Brodingo: RobW do you want the third class or third LI?
23:03  BinaryKitten: var obj = $(array.join(", "));    is the cleanest for your purposes .. as long as the items all have #id in the array
